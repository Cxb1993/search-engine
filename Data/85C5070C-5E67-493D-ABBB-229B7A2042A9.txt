Introduction 
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) ororganic electroluminescent (OEL) devices have 
been widely investigated because of their potential applications as high-efficiency, low-driving 
voltage and full-color large-area flat panel displays.1-3) Proper material design and device 
fabrication support the emission of variously colored light with at high brightness for use in 
single- or full-color applications. The white OLEDs (WOLEDs) have attracted particular 
attention because of their potential use in blacklights, full color applications and in lighting. 
Numerous efforts have been made to develop the WOLEDs, 4-7) including (a) a single emissive 
layer device with white emission material, (b) a multi-emissive layer device with blue, green and 
red emission layers, (c) a doped device with a host material and blue, green and red fluorescence 
dyes, and (d) a device that yields excimer and exciplex emissions, among others. Recently, F. 
Guo et al. demonstrated that a multi-emissive layer WOLED, which consists of a host layer 
doped with red dye into and a blue emissive layer, exhibits a maximum luminance of 16000 
cd/m2 and a luminous efficiency of 13.6 cd/A.8) Phosphor-sensitization technology enables 
fluorescent OLEDs to have efficiencies that approach those of electrophosphorescent devices by 
resonant energy transfer between triplet excitons in the phosphor and singlet excitons in the 
fluorophore. Phosphor-sensitization results in 100% internal quantum efficiency of OLEDs with 
radiation from the singlet manifold of the fluorescent dopant molecules. The 
phosphor-sensitization technology has been applied to in blue or yellow phosphorescent 
OLEDs.9-11) Additionally, since the conservation of spin-symmetry limits the internal quantum 
efficiency of a fluorescent device to 25% in small molecular OLEDs,1,2) the efficiency of the 
WOLEDs with blue fluorescent and red fluorescent emissions is low. A device that combines 
phosphor-sensitized blue emission with red fluorescent emission is a highly efficient WOLED. 
This work presents highly efficient WOLEDs that are based on a phosphorescent sensitizer, 
bisfs4,6-difluorophenyld-pyridinato-N,C2g (picolinato) IrsIIId (FIrpic) and a fluorescent dye, 
[2-methyl-6-[2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizin-9-yl)ethenyl]-4H-pyran-4-ylidene] 
propane-dinitrile (DCM2), which are co-doped into the host material, 
4,4'-bis(carbazol-9-yl)-biphenyl (CBP), as an emitting layer. The dependence of the efficiency of 
the device on the doping concentration was studied. An electroluminescent mechanism is also 
proposed and discussed. These OLEDs were simplified by uniformly doping two guest materials 
into the host material. 
 
Experimental 
An indium–tin–oxide (ITO) layer with a thickness of 150 nm and a sheet resistance of ~ 15 
Ω/square was used as a substrate in an OLED, and was cleaned by untrasonication in detergent, 
acetone and deionized water, respectively, before it was treated using a UV-ozone ambient. After 
the ITO was loaded into an evaporation system, organic layers were sequentially deposited at a 
rate 1~2 A。/s onto substrates at room temperature by thermal evaporation from resistively heated 
tantalum boats, at a base pressure of 3 ~ 4 x 10-6 Torr. The LiF/Al was deposited as a cathode on 
the organic film. The devices had a multilayer structure of 
ITO/4,4',4''-tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenyl-amino)-triphenylamine(m-MTDATA)(15 nm)/

Results and Discussion 
Figure 2 plots the current density-voltage characteristics of WOLEDs with 8 wt.% FIrpic 
and various DCM2 concentrations (0.6 – 1 wt.%) in the CBP emissive layer. The devices’ turn-on 
voltage declines as the doping concentration of DCM2 increases, indicating that organic 
phosphorescent materials, commonly adopted as dopants dispersed in an appropriate host 
material, typically have high bandgap energies and favorable carrier transport properties.13)

Figure 3 plots the luminous efficiency-current density-luminance characteristics of 
WOLEDs with 8 wt.% FIrpic and various DCM2 concentrations in CBP. The luminance of 
WOLEDs was maximum (17800 cd/m2 ) at a DCM2 doping concentration of 0.6 wt.%. The 
luminance is high probably because of the transfer of energy from FIrpic to DCM2 and/or direct 
dopant emission via capturing charge carriers in the emissive layer. 
 The efficiencies of devices doped with 1, 0.8 and 0.6 wt.% DCM2 are 14.7, 15.5 and 16.2 
cd/A, respectively. All of these devices exhibit a slow decrease in efficiency at high current 
density, which was caused by triplet-triplet annihilation in most of the electrophosphorescent 
OLEDs.14)  Excitons form in CBP with a singlet to triplet ratio of 25%:75%. Therefore, as the 
doped concentration of DCM2 decreases, more excitons can diffuse into the FIrpic device 
increasing its luminous efficiency. Accordingly, in Fig. 3, the luminous efficiency is improved by 
reducing the concentration of DCM2.

Figure 5 presents the EL CIE coordinates. White emission was obtained the sample with 0.6 
wt.% DCM2 concentration with CIE coordinates of x = 0.36 and y =0.39. The light is very close 
to the ideal white light with CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). The results reveal that white light 
can be emitted by the WOLED by the incomplete transfer of energy from FIrpic to DCM2 in a 
single emissive layer.

Figure 6 presents a possible mechanism of the transfer of energy in WOLEDs. Both singlet 
and triplet excitons formed in the host material CBP are transferred to the singlet states and the 
triplet states in FIrpic by a combination of Förster and Dexter processes with carrier trapping. In 
the FIrpic, the singlet excitons transfer to the triplet states via the intersystem crossing (ISC) 
process. 16) The DCM2 dopant enables the triplet excitons in the FIrpic to be transferred to the 
singlet states in DCM2 by Förster transfer. The DCM2 singlets then decay radiatively and emit 
light. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the luminous efficiency decreases as the DCM2 concentration increases, 
because aggregate-induced quenching is greatly increased. Furthermore, as the DCM2 
concentration increases, some other energy transfer processes occur. As the concentration of 
DCM2 increases, the triplet excitons in the FIrpic may be transferred to DCM2 triplet states by 
Dexter transport. Also, the DCM2 molecules act as carrier trapping sites for the injected carriers, 
some of which directly combine in the DCM2 molecules and then form excitons. These two 
processes cause emission loss, because the triplet excitons in the fluorescent dye cannot 
radiatively decay efficiently.

1. Introduction 
 
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been 
widely recognized as a technology for flat panel display 
(FPD) products today and for potential future use in the 
lighting industry. Several approaches for developing 
full-color organic displays have been proposed: patterned 
RGB subpixels, produced by precise shadow masking [1], 
conversion of blue emissions with fluorescent dyes (CCM) 
method [2], and white emissions combined with color fil-
ters and stacked RGB cells [3]. The phosphorescent materi-
als used were iridium (Ir) and platinum (Pt) complexes with 
organic ligands, and they were doped as an emissive guest 
into a charge-transport host material of the emissive layer 
[4]. In the study, we report the white phosphorescent 
OLEDs (PHOLEDs) with a single emissive layer doped 
with a blue phosphorescent material and a red material. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
The inset in Fig. 1 shows the structure of devices stud-
ied in this work, in which indium-tin oxide (ITO) on glass 
acts as an anode and the stacked LiF/Al as a cathode. ITO 
with a thickness of 150 nm and a sheet resistance of 15Ω/sq 
was used as a substrate in the PHOLED. After the substrate 
was loaded into an evaporation system, organic layers were 
sequentially fabricated at a rate 1 ~ 2 Å/s onto substrates by 
thermal evaporation from resistively heated tantalum boats, 
at a base pressure of 2 ~ 5 x 10-6 Torr. The evaporation rate 
and thickness of the film was determined using an oscillat-
ing quartz thickness monitor (Sycon STM-100). The active 
area of the devices, defined by the overlap of the ITO and 
the Al electrodes, was 0.3×0.3 cm2. All devices were en-
capsulated in a dry nitrogen glove box. A single light emit-
ting layer (EML) consisting of the 
4,4’-N,N’-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) host was deposited 
while being simultaneously doped with 8 wt% 
bisfs4,6-difluorophenyld-pyridinato-N,C2g (picolinato) 
(FIrpic), and 0.4-1 wt% 
[2-methyl-6-[2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizin-
9-yl!ethenyl]-4H-pyran-4-ylidene] propane-dinitrile 
(DCM2) via thermal co-deposition from three independent 
source boats. 
The luminance-current density (L-J) and the current 
density-voltage (J-V) characteristics were measured using a 
Topcon SR-1 luminance meter at room temperature and an 
HP4156A precision semiconductor parameter analyzer. The 
electroluminescent (EL) spectra and the Commission In-
ternationale De L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of these de-
vices were also obtained using a Topcon SR-1. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
Figure 1 shows the J-V characteristics of white 
PHOLEDs. It was found that the doping concentration of 
DCM2 increases, the devices’ turn-on voltage decreases. It 
means that organic phosphorescent materials, often adopted 
as dopants dispersed in a suitable host material, usually 
have high bandgap energies and good carrier transport 
properties. We also discuss the luminance efficiency vs. 
current density characteristics of white PHOLEDs as a 
function of the doping concentration of FIrpic and DCM2 
in CBP. The phenomenon of triplet- triplet annihilation is 
observed at a high current density [5]. Fig. 2 shows the CIE 
of white OLEDs with the various doping concentration of 
DCM2. The device with 0.6% DCM2 concentration has the 
CIE coordinates of x =0,36 and y =0,39. It is highly close 
to the ideal white light with the CIE coordinates of 
(0.33,0.33). Fig. 3 shows the luminance efficiency vs. cur-
rent density curves for all devices. The efficiencies of de-
vices doped with 1 wt% DCM2, 0.8 wt% DCM2, and 0.6 
wt% DCM2 are 14.7, 15.5, and 16.2 cd/A, respectively. For 
these devices, a gradual decrease of efficiency is observed 
at high current density, which has been attributed to trip-
let-triplet annihilation observed in all electrophosphores-
cent devices. We find excitons form in CBP with a ratio of 
25% singlet to 75% triplet. So, the doped concentration of 
DCM2 is decrease, more excitons can be diffused to FIrpic 
device and make device’s luminance efficiency arise. Be-
cause of the phenomenon, so we can know the luminance 
efficiency can rise a few with DCM2’s decrease. Since 
DCM2 is a polar molecule, higher doping concentrations 
lead to a redshift in the emission [6] along with a substan-
tial increase in aggregate induced quenching, which lowers
