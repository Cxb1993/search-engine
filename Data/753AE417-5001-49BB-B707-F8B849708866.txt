INTRODUC TI ON 
 
  Orthogonal frequency division multiplex- 
ing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation 
technology for high data-rate transmission in 
wireless channels and is adopted in a number 
of communication systems. The principle of 
OFDM is to split a high rate information 
bitstream into several parallel low rate data 
substreams and uses these substreams to 
modulate a number of subcarriers by Fourier 
transform techniques [1]. One of the major 
drawbacks of OFDM is the potentially high 
peak-to- average power ratio (PAPR) of the 
transmitted signal, which means that a 
complicated power amplifier is needed at the 
transmitter. Therefore, the subject of finding 
a computationally efficient algorithm to 
decrease the PAPR in OFDM systems has 
become an active research [2]. 
 
Recently, a novel modulation scheme, 
which combines the Walsh- Hadamard 
transform with OFDM (WHT-OFDM), is 
under investigation [3][4].  In WHT-OFDM, 
the Walsh-Hadamard matrix is added before 
the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or 
equivalently the transmitted data is first 
spread by the discrete time Walsh-Hadamard 
sequences and then modulated with the 
continuous-time  sinusoidal signals. Thus, a 
WHT-OFDM system is a combination of 
multi-code CDMA [5] and OFDM. Since the 
transmitted signal of an OFDM or 
WHT-OFDM system is composed of a 
number of independently modulated 
subcarriers, it results in a high peak to average 
power ratio (PAPR) when added up 
coherently. The high PAPR increases the 
complexity of the analog-to -digital converter 
and reduces the efficiency of the RF power 
amplifier. When an OFDM system use a  
Golay complementary sequence as input,  
the PAPR of the transmitted signal is at most 
two. These Golay sequences can be obtained 
from  certain cosets of the first order 
Reed-Muller code, , within the  
second order Reed-Muller code,  
[6][7].

system of length .   m2
 
  In the first year of this project, we study the 
Golay complementary sequences in a 
WHT-OFDM system with BPSK modulation. 
As with OFDM, the Golay sequences in 
WHT-OFDM are also composed of some 
specific cosets of first order Reed-Muller 
codes within the second order Reed-Muller 
codes. For example, we show that the vectors 
in the coset  
1 2 1 2
( )( )
s ti i i j j j
(1 )x x ... x x x ... x RM ,m+ + + + + + +  
with ts ⋅ second order monomials, where { } { } φ=∩ ts ,...,j,jj,...,i,ii 2121 , are Golay 
sequences in WHT-OFDM. Moreover, we 
classify and enumerate the WHT-OFDM 
Golay complementary sequences according to 
the number of second order monomials 6≤  
in these certain cosets of first order Reed 
Muller codes. 
 
  Many solutions have been proposed to 
solve this high PAPR problem, such as block 
coding [8], [9], selective mapping (SLM) 
[10], [11], and partial transmit sequence 
(PTS) [12], [13], and PTS is a very attracting 
one among them. The conventional PTS 
technique divides the input data block into 
disjoint subblocks of the same length as input 
block. Then we form partial transmit 
sequences by taking the Fourier transform of 
these  subblocks, and generate a number of  
candidates by linear combination of these 
PTS with different weighting factors. The 
one with the minimum PAPR is selected for 
transmission to represent the input block. 
 
  With PTS method, we improve the PAPR  
statistics significantly with only a small rate  
loss. However, the computation complexity of 
exhaustive search in PTS increases 
exponentially with the number of subblocks  
and PTS is thus not easily implemented for a  
large number of subblocks. In [14], the 
authors proposed an iterative algorithm with  
extremely low complexity, however its PAPR  
envelope signal due to the input data , or 
equivalently due to the spreading vector , 
can be represented as

B. PTS methods

  In the conventional PTS technique, the 
input data block  of length   is 
partitioned  into

the optimal weighting vector is selected to 
achieve the minimal PAPR to represent the 
input block . The explicit side information 
about the selected weighting vector should be 
transmitted reliably such that the original 
input block can be recovered at the receiver. 
Consequently, the PTS technique is required 
to perform

by -12M  weighted  combinations of these 
M  PTS. The complexity of optimal 
weighting vector search is computationally 
intensive for large value M and it is required 
to find an algorithm which has low 
complexity and good PAPR performance. 
 
C. Minimal trellis of a code 
 
  A trellis ( , , )T V A E= of length  is a 
directed graph such that the set of vertices , 
respectively the set of edges
n
V
E , is partitioned 
into disjoint subsets ,  nV...VVV ∪∪∪= 10
respectively 0 1 ... nE E E E −1= ∪ ∪ ∪ . For any 
1,...,i n= ,  a  vertex  is connected -1 -1iv V∈ i
ito a vertex iv V∈  if there exists a edge 
-1 -1( , , ) i i ie v v Eα= ∈ , where α  is the edge 
label from the alphabet set A . 
 
  Given a linear block code  , there are  
many different trellises representing the code  
 . The one which minimize simultaneously  
the number of vertices at each depth is termed 
a “minimal trellis”. For most purposes, there 
is no useful distinction  between a code  , 
and any equivalent code 
C
C
C
)(Cπ  obtained 
from  via a permutation operation C π  on 
codeword coordinates. However, it turns out 
that two equivalent codes can have very 
different minimal trellis representations. 
Thus a considerable reduction of trellis 
complexity is possible by column 
permutations of a generator matrix of  
[19]. In this paper, we consider the codes 
which have good minimal trellis structure 
with low trellis complexity for the search of 
optimum weighting vector.

In PTS technique, the optimal weighting 
factors need to be transmitted as side 
information. We can either use a linear code 
to transmit these side information bits 
explicitly, which is discussed in this paper, or 
integrate these 1−M  bits as implicit PAPR

Our proposed method of two-way Viterbi

new initial state before the minimal trellis

metrics  Lβ    by  using the  modified  
two-way Viterbi algorithm with branch 
metric,  forward  path  metrics,  and 
backward path metrics defined in equations

3) For all states in level , keep a number 
 forward PTS path metrics in

smaller PAPRs per state. Similarly preserve 
a number   backward PTS path metrics 
in 
BT
Lβ   with smaller PAPRs per state. 
4) For each state in level , generate all L
BF TT ⋅   weighting vectors by adding each 
one in  forward path metrics with each 
one in   backward path metrics.

5) Pick  the  codeword  in  C   with  
minimal  path  metric  as  the  optimum  
weighting  vector  and transmit it as side 
information. Then based on this optimum 
weighting vector, we transmit an OFDM 
signal with minimum PAPR. 
 
Fig. 5. shows the minimal trellis of a 
Hamming BCH(15,11,3) code with merging

bit  0  and  dash  lines  represent  bit  1.  
The  parity  check  matrix  of Hamming 
code in trellis-oriented form is given as 
 
 
 
The state dimension complexity of the 
Hamming code in this ordering can be read 
from the parity check matrix as  
. Before reaching 
the merging level 8, the forward PTS path 
metrics are recursively generated form level 0 
to level 8 and the backward PTS path metrics 
are also recursively generated form level 16 to 
level 8. The number of forward path metrics 
and backward path metrics per state in level 8 
is equal to 16 respectively.

under comparable search complexity, our 
method with error protection for weighting 
vectors provides  better PAPR performance 
than the one in [15]  which has no error 
correction of  these side information bits. 
  We also apply the algorithm in [16], called  
RC-PTS, to find the optimal weighting vector  
in minimal trellis of the code  
.  The RC-PTS algorithm is 
originally employed  in the trivial minimal 
trellis of the  (15,15,1)   code.  Simulation 
results in Fig. 8 show that  the PAPR 
performance of our proposed method 
achieves an improvement of 0.15dB 
reduction than that of RC-PTS algorithm, 
where both have almost the same search 
complexity.
