1.4 有效率的資料交換機制 
目前的製程科技及 IC 設計的資料量正逐步增加。ITRS 預測光罩檔案尺寸在 2004 年將達到 150 
Gbytes[2]。每日的晶圓製程資料及良率資料也需要有一個設計良好的機制，來有效率地支援資料傳送，
以完成一個成功設計週期及保證資訊的完整性。 
 
1.5 可靠的資料交換機制 
龐大的資料量交換需要有穩定的環境。任何中斷當時的資料傳送將引起良率資料的延遲；當良率資料延
遲的時候，它也可能影響良率改善的機會。所以可靠的資訊交換機制是必要的。 
 
1.6 即時協同工作能力 
在任何工程鏈設計週期的階段中，純粹的資料交換仍不足以支援一個平穩的同步設計工作模式。其所欠
缺的是一個即時協同工作能力，此需能提供各種不同的團體間能進行必需的討論、檢討、調查以及修改
一個設計等議題。 
 
1.7 互通性 
工程鏈管理系統中的每個應用程式應該能容易地整合並且具有互通性。具有這能力能使任何新應用程式
能容易地在這一個工程鏈管理系統之內被採用。這一個功能也能支援與其他的企業內應用程式的內部整
合，如 ERP、MES 等。  
 
1.8 產品生命週期管理及專案管理能力 
除了對於一個工程鏈管理系統的應用程式能力的需求外，符合一個工程鏈管理系統驅動力的觀念是來自
一個成功的產品發展。工程鏈管理系統所具備的關鍵能力是一個產品/專案管理系統。它應該包含專案資
源管理、專案排程控制、專案通訊以及風險管理機制等。 
 
1.9 設計績效評估 
因為 IC 的設計週期是昂貴且具風險性的，嚴密地監視對任何的設計改善是必要的。一個詳細的設計績效
評估能力在工程鏈的每個階段中的設計規劃控管是必需的。 
 
 
主題二：分析半導體工程鏈管理系統之領域知識 
本主題將進行半導體工程鏈管理系統領域知識的分析工作。 
本執行工作係由諮詢具備半導體領域從業十年以上工作經驗，且亦曾參與 ISMI/ITRS 以及 FSA 等產業協
會的專業經理人來進行相關工程鏈的領域知識的收集與分析。其中包括工程鏈範圍、能力、需求、安全
需求、檔案格式、通信協定、運作績效索引、系統需求
等部分。並歸納出工程鏈管理系統(ECMS)的支援環
境，其應具備四個關鍵的功能特性，如下所列： 
 
2.1 ECMS 能力 
圖 1 顯示 ECMS 應該具備四層能力[1]。第一層是存取
及遠端協同合作。第二層是資料收集及除錯。一個有效
率的架構能依據上述提到的二個基本能力，並透過網際
網路在所有一個工程鏈的團體中來進行連接。此外，關
於遠端的功能，像是遠端的工作檢視，遠端製程監視，
遠端的良率除錯，遠端設計變更，這些功能應該被建
置。第三層能力是資料分析。這一個能力提供進階分析
及報告，並依靠來自服務供給者積極的資料回應。最上
層的能力是專案與產品管理。專案規劃、查核以及控制
機制應該被提供來完成這一個工程鏈運作。

設備管理機制負責設備控制以及整合 MES/EES 系統；一個良率管理機制在工廠內/外部提供具智慧的良
率追蹤以及診斷的功能。  
大多數的封裝/測試運作服務供給者在同一工廠中提供封裝與測試等兩種服務。他們的服務管理系統有
WIP 管理機制、工廠管理機制、封裝運作管理機制及測試運作機制等。並且，一個良率管理機制處理封
裝及最後測試良率；它也整合代工廠晶圓的良率診斷資料。  
圖 2 顯示針對上述工程鏈管理系統的需求初步抽象化的功能元件。這些在一個工程鏈管理系統中將具有
關鍵屬性的應用程式，因為他們能夠相互協調運作而能改善設計的生產力。這一個工程鏈管理系統提供
一個透明且即時的環境給這些合夥廠商做為一個 IC 設計的協同合作。然而，一個 IC 設計者不可能只購
買來自一個供應商的服務，工程鏈管理系統也應該支援多個矽智財服務供給者，多個代工廠服務供給者
及多個光罩製造服務供給者和多個供應商一同運作一個 IC 設計專案。相互協調的運作平台也應該為許多
供應商針對相同的服務項目來隔離所處理的資料。 
 
 
主題四：建置工程鏈管理系統之資訊整合架構模型 
本主題根據主題三中抽象化的五個主要模組進一步地具體化每個模組的細項元件需求，並初步建構一資
訊整合架構模型，以做為各子計畫進行細步設計、實作、管理與模擬之依據。這五個主要模組包括設計

21. Introduction
Since market competition in the consumer electronics industry has intensified, short product
lifecycle becomes essential. A company that generates innovative research and development can
garner market share. The rapid development of the information and Internet technologies facilitates
the computerization of the intra-company manufacturing execution system (MES) [1-3] and
equipment engineering system (EES) [4-6], and expedites the networking of the inter-company
supply chain (SC) [7-9] and engineering chain (EC) [10-15] to move toward a global business
model of e-Manufacturing [16-22], [5].
National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing (NACFAM) [18] stated that in the
e-Manufacturing era, companies will be able to exchange information of all types with their
suppliers at the speed of light. Also, design cycle times and intercompany costs of manufacturing
complex products will implode. Information on design flows will be instantly transmitted from
repair shops to manufacturers and their supply chains.
Koc et al. [17] and Lee [20] proposed an e-Manufacturing model as shown in Figure 1. This
model depicts that e-Manufacturing fills the gaps existing in the traditional manufacturing systems.
The gaps are among product development, plant floor, and supply chain. These gaps consist of lack
of equipment, productivity, and life-cycle information and lack of information about supplier
capabilities.
Figure 1. e-Manufacturing model for unmet needs [17].
4Figure 3. An e-Manufacturing structure for the semiconductor industry [21].
The e-Manufacturing model proposed in [17] considers plant floor (for MES), product
development (for EC), and SC but not EES. The ISMT e-Manufacturing hierarchy shown in [4]
merely takes care of the functions of MES, EES, and SC without EC. Another model defined in [21]
also takes the related functions of MES, EES, and SC into consideration only.
To consider all of the functions and applications of MES, SC, EES, and EC simultaneously,
and enhance the integrity of e-Manufacturing as shown in Figure 4, this work presents an advanced
e-Manufacturing model that takes advantage of the information and Internet technologies to
efficiently integrate the MES and EES within a company (intra-company integration), and the SC
and EC among member companies (inter-company integration). With this advanced
e-Manufacturing model, the productivity and yield of a complete production platform can be
improved (by MES), the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) can be enhanced (by EES), the
order-to-delivery (O2D) period can be reduced (by SC), and the time-to-market (T2M) can be
shortened (by EC). Furthermore, the goal of improving agility, efficiency, and decision-making for
the entire semiconductor manufacturing processes can be reached.
In the advanced e-Manufacturing model, both the MES and SC belong to the manufacturing
portion, whereas the EES and EC are closely related to the engineering portion. The proposed
e-Manufacturing model fully integrates the four core components (MES, EES, SC, and EC) to
enhance the globalization and competitiveness of the semiconductor industry. The definitions,
missions, primary issues, and feasible implementation frameworks of the four core components of
e-Manufacturing are discussed in the following sections. Moreover, a testbed that demonstrates the
6Figure 5. MES operation procedures.
Notably, ISMT developed a SEMATECH computer integrated manufacturing (CIM)
framework (Figure 6) [1] to specify the common MES infrastructure and the software functions of
MES applications, and incorporate those MES applications into a coherent system. By specifying
the standard interfaces and behaviors of the common MES components, manufacturers can collect
system components from multiple suppliers. Thus, manufacturers can develop systems by extending
the common components and substituting old components with improved ones of the same
interfaces and behaviors.

Figure 6. Functional architecture of the ISMT CIM framework.
The SEMATECH CIM framework is an abstract model for typical semiconductor
manufacturing systems. This CIM framework is developed based on open-distributed system and
object technologies. However, the fragility and security problems are not considered in this
8distributing the finished products to customers [7]. The objective of the SC is to deliver the correct
quantity of the right product at the right time at minimum cost. The SC is designed to achieve
timely and economical delivery of products required by the O2D cycle [8], and to support the
collaborative computing of distributed orders in the semiconductor industry to ensure coherent IC
manufacturing operations.
Figure 8 presents the architecture of an electronic supply chain management (ESCM) and its
key processes [26]. This ESCM has been deployed in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) [27]. The ESCM architecture comprises demand-planning, allocation-planning,
capacity-modeling, allocation-management, order-management, available-to-promise (ATP), and
output-planning mechanisms. The demand-forecast process and purchase-order process of ESCM
are presented in the following paragraphs.
Figure 8. ESCM architecture and key processes.
Demand-Forecast Process
The demand-planning mechanism receives demand forecasts from a customer. The demand forecast
specifies forecasted production of a process technology required by the customer in a predetermined
period. Then, the demand forecast is adjusted by the demand-planning mechanism. The adjusted
demand forecast is sent to an allocation-planning mechanism, which determines a
capacity-allocated-support demand (CASD) based on the adjusted demand forecast and the capacity
plan. Next, the CASD is forwarded to the allocation-management mechanism for assessing demand.
The support plan is then sent to the demand-planning mechanism where a support commitment is
generated accordingly. Finally, the support commitment is sent to the customer.

Figure 9. A semiconductor supply chain using an adaptive real time WIP tracking system.
The authors of this work have also developed a holonic supply-chain system (HSCS) as
shown in Figure 10 [9]. The HSCS consists of several communication holons. Each company in the
SC should possess a communication holon. The HSCS employs distributed object and mobile
object technologies, RosettaNet implementation framework, and holon and holarchy concepts. The
systematic approach applied to develop the HMES is also utilized in constructing the HSCS. The
GH is first developed. Next, the communication holon is generated by inheriting the GH. As shown
in Figure 10, each company in the SC, such as Company I, requires a communication holon as the
communication component for correspondence with other companies in the SC. The
communication holon exhibits basic holonic attributes, such as intelligence, autonomy, and
cooperation. Furthermore, the communication holon can handle partner interface processes and data
exchange of various data formats by following the standards of RosettaNet business messages. As a
result, the HSCS can meet the future requirements of the SC information integration of virtual
enterprises [9].

Figure 11. The ISMT EES framework.
As displayed in Figure 11, the ISMT EES framework posits all the EE applications (such as
advanced process control (APC), OEE, FDC, PM, VM, and others) outside the equipment. Those
architectures are suitable for the applications of R2R-type controls involving more than one piece of
equipment. However, for self-related equipment applications (i.e. FDC, PM, and VM), such
architectures heavily consume factory network bandwidth. Another disadvantage of those
architectures is that all the data are sent to the same remote client for processing and monitoring,
which may result in data overloading to the remote client and further impact the real-time analysis
efficiency. Additionally, if the remote client breaks down and lacks backup, the entire prognostics
system is paralyzed [6].
To resolve the problems mentioned above, the authors proposed another EES framework as
shown in Figure 12 [6]. The proposed EES framework divides all the EE applications into three
categories. The R2R-type applications (i.e. APC and RM) are installed in the remote-client side; the
self-related-type applications (i.e. FDC, PM, and VM) are plugged in the GEDs (generic embedded
devices) [6] and distributed in each individual tools; the e-diagnostics-type applications are
implemented in a remote client via Interface C for security considerations.

Figure 13. Dual-phase virtual metrology scheme.
Fab-wide R2R control [38] is one of essential EES applications for semiconductor
manufacturing. The authors proposed to apply the dual-phase VM schemes to fab-wide R2R control
as shown in Figure 14 [36]. In general, a run can be a batch, lot, or an individual wafer. When
lot-to-lot (L2L) control is applied, the promptness of each wafer’s VM result for the feedback and
feedforward purposes will not be necessary. Therefore, VMII should be adopted for both L2L
feedback and feedforward controls to maintain VM conjecture accuracy. However, when
wafer-to-wafer (W2W) control is adopted, obtaining the real-time and on-line VM result of each
wafer in the feedback loop is essential. As a result, VMI should be used for feedback, while VMII is
still applied in the feedforward path for better accuracy.

The authors also proposed the concept of an engineering-chain-management system (ECMS)
to supervise the collaborations with EC partners and EC capabilities for shortening the T2M in the
IC production process. An EC environment consists of numerous design partners that are allocated
among different locations but working together to produce advanced IC design. Therefore,
considerable engineering data exchange is inevitable. Each professional partner of the EC focuses
on its professional work. The ECMS can support the operating efficiency of the collaborative team,
including first design success rate enhancement, design cycle time subtraction, and design cost
reduction. The ECMS supports the EC operation and engineering data exchange by providing a new
system framework and comprehensive operating scenarios.
Coherent IC design operations among many heterogeneous companies are the operating
model of the EC. Enormous quantities of data, including design files, mask data, process
specifications, and yield data, need to be exchanged among all the members of the EC. Therefore,
transparent information sharing is essential for significant design efficiency improvement and to
assure the first-pass tape out of an IC design.
To support the above EC operating scenarios in the ECMS architecture requires exchanging
considerable engineering data. Although, there is no industrial standard for EC engineering-data
exchange as that for logistics data in the semiconductor industry, an ECMS framework is required
to implement and fulfill the key requirements of the EC [12].
The authors adopted the new generation distributed object-oriented technology with web
services [23] as the enabling technology to propose the ECMS framework [14] that comprises many
EC agents. As shown in Figure 16, five main companies, including the IC design house, IP/library
house, masking house, foundry house, and assembly/test house, are consisted in the example ECMS
framework. Notably, each company must possess an EC agent, which is in charge of the data
exchange operations, to communicate with the other servers.

6. Testbed for the HMES+HSCS Frameworks
A testbed for the manufacturing portion of the advanced e-Manufacturing model has been built
in the automation laboratory at the Institute of Manufacturing Engineering, National Cheng Kung
University, Taiwan, Republic of China. This testbed has been presented in the 1999 IEEE
International Conference on Robotics and Automation and won the Kayamori Best Automation
Paper Award [40]. The HMES and HSCS frameworks were integrated and tested in this testbed.
As shown in Figure 17, the testbed contains four nodes: Company, Customer 1, Customer 2,
and Subcontractor. The HMES framework (Figure 7) [3] is implemented in the Company node. The
components of the Company node include shop-floor holon, scheduling holon, WIP holon, material
holon, equipment holons, equipment simulators, automated guided vehicle (AGV), automated
storage/retrieval system (AS/RS), robots, and exchange holon (for exchanging data between the
HMES and HSCS frameworks). The major function of the Company node is to perform specific
manufacturing processes for real products. The Company node also possesses a communication
holon that belongs to the HSCS framework (Figure 10) [9]. In fact, this communication holon can
be treated as a component integrated into the HMES framework in a plug-and-play fashion. (Refer
to the right side of Figure 7.) This communication holon is the communication agent between the
Company node and the other members within the whole supply chain.
To exchange information among supply and demand sides in the supply chain, except for the
Company node, each node of the Customer 1, Customer 2, and Subcontractor shall also own a
communication holon. These four communication holons constitute the HSCS framework as shown
in Figure 17.
Various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for all the nodes in the testbed of the HMES+HSCS
frameworks are depicted in Figure 18. Currently, this testbed has become one of the major
instructional materials for the course called “e-Manufacturing” taught at the Institute of
Manufacturing Engineering, National Cheng Kung University. With the GUIs in Figure 18, students
can manipulate and monitor the entire business and manufacturing processes that start from placing
an order at the customer site, then monitoring the WIP status during manufacturing and testing, and
finally delivering products back to the customer. These processes are fully automatic. By
manipulating this testbed, students can realize what e-Manufacturing and semiconductor
manufacturing automation are and appreciate the significance of large-scale, distributed, and
object-oriented systems.

7. Summary and Conclusion
This work presents an advanced e-Manufacturing model with four core components, the
MES, EES, SC, and EC. The definitions, missions, primary issues, and the corresponding
implementation frameworks associated with these four components are described and surveyed.
Each component plays a pivotal role in the advanced e-Manufacturing model. The MES improves
productivity and yield; the EES enhances OEE; the SC shortens the O2D cycle; the EC reduces the
T2M cycle time. With e-Manufacturing, overall capabilities, including productivity, yield, and OEE
of the complete production platform, can be improved, and the T2M and O2D cycles can be
shortened. Furthermore, the goals of agility, efficiency, and decision-making for the entire
semiconductor manufacturing processes can be improved. We believe that e-Manufacturing will
accomplish all the missions of semiconductor manufacturing automation and generate
competitiveness in the global business environment.

Abstract - The foundry business model was first developed by 
TSMC in 1985. A foundry should provide customers with IC 
manufacturing services. Those customers include IC design 
houses, integrated device manufacturers (IDM), and system 
suppliers. However, most electronic products are consumer 
products, and their life cycle has been reducing with time. An 
IC design house needs to continuously develop ICs with new 
functions to meet the current market demand for consumable 
products. Meanwhile, to support customers for high speed and 
low cost end product development, foundry service providers 
must also continue developing new process technologies, from 
0.25um down to 32nm. Unfortunately, advances in new 
manufacturing process technologies also create difficulties in 
new IC design. These advances increase the IC design failure 
rate. Currently, no effective working model and system exists 
to solve this problem. To formulate this high IC design failure 
problem, this work proposes a novel Engineering-Chain (EC) 
business model. This work also proposes an Engineering Chain 
Management System (ECMS) to help achieve the goals of EC, 
such as improving IC design success rate, reducing IC design 
cycle time, lowering IC design costs, and increasing revenue. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION – CHALLENGE IN THE 
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY 
 
The overall functionality of electronic products recently has 
improved at unprecedented speeds. In 1970, every ten thousand 
persons shared one electronic product. Today, everyone can own 10 
electronic products on average. The demand for electronics 
products increases significantly. To fulfill strong market demand, 
the improvements in the numbers and functions of electronic 
products are supported by innovations in semiconductor process 
technologies, which can produce the same IC cell functions in 
one-millionth of the space used by electronic products in 1970. The 
semiconductor industry currently dominates changes in electronic 
products.   
Three trends exist in the semiconductor industry for supporting 
rapid functional changes in end products. First, faster IC design is 
required to support shorter life cycle of IC products when IC is 
assembled in end products and the end product life cycle is getting 
shorter. Therefore, rapid IC design is required to support the 
change in the new digital consumer era. 
Second, Moore’s law holds that IC function capacity doubles 
every 18 months [1], therefore the whole semiconductor industry is 
striving to sustain this trend of increasing IC function capacity. 
New process technologies are developed to fulfill this trend to 
maintain its competitiveness.  
Third, owing to the considerable investment necessary to 
establish an IC manufacturing factory, specialization in the 
semiconductor industry has also become a trend. The current 
semiconductor industry working model functions as follows: an IC 
design house focuses on IC design, a foundry service provider 
supports IC manufacturing, and so on. Revenue growth rates in IC 
design houses (32%) and foundry service providers (29%) are, 
respectively, higher than overall semiconductor industry growth 
(15%) [2]. The driver of the overall increase in semiconductor 
industry revenue primarily comes from the new collaborative 
working model between IC design houses and foundries. 
Figure 1 shows that, in 2004, only 34% of first IC designs can 
be successfully released for mass-production [3] with these new 
environment changes and by applying the current collaborative 
fabless business model. Therefore, a new business model is 
required, along with a framework for accomplishing it.  
In the semiconductor industry new collaborative working 
model, a single IC design company cannot complete a new IC 
design task without considering manufacturing capability. An IC 
design is only completed and qualified when it is fully proved for 
manufacturability in a foundry production line.

Most IC design companies believe that the greatest challenges 
in the IC design cycle are cost and cycle time [4]. In the next 
generation of process technology, mask cost will increase 100% [5]. 
Mask costs are doubled following each failure of the first IC design. 
The IC design company must pay reworking costs and the new 
project is left idle while waiting for second and even third rework 
results. The IC design cycle is extended and design costs are 
increased. Increasing first design success rate not only reduces 
design costs and IC design cycle time, but also increases revenue 
via earlier market entry. 
High design success rate will not require IC design reworking 
and increase the overall product revenue. Recent studies found that 
applying a new process technology and embedding more functions 
in an IC may increase the failure rate of IC design [3]. While more 
functions are designed into one IC chip and a new process 
technology is used for wafer fabrication, the increased design 
complexity of process technology makes it difficult to obtain a 
high success rate for first IC design.  
Comparing to IC design work with previous process 
technologies (>0.13um), more process information is required for

operations of a single 
semiconductor company. 
Due to the evolution of the new business model, as depicted in 
Fig. 4, different from IDM’s (integrated design and manufacturing) 
operations, current IC design, 
wafer manufacturing, IC 
assembly and test are handled by 
a new collaborative working 
team – fabless design house, 
foundry service provider, and 
assembly service provider. 
Consequently, the traditional 
CIM scope needs to be enhanced 
for including the supply chain 
management system (using 
RosettaNet framework for 
example) and the ECMS to 
produce a new comprehensive 
CIM architecture for supporting 
this new e-manufacturing 
operation [10][11]. Figure 5 
shows this new CIM scope. 
The CIM framework of 
SEMATECH has become the 
automation standard for 
semiconductors [12]-[14]. This 
study follows the same 
methodology to establish the 
CIM framework to develop the 
ECMS framework. Therefore, 
the ECMS framework presented 
in this work is designed to 
provide a modular, 
component-based application 
architecture that satisfies several objectives, including 
interoperability, substitutability, extendibility, and reuse of 
applications [16][17]. The ECMS requirements used to define 
functional components and operating scenarios are summarized in 
the following section. This work further develops the ECMS 
framework to produce better leveraging distributed computing 
standards and details application integration among components. 
 
IV. REQUIREMENTS OF THE ENGINEERING CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
An EC environment involves numerous design partners 
allocated among different locations working together to produce 
advanced IC design and engaged in considerable engineering data 
exchange. Each professional partner of the EC focuses on his 
professional work. As a coherent operation platform, the ECMS 
supports the realization of the competitive advantage of each 
member in the design cycle achieved via collaboration through 
transparent information exchange. The ECMS can support the 
operating efficiency of the collaborative team – including first 
design success rate enhancement, design cycle time subtraction, and 
finally design cost reduction. The ECMS supports EC operation and 
engineering data exchange by providing a new system framework 
and comprehensive operating scenarios. 
To fulfill the expected performance of the ECMS, the key 
requirements are as follows [11][15]: 
1) Distributed Operation 
2) Integration Capability 
3) Security Control 
4) Efficient Data Exchange Mechanism 
5) Reliable Data Exchange Mechanism 
6) Real-time Co-work Capability 
7) Interoperability 
8) Product Life Cycle Management and Project Management 
Capability

services in the same factory. Their assembly/test service 
management server includes a WIP management application, a shop 
floor management application, an assembly operation management 
application and a test operation application.   
As depicted in Fig. 7, each of the ECMS servers possesses a 
communication manager responsible for engineering data 
management operations – including data request, data classification 
and XLST (XML Stylesheets) data format conversion. These 
common functions can then be identified and designed in a generic 
communication component, called the generic communication agent 
(GC agent). Afterwards, each communication manager (of all the 
ECMS servers) can be constructed by inheriting the GC agent and 
adding specific functions for this communication manager. 
Figure 8 illustrates the functional blocks of the 
GC agent. The GC agent is basically designed to 
support several common functions of the ECMS: GC 
communication kernel, SOAP (Simple Object 
Access Protocol) communication interface, UDDI 
(Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) 
registry mechanism, data classification mechanism, 
XSLT mechanism, and local database. 
Another common function in each ECMS server 
for data exchange is identified and developed via an 
EC agent. Notably, the GC agent is mainly 
responsible for common data management operation, 
while the EC agent is in charge of data exchange 
operation. 
Figure 9 illustrates the functional blocks of the EC agent that 
possesses the generic functions of data exchange. These generic 
functions include a SOAP communication module for establishing 
the communication backbone; a security logging module to 
maintain all connection and data transfer records; a certificate 
management module for managing certification dispatch and 
registration; an authentication and authorization module as well as a 
user policies and profile 
management module to 
manage data security 
functionality; an XML 
signature and XML 
encryption module to 
manage data exchange 
via defined standards; a 
large-data transfer 
module to handle 
exchange of large 
amounts of data; a data 
quality module to ensure 
data quality and error 
recovery; and a data 
communication and 
integration services 
module to provide the 
network services jointly 
agreed upon by 
collaborative partners. 
Finally, the EC 
communication kernel 
manages and applies the 
above-mentioned 
modules to achieve 
secure, robust, and 
efficient data exchange to 
support an IC design 
project in an EC 
environment.

C. ECMS Framework Messages 
 
After completing the design of all of the ECMS functional 
servers, it is necessary to define the associated framework messages 
among and in-between all of the functional servers to enable 
interoperability and collaboration. Owing to lack of space, only the 
framework messages of yield data exchange between the design 
house and foundry service are illustrated. Figure 10 shows a
