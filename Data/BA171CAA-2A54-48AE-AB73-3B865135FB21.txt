1. Introduction  
The quality of the micrometer-sized display pixels depends both on the basic material properties 
(Hanaguchi and Yoshino 1996; Wang et al. 1997a, 1997b, 1999a, 1999b; Sun et al. 2000) and the 
nature of the manufacturing processes such as vacuum depositing (Adachi et al. 2001; Holmes et 
al. 2003), spin coating (Burroughes et al. 1990; Braun and Heeger, 1991), inkjet printing (IJP) 
(Hebner 1998; Chang 1998; Hayes 1999; Yang et al.2000; Edwards and Albertalli 2001; Fuller et 
al. 2002; Antoniadis et al. 2003; Bennett et al. 2003; Yamazaki et al. 2004; Bennett and Albertalli 
2005; Gupta 2005; Duineveld et al. 2007; Yu et al. 2007; Liou et al. 2008, 2009), and laser-
induced thermal imaging (Wolk et al. 2001). Inkjet printing technology is suggested for patterning 
multicolor polymer light-emitting-diodes (PLEDs) due to its high resolution, multicolor patterning, 
solution thrift, lateral patterning capability, and compatible with conventional photolithography. 
The present study focuses on the application of IJP in the field of film deposition. 
 
The manufacturing process of PLEDs consists of microstructured substrate (microcavities) 
fabrication and reactive ion etching (RIE) or plasma pretreatment on microcavities. Inside the 
microcavities it involves with depositing poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) solution to 
form the hole transport conducting layer, printing poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-
phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) light-emitting polymer (LEP) layers, and depositing cathode and 
encapsulating thin films. Dispensing these polymer droplets with volume of several picoliters from 
an inkjet printhead into the pre-fabricated rectangular microcavities (Figs. 1-2) is the key step of 
manufacturing PLED display panels. One of manufacturing and fluidic bottlenecks is the solution 
viscosity (µ) and surface tension (σ). Improper fluid properties are liable to generate satellite 
droplets during flight (Wolk et al. 2001; Liou et al. 2010) and undesired polymer layers during 
impact process (Liou et al. 2008, 2009). Also, the alignment and eccentricity of nozzles are 
another issue that should not be ignored. For instance, the solution with µ lower than 1 cps could 
be ejected with larger deviation angle and the solution with µ higher than 5 cps would be hard to 
be ejected through the tiny nozzle opening. The precision of the droplet deposition location needs 
to be well under ±20 µm for a 1500 µm gap between the nozzle and the substrate to manufacture 
many of today’s color displays (Edwards and Albertalli 2001). Moreover, large droplet (～1 mm) 
jetting inertia could lead to the splash phenomena causing non-uniformity of the polymer layer on 
the substrate (Worthington 1908; Yarin 2006; Subramani et al. 2007). In contrast, the inertia of the 
micron-sized impacting droplet although operated at high velocities has been shown recently to be 
far below the critical value for the occurrence of splashing phenomena observed for millimeter-
sized drops (Liou et al. 2010). Last, contact angles (θ) between droplets and microcavity walls are 
decisive factor on the final deposited patterns at equilibrium (Liou et al. 2008, 2009). Thus, the 
nature of droplet impingement upon the microcavity is closely related to the surface characteristics 
and the initial state of droplet. It is obvious that among the aforementioned issues, the initial state 
of droplet needs more studies.

complementary CFD method. The influences of D, Vd, and the microcavity length-to-width ratio 
(L/W) with a fixed bottom area on the droplet deposition results will be studied as well. 
Furthermore, the acquired results will be compared with those available from the literature in 
terms of the relevant parameters. 
2. Experimental system and parameters examined  
2.1 PIJ printhead and micro cavities 
The upper part of Fig.1 depicts a schematic of internal ink flow passages and actuators of a 
commercial drop-on-demand PIJ printhead (EPSON C45). The actuator consists of a dome-shaped 
PZT membrane and two electrodes. The former has a thickness of 30 µm and a cross section of 
870 µm × 160 µm bounded onto the ink ejecting chamber for periodically actuating ink flow 
whereas the latter forms an electrical field in parallel with the polarization of the PZT membrane. 
The ink flow passages comprise an inlet channel (310 µm × 160 µm × 175 µm) for supplying ink 
from an ink reservoir, an ink ejecting chamber (870 µm × 160 µm × 100 µm) for actuating the ink 
flow, an ink communicating chamber (160 µm × 160 µm × 350 µm) for propagating the ink fluid, 
and a convergent nozzle (Dn = 26 µm) for accelerating the ink flow.  
 
A schematic of droplets ejecting from nozzles and impacting onto microcavities is shown in the 
lower part of Fig.1. The resolution of the square microcavities is chosen as 150 ppi (49 µm pixel 
width) (Bennett and Albertalli 2005) in view of the droplet diameter being close to the nozzle 
diameter (26 µm) with about a 12-µm clearance between the droplet and resist (sidewall). A soda 
lime glass was employed as a transparent substrate. SU-8 2050 was spun onto the cleaned 
substrate to obtain a resist thickness of 75 µm. Each microcavity has a tapered angle of 7° and a 
fixed bottom area of 49 µm × 49 µm (Figs.1-2). The PEDOT solution used for IJP was prepared by 
mixing PEDOT (1.5 wt %), water-based black dye (0.15 wt %), and non-ionic surfactant (0.2 wt %) 
in deionized water (98.15 wt %). It has a measured µ of 3 cps and σ of 0.053 N/m. It is noted that 
the weight percent of the solution is extremely low so that it could be considered as a Newtonian 
fluid. θs and θb for the PEDOT solution were measured by a contact angle goniometer employing a 
microscope optical system and a high resolution charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and play 
the role of boundary conditions (BCs).  
2.2 µ-FV system  
Figure 3 depicts the µ-FV system for observing the equilibrium results of droplet depositions in the 
fabricated microcavities on the substrate. It comprises a signal generator (nF WF1944) with an 
oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS-3054C), a high-speed amplifier (nF HSA4011), a LED (Tai-Shing 
L053SBLC), two CCD cameras (Xli 3M) incorporated with optical microscopes (OPTEM ZOOM 
70), and personal computers (PCs). The printhead mounted 1 mm above a target substrate expelled 
droplets downward under a 10 kHz actuating waveform (Fig. 3). The distance of 1 mm was chosen 
according to Fuller et al (2002). It is generally between 0.6 mm (the distance needed for the all 
droplet ligaments pulled into main droplets in our experiments) and 1.5 mm (Bennett and 
Albertalli 2005). Beyond the range the distance will affect droplet and pixel formation. To deposit

where F is the fluid volume fraction, i.e. F = 1 and F = 0 for grid cells filled by liquid and air, 
respectively, and 0 < F < 1 for grid cells filled by both fluids. Both fluids are treated as a single 
effective fluid, whose physical properties vary in space and are calculated according to F in grid 
cells. ρ and µ are determined by a linear interpolation according to the volume fraction in a cell, i.e. 
β = Fβl + (1 - F) βg, where β denotes the fluid property inside a cell. Further, the fluids sharing a 
cell (i.e. 0 < F < 1) are assumed to have identical velocity, pressure and other properties. Because 
both fluids are computed, the grid used to discretize the computation domain extends over both 
fluids. The free surface is implicitly defined at F = 0.5. 
 
The surface tension force in (2) is calculated by a continuum surface force model (Brackbill et al. 
1992). This model uses the gradient of F to define the normal vector at the interface pointing from 
gas to liquid. The determination of surface tension fiσ is given by:

At the ambient area of the external flow field (Fig.4), the pressures are Dirichlet boundary 
conditions of 1 atm. At the solid walls the no-slip wall BCs are used. θn at liquid-solid interface is 
specified at the wall boundary of the microcavity flow field. The surface tension force of the liquid 
and gas interface at the wall boundary is computed as follows (Brackbill et al. 1992):

4.2 Effect of Vd or D on droplet deposition in a square microcavity 
Figure 7 depicts the experimentally obtained top-view images of the deposited PEDOT film 
configurations at equilibrium (t**=1.000 with t**=t/Tt and Tt=1 ms) under various Vd and D. The 
lack of side-view images is due to the opaque side wall of the fabricated microcavity arrays. For 
the droplets with small velocities 3.5 m/s and diameters 22.4 µm to 22.7 µm the droplets after 
impact form a dome-like (or an igloo-like) layer without wetting the sidewalls, a pattern similar to 
that observed for the droplet impacting upon a flat surface. However, once the spread of impacting 
droplet touches the sidewalls (Vd＞3.5 m/s or D＞22.7 µm) as a result of a higher inertia force 
(ρVd2 D), the droplet will then be pulled outward by the hydrophilicity (or the adhesive force) of 
the side walls (θs = 50° versus θb = 65°). Note that the effect of the spreading droplet rebounding 
off the sidewall is also partly cancelled by the hydrophilicity of the side walls. Therefore, the 
image reveals a hollow circle at the cavity center. The area of the hollow circle gradually decreases 
with increasing Vd or D (i.e. droplet mass volume) due to the increased rebounding effect of the 
spreading droplet from the sidewall, as can be seen from Fig.7 along a column from top to bottom 
or along a row from left to right. Within the tested range of Vd and D, the gradually shrinking 
empty circles are eventually closed and the micro-cavities are filled with intact layers of ink film at 
certain critical droplet impact velocities (Vdc) or diameters (Dc). Specifically, Fig.7 shows Vdc = 7.5, 
6.5, 5.5, 5, 3.5 m/s for D = 23.3, 23.6, 23.9, 24.2, 24.5 µm, respectively, and Dc = 24.5, 24.5, 24.5, 
24.2, 23.9, 23.9, 23.6, 23.6, 23.3µm for Vd = 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, respectively.  
 
The time evolution, both top-view and side-view, of PEDOT droplet depositing process, not 
available by the experiment, can be revealed by the complementary computation. The result is 
shown in Fig.8 for three selected Vd with D = 23.3 µm, θs = 50°, θb = 65°, and L/W=1. It should be 
mentioned that the validation test of numerical simulation was previously demonstrated in Liou et 
al. (2009) in terms of the comparison between the experimentally visualized and theoretically 
computed top-view images similar to those depicted in Figs.7-8. In the present work, the computed 
results in terms of other parameters will be validated shortly. Firstly, Fig.8 depicts that upon 
impacting, say at the instant t**=0.001, the deformation and spreading rate of the PEDOT droplet 
increases with its impact velocity Vd. In addition, some explanations of Fig.8 can be made by the 
use of Fig.9 which plots the velocity vector fields at t**=0.010 instant (Figs.9(a)-(b)) and the 
equilibrium film configurations at t**=1.000 (Fig.9(c)) inside the microcavity for D=23.3 µm. For 
Vd=7.5 m/s at t**=0.010, comparing with t**=0.005, the central bulge of the side-view image of 
the depositing film (right side of Fig.8) suggests obvious rebounding movement of the spreading 
droplet from the sidewall. The velocity vectors directed centrally inward around the droplet-air 
interface (solid curve) of Fig.9(b) further support this observation. In contrast, the smaller inertia 
force of Vd=3.5 m/s leads to unnoticeable rebounding effect at the same instant t**=0.010, as 
suggested by the centrally outward pointed velocity vectors around the droplet-air interface 
(Fig.9(a)). As a result, the case of Vd=3.5 m/s, also the case of Vd=5.5 m/s, leaves the bottom wall 
of microcavity an unwetted film hole (Fig.9(c) and Fig.8) whereas the case of Vd=7.5 m/s attains 
an intact film. 
9 
Thus, for a given L/W equations (7) and (8) provide the critical droplet velocity Vdc and diameter 
Dc, respectively. For Vd≧Vdc or D≧Dc the droplet after impact attains an intact film in the 
rectangular microcavity. 
 
In the literature relevant to the droplet inertia and surface tension force, the results are often 
expressed in terms of Weber number We. To compare the present results with the previously 
reported ones, Fig.13 is replotted as Fig.14 by combining Vdc and Dc into We
c
 (=ρVdc2 Dc / σ). It is 
seen that for the tested range of aspect ratio 1≦L/W≦3.30, the present results are in reasonable 
agreement with the reported ones and both show the linear relationship between We
c
 and L/W. 
Note that the variation of We was obtained from simultaneous changes of Vd and D in the 
literature in contrast to from independent change of Vd or D in the present study when the inkjet 
printing was piezo-electrically actuated by the driving waveform. 
5. Conclusions 
For the ranges of parameters examined in the present study, the following key results are obtained 
from complementary micro flow visualizations and numerical simulations: 
 
1. The generation of PEDOT droplets with constant velocities Vd or sizes D by modulating the 
bipolar electric pulse waveform used for driving a piezo-electric inkjet printhead has been 
successfully demonstrated, allowing one to study the independent influence of Vd or D on the 
droplet depositing characteristics in a microcavity. 
 
2. The micro flow visualization of the droplet equilibrium deposition in a square cavity (L/W=1) 
indicates that for a fixed droplet diameter D (or velocity V) there exists a critical droplet velocity 
Vdc (or diameter Dc) at or beyond which the cavity is filled with an intact droplet film. Moreover, 
the complementary numerical simulation reveals the transient deformation of the droplet 
depositing process, such as the initial dome-like shape, the stage of spreading toward and 
rebounding away from the sidewall, and the equilibrium hollowed or intact film, as well as 
provides the corresponding flow dynamic explanations.   
 
3. For 1
 
<L/W≦3.30, starting from low values of D or Vd and until the critical values Dc or Vdc the 
deposited film is first characterized by the crescent-shaped hollows at the two long ends of the 
microcavity followed by the presence of an oval-shaped hollow at the cavity center. As D≧Dc or 
Vd≧Vdc, the oval-shaped hollow is absent and the deposited film becomes intact. These findings of 
critical operating ranges have not been reported previously.  
 
4. Owing to the effect of Vd or D on the droplet deposition in the rectangular microcavity can be 
independently isolated from We in the present experiments, for the first time the linear 
correlations between Vdc and L/W and between Dc and L/W are respectively deduced as: Vdc =

技術說明
(中文) 提供壓電片之控制波形參數，應用於控制噴墨液滴的尺寸及速度。提供壓電片之
控制波形參數，應用於控制噴墨液滴的尺寸及速度。藉由適當調變壓電噴墨頭之
雙極波形的脈衝時間，成功地發展出單獨控制液滴速度 Vd 與液滴特徵直徑 D 
之技術。當固定液滴速度時，隨著液滴特徵直徑增加微凹槽底部之中空圓大小也
跟著變小，這是因為體積越大越容易填滿微凹槽之緣故。當固定液滴特徵直徑時，
隨著液滴速度增加，液滴撞擊微凹槽之側壁後向中心回彈之程度也提高，穩態時
微凹槽底部之中空圓大小跟著變小。Vd 增加至臨界值時，微凹槽可完全被噴覆。
