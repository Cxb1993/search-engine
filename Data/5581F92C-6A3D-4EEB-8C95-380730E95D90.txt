producers. 
Tang and Tang (1994) discussed the general 
screening procedure for product quality. Screening 
is becoming an attractive practice for removing 
non-conforming items. In rectifying inspection 
plan, one needs to do 100% inspection for the 
product of the rejected lot and replace the 
non-conforming items by conforming ones. The 
con-conforming items in the sample of accepted 
lot are replaced by conforming ones. 
In this study, we propose a modified Pulak 
and Al-Sultan’s  (1986) model for determining 
the optimum process mean and the economic 
specification limits under the rectifying inspection 
plan. The single attribute sampling plan is used in 
screening the lot of product, the perfect 
replacement of product is considered in the 
rejected lot and the sample of accepted lot. The 
asymmetric quadratic quality loss function is 
applied in the evaluating the product quality. The 
integrated model can be used for obtaining the 
optimum process control and the inspection policy 
of products. Finally, the numerical example and 
the sensitivity analyses of parameters are provided 
for illustration.  
 
2. Modified Pulak and Al-Sultan’s 
Model  
 
  Assume that the con-conforming items in the 
sample of accepted lot are usually replaced by 
conforming ones. Consider a product with 
both-sided specification limits and normal quality 
characteristic. the asymmetric quadratic quality 
loss function is applied in the evaluating the 
product quality. The expected profit per unit needs 
to subtract the quadratic quality loss of product.     
The conditional expected profit function is
