Abstract
Total hip arthroplasty performed with use
of smaller tissue-preserving techniques received
intense initial popularity and scrutiny.
Advantages of minimal-incision total hip
arthroplasty proposed are reduced cost as a
result of accelerated discharge and reduced
blood loss. One potential complication of
minimal incision total hip arthroplasty is
malpositioning of the components because of
limited visualization. Adaptive remodeling of
bone frequently occurs after the replacement of
a femoral prosthesis for THA. Stress-shielding
has been reported in femurs with cemented and
cementless prostheses. This study is designed to
evaluate if the bone adaptations after
minimal-incision total hip arthroplasty observed
clinically using DEXA could be predicted by a
finite element analysis with bone remodeling
theory. Twenty-nine operations were performed
with the minimal-incision total hip arthroplasty.
For each patient, DEXA images of operated and
healthy femurs were collected postoperatively.
Besides, three dimensional finite element
models of the proximal femur with the
prosthesis are constructed from the Computed
Tomography images of three THR cases. The
remodeling procedure based on strain-adaptive
remodeling theory was utilized to simulate the
bone remodeling postoperatively. The
theoretical prediction was verified by
comparison with the clinical follow-ups. Our
results showed that malpositioning of the
components because of limited visualization
results in different patterns of bone adaptations.
Bone density decreases in proximal trabecular
area in all models after implantation for a long
time. Nevertheless, there occurs asymmetric
deposition of bone in avlgus and varus
implantation. A navigation system hopefully
eliminates the possibility of stem malposition
and enhances advantages of minimal incision
THA for patients.

二、緣由與目的
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) continued to
receive much attention during the past year. The
Finite Element Modeling
Three 3D finite element model of the
proximal femur with the prosthesis were
constructed from the Computed Tomography
(CT) image of three THR cases with the
minimal-incision THA prosthesis (Fig 1). To
simulate the condition during one-legged stance
(Beaupre et al, 1990), the loadings were applied
as distributed forces to the joint surface (2317 N)
and the trochanter (703 N). The lower boundary
that corresponded to the diaphysis was fixed.
For the finite element procedure the COMSOL
3.5a finite element code was used (COMSOL,
Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).

Fig 1. Finite element models of the proximal
femur implanted the prosthesis with various
stem orientations. (A): valgus 4.3°, (B): neutral,
(C): varus 3.4°.
Fig 2. The femur model
implanted a stem with
the neutral orientation.
The implanted
femur with the neutral
orientation was
composed of 3288
nodes and 13088
Tetrahedral Elements
(Fig 2). The relation
between density and
Young’s modulus was
taken from Carter and
Hayes (1977) as
E=37903. The minimal
density was 0.01 g/cm3,
representing complete
resorption of an element.
The maximal density
was taken as 1.74 g/cm3, which corresponds to a
Young’s modulus of almost 20,000MPa. The
Young’s modulus for the implant was assumed
to be 110GPa. The Poisson’s ratio was 0.3.
Since the stem was assumed osseointegrated,
the influence of any residual strains at the
interface due to an initial press-fit was
neglected.
In all simulation analysis, the process starts
with a uniform density distribution of 0.8 g/cm3.
The remodeling procedure was based on
strain-adaptive remodeling theory proposed
previously (Huiskes et al, 1992). The
remodeling signal we adopted was strain energy
density. Referring to literature (Jovanovic &
Jovanovic, 2004), the rate of change of apparent
density was given by:
d/dt=B·(Ui/i-k) 0.01≤≤1.74
B=1 (g/cm3) 2/(MPa*time unit); k=0.6 J/g
The iteration time step was selected to
ensure that the maximum change in apparent
density within the first remodeling increment
was less than half of the maximum density.
Density adaptation was simulated until
remodeling equilibrium was reached, when no
further change in density was observed.
四、結果
DEXA data:
The range of BMD value in all images is
from 0.29 g/cm2 to 3.28 g/cm2 (mean: 1.48
±0.28 g/cm2). The mean BMD values and the
percentage change for all subjects in the
different Gruen zones are compared (Fig. 3).

Considering the factor of stem orientation,
Zone 5 is the most sensitive area to study the
BMD change. With a valgus stem, the BMD
will be decreased from that with a neutral stem.
Oppositely, a varus stem increases the BMD in
Zone 5 and decrease the BMD in zone 3. This
shifting of remodeling zone found in this study
indicates that stem orientation influences the
bone remodeling around distal stem area. Speirs
et al (2007) have studied the influence of
changes in stem position on femoral loading
after THA by finite element simulation. Their
results showed strain energy density varied by
up to 28 % and 24 % in the proximal Gruen
zones 1 and 7 under walking and stair climbing,
respectively. All implanted models with various
stem positions showed characteristic proximal
stress shielding, indicated by a decrease in strain
energy density of up to 5.4 kJ/m3 (69%)
compared to the intact femur. Their study didn’t
include investigation for changes in the
varus-valgus orientation of the stem. This
clinical finding can provide a reference to verify
the following FEA works on the issue related to
stem orientation.
This study has some limitations. Due to
choose the clinical cases randomly, the numbers
of subjects in three groups with different stem
orientation were quite different. The varus group
had three subjects only. In our further study,
more cases varus orientation will be collected to
clarify the finding of this study. Besides,
compared periprosthetic BMD of the THA side
to the value of the healthy side, this study is a
cross-sectional study. Because of a possible
side-related difference in bone mass
preoperatively (Skoldenberg et al, 2006), this
could be a cause of error. A longitudinal study is
needed to verify our information about the
remodeling process in the future.
In conclusion, a long-term follow-up for 29
THA cases with MIS Total Hip was done. The
arthroplasty with a short stem induced bone
remodeling in femur was found in most regions
around the stem. This clinical finding of bone
remodeling after THA was also predicted and
proved by a theoretical simulation of finite
element modeling. The effect of stem
orientation on remodeling of proximal femur
was found to be prominent in our follow-ups
and finite element simulation. That can be an
issue needs to be investigated further.
