Abstract— 
 
In this paper, we study the relay station (RS) placement strategy in IEEE 802.16j WiMAX networks. 
Specifically, the impact of relay station (RS) placement on IEEE 802.16j network performance is analyzed. A 
throughput maximization RS placement problem is mathematically formulated as a binary integer 
programming problem. We prove the NP-hardness of the formulated problem. To find the sub-optimal 
solution to the problem with huge input size, we propose an efficient near-optimal placement solution for 
IEEE 802.16j WiMAX networks. Simulations on the IEEE 802.16j network performance with our RS 
placement strategy are conducted. The throughput performance shows that with the deployment strategy we 
proposed, the IEEE 802.16j network capacity can be tremendously enhanced, especially when hotspots are 
present in the network.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
EEE 802.16 WiMAX is an emerging broadband wireless access technology to the Internet [1-4]. The typical 
IEEE 802.16 network components include base stations (BSs) and subscriber stations (SSs). Within the 
coverage of each WiMAX cell, BS is the central entity that controls the channel usage and allocates resource 
to SSs in both downlink and uplink directions. In WiMAX, adaptive coding and modulation is supported. 
Each SS negotiates its burst profile with the associated BS before the connection is established. Here the burst 
profile refers to the set of coding and modulation settings for the transmission between BS and SS to reflect 
the location-dependent or time-varying link conditions. Different burst profiles lead to different levels of 
robustness and transmission rates. The worse the channel condition (or the farther the link distance), the more

maximize the throughput or connectivity. The work in [1] is among very few that consider placing a given 
number of relay nodes in a multi-rate WLAN cell with uniformly distributed mobile hosts. The authors then 
formulate this problem as an optimization problem and solve it with a Lagrangian-relaxation-based iterative 
algorithm. The results show that an evenly distributed multiple ring structure in the cell is best suited for the 
scenario with mobile stations uniformly distributed in the network. That work, however, assumes that MSs are 
uniformly distributed. In IEEE 802.16j, MSs are free to move and thus hotspots may be formed dynamically. 
This renders an evenly distributed multiple ring structure inappropriate. It is essential to discuss the number 
and the placement of RSs under a non-uniform MS/traffic distribution. Moreover, the network environment in 
[14] consists of homogeneous WiFi relay points. As a result, it is not applicable to IEEE 802.16j WiMAX 
networks in which BS, TRSs and NTRSs are included. 
In this paper, we study the RS placement problem in IEEE 802.16j WiMAX network. We consider 1) the 
resource allocation schemes for a BS to TRSs and to NTRSs, 2) the impact of the location of an intermediate 
RS on the end-to-end transmission time, and 3) the deployment costs of TRSs and NTRSs. The deployment 
cost for RSs is a key network planning issue for operators. More specifically, the deployment cost should not 
exceed the budget determined by operators according to their business considerations. We formulate the RS 
placement problem via an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. The objective of our work is expressed 
as follows. Given an arbitrary distribution of MSs, we would like to determine the number of TRSs and 
NTRSs required and where to deploy them such that the network capacity can be maximized under the 
deployment budget constraint. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and propose a greedy heuristic to 
provide a sub-optimal solution to this problem. We then conduct simulations to verify the effectiveness of the 
proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve excellent throughput gain for 
 6 
In the IEEE 802.16j network, both BS and NTRSs will transmit their own preambles and MAPs to reflect 
their schedules of downstream transmissions. Therefore, BS and NTRSs need to operate on separate 
frequency bands to avoid co-channel interference. On the other hand, TRSs simply forward the messages from 
the associated BS, so they need not transmit their own  MAPs. TRSs thus share the same frequency band 
with the BS. NTRSs may either share the same frequency band among them or have a dedicated frequency 
band for each of them. If NTRSs share the same frequency band, the coverage area for each should not 
overlap so as to avoid interference. Each station is assumed to be equipped with only one antenna. As a result, 
switching between frequency bands is needed if that station (such as an NTRS in this case) has to operate on 
two frequency bands. To simplify the system model, we assume that MSs can access the network by only one 
of the following three schemes: i) connect directly to the BS, ii) connect to the BS via an intermediate TRS, 
and iii) connect to the BS via an intermediate NTRS. Note that we do not consider three or more hops of 
relaying in the following discussion due to practical considerations.  
Under the non-transparent relaying scheme, only BS-NTRS links will occupy the frame time of the BS. 
Suppose that both BS and TRSs operate on frequency f1. The BS needs to sequentially send packets to each 
NTRS and TRS on f1. Whenever no packets are coming to an NTRS from the BS, the NTRS can forward the 
received packets to its downstream MSs on its own frequency band, f2, without interfering with the on-going 
transmissions of the BS to other stations. Clearly, the amount of data that one NTRS can transmit to its 
downstream MSs in a superframe is limited by the portion of the BS frame time allocated to that NTRS. 
Therefore, an NTRS is not able to support too many MSs (i.e., the number of associated MSs for an NTRS is 
bounded by a given constant); otherwise, it will be overloaded and unstable. On the other hand, under the 
transparent relaying scheme, both BS-TRS and TRS-MS transmissions are scheduled by BS on freuquency f1.

maximizing the network throughput is then equivalent to minimizing the total transmission time totalT . 
If an MS is neither connected to a TRS nor an NTRS, it must be directly connected to the BS. Thus,

mass function to indicate the probability that any MS exists in area (i,j), instead of the fixed MS locations. As 
such, the total transmission time can be converted to an expected total transmission time as follows.

The equation above shows that the expected total transmission time consists of two components: the total 
expected transmission time when each MS is directly connected to BS minus the total expected transmission 
time saved from connecting to intermediate RSs. The first term is constant, so the objective that minimizes the 
total expected transmission time is equivalent to maximizing the total expected transmission time saved from 
connecting to RSs.

Note that (11) is identical to (3). We can observe that by applying (10), the objective function of P’ can be 
reduced to |S|*G, where |S| is the number of elements in set S and G is the constant transmission time gain. 
Therefore, |S|*G is the optimal objective function value in this special case, and every feasible solution is the 
optimal solution. Thus, this problem can be discribed as follows: given the candidate RS deployment location 
set B, the MS set S, and coverable MSs of each RS location in B (derived from (11)), we want to find a subset 
of B such that every MS is covered (satisfying (10)) and the total number of RSs will not exceed K. 
Clearly, the special case of the TM-RSP problem, P’, can be reduced from the set cover problem [16], a 
well-known NP-complete problem. The set cover decision problem is discribed as follows. Given a universe 
U, a set V consisting of subsets of U, and a constant L. A set Q is said to cover U if it is a subset of V and the 
set union of its elements is equal to U. The problem is to determine if there exists such a set Q of size L or less 
to cover U.  
Now we introduce the mapping from the set cover problem to the special case of the TM-RSP problem. The 
universe U is mapped to S. Each element in V, i.e., a subset of U, is mapped to a subset of S which represents 
the MSs that a particular RS can cover. The constant L is mapped to K. In this way, every instance of the set 
cover problem can be mapped to an instance of P’ in polynomial time. Moreover, P’ has an optimal solution if 
and only if the set cover problem has a cover. From the discussion above, the special case of the TM-RSP 
 14 
without violating the budget constraint in Step 3. Two decision metrics are considered: the total gain value 
and the gain per unit cost value. To further reduce the deployment cost, in Step 4, we can delete the candidate 
RSs that are too close to the deployed RS. In Step 5, the MSs in the “serving_MS” list of the deployed RS will 
be removed from the “serving_MS” lists of other RSs. Also, the RSs on the chosen location will be removed 
from the available RS list to avoid duplicated deployment. Then we update the deployment budget in Step 6. 
If the remaining budget is not zero, we go back to Step 1, finding the next RS to be deployed, until the 
remaining budget equals zero. The proposed algorithm is summarized in Fig. 3. 
B. Performance Analysis 
Let K be the number of annular sectors in ζ. From our system model, K is a fraction of N. Thus, the number 
of annular sectors in Ω is N－K, which is also the number of candidate RS locations. In the preprocessing 
phase of our algorithm, each candidate TRS and NTRS needs to create its “serving_MS” list, which takes 
O(N
2) time. In Step 1 and Step 5, the “serving_MS” list of every candidate RS must be checked, which also 
takes O(N
2
) time. Other steps in our algorithm takes no more than O(N) time. Since there can at most be

RSs deployed in the network, K is the upper bound of the number of iterations of our greedy 
heuristic. Thus, the time complexity of our algorithm is K(O(N
2
) + O(N)) = O(N
2
). 
Due to the integer nature of the decision variables, the proposed heuristic algorithm may only achieve 
sub-optimality of the original problem. Besides, the very large input size and the integer nature of our problem 
limits the possibility from directly finding the optimal solution with some mathematical tools such as 
MATLAB, Lingo, etc. Consequently, we try to verify the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic by 
calculating the approximation ratio to a relaxed problem P”, in which the binary constraints of the decision

Step 4 in Fig. 3). In the case with the RS distance constraint, the distance between NTRSs is no less than 2r 
and the distance among other RSs (e.g., between a NTRS and a TRS or between TRSs) is no less than r. The 
transmission range of a BS is 15 km and that of an RS is 5 km. The angle of a sector is 15 degrees and the 
width of a ring is 1 km. The capacity limitation of each NTRS is serving at most 25 MSs.  The cost of one 
TRS is 1 unit and the cost of one NTRS is 4 unit. 
The RS placements determined by the two versions of our heuristic for the uniform MS distribution 
scenario are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Comparing Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we observe that NTRSs are always 
preferred if we use the total gain of RSs as our decision metric. On the contrary, TRSs are the better choice if 
we use the gain per unit cost as our decision metric. The effect of the RS distance constraint is also shown in 
both figures. The RS placements with the RS distance constraint tend to spread out across the network while 
those without the RS distance constraint do not.  
For each RS placement determined by our heuristic with two different MS distributions, we also calculate 
the lower bound of the approximation ratio. Fig. 6 depicts that for both MS distributions, the RS placements 
generated by our heuristic can achieve at least 90% of the optimal solution if there is no RS distance 
constraint and the transmission time gain is the only decision metric. This shows that our heuristic can 
efficiently find the near-optimal solution to TM-RSP. If we further consider the RS distance constraint and the 
gain per unit cost as our decision metric, the lower bound of the approximation ratio will decrease, which 
means that the objective value of the heuristic solution will possibly be farther (i.e., smaller) from that of the 
optimal solution. Nevertheless, in most cases, the approximation ratios are no worse than 65%. Despite the 
fact that adding the RS distance constraints may reduce the network aggregate transmission time gain, it could 
 18 
further reduce the deployment cost while the throughput gain is still almost as high as that without the 
constraint. 
Note that only deploying TRSs may not increase the total network throughput. Due to the coverage 
extension by TRSs, some MSs far from the BS can still enter the network and contend for the resource of the 
BS with MSs closer to the BS. The fact that the network has to accommodate more low-rate MSs makes the 
total network throughput lower than that when only high-rate MSs are present.  
VI.  CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the impact of relay station placement on the network performance in the IEEE 802.16j 
network is studied. Specifically, the throughput maximization relay station placement problem is 
mathematically formulated and its complexity is analyzed. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to 
determine the number and locations of relay station deployment, with a given MS distribution and deployment 
budget. The simulation results show the different impacts of deploying TRSs and NTRSs on the performance 
of the IEEE 802.16j network. Moreover, we verify that by properly planning the RS placements, the capacity 
of IEEE 802.16j networks can be greatly extended by RSs, especially when hotspots are present.
