NSC-96-2221-E-182-047- 6  A1 
this report we have studied on: (1) High-k HfAlO multilayer nanocrystal memory devices have been 
investigated. It is very interesting that HfAlO nanocrystals are formed from HfO2/Al2O3 nanolaminate 
layers after high temperature annealing treatment. (2) RuOx metal nanocrystal memory devices have 
been also developed and investigated. All films were deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The 
physical and memory characteristics have been investigated. (3) A small IrOx nanocrystal memory 
device has been investigated. All films have been deposited by sputtering. The physical and memory 
characteristics have been investigated. (4) The high-k HfO2/TiO2 multilayers or single layer quantum 
wells have been investigated. All films have been deposited by ALD. This memory structure is very 
interesting and we will discuss later.  
         
         2. Atomic layer deposited high-k multilayer nanocrystal memory devices 
     2.1 Experiment 
      The p-type Si (100) substrates with resistivity of 15-25 W-cm were cleaned by standard Radio 
Corporation of America (RCA) method and the surface oxide was removed by using a dilute HF (1%) 
solution. After cleaning the Si substrate, a high quality tunneling oxide (SiO2) with a thickness of 3 nm 
was grown by rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) process at 1000oC for 20s.  Then, the high-k HfO2/Al2O3 
nano-mixtures with a thickness ratio of 1:1 (HfO2:Al2O3) was deposited by ALD at a substrate 
temperature of 300oC. The thickness of HfO2/Al2O3 nanomixtures was ~ 8 nm. High-k Al2O3 blocking 
oxide with a thickness of 12 nm was deposited in-situ on the high-k HfO2/Al2O3 nano-mixtures. Each 
layer thickness of HfO2 or Al2O3 film was described in detail below. One cycle of Al2O3 layer means 
one cycle of tri-methyl-aluminum [Al(CH3)3] plus one cycle of H2O. The thickness of Al2O3 layer for 
each cycle is ~0.1 nm. One cycle of HfO2 layer means one cycle of hafnium tetra-chloride (HfCl4) plus

The high-k HfO2/Al2O3 layer-by-layer is also observed clearly by the high angle annular dark field 
scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) image for the as-deposited sample [Fig. 
2(b)]. After the PDA treatment, the high-k HfO2/Al2O3 nanolaminate layers have been mixed together 
and form the Hf-rich HfAlO nanocrystals embedded in Al-rich HfAlO films [Fig. 2(c)]. The 
thicknesses of SiO2, HfAlO and Al2O3 films are found to be ~3 nm, ~9 nm and ~10 nm, respectively. 
Due to the crystallization and similar contrast of the high-k HfAlO films, it is difficult to observe the 
isolated nanocrystals by cross-sectional TEM image. It is expected that the Hf-rich HfAlO nanocrystals 
embedded in Al-rich HfAlO films could be observed. Ng et al. [13] reported the high-density Si 
nanocrystal by considering the different crystal orientations. The high-k Hf-rich HfAlO nanocrystals 
embedded in the Al-rich HfAlO films are clearly observed by plan view TEM image in a p-
Si/SiO2/HfAlO/Al2O3 structure as shown in Fig. 2(d). A single nanocrystal is shown in Fig. 2(e). A 
small diameter and a high density of the high-k HfAlO nanocrystals are found to be <10 nm and >5 x 
1011/cm2, respectively. Note that the high-k HfAlO nanocrystals in the pure HfAlO mixture [14] with a 
thickness of ~10 nm or HfO2(~2 nm)/Al2O3(~2 nm) nanolaminate layers [15] with the three periods 
have not been observed after annealing treatment of 900oC for 1 min (not shown here). So, it is 
believed that the high-k HfAlO nanocrystals have been observed in this study, due to the design of 
HfO2(1.2 nm)/Al2O3(0.8 nm) nanolaminate structure. 
 
   2.2.2 X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) characteristics 
     The high-k HfAlO nanocrystals have been also confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS) measurement. Fig. 3(a) shows the XP spectrum of Hf4f signal for the as-deposited memory 
capacitors. The peak fitting is performed by Shirley background subtraction and Gaussian/Lorentzian

      After the annealing treatment, the peak binding energies of the Hf4f7/2 electron centered at 17.3 eV 
and the Hf4f5/2 electron centered at 19 eV are shifted towards the higher binding energies which are 
attributed to the Hf-Al-O bonding [Fig. 3(b)]. The peak separation energies between the Hf4f7/2 and

curve (i.e., no charging up or discharging the high-k HfAlO nanocrystal memory capacitor) has been 
obtained with the application of a small sweeping gate voltage of Vg = ± 3 V. The quasi-neutral flat-

band offset of HfAlO nanocrystals with respect to conduction band offset (DEc » 2.8 eV) of Al2O3 films 
and the smaller CET (8.5±0.5 nm versus 10±0.5 nm) [Fig. 5 (c)]. Due to the same reason, the 
breakdown voltage of high-k HfAlO memory capacitor is smaller than that of pure Al2O3 charge 
trapping layer (-22.5 V versus -24.8 V). The leakage current of the annealed HfAlO nanocrystal 
memory capacitor is higher as compared with as-deposited HfAlO memory capacitor, due to 
crystallization of the stack high-k layers. A large current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis memory 
window of the HfAlO memory capacitor is found to be DV » 16 V [Fig. 5(d)]. The step voltage and 
delay time were 1 V and 1s, respectively during J-V measurement. The first cycle of J-V curve was 0V 
® 16V ® -16V ® 16V. The second cycle of I-V curve was 16V ® -16V ® 16V. The J-V hysteresis 
memory window is also found to be DV » 16 V after 104 cycles. It means that a good endurance of 
HfAlO memory capacitor is observed, due to the high quality film formation by both the tunneling 
oxide and high-k HfAlO nanocrystals.  
 
   2.2.4 Endurance, retention and charge loss 
         Fig. 6(a) shows the endurance characteristics of the high-k HfAlO multilayer nanocrystals. The 
programming voltage was +16V with a pulse width of 1s and the erasing voltage was -16 V with a 
pulse width of 1s. The initial memory window is ~10 V and it is ~9.8 V after 104 cycles. The retention 
characteristics of the high-k HfAlO nanocrystal memory capacitors have been shown in Fig. 6(b). The 
initial memory window is ~10 V and it can be retained ~8 V after 105 s of retention, which is better 
than the pure HfO2 charge trapping layers [22]. An energy band diagram at retention mode is shown the 
inset of Fig. 6(b). A low charge loss of ~20% has been observed after 105 s of retention, due to nano-
confinement into the high-k HfAlO multilayer nanocrystals.

device. To erase fully, a minimum negative voltage of -8 V needs to be adjusted to bring the C-V curve 
at the neutral C-V position (or VFBN position). The VFB is also shifted towards positive axis with 
increasing the sweeping voltage up to +15 V. The negative voltage of -8V is also enough to bring back 
C-V in the neutral position. The erase mechanism is believed that the hole will be injected from the Si 
substrate to the HfO2 nanocrystals for compensating the electron storage under erase operation. It 
suggests that the electron is easy to store than erase. The VFB can be shifted towards negative axis with 
increasing the negative voltage on the gate. The hysteresis memory window of DV>8 V is observed 
under the sweeping gate voltage of ±15V [14] In this study, the electron storage in the HfO2 
nanocrystals has been investigated. So, the applying voltages have been adjusted to control the electron 
storage and erasing, and we did not apply more negative voltage to see the flat-band voltage shift 
towards the negative axis than that of the VFBN. This is the reason for applying asymmetrical sweeping 
voltage. The memory window increases significantly with increasing the sweeping gate voltage, which 
implies that the electron can be stored in the high-k HfO2 nanocrystals. It is also corroborating with the 
TEM and XPS characteristics [Figs. 7-9]. The memory window of DV~1.2 V is observed at a small 
sweeping gate voltage of +5 V/-8 V. It means that the high-k HfO2 nanocrystal memory capacitor can 
be operated below 8 V. For comparison, there is no hysteresis memory window of the p-
Si/SiO2(3nm)/Al2O3 (20 nm)/Pt capacitor with the operation voltage of below 8 V [14]. It means that 
the high-k HfO2 nanocrystal memory capacitor can be operated for low voltage operation than that of 
the memory capacitor without HfO2 nanocrystal. It is noted that the capacitance density of annealed 
capacitor at accumulation region (~4.3x10-7F/cm2) is higher as compared to that of the as-deposited 
one (~2.5x10-7F/cm2), due to the high-k HfO2 nanocrystal formation. It means that the dielectric 
permittivity of the high-k HfO2 nanocrystal capacitor is higher than that of the as-deposited high-k

2.3.4 Retention characteristics at 85oC 
          The retention characteristics of the high-k HfO2 nanocrystal memory capacitors is shown in Fig. 
11.  A good memory window of DV»0.9V is observed after 104 s of retention with a small 
programming voltage of +5V and a measurement temperature of 85oC. A small charge loss of ~25% 
after 104 s of retention is observed due to the charge confinement in the layer-by-layer of high-k HfO2 
nanocrystals. 
          
         3. Atomic layer deposited RuOx metal nanocrystal memory devices 
     3.1 Experiment 
           The n-type Si (100) substrate with a doping of >1x1017/cm3 was used as a starting wafer. The Si 
wafers were cleaned by the standard Radio Corporation of America (RCA) process. Then the Si wafers 
were dipped in dilute HF solution to remove the native oxide from the surface. A tunneling oxide 
(SiO2) with a thickness of 3 nm was grown by rapid thermal oxide (RTO) process at a substrate 
temperature of 1000oC for 15s. A thin high-k HfO2 film with a thickness of 2 nm was deposited by 
ALD. Then ruthenium (Ru) films with the thicknesses of 0.5 nm, 1 nm and 2 nm were deposited by 
plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). As an oxidant gas, dry oxygen is used in the ALD 
system. It is noted that the RuOx film can not be deposited directly on SiO2 or Al2O3 surface. So, the 
high-k HfO2 film was used as a wetting layer for the deposition of RuOx film. Furthermore, this high-k 
HfO2 film can be used as a part of tunneling oxide which can improve the memory device 
performance. The physical thickness of tunneling oxide (SiO2+HfO2) as stack dielectric is ~5 nm for 
the as-deposited structure. Then a thick high-k Al2O3 film as a blocking oxide was deposited by ALD. 
The thickness of Al2O3 film was 20 nm. All films were deposited by ALD/PEALD cluster tools. To

show amorphous. Due to a small thickness (~1 nm) of amorphous RuOx film and almost the same 
contrast with HfO2 film, an interface between the RuOx and HfO2 film is not observed clearly. After the 
memory capacitor fabrication, both high-k HfO2 and RuOx layers show crystalline while the Al2O3 film 
shows partiall crystalline. Due to the crystallization of both the HfO2 film and RuOx nanocrystal, the 
interface between the high-k HfO2 and RuOx layers is observed clearly. The thickness of HfO2 and 
Al2O3 films has been reduced to ~1 and 17 nm, respectively [Fig. 13(b)]. Total physical thickness of 
the stack tunneling oxide (SiO2+HfO2) is larger than 4 nm which can also improve the charge storage 
characteristics. The high-k HfO2 layer acts as a wetting layer for RuOx film deposition but it can be 
also used as a part of tunneling oxide. Without HfO2 layer, it is not possible to deposit RuOx nano-layer 
directly on SiO2 or Al2O3 film by our ALD system and the reason is not clear. After the annealing 
treatment, an isolated RuOx nanocrystal embedded in HfO2 and Al2O3 films has been observed clearly. 
An average thickness of RuOx metal nanocrystal is found to be ~3 nm, respectively. 
          Fig. 14(a) shows the cross-sectional HRTEM image of the memory capacitor at the annealing 
temperature of 850oC. For the as-deposited memory structure the thicknesses of the SiO2, HfO2, RuOx, 
and Al2O3 layers were 3 nm, 2 nm, 2 nm and 20 nm, respectively (not shown here). After annealing at 
850oC, the thicknesses are found to be 3.5 nm, 1 nm, 3nm and 17 nm, respectively. The diameter and 
thickness of RuOx nanocrystals are found to be 5-10 nm and > 3 nm, respectively.  Total physical 
thickness of tunneling oxide (SiO2+HfO2) is > 4.0 nm. An isolated RuOx nanocrystal with diameter of 
8-15 nm and thickness of > 4 nm can be observed after PDA at 1000oC [Fig. 14(b)]. The nanocrystal is 
like a thick disk. The tunneling oxide (SiO2+HfO2) thickness at 1000oC is > 5.0 nm. The thickness of 
the tunneling oxide layer increases slightly with the increasing of the annealing temperature, which can 
improve the retention characteristics of the memory capacitor. The TEM image of a single RuOx 
nanocrystal at different annealing temperatures of 850oC, 900oC, 950oC and 1000oC are shown in Figs.

        Fig. 15 shows a plan-view TEM image of the isolated RuOx metal nanocrystals in the n-
Si/SiO2/HfO2/RuOx/Al2O3/Pt memory structure. A high density of the RuOx metal nanocrystals with an 
average diameter of 7 nm is found to be ~ 1.6×1012/cm2 at 850oC (Fig. 16). Whereas at the annealing 
temperature of 1000oC, the density of the RuOx metal nanocrystal is ~ 5x1011/cm2 and the diameter is ~ 
13nm. It is clear that the density of the RuOx metal nanocrystal decreases (slightly) with increasing of 
the annealing temperatures but still the high density of the nanocrystals can be observed at the high 
annealing temperatures, which can be useful for nanoscale nonvolatile memory device applications. It 
means that the thermal stability is very good for the RuOx nanocrystal. The density and size of RuOx 
nanocrystals can be also controlled mostly by changing the thickness of RuOx nano-layer. The RuOx

temperature annealing process but the thickness of HfO2 film is reduced to ~1 nm only. Furthermore, 
the peak binding energies of Al2p and O1s electrons are found to be 74.5 eV and 532.2 eV, 
respectively, due to Al-O bonding in the Al2O3 films as shown in Fig. 19. It is confirmed that the pure 
RuOx metal nanocrystals composed with RuO2 and RuO3 can be formed in the n-
Si/SiO2/HfO2/RuOx/Al2O3/Pt memory capacitors. Due to the formation of isolated RuOx metal 
nanocrystals, the memory performances are also improved which have been discussed below. 
 
3.3 Memory characteristics  
   3.3.1 C-V hysteresis curves and cumulative probability 
              Fig. 20 (a) shows excellent clock-wise C-V hysteresis characteristics of the RuOx metal 
nanocrystal memory capacitors with different sweeping gate voltages. The C-V measurement 
frequency was 1 MHz. The holding (or delay) time was 0.1s during C-V measurement. A neutral flat-
band voltage (VFBN) is +0.1V under the sweeping voltages (Vg) of +0.5V ® -0.5V and -0.5V ® +0.5V, 
where no hysteresis memory window is observed as shown in Fig. 20(b). There is a small memory 
window of DV»0.3V at the small sweeping gate voltages of +1V ® -1V and -1V ® +1V. A significant 
hysteresis memory window of DV»5.2V is also observed at the small sweeping gate voltages of +5V 
® -5V and -5V ® +5V. The hysteresis memory window is gradually increased with increasing the 
sweeping gate voltages and it is becoming saturated beyond the sweeping gate voltage of 7V. A large 
hysteresis memory window of DV»12.2V is obtained at the sweeping gate voltages of +10V ® -10V 
and -10V ® +10V. The electrons can be stored in the RuOx metal nanocrystals under the positive gate 
voltages and the holes can be stored under the negative gate voltages. It is interesting to note that a 
plateau is observed under a sweeping voltage of -10V ® +10V and it may be the holes storage in the

           The charge (electrons or holes storage) density can be calculated by using this equation (1). 
Where the ∆VFB (=VFB-VFBN) is 4.6 V for the electrons and 7.6 V for the holes under a positive gate 
voltage of 10 V. Using equation (1), the electrons storage density of ~1.15x1013 cm-2 and the holes 
storage density of ~1.9x1013 cm-2 are observed. It indicates that one RuOx metal nanocrystal can store 
about eight electrons and thirteen holes. It is encouraged us that the atomic layer deposited RuOx metal 
nanocrystals have high charge storage capability due to the many available energy levels in the RuOx 
nanocrystals. A small equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 8.6 ±0.5 nm with highly reproducible is 
observed which can be useful in future nanoscale nonvolatile memory device applications. The 
nanoscrystal devices with highly uniform and reproducible are the challenging issues for nonvolatile 
memory applications.

the cumulative probability versus hysteresis memory window under a small sweeping gate voltage 
operation of +5 V ® -5V and -5V ® +5V. Under the same condition, the memory capacitors have been 
produced for at least three times. Twenty one memory capacitors were measured at different positions 
on the same wafer. The large memory windows of DV»1 V to 2 V for RuOx=0.5 nm, DV»4.3 V to 5.2 
V for RuOx=1 nm and DV»7 V to 8 V for RuOx=2 nm with tightly distributed have been observed for 
our promising memory device under a small gate voltage of ±5 V. It means that the RuOx nanocrystal 
memory capacitors show highly uniform and reproducible. The memory window can be decreased with 
decreasing the thickness of RuOx layer and it may be due to small size and density of RuOx 
nanocrystals. Low voltage operation of our memory device can be explained as follows.

where the tox, tHfO2, tRuOx, and tAl2O3 are the thicknesses of the SiO2, HfO2, RuOx and Al2O3 layers. A 
relative permittivity of the RuOx nanocrystals can be estimated by using the series capacitance model at 
the accumulation region (Vg » +10V) as follows.  
 
 
 
Where eo (=8.85x10-14 F/cm) is the free space permittivity. The capacitance density of Cox~4x10-7 
F/cm2 is observed at the accumulation region. The relative permittivities of the SiO2, HfO2, and Al2O3 
layers are found to be 3.9, 17, and 13, respectively. The values of tox, tHfO2, tRuOx, and tAl2O3 are 3, 1, 3, 
and 17 nm, respectively. Using above those values in equation (7), the relative permittivity of RuOx 
nanocrystals is estimated to be 40. Using above all values in the equations (5) and (6) at a gate voltage 
of Vg =+10V, the voltages for the SiO2 , HfO2 tunneling and Al2O3 blocking oxides are found to be 3.3 
V (Vox), 0.25 V (VHfO2) and 5.61 V (VAl2O3), respectively, while the corresponding electric fields are 
found to be 11 MV/cm (Eox), 2.52 MV/cm (EHfO2) and 3.3 MV/cm (EAl2O3).  It is noted that the electric 
field across the Al2O3 layer is much smaller than the electric field across the SiO2 layer. The electric 
field across the SiO2 layer is more than 10 MV/cm which is indicating the Fowler-Nordheim (F-N)

the electrons can be returned back to the Si conduction layer from the RuOx nanocrystal or the holes 
can be stored in the RuOx nanocrysatls. After positive gate voltage on the memory capacitor, the 
electrons can be stored for a long time in the RuOx metal nanocrystals, due to the deep level traps 
[Fermi level energy (Ef) of RuOx- electron effinity of Si conduction layer = 4.8 eV - 4.1 eV = 0.7 eV]. 
Furthermore, the high work function Pt metal gate (fm»5.2 eV) will increase the barrier height between 
Al2O3 blocking oxide and metal gate which will reduce the electron back tunneling current from the 
metal gate to the ruthenium oxide nanocrystal through the blocking oxide. Due to the thick tunneling 
oxide (SiO2+HfO2) along with high-k dielectric tunneling barriers and deep level traps, the three 
dimensional (3D) confinements of charges could be observed (Fig. 24) which has been also confirmed 
from the retention measurement.

   3.3.3 Program/erase characteristics 
             Fig. 24 shows memory window versus program/erase time. A large memory window of DVFB » 
7.6V under small program/erase voltage of 5V@ 0.1s is observed due to high-k films in tunneling and 
blocking oxide. The program/erase speed of memory device at a PDA 1000oC is slower (slightly), due 
to both of thick tunneling oxide (>5nm) and low density of nanocrystals. Both program and erase 
speeds of DVFB>1V@100ms can be obtained under modified Fowler-Nordheim carrier injections. The 
program/erase speed at a small gate voltage is improved due to high-κ Al2O3 blocking oxide. The 
electric field across the tunneling oxide (CET~3.2 nm) is higher and the electric field across the 
blocking oxide is negligible, due to the thick (~20 nm) high-k Al2O3 (e~10) blocking oxide (Fig. 25).

        4. IrOx metal nanocrystal memory devices with IrOx metal gate 
     4.1 Experiment 
          At first the n-type Si (100) substrate with a resistivity of 1 W-cm was cleaned by the RCA 
process to remove native oxide from the surface of the substrate. After the cleaning of the n-type Si 
substrate, a 2 nm thick silicon di-oxide (SiO2) was grown by annealing at 850°C for 5 s. A ~ 2 nm-thick 
high-k Al2O3 film as a tunneling oxide layer was grown by RF-sputtering. Then, the Iridium oxide 
(IrOx) layer with the thickness of 1 nm and 2 nm were grown by RF-sputtering. After the deposition of 
the IrOx nanolayer, the high-k Al2O3 film (~ 5 nm-thick) as a blocking oxide was grown by RF-
sputtering system. To form the IrOx nanocrystals from the IrOx nanolayer, a post-deposition annealing 
(PDA) treatment with a temperature of 700oC for 1 min in N2 ambient was performed. Finally the top 
IrOx metal gate electrode (gate area : 4.9×10-4 cm2) was deposited by RF-sputtering system. A 
schematic structure of novel IrOx metal nanocrystal memory device in an n-
Si/SiO2/Al2O3/IrOx/Al2O3/IrOx structure is shown in Fig. 28.

Si/SiO2/Al2O3/IrOx(2nm)/Al2O3/ IrOx memory structure [Figs. 29 (b) & (c)]. The diameter, thickness, 
and density of IrOx nanocrystals are found to be <3 nm, <2 nm and >8.2×1012/cm2, respectively, for 
IrOx (1 nm) [Fig. 29(c)], while those values are found to be <5 nm, <3 nm, and >4×1012/cm2, 
respectively, for IrOx (2 nm) [Fig. 29(d)]. The isolated nanocrystals are like a thick disk. It means that 
the size and density of the IrOx nanocrystal can be controlled by IrOx nano layer thickness.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           The average elemental compositions of oxygen (O), silicon (Si), aluminum (Al) and iridium (Ir) 
in the n-Si/SiO2/Al2O3/IrOx/Al2O3/IrOx memory structure were investigated by energy dispersive x-ray 
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 30). A layer-by-layer structure is observed from the EDS 
measurement. The IrOx nanocrystals are confirmed by XPS measurement. Fig. 31 (a) shows the Ir 4f 
core level spectrum. The binding energy peaks are due to the Ir2O3 4d5/2 and Ir2O3 4d7/2 spin orbit 
doublets. Ir2O3 4d5/2 shows the binding energy peak ~ 64.8 eV and Ir2O3 4d7/2 shows the binding energy

    4.4 Retention characteristics 
         Fig. 33(a) shows the retention characteristics of the 1 nm thick IrOx nanolayer memory devices. 
The memory window of DV» 0.5V and charge loss of 70% are observed after 10 years of retention. 
Excellent retention characteristics have been observed for the 2 nm thick IrOx nanolayer memory 
devices [Fig. 33(b)] and it may be due to the larger size of the IrOx nanocrystals. The large memory 
window of DV» 0.7V is observed after 10 years of retention. A negligible charge loss of ~22% is 
observed under the small program/erase voltage of 4V, 0.2s, due to strong confinement of charges in 
the IrOx nanocrystals.  
 
         5. High-k HfO2/TiO2/HfO2 multilayer quantum well memory devices 
     5.1 Experiment 
            A p-type Si (100) substrate with a resistivity of ~1W-cm was cleaned by dipping in dilute HF 
solution for 1min using the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) process. After cleaning the p-Si 
substrate, the tunneling oxide with the thickness of 3-4 nm was grown by rapid thermal process in 
oxidation at 1000oC for 20s-60s. The high-k HfO2 films with a thickness of 0.5 nm for each layer were 
deposited by ALD. The high-k TiO2 films with a thickness of 0.5 nm for each layer were deposited by 
plasma-enhanced ALD. Then, the 9-nm thick SiO2 as a blocking oxide at 350oC was deposited by 
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on HfO2 (0.5nm)/TiO2 (0.5nm) multilayers with 3-7 
quantum wells (QWs). A poly-Si gate electrode (~200 nm-thick) was deposited on memory structures. 
Source, drain and poly-Si gate were implanted by phosphorus. The implantation energy and dose were 
15 keV and 1x1015/cm2, respectively. All memory transistors (WxL=20 mm x 20 mm) have post-
deposition annealing (PDA) treatment at 900oC for 1min in the N2 ambient. The post metal annealing

and it is also supported by line scan (red line). It means that there is no diffusion between HfO2 and

have been drawn in Fig. 40, under the program and erase conditions. Electrons can be easily stored in 
the HfO2/TiO2/HfO2 multilayer quantum wells from the Si conduction layer (2DEG: two dimensional 
electron gas) under a small program voltage [Fig. 40(a)] because of very small conduction band offsets 
of DEc~1.7 eV for the HfO2 film and DEc~0.9 eV for the TiO2 film. Under erase condition [Fig. 40(b)], 
the stored electrons will come back from those multilayer quantum wells through the HfO2 barrier layer 
to the Si conduction layer under a small erase voltage.

      5.2.6 Endurance and retention characteristics 
            Fig. 41 shows the endurance characteristics of our memory transistor with 7 quantum wells. 
The memory device can have endurance more than 104 cycles. Due to the limitation of our 
measurement system, the endurance up to 104 cycles is performed. Fig. 42 shows the retention 
characteristics of the memory transistor. The initial programming and erasing states by channel hot 
electron and hot holes have been used Vg/Vd= 8V/8V for 100 ms pulse width and Vg/Vd= -8V/8V for 
100 ms pulse width, respectively. An initial memory window of DVt~6.1V and it is retained DVt~5.5V 
at 20oC and DVt~4.3V at 85oC after 10 years of retention. The charge loss is ~10% at 20oC and ~30% 
at 85oC after 10 years of retention. The large memory window (DVt>4 V) and low charge loss of MQW 
devices are observed due to the charge confinement in the quantum wells.

quantum well (TiO2) and blocking oxide (Al2O3) are found to be ~9 and ~10 nm, respectively. The 
high-k HfO2 and TiO2 films show fully polycrystalline while the Al2O3 film shows partial crystalline. 
An excellent interface between the high-k HfO2 and TiO2 films is observed and there is no interaction 
or intermixing between HfO2 and TiO2 films after PDA treatment by observed by x-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy. The high-k HfO2/TiO2/HfO2 multilayer quantum wells are clearly observed by HRTEM 
image [Fig. 44(a)]. After the PDA treatment, the HfO2/TiO2 films are crystalline with maintaining the 
layer-by-layer structure. Even though it is crystalline, the layer-by-layer structure is also observed by 
HRTEM image with an elemental line profile (red color) plotted by Gatan "DIGITAL 
MICROGRAPH" [Fig. 44(b)], indicating that there is no inter-diffusion between the HfO2 and TiO2 
layers after high temperature annealing process. So, the high-k HfO2/TiO2 layers can be treated as a 
new material system which can make a quantum well memory structure. 
 
5.3.2 C-V hysteresis of a single and multilayer quantum wells 
             Fig. 45(a) shows a well behaved counter-clockwise C-V (1 MHz) hysteresis with different 
sweeping gate voltages (Vg). A hysteresis memory window of DV »1.6 V at a low sweeping gate 
voltage of Vg » ±2 V is observed for the high-k HfO2/TiO2/Al2O3 quantum well memory devices due to 
the charge confinement in the quantum well. A holding time was 100 ms during the C-V measurement. 
A memory window of DV » 0.5 V at a low gate voltage operation of Vg » ±1 V is also observed, 
indicating that the quantum well memory devices can be useful for low gate voltage operation of 
nanoscale flash memory device applications. The hysteresis memory window of quantum well devices 
increases with increasing the gate voltage up to Vg » ±2 V. To get at least ~1 V hysteresis memory 
window, a gate voltage of Vg>5 V is necessary for the pure HfO2 charge trapping layers in the p-

          The hysteresis memory windows of DV » 4 V for the pure HfO2 and DV » 1.2 V for the pure 
Al2O3 charge trapping layers have been observed due to the charge trapping in the high-k films [Fig. 
45(b)].  Note that there is no hysteresis memory window of the pure TiO2 charge trapping layers in the 
p-Si/SiO2 (3 nm)/TiO2 (10 nm)/Al2O3 (15 nm)/Pt memory capacitor up to a gate voltage of Vg » ±10 V. 
The capacitance density of the quantum well capacitor is very high (~4.7 fF/mm2), due to high-k Al2O3 
(kAl2O3~10) as a tunneling and blocking oxides, high-k HfO2 (kHFO2~17), and high-k TiO2 (kTiO2~20) 
layers. The capacitance equivalent thickness (CET) of the quantum well memory capacitor is found to 
be ~7.5 nm. According to the ITRS roadmap, a thin CET of ~10 nm is necessary in future scaled 
SONOS flash memory device applications.

well. Due to significant memory window with a low gate voltage of 2V and a low charge loss of 3% of 
the quantum well memory devices, it can be used in future multi-level charge (MLC) storage flash 
memory applications.  
 
       6. Conclusions 
     The enhancement of memory device characteristics in ALD high-k HfAlO nanocrystal or HfO2 
nanocrystal by phase separation method has been investigated. The high-k HfAlO nanocrystal 
multilayers are confirmed by HRTEM and XPS measurements. The high-k HfAlO nanocrystal 
multilayer memory devices with a small EOT of 9.0 nm have a good endurance of 104 cycles and a 
large memory window of 8 V after 105 s of retention at a program/erase voltage of +/-16V, 1s. The 
operation voltage and EOT can be decreased by using a single layer of high-k HfAlO nanocrystal 
memory device. The high-k ALD HfO2 nanocrystal memory devices show a large memory window of 
4.2 V, moderate density of 1x1011/cm2, small size of 5–10 nm, and high charge density of 
1.1x1013/cm2. The high-k HfO2 nanocrystal memory device with a memory window of 0.9 V at a small 
programming voltage of +5 V, 1s after 104 s of retention at 85oC can be used for a <45 nm technology 
node. 
Highly thermally stable and reproducible RuOx metal nanocrystal (average diameter~10 nm) 
memory devices with a large memory window (>10V) and excellent endurance (104 cycles) 
characteristics have been reported. The memory devices with a small EOT of <10 nm can be operated 
under a small gate voltage (Vg<5V, 0.1s). The memory window of 4.9V at 20oC and 4.4 at 85oC under 
a small program/erase voltage of 5V@0.1s is observed after 10 years of retention with a negligible 
charge loss, and it can be applied beyond 45 nm technology node.

device performance is better and it is due to the novel high-k quantum well and nanocrystal design. It

system has been manufactured using ormanic transistors and MEMS switches. The 
position of electronic objects on this sheet can be contactless sensed by 
electromagnetic coupling using an organic transistor active matrix. Then, power is 
selectively fed to the objects by an electromagnetic field using a two-dimentional 
array of copper coils that are driven by a printed plastic switching matrix. The 
effective power transmission area is 21 x 21 cm2. Due to selective power transmission, 
they have achieved a coupling efficiency of power transmission of 81.4%, and a 
power of 40W was wirelessly received. The thickness and weight of the entire sheet 
are 1 mm and 50g, respectively. It is expected that it has very good opportunity for 
commercialized. 
        Hisatune Watanabe, Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies, Inc., Japan 
was presented the topic entitled “Try Disruptive Technology”. He focused the 
opportunity of funding in Japan for advanced research and development. He was 
presented the outcomes the new technology which can be useful for mankind. 
  
96/09/19   Area 4: Advanced Memory Technology (J-1: DRAM I and J-2: Flash 
memory I) 
      T. Shino presented (invited talk) a single transistor DRAM cell, which is 
generally called Floating Body Cell (FBC) and it makes use of its floating body 
formed on an SOI as a data storage node. One of the growing interests is its scalability 
to the future generations. Scalability of an FBC estimated by device simulation and 
experimental results are demonstrated with emphasis on challenging issues. 
Combining unique features of the FBCs with design methodology of the conventional 
memory devices, the answers to the challenging issues can be found. C. Lee reported 
the U-RCAT (U-shaped-Recess-Channel-Array Transistor) technology which has 
been developed in a 1Gb density DRAM with 60nm feature size and beyond. The 
U-RCAT shows superior characteristics such as sub-threshold swing (SW), gate 
induced drain leakage (GIDL), operating current, DIBL, junction leakage current, data 
retention time, and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) stress immunities compared with the 
S-RCAT (Sphere-shaped--Recess-Channel-Array Transistor) structure due to the 
relaxed E-field intensity from the smooth and enlarged neck curvature. M. Yoshida 
reported that an RC-FinFET (Recessed Channel FinFET) cell transistor has been 
successfully integrated in DRAM. An RC-FinFET has better SCE immunity and can 
be optimized to have lower GIDL relative to a conventional LD-FinFET. This fact 
leads an RC-FinFET has about 55% longer static retention time than an LD-FinFET. 
The body bias dependency of GIDL current in the body-tied finFET was reported by 
C. Lee.  The gate induced drain leakage (GIDL) current depends not only on the 
vertical electric field but also on the lateral electric field. S. G. Park reported that the 
radical oxidation in S-RCAT structure improves the reliability and electrical 
characteristics, compared with conventional wet oxidation. These improvements can 
be explained by the effects of uniform oxide thickness inside the ball and rounded 
investigate the charge location in the SONOS memory devices.  
The short poster presentations included high-performance flash memory and 
DRAM have been discussed. The novel carbon nanotubes have been also presented. 
Nanoscale channel length device fabrication is also explained. It was very good poster 
session.  
Y. Matsui (invited talk: Hitachi) reported the phase change memory (PCM). The 
PCM is attracting increasing interest as a candidate for embedded and stand-alone 
applications. Research in the last few years has focused on the important issues 
involved in its practical application. As these issues are nearing a solution, the PCM 
will soon enter a rapidly growing market. A. Sakai reported a 3D electro-thermal 
compact model for a PCM cell. The validity of the model was confirmed by leading a 
good agreement to the measurement. In addition, it was pointed out that the 
fluctuation of the plug radius would become one of the key issues to limit the scaling 
of PCM. D. S. Chao presented the HSPICE model which can accurately simulate the 
programming behaviors of PCM cell. The simulation results show that this model can 
display analogous static characteristics and transient behaviors to the experimental 
results. Therefore, this PCM HSPICE model can provide a correct mirror of the cell 
behaviors and is applicable to PCM chip design.  
A. Awaya (invited talk: Sharp corporation, Japan) reported the Resistive Random 
Access Memory (RRAM) device operation and, consequently, to control device 
operation. To proceed further, it is necessary to accumulate process integration 
experience, to secure statistically significant reliability data, and to turn the present 
development effort toward creation of the optimized circuit designs. They have 
studied TiON films for low power RRAM applications. D. J. Seong reported the 
Pt/Nb:STO Schottky junction for elucidation of ReRAM mechanism. It can be 
explained by oxygen vacancy migration and Schottky barrier height change. L. F. Liu 
reported the improvements of resistive switching characteristics of TiO2 memory 
devices obtained by doping Gd in TiO2 films. The Gd-doped TiO2 memory devices 
showed uniform resistive switching behaviors including Vset of 2.0±0.1V, Vreset of 
0.6±0.1V, and a stable resistance difference by over three orders of magnitude. 
 
96/09/21   Area 4: Advanced Memory Technology (J-7: DRAM II) 
      J. S. Lim (Samsung Electronics) reported the RIT capacitors with 
TiO2/ZrO2 and TiO2/HfO2 layers fabricated for DRAM application of 50nm 
generation and beyond. Superior Toxeq. of 0.72nm was obtained with the low leakage 
sensors with highly selective and sensitive. Single base pair sequence mismatches 
within the DNA target can be easily detected due to the strong PNA/ DNA interaction, 
making the SiNW sensors a viable detection tool. The sensors are also significantly 
important for eliminating the PCR use and by label-free electrical detection extracted 
DNA can be directly identified; hence reducing experimentation time and operation 
costs. Y. Tsujita reported a combination of the amperometric biosensor with CNT 
electrodes and pneumatic micro pumps. They have fabricated microfluidic chips. This 
chip can automatically introduce reagents and electrochemically detect molecules. 
The microfluidic chips with CNT-arrayed electrodes are considered to be a promising 
candidate for development of hand-held electrochemical sensors. S. Kumagai reported 
the novel process for the single electron transistor (SET) device structure through the 
BNP. This process improved the producibility of the device structure. The successful 
construction of the SET device indicated that the fusion technology of biology and 
semiconductor fabrication process will become a powerful method to construct 
functional nanostructures in the nanotechnology. 
 
96/09/21   Area 13: Applications of Nanotubes and Nanowires (J-9: Carbon 
Nanotube Devices and Growth I, and J-10: Carbon Nanotube Devices and 
Growth II) 
      A. Raychowdhuri (invited talk), Intel Corporation, reported the potential 
of carbon nanotube based FETs in future high-performance circuits and mentioned 
key targets that devices need to achieve for digital circuits. However critical 
challenges, like, removing metallic tubes, tube packing density in arrays, doping, 
self-aligned devices, parasitic control and device structure optimization, fabrication of 
nano contacts and dealing with high power densities remain. In spite of these 
challenging barriers, research continues on CNTs because CNFETs may deliver 
high-performance characteristics and scalability for the future. Y. M. Lin (invited 
talk), IBM, have demonstrated a ring oscillator built entirely on a single molecule. 
While this frequency response is still far from the predicted THz performance of 
carbon nanotubes, these results established an essential step towards all-nanotube 
based nanoelectronics. The high quality carbon nanotube and effect of defect in the 
carbon nanotubes have been discussed by K. Grove-Rasmussen (NTT Corporation), 
Japan. T. Kamimura reported  a single charge transition near the channel of SWNT 
SHT at 7.3 K. The observed RTS was depended on the applied gate voltage. They 
estimated the distance between the trap and the channel of SWNT SHT as L=1.03 nm. 
M. Maeda reported the band gap (Eg=0.563 eV) of single carbon nanotube. S. 
Akita reported the thermal conductivity of the nanotube at high temperature depends 
  
Report on IEEE 2008 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop, June 15-16, Honolulu, 
Hawaii, 2008 
It was very interesting workshop on nanowire transistors and materials. There was one 
session on non-volatile memory. I have learned new process and fabrication of 
nanowire MOSFET devices and non-volatile memories. There are many good results 
which can help me for development of nanotechnology. I have included some photos 
and then detail discussion of the workshop below.

97/06/15    Session 1: MOSFETs  
         Dr. Marc Heyns, invited speaker (IMEC), described the different channel 
materials to improve the mobility of the nanoscale MOSFET devices. He has used Ge 
and InGaAs for channel materials. The electrical passivation of the interface between 
the high-k dielectric and the alternative channel materials is one the key issues. The 
interface of HfO2/Ge is better than the HfO2/Si because of the electrical passivation. 
The electron mobility of the 50 nm gate length FinFET devices on (110) surface is 
reported by K. Usuda et al. The Ion (900 mA/mm) is improved +38% due to the uniaxial 
tensile strain on the channel. A. Bowonder et al., UC Berkeley group, reported the 
green or hetero-tunnel transistor (HtFET) with low power operation. The Vdd is as low 
as 0.2V and it can be used on Ge substrate. The promise  of 3x reduction in Vdd and 9x 
reduction in power can be useful in future nanoscale transistor design. V. Barral et al. 
reported that the transport of carriers degradation is due to the Coulomb scattering. 
They have studied on the 30 nm strained and unstrained FDSOI n-MOSFETs with 
HfO2/TiN layers. T. Saraya et al. reported the single-electron-transistor (SET) with 
movable gate electrode. The Coulomb Blockade is observed and a small sub-threshold 
is observed to be 17mV/decade.   
 
      R. J. W. Hill et al. reported that the strained Si can not meet the goal of 22 nm 
CMOS technology. He strongly believed that the material of InGaAs is useful for future 
nanoscale high-speed CMOS applications. A theoretical study on inversion layer 
properties of double gate MOSFET has been reported by H. Kageshima et al. They 
reported that the atomic scale of the channel layer can change the inversion capacitance 
as well as device performance. T. Krishnamohan et al., Stanford University, reported 
the mobility modeling of the strained Ge MOSFET devices. Single gate (SG) quantum 
well (QW) FETs are found to have dramatic mobility degradation at QW thickness of 
less than 6 nm due to strong quantum confinement effects. Theoretical optimums 
obtained through simulations of the mobility, drive current  and switching delay, in 
highly scaled strained Ge QW Fets (channel length=15 nm, thickness of Ge is 5nm), 
suggest an optimum QW thickness of ~2nm. The hole mobility can be enhanced >6x 
for the strained Ge channel MOSFET devices. K. Shimizu et al. reported that the hole 
mobility can be improved 4% by uniaxial compressive strain of 0.03%. It is basically 
the mechanical strain to enhance the mobility of the nanowire devices. C. Shin et al., 
UC Berkeley, reported the threshold voltage control of Tri-gate MOSFET devices by 
controlling the random dopant fluctuation. A. Putra et al. reported the threshold voltage 
variation due to atomic oxide roughness. It is basically simulation work. He also 
reported that the threshold voltage variation is almost independent on the inversion 
layer thickness variation. M. Koyanagi et al., Tohoku University, reported 3D 
integration on a single chip. Many chips are simultaneously aligned and bonded onto 
quantum dots.  
 
       There are also discussion on memory. Y. S. Park et al. reported a resistive 
switching memory by using SbTeN chalcogenide film. By adding an optimum 
nitrogen content in a SbTe film, the on-resistance reduction is successfully 
demonstrated, which is considered to be the first solution to meet the needs for low 
power consumption. They mentioned that the cycling of the memory is good more 
than 104. Y. Shi et al. reported the memory characteristics of GeSi/Si 
hetero-nanocrystals. In this device, the speed and retention can be improved due to the 
band engineering. D. Bae et al. reported the multi-functional URAM (unified-RAM). 
This is new kind of memory to replace the DRAM and flash memory. Y. C. Wu et al. 
reported that a high performance twin poly-Si thin film transistors. The tri-gate 
nanowires structure helps the high program/erase efficiency.      
 
97/06/16    Session 3: Nanowires  
         T. Mayer et al., invited speaker, described the formation of different types 
of nanowires. The thermally-oxidized in-situ axially-doped n+-p--n+ and p+-n--p+ Si 
nanowires with diameters of 20 -50 nm have been grown for p-channel and n-channel 
MOSFETs. A small sub-threshold slope of 20 mV/decade and large Ion/Ioff ration of 
107 have been reported. The low effective mobility of 30 cm2/V.s is due to the Si/SiO2 
interface problem. The nanowire mobility can be improved by unixial strain on the 
device. Y. J. Jeong et al. reported the current enhancement in the nanowire MOSFET 
by uniaxial tensile strain. M. Pierre et al. reported the Coulomb blockade in very near 
two quantum dots. Although the nanowires are very important for future nanoscale 
CMOS applications but the noise of those devices are very important. Significant 
dispersion of noise spectral density was observed by J. Zhuge et al.. The noise was 
bias dependence. S. Yang et al. reported the low frequency noise (1/f) of p-type Si 
nanowire transistors but it is also bias dependence.  
 
      Schenk et al. reported the quantum simulation of Si nanowire transistors. A. 
Asenov et al. reported the ‘ab initio’ simulation of discrete dopants in the source and 
drain of a nanowire transistors. Optimization of dopant-induced quantum dot arrays 
for single electron transistor operation was demonstrated by D. Moraru et al. The 
potential profile can be adjusted on the top and back gates in the nanowire SOI-FETs. 
Controlling the dopant in the conduction path, the single electron current cam be 
controlled. B. H. Hong et al. reported the temperature dependent transport of 
cylindrical shaped gate-all-around Si nanowire MOSFETs. Single electron tunneling 
behaviors can be observed at 4.2K. They have noticed a single peak for tunneling at 
low temperature and it can be observed at room temperature. The capture of single 
electron in Si nanowire MOSFET has been observed by A. Fujiwara et al.  These 
findings might open up a way of utilizing a non-equilibrium process to break the
