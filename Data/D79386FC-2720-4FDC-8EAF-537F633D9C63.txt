ABSTRACT 
The study contains descriptions of landslides and debris flows in a small upland 
catchment in Taiwan between 1986 and 2004. This catchment, the Chushui Creek, is 
situated near the epicenter of the 1999 M7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake that is an area with 
high background erosion rate. The Chi-Chi earthquake caused a sharp increase of the 
rate of mass wasting in the epicentral area, and the data presented in this study 
illustrates the geomorphic change associated with the earthquake in details. The 
measurements of the geometry of the trunk stream of the Chushui catchment also 
show its change due to the impact of a strong typhoon in 1996. Two channel reaches 
that were affected by separate debris flows during this event were identified. Each 
reach has three sections: scour, transfer and deposition. Cross profiles of these 
sections show a systematic change from V-shaped bedrock channel in the scour areas 
to flat-floored channel in the transfer and deposition areas. Debris flows also occurred 
in other occasions in this channel, and their frequency has increased since the 1999 
earthquake. In addition, this study contains precise geographic and statistical 
descriptions of the landslides triggered by three typhoons and an earthquake that 
affected the catchment since 1996. The total landslide area is measured for different 
time intervals, and a marked increase in landslide incidence is found after the 1999 
earthquake. Frequency-area plots of the 126 landslides in the catchment indicate a 
power-law scaling with an exponent about -1.5 of these quantities, as has been 
observed in other studies. We propose that a link exists between landslide 
frequency-area distributions and initialization of debris flow in the catchment. It may 
be classified as a self-organized criticality process with a critical frequency-area 
distribution for the landslide population. In this case, the landslide frequency-area 
distribution is useful in quantifying the severity of the trigger and the contribution of 
landslides to debris flow.

INTRODUCTION 
There are three basic problems in considering the relationship between landslide 
and triggering of debris flow. One is the stability analysis of streambank. Hergarten 
and Neugebauer (1998) revealed that the riverbanks failure can be seen as a 
self-organized criticality system. A system is under “self-organized criticality” if a 
measure of the system fluctuates about a state of marginal stability (Malamud & 
Turcotte, 2000). Another is to study the landslide-debris flow sequencing (Iverson et 
al., 1997). The third problem is to clarify the landslide magnitude-frequency

channel is also shown in Figure 2(a). The initiation process of the debris flow in the 
creek during Typhoon Herb (1996) includes two surges. One surge was the steep slope 
scouring-transportation-deposition cycle caused by hillslope instability in an elevation 
over 1,500 m. The upwelling of groundwater under steep streambed as drawn in 
Figure 2(a) is believed to attribute to the second surge of scouring- 
transportation-deposition cycle below 1,500 m. The second surge of initiated debris 
flow was examined by an on-site investigation on 3 December 2004 after the impact 
of Typhoon Mindulle. The gush of groundwater was located within an elevation of 
1,400 to 1,500 m and at the scouring zone of the second surge of debris flow initiated 
in 1996 during Typhoon Herb. The well up and infill process of the water exchange 
was believed to lead to the steep slope at the upper stream channel. It is hard to judge 
the water exchange with the bedrock or only within the channel fill without further 
field explorations. Alternatively, the upwelling of groundwater can cause instability of 
debris masses at the streambed and their mobility could induce flash flood during 
rainstorm. No evidence exhibited clearly the triggering order of surge I and II debris 
flows. One could be initiated first, or both could be triggered at the same time by the 
different triggering mechanisms. 
The transverse profile change after Typhoon Herb initiated the debris flow is 
shown in Figure 2(b) for both surges. The differences between scour and 
transfer-deposition zones are V-shaped channel in the scour zone, but flat floored, 
wide channel in the transfer/deposition zone. The overland flow of debris masses 
contributed to the flatter topographic characteristics of the deposition zone. The 
transportation zone was featured by the change of the stream channel. The scoured 
streambed and the unstable streamside were the main features in the source area. 
 
LANDSLIDE FREQUENCY-AREA DISTRIBUTION AND THE INITIATION 
OF DEBRIS FLOW 
 
To clarify the landslides history induced by each trigger in the catchment, 
landslide intensity is determined from a time scaling of air photographs from 1993 to 
2004 at a 1:5000. The landslide inventory was supplemented by detailed field 
geomorphic investigations in April 2004 at the pilot site. The landslides were mapped 
in GIS according to the year of aerial photographs but with less consideration on their 
reactivation or recoverability characteristics. The mapped landslides in the catchment, 
that includes the delimited landslides induced by Typhoon Herb in 1996, the Chi-Chi 
earthquake in 1999, Typhoon Toraji in 2001 and Typhoon Mindulle in 2004 
respectively. 
 Figure 3 illustrates the variation of the total landslide areas after each trigger in 
 6
magnitude frequency distribution with an exponent of α = -0.84 and -0.89 for 
rainfall induced landslides in terraced areas and woodland areas respectively in 
Central Alps, Italy (Crosta et al., 2003). For both area, β = -1.85 for noncumulative 
frequency-area distribution. Power-law relation withα= -2.3~-3.3 in frequency-area 
distribution of landslides is usually found (Turcotte, 1999). Guzzetti et al. (2002) 
examined two data sets of historical landslides and snowmelt induced in the 
Umbria-Marche area of central Italy, and the power-law with an exponent -2.5 in the 
noncumulative frequency-area distribution of these landslides was found. For 
comparison, the exponent was -2.3 after the Northridge earthquake in 1994. The 
landslide frequency-area statistics from Italy, Guatemala and the USA triggered by 
snowmelt, rainfall and earthquake respectively were found to be well described by a 
power-law distribution with exponent -2.4 (Malamud et al., 2004). The available 
literatures (Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld, 1988; Hovius et al., 1997, 2000; Pelletier et al., 
1997; Guzzetti et al., 2002; Turcotte et al., 2002; Crosta et al., 2003; Fonstad and 
Marcus, 2003; Rouai and Jaaidi, 2003; Malamud et al., 2004) in recent years. The 
smaller value of power-law slope in the Chushui creek could underlying that the 
physics of the debris flow are very different from many of the landslides in literature 
(Malamud et al., 2004). 
The power-law exponent is sensitive to the fit procedure and dominated by many 
factors, the above mentioned literatures retain the coincidence of landslide 
frequency-area distributions by variety triggers. Although these power-law 
distributions are not confined to self-organized criticality systems (Phillips, 1999). 
Bak (1996) stated that “If a linear trend fits the power-law distribution well over a 
large range of event magnitudes, the system is likely self-organized and may be at the 
critical state.” Hergarten and Neugebauer (1998) suggested that landsliding may be 
seen as a self-organized criticality process based on partial differential equations. The 
fundamental question is weather landslide power-law distributions at the catchment 
represent a self-organized criticality system. For instance, a pile of sand is expected to 
exhibit self-organized criticality, for the slope is too steep, the pile is far from 
equilibrium, and the pile will collapse until an angle of repose (a critical value) 
reached where the system is barely stable (Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld, 1987). 
In the Chushui catchment, the induced landslides after Typhoon Toraji and 
Mindulle are far beyond the rate of climate-triggered landslides after strong ground 
motion. The debris flows or local surge flows can be driven by the same processes, 
with the size of failure depending not only on the process but also on the overall state 
of the system at that time. We postulate that the induced landslides at the Chushui 
catchment after Typhoon Toraji and Mindulle approached critical state of failure when 
the system exhibits consistent power-law behavior and may be seen as a
