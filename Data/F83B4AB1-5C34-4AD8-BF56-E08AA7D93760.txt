magnetic-bead and enzyme-encapsulated alginate micro bead, it is not only tackle several critical issues such 
as enzyme immobilization and long term preservation of enzyme in micro-channel but also provide several 
advantages such as reduction of mass transfer when using encapsulation method and multiple target detection 
when magnetic-bead coated with different kinds of enzymes. The proposed EIS sensor embedded microfluidic 
chip with magnetic-bead enzyme immobilization method paves a route for robust point-of-care system. 
 
Materials and methods 
2.1. Chip design and measurement principle 
Figure 1(a) shows a schematic illustration of the EIS sensor incorporated microfluidic chip, which is 
composed of four layers. On the bottom of the chip, an EIS sensor is attached on a glass substrate with an 
aluminum electrode to conduct the sensing signal from the bottom of the EIS sensor. Two 
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers in the middle of the chip are used to perform the fluid handling function. 
A cross-shape micro-channel is designed to load three kinds of sample into detection area and three pneumatic 
micro-valves are located on the intersection of cross-shape micro-channel to control the fluid in the chip. On 
the top of the chip, an Ag/AgCl thin film reference electrode is fabricated on the glass substrate to provide a 
reference potential when the measurement is conducted. Figure 1(b) shows a cross-sectional view of the chip. 
A step-high micro-structure is designed and fabricated in the micro-channel to facilitate the immobilization on 
enzyme-encapsulated alginate micro-bead. The higher channel is 200 μm and the lower one is 70 μm in height. 
It is worthily mentioned that because the EIS solid–state sensor is attached on the glass substrate, it forms a 
bump structure located on the micro-channel and that would cause the instable flow or dead volume around 
the bump structure. As a result, a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184A and 184B, Sil-More 
Industrial Ltd., USA) layer is utilized to fill up the bump structure and thus the micro-channel becomes flat. A 
photograph of the assembled chip is shown in figure 1(c). The microfluidic chip size is 7.6 x 5.2 cm and the 
incorporated solid-state sensor is 1 x 1 cm in size.  
Figure 2 illustrates the measurement principle of the chip. The experimental procedure of the sample 
measurement is described as following. First, three types of the enzyme-magnetic powder-contained alginate 
micro-bead are generated by using a microfluidic-based pneumatically-driven micro-vibrator with three kinds 
of enzymes, glucose oxidase, urease and, creatinine deaminase ,respectively. Each type of alginate bead 
contains its own enzyme. Besides, magnetic beads can be also used to coate with two kind of enzymes, 
creatinine deaminase and glucose oxidase. Then the enzyme-contained alginate beads or the enzyme-coated 
magnetic bead are injected into micro-channel sequentially from different inlet. The micro-valves are used to 
control the fluid to ensure that only one kind of enzyme-encapsulated alginate bead or enzyme-coated 
magnetic bead is introduced into the detection area at one time. Then the alginate bead would be blocked and 
immobilized on the surface of the EIS sensor through the step-high structure in the micro-channel. At the 
 5
equilibrium constants of the acid and base reactions, respectively, on the sensing membrane; and CDL is the 
capacitance of the electrical double layer, as derived by the Gouy-Chapman-Stern model.  
2.3. Chip fabrication 
The EIS structures featuring a 20 nm high-k Dy2TiO5 sensing membrane were fabricated on 4-inch p-type 
Si (100) wafers with a rapid thermal annealing process at 800 oC for 30 s in O2 ambient, which was based on 
our previous work. After the EIS sensor was cut in 1x1 cm2, the EIS sensor die was attached on the bottom 
glass substrate with aluminium electrode by using high conductive silver glue (SYP-8888, AGPRO, Taiwan). 
The top and bottom glass substrate with metal electrode were fabricated by standard lift-off process. The 
different is that the bottom substrate was evaporated with aluminium (300 nm) and the top one was with silver 
(400 nm) material. It is worth mentioned that the top substrate is worked as a reference electrode so that at the 
tip of the silver electrode the FeCl3 was used to modify the silver metal layer to be an Ag/AgCl layer. The 
modified process was optimized as dipping the silver thin flim into the 0.05 M FeCl3 solution for 2 s to form 
the AgCl layer. Note that the reference electrode was made just by thin film deposition technique without 
buffer solution surrounded. It is known that the reference electrode without buffer solution would cause the 
unstable of measuring signal. A few references have proposed some tackling approaches.16-17 In this study, we 
focus on the integration of solid-state sensor in microfluidic chip and the enzyme immobilized method for the 
chip. All of the measuring samples were kept in same concentration of chloride ion to avoid the unstable of 
reference potential and simplify the fabrication process of the reference electrode. Besides, two middle 
microfluidic component layers were fabricated through standard SU-8 (SU-8-50, MicroChem, USA) 
photolithograph, micro curving machining, and PDMS replicate process. Finally, the four layers were align 
and bonded by oxygen plasma treatment process. 
2.4. Sample preparation and experimental setup 
All the chemical reagents are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. At the beginning, the concentration of 
glucose, urea, and creatinine are prepared to be 8 mM, 16 mM, and 10 mM. Then three solutions are series 
diluted to be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 mM; 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 mM and 0.01, 0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10 mM, respectively, which cover 
the meaningful range in human blood. On the other hand, the enzyme-encapsulated alginate-Ca micro beads 
are prepared as following. First, the mixture of enzyme and 100 μl alginate-Na (2 wt%) dissolved in deionized 
(DI) water and 100 μl magnetic powder with concentration of 2x109 beads ml-1 dissolved in DI water is 
prepared for dispersion flow and the corn oil is for continuous flow to form the emulsion droplet. Depending 
on the measurement target, the aforementioned enzyme can be selected as glucose oxidase 10 mg, urease 50 
mg, or creatinine deiminase 5 mg. The alginate-Na droplet is solidified by using 0.4 mM CaCl2. Besides, the 
serum is obtained from the researcher himself. The measuring results in microfluidic chip are compared with 
the result conducted by the commercial kit used in clinic measurement (GLUCOSE liquicolor and 
CREATININE liquicolor, Human, Wiesbaden, Germany; MeDiPro-BUN, Formosa Biomedical Technology, 
 7
microstructure and right side of the microstructure, the height of micro-channel is 200 and 70 μm, respectively. 
Before the enzyme-encapsulated alginate bead loaded in the micro-channel, there is nothing blocked by the 
microstructure (fig. 3 (d)). After the 170 μm alginate micro bead injected in the micro-channel, because the 
micro-channel size is smaller than the bead, the micro beads were blocked by the microstructure and packaged 
on the surface of the sensor (fig. 3 (e)). During this injection process, we observe that when the alginate bead 
size is smaller than 90 μm, they will penetrate the microstructure. Because the alginate bead is a hydrogel 
based microsphere and has soft property, the blocking force generated from the microstructure cannot stand 
the drag force acted on the alginate bead at the fluid flow rate of 480 μl min-1. In addition to the 
microstructure, the magnetic powder contained alginate bead also can be manipulated by the application of 
external magnetic field. With the aid of external magnetic force, the alginate bead can be further packaged 
together, i.e. the distance between bead and bead can be very closed. This may provide the higher quantity of 
enzyme to react with the sample. With enzyme-magnetic powder-encapsulated alginate micro bead as an 
enzyme delivery and enzyme immobilization carrier, it is not only tackle the issues of enzyme immobilization 
and long term preservation of enzyme in micro-channel but also provide several merits such as multiple target 
detection when alginate bead encapsulated with different kinds of enzymes and reduction the length of mass 
diffusion when using encapsulation method. Compare the experimental result from the traditional 
encapsulation approach using bulk alginate-Ca film on the EIS sensor, the alginate micro bead method 
performs higher measuring sensitivity and shorter reaction time. For example, the reaction time can be 
shortened form 1 min to 20 s. 
3.2. Size-tunable enzyme-encapsulated alginate micro bead generation 
In this study, the demand of enzyme reacting with detection target in microfluidic chip was carried and 
immobilized by using alginate hydrogel micro bead, which is generated by another microfluidic chip through 
pneumatic driven vibrators method based on our previous work. In order to immobilize enzyme-contained 
alginate bead using microstructure, a suitable size of alginate bead should be generated. In our previous study, 
the size of alginate bead can be tuned by the injection flow rate of alginate-Na suspension and the driving 
frequency of the pneumatic vibrator. Figure 4(a) shows the different mean size of enzyme-encapsulated 
alginate-Ca bead ranging from 90 to 170 μm can be successfully generated. We experimentally find that the 
driving frequency and its corresponding flow rate are 1 Hz and 0.5 μl min-1, 1 Hz and 1 μl min-1, 1.5 Hz and 
1.5 μl min-1, 1.5 Hz and 2 μl min-1, 2 Hz and 2 μl min-1, respectively. Figure 4(b) reveals the uniformity of 
alginate micro bead for each mean size. It can be observed that the larger the bead is the more uniform the 
size is. The reason maybe that because the alginate suspension has high viscosity property, at low driving flow 
rate, the alginate may stick on the tip of the vibrator needle when the alginate emulsion droplet is formed. As 
a result, the size of alginate bead may not be so uniform as it is formed at higher driving flow rate. The 
biggest variation of size was generated to be 10.3% (coefficient of variation, the ratio of the standard 
 9
5.28 mV/mM. As a result, we choose 5 μl (2x109 #/ml) magnetic-bead coated with glucose oxidase for 
glucose measure. Figure 6(b) shows the relationship between reaction time versus sensitivity and linearity 
with bead quantity of 5 μl (2x109 #/ml). It can be found that when reaction time is larger than 30 s, the 
sensitivity can reach to a plateau. Besides, at the reaction time of 60 s, the highest sensing linearity can 
achieve, so we choose 60 s for the optimal reaction time when measuring glucose. When choosing the 
reaction time for 120 s, the enzyme in high concentration of glucose reveals not enough for reaction so that 
the trend of reference voltage becomes flatter. We conclude that the reaction time cannot be too long for each 
concentration detection or the enzyme would be exhausted in the several beginning test.  
Similarly, the operation condition of creatinine measurement is also optimized. Figure 7(a) and 7(b) show 
the optimal magnetic-bead quantity and reaction time for creatinine measurement. It can be observed, in 
figure 7(a), that the highest sensitivity can be achieved when the bead volume is 10 μl (2x109 #/ml) and the 
linearity is relatively stable (at least more than 0.9687) in the measuring range of 10-2 to 10 mM with 
measuring time of 60 s. On the other hand, the optimal reaction time for ctreatinine measurement can be 
found through figure 7(b). Both of the sensitivity and linearity can achieve highest value at the reaction time 
of 60 s with the bead quantity of 10 μl (2x109 #/ml). It is worth of mention that the optimal condition for 
glucose and creatinine measurement is not the same in bead quantity because the binding efficiency of two 
kinds of enzyme with two kinds of beads is not the same. Besides, the measuring range of glucose and 
creatinine is also different since the meaningful range of these two indicators in human body is not the same. 
With the magnetic-bead enzyme deliver method, different kind of enzyme can be immobilized on sensor 
surface in micro-channel. The capability of multi-target detection can be expected by using proposed idea. 
Experimental result also shows that the paramagnetic bead reveals good magnetic property. Under the flow 
rate of 14.39 ml min-1 (maximum value generated by syringe pump), magnetic bead can still be attracted in 
the micro-channel.  
 
3.4.1. Measurement glucose, urea, and creatinine in serum with enzyme-contained alginate bead 
Glucose, urea, and creatinine are the important indicators for diabetes or kidney disease. In this study, we 
want to measure these three indicators in serum by single microfluidic chip. According to the optimal 
operation parameter described above, all of the measurement is utilized 170 μm enzyme-contained alginate 
bead with 20 s reaction time. Figure 8(a)～(c) show that the concentration of glucose, urea, and creatinine ine 
human serum are successfully measured by using the proposed micofluidic chip and enzyme immobilization 
method. All the measurements were conducted using the sample procedure. Firstly, the standard cure was 
conducted by using the concentration known sample. Then the serum was prepared as an unknown sample for 
measurement. Finally, a voltage signal can be measured through serum sample and thus the corresponding 
concentration of detection target can be achieved. With the standard curve, experimental data reveal high

Operation principle of sensing glucose, creatinine, and urea in EIS sensor embedded microfluidic chip. The 
enzyme-magnetic powder-encapsulated alginate micro bead was introduced into micro-channel and located 
and immobilized on the top of EIS sensor by the step-high microstructure and the external magnetic field. 
Then, the corresponding sample was injected into micro-channel and reacts with enzyme contained in the 
alginate bead. During the reaction process, the hydrogen ion was released and the change of the potential on 
the sensor surface can be detected by EIS sensor.

本研究係將半導體 EIS 感測器整合入微流體晶片中，並利用一種新式酵素固定化技術，將
酵素導入微流道當中，使半導體感測器不但可以偵測血液中氫離子濃度，更可透過對應的
酵素測得血清中血糖、尿素、肌酐酸的濃度。此種酵素固定技術，第一種是利用油水不互
溶的原理將海澡膠製備成包埋酵素與磁珠的乳化微球，並用鈣離子將其固化，當感測晶片
需要酵素進行催化反應時，帶有酵素及磁珠的海藻膠微球可被通入微流體晶片中，並利用
晶片中微結構及晶片外磁性物質，固定在半導體感測器上進行生物感測。另一種方式為利
用表面修飾酵素的磁珠，本研究成功利用羧基磁珠與胺基磁珠傳遞肌酐酸及尿素反應的酵
素到微流道中，待要使用酵素催化時再通入微流體晶片中。傳統的固定化技術要將酵素固
定於微流體生物感測晶片上的製程上較於困難，且酵素的活性會隨著時間增加而減少，進
而影響晶片的感測特性。這兩種方式皆使酵素容易地固定於微流道中，使用後也容易替換
新的酵素微膠球或酵素磁珠。此酵素固定技術具有可替換、可包埋任意酵素等優點，且酵
素固定及酵素保存問題在微流體晶片中一直是個難以解決的問題，相信藉由本研究發展出
之海藻膠微球包埋酵素的方法，可有效解決酵素於微流體晶片中長時間保存的問題。最
