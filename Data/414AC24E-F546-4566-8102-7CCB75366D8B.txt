mobility. For comparison we fabricated an 
Al2O3/InGaAs MOSFET which gave a 
significantly lower mobility than the 
InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs. However the 
mobility value was higher than that of GOI 
devices [9]. The mobility improvement was 
limited by soft-phonon and interface 
scattering.

二、實驗步驟 
The first goal was to integrate the III-V 
material onto Si by forming a wafer-bonded 
CSOI structure, as shown in the process of Fig. 
1. An inverted InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs HEMT 
structure was first grown on InP by Molecular 
Beam Epitaxy (MBE) [14-16]. Then a SiO2 
layer was deposited on top of the InAlAs and 
the target Si wafer. To enhance the 
wafer-bonding at low temperatures an O2+ 
exposure was used to activate the SiO2 
surfaces, and the bonding was performed at 
400oC [8-12]. Then the InP substrate was 
thinned down followed by selective etching of 
the InP and InAlAs. InGaAs is a good etch 
stop when using an HCl-based solution, 
compared with InP and InAlAs. To fabricate a 
CSOI HEMT, the top n+ InGaAs contact layer 
over the gate was recess-etched to the InAlAs, 
where the gate electrode was formed by a 
Ti/Au Schottky contact. Then the source-drain 
contacts were formed by NiGeAu deposition 
[16].  
A high-κ/III-V MOSFET was also 
investigated in this study [17]. We used MBE 
to grow the 20nm-InGaAs/300nm-InAlAs 
quantum-well (QW) structure on an InP 
substrate. Then the Al2O3 gate dielectric was 
deposited by RF sputtering from an Al2O3 
source. To study the Al2O3/InGaAs interface 
properties, the InGaAs surface with or without 
in-situ atomic Al layer coverage was 
investigated before exposing the InGaAs to air. 
The Al-gate/Al2O3/InGaAs/InAlAs MOSFET 
was fabricated by gate patterning, self-aligned 
Al/Yb deposition, and 400oC rapid thermal 
annealing (RTA) to form the Schottky 
Source-Drain (SSD) contacts [18-20]. Such 
SSD contacts for InGaAs can avoid the 
difficult challenge of n+ ion implantation 
activation for Source-Drain contacts, as used 
in conventional CMOSFET fabrication. 
 
三、結果與討論 
3.1.InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs-OI transistor: 
An InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs-OI device was 
examined by cross-sectional transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 
2(a), where no dislocations were seen at the 
resolution shown – this is important for 
high-yield IC fabrication. The white line in
