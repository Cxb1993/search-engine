I.  Introduction 
Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is thought to have superior potential for 
commercialization because of its high energy conversion efficiency, self-reforming 
ability, compatibility with common hydrocarbon fuels, use of solid state materials, 
and no need of noble metals as catalysts [1]. SOFC can be used in large-size 
stationary power facilities or applied to heat and power generation for homes and 
businesses as well as auxiliary power units for electrical systems in transportation 
vehicles. Planar-type SOFCs are superior to those with tubular designs because of 
their simple manufacturing process and the promise of a high power density [2]. 
Though planar-type SOFCs offer a new alternative for future clean power generation 
and utilization, commercialization has been hindered by a lack of long-term cell 
durability, caused mainly by the cracking of the seals among cell components during 
thermal cycling that creates passageways for the fuel and oxidizing gases. A good 
sealing material has to meet several rigorous requirements, including low leakage; 
thermal, chemical and electrical compatibility with the fuel and the cell components, 
and maintenance of mechanical integrity [3,4]. It also has to be robust to numerous 
thermal cycles and reliable for long-term operation at high temperatures. Of the three 
major sealing technologies (glass and glass ceramic seals, mica-based compressive 
seals and silver-based active braze seals) [5-10], glass and glass-ceramics have been

earth metal changed from Ba to Ca to Mg, the activation energy of crystal growth 
increased significantly in response to the field strength. It was further observed that 
the increase of Al2O3 content would induce phase separation and decrease activation 
of crystallization. In their study on the mechanical properties of 
56.4BaO-8.8CaO-5.4Al2O3-7.3B2O3-22.1SiO2 and 
35BaO-15CaO-5Al2O3-10B2O3-35SiO2 with addition of BN nanotube as the seal glass 
composite, Choi et al. [30] found that the strength and fracture toughness increased 
while density, elastic modulus and micro-hardness of the composite dropped as 
compared to the unreinforced glass. Taniquchi et al. [31] examined the 
25BaO-10Al2O3-15B2O3-49SiO2 glass with a trace amount of As2O3 and Na2O as the 
sealing material. Ceramic-fiber of 52SiO2-48Al2O3 was arranged around the 
electrolyte to prevent the glass from contacting the electrolyte.  
In a previous study evaluating the composites of selected BaO-Al2O3-SiO2-B2O3 
glasses and MgO additive for use as sealing materials of solid oxide fuel cells 
(SOFCs), [32], the composites remained structurally and thermally stable at high 
temperatures with the change in time while the leakage rates appeared to be lower 
than the acceptable limit. However, it was observed that glasses containing alkaline 
earth metals were easily vulnerable to the formation of BaCrO4 and SrCrO4 second 
phase at the edges of the joints where oxygen or air was accessible, when in contact

for 10 hours in a planetary ball mill. The pulverized glass powders were then 
subjected to phase analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku DMX-2200) with 
Cu-Kα radiation to confirm their amorphous nature. To prepare the glass slab for 
evaluation of physical characteristics, a portion of the molten glasses was cast into a 
stainless-steel mold and then moved into a furnace preheated at 800°C and slowly 
cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 1°C/min. The glass slab was cut by a 
diamond saw into test specimens with dimensions of 5×5×5 mm3 and 5×5×15 mm3 
used respectively for softening point test and thermal expansion test. The CTE of the 
glass specimen was evaluated, using a NETZSCH DIL 402C dilatometer in air at a 
heating rate of 3°C/min. The softening point of the glass was measured by a glass test 
instrument (Orton SP-3A) according to the ASTM C-338 method. Apparent density 
measurement of the La2O3-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 annealed glass specimens with the 
dimension of 5×5×15 mm3 was conducted using a liquid displacement method with 
water as the medium. Phase identification on the glass was performed after annealing 
at 800°C for 25, 50, 100, and 200 hours using XRD. Scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM, Hitachi S4700) studies were conducted to reveal the microstructures of the 
samples. 
Adhesion of the glasses on the stainless steel (SUS430) was evaluated. SUS430 
was carefully polished and cleaned with deionized water and acohol. Approximately, 
1 gram of glass was pelletized into small plates with a diameter of 5 mm and placed 
on the cleaned surface of a SUS430 substrate. After cautiously put in a furnace, the 
SUS430 substrate was heated to 1000°C for 1 hour and then soaked at 800°C up to 
100 hours. Examination of the glass on the SUS430 substrate was performed using the

III. Results and Discussion 
The glass compositions based on the molar percentage prepared in the study are 
shown in Figure 2 and specified in Table 1. The pulverized glass powders after 
quenching appeared to be amorphous, except for A01 glass that showed partially 
crystallization of pyrochlore La2Si2O7 phase (Figure 3). A01, therefore, did not 
proceed with any further characterization. The physical properties, including densities, 
glass transition points (Tg), softening points (Ts), and temperature coefficients of 
thermal expansion (CTE), of La2O3-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glasses are listed in Table 2. 
The densities of A02-A09 glasses ranged from 3.24 (A09 glass) to 4.54 g/cm3 (A02 
glass). Apparent density rose evidently with the La2O3 content in the glass, due to the 
high molecular weight of La2O3 (358 g/mole). The density seemed to show no 
significant difference with the variation in Al2O3 and B2O3+SiO2 ratio. B2O3 content 
in glass plays an important role in reducing viscosity, stabilizing the amorphous 
nature, and improving wettability of the glass on steel and YSZ [15,19]. However, in 
other studies, it has been suggested that B2O3 may evaporate in the forms of HBO2 
and B(OH)3 in the presence of water steam at cell operating temperatures [21]. The 
range of B2O3 content in the glass systems was therefore kept below 10 mol%. 
It is usually the glass softening point (Ts) that determines the bottom temperature 
limit for the sealing process of SOFCs. No significant difference were found among 
the glass softening points that ranged from 914 (A08 glass) to 934°C (A09 glass), 
based on the measurements using the glass test instrument (Orton SP-3A). Effect of 
the difference in La2O3, Al2O3 and B2O3 contents on the softening points remained 
limited, though A09 glass with rich SiO2 (50 m%) reported a slightly higher softening 
point than others. SiO2 and B2O3 were network formers in the glass structure while 
La2O3 acted as a network modifier to weaken the network. Al2O3 served as a network

detectable crystallization even after the soaking time hit 200 hours. 
Adhesion tests between the SUS430 stainless steel (CTE=10.4 ppm/°C) and the 
glasses, including A06 (CTE=6.4 ppm/°C), A07(CTE=7.2 ppm/°C), and A08 
(CTE=6.8 ppm/°C) glasses, were performed after heat treatment at 1000°C for 30 
minutes followed by soaking at 800°C for 100 hours. A08 glass on SUS430 betrayed 
poor adhesion as it could be easily peeled off after cooling while A06 and A07 glasses 
demonstrated good adhesion to SUS430. Samples of A06 glass and A07 glasses on 
SUS430 were then examined via SEM and EDS studies to identify any diffusion or 
chemical interaction at the glass/stainless steel interfaces, and the results are shown in 
Figures 6 and 7. From the results of EDS line scans across the interfaces, there is no 
diffusion of elements including Cr, Fe, Si, and La across the boundaries, though the 
reactions between Cr and the glasses were commonly reported in the literature. These 
observations were expected since the glasses prepared in this study are free of alkaline 
earth metals. It surely reinforces the feasibility of being used as sealing materials for 
SOFC applications. 
In order to match the CTE compatibility with other cell components like YSZ, 
stainless steel, and lanthanum manganite, a glass seal with CTE value in the range of 
8.5 ~12 ppm°C was found to be effective for metal–metal and metal–electrolyte 
sealing [34]. It is therefore apparent that additives are needed to adjust the CTE values 
of the La2O3-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 glasses. Two CTE modifiers, MgO and SDC, were 
then added into A06 and A07 glasses. Both MgO (13.4x10-6 ppm/°C) and SDC 
(12.6x10-6 ppm/°C) reported a higher CTE than the glasses prepared in this study and 
showed a nearly linear dimensional change in the temperatures ranging from room 
temperature to 1000°C. MgO has recently been used as a crystallization inhibitor in 
the BaO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass [13] and a CTE modifier in several glasses [23,32]. SDC is

sustain a high structural stability with the change in time. Though adding 60 to 70% 
of both MgO and SDC in A06 or A07 glass could tailor the CTEs within the lower 
limit required for the sealing of SOFCs (Table 4), it was reported that MgO-glass 
composite registered a lower high temperature stability in the presence of water vapor 
and crippled the potential of MgO as a CTE modifier for the La2O3-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2 
glasses. 
Figure 10 shows the results of the leakage test of the A06-60 vol% SDC, A06-70 
vol% SDC, A07-60 vol% SDC, and A07-70 vol% SDC seals on the YSZ plate, using 
the setup displayed in Figure 1. The sealing process was carried out employing paste 
technology during heating and working schedule of SOFC [14]. The leakage rate of 
the glass seal was measured at 800°C after heating at 1000°C for 1 hour. The 
detectable leaking limit of gas flow meter in the setup was less than 0.02 (sccm/cm) 
(kg/cm2) per min. (i.e. less than 0.02 sccm of gas leaking out from 1 cm length of 
sealing for 1 minute under a loading pressure of 1 kg/cm2). The leakage rate was 
significantly reduced at temperature higher than 400°C. Sealing in the temperatures 
below 400°C was associated with a significant weight loss in the glass seal due to the 
removal of alcohol and PVA, based on the DTA/TGA results. Densification and 
sealing effect of the composites were obtained through viscous flow at temperatures 
slightly higher than the glass softening point [14]. Both A07-60 vol% SDC and 
A07-70 vol% SDC seals composites reported a leakage rate lower than 0.02 sccm/cm 
at temperatures above 400°C while the leakage rates of A06-60 vol% SDC and 
A06-70 vol% SDC fell in the range of 0.05-0.07 sccm/cm. This property seems very 
promising in supporting the long-term stability of the sealing materials for SOFC 
applications [23].
