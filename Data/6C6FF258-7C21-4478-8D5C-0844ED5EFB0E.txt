1. Introduction 
Groundwater is a precious natural freshwater resource and has advantages of convenient 
availability near the point of use, excellent quality, and relatively low cost of development [Todd 
and Mays, 2005].  The groundwater resource usually is not allowed to pump for private use 
without governmental permit.  Illegal pumping may have an adverse effect on the groundwater 
flow system, and moreover disturb the quality of the groundwater in a groundwater 
contamination site.  An illegal pumping may change the groundwater flow pattern and agitate 
the capture zone at an ongoing remediation site.  Thus, there is a need to develop a methodology 
for estimating the unknown pumping source information from a practical viewpoint. 
Stochastic optimization methods such as genetic algorithms (GAs) and simulated annealing 
(SA) are the new global optimization methods.  Differing from the gradient-type approaches, 
these global optimization methods are iteratively to renew the trial solution by the objective 
function value in determining the global optimum.  The first advantage of these global 
optimization methods is that the user doesn’t need much experience in providing the initial 
guesses for solving optimization problems.  The initial guesses can be arbitrarily given or even 
generated by a random number generator, and still achieve optimal results.  The second 
advantage is that these global optimization methods do not need the calculations for the derivates 
to renew the trial solution.  The global optimization methods were successfully applied in wide 
range of optimization applications such as capacity extension for pipe network system [Cunha 
and Sousa, 1999; Monem and Namdarian, 2005], parameter calibration and identification 
problems [Zheng and Wang, 1996; Cooper et al., 1997; Li et al., 1999; Guo and Zheng, 2005; Lin 
and Yeh, 2005; Yeh et al., 2006], groundwater management problems [Dougherty and Marryott, 
1991; Marryott et al., 1993], groundwater remediation system problems [Kuo et al., 1992; 
Marryott, 1996; Rizzo and Daugherty, 1996; Tung et al., 2003; Shieh and Peralta, 2005], and 
source identification of groundwater contamination problems.  Romeo and 
Sangiovanni-Vincentelli [1991] used homogeneous and inhomogeneous Markov chain theories to 
prove that SA can converge to global optimal solutions.  SA was an evolution from descent 
search method, but the major drawback of the descent method was the obtained solution might 
end up in a local optimum [Rayward-Smith et al., 1996].  To avoid obtaining local optimum, the 
Metropolis mechanism controls which ascent moves could be accepted [Rayward-Smith et al., 
1996].  Therefore, the SA has a property of using descent strategy but allowing random ascent 
moves to avoid possible trap in a local optimum, preventing the SA from having the same 
problem as the descent method.  In addition, Shieh and Peralta [2005] mentioned that the 
straightforward formulation, no requirement for computing derivatives, and easily implemented 
with ground water simulation models, are the main advantages as employed SA to solve the 
optimization problem. 
The aim of this work is to develop an approach called SA-MF using SA incorporated with 
the numerical flow model, modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water flow model 
(or called MODFLOW-2000).  The numerical approach can be used to estimate the pumping 
source information including the pumping source location, pumping rate, and pumping period in 
 3
solution.

The fourth step is to check the trial solution with the correspondent OFV to see whether this 
one is a new optimum or not.  If the OFV of the trial solution is better than the current optimal 
solution or if the trial solution satisfies Metropolis’s criterion, the current optimal solution is 
replaced by the trial solution in the sixth step.  The Metropolis’s criterion is given as [Pham and

where PSA is the acceptance probability of the trial solution, x and f(x) are respectively the current 
optimal solution and its OFV.  Similarly, x’ and f(x’) are respectively the trial solution and the 
correspondent OFV, Te is a control parameter to analogy the temperature in physical world.  
Note that the initial guess is forthrightly set as the current optimum.   
The fifth step is to check the obtained solution whether satisfies the stopping criteria or not.  
The stopping criterion is chosen as if the absolute difference between the two OFVs obtained at 
two consecutive temperatures is less than 10-6 four times successively.  If the new trial solution 
meets the stopping criterion, the SA-MF is terminated.  Otherwise, the algorithm will continue 
generating the new trial solution in the six step. 
3. Synthetic homogeneous and isotropic unconfined aquifer 
Four unknown variables: the source location of x and y coordinates, pumping rate, and 
pumping period are considered for solving the problem of pumping source information estimation.  
Note that SA-MF determines the source location right at the center of the finite difference grid.  
Four scenarios are considered in this study.  Scenario 1 is designed to verify the minimum 
 5
less than 170 minutes based on the calculation using Theis solution [Todd and Mays, 2005].  All 
the nodal points are considered as the suspicious pumping source locations except those meshes 
containing the observation wells.  The upper bounds for the pumping rate and pumping period 
are set as 1000.0 CMD and 120.0 minutes, respectively, and the lower bounds are both zero.  
The NS, NT, initial temperature, and RTe are chosen as 20, 10, 5, and 0.8, respectively.  All initial 
guesses in the case studies are given by random number generator.

4. Results and discussion 
(1) Required number of measured heads  
The purpose of this scenario is to explore the required number of measured heads in 
identifying the pumping source information in a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer site.  
Mathematically, at least four measured drawdowns are needed to solve those four unknowns.  
Eight cases are designed to investigate the influence of the number of measured drawdowns on 
the results of pumping source estimation.  Four measured heads are used to estimate the 
pumping source information in cases 1-1 to 1-4 while five measured heads are used in cases 1-5 
to 1-8.  The analyzed results using four observations with different allocation of the observation 
wells are shown in Table 2.  The estimated pumping locations are correctly determined at (495 
m, 495 m) in cases 1-1, 1-2 and 1-4.  Yet, the estimated location of (485 m, 505 m) in case 1-3 is 
incorrect.  In cases 1-1, 1-2, and 1-4, the estimated pumping rates are respectively 200.99, 
216.22, and 198.92 CMD and the estimated pumping periods are 54.22, 43.98, and 59.57 minutes, 
 7
and 60.24 minutes.  The largest relative errors are respectively 3.65% in the estimated pumping 
rate and -9.28% in estimated pumping rate in case 2-30 as Er is 3 cm.

number of observation wells should be three at least for estimating the pumping source 
information.

5. Concluding remarks 
A new approach, SA-MF, is developed based on a three-dimensional groundwater flow, 
MODFLOW-2000, and SA for solving the pumping source identification problem.  The SA is 
first employed to randomly generate the trial solutions, i.e., pumping source location, pumping 
rate, and pumping period and then the MODFLOW-2000 is employed to simulate the hydraulic 
heads at the observation wells.  Four scenarios are designed to test the performance of SA-MF 
on the homogeneous, heterogeneous aquifer systems.  Four conclusions can be drawn as
