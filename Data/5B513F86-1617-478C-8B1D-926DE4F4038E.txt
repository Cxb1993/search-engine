Abstract 
Time constraints related issues are unavoidable tasks in wafer fabrications especially for 
back-end copper-interconnect process while the wafers are processed through sets of continuous 
operations associate with various time constraints. We shall address ourselves to capacity 
planning in order to eradicate the difficulties of sequential time constraints. This study proposed a 
queuing approach capacity planning procedure to calculate the required capacity level ensuring 
pre-defined target yield which could be achieved. The workstations with time constraint are 
modeled as GI/G/m queuing network, and the analysis of probabilities of wafers exceeding queue 
time is adopted to determine the required capacity. Furthermore, virtual customers and were 
introduced into the model to adjust system service rate to character the machine failure. Moreover, 
a concept of suppositional machine is proposed to represent the batch/un-batch operations.

二、 報告內容 
 
1. Introduction 
Time constraint (TC) is a time window set between two specific operations to prevent undesirable 
copper film oxidation or fluorine precipitation on the wafer surface [4, 7]. In the back-end 
process, TC can be observed by sets of continuous processes which is named as STC (Sequential 
Time Constraints) in particular. These time windows in the back-end will be squeezed 
significantly, especially in the copper-interconnect process. The issues of STC are more 
complicated than of TC because it can not be resolved by controlling the WIP level. Furthermore, 
the solutions for issues of sequential time constraints could cover which of single TC. 
Previous studies have indicated that effective capacity planning is the foundation for effectively 
managing time constraints [1, 4, 7]. The capacity planning models refer to issues of TC will 
concentrate on how many protective capacities should be established for controlling the queue 
time. In semiconductor fabrication, queuing models have generally been applied for capacity 
planning [2, 3, 8]. However, the factors including reentry flow line, varied product mix, unstable 
machines, and batch processing, would increase the complexity of the system and aggrandize the 
Step2. Calculate the Parameters of the System 
In this step, the mean service time(τj), service time variation(Csj2), and arrival rate(λj) of each 
workstation are calculated through equations developed by Whitt in 1983 [9]. To solve the 
phenomenon of reentry to the production line, the parts of different production steps of individual 
product classes have to be regarded as different types of customers at each workstation. 
Step.3 The Initial Capacity Determination 
In this section, the minimum capacity that can meet the system’s basic requirement is determined, 
which is defined as “initial capacity” (mj). The initial capacity would be the smallest integer m 
that is greater than the arrival rate divided by the service rate, and can be presented as follows: 
⎣ ⎦ 1+= jjjm τλ  (2)
Step4. Adjust mean service time and service time variation 
In this work, virtual customers, whose arrival rate and mean service time will be 
1/(MTTR+MTBF) and MTTR respectively, are introduced to characterize the behavior of 
machine failure. Furthermore, a concept of suppositional machine which processed batched 
customers is proposed to solve the issues of batch-serial processing.

Step5. Compute the variation of inter-arrival time 
After mean arrival rate, adjusted mean service time, and SCV of service time are obtained, the 
SCV of inter-arrival time can be calculated based on the equations proposed by Whitt in 1993 
[10].

availability. Schoemig has pointed out the downtimes frequency had a significant impact on variability while the availability of the 
machines was fixed (Schoemig, 1999). The downtime duration, hence, must be considered in the modification of machine failure. 
The purpose of this paper, thus, is to develop a capacity planning model with sequential time constraints by applying GI/G/m queuing 
model. Through the target yield (ratio of non-exceeding time constraint, Ye) set by managers, the model could calculate how much 
capacity of each workstation was required to achieve the goal. Furthermore, a novel scheme which applying both of availability and 
downtime duration was proposed to address machine breakdown. By this approach, the impact of downtime duration and downtime 
frequency at fixed machine availability can be observed clearly. Moreover, the impacts of different ways and dispatching rule for 
handling wafers exceeded time constraints will be discussed. 
 
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
There are many studies addressed queuing models applied for capacity planning (Adersson and Olsson, 1998, Chen et al., 1988, Hung 
and Leachman, 1996, Leachman and Carmon, 1992). According to Lazowska, queuing network models can be expected to be accurate 
within 90~95% for throughput rates estimation and within 70~90% for cycle time estimation separately (Lazowska et al., 1984). These 
factors have always played as important roles in production systems (Chung and Huang, 2002). However, many unreasonable 
assumptions existed in conventional queuing models, for example, no server failure was assumed. In a manufacturing system, the 
behavior of machine failure will be a critical factor in capacity allocation (Uzsoy et al., 1992). 
To address machine failure, many researches have strived to modify the queuing models. Louw and Page proposed a cycle time 
estimation model using Queuing Theory and modified GI/G/m queuing model by applying machine availability (Louw and Page, 
2004). Mitrany and Avi-Itzhak have proposed a multi-server queuing system with service interruptions based on M/M/s queuing 
model and modified by using the Markov-Chain (Mitrany and Avi-Itzhak, 1968). Hopp has proposed a queuing model with server 
failure which modified by machine availability and MTTR at the same time (Hopp, 1996). However, this model only addressed single 
machine in the system, it was too simple to present complicated environments. These studies on machine failure, the duration of 
downtimes either was not taken into account, or was too complicated for practical applications. 
There were many studies discussed capacity planning to solve issues of time constraints. Robinson and Giglio proposed a capacity 
planning methodology based on M/M/c queuing scheme to solve the time constraint between the wet etch and furnace operations 
(Robinson and Giglio, 1999). They calculated the rework probability and recomputed the required capacity of the wet etch workstation. 
In this model, however, they did not consider the capacity of the furnace operation which directly influenced the probability of rework. 
Fundamentally, it should take a good planning on succeeding workstation for solving issues of time constraints. 
Tu and Liou developed a capacity determination model based on GI/G/c queuing approach to address time constraints with batch 
processing (Tu and Liou, 2006). They determined required capacity of furnace workstation based on length of time constraint. 
Furthermore, the relationship among the over time constraint probability machine utilization, and length of time constraint was 
discussed. In this study, however, issues in the back-end were not addressed. Machines were assumed no failure occurred; this could 
result in inaccuracy of capacity allocation. 
Capacity allocation is the critical for conquering time constraints, hence, capacity planning must be considered first. For the back-end 
of wafer manufacturing, it is important to develop a capacity determination model with time constraints and a novel approach to 
address machine failure. 
 
 
3. CAPACITY DETERMINATION MODEL FOR SEQUENTIAL TIME CONSTRAINTS 
 
In this section, the capacity determination model for the back-end of wafer fabrication with sequential time constraints will be 
described. As stated above, there are many ways to handle the wafers which exceeded time constraints. Given a noticeable mark is the 
most common way among them, moreover, it has the lowest impact on capacity allocation. Therefore, the basic model was based on 
the way of given a noticeable mark on the wafers which exceeded time constraints. 
The capacity determination model proposed by this work applies the GI/G/m queuing model to solve the sequential time constraints 
problem. The objective of this model is to establish necessary capacity level that enables managers to ensure the target yield.  
 
 
3.1 The Logic of Capacity Determination Model 
 
Figure 1 illustrates a queuing system with time constraint. It reveals the product queue time could not exceed the time window. In the 
queuing model, the probability function P(W> x) represents the probability of a customer waits longer than a time period x (Whitt, 
1993.) Let x equal queue time limit, P(W>x) indicates the probability of wafers exceed the time constraint. Furthermore, if the number

C39-4 
probability would be getting greater and greater (Tu and Liou, 2006). Managers would set an acceptable target yield instead of perfect 
ratio. The initial step of this model would be setting an expected target yield (Ye) for whole system. It represents that mangers expect 
the ratio of lots have exceeded TC could be controlled under this target. Then, this target will be decomposed to be stage targets of 
each product at each workstation. 
This model assumed that within the sequential time constraints system, the target yield of each product will be the same. Based on the 
visiting times of time constraint machines of products on their production routing, the stage yield of product f (Yf) could be calculated. 
The equation is given below:

Step2. Calculate the Parameters of the System 
In this step, the mean service time, service time variation, and arrival rate of each workstation are calculated. To solve the 
phenomenon of reentry production line, the parts of different production step of individual product classes have to be regarded as 
different type of customers at each workstation. The detailed process is stated as follows: 
 
Step2.1 Aggregating mean arrival rate 
The first step of parameters calculation is aggregating arrival rates of individual product into the mean arrival rate (λj) of the 
workstation. The formula is represented as follows.

Step2.2 Aggregating mean service time and service time variation 
After mean arrival rate was accumulated, the service time and squared coefficient of variation (SCV) of service of individual products 
also have to be aggregated into mean service time (τj) and SCV of service time (C2sj) of the workstation. Follows are the equations for 
aggregation:

Step.3 The Loading Capacity Determination 
In this section, the minimum capacity that can meet system’s basic requirement was determined, which was defined as “loading 
capacity”. From the definition of Queuing Theory, the traffic intensity (ρ) must be smaller than one to keep the steady-state of the 
system. Therefore, the loading capacity would be the smallest integer m that greater than arrival rate divided by service rate, it can be 
presented as follows:

Step4. Adjust mean service time and service time variation under machine failure 
This section will introduce a novel scheme to reveal the effect of machine failure which adopted availability and downtime duration. 
In this work, the machine failure was regarded as irregular customers whose arrival rate and mean service time will be 
1/(MTTR+MTBF) and MTTR, respectively. We assumed that the machine failures were operation dependent, therefore, it will only

From the procedures proposed in this work, required capacity for sequential time constraints can be determined. The probability of 
wafers over queue time limit can also be controlled below the target set by managers. In the following section, we will discuss the 
influences of different handling methods of wafers which exceed time constraints on capacity allocation. 
 
 
4. DISCUSSION OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
 
The capacity determination model proposed in above section was based on the scenario that given a noticeable mark to the wafers 
when its queue time exceeded time constraint. As stated, different action would influence the capacity allocation. However, should the 
capacity determination model be re-defined or just be adjusted somehow in different scenario? This is an interesting question. Some 
common ways to handle wafers exceeding time constraint were discussed, furthermore, the adjusted model will be proposed in this 
section. 
 
 
4.1 Wafers Exceeding TC Are Set to Be Lower Priority in the Queue 
 
In this scenario, when the wafers have ever exceeded TC in its production route, it will be set lower priority than normal ones. This 
control policy is based on the goal of minimizing total amount of lots ever exceeded time constraints. From some managers’ opinions, 
they would rather prefer wafers exceeded time constraints in each workstation are always the same lots, so that could decrease the 
probability of over TC of other lots. The total amount of lots ever over TC, hence, could be decreased. 
In this policy, the mean arrival rate and mean service time of each workstation would not be changed. Consequently, the probability 
function )( xEWP j >  was not shifted and the proposed model does not have to be modified in this scenario. However, because 
wafers exceeded TC were always the same lots, the accumulation effect of over TC ratio will be disappeared. Hence, the stage yield of 
product should be adjusted. The equation (1) could be modified as follows: 
 
Yf  = Ye (16) 
 
While the target yield is smaller than one, the stage yield of product would smaller than presented before. In this scenario, it will 
require smaller capacity for handling time constraints. 
 
 
4.2 Wafers Exceeding TC Are Set to Be Higher Priority in the Queue 
 
In the back-end of wafer fabrication, if wafers exceeded TC many times, it will lead to the lower yield finally. When the lot has been 
over TC once, it will be processed as soon as possible in the remaining processes. In this scenario, the lot will be set as high priority if 
over TC. This control policy would aspire to minimize the times of over TC of each lot.  
In this scenario, same as above, the parameters were not changed and the probability function was not shifted as well. The capacity 
determination procedure does not to be modified accordingly. Furthermore, the lots wait over queue time limit in each workstation 
were varied, the accumulation effect exists. The capacity allocation procedure would not need to be modified at all. Nevertheless, this 
model will result in the largest amount of lots ever exceeding TC, and the least times of over TC in these lots. In other words, this 
scenario would be the worst case of the model presented in section 3. Even so, the determined capacity could achieve the target yield. 
 
 
4.3 Wafers Exceeding TC Are Scraped 
 
No matter how many times or how long the lots exceed time constraints, the yield of these lots will be impacted. Furthermore, some 
final products have to be scraped after completion. However, this situation could waste the capacity, which was the most precious 
resource in a fab. It will result in lower throughput, longer lead-time, and lower on time delivery. So, managers would scrape WIP 
rather than final products. Some managers were cautious with this problem. They decide to scrape the wafers when over TC to avoid 
the wastes of capacity  
In this scenario, because of some wafers were scraped, input volume were increased to fill the demand. Furthermore, arrival rate of 
each workstation would be varied. The ratio of lots passed to the succeeding workstation would remain the stage yield of the 
workstation. Hence, the equation (2) could be modified to be:
