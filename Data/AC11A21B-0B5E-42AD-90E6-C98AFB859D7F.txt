bandwidth can be found to minimize the latency of DSA with dedicated control 
channels. However, the delay performance of DSA with dedicated control channels is 
more sensitive to the variations of the data lengths than that of DSA with embedded 
control channels. Hence, we conclude that the way of dimensioning the spectrum for 
control frames for DSA in CR networks should be adaptive to the variations of the 
traffic characteristics and the number of users. 
 
In the third part, we propose a concurrent transmission MAC protocol for enhancing 
throughput and avoiding spectrum sensing in CR. For CR network, a fundamental 
issue is how to identify the spectrum opportunities. First, each CR node determines 
whether there exists transmission opportunities on unlicensed bands. If not, this node 
will find other opportunity on licensed bands. Thus, increasing the opportunities of 
concurrent transmissions in unlicensed bands can reduce the overhead of wide-band 
sensing. In this topic, based on the carrier sensing multiple access protocol, we 
propose a novel concurrent transmissions MAC (CT-MAC) protocol to identify the 
possibility of establishing the second link in the presence of the first link in the 
unlicensed band. In addition to reducing the overhead of wide-band sensing, the 
proposed CT-MAC scheme can enhance overall throughput and is backward 
compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
 
In the fourth part, we focus on spatial coexistence of infrastructure-based and ad hoc 
connections for cognitive radio systems. Through wide-band spectrum sensing, CR 
can identify the opportunity of reusing the frequency spectrum of other wireless 
systems. To save time and energy of wide-band spectrum, we investigate to what 
extent a CR system incorporating the location awareness capability can establish a 
scanning-free region where a peer-to-peer ad hoc network can overlay on an 
infrastructure-based network. Based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision 
avoidance (CSMA/CA) medium access control (MAC) protocol, the concurrent 
transmission probability of a peer-to-peer connection and an infrastructure-based 
connection is computed. It is shown that the frequency band of the legacy system can 
be reused up to 45% by the overlaying cognitive ad hoc network when CR users have 
the location information of the primary and secondary users.

One of key challenges for QoS provisioning in CR networks is the spectrum handoff
issue. When the higher priority primary users (PUs) appear in the channel occupied
by the secondary user again, the secondary users need to stop transmission and resume
the unfinished data in the suitable channel. Clearly, the occurrence of spectrum handoff
increases the transmission latency for the secondary users. For example, when supporting
Voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service, the maximum allowable transmission latency
is required to be less than 20 msec [1]. In this case, multiple spectrum handoffs may cause
serious QoS issue when providing VoIP service to the secondary CR users.
In general, spectrum handoff mechanisms can be categorized into three types: (1)
statistics-based; (2) proactive sensing-based; and (3) reactive sensing-based spectrum
handoff mechanisms. For the statistics-based spectrum handoff, secondary users period-
ically observe each channel to obtain the channel usage statistics. Then, each secondary
transmitter predetermines the sequence of target channels for spectrum handoff before
transmitting data frames. For the proactive sensing-based spectrum handoff, a secondary
user is equipped with two transceivers in which one transceiver is for transmitting and
the other transceiver is for searching the idle channels before the preemption event from
the primary user does not occurred. For the reactive sensing-based spectrum handoff,
channel search procedures are performed only right after the primary user appears in the
occupied channel.
In this paper, from a viewpoint of queuing network we study how to model reac-
tive sensing-based spectrum handoff in CR networks. Compared to other two types of
spectrum handoffs, the searched channels according to reactive sensing-based spectrum
handoff is more reliable. Nevertheless, the reactive sensing-based spectrum handoff needs
additional sensing time to search channels. Furthermore, extra control channels are
required to notify the corresponding receiver about the selected target channel.
The main contribution of this paper is to propose a preemptive resume priority (PRP)
M/G/1 queuing network to model the proposed spectrum handoff protocol and charac-
terize the effects of multiple spectrum handoffs. In this model, PUs have the preemptive
priority to interrupt the transmission of SUs. Meanwhile, the preempted secondary users
are designed to resume the unfinished transmission, instead of retransmitting the whole
frame. Noteworthily, this model can handle the case when the preempted secondary
users need to change channel. Based on the three key features, the behavior of spectrum
handoff can be elaborated exactly.

• Because the single-hop networks are considered (i.e., each user can reach other user
with one-hop fashion), only one user can transmit at any time instant on each
channel.
• The first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheduling discipline is adopted to arrange the trans-
mission sequences among the secondary users accessing the same channel.
• In order to distribute the traffic loads of secondary users over all channels, we assume
each secondary user has a default channel for frame transmission. When having data
ready for transmission, the secondary user first informs the intended receiver of its
default channel on the control channel [6]. If its default channel is busy, the secondary
transmitter waits until its default channel becomes idle.
• Each secondary user can use only one channel for frame transmission at any time
instant.
• The secondary users are able to detect the appearance of primary users even though
it is transmitting [7].
B. Reactive Sensing-based Spectrum Handoff Protocol
When a secondary user detects the appearance of primary users by certain primary
detecting mechanism, it will become a preempted transmitter and needs to perform the
reactive sensing-based spectrum handoff procedure as follows.
1) The preempted transmitter must stop current communication within a predefined
duration. According to the IEEE 802.22 standard, the channel closing time [8] is
0.1 seconds.
2) Then, it must notify the preempted receiver of the interrupted event in order to
initiate the spectrum handoff procedures before another predefined time interval,
e.g., 2 seconds channel move time in the IEEE 802.22 standard.
3) Next, the wideband sensing is performed to search the idle channels.
4) After wideband sensing, the preempted transmitter informs the preempted receiver
of the selected target channel on the control channel. Hence, the preempted user
can resume its unfinished transmission on this target channel.
How to decide the target channel based on the wideband sensing outcomes is also a
key issue. If more than one idle channel is found, the preempted transmitter uniformly
selects one target channel from all idle channels. On the other hand, if all channels are
busy, the preempted transmitter prefers to stay on the current channel. In this case, the

• Thirdly, let Xi be the frame length of the type-i users1. Then, its probability density
function (pdf) is denoted by bi(x) with mean E[Xi]. Moreover, The transmission time
of the control frames is ignored in our model.
• Finally, the utilization factor (denoted by ρ) of each channel shall satisfy the follow-
ing constraint:
ρ ≡
3∑
i=1
ρi < 1 . (1)
where ρi is the busy probability resulted from the type-i users on each channel.
Hence, ρ can be interpreted as the busy probability of each channel.
An example of the PRP M/G/1 queuing network with M = 2 for the proposed
spectrum handoff protocol is shown in Fig. 1. The primary arrivals are put into the
high-priority queue, and the secondary and the handoff arrivals are put into the low-
priority queue. Consider the secondary and the handoff user on channel 1. When they
were preempted by the primary users, they change their operating channels to channel
2 if channel 2 is idle. Then, they will become the new handoff users of channel 2 and be
put into the tail of the low-priority queue of channel 2. On the other hand, they will stay
on channel 1 and become the new handoff users of channel 1 if channel 2 is busy. This
case occurs with probability ρ. In this case, they will be inserted into the head of the
1Because the data transmission rate is a constant, the frame length can be regard as the transmission time
equivalently. We use the two terms alternately in this paper.

C. Busy Probability for SUs
Next, we evaluate the busy probability resulted from SUs. For each SU, we consider the
time interval [0, t] on its default channel. There are altogether λ1t newly arriving primary
and λ2t newly arriving secondary users in this interval. Moreover, the total number of
the preempted secondary users is λ2t · p2. Next, we apply the Poisson arrivals see time
average (PASTA) property on the newly arriving PUs [9]. When a PU arrives, it will see
that the channel is used by SUs with probability ρ2. Hence, total λ1t · ρ2 PUs can see
that the channel is used by SUs in this interval. For each PU, it can only preempt one
SU at most when it arrives on a busy channel because only one user can transmit at any
time instant. Thus, the total number of the preempted SUs is also λ1t · ρ2. Hence, we
have λ2t · p2 = λ1t · ρ2. That is,
ρ2 =
λ2
λ1
· p2 = λ2
λ1 + µ2
. (6)
D. Effective Transmission Time for SUs
For each SU, its effective transmission time (denoted by Φ2) is the duration of frame
transmission before the preemption occurs. For example, if a SU finishes its frame trans-
mission without any preemption, the effective transmission time is its whole frame length.
On the other hand, only partial frame can be successfully transmitted to the correspond-
ing receiver for the case that SU is preempted by the PUs. Thus, the effective transmission
time in this case is the length of this partial frame.
Next, we derive the pdf of Φ2 as follows. Let t1 be the inter-arrival time of PUs on
each channel, we have Φ2 = min(t1, X2). Because t1 and X2 follow the exponential
distributions, the pdf of Φ2 can be expressed as follows:
fΦ2(x) = (λ1 + µ2) e
(λ1+µ2)x . (7)
Hence, we have E[Φ2] =
1
λ1+µ2
.
E. Remaining Transmission Time for SUs
Compared to the effective transmission time, the remaining transmission time for each
SU is the duration of the unfinished transmission after its transmission is preempted. Note
that the remaining transmission time is zero if the transmission had not been preempted.
8
F. Effective and Remaining Transmission Time for HUs
The concepts of effective and remaining transmission time for HUs are similar to the
concepts of that for SUs. The effective transmission time for HUs is the duration of
frame transmission between the successive preemptions. On the other hand, the remain-
ing transmission time for HUs is the duration of the unfinished transmission after the
transmission is preempted again. However, because a HU may be preempted many times,
we must answer whether the effective and the remaining transmission time of a HU are
related to its times of preemptions.
This question can be answered by the following observations. For each SU, after it is
preempted, it will become a handoff user of its target channel. Thus, this SU’s remaining
transmission time will become the frame transmission time of the corresponding handoff
user on the selected target channel. According to the discussions in Section IV-E, the
remaining transmission time for SU follows the exponential distribution b2(x). Hence, the
frame transmission time of the handoff user which had been preempted once before also
follows b2(x). Then, we follow the methodologies in Sections IV-D and IV-E to find the
effective and the remaining transmission time of this handoff user, respectively. Finally,
for this handoff user which had been preempted twice, we can show that its remaining
transmission time also follows b2(x) again. The similar arguments can be applied on the
following preemptions.
From the above observations, we can conclude that the remaining transmission time
of each preempted user always follows b2(x). Thus, the frame length of each HU also
follows the exponential distribution b2(x). That is, b3(x) = b2(x). On the other hand,
recall the discussion of the effective transmission time of each SU in Section IV-D, we
can conclude that the effective transmission time of HU (denoted by Φ3) can be expressed
as E[Φ3] =
1
λ1+µ2
.
G. Preemption Probability for HUs
According to the discussions in Section IV-F, we find that the frame length for HU
follows the exponential distribution. Following the methodologies in Section IV-B, we
can derive the preemption probability (denoted by p3) of the HU as p3 =
λ1

J. Numerical Results
Figure 2 shows the preemption probability (p ≡ p2 = p3) over different values of µ2. It
can be expected that p decreases as µ2 increases or λ1 decreases. Note that the simulation
results are shown to match the proposed analytical results quite well. Moreover, the
relationship between p and (λ1, µ2) is shown in Fig. 3. When the service rate of the
secondary users is the lower, the changes of PUs’ traffic load lead to the violent changes
of p. On the other hand, when the traffic load is more heavy, the changes of service rate
also lead to the violent changes of p.
V. Conclusions
This paper focuses on modeling for reactive sensing-based spectrum handoff in CR
networks. We use a preemptive resume priority (PRP) M/G/1 queuing network to model
the spectrum usage behaviors between primary and secondary users and characterize the
effects of multiple spectrum handoffs. Based on this model, we show how to evaluate the
system performance metrics under the assumption of homogeneous traffic loads, i.e., all

Access in Cognitive Radio: Dedicated or
Embedded Control Channel?

Abstract
Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is the key feature of cognitive radio (CR) networks,
but it also poses many new challenges on the medium access control (MAC) design. One of
key challenges is the fact that the secondary CR users can only borrow the licensed spectrum
from the primary users for a short period of time. Hence, unlike many available multi-channel
MAC protocols for ad hoc networks where throughput is the main performance issue, the
DSA protocols in CR networks shall place more emphases on the access latency. Hence, one
fundamental issue arises: how can the spectrum be dimensioned for control channels in order
to minimize the access delay of DSA protocol in CR networks?
In this paper, we provide a comparative study in an analytical manner on the latency
performance of two DSA protocols: 1) dedicated control channel, and 2) embedded dedicated
control channel approaches. Our results show that an optimal ratio of the control channel
bandwidth over the total channel bandwidth can be found to minimize the latency of DSA
with dedicated control channels. However, the delay performance of DSA with dedicated
control channels is more sensitive to the variations of the data lengths than that of DSA with
embedded control channels. Hence, we conclude that the way of dimensioning the spectrum
for control frames for DSA in CR networks should be adaptive to the variations of the traffic
characteristics and the number of users. 1

channels. Section IV presents some numerical results. Finally, we give our concluding
remarks in Section V.
II. CR MAC with Dedicated and Embedded Control Channels
In this paper, the CR MAC protocol is viewed as the carrier sense multiple access
(CSMA)-like MAC protocol with the DSA capability. That is, the transmitter and re-
ceiver can use the control frames, such as request-to-send (RTS) and clear-to-send (CTS),
to negotiate a spectrum for their communication.
Assume that each secondary user has two radio interfaces, where the one is used for
receiving and the other one is used for transmitting. It is assumed that all the secondary
users can know other nodes’ default channels through the channel discovery procedure.
Consider the example as shown in Fig. 1. When secondary user 1 (denoted by SU 1) wants
to transmit data to secondary user 2 (denoted by SU 2), SU 1 switches its transmitting
interface to SU 2’s default channel (CH 3). However, if SU 2’s default channel is busy,
how can SU 1 transmit data to SU 2? SU 1 may firstly find the other idle channels by
wideband sensing. In this example, SU 1 finds channels 1 and 2 are idle. Then, SU 1
notifies SU 2 that its selected channel. As above discussions, there exist two approaches
to achieve the goal of transmitter-receiver negotiation as follows.
A. A CR MAC with Dedicated Control Channels Approach
Consider the dedicated control channels approach. On the dedicated common control
channels, the CR transmitter and receiver exchange the RTS and CTS control frames.
After that, CR nodes can transmit data at the desired licensed channels. With dedicated
control channels, a common communication platform is available and the protocol can be
simplified. However, splitting the total channel bandwidth leads to the control channel
saturation issue [5], thereby degrading the throughput due to the overlong contention
duration. Let Tdata be the data transmission duration, Tc the sum of the contention
duration and the control frames transmission duration. When E[Tdata]
E[Tc]
< 1, the control
channel saturation issue occurs, as shown in Fig. 2.
One way to mitigate the control channel saturation is to increase the control channel
bandwidth. If the control channel bandwidth increases too much, i.e., E[Tdata]
E[Tc]
> 1, the
data channel saturation issue occurs as shown in Fig. 3. In practice, it is hard to
16
Fig. 2. The access delay under the control channel saturation
A. Access Latency With Dedicated Control Channel
Now we discuss how to calculate the average delay of DSA for the CR MAC protocols
with dedicated control channel. Let Pcs and Pds be the saturation probabilities of the
control and data channels, respectively. Both of which can be obtained from Fig. 4 for
a given ratio of control channel bandwidth over data channel bandwidth. With Pcs and
Pds, the average access delay of the CR MAC protocol with dedicated control channel
E[D] can be expressed as
E[D] = PcsE[D|control channel saturation occurs]
+ PdsE[D|data channel saturation occurs] . (1)
Because the probability of the non-saturation event (i.e., E[Tdata]
E[Tc]
= 1) is very small, it is
assumed that Pcs + Pds ' 1 in (1).
1) Delay With Control Channel Saturation: The delay with control channel saturation
can be calculated by the concept of virtual slots [4]. Assume a specific node must wait N (c)
virtual slots before it successfully transmits its RTS frame. Let Tdata be the transmission
time of data packets. From Fig. 2, we can express the conditional average access delay
given that the control channel saturation occurs as follows:
E[D|control channel saturation occurs]
= E[T ]E[N (c)] + E[Tdata] , (2)
where T is the duration of a virtual slot when control channel saturation occurs.
Before a specifical node transmits an RTS frame successfully, there exists three possible
events in each virtual slot. The first one is an empty slot which has probability 1− Ptr,
the second one is that a collided transmission with probability (1− Ps)Ptr, and the last
one is successful transmission with probability PsPtr. Hence, in terms of the durations of
18
Fig. 3. The access delay under the data channel saturation
2) Delay With Data Channel Saturation: Now, we discuss how to calculate the access
delay with data channel saturation. We consider the delay of CR k as shown in Fig. 3.
Firstly, this node waits a duration of CR 1’s control frames transmission time. It spends a
duration of (E[T ]E[N (c)]+ ts), where T is the virtual slot duration; N
(c) is the number of
virtual slots; and ts is defined in (6). Because the data channel saturation occurs, we will
calculate the latency resulted from data frames rather than that resulted from control
frames. Assume a specific node must wait N (d) − 1 virtual slots before it successfully
transmits its data frame, CR k will need further wait a duration of (E[N (d)]− 1)E[Tdata]
before transmitting its own data frame. Thus, the average access delay with data channel
saturation can be expressed as
E[D|data channel saturation occurs]
=
(
E[T ]E[N (c)] + ts
)
+ E[Tdata]E[N
(d)] . (9)
Now, we discuss how to calculate the transmission time of CR 1 on control channel.
Consider the case that any node cannot transmit the control frame successfully, only two
events will occur at each virtual slot. The first one is an empty slot with the probability
of 1−Ptr
1−PsPtr ; the second one is a collided transmission with the probability of
(1−Ps)Ptr
1−PsPtr .
Hence, the average duration of a virtual slot T in this case can be written as
E[T ] =
1− Ptr
1− PsPtrσ +
(1− Ps)Ptr
1− PsPtr tf . (10)
Moreover, given the probability without successful transmissions 1− PsPtr. Thus, there
does not exist any successful transmission until (k + 1)th virtual slots with probability
(1−PsPtr)kPsPtr. Hence, the average number of virtual slots can be expressed as follows:
E[N (c)] =
∞∑
k=0
k(1− PsPtr)kPsPtr . (11)
To calculate E[N (d)], it is assumed that CR k cannot send its control frame until
other (k-1) users had successfully sent theirs control frames. Hence, CR k sends its data
20
where tACK is the transmission time of the ACK frame; DIFS is the DCF-interframe
space, respectively according to the definitions in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol.
Denote Pmatch and Pmismatch as the probabilities of the channel match and mismatch,
respectively. With m candidate channels, it is followed that
Pmatch =
1
m
, and Pmismatch =
m− 1
m
. (17)
Recall that the probability with an empty slot is 1 − Ptr, and the probability with
collided transmission is (1−Ps)Ptr. When considering all the four possible events at each
virtual slot, the average virtual time slot duration E[T ] can be expressed as
E[T ] = (1− Ptr)σ + (1− Ps)Ptrtf
+ PmatchPsPtrtmatch
+ PmismatchPsPtrtmisatch , (18)
where tmismatch, tmatch, Pmatch, and Pmismatch are given by (15), (16), and (17), respectively.
Now, we calculate E[N ] in (14). Consider m candidate channels. For a CR transmitter,
the mismatched events occur until the kth channel attempt with probability:
m− 1

m− 1 . . .
m− k + 1
m− k + 2 ·

. (19)
Before a CR node transmits RTS, it needs to wait a contention duration. Assume RTS
frame cannot be transmitted successfully until N (c) virtual slots are spent. Hence, a node
will undergo kE[N (c)] virtual slots on average if the mismatched events occur until the
kth channel attempt. Thus, E[N ] can be expressed as

Substituting (8), (18) and (20) into (14) for a given value of E[Tdata], one can obtain the
average access delay for embedded control channel .
IV. Numerical Results
In this section, we first show the relation between the delay of dedicated control channel
and the control channel bandwidth ratio. Then we compare the delay performance of the
dedicated control channel E[D] and embedded control channel E[D′] for various user
numbers and data lengths. The related system parameters are listed in Table I. The
basic transmission rate is used in each control channel. In our numerical results, it is
assumed that the data length [7] and the contention period are exponential distribution
[8].

ratio for a CR MAC with dedicated control channels.
C. Effect of Various Data Lengths
Figure 6 compares the delay for CR MAC with dedicated and embedded control
channels under bandwidth ratio 0.2. From the figure, it is shown that the delay is
almost linearly proportional to the mean value of data length in both cases. Furthermore,
because the slope of dedicated case is lager than that of embedded case, the delay for
CR MAC with dedicated control channel is slightly more sensitive to different mean data
lengths than that for embedded case. Hence, the embedded control channel approach is
more suitable for the environment that data length violently varies because its delay has
smaller jitter than that of dedicated control channel approach.

primary link. On the other hand, all nodes have the same right to access the unlicensed
spectrum. Hence, a suitable contention resolution algorithm is necessary to achieve the
objective of intelligent spectrum sharing.
An important issue for CR MAC is to identify the spectrum opportunities. Usually,
each CR node first determines whether there exists transmission opportunities on unli-
censed bands. If so, this node will concurrently transmit together with the first link. If
not, this node will dynamically find other opportunity on licensed bands by wide-band
sensing. Thus, increasing the concurrent transmission opportunities on unlicensed bands
can reduce the overhead of wide-band sensing.
In the literature, recent research on MAC protocols for the multihop ad-hoc network
on unlicensed band, the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based MAC protocol is
the most popular one. However, the CSMA-based MAC protocol induces the hidden
node and exposed node problems as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The hidden
node problem occurs because node C out of the interference range of the transmitter
can potentially cause frame collisions. On the other hand, node C within the range of
the transmitter is prohibited from accessing the medium unnecessarily, which is called
the exposed node problem. The exposed node problem yield spectrum inefficiency issue
because it decreases the concurrent transmission opportunities. Moreover, although the
concept of virtual carrier sensing is proposed in IEEE 802.11 MAC to solve the hidden
node issue, the exposed node problem is remained open. Therefore, the focus of this
paper is mainly on solving the exposed node problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel concurrent transmissions MAC (CT-MAC) scheme
for a wireless ad hoc network based on the CSMA MAC protocol. Although the existing
concurrent transmission MAC protocols can solve the exposed node problem, these pro-
tocols also induce other problems, such as the virtual-carrier exposed node problem [1],

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce some problems
induced from the CSMA MAC protocol and review some solutions of these problems.
Section III presents the proposed CT-MAC protocol. Then, some simulation results are
given in Section III-E. Finally, we give our concluding remarks in Section IV.
II. Background and Related Work
In following discussion, we consider the network topology as shown in Fig. 3 where each
node can only communicate with its neighbors. First, we review some problems induced
from the existing MAC protocols. Then, we survey some solutions of these problems in
the recent literatures. However, these solutions cannot solve all problems perfectly.
A. Physical Carrier Sensing and Virtual Carrier Sensing
CSMA MAC protocol will face the well-known problems of hidden node and exposed
node in wireless ad hoc networks. According to the CSMA MAC protocol, each node
senses the channel before transmitting data. We refer to such sensing as physical carrier
sensing. Therefore, we call these two problems the physical-carrier hidden node problem
and the physical-carrier exposed node problem, respectively.
Because physical carrier sensing may be unreliable in the wireless channel, the MACA
protocol introduced the concept of virtual carrier sensing [6]. The basic principles of
virtual carrier sensing are briefly introduced in the following. When a node intends to
transmit data to another node, it first broadcast a Request-To-Send (RTS) frame. After
receiving the RTS frame, the target receiver replies a Clear-To-Send (CTS) frame. After
the CTS frame is received by the transmitter, it can send out the data. It the data
successfully reach the destination, the receiver will respond an acknowledgement (ACK)
frame. This RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK four-way handshaking procedures can achieve the
goal of carrier sensing without involving physical carrier sensing. Therefore, it is called

transmissions of B → A and C → D are supposed to be able to coexist in the considered
scenario, but the MAC protocols discussed so far, including physical and virtual carrier
sensing, cannot achieve the goal of concurrent transmissions.
Now we discuss the exposed node issue induced by the RTS/CTS handshaking mech-
anism. As illustrated in Fig. 5, suppose that the link of A → B has been established
based on the MACA protocol, as long as a node hear a CTS from other node, it will
not be allowed to transmit any data in order to prevent the hidden node issue shown in
Fig. 1. As a result, node C cannot reply a CTS frame to node D. Hence, the concurrent
transmission opportunity of links A→ B and D → C becomes wasted. In this case, node
C is exposed to node B. We call this situation the exposed node problem due to virtual
carrier sensing.
C. Existing Concurrent Transmission MAC Protocols
In this subsection, we discuss the concurrent transmission MAC protocols that can
solve the exposed node issue in wireless ad hoc networks. Now we give an overview on
the concurrent transmission MAC protocols with physical and virtual carrier sensing
available.
1) Medium Access via Collision Avoidance with Enhanced Parallelism (MACA-P) [4]:
To address the exposed node issue, an enhanced version of the MACA protocol, called the
MACA-P protocol, was proposed in [4]. The key idea of this protocol is to introduce an
extra gap between the RTS/CTS frames and the subsequent DATA frames in addition
to the short inter-frame space (SIFS) of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. This extra
32
3) Enhanced-MAC (E-MAC) [3]: By exploiting the fragmentation mechanism of the
IEEE 802.11 MAC scheme, the enhanced-MAC (E-MAC) scheme was proposed to in-
crease the concurrent transmission opportunity [3]. According to the IEEE 802.11 MAC
scheme, a long packet can be partitioned into many small fragments, each of which is
followed an ACK. The basic idea of the E-MAC scheme is to synchronize its transmission
with the segments of the existing long packet. Then, the virtual-carrier hidden and
exposed node problems can be solved.
However, this solution has some disadvantages. First, E-MAC must fragment the
packets from the upper layers, which in only suitable for a larger-sized packet network.
However, as mentioned previously, about 50% packets are smaller than 100 bytes in
the Internet. Second, because the size of the last segment is a variable, it is necessary to
monitor the NAV of the last segment from its previous segment. However, it is difficult for
the second link to overhearing the DATA segment of the other nodes and transmit its own
data simultaneously except that there are multiple radio interfaces. Third, referring to
Fig. 5, if the synchronization duration between the RTS and parallel-CTS frame between
nodes D and C is longer than the SIFS duration, node D in the second link may enter
the backoff procedure after a timeout duration. Thus, the RTS frame is sent again by
node D.
III. The Proposed CT-MAC Protocol
The proposed CT-MAC protocol aims to solve the hidden and exposed node problems
with physical and virtual carrier sensing subject to the constraint of being compatible
with the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. The basic idea in the proposed CT-MAC protocol is
described as follows. First, each node identifies whether or not a concurrently transmitted
link can be established based on the observations from (1) physical carrier sensing; (2)
virtual carrier sensing; and (3) the Destination Address (DA)/Source Address (SA) fields
in the overheard RTS or CTS. With the DA/SA fields in the RTS frame (or the DA field
of the CTS frame), a node can determine if the current existing link are able to support
concurrent transmissions by comparing the address with the results obtained from the
CT-neighbor discovery procedure. Furthermore, with these observations, each CT node
can identify its transmission directions (i.e., whether it can “transmit” or “receive”) in
the concurrent transmission link.
In the following, we develop a CT-MAC protocol based on these observations. Figure

is an exposed node with virtual carrier sensing, of which transmissions are prohibited
due to hearing the CTS frame.
The proposed CT-MAC protocol can solve the exposed node problem with virtual
carrier sensing as illustrated in Fig. 6. Specifically, in this case the proposed CT-MAC
protocol can help the exposed node successfully function as a receiver for the second link.
In the figure, during the setup process of link A→ B, node A sends an RTS frame, and
then B responds the CTS frame. Since node C looks up the DA field of the overheard
CTS frame, it can know who is the transmitter of the first link. By checking the CT-
neighbors list, node C can decide whether both the transmitter and receiver of the first
link are CT-nodes. Moreover, being aware that it has a CT neighbor within two hops,
node A will not immediately transmit DATA to B, but will wait for a duration of Tw. This
waiting duration is equal to the sum of SIFS (TSIFS), the monitoring time (Tm) and the
transmission time (TRTR) of the Ready-to-Receive (RTR) frame. Note that the monitoring
time is the duration for identifying the channel state. Because only overhearing the CTS
frame from node B but no RTS in an idle channel after the duration Tm, node C knows
that itself is an exposed node. Hence, it sends an RTR frame to node D during TRTR
in order to request the data from D. This RTR frame should record the allowing data
length in order to synchronize ACKs between the first and second links. Notice that the
NAV value (Tnav) in RTS of A is equal to 3TSIFS + TCTS + Tw + TDATA + TACK where
T♦ means the transmission time of the ♦ type frame.
C. Solution to the Hidden Node Problem with Virtual Carrier Sensing
Now let us discuss how the proposed CT-MAC protocol can solve the the hidden node
problem with virtual carrier sensing. Figure 4 shows an example with this problem. In
the figure, link B → A is already established. Thus, from the RTS/CTS handshaking
procedure, node C only overhears the RTS frame from node B but no CTS frame. Hence,
node C can have an opportunity to transmit data without interfering the first link.

node A does not reply CTS.
D. Discussion
Here we refine our proposed CT-MAC protocol to handle a special case. In our proposed
CT-MAC protocol, as described in Section III-C, if a node only overhears the RTS frame
but no CTS frame when the channel is busy, it can be a transmitter in the second link.
However, this rule may not be always true. For example, consider the network topology
shown in Fig. 3. Since the first link E → F is already established, node D can overhear
the RTS frame sent from node E to node F . Assume that nodes C and F simultaneously
send RTS and CTS to nodes D and E, respectively. In this case, collision occurs at node
D. Thus, node D fails to receive any frames. From the standpoint of node D, it receives
RTS but no CTS and senses a busy channel due to the transmission of link E → F .
Therefore, node D may mistakenly believe that it can be the transmitter of the second
link according to our proposed CT-MAC protocol described in Section III-C. However, the
links E → F and D → C cannot transmit concurrently because node D’s transmission
will interfere node F ’s reception.
To resolve this issue, we refine the concurrent transmission rule as follows. If the DA
field in the overheard RTS frame indicates that the receiver of the first link is its one-hop
neighbor, a node is forbidden to be a transmitter in the second link. For example, by
observing the DA field in the RTS frame of node E, node D knows that the receiver (F ) of
the first link is also its neighbor. According to the above refined concurrent transmission
rule, node D will not transmit data in order not to interfere the existing link. Similarly,
we can also observe the SA filed in the RTS frame and the DA field in the CTS frame
to identify whether the neighboring node is a potential transmitter/receiver.
E. Numerical Results
We perform simulations based on ns-2 in the double ring topology as shown in Fig.
8. Each inner node can communicate with its neighbors. However, each outer node can

these features, the proposed CT-MAC protocol can enhance the overall throughput of a
cognitive ad hoc network and avoid the time- and energy-consuming wide-band sensing.
Other advantages can be summarized as follows:
• overcome the hidden and exposed node issues with physical and virtual carrier
sensing;
• backward compatible with the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol;
• suitable to concurrently transmit various sizes of packets with higher flexibility.
There are some interesting open issues. So far the proposed concurrent transmission
MAC protocol has not taken into account of the effect of location awareness. In the future,
we aim to incorporate the impact of location awareness into the concurrent transmission
MAC protocol design is also an interesting research direction [7].

on the related research issues in a CR system. To establish a harmless communication link in the
presence of the existing legacy systems, a CR user is required to:
1) sense wide-band spectrums [7]–[9];
2) identify the primary user’s spectrum usage in terms of locations and time; [10]–[14];
3) realize the spectrum sharing opportunities between the primary and secondary users by
adjusting the transmission parameters accordingly [15]–[20].
However, wide-band spectrum sensing requires sophisticated and energy-consuming signal pro-
cessing [16].
Instead of developing another efficient spectrum sensing technique, in this paper, we discuss a
challenging but fundamental issue – Can CR users effectively identify the available spectrum holes
without wide-band spectrum sensing? Intuitively, when the secondary CR users are far away from
the primary user of the legacy system, both CR and the primary users can concurrently transmit
their data without causing interference. If a CR device knows the region where it can concurrently
transmit with the primary user, a CR system does not need to rely on the time- and energy-
consuming wide-band spectrum scanning to detect the spectrum holes. In addition, it is clear that
concurrent transmission can enhance the overall throughput. In this sense, identifying concurrent
transmission opportunity shall be given a higher priority over spectrum sensing for a CR user.
The next important issue is how to identify the concurrent transmission region where CR users
will not cause interference to the legacy wireless systems. In this paper, we propose to utilize the
location awareness techniques to help CR user identify the concurrent transmission opportunity. Our
specific goal is to dimension the concurrent transmission region where CR devices can establish
an overlaying ad hoc network on top of an infrastructure-based legacy system. The overlaying ad
hoc network can be considered an important application for CR devices because it can reuse the
underutilized spectrum and significantly improve the efficiency of the frequency band. A possible
example is that a group of users who want to share data with each others may require to setup
such the overlaying ad hoc network. Suppose that their communication devices only can access the
licensed spectrum. Obviously, all of them may not want to pay just for a temporary data transfer.
To solve this situation, an overlaying ad hoc link in the presence of primary connection may
be the network architecture that can satisfy their requirement. We believe this network topology
will become more and more attractive because of the spectrum scarcity as the advance of the
42
same frequency spectrum simultaneously. The impacts of shadowing on this coexistence probability
are investigated in Section IV. The physical (PHY) and MAC cross-layer performance analysis is
provided in Section V. Section VI shows the numerical results. The concluding remarks are given
in Section VII.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND DEFINITION
Figure 1 illustrates a hybrid ad hoc/infrastructure-based network consisting of two CR devices
(MS1 and MS2) and a primary user MS3. Assume that the secondary CR users MS1 and MS2 try to
make a peer-to-peer connection, and the primary user MS3 has been connected to the base station
(BS) or access point (AP) of the legacy infrastructure-based system. In the figure, MS1, MS2 and
MS3 are located at (r1, θ1), (r2, θ2) and (r3, θ3), respectively; the coverage area of the base station
is piR2. All the primary and secondary users stay fixed or hardly move.
We assume the CR devices can perform the positioning technique to acquire their relative or
absolute position by using GPS or detecting the signal strength from the BSs of legacy systems
[26]–[31]. The location information is broadcasted by using the geographical routing protocols
[32]–[34]. Although both the positioning and geographical routing may waste time and consume
the energy, they have no need to be processed for every data transmission. They are only performed
when a new node joins or the node changes its position. Furthermore, with the help of upper layers,
the location information is already stored in the device. Therefore, compared to the spectrum sensing
at every transmission, we believe the additional energy consumption and memory space due to the
positioning and location update is relatively small. The overhead and optimal reserved resources
for acquiring the location information are beyond the scope of this paper, but the relative research
works have been studied in [35], [36].
Based on the CSMA/CA MAC protocol, multiple users contend the channel, and only one mobile
station within the coverage of the base station can establish an infrastructure-based communication
link at any instant. To set up an extra peer-to-peer ad hoc connection in the same frequency band of
the primary user, the secondary users not only require to ensure that the current infrastructure-based
link quality cannot be degraded but also has to win the contentions between other feasible secondary
users. Here, we consider that both primary and secondary users have identical transmit power. It is
reasonable to assume only one secondary user can be established a link after the contention at one

radii of r3z

where z′i = zi · (h2ms/h2bs) and z′a = (1/za) · (h2ms/h2bs). From (11), the concurrent transmission
region R(d)CT in the downlink case is shown in Fig. 3. The criterion (d13 > r3z

region outside the circle centered at MS3 with a radius of r3z

i , while the criterion (d12 < r2z

yields the region inside the circle centered at MS2 with radius r2z

With the values of r+ and r−, R(d)CT can be calculated in the following two cases:

and vice versa. Besides, different from the pure infrastructure network, both the locations of the
transmitter and receiver in an ad hoc link are random.
Instead of calculating the maximum number of ad hoc links, we suggest constructive procedures
enabling CR devices to establish ad hoc links in the presence of an infrastructure transmission. The
detailed procedures are summarized as follows:
1) Consider a network in which all the primary and secondary users are fixed, and the CR device
can learn the locations of its receiver and neighbors by the routing mechanism [17]. Here,
we assume that l ad hoc links have been established and coexisted with the infrastructure
link at the same time. Before establishing a new ad hoc connection, the CR device has to
overhear the channel and memorizes the locations of all the existing transmitters.
2) With the location information, the new CR device starts evaluating the concurrent transmission
region RCT . The device should consider the interference from the infrastructure link as well
as other existing ad hoc links, and vice versa. Denote the indices {p,m, n, k} as the primary
user, the transmitter and receiver of the new ad hoc link, and the transmitter of other existing
ad hoc link, respectively. Using similar procedures in deriving (5), the three conditions in the
infrastructure uplink case can be written by

other ad hoc connections by the primary user and other secondary CR users.

We define the reliability of uplink concurrent transmission F (u)CT (ξ) as the probability that, in the
region RCT , a CR device can successfully establish an ad hoc link in the presence of the primary
user’s uplink transmission subject to the shadowing effect. That is,
F
(u)
CT (ξ) = P
{(
SIR
(u)
i (ξ30, ξ10) > zi
)
∩(
SIR(u)a (ξ12, ξ32) > z
) |MS1 ∈ R(u)CT} . (34)
Note that F (u)CT (ξ) = 1 when shadowing is not considered. Substituting (28) and (29) into (34), we
can obtain
F
(u)
CT (ξ) = P
{(
ξ30 − ξ10 > 10 log10(zi(
r3

)
∩(
ξ12 − ξ32 > 10 log10(za(
d12
d23
)α)
)
|MS1 ∈ R(u)CT
}
. (35)
Assume that ξij have the same standard deviation for all i and j and let ξ
(u)
i = ξ30 − ξ10, ξ(u)a =
ξ12 − ξ32. Then, ξ(u)i and ξ(u)a become Gaussian random variables with N(0, 2σξ). Hence, it is
followed that
F

CT (ξ) = P

Following similar procedures in the uplink case, we can also obtain the reliability of downlink

{(

Then, we evaluate the total throughput performance of the concurrent transmission in the hybrid
infrastructure and overlaying CR-based ad hoc network. Here, we assume NCR CR devices and N
non-CR devices using the same frequency band in the coverage of a base station. Since the CR
device can establish an ad hoc connection without interfering the existing infrastructure link, the
total throughput of such a hybrid network SCT is independently contributed by the two links. The
throughput of the infrastructure link and the CR-based ad hoc connection are denoted by Si and
Sa, respectively. The total throughput SCT then can be expressed as
SCT = Si(N) + Sa(NCRPCT ) . (40)
Since N non-CR devices contend for data transmission to the base station, the throughput of
infrastructure-based link Si is the same as (38). As for the throughput of the cognitive overlaying
ad hoc connection Sa, it is similar to Si, but the number of contending stations changes to NCRPCT
because only NCRPCT CR devices have the opportunity to establish the connection. Although the
secondary user employs the location information to replace the carrier sensing in the CSMA/CA,
it still needs to wait for the DIFS and SIFS durations and makes sure if other secondary users
are transmitting data. Once the user finds another one establishes a link, it still has to freeze its
backoff counter and resumes the backoff count down after the link is complete, just like what the
CSMA/CA MAC does. Therefore, all the throughput calculations for the secondary users is similar
to that for the CSMA/CA MAC protocol. The only discrepancy between the two systems is merely
the number of contending stations. Because only the secondary users within the same concurrent
transmission region have the right to access the spectrum, the number of users for the overlaying
ad hoc network is the function of the coexistence probability.
VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we first investigate the concurrent transmission probability of the infrastructure and
overlaying CR-based ad hoc network. Then we apply the proposed cross-layer analytical model to
evaluate the total throughput performance in this hybrid network. Figure 1 illustrates the considered
network topology, where MS1, MS2 and MS3 are the CR-based ad hoc transmitter, receiver and
infrastructure primary user, respectively. The stations MS2 and MS3 are, respectively, located at
(r2,−pi/2) and (r3, pi/2), where r2 and r3 are the distances between the base station to MS2 and

Fig. 5. The concurrent transmission probability P (u)CT versus the CR-based ad hoc receiver’s location as the infrastructure uplink
user MS3 is located at (50, pi/2), where r2 is the distance between the base station and ad hoc link receiver MS2.
On the other hand, when MS3 moves away from the base station, its uplink SIR decreases due to
the weaker signal strength and thus yields a lower P (u)CT . Hence, an optimal primary user’s location
can be found in the sense of maximizing the uplink concurrent transmission probability P (u)CT .
Figure 5 shows the impact of MS2’s locations on the uplink concurrent transmission probability
P
(u)
CT . As shown in the figure, as the CR-based ad hoc user moves away from the base station,
the concurrent transmission probability monotonically increases from 10% to 50% because the
interference from the infrastructure-based link to the ad hoc connection decreases.
56
Figure 7 shows the impact of CR user MS2’s locations on the downlink concurrent transmission
probability. Similar to Fig. 5, P (d)CT also monotonically increases when CR user MS2 moves away
from the base station. However, comparing Figs. 5 and 7, the uplink’s concurrent transmission
probability is higher than that of the downlink’s. For zi = za = 0 dB and r2 = 100 meters, P
(u)
CT =
49% and P (d)CT = 39%, respectively. This is because in the considered scenario the interference
to the ad hoc user from the infrastructure-based uplink transmission is weaker than that from the
downlink transmission.
C. Effects of Shadowing on the Concurrent Transmission
Figures 8(a) and (b) illustrate the reliability of the concurrent transmissions with various shad-
owing standard deviations versus r3 and r2, respectively. In general, comparing σξ = 6 dB and
σξ = 1 dB, one can find that the larger shadowing variance leads to a lower reliability for both
uplink and downlink concurrent transmissions. For example, in Fig. 8(a), when the primary user’s
distance to the base station r3 in the range of 0 ∼ 100 meters, F (d)CT is larger than 0.9 for σξ = 1
dB, whereas it decreases to 0.6 ∼ 0.7 for σξ = 6 dB. However, when the primary user moves
to the cell edge, the reliability of uplink and downlink concurrent transmissions decreases due to
shadowing and weaker received signal strength. As shown in Fig. 8(a), for σξ = 6 dB, F
(d)
CT and
F
(u)
CT decrease from 0.7 to 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. Since the uplink signal strength is weaker than
the downlink signal, the reliability of uplink concurrent transmission is usually more sensitive to
shadowing effects than downlink concurrent transmission, especially when the primary user is at
the cell edge. In Fig. 8(b), it is shown that, subject to the influence of shadowing, the reliability
of uplink and downlink concurrent transmissions increases when the receiver MS2 of the ad hoc
link approaches to the cell edge. For σξ = 1 dB, F
(u)
CT and F
(d)
CT increase from 0.4 and 0.63 to
0.89 and 0.92 as r2 increases to 100 meters; for σξ = 6 dB F
(u)
CT and F
(d)
CT also increase from
0.29 and 0.4 to 0.54 and 0.62. Clearly, the interference from the primary user to the ad hoc user
becomes weaker when ad hoc users moves away from the base station. As a result, the reliability
of concurrent transmission increases and the shadowing effect on the reliability remains constant
as r2 > 30 meters for σξ = 1 dB and r2 > 60 meters for σξ = 6 dB.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we identified a critical region RCT in which the overlaying cognitive ad hoc users
and the primary user can concurrently transmit data without causing interference to each other. If the
location information of other nodes is available, such a concurrent transmission region can be easily
identified. There are two major advantages of identifying the concurrent transmission opportunity.
First, the overall throughput of the concurrently transmitted data obtained by combining both the
overlaying cognitive ad hoc networks and the legacy infrastructure-based system is much higher
than that of the pure infrastructure-based system. Our numerical results show that, in the uplink
case, the concurrent transmission region subject to 1 dB and 6 dB shadowing standard deviation

(2) two-hop CT-neighbors discovery procedure with a better topology awareness 
capability. With these features, the proposed CT-MAC protocol can enhance the 
overall throughput of a cognitive ad hoc network and avoid the time- and 
energy-consuming wide-band sensing. Other advantages can be summarized as 
follows: 
 overcome the hidden and exposed node issues with physical and virtual carrier 
sensing; 
 backward compatible with the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol; 
 suitable to concurrently transmit various sizes of packets with higher flexibility. 
There are some interesting open issues. So far the proposed concurrent 
transmission MAC protocol has not taken into account of the effect of location 
awareness. In the future, we aim to incorporate the impact of location awareness into 
the concurrent transmission MAC protocol design is also an interesting research 
direction. 
 
Part IV 
 
In this paper, we identified a critical region RCT in which the overlaying cognitive ad 
hoc users and the primary user can concurrently transmit data without causing 
interference to each other. If the location information of other nodes is available, such 
a concurrent transmission region can be easily identified. There are two major 
advantages of identifying the concurrent transmission opportunity. First, the overall 
throughput of the concurrently transmitted data obtained by combining both the 
overlaying cognitive ad hoc networks and the legacy infrastructure-based system is 
much higher than that of the pure infrastructure-based system. Our numerical results 
show that, in the uplink case, the concurrent transmission region subject to 1 dB and 6 
dB shadowing standard deviation can be up to 45% out of the entire cell area with 
about 90% and 60% reliability, respectively. Second, if such a concurrent 
transmission opportunity can be identified first, it is clear that the need of the time- 
and energy-consuming wide-band spectrum scanning process required by most 
existing cognitive radio systems can be reduced dramatically. 
 
In summary, the results presented in this paper provide a design paradigm for 
cognitive radio systems from an alternative perspective -- identifying spectrum 
opportunity cannot just rely on wide-band spectrum sensing techniques. Location 
awareness also provides another important resource to help a cognitive radio system 
identify the opportunities of concurrently using the spectrum of the primary user in

一、參加會議經過 
 
I attended the 1st International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and 
Communications (CROWNCOM 2006) in Mykonos Island, Greece. During the conference, I gave 
present one technical paper. Paper title is “On the Coexistence of Infrastructure-based and Ad Hoc 
Connections for a Cognitive Radio System.” 
 
The CROWNCOM 2006 conference focuses on the hottest topic in wireless communication field –
Cognitive Radio technology. Despite of the short history of the field, cognitive radio is already a 
familiar topic and has attracted an increasing number of projects and researchers to further study 
this emerging technology. Cognitive Radios will revolutionize the way we are using the scarce 
wireless spectrum which is becoming more expensive to acquire. Engineers and scientists have 
recently begun using cooperative and competitive communication methods for cognitive radio to 
improve the quality and reduce the cost of our information transmission. 
 
There were only 31 papers accepted for publish in the conference proceeding. Each submitted paper 
was thoroughly and independently reviewed in accordance with standard blind reviewing practice 
by at least 2 reviewers, with a final average in excess of 3 reviewers per paper. 
 
The technical sessions for this CrownCom cover all areas of interest to the cognitive radio

一、參加會議經過 
 
I attended the IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC 2007) in Las 
Vegas, Nevada USA. During the conference, I gave present one technical paper in the 1st IEEE 
International Workshop on Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN’07). Paper title is “A Cognitive MAC 
Protocol for Overlaying Ad Hoc Networks with QoS Provisioning.” 
 
The CCNC 2007 Conference bears the theme “Seamless Consumer Connectivity,” which reflects 
our focus on the solutions consumers are expecting to be provided to simplify and enhance their 
daily experiences by allowing them to communicate with others and control their environments as
one total and inclusive seamless experience. As our cars, home security systems, mobile phones, 
offices, games, and entertainment systems increase their ability to communicate automatically with 
each other, consumer communications and networking solutions will need to seamlessly fit our 
environment with everything we need or want to feel connected anywhere, anytime. The program 
this year will help everyone to understand some of the issues and technology required to make 
seamless consumer connectivity a reality. 
 
There were over 540 submissions from 44 countries. Over 350 technical experts from all over the 
world participated in the peer review process. Based on the review results, the technical program
committee accepted 181 general conference papers, 46 workshop papers, and 22 demonstrations for 
presentation and publication. Furthermore, 6 tutorials out of 11 proposals were selected that covered

二、與會心得 
 
WCNC 在通訊領域中是一個重要的會議。此次會議所包含的領域非常廣泛，不但有 PHY
的技術，也有 MAC 層的技術。今年，有超過一千七百篇的論文被提交，但是只有八百多篇
的論文被接受，接受率不到五成。 
 
此次會議，藉由上台報告之後的交流，我認識了許多博士生。其中包括了來同樣來自台
灣的南加大留學生以及北京清大及香港科大的學生。藉由彼此交換 MSN，我們期望可以在
將來有更進一步的討論，彼此激盪出更美麗的火花。 
 
這次的香港行，讓我發現香港的雙語教育作的非常成功；小至一般商店的菜單，大至廣
告看板，全部都有中、英文同時標示。這也難怪香港每年會吸引那麼多英語系的觀光客前來
遊玩，這些皆要導因於香港的雙語教育。此外，香港的學生英文聽說能力似乎都很強，這也
是台灣比不上的地方。藉由這次出國的經驗，我更知道台灣的渺小，期望自己能夠再接再厲，
讓全世界都知道台灣。 
 
三、建議 
 
此次香港行是我第一次出國，雖然香港與台灣相距只有短短兩小時飛機時程，不過對我
來說也是個很新鮮的經驗。幸好此次出國有獲得政府的補助，才得以成行。唯一美中不足的
是住宿費沒有補助。現在教育部給每個博士生的錢越來越少，若要藉由參加研討會來提昇自
己的視野與國際觀，其實是相當難成行。希望政府能在合理的範圍內，增加補助項目，讓更
多想出國交流學術的博士生能夠願望成真（例如跟公務人員一樣可以補助生活費）。

報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
 
本次 WCNC 會議於香港舉辦，為期共五日。全部會議包含兩大主題： Networking Technical 
Program Committee 和 Phy/MAC Technical Program Committee。前者於香港半島酒店展開，後
者於香港喜來登酒店報告。本次我的報告是屬於後者的主題。 
 
為了節省出國的開銷，我從網路上找了其它學校的學生一起組團參加 WCNC，並透過燦
星旅行社提供的自由行方案，同時訂飛機票與酒店。因為機票和酒店是綁在一起的，為了節
省開銷，我們只好搭乘非本國籍的國泰航空。不過燦星旅行社的服務效率實在不怎麼樣，這
也是我們貪圖低價所帶來的後果。 
 
第一天，我們是搭下午的飛機到香港。這中間發生了小插曲，原本跟我們同行的成大學
生，因為簽證的問題，被禁止搭飛機。所以為了等他，我們在香港機場等了很久。幸好後來
他成功搭上了下一班飛機來香港，也順利跟我們一起到了飯店。因為我是 WCNC 團的召集
人，所以在這個過程中，我跑東跑西到處問人該怎麼辦，心裡實在是很緊張。對於第一次出
國的我，就碰到這種麻煩事，我當下真的感覺到很倒楣，心想為何要省這些錢，搞的自己亂
七八糟。 
 
第二天，早上我到會場辦理報到後，順便去聽了幾場報告。其中印象最深的是 Cognitive 
Radio 1。我聽到了許多關於 Cognitive Radio 新奇的想法，當然也包括我最有興趣的賽局理論。
 
第三天，這天下午輪到我要上台發表論文。對於第一次出國報告的我，實在是非常緊張，
所以整個早上我都沒有去聽別人的報告，窩在飯店裡面演練我的處女秀。之後，到了我要報
告的房間後，我發現裡面有一個來自南加大的學生，是系上客座教授的學生。他相遇故知，
所以就跟他聊了幾句。接著輪到我上台後，因為之前已經演練過很多次，所以沒什麼大問題。
報告完的 Q&A 時間也有許多人提出他們的問題，我也針對這些問題一一回答。基本上，大
家的評價都很正面。當我報告完後，我留下來繼續聽下一場的報告： Ad Hoc Networks 2。這
場報告很有趣；除了我第一次看到有人有 paper 接受但卻沒來發表，另外一個是，這個場次
除了 chair 和缺席者之外，全部都是華人，每個都聽的懂中文。會後，跟幾個這個場次的博
士班報告者閒聊時，我們還笑稱，這個 session 根本可以用中文報告了！ 
 
第四天，這是最後一天的報告日了。這天比較有收穫的場次應該算是： MAC Protocols 4。
這邊的報告內容，跟我現在正在做的另一個研究有很大的相關性。 
 
第五天，這天是會議的結束日。這天早上有一個很有趣的 tutorial：Routiong in Delay Tolerant 
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks，但是因為要收的錢很貴，所以我沒有報名，真的很可惜。希望下次
政府可以補助多一點錢，這樣我就可以聽到這些大師的精闢演講了。
