gineering systems. This can lead to serious degradation of
the system performance and, if the controller is not de-
signed appropriately, can cause instability of the network
[14-18]. Furthermore, in the TCP/IP networks, the packet
drop probability can be considered as an input and it is
limited to between 0 and 1. Therefore, the effect of a
saturating actuator must be taken into account in the de-
sign phase of the controller. Although several control
schemes have been proposed for linear systems with input
saturation, very few of these schemes are applicable to
congestion control of communication networks, which
are typically large-scale, complex systems.
Inspired by the congestion control developments out-
lined above, this study designs an AQM controller on the
basis of the variable structure control scheme, which
possesses the performance and stability robustness of
non-linear systems [19, 20]. It is shown that the proposed
design has asymptotic stability and is robust to variations
in the RTT.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
the TCP model and presents the control objective. Sec-
tion 3 presents the AQM stabilizing controller design
based on the proposed variable structure control. Section
4 presents the results of the numerical simulations per-
formed to validate the proposed design. Finally, Section 5
provides conclusions.
II. TCP MODEL AND CONTROL OBJECTIVE
This study uses Jacobson’s algorithm to develop a
non-linear fluid-flow dynamic model for TCP networks.
This model relates the average values of the characteristic
network variables, such as the transmission rate per unit
time and the instantaneous queue length. The TCP model
is described by coupled non-linear differential equations
that reflect the dynamics of TCP accurately, which are
described as follows:

where )(tr is the transmission rate per unit time, )(tq is
the instantaneous queue length (in packets), pT denotes
the propagation delay (in seconds), pTCtqt  0)()( is
the transmission round-trip time, 0C is the link capacity
(packets/second), M denotes the number of TCP ses-
sions and 1)(0  tp is the probability of a packet being
marked, which is considered as the control input used to
reduce the sending rate and regulate the bottleneck of the
queue. All of the variables are assumed to be
non-negative and are available. The first equation (1)
describes both the additive increase and multiplicative
decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithm with
traffic rate evolution of the TCP flow. The second equa-
tion (1) represents the dynamics of the queue size ac-
cumulated when the packet transmission rate exceeds the
link capacity. The model is developed with the assump-
tions of homogeneous multiple TCP sessions, a single
bottleneck link, and a delayed feedback configuration. A
more detailed justification of this model is presented in
[11, 22].
The objective of this work is to design a VSC-based
AQM controller to achieve asymptotic stability of the
network described by the non-linear system with a satu-
rated input. The overall VSC-based AQM control system
is depicted in Figure 1.
III. VSC-BASED AQM CONTROLLER DESIGN
Owing to the behavior of the TCP networks, the packet
drop probability of AQM algorithms is limited to be-
tween 0 and 1. In this section, we consider the VSC-AQM
scheme in which both traffic rate and queue length are
assumed to be available.
Let us define the queue length error as dq qtqe  )( ,
where dq is the constant desired queue length. By de-
noting qex 1 , qex 2 , we have:

these are all positive for all times 0t .
To achieve this control objective via VSC-AQM for
the TCP communication networks as shown in Figure 1,
there are two major phases. First, it is necessary to select
an appropriate switching surface for the system, such that
the sliding motion on the manifold is stable. Second, it is
necessary to determine a control law, such that the exis-
tence of the sliding mode can be guaranteed, even under
saturation of the packet drop probability.
Now, the switching surface is defined as:
211),( xxctxs  (4)
where Rts )( and 01 c is the design parameter,
which can easily be determined later. When the system
operates in the sliding mode, it satisfies the following
equations [19,20]:
0)( 211  xxcts  (5)
and:
0)( 211  xxcts (6)
Therefore, the following sliding mode dynamics can be
obtained as:
1121 xcxx  (7.a)
)()()(2 tpthtgx  (7.b)
Obviously, from equations (5) to (7.a), one can see
that if 01 c is specified, then the stability of equation
(7.a) is guaranteed. Furthermore, by equation (6), )(2 tx
is also stable.
Having ensured the stability of the dynamics in the
sliding mode as described above, the next step is to de-
sign a VSC controller to drive the system trajectories onto
the sliding surface.
there were 300 TCP-Reno connections with the senders
shown at the left- and right-hand sides, and 50 connec-
tions for each cross-traffic sender–receiver pair. The
maximum buffer of each router was 200 packets; the
bandwidth and propagation delay of each link are also
indicated in Figure 10. Note that Queues 2 and 4 exhibit
similar trends. Queues 1 and 5 are almost empty, which
indicate that these two links are not bottleneck links. The
responses of the queue lengths for Queues 2 and 3 are
depicted in Figures 11 and 12, respectively.
From these simulations, it can be clearly observed that
the proposed VSC AQM control scheme can be applied
to a more complex network topology and that the per-
formance and robustness of the proposed controller are
superior to those of other AQM schemes.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
The TCP/AQM has been modeled as a non-linear
system with a saturated input due to the limitation im-
posed on the packet drop probability in TCP networks. In
order to achieve an asymptotic stability of the desired
operating point of the TCP network, this study has pro-
posed a VSC-based AQM controller for the non-linear
system. Based on the variable structure control method,
the corresponding AQM congestion control law has been
derived. Numerical simulations performed by both
MATLAB and Network Simulator-2 have been per-
formed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
AQM congestion scheme in various network scenarios.
Both sets of simulation results have confirmed that the
proposed scheme outperforms other schemes.
