ABSTRACT: The precision design of the screw rotor and the gate rotor is the foundation to
promote the operating reliability of a pp-type single screw compressor. The purpose of the present paper is to
determine the mathematical model of a single screw rotor with conical gate rotors. A simple method by gear theory to determine the profiles of
a screw rotor and a gate rotor have been studied. The mathematical model of the screw rotor is defined as the envelope to the family of gate
rotor surfaces. As an example, the pp-type single screw compressor for a compressor ratio of 11:6 is demonstrated with the aid of the proposed
mathematical model. Based on the developed geometrical models, the contour of Von-Mises stress distributions of a
screw rotor and four gate rotors on the proposed mechanism is presented. Using rapid prototyping
(RP) and manufacturing technology, the proposed pp-type single screw compressor with conical
teeth of a gate rotor was designed. The RP primitives provide an actual full-size physical model
that can be analyzed and used for further development. Results from these mathematical models
should have applications in the design of pp-type single screw mechanism.
Keywords: pp-type, single screw compressor
1 Introduction
A single-screw compressor has been developed
that use liquid-refrigerant injection to oil injected
refrigeration and air conditioning compressors. This
kind of the compressor can be installed in large freezers
and air-conditioning systems. To support this
technology, the foundation of the mathematical model
and the manufacture simulation is important. The
mathematical model can be accurately used to predict
the compressor efficiency and cooling performance for
a wide range of compressor capacities and operating
conditions.
A particular advantage of the single screw
compressor is that its performance is much higher than
that of reciprocating compressors [1, 2]. At present,
four types of a single screw compressor are used. They
are cp-type, pc-type, cc-type, and pp-type single screw
compressors. The first letter represents the shape of a
gate rotor in the classification of single screw
compressor. The second letter represents the shape of a
screw rotor in the classification of single screw
compressor. The letter c represents conical surface. The
letter p represents plane shape. The first report of the
cp-type and cc-type single screw compressors were
published by Zimmern in 1960 [3]. Later, Some U.S.
patents of the cp-type single screw compressor [4, 5, 6,
7] were presented. Yang [8, 9] presents an inverse
envelope concept to determine a cutting curve of the cp
type and the cc-type single screw compressor. However,
the mathematical model for the screw-rotor profile of a
pp-type single screw compressor with a conical gate
rotor has not yet been presented in literature.
A pp-type single screw compressor has a single
main screw rotor meshing with four gate rotors with
matching teeth. The screw rotor is driven by a constant
4three regions. Region AB of the gate rotor was used
to generate the helical flutes of the screw rotor. Region
AI of the gate rotor is used to generate the top lands
of the screw rotor. Region BD of the gate rotor is
used to generate the root of the helical flutes of the
screw rotor. Based on the description of this section,
the equation for the gate rotor can be described in terms
of cS coordinate system as:
2-1 Region AB
Region AB shown in Fig. 2 is used to generate
helical flutes of the screw rotor.  and  are the
surface parameters of the gate rotor. In order to
generate the complete profile of the gate rotor, a conical
tooth of the gate rotor will be repeated eleven times
around the center of the gate rotor. According to Figs. 2,
the equation of region AB , represented in coordinate
system cS , can be written as follows:

where h is the tooth length of the proposed gate

one tooth of the gate rotor, as defined in Fig. 2. Here,
parameter gn denotes the number of teeth of the gate

the conical surface of a gate rotor. The conical angle of
the tooth is . Most compressors today have
cylindrical shaped teeth, i.e. =0. A genera
mathematical model of the gate rotor is established in
this paper.

generate the root width of the helical flutes of the screw
rotor.  and  are the surface parameters of the

where  is the surface parameter of gate rotors. Form
parameter of gate rotor is )/(2   gs n .
Parameter )/(   gn is the half angle of one
tooth of gate rotor. The parameter  is the modified
coefficient of the conical surface of a gate rotor. Here,
parameter gn denotes the number of the teeth of a
gate rotor.
In equations (1)-(3), the position vector of the
gate rotor with conical surface is represented as g
cR
and the superscript g indicates regions AB , BD ,
and AI of the gate rotor. The subscript c denotes
that the equations are represented in coordinate system
cS . Following equations (1) to (3) and using a
computer program, one obtains the complete surface of
the conical gate rotor as shown in Fig. 3.
3 Determination of the screw rotor
The coordinate system between a screw rotor and
a gate rotor is illustrated in Fig. 4. The screw rotor and
the gate rotor rotate about their own axes with angular
6To plot the contour of the screw rotor, a computer
program and a computer-aided software is employed to
draw the complete profile of the proposed screw rotor.
Using Eqs. (1)-(9) and Table 1, one can obtain an
envelope to the family of the conical surfaces and
denote as the generated surface  cg ,1R . The
generated surface is the screw rotor, as shown in Fig. 5a.
Moreover, the relationship between the angles c and
1 is given by csg1  )/( nn . To express the
motion of the proposed compressor mechanism, the
assembly of one screw rotor and four gate rotors is
shown in Fig. 5b.
4. Meshing geometry analysis
The contact lines between the screw rotor and
the gate rotor can prevent leakage from the
high-pressure side to the low-pressure side. Besides, if
the contact lines between the two rotors are not
continuous, the gas in the high-pressure side will leak
into the low-pressure side. To reduce this leakage, the
contact lines between the gate rotor and the screw rotor
are discussed in this section.
Equations (4) and (8) represent generated surface
that is screw rotor in three-parametric form in terms of
 c ,, that are related by Eq. (9). Eliminating
 and using csg1  )/( nn , one represents the
generated surface by position vector  cg ,1R
and discusses in section 3. The contact lines on the
screw rotor can be determined as
        0,,,,,, 11  jcjccjc f  gcg RMR , (j=1, 2, 3,…) (10)
where the position vector  ,gcR is the
generating surfaces and discusses in section 2. Matrix
c1M describes the coordinate transformation from
cS to 1S . The generated surface (screw rotor) and the
generating surface (gate rotor) rotate about their own
axes with angular displacement 1 and c ,
respectively. The family of contact lines of the
screw-rotor surface can be obtained by considering
various values of jc (j=1, 2, 3,…). The designed jc
indicates that the generalized parameter of motion c
is fixed-in when the instantaneous contact line is
considered as angle c of the screw rotor’s rotation.
The contact lines on gate-rotor surface are
determined by
    0,,,, jcg f cR , (j=1, 2, 3,…) (11)
When the parameter value j
c
 is given as a
constant, the family of contact lines on the gate-rotor
surface can be obtained. Using Eqs (10) and (11), the
contact lines between gate rotor and screw rotor on
screw rotor are obtained and shown in Fig. 6.
A similar procedure can be applied to determine
the contact lines in a fixed coordinate system. These are
called lines of action. Using the following equation, the
contact lines can be determined by
        0,,,,,,  jccjcfcjcf f  gg RMR (12)
Matrix fcM describes the coordinate
transformation from cS to fS . Parameter
j
c is
the generalized parameter of motion. The lines of action
are shown in Fig. 7.
5. Stress analysis of the proposed pp-type single
screw compressor
The goal of the stress analysis presented in this
section is to evaluate the contact stress for the proposed
pp-type single screw compressor mechanism. The most
powerful method for determining accurate stress and
deflection information is the finite element (FE)
method. This study assumes that there are no assembly
errors. Based on finite method [11] and application of
general proposed computer program [12], the stress
analysis perform is studied. A computer program
running on Windows XP operating system is used to
evaluate the numerical solution for the contact stress
analysis. The material is assumed to be isotropic and
