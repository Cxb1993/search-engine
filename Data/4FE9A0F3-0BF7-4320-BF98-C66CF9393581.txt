In order to apply the evolutionary programming technique, 
encoding technique is necessary.  Each switch combination is 
encoded by a chromosome.  The encode mechanism used in 
this paper is based on the method proposed in [1], [7]. The 
chromosome of the system shown in Figure 1 can be 
represented as following： 
 
Zone Number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
Chromosome 9 1 2 5 10 7 8 11

A previous work using the same encoding method is used to 
compare the performance between traditional GA and asexual 
reproduction [10]. Table I shows the comparisons using 
traditional GA and the asexual reproduction method and the 
results show that the asexual reproduction method performs 
better then traditional GA.

In order to further improve the performance of the asexual 
reproduction method, the concept of EP is adapted. The 
flowchart of the proposed EP for power distribution 
reconfiguration problems is shown in Figure 2.  The detail of 
mutation method used by the EP is shown in Figure 3.  The 
three reproduction steps used by the proposed EP are 
discussed as following： 
 
 
Fig. 2 Proposed EP Method 
1) Selection: 
This procedure selects a part of parent population for 
mutation. “Roulette wheel method” is used for the 
selection.  
 
2) Mutation: 
Traditional GA crossover method may generate illegal 
chromosomes due to the radial structure of distribution 
feeders.  For instance, when the following two legal 
chromosomes [9 1 4 5 10 3 6 11] and [9 1 2 3 10 3 6 11] 
are cross-overed, two new chromosomes are generated, [9 
1 4 3 10 3 6 11] and [9 1 2 5 10 3 6 11].  However, the 
chromosome, [9 1 4 3 10 3 6 11], is illegal.  By 
inspecting this chromosome, it can be found the zones Z3

IV. Numerical Results and Conclusion： 
The numerical results for half population asexual 
reproduction and EP are compared.  A simple test system 
shown in Figure 4 is used to evaluate the performance of the 
two methods.  The test system is a 5-feeder, 25-zone power 
distribution system. The load current of each zone is marked 
next to zone id. The capacity of each feeder is also marked 
next to the feeder id. The objective function is to minimize 
system loss and feeder load balancing. Note that, the target 
fitness value is 0.914.  This value is pre-calculated and is 
used to terminate the evolution iterations.  A population size 
of 50 is used for each method.  In order to calculate the 
average performance, 10 runs are performed for each method.

  The results show that all methods can reach the optimal 
solution within 1000 generation.  The chromosome of the 
best solution is [16 1 4 5 17 3 9 18 10 19 20 11 12 15 2], the 
configuration representation by this chromosome is shown in 
Figure 5.  The system loss is 1.1560 and the feeder load 
balancing is 0.0382 in this configuration.  The loading of 
each feeder is shown in Table Ⅲ.  The performance of EP 
shown in Table Ⅳ indicates that it takes less generation to 
reach the optimal solution.

In the conclusion, the characteristics of radial distribution 
system are used for the proposed EP.  The multiple objective 
functions are combined by applying normalization method in 
this paper. By utilizing EP with normalization method, optimal 
solution can be found faster than traditional GAs.
