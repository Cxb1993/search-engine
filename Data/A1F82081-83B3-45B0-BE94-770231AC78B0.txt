calculated from Langmuir adsorption isotherm were 8.50 and 11.91 mg/g 
chitosan-coated sand for Cu2+ and Pb2+, respectively. The kinetic data were tested and 
followed pseudo-second order reaction which indicated that the chemical sorption was 
the rate-limiting step. Desorption studies indicate the potential for recovering Cu(II) and 
Pb(II) from chitosan-coated sand. Therefore, these preliminary results indicate the 
possibility using of chitosan-coated sand to establish an in-situ permeable reactive 
barrier as filters for metal removal from flowing contaminated groundwater plumes.

1. Introduction 
 
To remediate heavy metals from groundwater and industrial wastewater is one of 
the most important issues in the environment. The presences of metals such as copper, 
lead, cadmium, nickel, arsenic and chromium can be risk to human health and 
ecological system. The main sources of these heavy metals are mining industries, 
metal-plating industries, illegal landfills, and abandoned waste disposal. 
 
Copper and lead, as example, are natural elements that mostly used in the industry 
and potential pollution impact. Copper is a very common substance that occurs naturally 
in the environment and spreads through the environment by natural phenomena. 
However, when copper is extensively used and increasing the level in the environmental, 
it can be toxic to human beings. Lead is a cumulative poison and environmental 
exposure can particularly affect the central nervous system. Lead can contaminate the 
environment from anthropogenic sources as well as natural geochemical processes, 
which is widely used in industrial application such as storage battery, manufacturing 
printing pigments, fuels and steel industries (Sakaguchi et al., 1981). 
 
Currently, the most widely used remediation technologies are based on 
physical-chemical processes, including filtration, chemical precipitation, ion exchange, 
adsorption, electro-deposition, and membrane systems for water treatment, and 
excavation followed by burial at a hazardous waste site for soil treatment. All these 
methods have limitations and disadvantages to remove heavy metals in water. In the 
past years, adsorption is one of the effective and economical methods for removing 
metal ions from water. Many low cost adsorbents have been investigated and widely 
used for adsorption on heavy metal ions. 
 
Biopolymers are biodegradable material, non-toxic, efficient, inexpensive and 
highly competitive with ion-exchange resins and activated carbon. Another attractive 
feature of biopolymer is that they posses a number of different functional groups, such 
as hydroxyls and amines, which increase the efficiency to bind metal ions (Juang et al., 
1997; Annadurai et al., 2008). Chitosan is a natural biopolymer that derived from the 
deacetylation of chitin, which extracted from crustaceans shells. Chitin is the second 
most abundant organic compound in nature next to cellulose. Furthermore, chitosan has 
many characteristics such as biocomapatibility, biodegradability and anti-bacterial 
properties. 
 
Chitosan chelates five to six times greater amounts of metal than chitin. This is

Elmer 2000DV), was used for quantitative determination of the concentration of metal 
ions. Moreover, standard solutions for calibration curve of ICP-OES were prepared as 
followed: 10 mL of 1000mg/L of ICP standard was diluted to 100 mL of de-ionized 
water (stock standard solution). From the stock solution, pipetted 0.5, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 
10 mL into 100 mL volumetric flask and diluted to 100 mL mark.  
 
3. Methodology 
 
3.1 Batch adsorption studies 
 
The batch adsorption studies were carried out at room temperature. The 30 mL of 
metal ion solution were placed in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask and added with 2.5 grams of 
chitosan-coated sand. The metal ion concentration varied from 100 – 2000 mg/L. The 
equilibration (shaking) time was 24 hours at a static speed of 50rpm. After the 
equilibrium, the solution was filtered using Whatman #40 filter paper and the 
supernatant solution was analyzed with ICP-OES. The amount of metal ion adsorbed 
per unit mass of adsorbent was calculated using the equation: 
 
m
vCeCoQo
)( −=
 
 
where: Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration of metal ion 
solution (mg/L), respectively: v is the volume of the solution in liter (L); and m is the 
amount of chitosan-coated sand in grams (g).  
The percentage adsorption was calculated using the equation: 
 
100)(% x
Co
CeCoAdsorption −=
 
where: Co and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration of metal ion 
solution (mg/L). 
 
3.2 Batch pH studies 
 
The effect of metal ion adsorption was studied in pH range 2-6. The initial metal 
ion concentration of 100 mg/L was adjusted to the required pH value using 1N 
hydrochloric acid and 1N sodium hydroxide. The 2.5 grams of chitosan-coated sand 
were equilibrated at the particular pH of 30 mL metal ion solution for 24 hours at a 
static of 50 rpm. After the equilibrium, the solution was filtered and the supernatant 
solution was analyzed in ICP-OES. The final pH was recorded after filtration of the 
solution.  
 
3.3 Kinetics of adsorption 
 
In order to investigate the controlling mechanism of the adsorption processes, 
pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetics were applied in the data. 
 
3.3.1 Pseudo-first order kinetics 
The pseudo first-order kinetics can expressed as: 
 6
b
kQ L=max
 
 
where: kL and b can be determined from the linear plot of 1/Qo against 1/Ce. 
3.4.2 Freundlich Isotherm Model 
The other widely used empirical equation, the Freundlich equation, was based 
on adsorption on a heterogeneous surface. The equation was commonly represented by: 
 
nCkQ efo =  
 
where: kf is roughly an indicator of the adsorption capacity and 1/n of the 
adsorption intensity. A linear form of the Freundlich equation will yield the constant kf 
and 1/n. 
efo Cn
kQ 1lnln +=  
 
Therefore, kf and 1/n can be determined from the linear plot of ln Qo versus ln Ce. The 
magnitude of the exponent 1/n gives an indication of the favourability of adsorption. 
Values of n>1 obtained represent favourable adsorption conditions (Boddu et al., 2003). 
 
3.5 Desorption Studies 
 
Desorption studies were performed using tap water (pH=7) and diluted 
hydrochloric acid solutions (pH 1 and 3),. These experiments were carried out by 
immersing the metal ions-loaded chitosan-coated sand in 30 mL of tap water and diluted 
acid solutions for 4 hours at a static speed of 50 rpm. Then, filtered and the supernatant 
solution was analyzed in ICP-OES. The percentage of desorptiom was calculated from 
the following expression: 
100% x
m
mDesorption
a
d=  
 
where: md  is the amount of metal ion desorbed (mg/L) and ma is the amount of 
metal ion adsorbed (mg/L). 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
 
4.1 Batch adsorption experiment  
 
The effect of initial concentration and contact time is one of the main factors in 
adsorption of metal ion in aqueous solution, because it determines the capacity of 
adsorbent to remove specific metal ions in the solution at the equilibrium time. Figure 1 
shows the increase in adsorption capacity varied with the initial concentration of Cu2+ 
and Pb2+ ions in 0.5–24 hours contact time. An increase in the initial concentration led to 
an increase in the adsorption capacity. After binding capacity of the adsorbent 
approaches saturation, thus the maximum adsorption capacity was achieved. Therefore, 
the results of adsorption kinetic of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions illustrated that the effectiveness 
of chitosan-coated sand could remove the metals ions in aqueous solution. The

4.3 Kinetics of adsorption 
 
In order to investigate the controlling mechanism of the adsorption processes, 
pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order kinetic analyses were undertaken. Table 1 
illustrates the kinetics of adsorption of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions onto chitosan-coated sand, 
where the data employed in pseudo-second order very well.

In many cases, the pseudo-first order dot not fit well to the whole range of contact 
time is generally applicable over the initial stage of adsorption process (Ho and Mckay, 
1998). The pseudo-first order kinetic process has been used for reversible reaction with 
an equilibrium being established between liquid and solid phases. Whereas, the pseudo 
second-order kinetic model assumes that the limiting rate step may be chemical 
adsorption. Several studies for adsorption of divalent metals on heterogeneous sorbents 
reposted that most of the metal sorption kinetics follow pseudo-second order 
mechanism. (Ho, 2006). It is more likely to predict that the adsorption behavior may be 
involve valency forces through sharing of electrons between transition metal cations and 
adsorbent (Sakaguchi et al., 1981). 
 
4.4 Adsorption Isotherm 
 
Adsorption isotherm models describe the relationship between adsorbates and 
adsorbents at equilibrium. The two most well-known isotherm models are the Langmuir 
and the Freundlich. The experimental adsorption data were fitted according to Langmuir 
and Freundlich isotherm equations. The isotherm model that gave the best fit to the 
equilibrium data was applicable to the adsorption process. 
 
Langmuir isotherm model is most suitable model of monolayer adsorption. The 
model is based on the assumptions that there are a finite numbers of adsorption sites. All 
sites are equivalent and there is no interaction between adsorbed ions. Table 2 illustrates 
that the results for both Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions were found to be linear and had a greater 
than 0.9800 correlation coefficients. Moreover, in Langmuir isotherm, the maximum 
adsorption capacity, Qmax represent the monolayer saturation at equilibrium. Table 2 
illustrates the maximum adsorption capacities for Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions, which were 
obtained 8.50 mg Cu/g chitosan-coated sand and 11.91 mg Pb/g chitosan-coated sand at 
 10
adsorbed Cu(II) and Pb(II) with subsequent reuse of adsorbents. However, the results of 
tap water illustrates that the percentage recovery was obtained only 5% or less for Cu(II) 
and not more than 33% for Pb(II). This is an indication of the stability of bound Cu, 
which is not easily removed in practice.

Table 5 indicates that increased in contact time is not significant in desorption of 
Cu(II) and Pb(II) on the acid solution. Based on the result, the percentage recovery of 
Pb(II) illustrates the highest recovery as compared to Cu(II). Moreover, changes in Cu 
concentrations illustrate no effect on Cu desorption from chitosan-coated sand, as 
compared to Pb adsorbability, which is strongly influenced by the concentration of Pb in 
solution.
