Abstract 
 
In Taiwan, we have already succeeded in 
developing and utilizing the carbon nanotube (CNT) 
to manage the carbon nanotube-field emission display 
(CNT-FED). Under the globalization of fierce market 
competition, and changeable demand of products from 
customers, when enterprises are developing new 
products, to make the most appropriate response to the 
fast change of the market, if there is an effective way 
to find out and analyze the key element weight of 
engineering design, and key factor of production, it 
will have heavy benefit at developing new products 
for research and develop groups. On the whole 
evolution, through literature review and expert's 
interview, we combine Bayesian Networks, Quality 
Function Deployment and Quality Engineering to 
construct a suitable quantity analyze pattern for 
CNT-FED when developing a new product. By this 
approach, we can use the least number of experiments 
to determinate the best combination of parameter level, 
and substantially reduce the cost by try and error, and 
also reduce the time from developing to diffusion. 
 
Keywords: CNT-FED, Quality Control, Quality 
Indices, Quality Function Deployment, Research and

The Taguchi Method (Taguchi, 1987) mainly differs from traditional design of experiments in effectively reducing the product 
functionality variance when a product is delivered from manufacturer to customer (Phadke, 1989). With the introduction of loss 
function, the method helps engineer to minimize the quality cost not only in on-line production quality control but off-line quality 
control as well. Moreover, the method emphasizes on quality design at the research and development process and provides technician 
with prior and preventive quality control.  
Most applications of Taguchi methods only deal with the optimization of a single-response process. However, we often have to 
deal with multi-response process or product, and these responses maybe have highly correlation. Hence, more and more scholars in 
recent year have conducted the studies relating to the multi-response product and the optimization of manufacturing process. 
Logothetis and Haigh (1988) followed the basic assumption of statistics test and proposed several solutions for designing an optimal 
multi-response process. They used a weight to simplify multiple dimensions into one dimension; however, the correlation between 
quality characteristics has not been considered during the design process. Phadke (1989) applied the Taguchi method in IC process for 
optimizing chemical vapor deposition, which involving multi-response process of polysilicon. 
Shiau (1990) suggested applying a proper weight for each quality SN rat io and adding up the weighted ratio to find the 
optimization of parameter design in iron ore sintering process. Although the calculation process is easy to follow, it is always difficult 
to determine the appropriate weight for each SN ratio. In additions, using the summation of weighted SN ratio as the performance 
measuring indices needs to be further testified for its applicability. Yang (1996) proposed an effective procedure to optimize the 
multi-response process on the basis of the principal components. With the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a set of the original 
responses can be transformed into a set of uncorrelated components (Tong and Su, 1997; Antony, 2000). The optimal settings of the 
design parameters for multi-response problems can then be obtained easily by Taguchi's idea. However, PCA does not work well 
under the cases of only few quality characteristics involved or no significant relationship between selected quality characteristics. 
Yeh (1997) adopted regression analysis and desirability functions to solve the optimization problem of multi-response in a 
dynamic system. The author first used the regression analysis to identify the control factors which will affect quality variance. Then, 
based on the Smaller-The-Better (STB) quality characteristics in system variance and the degree of sensitivity in the 
Larger-The-Better (LTB), the Normal-The-Best (NTB), and the STB characteristics, the author integrated the variance and sensitivity 
into an expected total quality value. As a consequence, the expected total quality value can be used to design the optimal parameters. 
Chen (1998) used desirability functions integrating with dual response surface analysis to find the optimal parameter design for 
multi-response production process. Since each experimental group need to build up its own pertinent regression model and the number 
of experiments for each experimental group is limited, the repeatability and reproducibility of regression model needs to be further 
verified. Tarng et al. (2000) applied fuzzy logic and Taguchi method to solving the optimization of multi-response production process 
problem by transforming multi-response into single-response indices. In fact, using fuzzy inference system to decide the membership 
function of SN ratio for each quality characteristics should be further testified for the accuracy. Hung (2002) integrated grey relational 
analysis and Taguchi method to identify the optimal parameter design. This approach solves the complex correlation problem of 
multi-response quality characteristics and the coefficient of grey relation may benefit engineer in comprehending the relationship 
between process parameter and quality characteristics (Jeyapaul, 2005). 
To this end, the reviewed studies show that most proposed methodologies for optimizing multi-response process have the 
problems of uncertainty and complexity. However, we found using the combination of Taguchi method, grey relational analysis, and 
fuzzy inference system as an integrated approach can improve the optimization of parameter design by: 
(1) Using Taguchi method to design the optimal parameter. The Taguchi method can be used to minimize the number of 
experiments and find the optimal parameter design. Using traditional design of experiments for searching optimal parameter 
of production process will be time consuming and costly.  
(2) Using grey relational analysis to identify the correlation among responses. The multi-response quality characteristics in 
production process are related to each other. However, how to identify the correlation among response has become an issue 
for engineer. Since the grey relational coefficient can be used to help engineer comprehend the relationship between process 
parameters and quality characteristics, using a combination approach by joining Taguchi method and grey relational analysis 
can effectively identify the correlation among quality characteristics and provide a reliable support to design parameter. 
(3) Using fuzzy inference system to integrate multi-response quality characteristics. When deciding an optimal parameter design 
in Taguchi method, engineer mostly depends on expert’s subjective assertion. In order to obtain an objective parameter 
design, we use fuzzy inference system to transform multi-response quality characteristics into single performance index. 
 
 
M ETHODOLOGY AND MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
 
In this study, we integrated Taguchi method, grey relational analysis and fuzzy inference system to optimize parameter design in 
multi-response production process. The methodology is developed as following three stages and six steps. 
Stage 1. Computing each response’s normalized SN ratio. 
Step 1. Computing the SN ratio for each quality characteristics. 
According to the single-response analysis of Taguchi method, product quality characteristics can be classified as LTB, STB, and 
NTB. The SN ratio of each quality characteristics is computed by following: 
The largest MPCI will be selected as the optimal parameter among the orthogonal arrays. Besides, the average of MPCI needs to 
be calculated for drawing the response chart and finding the overall optimal parameter-level set. 
Step 6. Validating the optimal parameter choice. 
 
The optimal parameter-level set identified in step 5 will be compared with the existing optimal one for deciding which one is 
better. If the new optimal set is worse than existing one, the design of experiment will be reviewed and modified until the optimal 
parameter design is attained. 
 
 
CASE STUDY OF CNT-BLU 
 
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we selected Thick-Film Screen Printing Process (TFSPP) of Carbon 
Nanotube Back Light Unit (CNT-BLU) under the laboratory development as study case to illustrate how to find the optimization of 
parameter design. All layers of cathode and anode plate of CNT-BLU use screen printing to finish the coating. The processes include 
the Screen Printing Ag, Exposure & Developing, Screen and Printing CNT Paste. Since the Screen and Printing CNT Paste is under 
the research and development stage, most of the parameter designs depend on engineer’s experience. An inaccurate parameter design 
often results in the failure of product development, increasing cost, and delaying the production schedule.  
In this study, the authors select the factors (snap off, squeegee pressure, printing speed, and coater pressure) as controllable parameter 
and quality characteristics (positioning accuracy and screen printing thickness) as experimental output variables (STB). The 
controllable parameter factors and related level factors are listed in Table 1.

Factors 1 2 3 
A (snap off) mm 5.3 4.1* 3.2 
B (squeegee pressure) kg/cm2 60.0*  40.0 20.0

D (coater pressure) kg/cm2 20.0 15.0 10.0* 
Table 1: The controllable parameters and level factors ( * the current level) 
The four parameter factors are then allocated into the orthogonal arrays of 9L for commencing the experiments. Let assume two 
experimental output variables have the same weighting. Each experiment will results in 16 different screen printing areas. After 
measuring the quality characteristics of each area, the average will be the confirmed experimental observation. 
Stage 1. Computing each response’s normalized SN ratio. 
Step 1. Computing the SN ratio by using formula (2) for each quality characteristics (as shown in Table 2)
