防治預拌土壤材料乾縮裂縫之研究 
 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
 
The cementation of mudstone and gypsum in the natural Yadan topology is modeled for the prevention of 
development of dry shrinkage cracks in ready-mixed soil material (RMSM); addition of gypsum to clayey soils 
to act as a coating that modifies the base soil is proposed. Cement is mixed with this modified clayey soil to 
form RMSM, which is resistant to the development of drying shrinkage cracks. Results of the study showed 
changes in the water content between liquid limit and shrinkage limit is very small for this modified clayey soil. 
Respectively, its volumetric change from liquid to solid state is also substantially small, hence shrinkage cracks 
are less likely to develop. Tests for dry shrinkage were conducted on the RMSM to a period of 1 year, and no 
development of crack has been observed.

摘 要 
 
 
本研究乃利用雅丹地形中泥岩與石膏膠結之機制，研擬防治預拌土壤材料乾縮裂縫之方法。首先，將水
泥拌入黏質土壤中，以形成預拌土壤材料（RMSM）。然後，再拌以不同比例之石膏材料，並置於室外
環境下，探討其乾縮裂縫之阻抗能力。由試驗結果發現，在加入石膏後，預拌土壤材料之液性限度與縮
性限度之差距變小，亦即土壤材料由液態到固態時，其體積變化甚小，因此其發展乾縮裂縫之機會相形
變小。室外試驗達一年後，仍無裂縫產生。

INTRODUCTION 
 
Ready-mixed soil material (RMSM) is a new range of soil material with properties lying between controlled 
low-strength material (CLSM) and soil cement. The design approach of RMSM combined the advantages of 
both CLSM and soil cement, yet overcomes the problem of CLSM not able to satisfy ease of re-excavation and 
soil cement’s inability to construct rapidly. The unconfined compressive strength of RMSM is 2 to 30 times of 
soil materials, and the flexural strength is about 5 to 10 percent of its unconfined compressive strength. The 
RMSM material discussed in this study has advantages such as safety, friendly to the environmental, low cost, 
speed of construction and the ability to re-excavate at a later date [1]. But where the base constituent soil of 
RMSM is clay, like any normal clayey soils, with exposure to the sun, RMSM will likely develop large dry 
shrinkage cracks. This is due to temperature differences in the soil caused by the water content in the soil itself. 
With prolonged length of exposure to the sun, many RMSM materials will loose its cohesiveness and break 
apart. This has limited the use of RMSM, at the moment, to underground engineering works and its use in 
surface structures is not feasible (Fig. 1).

150g of water is added to each sample and mixed well before allowing to dry in a sheltered environment of 50 ~ 
60% RH moisture and temperature 20 ~ 30oC. Development of cracks on the samples is observed. 
 
Changes in the Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit and Shrinkage Limit of the Modified Clayey Soil 
 
Select one clayey soil and prepare a modified soil sample using 90% of the selected clayey soil with 10% CaSO4. 
Perform liquid limit and plastic limit tests according to ASTM D4318-00 [6] and shrinkage limit test according 
to ASTM D427-04 [7]. Then compare the changes in the volume and water content of the 2 soils. 
 
Ready-Mixed Soil Material Mixtures 
 
A total of 4 RMSM mixtures were established for this research (Table 3). The cement content for each cubic 
meter of RMSM mixes R-1 to R-3 is 100 kg/m3, 200 kg/m3 and 300 kg/m3 respectively. The cement content for 
mix R-4 is also 100 kg/m3, but 10% of the soil is replaced with gypsum to form the modified soil. 
 
Casting and Curing of Test Specimens 
 
For each mix design (mix R-1 to R-4), a total of 20 test cylinders (75×150mm) and 10 flexural beam specimens 
(76.2×76.2×285.8mm) were prepared; a total of 80 test cylinders and 40 beams were cast for this study. After 
casting, test specimens were covered with plastic sheets and left in the casting room for 24 hours at a 
temperature of about 23oC. 10 test cylinders and 10 beams of each mix is placed into a 100% RH moist curing 
room at 23±2oC until the time of test after demolding. Another 10 test cylinders of each mix is placed in an 
indoor environment of 50 ~ 60% RH and temperature 20 ~ 30oC to dry out naturally to ages 1 month, 3 months 
and 1 year. Dry shrinkage cracks or lose of cohesion of the specimens were observed. 
 
Unconfined Compressive Strength Tests 
 
Test cylinders were removed from the moist curing room at various ages of testing (1, 7, 28 and 90 day). The 75 
× 150mm test cylinders were tested in accordance with ASTM D4832-02 [8] at each test age to determine the 
compressive strengths. For the 1 and 7 day compressive strength tests, 2 cylinders were tested and the average 
of the compressive strengths were taken as the test result, for the 28 and 90 day compressive strength, the 
average of 3 test results were taken as the compressive strength result. 
 
Flexural Strength Tests 
 
76.2 × 76.2 × 285.8mm beams were prepared in accordance with ASTM D1632-96 [9] for each test age to 
determine the flexural strengths. The beams were tested for flexural strength at 1, 7, 28 and 90 days. For the 1 
and 7 day bending test, the average of 2 test results were taken as the flexural strength, for the 28 and 90 day 
bending test, the average of 3 test results were taken as the flexural strength. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Determination of the Boundary Clay Content that the Development of Dry Shrinkage Cracks Occur 
 
Fig. 3 exhibits the crack patterns for soils with different clay content mixed well with water and dried naturally. 
Fig. 3(a) is the condition for sandy soil without clay; it can be observed that no crack has developed after drying 
naturally. When the clay content in the soil is increased to 20%, from Fig. 3(b) it can be observed that some fine 
cracks has developed after drying naturally. When the clay content is further increased to 40%, from Fig. 3(c) it 
can be seen that a large pattern of fine cracks has developed after drying naturally. When the clay content of the 
soil continues to be increased to 60%, from Fig. 3(d)~3(f), large fissured cracks after natural drying can be

The development of Yadan involves 2 key factors. One is the geology of the terrain that develops such topology, 
i.e. sedimentary lake basin stratum. The second factor is the external forces of erosion, namely a uni-directional 
strong desert wind erosion and erosion by the flow of water. In the dry lake basin area, repeated flow in and 
flow out of water in the history of the lake form has resulted the stratified layers of mudstone and sand. Wind 
and water flow would carry away the loose sand layers, but has limited effect on the hard cemented layers of 
mudstone and gypsum. Temperature changes in the desert area is extreme, such thermal expansion and 
contraction of mudstone finally causes fracture in mudstone, allowing the exposed sand layer to be again carried 
away by wind and water, with time, forming the deep grooves in the topology. The part of the topology still 
covered by the hard cemented layer of mudstone and gypsum are very stable, forming mounds of earth 10m to 
30m tall in the Yadan topology (Fig. 8); their existence has been over thousands of years [10]. 
 
This study modeled the cementing conditions of mudstone and gypsum by mixing gypsum to clayey soil and 
adding cement to bind the modified soil together, as presented in Fig. 2. The gypsum acting like a coating 
material for the clayey soil forms a hard shell over soil particles, thereby modifying the soil. Since the model 
presented can resolve problems of development of dry shrinkage cracks and lose of cohesion in RMSM, RMSM 
can be applied to surface structures. At the same time the model has been verified by the nature, it is believe that 
this model would expand the scope of application of RMSM. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
1. At a clay content of 20%, soil will exhibit some fine cracks after drying naturally. When the clay content is 
increased to 40%, a large pattern of fine cracks will develop. When the clay content is over 60%, large 
fissured cracks will occur. 
 
2. In this study, gypsum is used as a coating material to clayey soil to form a modified clayey soil. The changes 
in water content between the liquid limit and shrinkage limit is minimal, hence the volumetric change from 
liquid state to solid state is minimized. Naturally, modified soil is less likely to develop dry shrinkage 
cracks. 
 
3. Although ordinary RMSM produced from clayey soil uses cement up to 300 kg/m3, but its durability is less 
than 1 year. Respectively, modified clayey soil uses only 100 kg/m3 of cement, but no crack was observed 
after 1 year. This verifies that the    modified RMSM model proposed in this paper is correct. 
 
4. This study modeled the cementing layers of mudstone and gypsum in a natural Yadan topology. In this 
model, gypsum is added to clayey soil as a coating material, and modified clayey soil is cemented together 
using cement to prevent cracks developing from the drying shrinkage of RMSM. 
 
5. The RMSM proposed in this study can overcome damages that occur from the dry shrinkage of clayey 
materials. It is believed that RMSM will largely replace traditional soil backfill materials and extensively 
change the scope of application of earth materials.
