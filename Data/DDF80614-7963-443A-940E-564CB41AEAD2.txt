2Abstract
In this work, Electromigration in Cu dual damascene interconnects has been investigated in terms of metal line width and
thickness. The failure lifetime was found to decrease with decreasing line thickness and width. Furthermore, electromigration
lifetime was greatly decreased as the line width was decreased to 0.07m width. In addition to interface diffusion, the
microstructure of Cu can be the dominant path for electromigraton mass transport. As a result, as the generation is scaled down
to below 45 nm technology, electromigration behaviour will limit allowable current in the integrated circuit. In this study, the
process improvement actions including the new copper surface passivation and bamboo-like Cu microstructure are presented
and demonstrated an improvement electromigration performance.
Additionally, we analyzed the effect of the size and location of electromigration-induced void on the metal lead resistance
increase for Cu interconnections with various line widths by simulation method. It is shown that the void location and growth
direction has a significant impact on resistance increase. Void underneath the via in formation and growth stages has a negative
impact on resistance increase. For a narrower line, the critical void size to cause 10% resistance shift is apparently reduced.
Therefore, the control of void size and growth direction becomes imperative for electromigration improvement as the
interconnect continuously scales down.
Finally, the influence of moisture on Cu line electromigration (EM) behavior of dual damascene interconnection is
reported. We have found that moisture has a negative influence on EM behavior, but it depends on the seal-ring structure
located along the peripheral of the test pattern. The reduced Cu lifetime, observed for tested samples without seal-ring structure,
was due to lateral moisture penetration. Lateral moisture diffusion was considered an effective mechanism for deteriorating the
Cu interface during the die-sawing processing for structures without seal-ring layout. As a result, the seal-ring layout is
effective and essential in Cu/low-dielectric (low-k) material integrity to prevent moisture penetration during the package
procedures.

(A)Scaling Effect on Electromigration Characteristics
EM tests were performed on Cu interconnects stressed with electrons flow from a via above to a line below, as shown in Fig.
1. The Cu interconnects are 250 m long with metal width ranging from 0.07 to 0.2 m. The via size is the same as the
linewidth. For line thickness experiment, the line thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.14 m and 0.10 m, respectively, while all the
width kept at 1m. The stress current density was 2 MA/cm2 at a fixed temperature of 325oC. A sample size of 20-30 was used
for each experiment. Resistance increase with time was monitored until failure. Failure criterion of 10 % resistance increase
was employed. The current supply was stopped at 30 % increase in order to minimize the electromigration damage to the Cu
interconnects for physical failure analysis.

(B) Moisture Effect on Electromigration Characteristics
The EM test structures with 250-m-long metal fabricated using a Cu double-layered dual damascene interconnect were
evaluated in this study. The Cu interconnects were embedded in low-k material (organo silicate glass; SiOC) and processed
with a SiCN capping layer. In this study, dense (k=2.8) or porous (k=2.5) low-k materials deposited by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition were used. For the porous (k=2.5) low-k materials, UV curing was performed for porogen removal.
The average pore size and porosity of the porous low-k materials are ~2.5 nm in diameter and ~10 %, respectively. The
scrubber clean with water jet and soft brush clean was used to evaluate the effect of moisture on the Cu interconnect
performance. Both metal width and via dimension in the EM test structures are 0.1m. The stressing electron is flowing from
lower metal line to higher metal line through the via, as shown in Fig. 2. Two types of EM test patterns were prepared on the
same wafer: one had a seal-ring layout and the other had no seal-ring layout. The metal dimension of the seal-ring is 0.5 m.
Both tests were conducted after wafer die-sawing, die mounting on the ceramic package and bonding wire. The stress
temperature varied from 275oC to 350oC at a fixed current density of 1.5 MA/cm2. A sample size of 20 to 30 samples was used
for each experiment. Resistance increase with time was monitored until failure. A failure criterion of 10% resistance increase
was employed. The current supply was stopped at 30 % increase to minimize the EM damage to the Cu interconnects for
physical failure analysis.

6Fig. 6 shows a plot of median lifetime (t50) as a function of metal line widths. Similar to the line thickness effect on
electomigration, the median lifetime is clearly decreased with decreasing line width. Moreover, for line width >0.1m line
width, the median lifetime (t50) is linearly inversely proportional to the line width. However, as the line width is further
deceased to nanometer (or migrates to below 45 nm technology), the electromigration lifetime is significantly decreased,
largely diverging from the linear trend. This implies that as the line width is shrunk to below 0.07 m, electromigration
performance will be further deteriorating and will be a potential issue.
By means of SEM and resistance versus time plot analyses, both indicate that the failure mode was not altered for 0.07
m-width metal lines; voiding was found in Cu line without extra failure modes (no via-related failure mode).
Since electromigration induced voiding is on the Cu/capping dielectric interface, the void growing velocity or Cu drift
velocity can be expressed through the change rate of metal line resistance given by [5]

The normalized Cu drift velocity based on resistance versus time plot can be calculated as shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, it is
clearly shown that the Cu drift velocity in 0.07 m-width Cu line is extraordinary high. This suggests that there is a new
electromigration acceleration factor in addition to higher surface diffusion due to the thickness reduction as the line width is
less than 0.1m. Based on the result of TEM and coefficient of resistance (TCR) of Cu lines, gain size of Cu line is
proportional to the TCR values. The Cu lines with lower TCR values have higher percentile fine grain structure. Furthermore,
gain size and TCR values of Cu lines decreased with the reduction the line width. The degradation trend is similar to that of the
median lifetime. As a result, the additional electromigration path is suspected to be the contribution of Cu microstructure.

III. Solutions for Electromigration Scaling Effect
As interconnect dimension continues scaling, two electromigration diffusion mechanisms (surface and microstructure
diffusion) would result to a worse electromigration behavior. Therefore, in order to alleviate surface mass transportation, new
Cu interface passivation was provided to replace conventional SiCN capping in Cu technology. Fig. 8 shows the
electromigration median lifetime for different Cu interface layers as a function of the line area. The benefit was similar with
other reports [5, 6], CoW, CuSix and TiN capping processes were demonstrated to be effective in suppressing electromigratiom
in our study. On the other hand, to improve Cu microstructure, we utilize the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) as the
Cu microstructure index. Large TCR values represent larger grain size in Cu lines. Fig. 9 displays the TCR values for different
line widths and thicknesses. The value of TCR is significantly decreased to 0.22C-1 for line width of 0.07 m. By optimizing
ECP process, both TCR value and failure time are enlarged as shown in Fig. 10.
8II. Effect of void location and direction on resistance
The effect of void location in the lower metal line on the resistance increase of via-line structure is shown in Fig. 13. The
metal width is 0.07 m. It can be seen that the void location site-B is the most sensitive on resistance increase for void
formation and growth. For initial void length of less than 0.02 m, there is no a significant impact on the resistance. However,
as void length is larger than 0.03m, the resistance significantly increases with the velocity of resistance increase as high as 3.0
times/m shift. Furthermore, as void extends and occupies the whole via, the resistance jumps to infinite and cause the short
interconnect because the current was impeded by void underneath the via. In case of other three void location cases, the
resistance increase is less than 10 %for void length of less than 0.1m. The inset in Fig. 13 shows resistance shift of Void
site-A, C, and D as a function of void length. As expected, as void location is site-A, a reservoir location, the void growth has
no impact on resistance because no current flow this region at any conditions, suggesting a reservoir is a good resource to
enlarge EM lifetime. For void site-C and D with depletion along Cu/ESL interface, a comparable performance was observed,
but the resistance shift of site-C is slightly larger than that of site-C. The reason is not clear, but it is presumably related to a
higher current density, which was observed as void is located at site-C. Furthermore, to reach 10% resistance shift, the void
length should be larger than ~0.4m (3.6% total length). For void location site-C, there are three void directions along the
different interfaces (Cu/TaN, Cu/ESL, and Bulk Cu) as shown in the inset in Fig. 12. The growth direction depends on interface
bonding strength [6]. As shown in Fig. 14, the resistance increase for void growth along Cu/TaN (II) is significantly higher than
that for void growth along ESL interface, indicating void underneath the via is the fatal void. For case III with downward
depletion, the resistance shift is higher than 10% as the depletion depth is above 0.06m. Based on the above results obtained
from simulation, void underneath the via is the fatal contributor on resistance increase, inducing EM failure. The adhesion
strength of Cu/TaN is higher than that of Cu/ESL, the void preferably grow up along the Cu/ESL interface, which is positive on
resistance increase and EM lifetime. However, process-induced-defect on via bottom deteriorate Cu/TaN interface, leading to
void formation and grow up underneath the via. Therefore, it is essential to pay more attention on via-bottom engineering to
avoid void formation and growth in this location, thus ensuring the better EM performance.

II. Effect of metal width on critical void size
The resistance shift for line-via structure with different line-widths as a function of void size is displayed in Fig. 15.
The void location is on the site-D. As seen in Fig. 15, a higher increase velocity in resistance was observed as void size
increases. Furthermore, the resistance increasing velocity is also increased with decreasing line width. We defined the critical
void size as the resistance increase of via/line structure reaches 5%, 10%, 20% and 100% shift as summarized in Table 3. It
clearly shows that as metal width scales down, the critical void size is obviously decreased for reaching the same resistance

clean and without scrubber clean, stressing at 1.5 MA/cm2 current density, and 325oC 1.5 MA/cm2 current density, and 325oC.
II. Process stage/Moisture effect
In this test, we altered the scrubber clean stage and conducted before the deposition of SiCN film (that is, after the
completion the Cu CMP process). As shown in Fig. 18, the lifetime was greatly degraded for samples with scrubber clean
without any post-treatment procedure. Additionally, early failures (very short lifetime) was observed in this case. This suggests
that the Cu surface was oxidized by moisture as Cu is directly contacted with moisture. As a result, the bonding strength
between Cu and subsequent SiCN film was deteriorated, leading to a worse electromigration lifetime. It is worth to note that
this degraded electromigration lifetime can be improved by baking and reduction treatment procedures before SiCN capping
layer deposition. The baking and reduction treatment processes can be used to remove moisture and reduce oxidized Cu, thus
reinforcing the Cu interface. As seen, if the treatment process time is not enough, although the electromigration failure times
were improved, the failure times were still less than those without scrubber clean since the Cu interface was not completely
recovered to the original state. On the other hand, if providing enough baking and treatment processes on Cu surface, the failure
times can be promoted to the level of without scrubber clean, implying that moisture and oxidized Cu were removed
completely. The result is similar to the study by Takamasa et al. Also, this result points out the moisture did alter or deteriorate
the Cu/SiCN interface, leading to a lower electromigration resistance.
III. Pressure Cooker test/Moisture effect
Further investigate environment humidity effect on electomigration reliability, the process wafers (complete passivation
process) and package samples were subjected to pressure cooker test (PCT), which carried out at 120oC, 100% humidity and 2
atmosphere pressures for 168h, 500h, and 1000h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 19 for package samples with PCT stressing,
electromigration induced failure times are comparable, indicating that PCT stressing tests have no significantly influence on
electromigration reliability. The failure time trend of t50 as a function of PCT stressing time are also presented in the insert,
which also revealed that the electromigration failure times are independent on the PCT stressing time. Similar results were
observed for samples which PCT stressing test was performed before the wafer package.
IV. Sealing ring structure/Moisture effect
The test patterns shown in the above paragraphs have seal-ring walls located along the peripheral of test patterns. Based on
observed phenomena, no negative impact on electromigration behaviors for moisture permeation. However, a completely
different electromigration behavior was observed for samples with seal-ring and without seal-ring layouts demonstrated in Fig.
20. A structure without seal-ring revealed significant electromigration behavior degradation. The failure time was reduced by
the magnitude of ~3 times for samples without seal-ring layout. Additionally, the electromigration failure time distributions are
almost parallel for both structures, suggesting the similar failure mechanism. Furthermore, we performed EM tests with 3
different stressing temperatures to extract the activation energy (Ea). The plot of extracted activation energies (Ea) is inserted in
Fig. 20. The values are in the range of 0.90~0.92 eV, and no significant difference for both structures, which indicates Cu/ESL
interfacial diffusion dominated electromigration for structures with seal-ring and without seal-ring layout. This also points out
12
II. Mechanism for moisture effect on Electromigration
Before wafer die-sawing process, the penetration path of moisture is from top surface. As a result, if moisture did not
contact Cu surface directly, the moisture diffusion velocity is relatively low since low-k materials and SiCN capping layer were
still good moisture blockers. However, in the package processing to prepare electromigration samples, the scrubber clean with
jet clean was performed during wafer die-saw stage to remove the defect. After die-sawing, the lateral side of the samples is
considered to be another moisture diffusion path when subjected to the moisture environment. For electromigration testing
patterns without or cutting down seal-ring layout, the moisture can be easily penetrated into the test structure from the lateral
side and diffuse along the interface between Cu and capping layer as illustrated in Fig. 23. As illustrated, the vertical diffusion
path of moisture is still effectively blocked due to no existence of interface and better film barrier effect. Therefore, moisture
lateral diffusion is the dominated mechanism to cause the deteriorated Cu interface of the test patterns. On the other hand, in
case of samples with seal-ring layout, although the moisture can penetrate into the samples through the lateral side interfaces, it
will be blocked by the seal-ring structures and could hardly reach the interface of the test patterns. Therefore, the
electomigration behavior was not influenced by moisture.

Introduction- Electromigration has been recognized
as one of the most severe reliability concerns in
integrated circuits as the features of ICs are scaled
down to submicron dimension [1,2]. In order to
reduce electromigration effect, efforts have been
spent in the past years. One effective method is to
develop new material and investigate integration
processes which produce preferable properties,
such as copper interconnects fabricated by a
dual-damascene technology. Another approach to
improve the electromigration behavior is the
introduction of specific geometrical features, such
as material reservoirs [3,4] and redundant vias [5,6].
Althogh using two or more via contacts between
interconnect levels has been shown to be a
significantly promising geometrical strategy for
suppressing stress migration [4] and
electromigration [5-7], the mechanism and via
number effect on electromigration behavior are not
very clear. Consequently, it is necessary to quantify
the improvement and related mechanism in
electromigration reliability as a result of the
redundancy incorporated.
Experimental- The EM test structures with 250m
long metal length from 45 nm technology were
evaluated in this study as shown in Fig. 1. The via
number in the test structures was varied from 0 to 8.
The Cu interconnects were embedded in ultra-low-k
(k=2.5) dielectric and processed with a SiCN
capping layer. Both the metal width via dimension
are 0.07 m. The stress current density is 2.0
MA/cm2 at a fixed temperature of 300oC. A sample
size of 20-30 was used for each experiment.
Resistance increase with time was monitor until
failure. Failure criterion of 10 % resistance increase
was employed. The current supply is stopped at
30% increase in order to minimize the
electromigration damage to the Cu interconnects for
physical failure analysis.
Results and discussions- The stress current density
distribution on the tested system with redundant
vias is shown in Fig. 2. From the initial time (t=0) to
voiding nucleation time tnu, the operating vias can
share the current density flow equally if assuming
each via is identical. After the voiding nucleated and
grew up, the current density flow through each via
is related to unfailed vias, the relative resistance
degradation trends and relative voiding grow rate.
For a 2-via system, the current densities through
Via1 and Via2 is displayed in Fig. 3, supposing that
the resistance degradation of Via1 is higher than
that of Via2. Before the voiding nucleation time, the
current density in each via is 1 MA/cm2 for the
overall current density of 2 MA/cm2. After the
voiding nucleates and grows up in Via1, the
resistance of Via1 begins to increase and the
current density is decreased. As the resistance of
Via1 is increased to maximum value where current
density approaches zero, then, the current density
of Via2 reaches 2 MA/cm2. After Via1 failed, the
voiding induced failure rate of Via2 is accelerated
due to a higher current density so that the failure
time (TTF1) of Via1 is less than that of Via2 (TTF2).
The total failure time on the 2-via system can be
expressed by Eq. (1):
effect on the electromigration (EM) characteristics
of dual damascene Cu lines was investigated in this
study. The results revealed interesting differences
in electromigration behavior of electron
down-stream and up-stream flow directions. In
electron down-stream flow case, the failure time of
Cu lines without vias structure is longer than that
with vias structure, but the failure time is
independent of the via number. Higher current
density in triple junction site at the fatal via in the
possible mechanism. On the other hand, increasing
via number resulted in the higher EM lifetime and
reached saturated. These observed effects are
specific to Cu dual-damascene structures and can
have great technological implications in
electromigration improvement.

enough, although the electromigration failure times were
improved, the failure times were still less than those
without scrubber clean since the Cu interface was not
completely recovered to the original state. On the other
hand, if providing enough baking and treatment
processes on Cu surface, the failure times can be
promoted to the level of without scrubber clean,
implying that moisture and oxidized Cu were removed
completely. The result is similar to the study by
Takamasa et al. [6]. Also, this result points out the
moisture did alter or deteriorate the Cu/SiCN interface,
leading to a lower electromigration resistance.
The test patterns shown in the above paragraphs
have seal-ring walls located along the peripheral of test
patterns. Based on observed phenomena, no negative
impact on electromigration behaviors for moisture
permeation. However, a completely different
electromigration behavior was observed for samples with
seal-ring and without seal-ring layouts demonstrated in
Figure 5. A structure without seal-ring revealed
significant electromigration behavior degradation. The
failure time was reduced by the magnitude of ~3 times
for samples without seal-ring layout. Additionally, the
electromigration failure time distributions are almost
parallel for both structures, suggesting the similar failure
mechanism. Furthermore, we performed EM tests with 3
different stressing temperatures to extract the activation
energy (Ea). The plot of extracted activation energies (Ea)
is inserted in Fig. 5. The values are in the range of
0.90~0.92 eV, and no significant difference for both
structures, which indicates Cu/ESL interfacial diffusion
dominated electromigration [3, 7] for structures with
seal-ring and without seal-ring layout. This also points
out that the failure mechanism for samples without
seal-ring structures did not alter, but the failure rate or
voiding nucleation and growing-up velocity were
accelerated. The physical analysis of the failure samples
using scan-electron-microscopy (SEM) technology was
demonstrated this premise. As expected, the EM failure
mechanism is surface Cu atom diffusion and voiding
location is on the Cu/capping dielectric interface for the
tested sample without seal-ring layout shown in Figure 6.
This observation suggests that the seal- ring layout can
be a barrier wall against moisture penetration.
However, it is questionnaire that which step is a
moisture source to causes the degraded failure time? To
classify this issue, 2 experiments were performed on
structures with seal-ring and without seal-ring layouts.
The extra scrubber clean and PCT stressing was
conducted on low-k film deposition stage for
electromigration samples without seal-ring layout.
Similar to the previous result, the failure time is shorter;
however, these extra scrubber clean and PCT stressing
did not further degrade electromigration performance,
even for without seal-ring structures as demonstrated in
Fig. 5. This implies that in case of structures without
seal-ring layout, the moisture is not from the fabrication
processing, maybe from the package processing, such as
die-saw or bonding stage. To demonstrate this, the other
experiment was conducted on electromigration samples
with seal-ring layout, but we cut down seal-ring layout
during die-saw processing. The electromigration failure
time distributions were compared in Figure 7. A
surprising result was detected, which the failure times of
cutting down seal-ring structures are significantly
reduced, and similar to those of without seal-ring
structures. The results confirm that the degradation
electromigration failure time is a result of package
induced moisture penetration. Consequently, it needs to
pay more attention on moisture effect during the package
procedure as the test patterns do not contain seal-ring
structures.
Before wafer die-sawing process, the penetration
path of moisture is from top surface. As a result, if
moisture did not contact Cu surface directly, the moisture
diffusion velocity is relatively low since low-k materials
and SiCN capping layer were still good moisture
blockers. However, in the package processing to prepare
electromigration samples, the scrubber clean with jet
clean was performed during wafer die-saw stage to
remove the defect. After die-sawing, the lateral side of
the samples is considered to be another moisture
