2. Introduction 
Numerical solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is the prime subject in the field 
of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and many related fields in sciences and engineering. In 
the governing equations used to illustrate incompressible viscous flows, the momentum and 
continuity equations of the Navier-Stokes equations are coupled through the velocity, but the 
in terms of the curl of the velocity field.  However, a suitable method to calculate accurately the 
vorticity values at the boundary for vorticity formulations has not been fully resolved. The 
definition of vorticity is given by the curl of the velocity field and hence in order to correctly 
satisfy the vorticity definition at the boundary, computing the velocity gradients, in other words, 
the vorticity values at the boundary are very crucial. As indicated by the investigators [9, 10], in 
order to enforce the solenoidality of vorticity in the computation of flow problems, the vorticity 
transport equations have to be solved with the vorticity values at the boundary determined using 
the vorticity definition. 
In recent years, the DQ method is becoming a powerful numerical scheme to solve partial 
differential equations with higher-order accuracy compared to the conventional lower-order 
numerical techniques, such as the finite element and finite difference methods. The DQ method 
was first developed by Bellman et al. [11] to approximate the derivative of a smooth function 
using a higher order polynomial and has been successfully implemented for solving engineering 
problems [12-14]. Shu and Xue [13] applied generalized DQ method to simulate the natural 
convection in a square cavity. There are two boundary conditions (Dirichlet and Neumann type) 
for the stream function at each boundary discussed therein. Mixed-convection in a differentially 
heated enclosure is chosen as a test case to demonstrate the capability of the proposed numerical 
algorithm. The reason for selecting this problem is to prove the efficiency of the proposed 
coupled numerical scheme to solve governing equations for vortex dominated flow. Since the 
vorticity transport equations are coupled to the energy equation through the buoyancy force, we 
choose this problem to test the proposed coupled numerical algorithm. The four field variables, 
during computations. 
The contents of this project are organized as follows. Section 2 revisits the velocity-pressure 
forms (primitive variables) and velocity-vorticity forms of the governing equations for 2D 
viscous flow. Section 3 delineates the DQ method to discretize the governing Navier-Stokes 
equations in velocity-pressure forms and velocity-vorticity forms. The numerical results for some 
examples will be carried out in the final project. 
3. Methods 
3.1 Differential quadrature method 
The DQ method replaces a given spatial partial derivative of a function f(x) by a linear 
weighted sum of the function values at the discrete sample points considered along the coordinate 
direction. As a result, the given partial differential equations reduce to a set of algebraic equations. 
Hence the DQ method can be used to obtain numerical solution of partial differential equations. 
The details about this method can be found from elsewhere [11, 12]. For a function of two 
variables ( , )f x y  the l -th order derivatives and m -th order derivatives of the function with 
respect to x  and y  can be obtained as [12, 14]:

quantities in the above governing equations and later physical explanations. The ,u v  is the 
velocity in the ,x y− − direction, respectively. P  is the pressure, T  is the temperature. Gr is 
the Grashof number, Re is the Reynolds number, and Pr is the Prandtl number. The Richardson 
number defined as 2/ ReRi Gr=  is a characteristic number for the mixed convection process 
that indicates the relative dominance of the natural and forced convection effects. 
3.2.2 Velocity-vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations 
In the case of mixed convection problems, the momentum transport equation includes the 
driven force and buoyancy force generated as a result of fluid density difference caused by the 
temperature difference. The buoyancy term is computed based on the Boussinesq approximation. 
By taking the curl of the primitive variable form of governing equations for mixed convection 
As far as velocity-vorticity formulation is concerned, the corresponding vorticity values on the 
boundary can be obtained using the definition given by

flow. In order to achieve overall high efficiency during computations, the numerical scheme 
involved in the three-step DQ method are developed. The efficient technique for handling the

The velocity, vorticity and temperature boundary condition can be computed using equations 
(14-17). The simultaneous equations resulting from the global matrix system of equation (33) are 
solved using a bi-conjugate iterative equation solver. Since the coefficient matrix of the global 
matrix system is sparse, only the non-zero entries are stored in a column storage format. In the 
successive time step, we used the velocity, vorticity and temperature components at the previous 
time step as the initial guesses for the next iteration. The computations are carried out until steady 
state conditions are reached. The convergence criteria used in the time loop to achieve steady 
state conditions are

4. Results and Discussions 
4.1 The results of velocity-pressure formulation 
for predicating the heat transfer problems when the governing equations in velocity-pressure form 
are used as a fully coupled system of equations. 
4.2 The results of velocity-vorticity formulation 
The schematic diagram of the inclined cavity with the boundary conditions for the natural 
convection problem is displayed in Fig. 1. Temperatures equal to 1 and 0 are enforced on the hot 
wall at 0x =  and cool wall at 1x = , respectively. Numerical results obtained for the test 
problem are discussed in this section. 
One of the aims of the present numerical scheme is to show that the higher order polynomials 
for approximating the Navier-Stokes equations which require relatively a coarse mesh to achieve 
benchmark solutions. In order to validate the proposed model to solve the natural convection 
phenomenon in an inclined cavity, initially the grid independence study was carried out for 
Ra= 3 4 5 610 ,10 ,10 ,10  in a square cavity. The Nusselt number Nu  is one of the important 
dimensionless parameters in the natural convection problems. 
Further, in order to make sure that the grid independence study is in accordance with the other 
numerical results. For the mesh sensitivity study, the average Nusselt number values were 
calculated in 3 610 10Ra≤ ≤  with three different meshes of size ( 221 , 225  and 231 ). The value 
of Prandtl number was assumed as 0.71 for all computational cases. Numerical results of the 
Nussel number values with the different inclination angles of the cavity for Ra= 3 4 5 610 ,10 ,10 ,10  
were shown in Table 4. The decreasing trend of the Nusselt number values with increasing the 
inclination angle is vividly observed in the above table for the different Rayleigh numbers. With 
increase in the Rayleigh number, initially the convective currents are slowly set up in the flow 
because greater temperature gradients were observed only at these regions. As the other sides are 
kept adiabatic, the temperature contours are always perpendicular to these sides as observed in 
the above figures. Further the increase in the angles of inclination results in diagonally parallel 
isotherms instead of the nearly horizontal isotherms observed at 0φ = D . 
Natural convection in a differentially heated cavity at different angles of inclination involves a 
vortex-dominated flow. An important aspect of this problem is the fluid movement takes place 
purely due to the buoyancy forces generated due to the temperature difference between the end 
walls. The present velocity-vorticity formulation based on the DQ method requires only the 
velocity and the temperature boundary conditions to be specified on the cavity walls. To be 
precisely, the vorticity values at the boundary are computed implicitly in the proposed coupled 
formulation. The characteristics of the natural convection phenomenon can be well understood by 
plotting the temperature distributions on x y−  plane. This fact was verified by the expected 
results predicted by the present algorithm for the flow and the temperature fields. 
5 Conclusion 
Two different numerical algorithms have been proposed based on the DQ method was 
demonstrated for natural convection in a differentially heated inclined cavity. The natural 
convection process couples the temperature and the momentum equations, hence making the 
velocity, vorticity and temperature fields form a fully coupled system of equations. Since we 
propose a separate and coupled numerical solution algorithm, the coupled natural convection 
problem could be treated as a suitable test case to validate the present numerical scheme. 
Moreover, the present study was verified to be an efficient and robust algorithm to resolve the
