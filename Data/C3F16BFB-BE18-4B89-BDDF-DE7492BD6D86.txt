ABSTRACT 
We have successfully demonstrated a holographic memory in a single LiNbO3 crystal with two simultaneous 
but individual readout channels. A special scheduled exposure model is derived to obtain equal diffraction 
efficiency of each hologram in this memory. The simultaneous readout technique is achieved in a hybrid-
multiplexed memory using angular multiplexing and the polarization multiplexing. Polarization multiplexing 
offers the mechanism of simultaneous readout for two individual orthogonally polarized images. In each 
angular position of the holographic memory, these two orthogonally polarized images can be reconstructed 
simultaneously and each of them can be viewed independently. After our proposed scheduled exposure, 
experimental result of diffraction efficiency in each hologram becomes equal and the result is consistent with 
our prediction. 
Keywords: holographic storage, angle multiplexing, polarization multiplexing 
1. INTRODUCTION
Owing to large storage capacity and high access rate, holographic storage is an attaractive research topic [1-4]. 
Several multiplexing techniques have been developed for high-density holographic storage such as 
wavelength multiplexing [5-6], angular multiplexing [7], shift multiplexing [8] and polarization multiplexing 
[9-12]. In this paper we demonstrate a hybrid multiplexing using polarization multiplexing accompanied with 
angular multiplexing in a LiNbO3 crystal. We presented 200 hybrid-multiplexed plane holograms in a single 
crystal with 200 angular positions for angular-multiplexing. In each angular position of the holographic 
memory, two orthogonal polarized images are stored in the same spatial location. Exposure schedule of 200 
stored plane holograms for equal diffraction efficiency is theoretically analyzed and experimental verified in 
our transmission-type structure. 
2. BASIC SCHEME  
The basic scheme of a hybrid-multiplexed memory with two individual output channels for orthogonal 
polarization simultaneous readout is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) show the recording processes of 
the hybrid-multiplexed memory, and Fig. 1(c) is the simultaneous reconstruction process for the hybrid-
multiplexed holograms. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the first step of the recording process is using TE polarized 
reference beams and TE polarized signal beams to perform angle-multiplexed holograms in the recording 
medium. As shown here, the reference angle is changed with each hologram recording. In the second step of

In this configuration, the signal beams are normal incident on the crystal, and incident angle of the reference 
beam for recording both TM and TE polarized images is kept around o30  in the air. Angular selectivity in 
this recording configuration can be theoretically analyzed based on VOHIL model [12]. As shown in Fig.1, 
signal beam is normal incident on a LiNbO3 crystal and incident angle of reference beam is 300  in the air 
(internal angle Į=12.560).
The incident plane reference wave can be expressed as

In the reading process, when the angular deviation of reading beam is I' , the reading plane wave for the 
hologram becomes

In our experiments, 100 TE holograms and 100 TM holograms were recorded by hybrid-multiplexed in a 
LiNbO3 crystal. The angular deviation of reference beam was 0.060 for each recording. During the recording 
process, the shutters SH1 and SH2 were opened and SH3 was closed. The mirror M3 was setting on the 
rotation machine (Newport URM80PE), and be controlled by a driver (Newport ESP300). First, the reference 
beams and signal beams were both TE polarized. 100 holograms were angular multiplexed in the LiNbO3
crystal with the same exposure time tTE =1.75 second. After the recording process of 100 TE holograms was 
completed, the incident angle of reference beam was returned to the first angular recording position. And the 
polarizations of two recording beams were changed to TE polarized. 100 TM holograms were then sequential 
angular-multiplexed with the same exposure time tTM =0.8 second. The angular deviation of reference beam 
for recording TM hologram was also 0.060. Accordingly, for each incident angle of the reference beam, two 
holograms with orthogonal polarization are multiplexed in the same spatial location inside the LiNbO3 crystal.
