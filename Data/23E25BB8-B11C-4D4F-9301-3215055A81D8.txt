1. General Description of the Program 
This project is aim to establish the international corporations between the Japan and 
Taiwan for promoting the millimeter-wave standardizations on IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN 
(Wireless Personal Area Network). By making the Taiwan technology contents, 
including the mass-produced antenna array and 60 GHz CMOS RF chipsets, we expect 
solid contribution from Taiwan to the making of the IEEE 802.15TG3c wireless 
standard for WPAN capable of transmission of data over 2 GBPS (giga-bit per second). 
For developing the millimeter-wave (mmw) radio-frequency system-on-chip (SOC), 
the advanced integrated guiding structures had been investigated for miniaturization of 
RF signal-processing circuits in the RF SOC (system-on-chip). The guiding structure, 
which is so-called the complementary-conducting-strip transmission line (CCS TL), can 
be mass-produced by CMOS foundry process. The design methodologies of the CCS TL, 
has been developed and successfully applied to realize both passive and active 
key-components for the mmw transceiver ICs. The components include the 
double-balance active sub-harmonic mixer, broadside couplers, balun, power combiner, 
edge-coupled directional coupler, integrated active bandpass filter (ABPF), 180o hybrid. 
Those components can be applied to the transceiver realization with the various 
architectures, including the super-heterodyne with sub-harmonic, self-heterodyne, and 
direct conversion. 
2. Breakthrough and Major Achievements 
The technical proposals based on this project had been adopted in the “IEEE 
802.15.3c Call for Intent (CFI) Response” [IEEE 802.15-05/439/r7] for the international 
millimeter-wave WPAN standard. The proposal also actively involved in this standard 
conference and already obtained the Taiwan’s 1st voting right in IEEE 802.15.3c 
meeting, which enhanced the international impact of the program’s 60-GHz standard 
proposal. During the March and November 2006 meeting, two contributions were also 
reported. The second one “Millimeter-wave CMOS RFIC” [IEEE 802.15-06/475/r0] 
was selected as the major achievements among the November meeting. At July meeting 
on 2007, the proposals had been verified and approved by the WPAN TG3C committee. 
At September meeting, the proposals had been officially merged with the CoMPA, 
which is organized by Japanese government. Table I summarizes the key activities of 
IEEE 802.15.3c standardization meeting from 2005 to 2007.

Fig. 2 Chip photo of this 90nm CMOS DAT power amplifier with a chip size of 0.78 x 
0.82 mm2. The process provides single poly layer for the gates of the MOS and night 
metal layers for inter-connection. The CMOS transistor provides an fmax of 140 GHz at 
maximum-transconductance bias. A metal-insulator- metal (MIM) capacitor of 1fF/μm2 
has been developed using oxide inter-metal dielectrics. Two types of poly-silicon 
resistors, with several Ω/□ and kΩ/□, are provided by choosing the individual dose of 
ion-implantation separately from the gate electrode doping process. 
 
C. 30–100 GHz CMOS Sub-Harmonic Active Mixer 
Among the building blocks in MMW front-end, the mixer, which translates the 
radio frequency (RF) signals to and from intermediate frequency (IF) band, plays an 
important role. In conventional CMOS mixer designs, fundamental Gilbert-cell mixer 
with the advantages of good conversion gain, high spur suppression, and compact chip 
size, are widely used. Fig. 1 is the summary of the fully integrated wideband 
Gilbert-cell mixers in modern CMOS technologies. The operation frequency of the 
fundamental Gilbert-cell mixer has progressed along with the modern CMOS 
technologies from 180 nm to 90 nm. However the lack of high power and low phase 
noise local oscillation (LO) source in MMW, particularly above V-band, limit the 
performance and operation frequency of the fundamental mixer. Therefore the

D. CMOS Multilayer Complementary-Conducting-Strip Transmission Line (CCS TL) 
The complementary-conducting-strip transmission line (CCS TL) is constructed by 
the unit cell on the silicon substrate. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the unit cell, whose 
dimensions are much smaller than the guiding wavelength at the operating frequency, is 
the smallest element in the TL. The signal trace is composed of a central patch and two 
connecting arms, with the latter used to connect adjacent cells. However, the central 
patch and mesh ground plane can be constructed by using solid vias to link metals in a 
multilayer structure. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the thickness of the mesh ground plane is 
increased by stacking M1 to M5 in order to decrease the series resistance of the TL, thus 
enhancing the Q-factor of the CCS TL [14]. The unit cell in Fig. 4(a) shows a 
periodicity of P, and alternately combines two types of TLs shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c) 
to form a quasi-TEM TL. Fig. 4(b) displays a cross-sectional view of the A–A' cut, and 
clearly shows the well-known MS structure, which is locally a capacitive region from 
the circuit point of view. In contrast, Fig. 4(c) displays an MS with tuning septa, which 
can be regarded as an elevated CPW. Both microminiaturized guiding frameworks 
support the quasi-TEM mode, alternating to guide the EM energy, thus allowing 
arbitrary syntheses of the quasi-TEM TL with required characteristic impedance [14]. 
The central patch with a dimension W and the mesh ground plane of an inner slot with a 
dimension Wh form the complementary conducting surfaces. The term S denotes the 
width of the connecting arm, thus forming the so-called CCS TL. Furthermore, the 
values of the structural parameters, namely, P, Wh, S, W and the number of metal layer 
are restricted by the capability of the CMOS technology, which defines the minimum 
and maximum values of line space, line width, and number of metal layers. Hence, the 
proposed CCS TL design is scalable by following the continuing improvement of the 
semiconductor technology. Furthermore, the universal trends of synthesizing the desired 
guiding characteristics by adjusting the structural parameters of the CCS TL are 
reported in [14]. The CMOS CCS TL has been reported in detail. By following the 
universal design guidelines, the CCS TL can be designed with a wide range of 
characteristic impedance, high SWF, and the satisfaction of the metal density 
requirement. Additionally, when the physical length is fixed, the ratio of the CCS TL 
area to its corresponding Q-factor approaches a constant and can be applied to 
estimating the cost of loss for the CMOS circuit miniaturization.

Fig. 5. The unit cell of the complementary-conducting-strip coupled-line (CCS CL). 
 
 
The top-metal (M6) forms the signal traces of the edged-coupled line with the 
line-width and line-spacing of W and S. The bottom metals (M1-M4), which are the 
conducting sheets with the mesh area of Wh, behave as the ground plane of the CCS CL. 
Additionally, as shown in Fig. 2, the thickness of the mesh ground plane can be 
increased by stacking M1 to M4 with the conducting vias of Via12, Via23 and Via34. Such 
increase can be regarded as the decrease of the substrate thickness (h). The features 
mentioned above, including the size of the mesh area and the thickness of the ground 
plane can become the new design parameters of the proposed CCS CL for synthesizing 
the even-mode characteristic impedance (Z0e) and odd-mode characteristic impedance 
(Z0o). Such flexibility on even- and odd-mode impedance syntheses of the CCS CL 
explores the potential of the proposed CCS CL for designing the tight coupler without 
the extra process changing. Both theoretical and experimental characterizations of the 
proposed CCS CL are revealed in [15].  
 
F. Miniaturized Wilkinson Power Divider 
The on-chip CCS TL is theoretically investigated by full-wave EM simulations. The 
guiding properties of CCS TL, including complex propagation constant, characteristic 
impedance and quality factor, are extracted from the EM results and reported in [15] for 
the power divider design.

resistor, which is realized by the on-chip poly lines. On the other hand, the size of 
prototype, which is realized only by CCS TL and requiring resistor, is 210.0 μm × 390.0 
μm without contact pads. Such device has high potential on the application of CMOS 
RF system-on-chip (SOC). 
G. CMOS 180o Hybrid 
Figure 7(a) shows a 34.3 GHz CMOS rat-race hybrid design incorporating the 
proposed CCS TLs designed according to the guidelines reported in Section III of [14]. 
The chip area of the prototype shown in Fig. 7(a) is 420.0 μm × 540.0 μm without the 
contact pads. Fig. 7(b) shows the composite plots, revealing good agreements between 
the measurements and HFSS simulations. The transmission coefficients, which are 
shown in Fig. 7(b) in detail, are less than 4.0 dB from 34.0 to 38.0 GHz, indicating the 
intrinsic loss of less than 1.0 dB. Additionally, the two transmission coefficients in Fig. 
7(b) are -3.94 and -3.75 dB at 34.3 GHz, showing imbalance amplitude of 0.19 dB. 
Such results show a nearly equal power distribution at two output ports of the prototype. 
The measured input return loss from 32.8 to 38.1 GHz, illustrated by the curve with 
hollow squares, is higher than 20.0 dB.

Fig. 8(b) shows the comparisons between the simulated and measured results. As 
shown in Fig. 8(b), the solid traces represent the HFSS simulations and symbols 
represent the measured results. The circle symbol shows the measured input return loss 
of the prototype is higher than 10.0 dB from 0.1 GHz to 40.0 GHz and has a maximum 
value of 29.7 dB at 24.9 GHz. The triangle symbol shows the measured isolation keep 
the minimum value of 20 dB from 0.1 GHz to 40 GHz. Additionally, the measured 
results of the insertion loss (square symbol) and coupling (triangle symbol) show 
excellent agreements with that of HFSS simulations, showing 3.57 dB and 5.51 dB at 
35.3 GHz. Furthermore, the insertion loss and coupling of the prototype based on results 
of the HFSS simulations and measurements, showing less than 1.0 dB difference. Such 
excellent agreements demonstrate the concept of the proposed CCS CL and its 
feasibility on the design of the 3-dB directional coupler using standard CMOS 
technology.

Fig. 10 Chip photo of the multilayer TL -based power divider. 
Two CCS TLs with different superstrate layers make the differences of SWFs of two 
CCS TLs. In order to overcome this issue, setting different numbers of unit cells of TL1 
and TL2 to control the quarter-wavelength of two CCS TLs at the same frequency is 
necessary. Thus, the upper CCS TL (TL1) is consisted of 34 unit cells and lower CCS 
TL (TL2) is consisted of 28 unit cells. The active chip area of the prototype shown in 
Fig. 10 is 180.0 μm × 180.0 μm (excluding contact pads). Fig. 11 shows the 
comparisons between the measured and simulated results of the proposed power divider, 
revealing an excellent agreement in return losses of the power divider from 30.0 GHz to 
40.0 GHz. When operating at a center frequency of 34.2 GHz, the power divider 
exhibits the simulated insertion losses (S21 and S31) of 4.59 dB and 4.65 dB for 3.0 dB 
power coupling, showing an amplitude in-balance of 0.06 dB. The simulated bandwidth, 
corresponding to return loss better than 15.0 dB, of power divider is 29.2 %. Within this 
bandwidth, the intrinsic loss of the design maintains lower than 1.7 dB. The isolation 
between two output ports, crossed port 2 and port 3, is also shown in Fig. 11. The 
isolation of the power divider achieves maximum value of 20.7 dB from 38.3 GHz to 
39.5 GHz. On the other hand, the measured return losses are better than 10.0 dB from 
30.0 GHz to 40.0 GHz and the measured insertion losses are 5.01 dB and 5.5 dB, 
showing an amplitude in-balance of 0.49 dB.

The theoretical data is calculated by t HFSS simulations with the circuit layout shown 
in Fig. 12. Fig. 13 shows the simulated and measured S-parameters and phase difference 
of the proposed multilayer rat-race hybrid versus frequency. As shown in Fig. 13, the 
simulated input return loss is higher than 20.0 dB from 29.4 GHz to 41.3 GHz with a 
bandwidth of 34.7 %. When operating at a center frequency of 34.3 GHz, the rat-race 
hybrid exhibits the simulated insertion losses (S21 and S31) of 4.80 dB and 4.98 dB for 
3.0 dB power coupling, showing an amplitude in-balance of 0.18 dB. The isolation 
which is also shown in Fig. 13 achieves a maximum value of 17.8 dB at 33.3 GHz and 
17.7 dB at center frequency. From 31.4 GHz to 37.3 GHz, the phase difference between 
port 2 and port 3 is about 1800 ± 100. Fig. 13 also plots the measured S-parameters and 
phase difference of the prototype versus frequency and shows an excellent agreement 
with the theoretical data. At a center frequency of 35.0 GHz, the measured S21 and S31 
are 5.6 dB and 4.36 dB, and the isolation achieves a maximum value of 26.1 dB. From 
33.8 GHz to 36.7 GHz, the phase difference between port 2 and port 3 is about 1800 ± 
100. Furthermore, by referring the calculation of the area reduction factor (ARF) 
reported in [16], the prototype shown in Fig. 12 achieves ARF of 98.3% at 35.0 GHz.

Fig. 14. Chip photo of the second-order CCS-TL-based active bandpass filter. 
Fig. 15(a) is drawn with insertion and return losses of the active bandpass filter, 
which is measured using a vector network analyzer through on-wafer probing. The 
small signal experiments are performed after the short-open-load-through (SOLT) 
calibration procedures to eliminate the parasitic of the signal-ground (SG) pads. 
Through Q-enhancement, the bandpass filter achieves 0-dB insertion loss. The center 
frequency of the prototype is 34.2 GHz with a bandwidth of 18.8%. The tuning voltage 
(Vtun) and supply voltage (VDD) of the filter are 1.25 V and 1.8 V with a total supply 
current of 4.42 mA and DC power consumption of 3.7 mW. Fig. 15(b) shows the 
measured results based on different biasing conditions of the bandpass filters. The 
measured frequency responses of the proposed bandpass filter with tuning voltage (Vtun) 
of 0 V, 1.25 V, and 1.4 V. The tuning voltage of zero-V reveals the intrinsic passive 
loss of the bandpass filter and the tuning voltage of 1.4 V indicates the filter gain of 
1.23 dB. As shown in Fig. 16, with Vtun = 1.25 V and VDD = 1.8 V, the measured input 
1-dB compression point (P1dB) of the prototype is -4.6 dBm at center frequency of 34.2

L. System Application: 1.5-Gbps Wireless HDTV Demostration 
The major application of 60-GHz bands is the wireless HDTV products, which 
provides an alternative wireless connection for next generation Blu-ray Disc (BD). To 
build a platform for system demonstration, NTU have a cooperation activity with the 
HDTV research institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University. The professional HDTV 
signal, HD-SDI, is generated through RAID and HD-SDI interface and 
down-converted by HD-SDI-to-DVI interface for 1920 x 1080p HDTV display. 
Using the 40-GHz transceiver modules from previous NSC project, a 1.5-Gigabit 
uncompressed HDTV signal has been successfully transmitted in March 2008. This is 
the first demonstration of uncompressed wireless HDTV in Taiwan.

會議地點: 美國, 亞特蘭大 
會議時間: 2007 November 11-20 
心得報告:  
This is the final standard proposal voting for 
IEEE 802.15.TG3c 60-GHz WPAN standard 
committee. The title of National Taiwan 
University’s proposal is “Dual-Mode 
Broadband and Wireless Network 
(DMBWN)” (IEEE 802.15-07/0692r0), 
which has been merged with the main 
proposal IEEE 802.15-07/0934r1. The world 
largest 802.15.3c consortium, COMPA, 
successfully creates a joint proposal to merge 
two remaining Proposals (after 2007/09 
Hawaii meeting), which is IEEE 
802.15-07/0934r1 and IEEE 
802.15-07/0942r2. Confirmation Roll Call 
vote was carried and confirmed. The 
threshold of any IEEE 802 standard proposal 
is 75%, but the merged proposal gain 87% 
support according to the voting results. There 
are total of 110 votes in the final voting 
process. Many people from other 
802.15/802.11 sub-committee join the voting 
process to support their own company’s 
interests. Subtracting 10 abstained votes, the 
effective votes are 100 as shown below. The 
87% support means 87 votes agree on the 
merged proposal. Therefore the merged 
proposal passes the final voting to start the 
standard drafting process.  
 
TG3c Proposal Confirmation Vote (07/934r1 
+ 07/942r2)

     No:  13    (13%) 
 Abstain:  10 
Total vote:  110 
Proposal was confirmed 
 
There are two interesting observations from 
standard voting: (1) If you have 25% votes in 
your side, then the other side need to listen to 
your opinion carefully, otherwise the final 
vote can not pass the IEEE 802 voting 
threshold. (2) The remaining two proposals 
support two different applications: one is 
low-power single carrier, and the other is

Conference (ISSCC) at San Francisco, USA. 
During the ISSCC meeting, two complete 
CMOS transceiver are demonstrated. The 
title of first presentation is “A 90nm CMOS 
60GHz Radio”, which is from Georgia

present the highest data rate of 15 Gigabit at 
60-GHz wireless communication, which is 
using the full band of 7 GHz bandwidth at 
57-64 GHz.  
 
 
The most impressive feature is the 
low-power performance of less than 50 pJ/bit. 
NTU’s CMOS transceiver (4Gbps and 
97mW) has the similar performance 
 
The title of second presentation is “TX and 
RX Front-Ends for the 60GHz Band in 90nm

訪問地點: 中國，上海 
訪問時間: 2007 December 6-9 
心得報告:  
This trip is the first meeting with 
Shanghai Jiaotong University. We share our 
vision about converting the HDTV signal to 
millimeter-wave and then transmitted with a 
wireless link to implement a Gigabit 
Wireless HDTV demonstration system. 
Shanghai Jiaotong University show us 
their research on HDTV from their China 
standard development to the implementation 
of HDTV in their own technologies. They 
have a company, Shanghai High-Definition 
Tech., which is working on the 
High-Definition editing system for 
JPEG2000 with lossless/lossy compression. 
The maximum lossless compression rate is 
4:1, so it is necessary to have a high-speed 
gigabit link between HD signal generator 
and receiver. So it is clear for our future 
research to focus on the professional 
uncompressed HDTV signal transmission 
and receiving. 
The HDTV system in their lab is a 
professional high-definition TV system, 
which is similar to the professional studio 
equipments inside China TV station. Because 
the price for the professional HD camcorder 
is too high for our project, so we ask about 
an affordable HDTV signal generation and 
display system.  
 
HDTV Source as following:  
1. For video testing purpose, tektronics 
offer TG2000/TG700 with HD-SDI 
module, price at 200,000-300,000 RMB. 
2. Video Clarity, price ~300,000 RMB. 
3. PC interface cards: AJA (kona), or 
Blackmagic (Decklink) 
 
HDTV receiver as following: 
1. Sony 14” HDTV monitor <100,000 
RMB 
2. PROV (夏華) 20” HD-SDI HDTV < 
20,000-30,000 RMB.

心得報告:  
This trip is focus on the detailed low-cost 
HDTV equipment list discussion. The main 
concern is the price for the HDTV generation 
equipment, so we choose to build our own 
HDTV source with PC interface card. 
Nevertheless, we didn’t find that the 
high-speed HDTV data stream (10GB per 
minute) cannot be generated from a single 
hard driver due to the limited hard driver 
data link speed. Therefore, we need RAID 
(hard driver disk array) with 4 to 8 disk and 
parallel data output to fulfill the HDTV 
high-data requirement. This is a hidden black 
hole that needs our cooperation institute to 
instruct us to do the right way in a economic 
HDTV video generation system, that is very 
important for our future success 
demonstration.

心得報告:  
This trip is to visit the vendor in 
Shanghai for the HD-SDI converter. We try 
to select the low-cost HDTV source and 
receiver, but we need also the good quality 
video. The vendor Blackmagic in Shanghai 
brought us to a professional video studio 
who is using the Blackmagic’s Decklink 
products in their professional video 
production. This studio has a video room 
similar to Movie Theater which has a large 
screen display to see very clear HD video. 
This is a quite impressive demonstration 
about the Blackmagic’s Decklink products, 
especially in a real movie & video industry 
show room. Therefore Shanghai Jiaotong 
University makes decision to purchase 
Blackmagic’s Decklink products for their 
wireless HDTV demonstration.

Fig. 2 Blackmagic’s Decklink receiver 
 
We also tests Blackmagic’s Decklink 
product in Shanghai Jiaotong University, but 
we found out that the computer setup is not 
straight forward as other PC product. 
Therefore, the  
Blackmagic’s sales help us to setup the 
system, which is a good experience to share 
with NTU students who are doing 
installation.

observed in coax-line wired test.  
 
These experience results give us an 
important learned lesson about international 
cooperation, which is a must to verify the 
equipment capability first, even under the 
same vendor and with the same model 
number. You cannot assume that the same 
vendor produce same equipment under 
different country’s business environment.

心得報告:  
We have cooperation with the 
Microwave / Millimeter-wave test equipment 
vendor, Agilent, in Shanghai. They provide 
us two microwave CW signal generators and 
one millimeter-wave spectrum analyzer, 
which is essential for a complete wireless 
HDTV system test. All the base-band HDTV 
signal source and receiver are provided by 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University. National 
Taiwan University has the millimeter-wave 
Gigabit digital modulator, power amplifier 
and antennas.  
 After the success of wireless HDTV test 
on last time, Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
wants to have a video taping of our detailed 
cooperation project for their future funding 
applications. Another motivation of this test 
is to refine our wireless HDTV system to see 
any possibility of non-line-of-sight 
transmission. So we select Agilent’s 
Shanghai office as a normal office test 
environment. The most time consuming part 
of this test is to prepare the test equipment 
and to arrange the office environment. Fig. 1 
shows the non-line-of-sight wireless HDTV 
with a single reflection.
