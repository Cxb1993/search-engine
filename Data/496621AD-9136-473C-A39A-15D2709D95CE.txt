Based on the both techniques of PDIS and environment immunity that we have reported 
in the reference papers [5, 9], we concentrate on the research of fiber-optics interferometric 
multiplexed current sensors for monitoring electrical currents in this paper. We propose two types 
of simplified sensor structure to make the FOCSs approaching a practical design for development 
of multiplexed current sensors.  With the measured currents of frequency converters, sensor 
responses of the different operating frequencies can be analyzed directly by the first type of the 
multiplexed current sensor. The second type of the multiplexed current sensor is proposed to 
monitor the power lines with same operating frequency by means of the unique combination of 
the PDIS and time division multiplexing (TDM) technique [10, 11]. In spite of this, the light 
power budgets and the installation criteria of optical amplifiers in the sensor system still need to 
be studied experimentally for both enhancements of sensitivities and amounts of the sensor head. 
Meanwhile, we use the commercialized low-birefringence fiber to replace the twisted fibers 
which are hand-made fibers in our laboratory [5] to improve the sensor sensitivities. 
 
三、系統設計及操作原理 
The schematic diagrams of the proposed multiplexed current sensors by using the PDIS and the 
combination of PDIS with TDM are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. Fiber-optics pigtailed 
devices are used in this experiment to avoid additional losses of light power. A broadband light 
source with a 3-dB bandwidth covering from 1520 to 1560nm is used in this sensor system. The 
residually linear polarization of this broadband light source is scrambled by a depolarizer to 
suppress the interference noise which may generate from the return loss of fiber-optics devices in 
order to make the sensor responses approach shot noise. Next to the depolarizer, a 3-dB coupler 
or a 3–port circulator is used to guide the light wave from the light source into the lead fiber to 
the sensor heads while getting the reflected light wave from the sensor heads into the 
photo-detector.  
Following the circulator or coupler, a polarizer is used to generate a linearly-polarized 
light wave to get into the polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) with respect to its birefrigent 
azimuth angle of 045 . This produces two linearly orthogonal modes with equal parts of power. 
The PMF with length of 60-cm has been calculated to comply with the optical path differences 
between the orthogonal modes which became decorrelative to result in the suppression of the 
interference noises that are caused by the imperfect return losses of devices. Furthermore, a 
quarter-wave retarder, made of a 1-mm long PMF, is connected with the PMF at birefringent 
azimuth angle of 045  to generate two orthogonal modes with circularly-polarized states. When 
the light waves reflect from the mirrors at the ends of each sensor heads, the retarder transforms 
the orthogonal modes from circular to linear polarization states. The two linearly orthogonal 
modes of light waves then propagate backward along the exchanged birefringent axes of the PM 
fiber. 
When the light waves go back to the polarizer, the phase differences of both modes 
become reciprocal compensations resulting in a coherent condition. The projections of both 
reflected light waves on the polarizer’s optical axis then produce interferences. Based on the 
Faraday effect, the sensor heads will get nonreciprocal responses which create the phase 
differences between both orthogonal modes. These two modes will then result in interference 
signals modulation. Finally, using a Faraday rotator with the specified rotation angle of 05.22  as 
an in-line fiber passive demodulation to create the phase-difference biasing of both orthogonal 
modes to / 2π which qualifies the sensor in the quadrature condition for linearly demodulating.  
The mathematical model of the FOCS with the PDIS technique for single sensor head can 
be expressed as [5] 
0[1 sin 4 ]FI I θ= + .                 (1) 
The interference intensity I as a function of Fθ , the induced signal based on the Faraday effect, is 
very small (about 310− radian). Hencesin 4 Fθ  will be approximatly 4 Fθ . The electrical current 
induces a magnetic field along the optical fiber that resulted in additional rotation angle of the 
state of polarization (SOP) of the light wave. And given by

amplification. Under these experimental conditions, it is proven that at least 2 pieces of sensor 
head are able to simultaneously measure the power lines with different operating frequencies.   
To monitor the separated power lines with the same operating frequency simultaneously, 
the unique combination of PDIS and TDM utilized for this multiplexing sensor system is able to 
accurately discriminate the responses of each sensor heads. The experimental results for both 
confirmations of synchronization and linearity, as shown in Fig.5, shows the two sensor 
responses almost getting the same level under the same condition of every electrical current 
adjusted step. In addition, it indicates that both sensors having very good linearity responses, 
which can be calculated to the responsivities near 0.0696mV/Apmere-turns and 
0.0683mV/Ampere-turns, respectively for sensor-1 and sensor-2. These results are 2.7 dB better 
than the value of 0.051mV/Ampere-turns in our previous report. [9] This enhancement is 
achieved by using the high power broadband light source and the low birefringence of the sensing 
fiber. Furthermore, if a booster amplifier is put after the superluminencent diode, we can get the 
output power of the light source up to 120mW. The multiplexed sensor then is able to get the low 
noise floor of response spectrum. If a pre-amplifier is put before the photodetector, the noise floor 
will become 10 dB worse than the result using the booster. If an in-line amplifier is installed into 
the sensors, the specified optics functions of the special fibers will be totally destroyed.   
In Fig.6, while operating the current at constant intensity of 900-Ampere-turns for 
sensor-1, we increase the current intensities of stepping from 900-Ampere-turns to 
3600-Ampere-turns for sensor-2. The diagram indicates that sensor-2 affects the response of 
sensor-1 at about 0.002mV/Ampere-turns deviation. The reason is that the MZ modulator has 
totally destructive interferences at specified wavelength with narrow linewidth. As to the 
broadband light source, the wavelength-dependent destructive-interferences will then pass some 
residue light power while the MZ modulator is generating the square-waveform carriers at low 
power level. Besides, the extinction rations of MZ modulators are typically less than 30-dB for 
commercial specifications. Therefore, the residue light power will inject into the sensor array 
continuously and gives rise to crosstalk between sensors. This crosstalk is likely to increase as the 
number of sensors increases.  
The AO modulator, with the typical extinction ration more than 50dB (Brimrose 
Company), is a kind of wavelength-independent dark-field modulator so that it can be used as a 
shutter; when it is shut down there will be no passing of any light power. Although the insertion 
loss of the modulator is wavelength-dependent while the shutter is open, the square-waveform 
carriers have averaged power of the broadband light source as their high-level signals with no 
crosstalk effect. Therefore, replacing the MZ modulator with the AO modulator should reduce the 
crosstalk effectively. The result can be seen clearly in Fig. 7, while operating the current at 
constant intensity of 450-Ampere-turns for sensor-1, we increase the current intensities of 
stepping from 450-Ampere-turns to 1800-Ampere-turns for sensor-2. The diagram indicates that 
the crosstalk is successfully reduced 20dB less than the MZ modulator. 
The sensor responses are reported in terms of millivolt. This is an output parameter that is 
also affected by electronics amplifier gain. Basically, the signal of the Farady effect in regular 
optical fibers is very weak and usually needs additional electronics amplifier. In this paper, we 
used a high power of broadband light source with an output power of 120mW. It can effectively 
enhance the signal to noise ratio. While the measured current is operating at fixed intensity, the 
FOCS has fine tuning on both optics and electronics amplifiers to avoid the saturation of 
electronics amplifier. The experimental result shows that the FOCS, without the electronics 
amplifier, can suppress the noise floor to 10dB lower than the FOCS with 1000 times of 
electronics amplifier gain. Thus the signal to noise ratio of the sensor is also enhanced up to 10dB. 
As for the other sensor performances regarding stability, linearity, and vibration sensitivity, it has 
been detailed discussed in our previous paper [5, 9]. 
Although the FOCS uses two sensor heads for experimental confirmations of multiplexed 
sensor performance, the two sensor structures suggested in Fig.1 and Fig.2 can both achieve good 
uniformity and trivial cross-talk effect as shown in the experimental results of Fig.4 and Fig.7 
respectively. The FOCS using the passively demodulated scheme also takes all the advantages of 
all fiber optics in-line structure, it can work with high voltage insulation and without the need of
