Abstract 
This research project is focusing on the growth of a uniform and homogeneous self- 
assembled quantum dot (QD) array by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).  The method is 
using e-beam lithography and ICP-RIE dry etching to form a nano-patterned substrate, and to 
grow the QDs in the array of pitches.  We have accomplished following results. (1) We have 
obtained a minimum writing linewidth of 50nm and a maximum writing range of 
500×500µm2 in our electron-beam lithography system. Pitch arrays of 100nm pitch-diameter 
and 100nm separation have been formed on 100×100µm2 semiconductor substrates. The 
etching depth of patterned GaAs and InP substrates are 70 nm and 45 nm, respectively. (2) 
We have also studied the opto-electric properties of InGaAsN single- and 
double-quantum-well (SQW and DQW) structures by Photocurrent, and Electro-absorption 
spectroscopy. The DQW structure shows an additional enhancement in electroabsorption of a 
maximum Δα ~ 14400 cm-1, which is 2.6 times larger than the maximum Δα ~ 5400 cm-1 of 
the SQW sample. (3) InxGa1-xAs (x=0.5~0.75) QD’s of high density of 1.3×1011 cm-2 and 
uniform size (diameter ~ 23-nm and height ~ 4-nm) were obtained by MBE. λ=1.3 μm 
emission was observed for In0.65Ga0.35As QD’s capped with In0.1Ga0.9As. (4) We have 
investigated the polarization effect of optical process in the vertically coupled InGaAs 
quantum dots (QDs) triple layers by varying the thickness of GaAs spacer layer.  The 
TE/TM ratio for the ground state emission decreases from near 4 to 1.5 as the spacer 
thickness decreases from 40 nm to 5 nm.  The TE polarization (in-plane polarization) is 
anisotropic with a stronger component along [011] direction.

3. Photocurrent and electro-absorption spectra of InGaAsN well 
The dilute nitride InGaAsN/GaAs structures provide an alternative material system to 
InGaAsP/InP for photonic devices in λ = 1.3-1.6 μm fiber communication.  Recently, 
high-performance diode lasers of edge-emitting type and VCSEL have been demonstrated.  
However, very few works have been reported on the electroabsorption (EA) modulation 
characteristics of the InGaAsN quantum well structures.  In this paper, we have measured 
the photocurrent (PC) and electro-absorption (Δα) spectra of an InGaAsN single- and a 
double-well structure at different reverse bias.  The change of the refractive index (Δn) was 
obtained by calculating the Δα spectra through Kramers-Krönig transform.  
The samples were of p-i-n structures grown by MBE.  The single-quantum-well (SQW) 
structure is of 60 Å In0.38GaAsN0.021 quantum well sandwiched by GaAsN barriers.  The 
double-quantum-well (DQW) structure consists of two 60 Å In0.38GaAsN0.021 quantum wells 
separated by a 200 Å GaAsN layer.  Both samples exhibit a single PL peak near λ = 1.20 
μm at room temperature.  For the photocurrent and Δα measurements, the samples were 
fabricated in mesa type by photolithography and wet etching.  A 250 μm-diameter window 
of shallow rectangular trench array was formed on the p-type surface to facilitate optical 
transmission and reduce Fabry-Perot interference.  The metal electrodes were formed on the 
p-type GaAs contact layer and the n-type GaAs substrate.  The photocurrent spectra were 
obtained by lock-in technique at room temperature.  We combined a tungsten lamp and a 
monochromator to provide the light source.  A half of the light beam was split off as a 
reference signal by a beam splitter.  The other half was focused in a spot of diameter less 
than 100 μm on the sample.  For the Δα spectra, the data were measured in a surface normal 
configuration biased by a square wave generator.  To ensure a good accuracy for the Δn 
spectra by Kramers-Krönig transform, the Δα spectra were taken over a wide range of λ from 
1.0 to 1.65 μm to include all the significant spectral features.   
Room-temperature PC spectra at different reverse bias are shown in Fig. 5 and 6 for the 
SQW and DQW structures, respectively.  Both samples show the e1-hh1 excitonic 
absorption edge and red shift by quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE).  The Δα spectra, 
which directly measured the change of transmission in the presence of square-pulsed reverse 
bias, are shown in Fig. 7 and 8.  The DQW sample has a maximum Δα ~ 14400 cm-1, which 
is 2.6 times larger than the maximum Δα ~ 5400 cm-1 of the SQW sample.  Thus, the 
electroabsorption is additionally enhanced for the DQW structure.  The differential 
refraction (Δn) spectra, shown in Fig. 9 and 10, were obtained by calculating the Δα spectra 
through Kramers-Kronig transform.

for 1 min to still obtain a c(4×4) surface. Following, InGaAs QD’s with thickness of 1.5 θc is 
then deposited. Three InGaAs QD’s samples without GaAs cap are grown for atomic force 
microscope (AFM) measurement. Sample A is 8.1 ML In0.5Ga0.5As QD’s at growth rate of 
0.18 ML/sec. Sample B is 5.2 ML In0.65Ga0.35As QD’s at growth rate of 0.14 ML/sec. Sample 
C is 3.4 ML In0.75Ga0.25As QD’s at growth rate of 0.12 ML/sec. Another three samples are 
directly capped by 10 nm GaAs at 480℃ with no growth interruption. After Ts ramped to 
580℃ at rate of 50℃/min and annealed for 1 min, the following 20 nm GaAs is capped 
again. Samples with 30 nm GaAs cap is named by D, E and F for InxGa1-xAs QD’s, x = 0.5, 
0.65 and 0.75, respectively. Another two In0.65Ga0.35As QD’s samples are grown at Ts = 510
℃ instead of 480℃ for higher emission efficiency at RT operation, are capped by 10 nm 
GaAs for sample H and In0.1Ga0.9As for sample K. 
    Figure 11 shows the High-resolution AFM images of sample A, B and C at area of 1 × 1 
μm. The average widths are 22, 23, and 23 nm; average heights are 4, 4 and 6 nm; and 
average density are 1.0×1011, 1.3×1011 cm-2, 8.1×1010 cm-2, in samples A, B and C, 
respectively. With θc decreasing due to higher In-content, the average size and density of 
these dots of 1.5 θc are almost the same under optimum growth condition controlled. Figure 
12 shows the normalized low-temperature photoluminescence LT-PL (10 K) spectra of the 
samples with GaAs cap. The peak wavelengths of these samples are 1056, 1046 and 1100 nm 
for D, E and F, respectively. The linewidth is 44 and 53 meV for samples D and E. Sample F 
has the smallest linewidth 38 meV. In addition, the temperature-dependent PL shows the 
linewidth of these samples is 37 ~ 53 meV at range of 10 K ~ 150 K. Strong and sharp LT-PL 
spectrum demonstrates efficient carrier capture and homogeneously heterostructure interface. 
Figure 13 shows the RT-PL of sample H and K. The emission peak of sample H is located  
at 1.25 μm , but sample K with In0.1Ga0.9As cap is red shift to 1.3 μm.

5. Optical polarization in vertically coupled InGaAs quantum dots  
Vertically stacked quantum dots (QDs) provide the favorable optoelectronic 
characteristics for the fabrications of photonic devices. For the applications in lightwave 
communications, such as semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and electro-absorption 
modulators (EAMs), polarization-insensitive response for the photonic devices is of 
considerable interests.  Conventionally, combinations of compressive- and tensile-strained 
multiple quantum wells have been demonstrated to achieve the polarization insensitivity.  
For self-assembled InGaAs QDs grown on (100) GaAs substrates, the island structures are 
under biaxially compressive strain individually.  Therefore, transverse-electric (TE) mode 
[i.e., polarization along the in-plane direction] is expected for the fundamental transition 
between heavy-hole and electron subbands.  To increase the transverse–magnetic (TM) 
component [i.e., polarization along the growth direction] for the fundamental transition, 
vertically coupled QDs layers were investigated to relax the strain deformation potential, 
and/or to increase the mixing of heavy-hole (hh) and light-hole (lh) subbands in the ground 
state. Here, we show the polarization effect of optical process in the vertically coupled 
InGaAs QDs layers by varying the thickness of GaAs spacer layer.   
Fig. 14 shows the schematic structure of the vertically stacked triple QDs layers, and the 
configuration for TE/TM photoluminescence (PL) measurement. The triple-layer QDs 
samples were grown on n+-GaAs (100) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The 
self-assembled In0.75Ga0.25As QDs were of 3.4 ML coverage at a growth rate of 0.1ΜL/sec.  
After the growth of QDs at substrate temperature (Ts) of 510°C, a 10-nm In0.1Ga0.9As capping 
layer was directly grown on the QDs at the same Ts.  Then, the Ts was raised to 580°C for 
the growth of GaAs spacer layer.  The spacer layer thicknesses for the samples were 40nm, 
20nm, and 5nm, respectively.  For the p-type MD samples, we added Be dopants of 2x1018 
cm-3 at the 2-nm-thick center region in the GaAs spacers.  The triple-layer QDs structures 
were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and QDs density is ~ 1.4 x 1010 
cm-2 per layer.  For the sample of 5-nm spacer layers, the QDs at upper layers have the same 
positions as those at the bottom QDs layer.  Polarized PL measurement was carried out at 
room temperature by rotating the polarizer to distinguish the polarization components for the 
edge emitting PL signal.  In addition to the TM component of polarization along [100] 
direction, the two orthogonal TE components of polarizations along [011] and [011] were 
measured. 
For the QDs sample of 40-nm spacer layers, the TE/TM PL spectra are shown at the top 
part of Fig. 15.   The PL peak is at λ ~ 1280 nm for the TE-dominated ground state 
emission.  The TE/TM ratio (r) of the ground state emission is 4.3 for [011]/[100], and 3.5 
for [011]/[100], respectively.  The higher r value for the [011]/[100] ratio compared to 
[011]/[100] ratio shows that the QDs have an anisotropy for the in-plane polarizations with a 
stronger component along [011] direction.  As the spacer layer thickness decreases, the 
TE/TM ratio decreases.  The r values are 3.1 of [011]/[100] and 2.9 of [011]/[100] for the 
QDs sample of 20-nm spacer layers, and 1.6 and 1.5 for the QDs sample of 5-nm spacer 
layers, respectively.  The decrease of r values is related to the increase of TM polarization 
by the vertical coupling for the QDs.  The vertical coupling enhances the mixing of hh and 
lh components in the ground state, and also relax the compressive strain.  Therefore, the TM 
component increases for the ground state emission from the strong vertical coupling sample.  
For the 5-nm spacer sample, the value of r~1.5 indicates that the lh component takes a part of 
37.5% in the ground state, as an estimation by considering the strength of optical transition 
matrix element for hh and lh.

6. Summary 
We have accomplished following results. (1) We have obtained a minimum writing 
linewidth of 50nm and a maximum writing range of 500×500µm2 in our electron-beam 
lithography system. Pitch arrays of 100nm pitch-diameter and 100nm separation have been 
formed on 100×100µm2 semiconductor substrates. The etching depth of patterned GaAs and 
InP substrates are 70 nm and 45 nm, respectively. (2) We have also studied the opto-electric 
properties of InGaAsN single- and double-quantum-well (SQW and DQW) structures by 
Photocurrent, and Electro-absorption spectroscopy. The DQW structure shows an additional 
enhancement in electroabsorption of a maximum Δα ~ 14400 cm-1, which is 2.6 times larger 
than the maximum Δα ~ 5400 cm-1 of the SQW sample. (3) InxGa1-xAs (x=0.5~0.75) QD’s of 
high density of 1.3×1011 cm-2 and uniform size (diameter ~ 23-nm and height ~ 4-nm) were 
obtained by MBE. λ=1.3 μm emission was observed for In0.65Ga0.35As QD’s capped with 
In0.1Ga0.9As. (4) We have investigated the polarization effect of optical process in the 
vertically coupled InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) triple layers by varying the thickness of 
GaAs spacer layer.  The TE/TM ratio for the ground state emission decreases from near 4 to 
1.5 as the spacer thickness decreases from 40 nm to 5 nm.  The TE polarization (in-plane 
polarization) is anisotropic with a stronger component along [011] direction.
