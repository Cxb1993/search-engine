type), III(down-ward type), and IV(mixed type). Various groups can be generated by 
combining these four types. We first induce the basic rules of the four types, then to bind the 
dynamic rules for various groups. Such a rule induction problem is reformulated as an integer 
programming program. The objective function in this program is to maximize the accuracy 
rate of rule, while the constraint is to keep the coverage rate be higher than a threshold value. 
By the way, this study can depict the reasons of causing various types and groups onto spheres. 
It is helpful for the nations to plan their development strategies.

Our research data comes from the Major Competitiveness Indicators (MCI) accredited in 
IMD (International Institute for Management and Development) annual reports of 2001, 2003, 
and 2005 [4, 5, 6]. The MCI datasets cover 14 major competitiveness indicators for 46 nations 
during 2001 to 2005 (Table A.1, A.2, and A.3 of Appendix A). These datasets are the most 
continued, consistent, and reliable data chosen by IMD. The names, description and measure 
units of these 14 indicators are given in Table 1.1.  
In order to induce rules of competitiveness, we need to convert the datasets in Appendix 
A into discrete codes. Each indicator ia  is divided into four levels: very high, high, medium, 
and low according to the value domain of that indicator. The k-mean technique is used to 
divide these four levels described in Appendix D. Following Fusun (2002) we may also divide 
46 nations into 4 classes based on nations’ annual competitiveness scores of 2001, 2003, and 
2005 [7]: highly competitive nations ( 4G ), competitive nations ( 3G ), non-competitive nations 
( 2G ), and least-competitive nations ( 1G ). The IMD datasets in Table A.1, A.2, and A.3 in 
Appendix A are then converted respectively into Table B.1, B.2, and B.3 of Appendix B. Take 
USA at 2001 (in Table A.1) for instance, the 2a  value is 580.5 and the overall score is 100. 
Since such an 2a  value belongs to level 4 and the score value belongs to level 4 (according 
to the standard in Table D), we then denote 42 =a  and score = 4 at Table B.1. 
 By examing the change of a nation’s class for years of 2001, 203, and 2005, we  may 
classify the 46 nations into 4 types and 18 groups shown in Table 1.2 by following ways. 
(i) A nation is in group Gijk, if the nation belongs to i, j, and k class in the year of 2001, 
2003, and 2005 respectively.

2. Purpose 
This study intends to induce the rules of formulating nations’ competitiveness types 
and groups based on 14 critical indicators in IMD. We first induce the rules of formulating 
G4, G3, G2, and G1 for the years of 2001, 2003, and 2005. Then we formulate the rules for 
some Gijk groups. 
The induced rules have following features: 
(i) The rules are expressed in “If …Then” production form [8] with conjunction and/or 
disjunction description. 
(ii) Two evaluations of the quality of a rule are used: the accuracy rate (AR) and the 
coverage rate (CR). A representative rule of a specific group should have high AR and 
CR. Such a rule should be supported by most nations in the same groups and had better 
not cover nations in other groups.  
(iii) The rules are induced by solving some mixed 0-1 linear programming problems. The 
objective is to maximize AR and CR values. Globally optimal solutions are guaranteed to 
find.  
Our study will respond to following typical questions about nations’ competitiveness 
such as: (a) What are the most critical indicators? (b) If a nation (such as USA or 
SINGAPORE) wants to keep at high competitive level, what they need to do? (c) What are 
the essential indicators to care if a nation wants to upgrade from G3 to G4, or G2 to G3?  (d) 
Which indicators restrict the progress of a less competitive nation?

Such an expression is very useful in expressing rules in conjunction and disjunction forms. 
Considering following remarks.  
Remark 1: 
(i) If j is an ignored indicator for )(kRl , then 0=ljpd  for all p     (2.3) 
(ii) If jp is an active sub-attribute for )(kRl , then  1=ljpd    (2.4) 
(iii)There is at most one indicator where the number of its sub-attributes is larger or equal to 2. 
That means there is at most an indicator j where 2≥∑
p
l
jpd     (2.5) 
Situation (i) is for the case when a rule can be expressed compactly by less number of 
indicators. Situation (ii) is for the case where the disjunction expression is used for an 
indicator. Situation (iii) allows disjunction being used at most on one indicator, which is for 
the compactness of rule expression.  
For the small example in Table 2.2, we can list intuitively related classification rules 
expressed in Table 2.3 and 2.4. The mathematical model of inducing these rules is described 
 10
(i) There may have more than one classification rule for a specific group. For instance, both 
R1(1) and R2(1) are used to classify the 1st group. 
(ii) A rule with more supporting nations is better than the rule with less supporting nations. 
For instance, R1(2) is better than R2(2). 
(iii) A rule may be obtained by integrating related rules, thus to have more supporting nations. 
For instance, R3(3) is the union of R1(3) and R2(3), which is supported by more nations 
than R1(3) and R2(3). 
(iv) The rules can be expressed in both conjunction and disjunction form. For instance, R3(3) 
is expressed in disjunction form while R1(1) and R2(1) are in conjunction form. 
Worthy to note that the disjunction can only be used for at most one indicator in our method. 
Some important features about the induction of rules are discussed next. 
Follows are three criteria for evaluating the goodness of a rule. 
(i) The rule of a group should be supported by most nations of the same group. 
(ii) The rule should be accurate. That means a rule of a group had better not cover the nations 
of other groups.  
(iii) The rule should be expressed in a compacter way. That means the less the number of 
indicators used in expressing a rule the better the rule is. 
Consider a data set containing n nations. Denote the number of nations belonging to a specific 
k group as n(k). By referring to (2.3) and (2.4), the meanings of the accuracy rate, the 
supporting rate, and the compactness rate are specified below: 
Accuracy rate: The accuracy rate of a rule )(kARl is specified as

That means if none of nation kgN rr ≠  where  violets the rule, then the accuracy rate of the 
rule is 1.

instance, 20014R  is the best rule for class 4 at year 2001, which is expressed as ( 33 ≥a ) and 
( 4or  4 21 == aa ), AR = 0.87, and CR = 0.86. That means: For a nation at year 2001, if its 
GDP ( 3a ) greater than or equal to level 3, and its Computer ( 2a ) or its Export ( 3a ) is at 
highest level (level 4), then this nation belongs to the highest class (G4). Fifteen of forty six 
nations fit these conditions (13 in G4 and other two are BELGIUM, NORWAY). Therefore the 
accuracy rate is 29/31=0.93. The rule covers 13 of 15 nations in G4 (GERMANY, and 
AUSTRIA are not covered), the coverage rate is 13/15=0.86.

(iv) Inflation ( 8a ) is important for the competitive and non-competitive nations. If a nation 
does not want to be least competitive, it should prevent its inflation level from less than 
2. 
(v) Stock ( 5a ) can reflect the business ability and nations’ competitiveness from the view of 
globalization. Foreign capital investment gives rises of international collaboration and 
globalization. A competitive nation had better to keep its stock market capitalization 
level higher or equal to three (i.e., 35 =a ).   
(vi) Investment inward carries capital and technology to help nations promote their 
competitiveness. The a10=2 or  a1=2 signifies a non-competitive nation. From an 
improvement view, a least competitive nation wants to move up to a more competitive 
position; it needs to enhance its investment inward or export to level 2.  
(vii) All 20011R ,

owing to its lower GDP ( 23 ≤a ) or lowest Computer ( 12 =a ) may also cause the least 
competitiveness.

indicators that is the Inflation (a8) becomes more significant than investment inward  in 
the recent years. 
The above analysis is summarized in Figure 3.2.

4. Dynamic rules of various competitiveness groups 
By referring to the rules of forming four classes in Table 3.1, here we induce some of 
the dynamic rules of forming 18 various competitive groups listed in Table 1.2. There are four 
types of changed patterns: un-change type, up-ward type, down-ward type, and mixed type. 
Take 444R  for instance, 444R  is the rule of forming the 4G  class in all 2001, 2003, and 
2005, which is expressed as  
444R = )4()4()4(

            =( 33 ≥a ) ∧ ( 44 21 =∨= aa ) 
twelve nations are covered by this rule, where AR=0.94 and CR=1. Similarly,  
333R = )3()3()3(

Four rules for unchanged type are illustrated in Table 4.1. 
The rule for groups of the up-ward type are illustrated in Figure 4.1 and described in 
Table 4.2 Only three nations are included in this type, where Taiwan belongs to G334, Thailand 
belongs to G122, and India belongs to G112. Taiwan’s being upgraded from G3 to G4 seems 
difficult to explain by these 14 indicators. Examining Table 4.2 can also find the critical 
indicators of upgrading Thailand and India from less-competitive class to non-competitive

(viii) The last step takes induced rules of 2002, 2005, and 2008 to imply how a nation sustains, 
progresses or falls down between clusters. 
 
This study proposes a method of displaying clusters and nations around cluster centers, which 
is described in this section. It applies techniques of multiple dimensional scaling and integer 
programming to approach minimum error rate of transforming high dimensional data to low 
dimensions. Before the displaying model, we have two functions, normalization and dissimilarity, for 
adjustment of measure over years and pair-distance between any two nations, which described in 
section 5.1 and 5.2. Then, we design two optimization models of solving clusters’ strength and 
locating members of each cluster.  
 
5.1 Normalized Function 
An adjustment of measures over years is made by the normalized function (5.1.a):

business efficiency, and infrastructure, respectively; kw  is 0.25 for each factor due to same weight

5.2 Dissimilarity Function 
Finding a configuration such that the distance, ijd , in high dimensions matches as well as the distance, 
ijdˆ , in low dimensions is the goal of MDS. The dij (dissimilarity) is measured as the Euclidean 
distance between nations i and j, which is formulated by the function (5.2.a) as

Here, stress error rate of each cluster is required less than 15%. Users can adjust an expanding

to keep better productivity. Then the nation needs to have high degree of technology 
infrastructure or stock market value; reflected as Computer ≥ 3 or Stock ≥ 3.  
(iii) Improve growth G1 to G2 
The nation requires to upgrade its export or to control its inflation higher than or equal to 
a medium level; reflected as Export ≥ 2 or Inflation ≥ 2. INDIA is an example of 
competitiveness progress with maintaining inflation at medium level, when inflation 
becomes more important at 2005. 
(iv) Down ward from G4 to G3 
Degenerate employment and GDP growth are major indicators to depress the 
competitiveness. AUSTRIA and GERMANY suffered from social instability and impeded 
GDP growth. 
(v)  Down ward from G3 to G2 
Degenerate employment, GDP growth, and worsen account balance causes the 
competitive nations lose power and go down to lower positions. FRANCE and SPAIN 
have same problem with unemployment and GDP growth. SPAIN depressed much more 
because of dramatic increase of negative account balance. Even obtaining great 
investment inward its unemployment and GDP growth have not improved.  
(v)  Down ward from G2 to G1 
Social instability exerts strong influence on down ward of competitiveness for less 
competitive nations. Worsen Inflation and unemployment happens in BRAZIL, GREECE, and 
MEXICO. GREECE faces much more tough situation same as SPAIN. How to make efficient 
on inward investment and improve social stability is an urgent issue.

(b) Calculating similarity distance of nation i to center of group k, d(i, k), for all nations where k = 4, 3, 2, 
1 
(c) Comparing d(i, 4), d(i, 3), d(i, 2), d(i, 1) and check the smallest d(i, k) where k is the group index that 
nation i will belong to. If nation i already belongs to k, then do nothing. Otherwise, move nation i to 
another group, chenage the Pk to the number of natinons that class level k has, and repeat step (a) ~ 
(c). 
(d) If comparisons of Manhattan distance of all nations have no change, then stops execution. 
The classified nations during 2001, 2003, and 2005 are presented in Table C.  
  44
Each indicator ai is divided into four levels with three cutting points P1, P2, and P3. ai belongs to 
1th, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th level respectively i ai ≤ P1, P1≤ ai ≤P2, P2≤ ai ≤ P3, and P3≤ ai. The values of P1, P2, 
and P3 are determined by the crition that the number of nations in each level is almost the same. Take a1 
for instance, by specifying P1=1645, P2=6537, and P3=13024, the number of nations at 1th, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 
is 12, 12, 11, and 11. The values of each indicator with respect to nations are listed in Table D.
