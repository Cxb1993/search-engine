the λ max of disazo dyes in all solvents does not change 
significantly. As shown in Fig.1, the absorption spectra of the 
dye IIIa in all solvents shifted bathochromically with respect to 
the absorption spectra in acetone (e.g. for dye IIIa λ max is 
511nm in DMSO, 506nm in DMF, and 499nm in acetone ). The 
similar effects of absorption shifts in all solvents were also 
found for the entire series of the other symmetrical disazo dyes 
III and asymmetrical disazo dyes IV, V and VI. It was 
observed in Table 2 that the disazo dyes IIIa, IIIb, IVa and Va. 
It is shown the absorption maxima in the range of 499 to 514 
nm in acetone. The symmetrical disazo dye IIIa, possessing a 
thiazole residue in the 3, 6-position of pyrazolo[1,5-a] 
pyrimidine ring, adsorbs at shorter wavelengths in acetone than 
the disazo dyes IIIb, IVa and Va, bearing a benzothiazoyl 
moiety in the 3 or 6-position of pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine ring 
in (Fig.2). Replacement of a thiazolyl residue in dye IIIa by 
benzothiazolyl residue at 6- or 3-position of heterocyclic 
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine ring, as in dyes IVa or Va results in 
a displacement of the absorption maxima at 512 nm or 509 nm 
in acetone, so that the ∆λ max value of IVa and Va show 
bathochromic shift of +13 nm and +10 nm relative to dye IIIa 
due to the fact that the benzothiazole moiety posseses more 
electron density than that of thiazole moiety, respectively.

and the ∆λ max value of dyes Vc is  + 11 nm wavelengths 
longer than dye Va in the same solvent, respectively. 
Additionally, the λ max of IVa-IVc show slight spectral shifts of 
3 to 1 nm in acetone relative to dyes Va-Vc, as shown in Table 3. 
It could be concluded that the introduction of a electron donating 
group (methyl or methoxy) on the 6-position of unsubstituted 
benzothiazole residue in the 3- or 6-position of the 
pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine ring results only in a little 
bathochromic shift in acetone. It is also observed that the λ max 
of dyes IV and V do not change significantly in polar aprotic 
solvents  DMSO and DMF, as shown in Table 1. The effect of 
substituents in the disazo dyes VI compared to the disazo dye 
IIIb-IIId in acetone was also evaluated. It was observed (Table 
4) that the introduction of electron donating group (methyl or 
methoxy) into the dye IIIb at the 6-position of benzothiazolyl 
group on the 3- or 6-position of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 
ring resulted in a bathochromic shifts in acetone.( e.g. for  dye 
VIa ∆λ max = +11 nm, for VIb ∆λ max = +16 nm , for dye VIc 
∆λ max = +10 nm, and for dye VIe ∆λ max = +18 nm relative to 
dye IIIb, respectively). Interestingly, it was observed that the 
absorption spectra of some disazo dyes VI result in a different 
spectral shifts compared to the dye IIIc. The disazo dyes VIa 
and VIc caused exhibit a hypsochromic shifts of -10 nm and -9 
nm, relative to the dye IIIc, whereas dyes VId and VIf exhibit a 
bathochromic shift of +1 nm and +6 nm relative to the dye IIIc, 
respectively. It was also observed that the absorption maxima of 
the some disazo dyes VI shifted hypsochromically with respect 
to the dye IIId. (e.g. for dye VIe ∆λ max = -20 nm, for dye VIf 
∆λ max = -2 nm, for dye VIb ∆λ max = -12 nm and for dye VId 
∆λ max = -7 nm relative to IIId, respectively).
