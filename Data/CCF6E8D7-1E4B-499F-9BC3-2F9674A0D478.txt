recognized results. Although many efficient 
signal filters for noise reduction have been 
developed in recent years, little research 
devoted to this study. In practical 
applications, how to choose an adequate filter 
to do the noise reduction for the various 
noise types on twister is a difficult work. It is 
necessary to choose an adequate signal filter 
for the processing of the various noise types 
existed in yarn tension signal. To find an 
adequate filter, four efficient low-pass filters 
(LPF) including Butterworth LPF (BLPF), 
Gaussian LPF (GLPF), Smoothing LPF 
(SLPF), and Wavelet LPF (WLPF) are 
applied to compare the performance of noise 
reduction on various abnormal tension 
patterns. BLPF2,3 is a suitable choice in cases 
where tight control of the transition between 
low and high frequency. Different from that, 
GLPF4 allows much more high frequency 
signal to pass through. SLPF5 takes the 
average of the signal data contained in the 
moving window. Wavelet transform6-9 can 
efficiently extract both time and frequency 
information from a time-varying signal. 
WLPF10 is a filter which bases upon the 
Wavelet transform. In this paper, we focus on 
the comparison and analysis of various 
low-pass filters for reducing noise on yarn 
tension signal. The signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) and computation time are used to 
evaluate the performance of various filters in 
experiments. 
4. THEORIES OF THE LOW-PASS 
FILTERS 
Butterworth Low-pass Filter (BLPF) 
In BLPF, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is 
applied to transform the tension signal from 
time-domain to frequency-domain. Let  
( : time index) be the tension signal in 
time-domain, and  ( : frequency 
index) be the tension signal in 
frequency-domain. The transfer function 
 of the BLPF of order  is expressed 
as

)(uH n

where  denotes the cutoff frequency. The 
cutoff frequency can be designed by a certain 
theoretical criterion.11 In Figure 1, BLPF 
( =n  D 20 ~ 5 =) with different ( ) is 
shown. The basic model for filtering is 
defined as 
)( )(  )( ˆ uHuXuX =  (2) 
where is the de-noised signal in 
frequency-domain. By inverse Fourier 
transform, the tension signal with noise 
reduction can be obtained. 
)(ˆ uX  
Gaussian Low-pass Filter (GLPF) 
Different from the BLPF, the transfer 
function of GLPF4 is expressed as 
) 2  exp()( 22 quuH −=  (3) 
where  is the standard deviation of the 
Gaussian curve. GLPF provides spectral 
attenuation by tuning parameter q. Large 
value  can retain more components of low 
frequency tension signal. Figure 2 shows the 
GLPF with different standard deviations 
(

scale. The analysis and synthesis of the 
wavelet transform are shown in Figure 5 and

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND 
DISCUSSION 
In the experiments, a personal computer with 
an Intel Pentium III / 1G Hz CPU is used to 
implement noise reduction. The tension and 
noise were collected from different twist yarn 
factory by a QAI yarn quality control system 
which was developed by YU HWA Co., Ltd. 
The sampling time of yarn tension signal 
acquisition is 0.01 sec. The tension sensors 
are frictional contact type as shown in Figure 
7, which are installed on the twister. In 
Figure 8, four representative abnormal yarn 
tension patterns (“knot transfer”, “splice 
transfer”, “foreign matter” and “tail transfer”) 
are selected to test low-pass filters. It is 
assumed that the common noises include 
electronic noise, vibration disturbance, and 
mass variation. To demonstrate the features 
of the tension signal in the time-domain and 
frequency-domain, the tension pattern “tail 
transfer” with various noises is shown in 
Figure 9. Form the Figure 9(e), we find that 
the major part of frequency components 
concentrate on the lower band 
( ). As the signal is mixed with 
three type noises (Figures 9(f) ~ 9(h)), they 
arise the different effect in the frequency 
response. The frequency components of 
electronic noise are averagely distributed on 
5050 <<− u
higher band ( 50>u  and , Figure 
9(f)), the frequency components of mass 
variation are distributed on the lower band 
(
50−<u
4747 <<− u , Figure 9(g)), and the 
frequency components of vibration 
disturbance are distributed on the higher 
band (  and 220>u 220−<u , Figure 9(h)). 
In the experiments, the SNR and the 
computation time are used to evaluate the 
performances of all filters. The tension signal 
with noise ( ) is assumed a linear mixture 
of the pure tension signal ( ) and the 
noise ( ). The SNR is defined as

The numerator of Eq. (10) means the 
amplitude of the pure tension signal ( ), 
and the denominator of Eq. (10) means the 
difference between the pure tension signal 
( ) and the de-noised signal ( ). It 
means that the large SNR value, the better 
performance of noise reduction is. The 
computation time is used to evaluate the 
possibility of system realization for real 
application.

Figures 10 ~ 12 demonstrate the noise 
reduction by four low-pass filters. The SNR 
and computation time of all experiments are 
shown in Table I ~ IV. The frequency 
components of the electronic noise and 
vibration disturbance are distributed on the 
high band, and they can be easily reduced by 
four low-pass filters. These low-pass filters 
have good performance on high frequency 
components reducing. The mass variation 
occurs in the yarn spinning process while 
polymer material quality is unstable. Since 
the frequency components of mass variation 
distribute on the same band of the major
