Abstract 
The objective of this project is to develop 
three-dimensional dynamic flow solvers on 
unstructured meshes to study turbulent flows 
over vibrating blades with interblade phase 
angles and blade tip clearances.  To reduce the 
computational time tremendously, the 
single-blade approach with the phase-shifted 
periodic boundary treatment for arbitrary 
interblade phase angles will be implemented to 
confine the computational domain to be 
one-blade only, instead of using multiple-blades 
approach with the simple spatially periodic 
boundary treatment.  The present 3-D dynamic 
flow solvers incorporate the locally implicit 
finite volume scheme, dynamic mesh algorithm, 
phase-shifted periodic boundary treatment and 
anisotropic dissipation model on unstructured 
tetrahedral meshes. The three-dimensional, 
unsteady Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes 
equations with moving domain effects and a 
two-equation low-Reynolds-number k-ε 
turbulence model are solved in the Cartesian 
coordinate system.  To accurately calculate 
fluxes across moving cell surfaces, a 3-D 
geometric conservation law has to be satisfied in 
addition to mass, momentum and energy 
conservation laws. 
The first physical problem is the turbulent 
flow around an ONERA M6 wing, while the 
second physical problem is transonic flow 
around a transport RAE wing-fuselage 
configuration.  After comparing the calculated 
pressure coefficient distributions at different 
spanwise cross sections with those of 
experimental results, the accuracy of the present 
3-D dynamic flow solvers on static unstructured 
is confirmed.  Then, the dynamic solvers are 
applied to simulate 3-D turbulent flows over 
vibrating blades with interblade phase angles and 
blade tip clearences. After completing this 
project, the computational capability and 
knowledge of three-dimensional dynamic 
turbulent flow calculations on unstructured 
meshes are promoted.  The results of this

all-airfoils-oscillating data. 
Unstructured meshes have been a major 
concern in the development of computational fluid 
dynamics.  As mentioned by Sheng et al. [20], the 
biggest advantage of the unstructured grid 
approach over the structured grid approach is that 
the process of grid generation for complex 
geometries is greatly simplified.  Also mentioned 
by Mavriplis [21], unstructured grid techniques 
offered the potential for greatly reducing the grid 
generation time associated with complex 
geometries.  Furthermore, unstructured mesh 
approaches enabled the use of adaptive meshing 
techniques, which held great promise for 
increasing solution accuracy at minimal additional 
computational cost.  Recently, considerable effort 
has been made to develop solution techniques 
[20-38] for solving the Euler/Navier-Stokes 
equations on unstructured meshes.  A novel 
strategy [22], which included the elements of the 
no cavity and nonoverlapping conditions and a 
mesh generation technique, was presented to 
create tetrahedral meshes.  An object-oriented 
approach [23] was presented for automatic 
parallel advancing front based surface mesh 
generation and adaptive remeshing for complex 
configurations, whereas a simple embedded 
domain method for node-based unstructured grid 
solver [24] was presented with mesh refinement 
based on proximity to the embedded surfaces.  
An unstructured dynamic mesh adaptation and 
load balancing algorithm [25] had been 
developed for the efficient simulation of 
three-dimensional unsteady inviscid flows on 
parallel machines. The resolution of 
time-dependent solutions was enhanced by 
adopting an h-refinement/coarsening algorithm.  
A three-dimensional unstructured dynamic mesh 
method [26] for viscous flow computation was 
presented to simulate aircraft performance when 
control surface deflection was changed. The 
unstructured hybrid meshes comprised of 
tetrahedral, prisms and pyramids.  Farhat et al. 
[27] presented a dynamic version of the 
variational multiscale method for large eddy 
simulation on unstructured meshes of turbulent 
compressible flows, where two variational 
analogues of Germano’s algebraic identity and a 
computationally efficient agglomeration-based 
numerical procedure were included as key 
features.  Based on a finite volume/finite 
element discretization of the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids 
and a Roe second-order scheme with MUSCL 
extrapolation [28], large-eddy simulations had 
been performed of a compressed vortex flow 
undergoing transition to turbulence. 
An implicit multigrid-driven algorithm [29] 
for two-dimensional incompressible laminar 
flows had been coupled with a solution 
adaptation method and a mesh movement 
method for boundary movement.  Time 
dependent calculations were performed 
implicitly by regarding each time step as a steady 
state problem in pseudo-time.  Large eddy 
simulations [30] were performed to reproduce 
the generation and breakdown of a tumbling 
motion in the simplified model engine, where a 
second order accurate numerical scheme was 
applied in conjunction with a fixed finite 
volume/finite element formulation adapted for 
unstructured deforming meshes.  Acharya et al. 
[31] reviewed the basics of the finite volume 
method and traced its extension to unstructured 
meshes through the use of cell-based and control 
volume finite element schemes. The 
development of staggered mesh schemes and 
segregated solution techniques such as the 
SIMPLE algorithm were also reviewed.  An 
adaptive mesh moving technique [32] was 
presented for three dimensional fluid flow 
problems that involved moving fluid boundaries 
and fluid-solid interfaces. Such mesh moving 
techniques are an essential ingredient of 
fluid-structure interaction methods that typically 
employed arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian 
frameworks.  The approximation power of 
moving least squares [33] in the context of 
higher order finite volume schemes on 
unstructured grids was explored. It allowed the 
direction reconstruction of high order viscous 
fluxes using quite compact stencils and without 
introducing new degrees of freedom.  High 
order essentially non-oscillatory schemes [34] 
were applied to high speed flows on unstructured 
meshes. The entire reconstruction process was 
described with emphasis on the stencil selection 
algorithms.  A Newton-Krylov algorithm [35] 
was presented for the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions on 
unstructured grid. The algorithm used a 
preconditioned matrix-free Krylov method to 
 6
  
Vi, n, and Di represent the cell volume, marching 
time step and artificial dissipation operator 
respectively. In this paper, θ=1 and β=1/2 are 
adopted for flow calculations and the scheme 
becomes second-order accurate in time. 
On the structured grid system, Jameson et al. 
[39] had developed an effective form for Di. The 
isotropic value for scaling the dissipation was 
extended to unstructured triangular meshes by 
Mavriplis [40].  On the static triangular mesh, 
Hwang and Liu [41] developed the anisotropic 
dissipation model.  In the previous study [42], 
the anisotropic dissipation model was developed 
on the dynamic quadrilateral-triangular mesh for 
2-D turbulent flow calculations.  In this project, 
the 3-D anisotropic dissipation model on 
unstructured tetrahedrons is developed.  The 
mathematical form is described as follows.

To solve Equation (6), a locally implicit 
scheme [43-45] is implemented.  This scheme is 
locally implicit, but globally explicit and is 
unconditionally stable under local linearized 
analysis.  It does not require the assembly of 
any global matrices and does not need any matrix 
system solvers. The locally implicit scheme was 
developed on structured quadrilaterals originally.  
In this project principal investigator’s previous 
study [42], the 2-D locally implicit scheme and 
2-D anisotropic dissipation model were 
developed on the quadrilateral-triangular mesh 
for turbulent flow calculations.  In this project, 
the 3-D locally implicit scheme and 3-D 
anisotropic dissipation model are developed on 
unstructured tetrahedral meshes. For each 
tetrahedral cell i, the equation for iterative 
corrections is written as

where CFL is the Courant–Friedrichs-Lewy 
number. ΔU shown on the right hand side of 
Equation (7) takes the latest available values 
from Equation (8).  The inner iteration 
forΔU(m+1) can be computed rapidly since the dU 
corrections are explicit scalar equations.  One 
symmetric cycle of inner iterations is employed 
in each time step for steady flow calculations, 
whereas several cycles are performed until a 
convergence state of ( )1+Δ miU  is reached for 
unsteady flow calculations. At the end of a time 
step, the outer relaxation is introduced.

comparing the calculated pressure coefficient 
distributions at selected spanwise cross sections 
shown in Figures 2(a)-(c) with those of 
experimental [46] results, the satisfactory 
agreement between the present and experimental 
data is achieved.  The accuracy of the present 
3-D flow solver on unstructured tetrahedral 
meshes is confirmed again.  As shown in 
Figures 2(a)-(b), both of the former and latter 
shocks are depicted on the upper surface of each 
selected spanwise cross section. The former 
shock grows backward and latter shock migrates 
forward as the spanwise location moves from the 
wing root toward tip direction.  As far as the 
triple shock wave structure is concerned, the 
former and latter shocks observed in Figures 
2(a)-(b) merge together to form a stronger shock 
in Figure 2(c) as the spanwise location 
approaches the wingtip.  Hence, the capability 
of shock capturing at selected wing spanwise 
cross sections is demonstrated in Figures 2(a)-(c).  
The triple shock wave structure is also depicted 
on the upper wing surface.  
To further assess the accuracy of the present 
3-D flow solver on unstructured tetrahedrons, the 
transonic flow around the RAE wing-body is 
investigated.  Regarding the computational 
domain, the wing-body with a leading edge 
sweep of 36.65 degrees and a trailing edge sweep 
of 22.34 degrees is enclosed by a symmetric 
plane and several far-field planes which are at 
least 15 times the length of fuselage away from 
the wing root.  The RAE wing-body [47] is the 
research wing ‘A’ in combination with an 
axis-symmetric body.  Moreover, the wing A is 
without dihedral or twist and is based on an 
uncambered RAE 101 airfoil section.  The 
aspect and taper ratios of the RAE wing-body are 
set to be 6 and 1/3, respectively.  Its wingtip is 
rounded according to experimental configuration 
[47] and the corresponding airfoil cross section is 
symmetric.  The free stream Mach number and 
angle of attack are set to be 0.8 and 0o, 
respectively.  The global and local views of 
unstructured tetrahedral mesh for the transonic 
flow around the RAE wing-body are plotted in 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively, where 
approximately one million computational cells 
are generated. After comparing the calculated 
pressure coefficient distributions at selected wing 
spanwise cross sections shown in Figures 4(a)-(c) 
with those of experimental [47] results, the 
satisfactory agreement between the present and 
experimental data is demonstrated.  The 
accuracy of the present 3-D flow solver on 
unstructured tetrahedral meshes is confirmed 
again.  As shown in Figures 4(a)-(c), the value 
of wing surface pressure coefficient reaches its 
maximum at the leading edge, where the value of 
velocity reaches its minimum due to symmetric 
wing cross section and zero angle of attack.  
The value of pressure coefficient decreases from 
the leading edge and reaches its minimum at the 
position of approximately 30% of chord (Figures 
4(a)-(c)), which is due to the effect of airfoil 
thickness.  Afterward, it increases as the 
corresponding airfoil position approaches the 
trailing edge. 
To reduce the computational effort 
tremendously, the single-blade approach with the 
phase-shifted periodic boundary condition 
treatment for arbitrary interblade phase angles 
will be implemented to confine the 
computational domain to be one-blade only, 
instead of using multiple-blades approach with 
the simple spatially periodic boundary condition 
treatment.  The computational domain contains 
one-blade only, where the values of inlet Mach 
number, aspect ratio, thickness-to-chord ratio 
and interblade phase angle are 0.8, 1.0, 0.12, and 
90 deg, respectively.  The corresponding 
unstructured mesh for turbulent flow around an 
vibrating blade is plotted in Figure 5, where 
more than one million computational cells are 
generated.  The motion of the vibrating blade, 
which is executing bending mode oscillation. 
The bending direction is normal to the absolute 
chord, whereas the bending amplitudes are set to 
be 1.2, 2.4, 3.6 and 4.8 degrees, respectively.  
According to the distributions of the calculated 
amplitude of the first harmonic pressure 
coefficient of vibrating blade,  Its value reaches 
maximum in the leading edge region and 
decreases as it approaches from the leading edge 
to the trailing edge.  As far as the acoustic wave 
structure is concerned, the dilatation (Δ= Vr•∇ ) 
is equal to zero at the peak or valley of acoustic 
wave.  The absolute value of gradient of 
dilatation is  introduced as an indicator to 
capture acoustic waves.  The tip-leakage is 
recognized as an important source of loss and 
believed to be closely related to the onset of

The unstructured hybrid meshes comprised of tetrahedral, prisms and pyramids.  Farhat et al. 
[8] presented a dynamic version of the variational multiscale method for large eddy 
simulation on unstructured meshes of turbulent compressible flows, where two variational 
analogues of Germano’s algebraic identity and a computationally efficient 
agglomeration-based numerical procedure were included as key features.  Based on a finite 
volume/finite element discretization of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on 
unstructured grids and a Roe second-order scheme with MUSCL extrapolation [9], large-eddy 
simulations had been performed of a compressed vortex flow undergoing transition to 
turbulence. 
An implicit multigrid-driven algorithm [10] for two-dimensional incompressible laminar 
flows had been coupled with a solution adaptation method and a mesh movement method for 
boundary movement.  Time dependent calculations were performed implicitly by regarding 
each time step as a steady state problem in pseudo-time.  Large eddy simulations [11] were 
performed to reproduce the generation and breakdown of a tumbling motion in the simplified 
model engine, where a second order accurate numerical scheme was applied in conjunction 
with a fixed finite volume/finite element formulation adapted for unstructured deforming 
meshes.  Acharya et al. [12] reviewed the basics of the finite volume method and traced its 
extension to unstructured meshes through the use of cell-based and control volume finite 
element schemes. The development of staggered mesh schemes and segregated solution 
techniques such as the SIMPLE algorithm were also reviewed.  An adaptive mesh moving 
technique [13] was presented for three dimensional fluid flow problems that involved moving 
fluid boundaries and fluid-solid interfaces. Such mesh moving techniques are an essential 
ingredient of fluid-structure interaction methods that typically employed arbitrary 
Lagrangian-Eulerian frameworks.  The approximation power of moving least squares [14] in 
the context of higher order finite volume schemes on unstructured grids was explored. It 
allowed the direction reconstruction of high order viscous fluxes using quite compact stencils 
and without introducing new degrees of freedom.  High order essentially non-oscillatory 
schemes [15] were applied to high speed flows on unstructured meshes. The entire 
reconstruction process was described with emphasis on the stencil selection algorithms.  A 
Newton-Krylov algorithm [16] was presented for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in 
three dimensions on unstructured grid. The algorithm used a preconditioned matrix-free 
Krylov method to solve the linear system that arose in the Newton iterations.  Maire and 
Breil [17] presented a new second-order cell-centered scheme to simulate compressible fluid 
flows. It was developed on general unstructured meshes consisting of arbitrary polygons.  
The accuracy of drag prediction in unstructured mesh CFD solver of TAS code was discussed 
using a drag decomposition method [18]. It decomposed total drag into wave, profile, induced 
and spurious drag components. The accuracy of drag prediction is increased by eliminating 
the spurious drag component from the total drag.                
  As for the dissipation model, Jameson et al. [19] had developed an effective form on the 
structured grid system. The isotropic value for scaling the dissipation was extended to 
unstructured triangular meshes by Mavriplis [20].  On the triangular mesh, Hwang and Liu 
[21] developed the anisotropic dissipation model.  In the author’s previous study [22], the 
anisotropic dissipation model was developed on the quadrilateral-triangular mesh for 2-D 
turbulent flow calculations.  In this paper, the 3-D anisotropic dissipation model on 
unstructured tetrahedrons is developed.  The present scheme is locally implicit, but globally 
explicit and is unconditionally stable under local linearized analysis [23].  It does not require 
the assembly of any global matrices and does not need any matrix system solvers. The locally 
implicit scheme was developed on structured quadrilaterals originally [24].  In the author’s

A fully implicit finite-volume discretization scheme is applied to Equation (3) over the 
entire flowfield.  Flow variables at cell faces are obtained from the averages of flow 
variables at the cell centers.  Those values and artificial dissipation terms are introduced for 
surface integral and numerical stability.  By implementing a two-parameter family (θ,β) on 
the dynamic unstructured tetrahedrons or hexahedrons, Equation (3) can be written as

Vi, n, and Di represent the cell volume, marching time step and artificial dissipation 
operator respectively. In this paper, θ=1 and β=0 are selected for steady flow calculations and 
the scheme becomes first-order accurate in time, whereas θ=1 and β=1/2 are adopted for 
unsteady flow calculations and the scheme becomes second-order accurate in time. The fourth 
and fifth terms on the right-hand side of Equation (4) account for the effects of volume 
variation as meshes deform during time evolution. Under rigid-body motions or mesh-fixed 
situations, these two terms will vanish.   
On the structured grid system, Jameson et al. [19] developed an effective form for Di. 
The isotropic value for scaling the dissipation has been extended to unstructured triangular 
meshes by Mavriplis [20].  On the static triangular mesh, Hwang and Liu [21] developed the 
anisotropic dissipation model.  In the author’s previous study [22], the anisotropic 
dissipation model was developed on the dynamic quadrilateral-triangular mesh for 2-D 
turbulent flow calculations.  In this paper, the 3-D anisotropic dissipation model on both 
dynamic unstructured tetrahedrons and hexahedrons are developed.  The mathematical form 
is described as follows.

The last term on the right-hand side of Equation (6) arises from the dynamic mesh effects 
during linearization. To solve Equation (6), a locally implicit scheme [22-24] is implemented.  
This scheme is locally implicit, but globally explicit and is unconditionally stable under local 
linearized analysis [23].  It does not require the assembly of any global matrices and does 
not need any matrix system solvers. The locally implicit scheme was developed on structured 
quadrilaterals originally [24].  In the author’s previous study [22], the 2-D locally implicit 
scheme and 2-D anisotropic dissipation model were developed on the dynamic 
quadrilateral-triangular mesh for turbulent flow calculations.  In this paper, the 3-D locally 
implicit scheme and 3-D anisotropic dissipation model are developed on both unstructured 
tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. For each tetrahedral or hexahedral cell i, the equation for 
iterative corrections is written as

where CFL is the Courant–Friedrichs-Lewy number. ΔU shown on the right hand side 
of Equation (7) takes the latest available values from Equation (8).  The inner iteration forΔ
U(m+1) can be computed rapidly since the dU corrections are explicit scalar equations.  One 
symmetric cycle of inner iterations is employed in each time step for steady flow calculations, 
whereas several cycles are performed until a convergence state of ( )1+Δ miU  is reached for 
unsteady flow calculations. At the end of a time step, the outer relaxation is introduced.

of the present flow solver on unstructured tetrahedrons, the transonic, turbulent flow around 
an ONERA M6 wing is investigated.  The unstructured tetrahedrons are generated using a 
3-D unstructured mesh generation strategy, where the no-cavity and nonoverlapping 
conditions are imposed.  After comparing the calculated pressure coefficient distributions at 
different spanwise cross sections with those of related numerical and experimental results, the 
accuracy of the present 3-D flow solver on unstructured tetrahedral mesh is confirmed.  The 
capability of shock capturing at different wing spanwise cross sections is demonstrated.  The 
triple shock wave structure is also depicted on the upper wing surface
