2. Background of e-Diagnostics and e-Maintenance 
 
Recently, International SEMATECH (ISMT) has proposed e-diagnostics guidelines 
(e-DIAGNOSTICS and EEC Workshop, 2003) and guidebooks (e-Diagnostics Guidebook, 2002) 
with respect to the functional requirements of e-diagnostics. Additionally, International 
SEMATECH and Japan Electronics and Information Technology Association (JEITA) have 
started their joint research on developing the architecture of Equipment Engineering System (EES) 
for e-manufacturing. E-diagnostics plays an essential role in e-manufacturing to support the 
remote monitoring and diagnostics for equipment suppliers. Furthermore, e-diagnostics can 
provide the functions of data collection and fault analysis as the basis of e-maintenance to 
achieve the capabilities of self-diagnosis, predictive maintenance and automated notification. 
International SEMATECH categorizes the capabilities of e-diagnostics and predictive 
maintenance into four levels (International SEMATECH, 2001): Level 0-access and remote 
collaboration, Level 1-connect and control, Level 2- automated analysis, and Level 3-prediction. 
In Level 3, e-diagnostics/maintenance can identify the negative trend of equipment health as well 
as notify the message to equipment engineers to perform related equipment maintenance and 
repair operations without delay.  
There exist some remote diagnostics systems developed for various industries such as 
semiconductor manufacturing (Hung et al., 2003; Hung et al., 2005; Locy 2001; Inaba et al. 
2001), microscope industry (Caldwell et al. 1998), cement industry (Errath and Dominguez, 
1999), machine fault diagnoses (Fong and Hui, 2001), etc. By using e-diagnostics and 
e-maintenance, the equipment breakdown can be substantially shrunk, and expectedly zero 
downtime be achieved (IMS, 2004). Additionally, the smart and effective maintenance can be 
realized by incorporating with intelligent agents and e-business applications such as Supply 
Chain Management (SCM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM), etc (Koç et al., 2003). The remote equipment evaluation in real time needs 
to integrate a variety of technologies involving device sensors, intelligent agents, communication, 
web-enabled monitoring, prognostics and diagnostics, e-business integration tools and 
self-maintenance. Koç et al. (2003) proposed an e-maintenance platform in which Watchdog 
Agent is the kernel for degradation prediction. 
The existing remote diagnostics systems have four primary drawbacks: using dedicated 
ISDN or telephone connections, applying proprietary information integration, providing limited 
functions of downloading equipment data for analysis, and manually browsing and integrating 
data from websites (Hung et al., 2003; Hung et al., 2005). To improve the existing systems, Hung 
et al. (2005) proposed a Web Services based e-Diagnostics Framework (WSDF), which can 
integrate various heterogeneous data and systems on Intranet and Internet.

Step 5. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items for Sales Forecast 
Step 6. Create Order Forecast 
Step 7. Identify Exceptions for Order Forecast 
Step 8. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items for Order Forecast 
Step 9. Generate Order 
 
The nine steps are illustrated as below: 
Step 1. Create Front-End Agreement:  The retailer and the manufacturer agree upon 
implementation principles and related stipulation to establish a collaborative relationship, and 
thus enter into a Collaboration Agreement.  The contents of the agreement include the mutual 
pre-determined goals, the capability, human resources, and system deployment required to 
achieve the goals, the shared information, and confidentiality clauses.  The future collaborative 
relationship between the two parties is developed on the basis of Collaboration Agreement. 
Step 2. Create Joint Business Plan:  The two parties agree upon replenishment strategies, 
communicate managing strategies and operational plan, share operational goals and strategies at 
various stages, and jointly develop partnership strategies and cooperation plan.  The joint 
business plan built upon shared information can improve the quality of forecasting, and 
strengthen the communication and coordination between collaborative partners along the supply 
chain. 
Step 3. Create Sales Forecast:  At this step, shared demand information is used to support sales 
forecast.  Sales forecast is usually first created by either the retailer or the manufacturer, and 
then communicated to the other party.  After coordination, the resulting sales forecast becomes 
the common guidance for mutual subsequent order forecasting.  Sales forecast reflects a great 
deal of related information of the two parties, for example, joint business plan, promotion activity 
agenda, information of sales locations, and promotion performance etc. 
Step 4. Identify Exceptions for Sales Forecast:  This step focuses on identifying the products 
that do not satisfy the criteria in sales forecast.  These criteria are determined by comparing 
order forecast and supply capacity, from which, a list of exceptions is derived.  Exceptions for 
sales forecast can be identified through determined mutual sales conditions, for example, retail 
inventory and sales forecast accuracy.  
Step 5. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items for Sales Forecast:    This step involves 
resolving sales forecast exceptions by querying shared data, email, telephone conversations, 
meetings, and so on and submitting any resulting changes to the sales forecast.  The increased 
real-time collaboration enabled by CPFR fosters effective joint decision making between the 
retailer/distributor and the manufacturer and increases confidence in the eventual committed 
order. 
Step 6. Create Order Forecast: This step integrates the sales forecast, promotion performance 
information, inventory strategy, historical data of shipment, and current production capacity 
constraints obtained from Step 3 and generates order forecast to support demand forecast for sales 
and the joint business plan created at Step 2.  The short-term use of order forecast is to generate

4. Development of WS-CPFR 
 
4.1 Foundation of WS-CPFR 
 
The equipment maintenance cost contributes a major portion of the production costs in 
semiconductor manufacturing firms. The primary objective of the spare part inventory 
management is to ensure that the failed equipment items can be replaced right away to maintain 
satisfactory productivity. The characteristics of spare parts significantly differ from that of 
production items on criticality, specificity, demand pattern and part value (Huiskonen, 2001). 
Additionally, the proposed Web Services based CPFR system, namely WS-CPFR, considers the 
diagnostics and maintenance requirements such as work order release and auditing, failure 
resolution, preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance and corrective maintenance, etc. With 
this collaborative management system, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) can be lengthened 
as well as Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) can be shortened. 
The WSDF developed by Hung et al. (2003) and Hung et al. (2005) can automatically 
integrating diagnostics information with Web Services technologies. With WSDF, the functions 
of e-diagnostics and e-maintenance such as automatically collecting equipment data, remotely 
diagnosing, fixing, and monitoring equipment, and analyzing and predicting the equipment 
performance can be achieved over the Intranet and Internet. The proposed WS-CPFR is 
constructed on the basis of WSDF. Similar to WSDF, WS-CPFR can collect, integrate and 
exchange data and information among cross-network, cross-platform, and heterogeneous systems. 
In WS-CPFR, not only the diagnostics and maintenance related data, information and systems are 
integrated, but also those of the spare part logistics management are integrated to support the 
maintenance management objective of near-zero downtime. 
According to WSDF, in WS-CPFR, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is adopted as 
the messaging protocol to realize the inter-operation of cross-platform and distributed 
heterogeneous systems (SOAP specification). As well, Universal Description Discovery and 
Integration (UDDI) performs the directory function for locating the services on Web (UDDI 
specification). Web Services are programmable business application components expressed by 
Web Services Description Language (WSDL), and they are published on Web (WSDL 
specification). The heterogeneous information can be integrated and exchanged among 
cross-network and cross-platform by expressing data with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
(XML specification). 
In WSDF, the sub-systems in manufacturing factory side mainly include Equipment with 
Embedded Agents (EEA), On-site Diagnostics/Maintenance Server (ODMS), Local 
Diagnostics/Maintenance Database (LDMD), APC/OEE Server (AOS), and On-site 
Diagnosability/Maintainability Evaluator (ODME). In equipment supplier side, the sub-systems 
include Remote Diagnostics/Maintenance Server (RDMS), Global Diagnostics/Maintenance 
Database (GDMD), and Remote Diagnosability/Maintainability Evaluator (RDME) (Hung et al. 
2003; Hung et al. 2005).  
The On-site Logistics Management Server (OLMS) in semiconductor factory side and 
 8
1). WS-CPFR mainly integrates OLMS in the manufacturing firm (factory side) and RLMS in the 
equipment supplier (supplier side). Due to the transmission flexibility of Web services, OLMS 
and RLMS can easily incorporate with WS-CPFR and use the applications provided by Web 
services. Since the transmission between OLMS and RLMS is via SOAP protocol, WS-CPFR can 
be easily extended to the vision of globalization (refer to Figure 2). Multi-supplier and 
multi-factory can be included in the global architecture as in WSDF.

responsible for this step. In scenarios B, and D, the equipment supplier is responsible for this 
task. 
Step 7. Identify Exceptions for Order Forecast of Spare Parts: This step is similar to the step 
(Step 4) of identifying exceptions for demand forecast. Exception items for order forecast are 
explored based on pre-determined exception criteria. 
Step 8. Resolve/Collaborate on Exception Items for Order Forecast of Spare Parts: Similar 
to the step (Step 5) of resolving/collaborating on exception items for demand forecast, this step 
involves the process of investigating order forecast exceptions through querying shared data, 
email, telephone conversations, meetings, and so on and submitting any resulting changes to 
order forecast. 
Step 9. Generate Order of Spare Parts: Once the order forecasts are agreed, they can be 
changed into committed orders. No matter which side generates orders for replenishment, the 
focus is on meeting the replenishment procedure. In Scenario A, the semiconductor 
manufacturing firm is responsible for this step. In Scenarios B, C, and D, the equipment supplier 
is responsible for this task.

With Web Services, the proposed collaborative management platform, WS-CPFR, can easily 
integrate maintenance management system and CPFR as well as synchronize with other 
e-business applications. In semiconductor manufacturing, the vision of Device-to-Business (D2B) 
can be achieved through the proposed system. The CPFR functions of OLMS and RLMS are 
illustrated in Figures 9-43.

6. Conclusions 
 
With the rapid advancement of Internet and information technologies, the e-business 
applications have been broadened to e-diagnostics and e-maintenance in semiconductor industry. 
Through these advanced technologies, semiconductor manufacturers can remotely collect and 
monitor the real-time equipment data. Therefore, they can more accurately predict the failure 
pattern and failure time of equipment. This remote data collection and monitoring mechanisms 
can be incorporated with e-manufacturing in order to provide the inter-enterprise integration and 
information visibility for equipment status. 
The nine steps and primary four scenarios of CPFR proposed by VICS only provide 
guidelines for implementation, and these guidelines can be further designated for various 
industries by considering their characteristics. With respect to the requirements of spare parts in 
semiconductor equipment, this project develops a Web Services based CPFR system, WS-CPFR, 
for collaboratively planning, forecasting and replenishing spare parts between fabs and suppliers. 
The developed WS-CPFR system assists maintenance engineers to make right decisions on 
replenishment of spare parts to reduce equipment downtime, maintenance cost and production 
loss.
