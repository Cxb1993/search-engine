response, i.e. good frequency selectivity and controllable bandwidth,
at the targeted rejection band. The new antenna is realized by utilizing
two pairs of horizontally placed folded-strip resonators with a novel
inductive coupling scheme. The goal of the design is to overcome
several drawbacks noticed in our previous work of [5]. Some prelim-
inary results have been introduced in [9], and in this communication
the antenna will be examined and optimized in detail. The antenna
conﬁguration and design methodology are introduced in Section II.
The tunability of the rejection band is discussed in Section III along
with parametric studies. Section IV discussed a new equivalent circuit
model with improved accuracy, and the radiation characteristics are
illustrated in Section V. A brief summary will be given at the end of
this communication.
II. CONFIGURATION AND DESIGN METHODOLOGY
The band-notched antenna in [5] suffers from the following draw-
backs. First, the impedance matching is unsatisfactory at both UWB
low and high bands. Second, via holes are necessarily required and sig-
niﬁcantly increases the fabrication cost. In addition, due to the strong
fringing ﬁelds of the vertically placed folded-strip resonators, as shown
in Fig. 1(a), the antenna is prone to nearby coupling. It inevitably in-
creases the measuring complexity and limits the practical applications.
Last but not the least, in terms of the return loss response, which is not
shown in [5], the accuracy of the antenna equivalent circuit model is
far from satisfactory.
To deal with the difﬁculties, in this communication a new band-re-
jected ultrawideband planar monopole antenna is proposed by utilizing
two pairs of inductively coupled resonators. The conﬁguration of the
antenna is illustrated in Fig. 2 along with the geometric parameters.
The antenna lies in the xy-plane with its normal direction being par-
allel to the z axis. It is symmetric about the centerline, and consists of a
microstrip feed line, a truncated ground plane, a ﬂared metal plate, and
two pairs of folded strips. The ﬂaredmetal plate serves as an impedance
matching network as well as a wideband radiator since the energy can
transform smoothly from the feed line to free space via the tapered aper-
tures. The folded strips function as two pairs of band-notched parallel
resonators for creating the rejection band. Depending on the geometric
locations, the resonators are referred to as the exterior and interior res-
onators, respectively, in the following discussion. The subscripts “e”
and “i” are used to distinguish the parameters.
The main difference between the proposed antenna and that in [5]
is the realization of the folded-strip resonators. In the current design,
the folded-strip resonators are horizontally placed on the top layer of
the substrate. Based on the full-wave simulation, Fig. 1 illustrates the

fringing electric ﬁelds and surface current distributions of both verti-
cally and horizontally placed folded-strip resonators. Referring to the
ﬁgure, the uniplanar folded strip in Fig. 1(b) can signiﬁcantly reduce
the nearby coupling since the fringing ﬁelds are more concentrated
along the coupling edges. On the positive side, it improves the an-
tenna impedance matching and simpliﬁes the measurement setup. It
cuts down the fabrication cost and makes the antenna more suitable for
practical applications as well. However, on the negative side, it also
poses a new problem. Since the fringing ﬁelds are mostly trapped by
the coupling edges, the coupling between any two adjacent resonators
is relatively weak. Accordingly, the adjacent resonators can be hardly
formed a pair of coupled resonators for synthesizing the required band-
stop-ﬁlter-like response at the targeted rejection band.
To deal with this issue, a novel inductive coupling scheme is pro-
posed, as illustrated in Fig. 3. By connecting the open ends of the ex-
terior and interior resonators with a short line section, additional cur-
rent path can be introduced to provide an adequate amount of coupling
between the adjacent resonators. It effectively improves the rejection
band response at 5–6 GHz. The coupling by the short line is princi-
pally inductive, and can be modeled by a  -inverter, or equivalently, a
-network with three inductors. One of the inductors is positive, and
the remaining two are conceptually negative. All inductors have the
same absolute value of 
 
[10]. The inductive coupling plays a key
role in realizing the bandstop-ﬁlter-like response at the notched band.
A detailed investigation of the inductive coupling scheme will be given
in Sections III and IV.
The design procedure of the proposed antenna can be summarized
as follows. First, the resonance frequencies of the exterior and interior
resonators are chosen by adjusting the lengths of the folded-strip
resonators, i.e.  

and  

. The resonance frequencies of the two
resonators can be intentionally different from each other by a small

of the rejection band for a speciﬁc design. For the current antenna, the
rejection bandwidth with       	 
 can be adjusted from
40 MHz (0.1 mm) to 480 MHz (0.9 mm).
IV. EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL
In this section, an equivalent circuit model incorporating both
lumped and distributed elements is discussed to get an even clearer
understanding of the proposed antenna. For simplicity, in the following
discussion, the subscripts “e” and “i” are omitted unless otherwise
speciﬁcally indicated.
The antenna modeling begins with the modeling of each individual
folded-strip resonator. In [5], the folded-strip resonator is simply mod-
eled by a lumped lossy parallel resonant circuit whose element values

 

 

 
 can be extracted using the standard one-port-param-
eter. The modeling is straightforward, but the accuracy suffers. To im-
prove the accuracy, as shown in Fig. 6(a), two additional elements,

and

, are added to the equivalent circuit model to account for the dis-
tributive nature of the folded-strip resonator. The resistance

repre-
sents the parasitic radiation from the resonator, while the capacitance


accounts for the fringing ﬁeld at the open end of the folded strip.
Together with the lossy parallel resonator model, the input impedance
of each individual folded-strip resonator can be approximated by the
equation shown in Fig. 6(a).
The element values 
 
 
 
 
 
 of the lossy parallel resonator
can be determined using the extraction method in [5]. It will not be
repeated here to avoid redundancy. The values of the additional ele-
ments 

 

 are determined by curve-ﬁtting the calculated one-
port -parameter to the full-wave simulated one with Agilent ADS.
Table I summarizes the extracted element values of both interior and
exterior resonators. For demonstration purpose, Fig. 6(b) compares the
calculated input impedance of the exterior resonator using the circuit
model to the full-wave simulated one using HFSS. Excellent agree-
ment can be observed. As compared to the original model in [5], the
modeling accuracy of the folded-strip resonator has shown signiﬁcant
improvement.

ELEMENT VALUES OF THE LUMPED CIRCUIT MODELS FOR THE RESONATORS
The units of the inductor, capacitor, and resistor are nH, pF, and  .
Fig. 7. Equivalent circuit model of the proposed antenna with improved
accuracy.
By utilizing the improved resonator modeling, a novel equivalent cir-
cuit model is presented for the proposed band-rejected UWB antenna,
as illustrated in Fig. 7. Referring to the ﬁgure, each of the four folded-
strip resonators is represented by the network in Fig. 6(a). The inductive
coupling sections are accounted for by the -inverters, as suggested in
Fig. 3. The -inverters connect the open ends of the exterior and inte-
rior resonators, while the capacitors
  
and
 
again represent the
fringing ﬁelds of the resonators. In contrast to [5], here the ﬂared metal
plate is described by a distributive transmission line model with two
four-section stepped-impedance microstrip lines. The detailed struc-
ture of the stepped line is shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The two pairs of
inductively coupled resonators are connected together with amicrostrip
feed line with a length of 

and characteristic impedance of 

. In
addition to the improvement of the modeling of the folded-strip res-
onator and ﬂared metal plate, the distributive radiation behavior along
the strips is emphasized in the circuit model as well. An additional radi-
ation resistance
	

is serially connected to the feed line to account for
the radiation from the ﬂared metal plate to free space. We believe that
these modiﬁcations are capable of providing a more accurate antenna
modeling with physical insight. The cross coupling effect between any
two adjacent resonators, on the other hand, is so weak that it is ignored
in the circuit model.
The extraction of the components of the antenna circuit model in
Fig. 7 is more involved due to the complicated interconnection of the
elements. An explicit expression for the antenna input impedance is
impractical. Instead, the element values are determined by curve-ﬁt-
ting the calculated one-port 	-parameter using the circuit model to the
full-wave simulated one by HFSS with Agilent ADS. The extracted el-
ement values, including the -inverters, stepped lines, and series radi-
ation resistance, are summarized in Table II. To numerically verify the

at      , 45 , 90 , and 135 . Though suffering from some degrada-
tion at the boresight direction      , it is clear that as the recep-
tion angle varies, the signal attenuation remains better than 10 dB. At
    
 
, the rejection level can reach up to 25 dB. When compared
with the design in [5], the proposed antenna demonstrates much more
stable rejection-band radiation characteristics against spatial variations.
In addition, at the azimuth plane      , the variation of the gain
response is less than 5 dB at both sub-bands, a desirable result which
reduces the distortion introduced by the transceiving antenna. The gain
variations in other planes are a little bit higher, but remain principally
lower than 10 dB in the operating bands.
VI. CONCLUSION
A novel UWB planar monopole antenna with bandstop-ﬁlter-like
rejection response using inductively coupling scheme has been investi-
gated thoroughly in this communication. The signal rejection is better
than 5 dB from 5.075–5.375 GHz. The maximum rejection level is
2.72 dB. At the band edges, the frequency fall-off rate reaches up to
6 dB per 100 MHz. The rejection bandwidth, on a 5-dB return loss
level, can be controlled from 40 to 480 MHz. The radiation patterns
are nearly omnidirectional in the yz-plane with a maximum gain of
4 dBi. According to the antenna gain and phase responses, the proposed
design is suitable for applications in both DS-UWB and MB-OFDM
systems.
An antenna equivalent circuit model with improved accuracy has
been discussed as well. When compared with our previous work, the
proposed design features signiﬁcant improvements in many aspects.
First, the horizontally arranged folded-strip resonators greatly reduce
the nearby coupling. It improves the measurement accuracy and fa-
cilitates the integration with other circuitries. In addition, no via hole
is required which can lower down the fabrication cost. In view of the
antenna performance, the impedance matching is improved while the
rejected band response is less dependent on the spatial variations.
