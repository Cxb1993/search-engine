Abstract 
  This study is to investigate the influence of different impregnating methods 
(pressure, vacuum/pressure) and precursors (coal tar pitch, phenolic resin) on physical 
properties, mechanical properties and tribological properties of carbon/carbon (C/C) 
composites. 
  The results indicate that the specimen densified with coal tar pitch precursor 
through vacuum/pressure impregnation has the highest infilitration efficiency and the 
best tribological performance. The specimen reinforced with short carbon fiber shows 
better formation and properties. 
  Based on the performance of bulk density, hardness and tribological properties of 
specimen. The specimen prepared with coal tar pitch precursor, short carbon fiber, 
and densified through vacuum/pressure impregnating methods shows the best 
performance.

初步碳化處理。經初步碳化後之試片因非碳元素散逸而成一多孔性結構，須進一
步進行緻密化過程；而緻密化過程主要是將碳前驅體含浸液分別以加壓與真空/
加壓兩種含浸方式，滲入多孔性之預型材試片中，並進行重複緻密化循環，藉此
減少試片之孔隙率。 
 
本研究會採用兩種含浸方式：一為直接加壓含浸，主要是先將少部分碳前
驅體含浸液倒入自製模具內，接著放置試片，最後再將含浸液加至模具內約八分
滿，藉由油壓機在模具上施以50MPa之壓力並加壓5分鐘(圖3-2)，強迫含浸液滲
入於孔洞、裂縫處，藉此達到緻密化效果；另一種方式則採用真空/加壓含浸方
式，先將試片置於真空含浸設備(圖3-3)內，並將含浸設備內部壓力抽取至終端壓
力( 1.3×10-1 Pa )，目的是使試片內之孔隙及裂縫之內壓力低於外界大氣壓力，使
存在於空孔、裂縫處之空氣散逸，接下來會因模具內外壓力差，使得含浸液可滲
入試片孔洞及裂縫中，緊接著再使用加壓含浸方式，重複上述加壓步驟施以
50MPa之壓力加壓5分鐘，強迫含浸液滲入於孔洞、裂縫處，藉此達緻密化效果。

transition metal particles as the reaction catalyst to reduce the growth temperature. 
The automotive brake lining composed of fibrous reinforcements, internal lubricant, and 
friction modifier are usually bound with phenolic resins [7-8]. Some studies have been focused on 
the tribological properties of brake lining with different compositions of the components [9-11]. 
Notably, the high performance brake lining material must possess characters of stable friction and 
low wear under varying operating speeds, applied loads, temperature, and environment. To achieve 
the low wear property, a brake lining need to be tough, heat-resistant, and have predictable thermal 
degradation behavior [12]. However, an organic brake lining material subjected to a high 
temperature environment usually experiences a phenomenon called “fade” [7, 12-15], in which the 
normal low-temperature coefficient of friction μ decreases temporarily. An automotive brake lining 
material requires being light and able to resist high temperature and absorb enough friction energy 
[15] for safety reasons. Because of the inherent thermal degradation character of the organic 
material, a better thermal resistant material is highly demanded. The CNT which is known to have 
properties of low density and high thermal resistance is considered by the authors to be the best 
candidate for such application. In stead of employing commercial carbon nanotubes which is 
difficult to disperse and still quite high cost at present for preparing the braking lining materials, 
this study disperses the iron catalyst homogeneously through sol-gel method with the commercial 
friction powder to grow carbon nanotubes in-situ by the CVD process for preparing the carbon 
nanotube containing brake lining material.  
parameters were measured by the water immersion method according to the ASTM C-20. 
 
Flexural strength 
    Based on the ASTM D-790 method, the flexural strength was determined using three-point 
bending test on the Instron test machine (Shimadzu, AGS-500A, Japan) with the cross-head speed 1 
mm/min. The cross-section of the specimen bar is 5×2.5 mm and the length of the support span is 
35 mm. The flexural strength of specimens is calculated according to the equation listed in the 
following:  
σ = 3PL/2WT2  
where P is the maximum load, L is the length of support span, W and T are the width and the 
thickness of the specimens, respectively. 
 
Friction and wear tests 
    Friction and wear tests were conducted using a homemade disc-on-disc sliding wear tester, as 
schematically shown in Fig. 1. The square-shaped (32 mm x 32 mm) counterface material is 
SAE-G2500 gray cast iron [16] (the rotor material). Prior to testing, the wear test specimens 
(included cast iron disc and CNT containing brake lining materials) were polished through a level 
of #1200 grit paper, followed by ultrasonic cleaning and drying. A fixed load of 1.2 MPa, constant 
rotor speed of 1000 rpm (linear speed is 0.67 m/s) and testing time of 300 sec (sliding distance is 
200 m) were used in every wear test. A strain gage-equipped LRK-100K load cell (NTS Technology, 
Nara, Japan) was used to determine the friction coefficient. The weight loss was measured and 
averaged from the CNT containing brake lining material for each run. 
 
Microstructure 
A Hitachi S-4700 (Hitachi, Japan) scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine 
morphologies and typical worn surface of those specimens after experiencing the wear test.  
 
Results and discussion 
Microstructure 
The microstructures of CNT /friction powder are shown in Fig. 2. As indicated by arrow signs 
in Fig. 2(b), many CNTs and amorphous carbon clusters were generated at the same time through 
would cause the poor formation of the specimen and reduce reinforced efficiency. 
 
Friction and wear 
Typical of friction coefficient curves in response to concentration of catalyst and ratio of C2H2 
/N2 under the same load (1.2 MPa) and speed (1000 rpm) are shown in Fig. 5. For most specimens, 
the friction coefficient rose abruptly when wear test started, then declined slowly toward a steady 
value. In comparison with the green specimen, the friction coefficient curves of the CNTs 
containing brake lining specimens were almost lower and more stable. As the concentration of 
catalyst increased, the friction coefficient curves of CNTs containing brake lining specimens during 
the wear test were lower and smoother. Among those specimens with different concentration of 
catalyst, the C2 specimen shows the lowest friction coefficient and more stable variation in friction 
coefficient curve. Among those specimens with different ratio of C2H2 /N2, the A30 specimen shows 
the lowest and most stable friction coefficient curve. Nevertheless, specimens with higher ratio of 
C2H2 /N2 didn’t reflect lower and more stable friction coefficient curve. This phenomenon will be 
discussed further in the next paragraph.  
    Weight losses of specimens with different process parameters after experiencing the same load 
(1.2 MPa) and speed (1000 rpm) wear test were compared in Fig. 6. Among all CNTs containing 
brake lining specimens, the A30 (or C2) specimen had the lowest weight losses (19 mg). The weight 
losses decrease further with the concentration of catalyst. However, the weight losses increase with 
the ratio of C2H2 /N2 when the flow ratio of C2H2 /N2 is over than 30/70. The A60 specimen had the 
largest weight losses (40 mg). It seems that the weight loss of the green specimen is more fluctuant 
and much higher than all of the CNT containing brake lining specimens. Based on the observation 
of friction and wear results, it implies that although CNTs could improve tribological performance 
of brake lining specimens; however, larger quantities of amorphous carbon clusters in CNT /friction 
powder produced from high ratio of C2H2 /N2 would cause poor formation of CNTs containing 
brake lining specimens and reduce efficiency of tribological improvement. It should be noted that 
the weight losses of specimens decreases with their flexural strength and roughly proportional to 
their open porosity. It also shows that the weight losses of specimens are roughly related to their 
friction coefficient curves. The lower the friction coefficient and the smoother the curve is, the 
lower the weight loss is. 
 
 Conclusion 
1. The CNTs containing brake lining specimens showed lower porosity than that of green 
specimen. The CNT containing brake lining specimens prepared through 2.0 M catalyst 
concentration and 30% C2H2 show the lowest open porosity and best properties. 
2. CNTs could improve the mechanical and tribological performances of specimens. However, too 
many amorphous carbon clusters derived from high ratio of C2H2 /N2 or too little CNTs 
produced from low catalyst concentration would cause poor formation and reduce reinforced 
efficiency. It seems that the well balance in proper concentration of catalyst and ratio of C2H2 
/N2 could provide the best mechanical and tribological performance of CNT containing brake 
lining specimens.

Introduction 
Mullite is known to be an advanced high temperature ceramic due to its remarkable physical 
and chemical properties [1-2]. Many methods are available for mullite synthesis. Among these 
developed methods, sol-gel method provides maximum homogeneity of alumina and silica species 
resulting in the formation of mullite at relatively lower temperatures compared to the other 
conventional methods [3-5]. To synthesize stoichiometric mullite (3Al2O3-2SiO2), boehmite 
(AlOOH) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, Si(OC2H5)4) are often used as precursors for alumina and 
silica, respectively. 
Carbon nanotubes, discovered by Iijima in 1991 [6], with outstanding chemical and physical 
properties have become the potential reinforced materials in various technological applications [1]. 
Many deposition methods [7-11] have been reported on the CNT synthesis. The chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) process, one very popular and low cost method for growing CNTs, adopts 
transition metal particles such as Fe, Co or Ni as the reaction catalyst to reduce the growth 
temperature. The transition metal catalysts were often found to be incorporated into the silica or 
alumina framework substrate [12-14] when TEOS is selected as the precursor for silica substrate to 
synthesize CNTs. A high performance braking materials is often required to have good mechanical 
property, high wear resistance and high tribological performance. Our previous work has shown that 
the CNTs have better tribological performance, which stabilized the friction coefficient. Therefore, 
the paper intend to integrate both merits of the mullite which provides rather good mechanical 
properties and high wear resistance and the CNTs which can stabilize the friction coefficient using a 
simple process. Since the boehmite and tetraethoxysilane are often used as precursors for mullite, 
and Fe(NO3)3 and tetraethoxysilane are applied as the catalyst in substrate for growing CNT, we 
mixing them three at once to grow both the mullite and CNTs through CVD process at the same 
time. In this study, we prepared the Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/ boehmite catalyst sol-gel with different CVD 
growing processes to generate fabricate different CNT /aluminosilicate powders. The performances 
of these CNT /aluminosilicate composites were also investigated.  
 
Experimental Procedures 
Fe(NO3)3/ TEOS / boehmite catalyst powder preparation 
There were two steps in preparing the Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/boehmite catalyst sol-gel. Firstly, 
boehmite (AlOOH) was used as the precursor for alumina and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, Si(OC2H5)4) 
and two-step reaction process at 750 OC to1300 OC were designated as FTB 750, FTB 1300 and 
FTB750-1300 individually. 
 
Characterization of the catalyst and the CNTs 
X-ray diffractometer (Scintag, X-4000, USA) with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation was operated at 
30 kV and 20 mA. Data were collected between 10 and 90 o (2θ) in a scanning speed of 2 o/min to 
identify the various phases of CNT/aluminosilicate powders prepared through 
Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/boehmite catalyst sol-gel adopted by different CVD growing/calcining processes. 
Those various phases were identified by matching each characteristic XRD peak with that compiled 
in JCPDS files. 
The morphologies and microstructure of the CNT/aluminosilicate powders were observed 
using the Hitachi S-4700 (Tokyo, Japan) field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) 
and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Some CNT/aluminosilicate products were also 
examined by FEI transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 20 S-Twin，Holland). The 
TEM specimens were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing grinded the CNT/aluminosilicate 
products in alcohol and then making several droplets on TEM copper grids. The samples were 
observed at various TEM power up to 200 keV. 
 
Hardness test 
    Hardness values of all specimens were determined at HRR (Rockwell, R scale) levels by a 
hardness test machine (Akashi, ATK-600, Japan). The used indenter was a 12.7 mm spherical steel 
ball, the applying load was 60 kgf and the testing position was along the radial direction of the 
specimen. At least, five positions were tested for each set of samples and the average values of 
hardness were measured. 
 
Friction and wear tests 
    Friction and wear tests were conducted using a homemade disc-on-disc sliding wear tester, as 
schematically shown in Fig. 1. The square-shaped (32 mm x 32 mm) counterface material is 
SAE-G2500 gray cast iron (the rotor material). Prior to testing, the wear test specimens (included 
cast iron disc and CNT/aluminosilicate composites) were polished through a level of #1200 grit 
paper, followed by ultrasonic cleaning and drying. A fixed load of 1.2 MPa, constant rotor speed of 
4(b)). The diameter of these silica nanowires were about 50~100 nm. It should be noted that CNTs 
were seldom observed in the FTB 1300 specimen. It is possible that the reaction temperature at 
1300 OC for one-step reaction (continuous) process is too high to synthesize CNTs. At 1300 OC, the 
elemental carbon decomposed from C2H2 is hard to precipitate from Fe3C to form CNTs because 
most of the precursor has been transform into liquid iron instead of Fe3C. On the contrary, the iron 
atom became as the catalyst for silica nanowires synthesis. TEM observations also showed that 
mullite and α-Al2O3 crystalline phases were also detected at 1300 OC for one-step reaction 
(continuous) process. 
It seems that the two-step reaction process for FTB 750-1300 specimen can synthesize CNTs 
and mullite successfully (Fig. 3(e)-(f) and Fig. 4(c)). In the first step of the two-step reaction 
process, CNTs were synthesized firstly at 750 OC. For the second step, the alumina and silica 
components in Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/boehmite catalyst sol-gel were transformed into mullite. It should 
be noted, although the SiO2 evidence of were detected by XRD analysis, silica nanowires were also 
rarely observed in the FTB 750-1300 specimen. A more plausible explanation for the XRD peak of 
SiO2 detected by XRD analysis is that the cristobalite is produced from the silica sources at 1300 
OC. The result is distinct from the FTB 1300 specimen. There are two possible reasons to explain 
the phenomena. First, most of catalyst was provided to synthesize CNTs in the first step of the 
two-step reaction process. The residual catalyst was not enough to synthesize silica nanowires. 
Second, most of silica sources were transformed into mullite and cristobalite at 1300 OC. The 
residual silica sources and catalyst were inadequate to meet the needs for the silica nanowires 
syntheses. 
 
Hardness 
    As shown in Fig. 5, the average hardness of each specimen with different CNT/aluminosilicate 
powders was approximately analogous. However, the specimens with higher growing/calcining 
temperatures generally showed the higher hardness. This observation implies that the 
CNT/aluminosilicate powders prepared through higher growing/calcining temperatures could 
improve the hardness of specimens. Among those specimens prepared through different 
CNT/aluminosilicate powders, the FTB 750-1300 specimen shows the highest hardness. One 
possible explanation for the phenomena is that products such as CNTs, mullite,α-Al2O3 transformed 
from the Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/boehmite catalyst sol-gel through the two-step reaction process could 
provide better mechanical properties of the specimens. 
 
1. Different CNT/aluminosilicate powders were synthesized through Fe(NO3)3/ TEOS/boehmite 
catalyst powders with different CVD growing/calcining processes. By adopting the one-step 
reaction (continuous) process at 750 OC, the products were CNTs and γ-Al2O3. By adopting the 
one-step reaction (continuous) process at 1300 OC, the products were silica nanowires,α-Al2O3 
and mullite. In addition, the two-step reaction process could synthesize CNTs, mullite and 
α-Al2O3. 
2. CNTs, mullite,α-Al2O3 transformed from the Fe(NO3)3/TEOS/boehmite catalyst sol-gel through 
the two-step reaction process could provide better mechanical and tribological properties of the 
specimens. CNTs could improve the tribological performance and stabilize the friction 
coefficient of specimens. Furthermore, those ceramic products such as mullite,α-Al2O3 
transformed at higher calcining temperatures could provide better mechanical properties and 
wear resistance.
