There are two dierent approahes in the
eld of ontemporary graphis rendering pro-
essing: one is alled photorealisti rendering
that deals with how to produe realisti eets;
the other is non-photorealisti rendering that
fouses on how to generate artisti style paint-
ings [5℄. In the area of hair simulation, inter-
estingly, also has the similar two approahes.
To date papers addressing two dimensional
hair simulations have rarely been proposed,
omparing to the researh on the popular three
dimensional hair simulations. Moreover, the
existing two dimensional hair simulation re-
sults are often sti. That is partly due to the
fat that the struture of human hair in the
works of art highly depends on designer's ideas.
It is diÆult to nd an eetive way to ana-
lyze, not to mention, to generate 2D artisti
hair styles.
Here we propose a robust approah to ex-
amine many kinds of hair styles and to build
a plasti system of 2D hair styles. Using our
proposed system, designers an reate fantasti
hair styles at ease.
We use 1) Eulidean Distane Transform to
trae out the ow diretion of hair; 2) B-spline
urves to draw its outlines, and 3) statisti
methods to analyze its texture features inside
the hair lines. To eetively generate the 2D
hairs, we design a friendly user interfae whih
allows designers to reate any hair styles they
want. Integrating with B-spline equations, L-
system, and Perlin noise tehniques, our sys-
tem an model the hair styles that only exist
in people's imaginative minds before.
The projet ontains many innovative ideas
relating to hair style analysis and reation,
that ertainly will benet further researhes on
2D artisti hair styles. Our researhing work
an extend the appliations to image reogni-
tion, hair simulations, plasti arts design sys-
tem, NPR, as well as various entertainment do-
mains.

Computer graphis ommunity always holds
an interest on virtual humans. In most har-
ateristis, hairstyle is an important fator in
the piture of a human. Human an look om-
pletely dierent sometimes with a small hange
to his or her hairstyle. Therefore, hair has been
a subjet of thorough researh in omputer
graphis. However, it is a real hallenge to
draw a natural hair-like urve for omputer due
to its omplex and irregular variations. Thus,
several researhes that improve hair rendering
were delivered in reent years. The tehniques
most developed fous on generating 3D photo-
realisti hair, or on animating this hair using
omplex physial models. Many researh ef-
forts have been devoted to addressing eah of
these issues [6℄.
However, few authors suggest solutions to
render non-photorealisti hair suh as that
produed in the artoon industry [3℄. To
reate non-photorealisti omputer generated
hairstyles, it is imperative to explore teh-
niques for synthesizing hair. Hair on haraters
often reveals important elements of personali-
ties and emotions. Usually, the number of hair
strands on a real head an reah huge ounts.
In omi-style hair, artists do not try to draw
strands separately. Instead, they only desribe
a hairstyle using nite urves to approximate
the visual eet produed together. Here we
fous on non-photorealisti hair model, whih
has various advantages based on its simpliity,
exaggeration and additional eets even if it is
of less reality.

Based on the onsiderations, we desribe in
this projet an interative omputer system for
generating human hairstyle. Our system aims
to simplify the artist's work on hair reation.
Instead of asking a user to put strands or lus-
ters together to build up a hairstyle, it only

a automati approah to simulate the skethy
style eet. A non-photorealisti sketh on-
sists of the following steps: 1) segmentation, 2)
spline approximation [1℄, and 3) stroke render-
ing.
Our system is implemented using JAVA on
PC with AMD Athlon XP2800+ CPU and
512MB RAM.
The system provides a simplied version of
interfae that an be used by novie. However,
eah artist has his/her own preferenes in art-
work. We provide two dierent drawing styles:
drawing a omplex strand using a simple spine
line with various hair brushes, or using a om-
plex spine line with a single hair brush. As
shown in Figure 2, two similar hair strands are
generated using dierent brush models.
System an generate several hairstyles with
the same spine line sets using dierent brush
models. Figure 3-(e) and 3-(f) shows dier-
ent hair styles in over mode. These are the
outputs that apply the drawing tehnique pre-
sented in Figure 2.

In this projet, we present a framework to
model and design non-photorealisti hairstyles.
A variety of hair an be generated using a small
number of parameters. Therefore, the system
an enhane the workow in the artist drawing.
However, our system has some limitations we
hope to address in the future work. In omi
artwork, eah part of hair has its own salieny,
suh as fringes, sideburns, and rown. Eah of
these has dierent tehniques to draw it. Wisp
model in our system belongs to the ategory
of fringe and rown. In intat hair generator,
we use the basi fundamental tools presented
in this system to generate a omplete hairstyle
automatially. We have to design an approah
that an gradually deform the ontat between
dierent hair parts.
As the non-photorealisti hair generator,
there are some reasons that the hair we gen-
erated does not like the real drawing of artist.
First, brush model onforms the brush on hair
strand. We plan to develop an approah that
segments hair strand. Therefore, eah segment
an have its own monopolisti brushes. We
expet that artist an onstrut the vivid and
unique brush suitable for eah strand segment.
Seond, hairs drawn by generator and artist
rely on the same basi drawing primitives and
tehniques. But artisti drawing ontains some
additional artisti or human omponents that
make the results more graphially. We plan
to design a stylised approah to simulate the
artisti skills to improve hair brush. Our sys-
tem aims not only to reate the general srib-
ble hairstyles, but also to automatially pro-
due the sophistiated hair modeling that an
be designed by any artist.
