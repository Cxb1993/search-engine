本研究提出一個非破壞性的方法，用以同時量測多晶薄膜之楊式係數與浦松比。此方法使
用雷射光學曲率測量薄膜應力，並使用 sin2ψX 光繞射法測量薄膜內之應變量。而後將所量
得之應力與應變經由線性彈性力學之計算獲得楊式係數與浦松比。此方法分別應用於 TiN
與 ZrN 兩種典型薄膜試片，其 X 光光源使用同步輻射光源與實驗室 X 光光源。實驗所量得
之彈性係數，再結合 cos2αsin2ψX 光繞射法所測量薄膜內之應變量計算得到薄膜應力，將此
應力與同一試片經由雷射光學曲率法所量得之應力值相比較，其結果相近，因而證實本研
究所提出之方法的正確性與可靠性。利用調整 X 光入射角以改變 X 光入射深度，加上本方
法所量得之彈性係數，亦可用於評估薄膜內應力梯度分佈。本研究亦發現，由奈米壓痕法
所測量之楊式係數值與壓痕深度相關。因此，將奈米壓痕法量得之揚式係數用於 sin2ψ 或 
cos2αsin2ψX 光繞射法以計算薄膜應力時，不一定能得到正確之應力值。

Abstract 
In this study, we have proposed a non-destructive method to simultaneously determine the 
Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) of polycrystalline thin film materials. The method 
involved independent stress measurement by laser curvature technique and strain components 
determination by sin2ψ X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, and afterward, elasticity theory was 
employed to calculate E and ν. The proposed method was applied on two model specimens, TiN 
and ZrN thin films, using synchrotron X-ray and laboratory X-ray sources, respectively. The 
cos2αsin2ψ XRD method which measured the strain for diffraction planes at different location 
was performed on the same film, and the previously determined E and ν were used to calculate 
the stress. The residual stresses derived from cos2αsin2ψ method were close to the stresses from 
laser curvature measurements, which validated the measured values of E and ν. The depth profile 
of residual stress of the TiN thin film was assessed using cos2αsin2ψ method by appropriately 
adjusting the X-ray incident angle. In addition, the E value determined from nanoindentation 
(NIP) may depend on the indentation depth. Therefore, one should be cautious when employing 
the NIP-determined E in sin2ψ or cos2αsin2ψ methods to calculate the residual stress because the 
modulus may not always give correct stress value.
