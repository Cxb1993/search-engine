Abstract 
Foodstuff is all-important to people. Food 
is a necessary part in our daily life that has a 
close relationship with taste and olfaction in our 
five sense systems. Besides, color of food, even 
the color design of the apparent package would 
not only affect our appetites, but the sense flavor 
[1]. This study aimed at exploring color 
psychological perception about taste image and 
olfaction image. Through the quantitative 
methods of fuzzy numbers, fuzzy total utility 
values and fuzzy utility similarity, a 
color-combination evaluation model was built 
based on the taste/olfaction image perception. 
The experimental results indicated the following 
assumptions. (1) The subjects mostly associate 
the taste of food with the food’s colors. (2) The 
image perceptions of single colors and two-color 
combinations on taste and olfaction are highly 
identical. (3) Multiple color combinations 
decrease the perceptual degree of taste and 
olfaction images. 
The study proceeds with the taste and 
olfaction image evaluation experiments on 
single colors, two-color combinations, and three 
color combinations to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, 
three packaging cases were designed based on 
the evaluation of ‘taste’, ‘olfaction’, and ‘taste + 
olfaction’ images.

3. Color Design Examples 
3.1 Case 1: color design for the package of 
taste-related food 
A two-color pickle gift package was taken 
in the current study as the color-design example 
of the taste-related merchandise. Two colors of 
the green/pink tone with their RGB parameters, 
C1(177, 216, 86) and C2(219, 81, 109), were 
specified for this design (shown as Figure 2). 
Designer A intended this design felt sour, sweet 
and a little spicy for the accordance with the real 
pickle inside. The color area ratio of C1 and C2 
is 0.4 versus 0.6. Through the proposed image 
evaluation model, the taste-image similarity 
result was calculated in Table 1. It shows that 
the sour and sweet images is nearest to medium 
degrees (the corresponding intensities 0.90 and 
0.87), and the spicy image is nearest to medium 
low degree (intensity 0.86). Therefore, the 
designer might check whether the evaluation 
meets his/her image goal and modify the color 
setting.

4. Conclusion 
Color plays a key role for customers in 
determining what they like or dislike. Although 
many of the tasks performed by a designer at the 
color-planning design stage involve the 
consideration of user’s perception of the 
package’s color, very few computer-aided 
design systems are available to support these 
design activities. A quantitative evaluation 
method based on the RGB (i.e. R(Red), G(Green) 
and B(Blue)) color system is proposed in this 
article. The proposed model helps designers to 
diagnose their color design and to recognize the 
tendencies about the taste and olfaction images. 
Thus, the color scheme might be redesign for 
several times towards the desired taste and 
olfaction images.
