organic dyes.  A large amount of 
TFP-containing wastewater is being discharged 
from the spin coating process.  Accordingly, 
handling the wastewater economically and 
effectively is a significant issue for the 
environmental protection. 
Recent researches have suggested some 
processes for treating TFP-containing wastewater, 
including O3/H2O2 [4], Fenton [5], Fered-Fenton 
[6], pervaporation with a hybrid process [7], 
supercritical fluid fractionation (SFF) [8], 
reverse osmosis (RO) [9] and air stripping [9].  
However, to the knowledge of the authors, the 
degradation of aqueous TFP by UV254nm/O3 or 
UV185nm/O3 has not been investigated. 
The process, consisting of a combination of 
UV and ozone, is based on the production of 
highly reactive free radicals, mainly hydroxyl 
radicals, in aqueous solution.  The hydroxyl 
radicals can then react non-selectively with 
aqueous organic pollutants at high rates.  A lot 
of applications have recently been reported 
[10-24].  In recent years, advances in 
ozone-generating technologies have made the 
application of ozone in wastewater treatment 
much more economic and effective [25].  In 
this work, three approaches (UV185nm, 
UV254nm/O3 and UV185nm/O3) to the degradation 
of aqueous TFP were compared and effects of 
pH and temperature investigated. 
Experimental 
Chemicals 
99.7% TFP was obtained from Seedchem Co., 
Ltd.  Potassium indigo trisulfonate, used to 
measure aqueous ozone concentration, was 
obtained from Acros Organics, Inc.  All of these 
chemicals were analytical grade and used 
without further purification. 
Equipment 
Figure 1 schematically depicts the experimental 
system employed in this investigation.  The 
reactor was made entirely of acrylic plastic with 
an effective volume of 10 liters.  All 
experimental solutions were prepared with 
deionized water to prevent any interference from 
impurities.  Test solutions were buffered by 
adding a borate buffer, and H3PO4 or NaOH was 
used to yield the desired pH.  8.0 L solution 
was used in each experiment and the total 
sampling volume was within 5% of the initial 
amount.  Ozone was generated by an ozone 
generator (KIA-03-2A, Three Oxygen, Co., 
Taiwan) using pure oxygen from a commercial 
cylinder.  The ozone concentration was 
controlled by the number of switch-on electrode 
tubes in the ozone generator with a constant 
volumetric oxygen feed rate of 3 L/min.  Each 
reaction was conducted with the liquid in a batch 
mode and ozone-rich oxygen was introduced to 
the liquid bottom via a gas sparger.  The liquid 
was heated by a 450-W electrical heater and kept 
at temperatures of 26, 37, 48, and 60Â±2 oC, 
respectively, by a controller with a Teflon-coated 
K-type thermocouple.  A quartz sleeve with an 
outside diameter of 5.0 cm was set along the axis 
of the reactor and two low-pressure mercury UV 
lamps were inserted (HNS 10 W/U OZ or OFR, 
Osram Co., Italy).  The photon flux of UV used 
to irradiate the reacting liquid was estimated to 
be 2.50 W/L. 
Procedure and analysis 
Blank tests were conducted with liquids 
without the addition of any TFP to determine 
whether self-decomposition of ozone would 
occur in the aqueous solution in the presence or 
absence of UV.  Each blank test was conducted 
by filling with 8 L deionized water and adjusting 
the solution to the desired initial pH by adding a 
borate solution, and HCl or NaOH.  In the 
course of each experiment, liquid samples were 
periodically withdrawn from the reactor to 
analyze the dissolved ozone concentration in the 
reacting liquid.  At approximately the same 
time, ozone in the sample of the influent gas to 
or the exhaust gas from the liquid surface was 
trapped in a KI solution and its concentration 
determined iodometrically. 
In each TFP photolysis test, the reactor was 
 4
at four different temperatures of 26, 37, 48 and 
60 oC, respectively, with both UV254nm/O3 and 
UV185nm/O3 for a reaction time of 120 min.  
Figure 3 plots variations of RO3, SO3, RTFP and 
RTFP/RO3 with the temperature.  Figure 3(a) 
indicates that RO3 was found to increase with 
increasing temperature until 37 oC, and after that, 
it did not increase any further with the increasing 
temperature.  Figure 3(b) shows that SO3 
decreased with the increasing temperature and 
approached 0 at around 60 oC.  As Fig.3(c) 
indicates, there was no significant difference in 
RTFP with UV254nm/O3 and UV185nm/O3 under the 
four different reaction temperatures.  Raising 
reaction temperature did not affect RTFP because 
it enhanced the reaction rate constant and 
reduced the available OH?concentration 
responsible for the TFP degradation to nearly the 
same degree.  As shown in Fig. 3(d), RTFP/RO3 
was higher for the reaction at 26 oC than for 
those at other temperatures.  This suggests that 
UV/ozone degradation of TFP can best be done 
at ambient temperatures. 
Conclusions 
The experimental data concerning the 
UV254nm/O3 and UV185nm/O3 degradation of 
aqueous TFP in a batch reactor with initial 
concentrations of 772-887 mg/L support the 
following conclusions: 
1. Alkaline conditions accelerated TFP 
degradation and increased the mass of TFP 
decomposition per unit mass of ozone 
consumption, in both 254nm and 185nm of 
UV wavelength. 
2. A higher oxidation temperature in the range 
from 26 to 60 oC was found to be no help 
for UV254nm/O3 and UV185nm/O3 oxidation of 
TFP in the tested concentration range. 
3. The effect of UV wavelengths (254 nm and 
185 nm) was found to be insignificant for 
the TFP decomposition. 
4. With sufficient ozone application and an 
irradiated UV power intensity of 2.5 W/L to 
the reaction liquor, TFP exhibited 
zero-order degradation kinetics.
