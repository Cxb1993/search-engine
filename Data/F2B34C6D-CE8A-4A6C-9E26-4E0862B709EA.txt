variety of applications [1]. Furthermore, due to 
its high chemical and thermal stabilities, bR is 
considered the most promising nanobiomaterial 
for future applications. 
Due to the fact that the proton pump of bR is 
unidirectional across PM toward the 
extracellular side, a high orientation-degree of 
PM layers fabricated on devices is decidedly 
demanded to avoid the cancellation of 
photoelectric effects arising from opposite 
light-induced proton fluxes generated by 
counter-oriented PM layers. Among several 
ways to unidirectionally fabricate PM chips, the 
electrophoretic sedimentation technique has 
been acclaimed as the most convenient and 
effective and consequently the most widely used 
one. However, it still suffers the drawbacks of 
high PM-consumption and poor stability of the 
deposited PM films in aqueous electrolytes. 
Herein, we first demonstrate a novel 
immobilization of monolayer PM in either 
orientation onto substrates by the combination of 
affinity interaction, proteolytic digestion, and 
selective biotin-conjugation. Two different biotin 
derivatives, one specific for a unique 
extracellular (EC) amino acid of undigested PM 
and the other one for the cytoplasmic (CP) 
amino acids of digested PM, were selectively 
conjugated on EC and CP sides of PM, 
respectively. Subsequently, the two conjugated 
PM layers were each directionally immobilized 
onto a (strept)avidin-coated substrate. The 
selective biotin-conjugation on either side of PM 
also made the second biotinylation and 
consequently the sequent immobilization of the 
second (strept)avidin and then biotinylated PM 
possible, yielding a sandwich-type multilayer 
fabrication scheme. The monitoring of PM 
biotinylation and multilayer fabrication as well 
as the photocurrent and second harmonic 
generation (SHG) responses of the prepared 
PM-coated chips were reported. 
 
II. 實驗方法 
2.1 Materials 
PM was produced and purified in this 
laboratory following the standard procedures. 
Papain and biotin derivatives were purchased 
from Sigma and Pierce, respectively. 
(Strept)avidin was obtained from Invitrogen. 
 
2.2 PM biotinylation 
To prepare the PM conjugated with biotin 
at the EC side, named biotin(EC)-PM, 
undigested PM was reacted with biotin 
derivative A, followed by dialysis or 
centrifugation wash. To prepare the PM 
conjugated with biotin at the CP side, named 
biotin(CP)-PM, PM was first digested with 
papain, then reacted with another biotin 
derivative B, and finally centrifugation-washed.    
 
2.3 PM immobilization 
Amine-functionalized ITO glass or glass 
slides were incubated with glutaraldehyde, 
coated with (strept)avidin, and biotinylated PM 
in sequence. The PM-coating area is 0.77 cm2. 
For piezoelectric chips, gold-coated quartz 
crystals functionalized with amine-terminated 
long-chain thiols were used instead. 
 
2.4 Measurements 
Fig. 1 shows the equipment setup for 
measuring the photocurrents of PM-coated ITO 
chips. A platinum wire and a solution of 10 mM 
KCl at pH 8.5 were used as the counter 
electrode and the electrolyte, respectively. The 
cell was illuminated with a Xenon arc lamp at 
140 W equipped with a green-light filter and the 
 4
containing just one PM-coated chip (Fig. 7). The 
results suggested that the photocurrents of 
PM-coated chips are addable and that it is 
feasible to construct cells of high photocurrents 
by combining two electrodes fabricated with PM 
in opposite orientations. The decay rates of 
photocurrent responses from both combined 
cells were similar to that of the response from 
the ITO coated with biotin(EC)-PM, unlike the 
slow decay observed in the chip with 
biotin(CP)-PM, implying that the former chip, 
which generated higher current intensity than the 
latter one, dominated the responses of the 
combined cells. 
 
Finally, the effects of electrolyte pHs on 
the photoelectric behavior of both prepared 
native PM chips were investigated (Figs. 8 and 
9). There are a maximum of total photocurrents 
at pH 8.5 and a reversal of the current polarity 
between pH 5.75 and 6.0 for the chips coated 
with biotin(EC)-PM, while the maximum and 
polarity reversal of total photocurrents of the 
other chips coated with biotin(CP)-PM occurred 
at pH 7.5 and between pH 10 and 10.5, 
respectively (Fig. 8). Further investigation 
indicated that the photocurrent reversal of the 
latter chips under highly alkaline conditions 
arose from the intrinsic characteristics of ITO. In 
addition, asymmetry of peak photocurrents, i.e. 
inequality of the absolute values of light-on and 
light-off photocurrents, was observed at all 
responses of the latter chips and sometimes at 
extreme conditions for the former ones (Fig. 9). 
Those observations also provide us valuable 
information for future studies on the 
photoelectric mechanisms of the prepared chips. 
 
3.3 Sensor analysis of multilayer coating  
    Piezoelectric sensors are a sensitive 
label-free detector, where minute amounts of 
adsorbed analytes can be readily detected based 
on the linear relationship between the decreased 
resonant frequency of a piezoelectric quartz 
crystal and the mass deposited on its surface [2]. 
It has the advantages of direct detection, high 
sensitivity, fast response, real-time assay, low 
cost, automatic, and simple and easy operation, 
and has been widely used in biotechnology 
applications. Therefore, it is most suitable to 
detect the layer-by-layer coating of PM on a 
substrate. Fig. 10 shows the monitoring of 
unidirectional coating of multiple PM layers on 
quartz crystals. The decreased frequencies of the 
crystals, which are proportional to the loading 
mass, were linearly increased with increasing 
coating layers for both biotinylated PMs, 
suggesting the feasibility of layer-by-layer 
coating of PM through the combined strategy of 
side-selective biotinylation and biotin-(strept) 
avidin affinity immobilization proposed in this 
study. Regarding to the photocurrents of ITO 
coated with PM multilayers, no significant 
improvement of the signals than that of the 
single-layer chip was observed in a preliminary 
study. More investigations will be carried out in 
the future to tackle this issue. 
 
3.4 SHG analysis 
Finally, the SHG abilities of glass slides 
coated with both single and multiple layers of 
either biotinylated PM were preliminarily 
examined (Fig. 11 and Table 1). Due to the 
manual way to collect the data of each single 
measurement and the poor uniformity of PM 
coverage on avidin-coated slides, which had 
been observed by AFM analyses, high 
variations of the data were obtained for some 
cases. The overall results suggested that the 
SHG intensities of both chips depended on the

而被研究的生物體更是涵蓋範圍廣泛並具多樣性，展示了生物質能的相關技術與
研發成果及蓬勃的前景。 
 
此次會議的主題共有七大項：生質資源開發、生質化學品與材料、液態生質燃料、
生質燃氣與發電、生物平台技術、生質開發相關評估及其他等。在第一晚的歡迎
餐會後，第二天即進入全會講座 (plenary lectures)以及下午的壁報展示，晚上有
晚宴與壁報競賽頒獎，第三天則為分組的專題演講(keynote lectures)與一般的口
頭報告。於全會講座時有中國科學院院士閔恩澤博士介紹中國生質柴油產業的現
況與未來；加拿大Waterloo University M. Moo-Young教授介紹可再生生質燃料的
發展與生產時的挑戰；以及美國Michigan State University 的 Ramani Narayan 教
授介紹如何利用生質化學品與產品的開發來減少碳足跡及改善地球環境。此外，
還有中國工程院院士歐陽平凱博士介紹大陸的生質能現況；加拿大 University of 
Guelph 的 Amar K Mohanty教授介紹以生物煉製後之 lignin 殘渣所製作之奈米
結構複合材料及其在光電、過濾技術及各領域的應用；瑞典 Royal Institute of 
Technology and Malardalen University 的華裔 Jinyue Yan 教授介紹瑞典的生質能
之研發與利用現況。最後，則為美國 New Mexico State University 的 Vimal 
Chaitanya教授介紹海藻油的前景與展望。其中對 Ramani Narayan 教授與 Vimal 
Chaitanya 教授的演講印象最為深刻。前者提出對於每一物品的生產，其碳足跡
總量可分為材料碳足跡與製程碳足跡兩項來評估。就材料來比較，傳統石化材料
PE的碳足跡為 314 kg CO2/100 kg；反之，生物材料 Bio-PE/PLA 則因生產時有
固碳作用，因而其碳足跡為零，顯示發展生質化學品與材料對降低碳足跡與溫室
效應的重要性。Vimal Chaitanya教授則明確指出，由於發展藻油對糧食危機的衝
擊極微且其光合效率高、培養簡易又同時具有固碳效果，此外其同時具有可當動
物飼料與可生產高附加價值化學品之高經濟效益，因此在未來藻油將是生質油的
最大來源。在其領隊下，New Mexico State University受到其州政府及美國能源
部與農業部的強力支助，大規模地在田間發展海藻培養及藻油開發。最令人稱讚
的是，該大學為推展海藻培養及藻油的開發，於新墨西哥州內的每個角落都有部
屬單位，為當地的居民教育與解說，降低疑慮，提高民眾的瞭解程度與支持度。
此做法是值得我們學習的。 
 
於第三天的分組專題演講與一般的口頭報告中，對生質資源的開發還是以海藻為
大宗，其次為木質纖維素生質，如玉米桿與蘆葦桿等，還有其他植物來源，如葵
花子、綠珊瑚與大麻等，其中還有多位學者發表其對白蟻所進行的研究，探討其
對木質素作用之纖維水解酵素群及應用。此外，以生質所發展的化學品與材料則
玲瑯滿目，有生物塑膠、甘油、潤滑劑、環氧樹脂、接著劑、活性碳與其他等，
足見未來以生質取代石化原料生產化學品與材料的潛力。被研發的液態生質燃料
則有生質酒精、生質柴油、正丁醇與正烷等，其成效均顯示生物裂解法的可行性。
總體而言，與會者對於生質開發的相關評估均採取正面與樂觀的態度。
