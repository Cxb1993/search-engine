little influence on the impedance-matching 
bandwidth and the omnidirectional antenna 
patterns of an internal linear dipole antenna. 
 
                                                                                                          
2. Design Objectives and Procedure 
 
The design objectives for an FSSE are: 
high transmittance at the specified wireless 
signal band, high SE outside this band, no 
effect on the antenna patterns of the internal 
antenna, and no influence on the 
impedance-matching bandwidth of this 
antenna. The configuration of an FSSE is 
shown in Fig. 1. The top and bottom faces 
are created by periodically printing a 
bandpass element, a square metal element 
with four connecting branches (as shown in 
Fig. 1(a)), on a dielectric substrate. The four 
side faces use the same substrate entirely 
printed with metal.  
The design for a specified FSSE can be 
fulfilled by following a clear procedure:  (i) 
design the top and bottom faces to have a 
bandpass characteristic according to the 
specification; (ii) integrate the top and 
bottom faces designed in step (i) and four 
side faces entirely printed with metal into a 
FSSE, as shown in Fig. 1(b); (iii) finely tune 
the enclosure dimensions and the element 
geometrical parameters to achieve the design 
objectives. 
 
 
3. Experimental Results and Discussion 
 
A prototype of a FSSE is created, 
simulated, measured, and studied. The FSSE 
is specified for a UMTS mobile PDA/phone. 
The six faces are fabricated by printing metal 
on an FR4 substrate with a thickness of 1.6 
mm and with a dielectric constant of 4.4. In 
particular, the top and bottom faces are 
printed with 5 3× elements. The final 
enclosure dimensions and element 
geometrical parameters are shown in Fig. 1. 
To simulate the performance of the FSSE, a 
3D finite-element method full-wave 
simulator, HFSS, is used.  
Figs. 2 and 3 show the SE and 
transmittance of the FSSE, respectively. Fig. 
2 shows the global information of the FSSE, 
while Fig. 3 details the local information at 
the UMTS band. The configuration of the 
measurement setup is shown in Fig. 4. A 
half-wavelength linear dipole antenna is 
located in the center of the FSSE and another
dipole antenna is located outside the FSSE in 
the far-field region. Both antennas are 
collinear and parallel to the y-axis. Here, the 
SE is defined as 
i
10 t
ESE 20log (dB)
E
=   (1) 
where iE  and tE  are the electric fields 
observed at the receiving antenna without 
and with the FSSE present, respectively. In 
addition, the transmittance is written as 
t
i
ETransmittance 100 (%)
E
= × . (2) 
Both the measured and simulated results in 
Figs. 2 and 3 show the high transmittance 
characteristic at the UMTS band and the high 
SE outside this band.  
Two additional issues should be paid 
attention to, i.e., whether the 
impedance-matching bandwidth and the 
omnidirectional antenna patterns of the 
internal linear dipole antenna are preserved 
when the FSSE is in use. Fig. 5 shows the 
measured return loss of the internal antenna 
with the FSSE present or absent. The results 
indeed demonstrate that the 
impedance-matching bandwidth (determined 
by -10 dB return loss) is only slightly 
affected when the FSSE is present. Figs. 6(a) 
and 6(b) show the measured E-plane and 
H-plane antenna patterns of the linear dipole 
antenna, respectively. The results show little 
difference between the cases with and 
without the FSSE in use. The maximum 
reduction of the gain occurs in the end-fire 
direction (x-direction). It is due to that the 
thickness of the FSSE, required by practical 
applications, may be limited and cannot even 
comprise an element on the side faces. 
Except this inevitable sacrifice, the results 
shown above demonstrate the achievement of 
the FSSE design objectives.
