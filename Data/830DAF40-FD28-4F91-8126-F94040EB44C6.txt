Abstract—In this study, we consider an optimization problem
concerning about how to build a multicast tree to deliver
continuous multimedia streams to a large number of mesh clients
on the wireless mesh networks simultaneously. In order to provide
high-quality streams to users, we need to allocate non-overlapping
channels to communication links to avoid interference. Since the
number of non-overlapping channels is very limited, some links
may not have channels allocated, and the resulting multicast
tree may cover only a subset of subscribers. Since the more
subscribers can be serviced, the more proﬁts we can make. The
goal of this research is then set to determine a multicast tree that
can maximize the number of serviced subscribers. An algorithm
named LCMR is proposed for the problem described above.
The experimental results show that the partial multicast tree
determined by our LCMR method outperforms the trees found
by the previous published approaches.

I. INTRODUCTION
IEEE 802.11 based wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with
directional antennas are expected to be a new promising
technology for providing wireless broadband services in rural
areas [1]–[]. The backbone of a rural mesh network consists
of a number of mesh routers (MRs) and long-distance point-
to-point wireless links, where each MR is equipped with high-
gain directional antennas for establishing connections over a
distance of several 10s of kilometers. Additionally, one of
mesh routers operates as the gateway node for other MRs
to access Internet by multiple-hop communications. The end-
users serviced by MRs are called mesh clients. They connect
to WMNs through base stations built on MRs [4].
It is well known that the performances of multihop wireless
networks are greatly affected by interferences between links
with overlapping channels in vicinity areas. In general, there
are two techniques: interference-free channel assignment and
directional antennas, used in rural mesh networks to improve
performances. With frequency separation from orthogonal
channels and spatial separation from directional antennas,
transmission contentions between nearby links can be signiﬁ-
cantly reduced so as to increase network throughput.
With directional antenna designed to transmit and receive
signals in a speciﬁc direction, there are two phenomena:
near ﬁeld effect and side-lobe radiation, cause interferences
occurred between adjacent links of a node [2]. Because of the
near ﬁeld effect, simultaneous transmissions and receptions
on the same node are not possible unless non-overlapping
channels are used. As for the side-lobe radiation, adjacent
directional links allocated with the same channel from the
same node must have a minimum angular separation to trans-
mit signals without interferences. As a result, the number
of connected nodes of a MR is bounded. Hence, in order
to enhance performances and avoid interferences, distinct
non-overlapping channels are required to be assigned to the
directed outgoing links of a node for our multicast problem
which will be studied and described later. Also, based on
the studies in [5], [6], links without common end-nodes will
not interfere with each other if the directional antennas are
adjusted properly. On the other hand, for the recent research
works on multicast routing in WMNs with omnidirectional
antennas, their approaches usually take advantages of the
nature of wireless broadcast by allocating the same frequency
channel to the outgoing links from the same node [7], [8].
In this paper, we consider a scenario as shown in Fig. 1
that a multimedia delivering system is deployed on a WMN in
which a video server is assumed to be attached to the gateway
node. The mesh clients may like to receive a video stream from
the video server at the same time. For example, a large amount
of users may subscribe simultaneously for watching the MLB
game in live on the Internet. For multimedia applications
involved in real-time communications described as above, the
multicast technology would be more appropriate than unicast
for efﬁciently delivering continuous streams to a large amount
of mesh clients. To provide high-quality bandwidths for the
real-time transmissions, we need to establish an interference-
free multicast tree in which the tree edges are allocated with
non-overlapping channels as discussed above.
Unfortunately, the number of non-overlapping channels is
very limited. For instance, only  out of 11 channels in
802.11b/g are not overlapped, and they are channel 1, 6, 11
[12]. As a result, we may have a situation that some links
may not have channels allocated, and some end-users do not
receive the video streams that they have subscribed. That

V. INTERFERENCE-FREE MULTICAST TREE
We propose the LCMR algorithm in this section to deter-
mine an optimal MRCM tree Tmrcm on WMNs. The basic
idea of LCMR is to take into accounts both interference
factor and the number of subscribers at the same time during
the formation of the multicast routing tree. The algorithm is
presented in Fig. 4.
The ﬁrst step of our LCMR method is to construct an
interference-aware minimum spanning tree (IMST) using a
modiﬁed Prim’s algorithm. For each link eu,v in IMST, its
corresponding interference set is constructed based on all the
ingoing and outgoing links attached to nodes u and v. With
the help of these interference sets, we can construct an IMST
as shown at step 4 in Fig. 4. A multicast tree Tmt is then
determined at step 5 based on IMST by recursively removing
the leaf-nodes which are not in M set.
Since the number of non-overlapping channels is limited, it
is very likely that some nodes in Tmt may not have enough
orthogonal channels to be assigned to the links attached
to them. As a result, the links which can lead to a large
amounts of serviced subscribers should have higher priority
to obtain the non-overlapping channels. To implement such an
observation, a load(u) value is deﬁned at step 6 for each node
u to indicate the number of subscribers that can be serviced
for a subtree rooted at u. A depth-ﬁrst-search (DFS) based
postorder traversal procedure is then executed on Tmt to obtain
Input: A WMN network G(V,E) with a gateway node s, and
a set M = {u|u ∈ V,REQ(u) > 0)}, where REQ(u) is the
number of subscribers serviced by node u.
1) Compute the interference set I-set for each link eu,v,
where I(eu,v) = {w|(u,w) ∈ E�(v, w) ∈ E}.
2) Let V¯ = {s}, E¯ = φ, W¯ = {eu,v|u ∈ V¯ , v /∈ V¯ and
v ∈ V }. A best link is selected from W¯ based on the
following procedure:
(a) Let L = {eu,v|eu,v with the smallest size of inter-
ference set, i.e. minimum of �I(eu,v)�}.
(b) Select eu,v from L, where v is the node with the
maximum value of REQ(v).
) V¯ = V¯ ∪ {v}, E¯ = E¯ ∪ {eu,v}.
4) Loop back to step 2 until V¯ = V . An interference-aware
minimum spanning tree Timst is formed.
5) Recursively remove the leaf nodes which are not in M
to produce the multicast tree Tmt.
6) Let load(u)=
�
v∈Tu
REQ(v), where Tu is a subtree
rooted at u. A DFS-based post-order traversal is exe-
cuted on the multicast tree Tmt to compute load(u) for
each node u.
7) A MRCM tree Tmrcm is obtained by executing the
procedure presented in Fig. 5 on Tmt.
8) Compute gain = �
u∈M
REQ(u).
Output: A MRCM tree Tmrcm associated with its gain
Fig. 4. The LCMR algorithm
a node-weighted multicast tree Tmt, where a load(u) value is
stored at each node u.
Starting from the gateway s (root node), a breadth-ﬁrst-
search (BFS) based channel-assignment procedure presented
in Fig. 5 is used to assign non-overlapping channels to links
at each level. A link ew,u ∈ Tmt with large load(u) value has
higher priority to be assigned a non-overlapping channel. Since
the number of non-overlapping channels is very limited, there
are links that do not have channels allocated. These links are
deleted from Tmt. The output from Fig. 5 is a multicast tree
that may only cover a subset of multicast nodes in M . This
tree is the desired MRCM tree Tmrcm, which should generate
the maximal value of gain.
The time complexity of our LCMR algorithm is analyzed as
follows. In Fig. 4, step 1 takes O(�E�∗�V �) to compute I-set,
while the loop in step 2 to step 4 takes O(�V � ∗ �E�) to ﬁnd
minimum spanning tree Timst. As for the procedure in Fig. 5,
it is bounded by the link-sorting procedure at step  which
takes O(�E�log�E�) time. Overall, our LCMR algorithm
takes O(�E� ∗ �V �) time at the worst case.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we have several sets of experiments to do
performance comparisons for multicast trees generated by the
LCMR, MCM [8], Kou [1] and SPT (Shortest Path Tree)
[10] algorithms. The MCM algorithm proposed by Zeng et
al. builds multicast trees by minimizing the number of relay

under different number of non-overlapping channels for 100-
node networks with 50% nodes participate in multicasting. The
experimental results show that our LCMR is a stable method
which consistently outperforms the other three algorithms in
terms of the values of ”performance ratio”, when the number
of non-overlapping channels is varied from  to 5.
C. Executing efﬁciency
A set of experiments for comparing the efﬁciency of our
LCMR heuristic against Kou, MCM, SPT algorithms is pre-
sented in this subsection. In Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, different
sizes of networks and multicast groups are shown at x-
axis respectively, while the total execution time required for

channels is varied from  to 5

running 100 different random networks is shown at y-axis on
a logarithmic scale. Results in Fig. 10 show that the SPT
method is very efﬁcient at the expense of its performance,
while our LCMR has comparable efﬁcient as MCM without
sacriﬁcing the performance. In particular, LCMR takes less
than 0.1 second for solving a benchmark with 100 nodes. As
for the results shown in Fig. 11, it indicates that the executing
time required by LCMR does not depend on the size of a
multicast group in a 100-node network. In fact, only network
size affects the efﬁciency of our LCMR method.
D. Impact of tree topology
Based on 50-node random networks with various numbers
of receivers, the multi-radio constrained multicast trees gen-
erated by LCMR, Kou, MCM, SPT algorithms may be very
different. In order to observe the effects of tree topologies
in multicasting, a set of simulations based on NS-2 simulator
[15] is designed in this subsection for comparing these MRCM
trees on which a tree-based routing protocol MAODV is im-
plemented [14]. Three metrics: end-to-end delay, throughput,

V. INTERFERENCE-FREE MULTICAST TREE
We propose the LCMR algorithm in this section to deter-
mine an optimal MRCM tree Tmrcm on WMNs. The basic
idea of LCMR is to take into accounts both interference
factor and the number of subscribers at the same time during
the formation of the multicast routing tree. The algorithm is
presented in Fig. 4.
The first step of our LCMR method is to construct an
interference-aware minimum spanning tree (IMST) using a
modified Prim’s algorithm. For each link eu,v in IMST, its
corresponding interference set is constructed based on all the
ingoing and outgoing links attached to nodes u and v. With
the help of these interference sets, we can construct an IMST
as shown at step 4 in Fig. 4. A multicast tree Tmt is then
determined at step 5 based on IMST by recursively removing
the leaf-nodes which are not in M set.
Since the number of non-overlapping channels is limited, it
is very likely that some nodes in Tmt may not have enough
orthogonal channels to be assigned to the links attached
to them. As a result, the links which can lead to a large
amounts of serviced subscribers should have higher priority
to obtain the non-overlapping channels. To implement such an
observation, a load(u) value is defined at step 6 for each node
u to indicate the number of subscribers that can be serviced
for a subtree rooted at u. A depth-first-search (DFS) based
postorder traversal procedure is then executed on Tmt to obtain
Input: A WMN network G(V,E) with a gateway node s, and
a set M = {u|u ∈ V,REQ(u) > 0)}, where REQ(u) is the
number of subscribers serviced by node u.
1) Compute the interference set I-set for each link eu,v,
where I(eu,v) = {w|(u,w) ∈ E‖(v, w) ∈ E}.
2) Let V¯ = {s}, E¯ = φ, W¯ = {eu,v|u ∈ V¯ , v /∈ V¯ and
v ∈ V }. A best link is selected from W¯ based on the
following procedure:
(a) Let L = {eu,v|eu,v with the smallest size of inter-
ference set, i.e. minimum of ‖I(eu,v)‖}.
(b) Select eu,v from L, where v is the node with the
maximum value of REQ(v).
3) V¯ = V¯ ∪ {v}, E¯ = E¯ ∪ {eu,v}.
4) Loop back to step 2 until V¯ = V . An interference-aware
minimum spanning tree Timst is formed.
5) Recursively remove the leaf nodes which are not in M
to produce the multicast tree Tmt.
6) Let load(u)= ∑
v∈Tu
REQ(v), where Tu is a subtree
rooted at u. A DFS-based post-order traversal is exe-
cuted on the multicast tree Tmt to compute load(u) for
each node u.
7) A MRCM tree Tmrcm is obtained by executing the
procedure presented in Fig. 5 on Tmt.
8) Compute gain = ∑
u∈M
REQ(u).
Output: A MRCM tree Tmrcm associated with its gain
Fig. 4. The LCMR algorithm
a node-weighted multicast tree Tmt, where a load(u) value is
stored at each node u.
Starting from the gateway s (root node), a breadth-first-
search (BFS) based channel-assignment procedure presented
in Fig. 5 is used to assign non-overlapping channels to links
at each level. A link ew,u ∈ Tmt with large load(u) value has
higher priority to be assigned a non-overlapping channel. Since
the number of non-overlapping channels is very limited, there
are links that do not have channels allocated. These links are
deleted from Tmt. The output from Fig. 5 is a multicast tree
that may only cover a subset of multicast nodes in M . This
tree is the desired MRCM tree Tmrcm, which should generate
the maximal value of gain.
The time complexity of our LCMR algorithm is analyzed as
follows. In Fig. 4, step 1 takes O(‖E‖∗‖V ‖) to compute I-set,
while the loop in step 2 to step 4 takes O(‖V ‖ ∗ ‖E‖) to find
minimum spanning tree Timst. As for the procedure in Fig. 5,
it is bounded by the link-sorting procedure at step 3 which
takes O(‖E‖log‖E‖) time. Overall, our LCMR algorithm
takes O(‖E‖ ∗ ‖V ‖) time at the worst case.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we have several sets of experiments to do
performance comparisons for multicast trees generated by the
LCMR, MCM [8], Kou [13] and SPT (Shortest Path Tree)
[10] algorithms. The MCM algorithm proposed by Zeng et
al. builds multicast trees by minimizing the number of relay

multicasting
Fig. 8. Performance comparisons when 10% of nodes participate in

under different number of non-overlapping channels for 100-
node networks with 50% nodes participate in multicasting. The
experimental results show that our LCMR is a stable method
which consistently outperforms the other three algorithms in
terms of the values of ”performance ratio”, when the number
of non-overlapping channels is varied from 3 to 5.
C. Executing efficiency
A set of experiments for comparing the efficiency of our
LCMR heuristic against Kou, MCM, SPT algorithms is pre-
sented in this subsection. In Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, different
sizes of networks and multicast groups are shown at x-
axis respectively, while the total execution time required for
Fig. 9. Performance comparisons when the number of non-overlapping
channels is varied from 3 to 5
Fig. 10. Efficiency comparisons set I
running 100 different random networks is shown at y-axis on
a logarithmic scale. Results in Fig. 10 show that the SPT
method is very efficient at the expense of its performance,
while our LCMR has comparable efficient as MCM without
sacrificing the performance. In particular, LCMR takes less
than 0.1 second for solving a benchmark with 100 nodes. As
for the results shown in Fig. 11, it indicates that the executing
time required by LCMR does not depend on the size of a
multicast group in a 100-node network. In fact, only network
size affects the efficiency of our LCMR method.
D. Impact of tree topology
Based on 50-node random networks with various numbers
of receivers, the multi-radio constrained multicast trees gen-
erated by LCMR, Kou, MCM, SPT algorithms may be very
different. In order to observe the effects of tree topologies
in multicasting, a set of simulations based on NS-2 simulator
[15] is designed in this subsection for comparing these MRCM
trees on which a tree-based routing protocol MAODV is im-
plemented [14]. Three metrics: end-to-end delay, throughput,
