  
From a medical point of view, the synthesis 
information on the same image can provide more 
assistance in the clinical diagnosis, evaluation, and 
operation. Therefore, image fusion can be a good 
auxiliary to help the physicians in localizing the 
same region of interest from different modalities 
of a single patient. 
The most important step in a successful 
image fusion is registration. Different images have 
their particular coordinates, which can be access 
through photographic machines. The registration 
procedure (or called co-registration, matching), 
uses a transformed matrix to locate each source 
image on the same spatial coordinate. The 
registration procedure must be accurate enough to 
limit the amount of imprecision introduced. A 
meaningful image fusion is built on an accurate 
registration.  
In the clinical application of Parkinson’s 
disease (PD), some anatomical imaging such as 
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) are of limited help. But 
functional imaging techniques such as positron 
emission tomography (PET) or single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide 
the means for detecting in vivo metabolic and 
neuro-chemical changes characteristic of PD 
pathology. In the application of PD’s diagnosis, 
SPECT has already provided important 
contributions to the diagnosis and gives us a better 
understanding of the pathophysiology of PD and 
related syndromes. 
 In this approach, we have proposed a new 
scheme for registration of MRI and SPECT. 
Relying on image decomposition by fuzzy 
c-means and image blurring by convolution with 
the Gaussian function, MRI can simulate the 
radiation of SPECT to increase the performance of 
registration. In addition, the performance of the 
eight similarity measures used in our registration 
scheme is also included.   
 
II. The proposed method 
 
The whole flowchart of the proposed 
registration method is illustrated in Fig. 1. In 
short, there are three steps in this scheme, 
including image decomposition by fuzzy c-means 
(FCM), convolution with Gaussian function, and 
registration by a similarity measure function. 
More specifically, FCM algorithm can decompose 
MRI into some different fuzzy maps including 
background, brain tissue, and noise. A brain tissue 
map, which performs convolution with Gaussian 
function, can be simulated like a SPECT image 
with radiation. Finally, MRI-SPECT registration 
is carried out by optimizing a similarity measure. 
The final result is the best coordinate 
transformation for registration.   
 
A. Image decomposition by FCM 
 
FCM is often used for image segmentation 
problem and has fine results [1-2]. It is a 
completely unsupervised method and convergence 
repeatedly, in order to find the optimum solution. 
The FCM algorithm, via fuzzy pixel classification, 
allows pixels belong to multiple classes with 
varying degrees of membership. The FCM 
algorithm for scalar data seeks the membership 
function uk(i,j) (Eq. (1)) and the centroids vk (Eq. 
(2)), such that the objective function shown as Eq. 
(3) is minimized.

Where uk(i,j) is the membership value of the 
pixel (i,j) in the k-th class, vk is the centroid of 
k-th class, and q is a weighting exponent on each 
fuzzy membership and it determines the amount of 
“fuzziness” of the resulting classification. By 
calculating Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) repeatedly, the 
objective value JFCM is converged on a static 
minimum by the way of the expectably accuracy 
with a preset threshold value. When the variation 
of JFCM is smaller than this threshold value, the 
process is terminated and the last uk(i,j) and vk are 
then used as the constraint parameters for 
segmentation. 
Figure 2 shows how the FCM decomposes a MRI 
image into three fuzzy maps. In this experiment, 
the cluster number of FCM is three. The 
corresponding fuzzy maps individually in Figure 2 
are (a) background, (b) low intensity (skin, white 
matter and gray matter), and (c) high intensity 
(cerebrospinal fluid). 
                                                        
  
 
III. Experimental results 
  
In the experiment, test images are selected 
from a database of Parkinson’s Disease patients. 
Five cases are used, one is normal and the others 
are Parkinson’s Disease patients diagnosed by 
neuropsychological evaluation. Each person has a 
MRI imaging series and the corresponding SPECT 
imaging series. 
The MRI images in this experiment are 
T2-weighted images with a TR of 4000 ms and TE 
of 90 ms. The images’ slice thickness is 3 mm. 
The data series was obtained from axial view and 
has approximately 50 images. The image’s matrix 
size was 256×256 pixels and resolution was 
0.78×0.78 mm2. SPECT images are Tc-99m 
labeled tropanes of TRODAT, 128×128×64 
voxels, and each voxel is a 2.9 mm3 cubic. Before 
MRI/SPECT registration, the SPECT images are 
reconstructed as the resolution of MRI by 
tri-linear interpolation. 
In the following experiments, MRI imaging 
is the reference data set, and SPECT imaging is 
the data set to be overlapped. In the other words, 
SPECT is registered on MRI by a spatial 
transformation. Because we did not have the exact 
solution or the golden standard of the 
MRI-SPECT registration, six evaluation functions 
were used to evaluate the performance of 
registration from three different view points.  
First, we compared the overlapped data 
volumes using Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) to find how 
much of the volume is matched, and how much is 
mismatched. VMRI means the volume of MRI, 
while VSPECT means the volume of SPECT. Where 
 is exclusive-OR operator.  ⊕
Second, we compared two data set surfaces 
to see if they were close together or separated. 
Assume two data sets of surface points are 
and . 
After performing image registration, the 
transformed SPECT point set, i.e.,  
, is obtained, where q’
{ }mpppMRI ,...,, 21= { nqqqSPECT ,...,, 21= }
}{ mqqqSPECT ',...,','' 21= i is 
the closest point to pi in SPECT’. Therefore, the 
average surface shift can be calculated by Eq. (7). 
Finally, three affined invariants including 
area, long-axis, and short-axis are employed to 
calculate error functions of both slice set of joint 
object. The three error functions of area, long-axis 
and short-axis are listed in Eq. (8)-(10), where S is 
the total slice number of joint object, si is the slice 
sequence of image sets MRI and SPECT, max() 
denotes the maximum value of whole image set, 
and area(), long(), and short() represent values of 
area, long-axis, and short-axis, respectively.

 Table 1 is the results compared with four 
registration criteria. M4, following the scheme 
proposed in this research, means registration with 
image decomposition and blurring. M3 means 
registration with image blurring without image 
decomposition. M2 is the opposite of M3. And 
M1 is without image decomposition and blurring. 
All of the values in the tables are the average of 
measuring with eight similarity measures of five 
individual people. The bold numbers represent the 
best result for a special evaluation function. 
Obviously, M4 has the best performance 
especially in three error functions. In other words, 
the method proposed is more suitable for the 
MRI-SPECT registration task.   
In order to figure out which similarity 
measure is the most suitable in performing 
MRI-SPECT registration, we compared these 
eight similarity measures by scoring. In table 2, 
the value in each field is the average of five 
individual data sets performing registration 
following the scheme as Figure1. The best result 
in each evaluated criterion has 8 points, the 
second one has 7 points, and the worst has 1 
point, etc. It is observed that table 2 shows PI, 
NCC and GC are the best similarity measures in 
MRI-SPECT registration, and MSD is the worst.
