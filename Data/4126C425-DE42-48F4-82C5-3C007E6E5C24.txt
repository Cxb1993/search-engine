Abstract 
Tool size effects on microstructures and failure modes of friction stir spot welds (FSSW) 
in lap-shear specimens of aluminum 6061-T6 sheets were investigated based on experimental 
observations.  Based on the tool dimensions given in the literatures, a design rule for the tool 
dimension was developed.  Three tools with different dimensions, T1, T2 and T3, were made 
based on our design rule.  The optimum processing parameters for FSSWs made by the three 
tools were obtained by the design of experiments (DOE).  Based on experimental results, the 
optimum processing parameters of these FSSWs are very similar to each other and their 
strengths appear to be linearly proportional to the tool dimensions.  Micrographs of these 
FSSWs show that the nugget diameters appear to be directly proportional to the failure 
strengths.  The failure modes of these FSSWs show the nugget pullout or mix failure mode.  
Scanning electron micrographs of the failed FSSWs show large amount of dimples on the 
fracture surfaces of the initial failure points which indicates the necking/shear failure.

3-1.2攪拌刀具 T2之適焊參數 
 
從攪拌刀具 T1建立適焊參數的經驗，初始參數設定為(1)攪拌刀具轉速 700、1350、
2000 rpm，(2)進给深度 1.7、1.8、1.9 mm，以攪拌探針接觸試片表面為零點，(3)停留時
間為 0、7、14 sec.，(4)進给速率為 0.2 mm/s，各組參數重複實驗 4次。從第一次分析結
果中可觀察到焊接參數為轉速 700 rpm左右、進给深度在 1.8 mm至 1.9 mm之間、停留
時間在 7 sec.至 14 sec.時，可以得到較佳的焊點。在經過二次重覆性分析後，最後得到
適焊參數為轉速 700 rpm，進给深度 1.8 mm，停留時間 7 sec.(表 3-2)。 
 
3-1.3攪拌刀具 T3之適焊參數 
 
參考攪拌刀具 T2 建立適焊參數的經驗，初始參數設定為(1)攪拌刀具轉速 700、
1350、2000 rpm，(2)進给深度 1.7、1.8、1.9 mm，以攪拌探針接觸試片表面為零點，(3)
停留時間為 0、7、14 sec.，(4)進给速率為 0.2 mm/s，各組參數重複實驗 4次。從第一次
分析結果中可觀察到焊接參數為轉速 700 rpm至 1350 rpm間、進给深度在 1.8至 1.9 mm
之間、停留時間在 7 sec.至 14 sec.時，可以得到較佳的焊點。在經過二次重覆分析後，
最後得到適焊參數為轉速 700rpm，進给深度 1.8 mm，停留時間 7 sec. (表 3-3)。 
 
3-1.4實驗歸納 
 
本研究利用實驗設計法分別取得攪拌刀具 T1至 T3的適焊參數組。三支刀具的最大
拉伸強度分別為 2816±61 N、3376±25 N及 4062±66 N如圖 3-1所示。這三支刀具在尺
寸上，除了探針長度一致之外，其肩部及探針直徑皆依一定的比例設計。從上面的敍述
可知，三者的適焊參數彼此相當近似，且最大拉伸強度隨尺寸的增加呈近乎於線性的變
化，這項成果可以成為未來刀具設計的參考準則。 
 
3-2金相試驗 
 
圖 3-2(a)是試片經剪切拉伸試驗前的橫斷面圖，圖 3-2(b)為圖 3-2(a)中的區域 I、II、
III以及 IV放大圖。圖中焊點採用攪拌刀具 T1製成，焊接參數為(1)轉速 700 rpm，(2)
進给深度 1.8 mm，(3)停留時間 9 sec.。如圖 3-2(a)所示，橫斷面上可以看到一個凹陷的
輪廓，此為攪拌刀具探針及肩部的幾何外形。靠近中心凹孔的兩側為攪拌區(stir zone)。
在刀具肩部凹痕下方有一弧形的交界線，交界線左右對稱由刀具肩部凹痕的外緣起始，
向下逐漸內縮最後消失在凹孔底部，外觀近似碗形。在交界線內側區域相對於母材其顏
色偏暗，這區域是熱機響區(TMAZ)。在交界線外側僅受摩擦熱影響而未受到刀具攪拌
與擠壓的區域是熱影響區(HAZ)，此區域與母材的金相有時很難區別。由於攪拌刀具 T1
的探針上光滑無螺紋，故攪拌區的範圍較小且不明顯，反而是熱機影響區的範圍較大且
結構明顯。值得注意的是，這三個區域的大小及形狀受刀具形狀及焊接參數的影響極大。 
如圖 3-2(a)所示，上下試片未焊接處的介面在焊點外圍自然形成兩道縫隙，延伸到
熱機影響區附近時，縫隙受高溫高壓的攪拌及擠壓被扭曲成兩道丘陵狀弧線，最後消失
在熱機影響區內。受刀具肩部下壓和摩擦的作用，部分上試片的材料被擠壓至肩部外，
同時也推擠部份上試片材料沿著肩部壓痕外緣向外延伸，造成壓痕下方上試片的厚度減
小。然而，受附近材料的限制，使上試片沿著壓痕外緣產生少許彎曲現象，造成上下試
片的間隙。一部份受刀具肩部擠壓出來的上試片材料會堆積在上試片表面形成一環狀隆
起，分布在肩部壓痕外圍。值得注意的是，Murr 及 Boz 等人[6,7]研究指出，鋁合金電

Types of Loading Conditions

ABSTRACT 
The theoretical framework and closed-form stress 
intensity factor solutions in terms of the structural 
stresses for spot welds under various types of loading 
conditions are presented based on elasticity theories 
and fracture mechanics.  A mechanics description of 
loading conditions for a finite plate with a rigid inclusion 
is first presented.  The loading conditions of interest are 
the resultant loads on the inclusion in a plate and the 
surface tractions on the lateral surface of a plate.  The 
surface tractions on the lateral surface of the plate can 
be decomposed into a load-balanced part and a self-
balanced part.  The resultant loads on the inclusion and 
the self-balanced resultant loads on the lateral surface 
are then decomposed into various types of symmetric 
and anti-symmetric parts.  Based on the elasticity 
theories, closed-form moment, force and stress solutions 
are derived for a plate with a rigid inclusion subjected to 
various types of loading conditions.  Based on the J  
integral for a strip model, closed-form analytical stress 
intensity factor solutions for spot welds joining two 
sheets of equal thickness are derived in terms of the 
structural stresses around a rigid inclusion in a plate 
under various types of loading conditions.  The closed-
form solutions presented in this paper are used as the 
basis to develop new analytical stress intensity factor 
solutions for spot welds in various types of specimens 
presented in a subsequent paper. 
INTRODUCTION 
Resistance spot welding is widely used to join sheet 
metals in the automotive industry.  These spot welds are 
subjected to complex multiaxial loads under service or 
crash conditions.  The fatigue lives of spot welds in 
various types of specimens have been investigated by 
many researchers, for example, see Zhang [1].  Since a 
spot weld provides a natural crack or notch along the 
nugget circumference, fracture mechanics has been 
adopted to investigate the stress intensity factors at the 
critical locations of spot welds in order to investigate the 
fatigue lives of spot welds in various type of specimens 
[1-14]. 
Pook [2] indicated that for a class of transversely loaded 
configurations consisting of two thin plates or beams 
joined over part of their common plane under symmetric 
loading conditions, the energy release rate or the stress 
intensity factor at a crack tip depends on the bending 
moment acting to the beam or plate in the vicinity of the 
crack tip.  Wang et al. [12] conducted a three-
dimensional finite element analysis of circular plates with 
connection under opening loading conditions.  The 
computational results indicate that the stress intensity 
factor along the crack front can be correlated very well 
with the analytical solutions based on the bending 
moments or the corresponding structural stresses for 
thin plates with connection.  Wang et al. [13] conducted 
a three-dimensional finite element analysis of a nearly 
square large lap-shear specimen.  The computational 
results indicated that the stress intensity factor at the 
critical locations agrees very well with the analytical 
solution based on the bending moments and the 
membrane forces or the corresponding structural 
stresses.  The results of Wang et al. [12,13] suggest that 
using the bending moments and the membrane forces or 
the corresponding structural stresses to obtain the stress 
intensity factors for spot welds assumed as rigid 
inclusions in thin plates can be quite accurate. 
The closed-form solutions for thin plates with rigid 
inclusions under shear, central bending, counter bending, 
and opening loading conditions were obtained by 
Muskhelishvili [15], Reiβner [16], Goland [17], 
Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger [18], and Lin et al. 
[14], respectively.  These solutions except those of 
Goland [17] and Lin et al. [14] were used by Zhang 
[1,10,11] to obtain the structural stresses at several 
critical locations of spot welds in various types of 
specimens and automotive structures, where the spot 
welds were treated as rigid in the analytical or numerical

STRESS INTENSITY FACTOR SOLUTIONS FOR 
A STRIP MODEL UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF 
LOADING CONDITIONS 
Once the moments, transverse shear forces and 
structural stresses along the rigid inclusion 
circumference are determined from a plate with a rigid 
inclusion under various types of the loading conditions, 
the strip model of Radaj and Zhang [5] can then be 
adopted to derive approximate stress intensity factor 
solutions for spot welds under various types of loading 
conditions.  The stress intensity factors can then be 
determined from the structural stress distributions and 
the J  integral based on the strip model. 
In reference to Figure 4, the J  integral is defined as 
∫ ∂∂−= dsxuTWnJ iix )(Γ , zyxi ,,=  (14) 
where the strain energy density W  is defined as 
∫= ij ijijdW ε εσ0  ( zyxji ,,, = ) (15) 
For linear elastic materials, the J  integral represents the 
energy release rate [26].  Under plane strain conditions, 
the J  integral is related to IK , IIK  and IIIK  as

Based on the works of Radaj [4] and Radaj and Zhang 
[5], general structural stress distributions for a strip 
model can be decomposed into several symmetric and 
anti-symmetric distributions.  Figure 5 schematically 
shows the decomposition of the general structural stress 
distributions of a strip model.  Schematics of various 
types of structural stress distributions are shown from 
model A to G in Figure 5.  The general structural stress 
distributions are shown as model A.  As schematically 
shown in model A, the radial stress rrσ  and the shear 
stress θσ r  along the rigid inclusion circumference 
obtained from a plate with a rigid inclusion under various 
types of loading conditions are used to represent the 
structural stresses xσ  and xzτ , respectively.  The 
structural stress distributions of model A are then 
decomposed into several symmetric or anti-symmetric 
types of structural stress distributions: symmetric 
counter bending (model B), anti-symmetric central 
bending (model C), symmetric tension/compression 
(model D), anti-symmetric in-plane shear (model E), 
symmetric out-of-plane shear (model F) and anti-
symmetric out-of-plane shear (model G).  Note that the 
normal stresses uiσ , uoσ , liσ  and loσ  represent the 
normal stresses xσ  at the inner (i) and outer (o) 
surfaces of the upper (u) and lower (l) strips, 
respectively.  The shear stresses uτ  and lτ  represent 
the shear stress xzτ  of the upper (u) and lower (l) strips, 
respectively.  The maximum values of the normal stress 
xσ , marked as CBσ  for counter bending (model B), Bσ  
for central bending (model C), Tσ  for 
tension/compression (model E) and Sσ  for in-plane 
shear (model D), in terms of the normal stresses uiσ , 
uoσ , liσ , and loσ  as shown for general loading (model A), 
are defined as

Figure 5.  Decomposition of the general structural stress distributions 
of a strip model.  Model A represents a strip model under general 
distributions of the normal stresses xσ  and the shear stresses xzτ .  
The general stress distributions of model A can be decomposed into 
several symmetric or anti-symmetric structural stress distributions: 
symmetric counter bending (model B), anti-symmetric central bending 
(model C), symmetric tension/compression (model D), anti-symmetric 
in-plane shear (model E), symmetric out-of-plane shear (model F) and 
anti-symmetric out-of-plane shear (model G).   
 
conditions, new analytical solutions with size 
dependence for the four types of specimens can 
therefore developed in this paper for engineering 
applications of different specimen designs. 
In this paper, closed-form stress intensity factor 
solutions at the critical locations of spot welds in four 
types of commonly used specimens are obtained based 
on elasticity theories and fracture mechanics.  The 
loading conditions for spot welds in the central parts of 
four types of specimens are first examined.  The 
resultant loads on the weld nugget and the self-balanced 
resultant loads on the lateral surface of the central parts 
of the specimens are then decomposed into various 
types of symmetric and anti-symmetric parts.  Closed-
form structural stress and stress intensity factor 
solutions for spot welds under various types of loading 
conditions are then adopted from Lin and Pan [20] to 
derive new closed-form stress intensity factor solutions 
at the critical locations of spot welds in the four types of 
specimens. The closed-form solutions for the four types 
of specimens are selectively validated by the three-
dimensional finite element computational results that are 
reported in Lin and Pan [21]. 
CLOSED-FORM SOLUTIONS FOR FOUR TYPES 
OF SPOT-WELD SPECIMENS 
Figure 1 shows halves of a lap-shear specimen, a 
square-cup specimen, a U-shape specimen and a 
coach-peel specimen.  In this figure, the applied forces 
are marked by the bold arrows.  These specimens are 
commonly used to obtain the mechanical properties of 
spot welds.  For clear demonstration of spot weld 
locations, only halves of specimens are shown.  The 
spot welds are idealized as circular cylinders and shown 
as half cylinders in the figure.  The sheet metals used to 
make these specimens have the thickness t .  As shown 
in the figures, these specimens have the specimen width 
b2  and the nugget diameter a2 .  The bold arrows 
represent the resultant forces F  or 2/F  applied to the 
specimens.  In Figure 1(a), L  represents the length of 
the upper or lower sheets of lap-shear specimens and 
V  represents the overlap length.  In Figure 1(d), the 
eccentricity distance between the applied force and the 
center of the spot weld in coach-peel specimens is also 
denoted as L .  In this paper, new analytical stress 
intensity factor solutions at the critical locations of spot 
welds in four types of specimens are developed based 
on the central square parts of the specimens with a rigid 
inclusion under various types of loading conditions.  We 
will concentrate on the upper halves of the four types of 
specimens to derive the closed-form stress intensity 
factor solutions.  In the following derivations of the 
closed-form analytical solutions, the spot welds in the 
specimens are treated as rigid inclusions. 
LAP-SHEAR SPECIMEN 
According to the works of Radaj [4] and Radaj and 
Zhang [6-8], the loads of various types of specimens 
containing spot welds can be decomposed into several 
symmetric and anti-symmetric parts based on the 
superposition principle of the linear elasticity theory.  
Figure 2 schematically shows the decomposition of the 
shear load of the central part of a lap-shear specimen.  
Based on the schematic of the lap-shear specimen 
shown in Figure 1(a), schematics of the central square 
parts of the specimens under various types of loads are 
shown as model A to F in Figure 2.  As shown in the 
figure, we select the overlap length V  equal to the plate 
width b2 .  In these schematics, two square plates with 
the width b2  and the thickness t  represent the upper or 
lower parts of the overlap sheets and the rigid circular 
cylinder with the diameter a2  represents the spot weld.  
As shown in Figure 2, model A represents a spot weld 
under lap-shear loading conditions.  For model A, F  
represents the total shear force of the resultant force 
uniformly applied to the edges of the square plates along 
the interfacial surface of the rigid circular cylinder.  For 
model B, the shear force F  applied along the interfacial 
plane is now changed to the membrane force F  and the 
bending moment 2/Ft  applied to the mid-planes of the 
upper and lower plates.  The shear force F  and the 
bending moment 2/Ft  of a lap-shear specimen is then 
decomposed into four types of symmetric and anti-
symmetric loads: counter bending (model C), central 
bending (model D), in-plane shear (model E), and 
tension (model F).  The bending moments in models C 
and D have a magnitude of 4/Ft , and the forces in 
models E and F have a magnitude of 2/F .  The 
decomposition of the shear load of lap-shear specimens 
was presented in Lin et al. [19]. 
After the decomposition of the shear load of lap-shear 
specimens, the structural stresses of models C, D, E 
and F can be derived based on the closed-form moment, 
force and stress solutions of these rigid inclusion models 
listed in Lin and Pan [20].  Substituting the structural 
stress solutions into the expressions of the stress 
intensity factor solutions listed in Lin and Pan [20] gives 
the stress intensity factor solutions for lap-shear 
specimens.  The IK  and IIK  solutions at the critical 
locations (points A and B as shown in Figure 1(a)) are 
given as

COACH-PEEL SPECIMEN 
Figure 5 schematically shows the decomposition of the 
load of the right square part of a coach-peel specimen 
shown in Figure 1(d).  The distance from the center of 
the nugget to the right edge of the coach-peel specimen 
shown in Figure 1(d) is selected to be the half width b .  
Based on the schematic of the coach-peel specimen 
shown in Figure 1(d), schematics of the right square part 
of the specimens near the spot welds under various 
types of loads are shown as model A to G in Figure 5.  
As shown in Figure 5, model A represents the right 
square part of a coach-peel specimen under 
opening/peeling loading conditions.  Here, F~  represents 
the uniformly distributed transverse shear force applied 
to the left edge of the square plates.  bM
~
 represents the 
bending moment applied to the left edge of the square 
plates.  Similar to U-shape specimens, the shift of the 
transverse shear force F~  to the left edge of the square 
plate causes the bending moment bM
~
 ( )(~ bLF −×= ) 
along the left edge of the square plates.  As shown in 
Figure 5, the geometry and loading conditions of model 
A are symmetric with respect to the interfacial surface of 
the rigid cylinder.  Therefore, only the upper half of 
model A is considered.  Model B represents the upper 
half of model A.  F  ( bF~2= ) represents the resultant 
opening force applied to the center of the circular 
interfacial surface of the weld nugget.  Additional 
bending moments M  ( 2~2 bFFb == ) and bMb ~2  are 
required for equilibrium.  The forces and moments of 
model B can be decomposed into three types of 
symmetric and anti-symmetric loads: central bending, 
counter opening and counter bending.  Based on the 
earlier discussions for U-shape specimens, the counter 
opening condition can be approximately decomposed 
into two types of symmetric loads: opening and counter 
bending.  Therefore, the forces and moments of model B 
are approximately decomposed into three types of loads: 
central bending (model C and model G), opening (model 
D), and counter bending (model E and model F). 
The detailed derivations of the structural stresses and 
stress intensity factor solution for coach-peel specimens 
are similar to those of lap-shear specimens and are not 
reported here.  The IK  solution at the critical location of 
coach-peel specimens (point A as shown in Figure 1(d)) 
is given as

CONCLUSION 
Closed-form stress intensity factor solutions at the 
critical locations of spot welds in four types of commonly 
used specimens are obtained based on elasticity 
theories and fracture mechanics.  The loading conditions 
for spot welds in the central parts of four types of 
specimens are first examined.  The resultant loads on 
the weld nugget and the self-balanced resultant loads on 
the lateral surface of the central parts of the specimens 
are then decomposed into various types of symmetric 
and anti-symmetric parts.  Closed-form structural stress 
and stress intensity factor solutions for spot welds under 
various types of loading conditions are then adopted 
from Lin and Pan [20] to derive new closed-form stress 
intensity factor solutions at the critical locations of spot 
welds in the four types of specimens.  The closed-form 
solutions for the four types of specimens are selectively 
validated by the three-dimensional finite element 
computational results which are reported in Lin and Pan 
[21].
