Abstract: (Keywords: DS-CDMA, Multi-rate- Multi-path, Interference Projection Method, 
PIC) 
 In this report, MC and MPG access are chosen to implement the multi-rate 
DS-CDMA system. In MC access, a high rate user transmits data symbols using several 
spreading sequences. In MPG access, all signals are modulated to the same bandwidth, but 
the processing gain (PG) (and the symbol duration) of high rate users would be smaller 
than that of the lower rate users so that the high rate users can transmit more symbols in a 
given time. One of the serious shortcomings of the CDMA system is the multiple access 
interference (MAI), which is produced when there are multiple users using the same 
frequency band simultaneously . The other source of interference is the multi-path effect. 
In this report, the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) scheme is used to suppress both 
interferences. By utilizing the interference projection method in the PIC scheme, the 
transmission power of every user can be estimated, and then a better performance of the 
multi-rate multi-path CDMA system is obtained. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
There are two famous multi-rate access schemes for DS-CDMA system: Multi-code 
(MC) access and Multiple processing gain (MPG) access [1][2][3][4]. MC access uses 
more spreading codes than single rate system. In MPG access, the different rate services 
are assigned spreading sequences with different processing gains in order to match the 
variable data rates. Because the chip rate is fixed in the whole system, the high rate user 
who has shorter symbol interval is supported by choosing the small processing gain.

, where kL  is the number of paths for user k. In this report, kL L=  is assumed. ( )k,lτ t  
and ( )k,lα t  are the time varying multi-path delay and channel gain in the lth path for user 
k. In the following, we consider a dual rate system for simplicity. We assume that the 
multi-rate system here can support two rates: the basic rate 1/ bT   and q  times of the 
basic rate. We also assume that 1K  physical users use the higher rate, and 2K   physical 
users use the basic rate. Hence, there are totally 1 2qK K+  effective users in this dual rate 
system for both MC and MPG access. We assign serial numbers to all the effective users 
for convenience: The first q  effective users with serial numbers 1,2, ,k q= "  are split 
from one physical high rate user, the following q  effective users with 
1,  2,  ,  2k q q q= + + "  are split from another physical high rate user, and so on. 
Effective users have serial number 1 1 1 21,  2,  ,  k K q K q K q K= + + +"  are 2K  basic rate 
users.  
The only difference in system model between MC and MPG access is the definition 
of the spreading waveform. The spreading waveforms of all effective users in MC system 
can be defined in one basic symbol interval as

The parameter ( ) { }1, 1gks ∈ + −  is the gth element of the spreading code of effective user k, 
( )tψ is the pulsewise chip waveform defined in the time interval [0, )cT , G is called the 
processing gain, and c bT T G=  is the chip duration. The spreading waveforms of basic 
rate physical users in MPG system are the same as equation (2).

4. Simulations 
 
The bit rate of high rate users is assumed to be three times of that of low rate users. 
The processing gain is chosen to be 63G =  , and Gold code is used. The channel is 
assumed to be a frequency selective, slow fading channel. The number of paths is 2L = .
