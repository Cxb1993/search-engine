摘  要 
土壤中受多環芳香烴化合物 (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, PAHs)污染
問題已愈受重視，PAHs 已被證實超過 30 種及數百種衍生物具有致癌性及
致突變性。目前對於土壤中 PAHs 之整治處理常以物化萃取方式，而物化方
法只能對各相間轉換，後續仍需進ㄧ步以其他技術處理，而且還可能破壞
當地生態資源，近年來研究發現利用植物復育可原地修復受有機物污染之
土壤。本研究進行人工添加 Pyrene 作為污染土壤，利用盆栽試驗種植紫花
苜蓿，在不同濃度之 Pyrene 污染土壤中，分別添加 5%，測試紫花苜蓿對土
壤中 Pyrene 之降解效果。試驗結果顯示添加 5%培養土於 Pyrene 濃度為 0、
50、100、200、300、400、500 mg kg -1 之污染土壤中，試驗得知 Pyrene濃度為 400 
mg kg-1時為紫花苜蓿致死濃度。在石英砂、紅壤及沖積土中 Pyrene濃度為 50 mg kg-1
降解率最高為 74.7%、69.6%、66.7%，無種植降解率為 24.0%、21.7%、19.5%。紫花苜
蓿在相同 Pyrene 濃度下的三種土壤中其降解率，石英砂＞紅壤＞沖積土，在紫花苜蓿
在石英砂中 Pyrene濃度為 0、100、200、300 mg kg-1其單位面積鮮重依序為 0.070 、0.064、
0.040、0.033 g cm-1，可看出隨土壤中 Pyrene濃度增加單位面積紫花苜蓿鮮重有下降趨
勢，致紫花苜蓿對 Pyrene的降解效果變差，且紅壤與沖積土亦有ㄧ樣趨勢。

ㄧ、前言 
戴奧辛、多氯聯苯類及多環芳香族碳氫化合物等有機污染物常在工業上之生產、製
造、廢棄或燃燒之過程中進入空氣或土壤中，然後再進入動植物體內，經由食物鏈而進
入人體而影響人體健康(Kylin et al., 1994；Alcock et al., 1996)。持久性有機污染物結構
穩定，在環境中不容易發生光分解或水解之現象，故在環境中累積殘留時間極長。持久
性有機污染物對生物之毒性高，因此持久性有機污染物對環境生態系統之衝擊力極大。 
環境中長期暴露於持久性有機污染物(POPs)的物質會經由大氣傳輸至偏遠地區，不
但會在食物鏈中累積，並可能長期累積於自然環境，而造成野生動物產生致畸胎性、腫
瘤等危害。美國環保署調查顯示，野生動物長久暴露於環境賀爾蒙與POPs下，將會造成
許多生理機能的改變，並且有越來越多的案例指出鳥類、魚類、貝類、龜類及哺乳類等
的病變與環境賀爾蒙與POPs的污染密切關係(Colborn et al., 1993)。 
    本研究以 Pyrene作為代表污染物，以人工添加方式模擬土壤受 Pyrene污染後，以
PAHs降解效果佳的紫花苜蓿作為植物復育之植物，探討復育前、後 Pyrene之降解率。

    為了解紫花苜蓿在夏季及冬季兩個季節植物生長差異而影響污染物Pyrene降解效
果，因此於 96年 9月 1日進行盆栽試驗。盆栽試驗濃度為 50、100、200、300、400、
500 mg kg-1之人工污染Pyrene土壤，再添加 5%市售培養土。種植紫花苜蓿，每一種處
理四重複。待百慕達草生長四週後，批次萃取Pyrene，以HPLC分析其溶出量。 
2.2.3 樣品分析 
 取 1.00 g復育後植物根圈之Pyrene污染土，置於瓶蓋附鐵氟龍內襯之玻璃離心管
內，加入10.0 mL乙腈，於無光照環境下以120 rpm(振幅5 cm)震盪2小時，再以260 g(2000 
rpm)離心後取上澄液以孔目大小為 0.45 µm之圓盤過濾紙過濾，以HPLC分析萃取液中
Pyrene濃度，試驗中各種處理之樣品均上述方法作四重複分析。 
2.2.4生育調查 
植株先以自來水沖洗，再以逆滲透水洗兩次，待植株滴乾後，秤其鮮重(fresh 
weight)，再於烘箱中以 50℃烘乾 24小時，然後秤其乾物產量(dry matter yield)。

3.2紫花苜蓿在三種土壤中降解率比較 
由圖 1盆栽試驗中發現於相同Pyrnen濃度下紫花苜蓿在石英砂、紅壤與沖積
土三種土壤中降解率比較，圖中小寫英文字母代表同種Pyrene濃度下三種土之差
異，大寫英文字母代表同種土壤不同Pyrene濃度之差異，降解率石英砂>紅壤>
沖積土，其原因可能是因為石英砂無有機質，紅壤有機碳含量為 0.56%，而沖積
土為 0.85%，因沖積土有機碳含量較紅壤多可提供疏水性孔隙較紅壤多，使得沖
積土能固定較多量之Pyrene，因此沖積土降解率較差。Ghosh等(2000)指出PAHs
在碳/木質所衍生之顆粒(coal-or wood-derived particles)的研究上發現，若與土壤
中矽質顆粒比較，碳/木質顆粒在土壤中的含量僅約 5%，但卻含有有機污染物
62%，而其餘的 38%則存在於黏粒/坋粒上，顯示有機污染物易受有機碳影響大。
上述結果顯示，土壤有機質對Pyrene吸附效應較黏粒含量明顯，此現象與。

四、結論與建議 
    由上述試驗結果得知以下幾點結論： 
1. 試驗得知 Pyrene濃度為 400 mg kg-1時為紫花苜蓿致死濃度。 
2. 種植紫花苜蓿石英砂、紅壤及沖積土中 Pyrene濃度為 50 mg kg-1降解率最高
為 74.7%、69.6%、66.7%，無種植降解率為 24.0%、21.7%、19.5%。 
3. 紫花苜蓿在相同 Pyrene濃度下的三種土壤中其降解率，石英砂＞紅壤＞沖積
土。 
4. 紫花苜蓿在石英砂中 Pyrene濃度為 0、100、200、300 mg kg-1其單位面積鮮
重依序為 0.070 、0.064、0.040、0.033 g cm-1，可看出隨土壤中 Pyrene濃度增
加單位面積紫花苜蓿鮮重有下降趨勢，致紫花苜蓿對 Pyrene的降解效果變
差，且紅壤與沖積土亦有ㄧ樣趨勢。 
    由以上結果得知紫花苜蓿對 Pyrene降解效果較百慕達草佳，其原因是在相
同單位盆栽面積下紫花苜蓿鮮重大於百慕達草，因此在後續運用於現地以植生復
育方式整治受污染土壤，對於植物篩選亦為一重要因子。

四、建議 
1. 近年來全球暖化的議題備受關注，因為全球各地氣候異常的徵候愈益嚴重，加上水資源的耗
竭，食品安全問題應為未來各國政府急欲解決之壓力。如何提高農作物產量又能維持其品質
及安全，不被重金屬、農藥污染。尤其水稻田的灌溉水管理直接影響到水資源分配的社會公
平正義問題，同時對生態環境及溫室效應皆有深遠影響。是政府應以宏觀全面角度，及早規
劃因應此一議題。 
2. 日本的農地土壤污染主要是集中在廢棄礦場和金屬煉製廠附近，因其灌溉 用水系統獨立完
整，不會和雨水系統、區域排水及下水道系統混和。為因應未來糧食及水資源問題，台灣地
區的灌排分離問題實應及早面對解決，否則只會讓問題更形複雜難解。 
3. 應成立一研究機構或單位，從農作物的生產環境、農漁牧水產品之安全、環境介質污染傳輸
問題，作一垂直整合，建立各項基線資料庫，增加資料效益。如以目前各單位缺乏橫向聯繫、
資訊未能整合利用之情況，國人的食品安全問題及環境風險問題將無法徹底解決。 
4. 為因應環境議題國際化，本署應積極主動參與國際活動與會議，加入國內外相關土壤及地下
水團體，延伸觸角，擴展視野，以利收集國內外相關經驗，藉助技術經驗交流，並建立國際
關係，以解決國內土壤及地下水污染問題。

Abstract 
 
Many industrial effluents and various emissions from industrial processes and exhausts 
from motor vehicles systems often contain a group of phenolic compounds known as 
biorecalcitrant chemical species that resist biological treatments.  Most of the laboratory 
studies reported on efficiencies of various catalysts in degrading substrates including organic 
pollutants is under air-equilibrated condition but not under anoxic condition.  In the present 
study, the catalytic effect of birnessite (δ-MnO2) in degrading different phenolic compounds 
under anoxic condition compared to aeration condition has been evaluated by kinetic studies 
of pE versus pH of the reaction systems and the associated mineralization of these compounds.  
The reactions were carried out in suspensions at initial pH 6.00 under air and N2 atmosphere 
at room temperature and free of microbial activity.  All the treatments including controls were 
carried out in three replicates.  The kinetic pE-pH relevance and tendencies for each phenolic 
compound in the reaction system depended on its structural characteristics and aeration or 
anoxic condition.  Although inverse kinetic tendencies for each pE-pH pair of the reaction 
systems were observed in the first 10-h reaction period, the tendencies were significantly 
different and showed compound structure- and aeration versus anoxic-dependent mechanisms.

1. Introduction 
 
      Nitrogen oxides and soot particulate matter emissions from diesel engines pose 
major health hazards.  Due to their small size these emissions can penetrate in to lungs 
and induce severe health problems [1].  Hence many attempts are being made to 
develop suitable technologies to convert these toxic emissions into nontoxic 
compounds.  Platinum-based catalysts seem to represent the best solution up-to-date, 
providing NO to NO2 oxidation, which allows soot oxidation at quite low 
temperatures [2 – 4].  However, noble metal catalysts are expensive and are troubled 
with poison problems.  A cheap and efficient substitute is therefore still desired.  
López-Fonseca et al. [5] studied the kinetic analysis of Mn-catalyzed combustion of 
diesel soot surrogates and reported that MnO2 added to diesel soot surrogates, strongly 
decreased the ignition temperatures by 150–200 oC.  The activation energy of the 
catalytic process was lowered by about 10–15 kJ mol–1 for two carbon blacks, selected 
as diesel soot surrogates, with respect to the non-catalytic oxidation.  Lamaita et al. [6] 
synthesized and characterized two MnO2 catalysts and then investigated their catalytic 
activity in complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 and water.  The reaction results 
showed that the high catalytic activity of the prepared oxides could be related to the 
simultaneous presence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions and OH– species generated by Mn4+ 
vacancies.  Tikhomirov et al. [7] used thermo-gravity coupled with Fourier transform 
infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and flow reactor experiment to study soot oxidation 
on MnOx-CeO2 mixed oxide catalysts in model diesel exhaust gas.  They reported that 
the ignition temperature in TG-FTIR experiments for a 1:20 mixture of soot and 
catalyst was found to be around 280 oC, which is significantly lower than for the 
individual oxides.  Further, they found that NO is oxidized to NO2 on the surface of 
the catalyst, which is stored on the catalyst as nitrate at low temperature.  The nitrate 
 5
product whereas solution phase 14C concentrations increased from 16 to 39% when 
total catechol added was increased by two times.  Chen et al. [14] prepared Mn-Ce-O 
composite catalysts with Ce/(Mn + Ce) atomic bulk ratios ranging from 0 to 100% by 
co-precipitation.  They selected phenol as a model pollutant and the catalytic 
oxidation was carried out in a batch slurry reactor using O2 as the oxidizing agent 
under mild reaction conditions.  The results showed that the catalytic activity was 
greatly influenced by the catalyst composition.  The catalysts with Mn/Ce ratio of 6/4 
was found to be the most active in reducing both phenol concentration and total 
organic carbon (TOC).  Formaldehyde (HCHO) is still a major indoor pollutant in 
Japanese air-tight houses and is the subject of numerous complaints regarding health 
disorders.  Sekine [15] tested the removal efficiencies of several metal oxides for 
HCHO removal in a static reaction vessel and found that MnO2 could react with 
HCHO and release CO2 at room temperature.  Tang et al. [16] reported that MnOx-
CeO2 catalyst prepared by a modified co-precipitation method and calcination at 773 
K exhibited extremely high catalytic activity and 100% conversion of HCHO was 
achieved at a temperature as low as 373 K . 
     Much of Mn in soils occurs in the form of Mn oxides.  These Mn oxides contribute 
to many important properties of soils and to certain chemical reactions of 
environmental importance, both favorable and unfavorable.  Favorable contributions 
include the selective adsorption of several heavy metals, some of which are toxic (e.g., 
Ba and Pb) and some of which are important nutrients (e.g., Co).  In addition, the 
strong oxidizing ability of Mn oxides contributes to the formation of humus and the 
detoxification of As.  Less favorable is that the oxidation of Cr by Mn oxides 
increases Cr solubility and toxicity [17].  Conventional remediation methods of 
phenol-polluted systems have some disadvantages due to high cost, time-consuming 
procedures and formation of toxic residues.  Conversely, the use of oxidative catalysts, 
 7
was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and then freeze-dried.  The freeze-dried δ-
MnO2 was examined by X-ray powder diffraction and infrared absorption 
spectroscopy.  The X-ray diffractogram of the synthesized δ-MnO2 showed poorly 
crystalline characteristics and resembled that described by McKenzie [21].  In 
addition, its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectrum was close to that 
described by Potter and Rossman [22, 23].  The specific surface area of the freeze-
dried sample (0.2–2 µm) was estimated by the ethylene glycol monoethyl ether 
retention method [24].  The specific surface area of the δ-MnO2 was 213 ± 3 m2 g–1.  
Catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene), and 
hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) all with molecular weight 110.11 Dalton were 
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).  The structural formulas of catechol, 
resorcinol, and hydroquinone were shown in Fig. 1. 
 
2.2. Determination of pE and pH kinetics 
      To establish that all the reaction systems in this study were abiotic, 200 mg of 
freeze-dried δ-MnO2 were sterilized at 121 oC and at 0.101 MPa for 15 min in an 
autoclave.  The autoclaved δ-MnO2 was suspended in about 15 mL of sterilized 
aqueous solution, which contained 0.02% (w/v) of thimerosal (sodium 
ethylmercurithiosalicylate, an antiseptic), in a 25 mL plastic vial.  The pH of the 
suspension was adjusted to 6.00 with 0.01 M HCl over a period of several days until it 
was stabilized.  The suspension in the vial was transferred to autoclaved 100 mL glass 
vial.  A small amount of autoclaved deionized distilled water (the antiseptic added and 
pH 6.00) was used to rinse the plastic vial.  The suspension in the glass vial was 
weighed, and deionized distilled water (pH 6.00) was added to adjust the volume of 
the δ-MnO2 suspension to 35 mL.  The glass vial was caped with a plastic cap with 
two holes to fix a combination pH electrode and a combination Pt electrode, which 
 9
autoclaved 500 mL, wide-mouth Erlenmeyer glass flask.  A small amount of 
autoclaved deionized distilled water (the antiseptic added and pH 6.00) was used to 
rinse the plastic vial.  The suspension in the flask was weighed, and sterilized 
deionized distilled water (pH 6.00) was added to adjust the volume of the δ-MnO2 
suspension to 35 mL.  An autoclaved 50 mL polyethylene centrifuge tube containing 
10 mL of 0.33 M KOH was placed in the flask in such a way that, it is leaned against 
the wall of the flask.  One 20-mL autoclaved polyethylene vial (flat bottom), 
containing 5 mL of 0.1 M catechol, hydroquinone, or resorcinol (pH 6.00).was 
similarly placed in the flask.  Finally, each flask was sealed with a cap to prevent the 
exchange of air.  The cap of the flask was connected through Tygon tubing to a 
manometer containing the manometer fluid (Brodie solution [0.79 M NaCl and 23 
mM sodium choleate]) [26].  Each flask was slowly shaken to overturn the flat-
bottomed polyethylene vial to mix the catechol, hydroquinone, or resorcinol solution 
with the δ-MnO2 suspension, and then agitated in water bath at 25 oC for 90 h under 
air.  At the end of the reaction period, the manometer fluid in the manometer was 
flushed slowly with air from the open end of the manometer to push the manometer 
fluid level up to the end of the manometer that was connected to the Tygon tubing.  
The end of the Tygon tubing was then closed.  Each flask with the Tygon tubing was 
disconnected from the manometer and flushed with N2 gas from the stopcock that was 
connected to the cap of the reaction flask.  The gases present in the reaction flask and 
the Tygon tubing were then purged into a tube containing 10 mL of 0.33 M KOH to 
absorb the total CO2 present.  The KOH solution and the other KOH solution, which 
was placed in the flask to absorb the CO2 released during the reaction period, were 
determined the amounts of total CO2 released by titration [27].  All the experiments, 
including the controls, were conducted in three replicated reactors for each 
experiment. 
 11 
      To establish that reactions in this experiment were abiotic, a small amount of each 
reaction suspension, which contained phenolic compound (catechol, hydroquinone, or 
resorcinol), thimerosal, autoclaved δ-MnO2, and sterilized deionized distilled water in 
the experiment as described above, was inoculated onto agar plates of GYEN (glucose, 
yeast extract, and nutrient broth) [28], AIA  (actinomycetes isolation agar), and 
Czapek-Dox (for fungal inoculation) [29] both at the beginning and at the end of the 
reaction period.  All inoculated plates were incubated at 25 oC for 40 days. 
 
2.5. Determinations of degraded phenolic compounds, dissolved Mn and adsorbed 
Mn, and oxidation number of Mn in reacted δ-MnO2  
      After 90 h reaction period, the reaction suspension in each Erlenmeyer flask 
described above was transferred to a centrifuging bottle to centrifuge at 10,000 g for 
20 min to separate the supernatant from the sediment.  5 mL of the supernatant was 
transferred to 100 mL separating funnel and added 20 mL ethyl ether and shaken in an 
up-and-down mechanical shaker (amplitude 5.0 cm and 120 rpm) for 30 min to 
extract the remaining phenolic compound.  The aqueous solution in the lower layer 
was retransferred to separating funnel and added ethyl ether and shaken repeatedly to 
extract the remaining phenolic compound.  The ethyl ether extraction solution in the 
upper layer was collected.  On the basis of the results of our preliminary recovery 
experiment for the three phenolic compound solutions used in the study, the 
suspension of catechol or hydroquinone reaction system was extracted with ethyl 
ether three times, while that of resorcinol reaction system was extracted five times.  
The collected ethyl ether extracts for each remaining phenolic compound were 
combined and transferred to an evaporating dish in a fumehood to evaporate the ethyl 
ether.  The residue in each evaporating dish was dissolved with deionized distilled 
water and then the solution transferred to a 50 mL volumetric flask and made up to the 
 13
titrated with standardized 0.025 M Na2S2O3 solution and its consumed volume was 
recorded.  The titrated suspension in the flask was transferred to 100 mL volumetric 
flask and diluted with deionized distilled water up to the mark.  The suspension for 
each reaction system was filtered by ultrafiltration (0.2 µm pore size filter) and the 
filtrate was subjected to the determination of total dissolve Mn.  Finally, on the basis 
of equal titrated equivalent numbers between oxidizing and reducing agents, the 
derived equation was used to compute the oxidation number of Mn in MnOx, which is 
supposed the altered form of δ-MnO2 after reacting with phenolic compound for each 
reaction system. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
      Microbial growth was not evident in the reaction systems studied, indicating that 
all reactions occurred were abiotic in nature (not shown). 
 
3.1. pH and pE kinetics of reaction systems 
      Fig. 2 presents the characterization of pE and pH kinetics of catechol-δ-MnO2 
reaction system.  At the beginning of the degradation of catechol catalyzed by δ-MnO2, 
the pH of the reaction system abruptly increased to 9.55 and 8.85 within 1 min and 
then decreased to around 8.42 and 8.05, respectively, within 3 min under air and N2 
atmosphere, although the initial pH of both reaction systems was adjusted to 6.00.  
Then the pH of the reaction system under N2 atmosphere increased rapidly with time 
to around 8.7 from 3 to 30 min, while that of the system under air increased slowly to 
around 8.55.  The increasing rate of pH from reaction time of 30 to 70 min of the 
system under N2 atmosphere was much slower than its reaction time of 3 to 30 min.  
However, the increase in the rate of pH of the system under air was only marginal.  
Subsequently, from 70 to 600 min of the reaction period, the increasing rate of pH of 
 15
reasonable.  On the contrary, under air (in the presence of O2 molecules), both the 
consumption of protons and electrons by the reduction of O2 molecules (Eq. 3) results 
in the decreasing of pH with time from 70 min to 600 min of the reaction period.  This 
decreasing rate of pH of the reaction system may be caused by simple addition of O2 
molecules or their synergistic effect with δ-MnO2 to promote the degradation of 
catechol in the suspension.  Further, the pH difference between the two systems under 
air and N2 atmosphere increased with increasing reaction time until the end of the 
reaction period (Fig. 2).  Finally, the pH of the reaction system under N2 atmosphere 
at 600 min of the reaction period was around 9.46, while that of the reaction system 
under air was around 8.12.

      According to the dependence of measured electromotive force (EMF) by using Pt 
electrode on both suspension pH and temperature, each of the measured EMF value 
for the reaction system under air and N2 atmosphere was calibrated to Eh7 (Eh at pH 
7.0) using the derived Eq. 4 obtained in this study. 
 
Eh7 = ± EMF + 205 + 59.16 (pH – 7.00) – 1.125 (t – 25)                                    Eq. 4 
 
where Eh7 (mV) is calibrated reduction potential of the reaction system at pH 7.0,

decreasing rate.  Basically, from 25 to 240 min of reaction period, the decreasing rate 
of pE was much higher than that in the period from 240 to around 560 min.  Then the 
decreasing rate became higher until 600 min (Fig. 2).  The change of pE with time 
from 60 min after the beginning until 600 min reaction period under air and N2 
atmosphere showed increase and decrease trend, respectively.  This clearly indicates 
the role of O2 molecules in the reaction system.  In the reaction system under air O2 
molecules can act as an electron acceptor which in turn promotes the increase of 
reduction potential of the reaction suspension (Eq. 3).  However, in the reaction 
system under N2 (in the absence of O2 molecules) the pE continuously decreased with 
time until the end of 600 min of reaction period (Fig. 2). 
There were various stages of kinetics for pH and pE of the catechol in solution 
catalyzed to degrade by δ-MnO2 at 25oC under air and N2 atmosphere during the first 
600 min reaction period (Fig. 2).  In addition, the change tendencies for each pair of 
pH versus pE for the reaction system under air or N2 atmosphere showed individual 
distinct characteristics.  Moreover, each pair of change tendency of pH versus pE 
showed almost symmetric pattern.  Based on the viewpoint of kinetics of the reaction 
systems under air and N2 atmosphere, within 3 min from the beginning they were very 
fast reaction rates and then still quite fast reaction rates from 3 to around 30 min.  
Although the reaction rates for both systems under air and N2 atmosphere 
substantially decreased from 30 min after the beginning of the reaction, it was still 
observed that the equilibrium of the reactions had not attained until the end of 600 
min reaction period (Fig. 2). 
From the beginning to1 min of the reaction period, the pH value of hydroquinone-
δ-MnO2 reaction system under air abruptly increased from 6.00 to 9.92 and then 
rapidly decreased to 9.82 within 3 min, while the pH value of the reaction system 
increased very rapidly from 6.00 to 9.68 within 3 min under N2 atmosphere (Fig. 3).  
 19
system under N2 atmosphere gradually decreased from 20 to 600 min (Fig. 3).  The 
change tendencies of each pH-pE pair with time during the 600 min reaction period 
reflected the kinetics of the reaction systems under air and N2 atmosphere.  They 
clearly show that from the beginning to 1 or 3 min of reaction period, hydroquinone 
catalyzed by δ-MnO2 were very fast reactions.  Then from 1 or 3 min to 20 min of 
reaction period, the reaction systems still keep fast reaction rates.  However, O2 
molecules also exert substantial promotion effect in catalytic degradation of 
hydroquinone by δ-MnO2 for a 600 min reaction period. 
From the beginning to 1 min of reaction period, the pH of resorcinol-δ-MnO2 
reaction systems under air and N2 atmosphere abruptly increased with time to 6.72 
and 6.80, respectively.  Then from 1 to 20 min of reaction period, the pH of reaction 
systems under air and N2 atmosphere rapidly increased with time but the increasing 
rate was much less under air than under N2 atmosphere (Fig. 4).  Subsequently, the 
increasing rate of pH decreased with time for both reaction systems from 20 min to 
around 360 min.  From 360 to 600 min of the reaction period, the increasing rate of 
pH of the reaction system under N2 atmosphere reached to a constant, while the pH of 
the reaction system under air was almost constant (Fig. 4).  Correspondingly, from the 
beginning to 3 min of the reaction period, the pE increased to 9.50 and 9.35, under N2 
atmosphere and air, respectively.  The decreasing rate of pE of the reaction system 
under air decreased with time from 3 to around 60 min and then the pE increased with 
time from 60 to around 95 min.  Again, the decreasing rate of pE decreased with time 
from 95 to around 360 min and reached a constant from 360 to 600 min reaction 
period.  Similarly, from 3 to around 25 min, the decreasing rate of pE with time of the 
reaction system under N2 atmosphere was much slower than that from 25 to 40 min of 
the reaction period.  From 40 to 80 min, the decreasing rate of pE with time was little 
slower than that from 25 to 40 min.  However, from 80 to around 240 min, the 
 21
using active carbon as catalyst.  Temperature and O2 partial pressure for the reactions 
had been varied from 120 to 160 oC and 1-2 bar, respectively.  They used the 
distribution of the main intermediates quantitatively assessed by means of high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to develop a global kinetic 
model for the phenol oxidation over active carbon.  Six of the seven proposed 
corresponding reaction equations of the reaction network developed were O2 
molecules required processes.  In this study, the kinetics in terms of the changes of pE 
and pH with time of the reaction systems under air with O2 partial pressure of much 
less than 1 bar and at 25 oC was significantly different from those of the reaction 
systems under N2 atmosphere.  This clearly indicates the important role of O2 alone as 
well as synergistic effect with δ-MnO2 in promoting the degradation of phenolic 
compounds. 
 
3.2. Final O2 concentrations and CO2 release of the reaction systems 
      At the end of a 90 h reaction period, the O2 concentrations of the reaction systems 
under air were significantly lower in the presence of δ-MnO2 than in its absence.  
Moreover, the final O2 concentrations of the reaction systems in the absence of δ-
MnO2 were insignificantly different from their corresponding initial O2 concentrations 
(Table 1).  This indicates that δ-MnO2 promotes O2 consumption in the reaction 
systems under air.  The sequence of the amounts of CO2 released from the reaction 
systems under air was catechol > hydroquinone ≥ resorcinol in the presence of δ-
MnO2 and the differences between catechol and hydroquinone or between catechol 
and resorcinol involved systems were statistically significant (Table 1).  However, the 
amounts of CO2 released from the same reaction systems but under N2 atmosphere 
were drastically reduced and the differences among different phenolic compounds 
involved systems were not significant.  For each phenolic compound system, the 
 23
showed that if sufficient reaction period is allowed, the reaction systems involved 
with the three phenolic compound will reach equilibrium state and more than 2 to 3 
times of their catalytic mineralization will be obtained (not shown).  Moreover, it was 
reported that catalytic mineralization and polymerization of phenolic compounds 
proceeded simultaneously and stable humic-like substances were formed in the 
reaction systems [13, 18, 25, 37–39].  Further, the evidence of catalytic 
polymerization of the three phenolic compounds (formations of various degrees of 
dark-brown products in the supernatants of the reaction suspensions) was also 
observed at the end of 90 h reaction period.  Accordingly, catalytic mineralization of 
the three phenolic compounds to release CO2 was only to some extents in this study 
(Table 1).  In the absence of phenolic compounds trace amounts of CO2 detected in 
the reaction systems may be due to the original amount of CO2 present in the purged 
air and N2 (Table 1). 
 
3.3. Final pH values and oxidation numbers of Mn in δ-MnO2 of reaction systems 
      At the end of a 90 h reaction period, the final pH of phenolic compound–δ-MnO2 
reaction systems under air or N2 atmosphere was significantly higher in the presence 
of δ-MnO2 than in its absence (Table 2).  This is mainly attributed to that δ-MnO2 
overrode proton when catalyzing the oxidative degradation of phenolic compounds, 
leading to the increase of pH of the reaction systems (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2).  Moreover, 
both in the presence and in the absence of δ-MnO2 the final pH of each reaction 
system was significantly lower in air than under N2 atmosphere (Table 2).  This is due 
to the release of both electrons and protons during the oxidation of phenolic 
compound in air.  However, the oxidation of phenolic compounds and subsequent 
release of protons was limited under N2 atmosphere (Eq. 2).  In the presence or in the 
absence of δ-MnO2, the differences among the final pH of the reaction systems in air 
 25
completely catalytically degraded by δ-MnO2 in their corresponding phenolic 
compound–δ-MnO2 reaction systems under air.  In addition, catechol and 
hydroquinone were also completely catalytically degraded by δ-MnO2 in their 
corresponding phenolic compound–δ-MnO2 reaction systems under N2 atmosphere 
but this is not the case of resorcinol–δ-MnO2 reaction system (Table 4).  However, in 
the absence of δ-MnO2, the oxidative degradations of phenolic compounds under air 
were drastically reduced.  Under N2 atmosphere and in the absence of δ-MnO2, 
oxidative degradation of catechol was substantially reduced and much less than that 
under air.  In hydroquinone and resorcinol reaction systems the oxidative degradation 
of hydroquinone and especially resorcinol were significantly less than those of the 
corresponding catechol system under air and N2 atmosphere (Table 4).  This clearly 
shows that chemical behavior of phenolic compounds substantially affects both 
oxidative and non-oxidative degradation of phenolic compounds in the absence of δ-
MnO2 under air and N2 atmosphere. 
      In the absence of phenolic compound, only a trace amount of dissolved Mn was 
detected in δ-MnO2 suspension under both air and N2 atmosphere, while appreciable 
amounts of dissolved and adsorbed Mn were detected in the three phenolic 
compound–δ-MnO2 reaction systems under air and N2 atmosphere (Table 4).  This 
indicates that reduction and subsequent dissolution of Mn from δ-MnO2 during 
catalytic oxidation of phenolic compounds by δ-MnO2 (Eqs. 1, 2, and 3).  Moreover, 
on the basis of the reduction of δ-MnO2 and corresponding oxidation of phenolic 
compound, equivalent of dissolved Mn versus oxidized phenolic compound in 1:1 
stoichiometry will occur in the reaction system (Eqs. 1 and 2).   However, the sum of 
the amounts of dissolved and adsorbed Mn was significantly less than the 
corresponding amount of degraded phenolic compound in each phenolic compound–
δ-MnO2 reaction system under air or N2 atmosphere (Table 4, labels of significant 
 27
degradation of organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds present in soil and 
associated groundwater environments thus merits close attention.
