determine an upper bound for the optimization problem 
considered by ignoring some constraints. Thereafter, 
we propose a GA approach to resolve this highly 
nonlinear problem. GA has been well-known to be an 
effective optimization technique that emulates the 
crossover and mutation phases in the evolution of a 
chromosome to efficaciously search the optimal 
solution. To suit the new problem, the GA employed in 
this paper possesses two distinctive features. First, 
each chromosome is comprised of not only an integer 
string for relay selection, but also 
two real number strings for bandwidth allocation and 
power distribution to accommodate the joint 
consideration. Second, new crossover and mutation 
operations are employed to accommodate these new 
chromosomes. In addition, to further alleviate the 
complexity, a low-complexity two-stage implementation 
is also addressed, which first uses a GA to determine 
the optimal relay subset, and followed by another GA 
to refine the bandwidth allocation and power 
distribution among the users and the selected relays. 
Conducted simulations show that both of the proposed 
GA and its low-complexity implementation can attain 
close performance as the upper bound and outperform 
some representative previous works. The low-
complexity version is especially appealing with 
reduced computations, yet negligible performance 
degradation.

計畫緣由與目的 
  Cooperative networks, which can provide spatial 
diversity by relaying each other’s messages to the 
destination, are an emerging transmission scheme in 
wireless communication systems [1], [2]. Two most 
widespread cooperative protocols include 
amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward 
(DF) schemes. It is well known that the performance 
of a cooperative network can be improved by 
appropriately allocating the resource and 
miscellaneous approaches have been suggested for 
optimal relay selection, power distribution, 
time/bandwidth allocation, etc. For instance, Zhao et 
al. [3] addressed a relay selection scheme which 
selected the best relay node to maximize the capacity 
in AF relay networks. Beres et al. [4] considered a 
relay selection scheme by using the relay with 
maximum channel gain. Pham et al. [5] considered a 
relay assignment to maximize the capacity by the 
mixed-integer linear programming technique in AF 
cooperative networks, and proposed a greedy 
algorithm to mitigate the computational load. Joshi 
and Boyd [6] considered a number of sensor/relay 
selection algorithms under various considerations. It 
has been observed that the system performance can be 
further enhanced if the relay selection is combined 
with the power allocation. For this, Zhao et al. [3] 
devised an optimal power distribution following the 
best relay selection to achieve even superior 
performance. Fang et al. [7] proposed an effective GA 
for joint relay selection and power distribution in AF 
cooperative networks where the source is assisted by 
either one or more relays. Chen et al. [8] addressed a 
distributed joint relay selection and power allocation 
scheme in wireless multi-hop cooperative networks. 
Phan et al. [9] considered the joint power allocation 
and relay selection in AF cooperative networks where 
each source-destination pair is constrained to be 
assisted by a set of available relays. Kadloor et al. [10] 
proposed a joint relay selection and power distribution 
scheme. To reduce the computational complexity, [10] 
also proposed a relaxed convex solution to achieve the 
near-optimal solution. Uddin et al. [11] considered a 
joint relay assignment and power distribution problem 
for multicast cooperative networks, and proposed a 
Branch and Bound technique to solve the mixed 
Boolean-convex optimization problem. 
Since bandwidth is yet another crucial resource 
concern, it is inappropriate to divide the bandwidth

as a whole to maximize the capacity of all us

 in a mating pool and 
 parent chromosomes for the 
in
ly picked c
 1,= |U , 
they satisfy the constraints (5b) and (5c), respectively. 
Step 2: (Selection) 
  In order to preserve better chromosom  
(solutions) to yield better offsprings, we employ the 
truncated selection scheme [16] which only retains T  
parent chromosomes that have higher fitness values. 
We then reproduce them
randomly select two
following crossover step. 
Step 3: (Crossover) 
  The new crossover step begins by constructing a 
(|U|+2)×1 crossover mask sequence which consists 
of 1’s and 0’s generated with equal probability [16]. 
The first |U| elements of the mask are for the relay 
selection part, while the remain 2 elements are for the 
power distribution and for the bandwidth allocation 
part. For the relay selection part, if the elements in the 
crossover mask are 1’s, the genes of the two parent 
chromosomes in the corresponding positions will be 
exchanged; whereas, if the elements are 0’s, they will 
remain unchanged. The crossover operations in the 
bandwidth allocation and the power distribution parts 
are based on the arithmetic crossover operation [19]. 
More specifically, for the parent chromosomes a and b, 
based on the arithmetic crossover operation, if the 
correspond g element in the cross mask equals 1, the 
genes at the left side of the random ross 
point, say j , remain the sa
j j' (1 ) b
me, those at the cross point 
will be regenerated as ja aβ β= − × + ×  and 
j j jb ' b (1 ) aβ β= × + − × , where β  is randomly 
distributed in (0, 1), and those at the right side of the 
cross point will be exchanged. For example, assume 
that the crossover mask sequence is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] as 
given in Fig. 2 (a). The relay selection parts of the 
parent chromosomes a and b will produce the offspring 
chromosomes a′ th the relay selection parts as 
shown in Fig. 2 (b). Also, if 0.6
and b′ wi
β =  and the cross 
point is 2, and 0.3β =  and the cross point is 3 for 
the power distribution part and the bandwidth 
allocation part, respectively, the corresponding 
offspring a′ and b′ will have the power distribution part 
and the bandwidth allocation part as shown in Fig. 2 
(c). Note that based on this crossover, the genes at the 
relay selection part will always lie in {1, . . . , |R|}, so 
the relay selection 
t u
can be easily made. This crossover 
ntil the size of the populatiooperation will repea n 
reaches P . 
Step 4: (Mutation) 
  The new mutation operation is also divided into 
two operations: the integer mutation for the relay 
selection part, and the uniform mutation for the 
bandwidth allocation and the power distribution parts. 
First, for each chromosome, we create a 3 × 1 
mutation mask sequence comprising of 1’s and 0’s 
generated according to the mutation probability pm 
[16]. In the relay selection part of the chromosome, if 
the first element of the mutation mask is 1, two gene 
values which are randomly selected by the mating 
point will be exchanged; whereas, if this element is 0, 
the corresponding genes remain the same. For the 
genes in the power distribution and the bandwidth

and remain the same throughout the evolution process 
in this stage. The power distribution part comprises of 
|U| genes, each of which is randomly distributed in  
(0, 1); whereas, the bandwidth allocation part also

e overall complexity required is reduced 
e
j

.
r  urc
comprises of |U| genes, each of which is randomly 
distributed in (0,WT ). 
  The evolution, including the selection, crossover, 
and mutation steps, are similar as those in Sec 3.2, but 
only deal with the power distribution part and the 
bandwidth allo tion part. The above steps will repeat 
until the number of generations meets a pr cribed 
number, say 2G , after which the chromosome with 
the maximum fitness value is chosen. The thi  gene 
values in the power distribution part and the 
bandwidth alloca on part of the t e den
the optimal relaying power and the optimal bandwidth 
allocated to user i , respectively. 
  Note that although the aforementioned 
implementation comprises of two stages, only parts of 
the chromosomes involve in the evolution process. As 
such, it in general requires a smaller population size 
and/or fewer number of generations to converge,

Simulations 
  Some simulations are conducted in this section to 
assess the proposed algorithm. Consider the multi-user 
DF cooperative network addressed in Sec. 2, where the 
total number of relays, |R|, is 4 and th  total number 
of users is |U|. We take the COST-231 model as 
recommended by the IEEE 802.16 working group 
into consideration [20]. All the users are located 
within the circle cellular networks area, centered at 
the BS, in radius 1 kilometer. The relays are placed at 
(200 ± √2, 200 ± √2). All the user’s positions are 
randomly distributed inside the cell. The channels 
from BS to users and f m relays to users are mostly 
used below the rooftop, so such non-line-of-sight 
(NLOS) propagation  fading channels can be 
modeled as Rayleigh random variables with zero-mean 
and unit-variance  The channel model parameters are 
described in Table I of [10]. W denotes the initial 
bandwidth fo each user, the transmitted so e 
power sP  equals 100mWatt, the total power at each 
relay equals rP , and the noise power density is 0N . 
1000 Monte Carlo trials are conducted for each trial.

  We first evaluate the convergence behavior of the

signal at BS at time instant 𝑛 can be expressed as
𝑟(𝑛) =
𝑈∑
𝑢=1
{
𝑒𝑗𝜔𝑢𝑛
𝐿−1∑
𝑙=0
ℎ¯𝑢(𝑙)𝑑𝑢(⟨𝑛− 𝑙⟩𝑁 )
}
+ 𝑔(𝑛) (1)
where ⟨.⟩𝑁 denotes the modulo-𝑁 operator, ℎ¯𝑢(𝑙) is the
complex channel gain of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ path between user 𝑢 and BS,
and 𝑔(𝑛) denotes a complex white Gaussian noise with zero
mean and variance 𝜎2. After a serial-to-parallel convertor and
the removal of CP, and the application of DFT to the received
signal 𝑟(𝑛), the received signal at the 𝑝𝑡ℎ subcarrier symbol
can be represented as [7]
𝑦𝑝 =
𝑈∑
𝑢=1
∑
𝑘∈Ψ𝑢
𝑠𝑢(𝑘)ℎ𝑢(𝑘)𝐼(𝑘, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑢) + 𝑛𝑝
= 𝑠𝑢(𝑝)ℎ𝑢(𝑝)𝐼(𝑝, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑢)
+
∑
𝑘∈Ψ𝑢
𝑘 ∕=𝑝
𝑠𝑢(𝑘)ℎ𝑢(𝑘)𝐼(𝑘, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑢)
+
𝑈∑
𝑤=1
𝑤 ∕=𝑢
∑
𝑘∈Ψ𝑤
𝑠𝑤(𝑘)ℎ𝑤(𝑘)𝐼(𝑘, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑤) + 𝑛𝑝
(2)
where ℎ𝑢(𝑘) and 𝑛𝑝 are the DFT of ℎ¯𝑢(𝑛) and 𝑔(𝑛), re-
spectively, and 𝐼(𝑘, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑢) is the amount of leakage across
subcarriers due to frequency offset, which is given by [7]
I(𝑘, 𝑝, 𝑓𝑢) = 𝑒𝑗𝜋(𝑘−𝑝)
𝑁−1
𝑁
𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜋(𝑘 − 𝑝+ 𝑓𝑢)
𝑁𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜋(𝑘−𝑝+𝑓𝑢)𝑁
(3)
Note that the second and the third terms of (2) represent
ICI and MUI, respectively. Since each of the 𝑁 subcarriers
is only assigned to one user, so 𝑠𝑢(𝑝) is nonzero if the 𝑝𝑡ℎ
subcarrier does belong to user 𝑢, the received signal vector
can then be written as
y = Hs+ n (4)
where y = [𝑦0, 𝑦2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑦𝑁−1]𝑇 , where s =
[𝑠(0), 𝑠(1), ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑠(𝑁 − 1)]𝑇 , 𝑠(𝑘) = 𝑠𝑢(𝑘) if 𝑘 ∈ Ψ𝑢
and H is the corresponding interleaved effective ICI-induced
channel matrix, where H(𝑖, 𝑗) = ℎ𝑢(𝑖)𝐼(𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑓𝑢).
III. PROPOSED DETECTION SCHEME AND
LOW-COMPLEXITY IMPLEMENTATION
A. Oblique Projection Based Detection Scheme
The proposed receiver consists of 𝑁 symbol detectors, as
shown in Fig.1(a). Without loss of generality, we assume that
the detection is processed from the 1𝑠𝑡 to the 𝑁 𝑡ℎ symbols,
each for the transmitted symbol on every subcarrier. For every
symbol, we first compensate the desired subcarrier offset by
the carriers of the other users which are
always misaligned in multiple access system. For this, we
exploit PIC to reduce the effects of CFO by reconstructing the
signals of the other users and then subtracting them from the
received signal. Let y˜𝑝 denote the input to the 𝑝𝑡ℎ detector,
after invoking PIC, we can obtain:
yˆ𝑝 = y˜𝑝 −

where the received symbol dˆ𝑤(𝑘) equals 1 if 𝑦𝑘 ≥ 0, and
equals −1 if 𝑦𝑘 ≤ 0. Thereafter, we conduct SIC, which,
based on (5), can be re-written as
y˘𝑝 = yˆ𝑝 −H(1 : 𝑝− 1)˜s𝑝−1
=h𝑝𝑠𝑝+Ax+ n
(6)
where H(𝑖 : 𝑝) denotes the submatrix of H consisting of its
𝑖𝑡ℎ to the 𝑝𝑡ℎ columns, 𝑠𝑝 denotes the 𝑝𝑡ℎ symbol, h𝑝 denotes
H of the 𝑝𝑡ℎ column, and s˜𝑝−1 = [ 1˜, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , ?˜?−1]𝑇 denotes
the soft-decision output of the (𝑝− 1)𝑡ℎ detector
A = [H(1 : 𝑝− 1) H(𝑝+ 1 : 𝑁)]
x = [e˜𝑝−1 s𝑝+1]
(7)
where e˜𝑝−1 = s𝑝−1 − s˜𝑝−1 denotes the residues of the
decision errors of the previous (𝑝 − 1) symbols, and s𝑝+1 =
[𝑠𝑝+1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑠𝑁 ]𝑇 denotes the undetected symbols.
Note that orthogonality between various competing signal
subspaces is not always attainable. Nevertheless, we can
invoke the oblique projection by exploiting the underlying
structured model such as the one given in (6) to separate the
signals without the orthogonality requirement. Without lots of
generality, assume that the matrices h𝑝 and A both have full
column rank. Then for oblique projection whose range is ⟨h⟩
and whose null space contains ⟨A⟩, the projection matrix is
given by [12], [13]
Eℎ𝐴 = h𝑝(h

where P⊥𝐴 = I −A(A𝐻A)−1A𝐻 . It can be ready to verify
that
Eℎ𝐴h𝑝 = h𝑝 and Eℎ𝐴A = 0 (9)

detection scheme is lower than those of previous works.
IV. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
Consider the uplink of an OFDMA system as discussed
in Sec. II, where the number of subcarriers for each OFDM
symbol block, 𝑁 , is 128. Assume that the channels are fre-
quency selective Rayleigh fading, and there are 𝑈 = 4 active
users simultaneously communicating with the BS in the uplink
systems with the number of resolvable paths for each user, 𝐿,
being 5. Six detection algorithms, including the conventional
MMSE detector [2], CLJL-PIC [6], the decorrelator SIC [7],
SIC-MMSE [4], the subspace decomposition detection (Sub-
dec) [8], and the proposed detection scheme, are conducted for
comparison in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance.
First, we compare the BER performance versus signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) with the (normalized) CFOs being uniformly
