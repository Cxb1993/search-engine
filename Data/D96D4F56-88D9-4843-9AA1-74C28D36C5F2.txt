Greenwood and Williamson [10] pioneered 
the study of frictionless contact between a 
hemisphere and a rigid flat (the GW model) 
applied the Hertz contact solution to model an 
entire contact surface of elastic asperities. To 
supplement the GW model, many 
elastic-plastic asperity models have been 
devised, such as those in [11–15]. Many plastic 
contact models are based on the Abbott and 
Firestone model [16], but neglect volume 
conservation of plastic deformation. Plastic 
contact of surfaces is a fundamental problem in 
the contact mechanics of metal forming. 
During contact, asperity interactions 
combined with adhesion always occur and are 
often the primary cause of friction. The friction 
mechanism must be understood to achieve 
metal forming. Chang et al. [17] applied the 
GW model to an elastic-plastic contact (CEB) 
model to estimate the static friction of two 
rough surfaces in contact. Elastic-plastic finite 
element solutions developed by Kough and 
Etsion [18, 19] for sliding inception of a sphere 
and a rigid flat are applied to predict a better 
static friction coefficient than that predicted by 
Chang et al. [17]. Etsion et al. [20] recently 
conducted an experiment to investigate the 
elastic-plastic contact area and static friction of 
a deformable sphere on a rigid flat. Brizmera et 
al. [21] theoretically analyzed the behavior of 
an elastic–plastic contact between a deformable 
sphere and a rigid flat under combined normal 
and tangential loading with full stick contact 
condition. Ovcharenko et al. [22] 
experimentally studied the elastic-plastic 
contact between a deformable sphere and a 
rigid flat during pre-sliding. Cohen et al. [23] 
studied the elastic-plastic spherical contact of 
rough surfaces under combined normal and 
tangential loading with full stick contact 
condition. 
The friction coefficient is a key input 
boundary condition in numerical calculation 
and process simulation of plastic deformation 
during metal forming processes that are 
sensitive to friction. However, a proper friction 
coefficient is very difficult to obtain during 
metal forming simulation. No theoretical 
method currently exists for determining the 
friction coefficient when any two materials are 
in sliding contact. Although considerable effort 
has been expended to understand the friction 
mechanism, accurate quantitative predictions 
of friction coefficients are not yet possible. 
However, conceptual understanding of the 
friction process is now essential to accurate 
estimation of friction coefficient. 
The contribution of this work is the 
mathematical representation of friction under 
dry friction for practical and analytical 
applications. The constant friction coefficient 
of the Amonton-Coulomb friction model, the 
most popular and simplest input data used 
extensively in process simulation of metal 
forming, is applied in this study. An extended 
model, including material properties and 
surface contact characteristics, is proposed on a 
model of a hemispherical contact against a 
rigid flat. A fractional profile of an ellipsoid is 
utilized to describe the deformed shape of a 
hemisphere; the real contact area ratio is 
defined simultaneously. Additionally, an 
adhesion factor is defined to measure the 
junction ability of asperity contact. We assume 
the friction process is a series of contact states 
changing from fracture to pure shearing. The 
effects of several factors are examined using 
the proposed friction model. 
 
三、基本分析 
Figure 1 describes schematically the 
contact processes of rough surfaces during 
metal forming. In the contact layer, the 
hardened and polished tool surface is replaced 
by a rigid flat, and the raw and rough surface of 
a deformable material, asperity, is replaced 
with a deformable hemisphere with its base 
firmly fixed to the workpiece surface. 
Therefore, a single asperity contact model can 
be generally approached in this manner. In the 
processes of compression (Figs. 1(a)–(c)), the 
shape of the deformed hemisphere is 
approximated to a fractional ellipsoid 
distribution to facilitate an analytical solution, 
which is a key feature of this work. 
Additionally, the deformed hemisphere 
becomes a cylinder (Fig. 1(c)) in the final stage 
based on the constant volume law of plasticity. 
The conventional adhesion theory, the first 
modern explanation of friction, was developed 
by Bowden and Tabor [24]. The theory posits 
that contact adhesion during surface interaction 
causes friction resistance in which the 
combined effect of normal pressure and shear 
stress is considered at the contact area of an 
asperity junction. In this work, the constant 
friction coefficient, such as Amonton-Coulomb 
friction law extensively used in numerical

During the final stage, the deformed 
hemisphere changed into a cylinder, implying 
that the stress state will change into a 
hydrostatic stress state of compression. Under 
this condition, the final cylinder shape 
(radius, ; height, ) at  will 
not be compressed further because of the 
constraints resulting from the adjacent 
hemispheres on the periphery of deformed 
hemisphere (Fig. 1).

The full contact state is defined as a

hydrostatic stress state of compression in 
which only slipping via shearing can be 
induced by the cylinder shape. 
 
3-3. Mean contact pressure and 
compressive load 
At a certain level of interference h, we 
assume compressive stress induced by the 
contact area is a mean contact pressure. 
Additionally, the compressed hemisphere is 
simplified as an axial symmetrical stress 
element. Under the constant volume law and

Thus,  can continue increasing until rp

friction stress remains constant because a 
hydrostatic stress state always occurred 
( 3/1)/( max0 =Rh ), but contact pressure  
increased. Therefore, the friction coefficient 
will begin decreasing with contact pressure 
until

This discussion demonstrates the complex 
relationships among , max0 )/( Rh )/( urp σ , cα  
and n. 
 
四、結果與討論 
The proposed model, a deformable 
hemisphere contacts against a rigid flat, for 
evaluating friction coefficient μ  is discussed 
as follows. 
 
4-1. The profile of a deformable 
hemisphere against a rigid flat  
The profile of a deformable hemisphere 
against a rigid flat is assumed as a fractional 
shape of an ellipsoid described by Eq. (9). 
Figure 7 shows the profile of the deformed 
hemisphere with  from 0 (as a 
hemisphere) to 1/3 (as a cylinder). The 
predicted profile of deformed hemisphere is 
very similar to the FE simulation results, such 
as the results by Jackson and Green [15] (Figs. 
7 and 10), in which they are all the quadratic 
forms. 
0/ Rh
 
4-2. The contact area ratio ar AA /=α : 
The contact area ratio, α , defined by Eq. 
(13) is utilized to measure the shearing effect 
under normal contact. Figure 8 shows the 
contact area ratio, α , increases significantly as 
the interference ratio, , increases, which 
shows a slightly increasing rate. In the final 
stage of compressive loading, 
0/ Rh
α  will 
approach unity when  equals 1/3; it 0/ Rh
D for n = 0.35 and point C for n = 0.55. Thus, 
 will remain constant for a 
hydrostatic stress condition induced 
subsequently; however, compressive loading 
can be subsequently increased to maximum 
contact stress, 
max0 )/( Rh
urp σ= , which is shown by 
point E as n = 0.35 and 0.55. At this moment, 
the friction coefficients will decrease to a 
constant 3/1  under the conditions of 1=α , 
3/1=aC  and 1)/( =urp σ . For the case of 
n = 0.18232 shown in line OE, it is a special 
case in that the friction coefficient will directly 
increase to 3/1 , which is a sticking state. 
Finally, a comparison of friction coefficient 
between an experiment conducted by Hassan 
Mohamed et al. [26] and the calculated value 
of the proposed model is shown in Fig. 12. It is 
found that the calculated value is larger than 
that determined experimentally. This 
overestimation may result from the increasing 
rates of the contact area ratio differ from the 
decreasing rates in other contact experiments, 
such as that by Wanheim and Bay [27] (Figs. 
13 and 16) and Bay et al. [28] (Figs. 4 and 9). 
 
4-6. The constraint of this contact 
modeling: 
From Eqs. (32) and (35), n = 0.18232 is 
found as a critical value. For n < 0.18232, the 
contact area ratio cannot reach full contact, i.e. 
1=α , because the contact pressure first 
reaches tensile stress before full contact. This 
is in contrast to the case of n > 0.18232. 
Equation (33) shows the relationship between 
 and n and Eq. (34) shows the 
relationship between critical contact area ratio 
max0 )/( Rh
cα  and n. Both  and max0 )/( Rh cα  increase 
as n increases until n = 0.18232 (Fig. 13). 
These values will always remain constant, 
 and 3/1)/( max0 =Rh 1=cα , as n > 0.18232. 
Notably, the process factors interact in such 
a complex manner that they cannot be strictly 
considered in isolation. Although additional 
experience is needed, some practical 
conclusions are possible to further the 
understanding of the friction mechanism. 
 
五、成果自評 
This work presents an evaluation of the 
friction coefficient for a model in which a rigid 
flat contacts a deformable hemisphere. The 
following is a list of primary conclusions. 
(1)The profile of a deformable hemisphere 
against a rigid flat is assumed to be the shape 
underneath an ellipsoid, significantly 
reducing the complexity in describing a 
deformed shape during compressive loading. 
However, the interference ratio, , 
should be less than 1/3. Clearly, the 
deformed hemisphere becomes a cylinder 
and a hydrostatic stress state is induced at 
the critical condition of  (or 
0/ Rh
3/1/ 0 =Rh
1=α ). The profile of deformed hemisphere 
agrees with FE simulation results, such as 
those obtained by Jackson and Green [15] 
(Figs. 7 and 10), in which all shapes have a 
quadratic form. 
(2)The contact area ratio, α , significantly 
increases as the interference ratio, , 
increases with a slightly increasing rate in 
this model. This trend agrees with 
experimental observations obtained by 
Etsion et al. [20] (Fig. 4) and the theoretical 
simulations such as those by Kught and 
Etsion [13] (Fig. 8) and Jackson and Green 
[15] (Fig. 3). 
0/ Rh
(3)The compressive load is proposed as a 
function of the interference ratio, , and 
strain hardening exponent n. As n < 0.18232, 
the normalized load  peaks before 
 approaches 1/3. Conversely, as n > 
0.18232, the normalized load is always less 
than  as  approaches 1/3. 
Subsequently, 
0/ Rh
mF
0/ Rh
nn 0/ Rh
max00 )/(3/1/ RhRh ==  will 
always keep invariable and then a 
hydrostatic stress state is induced; however, 
compressive loading can still increase to the 
critical condition such that contact stress 
reaches uσ   prior to surface fracture. 
(4)A proposed adhesion factor  is used to 
measure the junction ability of asperities 
contact; the range of which is 1–
aC
3/1 . 
Clearly, 1=aC  is induced by an infinitely 
small contact (full junction or complete 
deformation energy concentration) at 
0→α , which is a fracture case in the 
proposed model. As 3/1=aC  is induced 
by full contact (a complete shearing state) at 
1== cαα , which is a pure shearing case of 
sticking. 
(5)A critical value of n is found such that the 
contact state cannot reach full contact ( 1=α )
