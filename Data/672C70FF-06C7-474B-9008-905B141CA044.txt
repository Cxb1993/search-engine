1. 前言 
 
As more and more computers and commercial devices communicate with each other 
either by wired or wireless connections, this revolution has led to the increasing data 
traffic in networks. As the availability of high-speed internet, the cloud computing 
services are being provided to corporate and individual users. These applications, that 
require a lot of bandwidths, become more and more popular, and this trend is set to 
continue. The need to support high bandwidth traffic then requires the performance of 
internet routers and switches to grow drastically.  
 
Most switches in the current market are based on the shared memory switch 
architecture, one of the output-buffered switches [1]. In this architecture, packets are 
stored and forwarded in a common shared memory. As the speed of fiber optics 
advances, the memory access speed becomes a bottleneck (scalability problem). If the 
line rate is R, the N x N common shared memory has to deal with at most 2 ∙
 
N ∙ R 
rate in the same time. To achieve higher speed, one has to use parallel-buffered switch 
architectures to acquire the needed speedup. One common approach, known as the 
input buffered switch architecture, is to have parallel buffers in front of a switch fabric 
[2]. 
 
 
An input-buffered switch, with each input maintaining a single first in first out (FIFO) 
queue, may suffer head-of-line (HOL) blocking problem and then result in 
degradation in throughput down to 58% [3]. One way to solve this problem is known 
as the virtual output queuing (VOQ) technique, which maintains a separate queue for 
each output at each input. As there are N
2
 buffers (memories) at the inputs of an N xN 
switch fabric, the key problem of input-buffered switches (equipped with VOQs) is to 
apply a certain matching algorithm to choose (at most) N of N
2
 HOL packets to 
transmit through the switch fabric [3]-[9]. To the best of our knowledge, computation 
complexity of these algorithms is at least O(N
3
). To do this, a switch not only needs to 
gather the information of the virtual output queues at the inputs, but also uses the 
gathered information to compute a matching. However, matching algorithms for 
conflict resolution require extra computation and communication overheads in every 
time slot, and these result in another scalability issue. Furthermore, matching 
algorithms can not guarantee 100% throughput theoretically without the speedup of 
two because using maximal matching algorithm such as PIM [4] and SLIP [2] can 
only achieve about 50% throughput [1].

2. 研究目的與文獻探討 
 
With this important feature (100% throughput), the LB-BvN switch is one of the best 
architectures for implementing the next generation tera-bit switch. However, one 
drawback of the LB-BvN switch is the out-of-sequence issue. Packets in the flow of 
the same input to the same output might be out of order due to multi-path created by 
the load balancing stage. Recently, most researches focus on resolving the out-of 
sequence issue in this two-stage switch architecture [11]-[13]. The concept of 
feedback-based path in this two-stage system then is introduced in mailbox algorithm 
[11]. Then, CR switch [12] combines the ideas of frame-based switch and mailbox 
switch. Feedback-based scheduling switch [13] furthermore extends this idea to create 
the different feedback path in the two stages. These methods use a set of connection 
patterns to create a feedback path for packet departure time. With the information of 
packet departure time, the system can schedule packets so that they depart in the order 
of their arrivals. 
 
 
5 
` 
 
3) Design of the pattern generator by using only two DFFs to replace the O(N 3) 
matching algorithm. 
 
The rest of this work is organized as follows. In Section 3.1, design motivation and 
the analysis of propagation delay and throughput is given. Then, we introduce two 
special connection patterns for creating feedback path in Section 3.2 . The overall 
system architecture design of the LB-BvN switch and the detail circuit design 
techniques to boost switching speed are presented in Section 4.1. Especially, we 
present the concept of parallel distribution of the pattern generation block into each 
basis 4 × 4 switch, in which only two DFFs are used. In Section 5.1, the measurement 
results and the system simulation results of the proposed LB-BvN 4×4 switch fabric 
IC are provided. Finally, we give a short conclusion in Section 5.2 .

` 
 
 
The performance of feedback-based two-stage switch system depends on the 
round-trip time (RTT) of transmitting packet departure information. Figure 3(b) shows 
the RTT of the feedback-path that include the packet time, propagation delay from the 
load-balancing stage to the VOQs (physical delay), delay in the VOQs (physical 
delay), propagation delay from the VOQs to the switching stage (physical delay). 
After scaling up, the feedback-based system might degrade the system throughput 
9 
` 
To solve this problem, one straight forward strategy is to ﬁll up the idle time (shown 
in the left side of Fig. 3(b)) in the RTT by sending more packets (as shown in Fig. 
3(c)).When the RTT is r times of packet transmission time, we send r packets to ﬁll 
up the idle time. We call this as the pipeline method. The dashed line in Fig. 4 shows 
that the throughput rate verses different RTT ratio under the pipeline method. The 
improvement of the pipeline method is limited in the mailbox algorithm simulation. 
Every input port can send only one packet in average to a speciﬁc destination port 
even for the pipeline case because the FIFO input buffers block multiple packets in the 
line card. 
 
Furthermore, the throughput degradation problem becomes severe when switch 
system scaling up. We use a 4 × 4 switch as a module to construct a high order switch 
as shown in Fig. 5. An LB-BvN N ×  N switch needs (N/4) × log4 N 4 × 4 switches. In 
a feedback-based switch system, 2 × (N/4) ×  log4 N SerDes are needed, and it means 2 
× log4 N SerDes propagation delay that will be introduced to the feedback-based 
system. The throughput simulation after scaling up is shown in Fig. 6, and this ﬁgure 
demonstrates the throughput degradation problem when propagation delay are 1, 2, 
and 4 times of the packet transmission time. The throughput degradation results are 
compared to the ideal case (without any propagation delay). It is important to reduce 
the propagation delay especially in a feedback-based system with numerous 
input/output ports. In Section 4.1, we present a scalable LB-BvN switch fabric IC 
directly in high speed domain to reduce the propagation delay that is introduced by 
SerDes interfaces and the DSP core.

An LB-BvN N × N switch is constructed by using (N/2)×log2 N 2×2 switches. The 
STDM connection pattern of each 2 × 2 switch depends on its position in the LB-BvN 
N × N switch module and the current time slot. The position of a 2 × 2 switch is 
deﬁned by the column index l and row index m (l, m) as shown in Fig. 5. The column 
index l of each 2×2 switch is deﬁned from right to left as 1, 2, ..., log2 N and the row 
index m is deﬁned from top to bottom as 1, 2, ..., N/2. The STDM connection pattern 
of the m
th
 switch of the l
th
 stage at time t for a 2 × 2 switch can be determined by Eq. 
(2) and Eq. (3) [11]. 
 
 
 
                                     Ψ          
                   
    
                                          
where 
                                                                                                             
 
 
We set the bar connection pattern if Eq. (2) equals to zero, and set the cross 
connection pattern otherwise. Table I shows the STDM connection pattern for each 2 
13 
` 
switch system using staggered ordering algorithm [13]. The input i connected to the 
middle stage j and the middle stage j connected to the output k on the t
th
 time slot 
follow two rules below (Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) [13]): 
 
        j = (i + t)    mod N                      (4) 
 
k = (j + N − 1 − t)    mod N                  (5) 
 
The staggered symmetric 4 × 4 connection patterns are demonstrated in Fig. 7(b). The 
staggered symmetric connection patterns provides another kind of feedback path that 
different from STDM connection patterns. According to [13], the feedback 
information from VOQs to output ports (line cards) is passed through the previous 
cycle switching pattern. The line cards use the information, just renewed, to decide 
which packets can be sent to the VOQs. For example, ordering information through 
the t = 4n + 1 staggered symmetric connection pattern of the switching stage to the 
output ports helps the next cycle (t = 4n + 2) input ports send packets to the VOQs. It 
can be applied in systems using staggered ordering algorithms [13]. However, these 
connection patterns are different in the load balancing stage and switching stage so 
that reconﬁgurable design is needed. The pattern generator design details are in next 
section. The staggered symmetric connection patterns in every 2×2 switch are shown 
in Fig. 8(b)and (c). Table I shows the staggered symmetric connection patterns for 
each 2 × 2 switch and the relations between the STDM connection patterns and the 
staggered symmetric connection patterns.

The method 1) directly implements math equations (2) and(3) that deal with 
power-of-two modulus divisions and many time consuming arithmetic operations, 
such as the addition and subtraction. In the method 2), equations are expanded in 
advance and then all states have to be memorized in considerable registers. Actually, 
connection patterns expressed by Eq. (2) are periodic. After observing the behavior of 
all states expanded by Eq. (2), the third method is proposed and only two DFFs are 
necessary for constructing an LB-BvN 4×4 switch module. 
 
 
In the LB-BvN 4 × 4 switch (as Fig. 8(a), (b) ,and (c)), we can index the four 2 × 2 
17 
` 
the tracking pair transistors degrade the required minimum small-signal gain for 
proper tracking operation. Therefore, the tail current source must be sufﬁciently high 
to achieve a wider range of linearity and a larger trans-conductance. On the other hand, 
the holding pair does not need a large bias current at ultrahigh-frequencies [21]. 
19 
` 
The CML output interface, that consists of two-stage CML buffers, is shown in Fig. 
12(a). In the ﬁrst stage, we use our patent of PMOS active load inductive peaking 
technique [24]-[25] to improve the operating speed. In the last stage, we propose the 
active back-end termination for impedance match of the 50 Ω load. 
 
The traditional CML output interface uses resistor loads between supply voltage 
(VDD) and output pairs. To improve the operating bandwidth, one can choose the 
on-chip inductors to replace resistors. However, on-chip inductors occupy largest chip 
area and introduce signiﬁcant parasitic capacitance. In our design, we use PMOS 
active load inductive peaking technique [24]-[25] in the ﬁrst stage of CML output 
interface to enhance the bandwidth. It includes active inductors formed by PMOS 
transistors (M9-M10) that act as active resistors connected to NMOS transistors load 
(M7-M8). They act as the on-chip inductors to employ inductive-peaking. Compared 
to on-chip inductors, active inductors require much lower chip area and consume less 
power to achieve the same frequency response. We also incorporate negative Miller 
capacitance (M3-M4) to meet high-speed requirement. 
 
 
 
 
21 
` 
passive back-end termination. As comparing with AC-coupled active back-end 
termination, it occupies less chip area due to no need for on-chip capacitor. The CML 
output interface is suitable for 10 Gbps design to drive the 50 Ω load environment so 
we adopt it in our design. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
23 
` 
Eye diagrams of one channel output for different data rates are shown in Fig. 17(a)-(c) 
respectively. The peak-to-peak jitter (Jitterpp ) are 10 ps at 5 Gbps, 14 ps at 7 Gbps, 
and 20 ps at 8 Gbps. 
 
 
 
 
 
The data switching rate of the proposed LB-BvN 4 × 4 switch is 32 Gbps (8 
Gbps/channel). The overall propagation delay of the switch is only 0.8 ns, and we 
provide the system throughput performance analysis in next subsection. Table II 
shows the comparison with our previous works. The type-I switch in [17] and the 
type-II switch in [18] are implemented with different SerDes interface structures. This 
proposed LB-BvN 4 × 4 switch fabric IC outperforms our previous works because the 
circuit is without the delay overhead of SerDes interfaces and is implemented directly 
in high speed domain. 
25 
` 
 
 
27 
` 
 
Fig. 18 shows the throughput simulation based on measured propagation delay (see 
Table II) when the LB-BvN switch scales from 4×4 to 256×256. The system 
throughput of switch system using proposed LB-BvN 4×4 switch fabric IC modules 
can achieve about 80% in size of 4 × 4 switch system. While the switch system scale 
up to 256×256, system throughput can still maintain about 60%. However, the 
throughput reduces to 1.64% when the switch ports are 256 with SerDes propagation 
delay 100 ns. The ideal case (without any propagation delay) is also shown in Fig. 18 
for comparison. Therefore, it is important to reduce the propagation delay especially 
in a feedback-based system with huge number of input/output ports. In this paper, we 
present a scalable LB-BvN switch fabric IC directly in high speed domain to reduce 
the propagation delay that is introduced by SerDes interfaces and the DSP core. 
 
 
 
5.2  Conclusion 
 
In feedback-based LB-BvN switch systems, the propagation delay of whole system 
becomes an important issue because the packets in the switch system have to wait 
feedback information for ordering. The system throughput degrades when the 
propagation delay is getting longer especially in systems with numerous input/output 
ports. In this paper, an LB-BvN 4 × 4 switch fabric IC is proposed for feedback-based 
switch system to solve the throughput degradation problem, and the system 
throughput performance analysis is also provide to support our idea. This work is 
fabricated in 0.13 µm CMOS technology and the chip area is 1.380 × 1.080 mm

In this subproject, we have completed the following task. 
1) Design and implementation of a low propagation delay 4x4 switch fabric IC for 
a feedback-based switch System to improve throughput. 
2) Analysis of the relation between the propagation delay and the switch system 
throughput. 
3) Design of the pattern generator by using only two DFFs to replace the O(N3) 
matching  
algorithm. 
A load balanced Birkhoff-von Neumann (LB-BvN) 4 x4 switch fabric IC is proposed 
for   
feedback-based switch system. This work is fabricated in 0.13 um CMOS technology 
and the chip area is 1:380 x 1:080 mm^2. The overall data switching rate of the 
LB-BvN 4 x4 switch fabric IC is up to 32 Gbps (8Gbps/channel) with only 0.8 ns
