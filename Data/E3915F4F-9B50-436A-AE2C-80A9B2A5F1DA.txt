Figs. 5 and 6 show the HRTEM images of two typical 
clustered samples. Fig. 5 shows that of a gallium-rich 
InGaN thin film and Fig. 6 shows that of an 
InGaN/GaN QW sample emitting yellow PL.

4. Emission Enhancement through Surface 
Plasmonic Crystals 
Recently, we fabricated silver surface plasmonic 
crystals on a single InGaN/GaM QW sample with 
different 2-D metallic grating structures. We observed 
the enhancement of spontaneous emission measured 
from the backside. Fig. 7 shows an SEM image of a 
surface plasmonic crystal with silver islands of 600 nm 
in period. Fig. 8 shows the enhancement of emission 
when compared with the reference sample of no silver 
coating. The enhancement of the 500-nm crystal is 
nearly three times. The crystals of other periods also 
enhance the backside emission. We are currently 
measuring the PL decay times to confirm that the 
enhancement is indeed due to the coupling of surface 
plasmons.

5. Non-degenerate fs pump-probe spectroscopy 
This research group has invented a novel method for 
efficient fsec non-degenerate pump-probe experiments. 
Such experiments can be used for understanding the 
carrier dynamics in InGaN, particularly the carrier 
recombination mechanisms of such a material with 
nanostructures. This less expensive method utilizes two 
β-BBO crystals for individually generating the second 
harmonics of a Ti:sapphire laser for the pump and 
probe. In particular, the probe spectrum can be 
designed to be quite broad (60 nm so far, can be even 
broader) for monitoring the time-resolved spectrum. 
Fig. 9 shows the second-harmonic generation (SHG) 
spectra with various crystal orientations, showing the 
coverage of the pump-probe spectral range by using a 
10 fsec Ti:sapphire laser. Fig. 10 shows the 
non-degenerate pump-probe traces, i.e., time-resolved 
differential transmission intensity profiles, with the 
pump at 390 nm and probes at various probe 
wavelengths. A gallium-rich InGaN thin film was used 
for this experiment.
