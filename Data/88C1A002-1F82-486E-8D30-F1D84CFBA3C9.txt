III. WAVELET-BASED WATERMARK EMBEDDING 
Suppose that the J-th level DWT [6] is performed at a host 
image  with the size 2  Herein, the achromatic 
component of the color image is represented by

The gross approximation 0, ( , )Jf m n  represents the image 
approximation at resolution J . The i-th frequency orientation 
at the j-th resolution level of the host image  is 
denoted by

where m n×  is equal to the total number of wx wyM N×  that is 
the dimension of the watermark. Notice that all the pixels in 
the watermark w  are permuted by a pseudorandom order to 
produce the permuted watermark  that is then duplicated 
into four copies, .

To improve the perceptual invisibility, we modify the 
watermark shuffle approach of Hsu et al. [7] for hiding the 
grayscale watermarks and called the approach of pixel-based 
adaptive shuffle (PBAS). The PBAS is operated by shuffling 
each pixel of the watermark  into its spatial position 
according to the corresponding sorting order of the

 After the watermark embedding process of (10), four 
watermarks are individually embedded into the third level 
subbands of DWT domain.  By using the inverse DWT of 
three levels to reconstruct the achromatic image  in (8), the 
watermarked achromatic image is represented by

f . Then, to 
redirect the watermark from the achromatic component into the 
saturation component can be achieved by applying the 
saturation watermarking technique described in (7). 
IV.  WATERMARK EXTRACTION PROCEDURES 
The first step of extracting the corrupted achromatic 
image is to simultaneously convert the original color image 
and the corrupted watermarked image from RGB space into 
IHS space. Then, the saturation component S  and the 
intensity component I  in the original image and the 
saturation component S  in the corrupted watermarked image 
are used to calculate 

f  which is the corrupted version of f . 
By referring to the relationship of  and  [4] and saturation 
watermarking in (7), 
S S
f  can be obtained by
