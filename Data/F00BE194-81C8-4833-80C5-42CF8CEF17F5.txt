第 47 屆 DAC 設計自動化會議 
出國報告 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                       服務單位：國立成功大學資訊工程學系 
                       姓名職稱：林英超 助理教授 
                       會議地點：美國加州 
                       出國期間：99 年 6 月 13 日至 18 日 
                       報告日期： 
 
 
 
壹、 前言 
 
  國際設計自動化會議(Design Automation Conference; DAC)是電子設計與自
動化(Electronic Design Automation; EDA)領域中頗富盛名的國際大型研討會，此
會議議程中囊括了最新的研究技術內容以及該領域之商業交流活動。今年的
DAC 為期六天，從6月13日到 6月18 日，於美國加州Anaheim市舉行。期間共
舉辦五場教學會議(tutorial)，六場討論會議(workshop) 以及超過五十場科技座談
會(technical session)。此外，DAC的另一個特色是舉辦exhibition、User Track、IC 
Design Central Partner Pavilion等議程，由業界公司來介紹近期技術開發成果與最
新解決方案，使與會者可以透過demo suite來得到最新的tool 的訊息，也可以跟
參展廠商討論最新的問題或是發展的趨勢。 
  
二、研討會重要內容摘要 
 
Session：Thermal tracking, monitoring and characterization 
Chair：Seda Ogerenci Memik 
  此會議是屬於 Low-Power Design 的範疇，主要內容是探討計算機系統的熱
現象(thermal phenomena)，這次會議主要的論文是研究此領域中的三個問題。第
一篇論文敘述的是如何追蹤高性能系統中溫度變化的技術，並就其傳感器的分配
技術與特徵詳細說明；第二篇論文探討如何預測並控制運行中通過相位檢測的熱
量；最後一篇論文的重點為優化熱感器的分配。 
 
Session：Interconnect networks：Present and Future 
Chair：Li Shang 
  此會議是屬於 System-Level and Embedded 的範疇，主要是發表互連網路的
最新研究。前兩篇論文是就 3D 互連網路做一個全面性的省視，第三篇論文則是
描述一個以奈米光子連繫的多核心系統。最後兩篇論文則是敘述傳統互連的架構，
其中第四篇論文將虛擬通道與多個實體網路做比較，而最後一篇論文則是解釋一
個高效能動態可重組的晶片型網路架構。 
 
Session：Reliability and integrity of circuits and systems 
Chair：Sudeep Pasricha 
  此次的會議是屬於 System-Level and Embedded 的範疇，主要的焦點是利用
新方法確保電路及系統的可靠性和完整性。第一篇論文開發了一個新的熱試驗，
藉由偵測可能的木馬，來確保後矽晶片電路的整合性；第二篇論文介紹一個新的
誤差注入工具來驗證系統級的整合性；最後一篇論文發表了一個新的系統級可靠
的分析法，藉由早期量化技術及 SAT 輔助模擬去控制 BDD 的大小。 
 
Session：Panel：3-D stacked die：now or the future？ 
Chair：Andrew Yang 
  此次會議是屬於 Physical Design 的範疇。儘管傳統摩爾定律仍持續前進，可
是卻呈現放慢的趨勢，因此愈來愈多業者試圖打破摩爾定律，封裝技術即是一個
未來新發展方向。利用矽穿孔封裝(TSV)來進行 3-D 封裝提供了比線接合架構更
短的路徑與更低的電阻及電感，由於TSV是在每一個矽晶圓上以蝕刻方式鑽孔，
使其能通過每一層晶片，再以導電材料如銅等物質填滿而形成一通道來做連接的
功能，將所有晶片結合為一。然而，TSV 連結方法與配置必須非常精確，因此
關於 TSV 裝配問題，特別是在 SiP 的應用上，仍是未來須努力的方向。
