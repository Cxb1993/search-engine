英文摘要  
Speaking rate is one of the most important factors in spontaneous speech 
systems, because variability in speaking rate may be often observed in spontaneous 
speech than in read speech. It is difficult to incorporate the findings into a quantitative 
model. Therefore, there has been rather few prosodic model devoted to investigating 
detailed effects of speech rate modification on the realization of individual pitch 
accents, duration, intonation, and prosodic structures. The focus is on the effect of 
speaking rate on segmental duration structure. The achievement is useful for 
improving the quality of speech synthesis and the recognition rate of speech 
recognition.

1.4 研究方法  
語料庫是語言語音分析合成的基礎，沒有恰當的語料庫，很多語音現象都
無法被觀察。本計劃採用一個以不同速度錄製之語音資料庫。此資料庫分為慢
速、中速及快速三種。我們利用此不同速度的語音資料庫來觀察統計不同速度下
語音音素的音長結構細部變化。 
首先，我們針對不同速度的語料進行音長模型的建置，以了解不同語速下
音長模型的變化。我們在音長模型中選取了一些重要的因素，將其對韻律參數的
影響，以調變參數 (companding factors) 之方式導入韻律模式中，而採用期望最
大化 (EM, Expectation-Maximization) 演算法來預估這些參數的值。 
考慮之影響因素包括韻律狀態 (prosodic state)、音檔編號、聲調、及基本音
節(base-syllable)等，此處之韻律狀態是指聲音單元處於一個韻律片語中之狀態，
它用以吸納詞以上語言參數之影響。因為資料庫中無此資訊，視為隱藏的韻律狀
態(hidden prosodic state)。音檔編號之列入主要是用以正規化各錄音檔之速度。 
我們的音長模型介紹如下。當我們假設所有影響因素的作用為相加，我們
可以將音長的模型表為 
+n n p
p
Z X    
其中 nZ 為第 n個單元的原始音長， nX 為去除所有因素的影響後的第 n個單
元的音長。我們將 nX 模型化為一個常態分佈，其平均值為，其變異值為 v。
p 代表影響因素 p的權重；p為韻律狀態、音檔編號、聲調、及基本音節。 
在期望最大化演算法中，我們定義輔助函數(auxiliary function)為

Abstract - An F0 (Fundamental Frequency) Control Model for 
Singing Synthesis is proposed. The F0 control model is based on 
a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller to control a 
second-order transfer function to generate overshoot and 
preparation fluctuations. The parameters of the PID controller 
and the second-order transfer function can be tuned to generate 
natural F0 fluctuations. The F0 control model effectively 
improved the naturalness of synthesized singing-voice. 
 
Keywords - singing synthesis, F0 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Speech and singing are both important ways to 
communicate and present emotion. But the characteristics 
of singing voice are different from speech. For example, in 
singing, vowels are articulated over a wider range of pitch 
frequencies [1]. The intelligibility of the phonetic message 
is often secondary to the intonation and musical qualities of 
the voice. The ratio of voiced to unvoiced sounds is 
typically much greater for the singing voice than for a 
speaking voice.  
For singing-voice synthesis, there are several synthesis 
methods proposed, e.g. Physical model [2], Formant-based 
synthesis [3], Formant wave functions (FOF) [4], 
Sinusoidal-based singing synthesis [5], and Harmonic plus 
noise model [6]. 
However, the naturalness of the synthesized speech and 
singing-voice also depends on the F0 (Fundamental 
Frequency) contour deeply. When singing a song, one sings 
and expresses lyrics by changing notes according to the 
melody of the score. However the score only defines how 
to sing a song, the natural prosody and the characteristics of 
a human’s singing also needs to be considered. The F0 
contour using in singing synthesis is usually absolute values 
of stepwise pitch from musical notes. That is, synthesized 
singing often is an interpretation of a predefined musical 
score. Though there are many f0 control models proposed 
for speech synthesis, they cannot be used to control and 
generate the F0 contours of a singing-voice directly. 
Therefore, an F0 control model for singing synthesis is 
needed. 
There are several studies about the F0 of singing. 
Sundberg [7] shows that during the note transition, the 
response time in F0 risings was longer than that in F0 
fallings by measuring the F0 speed changes. According to 
[8], the F0 contours include several types of fluctuations, 
such as overshoot, preparation, vibrato and fine-
fluctuations. These fluctuations are important to singing-
voice characteristics. Overshoot is deflection exceeding the 
target note after note changes; preparation is a deflection in 
the opposite direction of a note change observed just before 
the note changes [8]. Moreover, there are fine fluctuations 
that affect the naturalness of singing-voice’s F0 contours. 
Fine-fluctuation is irregularly fluctuation higher than 10 Hz; 
the modulation frequency contained frequency component 
up to 20 Hz and the modulation amplitudes are 20 cent on 
average and 100 cent at maximum [8]. Vibrato is the quasi-
periodic modulation of F0. The vibrato characteristics tend 
to be more constant in professional singers’ voice [8]. The 
rate of vibrato, for example, is reported to be between 5.2 
to 7.8 Hz whereas the vibrato extent figures go from 0.03 to 
1.57 semitones in Sertanejo Singing Style [9]. This is not 
significantly different from the figures presented for lyrical 
singing vibrato in the literature.  
The goal of this paper is to build an F0 control model 
that can generate the natural F0 contours for Taiwanese 
singing synthesis. To generate the natural transition and 
fluctuations of F0, a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) 
controller used to control a second-order transfer function 
is proposed.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents 
the F0 control model based on PID controller. Section 3 
introduces the singing corpus and the observation of the 
fluctuation phenomenon in corpus.  Section 4 shows the 
experimental results. Conclusions are given in the last 
section. 
 
2. F0 CONTROL MODEL 
 
In this paper, a PID controller is used to control a second-
order transfer function to generate the fluctuations. The PID 
controller is described in this section. The F0 control model 
and the parameter setting will also be discussed.  
 
2.1. PID Controller 
 
A PID controller [10] is a control loop feedback mechanism 
widely used in control systems. PID controller has several 
benefits, for example, it is simple, adaptive and robust. 
However, PID has a weakness, if it fails to control a 
process, then no matter how to adjust the parameters of PID,

At last, the value of parameter K  of second order-
damping model is tuned to control the extent of overshoot 
and preparation fluctuations.  
 
3. SINGING CORPUS AND F0 FLUCTUATIONS 
 
3.1. Singing Corpus 
 
The 31 songs of the singing corpus used in this study are 
selected from Taiwanese children songs. They were 
recorded in data formats of 96-KHz sampling rate and 24-
bit accuracy. The singers include four adults (two males 
and two females) and three female second grade students of 
an elementary school. Among the four adults, one male 
singer was chorus member; the others are preferred because 
they have a better sense of rhythm and pitch. Three 
elementary school students are selected and tutored by an 
elementary school music teacher. The amount of songs and 
sentences of lyrics for each singer are shown in Table 3.  
The musical scores of the corpus were stored in MIDI 
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) format. Anvil Studio 
was adopted to input the scores and generate MIDI files. 
The F0 of the score notes can be extracted from the MIDI 
files. 
 
3.2. Analysis of F0 fluctuations 
 
Fig. 3 shows an example original F0 contour of a recording 
singing voice. The vertical axis indicates frequency in Hz 
and the horizontal axis indicates time in second. A stepwise 
note transition contour is also shown. It’s clear from the 
figure that the natural F0 contour doesn’t fit the stepwise 
contour; on the contrary, it has lots of fluctuations.  
From many research works which have been 
presented, there are four kinds of fluctuations in singing, 
including    overshoot,    preparation,    vibrato,    and    fine

indicates   that   three   of   them  -  overshoot,  vibrato,  and 
preparation - strongly affect singing-voice perception, and 
overshoot has the greatest effect. 
Although there are many reports describing vibrato as 
an important singing-voice characteristic, in Taiwanese 
children’s songs, it is not that obvious to find vibrato, no 
matter in the observation of F0 contour or hearing. This is 
because   Children’s   songs   generally   do  not  emphasize
