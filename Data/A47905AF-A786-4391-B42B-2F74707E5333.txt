Abstract 
The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a novel adaptive 
evolution algorithm for optimally assigning eigenvectors to reduce structural vibration and 
acoustical radiations. The structural vibration and sound pressure radiation can be expressed in 
terms of a combination of vibration modes, where its magnitude is also a function of the external 
disturbance distribution. In other words, the vibration response and radiated sound pressure level 
depend on both the right eigenvectors (related to the structural mode shapes) and left eigenvectors 
(related to the system disturbance rejection ability) of the vibrating structure.  The right 
eigenvector assignment is the concept of mode shape tailoring. The assigned criterion for 
vibration control is to alter the right eigenvectors through active action such that the modal 
components corresponding to the concerned region are as small as possible. For structural noise 
control purpose, the design criterion is to modify the right eigenvectors through active action 
such that the modal radiation from the mode shape of vibrating structure is minimized. The left 
eigenvector assignment is the concept of disturbance rejection. The design concept is to alter the 
left eigenvectors by active action so that they are as closely orthogonal to the forcing vector as 
possible. The basic idea of the proposed approach is to adaptively adjust both the right and left 
eigenvectors, so that the structure’s mode shape and capability of disturbance rejection can be 
modified for vibration control and noise reduction purposes.  The adaptive evolution algorithm 
for choosing the left and right eigenvectors will be developed with geometric interpretation. The 
feedback control will be achieved through active action of piezoelectric actuators. The adaptation 
rule of the evolution algorithm is based on minimizing the orthogonality indices and modal 
energy ratio (vibration control purpose) or modal radiation indices (noise control purpose), such 
that the optimal left and right eigenvector set can be determined.

1. Introduction 
Vibration isolation is a very important issue in the mechanical and aerospace engineering 
fields.  Basically, the goal of isolator design is to reduce the vibration transmission from the 
external disturbances to the certain regions within the frequency range of interest.  Among the 
different vibration isolation methods, passive isolators have been widely used to decouple the 
concerned regions of the structure from the vibrating sources [1-3].  Alternatively, the 
eigenstructure assignment approach has attracted considerable attention for active structural 
control [4-7] and can thus be utilized for vibration isolator design [1, 8].   
The general eigenstructure assignment approach allocates not only the closed-loop

Let S(λj)=[A-λjI | B], and use singular value decomposition technique.  S(λj) can be expressed as 
*( ) -  |   |  0j j j jλ λ⎡ ⎤ ⎡= =⎣ ⎦ ⎣S A I B F D j⎤⎦G ,                        (5) 
where Fj and Gj are the left and right singular vector matrices and satisfy the unitary condition 
[17].  Since A-λjI is nonsingular, Dj will be a positive definite diagonal matrix containing all the 
singular values of S(λj).  One can partition the matrix Gj as the following form,

Clearly, ( )12jg  forms the achievable subspace for the j-th right eigenvector.  In other words, the 
j-th achievable right eigenvector must be a linear combination of the column vectors of ( )12jg , i.e.

The feedback gain matrix is thus determined as 
1( )a −=K W Φ ,                              (9) 
The vibration response of the closed-loop state equation with zero initial conditions can be 
expressed in terms of closed-loop eigenvalues and the corresponding left and right eigenvectors,

As observed in Equation (10), the vibration response of the close-loop system, x(t), caused by the 
external excitation, f(t), depends on both the left eigenvectors (disturbance rejection concept) and 
the right eigenvectors (mode shape concept).  The goal of this research is to develop an adaptive 
evolution algorithm for determining the optimal combination of left-right eigenvectors, and then 
synthesize the feedback gain matrix, so that the close-loop system can achieve improved vibration 
suppression performance at the attenuated end of the isolator compared with the previous methods. 
The proposed adaptive evolution algorithm is to find the optimal combination of left-right 
eigenvectors that can achieve enhanced vibration suppression at the attenuated end of the isolator.  
According to the characteristics of left and right eigenvectors in vibration isolation control 
problem, the design principle of left eigenvectors for vibration isolation control is to alter the left 
eigenvectors through active action, such that they are as closely orthogonal to the disturbance 
distribution vectors as possible [13-15].  The orthogonality index of the j-th left eigenvector [1] 
is thus used to evaluate the system capability of disturbance rejection in the proposed ALREE 
algorithm, i.e.

Concurrently, the design principle of right eigenvectors for vibration isolation control is to 
re-shape the right eigenvectors through active action, so that the modal components 
corresponding to the concerned region are as small as possible [1, 4, 6-8, 16].  Therefore, the 
modal energy ratio index is used in the proposed ALREE algorithm to assess the modal 
confinement ability [7, 8].  The modal energy ratio index of the j-th right eigenvector can be 
described as

This situation implies that the correct evolution direction tends toward the upper bound set.  
Therefore, the j-th right eigenvector of the lower bound at the (k+1)-th step is instead of the 
intermediate right eigenvector, φjM(k+1), and then repeat the evolution process as expressed 
in Equation (14) and (15), i.e.

This situation implies that the evolution direction is close to the optimal one.  Therefore, the 
j-th right eigenvectors of the lower and upper bound sets at the (k+1)-th step are re-assigned 
so that one can shrink the range between the upper and lower bound sets.  The j-th desired 
right eigenvector of the upper bound at the (k+1)-th step is first decided by squeezing 
φjM(k+1) and φjU(k), i.e.

By repeating the above steps, the isolation performance index value varies and then decreases to a 
steady situation (a constant or small fluctuated value).  The steady situation of the isolation 
performance indices can thus be expressed as 
( 1) - ( )  M Mk k εΠ + Π ≤ , for any k > kΠ,                            (23) 
 5
where kΠ and ε are the selected step index and small value for the stoppage criteria of the 
 7
left eigenvectors.  A smaller quantity σj means the left eigenvector ψj is more orthogonal to the 
disturbance distribution vector ek, as expressed in Equation (11), and hence the system has better 
ability of disturbance rejection.  One can observe that all the orthogonality indices of the system 
are reduced by both the SLREA and ALREE methods compared with the original system without 
control and the traditional pole placement method.  Therefore, both the SLREA and ALREE 
methods can achieve the disturbance rejection of the system significantly, as shown in Figure 5.  
Figure 6 shows the modal energy distribution of all system states corresponding to the structural 
displacements and velocities.  The state 1-9 represent the structural displacements and state 10-18 
represent the structural velocities.  The first and tenth states correspond to the displacement and 
velocity of the attenuated end (left boundary of the rod in Figure 1) of the isolator, respectively.  
The ninth and eighteenth states correspond to the displacement and velocity of the excitation end 
(right boundary of the rod in Figure 1) of the isolator, respectively.  In this research, the concerned 
region consists of the left half part of the isolator, which is represented by the displacement states 
1-5 and the velocity states 10-14.  As shown in Figure 6, the modal energy of the system has been 
re-distributed obviously through both the SLREA and ALREE methods.  One can clearly see that 
both the potential modal energy (related to the displacements) and kinetic modal energy (related to 
the velocities) decrease significantly at the states 1-6 and the states 10-15 that represent the modal 
responses on the left side of the isolator.  On the other hand, the modal energy levels increase at 
some of the states (the ninth, and sixteen to eighteenth states) of the unconcerned region, indicating 
that these two methods can confine part of the modal energy in the unconcerned region.  One can 
also observe that the modal energy levels of all the states through the ALREE method are higher 
than those through the SLREA method.  However, as shown in Figure 3, the vibration suppression 
performance at the attenuated end can be further improved by the ALREE algorithm as compared 
with the SLREE method.  On the other hand, Figure 5 shows that the orthogonality indices of the 
system can be further decreased by the ALREE algorithm except for the fourth and sixth modes.  
This implies that the ALREE method achieves better system ability of disturbance rejection than 
the SLREA method does in this test bed example.  Therefore, one can conclude that the left 
eigenvectors dominate the vibration isolation performance in this isolator system.   
4. Conclusions 
A new adaptive left-right eigenvector evolution (ALREE) algorithm is proposed in this 
paper to determine the optimal combination of left-right eigenvectors of the closed-loop system 
for further improving the vibration isolation performance compared with the previous approaches.  
The left and right eigenvectors during the evolution process are derived according to the tendency 
of the isolation performance index that is defined by combining the orthogonality index and 
modal energy ratio index.  The left and right eigenvectors solved by the proposed ALREE 
algorithm represent the optimal combination of the left-right eigenvectors’ contributions that can 
concurrently achieve the disturbance rejection and modal confinement, and thus enhance the 
vibration isolation performance.  The result shows that the isolation performance index can be 
decreased by adjusting the left-right eigenvector combination in the proposed ALREE algorithm, 
and therefore the vibration amplitude at the attenuated end of the isolator can be further 
suppressed by the proposed method.

ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this research is to investigate the feasibility 
of utilizing the adaptive sandwich algorithm to find the optimal 
left and right eigenvectors for active structural noise reduction.  
As depicted in the previous studies, the structural acoustic 
radiation depends on the structural vibration behavior, which is 
strongly related to both the left eigenvectors (concept of 
disturbance rejection capability) and right eigenvectors 
(concept of mode shape distributions) of the system, 
respectively.  In this research, a novel adaptive sandwich 
algorithm is developed for determining the optimal 
combination of left and right eigenvectors of the structural 
system.  The sound suppression performance index (SSPI) is 
defined by combining the orthogonality index of left 
eigenvectors and the modal radiation index of right 
eigenvectors.  Through the proposed adaptive sandwich 
algorithm, both the left and right eigenvectors are adjusted such 
that the SSPI decreases, and therefore one can find the optimal 
combination of left and right eigenvectors of the closed-loop 
system for structural noise reduction purpose.  The optimal 
combination of left-right eigenvectors is then synthesized to 
determine the feedback gain matrix of the closed-loop system.  
The result of the active noise control shows that the proposed 
method can significantly suppress the sound pressure radiated 
from the vibrating structure. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Significant research efforts have been conducted in the 
field of active control of sound.  In the conventional active 
noise control (ANC) approaches, destructive interference is 
generally applied by other acoustic sources to reduce the sound 
pressure field [1-3].  On the other hand, the active structural 
acoustic control (ASAC) concept has also attracted 
considerable attention, where the radiated sound pressure is 
suppressed by directly applying active actions to the radiating 
structure rather than by exciting the medium with the acoustic 
sources [4].  With the ASAC technique, sensors and actuators 
are integrated in the vibrating structure to form a compact, 
smart and quiet system [5]. 
Various ASAC methods have been explored in the past.  
Meirovitch and Thangjitham presented a state-space, model-
based ASAC approach to reduce the resulting far-field radiated 
sound pressure through vibration control [6].  Alternatively, 
the quadratic optimization techniques are utilized in some 
ASAC studies to determine the required control forces and 
moments on the vibrating structure that will minimize the 
radiated acoustic power [7-10].  The radiated structural noise 
can also be formulated as the standard LQR (linear quadratic 
regulator) and LQG (linear quadratic Gaussian) problems, and 
the active feedback system can suppress the structural radiated 
sound pressure that is included within the cost function 
expression [11-13]. 
The concept of structural modal shaping was introduced 
into the ASAC problem in the past decade.  Naghshineh and 
Koopmann [14] presented an improved ASAC method based 
on the minimization of the total power radiated from the 
vibrating structure that is expressed in terms of a truncated 
series sum.  Each term of the sum is related to the coupling 
between the acoustic basis function of the radiation impedance 
matrix and the structural surface velocity vector.  It has also 
been shown that the radiation modes can be calculated as the 
eigenvectors of an elemental radiation resistance matrix [15].  
Constans et al. [16] presented a numerical tool to minimize 
sound power from a vibrating shell structure. The optimal 
design of a weak radiator is achieved by tailoring the mode

where λj is the j-th eigenvalues of the closed-loop system, φj 
and ψj are the corresponding right and left eigenvectors, 
respectively, and ek is the k-th column vector of disturbance 
distribution matrix E.  From Equation (6), it is clear that the 
sound pressure radiation depends on both the right eigenvectors 
(mode shape concept) and left eigenvectors (disturbance 
rejection concept).  The goal of this research is thus to 
determine the optimal combination of left-right eigenvectors of 
the closed-loop system through the adaptive sandwich 
algorithm, so that the state feedback gain matrix K can be 
synthesized to achieve the suppression of acoustical pressure 
radiated from the vibrating structure. 
One can formulate the closed-loop system in terms of the 
desired closed-loop eigenvalues and their corresponding right 
eigenvectors, i.e. 
j j , j=1, 2,…, N,          (7) 
where λj is the j-th eigenvalue of the closed-loop system 
(A+BK), and φj is its corresponding right eigenvector.  One 
can re-write Equation (7) as

p×p sub-matrices, respectively.  Clearly, ( )12
jg  forms the 
achievable subspace for the j-th right eigenvector.  In other 
words, the j-th achievable right eigenvector (superscript “a”) 
must be a linear combination of the column vectors of ( )12

where rj is p×1 scalar vector to be decided.  The feedback 
gain matrix is thus determined as 
1( )a −=K W Φ ,               (13) 
where Φa and W represent the matrices containing N 
achievable right eigenvectors, φja, and wj, respectively. 
For active structural acoustic control (ASAC) purpose, the 
left eigenvectors of the system are related to the system ability 
of disturbance rejection.  Reciprocally, the right eigenvectors 
of the system represent the modal velocity distributions.  
Therefore, the design principle of left eigenvectors, from 
Equation (6), is to alter the left eigenvectors ψj through the 
active action, so that the disturbance distribution vectors ek are 
as orthogonal to the left eigenvectors as possible [18, 20].  On 
the other hand, from Equation (6), the design principle of right 
eigenvectors is to re-shape the right eigenvectors φj through the 
active action, such that the modal velocity profiles cause as 
weak radiation as possible.  The proposed algorithm is to find 
the optimal combination of left-right eigenvectors that can 
achieve minimized sound pressure radiated from the vibrating 
structure.  According to the design principle of left 
eigenvectors, the orthogonality index of the j-th left 
eigenvector defined by Wu and Wang [18] is utilized to 
evaluate the disturbance rejection ability in the proposed 
adaptive sandwich algorithm, i.e.

This situation implies that the correct optimizing direction 
tends toward the upper bound set.  Therefore, the j-th 
right eigenvector of the lower bound set at the (k+1)-th 
step is instead of the intermediate right eigenvector, 
φjM(k+1), and then repeat the process as expressed in

This situation implies that the optimizing direction is close

of the lower and upper bound sets at the (k+1)-th step are 
re-assigned to reduce the range between the upper and 
lower bound sets.  The j-th desired right eigenvector of 
the upper bound set at the (k+1)-th step is first decided by 
squeezing φjM(k+1) and φjU(k), i.e.

By repeating the above steps, the algorithm process terminates 
while the SSPI value is under the steady situation (a constant or 
small fluctuated value), i.e. 
SSPI ( 1) -SSPI ( )  , for any   M M kk k kε+ ≤ K>
ight
,  (28) 
where Kk is the selected step index and ε is a selected small 
value for the stoppage criteria of the algorithm.  Therefore, 
one can solve the state feedback gain matrix K for ASAC 
purpose by finding the intermediate right eigenvectors at the 
step that is corresponding to the minimal SSPI value and 
utilizing Equation (13). 
As stated previously, the proposed adaptive sandwich 
algorithm is developed under the hypothesis that the optimal 
combination of left-right eigenvectors for ASAC purpose will 
be the compromise of the two extreme cases, the result of pure 
left eigenvector assignment method (only disturbance rejection 
concept) and the result of pure right eigenvector assignment 
method (only mode shape tailoring concept).  Therefore, the 
two extreme cases can thus be selected as the initial guess of 
the upper and lower bound sets in the proposed sandwich 
algorithm and can provide the baseline of the control 
performance for the proposed method, i.e.
