1Introduction
Pedestrian movement is an important research issue for the design, evaluation and
management of building and urban spaces. Complex and unpredictable as it may appear to be,
some researchers realized that pedestrian movement can be simulated with various models,
including cellular automata (Yang et al., 2005) (Schreckenberg et al., 2001) (Fang et al.,
2003), fluid dynamic (Helbin et al., 1992), multi-agents (Dijkstra et al., 2002) (Haklay et al.,),
axial maps (Kim et al., 2004), and magnetic forces (Matsushita et al., 1993). The focuses of
research are mostly on the rebuild of pedestrian movement in a virtual world (Haklay et al.,)
and/or the analysis of behavior patterns (Helbing et al., 2005).
The objective of this study is to devise a model that can simulate pedestrian movement in a
building or urban area for some certain period of time, such as a day or a week. The purpose
of the model is to be used in a simulation game or design assisting tool. The model is used as
an internal representation that can be linked to some interfaces for more detailed and realistic
setup for specific characteristics of space and pedestrians.
Pedestrians move according to their preferences and the spatial information they perceive
from their positions. A pedestrian finds the way to its destination in various means. One can
look at signs, ask other people, use mental maps, or simply wonder around to see if any clue
of the right way can be found. Such information may exist everywhere in various forms. We
do not need to reconstruct the physical environment in details to simulate pedestrian
movement, if we are able to define the distribution of information in space. In this research,
we assume a generic and simple pattern over the way spatial information disseminates
through space by means of probability and statistics. Besides way-finding information, some
physical factors of the environment such as temperature and noise may also influence
pedestrian movement. Such factors can also be regarded as spatial information spreading out
from every position to its surroundings. Various forms of information can be integrated into
one platform so that a model based on the dissemination of information can be defined to
setup the environment for the simulation of pedestrian movement.
A pedestrian may move towards a preplanned destination, or wander for various attractions in
a building or urban space. It would be difficult to define a representational model for human
mind and derive sufficient data to initiate a realistic simulation on the behavior. However, if
we look from the macroscopic view at a large number of pedestrians, all kinds of specific
influences to pedestrian behavior can be constricted into some simple values of probability.
This paper describes a model based on simulating the dissemination of information in space,
and stochastic processes that define reactions of pedestrians who sense the information. The
purpose is to reduce the complexity of the simulation as much as possible while retaining
3simulate the pheromone that represents way-finding information based on the assumption that
the probability a pedestrian would find the right way to its destination is proportional to the
distance of its current position and the destination. We do not need to simulate all the spatial
characteristics regarding how the pedestrian finds the way if we are interested in only the
macroscopic view of pedestrian movement. We may use dissemination rules that comply with
the physical law of heat transmission to simulate a map of temperature on the grid. The
attributes of the cell concerns the dissemination of pheromone. For example, in an urban
space the pheromone for way-finding information may spread out to vehicle lanes only at the
road crossing path for pedestrians. The dissemination of way-finding pheromone may be
periodically switched off at road crossing area to simulate traffic lights.
Pedestrian
A pedestrian is viewed as an information processing system that reacts to the information
accessed from ones present location. An agent, representing a pedestrian, is defined as a
stochastic system with finite states. Each state of the agent represents a specific preference of
the pedestrian to some destinations or places with desirable physical condition, such as a cool
and quiet place for taking a rest. Each state of the agent is associated to some rules that
describe a preferred pattern of pheromone. The agent moves to reduce the difference between
the preferred pattern of pheromone and that of the present position. When the current situation
matches perfectly the desirable pattern, the action of the state is completed, and the agent
switches to another state.
Markov chain is used to define the probability of state transition of an agent. A Markov chain
is a discrete-time stochastic process…. A Markov chain describes at successive times the
states of a system. At these times the system may have changed from the state it was in the
moment before to another or stayed in the same state. The changes of state are called
transitions (Wikipedia). Using Markov chain, it is possible to combine various kinds of
pedestrians into one single representation, despite of the fact that each pedestrian may have
different preferences and purpose. It greatly simplifies the simulation for we do not need to
know the preferences of individual pedestrian. Instead we create a generic agent that
represents all pedestrians in the simulation with one single Markov chain. The Markov chain
that describes such a generic agent can be derived by a method called hidden Markov
modeling (Giles et al., 1993). With hidden Markov modeling we can derive the unknown
probabilities of state transition of a Markov chain from observable data. In this research we
assume that for spaces of interest, we may derive one single Markov chain for all pedestrians.
For example, when we make a simulation on a hospital building, we may use only one type of
5We start from a very simple configuration. The space is divided into two areas with a wall in
between them. On each side of the wall, two attractions are placed symmetrically. A number
of agents are divided into two groups. One group moves alternatively between attractions 0
and 1, and the other group moves between attractions 2 and 3. The positions of attractions are
marked with numbers in large font and the positions of agents are marked with small numbers
in all figures showing the result of simulation. The number that represents an agent shows the
target attraction of the agent. After an agent has successfully reached an attraction, it transits
to another state decided stochastically with the Markov chain. In such occasions, we can see
the number that represents the agent changes to show the new target it is heading towards.
Agents in the experiments are initialized with varieties of walking speed. We assume a
normal distribution of speed with 40% of maximum difference in the simulated population.
Figure 1. Simulation with 30 agents for each group with two attractions.
In figure 1 we show a screen catch from a simulation with 60 agents divided into two groups
of the same size. Some interesting result can be found in this simple experiment. First, the
numbers of agents that are heading towards every specific attraction are distributed equally
regardless the initial distribution of the population. When the distribution of population is
changed to some unbalanced proportion, such as all agents heading towards attraction 3 and
zero for attraction 2, it restores to the equilibrium state within 200 steps in the simulation. As
we can see in figure one, the population of each group is restored back to 15 equally. The
number of agents in a group is calculated with the average of 100 steps. Second, we find some
agents do not choose the shortest path, which are the horizontal lines that connect two pairs of
attractions. The agents that walk in the peripheral area are fast moving agents who detour
from the shortest path to over pass agents that move slower, or simply avoiding collision with
agents that head towards the opposite direction. Third, in some occasions, agents with the
same direction line up to avoid frequent collision with agents heading towards the opposite
direction, just like prior research on pedestrian movement has shown in their studies (Helbing
et al., 2001).
7Figure 5 shows that the proportion of population moving towards different attractions drops
from 1 to less than 0.3 as group population increases from 30 to 100. Figure 6 shows the
number of agents who reach the target attraction in 10 steps within groups of various
populations. The figure shows that with 50 agents in the group, the circulation reaches its
maximum efficiency. When the population is smaller than 50, the circulation does not reach
its full capacity, and when the population is greater than 50, circulation jam starts to hold
back pedestrians from reaching the target attraction.

Figure 6. The number of agents reaching attractions in 10 steps within groups of population from 30 to
100.
A hypothesis to explain the uneven distribution is that when the population is too large for the
capacity of circulation, a small discrepancy between the pedestrian densities around the two
attractions would be amplified by positive feedback of the dynamic process. To test the
hypothesis, we started another set of experiments. Figure 7 shows two groups with 30 agents.
One group of agents moves towards attractions 0 and 1 alternatively; and the other group of
agents moves towards attractions 2 and 3 alternatively. The attractions are blocked with walls
to reduce the capacity of the circulation. The distributions of population heading towards

Least square method
The values of dependent variables vary even though all the independent variables are
constant. Therefore, the estimation of the trend the dependent variables is needed. This
process is called regression or curve fitting. The estimated equations (matrix) satisfy the raw
data. However, the equation is not usually unique, and the equation or curve with a minimal
deviation from all data points is desirable. This desirable best-fitting equation can be
obtained by least square method which uses the minimal sum of the deviations squared from a
given set of data. (Fraleigh et al., 1995, p.377)

Conclusion
The result of the pilot study is very positive to the research objective of developing a model
for pedestrian movement. We are confident that the model can be used to implement
simulations that facilitate design process by providing early assessment to circulation problem
and reducing cost.
The model requires several improvements. Firstly, it would require further calibration with
data gathered from field study. Secondly, the simulation result should be compared to the real
world situation. Finally, the simulation is restricted within close system.
We recognize that comprehensive understanding of pedestrian movement is an essential issue
of building management, as well as the design of circulation system. With the current state of
the program, it can be used to do virtual experiments for the analysis of agent behavior that
might have analogy to pedestrian movement in the real world. Such virtual experiments can
be used to do pilot study for designing realistic experiments or observation on human
pedestrians.
