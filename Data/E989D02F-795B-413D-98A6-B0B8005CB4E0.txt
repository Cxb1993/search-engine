I. Abstract 
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a 
collective intelligence problem-solving 
paradigm. By ACO, we can effectively 
distribute the central control unit to achieve 
higher performance. With the scaling of 
Network-on-Chip (NoC) size, more complex 
communication problems can severely harm the 
system performance. Therefore, we need more 
efficient ACO-adaptive routing to achieve 
better trend prediction for global 
load-balancing. In this project, we introduce a 
Multi-Pheromone ACO-based (MPACO) 
routing to make better use of the network 
information and provide a deeper look to the 
local model. By adopting the concept of 
Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in stock 
market, MPACO provide additional dimension 
aspect: rate of change in network information 
by laying pheromone with different evaporation 
speed. The experimental results show that 
MPACO can achieve higher performance. 
However, the cost of the ACO network 
pheromone table is too high, and this overhead 
grows fast with the scaling of NoC. In order to 
fix this problem, it is essential to model the 
ACO algorithm in more careful consideration 
of the system architecture, available hardware 
resource, and appropriate transformation from 
the ant colony metaphor. In this project, we 
also analyze the NoC network characteristic 
and bring about the corresponding issues of 
implementing ACO on NoC. We proposed a 
Regional ACO-based routing (RACO) with 
static and dynamic regional table forming 
technique to reduce the cost of table, share 
pheromone information, and adopt look-ahead 
model for further load-balancing. The 
experimental results show that RACO can be 
implemented with less memory, less cost 
increase on scaling, and better performance of 
load-balancing compared to traditional 
ACO-based routing. 
 
II. 計畫原由與目的 
With the shrinking size of the 
deep-sub-micron (DSM) technology and higher 
density on-chip components, Network-on-Chip 
(NoC) communication architecture have been 
proposed to mitigate the effects, including 
on-chip implementation. The scaling of NoC 
causes the memory cost, table access time, and 
power consumption of table computation to 
grow significantly [7]. This project gives a 
solution to the above problem by discussing the 
NoC system architecture, hardware resource, 
and making an appropriate transform from the 
ant colony metaphor. We propose a Regional 
ACO-based routing (RACO) for load-balancing, 
which take advantage of the regional 
characteristic of NoC system and ant colony 
properties. The contributions are listed as 
follows: 
 Region mapping procedure of the 
ACO-based selection flow for preserving 
the ant colony nature and feasible 
implementation. 
 Static Regional Table Forming 
Technique for routing table entry 
reduction with food-oriented regional 
network information. 
 Dynamic Regional Table Forming 
Technique for routing table entry 
reduction with path-oriented regional 
network information. 
 RACO with Look Ahead Model for more 
precise network information on 
load-balancing.  
 
III. 相關研究現況 
    First we review the adaptive routing.  
Then we introduce the ACO-based adaptive 
routing [13][15] and the relation between the 
traffic balancing and implementation cost.  
A. Adaptive Routing 
    In adaptive routing, the routing function 
provides the path diversity for the selection 
function. A good selection function helps to 
spread the traffic and make network load more 
balanced according to the detailed network 
information. The network information can be 
classified as spatial and temporal information. 
Spatial network information is the buffer state 
of the different directions. Local information 
and regional information are the output buffer 
length of local router and neighbor routers 
respectively. Temporal information consists of 
current and historical information. Selection 
function bases on the present condition or the 
past experience to choose a path. Therefore, 
different selection functions make use of the 
different combinations of network information. 
    Adaptive routings can be classified as 
congestion-oblivious and congestion-aware 
according to whether selection functions 
consider the output link demand or not [20]. 
The congestion-oblivious adaptive routing does 
not take account of the output link status. 
Random selection function randomly chooses 
an output channel from the candidate channels, 
which is simple to implement, but it cannot 
balance traffic load. The congestion-aware 
adaptive routing [20] takes account of the 
output link status. Therefore, these selection 
functions can adjust path selection with the 
time-variant congestion status. Output buffer 
length (OBL) selection function chooses an 
output channel with the shortest occupied 
buffer length [10]. OBL makes a routing 
decision with the current local network 
information. Neighbors-on-Path (NoP) 
selection function chooses an output channel 
that has the shortest occupied buffer length of 
neighbor and local router on routing path [10]. 
That is making a routing decision with the 
current regional network information. Using 
only current spatial network information in 
making routing decisions is efficient for local 
traffic balance, but it cannot guarantee global 
balance [11]. 
and row number is equal to the channel number 
of each router. Besides, every router has the 
table, so it is duplicated by the number of 
routers. Therefore, the cost of routing table is 
too high to implement in NoC systems. 
 
Figure 3.  Area cost of routing table. 
 
IV. 研究方法 
The following of this section can be 
separated into two parts. The first part is to 
describe the detail of Multi-Pheromone 
ACO-based (MPACO) routing, while the 
second part is for Regional ACO-based (RACO) 
routing. 
Part 1. — Multi-Pheromone ACO-based 
Adaptive Routing (MPACO) 
In this section, we first show the idea that 
is inspired by the real world stock market. Then 
formulate the multi-pheromone problem and 
describe the MPACO in detail. Finally, we give 
the MPACO algorithm flow. 
A. Inspiration from Stock Market 
In the domain of finance, the method of 
technical analysis is used for forecasting the 
direction of prices through the study of past 
market data, primarily price and volume. 
Although this analysis in real world may 
deviate during to the complexity of real world 
event, for on-chip communication, the trend of 
traffic flow is more predictable with the regular 
structure of NoC. And we are enthusiastic if 
there is a rule that can help us to predict the 
global information of NoC. In the research of 
ACO pheromone, we found out that ACO is in 
some sense similar to stock market, for stock 
market to also have many investors 
simultaneous making decision with certain 
strategies and cause the price to go up and 
down that much similar to the pheromone 
change with time, through the laying and 
evaporation. 
The general form of moving average is 
called Simple Moving Average (SMA), as in (4) 
N is n-data points and Pt refers to the price on 
data point t. The period N is selected depends 
on the kind of movement we are concentrating 
on, such as short, intermediate, or long term. An 
SMA can lag to an undesirable extent, and can 
be disproportionately influenced by old data 
points dropping out of the average. This is 
addressed by giving extra weight to more recent 
data points, as in the weighted and Exponential 
Moving Averages (EMA). The EMA have the 
form in Eq. (5).

St is the value of EMA and Pt is the 
observation of price at time period t, α is a 
weighting between P and S. Since we have 
mentioned there are short, intermediate and 
long term for N in SMA. For the case in Eq. (5), 
the short/long term EMA have larger/smaller 
value of α, and the interaction between an short 
and long term EMA have two characteristic that 
worth to note: 
‧Long Term EMA (LTEMA) can be interpreted 
as resistance in a rising market, or support in a 
falling market, which means if the Short Term 
EMA (STEMA) is on a certain side of LTEMA, it 
is incline to stay for a while, and have an

 Notice in Eq. (10), we define a quantity 
ΔPHST to represent the trend of PHST, where 
ΔPHST is positive/negative for PHST have the 
trend of rising/falling. However, since PHST 
often jiggle up and down and it is also costly to 
record the many previous PHST values. 
Therefore, we use a trend counter TC(t) with N 
bits (hold the value of 0~2
N
-1) and use PHST(t) 
to stand for PHST on time period t, In Eqs. (11)

C. MPACO Algorithm and Design Flow 
Since the PHST of Advance and Reaction is 
above PHLT, thus in traditional method Advance 
and Reaction are considered to be better then 
Decline and Rally. However, we consider the 
order in Eq. (13). For channels have different 
status, the channel with the highest ordered 
status is chosen. If there is more than one 
channel in the highest ordered status, then we 
choose the channel with the highest PHST, and 
choose a random channel when there are more 
than one highest PHST. The MPACO algorithm 
flow is shown as Fig. 4.

Part 2. — Regional ACO-based (RACO) 
Adaptive Routing 
A. Problem of migrating ACO-based 
routing from computer network to NoC 
The routing problem in computer network 
can be basically divided into two goals: (1) 
search for shortest path in a greed style, and (2) 
maintain the former goal in adapting to the 
topology change of the network. To achieve 
these two goals, traditional routing algorithms 
have to transmit the routing table or flood 
link-state-packet at regular intervals and update 
the entire routing table from time to time [14]. 
ACO-based routing was then proposed in order 
to reduce the overhead of transmission and 
update cost of traditional routing algorithms in 
computer network. Compare with the routing 
table, the size of transmitted ants is relatively 
small in ACO-based routing. To the aspect of 
routing table updating, ACO algorithms need 
only to update an entry in a pheromone table 
independently. Although ACO-base routing has 
given a solution in computer network, when it is 
adopted to solve the routing problem on NoC, it 
is necessary to consider how the ant colony 
metaphor should change to fit into NoC 
architecture and characteristics. The 
comparisons are listed as follows: 
 Available memory :  
For storing the network pheromone, 
the routing table in computer network 
can be storing in cache memory (e.g. 
content-addressable memory), while the 
memory resource in NoC is very limited. 
 Topology : 
The topology of computer network 
changes when clients get connect and 
disconnect to the network, while in 
general the topology of NoC does not 
vary with time. 
 Queuing delay : 
The cost function of routing problem 
of computer network and NoC is shown 
by (14) and (15). In minimizing the 
average latency, the average queuing 
delay of computer network is generally 
negligible compared to average 
We have mentioned the characteristic of 
NoC on network dependency. This phenomenon 
is shown in Fig. 7, when transferring packet 
from source router (Src) to destination router 
(Dst), with negligible queuing delay and the 
time-variant topology. The Dst and other 
routers are actually independent in Fig. 7(a). 
However, in Fig. 7(b), when the Dst router 
happens to be the traffic hotspot, the nearby 
routers also suffer from a severe congestion. 
From the above discussion, we can conclude 
that this NoC characteristic should be added to 
original ACO table.

(b) in NoC. 
C. Information Sharing Problem and 
Analysis 
Referring to Fig. 8(a), which illustrates the 
information sharing problem of original table, 
assume there are two adjacent routers A and B 
that are possible destination of the current 
source router, and share similar traffic 
information. In the origin table, the 
optimization problems of A and B are separated 
in two different entries. Suppose it happens to 
be a local congestion cause by traffic hotspot of 
the north channel in the current router. Since 
the paths that lead to A and B are much the 
same, the ant packet shall have very similar 
network experience reaching these two 
destinations. Suppose that the ant packets have 
already moved to A for many times but have 
not yet ever set B as destination.  Thus, the 
pheromone information in A’s entry is well 
aware of the historical congestion status of the 
north channel, and have the higher probability 
to choose the east router as the next hop to 
reach A. 
 
Figure 8.  (a) The information sharing problem of original table. (b) 
Router A and B are merged into one entry on the routing table. 
However, when the ant packet is now start 
move to B, since the information of different 
entries cannot share with one another, the ant 
the same with TCR. It is worth to mention, with 
the same ratio of the ant packets, the updating 
rate (UR) of a table entry is increased in the 
inverse of TCR in (17).

E. Static Regional Table Forming 
Technique 
The definition of a Static Regional Table 
Forming Technique (SRTFT) is the region 
location does not change with the different 
source router position (i.e., the shift of the nest), 
which can refer to Fig. 10. If the packets on 
different source routers have to travel with the 
Manhattan distance on the NoC axis, it may 
happens that different routers shall choose 
different path (i,e, channels) to reach the same 
region. Since the region (food) stay still on the 
NoC, we can also consider this technique a 
food-oriented style since this system has the 
food to be an unchanged factor. 
 
Figure 10.  Destination region location is unchanged in SRTFT. 
For simplicity, we consider all the regions 
have the same size and shape, with this 
characteristic. For an NxN NoC, we define the 
constant size to be S, (18) is the relationship 
between total routers, entry number NE and size 
S. 
         2 xEN u m b e r o f R o u t e r s N N S        (18) 
For an 8x8 mesh NoC, we set the shape to 
be square and size S to be 4 and 16, the location 
set to be in order on the NoC as shown in Fig. 
11. Since there are 64 routers in the network, 
the table entry number NE can be calculated as 
16, and 4 from (18). 
For the region relation mapping, 
pheromone updating, and pheromone sensing 
in SRTFT, we need to build a relation between 
each router and table entry for table accessing. 
The mapping of the full table of an 8x8 NoC is 
with coordinate of x-axis and y-axis is denoted 
0 to 7 in decimal, while is 000 to 111 in binary. 
We can use different number of bits for the 
table accessing, for example, as shown in Fig. 
12, the SRTFT uses different digit of bits in the 
mapping of routers to regions. 
 
Figure 11.  SRTFT with NE =16 and 4 on 8x8 mesh. 
 
Figure 12.  Mapping relation with different size of region. 
F. Dynamic Regional Table Forming 
Technique 
The Dynamic Regional Table Forming 
Technique (DRTFT) is defined as the location 
of regions changes with the different source 
router position, which can refer to Fig. 13. We 
consider the source router as the origin of the 
coordinate axis and extend the four channels to 
divide the NoC into four regions, which is like 
the four quadrant. No matter where the source 
routers are located on the NoC, for sending 
 Figure 15.  (a) Mapping relation of DRTFT with NE =4. (b) Mapping 
relation of DRTFT with NE =8. 
G. Regional ACO-based Routing with 
Look-Ahead LocalModel 
Consider the state transition function of 
equation (1), the Lj term is inversely 
proportional to the queue length of channel j, 
which is much similar to OBL selection 
function, thus for higher performance on 
load-balancing, we can replace this function 
with more efficient look-ahead selection 
function. 
Look-ahead selection functions adopt a 
local model that can trace forward than current 
router, for example, Neighbor-on-Path (NoP) 
selection function [10], it first check the 
channels of neighbor routers whether permit or 
not by the channel constraint function for the 
current destination. Then score these permitted 
channels under reserve status and occupied 
buffer length. With more detailed information 
of the congestion in the network, NoP 
outperforms other selection function while the 
energy overhead is analyzed to be negligible in 
comparison. Due to the area saving in RACO, 
the adoption of look-ahead local model 
becomes more feasible and can help to improve 
the performance on load-balancing. 
 
V. 效能評比 
The following of this section consists of 
two parts, which respectively show the 
performance evaluation of MPACO and 
RACO. 
Part 1. — Performance Evaluation for 
RACO 
A. System Setup 
The evaluate of the experiment is by the 
NoC simulator Noxim [16]. A 8x8 network 
topology is adopted under wormhole switching 
mechanism [11], round-robin arbitration, and 
the odd-even routing function [6]. While packet 
length is set to 8 filts and queuing buffer on 
each channels of a router have buffer depth of 4 
flits. And the time distribution of traffic is 
Poisson distribution. For the traffic distribution, 
we use the uniform distribution and transpose1 
distribution to evaluate the performance. In 
transpose1 distribution, router (x,y) sends 
packet to router (N-1-y,N-1-x) in NxN mesh. 
The maximum channel load of transpose1 
distribution is much more serious than uniform 
distribution [11]. Therefore, the simulation 
result is shown with transpose1 distribution in 
the experiment, and in uniform distribution, the 
results that conformed the expected 
performance. The simulation cycles is 52,000 
cycles and the first 2,000 cycles is warm-up 
time of NoC system. The average latency under 
different packet injection rate is the 
performance index of the experiments. We also 
adopted the saturation throughput [17], which 
is the throughput when average latency is 
equals to the double of zero-load latency, as the 
evaluation metric. 
 
c. Case3: Regional ACO under NoC Scaling 
For analyze whether RACO can have 
better ability on load-balancing compare to 
other selection functions when the NoC scales. 
In Fig. 20, for NoC mesh size range from 4x4 
to 16x16, we analyze the saturation throughput 
of different selection functions. Since DRTFT 
can use the same region mapping relation 
described in equation (20) and (21), we choose 
RACO-DRTFT with NE = 4 and 8 to compare 
with OBL, NoP, and ACO with full table. The 
results show on different scale of NoC, the 
RACO-DRTFT has higher saturation 
throughput. In another word, RACO-DRTFT 
holds the highest load-balancing and can resist 
to scaling. From the experimental result, the 
total cost reduction (TCR) of RACO-SRTFT is 
98.44% and 96.88% with NE = 4 and 8 
compared to the full table under16x16 mesh 
NoC.

d. Case4 Look-Ahead Regional ACO 
We adopted the look-ahead local model the 
RACO-DRTFT with NE = 8 and evaluate the 
performance compared to other selection under 
transpose1 traffic in Fig. 21. For tidiness, the 
results that already shown in Case1 and Case2 
of random, OBL and NoP selection functions 
is not shown again.  From the figure, the 
RACO with look-ahead model outperforms 
ACO and RACO without model. The 
improvements of the Look-Ahead RACO to 
the random, OBL, NoP, and ACO with full 
table are 42.83%, 32.67%, 15.02%, and 
12.29% in terms of saturation throughput 
respectively, which conforms to previous 
discussion.

Part 2. — Performance Evaluation for 
MPACO 
A. System Setup 
The evaluation of the experiment is by the 
NoC simulator Noxim [16]. An 8x8 network 
topology is adopted under wormhole switching 
mechanism [11], round-robin arbitration, and 
the odd-even routing function [6], also change 
the handshaking mechanism from two cycles to 
one cycle. While packet length is set to 8 filts 
and queuing buffer on each channels of a router 
have buffer depth of 4 flits. And the time 
distribution of traffic is Poisson distribution. 
For the traffic distribution, we use the uniform 
distribution and transpose1 distribution to 
evaluate the performance. In transpose1 
distribution, router (x,y) sends packet to router 
(N-1-y,N-1-x) in NxN mesh. The simulation 
cycles is 52,000 cycles and the first 2,000 
cycles is warm-up time of NoC system. The 
VI. 結論 
Two routing schemes were proposed in 
this project, which are Multi-Pheromone 
ACO-based routing (MPACO) and Regional 
ACO-based routing (RACO). The MPACO 
adopt the concept of stock market moving 
average to achieve better trend prediction on 
NoC. With the proposed MPACO and its flow, 
we effectively forecasting future pheromone 
trend with higher-dimension information of 
pheromone interaction. The experiment result 
also exhibit the load-balancing ability of 4.21% 
to 22.11 % performance improvement compare 
to other adaptive selection functions. RACO, 
on the other hand, provides a better transform 
for the ant metaphor to NoC. Compared to 
traditional ACO-based adaptive routing, RACO 
with SRTFT/DRTFT can increase the 
feasibility for on-chip implementation and have 
better performance, and the routing table cost 
of the 8x8 NoC can be reduced to 93.75% and 
87.5% by proposed method. The RACO can 
also preserve the ability on load-balancing 
under NoC scaling, with higher saturation 
throughput; RACO can reduce the routing table 
cost to 98.44% and 96.88% of 16x16 NoC. 
With combining a more efficient local model, 
the Look-Ahead RACO can further improve 
the saturation throughput from 12.29% to 
42.83% compared to the other four selection 
functions.

Trends in Wireless Applications 的和我們的研究很有相關，讓我
很有興趣。 
在會場上，學生遇到很多研究成果十分卓越的教授和研究生，他們分
別來自不同國家(包含美國、法國、加拿大、西班牙等國家)，與他們
討論研究成果及聊天。在眾多的 Poster session 之中，讓學生最為
印象深刻的是「A 17-tap 3.5 Gbps finite impulse response pulse 
shaping filter for 60 GHz transmitter with QPSK modulation 
」，聽到學者們針對高頻傳輸的演算法設計，運用有效的 shaping 來
filter 加速收斂速度以及進行最佳化設計，亦從不同的角度提出不
同的見解。總而言之，這次會議的參與者是來自世界各地，因此，
學生可經由跟不同參與者的討論，深刻體會各個國家之間不同的研
究精神，以及屬於自己的設計方法。 
 
三、 建議 
這次的會議是在西班牙舉行，消費水準相當高，建議學校及教育
部可以增加補助學生出國參與國際會議的金額，以鼓勵學生多參與國
際學術活動，並減輕學生經濟上的壓力。同時，建議學校方面應開拓
國際化的視野，引進更多國際教材，帶入更多國際人才，如此才能夠
讓學生的素質提昇，擁有更寬廣的視野。

關, 因此在這次參與會議的過程中, 與生醫訊號處理領域相關學者的討論, 給予
本人更多關於生醫領域研究之面向; 此外在呈現面其他團隊的做法亦有可取之
處, 可協助前瞻生醫電子晶片開發與醫療系統整合計畫成果展示的設計方向。 
 
過程 
會議日期為 2010/10/06至 2010/10/08共三天; 本人的著作安排在第二天下午
的 poster session 3, 係專門針對生物與生醫訊號處理作討論, 此 session總共有 7
篇 paper發表。Session中有多位專家學者對本人所帶領團隊之研究方法與成果有
興趣。 
 
心得及建議 
在訊號處理領域, 近年年生醫訊號相關問題與研究數量與討論大幅增長, 為
進一步落實未來行動醫療的可行性, 微電學門在此領域有許多可以發揮的空間。

NaBIC 2010會議今年在日本福岡縣北九州市小倉町的北九州國際會
議中心舉辦，會議總共為三天(12/15-12/17)，大會在前兩天安排了許
多跟主題相關的演講及討論活動(包含仿生演算法、智慧型、分散式
系統等)，且三天都有正規的論文發表會議。每天早上和下午都有不
同主題的平行進行的三到六個討論主題，內容十分精采且緊湊。  
NaBIC的Lecture議程討論風氣極盛，在每15~25分鐘的論文發表演講
之後，大家都會爭相詢問主講人各式各樣在設計上的問題及演算法中
的要點，彼此的攻防提供大家對仿生群集演算法和系統設計的不同想
法。不僅如此，在會場中，也遇到很多研究成果十分卓越的教授和學
生，與他們聊天及討論他們的研究成果，讓我們的收獲十分豐富。  
7.會議心得  
對於為了能源的適當利用和更具智慧的系統，而進行仿生運算及系統
設計研究領域的學者而言，可以利用NaBIC 2010國際會議的機會，針
對大家的研究方向進行經驗交流和心得分享。同時，大家可以透過會
議中的報告與討論，了解不同國家的智慧型電路設計發展，以及不一
樣的研究特色，對學生的未來研究十分有幫助。  
在這次大會中，印象最為深刻的是: Interactive Evolutionary 
Computation and Affective Computing 的Special Session，聽到來自不
同國家和地區的學者針對互動進化型運算的演算法、架構和系統設計
8.建議  
這次的會議是在日本福岡縣北九州市小倉町舉行，但日本的消費水準
較台灣稍高，建議可以增加補助學生出國參與國際會議的金額，以鼓
勵學生多參與國際學術活動，並減輕學生經濟上的壓力。同時，建議
學校方面應開拓國際化的視野，引進更多國際教材，帶入更多國際人
才，如此才能夠讓學生的素質提昇，擁有更寬廣的視野。  
9.攜回資料內容及名稱  
1. 論文相關資料總集一本  
2. USB會議論文一份(內含所有發表的論文)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
二、 與會心得  
對於仿生領域的研究學者而言，可以透過此年度盛會 2010 NaBic
國際會議的機會，針對大家的研究方向進行經驗交流和心得分享。同
時，大家可以透過會議中的報告與討論，了解不同國家在仿生研究上
的研究發展，以及不一樣的研究特色，對學生的未來研究十分有幫
助。 
   在研究方向上，由論文可看出幾個重要的研究趨勢：仿生演算法
中的 ACO及 PSO仍為研究的重點，可以應用於晶片內網路提升網路效
能，降低成本及低功率設計是大家關注的；也從單目標設計延伸成多
目標最佳化的架構設計。另外有晶片實作、軟體模擬等，如何使用目
前之多核心系統，改進系統層級模擬效率是大家關切的技術。 
   在 Lecture 議程中，與本實驗室研究相關的 session 分別如下:
