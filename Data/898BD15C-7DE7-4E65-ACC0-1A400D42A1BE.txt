hydriding/dehydriding processes.  The reaction vessel was made of an AISI 316 stainless 
steel.  The pressure conditions for the absorption and desorption steps were set at 3 MPa and 
vacuum, respectively, at 300 oC.  Particle morphology of the Mg2Ni alloy before activation 
and after a 45-cycle test was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Results 
showed that the accumulation phenomenon in the hoop strain disappeared at the latter 
hydriding/dehydriding cycles due to agglomeration of the Mg2Ni alloy powders no matter at 
the location of 1/10 or 3/10 height of the vessel.  The cycle number at the disappearance of 
the accumulation of hoop strain at the location of 1/10 height of the vessel was smaller than 
that of the 3/10 height by 5 cycles.  This was ascribed to a continuous increase in the height 
of an agglomerated disk formed at the bottom of the reaction vessel.  SEM observations 
showed that a pulverization mechanism caused the particle size of the Mg2Ni powders to 
decrease from 74 to 1 μm after activation and a 45-cycle test.  After supplying sufficient 
hydrogen gas, the hoop strain on vessel wall was increased linearly with progressive cycles 
throughout the testing period.  When the Mg2Ni alloy powders were agglomerated, the hoop 
strain increment was reduced.  It indicates that the volume expansion induced by the Mg2Ni 
hydride powders was reduced by agglomeration.

1. Introduction 
 
 Because fossil fuels are being rapidly consumed and oil price is getting higher, a 
replacement for fossil fuels becomes more and more important.  Hydrogen is one of the 
promising alternatives to fossil fuels.  Hydrogen is a clean type of energy.  The functional 
steps of using hydrogen can be divided into three steps: production, storage, and use.  For 
storage, there are four methods to store hydrogen:  (i) high-pressure hydrogen gas at room 
temperature, (ii) liquid hydrogen, (iii) hydrogen storage alloy, and (iv) other methods.  
Hydrogen storage alloy can store more hydrogen atoms in volume density than other methods 
[1].  Therefore, using metal hydrides to store hydrogen is a better and safer way.  There are 
many kinds of hydrogen storage alloys.  It can be generally classified as five types:  AB5, 
AB2, AB, A2B, and BCC [2, 3].  Mg2Ni is one of the A2B type and used as the hydrogen 
storage alloy in this study.

2.2. Material and testing procedure  
 
 The hydrogen storage alloy used in this study is Mg2Ni which was provided by Hsu et al. 
[9] in the form of ingot.  The alloy ingot was crushed into powders with a particle size under 
a 200-mesh sieve.  The powders were then packed into a vessel with a packing fraction of 50 
vol.%.  The Mg2Ni powders were activated by alternately being evacuated for 1 h at 300 oC 
and then charged with 3 MPa hydrogen gas for 1 h at 300 oC.  After 5 cycles of activation, 
the cyclic hydriding/dehydriding processes started to run in a way that the Mg2Ni powders 
were charged with 3 MPa hydrogen gas for 30 min at 300 oC and then evacuated for 75 min at 
300 oC.  The particle size of the Mg2Ni powders was examined by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) before activation and after a 45-cycle test.  During absorption and 
desorption processes, the variation of the hoop and axial strains at various locations on the 
vessel surface was also measured through the attached strain gages. 
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1 Hydrogen storage capacity 
 
 A constant-volume method was applied to measure the hydrogen absorption dynamics and 
the results are shown in Fig. 3.  In Fig. 3, the hydrogen contents absorbed during the 
absorption process at the 1st, 10th, 20th, 40th, and 45th cycles were made a comparison.  
The maximum hydrogen content absorbed at the 1st cycle is 0.4 wt% while it was increased 
to 0.45 wt% at the 45th cycle.  The maximum hydrogen storage capacity for Mg2Ni is 3.6 
wt%.  Apparently, there is a large gap between 0.45 wt% and 3.6 wt%.  This is due to a 
limited amount of hydrogen gas supplied into the reaction vessel.  The available volume of 
hydrogen gas in the tube and reaction vessel is 32.4 cm3 and the amount of Mg2Ni powder 
stored in the reaction vessel is 12.4 g in this work.  For an ideal absorption process, the 
hydrogen pressure would be reduced from 3 MPa to 0.6 MPa (plateau pressure at 300 oC).  
According to the ideal gas law, the maximum hydrogen content absorbed is 0.46 wt% for the 
current case.  The measured value at the 45th cycle (0.45 wt%) is very close to this ideal 
value.  Therefore, a shortage of hydrogen gas supplied into the reaction vessel might explain 
why the maximum hydrogen content absorbed in the current case is less than the target value 
of 3.6 wt%. 
 6
disk was well stuck to the vessel wall, the stuck wall would move together with the expansion 
of the agglomerated hydride disk in the axial direction during the absorption step.  Note that 
the yellow vertical arrows in Fig. 6 indicate the expansion of the agglomerated hydride disk in 
the axial direction.  In addition, the volume expansion of the loose metal hydrides above the 
agglomerated disk would continuously generated the axial strain by pushing down the 
agglomerated disk, as shown by the red vertical arrows in the Fig. 6.  Therefore, the 
increasing gradient in the variation of the axial strain with cycle number at the location of 
3/10 height was continuous after the 30th cycle, as shown in Fig. 4.  On the other hand, the 
gradient in the variation of the hoop strain with cycle number at the location of 3/10 height 
became zero after the 30th cycle; i.e., the strain accumulation phenomenon no longer existed.  
The size of the gaps between the larger powders at lower positions became smaller and 
smaller when the pulverization process continued.  Eventually, the pulverized Mg2Ni 
powders could not fall into the small gaps.  Then, the hoop strain at the location of 3/10 
height did not increase after the 30th cycle.  As a result, the axial strain is larger than the 
hoop strain at the latter cycles.   
 Figure 4 also shows the variation of hoop strain with cycle number at two locations (H1 
and H2) on the vessel surface.  Similar to the trend of H1 described above, strain 
accumulation was also observed for H2 and the solid symbol is also higher than the 
corresponding hollow one.  Before the 29th cycle, the hoop strains at the lower position (H2) 
were greater than the corresponding ones at the higher position (H1).  This is due to 
pulverization and sedimentation of Mg2Ni powders during this cyclic hydriding/dehydriding 
period.  Similar phenomena were also found for other metal hydrides [5-7].  Such 
pulverization and sedimentation mechanisms are responsible for the strain accumulation, as 
described above.  Therefore, the alloy powders were more densified at a lower position 
during the early cyclic hydriding/dehydriding stage leading to a greater strain value of H2 
over H1 before the 29th cycle. 
 After about the 25th cycle, the gradient in the variation of the hoop strain with cycle 
number at the lower position (H2) became zero and then negative, i.e. the strain accumulation 
phenomenon no longer existed.  The disappearance of strain accumulation was also found at 
the higher position (H1) from the 30th cycle and the reason is described above.  The same 
reason can be applied to explain the situation at H2 for the cycle numbers from 25 to 35.  
However, when the cycle number reached to 35, the gradient in the variation of the hoop 
strain at H2 became negative.  As the size of the gaps between the alloy powders at the 
bottom of the vessel became much smaller at the latter cycles, the Mg2Ni alloy powders at the 
 8
the hoop strain increments (H1 and H2) decreased drastically at the latter cycles.  On the 
other hand, the agglomerated disk was stuck to the vessel wall and pushed down by the 
volume expansion of the loose Mg2Ni alloy powders above it at the absorption step, as shown 
in Fig. 6.  The red vertical arrows in Fig. 6 indicate the axial direction in whish the loose 
hydride powders pushed the agglomerated disk.  Thus, the axial strain increment was 
continuously generated by the loose Mg2Ni alloy powders above the agglomerated disk.  
When the amount of the loose Mg2Ni alloy powders above the agglomerated disk became less 
and less, the axial strain increments gradually decreased with cycle number. 
 
3.4 Variation of particle size 
 
The particle size was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before activation 
and after the 45-cycle test, as shown in Fig. 8.  Before activation, the alloy ingot was crushed 
into powders with a particle size smaller than a 200 mesh.  The size of a 200 mesh sieve is 
about 74 μm.  The distribution of the particle size of the Mg2Ni alloy powders was very 
dispersive when they passed a 200-mesh sieve as shown in Fig. 8(a).  However, all the 
Mg2Ni alloy particles are smaller than 74 μm.  On the other hand, the distribution of the 
particle size of the Mg2Ni alloy powders is less scattering after a 45-cycle test as shown in Fig. 
8(b).  All of the Mg2Ni alloy particles after testing are of a size about 1 μm.  The reduction 
of the Mg2Ni powder size was attributed to the pulverization.  However, some Mg2Ni alloy 
powders of a size about 50 μm were found after the test, as shown in Fig. 8(c).  It indicated 
that hydrogen gas was not absorbed by these powders.  Therefore, hydrogenation and 
pulverization did not occur in these powders.  The low hydrogen capacity can be evidenced 
by this observation.  Because some powders did not react with hydrogen, the measured 
hydrogen capacity is then far away from the ideal value 3.6 wt%. 
 
3.5 Effect of amount of hydrogen gas supplied 
 
Because of an insufficient amount of hydrogen gas supplied into the hydride storage 
vessel in the previous case, a 300-cm3 chamber was added and attached to the manifold to 
perform an additional cyclic hydriding/dehydriding test.  The experimental conditions and 
procedures were the same as those in the previous case except an addition of a 300-cm3 
chamber.  The hydrogen absorption dynamics of Mg2Ni alloy was shown in Fig. 9 after a 
 10
storage capacity between the 1st and 10th cycles as shown in Fig. 9.  Therefore, the reason 
for the decreasing strain increment in the first 10 cycles is that the extent of volume expansion 
induced by the Mg2Ni hydride might be reduced by formation of agglomerated Mg2Ni alloy 
powders after hydriding.  The volume of the Mg2Ni alloy powders would theoretically 
increase after hydriding.  However, the Mg2Ni alloy powders would stick together after 
agglomeration leading to a reduction in the extent of volume expansion.  In this regard, the 
hoop strain increment induced by the volume expansion of the Mg2Ni powders might be 
restricted by the agglomerated Mg2Ni powders.  After the 25th cycle, the hoop strain 
increments at H1 were generally greater than those at H2.  In the latter cycles of this case, 
the Mg2Ni alloy powders might be over-agglomerated at the bottom of the vessel.  It appears 
that the volume of the agglomerated Mg2Ni alloy powders in the second case is quite larger 
than that of the first case, as shown in Fig. 13.  The gaps between the agglomerated powders 
at the bottom of the vessel became smaller and smaller such that hydrogen gas could not be 
easily delivered into these areas.  Due to this reason, less and less hydrogen gas was 
absorbed by the over-agglomerated Mg2Ni alloy powders at the bottom of the vessel.  Finally, 
the hoop strain increments at the lower position H2 became smaller than those at the higher 
position H1 after the 25th cycle. 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
(1) The maximum hydrogen content absorbed in the given Mg2Ni-hydride reaction vessel is 
less than the ideal value of 3.6 wt% due to a shortage of hydrogen gas supplied into the 
vessel.  
(2) With regard to the variation of surface strains with cycle number at a location of 3/10 
height of vessel, the hoop strains were slightly greater than the axial strains except at the 
latter testing cycles.  The strain accumulation phenomenon in the hoop strain 
disappeared at the final one third of the hydriding/dehydriding cycles due to 
agglomeration of the Mg2Ni alloy powders. 
(3) The hoop strains at a lower position (1/10 height) were greater than the corresponding 
ones at a higher position (3/10 height) for the first two thirds of the testing period.  
After about the 25th cycle, the gradient in the variation of hoop strain with cycle number 
at the lower position became zero and then negative.  Apparently, the agglomeration of 
Mg2Ni powders stopped the increase of the hoop strain at an earlier cycle for a lower 
position than that for a higher position.

The objective of this study is, by using finite element analysis (FEA), 
to characterize the effects of clamping load on the thermal stress 
distribution in a prototypical, planar solid oxide fuel cell (pSOFC) 
stack with compliant mica-based seal gaskets.  A three-dimensional 
(3-D) FEA model was constructed for a multiple-cell stack to perform 
comprehensive thermal stress analyses at steady operation and 
shutdown stages.  The constructed 3-D FEA model consists of 
complete components in a practical pSOFC stack, including positive 
electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) assembly, interconnect, 
nickel mesh, glass-ceramic seals, and compressive mica seals.  Five 
different compressive loads (0.06, 0.1, 0.6, 1, and 6 MPa) were applied 
in the modeling to clamp the given integrated pSOFC stack.  
Simulation results indicate that increasing the applied clamping load 
from 0.06 to 0.6 MPa could eliminate bending deformation in the PEN 
plate and its supporting frame.  For a further increase of the applied 
clamping load to 1 and 6 MPa, the critical stresses in the glass-ceramic 
and mica sealants increased to a potential failure level.  In this regard, 
a 0.6-MPa clamping load is considered an optimal assembly load that 
can both eliminate bending deformation in the PEN-frame assembly 
plate and maintain acceptable critical stresses in the glass-ceramic and 
mica sealants. 
 
Introduction 
 
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) utilize solid ceramics as the electrolyte and electrode and 
operate at a high temperature, e.g. 600-800oC for planar SOFCs (pSOFCs).  The 
high-temperature operation of SOFC gives rise to significant thermal stresses due to mismatch 
of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between components and temperature gradients in 
the SOFC stack.  Such thermal stresses can cause delamination and microcracking in the 
critical layers of the cell stack and degrade the SOFC performance.  Reliability is one of the 
most important issues in design of pSOFC and thermal stress is a major factor to affect the 
structural integrity of a cell stack.  Therefore, a comprehensive thermal stress analysis of the 
SOFC stack is necessary for a success in design and operation of an SOFC system.  A 
typical unit cell in a pSOFC stack is composed of a positive electrode-electrolyte-negative 
electrode (PEN) assembly and interconnects (ICs). In practical applications, multiple cells are 
usually integrated by bipolar ICs into a cell stack. Sealants are required at interfaces between 
adjacent cells as a gasket to prevent gas leakage and electrical conduction. For pSOFC, the 
sealing approaches can be classified into rigid seals and compressive seals (1). Rigid seals, 
primarily glasses or glass-ceramics, do not require applying load and have an excellent 
sealing efficacy. A comprehensive three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) 
9 
8-node continuum shell element (SC8R) was selected in the model. There are total 26993 
elements and 47074 nodes in the 3-D model shown in Fig. 2. 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, the bottom plate of the model is under a plane-support condition and 
the symmetric plane is constrained. On the top plate of the SOFC stack, a uniformly 
distributed, compressive load is applied. In general, stresses caused by self-weight of the 
SOFC components are relatively small compared to thermal stresses such that they are 
neglected in this simulation. In this model, a tight-bonding constraint condition was set 
between the glass-ceramic seal and the connecting PEN and frame. The interfaces between 
other connecting pairs of components were set in contact constraint with no consideration of 
frictional force.

As shown in Fig. 1, the materials used in the pSOFC design include Ni/YSZ (PEN, green 
regions), Crofer 22-APU (frame and IC, gray regions), G-18 glass-ceramic (rigid sealant, 
yellow regions), phlogopite mica (compressive sealant, orange regions), and nickel (white 
regions). A PEN assembly consists of anode, electrolyte, and cathode. In order to simplify the 
FEA model, an approximation was made by treating the anode-supported PEN assembly as a 
single material, i.e. Ni/YSZ anode material. As reported in the literature (4), the average 
strength of the PEN is about 187 MPa at room temperature (RT). The fracture stress of an 
oxidized anode was decreased about 40% when it was reduced at 800 oC (5). Hence, the 
strength of PEN could be assumed to be decreased to 112 MPa at 800 oC. The flexural 
strength of G-18 glass-ceramic sealant obtained by four-point bending at RT (6) is 48 MPa. 
The elastic properties of the mica sealant are orthotropic and assumed to be equal to those of 
single-crystal phlogopite mica, as shown in Table I (7).  The value of the Young’s modulus 
at 800oC for the given mica was estimated based on the data at RT (7) and a 
temperature-dependent relationship of elastic modulus for a thin ceramic plate (4).The tensile 
strength of the mica sealant parallel to (001)-plane is about 37 MPa at RT which was 
determined in house.

Results and Discussion 
 
In the current study, five different assembly loads (0.06, 0.1, 0.6, 1, and 6 MPa) were 
applied to investigate the stress distributions in a 3-cell pSOFC stack.  In order to illustrate 
the thermal stress distributions in the given pSOFC stack at various stages of an operation 
cycle, the calculated stress fields for each component in the case with an applied clamping 
load of 0.6 MPa are presented in details as an example.  For the other cases, instead of 
showing the detailed stress fields in each component, only the critical stress values at various 
stages are listed in form of tables to compare with the case of 0.6 MPa.  Only the greatest 
MIPPS and maximum Tresca equivalent stress (MTES), hereafter also called the critical 
stresses, in each component of the entire 3-cell stack model were identified and discussed.

Table II lists the critical stresses in various components at all stages for an applied 
clamping load of 0.6 MPa. The critical stresses in the PENs, glass-ceramic sealants, and 
metallic frames were located at the co-sintered boundaries because of the CTE mismatch 
under a large temperature difference, as shown in Figs 5-7. In Stage 2, all components show 
an asymmetric stress distribution due to the asymmetric thermal field. The corresponding 
stress distributions in the PENs, glass-ceramic sealants, frames, and nickel meshes of the top, 
middle, and bottom cells are almost the same. This means that the thermal stress distribution 
does not vary significantly with cell position. It should be noted that the critical stress of the 
PEN at Stage 2 is higher than the failure stress of a PEN assembly at the corresponding 
temperature. Thus, failure may take place at the edges of the PENs at the steady-operation

clamping load seems to be an optimal assembly load that can both eliminate the bending 
deformation of the PEN and maintain an acceptable critical stress in the glass-ceramic sealant.

Conclusions 
 
For a 3-cell pSOFC stack subjected to a clamping load of 0.6 MPa, the PENs might be 
structurally reliable at RT but failure at the edges was predicted to take place at the operating 
stage. The critical stresses in the glass-ceramic sealants, mica gaskets, and metallic 
ICs/frames were lower than the corresponding fracture strength indicating a reliable structural 
integrity at the operation and shutdown stages for these components. The highly-stressed 
regions of the PEN, glass-ceramic sealant, and supporting frame were located at the 
co-sintered boundaries due to thermal expansion mismatch. A 0.6-MPa clamping load is 
regarded as an optimal assembly load for the given pSOFC stack design as the bending 
deformation in the PEN-frame assembly plate was eliminated and the critical stresses in the 
glass-ceramic and mica sealants were below the failure levels.  Stress distributions in the
