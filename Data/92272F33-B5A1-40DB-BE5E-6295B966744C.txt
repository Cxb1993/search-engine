ABSTRACT 
This paper presents the identification of structural systems 
under tri-directional seismic excitations using a statistically 
refined Bouc-Wen model of tri-axial interaction.  Through 
limited vibration measurements in the National Center for 
Research on Earthquake Engineering in Taiwan, the Bouc-Wen 
model has been statistically and repetitively refined using the 
95% confidence interval of the estimated structural parameters 
so as to determine their statistical significance in a multiple 
regression setting.  The effectiveness of the refined model has 
been shown considering the effects of the sampling error, of the 
coupled restoring forces in tri-directions, and of the under- 
over-parameterization of structural systems.  Sifted and 
estimated parameters such as the stiffness, and its 
corresponding natural frequency, resulting from the 
methodology developed in this paper are carefully observed for 
system vibration control.   
INTRODUCTION 
System identification for structural health monitoring [1] 
and damage detection in civil structures is moving to the 
forefront of worldwide research activities.  Such monitoring 
and detection for buildings and bridges is important for the 
public safety related to natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
and is also becoming increasingly important because of the 
aging of infrastructure systems.  Aging infrastructure systems 
are causing extreme concern in densely populated areas and 
there is an urgent need for reliable identification systems that 
are capable of providing an accurate estimation of the safety 
and of the remaining life of such structures.  
This health monitoring has two main applications [2].  
One is related to natural disasters such as earthquakes and 
hurricanes which can damage or destroy civil engineering 
structures such as buildings and bridges.  After such events 
government engineers must make assessments of the 
damage/safety of structures.  Visual inspection only allows 
rather limited information about the extent of damage, since 
damage can easily be present in places that are not visible or 
accessible.  Trying to infer the actual safety of a structure 
from what is visible is risky and inaccurate.  System 
identification methods [3, 4] get around this limitation by 
assessing damage based on dynamic behavior properties, using 
dynamic modeling.  The second main application is to the 
aging infrastructure in the US.  Many of the roadways and 
bridges have become old enough that hidden deterioration can 
be quite serious.  One prime example is the Williamsburg 
Bridge of the New York City, which required very expensive 
renovation.  Hence, this area of research involves both the 
saving of millions of dollars in replacement of buildings and 
bridges and, more importantly, an increase in public safety. 
MODEL-BASED EXPERIMENTATION AND BOUC-WEN 
MODEL OF TRI-AXIAL INTERACTION 
One major area of system identification is to promote 
experimental analyses, where analytical methodologies are 
tested using recorded data in the field or lab.  Important 
challenges are yet to be confronted: stochastic modeling of 
nonlinear systems, uncertainty of measurement, and safety and 
damage assessment [5].  Thus, a statistical confidence interval 
based model refinement approach is developed and applied to 
the un-damped structural system (Fig. 1)—a three-story full 
 3 Copyright © 2007 by ASME 
component y denotes the variation of the restoring force over 
time while the component jx  corresponds to the component 
of the parameter in Eq. (2).  The R-square value [8] refers to 
the fraction (39.55%) of the variation in the values of y that is 
explained by the least-squares regression of y on jx  (j=1, 2, 
3, …, 8). 
Maintaining the components of the estimated parameters 
whose 95% confidence interval does not contain the zero value 
and rerunning the regression will result in Table 2.  As a 
consequence, this statistical sifting process maintains the 
contributing parameters to the structural restoring force for the 
first round.  Continue such a sifting process for the current 
refined model leads to Table 3, which cannot be further 
improved.  In this way, the truly contributing parameters are 
granted more statistical significance.  This can be shown by 
their shorter range of the 95% confidence interval (e.g. the 
parameter of x1 in Tables 1-2), reflecting on the precision of 
parameter estimation.  In addition, the final refined model in 
Table 3 contains only two components: drastically simplified 
model, while the corresponding R-square value drops in 1% 
range, sufficing for a good model refinement approach [8].  
Through the statistically refined Bouc-Wen model of tri-
axial interaction, Table 4 lists the final estimated structural 
stiffness and sifted components for the first floor of the 
structure both in x and y directions and for both all excitation 
record and partial excitation record.  It is noteworthy that the 
goodness of the final refined model is not dependent on the 
different excitation section as reflected on the R-square value.  
However, the R-square value can be a weighting factor when 
calculating the overall weighted average of the structural 
stiffness listed on the last row of Table 4.  The related 
components are taken from the component set of regression 
with the closest value of stiffness to that of the overall 
estimated stiffness.  The second and third floors of the 
structural stiffness can be identified in the same way as listed in 
Table 5.   
In this study, the newly developed model refinement 
approach demonstrates its ability to capture structural signature 
and its applicability to a wide variety of series models, enabling 
an economic design for structural vibration control.  In fact, 
the method of the 95% confidence interval based model 
refinement approach is likely to fail in capturing structural 
properties with the probability of 5% (1-95%) in one set of 
samples [8].  With three set of excitations, it will fail only in 
the probability of 0.0125% (5%*5%*5%), because each test is 
independent with the failure probability of 5%. 
Having obtained the structural stiffness for each floor of 
the structure in both x and y shear-directions, it is possible to 
evaluate the corresponding natural frequencies via [9]: 
 
0det 2 =− nωMK  (4)
 
where det represents the determinant, K represents the stiffness 
matrix, M the diagonal mass matrix, and nω  the natural 
frequency.  Using Eq. (4), the evaluated natural frequencies 
for the first, second, and third modes are listed in the row of 
“Model Refinement” in Table 6 and 7 for the x and y shear-
directions, respectively.   
EVALUATION OF NATURAL FREQUENCY USING 
FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM 
Just for comparison purpose, evaluation of system’s 
natural frequency was conducted using the fast Fourier 
transform (FFT) of each floor’s acceleration signal.  Figs. 3-5 
show the FFT of measured structural accelerations for the first, 
second, and third floor, respectively, in the x direction.  Three 
peak values in amplitude refer to the locations of the system’s 
natural frequencies for the first, second, and third modes.  
Similarly, the natural frequencies can be obtained in the y 
direction.  Tables 6-7 compare the results of evaluated natural 
frequencies using the FFT with those using the newly 
developed model refinement approach in the x and y directions, 
respectively.  Obviously, the model refinement approach 
demonstrates satisfactory results in the evaluation of system’s 
frequency: very close to the results of FFT when other 
simulated models failed such as the model established by 
structural analysis tool SAP2000.  The average relative error 
for the first mode in x and y directions shows only about 3%.  
CONCLUSIONS 
A 95% confidence interval based model refinement 
approach has been applied to the shear-type structural system 
under tri-directional seismic excitations.  Such an approach 
has refined and simplified the extended Bouc-Wen model of tri-
axial interaction.  Inevitable excessive parameters in the 
considered initial model have been repetitively removed in 
each round of multiple regression for successful identifications 
until all the sifted parameters sustain their statistical 
significance, accounting for possible model uncertainties, 
sampling errors, and other source of measurement errors.  The 
effectiveness of such an approach has been shown in the 
evaluation of system’s natural frequency: the average relative 
error of the first mode in both x and y shear-directions is only 
about 3%, when compared to the results using the fast Fourier 
transform.  In addition, the newly developed model 
refinement approach is unlikely to fail in the test cases of El 
Centro, Kobe, and TCU084 excitations, but only with the 
probability of 0.0125%.  The developed identification 
methodology from initial model to model refinement to natural 
frequency evaluation provides reliable indices that are 
indicative of current conditions of structures for safety 
assessment.

ABSTRACT 
This paper proposes an enhanced noise filtering technique 
to the Hilbert-Huang transformation technology for the damage 
detection of structural systems using vibration measurements.  
The Hilbert-Huang transformation technology is a set of 
superior algorithms for analyzing non-linear and non-stationary 
signals and also for linear and stationary signals.  However, 
the signals are filtered by reconstruction from “selected” 
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), derived from the original 
signal through the empirical mode decomposition method.  
The proposed filtering technique offers the criterion for 
selecting the IMFs using the orthogonalization coefficient.  
Through the enhanced filtering, it is possible to increase the 
accuracy for the estimation of the time-varying system’s natural 
frequency, indicative of the degree of damage, which helps an 
effective design of a control system.  
INTRODUCTION 
An opportunity to change perception and be a part of the 
non-stationary system’s renaissance has appeared in the recent 
years because of the invention of the empirical mode 
decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) 
[1, 2]. 
The response of structural systems subjected to arbitrary 
external excitation strongly depends on the nature and value of 
the measured acceleration data, especially in earthquake 
engineering.  The acceleration data that contain the damage 
events can be used to detect the structural damage [3, 4].  
Distinction of the structural mode and the measurement error in 
the recorded data can be made based on the EMD and the 
Hilbert transform, leading to the detection of system’s natural 
frequency as time progresses.  The HHT methodology is 
unlike the conventional analysis of the restoring force, which is 
usually modeled by partial differential equations in space and 
time, followed by transforming them into a set of ordinary 
differential equations [5].  
In general, the HHT dwarfs the traditional fast Fourier 
transform (FFT), which provides less resolution and often 
produces spillover phenomenon in the frequency spectrum [1].  
Traditionally, frequency domain based approaches maintain 
their validity only if the structure remains linear.  However, 
approaches such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) [6] or the 
wavelet transform [7] can still be used in nonlinear analysis by 
performing a moving window analysis of an equivalent time-
invariant linear system.  This approach is suitable for linear 
and weakly nonlinear structures, but might be unsuccessful for 
complex nonlinear identification problems [8].  Hence, this 
study proposes an enhanced noise filtering technique to the 
HHT technology for the damage detection of structural systems 
via vibration measurements. 
EVALUATION OF NATURAL FREQUENCY THROUGH 
ENHANCED NOISE FILTERING 
The HHT technology is a set of superior algorithms for 
analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals and it also 
provides increased accuracy for analyzing linear and stationary 
signals.  The Hilbert transform for an arbitrary time series of 
X(t) can be represented as Y(t):

In order to identify the natural frequency of all modes, the 
above modal analysis can be used for each IMF, from the 
highest to the lowest value of its orthogonalization coefficient 
in an orderly fashion.  However, one constraint—the IMF1 
intrinsically has the highest system’s frequency and the 
frequency decreases in the order of the IMF2, IMF3, IMF4, 
etc.—is imposed on such a procedure.  The required number 
of IMFs used to reconstruct the original signal depends on the 
degree of freedom (DOF) of the structural system investigated.  
Theoretically, the three-story building possesses three modes 
for each floor (DOF).  Yet each IMF may be containing not 
only one modal frequency. 
To ensure that the selected IMF2 in the model-based 
experiment has one natural frequency corresponding to the first 
mode, the FFT of the IMF2 for each floor is performed as 
shown in Fig. 8.  Clearly, one peak value around 4Hz refers to 
the natural frequency of the first mode.   
   Because the system contains three modal frequencies, it is 
necessary to select the next IMF.  The IMF1 for each floor is 
chosen due to its second highest orhtogonalization coefficient 
value.  It is noteworthy that no other IMF can be selected 
since the IMF1 corresponds to the highest frequency range.  
Thus, the IMF1 includes the remaining second and third modal 
frequencies.  Fig. 9 shows the FFT of the IMF1 for each floor, 
confirming the reasoning.  Although the IMF1 for the third 
floor includes three modal frequencies, the amplitude of the 
lowest frequency portion is smaller than that in Fig. 8, and thus 
which part is negligible. 
   Because the selected IMF1 contains two modes, the 
corresponding natural frequencies cannot be effectively 
identified in the marginal Hilbert spectrum as for case of the 
IMF2 in identifying the first modal frequency.  In fact, the 
marginal Hilbert spectrum of the IMF1 is mixed in a way 
toward the part of the frequency with higher amplitude in the 
FFT plot, as shown in Fig. 10.   
   In order to utilize the HHT based marginal Hilbert spectrum 
for higher resolution, the band-pass filter is introduced to the 
IMF with more than one mode for modal frequency analysis.  
Table 3 lists the frequency range of the IMF1 acceleration 
signal through the band-pass filter, which is operated in the 
Fourier spectrum using the cutoff frequency that corresponds to 
the amplitude of 70% of the peak value [11].   
   Through the band-pass filter, the second and third modes 
are effectively separated from the IMF1 as shown in the Hilbert 
spectrum in Fig. 11 for the first floor of the structure for 
instance. 
   The corresponding marginal Hilbert spectrum for the 
second and third modes after the band-pass filter is shown in 
Fig. 12 for the first floor of the structure. 
   Table 4 summarizes the identified natural frequencies using 
the marginal Hilbert spectrum.  Along with the test case of the 
structure under the 1999 Chi-Chi (TCU084, Taiwan) 
excitations, the averaged results are listed in Table 5. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In engineering practice, there are many situations in which 
a feedback identification system is given model uncertainties, 
uncertainty of measurement, for instance, the noise 
contamination from measurement errors.  To effectively 
separate the noise from the signal that contains the conditions 
as well as damage of the structure, the Hilbert-Huang transform 
(HHT) based identification technology is used for time-varying 
structural systems for damage detection purposes.  Time-
dependent structural conditions such as the natural frequencies 
of structural modes are evaluated through the empirical mode 
decomposition (EMD), with the guidance of the 
orthogonalization coefficient, to the band-pass filter, to the 
Hilbert spectrum followed by the marginal Hilbert spectrum.  
The proposed methodology in this study contains 3 advantages: 
1) the original measured acceleration signal must first perform 
the EMD to avoid severe noise contamination when the FFT is 
not able to identify the structural mode by differentiation the 
noise from signal; 2) the orthogonalization coefficient provides 
the capability in selecting the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) 
in an orderly fashion; 3) the advantage of the proposed filtering 
approach not only offers a guide in finding the structural 
nonlinearities, its accuracy and efficiency are not dependent on 
the nonlinear model forms being included in candidate libraries 
that “best” describe the nonlinear structural system of interest, 
as the IMFs are empirical.  Compared to the traditional fast 
Fourier transform (FFT), the developed approach shows 
satisfactory results.  The estimated natural frequencies 
demonstrate more accurate and focused results than those by 
the FFT, showing the common spillover effect.
