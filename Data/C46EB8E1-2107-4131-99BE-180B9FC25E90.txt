  雖然多頻帶正交分頻多工(Multi-Band OFDM)為目前超寬頻技術應用的主流，至今還有另
一個比較廣為學界所研究的技術，稱為脈衝無線電超寬頻技術(IR-UWB) 。在 IR-UWB 系
統，發送訊號的時間極短，並且在時間上以一組假隨機的跳時碼(time hopping code)打散訊
號的週期。因此可以達到 UWB 系統對於低發射功率的要求。然而，這樣的傳輸方法也帶
來一些系統設計上的挑戰，例如通道估測、多路徑訊號的收集、及時間同步。此論文針對
脈衝無線電超寬頻技術(IR-UWB)提出一套架構簡單、效能優良的接收機系統，稱為「延遲
線合併訊號接收器」(delay line combination receiver; DLC receiver)。 
  此論文首先介紹完整的 DLC 接收器的架構，此接收器共包含三大部分，分別是前端的幅
差分延遲線(frame-differential delay line; FDL) ，同步與估測裝置，及解調變裝置。FDL 的
設計是此系統的一項簡單有效的創新，在理論上可以解決接收端因為跳時所衍生出來的時
序控制問題。其作用之一是把接收到的一個週期，例如符號週期，內的訊號集合到同一時
間點輸出。另一個作用是得到任意前後兩個幅之間的訊號乘積，其效果就如同發送參考(TR)
接受器的前端。在同步與估測裝置中，利用上述 FDL 的輸出訊號，經過積分器後，將會在
每一個週期開始的時間點產生一個驟然上升或下降的輸出。利用偵測此一訊號驟升或驟降
的時間點，就可以得到預定的週期開始時間，例如預定為某一段跳時碼的開始時間或是符
號時間。 
因為擷取訊號能量的多寡，取決於積分器積分的時間長短。假如接收的多路徑訊號可以精

1. INTRODUCTION 
This chapter introduces UWB communication systems, and includes a definition of 
UWB systems and a description of their history.  
 
1.1 Background 
   Notably, UWB radios can utilize frequencies in the range of 3.1–10.6 GHz at a 
limited transmission power emission of −41 dBm/MHz [1]. The FCC definition of 
UWB system is that any radio system that has a 10-dB bandwidth exceeding 20% of 
its center frequency or is ≧500 MHz. Due to their high capacity, high data rate, and 
robustness against fading, UWB systems have recently garnered that attention of both 
industry and academia. 
The 802.15.3a Task Group of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE) consolidated 23 UWB physical layer specifications into two proposals. The 
two proposals are MB-OFDM UWB, which is supported by the WiMedia Alliance, 
and Direct Sequence (DS) UWB, which is supported by the UWB Forum. The 
contention between these two groups is the focus of attention in the UWB world. 
Eventually the process in IEEE 802.15.3a progressed into a deadlock between the two 
groups. In Jan. 2006, the IEEE 802.15.3a Task Group members voted to withdraw the 
Dec. 2002 Project Authorization Request (PAR) that initiated the development of high 
data rate UWB standards. As there is no compromise exists, the issue has been left to 
the market to decide [2]. Currently, the MB-OFDM UWB is the most popular UWB 
technology. These applications have speeds up to 480 Mbit/s over 2 meters, or 53.3 
Mbit/s over tens of meters. The MB-OFDM UWB can solve the bandwidth, cost, and 
power consumption requirements of next-generation consumer electronic (CE) 
devices, such as DVD players, HDTVs, MP3 players and stereos.

designed preamble. Moreover, Tian and Giannakis also proposed another 
non-data-aided (NDA) scheme that capitalizes on the cyclostationarity naturally 
present in UWB transmissions in [17]. He and Tepedelenlioglu [18] presented a 
two-stage synchronization algorithm that employed a symbol differential receiver to 
achieve symbol-level synchronization very quickly during the first stage, and then 
searches the frame-level boundary around the obtained symbol boundary during the 
second stage. The two-stage synchronization algorithm takes advantage of the first 
stage to reduce the size of the uncertainty region; however, overall detection 
probability is dominated by the accuracy of the first stage. Yang and Giannakis [19] 
presented a symbol differential synchronization scheme named timing with dirty 
templates (TDT). The synchronization criterion of TDT exploits the fact that the 
cross-correlation of these “dirty templates” exhibits a unique maximum at the correct 
symbol time. Although TDT algorithms are effective, they are inoperable in 
multi-user environments without assigning a specific training pattern for each user.  
 
1.2 Motivation 
Although many studies and development results have been published to resolve 
synchronization issues in TH-IR UWB systems, further investigation and 
development are necessary when developing a high data rate, low power consumption 
and low cost UWB system. Transmitted-reference receivers [9]–[11] have one major 
advantage over coherent receivers in that they capture energy from all multipath 
components at a low implementation complexity. To collect signal energy effectively 
and reduce power consumption at the receiver end, a delay-hopped 
transmitted-reference (DHTR) receiver [20]–[22] mechanism is very effective for IR 
UWB systems. Unfortunately, the reference pulse is corrupted by noise and 
interference. Other evolved TR schemes transmit data by applying differential binary

Chapters 3.1–3.3. In Chapter 3.4, the BER performance of DLC receivers is 
analyzed, and a series of simulations are compared in Chapter 3.5. In Chapter 4.1, 
a novel synchronization algorithm for DLC receivers, the TDLC algorithm, is 
proposed. In Chapter 4.2, the performance of the TDLC algorithm in terms of 
probability of detection (PD) and mean square error (MSE) is analyzed, and a 
series of simulations are compared in Chapter 4.3. In Chapter 5, a novel adaptive 
algorithm is proposed for estimating an optimal integration interval for DLC 
receivers. Finally, conclusions are presented in Chapter 6.

2.1 Channel Models 
To evaluate the performances of physical layers, the IEEE 802.15.3a task group 
has established standard channel models [27], [28]. The features of these channel 
models are described and discussed in this subsection. 
The primary indoor channel models are the Rayleigh tap delay line, the 
Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) [29] model, and the KΔ −  model. Of these models, the S-V 
model with a lognormal fading distribution best fits the characteristics of the UWB 
channel model [30]. Based on the clustering phenomena observed in channel 
measurements, the IEEE 802.15.3a task group finally developed four UWB channel 
models derived from the S-V model with a few modifications. 
Figure 2.2 shows the typical power-delay profile (PDP) of S-V model. To

z Γ : power decay factor for clusters 
z γ : power decay factor for rays within a cluster 
z 1σ : standard deviation of the cluster lognormal fading term (dB) 
z 2σ : standard deviation of the ray lognormal fading term (dB) 
z xσ : standard deviation of the lognormal shadowing term for total multipath 
realizations (dB) 
Since matching all possible channel characteristics is difficult, the main channel 
characteristics used to derive the above model parameters were chosen as follows:  
z mτ : Mean excess delay (ns) 
z rmsτ : RMS delay (ns) 
z NP10dB: number of multipath within 10 dB of the peak multipath 
z NP(85%): number of multipath that capture 85% of channel energy 
z Power decay profile 
The IEEE 802.15.3a task group suggested using some initial parameters for 
different channel characteristics designed to fit measurement results. Table 2.1 lists 
these parameters. Based on these parameters, the examples of plots (Figs. 2.3 and 2.4), 
for which 100 impulse responses are generated for different environments, including 
CM1 and CM4. CM1 is based on the line-of-sight (LOS) environment, and CM4 fits a 
25ns RMS delay spread to represent an extremely non-LOS (NLOS) environment. 
The strongest power of CM1 is near zero nanoseconds (Fig. 2.5); however, the 
strongest power of CM4 (Fig. 2.6) is located at 10–50 nanoseconds. These two figures 
can be used to determine that the delay spread of CM4 is much larger than that of 
CM1.

are introduced. 
 
2.2.1 Timing with Dirty Template (TDT) 
In this subsection, a novel synchronization criterion, (TDT) [19] is introduced 
briefly. This synchronization criterion exploits the fact that the cross-correlation of 
these “dirty templates” exhibits a unique maximum at the correct symbol time.  
The idea behind TDT is to rely on pairs of successive symbol-long segments of 
receive signals, r(t) , taken at candidate time-shifts )0, sTτ ∈ ⎡⎣ , and use one segment 
in each pair as a template for the other. Specifically, integrate-and-dump operations 
are performed on products of such segments to acquire symbol rate samples

for )0, st T∈⎡⎣  are “dirty templates” because they are noisy, distorted by an unknown 
channel, and subject to an unknown effect 0τ  (first arrival time). To elucidate TDT, 
let ( )kχ τ  and ( )tρ  denote the noise-free parts of ( )kx τ  and ( )r t , respectively.

where c is a constant integer; however, the Eq. (2.6) is true for each )0, st T∈⎡⎣  if and 
only if 0τ τ= . That is, the cross-correlation of successive symbol-long received 
segments reach a unique maximum magnitude if and only if these segments are scaled 
versions of each other, i.e., when 0τ τ=  [19], [36]. These studies presented the

symbols. When K increased, the performance of PD in Propositions 1–4 increased. 
However, search time also increased as K increased. 
Although TDT algorithms are blind in the sense that they do not need TH code, 
they are inoperable in multi-user environments in which other users utilize the same 
training pattern. In subsequent subsection, an effective synchronization algorithm for 
multiuser and density multipath environments, the parallel signal acquisition with 
shared looped delay-line (PS-SLD) algorithm [15] is introduced.

2.3 Modulation Schemes 
Some well studied modulation schemes in UWB are BPSK, PAM, and PPM. Of 
these options, BPSK is the most popular modulation scheme in UWB applications due 
to its smooth power spectrum and low BER. However, accurate phase detection of a 
modulated signal in BPSK requires accurate channel estimation at the receiver.  
2.3.1 PPM 
The PPM is a modulation scheme that varies the time-shift between pulses. All 
transmitted pulses have the same amplitudes. When data bit 0 is transmitted, no 
additional time-shift is modulated on the transmitted pulse. Conversely, when data bit 
1 is transmitted, the transmitted pulse is delayed for a time interval equal to δ (Fig. 
2.9). This time delay is generally a fraction of a nanosecond.  
 
Fig. 2.9 A representation of PPM 
 
2.3.2 BPSK 
The BPSK is a binary phase modulation that varies the phase of the transmitted 
pulses (Fig. 2.10). Pulse polarity is positive when data bit 1 is transmitted. Otherwise, 
pulse polarity is negative when data bit 0 is transmitted. This modulation scheme does 
not change the amplitudes of transmitted pulses.

presented. These two synchronization schemes are compared to the proposed 
synchronization scheme in Chapter 4. In last section, some modulation schemes 
are introduced briefly. Notably, the proposed DLC transceiver in this dissertation 
is a modified TR-based scheme that employs modified BPSK modulation.

As Eq. (3.12) can be approximated as a conditional Gaussian random variable by 
 33
bandwidth specified as 1 1pB T= = GHz. The SNR shown as the horizontal axis of 
following plots denotes the SNR of received signals, and it is given by 
( )Rec b f oSNR E N N= . For BER simulations, the transmitted data are generated 
randomly with equal probability between , 1k id =  and , 1k id = − .  
Figure 3.6 shows the simulation outputs of ( , )wTγ ε  with a fixed 0ε =  on CM1 
and CM4. The (0, )wTγ  exceeds 0.9 when 17wT = ns on CM1 or 60wT = ns on CM4. 
According to Eq. (3.32), eP  should be low while ( , )wTγ ε  is large. However, when 
received signals are adversely affected by noise or interference, increasing wT  may 
increase the noise encountered. Setting wT  requires a trade off and the optimal wT  
value varies for different channel environments or SNRs. How to estimate the optimal 
wT  adaptively to optimize the BER is discussed in Chapter 5. In this section, the BER 
is obtained by using a given wT .

3.6 Summary 
 The DLC receiver is effective due to its simple architecture and good BER 
performance. In this chapter, theoretical analyses and simulations are performed. 
Notably, the BER performance may suffer severely from multi-user interference (MAI) 
when TH codes for other users are generated randomly. However, the MAI can be 
canceled by assigning specific TH codes to other users.

4.2 Performance Analysis 
The preceding section described how to determine the estimated symbol 
boundaries ( )symbolt i , as shown in Eq. (4.9). This section analyzes the PD and MSE. 
In Eq. (4.9), the aim of estimator ( )symbolt i  is to find the true symbol boundaries, 
( )symbolt i . Let step size be TΔ , and [ ] ( )sA n iT n Tα Δ= + × . Estimator max ( )t i  is then 
defined as siT n TΔ+ × .  
4.2.1 Probability of Detection (PD) 
The DA mode is considered first, and Eq. (4.6) is rewritten as

PD can then be derived by averaging all possible τε  over the interval [ TΔ− ,TΔ ), and

4.4 Summary 
   In this chapter, a novel timing synchronization algorithm, the TDLC algorithm, 
was proposed for DLC receivers. The TDLC algorithm can achieve timing 
synchronization within a symbol duration. The theoretical analysis for PD and MSE 
were performed for the TDLC algorithm. Simulation results for MSE demonstrate that 
the TDLC algorithm is superior to the TDT algorithm in MSE while 1TΔ = ns, 
especially for a multi-user environment.

estimator max ( 1)t i +  described in Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) would be ambiguous when wT  
is larger than , kk Lτ .

As described, u and M are configurable system parameters. Parameter M should be 
large enough to provide an effective statistic variance of l( )( )wT nχ . The initial value 
of l (0)wT  is fT  and v(-1)=0  is given. Moreover, e(n) is expressed as a sign value 
of v(n)-v(n-1). Finally, l ( 1)wT n +  is account by l ( ) ( )wT n e nμ− × .  
In Fig 5.5, i wT  is 17 ns. When l ( )wT n  is >17 ns, e(n) equals 1. Then l ( 1)wT n +  is 
obtained by l ( )wT n μ− . Conversely, when l ( )wT n  is <17 ns, l ( 1)wT n +  is obtained 
by l ( )wT n μ+ .

Figures 5.10 and 5.11 compare the normalized MSE of the TDLC algorithm and the 
BER of the DLC receiver on CM4. The best wT  is around 45–50 ns while SNR is 
≧21 dB (Fig. 5.4). Figures 5.10 and 5.11 show that the normalized MSE and BER 
converge to l ( )wT n =46 ns when the SNR is increasing.

5.4 Summary 
In this chapter, the proposed LV adaptive algorithm was employed to solve the 
problem of selecting an optimal integration interval for DLC receivers. Section 5.1, 
described why the best wT  setting ( i wT ) can induce the minimum variance of 
estimated timing offsets, ( )i wTτ . Utilizing this result, the LV adaptive algorithm can 
trace the least variance on different wT  settings, and converge to a steady state when 
l i( )w wT n T≅ . The proposed LV adaptive algorithm permits DLC receivers to select a 
best wT  setting adaptively. Simulation results indicate that the LV adaptive algorithm 
can acquire the best wT  setting for DLC receivers and achieve reliable performance 
in terms of both MSE and BER.

Abstract—Delay Line Combination (DLC) receivers have been
proposed for time hopping impulse radio ultra wideband (TH-IR
UWB) systems by Wen and Hsu. In that study, we also presented
a non-data aided synchronization algorithm designated as ”tim-
ing with delay line combination” (TDLC) algorithm. Although
channel estimation is unnecessary for the DLC receivers, the
system performance is affected by the setting of the integration
window length (Tw). By tracking the variance of estimated timing
offsets of the TDLC algorithm for each Tw setting, it’s found that
the minimum variance is obtained at a best Tw setting. However,
the best Tw setting is various in different channel environments.
To optimize the system performance, for example mean square
error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) of the DLC receivers,
we propose a non-data aided adaptive algorithm named ”least
variance” (LV) adaptive algorithm to estimate the best Tw setting
for all channel environments.
Index Terms—impulse radio (IR), ultra-wideband (UWB),
delay line combination (DLC) receivers.
I. INTRODUCTION
BECAUSE the pulse duration is very short, TH-UWBsystems achieve a ﬁne multipath resolution capability,
which makes TH-UWB systems viable candidates for com-
munications in dense multipath environments such as short-
range or indoor wireless communications [1]-[3]. However,
due to the low transmission power of UWB signals, achieving
timing acquisition in UWB systems is difﬁcult. Moreover, the
ﬁne time resolution results in a large number of resolvable
multi-path components, but it also increases the search time
of the acquisition scheme.
In a dense multi-path environment, UWB pulses are dis-
torted by the environment, but they often can be recognized
due to the ﬁne time resolution capabilities [4]. Obviously, a
rake receiver can be used to reduce the impact of interference
by capturing more desired signals [5]. But, the rake receiver
requires the prior knowledge of the delay and attenuation
proﬁle. It is not very practicable during synchronization phase
in the absence of reliable channel and timing information.
Moreover, it also needs a lot of ﬁngers to capture most of
signal energy, resulting in a great complexity in receiver.
A simple receiver structure to capture all of the energy
available in the multi-path channel was proposed by Hoctor
and Tomlinson. This radio communication technique is called
”delay-hopped transmitted- reference” (DHTR) radio commu-
nications [6]. In DHTR systems, pulses are transmitted in
pairs, where the ﬁrst pulse is denoted as the reference pulse
and the second pulse is the data pulse. The reference pulse
acts as a template signal to detect the data pulse. A signiﬁcant
feature of this transmitted-reference (TR) receiver is that it
correlates the data signal with the reference signal without
requiring additional channel estimation and rake reception. But
the drawback of TR systems is a waste of communication
resources, i.e., signal power and channel time, to transmit
reference signals.
The frame-differential receivers presented by Witrisal [7]
utilize the received pulse waveform in previous frame as a
reference template waveform. Since the transmitter does not
send extra reference signals, it can reduce the transmitted
power and inter-frame interference (IFI). The DLC receiver
presented by Wen and Hsu [8] is derived from the frame-
differential IR-UWB system. However, the delay elements in
the DLC receiver are arranged in a cascade rather than in
parallel. This design not only simpliﬁes the DLC receiver, but
also improves its effectiveness in timing synchronization.
Although channel estimation is unnecessary for the DLC
receivers, the setting of the integration window length (Tw)
affects the system performance. In this work, the relation
between the Tw setting and the variance of estimated timing
offsets of the TDLC algorithm is investigated. Furthermore,
we ﬁnd that the minimum variance of estimated timing offsets
is obtained at a best Tw setting. Consequently, an adaptive
algorithm, named the ”least variance” (LV) adaptive algorithm
is presented to estimate the best Tw setting to optimize the
system performance of the DLC receiver for any channel
environment. Simulation results indicate that the LV adaptive
algorithm acquired the best Tw setting for DLC receivers and
achieved reliable performance in both the MSE and the BER.

t
(i+1)
symbol = (i + 1)Ts + τ0,1 , can be determined by detecting
the time at which |α(t)| exhibits its local maximum during
each symbol period.
Figure 2 illustrates the synchronization scenario of the
TDLC algorithm. The time at which |α(t)| exhibits its
maximum is denoted by tˆ(i+1)max and is estimated in accordance
with the criterion
t̂(i+1)max = arg max
ti<t≤ti+1
(|α(t)|), (11)
where ti = i× (Nf +1)Tf , then the estimated arrival time of
the ﬁrst signal in the (i+1)th symbol t̂(i+1)signal can be derived by
t̂
(i+1)
signal = t̂
(i+1)
max − Tw. (12)
Finally, the estimated symbol boundary t̂(i+1)symbol can be
obtained from
t̂
(i+1)
symbol = t̂
(i+1)
signal − c0,0Tc. (13)
Signiﬁcantly, the Tw was assumed to take a known value in
[8]. However, the Tw inﬂuences the system performance, and
its best setting depends on the channel environment.
III. LEAST VARIANCE (LV) ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM
The receiver illustrated in Fig. 1 resembles the original DLC
receiver presented in [8], but here the Tw is assumed to be a
random variable rather than a determined setting. Figures 3
and 4 show the simulations of MSE for different Tw settings
under UWB channel model 1 (CM1) and UWB channel model
4 (CM4) respectively, as proposed in IEEE 802.15.3a [9]. The
best Tw setting is various with different channel environments.
In this case, this work presents an adaptive algorithm to
estimate the best Tw setting for the DLC receiver.
In this study, the estimated symbol boundary t̂(i)symbol is
recast as t̂(i)symbol(Tw), which is various with Tw. Moreover
the estimation timing offset of the TDLC algorithm, τ̂i(Tw),
is deﬁned as
τ̂i(Tw) = |t̂(i)symbol(Tw)− iTs|, i = 0, 1, 2, ... (14)
Consider Γ(Tw)={τ̂i−M+1(Tw),...,τ̂i(Tw)} as observation
samples of τ̂i(Tw), where M denotes the observation window
length. The variance of the Γ(Tw) is denoted as V ar[Γ(Tw)].
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, V ar[Γ(Tw)] changes due to
the different Tw setting, and the output is a second-degree
curve. In this case, the minimum V ar[Γ(Tw)] according
to the Tw setting can be computed by ”stochastic gradient
algorithms”[10].
The proposed LV adaptive algorithm is presented as
follows:
• Parameters:
μ : step size
M : number of observation samples
• Initialization:
T̂w(0) = Tf
v(−1) = 0
• Input:
Γ(T̂w(n)) := {τˆi−M+1(T̂w(n)), ..., τˆi(T̂w(n))}
v(n) = V ar[Γ(T̂w(n))], is the variance of estimated
timing offsets at the nth interaction
• To be computed:
T̂w(n + 1): estimate of the integration window (Tw)
at the (n+1)th interaction
Computation: For n=0,1,2,...
e(n) = sign{v(n)− v(n− 1)}, where e(n) ∈ {−1, 0,+1}
T̂w(n + 1) = T̂w(n)− μ× e(n)
IV. SIMULATIONS
A series of simulations are performed to evaluate the
performance of the proposed TDLC algorithm. The multipath
channels are generated using the UWB CM1, with parame-
ters (1/Λ, 1/λ,Γ, γ) = (42.9, 0.4, 7.1, 4.3) ns. The channel
impulse response is assumed to be invariant over one symbol
duration. For each user k, assuming the propagation delay of
the ﬁrst arrival signal τk,1 is uniformly distributed over [0, Ts)
ns, with Ts = Nf × Tf . The frame duration is speciﬁed as
Tf = 35 ns, and each symbol contains Nf = 32 frames.
For the desired user (indexed as 0), a TH code {c0,j}Nf−1j=0
which satisﬁes D0,p = D0,q for each p = q is selected.
The remaining users are assigned random TH codes uniformly
distributed over [0, Nc) with Nc = 35 and Tc = 1 ns. The
transmitted data sequence, d0,i , is randomly generated.
Figure 5 shows the learning curve of the LV adaptive
algorithm with different μ. The results conﬁrm that the rate of
convergence is dependent on the step-size parameter μ. When
μ is larger, the rate of convergence is faster. However, the
results also show that the steady-state value of the variance
increases with increasing μ. Figure 6 shows the learning curve
of the LV adaptive algorithm with different M. Accordingly,
we may state that the variance deviation (or steady-state error)
decays with an increasing number of M.
Figure 7 shows the normalized MSE for different Tw
settings under UWB CM1. As the results, the best Tw setting
should be 17ns when the SNR is larger than 20dB. Figures 8
and 9 compare the normalized MSE of the TDLC algorithm
and the BER of the DLC receiver respectively between ﬁxed
Tw settings and with the LV adaptive algorithm. Here the
parameters for the LV adaptive algorithm are μ = 1 and
M=10000. Since the best Tw setting under CM1 is 17 ns, we
compare the performance of LV adaptive algorithm with ﬁxed
Tw = 17 in BER and MSE. Simulation results indicate that
the LV adaptive algorithm converged to the best Tw setting,
hence it can achieve reliable performance in both the MSE
and the BER.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This work develops an adaptive algorithm, named ”least
variance” (LV) adaptive algorithm for DLC receivers to solve
the problem of the Tw setting. Because the best Tw setting
induces the minimum variance of the estimated timing offsets,
we propose the LV adaptive algorithm to trace the best setting.
The proposed LV adaptive algorithm permits the DLC receiver
to select the best Tw setting adaptively for various channel
environments. Moreover, we may state that the LV adaptive

As demonstrated in Fig.1, yk,q(t) denotes the output from
the Nf branches of the SLD, where q ∈ [0, Nf − 1] is the
index of a branch, k denotes index of the desired user. The
term yk,q(t) has the form

where τ ∈ [0, Tf ) denotes the candidate time offsets. Let
τ = n × T∆, where the integer n ∈ [0, Nf − 1] is the step
index, and T∆ is the interval among candidate time offsets.
Furthermore, zk,q[n] denotes the integration output of
yk,q(t) based on every step indexes (n). zk,q[n] is given by
zk,q[n] =

where Tw indicates the integration window. Generally, Tw ≤

, the desired terms can be extracted with indexes k1=k2=k,

V. SIMULATIONS
The performance of the proposed PS-SLD algorithm was
evaluated through a series of simulations. The multipath
channels were generated using the UWB channel model pro-
posed by IEEE 802.15.3a [9] with parameters of (1/Λ, 1/λ,
Γ , γ )=(42.9, 0.4, 7.1, 4.3) nanosecond (ns). The channel
impulse response was assumed to be invariant over one symbol
duration. Furthermore, for each user k, an assumption was
made that the propagation delay of the first arrival signal, τk
, was uniformly distributed over the interval [0,Ts) ns, where
Ts = Nf × Tf . The frame duration was specified as Tf=35
ns, and each symbol comprised Nf=32 frames. The desired
user (indexed as k) was assigned a TH code {ck,j}Nf−1j=0 that
satisfied Dk,p = Dk,q for every p = q. The remaining users
were assigned random TH codes uniformly distributed over the
interval [0, Nc × Tc) with Nc=35 and Tc=1 ns. The training
sequence for the data-aided (DA) TDT was composed of a
repeated pattern (1, 1, -1, -1) for all users, but the transmitted
datum, dk,i, is randomly generated in the PS-SLD algorithm.
The integration window, Tw, was specified as 35ns in all
of the PS-SLD simulations. Finally, in all simulations, when
comparing PS-SLD with TDT algorithms, T∆ was defined to
equal Ti in [7].
Figure 2 illustrates the probability of detection (PD) for PS-
SLD algorithm obtained using computer simulation and Monte
Carlo simulation. Simulation results of the PS-SLD algorithm
are nearly the same as the Monte Carlo simulation results
of Eq. (17), indicating that Eq. (17) forms sound theoretical
values of PD. Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results
also demonstrate that Eq. (18) and Eq. (19) are identical.
Figure 3 shows the comparison of PD of the PS-SLD
algorithm and the TDT algorithms. Simulation results indi-
cate that the PS-SLD algorithm obtains a higher PD than
its TDT counterparts. This result is reasonable, since the
SLD receiver utilizes the unique time interval between two
successive pulses, i.e. Dk,p, as the time delay when correlating
the received signal with the time-delayed signal. Hence, the
SLD receiver is more robust to noise and interference than the
dirty templates receiver.
Although the TDT algorithms are blind, the PD of TDT
algorithm is only around 1/Nu , because the receiver can not
determine the desired user’s signals from other users’ signals
in a multi-user environment. In this case, the performance of
PS-SLD is obviously better than that of TDT algorithms in a
multi-user environment.
Figures 4 and 5 compare the MSE between PS-SLD and
TDT algorithms for different T∆, indicating that TDT algo-
rithms with T∆=Tf perform nearly the same as that with
T∆=Tc, but the performance of MSE for the PS-SLD with
T∆=Tc performs superior to that with T∆=Tf . Notably, the PD
of TDT algorithms is lower than that of the PS-SLD algorithm
in Fig. 3, but the normalized MSE of TDT algorithms is not
higher than that of the PS-SLD algorithm in Fig. 4, because
the variance of the estimated symbol boundaries for PS-SLD
algorithm is larger than that for TDT algorithms while T∆=Tf .
Although the performance in MSE of PS-SLD is a little
larger than that of TDT algorithms while T∆=Tf , the PS-SLD
algorithm performs superior to that of TDT algorithms when
T∆=Tc.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This investigation proposes an effective non-data aided
(NDA) timing synchronization scheme named ”parallel signal
acquisition with shared looped delay-line” (PS-SLD). Al-
though PS-SLD has a higher hardware complexity than TDT
schemes, its uncertain region is bounded within one frame
duration, and is only 1/Nf of that of the TDT algorithms.
Simulation results indicate that the PS-SLD algorithm obtains
a higher PD and a lower normalized MSE than the TDT
algorithms in both multipath and multi-user environments.

Abstract—High PAPR of the transmitted signal is a major 
drawback in the OFDM systems. In this paper, coding schemes 
are proposed to reduce high PAPR. One is using parity check 
coding scheme, and the other is using selected mapping (SLM) 
applied scheme. With parity check coding scheme, the parity 
information is used to expand the signal space. Mapping from 
original source information to the corresponding message 
sequence with a low PAPR, the PAPR of transmitted signal can 
be reduced. In the SLM applied scheme, a coding scheme with 
data position permutation and phase rotation is used. For the 
practical application to IEEE 802.11g, the performance of PAPR 
reduction is given. The simulation results show PAPR definitely 
can be greatly reduced with applying the SLM applied coding 
scheme in the OFDM system. 
Keywords- OFDM system, PAPR reduction, Coding scheme, 
Parity check coding scheme, SLM applied scheme, QoS. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Currently, the proposed Fourth Generation (4G) 
communication systems will replace Third Generation (3G) 
systems to support a higher data transmission to meet a quality 
of services (QoS) request [1, 2]. Orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM) technology could be a potential 
candidate to 4G systems [2, 3]. However, using this technique, 
there are some technical difficulties such as synchronization, 
PAPR, interference cancellation, channel estimation [3-6]. 
Among these drawbacks, the major disadvantage of OFDM is 
that the transmitted signal waveform is with a very high PAPR 
[4, 6]. 
A large PAPR increases a complexity of the analog-to-
digital and digital-to-analog converter and reduces the 
efficiency of the radio-frequency (RF) power amplifier [3, 6]. 
To reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signals, many schemes have 
been proposed, such as signal distortion methods, peak 
cancellation technique and scrambling methods [3, 6-10]. 
Among these schemes, the simplest method is using the 
clipping process to reduce the peak amplitudes [3, 7]. 
However, using clipping process causes both in-band distortion 
and out-of-band distortion. Based on the scrambling each 
OFDM symbol, such as selected mapping method, partial 
transmitted sequence (PTS) method and subblock phase 
weighting (SPW) method, the techniques gives the smallest 
PAPR [6, 8-10]. In these methods, the side information needs 
to be transmitted via a control channel. The additional 
bandwidth is needed in the systems. Currently, coding scheme 
has been proposed to reduce the PAPR [4, 11, 12]. For 
example, Golay complementary sequence, trellis coding 
scheme and turbo coding scheme are applied to reduce the 
PAPR in the OFDM systems. The concept of these methods is 
to select those codewords that minimize or reduce the PAPR 
for transmission. However, these approaches need to find the 
codewords with a lower PAPR and to store the information in a 
lookup table for the operation of encoding and decoding. For a 
large number of subcarriers, it needs a large operation 
processing time. It suffers the system performance. 
To reduce the complex symbol choosing procedure, two 
coding schemes applied to PAPR reduce are proposed in this 
paper. One is using parity check coding scheme, and the other 
is using SLM applied scheme. These coding schemes are used 
to generate an extended signal space for symbol choosing and 
benefits to PAPR reduction. In the following section, the 
OFDM system description, PAPR definition and statistical 
property to PAPR are described in Section II. In Section III, the 
proposed PAPR reduction scheme with adding parity 
information and the SLM applied method are presented. The 
numerical results are shown in Section IV. Finally, a 
conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. THE OFDM SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND STATISTICAL 
PROPERTY TO PAPR 
An OFDM system could be considered as the one of 
frequency division multiplex (FDM) technique with the 
functions of parallel transmission, signal mapping and inverse 
fast Fourier transform (IFFT) / fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
[3]. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of a baseband, discrete-
time FFT-based OFDM systems.

mapped with corresponding de-mapping scheme. Then, with 
discarding the parity bit, the estimated source information is 
obtained.

The function of signal space expansion could be realized as 
the transferring the original information symbols with N-1 
elements into the corresponding modulated symbol patterns 
with N elements, as shown in Figure 3. There are 2N-1 possible 
patterns in the signal space if the message sequence is with N-1 
bits. However, there are 2N patterns in the extended signal 
space for the data blocks, after adding the parity information. 
There are 2N-1 desired signal patterns need to be assigned in the 
2N extended signal space. In Figure 3, those 2N-1 signal patterns 
with the least small 2N-1 PAPRs in the expanded signal space 
are chosen as the corresponding symbol. In the figure, the 
circles represent the symbol patterns with the least small 2N-1
PAPRs among 2N patterns and the other symbol patterns are 
represented by the dash circles. Hence, with the mapping, the 
transmitted signal with a low PAPR can be achieved. In the 
implement, the function of signal space expansion could be 
realized with adding a parity bit in Eq. (9).  
Figure 3. The concept of signal assignment to realize the signal space 
expansion 
Besides, with the coding scheme, the frame error rate in the 
system could be improved. In the conventional OFDM system

Abstract—High PAPR of the transmitted signal is a major 
drawback in the OFDM systems. In this paper, coding schemes 
are proposed to reduce high PAPR. One is using parity check 
coding scheme, and the other is using selected mapping (SLM) 
applied scheme. With parity check coding scheme, the parity 
information is used to expand the signal space. Mapping from 
original source information to the corresponding message 
sequence with a low PAPR, the PAPR of transmitted signal can 
be reduced. In the SLM applied scheme, a coding scheme with 
data position permutation and phase rotation is used. For the 
practical application to IEEE 802.11g, the performance of PAPR 
reduction is given. The simulation results show PAPR definitely 
can be greatly reduced with applying the SLM applied coding 
scheme in the OFDM system. 
Keywords- OFDM system, PAPR reduction, Coding scheme,

I. INTRODUCTION 
Currently, the proposed Fourth Generation (4G) 
communication systems will replace Third Generation (3G) 
systems to support a higher data transmission to meet a quality 
of services (QoS) request [1, 2]. Orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM) technology could be a potential 
candidate to 4G systems [2, 3]. However, using this technique, 
there are some technical difficulties such as synchronization, 
PAPR, interference cancellation, channel estimation [3-6]. 
Among these drawbacks, the major disadvantage of OFDM is 
that the transmitted signal waveform is with a very high PAPR 
[4, 6]. 
A large PAPR increases a complexity of the analog-to-
digital and digital-to-analog converter and reduces the 
efficiency of the radio-frequency (RF) power amplifier [3, 6]. 
To reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signals, many schemes have 
been proposed, such as signal distortion methods, peak 
cancellation technique and scrambling methods [3, 6-10]. 
Among these schemes, the simplest method is using the 
clipping process to reduce the peak amplitudes [3, 7]. 
However, using clipping process causes both in-band distortion 
and out-of-band distortion. Based on the scrambling each 
OFDM symbol, such as selected mapping method, partial 
transmitted sequence (PTS) method and subblock phase 
weighting (SPW) method, the techniques gives the smallest 
PAPR [6, 8-10]. In these methods, the side information needs 
to be transmitted via a control channel. The additional 
bandwidth is needed in the systems. Currently, coding scheme 
has been proposed to reduce the PAPR [4, 11, 12]. For 
example, Golay complementary sequence, trellis coding 
scheme and turbo coding scheme are applied to reduce the 
PAPR in the OFDM systems. The concept of these methods is 
to select those codewords that minimize or reduce the PAPR 
for transmission. However, these approaches need to find the 
codewords with a lower PAPR and to store the information in a 
lookup table for the operation of encoding and decoding. For a 
large number of subcarriers, it needs a large operation 
processing time. It suffers the system performance. 
To reduce the complex symbol choosing procedure, two 
coding schemes applied to PAPR reduce are proposed in this 
paper. One is using parity check coding scheme, and the other 
is using SLM applied scheme. These coding schemes are used 
to generate an extended signal space for symbol choosing and 
benefits to PAPR reduction. In the following section, the 
OFDM system description, PAPR definition and statistical 
property to PAPR are described in Section II. In Section III, the 
proposed PAPR reduction scheme with adding parity 
information and the SLM applied method are presented. The 
numerical results are shown in Section IV. Finally, a 
conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. THE OFDM SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND STATISTICAL 
PROPERTY TO PAPR 
An OFDM system could be considered as the one of 
frequency division multiplex (FDM) technique with the 
functions of parallel transmission, signal mapping and inverse 
fast Fourier transform (IFFT) / fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
[3]. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of a baseband, discrete-
time FFT-based OFDM systems.

modulated symbols. The estimated modulated symbols are 
mapped with corresponding de-mapping scheme. Then, with 
discarding the parity bit, the estimated source information is 
obtained.

The function of signal space expansion could be realized as 
the transferring the original information symbols with N-1 
elements into the corresponding modulated symbol patterns 
with N elements, as shown in Figure 3. There are 2N-1 possible 
patterns in the signal space if the message sequence is with N-1 
bits. However, there are 2N patterns in the extended signal 
space for the data blocks, after adding the parity information. 
There are 2N-1 desired signal patterns need to be assigned in the 
2N extended signal space. In Figure 3, those 2N-1 signal patterns 
with the least small 2N-1 PAPRs in the expanded signal space 
are chosen as the corresponding symbol. In the figure, the 
circles represent the symbol patterns with the least small 2N-1
PAPRs among 2N patterns and the other symbol patterns are 
represented by the dash circles. Hence, with the mapping, the 
transmitted signal with a low PAPR can be achieved. In the 
implement, the function of signal space expansion could be 
realized with adding a parity bit in Eq. (9).

expansion 
Besides, with the coding scheme, the frame error rate in the 
system could be improved. In the conventional OFDM system

obtained as [15]
