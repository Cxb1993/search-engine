Abstract 
Although lead and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), both important environmental pollutants, activate cells 
through different receptors and participate in distinct upstream signaling pathways, lead increases the 
amount of LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. We examined the cells responsible for the excess 
production of lead-increased LPS-induced TNF-α and liver injury, and the roles of PKC and p42/44 
MAPK in the induction of TNF-α. Peritoneal injection of lead alone (100 μmol/kg) or a low dose of 
LPS (5 mg/kg) did not affect serum TNF-α or liver functions in A/J mice. In contrast, co-exposure to 
these non-effective doses of lead (Pb) plus LPS (Pb+LPS) strongly induced TNF-α expression and 
resulted in profound liver injury. Direct inhibition of TNF-α or functional inactivation of 
monocytes/macrophages significantly decreased the level of Pb+LPS-induced serum TNF-α and 
concurrently ameliorated liver injury. Pb+LPS co-exposure stimulated the phosphorylation of p42/44 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the expression of TNF-α in CD14+ cells of cultured 
mouse-whole-blood, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, blocking protein kinase C 
or MAPK effectively reduced Pb+LPS-induced TNF-α expression and liver injury. In summary, 
monocytes/macrophages were the cells primarily responsible for producing, through the PKC/MAPK 
pathway, the excess lead-increased/LPS-induced TNF-α that caused liver injury.

Introduction 
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α regulates a variety of biological functions, including organ 
development, immune homeostasis, and malignance. The body subtly regulates the expression 
kinetics and dose of TNF-α  to ensure its proper effect because TNF-α has opposite biological 
effects in different circumstances (Aggarwal 2003; Pfeffer 2003). On the one hand, TNF-α is 
essential for the host in tissue repair and in protective immune responses against infection. On the 
other hand, inadequate TNF-α may have detrimental consequences in sepsis, tumor formation, as 
well as in autoimmune diseases. Regulating the expression of TNF-α has been an important subject 
in managing acute inflammatory diseases that include bacterial sepsis (Spooner et al. 1992). Recent 
studies on chronic neuronal disease revealed a new feature of inflammation: a transient spike of 
TNF-α  expression (i.e., a large amount that peaks after 1.5 h and disappears after 3 h) may induce 
neuronal degeneration resembling the delayed and progressive nature of the symptoms in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease (Gao et al. 2002). These findings indicate that the extent of TNF-α 
expression during a disease determines not only severity and survival rate, but also delayed disease 
sequelae. 
The in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of liver damage of mice, used to determine 
TNF-α-mediated organ failure, is both sensitive and convenient. LPS, a component of the outer 
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, plays a major role in inducing septic shock and is a potent 
inducer of TNF-α in vivo and in vitro (Goldfeld et al. 1990; Ulich et al. 1991). The binding of LPS 
to CD14/LPS binding protein and Toll-like receptor-4 triggers multiple signal cascades that activate 
nuclear factor-κB and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44 MAPK) and lead to the 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α (Triantafilou and Triantafilou 2002). 
LPS causes liver injury at high doses (Kosai et al. 1999), but a modest, non-injurious inflammation 
at low doses (Ganey and Roth 2001) in several animal models. High-dose LPS-induced liver injury 
is partly attributed to excess TNF-α production (Hewett et al. 1993). TNF-α-associated signal

Materials and Methods 
Chemicals 
LPS (derived from Escherichia coli, serotype 055:B5), TNF-α inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX), 
and macrophage cytotoxic agent GdCl3-6H2O were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). 
Lead acetate was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). PKC inhibitor chelerythrine 
chloride (Ch) was obtained from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany) and p42/44 MAPK kinase 
inhibitor U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). 
Cells and animals 
Peritoneal macrophages were isolated by flushing the peritoneal cavity of A/J mice with 10 mL 
of sterile ice-cold phosphate buffer. Peritoneal lavage fluid was centrifuged at 200 g, and pelleted 
cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 U/mL). Cells were then seeded at 2 × 105/well 
in a 96-well plate, incubated at 37°C for 4 h, and washed with PBS to remove unattached cells. 
Attached cells, taken as macrophages and confirmed with F4/80 stain, were used for sequential 
experiments. RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line, were purchased from the American 
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum. A/J mice weighing 20-25 g were obtained from and housed in the laboratory animal 
center of our institution. Animals were housed individually in a room with a 12-h light/dark cycle 
and central air-conditioning (25°C, 70% humidity), fed with standard food ad libitum. The animal 
experiment procedures were reviewed and implemented through the IACUC process of National 
Cheng Kung University. 
Blood collection and biochemistry study 
The blood of mice was collected from the inferior vena cava under ethyl ether anesthesia, 
drawn using venipuncture into serum separation tubes, allowed to clot for 10 min at room 
temperature, and then centrifuged (1000 g, 10 min, 4°C). Serum samples were stored at −70°C. To

Western blot analysis 
RAW264.7 cells were cultured in 0.01% FBS/DMEM for 30 min and sequentially stimulated 
with lead (10 μM), LPS (1 ng/mL), lead (10 μM) plus LPS [Pb+LPS] (1 ng/mL), or saline (control). 
After stimulation, cells were washed with cold PBS and then solubilized with ice-cold buffer 
containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton 
X-100, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 μg/mL 
PMSF, and 2 μg/mL leupeptin. Approximately 10-30 μg of protein was separated using 
electrophoresis in a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the 
protein was electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (NEN Life Science 
Products, Inc., Boston, MA). Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for phospho-p42/44 
MAPK or p42/44 MAPK (New England Biolabs). After being probed with a horseradish 
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, protein signals were visualized using enhanced 
chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) combined with Kodak X-ML film 
exposure. 
Histology 
Liver tissue obtained from mice was fixed in 3.7% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 
Five-micrometer sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin Y (H&E stain). 
Statistical analysis 
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 
Student's t-test were used. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

The TNF-α producing cells 
Rare TNF-α+ cells were detected in the liver using immunohistochemical staining (data not 
shown). We then checked blood cells using an in vitro whole-blood-culture model. LPS (5 μg/mL) 
increased the expression of mean TNF-α in whole-blood-culture to 75 pg/mL (mean value) in 1.5 h. 
Although lead (1 μM) itself did not induce detectable TNF-α, it significantly increased the 
TNF-α-inducing effect of LPS, which then reached approximately 125 pg/mL (Figure 4A). Because 
CD14+ macrophages/monocytes have been documented as a major source of TNF-α (Haziot et al. 
1996), we analyzed the CD14+ cells in the whole-blood-culture after Pb+LPS co-exposure. Using 
flowcytometric analysis, we determined whether CD14+ cells were the primary TNF-α-secreting 
cells in blood. The cells were stained with PE-anti-CD14 and FITC-anti-TNF-α after stimulation. 
TNF-α+/CD14+ cells (5.9%) were separated from single negative cells (Figure 4B, upper-right 
quadrant). Intracellular TNF-α stain showed that fewer than 8% of the CD14+ cells were in 
untreated- or lead-treated whole-blood-culture. Approximately 12% of the CD14+ cells in the LPS 
group were also TNF-α+. Co-exposure to lead and LPS increased the TNF-α+ cells to about 20% of 
the CD14+ cells (Figure 4C). 
Macrophages/monocytes mediating Pb+LPS-induced liver injury 
To confirm whether Pb+LPS-induced liver injury involves macrophages/monocytes, we 
inactivated macrophages/monocytes using GdCl3 (40 mg/kg) 24 h before Pb+LPS treatment. Mouse 
peritoneal macrophages that received GdCl3 were drastically reduced, and few cells expressed a 
high level of F4/80 (F4/80high), representing peritoneal macrophages in peritoneal exudate (data not 
shown). GdCl3 decreased the level of serum TNF-α in mice that had received Pb+LPS (Figure 5A). 
In parallel with a reduction in TNF-α, GdCl3 markedly decreased serum AST (Figure 5B) and ALT 
(Figure 5C) measured 24 h post Pb+LPS treatment. GdCl3 also reduced the number of 
hepatocellular lesions in mice that received Pb+LPS, as shown by reduced necrotic areas in the liver 
 9 
at 10 μM than at 1 μM. 
Using MAPK and PKC inhibitors, we demonstrated that p42/44 MAPK and PKC were 
involved in the Pb+LPS-induced TNF-α expression of peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. 
At doses between 7.5 and 30 μM, U0126, a p42/44 MAPK inhibitor, significantly suppressed the 
Pb+LPS-induced expression of TNF-α. (Figure 8B and E). At a dose of 5 μg/ml, Ch, a PKC 
inhibitor, also reduced Pb+LPS-associated TNF-α expression (Figure 8C and F).

cell signaling. PKC and p42/44 MAPK are downstream signals of lead stimulation in neurons (Olivi 
et al. 2003), bone-marrow-derived macrophages (Flohe et al. 2002), and glioma cells (Cheng et al. 
2004), and they may regulate genes responding to lead poisoning. Long-term exposure to lead leads 
to PKC activation in rat livers; however, lead also inhibited the activity of PKCα in a human 
hepatoma cell line (Liu et al. 1997; Tonner and Heiman 1997), and the inhibition was much more 
pronounced when lead levels were high (Sun et al. 1999). Because circulating lead will quickly 
deposit in the liver (Bornemann and Colburn 1985), we speculated (Cheng and Liu 2005) that a 
transient accumulation of lead in the liver will suppress the activation of PKC and p42/44 MAPK in 
hepatocytes. Lead or LPS alone at the doses we used did not alter the phosphorylation of p42/44 
MAPK in HepG2 cells (data not shown). In addition, in our animal model, we did not find 
phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK in hepatocytes, further indicating that they were not induced to 
produce TNF-α in response to lead exposure. In contrast to liver cells, co-exposure to lead and LPS 
significantly stimulated p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation in peritoneal macrophages; suppressing 
p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation or inhibiting PKC activity resulted in reduced TNF-α expression. 
As mentioned earlier, both lead and a high dose of LPS activated PKC and MAPK, which 
stimulated TNF-α expression (Cheng et al. 2004). In our study model, the synergistic effect of 
Pb+LPS was demonstrable: co-exposing mice to Pb+LPS strongly induced TNF-α expression in 
peritoneal macrophages and in whole blood of mouse. In addition, significant interaction between 
the LPS-treatment factor and lead-dose factor was indicated by dose-dependent TNF-α expression 
in different groups of RAW264.7 cells. Although lead alone or LPS alone slightly increased the 
phosphorylation of MAPK in peritoneal macrophages, only co-exposing them to Pb+LPS induced 
obvious p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-α expression. Apparently, the minimal level of 
MAPK activation required to induce a large amount of TNF-α was higher than the levels of MAPK 
in cells after exposure to a single dose of lead alone or LPS alone. After the signals initiated by 
Pb+LPS merged in the PKC and MAPK pathway, MAPK activation was sufficient for TNF-α
