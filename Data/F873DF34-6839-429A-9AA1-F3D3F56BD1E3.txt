Abstract (Keywords : Millimeter-wave, W-band, 
D-band, HEMT, MMIC) 
    This project is proposing the development of 
monolithic millimeter-wave (MMW) components 
from 100 to 170 GHz using GaAs or InP-based 
HEMT MMIC process technologies (e.g. 0.15 or 
0.1-μm gate-length HEMT).  The MMIC 
components will include amplifiers, mixers, 
doublers, modulators, and oscillators, as well as 
some passive and control components, such as 
switches and baluns, etc. 
In this 3-year project, device model, MMIC 
design, chip layout, fabrication and chip 
evaluation will all be exercised.  In this report, 
we present the experimental results for the three 
years in this project.  The switches, harmonic 
mixer, voltage control oscillator, BPSK 
modulators, amplifier, and doubler are 
successfully designed and fabricated for D-band 
applications.  
 
二. 研究計畫之背景及目的 
Millimeter-wave (MMW) frequency (30 - 
300 GHz) transceiver will play a very import role 
in the next generation's wireless communication 
systems.  There are many MMW MMIC 
components, including low noise amplifiers, 
power amplifiers, mixers and oscillators reported 
in US, Japan, and European countries [1]-[6] for 
MMW radar, communication and radiometer 
applications.  In this project, we will try to use 
the advanced technologies to investigate the 
feasibility of MMIC components above 100 GHz.  
We will start from W-band (75-110 GHz) 
frequency and target for the D-band (110-170 
GHz) frequency in this new proposed three-year 
project.  The objective of this project is to 
establish the design and modeling techniques for 
MMW MMIC above 100 GHz and up to 170-GHz 
frequency range.   
 
三. 研究方法與結果 
In this research, the procedures of MMW MMIC 
development are presented as follows. 
 
(1) Establish design goal of each component.   
(2) Device model investigation.   
(3) Passive model library establishment.   
(4) Circuit topology trade study and initial 
circuit design.   
(5) Circuit simulation, detailed design and 
layout.   
(6) Circuit fabrication and evaluation.   
 
In these three years, we have followed the 
above-mentioned procedure to develop to 170 
GHz transceiver MMIC components.  The chip
