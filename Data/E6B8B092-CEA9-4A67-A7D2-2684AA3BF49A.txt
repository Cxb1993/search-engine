Abstract 
This research project is concerned with determining the optimal production lot-size for economic 
production quantity (EPQ) model with backordering, rework of repairable defective items and 
random machine breakdown. In most real-life production processes, machine breakdown and 
random defective rate are two most common and inevitable reliability factors that trouble the 
production practitioners most. It is no wonder that these reliability issues have received attentions 
among researchers in recent decades. 
This study examines the aforementioned EPQ model with machine breakdown taking place 
during the backorder-replenishing period. Abort/resume inventory control policy is adopted. In 
addition to the assumption of breakdown, rework process for random defective items produced is 
also assumed in this study. Mathematical modeling and cost analysis are employed. The renewal 
reward theorem is used to cope with the variable cycle length. Convexity of the long-run average 
cost function is proved and an optimal manufacturing lot-size that minimizes the expected overall 
costs is derived. A simple illustrating example is provided. Because the classic EPQ model does not 
consider machine breakdown and rework of random defective items, so it cannot be of assistance in 
solving such a realistic production system. These real-life reliability situations must be specifically 
studied in order to minimize the overall production-inventory costs. Since little attention was paid 
to this area, this project intends to bridge the gap.

the interrupted lot will be resumed right after the restoration of machine.

It is also assumed that during the setup time, prior 
to the production uptime, the working status of 
machine is fully checked and confirmed. Hence, the 
chance of breakdown in a very short period of time 
when production begins is small. It is also assumed 
that due to tight preventive maintenance schedule, 
the probability of more than one machine breakdown 
occurrences in a production cycle is very small. 
However, if it does happen, safety stock will be used 
to satisfy the demand during machine repairing time. 
Therefore, multiple machine failures are assumed to 
have insignificant effect on the proposed model. 
Figure 1 illustrates the on-hand inventory of perfect 
quality items in the proposed EPQ. 
Cost parameters considered in the proposed model 
include: unit production cost C, setup cost K, unit 
holding cost h, repair cost for each defective item 
reworked CR, unit holding cost per reworked item h1, 
disposal cost per scrap item CS, unit shortage/ 
backordered cost b, and cost for repairing and 
restoring machine M. Other notation used is listed as 
follows. 
T1 = optimal production uptime, the decision 
variable to be solved in the study, 
t = production time before a random breakdown 
occurs, 
H1 = the level of backorder quantity when machine 
breakdown occurs, 
tr = time required for repairing and restoring the 
machine, 
H2 =  the level of backorder quantity when machine 
is repaired and restored, 
tr’ = time required for producing sufficient stocks to 
satisfy the demand during machine repair time 
tr, 
t5 = time required for filling the backorder quantity 
B (excluding tr and tr’), 
t1 = time for piling up stocks during the production 
uptime in each cycle, 
H3 = the level of perfect quality inventory when 
regular production process ends, 
t2 = time needed to rework (1-θ) of the repairable 
defective items, 
H4 = maximum level of perfect quality inventory 
when rework finishes, 
t3 = time required for depleting all available perfect 
quality on-hand items, 
t4 = shortage permitted time, 
T = the production cycle length, 
Q = production lot size for each cycle, 
B = maximum backorder level allowed each cycle, 
TC(T1,B) = total production-inventory costs per 
cycle, 
TCU(T1,B) = total production-inventory costs per 
unit time (e.g. annual),

Total production-inventory cost per cycle TC(T1,B)

Due to the random defective/scrap rates and a 
uniformly distributed breakdown is assumed to occur 
in the backorder filling period, the production cycle 
length is not constant. Thus, to take the randomness 
of scrap rate and breakdown into account, one can 
employ the renewal reward theorem in 
production-inventory cost analysis to cope with the 
variable cycle length and use the integration of 
TC(T1,B) to deal with the random breakdown 
happening in period t5. The long-run expected costs 
per unit time can be calculated as follows.

2.1 Convexity of Cost Function E[TCU(T1,B)] 
The optimal replenishment policy can be obtained by 
minimizing expected cost function E[TCU(T1,B)]. 
For the proof of convexity of E[TCU(T1,B)], one can 
use the Hessian matrix equations [19] and verify the 
existence of the following:

(21) 
The expected production-inventory cost function 
E[TCU(T1,B)] is strictly convex only if Eq. (21) is 
satisfied for all T1 and B different from zero. From 
Eqs. (20) and (21) by computing all the elements of 
the Hessian matrix equation, one obtains Eq. (22). 
And it is resulting positive, because all parameters 
are positive. Hence, E[TCU(T1,B)] is a strictly 
convex function. 
For locating the optimal production uptime T1 and 
optimal backorder quantity B, one can differentiate 
the expected production-inventory cost function 
E[TCU(T1,B)] with respect to T1 and with respect to 
B, and then solve linear systems of Eqs.(23) and (24) 
by setting these partial derivatives equal to zero. The 
resulting optimal T1* and B* are shown in Eqs.(25) 
and (26).

into Eq. (20), one has E[TCU(T1,B)]= $4,819.36. 
This results a 5.64% more on total setup and 
holding costs than the optimal production- inventory 
costs calculated from the present study.

4 Conclusion 
This research investigates the optimal replenishment 
policy for EPQ model with rework and breakdown 
taking place in backorder refilling time. Because the 
classic EPQ model is not sufficient for solving such a 
practical system, effects of these reliability situations 
on EPQ model must be specifically studied in order 
to minimize the total production-inventory costs. 
Mathematical modeling is used and convexity of 
the long-run average cost function is proved. Then an 
optimal production lot size that minimizes the 
long-run average costs for such an imperfect quality 
EPQ model is derived, where shortages are allowed 
and backordered. Since little attention was paid to 
the aforementioned area, this paper intends to bridge 
the gap. For future study, incorporating a random 
repair time for breakdown into the similar imperfect 
EPQ model may be one of the interesting studies.
