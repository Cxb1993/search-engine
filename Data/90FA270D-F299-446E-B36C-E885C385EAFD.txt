摘 要  
 
傳統高階積分三角調變器的設計上，主要是依賴行為模擬的方法。然而此方法實在相當耗時。
本成果是第一個提出使用模組化設計的方法去設計積分三角調變器。在時間上，使用模組化的
設計方法將會比使用行為模擬的方法快上萬倍。由於之前非理想雜訊及失真模型不完備，模組
化設計的方法一直無法真正的去實現。現在，因為積分器充放電雜訊模型以及放大器的非線性
直流增益諧波失真模型的推出，使得模組化設計方法得以實現。然而，使用模組化設計將會遭
遇到雜訊相依的問題；本成果提出雜訊相依模型以便解決這個問題。除此之外，本成果也同時
提出積分三角調變器最佳化設計流程。相對於兩篇積分三角調變器設計實例，模組化積分三角
調變器最佳化設計將可以使用更短的時間去達到更高的訊號對雜訊以及失真比，同時降低積分
三角調變器的功率消耗。

A. Finite OTA Gain Error 
For a general single-loop nth order   modulator 
with finite OTA gain A, the modified quantization noise is 
expressed as [18]

gain of the integrator at the first stage, and   is the 
quantizer step size. The 
AVP  in (1) is due to finite OTA 
gain, and can be considered as an additive quantization 
noise power. 
 
B. Thermal Noise (Switch, OTA, Reference circuits) 
There are three thermal noise sources in the   
modulator, in MOS switches, OTAs and reference voltage. 
The analyses are shown separately as follows. 
The total output switches thermal noise power from the 
switched capacitor integrator is [18, 23]

Next, we consider the integration phase shown in Fig.5 (b), 
where the B2  unit capacitors are combined into SC , and 
the B2  DAC switches are neglected. The charge stored in 
sampling capacitor will be added to the integration 
capacitor and this charge current is supplied by OTA. So 
when the slew rate and gain bandwidth are not large 
enough, the settling error 
2  will be produced. The 
statistical properties of 
SV  have been summarized in 
Table I. Then, according to Fig. 7, three types of settling 
conditions can happen in the integrator output during this 
phase, and the corresponding voltage errors of these three 
conditions are [14] 
1. Linear settling: When the initial change rate of the 
integrator output voltage (
oV ) is smaller than the OTA 
slew rate ( SR ).

In order to estimate settling noise in this phase, we must

conditions defined by (13)-(15). The probability of

the average linear settling noise power in the integration

Sin24  is the noise transfer function for D2 
[40]. The larger the OSR , the more effective noise 
shaping is. For the case that 1
st

nd
 stage integrators 
are identical, Fig. 9 compares 1
st
 and 2
nd
 stage settling 
noise powers vs. OSR, which shows that the second-stage 
settling error is at least 22 to 36 dB less than that of the 
first stage. 
 
D. Multi-bit DAC noise 
There are several advantages in using a multi-bit  
structure, which are discussed in [33, 34]. Due to CMOS 
process variations, there can be mismatches in the B2  
unit capacitors 
u
C  of a B-bit DAC shown in Fig. 4. 
Assume that each unit capacitor distribution is Gaussian 
[35] around a nominal value. Let the normalized

In order to reduce DAC error due to unit capacitor

most efficient among these is the Data Weighted 
Averaging (DWA) [36], and it is shown in [37] that the 
DWA effect is a first-order noise shaping of the DAC 
noise. If the DWA is employed, the average DAC noise 
power at the modulator output is modified to be

Equations (33) and (34) will be used to estimate the DAC 
noise power in the optimization process. 
      
E. Clock Jitter Effects 
As both the signal bandwidth and the required output 
SNR increase, clock jitter problems become more obvious. 
Jitter is usually defined as a random variation in clock 
signal period around the ideal value, and the value of jitter 
can be reasonably assumed as a Gaussian random variable 
with zero mean and standard deviation
jit . If there is   
some variation in clock high time, the input signal will be 
sampled at the wrong instant and receive a consequent 
voltage error. For a sinusoidal input signal with maximum 
amplitude 
inA  and frequency inf , if it is sampled by a 
clock which has a jitter variation, then the voltage error is

We consider the worst case in this work. That is, 
inf  
and 
inA  are replaced by Bf  and refV  respectively. 
More discussions about tolerable 
jit  will be given in the 
next section. 
 
We summarize the nonideality modeling as follows. The 
leakage noise due to finite OTA gain can be considered as 
an additional quantization noise, so the total quantization 
noise will be higher than theoretical quantization noise, 
appearing at D3 in Fig. 10. All other nonidealities in the 
first stage are modeled at D1 in Fig. 10, because we have 
modeled them as input-referred noise in the integrator 
input. 
 
F. Relative Power Model 
In order to understand how   modulator power 
consumption is related to different circuit parameters, we 
must derive the power dissipation equation. Some 
derivations of this are based on the results presented in [23, 
24, 25]. It is difficult to estimate real system level power 
consumption, so our goal is not to estimate the absolute 
value of the power, but to find how power changes with 
circuit parameters, it is called the relative power 
consumption. Typically,   ADC power consumption is 
categorized into analog and digital parts. The power 
dissipation in the quantizer is also considered. We analyze 
optimization methodology is shown in Fig. 11. The input 
signal bandwidth (Hz) and the output signal SNR (dB) are 
treated as design specifications. We modify the 
figure-of-merit (FOM) [40] function by multiplying a 
variable K to the SNR term of FOM, to become our 
weighting function.

        (46) 
The design optimization algorithm basically searches 
through the entire parameter space to find the set of 
design parameters which maximize the Weighting 
Function. By maximizing the Weighting Function we can 
increase SNR (45) and reduce Power (44) at the same 
time.  
The constant K serves as the relative weighting between 
SNR and Power. Typically, if we prefer high resolution 
designs, we set K higher and SNR plays a more important 
role than Power; on the other hand, if we prefer low 
power designs, we can set K lower. After an design 
optimization process, the set of design parameters 
resulting in the largest Weighting Function value is the 
outcome and is evaluated. If not acceptable, the K is 
adjusted and the design optimization process is repeated. 
The parameter searching space is specified to be 
 OSR : 8 ~ 128 
 B : 1 ~ 6 (if 3, DEM is required) 
 n : 1 ~ 3 
 R : 100 Ω ~ 300 Ω

  The parameters 
cap  and refV depend on the 
technology, so they are set before the design optimization. 
The tolerable value of jitter standard deviation 
jit  can 
be specified after the optimization process. During the 
design optimization process, the gain coefficients ia  are 
specified according to the rules provided in [43]. 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In order to demonstrate the accuracy and practicability 
of our method, we apply it to two published design cases 
[5, 28]. In addition, we compare our method with existing 
behavior-simulation-based optimization schemes [48, 49].  
 
A.   ADC for ADSL-CO Applications 
To compare with the design of [5], the design 
optimization algorithm uses the same specifications as 
those in [5]. They are: 
 Peak SNR : 82 dB 
 Signal bandwidth : 276 kHz 
  The OTA gain A  is set at 60 dB and the 
refV  is set at 
0.9 V for a 1.8 V power supply in 0.18-μm CMOS 
technology. The matching of capacitor 
cap  is set at 
0.04% for the MIM capacitance. The results published in 
[5] and those obtained from our methodology are all listed 
in Table III, which includes three design optimization 
results corresponding to K=0.3, K=0.6, and K=0.7. From

TABLE Ⅴ  List of the details of power consumption 
  
Table III, when K=0.6, the result of SNR = 83.3 dB 
satisfies the specification, although the Power = 3.7 mW is 
higher than Power = 3.0 mW when K=0.3. The results 
from higher K are also reported. When K=0.7, the power 
consumption is dramatically larger at 26.2 mW, due to the 
fact that the DEM is employed and B is larger. We choose 
the case K=0.6 (with SNR=83.3) as our design. The SNR 
generated from the SIMULINK behavior simulation is 
also included in Table III.  
The design of [5] is also listed in Table III. The SNR and 
Power of [5] listed in Table III are computed from our 
models. The SR and GBW used in [5] are considerably 
larger than those of our design. According to Table Ⅷ in 
the Appendix A, the values SR = 500 S
V
  and GBW = 
400MHz are barely enough for OSR = 8, but are more than 
adequate for OSR = 16. Since the OSR in [5] is designed to 
be 96, the SR and GBW values used in [5] are too large

specification in [28]. Compared with the design in Case A, 
several points are worth mentioning. Although our GBW 
and SR in Case A are much smaller than the published 
ones [5], they are larger than the published ones [28] in 
Case B. This helps to avoid the impression that our 
method produces extreme results. Table Ⅳ shows that the 
dominating noise power in Case A is 
dacP , while Table Ⅶ 
shows that in Case B the dominating power is 
swP . A 
reason is that the DEM is employed in Case B, but not in 
Case A. 
  
C. Comparisons with Existing Optimization Schemes 
Behavioral simulation based optimization strategy is 
popular for   ADC design [48, 49]. The comparisons 
between our method and general behavioral simulation 
methods are summarized as follows. 
 
1.  Our method can be hundreds of times faster. We 
compare the CPU times required for each method to 
generate the SNR for a specific point in the parameter 
space (Measurement platform: Intel Pentium D, 2.8GHz 
CPU). To make a fair comparison, both methods are 
implemented under Matlab-Simulink environment. For 
our approach, the SNR in (45) is computed by a Matlab 
program (originally implemented in Mathmatica). The 
CPU time is 62.5 ms. For behavior simulation approach, 
a 16384 point simulation is run under Simulink, and the 
total CPU time is 13.01 seconds, Our method is 208.2 
times faster. 
2.  The optimization result from behavior simulations 
provides only the total noise power, while our method 
can generate each individual noise power as is listed in 
Table IV and Table Ⅶ, which provides greater insights 
and can serve several practical purposes. For example, 
suppose the design objective is not met even after the 
optimization process. The simulation approach might 
shed little clue about how things can be tackled. On the 
other hand, our result would indicate which noise power 
is the dominating one, and a different technology can be 
adopted to reduce that particular noise. 
3.  The disadvantage of our method is low flexibility, 
because equations may be modified every time when the 
topology is changed. In contrast, it is generally 
straightforward to simulate various   modulator 
architectures by properly linking building blocks into 
appropriate forms.  
V. CONCLUSION 
The main contributions of this work are described in the 
following. First, a settling error model of the switched 
capacitor integrators in   modulators is constructed 
using statistical analysis. This model considers settling 
errors in both the sampling and integration phases, 
represented in noise-power form. We also derive the DAC 
noise-power model. Additionally, we make modifications 
to existing noise-power models of other noises, 
particularly to thermal noise models. The noise-power 
models of all major noises and errors are established in 
Section II, and the SNR is defined in (45) accordingly. 
Second, based on nonideality models and the relative 
power model, we propose an optimization algorithm in 
Section III. In contrast to the complexity and difficulty 
encountered in the conventional   modulator design 
approach, this algorithm can completely and efficiently 
search the entire design parameters space to find the 
parameter set which satisfies the specifications, while 
achieving the lowest power consumption. Third, the 
complete models allow for analytical evaluation of design 
results, whether they are generated from our algorithm or 
designed elsewhere. For example, information provided in 
Table IV and V can reveal which noise or power is the 
dominating factor. Then, the models in Section II can help 
find design parameters behind the dominating factor. 
Fourth, our optimization method can be hundreds of times 
faster than existing behavioral simulation based 
approaches. 
This paper works on optimization of SNR, not SNDR. 
For radio and communication applications, maximize 
SNDR becomes an important issue. We are currently 
working on creating a complete set of nonlinear distortion 
models, so that SNDR optimization can be realized. 
 
APPENDIX A: Settling Distortion Model 
 
In a  modulator, nonlinear distortions can be 
categorized into op-amp gain nonlinearity distortion [18, 
23, 46], settling distortion [18, 42, 46], nonlinear 
capacitances distortion [18, 23], quantizer nonlinearity 
distortion [34], nonlinear switch resistance distortion [23, 
32] and DAC distortion [34, 37, 44, 45]. It can be verified 
that settling distortion is the sole distortion which can be 
significantly affected by op-amp slew rate (SR) and 
gain-bandwidth (GBW). There was a great effort in [46] to 
model settling distortion. However the result in [46] 
reached a wrong conclusion, and it showed little insight 
about how SR and GBW are quantitatively related to 
settling distortion. In this appendix, we provide a 
comprehensive model for settling distortion. This model is 
used in section IV to explain why the SR and GBW in [5] 
are too large, but the SR and GBW obtained in our design 
are adequate. 
Consider the integrator operates in the integration phase. 
As discussed in section II, there are three settling 
conditions depending on the absolute value of 
SV .

Fig. 15. 
In general, harmonic distortion less than -110dB can be 
ignored because it is below the noise floor of modulator 
output spectrum. From (60), Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, we can 
obtain the minimum required SR and GBW w.r.t. a specific 
OSR. The results are summarized in Table Ⅷ. It is clear 
from Table Ⅷ that as OSR decreases, SR and GBW have to 
increase dramatically so that the effect of settling 
distortion can be contained. This can be explained by (59), 
since T increases when OSR decreases.
