4.2. Testing procedure 
All specimens were firstly applied axial 
compression force and remained at the level 
cg fA213.  during the test. Then, they 
were exerted lateral load under displacement control 
with the same lateral drift ratio θ. The lateral drift 
ratio θ is defined as the ratio of the horizontal 
displacement θ to the test length L: 
P ′0
  Drift angle 
L
Δ=θ   
 The specimens were subjected to 3 successive 
cycles when θ is less than or equal to 1%, then 2 
successive cycles when θ is larger 1%. This 
procedure is shown in Fig. 6. The actuator applied 
input displacements in a quasi-static manner with the 
speed of approximately 0.5mm/sec. The testing was 
terminated after the specimens’ strength dropped 
below 85% of the maximum value. 
 
5. Test results 
5.1. General behavior 
The lateral load H versus horizontal 
displacement Δ relationship (hysteresis loops) for 10 
specimens are shown in Fig.7. Specimens D1-X1, 
D1-X1-C, D1-X2, D1N-X2, X-D1N-X2, D2-X2, 
D2-X2-C and D2-X3 were loaded up to 28 cycles in 
total, with the maximum lateral drift ratio θ = 8%. 
The remaining two specimens D2-Y2 and D2-Y3 
were subjected to 26 cycles with the maximum 
lateral drift ratio θ = 7%. 
 
5.2. Failure mode and strength deterioration 
The strength reduction of specimens can be 
described as follows: after spalling of concrete cover, 
increasing lateral displacement led to buckling of 
longitudinal steel bars. These caused loss in 
confinement of the core concrete, and subsequently 
rupture of steel bars. Eventually, the specimen 
suffered strength deterioration which was below 
85% of maximum value. Strength ratio after θ = 6% 
for each specimen was shown in Fig.8. 
• D1-X1 and D1-X1-C: By the end 8% 2nd 
cycle, D1-X1-C which had CAP deteriorated less 
strength than D1-X1 by about 5%. 
• D1-X2 and D1N-X2: From θ = 6% to 7%, 
D1-X2 which had larger flange width displayed 
better strength ratio. 
• D1N-X2 and X-D1N-X2: By the end of the 
test, the strength dropped 17.16% for X-D1N-X2 
was less than 20.8% of specimen D1N-X2. This can 
be attributed to better confined core concrete of 
X-D1N-X2. 
• D1-X2 and D2-X2: Although they had the 
same sfA yhsh / , D1-X2 which had deeper steel 
shape section reduced less strength than D2-X2. 
During θ = 6%, 7% and 8%, it could keep 98.4%, 
92.96% and 79.79% of its strength, which are higher 
than those of D2-X2 by about 4%, 6% and 5%. 
• D2-X2 and D2-X2-C: By the end of the test, 
D2-X2 exhibited a larger loss in strength compared 
to D2-X2-C, although the difference (3%) is not so 
significant. 
• D2-X2 and D2-X3: Across from θ = 6% to 
8%, D2-X2 suffered more strength deterioration than 
D2-X3. Especially by the end of θ = 8%, D2-X2 lost 
25.02% of Hmax, which is much more than 14.87% of 
D2-X3. 
• D2-Y2 and D2-Y3: with these specimens 
bent about weak axis, although the strength was 
improved, the behavior looked like reinforced 
concrete columns. The strength reduction after peak 
load is approximately the same. 
 
5.3. Energy dissipation 
Fig. 9 shows the cumulative energy dissipation 
of each specimen during the test. From Fig.9, we can 
obtain that: specimen D1-X1, D1-X1-C and D1-X2 
displayed the highest energy absorption capacity, 
followed by D1N-X2, X-D1N-X2, D2-X2, D2-X2-C 
and D2-X3. Two specimens which were bent about 
weak axis had lowest dissipated energy. 
 
5.4. Displacement ductility ratio μΔ and 
plastic hinge rotation θp 
Displacement ductility ratio μΔ = Δu /Δy. Where 
Δy is yield displacement, Δu is ultimate displacement. 
Plastic hinge rotation θp was calculated according to 
the following equation [7]. Where L is the test length 
and Lp is the plastic hinge length 
 - 2 -
3. The specimens with the amount of 
transverse steel bars, which is based on the design 
concept, still exhibited quite good behavior. At 
about cg fA ′213. of axial compressive load level, it 
can be applied conservatively to determine the 
required transverse steel bars. 
0
4. With the same amount of transverse steel 
bars, NSRC not only achieved higher flexural 
strength, but also showed higher θp and lower 
strength deterioration rate. 
5. It seems that the CAP used was able to 
improve seismic behavior of NSRC and TSRC 
columns in terms of reducing strength deterioration 
rate. In addition, CAP also enhances μΔ and θp for 
NSRC columns. 
6. Use of steel shape with wider flange can 
result in higher strength and less pinching behavior. 
7. Specimens using H or XH for 
cross-sectional steel shape section had quite the 
same maximum flexural strength. However, the one 
which used XH shape exhibited less strength 
deterioration, less pinching behavior, and larger θp. 
8. For specimens bent about weak axis, 
increase of the amount of transverse steel bars did 
not lessen strength deterioration rate, but it improved 
μΔ, θp, and reduced pinching behavior. 
 
6.2. Suggestions 
1. The required amount of transverse steel bars 
for SRC columns should be less than that for RC 
columns. However, it is necessary to have more 
researches doing on that issue to obtain more 
evidences. 
2. The confinement effect provided by flange 
of steel shape is still not clarified clearly. We should 
have more experiments to investigate how the 
ff tb /  ratio influences on seismic behavior of SRC 
columns. 
3. If possible, it was suggested that using XH 
section for steel shape rather than H section. This 
type of section not only has advantages in reducing 
strength deterioration rate, increasing plastic hinge 
rotation, but also can avoid using extra stirrups.
