4Abstract
In the production economics context the input congestion is defined as whenever increasing one or more
inputs will decrease some outputs without improving other inputs or outputs. Since some firms in practice
may exhibit overstaffing or over-capitalizing in producing their products, it thus makes sense to consider the
effects of input congestion while measuring technical efficiency for firms. Previous works, however, generally
did not take into account the effects of congestion on performance evaluation until Färe et al. (1985,
hereinafter, FGL) and Cooper et al. (2001, hereinafter, CGL). Based on the literature, we note that the
measurement of congestion has been the issue of debate and the debate is not yet conclusive. CGL claimed
that standard procedure to deal with congestion in DEA by FGL can either fail to identify congestion when it
is actually present or mistakenly identify congestion when it is not really present. Färe and Grosskopf (2000),
however, have pointed out that FGL and CGL approaches differ most fundamentally--FGL used a radial
Farrell (1957) measure while CGL applied a slack-based approach to detect and measure congestion and to
identify the input(s) responsible for congestion.
This study measures the output-oriented technical efficiency and input congestion with consideration of
categorical variables for railway transport by using DEA extension approach. The empirical results from some
selected 24 EU railways show that 13 railways are evaluated as presence of weak congestion. Based on the
results of identifying the source(s) of input congestion and further determining its amount, one can obtain
more insight to railways’ operationand thus propose more effective strategies for improvement.

6efficiency, SE)，詳見Banker et al. (BCC, 1984)及Banker (1984)的論述。以下詳述說明二項效率之意涵：
(1)技術效率：Farrell (1957)認為，在相同技術水準，當所有投入要素在不減少產出量情況下已不能再
減少，或在不增加投入要素情況下產出量已不能再增加，則表示受評估單位(Decision making unit, DMU)
為有效率，其效率值為1；若DMU尚可再減少投入量，或尚可再增加產出量，表示一部分投入資源有
被浪費掉情形，則其效率值小於1，表示未達技術效率。(2)規模效率：規模效率為用以衡量組織生產規
模是否處於最佳規模狀態，亦即平均產量為最大的狀態。
至於「擁擠」(Congestion)之定義，一般泛指過多之要素集中在一狹小的空間，造成生產行為受到
干擾甚至阻礙。例如倉庫內原有3輛堆高機供搬運貨物用，如果為了加快搬運率，而增加了1輛堆高機，
此時生產行為或許尚不致受到干擾，從而可提高搬運效率；但如果增加了10輛堆高機，則可能增加的
堆高機不僅沒提高搬運效率，反而造成堆高機運作不順暢，甚至有互相干擾必須等候情事，使得搬運
效率或單位時間之搬運量不增反減。在生產經濟學的領域中，最能夠解釋投入擁擠現象的例子，莫過
於農夫對於肥料之使用，肥料為增加作物產出之重要投入要素之一，適量使用肥料，可使產出增加，
但若使用過量，則作物容易枯萎，反而使產出量下降。因此，評估產業經營績效時，應一併考量有無
過多投入造成擁擠，致產出不增反減情形。Brockett et al. (1998) 認為投入擁擠表示吾人可減少某一項
投入，來讓一個或多個產出增加，同時不致使其他投入或產出劣化。Cooper et al. (2000) 亦指出若廠商
存在擁擠之現象，則可藉由減少投入要素而使產出增加。擁擠主要原因為投入要素過多或配置不當，
而造成技術嚴重無效率；如果投入過多但尚未造成擁擠，則指的是單純的技術無效率。
關於鐵路運輸效率評估，過去的研究甚多，例如，Gathon and Perelman (1992) 以隨機前緣分析法
(Stochastic frontier analysis, SFA)分析1961至1988年19個歐洲國家鐵路公司之效率，產出變數為客運列車
公里及貨運列車公里兩項，投入變數為平均載運距離、路線長、載客率、勞動、電氣化比率及自主權
六項。實證結果發現，影響鐵路公司之技術效率與是否具有營運管理自主權密切相關。Gathon and
Pestieau (1995)亦以SFA法衡量1961至1988年歐洲19個國家鐵路公司之效率，其選取之投入變數為機車
頭加車廂數、勞動人力數、未電氣化之路線長、已電氣化之路線長，至於產出變數則為延人公里與延
噸公里。研究結果顯示，荷蘭的鐵路公司(NS)最有效率，而丹麥的鐵路公司(DSB)效率值為最低。
Coelli and Perelman (1999)以參數化線性規劃法(Parametric linear programming)、修正最小平方法
(Corrected ordinary least squares)及DEA等三種方法評估1988至1993年歐洲17個國家之鐵路運輸事業之
營運效率，在評估模式中，勞動人力數、車輛數(機車頭加車廂數)、資本(路線長)三項為投入變數，至
於產出變數則為延人公里及延噸公里兩項，研究結果顯示各個鐵路公司之效率值因採用的分析方法不
同而有差異，作者因此建議如果是重要的政策最好採用多重評估方法，以免評估結果有偏誤。Cowie
(1999)以DEA法之BCC模式衡量1995年瑞士鐵路公司之效率，選取勞動、土地、資本(機車頭加車廂)與
路線長度四項投入變數，列車公里為產出變數，研究結果發現，在技術效率上私營鐵路公司優於公營
鐵路公司。Chapin and Schmidt (1999)亦以DEA法之CCR模式(Charnes et al., 1978)及BCC模式衡量美國
一級鐵路貨運業之績效，在評估模式中，其以路線長、員工、燃料量、車輛數及引擎馬力數五項為投
入變數，車英哩為產出變數，實證結果發現，鐵路業之間的合併並不一定能提高效率。
藍武王、林村基 (2003)衡量1999年世界74家鐵路公司之效率，並以SFA法及DEA法之CCR與BCC
模式評估，其投入變數為營運路線長度、車輛數及員工人數三項，產出變數為列車公里一項，研究結
果發現，技術無效率廠商主要源自過多車輛及人員之投入。Lin and Lan (2008)以DEA法評估2004年世
界64家鐵路公司之效率，在評估模式中，選取員工、客車數與貨車數三項為投入變數，至於產出變數
則為旅客延人公里及貨物延噸公里兩項。實證結果顯示，並非所有的無效率皆具有投入差額(Slack)，
8DMU之規模彈性(Scale elasticity, SE)，以驗證是否具有擁擠現象，再進一步判定DMU為強擁擠或弱擁
擠。綜觀上述三種方法，Tone and Sahoo (2004)在衡量投入擁擠前，先以規模彈性判別後，再衡量擁擠
值，相較之下此一方法顯然較其他兩種方法合理，因此本研究採用Tone and Sahoo (2004)所建議的方法
來評估歐盟鐵路是否具有擁擠之現象，下一節將說明Tone and Sahoo (2004)之分析方法。
四、研究方法
本研究採用Tone and Sahoo (2004)建議的方法來評估歐盟會員國鐵路公司是否有投入過多造成生
產擁擠現象。此法首先採用Banker et al. (1984)所提出的產出導向模式，來衡量各個DMU在投入固定下
產出可擴增的倍數()。假設有n個DMU ),...,1( nj ，每個DMU均使用m種投入 ),...,1( mixi  生產k種產

式中， rjy 為第j個DMU的第r項產出值， ijx 為第j個DMU的第i項投入值， j為第j個權數，  ss , 分
別為產出差額(Output slack)與投入差額(Input slack)， o為第o家DMU產出可擴增之比例，其倒數( o/1 )
則為第o家DMU的效率值。
為了求解模式中的投入差額及產出差額，Ali and Seiford (1993)建議採用兩階段方法，第一階段先
算出 o，第二階段再計算產出差額及投入差額，第二階段模式如下：

經求解 o及投入與產出差額後，Tone and Sahoo (2004)建議藉由以下四項條件來判別DMU有無投
入擁擠情形，此四項條件分別為：(1)若 1*  , 0* s 及 0* s ，則表示此公司有效率且無擁擠現象；
(2)若 1*  , 0* s 及 0* s ，則表示此公司技術無效率，因為多使用了投入，但因 0* s ，故尚無造

式中ur, vi為產出、投入之權重。求出規模彈性上界後，即可判斷DMU是否具有強擁擠，若 0 ，
表示該DMU無強擁擠，若 0 則表示該DMU具有強擁擠。此一階段的分析結果，雖DMU無強投入擁
擠，但不表示無弱投入擁擠。Tone and Sahoo (2004)定義弱投入擁擠為增加一種或一種以上的投入，造
成一種或一種以上產出減少。分析弱投入擁擠同樣需採用兩階段衡量模式，首先以下列線性規劃模式

計算出來的差額中，若 0*t 則表示無弱擁擠；若 0* t 表示有弱擁擠。接著計算邊際生產率

5.3 資料分析
表2顯示四項投入與兩項產出變數之敘述性統計，由資料中可知德鐵(DB)為歐盟國家各鐵路公司中
營運規模最大者，其不論是在員工人數(157,509人)、機車頭數量(4,161輛)、客車運能(1,362,252個座位)
與貨車運能(4,702,000噸)均為最大，且其貨運產出亦為最多(88,407百萬延噸公里)，但在客運產出方面，
則以法鐵(SNCF)最高(78,465百萬延人公里)，表示在員工人數、機車頭數量、客車運能等三項資源的使
用上，是否會影響整體營運之績效，為後續值得探討之課題。西歐的GKB(奧地利)在客運產出(120百萬
延人公里)及貨運產出(12百萬延噸公里)為最少，其員工人數(420人)與客車運能(2,355個座位)亦為最
少，雖投入少則產出理當較少，但是否因其另外兩項投入分配不當，間接導致產出減少，亦值得重視。
表2亦顯示，員工人數、機車頭數、客車運能、貨車運能、延人公里及延噸公里之標準差分別為：37,271、
1,363、381,243、1,255,395、22,214及19,456，顯示該24家樣本鐵路公司之營運規模具有差異，因此，
進一步檢定其是否來自同一母體，顯有必要。

註：延人公里、延噸公里之單位分別為百萬延人公里、百萬延噸公里。
在DEA的效率分析中，其前提假設是所有變數及權數均為正，且投入與產出變數之關係必須符合
同向性(Isotonicity)。因此，在進行效率分析前，必須先檢驗資料是否符合同向性。本研究採用Pearson
相關係數法來驗證，其結果詳如表3所示，按表3顯示，投入變數與產出變數皆呈正相關，介於0.676至
0.984之間，以雙尾檢定顯著水準0.01下，各變數之相關係數皆具顯著性，表示所選取之投入與產出變
數符合同向性之要求。在此必須說明的是，同向性表示產出與投入同向，係就投入與產出的關係整體
而言，此與個別廠商的個別投入項，在增加到一定程度後造成的生產擁擠有別。

本研究接著評估各DMU的產出擴增率，並進一步分析投入差額( s )與產出差額( s )，主要目的在
分析各DMU的資源使用情形，其結果如表5所示，整體而言，各鐵路公司產出擴增率平均為1.353，至
於可改善的投入項部分，機車頭數量與貨車運能之投入差額平均分別為170輛及171,541噸，在所有投
入項中有13家最多，表示機車頭數量與貨車運能在投入差額上最為嚴重；其次為員工人數，具有投入
差額者有7家，平均差額為1,626人，最後在客車運能方面，有6家鐵路具有投入差額，平均值為11,606
個座位。至於產出差額方面，延人公里與延噸公里分別有1家及2家具有產出差額，平均分別為22百萬
延人公里及170百萬延噸公里。
表5結果亦顯示，在部分鐵路公司產出擴增率等於1，且無投入差額與產出差額的DMU計有SNCF(法
國)、DB(德國)及RENFE(西班牙)等10家，表示無投入擁擠現象且為有效率；至於產出擴增率大於1但無
產出差額的DMU為CFL(盧森堡)、BDZ(保加利亞)、CFR(羅馬尼亞)等11家，表示該11個DMU為無效率；
另外，FS SpA (義大利)、OSE (希臘)與LG (立陶宛)的產出擴增率均大於1，且產出差額分別為3,803、
281百萬延噸公里及520百萬延人公里，表示產出不足，應該在不增加投入情況下設法增加產出。

以上分析之結果雖顯示無強擁擠情形，但並不代表不具有弱擁擠，因此本研究另以弱擁擠模式
(M7、M8)來評估歐盟鐵路公司是否具有弱擁擠，並藉由調整投射後新的投入產出組合來計算弱擁擠，
先計算產出短少額( t )與投入擁擠額( t )，最後以式(M9)之MPR來判斷是否具有弱擁擠現象。結果如表
7所示，整體而言，共有14家DMU之MPR為負值，也就是說14家具有弱擁擠現象，其中產出短少額( t )
方面，以延噸公里(14家)較延人公里(8家)為嚴重，其平均分別為2,585百萬延噸公里及1,351百萬延人公
里。至於投入擁擠數額( t )，以貨車運能(12家)與機車頭(12家)最為嚴重，平均分別為166,549噸與161
輛；其次為客車運能，計有9家DMU，擁擠數額平均為4,850個座位；投入擁擠數額最少為員工人數共4
家，其平均擁擠數額差額為527人。整體分析結果顯示，貨運投入資源的調整，應為改善效率的重點。

面臨極大之經營競爭壓力，未來可考慮適度減少員工人數，以提升效率，並降低經營成本。
就個別廠商而言，東歐的CFR (羅馬尼亞)的貨車運能與CD (捷克)的機車頭投入擁擠額最大，分別
為1,388,446公噸與1,225輛，表示貨車運能與機車頭為該兩公司首要改善之項目；另外在東歐的ZSSK
(斯洛伐克)的客車運能及MAV(匈牙利)的員工人數之投入擁擠為該項投入之最大者，分別為71,337個座
位及9,723人，顯示此兩鐵路公司分別在客車運能與員工人數投入之縮減或調整配置，為改善績效首要
之務。
實證分析結果顯示，具有弱擁擠現象的投入變數，以貨車運能12家最嚴重，擁擠值亦為所有投入
項中最大者，此可能原因應係該12家廠商的貨車車廂投入過多。一般而言鐵路貨運由於列車長度較長、
且行駛速度較慢，在路線容量有限的情況下，如貨車車廂投入過多，不免因佔據路線，使其他產出(例
如客運服務)減少，造成擁擠致生產效率降低。另外，歐盟的鐵路運輸需求市占率從1970年的32％，衰
退至1999年的12％(Lewis et al., 2001)，此項產出的衰退，若貨車車廂投入未因應調整，恐亦為導致擁
擠之原因。實證分析之管理意涵為：具有弱擁擠現象的14家鐵路公司，在投入固定之情況下，應設法
擴增產出，或是調整投入之配置，以改善目前經營無效率情況。
基本上鐵路運輸業有其營運特性，必須維持其最適生產規模(Most Productive Scale Size, MPSS)，
若規模過大，超過最適規模，則產出不增反減，「以機車頭數量」、「客車運能(即客車車廂數量)」、「貨
車運能(即貨車車廂數量)」為例，在有限空間之機廠(depot)、調車場(marshall yard)，甚或路線(正線、
支線)上，若上述車頭(車輛)太多，將會增加調度上的困難度，耗費更多時間才能分解組裝列車，甚至
於在部分僅有單股軌道(南下、北上共用同一軌道)，將增加在路線上(避車道上)停車等候的時間，從而
減少產出。
在歐洲大陸推行的車路分離政策，雖有助於鐵路營運效率的提升，但以另一個角度而言，此政策
或仍隱藏若干缺點，例如在有限的鐵路路線容量，可藉由貨車投入量的減少，使另一項(客運)產出增加，
將有助於投入擁擠額的減少，也就能提高整體效率。至於客運與貨運孰輕孰重，應為權衡(trade-off)之
課題。一般而言，鐵路貨運由於列車長度較長、且行駛速度較慢，再加上裝、卸貨物頗為耗時，又無
法提供戶到戶(door-to-door)的運輸服務，因此，鐵路貨運占營運比例高的公司，往往其相對效率均較
低，亦可能貨物載愈多虧損愈大，此由本研究貨車造成擁擠之分析結果，再度得到證實。因此，各鐵
路公司倘非政府政策要求，欲改善整體經營之效率，調整客貨運所占之營運比重，應為當前鐵路運輸
發展重要之課題。
實證結果發現，具有擁擠現象之鐵路公司大部分為東歐國家，共有8家。歐陽承新(2002)指出，在
1990年代初期後的數年，東歐各國先後陷入了科奈 (J. Kornrai)，此現象稱為轉型期間的衰退
(Transformation Recession)，無論是鐵路的貨運與客運運量上，均呈現快速下降的情形；另外Noreland
(2008)亦指出，在歐盟27國家的總內陸貨物運輸市場，自2000年至2006年間鐵路運輸市占率(噸公里)從
18％下降至17％，由這些現象足以證實，歐洲鐵路運輸在營運上的確效率不彰，尤其是東歐國家在整
體經營績效上需要改善的空間較大，未來東歐國家效率的改善的議題，應為值得進一步探討的課題。
由於資料取得限制，本研究僅暫分析2006年24家歐盟鐵路運輸公司投入要素之擁擠，建議未來研
究可進一步探討跨年期投入要素擁擠之變化，亦可將研究對象擴及歐盟以外，比較其他國家或地區鐵
路運輸公司投入要素之擁擠程度及變化情形，以了解其他國家或地區鐵路運輸是否亦普遍存有投入要
素擁擠現象，從而針對擁擠情況研提更具體之改善對策。

effect from output point of view; namely, we regard “input congestion” as whenever increasing one or more 
inputs will decrease some outputs without improving other inputs or outputs. The input congestion can further
be divided into two kinds: strong and weak, according to [8]. Strong congestion is regarded as an activity that
a proportionate reduction in all inputs will warrant an increase in all outputs; while weak congestion is
regarded as an activity such that uses less resources in one or more inputs for making more products in one or
more outputs. We believe that rail transport is very likely existent with input congestion, either strong or weak.
This study will conduct an empirical test on the efficiency and input congestion for some selected EU
railways. Using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) extension method, proposed by [8], we first evaluate
the technical efficiency and then detect if strong or weak congestion exhibit for the samples. For those
railways detected with input congestion, we further identify the sources and amounts of congestion, and then
propose more decisive strategies to correct the poor efficiency.
The remaining parts of this paper are arranged as follows. Section 2 reviews some relevant studies.
Section 3 describes the methodology. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Some discussions and
concluding remarks are addressed in the last section.
2. Literature Review
The data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, first developed by Charnes et al. [9], has been widely
used in performance evaluation. Many studies, including theoretical developments and practical applications,
have been published in literature in the past three decades. Since the DEA method has some advantages (e.g.,
one can handle multi-output multi-input production technologies without the need of specifying the functional
form in prior), many researchers measure the technical efficiency for railways by different DEA approaches.
For example, Oum and Yu [10] applied DEA to evaluate the eficiency of 19 OECD countries’ rail companies 
over the period of 1978 to 1989. Chapin and Schmidt [11] used the DEA to measure the efficiency of US
Class I railroad companies since deregulation. Cowie [12] also applied the DEA to compare the efficiency of
Swiss public and private railways by constructing technical and managerial efficiency frontiers and then
measured both efficiencies. Lan and Lin [13] further proposed a four-stage DEA model to evaluate rail
transport efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, and marketing capability. The aforementioned works have
endeavored to measure the performance of rail transport in the past; however, none have taken input
congestion effect into account.
Conventional DEA models implicitly assume that each firm can always freely dispose overused input
factors. The treatment of congestion of input factors in the technical efficiency measurement context was
probably pioneered by Färe and Svensson [14], who referred to Turgot’s “law of variable proportions”and
distinguished three different strengths of congestion of production factors, including output-limitational
congested, monotone output-limitational congested, and output-prohibitive congested. Färe et al. [4]
subsequently proposed an operational input-oriented weak disposal DEA model for dealing with input
congestion measurement. Using a slack-based DEA approach proposed by Cooper et al. [15], Brockett et al.
[16] estimated the inefficiency and amounts of input congestion in the Chinese empirical production before
and after the 1978 economy reforms. Their results indicated that textiles, chemicals and metallurgy industries
all exhibited input slacks due to the huge labor employment problem and all slacks of labor input in each
industry were attributed to congestion. Cooper et al. [6] also adopted same approach to identify congestive
inputs in Chinese textiles and automobiles industries. The results showed that elimination of managerial
inefficiencies could have led to output augmentation without reducing employment, and even in the heavily
congested textile industry, these output augmentations could have been accompanied by reductions in the
amounts of capital used. Tone and Sahoo [8] developed a new scheme to evaluate scale elasticity in the
presence of input congestion and then applied their new method to a data set obtained from the Japan Chain
Store Association. The results indicated that the Association had been operating under decreasing returns to
scale (DRS) for the last ten years. Their findings are useful for managers to reform their business.
Based on previous literature, we note that at least three methods for measuring the input congestion have
been developed: Färe-Grosskopf-Lovell (FGL) method by Färe et al.[4], Cooper-Thompson-Thrall (CTT)
method by Cooper et al. [15], and Tone-Sahoo (TS) method by Tone and Sahoo [8]. These three methods
differ most fundamentally--FGL method used a radial Farrell [17] measure, while CTT and TS methods used
a slack-based measure to identify the input(s) responsible for congestion. The key difference between CTT
and TS methods lie in the point of view--CTT method measures congestion in terms of excessive input(s)
while TS method in terms of output shortfall. In addition, TS method measures scale elasticity before

Banker et al. [18] showed that the optimal solution of o can be used to derive the scale economies. In

3.3 Measuring Strong Congestion
If a DMU is identified as congestive, then we may need to further find out the source(s) of congestion.
First, we define strong congestion as “an increase (decrease) in all inputs will lead to a decrease (increase) in
all outputs,”according to Tone and Sahoo [8]. Second, the efficiency under the strong disposability
assumption can be measured by the following LP:

where kq is output shortfall. Note that eq. (6) differs from eq. (1) in the second constraint where inequality
is replaced by equality. To find out kq , one has to use a two-stage method in the same manner as in eq. (2).
Similar to Banker et al. [18], the dual problem to eq. (6) can be formulated as follows:
26
following two cases. (1) If 0*kt , no weak congestion is detected since a decrease in inputs cannot increase
any output. (2) If 0* kt and 0*mt , then DMU is identified with weak congestion. In this case, Tone and
Sahoo [8] further defined an approximation to the marginal production rate (MPR), which can be viewed as a
proxy measure of scale elasticity. Tone and Sahoo [8] proposed to calculate the degree of scale economies
(DSE) by the following.

4. Empirical Study
4.1 The data
Our data set is drawn from International Railway Statistics, published by the International Union of
Railways [20]. Note that when applying DEA to evaluate the performance, the DMUs under consideration
should be homogeneous [21]. In this study we attempt to analyze the efficiency and identify possible source(s)
of input congestion of railways, we thus selected 24 railways in the 20 member countries of European Union.
All of these railways provide both passenger and freight services. Those railways without complete operation
data, such as ATOC (UK), CIE (Ireland), and providing only passenger or freight transport service, such as SJ
(Sweden), NS (Netherlands), DSB (Denmark), NIR (UK), and Eurostar (UK) are excluded from our data set.
Following Coelli and Perelman [22], [23], we choose passenger-kilometer and ton-kilometer as output
variables. As for the input variables, some studies selected number of employees, number of cars, and length
of lines as inputs. But we do not use length of lines because for rail transport industry, line-related facilities
such as tracks, signals, stations and yards can be viewed as sunk cost, which are generallyatributed to “fixed” 
costs. In this paper, we attempt to measure the efficiency of “variable” input factorsso as to identify the input
congestion. As for the input of rolling stock, because the passenger (freight) service cannot be produced by
freight (passenger) cars, therefore, instead of the sum of cars, we select available capacity of passenger
transport (in terms of number of seats), available capacity of freight transport (in terms of number of tonnages)
as two input factors. In addition, we also choose the number of employees and the number of locomotives as
the input variables. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the data, including four inputs and two
outputs.

Ton-kilometers (y2) 12 88,407 14,214 19,456
Note: y1 and y2 are in the unit of million.
4.2 The results
We estimate efficiency scores, slacks, and identify possible congestion for 24 samples by different DEA
models utilizing the software GAMS 2.50 [24]. The detailed analysis results for each DMU are presented in
Table 2 through Table 5. Based on the results and extended analysis, some important findings are summarized
and discussed as follows.
4.2.1 Testing homogeneity
To test the hypothesis of homogeneity, we classify the samples into two groups: Eastern Europe and
Western Europe. Each group has 12 railways and their efficiencies are evaluated by eq. (1)—BCC model; the
results are indicated in Table 2. Note that those DMUs evaluated as inefficient can be brought into efficient by
projection as defined by **** ,   syysxx oooo  . After projection, re-evaluate the efficiency by pooling
all samples together, the efficiency and its ranking are also displayed in Table 2.
To test whether there is significant difference between Eastern and Western Europe, Mann-Whitney U
test is adopted. The mean )( w , standard deviation )( w , and z-value are 150, 17.32, and 1.38, respectively.

4.2.3 Strong congestion and week congestion
To investigate strong congestion, we measure the efficiency and output shortfall under the assumption of
strong disposability (eq. (6)). The results, including efficiency (), output shortfall ( q ), and scale elasticity
() are presented in Table 4. As can be seen from Table 4, all railways are evaluated as weakly efficient (with
=1, and q =0) with exceptions of SNCB (Belgium) and SZ (Slovakia). Furthermore, the upper bounds of
scale elasticities are all greater than zero, suggesting that there is no strong congestion in the sample.

Our results indicate that the average output-oriented efficiency of these 24 EU railways is 1.353, based
on BCC model, suggesting that the overall EU railways should expand their outputs by 35.3 percent to
achieve efficient. Of the 24 railways, 10 have been evaluated as technically efficient with no input or output
slacks. The remaining 14 railways are inefficient, which should increase their passenger and freight transport
services, keeping current inputs usage, especially for FS (Italy), OSE (Greece) and LG (Lithuania).
Our results show that the scale elasticities are all greater than zero, implying that there is no strong
congestion for the 24 EU railways. However, the results indicate that 14 EU railways exhibit weak congestion,
of which eight belong to Eastern Europe and six belong to Western. Our empirical results also reveal that 12
EU railways present weak congestion in available capacity of freight transport, amounted to 166,549 tons,
which is the most congestive among four input factors; followed by the number of locomotives, amounted to
161 locomotives. It suggests that reduction in freight cars and locomotives is the important issue for these 12
railways. Moreover, 7 and 4 railways exhibit weak congestion in the number of seats and the number of
employees amounted to 4,850 seats and 527 employees, respectively. Based on these findings, the input
urgently required being contracted in most EU railways is the available capacity of freight transport
(tonnages), not the number of employees suggested by some previous studies which did not take the input
congestion into consideration while measuring the efficiency.
Privatization is perhaps the most effective means in treating the excessive inputs of transport industries.
The governments were aware of the disadvantages of public-owned entities, thus some EU railways have
undergone a very favorable reformation. For example, the separation of ownership and operational
management between the infrastructure and the transport services was initiated in Sweden in 1988. Banverket
(BV), a new company, became responsible for the maintenance of track network, while SJ (Swedish Railways)
was responsible for transport services. In 2001, the transport services were further divided into two parts: the
Green Cargo is a logistics company transporting goods, while SJ operates passenger transport business.
Likewise, other European countries such as Denmark, Netherlands, and Norway also underwent the similar
reformation for their rail transport. We conclude that those railways with input congestion should learn from
the benchmarked companies to eliminate the input congestion and further to enhance the productive
efficiency.
Different operation scale (in terms of the length of line), rail technologies (electrified versus diesel),
ownerships (public versus private), and socio-economic environment (e.g., population density and gross
income per capita) may be associated with different levels of input slacks or congestion. Therefore, one
promising avenue for future study is to investigate the effects of these internal and external factors on the
input slacks or congestion. In addition, examination of rail transport efficiencies and input congestion over
multiple years also deserve further exploration.

Measuring Firm’s Input Congestion with Consideration of Environmental Factors: Case
of Railway Transport5
Erwin T. J. Lin6
Abstract
In practice, the “input congestion effects”do exhibit in the railway transport due to the difficulties of
disposing unnecessary input factors. This study measures the output-oriented technical efficiency and input
congestion with consideration of categorical variables for railway transport by using DEA extension
approach. The empirical results from some selected 24 EU railways show that 13 railways are evaluated as
presence of weak congestion. Based on the results of identifying the source(s) of input congestion and further
determining its amount, one can obtain more insight to railways’ operationand thus propose more effective
strategies for improvement.

1. Introduction
Rail transport has long played an important role in the economic development for a country and thus
enhancement of its operating efficiency is important to be sustainable in a competitive context. Many
researchers have endeavored to rail transport performance measurement in the past several decades but one of
common drawback is that they did not take the input congestion effects into consideration. In practice, the
“input congestion effects”do exhibit in the railway transport due to the difficulties of disposing unnecessary
input factors (e.g. overstaffing). Thus, it would be helpful if one could identify the possible sources of input
congestion so as to propose more specific improvement strategies for any specific railway company. As such,
evaluating input congestion effects for rail transport deserves in-depth investigation.
In this study, we attempt to evaluate the output-oriented technical efficiency and then investigate the strong
and weak congestion for some selected European Union (EU) member states’24 rail companies in 2008. It is
hypothesized that there may exist strong and/or weak input congestions in some railways and the main
objective of this study is to test this hypothesis.
Moreover, based on previous literature, we note that some methods for measuring the input congestion have
been developed; however, these methods do not take into account environmental factors. In practice due to the
operating environment in different countries are somewhat heterogeneous, it is more reasonable to investigate
technical efficiency as well as input congestion by dividing the samples into several categories based on the
operation environment each company faced. This study thus investigates strong and weak congestions by
dividing the samples into two groups: Eastern Europe and Western Europe. More specifically, the
methodology for measuring input congestion in this study is a novel approach, which is modified by imposing
a categorical constraint on data envelopment analysis (DEA) models used in three stages approach. At

in Chinese textiles and automobiles industries. The results showed that elimination of managerial
inefficiencies could have led to output augmentation without reducing employment, and even in the heavily
congested textile industry, these output augmentations could have been accompanied by reductions in the
amounts of capital used. Viton (1997) applied DEA approach proposed by Färe et al. (1985) and used US data
to investigate the input congestion for bus transit; the results indicated no sign of excess usage of inputs.
Odeck (2006) also applied Färe et al. (1985) method to evaluate the operators’efficiency in Norwegian bus
industry; the results indicated that 92 percent of inefficiency is due to a formidable degree of congestion. Tone
and Sahoo (2004) developed a new scheme to evaluate scale elasticity in the presence of input congestion and
then applied their innovative method to a data set obtained from the Japan Chain Store Association. Their
results indicated that the Association had been operating under decreasing returns to scale (DRS) for the last
ten years. The findings are useful for managers to reform their business.
Based on previous literature, we note that at least three methods for measuring the input congestion have been
developed: Färe-Grosskopf-Lovell (FGL) method by Färe et al. (1985), Cooper-Thompson-Thrall (CTT)
method by Cooper et al. (1996), and Tone-Sahoo (TS) method by Tone and Sahoo (2004). These three
methods differ most fundamentally--FGL method used a radial Farrell (1957) measure, while CTT and TS
methods used a slack-based measure to identify the input(s) responsible for congestion. The key difference
between CTT and TS methods lie in the point of view--CTT method measures congestion in terms of
excessive input(s) while TS method in terms of output shortfall. In addition, TS method measures scale
elasticity before identifying congestion while CTT method does not. By definition, input congestion occurs
whenever increasing one or more inputs will decrease one or more outputs without improving other inputs or
outputs. In other words, it is meaningful and useful to identify presence of input congestion by checking
whether its scale elasticity is negative. In this sense, measuring congestion from output point of view and
calculating scale elasticity in advance seems more logical. We thus adopt TS method in this study, which will
be narrated in detail in the following section.
3. Methodology
3.1 Measuring Technical Efficiency and Slacks
The production technology can be represented by the production possibility set containing all feasible input
and output vectors: P = {(x,y)∣x can produce y}. That is, one can define the production possibility set as P =
{(x,y)∣(x≧Xλ, y≦Yλ, λ≧0) T }, where x = (x1, x2,…, xm) mR , and y = (y1, y2,…, yk) kR . P is closed,
bounded, convex, and satisfies strong disposability. Once the production possibility set is defined, the
efficiency can be measured by the distance from the observed data point to the best feasible practice (frontier),
which can be solved by the linear programming (LP) technique.
Assume that there are J decision making units (DMUs), J = {1,…, J}, each produces K outputs, K= {1,…, K},
by utilizing M inputs, M = {1,…, M}. Charnes et al. (1978) proposed to measure the technical efficiency for
DMUi under estimated by using the mathematical program which is known as CCR model in an
output-oriented form. The CCR model implicitly assumes that all DMUs are operated at its optimal scale, that
is, under the assumption of constant returns to scale (CRS). However, it is believed that this may not be the
case in practice. To relax this assumption, Banker et al. (1984) proposed the following model, which is known
as BCC model, to account for variable returns to scale (VRS).
36
Where, z is the binary variable, in which 1 stands for DMU with more favorable environment. The constraint
explicitly restricts the comparison set to exclude DMUs that face a more favorable environment in measuring
efficiency for those DMU with unfavorable environment. After i has being measured, one uses the model
(4) to compute the input and output slacks.

Again, the notations in (4) are same as in (3). Once , s+ and s- have been computed, four conditions can be
used to identify congestion: (1) if 1*  , 0* s and 0* s , then the DMU is efficient and not congested. (2)
if 1*  , 0* s and 0* s , then the DMU is technically inefficient, but not congested because there is no
output shortfall. (3) if 1*  and 0* s , or (4) if 1*  , then the DMU exhibits congestion. In this study,
we will use these four conditions to identify the existence of input congestion. For more detail, see TS (2004).

3.4 Measuring Weak Congestion
Since the strong congestion defined in the previous subsection is too restricted, TS (2004) thus relax the
restriction to deal with the weak congestion, which is defined as “weak congestion occurs whenever an
increase (decrease) in one or more inputs will lead to a decrease (increase) in one or more outputs.”Notice
that strong congestion implies weak congestion but not vice versa. To measure weak congestion, we calculate

kt and

mt by a two-stage method; that is, solve the following eq. (11) and then eq. (12).

In eq. (12), kt is the optimal solution of eq. (11). It should be noted that the major difference between
our proposed models (11), (12) and TS models is that we impose the last constraint on the models which
restrict the reference set only to those DMUs with the same and unfavorable environment. Once kt and

mt
have been calculated, we have the following two cases: (1) if 0*kt , no weak congestion is detected since a
decrease in inputs cannot increase any output. (2) if 0* kt and 0*mt , then DMU is identified as with weak
congestion.
4. Empirical Study
4.1 The Data
Our data set is drawn from International Railway Statistics, published by the International Union of Railways
(UIC, 2008). Note that when applying DEA to evaluate the performance, the DMUs under consideration
should be homogeneous (Golany and Roll, 1989). In this study we attempt to analyze the efficiency and
identify possible source(s) of input congestion of railways, we thus selected 24 railways in the member
countries of European Union. All of these railways provide both passenger and freight services. Those
railways providing only passenger or freight transport service, such as SJ (Sweden), NS (Netherlands), DSB

model, which is more efficient than those counterpart of without imposition. As for the output slack measures,
nine railways (ÖBB, SNCB, VR, CP, BLS, CFF, HZ, CD and MÁV Rt) are evaluated as with slacks in freight
service output, meanwhile six railways (SNCF, DB AG, FS SpA, RENFE, PKP and SZ) are measured as with
slacks in passenger service output based on the assumption of BCC model. On the other hand, eight railways
have slacks in freight, and four railways are evaluated as with slacks of passenger service when classifying the
sample into two categories. As we mentioned earlier, the operating environment will be more homogeneous
after dividing the samples into two groups based on their operating environment, thus the result seems more
reasonable and reliable. It is worthy to note that such relative larger scale railways as SNCF (France), DB AG
(Germany), FS (Italy), RENFE (Spain) are evaluated as exhibited output slacks in terms of passenger and/or
freight services no matter what model is used. This is one of the evidences indicating that larger railways
should downsizing so as to eliminate slacks.

To investigate the scale elasticity in production for each railway, we then measure the upper bound and lower
bound of ρby means of model (4) and equation (5), and the results indicate that all railways are evaluated as
with positive scale elasticity, indicating that there is no strong congestion in the sampling railways. As for the
weak congestion, by definition, the weak congestion can be detected as existence in those DMUs
with 1or)0and,1( ***    S . As can be seen from Table 2, thirteen railways, ÖBB (Austria), SNCB
(Belgium), VR (Finland), SNCF (France), DB (Germany), FS (Italy), CP (Portugal), RENFE (Spain), BLS
42
investigate whether the selected 24 railways have weak congestion by eqs. (11) and (12) and the results are
indicated in Table 4. Moreover, the results of DSE calculated by eq. (11) are also presented. From Table 4, we
note that 13 railways have negative DSE, indicating that they exhibit weak congestion. As for the output
shortfall ( t ), 9 railways can improve freight service by expanding 1,871 thousand ton-kilometers per
kilometer of line and 6 railways can improve passenger service by expanding 1,040 thousand
passenger-kilometers per kilometer of line, on average, so as to eliminate the weak congestion. As for the
excess inputs, based on our results, available capacity of freight transport service in terms of number of freight
cars is the most urgent input factor to be contracted, followed by available passenger cars per. This finding is
somewhat different from that concluded in the previous studies, which suggested that overstaffing is the most
serious problem.
At disaggregate level, from Table 4 we also found that some railways are evaluated as presence of input
congestion since decreasing in one of input will lead to increasing in one or two outputs. The policy
implication is that these railways should contract input accordingly so as improving their operating
performance, especially for those larger scale railways with larger amount of output shortfall such as SNCF
(France) and DB (Germany).

4adopting Tone and Sahoo (2004, TS for short, hereinafter) method. It should be noted that all of models used
in three stages have been modified by adding a categorical constraint into the models. Our results indicate that
measuring input congestion with consideration of dummy variable which is used to classify the sample into
two categories seems more reasonable and reliable than those just ignore environmental effects. The major
contribution of this study is that we identify the sources of input congestion in the railway transport
performance measurement by extending the DEA method and incorporating the environmental effects into
analysis, from which one can obtain more insight to railways’ operationand thus propose more effective
strategies for improvement.
The remaining parts of this article are organized as follows. The second section reviews some relative
previous studies and the third section describes the methodology adopted in this paper. The results of
empirical analysis for some selected railways are documented in section 4, and finally the conclusions are
presented in section 5.
2. Literature Review
The data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, first developed by Charnes et al. (1978), has been widely used
in performance evaluation for both public and private sectors. Many studies, including theoretical
developments and practical applications, have been published in literature in the past three decades. Since the
DEA method has some advantages (e.g., one can handle multi-output multi-input production technologies
without the need of specifying the functional form in prior), many researchers measure the technical
efficiency for railways by different DEA models. For example, Bookbinder and Qu (1993) estimated the
performance of two Canadian and five US Class I railways by using DEA. Oum and Yu (1994) applied DEA
to evaluate the eficiency of 19 OECD countries’ rail companies over the period of 1978 to 1989. Chapin and
Schmidt (1999) used the DEA to measure the efficiency of US Class I railroad companies since deregulation.
Cowie (1999) also applied the DEA to compare the efficiency of Swiss public and private railways by
constructing technical and managerial efficiency frontiers and then measured both efficiencies. Lan and Lin
(2005) further proposed a four-stage DEA model to evaluate rail transport efficiency, effectiveness,
productivity, and marketing capability. The aforementioned works have endeavored to measure the
performance of rail transport in the past; however, none have taken input congestion effect into account.
Conventional DEA models implicitly assume that each firm can always freely dispose overused input factors.
The treatment of congestion of input factors in the technical efficiency measurement context was probably
pioneered by Färe and Svensson (1980), who referred to Turgot’s “law of variable proportions”and
distinguished three different strengths of congestion of production factors, including output-limitational
congested, monotone output-limitational congested, and output-prohibitive congested. Färe et al. (1985)
subsequently proposed an operational input-oriented weak disposal DEA model for dealing with input
congestion measurement. Using a slack-based DEA approach proposed by (1996), Brockett et al. (1998)
estimated the inefficiency and amounts of input congestion in the Chinese empirical production before and
after the 1978 economy reforms. Their results indicated that textiles, chemicals and metallurgy industries all
exhibited input slacks due to the huge labor employment problem and all slacks of labor input in each industry
were attributed to congestion. Cooper et al. (2001) also adopted same approach to identify congestive inputs
in Chinese textiles and automobiles industries. The results showed that elimination of managerial
inefficiencies could have led to output augmentation without reducing employment, and even in the heavily

where x and y are input and output variables, respectively, λis weight, φi is the maximal proportional
expansion in all outputs, 1/φi is the efficiency of DMUi to be evaluated, s+ and s- are the output and input
slacks, respectively. Solving (1) for each of J firms, one obtains the efficiency score for each firm. To measure
s+ and s-, Ali and Seiford (1993) suggested employing a two-stage method: obtain φi by solving (1) and then
solve the following LP, keeping the objective function value at optimalφi.

Where the notations are same as in (1) and i is the optimal solution computed from (1). The
aforementioned models do not take into account environmental factors, in practice the environment each
DMU faced would never be the same. In other words, it is almost inevitably that the operating environments
of particular units will be non-homogeneous. For example, when measuring the relative efficiency for
Starbucks coffee shops, one could always argue the homogeneity due to the site of each coffee shop located is
different. It is unfair to compare the performance of unfavorable DMU to favorable one. To rectify, many
researchers thus proposed some modified models to account for the effects of environmental factors on
efficiency measurement. By referring some previous works, (for instance, among others, Banker and Morey,
1986a, 1986b, Ruggiero, 1996, 1998, Førsund, 2001) we propose to use the models as follow.

3.3 Measuring Strong Congestion
If a DMU is identified as congestive by using the conditions mentioned above, then we may need to further
find out the source(s) of congestion. First, by following TS (2004) we define strong congestion as“an increase
(decrease) in all inputs will lead to a decrease (increase) in all outputs.”Second, the efficiency under the
strong disposability assumption can be measured by the following LP:

Where qk+ is output shortfall. Note that the difference between eq. (8) and eq. (3) is that the inequality is
replaced by equality in the second constraint. To find out qk+, one has to use a two-stage method in the same
manner as in eq. (2).

The upper bound of scale elasticity can be calculated by w1 . Following TS (2004), in this paper we
define strong congestion as “a DMU is identified as strong congestion if and only if its upper bound of scale
elasticity is negative.”

(Denmark) and NSB (Norway) are excluded from our data set.
We choose passenger-kilometer per unit length of lines and ton-kilometer per unit length of lines as output
variables. As for the input variables, some studies selected number of employees, number of cars, and length
of lines as inputs. But we do not use length of lines because for rail transport industry, line-related facilities
such as tracks, signals, stations and yards can be viewed as sunk cost, which are generallyatributed to “fixed” 
costs. In this paper, we attempt to measure the efficiency of “variable” input factorsso as to identify the input
congestion. As for the input of rolling stock, because the passenger (freight) service cannot be produced by
freight (passenger) cars, therefore, instead of the sum of cars, we select available number of passenger cars
per unit length of lines, available number of freight cars per unit length of lines (both are in terms of cars/km)
as two input factors. In addition, we also choose the number of employees per kilometer of lines as the input
variables. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the data, including three inputs, two outputs, and one
scaling factor (length of lines).

Note: GNI is in the unit of million, and dollar, respectively, Pcars, Fcars are the number of cars used per kilometer of lines.
4.2 The categorical variable
From Table 1, one can easily find that the data are rather heterogeneous. Take Lines as an example, the data
ranges from 275 (CFL, Luxemburg) to 33,855 kilometers (DB, Germany). To make comparison sense, we
thus divide each output and input by length of line. In other words, we select the passenger-km per unit length
of line, and ton-km per kilometer of lines as two output variables, and choose number of employees per
kilometer, number of passenger cars per kilometer and number of freight cars per kilometer as three input
variables. Furthermore, table 1 also indicates that the environmental factor, GNI per capita vary from country
to country, the data ranges from 11,090 to 58,810 US dollars, and the standard deviation is 12,064 US dollars.
It reveals that the environments faced by different railways are quite varied. Based on the underlying theory of
transportation and some previous studies (see for example, Lan and Lin, 2005, 2006), we aware that GNI is
the factor which significantly affect transport service production. In addition, the average GNI of West Europe
and East Europe are 37334 and 18866 USD, respectively, suggesting that the operating environments between
these two regions are different. We thus introduce a category variable, z, into the models; in which 0 stands
for those railways belonged to East Europe and 1 for West Europe.
4.3 The efficiency and output slack measures
We measure output-oriented technical efficiency for the 24 sampling railways by applying the model (1) and
(3), the results are displayed in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, the average technical efficiencies of the
samples are 1.404 and 1.503, with and without classifying the samples into two categories. As expected, the
average efficiency of railways attributed to East Europe is 1.058 when imposing categorical variable on the
12
(Switzerland), CFF (Switzerland), CD (Czech), MÁV Rt (Hungary), PKP (Poland) are evaluated as presence
of input congestion as their efficiency scores are all greater than unity. Thus it is deserved to further
investigation.
In addition to BCC DEA model, we also measure the efficiency scores and output shortfall by using the model
(8), that is the technology based on the assumption of strong congestion and with categorical constraint. More
Specifically, we compute the efficiency and output shortfalls by using model (8), and then project the
inefficient DMUs to the frontier by the following the equation: unchanged.while,** xqyy o
p  Then,
recalculate the efficiency and the scale elasticity for each DMU after projection. The results are presented in
Table 3. As one can see from Table 3, as expected, the * are all less than or equal to those measured by
model (3), , and the average efficiency is 1.102, in contrast to 1.404 measured by BCC model. This is
because of that model (8) is more restrictive than model (3).

Similarly, we estimate the degree of scale economies for each railway under the assumption of strong
congestion technology by using model (8), and the results are documented in Table 3. By the definition, strong
congestion occurs if and only if 0 , as one can see from Table 3, there is no railway with negative scale
elasticity; suggesting that no strong congestion is detected under the assumption of strong technology.
As aforementioned, strong congestion implies weak congestion but not vice versa. Thus, we further
14
In the recent years, many researchers have paid their attention to investigation of scale elasticity for
production, most of them adopted BCC model as a useful tool. However, as TS (2004) pointed out that the
BCC model generally overstated true scale elasticity when congestion is present in production. To rectify, TS
(2004) have proposed a new scheme to investigate scale elasticity in the presence of congestion within a
unified framework. It is thus meaningful to apply the proposed new scheme to investigating the sources of
congestion for those industries with losses such as rail transport.
Since the production of railways, including passenger and freight service outputs are significantly influenced
by some environmental factors such as GNI per capita, which vary from country to country. To take into
account the environmental factor, in this paper we go one step further by measuring the efficiency and input
slack as well as input congestion with consideration of the category variable, which divide the sample into
two subsets, East and West Europe. Our empirical results indicate that of 24 observations, thirteen railways
are measured as inefficiency; none has been detected as strong congestion, while 13 railways are evaluated as
presence of weak input congestion.
The major contribution of this study is that we identify the sources of input congestion in the railway transport
performance measurement by extending the DEA method and incorporating the categorical variables into
analysis, from which one can obtain more insight to railways’ operationand thus propose more effective
strategies for improvement.
Different railway technologies (electrified versus diesel or steam traction power), and different ownerships
(public versus private) are frequently associated with different levels of input slacks as well as input
congestions. One of possible avenues in the future study is to investigate the effects of these internal factors
on input slacks and congestions and to apply the proposed model to the longer panel data for rail transport
efficiency evaluation.
