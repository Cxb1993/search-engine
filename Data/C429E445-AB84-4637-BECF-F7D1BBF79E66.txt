ABSTRACT 
 
A system of anion receptors based on boron alkyl compounds has been 
developed and studied as additives for lithium ion battery electrolytes. The anion 
receptor additives increase ionic conductivity and transfer number for lithium ion. The 
effects of boron alkyl-based as an additive in electrolyte for LiFePO4 batteries were 
investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclability, high temperature cyclability, 
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The surface analysis of SEI films 
was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) to distinguish various functional groups and surface morphology 
after high temperature cycling tests. The results showed the boron alkyl-based 
additives have the ability to improve the cycle performance of LiFePO4 cathode 
material at high temperature. Based on the results can help us to design and synthesis 
the best additives for lithium ion battery in the future.

第一章 緒論 
1-1 前言 
近年來綠色環保的議題備受各國重視，因而在 1991 年市場開始導入不會產生重金屬污染物之
鎳氫電池以及鋰離子電池等新型的二次電池產品，其特性比較見參考文獻[1]。在比較各種二次電
池之能量密度[2]、電池性能ヽ環境污染及成本高低等因素評估後，不難發現鋰離子電池所擁有的
潛力與優勢。2008 年日本富士經濟調查公司預估日本的鋰離子電池市場產值在 2013 年時將會比
2007 年增加 8 倍，而應用於電動車的鋰離子電池總數量也將成長 3.3 倍 [3]。然而在電動車使用之
電池安全性考量下，沒有過熱或爆炸等安全性顧慮的磷酸鋰鐵電池成為近來頗受矚目的焦點。磷酸
鋰鐵電池使用 Li4Ti5O12 負極材料搭配 LiFePO4 正極材料之電池，不但可大電流放電，更具快速充
電之特色，同時其循環壽命優且安全性高，非常適合各方面的動力應用[4]。目前國內許多的材料
製造商也相中這龐大的商機，積極朝電池材料上發展佈局，期望能降低磷酸鋰鐵材料的生產成本及
提高產量，再搭配電池產業的整合，相信未來磷酸鋰鐵電池不論是在動力供應系統或是電力儲存系
統方面的應用，將具有舉足輕重的關鍵。 
 
1-2 鋰離子電池工作原理介紹 
鋰離子電池的反應主要是利用鋰離子在兩電極的層間化合物間進行嵌入與嵌出的行為[5]進行
充放電。當充電時，電子由外部電源進入負極，鋰離子則離開正極，經由電解液進入負極；放電時，
電子和鋰離子的反應方向則相反，至於電池的充放電化學反應如參考文獻[5]所示。 
 
1-3 鋰離子電池材料之組成 
1-3-1 正極材料 
目前鋰離子電池所使用的正極材料主要可分為層狀結構之鋰鈷氧(LiCoO2)與鋰鎳氧(LiNiO2)、
尖晶石結構之鋰錳氧(LiMn2O4)、橄欖石結構之磷酸鋰鐵(LiFePO4)以及剪刀結構之五氧化二釩(V2O5)
等四種。有關其特性與應用比較詳見參考文獻[6] 。橄欖石結構之磷酸鋰鐵(LiFePO4)具有價格成本
低、元素蘊藏量豐富、材料結構穩定性高以及熱安定性佳等特性，使得 LiFePO4 非常具有潛力成為
電動車所使用的鋰離子電池正極材料。然而磷酸鋰鐵(LiFePO4)材料在充放電過程中會和電解液中
的 HF 產生化學反應，使鐵離子溶解出來並沉積於負極表面形成鈍化層，進而阻礙鋰離子於負極之
嵌入嵌出導致電容量衰退。此外，導電性較差也是其一大問題，目前改善方法包括有：(1)摻雜其
他金屬元素，(2)將 LiFePO4 尺寸奈米化，以增加其放電能力，(3)利用導電網路的架構降低阻抗[8]。 
近來有許多的研究報告指出，製備 LiFePO4/C 的複合材料具有較佳的結晶狀結構，由於當鋰離
子嵌入和脫嵌時，若 LiFePO4 和 FePO4 產生相變化時的結構性相似，將有助於降低鋰離子遷移時的
阻抗，而使 LiFePO4/C 複合材料的循環可逆性更為出色[9]。2002 年 X.-Q. Yang[10]等人研究結果顯
示，添加 0.1M TPFPB 於 LiPF6 系統之電解液中，在高溫（55℃）的環境中其電化學特性及循環壽
命皆有很好的表現。2010 年 Yong Min Lee [11]等人研究將 TPFPB、biphenyl （BP）以及 vinylene 
carbonate （VC）三者依不同配製比例探討其高放電速率的表現。結果顯示，含有 TPFPB 之電解
液，在循環壽命以及高放電速率皆有良好的表現，意味著 TPFPB 的存在有助於提升電池整體的電
性效能。 
 
1-3-2 電解液與隔離膜 
電解液是電池組成中一個重要的部分，主要的基本功能是用來作為正負極之間的傳導介質，扮
演著離子傳遞的角色，卻不與任一電極有反應。因此鋰離子電池之理想電解液條件詳見參考文獻
[12-14]。鋰離子電池中使用隔離膜的主要目的是用來隔開正、負兩電極，同時允許離子通過。目前
一般採用聚烯烴 ( poly-olefin ) 的多孔性材料，主要為 PP、PE 或 PP/PE/PP 兩者之混合物[15]。 
 
1-3-3 負極材料 
過去鋰離子電池以鋰金屬作為負極材料，但由於鋰金屬易與電解液反應，導致材料表面產生樹
枝狀的結晶而引發電池短路及爆炸[16]，所以目前商業化的負極材料選擇上還是以碳材為主。其選
擇條件可見參考文獻[17]。一般負極材料可分為傳統碳粉材料、高容量碳粉 [18]與非碳材 [19]。 
 
1-4 研究目的 
本研究探討在電解液中添加氟硼系的添加劑，以改善磷酸鋰鐵正極材料的高溫循環性能，以及
磷酸鋰鐵電極表面形成固液界面層 SEI(solid electrolyte interphase)膜對於鋰離子傳輸的效應影響。
利用循環伏安法、充放電測試、循環壽命測試與電化學阻抗圖等電化學方法，可得到添加劑對於磷
酸鋰鐵表面 SEI 膜之電化學特性，再配合掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM)、傅立葉轉換紅外線光譜分析
(FTIR)等材料表面分析結果，歸納此一類修飾物與 SEI 膜之特性影響。 
若能使磷酸鋰鐵材料結構在高溫的充放電循環過程中降低破壞，減緩電容量衰退快速的情況，
可提高電池的性能及安全性。如此一來，鋰離子電池應用於電動車的動力來源時，將可同時兼顧電
動車對於動力供應來源電池組的條件需求，以逐步取代現有使用石化燃料之引擎車輛，進而達到二
氧化碳零排放、無污染的綠色能源時代。

還原反應進行的情形[20,21]。實驗採用三電極式裝置進行測試。交流電阻抗分析(AC impedance)則
是觀察充放電結束後電池內部電阻電容變化情形，藉此了解添加劑之影響。 
        
第三章 結果與討論 
3-1 循環伏安法分析 
本研究使用的電解液為 1 mol‧dm-3 LiPF6 EC/DMC（1：1 w/w），添加不同濃度之硼烷基系的
添加劑，以三極式電池槽進行循環伏安測試。其中工作電極為磷酸鋰鐵，參考電極以及對照電極皆
為鋰金屬，以 0.1 mV/s 的掃瞄速率進行循環伏安測試，電位區間為 2.5～4.2V。 
Figure 3-1 是磷酸鋰鐵電極分別在不同濃度的電解液中，進行循環伏安掃描的第一圈曲線圖。
CV 曲線圖顯示在低濃渡電解液（0.025 mol．dm-3）中的磷酸鋰鐵電極之氧化反應起始電位約在 3.45 
V 左右，鋰離子由磷酸鋰鐵結構中脫嵌，鐵離子由 Fe2+氧化成 Fe3+，相對應的還原反應起始電位則
約在 3.41 V 左右，材料結構中的鐵離子由 Fe3+還原成 Fe2+ [9]。相對地在 0.05 mol．dm-3 電解液中
的 LiFePO4 電極之氧化反應起始電位約在 3.46 V，則還原反應的起始電位約在 3.40 V；值得注意的
是其氧化反應的起始電位較高則還原反應的起始電位較低，推測電解液中添加的硼烷基系化合物參
與反應形成 SEI 膜，可能造成鋰離子由材料結構中脫嵌通過 SEI 膜時的阻抗較大，以至於反應起始
電位有延遲的情況[22]，此現象尤其以添加 0.1 mol．dm-3 TPFPB 最為顯著；此外，其氧化反應的
面積比還原反應的面積大，推測是由於 SEI 膜形成時所消耗掉的不可逆電容量。 
Figure 3-2 為 CV 的第二圈曲線圖，從圖中可發現氧化還原波峰有良好的對稱性，表示有良好
的反應性和可逆性。另外，相較於第一圈，其氧化反應的面積明顯地縮小許多，而還原反應的面積
部份則與第一圈的還原反應面積相當，推測是由於電解液中添加硼烷基系化合物有助於電解液中
LiPF6 離子對的分離，進而提升電解液的導電性[23，24，25]。

3-2-2 循環壽命及放電速率測試分析 
將化成完成的 coin cell 分別於室溫及高溫( 60 )℃ 下進行循環壽命測試，藉以分析不同濃度的電
解液對磷酸鋰鐵電極在不同環境溫度下的影響。經由室溫循環測試後發現，使用不同電解液的 coin 
cell 放電電容量的衰退速率非常相似。此外，使用硼烷基系電解液的 coin cell 其放電電容量高於未
添加之電解液的 coin cell，推測可能是由於硼烷基系化合物添加於電解液中提高 LiPF6 離子對的分
離，進而提高導電性。然而，在高溫環境下進行的充放電循環測試結果則有相當顯著的差異。未添
加硼烷基系電解液之電容量衰退率非常快，然而使用硼烷基系電解液的 coin cell，電容量衰退率隨
著添加劑濃度的提升而有所改善；其中 TPFPB 添加於電解液中，隨著添加濃度的提升而有顯著的
改善，推測在高溫循環時，SEI 膜結構於初次的化成程序中形成且穩定性高，使鋰離子順利的遷移，
也保護電極的活性物質不會直接與電解液接觸，有助於避免材料結構受到破壞。

3-3 SEM 觀察分析 
利用掃瞄式電子顯微鏡觀察以瞭解不同電解液在不同的環境充放電後對生成 SEI 膜表面型態

現在 1150-900 cm-1 範圍中出現了數個吸收峰，推測在這波長範圍的吸收峰應為 P-O 鍵結的振動，
磷酸鋰鐵的特徵光譜區。此外，在 900-800 cm-1 區間出現的吸收鋒，這是由於 LiPF6 在電極表面發
生化學反應，形成的 P-F 鍵結的吸收峰，而 P-F 鍵結包含了 LixPFy或 LixPOyF。 
除此之外，在 1450-1300 cm-1 波長區間出現的吸收峰，為 CH2ヽCH3 彎曲振動的吸收峰，這是
由於電解液中的溶劑 EC 及 DMC 與鋰離子反應形成化合物；另外，在波長 1500 cm-1 附近的吸收波
峰在文獻中被定義為 Li2CO3[28]。在經過室溫循環測試後的紅外線光譜是非常相似的，然而使用硼
烷基系電解液的磷酸鋰鐵電極卻沒有出現 1800-1700 cm-1 和 1300-1250 cm-1 波長範圍的吸收峰。

a b s t r a c t
The effects of tris(pentaﬂuorophenyl) borane (TPFPB) additive in electrolyte at the LiFePO4 cathode on the
high temperature capacity fading were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
cyclic voltammetry (CV), cyclability, SEM and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). According to the study
results, tris(pentaﬂuorophenyl) boranehas the ability to improve the cycle performance of LiFePO4 at high
temperature. LiFePO4 electrodes cycled in the electrolyte without the TPFPB additive show a signiﬁcant
increase in charge transfer resistance by EIS analysis. SEM and FTIR disclose evidence of surfacemorphol-
ogy change and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation. FTIR investigation shows various functional
groups are found on the cathodematerial surface after high temperature cycling tests. The results showed
an obvious improvement of high temperature cycle performance for LiFePO4 cathodematerial due to the
TPFPB additive. The observed improved cycling performance and improved lithium ion transport are
attributed to decreased LiF content in the SEI ﬁlm.

1. Introduction
The battery is the heart of the mobile applications. It is now
popularly considered that LiFePO4 cathode material has the most
suitable characteristics for application as middle/large-size elec-
tric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) batteries in
terms of cost and stability. LiFePO4 with an olivine structure as
cathodematerial for lithium-ion secondarybatterieshasbeen stud-
ied extensively due to advantages such as low cost, good cycling
performance at room temperature, high safety, non-toxicity and
environmental friendliness. On the other hand, a major issue of
the LiFePO4 material is its low intrinsic electrical conductivity [1].
Moreover, olivine LiFePO4 exhibits such undesirable features as
capacity fading during cycling at elevated temperature due to the
olivine undergoing iron dissolution [2,3]. The dissolution of iron in
LiFePO4 material has been shown to be caused by the impurities of
LiFePO4 materials during the preparation process [4,5] as well as
the presence of HF and H2O in the cell [6].
Solid electrolyte interface (SEI) ﬁlms are formed on LiMO2 cath-
odes in LiPF6 carbonate solutions (M=V, Co, Mn, etc.) [7], with
strong effect on cathode performance [8]. LiPF6 itself always brings
with it HF contamination, which is detrimental to the performance
of both negative and positive electrodes [9]. For instance, HF reacts
with the LiMO2 cathode materials to form surface LiF, and some
of the cathode materials (e.g. LiNiO2) are nucleophilic and attack

the electrolytic alkyl carbonate molecules, thus forming –OCO2Li
surface groups and/or inducing polymeric species such as polycar-
bonates [10,11]. In general, both the solventmolecules and the PF6−
anions are reduced on the Li–graphite anodes to form surface ﬁlms
composed of ROCO2Li, ROLi, Li2CO3, species containing Li–C bonds,
polymeric species (e.g. polycarbonate, polyethylene), LiF, LixPFy,
and LixPOFy species [12]. It should be noted that the capacity fad-
ing found for both Li–C and LiMO2 electrodes in Li-ion batteries
is largely due to surface phenomena related to the above reactions.
Surface ﬁlm formationmay increase the electrode’s impedance and
pronounced surface-rated capacity fading of Li-ion electrodes can
be observed [13].
Some work has replaced the graphite carbon anode with a
Li4Ti5O12 anode, which operates at a potential above the reduc-
tion to iron metal. As a result, only the test cells with a graphite
anode experienced signiﬁcant capacity fading even though some
Fe dissolution was reported in both cases at 37 and 55 ◦C [3]. The
iron dissolution was connected to the presence of HF in the LiPF6.
The use of solutions containing lithium bisoxalatoborate (LiBOB)
and LiClO4 resulted in reduced capacity fading, although some fad-
ing was still observed [3,6,14]. High crystallinity LiFePO4 cathodes
prepared by hydrothermal synthesis exhibited no substantial iron
dissolution during cycling at elevated temperatureswhen the solu-
tion contained no acidic or protic contaminants [4,6].
Wu et al. [15] reported that addition of vinylene carbonate
(VC) in electrolyte solution greatly improved the high-temperature
(55 ◦C) cycling performance of LiFePO4-based Li-ion batteries,
reportedly because the VC additive signiﬁcantly reduced formation
of solid-electrolyte interface layers on both the LiFePO4 cathode

tra were recorded at room temperature using an attenuated total

128 scans. Surfacemorphology of the LiFePO4 electrodeswere eval-

3 s at each 0.02◦ step width over a 2 range from 20◦ to 60◦.
3. Results and discussion
The effects of the TPFPB additive on the electrochemical behav-
iors of the LiFePO4 electrode in the LiPF6-based electrolyte were
obtained by cyclic voltammetry. Typical ﬁrst and second consecu-
tive CVs of the LiFePO4 electrode in the 1.2mol dm−3 LiPF6 EC/DMC
electrolyte with and without 0.028moldm−3 TPFPB are shown in
Fig. 1(I) and (II), respectively. There is only one peak pair, consist-
ing of one anodic peak (charge) and one cathodic peak (discharge),
which corresponds to the two-phase charge/discharge reaction of
the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple. The fact that the ﬁrst and second anodic
peaks do not overlapmay relate to the improvement in the impreg-
nation of the solution into the composite (porous) electrode from
the ﬁrst to the second anodic polarization. The non-overlap may
also relate to fractures in the carbon coating that occur during the
ﬁrst delithiation of thematerial, which implies that electrode reac-
tivity is improvedduring the initial cycling. These results are ingood
agreementwithwhat has been reported [24]. The reproducibility of
the peaks in the CV plots conﬁrms the good reversibility of lithium
extraction/insertion reactions in the LiFePO4 electrodes. Examina-
tion of Fig. 1(II) shows that oxidation peaks at 3.61 and 3.67V and
reduction peaks at 3.23 and 3.18V of LiFePO4 electrodes are clearly
resolved in the electrolytewithout andwith 0.028moldm−3 TPFPB
additives, respectively. During the initial two cycles, the cathodic
peak of the LiFePO4 electrodes in the electrolyte with TPFPB addi-
tives has a shift to a higher voltage and the anodic peak has a shift
to a lower voltage, suggesting an increase in the redox potential
separation.We believe this peak shift is related to the participation
of TPFPB. More speciﬁcally, this result suggests that the addition of
the anion receptor (TPFPB) can affect the lithium ion transfer rate
and the interfacial properties of the passivation ﬁlms. It is demon-
strated that TPFPB is involved in the passivation reactions of the
LiFePO4 electrode during the initial charge process.

To further conﬁrm the effect of the TPFPB on improving
the cycling performance of the LiPF6-based electrolyte at ele-
vated temperatures, Li/LiFePO4 cells with the 1.2mol dm−3 LiPF6
EC/DMC electrolyte and the composite electrolyte containing
0.028moldm−3 TPFPB were cycled at 1C rate under constant
current conditions. Theexperimentswere runatboth roomtemper-
ature and 60 ◦C. Fig. 2 shows the capacity variation of the Li/LiFePO4
cells cycled at roomtemperature. The cellwith the composite LiPF6-
based electrolyte displays around 20% capacity loss at the 100th
cycle, which is identical to that obtained from the cell with the
1.2mol dm−3 LiPF6 EC/DMCelectrolyte. This indicates that thepres-
ence of TPFPB additive does not have any adverse effect at room
temperature on either electrochemical stability of the electrolyte or
compatibility with the LiFePO4 cathode. Fig. 3 compares the vari-
ation of capacity vs. cycle number obtained from Li/LiFePO4 cells
with the 1.2mol dm−3 LiPF6 EC/DMC electrolyte and the compos-
ite electrolyte with 0.028moldm−3 TPFPB when cycled at 60 ◦C.

reported by Herstedt et al. [18]. Herstedt further reported that,
with 0.2mol dm−3 TPFPB in 0.8mol dm−3 LiBF4 EC:DEC (2:1) elec-
trolyte, the SEI layer formed on the graphite anode consisted of: (i)
less LiF; (ii) more solvent reduction products; (iii) no Li2CO3. These
results show that 0.2mol dm−3 TPFPB is able to lower LiF formation.
The absence of Li2CO3 further suggests that the capture of F− ions
by TPFPB provides an environment which stabilizes lithium alkyl
carbonates [18]. However, excess TPFPB can facilitate the decom-
position of lithium salt (LiPF6) and generate PF5 [23], which is well
known to have negative consequences to both cathode and anode
materials.
AC impedance data for the Li/LiFePO4 cells with and without
anion receptor (TPFPB) after one cycle at room temperature, after
100 cycles at room temperature and after 100 cycles at 60 ◦C are
shown in Fig. 4(I)–(III), respectively. The AC impedance was mea-
sured after the cells were constant-current (0.1C) charged to 4.2V.
Clearly, the interfacial impedances of the cells were not changed
for the cells with/without TPFPB after the formation cycles at 25 ◦C.
However, the cell impedance after 100 cycles at room tempera-
ture in electrolyte with TPFPB additive was smaller than without
additive. The increase in cell impedance after 100 cycles at 60 ◦C
was signiﬁcantly greater than after 100 cycles at room tempera-
ture. Speciﬁcally, the SEI resistance at room temperature after 100
cycles was 18.84 without additive and 18.00 with TPFPB. In
contrast, the SEI resistance at 60 ◦C after 100 cycles was 143.4
without additive and 67.6 with TPFPB.We believe that the added
TPFPB participates in the formation of passivation ﬁlms, dissolves
LiF formedduringSEI formationon theLiFePO4 surfacewhencycled
at both room temperature and60 ◦C, and that TPFPB assists in trans-
portation of lithium ions through passivation ﬁlms on the LiFePO4
surface. As is well known that LiF is a nonconductor for both elec-
trons and lithium ions. Therefore, the dissolution of LiF from the
passivation ﬁlms can result in lower interfacial impedance. How-
ever, it seems that TPFPB has a dual role in the formation of the
passivation ﬁlm.
Surface analysis of the LiFePO4 electrodes was obtained after
the cycling test of the coin-type cells. Fig. 5 shows SEM micro-
graphs of a pristine LiFePO4 electrode and also of electrodes after
cycling in the electrolytewith/without TPFPB additive at room tem-
perature and at 60 ◦C as indicated. SEM imaging of the pristine
electrode clearly shows LiFePO4 particles with an average size of
a few m and also nano-size conductive carbon. The SEM micro-
graphs in Fig. 5(b) and (d) of the LiFePO4 electrodeswith electrolyte

without TPFPB additive have ﬂuff-like material on the electrode
surface. The ﬂuff-like material is seen to increase with increasing
cycling temperature. Theﬂuff-likematerial on the electrode surface
may be a kind of SEI which is produced from electrolyte decom-
position on LiFePO4 electrode surface, forming thick residue ﬁlms.
The morphologies of the LiFePO4 electrodes as seen in Fig. 5(c)
and (e) result from cycling at 60 ◦C in electrolyte with TPFPB
and appear similar to the morphology of the pristine electrode in
Fig. 5(a).
We then compared the electrode surfaces by FTIR spectroscopy,
using the diffuse reﬂectance mode. FTIR is a useful tool to probe
the local composition of the surface layer because the vibrations
of the molecular units of the LiFePO4 lattice are responsible for
absorption bands in the spectrum even when the material is dis-
ordered [26]. Fig. 6 displays the FTIR patterns of the LiFePO4
cathodes for the following conditions: pristine, after 100 cycles at
room temperature in LiPF6-based EC/DMC electrolyte, after 100
cycles at room temperature in LiPF6-based EC/DMC electrolyte
with 0.028moldm−3 TPFPB, being shown, respectively, as Fig. 6
curves (a)–(c). FTIR spectrum (Fig. 6 curve (a)) for olivine FePO4
exhibits a broad maximum between 900 and 1200 cm−1 which
can be assigned to P–O vibrations of the PO43− polyanion [27,28].
The absorption at 1137 cm−1 originates from symmetric and anti-
symmetric stretching vibrations of O–P–O. Because the difference
of the two vibrations is extremely small, there is only one peak
at 1137 cm−1 [27,29]. The absorption at 1034–1096 cm−1 originates
from symmetric stretching vibration of P–O [27,29]. The absorp-
tion at 939 cm−1 originates from P–O stretching vibration [27,29].
These data suggest that the post-run cell’s (FePO4) olivine is still
at the same position, but a little distortion has occurred due to
the interaction between LiFePO4 and electrolyte. The FTIR pat-
terns of Li2CO3 groups around 1500–1420 cm−1 agree well with
the results of Aurbach [7,30]. The spectrum shown in Fig. 6(b)
is for the electrode cycled without TFPFB at room temperature
and, unlike the other obtained spectra, contains peaks around
1500–1420 cm−1.
Whereas Fig. 6 showed the room-temperature FTIR curves, Fig. 7
displays the 60 ◦C FTIR curves, again for cathodes of the condi-
tions: pristine, after 100 cycles at 60 ◦C in LiPF6-based EC/DMC

diately under open-circuit voltage conditions. EIS was performed in
the coin cell by coupling the potentiostat with an Autolab frequency
response analyzer locked in an amplifier with an impedance phase
analyzer. A sinusoidal amplitude modulation of  10 mV was used
over a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. Surface morphol-
ogy of the LiFePO4 electrodes was evaluated by scanning electron
microscopy SEM, JEOL JSM35 operating at 20 kV.
Results and Discussion
The electrochemical effects of adding TPFPB to the LiPF6-based
electrolyte of a LiFePO4–Li cell are evaluated by CV. Cyclic volta-
mmograms for the LiFePO4 electrode in electrolytes without and
with 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB additive are shown in Fig. 1 as curves
a and b, respectively. Examination of Fig. 1 shows a pair of
oxidation and reduction peaks corresponding to lithium extraction/
insertion in the LiFePO4/FePO4 structure.16 The reproducibility of
the peaks in the CV plots confirms the good reversibility of the
lithium extraction/insertion reactions. Oxidation peaks at 3.62 and
3.68 V and reduction peaks at 3.25 and 3.19 V are clearly observed
in both the without and with 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB additive, re-
spectively. This reveals that the TPFPB additive affects the lithium
ion transfer rate and the interfacial properties of the passivation film.
The effects of TPFPB on the interfacial and stability properties
of the SEI films are considered further in terms of the cycling per-
formance of the LiFePO4–Li cell at a high temperature. The cycling
performance at 60°C of the LiFePO4–Li cells containing LiPF6
electrolyte with 0, 0.028, and 0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB additive are
shown in Fig. 2. LiFePO4–Li cell capacity fading after 100 cycles at
60°C decreased in the following order: without additive
 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB  0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB. More spe-
cifically, the LiFePO4–Li cell with 0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB additive
exhibited excellent capacity retention 84% after 100 cycles, i.e.,
16% capacity fading, whereas the cell using an electrolyte without
TPFPB showed severe capacity fading 78% after 100 cycles, i.e.,
22% capacity retention. Improvement in the LiFePO4–Li cell cy-
cling performance was observed for increasing amounts of TPFPB
additive in the electrolyte over the range tested. Curve c in Fig. 2
0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB, i.e., the higher level of additive of the two
levels tested herein is particularly promising. The excess TPFPB
can facilitate the decomposition of lithium salt LiPF6 and generate
highly reactive PF5, which is malign to both the positive and nega-
tive electrodes.14,15 The high capacity fading of the LiFePO4–Li cell
for the zero-additive case is related to the increased cell resistance,
which is a consequence of the high temperature cycling. Such high
temperature fading is commonly attributed to electrolyte decompo-
sition. In this case, LiPF6 breaks down, releasing the potent F− ion,
forming HF acid if water is present, contributing to undesired reac-
tions, such as corrosion of the cathode, changes in the SEI, and a
buildup of materials on the surface of the anode. Such behavior is a
well-known problem. Our results for a Li/LiFePO4 cell system in-
dicate a decreased battery life after high temperature cycling coin-
cides with increased resistance to the transfer of Li ions across the
SEI, increased resistance to charge transfer RCT across the SEI,
and increased total cell resistance.
To better characterize the mechanisms of capacity fading of the
LiFePO4–Li cells, impedance spectra for our various conditions
were recorded. Examination of the impedance spectra of the
LiFePO4–Li cells after one cycle at room temperature vs after 100
cycles at 60°C with/without TPFPB additives can help clarify the
ohmic and polarization resistance behavior coincident with capacity
loss. The Nyquist plots of the LiFePO4–Li cells at the charged state
4.2 V after the first cycle at room temperature and after 100 cycles
at 60°C are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The electrolytes in
all cases are 1.2 mol dm−3 LiPF6 EC/DMC 1:1 solution with
curve I without additive, curve II with 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB,
and curve III with 0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB. The impedance spectra
after the first cycle Fig. 3a show no significant differences for the
without/with additive conditions. The resistances of all the
LiFePO4–Li test cells increase significantly after 100 cycles at
60°C. The impedance of the LiFePO4–Li cell containing no TPFPB
electrolyte increases much more than that with TPFPB electrolyte.
The impedance improvement increases with increasing concentra-
tion of TPFPB.
Figure 4 shows an equivalent circuit model of the LiFePO4–Li
cell. In the circuit model, RS is the cell electrolyte resistance, while
RSEI and CSEI are the resistance and capacitance of the SEI film,
respectively. RCT and CDL are the charge-transfer resistance and the
double-layer capacitance, respectively. W is the Warburg resistance
related to the transfer resistance of the lithium ion across the SEI
interface between the active material and the electrolyte.17 Cell re-
sistance RCell = RS + RSEI + RCT values are fitted directly from
the SEI results of Fig. 3, with specific values provided in Tables I
and II. The LiFePO4–Li cell containing the electrolyte without ad-
ditive exhibits the highest resistance.
In Fig. 3, the RSEI values of the LiFePO4–Li cells containing
electrolytes with zero TPFPB, 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB, and
0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB increase from 5.70, 6.47 and 8.47  after
the first cycle to 143.4, 67.6, and 22.57  after 100 cycles at 60°C,
respectively. Clearly, the primary issue with increasing cell resis-
tance after high temperature cycling seems related to the resistance
of the surface/electrolyte interface. It is reported that adding TPFPB
to the electrolyte dissolves LiF from what would otherwise form a
passivation layer on the LiFePO4 surface.6 It is assumed that the
formation of a passivating LiF layer after one cycle at room tem-
perature is only slight so essentially no effect on cell performance

TPFPB. Here, the surface appears almost completely covered by a
fine-grain granular material that appears similar in size to the nano-
carbon grains. This material seems to exhibit a greater grain-to-grain
cohesion than the nanocarbon. Moreover, this material virtually bur-
ies the large-grain texture of the pristine electrode, effectively seal-
ing the electrode surface from direct contact with the electrolyte.
Figure 5c and d 0.028 and 0.1 M TPFPB, respectively shows the
LiFePO4 electrode morphologies after 100 cycles at 60°C with
TPFPB additive. The two images with TPFPB additive appear simi-
lar to the morphology of the pristine electrode, both showing the
large smooth LiFePO4 particles seen in the pristine electrode. Some
of the fine-grain cohesive material covering most of Fig. 5b is also
seen in Fig. 5c and d, but at a much lower concentration. We tested
the composition of this fine-grain material and found it is produced
from electrolytic decomposition consisting mostly of LiF, Li2CO3,
and polymer R–CO–O–R–CO–O–R.18 It is an interesting question
as to whether there are Fe compounds in this material because such
material could only be related to electrode decomposition. It is re-
ported that there is a strong correlation between the rate of iron
dissolution and the performance of iron-based electrodes in terms of
capacity, fading, and impedance. It is also reported that LiFePO4
electrode stability depends strongly on the presence of acidic spe-
cies, which are unavoidable for LiPF6-based electrolytes contami-
nated by trace water. Importantly, earlier work has found that for
electrolytes with no acidic contaminants, there is negligible iron
dissolution even at 60°C and that addition of TPFPB prevents acidic
contamination.16,19
The cycling performance of our LiFePO4 electrodes at 60°C in
LiPF6-based electrolyte without TPFPB showed severe fading, pre-
sumably caused by the high reactivity of LiFePO4 with electrolytes
containing a certain degree of water contamination to form HF at
elevated temperatures. This possibly contributed to electrode degra-
dation, although we did not observe this over the rather short ex-
perimental time period. Certainly, in the without-TPFPB case, we
observed quick formation of a surface-obscuring layer on the elec-
trode. This presumably LiF film appeared to increase the resistance
to Li ion migration and increase the kinetic energy required to trans-
fer electrons to the electrode surface.18 It is concluded that the anion
receptor TPFPB as an additive to LiPF6-based electrolyte is an ef-
fective method to reduce F ions in the solution and to reduce LiF
film deposition in the LiFePO4 electrode.
From a previous work, it was found that TPFPB, when added to
graphite/LiMn2O4 cells with 1 mol dm−3 LiPF6 in EC/DMC 1:1
volume ratio, was effective in improving power and life cycle at
elevated temperatures.15 Our present study confirms TPFPB to be
effective in Li/LiFePO4 systems for reducing resistance-inducing
residue formation and for enhancing cycling performance at el-
evated temperatures. Notably, the earlier work on the
graphite/LiMn2O4 cell indicates that 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB pro-
duced better cycling than the higher 0.1 mol dm−3 concentration.15
That study therefore cautioned against excessive levels of TPFPB.
In contrast to their observations, our work clearly finds
0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB gives better performance than
0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB in our Li/LiFePO4 cell. We tentatively as-
sume that this difference is related to our use of a Li metal anode as
opposed to their use of a lithiated graphite anode because TPFPB
has been reported to reduce efficiency of lithiated graphite elec-
trodes.
Conclusion
TPFPB is an effective additive to electrolyte for improving the
high temperature performance of LiFePO4 cells. A LiFePO4–Li cell
with a LiPF6-based electrolyte containing 0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB ad-
ditive exhibits much higher capacity retention and cycling perfor-
mance at 60°C than the same cell but without the additive tested
under the same conditions. The LiFePO4 electrode in 1.2 mol dm−3
LiPF6 EC/DMC electrolyte no TPFPB after 100 cycles at 60°C is
found to form a fine-grain material on the electrode surface, causing
the capacity fading in the LiFePO4–Li cell. The presence of TPFPB
in the electrolyte strongly reduces the buildup of the fine-grain ma-
terial on the electrode and reduces the resistance of the SEI film in
the LiFePO4–Li cell. It is concluded that TPFPB is a promising
electrolyte additive for improved cycling performance at high tem-
peratures for LiFePO4 cells. Whereas earlier work on a
graphite/LiMn2O4 cell found 0.028 mol dm−3 TPFPB produced
better cycling than the higher 0.1 mol dm−3 concentration, our
work clearly finds 0.1 mol dm−3 TPFPB to give a better perfor-
mance. It is assumed that this is related to our use of a Li anode,
because TPFPB has been reported to reduce the efficiency of lithi-
ated graphite electrodes. A high enough level of TPFPB in
Li/LiFePO4 presumably starts to decrease in efficiency, but that
level has yet to be determined. Our plans for future work include
testing higher levels of TPFPB and also investigating the composi-
tion of film that builds up on the electrode surface to identify the
products of electrolyte decomposition.

第 34 屆  應用陶瓷與複合材料會議 
The 34th International Conference and Exposition 
on Advanced Ceramics and Composites 
出 席 報 告 
 
臺南大學 環境與能源學系 張家欽 教授 
1、參加會議經過 
「應用陶瓷與複合材料會議」(Advanced Ceramics and Composites) 為美國
陶瓷及複合材料業界之研討會，美國為全世界應用陶瓷與複合材料的生產與研發
大國，且在應用陶瓷與複合材料的研發及生產的技術皆為全世界領先，在材料相
關學術界與產業界有相當重要的領導地位，此次為第 34 屆會議，地點在佛羅里
達州 Daytona Beach 的 Hilton Hotel 時間自 2010 年 1 月 24 日至 1 月 29 日止，
期間各項事務由美國陶瓷學會主辦。很榮幸受到大會邀請演講，講題為 “High 
temperature cycling performance of LiFePO4 cathode enhanced by 
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane additive”，此主題為本計畫 NSC 98-2221-E-024-007
之重要研究成果。 
我在 2010 年 1 月 22 日搭乘 23：40 的中華航空班機，當日下午 19：05 抵
達LOS ANGELES國際機場，再於 22：55轉機在 1月 23日 06：09底達ATLANTA，
再於 09：55 轉機在 11：27 底達 DAYTONA BEACH 機場隨後搭乘計程車到
DAYTONA BEACH 的 Super 8 飯店休息並準備將報告的資料。於 1 月 24 日上
午12：00 離開飯店，前往第49屆應用陶瓷與複合材料會議的會場Hilton Hotel 報
到註冊並領取會議資料，經過會議資料閱讀過後，發現此次會議之規劃分成 11
項主題，場次由 S1-S11 及 FS1-FS4 會場以主題分為陶瓷與複合材料機械行為；
應用陶瓷塗裝在於結構、環境與功能性應用；固態燃料電池：材料、科學與技術；
軍用陶瓷；未來生物陶瓷；陶瓷應用於電能發電、儲存、及分佈；4th International 
 3
關主題。值得一提的是，這一次會議中發表論文的不僅僅是學術單位而已，還有
一大部分是公司企業的研發單位，並且新能源與再生能源之固態燃料電池開發上
此次會議有美國民間與政府組織共襄盛舉，而且都相當精彩，這一點實值得臺灣
學習。報告人之主力研究對象為鋰離子電池的界面行為研發，界面電化學行為包
括電極材料特性及電解液特性，所以我對於陰極、陽極、及電解液三方面在美國
之研發情況均需有一定程度的瞭解，能作分領域規劃後再作心得分享是最佳的方
式。因此研究對象一直從電極材料、電解質導電性能、穩定性之測試搭配太陽能
電池或風力發電等電力系統之探討，內容包羅萬象，值得國人注意。 
 
三、建  議 
台灣在科技方面之研究發展應成立如美國之應用陶瓷與複合材料會議做策
略行性之規劃，將一些相關領域之小型研討會議整合成一大型國際會，如此可避
免小型研討會議資源不足宣傳困難，與會人員亦可多角度關心其他研究領域之發
展，而將國家之科技發展帶真正重點發展方向。
