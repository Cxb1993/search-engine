 Abstract	
This study of polymer nanocomposites was focused on the discussion of 
feasibility that PLA based plastics could be a potential candidate on the eco-friendly 
material of electronic devices, even engineering plastics, which can be used on 
automobile or furniture. This experimental research have been set on the discussion of 
crystallinity, mechanical and thermal properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) 
toughened PLA/ montmorillonite (MMT) nanocomposites, and the goal of this 
research is to improve their applicability and sustainability to reach the requirements 
of application on commercial products without much sacrifice in their 
biodegradability. The tensile test and flexural test showed that PLA blending with 
TPU in 10 wt %, talc in 4 wt%, and OMC in 2 wt% owes the highest modulus and 
strength without much sacrifice for elongation while the result form impact test show 
that the specimen of similar formula without OMC displays the highest impact 
resistance of 33.07 J/m. The hardness test showed similar tendency with the results of 
elastic modulus. The heat distortion temperature (HDT) tests showed that the 
specimens without annealing would not much alter their HDT even adding inorganic 
fillers while the specimens with thermal treatment would dramatically raise the HDT, 
which may come from the increase of crystallinity after thermal treatment. The 
observation under electron microscope demonstrated that the incorporation of 
inorganic fillers would lead to a homogeneous morphology from the initial 
heterogeneous morphology of PLA/TPU blends. On the other hand, the incorporation 
of glass fiber in these nanocomposites showed the significant enhancement of 
mechanical strength with no interference on their thermal behaviors. In the conclusion, 
this research provides a possible route to prepare biodegradable engineering plastics 
in traditional method.

 Chapter 1 Introduction 
Now a day, as the rise of concern about the environmental issue impacted the 
world, some serious problems have been suspected of bringing vital consequence to 
our life, such as global warming, the shortage of fossil resource and the accumulation 
of indecomposable waste. Since the prevalent used commodity polymeric materials 
are produced from non-renewable fossil resource, the accumulation and incineration 
of petrochemical-based polymer when being discarded after use have contributed to 
soil pollution and rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide. According to the estimate from 
United States Environmental Protection Agency, almost 25% municipal landfill space 
has been occupied by plastic products as indecomposable waste, and this situation is 
even more severe in Western Europe and Japan since their public space are more 
deficient than Northern America. [1] Thus, the research of environmental-friendly 
polymeric materials, which would decompose naturally into their original monomers 
without producing any noxious end-product, has been extensively conducted. Some 
possible eco-friendly alternatives from agricultural sources or microbial fermentative 
products have been utilized to replace the currently commercial polymeric products 
for short-life usage. [2] 
In the field of green chemistry and concern of environmental issue, Polylactic 
acid or polylactide (PLA) shows significant advantages over other 
petrochemical-based polymers due to its renewability, recyclability, reusability and 
decomposability. The life-cycle assessment (LCA) to NatureWorksTM PLA production 
by Cargill Dow LCC revealed that the required fossil energy from PLA production 
system was less than that from producing petrochemical-based plastics by 25-55%, 
which would much reduce the emission of atmospheric green house gas. [3] On the

 Chapter 2 Literature Review 
2.1 Biodegradable Polymers 
Degradable plastic is technical term that describes a plastic designed to undergo 
a significant variation in its chemical structure under specific environmental 
conditions, which have been defined by the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO). [4] Further, the 
other two terminologies frequently brought in this research field to describe the 
features of degradable plastics are biodegradable plastic and compostable plastic. The 
former means a degradable plastic in which the degradation results from the action of 
natural microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae; the later describes a 
degradable plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during 
composting to yield carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass 
without visible, distinguishable or toxic residue. [5]  
Biodegradable polymers, derived from both chemical synthesis and biochemical 
sources, have been a worldwide research effort for agriculture application and as a 
waste management option for polymers in the environment. These novel polymeric 
materials are designed to degrade upon disposal by the action of living organisms. 
Compared with conventional aliphatic plastics, biodegradable polymers disposed in 
bioactive environments would degrade by the enzymatic action of microorganisms, 
such as bacteria, fungi, and algae. Their polymer chains may also be broken down by 
non-enzymatic process, such as chemical hydrolysis, thermal degradation, 
photo-degradation and radio-degradation. During the process of biodegradation, these 
polymers would be converted into carbon dioxide, methane, moisture, biomass, and 
 5 
 
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), etc., though they are produced in much lower 
quantities than commodity plastics, they are still widely used in the variety of 
applications, including synthetic fibers, constructions, and transportations. Both of the 
above polymeric materials are mostly synthesized from petroleum-based source, 
consumed and discarded into the environment, accumulated as indecomposable 
wastes. Nowadays, over 150 million tons of plastics are produced all over the world 
every year, as a consequence, which results in the increase of oil consumption and 
plastic waste accumulation. [6] Worst of the all, several thousand and hundred tons of 
plastic are discarded and accumulated into marine environment every year, which 
ended as the oceanic pollution.  
On these backgrounds, two approaches had been suggested to prevent the 
environment from covering of these wastes: the construction of landfill sites, and the 
incineration of plastic wastes. As the fast development of society and rapid extension 
of human activity, the so-called landfill crises in many parts of developed world have 
attracted much criticism of manufacturing and using plastics because of their 
accumulation and indecomposability. Since satisfactory landfill sites are limited, 
burial of plastics in landfill is a time bomb. On the other hand, amounts of carbon 
dioxide produced during the incineration of plastic waste are suspected of sharpening 
the impact of global warming. Recently, as the problems on fossil resources and 
global environmental issue gained more attention, recycling of polymeric materials 
has become increasingly popular all over the world. Though the concept of material 
recycling have been developed extensively and put into effect, the problem of plastic 
pollution could not merely be soloved by means of plastic recycling since it is 
impossible to recover and recycle all of the used plastics. In addition, the recycling 
process of wasted plastics consume considerable amount of energy, which would 
 7 
 
sometimes remain non-degrade because of the lack of sunlight in landfills or 
underground. [9] 
 Semi-biodegradable polymers are the starch-linked polymers where starch is 
added to hold the short fragments of PE together. Once the starch-linked polymers 
have been discarded into landfills or underground, bacteria in the soil would attack the 
additive starch, which release the polymer fragments that could be degradation by 
other bacteria or be decomposed through hydrolytic degradation. In this case, 
bacterial indeed attack the starch but remain the non-degradable PE fragments.  
 Completely biodegradable polymers are those intrinsic biodegradable polymers, 
which consist of polymeric backbone or functional groups that would be digested by 
microorganisms. Several intrinsic biodegradable polymers have been discovered and 
separated from the nature, or synthesized in laboratory. Some of these polymers have 
been manufactured in industry and applied into agricultural and biomedical categories 
because of its actual utilization to form biodegradable polymers, including PLA, 
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polysaccharides, polyester 
amide, and the derivatives, copolymers or blends of the above. [10] 
 In the past decades, a large number of biodegradable polymers have been 
chemical synthesized or biochemical synthesized during the growth cycles of 
microorganisms or plants. Furthermore, several microbes or enzymes those are able to 
degrade them have been identified and separated. [11] Depending on their resources 
and synthetic routes, the biodegradable polymers would be classified into three 
different categories, i.e., polymers from biomass, polymers obtained from microbial 
production, polymers synthesized from biochemical or petrochemical monomers, 
listed into Table 2.1.1. [12] Natural polymers from biomass are mostly the derivatives 
from polysaccharide, such as starch, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan, which own good

addition, the similiar standards for evaluation of biodegradabilty under various 
conditions are regulated in ISO 13641, ISO 14855, ISO 15985, and ISO 17556. In 
another specific environment, ASTM D7081 is intended to provide the guidelines to 
establish the requirements for biodegradability in marine waters and sediments. [24] 
The standard testing methods of ultimate biodegradability under controlled conditions 
are listed in Table 2.1.2. Above these methods, the most commom testing method for 
biodegradability is ISO 14855 since it is designed to be an optimized simulation of an 
intensive aerobic process under controlled aerobic conditions. The degree of 
biodegradation is estimated for the carbon dioxide produced from the test materials. 
[25]

2.2 Polylactic Acid 
PLA, a biobased and biodegradable thermoplastic polyester, has been receiving 
much more attention in recent years than before because its monomer can be 
seperated from renewable plant-based sources, such corn, starch, sugar, and so forth. 
PLA is a sort of degradable plastics that behaves like PE, PET, and polyolefins in 
many ways, which leads to the broad range of applications. Figure 2.2.1 shows a 
closed life cycle of PLA. Due to its easy processibility and comparability with current 
processing machines, it can be formed into various products, such as transparent films, 
fibers, thin sheets and blocks via blow bolding, melt-spun, inject molding, extrusion, 
and even electrospin. Since it has found numerous applications in the medical and 
pharmaceutical fields and has been promising candidates with the potential to replace 
conventional petrochemical based plastics, some programs have begun to 
manufacturer large scale PLA. The devepolement of PLA into commodity plastics has 
been researched and designed from inception to the present commercial utility. In 
spite of the combination of several advantages and the unique characteristics, the 
commercial availability has been restricted by the high price and high production cost. 
Thus, the initial research and application focused on the high value products, like 
biomedicals and pharmaceuticals. Until the early 1990s, the instant demand on plastic 
marketing for more biofriendly plastic have stimulated the study and develop for high 
yield process of PLA; as a result, several methods were developed for the continuous 
production of both PLA and lactide. [6]  
In 1988, the project to develop PLA was launched by Cargill Inc., which was to 
establish a valuable opprotunity for strach processed by the company. This major step 
in the commercialization of PLA occured when Cargill Inc. developed its method to 
 15 
 
2.2.1 Synthesis and Manufacture of Polylactic Acid 
The basic unit of PLA, lactic acid, is the simplest 2-hydroxypropionic acid (α
-hydroxy acid) with a chiral center and exists two optically active enantiometric forms, 
as shown in Figure 2.2.2, which can be produced by fermentation of saccharides or 
chemical synthesis. The chemical synthesis route can produce large quantities of 
racemic lactic acid with low economic potential; thus, the fermentation of saccharides 
is the most common way to commercial manufacture of PLA. Due to the proportion 
of the enantiomer, the physical and chemical properties of PLA are flexible to meet 
the various requirements of manufacture and application in different purpose.  
 
 
Figure 2.2.2 Two enantiometric forms of lactic acid: L-(+)- and D-(-)- lactic acid. [29] 
 
 The main fraction of PLA derived from renewable sources is composed of 
L-isomer since the L-isomer predominates the majority of lactic acid from biological 
sources; as a result, the commercial available PLA are the homopolymer of 
poly(L-lactic acid) or copolymer of poly(D,L-lactic acid). [30] Before two decades, 
several technique have supplied to the production of PLA, including direct 
polycondensation, azeotropic dehydration condensation, and ring open polymerization, 
as shown in Figure 2.2.3. All of these above three methods can be used to produce 
high molecular weight PLA about 100 kDa.

system pressure for several hours at 130 ℃. This route maintains PLA with high 
molecular weight after a relative long period of polymerization yielding PLA with 
molecular weight as high as hundreds of thousand Da which owns enough mechanical 
strength to be processed into products. However, the solvent used in this process is 
hardly to remove completely from PLA, which restricted the application of end 
product and brought undesired environmental problems. 
 Ring open polymerization is the most preferred and feasible route for preparing 
high molecular weight PLA because the possibility of an accurate control of impurity 
provides PLA with different molecular weight and versatile properties in controllable 
manners. [32, 33] This route is a multi step process through the lactide intermediate, 
as shown in Figure 2.2.4. Firstly, the process occurs with the removal of water under 
mild condition to produce low molecular weight prepolymer which can be further 
depolymerized into a cyclic intermediate dimer, lactide. The additional catalyst, like 
antimony trioxide, antimony trifluoride, and stannic chloride, are required in this 
reaction. The distillated pure lactide is catalytically polymized via metal complexes, 
such as alumina, zinc, tin, and lanthanides, into high molecular weight PLA through 
ring open polymerization in a solvent free condition. [34-36] The molecular weight of 
PLA can be manipulated via the concentration of catalyst, impurities, reaction time 
and temperature. This route combines the environmental and economic benefits 
because of solvent free process reducing the potential cost of solvent disposal. Since 
Cargill Dow LLC developed this process in 1995 for the first time, most of the current 
industrialized PLA have been synthesized through this route. [37, 38] 
 
 
 
 19 
 
2.2.2 Properties of Polylactic Acid 
The physical properties of PLA, such as transparency, crystallinity, melting 
temperature, strength, hardness and other thermal or mechanical properties are highly 
dependent on the optical purity, thermal history, molecular weight of their constituted 
compositions, and so on. [39] Typically, PLA is a glossy, relative rigid, and 
semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer with comparable mechanical properties and 
thermal properties to PS or PET, as shown in Figure 2.2.5 and Table 2.2.1. 
Semi-crystalline PLA is generally characterized by excellent mechanical properties, 
with flexural modulus as high as 4-5 GPa, flexural strength tensile over 100 MPa, 
tensile modulus of approximately 3-4 GPa, tensile strength of about 60-80 MPa, and 
inferior elongation of 2-7 %, as shown in Table 2.2.2. Therefore, it seems to be the 
promising candidate to replace conventional plastic in many regions. However, the 
low elongation at break of PLA restricted its application in end use. Otherwise, the 
proportion of stereochemical composition deeply affect the growth rate of crystalline 
PLA and lead to a distribution of glass transition temperature between 50 ℃ and 70 
℃, melting temperature between 160℃ and 180℃, and crystallinity around 35% 
after annealing. Moreover, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, and 
crystallinity decrease with the increase in D-isomer content, as shown in Table 2.2.3. 
[40] Thus, the sort of the stereochemistry and molecular weight in PLA are chose 
according to the processing methods and application in end use.

molecular weight distribution, tacticity, terminal groups, degree of branch, and degree 
of crosslinking. And the factors associated with the higher order structure are 
including crystallinity, crystalline thickness, crystalline structure, spherulitic size, 
orientation, morphology, and hybridization. [45]

 Biodegradation are divided into three groups, including environmental 
degradation, microbial degradation, and enzymatic degradation. Environmental 
degradation is evaluated based on the overall degradation weather chemical or 
biological by measuring the loss of weight, change of tensile strength, decrease of 
molecular weight, oxygen demanded, or emission of gases under different 
environmental conditions, such as soils or seawater. Figure 2.2.6 shows a typical 
curve of PLA biodegradation in compost at 60℃. However, these methods of 
evaluation are controlled by several factors, like the type of microorganisms in

2.3 Polyurethane 
Thermoplastic polyurethanes are linear polymers in which the major structure is 
composed of aromatic or aliphatic segments connected by polar urethane bonding, as 
the R1 and R2 groups shown in Figure 2.3.1. The R1 and R2 groups can be short 
sections consisted of alicyclic, aromatics, or aliphatic structures, and even longer 
components derived from polyesters, polyethers, or polycarbonates. Polyurethanes are 
synthesized from diisocyanate monomers, long chain segments with hydroxyl 
terminal groups, and di-functional or tri-functional chain extenders by condensation 
polymerization. The urethane bonding is generally considered as a combination of 
ester group and amide group though its original monomers are neither amine nor 
carboxylic acid. The formation of urethane bonding involved the reaction of 
isocyanate groups with amine or hydroxyl groups was firstly developed by Otto Bayer 
and his coworkers in 1947 at the laboratories of I.G. Farben in Germany, and have 
been used far and wide to furniture, automobiles, resins, and other commodities for 
almost eighty years up to now. [46] Generally speaking, the main chains of TPU 
contain not only urethane, carbonate, ester, and ether groups derived from polydiol 
but urea groups, biuret groups, allophanate groups, and carbodiimide groups, which 
depending on the methods adopted for polymerization, isocyanate index, moisture in 
monomers, and environmental conditions at the step of polymerization.

Because of the thermodynamic incompatibility of the soft and rigid segments, the 
formation of localized microscale phase separation occurs and leads to the several 
significant domain morphology. It is believed that the mechanical properties of the 
final TPU are dependent on the nature and the extent of this domain formation. [48] 
TPU have been used in wide fields of products and industrial applications due to the 
diversity of characteristics and performances depending on the types of diisocyanate, 
polydiol, and chain extenders. Generally, the structure of TPU can be divided into 
four categories with different purpose of application, containing solid polyurethane 
(elastomers), rigid forms (high density forms), semi-rigid forms (micro cellular forms), 
and flexible forms (low density forms). [49]

since the regular arrangement provides significant structural phase separation which 
facilitates the formation of physical crosslinking through the hydrogen bonding 
between rigid segments. [50, 51]

amorphous states, the crystallinity of soft segments, stress induced crystallinity, and 
rigidity under tensile deformation at low extension exhibit a tendency toward increase. 
[51, 54] 
 In addition to the factor of soft segments, the types of rigid segments have much 
influence over the elastomeric properties and thermal properties of polyurethanes. The 
rigid segments are composed of diisocyanates and chain extenders. In the polymer 
matrix of TPU, rigid segments act as the role of physical crosslinking site between 
polymer chains. [49] There were many efforts elucidate the relationship between the 
thermal physical properties and rigid segments. It was revealed that the glass 
transition temperature of TPU decreased with the increase in the chain length of rigid 
segments and their partition in polymer chains. However, the mechanical properties of 
TPU showed a contrary tendency. The tensile strength and modulus would increase 
with the extension of chain length while the elongation at break would decline 
progressively. [55] Besides, the rigid segments show considerable effect on the 
thermal stability. The aromatic based diisocyanates show better thermal stability but 
worse photo-stability than the aliphatic based diisocyanates. In long-term use, 
yellowing is a common problem in aromatic diisocyanates, such as methylene 
diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Thus, aliphatic 
diisocyanates, like isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate 
(HDI), are preferred choices for outdoor usage. [53, 56] 
 In general, polyester based polyurethanes exhibits better mechanical properties 
and more considerable hydro-degradability than polyether based polyurethane. But 
the latter own superior properties in flexibility and gas permeability. The aliphatic 
diisocyanates are more flexible than the aromatic diisocyanates while the latter own 
good thermal stability and tensile strength.

increase in compositing conditions. It was believed that the hydrophobic soft 
segments seem to resist the hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation of polyurethane. 
However, the experimental results indicated that the surface hydrophobicity is 
considered to be a positive factor on biodegradability under compositing conditions 
since the hydrophobicity would lead to good adhesion of bacteria. [58] On the other 
hand, the shorter chain extenders on branched polydiols show much higher resistance 
to fungi attack and enzymatic degradation. Besides the effect of chain extenders and 
polydiols, comparison of aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic diisocyanates, it has been 
indicated that polyurethanes made with linear diisocyanate are less degradable for 
fungi than that composed of alicyclic diisocyanates [57] while contrary results were 
observed under compositing condition. The polyurethane composed of aliphatic 
diisocyanates showed higher biodegradation rate than that composed of aromatic 
diisocyanates. [58]

2.4.1 Processing Methods of Polymer blends 
There are various methods to prepare polymer blends based on the intrinsic 
properties of materials and the requirements in application. In addition, the flexibility 
of manufacture and cost of processing are usually taken into consideration in industry. 
In practical manufacture, melting blending, solution blending, latex blending, and 
interpenetrating polymer networks are common methods to prepare well-dispersed 
blending systems. Moreover, the melting blending, also known as mechanical blends, 
have been widely used to preparing PLA blends in laboratories or industries. [63] 
 Melt blending are the most rapid and economic method to manufacture polymer 
blends by means of mixing plastics at melting state through mechanical stress. Several 
sort of processing machines have been used to plastic compounding for almost a 
century, including kneader, compounder, extruder, brabender, and internal mixer. The 
melting state and performance of final products are maintained through the 
manipulation of operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure and feed speed. 
Since the feedstock are maintained at high temperature and shear stress, the 
processing condition should be monitored with care to prevent further degradation or 
yellowing which might bring negative effect upon mechanical strength. [62] 
 Other methods to prepare polymer blends are non-mechanical blending. Solvents 
or reactive monomers are required to obtain well-dispersed polymer solution in these 
methods. Solution blending is commercial technique and which has been used to 
fabricate thin-layered film. The compatibility between polymers and solvents is the 
key factor in blending process, which would affect the dispersity of final products. 
Especially, poor solvent might lead to immiscible blending system and phase 
separation. However, the usage of solvents will bring further cost on solvent removal 
 37 
 
force between thermoplastic polymer chains, the typical interaction between 
thermoplastic polymer blends are much weaker secondary bonding forces, such as 
Van der Waals force, electrostatic interaction, or hydrogen bonding. To discuss the 
miscibility of polymer blends, it should be noticed that the definition of the technical 
terms on miscibility and compatibility are varied with territory. For thermodynamics, 
the former indicates the variation of Gibbs free energy between neat polymers and 
polymer blends. For practical application and engineering, the latter judged from the 
morphology of blends and extent of phase separation. According to the morphology of 
polymer blends, the compatibility of polymer blends is divided into miscible blends, 
partial miscible blends, and immiscible blends. [64] 
Compatible blends mean the homogeneous morphology in polymer matrix that 
completely mixed into one phase without phase separation. The entanglement in one 
component is almost the same as that between foreign components, which would lead 
to the thermal behavior with one glass transition temperature. Compatible blends are 
rare in practical case and mostly consisted of polymers own similar structure or polar 
side groups.  
 Partially compatible blends are more common than completely compatible 
blends. These blending systems are usually required from common solution of the 
components by casting or freeze-drying. The heterogeneous morphology of phase 
separation would be observed under microscope, but it would provide certain 
interaction on the boundary between different phase that the existence of 
entanglement between different polymers The characteristics from intrinsic polymer 
source are remained in blends. As a result, there are two glass transition temperatures 
observed on differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and they may shift with 
composition of blends.  
 39 
 
 
Figure 2.4.1 The possible diagram of Gibbs free energy for a binary system. [67] 
 
According to the thermodynamic theory, the completely miscible blends would 
be approach at constant temperature and pressure if two following criteria content. 
∆G୫୧୶ ൌ ∆H୫୧୶ െ T∆S୫୧୶ ൏ 0   (2.1) 
and 
ቀபమ∆ୋౣ౟౮பమம಑ ቁ୘,୔ ൐ 0   (2.2) 
where △Gmix is the Gibbs free energy of mixing, △Hmix is the enthalpy of mixing, 
△Smix is the entropy of mixing, and ψι is the volume fraction of componentι. In 
Figure 2.4.1, the curve A of polymer blends violates the first criterion and leads to 
immiscible blends while the curve B describes a completely miscible blends. A 
blending system described as curve C is partially miscible and a little single 
amorphous phase could be formed at the composition to the left or right of minima. 
[61] 
 41 
 
while the last part is the enthalpy of mixing. Because of the high degree of 
polymerization, N1 and N2, the entropy of mixing is relative small and negligible. 
Thus, the enthalpy of mixing dominates Gibbs free energy of polymer blends. Since 
mixing of polymers are endothermic reactions in most cases, it is rare for polymer 
blends that the components are completely mixable. [67] 
 In past years, the solubility parameter of Flory-Huggins theory has been deeply 
discussed on the thermodynamic complexities of polymer solutions and has earned a 
deserved reputation in academics. If the solubility parameters of desired blending 
systems are achievable in most cases, many thermodynamic parameters can be 
calculated and the behavior of interesting properties can be estimated. However, there 
are no easy ways to calculate the solubility parameters for the wide range of practical 
polymer blends currently. [68] 
2.4.4 Polylactide Blends	
Due to the biodegradability, compostablility, biocompatibility, recyclability, and 
reusability, PLA has gained much attention on biomedical materials, cosmetic 
additives and food containers in recent decades; however, some drawbacks limited its 
application in many categories. Although neat PLA exhibit well mechanical strength, 
it is a relatively brittle and rigid plastics compared with other conventional 
commodity plastics. The slow nucleation rate and low crystallinity bring about its lack 
of thermal resistance and restrict the usage to room temperature. The imperfection of 
molecular resulted the irregularity and rigid main chain restricted the molecular 
motion are two reasonable explanation for the slow crystallization rate and the low 
crystallinity. Although the crystallinity could be raised via controlling cooling rate and 
increasing mechanical stretching, these methods are not feasible for all PLA products. 
 43 
 
Polymer blends of PLA with biodegradable polymers were reasonable strategies 
to improve its performance without much compromising on biodegradability and 
compatibility. Due to the existence of ester group, PLA is expected to be partial 
compatible with other biodegradable polyesters or polyester-based copolymers that 
could be used to plasticize polymer chains, strengthen its mechanical property, and 
enhance its performance in end-use. [79, 80] These biodegradable polymers may 
come from chemical synthetic routes, including PCL, PBS, polyethylene glycol 
(PEG), and TPU. They could also come from nature sources or be synthesized in 
biochemical routes, such as starch, chitosan, and PHA. Several research reported that 
PLA/PCL blends exhibit immiscible to miscible morphology and well compatibility. 
[81-83] This can be explained by the fact that the blends were meta-stable below low 
critical solution temperature (LCST). [84] On the other hand, it was reported that PEG, 
as a plasticizer for PLA [85], would be used to improve not only the hydrophilicity of 
PLA but also its degradation rate [86]. These blends of PEG/PLA are partially 
miscible [87], and their miscibility is dependent upon both molecular weight of PEG 
and PEG content in PLA matrix. [88-90] Though PBS and PLA were suggested to be 
thermodynamic miscible[91], the miscibility varied in different investigations. [92, 93] 
In previous research, some compatibilizers were added in PBS/PLA blends to improve 
their compatibility and enhance their mechanical properties. [94, 95] 
According to previous research, due to the existence of soft segments, TPU was 
expected to be compatible with PLA because PLA was reported to be partially 
miscible with kinds of polyether [96] and polyester [97]. Thus, there could be some 
quantitative interactions between PLA molecular chains and the soft segments of TPU, 
which might have originated from the miscibility and the hydrogen bonding between 
urethane groups of TPU and ester group of PLA. [79] TPU is a suitable biodegradable

2.5 Montmorillonite and Polymer/clay Nanocomposite 
Nature clay is composed of layered silicate and alumina is widely found in 
volcanic ash. According to the type of unit crystal lamella and complementary ion, the 
nature clay are divided into three types, 1:1 type, 2:1 type, and 2:2 type. The 
commonly used organically modified clay (OMC) for the preparation of polymer/clay 
nanocomposites (PCN) are family of 2:1 type, including, saponite, vermiculite, mica, 
illite, glauconite, and montmorillonite. [102] The crystal structure of MMT is shown 
in Figure 2.5.1 The sheet structure of MMT consist of tetrahedral silicate layer and the 
octahedral alumina layer. A sandwich structure, i.e., an octahedral layer between two 
tetrahedral layers, is formed by sharing their oxygen atoms on the edge and form a 
clay sheet with thickness of 0.96 nm. [103] These layered structures are hold together 
by weak electrostatic force with complementary metal ions. 
 
 
Figure 2.5.1 Structure of 2:1 MMT. [104] 
 49 
 
The solvent intercalation is based on solution system where polymer or 
prepolymer are dissolved and mixed with OMC in solvent. Typically, the first step to 
prepare solvent intercalation is the dispersion of OMC in suitable solvent, such as 
toluene, dimethyl formaldehyde, chloroform, and water. Then, the polymer or 
prepolymer are mixed with OMC solution, and the polymer chains intercalate within 
the narrow interlayer of OMC. After the removal of solvent, the intercalated PCN are 
remained. Due to the usage of solvents, the removal of solvent would be the critical 
process to prepare OMC with high performance. 
The in-situ intercalation is a preferred method to prepare well-dispersed PCN 
compared with solvent intercalation. The OMC is dispersed within liquid monomer or 
monomer solution; thus, the polymerization occurs between the interlayer space. 
Since diffusion of monomer is much faster than that of polymer, this method can 
facilitate the formation of intercalated structure and improve the dispersity of OMC in 
PCN matrix. 
Melting intercalation is the most common methods in current industrial process. 
The viscous mixtures of polymer and OMC are compounding under shear stress and 
above the soften temperature of polymer. Due to the solvent free process and 
compatibility with industrial process, like extrusion and injection molding, there has 
been much research focused on development of PCN via melting intercalation. [28] 
2.5.2 Characterization of Polymer/clay Nanocomposites 
Depending on the dispersity of OMC and the degree of penetration of the 
polymer chain into the interlayer space of OMC, the morphology of OMC are ranged 
from intercalated structure to exfoliated structure. The above types of PCN are 
categorized via the their remained lattice and micro morphology of derived from XRD 
 51 
 
2.5.3 Polylactide /clay Nanocomposites 
Composites based on PLA and OMC have been reported to improve their 
mechanical properties, thermal properties, and flame retardency. [115] Due to the 
dimension of particle sizes, modified nanoparticles were expected to disperse in 
polymer matrix and form strong interfaces between nanoparticles and polymer matrix. 
The melting intercalation is the most favorable method, and almost adopted by 
previous research because it is based on conventional extrusion or injection molding 
that are solvent-free and eco-friendly.  
In previous research, several discussions based on the intercalated structures and 
dispersion between polymer matrix have been supposed that the morphology and 
dispersion of PLA nanocomposites would have much effect on their final 
performance. These experimental results can explain the fact that mechanical 
properties and gas barrier properties were improved by adding limited small amount 
of fillers in polymer matrix. When these additive clay contents are over the limitation, 
which depend on the type of clay and organic modifier, the mechanical and barrier 
properties would decrease because of the aggregation of OMC. [110, 118] The 
increase on tensile modulus of polymeric nanocomposites has been used to evaluate 
the improvement of mechanical properties. In most conventional PLA based 
nanocomposites, the tensile modulus almost increased linearly with the weight 
fraction of OMC, whereas the tensile strength and elongation would slightly reduce. 
At low concentration of OMC in nanocomposites systems, the formation of 
theoretically complete intercalation was approached that might explain the modulus 
increased much more sharply than that of high concentration of OMC. [119] The gas 
barrier properties were used to estimate the dispersion of OMC in PLA since the 
 53 
 
In recent years, a series of research on melting intercalation of PLA/layered 
silicate was conducted by Toyota Technological Institute, as shown in Table 2.5.1. It 
was shown that these types of state were depended on parameters, such as the aspect 
ratio of layered silicate, the nature of the organic modifier, and the OMC content.

3.3 Preparation of TPU-blend-PLA/MMT Nanocomposites 
 The experimental procedures for preparation of biodegradable engineering 
plastics in this research contain was divided into two major parts: the synthesis of 
biodegradable polyurethane, and the preparation of biodegradable polymeric 
nanocomposites. The commercially available plastic granules of PLA with weight 
average molecular weight of 100 kDa were purchased from Wei-Mon industry Co., 
Ltd. The biodegradable TPU used in this research was synthesized by two stage 
polymerization in acetone. And the organically modified MMT was supplied by Pai 
Kong Nano Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan. 
3.3.1 Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyurethane 
The TPU used in toughened PLA nanocomposites was synthesized from 
polyester based polydiol, aliphatic diisocyanate and chain extender. Hence, the 
properties of TPU were easily manipulated by changing the ratio of hard/soft 
segments and types of monomers. In order to soften the relatively rigid backbone of 
PLA and toughen their impact resistance, the TPU used in preparation of PLA/TPU 
blends should own soft rubber-like properties and well compatibility with PLA; 
besides, the existence of TPU should not affect the biodegradability of PLA. Thus, 
linear aliphatic diisocyanate and polydiol were used in this research, and the polydiol 
would dominate the backbone of polyurethane. 
The synthesis method of TPU adopted in this research was two stage 
polymerization in acetone, including the formation of prepolymer and chain extension. 
The adequate quantity of polyester based polydiol, polybutylene adipate with average 
molecular weight of 2000 Da, PBA 2000, was dried in vacuum at 70℃ for 12 hours. 
 61 
 
3.3.2 Preparation of Biodegradable Polymeric Nanocomposites 
The polymer blends and polymer nanocomposites were prepared by either melt 
blending or melting intercalation. The plastic granule of PLA was dried in oven at 70 
℃ for two hours while the plastic granule of TPU was dried at 90 ℃ for five 
minutes before mixing process. The dried granules of PLA and TPU were firstly 
mixed with the powder of talc, OMC, and glass fiber by physical shaking. A 
conventional twin-screw extruder which equipped with screws of L/D ratio near 25 
and composed of ten processing sections were used to compounding the initial 
mixtures and re-granulation. The blending quality of twin-screw extruder was 
dominated by two major processing parameters: temperature of each section and feed 
rate. In this research, the processing conditions for ten continuous zones of isolated 
heating extruder barrels were setting at 45, 160, 170, 180, 180, 175, 170, 165, 160, 
and 170 ℃ from feeding throat to metering sections and die, and the rotating rate of 
screw were set at 200 rpm. At the last step, the standard testing specimen were 
prepared by injection molding, which was composed of the blending plastic granule 
from extrusion. The metal mold used in injection molding was designed in accordance 
with the testing standard of ASTM. Generally, the molding quality of injection 
molding was dominated by recycle time and processing temperature. The fill time of 
resin was maintained at 9 seconds; the hold time of pressure was 6 seconds, and the 
cooling time of resin was 100 seconds. The operating temperature of injection 
molding machine were 150, 160, 155, and 150℃ from feed section to injection gate. 
The prepared specimens were cooling at room temperature. There were two types of 
injection molded specimen used in the mechanical properties testing including quickly 
quenched specimens and annealed specimens. The former ones were directly cooled

3.4.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra 
The characteristic absorption of infrared spectra comes from the motion of 
molecules, including rotation and vibration. Theoretically, each functional group has 
its own unique absorption peaks or bands that would be utilized to determine the 
practical structure of polymers and a real time information about the degree of 
reaction. In this research, the highly viscous preplymer or polymer acetone solution 
were spread as a thin polymer film on transparent calcium fluoride salt plates. The 
polymer film was dried out by thermal blower and then fixed on the sample holder. 
The infrared spectra scanned 16 times for each specimen was conducted in the range 
from 1000 to 4000 cm-1 with a resolution of 4 cm-1.  
3.4.2 Tensile Test 
The tensile strength, tensile modulus, and tensile elongation at break of each 
specimen were measured by tensile testing machine in accordance with ASTM D-638. 
The dumbbell shaped test specimens, made of injection molding, of ASTM D-638 
Type 1 were conditioned using standard conditioning procedures, and each sample of 
nanocomposites was carried out at least five molded specimens. The tensile testing 
was conducted at the rate of strain 50 mm/min in the standard laboratory atmosphere. 
3.4.3 Flexural Test 
The flexural strength and modulus of each specimen were evaluated according to 
ASTM D-790 under three-point bend. The injection molded test specimens were 
prepared in accordance with the recommendation of 127 by 12.7 by 3.2 mm tested 
flatwise on a support span of 48 mm, and each sample of nanocomposites was carried 
 67 
 
nanocomposites was calculated by considering the theoretical melting enthalpy of 
100% PLLA crystal as 93.6 J/g. [43] The thermal stability of nanocomposites were 
assessed with thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), carried out under nitrogen flow. 
All samples were preheated at 100℃ for ten minutes to ensure that there were no 
moisture remained. The heating rate was 10 /min from 100 to 700 .℃ ℃  
3.4.7 Heat Distortion Temperature 
The deflection temperature under flexural loading of nanocomposites was 
conducted according to the testing criterion of ASTM D-648. The injection molded 
test specimens were 127 mm in length, 13 mm in depth, by width of 3.0 mm, and each 
sample of nanocomposites was carried out at least two specimens. The maximum 
applied stress at the specimens was 0.455 MPa and the heating rate was maintained at 
2.0 /min.℃  
3.4.8 Morphology 
The morphology of each specimens were observed by field emission-scanning 
electron microscopy (FE-SEM), using a JSM-6700F machine (JOEL, Japan) at an 
accelerating voltage of 10 kV. All specimens were cryogenic fractured after 
immersion in liquid nitrogen for about 5 min. After dehydrated for one hour in 
vacuum oven, the fractured surfaces were sputter coated with an ultrathin film of 
platinum to provide enhanced conductivity through ion sputtering coater prior to SEM 
examination. The micrographs of SEM were recorded at a magnification from 500 x 
to 2000 x.

 Chapter 4 Results and Discussion 
4.1 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra 
Biodegradable thermoplastic polyurethane was synthesized by stepwise 
polymerization which was based on the reaction of polyester based polydiol, aliphatic 
diisocyanate, and chain extender in acetone solution. The schematic flow diagram was 
listed in Figure 3.3.1. As shown in Figure 4.1.1, several characteristic peaks of 
absorption had been indicated on the figure that could provide an evidence of the 
reaction for the formation of urethane bonding. The FTIR spectra of TPU synthesis 
showed the characteristic peaks at 3560, 3450, 2940, 2240, and 1730 cm-1. On the 
spectroscopy, the significant variations of characteristic peaks were isocyanate group 
at 2240 cm-1, secondary amine group at 3450 cm-1, and hydroxyl group at 3560 cm-1. 
As the formation of urethane bonding, the isocyanate group and hydroxyl group 
would fade away with the increase of the secondary amine group. The characteristic 
peaks at 2940 cm-1 as well as 1730 cm-1, attributed to the methanediyl group and 
carbonyl group, were remained constant since both of these groups existed in the 
original polyester and the final polyurethane. Thus, the relative integral intensity of 
absorption peaks could be used to identify the quantity of unreacted functional groups. 
The results from FTIR not only demonstrated a dynamic variation in the formation of 
TPU but also provided a useful real-time monitoring tool. For the first step of 
preparation of propolymer, the terminal point of reaction was determined from the 
remained quantity of isocyanate group and the disappearance of hydroxyl group. As 
for the second step of chain extension, the end point of chain growth was determined 
from the completed disappearance of isocyanate group.

4.2 Tensile Test 
The tensile properties including tensile strength, and elongation at break of neat 
PLA and their nanocomposites were measured at standard laboratory atmosphere. The 
detailed results were listed in Table 4.2.1 and Table 4.2.2. For all PLA 
nanocomposites, it was shown that the neat PLA owned the highest tensile strength 
compared to other specimens. The strength of nanocomposite would gradually 
decrease as the increase of inorganic fillers in polymer matrix while the adding of 
OMC showed no much influence on the elongation. The tendency toward decrease in 
tensile strength and elongation may imply that the transition of behavior from 
ductility to brittleness. It was reasonable that the incorporation of talc and OMC 
would lead brittleness since these inorganic fillers are relatively rigid to polymeric 
matrix. Thus, in order to derive ductile PLA nanocomposites, the neat PLA should 
toughened by adding plasticizers or blending with relatively soft polymers. 
The incorporation of TPU was expected to achieve the requirement of ductility 
and toughness in the application of engineering plastics. Comparing Table 4.2.1 and 
Table 4.2.2, it showed that the association between TPU and PLA had a marginal 
improvement on the elongation at break while this improvement was not obvious for 
those specimens with high content of additive OMC in polymeric matrix. The 
elongation of PLA/TPU blends rose more than double in contrast with that of neat 
PLA whereas it showed no much difference on the elongation between LAT4C14 and 
LUT4C14. This result illustrated that the improvement of ductility may merely exist 
in the case of low content of inorganic filler. As the inorganic fillers play the dominant 
part in composites systems, the toughened mechanical behavior would transit to 
brittleness from ductility. Thus, there is an optimum value of tensile strength in

elongation of the nanocomposites in PLA/TPU blending systems were reduced as the 
increase of the content of inorganic fillers. As shown in Table 4.3.2, it was indicated 
that the specimen of LUT4C02 still exhibited the highest flexural modulus and 
strength. Like the flexural properties of PLA and their nanocomposites in Table 4.3.1, 
the similar pattern of transition in mechanical behavior was also observed in Table 
4.3.2, and both of the injection molded and annealed specimens were reduced when 
the content of OMC was over than 2 % in polymer matrix. It was possible that the 
existence of inorganic fillers would act as the nucleus, facilitate the crystallization, 
and turn the TPU plasticized PLA matrix into a more rigid structure though the 
incorporation of TPU was significantly reduced the flexural modulus and raised the 
tensile elongation.  
Furthermore, the facilitation of recrystallization was observed from the results of 
DSC analysis. The high ratio of OMC in polymer matrix showed no improvement on 
the crystallinity and enhancement on mechanical behaviors since the intercalated 
structure exhibited the tendency to form the structure of flocculation because of the 
hydroxylated edge-edge interaction. In addition, the stacking layered structure would 
be formed at high content of OMC. Both of these cases might be observed at high 
ratio of OMC and reduced the dispersity of OMC. [105] Thus, the adding of OMC 
would turn a reinforced materials into that with relatively weak mechanical properties 
when the ratio of OMC in composite systems was over the upper limitation. It was 
possible that a crystalline structure with several grain boundaries formed at high OMC 
content because of the existence of nucleus. The weakness on grain boundary and 
poor interaction between polymer and inorganic fillers might lead to the brittleness of 
nanocomposites. However, the practical structure of nanocomposites should be 
analyzed with care and described from the observation of their surface morphology

nanocomposites did not achieve the expected performance eventually. After thermal 
treatment, the impact resistance of annealed PLA nanocomposites obviously 
decreased to near half of their initial values in most of these specimens but the impact 
test of annealed PLA/PU nanocomposites showed that the existence of limited content 
of OMC would enhance the impact resistance of PLA/PU blending systems. As 
shown in Table 4.4.1, the impact strength of LAT4C06 reduces from 13.87 J/m to 5.87 
J/m while that of the specimen in LUT4C06 rises to 17.6 J/m from 20.27 J/m.  
These results may come from the brittleness of crystalline structure as the 
elongation of break was significantly reduced in tensile test. In tensile test, the length 
of elongation before break bears most of the applied stress, which absorbs the energy 
by shape deformation. In other words, the behavior of impact resistance was 
correlated with the tensile properties. The specimens with poor elongation would be 
expected to inherit weak impact resistance. In addition, it was possible that the 
crystalline structure with several grain boundaries could lead to the brittleness of 
nanocomposites. Comparing with Table 4.2.1 and Table 4.2.2, most of the results from 
impact test showed similar tendency with that of tensile test. Nevertheless, there were 
still some specimens beyond prediction, such as the specimens of LUT4C0, 
LUT4C02, and LUT4C06. These results showed that there could be some correlation 
between inorganic fillers and TPU. The detailed mechanism should be discussed by 
further characterization. 
 
 81 
 
4.5 Hardness Test 
Shore D hardness of nanocomposites was tested in accordance with ASTM 
D-2240 Type D designed to measure the hardness of hard rubber or rigid 
thermoplastics. Typically, for polymeric materials, there is strong correlation between 
hardness and elastic modulus that is the relative stiffness of a material. As shown in 
Table 4.5.1, it was ranged from 74 D to 83 D for the hardness of PLA, PLA/PU 
blends, and their nanocomposites. The testing results revealed that the Shore D 
hardness of neat PLA and PLA with 4 wt% talc composites significantly increased 
from 76 D to 81 D while it gradually decreased as the adding of OMC. The hardest 
specimens in all of the system of PLA nanocomposites was LAT4C0. As for the 
PLA/PU nanocomposites, the similar pattern of hardness transition via different ratio 
of inorganic fillers was observed, and the specimen of LUT4C02 showed the highest 
value of Shore D comparing with other specimens. 
For annealed specimens, it was showed that the hardness of all specimens 
slightly increased for one or two degree of Shore D after thermal treatment. The result 
was coincident with the assumption of rising crystallinity via thermal treatment. As 
the part of crystalline predominate the major part in polymer matrix, the apparent 
physical behavior of polymer tend to rigidity. However, further investigation on 
crystalline and morphology should be required provide more evidence to confirm.

4.6 Thermal Properties 
The behavior of plastics is highly dependent on their thermal history that could 
be traced by the analysis of differential scanning calorimeter. The thermal history of 
plastics has a strong influence on their degree of crystalline, glass transition, melting, 
and crystallization temperature. In practice, most of the researchers would discuss the 
thermal behaviors of polymer according to the results from the second heating scan of 
the DSC curves. In order to compare the difference of thermal behaviors before and 
after annealing, both of the first heating scan and second reheating scan were 
illustrated and analyzed in this research. The crystallinity of neat PLA, PLA/PU 
blends, and their nanocomposites were calculated through normalization, which were 
obtained from dividing the practical fusion enthalpy of PLA by the theoretical values 
of the corresponding weight content of PLA. Since the small content of TPU was only 
play a minor role in calculating normalized values of fusion enthalpy of PLA, the 
fusion enthalpy of TPU was neglected. 
 The heating differential thermograms for neat PLA and PLA nanocomposites 
after injection molding are shown in Figure 4.6.1 and the same specimens after 
non-isothermal crystallization process are shown in Figure 4.6.2, and the important 
thermal parameters of transition at the heating process are listed in Table 4.6.1. As 
shown in Figure 4.6.1, the neat PLA exhibits typical thermal behaviors of 
semi-crystalline polymer where the glass transition, crystallization, and melting are 
observed on the heating process. Since the main chain of PLA is composed of rigid 
short-chain ester bonding, it has been believed that the rigid amorphous fraction 
dominate the major part in their polymer matrix, which lead to their intrinsic slow 
crystal growth rate and low crystallinity. Figure 4.6.1 shows that there were no much 
 85 
 
temperature endothermic peak when the OMC contents increased, which may imply 
the additive OMC could improve the lamellar rearrangement. The integral heat of 
fusion of both endothermic peaks barely changes with the adding of OMC; thus, the 
lamellar rearrangement would not much affect the amount of crystalline materials.  
In addition to the phenomenon of lamellar rearrangement, all of the specimens 
shows exothermic recrystallization near 100 ℃ while the exothermic peaks are 
decreased even vanished at the second reheating scan. Although the talc and OMC 
were expected to reduce the crystallization half time and accelerate the crystallization 
rate of PLA in injection molding process, the cooling crystallization time for the 
polymeric chain of PLA to arrange regularly was deficient in rapid cooling rate of 
injection molding. After a constant cooling rate of 10 ℃ /min, the exothermic 
recrystallization peaks for the specimens with the incorporation of inorganic filler 
became negligible except for that of neat PLA. These results clearly indicated that the 
inorganic fillers have a positive effect on the acceleration of crystallization of PLA; 
nevertheless, the cooling time appears to be an important factor on the crystallization. 
Thus, a post-annealing or slow cooling rate are required to obtain highly regular 
crystalline of PLA 
The heating differential thermograms for PLA/PU blends and their 
nanocomposites after injection molding are shown in Figure 4.6.3 and the same 
specimens after non-isothermal crystallization process are shown in Figure 4.6.4. 
Some thermal parameters of the PLA/PU blends and their nanocomposites at the 
heating process are listed in Table 4.6.2. It was shown that the existence of TPU in 
polymeric matrix would not much alter the thermal behavior of PLA. The only 
difference between the specimens of LA and LU was that the former one owns lower 
temperature of crystalline than the later, which might imply that the incorporation of

previous literature reviews that high ratio of inorganic inert particles such as OMC, 
mica, and talc could not promote sufficient ability of flame retardant alone but the 
presence of these kinds of inorganic fillers would reduce the thermal stability. To 
achieve the flame retardant requirement, the conventional flame retardant such as 
halogen and phosphorus are used to enhance the flame retardant ability. Also, there 
could be a possible synergistic effect occured between the inorganic fillers and flame 
retardants to enhance the formation of carbonaceous char residue. [127] 
Generally, the addition of OMC to the polymer would enhance the thermal 
stability by acting as a superior thermal insulator and mass transport barrier to volatile 
products that generated during decomposition, thereby suppressing combustion. Table 
4.6.3 lists some important parameters of PLA, PLA/PU blends, and their 
nanocomposites, including onset degradation temperature where 5 wt% of the sample 
was loss (T5%), the middle point of thermal degradation, and the weight fraction of 
residue that was nonvolatile at 700 ℃ (char residue). The TGA curves of these 
specimens are shown in Figure 4.6.9 and Figure 4.6.10. These results showed that the 
onset point of degradation would decrease as the increase of inorganic fillers. The 
onset point of neat PLA and PLA/PU blends were 370 and 367 ℃, respectively while 
that of specimens with 14 wt% OMC decreased to 299 and 305 ℃ as the gradually 
adding of OMC. Besides, addition of the talc talc, such as the specimen of LUT4C0, 
would lead to a decrease in onset temperature of degradation from 370 to 356 ℃. 
These results may imply that the adding of both OMC and talc may reduce their 
thermal stability.  
In previous research, it was indicated that the nonoxidative thermal 
decomposition ammonium cation that is used to the organic modifier in OMC 
generally proceeds by either a Hoffmann elimination reaction or an SN2 nucleophilic

nanocomposites showed uneven surface and random distribution of the fracture 
propagation.  
On the other hand, the observation on the surface of PLA and their 
nanocomposites showed a much different result from that of PLA/TPU 
nanocomposites. The SEM images of cryogenic fractured surface of PLA and their 
nanocomposites were shown in Figure 4.8.3 and Figure 4.8.4. As shown in Figure 
4.8.3 A, the growth of crack on neat PLA was randomly distributed on the fractured 
surface. It was shown that the surface was plane and smooth with no obvious cave, 
hill, or void volume on the cryogenic fractured surface. Furthermore, the image of 
Figure 4.8.4 A provided a detailed information about the microstructure of PLA in 
higher scale. The surface was so smooth that there were little crack can be observed 
on it, which was a typical behavior of brittle fracture. For those specimens with 
inorganic fillers, the fractured surface was much rough and filled with several void 
volumes and crack, which showed a marked difference from that of neat PLA. As 
shown in Figure 4.8.4, several string-like marks on the fractured surface of PLA 
nanocomposites were observed under the magnification of 2000 x. These void volume 
and string-like marks could explain why the impact strength and flexural strength 
increased after adding inorganic fillers in PLA. It was sure that both of the formation 
of string-like marks and cavitations would affect the impact strength and matrix 
deformation. In particular, the formation of extensive plastic deformation in PLA 
matrix could implied that the yielding deformation of PLA nanocomposites had taken 
place in applied stress.

 Chapter 5 Conclusion 
The overall purpose of this research was set out to design an adequate 
biodegradable engineering plastic based on PLA and assess the feasibility on practical 
application, including mechanical properties and thermal behaviors. PLA with 
aliphatic based polyurethane was chosen as the main matrix in this study. It was 
expected that the incorporation of TPU would enhance the mechanical strength of 
PLA and transfer the brittle failure into brittle failure at stress loading. In addition, 
organic modified OMC and talc were added as inorganic fillers to improve the 
thermal behaviors and crystallinity. A summary of these experimental conclusions was 
listed as the follows. 
 The mechanical testing results, including tensile test and flexural test, showed 
that the incorporation of TPU into PLA would decrease the modulus and strength 
while the elongation at break was increased. Since the chain of TPU was much softer 
than that of PLA, this result was correspondent with the expectation that the existence 
of TPU would toughen the PLA matrix. Furthermore, the adding of trace inorganic 
fillers would raise the modulus, strength, and hardness without much sacrifice in 
elongation at break. As for thermal treatment on the specimens, the results showed 
that the flexural behaviors of nanocomposites became much more brittle than that 
before annealing. It was possible that the tendency of brittleness may come from the 
increase of crystalline in polymer matrix since the annealing process would raise the 
crystallinity. 
The results from impact test showed that not only the incorporation of TPU but 
also the adding of talc would improve the toughness of PLA, which may come from 
the enhancement of mechanical strength. The results from tensile and flexural tests 
 111 
 
incorporation of OMC in polymer matrix would retard the escape of volatile 
decomposition products from the nanocomposites, which means that the mass 
transportation of volatile decomposition products was limited by the formation of char 
on the surface of polymers and these volatile organic compound was restricted in 
polymer matrix. The formation of char could act as a physical barrier between the 
polymer and the superficial zone where the combustion of the polymer occurred. 
The results from HDT test showed that the specimens of adding TPU owned 
lower HDT then that of neat PLA nanocomoposites since the glass transition 
temperature and melting point of TPU were much lower than those of neat PLA while 
the thermal treatment would significantly raise the HDT of PLA/TPU nanocomposites. 
In addition, the annealing process has a critical influence on HDT of PLA and their 
nanocomposites. Not only from the view of practical industrial application but also 
control on the dispersity of layered silicate sheets are the core issues that have been 
discussed, i.e., the increase of crystallinity is achieved through the interaction between 
PLA molecular chains, TPU molecular chains, and the inorganic fillers. In view of the 
similar melting points among these specimens, the increase of HDT could be 
powerful evidence that the crystallinity was much increased after annealing process. 
It can be concluded that the PLA/TPU nanocomposites are adequate to apply on 
several category. However, there are still some technical problems should be solved 
before practical application. For example, the annealing process is rare in practical 
injection molding manufacture, and the thermal treatment would add another cost on 
manufacture. Furthermore, the impact resistance of these nanocomposites is not 
comparable to current engineering plastics. Nevertheless, these nanocomposites are 
still a potential candidate to replace the current petroleum based plastics, which will 
bring us an environmental-friendly life in the future.
