• PART I − The Carrier Dynamic in the InGaN
Quantum Well
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, nitride based light-emitting diodes are
playing a dominant role in solid state lighting [1]–[5]. It
is known that at high power the device efficiency suffers
efficiency droop. The efficiency droop [?], [6]–[8] in In-
GaN/GaN quantum well LEDs has been investigated for a
while, but a clear reason for the droop problem has not yet
been provided [8]–[10]. It is interesting that in spite of a high
dislocation density (> 108 cm−2), the radiative efficiency is
not low, especially at low current injection with low indium
composition. The high performance of the blue or near UV
LED suggests that dislocations may not be of importance in the
LED performance. In most papers discussing the nonradiative
effects the non-radiative lifetime due to dislocation or defects
is assumed to be given by τnr = 100ns – 10ns for analyzing the
internal quantum efficiency(IQE). One may ask the question:
Is the non-radiative lifetime independent of indium composi-
tions? Once in the quantum well how do carriers reach the
dislocations and defects?
Dai et. al [5] have shown through their experiments that
nonradiative lifetime and IQE are strongly dependent on the
injection carrier density and dislocation spacing in certain
cases. Hence, it is important to make a more complete study
on the lateral transport of free carriers once they are in the
InGaN quantum wells. This transport occurring under very
low electric field is important as it determines how carriers
diffuse toward regions of dislocations or defects before they
recombine radiatively. In order to study this phenomenon, we
use the Monte Carlo approach [11]. The process allows us to
include interface roughness scattering [12], electron-electron
scattering [13], [14], phonon scattering [15], and charged
dislocation scattering [16], [17] while studying the lateral
mobility and diffusion length of carriers in the InGaN quantum
wells. We show that the lateral diffusion length strongly
depends on the interface roughness, indium composition, and
radiative lifetime. We will show that for the low indium
composition, the dislocation play a minimal role due to smaller
quantum confined Stark effect(QCSE). However, for the higher
indium composition, the dislocation density plays a dominant
role in limiting IQE. The influence of junction temperature,
quantum well width, defect trapping center size, and nonpolar
structures have also been studied.
II. METHOD
We examine the LED problem in two related steps. The
vertical transport in which carriers enter the quantum wells
and the lateral transport within the wells which allow the

carriers to sense the defects. The vertical transport involves
carrier injection, band bending and is examined through the
use of Poisson, Schrodinger, and drift-diffusion methods. To
determine the lateral carrier transport in the InGaN quantum
well LED, we apply the Monte Carlo method. Carriers in
the active region i.e. in the quantum well are quantized in
the vertical direction and the injection carrier density and
the quantum well shape is dependent on the applied bias.
We use the one dimensional(1D) Poisson, Schrodinger and
drift-diffusion equations solver [19] to calculate the carrier
quantum confined states, carrier density under bias, and the
relation of current density to carrier density. The spontaneous
recombination rates Rsp(h¯ω) [20] for carriers with different
energy is obtained from Fermi-golden rule where:

In our model the carriers diffuse laterally till they either
recombine radiatively or encounter a defect. In a real device
the defects are random in space and we simulate this by using
a Monte Carlo process to place dislocation defects randomly in
the quantum well with different average spacing (dependent on
the dislocation density) as shown in Fig. 1. In the simulation
process, the electron will diffuse randomly in the quantum
well for a calculated radiative lifetime. During the diffusion
process, if an electron enters within a cross section of the
location of the dislocation defect, it will be captured by the
dislocation defect and recombine non-radiatively. Otherwise,
it will diffuse till it recombines radiatively. In both of these
two conditions, the carriers lost are recorded for the statis-
tical output. Finally, the internal quantum efficiency can be
determined by

and Nnonrad is total counted number of non-radiative recom-
bination. Figure 1 also presents the definition of interface
roughness length l, width d, and conduction band disconti-
nuity potential, ∆Ec. The size of interface roughness and
potential fluctuation ∆Ec also influence the carrier mobility
significantly and limit the diffusion ability. The quantum well
widthW is assumed to be 3nm in most cases. Hence, if the d is
close to W , the structure has a very large interface roughness
and the material may be thought of having indium clustering.
III. RESULT
Figure 2(a) shows the calculated current versus average n2d
with different indium composition in the 6 pair multiple quan-
tum wells using our Poisson, drift-diffusion and Schrodinger
solver. The well width is 3nm. We find the carriers will spill
over the quantum well when the overall average n2d in each
quantum well is larger than 7−9×1012cm−2. Also, the Auger
effect might happen when the average n2d is at this range.
We find that the efficiency reaches the maximum when n2d is
near 8× 1012cm−2 since the influence of QCSE is reduced to
6the experimental results are around 108 cm−2, we find that δ =
2 nm provides the best fit. We note that the dislocation density
in the experimental results for different wavelength devices is
not the same and the fitted δ may not present the exact case
for the device. However, the value of δ is in a reasonable range
and should be able to explain the trend in the experiments.
D. The Influence of quantum well width and junction temper-
ature
To study the influence of quantum well width on the LED
performance, we assumed different well width (3 nm, 4 nm
and 5 nm) in the Poisson, Schro¨dinger and drift-diffusion
solver to obtain the carrier information and then calculated
the mobility and diffusion length. The simulation results are
shown in Fig. 7 (a). We fixed the carrier concentration n3d
equal to 1.3×1019cm−3 in each case and the dislocation
density is 108 cm−2. For the wider quantum width, the hole
wavefunctions and electron wavefunctions are separated more,
and the Rsp becomes smaller as the electron-hole overlap
decreases. Although the carrier screening makes the overlap
larger, band bending is still larger for wider quantum well and
the radiative lifetime is much longer. Therefore, the efficiency
becomes lower with larger quantum well width as shown
in Fig. 7 (a). It is to be noted that use of wider quantum
well widths to increase the total amount of carriers in the
quantum well is one way to reduce the carrier overflow and
the Auger recombination. However, this also alters the non-
radiative process and makes them more dominated.
Non-radiative recombination process will release energy
leading to the heating of the junction. Unless the IQE becomes
100%, the device will heat up due to the energy loss. Figures
7(b) shows the IQE versus temperature with different values of
the interface roughness. When the device is heated up to 400K,
the IQE drops around 30 to 40 % because of the increase of
τr. Therefore, the heating effect will make the non-radiative
process even more dominant and may lead to or worsen the
droop effect at higher current density. It may appear that
pulse measurement can completely remove the heating effect.
However, the local heating effect at the active layer may not be
avoided. In our previous studies we have studied the transient
heating in the GaN HFET devices [24] and found that the
heat up time of the device in the active layer is only a few
nanoseconds so that a very short pulse is needed.
E. Nonpolar Structures
To achieve a better IQE it has been suggested to reduce the
radiative lifetime by using the nonpolar [25], [26] or semipolar
[?], [27] structures. Therefore, to investigate the influence of
the nonpolar structure where there is no quantum-confined
Stark effect, we assumed the polarization charge difference
at the heterointerface are zero in our Poisson, Schro¨dinger
and drift-diffusion solver and calculated the radiative life-
time. We then use the Monte Carlo method to estimate the
radiative efficiency. Figure 8 (a) shows the estimated IQE
of nonpolar and c-plane InGaN quantum wells versus the
indium composition when the dislocation densities are 107
cm−2, 108 cm−2, and 109 cm−2. The red (solid) lines are
for nonpolar structure and the black (dashed) lines are for c-
plane structure. As we expected, the radiative lifetime becomes
much smaller due to the larger spontaneous emission rate
(Rsp). As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the efficiency decreases rapidly
with the indium composition in the c-plane structure due
to the QCSE, but IQE decreases only slightly with indium
composition in the nonpolar structure. The reason for the
slight decrease of the nonpolar case with higher indium is
due to the smaller effective mass and the larger mobility,
which leads to the decrease of IQE as the indium composition
increases. Therefore, the carrier diffuses much faster in the
higher indium composition in the non-polar case. However,
even with nonpolar structure, we still find the efficiency would
not be 100% if the dislocation density is high. It does improve
a lot in the long wave range compared to the c-plane one,
but low dislocation and defect density conditions are still
needed. Thus improvements in growth technology are needed
to suppress defects beyond the current values.
If we assume the dislocation density to be 3×108 cm−2, our
simulation results show a good agreement with the experimen-
tal results [18] in low indium compositions as shown in Fig.
8 (b). At higher indium composition, the experimental result
shows lower IQE than we expect from our simulations. We
think that this is due to the difficulty of growing high quality
samples at high In composition. If we want to fabricate yellow
or green LEDs with higher IQE, low dislocation density and
reduced QCSE by nonpolar growth are both necessary.
IV CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have analyzed lateral dynamics of free
carriers in the InGaN/GaN quantum wells using Monte Carlo
methods. This has allowed us to examine lateral mobility, dif-
fusion length and internal quantum efficiency. Our calculation
shows the diffusion length is much longer than the dislocation
spacing in current devices where typical dislocation density
values are about (108 cm−2). As the indium composition in
the well increases, the diffusion length increases. As a result,
carriers are trapped by dislocation defects and subsequently
recombine non-radiatively. The most important reason for
this unfavorable phenomenon is the long radiative lifetime
resulting from the strong QCSE. From the simulation results,
the IQE of 10% indium quantum well is about 60% but for
40% indium is only few percent if the dislocation density
is 108 cm−2. Since the IQE is not 100% in most cases,
it is necessary to include the thermal effect in the studies.
Our calculation also shows that the higher temperature leads
to the decrease of IQE due to longer radiative lifetime and
shorter non-radiative lifetime. Thus the heating effect will
further reduce the IQE and contribute to the droop effect. We
also have discussed how factors such as dislocation density,
trapping cross section diameter, quantum well width, and
use of nonpolar structures influence the internal quantum
efficiency. Our studies show that with the non-polar structure,
the IQE does improve significantly but it will still not reach
the 100% value if the dislocation density is high. Even with
a nonpolar structure, the dislocation density levels need to be
below 107cm−2 if the internal quantum efficiency is to reach
100%.

to the overlapping of the n- and p-electrode, the lighting region
is mostly under the opaque n-electrode and shaded by the n-
electrode even though it has better spreading effect than the
horizontal LED. As a result, the typical vertical LED structure
is not good for improving the performance of the LED even
with a TCL layer. Therefore, we try to separate the n- and p-
electrode to obtain higher light extraction. Here, we construct
a simple model as shown in Fig. 10(a) to examine the location
of the lighting region. As defined in Fig. 10(a), we separate
the n- and p-electrode apart from each other by a distance
D. As we know, the current prefer flowing through the lower
resistance path. Figure 10(b) and 10(c) show the electron (Jez)
and hole (Jhz) current distribution when the D is equal to 100
µm. We can find that the electron current is mainly flowing
through two ways, one is near the edge of the n-electrode, and
the other is beyond the p-electrode since these two ways have
comparably lower resistances for the others. The hole current
is mainly beyond the p-electrode and hardly diffuses toward
the n-electrode due to the low mobility of the p-GaN layer.
Therefore, we can clearly see that the lighting region is mainly
beyond the p-electrode and excludes the region below the n-
electrode as shown in Fig. 10(d) so that the light extraction
will increase as well.
In this kind of vertical LED with separated electrodes,
the hole current is severely crowded near the p-electrode. To
improve this problem, we need to figure out how to alter the
hole current spreading length. Hence, we simulate a series
of different hole mobilities of the p-GaN layer, including 10
cm2/V·, 50 cm2/V · s, 100 cm2/V · s, and 200 cm2/V · s,
respectively when D is equal to 100 µm. As shown in Fig.
10(e), we can divide the variation line into two regimes, the
region 1 is near the edge of the p-electrode, and the region 2 is
the current decaying region. With the different hole mobilities,
the peak value of the region 1 is approximately the same,
and the slope of the region 2 decreases as the hole mobility
increases. As a result, we can find that the hole current
spreading length is 1-2 µm and approximately the same due to
the higher peak value of the region one even though the higher
hole mobility makes the current spread out. In addition, we
also simulate a series of distances D, including 100 µm, 50
µm, 25 µm, and 10 µm, respectively. The curve of the current
distribution for different distances D are similar whether in
the region 1 or region 2 as shown in Fig. 10(f). Hence, the
hole current spreading length is still the same. The results
show the slope of the current decay is only influenced by the
hole resistivity. In addition, the brown diamond symbol line
in Fig. 2(f) shows the result of LED structure where the p-
electrode is sandwiched by two n-metal electrode. The peak
current value of region 1 reduce significantly in the vertical
LED with two-sided electrodes. The hole current spreading
length increases to 5µm consequently. In summary, the slope
for current decaying of the region 2 is more dependent on the
parameters of the epilayer rather than the distance between
the two electrodes. With the additional current flow path, the
peak value of the region 1 is reduced so that it can affectively
enlarge the hole current spreading length. We can also find
that a distance between the n- and p-electrode is better than the
overlapping of electrodes when considering the light extraction
while it provides much higher the forward voltage drop as
compared with the typical vertical LED.
From previous discussion, we find that if the number of the
current flow path is increased, the current crowding effect can

lowered.
III. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, in order to reduce the channel resistance
of the horizontal LED, the vertical LED is used to improve
the device performance. Our studies show that a typical
vertical LED is not good enough to spread the current and
enhance the light output even with a TCO layer. Therefore,
we designed separated electrode patterns to obtain a higher
light extraction. However, the current is quite non-uniform so
that we investigate the current spreading length. The result
shows that the current spreading length is about 1-2 µm of
our model and is more depending on the number of current
flow paths rather than the parameters of the epilayer and
the distance between the two electrodes. Furthermore, if the
number of current flow paths increases, the current crowded
effect can be significantly improved so that current spreading
effect is promoted due the reduction of the peak value in region
one. In addition, for a better light extraction, the electrodes
should not be overlapped because the most current will directly
flow under the top-electrode to the bottom because of the
smallest resistance path. There are some trade-offs between
the current spreading and the light extraction. Thus, we design
the stripe-shaped electrode to supply a good balance between
the current spreading and light extraction and we can obtain
the optimization by tuning the spacing between each stripe of
the p-electrode. Moreover, for a series of the spacing between
n- and p-electrode, we can find that if the area of the p-
electrode is larger, the radiative recombination will become
more uniform. Otherwise, if the spacing is upon to zero and
the peak value of the radiative recombination rate is near the
edge of the n-electrode so that the light extraction is decreased
instead.
• PART III − Semipolar InGaN/GaN Quantum Well
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, InGaN/GaN quantum wells have been
widely used in several areas such as liquid crystal display
(LCD) backlight module, blue-ray laser diode (LD) and solid
state lighting. However, due to the strong polarization field
caused by the strained InGaN layer in the c-plane, the
quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) is induced and the
internal quantum efficiency is reduced. The alloying of high
indium composition in InGaN-based quantum well structure
will not only lead to the higher lattice mismatch but also
influence the growth quality of the material. As a result, there
exists a “green-yellow gap” in light emitting diodes (LEDs).

Fig. 15. The polarization ratio (|Y ′〉 to |X′〉) of light emitted from an
InxGa1−xN/GaN quantum well as a function of crystal angle. The well width
is 3 nm and injection carrier density is 1.5×1012 cm−2.
up the |Y ′〉 state. It means that the two kinds of strain effects
compete with each other, and results in the switching of the
energy band positions. If we compared the 30% InGaN to 50%
InGaN from θ = 13 to 52 degree, we can find that the energy
separation of first state to the second state becomes larger
due to the stronger influence of the shear strain. A switching
behavior is observed for indium composition larger than 40%.
From Fig. 2, we can find that the better polarization ratio can
be achieved at θ around 15◦ to 30◦ and 75◦ to 90◦.
In the previous case, we show the result for a bulk strained
InGaN alloy film, where the quantum confinement effect is not
considered. Here, we further include the quantum confinement
effect in a strained InGaN quantum well. Figure 15 shows the
polarization ratio of an InGaN/GaN quantum well as a function
of crystal angle for different indium compositions. Similar to
the strained bulk InGaN alloy film, the InGaN-based quantum
well system with growth orientation along θ = 75◦ − 90◦
has higher polarization ratio. However, due to the limit of the
growth technique, it is not possible for all arbitrary growth ori-
entation. And the most common semipolar planes mentioned
earlier are along (112¯2) and (101¯3¯) directions, which is rotated
58◦ and 32◦ from c-axis, respectively. Therefore, we will
studied in detail for the light emission polarization properties
of (112¯2) and (101¯3¯) semipolar InGaN/GaN quantum wells.
Semipolar (112¯2) InGaN quantum well has attracted a great
attention for green light emitters. There are some studies
indicating that the indium incorporation of the (112¯2) InGaN-
based quantum well is similar to or even greater than that
of the c-plane one. As a result, there is a strong potential in
the (112¯2) semipolar LEDs for long wavelength light emitter
application such as green and yellow LEDs. Figures 16(a) and
16(b) show the valence band structure of the InGaN-based
semipolar (112¯2) quantum well with indium composition equal
to 20% and 50%, respectively. We can find that the subband
mixed with |X ′〉-like and |Z ′〉-like states becomes the topmost
band for the 50% indium case. And for 20% indium case, the
state is purely dominated by |Y ′〉-like state. It is due to that
the contribution of the shear strain effect becomes significant
in the high indium composition case. Therefore, the switching
phenomenon occurs in the indium composition near 40% to
50%. It means that the |X ′〉+|Z ′〉 subband is lifted up to be
the topmost subband.

Fig. 16. The valence band dispersion relation of the (112¯2) (intersects the c-
plane at 58◦) semipolar InxGa1−xN/GaN quantum well. (a) x=0.2, (b) x=0.5.
Figures 17(a) and 17(b) show the relative energy separation
of the |Y ′〉 subband to the |X ′〉+|Z ′〉 subband and the polar-
ization ratios of the InGaN/GaN (112¯2) semipolar quantum
well as a function of the indium composition, respectively.
Because the shear strain, ϵxz , becomes dominant as the indium
composition increases, the relative energy separation decreases
as the indium composition increases. It is worth noting that
the relative energy separation of the 20% indium composition
is slightly larger than that of the 10% indium composition
because the crystal-field energy∆1 of InN is larger than that of
GaN. In addition, the relative energy separation in the quantum
well is similar to that of the strained alloy film since the
effective mass difference of the two subband states is small.
As shown in Fig. 17(b), we can find that the polarization ratios
decrease as the indium composition increases because the x′-
polarized and z′-polarized components become stronger. As
shown in Fig. 17(a), there is a switch between |Y ′〉-like state
and |X ′〉+|Z ′〉 like state near 40% indium composition. It has
shown a good agreement with some published experimental
works, which the polarization switching is observed around
30% indium composition.
Figures 18(a) and 18(b) show the relative energy separation
and the polarization ratio as a function of well width for
different indium compositions, respectively. As mentioned
earlier, the effective mass of the |X ′〉+|Z ′〉 subband is slightly
larger than that of the |Y ′〉 subband. Therefore, for indium
composition smaller than 40% where the |Y ′〉-liked is the
first subband, the smaller quantum well width will make the
two subbands closer. When the indium composition is larger
than 40%, |Y ′〉-liked subband becomes the second subband
and smaller quantum well width will make the separation of
two subbands larger. As we know, since the QCSE is weaker

一、參加會議經過 
7/10 出發前往英國 Glasgow. 
7/11 飛機於早上八點抵達 Glasgow 機場，由於會議早上九點半有 plenary session, 因
此，寄放行李後，直接抵達會場開會，早上有兩個 Plenary talk, 分別是由 prof. Umesh 
Mishra 和 Prof. Amano 給的演講。Prof. Mishra 在我學生時代有一些合作關係，由於時間
很趕，只有趕上 Prof. Mishra 後半部的演講，剛好他聽到他對 nitride high power 元件的最
進新發展和新設計方式作了個總結，算是快速了解了我畢業後的最新發展，收穫頗豐。
Prof. Amano 對 NITRIDE 元件在太陽能電池的應用探討了可行性的方向－不過最大的癥
結還是在長晶和極化電場造成的空乏區改變所可能的影響。中午開始分成三個
SESSION，一個以探討 LED 元件設計為止，來討論效率問題，一個以長晶為主，一個以
高功率元件為主，由於本身研究領域的關係，主要是聚焦在 LED 元件設計的探討。 
下午 SESSION 也是以相關題目為主。傍晚為 poster session. 。 
7/12 早上的 SESSION 最要以 InGaN Laser diode 還有開始一些 AlN 為主的 UV LED 和
nonpolar plane 材料特性的討論，另外有高速高功率元件的探討，由於高速高功率元件對
未來新的工業發展非常重要，比如車用高功率轉換元件需要耐高溫等特性，因此我主要
是待在高功率高速元件的 section。傍晚為 poster section，裡面有許多很有趣的 POSTER
探討一些良策的問題。 
7/13 我們實驗室下午要發表第一篇論文[1]，由我自己親自發表，也得到一些學者的回
饋，算是一個不錯的經驗，論文發表完後，繼續參加下午的 POSTER section 和一些教授
在 poster section 分享一些研究心得。 
7/14 早上我們實驗室由我學生賴冠中口頭發表另外一篇論文，也獲得不少討論和回饋，
下午為 CONFERENCE 的 Excursion time. 晚上為會議晚宴 
7/15 早上仍然有一個 late news section 和最後兩個 plenary talk ，在討論 nanorod LED 的
未來和 laser 的發展，其中 coreshell 的設計似乎比較有機會但是磊晶技術可能得在研究改
