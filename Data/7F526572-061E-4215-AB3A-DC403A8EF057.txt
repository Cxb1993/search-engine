Novel Synthesis of High-Surface-Area Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 with 
Anatase Framework for Photocatalytic Applications 
 
Abstract 
Ordered mesoporous TiO2 materials with an anatase framework have been synthesized by using 
a cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TMABr) as a structure-directing agent 
and soluble peroxytitanates as Ti precursor through a self-assembly between the positive charged 
surfactant S+ and the negatively charged inorganic framework I− (S+I− type). The low-angle X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-prepared mesoporous TiO2 materials indicates a hexagonal 
mesostructure. XRD and transmission electron microscopy results and nitrogen 
adsorption-desorption isotherms measurements indicate the calcined mesoporous TiO2 possesses an 
anatase crystalline framework having a maximum pore size of 6.9 nm and a maximum 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area of 284 m2g-1. This ordered mesoporous anatase TiO2 
also demonstrates a high photocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet 
irradiation.

1. Introduction 
In 1992 [1], Mobil researchers disclosed the first family of highly ordered mesoporous molecular 
sieves M41S (pore size in the range 20-100 Å), where long chain cationic surfactants were used as 
the pore forming agents during the hydrothermal sol-gel synthesis. Depending on the starting 
materials and synthesis conditions, different mesoporous silica oxides with ordered structure in the 
form of hexagonal (MCM-41) [2], cubic (MCM-48) [3], and lamella (MCM-50) [4], were formed. 
Since then, many synthetic routes and strategies have been developed to yield a wide diversity of 
materials of various frameworks with different chemical compositions and pore structures. Through a 
modified sol-gel approach, Antonelli and Ying prepared a stable mesoporous amorphous titanium 
dioxide by controlled hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in the presence of tetradecylphosphates 
using acetylacetone as the chelating agent [5]. However, the phosphorus in the template could not be 
easily removed by either calcination or solvent extraction; the photocatalytic activity was thus 
hindered by the residual phosphorus [6,7]. Stucky and co-workers applied the same surfactant 
templating strategy as above to the synthesis of mesoporous non-silica oxides [4]. It was found that 
the charge density matching between the organic surfactant (S) and the inorganic species (I) is 
crucial for a successful formation of the organic-inorganic mesophase; yet, lack of thermal stability 
and difficulty to remove the surfactant templates without breakdown of the structural integrity were 
the two major drawbacks [8-11].  
Research on TiO2 covers a wide range from its nanoparticles [12,13], thin films [14,15], to 
4 
 
to completely dissolve and react with H2O2 to form the dark yellow soluble peroxytitanates, the 
formation of peroxytitanates according to Eq. 1 [29]. A second solution (solution II) was prepared by 
adding 9.30 g (25.26 mmole) of cetyltrimethylammonia bromide (C16TMABr, 99 % Arcos) to 43.50 
g of DI water with constant stirring; then 25.00 g (42.44 mmole) of tetraethylammonium hydroxide 
(TEAOH, 25 %, Arcos) was subsequently added. Solution I was added dropwise to the well-stirred 
solution II; the mixture was blended at 15 °C for an additional hour after complete addition of 
solution I, yielding a final pH value = 11.3. The mixture was then transferred to a sealed and 
teflon-lined autoclave under the hydrothermal condition and heated to 80 °C for 2 days. The sol-gel 
synthesis proceeded with varying hydrothermal times (2-10 days, the interval being 2 days), keeping 
a constant hydrothermal temperature at 80 °C. Samples are designated according to the hydrothermal 
time, for example, sample 2d indicates it was hydrothermally treated in the autoclave for 2 days. The 
products were filtered, washed extensively with DI water, and dried in air. They are hereafter called 
the as-prepared samples. The as-prepared samples were then calcined in air for 4 h at 500 °C (heating 
rate = 1 °C /min) to removed the organic moieties. The calcined products were further rewashed with 
DI water to remove the water-soluble residuals and dried at room temperature. Unless otherwise 
indicated, all the data shown in this work are for the calcined samples.

2.2. Characterization 
Crystalline phases were determined by the X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Siemens D-5000, 
Karshrule, Germany) with Cukα radiation and Ni filter operating at 40 kV/30 mA. Microstructure 
was analyzed by the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL™ 6330, Tokyo, 
Japan) equipped with the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra; it was operatied at 10 kV. Samples 
ultrasonicated and filtered on holey carbon grids were examined by the transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM, JEOL™ AEM 3010, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 200 kV. The nitrogen 
adsorption-desorption isotherms (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics) at –196 °C were measured to 
determine the BET specific surface area; the pore size and pore volume were obtained from the 
Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. All samples were vacuum-dried at 105 °C overnight before 
measurement.  
2.3. Measurement of Photocatalytic Activity 
The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the degradation of MB under UV 
irradiation. In each experiment, a suspension containing 20 mg of calcined mesoporous TiO2 catalyst 
and 20 ml of aqueous MB solution (50 mgL-1) was continuously stirred in a glass flask for 30 min in 
the dark. The duration in the dark period must be long enough to ensure complete diffusion of MB 
molecules into the mesopores such that a constant concentration of MB was obtained before UV 
irradiation. The UV light was provided by a 4-watt Mineralight hand-held lamp (UVGL-25, 
Ultra-Violet Products, Inc.) with a wavelength of 254 nm. The distance between light source and the 
surface of the solution was 5 cm and the sample area for testing was fixed at 10 cm2. The irradiated 
mixture solution was centrifuged and the change of MB concentration of the TiO2-free solution as 
6 
 
attributed to the presence of large pore channels. In general, the porous adsorbents (e.g., inorganic 
oxide gels and porous glasses) often tend to give type IV pore structure and type H2 hysteresis loop; 
however, the distribution of the pore size and shape is not well-defined. It was typically attributed to 
a difference in mechanism between condensation and evaporation processes occurring in pores with 
narrow necks and wide bodies (as referred to the 'ink bottle' model). The hysteresis between the 
adsorption isotherm and desorption isotherm is generally thought to be caused by the gradual 
desorption mechanism (percolation theory) due to the different size of pores being combined. On the 
other hand, BJH analysis on the desorption isotherm shown in Figure 4 (inset) reveals a regular size 
of the pore channel in the mesoporous region with average pore diameter of 6.9 nm. 
A typical TEM image (sample 6d) shown in Figure 5a for the calcined mesophase anatase TiO2 
material shows a wormlike pore structure. To our best knowledge, a completely regular arrangement 
of the mesopores from TEM has not been reported for the calcined mesophase anatase TiO2 materials 
so far, although the hexagonal mesophase has been confirmed with no doubt for the as-prepared 
samples [6,8-11,17,25]. Its selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Figure 5b indicates 
discernible Debye-Sherrer rings of (101), (004), (200), (105), and (204) diffractions which are 
characteristic of the anatase phase. Thus, the wall with a wormlike structure is comprised of 
nanocrystalline anatase titanium oxides, consistent with those findings from XRD study in Figure 3. 
3.2. Effect of Hydrothermal Time 
A series of experiments were conducted to determine the influence of the hydrothermal time (2-10 
days) on the mesophase structure and photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 prepared. A close 
examination on the XRD patterns (Figure 2a) reveals the hexagonal mesophase gradually diminishes 
for those as-prepared samples with hydrothermal time greater than 6 days; similar trend can be 
observed for those calcined TiO2 (Figure 2b). 
Numerous spherical particulates of ~ 2 μm in diameter spreading all over the matrix material in 
sample 8d under SEM (Figure 6b and c) are observed, in contrast to a relatively smooth and 
homogeneous surface topology of sample 6d (Figure 6a). EDX analysis indicates further that these 
regular spherical particulates contain mostly Ti element (Figure 6d). The formation mechanism of 
these spherical particulates is not fully understood at this point; yet they may be the major factor 
responsible for the collapse of the ordered mesophase. It is argued that in a prolonged sol-gel 
synthesis under the critical hydrothermal condition (> 6 days), a denser TiO2 is highly likely formed 
near the end of the condensation reaction, resulting in a reduced positive charge density on the 
titanium framework [25,28]. Whether or not the cationic surfactants were reassembled in a prolonged 
sol-gel process under the critical hydrothermal condition remains suspicious, even though they were 
definitely affected by the reduced charge density on the titanium framework. Thus, the speculation 
on the formation of the spherical TiO2 particulates due to the reassembled surfactants can not be 
quite justified. It is found that the interaction between the partially hydrolyzed titanium oxo clusters 
(or Ti–O nanoparticles) and the surfactant molecules through electrostatic interactions could be the 
main cause [31]. The nano-sized particulate precursors may first be formed, followed by the 
8 
 
irradiated TiO2 from the first stage and the fresh MB solution. It yields a MB reduction of 63 % for 
sample 6d in the initial 10 min (Figure 7b), against the reference P-25 which gives only < 7.5 % 
reduction under the same condition; all the other mesoporous anatase TiO2 prepared in this study also 
show better photocatalytic efficiency than P-25. This suggests that the adsorbed MB molecules in the 
mesopores of the titania during the first stage of irradiation were already destroyed before the 
commencement of the second stage of irradiation, for the mesoporous anatase TiO2 samples would be 
“poisoned” by the MB molecules if they were only adsorbed to the mesopores without further 
catalysis. The results from the second irradiation indicate a reasonably satisfactory photocatalytic 
effect of the samples prepared in this work. The remarkable photocatalytic efficiency can be 
attributed to the associated effects of high specific surface area, pure anatase crystalline framework, 
and structural ordering of the mesopores. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Ordered mesoporous TiO2 materials with an anatase framework have been successfully 
synthesized via a cationic surfactant-assisted sol-gel synthesis under hydrothermal condition through 
an S+I− self-assembly pathway. A hexagonal mesophase for the mesopores is identified by low-angle 
XRD and an anatase crystalline phase for the framework is identified by wide-angle XRD and TEM. 
This hexagonal mesophase is destroyed under high calcination temperatures, while the anatase phase 
remains unchanged. Results from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the mesoporous TiO2 
materials show a pore structure of type IV and a hysteresis loop of type H2, with a highest specific 
surface area of 284 m2g-1 and an average pore size of 6.9 nm. A prolonged sol-gel synthesis under the 
critical hydrothermal conditions (> 8 days) results in the formation of some spherical particulates 
which further induce the collapse of the ordered mesophase. All the mesoporous anatase TiO2 
prepared in this study show superior photocatalytic efficiency than the commercial P-25; sample 6d 
with the highest specific surface area and the most ordered mesostructure gives a total MB 
concentration reduction of 95 %  within only 10 min during the first stage of irradiation. A further 
reduction of 63% on the added fresh MB in the second stage of irradiation reveals that the adsorbed 
MB has been destroyed. The remarkable photocatalytic efficiency can be attributed to the associated 
effects of high specific surface area, pure anatase crystalline framework and structural ordering of the 
mesopores. 
 
5. Self-Appraisal 
We reported the major results and achievement derived from this project which is aimed to 
conduct a fundamental investigation on a novel sol-gel synthesis of an ordered mesoporous TiO2 with 
an anatase framework exhibiting high specific surface area and high photocatalytic efficiency by 
using a cationic template approach under hydrothermal condition. A water-soluble peroxytitanate 
was adopted as the Ti precursor to give a retarded condensation reaction such that the formation of a 
dense titania network was prohibited and the ordered mesophase was ensured under the
