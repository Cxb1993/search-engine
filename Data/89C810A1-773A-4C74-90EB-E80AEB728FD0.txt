Malvern Insitec Ensemble Particle 
Concentration and Size (EPCS) system, which 
uses laser diffraction to measure particle size.  
The focal length of the lens of the EPCS meter 
is 450 mm and it can detect particles ranging 
from 2.25 to 1000 μm in size, see Fig. 1.  
Each measurement was located at a point 55 
mm (L = 55 mm) downstream from the nozzle 
tip.  Further, the EPCS measurement of 
droplet sizes were performed in three planes 
downstream of the injector tip (L = 0), that is, 
L = 30, 60, 80 mm.  In each plane, several 
points at the different radial coordinate were 
measured. It must be noted that each 
measurement was tested taking 10s for 200 
pulses at the injection rate of 20 Hz.

3. Results and Discussions 
 
The dynamic flow rates against the 
injection pressure at different injection time are 
shown in Fig. 2.  The dynamic flow rates 
increase with increasing the injection pressure 
and the injection time.  At the longer injection 
time (e.g. longer than 10 ms), the influence of 
the injection pressure on the dynamic flow rate 
is more significant.  Table 2 shows the 
dynamic flow rates at different injection time 
as using 10 MPa injection pressure.

The droplet sizes varying with the 
injection pressure at different injection time are 
shown in Fig. 3.  Among all injection times, 
the droplet sizes are smaller at a higher 
injection pressure as the injection pressure 
under 7 MPa.  Above 7 MPa, the SMD is 
settled to 6-15 μm.  It reveals that the 
injection time plays a minor role in the droplet 
sizes.  Thus, the dynamic flow rate can be 
control by varying the injection time regardless 
of its effect on the droplet sizes.  Moreover, 
the droplet sizes are not sensitive for the 
injection pressure as it is higher than 7 MPa.  
But they were measured only at 55mm 
downstream from the injector tip.  It needs to 
be further examined the distribution of the 
droplet sizes in a V-shaped fan of spray.

The distribution of droplet sizes at the 
 4
Based on the measurement of droplet 
distributions, the injection pressure is 
suggested to be above 10 MPa to obtain smaller 
droplet sizes and more concentrated droplet 
distributions.  Furthermore, the increase of the 
injection time let the droplet distributions to be 
further slightly concentrated. As a basis of 
these results, the fuel/oxidizer mixture 
composition in liquid fueled PDEs can be 
controlled.  Next, the spray of Jet A-1 with air 
will be initiated by a detonation wave that is 
generated via propane/oxygen mixture in our 
pervious studies. 
 
During the progress of this project, Mr. J, 
Li was granted from NSC to visit University of 
Texas at Arlington, and after his visit for 6 
months, the principal investigator went to UT 
Arlington for the international cooperation visit. 
Prof. Wilson and Prof. Frank Lu welcome us 
warmly, and meet us two days to discuss the 
future application of detonation to the gas 
turbine. We initiate two patents after brain 
storming, and we agreed to have all the names 
of attendee of that meeting [11-12] to share the 
intellectual patents as well as application fee of 
IP. During this year, there is one more 
publications accepted from journal [13]. 
Besides, Mr. J. Lee returned to Taiwan at the 
end of last year, and he finished his PhD 
dissertation [14] in June. The overall 
achievement of this program is very fruitful 
and excellent, and PI is very satisfactory.

本發明目的在將能量轉換使用爆震波(detonations)於一往復式引擎。
在目前的內燃機（IC）引擎常使用火星塞或壓縮點火，但燃燒現象均為
爆燃(deflagration)，引擎設計者儘量減少爆震以減少機械及熱應力問題。
但在基礎熱力學得知爆震波(detonations)較爆燃(deflagrations)擁有較高之
效率。隨即得到高壓及作功之能量，最近之研究顯示，震波引擎除有潛
力用於推進方面，甚至更能應用於發電系統，故此概念可應用於往復式
引擎上，即震波往復式引擎（The detonation reciprocating engine，DRE), 預
將較目前 IC 引擎擁有更高效率。 
技術說明 
英文： 
The purpose of the invention is energy conversion using pulsed detonations in an 
internal combustion, reciprocating engine (IC).  The combustion process in present 
IC engines, either spark or compression ignition, is known as deflagration, which can 
be considered to be a constant pressure process.  Much effort has been expended to 
develop fuel blends to prevent detonation, known commonly as knocking. 
Knocking is detrimental for such engines due to the high mechanical and thermal 
stresses, and noise. 
It is known from fundamental thermodynamics that detonations are more efficient 
than deflagration.  Detonations are constant volume processes which develop very 
high pressure that is then available for work.  Sufficient R&D has been undertaken 
to demonstrate the potential of detonations for propulsion.  However, only lately has 
work been performed to demonstrate the power production capability of detonations. 
The device that we have conceived is to adapt the IC engine for pulse detonations.  
The detonation reciprocating engine (DRE) is expected to be more efficient than 
existing ICs.
