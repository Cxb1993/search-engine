B. Bullington’s Method 
Consider the case that when there are two or more shield 
objects between the 
xR  and the xT , the Bullington’s method [5] 
represents the shield objects as a single equivalent obstacle. 
Thereafter, the knife-edge diffraction model can be applied to 
simulate the diffraction loss for the multiple obstacles scenario 
by using the equivalent obstacle depicted in Fig.2. 
C. Giovanelli Method 
A geometric illustration of the Giovanelli method is 
depicted in Fig.3. First we use Eq.(2) to find the v  parameters 
for all shield objects. The largest v  represent the main shield 
object. In the left and right regions of the main shield object, 
the Giovanelli method adopts Eq.(2) again to find the 
secondary shield object. The effective height '1h  of the main 
shield object and the effective height '2h  of the secondary 
shield object are

D. The Proposed Three-Ray Concept 
For the conventional knife-edge, the Bullington’s and the 
Giovanelli methods, all consider only the wave propagation 
through the top of the shield object. In the scenario of the IVC, 
these methods are not suitable because the vehicles affect the 
shadowing degradation only on the portions blocking the radio 
propagation from the 
xT . Therefore, a simple three-ray 
modification for the IVC can be shown in Fig.4. If there are 
shield vehicles between the 
xR  and the xT , xR  receives the

calculation of the diffraction loss. Fig.7 illustrates the field 
measurements and simulation results for the modified three-ray 
method and the knife-edge method. Obviously, the proposed 
three-ray modification can approximate the field-measured 
results more accurate than the convention knife-edge method. 
Besides, we can note that the shadowing effect is very serious 
when the shield vehicle is about 10 meters near the 
xR  or the 
xT . Other than the 10m regions, the shadowing degradation 
remains a constant. (-8dB in this experiment) 
B. Two Shield Vehicles Case 
Consider the influence of two shield vehicles on the 
shadowing effect in the IVC, the distance between the 
xR  and 
the 
xT  is at 70m. As shown in Fig.8(a), the vehicle-1 was fixed 
at the middle location between the 
xR  and the xT  and the 
vehicle-2 moved from the 
xR  toward the fixed vehicle. 
Fig.8(b) is another case where the vehicle-1 was fixed near the 
xR  and the vehicle-2 was moving from the fixed vehicle to the 
xT .  
In Fig.8, the Bullington’s method is used to obtain an 
equivalent obstacle from the two shield objects. Then the 
diffraction loss is calculated by the knife-edge diffraction 
model and the modified three-ray knife-edge diffraction model. 
Fig.9 depicts the final simulation and measurement results. 
Similar as the single shield vehicle case, the modified three-ray 
method has a better approximation than the Bullington’s and 
the Giovanelli methods. 
C.  Transmission Distance under the Shadowing Effect 
Here, we conduct a simulation to analyze the relation of the 
effective transmission distance versus the penetration rate (the 
percentage of the vehicles equipped with the communication 
device) via using the proposed modified three-ray shadowing 
model. The channels used in the simulation can be divided into 
two cases: one is the LOS, and the other is the non-LOS 
(NLOS). That is, if there is no shield vehicle between the 
xR  
and the 
xT , the transmission channel is modeled as a LOS 
scenario and the instantaneous received power is calculated via 
the Friss equation with the Rician fading. Otherwise, the 
transmission channel is modeled as a NLOS scenario and the 
instantaneous received power is calculated by the Friss 
equation with the Rayleigh fading and the shadowing effect [8], 
[9]. The received power rP   is calculated as

Abstract— In this paper, we propose a Constant Pilot Padding 
Method (CPPM) that can perform both the timing 
synchronization and channel estimation in the Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The CPPM 
method exploits the repetitive structure of the preamble generated 
by inserting the constant pilots in the frequency domain to execute 
the timing synchronization. In addition, the CPPM method has 
the ability of channel estimation with these padding pilots. 
Compared with the conventional synchronization methods, such 
as the S&C method and the Park’s method, the preamble of the 
CPPM provides not only timing synchronization but also data 
transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed method is 
more precise and robust than the S&C method and the Park’s 
method.

OFDM 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
RTHOGONAL Frequency Division Multiplexing 
(OFDM) has been widely adopted in the current wireless 
communication systems, such as IEEE802.11a/g, Digital 
Video Broadcasting for Handheld (DVB-H), and IEEE802.16 
Wireless MAN, due to its high bandwidth efficiency and the 
ability of overcoming frequency selective fading channel. To 
accomplish the frequency synchronization and the symbol 
detection, an OFDM system has to establish the timing 
synchronization [1]-[11] firstly. Two types of timing 
synchronization methods can be classified: one is the 
data-aided schemes [1]-[5] that design a preamble structure 
suitable for timing synchronization. For example, the S&C 
method [1] and the Park’s method [2] use the repetitive 
preamble to estimate the timing offset. These methods use the 
PN (pseudo-noise) sequence in the frequency domain to 
generate preamble with a specific repetitive form. The second 
type of the timing synchronization is the non-data-aided 
schemes [6]-[11]. [6] exploits the cyclic prefix (CP) structure of 
OFDM symbol and performs the Maximum Likelihood 
Estimation (MLE) for the timing offset. [7] uses a BPSK 
modulated signal to carry out a blind timing synchronization. 
However, the estimation performance of the non-data-aided 
schemes are generally poor than the data-aided methods. 
In this paper, we propose a Constant Pilot Padding Method 
(CPPM) that has both the timing synchronization and the 
channel estimation abilities. Compared with the S&C method 
 
 
and the Park’s method, the repetitive structure of the preamble 
is generated by inserting constant pilots in the frequency 
domain rather than the PN sequences. Besides, the generated 
preamble can also carry the modulated information symbols to 
improve the disadvantage of inefficiency bandwidth usage of 
the conventional data-aided methods. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the 
proposed CPPM method and the corresponding repetitive 
preamble structure will be described in detail. Besides, the 
linear interpolated channel estimation via using the padding 
pilots will also be illustrated. Simulation results of the proposed 
CPPM method, the S&C method and the Park’s method are 
investigated in Section III. Some conclusions for this paper are 
given in Section IV.  
 
II. METHOD  DESCRIPTION 
The proposed OFDM system that exploits Constant Pilot 
Padding Method (CPPM) with data padding interval I=2 is 
shown in Fig.1. Before the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform 
(IFFT), the padding pilots P along with the modulated data Xk 
are arranged as

Similar results can be observed if different padding interval I

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, we compare the proposed CPPM method with 
the Park’s and the S&C methods for the BPSK and QPSK 
modulations respectively. The number of subcarrier is 256, the 
length of the inserted CP is 64 samples and the channel delay 
time is 256 samples. 
A. Performance of Timing Offset Estimation 
Fig.6 is the simulation result if we compare the CPPM 
method with the Park’s method under the AWGN channel with 
SNR=20dB. The timing metric M  is defined directly from the 
Park method as

offset is the timing index with the maximum metric value in 
Eq.(11).

Note that for the Park’s method, the peak of the metric will 
occur at the middle of the preamble. Fig.6 shows that both 
methods can estimate the timing offset 447 (=256+64+128-1) 
correctly. 
Compared with the Park’s method, the proposed CPPM 
method can insert the modulated information symbols on the 
even subcarriers instead of the the real-valued PN sequences. 
If we compare the CPPM with the S&C method and use the 
S&C timing metric defined in Eq.(12)~(14). For the S&C 
method, the peak of the timing metric occurs at the beginning of 
the generated preamble. Fig.7 illustrates the simulation result 
under the AWGN channel with SNR=20dB.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we propose a CPPM method that can perform 
both the timing synchronization and channel estimation in the 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 
systems. According to simulations, the CPPM method has more 
accurate timing estimation than the S&C method and has 
similar performance compared with the Park’s method. 
However, the CPPM method is more robust than the Park’s 
method. Besides, the CPPM method can also transmit the 
modulated information symbols in the preamble to improve the 
disadvantage of inefficiency bandwidth usage of the 
conventional data-aided timing synchronization methods.

 constant padded pilot P  are inserted into the subcarriers as 
Eq.(1). After the IFFT operation, the preamble of the CPPM 
method will have a repetitive time domain structure shown 
in Fig.2(c). The number of repetitive waveform is 
determined by the padding interval I . Compared with 
conventional data-aided schemes [1,2], the CPPM method 
can improve the disadvantage of inefficient bandwidth 
utilization because it can insert additional modulated 
symbols along with pilot signal to generate the preamble.

Preamble 
 
The repetitive structure of the CPPM preamble depends 
on the modulation of the inserted symbols kX  and the data 
padding interval I . For example, if the kX  are QPSK or 
QAM modulated symbols and the padding interval I =2, the 
real part and the imaginary part of the generated time-
domain waveform of the CPPM preamble can be depicted in 
Fig.3. Its waveform contains I  repetitions. More detail 
features can be found in [4].

Where * denotes the complex conjugate, ( )s n  is the

That is, the estimation range depends on the padding

After the coarse CFO compensation, based on the non-

An OFDM system can adopt the suitable numbers of 
segment for grouping to apply the proposed iterative method.  
III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, we use the computer simulations to 
evaluate the performance of the proposed iterative CFO 
estimation method. Assume that the number of subcarriers is 
256, the length of the CP is 64 samples. Table.3 lists the 
parameters for the computer simulations. Besides, we adopt 
the Wu-Model [5] to generate the Rayleigh fading channel.

Fig.6 and Fig.7 are the simulation results for the 
repetition method (Method-1), repetition with CP method 
(Method-2) and the proposed iterative method at the 5km/hr 
and 70km/hr respectively. Results show that the iterative 
method has the best MSE performance. Compared with the 
Method-2, the iterative method has the similar MSE 
performance at the high SNR scenarios. However, the 
iterative method has a better MSE performance at the low 
SNR region. Fig.8 and Fig.9 are the corresponding 
simulations if we increase the number I to 32 for the CPPM 
preamble and compare the iterative method with the 
Tufvesson method [1]. Tufvesson method uses a preamble 
generated by a repetitive PN sequence. To have a fair 
comparison, the Tuffvesson preamble also contains 32 
repetitions of PN sequences. Similarly, the proposed 
iterative method has the best MSE performance among these 
methods. Besides, comparing Fig.8~9 with Fig.6~7, the 
MSE performance becomes poor if the number of repetition 
I of the preamble increases. This phenomenon is consistent 
with the simulation in Section II.
