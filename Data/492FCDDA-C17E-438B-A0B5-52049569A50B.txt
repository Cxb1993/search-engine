0BAbstract 
The medium access control (MAC) protocol for ad 
hoc network as defined in IEEE 802.11 requires all the 
other nodes in the vicinity of two communicating nodes 
to stay silence in order not to cause possible collisions. 
This may not only induce the hidden terminal and 
exposed terminal problems but also severely degrade 
system throughput. Ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse 
radio (IR) technology has some attractive features that 
offer great flexibility in the design of a multiaccess ad 
hoc network. In this work, we aim at developing a smart 
antenna based MAC protocol for time-hopping UWB 
(TH-UWB) wireless ad hoc network. Unlike the 
contentionless protocols, the TH-UWB is not only a 
physical layer modulation but also a MAC layer multiple 
access scheme. Moreover, to further enhance the spatial 
reuse and system throughput, the access mode 
considered in this project combines TH-UWB with 
space-division multiple-access (SDMA) technology. The 
performances in terms of several design parameters are 
extensively analyzed to meet specific quality-of-service 
(QoS) requirements. 
Keywords: Ad hoc networks, Quality-of-service (QoS), 
Medium access control (MAC), UWB beamforming, 
time-hopping UWB (TH-UWB). 
 
二、計畫緣由與目的 
Recently, considerable attention was paid to UWB 
impulse radio (IR) systems due to its attractive features 
that include low-power carrierless modulation and ample 
multipath diversity [1-5]. Moreover, it is being 
considered to apply to short to medium range mobile 
wireless ad hoc communication networks (MANETs) [6, 
7] because of the promising technique for high data rate, 
precise ranging capability, and resistance to multipath 
fading. UWB IR is a spread-spectrum technique that 
stems from transmitting a stream of pulses of very short 
duration (on the order of nanosecond or less) and with 
very low duty cycle. When such transmissions are 
applied in multiple access system, where several users 
are allowed to share the same radio resource 
simultaneously, unique time-hopping (TH) code should 
be assigned to each link in order not to cause 
catastrophic interference [4-5, 8-10]. 
MANETs have received extensive interest because of the 
ability to provide temporary wireless networking 
capability in scenarios where fixed infrastructures are 
not available. The fundamental challenge in 
MANETs is how to increase the overall network 
throughput while maintaining low energy 
consumption for data packet transmission. To avoid 
collision of packets over the wireless channel, there 
is a basic rule in IEEE 802.11 MAC protocols: a 
node does not attempt a transmission when it senses 
at the mth sensor (antenna) can be expressed as

(assume independent of m for simplicity). In order to 
compensate the time delay, or equivalently, forming main 
lobe of the beam pattern to the desired direction, a set of 
adjustable delays sind
cφ
τ = φ  are inserted at each 
receive antenna, where φ  is the steering angle. Without 
loss of generality, we consider the first link’s receiver. To 
extract the desired signal ( )1s t  from each receive 
antenna, we set

3. Array-aided link establish procedure 
RT A wants to communicate with RT B 
Step 1: In signaling phase, RT A uses omni-directional 
antenna to notify RT B its intention to start a 
communication. This signal is also heard by the 
neighboring RTs, which means, RT A broadcasts 
the signaling message using TH code 0. These 
neighboring RTs are then triggered to signal its 
MSI. 
Step 2: In measuring phase, all RTs report their own MSI 
message using the same TH codes. These MSI 
messages sent from different RTs can be 
differentiated by spatial diversity, i.e., each 
antenna is responsible (using variable delay) for 
receiving the MSI from one RT. 
Step 3: When RTA acquires all the MSI information of 
its neighboring RTs, it begins to calculate { }1 maxmin , alloweda E E=% . If 1 0a >%  and
