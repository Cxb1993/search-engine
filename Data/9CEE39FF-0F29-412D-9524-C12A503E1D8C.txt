Introduction 
 Interconnection networks play a major role in the performance of modern parallel computers. 
There are a lot of mutually conflicting demands in designing the topology of computer networks. It 
is almost impossible to design a network which is optimum in all perspectives. Low latency and 
load balancing are two factors of all important issues. In order to get the low latency and load 
balancing for data transfer, one method is to transfer data in multiple disjoint paths. Obviously, if 
the paths have the same length, the transfer latency and load balancing are optimal. In general, the 
existence of multiple disjoint paths or short path(s) is beneficial to data transfer. 
In this paper, a network is represented as a loopless undirected graph. For the graph 
definitions and notations, we follow [1]. Let G  be a graph if )(GV  is a finite set and )(GE  is a 
subset of ),(|),{( vuvu  is an unordered pair of V . We say that )(GV  is the  vertex set and 
)(GE  is the  edge set. Two vertices u  and v  are  adjacent if )(),( GEvu ∈ . A path is a 
sequence of adjacent vertices, written as 〉〈 mvvvv ,,,, 210 K , in which all the vertices mvvv ,,, 10 K  
are distinct except possibly mvv =0 . We also write the path 〉〈 mvPv ,,0 , where 〉〈 mvvvP ,,= 10 K . 
The  length of a path P , )(Pl , is the number of edges in P . We also use imvv ),( 0  to represent 
the path joining 0v  and mv  with length i . Let u  and v  be two vertices of G . Let the  distance 
between u  and v , denoted by ),( vudG , be the length of the shortest path of G  joining u  and 
v . The diameter of G  is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices of G . It is proved in 
[3] that nAQ  is a vertex transitive, 1)(2 −n -regular, and 1)(2 −n -connected graph with n2  
vertices for any positive integer n . 
Lemma 1 [3] The diameter of nAQ  is ⎤⎡2

Geodesic pancyclicity of Augmented cubes 
 This section is devoted to illustrating the geodesic pancyclic property of Augmented cubes. 
Next, geodesic cycle and geodesic pancyclic are formally defined and discussed. Then nAQ , 
2≥n , is demonstrated to be geodesic pancyclic.    
  
Definition 8  Let G  be a graph. For two vertices )(, GVvu ∈ , a cycle is called a geodesic cycle 
with u  and v  if a shortest path of G  joining u  and v  lies on the cycle. A geodesic l -cycle 
with u  and v  in G , denoted by );,( GvugCl , is a geodesic cycle of length l .   
 
Let 〉〈 uPvPuC cs ,,,,=  be a geodesic cycle with vertices u  and v , where sP  and cP  are 
two disjoint paths joining u  and v  on C  with ),(=)( vudPl
nAQs
 and )()( cs PlPl ≤ . We call sP  
and cP  as  s-path and  c-path of C , respectively.    
  
Definition 9  Let G  be a graph. For two vertices )(, GVvu ∈ , they are called geodesic pancyclic 
on u  and v  if for every integer l  satisfying |)(|),3},({2 GVlvudmax G ≤≤ , the geodesic cycle 
);,( GvugCl  exists.   
 
  
Definition 10  Let G  be a graph. G  is called geodesic pancyclic if any distinct two vertices on 
G  are geodesic pancyclic on them.   
  
Lemma 11  2AQ  and 3AQ  are geodesic pancyclic.   
Proof:  Since 2AQ  is the complete graph 4K , 2AQ  is geodesic pancyclic. Since 3AQ  is 
vertex-transitive. We assume the starting vertex is 000=u  and consider the destination vertex v  
as the three cases: (1) 11,100}{001,010,0∈v , (2) 111=v , and (3) {101,110}∈v . By the 
symmetry of 3AQ , there is only one vertex is discussed for each case and related geodesic cycles 
of the two cases are listed in Table 1.

Theorem 17 The n -dimensional Augmented cube is balanced pancyclic for 2≥n .   
Proof. We prove this theorem by induction on n . Since 2AQ  is complete graph 4K , 2AQ  is 
balanced pancyclic. By Lemma 16, the theorem holds for 3,4=n . The induction hypothesis is that 
1−nAQ  is balanced pancyclic. Then we consider the case of nAQ . Let u  and v  be any two 
distinct vertices of nAQ . Then we divide the cases by the relative position between u  and v .    
 Case 1: bnAQvu ∈,  for {0,1}∈b . Without loss of generality, we can assume that 
0, nAQvu ∈ . By induction hypothesis, 1−nAQ  is balanced pancyclic. Hence, there exist

Suppose that ),( vu  is not an edge of nAQ . We know 2),( ≥vud nAQ  in this case. By 
Lemma 3, there exist two disjoint shortest paths of nAQ  joining u  and v  with the form 
〉′′〈 vvvuu s ,,),(,  and 〉′′〈 vvuuu s ,),(,,  where all vertices of svu ),( ′  are in 0nAQ  and all vertices of

Conclusions 
 In this paper, we study the existence of cycles with some requirements in nAQ . For given 
two vertices u  and v , the cycle is called geodesic cycle if it contains the shortest path between u  
and v . Clearly, a geodesic cycle can minimize the transmission delay from u  to v . Herein, we 
prove that nAQ  is geodesic pancyclic.    
We also discuss the balanced pancyclic property for load balancing in nAQ . It is of interest to 
find a cycle passing through u  and v  such that lengths of two disjoint paths between u  and v  
in this cycle are as equal as possible. nAQ  is shown to be balanced pancyclic.
