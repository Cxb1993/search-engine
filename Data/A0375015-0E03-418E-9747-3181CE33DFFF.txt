applied in high-speed and high-frequency 
microwave/millimeter-wave electronics over 
the past years [1, 2]. It is known that the 
conventional depletion-mode (D-mode) 
PHEMTs are operated under dual-supply 
voltage sources [3, 4]. In order to reduce the 
power consumption, it is needed to overcome 
the problem associated with the dual-supply 
voltage sources in D-mode PHEMTs. Hence 
the enhancement-mode (E-mode) PHEMTs are 
new candidate solutions to this problem. 
Yet, the E-mode PHEMTs are relatively 
rarely studied due to the difficulties of precise 
control on gate/channel layer thickness [5, 6]. 
The conventional AlAs etch stop layer also 
provides a DX-center source and a high 
oxidation rate in high humidity condition for 
PHEMTs [7]. In addition, for gate recessed 
condition, the high selectivity for GaAs or 
InGaAs over AlxGa1-xAs is ordinarily achieved 
by increasing Al mole fraction (x>0.3) [8]. On 
the other hand, the Schottky contact 
metallization is generally achieved using either 
the conventional thermal evaporation (TE) or 
sputtering technique. The high-temperature and 
high-energy evaporated sources usually cause 
the surface damages, and surface state pinning 
is then resulted in the undesired Fermi-level 
pinning effect [9]. These metal-semiconductor 
(M-S) interfaces degrade both electric 
rectifying properties and gate control 
capabilities. 
Therefore, a new low-temperature 
electrochemical deposition approach, i.e., the 
electroless plating (EP) [10], is first proposed 
to fabricate the AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs D- and 
E-mode PHEMTs. Based on the 
low-temperature and low-energy deposition, 
this approach can form a well-behaved 
Schottky interface with a reduced surface 
damage [10, 11]. The benefits of simple process, 
low cost, and high device performance show 
the promise of the proposed EP approach for 
Ⅲ-Ⅴ electronic applications. 
 
四、研究方法 
The studied PHEMT devices were grown 
on a (100)-oriented semi-insulated (SI) GaAs 
substrate by a metal organic chemical vapor 
deposition (MOCVD) system. The epitaxial 
structure consisted of the buffer, active, barrier, 
and cap structures. The buffer structure was a 
600 nm thick undoped GaAs layer. The active 
structure included a 15 nm thick undoped 
In0.15Ga0.85As strained channel layer, a 5 nm 
thick undoped Al0.24Ga0.76As spacer layer, and a 
Si planar-doped sheet with a doping 
concentration of δ(n+) = 3x1012 cm-2 as a 
carrier supplier layer. The barrier structure was 
a 20 nm thick n-Al0.24Ga0.76As (n = 3x1017cm-3) 
Schottky contact layer. Finally, a 5 nm thick 
n+-GaAs layer was used as the cap structure. 
After epitaxial growth, the devices 
processing procedures are illustrated as follows. 
Mesa isolation was achieved by wet chemical 
etching. After mesa isolation, the drain-source 
Ohmic contacts were formed on the GaAs cap 
layer by evaporating AuGe/Au metals and 
alloyed at 330oC for 35 s. After forming drain 
and source Ohmic contacts, the solution of 
H3PO4: H2O2: H2O (1:1:50) was used to 
remove the GaAs cap layer. The Pd gate 
Schottky contact was formed by EP on the 
Schottky contact layer. The EP process 
included: (a) the surface pretreatment, (b) 
pattern transferred by photolithography, (c) 
hard-baking on hot-plate at 110 °C for 40 min, 
(d) immersion of the sample in an EP bath for 
depositing Pd film as the Schottky contact, and 
(e) lift-off the photoresist (PR) by acetone. The 
dimension of the gate pattern was 1×100 μm2. 
The schematic cross section of the studied 
Al0.24Ga0.76As/In0.15Ga0.85As PHEMT is 
depicted in Fig. 1 (a). The scanning electron 
microscopic (SEM) images of top-view 
photograph of the EP film on the Al0.24Ga0.76As 
layer is shown in Fig.1 (b). 
As listed in Table I, a hydrazine-based 
plating bath was used in this work. In this bath, 
PdCl2 was used as the palladium precursor, 
N2H4 as the reducing agent, and ammonia 
water as the pH buffer. A small amount of 
 4
+1.2 V and is negligible at VGS = 0. Before the 
deposition of Pd film, the AlGaAs Schottky 
layer is inherently partly etched by the alkaline 
EP solution. The gate to channel distance is 
adjusted by appropriate EP deposition 
conditions. This causes the device threshold up 
to full depletion at zero gate bias. Therefore, 
the remarkable E-mode characteristic of device 
B can be obtained. 
Figure 4 shows the transconductance (gm) 
and IDS of devices A and B versus VGS at room 
temperature. The bias voltage is fixed at VDS = 
3 V. The maximum extrinsic transconductance 
(gm,max) and the maximum drain-source 
saturation current (IDS,max) values are 225.8 
mS/mm and 168.9 mA/mm for device A 
(D-mode). The corresponding values are 211.7 
mS/mm and 152.5 mA/mm for device B 
(E-mode). Clearly, the proposed D- and 
E-mode PHEMTs demonstrate good current 
driving capability and high extrinsic 
transconductance. 
For the microwave characteristics, the 
unity current gain cutoff frequency fT and 
maximum oscillation frequency fmax of the 
device A (D-mode) are 19.9 and 33.9 GHz at 
VDS = 3 V and VGS = +0.6 V. The 
corresponding maximum fT and fmax of device B 
(E-mode) are 17.8 and 28.5 GHz. This result is 
comparable to double-heterojunction HEMT 
[14] and better than the reported δ-PHEMT [6]. 
The device A maintains 80% of fT and fmax peak 
values over VGS operation regimes of 0.62 V at 
300K.  
Experimentally, the EP Pd layer is 
regularly stacked by Pd grains with the typical 
size of 25 nm as shown in Fig. 1 (b) which may 
be the theoretical limitation of gate length. 
However, the sensitization and activation are 
used for substrates prior to the metal deposition. 
In the case of EP Pd in an alkaline hydrazine 
bath, palladium chloride solution (PdCl2) and 
stannous chloride solution (SnCl2) are widely 
employed for deposition seeds onto the 
substrate surface [15]. The Pd grain size can be 
reduced using the method and thus applied to a 
relatively short gate length. 
Figure 5 shows the common source I-V 
characteristics of the studied devices A(EP) and 
B(TE) at room temperature. The gate-source 
voltage (VGS) is applied by -0.3 V per step. 
Both studied devices show good pinch-off and 
saturation characteristics at different 
temperatures due to good carrier confinement 
and reduction of gate leakage current. 
Especially, under the bias condition of VGS = 0 
V, the available drain-source saturation current 
(IDSS = 41 mA/mm) of device A is lower than 
that (61 mA/mm) of device B at 300K. This is 
caused by the substantial increase of a gate 
depletion region and potential energy, ΔV, 
which is resulted from the enhanced ΦB of the 
EP deposition approach for Schottky contact. 
Figure 6 illustrates the measured 
gate-drain current-voltage (I-V) characteristics 
of studied device A(EP) at different 
temperatures. The turn-on voltage (Von) is 
measured under the gate current of 1 mA/mm. 
The Von is decreased from 0.75 to 0.51 V as the 
temperature is elevated from 300 to 500 K. 
Clearly, the studied device demonstrates high 
values of Von which allows larger induced 
currents in the channel under the applied 
forward gate biases. This certainly causes the 
enhancement of output power capability. The 
corresponding gate current (IG) is increased 
from 3.9 to 161.4 μA/mm as the temperature is 
elevated from 300 to 500 K at the gate-drain 
voltage of VGD = -15 V. Even at high 
temperature, the IG is still lower than 1 mA/mm 
(the definition of the breakdown voltage BVGD). 
This means that the gate-drain breakdown 
voltage BVGD is higher than 15 V. In addition, 
the variations of Von (△Von) and IG (△IG) from 
300 to 500 K are 0.24 V and 157.5 μA for the 
studied device A (EP). The related temperature 
coefficients of Von (∂Von/∂T) and IG (∂IG/∂T) of 
the studied device A(EP) are -1.25 mV/K and 
0.7 μA/mm·K. It is found that the studied 
device shows lower variations and temperature 
coefficients of Von and IG as compared with 
previously reported PHEMTs [16]. Thus, based 
 6
temperature is increased from 300 to 500 K. 
Therefore, these advantages provide the 
promise for high-speed and high-temperature 
electronics applications. Furthermore, the EP 
deposition approach demonstrates the 
advantages of simple apparatus, easy operation, 
low cost, and IC industry compatibility.

pined at a constant value and nearly 
independent of the metal work function. This 
phenomenon is called the Fermi level pinning 
effect at metal-semiconductor interfaces (M-S) 
[5]. Many approaches have been reported to 
overcome this drawback, e.g., a thin interfacial 
oxide at M-S interfaces [6, 7], sulfur or 
selenium surface treatments [8, 9], and the 
modification of the surface properties by 
plasma treatments [10, 11]. However, these 
Schottky barriers suffer from instability and 
poor reproducibility due to complex interfacial 
reactions. By considering the role of 
electrochemical deposition in passivating the 
Schottky interface, a new deposition approach, 
i.e., the electroless plating (EP) is employed in 
this work to fabricate a high-performance M-S 
interface. Based on the inherent 
low-temperature and low-energy characteristics, 
the EP deposition approach facilitates the 
formation of a well-behaved Schottky interface 
with less Fermi-level pinning effect for 
superior electric rectifying properties [12, 13]. 
Furthermore, the EP deposition approach has 
the advantages of low cost, simplified process, 
simple apparatus, and highly promising for use 
in the IC industry. The EP deposition approach 
has been applied towards Schottky diodes, 
which exhibit better electric characteristics than 
thermal evaporation (TE) does [14, 15]. 
Therefore, the metal gate can be deposited on 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pseudomorphic high 
electron mobility transistor (PHEMT) by using 
the EP deposition approach. The 
well-formation Schottky interface is highly 
promising for enhancing the characteristics of 
the studied device. 
 
四、研究方法 
The epitaxial layers of the studied device 
were grown on a GaAs (100) semi-insulating 
(S.I.) substrate by a metal organic chemical 
vapor deposition (MOCVD) system. From the 
substrate up, the buffer structure consisted of a 
6000 Å GaAs buffer layer, a 150 Å undoped 
In0.15Ga0.85As strained channel, a 50 Å undoped 
Al0.24Ga0.76As spacer layer, a Si planar-doped 
sheet with a doping concentration of δ(n+) = 
3x1012 cm-2 as a carrier supplier layer, and a 
200 Å n-Al0.24Ga0.76As (n = 3x1017cm-3) 
Schottky contact layer. The cap layer is 50 Å 
undoped GaAs. First, mesa isolations were 
done by wet chemical etching. After mesa 
isolation, the drain-source Ohmic contacts were 
formed, using the conventional 
photolithography, on 50 Å undoped GaAs cap 
layer by alloying AuGe/Au metal at 340 oC for 
40 s. Gate recess etching of 50 Å undoped 
GaAs cap layer was done by an H3PO4: H2O2: 
H2O (1:1:50) solution at room temperature. The 
Pd gate Schottky contact was achieved by EP 
or TE deposition on the n+-Al0.24Ga0.76As 
Schottky contact layer. The operation processes 
of EP approach are explained as follows: (a) 
surface pretreatment; (b) pattern transferred by 
photolithography; (c) hard-baked on hot-plate 
at 90 °C for 30 min; (d) immersing the sample 
in an EP bath for depositing Pd film as the 
Schottky contact. (The composition of Pd EP 
bath is listed in Table I, and we blend precursor 
and reducing agent solution at the volume ratio 
of 20:1); (e) lift-off the photoresist (PR) by 
acetone, and rinsed by D.I. water, and then 
dried by N2 blow. For comparison, the samples 
prepared by EP (denoted as device A) and TE 
(denoted as device B) were fabricated together 
by using the same process sequence except for 
the deposition approach of the Schottky 
contacts. Figure 1 depicts a schematic cross 
section of the studied device by EP deposition 
approach. The gate dimension of 1×100 μm2 
was used in this work.  
As listed in Table I, a hydrazine-based 
plating bath was used in this work. In this bath, 
PdCl2 was used as the palladium precursor, 
N2H4 as the reducing agent, and ammonia 
water as the pH buffer. Small amount of 
thiourea was added for bath stabilization. The 
complex agent, Na2EDTA, chelating with the 
palladium ions allows the following redox 
reaction appropriately carried out at 300K on 
the surface of the AlGaAs surface.

a function of temperature are illustrated in Fig. 
6. The biased voltage is fixed at VDS = 3 V. The 
Vth of device A (B) is decreased from -0.43 
(-0.57) to -0.61 (-0.62) V as the temperature is 
increased from 300 to 500K. The device B has 
a higher magnitude of Vth. This implies that a 
higher density of defects is produced near the 
interface for device B which results in a 
lowering effect of ΦB [17-19]. Hence the band 
bending of the Pd/AlGaAs Schottky contact 
can then be enhanced via the EP deposition 
approach. The enhanced ΦB of device A 
certainly results in the improvement of Vth. 
Figure 7 shows the maximum 
transconductance gm,max, IDS, and drain current 
operation regime IDS-op (above 90% of gm,max) 
as s function of temperature. The biased 
voltage is fixed at VDS = 3 V. The gm,max values 
of device A (B) are 225.8 (172.5) and 160.9 
(137.9) mS/mm at 300 and 500K, respectively. 
The corresponding IDS are 220.1 (194.1) and 
150.9 (154.9) mA/mm, respectively. The width 
of IDS operating regime is decreased from 104 
(102) to 73 (87) mA/mm for device A (B) as 
the temperature is increased from 300 to 500K. 
As comparing with device B, the device A has 
advantages of higher gm,max and IDS, but 
relatively inferior performance on IDS operation 
regime. Device A exhibits better characteristics 
at room temperature. Yet, with increasing the 
temperature, the degradation rate is higher than 
those of device B. So, the studied device with 
EP deposition approach shows stronger 
temperature dependences. The possible reason 
may originate from the Pd grain size. The 
surface of EP deposition Pd layer looks roughly, 
which is regularly stacked by Pd grains with 
the size dimension from 100 to 200 nm [11]. 
Clearly, as compared with the Pd layer with TE 
deposition, the one with EP deposition is less 
dense. The less dense structure of Pd film may 
exhibit the instability problem at higher 
temperature and lead to higher degradation rate 
of these characteristics. 
Figure 8 shows the gm, output conductance 
gds, and voltage gain AV as a function of 
temperature. The bias voltages are fixed at VDS 
= 3 V and VGS = 0.3 V. The gm of devices A (B) 
is decreased from 207.8 (172.8) to 150.5 (132.8) 
mS/mm as the temperature is elevated from 300 
to 500K. The corresponding gds of device A (B) 
is increased from 0.44 (0.57) to 2.61 (2.60) 
mS/mm. Thus, the voltage gain AV (gm/gds) of 
device A (B) is decreased from 468 (303) to 
57.6 (51.1) as the temperature is increased from 
300 to 500 K. Obviously, due to the improved 
gate Schottky characteristics and reduced 
leakage currents, the relatively higher gm and 
lower gds of device A are obtained. Hence, a 
higher AV is obtained for device A. 
The microwave characteristics of device A 
at room temperature are shown in Fig. 9. The 
inset shows the unity current gain cutoff 
frequency fT and maximum oscillation 
frequency fmax versus VGS of devices A and B. 
The bias voltage is fixed at VDS = 3 V. The fT 
and fmax of the device A (B) extrapolated from 
the maximum available gain (MAG) are 20.1 
(24.2) and 36.8 (50.1) GHz at VDS = 3 V and 
VGS = +0.9 (+0.6) V.

二、英文摘要 
An interesting GaAs based pseudomorphic 
transistor with an electroless-plated (EP) 
surface treated gate is fabricated and studied. 
Based on the low-temperature and low-energy 
electrochemical deposition conditions, the EP 
deposition approach can form better 
metal-semiconductor (M-S) interface with the 
reduction in surface thermal damages and 
disordered-states. The material analyses of EP 
deposition approach, including Auger electron 
spectroscopy (AES), scanning electron 
microscopic (SEM), and atomic force 
microscopy (AFM), are examined. The device 
characteristics including DC, microwave and 
reliability performance are investigated. In 
addition, the temperature influences of the 
studied devices, at the temperature regime of 
300 to 500K, are studied. As compared with the 
conventional thermal evaporation (TE) 
approach, the EP-based device shows 
significantly improved DC characteristics over 
a wide temperature range (300-500K). 
Moreover, the EP approach also has the 
advantages of easy operation and low cost. 
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
For the compound semiconductor material 
systems used in the electronic and 
optoelectronic circuits, the Schottky contact 
plays an important role in the performance of 
their resultant devices [1, 2]. During the 
fabrication process without well-controlled 
parameters, the Schottky contact properties on 
the barrier layer are usually dominated by the 
disorder-induced gap state (DIGS) effect [3]. In 
the conventional physical vacuum deposition 
processes, e.g., thermal evaporation (TE), 
sputtering, and e-gun evaporation, the 
high-temperature and high-energy evaporated 
sources would cause the surface damages, 
disorder on the surface of the semiconductor 
and result in the extrinsic Fermi level pinning 
 20
(denoted as device B) were fabricated together 
by using the same process sequence except for 
the deposition approach of the Schottky 
contacts. The dimension of the gate pattern was 
1×100 μm2. 
As listed in Table I, a hydrazine-based 
plating bath was used in this work. The used 
alkaline EP bath solution contained palladium 
precursor (PdCl2), complex agent (NH4OH) 
and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 
stabilizer (thiourea), and reductant (N2H4) [8]. 
In alkaline EP bath solution, the PdCl2 was 
used as the Pd precursor for providing the Pd 
ion and the NH4OH was applied as complex 
agent and buffer solution. Moreover, the PdCl2 
and NH4OH were combined to form 
[Pd(NH3)42+] complex to stabilize free Pd ions 
in alkaline EP bath. It not only prevents Pd ions 
from spontaneously precipitation, but also 
maintains the desired pH value of alkaline EP 
bath. On the other hand, based on the 
combination of complex agent EDTA and 
[Pd(NH3)42+], the [PdEDTA] complex could be 
formed accordingly. It is noteworthy that the 
EDTA acts as a chelating agent so that the free 
Pd ions could be chelated. This will effectively 
prevent the free Pd ions from homogeneous 
decomposition in the alkaline EP bath. In 
addition, the thiourea was used as a stabilizer to 
stabilize free Pd ions and prevent the bath 
solution from homogeneous decomposition. 
The detailed process is listed below. PdCl2 
(0.0675 g), NH4OH (2.4375 ml), Na2EDTA 
(0.4375 g), thiourea (0.03125 ml), and 
deionized water were respectively added into 
the beaker with a capacity of 100 ml. N2H4 (0.2 
ml) and deionized water (20 ml) were added 
into another beaker. The precursor and reducing 
agent solution at the volume ratio of 20:1 are 
blended at 30℃. The pH value of alkaline 
system is between 10-11. The related redox 
reaction is shown as [5]: 
 
2Pd2+(aq) + N2H4(aq) + 4OH-(aq) 
 
                                    (1) 
五、實驗結果與討論 
Figures 2 (a) and (b) show the Auger 
electron spectroscopy (AES) depth profile 
analyses of devices A and B, respectively. The 
significant difference between these two figures 
is the presence of oxygen atoms at the 
Pd/AlGaAs interfaces. Due to the exposure of 
AlGaAs Schottky barrier layer, after cap layer 
etching process, the native oxide layer easily 
formed on AlGaAs surface. This is the main 
reason of the existence of oxygen atoms in 
device B (TE-gate). The native oxide of 
AlGaAs surface may be the cause of surface 
defects and problems related to stability [9, 10]. 
The poor surface properties result in the 
undesired Fermi level pinning effect and 
increased leakage current. It brings about the 
poor Schottky contact characteristics. However, 
due to the weak alkaline property of EP bath, 
the native oxide layer can be removed before 
the deposition of the Pd film. The removal of 
group III and V-oxides by alkaline solutions did 
not form other compound or oxide [10]. Hence, 
the improved device performance of device A 
(EP-gate) is expected. 
Figures 3 show SEM images of the Pd 
film on the AlGaAs layer of devices A and B at 
300 and 500K, respectively. Experimentally, 
the Pd film of device A (EP-gate) is regularly 
stacked by Pd grains. Clearly, as compared with 
the Pd film with device B (TE-gate), the one 
with EP deposition is less dense. The less dense 
structure of Pd film may exhibit the instability 
problem at higher temperature and lead to 
higher degradation rate of these characteristics. 
After measured at 500K, as compared with 
device B, the Pd grain size of device A is 
significantly increased as shown in Fig. 3 (c). It 
is referred that the expansion of Pd grain is 
resulted from sintering of Pd grains under a 
high temperature operation. 
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
images of surface roughness of EP and TE Pd 
metals are displayed in Figs. 4 (a) and (b). The 
root mean square (RMS) value is 5.6 nm for the 
EP Pd metal. As compared with TE Pd metal 
Na2EDTA 
Thiourea 2Pd(s) + N2(g) + 4H2O(l)
 22
is increased from 0.44 to 2.61 mS/mm as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 500 K. 
The corresponding gm is decreased from 207.8 
to 150.5 mS/mm. Therefore, the related AV is 
decreased from 468 to 57.6. Obviously, the 
high gm and low gds of the studied device A 
(EP-gate) can be obtained due to reduction of 
the leakage current associated with 
well-qualified Schottky interface and enhanced 
breakdown characteristics. Hence, a high AV 
can be obtained. The enhanced characteristics 
give the promise of EP device for 
high-performance electronics applications. 
The long-term stability of the EP-based 
device was investigated based on the biased 
accelerated life tests at three different 
temperatures. During the stress, the EP-based 
devices are continuously biased under 
conditions of VDS = 4 V and periodically 
measured. The degradation of important 
electrical parameters include the IDS, gm,max, and 
Vth. The degradation of normalized IDS, gm,max, 
and Vth on the stress time, for the studied 
device A (EP-gate), after a biased stress test of 
VDS = 4.0 V at Tambient 420, 450, and 480K, 
are shown in Figs. 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c). The 
studied device A (EP-gate) exhibits the 
decrease magnitudes of IDS about 14.8, 18.8, 
24.1 % at 420, 450, and 480K, respectively. 
After 144 hr of stress test, gm,max values of the 
studied device A (EP-gate) drop 9.9, 16.9, 24.2 
% from its initial value at 420, 450, and 480K, 
respectively. The corresponding Vth variations 
are 23.1, 24.8, 26.4 % at 420, 450, and 480K, 
respectively. From these experimental results, 
the speculation on the two degradation 
mechanisms is proposed in the following. The 
first mechanism is the self-heating effect (SHE) 
[17]. The heat generation is caused by the 
energy transferred from the hot electrons to the 
channel. The low-field mobility and saturation 
velocity of the carriers in 2DEG are decreased 
due to the increasing phonon scattering 
processes [18]. This leads to a reduction of ID 
and gm [17, 19]. The second mechanism is the 
gate sinking [20]. The gate metal diffuses into 
the semiconductor due to the thermal activation. 
This results in a decrease of the distance 
between the metal-semiconductor interface and 
the active channel. The decrease of the gate to 
channel distance causes a positive shift of the 
threshold voltage [20, 21]. 
The ID cumulative errors versus stress 
time of the studied devices, at different 
temperatures of 420, 450, and 480K, are 
depicted in Fig. 9. The stress bias voltage is 
kept at VDS = 4 V, and ID is extracted from the 
bias condition of VGS = +0.6 V and VDS = 3 V. 
Based on a 20% degradation of ID failure 
criterion, the median lifetimes were calculated. 
The median time to failure (MTTF) values of 
the studied device A (B) at 420, 450, and 480K 
are 774.9 (1287.2), 199.3 (296.1), and 61.5 
(99.1) hours, respectively. Usually, the device 
reliability performance could be expressed as

  ln(MTTF) a +=                 (2) 
where Ea is the activation energy and A the 
constant. Figure 10 shows the MTTF versus the 
reciprocal of the channel temperature of the 
studied devices. It is known that, from Fig. 10, 
for the studied device A (B), the MTTF of 6.5 × 
106 (1.2 × 107) hours, at T = 398K and Ea = 
1.18 (1.19) eV, is obtained. From the 
experiment results, device A is slightly less 
reliability than device B. The possible reason 
may originate from the Pd grain size. Thus, the 
studied device with EP deposition approach 
shows stronger temperature dependences. 
However, as compared with other previous 
reported HEMTs [23-25], the studied EP device 
still has good potential in high-reliability circuit 
applications.
