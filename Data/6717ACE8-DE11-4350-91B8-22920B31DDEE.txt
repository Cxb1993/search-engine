Abstract 
 Recently, the emerging of broadband 
wireless access network (BWAN) technology 
and the program M-Taiwan propelling by the 
government makes Taipei has become the 
greatest covered by public wireless broad-
band networks. Meanwhile, with the internet 
protocol television (IPTV) and worldwide 
interoperability for microwave access (Wi-
MAX) showing up, it achieves the new TV 
broadcasting age coming. Therefore, coming 
with the trend, the plan in this year will focus 
on how to reduce the capacity of receiving 
buffer and enhance the broadcasting effi-
ciency in IPTV transmitting for subscribers 
in WiMAX systems. Accordingly, we design 
a remainder arrangement broadcasting (RAB) 
to reduce the original required capacity of 
buffers. What is more, facing how to shorten 
the waiting time for playing video, we also 
improve on RAB method and name it hy-
brid-RAB (HRAB). We will compare our 
methods with some famous broadcasting 
method, ex. the reverse fast broadcasting 
(RFB) and division-base broadcasting (DBB). 
The results shows the relative required buff-
ers are under 10%, and the relative waiting 
time shortening much than others. In addi-
tional, we also design a connection admission 
control (CAC) mechanism based on standard 
variation to control connections for guaran-
teeing the quality of connected connections. 
Meanwhile, we also consider the uplink 
channels in subscribers – how to allocate re-
sources to achieve guaranteed qualities. 
 
2. The Motivations and Goals 
The IPTV [1] broadcasting system is 
In order to service all subscribers, the 
data rate of each channel is transmitted in the 
basic rate denoted as Db and the total needed 
bandwidth for broadcasting the video film is 
kDb. Assume each subscriber needs a video 
playing rate Pr to play a video and it satisfies 
the condition Pr≤Db, which means that the 
download rate should be faster than the play 
rate so that the subscriber can obtain enough 
data for process. This proposition is called 
the playback ratio α and is given by

3.1. IPTV Broadcasting Buffer Reducing 
3.1.1. Proposed Schemes 
These two virtual IPTV channels are 
constructed by OFDMA burst that also inter-
pret IPTV burst's information at DL-MAP. In 
this system, only two channels are used with 
the lowest transmission modulation for ser-
vicing most subscribers. Db uses QPSK-1/2 
modulation's transmission rate in WiMAX. 
For example, QPSK-1/2's data rate ~ 3 Mbps; 
a MPEG1-encoded playback rate ~ 1 Mbps, 
⎣ ⎦ 3=α  Mbps/1 Mbps = 3. ⎣ ⎦α  as integer 
and larger than 1. By this method the leftover 
data in the buffer can be broadcasted when 
MSS is under interference with abnormal 
video playback or processing handover. The 
buffering requirement can be greatly reduced 
after adding RFB, but segments will still 
continue to download. However the waiting 
time is still too long for subscriber with a 
single channel in wireless. Therefore, the 
RAB and the HRAB are proposed to the 
problems of buffer requirement and waiting 
time. 
3.1.2. RAB Scheme 
By using the playback ratio and the or-
der on each channel, the order of a broad-
casting period can be recalculated. At the ini-
tiation process , is arranged 
according to the segment number in the 
broadcasting period. The server will know 
the rate of video playback and the smallest 
rate of transmission in the system, so the
1]-N [1,i,Sij ∈
⎣ ⎦α , 
N and m can be calculated. The location of Sij 
in broadcasting period is L(Sij), and we know 
the required buffer to play out more than the 
playing and downloading the film at the same 
time The minimized required-buffer can be 
achieved as the different time between Sij and 
S(i+1)j. Therefore, we an re-arrange L(Sij) 
within broadcasting period to have the 
⎣ ⎦α Td intervals between both Sij and S(i+1)j , 
it can be calculated as 
⎣ ⎦ m. ))modL(S()L(S ij1)j(i +=+ α , 
and its algorithm shows in Fig. 2 and 3.

Fig 3. An illustration of segment downloading of RAB when 
m = 4. 
3.1.3. HRAB Scheme 
On a normal proactive method, the 
server will frequently broadcast segment S00 
at channel 0. This way, subscribers can re-
ceive the first segment anytime after entering 
the system. The largest waiting time is equal 
to the transmission time of a segment Td, and 
the average waiting time is half of Td. The 
length of the waiting time is determined by 
the number of the segments and the data rate 
of transmission Td = |Si|/Db. In the proposed 
scheme, the number of segments is small be-

3.2.1. Proposed Schemes 
The purpose of CAC is to limit the 
number of connections in the network if all 
of the bandwidth has been used up to provide 
the highest QoS to existing users. Thus, a 
resource reservation with QoS constraints is 
considered, suppose that there are B band-
width in a frame time, and we set four ser-
vice types UGS, rtPS, nrtPS, and BE with 
different thresholds such that, 
BTTTT BEnrtPSrtPSUGX =+++  
Furthermore, the state space of the 
amount of connections is }{ (x)Ni0i C ≤≤= , 
where i denote the number of ongoing con-
nections for a specific service type. Also, the 
transition matrix of Markov chain is obtained 
as follows, 
 
Once these four thresholds TUGS, TrtPS, 
TnrtPS, and TBE are determined by adminis-
trator, the CAC could be implemented in 
two-phase algorithm mentioned in Fig. 8 and 
Fig. 9. Note that the two-phase CAC algo-
rithm should be invoked frame by frame. 
Phase-1 is for admission of new connections, 
and phase-2 is used to provide QoS for on-
going connections. The two-phase CAC al-
gorithm is described in detail as follows.

3.3.1. Proposed Schemes 
Let us extend the Hall’s theorem and 
apply it to a problem that is how to enhance 
the system capacity. We consider sub-chan-
nels as X and SSs as Y. The matching of X 
and Y is totally like assigning sub-channel to 
SS. According to the Hall’s marriage theo-
rem, we can easily know that there exist a 
complete matching of X into Y if and only if 
is satisfiedXA ⊆∀ R(A)A ≤ , 
which { }{ }.Eyx,A,xYyR(A) ∈∈∃∈= On 
the other word, there exist a maximum utili-
zation of capacity of sub-channel into SS if 
is satisfied subchannelA ⊆∀ R(A)A ≤ , 
which { }{ }Eyx,,subchannelxSSyR(A) ∈∈∃∈= , 
where E here implies an assignment of a 
sub-channel to a SS. Once the condition de-
scribed above is set up, we will get the objec-
tive which is maximum capacity enhance-
ment. However, there still has a question 
which is how to find a match function R that 
makes the condition always be true? This 
question can also be described as how to al-
locate all sub-channels to each SSs with low-
ering bit error rate. Thus, we propose a algo-
rithm to solve this problem. The detail of the 
algorithm is described later.

ABSTRACT
The network simulator 2 (ns-2) is a popular and powerful
simulation tool for the simulation of packet-switched net-
works, which provides substantial support for simulation
of TCP, routing, and MAC protocols over wired and wire-
less networks, such as wireless LANs, mobile ad hoc net-
works (MANETs), and satellite communications, etc, and is
widely used in both academia and industry. Although many
protocol modules have been implemented in the ns-2, the
IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access networks (BWANs)
or WiMAX module has not been contributed yet. Thus, in
this paper, we present our detailed design and implementa-
tion of the WiMAX module based on the IEEE 802.16 stan-
dard with the point-to-multipoint (PMP) mode for the ns-2.
The implemented module comprises fundamental functions
of the service-specific convergence sublayer (CS), the MAC
common part sublayer (CPS), and the PHY layer. A simple
call admission control (CAC) mechanism and the scheduler
are also included in this module.

1. INTRODUCTION
Broadband wireless access (BWA) has been receiving much
more attentions recently [6, 7, 10]. Since the number of
wireless network devices will soon surpass the number of
wired network devices, research into wireless networks is be-
ing more recognized. Fixed BWA systems, such as the local
∗Correspondence should be addressed to J. Chen (e-mail:

multipoint distribution service (LMDS), provide multime-
dia services to a number of discrete subscriber sites with
IP and offer numerous advantages over wired IP networks.
This is accomplished by using base stations (BSs) to pro-
vide network access services to subscriber sites based on
the IEEE 802.16 WirelessMAN standard. First published
in April 2002, IEEE 802.16 standard has recently been up-
dated to IEEE 802.16-2004 [1] (approved in June 2004). The
standard focuses on the “first-mile/last-mile” connection in
wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) [5].
Its purpose is to facilitate the optimal use of bandwidth 2–
66 GHz as well as the interoperability among devices from
different vendors. Typical channel bandwidth allocations
are 20 or 25 MHz (United Stats) or 28 MHz (Europe) in
10–66 GHz, or various channel bandwidths among 1 to 30
MHz in 2–11 GHz [2]. The progress of the standard has
been fostered by the keen interest of the wireless broadband
industry to capture the emerging WiMAX (worldwide in-
teroperability for microwave access) market; the next-wave
wireless market that aims to provide wireless broadband ac-
cess services. IEEE 802.16 is the current trends on WiMAX.
The WiMAX Forum, formed in 2003, is promoting the com-
mercialization of IEEE 802.16 and the European Telecom-
munications Standard Institute’s (ETSI’s) high performance
radio MANs (HyperMANs). It provides one of potential so-
lutions to B3G/4G architecture.
The IEEE 802.16 standard defines the specifications re-
lated to the service-specific convergence sublayer (CS), the
MAC common part sublayer (CPS), the security sublayer,
and the PHY layer. The MAC management messages, such
as the ranging request/response (RNG-REQ/RNG-RSP),
the downlink/uplink channel descriptor (DCD/UCD), the
downlink/uplink map (DL-MAP/UL-MAP), and so forth
are implemented to operate the WiMAX networks. All oper-
ations between the base station (BS) and subscriber stations
(SSs) over a superframe interval follow the compulsory pro-
cedures of the 802.16 standard. The detailed descriptions of
IEEE 802.16 can be found in [1, 2, 3].
The most popular network simulator used by the academia
and industry is the network simulator 2 (ns-2) [11], which
has become the de facto standard for the simulation of packet-
switched networks. Specifically, more and more published
network studies and investigations take ns-2 as their evalu-
ation tool to verify their work. Although there is another
force that investigates the IEEE 802.16-based simulator [8],

does not define the admission control process. All packets
from the application layer are classified by the connection
classifier based on the CID and are forwarded to the ap-
propriate queue. At the SS, the scheduler will retrieve the
packets from the queues and transmit them to the network
in the appropriate time slots as defined by the UL-MAP
sent by the BS. The UL-MAP is determined by the scheduler
module based on the BW-request messages. These messages
report the current queue size of each connection in SS.
3. THE IEEE 802.16 NS-2 MODULE
The developed 802.16-based WiMAX module named as
the Mac802 16 class is in accordance with the specifications
of the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard [1] and based on the ns-2
version 2.29 [11]. All modules are designed by using object-
oriented programming language C++ and modeled as sev-
eral classes. The relationship between the WiMAX module
and legacy ns-2 modules is based on the original network
component stack of the ns-2 as shown in Fig 2. It illustrates
the type of objects for the traffic generating agent (TGA),
the link layer (LL), the interface queue (IFQ), the designed
MAC layer (WiMAX module), and the PHY layer (Chan-
nel).
First, the TGA is considered simply as an application level
traffic generator that generates VoIP, MPEG, FTP, HTTP
traffic, and so on. These traffic are classified into five differ-
ent types of service, the UGS, rtPS, ertPS, nrtPS, and BE,
each with its own priority. All packets will be transferred
to different types of priority queues according to their ser-
vice types by using CS layer SFID-CID mapping mechanism.
The data packets in these queues are treated as MSDUs and
will be selected to pass into the WiMAX module in a round
robin manner.
While the WiMAX module in the SS receives the MSDUs
from the Queue object, the MAC management component
will initiate the ranging process to enter the WiMAX system
or to transmit the MSDUs according to the scheduled time
obtained from UL-MAP. Once the process has been success-
fully finished in the MAC layer, the Network Interface will
add a propagation delay and broadcast in the air interface.
The Channel object we used is the WirelessPhy class.
The WiMAX module also receives packets from the air

unsuccessful transmission, the CWmin is doubled up to a
maximum value CWmax = 2
mCWmin. The CWmax value is
set to 1024 as defined in the standard. The SS uses CID
value of zero to send RNG-REQ and starts a timer to wait
for the RNG-RSP message from the BS. These processes are
operated in two functions rng req() and rng rsp().
If the SS receives the RNG-RSP before the timer expira-
tion, the ranging process is successful. Otherwise, the SS
will select a new backoff window size for a new ranging pro-
cess. The collision detection of the RNG-REQ is set by the
receiver timer. If more than one RNG-REQ message is sent
within the time interval, these RNG-REQs are treated as
collision. Otherwise, this message is successful. When the
BS receives a RNG-REQ message from the SS, it will decide
to let the SS join the networks or not. After determination,
the BS will reply a RNG-RSP message following the DL-
or engineers can design their own Scheduler() function ac-
cording to their specific purposes or usages to substitute for
this one. In addition, the ARQ function is an optional sub-
ject matter and is not implemented in our module.
3.2.5 DL-MAP/UL-MAP
The DL-MAP and UL-MAP are periodically generated
to announce the information of the arrangement of the DL
and UL periods in the superframe. These two messages are
handled by DLmapHandler() and ULmapHandler(). There
are management message types, PHY synchronization field,
DCD count, base station ID, and DL-MAP IEs (IE: infor-
mation element) in the DL-MAP message. The important
part in the DL-MAP are the DL-MAP IE()s, which are com-
posed by the type-length-value (TLV) encoding. Each DL-
MAP IE is generated by DL MAP IE() and each DL-MAP IE
contains the downlink interval usage code (DIUC), the CID,
the number of CIDs assigned for this IE, the OFDMA sym-
bol and subchannel offset, the number of the OFDMA sym-
bols, and the number of the subchannels.
The structure of UL-MAP is similar to the DL-MAP, but
the differences between them are the uplink channel ID and
the allocation start time. The uplink channel ID is the iden-
tifier of the uplink channel to which this message refers. The
allocation start time is the effective start time of the uplink
allocation defined by the UL-MAP. The UL-MAP IE struc-
ture is also similar to the DL-MAP IE. The capability of
the DL-MAP and the UL-MAP will decide the time domain
and the frequency domain in the frame space.
3.2.6 Fragmentation/Packing
The packet fragmentation or packing process is executed
by PDU Generator() function. This function grabs the MS-
DUs from QoS queues (UGS, rtPS, ertPS, nrtPS, and BE)
and produces MPDUs depending on the command of the
Scheduler(). It will generate the generic MAC header for
each data payload. Fragmentation is the process that di-
vides a MSDU into one or more MPDUs. If packing is turned
on for a connection, the MAC may pack multiple MSDUs
into a single MPDU. In this module, the input MSDU will
be fragmented or packed depending on the length of the
MPDU. Due to the reason of simplicity, we set the length
of each MPDU fixed. Once the fragmentation or packing
process is proceeded, the corresponding subheader will also
be given to each MSDU contained in a MPDU.
After data fragmentation and packing, the scheduler will
invoke Transmit Data() for data transmission. The treat-
ment of the transmission will be various depending on whether
it happened in the SS or BS. In the SS, the scheduler con-
catenates the MPDUs into one burst transmission accord-
ing to the arrangement of the UL-MAP. In contrast to SS,
the BS concatenates the MPDUs into one burst transmis-
sion according to the DL-MAP, which is generated by the
scheduler. This function is periodically triggered in each su-
perframe to decide to transmit burst data to/from DL or
UL of the BS or SSs.
The Assembler() function is a process function of defrag-
menting and unpacking received data burst. It will read
the MAC header to see whether this MPDU is fragmented
or packed. Furthermore, the subheaders information such as
FC in MPDU will also be read to recover an original MSDU.
3.2.7 802.16 timer class
The 802.16 Timer class inherits the Handler class with
three important functions:
• The start() is used to trigger the timer to start.
• The stop() is used to stop the timer if the event hap-
pened before expiration.
• The handle() is used to trigger event while time runs
out.
These Timer classes play an important role of the system
such as sequencing the events between the BS and SSs in
WiMAX networks. For instance, each superframe starts
from the DL-MAPTimer and then it triggers the following
timers, UL-MAPTimer, DCDPeriodTimer, and UCDPeriodTimer
iteratively. Another kind of timer is used to count down the
given specific time before the expected time expires or an
event is encountered, e.g., the SS starts a RNG-REQ timer
to wait for the RNG-RSP from the BS. All timer intervals
defined in the WiMAX module are referred to the IEEE
802.16 standard.
