Where f⋅= πω 2 , ''' ωεωε expresses as 
intrinsic loss Dδtan  resulted from the 
polarization loss of the intrinsic silicon 
substrate, and '/ωεσ  expresses as extrinsic 
loss Lδtan  resulted form the finite 
conductivity of silicon substrate. Therefore, 
the shunt conductance G can further divide 
into G’ due to Dδtan  and G’’ due to Lδtan  as 
shown in Fig 1 [11]. From above description, 
four mechanisms contribute to the loss of the 
CPW on the lossy silicon substrate without a 
thin SiO2 buffer layer, including: conductor 
loss; radiation loss; dielectric losses of the 
intrinsic semiconductor Dδtan  and extrinsic 
substrate leakage loss. Following experiment 
will distinguish the last two mechanisms 
responsible for the main part of the measured 
losses. 
 
III. EXPERIMENT DETAILS 
A CPW line fabricated on Float-zone HRS 
p-type with resistivity of ρ =7000 Ω-cm and 
conventional p-type low resistivity silicon 
(LRS) with resistivity of ρ =10 Ω-cm was 
designed at 50Ω with CPW line length 
L=1000 μm, center conductor width S = 60μm 
and the slot width W = 35μm. The thin Al 
electrode with thickness t =2 μm, three times 
larger than the skin depth at 10 GHz, was 
sputtered and patterned. The characterization 
of the CPW was performed after accurate full 
calibration of short-open-load-thru (SOLT) 
process using a vector network analyzer 
HP8510C. Four calibrated scattering 
parameters measured on tested structures are 
obtained and the complex propagation 
constant )()()( fjff βαγ +=  is derived, 
where α is the total attenuation and β is related 
to the wave number [12]. The effective 
dielectric constant )( feffε  is extracted from 
the β. The dielectric constant rε  of silicon, 
extracted from the effective dielectric constant 
)( feffε  by using the conformal mapping 
method, is 11.9±0.1 over the measured 
frequency range. The total attenuation loss 
)( ftα  of CPW line is the sum of the 
conductor loss )( fcα  and dielectric 
loss )( fdα [11], since the radiation loss can be 
ignored when the structure are carefully 
shielded as measuring. In which, the 
conductor loss )( fcα  of CPW line is 
determined by the characteristic impedance Z0 
[11]. Therefore, the dielectric loss )( fdα  of 
CPW line can be calculated by 
)()()( fff ctd ααα −= . The )( fdα  is 
further characterized by approximately 
frequency-dependent loss tangent tan δ by 
using [11]

Where q is filling factor of the substrate. 
Finally, the intrinsic loss Dδtan  and extrinsic 
loss Lδtan  can be separated. 
 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 The conductor loss )( fcα  and 
dielectric loss )( fdα  cause the main part of 
)( ftα  in different resistivity silicon [9]. 
However, the 10 and 7000Ω-cm silicon 
substrate have similar conductor losses, 
therefore )( fdα  increases as decreasing 
resistivities (Fig. 2). For example, the 
attenuation loss occurred in the case of 7000 
Ω-cm is approximately around 0.079 dB/mm 
at 4 GHz, while the attenuation in case of 10 
Ω-cm at 4 GHz is much more of the 7000 
Ω-cm case due to the high substrate leakage 
loss in frequency range of 1-10GHz(Fig. 2(a)). 
This result suggests the behavior of dielectric 
loss is strongly correlated with the 
contribution of Lδtan . The intrinsic loss 
Dδtan  in both cases is almost 0.043 over the 
measured frequency range (Fig. 2(b)). By 
clearly observed in measured result, indicating 
a high sensitivity of the stopband behavior 
with 4.56 dB/GHz attenuation slope.  
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We have discussed the loss characteristic 
of silicon substrate with different resistivities. 
The dielectric losses are theoretically divided 
into intrinsic semiconductor loss Dδtan  and 
extrinsic substrate leakage loss Lδtan . The 
intrinsic loss Dδtan  is almost 0.043 over the 
measured frequency range. The cut off 
frequencies of different HRS for passive 
devices design consideration are higher than 
those for the substrate noise consideration.
