In addition to being used for prototyping, MPW can be even used directly for low volume 
production. According to 2003 annual report of IMEC [5], IMEC carried out 91 low volume 
projects which produce totally 4.1 million components. This amounts to 45,000 components per 
project. With ever increasing mask tooling cost for more advanced technology, MPW is becoming 
more viable even for medium volume production. As production volume increases, wafer 
fabrication cost takes a considerable portion of the total fabrication cost of a shuttle run. It is 
utmost important to use as few wafers as possible for a shuttle run.

三、研究目的  
 
In this project, we propose a methodology for exploring reticle floorplan design space to 
minimize MPW fabrication cost for low to medium volume production.  
 
四、文獻探討 
 
Much work on reticle floorplanning and wafer dicing [3,4,6-14] has been proposed to minimize 
the number of wafers used. Although no study shows that a minimum use of wafers corresponds 
to a minimum production cost, it is commonly believed that this is true. The production cost of a 
shuttle run consists of wafer fabrication cost and mask cost. Wafer fabrication cost is further

Once we find a lowest cost MPW solution for all the projects that participate in a shuttle run, 
we can compare each of their costs to the cost incurred by each project if it were fabricated alone. 
In this way, we know whether a project is worthwhile of going fabrication using MPW. An 
integrated tool that combines the floorplanner, wafer dicing methods, and MPW cost calculator 
has been implemented to facilitate design space exploration. More detailed descriptions including 
our cost models are given in the paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science 
and Engineering. 
 
六、結果與討論 
 
The experimental results show that our methodology often achieves a double-digit saving in 
MPW fabrication cost. This is shown in Fig. 2. Fig 3. shows the extent that MPW can be used to 
fabricate a project that wants to have a volume production. The cut off volume depends on all the 
projects that participate in the same shuttle run. If more project have large production volume 
requirement, their cutoff volume will be higher. More detailed results are given in our paper 
submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.  
Although fewer wafers, smaller number of exposures, and larger one wafer dicing yield 
often correspond to a lower fabrication cost, we strongly suggest that a reticle design space 
exploration should be conducted to attain a lowest fabrication cost. This can be done within half 
an hour on a 2.4 GHz AMD K8 CPU with 2GB memory.

八、計畫成果自評 
 
The proposed methodology is very effective. It can be readily used by a design service company 
or a foundry to minimize MPW fabrication cost and to offer its customers a lowest cost chip 
fabrication program. The research results were published on ISCAS’05, ASPDAC’06, and 
VLSIDAT’06 (see 附錄). A journal version of the research results is submitted to IEEE 
Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.
