Abstract 
The goal of rate control is mainly to make 
bits stream of videos match the bandwidth of 
the transmission or the size of storage space. 
Meanwhile, reconstructed image quality is also 
considered by rate control. For achieving above 
goals, many rate-control schemes based on the 
rate-distortion (R-D) model have been 
developed. In the project we propose a new 
macroblock-layer rate-control scheme. Through 
the nonlinear regression, the scheme builds 
several nonlinear functions to fit the contents of 
a dynamic table which includes the information 
of rate-distortion, the coefficient distributions 
of blocks and coding way of system for largely 
reducing the need of memories. The new 
rate-control scheme is based on H264/AVC and 
compared with the version JM9.5 of 
H264/AVC. Simulation results show that the 
proposed algorithm achieves a PSNR 
improvement of 0.53dB and better rate control.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In standard video coding systems, the rate 
control plays a very important role because it 
affects the quality of coded videos and the 
match between the compressed bitstream and 
the bandwidth available. Therefore, all the 
video coding standards usually recommend 
their own rate-control schemes, such as TM8 
for H.263 [1] and VM8 for MPEG-4 [2].  
According to the transmission style, the 
rate-control schemes can be classified into two 
major categories: constant-bit-rate (CBR) control [3] 
for the constant bandwidth and variable-bit-rate 
(VBR) control [4]-[9] for the variable bandwidth. 
On the operation style, the rate-control schemes can 
be classified into macroblock- (MB), slice-, or 
frame-layer rate control. Given a frame rate and a 
channel rate, the frame-layer rate control is 
responsible for allocating bits for each video frame. 
Given the budget bits of a frame, the 
macroblock-layer rate control is responsible for 
allocating bits for each macroblock in the frame. 
The macroblock-layer rate control regulates QP to 
control the number of coded bits of each MB for the 
match between its budget bits and coded bits. 
In the process of encoding a video, its distortion 
and the number of coding bits depend on the size of 
QP. Therefore, how to build an accurate relation 
among QP, coding bits and rate distortion has been 
proposed in many papers [1]-[9]. The relation is 
known as rate-distortion model. However, the 
existing rate-control schemes based on R-D models 
suffer from the following (at least parts of) 
drawbacks pointed out by [6], such as inaccurate 
assumption on source statistics and the variances of 
MBs hard to be implemented in the real encoder 
system. For improving these drawbacks, we 
proposed a rate control scheme [6] that uses a 
dynamic rate table instead of R-D function. But, in 
that research we observed that blocks with same 
complexity measured by sum of absolute 
difference (SAD) may result in different 
numbers of coding bits using the same QP to 
quantize them. This is a serious problem for rate 
control because it is hard to control coding bits of 
these blocks. The main cause is from the different 
distributions of the coefficients of those blocks. 
So, for obtaining accurate rate control, the factor of 
distributions of the coefficients of blocks must 
be considered. Though the modified dynamic table 
[8] is built for solving above problem, there is still a 
problem of needing a larger memory for the storage

where 
    x : QP value ( ) 51,,0L=x
 Y : budget bits of a block 
ε : correction value 
Because storing parameters and representative 
blocks still need a lot of memory, it is 
necessary to further reduce the space. 
Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the 
distributions of 0β and 1β in the table [8] for 
the different ranges of SAD, respectively. It is 
apparent that the oscillation of curves is very 
smooth in Figure 1 and Figure 3, which can be 
approximated by nonlinear functions.

where and are the estimations of 0βˆ 1ˆβ 0β and 
1β in Equation (1) and (2), respectively, 
constants a1, a2, b1 and b2 are computed by 
statistical method, and the variable x is for SAD. 
For 19 < SAD < 557, it is hard to estimate 
parameter 0β  which has a large oscillation, so 
we still need a small dynamic table to record 
0β  data. In summary, for SAD is less than 19 
or greater than 557 we use Equation (3) and (4) 
to estimate 0β  and 1β , otherwise,  using 
look-up table to find 0β  and 1β .  
2.2 Rate-Control Algorithm 
Because the first frame of a video sequence 
must be intra frame, its QP is generally set to 
be a constant. So, excluding the first intra 
frame, the rate-control algorithm is summarized 
as follows. 
Frame-Layer Rate Control: 
The part is the same as the version JM9.5 of 
H264/AVC. 
MB-Layer Rate Control: 
1. Input an inter frame. 
2. Set parameter n = 1 for nth MB. 
3. Estimate the complexity (SADn) of nth MB 
by the method of JM9.5. 
4. If SADn ≤19 or SADn 557, then go to 
step 6.
