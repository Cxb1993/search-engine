(1974) and Solaas et al. (1997) adopted the 
perturbation theory to deal with the problem. Over 
the last few years, a fully non-linear theory has been 
developed to obtain reasonable results in simulations 
of large amplitude sloshing; see Chen et al.(1996) 
and Chen et al. (2000). In numerical analysis, the 
finite element method (FEM) is potentially a 
powerful tool and has been widely adopted. For 
example, Ikegawa (1974) used the FEM to analyse 
the sloshing liquid subjected to the one-dimensional 
horizontal ground-level excitation. Nakayam (1980) 
analysed the non-linear sloshing of the liquid in a 
two-dimensional rectangular container subjected to 
pitching excitation. Based on the Navier-Stokes 
equations and the wave equation, Zhou (2007) and 
Mitra (2007) simulated sloshing waves within 
different shaped containers. To reduce computational 
costs, the boundary element method (BEM) has also 
been used for sloshing analyses. Additionally, the 
BEM can easily describe a free surface in motion. 
Faltinsen et al. (1978) and Nakayama et al. (1981) 
adopted the BEM to simulate non-linear sloshing in a 
two-dimensional rectangular container subjected to a 
horizontal excitation. Romero et al. (1995) simulated 
the non-linear sloshing of the Rayleigh-damped fluid 
in a rectangular container subjected to horizontal 
excitations. Chen et al. (2000, 2007) used the BEM 
to study sloshing phenomena in rectangular and 
cylindrical tanks subjected to harmonic and seismic 
excitations. Although the numerical methods 
mentioned above have provided satisfactory and 
useful results, they still exhibit some drawbacks.  
 The FEM and BEM present two major 
drawbacks: elements can be over-distorted, and 
computational accuracy and stability can be heavily 
influenced by the singularity of the fundamental 
solutions. Some meshless numerical methods have 
been proposed to construct approximate solutions 
without dealing with these defects, including the 
method of fundamental solutions (MFS), the 
meshless local Petrove-Galerkin method (MLPG), 
the element-free Galerkin method, and the smooth 
particle hydrodynamics method (SPH). The SPH, 
MLPG, and MFS methods have been used to 
simulate water wave problems by Monaghan  
(1994), Ma (2005), Ali  (2005), Vaughan  (2008), 
and Jan (2009). Another notable meshless method, 
the Trefftz method, is a boundary-type solution 
procedure that uses only T-complete functions 
satisfying the governing equation. This method was 
first proposed in 1926 by Trefftz. The mathematical 
theory of the Trefftz method has been studied by 
Herrera (1980). Kita  (2004) adopted the Trefftz 
method to simulate non-linear sloshing in a 
two-dimensional rectangular tank. This method does 
present a major drawback in which the resulting 
linear system of equations is seriously ill-conditioned. 
In order to obtain an accurate solution to the resulting 
equations, some special techniques have been used, 
including the singular value decomposition (SVD), 
SVD with a regularisation parameter determined by 
the L-curve method, and sensitivity analysis. Despite 
these efforts, the stability problem remains 
unresolved. To thoroughly overcome these 
difficulties, Liu (2007) proposed a modified Trefftz 
method (MTM) and refined it by incorporating the 
characteristic length into the T-complete functions, 
thus greatly reducing the condition number of the 
resulting system of linear equations. Moreover, Chen 
et al. (2009) applied the MTM to test different 
characteristic lengths in discontinuous boundary 
problem, singular problem, and degenerate geometric 
problem. Besides, this paper will extend the MTM to 
deal with boundary value problem in the 
two-dimensional non-linear sloshing problems.   
On the other hand, one of major concerns in the

the tank, the depth of the liquid, ac
sloshing first mode are shown in table 1, respectively. 
The tank is excited in the horizontal direction with 
acceleration A(t).The initial placement of the 
collocation points is shown in Fig. 2. There are 81 
collocation points and 41 T-complete functions used 
in analysis examples. 
In order to test large amplitude effect, we use free 
oscillation to test stability of modified algorithm. 
When the excited fr
amplitude are 5.5(rad/s) and 0.21(m) at 0.5 second to 
stop exciting, the large amplitude by conventional 
and MSCL algorithm under free oscillation is shown 
in Fig. 3. We can see that the result of  
Conventional algorithm (CA) is almost undisturbed. 
In Fig 4 is plotted the free surface of first slosh mode 
at each time step. The numerical res
100% of the depth of the stationary water, well agree 
with the experimental date of Muto et al.. In Fig 5 is 
shown the time histories of the wave height at the left 
wall for the first mode. We can see that our results 
are better than Liu et al. and the wave height rises to 
0.3 m, which is the same given by Muto et al.. Fig. 6 
is shown time history of volume error ratio of fluid in 
correction before and after. Form Fig 6, we can see 
that the volume error ratio V1 calculated without 
correcting by CA, and the result is not satisfied the 
conservation of mass; on the contrary, the result of 
V2 and V3 is at the same time corrected the position 
and potential of the initial boundary problem, 
satisfying the conservation of mass. Fig. 7 shows the 
time history of the characteristic length at the right- 
and left-ends wall. We can observe that using the 
weighting factor to drive characteristic length can 
avoid to adjustment of MSCL and to keep the 
conservation of mass. We can also use 1 k / ck 1  
to obtain a ratio, the nonlinear term, that quantifies 
the effect/magnitude of nonlinear beha  
right- and left-ends wall. We can find that the change 
of potential is vary with the free surface and is not 
dissipation by the nonlinear term of dynamic 
condition.
