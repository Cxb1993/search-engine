Our research project is the first work that 
deals with the interaction between the timing 
constraints and the power gating. We study the 
simultaneous application of power gating, 
clock skew scheduling, and resource binding. 
We use mathematically programming to 
formally formulate this problem. Our 
approach can be integrated into the high-level 
synthesis of nonzero clock skew circuits. 
Experimental data show that our approach 
achieves very good results.

In this report, we focus on the high-level 
synthesis of power-gated nonzero clock skew 
circuits. A preliminary version of our research 
result has been presented in 2009 ASP-DAC. 
The complete version of our research result 
has been accepted by the Journal of 
Information Science and Engineering. Please 
refer to [18,19]. Given a target clock period 
and design constraints, our objective is to 
derive the minimum-standby-leakage-current 
resource binding solution. We use MILP 
(mixed integer linear programming) to 
formally draw up our problem. It is worth 
mentioning our MILP approach guarantees 
obtaining the optimal solution.  
2. Preliminaries 
In this section, we provide the background 
materials. Section 2.1 presents the functional 
unit library with power gating considered [20]. 
Section 2.2 revisits the resource binding 
problem [21]. Section 2.3 discusses the circuit 
graph to model the hardware in the high-level 
synthesis stage [7,8]. Section 2.4 revisits the 
min-period clock skew scheduling problem 
[1-6]. 
2.1 Functional Units with Power 
Gating 
We assume that the power gating of functional 
unit is employed by a single sleep transistor. 
Note that the same type of functional unit has 
different delay and standby leakage current 
characteristics with varying sizes of sleep 
transistor. Each type of functional unit is 
characterized with some pre-specified sleep 
transistor sizes. Then, in the high-level 
synthesis stage, only these power gating 
implementations can be selected. 
Take the functional unit library shown in 
Table 1 for illustration. The multiplier type is 
characterized with three sleep transistor sizes, 
and the adder type is characterized with two 
transistor sizes. The column Name denotes the 
name of functional unit. The column Delay is 
a two-tuple (min,max), in which min and max 
denote the minimum delay and the maximum 
delay, respectively. The column Leakage 
denotes the standby leakage current. In the 
following, we use the form mul1 ¬ f_m to 
describe that the implementation of multiplier 
mul1 is f_m. 
Suppose we are given two multipliers, called 
mul1 and mul2, and two adders, called add1 
and add2, and we select the power gating 
implementations from the functional unit 
library shown in Table 1. If the power gating 
implementation selection is mul1 ¬ f_m, mul2 
¬ f_m, add1 ¬ f_a, and add2 ¬ f_a, the total 
standby leakage current is 80 (due to 
35+35+5+5); if the power gating 
implementation selection is mul1 ¬ f_m, mul2 
¬ s_m, add1 ¬ f_a, and add2 ¬ s_a, the total 
standby leakage current is 49.

Rj, the clock skew must satisfy both two 
timing constraints: the setup constraint and the 
hold constraint. Let TRi denote the clock 
arrival time of register Ri. The setup constraint 
corresponds to TRi – TRj ≤ P – max(Ri,Rj), 
where P is the clock period. The hold 
constraint corresponds to TRj – TRi ≤ 
min(Ri,Rj). A circuit graph works with clock 
period P, if the clock skew schedule (that is, 
the clock arrival times of registers) satisfies all 
the timing constraints. 
By properly scheduling the clock arrival time 
of registers, the clock period can be shorter 
than the longest combinational delay. The 
min-period clock skew scheduling problem 
[1-6] is to find the smallest feasible clock 
period of a circuit graph. Conventionally, a 
constraint graph is used for solving the 
min-period clock skew scheduling problem in 
polynomial time complexity. In the constraint 
graph, each vertex represents a register and 
each directed edge corresponds to a timing 
constraint. A data path from register Ri to 
register Rj in the circuit graph has two 
directed edges in the corresponding constraint 
graph: the setup constraint is modeled as a 
directed edge Rj→Ri associated with a weight 
P–max(Ri,Rj), and the hold constraint is 
modeled as a directed edge Ri→Rj associated 
with a weight min(Ri,Rj). A circuit graph 
works with clock period P, if and only if the 
corresponding constraint graph contains no 
negative cycle when the clock period is P. 
Take the circuit graph G1 shown in Figure 3 
(a) for illustration. Figure 3 (b) gives the 
corresponding constraint graph Gcg(G1), in 
which the setup constraint is drawn in solid 
line and the hold constraint is drawn in dotted 
line. After applying the min-period clock skew 
scheduling, we find that the smallest feasible 
clock period is 22 and the clock skew 
schedule is Thost = 0, TR1 = 4, TR2 = 12, TR3 = 
0, and TR4 = 12.  
3. Drawback of Existing Flow 
In the existing design flow of nonzero clock 
skew circuits, we only can use a 
post-processing method to reduce the standby 
leakage current after the resource binding is 
performed. The existing design flow includes 
the following four steps. First, we select the 
fastest implementation (that is, the largest 
sleep transistor size) for each type of 
functional unit. Second, we use a conventional 
algorithm, e.g., left edge algorithm [21], to 
assign operations to functional units. Third, 
we use the register binding approach proposed 
in [7,8] to minimize the clock period. Fourth, 
we use the clock skew scheduling approach 
proposed in [20] to select the sleep transistor 
sizes of functional units for reducing the total 
standby leakage current. 
In fact, a bad resource binding solution may 
greatly limit the maximum allowable delays of 
functional units. In the existing design flow, 
since the resource binding is performed 
without considering the maximum allowable 
delays of functional units, the total standby 
leakage current cannot be effectively reduced. 
Let’s use the scheduled DFG shown in Figure 
2 (a) for illustration. Suppose we are given 
two multipliers, two adders, four registers, and 
the target clock period is 22. We only can use 
the fastest implementation for each functional 
unit; that is, mul1 ¬ f_m, mul2 ¬ f_m, add1 
¬ f_a, and add2 ¬ f_a. As a result, the total 
standby leakage current is 80. 
In fact, in this example, there exists a power 
gating implementation selection and resource 
binding solution in which the clock period is 
 8 
a real-value variable Tu that denotes the clock 
arrival time of variable u. For each register Ri, 
we define a real-value variable TRi that stands 
for the clock arrival time of register Ri. 
Next, we introduce our objective function and 
the constraints. Our objective function is to 
minimize the total standby leakage current. 
We can describe the objective function below: 
minimize
z Q w size(fu _ type(z)) z, fu_ type(z),w fu_ type(z),w
f I .
Î Î
< > < >´S S  
The number of functional units in type t is 
|fu(t)|. Therefore, for each type t, we have the 
following constraint: 
z, t,wz fu(t) w size(t)
f | fu(t) | .< >
Î Î
£S S     
z, fu_type(z),ww size(fu_type(z))

Î
=S      
If the functional unit z is not implemented by 
<fu_type(z),w>, then the value of binary 
variable yj,z,<fu_type(z),w> is definitely to be 0. 
Therefore, we have the following constraint: 
j,z, fu _ type(z),w z, fu _ type(z),wy f .< > < >£   
Each operation must be assigned to one 
functional unit. Therefore, for each operation 
oj, we have the following constraint: 
z fu(op _ type( j)) w size(op _ type( j)) j,z, fu _ type(z),w
y 1.
Î Î
< > =S S      
If two operations have overlapping lifetimes, 
they cannot share the same functional unit. 
Suppose operation oj and ok have overlapping 
lifetimes and op_type(j) = op_type(k) = t. For 
each function unit zÎfu(t) and each sleep 
transistor size wÎh(e(z)), we have  
j,z, fu_ type(z),w k,z, fu_ type(z),wy y 1.< > < >+ £   
Let P be a constant that denotes the target 
clock period. For the input variable u and the 
output variable v of operation ok, the 
maximum allowable delay must satisfy the 
setup constraint: 
z fu(op_type(j)) w size(op_type(j)) j,z, fu_type(z),w fu_type(z),w u v
y D P T T.
Î Î
< > < >´ £ - +S S
For the input variable u and the output 
variable v of operation ok, the minimum 
allowable delay must satisfy the hold 
constraint:

Î Î
< > < >- £ ´S S
Suppose we are given n registers, including R1, 
R2, …, and Rn. Each variable (in the 
scheduled DFG) must be assigned to one 
register. Therefore, for each variable u, we 
have

If variable u and variable v have overlapping 
lifetimes, for each register Ri, we have the 
following constraint:  
u ,Ri v ,Rix x 1.+ £           
Let s denote a constant value that is greater 
than any possible clock skew. According to 
[17,18], for every combination of variable u 
and register Ri, we have 
u Ri u,RiT T x ) s.- £ (1- ´       
Ri u u,RiT T x ) s.- £ (1- ´       
 
5.  Experimental Results 
In our experiments, we use the synthesizable 
intellectual properties provided in Synopsys

(1) The notation C is a real-value variable that 
denotes the maximum surge current. 
(2) The notation xi,j represents a binary 
variable (i.e., an 0-1 integer variable). If 
operation oi is scheduled into control step j, 
then binary variable xi,j = 1; otherwise, 
binary variable xi,j = 0.  
(3) The notations Ei and Li are constants that 
denote the earliest possible control step of 
operation oi and the latest possible control 
step of operation oi. We can use the ASAP 
(as-soon-as-possible) and ALAP 
(as-late-as-possible) schedules [4] to 
determine the value Ei and Li for each 
operation oi. 
(4) The notation yi,k represents a binary 
variable. If operation i is assigned to the 
functional unit k, then yi,k = 1; otherwise, 
yi,k = 0. 
(5) The notation zk,j is a binary variable. If the 
functional unit k is active at control step j, 
then zk,j  = 1; otherwise, zk,j  = 0. 
(6) The notations t, n and m are constants that 
denote the number of control steps, the 
number of functional units (the functional 
units are numbered from 1 to n) and the 
number of operations (the operations are 
numbered from 1 to m).   
(7) The notation sk,j is a binary variable. If the 
functional unit k is turned on at control 
step j, then sk,j  = 1; otherwise, sk,j  = 0. 
(8) The notation ck and Lk are constants that 
denote the surge current of function unit k 
and the leakage current of functional unit 
k.  
(9) The notation UB is a constant that denotes 
the upper bound of the leakage current. 
 
Next, we introduce our objective function and 
the constraints. Our optimization goal is to 
minimize the maximum surge current. 
Therefore, our objective function is to 
minimize the value of variable C. 
Every operation must be scheduled into one 
control step. Therefore, for each operation oi, 
we have the following constraint:

The dependency relationship in the DFG must

following constraint:

If two operations are scheduled in the same 
control step, they cannot share the same 
functional unit. Therefore, if for each pair of 
operation oi and operation ol, each control step 
j, and each functional unit k, we have the 
following constraint: 
, , , ,3 ( ).+ £ - +i k l k i j l jy y x x

Suppose that operation oi is scheduled in the 
control step j. If operation oi is assigned to the 
function unit k, the functional unit k is active 
at control step j. Thus, for each operation oi, 
each functional unit k, and each control step j, 
we have the following constraint: 
, , ,1 .+ £ +i j i k k jx y z     
Initially, each functional unit is idle. Therefore, 
for each function unit k, we have the 
following constraint: 
k,0 0.=z      
The summation of the numbers of open 
control steps of all functional units is equal to

Description of the Demo: Power consumption is an important issue to evaluate the performance of 
electronic devices. Dynamic voltage scaling is a new power saving technique to provide different modes for 
various performance requirements. However, due to multiple voltages, the clock skew control becomes very 
difficult. Our laboratory proposes a new clock tree synthesis algorithm to deal with this problem. In addition 
to use traditional load-matching to eliminate the intra-tree clock skew, we use delay matching combined with 
multiplexing to eliminate the inter-tree clock skew in different modes. Experimental results show that our 
approach works well in practice. 
 
●Introduction and Problem Description 
Power consumption is an important issue to evaluate performance of electronic devices. Minimizing 
power consumption is an essential task in circuit design. Multi-voltage design is a commonly used technique 
for low power designs. Instead of using a single voltage for the whole chip, multi-voltage design assigns 
different voltage levels for different functional blocks. Figure 1 shows a multi-voltage design. All signals 
including the clock signal in the top-module, partition-A, and partition-B are assigned to different voltages. 
Dynamic voltage frequency scaling and adaptive voltage scaling are new power saving techniques used 
for power reduction during chip operation to provide different modes for various performance requirements. 
In some handheld electronic devices, there are sleep, standby, and full speed modes to extend the battery 
lifetime. 
Clock tree synthesis requires physical information in order to accurately estimate the output capacitance 
as well as the clock propagation delay. One crucial design issue in a dynamic voltage scaling design is to 
generate a clock tree for different operation modes. The clock tree is required to operate in various voltage 
modes. The objective of our clock tree synthesis methodology is to minimize both the maximum clock tree 
latency and the clock tree skew.  
 
Let's see this example. The design has two partitions.The sub tree A may be in high voltage or low voltage. 
The sub tree B may also be in high voltage or low voltage. The clock tree latency of sub tree A may be 0.4 ns 
or 0.9 ns. The clock tree latency of sub tree B may be 0.2 ns or 0.6 ns. To achieve always zero, our approach 
 6
move the buffer to the center point. So we can minimize the net load. Here we also minimize the maximum 
output load. We calculate the load of clustered flip-flops, we re-assignment the flip-flop which in the 
maximum load cluster to near by cluster. Next we need to minimize the skew of single clock tree. We use 
Load Matching algorithm to do the load compensation. And reach the same load in the same partition. 
Finally we minimize the skew between tree-A and tree-B. After these steps, we can calculate the two 
tree's latencies in different voltage. Our approach combines multiplexing and delay matching. We insert 
delays and balance the four voltage conditions. As a result, we can construct a zero skew multi-voltage clock 
tree design. Back to the cell view, we calculate each path for different voltage and insert delays. Therefore we 
can get zero skew in every condition.

●Experimental Results and Graphic User Interface 
Our C / C++ program platform as follow as table 1. We use three industry circuits to synthesize our 
multi-voltage clock tree design. Circuit 1 has 399 flip-flops. Circuit 2 has 1007 flip-flops. And Circuit 3 has 
1686 flip-flops. We use Synopsys PrimeTime for gate-level timing analysis. In table 2, you can see our 
program can achieve almost zero skew in each condition in every circuit. Table 3 shown as our run time is 
very efficiently. Figure 3 to figure 5 demonstrate our graphic user interface. We can further understand our 
multi-voltage clock tree synthesis framework.

電源閘控制非零時序差異電路之高階合成技術
High-Level Synthesis of Power-Gated Nonzero Clock Skew Circuits

隨著製程技術進入深次微米，漏電流的效應已逐漸顯著。對於事件驅動的應用
，電路大部分時間是處於待機模式，並無任何運算；因此，待機漏電流往往佔
了整體功率消耗的絕大部分。尤其是可攜式行動裝置，待機漏電流更會直接影
響電池壽命，所以必須儘可能的最小化。因此，近幾年，待機漏電流的最小化
，已成為重要的研究課題。電源閘控制可於待機時利用休眠電晶體關閉功能單
元的電源，有效降低待機漏電流；然而，由於休眠電晶體的壓降效應，電源閘
控制亦增加功能單元之運算延遲。本專題研究計畫將探討非零時序差異電路之
電源閘控制。給定時鐘週期的限制，我們研發的成果技術可於高階合成階段，
適當安排每個暫存器之時鐘到達時間，以最小化待機漏電流。
In an event driven application, the circuit spends most of its time
in the standby mode where no computation is performed; as a result,
the standby leakage current is a very large fraction of the total
power consumption. Especially, for portable mobile devices, the
standby leakage current greatly influences the battery life. The
power gating is a useful technique to reduce the standby leakage
current (by using the sleep transistors to shut down the functional
units when the circuit is in standby mode), but it also increases the
delay (due to the voltage drops caused by the sleep transistors). In
this research project, we study the power gating of nonzero clock
skew circuits. Given the clock period constraint, our proposed
approach can minimize the standby leakage current of the circuit by電機及電子機械器材業；研究發展服務業
