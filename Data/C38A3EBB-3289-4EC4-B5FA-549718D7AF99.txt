ABSTRACT 
Ti-6Al-4V sheet specimens were cathodically 
hydrogenated in sulfuric acid solution at 
ambient conditions, and then sent to go through 
a designed thermohydrogen processing (THP) 
twice to obtain a nano-sized grain structure. 
The average grain size of resulted 
microstructure was examined by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) to be 10-20 nm. 
Qualitative and quantitative analyses performed 
by employing X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and 
elemental analysis (EA) showed that the 
addition of As2O3 as hydrogenation promoter in 
electrolyte significantly increased the hydrogen 
uptake. The high concentration of hydrogen 
arising from promoter action is the key factor 
in grain refinement. The optimal processing 
parameter found for grain-refining Ti-6Al-4V 
was: (1) electrolytic hydrogenation at 100 
mA/cm2 for 3 hours in 1N H2SO4(aq) by adding 
0.1g/L As2O3; (2) β transformation carried out 
at 850℃ for 1 hour in air furnace, followed by 
a furnace cooling to 590℃ and held for 6 hours; 
(3) oxide film removed and then 
dehydrogenated at 650℃ and 1.0 × 10-6 torr for 
10 hours; (4) repeated the same processes once 
more.

INTRODUCTION  
It is well known that titanium has high 
affinity to hydrogen and is susceptible to brittle 
failure even at very low level of hydrogen 
concentration [1]. The embrittlement mainly 
results from the formation of hydride 
precipitates, which are usually the locations of 
 3
in Fig. 1. The specimen designations are listed 
in Table 2. 
Bulk hydrogen concentrations were 
determined by employing an elemental 
analyzer (EA, Heraeus VarioEL-III). The 
accuracy was to be within ± 5% of the 
measured hydrogen concentration. 
Microstructural variation were observed by 
using X-ray diffractometry (XRD: Siemens 
D5000), optical microscopy (OM), scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM: JEOL 2010).  
3. RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
3.1. Effect of hydrogenation promoter 
Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of the β 
specimen. Fig. 2(b) shows the XRD pattern of 
the H0 specimen. The α peaks shown in Fig. 
2(b), especially α(010), exhibited relatively 
lower intensity than that shown in Fig. 2(a). No 
hydride peak was detected in Fig. 2(b), while 
βH peaks (β solid solution of hydrogen) are 
presented. The βH peaks shifting to the lower 
angle direction indicated the relaxation of 
crystal perfection arising from hydrogen atoms 
dissolution into β phase [13, 14]. The hydrogen 
concentration of the H0 specimen was 0.05 
wt% measured by EA. Fig. 2(c) shows the 
XRD pattern of the H1 specimen. Addition of 
0.1g/l As2O3 to the electrolyte significantly 
increased the intensity of hydride peaks, 
whereas depressed those of α and β peaks in 
the pattern 2(c). The hydrogen concentration of 
H1 specimen was measured to be 0.54 wt%. 
Hydrogen uptake had been drastically 
increased due to the addition of As2O3 in the 
electrolyte. A promoter action which should be 
related to the formation of promoter hydride in 
following reaction [15] took place: 
2Ti + AsH3 → TiAsH2 + Ti-H 
As2O3 cannot act as a promoter unless it was 
reduced to AsH3. The suitable working 
conditions for As2O3 to be reduced are 
potentials more negative than -0.4 V and pH 
values less than 5.0 [16]. In order to reduce 
As2O3 to AsH3 effectively, the applied potential 
in this study was kept below -1.0 V at the given 
cathodic current density of 100 mA/cm2. 
3.2. The cyclic THP treatment (Cycle 1) 
Specimens containing hydrogen over 0.5 
wt% can then be β transformed at 850℃ to 
obtain uniform β phase [8-10]. After the 
specimens (β1) had been quenched to room 
temperature, the resulting microstructure was 
composed of βH phase, hexagonal αH' and 
orthorhombic αH'' martensite. The 
corresponding XRD pattern was shown in Fig. 
2(d). The αH'' peaks coincided closely with the 
corresponding αH' ones with lower intensity. 
Optical micrograph (Fig. 3(a)) indicating these 
martensites precipitated in the interior of βH 
phase either in wide lath shape (αH'' phase) or 
acicular form (αH' phase). 
Having been β transformation treated, the 
specimen (β1) was then continuously cooled to 
590℃ and held for 6 hours to undergo 
eutectoid decomposition (U1 specimen), and 
finally quenched to room temperature. The 
XRD pattern (Fig. 2(e)) of quenched U1 
 5
grain size as low as 20 μm [17]. The grain 
refining efficiency of dehydrogenated Ti-64 
specimen after the first THP cycle in this study 
was undoubted should be higher than that 
obtained in reference [17], because both the 
average hydrogen content of H1 specimen 
(0.41 wt%) and the level of vacuum during 
dehydrogenation process (1.0×10-6 torr) were 
more suitable to obtain desirable result.  
In contrast to the coarse microstructure of 
β0 specimens, D1 specimens with micron size 
grains served as the starting material at the 
beginning of the 2nd THP cycle and were 
hydrogenated at the same conditions as those of 
β0 specimens. Evident grain-boundary 
diffusion effect [18] brought about the higher 
average hydrogen content of H2 specimen 
(0.65 wt%). The much higher hydrogen 
concentration than the lower threshold for grain 
refining, thus, offered the driving force to 
obtain the final nano-sized microstructure. 
Combination of adding As2O3 as hydrogenation 
promoter to increase the hydrogen uptake with 
employing a refined starting material was the 
crux in this study.  
CONCLUSIONS 
The addition of As2O3 as hydrogenation 
promoter is a crucial factor during cathodic 
charging. The hydrogen concentration for the 
specimen charged with adding promoter was 
over 0.5 wt%, which is ten times of magnitude 
larger than those without adding, and suitable 
to allow the specimen undergoing the designed 
THP. The break-up structure obtained after the 
1st THP cycle served as a stepping-stone for 
further refinement in the 2nd THP cycle and 
resulted in the nano-sized grain structure. Such 
a result can be bracketed with that achieved by 
dynamic thermohydrogen processing.
