Abstract 
 
In this project, we are going to study some parallel machine scheduling problems with learning 
effect and past-sequence-dependent setup time. In the learning effect model, we consider the 
job-independent learning effect model. As to setup time, we consider a special type of setup 
time which occurs in high-tech electronic component manufacturing. In this situation, those 
already tackled jobs have an adverse effect on the setup. That is, the setup time is proportional 
to the total amount of processing time in those jobs already tackled. Meanwhile, we are also 
discussing the setup time with learning effect or without learning effect. We plan to consider 
different scheduling performances, such as to minimize the makespan, the total completion time 
or the total absolute differences in completion times in parallel scheduling problems. 
 
Keywords: learning effect, scheduling, parallel machine

recently (see Alidaee and Womer, 1999, Cheng et al., 2004 and Biskup, 2008). Kuo and Yang 
(2007) incorproated the p-s-d setup time and learning effects into a single machine scheduling 
problem. They considered the scheduling measures of the makespan, the total completion time, 
TADC and the sum of earliness, tardiness and common due-date penalty and showed that these 
problems all remain polynomially solvable. Wang (2008) studied a single-machine scheduling 
problem with p-s-d setup time and time-dependent learning effect and showed that the objective 
functions of the makespan, the total completion time, and the sum of the quadratic job 
completion time minimization can be solved in polynomial time, respectively. He also showed 
that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness 
minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions. Wang et al. 
(2009) considered a single-machine scheduling problem with exponential time-dependent 
learning effect and p-s-d setup time. They showed that the makespan minimization problem, the 
total completion time minimization problem and the sum of the quadratic job completion time 
minimization problem can be solved by the shortest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule. 
They also showed that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the 
maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain 
conditions. 
 
In this note, we will consider TADC as scheduling measure and study an unrelated parallel 
machine problem simultaneously with p-s-d setup time and learning effects. We show that the 
proposed problem remains polynomially solvable. In addition, two special cases are also 
discussed. 
 
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
 
There are n jobs { }( )1 2, ,..., nJ J J J=  to be processed on m unrelated parallel machines ( jM , j = 
1, 2,…, m). Let iS  denote the set of jobs assigned to iM . Then i jS S∩ =∅ , i j∀ ≠ , and 
{ }11 ,...,m j nj S J J= =U . Let jn  denote the number of jobs assigned to jM  and 1m jjn n==∑ . We assume, 
as in practical situations, that m n< . All jobs are non-resumable and available for processing at 
time zero. Each machine can handle at most one job at a time and cannot stand idle until the last 
job assigned to it has finished processing. Let 
ijp  denote the normal processing time of job i 
( i∈{1, 2,…, n}) when assigned to machine 
jM . Then the actual processing time of job i when 
scheduled in position r of 
jM  is given by:

/ , /ijaijr ij psdPm p p r s TADC=  minimization on unrelated parallel machines can be formulated as an 
assignment problem. Let 
1 2( , ) ( , ,..., )mP n m n n n=  denote the allocation vectors. For a 
given ( , )P n m vector, the problem can be described by a standard bi-partite graph with n job nodes 
and n position nodes. We denote a job node by i ( 1, 2,...,i n= ), and a position node by 
( , )j r (position r on machine jM , 1,2,..., jr n= , 1, 2,...,j m= ). Then the cost of the arc that connects i 
and( , )j r is given by

a 0/1 variable such that 1ijrx =  if iJ  is the rth job to be processed on machine jM  and 0ijrx =  
otherwise. Then the scheduling problem can be formulated as the following assignment problem.

However, it is necessary to obtain the total number of ( , )P n m  vectors to completely solve 
the problem / , /ijaijr ij psdPm p p r s TADC= . Though there is no simple expression for ( , )P n m , a simple 
polynomial upper bound of the number of ( , )P n m  vectors is given in Lemma 1. 
 
Lemma 1. (Mosheiov, 2001) The number of ( , )P n m  vectors is bounded by (2 ) !mn m . 
 
Theorem 1. The problem / ,ijaijr ijPm p p r=  /psds TADC  can be solved in 3( )mO n +  time. 
Proof. According to Lemma 1, to solve the problem / , /ijaijr ij psdPm p p r s TADC= , a polynomial 
number of assignment problems need to be solved. Each assignment problem is solved in 3( )O n  
time. Hence, the time complexity of the problem is 3( )mO n +  time.     □

Abstract— In this paper, we study an unrelated parallel machine 
scheduling problem simultaneously with learning effect and setup 
time. The setup time is proportional to the length of the already 
processed jobs. That is, the setup time of each job is past-
sequence-dependent. The objective is to minimize the total 
absolute deviation of job completion times. We show that the 
proposed problem is polynomially solvable. 
Keywords- past-sequence-dependent, learning effect, unrelated 
parallel machine, scheduling; total absolute deviation of job 
completion times 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The setup time in classical scheduling problems is 
considered either sequence independent or sequence dependent 
[1](see Allahverdi et al., 1999). In the first case, the setup time 
is usually added to the job processing time while in the second 
case the setup time depends not only on the job currently being 
scheduled but also on the last scheduled job. Koulamas and 
Kyparisis [2] first introduced past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d) 
setup time, which happens in high-tech testing environment, 
into a single-machine scheduling problem. They showed that 
the problem with the objectives of minimizing the makespan, 
the total completion time (TC), TADC and a linear 
combination of TC and TADC can be optimally solved in 
polynomial time. Biskup and Herrmann [3] considered single-
machine scheduling problems with past-sequence-dependent 
setup times and due dates. They showed that the problems of 
minimizing total lateness, total tardiness (with agreeable due 
dates), maximum lateness (with agreeable due dates), 
maximum tardiness (with agreeable due dates) and the problem 
of Kanet [4] remain polynomially solvable. For other problems, 
namely, minimizing the number of tardy jobs, maximum 
lateness, and maximum tardiness, the well-known solution 
procedures that find the optimal solution are no longer valid.  
 
On the other hand, the topic of learning effects is very 
popular in scheduling problems recently [5,6,7]. Kuo and Yang 
[8] incorproated the p-s-d setup time and learning effects into a 
single machine scheduling problem. They considered the 
scheduling measures of the makespan, the total completion 
time, TADC and the sum of earliness, tardiness and common 
due-date penalty and showed that these problems all remain 
polynomially solvable. Wang [9] studied a single-machine 
scheduling problem with p-s-d setup time and time-dependent 
learning effect and showed that the objective functions of the 
makespan, the total completion time, and the sum of the 
quadratic job completion time minimization can be solved in 
polynomial time, respectively. He also showed that the total 
weighted completion time minimization problem and the 
maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in 
polynomial time under certain conditions. Wang et al. [10] 
considered a single-machine scheduling problem with 
exponential time-dependent learning effect and p-s-d setup 
time. They showed that the makespan minimization problem, 
the total completion time minimization problem and the sum of 
the quadratic job completion time minimization problem can be 
solved by the shortest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule. 
They also showed that the total weighted completion time 
minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization 
problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain 
conditions. 
In this note, we will consider TADC as scheduling measure 
and study an unrelated parallel machine problem 
simultaneously with p-s-d setup time and learning effects. We 
show that the proposed problem remains polynomially solvable. 
In addition, two special cases are also discussed.  
This research was supported in part by the National Science Council of 
Taiwan, Republic of China, under granted number NSC-98-2221-E-150-032.   
problem is solved in 3( )O n  time. Hence, the time complexity 
of the problem is 3( )mO n +  time.   □ 
 
Corollary 1. The problem 2 / ,ijaijr ijP p p r=  /psds TADC  is 
solved in 4( )O n  time. 
Proof. In a two-machine problem, if 
1 2( , 2) ( , )P n n n= vector is 
given, the problem is solved as an assignment problem in 
3( )O n time. We have to solve such a problem for 
each
1 2( , )n n vector. The relevant pairs are ( ,0)n , ( 1,1)n − , …, 
(1, 1)n − , (0, )n . Therefore, we have to solve such an 
assignment problem n times. Thus, the problem 
2 / , /ijaijr ij psdP p p r s TADC=  is solved in 4( )O n  time.     □  
IV. SPECIAL CASE 
In this section, we will discuss a special case of the 
unrelated parallel machine problem.  
First, a technique to obtain the minimum sum of the 
product of two sequences of numbers is introduced in the 
Lemma 2. 
Lemma 2. Let there be two sequences of numbers ix  and iy . 
The sum i ii x y∑  of products of the corresponding elements 
is the least (largest) if the sequences are monotonic in the 
opposite (same) sense (see [14]). 
 
Then, the special case of 
ij ip p= , ija a=  and jb b=  for the 
problem is discussed. That is, the unrelated parallel machine 
problem becomes an identical parallel machine problem. The 
normal processing of job i is ip  no matter what machine the 
job is assigned to. Also, the setup time is b for all machines and 
the learning effect is job-independent.  
 
Theorem 2. The problem / ,aijr iPm p p r=  , /psd js b b TADC=  
can be optimally solved in 1( log )mO n n+ . 
Proof. Suppose that 
1( , ) ( ,..., )mP n m n n=  vector is known. That 
is, the number of jobs assigned to each machine is given. Let 
[ ]j rJ  denote the job assigned to the rth position on machine 
jM . Therefore, { }[1] [2] [ ], ,..., jj j j j nS J J J=  and 
{ }11 ,...,m j nj S J J= =U . Let [ ]j rp  denote the normal processing 
time of job 
[ ]j rJ . Then the total completion time of all jobs in 
these machines is calculated as follows:

 for 
1, 2,...,j m=  and 1,2,..., jr n= . Then (3) can be viewed as the 
scalar product of the 
jrw  and [ ]j rp  
vectors ( 1, 2,...,j m=  and 
1,2,..., jr n= ). Therefore, by Lemma 2, all jobs are sorted in 
non-decreasing order of their normal processing times first. 
Then the job with the longest normal processing time is 
assigned to the position with the smallest value of 
jrw , the job 
with the second longer normal processing time to the position 
with the second smaller value of 
jrw , …, and so on. The time 
complexity of a sorting algorithm is ( log )O n n  and the number 
of ( , )P n m  vectors is bounded by (2 ) !mn m . Therefore, the 
problem / ,aijr iPm p p r=  , /psd js b b TADC=  can be solved in 
1( log )mO n n+ .     □ 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an unrelated parallel machine scheduling 
problem with the p-s-d setup time and learning effects is 
studied. The scheduling measure of the total absolute deviation 
of job completion times is considered. We show that the 
problem with the scheduling measure is polynomially 
solvable. . Besides, a special case of the proposed problem is 
discussed and can be solved by lower order algorithms. Future 
research may focus on other scheduling performance measures 
or a similar problem with other learning effects and setup time 
models.
