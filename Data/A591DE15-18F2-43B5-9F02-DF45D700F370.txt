Abstract 
 
This is the final report of a two years project for investigating the wave 
propagation characteristics and sound insulation properties of an anisotropic FRP (Fiber 
reinforced plastics) panel. 
For flat structure, TMM (Transfer matrix method) was applied in this work to 
calculate the sound transmission loss of orthotropic plates. FRP is an anisotropic 
material. However, the traditional TMM is only suitable for isotropic material. In this 
work, therefore, the sound wave equation of FRP is prepared and the special TMM that 
suits FRP laminate is established. In first year, a 2-D acoustic model for analyzing the 
sound wave propagation in a FRP flat plate is investigated at first. This theory is only 
suitable for the FRP panel such as Mat that possesses transverse isotropy in in-plane 
direction. The transfer matrix of the 2-D models will be established. Then, the sound 
transmission losses of FRP plate with different laminates are analyzed and compared to 
the experimental measurements. In order to improve the accuracy of the numerical 
results and also extend the capacity of the present method, the 2-D approach then is 
extended and then the 3-D model for investigating the sound insulation of FRP panels is 
established. The numerical solutions are also compared to experimental results and the 
agreement is good. Further, the parameters, such as Young modulus, shear modulus, 
thickness etc., that influence the sound insulation properties are analyzed and discussed.   
Moreover, from sound wave propagation of the FRP, the evaluation of the material 
properties on thickness-direction for Uni-direction laminate is also obtained. Many 
works have focused on the material properties of orthotropic materials. An orthotropic 
material possesses nine parameters, namely three Young’s moduli, three shear moduli 
and three Poisson ratios. Most investigations have discussed at in-plane material 
constants, reducing the nine independent material constants to four. However, for some 
studies with 3-D modeling, the material constants in the through-thickness direction are 
also very important. The in-plane material constants can be obtained experimentally, but 
the through-thickness material constants are difficult to measure. The convenient 
method applied to estimate the through-thickness material constants of unidirectional 
laminate is also presented in the study.

acoustic penetrating property of FRP correctly. Although the calculating procedure 
described by Allard and Ko ([10], [11]) is well-defined practice, it is based on isotropic 
models and may not be suited to the orthotropic materials. Thus, this study is an 
extension to the theory for analyzing the orthotropic materials. The mathematical model 
to simulate the acoustic properties of orthotropic laminate is established and discussed 
in this work. However, the technique is limited to cases where regular well definite 
geometric shape were studied, as for irregular shapes, numerical analyses must be 
adapted to better approximate the geometry without much loss of accuracy. 
 
    The theories provided in the study induce 2-D TMM, 3-D TMM algorithm. Some 
numerical calculations of the theories are presented. The results in the work will be 
compared with experiment. By executing this research, it is expected to contribute the 
field that use FRP frequently and respect sound properties.

2.2 Transversely Material Equation 
An orthotropic material possesses nine parameters, namely three Young’s moduli, 
three shear moduli and three Poisson ratios. Most investigations have discussed at 
in-plane material constants, reducing the nine independent material constants to four. 
However, for some studies with 3-D modeling, the material constants in the thickness 
direction are also very important. The in-plane material constants can be obtained 
experimentally, but the thickness direction material constants are difficult to measure. In 
this work, the relationships between the nine mechanical properties are revealed by the 
wave equations of an orthotropic material. For the derivation to be valid, two 
restrictions have to be satisfied. First, the suitable cases are only UD (Uni-Directional) 
laminate possessing the transverse isotropic property. Second, the distributions of the 
fibers in the cross-section of UD laminate must be uniform. On the base, the shear 
modulus and the Poisson ratio through the thickness direction of the UD material can be 
computed from the simple relationships. 
In Eq. (2.1), the nine terms ijQ  depend on nine material parameters including 
three Young’s moduli, three shear moduli  and three Poisson’s ratios. In Lekhnitski’s 
study [21], ijQ  is shown as

where, 11E , 22E  and 33E  are the Young’s moduli in the principal direction ( 1x , 2x  
and 3x ), 12G , 13G  and 23G  are shear modulus, and 12ν , 13ν  and 23ν  are 
Poisson’s ratios. 
In Ref. [21], the displacement is expressed as

In this work, the main cases are UD materials. Figure 2.4 shows the coordinate 
system of the UD material. The material possesses transversely isotropy in 2x - 3x  
plane. The distribution of the fibers in 2x - 3x  plane is uniform. In this figure, the 
fibers-orientation is towards 1x  axis. The values of 11E , 22E , 12G  and 12ν  in a UD 
material can be measured experimentally. However, the other five material parameters 
are difficult measure experimentally. In the study, he UD lamina is assumed to be 
transversely isotropic materials, meaning that 22E = 33E , 12G = 13G , 12ν = 13ν  and 23G  
could be expressed as

Thus, the only unknown quantity is 23ν . Furthermore, Eq. (2.23) is not significant, and 
Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25) should be merged, since 12Q = 13Q  and 55Q = 66Q . Combine the 
equations of Eqs (2.24), (2.16) and (2.17) yielding the expression for 23ν .

2.3 The Transfer Matrix Method with the 2-D Model

where 0C  and 0k  are the speed and wave number of the air. θ  is the incident angle 
of sound wave. Given that the thickness of the composite material is finite, the 
reflection effect causes four waves to be presented in the material. φ  and 2ψ  can be 
expressed as

where 1R  and 2R  are the amplitude of the incident waves, 1R′  and 2R′  are the 
amplitudes of the reflection waves and ω  is the angular frequency. The wave numbers 
of the compression and shear wave in the thickness direction are

For the convenience, four independent physical parameters are used to replace the 
amplitudes. The four independent parameters are velocities, 1v  and 3v , and stresses, 
33σ  and 13σ . Substituting Eqs. (2.29) and (2.30) into Eq. (2.3) yields the displacement 
u  of the sound wave in the composite material. Differentiating u  with respect to time 
yields 1v  and 3v . And, stresses 33σ  and 13σ  are determined from Eq. (2.10). Let

2.3.4 Transmission Loss in 2-D model 
The transfer matrix of each layer and boundary condition of interface can be 
obtained from above formulas. Hence, no matter what type of material is used or how 
many interfaces exist, if the corresponding boundary conditions of each laminate is in 
the form of the above matrix, sound transmission matrix can be derived. Specifically, 
though the combination matrices, the sound transmission matrix for entering A and 
exiting B can be expressed in the following

Chapter 3 Numerical Results and Discussions 
 
3.1 The Verifications 
3.1.1 The Verifications of Transversely Material Equation 
As described as section 2.2, the investigation presents three formulae of the 
material constants. A simple method is applied to determine the material properties of a 
unidirectional lamina (UD) in the through-thickness direction. The mechanical 
characteristics of an orthotropic composite material generally require nine parameters: 
three Young’s moduli, three shear moduli and three Poisson’s ratios. Most studies 
concentrate on two orthogonal axial moduli, a shear modulus and a Poisson’s ratio in 
the plane of the lamina. Four material parameters were adopted in those works instead 
of nine. However, some cases in many studies are based on a three-dimension modeling, 
making the nine material constants necessary. The four material parameters can not 
satisfy such cases. However, the material constants through the thickness direction 
cannot easily be measured experimentally. In this work, the relationships between the 
nine mechanical properties are revealed by the wave equations of an orthotropic 
material. Two restrictions in the study are considered. First, the suitable cases are only 
UD possessing the transverse isotropic property. Second, the distributions of the fibers 
in the cross-section of UD laminate must be uniform. On the base, the shear modulus 
and the Poisson ratio through the thickness direction of the UD material can be 
computed from the simple relationships. In the present method, the following limited 
assumptions should be considered. 
1. There are one compression wave (the scalar displacement potential) and three shear 
waves (the vector displacement potentials) in an orthotropic material. 
2. The predictions of 23G  and 23ν  are available only for unidirectional materials 
which possess transverse isotropy in 2x - 3x  plane. 
3. The cross-section ( 2x - 3x  plane, see Fig. 2.4) of the UD lamina must be uniform. 
Only UD materials which are homogeneous and transversely isotropic in 2x - 3x  
plane are considered in this work, Table 3.1 shows the material characteristics of the UD 
materials, which are excerpted from Ref. [22]. The constituent properties of the UD 
material were evaluated in the final element analysis (FEA). In the present work, 23G * 
is determined from Eqs. (2.26 and 2.27) with the known 11E , 22E , 12G  and 12ν . The 
eight samples exhibited acceptable agreement in terms of the proposed method and that 
of Ref. [22]. The comparisons indicate that the present formulae can simulate the 
material properties through the thickness of the UD material. Furthermore, the present 
method is simpler than the numerical method. 
Table 3.2 presents another unidirectional material which was used in Jansson’s 
study [23]. In Ref. [23], the mainly material properties 11E , 12G , 12ν , 13ν  and 23ν  
 26
[mat2/mat1/mat2/mat1/mat2/mat1/mat2]. It shows a limited difference between the 
experimental and numerical results at lower frequencies while more significant 
differences exist at higher frequencies. Below 1500 Hz, the difference in TL between 
the numerical and experimental results is lower than 5 dB, so the numerical and 
experimental results are in agreement in the low and mid frequency ranges. Above 1500 
Hz however, the numerical results do not match with the experimental results. At 2000 
Hz, the deviation approaches 4.5 dB. The most discrepancy is close to 6 dB at 4000 Hz. 
Figure 3.3 shows the comparison between the present method and references [10, 
27]. The isotropic steel plate with Young's modulus, 206 Gpa, density, 7800 Kg/m3, 
Poisson’s ratio, 0.29 and thickness, 0.8 mm was considered. In Harris’s study [27], the 
procedure is following ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) E-90. It is 
seen that the numerical results correspond to experimental results except at very low 
frequency region where the finite size and boundary fixing condition of the plate 
become important. Moreover, for experimental results and mass law (refer to [28]), the 
comparison shows that the present method correctly approaches mass law behavior for 
the sample. The comparisons demonstrate that the numerical calculation could simulate 
the experimental measurement. 
 
3.1.3 The Verifications of 3-D TMM Model 
To confirm the proposed theory, three orthotropic layers of glass fiber composite 
were prepared, namely [UD]7, [Mat]7, [Rovin]7. Each of the three laminates comprises 
seven layers because the single FRP lamina is too thin. Table 3.6 presents the material 
properties of the three samples. Figure 3.4 displays the schemas of the three orthotropic 
materials UD, mat and rovin. The total thickness of the three laminates are as follows, 
3.521 mm for [UD]7, 2.807 mm for [Mat]7 and 3.003 mm for [Rovin]7. Figures 3.5, 3.6 
and 3.7 display the experimental and numerical results for [UD]7, [Mat]7 and [Rovin]7. 
In the Figures the numerical and experimental results are in agreement. In Figs. 3.5 ~ 
3.7, the systematic errors are seen at the very low end of the frequency range (due to the 
finite size of the experimental panels). Moreover, rovin and UD performed better than 
that mat in terms of sound insulation. The surface density of [UD]7 is more than that of 
[Rovin]7 but the sound transmission loss of [UD]7 is less than that of [Rovin]7. The 
result is different to mass law (refer to [28]).

3.2 The Numerical Results of 2-D TMM Models 
In this section, the influence of mechanical properties of orthotropic layers were 
analyzed and discussed. The isotropic layer which possesses material properties E  = 
11 GPa, G  = 4.4 GPa, ρ  = 1800 kg/m3, υ  = 0.25, and thickness = 0.289 mm was 
selected as the basis in the analysis. Figure 3.8 presents the sound transmission loss 
provided by an isotropic layer with different Young’s modulus. It is seen that the 
increasing of Young’s modulus of the isotropic material will not change the sound 
transmission loss. In mass law, the sound transmission loss of a thin plate is only 
determined by the mass of the plate, not the stiffness. The present calculation results 
show similarities with mass law. 
Figure 3.9 plots the transmission loss provided by a specially orthotropic layer and 
shows the effect of varying the parameter 11E  in the range of 
9
11 101 ≤≤ /EE . 
Comparing Figs. 3,8 and 3.9, the transmission loss will increase obviously if stiffness in 
x1-direction increases in the situation of the material being not isotropic. The result is 
similar to Koval’s [13] and Chonan’s [30] works. Although mass law is a commonly 
applied theoretical rule that applies to most isotropic materials, it does not suit 
orthotropic material. Moreover, the critical angles cθ  are listed in Table 3.7, which are 
obtained by using Eq. (2.31 and 2.32) with setting the wave numbers equal to zero. As 
11E  becomes very large, the critical angle of incidence is almost °0 . In other words, 
the high bending stiffness leads to very small bending wave so only the plane sound 
wave can be transmitted. This phenomenon leads to an upper bound of sound 
transmission loss as 11E  become infinite. The influence of shear modulus 13G  on 
transmission loss was also investigated. Figure 3.10 shows the effect of decreasing 13G  
from 1/13 =GG  to 2013 10/ −=GG  while the other mechanical properties of the layer 
are not changed. In Fig. 3.10, the sound transmission loss will be enhanced if the shear 
stiffness is lowered. These findings are consistent with Koval’s [13], Blaise’s [15] and 
Chonan’s [30] studies. 
Figure 3.11 presents the sound transmission loss provided by a medium composed 
of layers. An isotropic and specially orthotropic samples are considered respectively. 
The isotropic layer possesses the material properties E , G , ρ , ν , and thickness 
equal to the basis. In this work, the mechanical properties of the specially orthotropic 
layer are same as that of the isotropic layer except 11E . For this specially orthotropic 
layer, 5/11 =EE . The thickness of the medium is proportional to the layer numbers. It 
demonstrates the thickness effect on sound transmission loss. Fig. 3.11 shows that the 
sound transmission loss will increase as the laminate thickness increase. Large thickness 
and high mass correspond to great structural bending stiffness. Therefore, increasing 
layers causes the sound-insulating ability of the medium to expand. The result gives

3.3 The Numerical Results of 3-D TMM Models 
To understand the differences of acoustic characteristic in isotropic and orthotropic 
materials, an isotropic layer with material properties E  = 10 GPa, G  = 4 GPa, ρ  = 
1500 kg/m3, ν = 0.25, and thickness = 3 mm was selected as the basis in the analysis. 
The sound transmission coefficient of a material can be determined by Eq. (2.45), where 
θ  and Θ  are so-called latitudinal and longitudinal incident angles. Figures 3.14 and 
3.15 demonstrate the contrast of sound properties between an isotropic and an 
orthotropic material. Figure 3.14 (a) shows the contour of transmission coefficient of an 
isotropic layer at various angles at a frequency of 500 Hz. In this figure, the contour is 
axially symmetrical in the Θ  direction because of the isotropic properties of the 
sample. Figure 3.14 (b) plots the transmission coefficient of the case where °=Θ 0 . In 
this figures, a large θ  corresponds to a high value. The maximum value of 
transmission coefficient drops rapidly to zero as °→ 90θ . Figure 3.15 presents the 
orthotropic case. In this case, the Young’s modulus of model 11E  in the 1x  direction 
is increased to 15 GPa, while the other material properties retain their original values. In 
Fig. 3.15 (a), since 11E  is bigger than 22E , the incident wave at °=Θ 0  is less than 
that at °=Θ 90 . Fig. 3.15 (b) displays the transmission coefficient as °=Θ 0  and 
°=Θ 90 . In this figures, °= 30θ  corresponds to the high value as °=Θ 0 . The 
maximum value of transmission coefficient falls rapidly to zero as °≥ 30θ . The sound 
wave is difficultly incident to the laminate. The vibration on 1x -direction is fewer than 
that on the other directions because 11E  is large. As °=Θ 90 , the result in Fig. 3.15 (b) 
is similar to Fig. 3.14 (b). Furthermore, the sharp peak in Fig. 3.14 (b) implies that the 
variation of incident angles in the peak region is very large. 
This section analyzes and discusses the effect of varying the material properties. 
Figure 3.16 depicts the sound transmission loss of the isotropic layers whose surface 
densities are invariable with varying Young’s modulus, E ′ . The value of /EE ′  was set 
to 1, 2, 5 and 10. Poisson’s ratio does not change. Shear modulus of the material varies 
with E ′  because of isotropy ( )1(2/ υ+= EG ). Figure 3.16 shows that increasing the 
Young’s modulus of the isotropic material does not change the sound transmission loss, 
but does alter the critical and coincidence frequencies [33]. The present calculation 
results are similar to those obtained with mass law. In mass law, the sound transmission 
loss of a thin and isotropic plate is only determined by the mass of the plate, rather than 
the stiffness. However, the phenomenon of coincidence cannot be observed from mass 
law. The case of Fig. 3.16 is as similar as that of Fig. 3.8 that the numerical data are 
estimated by 2-D TMM simulation. However, the results of Fig. 3.16 are provided from 
3-D TMM calculation. 
An orthotropic material is assumed to possess nine independent parameters, 
namely three Young’s moduli, three shear moduli and three Poisson ratios. Figure 3.17

Chapter 4 Conclusions 
The primary goal of this study is to analyze acoustical properties of anisotropic 
composite materials. The mathematical theories applied to estimate the sound 
transmission properties are established, including the orthotropic wave equations, 
transversely material equation, 2-D TMM and 3-D TMM. 
For composite plates, the sound transmission loss across orthotropic composites 
was predicted with 2-D and 3-D TMM in the investigation. If the model is a composite 
laminate that possesses a transverse isotropy in in-plane, 2-D TMM is appropriate for 
the case. If the composite laminate does not possess the transverse isotropy in the 
in-plane, 3-D TMM is used. In 2-D TMM, rather than offering a solution for the exact 
sound wave amplitudes, four physical parameters are integrated to calculate 
transmission loss. As 3-D TMM is operated, the four physical parameters are increased 
to nine. The influence of mechanical properties on sound insulation was analyzed and 
discussed in the work. 
Further, transversely material equation was also yielded to evaluate the elastic 
modulus through the thickness direction of a unidirectional material. In the part, two 
restrictions are considered. First, the suitable cases are only UD possessing the 
transverse isotropic property. Second, the distributions of the fibers in the cross-section 
of UD laminate must be uniform. On the base, the shear modulus and the Poisson ratio 
through the thickness direction of the UD material can be computed from the simple 
relationships. 
This research focused on constructing a mathematical model to accurately predict 
the sound respondence of orthotropic composites. Based on the results of the study, the 
following is concluded. 
1. Experiments demonstrated that the numerical calculation can reasonably simulate 
the measured data. The excellent agreements are achieved between the theoretical 
calculations and experimental results. The thick, stiff, and low shear modulus 
materials correspond to the great sound insulation. 
2. The validation of 2-D TMM has only been done on one sample laminated specially 
orthotropic composite panel. Therefore care must be taken to treat the simulation 
results. Reasonable accuracy is seen in the low to mid frequency region where the 
error is less than 5 dB. Systematic errors are seen at the very low end of the 
frequency range, due to the finite size of the experimental panel, and at frequencies 
above 1500 Hz. Care must be taken to treat the simulation results. 
3. It is generally known that 23G  of an orthotropic lamina could not be derived from 
the in-plane experiment. However, in the work of transversely material equation, for 
the specially cases, the unidirectional material based on the transverse isotropy,
