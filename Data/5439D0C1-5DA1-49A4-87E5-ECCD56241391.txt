Abstract 
In recent years ultrasound imaging has become an attractive modality for noninvasive temperature monitoring. 
Temperature variations that occur during tissue heating could induce changes in various acoustic parameters 
that may affect the echo interference so as to make ultrasound backscattering a random process. In this study 
we assumed that the degree of variation in the probability distribution of the backscattered signals is 
temperature dependent. The feasibility of using the variation in the backscatter statistics for ultrasound 
temperature estimation was investigated in this study. We tested this hypothesis by carrying out experiments 
on agar phantoms and tissue samples using a temperature-regulated water tank and a microwave ablation 
system. During heating, raw images of the backscattered-signal envelope of each phantom and tissue at 
temperatures ranging between 37°C and 45°C were acquired to construct the parametric matrix based on the 
ratio of the change in the Nakagami parameter (RCN), which was used as a quantitative measure of the 
backscatter statistics. The absolute value of the RCN (ARCN) matrix was obtained, to which a polynomial 
approximation was applied to obtain the ARCNpa image. The results showed that the RCN matrix locally 
increased or decreased with increasing temperature, indicating bidirectional changes in the backscatter 
statistics. We also found that the ARCN significantly increased with the temperature, demonstrating that the 
magnitude of the variation in the probability distribution of the backscattered-signal envelope is a monotonic 
function of temperature. Unlike the phantom, tissues tended to exhibit a nonlinear dependency of the ARCN 
on the temperature that may be attributable to tissue denaturation. Especially, the ARCNpa image is highly 
suitable for visualizing the contour of the temperature distribution during microwave ablation of tissue 
samples. This study has demonstrated that temperature changes are reflected in variations in the envelope 
statistics. This novel approach makes it possible to develop an ultrasound temperature imaging method for 
simultaneously estimating the thermal dose and the tissue properties.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Hyperthermia between 40°C and 44°C has been shown to complement the efficacy of chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy in cancer treatment.1,2 One of the greatest difficulties in hyperthermia treatment is evaluating the 
thermal dose in tissues by monitoring the temperature, which is conventionally achieved by sparse and 
invasive thermocouple measurements. The treatment efficacy and quality assurance during hyperthermia 
could be markedly improved by the ability to spatially image temperature distributions.  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently a standard imaging method used to track temperature 
changes in tissues.3,4 However, its practical implementation is restricted by the associated significant capital 
investment and the need to develop compatible heating therapies. Ultrasound is a more attractive modality for 
 3 
 
5072PR, Panametrics-NDT, Waltham, MA, USA), and the received echoes were amplified and filtered by an 
amplifier and filter in the pulse/receiver. The echoes were then digitized at a sampling rate of 50 MHz by an 
analog-to-digital converter (Model PXI-5152, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) for data storage in a 
personal computer. We scanned the phantom and the porcine liver using a focused transducer with an element 
diameter of 6 mm (Model V310, Panametrics-NDT). Pulse-echo testing of the transducer revealed that its 
central frequency and pulse length were 6.5 MHz and 0.3 mm, respectively. The focal length was designed to 
be 1.1 cm, and therefore the theoretical –6 dB beam width calculated using the f-number was about 0.4 mm. 
In the experiments, measurements of the backscattered signals were carried out from 37°C to 45°C in steps of 
0.5°C. In total, 500 A-lines of backscattered signals were used to construct each image of the phantom or 
tissue. The interval between each scan line was 20 µm, and each scan line contained 2000 sampling points. 
The envelope signal of each scan line was then obtained by Hilbert transformation. Five independent 
experiments were performed on each phantom and tissue sample at each temperature. Fig. 1(b) shows typical 
B-mode images of the phantom and the porcine liver. 
 
FIG. 1. (a) Experimental setup for uniform heating of phantoms and porcine livers using a 
temperature-regulated water tank. (b) B-mode images of a phantom and porcine liver acquired by the 
single-crystal ultrasound imaging system. 
 
The experimental setup for the ablation experiments is shown in Fig. 2. The tissue sample was prepared 
from pork tenderloin taken from the psoas major muscle along the central spine. The tissue ablation was 
carried out by a microwave delivery system (UMC-1, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Institute 207 of the 
Aerospace Industry Company, Beijing, China) that operates at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and whose electrical 
power can be varied from 1 to 99 W. The tenderloin sample was preheated by a temperature-regulated water 
tank to an initial reference temperature of 37°C. The microwave antenna was then inserted for irradiation. 
Ablation treatment performed at 2 W for 420 seconds produced significant and stable temperature increases. A 
commercial ultrasound scanner (Model 2000, Terason, Burlington, MA, USA) equipped with a 7-MHz 
linear-array probe (Model 10L5, Terason) was used to acquire the image scan lines of the backscattered 
signals every 20 seconds. A pulse-echo test of the transducer showed that the pulse length was 0.7 mm. Each 
image consisted of 128 scan lines acquired at a sampling rate of 30 MHz, and the Hilbert transform was 
applied to each scan line to obtain the corresponding envelope image. Five tissue samples were measured.  
Strong reflections would be produced when the thermocouple and the microwave antenna were in close 
proximity in the pork tenderloin sample. In order to avoid such reflections influencing the data analysis, the 
thermocouple was removed from the pork tenderloin sample during image acquisition, and the temperature in 
the ablation region as a function of ablation time was independently measured from the other five tissue 
samples (containing no transducer). When using the above microwave settings we obtained the correction 
temperature curve shown in Fig. 2. As the ablation time increased the average temperature in the ablation 
region (as measured by the thermocouple) increased from the initial reference temperature to about 46.5°C.

The regional RCN, which reflects the variation in the probability distribution of the backscattered-signal 
envelopes following a temperature increase, is assigned as the new pixel located in the center of the window. 
This process is repeated with the window moving throughout the envelope image in steps of a certain number 
of pixels corresponding to a window overlap ratio of 50%, which yields the RCN matrix. The RCN matrix 
may have positive and negative values, and therefore we also took the absolute value of the RCN (ARCN) 
matrix to represent the magnitude of variations in the RCN matrix. In ablation experiments, in order to better 
illustrate the range of variations in the temperature, we additionally applied the polynomial approximation to 
the ARCN matrix (we denote as the ARCNpa image).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 4(a) and (b) show typical B-mode images and RCN matrixes of the phantom obtained at different 
temperatures. The temperature variation is difficult to detect in a conventional B-scan. However, the 
brightness of the RCN matrix gradually changed from dark to light as the temperature of the phantom 
increased. We found that the shading of the RCN matrix was interlaced with red and blue, indicating the 
simultaneous presence of positive and negative RCN values, respectively. This is quantified in Fig. 4(c), 
which plots the positive and negative RCN values as functions of temperature (n = 5). The positive RCN 
increased from 0 to 0.8 dB as the temperature increased from 37°C to 45°C, while the negative RCN 
decreased from 0 to about –0.25 dB.

ablation. We found that the RCN matrix of the pork tenderloin following the microwave ablation exhibited the 
same behavior as for those in the phantom and tissue experiments, with the brightness in the ablation region 
being temperature dependent and exhibiting the same blue-and-red interlacing. The positive RCN value 
increased from 0 to 1 dB and the negative RCN decreased from 0 to about –0.7 dB, as shown in Fig. 8(d) (n = 
5). Fig. 8(c) shows the ARCN matrixes of the tenderloin obtained at different ablation temperatures. The 
brightness of the ARCN matrix increased when the temperature increased from 37°C to 45°C, corresponding 
to the ARCN increasing from 0 to 1.5 dB, as shown in Fig. 8(e) (n = 5). This demonstrated that tissue ablation 
enlarges the degree of variation in the backscatter statistics. However, similar to the tissue experiments, the 
ARCN varied nonlinearly with temperature. The nonlinear function that would provide the best fit to the 
curve of the ARCN as a function of temperature is unclear in this stage, but we preliminarily chose a sigmoid 
function to fit the ARCN curve in Fig. 8(e), for which the correlation coefficient was 0.8. 
It is worth emphasizing that the distribution of shading in the ARCN matrix of the pork tenderloin was 
closely associated with the ablation region. Because the shading of the ARCN matrix is induced by 
temperature changes, the polynomial approximation of the ARCN matrix (i.e., the ARCNpa image) may be 
suitable for illustrating the temperature distribution during ablation. Fig. 9(a) shows the ARCNpa images 
obtained at different ablation times for a polynomial approximation of order 7. We found that the ARCNpa 
image provided an outstanding visualization of the contour and range of the temperature distribution in the 
tissue, which varied with the ablation time. Moreover, the brightness of the ARCNpa image significantly 
increased with the ablation time.  
We quantified the relationship between the ARCNpa and the ablation temperature. The ARCNpa increased 
from 0 to 1.2 dB when the temperature increased from 37°C to 45°C, as shown in Fig. 9(b) (n = 5). Fig. 9(b) 
also shows the good fit of a sigmoid model to the data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.94. This strongly 
supports that the ARCNpa value varies nonlinearly as a function of temperature for tissues during ablation. 
Moreover, the variations in both the ARCN and ARCNpa values appear to eventually reach a steady state 
during ablation.  
 
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this study we performed experiments in which uniform and nonuniform heating was applied to phantoms 
and tissues in order to explore the relationship between the temperature of the scattering medium and the 
probability distribution of the ultrasound backscattered signals. Based on analyses of the RCN matrix, we 
demonstrated that the backscatter statistics exhibit bidirectional changes when the temperature increases. We 
further found that the ARCNs for phantoms and tissues significantly increased with the temperature, 
demonstrating that the magnitude of the variation in the backscatter statistics is nearly a monotonic function in 
the temperature range from 37°C to 45°C. The main difference between the results obtained was that the 
ARCN tends to vary linearly and nonlinearly with temperature for phantoms and tissues, respectively. The 
curve fitting based on a sigmoid function clearly indicated that the ARCN eventually reached a steady state 
during tissue ablation. This may be largely attributable to the effect of tissue denaturation, and suggests that 
the probability variation of the backscatter data can be used to identify the temperature threshold at which 
there are changes in the tissue properties. Because the ARCNpa image—which is based on the polynomial 
approximation of the ARCN matrix—provides an outstanding visualization of the temperature distribution in 
a tissue following ablation, ultrasound temperature imaging based on the probability variation of backscatter 
data may allow the simultaneously estimation of the thermal dose and the tissue properties, and thereby be 
useful for guiding hyperthermia and other thermal therapies.

Abstract 
 
Ultrasonic Nakagami images can complement conventional B-mode images for characterizing scatterers 
in tissues. White noise from anechoic areas leads to artifacts that affect classification of benign and malignant 
masses. Artifact removal requires rejection of the white noise without deforming the backscattered waveform. 
Here, we propose a noise-assisted correlation algorithm (NCA) and describe computer simulations, phantom 
experiments, and clinical measurements of cysts in human breasts to validate its feasibility and practicality. 
The simulation results show that the NCA can reject white noise in an anechoic area without any deformation 
of the backscattered waveforms. The results obtained from phantoms and breast cysts further demonstrate that 
the proposed NCA can suppress a Nakagami image artifact, thus enhancing the image contrast-to-noise ratio 
but without changing the texture of the Nakagami image of the scattering background. Our findings suggest 
that the NCA should be considered an essential algorithm for artifact-free Nakagami imaging.

學術成就方面 
我們已透過仿體實驗與離體組織模式，探討超音波 Nakagami 影像與參數隨溫度變化的趨
勢。研究發現，當散射介質溫度越高，Nakagami 影像亮度與參數值越大。我們更進一步利
用微波燒灼，觀測組織燒灼過程中 Nakagami 影像的變化。結果證實，Nakagami 影像可突
顯組織燒灼區域的溫度場分佈，更可突顯溫升過程中組織變性的訊息。 
 
技術創新方面 
本計畫成果已初步了解 Nakagami 影像、組織溫度變化、與組織變性三者間的關係，實驗
結果證實，超音波 Nakagami 影像與溫度變化以及組織壞死性質皆有關聯。透過持續的發
展，Nakagami 影像有機會可以用來同時監控組織熱燒灼之溫度場以及壞死情形，以改善臨
床燒灼術的治療與預後。 
 
社會影響方面 
由於 Nakagami 影像為標準脈衝回波系統架構下的輔助性影像，因此具備未來實際應用之
機會與可能性，有助未來實現臨床組織燒灼之溫度監控與組織變性同步偵測新技術開發。
特別是目前國內已開始自主發展醫用超音波工業的同時，本計畫的執行將為本土醫療器材
發展帶來新的觀點與思維。
