Abstract
We analytically solve the cardinal functions of two-point Hermite interpolation
by the complex trigonometric polynomials. These functions are fundamental to FIR
filers with flat constraint at two frequency points because the frequency responses
can be explicitly expressed by a weighting sum of cardinal functions. The weighting
coefficients are exactly the derivatives at the frequency points. That is, we provide
an efficient way for designing and synthesizing FIR filters with flat constraints.
We also reveal the fact that the impulse responses of any FIR maximally-flat filters
are closely related to the binomial coefficients and the Stirling numbers of the
first kind. The proposed method is very general and can be applied to solving the
cardinal functions of multi-point Hermite interpolation.
Keywords: Hermite interpolation, Stirling numbers of the first kind, Maximally-flat

1 Introduction
Function approximation is a classical and fundamental problem in mathematics and
widely studied theoretically and applied practically in engineering. Digital filter
design is a typical approximation problem in digital signal processing. In the
approximation theory, interpolation is oldest and simplest. There are huge amount
of literature including papers, monographs, or chapters in books on interpolation.
Although the theories and methods of interpolation are well developed in the approx-
imation theory, some of the key concepts are not applied systematically in signal
processing.

2 Cardinal Functions of FIR Filters
To solve the two-point interpolation problem by the complex trigonometric polynomials,
one approach is to substitute (1) for (2). We obtain the following system of linear
equations
N∑
n=0
(−jn)kie−jnωihn = diki , 0 ≤ ki ≤ Ki, i = 0, 1.
The equations can be solved analytically or numerically. This approach may be
effective if dik are known but is hardly to find a general solution for arbitrary dik
. In this paper, we will solve this problem based on the method of Lagrange. This
method solves (2) by representing the solution as
H(ejω) =
K0∑
k0=0
d0k0H¯0k0(e
jω) +
K1∑
k1=0
d1k1H¯1k1(e
jω). (3)
where H¯ik(ejω) are fundamental functions, or called the cardinal functions, of this
Hermite interpolation problem. The cardinal functions satisfy the following cardinal
property
H¯
(ℓi)
0k (e
jωi) = δkℓiδ0i, 0 ≤ k ≤ K0 (4)
H¯
(ℓi)
1k (e
jωi) = δkℓiδ1i, 0 ≤ k ≤ K1 (5)
for 0 ≤ ℓi ≤ Ki, i = 0 or 1. The Kronecker symbol δkℓ = 1 if k = ℓ and δkℓ = 0 if k 6= ℓ.
It is worth noting that (3) can be used not only for the synthesis of MF FIR
filters, but also for the design of FIR filters with flatness constraint if we
regards some dk’s as free variables. Refer to [9] for designing the partial-flat
lowpass filters by two-point Hermite interpolation with flat constraints at ω0 = 0
and ω1 = pi. However, in this paper we only discuss the synthesis of MF filters.
Suppose that H¯ik(ejω) are represented by
H¯ik(e
jω) =
N∑
n=0
h¯ikne
−jnω. (6)
By substituting (6) for (4) and (5), we have
N∑
n=0
(−jn)ℓie−jnωih¯0kn = δkℓiδ0i, , 0 ≤ k ≤ K0
N∑
n=0
(−jn)ℓie−jnωih¯1kn = δkℓiδ1i, 0 ≤ k ≤ K1.

Property 1 If both a(u) and b(u) are analytical in a neighborhood of u = 0, then
b(u)TK{a(u)/b(u)} − TK{a(u)} = O(uK+1). ¥
The proof of this property is straightforward and is omitted here. Let b(u) =
(u−u1)K1+1, a(u) = [f(u)−f(0)]k/k!, K = K0, and h(u) = TK0{[f(u)−f(0)]k/k!(u−u1)−K1−1}.
Recall that g(u) = TK0{[f(u)− f(0)]k/k!}. By property 1, we have
(u− u1)K1+1h(u)− g(u) = O(uK0+1).
From the above equation and (9), we deduce that
(u− u1)K1+1h(u)− 1
k!
[f(u)− f(0)]k = O (uK0+1) . (11)
From our previous discussion, we conclude that
H¯0k(e
jω) = (u− u1)K1+1h(u)
∣∣
u=fˆ(ω)
.
It is worth noting that the choice of function ω = f(u) may be restricted much
more besides the basic requirement of ω0 = f(0). For example, we need not only that
u is a function of ω, but also that u is a function of e−jω for facilitating the
design of causal digital filters.
During the above discussion, we presented our method of solving the two systems
of linear eq1uations (4) and (5). Here we go into the detail. The key point is the
choice of the mapping functions. For solving (4), we use the mapping u = e−j(ω−ω0)− 1
since H¯0k(ejω) is a complex trigonometric polynomial. The inverse mapping is ω =
ω0 + j ln(1 + u) ≡ p(u). It is clear that p(0) = ω0. Let u1 = e−j(ω1−ω0) − 1. On another
hand, To solve (5), we use the mapping v = e−j(ω−ω1) − 1 whose inverse function is
ω = ω0 + j ln(1 + u) ≡ q(v). We also have q(0) = ω1. Let v0 = e−j(ω1−ω0) − 1.
Property 2 The cardinal functions that satisfy (4) and (5) are expressed by
H¯0k(e
jω) = (u− u1)K1+1p(u)
∣∣
u=e−j(ω−ω0)−1
H¯1k(e
jω) = (v − v0)K0+1q(v)
∣∣
v=e−j(ω−ω1)−1
where u1 = e−j(ω1−ω0) − 1, v0 = e−j(ω0−ω1) − 1,
p(u) =
jk
k!
TK0{(u− u1)−K1−1 lnk(1 + u)},
q(v) =
jk
k!
T ′K1{(v − v0)−K0−1 lnk(1 + v)} ¥

observe that the approximation by H¯k(ejω) around ω0 is better than around ω1 since
H¯k(e

Example 3. FIR lowpass filters with fractional delay. In this example we consider the
problem of designing MF FIR lowpass filters with fractional delay τ in the passband
[5]. The frequency response approximates e−jτω around ω0 = 0 and approximate 0 around
ω1 = pi. Let the filter order N = K0 + K1 + 1 where K0 and K1 are the number of
derivatives to be interpolated at ω0 and ω1, respectively. We have d0k = (−jτ)k for
0 ≤ k ≤ K0 and d1k = 0 for 0 ≤ k ≤ K1. By the general solution in (2), We have
u = e−jω − 1, u1 = −2,
