英文摘要 
Channel estimation and equalization for single-input 
multiple–output (SIMO) orthogonal frequency-division 
multiplexing (OFDM) systems without cyclic prefix (CP) are 
investigated in this paper. The OFDM system without CP 
provides high spectral efficiency at the cost of sacrificing simple 
one-tap equalization. Due to the block Toeplitz structure of 
channel matrix, the subspace channel estimation with block 
matrix scheme is first developed. The block matrix scheme 
increases the number of sample vectors and thus reduces the 
perturbation of sample correlation matrix. The 
frequency-domain ISI/ICI-free equalizers are then designed by 
suppressing the inter-symbol interferences (ISI) and 
inter-carrier interferences (ICI) completely. Compared with 
existing methods, the proposed channel estimation and 
equalization yield good performances in the finite sample 
scenario. 
 
Keywords: Blind channel estimation, Cyclic prefix, 
SIMO-OFDM systems, GSC equalizer. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Due to high spectral efficiency, low complexity and 
robustness to frequency selective fading, orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been receiving 
much attention in the high-data-rate wireless communications 
for the past years [1]-[3]. A cyclic prefix (CP) longer than the 
channel delay spread is usually inserted at the transmitter, in 
which the OFDM converts the frequency selective channel into 
parallel flat-faded subchannels. Each subchannel output will 
suffer from a complex multiplicative distortion and can be 
compensated by a one-tap equalizer [4]. For example, OFDM 
systems are extensively adopted in wideband communication 
systems such as digital audio broadcasting (DAB) [5], digital 
video broadcasting (DVB) [6], broadband wireless local area 
networks (WLAN) [7][8] and broadband wireless access 
standard [9].  
Though the insertion of CP will eliminate both inter-symbol 
interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) effectively, 
it causes considerable loss in the bandwidth efficiency. In IEEE 
802.11a standard, for example, this is a quarter of an OFDM 
symbol duration [7]. To increase the bandwidth efficiency, 
blind channel estimation of the OFDM system without CP has 
been widely investigated recently. For instance, the linear 
smoothing channel estimation for OFDM system without CP is 
examined in [10] and the block linear smoothing channel 
estimation is further investigated in [11]. Roy and Li [12] 
propose the subspace channel estimation of OFDM systems 
without CP for ISI-free environment. By precoding OFDM 
symbols with different lengths, cyclostationarity is induced in 
the OFDM system and the frequency domain subspace channel 
estimation is presented in [13]. Blind channel estimations for 
OFDM systems with and without CP are compared in [14]. A 
feature-suppressed OFDM system with the elimination of the 
CP and pilot tones is proposed in [15] to provide the robust 
channel estimation and ISI cancellation.  
The key contribution of this paper is the subspace channel 
estimation with block matrix scheme and the adaptive equalizer 
for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) OFDM systems 
without CP. The block matrix scheme is first proposed for 
 4
H  in (6) is a full column rank matrix if NM N L   where 
2M   suffices to satisfy the necessary condition when N>>L. 
Using the signal model in (4), the blind subspace channel 
estimators are presented in the next section. 
III. BLIND SUBSPACE CHANNEL ESTIMATORS 
The subspace channel estimator for OFDM systems without 
cyclic prefix is first developed by Roy and Li [12], where only 
the ISI-free samples in yi are used for channel estimation. 
Unlike the scheme in [12], the ISI samples in iy  are not 
ignored in this paper.  
 
A. SUBSPACE (SS) METHOD 
Using (4), the ensemble autocorrelation matrix 
H
y i iE    R y y  is computed by 
2 2 2H H H
y i i n s nE        R H x x H I HH I      (7) 
where 2n  and 2s  are the noise power and the signal power, 
respectively, and the second equality comes from the fact that 
2H H H
i i N i i N sE E        x x F s s F I . Performing the 
eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition (EVD) on yR  yields 
  2H Hy s s s n n n  R U U U U            (8) 
where s  is a diagonal matrix consisting of ( )N L  
eigenvalues larger than 2n , sU  is a ( )MN N L   matrix 
containing the orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to 
eigenvalues in s , nU  contains the orthonormal eigenvectors 
corresponding to the eigenvalue 2n . sU  has the same range 
space as H  and is thus referred to as the signal subspace, 
whereas the range space of nU  corresponds to the noise 
subspace. Using the orthogonal property between signal 
subspace and noise subspace, it is found that  
  0Hn U H                  (9) 
Let ku  be the k-th column of nU  and partition ku  into an 
1N   block vector

where ( ) ,  0,1, , 1Mk i C i N  u  . Exploiting the block 
Toeplitz structure of H, (9) can be expressed by alternative 
form

However, the perturbation of noise subspace in the finite 
sample scenario destroys the orthogonal property in (11), i.e., 
0Hk hU . Under this circumstance, the channel estimation can 
be replaced by the constrained least square optimization 
criterion

B. SUBSPACE METHOD WITH BLOCK MATRIX SCHEME 
(BLOCK-SS) 
The block matrix scheme has been presented to enhance the 
linear smoothing channel estimation for OFDM systems [11]. 
This scheme can be also applied to subspace channel estimation 
here. Because of the block Toeplitz structure of H in (6), H can 
be expressed by

where   ( ), ( ), , ( 1 ) T G Li g x iN L g x iN G g C       x  . 
The channel matrix GH  can be identified up to a scalar if and 
only if the matrix GH  has a full column rank [23]. In order to 
guarantee that  GH  is of full column rank, a necessary 
condition for G is chosen so that there are more rows than 
columns, where the minimum of G is calculated by 
min ( )1
LG ceil
M

where ( )ceil x  denotes the nearest integer greater than or 
equal to x. Hence, the value of G  is bounded by

TH T M H T
ISI N N N N   H F H F F H F , and ni is the noise 
vector.  
With the frequency-domain signal vector in (26), the 
GSC-based linear equalizer [21] including FA-GSC and 
PA-GSC implementations has been presented for symbol 
detection. The GSC equalizer contains a fixed branch which is 
comprised of the matrix D and an adaptive branch which 
consists of the orthogonal complement of D followed by the 
adaptive weight matrix. The fixed branch acts as a matched 
filter which passes the desired signal corrupted by a residual of 
interference plus noise. On the other hand, the orthogonal 
complement of D, called the blocking matrix, removes the 
desired signal while extract the interference components in 
(26), which is used to cancel the residual interferences in the 
fixed branch by properly adjusting the adaptive weight matrix. 
However, since the interference components in the adaptive 
branch contain the coherent interference, the signal 
cancellation will be happened in finding the adaptive weight 
matrix [24]. A two-stage ISI-free MV equalizer consisting of 
the ISI-free transformation followed by the minimum variance 
(MV) filter is mentioned in [21] to combat the coherent 
interferences. Let V be the orthogonal complement of ISIH , 
i.e., ( )MN MN LC  V  and H ISI V H 0 . The output signal of 
ISI-free transformation is then given by 
,
H H H
i V i i i  z V z V Ds V n          (27) 
After removing the ISI and coherent interferences by the 
ISI-free transformation, the symbol detection is performed by 
the MV filter, in which the weight matrix is calculated by 
1 H

W R V D                 (28) 
where , ,

In this section, a number of equalizers are proposed in the 
following to overcome the signal cancellation problem with 
better performance than the ISI-free MV equalizer. 
 
A. ISI/ICI-free MV equalizer 
The ISI-free equalizer removes the ISI and coherent 
interferences. However, it may increase ICI interferences 
because the columns of D in (27) are orthogonal while those of 
HV D  aren’t. Instead of using MV filter in (28), we use 
ICI-free constrained MV filter to reduce the ICI effect. The 
ICI-free constrained MV filter generates the weight matrix by 
the following criterion

The constraints in (29) impose a unit gain on the desired 
subcarrier and zero gains on the other ones. The solution of (29) 
is given by 
  11 1 H H HICI free MV zV zV   W R V D D VR V D      (30)

If the correlation matrix zVR  is replaced by the sample 
correlation matrix 1 , ,0
ˆ (1/ ) K HzV i V i ViK

 R z z , both the ISI-free 
and ISI/ICI-free MV equalizers will suffer from the finite 
sample effects. Since the channel information is known after 
the channel estimation is performed, the equalizer can be 
designed by an ISI/ICI-free transformation followed by a 
matched filter. Let dk be the k-th column of D, Dk be the matrix 
removing dk from D, [  ]k k ISID D H  and kV be the 
orthogonal complement of kD . The ISI/ICI-free 
transformation for the k-th subcarrier is then designed by  kV , 
which generates the output signal by

,i kz  in (31) can be viewed as a desired symbol ( )is k  
corrupted by AWGN noise. Consequently, in the end, the 
matched filter Hk kV d  is used to detect the desired symbol. For 
BPSK signal scheme, for example, the decisions are computed 
by

C. DL-based MV equalizer 
In addition the proposed ISI/ICI-free MV/MF equalizers, the 
diagonal loading (DL) approach [25[26] is often used to 
enhance the performance of MV equalizer in a finite sample 
scenario. The DL-based MV equalizer replaces RzV in (28) and 
(30) with the DL-based correlation matrix RDL=RzV +λI where 
λ is the diagonal loading factor. The performance improvement 
by the DL-based equalizer is evaluated by the following 
computer simulations.

VI. CONCLUSION 
The block-SS channel estimator and ISI/ICI-free equalizers 
for SIMO OFDM systems without CP are proposed in this 
paper. The block-SS channel estimator utilizes the block 
Toeplitz structure of channel matrix to increase equivalent 
samples and thus decreases the RMSE of channel estimation. 
With the estimated channels, two-stage ISI/ICI-free equalizers 
are presented. In the finite sample scenario, the ISI/ICI-free 
transformation followed by the matched filter outperforms the 
other equalizers and obtains a BER close to the time-domain 
MMSE equalizer.
