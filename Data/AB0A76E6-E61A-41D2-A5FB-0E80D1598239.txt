SUMMARY
An approximation approach of seismic analysis of two-way asymmetric building systems under bi-
directional seismic ground motions is proposed. The procedures of uncoupled modal response history anal-
ysis (UMRHA) are extended to two-way asymmetric buildings simultaneously excited by two horizontal
components of ground motion. Constructing the relationships of two-way base shears versus two-way roof
translations and base torque versus roof rotation in ADRS format for a two-way asymmetric building, each
modal pushover curve bifurcates into three curves in an inelastic state. A three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF)
modal stick is developed to simulate the modal pushover curve with the stated bifurcating characteristic.
It requires the calculation of the synthetic earthquake and angle . It is confirmed that the 3DOF modal
stick is consistent with single-degree-of-freedom modal stick in an elastic state. A two-way asymmetric
three-story building was analyzed by UMRHA procedure incorporating the proposed 3DOF modal sticks.
The analytical results are compared with those obtained from nonlinear response history analysis. It is
shown that the 3DOF modal sticks are more rational and effective in dealing with the assessment of
two-way asymmetric building systems under two-directional seismic ground motions. Copyright q 2007

sections of this paper provides a solution of the stated situation.
Bifurcating characteristics of pushover curves for asymmetric structures
In this paper, the plane-asymmetric building systems with center of stiffness (CR) and CM not
coincident in both plane axial directions and subjected to bi-directional seismic ground motions
are considered. The direction of gravity is opposite to the direction of the Y -axis. Under the
excitation of the nth modal inertial force distribution applied to the original building system, there
are three pushover curves available. They are the relationships of two base shears versus two roof
translations at CM and base torque versus roof rotation. Let
Dxn = uxn,r
xn,r
, Dzn = uzn,r
zn,r
, Dn = un,rn,r
(10)
where subscript r stands for the roof component of displacement vector or mode shape in a specific
direction (x , z or ) and subscript n stands for the nth mode. With Equation (10), the nth modal
displacement can be defined as follows:
un(t)=
⎡⎢⎣
uxn Dxn(t)
uzn Dzn(t)
un Dn(t)
⎤⎥⎦ (11)
Due to Dxn = Dzn = Dn = Dn for proportionally damped elastic structures, Equation (11) is equal
to un(t)=un Dn(t), which is shown in Equation (5). The relationships of Dxn , Dzn and Dn for an
asymmetric building under the pushover using the nth modal inertia force distribution is depicted
in Figure 1(a). The thick line shown in Figure 1(a) represents the real relationship of Dxn , Dzn
and Dn , which deviates from the thin line representing Dxn = Dzn = Dn . It shows that Dxn , Dzn

Substituting the above equations into Equation (14), it can be found that Axn = Azn = An =.
Let Axn = Azn = An = An . Consequently, the relationships of forces and deformations of two-way
asymmetric buildings under the excitation of the nth modal inertia force distribution shall be
represented by three curves in ADRS format, namely Dxn versus An , Dzn versus An and Dn
versus An .
Establish 3DOF modal sticks
A 3DOF modal stick with a lumped mass eccentrically located is depicted in Figure 1(b). The
relationships of forces and deformations of the noted 3DOF modal stick are expected to represent
those of the nth mode of the original building structure. The beam of the 3DOF modal stick is rigid,
and the lengths projected on the X–Y plane and Z–Y plane are equal to ex and ez , respectively.
The beam is connected to the column by a Y -directional rotational spring whose stiffness is equal
to k. The column of the 3DOF modal stick is rigid, the length equal to one and connected with
the ground by two rotational springs. The stiffness of the two rotational springs at the column base
are kx and kz . The rotational spring with stiffness kz is in alignment with the X -axis. There is an
angle  between the Z -axis and the other rotational spring with stiffness kx . Since the stiffness
sub-matrices kxz and kzx shown in Equation (2) are not necessarily equal to 0, the purpose of the
stated angle  is to correlate the X - and Z -translational displacements with the Z - and X -axial
shear forces, respectively. It is shown in the following derivation that the angle  is equal to zero,
i.e. the direction of the noted rotational spring will be in alignment with Z -axis, only when kxz
and kzx are equal to 0. The masses, mx ,mz , and mass moment of inertia, I , are concentrated at the
end of the beam as shown in Figure 1(b). The 3DOF modal stick has only three independent DOFs
which are defined as the X - and Z -directional translation and Y -directional rotation at the lumped
mass. The displacement vector, mass matrix and stiffness matrix of the 3DOF modal stick are

where C =cos and S =sin. If  is approximately zero, i.e. the rotational spring with stiffness
equal to kx almost align the Z -axis, the stiffness matrix of the 3DOF modal stick is simplified as

Equation (26) shows that the angle  is resulted from the stiffness sub-matrix kzx . In general,
when the principal axes of all columns are arranged in accordance with the global coordinates, the
elements of sub-matrix kzx will be small compared with other elements of the stiffness matrix K.
From Equation (26), it can be obtained that the value of angle  will be small in most cases. If 
is approximately zero, the stiffness of rotational springs and eccentricities shown in Equation (26)
could be further simplified as
kx =uTxnkxxuxn, kz =uTznkzzuzn, k=uTnkun −

(27)
It should be noted that the influence vector, shown in Equation (24), implies that the synthetic
ground acceleration is simultaneously applied to the 3DOF modal stick in all translational and
rotational directions. The key point of constructing the 3DOF modal stick lies in finding the angle
 which is the angle between the Z -axis and the rotational spring having a stiffness kx . The stated
angle takes the coupling term of the 3×3 modal stiffness matrix, uTxnkxzuzn , into account. When
the stated angle is equal to 0◦, it implies that there is no coupling in the two horizontal axes. With
the six known values of the 3×3 modal stiffness matrix, the six unknown terms of the 3DOF
modal stick, including the noted angle, ex , ez , kx , kz and k, can be exactly determined.
The equation of motion for the original multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) building is the
description of the motion at the lumped masses. The translational motion at the CM for an
asymmetric building consists of two parts. One is the translation at the CR and the other is the
rotation of the rigid floor diaphragm. The 3DOF modal equation of motion, Equation (23), is a
further decomposition of the conventional SDOF modal equation of motion into a set of three
coupled equations. The 3DOF modal stick, which corresponds to the 3DOF modal equation of
motion, explicitly presents the rotational motion contributing to the total translations at the lumped
mass of the modal stick. The Appendix provides the proof that one of the three modes of the
3DOF modal stick, denoted as active sub-mode, is identical to the mode of the SDOF modal stick
and the other two, denoted as spurious sub-mode, are trivial, i.e. no contribution to the elastic
dynamic modal response. Thus, the 3DOF modal stick does not violate the fundamental principle
of structural dynamics. From the development of the two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) modal stick
[1], it may be intuitive to expect that the 3DOF modal stick consists of only one active sub-mode
and two spurious sub-modes. However, the verification of the stated property has been found
impossible to directly extend from that established for the 2DOF modal sticks [1]. In this paper, a
completely new approach based on the principle of energy conservation is adopted and presented
in the Appendix.
Inelastic properties of 3DOF modal stick
In an inelastic state, Equation (23) becomes

The restoring force, Rn , is a 3×1 column vector. From the three nth modal pushover curves,
i.e. Dxn versus An, Dzn versus An and Dn versus An , the three post-yielding stiffness ratios

(36)
It can be found from Equations (35) and (36) that k′x and k′z are functions of k′. In other words,
the inelastic stiffnessess of the three springs are dependent. The yielding moments of the rotational
springs, My, Myx and Myz , can be determined as follows:
Myx = Axnymx , Myz = Aznymz
My = Any I + Axnymx ez − Aznymzex
(37)
The six parameters of the three bi-linear rotational springs used in a 3DOF modal stick are
determined by Equations (34)–(37). Up to this point, the 3DOF modal stick has been completely
established.
The concept of ‘vibrating mode’ which originated from the elastic system is only an approx-
imation for inelastic systems. This so-called vibration mode is time variant which could change
from time to time during the inelastic vibration. The ‘modal analysis’ of inelastic structures is only
an approximation approach. There are three pushover curves available for each inelastic ‘mode’
of a two-way asymmetric building. The bifurcation of each ‘modal’ pushover curve in an inelastic
state is due to the nonproportional deformations of roof translations and roof rotation. The 3DOF
modal stick with explicitly rotational motion is able to simultaneously simulate the noted three
pushover curves. It is natural and reasonable to have the 3DOF modal stick represent the inelastic
‘mode’ in which three bifurcated pushover curves exist. There would be a dilemma encountered in
using SDOF modal stick of choosing only one of the three stated pushover curves to represent the
inelastic ‘mode’, especially when the mode is rotational dominant or highly coupled in the three
directions. The proposed 3DOF modal stick is able to avoid the mentioned dilemma and takes the
translation–rotation interaction into consideration.

The seismic ground motion records considered in this verification are the sine wave with period
of vibration equal to 1 s (Figures 2(c) and (d)) and the NS and EW components of 1940 El Centro
earthquake (Figures 2(d) and (e)). The sine wave with peak ground acceleration (PGA) equal to
0.8g and 0.5g applied along the X - and Z -direction, respectively. The NS and EW components
of 1940 El Centro earthquake are applied along the X - and Z -direction, respectively. The NS
and EW components of 1940 El Centro earthquake are amplified with the same scaling factor
equal to 2.29 and the PGA of each component is equal to 0.8g and 0.49g, respectively. The
applied analytical methodologies are UMRHA incorporating 3DOF modal stick (3DMPA) and
nonlinear response history analysis (RHA). All the analysis are carried out using PISA3D computer
program [9] which can provide the feature of inputting ground acceleration records not only in
translation but also in rotation. From Table I, it can be found that the prototype building is a
torsionally flexible building. The analysis of a torsionally stiff building using 3DMPA can be found
in Lin [10].
Summary of analytical results
The step-by-step procedures are summarized for the proposed method using the aforementioned
analytical example:
1. Compute the elastic properties of the building, including the vibration periods of mode,
the mode shapes and the modal participation masses. The elastic properties of the example
building are shown in Table I. It shows that the accumulation of the modal participation
mass up to the 6th mode is over 90% in all three directions. Therefore, only the 1st to the
6th mode will be considered in this analytical example.
2. Apply Equation (4) and compute the synthetic seismic ground motions, xnu¨gx (t)+
znu¨gz(t), for each mode.
3. Apply Equation (26) and compute the elastic properties for each 3DOF modal sticks. The
properties of 3DOF modal sticks for the 1st to the 6th mode are shown in Table II. The
detailed analytical results of the sub-modal properties for each 3DOF modal stick are listed in

the original building. The mode shapes of the active sub-modes are all equal to [1 1 1]T.
The modal participation mass, ˜2 M˜ , of the active and the spurious sub-mode is equal
to 1 and 0, respectively.
4. Apply Equations (10) and (14) and compute the first n pushover curves by applying the
sn defined in Equation (7) to the original MDOF building. The components of sn vectors
for the first three modes are given in Table IV. It is noted that the values of the rotational
components of s1 are more pronounced than other translational components.
In order to accurately represent the modal force–deformation relationships for each modal stick,
one-cycle push–pull is substituted for conventional pushover. The one-cycle push–pull curves
for the first three modes are shown as thin lines in Figure 3. It can be found that the three
hysteretic loops of each mode of the original MDOF building are bifurcated after the mode becomes
inelastic.
5. Idealize the pushover curves obtained from step 4 as bi-linear curves. Apply Equations
(34)–(37) and compute the inelastic properties for each 3DOF modal stick.

7. Apply Equations (23) and (11) and conduct the response time history analysis for each 3DOF
modal stick. In this paper, instead of conducting an inelastic seismic analysis immediately,
an elastic dynamic analysis is carried out first. This is to illustrate the accuracy of the
3DMPA for this building subjected to the low-intensity ground accelerations and remained
in the elastic range. The two sine wave ground accelerations shown in Figures 2(c) and (d)
are both scaled down to PGA=0.01g for the elastic seismic analysis. The analytical roof
deformations are shown in Figure 4. It confirms that the 3DMPA is identical to the elastic
modal response time history analysis. The time history analysis of the 3DOF modal sticks
subjected to the sine waves (PGA=0.8g and 0.5g) and El Centro earthquakes (PGA=0.8g
and 0.49g) is subsequently carried out (Figure 5). It is evident in Figures 5(a), (b), (d) and
(e) that the three curves are no longer identical. It is concluded that the responses of the 1st
and 2nd modal sticks have become inelastic under the noted ground motions. Since the 3rd
mode is essentially elastic, the three components of the 3rd 3DOF modal stick, i.e. D˜x , D˜z
and D˜, are equal to each other as evidenced in Figures 5(c) and (f). The rest of the modal
sticks all remain elastic (not shown). Therefore, only the force–deformation relationships for
the 1st–3rd modes of the prototype building and the corresponding 3DOF modal sticks are
shown in Figure 3.
8. Apply Equations (5); the response time history of the original MDOF building is obtained
using the arithmetic summation of the modal response time histories. The translational and
rotational displacements at CM on the roof of the original building subjected to the sine
waves and El Centro earthquakes obtained by 3DMPA and nonlinear RHA are shown in
Figure 6. From Figures 6(a)–(f), it is confirmed that the 3DMPA can satisfactorily predict
the peak responses and residual displacements. Except the response history of Z -directional
translation shown in Figure 6(e) is somewhat offset from those obtained by RHA.
Further analysis (not shown in this paper) shows that the error of the maximum response is
increased as the intensity of the input ground motion increases. Further analysis also shows that
the error of the maximum response is increased as the major component of ground motion applied
to the weak direction of the building. However, since the frequency contents of earthquakes and
the corresponding nonlinear characteristics of the structures (shifting of vibration frequency) could
vary from earthquake to earthquake, the effects of the earthquake intensity on the accuracy of the
proposed method should be investigated based on the statistics for a set of buildings excited by
an ensemble of ground motions. Since UMRHA method appears not limited for the analysis of
buildings with irregular elevation or weak-column strong-beam mechanism, the 3DMPA should
have no such restriction either.
CONCLUSION
The bifurcation of pushover curves for asymmetric structures subjected to the modal inertia force
distribution sn is stated. Hence, the application of conventional SDOF modal sticks is insufficient to
assess the inelastic modal behaviors, which are used to calculate the inelastic seismic responses of
the asymmetric structure. The 3DOF modal equations of motion for two-way asymmetric buildings
are developed. Each 3DOF modal equation of motion has a corresponding 3DOF modal stick.
The 3DOF modal stick is consistent with the SDOF modal stick in an elastic state and has the
mentioned bifurcating characteristic in an inelastic state. The proposed 3DMPA approach is able

which is the same as the left-hand side of Equation (A9). Therefore, the right-hand side of
Equation (A10) should be equal to that of Equation (A9), i.e.
DTn (M˜D¨n +C˜D˙n +K˜Dn)=En (A12)
The displacement vector of a 3DOF stick can be expressed as
D˜=Dn =
⎡⎢⎣
Dxn
Dzn
Dn
⎤⎥⎦= u˜aqa+u˜s1qs1+u˜s2qs2 (A13)
where qa, qs1 and qs2 are the modal coordinates of active sub-mode, the first spurious sub-mode
and the second spurious sub-mode, respectively. Substituting Equation (A13) into the right-hand
side of Equation (A10) and using the orthogonal properties of mode shapes, it can be obtained
that
DTn (M˜D¨n +C˜D˙n +K˜Dn)=Ea+Es1+Es2 (A14a)
where
Ea = u˜Ta (M˜u˜aq¨a+C˜u˜aq˙a+K˜u˜aqa)qa (A14b)
Es1 = u˜Ts1(M˜u˜s1q¨s1+C˜u˜s1q˙s1+K˜u˜s1qs1)qs1 (A14c)
Es2 = u˜Ts2(M˜u˜s2q¨s2+C˜u˜s2q˙s2+K˜u˜s2qs2)qs2 (A14d)
From Equations (A12) and (A14a), it can be obtained that
En =Ea+Es1+Es2 (A15)
Since the circular frequency 2a and the mode shape u˜a of the active sub-mode are equal to 2n
and [1 1 1]T, respectively, the virtual work done by the active sub-mode, Ea, is equal to En .
Therefore, from Equation (A15), the virtual work done by the two spurious sub-modes, Es1 and
Es2, should be equal to zero. Thus, it can be concluded that the two spurious sub-modes have
no contribution to the elastic responses of a 3DOF modal stick.
Consequently, it is proved that the active sub-mode is the same as the nth mode of the orig-
inal building and the spurious sub-modes have no contribution to the elastic modal response.
This confirms that the 3DOF modal stick derived from Equations (19)–(27) does not violate the
fundamental theory of dynamics for elastic systems.
