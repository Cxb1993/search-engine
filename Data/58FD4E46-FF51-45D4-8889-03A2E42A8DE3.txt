二、英文摘要 
The device properties of linear-grade gate 
barrier high-performance heterostructure field 
effect transistors are comprehensively 
analyzed and demonstrated. Based on the 
variations of mole fraction of Schottky layer 
with InGaAs/GaAs/InGaAs channel layer, the 
DC and RF characteristics are compared and 
studied. Due to the employed InGaAs 
structure and Schottky behaviors of InGaP 
“insulator”, good pinch-off and saturation 
characteristics, higher and linear 
transconductance, and good RF performances 
are obtained. On the other hand, by using a 
spin-on-glass (SOG) film, and the photoresist 
re-flow, a sub-micron gate length of 0.8μm 
can be reliably fabricated. Thus, the 
direct-current and microwave performance of 
the studied device with gate lengths of 1 and 
0.8μm has been evaluated. The maximum 
transconductance from 218mS/mm for 1μm 
gate length to 221mS/mm for 0.8μm gate 
length are obtained. The output current, 
defined at VGS=1.2V, from 380mA/mm for 
1μm gate length to 434mA/mm for 0.8μm 
gate length are obtained. High-speed device 
operation has been verified, with fT of 15GHz 
and fmax of 31GHz for 0.8μm gate length.  
 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
For obtaining more power gain and 
 3
n+-GaAs cap layer is removed. Then, we spin 
the spin-on-glass (SOG) on the sample in 
5000 rpm for 35 seconds and bake it in oven 
at 110oC for 2 hours. After that, we define the 
gate window with 1 m and re　 -flow the 
photoresist by baking the sample on the hot 
plate at 140  for 1 minute. The sub℃ -micron 
gate window with gate length of Lg=0.8 m is 　
obtained. Using a buffered oxide etching 
(BOE) to etch the SOG film to form an 
undercut window and the gate Schottky 
contact is achieved by evaporating Au metal 
on the undoped In0.49Ga0.51P layer. Finally, 
using BOE to etch SOG and then we 
accomplish the sub-micron gate. The 
employed InGaAs double delta-doped channel 
structure can effectively increase the total 
thickness of channel layer without decreasing 
the In mole fraction. In addition, the 
delta-doped sheets in quantum wells as 
channel layers not only provide better carrier 
confinement but also exhibit lower impurity 
scattering effect and higher electron velocity. 
Moreover, as compared with AlGaAs, the 
wide-gap and linear-grade InGaP material as a 
gate “insulator” takes advantages of low 
deep-level center density and low reactivity 
with oxygen to improve Schottky behaviors. 
The upper In0.49Ga0.51P layer provides good 
Schottky characteristics and the lower 
In0.49Ga0.51P layer can suppress the substrate 
leakage current through the substrate leakage 
path. Furthermore, the larger conduction band 
discontinuity at the InGaP/InGaAs 
heterointerface ( E　 C~0.38 eV) offers the 
better carrier confinement in the InGaAs 
channel layers even operated at higher 
forward gate bias regime. Presumably, good 
device properties of low leakage current, good 
pinch-off and saturation characteristics, high 
and linear transconductance and microwave 
performances can be obtained. 
 
五、實驗結果與討論 
The experimental results of typical common 
source output I-V characteristics of studied 
device are shown in Fig.3(a), (b) with 1 and 
0.8μm gate length . Clearly, due to the 
graded Schottky barrier height and good 
carrier confinement, the maximum 
drain-source operation voltage is about 20V 
without significant gate leakage current at 
VGS=1.2V at 480K for both devices. In 
addition, the so-called parallel conduction 
which frequently observed in traditional 
HEMTs, are not found in our device. This 
indicated that the employed linear graded 
barrier and double channel structure indeed 
play an important role in device behaviors. 
Fig. 3(a), (b) explain the common source I-V 
characteristics of the studied device with 1 
and 0.8 μ m gate length at various 
temperatures. General knowledge, as the 
temperature is increased, lowing effect of 
Schottky barrier height and the increase of 
background carrier concentration result in the 
additional leakage paths through the buffer 
and “insulator” layers. Thus, poor carrier 
confinement associated with degraded 
pinch-off and saturation characteristics are 
found. However, all output I-V curves of the 
studied device show good pinch-off and 
saturation characteristics. 
Fig. 4 illustrates the drain saturation 
current IDS and transconductance gm versus 
gate-source voltage VGS at various 
temperature. The biased voltage is fixed at 
VDS=1.2V. The gm,max values of 1 (0.8)μm 
gate length at various temperatures 
(300K~480K) are 218 (221), 211 (214), 206 
(203), and 194 (197)mS/mm, respectively. 
Fig. 5 shows the microwave 
characteristics of the studied device with 
Lg=0.8 and 1 μ m at room temperature
