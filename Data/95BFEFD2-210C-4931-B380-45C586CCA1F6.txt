2[4]，直在到今日，這些重要議題的相關研究
仍持續蓬勃發展當中。由於無線寬頻傳輸需
要高速的傳輸速率與良好的可靠性，現階段
多以正交分頻多工(OFDM)傳輸架構實現，
OFDM 系統必須具備高效能的通道估測技
術，因此，我們設計以徑向基底網路為基礎
的通道估測技術，同時，在不提昇太大複雜
度的前題下，利用參數內插的方式提昇以徑
向基底網路為基礎的通道估測效能，並且結
合通道估測與通道解碼，利用通道解碼所產
生的資訊，來幫助通道估測更準確的估測。
三、研究步驟
藉由過去的文獻探討，我們瞭解到將通
道等化/估測與通道解碼結合，可以利用解碼
後的資訊幫助通道估測得到更好的訊號偵
測，而得到更好的訊號偵測後再經通道解
碼，以得到更好的資訊來幫助估測，如此，
可以得到良好的遞迴方式。我們所執行計畫
之主要內容為遞迴式的通道訊號偵測，即為
利用解碼器的額外資訊來增加通道等化以及
通道估測的效能，圖一為遞迴式的訊號偵測

VTC2008-Spring (如附件一)。此次的研究則著
重於遞迴式通道估測技術。
整個遞迴式的通道估測系統的基本運算
過程可以簡述如下：產生資料串 bv後，經通
道編碼(encoder)產生 cu，經交錯器(interleaver)
產生 uc，再經映射(mapper)後得到 Z，而在經
過反快速傅立葉轉換(IFFT)之前，會插入導引
（pilot）符號 P，導引符號的排放如圖二，
再經通道到接收端，因此在接收端所收到的
訊號表示如下：
, , , ,k l k l k l k lY H X N   (1)
其中 ,k lY 為接收端所收到的訊號， ,k lH 為通道
響應， ,k lX 為傳送端訊號， ,k lN 為白高斯雜訊。
在收到資料 ,k lY 之後，利用己知的導引符
號經由通道估測計算得到通道頻率響應
(channel frequency response)，再利用解多工
(DeMUX)把導引符號的通道頻率響應，從全
部的通道頻率響應中移除，此時，所完成的
通道頻率響應是通道估測的初次估測，因而
其效能可能並不會太好，然而利用我們所提
出的議題，可以將其效能提高，把得到的通
道頻率響應利用軟式解映射 (soft demap-

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel 
reduced-complexity Jacobian radial basis function 
(RBF)-assisted decision-feedback equalizer (DFE)-based turbo 
equalization (TEQ) scheme based on the modified Bayesian 
conditional probability density function. The proposed 
reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ is capable of 
providing a near-identical performance to the Jacobian RBF 
DFE TEQ at a lower computational load in the context of both 
binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and 4 quadrature amplitude 
modulation (QAM). When the channel impulse response (CIR) 
length is 3, in the subsequent iterations after the first iteration, 
the reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ achieves the 
addition/subtraction reduction factors of 1.69 and 3.39 and the 
multiplication/division reduction factors of 1.14 and 2.46 when 
compared to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for BPSK and 4 
QAM, respectively. When the CIR length is 4, the 
addition/subtraction reduction factors of 3.6 and 14.9 and the 
multiplication/division reduction factors of 2 and 9.14 are 
attained for BPSK and 4 QAM, respectively. These are achieved 
by utilizing the a priori data provided from the channel decoder 
to reduce the number of the desired channel output states and to 
simplify each distance evaluation between each desired channel 
output state and the observed channel output vector in the 
subsequent iterations. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
N order to obtain more reliable data transmission, turbo 
equalization (TEQ) first proposed by Douillard et al. [1] 
was utilized to efficiently combat intersymbol interference 
(ISI), and hence improves the performance of digital 
communication systems. TEQ [1]-[3] invokes an iterative 
exchange of extrinsic information between a soft-in/soft-out 
(SISO) equalizer and a SISO decoder. The computational 
complexity of the conventional maximum a posteriori 
probability (MAP)-based SISO equalizer is very high for 
large delay spreads and/or high order constellations [1,4]. 
This situation becomes rapidly intractable due to the need to 
perform equalization and decoding several times for each 
block of received signals. Symbol decision equalizers are 
simpler and computationally less complex than trellis-based 
equalizers. Hence, symbol decision equalizers are more 
commonly utilized to implement a component equalizer in 
the context of TEQ [5]-[7].  The linear filter-based symbol 
decision equalizer is often used as a component equalizer 
because has a very simple computational requirement [5], [6]. 
However, in fact, channel equalization is a nonlinear 
classification problem [8], hence the linear filter-based 
equalizer cannot attain the optimal solution for the symbol

decision equalizer structure, which is first derived using the 
Bayes decision theory [9], [10]. The radial basis function 
(RBF) network has an identical structure to the optimal 
Bayesian equalization solution [11], hence can be utilized to 
implement that.  Nonlinear equalizers using RBF networks 
have been successfully developed [8], [12]. Furthermore, 
RBF-based equalizers have been successfully applied to TEQ 
as well [7], [13]. However, the RBF equalizer suffers from 
high computational load for channels with long impulse 
response channels and/or large constellation sizes. For 
RBF-assisted TEQs, the high computational complexity of 
RBF-based equalizers is exacerbated by the need to operate in 
an iterative manner with a SISO decoder. Therefore, the 
development of reduced-complexity RBF-assisted TEQs is 
critical in practical RBF-assisted TEQ applications.

equalizer, and ( )DeL ⋅  denotes the extrinsic LLR yielded from 
the SISO decoder. Refer to [3] and references therein for a 
detailed description concerning the turbo equalization 
principle. 
Referring to (6), it is obvious that the modified Bayesian 
decision variable also has an equivalent structure to the RBF 
network. For this reason, the RBF network using Gaussian 
RBFs can still be used to implement the modified Bayesian 
equalization solution, whereas only requires using less hidden 
nodes compared to the conventional RBF equalizer 
implementing the optimal Bayesian equalization solution. 
This RBF-based equalizer having less hidden nodes is termed 
as the reduced-complexity RBF equalizer. Referring to (6), 
the decision variables for the reduced-complexity RBF 
equalizer implementing the modified Bayesian equalization 
solution can be formulated as

Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for the BER performance and the 
computational complexity in the context of BPSK and 4 
QAM. The proposed reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE 
TEQ was capable of achieving a near-identical performance 
to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for both BPSK and 4QAM 
systems, when communicating over the three-path, 
equal-weight, symbol-spaced burst-invariant Rayleigh fading 
channel, as demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3. When the CIR 
length is 1 3L + = , in the subsequent iterations the 
addition/subtraction reduction factors of 1.69 and 3.39 were 
obtained by the reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ 
compared to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for BPSK and 
4QAM, respectively. The multiplication/division reduction 
factor was 1.14 and 2.46 for BPSK and 4QAM, respectively. 
When the CIR length is increased as 1 4L + = , the 
addition/subtraction reduction factor was 3.6 and 14.9, and 
the multiplication/division reduction factor was 2 and 9.14 for 
BPSK and 4QAM, respectively. Therefore, our proposed 
reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ not only 
employed the a priori information provided from the channel 
decoder to improve the performance of the RBF-based DFE 
but also utilized the a priori data provided from the channel 
decoder to greatly reduce its computational complexity. 
Moreover, the achievable complexity reduction significantly 
increases when increasing the CIR length and/or the 
modulation order.

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel 
reduced-complexity Jacobian radial basis function 
(RBF)-assisted decision-feedback equalizer (DFE)-based turbo 
equalization (TEQ) scheme based on the modified Bayesian 
conditional probability density function. The proposed 
reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ is capable of 
providing a near-identical performance to the Jacobian RBF 
DFE TEQ at a lower computational load in the context of both 
binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and 4 quadrature amplitude 
modulation (QAM). When the channel impulse response (CIR) 
length is 3, in the subsequent iterations after the first iteration, 
the reduced-complexity Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ achieves the 
addition/subtraction reduction factors of 1.69 and 3.39 and the 
multiplication/division reduction factors of 1.14 and 2.46 when 
compared to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for BPSK and 4 
QAM, respectively. When the CIR length is 4, the 
addition/subtraction reduction factors of 3.6 and 14.9 and the 
multiplication/division reduction factors of 2 and 9.14 are 
attained for BPSK and 4 QAM, respectively. These are achieved 
by utilizing the a priori data provided from the channel decoder 
to reduce the number of the desired channel output states and to 
simplify each distance evaluation between each desired channel 
output state and the observed channel output vector in the 
subsequent iterations. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
N order to obtain more reliable data transmission, turbo 
equalization (TEQ) first proposed by Douillard et al. [1] 
was utilized to efficiently combat intersymbol interference 
(ISI), and hence improves the performance of digital 
communication systems. TEQ [1]-[3] invokes an iterative 
exchange of extrinsic information between a soft-in/soft-out 
(SISO) equalizer and a SISO decoder. The computational 
complexity of the conventional maximum a posteriori 
probability (MAP)-based SISO equalizer is very high for 
large delay spreads and/or high order constellations [1,4]. 
This situation becomes rapidly intractable due to the need to 
perform equalization and decoding several times for each 
block of received signals. Symbol decision equalizers are 
simpler and computationally less complex than trellis-based 
equalizers. Hence, symbol decision equalizers are more 
commonly utilized to implement a component equalizer in 
the context of TEQ [5]-[7].  The linear filter-based symbol 
decision equalizer is often used as a component equalizer 
because has a very simple computational requirement [5], [6]. 
However, in fact, channel equalization is a nonlinear 
classification problem [8], hence the linear filter-based 
equalizer cannot attain the optimal solution for the symbol

decision equalizer structure, which is first derived using the 
Bayes decision theory [9], [10]. The radial basis function 
(RBF) network has an identical structure to the optimal 
Bayesian equalization solution [11], hence can be utilized to 
implement that.  Nonlinear equalizers using RBF networks 
have been successfully developed [8], [12]. Furthermore, 
RBF-based equalizers have been successfully applied to TEQ 
as well [7], [13]. However, the RBF equalizer suffers from 
high computational load for channels with long impulse 
response channels and/or large constellation sizes. For 
RBF-assisted TEQs, the high computational complexity of 
RBF-based equalizers is exacerbated by the need to operate in 
an iterative manner with a SISO decoder. Therefore, the 
development of reduced-complexity RBF-assisted TEQs is 
critical in practical RBF-assisted TEQ applications.

equalizer, and ( )DeL ⋅  denotes the extrinsic LLR yielded from 
the SISO decoder. Refer to [3] and references therein for a 
detailed description concerning the turbo equalization 
principle. 
Referring to (6), it is obvious that the modified Bayesian 
decision variable also has an equivalent structure to the RBF 
network. For this reason, the RBF network using Gaussian 
RBFs can still be used to implement the modified Bayesian 
equalization solution, whereas only requires using less hidden 
nodes compared to the conventional RBF equalizer 
implementing the optimal Bayesian equalization solution. 
This RBF-based equalizer having less hidden nodes is termed 
as the reduced-complexity RBF equalizer. Referring to (6), 
the decision variables for the reduced-complexity RBF 
equalizer implementing the modified Bayesian equalization 
solution can be formulated as
