corrosion tests with a 100 ppm Na fuel equivalent. Miller and Berndt
[22] demonstrated that laser-glazing prevented surface spalling of
TBCs when TBCs were subjected to a high heat ﬂux. Thermal cyclic
studies [23–26] have indicated that laser-glazing signiﬁcantly
increases the cyclic life of certain plasma-sprayed TBCs. High tem-
perature corrosion studies [12,13] conﬁrmed that lifetimes of the
plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia TBCs were increased approx.
fourfold by laser-glazing in the V2O5 salt-containing tests. Previous
erosion investigation [27] also demonstrated that the erosion rate of
laser-glazed samples tested at 30°, 45° and 60° were about one third
that of plasma-sprayed samples. When samples were tested at 75°,
laser-glazing improved the erosion resistance about 1.5 times. Chwa's
study [28] highlighted similar erosion improvements.
Regarding materials investigated utilising laser-glazed TBCs; most
of them were related to yttria-stabilized zirconia. However, when
applied in a more demanding environment, such as higher tempera-
tures, corrosion and stress were scrutinised, the CeO2–Y2O3–ZrO2
coating appeared to be promising [29–32]. Results conclude from
these studies indicate that the CeO2–Y2O3–ZrO2 coating was superior
to the Y2O3–ZrO2 coating due to its phase stability at high
temperature, improved thermal insulation [30], higher coefﬁcient of
thermal expansion (CTE) [30,31] and good corrosion resistance [32].
Due to authors' previous studies all are related to the Y2O3–ZrO2
coatings and succeed in systematically elucidating the performance of
laser-glazed zirconia TBCs with various stabilizers. The purpose of this
study is to clarify the microstructures and thermal cyclic behavior
of laser-glazed plasma-sprayed CeO2–Y2O3–ZrO2 thermal barrier
coatings.
2. Experimental procedure
The substrates, 100 mm×25 mm×2 mm Hastelloy-X superalloy
coupons, were ultrasonically cleaned and then grit-blasted with
alumina powder to increase adherence capability between bond coat
and substrate. Both sides of the samples were ﬁrst sprayed with a Ni–
22Cr–10Al–1Y bond coat and then with a 25 wt.%CeO2–2.5wt.%Y2O3–
ZrO2 ceria–yttria-stabilized zirconia (CYSZ) top coat, using an air-
plasma spraying system (Plasma-Technik M1100C, Suzer Metco, gun
type: F4MB) under the similar spraying conditions as described
elsewhere [24] except Ar ﬂow rate and H2 ﬂow rate were respectively
40 and 10 l min−1 for spraying top coat. Bond coat and top coat
thicknesses were about 60 μm and 200 μm, respectively. A few as-
sprayed specimens were glazed by using a pulsed CO2 laser under
shielding with argon gas. The laser-glazing parameters were also
similar to those presented in a previous investigation [24,25].
After laser-glazing, both plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed speci-
mens were then subjected to thermal cyclic testing in an electric
furnace. The test durationwas 1 h at 1100±5 °C in normal air followed
by 10 min of forced-air cooling to an ambient temperature outside the
furnace. The masses of each specimen was measured every 2 cycles
(except the ﬁrst cycle) utilizing a precision electronic balance with
0.1 mg accuracy. Two types of cyclical life of the top coating were
deﬁned as follows: 1. when spallation was initiated, 2. when 50%
spallation was generated on one side of the specimen after the
specimens had been cooled to room temperature. Themicrostructures
of both as-processed and tested coatings were scrutinized by using
optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). An energy-dispersive spectro-
scopy (EDS) equipped to SEM was used to analyze the elements of the
thermally grown oxide (TGO). X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using Cu Kα
radiation operated at 45 kV and 40 mA was utilized to analyze the
phases of the top coat and that of the thermally grown oxide (TGO).
The following scans were performed for each specimen: 1. A
continuous scan of region 2θ=20°–100°, at 0.04° s−1; 2. A slow scan
at 0.01° s−1 of regions 2θ=27°–33° and 2θ=71°–75° to examine the
{111} type and the {400} type diffraction. Gaussian peak shapes were
used in the peak intensity calculation and peak ﬁtting for XRD
analysis. Deconvolution of overlapping peaks were performed under
graphic software (OriginPro 7.0) using a manually operated iterative
method. The mole ratios of the phases (monoclinic, tetragonal and
cubic) of the as-processed and tested top coats were calculated using
expressions from Miller et al. [33]. The mole ratio of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 to
tetragonal plus cubic phases was calculated according to the peak
ratio of (200) Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 to (200) tetragonal plus cubic.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructure
Typical optical microstructures of the plasma-sprayed and laser-
glazed coatings are respectively shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Thickness
and porosity of the top coat were about 200 μm and 13% respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the glazed layer had a dense remelted
microstructure and segmented cracks perpendicular to the surface.
The melted depth measured at the center of the glazed tracks was
approximately 36 μm.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) represent SEM surface morphologies of the
plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed coatings. In Fig. 2(a), the coatings
exhibited a very rough surface and a tortuous network of microcracks
and splats. Protrusions were also visible. Fig. 2(b) demonstrates the
glazed layer consisting of a completely resolidiﬁed, dense micro-
structure, including segmented cracks. The width of the segmented
block ranged from 300 μm to 500 μm. Visible lines of surface rippling
appeared perpendicular to the laser traveling direction and were
caused by the pulsing laser. The surface roughness of the sprayed and
glazed coatings were approximately 9 μm and 4 μm suggesting that
laser-glazing had signiﬁcantly improved the surface roughness of the
plasma-sprayed coatings. The cross-sectional SEM microstructures of
the plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed top coat are similar to those as
shown in previous studies [24,27] in which the glazed layer solidiﬁed
into a columnar structure perpendicular to the surface.

cracks, which caused the glazed layer to ineffectively retard the
oxidation of bond coat. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the weight gain of all
samples continued to increase until approx. 130 cycles and then initial
spallation began to occur on the plasma-sprayed samples. Between
150 and 260 cycles, the weight gain of glazed sample gradually began
to reduce due to the spallation of oxide scale from the sample edge but
not due to spallation of the ceramic top coat. The cyclic life evaluated
on the basis of both events, i.e. when spallation was initiated and
when 50% spallationwas generated on one side of samples is shown in
Fig. 4(b). For initial spallation life, the laser-glazed samples exhibited
an improvement of two lifetimes relative to the plasma-sprayed
samples. It is found that the increased lifetime advantage was over
140 h. With regard to 50% spallation life, the laser-glazed samples
exhibited about a half lifetime improvement relative to the plasma-
sprayed samples, which is an improvement of over 100 h. It should be
noted that for both plasma-sprayed and laser-glazed samples, cyclic
life of ceria–yttria-stabilized zirconia TBCs were much higher than
those of 7.3–19.5 wt.% yttria-stabilized zirconia TBCs as shown in
previous studies [23–25].
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the cycled samples are shown
in Fig. 5. Except tetragonal (T) phase and cubic (C) phase (Marked CYSZ
(T+C)), The Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase was found in all tested samples as
demonstrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b). X-ray diffraction patterns in (400)
region of these three coatings were similar to that of as-processed
samples in Fig. 3(b) and not showed here. Comparing Fig. 5(b) and the
inserted graph in Fig. 3(a), itwere found that themonoclinic phase in the
plasma-sprayed sample disappeared after cycling. It was directly caused
by the homogenization of the top coat during cycling. Phase analyses of
both tested sprayed and glazed top coats are also summarized in Table 1
which indicates that the mol.% of tetragonal (T) phase decreased and
that of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase increased after cycling for both sprayed and
glazed samples. An increase of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase means Ce
diffusion happened during cycling; consequently the formation of
stabilizer-rich phase is expected. The result is consistent with the phase
diagram of an early study [35] as the sample was heated to 1100 °C for a
longer period of time.
3.3. Failure analysis
Fig. 6(a) shows the cross-sectional opticalmicrograph of the plasma-
sprayed sample which was tested to its 50% spallation life of 226 cycles.
There are two indications that the cracks were initiated within the
ceramic top coat near the top coat–bond coat interface, possibly near the
bond coat valley location (marked C). 1. The clearances of cracks near
valley region were larger than those in other regions. 2. Top coat was
found attached to bond coat in the asperity region (marked AR). Fig. 6(b)
shows the cross-sectional SEM micrograph of the laser-glazed sample
tested for 300 cycles to its 50% spallation life. It could be argued that the
crack locationwas same as Fig. 6(a). From Fig. 6(a) and (b), it is clear that
the cracks propagated through the areas near the asperities (marked A)
of the bond coat. There was a thin residual top coat (marked RTC) layer
attached to the bond coat when the cracks almost linked. It could be
expected that after top coat spallation, the asperities are more likely to

Busso et al. [36] predicted effects of geometric parameters and peak
cycle temperatures on the stress maxima relevant to the different TBC
failure modes using ﬁnite element analysis. Results proved the most
highly stressed region is found in the top coat around the valley and that
the magnitudes of the out-of-plane stresses in this region increased
rapidlywithoxide thickness. Studies of Freborget al. [37] andEvans et al.
[38] showed similar results. Previous study [27] showed that the
microstructure of the plasma-sprayed top coat consisted of a splat
lamellar structure and crack defects. It is reasonable to assume that
cracks will be initiated within this region. It is believed that creep,
sintering and phase transformation of top coat, element diffusion and
oxidation of bond coatwill increase thermal expansionmismatch stress.
In particular the out-growth oxides in the asperity region, as shown in
Fig. 8, will reduce the accommodation ability of the top coat. Con-
sequently, cracks initiated in the valley region will propagate through
the asperity region and will link. Finally, there is a possibility that
buckling and spallation of top coat will occur. The failure scenario was
shown in Fig. 7(b), in which TGO islands (black) are observed on the
bottom of the spalled top coat (gray). It could be concluded in this study
thatboth thermal expansionmismatch stress andoxidation of bond coat
dominate the failure of the TBCs. Failure of the TBCswas initiatedmainly
within the top coat near the bond coat valley region and propagated
mainlywithin the top coat and out-growth oxide near the top coat/bond
coat interface. Segmented cracks produced by laser-glazing improved
the strain accommodation capability of the top coat is the major
enhancement mechanism for TBC life extension.
4. Conclusions
The microstructure investigation shows that the laser-glazed layer
had a dense resolidiﬁed columnar structure with segmented cracks
perpendicular to the surface. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
showed that the mol.% of M phase, T phase and C phase in plasma-
sprayed coatings were respectively 1.2, 82.9 and 15.9, while the mol.%
of T phase, C phase and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase in laser-glazed coating
were respectively 84.1, 11.4 and 4.5. The phase analysis of tested top
coat indicated that the mol.% of tetragonal (T) phase decreased and
that of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 phase increased after cycling for both sprayed
and glazed samples. It was also found that themonoclinic phase in the
plasma-sprayed sample disappeared after cycling.
Thermal cyclic test results showed that the performance of the
plasma-sprayed TBCs improved about twofold for initial spallation life
after laser-glazing. With regard to 50% spallation life, the laser-glazed
samples exhibited about a half lifetime improvement relative to the
plasma-sprayed samples. The main oxides grow on the bond coat and
attached to the spalled top coat were NiCr2O4, Cr2O3 and NiO. Failure
of the TBCs was mainly initiated within the top coat near the bond
coat valley region and propagated mainly within the top coat and out-
growth oxide near the top coat/bond coat interface. Segmented cracks
produced by laser-glazing improved the strain accommodation ability
of the top coat and this is the major enhancement mechanism for TBC
life extension.

二、 與會心得 
1. 本次國內參加人數為歷年之最，可見國內在薄膜技術方面之研究之蓬勃發展。 
2. 在硬質膜方面，主要發展仍以四元以上元素之耐高溫耐磨薄膜為主題，製程上以 Cr、Al
及 Si 為主要元素，這是為防止薄膜在高溫時氧化，例如: CrAlSiN、TiAlSiN 等薄膜，加
工壽命長，硬度也可達 40 Gpa 以上，所採用製程為 PVD 製程，這方面國內之研究有相當
不錯的水準。DLC 及 nanodiamond coatings 仍受重視，未來在工具、光電應用上仍深具
潛力。 
3. 關於 Coating for High Temperature 國內做得不多，尤其在噴射引擎葉片應用方面，另
外將來有可能在 SOFC 鍍膜之高溫應用上會佔有一席之地。鍍膜在節淨能源、光電領域之
應用比重日增，應給予重視。 
4. 個人覺得藉由參加國際研討會，了解世界各國學者專家的研究分析方法、研究成果，了
解國內外研究與學術單位目前的研究方向與研究方法，無形中會提升自己的研究能力與
視野，是相當值得的一件事。  
5. 超硬鍍膜的機械性質非常特殊，其量測模式及韌性的研究與模式的建立值得吾人投入心
力鑽研。
