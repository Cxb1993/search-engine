Effects of Principal Stress Rotations on Sand Behavior and Their 
Importance in Geotechnical Engineering 
  
Abstract 
Effects of principal stress rotations are important features of granular materials. 
Experimental data for dense sand obtained in Directional Shear Cell experiments show that 
the rotations of principal stresses mainly influence the volumetric behavior. With previous 
loading, principal stress rotations in subsequent loading cause greater contraction but also 
greater dilation in further shear deformation; in particular, principal stress rotations in 
subsequent unloading cause relatively greater contraction. Numerical simulations also show 
that loose sand contracts more under rotations of principal stresses in loading or unloading. 
Principal stress rotations cause greater contraction if soils tend to contract under shear, while 
they cause greater dilation if soils tend to dilate under shear. Loading or unloading with 
principal stress rotations are common stress states for underground soils in the situations such 
as non-proportional foundation loading, excavation, and tunneling. Except for the soil 
structure interaction, the effects of principal stress rotations are important phenomena in 
analyzing ground settlements in these geotechnical problems.

displacements. In this paper, we concentrate on the macroscopic phenomena resulted from 
principal stress rotations by analyzing the DSC data primarily gathered by Alawi [9] and 
Astaneh [10]. Both researchers conducted numerous experiments on medium dense sands. 
We extract parts of their experiments to convey useful ideas. In these experiments, an 
automated raining technique was employed for preparing consistently reproducible 
specimens, and the experiments were performed in such a way that the effect of deposition 
packing was eliminated by the position and orientation of the specimens with their deposit 
layers consistent with the plane of shear. Underground soils are often subjected to loading or 
unloading with significant principal stress rotations in practical geotechnical engineering such 
as construction, excavation, and tunneling. Substantially larger ground settlements may occur 
due to these stress states. 
2. Principal stress rotations after loading 
Astaneh [10] performed experiments on U. S. Silica F-75 quartz sand (Ottawa sand), a 
fine sub-rounded to rounded material. Specimens were prepared at a relative density of 72 % 
and were thus characterized as medium dense sand. The imposed stress paths are shown in 
Fig. 2. The specimens were subjected to three-dimensional isotropic stress levels of up to 
51.7 kPa at point A, followed by a deviatoric stress 2/)( 31 σσ −  increased in plane strain up 
to 27.6 kPa at point B under the same two-dimensional mean stress 2/)( 31 σσ +  of 51.7 kPa. 
After point B was reached, stress probing paths, which represent different fixed directions of 
principal stress increments were imposed and resulted in continuous rotations of principal 
stresses under the same mean stress of 51.7 kPa. All the paths end at approximately the same 
magnitude of deviatoric stress with largest rotations of principal stresses along path 90 and no 
rotation along path 0. 
Alawi [9] conducted experiments on Leighton Buzzard sand with a wide variety of 
different sets of stress paths, some of which were similar to those in Astaneh's experiments. 
The specimens had the same initial relative density of 72 % as in Astaneh's experiments. 
They were initially subjected to an isotropic stress state of 34.5 kPa at point A, followed by a 
deviatoric stress to point B or C under the same two-dimensional mean stress 2/)( 31 σσ +  
of 34.5 kPa (Figs. 5a and 6a). Afterwards, deviatoric stresses increased or decreased in 
various directions under the same two-dimensional mean stress. 
2.1 Principal stress rotations in subsequent loading 
Following paths in Fig. 2, evolving anisotropy develops along loading and different 
responses are obtained in subsequent principal stress rotations. The results show that larger 
rotations of principal stresses cause larger plastic and total deviatoric strain (Fig. 3). 
Furthermore, it is apparent that the dilation angle in plane strain condition is affected by the 
rotations of principal stresses. The flat volumetric response along path 90 may be due to 
failure of the specimen. Fig. 4 shows the trend that larger rotations of principal stresses cause

principal stress rotations in unloading. The deviatoric stresses decrease from 200 kPa and 
2000 kPa for the loose and dense sands respectively with different levels of principal stress 
rotations. In comparison of the same reduction of deviatoric stresses, larger rotations of 
principal stresses in unloading cause greater contraction (Fig. 8 b and c).  
4. Practical applications 
The importance that principal stress rotations influence the volumetric behavior of sands 
is illuminated through three cases in geotechnical engineering, which yield similar stress 
paths in ground as those in the experiments. The representative stress paths underground in 
these cases are obtained by the finite element code PLAXIS with the Mohr-Coulomb soil 
model.   
Fig. 9 is an example where principal stress rotations may cause additional settlement of 
a foundation due to lateral loading. Following the initial Ko condition, the underground soil 
elements initially experience increasing deviatoric stress mainly in the vertical direction, 
which may be caused by vertical loading on a foundation. Later on, the foundation is 
subjected to minor lateral loading, which results in significant rotations of principal stresses 
underground and thus additional contraction in soils.  
Excavation next to an existing building is often encountered in urban areas. One of the 
greatest concerns is the settlement of the building, which relates to not only the soil-structure 
interaction but also soil behavior under these particular stress paths. Fig. 10 illustrates the 
evolution of stress states in ground due to the construction of a building represented by the 
vertical distributed loading, followed by the braced excavation next to the building. The soil 
element at point A is subjected to increasing deviatoric stress nearly in vertical direction due 
to the loading of the building first. Then as the excavation proceeds, the principal stresses 
start to rotate significantly with increasing or decreasing deviatoric stress. Hashash and 
Whittle [12] analyzed a braced excavation in a deep layer of normally consolidated clay using 
the MIT-E3 soil model. They also showed that the underground stress states involve loading 
and unloading with significant principal stress rotations. Therefore, one may make a lower 
estimate of the contraction of soils if ignoring the rotations of principal stresses. Lower 
estimation of contractive volumetric strains in underground soils results in lower estimation 
of the settlement on the surface. 
Another situation that can yield similar stress paths underground is tunneling in the 
vicinity of an existing building (Fig. 11). The deviatoric stress at point A increases in vertical 
direction due to the loading of a building. Then the principal stresses start to rotate in loading 
and unloading during tunneling. During non-proportional foundation loading, excavation, and 
tunneling, the underground stress states with principal stress rotations can cause additional 
contraction in soils, which is of concern in regard to surface settlement.
