1. Introduction
Photonic crystals (PCs) are structures in which the materials are periodically organized to af-
fect the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves. With the photonic band gaps (PBGs), the
frequency ranges in which the EM waves are forbidden to propagate, resulting from the struc-
ture periodicity, PCs have inspired much interest and a lot of efforts have been devoted to their
possible applications [1,2]. Among varieties of PCs, two-dimensional (2D) PCs, characterized
by easy fabrication, have attracted special attention and have been widely employed in various
applications such as PC fibers, waveguides, and photonic cavities [3–6]. Most of these applica-
tions make great use of the property of PBGs to achieve an extremely high degree of control
over the propagation of EM waves. Consequently, accurate analyses of the band structures, and
thus the PBGs, are quite significant for the design of these devices.
In addition to the spatial configuration of materials, material property itself plays a prominent
role in the propagation of EM waves as well. The refractive index experienced by the EM wave
propagating in isotropic materials is independent of the electric polarization, whereas that in
anisotropic materials is strongly dependent on the electric polarization, which is further related
to the wave propagation direction [7]. Hence, by introducing anisotropic materials into PCs,
the band structures change and some interesting phenomena have been observed and studied
[8–10]. However, the intrinsic effect on the concept of constructing the band structures caused
by the introduction of anisotropic materials has not been discussed in any systematic way and
is our main concern in this paper.
There are various kinds of numerical methods employed to calculate the band structures of
2D PCs. The plane-wave expansion (PWE) method [3] and the finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) method [11] are two usual schemes. In addition, the finite element method (FEM)
[12] was utilized for this analysis likewise. Recently, the finite-difference frequency-domain
(FDFD) method [13] and the pseudospectral method (PSM) [14] have also been demonstrated
to provide alternative good approaches to obtain the band structures accurately. Most of these
researches have focused on the structures made of either isotropic materials or anisotropic ma-
terials with diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors. But for many realistic applications,
the principal coordinate system of the anisotropic materials may not always perfectly coincide
with the coordinate system of the PCs [15]. Consequently, the development of a more general
numerical model which takes non-diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors into consid-
eration becomes a highly valuable issue. Based on this kind of numerical model, it becomes
possible to fully understand how the anisotropy influences the band structures and correctly
take advantage of anisotropy on the utilization of PBGs.
In this paper, an FEM based eigenvalue algorithm for the analysis of band structures of 2D
PCs formed by anisotropic materials is accomplished. The formulation is generalized to be able
to deal with non-diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors in the cross-sectional plane of
the PC for the in-plane wave propagation. For better accuracy and efficiency, the curved geom-

where k0 = ω
√μ0ε0 is the wave vector in free space.
A similar procedure can be applied to the TM mode. For the TM mode comprising E z, Hx,
and Hy components, Maxwell’s curl equations can be simplified to
∂Ez
∂y = − jωμ0(μxxHx + μxyHy) (9)
−∂Ez∂x = − jωμ0(μyxHx + μyyHy) (10)
∂Hy
∂x −
∂Hx
∂y = jωε0εzzEz. (11)
From Eqs. (9) and (10) we can express Hx and Hy in terms of Ez. Substituting these expressions
into Eq. (11), again we achieve the governing equation for the TM mode as
∂

)
− ∂∂y
( μxy

)
= k20εzzEz. (12)
For clarity we can express Eqs. (8) and (12) together in a concise equation as

with non-diagonal permeability and permittivity tensors provided that the TE and TM modes
are decoupled.

Note that columns 2 and 4 as well as columns 3 and 5 of matrices [K] and [M] in Eq. (39) can
be combined through Eqs. (33) and (36), respectively. Furthermore, if we divide row 2 in Eq.

(34) and (35). Similarly, {ψ}II and {ψ}IV can cancel each other when row 3 in Eq. (39) is
divided by e− jkya and then added to row 5 with the help of Eqs. (37) and (38). By means of

Through this procedure, the information at sides I and II is conveniently associated with that at
sides III and IV, and the matrices and vectors in Eq. (29) are correctly modified to obtain the
desired eigenvalue matrix equation of Eq. (44). Please note that, as every vertex belongs to a
vertical and a horizontal side simultaneously, it is proper that the fields at the four vertices are
linked together by the use of Eqs. (33)–(38), as has been automatically included in the above
manipulation of Eq. (29). This idea is indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2(a).

of the TE mode. From the numerical results we will explain the concept of constructing the
band structures for anisotropic PCs clearly.
3.1. Square lattice
The first structure under consideration is the 2D PC with square lattice, as illustrated in Fig.
4(a), consisting of square-arranged parallel silicon rods with relative permittivity ε r = 11.56
and radius r = 0.2a in the background material of LCs. The unit cell of this structure is also
indicated by the square region in Fig. 4(a), and the corresponding first BZ of the reciprocal lat-
tice is depicted in Fig. 4(b). For isotropic PCs, a complete band structure can be conveniently
constructed by simply considering all the possible directions of the wave vector k restricted
in the irreducible BZ (IBZ) which is enclosed by points Γ, X, and M, as shown in Fig. 4(b).
The reliability and completeness of the band structure obtained from this IBZ for isotropic
PCs are fully based on the structure symmetry, including the rotation and reflection symmetry.
For anisotropic PCs, the situation becomes more complicated because the circumstance experi-
enced by the EM waves is highly direction-dependent. The anisotropy may break the structure
symmetry, which in isotropic cases can be totally determined by the spatial configuration of
materials. With this consideration, it is reasonable to inspect more band structures constructed
from different directions of k in the first BZ.
To illustrate this phenomenon specifically, we take the square-arranged 2D PC of φ c = 30◦
as an example. We compute the normalized frequencies for four distinct sub-zones in the first
BZ marked by Γ-X-M, Γ-X′-M, Γ-X′-M′, and Γ-X′′-M′, as indicated in Fig. 4(b), which are
absolutely identical to isotropic PCs. The results are depicted in Fig. 5, in which the six possible

to the rotation symmetry. Besides, the appearance of LCs rotating at φ c = 30◦ also prevents
the reflection symmetry from a reasonable explanation. To explain what causes the identity of
segments X-M and X′′-M′, we appeal to the basic principle of periodic structures. For periodic
structures, every lattice vector R and reciprocal lattice vector G must satisfy the requirement
G ·R = 2πN where N is an integer [3]. Thus if k is incremented by G, the phase between cells
is incremented by G ·R, which is equal to 2πN and does not really affect the mode. For every
pair of wave vectors, k1 and k2, of segments X-M and X′′-M′, the difference between them is
exactly a reciprocal lattice vector G, as depicted in Fig. 6(b), so it is no surprise that the band
structures of these two segments are the same. Next we examine segments X ′-M and X′-M′,
another identical pair as shown in Fig. 5(d). The identity of this pair can be reasonably accepted
by applying the two reasons just mentioned above simultaneously. This idea is illustrated in Fig.
6(c) which reveals that the difference between k1 and k2 is also exactly G. In Fig. 5(b) and (e),
no conditions mentioned above occur, and, consequently, the whole band structures from these
corresponding sub-zones are quite unlike.
When the LC molecules rotate to φc = 45◦, another interesting behavior of the band structure
can be observed. With LC molecules orienting to this special direction, the resultant structure,
determined by the arrangement of silicon rods and the orientation of LC molecules, has reflec-
tion symmetry about the c-axis of LCs. According to this observation, it is absolutely reasonable
to predict that the band structures from Γ-X-M and Γ-X ′-M′ are identical to those from Γ-X′-M

φc = 0◦, (b) φc = 30◦, and (c) φc = 45◦.
two numbers obtained from Γ-M-K ′ and Γ-M′-K′ are, respectively, 0.635 and 0.640, and 0.634
and 0.639. As a result, the correct band gap of this PC for φ c = 0◦ will exist when the normal-
ized frequency falls between 0.636 and 0.639. In Fig. 9(b) and (c), there are two parts, obtained
from Γ-M-K′ and Γ-M′-K′, that do not have band gaps, and hence there do not exist band gaps
at all directions for φc = 30◦ and φc = 45◦. With these examples, we can see that the anisotropy
indeed has a great effect on the behavior of band structures and should be taken into account
for constructing a complete band structure.
4. Conclusion
We have successfully developed an FEM based eigenvalue algorithm for analyzing the band
structures of 2D anisotropic PCs when the TE and TM modes are decoupled. To demonstrate
this algorithm, two 2D anisotropic PCs, the square- and triangle-arranged lattices composed
of parallel silicon rods and nematic LCs, are analyzed. The relationships among the distinct
sub-zones of the first BZs for these two structures are examined carefully. The concept of
constructing complete band structures for isotropic PCs considering only the IBZ should be
modified for anisotropic PCs by taking into accounts enough necessary sub-zones in the BZ to
ensure the correctness and completeness of band structures. In closing, we like to remark that
we have also developed a more general FDFD based eigenvalue algorithm that can treat the PCs
discussed here and the numerical results presented in this paper completely agree with those

Abstract — A finite-element imaginary-time beam propagation method is developed for the band
structure analysis of two-dimensional photonic crystals. The correctness of this scheme is verified by the
analysis of a square-arranged photonic crystal.
Introduction
The imaginary-distance beam propagation method (ID-BPM) is often used for the eigenmode analysis
in longitudinally invariant optical waveguides [1,2]. In the ID-BPM, the propagation direction is selected
along a spatial imaginary axis, and the specific eigenmode can be extracted from the initial input field
by choosing the appropriate propagation step size. Following this idea, we try to develop an imaginary-
time beam propagation method (IT-BPM) for the analysis of band structures of two-dimensional (2D)
photonic crystals (PCs). To obtain the eigen-frequency of every mode for the construction of the band
structure, the propagation direction is selected along a temporal imaginary axis. Then the appropriate
propagation time step size is determined in a similar way as in the determination of the propagation
step size in the ID-BPM for extracting the specific eigenmode from the initial input field. In this work,
we adopt the finite element method (FEM), which can treat problems with curved material boundaries
easily, to realize the IT-BPM, and analyze a square-arranged PC to show the correctness of this IT-BPM.
Formulation
For a 2D problem with geometry defined in the x-y plane, the following equation can be derived from
Maxwell’s equations:
∂
∂x
(
p
∂Φ
∂x
)
+
∂
∂y
(
p
∂Φ
∂y
)
− µ00q
∂2Φ
∂t2
= 0 (1)
with p = 1/r, q = µr for the TE mode (Φ = Hz) and p = 1/µr, q = r for the TM mode (Φ = Ez),
where µ0 and 0 are, respectively, the permeability and permittivity of free space, and µr and r are the
relative permeability and relative permittivity of the medium, respectively.
Assuming Φ(x, y, t) = φ(x, y, t)exp(jω0t) and ignoring the second derivative term, Eq. (1) becomes
∂
∂x
(
p
∂φ
∂x
)
+
∂
∂y
(
p
∂φ
∂y
)
− µ00q
(
j2ω0
∂φ
∂t
− ω20φ
)
= 0. (2)
Applying the finite element technique to the x-y plane and using the periodic boundary conditions
(PBCs) as required in the 2D PC, we can obtain the following matrix equation:
j2ω0µ00[M ]
d{φ}
dt
+ ([K]− ω20µ00[M ]){φ} = {0} (3)
with
[K] =
∑
e
∫ ∫ (
p
∂{N}
∂y
∂{N}T
∂y
+ p
∂{N}
∂x
∂{N}T
∂x
)
dxdy (4)
[M ] =
∑
e
∫ ∫
q{N}{N}Tdxdy (5)
where {φ} is the global electric or magnetic field vector, {N} is the shape function vector, {0} is a null
vector,
∑
e extends over all different elements, and T denotes transpose.
Utilizing the two-point recurrence scheme, Eq. (3) is written as
j2ω0µ00[M ]
{φ}i+1 − {φ}i
∆t
+ ([K]− ω20µ00[M ])(θ{φ}i+1 + (1− θ){φ}i) = {0} (6)

eigenvalue equation and thus avoid the difficulty in 
guessing an initial value for numerical iteration. 
Therefore, the ID-BPM is an efficient method in 
analyzing a waveguide that is difficult to predict the 
modal index that is the propagation constant divided 
by the free-space wavenumber, as in the present SP 
problem.

3. THE TRIANGULAR WEDGES 
We consider both the sharp and rounded air/silver 
wedges, as depicted in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively, 
where 2r in Fig. 1(b) is the diameter of the tip arc. 
According to the Drude model, the complex 
dielectric constant of silver is – 15.9149 – j0.7477 
at the wavelength, λ = 0.633 μm, and – 111.0137 – 
j10.5657 at  λ = 1.55 μm. Due to the geometrical 
symmetry, we can consider only half of the 
cross-section with the symmetry plane replaced with 
a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), as indicated in 
the computational domain shown in Fig. 1(c), where 
PML regions of thickness 1 μm are placed around the 
three sides. Fig. 2 shows the mesh division of the 
computational domain for the case of a sharp wedge 
with angle α = 50○, with X = 3 μm and Y = 6 μm in 
Fig. 1(c). The number of unknowns corresponding to 
the division shown is 24764. Fig. 3 shows the 
enlarged views of the mesh near the wedge tip when 
the numbers of unknowns are 8899, 9945, 24764, 
respectively. The triangle side length can be as small 
as 1 nm near the tip. To examine numerical 
convergence of the calculated SP modal index versus 
the number of unknowns, we use the α = 50○ case as 
an example and the obtained results are plotted in Fig. 
4 for r = 0, 5, and 10 nm, where the effective index 
means the real part of the modal index and the loss in 
dB/mm is derived from the imaginary part of the 
modal index. Good convergence behavior is seen for 
each line. 
With carefully checked numerical convergence, we 
obtain the effective-index and loss characteristics 
versus the wedge angle, α, for r = 0, 5, and 10 nm at 
λ = 0.633 μm and 1.55 μm, and are presented in Fig. 
5. The r = 10 nm results agree with those presented 
in [8]. It is seen that at smaller wedge angles, the 
modal index characteristics depend drastically upon 
the r value. As r decreases, the mode is more 
localized near the tip top as evidenced by the increase 
in the effective index, while the modal loss gets 
larger much rapidly.
