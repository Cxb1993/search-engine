Abstract - Most literatures of Inventory-Routing problems find the solutions by simulation, but few solve 
the real case problem of logistics companies. This research will apply some specific real logistics 
company’s operating data to study the Inventory-Routing problem. This study first develops a mathematical 
model for this Inventory-Routing problem, next applies Savings method, 2-opt heuristic method and 1-1 
-interchange method to obtain the initial feasible solution, finally implements insert_move Tabu search 
method and swap_move Tabu search method to find the optimal solution. The numerical examples are 
illustrated to acquire the optimal total inventory routing cost, the optimal delivery routes, the related 
economic order quantities, the optimal service levels, the reorder points for the retail stores delivered in 
these proposed routes. The results show this model can be successfully applied in Inventory-Routing 
problem in a very efficient way. Finally, the performance of this proposed hybrid heuristic approach is 
compared with Savings method, Heuristic approach, and the current routing planning implemented by this 
specific logistics company. Accordingly, the outcome of this study is very promising in many aspects and 
should be helpful to this logistics company for its future planning of the distribution system.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In these years, since the evolution of supply chain becomes more elaborate, the distribution system design 
problem considering the location of distribution facilities, the routing of the vehicles and inventory problem 
simultaneously becomes more significant. Nevertheless, in the real world, most logistics firms develop their 
distribution systems only dealing with these three problems independently and intuitively. Most of them 
first decide the location of distribution facilities intuitively, and then focus on the vehicle delivery routing 
problem without considering inventory policy simultaneously. It is noted that both transportation cost and 
inventory cost play very important roles to contribute the most part of total logistics cost and affect each 
other with a trade-off relationship (Ballou, 2004). Specially while delivering publishing merchandise, the 
affecting level of inventory related cost will be increased significantly due to returning more out-of-date 
goods. Furthermore, according to our observations, almost all logistics firms in Taiwan plan their vehicle 
delivery routes intuitively based on hunches and experiences. Therefore, this research tries to develop a 
mathematical model to help logistics firms to design their distribution systems by considering the vehicle 
routing problem and inventory problem at the same time.  
Several esearchers have given their studies on the vehicle routing problem (Brandao, 2004; Gendreau et 
al., 1994; Gendreau et al., 1996; Gupta, 2002; Osman, 1993; Toth and Vigo, 2003), the location routing 
problem (Perl, 1983; Srivastava, 1993; Tuzun and Burke 1999), the combined location routing and 
inventory problem (Liu and Lee 2003; Liu and Lin 2005), and the inventory routing problem (IRP) 
(Campell and Savelsbergh, 2004; Savelsbergh and Song, 2007; Savelsbergh and Song, 2008). Due to the 
complexity of these distribution system design problems, most studies focus on methodology development

4. Model Formulation 
This research restricts the problem scope to one distribution center and 418 retail stores. An 
inventory-routing mathematical model is developed to find the optimal delivery routes, and the optimal 
customer service levels, the economic ordering quantities, the reordering points for all retail store delivered 
in these proposed routes. This proposed mathematical model is described as follows:

Compute the difference value dif = t_cost (j1+j2) – t_cost (j1) for all candidates of next transit retail store. 
Select the next transit retail store j2 with the smallest difference value and judge if total demand by adding 
j2 to the route is less than or equal to the vehicle loading capacity. If it does, retail store j2 will be added to 
the route and marked. If it does not, give up j2 and select another retail store with the next smallest 
difference value to judge it again. Repeat the above procedure until finally find the next transit stop. 
Step 7: Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 to select the retail stores yet marked to be included in the route until the 
vehicle loading capacity for the route is full. 
Step 8: If there are still retail stores remaining unselected, go back to Step 3. If not, go to Step 9. 
Step 9: Improve the current optimal solution by applying 2-opt heuristic method within each route until the 
amount of the iteration reaches 2opt_cnt.  
Step 10: Improve the current optimal solution by implementing 1-1λ -interchange method between routes 
until the amount of the iteration reaches 2swap_cnt. 
Step 11: Record the current optimal solution including delivery routes and the objective function value to be 
the initial solution of Phase 2. 
Step 12: Stop. 
 
Phase 2: Improve the initial solution 
After obtaining the initial solution in Phase 1, we first implement insert_move Tabu search method to 
improve the initial solution until the amount of non-improving routing insert moves greater than the defined 
threshold value of non-improving routing insert moves. Next implement swap_move Tabu search method to 
improve the current best solution until the amount of non-improving routing swap moves greater than the 
defined threshold value of non-improving routing swap moves. Finally, we continue to improve the current 
best solution by repeating insert-move Tabu search method and swap-move Tabu search method until 
non-improving iteration greater than the defined threshold value of iteration. The detailed procedure of 
phase 2 is as follows: 
Step 1: Set up Ite to be the amount of iteration for Tabu search, Max_Ite to be the defined threshold of 
iteration of non-improving Tabu move, In_Ite to be the defined threshold of iteration of 
non-improving routing_insert_move, Swap_Ite to be the defined threshold of iteration of

IV. COMPUTATION RESULTS AND COMPARISONS 
In this study case, the logistics firm has only one distribution center, which delivers various publishing 
products to more than 4000 retail stores once a day. Due to the complexity of real operation implemented by 
this distribution center, the problem will be too complicated to study if the complete procedure of real 
operation is directly applied to illustrate this proposed hybrid heuristic approach. Of course, we also prefer 
not to lose the reality of this illustrated case by making too many assumptions for various operational 
parameters to reduce complexity of the original problem. Therefore, this study begins with selecting part of 
delivery area of this illustrated publishing distribution center to collect the related operation information 
from the management staff. Next, we further select the delivered retail stores of 10 routes located at high 
density population part of the above selected delivery area plus the distribution center to be our research 
targeted points. These targeted points include one distribution center and 418 retail stores which related 
operating data located within the period from January of 2007 to March of 2007. The location of the 
distribution center and 418 retail stores are exactly given from the collected data, and the real road distances 
between these points are acquired from UrMap, which is an internet GPS system developed by a local 
Taiwan company and National Space Organization of Taiwan. The related images applied in UrMap are 
provided by FORMOSAT series satellites No. 2 developed by National Space Organization. This study also 
collects most operating data of this distribution center and other 418 retail stores from some management 
and operating staffs in this logistics company. These operating data are analyzed and modified into the 
 8
(1) The total cost for implementing the current routing planning of this real distribution center is 172125 NT 
dollars which is the highest one. The total cost for running Savings method is 138143 NT dollars, which 
is the second highest one. Furthermore, the total cost for implementing Heuristic approach is 138072 NT 
dollars, which is ranked as the third place. Finally, the lowest total cost comes from the proposed hybrid 
heuristic approach is 138038 NT dollars. 
(2) Compared with the total cost obtained from implementing the current routing planning, the improvement 
of Savings method can be reached 19.74%, Heuristic approach can be 19.78%, and this proposed 
approach can be 19.8%. 
(3) Compared with the total routing distance obtained from implementing the current routing planning, the 
improvement of Savings method can be reached 12%, Heuristic approach can be 13.3%, and this 
proposed approach can be 14%. 
(4) The amount of routes is reduced to 8 by implementing Savings method, Heuristic approach, and the     
proposed hybrid heuristic approach as compared with 10 of the current routing planning. It is probably 
the main reason that the total routing distance and the total cost can be decreased significantly from 
implementing Savings method, Heuristic approach, and the proposed hybrid heuristic approach. 
 
2. The Computation Results for IRP Model 
    In this part, the total inventory routing costs for implementing the current routing planning, the Savings 
method, Heuristic method and this proposed hybrid heuristic approach are showed in the following table 3:

Total cost saving  0%    1.183%   1.189%   1.652% 
 
According to the above table, we have the following important observations. 
(1) The total inventory routing cost for implementing the current routing planning of this real distribution 
center is 2620346 NT dollars which is the highest one. The total inventory routing cost for running 
Savings method is 2589354 NT dollars, which is the second highest one. Furthermore, the total 
inventory routing cost for implementing Heuristic approach is 2589181 NT dollars, which is ranked as 
the third place. Finally, the lowest total inventory routing cost comes from the proposed hybrid heuristic 
approach is 2577062 NT dollars. 
(2) Compared with the total inventory routing cost obtained from implementing the current routing planning, 
the cost saving of Savings method can be reached 1.183%, Heuristic approach can be 1.189%, and this 
proposed approach can be 1.652%. It is obvious that the percentage of cost saving obtained from IRP 
model is not as significant as the above VRP model. The reason is probably that the inventory related 
costs are almost in the same level for all retail stores and these costs are much larger than the routing 
costs connecting any two retail stores, will offset the original big percentage of cost saving obtained 
from the optimal routing planning.  
(3)  The amount of routes is reduced to 8 by implementing Savings method, Heuristic approach, and the     
proposed hybrid heuristic approach as compared with 10 of the current routing planning.

3. The numerical examples, based on an specific real logistics firm’s operating data, are illustrated to 
acquire the optimal delivery routes, and related economic order quantities, optimal service levels and 
reorder points for all customers located in these proposed routes in the IRP model. Of course, the related 
total inventory-routing cost can also be obtained based on this proposed optimal distribution system 
design. The results show that this proposed IRP model can be successfully applied in Inventory-Routing 
problem in a very efficient way. The outcomes are very promising in many aspects and should be 
helpful to this logistics firm for their future decision-making of distribution system designing. 
4. The performances of this proposed model are compared with Savings method, Heuristic approach, and 
current routing planning implemented by this specific logistics company.  
(1) In the IRP model, the total inventory routing cost for implementing the current routing planning of 
this real distribution center is 2620346 NT dollars which is the highest one. The total inventory 
routing cost for running Savings method is 2589354 NT dollars (1.183% cost saving), which is the 
second highest one. Furthermore, the total inventory routing cost for implementing Heuristic 
approach is 2589181 NT dollars (1.189% cost saving), which is ranked as the third place. Finally, 
the lowest total inventory routing cost comes from the proposed hybrid heuristic approach is 
2577062 NT dollars (1.183% cost saving). 
(2) To ignore the effect of inventory policy, in the VRP model we compare the total routing distance 
for implementing the current routing planning, Savings method, Heuristic approach, and the 
proposed approach of this model. Compared to the total routing distance from the current routing 
planning, the improvement of Savings method can be reached 12%, Heuristic approach can be 
13.3%, and this proposed approach can be 14%. 
(3) In both VRP and IRP models, the amount of routes is reduced to 8 by implementing Savings 
method, Heuristic approach, and the proposed hybrid heuristic approach as compared with 10 
routes of the current routing planning implemented by this real logistics firm..

1. 本研究針對國內某物流業者的現況，提出存貨途程問題的數學模式，並以節省法配合啟
發式解法求出起始解，再以禁忌搜尋演算法改善起始解，求出顧客點的最佳服務水準、
經濟訂購量、再訂購點、最適路線的規劃與存貨路徑總成本。 
2. 在選擇演算方法方面，本文先以數學求解軟體 LINGO 7.0 版的求出確實解，再以節省
法、啟發式解法與禁忌搜尋法所求出的解來做比較。在演算法求解的誤差百分比上，節
省法解的品質比較不穩定，平均誤差為 17.06%，最小誤差為 0.0001%，最大誤差達到
52.81%；而啟發式法的解，平均誤差已降至 8.79%，最小誤差為 0%，然而最大仍有 36.34%
的誤差，有時解的品質會與最佳解相差甚遠；而禁忌搜尋演算法的平均誤差只有 0.42%，
最小誤差為 0%，最大誤差為 3.16%。相較於節省法與啟發式解法，禁忌搜尋演算法雖然
無法求得最佳解，卻可以趨近最佳解，且誤差甚小。在禁忌搜尋法與 LINGO 軟體的比
較測試中，因此，本文採取禁忌搜尋法來做為求取模型解的工具算是不錯的選擇。

    In the above mathematical model formulation, the objective 
function is to minimize average stock inventory carrying cost, 
ordering cost, shortage cost, safety stock inventory carrying 
cost, transportation cost and apportion charge of fixed vehicle 
purchase cost. Constraint (1) expresses the amount of each 
delivery to retail stores must be less than or equal to vehicle 
loading capacity. Constraint (2) states each customer appears 
in only one route. Constraint (3) assures each route begins and 
ends at the same depot. Constraint (4) insures that each point 
entered by the vehicle should be the same point the vehicle 
leaves. Constraint (5) states a route can only be served by one 
depot. Constraint (6) expresses a retail store can be allocated to 
a depot only if there is a route passing by that retail store. 
Constraints (7) to (9) assure the integrality of decision 
variables. 
 
III. THE PROPOSED HYBRID HEURISTIC APPROACH 
This paper combines Savings method, 2-opt heuristic 
method, 1-1 λ - interchange method and two Tabu search 
methods to solve this proposed inventory-routing problem. 
First, in phase 1 Savings method, 2-opt heuristic method and 1-
1 λ -interchange method are applied to obtain the initial 
feasible solution. Furthermore, in phase 2 insert_move Tabu 
search method and swap_move Tabu search method are 
implemented to find the optimal solution. Figure 1 shows the 
randomly select a retail store j1 in V i . Furthermore 
find two retail stores, j2 and j3  in V j which are 
nearest to j1 . Insert j1 into the position between 
j2 and j3 . Eliminate j1 from V j . 
Step 3: Are the total order quantities of all retail stores 
delivered in V i and V j during each delivery run less 
than or equal to vehicle loading capacity. If yes, go to 
Step 4. Otherwise, go to Step 2. 
Step 4: Select the insert move with the lowest objective 
function value during the candidate list. 
Step 5: Is the candidate move in the Tabu list (The length of 
Tabu list is assumed 7 in this study by referring to 
Glover [5]. If yes, go to Step 6. If not, go to Step 7 
Step 6: If this candidate move follows Aspiration criterion (i.e. 
t_cost ( X 1 ) ≤ t_cost( X* ) ), go to Step 7. Otherwise, 
go to Step 4, and select the move with the second  
lowest objective function value during the candidate 
list.  
Step 7: Implement this insert move. Update X 0 = X 1 , 
t_cost( X 0 ) = t_cost ( X 1 ), and renew the Tabu list. 
Step 8: If t_cost ( X 1 ) < t_cost( X* ), X* = X 1 , t_cost( X* ) = 
t_cost ( X 1 ) 
Step 9: If Ite ≥  In_Ite, go to Step 10, Otherwise, go back to 
Step 2. 
Step 10: Generate candidate moves (from X 0 to X 1 ) using the 
swap move randomly. The swap move begins with 
randomly selecting two routes, V i and V j . Next 
randomly select a retail store j1 inV i and a retail stores, 
j2  in V j which are nearest to j1 . Exchange  
j1 and j2 . 
Step 11: Are the total order quantities of all retail stores 
delivered in V i and V j during each delivery run less 
than or equal to vehicle loading capacity. If yes, go to 
Step 12. Otherwise, go to Step 10. 
Step 12: Select the swap move with the lowest objective 
function value during the candidate list. 
Step 13: Is the candidate move in the Tabu list? If yes, go to 
Step 14. If not, go to Step 15. 
Step 14: If this candidate move follows Aspiration criterion (i.e. 
t_cost ( X 1 ) ≤ t_cost( X* ) ), go to Step 15. 
Otherwise, go to Step 12, and select the move with 
the second lowest objective function value during the 
candidate list.  
Step 15: Implement this swap move. Update X 0 = X 1 , 
t_cost( X 0 ) = t_cost ( X 1 ), and renew the Tabu list. 
Step 16: If t_cost ( X 1 ) < t_cost( X* ), X* = X 1 , t_cost( X* ) = 
t_cost ( X 1 ) 
Step 17: If Ite ≥  Swap_Ite, go to Step 18, Otherwise, go back 
to Step 10 
Step 18: Stop criterion. If Ite ≥  Max_Ite, record the optimal 
solution X* , the lowest objective cost function value 
t_cost( X* ), and stop this proposed heuristic approach. 
Otherwise, go back to Step 2. 
 
2. The Performance Evaluation of the Proposed Hybrid 
Heuristic Approach 
      In this subsection we apply LINGO software, which can 
obtain the exact solution for small size VRP problem, to prove 
that the proposed hybrid heuristic approach can closely 
approximate to the exact optimal solution. Due to the limitation 
of LINGO software, this study randomly chooses 20 groups of 
10 retail stores to be the test samples of VRP problem. The 
solutions acquired from Savings method, Heuristic method, the 
proposed hybrid heuristic approach are compared with the 
exact optimal solution obtained from LINGO software. The 
performance criteria include average relative percentage 
deviation (ARPD), minimum relative percentage deviation 
(MINRPD) and maximum relative percentage deviation 
(MAXRPD). It is showed that the solution obtained from the 
proposed hybrid heuristic approach (APRD=0.42%, 
MINRPD=0%, MAXRPD=3.16%) is much more close to the 
exact optimal solution than Savings method (APRD=17.06%, 
MINRPD=0.0001%, MAXRPD=52.81%) and Heuristic 
method (APRD=8.79%, MINRPD=0%, MAXRPD=36.34%).  
 
IV. COMPUTATION RESULTS AND COMPARISONS 
In this study case, the logistics firm has only one distribution 
center, which delivers various publishing products to more 
than 4000 retail stores once a day. Due to the complexity of 
real operation implemented by this distribution center, the 
problem will be too complicated to study if the complete 
procedure of real operation is directly applied to illustrate this 
proposed hybrid heuristic approach. Of course, we also prefer 
not to lose the reality of this illustrated case by making too 
many assumptions for various operational parameters to reduce 
complexity of the original problem. Therefore, this study 
begins with selecting part of delivery area of this illustrated 
publishing distribution center to collect the related operation 
information from the management staff. Next, we further select 
the delivered retail stores of 10 routes located at high density 
population part of the above selected delivery area plus the 
distribution center to be our research targeted points. These 
targeted points include one distribution center and 418 retail 
stores which related operating data located within the period 
from January of 2007 to March of 2007. The location of the 
distribution center and 418 retail stores are exactly given from 
the collected data, and the real road distances between these 
points are acquired from UrMap, which is an internet GPS 
system developed by a local Taiwan company and National 
Space Organization of Taiwan. The related images applied in 
UrMap are provided by FORMOSAT series satellites No. 2 
developed by National Space Organization. This study also 
collects most operating data of this distribution center and 
other 418 retail stores from some management and operating 
staffs in this logistics company. These operating data are
