1 INTRODUCTION
Optimal design problems which consider uncertainties as random variables or
parameters are formulated as problems with probabilistic constraints. Eq.(1)
is a generalized single-objective probabilistic formulation with random design
variables X, random parameters P, deterministic design variables x and deter-
ministic parameters p. The objective f is a function of deterministic quantities,
namely the mean values of all random quantities in the formulation and K is
the constraint set.

Constraints with random variables are formulated so that the probability of
constraint violation is less than or equal to an acceptable failure limit Pf,j . De-
terministic constraints (i.e., constraints that are not functions of any random
quantities) are considered in the probabilistic form as a special case with the fail-
ure probabilities Pf,j being 0.5. Equality constraints are not explicitly included
in this formulation. This formulation is commonly referred to as reliability-based
design optimization (RBDO) formulation.

The calculation of probabilistic constraints in Eq.(1) represents the major-
ity of function evaluations during optimization. Mathematically probabilistic
constraints are solved by Eq.(2). However, the difficulty in solving multiple in-
tegration and lack of information about the joint probability density function
FXP make Eq.(2) impractical. Several methods have been proposed to improve
the efficiency and accuracy of calculating constraint probabilities [1]. Impor-
tantly, each of these methods has essentially focused on Gaussian distributed
variables. The advantages of Gaussian distributions in computing probabilities
are from their rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, no matter which
direction a linear constraint is with respect to the current design point (the
means), the shortest distance from the design point to the constraint can be
used to calculate the constraint probabilities.
Two of the most commonly used reliability analyses, the first order reliabil-
ity method (FORM) [2] and the second order reliability method (SORM) [3,4],
use the concept above to calculate probabilities of functions of Gaussian dis-
tributions. FORM/SORM first convert a normal distribution X ∼ N(µX , σ2X)
into a standard normal distribution Z ∼ N(0, 12) via
Z =
X − µX
σX
. (3)
After this conversion, FORM states that a constraint probability can be
approximated as Φ(−β) where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of a

is then applied to Eq.(6) around a point xei . After the linearization, the results
in Eq.(7) can be obtained.

φ{Φ−1[FXi(xei )]}/fXi(xei )
(7)
If the following assignments are made as the equivalent mean and equivalent
standard deviation of Xi, respectively,
µeX = x
e
i − Φ−1[FXi(xei )]φ{Φ−1[FXi(xei )]}/fXi(xei ) (8)
σeX = φ{Φ−1[FXi(xei )]}/fXi(xei )
the standard FORM and SORM techniques can then be extended to non-
Gaussian distributed random quantities. [7–9]. It is also shown that the lin-
earization point xei is also the MPP of the constraint [8].
The standard solution approach for non-Gaussian random quantities involves
finding MPPs and equivalent means and standard deviations iteratively. This
process may have convergence difficulties and is computationally intensive since
calculating the location of the MPP for a nonlinear function is by itself an
optimization process. The conversion of constraints from X-space to Z-space
via the nonlinear relationship of Eq.(6) is also computationally intensive.
Although other methods for solving Eq.(2) with non-Gaussian random quan-
tities exist in the literature, for example see [10, 11], these methods becomes
computationally too expensive when Eq.(2) is inside an optimization routine as
the framework shown in Eq.(1).
This report solves the problem of Eq.(1) with non-Gaussian distributed ran-
dom parameters in a computationally efficient manner. In Section 2, the concept
of reliability contour is developed to present the minimal distance a linear con-
straint can locate with respect to the current design point to maintain a given
level of reliability. In Section 3, the reliability contour is extended to discrete
random parameters. The overall solution approach to solve Eq.(1) using relia-
bility contours is described in Section 4, followed by two examples in Section 5
and concluding remarks in Section 6.
2 RELIABILITY CONTOUR
Before describing this alternative solution approach for non-normal distribu-
tions, let us define a reliability contour surface Ψ = 0. For standard normal
random variables Y, we define a reliability contour surface as a contour satis-
fying
Ψ(µY,y) = 0 ∀µY : {Pr[l(µY) > 0] = Pf} (9)
for any linear constraint l. FORM states that the shortest distance from the
origin to limit states l must be β = Φ−1(Pf). Hence a contour with radius

of violating the constraint in X-space is approximated as the probability of
violating gˆj which translates to gˆUj in U -space. Hence, using the reliability
contour method, we can obtain the same accuracy as FORM.
3 DISCRETE RANDOM PARAMETERS
In this section, we will extend the reliability contour approach to problems
with discrete random parameters. Let us first consider the example of g(X) =
X1 + X2. Let X1 have a standard Gaussian distribution and let X2 have the
following discrete distribution:
X2 =

1, 10%
2.5, 40%
3, 50%
(13)
The probability of constraint violation is calculated using total reliability theory
as:
Pr[g(X) > 0] = Pr[g(X) > 0|x2 = 1]× 10%
+ Pr[g(X) > 0|x2 = 2.5]× 40% (14)
+ Pr[g(X) > 0|x2 = 3]× 50%
To represent X2 in a continuous optimization algorithm, a scaled delta func-
tion θ is used to approximate the probability mass function (PMF). The PMF

the X-space. Then we will describe how to use this reliability contour surface
within an active set strategy.
In the optimization routine, the number of required computations is reduced
significantly because the reliability contour method is integrated with an active
set strategy, such that only constraints in the working set are considered. The
point that lies on the reliability contour with the minimal distance to a con-
straint is called an MPP estimate. The MPP estimate will be the actual MPP
for an active constraint, and will be an estimate of the actual MPP for an
inactive constraint. Although the MPP estimate and the actual MPP can be
significantly different for an inactive constraint, the constraint value at the MPP
estimate will always provide correct feasibility information (i.e., “yes” or “no”)
for the probabilistic constraint it considers.
The relationship between actual MPP values and MPP estimates is illus-
trated in Figure 8 with two constraints g1 and g2. Constraint g1 is active at the
current design point µX while g2 is inactive. Actual MPPs, denoted as xMPPj ,
are shown as triangles; MPP estimates, xˆMPPj are shown as circles. The ac-
tual MPPs are on the constraint boundary and the MPP estimates are on the
reliability contour. Since g1 is active, xMPP1 = xˆMPP1 .
The location of the MPP estimate on the reliability contour is found by
matching the normal vectors (Eq.(20a)) and values (Eq.(20b)) of the reliability
contour and constraint boundary.

To reduce the computational burden in solving Eq.(20a) and (20b), we propose

Step.6 For active constraints, the actual reliability contour surface is used to
locate the MPP estimates;
Step.7 Constraint feasibilities are determined via comparison to their values at
the MPP estimates.
Consider constraint gj . The first two steps require calculating ∇gj and
Ψ(µkX,x) = 0 at µ

X. In Step 3 ρ is calculated via Eq.(21) and the safe zone
reliability contour is formed as Eq.(22).
Ψˆρ(µkX,x) =
n∑
i=1
(xi − µXi)2 − ρ2 = 0 (22)
The MPP estimate xMPPj is calculated as Eq.(23) in Step 4.
xˆMPPj = µX + ρ
∇gj
‖∇gj‖ (23)
In Step 5 if gj(xˆMPPj ) < 0, gj is inactive. Otherwise it is active and the actual
xMPPj needs to be calculated in Step 6 via Eq.(20a-20b). If gj(xMPPj ) ≤ 0, the
current design point µkX is feasible to Eq.(1). Otherwise it is infeasible and the
feasibility results are sent back to the optimizer.
4.4 Analytical Example - active-set approach
Active set strategies handles problems with a relatively large number of con-
straints comparing to design variables. In other words, when problems have ‘too
many’ constraints, active set strategies can help identifying important ones in
each iteration without going through ‘all’ constraints, thus improving efficiency.
Let us consider the following problem with
min
µX
f = µ2X1 + µ

X2
s.t. Pr[gj > 0] ≤ Pf,j (24)
where g1 = −(X1 +X2 − 1)
g2 = −((X1 − P1)2 +X22 − 21)
g3 = −X1 + P2X2 − 6
g4 = −(X21 −X2)
g5 = −((X2 + 5)2 −X1)
P1 is a continuous random parameter which has a Weibull distribution with
shape parameter being 6.75 and scale parameter being 15. P2 is a discrete
random parameter with the following PMF:
P2 =


2.0, 60%
2.5, 20%
3.0, 5%
(25)

Figure 10: Conservative Safe Zone
Overall, the method is straightforward. One issue to consider is that calcu-
lating the maximum radius in Eq.(21) appears to be dependent on the algorithm
used. For a gradient-based algorithm, a good starting point must be selected
such that the problem can converge while satisfying the equality constraint. On
the other hand, non-gradient algorithms have difficulties satisfying the equality.
Here we suggest that a combination of both algorithms be used. A non-gradient
based algorithm is first applied and the optimum is selected as the starting point
for the gradient based algorithm. Although it is a process requiring significant
effort, Eq.(21) needs only to be executed once for the entire problem. This
modest amount of pre-processing opens the door to rapid calculation of design
optima for large scale problems with non-normal variables/parameters and joint
reliability.
In addition, to implement the proposed method for discrete random vari-
ables, the converted continuous distributions might have some impacts numer-
ically in practice. The selection of the standard deviation for each Gaussian
distribution in Eq.(15) will affect the approximation accuracy directly. Appro-
priate standard deviation values need to be determined by conducting sensitiv-
ity analysis. The highly asymmetric approximated distribution will increase the
computation complexity to find the reliability contour and safe zone.
The results of this case study depend highly on the assumptions made in the
model, but they should motivate future studies using more complex constitutive
models. In this case study, we assumed that highway traffic is modeled as the
constant flow shown in Fig.?? and both highway systems have identical traffic
