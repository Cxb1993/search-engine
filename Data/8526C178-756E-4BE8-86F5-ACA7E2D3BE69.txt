二、計畫緣由與目的 
     The boundary effect on electrophoresis has been 
studied extensively in the past few decades.  Because the 
presence of a nearby boundary is capable of influencing 
the neighboring concentration, electric, and flow fields of 
a particle, the associated forces acting on the particle are 
affected inevitably, so is its electrophoretic behavior.    
The boundary effect is important, for example, in capil-
lary electrophoresis where the linear size of the available 
space for electrophoresis is not very large compared with 
that of a particle.  Modern technology often involves 
operations conducted in a micron- or submicron-scaled 
space.   
     The boundary effect on electrophoresis has been 
studied by many researchers through considering various 
types of geometries such as a sphere in a spherical cav-
ity1-4 or normal to a plane,5-7 and a sphere,5,6,8-12, a cylin-
der,13-17 an ellipsoid,18 a toroid,19 or two spheres20 in a 
cylindrical pore.  Liu et al.14 considered the electropho-
resis of a cylindrical particle in a long cylindrical pore.  
Under the conditions of long cylinder translating concen-
trically in a long tube, low surface potential, and thick 
double layer, an analytical result was derived, and nu-
merical results were reported for an eccentrically posi-
tioned particle with a thin double layer.  Assuming a thin 
double layer, Li and Daghighi21 solved analytically the 
eccentric electrophoresis of a rectangular particle in a 
rectangular microchannel.  Yariv and Brenner8 investi-
gated the electrophoresis of a sphere eccentrically posi-
tioned in a cylindrical pore for the case of thin double 
layers.  The same problem was also analyzed numeri-
cally by Ye et al.10  Hsu and Kuo16 considered the elec-
trophoresis of a rigid, finite cylinder positioned eccentri-
cally along the axis of a long cylindrical pore for the case 
of arbitrary double layer thickness. 
     Recent advances in various sciences and technologies 
urge relevant studies to focus on soft or fuzzy particles,22-30 
where a particle consists of a rigid core and a porous mem-
brane or polymer layer.  Because the presence of a porous 
layer is capable of influencing both hydrodynamically and 
electrically the electrophoretic behavior of a soft parti-
cle,31-36 the associated analysis is more complicated than 
that of the corresponding rigid particle.  Assuming weak 
applied electric field and low surface potential, Ohshima 
conducted a series studies on the electrophoresis of a soft 
particle.37-42  Saville43 and Hill et al.44 analyzed the elec-
trophoresis of an isolated soft spherical particle in an infi-
nite electrolyte medium for the case where the effect of 
double-layer polarization (DLP) can be significant.  Lee et 
al.33 extended these analysis to take the effect of particle 
concentration into account.   
     To simplify the analysis, previous electrophoresis 
studies are mainly of one- or two-dimensional nature, 
which can be unsatisfactory in practice because relevant 
phenomena are often three-dimensional.  To examine the 
electrophoretic behavior of a particle under conditions 
closer to reality, we consider the electrophoresis of a soft 
cylindrical particle of finite length positioned eccentri-
cally in a cylindrical pore, a three-dimensional problem.  
The pore considered simulates, for instance, the tube in 
capillary electrophoresis,45-47 where its radius can be 
comparable to that of a particle.  The type of particle 
assumed mimics, for instance, biocolloids such as protein 
and DNA.  The influences of the size of the pore, the 
position of the particle, the thickness of electric double 
layer, and the physicochemical properties of the particle 
on its electrophoretic behavior are discussed in detail. 
 
三、理論 
     Let us consider the electrophoresis of a soft, finite 
cylindrical particle comprising a rigid core of radius a and 
length 2d and an ion-penetrable membrane layer of uni-
form thickness c positioned eccentrically along the axis of 
a narrow, non-conducting cylindrical pore of radius b.    
Let m be the distance between the axis of the particle and 
that of the pore and %100)]/([ ×−−= cabmP  be the 
percentage of eccentricity.  The Cartesian coordinates x, 
  
cause the double layer is enclosed by the membrane layer, 
the effective flow region inside the latter is large.  In this 
case, since the scaled electrical force *EF  is relatively 
small, *U  is dominated either by *D  if it decreases 
with increasing P, or by the scaled electroosmotic retar-
dation force *2,DF , if it increases with increasing P.  
On the other hand, if aκ  is small and/or (c/a) is suffi-
ciently small, then *U  becomes dominated by *EF .  
*U  is insensitive to the variation of P except that when 
(c/a) is sufficiently small, implying that if (c/a) is large, 
then the influence of the boundary on the mobility of the 
particle is unimportant.  If aκ  is small, then regardless 
of the level of P, *U  increases with increasing (b/a); 
however, if aκ  is sufficiently large, the reverse trend is 
observed.    However, if (b/a) is large, then *U  may 
have a local maximum as aκ  varies.  These behaviors 
are similar to those in the case of a membrane-coated 
sphere at the center of a spherical cavity34 and along the 
axis of a cylindrical pore,35 where the membrane layer is 
positively charged.  If (b/a) is small (boundary effect is 
significant), then the behavior of *U  is dominated by 
*
2,DF ; otherwise, it is dominated by 
*
EF .  If (b/a) 
takes a medium large value (2.5), the behavior of *U  is 
dominated by *2,DF  when aκ  is small (thick double 
layer), and by *EF  when it is large.  A larger aκ  also 
implies a greater gradient of the electrical potential on the 
surface of the rigid core of the particle, a higher surface 
charge density, and a greater electrical force.  Note that 
whereas *EF  is always positive, 
*
2,DF  can be nega-
tive or positive.  This is because the hydrodynamic stress 
tensor comprises both a pressure component and a vis-
cous component,49,52 that is, *2,DF  can be expressed 
as2,20

*
2,DF , and its magnitude depends upon the strength of 
the pressure field.  For the present case, *)(2, pDF  is 
always positive, but *)(2, vDF  can be positive or negative, 
depending on the level of (b/a).  If (b/a) is sufficiently 
large and aκ  is small, because the rate of strain across 
the particle surface is negative *2,DF  is dominated by a 
negative *)(2, vDF .  On the other hand, if (b/a) is suffi-
ciently small and/or aκ  is large, then the rate of strain 
across the particle surface becomes positive and increases 
with increasing aκ , so are *)(2, vDF  and *2,DF .   
     It is interesting to note that the qualitative behavior 
of *U  as aκ  varies depends upon the level of (c/a).  
If (c/a) is small, the influence of the membrane layer of a 
soft particle on its electrophoretic behavior is insignifi-
cant.  In this case, *U  is seen to increase with in-
creasing aκ , which is similar to the behavior of the *U  
for a rigid cylinder.14-17   
4.2 Positively Charged Membrane 
     The result reveals that the qualitative behavior of 
the relationship between *U  and (c/a) depends highly 
upon the levels of (b/a) and P.  If P is large (boundary 
effect is significant), then *U  decreases with increasing 
(c/a).  However, if P is small (boundary effect is insig-
nificant), then *U  has a local maximum as (c/a) varies. 
The dependence of the relationship between *U  and 
(c/a) on the levels of (b/a) and P has not been reported in 
the literature, and can be explained by the competition 
between the scaled net electrical driving force *2F  
(= *
2,
*
DE FF + ) and the hydrodynamic drag *D  as (c/a) 
varies.  For the present case, the effective volume of the 
membrane layer increases with increasing (c/a), so are the 
amount of fixed charge, the associated scaled net electri-
cal driving force *2F , and the hydrodynamic drag force.  
If the boundary effect is significant, then the rate of in-
crease in *D  as (c/a) increases is faster than that in 
*
2F , yielding a decrease in 
*U , and that trend is re-
versed if the boundary effect is insignificant.  It is inter-
esting to note that the qualitative behavior of *U  as (b/a) 
varies is different from that shown in before.   
     The variations of the scaled electrophoretic mobil-
ity, *U , and the associated scaled forces, *EF , 
*
2,DF , 
and *2F , under various conditions.  Similar to the case 
of an uncharged membrane, the qualitative behavior of 
*U  as aκ  varies depends upon the level of (c/a): if 
(c/a) is sufficiently small, *U  increases with increasing 
aκ , and if (c/a) is large, then *U  has a local maximum 
as aκ  varies   As (c/a) increases, if P is sufficiently 
large (ca. 90 %), then the rate of increase in *D  is al-
ways faster than that in *2F .  This also occurs to the 
case where P is small and aκ  is sufficiently large.  
However, if both P and aκ  are sufficiently small, then 
the rate of increase in *2F  is faster (slower) than that in 
*D  if (c/a) is small (large).  The behavior of *EF  as 
aκ  varies depends upon the level of (c/a): if (c/a) is 
large, *EF  decreases with increasing aκ , and if (c/a)
