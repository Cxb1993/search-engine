policy of cash discount to pay for his 
purchases quickly in today’s business 
transactions. The retailer can obtain the 
discount percentage when the payment is 
paid within cash discount period offered by 
the supplier. Otherwise, the retailer will pay 
full payment within the trade credit period. 
Therefore, it is important to investigate the 
effect of cash discount on the ordering 
policies. Moreover, in reality, the most 
products will deteriorate during storage. In 
this situation, the loss from deterioration 
should not be ignored. The problem of 
deteriorating inventory has received 
considerable attention in recent years.  
On the other hand, the classical inventory 
models consider the demand rate to be 
constant but independent of stock status. 
However, for certain types of inventory, 
particularly consumer goods, the 
consumption rate may be influenced by the 
stock levels, that is, the consumption rate 
may be go up or down with the on-hand 
stock level. As reported by literature, a large 
piles of goods displayed in a supermarket 
will lead the customers to buy more, and the 
sales at the retail level tend to be 
proportional to inventory displayed. These 
observations have attracted many researchers 
to investigate modeling aspects of this 
phenomenon.  
In this proposal, an inventory for 
deteriorating items with stock-dependent 
consumption rate and shortages under cash 
discount and trade credit is developed. The 
objective of this proposal is to derive optimal 
ordering policies so that the annual total 
relevant cost is minimized.

Introduction   
It makes economic sense for a retailer to 
delay the payment up to the last moment of 
the permissible period allowed by the 
supplier. The supplier would expect that the 
payment is paid from retailer as soon as 
possible to avoid the possibility of resulting 
in bad debts or default risk. So, the supplier 
not only offers the retailer a permissible 
delay in payments but also an additional 
policy of cash discount to pay for his 
purchases quickly in today’s business 
transactions. The retailer can obtain the 
discount percentage when the payment is 
paid within cash discount period offered by 
the supplier. Otherwise, the retailer will pay 
full payment within the trade credit period. 
Therefore, it is important to investigate the 
effect of cash discount on the ordering 
policies. Moreover, in reality, the most 
products will deteriorate during storage. In 
this situation, the loss from deterioration 
should not be ignored. Furthermore, the 
classical inventory models consider the 
demand rate to be constant but independent 
of stock status. However, for certain types of 
inventory, particularly consumer goods, the 
consumption rate may be influenced by the 
stock levels, that is, the consumption rate 
may be go up or down with the on-hand 
stock level. As reported by Levin et al. 
(1972), a large piles of goods displayed in a 
supermarket will lead the customers to buy 
more. Silver and Peterson (1985) also noted 
that sales at the retail level tend to be 
proportional to inventory displayed. When a 
price increase is anticipated, the retailer may

The demand rate D(t) is assumed to be 
dependent on the current stock level, and D(t)

c and A are the unit cost of the item and 
ordering cost per order, respectively. 
Replenishment is instantaneous. 
Shortages are not allowed. 
Lead time is negligible. 
A constant fraction θ of the in-hand 
inventory deteriorates per unit time. 
Inventory carrying charge excluding interest 
charges is i. 
During the time the account is not settled, 
generated sales revenues is deposited in an 
interest-bearing account with rate Ie. At the 
end of this period, the account is settled and 
the customer starts paying for the interest 
charges on the items in stocks with rate Ip 
(Ip≥ Ie). 
A reduction in the price of goods given to 
encourage early payment with cash discount 
rate r (0 < r < 1). 
M1 is the period of cash discount in years. 
M is the period of trade credit in years with 
M1 < M. 
T is the replenishment cycle time  
TRC(T) is the annual total relevant cost when 
T > 0 
T* is the optimal cycle time which minimizes 
TRC(T). 
3. Mathematical formulation 
The annual total relevant cost for the retailer 
can be expressed as: 
TRC(T) = purchasing cost + ordering cost + 
inventory carrying cost + interest payable - 
interest earned.  
Consequently, we show that the annual 
relevant cost is given by

We find TRC11(T) = TRC12(T) if T = M1. 
Hence, TRC1(T) is continuous and 
well-defined. Both TRC11(T) and TRC12(T) 
are defined on T > 0.
