Abstract 
The decision objective of the 
multi-echelon multi-period dynamic lot sizing 
(MDLS) problem is to determine an optimal 
production plan for minimizing the sum of 
setup costs and inventory holding costs during 
the manufacturing process in a large 
production-inventory system. A completed 
optimal total cost curve can be generated by 
connecting the individual optimal solution of 
minimal total cost from all production 
situations (which are classified by the setup 
frequencies of the feasible production plans). 
Searching the near-optimal solutions within the 
flat zone of the completed optimal total cost 
curve for the MDLS problem may provide 
decision maker flexible alternatives of optimal 
production plan under an acceptable variation 
in total cost. 
The various optimal and heuristic 
algorithms found in literatures were used to 
offer an optimal or near-optimal production

A Flexible Decision Region of Dynamic Lot Size
: A Phenomenon Resembling EOQ Zone

Abstract
The well-known Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) zone is beneficial for giving some
latitude in picking the lot sizes in a continuous time inventory problem, but it is not
suitable in a discrete time inventory problem, i.e. a material requirement planning
(MRP) system. Within this study, the numerical experiments are conducted for
exploring whether an adaptive decision zone (such as the EOQ zone) also exists in the
dynamic lot size (DLS) problem with a single- or multi-stage version. The
experimental results indicate that a region around the optimal solution comprises
several alternative solutions with a small penalty cost from the optimal solution. This
region is named as “DLS zone”, which is useful to enhance the flexibility in decision
making in a discrete time inventory problem and to respond the situation of quality
discount and capacity constraints.
Keywords: EOQ Zone, Dynamic Lot Size, DLS Zone, Alternative solutions
automobile, plastics, computers, components, and furniture. Their survey results
indicated that MRP was the most widely used system (56% of the companies reported
using a MRP system) for production planning and control.
Even though the EOQ model is a convenient decision tool and beneficial for
giving some latitude in picking the lot sizes, it is not suitable in a MRP system (a
discrete time inventory problem) because the EOQ model assumptions are subject to
continuous time scale, constant demand rate, and infinite planning horizon.
Conducting the MRP problems, from the perspective of discrete time scale,
dynamic demand, and finite planning horizon, Wagner and Whitin (1958) firstly
introduced a standard forward dynamic programming formulation namely a dynamic
lot sizing (DLS) model. Wagner and Whitin’s model could be adopted to find out the 
optimal production plan (PP) in a single-stage environment. Then, Zangwill (1969)
proposed a backward recursive algorithm to handle the DLS problem with a serial
production structure (each stage has at most one direct predecessor and one
immediate successor) for searching the optimal PP set (PPS). By means of the optimal
PP and PPS, production managers can determine how many quantities have to be
purchased or produced in which periods at each stage. However, to solve the DLS
problems is particularly formidable (Bahl et al. 1987). Developing the quantitative
approaches to find an optimal or suboptimal solution was always a main stream in the
past literatures.
Apart from computational improvement, in order to make the DLS problems fit
the real life circumstances more closely, several practical cases had been taken into
account, i.e. quantity discount (Chyr et al. 1999), capacity constraints (Karimi et al.
2003), and product returns and remanufacturing (Teunter et al. 2006), etc. Over the
past fifty years, the DLS research papers were published constantly; therefore, several
distinguished review papers were also given birth relatively (i.e. Bahl et al. 1987,
the inventory level of stage m at the end of period t, and δm,t = 1 if a ordering or
production policy is adopted in period t at stage m and δm,t = 0 otherwise. Moreover,
the bill-of-material (BOM) concept is taken into account here. Let cm,m+1 represent
that c unit of demands have to be produced at stage m in order to produce one unit of
demands at stage m+1, namely production ratio. A serial DLS problem can be
formulated as follows:

Since by assumption Im,0 = Im,T = 0, there are 2T-1 feasible PPs at each stage. Let
pm,x denotes the xth feasible PP at stage m. The DLS problem with a multi-stage
version can be represented as a combinatorial optimization problem, displayed in
figure 2. Each node in figure 2 denotes a feasible PP and various feasible PPSs are
formed by the feasible PPs at stage m connecting with the ones at stage m+1.
INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE
2.2 A constraint on the PPSs between adjacent stages
In a serial DLS problem, the inputs at stage m+1 are always supplied from the
outputs at stage m immediately (Zangwill 1969, Love 1972). It means that the
vertical axis respectively. Connecting each total cost of various order quantities is a
total cost curve of EOQ. However, the feasible solutions yielded from the DLS
models are a series of PPs or PPSs in terms of a single- or multi-stage version. In a
serial DLS problem, the total cost for each feasible PP at the first stage and the
optimal cumulative total cost for each feasible PP at the second stage to the last stage
are projected on a 2D space, where “setup frequency(the number of setup)” and “total 
cost” are placed on the horizontal and the vertical axis respectively. Connecting the
minimal value of the total costs for the feasible PPs with various setup frequencies
(hereafter optimal points for short) at the first stage can be viewed as an optimal total
cost curve of single-stage DLS. Connecting the minimal value of the optimal
cumulative total costs for the feasible PPs with various setup frequencies (hereafter
optimal points for short) at the second to the last stages respectively can be viewed as
a series of optimal cumulative total cost curves of multi-stage DLS. One may notice
that the“curve”helps decision makers to know the variation of the total cost near the
optimal solution, but it does not make substantial sense because the DLS problem is a
discrete time inventory problem.
The lowest point on the optimal (cumulative) total cost curve is an optimal
solution to the DLS problems. Hence, to ensure finding an optimal solution is a
precondition for exploring “whether an adaptive decision zone (such as the EOQ zone)
also exists in the DLS problems”. The past heuristic methods failed to satisfy such a
precondition. In addition, the conventional optimal methods specialized in computing
an optimal solution but failed to search the optimal points completely. For example,
Wagner and Whitin’s model (1958) presented a good recursive relationship between
g(t-1) and the next period st that is useful to attain the optimal solution efficiently
rather than finding out the optimal points completely. In order to search the optimal
points completely, an enumeration method is proposed in this paper.
with a single- and multi-stage versions, an enumeration method is proposed. However,
dealing with the DLS problem with a large number of stages always encounters the
heavy computational burden (Simpson and Erenguc 1996). For overcoming the
computational burden, the utilization of database storage is applied in the developed
enumeration method, which will be implemented on a database entirely. Besides,
during the solving processes, the multiple stages are partitioned into a series of
adjacent stages for conducting repeatedly namely {stage 1 & stage 2}, {stage (1, 2) &
stage 3}, …, {stage (1, 2,…, M-1) & stage M}. The details about the implementation
of the proposed enumeration method are as follows:
(1) At the first round to implement the enumeration method namely conducting
{stage 1 & stage 2}:
Step 1: Establish a database for storing the computational data.
1.1 Set four data sheets, Solving-processes, Setup-cost, Holding-cost, and Demands
data sheets, for storing the computational data. The database structure is expressed
with figure 3.
INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE
1.2 Set the length of planning horizons (T) and the number of stages (M).
1.3 Input the sm,t, hm,t, and dm,t into the Setup-cost, Holding-cost, and Demands data
sheets, respectively.
1.4 It must be noted that the computational results of the following steps are stored
into the Solving-processes data sheet.
Step 2: Generate the entire feasible PPs completely.
2.1 Let β, a number in decimal system, vary from 2T-1 to 2T-1. Each βcan be
converted into a binary number to represent the feasible PPs completely by the
coded computer program, displayed on figure 4. Notice that the feasible PPs are
represented as a zero-one version, where “1” denotes the production policy and
5.1 Recall the feasible PPs from the Field 2.
5.2 Perform the Decoding Procedure (see figure 6) for calculating the total cost of
each feasible PP.
5.2 The total cost of each feasible PP at stage m is stored into the Field 5.
Step 6: Search for the minimal value of the feasible PPs included in Rm,x(v,j).
6.1 Recall the data from the Field 4.
6.2 Sort c(pm-1,x) included in Rm,x(v,j) to find out the minimal value, c(Rm,x(v,j)).
6.3 The c(Rm,x(v,j)) are stored into the Field 6.
Step 7: Obtain the optimal PPSs.
7.1 Since the entire solving process is a forward calculation, the optimal production
plan sets are:
  

*
, 1,
1,, .
m x m x

where ops x
 

(9)
In equation (9), *opsm-1,x means the opsm-1,x with a minimal value among various
opsm-1,x included in Rm,x(v, j).
7.2 The opsm,x are stored into the Field 7.
Step 8: Calculate the total cost of the optimal PPSs.
8.1 The total cost of the optimal PPSs is the sum of the Field 5 and Field 6 namely
equation (10).
      , , , ,m x m x m xc ops c p c R v j  (10)
8.2 The c(opsm,x) are stored into the Field 8.
Step 9: Find out the optimal points and the minimal total cost of the DLS problem.
9.1 Recall the data from the Field 8.
9.2.1 At the first round, sort c(p1,x) and c(ops2,x) with various setup frequencies to get
motcf (optimal points), where m = 1, 2; f = 1, 2, …, T.
parameters given in this example are listed in table 1. The details about the
implementation of the proposed solution method on the Solving-Process data sheet
are illustrated with figure 7.
INSERT TABLE 1 and FIGURE 7 HERE
The c(p1,x), c(ops2,x), and c(ops3,x) are projected on a 2D space (figure 8a) and 3D
space (figure 8b), where x = 1, 2, …, 2048. As the optimal points at each stage (motcf,
where m =1, 2, 3 and f = 1, 2, …, 12) are connected, the optimal (cumulative) total 
cost curve can be depicted.
INSERT FIGURE 8 HERE
A region around the optimal solution is relative flat (see figure 8) and comprises
several alternative solutions with a small penalty cost from the optimal solution. This
phenomenon is named as “DLS zone”.In addition, the same optimal solution can be
solved by Chyr’s (1990) cost-path algorithm, but Chyr’s method specializes in
computing the optimal solution efficiently rather than obtaining the optimal points
completely.
4. An adaptive decision zone of DLS
In production and operations management,“changes of setup cost”were a popular
issue. For instance, Porteus (1986) discussed the influence of setup cost on EOQ
model; Zangwill (1987) addressed a parametric algorithm for cutting stationary setup
cost and from EOQ towards zero inventory (ZI); Chyr (1996) investigate the effects of
varying setup cost in the DLS problems; Chung and Chyr (1997) presented a
mathematical approach to demonstrate that Wagner and Whitin’smodel (1958) was
close to ZI as t t ts h d  , where t = 1, 2, …, T. In this study,Chung and Chyr’s (1997) 
result is adopted to be a parameter (θ) for examining the impact of changes of setup
cost on the optimal (cumulative) total cost curve of DLS.
In figure 9 to 12, the box plots are used to present the approximate optimal
(cumulative) total cost curves of DLS with various θ by connecting the medians of
motcf completely, where m = 1, 2, 3, 4; f = 1, 2, …, 12. From figure 9-12, the
following propositions can be inferred:
Proposition 1: Whatever the θ is, the optimal total cost curve of DLS is a shape of
“bathtub”, but the optimal cumulative total cost curve of DLS is the 
“L-type” scree plot.
Proposition 2: A region around the optimal solution is relative flat and this region is
named as “DLS zone” in which there are several alternative solutions
with a small penalty cost from the optimal solution.
Proposition 3: As the operation stage increases, the DLS zone will be steadier and
flatter relatively.
Proposition 4: As setup cost gets higher, the range of the DLS zone will be narrowed
down relatively and the optimal solution will move toward less setup
frequencies.
Most importantly, the DLS zone is useful for responding some real life cases, i.e.
quality discount and capacity constraints.
For a start, we interpret the influence of setup frequencies on picking the lot sizes
since the optimal (cumulative) total cost curve of DLS is constructed by connecting
the optimal points completely. That is, increasing the setup frequencies in a selected
PP will get relative smaller purchased or produced quantities at a time, whereas the
purchased or produced qualities will be a relative larger amount at a time when setup
frequencies are decreased in a selected PP. In sum, setup frequency can be viewed as a
key index for the size of purchased or produced qualities at a time.
Case 1: Quality discount
In practice, suppliers usually provide a discount level (larger purchased qualities
is useful to give some latitude in picking in the lot sizes in a continuous time
inventory problem, the curent study explores “whether an adaptive decision zone
exists in the DLS problem with a single- or multi-stage version”. The approximate
optimal (cumulative) total cost curves of DLS are showed at figure 13.
INSERT FIGURE 13 HERE
In the experiments, the changes of setup cost are taken into account and the major
findings of this study are that:
 Whatever theθis, the optimal total cost curve of DLS is a shape of“bathtub”,
but the optimal cumulative total cost curve of DLS is the“L-type”scree plot.
 A region around the optimal solution is relative flat and this region is named
as “DLS zone” in which there are several alternative solutions with a small
penalty cost from the optimal solution.
 As the operation stage increases, the DLS zone will be steadier and flatter
relatively.
 As setup cost gets higher, the range of the DLS zone will be narrowed down
relatively and the optimal solution will move toward less setup frequencies.
The findings of (1) and (2) are useful for encouraging scholars to develop the
mathematical method for defining the DLS zone and searching the alternative
solutions efficiently (such a research can refer to Solomon’s (1959) study); (3)
indicates that ZI policy is an potential alternative solution in later stages; and (4)
means that cutting setup cost will get more alternative solutions. In addition, the
multi-stage DLS problem is only taken a serial production structure into account in
this study. The other type of production structures will be the subject of further
advanced research.
