1. Introduction  
  Thin films of aluminum and its alloys thin films are currently applied as the primary gate line and date 
line in thin-film transistor because they have relatively low resistivity and self-passivated characteristics. 
Aluminum, however, suffers from major limitations such as electromigration and stress relaxation, and 
therefore inducing hillock and whisker formation [1-5]. As devices become smaller, these issues critically 
infuence performance and reliability. Several drawbacks limit the applications of aluminum thin films to 
be further used in the development of large-area and high resolution active matrix liquid crystal displays 
(AMLCDs) [6]. Low-resistivity gate metals are therefore required for large-area AMLCDs because of the 
suffering from RC delay as thin-film transistors are scale down to the deep submicron region. High 
conductivity and good resistance to electromigration make copper thin films promising interconnect 
material in microelectronics. The current trend in shrinking thin-film transistors and integrated circuits 
to improve the performance of chips requires substituting copper for aluminum as gate metal and 
interconnects. However, copper oxidizes very easily at a relatively low temperature and cannot form a 
passivated oxide layer to prevent further oxidation [7]. Cu-based metallization therefore depends on 
eliminating the high reactivity of copper. This study develops a passivation method in which dilute 
indium is added to improve the stability of copper in an oxidizing ambient, while retaining its low 
resistivity, and offering excellent adhesion to the glass substrate over a pure copper thin film. 
A number of approaches to passivating the exposed surface of Cu have been investigated to overcome 
the issues. Doping Al into Cu thin films greatly improves oxidation resistance, adhesion to SiO2, and 
thermal stability [8]. However, the resistivity of Al-doped Cu thin film is higher than that of pure Cu thin 
film, such as the resistivity of Cu (1 at.% Al) is about 4 μΩ-cm. The Self-passivation behavior of dilute, 
immiscible Cu-alloy thin films is found to improve the passivated properties by adding a small amount of 
Cr [9] and Mg [6-7, 10-11] alloy. These immiscible elements passivate the Cu-alloy thin films upon annealing,  
either in vacuum or oxygen ambient, by forming a protective oxide layer on the Cu surface. Approaches 
depositing a capping layer on the surface of Cu films have also been suggested to overcome these issues. 
crystalline structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα 
radiation. The interface reaction and possible inter-diffusion taking place of the films were detected by 
electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) to obtain 
composition depth profiles. The interface structure was characterized by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). The adhesion of the film on glass substrate was evaluated by performing a scotch 
tape test, as defined by the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). 
 
3. Result and Discussion 
  Indium was adopted to alloy the copper film because of its low solubility in copper and higher 
tendency to oxidize than that of copper. Cu-alloy films that contained 1.5-5 at. % indium were studied to 
investigate the effect of indium on the resistivity of such films. Figure 1 presents the change in the 
resistivities of the Cu(In) films as a function of the isothermal annealing temperature in oxygen at 20 
mTorr for 30 minutes. The change in the resistivity of the pure Cu film when annealed in vacuum is 
included for comparison. The changes in the resistivities of the films were shown depended on both the 
annealing temperature and the composition, as displayed in Fig. 1. The resistivity of the Cu(In) film 
decreased considerably as the indium content declined. It also fell as the annealing temperature increased 
from 200˚C to 600˚C, which relationship is also clearly revealed in Fig 1. The general features of the 
change in resistivity each indium content are similar. The resistivity approaches a stable value as the films 
are annealed at a temperature above 500˚C. Comparing the results with the change in resistivity for the 
pure Cu film annealed under vacuum shows the drop in the film resistivity is probably caused by grain 
growth, and the relief of the internal stress of the Cu(In) film annealed under 400˚C. Annealing the Cu(In) 
films between 400-500˚C caused sharp changes in resistivity, while the resistivity of the pure Cu film 
remains stable. This fact reveals that surface passivation of the Cu(In) film is associated with the decline 
in the solubility of indium in copper during annealing, which causes the out-diffusion of indium from 
Cu-alloy thin film at temperature of above 400˚C. Therefore, the resistivity of the Cu (1.7 at. % In) film 
elevated temperature, causing the Cu (111) d-spacing gradually to approaching to that of pure Cu (2.08 Å) 
(as shown in Fig. 3). More In2O3 was formed on the surface of the film and the indium content of the 
Cu(In) thin film declined as the annealing temperature increased. Therefore, the d-spacing decreased as 
the annealing temperature increased below 400˚C. However, the d-spacing increased slightly as the 
annealing temperature above 400˚C, perhaps because the solubility of indium in copper was increased 
with an elevated temperature. Figure 4 plots the Cu (111) d-spacing as a function of indium content of the 
Cu(In) thin film for before and after annealing at 600˚C for 30 minutes. The d-spacing of the as-deposited 
Cu(In) films markedly exceeded that of the film annealed at 600˚C for 30 minutes because Cu(In) films 
dissolved more indium atoms in their copper lattice. Besides, thin films that contained more indium 
exhibit larger difference between the d-spacings before and after annealing; the d-spacing fell 
substantially when the film was annealed at 600˚C for 30 minutes because more indium diffused outward 
toward surface of the film forming In2O3. The maximum difference between the d-spacing of the film 
before and after annealing was 0.0338 Å, for the Cu (5 at. % In) thin film.  
Figure 5. present the TEM diffraction pattern of the Cu(5 at. % In) thin film that was annealed at 400˚C 
for 15 minutes. The circular ring with spot diffraction patterns suggests the formation of nanocrystalline 
grains in the film annealed at 400˚C. The diffraction rings demonstrated that the diffraction planes 
belonged to the Cu and In2O3. TEM revealed no copper oxide, and this indicated that indium has stronger 
oxidation tendency than that of copper. TEM was also used to investigate the cross-sectional 
microstructure of the annealed Cu(5 at.% In)/SiO2 thin film. Figure 6. presents a uniform In2O3 layer (~50 
nm) on the surface of the film annealed at 500°C for 30 min can be clearly seen, suggesting that indium 
diffused outward to the surface and reacted with oxygen to form In2O3 when the film was annealed at an 
elevated temperature. The formation of In2O3 on the surface of Cu film was associated with 
self-passivation and protected the Cu film from further oxidation. This 50 nm-thick surface layer of 
indium oxide was a remarkably effective barrier to further oxidation. Figure 7 displays the 
microstructures of the Cu(5 at. % In) thin films that had been annealed at 200˚C and 300˚C for 15 minutes. 
the amount of indium added was increased to 2.2-3.5 at. %. 5-15% by area of the 5 at. % Cu(In) film 
was removed, indicating that the adhesion between the Cu thin film and glass substrate became worse. 
Accordingly, indium content in the Cu(In) film that optimized adhesion with the glass substrate was 
1.5-1.9 at. %. Table I summarizes the results of the adhesion test. Cu(1.7 at. % In) exhibited a superior 
conductivity, passivation and adhesion among the studied Cu(In)-alloy films and should be considering 
the needs for adopting in thin-film transistors.  
 
5. Conclusion 
  The electrical, adhesion, and self-passivation behaviors of co-sputtered Cu-In (1.5-5 at.%) thin films 
are investigated. Annealing Cu(1.5-5 at.% In)-alloy film above 400˚C in oxygen ambient lead to the 
formation of an In2O3/Cu structure, and therefore inducing a low resistivity of the Cu(In) thin film, 
suggesting that the presence of indium in Cu remarkably reduces the oxidation of the film. The dramatic 
decrease in the resistivity results from the out diffusion of indium caused by formation In2O3 on the 
surface of Cu-alloy film. Adding small amount of indium also improves the adhesion between Cu(In) and 
SiO2, and the formation of indium oxide on the surface of the film provides an effective passivated 
capability for Cu film. The Cu(1.7 at. % In) thin film exhibits a low resistivity of 2.92 μΩcm and 
excellent adhesion to glass substrate.
