中文摘要 
    含銅污泥經鐵氧磁體技術處理後可以
使金屬氫氧化物之羥基複合物再轉化生成
鐵氧磁體結構，在鐵氧磁體生成領域時，其
中氫氧化銅會先生成氧化銅而不會進入鐵
氧磁體結構。因此由酸浸漬實驗發現銅的溶
出率在 10 分鐘即達 60%左右，其溶出潛勢
遠大於其他金屬成份。 
    因此本研究利用焦磷酸鈉、磷酸三鈉及
矽酸鈉等藥劑分散氧化銅與鐵氧磁體顆
粒，其中以 10-3 M 焦磷酸鈉對鐵氧磁體顆粒
分散效果較佳。將上述懸浮液進行磁選實驗
發現著磁物與非著磁物之銅品位約介於
14-16%，並無明顯之濃縮富集效果，由 TEM
觀察結果顯示鐵氧磁體顆粒小於 100 nm，
造成顆粒間之凝聚力過大，因此形成明顯的
凝聚體，無法以單純的凝聚分散方法分離氧

Abstract 
   The copper-contaminated sludge treated 
with ferrite method could be transformed into 
hydro-complex compound. In the environment 
of ferrite formation, the copper hydroxide 
could be transformed into copper oxide, and it 
would not be incorporated into the lattice 
positions. It could be proved by that the 
copper dissolution of CuO-ferrite complex 
could be 60% in 10 minutes during the 
leaching testing. 
   Therefore, the agents of sodium 
pyrophosphate, sodium phosphate tribasic and 
sodium silicate were utilized to disperse the 
copper oxide and ferrite for resource recovery. 
In the testing results, the dispersion effect of 
10-3 sodium pyrophosphate was more obvious 
than other agents. The CuO-ferrite was 
dispersed in the solution of 10-3 sodium 
pyrophosphate and separated with magnetic 
machine. The copper grades of magnetic 
concentrate and non-magnetic tailing were 
also 14%-16% respectively, and the copper 
oxide was not concentrated in the testing. It 
might be caused the strong attraction force 
between the tiny particles less than 100 nm, 
and the copper oxide and ferrite could not be 
dispersed in the testing. In the future, the 
selective leaching process could be considered 
to utilized and promote the resource recovery.

    經鐵氧磁體技術所產生的鐵氧磁體具
有磁性，採取凝集分散及磁選方式將分散之
鐵氧磁體回收是一項值得嘗試的做法，而氧

行凝集分散之前須考慮到顆粒在溶液中的
分散特性，Zeta 電位可以用來說明顆粒表面
的安定特徵，通常 Zeta 電位的絕對值越高，
表示顆粒在水溶液中越安定。而顆粒表面之
Zeta 電位大小與表面荷電量大小有關，欲使
微細顆粒間的排斥力大於凝劑力，由水溶液

使顆粒表面電位增大，使顆粒互相排斥達成
分散的目的。 
四、研究方法 
首先以模擬重金屬溶液以濕式氧化合
成鐵氧磁體。藉由 XRD、TEM、SEM、浸
漬實驗、Zeta-電位之測定、沉降實驗以及磁
選實驗檢討合成鐵氧磁體之物化特性，相關
實驗設計與方法分述如下：  
4.1 實驗裝置及操作流程 
    1公升容量之六口瓶球型反應器，內置

FeSO4溶液與其他金屬成份之莫耳比分別為
2、3、4)置入加熱包內加熱，以300rpm 速
持續攪拌由空氣壓縮機打入 5 liter

當pH、ORP數值達穩定時再進行固液分離。 
4.2 產物晶相及性質分析 
4.2.1 X-光繞射分析 
    將反應產物晶烘乾細磨至全部通過200
目，使用X-光繞射(X-Ray Diffraction，
XRD，型號Rigaku D/MAX-2500V)以粉末壓
片法進行X-Ray繞射分析，以銅靶(Cu 
Kα=1.5418 Ǻ)做為X射線光源，電壓30 kV，
電流100 mA，掃描速度4°/min，掃描範圍
20°~100°，分析式樣之結晶相。 
4.2.2 SEM 
    將試樣置於基材上，蒸鍍上一層白金，
以利樣品導電，然後置於掃描式電子顯微鏡
(JEOL JSM-6500F)下，觀察其外觀形狀及元
素分布分析。 
4.2.3 TEM 
    將鐵氧磁體產物粉末分散於酒精中，再
以超音波震盪機震盪20分鍾，用清潔吸管吸
少許分散式樣，滴於白色臘盤之福馬林碳膜
銅網，待酒精蒸發後以穿透式電子顯微鏡觀
察顆粒晶形外觀。 
4.2.4 Zeta-電位測定 
    取0.01克的鐵氧磁體粉末加入1公升且
各別含有矽酸鈉、磷酸三鈉、焦磷酸鈉之去
離子水(10-3M NaCl做為背景溶液)，以超音
波震盪20分鍾，分散劑濃度分別為10-1M、
10-2M、10-3M。以乳頭吸管吸取少許溶液加
入石英槽後使用界面電位儀分析。 
4.2.5 沉降實驗 
    取溼基(約2克乾基)含銅鐵氧磁體分別
與各種分散劑溶液中混合，分散劑溶液體積
約為100cc，以攪拌與超音波震盪確保顆粒
呈分散狀態，分別調整溶液之pH值為4、6、
8、10、11，靜置30分鐘並觀察沉降高度與
時間之關係。 
4.3 浸漬實驗 
    取60克鐵氧磁體產物以液固比5的條件
加入0.6N硫酸溶液，攪拌轉速為200rpm，分
別在常溫(20~30℃)下，40℃、60℃、80℃進
行酸浸漬1小時，每10分鐘取上方懸浮液一
次，每次取樣為20cc，取樣後馬上離心，以
500rpm離心5分鐘，待離心完後取上方澄清
液10cc於定量瓶中，加入些許硝酸後再加入
去離子水定量至100cc，並妥善保存於塑膠
瓶中，溶液稀釋至當濃度以原子吸收光譜儀
(A.A.S)分析重金屬離子濃度，另外再將鐵氧
磁體粉末溶於王水，以AAS分析鐵氧磁體之
金屬含量，以便計算金屬溶出率。 
4.4 磁選實驗 
    根據 Zeta-電位之測試、沉降實驗，選
定分散效果最好條件進行磁選操作，其條件
為使用 10-3M 焦磷酸鈉，本實驗參數條件包
5.3 酸浸漬實驗 
    為了解各雙元系鐵氧磁體之化學安定
性與溶出潛勢，因此對於各種不同鐵系鐵氧
磁體進行酸浸漬分析，以便考察鐵氧磁體產
物被溶出之動力學關係。 
5.3.1 鉻鐵系鐵氧磁體之溶出率 
    鉻系鐵氧磁體之鉻溶出率隨時間與溫
度增加而增加，溶出率介於7%~41%，結果
如圖10所示。顯示鉻離子能夠進入鐵氧磁體
晶格中而達到安定的效果。 
5.3.2 鋅鐵系鐵氧磁體之溶出率 
    鋅的溶出百分比約20~25%，隨時間及
溫度增加也無明顯溶出之情形發生，結果如
圖11所示，推測大多數鋅皆已嵌入鐵氧磁體
晶格中形成ZnFe2O4，而部份未進入晶格之
鋅成分因化學安定性差異而被溶出。 
5.3.3 鎳鐵系鐵氧磁體之溶出率 
    鎳模擬污泥之鎳溶出率大約介在
20~25%，離子溶出情形與鋅情況相似，結
果如圖 12 所示。 
5.3.4 銅鐵系鐵氧磁體之溶出率 
    如圖 13 所示，使用 0.6N 稀硫酸即可以
使超過半數以上的銅溶出，因此可以推測銅
離子應該沒有完全崁入鐵氧磁體之結構
中，或是僅僅附著於鐵氧磁體表面，以氧化
銅的型態存在，導致在浸漬實驗中之銅溶出
趨勢遠大於鉻、鋅、鎳。 
5.4 TEM 之觀察 
    如圖14所示，以濕式鐵氧磁體法合成之
銅鐵系鐵氧磁體，其顆粒甚小，由此照片可
觀察出奈米粒子的嚴重聚集狀態。因此，接
下來的Zeta-電位之測定實驗係希望了解透
過分散劑達到鐵氧磁體顆粒分散，使鐵氧磁
體與氧化銅可以在分散情形下，利用磁力分
選分別回收氧化銅與鐵氧磁體。 
5.5 Zeta-potential 之測定 
    本實驗以三種分散劑(焦磷酸鈉、磷酸
三鈉、水玻璃)，濃度分別為 10-3M、10-2M、
10-1M 做為分散銅鐵系鐵氧磁體之分散劑，
實驗結果發現磷酸三鈉、水玻璃皆以 10-2M
效果最好，而焦磷酸鈉則以 10-3M 較果較
佳，顯示添加過多分散劑極有可能會壓縮到
雙電層而造成反效果。而分散效果優劣依序
為焦磷酸鈉 (10-3M)、磷酸三鈉(10-2M)、水
玻璃 (10-2M)。而磷酸三鈉及水玻璃之
Zeta-potential 數值最多也只能達-40Mv 左
右，而焦磷酸鈉 10-3M 卻可以到達將近
-80mV，結果如圖 15-17 所示。另外由沉降
實驗也可以佐證焦磷酸鈉對鐵氧磁體顆粒
之分散效果。 
5.6 沉降實驗 
    未加入任何分散劑之沉降圖如圖 18 所
示，在沉降 10 分鐘即快速下降，之後因進
行壓密沉降而使速度趨緩，與圖 19 比較發
現添加分散劑(焦磷酸鈉，10-3M)時，其分散
較果更為明顯，尤其以 pH8、10、11 最為顯
著，顆粒間均勻分布，靜置 60 分鐘後仍看
不 出 有 沉 降 情 形 發 生 ， 此 一 現 象 與
Zeta-potential 之測定實驗吻合。 
5.7 磁選實驗 
    由 Zeta-potential 之測定、沉降實驗結果
均顯示添加分散劑焦(磷酸鈉 10-3M)之分散
效果顯著，因此進行磁分選時也依其條件進
行，而實驗之控制變因分別為漿料 pH、漿
料濃度、餵料之傾斜角度、批次送料收集。 
5.7.1 漿料 pH 值 
    漿料 pH 分別控制 8、10、11 進行磁選
實驗，其餘控制條件分別為傾角 45°、固液
比 1:10、餵料速度 5ml/min。由表 3-1 發現，
著磁物約佔 20%，而非著磁物約 80%，而著
磁物與非著磁物之銅品位分析約 14%左
右，並無明顯濃縮富集效果。 
5.7.2 漿料固液比 
    漿料固液比分別控制在 1:10、1:20 進行
磁選實驗，其他控制條件分別為傾角 45°、
pH:10、餵料速度 5ml/min。由表 3-2 發現著
磁物與非著磁物之銅品位分析約 14~16%，
同樣沒有明顯濃縮富及效果。 
5.7.3 批次送料操作 
   由表 1 及表 2 結果發現著磁物比率僅佔
20%左右，與鐵氧磁體具有強磁性的特性不
相吻合，因此考慮到很可能是在固定磁場大
小條件下，當分離管之著磁物過多，在漿料
流經過時，造成吸引力下降而使著磁物流向
非著磁物端，因此接著採用分批操作方式倒
入，並分多次收集著磁與非著磁物，其結果

Abstract:  This paper focuses on the crystalline characteristic improvement of metal-contaminated sludge. The utilization 
of alkaline leaching process was to dissolve amphoteric aluminum content, and that promoted the growth of crystal to 
decrease the water content of the leached residue. For example, the synthetic sludge of binary system of zinc and copper 
was treated with alkaline leaching testing, the water content of residue was only 43.2% and the sludge amount decreased 
86.5%. If the process could be operated at a suitable pH continuously, the dissolution percentage of aluminum-contaminated 
sludge should be increased and the water content of residue would be improved. 
 
Keywords：metal-contaminated sludge，waste reduction, alkaline leaching process. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The vast variety of chemicals used in the manufacturing 
procedures of printed circuit board and galvanic industries, 
the wastewater treatment generally involves 
coagulation-flocculation followed by precipitation. Owing 
to the particle size of hydroxide compound is very tiny, 
therefore, the polyvalent metal ions (i.e., Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+) 
are utilized to form polynuclear hydrolyzed complexes and 
promote the settling of them. However, the hydrated 
particle is usually high specific surface, resulting in the 
water molecule is easily adsorbed on the particle surface. 
Even the sediment was dehydrated by press, the inner 
bonding water (i.e., capillary water and crystal water) is 
not released easily and the water content of the resulting 
sludge is usually higher than 80%. The high water content 
usually makes the volume or weight of sludge bulky. If the 
water content of sludge could be effectively decreased, the 
amount of sludge would be also decreased significantly. 
For instance, the water content of sludge which the bulk 
density is assumed 2 g/cm3 decreases from 85% down to 
60%, the volume of the latter is one-third of the former. In 
another word, the metal grade of the latter would be triple 
of the former that might promote feasibility for the waste 
reuse. The relationship of water content versus sludge 
volume (or weight) could be realized from Figure 1.                  
In general, the filter pressure or heat treatment was 
utilized in the previous studies to decrease the water 
content of the sludge, those methods would be little helpful 
for releasing some pore water and capillary water and the 
water content of the residue was only down to 75% [1-3]. 
The reason of poor dehydration efficiency might be high 
specific surface, hydrophilic surface and poor crystalline 
characteristic of the sludge. Therefore, some researchers 
focused on the crystal growth to promote the filtration 
efficiency and decrease the water content of the residue 
[4-5]. Therefore, this study focuses on waste reduction and 
resource recovery of sludge which used Al3+ as coagulant 
in the wastewater treatment. Owing to some valuable 
metals such as copper, zinc etc. also coexisted in the sludge, 
the metal grade of that would be effectively increased if the 
water content of treated sludge (i.e. residue) could be 
decreased greatly. According to the Eh-pH diagram of the 
binary system CuO-H2O at 250 C [6], copper oxide and 
even other metal are stable in alkaline solution, at the same 
time, the aluminum content might be dissolved in that. 
Therefore, alkaline leaching process was considered to 
dissolve the aluminum content of the sludge, and other 
metal species could be left in the residue. It is expected that 
the goals of waste reduction and concentrated metal 
content in the residue could be reached.   
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
2.1 Sludge Sample 
The binary synthetic wastewaters which the 
concentration of cupric ion was fixed at 500 ppm and other 
metal ions (i.e., Al3+, Zn2+, Ni2+ and Cr3+) were 4,000 ppm 
respectively were neutralized by 10 N NaOH and the pH 
was adjusted to pH = 8.00±0.10. Each suspension was 
filtered by vacuum filter until the vacuum condition was 
broken. The sludge cake was the raw material of the 
followed alkaline leaching process. 
 
 
 
 
would be possible if the ratio of [Al]/[Cu] was less than 0.1. 
The characteristics of specific filtration resistance and 
water content of residue are similar with the results of 
section 3.1 and were shown in the Table 2. Owing to the 
effect of aluminum might be occurred, the water content of 
the residue (i.e., 72.8%) is higher than the result of that (i.e., 
62.8%) in section 3.1. 
 
Figure 3 the effect of various ratios of copper and 
aluminum to the formation of mineral phase 
 
3.3 Alkaline leaching testing  
The binary synthetic wastewaters (i.e., Al/Cu, Zn/Cu, 
Ni/Cu and Cr/Cu) were neutralized with NaOH solution. 
The sediment was the raw material for alkaline leaching 
testing. The purpose of this testing is to realize the 
dissolution of metal content in alkaline solution and 
estimate the feasibility of selective leaching. From XRD 
analysis of each binary neutralized sludge sample is 
amorphous except Al/Cu and Zn/Cu. The reasons might be 
the aluminum sulfate supplied enough sulfate to form 
sodium sulfate and the Zn4SO4(OH)6․4H2O was formed 
in weak alkaline solution like Cu4SO4(OH)6. It is less help 
for the growth of oxide crystal when the synthetic sludge 
was leached in the alkaline solution of ambient temperature. 
Although the oxide phase of leached residue of ambient 
temperature was not obvious, nevertheless, the appearances 
of copper oxide and zinc oxide could be observed when 
mixtures were heated in the leaching testing.  
  The settling property could be promoted if the crystal 
characteristic is good. The interface level of Zn/Cu binary 
system was reacted at 70 degrees centigrade was down 
quickly. Good crystal characteristic is also helpful for the 
decrease of leached residue, therefore, the water content of 
the residue leached at 70 degrees centigrade is only 43.2% 
and the percentage of waste reduction is 86.5%. Although 
the major mineral phase of the leached residue in Al/Cu 
binary system is Al(OH)3, the water content and sludge 
reduction are 69.2% and 79.1% respectively. The amount 
of sludge reduction should be caused by the high water 
content of raw sludge. These results are shown in the Table 
3.  
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The sludge amount could be decreased greatly if the oxide 
compound phase is obvious to decrease the water content of 
the leached residue. The amphoteric property of aluminum 
content could be utilized in the alkaline leaching process to 
dissolve Al3+ from sludge coagulated by alum. It would 
promote greatly the sludge reduction and resource recovery. 
This technology could be set up behind the thickener in the 
future, and it might decrease the sludge volume and recover 
valuable resource.

Abstract: This study discussed the feasibility about the fraction of coarse grain municipal solid waste incinerator bottom 
ash with a particle size higher than 74.5 μm to form structural aggregate. The incinerator bottom ash (IBA) was 
water-extracted, sieved, crushed, wet ball-milled, dried, compaction pressured and sintering temperature from 800 to 1100 
℃. The result shows that the sintered sample compressive strength that reaches 268 kgf/cm2 could be used in recycling 
aggregate when the sintering temperature reached above 950 ℃ and architectural the test for soundness of 
aggregate-durability. Accompany the sintering temperature increased to 1060 ℃, the compressive strength also increased to 
approximately 1029 kgf/cm2. Above 1070℃, the melting phenomenon arose in the surface of sintered sample and reduced 
the compressive strength. Therefore, the coarse grain of municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash is a potential material 
to sintering as structural aggregate when the sintering temperature between 950 to 1060 ℃.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) is 
important to Taiwan where the population density is high 
and availability of landfill is limited. In 2005, 23 
incinerators were operating resulting in about 1,000,000 
tones of waste being disposed, and amounted 860,000 
tones of incinerator bottom ash (IBA). The Environmental 
Protection Administration of Taiwan regards IBA as 
non-hazardous industrial waste and can be directly 
disposed in incinerator ash landfill sites. However, 
considering the waste resource recycling, recycling of IBA 
is a topic of growing importance in the field of waste 
management. 
  IBA is a heterogeneous mix of materials such as brick, 
stone, glass, ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other 
non-combustible inorganic and residual organic matter.  
[1, 2] Many studies have been conducted on the utilization 
of waste as construction aggregates, as it provides a real 
potential for application of significant quantities of the 
wastes. [3] Due to its technical properties, municipal solid 
waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash may be reused as a 
road material. [4]  
This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of 
sintering coarse grain of IBA. The potential of such recycle 
product was assessed through the analysis of its physical, 
chemical, and engineering properties, in order to achieve 
the successful reutilization of MSWI bottom ash. 
 
2. EXPERIMENTS 
 
2.1. Materials 
The bottom ash of our research materials was first 
collected from one of the large-scale MSWI plants in 
Taipei County. Large pieces of metal were first removed 
and screening was conducted with a 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) 
sieve to filter out large un-combustible substances or 
impurities. The material obtained was mixed manually and 
used as the preliminary experimental material. 
 
2.2 Experimental Methods  
The treated bottom ash was then water washed to 
remove the constituents unsuitable to be sintered into 
aggregate. During water washing, the ratio of liquid/solid 
was set to be 1 (L/S = 1) and two five-minute washing 
stages were conducted. The material was then screened 
with an ASTM #200 (74.5 μm) sieve to separate the coarse 
grain bottom ash larger than #200 (74.5μm) from the rest. 
  The coarse grain bottom ash (CG BA) was crushed 
further using a jaw crusher to roughly 8 mm in diameter. 
Wet-ball milling was then conducted to further its 
homogenization, which lasted 12 hours. Ten grams of 
experimental materials powder was uniaxially pressed at 
70 kg/cm2, 50 kg/cm2 and 30 kg/cm2 using a stainless steel 
die, to form 2cm diameter and approximately 1.8 to 2.0 cm

3.3.2 Crystalline phase of sintered sample 
  The major crystalline phases of the CG BA and 
sintered sample at 850, 900, 950, 1000 and 1050 ℃  
are shown in Figure 5. The major crystalline phases 
identified in the CG BA were quartz (SiO2), calcite 
(CaCO3), hematite (Fe2O3), and calcium oxide (CaO). 
The result of these minerals is the same with 
chemical composition detected by ICP.  
  Analysis of the sintered sample at 1050 ℃ , 
diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was the principal crystalline 
phase, and amounts of clinoenstatite (MgSiO3), 
wollastonite (CaSiO3), and minor amounts of albite 
(NaAlSi3O8). The quartz and calcite peaks decreased 
and to form the diopside and wollastonite on 
increase sintered temperature.

3.3.3 Compressive strength 
 
  Compressive strengths were measured in accordance 
with Taiwan EPA NIEA R206.20T. Figure 6 shows 
compressive strength of the products at different sintering 
temperature. It indicated that the compressive strength was 
272.3025 kg/cm2 (powder compaction pressure was 
70kg/cm2) when the sintered temperature was 950℃. 
Compressive strength increases considerably as 
temperature rises from 1000 to 1060 ℃. However, the 
compressive strength decreases when the sintering 
temperature exceeds 1070 ℃, since it surpasses its melting 
point. 
  For the general application of aggregates, those with a 
compressive strength higher than 70 kg/cm2 are considered 
highly useful. Those with a compressive strength over 175 
kg/cm2 are high strength aggregates, which can be used in 
structural application. Such application can be utilized as 
aggregates in concrete for insulating purposes.
