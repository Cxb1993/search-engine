2the frequency domain and dynamic programming (DP) to reduce the complexity in searching. In addition,
an energy detector is employed due to insufﬁcient knowledge of statistics of EU signals.
The method we proposed to the second topic is active interference cancelation (AIC) technique. The
AIC technique has a good protection level for the primary system, but the disadvantages are the high
complexity due to matrix inversion in its LS solution [2] and its adoption of LS criterion only minimizes
the total residual powers at the null band. In our study, the AIC technique of [3] is improved along the
directions of complexity reduction and performance enhancement. On the complexity reduction, the LS
criterion in [3] is modiﬁed slightly so that the complexity of AIC technique is greatly reduced with little
performance loss. On the performance enhancement, the performance metric of [3] which minimizes the
total residual power in the null band is adjusted to minimize the largest residual power along the frequency.
II. 主題與成果
A. 主題 I: Spectrum Sensing
Consider a wideband cognitive OFDM system with Q subcarriers. When a sensing of EU systems is
performed, an EU signal is present at the frequency of subcarrier q, and the q-th DFT output corresponding
to the n-th OFDM symbol is given by
Yq(n) = Iq(n) + Vq(n), 0 6 q 6 Q− 1, (1)
where {Iq(n)} and {Vq(n)} are the complex-valued contributions resulting from EU signal and additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN), respectively. Suppose there are m EU systems operating in the frequency
band of interest, with the i-th system (1 ≤ i ≤ m) occupying the band extending from the qi,0-th to
the qi,1-th subcarriers of the CR OFDM system. The sensing algorithm in our study decides how many
EU systems and where they are based on the observation Yq(n) : 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1, 0 ≤ q ≤ Q− 1 with N
denoting the observation length at each subcarrier.
We process {Yq(n)} into two steps, the ﬁrst step is to estimate the number of EU systems in the band
and their frequency bands, and the second is to detect for each suspected band to decide whether or not
an EU system is in operation. Here, we use m to represent the number of EU systems and [qi,0, qi,1] to
represent their frequency bands, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. At the end of this topic, we will extend the results to
the case of multiple receive antennas.
1) Estimating Frequency Bands of EU Systems: We build an observation Z(q) from {Yq(n)}, n=1,2,. . .,N -
1, assume that the variances of Vq(n) in the real and imaginary parts are both
σ2V

, and choose
Z(q) =

N−1∑
n=0
(|Iq(n)|2 + |Vq(n)|2 + 2<{Iq(n)V ∗q (n)})− σ2V ,
(2)
with Yq = [Yq(0), Yq(1), . . . , Yq(N − 1)]T . It’s seen Y†qYq/N is the periodogram of the received signal
at the q-th subcarrier averaged over N OFDM symbols, and the periodogram is an estimate of the true
spectrum of a signal. The observation for EU system frequency bands estimation is Z0:Q−1, where we
deﬁne Za:b = [Z(a), Z(a+ 1), . . . , Z(b)]T .
We ﬁrst think of the case that there is one EU system, i.e. m = 1, operating in the target band at
subcarriers q ∈ [a, b]. Using the ﬁrst-order AR model to ﬁt the signal {Z(a), Z(a + 1), . . . , Z(b)}, we
have
Z(q) = βZ(q − 1) + η + ²1(q), a+ 1 6 q 6 b, (3)
where β and η are model parameters, and {²1(q)} is a white Gaussian random process with variance σ21 .
Since we have assumed m = 1, we use q0 and q1 to denote the starting and ending subcarrier indices of
the EU system. According to model (3), we can perform maximum likelihood estimation for q0 and q1
4Now we consider the situation that there are m EU systems with the i-th system operating at subcarriers
[qi,0, qi,1], and all of {[qi,0, qi,1] : 1 6 i 6 m} are disjoint. Hence, for a ﬁxed value of m, we can estimate
{qi,0, qi,1} by solving
min
qi,0,qq,1:16i6m
{δ0(0, q1,0 − 1)+
δ1(q1,0 + 1, q1,1) + δ0(q1,1 + 1, q2,0 − 1) + δ1(q2,0 + 1, q2,1)+
. . .+ δ1(qm,0 + 1, qm,1) + δ0(qm,1 + 1, Q− 1)}.
(10)
Similarly, we use DP to solve equation (10), and we ﬁnd that the computing complexity of DP only
increases linearly with m. Hence, computing complexity is changed from O(Q2m) into linear with m.
2) Detecting EU Signals: The detection stage is able to compensate for the errors made at the estimation
stage. We address the detection of EU signal in the band [q0, q1], and the adopted detection algorithms in
CR contain matched ﬁltering, energy detection, and cyclostationary signal feature detection [6]. Here, we
choose energy detection due to the lack of knowledge about EU signals. The detector is designated as
T =
q1∑
q=q0
N−1∑
n=0
|Yq(n)|2 ≷H1H0 γ, (11)
with H0 represents EU signal is absent, and H1 otherwise. Under H0, the scaled test statistic (2/σ2V ) · T
is a central chi-squared distribution with degree of freedom 2N(q1 − q0 + 1), i.e. χ22N(q1−q0+1). Using the
Neyman-Pearson philosophy, the detection threshold γ is set as
γ =

with the target false alarm probability PFA, whereQ−1χ2k
(x) is the inverse function of the right-tail probability
evaluated at x for distribution χ2k.
Suppose that an EU system is present, and its average power at the q-th subcarrier is denoted by Eq,
where Eq = 1N
∑N−1

By using central limit theorem, the distribution of the second and third terms at the right-hand side of
(13) can be approximated as N(σ2VN(q1 − q0 + 1), σ4VN(q1 − q0 + 1)) and N(0, 2σ2VN
∑q1
q=q0
Eq).
Thus, given a threshold γ, the probability of detection is
PD = Q

 . (14)
To relate the probability of miss PMD and the probability of false alarm, we set
γ ≈
√
σ4VN(q1 − q0 + 1)Q−1(PFA) + σ2VN(q1 − q0 + 1). (15)
Plugging the approximation of (15) back to (14), we obtain

6B. 主題 II: Transmit Spectrum Shaping
We consider a wideband CR system which adopts the OFDM modulation with N subcarriers, and
assume that the band of the primary system coincides with subcarriers from #v1 to #v2 of the CR
system. Here, we focus on how the power leakage of the OFDM based CR system on the primary system
can be suppressed. The AIC method which was proposed in [3] tunes the modulation of subcarriers from
#(v1 − γ1) to #(v2 + γ2) to minimize the transmit spectrum at the band of the primary network instead
of turning off a number of tones, where γ1 and γ2 depend on the level of interference that the primary
system can tolerate. We assume γ1 = γ2 = γ for notational simplicity.
Let X = [X(0), X(1), . . . , X(N−1)]T denote the information data of a CR user. Then, the time-domain
signal of a CR user is given as
x(n) =
N−1∑
k=0
X(k) exp(j2pi
n
N
k), 0 6 n 6 N − 1. (25)
Thus, spectrum in between X(0), X(1), . . . , X(N − 1) with a four-times up-sampling Y (l) is
Y (l) =
1

N−1∑
n=0

where
P (l, k) =
N−1∑
n=0
exp
(
j2pi

N
(
k − l

))
. (27)
According to (27), we deﬁne a 4N×N matrix P, whose (l, k)-th entry is P (l, k). We denote by P(l1,l2,...,lm)k1,k2,...,kn
an m× n matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is equal to the (li, kj)-th component of P, i.e.
[P(l1,l2,...,lm)k1,k2,...,kn ]i,j = P (li, kj), 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. (28)
In the AIC method, the AIC tones are obtained by solving
hAIC = argmin
h
‖P0g+ P1h‖2, (29)
where P0 and P1 are the small kernels derived from P corresponding to g and h, h = [X(v1− γ), X(v2+
γ), X(v1 − γ + 1), X(v2 + γ − 1), . . .]T are for the purpose of suppressing the sidelobes resulting from
g, and g = [X(0), . . . , X(v1 − γ − 1), X(v2 + γ + 1), . . . , X(N − 1))]T are the AIC tones which the
information data not included. The LS solution to equation (29) is
hAIC = −(PH1 P1)−1PH1 P0g. (30)
We proposed two AIC algorithms, one is statistical relation based AIC (SR-AIC) method, the other is
minimax optimization based AIC (M-AIC) method. Before describing the proposed AIC algorithms, we
simplify the expression of P (l, k) as
P (l, k) =
1

8III. 模擬與分析
Through the simulations, an OFDM CR with the number of subcarriers Q=128 is adopted, and the
observation length is set as N=100. When multiple antennas are used, channels from an EU to different
antennas are independent. Thus, diversity gain is obtained by the combining across K antennas (Fig. 1).
Now, we use m and M to denote the true number and chosen number of EU system in running (10).
A “hit” happens if each EU band is equal to some estimated EU band with one-subcarrier estimation
error tolerance at both sides. It is shown that the performance of estimation degrades as the number of
EU systems increases and the frequency selectivity of the channel deteriorates the performance as well
in Fig. 2, and Fig. 3 shows that the performance of estimation improves with the increase of K under
the same number of multipaths which is equal to 16. In Figs. 4 and 5, it is clearly that SR-AIC and
AIC have similar shapes of power spectra because of the same criterion of LS error is employed, and
M-AIC achieves a 5dB performance gain over the AIC method due to its minimax criterion. In the curves
with speciﬁer “x” in Fig. 6, we compare the averaged LS error per sample in the four-times up-sampled
spectrum versus the width of null band from 5 to 35 tones for NAP = 4. When we concerned with the
LS error, the AIC method performs the best, and M-AIC is the worst. We show another more reasonable
criterion of minimizing the maximal residual power levels at the null band in the curves with speciﬁer
“+” in Fig. 6, where the maximal residual power levels versus 5 ≤ Nnull ≤ 35 for NAP = 4 is depicted.
In terms of this measure, M-AIC obviously outperforms AIC and SR-AIC, while AIC and SR-AIC have
similar null depths.
IV. 研究自評
In this year of project, our goals are to enhance the performance of spectrum sensing and formulate
new method based on the AIC technique to achieve lower complexity and better performance. On the
spectrum sensing, we use an AR model to track the variation of the received EU signal strength along
the frequency axis, employing an energy detector to test the suspected bands, and investigate the scenario
of multiple antennas to enhance the performance of spectrum sensing. On the transmit spectrum shaping,
we propose two methods. SR-AIC have the same performance as AIC but the complexity is lower, and
M-AIC does better at both performance and complexity than AIC.
