  
tion,23 can be neglected.  Under the same conditions, 
Zhang et al.24 and Hsu et al.25,26 investigated further 
the boundary effect on the electrophoretic behavior of 
a soft particle by considering the electrophoresis of a 
soft toroid30 and a sphere24,26 along the axis of a cy-
lindrical pore.  Yeh et al.27 analyzed the electropho-
resis of a membrane-coated cylinder positioned ec-
centrically along the axis of a cylindrical pore for the 
case of arbitrary double-layer thickness, which is a 
three-dimensional problem.  Taking the effect of 
DLP, which usually retards the particle motion, into 
account, Saville28 and Hill et al.29 studied the electro-
phoresis of an isolated soft spherical particle in an 
unbounded electrolyte solution.  It was found that 
the effect of DLP can be significant when the charge 
density of a soft particle is high.  Those analyses 
were extended by Lee et al.30 to take the effect of par-
ticle concentration into account. The influence of a 
boundary on the electrophoretic behavior of a soft 
sphere for the case of an arbitrary level of surface 
potential, where applying a nonlinear Pois-
son-Boltzmann equation to describe the electrical 
potential is necessary, was analyzed by several inves-
tigators through considering various geometries.31-33 
  Two types of soft particle have been considered in 
previous theoretical studies. For convenience, we 
define type I soft particle as the one with a charged 
rigid core having a constant surface potential and an 
ion-penetrable porous layer,20-22,26-33 and type II soft 
particle as the one with an uncharged rigid core and a 
polyelectrolyte membrane layer.16-19,24,25 Note that a 
Neumann type of boundary condition, imposing a 
zero charge density on the surface of the rigid core of 
a particle, is applied in case of type II soft particle. 
Therefore, the electrical potential on that surface, 
known as Donnan potential,12,16 varies with the phys-
icochemical properties of the membrane layer of the 
particle and the electrolyte concentration. This model 
predicts that the electrophoretic mobility of a particle 
decreases with decreasing double layer thickness.19 
This is consistent with the behavior of biocolloids 
such as cells, proteins, microorganisms, and inorganic 
particle covered by a biological membrane lay-
er.13,15,34,35 On the other hand, a Dirichlet type of 
boundary condition, imposing a constant potential on 
the surface of the rigid core of a particle, is applied in 
the case of type I soft particle. In this case, the elec-
trophoretic mobility of a particle increases with de-
creasing double layer thickness, in general.20-22,26-33  
Taking the effect of DLP into account, the influ-
ence of a boundary on the electrophoretic behavior of 
a soft biocolloid (type II soft particle) is investigated 
in this study by considering the electrophoresis of a 
soft sphere in a spherical cavity.  This geometry was 
adopted by Zydney31 to simulate the electrophoresis 
of a rigid sphere in a porous medium. The electro-
phoretic mobility of the particle under various condi-
tions is examined in detail through varying the thick-
ness of double layer, the position of the particle in the 
cavity, the properties of the membrane layer of the 
particle, and the size of the cavity. Since the position 
of the particle is arbitrary, the geometry considered is 
capable of simulating more realistically the experi-
ments in practice, such as the characterization of bio-
colloids by capillary electrophoresis13,34,35 and the 
electrophoretic translocation of protein37,38 and 
DNA,6-8 through a nanopore. This study is also aimed 
to provide theoretical background for the interpreta-
tion of the dependence of the electrophoretic mobility 
of biocolloids on salt concentration usually observed 
in experiments. 
 
三、理論 
  The problem under consideration is illustrated in 
Fig. 1, where a soft sphere of radius a comprising a 
rigid core of radius (a-c) and an ion-penetrable mem-
brane layer of thickness c at an arbitrary position in a 
spherical cavity of radius b is driven by an applied 
uniform electric field E of strength E  in the 
z-direction. The cylindrical coordinates, r, θ , z, are 
adopted with the origin located at the center of the 
cavity, and the center of the particle is at z=m. Let 
baΛ /=  and )]/([%100 abmM −×=  be the relative 
size of the cavity and the relative position of the par-
ticle, respectively. Note that the larger the Λ  or M 
the more important the boundary effect is.  The cav-
ity is filled with an aqueous, incompressible Newto-
nian fluid containing z1:z2 electrolytes with z1 and z2 
being the valences of cations and of anions, respec-
tively. 
  If we let φ , jn , p, and v be the electrical potential, 
the number concentration of ionic species j, the pres-
sure, and the fluid velocity relative to the particle, 
respectively, then, because the present problem is 
θ -symmetric, the electric, the concentration, and the 
flow fields of the present problem can be described

  Instead of solving the original problem directly, 
two hypothetical sub-problems are solved, which is 
capable of avoiding a tedious trial-and-error proce-
dure arising from the unknown electrophoretic veloc-
ity in the boundary conditions.18 In the first 
sub-problem the particle moves with a constant veloc-
ity U in the absence of E, and in the second 
sub-problem E is applied but the particle is held fixed. 
The electrophoretic velocity of the particle can be 
evaluated from a balance of the forces acting on it.  
These include mainly the electrical force and the hy-
drodynamic force and, due to the geometric nature of 
the present problem, only the z-components of these 
forces, eF  and dF , respectively, need be evaluated. 
It can be shown that eF  and dF  can be evaluated 
respectively by integrating the Maxwell stress tensor

四、結果與討論 
  The governing equations and the associated bound-
ary conditions are solved numerically by FlexPDE 
(version 4.24, PDE Solutions, Spokane Valley, WA), 
which is based on a finite-element method. Grid in-
dependence is checked throughout numerical calcula-
tions and, in general, using a total of ca. 28,000 and 
3,400 nodes are sufficient for the resolution of the 
electric field and the flow field, respectively. The 
numerical scheme and its implementation using 
FlexPDE have been validated to be efficient and suf-
ficiently accurate for solving similar boundary-value 
problems.24-27,39  
  In subsequent discussions, the influences of the key 
parameters of the present problem, including the 
thickness of double layer, the properties of the mem-
brane layer of the particle, and the size and the posi-
tion of the particle on its electrophoretic behavior are 
examined in detail through numerical simulation.  
Unless otherwise specified, we let Pe1=Pe2=0.1,42 
which is usually assumed in relevant electrokinetic 
studies for the case where the effect of DLP can be 
significant.  We focus on type II soft particles, that is, 
biocolloids. 
Influence of double layer thickness and fixed 
charged density of membrane layer 
Fig. 2 presents the simulated variations of the 
scaled electrophoretic mobility of a particle, *μ , and 
the corresponding scaled forces acting on the particle 
in the second sub-problem, *2eF , 
*
2dF , 
*
2F  
( *2
*
2 de FF += ), as a function of the scaled double 
layer thickness, aκ , at various values of *Q .  Here, 
because we fix the radius of the particle a, the varia-
tion of aκ  comes from that of the bulk electrolytes 
concentration.  As seen in Fig. 2a, the qualitative 
behavior of *μ  depends largely on the level of *Q . 
If *Q  is small, then *μ  decreases monotonically 
with increasing aκ . However, if *Q  is sufficiently 
large (e.g., 50* −=Q ), then as aκ  varies, *μ  has a 
local minimum occurring at 5.1≅κa . The occurrence 
of the local minimum in *μ  can be explained by the 
following. At smaller values of aκ , the membrane 
layer of the particle is enclosed by the double layer. In 
this case, an increase in aκ  (decrease in double layer 
  
inside (outside) the particle, making the clockwise 
electroosmotic retardation flow (the flow of counte-
rions) around the particle more pronounced and, 
therefore, the greater the *
)(,2 vdF , 
*
)(,2 pdF , and 
*
2dF .  We conclude that for the present type of soft, 
biocolloidal particle (type II soft particle), the influ-
ence of *Q  on the behavior of *μ  as aκ  varies is 
dominated mainly by the electrical driving force com-
ing from E.  This is different from the case of a 
membrane-coated soft particle (type I soft particle) in 
the literature,20-22,26-33 where that behavior is domi-
nated by the competition between the electrical driv-
ing force and the electroosmotic retardation force 
*
2dF .
27  Note that the larger the 
fixQ  the more sig-
nificant the effect of DLP, making the presence of the 
local minimum in *μ  occurring at 1≅κa  more 
pronounced. 
 
Influence of softness of membrane layer 
  The influence of the friction coefficient (or softness) 
of the membrane layer of a particle, measured by aλ , 
on its scaled electrophoretic mobility *μ  is illus-
trated in Fig. 5; the corresponding scaled forces, *2eF , 
*
2dF , and 
*
iF  (
**
diei FF += ) acting on the particle are 
also presented. It is interesting to note that the quali-
tative behavior of *μ  depends highly upon the level 
of aλ . If aλ  is small, the influence of the effect of 
DLP on the electrophoretic behavior of the soft parti-
cle is significant. In this case, *μ  has a local mini-
mum occurring at a aκ  in the range [1.0,2.0] , which 
is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 2. On the 
other hand, if aλ  is large, then that effect becomes 
insignificant. In this case, *μ  is seen to decreases 
with increasing aκ , which is unexpected. These be-
haviors can be explained by the variations of *2eF  
and *
2dF  shown in Fig. 5b.  This figure indicates 
that *2eF  is uncorrelated with aλ , and *2eF  de-
creases with increasing aκ . In addition, if aλ  is 
small, then *
2dF  is negative and 
*
2dF  increases 
monotonically with increasing aκ . If aλ  is suffi-
ciently large, then *
2dF  is negative at small values of 
aκ , passing through a negative local minimum near 
1≅κa , and then becomes positive if aκ  is suffi-
ciently large. These imply that, if aλ  is small, the 
electroosmotic retardation flow arising from the mo-
tion of the counterions in the double layer due to E 
enhances the effect of DLP. On the other hand, if aλ  
is large, that flow offsets the effect of DLP, making 
the local minimum of *μ  at 1≅κa  disappears. 
That *
2dF  can be positive seen in Fig. 5b is also ob-
served in the electrophoresis of a negatively charged, 
rigid sphere towards a large disk.46 Fig. 5a also re-
veals that if aκ  is large, then *μ  decreases with 
increasing aλ , but the reverse trend is observed if 
aκ  is small.  The former is also observed in the 
other similar electrophoresis problems,26-33 where type 
I soft particle is simulated, and can be explained by 
that the larger the aλ  the greater the friction force 
coming from the membrane layer.  The later has not 
been reported previously, and can be explained by the 
competition between *1F  and 
*
2F  as aλ  varies, 
shown in Fig. 5c.  As seen in this figure, if aκ  is 
small, then the rate of decrease in *
1F  with increas-
ing aλ  is always faster than that in *2F , yielding a 
monotonic increase in *μ  with increasing aλ .  
We conclude that the friction coefficient of the mem-
brane layer of the present type of soft particle is capa-
ble of influencing both quantitatively and qualita-
tively its electrophoretic behavior. 
 
Influence of the thickness of membrane layer 
  The influence of the thickness of the membrane 
layer of a particle on its electrophoretic behavior is 
illustrated in Fig. 6a and b, and the corresponding 
variations of the scaled forces, *2eF , 
*
2dF , and 
*
2F  
( *2
*
2 de FF += ) for the case of Fig. 6b are presented in 
Fig. 6c.  As seen in Fig. 6a, the qualitative behavior 
of the scaled mobility *μ  as aκ   varies depends 
highly upon the scaled membrane thickness (c/a). If 
(c/a) is small, then *μ  decreases monotonically 
with increasing aκ . On the other hand, if (c/a) is 
large, then *μ  has a local minimum occurring at 
7.1≅κa . Again, these behaviors arise from the com-
petition between the electrical driving force and the 
electroosmotic retardation force. For the present case, 
because the volume of the membrane layer of the par-
ticle increases with increasing (c/a), so are the amount 
of fixed charge and the associated electrical driving 
force. Therefore, the larger the (c/a) the higher the 
electrical potential, the more significant the effect of 
DLP and, therefore, the more apparent the presence of 
the local minimum in aκ . Fig. 6b shows the varia-
tions of *μ  as a function of (c/a) at varies values of 
aκ . Note that if aκ  is large, then *μ  increases 
monotonically with increasing (c/a). On the other 
hand, if it is small, *μ  increases with increasing 
(c/a) first, and then approaches a constant value as 
(c/a) gets large. Fig. 6b and c reveals that the qualita-
tive behaviors of *μ  are similar to those of *2F , 
implying that the behaviors of *μ  as aκ  and (c/a) 
vary depend upon the result of the competition be-
tween *2eF  and 
*
2dF .  If aκ  is sufficiently small 
(double layer is sufficiently thick), then the behavior 
of *μ  as (c/a) varies is dominated by *2eF .  On the 
other hand, if aκ  is sufficiently large (double layer 
is sufficiently thin), then that behavior is dominated 
by *2eF  when (c/a) is small, and by 
*
2dF  when (c/a) 
  
flow surrounding the particle.  As illustrated in Fig. 
7c, where the boundary effect is relatively unimpor-
tant ( Λ =0.2), if aκ  is small, then *)(,2 vdF >0 and 
*
),(2 pdF <0, and the later dominates the behavior of 
*
2dF , which is negative.  However, if aκ  becomes 
large, the electroosmotic retardation flow becomes 
significant and dominates the behaviors of *
)(,2 vdF , 
*
),(2 pdF , and 
*
2dF .  The positive 
*
)(,2 vdF  arises from 
that the maximum velocity of the electroosmotic re-
tardation flow occurs at a point outside the particle.  
This is because if Λ  is small, then the overlapping 
of the double layer surrounding the particle with the 
cavity is insignificant.  In this case, the rate of strain 
across the particle surface is positive when aκ  is 
small, and increases with increasing aκ , as can be 
verified by Fig. 8a and b.  However, if aκ  is suffi-
ciently large, then the rate of strain across the particle 
surface becomes negative due to that the maximum 
velocity is pushed into the membrane layer of the 
particle, yielding negative *
)(,2 vdF  and 
*
2dF , as illus-
trated in Fig. 8c.  This is why *2dF  shows a posi-
tive local maximum in Fig. 7b as aκ  varies.  
Therefore, if the boundary effect is significant (large 
Λ ), then because the electrophoretic behavior of a 
particle is dominated by the electrical driving force, 
the influence of the effect of DLP on the qualitative 
behavior of *μ  is enhanced, although the larger the 
Λ  the less significant that effect is.  On the other 
hand, if the boundary effect is insignificant (small 
Λ ), then the electrophoretic behavior of a soft parti-
cle depends upon both the electrical driving force and 
the hydrodynamic force coming from the electroos-
motic retardation flow.  This implies that the former 
influence can be offset by the latter one, and therefore, 
*μ  decreases with increasing aκ .   
     Fig. 9a shows the variations of the scaled elec-
trophoretic mobility *μ  as a function of aκ  at var-
ious values of M , and the corresponding variations 
of the scaled forces in the second sub-problem, *2eF , 
*
2dF , 
*
2F , are presented in Fig. 9b.  As seen in Fig. 
9a, *μ  has a local minimum for aκ  in the range 
[1.0,2.0], which is consistent with the result shown in 
Fig. 2a, and can be explained by the similar reasoning.  
It is interesting to note that the larger the M  the less 
appreciable the presence of that local minimum in 
*μ .  Similar to the reasoning employed in the dis-
cussion of Fig. 7, this phenomenon arises from that as 
M  increases, the effect of DLP is alleviated by the 
depression of the flow field surrounding the particle 
by the boundary and by the increase in the amount of 
coions inside the membrane layer of the particle due 
to the overlapping of the double layer surrounding the 
particle and the cavity, and *
2eF  increases accord-
ingly, as seen in Fig. 9b.  Fig. 9b also reveals that if 
M  is small, then because the DLP effect is signifi-
cant *2F  is dominated by 
*
2eF .  On the other hand, 
if M  is large, then because that effect is insignifi-
cant, both *2eF  and 
*
2dF  can contribute comparably 
to *2F .  The dependence of the effect of DLP on Λ  
and M  can be illustrated by the contours of the net 
perturbed ionic concentration difference, )( 21 nn δδ − , 
shown in Fig. 10.  This figure shows that the larger 
the Λ  and/or M , because the more significant the 
boundary effect is, the less significant the effect of 
DLP.  It should be pointed out that this is the first 
attempt in the literature to show the evidence for the 
influence of a boundary on the effect of DLP and on 
the electrophoretic behavior of type II soft particles. 
 
Verification with experimental data 
  For illustration, it is adopted to describe the ex-
perimental data of López-Viota et al.,35 where the 
electrophoresis of creatine-covered gold nanoparticles 
of radius 15 nm, comprising a rigid gold core of ra-
dius 10.5 nm and an ion-penetrable membrane layer 
of thickness 4.5 nm,35 in an aqueous NaCl solution 
was conducted (see Fig. 11). To avoid the influence 
of the boundary, Λ  (=a/b) is assumed a small value 
of 0.08.41 The present theoretical model predicts suc-
cessfully the general trend of the mobility of the par-
ticle. If the fixed charge density of the membrane 
layer of a particle is sufficiently high, then the effect 
of DLP on its electrophoretic behavior becomes sig-
nificant. This yields an extra local minimum in its 
mobility, which occurs at a moderate high electrolyte 
concentration (i.e., medium large aκ ). The present 
analysis is capable of providing a sound interpretation 
of the general electrophoretic behaviors of soft bio-
colloids that is essential to the design of an electro-
phoresis device.
