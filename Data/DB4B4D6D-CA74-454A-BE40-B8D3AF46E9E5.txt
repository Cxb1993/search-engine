can defense different levels of error occurs. 
 
The security of 1D barcodes is lower than 2D barcodes. 1D barcodes are very easy to read by 
scanning the lines and the spaces. However, 2D barcodes are not easy to read a symbol pattern 
by human eyes. With regard to readability, 1D barcodes must scan along a single directional. If 
the angle of a scan line does not fit within a range, the data would not be read correctly. However, 
2D barcodes get wide ranges of angles for scanning. Thus, 2D barcodes are readability. 
 
2D Barcodes provide a unique identifier for objects and applications [1][9][10][11] [12][13][14][15] 
to automatic checkout system, commerce, industry, hospital, and etc. Barcodes are very 
convenience to automatic systems, but they have data privacy weakness. A reader device with 
video capture function can read the content from tags directly. When barcodes contain privacy 
information may result in the risk of security issue. Therefore, the confidential data is often stored 
in the back-end database. When a reader captures a tag, it only gets a network link from a tag 
and later connected to the back-end database through the Internet. A user who has access right 
can login database to retrieve the privacy information.

To enhance security of data privacy [3] of barcodes, we design a secret sharing technique with 
Quick Response code (QR code). The technique shares a confidential data into shadows and 
one shadow is embedded into one carrier tag. Anyone cannot recovery the original secret data 
from its own share. The secret can be recovered only when the number of shadows is larger than 
or equal to a threshold. The proposed technique does not need to connect the back-end 
database through Internet. Thus, the proposed technique can save much more hardware cost 
and can reduce the security risks transmission on the open environment. 
 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, we review the QR code. The 
proposed technique is described in Section 3. The security analysis and performance is listed in 
Section 4.  Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 5. 
 
2. QR CODE 
The QR code is a kind of matrix symbol, which was developed by the Japanese company 
Denson-Wave in 1994. Figure 1 shows the basic structure of QR code. They are quiet zone, 
position detection patterns, separators for position detection patterns, timing patterns, alignment 
patterns, format information, version information, data, and error correction codewords. They are 
shown in Figure 1. Some details of QR code can be refereed to [17].

FIGURE 2: The framework of the proposed scheme. 
 
In the proposed scheme, we first choose a value t (t<=n) and a secret key a0 and a large prime 
number p (p>=a0). Next, we select n participants x1, x2, ..., xn, where n is the number of QR code 
tags, which used to be hidden. Next, a (t-1) degree polynomial f(x) was constructed as follows: 
 
1 2 1
0 1 2 1( ) ... (mod )ttf x a a x a x a x p−−= + + + +
 (1) 
 
Where a1, a2, …, at-1∈ Zp. So, we can generate a pair of secret share (xi, f(xi)=yi) to each 
participant. 
 
In the decoding procedure, anyone who gets t out of n secret shares would recovery secret data 
a0 by the Lagrange polynomial interpolation which was listed as belows.

Here we illustrate an example to show how to construct secret shares. Let t value is 3, n value is 
6, secret key a0 is 1234 and the prime number p is 1237. Then a (t-1) degree polynomial 
f(x)=94x2+166x+1234 is constructed. Assume x1=1, x2=2, x3=3, x4=4, x5=5, and x6=6, we can 
obtain six secret shares where f(x1)=f(1)=1494, f(x2)=f(2)=1942, f(x3)=f(3)=2578, f(x4)=f(4)=3402, 
f(x5)=f(5)=4414, and f(x6)=f(6)=5614. To recover the secret key a0, we need to collect three or 
more secret shares. Assume we obtain three secret shares, they are (f(2), 1942), (f(4), 3402), 
(f(5), 4414). Then the secret key a0=1234 can be decoded by the Lagrange polynomial 
interpolation as below.
