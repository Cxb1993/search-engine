1. Introduction: 
Because of its relative low construction cost, slab-column framed system is very popular in 
current practice. However, the building code (ACI 318 Committee, 2011) explicitly prohibits 
the use of slab-column frames as part of lateral-support system in high seismic region due to 
its low lateral stiffness and potential punching shear failure. As a result, slab-column frames 
are generally served as gravity-support systems in high seismic regions and stiffer members 
such as shear wall or moment resisting frames shall be incorporated to resist seismic loadings. 
For this purpose, capability of sustaining designed gravity load when subjected to induced 
lateral displacement becomes a critical design issue for slab-column framed systems. 
 
Post-earthquake evidences showed that slab-column framed systems are susceptible to 
punching shear failure at the connection. Several researchers proved that gravity level has 
significant impact on the deformation capacities (Pan and Moehle, 1989; Robertson and 
Durrani, 1991 and 1992). A bilinear relationship between gravity load level and deformation 
capacity is given in the ACI Building Code (ACI 318 Committee, 2011), as shown in Fig. 1.1. 
It indicates that deformation capacity of the connection decreases as the level of gravity load 
increases. First presented in 2005 ACI Building Code (ACI 318 Committee, 2005), this curve 
is proposed by ACI 318 Committee based on several test results. However, most of those test 
results are interior slab-column connections. Another issue may be found when performing 
shear demand calculation at the corner connection (Ghali, 1989). Different approaches are 
adopted by different commercial software such as ADAPT-Builder (ADAPT Corporation, 
2005) and Decon-STDesign (Decon Inc., 2009).   
 
In this research, design criteria of corner slab-column connection in current ACI Building 
Code (ACI 318 Committee, 2011) are examined. Two approximately full-scaled corner slab-
column subassemblages were tested under combined gravity load and lateral displacement 
reversals. Test parameter between two specimens is the gravity shear ratio, defined as the 
gravity load divided by the code-specified punching shear capacity.  Experimental results 
suggest that modifications of design criteria are needed.  
 
2. Research Objectives: 
This research is aimed to review the validity of punching shear design criteria on corner slab-
column connections. Two approximately full-scaled corner slab-column subassemblages are 
tested.  
 
3. Literature Review: 
The current ACI Building Code (ACI Committee 318, 2011) provides two alternative design 
procedures for slab-column connections not designed as part of lateral-force-resisting systems 
for structures under seismic design categories D, E and F ( ASCE/SEI 7, 2010). Throughout 
this report, the first design procedure is referred as “strength check procedure” and the second 
is referred as “deformation check procedure.”  
3.1 Strength Check Procedure 
In “strength check procedure,” connection shear demand uV  evaluated at the critical section, 
a perimeter located at 2d  distance away from the column face as shown in Fig. 3.1, should 
not exceed the connection shear capacity cVφ ; otherwise, shear reinforcement should be 
3 
 
 
The vγ  term is an empirical expression used to determine the fraction of moment transferred 
by eccentricity of shear. Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 326 (1962) originally suggested a 
constant value of 0.2 which was developed based on statistical analysis from the test results 
of 24 interior and one edge slab-column connections. In 1968, Hanson and Hanson (1968) 
evaluated the test results of slab-column connections including the results from Moe (1961) 
and proposed a new vγ value of 0.4. From these test results, only one exterior connection was 
included; the same edge connection referred in ACI-ASCE Committee 326 (1962). Instead of 
using a fix value, 1971 ACI Building Code (ACI Committee 318, 1971) provided a practical 
equation in determining vγ in order to consider the column rectangularity and has remained 
unchanged since then. The expression for vγ is defined as

bv +
−=γ
(Eq. 3-5)
where 1b and 2b  are the dimensions of the critical section parallel and transverse to the 
direction of moment transfer, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3-1. 
3.2 Deformation Check Procedure 
In the “deformation check procedure,” Eq. (3-4) shall be evaluated at the “gravity-load-only,” 
a condition similar to the first step of the “strength check procedure.” Again, it is necessary to 
have punching shear demand uV  not exceed the punching shear capacity of the connection
cVφ ; otherwise shear reinforcement must be designed.  
 
Once the “gravity-load-only” requirements were met, design story drift shall be checked with 
the maximum allowable value which is related to the magnitude of cug VV φ  as specified in 
Section 21.13.6(b) of the current ACI Building Code (ACI Committee 318, 2011). This 
provision is illustrated by a bilinear graph in Fig. 1.1. Minimum shear reinforcement should 
be provided if the value corresponding to design drift ratio and cug VV φ falls above the 
bilinear curve of Fig 1.1. The amount of shear reinforcement in the final design is to be 
decided from the larger requirement between “gravity-load-only” and “design displacement” 
conditions. 
3.3 Ductility Requirements  
Connection ductility is the key concept learned from the experiences of previous earthquakes 
(Robertson and Johnson, 2006) in which slab-column connections designed for gravity-load-
only failed in a brittle manner during lateral deformations. The concept of ductility was 
roughly introduced in the 1971 ACI Building Code (ACI Committee 318, 1971). 
 
Based from the test result of four interior slab-column connections, Pan and Moehle (1989) 
concluded that the lateral displacement capacity and ductility of slab-column connections are 
highly dependent on the gravity shear ratio. Pan and Moehle (1989) suggested a gravity shear 
ratio of 0.4 to ensure that the connection can sustain the minimum drift capacity of 1.5 
percent. Under severe seismic loading, a 1.5 percent drift is thought to be a reasonable upper 
bound (Pan and Moehle, 1988; Sozen, 1980) for reinforced concrete structures. Luo and 
Durrani (1995) suggested a drift-based punching shear failure model based on regression 
analysis and was later revised by Hueste and Wight (1999). The bilinear model shown in Fig. 
5 
 
Specimen G1 shows a good performance under cyclic loading condition as presented in its 
lateral load versus drift relationship in Fig. 5.1. The peak lateral load reached to about 6.9 
kips (30.7 kN) at 1.75 percent drift and dropped by about 30 percent at 3.00 percent drift. 
During the application of the desired gravity load, flexure cracks started to appear at the 
bottom of the slab. Signs of torsional stresses started to appear at 0.25 percent drift and 
became more obvious at higher drifts. Wider inclined cracks are already visible at the side of 
the slab at 2.00 percent drift and no significant crack propagation thereafter.  Concrete cover 
spalled off at 2.50 percent drift.   
   
Specimen G2 on the other hand failed suddenly before imposing lateral displacement. It 
failed due to punching shear. Closer investigation of the specimen showed that the slab was 
fully disintegrated from the column. Bottom longitudinal reinforcements performed well in 
preventing progressive collapse in specimen G2.  
 
5.2 Shear Stress Discussion   
Specimen G1 performed a very ductile behavior as presented in Fig. 5.2. It reached an 
ultimate punching shear of about dbf oc
'8.3 at 2.00 percent drift as shown in Fig. 5.2; 
slightly lower than the code-specified-punching shear capacity. Theoretical analysis shows 
that point C of the critical section suffered the highest shear stress. The gravity shear ratio 
versus drift relationship of Specimen G1 shown in Fig. 5.3 provides a value above the 
bilinear curve implying a satisfactory deformation capacity as per ACI Building Code 
provisions.  
 
Specimen G2 which was subjected to a higher gravity loading failed in a very brittle manner. 
Its peak ultimate punching shear only reached to about dbf oc
'5.2  and sudden loss of strength 
occurred thereafter as shown in Fig. 5.4.  
 
Based from the gravity load versus drift relationships of Specimens G1 and G2 presented in 
Fig. 5.3, it shows that the corresponding allowable gravity shear gV to sustain a 1.5 percent 
drift falls slightly lower than the code-specified value. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Two identical full-scale isolated corner slab-column subassemblages were tested under cyclic 
lateral loading with different magnitudes of gravity shear applied on the slab. Based from the 
experimental results of both specimens, the following conclusions were drawn: 
1. The magnitude of gravity shear essentially degrades the deformation capacity of the 
connection.   
2. The punching shear capacity specified in current ACI Building Code may be 
unconservative when applied to corner slab-column connections. Based on limited 
test results, a '2 cf (psi) shear stress capacity is suggested.   
3. The validity of applying code-specified bilinear interaction curve between gravity 
shear ratio and lateral drift on corner slab-column connections requires further review. 
Based from the experimental results, an upper bound of '5.1 cf (psi) gravity shear is 
suggested for corner slab-column connections to ensure minimum deformation 
capacity.

1. Call to Order and Introductions 
 Committee 352 Chair Mary Beth Hueste called the meeting to order at approximately 
2:04p, after distributing copies of the meeting agenda.  All individuals in the meeting room 
then introduced themselves. 
 
2. Approval of Minutes from the Spring 2011 Committee 352 Meeting 
 A motion (by Luis Garcia, seconded by Loring Wyllie) was made to approve the 
Spring 2011 meeting minutes (from the convention held in Tampa, Florida), which had 
previously been posted to the committee website and were also available in hard copy format 
at the meeting.  No additional discussion was requested and the motion was approved by 
acclamation. 
 
3. Results of Ballot for the Response to Second Set of TAC Reviews for the Revised 
and Updated Slab-Column Connection Design Recommendations Report 
 Chair Hueste reported the result of the ACI 352 Ballot for the response to the second 
set of TAC reviews that was held between July 15, 2011 and August 15, 2011. The result was 
21 affirmative votes, 3 affirmative votes with comments and 9 votes not returned, which met 
both the 1/2 and 2/3 rules. The updated information and the committee’s response to the TAC 
comments were sent back to TAC, and Chair Hueste has not heard from TAC yet about the 
status.  Jim LaFave thanked every participant in the revision of the ACI 352 Slab-Column 
Connections Report.  Mary Beth Hueste also thanked the editorial subcommittee for their 
hard work and every member who participated. 
 
 ACTION ITEM:  The subcommittee will update the committee regarding TAC’s response 
to the final submission of the document and committee response. 
 
4. Update on Development of Slab-Column Connection Examples 
 Kara Hartleib updated the committee on the Slab-Column Connection Examples.  An 
example of a Type 1 post-tensioned connection will be added, with pre-existing examples of 
No. 1, 2, 4 and 5 directly included after a careful revision, as summarized in the table below.    
Kara reported that to date two of the older examples have been revised and the task group is 
making progress.  Possible ballots for four examples can be made before the 2012 Spring 
based on the ACI 318-11 Code for now, and that the report will be updated later to adopt the 
new section numbers when the 2014 Edition of the ACI 318 Code is available.  
 
 Jim LaFave raised the question as to whether the committee might want to review 
Appendix A of ACI 352R-02 (Areas Needing Research) and decide if the items can be 
included in the newer document.  Loring Wyllie mentioned that the list in Appendix A of ACI 
352R-02 was provided to stimulate research because at the time when the first report was 
available, there was not much research available.  Mary Beth suggested reviewing the items 
in Appendix A and finding any potential updates on these topics that may be appropriate to 
include in the report. 
 
 Thomas Kang and Gustavo Parra briefly reported that Task Groups TG2A (Headed 
Reinforcement) and TG2D (Fiber Reinforced Beam-Column Connections) continued to make 
some progress but there was not much to report at this time.  Additionally, it was noted that a 
tendency of decreased length of beam and column bars, which might be linked to fiber-
reinforced concrete performance, might need to be considered in the 352 document update.  
 
 Shyh-Jiann Hwang updated the committee on the progress of Task Groups TG2B 
(Effective Joint Area) and TG2C (High-Strength Materials). Shyh-Jiann mentioned that Task 
Group TG2A was working on the Concrete International article regarding the revision of the 
effective joint width, which will be circulated within the 352 committee for review once the 
draft is completed. Shyh-Jiann also made a presentation about the task group’s progress, 
and summarized that the effective joint width that TG2B proposes is much more reliable and 
efficient, compared with the joint widths of ACI 318-08, 352R-02, and New Zealand and 
Japan Codes (NZS 1995 and AIJ 1999).  A handful of questions were asked. Roberto Leon 
asked a question as to what was the impetus and justification of the proposed change and 
added a comment that the coefficient of variations among the different models seem to be 
similar.  Shyh-Jiann answered that the current 352 design recommendation is problematic 
primarily for eccentric beam-column joints.  Jim LaFave also noted that the means and 
coefficient of variations for the proposed model are improved for all types of connections.  
Thomas Kang asked if the task group would consider revising the effective joint depth and 
Shyh-Jiann answered that practical engineers do not like that idea and therefore the task 
group no longer considers it, though the language will ensure that the bar extends toward 
the end of the joint. 
 
 Shyh-Jiann Hwang also reported that Task Group TG2C compiled 110 specimens with 
high-strength materials in total, but without transverse beams and/or slabs and without 
eccentricity.  The task group assessed the specimens’ failure modes, yield drifts, drifts at 
failure and ductility and tentatively found that the current 352 joint shear strength seems to 
be okay for connections with high-strength materials.  Additionally, he mentioned that new 
tests with high-strength materials will be conducted in the NCREE laboratory.  In response to 
the questions Gustavo Parra asked, Shyh-Jiann confirmed that the drift ratio was used for 
the data assessment (versus beam chord rotation) and that failure was generally defined as 
a 20% drop from the peak.  Also, an opinion was expressed that the data showing extreme 
pinching should be carefully considered and the task group responded that the comment 
would be considered.  However, Roberto Leon commented that gravity carrying capacity of a 
reinforced concrete connection at large drift would be a concern, in contrast to a steel 
connection which degrades very slowly, so that the 20% drop may be questionable and 
should be reexamined.  Bing Li added a comment that column axial load levels need to be 
taken into account, especially for high-strength materials where pinching may become 
significant.  Shyh-Jiann agreed that due to the inefficient bond, high-strength longitudinal and 
transverse reinforcement may not be effective in some beam-column connections though 
high-strength steel is commonly used in Japan, and would account for all the 
aforementioned aspects. 
 
available to support ACI committee work.  These grants are typically in the $10,000 to 
$25,000 range, and committees can apply for these grants by sending a letter proposal to 
the CRC or the SDC.  Chair Hueste informed the committee that proposed research needs 
statements could be submitted to her.  Gustavo mentioned that he had previous experience 
with this support, which worked as leverage to expand to a larger project. 
 
9. Schedule for the Next Committee Meeting 
 The next committee meeting is planned for the ACI Spring Convention in Dallas, TX, 
in mid-March of 2012, at the regular meeting time of Sunday afternoon (March 18th) from 2-
5 pm. 
 
10. Adjournment 
 Chair Hueste informed the committee that any remaining time will be used for task group 
coordination.  The regular meeting was adjourned at 3:50p.
