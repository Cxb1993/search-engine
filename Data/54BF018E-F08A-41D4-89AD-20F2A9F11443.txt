Over the last few decades, the PLL principle 
(Best, 2003; Gardner, 2005) has been proved 
to be very useful in a wide spread of 
engineering applications, such as carrier 
phase tracking, timing recovery, and servo 
control, etc (Hsieh and Huang, 1996). In 
order to cope with the increasingly tough 
performance requirements, high-order PLLs 
are desirable. Yet, the analysis and design of 
high-order PLLs are difficult (Carlosena and 
Manuel-Lazaro, 2007) and insufficient. For 
example, it is required that the loop filter of 
a PLL, in addition to stabilizing the loop, is 
low-pass so as to eliminate the high 
-frequency terms from the detector output. 
The importance of this requirement involves 
validity of the results derived based on 
linear models of the PLLs. However, current 
theory focuses only on lower-order PLLs; 
hence there lacks a useful method for the 
design of higher-order low-pass loop filters 
that guarantee loop stability as well as the 
other performances. On the other hand, 
lock-in range is one of the key parameters 
which govern the dynamic performance of a 
PLL. From the control’s point of view, this 
particular range is closely related to the 
domain-of-attraction of a PLL. It can be 
evaluated through the nonlinear equation

Abstract: Lock-in range is one of the key 
parameters which govern the dynamic 
performance of a phase-locked loop (PLL). 
For low-order PLLs, coarse formulas can be 
derived under certain assumptions and 
approximation for designing loop filters to 
achieve the performance requirement. 
However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
establish such relations for high-order PLLs. 
In this paper, we propose a new loop filter 
design which, in addition to satisfying the 
prescribed lock-in range specification, 
achieves several other performance 
requirements as well, such as small noise 
bandwidth and good transient response 
(small settling time, small overshoot). The 
proposed method is applicable to PLLs of 
any order. 
Lω ω=  where is loop gain (Best, 
2003). For the lower-order loop filters, the 
lock-in range could be derived, based on 
certain assumptions and approximation, in 
terms of the loop gain and the coefficients of 
the filter. However, to the best knowledge of 
the authors, there lacks such results for

filter design, this can be achieved by 
minimizing the

Concerning (v), the lock-in range can be

the intersection of the curve ( )K F jω  and 
the straight line with unit slope. Obviously, 
filter 3F  has the largest lock-in range 3ω  
among the three. This motivates us that, 
intuitively, one may choose a loop filter 
which has large dc gain and large first 
corner frequency for getting a large lock-in 
range.

3. PI FORM LOOP FILTER DESIGN  
In this section, a new method is proposed to 
design PI form loop filter for PLLs. First, we 
utilize the method presented in (Souza and 
Shaked, 1998; Chou et al., 2006) to 
transform the problem of designing a class 
of PI form filters into a static state feedback 
synthesis problem. Next, LMI constraint for 
guaranteed lock-in range is derived. Finally, 
a multi-objective state feedback synthesis 
technique is employed to find a loop filter 
that satisfies the design objectives 
mentioned in Section 2.2.

feedback in the new coordinate, i.e., 
ˆ ( ) sU s F Y= ⋅   
where s sF KF= with 0[ ]s mF f= " f . Thus 
the original PI form filter design problem is 
equivalently transformed to a static state

e 
                             
In this subsection, we incorporate som
other performances into consideration. 
Specifically, the problem is to design a PI 
form loop filter so that the closed-loop is 
stable with good transient response and 
guaranteed lock-in range. In addition, the 
noise bandwidth is as small as possible. In 
an attempt to solve the problem we consider 
to formulate it as the following optimization 
problem:

they almost get locked simultaneously

for PLLs with pa
guaranteed lock-in ra
is no analytic formula for computing the 
lock-in range of high-order PLLs, a 
sufficient condition for finding a filter to 
meet this requirement is derived in terms of 
LMI constraint. In addition to satisfying the 
desired constraint, the proposed method 
considered to trade-off the other objectives 
such as small noise bandwidth and good 
transient response via multi-objective 
control techniques. In comparison with the 
existing results, the proposed method is 
simple and applicable to PLL of any order. 
Simulation results show that the resulting 
PLLs work very well without cycle slips 
when the frequency offset of the reference 
signal is within the lock-in range.
