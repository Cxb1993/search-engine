灰階之小差異，影像品質良好，然價格約在20-30萬美金，多用在醫學上。影像增強管
系統，價格在1萬美金上下，然有球面像差及中央及周圍灰階之差異，影像品質較差，
工業界應用甚多。
研究發現，影像增強管系統之球面像差，乃因影像增強管之球面光電陰極而來，
中央及周圍灰階之差異，一因為X-光源本來就是中央光源較強，二是因為影像增強管
之球面光電陰極使得周圍電子束較不易到達螢光幕。球面像差可以一旋轉及一將直線
投射到雙曲線之線性轉換修正，中央及周圍灰階之差異，可以依圖形離中央原點之距
離加以一加重灰階權數來修正。如此一來，可使低價之影像增強管系統具有較佳之影
像品質，然影像速度會因程式處理變慢。

Abstract—X-ray imaging system has been in medical
and industrial imaging for years. These machines had been
import to domestic market for more than a decade; most of
them are from Japan and US. The strict regulations on
X-ray source and Atomic Energy Commission supervision
lead to great obstacles for the R&D in this area. For the
alignment hole drilling machine, spherical aberration (SA)
is an important issue, for it affects the alignment accuracy.
For the BGA inspection, grey scale is more of a concern,
for it affects the resolution. An X-ray image system is
composed X-ray source and imaging system. In X-ray
source, the smaller the spot size; the better image
resolution. The stronger the current; the brighter the
image. The two are contradictory. Image system can be
divided into: planar image board and Image Intensifier (II)
system. There is no SA in planar image board and the grey
scale between center and circumference is small. The
image quality is very good, but the cost is ~US$200000,
mostly for medical applications. The II system costs
~US$10000, but it has SA and grey scale difference, the
image quality is less than ideal and is used mostly in
industry. This research founds that the course of the SA is
a result of built-in spherical optoelectric cathode, and the
difference in grey scale between center and circumference
come from two sources: one is the stronger X-ray flux at
the center, the other is that electrons from the
circumference of the optoelectric cathode takes a longer
path to reach the phosphor screen. The SA can be
corrected by a linear transformation that project a
straight line onto a convex, and the difference in grey scale
can be corrected by a weighting factor that is increased
proportionaly to the pattern’s distance from the center. 
With these corrections, the image quality of a low priced II
can be improved, but the frame rate will be slowed down
due to processing time.

multiplication structure can be easily incorporated into pixels
of any standard CCD image sensor and included in the image
sensing area, the memory area, or any other vertical or
horizontal CCD register with a minimum area penalty. This
feature thus provides high flexibility in designing new sensors
with various performance characteristics suitable for an
extreme low light level imaging. The paper describes in detail
the theory of charge multiplication and excess noise generation
that is supported by the measured data obtained forms the test
image sensors. The measurement methods that are used to
characterize the charge multiplication gain and noise are also
described in detail.

B. Verdonck et al report that overview images of long parts of
the human anatomy (spine, colon, legs) can be generated from
a translated series of digital image intensifier (II) X-ray images
using dedicated match and paste algorithms. The purpose of
this study is to clarify the relation between the X-ray dose of the
overlapping image series and the resulting image quality
(contrast and noise) and image geometry of the overview image.
We describe the entire acquisition protocol, but focus on the
specific optimizations for translation reconstruction.

Jaroslav Hynecek describes recent progress in technology
of low light level image sensing using CCD sensors that
multiply charge by impact ionization before its conversion into
a voltage. The paper presents a brief description of the concept,
the outline of a typical sensor design with some important
details related to prevention of serial register blooming and
achieving high dynamic range (DR), and then focuses primarily
on the measurement and analysis of noise components that are
important in these devices. The paper describes the theory of
excess noise, shows the computation of the output signal
probability distribution function (PDF), and the derivation of
formula for the excess noise factor (ENF). Finally, it is
concluded that under suitable conditions it is possible to
achieve a single photon (electron) detection (SPD)
performance.
O.P. Ivanov et al report a system based on combined
detector: scintillating plate, image intensifier, and CCD matrix.
The sensitivity of the detector allows the detection of single
photon with energy higher than 60 KeV. The hexagonal URA
masks of ranks 6 and 9 are used for coded mask imaging;
transparent elements of mask are cylindrical holes of diameter
1.3Ð2.2 mm). The imaging possibilities of device are
presented by images of point and circular objects of different
diameters obtained in experiments.

Koichi Nittoha et al report a multi-color scintillator based
high-sensitive, wide dynamic range and long-life X-ray image
intensifier has been developed. A europium activated Y2O2S
scintillator, emitting red, green and blue photons of different
intensities, is utilized as the output fluorescent screen of the
intensifier. By combining this image intensifier with a suitably
tuned high sensitive color CCD camera, it is possible for a
sensitivity of the red color component to become six times
higher than that of the conventional image intensifier.
Simultaneous emission of a moderate green color and a weak
blue color covers different sensitivity regions. This widens the
dynamic range, by nearly two orders of ten. With this image
intensifier, it is possible to image simultaneously complex
objects containing various different X-ray transmissions from
paper, water or plastic to heavy metals. This high sensitivity
intensifier, operated at lower X-ray exposure, causes less
degradation of scintillator materials and less colorization of
output screen glass, and thus helps achieve a longer lifetime.
This color scintillator based image intensifier is being
introduced for X-ray inspection in various fields.

IV. SPHERICAL ABERRATION
Spherical Aberration (SA) is an unavoidable result of II
tube for the photocathode has to be a sphere in order to avoid
photo electron collide and lost through the side wall. Fig. 4-1
show a near perfect image of BGA with a DFP, which show no
SA. Fig. 4-2 show the same BGA viewed with an II tube, a SA
of about 10% is visible.
Fig. 4-1 Image of evenly spaced BGA dots taken with a DFP,
there is no spherical aberration.
Fig. 4-2 Image of the same BGA dots taken with an II tube, the
spherical aberration is obvious.
Fig. 4-3 SA of the II tube.
The image of an II tube is projected on to a large
photocathode, and then reverse and minified on to a small
phosphor plate, therefore, a straight line is projected on to a
hyperbola (fig. 4 - 4-6).

Fig. 5-3 Image of BGA dots taken from top with DFP.
Fig. 5-4 Image of BGA dots taken from angle with DFP.
Grey scale is important when the pattern is composed of
different layers of structures, which would render different
grey scale according to their distance to the screen. Fig. 5-3 to
fig. 5-6 illustrate this effect when stereo image of BGA and
reflow of solders are the objects of observation. In each set of
pictures, the images taken from top and from an angle show
different details. Due to the short depth of focus, DFP
experiences some difficulty in projecting a stereo image.
Lower level structure is not displayed well in angled view.
Fig. 5-5 Image of BGA dots taken from top with DFP showing
the reflow of solders.
Fig. 5-6 Image of BGA dots taken from angle with DFP
showing the reflow of solders.
VI. CONCLUSION
This research founds that the course of the SA is a result of
built-in spherical optoelectric cathode, and the difference in
grey scale between center and circumference come from two
sources: one is the stronger X-ray flux at the center, the other is
that electrons from the circumference of the optoelectric
cathode takes a longer path to reach the phosphor screen. The
SA can be corrected by a linear transformation that project a
