二、計畫英文摘要 
 
Reservoir operation has great impacts on river hydrology, primarily through changes 
in the magnitude, frequency, duration, and timing of the flow regime.  In order to make 
the most profit of the reservoir functions (water supply, power generation, recreation, 
navigation, and flood control), downstream flow release usually uses the minimum flow 
approach to maintain the aquatic ecosystems.  Approximately uniform release reduces 
the variability of the natural flow regime and causes the decline of the ecological integrity.   
 
A novel regime-based approach uses the hydrologic indicators to achieve the 
characteristics of downstream ecological flow regime.  The ecological flow regime 
approach is more focused on reducing the impacts of the existing reservoir by providing 
the necessary amount and variability of water for a river to support its downstream 
ecosystems.  The intermediate disturbance hypothesis is incorporated into the analysis 
using a fuzzy set concept and forms an ecosystem needs objective for the reservoir 
operation.  Because the reservoir has existed for a long period and has its primary 
functions to operate, it is unreasonable to use the pre dam natural flow regime as the target 
flow regime.  In this research, a post dam ecological flow regime with two major 
concerns is proposed for exiting reservoir operation.  First, the ecological flow regime 
considers the characteristics of flow data from nearby locations with less human influence.  
Second, the serial discontinuity concept is applied for modification of the reference flow.  
Then the ecological flow regime can be established for the downstream area of the 
existing reservoir.

few of them are at the small coastal streams.  Twenty-three rivers that collectively cover 
the expanse of the island are included in this analysis.  The drainage areas in which these 
gauges are found range from 11 km2 to 812 km2.  Elevation of the gauging stations 
ranges from near sea level to 1630 m.   
 
Hydrologic indicators have been widely applied in ecological water resources 
management (Richter et al., 2003; Suen and Eheart 2006; Vogel et al., 2007).  Such 
indicators are recognized as being ecologically relevant, and they can be easily calculated 
from historical flow data (e.g. Richter et al., 1996; Poff et al., 1997).  The Indicators of 
Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) approach developed by The Nature Conservancy (Richter et 
al., 1996) is one of the most frequently used methods.  This approach uses daily 
streamflow data to calculate thirty-one hydrologic parameters that are categorized into five 
groups: Group 1 - Magnitude of Monthly Water Conditions; Group 2 - Magnitude and 
Duration of Annual Extreme Water Conditions; Group 3 - Timing of Annual Extreme 
Water Conditions; Group 4 - Frequency and Duration of High and Low Pulses; and Group 
5 - Rate and Frequency of Water Consecutive Daily Means Condition.  These parameters 
adequately represent the majority of the variation of the flow regime for hydroecological 
studies and are easily calculated using a Windows-based computer software developed by 
The Nature Conservancy, USA.  More detailed information on the IHA development is 
found in Richter et al. (1996). 
 
Regionalization 
In most cases, no gauging stations covering pre- and post-dam streamflow data can 
be found downstream of the reservoir in Taiwan.  It is difficult to retrieve the original 
flow regimes which are before the reservoir was built.  The natural flow regime before 
the dam was built is almost assumed unknown.  An alternative way is to use the 
regionalization techniques to capture the hydrologic characteristics of streamflow data 
from similar climatic, physiographic and hydrologic gauging stations for streamflow 
estimation.  The regionalization procedure can be easily found in the literatures (Chiang 
et al., 2002a, b; Sanborn and Bledsoe, 2006).  In this research, annual rainfall, drainage 
area, river length, mean slope, mean elevation, longitude, and latitude of each gauging 
station are used for climatic and physiographic regionalization by cluster analysis.  Any 
location downstream of the reservoir then can be identified to the classified regions by its 
climatic and physiographic characteristics by discriminate techniques.  The designed 
flow regime can be generated by the hydrologic characteristics of the gauging stations 
from the same region. 
 
Ratio Method 
One of the major functions of reservoirs is restoring water for agricultural, industrial 
and public water supply.  The mean annual total streamflow of the post-dam period at a 
downstream location is usually smaller than it of the pre-dam period because of the human 
use.  In the natural condition, the annual total streamflow in an extreme wet year may 
achieve several times of it in an extreme dry year in Taiwan.  After reservoir was built, 
the annual total streamflow at the reservoir downstream location may become only small 
portion of the annual total streamflow in wet years. 
 
In this research, the post-dam annual total streamflow is assumed to be a drought case 
of pre-dam natural condition.  The hydrologic characteristics (magnitude, frequency, 
duration, rate of change) of post-dam condition can be treated as a drought case of

Stations in Group 1 are generally in midstream or downstream areas which have low 
elevation, mild slope, and large drainage areas.  Streamflow in these stations produces 
fewer high and low pulses, longer periods of duration of both high and low pulses, and 
more hydrograph reversals than the other two groups.  The average Julian data of the 
minimum flow in these stations is 35 days earlier than the other two groups.  Stations in 
Group 2 are generally located at higher elevations in the western part of Taiwan.

contrasts to the Minimum instream flow method that is commonly used and can be 
determined by using ‘Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM)’ (Bovee 1982).  
Although the minimum instream flow approach has been applied worldwide, it is 
essentially an anthropocentric approach that concentrates on an approximately flat-line 
minimum flow that is usually based only on a single dominant or target species.  The flow 
regime approach is more focused on reducing the impacts of the reservoirs by providing 
the necessary amount of water for a river to support its downstream ecosystems.  The 
ecological flow regime approach is emerging as a new paradigm for multiobjective water 
resources planning and management because it allows decision makers to get more 
information to find a compromise strategy that satisfies the conflicting objectives of both 
environmental flow needs and human water needs, (Marchetti and Moyle 2001; Suen 2005; 
Suen and Eheart 2006) 
The aim of this paper is to determine the necessary flow regime for existing reservoir 
operation.  Regime based streamflow management approach has only been implemented 
in few reservoir operations.  One of the most critical issues is how to determine the target 
flow regime for management purpose.  Sanborn and Bledsoe (2006) provides a good 
base for predicting flow regime metrics for ungauged locations.  This research will 
demonstrate a framework that incorporate principal component analysis, clustering 
analysis, and multiple regression analysis in an ecological regime estimation model, and 
combine this model with serial discontinuity concept analysis to determine the flow regime 
for existing reservoir operation. 
METHODS 
Due to limited length of this report, Figure 1 only shows the framework of determining the 
flow regime for existing reservoir operation in this research.  The detailed methods in 
each step will include in a full paper. 
 
Climatic and physiographic data then are used for regional clustering analysis and three major regions are 
defined by their climatic and physiographic characteristics.  By comparing the three types of natural flow 
regimes and three climatic and physiographic regions, three ecohydrological regions of Taiwan are classified 
(Figure 2).  Stations in Region 1 are generally in midstream or downstream areas which have low elevation, 
mild slope, and large drainage areas.  Streamflow in these stations contains less high and low pulses, 
longer duration periods in both high and low pulses, and more reversals than the other two regions.  The 
average Julian data of the minimum flow in these stations is 35 days earlier than the other two regions.  
Stations in Region 2 are generally located at higher elevation in west part of Taiwan.  Drainage areas are 
small and slope is steep in these stations.  Streamflow in these stations contains more high and low pulses, 
shorter duration periods in both high and low pulses, and less reversals than the other two regions.  The 
average Julian data of the maximum flow in these stations is earlier than the other two regions.  Stations in 
Region 3 are generally located at costal areas or downstream of smaller river basins.  Annual rainfall in this 
region is the highest region.  The average Julian data of the maximum flow in these stations is 
approximately 15 days later than the other two regions.

Multiple regression analysis is used to derive equations relating each hydrologic indicator to climatic and 
physiographic watershed characteristics within these three ecohydrological regions.  The hydrologic 
indicator then can be estimate by the regression models.   
There are only few gauge stations containing both pre and post dam streamflow records and these records 
are relatively short for IHA analysis.  In order to get a sense of flow regime changes by reservoir operation, 
the results by Magilligan and Nislow (2005) are used here for discussions.  Suen and Eheart (2006) have 
selected 6 hydrologic indicators to describe ecological flow regime for reservoir management.  Table 2 
summarizes the 5 of 6 indicator value changes by types of dams of Magilligan and Nislow’s results.  Annual 
maxima 3-day maxima mean is reduced 38% to 56%,  annual minima 7-day mean is increased 47% to 
180%, and mean duration of low pulses is reduced 15% to 38%.  All this shows that reservoir operation 
generally decreases extreme conditions and causes streamflow varies in a smaller range.  Because of 
water supply purpose, rising rate has been decreased the most (69%) to reserve water in the reservoir for 
future use.  These results present a general sense of the flow regime changes by different types of dams.
