Abstract 
 
In medical content-based image retrieval 
systems, the emphasis is to develop an 
efficient and practical database methodology 
for recognizing and retrieving patterns in 
medical images that represent pathological 
processes. The database is able to store 
relevant image and textual information for 
thousands of cases. The goal is to present the 
viewing physician with a selection of similar 
cases with known diagnoses. In this project, 
we concentrate on mammogram images for 
finding breast calcifications that could be 
classified as benign or malignant. Results of 
image retrieval for mammograms are 
presented in this report. We modified a set of 
126 mammograms and extended to 10000 
images for experiments. The results show 
that an efficacy of 98.30% ～99.36% can be 
achieved. Such results are considered as very 
good performance for any information 
system in terms of recall and precision.

二、緣由與目的 
    Breast cancer is one of the leading 
causes of women mortality in the world, if it 
can be found and treated in the early stage, 
the mortality will be greatly reduced. 
Microcalcifications generally present an 
early sign of breast carcinomas and its 
detection is one of the key issues for breast 
cancer control. Since mammogram is one of 
most reliable methods for early detection of 
breast carcinomas and calcifications, it is 
used frequently by breast examining. 
Because the volume of mammograms 
becomes larger and larger, retrieving similar 
cases for references becomes very time 
consuming. Thus, the goal of this project is 
follows

實驗結果 
In our experiment, we used 126 real 
mammograms and each mammographic ROI 
position and its corresponding type are 
identified by an experienced doctor. Table 4 
summarizes the contents of these 126 images 
in which 60 mammograms have one ROI, 32 
mammograms have two ROIs, 16 
mammograms have three ROIs, and 18 
mammograms have more than four ROIs. 
We utilize these 126 real mammograms to 
enlarge or shrink the size of ROI and change 
the ROI position to produce 10000 new 
mammograms. Then we used these 10000 
mammograms to imitate the situations that 
may happen in the real world.

texture. An optimal feature subset is automatically 
selected using Support Vector Machine and 
Sequential Floating Forward Selection method for 
each decision node of the hierarchical classifier so 
that biopsy images can be classified effectively. 
Experimental results showed that 94.5% of accuracy 
can be achieved for a set of 604 biopsy images with 
another 200 images as the training set. 
 
 
2 Image Acquisitions and Segmentation 
In this study, every image was obtained by the 
same processing and acquisition method. Tissue was 
embedded in paraffin cubes after chemical 
processing and then cut into very thin sections. These 
sections were placed on glass slides and stained with 
colored dyes such as Hematoxylin and Eosin. The 
images were acquired by a set of equipments 
including a high-quality optical microscope, a high 
resolution CCD camera, and an image acquisition 
computer system. Each image was taken through a 
microscope with magnifying factor of 400. There 
were 804 biopsy images with resolution 4080 by 
3072 captured by the above procedure. These images 
were analyzed by an experienced pathologist and 
classified into five grades (0 to 4) in advance for later 
comparison. 
According to the six types of characteristics for 
identifying HCC tumor, the major features used for 
grading are mainly related to cell nuclei; therefore, it 
is essential to segment nuclei from the images 
correctly. A HCC biopsy image may contain many 
undesirable elements such as erythrocyte, leukocyte, 
and impurities as shown in Fig. 1. In our system, we 
used a dual morphological reconstruction method to 
eliminate irrelevances without changing the shapes 
of nuclei in biopsy images. 
Morphological reconstruction [7][8] starts with 
eroding the original image, and then applies a series 
of conditional dilations to the marker image using the 
original image as the conditional image. 
Morphological reconstruction is more effective than 
the conventional opening and closing algorithms for 
removing small blemishes without affecting the 
shapes of interested objects. The process of 
morphological reconstruction for a HCC image is 
shown in Fig. 2, where Fig. 2(a) is the original RGB 
color image, Fig. 2(b) is the grayscale image in the 
red plane, Fig. 2(c) is obtained by eroding Fig. 2(b) 
with a disk shape structure element, Fig. 2(d) is the 
result from morphological reconstruction using 2(b) 
and 2(c) as mask and marker images, respectively. 
Then a second morphological reconstruction 
procedure (a dilation followed by a series of erosions) 
is applied by using Fig. 2(d) as the mask image and 
Fig. 2(e) as the marker image. The final result is 
shown in Fig. 2(f), where the shapes of nuclei are 
well preserved and other irrelative objects are 
removed.  
Thresholding methods [9] are usually used for 
image segmentation. Since the intensities within 
nuclei and in the background are not uniform as 
shown in Fig. 3(a), we utilized watershed transform 
[10] to obtain the edges of nuclei and the snake 
method [11][12] to smooth those edges. The intuitive 
idea of watershed transform is to regard a grayscale 
image as a topographic relief, which is flooded with 
water starting at the surface global minima. The 
water level would increase to fill up lower elevation 
points first. When water coming from different 
basins would meet, dams called watershed ridge lines 
are built. An example of watershed transform for 
nuclei is presented in Fig. 3. Figure 3(b) is the 
gradient image by performing Sobel operator on Fig. 
3(a). The result obtained from watershed 
segmentation is shown in Fig. 3(c). To refine the 
contours of nuclei, a snake method [11][12][13] was 
applied and the final result of segmentation for a 
biopsy image is shown in Fig. 4.

Type-3 (Hyperchromatism): 
  Hyperchromatism represents excessive 
pigmentation in hemoglobin content of erythrocytes. 
It is an important characteristic appearing in a 
malignant tumor. For the case of higher grade HCC, 
chromatin abnormality will increase the staining 
capacity by staining colored dyes especially in cell 
nuclei. By taking the advantage of reflecting the 
amount of chromatin within nuclei, we can obtain the 
following two features: 
y Average intensity (F7): The intensity of nuclei in 
higher grade HCC appears darker than that of 
normal nuclei. Thus, the average intensity reflects 
the degree of dyeing for nuclear staining and can 
be easily extracted from gray-level nuclei. 
y B/D spot ratio (F8): Within a malignant tumor, 
increasing chromatin will cause more holes to 
occur. The holes are reflected by the ratio of 
bright and dark spots in nucleus. The bright and 
dark spots can be found by using top-hat and 
bottom-hat transforms [19], respectively. 
 
Type-4 (Nuclear Size): 
y Area (F9): HCC with higher grade implies a 
higher probability of larger nuclei. Therefore, 
nuclear size is also used as a criterion for HCC 
grading and can be obtained by simply counting 
the number of pixels in nucleus. 
 
Type-5 (Anisonucleosis): 
In cases of HCC with high grades, the variance 
among the areas of nuclei is noticeable. Thus, the 
following two features can be derived from size 
distribution of nuclei for identifying HCC with high 
grades. 
y Standard deviation of nuclear size (F10): This 
feature is calculated by the squared root of the 
average squared deviation from the mean nuclear 
size. 
y Difference of extreme nuclear sizes (F11): 
Sometimes in grade-4 HCC images, there are 
only a few nuclei having large area differences. 
So the standard deviation of nuclear size can not 
represent anisonucleosis effectively. In this case, 
we use the difference between the maximal and 
minimal areas of nuclei as anisonucleosis.

following three features are derived from a GLCM 
Nd with neighboring pixels separated by a distance d

4 Classification 
This study investigated the performance of two 
classifiers. One is to directly use SVM once to 
classify biopsy images into five grades by using all 
fourteen features. The other is to construct a 
hierarchical classifier so that each decision node has 
an optimal feature subset automatically selected by 
Support Vector Machine [23][24] and Sequential 
Floating Forward Selection method [25][26]. 
Support Vector Machine is a popular classification 
and regression technique [23]. The basic idea of 
SVM is to transform data into a higher dimensional 
space and find the optimal hyperplane with maximal 
separation margin between classes. In this study, the 
implementation of SVM used for experiments is 
LIBSVM [24].

in grading G0 and G1. The lowest accuracy is 91.4% 
in grading G3. It seems that our method is more 
“aggressive” as compared to manual grading because 
18 out of 220 images were classified as G4 instead of 
G3. On an average, the overall accuracy is 94.5% for 
classifying 604 biopsy images. In addition, the 
performance of our classifier is better than of a SVM. 
Figure 7 shows the comparison result between a 
SVM classifier and our hierarchical classifier for 
HCC grading with a training set of size 50, 75, 100, 
125, 150 images, respectively. The result shows that 
our hierarchical classifier with optimal subset of 
features in each decision node always has higher 
accuracy than SVM using 14 fixed features.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 Conclusions 
Accurate grading for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) in biopsy images is important to prognosis 
and treatment planning. Visual grading by human 
beings is time-consuming, subjective, and 
inconsistent while computerized HCC analysis for 
biopsy images is a very complex task requiring a lot 
of appropriate image processing steps and experts’ 
domain knowledge for correct justification. In this 
paper, we proposed a novel approach to 
automatically classifying HCC in biopsy images into 
five grades. In image preprocessing, a dual 
morphological reconstruction method was applied to 
remove noise and accentuate nuclear shapes. Nuclei 
were segmented from images using watershed and 
snake techniques. Such a hybrid approach is robust 
in terms of removing noise and preserving shapes of 
nuclei in an effective way. Fourteen features were 
then extracted from segmented biopsy images 
according to six types of characteristics. A 
hierarchical classifier was built to automatically 
classify HCC in biopsy images into five grades so 
that benignancy and various degrees of malignance 
can be distinguished. To make sure the classifier 
should have an effective performance, Sequential 
Floating Forward Selection method was adopted to 
select an optimal feature subset for the Support 
Vector Machine associated with every decision node 
at each stage of classification. Our experimental 
results demonstrated that 94.5% of accuracy can be 
achieved for a set of 604 biopsy images. The results 
also showed that our method has higher accuracy 
than the simple SVM classifier directly using the 
fourteen features.
