一. 中文摘要 
本文討論以風力發電機為對象之分散式電網暫態穩定
度。文獻上鼠籠式感應發電機之臨界清除時間可以分
成兩種，一個是以速度為基準，另一個則是以電壓為
基準。本文針對這兩種不同基準的臨界清除時間進行
討論。我們發現以電壓為基準之臨界清除時間較為嚴
峻，然而這也要同時考慮低電壓穿越能力之規範。

Abstract 
This project compares two types of the critical clearing 
time (CCT) of squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG). 
Induction generators have been widely employed in 
modern renewable power systems. Assessing the stability 
of induction generators embedded power systems we 
usually associate with the CCT. In literature two types of 
CCTs have been frequently quoted for SCIG, one is based 
on its rotor speed and the other is based on terminal 
voltage. In this study we compare these two types of CCTs 
of an SCIG driven by a wind turbine. Scenarios analysis 
has demonstrated that the voltage based CCT is shorter 
than the speed based CCT. However, the meanings of 
these two types of CCTs should be very carefully 
interpreted. 
 
Key Words: squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG), 
transient stability assessment, critical clearing time (CCT)  
 
二. 緣由與目的 
Nowadays induction generators are commonly seen in 
wind power plants. Unlike its synchronous counterpart, a 
squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) doesn’t have its 
own exciter providing magnetic field. Therefore an SCIG 
lacks of the capability of regulating its magnetic field and 
in turn the terminal voltage. This is truly the Achilles’ heel 
of an SCIG. Voltage slumped due to the fault results in 
smaller amount of electrical power output delivered from 
this induction generator. As long as mechanical power fed 
into an SCIG can’t be cut off instantly, imbalance power 
between mechanical and electrical shall accelerate the 
induction generator, consume more reactive power and 
lower further the terminal voltage of the induction 
generator. The vicious circle keeps going and eventually 
the SCIG goes beyond the reach of amendment. Therefore, 
this is not unexpected that the stability analysis and 
control associated with the SCIGs embedded power 
systems has been extensively examined in recent years. 
 
In the power system transient stability analysis, a 
frequently quoted stability index is the critical clearing 
time (CCT). It is defined by the maximum time to clear a 
fault, usually the unlikely but severest three-phase solid 
grounded, in the grid so that the power systems can 
weather the contingency and preserve intact. 
Conventionally when the synchronous generators 
dominate the power systems, synchronism is the main 
theme to present a stable power system operation. CCT is 
usually determined by observing the synchronous machine 
rotor angle deviation with respect to either a pre-specified 
bus or the average of all weighted generator rotor angle. 
However the induction generators are not obligated to the 
power system synchronism. Squirrel cage induction 
generator (SCIG) delivers active power only when it runs 
faster than synchronous speed. Apparently, to assess the 
transient stability of an SCIG, the rotor angle is by no 
means appropriate. 
 
Exquisite transient stability analysis techniques 
developed for synchronous generators in the past several 
decades have paved a way for the induction generator 
stability analysis. The celebrated power-angle curve of a 
synchronous generator along which a critical clearing 
angle (CCA) can be targeted mirrors the torque-slip 
characteristic of an induction machine wherein a critical 
clearing slip or speed (CCS) could be inferred accordingly 
[1][2]. Therefore, CCT of an induction generator can be 
denoted the time beyond which the CCS has been reached 
and afterward the rotor speed would accelerate 
unlimitedly and will not return [3-7]. CCT cited in these 
studies is categorised in the realm of rotor speed stability 
[8], wherein this term is particularly designated for the 
 3 
indicated at point F in Figure 2. The contingency is 
cleared by tripping the circuit breakers at the both ends of 
that faulted transmission line. Bus, lines and machine data 
of the test systems can be found in [13]. 
In this study, the simulation is carried on the platform of 
ACER Aspire 2920 with Intel Core 2 Duo processor 
Centrino CUP. The utilised software is SimPowerSystems 
version 2009a developed by the MathWorks.  
Consider the first scenario. When the fault clearing time is 
0.337 seconds, both the terminal voltage and the rotor 
speed responses are shown in Figure 3. The terminal 
voltage response always exceeds the FERC LVRT 
characteristics and the rotor speed accelerates to 1.03 per 
unit and return to original speed after a period of transient. 
For this fault clearing time neither terminal voltage nor 
rotor speed is out of control. 
 
Figure 3.  Fault cleared at 0.337 seconds 
We next increase the fault clearing time to 0.338 seconds. 
The terminal voltage and rotor speed responses are plotted 
in Figure 4. Notice that the induction generator terminal 
voltage, in spite of securing the LVRT characteristics 
shortly after the fault clearing, yet violates that constraint 
later on. The rotor speed still remains under control after a 
longer period of transients. Consequently the voltage-
based CCT is 0.337 seconds for sure. 
 
Figure 4.  Fault cleared at 0.338 seconds 
As the fault clearing time being 0.339 seconds, the results 
are very alike to that of the case of 0.338 seconds fault 
clearing time: the terminal voltage violates the LVRT 
characteristics but the rotor speed remains under control, 
as illustrated in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5.  Fault cleared at 0.339 seconds 
When the fault clearing time becomes 0.340 seconds, 
SCIG terminal voltage and rotor speed responses are 
depicted in Figure 6. The terminal voltage, of course, still 
violates the LVRT characteristics. But the rotor speed no 
longer returns to reasonable and escapes far away. We 
therefore acknowledge the speed based CCT is 0.339 
seconds. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Fault cleared at 0.340 seconds 
Table I summarises the stable status of SCIG rotor speed 
and terminal voltage under different fault clearing times of 
this scenario. We can observe that the voltage based CCT 
is 0.337 seconds and the speed-based CCT is 0.339. The 
former is 0.002 seconds shorter than the latter.

The statement of voltage based CCT being shorter than 
speed-based CCT comes from last section wherein shows 
the result of just one scenario. For more scenarios, two 
types of CCTs are calculated and summarised in Table II. 
The superscript ‘+’ in scenario 3, 4 and 10 indicates even 
longer CCT than the value tabulated.
