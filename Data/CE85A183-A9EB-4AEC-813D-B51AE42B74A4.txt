Intersection graphs provide theory to underlie much of graph theory. They epitomize
graph-theoretic structure and have their own distinctive concepts and emphasis. They consist
concepts as standard as line graph and as nonstandard as tolerance graphs. They have many
real applications to topics like biology, computing, matrix analysis, and statistics. Many
important graph families can be described as intersection graphs of more restricted types of
set families, for instance sets derived from some kind of geometric configuration. Examples
are interval (unit interval) graphs, circular-arc (unit circular-arc) graphs, chordal graphs,
disk graphs, line graphs, string graphs ... etc.
The focus of this project is to study intersection graph from graph theoretic and algo-
rithmic aspects on the following three directions: intersection numbers, dot product repre-
sentation of graphs, and competition graphs.
Since every graph is an intersection graph, more structures have to be required of the
set representation in order to ask interesting questions about particular graphs. Several
challenging problems arise instantly, including finding smallest set representations and iden-
tifying when a set representation is unique. The study of intersection numbers is closely
related to the clique covering and the clique partition problem.
To generalize intersection numbers of graphs, Fiduccia et al. introduced the following
concept. For a positive integer k, a k-dot product representation of a graph G = (V,E) is
a function f :V → Rk such that two distinct vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if
f(u) · f(v) ≥ 1. The minimum k for which G has a k-dot product representation is called
the dot product dimension of G and is denoted by ρ(G). Fiduccia et al. determined ρ(G)
of some classes of graphs. They also showed that ρ(Kn,n) = n and conjectured that for all
graphs G on n vertices, ρ(G) ≤ n/2. Our aim is to attack this conjecture.
The notion of competition graph was introduced by Cohen in 1968 as a means of
determining the smallest dimension of ecological phase space. In this context, a food web
can be viewed as an acyclic digraphD whose vertices are species with (u, v) ∈ E(D) whenever
species u feeds on species v. The competition graph C(D) is the graph with the same vertex
set as D and two vertices are adjacent if they beat a common vertex. Since then, several
variations have been defined and studied in the literatures. From an algorithmic point of
view, Opsut proved that determining the competition number of a graph is NP-hard. It
has been one of the important research problems in the study of competition graphs to
characterize a graph by its competition number. We study competition numbers of classes
of graphs and its algorithmic aspect in this project.
We finish four papers, one is submitted and the other three are under modification:
(1) Dot product dimensions of graphs,
(2) Strong dot product representations of graphs,
(3) Coloring on competition graphs and competition hypergraph of tournaments,
(4) The competition numbers of Johnson graphs.

A k-dot product graph is a graph with a k-dot product representation. The dot prod-
uct dimension ρ(G) of a graph G is the minimum k for which G is a k-dot product
graph. For convenience, we define ρ(nK1) = 0.
Fiduccia et al. [4] proved that any graph G is a |E(G)|-dot product graph and
so ρ(G) is well defined. In fact, the following theorem implies that ρ(G) ≤ n− 1 for
any graph G of n vertices since ρ(K1) = 0.
Theorem 1 (Fiduccia et al. [4]) If G is a graph, then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G−v)+1 for any
vertex v and ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G− u− v) + 1 for any two vertices u and v with d(u, v) > 2.
They showed that ρ(G) ≤ n/2 for any bipartite graph G on n vertices. They
established that ρ(Km,m) = m, and more generally ρ(Kn1,n2,...,nr) = n2 for n1 ≥ n2 ≥
. . . ≥ nr. They also proved that ρ(G) ≤ 2 for any interval graph, and completely
determined the value of ρ(T ) for a tree T . Among the problems they raised, we are
most interested in the following conjecture.
Conjecture 2 (Fiduccia et al. [4]) If G is a graph on n vertices, then ρ(G) ≤ n/2.
A graph G on n vertices is ρ-good if ρ(G) ≤ n/2. The conjecture by Fiduccia et
al. is then to assert that all graphs are ρ-good. A graph is ρ-critical if it is not ρ-good
but all its proper induced subgraphs are ρ-good. We give several classes of ρ-good
graphs, and necessary conditions for a graph to be ρ-critical. Notice that Fiduccia et
al. have proved that bipartite graphs are ρ-good.
Chordal graphs are ρ-good
A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least four has two adjacent vertices
that are not consecutive in the cycle. The neighborhood N(v) of a vertex v is the set
of all vertices adjacent to v, and the closed neighborhood of v is N [v] = {v} ∪ N(v).
It is well-known [2] that a graph is chordal if and only if every induced subgraph has
a simplicial vertex (a vertex whose close neighborhood is a clique). Notice that if u
is a simplicial vertex, then N [u] ⊆ N [v] for any vertex v ∈ N(u).
A dot product representation of a graph is non-negative (positive, respectively)
if all coordinates of all vectors in the representation are non-negative (positive, re-
spectively).
Lemma 3 If u and v are two distinct vertices in a graph G such that N [u] ⊆ N [v],
then ρ(G) ≤ ρ(G − u − v) + 1. Furthermore, if G − u − v has a nonnegative repre-
sentation, then so does G.
Proof. Suppose ρ(G− u− v) = k and f is a k-dot product representation ofG−u−v.
Choose a positive number ϵ < 1/2 such that f(x)·f(y) < 1−4ϵ2 for every two distinct
2
Notice that the function is well defined, since girth(G) = 5 implies that any vertex
can only be in at most one N(vj) \ {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5}. Then g is a (k+2)-dot product
representation of G. This gives that ρ(G) ≤ k+2 ≤ |V (G)|/2 and so G is ρ-good. 
P4-sparse graphs are ρ-good
Suppose G and H are two graphs with disjoint vertex sets. The union of G and
H is the graph G∪H with vertex set V (G)∪ V (H) and edge set E(G)∪E(H). The
join of G and H is the graph G ∨H obtained from G ∪H by adding all edges xy for
x ∈ V (G) and y ∈ V (H). The complement of G is the graph G with vertex set V (G)
and edge set {uv:u ̸= v in V (G)} \ E(G).
A graph is P4-sparse if every 5-vertex subset contains at most one P4 as an
induced subgraph. Notice that the complement of a P4-sparse graph is P4-sparse,
and every induced subgraph of a P4-sparse graph is P4-sparse. Cographs, which are
graphs with no P4 as an induced subgraph, are P4-sparse.
A spider is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into S,C and R, where
S = {s1, s2, . . . , sk} is an independent set and C = {c1, c2, . . . , ck} is a clique (k ≥ 2)
such that si is adjacent to cj if and only if i = j (for thin spider) or si is adjacent to cj
if and only if i ̸= j (for thick spider), every vertex in R is adjacent to every vertex in
C but none in S. Clearly, the complement of a thin spider is a thick spider, and vice
versa. The triple (S,C,R) is called the spider partition, and can be found in linear
time [5].
Theorem 7 (Jamison and Olariu [6]) If G is a non-trivial P4-sparse graph, then
either G or G is not connected, or G is a spider.
Lemma 8 A graph G has a non-negative k-dot product representation if and only if
it has a positive k-dot product representation.
Proof. We only need to prove the sufficiency of the proposition. Suppose f is a non-
negative k-dot product representation of G. Choose a positive number ϵ such that
f(u) ·f(v)+kϵ2+ϵ(f(u)+f(v)) ·(1, 1, . . . , 1)T < 1 for every two distinct non-adjacent
vertices u and v in G. Define g:V (G) → Rk by g(v) = f(v) + (ϵ, ϵ, . . . , ϵ)T . Then g
is a positive k-dot product representation of G. 
Lemma 9 For a graph G, an integer k ≥ |V (G)| and a positive c, there exists a
positive k-dot product representation f of G such that the maximum of all coordinates
of f(v) is larger than c for any v ∈ V (G).
Proof. Suppose V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. We define a function f :V (G)→ Rk by
fj(vi) =

t, if i = j;
1/t, if i ̸= j and vj ∈ N(vi);
1/t2, otherwise,

Theorem 12 If Gi is a graph of ni vertices such that ni = 1 implying Gj is a complete
graph for 1 ≤ i ̸= j ≤ 2, then G1G2 is ρ-good.
Proof. We shall prove the theorem by induction on n1 + n2. If ni = 1 for some i,
then G1G2 is a complete graph and so is ρ-good. We then may assume that n1 ≥ 2
and n2 ≥ 2.
Suppose some Gi, say G1, has two distinct non-adjacent vertices u and v
such that n1 = 3 implying G2 = Kn2 . Let V (G2) = {x1, x2, . . . , xn2}. Then
d((u, xi), (v, xi+1)) > 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n2, where xn2+1 = x1. By repeatedly applying
Theorem 1 and the induction hypothesis, ρ(G1G2) ≤ ρ((G1 − u − v)G2) + n2 ≤
(n1 − 2)n2/2 + n2 = n1n2/2. Hence, G1G2 is ρ-good.
Now, either n1 = n2 = 3 but G1 ̸= K3 and G2 ̸= K3, or else G1 = Kn1 and
G2 = Kn2 . For the former case or the latter case with G1 = G2 = K2, both G1 and
G2 are bipartite. Then, G1G2 is also bipartite and so is ρ-good. We now consider
the case of G1 = Kn1 and G2 = Kn2 with n1 ≥ n2 ≥ 2 and n1 + n2 ≥ 5. Suppose
V (Kn1Kn2) = {vjj′ : 1 ≤ j ≤ n1, 1 ≤ j′ ≤ n2}. We consider three sub-cases.
For n1 = 3 and n2 = 2, according to Theorems 1 and 3, ρ(K3K2) ≤ ρ((K3K2)−
v11) + 1 ≤ ρ((K3K2)− {v11, v12, v22}) + 2 = 3 and so K3K2 is ρ-good.
For n1 = n2 = 3, we define a function f :V (K3K3) → R4 by f(vjj′) = c
(
ej
ej′
)
,
where ej =
(cos 2jpi
3
sin 2jpi
3
)
and c = (1+cos 2pi
3
)−1/2. Then f is a 4-dot product representation
of K3K3 and so K3K3 is ρ-good.
For n1 ≥ 4 and n2 ≥ 2, we define a function f :V (Kn1Kn2)→ Rn2+2 by
fk(vjj′) =

1, if 1 ≤ k ≤ n2 and k = j′;
0, if 1 ≤ k ≤ n2 and k ̸= j′;
cos jpi
2n1
, if k = n2 + 1;
sin jpi
2n1
, if k = n2 + 2,
where fk(vjj′) is the k-th coordinate of the vector f(vjj′). Then f is an (n2 + 2)-dot
product representation of Kn1Kn2 . As n1 ≥ 4 and n2 ≥ 2, we have n2+2 ≤ n1n2/2
and so Kn1Kn2 is ρ-good. 
The hypercube Qn is K2K2 . . .K2. Or equivalently, V (Qn) = {0, 1}n and
E(Qn) = {(a1, a2, . . . , an)(b1, b2, . . . , bn):
∑n
i=1 |ai − bi| = 1}.
Proposition 13 ρ(Qn) ≤ n.
Proof. First, ρ(Q1) = ρ(K2) = 1 and ρ(Q2) = ρ(K2,2) = 2. For the case of n ≥ 3,
we define a function f :V (Qn)→ Rn by f((a1, a2, . . . , an)) = c(b1, b2, · · · , bn)T , where
bi = 2ai− 1 and c = 1/
√
n− 1. Then f is an n-dot product representation of Qn and
so ρ(Qn) ≤ n. 
We suspect that ρ(Qn) = n. This is clearly true for n ≤ 2, and will be seen for
n = 3 in the following.
6
Proof. (1) follows from the first statement of Theorem 1.
(2) follows from the second statement of Theorem 1.
(3) follows from the fact that bipartite graphs are ρ-good.
(4) follows from Theorem 6.
(5) follows from Lemma 3.
(6) Suppose to the contrary that G is not 2-connected. Choose a cut vertex
u, and suppose G− u has exactly r ≥ 2 components H1, H2, . . . , Hr, each is ρ-good.
Then, |V (Hj)| ≥ 3 for any component Hj. For otherwise, |V (Hj)| ≤ 2 implies
that Hj ∪ {u} has two distinct vertices x and y such that NG[x] ⊆ NG[y], which
is a contradiction to condition (5). Hence, |V (Hi)| ≤ |V (G)| − 4 and so ρ(Hi) ≤
(|V (G) − 4)|/2 for all i. According to Theorems 1 and 10, ρ(G) ≤ ρ(⋃iHi) + 1 ≤
maxi ρ(Hi)+ 2 ≤ |V (G)|/2, which is a contradiction to the fact that G is not ρ-good.
Thus, G is 2-connected. 

when uv ∈ E(G) we have f(u) · f(v) > 1. A graph G is called k-dot product graph if
G has a k-dot product representation of G. In this paper, we present the closely related
notions of strong dot product representations and strict strong dot product representations
of graphs. For a positive integer k, a strong k-dot product representation of a graph G
is a function f : V (G) −→ Rk such that two distinct vertices u and v are adjacent if
and only if f(u) · f(v) > 0. The minimum k for which G has a strong k-dot product
representation is denoted ρ′(G). For convenience, we define ρ′(nK1) = 0. A strong k-dot
product representation f of G is strict if f(u) · f(v) ̸= 0 for any two distinct vertices u and
v. In other words, when uv /∈ E(G) we have f(u) · f(v) < 0. The minimum k for which
G has a strict strong k-dot product representation is denoted ρ′′(G). For convenience, we
define ρ′′(K1) = 0.
The following property establishes relatioins among ρ(G), ρ′(G) and ρ′′(G). Further-
more, it points that dot product representation is a generalization of strong dot product
representation.
Proposition 1 For every graph G, we have ρ(G) ≤ ρ′(G) ≤ ρ′′(G).
Proof. Since every strict strong dot product representation of G is a strong dot product
representation of G, we have ρ′(G) ≤ ρ′′(G). Let f be a strong dot product representation
of G. Choose a sufficiently large constant c such that c2f(u) ·f(v) ≥ 1 for any vertices u and
v with uv ∈ E(G). It is easy to check that cf is a dot product representation of G. Hence,
ρ(G) ≤ ρ′(G). 2
Combining Theorems 7 and 9, it is easy to check that ρ(3P3) = 2, ρ
′(3P3) = 3 and
ρ′′(3P3) ≥ 5. Therefore, there are examples such that the equality in Proposition 1 may not
hold.
2 Bounds for ρ′(G) and ρ′′(G)
Given a graph G = (V,E). the neighborhood of a vertex v, written N(v), is the set of all
vertices adjacent to v; and the closed neighborhood of v is N [v] = {v} ∪N(v). The degree
of v, written d(v), is the number of neighbors of v. A vertex v is called an isolated vertex
if it has degree 0. The cardinality |V (G)| of V (G) is called the order of G. A subgraph
of G is a graph H such that V (H) ⊆ V (G) and E(H) ⊆ E(G). A subgraph H of G is an
induced subgraph of G if two vertices of H are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent in
G. When S ⊆ V (G), the subgraph induced by S, written G[S], is the induced subgraph
of G with vertex set S. The graph G − S is the subgraph of G induced by V (G) − S. If
S = {v}, we denote G− S by G− v.
In this section, we present bounds on ρ′(G) and ρ′′(G).
Proposition 2 If H is an induced subgraph of a graph G, then ρ′(H) ≤ ρ′(G) and ρ′′(H) ≤
ρ′′(G).
Proof. If f is a strong dot product representation of G, then f restricted on V (H) is
also a strong dot product representation of H. Thus, ρ′(H) ≤ ρ′(G). Similarly, we have
ρ′′(H) ≤ ρ′′(G). 2

Lemma 6 If v1, v2, · · · , v2n+1 are nonzero vectors in Rn, then vi · vj > 0 for some i ̸= j.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction on n. It is easy to verify that the statement
is true for n = 1. When n ≥ 2, let vi,j be the j-th coordinate of vi for all i. By changing
the coordinate system, we may assume that v1,n > 0 and v1,j = 0 for all j < n. Thus,
vi,n ≤ 0 for all i > 1, for otherwise we are done. Let v′i = (vi,1, vi,2, · · · , vi,n−1)T in Rn−1
for i = 2, 3, · · · , 2n + 1. By the induction hypothesis, if {v′i : i = 2, 3, · · · , 2n + 1} has at
least 2(n − 1) + 1 nonzero vectors in Rn−1, then v′i · v′j > 0 for some i ̸= j and vi · vj =
v′i · v′j + vi,nvj,n > 0. Otherwise, v′s and v′t are both zero vectors for some s ̸= t. Since vi is a
nonzero vector for all i, so vs,n < 0 and vt,n < 0, and therefore vs · vt = vs,nvt,n > 0. 2
Remark. Let S = {±ei : i = 1, 2, · · · , n}, where ei is the i-th standard unit vector in Rn.
Then the set S has 2n nonzero vectors of Rn satisfying that x · y ≤ 0 for all x ̸= y in S.
Therefore, the number 2n+ 1 in Lemma 6 is sharp.
Let G be a graph without isolated vertices. According to Lemma 6, we have that the
size of an independence set of G is at most 2ρ′(G), so we immediately obtain the following
result.
Theorem 7 If G is a graph without isolated vertices, then ρ′(G) ≥ α(G)
2
.
We give an alternative proof for Lemma 8.
Lemma 8 (Fiduccia et al. [3]) If v1, v2, · · · , vn+2 are vectors in Rn, then vi ·vj ≥ 0 for some
i ̸= j.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction on n. It is easy to verify that the statement
is true for n = 1. When n ≥ 2, let vi,j be the j-th coordinate of vi for all i. If v1 is the
zero vector, then v1 · v2 = 0. Hence, we may assume v1 is a nonzero vector. By changing
the coordinate system, we may assume that v1,n > 0 and v1,j = 0 for all j < n. Thus,
vi,n < 0 for all i > 1, for otherwise we are done. Let v
′
i = (vi,1, vi,2, · · · , vi,n−1)T in Rn−1 for
i = 2, 3, · · · , n + 2. By the induction hypothesis, we have v′i · v′j ≥ 0 for some i ̸= j and
therefore vi · vj = v′i · v′j + vi,nvj,n ≥ 0. 2
According to Lemma 8, we have that the size of an independence set of a graph G is
at most ρ′′(G) + 1, so we have the following result.
Theorem 9 For any graph G, we have ρ′′(G) ≥ α(G)− 1.
Remark. Combining Corollary 5 and Theorem 9, ρ′′(nK1) = n − 1 = α(nK1) − 1 and as
Theorem 9 is in fact sharp. Therefore, we have that the number n + 2 in Lemma 8 is also
sharp.

i = 1, 2. Let N = 〈PW (y1), PW (y2)〉. Then N is a subspace ofW . Since PW (y1) ·PW (y2) ≤ 0
and xi · PW (yj) > 0 for all i, j, we have PN(xi) · PN(xj) > 0 for all i, j. Therefore, we have
(xi − PN(xi)) · (xj − PN(xj)) = xi · xj − PN(xi) · PN(xj) < 0 ∀ i ̸= j.
Then dim(W ∩N⊥) ≥ m−1 is a contradiction to the fact that N is a subspace of dimension
two of W with dim(W ) = m. Consequently, we have PW (yi) ·PW (yj) > 0 for all i, j. Finally,
we have
(yi − PW (yi)) · (yj − PW (yj)) = yi · yj − PW (yi) · PW (yj) < 0 ∀ i ̸= j.
By Lemma 8, dim(W⊥) ≥ n− 1. Hence, ρ′(Km,n) = m+ n− 1. 2
Theorem 12 Suppose r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1. If n3 ≤ 2, then ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) =
n1+n2−1. Otherwise, we have ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) ≤
∑s
i=1 ni−2s+3, where s = max{i : ni ≥ 3}.
Proof. Since Kn1,n2,···,nr contains Kn1,n2 as an induced subgraph, by Proposition 2 and
Theorem 10, we have ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) ≥ ρ′′(Kn1,n2) = n1+n2−1. We claim that ρ′′(K2,2,···,2) ≤
3. Let V (K2,2,···,2) = {vi,j : 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ r} and E(K2,2,···,2) = {vi,jvs,t : j ̸= t}.
Choose a suitable constant φ satisfying the conditions that cos2 φ cos (r−1)pi
r
+ sin2 φ > 0 and
cos2 φ cospi + sin2 φ < 0. Now, we define a function f : V (K2,2,···,2) −→ R3 by
f(vi,j) =

 , if i = 2.
It is easy to check that f is a strict strong 3-dot product representation of K2,2,···,2, thus
ρ′′(K2,2,···,2) ≤ 3. For the case when n3 ≤ 2, then Kn1,n2,···,nr is an induced subgraph
of Kn1,n2,2,···,2. According to Theorem 4 and ρ
′′(K2,2,···,2) ≤ 3, we have ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) ≤
ρ′′(Kn1,n2,2···,2) ≤ ρ′′(K2,2,···,2)+(n1−2)+(n2−2) ≤ n1+n2−1. Therefore, ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) =
n1 + n2 − 1. For the case when n3 ≥ 3, assume s = max{i : ni ≥ 3}. According to Theo-
rem 4 and ρ′′(K2,2,···,2) ≤ 3, we have ρ′′(Kn1,n2,···,nr) ≤ ρ′′(K2,2,···,2,ns+1,···,nr) +
∑s
i=1(ni − 2) ≤∑s
i=1 ni − 2s+ 3. 2
4 Extreme graphs
Combining Proposition 1 and Corollary 5, we conclude that ρ′(G) ≤ ρ′′(G) ≤ n − 1 for all
graph G of order n. This section gives a necessary and sufficiently condition for graph G
with ρ′(G) = n− 1 or ρ′′(G) = n− 1.

Corollary 16 Let n be an integer with n ≥ 3. Then ⌈n−1
4
⌉ ≤ ρ′(Cn) ≤ 2⌈n+46 ⌉.
It remains open to decide the exact value of ρ′(Pn) and ρ′(Cn).
6 Concluding remarks
Let G be a graph of order n. By Corollary 14, we have that ρ′(G) = n − 1 if and only
if G is {K3, K2 ∪ K1}-free. Thus, we completely characterize a graph G of order n with
ρ′(G) = n − 1. It is easy to check that ρ′′(G) ≥ 2 for all graph G of order 4, except
ρ′′(2K2) = ρ′′(K3 ∪K1) = ρ′′(K4) = 1. Therefore, we give a necessary condition for ρ′′(G) =
n− 2 as follows.
Theorem 17 Let G be a graph of order n. If ρ′′(G) = n− 2 then G is {2K2, K3 ∪K1, K4}-
free.
Note that the above condition is not sufficient. For example, ρ′′(C4) = ρ′′(K2,2) = 3
but C4 is {2K2, K3 ∪K1, K4}-free. Therefore, it remains open to completely characterize a
graph G of order n with ρ′′(G) = n− 2.

Figure 1: A 7-tournament T with C(T ) = K7 and the circulant tournament H7.
A hypergraph H is a pair (V, ε), where V is the vertex set of H and ε is a family of
subsets of V , called hyperedges. A k-coloring of a hypergraph H is a labeling f from V (H)
into {1, 2, · · · , k}. The labels are colors; the vertices of one color form a color class. For
each hyperedge e of H, it is called monochromatic if the vertices of e label same color. A
weak k-coloring of H is a k-coloring such that it has no monochromatic hyperedge. The
weak chromatic number χw(H) is the least k such that H has a weak k-coloring. A k-
coloring of a graph G is proper if f(u) ̸= f(v) for any two adjacent vertices u and v. The
chromatic number of G, written χ(G), is the least k such that G has a proper k-coloring.
Given a digraph D, the competition graph of D, denoted C(D), is the graph with the
same vertex set V (D) and for any distinct x and y in V (D), xy ∈ E(C(D)) if and only if
N+(x)
⋂
N+(y) ̸= φ. The competition hypergraph of D, denoted CH(D), is the hypergraph
with the same vertex set V (D) and e ∈ V (D) is a hyperedge of CH(D) if and only if |e| ≥ 2
and there is a vertex v ∈ V (D) such that e = N−(v). In 1995, Lundgren et al. [9], show
that χ(C(Hn)) = ⌈n2 ⌉ and gave two questions. First question is that whether if T is an n-
tournament, then ⌈n
2
⌉ ≤ χ(C(T )). Second question is that for all integers ⌈n
2
⌉ ≤ k ≤ n− 1,
does there exist an n-tournament T with χ(C(T )) = k? This paper proves that the answer
of Lundgren’s questions are true. In addition, we study coloring on competition hypergraphs
of tournaments.
2 Competition graphs of tournaments
Let [k]n denote “k modulo n”. The circulant tournament of order n, denoted Hn, is an
n-tournament with vertex set V (Hn) = {v0, v1, v2, · · · , vn−1}, for each vertex vi with 0 ≤ i ≤
n − 1, the arc (vi, v[i+t]n) ∈ E(Hn) for all 1 ≤ t ≤ n−12 , when n is even, it increases the arc
(vj, v[j+n
2
]n) for
n
2
≤ j ≤ n− 1.
Theorem 1 (Lundgren et al. [9]) If Hn is the circulant tournament of order n, where n ≥ 4,
then χ(C(Hn)) = ⌈n2 ⌉.
Lemma 2 Let n be an integer with n ≥ 7. Then there exists an n-tournament T such that
C(T ) = Kn.
2
3 Competition hypergraphs of tournaments
In this section, we give an upper bound for χw(CH(T )) and a necessary condition for a
tournament T with χw(CH(T )) = 2.
Lemma 6 The competition hypergraph CH(T ) of an n-tournament T has at most five hy-
peredges of order two. Moreover, if CH(T ) has exactly five hyperedges of order two, then
they must be the cycle of order 5.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that there exists a tournament T such that CH(T ) has at
least six hyperedges of order two. Assume d−(vi) = 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Since T is a tournament,
we have that N−(vj) contains at least three vertices in {v1, v2, · · · , v6} for some j, which is
a contradiction as |N−(vj)| = 2. Moreover, if CH(T ) has five hyperedges of order two, say
N−(vi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ 5, then T [S] must be the regular 5-tournament where S = {v1, v2, · · · , v5},
see Figure 2. It is easy to check that CH(T [S]) = C5. 2

Figure 2: T1 is the regular 4-tournament; T2 is the regular 5-tournament.
Theorem 7 If T is an n-tournament, then χw(CH(T )) ≤ ⌈n2 ⌉.
Proof. If CH(T ) has no hyperedge of order two. Let f be a ⌈n
2
⌉-coloring of CH(T )
with each color class contains at most two vertices. Clearly, f is a weak ⌈n
2
⌉-coloring.
Suppose that T has t hyperedges of order two with t ≥ 1, denoted by {ei : 1 ≤ i ≤ t}.
Consider a graph G with V (G) =
⋃
1≤i≤t V (ei) and E(G) = {ei : 1 ≤ i ≤ t}. First,
we claim that G is triangle-free. Suppose to the contrary that there are three vertices
{u1, u2, u3} of in-degree two such that their in-neighborhoods {N−(u1), N−(u2), N−(u3)}
form is a triangle. If N−(ui) contains other two vertices for some i, then N−(uj)∩N−(ui) = ∅
for some j ̸= i, which is a contradiction to the fact that {N−(u1), N−(u2), N−(u3)} form
is a triangle. Otherwise, each N−(ui) contains exactly one in-neighborhoods in {u1, u2, u3}.
So {u1, u2, u3} is a proper subset of ⋃1≤i≤3N−(ui), which is a contradiction to the fact that
{N−(u1), N−(u2), N−(u3)} form is a triangle. Thus, G is triangle-free. By Lemma 6, we
have that |E(G)| ≤ 5 and equality for G = C5. Consequently, G contains at most one odd
cycle and if G has an odd cycle then this cycle is the C5. So it is not hard to verify that
G has a proper ⌈n
2
⌉-coloring which each color class contains at most two vertices except

algorithmic point of view, Opsut [14] proved that determining the competition number of a
graph is NP-hard problem.
The edge clique cover of a graph G is a family of cliques such that each edge of G is
covered by some cliques in the family. The edge clique cover number θe(G) of a graph G is
the minimum size of an edge clique cover of G. Opsut [14] gave a lower bound of κ(G) in
terms of θe(G) and |V (G)|.
Theorem 1 ([14]) For any graph G, then κ(G) ≥ θe(G)− |V (G)|+ 2.
A vertex ordering v1, v2, · · · , vn of a digraph D is called an acyclic ordering if (vi, vj) ∈
A(D) implies i < j. It is well known that a digraph D is acyclic if and only if D has an
acyclic ordering. Dutton and Brigham [4] characterized the competition graphs of acyclic
digraphs in terms of edge clique covers as follows.
Theorem 2 ([4]) A graph G is the competition graph of an acyclic digraph if and only if
there exists a vertex ordering v1, v2, · · · , vn of G and an edge clique cover {S1, S2, · · · , Sn} of
G such that vi ∈ Sj implies i < j.
A vertex clique cover of a graph G is a family of cliques such that each vertex of G
is covered by some cliques in the family. The minimum size of a vertex clique cover of G is
called the vertex clique cover number, and is denoted by θv(G). Opsut [14] gave a lower
bound of κ(G) in the following.
Theorem 3 ([14]) Let G be a graph. Then κ(G) ≥ min{θv(Gu) : u ∈ V (G)}, where Gu is
the subgraph induced by N(u).
Given a vertex subset S of a graph G, denote E(S) = {e : e in E(G) is incident to v
for some v ∈ S}. When S = {v1, v2, · · · , vk}, denote E(S) byE(v1, v2, · · · , vk). An edge clique
cover of E(S) is a family of cliques of a graph G such that each edge in E(S) is covered by
some cliques in the family. The minimum size of an edge clique cover of E(S) is denoted by
θ(E(S)). Obviously, θ(E(u)) = θv(Gu) for all u ∈ V (G).
Proposition 4 Let S1 and S2 be two vertex subsets of a graph G. If G has no edge between
S1 and S1, then θ(E(S)) = θ(E(S1)) + θ(E(S2)), where S = S1 ∪ S2.
Proof. It is easy to see that θ(E(S)) ≤ θ(E(S1))+ θ(E(S2)). Since G has no edges between
S1 and S2, we have that if a clique Q covers some edges of E(S1) then Q does not cover any
edges of E(S2). Therefore, θ(E(S)) = θ(E(S1)) + θ(E(S2)). 2
Recently, Sano, Li and Chang [11, 17] generalize the results of Theorems 2 and 3 as
follows.
Lemma 5 ([13]) If {Q1, Q2, . . . , Qr} is an edge clique cover of a graph G with n vertices
and t is an integer such that | ∪j≤i Qj| ≤ i+ t− 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, then κ(G) ≤ r − n+ t.
Theorem 6 ([13, 17]) If G is a graph of order n ≥ r ≥ 1, then
κ(G) ≥ min{θ(E(S)): S ⊆ V (G) with |S| = r} − r + 1.
2
case, we may assume that Xi = [d + 1] − {i} for 1 ≤ i ≤ r − 1. If Xr contains an element
t with t ≥ d + 2, then |Xr ∩ [d + 1]| ≤ d − 1. Thus, |Xr ∩ [d + 1]| = d − 1 and each Xi
must contain Xr ∩ [d+ 1] for 1 ≤ i ≤ r− 1, a contradiction to | ∩ri=1 Xi| < d− 1. Therefore,
| ∪ri=1 Xi| = d+ 1 and | ∩ri=1 Xi| = d− r + 1. 2
Lemma 9 shows that for each clique Q in J(n, d) then either V (Q) ⊆ SY for some
Y ∈
(
[n]
d−1
)
or V (Q) ⊆ TW for some W ∈
(
[n]
d+1
)
.
Lemma 10 For n ≥ 2d ≥ 4, if a vertex v is adjacent to ui in J(n, d) for i = 1, 2, · · · , t with
t ≤ d, then there exist at least d− t pairwise nonadjacent vertices in N(v)− ∪1≤i≤tN(ui).
Proof. Assume that Xu = {1, 2, · · · , d}. For each ui, then Xui ∩Xu = [d]−{ki} for some ki.
Thus, | ∪1≤i≤t Xui| ≤ d+ t. Moreover, when t < d, we may assume that ∪1≤i≤tXui ⊆ [d+ t]
and ki ≤ t for i = 1, 2, · · · , t. Let Xj = (Xv − {t+ j}) ∪ {d+ t+ j} for 1 ≤ j ≤ d− t. Then
{vX1 , vX2 , · · · , vXd−t} as desired. 2
Lemma 11 For n ≥ 2d ≥ 4, let v1, v2, · · · , vt be distinct vertices in J(n, d) with t ≤ d. Then
θ(E(v1, v2, · · · , vt)) ≥ td− t(t−1)2 . Moreover, the equality holds only if {v1, v2, · · · , vt} forms a
clique in J(n, d).
Proof. Assume that N(vt) ∩ {v1, v2, · · · , vt−1} = {v1, v2, · · · , vr} for some r ≤ t − 1.
By Lemma 10, there exist d − r pairwise nonadjacent vertices v1, v2, · · · , vd−r in N(v) −
∪1≤i≤rN(vi). Clearly,
θ(E(v1, v2, · · · , vt)) ≥ θ(E(v1, v2, · · · , vt−1)) + d− r ≥ θ(E(v1, v2, · · · , vt−1)) + d− t+ 1.
Therefore, θ(E(v1, v2, · · · , vt)) ≥ ∑1≤i≤t(d− i+1) = td− t(t−1)2 . Moreover, the equality holds
only if {v1, v2, · · · , vt} forms a clique in J(n, d). 2
By Theorem 6 and Lemma 11, we immediately obtain a theorem in the following.
Theorem 12 For n ≥ 2d ≥ 4, then κ(J(n, d)) ≥ d2−d+2
2
.
3 An upper bound for the competition number of J(n, d)
For n > k, Kim et al. [8] define an order ≺ on the set
(
[n]
k
)
as follows. LetX1 = {i1, i2, · · · , ik}
and X2 = {j1, j2, · · · , jk} with i1 < i2 < · · · < ik and j1 < j2 < · · · < jk. Then they define
X1 ≺ X2 if there exists t < k such that is = js for s ≤ t and it+1 < jt+1. It is easy to see
that ≺ is a total order.
We order the vertex set of J(n, d) and Fnd such that V (J(n, d)) = {vX1 , vX2 , · · · , vX(nd)}
and Fnd = {SY1 , SY2 , · · · , SY( nd−1)} where Xi+1 ≺ Xi and Yj+1 ≺ Yj for all i, j. Now, we
construct a bipartite graph BJ(n,d) with V (BJ(n,d)) = X ∪ Y where X = {X1, X2, · · · , X(nd)}
and Y = {Y1, Y2, · · · , Y( nd−1)}; Xi and Yj are adjacent if X ≺ Xi for all X ∈
(
[n]
d
)
with Yj ⊆ X.
Note that N(X1) ⊇ N(X2) ⊇ · · · ⊇ N(X(nd)) and if Xi is adjacent to Yj then Xi is adjacent
to Yl for l ≥ j in BJ(n,d).
