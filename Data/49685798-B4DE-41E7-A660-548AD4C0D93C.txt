Since the PCF was firstly realized by J.C. Knight in 1996[1], it is used for a wide range of 
applications and is attracting numerous researchers involvement. The PCF is also called a holey fiber 
or a microstructure fiber, which structure is different from the traditional standard single-mode fiber 
(SMF). The light guiding along the axial direction of this fiber can make total reflection by 
fabricating thin air-holes in the cladding region. As the publication [2~4], the structure of PCF 
different from traditional SMF exists a lot of important characteristics, for example: broad 
single-mode spectral ranges, unique dispersion characteristics, reduced nonlinearity, low bending 
loss fabricating by one material, etc.  
The fiber-grating is one of important fiber-passive components for developing recently in fiber 
optics. In 1978 K.O. Hill [5] utilized the photo-sensitive fiber to fabricate the first fiber grating by an 
argon laser. Because a fiber grating has the characteristics of narrow-bandwidth optical filters, it can 
look as fiber mirrors. As the fiber grating manufacturing technology has been developed to be 
semi-automatic process and has good repeat efficiency, now it has become a commercial product. It 
has a wide range of applications, example as filter devices in communication, fiber laser reflectors, 
and fiber sensors which are composed of temperature, stress, refraction index sensors.  
The fiber grating can be divided into two kinds by period. One is fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) in 
which the period is short about micro-meter range. The other is long period gratings (LPG) which 
period is the range from several tens to hundreds of micro-meters. Due to the different optical 
characteristics for the two gratings, their applications are different. At moment, fiber gratings are 
potential passive components for fiber sensors and optical communications.  
The long period gratings (LPG) is proposed by Ashish M.Vengsarkar in 1995 at first [6], which 
period is extra-longer than the guided-light wavelength and is larger than that of fiber Bragg gratings. 
A fiber grating can couple the fundamental core mode into to the cladding modes to cause several 
deep loss-notches in transmission spectrum. The relationship between the wavelength of specific 
deep notches and grating periods can be obtained as

)( clco nnn −=∆ ; nco is the core index of the fiber and ncl is the cladding index. is the period of a 
long period grating. A long period fiber grating based on the loss performance in transmission can be 
used in an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) of optical communications and fiber sensors, 
including band rejection filter, comb filters, mode converters and temperature-, stress-, refraction 
index-, and camber sensors etc. In general the fabrication of a long-period fiber grating is utilizing an 
amplitude mask and the photosensitive fiber by the exposure of an ultraviolet (UV) laser. Another 
fabricating method of an LPG is point-by-point writing technique which is based on a translation 
stage to shift the appropriate focused-laser beam with the grating period per step. C. Others LPG’s 
fabricating techniques have (1) to utilize high-frequency acoustic waves to vibrate the fiber to cause 
a tunable LPG; (2) by using an electric arc combining with the technique of point-by-point heating

point-by-point heating process. For the measurement of the characteristics of the LPG in PCF,

the splicing between the PCF and the standard fiber (Corning SMF-28™ fiber) requires firstly to be 
accomplished. Due to the air-holes physical structure in PCF, the spark created by a splicer will little 
bit break the air-holes structure if the spark current is not set to be a suitable level. At present, the 
splicing loss of 2dB has been obtained in our experiments as shown in figure 2. In this figure curve A 
is the transmission spectrum of a white light guided along the PCF of 1 meter long and curve B is the 
transmission spectrum when the white light goes through a spilcing point and then through a piece of 
standard fiber from the PCF. Figure 3 shows the physical splicing-point side-view for the left side of 
SMF-28 single-mode fiber and the right side of the PCF. In the splicing process a 5-g standard 
weight is used to pull the PCF over a fiber holder to provide constant tension.

Then one end of this section of the PCF is connected to the white source, which offers the 
flat-spectrum light source extended from visible region to the infrared light. The other end is 
connected to optical spectrum analyzer (OSA). Fig.4 shows the experimental set-up of the fabrication 
of the LPG with 14 periods is located at 1422nm and with a deep notch of -18dB. The effective 
index change for the mode coupling equals to  at the wavelength of 1422nm. The 
total length of LPG is 5.85mm. For the second LPG, discharging power and spark time are adjusted 
to be 100 bit and 100ms respectively. The period of gratings is still 450µm. The total length is 23.4 
mm with 53 periods. The resonance wavelength of LPG with 53 periods is located at 1536.2nm and 
a deep notch of -11dB, which effective index change
