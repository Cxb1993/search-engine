Abstract
A novel bismaleimide of 2,2-bis[4-(4-maleimidophenoxy)phenyl]propane (BMIP) with a broad working-temperature-
range for the melt blending was successfully synthesized. BMIP possesses a considerably broad working-temperature-range
from 75 C to 250 C, prior to undergoing cure reactions to form a highly crosslinked network. The morphology types of
cured BMIP/clay hybrids can be controlled by varying the shearing temperatures and the contents of the clay. The con-
ditions necessary for achieving an exfoliated or an intercalated BMIP/clay hybrid were thoroughly investigated via X-ray
diﬀractometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All the uncured sam-
ples prepared at diﬀerent shearing temperatures and with an adequate amount of MMT-C (above 3 phr) exhibited an inter-
calated form of morphology. However, the crosslinking reactions for speciﬁed samples prepared at relatively elevated
shearing temperatures (above 120 C) and with a relatively low content of clay (below 15 phr) resulted in morphology
changes from the intercalated form to the exfoliated form of morphology. There exists an isotropically mechanical prop-
erty for the cured matrix of the exfoliated hybrids whereas there exists an anisotropically mechanical property for the cured
matrix of the intercalated hybrids.

1. Introduction
An intercalation is one of the most eﬀective
approaches to prepare polymer/clay hybrids,
including solution intercalation, melt intercalation
and intercalation polymerization [1]. The most prac-
tical and promising technique is the melt intercala-
tion of the polymer into the interlayer gallery
region of the clay, because melt intercalation can
avoid problems associated with the search of appro-
priate solvents and their recovery in the solution
intercalation and intercalation polymerization.
Although the melt intercalation was already
applied in many thermoplastic polymers, most poly-
imides, including condensation types (linear poly-
mers) and addition types (network polymers), were

2.2. Instrumentation
(1) Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC): Sam-
ples approximately 3–6 mg in weight were sealed in
hermetic pans and scanned in a diﬀerential scanning
calorimeter (Perkin-Elmer DSC-7) calibrated with
an indium standard. A stream of nitrogen at a ﬂow
rate of 20 mL/min was used to purge the DSC cell.
(2) Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were
recorded on a Digi-Lab FTS-40 FTIR spectrometer.
The samples were mixed with dried KBr powder and
pressed into pellets. Spectra were obtained in an opti-
cal range of 400–4000 cm1 by averaging 32 scans at
a resolution of 8 cm1. (3) Themolecular structure of
the synthesized bismaleimide monomer was charac-
terized by the chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spec-
trum (Varian UNITY INOVA-500) using CDCl3
as a solvent and TMS (tetramethylsilane) as the
internal standard. (4) Constituents of the synthesized
bismaleimidemonomer were analyzed by an Elemen-
tal Analyzer (EA) (Elementar Vario EL 111, Ger-
many). (5) The morphology of the fracture surfaces
of the hybrid was observed with a JEOL 5610 scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM). (6) Wide-angle
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) spectra of the polyimide
nanocomposites were recorded using a Rigaku,
Dmmax-B diﬀractometer (Japan) with Ni ﬁltered
CuKa radiation (k = 1.5406 A˚) at a scanning rate
of 1 C/min over the range 2–10 2h, and an accelerat-
ing voltage of 40 kV and a 30 mA current. (7) Trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed
with a JEOL JEM-2100F instrument using an accel-
erating voltage of 100 kV on ultra-thin samples (typ-
ically 60 nm) microtomed from polyimide
nanocomposites, using an Ultracut-E Reichert Jung
ultramicrotome. (8) Samples approximately 5–10 mg
in weight were placed in platinum pans and scanned
in a thermogravimetry analysizer (TGA) (TA Instru-
ment TGA 2960) at a heating rate of 20 C/min. A
stream of nitrogen at a ﬂow rate of 110 ml min1
was used to purge the TGA chamber. (9) Storage
moduli (E 0) were determined through measurement
of Perkin-Elmer dynamic mechanical analyzer
(DMA-7) equipped with a thermal mechanical ana-
lyzer (TMA). Temperature was calibrated with an
indium standard. Temp/time scanmode in tree-point
bending method was used. The frequency, ampli-
tude, and tension were set 1 Hz, 8.5 lm, and 100%,
respectively. A stream of nitrogen at a ﬂow rate of
30 mL/min was used to purge the DMA cell. The
change of storage moduli (E 0) were measured over
the temperature range of 40–350 C at a heating rate
of 10 C/min, thickness ca. 30 lm were used for
measurement.
2.3. Synthesis of 2,2-bis[4-(4-maleimidophenoxy)-
phenyl]propane (BMIP)
Takeda et al. [17] reported on the preparation of
various bismaleimides containing ether bonds.
A few simple modiﬁcations were made in this
work to synthesize 2,2-bis[4-(4-maleimidophenoxy)
phenyl]propane (BMIP). A 1000-mL three-neck
reactor was charged with 1.10 mol maleic anhydride
(MA) and 200 mL DMF solvent, with the anhydride

cess. By contrast, the DSC trace for the pristine
BMIP illustrates that BMIP possesses a consider-
ably broad working-temperature-range from 75 C
(endothermic peak, melting temperature) to
250 C, prior to undergoing cure reactions. Cure
reactions proceed from 250 C to 380 C (exother-
mic peak). When compared to BMI, the pristine
BMIP shows a relatively low melting temperature
(Tm) and a small endothermic enthalpy, which can
probably be attributed to the eﬀect of the ether link-
age on the packing of molecules.
The DSC scan for BMIP shows an exothermic
peak from 250 C to 380 C (shown in Fig. 3), indi-
cating cure reactions occur, and complete cure is
achieved after 380 C. These cure reactions can be
illuminated by the corresponding FTIR spectrum.

spectra of BMIP monomer prior to being cured
and the cured BMIP, respectively. The characteristic

and TEM images. Although SEM and TEM images
usually show the local morphology, these observa-
tions can still provide further clues to elucidate the
X-ray diﬀraction patterns. For brevity, only 3 phr
content of MMT-C was discussed in the following
section.
3.1.1. Morphology before curing
Shown in Fig. 5 are the X-ray diﬀraction patterns
of various BMIP/MMT-C matrices prior to being
cured. Curve (a) is the pattern of pristine MMT-C
for comparison, suggesting a basal spacing of
1.98 nm. Curve (b) is the pattern of uncured BMIP
for comparison, indicating an obscured and broad-
ened peak in the vicinity of 2h = 4.8 which is related
to the polymer nature. Curves (c) to (g) are the pat-
terns of various BMIP/MMT-C matrices relating to
the shearing temperatures of 105, 120, 140, 160 and
180 C at the speciﬁed amount of 3 phr of MMT-C,
and assigned as B-C3-105, B-C3-120, B-C3-140, B-
C3-160 and B-C3-180, respectively. Usually, a
higher shearing temperature facilitates the diﬀusion
of more BMIP molecules into the clay gallery. Nev-
ertheless, all of these matrices showed the same
basal spacing of 3.97 nm, suggesting that the melt
BMIP molecules indeed diﬀused into the gallery
region of MMT-C by the shear force at the elevated
temperature and that the basal spacing is relevant to
the molecular structure rather than the amount of
BMIP molecules diﬀusing into the gallery region
of MMT-C. The X-ray diﬀraction patterns illus-
trated that before being cured all the samples exhib-
ited the intercalated morphology. The resulting
intercalated morphologies were further evidenced
by a representative TEM image (uncured sample
of B-C3-105), as shown in Fig. 6. The intercalated
phase in Fig. 6 demonstrates a basal spacing of
4 nm, which compares well with the observation of
the X-ray diﬀraction patterns.
3.1.2. Morphology after curing
The curing behaviors of the samples correspond-
ing to the previously stated ones were investigated
by their FTIR spectra. For brevity, the FTIR spec-
tra are not shown here. The results of the FTIR
spectra of the BMIP/MMT-C hybrids suggested
the same curing behavior as that of the pristine
BMIP, regardless of the presence of MMT-C. Hom-
opolymerization of maleimide groups to form a
highly crosslinked networks is the exclusive reaction
without any chemical interactions between the poly-
mers and the clays.
The X-ray diﬀraction patterns for the cured sam-
ples with diﬀerent shearing temperatures are shown
in Fig. 7. The characteristic peak (3.97 nm) for all
the samples except for B-C3-105 disappeared after
curing, distinctly attributable to the crosslinking
reaction of a considerable amount of BMIP mole-
cules in the clay gallery, thereby breaking down
the clay layers, and eventually resulting in an
exfoliated morphology. As previously stated, a
higher shearing temperature facilitates the diﬀusion

Fig. 9a shows an intercalated morphology for the
lower shearing temperature of 140 C (B-C10-140),
while Fig. 9b shows an exfoliated morphology for
the higher shearing temperature of 160 C (B-C10-
160).
The morphologies of the fracture surfaces for the
intercalated hybrid and exfoliated hybrid were also
examined by the SEM observation (for brevity,
not shown here). In the exfoliated morphology,
the clay nanolayers must be uniformly dispersed in
the polymer matrix, thereby exhibiting a rough or
ﬁbrillar surface when fractured. On the contrary,
for the intercalated morphology, the clay layers
were aggregated as tactoids or simply intercalated,
displaying a slippery or brittle surface when
fractured.
3.2. Eﬀect of clay content on the morphology of the
BMIP/MMT-C matrix
As previously investigated, in the case of 3 phr
content of clay, an exfoliated form of cured hybrid
was formed at a shearing temperature above
120 C. Ordinarily, the viscosity is much reduced
in the melted hybrids at a higher shearing tempera-
ture. Therefore, the samples prepared at shearing
temperatures of 120, 140, 160 and 180 C were cho-
sen to further explore the eﬀects of the clay content
on the morphology of the BMIP/MMT-C matrices.
For brevity, only the cases of 120 C were discussed
in the following section. The weighed BMIP was
melted and sheared homogenously with the desig-
nated amounts of MMT-C (3, 5, 10 or 15 phr),
respectively, at shearing temperatures of 120 C.
3.2.1. Morphology before curing
The X-ray diﬀraction experiments of various
BMIP/MMT-C matrices with diﬀerent levels of
MMT-C content prior to being cured were con-
ducted. For brevity, X-ray diﬀraction patterns are
not shown here. All of these matrices (3, 5, 10 and
15 phr content of MMT-C) showed the same basal

the lower clay content (5 phr) resulted in the clay
nanolayers being uniformly dispersed in the poly-
mer matrix, and exhibiting an exfoliated rather than
intercalated morphology, as shown in Fig. 12b.
The morphologies for various shearing tempera-
tures (105, 120, 140, 160 or 180 C) associated with
diﬀerent levels of MMT-C (3, 5, 10 or 15 phr) were
thoroughly investigated and summarized in Table 1.
The borderline for the cured samples in Table 1
make a clear distinction between intercalated and
exfoliated morphology. On the whole, all the
uncured samples prepared at any shearing tempera-
tures and with an adequate amount of MMT-C
(above 3 phr) possessed an intercalated morphol-
ogy. However, the crosslinking reactions for the
speciﬁed samples prepared at relatively elevated
shearing temperatures and with relatively low con-
tent of clay resulted in the morphology changes
from the intercalated to the exfoliated form. Alter-
natively, the lower left corner (higher shearing tem-
perature and lower clay content) illustrates the
exfoliated morphology, whereas the upper right cor-
ner (lower shearing temperature and higher clay
content) elucidate the intercalated morphology.
3.3. Physical properties of the BMIP/MMT-C
matrix
Physical properties including the thermal degra-
dation temperatures and the storage moduli were
thoroughly investigated by means of TGA and
DMA. All of these measurements are previously
described in Section 2.2. For brevity, TGA and
DMA traces are not shown here, but all of the mea-
sured values are summarized in Table 2. The ther-
mal degradation temperatures Td5% and Td50% are
deﬁned as the temperatures at 5% or 50% weight
loss, respectively, by the TGA analyses. Modulus
values listed in Table 2 are the values of DMA mea-
surements at 50 C.
From the observations of thermal degradation
temperatures, Td5% values for the cured BMIP/
MMT-C hybrids were always higher than that for
the pristine BMIP, whereas Td50% values for the
cured BMIP/MMT-C hybrids were always lower
than that for the pristine BMIP, irrespective of the
shearing temperatures, clay contents and morphol-
ogy (intercalated or exfoliated form). It illustrates
that the cured BMIP/MMT-C hybrids can bear a
higher temperature for thermal degradation. It also
showed that the Td5% values of the exfoliated form
were higher than those of intercalated form for the
samples with the same clay contents. Once degrada-
tion occurs, those cured hybrids have a higher degra-
dation rate, resulting in a lower value of Td50%. In
addition, the cured hybrid with 3 phr clay content
achieve a maximum of Td5% values, then Td5% values
decrease with the increase of clay content. Whereas,
Td50% values for the cured hybrids increase with the
increase of clay content, reach a maximum value for
the hybrid with 10 phr, and then decrease again.
On the other hand, the storage modulus values
for the cured BMIP/MMT-C hybrids were always
higher than that for the pristine BMIP. Interest-
ingly, diﬀerent morphology types exhibit somewhat
