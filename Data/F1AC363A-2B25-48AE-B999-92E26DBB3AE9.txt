一、 中文摘要
高速加工是一種可以大幅提升生產力以及減少
生產成本的技術, 然而, 在端銑削的作業中, 生
產力常常會受到 chatter 的限制而無法進一步
提升。 因此, 隨著主軸轉速的提高, 利用 stabil-
ity lobe 來提高材料移除率的可能性也愈來愈
高, 而選用最佳的主軸速度成了高速加工中一個
非常重要的考量因素。
本研究將發展一個高速端銑削的切削動態模型。
首先, 將先建立端銑削切削程序模型; 接下來,
於先前計畫中所發展的包含高速效應之有限元
素整合模型將被應用於高速端銑削的 chatter
分析中; 最後將探討主軸系統的設計參數對於
lobe diagram 的影響。 此結果可被用於高速工
具機的設計中, 以提升 chatter 預測的精確度。

Abstract
High speed machining (HSM) is a promising
technology for drastically increasing produc-
tivity and reducing production costs. How-
ever, the productivity is often limited by
chatter rather than by other process con-
straints when machining with end mills.
Therefore, as spindle speeds have increased,
the possibility of using the stability lobe
charts to significantly increase the metal re-
moval rate has become more attractive, and
decision of optimum spindle speeds has be-
come an important concern.
In this research, a dynamic model for high-
speed end milling considering high-speed ef-
fects will be presented. First, the milling pro-
cess model will be build. Next, the verified
integrated finite element model of the spindle
system with high-speed effects will be mod-
ified to be applied in the chatter analysis of
high-speed end mill. Finally, the effects of de-
sign parameters of the spindle system on lobe
diagrams will be investigated. The results
can be used in the design of high-speed ma-
chine tools to enhance the accuracy of chatter
prediction.

二、 緣由與目的
到目前為止, HSM 仍為現代製造科技中一
個相當新的領域。 雖然德國人 Salomon 早在
1931 年即提出金屬材料高速切削的理論 [1], 但
第一台高速加工工具機要一直到 1980年左右才
真正問市 [2, 3], 近年來, 各大先進工具機製造
商更是紛紛投入高速工具機的研發,此領域的發
展也因而日新月異。 其中工具機製造商 Mazak
即展望在不久的未來,高速加工中心將可達到主
軸(spindle) 最高旋轉速度 100,000 rpm、 加速
三、 高速端銑削動態模型
主軸系統動態特性模型
本研究的馬達內建式主軸系統的動態特性模
型, 在不考慮不平衡質量的作用之下可寫為:
([MT ] + [MR]){q¨}+ ([D]− Ω[MG]){q˙}
+ ([K]− Ω2([MT ]− [MR])){q} = {f(t)}
(1)
以及
[K] = [KS] + [KB] (2)
其中 {q} 為主軸系統各節點在旋轉座標中的位
移; Ω 為主軸的旋轉速度; [MT ] 為移動質量矩
陣; [MR]為旋轉質量矩陣; [D]為阻尼矩陣; [K]
為主軸系統的剛性矩陣; [G] 為主軸系統的 gy-
roscopic 矩陣; {f(t)} 為外加負荷向量; [KS]
與 [KB] 為主軸以及徑向軸承剛性矩陣; 詳細的
推導和驗證請參考 [18]。
端銑削切削力模型
在端銑削切削程序中, 若端銑刀上共有 m個
切刃, 且假設旋轉軸 x 與第一切刃重合, 令第一
切刃於切削初始接觸點的角度為 0, 則第 i 個切
刃的角度為:
φi =
2ipi
m
(3)
切刃在切削的過程中會產生切線以及法線方
向的切削力, 其中切削力於切線方向的分力 ft
與切屑的截面成正比, 亦即:
ft = ctb∆x (4)
其中 ct 為比力; b 為軸向切削深度;∆x 為切屑
的截面。於法線方向的切削力與切線方向的切削
力成比例, 若此比例為 cr, 則法線方向的切削力
fr 可表示為:
fr = crctb∆x (5)
因此,任一切削中的切刃所產生的切削力在 x方
向的投影可寫為:
fx,i = −frcosφi − ftsinφi (6)
將所有切刃於 x 方向的切削分力加總, 則此合
力為:
fx = −fr(
m∑
i=1
uicosφi)− ft(
m∑
i=1
uisinφi) (7)
其中 ui 表示此切刃是否處於切削狀態中, 若於
某時刻,第 i個切刃處於切削狀態中,則 ui = 1,
否則 ui = 0。
將式(4)與 (5)代入式 (7)中,並考慮最保守
的情形, 亦即切削過程中切削力最大的情況, 則
式 (7) 可化簡為:
fx = −ctcdb∆x (8)
其中
cd = max{cd′} (9)
且
cd′ =
m∑
i=1
ui(crcosφi + sinφi) (10)
端銑削動態穩定模型
端銑削的典型閉迴路自引發程序如圖 (1) 所
示, 其中振動 X(s) 導致了切削力的變動, 而切
削力的變動亦會導致振動, Gx(s) 為工具機系統
的 transfer function, 其定義為振動振幅與切削
力變動幅度的比值, Hx(s) 為端銑削程序模型,
其將切削力表示為切屑厚度的函數,如式 (4) 所
示。 請注意所有的平均值都沒有包含在內, 因為
在估算系統的 stability 與這些平均值無關。 接
下來, 考慮 chatter 發生的情形, 若發生 chat-
ter 時, 兩連續切刃通過工件表面的時間差為:
τ =
2pi
Ωm
(11)
此時於 x 軸方向產生的振動力可表示為:
fx = −ctcdb(x(t)− x(t− τ)) (12)
在 frequency domain 中, 上式可轉換為:
Fx(s) = −ctcdb(1− e−sτ )X(s) (13)
因此, 由 Hx(s) = Fx(s)/X(s) 的定義
Hx(s) = −ctcdb(1− e−sτ ) (14)

Abstract—With increasing demands for higher productivity
and lower production costs, high-speed machine tools have been
widely utilized in the modern production facilities. Meanwhile,
to meet the requirements of higher spindle speeds and more
versatile machining capabilities, it is becoming necessary for
engineers to thoroughly realize how the spindle system design
would inﬂuence the system dynamics with considering high-

can enhance the performances of automatic high-speed machine
tools such as spindle speeds, metal removal rates, and machining
quality. In this paper, I ﬁrst develop a design ﬂow chart to
represent the overall spindle design problems. Based on this
ﬂow chart, eight design parameters are identiﬁed. A design
sensitivity analysis of these eight design parameters is then
conducted based on an integrated ﬁnite element method model
to investigate their inﬂuence on the natural frequencies of the
spindle system. The results show that the most important design
parameters to the system dynamics include spacing between the
front and rear bearing sets, spacing between middle line of the
two bearing set and the free end of cutter, and length of the
spindle shaft.

I. INTRODUCTION
With increasing demands for higher productivity and lower
production costs, high-speed machine tools have been widely
utilized in the modern production facilities. Meanwhile, to
meet the requirements of higher spindle speeds and more
versatile machining capabilities, it is becoming necessary
for engineers to thoroughly realize how the spindle system
design would inﬂuence the system dynamics with considering
high-speed effects. With this understanding, machine tool
designers can enhance the performances of automatic high-
speed machine tools such as spindle speeds, metal removal
rates, and machining quality.
Although theories of high-speed metal cutting were re-
ported in the 1930s [1], machine tools capable of achieving
these cutting speeds did not exist commercially until the
1980s. This late acceptance was mostly due to the perfor-
mance and reliability problems caused by complicated high-
speed effects, such as chatter and premature spindle bearing
failures [2]. Therefore, to realize the advantages of high-
speed machining, it is of advantage to consider these high
speed effects in the design stage.
The main design requirement of machine tools is con-
cerned with achieving desired surface ﬁnish and machining
accuracy of the part without sacriﬁcing machine’s reliability
and integrity. Important design factors include weight, cutting
forces, forced vibrations, self-excited vibrations, and thermal
expansions [3]. The problems caused by forced and self-
excited vibrations during operating are more difﬁcult to
predict, particularly at high speeds. The forced vibration is
primarily due to the unbalanced mass of the rotating spindle,
while the self-excited vibration is induced by the cutting
process [4, 5]. These two processes are all highly related to
the dynamic characteristics of machine tool spindle systems.
Regarding the spindle system design, Al-Shareef and
Brandon [6] constructed a simpliﬁed multi-stepped spindle-
bearing system model to investigate the effects of design
parameters to the static stiffness in the cutting zone for short
overhang spindles. Their results showed that the most effec-
tive parameter was the bearing spacing. In another paper, they
used inﬂuence coefﬁcient method to investigate the effects of
design parameters on the dynamic performance of spindle-
bearing systems [7] and the results showed that the front
bearing stiffness only slightly inﬂuenced the lower modes.
Kang et al. [8] analyzed the effects of design parameters on
static and dynamic performance of spindle-bearing systems
by using Finite Element Method (FEM). The parameters
considered in their case studies included journal diameter
and span ratio, and bearing stiffness for static performance,
but for dynamic performance, only the bering stiffness was
considered. The only high speed effect included in their
FEM was gyroscopic moments. Li and Shin [9] published
a paper to investigate the effects of bearing conﬁguration on
the dynamics of high speed spindles. With the constraints of
satisfying chatter vibration free, Maeda et al. [10] proposed
a bearing spacing optimization strategy for the spindles
conﬁgured with an expert system.
The dynamics mechanism of high-speed motorized spin-
dles is highly complicated. An integrated FEM model has
been developed by Lin et al. [11] to combine the changes

Fig. 3. Elements of the spindle system
where ca is an empirical data decided by the experimental
results; Pa,i and Pa,t are the initial and thermally induced
preload in the axial direction, respectively.
The total deformation of the bearing in the direction of line
of contact Δ0 can be expressed as the following equation
Δ0 = Δ1 + Δ2 cos θ −Δ3 sin θ (7)
where Δ1 is the axial thermal expansion difference, which
is mostly caused by the shaft and the spacer; Δ2 is the
thermal expansion difference of the inner ring and outer ring
in the radial direction; and Δ3 is the expansion of the rolling
elements.
Then, the thermally induced preload can be obtained as
Pa,t = ktΔ
1.5
0
(8)
where kt is an equivalent spring constant, which is obtained
empirically. Eqs. (7) and (8) are then used to determine
Pa,t and subsequently the bearing stiffness subject to thermal
preload which can be determined.
As shown in Fig. 3, the spindle shaft is represented by
a 23-element ﬁnite element model in this paper. A program
is written using MATLAB to convert the above system data
into a set of equations of motion. Detailed derivation and
validation of these equations can be found in [11].
III. THE DESIGN SENSITIVITIES OF DPS ON THE
NATURAL FREQUENCIES
The inﬂuences of DPs on the system natural frequencies,
mainly the ﬁrst mode (NF1) and second mode (NF2) fre-
quencies, are explored in this section. The DPs, introduced
in Fig. 1, are further depicted in Fig. 3 and their deﬁnitions
can be found in Table I. These DPs can be separated into
three categories, for which DP1 belongs to the initial preload
category, DP2, DP3, DP4, and DP5 belong to the bearing
location category, while DP6, DP7, and DP8 belong to
the spindle speciﬁcation category. The following results are
derived by changing all the design parameters one at a time
while the other parameters remain unchanged. The focused
DP is varied from 90 percents to 110 percents of its initial
values and the system natural frequencies are obtained by
using the integrated FEM model for rotating speeds from 0
rpm to 25,000 rpm, with a 5,000 rpm increment. To facilitate
demonstration and analysis, only the results of forward modes
are provided.

Fig. 4. The effects of the bearing initial preload (DP1) on spindle system
natural frequencies
A. Initial Preload Design Parameter
For the spindle system of Fig. 2, the front bearing set of
the target spindle system is preloaded with ﬂexible devices,
while the rear bearing set is preloaded rigidly. Therefore,
only the rear bearing preload is treated as a design parameter
and is denoted as DP1. The front bearing preload becomes
a operating parameter because it can be adjusted during
operation. Fig. 4 shows the effects of DP1 on the system
natural frequencies. As expected, by increasing the rear
bering preload, both NF1 and NF2 increase at all speeds.
Note that the stiffness of the spindle system softens at higher
speeds as discussed in [11]. Fig. 4 indicates that by increasing
the rear bearing preload, the NF1 and NF2 can be recovered
to some extent but are still lower than the values at 0
rpm. Note that rear bearing preload can not be increased
indeﬁnitely because it can cause thermal instability [15, 16].
B. Bearing Location Design Parameters
It is assumed that the center lines of the front bearing set,
the rear bearing set, and the front and rear bearing sets remain
unchanged during variation processes of DP2, DP3, and DP4
respectively; therefore, the right-hand side and left-hand side

Fig. 10. The effects of diameter of spindle shaft (DP7) on spindle system
natural frequencies
in Fig. 9. From the ﬁgures it can be seen that the natural
frequencies increase with DP6. Therefore, high strength
materials are preferred.
DP7 represents the sizes of spindle shaft in diameters.
The effects of DP7 are shown in Fig. 10. From these two
ﬁgures, we can discover NF2 possesses local maxima around
ratio 0.98 of the original value of DP7. This nonlinear
phenomenon results mainly from the fact that the system’s
mass and stiffness matrices contributed from the spindle
shaft, ([MT ] + [MR]) and [KS ] shown in (1) and (2),
increase simultaneously with increases of DP7, while the
stiffness from bearings, [KB], remains constant. Therefore,
upon determining spindle shaft diameters, the inﬂuences of
bearing stiffness must be taken into account.
DP8 means the total length of the spindle shaft in Fig. 3.
The effects of DP8 on the natural frequencies are presented in
Fig. 11. From the ﬁgures, we can see that the system natural

Fig. 12. The radar charts for the ﬁrst mode natural frequency
frequencies decrease with increases of DP8, which conﬁrms
that longer shafts result in lower natural frequencies. Note
that the overhang ratio of the spindle system remains constant
during the variations of DP8.
IV. ANALYSIS OF THE DPS’ EFFECTS
In the following discussion, the maximum and minimum
values of ﬁrst mode and second mode natural frequencies
and their corresponding ratios of DPs are identiﬁed from the
ﬁgures in Section III for all eight DPs with respect to 0 rpm
and 25,000 rpm. Dividing the ratios of NF1 and NF2 by the
corresponding ratios of DPs and taking their absolute values,
we can obtain an index similar to elasticity measurements.
The consequent indices are demonstrated with radar charts to
facilitate relative importance comparison of the DPs. Fig. 12
and Fig. 13 show the results for the ﬁrst and second modes
respectively. From these two ﬁgures, it can be discovered that
the corresponding ratios exceed 1 include DP4 (@ ratio 1.1)
and DP8 (@ ratio 0.9 and 1.1) on both modes ,and DP5 (@
ratio 0.9 and 1.1) only on second mode.
From the above analysis, we can ﬁnd that if the system
natural frequencies NF1 and NF2 are determined as the
design targets, the important design parameters are spacing
