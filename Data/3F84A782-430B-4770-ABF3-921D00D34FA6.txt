Abstract 
 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a potentially life-threatening skin reaction.  
Drugs are the major causes for cases of SJS. While treating patients with SJS, the first 
and most important step is to identify and discontinue any possible responsible drugs. 
However, potential drugs that may lead to SJS are many and encompass various 
medical fields. Very few physicians are familiar with the potential risk of all these 
drugs. If properly treated, most SJS cases are expected to recover without much 
sequelae. All drugs that have been associated with SJS should be avoided in these 
patients to prevent recurrence. If the physicians fail to identify and discontinue the 
drugs causing SJS, or even adding new drugs related to SJS, the patient may get worse 
or SJS may recur. These conditions can cause SJS patients to be re-hospitalized 
. 
Currently the reasons for re-hospitalization of SJS patients in Taiwan are not known. 
This study uses Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to analyze the 
causes of re-hospitalization for cases of SJS. First, we classified prescription history of 
re-hospitalized patients through the rule-based classification method. Secondly, by 
using the basic properties of prescription behaviors, we identified drug association 
patterns. Then, by employing A-priori algorithm, pairs of drugs were generated and 
their degrees of association were obtained by using selected objective measures. 
Finally, by listing and ranking up these pairs of drugs based on their degrees of 
association, we provide prescribing physicians with possible means of increasing the 
awareness and reducing re-hospitalization of SJS patients.

There have been a growing number of applications of data mining in healthcare. [10]. The 
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database contains all the prescription information 
for outpatients and hospitalized patients in Taiwan. In this study, we investigated re-hospitalized 
SJS cases in a year of National Health Insurance Database. The classification of prescription 
behaviors of physicians treating hospitalized SJS patients leading to re-hospitalization may help 
physicians to understand the causes associated with of SJS re-hospitalization.  
 
Methodology 
 
1.1 Data Pre-processing using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Databases 
in the year of 2004.   
 In this study, data pre-processing is used to obtain prescription records for patients who were 
re-hospitalized because of SJS, and to encode identified drugs.  
 
1.2 Classifying prescription behavior.  
 This study uses rule-based classification [11] to classify prescription records for patients who 
were re-hospitalized for SJS treatment. This property describes the prescription behaviors that 
were performed by physician before each hospitalization of SJS patients.  
 The following is the definition of patient’s prescription behavior classification properties that 
will be used as main terms onwards. 
Definitions.  
Table f_XY stands for prescription behavior properties where: 
F: the drug. 
X: whether patient used specialized drugs before first hospitalization, if yes fill ‘1’, otherwise fill 
‘0’. 
Y: whether patient used specialized drugs after first hospitalization, if yes fill ‘1’, otherwise fill 
‘0’. 
By definition 1, this study has three basic properties of prescription behavior: 
1. f_11: using drug f before and after first hospitalization (continuing use of drug f). 
2. f_10: using drug f before first hospitalization, and stopping using it afterward (discontinuing 
use of drug f). 
3. f_01: not using drug f before first hospitalization, but using it after first hospitalization 
(newly added drug f). 
1.3 Generating drugs pair candidates.  
Based on these basic properties, prescription behaviors that were commonly performed by 
physicians in treating SJS patients can be classified into six categories: (1) Physicians 
immediately identified that SJS was caused by a certain drug and therefore discontinued it, but 
after hospitalization they added new drugs that can also lead to SJS ({f_10, f_01}). (2) 
 6 
The next step is to identify actual drugs used under these behavior associations. This study 
adopts A-priori algorithm to generate frequent drug sets which potentially cause SJS patients to 
be re-hospitalized. Their degrees of association were then measured. 
 
1.4 Calculating degrees of association between drugs.  
After generating drug pairs, the degree of association for each pair was calculated. In this 
study we selected six objective measures. Four of those are asymmetric objective measures 
(Mutual Information, Gini Index, Certainty Factor, and Added Value), and the other two are 
symmetric objective measures. (Cosine and Jaccard).   
 
Table 2 below lists six selected objective interestingness measures for association rules taken 
from [14] where A and B represent the antecedent and consequent of a rule respectively. 
 denotes the probability of A;  denotes the conditional probability 
of B, given A.

this study. We may see from this table that O1 property represents the first property that already 
mentioned before, while O3’ represents the second one and O4 represents the third one.

Table 9 illustrates the ranking results of drug pairs under {f_10}  {f_01} behaviors using 
six objective measures. It shows that ranking results yielded by two groups of objective measures 
are relatively different in determining the rank. Most of asymmetric objective measure 
determines DP6 (T3_10 and M6_01) as drug pairs that have the highest rank while symmetric 
objective measures determine them as 7th or 8th rank. It is because asymmetric measures found an 
interesting pattern between T3_10 and M6_01 that is drug T3 is always discontinued when drug 
M6 is newly added (known as M6_01 Æ T3_10 association rule). Certainty Factor Measure (F) 
proved this statement by giving the highest degree of association value for M6_01 Æ T3_10 rule. 
Meanwhile, all objective measure equally determines DP14 as drugs pair that has the least 
significant association. However, when applying these measures to the other two categories of 
drug association behaviors, it appears that asymmetric and symmetric measures produce relative 
similar ranking results. 
By computing the sums of the rank values from the six objective measures, we can derive 
composite rank for all pairs of drugs. The order of the magnitudes of the sums will indicate an 
ordering of the drug pairs, with the lowest sum corresponding to the most significant association 
of drugs pair, as presented in Table 9.

In this study, using an objective measure approach, we have found three associations that are 
linked to re-hospitalization of SJS patients. These associations represent common prescription 
behaviors of physicians that might cause re-hospitalization of SJS patients.  
 
In the first association (Table 10), discontinuation of one drug used before the first 
hospitalization, together with the presence of a newly added drug after the first hospitalization 
tends to cause the second hospitalization. This implies that the prescribing physicians were aware 
of the possibility of certain drugs {f_10} causing SJS leading to the first hospitalization, so 
discontinued them. However, they did not notice that other drugs {f_01} could also cause SJS, so 
they added those new drugs for certain clinical conditions. These new drugs in turn elicited SJS 
in these susceptible patients, and lead to the second hospitalization.  
 
In the second association (Table 11), continuing use of a drug used before the first 
hospitalization, together with the presence of discontinuation of another drug after first 
hospitalization, tends to cause the second hospitalization. This implies that the prescribing 
physicians were aware of the possibility of certain drug {f_10} causing SJS leading to the first 
hospitalization, so discontinued them. However, they were not aware that some other drugs the 
patients were also using {f_11} at the same time could also be responsible for SJS, and failed to 
discontinue them also. 
 
In the third association (Table 12), continuing use of a drug used before the first 
hospitalization, together with the presence of a newly added drug after the first hospitalization, 
tends to cause the second hospitalization. In this association, prescribing physicians not only 
failed to recognize the responsible drugs for SJS {f_11}, but also added other drugs that could 
also cause SJS {f_01}.  
 
Among the drugs that are continued {f_11} or added {f_01} after the first hospitalization, 
and are thought to be associated with re-hospitalization, the highest association falls on 
Cephalosporin-class antibiotics <U>, followed by dicofenac <T3>, then clonazepam <O1> and 
penicillins-class antibiotics <G>. We think this is due to the fact that these highly associated 
drugs are widely used in Taiwan. Cephalosporin-class antibiotics and penicillins-class antibiotics 
exist in all forms (parenteral, oral, external, etc.) and are frequently prescribed. Diclofenac is a 
popular Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Clonazepam is widely used for muscle relaxation 
and sedation. Prescribing physician may not be aware of the potential risk of these drugs in 
causing SJS in susceptible individuals, so as to continue or even adding these drugs in SJS 
patients, hence leading to re-hospitalization. None of the traditional anticonvulsants such as 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, or valproic acid have such an association {f_11}, while newer 
anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and topiramate have {f_01}. This can be attributed to the fact 
that traditional anticonvulsants are already notorious for their association with SJS, so most
