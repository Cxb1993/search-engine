Abstract 
In this 3-year NSC project, we have 
accomplished a number of new results 
regarding the torsional rigidity of cylindrical 
shafts containing fibers or coated fibers with 
perfect bonding or imperfect bonding 
interfaces. First, we have constructed the 
variational principles for general types of 
interfaces models, and establish rigorous 
bounds on the torsional rigidity of composite 
shafts with imperfect interfaces. Second, we 
derive upper and lower bounds for the 
torsional rigidity of host shafts containing a 
number of cylindrical fibers, in which both 
the transverse cross-sections of the host shaft 
and the fibers could be arbitrary in shape. In 
particular, we propose a method to construct 
statically and kinematically admissible fields 
interior to the matrix and to the fibers. Third, 
we consider the boundary value problem of 
torsion for a circular shaft containing a 
number of fibers or coated fibers which 
could be arbitrarily dispersed or periodically 
positioned inside the host shaft. The 
formulation is based on a complex variable 
method together with simple mapping 
techniques, representing the warping fields in 
Laurent or Taylor series based on different 
origin points. Fourth, we propose a novel 
class of graded cylinders as neutral 
inclusions inside host shafts of arbitrary 
cross-section under Saint-Venant's torsion. 
The graded cylinder is made of cylindrically 
orthotropic materials with position varying 
quantities. The profiles of the two distinct 
shear moduli in the radial and tangential 
directions follow specific patterns based on 
an arbitrarily selected function along the 
radial distance. We show that this type of 
graded cylinders can serve as universal 
neutral inclusions interior to host shafts of 
arbitrary cross-sections. This finding adds to 
the existing solvable configurations of 
composite shafts under torsion. 
Keywords: Saint-Venant torsion, torsional 
rigidity, upper and lower bounds, composite 
shafts. 
1. Introduction 
 4
one branch is dedicated to finding exact 
solutions of composite shafts. The other 
branch is aimed at exploring general 
properties of torsional behavior of composite 
shafts. The concept of neutral inclusion 
originated from the work of Mansfield 
(1953), in which it was proven that a cavity 
in an elastic medium can be reinforced as 
that for the uncut medium. The idea of 
neutrality has received renewed attention in 
the last decade and has a tremendous impact 
in the field of different branches of research. 
Related references include Ru (1998), 
Benveniste and Miloh (1999), Benveniste 
and Chen (2001) and Milton and Serkov 
(2001), Milton (2002). A neutral 
inhomogeneity in torsion was first studied in 
Chen, Benveniste and Chuang (2002). They 
showed that, under an end torque, a 
cylindrical inhomogeneity can be introduced 
into a homogeneous cylindrical shaft without 
altering the warping function in the host shaft. 
Using the concept, we are able to construct 
an exactly solvable microgeometry in torsion. 
Further we proved rigorously that, for 
confocal elliptical inhomogeneities, to ensure 
neutrality the confocal ellipses need to be 
aligned in such a way that their major axes 
are along the radial directions of the circular 
host shaft. This is another solvable 
microgeometry - Composite Ellipses 
Assemblage. We found that the torsional 
rigidity of such a composite shaft depends on 
the size distribution of the composite 
cylinders which fills completely the circular 
rod. The importance of this work is that this 
is the first exact microgeometry that is 
amenable to exact torsional rigidity for a 
circular composite cross-section. Following 
the 2002 paper, which is restricted for 
circular shafts, Chen (2004) made a further 
attempt by allowing that the cross section of 
the host shaft could be arbitrary in shape. 
This work proves that an CCA configuration 
still permits an exact determination of the 
torsional rigidity of an arbitrary shaft 
provided the composite cylinders are 
sufficiently multiply coated. The number of 
multiple coatings necessary to achieve the 
neutrality condition depends on the 
geometric shape of the host shaft. Ting, Chen 
and Li (2004) later elaborated further along 
this line of developments, allowing that the 
constituents (reinforcements) can be 
cylindrically orthotropic or graded along the 
radial direction. 
For the issue of imperfect bonding, there has 
been a growing interest in the study of 
imperfect interfaces. Imperfect bonding can 
be used to simulate the imperfectness of the 
bonding, and also as an approximation to the 
effect of a thin coating between the phases, 
and in partcular as the surface stress effect, 
an important phenomena in nanoscaled solids 
or structures. Some recent advances were 
reported from various perspectives in the 
contexts of elasticity and conduction 
(Torquato 1995, Niklasson 2000, Ting 2007, 
Lipton 1995, 1996) Benveniste and Chen 
(2001) showed that the interface condition in 
torsion can be simulated as a limiting 
representation of a thin interphase of either 
low or high shear modulus. The first type of 
interface is called LS-type (low stiffness), 
and the second type is called HS-type (high 
stiffness). Interface parameters defined in 
terms of the thickness and shear modulus of 
the interphase characterize both types of 
imperfect interfaces. Very interesting we 
recently found that the mathematical 
framework for the HS-type of interface is 
exactly the same with that of interface 
conditions (Young-Laplace equations) with 
surface/interface stress (Chen et al. 2006). 
As to the variational Bounds for the torsional 
rigidity of composite shafts, Alvino and 
Trombetti (1985) showed that circular cross 
sections with a radially nonincreasing 
arrangement of compliance deliver the 
maximum torsional rigidity among all cross 
sections with given cross-sectional area and 
fixed area fraction of the constituent phases. 
A comprehensive study on torsional rigidity 
bound is the work by Lipton (1998,1999). In 
these two papers, Lipton studied the case of 
composite shafts with imperfect interfaces 
where the condition of the continuity of the 
warping displacement has been relaxed (i.e., 
LS type). A variety of bounding theorems on 
the torsional rigidity was derived. In the case 
of perfectly bonded interfaces, Lipton and 
Chen (2004) developed a variational 
approach for bounding the torsional rigidity 
of shafts containing coated fiber 
 6
graded materials. We mention that the 
present proposition for the graded material is 
not a fortuitous example of finding field 
solutions of differential equations. Rather it 
is inspired by the emerging subject of 
designing cloaking layer based on 
transformation optics (Pendry et al. 2006). 
2. Solution procedure for cylindrical 
shafts reinforced with coated 
fibers subjected to torsion 
We present an abridged description of the 
solution procedure for composite shafts 
reinforced with arbitrarily or periodically 
dispersed coated fibers We consider a 
composite shaft which is composed of a 
homogeneous isotropic matrix containing 
N  isotropic coated fibers. The shaft has 
circular cross section with radius .R  The 
fibers also have circular cross-sections and 
are coated by a shell of isotropic material of 
uniform thickness. The radius of the k th 
fiber, 1, , ,k N   is denoted by ,ka  and 
the outer radius of the k th coating is 
denoted by .kb  Each coated fiber may have 
different constituent materials with different 
area fractions. The shear modulus of the 
matrix is denoted by m , and those for the 
fibers and the coatings are, respectively, 
 k
f  and  kc . At the interfaces between 
any two adjacent phases we consider that 
they are perfectly bonded. We will first 
consider that the coated fibers are arbitrarily 
dispersed inside the host shaft. For 
convenience, the cross-section of the shaft is 
denoted by ,  and its outer boundary by 
.  Let us now introduce a Cartesian 
coordinate system  , ,x y z  positioned at the 
center point O  of the circular ,  and also 
let z  be the axial direction along the shaft 
(and the fiber) direction. We suppose that the 
k th coated fiber is positioned at the point 
kO  inside the cross-section   with 
coordinates ( , )k kx y  relative to the origin of 
.x  The domain occupied by the k th coated 
fiber is denoted by 
     2 2 2{ },k k k kx x y y b       in which 
the domain of the k th fiber is denoted by 
 k
f  and that of the coating is by  kc . The 
union of all the fibers is denoted by f  and 
that of the coating by .c  The remaining 
part of the cross-section containing the 
matrix material is denoted by m  so that 
m f     .c  We will also denote the 
interface between the k th fiber and the k th 
coating by   ,kf  and that between the k th 
coating and the surrounding matrix as  .kc  
The displacement field of cylindrical shafts 
under Saint-Venant's torsion can be 
described as 
1 ,u yz  2 ,u xz  3 , ,u x y  where 
  is the angle of twist per unit length of the 
shaft. The function   is the axial 
displacement of the cross-section, commonly 
referred to as warping function or 
displacement. The warping function typically 
varies from point to point in the cross-section, 
but is virtually independent of the axial 
direction for cross-sections sufficiently far 
away from the ends (Horgan 1989). The 
non-zero strains   and stresses   
corresponding to the deformation field are 
   with  x       where

For perfectly bonded interfaces, the warping 
displacement   and the shear traction 
3i in  are continuous across the interfaces 
. Equilibrium condition 0   
suggests that   be harmonic inside .  
Since   is harmonic, one can construct a 
complex torsion function ( )w z   
( ) i ( )z z  , of the complex variable 
i ,z x y   where   is the conjugate 
harmonic function, related to   . As the 
interfaces are all perfectly bonded, the field 
equations can be rewritten as

Similar constraint conditions can be 
established for   ,kc  2, , ,k N   based 
on different local coordinates. These will 
allow us to construct the continuity 
conditions along the interfaces  kc . In 
summary, the interface conditions along the 
coating-matrix interface in (2.2) 2 and 
(2.2) 3 will give the constraints for 
1,p N  . Similarly we can derive the 
interface conditions along  .kf  The

3. Cylindrical shafts reinforced with 
periodic coated fibers 
We now consider the case that the coated 
fibers are spatially periodic inside the 
circular   . Without loss of generality, we 
can consider a configuration in which the 
composite shaft possesses a rotational 
symmetry of degree 2 / .N  That is the 
coated fibers are uniformly distributed along 
the circumferential direction. We will now 
present a simple algorithm, showing that the 
number of unknown coefficients for the field 
solutions can be greatly reduced.

x y  coordinates, (b) a rotated ˆ ˆx y  coordinates. 
 
To outline the procedure, we first consider 
two configurations of a circular shaft 
containing one circular coated fiber (Fig.1).

5. Some verifications and illustrative 
examples 
To compare our numerical solutions with 
known examples, we first consider the 
configuration of a circular host shaft 
containing one fiber, where the fiber and the 
host shaft are not concentric. Muskhelishvili 
(1953, §140a) had derived an analytic 
solution of the torsional rigidity using a 
complex variable method together with 
conformal mapping technique. Here we 
calculate our numerical solutions for the 
geometric parameters 
1 1/ 0.3, / 0.6a R z R   for various ratios of 
 1 / .f m   The torsional rigidity 
 / mT T T    is a non-dimensionalized 
quantity with respect to the homogeneous 
shaft made of pure matrix material. Our 
calculated ,T   with a 20  series-term 
approximation, agree very well with the 
analytic result of Muskhelishvili (1953) and 
also with the numerical method based on a 
null-field integral approach (Chen and Lee 
2009). In addition, we consider a periodic 
configuration of a circular host shaft 
containing 4 periodic fibers. The material 
and geometric parameters used for 
calculations are 
 12
 ˆ ˆ, ,x y  where   is the polar angle 
measured counterclockwise from the x  axis. 
That is ˆ cosx x r    and ˆ sin .y y r    
The displacement field of the host shaft (5.1) 
can be expressed based on the new 
coordinate as as a trigonometric series with a

Suppose now that the graded cylinder is

Our objective is to explore the relation 
between the shear moduli of the graded 
cylinder and the host shaft so that inserting 
the graded cylinder does not disturb the 
warping field in the host shaft under torsion. 
This requires that the continuity conditions 
of warping displacement and shear traction 
are perfectly matched along the interface

8. A neutral coated cylinder 
We now extend to the case when the host 
shaft containing a coated cylinder instead of 
a cylinder. Suppose that the cylinder and the 
coating are both made of graded materials 
with cylindrically orthotropic property. We 
denote the radius of the fiber as a  and the 
outer radius of the coating as .b  The shear 
moduli of the fiber again have the forms (7.5) 
and those of the coating have the expressions
