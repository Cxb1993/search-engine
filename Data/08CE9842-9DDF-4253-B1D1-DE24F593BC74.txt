Tab. 1 Experimental Parameters
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) is used to analyze the crystalline structure, Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the surface roughness of the nitride film and Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy is used to observe th surface structure and
thickness.
During the process of fabrication Si3N4 was deposited on double side polished
silicone wafer by LPCVD as the structure membrane. The Ti electrode is patterned and
deposited on the Si3N4 film by electron beam. The AlN is then sputtered on top of the
electrode and finally another lithography is done to patterned electrode as shown in Fig.1.
Back etching is done by KOH to create a window.

Results
I. Effect of Sputtering power
Working pressure set at 3mtorr, Nitrogen percentage 70％, no heating, sputtering
time 3hr, distance 6cm the XRD, FWHM, and AFM results at different power levels are
shown in Figs.2, 3 and 4.
Sputtering power(watt) 175W～275W
Working pressure (mtorr) 1～15
Nitrogen percentage (％) 40～90
Target distance (cm) 5～7
Sputtering time (hr) 1～5
increases as the power increases until 250W and then decline as the power reaches 275W.
From Fig. 3 the FWHM decreases as the power increases and increases as it reaches
275W. Also from Fig. 4 the surface roughness decreases as the power increases and then
increases as the power reaches 275W. All these results show that the increase of power
favor the growth of the film but as the power is too large (275W) the reverse effect
occurs.
II. Effect of working pressure
Sputtering condition is set at: sputtering power 250W, nitrogen percentage 70%, no
heating, sputtering time 3hrs and sputtering distance 6cm, the working pressure is varied.
The results are as shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7.
Fom Fig. 5 when working pressure is between 3 and 6 mtorr single <002> peak can
be seen in the XRD plot. As the pressure increases <002> peak gets weaker while <100>
and <101> appear. From Fig. 6 the FWHM increases as the pressure increases and the
best condition is at 3mtorr. Fig. 7 also shows minimum roughness at 3mtorr pressure.
From these results we can see that the optimum working pressure is at 3mtorr. Fig. 8 is
the FESEM results at different pressures. Similar to above results at 3mtorr the granular
structure is the best.

Sputtering condition is set at: sputtering power 250W, no heating, sputtering time 3hrs
and sputtering distance 6cm, the working pressure is varied. The results are as shown in
Figs. 9, 10 and11.

IV Effect of target distance
Sputtering condition is set at: sputtering power 250W, no heating, sputtering time
3hrs and, the working pressure is 3mtorr and N2 ratio is 70%, the target distance is varied.
The results are as shown in Figs. 12, 13 and 14.
From Fig. 12 <002> C-axis strength is effected by the target distance with optimal
condition at 6cm. Also we can see from Fig. 13 that the FMHW of <002> is optimal at
6.5cm and from Fig. 14 the roughness is the smallest at 6cm. These are all consistent
with the XRD results.

Abstract-Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5)
thin film has high dielectric constant and
stable chemical properties. It is a good
solution for tunneling effect due to the
reduction of gate length in
semiconductors. In addition, it has high
refraction coefficient and band gap, thus
has potential application on solar cells.
From literatures, as grown in preferred
(2 0 0) axis crystalline structure it also
has good piezoelectric property (high k33)
and could be used in MEMS, resonator,
filters (FBAR, surface acoustic wave
devices). In previous studies, the growth
of preferred oriented Ta2O5 thin film was
performed at elevated temperatures
(>850 ) with metal Tantalum target.℃
This causes difficulties for IC
manufacturing process. We deposited
preferred oriented Ta2O5 piezoelectric
thin film by RF magnetron sputtering
process with sintered Ta2O5 target at
reduced temperature (400 ).℃ The
piezoelectricity and referred (2 0 0) axis
crystalline structure are demonstrated.
I. INTRODUCTION
Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) thin film
has high dielectric constant and stable
chemical properties. It is a good solution for
tunneling effect due to the reduction of gate
length in semiconductors. In addition, it has
high refraction coefficient (n=2.18 at
λ=550nm) and band gap at 4.2eV , thus has
potential application on solar cells. Ta2O5 thin
film was not widely studied for piezoelectric
applications. From limited literatures, as
grown in preferred (2 0 0) axis crystalline
structure it also has good piezoelectric
property (high k33) and could be used in
MEMS, resonator, filters (FBAR, surface
acoustic wave devices). The comparison of
material properties are listed in Table 1 and 2.
Compared to ZnO and AlN, Ta2O5 thin film
has higher electrical mechanical coupling
coefficient and medium acoustic speed. In
demonstrated. The effective K233 calculated is
about 5.14%. This is higher than the previous
data and may be regarded as caused by
different substrates. The SEM picture is as
shown in Figure 9. The grain size estimated is
very close to the value obtained from Scherrer
formula. The surface roughness was measured
by AFM and the result was shown in Figure
10. The RMS value of roughness is about 4nm
which is good enough for later SAW
applications. In reviewing the material
properties of Ta2O5 thin film, the density is
about twice of AlN and ZnO which means it
contribute twice of acoustic impedance. For
stacked FBAR structure the Ta2O5 thin film
may be combined with other material to obtain
higher resonating performance.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Piezoelectric Ta2O5 thin film was
synthesized at low temperature (400℃) by
RF-magnetron sputtering. The preferred [2 0 0]
axis oriented crystalline structure is examined
from XRD although the exact point group has
to be identified later. The piezoelectric
property is demonstrated from impedance
measurement and the exact value of electrical
/ mechanical coupling coefficients for SAW
will be analyzed later.
