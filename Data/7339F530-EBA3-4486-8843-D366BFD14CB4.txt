ABSTRACT 
A vehicle traveling on the road exerts a dynamic load on the pavement system. A realistic prediction 
of pavement response can be achieved by using a dynamic finite element analysis. However, the 
computational model of the finite element method is restricted to a finite domain, and the pavement 
system belongs to half space. Because of this, the use of finite element modeling for an unbounded 
medium problem is a difficult task, and it is necessary to use a special boundary technique to 
consider the radiation condition of the unbounded domain into the finite element model. In this 
paper, the absorbing elements are installed inside the finite element domain to simulate half-space 
conditions, and they can absorb propagating wave in the dynamic analysis and prevent wave 
reflection from the bottom boundary. The efficiency of absorbing elements are verified first, then 
the elastic structural response of pavement under three different vehicle speeds are studied. Finally, 
the developed program is incorporated with the plasticity model to predict the permanent 
deformation of pavement under the repeated traffic loading.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The structural analysis and rutting prediction are the two most important research subjects for the 
highway pavement researchers. The structural analysis is to compute the displacements and stresses 
in the pavement systems under vehicle loading, and the rutting is the permanent deformation of 
pavement under repeated traffic loading. Currently most flexible pavement analyses are based on 
mechanistic-empirical procedures which can not predict the realistic response of the real pavement 
system. In this study, the elastic dynamic and elasto-plastic dynamic finite element methods are 
used for the pavement analysis, so the more rational prediction of pavement response can be 
obtained under the dynamic load of vehicle. 
In the past, the vehicle load was assumed to be a static in order to simplify the analysis of 
pavement, and the multi-layer elastic theory and static finite element method were used (1, 2). In 
practice, due to the dynamic force exerted on a pavement surface by the traffic load, pavement 
researchers started to use a dynamic approach for pavement analysis (3,4,5). The finite element 
method is one of the most popular tools for dynamic analysis of pavement. However, in this 
approach, a finite element model is restricted to a finite domain. In order to model an unbounded 
pavement system with a finite domain, different techniques have been proposed in order to prevent 
the wave reflection from the boundary. These are required in order to simulate the radiation 
condition of the truncated unbounded domain with the finite element method (6). An early 
technique was the consistent boundary method (7). However, this approach is frequency dependent 
and thus inapplicable to nonlinear analysis in a time domain. Later, the transmitting boundary was 
formulated based on the theory of wave propagation using this approach the radiation condition of 
an unbounded domain can be modeled. The most popular transmitting boundaries are viscous 
boundary (8), superposition boundary (9), and paraxial boundary (10). In this study, the absorbing 
element (11) is incorporated with the dynamic finite element program (12) to perform a structural 
analysis of pavement.

2.2 The Absorbing Element 
In this section, the absorbing element and its incorporation with a finite element method is 
introduced. First, an infinite pavement system is subjected to dynamic load as shown in Fgure 1. 
The system is divided into two sub-domains ΩI and ΩE with the imaginary interface boundary Γ. 
The interior domain ΩI is bounded while the exterior domain is unbounded. The governing equation 
of this system is the Biot equation. Akiyoshi found the solution by using the Fourier Transformation. 
The traction at point P in Fgure 1 can be calculated as:

Where ρ is the density of the material,  and are the velocity in the x and z direction, Vzu& xu& 1 and 
V3 are the compression wave velocity and shear wave velocity, and λ and μ are Lamè’s constant. 
The tractions σzz and σzx are local transient impedance on the interface boundary Γ, and they are also 
called the absorbing boundary condition. From the axismmetric finite element formulation and the 
principle of virtual work, the absorbing element matrix [C] a can be expressed as:

where {N} and [C0] can be expressed as:

an absorbing element matrix will be added to a damping matrix in Equation (1) when the element is 
specified as an absorbing element. 
 
3. THE EFFICIENCY OF ABSORBING ELEMENT 
The pavement system subjected to the dynamic load belongs to half space problem, but the finite 
element model is restricted to a finite domain. It is important to investigate the effect of boundary to 
the dynamic response of pavement. The three-layer pavement system as shown in Figure 3 is used 
 3
boundary is used and the absorbing elements are placed in the middle depth of the pavement. 
 
4.1 Elastic response of pavement 
The dynamic structural response of three-layer pavement under three different repeated 
loads are studying. The pavement structure and material properties are shown in Figure 3. The three 
different types of loading are shown in Figure 10, and it can be seen that the load type is periodic  
a half sine load with the rest period, and the rest period is three times of the load duration. The three 
types of load duration are 0.008s,0.05s and 0.024s which can represent the vehicle speeds of 90 
Km/hr, 50 Km/hr, and 30 Km/hr, respectively. Figure 11 shows the vertical displacement of 
pavement at the center of loading area under three different types of load. It can be seen that the 
peak displacement is reached when the peak load occurs. The peak displacement increases when the 
vehicle speed decreases. In the stresses analysis, the vertical stresses at two different depths of 
locations are investigated. Figure 12 shows the vertical stresses at the depth of 20 cm under the 
center of loading area ( near the bottom of the asphalt concrete) for the three different vehicle 
speeds. It can be seen that the maximum vertical stresses are close to 105 kPa for three different 
types of vehicle speed. The vertical stresses under the center of the loading area are shown in Figure 
13 for three different types of vehicle speed, and the maximum vertical stresses are approximate to 
520 kPa which are higher than that of the 480 kPa tire pressure. From these results, it can be 
observed that the vertical stresses decrease very fast in the asphalt concrete layer for three layer 
pavement system. It can also be seen that vertical stress decreases to zero after the load is removed, 
and the stress shows a periodic response. The above results also shows that the maximum vertical 
stresses are close from these three different vehicle speed loads. 
 
4.2 Elasto-plastic response of pavement 
In this section, the elasto-plastic dynamic finite element is incorporated with the absorbing 
element so that it can be used to predict the dynamic response of half space pavement. The simple 
and two-parameter of Drucker-Prager model is selected for the elasto-plastic analysis of pavement 
under different repeated traffic vehicle loads. The yield surface f of this model is shown below: 
kJJf D −−= 12 α                                                             (17) 
where 　 and k are material properties, J2D and J1 are the second and first stresses invariants. From 
the flow rule and consistency condition, the elasto-plastic stress-strain relationship can be derived, 
and this constitutive equation is used in the finite element formulation. The structure of pavement is 
also shown in Figure 3. The 480 kPa and 520 kPa peak tire pressures are considered in this analysis. 
The material properties for the Drucker-Prager model are shown in Table 1. The displacement 
responses of the three vehicle speeds for 480 kPa tire pressure are shown in Figure 14. It can be 
seen that the peak displacement decreases as the vehicle speed increases, and it is also shown that 
the permanent deformation is developed after the load is removed. The results also show that the 
permanent deformation increase slightly with the number of load repetition, and the peak 
displacements at the first load cycle is greater than that of the elastic analysis as shown in Figure 11 
for three different types of vehicle speed. The reason for this result is that the material is yield in 
this tire pressure. The vertical stresses at the bottom of the asphalt concrete for three different types 
of vehicle speed are shown in Figure 15. It shows that the maximum vertical stresses are close for 
these three speeds, and there are also the vertical residual stresses developed at the end of each load 
cycle, and the residual stress increases as the vehicles speed increases. In should be noted that there 
are no residual stress developed in the elastic analysis. 
The tire pressure is the major factor on the elasto-plastic analysis of pavement. The dynamic 
response for tire pressure 520 kPa is studied. Figure 16 shows the displacement responses at the 
center of loading for different vehicle speed, and the similar response results are obtained. However, 
the permanent deformation will increase with the number of load cycle, and the increase rate for the 
speed of 90 km/hr is greater than those of the response of the vehicle speed 50 km/hr and 30 km/hr. 
From these results, it is also shown that the tire pressure is one of the major factors to cause the 
pavement rutting. Figure 17 shows the vertical stress responses at the bottom of asphalt concrete for
