z Abstract 
Keyword: fuzzy modeling, TSK, fuzzy regression, outlier, rough set . 
 
For most real-world control and signal processing problems, the information 
concerning design, evaluation, realization, etc. can be classified into two kinds: (1). 
Numerical information obtained from sensor measurements. (2). Linguistic 
information obtained from human experts. For high nonlinearly or unknown systems, 
the interest is toward data-driven methods for obtaining the system model from above 
two kinds information. Fuzzy-rule-based modeling is a suitable tool that combines 
good approximation properties with a certain degree of inspect ability. To overcome 
these problems, a number of studies on fuzzy modelling have been proposed. These 
approaches use a fuzzy clustering method; TSK model approaches, in which output 
variables of each rule, i.e. fuzzy partitioned subspace, are expressed by a linear 
combination of input variables. The rough set theory, introduced by Pawlak in 1985, it 
is successes to deal with imprecise, incomplete or uncertain for information system. 
Fuzzy set and the rough set theories turned out to be particularly adequate for the 
analysis of various types of data, especially, when dealing with inexact, uncertain or 
vague knowledge. The rough set methodology is based on the premise that lowering 
the degree of precision in the data makes the data pattern more visible. In this project, 
we will propose an novel algorithm, which termed as, we will propose a novel 
algorithm for fuzzy modeling, termed as Rough-based fuzzy C-regression model 
(RFCRM), that define fuzzy subspaces in a fuzzy regression manner and also include 
Rough-set theory for TSK modeling with robust capability against or weaken outliers.

 The fuzzy C-regression model (FCRM) clustering is a 
modified version of FCM. The FCM algorithm is proposed 
by Bezdek[3] and its cost function is defined as

2.2 Rough sets 
The rough set theory [15,16] is a mathematical theory 
dealing with uncertainty in data. Rough sets rely on the 
notion of lower and upper approximations of a set. A rough 
set X is characterized by its lower and upper 
approximations BX and BX , respectively, with the 
following properties. 
1) An object  can be part of at most one lower 
approximation. 
kx
2) If Bk X∈x  of cluster X, then simultaneously 
Bk X∈x . 
3) If  is not a part of any lower approximation, then it 
belongs to two or more upper approximations. This permits 
overlaps between clusters. 
kx
That is, the lower approximation BX is the union of all 
the elementary sets which are subsets of X, and the upper 
approximation BX  is the union of all the elementary sets 
which have a nonempty intersection with X. The BX - BX  
is the representation of an ordinary set X in the 
approximation space called the rough set of X.   
 
3. Rough-Fuzzy C-Regression modeling 
Algorithm 
The Rough-Fuzzy C-Regression modeling (RFCRM) 
algorithm, it is integrated two contemporary progresses in 
analyzing vague data. One is the fuzzy set and the other is 
rough set. It is hybrid define fuzzy subspaces in a fuzzy 
regression manner and also data clustering. To combine 
those two cluster processes, a good choice of these two 
distance measures is a weighted average of them.  Its cost 
function is defined as

From above algorithm, the lager value of threshold ρ , the 
more likely is ( )x jG to lie within the rough boundary of a 
rule. The small value of ρ  implies that more patterns are 
allowed to belong to any of the lower approximations. In 
the other word, the ρ  represents the size of granules of 
rough-fuzzy cluster. Thereby, we can adjust the weighting 
parameter w  and/or lower approximation (or/and upper 
approximation) to weaken the outlier effect. It is reasonable 
to select 0.5 1w< < .  
The proposed RFCRM Algorithm is described in the 
following. 
The TSK fuzzy model obtained by the RFCRM 
algorithm has been with a level of accuracy. Furthermore,
