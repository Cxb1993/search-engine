disiloxane complex was purchased from UCT Co.
Epichlorohydrin was purchased from TCI. All chem-
icals were purified before use. Electronic grade
of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-F (830LVP) was
obtained from DIC Co, and 2-ethyl-4-methyl-1-
ethylcyanoimidazole (2E4MZCN) was purchased
from Shikoku Chemicals Co and used as the catalyst
for curing the epoxy and anhydride.
Synthesis of 5,5′-(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl disiloxane-
1,3-dilyl)-bis-norborane-2,3-dicarboxylic
anhydride (I)
The synthesis of siloxane-containing dianhydride (I)
was performed according to the method reported in
the literature (Scheme 1).18 The chemical structure of
the white product was confirmed with proton• and 13CAQ5
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 1H-NMR

Synthesis of N,N′-bis(4-hydroxylphenyl)-5,5′-
bis(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl disiloxane-1,3-diyl)-
bis-norborane-2,3-dicarboximide (II)
The siloxane-containing dianhydride (I) (30 g,
0.065 mol) was dissolved in 90 ml of dimethyl-
formamide (DMF), and 4-aminophenol (14.9 g,
0.136 mol) in 40 ml of DMF was gradually added
(Scheme 1). The solution was stirred for 8 h at ice-bath
conditions, followed by imidization using a Dean-
Stark instrument. Compound II in solid powder was
obtained after vacuum drying, and it was recrystallized
from isopropanol (38 g, yield = 91 %, mp = 123 ◦C).•AQ6

hydroxylphenyl)-5,5′-bis(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl
disiloxane-1,3-diyl)-bis-norborane-2,3-dicar-
boximide oligomer (III)
The synthesis of siloxane- and imide-containing
epoxy (III) was carried out according to a method
described previously.19 A three-necked flask equipped
with an addition funnel was filled with a solu-
tion of II (12.88 g, 0.02 mol) and epichlorohydrin
(37 g, 0.4 mol) (Scheme 1). A solution of NaOH
(1.6 g NaOH, 0.04 mol in 3.2 ml of H2O) was
added dropwise to the mixture, which was stirred
for 6 h at 65 ◦C•. The product was extracted three AQ7
times with toluene. The solvent and residual reac-
tants were removed by vacuum drying. The prod-
uct was then purified by column chromatography
using n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v = 1/1) as eluent
to obtain an oligomer of siloxane- and imide-
containing epoxy (III) with an epoxy equivalent
weight (EEW) of 477 g eq−1 by titration with HBr,
and a calculated average repeating unit of 0.34
(III in Scheme 1, where n = 0.34; yield = 92.6 %;
mp = 100–103 ◦C). Elemental analysis for III: (calcu-
lated) C = 64.84 %, N = 3.78 %, H = 6.53 %, O =
17.27 %; (found) C = 64.00 %, N = 3.78 %, H =

possibly have been due to the segmental motion of the
flexible siloxane. Nevertheless, it was noted that the
siloxane moiety was well dispersed in the crosslinked
network and it was hard to see phase separation
in the cured systems. This inference was confirmed
by the homogeneity of carbon-mapping scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), oxygen-mapping SEM
and silicon-mapping SEM of the cured systems
(Fig 4). All the mapping SEM results indicated
homogeneity and compatibility of the cured matrices.
Thermal degradation behaviour
The TGA thermograms of cured epoxy provided
valuable information regarding their thermal stability
and thermal degradation behaviour. TGA data of
these systems (Table 2 and Fig 5) indicated that
5 % weight loss in nitrogen atmosphere for III/I =
1/0.8 occurred in the range 320.7–365.9 ◦C•, and

(b) III/I = 1/1 in air; R2 corresponds to the correlation of the points.
as well as the mechanical properties. The thermal
degradation kinetic data, the SEM micrographs and
the ESCA results showed that during pyrolysis the
siloxane groups had been transformed into flaky silicon
dioxide as char residual, which further improved its
heat resistance by inhibiting the propagation of thermal
decomposition in the polymer matrix. This evidence
accounts for the fact that this siloxane- and imide-
containing epoxy material exhibited good thermal
stability with similar thermal degradation behaviour
in both N2 and air atmospheres.
