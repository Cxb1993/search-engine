英文摘要 
In a complex system, it is difficult for managers to identify a specific aspect of the system in 
isolation to evaluate service quality. The gap model of service quality, had been applied in 
different service industries, provides five gaps to evaluate service quality. However, a lacuna still 
exists in conducting a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model to empirically 
evaluate service quality. As a result, this study, based on the gap model of service quality, 
provides a fuzzy MCDM model to evaluate the performance of services in a movie theater. This 
fuzzy MCDM model integrated the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory 
(DEMATEL) method, the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) method and the fuzzy VIKOR 
(VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian), and provides a complete 
process to evaluate the five gaps of service quality empirically. The managerial strategies would 
be analyzed and diagnosed by the importance-performance analysis (IPA). The research results 
show that customers emphasize the dimension of service quality “Assurance” mostly. The he 
dimension of service quality “Assurance” is also mapped in Quadrant I with higher priority of 
improvement.

therefore, service quality can be defined as the extent of discrepancy between customers’ 
expectations or desires and their perceptions (Zeithaml, Parasuraman & Berry, 1990). 
Parasuraman et al. (1985) established the gap model of service quality. The service gap 
model positions the key concepts, strategies, and decisions in services marketing in a manner that 
begins with the customer and builds the organization’s tasks around what is needed to close the 
gap between customer expectations and perceptions (Zeithaml, Bitner and Gremler, 2006). The 
central focus of the service gaps model is the customer gap which is the difference between 
customer expectations and perceptions. Firms need to close this gap in order to satisfy their 
customers and build long-term relationship with them. Customer perceptions are subjective 
assessments of actual service experiences; customer expectations are the standards of, or 
reference point for, performance against which service experiences are compared.  
Zeithaml et al. (1990) refined the original SERVQUAL instrument, a concise multiple-item 
scale with good reliability and validity that companies can use to better understand the customers’ 
expectations and perceptions. Research suggests that customers do not perceive quality in a 
unidimensional way but rather judge quality based on multiple factors relevant to the context 
(Zeithaml et al., 2006). Service quality is an evaluation that reflects the customer’s perception of 
five SERVQUAL dimensions: reliability, assurance, responsiveness, empathy, and tangibles. 
According to Zeithaml et al. (2006), reliability is ability to perform the promised service 
dependably and accurately. Responsiveness refers to willingness to help customers and provide 
prompt service. Assurance is employees’ knowledge and courtesy and their ability to inspire trust 
and confidence. Empathy is defined as the caring, individualized attention that the firm provides 
its customers. Tangibles are appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel, and written 
materials.  
For measuring the four provider gaps, provider gap 1 is different from the other three ones 
because it crosses the boundary between the customer and provider sides of the service gap 
model (Zeithaml et al., 1990). Therefore, the measurement of provider gap 1 requires a 
comparison of responses pertaining to expectations from both of customers and managers and the 
relative importance of the five dimensions would be included in the instrument of measurement. 
Provider gap 2 through 4 would be measured by asking samples of employees in the company 
participating to indicate their perceptions of the extent of those gaps.  
Because organizations offering services are highly interactive, labor intensive and performed 
in multiple locations, quality control is complicated (Zeithaml et al., 1990). It can be difficult to 
quantify precise values in a complex evaluation system of service quality performance. A

important’’ and ‘‘equally important’’ with respect to a fuzzy five level scale (Chiou & Tzeng, 
2001). That is, 1  represents “equally important” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 1, 3);
 
3  
represents “weakly important” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 3, 5); 5  represents “essentially 
important” with scale of fuzzy number (3, 5, 7); 7  represents “very strongly important” with 
scale of fuzzy number (5, 7, 9); 9  represents “equally important” with scale of fuzzy number (7, 
9, 9). 
For collecting data of customers’ satisfaction, the respondents evaluated the service quality on 
each criterion by using a five-point linguistic scale from “extremely dissatisfactory” to 
“extremely satisfactory.” That is, 1  represents “extremely dissatisfactory” with scale of fuzzy 
number (1, 1, 2);
 
2  represents “dissatisfactory” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 2, 3); 3  
represents “ordinary” with scale of fuzzy number (2, 3, 4); 4  represents “satisfactory” with 
scale of fuzzy number (3, 4, 5); 5  represents “extremely satisfactory” with scale of fuzzy 
number (4, 5, 5).  
In order to gain the influence among the five dimensions of service quality, the sample of 
high-level executives would be requested to fill out the DEMATEL questionnaire by using a 
five-point linguistic scale from “no influence” to “extremely high influence.” The computational 
technique is based on the fuzzy numbers defined by Mon et al. (1994). That is, 0  represents “no 
influence” with scale of fuzzy number (0, 0, 1);
 
1  represents “low influence” with scale of fuzzy 
number (0, 1, 2); 2  represents “medium influence” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 2, 3); 3  
represents “high influence” with scale of fuzzy number (2, 3, 4); 4  represents “extremely high 
influence” with scale of fuzzy number (3, 4, 4). 
For provider gap 1, managers would be asked to fill out the questionnaire pertain to 
managers’ perceptions of customers’ satisfaction and the relative importance customers attach to 
the criteria of service quality. For managers’ perceptions of customers’ preference, a fuzzy ANP 
five level scale would be used. That is,
 
1  represents “our customers would consider the two 
criteria are equally important” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 1, 3);
 
3  represents “our customers 
would consider the two criteria are weakly important” with scale of fuzzy number (1, 3, 5); 5  
represents “our customers would consider the two criteria are essentially important” with scale of 
fuzzy number (3, 5, 7); 7  represents “our customers would consider the two criteria are very 
strongly important” with scale of fuzzy number (5, 7, 9); 9  represents “our customers would 
consider the two criteria are equally important” with scale of fuzzy number (7, 9, 9). 
For managers’ perceptions of customers’ satisfaction, the managers evaluated the service 
quality on each criterion by using a five-point linguistic scale from “our customers would be

for the list of attributes. Then, the 
NRM can be built up by the horizontal axis vector ( )def defi iB R+ , which illustrates the importance 
of the attribute, and the vertical axis vector ( )def defi iB R− , which may separate the attributes into a 
cause group and an affected group. In general, when ( )def defi iB R−  is positive, the criterion is 
part of the cause group. On the other hand, if ( )def defi iB R−  is negative, the criterion is part of the 
affected group. Therefore, a causal graph can be created by mapping the dataset of 
( , )def def def defi i i iB R B R+ − ; this provides a valuable approach to decision-making. 
3.2.2 Finding the preference of criteria weights by fuzzy ANP based on the NRM 
The first step of the fuzzy ANP is to use the criteria of the entire system to form a fuzzy 
supermatrix C  through pair-wise comparisons. This is done by asking, “How important is one 
criterion compared to another criterion with respect to our interests or preferences?” The relative 
importance is determined using a fuzzy scale of 1  to 9 , which represents a range from “equal 
importance” to “extreme importance.” The general form of the supermatrix is seen in matrix C , 
where ijpqc  denotes the importance comparing the pth criterion in the ith attribute to the qth 
criterion in the jth attribute. The form of the supermatrix depends on the variety of the structure.  
The next step is computing the unweighted supermatrix W  for considering the relationships 
among the attributes. Therefore, the result (elements in total-influence matrix T ) obtained from 
the fuzzy DEMATEL would be used in computing the unweighted supermatrix W .

managerial strategies for reducing customer gaps. This study would apply the defuzzification of 
weight of each criterion as the relative importance value of each criterion, and then use the 
un-weighted relative distance to replace the performance and to represent as the relative 
unimproved distance. The defuzzification of un-weighted relative distance ( * *( ) / ( )pi i i if f f f
−− −    ) 
indicates the relative unimproved distance of the ith criterion ( )ic  (i.e., 
*
if  is the fuzzy value of  
the ith criterion ( )ic  of the ideal point; if
−  is the fuzzy value of  the ith criterion ( )ic  of the 
negative point; pif  is the fuzzy value of the ith criterion ( )ic ). Therefore, the unimproved 
distance (x-axis) and the importance value (y-axis) can be mapped on a two-axis map, the 
improvement strategies map of gap reduction. 
4. Research Results and Conclusions 
After analyzing 35 employee questionnaires by DEMATEL method, we found the defiB are (18.82, 
18.301, 19.28, 18.18, and 17.96); defiR  are (16.25, 18.67, 18.87, 19.84, 18.9); ( )
def def
i iB R+  are 
(35.07, 36.97, 38.15, 38.02, and 36.86); ( )def defi iB R− are (2.57, -0.38, 0.41, -1.66, and -0.94) on 
the five dimensions of service quality. 
The analysis of ANP includes employee analysis and customer analysis. In the employee 
analysis, the nonfuzzy weights iw  can be obtained, which are (5.63%, 5.86%, 5.63%, 5.56%, 
6.09%, 6.13%, 6.23%, 6.18%, 6.67%, 6.25%, 6.40%, 5.65%, 6.16%, 5.48%, 5.24%, 5.26%, 
5.58%); two of top three weights are in the dimension of service quality “Assurance.” In the 
customer analysis, the nonfuzzy weights iw  are (5.62%, 5.77%, 6.05%, 5.66%, 5.91%, 5.89%, 
5.95%, 5.94%, 6.24%, 6.17%, 6.25%, 5.81%, 5.93%, 5.70%, 5.63%, 5.70%, 5.78%); two of top 
three weights are in the dimension of service quality “Assurance.” 
 Then, we use the weights from ANP and consumer satisfaction to process VIKOR analysis. 
The research results show that the dimension of service quality “Responsiveness” has the largest 
gap to the customers’ ideal level; however, the employee think the dimension of service quality 
“Tangibles” has the largest gap to the customers’ ideal level. This plan also used IPA to analyze 
the improvement strategies. The results show that the dimension of service quality “Assurance” is 
mapped in Quadrant I with higher priority of improvement.
