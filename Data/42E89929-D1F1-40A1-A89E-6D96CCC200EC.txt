2hygric property of the material. Based on
least square curve fitting, the parameters can
be obtained when adjusting them to optimize
the fitting of the function to the data. The
parameters are very important for describing
the hygric property of the material to predict
the hygric behavior of the laminate such as
the induced hygric stress.
The theoretical function of the hygric
expansion derived from Fick's model can fit
the data very well. The gradient-dependent
model only provides a limited improvement
to the fitting which is not the major concern
of this study. The major contributions of this
study are: (1) developing the delicate
gradient-dependent diffusion model to
calculate the penetrant front [3] (advancing
boundary [1,4]), and (2) configuring the
experimental and analysis process for
obtaining the saturated hygric expansion
strain, diffusivity and gradient coefficient of
a plate.

for one-dimensional penetrant diffusing in
the media is given by

where c is penetrant concentration in the
media; t is diffusion duration; D is diffusivity,
and x is the coordinate of diffusion direction.
When the original of the coordinate x is set at
the center of the plate, the solution of c for
the penetrant diffusing through both surfaces
into a 2D-infinite plate with thickness h is
given by [1]

If the hygric expansion of the material is
proportional to the concentration [6], then the
in-plane hygric expansion strain of the plate
is given by [6]

 (4)
whereis the saturated hygric strain. For an
unidirectional composite laminate, the hygric
strain in the fiber direction is extremely small
[5,6]. This study focuses on the hygric
expansion in the in-plane fiber's transverse
direction due to moisture absorption through
both surfaces, which can be measured by the
suspension method [6] (Fig.2). The values of
and D can be derived by fitting Eq.(4) to
the data of the hygric expansion strain.
However, the penetrant needs time to
reach the core part of the media material [1],
indicating that Eq.(2) is improper because it
shows that immediately after the diffusion
begins, the c at the center of the plate (x=0)
becomes non-zero, regardless of how small t
is and how large h is. The value of c is very
small but definitely non-zero. This result
implies that very few molecules of the
penetrant can penetrate the material and
reach the deepest core part of the plate in no
time as the diffusion begins, and that cannot
be true.
This problem could not be solved until
Frisch, Wang, and Kwei published a different
model [2,3]. A first order derivative term was
included in Eq.(1), producing

whereis the coefficient for the first-order
derivative term of c w.r.t. x, gradient
coefficient. The model was named the
strain-dependent model. Two cases were
solved using the model, diffusions in
semi-infinite domain and a 2D-infinite plate
with finite thickness. The solutions indicate
an advancing boundary [1], showing that the
penetrant front moves progressively deeper
into the inner part of the material.
Nevertheless, the solution for the second case
does not satisfy the condition that the
penetrant concentration should be symmetric
