二、 緣由與目的 
 
1. Introduction 
 
It is well-known that audio stream transmitted are 
through Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] 
relying on UDP, which provides no loss recovery 
(unreliable). Using TCP rather than UDP, it may cause 
long delay to get obsolete data at receiver side. In the 
previous work [2], VVoIP is constructed in ARM-
based embedded platform rather than the earlier project 
implemented on x86 PC [3], as shown in Fig. 1, for the 
purpose of the use of mobile video phone call operated 
on P2P connection [4]. In order to tackle three crucial 
problems: head-of-line blocking, handover interruption, 
and non-real-time transmission, we have adopted PR-
SCTP protocol [5] instead of TCP. However, the 
computation load for real-time video phone call is so 
big and has caused ARM-based embedded platform [6] 
no longer with power-saving. Moreover, VVoIP need 
to know their respective IP address between two 
mobile devices before P2P connection. Three kinds of 
handoff between embedded platform or mobile devices 
have been shown in Fig. 2 to 4. 
In order to resolve the problems as mentioned 
above, this study is to realize a real-time video/voice 
over IP (VVoIP) applications that has implemented by 
a Hadoop cloud computing and it is denoted CLC-IHU. 
Next based on client/server architecture users employ 
web interface to achieve VVoIP connection with thin 
clients and video phone call adopts an easy TCP 
connection instead of the complicated PR-SCTP 
protocol because of web interface not supported by 
PR-SCTP. User does not need to know what is a real 
IP used to ring a video phone call. In addition, cloud 
computing server has been protected by the access 
control according to the mechanism of authentication, 
authorization, and accounting (AAA) [7]. Hadoop 
cloud computing [8] together with access control by 
employing the rapid identification of face and 
fingerprint has been realized in order for preventing 
illegal intrusions from the outside of the cloud. Here, 
we use the standard J2ME [9] environment for 
embedded devices, where JamVM [10] virtual machine 
is employed to achieve J2ME environment and GNU 
Classpath [11] is used as the Java Class Libraries. 
 
2. Cloud Computing and VoIP 
Applications 
 
Cloud computing is an emerging and increasingly 
popular computing paradigm, which provides the users 
massive computing, storage, and software resources on 
demand. How to program efficient distributed parallel 
applications is complex and difficult. How to dispatch 
a large scale task executed in cloud computing 
environments is challenging as well. 
Currently on the market the most popular cloud 
computing services are divided into public clouds, 
private clouds, community/open clouds, and hybrid 
clouds, where Goggle App Eng [12], Amazon Web 
Services [13], Microsoft Azure [14] - the public cloud; 
IBM Blue Cloud [15] - the private cloud; Open Nebula 
[16], Eucalyptus [17], Yahoo Hadoop [18] and the 
NCDM Sector/Sphere [19] - open cloud; IBM Blue 
Cloud [15] - hybrid cloud. 
Two famous companies related to IP phone via 
cloud computing are voice over IP in a Cloud, IIS 
2009 [20] and VoIP in cloud computing, Skpye in 
2010 [21]. In Taiwan, Chunghwa Telecom provides 
Hicloud with two services: CaaS and StaaS [22], 
Innovative DigiTech-Enabled Applications & Services 
Institute at III [23] gives public cloud computing 
services, National Center for cloud computing at 
NARL delivers training courses for cloud computing 
[24], and Cloud computing Center for Mobile 
Application at ITRI contributes the efforts in Container 
Computer, Cloud OS, and Application [25]. 
 
3. Video/voice over IP on Cloud 
Computing 
 
In this study, the VVoIP application program does 
not need to be installed inside mobile devices. It has 
been set up in the Hadoop cloud computing server [26] 
[27] so that web interface is applicable to run and 
browse video phone call between cloud computing 
server and thin clients as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, 
instead of complicate PR-SCTP protocol a simple and 
easy control transmission protocol TCP is employed in 
such a client/server structure rather than P2P 
connection as we did before. Video/voice streaming 
over IP can be implemented in such a bidirectional 
connection between thin-client type of Linux or 
WinCE embedded platforms. Users do not need to get 
both actual IPs in advance; instead they get into 
Hadoop cloud computing server to catch VVoIP 
service directly for initiating video phone call 
connection and cloud computing will be looking for 
the other side to accomplish phone call link between 
two client sites. 
 
三、 結果與討論

noticed that the power consumption is really reduced 
dramatically in mobile device when we adopt cloud 
computing scheme, CLC-TCP, for a real-time on-line 
video phone call. 
In the application of VVoIP running in Hadoop 
cloud computing, the handoff delay time can achieve 
less than 1.7 sec as shown in Table 2. In order to verify 
the effectiveness and efficiency in access control for 
preventing illegal intrusions from the outside of the 
cloud, the rapid face recognition and fingerprint 
identification in Hadoop cloud computing has been 
done successfully within 2.2 seconds, as shown in 
Table 1, to exactly cross-examine the subject identity. 
As a result the proposed approach outperforms the 
other alternatives due to fast response and low 
misclassification rate like EER in access control. 
 
四、 計畫成果自評 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
In the previous work, VVoIP application program 
must be installed in mobile devices. In this study we 
have devoted to deploy the VVoIP applications to a 
Hadoop cloud computing server together with access control 
implementation of rapid facial and fingerprint 
identifications so that user can utilize web interface to 
interact with VVoIP services through the connection 
between thin client and cloud computing server. This 
client/server scheme reduces dramatically the 
computation load and power consumption for thin 
clients since the computation task of VVoIP is served 
in cloud computing server. We do not get the actual IP 
for each other before VVoIP connection. A simple and 
easy control transmission protocol TCP is applicable, 
instead of the complicated PR-SCTP, to implements 
the real-tome on-line video phone call for both clients. 
We have concluded that the approach we proposed 
here achieves a better performance and efficiency than 
the previous works.
