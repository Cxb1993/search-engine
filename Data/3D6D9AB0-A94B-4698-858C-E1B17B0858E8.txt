different groups for each service attribute by 
applying ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to identify 
significant demographic variables and then use 
those variables for market segmentations. Each 
cluster can be depicted by specific demographic 
information. The service attributes for each cluster 
can be classified into one of the four quadrants. 
Moreover, by refined Kano’s model, the 
preferences for each service attribute among the 
entire group and the clustered groups can be 
summarized by highly attractive, less attractive, 
high value-added, low value-added, critical, 
necessary, potential, or care-free attributes. 
Therefore, the decision maker can first figure out 
the major (relatively) strengths and weaknesses of 
service characteristics identified by P-IPA and then 
design different marketing strategies to provide 
different service characteristics for different groups 
to meet a variety of needs.

2. Introduction and Research Objectives 
Importance-performance analysis (IPA) as 
shown in Figure 1 was first proposed by Martilla 
and James (1977) to provide the management the 
insights by identifying the strengths and 
weaknesses of a particular company. IPA intends to 
identify the most important characteristics with the 
highest impact on customer satisfaction and, 
simultaneously, the low performance attributes 
required to be improved immediately (Matzler et al., 
2003; Deng et al., 2008; Wu and Shieh, 2010; 
Shieh and Wu, 2011). IPA is composed of four 
quadrants with different meanings (Daniels and 
Marion, 2006; Deng et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; 
Wu and Shieh, 2009; Shieh and Wu, 2009; Shieh 
and Wu, 2011). Quadrant I is “keep up the good 
work” with both high performance and high 
importance, which can be viewed as the major 
strength. Quadrant II is “possible overkill” that has 
high performance but low importance, and any 
characteristic situated in this quadrant means the 
resources committed are excessive and should be 
deployed elsewhere. Quadrant III means “low 
priority” which has the characteristics of both low 
performance and low importance, and these 
characteristics do not require additional efforts. 
Quadrant IV is “concentrate here” with low 
performance but high importance, which can be 
considered as major weaknesses for an organization. 
Immediate attention for improvement is required.

The most commonly seen approach to 
integrate IPA and Kano’s model is to use separate 
questions to gather the needed information. 
However, in the previous project with NSC 
98-2221-E-018-003, we integrate IPA and Kano’s 
model in the same questionnaire depicted in Table 
1 and propose perceived importance-performance 
analysis as shown in Figure 2.

3. Methodology 
The proposed P-IPA, refined Kano’s model, 
and ANOVA technique can be incorporated into the 
same study. First, use the questionnaire as shown in 
Table 1 and add one more question for the same 
quality attribute by asking the importance of this 
particular quality attribute. In order to be consistent 
throughout the study, a Likert-type five-point level 
can be used, where 5 represents highest importance, 
while 1 means lowest importance. In doing so, the 
integration of P-IPA and refined Kano’s model is 
depicted in Figure 4.

Model 
 
When the questionnaire was finished, we can 
determine the quadrant for each quality attribute by 
performance value and perceived importance value. 
Thus, each quality attribute can be plotted in one of 
the four quadrants and be known as one of the eight 
quality attributes by refined Kano’s model. Later, 
one-way ANOVA can be conducted to explore the 
differences between the demographic variables and 
quality attributes by identifying critical variables 
for market segmentation. For instance, we use 
Table 3 to show our philosophy. The highlighted 
area indicates the item is significant at a = 0.10 for 
each demographic variable. The more highlighted 
items, the more critical the demographic variable.

Demographic Variables 
 
 
When critical variables are identified, market 
segmentation can be practiced. For instance, if 
gender and traveling purpose are the two critical 
variables for market segmentation, the entire group 
can be classified into several smaller groups. For 
example, there are two types of gender, and there 
are six traveling purposes. Thus, we can divide the 
entire group into twelve (2´6). For each smaller 
group, the quality attribute for a particular item can 
be defined and the differences among groups can be 
identified for different marketing strategies. Table 4 
shows the philosophy, where abbreviations of HA, 
LA, HV, LV, C, N, P, and CF stand for high 
attractive quality, less attractive quality, high
