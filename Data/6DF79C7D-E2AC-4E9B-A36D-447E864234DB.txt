number of subsets of simultaneously active 
links (see [8], [13]), and thus the network 
performance degrades with a lower degree of 
spatial reuse. 
B、 Performance Analysis for WRNs 
WLAN technology has grown quickly in recent 
years, making the information easier to obtain 
by removing the limitations of wired cables. 
However, this convenience is limited within a 
radius of a hundred meters due to the original 
Medium Access Control (MAC) design and 
radio power. Providing ubiquitous BWA 
service is a major challenge for the 
telecommunication companies. Existing 
technologies exist to overcome such issues, 
such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), 
3rd Generation (3G) telecommunication and 
3.5 Generation (3.5G) telecommunication. 
However, all of these technologies have low 
system throughput, limiting their commercial 
success. The appearance of IEEE 802.16 [42, 
43] resolves the deployment issues of Wireless 
Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). 
IEEE 802.16 provides radio coverage from 
several miles to dozens of miles with data rates 
of up to 75Mbps (20MHz bandwidth, 16QAM 
3/4 modulation and coding rate). It completely 
meets the requirements for deploying the 
WMAN, and enables the provision of 
ubiquitous BWA services. The IEEE 
802.16-2004, provides only fixed access 
service, meaning that no mobility is supported 
for SS. It can be employed in backbone 
networks, backhaul and last-mile transmission, 
enabling new fixed network operators to 
provide Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) grade 
services to compete with existing operators. 
IEEE 802.16-2004 can enhance basic 
telecommunication constructions quickly 
without installing fixed lines into every 
building, making it more applicable for 
developing countries than for developed 
countries. 
IEEE 802.16e-2005, provides mobility support, 
enabling a Mobile Station (MS) to obtain 
information from the Internet. Such changes 
make IEEE 802.16 into a candidate for 4th 
Generation (4G) telecommunication technology, 
and threaten current 2G, 3G or 3.5G 
telecommunication systems. The appearance of 
IEEE 802.16e-2005 also enables ubiquitous 
BWA service, and enables applications such as 
mobile communication services and broadband 
service provision on buses.  
IEEE 802.16 has many advantages, but it 
suffers from the challenges in conventional 
wireless communication systems, such as 
asynchronous service demand and the radio 
propagation characteristics. An MS has a lower 
Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) value when the 
distance between it and a BS increases, either 
reaching the cell border or transmitting in Non 
Line Of Sight (NLOS). Low SNR values means 
the data rate between MSs and BSs is slow, 
making the ubiquitous BWA unavailable. The 
operators can place additional BSs to maintain 
the QoS to overcome this issue. However, the 
cost is high, resulting in a high service price to 
customers. To avoid making the same mistakes 
(the high license fee and deployment cost make 
high service price) in 3G mobile 
communication service, operators need to 
minimize the cost in order to provide cheap 
BWA service. Accordingly, the IEEE Task 
Group j is defining the 802.16j standard [40, 41] 
to enhance system throughput and maintain low 
5 
 
focused on the 802.16 performance evaluation, 
rather than 802.16j or specific frame structure 
that is not exactly the same as the one in 
802.16j. To help understand the performance of 
802.16j MR network, how it improves the 
802.16 network by specifying RS and the 
placement rules of RS, this study develops an 
802.16j module for ns-2, to evaluate the 
performance of 802.16j experimentally. 
C、 Joint Routing and Link Scheduling in 
WRNs 
Recently, IEEE 802.16j task group has been 
devoted to the development of multi-hop 
relaying technology as an enhancement for 
IEEE 802.16 point-to-multipoint networks. 
While IEEE 802.16j subscribers are expected to 
experience performance improvement through 
low-cost relay stations (RSs), the degradation 
of system throughput would occur instead if 
multi-hop radio resources can not be 
well-utilized. Consequently, the routing and 
link-scheduling algorithms, which are of the 
important resource control functions in 
multi-hop networks, shall be specifically 
re-designed to facilitate the effective use of 
network resources for WRNs. 
The link-scheduling issues have been 
extensively investigated in wireless multi-hop 
networks (WMNs) with or without quality of 
service (QoS) consideration. For instance, [20], 
[21], [22] target at QoS-sensitive services while 
the performance of best-effort traffic over 
WMNs is studied in [23], [24], [25], [26]. For 
non-QoS traffic, system throughput is 
considered as an essential performance 
criterion. Unfortunately, the problem of link 
scheduling for system throughput maximization 
in WMNs was proven to be ࣨ࣪-hard [26]. 
Due to the intractability of the problem, the 
previous works have focused on developing 
approximation algorithms for WMNs [23], [24], 
[25]. Besides, it was shown that cross-layer 
optimization takes the advantages over strictly 
layered design in mobile ad hoc networks [27]. 
The joint design of link scheduling and routing 
for WMN poses a challenging research 
problem. Among the research related to join 
routing and link scheduling, the solution in [28] 
requires exponential-time complexity with 
respect to the number of stations, and is 
intractable for large-scale networks. In [29], 
Wei et al. proposed an interference-aware 
scheme for joint routing and link scheduling to 
maximize the system throughput of 
WiMAX-based WMNs. However, the proposed 
heuristic scheme can not guarantee the 
worst-case performance. 
The previous schemes for WMNs could not 
properly applied to WRNs because of some 
inherent differences of routing and link 
scheduling for throughput maximization 
between WMNs and WRNs. The key 
discrepancies are substantially two-folds and 
described as follows. 1) In WRNs, RSs do not 
generate data traffic. This restriction may make 
the design of routing for throughput 
maximization in WRNs easier than that in 
WMNs. On the other hand, the routing problem 
in WRNs could be more difficult due to its 
limitation of transmission path of traffic flows. 
In a WMN, each node can exchange data 
packets with any other node in the network 
while a WRN traffic flow is either destined to a 
base station (BS) or delivered from a BS 
through one or more RSs. Such a limitation

802.16 standard with orthogonal frequency

underlying physical-layer technique [14]. The

by applying different modulation schemes and 
coding rates. The receiver minimum input level

link margin, and the PL(dB) is the transmission 
path loss. Since the MRs in WMBNs are 
assumed to be stationary and communicate 
without obstructions, the fading effects are 
negligible. We adopt two-ray ground reflection 
model as our path loss model. By substituting 
(3), (4) and (5) into (2), we can calculate the 
maximal transmission ranges for different 
modulation schemes with a certain SNRRX 
requirement. 
In addition to the channel model, the 
interference is a key parameter that governs the 
degree of spatial reuse. The Protocol model and 
the Physical model are both commonly used as 
the interference model. Since it had been 
shown that the Protocol model is equivalent to 
the Physical model when path-loss exponents 
are greater than two [15], we adopt the Protocol 
model defined in [16] without considering 
SINR to simplify the computation. In the 
Protocol model, when a node t transmits to a 
node r, the transmission is successful if

where d(t, r) is the distance between the nodes t 
and r. α is a power margin, and its value is 
always greater than zero. The node i is an 
arbitrary jammer that simultaneously transmits 
its data during the transmission period of the 
node t. 
2. Flow of Our proposed Mechanism 
We use a flowchart shown in Figure 2 to 
describe our proposed QoS-aware routing and 
scheduling mechanism. First, the gateway 
keeps listening to the bandwidth requests 
9 
 
“while” loop in line 8 of Algorithm 1), the 
gateway chooses a node v whose traffic 
demand D[v] is maximal in U[G]. Such a 
greedy method is adopted to reduce the 
complexity of our routing algorithm. Then the 
gateway selects a route with a minimal cost for 
v. After calculating the achievable bandwidth 
allocation along the path, the gateway subtracts 
the allocated bandwidth from the links along 
the selected path and from all of the interfered 
links of the path to avoid collisions. However, 
the subtracted quantities of bandwidth for these 
interfered links shall be differentiated since 
their link bit-rates might not be the same. Given 
that link (i, j) is delivering data with the traffic 
demand D[i, j]. Let S[m, n] be the subtracted 
bandwidth quantity of link (m, n) interfered by 
link (i, j). Then we have S[m, n] = D[i, j] R[m, 
n]/R[i, j]. Furthermore, the weight of each 
wireless link is closely related to the optimality 
of our routing results. We define the occupancy 
ratio of a link (i, j) as the weight W[i, j] of the 
link. The occupancy ratio of the link represents 
the allocated/occupied bandwidth under the 
interference consideration. It not only denotes 
the utilization of the link itself, but also 
represents an unusable ratio of channel 
bandwidth for the surrounding interfered links. 
A link with small occupancy ratio could 
contribute more resources than a large one. 
Thus our modified Dijkstra’s algorithm will 
select the path with high non-collision 
bandwidth under the interference consideration. 
The way also boosts the balancing degree of 
the network loading since selecting the links 
with heavy loading will be prevented.  
Once a path is selected by our routing 
algorithm, the noncollision bandwidth for the 
path can be then determined. We calculate the 
maximal achievable demand D’[v] via a linear 
programming formulation. The object is to 
maximize the achievable traffic demand of 
router v, i.e.,

4. Scheduling Algorithm 
Since the paths with the granted bandwidth 
(e.g., I[v] of router v) for each router can be 
determined in the routing stage, the traffic 
11 
 
the topology, and all of them used a modulation 
and coding rate of 16QAM 1/2. In the four-hop 
relay simulation model, the RSs could apply 
better modulation and coding rates than in the 
two-hop relay network, since the distance 
between two RSs in the same group might be 
shorter. Therefore, the RSs were symmetrically 
distributed in the topology, and all of them 
applied a modulation and coding rate of 
16QAM 3/4. 
The system performance of the three simulation 
models were evaluated using five performance 
metrics, namely the SNR distribution of SSs, 
system throughput, packet delay, packet jitter 
and packet loss ratio. The SNR distribution of 
SSs was used to determine whether the RSs 
could improve the signal quality of the SSs. 
The system throughput of the three simulation 
models was used to determine whether RSs can 
enhance the system throughput. The packet 
delay, packet jitter and packet loss ratio were 
adopted to evaluate the packet transmission 
characteristics to discover whether the RSs 
caused any side effects. To evaluate the five 
performance metrics of the three simulation 
models, every SS was set to generate CBR 
traffic from 256 Kbps to 2048 Kbps to observe 
their behaviors. 
The experiments with the frequency band set to 
3.5GHz and 30MHz bandwidth. Two channels 
are used to prevent interference, since the RSs 
were inside the coverage of BS. Therefore, the 
BS and RSs respectively utilized 3.47GHz and 
3.485GHz frequency bands, each with 15MHz 
bandwidth. Because the antenna in ns-2 was 
only an omni-directional antenna, a directional 
panel antenna was created to further reduce the 
interference in four-hop relay network to 
accommodate the 12 RSs inside the simulation 
model. 
Furthermore, each RS and SS in our 
experiments needed to be mapped to a 
modulation and coding rate to have its own 
data rate according to its SNR. The SNR was 
derived from the transmitted power, noise and 
path loss. The noise was derived from  
following equation in [46]: 
 
Here, BW denotes the bandwidth, and the path 
loss can be derived from the following 
equation according to [53]: 
 
Here, d denotes the distance between two nodes, 
and ¸ denotes the wave length. The received 
signal strength for SSs and RSs can be derived 
from the equation below: 
 
where Pt denotes the transmitted power of BSs 
or RSs. According to above three equations, the 
SNR of RSs and SSs can be derived from the 
equation below: 
 
These four equations were implemented in the 
802.16j module so that the RSs and SSs would 
dynamically determine their own SNRs, and 
then request BSs to communicate with them 
using the corresponding modulation and coding 
rate. The transmitted power of BSs, RSs and 
SSs in our experiments were 1W (1dBm), 0.5W 
13 
 
adjacent. This model reflects the primary 
interference, which captures the interference 
when a station 1) transmits packets to two 
different stations simultaneously, 2) receives 
packets from two different stations concurrently, 
or 3) transmits and receives packets at the same 
time. Another type of interference, namely, the 
secondary interference, occurs when a 
receiving station is interfered by other 
transmissions which are not intended for this 
station. We assume that the secondary 
interference can be avoided for the WRNs 
under investigation through the beam and null 
steering capability of smart antennas. 
Based on the above definition of the problem, 
our proposed solution for joint routing and link 
scheduling is developed to produce a 
transmission schedule such that the schedule is 
interference-free and the system throughput is 
maximized. Note that the throughput 
maximization problem in our study is 
equivalent to the minimization of the schedule 
length in terms of time-slots because the 
achieved system throughput is inversely 
proportional to the schedule length [24], [23], 
[30], [26].

the primary interference, any two transmissions 
that are originated/destined from/to a station 
can not be overlapped, and the schedule length 
would be limited by iρ . Consider a routing 
with a large iρ . The schedule length is 
inevitably large, regardless of which link 
scheduler is adopted. In order to minimize the 
schedule length, we shall find a routing such 
that }{max iin ρV∈  is minimized. To achieve 
this, the linear programming (LP) technique is 
used, and its objective function is 
               β  minimize  (11)

Note that we make no assumption on the

That is, the traffic load from each SS could be 
distributed to multiple routes to alleviate the 
network congestion. 
3. Makespan Link Scheduling 
Once the routing is determined, this section 
shows how we efficiently schedule the link 
traffic so that the schedule length can be 
minimized and the system throughput can be 
accordingly increased. Before presenting our 
scheduling algorithm, we define several terms 
used in this section. For each edge E∈),( ji , 
jit ,  represents the number of time-slots for 
15 
 
the well-known projective method [34]. Let 
)( cGΔ  be the maximal degree of vertices in 
cG . The time complexity of scheduling each 
time-slot in Algorithm IMS is { }( ))|E|,ΔE||E|O clg max× , because choosing a 
vertex 'V∈′in  takes { }( ))|E|,ΔE|O clg max  
time and at most || E  links could be scheduled 
to the slot. Thus Algorithm IMS requires { }( ))(|,|lg max|| cGO Δ× EEκ  computations. 
Since ||)( E≤Δ cG , the worst-case running 
time of Algorithm IMS will be )||( 2EκO , 
which is acceptable in a WMN/WRN network 
[5], [4], [10]. 
 
5. Worst-Case Performance Analysis 
In this section, a worst-case analysis for system 
throughput of our routing and link scheduling 
algorithm against any of optimal solutions is 
presented. For any )(τG  ( κτ ≤≤1 ), we 
construct a simple undirected graph 
)~,~(=~ )()()( τττ EVG  such that for each vertex 
)(τ
in  in 
)(τV , a clique )(τiC  with )()( iτl  
fully-connected vertices is added into )(~ τG . 
For any two different cliques, say )(τiC  and 
)(τ

)(τ
iC  is fully connected to 
)(τ
jC  if ),( ji  
is in )(τE . If ),( ji  is not in )(τE , )(τiC  and 
)(τ
jC  are disconnected. An example of the 
construction is shown in Figure 15, and the

三、 效能評估 
In this section, we present the capability of 
proposed approaches evaluated by a series of 
experiments as follows. 
A、 QoS Routing and Scheduling in 
WMBNs 
We evaluate the performance of our proposed 
19 
 
scheduling algorithm is interference-aware and 
our bandwidth calculation optimization can 
quantify the exact non-collision bandwidth. 
B、 Performance Analysis for WRNs 
In the experiments, the system performance is 
conduct by the self-developed IEEE 802.16j 
module. Figures 8 and 9 evaluate the system 
throughput under different traffic load in 
two-hop and four-hop relay networks 
respectively. It is shown that an appropriate 
relay zone ratio is critical to maximizing 
system throughput. This is because the number 
of maximum packets transmitted to the BS 
needs to be maximized. Analytical and 
experimental results indicate that the 802.16j 
module is feasible, and can be applied it to 
evaluate the performance of 802.16j MR 
networks. 
Figure 10 and 11 show the system throughput 
at different modulation and coding rates of RSs 
for two-hop and four-hop relay networks, with 
a relay zone ratio of 0.7. These figures show 
that increasing the modulation and coding rate 
of RSs improves the throughput. In Figure 10, 
64QAM 2/3 and 64QAM 3/4 had the same 
system throughput, because the RSs were able 
to relay more traffic than they received from 
SSs. The modulation and coding rate of RSs is 
also a key issue in improving system 
throughput. 
In addition to the average SNR and overall 
system throughput, the packet delay, packet 
jitter and packet loss ratio were also adopted to 
evaluate each system. Figure 12 shows the 
packet delays of each network, in which the 
ranking was four-hop relay network > two-hop 
relay network > conventional 802.16 network 
with increasing data rate of SSs. This result 
indicates that the delay is highest when the 
using an 802.16j MR network, and is 
proportional to the number of hops between BS 
and SSs. This is a drawback for utilizing 
802.16j MR networks. 
Figure 13 shows the packet jitter values, which 
are ranked as four-hop relay network > 
two-hop relay network > conventional 802.16 
network. The packet jitter was highest in the 
802.16j MR network, and was also proportional 
to the number of the hops between BS and SSs. 
This is also a drawback of 802.16j MR 
networks.  
Figure 14 shows the packet loss ratios, which 
were ranked as conventional 802.16 network > 
four-hop relay network > two-hop relay 
network when SS data rates above 768Kbps. 
The rank order of packet loss ratios when the 
data rate was less than 768Kbps was 
conventional 802.16 network > two-hop relay 
network > four-relay network. This is because 
the 802.16j MR network had a better system 
throughput than the conventional 802.16 
network, and RSs can help to buffer packets. 
More RSs can buffer more packets, meaning 
that the packet loss ratio of the two-hop relay 
network was greater than that for the four-hop 
relay network when the traffic per SS was less 
than 768Kbps. The fourhop relay network 
reached its maximum system throughput when 
the traffic per SS was greater than 768Kbps, 
causing its packet loss ratio to rise more rapidly 
than two-hop relay network. 
According to Figure 14, the 802.16j MR 
21 
 
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing 
(OFDM) [38].. 
By setting 1=meanp  Mbit, Figure 17 shows 
the system throughput for our joint routing and 
link-scheduling algorithm as well as the 
compared algorithms. The throughput is 
normalized to an upper bound, and the upper 
bound can be obtained as follows. Due to the 
primary interference, any two links incident to 
the base station can not be scheduled 
simultaneously. Thus the system throughput is 
bounded to the data rate of relay links, i.e., 
18.36  Mbps. From Figure 17, we observe that 
the normalized throughput of our joint routing 
and link-scheduling algorithm (LP & IMS) is 
much better than those compared algorithms 
for all varp  under investigation. Specifically, 
the curves indicate that the normalized 
throughput of Algorithm Cent (with LP) is less 
than about 10% of that of our IMS (with LP). 
They also indicate that our LP-based routing 
provides at least a double of the throughput of 
``Shortest Path" (with IMS). For the joint 
design of routing and link scheduling, Figure 
17 shows that our LP&IMS outperforms HEU 
especially for small varp . As varp  is small, 
another important phenomenon is observed that 
the throughput of our algorithm is very close to 
the theoretical upper bound. 
Note that the derived upper bound could be 
much higher than the optimum solution since 
the bound might not be tight. It is suffice to 
show that the proposed algorithm yields the 
throughput that would be pretty close to the 
optimal solution for most of varp  values under 
investigation. Although our LP&IMS is proven 
to be a 3-approximation algorithm in the worst 
case, the simulation results show that the 
throughput in the average case is much higher 
than that derived in the worst-case analysis. 
As to the effects of varp , we observe that the 
normalized throughput of all algorithms under 
investigation decreases as varp  increases. The 
reason is that as the variance of traffic demand 
of each SS increases, the load of each link is 
difficult to balance. To avoid collision, the 
unbalanced links cannot be scheduled 
simultaneously, and thus the lower spatial reuse 
leads to a lower throughput. However, when 
varp  becomes large, our IMS provides more 
effective link-scheduling capability compared 
to Cent. For example, the normalized 
throughput of Algorithm Cent (with LP) is 
about 90% and 68% of that of our IMS (with 
LP) as 1=varp  and 128 , respectively. 
Furthermore, we observe that the performance 
of HEU is relatively insensitive to varp , and its 
throughput becomes close to that of our 
proposed algorithm for large varp . 
四、 結果與討論/成果自評 
This project focuses on the performance 
optimization for multimedia transmission over 
WiMAX-based WMBNs and WRNs. We first 
proposed an integrated routing and scheduling 
mechanism to provide QoS guarantees to 
real-time services with unrestricted topologies. 
A linear programming optimization was 
devised to solve the amount of non-collision 
bandwidth for a path according to the available 
resource and the interference. Through the 
developed simulation, a series of experiments 
were conducted to indicate that our proposed 
mechanism outperforms the basic mechanism 
with minimal-hop routing and conventional

Fig. 1. The CAT Frame Format
developed to properly perform the assistant selection. Through
the driver updating, our MACAT extension can be added
into the 802.11/802.11e protocol stack, and the existing and
newcome products can be easily upgraded. The performance
of our MACAT protocol is investigated through the NS-
2 simulator, and a series of experiments are conducted to
indicate the capability of MACAT.
II. MEDIUM ACCESS WITH CONTENTION ASSISTANCE
(MACAT)
This section presents our proposed Medium Access with
Contention AssisTance (MACAT) to enhance end-to-end QoS
of real-time services over coexisting IEEE 802.11e and legacy
IEEE 802.11 networks.
The proposed MACAT is an extension of the existing legacy
802.11 DCF MAC and the newcome 802.11e EDCA MAC.
The main concept behind MACAT is that with the aid of
802.11e EDCA QSTAs, legacy 802.11 DCF nQSTAs have
a higher probability to successfully access the channel for
transmitting real-time traffic. QSTAs using MACAT serves
as a contention assistant of nQSTAs, and sends a Contention
AssisTance (CAT) frame for nQSTAs with their better channel
access ability. The successful transmission of the CAT frame
can reserve the channel for nQSTAs which are urgent for
transmitting real-time traffic. With the CAT frame, the QoS of
real-time traffic transferred from nQSTAs can be significantly
improved.
CAT is a newly defined frame extended from the IEEE
802.11 broadcast control frame. The MAC frame format of
CAT is shown in Figure 1. The CAT frame is recognized by
utilizing the reserved SubType value 0000 of Type 01 in the
“Frame Control” field. The “Duration” field is used to set the
NAV of QSTAs receiving this CAT frame. In MACAT, the
NAV value is set to be DIFS+DW (Deferring Window). The
details about NAV setting are discussed in the next subsection.
The “RA” field is set to the broadcast address since the CAT
frame is a broadcast frame. The “TXOP” field is set to the
AC VO TXOP value specified in the IEEE 802.11e standard.
Based on the CAT control frame, the operations of our
MACAT protocol over 802.11e QSTAs and legacy 802.11
nQSTAs are described in the following subsection.
A. The Operations of MACAT
We first describe the operation of the QSTAs which activates
our MACAT. In MACAT, each QSTA operates under the
original IEEE 802.11e EDCA in the normal mode, and enters
the CAT mode at a calculated interval. In the CAT mode,
the QSTA constructs a CAT frame, and sets the transmitting
parameters following the EDCA AC VO contention rules (i.e.,
AIFS =2, CWmin=7, CWmax=15). The QSTA broadcasts the
CAT frame, and then returns to the normal mode. If the
channel is indicated busy before the CAT frame is transmitted,
the QSTA resets the timer according to the standard EDCA
backoff procedure. The QSTA repeats the above procedures
until either successfully transmitting the CAT frame, or giving
up when the retry limit is achieved. On the other hand,
the QSTAs receiving the CAT frame update their NAV to
the “Duration” value of the CAT frame, such that the CAT-
receiving QSTAs will not attempt to contend the channel in
the NAV duration.
The nQSTA using MACAT operates under the legacy IEEE
802.11 DCF in the normal mode. The nQSTA enters the wait-
CAT mode when the real-time data arrives. When receiving
a CAT frame in the wait-CAT mode, the nQSTA enters the
CAT mode and randomly picks a Td (deferring time) value
in DW (Deferring Window), and then starts the transmission
after sensing the medium idle for a Td+DIFS period. On
the other hand, if the channel is indicated busy during the
Td+DIFS period, the nQSTA clears the Td value and transits
to the normal mode. In MACAT, Td is used to avoid packet
collision of simultaneous transmissions from multiple nQSTAs
receiving the CAT frame. Note that the nQSTA receiving the
CAT frame in the normal mode updates its NAV timer as usual.
When the nQSTA starts the transmission after the idle
medium indication for a Td+DIFS period, the TXOP value
in the CAT frame is used to set the maximum limit of CAT
contention free burst (CFB). The CAT CFB begins with the
firstly successful transmission packet from the nQSTA. During
the CAT CFB, the nQSTA is allowed to transmit multiple
MPDUs with an SIFS time gap between the ACK and the
subsequent frame. In a CAT CFB, only the first packet follows
the backoff procedure, which decreases the access delay of
these packets to improve the QoS performance for real-time
applications.

constraints, and use the self-similar traffic to simulate the non-
real-time best-effort application. The VoIP traffic is modeled
by the bursty ON-OFF model that generates VoIP packets only
during ON period [7], [6], [9]. The self-similar traffic with
high variability is generated by many ON-OFF sources, and
the ON-OFF periods follow a Pareto distribution [13].
The talk spurt and silence durations of voice ON-OFF
process are assumed to follow an exponential distribution with
a mean value of 1 sec and 1.35 sec, respectively [10]. During
the period of talk spurt, each source generates 160-byte VoIP
packets with a constant sending rate of 64 kbps. For non-
real-time traffic, the averages ON period of 100ms and OFF
period of 10ms are used in our simulation. The non-real-time
data packet size is fixed to be 1500 bytes, with a sending rate
of 200 kbps.
We use three kinds of sessions in our simulation. The first
kind of sessions is the VoIP traffic model executing on the
EDCA MAC, called EDCA VoIP traffic. The second one is
the VoIP traffic model executing on the DCF MAC, called
DCF VoIP traffic. The last one is the best-effort traffic model
executing on the DCF MAC, called DCF Data traffic.
B. Numerical Results
As for the output metrics, the average bit rate, average end-
to-end delay, and average packet loss rate are used to evaluate
the capability of our MACAT. The metrics are considered
under different lengths of DW and different traffic patterns.
1) Different Lengths of Deferring Window: Firstly, we
investigate the performance of MACAT under different DW
values. There are 45 stations in each QBSS, and every station
in QBSS A has only one session. Among the 45 stations, there
are 15 EDCA VoIP sessions, 15 DCF VoIP sessions, and 15
DCF data sessions. All of these sessions transfers data from
QBSS A to QBSS B. In this experiment, CI is set to 0.75
sec, and the DW value ranges from 0 to 55 time slots.
Figure 4 (a) indicates that when DW values are under 40
time slots, the average bitrate of DCF VoIP sessions using
MACAT is slightly higher than that of original DCF VoIP
sessions. It is due to the higher medium access priority of DCF
VoIP sessions using MACAT. Comparatively, the average bit-
rate of data sessions under our MACAT is lower than that
of the original data sessions. Since the data sessions have
lower QoS requirement, the slightly bit-rate degradation does
not affect the overall system performance. For the EDCA
VoIP sessions using MACAT, due to their better competition
ability (i.e. the smaller backoff windows), the average bit-rate
is hardly affected. Note that MACAT does not perform well
when a large DW is used (i.e. greater than 40). A large DW
value results in more transmission overheads, and thus the
system throughput is decreased.
As shown in Figures 4 (b) and (c), our MACAT has
a significant improvement on average end-to-end delay and
packet loss rate. We also notice that the lowest delay and
packet loss rate are achieved when DW = 19. This result
reveals that a small DW does not necessarily achieve the best

proven to be NP-hard [10]. Then a heuristic algorithm was
developed to ensure efficient, fair, and timely delivery of video
in WiMAX. In [12], a layer-based utility function was defined,
and an adaptive algorithm according to channel condition and
available bandwidth was presented to maximize the total utility
of all users. Although the above works have provided excellent
results for layered-encoded video transmission, their solutions
can not be directly applied to multi-hop networks where
interferences and spatial reuse should be carefully addressed.
For layer-encoded video over multi-hop networks, Shiang and
Schaar proposed a distributed dynamic routing algorithm to
improve the decoded video quality with the consideration of
wireless interferences [3]. However, the multicast issue was
not addressed in this work.
In this paper, we study a radio resource allocation problem
with the consideration of wireless interferences for LMM
over WRNs. The problem is formulated as a multicast tree
problem, and the objective of the problem is to maximize
the system utility where the utility is defined as user satis-
faction. The NP-hardness of the problem is demonstrated,
and then a utility-oriented (UO) resource allocation algorithm
is proposed. The capability of the proposed UO algorithm is
evaluated by a series of experiments, where we have very
encouraging results.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
2 elaborates the problem formulation and presents the problem
hardness. The proposed resource allocation algorithm is shown
in Section 3. Section 4 demonstrates the experimental results
of the proposed algorithm. Finally, this paper is concluded in
Section 5.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND HARDNESS
A. Problem Formulation
This section formally formulates our utility maximization
problem for LMM over WRNs. Our system is based on a static
WRN, and the resource is centrally controlled by a BS which
is connected with a wired layer-encoded multimedia server.
Table I summarizes the notations used in the formulation. A
WRN is modeled as an acyclic directed graph G = (V,E),
where V = {V,S}, and E = {EV , ES} is a set of the wireless
links in the network. The set V = {V1, V2, V3, . . .} represents
all stations including one base station and |V|−1 RSs, and the
set S = {S1, S2, S3, . . .} denotes the set of SSs who subscribe
to our layer-encoded multimedia application. A wireless link
(Vi, Vj) is an element of EV if and only if Vj can receive
multicast data from station Vi. Likewise, link (Vi, Sj) is added
to ES if and only if SS Sj can receive multicasting data from
station Vi. Sj has no out-degree due to the fact that SSs cannot
relay any multicast data to other SSs.
Each station Vi ∈ V can be characterized by a quadruple
(Ci,Di, Ti,Li). Ci (bps) is the maximal capacity within a
transmission frame which Vi can provide with. Di (bps) is the
demand of services other than our layer-encoded multimedia
service. Ti is the proportion of transmission time in a trans-
mission frame, where 0 ≤ Ti ≤ 1. Li ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , MAX} is
the set of layers which station Vi needs to transfer. Each SS
Sj ∈ S is associated with Rj , where Rj ∈ {1, 2, . . . , MAX}
denotes the service quality Sj requests. Each subscriber re-
quests its own class of service quality for an layer-encoded
multimedia application according to the device capability or
SS preference. Moreover, the set of layers Sj received is
denoted as Rj . To conform to the SVC specification, we have
Rj ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , MAX},  ∈ Rj if and only if ( − 1) ∈ Rj ,
 ≥ 2.
Based on G, an undirected interference graph GI =
(V I , EI) is constructed by the node interference model [8]
to indicate wireless interference among the stations, where
V I = V. In the node interference model, if station Vi
transmits data, any station Vj is not transmitting data inside
the interference range of Vi. Then a set of interference links
EV ⊆ EI is obtained, where an interference link [Vi, Vj ] in
EI indicates that Vi and Vj cannot transmit data at the same
time. Furthermore, we assume that [Vi, Vi] ∈ EI ∀ Vi ∈ V I ,
and then for each Vi we have
Ti +
∑
[Vi,Vj ]∈EI
Tj ≤ 1 (1)
To broadcast layer-x data, where x ∈ {1, 2, . . . , MAX}, a
feasible x-layer multicast tree GTx = (V Tx , ETx ) is referred to
as an LMM tree that meets both tree property and bandwidth
constraint. The tree property indicates that 1) link (Vi, Vj) ∈
ETx if and only if x ∈ Li,Lj , and (Vi, Vj) ∈ E and 2) link
(Vi, Sj) ∈ ETx if and only if x ∈ Li, x ≤ Rj and (Vi, Sj) ∈ E.
Taking both interference model and bandwidth constraint
into consideration, each RS Vi cannot exceed its capacity, i.e.,
CiTi −Di −
∑
∈Li
f() ≥ 0 (2)
where f() denotes the amount of traffic needed to transfer
layer  data, and  ∈ {1, 2, . . . , MAX}. From (1) and (2) we
have
Di +
∑
∈Li f()
Ci
+
∑
[Vi,Vj ]∈EI
Dj +
∑
∈Lj f()
Cj
≤ 1 (3)
A set of LMM trees GT = (GT1 , GT2 , . . . , GTMAX ) is defined
as MAX feasible multicast trees such that all RSs satisfy (3).
B. System Utility
We define the system utility Us as overall user satisfaction in
an LMM system. By [2], Us is a weighted sum of application
utility ui of the session of Si. Then we have
Us =
Nm∑
i=1
wiui (4)
where wi = ti∑Nm
s=1
ts
, ti is the session holding time for Si,
Nm is the number of observed multicast users in our layer-
encoded multimedia system. The application utility, denoted
as ui, represents the average utility of the individual session
for Si during its session holding time ti.
As shown in Fig. 2, ti can be divided into k consecutive
segments if session i undergoes k service-level variation,

We denote the session arrivals and departures as “events”.
Assume ε events happened as Nm subscribers are observed,
and let Lr denote the length of the r-th interval between two
events. Let Sr be the set of sessions in the r-th interval, and
i,r is the number of layers Si received in the r-th interval.
The equation (7) can be rewritten as
Us =
1∑Nm
s=1 ts
Nm∑
i=1
k∑
j=1
U(ri,j)ti,j
=
1∑
1≤r≤ε Lr|Sr|
∑
1≤r≤ε
∑
∀i∈Sr
U(i,r)Lr
(8)
Therefore, the maximization of overall system utility Us
indicates that
∑
∀i∈Sr U(i,r) is maximized for any interval
r between two consecutive events by (8).
III. UTILITY-ORIENTED RESOURCE ALLOCATION
ALGORITHM
The proposed utility-oriented (UO) resource allocation al-
gorithm focuses on the deriving of a set of LMM trees GT
with spatial reuse. Accordingly, a multicast path is obtained
for each layer requested by a subscriber. The requirement of
a subscriber can be satisfied by aggregating the layers from
multiple paths. The bandwidth allocation algorithm consists
of two phases, namely 1) tree construction, and 2) tree
adjustment.
In the “tree construction” phase, we slightly modify Di-
jkstra’s algorithm to determine a path from the BS to SSs.
The weights of edges are set to be fixed in most of Dijkstra-
based routing algorithms. In contrast, the proposed algorithm
updates the weights in each iteration to reflect the increased
transmission time due to interferences. Additionally, the pro-
posed algorithm assigns all weights on the nodes instead of
the edges in line 4 of Algorithm 1. These modifications do
not complicate the routing tree construction algorithm.
PG denotes a set of the newly added stations along the
selected path, where PG ⊆ V, and then update the Tj of
Vj interfered with Vi ∈ PG shown in lines 11-17. Since the
base layer has higher significance than enhancement layers and
consumes the fewer resources while providing higher utility
value, bandwidth allocation is done from the base layer.
The occupancy ratio Wi, of the station represents the
allocated bandwidth under the interference consideration. The
weight Wi, for RS Vi to transmit layer  is dynamically
assigned to
Wi, =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
0, if Vi ∈ V T∑
[Vi,Vj ]∈EI
Tj +
f()
Ci
, if Vi /∈ V T
Ω, if Vi /∈ V T ,Wi, > 1
(9)
where Ω is an arbitrary large number. The term Ω tracks
the bottlenecks B that violate (1). Therefore, the modified
Dijkstra’s algorithm will select a path with the smallest sum of
occupancy ratio to boost the balancing degree of the network
loading.
As a newly arriving subscriber might join in the multicast
group or an existing multicast member might depart, tree
topology adjustment is essential to increase overall system
utility. By Theorem 2, LMM achieves maximal overall system
utility if and only if the summation of all utilities is maximized
between two consecutive events. Thus a tree adjustment algo-
rithm is developed to increase the utility values whenever an
event occurs (i.e., the user requests/terminates the service or
moves).
In the tree adjustment algorithm, every RS Vi respectively
maintains a table to dynamically reallocate the resource in
order to maximize the system utility. A table includes an
increment utility value δ and a decrement utility value δˆ
respectively. A value δi, tracks the increment of system utility
if an additional layer  of multimedia stream is supplied
to all the subscribers connected to Vi. Conversely, a value
δˆi, is specified as the decrease value in utility if a layer 
presently served by Vi is forcibly removed. The functions of
δ TABLE ADJUSTMENT and δˆ TABLE ADJUSTMENT
are used for our proposed scheme in Algorithm 2 and respec-
tively executed to update the utility value as (10) and (11).

Fig. 6 shows the impact of arrival rate on stability Sb.
The Sb values of the Greedy scheme are always zero, since
subscribers do not experience any quality degradation or
improvement. Nevertheless, Sb for our UO scheme and Brute
Force increases as arrival rate increases. More arrivals cause
more frequent resource allocation adjustment, which leads
to larger number of changes in quality for a session. The
increment of Sb with increasing λ is smaller in our UO scheme
than in Brute Force, making UO scheme more tolerable than
Brute Force for a layer-encoded multimedia service over
WRNs with higher popularity.

V. CONCLUSION
Supporting layer-encoded multimedia multicast (LMM) ser-
vice over wireless relay networks (WRNs) is still an open
issue in recent years. Although scalable video coding can
be adopted to support heterogeneous subscriber stations with
various QoS requirements, improper distribution of layer-
encoded multimedia content may result in extra resource
consumption and degradation of system performance. This
paper studied an optimization problem of radio resource
allocation for LMM over WRNs. We considered the impact
of wireless interferences and proposed a heuristic algorithm
to maximize the system utility (i.e., overall user satisfaction).
The simulation experiments demonstrated that our proposed
algorithm outperforms the Greedy and Brute Force schemes
in terms of system utility, new-call blocking probability and
stability.

the signal can be sensed but not necessarily recognizable
to the devices in the range. Further define the interfer-
ence range as the range that the device would fail to
detect the received signal if any other devices within
the range transmit signals at the same time. Devices
can tune the receive power to extend the carrier sensing
range. The carrier sensing range is set to be larger than
the interference range to resolve the HDP. However, this
approach decreases the spatial reuse ratio since a lot of
devices outside the interference range of the transmitting
device are forced to be silent unnecessarily. Moreover,
the HDP can not be prevented if there are obstructors
between the devices.
Other than the aforementioned approaches, sev-
eral papers focus on power control to overcome the
HDP [4][11]. Devices use smaller transmission power
which reduces the size of the carrier sensing range and
the interference range. As a result, there is less chance
for the HDP to happen. However, since the transmission
power of IEEE 802.15.4. is already very low, further
decreasing the transmission power makes it difficult to
maintain reliable communication quality. Therefore, this
approach is not applicable to solve the HDP for IEEE
802.15.4.
Some approaches targeting on solving the HDP
for IEEE 802.15.4 have been proposed in the liter-
atures [5][6]. In [5], the devices with hidden-device-
relation are separated into mutually exclusive groups.
Devices in each group can not sense each other. Different
groups are scheduled to transmit in different time inter-
vals to prevent the HDP. However, in sensor networks,
the number of the devices can be very large and the
devices may have moving behaviors. When the network
topology changes, the grouping/scheduling procedures
need to be conducted again. Therefore, the grouping
solution has the drawback of extra energy consumption.
In [6], the receiver tries to detect two specific fields,
frame length and source address, from the corrupted
frame to allocate dedicated time/bandwidth to the corre-
sponding devices to freeze the channel contention from
these devices. However, these two fields cannot be easily
detected from the corrupted frame in the MAC layer
due to the severe frame damage resulted from the signal
collision in the PHY layer. Therefore, the strategy is not
able to completely resolve the HDP.
In this paper, we propose a cross-layer detection and
allocation (CL-DNA) scheme to solve the HDP for IEEE
802.15.4. Upon the occurrence of frame collision, we
propose a specially designed algorithm in the PHY layer
to detect the device addresses from the corrupted frames.
The dubious addresses of the device are then verified
through a MAC procedure in our design. The verified
hidden devices are then scheduled to preserved time
slots for transmissions. Simulation results show that CL-
DNA significantly decreases the chance of the HDP and
substantially improves the system performance of IEEE
802.15.4.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. An
overview of IEEE 802.15.4 is given in Section II. Our
CL-DNA scheme is presented in Section III. The results
of extensive numerical experiments are demonstrated in
Section IV. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section
V.
II. IEEE 802.15.4 OVERVIEW
A. Physical Layer
The physical (PHY) layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 stan-
dard is designed using direct sequence spread spectrum
scheme. IEEE 802.15.4 PHY supports three different
data rates with transmission distance ranging from 10
to 100 meters. In [3], it shows the system diagram
of IEEE 802.15.4. At the transmitter side, data bits
are first divided into groups of four bits. Each four-bit
sequence is then mapped to one of the sixteen possible
symbols and spread to the associated 32-chip sequence.
Note that the spread sequences are pseudo-random and
nearly orthogonal. The chip stream is OQPSK (Offset
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulated with half-
sine pulse-shaping. The modulated signal is transmitted
through wireless channel, and the inverse procedures are
conducted at the receiver side. The received signal is
first demodulated into chips. The 4-bit data symbol is
then recovered from the demodulated chip sequence by
correlate it to the chip sequence associated to each of
the 16 possible symbols in [3] and choose the one with
the highest correlation. Finally, the complete bit stream
is sent to the MAC layer. Another important feature of
IEEE 802.15.4 PHY is the energy detection (ED). ED
is generally used to obtain the received signal strength
at the receiver. If ED detects a large variation of the
received signal strength at the receiver, it is very likely
to have been caused by the overlapped signals from the
occurrence of the HDP.
B. MAC Layer
Two network topologies are supported by IEEE
802.15.4 MAC, the star topology and the peer-to-peer
topology. In the star topology, each mobile device com-
municates with others through a coordinator. In the peer-
to-peer topology, mobile devices directly communicate
with each other. IEEE 802.15.4 MAC specifies two
ways of medium access: the beacon-enabled mode and
the non-beacon-enabled modes. In the beacon-enabled

One flag bit in the ACK frame is used in CL-DNA to
distinguish the NACK from the standard ACK.
To find out who cause the HDP, the coordinator first
tries to detect the preamble locations of the collided
PHY frames in the overlapped signal and then detects
the source address field in the frames using the detected
preamble locations. Recall from section II-C, the pream-
ble sequence of the PHY frame consists of 8 continuous
data symbols 00000000 (decimal). It is located at the
beginning of the PHY frame. The source address field
starts from the 23rd symbol after the end of the preamble
sequence. Therefore, the coordinator constantly corre-
lates the chip sequences of the preamble to the received
signals. Once the peak correlation value is observed,
the coordinator asserts that a preamble sequence is
found. When the preamble is detected, the coordinator
then compares the received signal portion starting from
the 23rd received data symbol right after the detected
preamble, to the chip sequence of each associated source
address in its WPAN. The associated source address with
chip sequence of the highest correlation to the received
signal portion is considered to be the most probable
address of the collided device.
B. Time Allocation Algorithm in the MAC Layer
Once the HDP addresses are detected, the HDP ad-
dress verification procedure is initiated by the MAC
layer. The procedure is necessary since the newly de-
tected HDP addresses may be in error due to the existing
interference and the noise. To verify the detected ad-
dresses, the coordinator schedules each dubious hidden
device (associated with the detected address) to transmit
in the GTS of the following superframe Fig. 1(c)). There
are two possible cases. One is that the dubious device
did receive the NACK frame in the previous superframe.
Under such circumstance, the dubious device just goes
ahead to the transmit frame in GTS. Once the coordinator
receives the frame in GTS, it knows that the detected
address is correct. On the other hand, if the dubious
device did not previously receive the NACK frame, it
indicates that the device was not involved in the HDP of
the previous frame. As a result, the device is forced not to
transmit its frame even through it has been scheduled to
transmit in GTS. If no frame is received in the allocated
GTS, the coordinator concludes that the hidden device
address detected by the PHY layer is not correct. The
correct hidden device addresses are then added to the
HDAL. In order to detect as many existing HDP pairs as
possible, the HDAL is stored and getting appended for
several superframes before it gets reset. Note that the
HDAL reset is necessary since the HDP pair relation
between two devices might diminish over time due to
the device mobility. The duration between each HDAL
pair is defined as a collection period (CP). The length
of CP should be determined by the rate of the topology
variation of the WPAN.
In the beacon following the end of each CP (Fig. 1(d)),
the coordinator allocates the hidden devices in the HDAL
to different sub-periods for transmission to prevent the
HDP (Fig. 1(e)). The HDAL is then reset to start another
around of the HDP recording. Recall that there are three
types of sub-period: CAP, GTS and the inactive period.
The non-hidden devices are allocated in CAP to contend
for transmission. The more serious hidden devices, i.e.
devices that cause the HDP to larger numbers of devices,
are allocated to transmit using GTS to avoid the severe
HDP. The remaining hidden devices are allocated in the
inactive period, using a special backoff period, which is
tripe of UBP, to access the channel. Using a longer back-
off period can decrease the probability of the interference
from other hidden devices and thus obtain better channel
utilization in the inactive period. One should note that
the lengths of the CAP, GTS and the inactive period
should be real-time adjusted according to the number of
hidden device, otherwise there will be a serious fairness
problem between the non-hidden devices and the hidden
devices.
The time allocation algorithm of CL-DNA is per-
formed by exploiting HDALsize and HDsevereness.
HDALsize denotes the number of devices listed in
the HDAL, whereas HDsevereness(i) is the number of
devices that device i can cause the HDP to. Both can
be extracted from the HDAL. In addition, two thresh-
old values, Sizethreshold and Severenessthreshold, are
defined. By comparing HDALsize to Sizethreshold and
HDsevereness(i) to Severenessthreshold, there are four
possible cases.
1) If HDALsize < Sizethreshold and
Max{HDsevereness(i)}< Severenessthreshold,
the coordinator infers that the HDP is not severe.
The coordinator allocates the hidden devices to
transmit in the inactive period. No need to use
GTS in this case.
2) If HDALsize < Sizethreshold and
HDsevereness(i)≥ Severenessthreshold for
some devices, the coordinator concludes that
these hidden devices cause more serious HDP.
Such devices are allocated to transmit using
GTS while the rest of the hidden devices in the
HDAL are allocated to the inactive period for
transmissions.
3) If HDALsize ≥ Sizethreshold and
Max{HDsevereness(i)}< Severenessthreshold,
