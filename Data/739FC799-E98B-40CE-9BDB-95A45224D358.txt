values of these parameters that the 
equation can have first integrals or 
integrating factors. Many methods have 
been proposed to compute the first 
integrals or the integrating factors. One 
can find a list of these methods in [1]. 
Many of the currently used methods 
contain three steps in the framework of 
the calculations. The first step is to 
define a relation which connects the 
integrating factor (or the first integral) to 
some auxiliary variables. The second 
step is to assign an ansatz to these 
auxiliary variables. The third step is to 
insert the ansatz into the governing 
equations of the auxiliary variables and 
look for the coefficients or parameters in 
the ansatz. There is a tradeoff in 
selecting the definitions of the auxiliary 
variables and the form of the ansatz: the 
more complicated the definitions of the 
auxiliary variables and the form of the 
ansatz are the more general results we 
may get but more difficulties we have to 
deal with. For example, when using a 
quasi-polynomial [2, 3], instead of a 
polynomial, as an ansatz one may have 
to pay more efforts in the calculations. 
And it is possible that some ansatz is 
even too complicated to be deal with. 
Under these considerations we introduce 
a new ansatz as well as a new auxiliary 
variable in this report. The new anasatz 
and auxiliary variable discovered in our 
project have a common merit: they are 
more general than some currently used 
ansatz and auxiliary variables while the 
difficulties induced by them in the 
computations are rather mild.  
     The new ansatz employed by us is 
called a ‘restricted quasi-polynomial’ 
ansatz. It is formed by a polynomial of 
the variables x and y with real 
exponents. Therefore we can get more 
information by using a restricted quasi-
polynomial than using a polynomial. 
And more important, the difficulties 
induced are not severe---only simple 
algebric manipulations are required. We 
use a differential equation in a civil 
engineering problem [4] as an example 
to demonstrate this point and show how 
the real exponents as well as the 
coefficients in the restricted quasi-
polynomial are determined without 
difficulty.  
The new auxiliary variable 
discovered in our project is called a 
‘power integrating factor’, which is 
defined as pRU =  with R and p 
denoting respectively an integrating factor 
and a real exponent. The well accepted 
inverse integrating factor [1] is just a 
special case of U with 1−=p . We shall 
see that working with the power 
integrating factor will not get more 
difficulty than working with the inverse 
integrating factor. This is why the power 
integrating factor is useful. This point of 
view will be shown in the example where 
we compute the power integrating factors 
of the quadratic Lotka-Volterra system, 
which had been used in dynamical gas 
mixture, chemistry, ecology, laser physics, 
plasma physics, convective instabilities 
and neural networks [1, 5].

Assuming that all the five terms in (3.8) 
are independent to each other will gives 
us the trivial solution 
01,00,10,0 === ccc . So we proceed to 
consider the possibility of combining 
some of the terms in (3.8). There are 
many cases to be considered but only the 
nontrivial case is presented in this report.  
 
The nontrivial case: 1=α  and 
1=+ βa  (Combination of the 1st and 
the th4 terms) 
In this case equation (3.8) becomes

Assuming that all the four terms above are

the trivial solution 01,00,10,0 === ccc . 
So we proceed to consider the possibility 
of combining some of the terms. We 
found that the 2nd and the 3rd terms in the 
above equation can also be combined 
together by setting 1−=− aa  or 
2/1=a . (So, the value 5.0=a  is 
discovered naturally instead of being 
assumed like that in [4].) Then we get

M =0  (3.16) 
The condition [ ] 01,00,1 ≠Taa  requires 
that this homogeneous sub-system should 
have rank smaller than two. Therefore, the 
three determinants of the 22 ×  
submatrices of M must be zero, i.e., 
02112 =BB , 02112 =BA , 02112 =AB . 
There are three sets of necessary and 
sufficient conditions for the above three 
relations: Case 1) 02112 == BB , Case 2), 
01212 == BA  Case 3) 02121 == BA . 
The power polynomial integrating factors 
obtained in Case 3) are related to those in 
Case 2) by interchanging the positions of 
x and the subscript ‘1’ with those of  y 
and the subscript ‘2’ in (2.1) together with 
(3.12), so only the first two cases are 
considered in detail. Before we continue 
the calculations, we want to propose some 
restrictions to the parameters in P and Q 
as well as the coefficients in (3.13). 
Without making these restrictions we 
might get into too many troublesome 
trivial sub-cases in the course of the 
search of the nontrivial power integrating 
factors. The first restriction is  
01 ≠a   or   02 ≠a .      (3.17a) 
It is proposed to rule out the situation 
where (2.1) together with (3.12) becomes 
a homogeneous system which is a well 
known system solvable by using a scaling 
symmetry. The second restriction is 
01211 ≠bb  or  02221 ≠bb .  (3.17b) 
They are proposed to avoid the situation 
where (2.1) together with (3.12) can be 
solved by a separation of variables. The 
four restriction is 
01,00,1 ≠aa ,              (3.17c) 
which is adopted to prevent our power 
integrating factors to degenerate into a 
function of only one variable (only x or y) 
which can be computed from more 
elementary methods (for example, by 
assuming the integrating factor be a
