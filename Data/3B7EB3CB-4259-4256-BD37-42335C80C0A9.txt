compared with coded PSK. NCPFSK has large Euclidean 
distance and similar bandwidth occupancy as MSK. Numerical 
results show in the sequel that CPM is not necessary worse than 
coded/uncoded QPSK in the nonlinear channels, and sometimes 
CPM signals are better.  
In section 2, GMSK and NCPFSK signals are introduced. In 
section 3, characteristics of modulated signals through nonlinear 
power amplifier are considered. Then, the system models for the 
transmission of the PSK and the CPM schemes are presented in 
section 4. In section 5, the special conditions for a fair 
comparison are outlined, concerning the definitions of power and 
bandwidth-efficiency. Based on this comparison the results of 
extensive simulations are presented and finally conclusion and 
discussion are given in section 6.

distance 2min 3.0d = , is shown in figure 1, where the set of four 
phase states { }23,,2,0 πππ  are assigned to nodes of the trellis. 
At each nodes, there are two output branches related to 
1=nα and 1−=nα  respectively. The modulation indexes related 
to each node and branch are listed in table 1, where 1h related to 
input data 1+  and 2h to input data 1− . This ensures the 
condition 0.5avgh = .  
Comparing to MSK signals, the above realization of 
nonlinear CPFSK signals has coding gains 1.761dB over MSK 
signals.

linear receiver [1]. For the binary four-state NCPFSK scheme the 
receiver applied the Viterbi algorithm. Due to its inherent trellis 
code this scheme promises 2.2 dB asymptotic gains over QPSK. 
For reference, MSK is also included for comparison.

Simulation Results 
 
A fair comparison scheme for all types of modulations is 
given in [7] where the power and bandwidth constrains of a real 
system are defined below: Bandwidth-efficiency is in 
conjunction with adjacent channel interference in terms of the 
used channel spacing fΔ  normalized to the information bit-
rate T/1 , independent of whatever kind of modulation scheme 
and filter is used. A measure of the power-efficiency is defined as 
the required optimal backoff for the envelope-varying schemes as 
well as for the possible saturated operating of the constant-
envelope schemes. As a reference we choose a QPSK scheme 
without ACI and nonlinear HPA for comparison ( QPSK f ∞=Δ ). 
This scheme requires NEb 0  =8.4 dB for a BER of 10 4−=Pb . 
The effective degradation of the system under test is now 
the degradation in NEb 0  to QPSK f ∞=Δ  plus the output backoff 
in dB. All values are taken at a BER of 10 4−=Pb . The backoff 
had to be separately optimized for the QPSK schemes for each 
value of channel spacing Tf b⋅Δ , resulting in a tradeoff between 
maximizing output power on the one side and avoiding nonlinear 
distortions and additional ACI on the other side. The 
optimization procedure is illustrated in figure 5 for QPSK. In this 
example we have examined the performance of QPSK with a 
normalized channel spacing of 75.0=⋅Δ Tf b  and square root 
filter with %50  rolloff. The BER in figure 5 is drawn as a 
function of the HPA input power. The parameter varied for the 
different curves is ratio of the equivalent received noise power 
N j after the receiving filter to the output power of the HPA. This 
is effectively the same as varying N 0 . Going along one of the 
lower curves, we see that at a certain input power the BER 
reaches a minimum.

Figure 5 BER of QPSK with adjacent channel interference and 
nonlinear distortions versus relative TWT input power 
 
On the left side of this point noise is the dominating disturbance; 
while on the right side nonlinearity and ACI cause the main 
degradations. In this example the optimal operating point for a 
BER of 10 4−=Pb  is reached for an input power dB2−=S in . 
Now, taking all values on the vertical line for this operating point 
and the corresponding output power S out , we can compare the 
theoretical BER of QPSK with the above example and find out 
the degradation for ACI with bf TΔ ⋅ =075 [9]. The effective 
degradation, D , as described above, is the sum of the 
degradation in 0b NE  (here: 1.4dB) and the “lost” power due to 
output backoff (here: 0.4OBO = dB for inS = -2dB ), see figure 
2. A final effective degradation to the reference system 
with dBD 8.1=  is obtained. The same procedure has been 
repeated for different values of the normalized channel spacing 
bf TΔ ⋅ and for all he above mentioned non-constant envelope 
schemes. 
As for CPM, the schemes are always assumed to operate 
with 0OBO = dB, therefore only the channel spacing bf TΔ ⋅  
had to be varied. The simulated results are shown in Figure 6 for 
the NCPFSK scheme for different values of bf TΔ ⋅ .
