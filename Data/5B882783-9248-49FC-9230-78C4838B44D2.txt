Abstract 
 
This project collected 8463 three-dimensional body scanned models to investigate the sizing 
category strategy, for constructing the templates of digital human model (DHM). Results reported 
the body mass index and 10-ages interval could be the better strategy to category the human body 
size. On the other head, this project also proposed the strategies of defining the landmarks, joint 
centers and skeleton system, and the verification of these methods has been done. In summary, this 
project presented the strategies to category the sizing of scanned models and to change the postures 
of these static data. These results can receive a wide application in product design, such as car 
design; operate design; and working place design.

are widely used in clinical gait analysis. Therefore, we investigated whether these more recent 
regression equations are suitable for application to DHM, and proposed a novel approach to 
determine the HJC based on 3D surface anthropometry. We also sought to determine the errors 
inherent when locating the HJC manually.  
2. METHODS 
2.1 Sizing category 
This research collected 8463 digital human body models from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 
Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. To capture the intricacies of the human body in one pass, the Chang Gung 
Whole-Body Scanner (CGWBS, Fig. 1) uses four scanning instruments mounted on three vertical 
towers. Each tower has a linear ball-bearing rail and servo motor assembly that moves the scanning 
instrument vertically. After the body scanning process, researchers collects the 22 human body 
dimensions, including circumference, width, area and volume to build up the digital human 
database, the dimensions including distance, girth, circumference, volume, surface area, body mass 
index(BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), waist-hip area ratio (WHaR), weight and height. 
According the reference review result, this study categories the human body size by the BMI and 
WHR indexes. First, we test the correlation between 22 body dimensions and two body indies. It 
also use the cluster analysis method to category human body size into 28 standard human models 
for both genders by the different age interval from age 21 to age 90, including age all, age 5-years, 
age 10-years and age-generation. Using correlation analysis to find out the best body index strategy 
and analyze the term mean absolute differences (MAD) to indicate the error between the 
measurements of the different standard sample subjects from the 22 human body dimensions, the 
MAD mean that the difference between the standard samples. And divide into five categories, 
including circumference(C), width (W), profile area (P-A), volume (V) and surface area(S-A) with 
the standard human models from the cluster analysis, the MAD calculation. Then we compare the 
total difference from the 28 standard human models by the different strategies. To compare the 
mean difference and find out the better strategy to category the human body size with the body 
index and age interval.

The locations of HJC derived from motion analysis were subtracted from the results estimated 
using each of the two equations. The resulting linear difference scores were analyzed using 
nonparametric 2-related Wilcoxon (SPSS v.10.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL. USA). The differences of 
three anatomical axes are also calculated. The absolute distance along each axis was compared to 
determine the accuracy of each equation in the three anatomical planes using nonparametric 
2-related Wilcoxon (SPSS v.10.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL. USA). The signed distance error was 
compared to determine the general direction of the error using Chi-Square tests. The significance 
level was set at P<0.05. 
3. RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
3.1 Sizing category 
The result shows that BMI could be the better body index strategy to category the human body size 
than the WHR index. BMI has the higher correlation with the 22 body dimensions than WHR in 
both genders, and both genders also have the similar trend for the two body indexes. Most

To compare the indexes, weight and BMI, BMI, often referred to as the Quetelet Index, utilizes a 
person’s height and weight to gauge the total body fat in adults; it is an indicator of optimal weight 
for health and different from lean mass or percent body fat calculations because it only considers 
height and weight. The BMI is a well established measure in the medical community; this is 
observed by a cursory review of the available literature (Feitosa et al., 2002). We have given 
interpretations to the first five components-some of them provide quantitative evidence to the 
empirical anthropometric observations (Sheldon, 1940).

Abstract. Deforming 3D scanned data is an important and necessary procedure 
for the development of dynamic three-dimensional (3D) scanned 
anthropometry. The inaccuracies in joint center will cause error in deformation. 
Bell et al. developed the equations to predict hip joint center (HJC) based on 
anthropometric measurement of inter-anterior superior iliac spine distance 
(IAD). However, no previous study has reported on the reliability of IAD 
measurements in 3D scanned data, and therefore the effect on HJC estimates 
needs to be determined. Four measurers (2 trained/ 2 untrained) were recruited 
into this study to collect measurements of IAD in 3D scanned data under two 
situations (with/ without landmarks). The intra-class correlation (ICC) and 
technical error of measurement (TEM) were used to assess the reliability of the 
measurements. Results showed the untrained group had the lowest reliability 
and validity of IAD measurement in the without landmarks situation, and the 
error of HJC prediction in this situation was significantly higher than in the 
other situations (p＜0.001). Both of training and use of landmarks improved the 
validity of measurement and HJC prediction; compared with training alone, 
attaching landmarks can significantly improve the reliability of measurement.

1   Introduction 
With the general application requirements of the dynamic three-dimensional (3D) 
scanning data, an accurate and reliable method to deform this data needs to be 
defined. The accurate identification of joint centers is of great importance for 3D 
scanning data deformation. Studies have shown that inaccuracies in identifying joint 
center will cause joint translations, and have a considerable influence on body 
kinematics and kinetics [1-2]. The hip, knee, and ankle joint are used to define the 
anatomical frame of the lower extremities [3]. While the joint centers of the knee and 
 The Effects of Landmarks and Training on 3D Surface Anthropometric Reliability 5 
Twenty subjects (9 male, 11 female), with a mean (SD) age of 21.4 (0.7) years, 
weight of 56.8 (9.37) kg, and height of 166.1 (1.7) cm were recruited into this study. 
The subjects had no history of lower limb problems, and gave informed consent to 
participate in this study, which was approved by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital 
Institutional Review Board (no: 97-2538B). The subjects, wearing a standard garment 
and cap, stood erect with their shoulder held in 20° to 30° of abduction and feet 
shoulder-width apart. During scanning, the subjects had to hold their breath for about 
10 s. All procedures and parameters were in accordance with the previous study [11].  
Each subject completed two trials of scanning. The relevant anatomical landmarks 
of the right and left antero-superior iliac spine (ASIS) were marked in the first trial by 
a trained researcher. The line distance of IAD in eight of subjects was measured by 
the trained researchers (used Martin-type anthropometer), after scanning.  
2.2   Data Collection from Scanned Data 
Four measurers were recruited for this study. Two were familiar with human anatomy 
(trained measurers); the other two had not received any trained in human anatomy 
(untrained measurers). Following a simple introduction to the human anatomy and the 
location of the ASISs through three pictures from anatomy textbooks [12], the 
measurers were asked to locate the coordinates of the right and left ASISs (x, y, z) on 
the scan images in two trials. Software will calculate the line distance of IAD form 
the right and left ASISs coordinates and the test-retest reliability of IAD measurement 
will be calculated. Anthro3D software (Logistic Technology, Taiwan) was used to 
perform these location tasks on 3D scanning data (Fig. 1) and to calculate the line 
distance of IAD. The x axis was defined as the anterior-posterior direction, the y axis 
was defined as the medial-lateral direction, and the z axis was defined as the superior-
inferior direction. The coordinates of HJC (x, y, z) were calculated using the 
equations presented by Bell et al. [4]. When the coordinate system origin was located 
halfway between the right and left ASISs, the equation estimated HJC at 22% IAD 
posterior, 30% IAD inferior, and 36% IAD lateral to the point of origin.

the coordinates of the right ASIS (point Y) and left ASIS (point Y’) are located on the scan 
images with landmarks, the software will calculate the IAD (line YY’). 
 The Effects of Landmarks and Training on 3D Surface Anthropometric Reliability 7 
intra-measurer and inter-measurer TEMs (16.8 mm and 13.2 mm), and NLT has the 
second highest (11.8 mm and 7.1 mm). LT shows the least intra-measurer and inter-
measurer TEMs (2.3 mm and 2.1 mm); it is interesting to note the Duncan's post hoc 
test showed no significant difference between LNT and LT.

Fig. 2. The intra-measurer and inter-measurer ICCs of IAD measurement (n=20) 
The inter-measurer ICCs were higher than the intra-measurer ICCs (Fig. 2). All 
groups have good reliability (ICC>0.75), except the intra-measurer ICC of the NLNT. 
The NLNT showed the lowest inter-measurer and intra-measurer ICCs in the four 
groups. The groups that measured with landmarks (LNT and LT) showed excellent 
reliability (ICC>0.9).  
3.2   Validity of IAD Measurement 
The mean value obtained from NLNT showed the most discrepancy with the 
traditional measurement (25.2±15.1 mm). Duncan's post hoc test showed the result of 
NLNT was significantly greater than the other groups (NLT: 10.2±7.2 mm; LNT: 
7.9±4.5 mm; LT: 7.7±3.8 mm). 
 The Effects of Landmarks and Training on 3D Surface Anthropometric Reliability 9 
ICCs > 0.9. Compared with training, attaching landmarks significantly increased the 
reliability of measurement. These results demonstrated that landmarks can play a more 
important role than the training in improving reliability. 
4.2   The Effect of Trained and Landmark on the Validity of IAD Measurement 
ISO 20685:2010 describes the 3D scanning methodology used to establish internationally 
compatible anthropometric databases. In this methodology, the measurers should be skill 
anthropometrists, and landmarks are tools for improving the accuracy of measurement.  
Our study compared the four groups (NLNT/ NLT/ LNT/ LT) and found except for 
NLNT, the results of NLT/LNT/ LT are similar. The results showed the landmarks 
were the only assistive tools to improve the measurement accuracy for the trained 
measurers; however, when the measurers have not received training in anatomy, the 
landmarks were important to the correctness of the measurement. 
Location of the ASIS by the trained measurers with landmarks is considered the 
best methods to improve the reliability and the validity of the measurement (ISO 
20685:2010). However, our study still found about 7 mm mean measurement 
difference in the LT group. The errors can be explained by an additional source of 
error related to the placement of the landmarks during the identification of ASIS 
locations. Small variances in landmarks placement can therefore affect measurement 
results significantly [16]. Pervious study also reported a maximum measurement 
difference of 30 mm when waist circumference was measured at four different, yet 
closely located points [18]. 
4.3   The Effect of Trained and Landmark on the Validity of HJC Prediction 
Our study compared four groups (NLNT/ NLT/ LNT/ LT) and found the results of 
three groups (NLT/LNT/ LT) are similar. The results of reliability and validity of IAD 
measurement are also similar, showing the predicted HJC coordinates were affected 
by the measurement differences of IAD. 
The NLNT shows a large difference compared with the other groups, with a 
maximum error in the y axis of 20.9 mm. These results show that measurement 
obtained by untrained measurers have low validity in HJC prediction when no 
landmarks are used. Since most of the staff engaged in 3D scanning image 
deformation has little chance to receive anatomical training, there is a need to solve 
the reliability and validity problem in IAD measurement on 3D scanning data. 
Moreover, our results showed that trained measurers also needed landmarks to 
improve measurement reliability. This indicates that to improve the correctness of 
IAD measurement and decrease the HJC prediction errors, attaching landmarks on 
ASISs is a better solution than giving training. 
5   Conclusion 
This study successfully quantified the magnitude and reliability of intra- and inter-
measurer anthropometric measurements, and showed the effect that measurement 
differences have on predicted HJC locations. Results showed the predicted HJC
