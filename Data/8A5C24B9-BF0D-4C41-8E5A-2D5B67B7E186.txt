2methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor are the most
promising structures. Notably, power conversion
efﬁciencies of organic photovoltaic cels based on 
P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunctions close to 5.0%
have successfully been demonstrated [1, 2]. Blend
nanoscale morphology [3] as well as stability of
organic solar cell [4] are the currently subjects of
intense research. For example, an optimization
parameter, i.e., the weight ratio of blend P3HT as
donor and PCBM as acceptor could be to increase the
numbers of donor/acceptor interfaces and advance to
achieve the high-exciton dissociation efficiency [5].
However, charges after dissociation, i.e., hoels and
electrodes, have to be collected at the cathode and
anode electrodes through percolation pathways in the
hole and electron transporting phases and the
efﬁciency of the blend can be limited by charge 
recombinations at the interfaces of these phases [6].
The blend thin ﬁlm properties of the organic solar
cells are substantialy inﬂuenced by interference 
effects that contribute to the electric and optical
modulation inside the device. Numerical software has
developed to allow the computation of the electric
and optical effects in the depth of organic multi-layer
structures under a standard AM1.5 distribution. Many
works on thicknesses optimization based on optical
modeling has been successfully developed [7, 8] to
analyzed and modify the light absorption inside the
photoactive layers. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult tobe
used to enhance the power conversion efﬁciency 
experimentally because the charges collection
efﬁciency may decrease with the increasing optical
absorption [9]. Therefore, the optical and electrical
effects were to be analytically modeled and needed to
be taken into account to consider simultaneously in
the numerical calculations. The characteristic
simulation of organic solar cells has recently been
reported by several research groups. However, the
highly disordered structure of BHJs makes it difficult
to characterize model parameters. In order to improve
the performance of the polymer solar cells, an
analysis modeling as accurate as possible is necessary
to guide the optimum technological approaches.
Therefore the typical approach is to estimate the
parameter values experimentally and resort to
numerical simulations to properly interpret the
measurement results.
In this work, we will focus on studying the
nanostructured morphology of the blend P3HT and
PCBM thickness and correlated with the organic
solar cells’ performances. Certainly, the
characterization of solar cells such as open-circuit
voltage, short-circuit current, quantum efficiency, fill
factor and conversion efficiency will be numerically
investigated to understand the fundamental
mechanism. Eventually, we use the numerical
optimum design to fabricate the flexible organic solar
cells. Moreover, the proposed OSCs were
experimentally measured not only to advance to
evaluate the performance of the proposed polymer
solar cells, but also to verify the feasibility of
numerical modeling.
2. Mathematical and Numerical Model
For the structure of organic solar cells, the
currently most promising device is the BHJ OSCs
depicted in Fig. 1. When illuminated, electrons in the
Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) in the
polymer are promoted to the Lowest Unoccupied
Molecular Orbital (LUMO), thus forming the
electron–hole pairs (EHPs), which referred to as
excitons. The diffusion length of a moving exciton in
commonly used polymeric materials is an order of a
few nanometers. An exciton has a non-negligible
chance of eventually reaching the polymer/acceptor
interface only if it was photogenerated within a
distance. In case this occurs, the built-in potential
drop produced between the two materials is strong
enough to stretch the exciton driving the electron and
hole to a distance thus reducing the strength of their
Coulomb attraction. This less tightly bound
electron–hole pair is referred as a geminate pair.
When the energy of the bond is low enough that it
can be overcome by the electric ﬁeld induced by a 
small voltage difference applied at the contacts. The
newly separated electron and hole migrate, driven by
electric ﬁeld drift and difusion forces, to the anode 
and cathode, respectively, here they are harvested
thus producing a net current.
Figure 1. Working principle of bulk heterojunction
organic solar cells.
The governing equations are discussed below to
simplify and analyze the bulk microscopic properties
of the polymer. The electric field (E) is modified by
the photon induced charge densities for holes, p(x),
and electrons, n(x), must be calculated to satisfy the
potential difference (Φ) across the electrodes. Poisson
equation can be yielded to the relation of the electric
filed, the potential, and the charges and is expressed
43. Results and Discussion
3.1 Numerical Evaluations
The numerical simulation is used to investigate
the photo-electric interactive effect as well as to
advance to design the optimum geometry of organic
solar cells. Here, the bulk heterojunction solar cells
were assumed as the structure of
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al. The schematic
diagram of the proposed solar cells structure and
corresponding energy band is shown in Fig. 2.[10]
Optical constants (n, k) of the blend P3HT and
PCBM layer referred to Ref. [11] and used as
input condition into the numerical software. Hole
mobility in P3HT and electron mobility in PCBM,
are respectively, 2 × 10–8 and 3 ×10–7 m2/Vs at 300 K
[12]. Numerical characteristic related to the varying
thickness of the blend PCMB:P3HT layer were
studied in detail. These results could allow us to
address important design parameters concerning BHJ
operation.
Figure 2 (a) Structural layers and (b) energy band of
the organic solar cells. [10]
3.1.1 Numerical Verifications
Theoretically, energy band is calculated as the
difference of energies between the donor highest
occupied molecular orbital, EHOMO, and the acceptor
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, ELUMO. We
should obtain Voc=Eg/q, where Eg =EHOMO－ELUMO,
which can be interpreted as the effective (electrical)
band gap of the blend. Therefore, characteristic
parameter of VOC is slightly affected by the blend
thickness. In order to investigate the variation of
short-circuit current density as a function of blend
thickness, we focus to realize and characterize for the
blend thickness. The cell structure is assumed as ITO
(180 nm)/PEDOT (45 nm)/P3HT:PCBM/Al(100 nm).
Blend thicknesses are varied between 30 and 250 nm.
The comparison of the numerical calculation and
experimental measurements [11, 13] are plotted in
Fig. 3. The experimental short-circuit current reaches
its maximum value for a blend thickness of about 70
nm, followed by a little decrease and then increase
for thickness higher than 120 nm [11] or a little
decrease larger till a 140 nm blend thickness [13] and
We note a little deviation between simulated and
experimental data for blend thicknesses higher than
180 nm. This deviation could be attributed to the
thickness dependence of optical constants (n, k).
Complementary studies of optical constants on a
larger blend thickness range seem to be necessary.
Moreover, this simulation indicates that carriers are
collected at their respective electrodes without losses.
Indeed, it has been widely demonstrated that bulk
heterojunction morphologies strongly depend on
preparation conditions, e.g. the purity of the material
as well as thermal treatment.
3.1.2 Optimum Calculation
The energy gap of the blend P3HT and PCBM is
approximately 1.5~1.8eV. The longest absorption
wavelength should be around 650 nm, as fig 4
indicates. Hence, organic polymers exhibited the
narrow absorption efficiency than the inorgnanic
semiconductors. Figure 4 demonstrated the
absorption efficiency of organic solar cells
corresponding to the varying blend thickness. As Fig
4 shows, two absorption peaks located around 350nm
and 500nm. The numerical results revealed that the
absorption efficiency raises with the increasing blend
thickness for the short wavelength. Contrarily, the
absorption at long wavelength region of the material
increases with the increasing blend thickness. In
principle, shorter wavelength, i.e., near UV part, is
absorbed the surface of organic solar cells. But, the
longer wavelength, i.e., green light part, is necessary
to be completely absorbed at the thicker thickness.

simulations and experimental data.

6Next, we assumed the OSCs structure as ITO
(180nm)/PEDOT:PSS (varying)/blend P3HT:PCBM
(75nm)/Al (100nm). The thickness effect of hole
transfer layer, i.e., PEDOT:PSS layer, is also studied
in this article for the device performance. Figure 7
presents the characteristics parameters of (a)VOC,
(b)JSC, (c)FF, and (d) ηare corresponding to the
varying PEDOT:PSS thickness. Figure 6 displayed
that the characteristics of the above-mentioned
parameters do not apparently change for the varying
thickness ranged from 10 nm to 100 nm. Therefore,
the PEDOT:PSS could not affect the characteristics
of organic solar cells. As before studied, the purpose
of PEDOT:PSS film is whether to enhance the holes
transfer to anode or to smoothen the ITO film .

3.1.3 Characteristic of Optimum Design
According to the numerical simulations as
described as before, the optimum numerical design is
set to be ITO(180nm)/PEDOT:PSS(60nm)/blend
P3HT:PCBM(75nm)/Al(100nm). Figure 8 exhibits
absorption efficiency, EQE efficiency and I-V curve
characteristic of organic solar cells for the optimum
numerical design. In Fig. 8a plotted the absorption
efficiency of each layer. The light absorption
exhibited is less than 0.1 at the range of 350~650 nm
except for the P3HT:PCBM layer. The absorption
peaks of the blend P3HT and PCBM located at 350,
450, and 550 nm, respectively, corresponding to the
values of 0.9, 0.85, and 0.9. In Fig. 8b the external
quantum efficiency curve is also presented. The
quantum efficiency of photo-generated carriers is
given by the ratio between the number of electrons
produced in the outer circuit and that of incident
photons. Based on the numerical results, the values of
EQE peak are 0.58 and 0.85, corresponding to locate
around 360 nm as well as 560 nm, respectively. As
above-mentioned, morphology of P3HT:PCBM layer
has a drastic effect on the quantum efficiency of the
device. Film morphology and as a result quantum
efficiency was improved by the blend P3HT:PCBM
layer of solar cells. In Fig. 8c, the I–V characteristics
of the proposed device is presented. The composite
layer shows short circuit current density (Jsc),
open-circuit voltage (Voc), 10.60 mA/cm2, 0.55 V.
Also, ﬁll factor (FF) and conversion efficiency are
calculated as 32% and 2.96% respectively.

5. Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated a numerical
computation to taking into account optical and
electric effect. The numerical skill could allow us to
predict the characteristic investigation of bulk
heterojunction organic solar cells. The numerical
results revealed that the characteristics strongly
depended on the P3HT:PCBM blend thickness. It was
found that the optimum design of HBJ OSCs was
calculated as the thickness of
ITO(180nm)/PEDOT:PSS(60nm)/P3HT:PCBM(75n
m)/Al(100nm). The characteristic parameters of VOC,
Jsc, FF, and ηare 0.55 V, 10.60 mAcm-2, 0.51, and
2.96%, respectively. Besides, the simulation will help
understand the physical models and the principal
effects of device specific parameters, as simulation
variables for the materials and their impact on the
results can be illustrated. The ability to accurately
simulate the electrical and optical properties of solar
cells based on organic semiconducting materials will
aid in the design process. Finally, we used the
numerically optimum design to fabricate the flexible
OSCs. The performances of VOC, Jsc, FF, and ηare
achieved as 0.35 V, 6.90 mA/cm2, 0.28, and 0.68%,
respectively.
