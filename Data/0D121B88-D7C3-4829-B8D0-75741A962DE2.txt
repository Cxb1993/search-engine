1. Introduction 
In the green-energy era, energy saving is 
one of the main themes of study for 
researchers and engineers in many disciplines. 
To better achieve this goal, electronic devices 
tend to be designed to operate at lower 
voltages. However, electronic devices 
operating at lower voltages are more 
vulnerable to interference from noises than at 
higher voltages, and hence specifications in 
noise immunity for most electronic devices 
nowadays are more stringent than ever before. 
Balance circuits (also known as differential 
circuits), in comparison with their single- 
ended counterparts, provide the advantage of 
smaller noise coupling with nearby devices [1]. 
This is one of the reasons why balanced 
topology is widely adopted in integrated- 
circuit (IC) design.  
In a wireless-communication system, 
BPFs play a very important role. If the 
surrounding blocks are of balanced type, the 
BPFs in the frontend of an RF system must be 
also implemented in balanced configuration. 
In the past few years, balanced BPFs have 
received increasing attention [2-12]. These 
balanced BPFs have been constructed using 
coupled-line structures [2], [3], branch-line 
structures [4], [5] (For designing wideband 
and ultra-wideband BPFs), and, for the most 
part, multi-section resonators [6−12]. For a 
balanced BPF to be competent, not only 
should its DM operations meet passband 
specifications, but its CM transmission must 
also be appropriately suppressed for the 
frequency range of interest. Hence, the design 
of a balanced BPF appears to be more 
challenging than that of a single-ended one. 
In this project, we proposed several new 
dual-band and tri-band balanced BPFs which 
are designed using coupled two- or three- 
section λ/4 and λ/2 SIRs and/or SIRRs. By 
careful design of the DM and CM half circuits, 
good DM passband performance and high CM 
rejection were achieved. The obtained results 
will be presented in the following sections. 
2. Objective of This Project 
This project devotes to the study and 
development of dual-band and tri-band 
balanced BPFs which are intended for 
applications in 1.57 GPS systems, WLAN 
systems complying with IEEE 802.11 FH, 
802.11g, 802.11b, and IEEE 802.11a 
specifications, and WiMax systems. The 
principles behind two-section coupled lines 
and coupled resonator are studied with 
formulas for application derived. The 
proposed dual-band and tri-band balanced 
BPFs are designed and verified by measured 
results.  
3. Research Methodology 
In this project, dual-band and tri-band 
balanced BPFs are designed using two-section 
coupled SIRs and TSSIRs. The design 
methodology for the balanced dual-band and 
tri-band BPFs is similar to that of single-ended 
ones. Namely, for given passband center 
frequencies and bandwidths, the lowpass 
prototype filter parameters (g-parameters) and 
the related BW-g-parameter formulas are used 
to find the external quality factor of 
input/output SIRs and coupling coefficients 
for internal SIRs. However, the challenge of 
such balanced multi-band BPF designs is the 
suppression of common modes. In this project, 
the method of separating the resonant 
frequencies of the common modes of the 
 4 
the λ/2 SIRs along the POS is virtually 
grounded. This makes the coupled-line section 
behave as a bandpass unit [9]. On the other 
hand, as the BPF is in CM operation, the POS 
can be replaced with a magnetic wall, and 
each of the λ/2 SIRs is effectively bisected 
with an open end at the Z2 section. The 
coupled-line section thus now works as an 
all-stop structure [13]. The equivalent DM and 
CM half circuits of the BPF are, respectively, 
shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b). It is the 
all-stop characteristic of Fig. 2(b) that allows 
the designed balanced BPF to achieve a good 
CM performance.  
In this design, the proposed balanced 
dual-band BPF is to be operated in the 
2.4-GHz (2.4−2.484 GHz) and 5.2-GHz 
(5.15−5.35 GHz) WLAN bands and to be 
designed on a 0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 
6010 substrate with a dielectric constant of 
10.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0023. A technique 
based on coupling coefficient and external 
quality factor is employed for this filter design. 
By this approach, the gap width and the 
coupling length between the coupled SIRs are 
determined based on the required coupling 
coefficients, and the tap positions of the 
input/output λ/2 SIRs are designed according 
to the desired external quality factor [10]. The 
first step in this filter design is to determine 
the dimensions of Z1 and Z2 sections of the 
SIRs. By assuming equal electric length for 
these two sections (namely, θ1 = θ2 = θ0), the 
impedance ratio Rz (denoted by Rz = Z1/ Z2) 
calculated by using 1 3 1tan (1 )zR f fπ− = +  
is 2.54 [14]. The electric length at the center 
frequency of the first passband (namely, 2.45 
GHz) computed by using 10 tan zRθ −=  is 
57.89o. Considering fabrication precision limit, 
the widths of Z1 and Z2 sections are set to 0.25 
and 1.75 mm, respectively, which are 
equivalently 66.32 and 26.16 Ω  in 
characteristic impedance.  
With the dimensions of the λ/2 (λ/4) SIRs 
known, we can proceed to determine the 
widths and lengths of the coupling gaps 
between the coupled SIRs as well as the 
input/output tap positions. For this design, the 
fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of both 
passbands are initially set to be 5%, which, to 
be on the safe side, is a bit larger than the 
actually needed ones (namely, 3.4% and 3.8%, 
respectively, for the first and the second 
passbands of the proposed balanced BPF). 
Meanwhile, we use a fourth-order Butterworth 
function as the target BPF response. The 
required external quality factor ddeQ  of the λ/2 
SIRs at the two passband center frequencies 
can be calculated to be 15.31. The coupling 
coefficients between the SIRs can be found to 
be 12ddM  = 21ddM  = 0.057and 22ddM  = 0.027 [6], 
where 12ddM  ( 21ddM ) stands for the coupling 
coefficient between SIR (1) (the λ/2 SIR) and 
SIR (2) (the λ/4 SIR) and 22ddM  the one 
between SIRs (2) (the two λ/4 SIRs). Once the 
external quality factor and the coupling 
coefficients are known, the gap width and the 
coupling length between the coupled SIRs as 
well as the tap positions of the input/output 
λ/2 SIRs can be determined by parametric 
studies through simulation.  
A prototype circuit of the proposed 
balanced dual-band BPF shown in Fig. 1 was 
fabricated and measured to verify its 
performance. Structural parameters obtained 
by simulation are L1 = 1.775, L2 = 3.882, L3 = 
1.207, L4 = 1.125, L5 = 1, L6 = 3.15, L7 = 1.235, 
L8 = 0.677, L9 = 7.425, L10 = 7.025, W1 = 0.25, 
W2 = 1.75, W3 = 0.54, G1 = 0.6, G2 = 0.24, D = 
0.4, and t = 1.975, with all units in millimeter. 
Fig. 3 shows the simulated and measured S 
parameters against frequency. For the DM 
response presented in Fig. 3(a), the measured 
(simulated) first and second passbands are 
centered at 2.45 (2.455) GHz and 5.27 (5.26) 
GHz, respectively, with a 3-dB bandwidth 
ranging from 2.4 to 2.5 (2.4 to 2.51) GHz and 
5.15 to 5.39 (5.13 to 5.39) GHz. The measured 
(simulated) minimum insertion loss are 
respectively, 2.2 (1.81) and 2.56 (2.43) dB for 
the first and second passbands. The measured 
amplitude imbalance ( 21 2 1S S ′− ) (phase 
imbalance ( '21 21S S∠ −∠ )) for the first band is 
between 0.06 and 1.39 dB 
 6 
horizontal microstrip lines are brought closer 
to establish the source-load coupling. The 
resulting additional signal transmission path 
can help create transmission zeros near the 
edges of the two desired DM passbands. 
For demonstration, the balanced dual-band 
BPF is designed for use in the popular 
2.4-GHz (2.4−2.484 GHz) and 5.2-GHz 
(5.15−5.35 GHz) WLAN bands and is 
fabricated on an RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. In 
Fig. 5, let the microstrip of from positions D to 
A and then to B be referred to as a λ/2 SIR. In 
this λ/2 SIR, let the characteristic impedance 
of the center microstrip section (i.e., the 
section covering position A) be denoted by Z1, 
and that of the two end sections (i.e., the 
sections associated with positions D and B), Z2. 
In addition, the section with Z1 in the λ/2 SIR 
has an electric length of 12 ,θ  and each of the 
sections with Z2, 2.θ  To make the design 
easier, we proceed with the assumption that 
1 2 0θ θ θ= =  since under this constraint the 
impedance ratio RZ, which is equal to Z2/Z1, 
can be determined analytically from the given 
resonant frequencies of the λ/2 SIR [16]. With 
f1 and f3 denoting the desired odd-numbered 
DM resonant frequencies, which of course are 
set to be the center frequencies of the desired 
lower and upper DM passbands, respectively, 
the impedance ratio can be calculated by 
( ) ( )10 1 3 1= cot 1zf R f fθ π− = +     (1) 
Note that this equation is slightly different 
from that given in [16] because the two ends 
of the λ/2 SIR in our DM operation are 
short-circuited rather than open-circuited as in 
[16]. By setting f1 and f3 to be 2.45 and 5.25 
GHz, respectively, we can find that RZ = 0.413 
and 0 1( ) 57.27fθ = ° . To proceed with 
convenience, we fix Z2 at 24.4 Ω so that the 
corresponding line width of 2 mm is an integer 
value. All other relevant structural parameters 
can in turn be computed accordingly. In fact, 
these structural parameters still need to 
undergo fine tuning in deploying the entire 
BPF because the effects of dispersion and the 
mitered bending discontinuities are not taken 
into account in Eq. (1). The BPF’s structural 
parameters, optimized with the aid of Ansoft 
HFSS, are given in Fig. 5 
Figure 6 shows the photograph of the 
fabricated balanced dual-band BPF, which 
when exclusive of the 50-Ω  feeding lines 
occupies an area of 46.2 × 13.8 mm2. As 
shown in Fig. 7, the simulated and measured 
S-parameters agree well to each other. For the 
DM response, the measured (simulated) first 
and second passbands of 2.39-2.49 (2.4-2.5) 
and 5.15-5.35 (5.15-5.36) GHz, respectively, 
are centered at 2.44 (2.45) and 5.25 (5.25) 
GHz and have minimum insertion losses of 1 
(1.3) and 1.3 (1.5) dB. The out-of-band 
rejection is larger than 20 dB except for the 
frequency range of around 4 GHz, within 
which the second differential resonant mode 
appears not completely suppressed because of 
the source-load coupling. For the CM 
response in the displayed frequency range of 
1−7 GHz, the measured (simulated) insertion 
loss is greater than 20.5 (22) dB. In particular, 
the measured CM suppressions in the first and 
second DM passbands are larger than 29 and 
22 dB, respectively.

frequency ranges of 1.557−1.593 GHz, 
3.4−3.7 GHz, and 5.15−5.35 GHz, 
respectively. Furthermore, the filter circuit is 
to be implemented on a 0.635-mm-thick 
RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with a dielectric 
constant of 10.2 and a loss tangent of 0.0023. 
The first step in this filter design is to 
determine the dimensions of Z1, Z2, and Z3 
sections of the TSSIRs. For that purpose, the 
resonant frequencies of the higher-order 
modes of the λ/2 TSSIR can be expressed as

Then by assuming equal electric length for 
these three sections (namely, θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = θ0), 
the impedance ratio K1 (= Z3 / Z2) and K2 (= Z2 
/ Z1) calculated by using (2) − (5) [17] are 1.89 
and 1.67, respectively. The electric length ( 01θ ) 
at the center frequency of the first passband 
(namely, 1.57 GHz) computed by using 
( )101 1 2 1 2tan 1K K K Kθ −= + +  [17] is 40.3o. 
Considering fabrication precision limit, the 
widths of Z1, Z2, and Z2 sections are set to 2.31, 
1.04, and 0.23 mm, respectively, which are 
equivalently 21.6 and 36, and 68 Ω  in 
characteristic impedance. Note that the above 
design procedure applies equally well to both 
λ/2 and λ/4 TSSIRs. However, since the λ/4 
TSSIRs do not support even modes, equations 
(2) and (4) do not apply to such resonators. 
Once the dimensions of the TSSIRs are 
known, we can proceed to determine the 
widths and lengths of the coupling gaps 
between the coupled TSSIRs as well as the 
input/output tap positions. For this design, a 
technique based on coupling coefficient and 
external quality factor is adopted. By this 
approach, the gap width and the coupling 
length between coupled TSSIRs are 
determined from the required coupling 
coefficients, and the tap positions of the 
input/output λ/2 TSSIRs are designed 
according to the desired external quality factor 
[18]. For the proposed BPF, the 3-dB 
fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of the three 
passbands are initially set to be 5%, 10%, and 
6%, which, to be on the safe side, are a bit 
larger than the actually needed ones (namely, 
2.3%, 8.57%, and 3.8%, respectively, for the 
three passbands). Meanwhile, we choose a 
fourth-order Butterworth function as the target 
BPF response, for which, the element values 
(g0 – g4) of the corresponding lowpass filter 
prototype can be found in [14]. The required 
external quality factor ddeQ = 0 1g g⋅ Δ  of the 
λ/2 TSSIRs at the three passband center 
frequencies (in low-to-high frequency 
sequence) can then be calculated to be 15.31, 
7.65, and 12.76. The coupling coefficients 
between TSSIRs can be found to be 12ddM  = 
21
ddM  = 1 2g gΔ ⋅  = 0.042, 0.084, and 0.05 
and 22ddM  = 2 3g gΔ ⋅ = 0.027, 0.054, and 
0.032, respectively, for the three passbands 
[17]. In the above, 12ddM  ( 21ddM ) stands for the 
coupling coefficient between TSSIR (1) (the 
λ/2 TSSIR) and TSSIR (2) (the λ/4 TSSIR) 
and 22ddM  is the one between TSSIRs (2) (the 
two λ/4 TSSIRs). Once the external quality 
factor and the coupling coefficients are known, 
the gap width and the coupling length between 
the coupled TSSIRs as well as the tap 
positions of the input/output λ/2 TSSIRs can 
be determined by parametric studies through 
simulation. Detailed dimensions, obtained 
after fine tuning, are shown in Figure 8.

II. WIDEBAND BALANCED BPF DESIGN 
Fig. 1 shows the top view of the proposed second-order 
wide-band balanced bandpass filter, which are printed on a 
0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate with dielectric 
constant 10.2 and loss tangent 0.0023. The two coupled λ/2 
CPW SIRs in the filter are fed by microstrip sections of width 
W1 and length L1 that are parallel to the SIRs and are tapered 
to connect to four decoupled 50-Ω  microstrip lines. Ports 1 
and 1’ are formed as an input or output port for balanced 
operation, whereas ports 2 and 2’ are grouped as the other. 
Because of the structural symmetry, the complete BPF 
behaves the same as the half circuit with the plane of 
symmetry (POS) replaced by an electric (magnetic) wall if 
the input signal is of odd (even) mode with respect to the 
POS. A perspective view of the half circuit is shown in Fig. 2. 
For convenience, the half CPW-resonator area is re-sketched 
in Fig. 3(a) for differential-mode operation and in Fig. 3(b) 
for common-mode operation.

              (b) 
Fig. 3. (a) DM and (b) CM half circuits for the CPW resonator only. 
For differential-mode operation, a signal on the input 
microstrip line is coupled to the first CPW resonator, then to 
the second, and finally to the output microstrip line. Because 
of the strong coupling between the two CPW resonators, we 
expect that mode splitting will occur and two 11S  nulls will 
result. In Fig. 3(a), the coupled CPW resonators, each with 
one end open-circuited and the other short-circuited, can be 
viewed as a single λ/4 CPW resonator with an embedded 
slotline of width W3 that is shorted at the electric wall. The 
embedded shorted slotline will introduce a transmission zero 
at the frequency at which the length of the embedded slotline 
is a quarter-wavelength [8], [9]. Although the position of the 
transmission zero was parametrically studied in [8], no 
phenomenological explanation was provided. In what follows, 
we will explain why this transmission zero exists and why 
two 11S  nulls are found in the passband. The structure of 
the CPW resonator without the embedded slotline in Fig. 3(a) 
can be alternatively regarded as a λ/2 slotline resonator. The 
input signal on one microstrip line is coupled to the slotline 
resonator around the resonant frequency and then to the other 
microstrip line, thus forming a simple BPF. A slotline line is 
dual to a microstrip line. A λ/2 open-circuited microstrip 
resonator tapped at its center by an open stub forms a 
dual-mode resonator [10]. With the dual-mode microstrip 
resonator coupled to the input and output microstrip line, two 
11S  nulls in the passband can be found if the length of the 
stub is appropriately selected. However, at the frequency at 
which the stub is of quarter-wavelength long, the stub appears 
to be an infinite load to the λ/2 microstrip resonator since the 
impedance looking into the stub from the junction of the stub 
and the resonator is zero, thus leading to a transmission zero 
at that frequency [10]. Note that a λ/2 short-circuited slotline 
resonator is indeed dual to a λ/2 open-circuited microstrip 
resonator. An open microstrip stub to an open-circuited 
microstrip resonator is what a short slotline stub to a 
short-circuited slotline resonator. If the length of the short 
slotline stub is properly designed, two 11S  nulls can be 
located in the passband of the simple BPF consisting of a 
slotline resonator. In addition, a transmission zero will occur 
when the length of the short stub is a quarter-wavelength. 
For common-mode operation, a single λ/2 CPW resonator 
can be formed if the gap between the two coupled CPW 
resonators in Fig. 3(b) is filled with conductor. This single λ/2 
CPW resonator is designed to be of stepped-impedance type 
with the high-impedance section located adjacent to the 
magnetic wall. The resonant frequency is larger than twice 
the resonant frequency of the single λ/4 CPW resonator 
associated with Fig. 3(a) [11]. Hence, around the 
differential-mode passband, the common-mode insertion loss 
is expected to be larger than the differential-mode one. On the 
other hand, the configuration with two coupled CPW 
resonators (i.e., Fig. 3(b)) requires one additional coupling 
action in the transmission path than does the configuration 
with a single CPW resonator. The former is expected to 
possess larger common-mode suppression than the latter.

Metamaterials and trheir Microwave Applications」等。而往年都會與會議同時舉行
之廠商展示，今年更是擴大規模，由IEICE主辦、日本總務省後源，展場在會議
中心對面之Exhibition Hall of Pacifico Yokohama，總共有超過130家世界各地之微
波與通訊廠商參展，例如知名之安捷倫科技(Agilent Technologies)公司、Ansoft
公司、Fujitsu公司、(羅德史瓦茲)Rohde & Schwartz公司、Sonnet Giken公司、
Toshiba公司等。此外，今年度也特別於展場中邀請了超過20所各國大學做其在
微波領域之獨有研究成果展示，這其中台彎的交通大學與中央大學皆為應邀參展
之學校。 
 
二、與會心得 
在四天的研討會期中，大會每天依論文性質於上下午各安排近六個不同場次
同時進行論文發表和討論。綜觀此次會議所提之論文主題，天線與傳播、微波電
路及微波組件等仍按佔重要比例，天線(包括手機(行動)天線、多頻/寬頻天線與
智慧型陣列天線等)及微波電路(包括濾波器、功率分配器及耦合器等)每日皆有數
個場次進行。由發表之論文顯示，近年來手機及小型天線之設計研究相當熱絡，
構型也多樣化以適合各種不同使用場合(如手機、筆電、PDA 等)。而其他之新型
主動式與被動式天線研究，則主要在智慧型天線之特性解析、訊號處理、訊號饋
入方式、增大頻寬與縮小尺寸之技術及相關應用等，包括理論探討與實驗測試。
而微波電路方面則包括放大器、振盪器、功率分配器、多工器、及濾波器等，其
中濾波器佔了很大之比例，尤其是多頻及超寬頻方面之主題，而其電路之 IC 化
也是目前之趨勢所在。不過一般型多頻及超寬頻濾波器方面之研究已漸趨飽和，
平衡式多頻及超寬頻濾波器目前則較少有成果發表。此外其他如左手系介質及其
在相關電路設計之應用主題等亦是此次研討會投稿較多之領域。 
    此次研討會主題中，與筆者較相關之議題有寬頻天線及微波濾波器設計等。
筆者與學生亦於會中 Session TH1G Open Forum 發表了主題為「Wideband 
Balanced BPF Design for MB-OFD Applications」之論文。單端進出之寬頻/超寬頻
帶通濾波器近年有很多之論文發表，本年度此同一場次中就有數篇以各種不同電
路結構或技術設計之作品。然筆者與學生所發表之平衡式寬頻濾波器則較少作品
見諸期刊，故此次之 Open Foru 也提供了彼此切磋、討論之有效平台。 
 
三、建議 
國內微波電路、通訊及天線方面之研究學者及學生近年來增加不少，尤其是
天線及微波電路方面。主要集中在台大電機、電信、交大電信、成大電機、中山
電機(通訊)、中正電機(通訊)、元智通訊、大同通訊、逢甲通訊、高雄師大電子(光
電與通訊)、彰化師大電子(電信)等校系所及中山科學院、工業技術研究院等，此
次 2010 AMPC 會議即有來自國內之 156 篇論文投稿，可說是成果豐碩。
