This research describes a new polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-based 
blue-light electroluminescent nanoparticle, octakis[N-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl) 
undecanamide-11-dimethylsiloxy] silsesquioxane (POSS-C11-Cz), which contains 
eight carbazole chromophore arms, synthesized through the hydrosilation reaction 
of octakis(dimethylsiloxy)silsesquioxane with the terminal olefin Cz-C11ene. 
POSS-C11-Cz exhibits good thermal and electrochemical stabilities and good 
film-forming properties. The optical and photoluminescence spectra of 
POSS-C11-Cz in solution and in the solid state indicate a reduction in the degrees 
of aggregation and excimer formation because interchain interactions were 
prohibited by the bulky POSS core.

We have used a very large scale integration process to generate well-defined 
patterns of polymerized 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) on patterned 
Si(100) surfaces. An atom transfer radical polymerization initiator covalently 
bonded to the patterned surface was employed for the graft polymerization of 
HEMA to prepare the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes. 
After immersing wafers presenting lines of these polymers in water and 
cyclohexane, we observed brush- and mushroomlike regions, respectively, for the 
PHEMA brushes, with various pattern resolutions. The PHEMA brushes behaved 
as “tentacles” that captured ferritin complexes from aqueous solution through 
entanglement between the brushes and the ferritin proteins, whose ferritins were 
trapped due to the collapsing of the PHEMA. Using high-resolution scanning 
electron microscopy, we observed patterned ferritin iron cores on the Si surface 
after thermal removal of the patterned PHEMA brushes and ferritin protein 
sheaths.

Photoluminescence and PLED Manufactured Through POSS-C11-Cz/ 
Polyfluorene Blend 
(製作出具有高強度與光色澤度之 PLED 元件, Acta Materialia 57, 1938-1946 
(2009)) 
From optical and electroluminescence measurements, we found that the 
attachment to the POSS cage suppressed the aggregation and enhanced the color 
stability of 3,9-carbazole units both in solution and in the solid state. 
POSS-C11-Cz also behaves as an effective dopant that enhances energy transfer 
from itself to POF. In addition, POSS-C11-Cz improves the quantum efficiency 
and color stability of POF because its presence reduces the degree of aggregation 
and the formation of keto defects. A POSS-C11-Cz (3 wt%)/POF (97 wt%)-based 
device exhibited higher maximum brightness and luminance efficiency than did 
the non-blended POF-based device. Devices were fabricated in the configuration 
ITO/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT, 35 nm)/polymer (ca. 60 
nm)/1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBI, 30 nm)/LiF (150 
nm )/Al (100 nm). We assembled the device through sequential coating of PEDOT 
(to improve the hole injection), POSS-C11-Cz (emissive layer), TPBI 
(electro-transport material), LiF (electrode), and Al layers onto ITO (transparent 
anode). Interestingly, the maximum brightness of the EL obtained from a 
POSS-C11-Cz (3 wt%)/PACz (97 wt%) blend was twice that of the PACz-based 
device, and the turn-on voltage was reduced from 10.5 to 7.5 V. Thus, a small 
amount POSS-C11-Cz acted as an effective dopant to transfer energy to PACz; 
therefore, POSS-C11-Cz appears to have potential for use in improving the 
quantum efficiency and color stability of polyfluorenes through blending. The PL 
spectra (figure 2) reveal that the green emission peak at 530 nm of the 
POSS-C11-Cz (3%)/POF (97%) blend in the solid state had a lower intensity than 
that of the POF polymer itself. The PL stability of this blend is similar to that of 
other polyfluorene derivatives, indicating that incorporation of POSS-C11-Cz into 
POF polymer reduces the extent of both aggregation and keto defects of the POF. 
In addition, the incorporation of POSS-C11-Cz did not appreciably change the EL 
and quantum efficiencies of the POF. However, the POSS-C11-Cz (3 wt%)/POF 
(97 wt%)-based device exhibited higher maximum brightness and luminance 
efficiency than did the POF-based device because of the doping effect of 
POSS-C11-Cz (figure 3), which enhanced energy transfer efficiency from the 
carbazole chromophore groups on POSS-C11-Cz to POF and suppressed the

軟性高介電元件 
Improved reliability from a plasma-assisted metal-insulator-metal capacitor

Plastic circuits have received growing interest because they combine plastic 
substrates with new classes of organic materials using low-cost fabrication 
approaches, such as inkjet printing and liquid film casting. They are considered to 
be a key emerging technology for this century with their potential as an 
ultralow-cost and light-weight alternative to Si wafers. In some instances, they are 
compatible with continuous, high-speed reel-to-reel fabrication, high mechanical 
flexibility, transparent to visible/UV radiation, and can allow the circuit board to 
conform to a desired shape or flex during its use. Subsequently, plastic circuits 
appear to be a foundation for future electronic devices, such as electronic papers, 
wearable sensors, low-cost smart cards, radio frequency identification tags, and 
flexible arrays of plastic microphones. Recently, in terms of their superior bending, 
it was found that flexible organic transistors can perform better than flexible 
inorganic transistors. Reliability stress testing is very important method for 
analyzing the bending and stretching properties of flexible devices designed for 
such applications as accurate sensors for hydrogen or for integration into artificial 
muscles or biological tissues. We have used a sol–gel spin-coating process to 
fabricate a new metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitor in Fig. 1 comprising a 10 
nm–thick high-k thin dielectric HfO2 film on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate. 
The surface morphology of this HfO2 film was investigated using atomic force 
microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed that continuous 
and crack-free film growth had occurred on the film surface. After oxygen (O2) 
plasma pretreatment and subsequent annealing at 250°C, the film on the PI 
substrate exhibited a low leakage current density of 3.64x10-9 A cm–2 at 5 V and a 
maximum capacitance density of 10.35 fF µm–2 at 1 MHz. The as-deposited sol–
gel film was completely oxidized when employing O2 plasma at a relatively low 
temperature (ca. 250 ° C), thereby enhancing the electrical performance. We 
employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at both high and low 
resolution to examine the chemical composition of the film subjected to various 
treatment conditions. The shift of the XPS peaks towards higher binding energy, 
revealed that O2 plasma treatment was the most effective process for the complete 
oxidation of hafnium atoms at low temperature. A study of the insulator properties 
indicated the excellent bendability of our MIM capacitor; the flexible PI substrate

Currently, there has been increasing demands on reducing the feature size in 
microelectronic products and more interested in the development of electronic 
circuits on flexible substrates to meet the growing worldwide demand for low 
processing temperature, low-cost fabrication, large-area, and lightweight devices. 
In addition, ultra-low dielectric constant (k) materials are crucial to minimizing 
resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, power consumption, and cross-talk noise. And 
most of the organic-organic nanocomposites are known as low-k dielectric 
material. Therefore, organic/polymer and organic-polymer nanocomposite 
materials have attracted a lot of attention for building large-area and mechanically 
flexible electronic devices. These materials are also widely pursued because they 
offer numerous advantages in terms of ease of processing, good compatibility with 
a variety of substrates, and great opportunity for structural modifications. Apart 
from above mention there is also a strong desire to develop new large-scale 
materials that can meet the growing demand for miniaturization, high-speed 
performance, and flexibility for microelectronic devices. And the next generation 
of intermetal dielectric (IMD) materials for microelectronic devices must have an 
ultra-low-k of less than 2.0 to meet the National Technology Roadmap for 
Semiconductors. New organic-organic nanoscale composite thin film (NCTF) 
dielectric in Figs. 1 and 2 has been synthesized via solution deposition of 
1-bromoadamantane and triblock copolymer (Pluronic P123, BASF, 
EO20-PO70-EO20), where the precursor solution has been achieved with organic 
additives. We have used a sol-gel process to make metal-insulator-metal capacitor 
comprising a nanoscale (10 nm-thick) thin-film on flexible polyimide (PI) 
substrate at room temperature. Scanning electron microscope and atomic force 
microscope revealed that the deposited NCTFs were crack-free, uniform, high 
resistance to moisture absorption and well adhered on the Au/Cr/PI. The electrical 
properties of 1-bromoadamantane-P123 NCTF were characterized by dielectric 
constant, capacitance and leakage current measurements. The 
1-bromoadamantane-P123 NCTF on the PI substrate showed low leakage current 
density of 5.5×10-11 A cm-2 and good capacitance of 2.4 fF at 1 MHz. In addition, 
the calculated dielectric constant of 1-bromoadamantane-P123 NCTF is 1.9, 
making them suitable candidates for use in future flexible electronic devices as a 
stable intermetal dielectric. The electrical insulating properties in Fig. 3 of
