Abstract
Keywords: Ultra-wideband, time-hopping spread spcetrum, impulse radio, direct-sequence
spread-spectrum, power spectral density.
The ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is very promising for the strong demand for
low-cost high-speed wireless communications. Owing to its ultra-wide bandwidth, a UWB
system has potential advantages over conventional systems, such as robustness to multipath
and fading, coexistence with other systems using the same band, high data rate capability,
and fine time resolution. In this project, we are mainly concerned about two important
single-band UWB systems, namely, time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) impulse radio
and direct-sequence spread-spectrum.
In this year’s project, exact signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) analysis of
direct-sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) systems with Rake receiving in the presence of inter-
symbol interference and multiple-access interference over realistic UWB channel models is
conducted. The SINR expression, considering the code correlation functions and a generic
Rake receiver with variable number of combining fingers, is first derived. The statistics
of the UWB channel models, defined by the IEEE 802.15.3a Study Group, are then taken
into account. Because of the high multipath resolution offered by UWB signals, the UWB
channel exhibits a unique path-arriving phenomenon, which can, however, complicate the
analysis. Nevertheless, by exploiting the property of Poisson path arrivals, the exact average
SINR is obtained in this report. Our analytical results well match computer simulations and

Introduction
In the near future, there will appear a strong demand for low-cost high-speed wireless tech-
nology for short-range communications. A key driver in this trend is the steep growth in
both demand and deployment of wireless local area networks (WLAN) and wireless personal
area networks (WPAN) based on the wireless standards such as IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.
Short-range wireless technology will play a key role in scenarios where “everybody and ev-
erything” is connected by different types of communication links: human to human, human
to machine, machine to human, and machine to machine. Besides voice and data, such links
should be able to support digital video transmission, which requires high data rates. The
potential applications include video conferencing, home networking, interactive applications,
and content downloading, etc.
One very promising technology for such demand is called ultra-wideband (UWB) [1]–
[7]. A generic definition used by US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [8] and
widely accepted by the industry defines a UWB device as any device emitting signals with
a fractional bandwidth (bandwidth divided by the center frequency) greater than 20% or
a bandwidth of at least 500 MHz (regardless of the fractional bandwidth), at all times of
transmission. Owing to its ultra-wide bandwidth, a UWB system has potential advantages
over conventional systems, such as robustness to multipath and fading, coexistence with
1
functions and a partial Rake receiver with variable number of combining fingers, is first
derived. The baseband channels considered are generated and down-converted from the IEEE
802.15.3a channel models. Then, by exploiting the Poisson property in cluster/ray arrivals,
the exact average SINR over the channel statistics is obtained. Our analytical results well
match computer simulations and can be readily applied to performance prediction/evaluation
and system optimization over realistic channel and interference models. Possible applications
include determination of the least number of Rake fingers to achieve a certain performance
requirement, finding the best spreading codes, etc.
This report is organized as follows. The IEEE 802.15.3a channel model and the previous
work in [12] are described in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we define our system models and
derive the ISI, MAI, and noise terms of the received signal in DS-UWB systems. In Chapter
4, we introduce some useful characteristics of the Poisson distribution and derive the average
path energy and average cross path energy. Numerical and simulation results are shown in
Chapter 5. Finally, we conclude this work in Chapter 6.

Λ and λ, respectively. Therefore, we have
p(Tl|Tl−1) = Λ exp[−Λ(Tl − Tl−1)], l > 0
p(τk,l|τ(k−1),l) = λ exp[−λ(τk,l − τ(k−1),l)], k > 0.
The multipath gain coefficient αk,l is defined as αk,l = pk,lξlβk,l, where pk,l represents the
random reflection by taking value from {1,−1} with equal probability, ξl is the fading coef-
ficient of the lth cluster, and βk,l stands for the additional fading of the kth ray in the lth
cluster. We denote a Gaussian random variable with mean µ and variance σ2 as N (µ, σ2). In
addition, 20 log 10(ξlβk,l) ∼ N (µk,l, σ21 + σ22), that is to say, |ξlβk,l| = 10(µk,l+n1+n2)/20 where
n1 ∼ N (0, σ21) and n2 ∼ N (0, σ22) are independent and corresponding to the fading on each
cluster and ray, respectively. The random variable µk,l is given by
µk,l =
10 ln(Ω0)− 10Tl/Γ− 10τk,l/γ
ln(10)

where Ω0 is the mean energy of the first path in the first cluster, and consequently, one can
have

.
The shadowing effect is then described by multiplying the ith channel realization with
Xi, i = 1, 2, . . ., after normalizing

Lemma 2.2.1. The probability that the mth (m = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1) time bin has a ray con-
tribution to nth (n>1) time bin τn, denoted by P
(n)
m , can be calculated in two cases:
P (n)m =

Pc · Pr, 2 ≤ m ≤ n− 1.
Using this lemma and listing all possible arrival patterns in nth time bin, the average
path energy can be derived as

As the average output SINR of a TH multiple-access UWB system with Rake receiver
relates to the path power derived in (2.2), an analytical expression for the SINR can then
be obtained [12]. However, the results must be restricted to systems with very fine channel
resolution for validity of the Binomial approximation. In addition, the ISI effect is ignored
by assuming perfect TH codes, which limits the practicability of the above SINR analysis.

Recalling the fact that E{η[n]η[m]} = N0δ[n − m], we can conclude that (3.9) is not zero
only if m = m′ and n = n′. Hence, σ2rec can be simplified as
σ2rec = EsN0
Nf−1∑
i=0
E
{
|A(1)i |2
}
(3.10)
where N0 is the one-sided power spectral density of η(t) mentioned previously.

Using the definition of Poisson process, we can have the following useful theorem [19].
Theorem 4.1.2. Given that N(t) = n, the n arrival times S1, . . . , Sn have the same distri-
bution as the order statistics of n independent random variables uniformly distributed on the
interval (0,t).
4.2 Evaluation of Exact SINR for DS-UWB Systems
Using the results of Chapter 3, we can find the output SINR in a DS-UWB system as
SINR =
(
Es
∑Nf−1
i=0 E{|A(1)i |2}
)2
E{ISI′2}+∑Nuν=2 E{|u(ν)(k)|2}+ σ2rec . (4.1)
The computation of (4.1) requires the evaluation of average path energy and average cross
path energy. In the following sections, we evaluate these two terms.
4.2.1 Average Path Energy
Recall that the multipath gain coefficient is defined as αk,l = pk,lξlβk,l. We assume that
there are m ray arrivals in the nth time bin and consider the baseband UWB channel model.
Hence, the power of the weighted summation of multipath gain coefficients in the nth time
bin can be written as
E{|An|2} = E

Nevertheless, there are still two effects needed to be considered. One is that there is always
a cluster arriving at time 0 and the other is that there is always a ray at each time a cluster
arrives. Therefore, if there is always a cluster arriving at time 0, the power contribution of
this cluster to the nth path can be expressed as

If there is always a ray at each time a cluster arrives, we need to consider the following two
cases:
Case I:
• The ray at time 0 (belong to the cluster arriving at time 0) always contributes to the

where {piξiβi exp(−j2wcθi)} is the down-converted multipath gain coefficient in the nth time
bin and {p′iξ′iβ′i exp(−j2wcθ′i)} is the down-converted multipath gain coefficient in the mth
time bin.
It is also clear that E{(A(1)n )∗2A(1)2m } is the complex conjugate of E{A(1)2n (A(1)m )∗2}. In
addition, E{|A(1)n |2|A(1)m |2} is a special case of E{A(1)2n (A(1)m )∗2} when we set wc = 0. Therefore,
we only need to evaluate E{A(1)2n (A(1)m )∗2} so that E{(A(1)n )∗2A(1)2m } and E{|A(1)n |2|A(1)m |2} can
then be easily obtained.
Using the results of (4.5), we can obtain that them ray arrivals in themth time bin can be
divided into two groups called A and B, respectively. Ray arrivals in group A belong to the
clusters arriving before time (n+1)T and ray arrivals in group B belong to the clusters arriv-
ing between time (n+1)T and (m+1)T . Therefore, we define {p′i,Aξ′i,Aβi,A exp(−j2wcθ′i,A)} ∈
A and {p′i,Bξ′i,Bβi,B exp(−j2wcθ′i,B)} ∈ B where {p′i,Aξ′i,Aβi,A exp(−j2wcθ′i,A)} and
{p′i,Bξ′i,Bβi,B exp(−j2wcθ′i,B)} are the components of {p′iξ′iβ′i exp(−j2wcθ′i)}. In addition, the
n ray arrivals in the nth time bin all belong to the clusters arriving before time (n + 1)T .

If there is LOS, we need to add some extra terms as follows:{

Hence, the power of the LOS case can be written as

Conclusion
In this report, we have derived an exact analytical expression of the average output SINR
for a DS-UWB system with Rake receiving in the presence of ISI and MAI over the IEEE
802.15.3a channel models. The code correlation functions, a generic Rake receiver with vari-
able number of combining fingers, and the precise cluster and ray characteristics of Poisson
arrivals have all been taken into consideration. Computer simulations have verified the accu-
racy of our analysis over different channel and system parameters. The obtained analytical
results can readily be applied to performance prediction/evaluation and system optimization
over realistic channel and interference models. Two example applications, namely, determi-
nation of the least number of Rake fingers to achieve a certain performance requirement
and finding the spreading codes contributing to the best SINR value, have also been demon-
strated. Possible extension of this work may include investigation of the effect of different
pulse shaping functions [5] and extension of the analysis to the IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel
models [20].
