problem, we reduce this affect by adopting the 
digital fuzzy controller with feedforward of a 
reference signal and a Nonlinear AutoRegressive 
Moving Average eXogenous (NARMAX) neural model 
design. In practice, the CT nonlinear delayed system 
is modeled by using a NARMAX techniques with the 
first-stage (off-line) method by the proposed global 
optimal network algorithm and second-stage (on-line) 
adaptive steps. Second, the dynamic response of the 
system is controlled by an adaptive NARMAX fuzzy 
controller via a NARMAX neural plant model. Finally, 
the feedforward input from a reference signal helps 
the digital fuzzy controller improve the control 
performance, and the techniques also can precisely 
control the CT systems.

industrial communities, and there have been many 
successful applications. Despite this success, it has 
become evident that many basic and important issues [3] 
remain to be further addressed. Of these stability analysis 
and systematic designs are among the most important 
issues for fuzzy control systems [4] and robust control 
theories [1][5-8]. There has been significant research on 
these issues (see [4][9-10]). In addition, a fuzzy 
controller has been suggested as an alternative approach 
to conventional PID control techniques [11] for complex 
control systems [1]. Moreover, Neural-Network (NN) 
based modeling has become an active research field 
because of its unique merits in solving complex 
nonlinear system identification and control problems (see 
[10]). Neural networks (NNs) or NARMAX/NARX 
neural network [12], inspired by biological neural 
systems, are composed of simple elements operating in 
parallel. In a similar way to learning in biological neural 
systems, we can train a neural network to represent a 
particular function by adjusting the weights between 
elements. Due to a discrete-time (DT) controller being 
cheaper and more flexible than a continuous-time (CT) 
controller, the DT control problem for CT plants is worth 
studying. In modern control engineering, controllers are 
commonly implemented directly by hardware or 
software instructions from digital computers. However, 
one important issue has to be faced; that is, the new 
design (DT-CT design) problem effects a new type of 
application, and an adaptive NN-model-based design 
method has not yet been developed to adjust the 
parameters of a discrete-time (DT) adaptive fuzzy 
controller such that the original continuous-time (CT) 
system with time delays and uncertainties is uniformly 
ultimately bounded (UUB) stable. Hence, we try to use 
an adaptive control method to improve the DT control 
performance of the proposed DT-CT design by tuning the 
parameters of model and controller. 
The study of CT control of CT time-delay systems 
has received considerable attention in recent years since 
delay is a major cause of poor performance in many 
important engineering systems [13-15]. Hence, the future 
direction of CT time-delay control systems needs to 
involve the DT control problem. The amount of delay 
has different impacts on the various approaches [15-19]. 
As we know, the delay control problem is an important 
and complex factor in the stability performance of CT 
nonlinear systems. In general, delay signals happen in 
signals’ long-distance or heat translations. 
Based on the timer of a micro-controller or Digital 
Signal Process (DSP) chip, the effect of delay in neural 
system identification can be approximated by many 
tape-delay terms. This reduces the difficulty of delay 
identification largely. The DT NARMAX model is 
general enough to approximate unknown, nonlinear, 
dynamic and delayed CT systems by selecting 
appropriate sampling times. 
The feedforward term in [20] is derived indirectly 
by assuming some constraints. Due to the overfitting 
problem and the local optimal problem of NN, the 
method [20] is not suitable for real-time/on-line 
applications because of the need for lengthy convergence 
time. To alleviate the real-time and on-line requirements 
for the accurate modeling of the plant, the NARMAX 
plant and control models are initially trained by using an 
off-line method. 
On the other hand, these neural techniques [21-23] 
have usually been demonstrated in a nonlinear control 
due to their powerful nonlinear modeling capability [24] 
and adaptability. However, they must exhibit the optimal 
problems of falling into the local minimum easily by 
using the Back-Propagation (BP) [25] method. Hence, 
we propose the RLS algorithm to improve this drawback. 
It not only guarantees the gradient decent method against 
the local optimal solution, but also speeds up the 
convergence of the random search method (RSM) [26]. 
Inspired by the DT neural controller of [20] only for 
a DT system, we propose a digital fuzzy control design 
for a CT system, and use an approximate inverse of the 
delayed plant dynamics to act as the NARMAX fuzzy 
controller. The adaptive controller and NARMAX

The proposed digital fuzzy controller ku  has 
feedforward terms and a recursive structure. It can use a 
NARMAX neural model or an inverse of the plant 
dynamics to aid control precision in the face of a delayed 
plant. Due to the adaptive fuzzy controller, the 
uncertainty of plant can be suppressed. Although the 
structure of the fuzzy controller is chosen as (3), the 
parameter vector kCW )(  is not specified; therefore, the 
fuzzy controller has not been designed. sT⋅γ  is the 
tape-delay time and γ  is a positive integer. The idea of 
the inverse-model-based fuzzy controller is proposed by 
the following simplified relation: 
If )(ˆ kk uPy = , )()(ˆ 1 kFkk rCrPu == − , then kk ry = , (5) 
where )(ˆ ⋅P  is the adaptive NARMAX neural model of 
plant; )(⋅FC  is the adaptive NARMAX fuzzy controller; 
kr  is desired output. According the idea of eq. (5), we 
can design the recursive structure )(ˆ ⋅P  with the tape 
delays as follow:

compared with the desired output to create a system error 
signal kkk yre −= . The errors kkk yre ˆˆ −=  and ke  are 
used by the adaptation algorithm to update the 
parameters of Pˆ  and FC . Next, we design the

approximation on the bounded error kk yy −ˆ .

bounded via the controller. 
Hence, the dynamic response of the system P  
can be controlled by using FC , shown in Fig. 1. This 
FC  needs the plant model Pˆ  to adjust control 
parameters. 
3.2 Two-stage scheme 
Fig. 1 shows a block-diagram of an adaptive 
recursive control system. The system we attempt to 
control is labeled as the plant P which is subject to 
uncertainties and delays. Next, the NARMAX’s model of 
this the plant P  and fuzzy controller is trained by the 
gradient-descent algorithm that usually makes the trained 
parameters of this model and controller converge into a 
local optimization; hence, we propose the following 
two-stage training algorithm to ensure that the trained 
parameters of the model and controller are global 
optimal. 
In the first stage we used the measured data to train 
the global optimal NARMAX plant and the fuzzy 
controller by the training-data-shuffle method. This

After that, we arrange for the following algorithm

To clarify our method, in [20], a robust and 
adaptive method was used to allow learning to occur 
on-line, tuning performance as the system runs. However, 
[20] did not consider the modeling error, global optimal 
initialization of control parameters, the lengthy 
convergence time of on-line control, delayed terms, 
uncertainties in plant and DT-CT problems. Moreover, 
the choice method of initial parameters of the on-line 
controller still does not overcome the overfitting problem 
of the controller. So we propose the off-line stage for a 
RLS learning algorithm to choose the initial weights and 
biases of the on-line fuzzy controller in the simulation 
example of the power plant in Section 4 as follows 
4. Cases study 
Referring to Fig. 1, and the above sections, we have 
seen how to model the plant dynamics by considering the 
modeling error, and how to use the neural model of plant 
to adapt a fuzzy controller. To compare with other 
methods, we introduce the following cases: 
Case 1: This case is in [29], and its digital controller is a 
kind of fuzzy controller with integral term. 
Case 2: This case is in [31], and its controller is a kind of 
single neuron without multi-layer structure, and this CT 
controller is discretized to DT controller to compare with 
Case 3. 
Case 3: This is our control method, and the proposed 
neural-model-based fuzzy controller is adaptive and 
globally optimal. 
The detail designs of the Case 1−Case 3 are as follows. 
Case 1 is a LMI control method of the original example 
for this power plant. The control parameters of Case 1 
are as follows: 
TKK 0.9348]  [0.0476,2111 == , -426.49692212 == KK , 
and this T-S fuzzy controller of Case 1 is design as:

We design 6002 =P  and learning rate 1=η  of Case 2. 
Case 3 is also an adaptive control method, but its 
NARMAX fuzzy control design method is very different 
from Case 2. 
First, the sampling time of the model/controller is 
set for 410−=sT sec to simulate the proposed control 
system, the initial state Tx ]0,0[)0( = , and the reference 
signal )30sin(12 sk Tkr ⋅= .Case 3 uses NN structure 5-8-1

the plant model, whose summation PSW is updated as 
shown in Fig. 2a. The summation CSW  of fuzzy control 
parameters CW  is updated as shown in Fig. 2b. The

5. Conclusions 
The proposed two-stage adaptive control converges 
very quickly, works highly effectively and precisely. It is 
very simple, and works for nonlinear delayed plants with 
uncertainty. The recursive and feedforward control 
scheme is partitioned into two stages that can be 
independently optimized. First, an off-line neural model 
of a continuous-time (CT) nonlinear power plant is made. 
Second, a constrained off-line digital fuzzy controller is 
generated; then, an adaptive plant model is made, and an 
adaptive NARMAX fuzzy controller is generated. 
Finally, all processes may continue concurrently, and 
robustness control and DT-CT problem for a power plant 
is solved.
