1. INTRODUCTION 
In wind engineering, the importance of bridge aero-elasticity is well recognized because it could 
potentially cause devastation.  A typical example is the collapse of Tacoma Narrows suspension 
bridge in 1940.  It has drawn much attention on researches in the last few decades, among which 
the most important initiative of modeling such behavior was proposed by [Scanlan et al. (1971)] by 
introducing the idea of flutter derivatives that were originally used in aerospace engineering for 
predicting the flutter wind speed.  Because of the bluff body nature on civil bridge sections, the 
flutter derivatives are usually determined by performing wind tunnel identification on section 
models.  The methodology of the conventional approach that basically uses free vibration 
technique has been well developed and widely used in many actual practices.  However, the 
typical shortcomings by this method include (1) the lack of consistancy because free vibration 
responses are quite sensitive to test condition/environment, and (2) the difficulty of performing time 
domain analysis for buffeting responses.  To overcome these, this paper presents a new approach 
for identifying uncoupled flutter derivatives using white-noise forced vibration technique.   
 
2. FORMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
2.1 Equation of Bridge Motion Subjected to Smooth Wind Flow and Forced Excitation 
Consider a schematic diagram of the experimental setup shown in Fig. 1.  The bridge section 
model is connected to the wind tunnel ceiling and a two-axes actuating device outside the wind 
tunnel by four springs.  Under smooth wind flow and forced excitation, if the section model is 
restricted to move in either the pitching (torsional) or heaving (vertical) direction individually, the 
uncoupled equations of motion in both directions can be expressed respectively as 
)(5.05.0 t MLθk θc θkθcθJ ++=++ &&&& 00 lθθθθ 00 lhhhh;  (1, 2) )(5.05.0 tL Lhk hc hkhchm ++=++ &&&&
in which m and J are mass and mass 
moment of inertia w.r.t. the elastic center 
of the section; h and θ  are heaving 
displacement and pitching angle of the 
deck; , , , 
, k and c are spring stiffness and 
internal damping coefficients, r is spring 
location to the elastic center of the deck; 
is section length,  and  are 
motion-induced lift and moment per unit 
length;  and θ  are heaving displacement and pitching angle generated by the actuating device.  
For structural identification, the damping ratio and natural frequency of the individual structural 
system can be identified by complex curve-fitting of frequency response function induced solely by 
the forced excitation from the actuating device.  With the aid of knowing the values of J (or m)

that the acceleration is the representative quantity that directly reflects on the motion perception 
and comfort.  The human perception for wind-induced motion has been a long-time 
controversial issue.  The perception of motion is physiologically determined by the vestibular 
system in the inner ear, however, psychological effect may play a crucial role as well.  Other 
related factors such as body posture, body orientation, motion waveform, task distraction, 
gender, age, visual cue, auditory cue and others, according to earlier research literature, can 
considerably differentiate the outcome.  In these previously conducted researches, some were 
based on the people survey in actual buildings [Hansen et al. (1973), Goto (1983), Jeary et al. 
(1988), Isyumov and Kilpatrick (1996), Denoon et al. (1999), etc.], some used survey data from 
a motion simulator [Khan and Parmelee (1971), Chen and Robertson (1972), Shioya and Kanda 
(1993), Burton et al. (2006), Kwok et al. (2007), etc.].  Because of the complexity of human 
senses on motion perception and comfort, and the influence of different test conditions, some 
papers gave distinctive results while some showed good agreement.  Interestingly, some recent 
researches have even shown strong evidence to confirm on the frequency dependency of the 
motion perception and comfort threshold [Denoon et al. (1999), Burton et al. (2006), Kwok et al. 
(2007)]. 
From the engineer’s perspective, it is the comfort criteria which is related to structural 
design, rather than the motion perception criteria, because the message that structures could 
move under disturbance is supposed to be conveyed to the general public education.  For 
people living in earthquake and typhoon prone region, this understanding is not difficult for 
them, especially adults, because of the personal experience in the past.  It is obvious that 
people require higher level of motion to feel the discomfort.   
In authors’ opinion, even under the same test condition, there are two basic issues that 
need to be addressed before further consensus can be approved.  If the comfort threshold is 
considered as a random variable in the analysis of statistical survey data, the definition of 
cumulative percentage to which the comfort threshold corresponds should be clarified first.  In 
the previous literature, its variation ranges from 2 percentile [Hansen et al. (1973), Kwok et al. 
(2007), Burton et al. (2006)], 10, 50 (median) to 90 percentile [Chen and Robertson (1972), 
Jeary, et al. (1988)].  Secondly, it is also observed that very few articles discussed the 
methodology of determining the return period for the comfort threshold [Hansen et al. (1973), 
Goto (1983)].  The return period, herein means the recurrence period of a given motion that 
people feel intolerable.  In fact, return period is critically important because it is to be specified 
on the mean wind speed for analyzing the structural acceleration in checking the satisfaction of 
comfort. 
Despite of the difficulty in finding agreement, there is an imminent need for practitioners 
to have a comfort guideline for design purpose.  To date, ISO 6897-1984 [International 
Organization for Standardization (1984)] and Japan building wind code [Architectural Institute 
of Japan (2004)] have officially stated the criteria for human comfort.  The ISO 6897-1984 
basically adopted the suggestion in Irwin (1978, 1986) as the comfort criterion, which is defined 
as “not more than 2% of occupants give adverse comments about the motion with a return 
period of 5 years or more”.  The criteria stated in Japan building wind code, however, is based 
on the combined consideration of the criteria proposed in Goto (1975, 1983), Kanda et al. (1988) 
and ISO 6897-1984, with the return period set to one year.  In addition, Australia building wind 
code [Standards Australia/ Standards New Zealand (2002)] referred to the articles of Melbourne 
and Cheung (1988) and Melbourne (1998) for the comfort issue, which are essentially the same 
as regulated in ISO 6897-1984 except using peak acceleration instead.  Tentatively, ASCE the 
2.  Test Chamber: 
A test chamber with a dimension of 2 m (Length) by 3 m (Width) by 1.9 m (Height), 
which is decorated as a study room or living room, was constructed directly on the top of the 
platform as shown in Fig. 2 (a).  The structure of the chamber is designed to be stiff enough to 
avoid vibration from itself during the motion of the simulator.  The space of the test chamber, 
as shown in Fig. 2 (b), can accommodate two test subjects to attend the test simultaneously.  
The chamber is also installed with a window which can be open or closed by blinds, depending 
on if the visual effect is to be taken into account in the test.  Shown in Fig. 3 is a perspective 
view of the overall arrangement of the 2-axes motion simulator, test chamber and other facilities 
in the laboratory.

(fore-apt or side-to-side directions) were not particularly specified as the first round trial.  That 
is, the subjects were free to take the test based on their personal choice, however, those data will 
be still recorded as references.  More parametric studies based on a specific test condition will 
be performed sequentially in the near future.   
Each test lasts for thirty minutes.  Upon completion of each test immediately follows a 
questionnaire survey to record his/her perception on motion and discomfort as well.  The test 
subject needs to answer if he/she perceives a motion, and the reason why he/she has such a 
feeling.  In case that the test subject gives adverse comments, he/she will be also asked an 
opinion about the longest intolerable recurrence period on that event.  For statistical analysis, 
the longest intolerable recurrence period in the questionnaire is divided into five categories: 1 
month, 2~3 months, 4~6 months, 1 year and 2~3 years, which is a multiple choice.  The 
perception levels for motion and discomfort can be thus recorded and distinguished, while the 
concern in our research is mostly placed on the comfort criteria. 
 
ANALYSIS OF COMFORT THRESHOLD 
 
Since the acceleration amplitude in a motion is a quantity that directly reflects on the 
motion perception, it will be used to quantify the comfort threshold in the analysis.  However, 
for harmonic motion with long duration, the comfort threshold is better represented by using the 
acceleration root-mean-square (RMS) value later as was used in ISO 6897-1984.   
Due to the random nature of survey data, the distribution of comfort threshold can be 
statistically analyzed.  It is reasonable to assume the comfort threshold under the same 
frequency is a random variable that follows the probability density function (PDF) of a 
lognormal distribution expressed as [Chen and Robertson (1972), Shioya and Kanda (1993)]

in which the random variable X represents the comfort threshold; x is an acceleration amplitude; 
λ is the mean value of ln X; ς is the standard deviation of ln X.  Therefore, in the survey data, 
the percentage of test subjects giving adverse comments is corresponding to the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) of X equal to  
∫=< ∞−a  X dx  xf aXP )()(   (2) 
in which a is the given acceleration amplitude.  The percentage of test subjects giving adverse 
comments from our survey data is listed in Table 2 for each frequency.  These data will be best 
fit into the CDF in Eq. (2) by using numerical minimization technique from which the two 
parameters λ and ς can be determined.  The resulting values of λ and ς in each frequency case 
are listed in Table 2, while the curve-fitted CDFs of the percentage of test subjects giving 
adverse comments for each frequency case are shown in Fig. 4.   
As adopted in ISO 6897, herein the comfort threshold is set at where 2% of the test 
subjects give adverse comments.  Hence, in each frequency case, the assignment of )( aXP <  
equal to 2% leads to the value of comfort threshold.  Their values in terms of acceleration 
amplitudes and RMS are tabulated in the 2nd and 3rd columns of Table 3. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS OF RETURN PERIOD 
 
The analysis of the return period is based on the survey data of intolerable recurrence 
period.  In the survey data, the five categories of the longest intolerable recurrence period: “1 
month”, “2~3 months”, “4~6 months”, “1 year”, and “2~3 years” are corresponding to five 
categories in terms of the lowest intolerable recurrence rate: “4~6 times in a year”, “2~3 times in 
a year”, “less than once in a year”, and “once in a year”, respectively. 
By assuming that the probability of a given motion occurring in a year follows the 
Poisson process, the probability of such an event occurring i times in a year can be expressed as

where ν is the mean occurrence rate in a year, which is related to the return period R by R=1/ν.  
Furthermore, by assuming that the percentage of people objecting is a random variable, the 
expected percentage of people objecting can be calculated by the formula expressed as [Hansen

exponential function, as shown in Fig. 5.  Thus, the return period corresponding to the comfort 
threshold can be obtained by interpolating or extrapolating the curves in Fig. 5.  The tentative 
results of the return periods for comfort thresholds are shown in the last column of Table 3.  
Although the values seem to be quite close to one year, they are not yet conclusive at this 
moment. 
 
COMPARISON WITH ISO 6897-1984 
 
The tentative results of comfort threshold in terms of acceleration RMS are plotted in 
Fig. 6 for comparison with ISO 6897.  Two solid curves in Fig. 6 are the thresholds proposed 
by ISO 6897, one is the original curve for return period equal to 5 years, another one is the curve 
for return period equal to 1 year by multiplying 0.72 as suggested in ISO 6897.  The 
comparison at the moment is to see the general trend, more conclusive remark will not be made 
until more data collection from continuing survey are completed in the future.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
In an attempt to build up the local data base in preparation for improving the Taiwan 
building wind code in the future, this research project aims to conduct surveys to investigate the 
comfort criteria by using a motion simulator newly constructed at the wind engineering research 
center, Tamkang University.  In this preliminary study, the methodology and feasible procedure 
to determine the comfort threshold and the return period for the continuous researches in the 
long run has been constructed.  The tentative results following the procedure were presented,
