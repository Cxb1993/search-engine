1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In this study, the effects of an adjacent inclined rock face on the active earth pressure against a 
rigid retaining wall was studied. In tradition, active earth pressure behind a gravity-type retaining 
wall is estimated with either Coulomb’s or Rankine’s theory. However, if the retaining wall is 
constructed on the side of for a mountainside highway, adjacent to an inclined rock face as shown 
in Fig. 1.1, the nearby rock face might intrude the active soil wedge behind the wall. The 
distribution of earth pressure on the retaining wall might be affected by the presence of the 
inclined rock face. In the design of retaining walls in mountainous area, it is important to estimate 
the magnitude of the active soil thrust and the point of application of the active soil thrust. For 
gravity-type retaining walls, the Rankine’s active failure wedge in the backfill is bounded by the 
wall and the plane with an inclination angle of (45° + φ/2) from the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 
1.1 The nearby rock face may interfere the development of the Rankine’s active failure wedge 
behind the wall. For retaining walls built adjacent to stiff interface, can Coulomb’s or Rankine’s 
theory be used to evaluate the active earth pressure active on the wall? Would the distribution of 
active earth pressure still be linear with depth? The distribution of active earth pressure on 
retaining structures adjacent to an inclined stiff interface is discussed in this report. 
 
1.1 Objective of Study 
 
The NCTU model retaining wall facility was modified to study the effects of an adjacent inclined 
rock face on active earth pressure. A steel interface plate simulating the rock face was designed 
and constructed. A top supporting beam, and a base supporting block were constructed to support 
the steel interface plate. Air-dry Ottawa sand was used as the backfill material. For a loose 
backfill, the soil was placed behind the wall with the air-pluviaiton method to achieve a relative 
density of 35%. The main parameter considered for this study is the rock face inclination angle β 
= 0°, 50°, 60°, 70° , and 80° as shown in Fig. 1.2. The height of the backfill H = 0.5 m. The 
variation of lateral earth pressure was measured with the soil pressure transducers on the surface 
of the model wall. Based on experimental results, the distribution of earth pressure on the 
retaining wall adjacent an inclined interface was investigated. The test results would provide 
valuable information for geotechnical engineers regarding the design of retaining structures near 
an inclined rock face.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Geotechnical engineers frequently utilize the Coulomb and Rankine earth pressure theories to 
calculate the active earth pressure behind retaining structures. Terzaghi (1934), Mackey and Kirk 
(1967), Bros (1972), Sherif et al. (1982), Fang and Ishibashi (1986), Fang et al.(1994) and Fang 
et al.(1997) made experimental investigations regarding active earth pressure. Numerical 
investigation was studied by Bakeer and Bhatia (1989), Fang et al. (1993) and Matsuzawa and 
Hazarika (1996). Frydman and Keissar (1987) used the centrifuge technique to test a small mode. 
The change of pressure from the at-rest to the active condition for a retaining wall near a vertical 
rock face was observed. Fan and Chen (2006) used the non-linear finite element program 
PLAXIS to investigate the at-rest to the active condition for a rigid wall close to a stable rock 
face. 
 
3. EEPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
 
In order to study the earth pressure behind retaining structures, the National Chiao Tung 
University (NCTU) has built a model retaining wall system which can simulate different kinds of 
wall movement. The entire system consists of the following components: (1) soil bin; (2) model 
retaining wall; (3) driving system; and (4) data acquisition system.  
 
3.1 Soil Bin  
 
The soil bin is 2,000 mm in length, 1,000 mm in width and 1,000 mm in depth as shown in Fig. 
3.1. Both side walls of the soil bin are made of 30 mm thick transparent acrylic plates, through 
which the behavior of the backfill can be observed. The end wall that sits opposite to the model 
retaining wall is made of 100 mm-thick steel plates. The bottom of the soil bin is covered with a 
layer of Safety-Walk to provide adequate friction between the soil and the base of the soil bin. 
 
To eliminate the friction between backfill and sidewall, a lubrication layer with 3 layers of 
plastic sheets was furnished for all model wall experiments. The lubrication layer consisted of 
one thick and two thin plastic sheets were hung vertically on each sidewall of the soil bin before 
the backfill was deposited. The thick sheet was placed next to the soil particles. It was expected 
that the thick sheet would help to smooth out the rough interface as a result of plastic-sheet 
penetration under normal stress. Two thin sheets were placed next to the steel sidewall to provide 
possible sliding planes. 
 
3.2 Model Wall 
 
The moveable retaining wall and its driving systems are shown in Fig. 3.1. The retaining wall is 
1000 mm-wide, 550 mm-high, and 120 mm-thick, and is made of solid steel. The retaining wall is

4. VERTICAL INTERFACE PLATE AND SUPPORTING SYSTEM 
 
A steel interface plate was designed and constructed to simulate the inclined rock face near the 
retaining structure as shown in Fig. 1.1. In Fig. 4.1, the plate and its supporting system were 
developed to fit in the NCTU model retaining-wall facility. The system consists of the following 
two parts: (1) steel interface plate; and (2) supporting system. Details of the interface plate and its 
supporting system are introduced in the following sections. 
 
4.1 Steel Interface Plate 
 
The steel plate is 1.370 m-long, 0.998 m-wide, and 5 mm-thick as shown in Fig. 4.2. The unit 
weight of the steel plate is 76.52 kN/m3 and its total mass is 53.32 kg (0.523 kN). A layer of 
anti-slip material (Safety-walk, 3M) was attached on the steel plate to simulate the friction that 
would act between the backfill and rock face as illustrated in Fig. 4.2 (c). A matrix of steel 
L-beams (30 mm × 30 mm × 3 mm) were chosen as the reinforced material for the plate. On top 
of the interface plate, a 65 mm × 65 mm × 8 mm steel L-beam was welded to reinforce the 
connection between the plate and the hoist ring shown in Fig. 4.2 (b). 
 
4.2 Supporting System 
 
To keep the steel interface plate in the soil bin stable during testing, a new supporting system for 
the interface plate was designed and constructed. The supporting system composed of the 
following two parts: (1) top supporting beam; and (2) base supporting block. 
 
4.2.1 Top Supporting Beam 
 
The top supporting steel beam was placed at the back of the interface plate and fixed at the bolt 
slot on the side walls of the soil bin. Details of top supporting beam were illustrated in Fig. 4.3. 
The section of supporting steel beam was 65 mm × 65 mm × 8 mm and its length was 1700 
mm. Fig. 4.4 showed the top supporting beam was fixed at the slots with bolts. 
 
4.2.2 Base Supporting Block 
 
The base block used to support the steel interface plate was shown in Fig. 4.5. The supporting 
block is 1.0 m-long, 0.14 m-wide, and 0.113 m-thick. Fig. 4.5 (b) showed three trapezoid grooves 
were carved on the face of the base supporting block. Fig. 4.6 showed the foot of the interface 
plate could be inserted into the groove at different distance from the model wall. Different 
horizontal spacing d adopted for testing included: (1) d = 0 mm; (2) d = 50 mm and (3) d = 100 
mm. Fig. 4.6 showed 6 pieces of plywood boards were inserted between the base supporting 
block and the end wall to keep the base block stable. Details of base board were illustrated in Fig.

Where δi = interface-plate friction angle (degree), and γ = unit weight of soil (kN/m3). Eq. 5.3 
was applicable for γ = 15.1 ~16.36 kN/m3 only. 
 
5.5 Control of Soil Density 
 
To achieve a uniform soil density in the backfill, dry Ottawa sand was deposited by 
air-pluviation method into the soil bin. As indicated in Fig. 5.1, the soil hopper let the soil 
particles pass through a calibrated slot opening at its lower end. In this study, the drop height of 
1.0 m and the slot opening of 15 mm were selected to achieve the loose backfill with a relative 
density of 35%.

6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
This chapter reports the experimental results regarding effects of an adjacent inclined rock face 
on the active earth pressure against a retaining wall. The loose (Dr = 35%) Ottawa sand with the 
unit weight γ = 15.6 kN/m3 was prepared as the backfill material. Based on direct shear tests, the 
corresponding internal friction angle φ is 31.3o. The γ and φ values were used to calculate the 
earth pressures based on the Jaky and Coulomb theories. 
 
6.1 Distribution of Earth Pressure 
 
The distributions of active earth pressure at the interface inclination angle β = 0°, 50°, 60°, 70° 
and 80° were shown in Fig. 6.1. In the figure, the active earth pressure decreases with increasing 
β angle. It would be reasonable to expect that the magnitude of active soil trust to decrease with 
increasing β angle. For the β angle greater than 50°, the shape of the active pressure distribution 
implied that the point of application of the active soil thrust would not be significantly affected by 
the rock face inclination angle β. 
  
6.2 Magnitude of Soil Thrust 
 
The variation of active earth pressure coefficient Ka,h as a function of interface inclination angle β 
was shown in Fig. 6.2. For comparison purposes, the analytical results reported by Fan and Chen 
(2006) were also plotted in Fig. 6.2. Without the interface plate (β = 0°), the coefficient Ka,h 
values was in fairly good agreement with Coulomb’s prediction. However, with the intrusion of 
the rock face into the active soil wedge, the coefficient Ka,h decreased with increasing rock face 
inclination angle β. Although the tend was the same, the experimental Ka,h was much lower than 
the numerically obtained Ka,h values.  
 
6.3 Point of Application of Soil Thrust 
 
Fig. 6.2 showed the variation of the point of application of active soil thrust with the β angle. For 
the β = 0°, no rock face was near the retaining wall, the (h/H)a value was located at about 0.33H 
above the base of the wall. As the interface angle β increased, the earth pressure measured near 
the base of the wall decreased. This change of earth pressure distribution caused the active total 
thrust to move to a slightly higher location as shown in Fig. 6.3. For β = 80°, the point of 
application of the active soil thrust was located at 0.425H above the base of the wall..

the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) Without the Stiff interface
