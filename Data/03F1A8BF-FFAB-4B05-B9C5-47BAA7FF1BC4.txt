Abstract 
Abstract: One of the main challenges of using 
mobile devices as a learning platform is the 
impermanent network environment due to the wireless 
coverage or wireless link fail. For instance, using 
Pocket PC and WiFi technique user may stay out of 
network area so that the handheld device becomes 
useless for learning. On the other hand, persistent 
connection usually offered by cellular phone with 
telecommunication protocol, but comparative weak 
computing power and very limited network bandwidth 
cause the learning as time-consuming process. Besides, 
the learning contents nowadays composed of various 
multimedia resources that induce the long latency for 
displaying them on handheld devices such as using 
Smarthpone with GPRS.  
This project proposes an adaptive course caching 
strategy based on SCORM Sequencing and Navigation 
to address the problems in the SCORM-compliant 
mobile leaning environment. The system automatically 
switches to the corresponding course caching 
strategies, VMM (Virtual Memory Management) mode 
or COD (Caching On Dish) mode according to the 
current networking capability.

1. Introduction  
Using portable devices to support teaching and 
learning is not a new concept. The widespread of 
wireless infrastructure and rapid adoption of handheld 
computing devices have made mobile learning a reality. 
Recently, the related mobile learning systems are 
widely developed. These works aim at building a 
practical mobile learning environment in which 
students adequately enjoy the mobility of learning. But 
these systems all have the same situation where the 
learners probably move to the area out of network 
connection. The problem usually cases the learning 
functions become disable such as tracing learning 
behaviors, content delivery and data synchronization, 
etc,. Another important issue about this research area is 
conducting the context-aware technique to enhance the 
quality of mobile learning systems. The similar 
concept is also taken account of designing the course 
caching strategy referencing the related context 
information as important parameters.  
On the other hand, GPRS or 3G 
telecommunication protocol offer the persistent 
connectedness of learning. The Table I shows the 
performance of using Smartphone with GPRS to 
browse example courses released by Advanced 
Distributed Learning (ADL). These courses are stored 
in our remote Learning Management System (LMS) 
server. As the Table I shows the average spending time 
are 17.67 seconds and 15.7 seconds to completely 
display a 10.5KB html-based content and a 7.35KB 
html-based content respectively. On the contrary, if the 
same contents had been downloaded before and stored 
at local storage. Only 3 seconds takes to display both 
courses completely as shown in Table II.

In general, the storage capacity of the mobile 
devices which support the mobile learning is 
insufficient to contain all the learning materials. Thus, 
the factor can be applied to influence either the 
numbers of clusters to be preloaded into the mobile 
device or the clusters to be replaced. 
 
2.2.3 The Factors of Learning Record 
Learning record is maintained by a learning 
system when user starts to learn. The type of factors 
are currently most referenced when the course caching 
system needs to replace some no longer used clusters 
for new downloaded clusters.  
There are three factors regarding in this type: 
reference count, last access time and downloading time. 
If a cluster is referenced frequently, it might be more 
needful than the cluster which is seldom to access. And 
if a cluster is read recently or is a new downloaded one, 
it should be dropped later than the other clusters that 
have already existed in the client device for a while. 
 
2.3 The Automata of the Course Caching System 
Fig. 2 illustrates the automata of the caching 
strategy. Generally, the user’s handheld device would 
not be used only as a digital learning platform. The 
available storage capacity should be assigned by the 
users themselves for the course caching operations.  
 
Figure 2.  Automata of the course caching system 
 
The unique initial state receives a student’s 
registered course list (when the student logs into the 
system) and transmits it to the reading state or the 
download clusters state. The details of the other states 
are described below: 
z Reading: When a learner is reading in a predicted 
range of prepared clusters, the machine 
continuously monitors the content being accessed 
belongs to which cluster.  
z Download Cluster(s): The machine transmits to this 
state under the following three conditions: 
 when a new course list is received 
 when the system detects that the learner is 
accessing content that belongs to a 
different cluster 
 when the student selects the content that 
belongs to unprepared clusters due to an 
incorrect prediction. 
z Replace Cluster(s): As long as the clusters are 
stored in the local storage, they are potential 
candidates for replacement. The machine will 
replace the defunct cluster(s) under the following 
conditions: 
 when the size of a sequence of 
downloading course clusters exceeds the 
currently available storage space. 
 when the user manually deletes the clusters  
z Request Stack: The download request, which 
includes related context information, is an 
important parameter that affects the prediction 
results and the caching efficiency. Consequently, 
if the system fails to communicate with the 
remote LMS server due to the unavailability of a 
network connection, the request is queued 
temporarily until the network connection 
becomes available. 
 
3 Experimental Results 
z Criterion of COD mode 
The aim of this mode is to avoid wastage of time for 
displaying content due to limited network bandwidth, 
e.g., wastage that occurs when a Smartphone with 
GPRS is used as the learning platform. Therefore, 
reduction in the latency during the learning process is 
the primary task of this mode. In other words, the 
criterion of this mode is total waiting. 
z Criterion of VMM mode 
This mode mainly addresses the suspending due to 
the intermittent network connection such as using a 
Pocket PC with WiFi as learning platform. Thus, a 
decrease in the frequency of Internet reconnection is 
the criterion of this mode. 
z Five evaluation modes: 
 No caching strategy (NONE) 
 COD with FIFO (first in first out) 
algorithm (COD-F) 
 COD with our algorithm (COD-O) 
 VMM with FIFO algorithm (VMM-F) 
 VMM with our algorithm (VMM-O) 
 
We evaluated the course caching strategy using 
 6
The Fig. 5(a) shows that the COD-O mode 
significantly reduces 29% waiting time better than the 
COD-F mode 15% waiting time. Fig. 5(b) shows the 
VMM-O performance shown an improvement of 57% 
over that of NONE and approximately 6% over that of 
VMM-F. 
 
           
 
       
 
 
 
4 Conclusion and Future Works  
The main contribution of this project is the proposal 
of a course caching strategy to facilitate efficient 
mobile learning systems based on SCORM. Our study 
demonstrates the improvement in difficult network 
situations encountered in a current mobile learning 
environment. The proposed adaptive caching mobile 
system can switch between two caching strategies 
according to the device network capacity. The COD 
mode is designed to reduce the latency in the learning 
process due to the weak computing power and limited 
bandwidth of handheld devices such as Smartphones 
with GPRS. On the other hand, the influence of the 
failure of the network connection can be significantly 
decreased by the VMM mode. Moreover, since the 
result of prediction is important for the entire system, 
we carefully examine some factors to be evaluated 
while carrying out the caching strategy. Thus far, we 
intend to reference more context information to 
increase the accuracy of the hit ratio. The related issues 
would be what types of context information are helpful 
for us and how to retrieve information such as the 
learning history, learning progress, user’s background, 
user’s preference, and user location.

    無 
resource guide as CSCL requires that the student 
take a more active role in his or her own learning 
[10]. [11] states vicarious learning that points out 
the knowledge is formed from others’ experience. 
[12] proposes a concept of distributed 
constructive learning that explains knowledge 
comes from “doing”, not “receiving.” [4] uses 
Blog as a learning tool to be media for tutor 
development, auxiliary teaching, and dialogue. 
The author [1] builds a web-based collaborative 
learning environment via a web-based course to 
indicate that collaborative learning at web-based 
environment may give as good as results as 
classroom learning. 
   However, the weblog has been widely 
accepted in use in e-learning during the past four 
years, it not only provides the personal web 
vision, but also facilitates the command post 
function for learner to provide the opportunity to 
make a discussion with each other [5]. This rapid 
growth reflects attempts to circumvent the 
constraints of centralized authorship [6] and 
increase needs for instant communication on 
knowledge-building community [7], as it allows 
alternative forms of learning, such as 
self-reflection, student-student and student-tutor 
different to the conventional ways. Besides, with 
the concept of Web2.0, the weblog is much easy 
to develop a suitable personal learning interface 
for LMS in order to fulfill the construction of the 
collaborative learning environment. Therefore, 
we propose a LBlog with the integration of 
weblog and LMS to illustrate that the LBlog has 
great potential to become one of the effective 
groupware in collaborative educations. 
 
3. Constructing a Collaborative 
Learning Environment with Learning 
Blogs 
 
According to the features of the weblog, it is 
easy to provide collaborative workspace, where 
the learners can exchange information in a 
synchronous or asynchronous manner and 
support primitive activities and resources in 
collaborative learning, such as dialogue channel, 
shared workspace, technologically mediated 
remote communication, and personal workspace 
[8]. In order to emphasize these characteristics, 
we propose a LBlog integrating with LMS to 
share knowledge or interaction when a learner 
faces a problem that he/she cannot solve, he/she 
can exchange meaningful information. 
First of all, in order to process the 
collaborative learning in the open learning 
workspace, it is very important to find out the 
suitable group members. It consists of two ways 
to manage the searching method. 
z Searching for mentors 
 Searching for course materials: 
browsing members’ blogs and 
realizing their learning statuses and 
interests.  
 Learning goal: utilizing members’ 
learning goal records and course 
scheduling strategy to learn the 
similar knowledge courses. 
z Building study forum: The forum is used 
to construct a more get-together and 
affinity group such that it is easy to the 
same learning goal. 
 Grouping members 
 Scheduling the same goal and time 
 Monitoring each other 
 Displaying status 
 Synchronizing multiple discussion 
 Delivering messages 
 
Personal LBlog architecture 
encompasses two functions-traditional blog 
function and e-learning function. The 
former presents the personal operation and 
interface to exchange and retrieve the 
learning contents. The latter compliments 
the features of the pedagogical learning to 
promote the learners’ interests and to 
motivate their self-learning potentiality. The 
architecture consists of three managers 
shown in figure 1. 
 
z Learning Schedule Manager: 
providing the functions of learners’ 
self-scheduling courses, making the 
learning goals, and then saving as 
XML documents in the blog learning 
database. 
z Learning Process Monitor: 
Monitoring and recording the 
learners’ learning status and behavior, 
including the beginning time, the 
reading ID, and time duration. 
z Learning Note Manager: Notating 
the learners’ experience and thought 
and saving the learners’ IDs and 
courses’ IDs to database. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Personal Learning Blog Framework 
 
In the meanwhile, in order to manage the 
learners’ own blogs, this system provides a 
Learning Object Operation Module to control 
  
554
course information to the related 
students. 
 
Learner/Teacher can utilize the JavaScript 
Call and HTTP method to connect with LMS 
Server, and utilize the SOA and HTML&CSS to 
show the result in the user browser.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. The View and Implementation of the 
LBlog 
 
Figure 5 shows the view and implementation 
of the LBlog. The functionalities of the LBlog 
will be introduced as follows: 
 
1. LMS: MINE LMS2.0 provides Proxy tool 
and Tool Interoperability Runtime (TIR) to 
make communication with exterior tools. 
2. Personalized Calendar Functionality: The 
learner clicks the date of the calendar to 
realize their own courses when he/she 
would like to learn. If the learner has 
arranged the learning courses in advance, 
system can automatically load the courses. 
3. Group mentors: This area shows the name 
list of the mentors and displays if they are 
on-line at the same time. Using the 
hyperlink, the learner is able to visit their 
learning blogs directly. Also, system keeps 
track continuously if there are new learning 
goals or activities, and then notifies to 
learners. 
4. Course representation area: The area shows 
the webpage learning materials, video, or a 
picture. If the learners have interest in these 
courses, they click the button on the right 
corner to collect the courses. 
5. Evaluation area: The learners can browse 
the courses that peers collect. The learners 
also can evaluate them. 
6. Authors: This area shows all of data that 
author have. The learners are able to leave 
messages to authors directly. 
7. Collection area: This area shows all of 
courses that authors collect. These maybe 
are IMS Common Cartridge or video 
courses. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In the case this paper shows that the LBlog 
has been proved to be an efficient environment 
that enables group members to achieve the 
learning goal in a collaborative learning. This 
collaborative learning environment combining 
with MINE LMS2.0 and Web2.0 functionalities 
observes as a very important mechanism for 
motivating students’ continuous communication, 
discussion or participation and sharing their 
learning experiences in the e-learning field.
