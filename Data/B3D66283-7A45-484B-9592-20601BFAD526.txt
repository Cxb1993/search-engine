2.  Abstract 
The transformation of the convexification is vital for solving Generalized Geometric 
Problems (GGP) in global optimization. Björk et al. (2003) proposed that transferring the 
non-convex signomial terms in the GGP as 1-convex functions is the most efficient 
transformation in current convexification techniques. Up to now, there is lacking an efficient 
convexification method based on the concept of 1-convex function to be presented. In this project, 
a novel method is proposed to maximally improve the efficiency of convexification on the 
concept of 1-convex function and to improve the accuracy of linearization without increasing any 
break point and binary variable in the piecewise linear function. Through this novel method, we 
could obtain both excellent solution quality and efficient computing time. In order to demonstrate 
its performance, there were three existing approaches to be compared using four numerical 
examples. The computational results showed that in terms of solution quality and computation 
time the proposed method has an advantage over the others.

1.  Introduction 
Generalized Geometric Problems (GGP) was first introduced by Passy and Wilde (1967), and 
Blau and Wilde (1969) to solve negatively signed monomials of geometric programming (GP) 
formulations in important engineering models. For the three decades, the GGP has been utilized 
in various fields, including heat exchanger network design (Duffin and Peterson 1966), capital 
investment (Hellinckx and Rijckaert 1971), optimal design of cooling towers (Ecker and 
Wiebking 1978), modeling of batch plant (Salomone and Iribarren 1992), smoothing of splines 
(Cheng et al. 2005), digital circuitry (Boyd et al. 2005), etc. The most popular global optimization 
approaches in solving the GGP involves exponential transformation in the signomial term of 
GGP, as developed by Maranas and Floudas (1997), Floudas et al. (1999) and Floudas (2000).  
Li and Tasi (2005) developed a convexification strategy for global optimization with some 
transformation functions. Pörn et al. (2008) proposed a modified exponential transformation 
technique for heat exchanger network synthesis problems by Björk and Westerlund (2002). The 
mathematical formulation of the GGP herein is showed as follows.

In the above methods, each one uses respective transformation methods for the non-convex 
signomial terms ( ,( ) and ( )p w pS Sx x ). The transformations are applied term-wise for all or only

(b) The ET method (Pörn et al., 2008). 
This method is an extended from Maranas and Floudas (1997). Being the reason that exponential 
functions are always convex functions whatever the domain of variables are, and napierian 
logarithm function can easily decompose the signomial function as separated power functions, 
the exponential decompose is vary practice and easy to convexify the non-convex terms. 
However, ET method cannot obtain the best performance in theory due to reason that the 
convexified signomial terms are still not a 1-convex functions. 
(c) The PCT method (Björk et al., 2003). 
This method is based on the concept of power convex functions introduced by Lindberg 
(1981). Björk et al. (2003) proposed a method to measure the quality of transformation and 
suggested that 1-convex function has the best performance over other convex functions. 
Therefore, the convexified signomial terms converted by PCT method are 1-convex functions. 
Unfortunately the solving time and solution quality of PCT method is worse than ET method in 
many scenarios, for instances, example 5 in Björk et al. (2003).  
 
In this project, we will propose a novel method which can achieve the following features. 
(i) Convexification usually use a piecewise technique to transfer a nonlinear function into a 
linear inequalities function set in the process of transformation. The traditional way to 
improve the accuracy of a linearization function is to increase the numbers of break points, 
but doing so causes an undesirable of numerous binary variables. This project proposes a 
novel and simple technique for improving the accuracy of linearization without increasing 
any break point and binary variable. The only factor that affects convexification strategies is 
called β  parameter in this project. Manipulating the valur of β  can accelerate the 
convergence to the global optimum, 
(ii) Maximally improve the efficiency of convexification on the concept of 1-convex function; 
therefore, all of the convexified signomial are 1-convex function, 
(iii) Obtain both the excellent solution quality and efficient computation time.

For any non-convex posynomial function, the resulting function after convexification must 
be a p-th power convex function where 1≤p . The concept of power convex functions gives an 
appropriate indication what convexity they have. In another word, the concept gives what the cost 
transfer )(xf  as a convex function, i.e. that a smaller p  value means a ‘more’ convex 
function )(xf . The measurement of convexity of posynomial function is as follows.

3.  Proposed Efficient Convexification Strategies 
Although the PCT method has been proposed for transferring the non-convex term as a 1-convex 
function, it still cannot achieve the efficiency of 1-convex theory. In practical, the PCT method 
has poor performance than the ET method both the solution quality and efficiency in solving time. 
This section proposed a novel method and strategy which can maximally improve the PCT 
method based on three factors.  
(i) For the quality of solution: improve the accuracy of linearization without increasing any 
break point and binary variable.  
(ii) For the computation efficiency: skillfully convexify the exponents of the power function in 
the posynomial term, and let they more close to 1-convex function.  
(iii) If we can, any non-convex signomial term will be converted as a 1-convex function but at the 
same time do not change the problem more than necessary. 
 7
(ii) The gap of global optimization and the approximation solution as close as possible since the 
constraint set (6)~(7) are tighter.

4.  Numerical Examples 
Example 1 This example is modified from Quesada and Grossmann (1993) which is a simple 
heat exchanger network problem. In the original problem, it contains four linear fractional terms 
in the objective function, but it cannot distinguish the difference of transformation between PCT 
method and the proposed method. Therefore, we modified the object function as a nonlinear 
function which consists of four bilinear terms and adjusted the relative constraints. For the four 
bilinear terms in object function, it is an appropriate and easy enough example for illustrating the 
transformation with IT, ET, PCT, and proposed methods (we call this proposed method as Beta 
method in this project afterward) when all variables in bilinear need to be transformed 
concurrently. The problem is formulated as follows.

with 32r =  are almost close to zero, but the error rate of PCT and IT methods still have 
0.1698%. In this example, Beta method both has the best solution quality and excellent solving 
time than other methods.
