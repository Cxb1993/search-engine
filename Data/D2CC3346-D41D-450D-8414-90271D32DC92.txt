1-1: Buck-Boost PFC and buck-boost integrated converter 
1-1-1. Operating Principles 
The proposed electronic ballast is shown in Fig. 1-1-1 (a).  The front stage, a single-switch two-output integrated 
converter, is an integration of a buck-boost PFC converter and a two-output buck-boost DC-DC converter.  The post 
stage is a low-frequency half-bridge inverter, which is used because it avoids acoustic resonance by driving the MH lamp 
with a low-frequency square waveform.  When the single-switch, two-output integrated converter is operated in 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the key waveforms in a half line period (Tline/2) are illustrated in Fig. 1-1-1 (b).  
The AC input current shaping and lamp-power regulation are controlled by switch S1 with high-frequency pulse-width 
modulation (PWM).  Switches SH and SL are operated at a 50 % complementary duty cycle.  The operating period of 
MH lamp Tlamp is designated by the switching frequency of half-bridge inverter. In the positive half period of Tlamp, the 
switch SL is in the on state and the energy delivered by the integrated converter is transferred to the lamp through the 
low-side output. Similarly, the switch SH is turned on and the energy is transferred to the lamp through the high-side 
output of the integrated converter in the negative half period of Tlamp.  Since the operations of the negative half period 
are symmetrical to those in the positive half period, only the positive half period is discussed.  The simplified circuit of 
the positive half period is shown in Fig. 1-1-2. Also, the key waveforms in one switching period Ts are depicted in Fig. 
1-1-3. In addition, all components are assumed to be ideal, and the lamp is treated as a resistor.  The operating modes in 
one switching period Ts are described as follows. 
A. Mode I: t0~t1 
The switch S1 is turned on at t = t0, the diodes DB1 and DB2 are conducted.  The inductor Lpf and the inductor Lm 
receive energies from input voltage vin and DC-bus voltage Vbus, respectively.  The inductor currents iLPF and iLm are 
increased linearly.  Switch current iS is a summation of inductor currents iLPF and iLm.  In this interval, the lamp energy 
is supplied from capacitor C. 
B. Mode II: t1~t2 
When switch S1 is turned off at t = t1, the diodes Dpf and DL are conducted and the diodes DB1 and DB2 are off.  The 
energy stored in inductor Lpf is released to DC-bus capacitor Cbus.  Also, the energy stored in inductor Lm is released to 
the capacitor C and Rlamp.  The inductor currents iLPF and iLm are decreased linearly.  At t = t2, the inductor current iLPF 
is decreased to zero. 
C. Mode III: t2~t3 
The energy stored in inductor Lpf is zero and the diode Dpf is off in this mode.  The energy stored in inductor Lm is 
released to the capacitor C and Rlamp.  At t = t3, the inductor current iLm is decreased to zero. 
D. Mode IV: t3~t4 
The energy stored in inductor Lm is zero and the diode DL is off in this interval.  The lamp energy is supplied from 
capacitor C. 
1-1-2. Analysis of Single-Switch Two-Output Integrated Converter 
The input current, constant lamp power control, DC-bus voltage, and boundary condition between continuous 
conduction mode (CCM) and DCM of the integrated converter are analyzed as follows.

D. Boundary Condition between CCM and DCM

where Vin,pkmin is the peak value of minimum input voltage, LmB is the boundary magnetizing inductance, and LpfB is the

Current-sensing signal vRs and the voltage-feedback signal are obtained by resistor Rs and a voltage-feedback circuit, 
respectively.  The maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is designed to be higher than the lamp voltage.  
When the lamp is not yet ignited, the maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is limited by the 
voltage-feedback circuit of the UC3843.  When the lamp is ignited, the output voltage of the integrated converter is 
decreased to equal the lamp voltage.  Then, the limitation of current-sensing comparator in the UC3843 will be clamped 
at 1 V, which is the internally clamped threshold of current-sensing signal VR. Thus, the maximum current-sensing signal 
VRs,max is expressed as 
,max ,1 .Rs Lm pk sV I R                                                                     (1-1-26) 
Therefore, peak inductor current ILm,pk can be limited as a constant in order to achieve constant output power for the 
single-switch two-output integrated converter during DCM operation. 
1-1-3. Design Example and Experimental Results 
A. Specifications 
A laboratory prototype is implemented to drive 70W MH lamps.  The main specifications of the proposed two-stage 
electronic ballast are listed below. 
 AC-input voltage vac: 200 Vrms to 264 Vrms, 60 Hz; 
 Switching frequency fs: 50 kHz; 
 Lamp operating frequency: 150 Hz; 
 Ignition voltage pulse: 3 kV. 
B. Design Example 
Considering the operating voltage for 70W MH lamps, the minimum lamp voltage Vlamp,L is to be designated as 70 V.  
Under conditions Vlamp,L = 70 V and Vin,pkmin = 283 V, minimum DC-bus voltage Vbus,min can be determined to be 141 V by 
(1-1-25).  Then, boundary PFC inductance LpfB and boundary magnetizing inductance LmB can be derived by (1-1-24) 
and (1-1-19), as LpfB = 631 μH and LmB = 312 μH.  To ensure that the integrated converter is operated in DCM, Lpf and 
Lm are selected to be 600 μH and 300 μH, respectively.  Next, the peak inductor current ILm,pk can be calculated from 
(1-1-7), as ILm,pk = 3.1 A.  Thus, the current-sensing resistor can be obtained via (26) to be Rs = 0.33 Ω. 
C. Experimental Results 
Fig. 1-1-6 shows the input-current waveform at 220 Vrms, 60Hz AC-input voltage.  The AC-input current is a 
sinusoidal waveform and is in phase with AC-input voltage.  Table 1-1-I shows the high power factor and low total 
harmonic distortion of input current with various AC-input voltages.  The PF is higher then 0.989 and the THD of input 
current is less than 6.8 %.  Table 1-1-II illustrates the comparison between the measured harmonic distortion of input 
current and the IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard; as shown, the measured results satisfy the requirements of the standard. 
Fig. 1-1-7 shows that the igniter provides 3kV high-voltage pulses to ignite the lamp.  The lamp-voltage and 
lamp-current waveforms of Philips CDM-R 70W/830 PAR30L are shown in Fig. 1-1-8 (a) and (b).  As illustrated, the 
lamp is driven by a 150Hz low-frequency square waveform.  The crest factor of the lamp current is about 1.1 in 
steady-state operation.  Fig. 1-1-9 shows the variations in DC-bus voltage Vbus and lamp power Plamp at various 
AC-input voltages. The DC-bus voltage Vbus increases from 150 V to 193 V when the AC-input voltage is raised from 
200 Vrms to 264 Vrms. Lamp-power Plamp is also maintained at nearly 70 W when DC-bus voltage Vbus is varied. In 
addition, to verify the performance of the proposed ballast, various 70W MH lamps are driven at 220 Vrms AC-input 
voltage; the results are listed in Table 1-1-III. Measured lamp powers of various MH lamps at different AC-input

The input current, constant lamp power control, DC-bus voltage, and boundary condition between continuous 
conduction mode (CCM) and DCM of the integrated converter are analyzed as follows.

where Vac,pk is the peak value of input voltage. Since switching frequency fs of switch S1 is much higher than line 
frequency fline, input voltage |vac(t)| can be considered as constant during one switching period Ts. When switch S1 on

where d1 is the duty ratio of switch S1. Input current iac is the average value of inductor current iLpf which is

Equation (2-1-4) indicates that the input current iac is a sinusoidal waveform and is in-phase with input voltage vac, 
based on constant duty ratio d1 and constant switching frequency fs during Tline/2.  Therefore, high power factor and low 
harmonic distortion of input current can be obtained when the boost PFC converter is operated in DCM. 
B. Constant Lamp-Power-Control Method 
Lamp power Plamp is controlled by the two-output buck-boost converter. To simplify analysis, it is assumed that lamp 
power Plamp is equal to the input power of the two-output buck-boost converter, which can be expressed as

Equation (2-1-5) indicates that lamp power Plamp can be controlled at a constant level when the peak inductor current

converter.  So, the operations of both buck-boost converters are designed for DCM in the single-switch two-output 
integrated converter. 
C. DC-Bus Voltage 
DC-bus voltage Vbus can be obtained by equalizing average input power Pac,avg and lamp power Plamp over Tline/2. The

Current-sensing signal vRs and the voltage-feedback signal are obtained by resistor Rs and a voltage-feedback circuit, 
respectively. The maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is designed to be higher than the lamp voltage. 
When the lamp is not yet ignited, the maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is limited by the 
voltage-feedback circuit of the UC3843. When the lamp is ignited, the output voltage of the integrated converter is 
decreased to equal the lamp voltage. Then, the limitation of current-sensing comparator in the UC3843 will be clamped at 
1 V, which is the internally clamped threshold of current-sensing signal VR. Thus, the maximum current-sensing signal 
VRs,max is expressed as 
,max ,1 .Rs Lm pk sV I R    ( 2 - 1 - 1 4 ) 
Therefore, peak inductor current ILm,pk can be limited as a constant in order to achieve constant output power for the 
single-switch two-output integrated converter during DCM operation.

Fig. 2-1-3 shows the input-current waveform at 220 Vrms, 60Hz AC-input voltage. The AC-input current is a 
sinusoidal waveform and is in phase with AC-input voltage. The lamp-voltage and lamp-current waveforms are shown in 
Fig. 2-1-4. As illustrated, the lamp is driven by a 150Hz low-frequency square waveform.  The crest factor of the lamp 
current is about 1.1 in steady-state operation. The DC-bus voltage Vbus increases from 176 V to 516 V when the AC-input 
voltage is raised from 90 Vrms to 264 Vrms. Lamp-power Plamp is also maintained at nearly 70 W. The lowest and highest 
lamp power levels are 66.32 W and 72.33 W, respectively. The average lamp power is 69.325 W, and the variation of 
lamp-power is within ± 4.22 %. Fig. 2-1-5 shows the overall efficiency of the proposed electronic ballast at different 
AC-input voltages. The lowest and highest efficiency levels are 81.08 % and 85.86 %, respectively.  
2-1-4. Conclusions

topology is constructed of a single-switch two-output integrated converter and a half-bridge inverter.  The input current, 
constant lamp power control, DC-bus voltage, and boundary condition are analyzed.  Also, a simple control circuit is 
presented for the two-stage electronic ballast.  A 70W laboratory prototype is implemented with 90 Vrms to 264 Vrms 
AC-input voltage, and various 70W MH lamps are driven to verify the performance.  The ballast achieves high power

VRs,max is expressed as 
,max ,1 .Rs Lm pk sV I R    (2-2-15) 
Therefore, peak inductor current ILm,pk can be limited as a constant in order to achieve constant output power for the 
single-switch two-output integrated converter during DCM operation.

B. Experimental Results 
Figure 2-2-3 depicts the measured vac and iac waveforms at 200 V input voltage in the steady state; it shows that the 
input current is in-phase with the voltage. The highest PF is 0.955 at 200 V and the lowest PF is 0.949 at 264 V. Figure

power Plamp is also maintained at nearly 70 W when DC-bus voltage Vbus is varied. Measured power of the MH lamp at 
different AC-input voltages is illustrated in Fig. 2-2-7. The lowest and highest lamp power levels are 66.32 W and 72.33 
W, respectively. The average lamp power is 69.33 W, and the variation of lamp-power is within ± 4.33 %. Figure 2-2-8 
shows the measured efficiency of the proposed ballast with utility-line input voltage at 200~264 V. The lowest and 
highest efficiency levels are 83.46% and 85.32%, respectively. 
2-2-4 CONCLUSIONS

Which indicates that the input current iin is a sinusoidal waveform and also in-phase with input voltage vin, based on 
the constant duty ratio d1 and constant switching frequency fs during Tline/2. Therefore, high power factor and low 
harmonic distortion of input current can be obtained when the SEPIC PFC converter is operated in DCM. Lamp power 
Plamp is controlled by the two-output buck-boost converter. To simplify the analysis, it is assumed that lamp power Plamp 
is equal to the input power of the two-output buck-boost converter, which can be expressed as

Equation (3-1-8) indicates that lamp power Plamp can be controlled at a constant level when the peak inductor current 
ILm ,pk and switching frequency fs are maintained at constant levels in DCM operation of the two-output buck-boost 
converter. So, the operations of both buck-boost converters are designed for DCM in the single-switch two-output 
integrated converter. 
DC-bus voltage Vbus can be obtained by equalizing average input power Pin,avg and lamp power Plamp over Tline/2.

So the minimum dc-bus voltage Vbus,min can be determined by designating the peak minimum input voltage Vin,pkmin

3-2-1. Operating Principles 
The proposed electronic ballast is shown in Fig. 3-2-1.  The front stage, a single-switch two-output integrated 
converter, is an integration of a flyback PFC converter and a two-output buck-boost DC-DC converter.  The post stage 
is a low-frequency half-bridge inverter, which is used because it avoids acoustic resonance by driving the MH lamp with 
a low-frequency square waveform.  When the single-switch, two-output integrated converter is operated in 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), the key waveforms in a half line period (Tline/2) are illustrated in Fig. 3-2-2.  
The ac input current shaping and lamp-power regulation are controlled by switch S1 with high-frequency pulse-width 
modulation (PWM).  Switches SH and SL are operated at a 50 % complementary duty cycle.  The operating period of 
MH lamp Tlamp is designated by the switching frequency of half-bridge inverter. In the positive half period of Tlamp, the 
switch SL is in the on state and the energy delivered by the integrated converter is transferred to the lamp through the 
low-side output. Similarly, the switch SH is turned on and the energy is transferred to the lamp through the high-side 
output of the integrated converter in the negative half period of Tlamp.  Since the operations of the negative half period 
are symmetrical to those in the positive half period, only the positive half period is discussed. The simplified circuit of the 
negative half cycle is shown in Fig. 3-2-3. Also the key waveforms in one switching period Ts are depicted in Fig. 3-2-4.  
In addition, all components are assumed to be ideal, and the lamp is treated as a resistor. The 
operating modes in one switching period Ts are described as follows. 
A. Mode I: t0~t1, Fig. 3-2-5(a): 
The switch S1 is turned on at t = t0, the diode DB1 is conducted. The inductor Lpf1 and the inductor 
Lm receive energies from input voltage vin and DC-bus voltage Vbus, respectively. The inductor 
currents iLpf1 and iLm are increased linearly. Switch current iS is a summation of inductor currents iLpf1 
and iLm.  In this interval, the lamp energy is supplied from capacitor C2. 
B. Mode II: t1~t2, Fig. 3-2-5(b): 
When switch S1 is turned off at t = t1, the diodes Dpf1 and D2 are conducted and the diode DB1 is 
off. The energy stored in inductor Lpf1 is released to DC-bus capacitor Cbus. Also, the energy stored in 
inductor Lm is released to the capacitor C2 and Rlamp. The inductor currents iLpf1 and iLm are decreased 
linearly. At t = t2, the inductor current iLpf1 is decreased to zero. 
C. Mode III: t2~t3, Fig. 3-2-5(c): 
The energy stored in inductor Lpf1 is zero and the diode Dpf1 is off in this mode. The energy stored 
in inductor Lm is released to the capacitor C2 and Rlamp. At t = t3, the inductor current iLm is decreased 
to zero. 
D. Mode IV: t3~t4, Fig. 3-2-5(d): 
The energy stored in inductor Lm is zero and the diode D2 is off in this interval.  The lamp energy is supplied from 
capacitor C2. 
3-2-2. Analysis of Single-Switch Two-Output Integrated Converter 
The input current, constant lamp power control, DC-bus voltage, and boundary condition between continuous 
conduction mode (CCM) and DCM of the integrated converter are analyzed. To simplify the circuit analysis, the 
following conditions are assumed.  
1) The turn ratios of the coupled inductor is n = Np/Ns. 
2) The primary side and secondary side of the PFC inductors equal to the value of Lpf.

E. Control Scheme 
The control circuit of the proposed two-stage electronic ballast is shown in Fig. 3-2-7. A current-mode PWM 
controller (UC3845) is used to control the single-switch two-output integrated converter. A half-bridge driver (IR2153) 
is used to control the half-bridge inverter. The dead time between the gate-driving signals of the half-bridge inverter are 
internally set at 1.2 μs by the IR2153. 
Current-sensing signal vRs and the voltage-feedback signal are obtained by resistor Rs and a voltage-feedback circuit, 
respectively.  The maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is designed to be higher than the lamp voltage.  
When the lamp is not yet ignited, the maximum output voltage of the integrated converter is limited by the 
voltage-feedback circuit of the UC3845.  When the lamp is ignited, the output voltage of the integrated converter is 
decreased to equal the lamp voltage.  Then, the limitation of current-sensing comparator in the UC3845 will be clamped 
at 1 V, which is the internally clamped threshold of current-sensing signal VR. Thus, the maximum current-sensing signal 
VRs,max is expressed as 
SpkLmRS RIV  ,max, 1 . (3-2-26) 
Therefore, peak inductor current ILm,pk can be limited as a constant in order to achieve constant output power for the 
single-switch two-output integrated converter during DCM operation. 
3-2-3. Design Example and Experimental Results 
A. Specifications 
A laboratory prototype is implemented to drive 70W MH lamps.  The main specifications of the proposed two-stage 
electronic ballast are listed below. 
● AC input utility-line voltage (vac): 200~264 V; 
● Lamp rated power: 70 W;  
● Lamp rated voltage: 85 V;  
● Lamp rated current: 0.83 A;  
● Switching frequency of the half-bridge inverter: 150 Hz; 
● Switching frequency of the integrated converter;  
● 50 kHz; Igniting voltage of the HID lamp: > 3 kV. 
B. Design Example 
Considering the operating voltage for 70W MH lamps, the minimum lamp voltage Vlamp,L is to be designated as 70 V.  
Under conditions Vlamp,L = 70 V and Vin,pkmin = 292 V, minimum DC-bus voltage Vbus,min can be determined to be 216 V by 
(3-2-25). Then, boundary PFC inductance LpfB and boundary magnetizing inductance LmB can be derived by (3-2-24) and 
(3-2-19), as LpfB = 631 μH and LmB = 312 μH.  To ensure that the integrated converter is operated in DCM, Lpf and Lm are 
selected to be 600 μH and 300 μH, respectively. 
C. Experimental Results 
Fig. 3-2-8 depicts the measured vac and iac waveforms at 200 V, 60 Hz AC-input voltage in the steady state; it shows 
that the input current is in-phase with the voltage. The measured lamp-voltage and lamp-current waveforms are shown in 
Fig. 3-2-9. As illustrated, the lamp is driven by a 150Hz low-frequency square waveform. The highest PF is 0.9921 at 
200 V and the lowest PF is 0.9785 at 264 V as shown in Fig. 3-2-10. Table 3-2-I illustrates the comparison between the 
measured harmonic distortion of input current and the IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard; the measured results satisfy the 
requirements of the standard as shown in Fig. 3-2-11. Fig. 3-2-12 shows the variations in dc-bus voltage Vbus and lamp
