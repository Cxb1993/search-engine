pressure was ~10-9 Torr for the XPS measurements.
Moreover, to investigate the trap states of the HfO2/Si
stacks resulting from the different PDA conditions, the
leakage current density-voltage (J-V) and
capacitance-voltage (C-V) of MIS capacitors were
obtained using Al/HfO2/Si structures. An aluminum
film (~5000 Å) was sputtered on top of the wafers and
patterned as the top electrode, and another 5000 Å of
aluminum was sputtered on the back side to serve as the
ohmic contact. The J-V and high-frequency (1 MHz) C-V
values were measured using an Agilent 4284A precision
LCR meter and an Agilent 4155C precision
semiconductor parameter analyzer in a dark chamber at
room temperature.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Physical Properties of HfO2/Si Stacks
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional TEM
micrographs of the HfO2/Si stacks after PDA in N2 for
several different durations (5 ~ 25 min). Figure 2 shows
the cross-sectional TEM micrographs of the HfO2/Si
stack after PDA in O2 (95% N2+25% O2) for several
different durations (5 ~ 25 min). The HfO2 films
retained an amorphous structure after PDA treatment.
For bulk Si, Si diffusion and the formation of an
amorphous interface layer (IL) at the HfO2/Si interface
seemed to occur during growth of the HfO2 films.
However, there was a clear difference between the
microstructures of the HfO2 films after the PDA in pure
N2 and O2. The HfO2 film with PDA with O2 for different
durations showed no significant effect on IL thickness.
However, the HfO2 film with PDA with N2 for 5 min had
a thicker IL, whereas the HfO2 film with PDA for 25 min
was composed of a thinner IL compared to that of the
HfO2 film with PDA for shorter durations. This result
suggested that migration of physisorbed oxygen in the
HfO2 into the interface may occur during PDA
processing. The HfO2 films with either a longer
duration of PDA or PDA in oxygen had improved
interface layers (ILs). This improvement may be
attributed to the annealing converting suboxides at
interface into stoichiometric SiO2, leading to improved
interfacial qualities. According to the TEM EDX
profile, it is likely that the diffusion of oxygen into the Si
substrate occurred during annealing after taking into
account the possible roughness of the interface. Further,
it was found that the concentration of oxygen in the HfO2
/Si interface was decreased after this treatment.

density characteristics (J-V) of MIS capacitors with PDA
in O2 annealed at 600 °C for 5 ~ 25 min.
The leakage current density of HfO2 films with
PDA in N2 or O2 were characterized and are shown in Fig.
11. In O2, the average leakage current density of HfO2
samples with longer PDA durations was found to be
much lower than that of HfO2 samples with shorter PDA
durations; therefore, the leakage current can be improved
by PDA treatment. However, in N2, the samples
showed similar leakage current densities. The improved
densification of HfO2 and the formation of IL after PDA
are responsible for the reduced leakage current densities.
The high-k film can produce an interfacial layer (IL)
between the film and substrate, and this IL retards the
charge transport path within the film. As a gate
dielectric, amorphous films are desirable because the
polycrystalline film can induce fast impurity diffusion
along grain boundaries. Unfortunately, most
single-oxide high-k dielectrics, except Al2O3, have been
reported to crystallize at low temperatures (< 600 °C).
