Abstract 
The observer-based iterative learning hybrid 
tracking control problem for analog neutral 
systems with multiple mixed (discrete and 
distributed) time delays is investigated in this 
project. A continuous-time linear quadratic cost 
function is considered as a performance index of 
the closed-loop hybrid neutral system. A newly 
intelligent-based tracking control framework, 
which is called the improved-type hybrid iterative 
learning control (ILC) scheme, is presented to find 
a low-gain observer-based iterative learning digital 
tracker. To obtain good tracking performance, a 
novel approach that combining the chaos 
evolutionary programming method and the high 
gain property is proposed to search the optimal 
weighting matrices to achieve the “best” tracking 
control for the first time. Finally, a numerical 
example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of 
the proposed methods. 
 
Keywords: Iterative learning control, Tracking 
control, Neutral system, Chaos evolutionary pro-
gramming. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Many practical systems are characterized by 
continuous-time dynamic equations, since digital 
computers and digital processors possess very de-
sirable features of higher reliability, lower cost, 
smaller size, faster speed, greater flexibility, and 
usually better performance, it is often desirable to 
control analog systems by using digital controllers, 
where the resulting digitally controlled analog 
system is a hybrid system consisting of a continu-
ous plant and a discrete controller. Thus, the op-
timal hybrid tracking control problem for analog 
neutral systems with multiple mixed time delays is 
formatted and studied in this project. It is shown 
that most ILC researches have been focused on 
continuous-time dynamic systems, and the devel-
opment of ILC for discrete time systems has been 
restricted to linear systems [1]. Furthermore, the 
ILC methods can combine with adaptive control 
[2], model predictive control [3], and system iden-
tification [4]. The use of optimality criteria in ILC 
also been introduced by many researchers in the 
past [5]. However, to the best of our knowledge, 
most of these algorithms still work only for linear 
dynamical systems, and the ILC method combined 
with intelligent-based linear quadratic optimal

Due to a limited length of the project, some ma-

Furthermore, by utilizing the Newton center in-

to handle the inter-sampling signals in (4). We can

B. Implementation of Iterative Learning Digital 
Tracker 
From the above derivation, the optimal iterative 
learning virtual control input  can be ob-
tained. Comparing (9) with (11) and using (10), if 
we set

the previous results can be used on the finite-stage 
discrete-time regulation control problem for find-
ing the optimal iterative learning virtual controller

In many practical systems, some states may not 
be available, we firstly need to design an 
augmented digital state observer to reconstruct the 
state ( )dZ kT
) ,
 in (8). By utilizing the principle of 
duality [17] and the prediction-based digital re-
design method [18], the augmented digitally re-
designed observer for analog neutral system 
(1a)-(1b) can be obtained, as

CEP and high gain property is capable of obtaining 
an optimal digital tracker and can improve the 
tracking performance. The control scheme of the 
improved-type hybrid iterative learning controlled 
neutral system is shown in Fig. 1. The

is | ( . Then, the per-
formance index for the hybrid controlled neutral 
system versus the number of iterative learning tri-
als are shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, we can see that 
the minimum performance index is met much faster 
with about 35 basis functions. Thus, we can obtain 
the steady-state optimal control law by merely us-
ing 35 conjugate basis 
functions. The output trajectories for tracking the pr
escribed reference input signals with respect to the 
three digital trackers, the newly proposed 
CEP-based IL digital tracker, the IL digital tracker, 
and the conventional optimal digital tracker, are 
shown in Fig. 3. The results of optimal weighting

digital tracker, which is equipped with low-gain 
property and without losing the pre-specified 
high-quality performance in the continuous domain, 
is superior to the IL digital tracker and the con-
ventional digital tracker. That is, the novel 
OBILDT-CEP algorithm can really achieve the 
best tracking performance and improve the input 
saturation problem.
