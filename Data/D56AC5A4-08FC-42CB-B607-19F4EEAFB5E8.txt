Abstract—Using the finite element analyses, this paper discusses 
the effects of temperature-dependent material properties on the stress 
and temperature fields in a cracked metal plate under the electric 
current load.  The practical and complicated results are obtained when 
the temperature-dependent material properties are adopted in the 
analysis. If the simplified (temperature-independent) material 
properties are used, incorrect results will be obtained.
Keywords—Joule heating, temperature-dependent, crack tip, 
finite element.  
I. INTRODUCTION
UE to the electric current load and Joule heating effect, the 
electric current density concentration at the crack tip 
induces a local high temperature area in a cracked metal plate. 
However, a local melting region around the crack tip may be 
produced when the electrical energy is applied enough.  
Under high current density and temperature at the crack tip, 
the heat source may cause a melting crack tip such as a heat 
affected zone (HAZ). During the cooling process, the melting 
material returns to the solid state and the crack sharp tip may 
disappear. A circular or elliptical hole, like a drilled hole, can 
be produced at the original crack tip after cooling [1-3]. 
Furthermore, the hole can arrest the crack propagation. In 
addition, the compressive stresses around the crack tip due to 
the temperature difference also retard the crack growth [1,2]. 
Like a crack repair method, this crack-arrest technique as 
shown in Fig. 1 can be used to control the crack growth in the 
aircraft and structural engineering [1]. 
In early studies, it has been reported that the Joule heating 
effect can induce local compressive thermoelastic stresses and 
melting area at the crack tip arresting crack propagation [4,5]. 
Using analytical methods, the cracked conducting plate and 
shell under an electric current have been studied in [6,7]. The 
most Joule heating concentration was shown to occur around 
the crack tip. Also, the Joule heating density became highly 
oscillatory along the crack due to thermal buckling under 
specific conditions [6,7]. In addition, the finite element 
analyses and results of electric current-induced stresses at the 
crack tip in conductors can be found in [8]. The

electromagnetic and thermal stresses were obtained by the 
coupled-field analyses in their paper.  
Experiments have reported that crack tips can melt under 
high electric current loading and a crack tip hole occurs after 
the subsequent cooling process [2,3,9]. From metallographic 
results in [3], it has been found that a typical fine phase 
transformation microstructure can be obtained in the crack tip 
region as a result of rapid heating and cooling. The intensity, 
ductility and wear capacity around the crack tip were promoted 
[3]. 
Fig. 1 Crack-arrest technique [1]  
 Based on the previous study in [1], this paper discusses the 
effects of temperature-dependent material properties on the 
stress and temperature fields in a cracked metal plate under the 
electric current load. The finite element software ANSYS [10] 
is adopted for solving the problems. The direct current (DC), 
alternating current (AC) and crack contact conditions will also 
be considered. The stress field and crack tip temperature will be 
obtained for estimating the crack tip behaviors. 
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The configuration of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 2. A 
metal plate with a central crack is subjected to a remote stress 
V0 and an electric current I0. This thin plate is made of mild 
steel with dimensions 2Wu2L and small thickness e. The crack 
length is 2a.

displacement, temperature, electric potential, force, heat flow

matrices M, C, Ct, Ctu, K, Kt, Kut and Kv are the structural

The coupled heat flow matrix Q contains the effects of the 
thermal loading and electrical Joule heating. Ctu and Kut are
thermoelastic coupled terms. Eq. (7) is a directly coupled 
nonlinear equation which is solved using the Newton-Raphson 
iterative method. Eqs. (2)(7) will be solved using the finite 
element software ANSYS [10].

in the transient thermal analysis, all surfaces of the plate are 
assumed to undergo adiabatic processes [1,8].  
On the crack surfaces (a<x<a, y=0), the electrical-thermal- 
mechanical contact conditions with contact parameters will be 
considered in the numerical simulations. The following

IV. FINITE ELEMENT MODEL 
The finite element model of the previous study [1] is also 
adopted in this paper. The accuracy of the mesh has been 
validated in [1]. Fig. 3 shows the finite element mesh of 
ANSYS with W=L=0.05 m and a=0.01 m. Due to the symmetry 
of the problem, only a half plate of Fig. 2 is analyzed and the 
symmetric conditions are applied on the model. The plate is 
modeled by ANSYS element type: PLANE223, i.e. the 8-node 
isoparametric plane element with the thermo-electro-structural 
coupled-field analysis. The plane stress option is used due to 
the thin thickness. The nodal degrees-of-freedom of 
PLANE223 are ux, uy, T, and I. In Fig. 3, the model has 1822 
elements and 5353 nodes. The quarter-point elements (QPE) 
[16] are used for modeling the r1/2 singularity at the crack tip. 
In this study, the length of QPE along the crack denotes b and
the ratio b/a=1/40.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Electric Current Density and Temperature Field near 
Crack Tip 
In this case, the following dimensions of the plate are 
considered: W=L=0.05 m, a=0.01 m and e=0.001 m. The DC 
I0=25000 A and remote stress V0=10 MPa are used. Also, the 
temperature-dependent material data in Table I are adopted in 
the analysis. 
As a result in Fig. 4, it shows the electric current density 
vectors near the crack tip at t=0.050169 s. Due to the opening 
condition of the crack, the vectors can not pass through the 
crack surfaces. It is noted that there is a field concentration at 
the crack tip. Similar to the elastic stress field, the electric 
current density also has the r1/2 singularity at the crack tip 
[1,2,8].   
In Fig. 5, the electric current density Jy in the y-direction 
performs the singular phenomenon near the crack tip (x=0.01
m). This curve performs irregular shape due to the temperature- 
dependent material data. 
At the crack tip, the Joule heating effect causes a high 
temperature area. Fig. 6 shows the temperature contour in the 
crack

B. Crack Tip Temperature  
In this section, the DC or AC is used. The numerical results 
from the temperature-dependent material data are compared 
with those from the temperature-independent material data. 
The later one uses the material constants at 21qC in TABLE I. 
In Fig. 9, it shows the effects of temperature-dependent 
material properties on the crack tip temperature under I0=22000
A. When the temperature-dependent material data are used, the 
crack tip can melt after t=0.045 s. On the contrary, the crack tip 
cannot melt if the temperature-independent material data are 
used.
In addition, Fig. 10 shows similar results under the AC load 
which is )120sin(22000)(0 ttI S  A. The frequency of AC is 60 
Hz.

C.  Stress Field  
In Fig. 11, it shows the effects of temperature-dependent 
material properties on the stress Vy under I0=22000 A. The case 
with simplified (temperature-independent) material data 
performs larger compressive stress near the crack tip (x=0.01
m).   It can be seen that the compressive stresses occur in the 
front of the crack tip. It will retard the crack growth.

VI. CONCLUSION
 Using the finite element method, this paper has discussed 
the effects of temperature-dependent material properties on the 
stress and temperature fields in a cracked metal plate under the 
electric current load. At the crack tip, the Joule heating effect 
causes a high temperature area or melted region. The practical 
and complicated results are obtained when the temperature- 
dependent material properties are adopted in the analysis. If the 
simplified (temperature-independent) material properties are 
used, incorrect results will be obtained.
