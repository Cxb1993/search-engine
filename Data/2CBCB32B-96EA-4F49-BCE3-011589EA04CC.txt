atomic force microscopy (AFM) was firstly 
used to measure and compute the dislocation 
densities in Mg-In co-doped GaN films.  
Secondarily, the conducting atomic force 
microscopy (C-AFM)6-12 and scanning 
surface potential microscopy (SSPM)13-19 
were applied to image surfaces’ electricity of 
Mg-In co-doped GaN films over dislocations.  
The nano-scale imaging does allow us to 
learn better about the lighting system of GaN 
semiconductor, which is constructive and 
useful when it comes to improving the 
fabrication processes components. 
  
III. Experimental Set-up and Sample 
Description 
  Experiments were performed under 
ambient conditions using a commercial AFM 
(Dimension 3100, Digital Instruments).  
Rectangular Si tips (CSC12, NT-MDT, 
Russia) with a spring constant of 1.75 N/m 
and resonant frequency of 155 kHz were 
used for these measurements.  The tips were 
pre-coated with a Cr layer, provided by the 
manufacturer, and subsequently coated with 
a 10 nm Au film by ion sputtering.   
The C-AFM procedures employed in our 
studies have been described previously.6-8  
In brief, a conductive tip is used in contact 
mode AFM scanning for simultaneous 
topography and current measurements.  A 
positive bias voltage is applied to the sample 
through electronics in the AFM while the tip 
is grounded.  The current through the tip is 
measured with a current amplifier and is 
recorded as a function of tip position.  The 
resulting current images show 
nonuniformities in sample conductivity. 
The SSPM is used to image variations in 
contact potential difference ΔΦ (CPD) 
between a conducting AFM tip and sample.  
The CPD is given by 
e
GaNptip −Φ−Φ=ΔΦ           (1) 
where Φtip and Φp-GaN are the work functions 
(WF) of the tip and sample, respectively, and 
e is the magnitude of the electron charge.  
To acquire AFM and CPD images, a 
topographic line scan is first obtained by 
tapping mode AFM imaging, and then the tip 
traces over the same line at a lift height from 
sample surface.  During this ‘lift-mode’ 
scan, AC voltage with a DC offset is applied 
to the conducting AFM tip.  The AC 
voltage frequency is set to resonant 
cantilever free vibration frequency.  The 
oscillation amplitude of the cantilever is 
zeroed by adjusting the external DC voltage 
until it matches the surface potential.  The 
required DC voltage follows the localized 
contact potential of the surface and is 
recorded by the computer with reversing sign.  
The CPD images, which can be related to 
changes in the sample’s surface Fermi level 
position, are thereby obtained. The basic 
principles of SSPM have been described in 
detail elsewhere.13-19  
The samples used in this study were 
fabricated by a low pressure metal-organic 
chemical vapor deposition (LP-MOCVD).  
A 0.3 　m low-temperature GaN nucleation 
layer was first deposited on a 2-inch sapphire 
(0001) substrate at 520℃ followed by ~2 
　m of Mg-In co-doped p-type GaN grown 
at 1110 ℃ .  Electronic grade 
trimethylgallium (TMGa), ammonia (NH3), 
bis-cyclopentadienylmagnesium (CP2Mg), 
and trimethylindium (TMIn) were used as the 
Ga, N, Mg, and In source precursors, 
respectively.  In an attempt to investigate 
the isoelectronic effect of In on the p-type 
GaN, a series of samples were prepared by 
using constant CP2Mg flow rate of 250 sccm 
(25.5 　mol/min) and various TMIn flow 
rates from 0 to 500 sccm (0 to 
0.590　mol/min).  It must be noticed that 
the TMIn diluted with hydrogen was used to 
give an In/Ga concentration ratio of ~0.2% in 
the film. 
 
IV. Results and discussion 
Results and data of the experiment are 
stated and discussed hereunder in three parts.  
Firstly, surfaces of the specimens were 
scanned using AFM and the change of 
dislocation density was analyzed.  Secondly, 
and thirdly, current and CPD images of the 
film surface were then be analyzed using 
C-AFM and SSPM respectively to conduct 
analysis on local electrical conductivity and 
work functions.

p type GaN films (a) with CP2Mg flow rate of 250 
sccm and (b) with CP2Mg and TMIn flow rates of 250 
sccm. 
 
Fig. 4(a) shows the change of contact 
currents at three localized areas as a function 
of TMIn flow rates.  Contact currents inside 
dislocation (curve B) and at smooth areas 
(curve C) exhibit a tendency of progressive 
increase along with the increase of In doping 
concentration.  The largest gradient is 
obtained from the dislocation core, 
particularly near the dislocation rim (curve A) 
where carriers seriously accumulate.  Such 
area of high conductivity is formed by 
quantum confined effect yet with lower 
breakdown voltage which tends to result in 
leakage currents of components under 
normal operation.  For electronic 
components, these are the most vulnerable 
areas to overheating.  Fig. 4(b) displays the 
correlation between mean current densities 
and TMIn flow rate.  The mean current 
density here is calculated from a C-AFM 
scanning area of 1x1 　m2.  The result 
implies that the mean current density of p 
type GaN goes up abruptly when the flow 
rate ratio of TMIn/CP2Mg is greater than 1.  
Based on the analysis stated above, such high 
rise of current density should result from the 
increase of dislocation number and does not 
benefit component efficacy.

(3) Work function (WF) distributions 
The CPD mapping was made in the "lift 
mode" at a lift scan height (tip-sample 
separation) of 30 nm with 5 V AC voltage 
applied to the tip.  The measurement was 
obtained simultaneously with the topography 
scan in the tapping mode using an 
electrically Cr/Au-coated tip.  The 
topography (left) and CPD (right) images of 
the Mg doped and Mg-In codoped (TMIn 
flow rate = 250 sccm) GaN films in a 200 × 
200 nm2 scanning area are shown in Figs. 5(a) 
and 5(b), respectively.  The DC offset
