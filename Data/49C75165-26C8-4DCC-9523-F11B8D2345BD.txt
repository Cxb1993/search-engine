Abstract 
 
Recently, hybrid rocket research has attracted 
tremendous attention for several research institutes 
around the world, mainly because of its inherited 
high degree of safety, simplicity, green propulsion 
and good ISP, which results in relatively low 
development cost. Nevertheless, the hybrid 
propulsion subsystem is still one of the most 
important subsystems, which determines the rocket’s 
performance in general. Since nitrous oxide is self-
pressurized, unlike LOX or others that requires 
complicated cryogenic pumping system, we have 
chosen commercially available nitrous oxide and 
HTPB as the oxidizer and fuel, respectively, in the 
proposed study. In addition, aerodynamics 
optimization of a rocket is also important subject, 
which is addressed in this proposed subproject. Thus, 
in this final report, we report our progress of this 
project in the 2-year period. Firstly, we have 
successfully developed a single-stage, single-port 
hybrid propulsion subsystem with a mixing enhancer 
for ground and real flight test with thrust of ~300 kgf. 
Secondly, we have explored preliminarily the 
complex cold and reacting flow phenomena caused 
by the patented vortex clustering mixing enhancer 
through parallel 2D, 3D CFD simulations. Thirdly, 
we have also built up the aerodynamics database for 
fin-body configuration (single stage) using 
component building up model. 
 
Keywords: hybrid rocket propulsion, computational 
fluid dynamics, combustion, aerodynamics. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
Hybrid rocket propulsion applies both solid and 
liquid as the propellants, instead of solids or liquids. 
In a typical hybrid rocket system, the mixing of the 
liquid oxidizer with solid fuel is controlled by an 
oxidizer valve between their storage tank and 
chamber, respectively. Albeit some similarity exists 
between hybrid rocket and solid or liquid rocket, the 
principles of operation is totally different. In solid 
and liquid rockets, both fuel and oxidizer are 
 4
a second-order backward difference scheme was 
employed to discretize the temporal terms. Details of 
the numerical algorithm can be found in Ref’s [3-9]. 
An extended k-ε turbulence model [10] was used 
to describe the turbulence. A modified wall function 
approach was employed to provide wall boundary 
layer solutions that are less sensitive to the near-wall 
grid spacing.  Consequently, the model has combined 
the advantages of both the integrated-to-the-wall 
approach and the conventional law-of-the-wall 
approach by incorporating a complete velocity profile 
and a universal temperature profile [11]. A finite-rate 
chemistry chemical reaction mechanism [12-18] was 
used to describe the combustion process occurs inside 
the hybrid combustion chamber.  
 
Figure 1 N2O thermodynamic data. 
 
In order to make analyses of phase change 
phenomena commonly occurs in combustion devices 
such as cavitation, liquid sprays and/or cryogenic 
fluid flows, real-fluid thermal and caloric equations 
of state (EOS) were developed for use with the 
present CFD code. The HBMS equations of state [19-
21] were chosen for this purpose. Thermal and 
caloric equations of state, vapor pressure, heat of 
vaporization, surface tension, and transport properties 
are modeled with the equations of state proposed by 
Hirshfelder, et al [22] (we term these the HBMS 
equations of state) and with conventional correlations 
[23], for the other properties.  The property 
correlations used were not chosen for their absolute 
accuracy, but for their validity over a wide range of 
temperatures and pressures and for requiring a 
minimum of data to describe a particular species.  
These correlations are explicit in density and 
temperature. These equations are not only of 
sufficiently high order that properties are accurately 
predicted for a wide range of conditions, but 
component submodels may be easily modified. In 
this instance, the vapor pressure curve and the liquid 
phase density correlations were improved over the 
original HBMS formulations. Other equations of state 
were considered, but were found to be not as 
satisfactory as the HBMS equations. Figure 1 shows 
the phase diagram of N2O. 
 
Multi-component mixtures were treated, by 
adding partial specific volumes or pressures. The 
partial volume methodology is essential to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction when a small amount of 
multi-component vapor and a large amount of liquid 
are present at the same point. The fluid property 
routines also include correlations for the transport 
properties. 
In practical implementation, a real-fluid HBMS 
model based on a time-saving look-up table is used 
following a recently published book by one of the co-
PIs (Dr. Yen-Sen Chen) [24] 
In the present numerical investigation, 
N2O/HTPB combustion conditions are of interest. A 
reduced 12-species and 16-step reaction chemical 
kinetics mechanism [25] is employed for the 
combustion simulation. Note HTPB is simplified as 
C4H6 since it constitutes major part of the HTPB. 
 
2.2 Numerical Method for Aerodynamic 
Design Analysis 
 
Component Build-up Method for Aerodynamics 
Database  
The component build-up method (CBM) is a 
combination of theoretical, semi-empirical and semi-
analytic techniques. This method is a balance 
between configuration applicability, accuracy, and 
usage cost. The component build-up method of 
DATCOM developed by USAF has been proven to 
produce acceptable preliminary missile and rocket 
design accuracy for more than 80% of the 
configurations and flight conditions examined [26-
27]. We will employ this CBM to build up the 
database for rocket aerodynamic configuration design 
as required in the proposed study, which are 
described as follows. 
The CBM separates the rocket aerodynamic 
coefficients into the summation of related 
components. For example, the overall lift coefficient 
can be written as (e.g., single stage, body-fin 
configuration) 
3.  Results and Discussion 
 
 
3.1 Cold Flow Simulation of Hybrid Motor 
with a Mixing Enhancer 
Figure 5 shows the sketch of model hybrid motor 
with a mixing enhancer positioned at the inlet of 
single port. Figure 6 shows an explosive view of the 
grids near the mixing enhancer used for CFD 
modeling. In order to simplify the grid generation and 
reduce the total number of cells, I-blanking method 
was used to generate the mesh of vane, although this 
may not follow the exact geometry of the vane, which 
we think it will influence the overall structure the flow 
field too much. Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the planned static-
burn test configuration of the hybrid combustion.

and mounted on the test stand Figure 6 The clustered mixing enhancer near the inlet

and angle of attack (α). 
High pressure transducers are used to measure 
the instantaneous pressure of N2O vapor in the N2O 
tank and hybrid combustion chamber (both pre- and 
post-). K-type thermocouples are used to measure the 
instantaneous surface temperature of N2O tank and 
the temperatures at various positions at the surface of 
the motor chamber. All the above sensors and signal 
control for on/off of the valves are connected to a 
data acquisition system (cDAQ 9172, National 
Instruments Inc.) and then the data are output into a 
laptop computer. The DAQ software was 
programmed using LabView libraries. In addition, 
Figure 4 shows a photo of hybrid combustion 
chamber made of stainless steel mounted on the test 
stand. 
 
To characterize the mixing in the combustion port 
due to the clustered mixing enhancer following 
earlier study [35], we calculate the average of 
magnitude of axial vorticity (ωx) as

In addition, ratio of transverse to streamwise kinetic

computed as

the peak value that is smaller than that those 
presented in Figure 14(a) appearing on the tip at the 
downside. We expect those downstream regions at 
the solid fuel surface behind the large axial velocity 
gradients would be burned faster with a larger 
regression rate. Figure 15 shows that observed 
burned HTPB fuel surface behind a mixing enhancer 
with eight blades. It clearly shows the experimental 
pattern strongly correlates with what we have found 
from the numerical simulation.

enhancer (both have the same angle of attack). 
Table 1 summarizes the important results from 
different arrangements of mixing enhancers. 
Obviously, the chambers with mixing enhancer(s) 
have the better ISP because of better combustion 
efficiency that means less propellant is needed to 
generate the same chamber pressure. Higher 
combustion efficiency also increases the chamber 
pressure that leads to decrease of the mass flow rate 
of oxidizer (N2O). It results in decrease of O/F ratio 
and becomes more close to stoichiometric ratio.

3.3 Aerodynamic Design Analysis 
 
We have designed a single fin-body 
configuration for rocket system. In addition to the 
diameter that is determined by the size of the motor 
(15 cm), the nose length (40 cm) and the length of 
rocket (2.5-3.5 m), the other important parameters, 
including stabilized fins and geometrical parameter of 
the wing section, leading edge sweep angle, aspect 
ratio, tape ratio, were decided based on the proposed 
method. The idea of designing aerodynamic 
configuration include: 1) Large fineness ratio of body 
to reduce the wave drag during supersonic flight, 
which may increase the starting AOA for boundary 
layer separation in the leeward side because of 
weaker viscous cross flow effect during the subsonic 
flight; 2) Tapered plan form of medium aspect-ratio 
wing (1-2) with modified double wedge fin, which 
can benefit the flight stability and fin structure 
loading, especially the limit of the bending moment; 
and 3) Pre-rolling incidence angle (intentionally tilted) 
for fin to increase the flight stability.  
Figure 13 shows the two different designs of the 
rocket, and the total lengths are 250 cm and 350, 
respectively. Both designs used the same wing 
section configuration: length of fin root is 30 cm, 
length of fin tip is 10 cm and semi fin span is 10 cm. 
Figure 14 shows the plane dimensions of three 
different designs of rocket. Figure 15 shows the zero 
angle of attack drag coefficient with Mach number. 
Figure 16 shows the zero angle of attack lift 
coefficient varies with Mach number, in which the lift 
coefficient shows significant difference from 
subsonic region to transonic region. In subsonic 
region, longer rocket also increases the lift coefficient. 
In the transonic region, lift coefficient doesn’t 
correlate well with the rocket length. Figure 17 
shows the zero angle of attack pitching moment 
coefficient varies with Mach number. In subsonic 
region, longer rocket length will also increase the 
pitching moment coefficient. In the region of 
supersonic flight, the pitching moment coefficient is 
not proportional to the rocket length. Since centre of 
pressure move back, the pitching coefficient 
derivatively increase.

that links between pressure difference (inlet and 
throat) and mass flow rate is written as: 
Figure 23 shows the venturi flow meter 
calibration system, includes a nitrogen pressurized 
source tank with adjustable pressure, a venturi flow 
tube and an orifice. Different tank pressures, with or 
without an orifice at downstream, are used to change 
the flow rate. Solenoid valves and pneumatic ball 
valves are used with extended electrical wires which 
every socket has independent switch, that we can do 
the experiments by remote control. CO2 is used as 
the working gas in this study instead of N2O because 
of their similarity in thermodynamic behavior and 
also large cost saving.  
 
where A1 and A2 are the inlet area and throat area 
respectively. ΔP is the pressure difference between 
inlet and throat, ρox is the density of oxidizer, and 
Cv is velocity coefficient. Figure 22 shows the 
velocity coefficient for the venturi flow meter is 0.96, 
0.97 and 0.91 for mass flow rate range 1~2, 3~8, 
6~12 kg/s, respectively.  
Pressure transducers, differential pressure 
transducer (Figure 24) and thermocouples are used to 
measure instantaneous pressure and temperature. A 
load cell is used to measure the instantaneous weight 
of the pressurized tank during experiments that can 
be used to deduce the instantaneous mass flow rate. 
These data are collected by a data acquisition system 
(NI 9205, NI9213 and NI cDAQ-9172) and a 
personal computer.

Comparison of simulation and experimentsare

Bernoulli equation is fitted to be 0.96 for the flow 
rates as mentioned in the above.
