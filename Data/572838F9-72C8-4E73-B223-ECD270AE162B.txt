關鍵詞: 演算法、省電、流量控制、可調式競爭策略、排程機制、換手機制 
1. 已發表文章(共計二篇國際會議論文及四篇國際期刊論文 IEEE Trans. Vechicular Technology) 
針對目前無線網路存取點，進行系統效能改進的方法。首先於論文附錄A中，基於多媒體設備
在無線網路即時傳輸中，對時間要求很嚴格，現有的無線基地台內的，封包排程機制是以相對應延
遲需求 (the corresponding delay time requirements)，來改善傳輸量和降低延遲時間，這樣的方法
做的不夠好，沒有從多角度思考延遲需求 (deliberating)，導致效果不佳。因此我們提出下載最小延
遲排程演算法(downlink delay-minimized scheduling, DDMS) 來改善現況。 
對於用戶端，省電機制問題的研究，目前研究都趨向於評估封包抵達時間 (the packet 
inter-arrival time) 做省電改善。然而，這些方式無法反映出，傳送資料量與分配頻寬之間關係(the 
traffic load and available bandwidth)，這樣會導致大部分使用者端，省電效果不佳；也就是說很多
傳輸優先等級低的用戶，在無法傳輸時，也必須醒著消耗電源，等待傳輸。因此，於論文附錄B中，
我們同時提出可調式流量控制演算法(adaptive traffic indication algorithm ATIA)，讓使用者不傳輸
時，能在省電模式多睡一會，達到更省電。 
對於車輛內部的無線傳輸環境研究，會用到標準規範(IEEE 802.15.4)，這個環境中，運用重覆
式通道配置方式確保穩定傳輸，卻會照成過多競爭通道的環境，因而導致通道的使用率降低。於論
文附錄C中，提出可調式的競爭策略 (adaptive contention control strategy, ACCS)，來提升通到使
用率。 
對於車輛外部的無線傳輸環境研究，所有封包都必須經由第三層IP比對(IP lookup) [12]，才能
夠找到封包目的地，於論文附錄D中提出跨層的快速傳輸模式(cross-layer cut-through switching 
mechanism, CCSM)。運用系統保留的bit[1],[11]，加以定義設計。讓基地台運用這些定義的bit，就
看的懂內部傳輸的封包，改善寬頻無線網路封包傳輸速度。 
對於車輛無線傳輸的干擾研究，在標準規範中已提供很多種抗干擾方法，但外部external干擾
仍然會對無線傳輸形成很大干擾。於論文附錄E 提出容錯傳輸機制(fault-tolerant transmission 
mechanism, FTM)。在MAC層(medium access control)中，運用拆散傳輸槽(slot)，再緊密重組下載
傳輸欄位(frame)，以達到較高的成功傳輸機率。 
如圖二所示。

2.3. 巨細胞標籤轉換機制(文章已登出如附錄六) 
對於車輛外部的無線傳輸環境和Internet結合研究，當資料需要傳輸到網際網路時，改進無線網
路和多重協定標籤轉換網路(multi-protocol label switching, MPLS)之整合網路[23][24]，封包因為
無法辨識高速網路的標籤，都必須經由第三層IP比對(IP lookup) [12]，才能夠找到封包目的地，提
出於論文附錄[F]中，我們提出巨細胞標籤轉換機制(macrocell label switching mechanism for 
MPLS-WiMAX networks, MLSM)，延伸MAC層表頭(header)中保留的bit。設計成讓基地台看的懂
內部傳輸的表頭，改善寬頻無線網路封包傳輸速度，達到基地台跨層運作加速整合式網路傳輸[25]，
如圖三所示。 
 
圖三. 巨細胞標籤轉換機制傳輸架構 
2.4. 預先協調換手機制(PHM) 
標準規範中IEEE 802.16 提供三種協調換手機制L0，L1，和 L2 [3]，在[4]研究中驗證這三種
換手機制，所需要的換手時間，為 280 ms, 230 ms, 60 ms，而文獻[5]中分析提到，當傳輸延遲時
間小於 50 ms以內，不會造成停格現象；低於 200 ms時，是可以容忍延遲時間；當超過 500 ms
時，會產生一般人都無法接受的停格現象。因此，比較這文獻[4]和[5]，發現現有的換手機制，都
無法滿足即時的資料傳輸需求[6]。所以，我們提出預先協調換手機制(Pre-coordination Handover 
Mechanism, PHM)，主要是以，服務的基地台 (serving base station, SBS) 運用訊號量測
                                       共 19 頁，第 4 頁 
供資料量大且即時性傳輸，是當務之急[17]。傳統隨選視訊方式，都在MS端建立很大的緩衝區，
或延長等待時間等方式來解決，雖然很多學者也運用保存的廣播機制(reverse fast broadcasting 
scheme, RFBS)[18]和分區廣播機制(division-based broadcasting scheme, DBS)[19]來解決。但以
上這些方法還是會，導致需要很大的緩衝區或延長等待時間，尤其是在MS移動時，這些現象就
愈加嚴重。因此我們提出剩餘間再利用機制(remainder arrangement broadcasting mechanism, 
RABM)，藉由傳輸區段(segment)順序重整，加速傳輸區段，管理再播放率(playback ratio)，提
昇機動用戶隨選視訊多媒體傳輸品質，如圖五所示。

IP lookup和CCSM機制。OFDMA frame是 5 ms，採用一個BS和數個MSs使用頻寬(bandwidth, 
BW)10 MHz，PHY mode是 1024 (fast fourier transform, FFT)和(time division duplex, TDD)下
載和上傳比例為 2:1，依據標準規範一個通道(channel)有 35 個次通道(subchannels) ，每個次通
道有 24 個(data symbols)，所以每個MAC-slot 有三個OFDMA symbols。因此，上傳通道為C = 
35 X 24/3 = 280 slots。採用 16-QAM with 1/2 coding調變，每個slot能夠承載 33.5 bytes。

= 0.035, 0.07, 0.2, 0.4。因此隨著封包數目增加( 增加)，T802.16 就會達到滿載 相對的在CCSM

3.2. 容錯傳輸機制 
3.2.1. FTM 模擬環境 
此模擬採用ns-2 simulation模擬器[15]，建立(orthogonal frequency division multiple access, 
OFDMA)的模擬環境[14]，運用時槽和訊息框frame大小(Ns)對傳輸之影響，驗證burst重組和FTM
機制。OFDMA frame是 5 ms，採用一個BS和數個MSs使用頻寬(bandwidth, BW)10 MHz，PHY 
mode是 1024 (fast fourier transform, FFT)和(time division duplex, TDD)下載和上傳比例為
2:1，依據標準規範一個通道(channel)有 35 個次通道(subchannels)，每個次通道有 24 個(data 
symbols)，所以每個下載MAC-slot 有二個OFDMA symbols。因此，上傳通道為C = 35 X 24/2 = 
360 slots。採用六種調變，分別為QPSK with 1/2 coding、QPSK with 3/4 coding、16-QAM with 
1/2 coding、16-QAM with 3/4 coding、 64-QAM with 2/3 coding 和 64-QAM with 3/4 
coding，進行分析和模擬，實驗模擬參數如表二。 
 
3.2.2. FTM 成果與評估 
在圖八中，當裝載 MPDU的時槽數量NB [0, 100]，比較兩個機制的成功傳輸機率，在高傳輸
模組(16-QAM 1/2 coding rate)中，NB小代表著每個burst較大，例如648 bytes為(270 slots/5*12 bytes)
當NB== 5；而NB = 100時burst為比較小的32.4 bytes為(270 slots/100*12 bytes)。所以在低傳輸模組時
要使用較小的burst。當NB較小時有較多調整時槽的空間(機率)，隨著NB增加調整時槽的空間減少，
Ps(Bi)降至0.5 (50%)當NB為20 (270 slots/20X12 bytes = 162bytes). 無論如何當NB增加時，FTM之
Ps(Bi)都維持 0.5以上呈現穩定狀態。雖然傳統的機制之Ps(Bi)一開始會隨NB增加而增加達到0.2 
(20%)當NB為100 (32.4 byes long per each burst)，但不符合實際環境，因為在都會寬頻網路中當NB
為100代表有100移動用戶同時連線傳輸，現實環境中，NB為20–30是比較常用的環境。比較這兩個
機制平均差距為30%，證實FTM比較適合OFDMA傳輸環境，也證實burst數量要保持較小，比較有
利於資料傳輸。 
在圖九中顯示當 Bi  [0, 200]兩個機制Ps(Bi)機率，當 Bi 是20至200時兩個機制都趨於穩定狀
態，當 Bi 是20時FTM最小的Ps(Bi)達到0.47。比較這兩個機制平均差距為30%，主要是因為FTM有
效的時槽管理機制發揮功效，實驗結果驗說明小的 Bi 傳輸時間較少，所以 Bi 不要太大對傳輸較
有利。 Bi 不要大於20 slots大小不要超過整個frame的5% 。 
在圖十中，採用六種調變分析兩種機制Throughput，分別為a. QPSK with 1/2 coding、b.QPSK 
with 3/4 coding、 c. 16-QAM with 1/2 coding、 d. 16-QAM with 3/4 coding、 e. 64-QAM with 
2/3 coding 和f. 64-QAM with 3/4 coding。調變參數如表三，結果如表四整理數據，明顯看出在
QPSK中兩個機制效能相差不大，因為QPSK只需要較低的SNR值就可以傳送時槽，所以看不出機制
的Throughput優劣。雖然後續較高速模組實驗都顯示，FTM優於傳統機制許多，但在最高的模組中，
FTM(或802.16)在64-QAM with 2/3 coding達到11.9(9.8)Mbps，為何最高傳輸模組64-QAM with 
3/4 coding，確只有達到比較低9.8(8.1) Mbps，在通道品質限制實驗中就可以證實，主要因為傳輸
率高到機制來不及配合封包處理，導致Throughput不會隨著最高傳輸模組增加，這說明好的機制要
配合需求運作，才能夠增加效能，而不是提高模組就有高效能。

此研究中運用QualNet 3.9.5 模擬器，建立(orthogonal frequency division multiple access, 
OFDMA)的模擬環境，驗證換手時失敗機率和延遲時間。OFDMA frame是 5 ms，頻譜由 2.40
至 2.46 GHz，採固定式頻寬(bandwidth, BW)10 MHz，PHY mode是 1024 (fast fourier transform, 
FFT)和(time division duplex, TDD)，下載和上傳比例為 2:1，在BS’s 傳輸功率定為 300 mW，相

                                       共 19 頁，第 12 頁 
由圖十四顯示，當使用率ρ由 0 至 1 逐漸增加時，對四種換手機制所造成的延遲時間，延遲
時間愈短代表換手機制愈好。當ρ=0.1 時，預先協調換手機制之延遲時間( )達到 12 ms，而
IEEE802.16 標準規範L0、L0、L0之延遲時間( )是 375, 345, 80 ms，當 在ρ=0.9 時
是 400, 440 ms 就飽合[7]，這是因為傳統機制要執行重新登入和重新再認證等換手步驟，並要和
其他MS競爭搶通信頻道，所以會導致延遲時間較長。反觀預先協調換手機制，事先就做好準備，
所以在系統使用率ρ=1 時， 到 170 ms，達 則 達到 26 ms。以上數據都顯示，預先協調
換手機制不但優於標準規範的三種機制，也能滿足傳輸時間小於 50 ms以內的要求。

Abstract—Due to the strict time constraints, the real-time
(RT) services for multimedia applications in wireless networks
are difficult to deal with as a packet scheduler (PS) schedules
the related packets, and also the system performance of a base
station (BS) mainly depends on the PS policy. So far as our
knowledge, the relatively existing PS schemes arrange the packets
based on the mainly corresponding delay time requirements for
improving throughput, they do not focus on deliberating how
to reduce the delay time of packets efficiently as an important
purpose. From that perspective, we proposed our downlink
delay-minimized scheduling (DDMS) algorithm which increase
the living time of packet for reducing the corresponding delay
time for mobile stations (MSs) as our main contribution plus
improves throughput of a BS. Simulation results reveal that our
DDMS algorithm outperforms from such corresponding living
time, throughput by comparing with the other PS schemes.
Index Terms—algorithm, OFDMA, packet scheduler, queue,
real-time, wireless, WiMAX.
I. INTRODUCTION
The world wide interpretability for microwave access
(WiMAX) developed from fixedness to mobility [1], [2],
[3] has met all the requirements of 4G and is going to
be the important representation of 4G. The technologies of
WiMAX systems developed such adaptive modulation and
coding (AMC) and orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) make it more effective and interfered resis-
tively than 3G. In addition, there is a major tendency towards
increasing capacity in the downlink traffic between a base
station (BS) and mobile stations (MSs): this will be a major
characteristic of 4G wireless networks; therefore, we mainly
research on schedulers for the downlink in this paper.
Multimedia applications in wireless networks are getting
more attention and are in great demand. Especially with real-
time (RT) multimedia services such as video conference, voice
on internet protocol (VoIP), and internet protocol television
(IPTV), they have two common mainly characteristics: 1)
stringent delay time constrains and 2) requiring much traffic to
transmit to the serving MSs. So the required quality of service
(QoS) in the multimedia services is an essential factor and
posing challenging for satisfying MSs. Therefore, how to make

and Prospective Technologies Project” of the Institute for Information Industry
which is subsidized by the Ministry of Economy Affairs of R.O.C.
sure of guaranteed QoS in multimedia WiMAX systems will
be the key to design a packet scheduler (PS) which operates
at the medium access control (MAC) layer.
Nowadays, there are many existing PS schemes designed to
support such data traffic in the current wireless networks, and
we have referred to several PS schemes which commonly used.
The proportional fair (PF) scheduling scheme [4] is widely
implemented in commercial mobile packet networks including
CDMA-1xEV-DO (evolution-data optimized). PF scheduling
is designed to assign a time slot to an MS while the MS’s
channel condition for its achieved current data rate being better
than its average date rate, however, for its nature–not consider-
ing the RT environments, so it is not suitable to be used in RT
services. The modified-largest weighted delay first (MLWDF)
scheduling scheme [5] is modified from the PF scheme, and
it can be used both in CDMA-1xEV-DO with high data rate
(EV-DO/HDR) and in WiMAX systems. The main object of
MLWDF scheme is to maintain the delay of each connection,
that is to say, the weighted delay that MS’s increasing will be
transmitted first basically. And the earliest deadline first (EDF)
scheduling scheme [6] is used for the RT polling services in
WiMAX systems [7], [8] commonly. EDF scheduling scheme
services the sequence of transmitting packets based on their
deadlines, which is efficient; however, it does not consider
that the length of transmitting packets and channel conditions
whether efficiently to make greatly use of the resources of
the system. So generally, these PS RT schemes just deal with
how to schedule RT packets in time while satisfying the QoS
requirements, not deliberate on how to increase the living time
of packets for reducing the corresponding delay time of RT
packets in the connections of MSs before the corresponding
delay time constraint requirements exceeding in BS.
In this paper, considering supporting the RT services of QoS
in mobile WiMAX systems, we need to consider not only link
adaptation techniques such as AMC at the physical (PHY)
layer, but also the occupying resources of packet length at
the MAC layer while designing our proposed PS scheme. The
goal of our proposed scheme is to determine how to rearrange
the sequences of transmitting packets without violating the
corresponding delay constraint requirements for reducing the
delay time while increasing the living time of packets and
how to make efficient use of system resources for improving
with partitioning into 2 cluster. Hence, there are 48 data
subcarriers within one OFDMA-slot, mbi,j depending on the
modulation levels has the different capacities of transition
bit (2 bits/subcarrier for QPSK modulation, 4 bits/subcarrier
for 16-QAM modulation, and 6 bits/subcarrier for 64-QAM
modulation), and cr has 3 types of cording rate – 1/2, 2/3,
3/4. Plus, a packet transmitting to MS ui may require one or
more OFDMA-slots due to AMC. Let ni,k be the number of
required OFDMA-slot by the transmitting the length of packet,
kl, for MS ui and be expressed by
ni,k =
⌈
kl
bi,j
⌉
. (4)
Consequently, each downlink subframe resources has its limi-
tation for serving various MSs and leads the satiated problem
of scheduling packets for trying to improve performance of
system. For example, for RT service conditions, PS scheduling
each packet for MSs has the main limitation, that is,
Br ≥
N∑
i=1
ni,k. (5)
B. The waiting time of packets in a FIFO queue
Suppose that queues for connections of each QoS type flow
to be finite queues which maintain in the BS and to be updated
whenever the connections are assigned the corresponding ni,k
requirements for the packets. Meanwhile, we assume the basic
time unit is one frame duration Tf in this paper. Let Ai(Tf )
present the (integer) number of packets that arrive during Tf
for the connection of MS ui per Tf , and define λi as the
average arrival rate to MS ui which is following Poisson
distribution process. So we can have
E{Ai(Tf )} = λi. (6)
The queues operate on the behavior of sorting basis. Let
k be the corresponding number of putting into the queue for
k = {1, 2, 3, . . . , N}. The basic FIFO that packets are putting
into relative queues in order is according to their arrival time,
and for a packet k whose it living time Tl is defined as
Tl,k ≡ Td,i − Ta,k, (7)
where Td,i is the delay time constraint of the correspond-
ing connection i and Ta,k is the arrival time of packet k,
respectively. Packets which are putting into a queue cannot
violate its Tl, so we need to evaluate the serving time Ts
and waiting time Tw of the packets. With packet k, its
Ts,k is defined as Ts,k = kl/Dr(xi) where Dr(xi) is the
function that corresponding data rate which is achievable for
xi experiencing of MS ui, Di , {Di| sj ≤ xi < sj+1}, and
Tw,k is defined as Tw,k =
∑n−1
i=1 Ts,i. We also need to define
the basic restricted time Tr of packet k for measuring not to
exceed in its Tl,k and it is given by
Tr,k ≡ Tw,k + Ts,k. (8)
If Tr,k ≥ Tl,k, the packet will not be allowed to put into the
queue and be discarded.

C. The relationship of arrival rate and throughput
The traffic arrival and throughput statistics are also main-
tained by BS. Throughput requirements are of the form,
Λi ≈ Ci, ∀i ∈M (9)
where Ci is the long-term throughput for MS ui and Λi is
corresponding arrival rate for the connection. For short-term
traffic arrival and throughput statistics are maintained by BS
for each downlink connections, therefore, the traffic arrival rate
and throughput for MS ui during the present frame time Tp
are given as,
Λi =
Tp∑
Tf=0
Ai, Ci =
Tp∑
Tf=0
ci, (10)
where ci denotes the short-term throughput of MS ui.
D. Analysis of time delay
We model our system model as an M/M/1/N queuing
model [9] shown in Fig. 2 where N presents there are N
packets in a queue for being served and has a finite number
of states. The arrival and service rates are now:
λ(n) = λ, n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·N − 1
µ(n) = µ, n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·N. (11)
We first analyze the saturation probability ps of resources
of each downlink subframe. The upper limitation of Br is
defined as Br < Bd−Bu−Bn−Bb; when Br is not enough
to guarantee each connections, that will lead to the saturation
of resources. So Br is given by
Br ≡ mklΛaTf ≤ (Bd −Bu −Bn −Bb), (12)
where Λa denotes the upper limitation of allowed packets from
the connections which Br can be serviced. Therefore, Λa can
be derived by
Λa ≥ Bd −Bu −Bn −Bb
mklTf
. (13)
From Eq. (13), ps can be derived by P (X > Λa) and is
given by
ps = P (X > Λa) = 1−
Λa−1∑

From Fig. 2, we derive the n-th transmission probability
and express as following:

the principle of this stage. The scheduler should consider not
only the factor of the minimum ni,k with delay constraint of
packets, but also for the buffer overflow in each connection in a
finite state condition. Therefore, Considering Λi and Ci in each
connection is as weight βi and selects ni,k to be transmitted
first. The selecting basis of that in no urgent period is given

where αi is the product of Gi and the time constraint of
each packet. The packet approaching its delay constraint time
will get more chances for being transmitted, and βi mainly
maintains the fair conditions of connection queues which
increase because of relative ni,k being bigger than the other
smaller ni,k in the other queue connections that not are
scheduled in. Algorithm 1 presents the detailed descriptions
of DDMS in the PS scheme.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this simulation section, we assume that the available
resource for Br which is totally occupied 60% of the system
resources, the other 40% of the system resource is used by
Bu, Bn and Bb, and there are total 60 MSs receiving the RT
packets from their relative connection and there are two types
which are video and voice traffic as the RT data packets in
the cell within one BS. Each type with the connection of MSs
has its own different corresponding delay constraint, and the
packets from the server to the BS have different time passed;
for the required good QoS delay and the corresponding data
packet volume are given following by:
• video: Td ≤ 150ms, 320-1200kb,
• voice: Td ≤ 40ms, 64kb.
The each MS ui’s SNR value, xi, is in the range of (0 . . . 25)
dB and the SNR values change as they are changing positions
with time varying. We also assume the packet arrival rate λi
is 0.5 for per frame. Plus, for AMC, the parameters of the
OFDMA system are as shown in Table I. We also assume that

there are 7 levels of AMC rates in our OFDMA system shown
in Table II [2], [12].1
We let total 60 MSs divide into two sets equally; one set
is for their video transmission, and the other set is for their
voice transmission. Fig. 3 shows the analysis of the mean
time delay comparing in the different number of MSs in the
system that using the proposed DDMS scheme. Obviously, we
see the more MSs, the larger time delay in the queues while
traffic load increasing. Therefore, while traffic load is high,
the quality may be reduced.
We compared our proposed DDMS with EDF, MLWDF
schemes. Fig. 4 illustrates the comparison of average living
time for serving MSs. We can obviously see when the number
of MSs reaches to 5, DDMS and MLWDF are better than
EDF. After that, only DDMS greatly towers over EDF and
MWLDF. Therefore, the figure shows that the PS schemes for
RT services cannot only mainly depend on the order of Tl, but
also need to consider the relationship of Br and ni,k. Plus, the
longer Tl saves, the shorter the delay time we get. The average
Tl of each downlink subframe for serving MSs with DDMS,
EDF and MLWDF schemes is: 1.48ms, 0.39ms and 0.43ms,
respectively.
With throughput of simulation, Fig. 5 illustrates the compar-
ison of throughput in RT connections, and it shows our DDMS

Abstract—The efficiency of power saving mechanism on wire-
less communications will influence the time the mobile stations
(MSs) can operate. Due to the characteristics of centralized
control in WiMAX system, the sleeping period of each subscriber
is dominated by a base station (BS) based on their service types,
traffic loads, and expected sleeping periods. The power saving
mechanism uses an exponential backoff sleeping window manner
to determine the sleeping period of each MS. In recent researches
[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], some of them optimize the sleeping period
by estimating the packet inter-arrival time for improving the
energy efficient. However, those mechanisms do not reflect the
relationship between the traffic load and available bandwidth.
That is, according to the available and priorities of connections,
the lower priority connections can not receive data immediately
and waste energy on the waiting time. Thus, in this paper, we
propose an adaptive traffic indication algorithm (ATIA) to let
MSS do the extend sleep on bandwidth unavailable condition,
and illustrate an adaptively adjusting sleeping window scheme
for delay versus energy consumption. Simulation results show
that ATIA increase the degree of power saving with comparison
to IEEE 802.16e; and further, it shows ATIA can combine with
other power saving mechanism and also get well performance.

I. INTRODUCTION
The IEEE 802.16 working group [1], [2] is originally orga-
nized to develop standards of fixed broadband wireless access
(BWA) technology that provides high-speed, high-bandwidth,
and high-capacity (HHH) broadband wireless access services.
In December 2005, the group released the latest version of
IEEE 802.16e that improves the original standard with mobil-
ity to support mobile stations (MSs) roaming with vehicular
speeds during services. As a part of the mobility extension, it
defines the handoff procedures and sleep mode operations.
In order to effectively manage the limited power, the sleep
mode operations contain three power saving classes (PSCs).
The PSC is defined as a group of connections that have
common demanded properties. All differences by their pa-
rameter sets, procedures of activation, and policies of MS
availability for data transmission. The type I of PSC is recom-
mended for connections of best effort (BE) and non-real-time

R.O.C., under Contract NSC97-2221-E-182-035-MY2 and the “III Innovative
and Prospective Technologies Project” of the Institute for Information Industry

(NRT) service types, and the operation is the exponentially
increment sleep interval. The advantage of type I is better
for saving energy, but causing the long delay becomes the
critical drawback. Unlike Type I, Type II is recommended
for connections of unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time
variable-bit rate (RT-VR) service and uses the constant sleep
interval for adapting real-time traffic. The last one, Type III,
is designed for multicast services.
In recent researches [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], some of them
analyzed the performance of power saving in IEEE 802.16e.
For example, Lei and Tsang [3] analyzed the performance of
Type I and Type II and found out a decision to switch sleep
mode for optimal energy management, but those mechanism
will lose the advantage from the classification of power saving
class. Thus, BS can not use the different sleep type to set the
priority of being awaken. Han and Choi [4] found out the effect
of idle interval and the final sleeping interval by performance
analysis, but they discuss those operational parameter with-
out bandwidth condition. Lee and Bahk [6] think about the
handover occur in power saving would cause consume of cell
searching, and design the adaptive sleep window mechanism.
In their mechanism, they model the MAC state transition by
four states: Adaptive, Power saving, Idle, and Doze. But they
use the connection identification (CID) assignment to represent
the data connection is going that is non-reality. Choi, Lee, and
Cho [7] designed hybrid mechanism for voice over IP (VoIP)
service but such mechanism will cause more and more packet
drop. Another problem is the condition on all silence is too
different that will let their mechanism lack practicality. Kim,
Choi, and Kang [8] adaptive change initial and final sleeping
window base on last sleeping state and correctly measure the
point of awaken, but it will become no use on condition that
bandwidth is unavailable.
In above researches, they always take sleep operation as
an independent mechanism. So they always concentrate on
optimize the mechanism by adjusting sleeping interval or
change sleeping process. Based on IEEE 802.16e standard,
BSs use traffic indication message to wake MS up that stay
at listening interval and has data buffered at BS. After receive
positive traffic indication message, MS would breakup power
saving operation and stay idle until the MS be scheduled.
Because of the above-mentioned, it would confront a big
We note that when i = 0, it indicates that the MS is in S0 and
T0 is a system parameter.

C. MAC Resource with AMC Scheme
Efficient bandwidth utilization for a prescribed packet error
rate (PER) performance at the physical layer (PHY) can be
accomplished with adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)
schemes, which match transmission parameters to the time-
varying wireless channel conditions adaptively. Assume there
are l different AMC modulation levels supported in the IEEE
802.16e PHY. The achievable modulation depends on its
corresponding received SNR value Eb/N0 and denoted as
µi, where i indicates the i-th AMC modulation level and
1 ≤ i ≤ l. Let si be the minimum required Eb/N0 for
achieving the i-th AMC modulation level. Then, the achieved
µi in the i-th AMC level satisfies si ≤ Eb/N0 < si+1 where
si+1 = ∞ for i using the highest level of AMC modulation.
Let µi,j denote the achievable modulation for the i-th MS with
the j-th AMC level and be given by
µi,j , {µj | sj ≤ xi < sj+1} (9)

where xi represents the received Eb/N0 from i-th MS via the
channel quality information channel (CQICH).
According to the achievable µi, each available orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) slot can convey
the corresponding bit rate varies from time by time in downlink
subframe. Let bi denote one OFDMA slot can transmits the
number of bit in µi, and can be represented as
bi = nsNb(i)cr (10)
where ns is the number of used data subcarrier in an OFDMA-
slot, Nb(i) is the bit volume (bits/subcarrier) in µi, and
cr is the selected-correspondingly coding rate. According
to the IEEE 802.16e PHY with PUSC, one cluster has 24
data subcarriers, and one OFDMA slot occupies 2 symbols
with partitioning into 2 cluster. Hence, there are 48 data
subcarriers within one OFDMA slot, Nb(i) depending on the
modulation levels has the different capacities of transition
bit (2 bits/subcarrier for QPSK modulation, 4 bits/subcarrier
for 16-QAM modulation, and 6 bits/subcarrier for 64-QAM
modulation), and cr has 3 types of cording rate: 1/2, 2/3, and
3/4.
III. ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC INDICATION ALGORITHM
The above mentioned PSM uses the MOB TRF-IND mes-
sage to wake up an MS if it is in the PS mode and there is
a traffic for it. Once an MS wakes up from PS mode, the BS
has to allocate bandwidth to the MS for data transmission.
However, when an MS wake up, the energy will be wasted if
there is no available bandwidth for that MS. To avoid this
drawback, we design an adaptive traffic indication (ATIA)
algorithm combined with packet scheduling scheme to reduce
the energy consumption.
First, ATIA separates the operational state S0 into two states
SN and SE . SN represents the normal operational state and
SE represents the extended PS state. When an MS is in SN ,
it can receive data from the BS if there is a bandwidth for it.
Otherwise, the MS will be notified to enter SE for extended
power saving.
A. The Available Bandwidth Allocation
Consider m RT-VR and n NRT connections in the system
and the priority of Crt is higher than that of Cnrt. ATIA
follows the priority order to allocate available bandwidth for
connection usage. Therefore, the available bandwidth BA =
B−BR, shown as Fig. 3, can be used for allocation to Cnrt,
where B is the total bandwidth of the system measured in
OFDMA slots and BR =
∑m−1
i=0 λR(i)`R(i)/bi is the total
required bandwidth of Crt per each subframe.

Fig. 5. Energy consumption among different traffic ratio.
Finally, by summing Eq. (24) and (26), the total energy
consumption can be obtained from Eq. (27).
D. Analysis Result
At first, we observe energy consumption on the condition
that affect by the different ratio of bandwidth requirement
between BR and BN and show it as Fig. 5. When the ratio
as 20:80, BN has more connections can be selected to do
extend sleep, then it will decrease the energy consumption
first. Contrary to high ratio of BN , the high ratio of BR will
decrease the number of connection to do extend sleep. But
when total traffic increase, pA will increase more quickly than
BN has high ratio.
Fig. 6 shows the energy consumption on the different Te.
When the length of Te is short, the decrease of energy
as same as linear. It also show the long Te will decrease
the consumption more quickly when total traffic increase.
Therefore, the long Te can use on the connection that has
more delay tolerance to reduce more consumption.
Fig. 7 shows the affect of the different Tmin on ATIA. When
Tmin equal as 16, each connection will buffer more data when
be awaken. Therefore, it will increase more probability to do
extend sleep when the total traffic load is low.
IV. SIMULATION
In our simulation, we observe the different traffic load
condition to compare our performance under OFDMA system.

An Adaptive Contention Control Strategy for IEEE
802.15.4-based Wireless Sensor Networks
Hsueh-Wen Tseng, Ai-Chun Pang, Member, IEEE, Jenhui Chen, Member, IEEE, Chin-Fu Kuo, Member, IEEE,
Abstract—The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is able to achieve
low-power transmissions in low-rate and short-distance wireless
personal area networks (WPANs). Due to the constitutional
design of the sensor node and transmission architecture (client-
server model), any data communication between two sensor
nodes will involve the coordinator. The shortcoming problem of
redundant channel-access steps will result in excessive contention
overheads and thus the decrease of the channel utilization. This
paper proposes an adaptive contention control strategy (ACCS)
to solve the problem of transmission efficiency in IEEE 802.15.4.
ACCS can be implemented in standard IEEE 802.15.4 medium
access control (MAC) protocol without adding any new message
type. An analytic model and a simulation model are developed
to evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and ACCS. Simu-
lation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly
improves the goodput, average queuing delay, average MAC delay
and the energy consumption.

I. INTRODUCTION
RECENTLY, wireless sensor networks have receivedtremendous attention from both academia and industry.
With the advance of technologies for micro-sensors, wireless
networking and embedded processing, wireless sensor net-
works are now widely tested and deployed for different ap-
plication domains [4], [12]. The existing applications include
environmental monitoring, industrial sensing and diagnostics,
health care and data collecting for battlefield awareness. Most
of the applications are developed by using low-rate, short-
distance, and low-cost wireless technologies. Among the well-
known specifications, IEEE 802.15.4 originally designed for
low-rate wireless personal area networks has become one of
the promising candidates adopted for interconnections between
wireless sensor nodes [2].
IEEE 802.15.4 targets ultra-low complexity, cost and
power for low-rate wireless connectivity among inexpensive,
portable, and moving devices [6]. Based on data-processing
capabilities, two types of devices are provided in IEEE

802.15.4: (1) reduced function device and (2) full function
device (FFD). These devices constitute a network, and a
coordinator equipped with the FFD capability is responsible
for organizing and managing the network. In IEEE 802.15.4,
both star and peer-to-peer topologies are supported. In a
star topology, the communication is established between end
devices and a single central controller (i.e., coordinator). In a
peer-to-peer topology, a device could communicate with any
other devices within its transmission range. Multi-hop routing
is allowed in the peer-to-peer topology, and routing paths could
be dynamically updated. This topology provides more complex
network formations such as mesh networking.
The specifications of the physical (PHY) layer and medium
access control (MAC) layer for IEEE 802.15.4 are defined
in [5]. Specifically, the MAC design of IEEE 802.15.4 follows
the modified carrier sense multiple access with collision
avoidance (CSMA/CA) contention-based mechanism. The de-
tails of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC operations will be elaborated in
the following sections.
Previous work for IEEE 802.15.4 focused on analytical
and simulation modeling for the existing MAC specifications.
Gang et al. conducted simulation-based performance evalu-
ation for IEEE 802.15.4 [2]. In [8], Jelena et al. derived
the probability distribution of access delay and calculated
the throughput of a beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 network.
Zheng et al. [6] investigated whether IEEE 802.15.4 is fit
for ubiquitous networking. Golmie et al. [3] evaluated the
performance of IEEE 802.15.4 for medical applications in
terms of goodput, delay and packet loss. Jelena et al [7]
pointed out bottlenecks in the MAC Layer of 802.15.4 but
only simple solutions were proposed. Sheu et al. proposed
schedule strategy by utilizing inactive period to disperse traffic
load and promoted system performance [13]. However, they
added new control frames which were not compatibility with
IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
Although the performance analysis for IEEE 802.15.4 was
investigated extensively, little work has been done on the
problems of IEEE 802.15.4 transmission efficiency. Many
literatures discussed contention schemes in IEEE 802.3 and
IEEE 802.11 previously, but more accurate contention control
scheme should be used in IEEE 802.15.4 due to the modi-
fied CSMA/CA. The major difference between the modified
CSMA/CA protocol and the original CSMA/CA protocol is
that the sensor node desiring to transmit data actually performs
carrier sensing only when the backoff process is completed.
Owing to the characteristics of blind backoff processes in IEEE
802.15.4, the low channel utilization and the long average
access delay are resulted.

where [Si] represents Step i.
one channel access is for uplink transmission (see Steps 1
and 2 in Figure 1), and the other two channel accesses are
for downlink transmission (see Steps 3 and 4 in Figure 1).
These redundant channel-access steps will result in excessive
contention overheads and thus the decrease of the channel
utilization. Also, such a “indirect” downlink transmission (i.e.,
“Pull” model for data transmission from the coordinator to end
devices) increases the load of the coordinator. In a wireless
sensor network, the coordinator is generally a bottleneck de-
vice, and the increase of the load of the coordinator definitely
leads to the degradation of system performance. Furthermore
in the “indirect” downlink transmission, the receiving device
(i.e., Device A) has to be awake to wait for the data sent from
the coordinator upon receipt of the ACK frame (corresponding
to Data Request in Step 3 of Figure 1). If the coordinator
could not obtain the channel-access right in a short period, the
receiving device would waste its energy to stay in the active
mode for getting the data from the coordinator.
In addition to the above issue for transmission efficiency in
IEEE 802.15.4, a considerable amount of contention overhead
results from iterative backoff operations of a standard IEEE
802.15.4 CSMA/CA mechanism especially when the system
traffic load is heavy. Figure 2 (a) illustrates the backoff flow
for a standard IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA mechanism. When
the data frames A1 and C1 respectively arrive at Device A
and C in the ith superframe, the two end devices randomly
select a backoff time based on CWmin. If the collision occurs
(e.g., due to the same backoff time selected by Device A
and C), the size of the contention window is doubled, and
the contention process is repeated until one of the devices
successfully occupies the channel. As shown in Figure 2 (a),
Device A obtains the channel access in the ith superframe,
and successfully transmits its data frame. Then when the next
superframe (i.e., the (i+ 1)th superframe) starts, the window
size will be reset to CWmin. Suppose that Device A and D
intend to send the frames in the (i+1)th superframe. The two
devices probably select the same backoff time due to the small
CW , and the collision may occur again. When the network
load is heavy, the serious contention could not be resolved
within a narrow backoff window, which leads to the increase
of the number of collisions, and hence the performance
degradation. If a broad contention window is initially used in
the (i+1)th superframe, the collisions could be reduced, and
the devices have higher opportunities to successfully transmit
their data frames. However, when the network load is light, a
large contention window causes the reduction of the network
utilization. Also, the frame transmission delay may be raised

III. ADAPTIVE CONTENTION CONTROL STRATEGY
To solve the problem of transmission efficiency of IEEE
802.15.4, we introduce an adaptive contention control strategy
(ACCS) based on a two-stage approach. In the first stage of
our ACCS, we present a memorized backoff scheme (MBS)
to detect the traffic load of IEEE 802.15.4 networks and to
dynamically adjust the size of the backoff window based on the
network load. Once the network load is considered as a heavy
state by MBS, the second stage of our ACCS a load-aware
packet scheduling scheme (LAPS) to distribute the tremendous
amount of downlink packet transmission to the inactive period.
Figure 2 (b) illustrates the backoff flow for MBS. In this
scheme, the CW value for the successful data delivery in
the previous superframe is recorded to predict the initial
value of the CW for the current superframe. The coordinator
announces the initial CW value for the current superframe
to end devices via the Beacon Frame. In Figure 2 (b),
Device A obtains the channel access in the ith superframe by
using a suitable backoff window, and successfully transmits
its data frame. Then as the next superframe (i.e., the (i+1)th
superframe) starts, the size of backoff window will not be
reset to CWmin. The coordinator informs end devices the
CW value with that Device A successfully transmits its data
frame in the ith superframe . Suppose that Devices A and D
intend to send the frames in the (i + 1)th superframe. The
two devices probably select different backoff times due to a
relatively large CW , and the probability of the data collision

simplicity, the data frame length is assumed a fixed value of
L bytes and the arrival process of frames at a mobile device
forms a Poisson stream with arrival rate λ. Then the network
traffic load is calculated as NλL. In the following subsections,
we analyze G for the MAC implementation of IEEE 802.15.4
and the proposed ACCS scheme.
A. Standard IEEE 802.15.4 MAC Implementation
In the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, each device has to take
a backoff-interval countdown before its transmission. The
average backoff interval denoted as Ib, as shown in Figure 45,
is defined as an interval from the time that a mobile device
attempts to access the channel for a frame to the time that
the device actually transmits the frame over the channel. Let
wi denote the size of contention window (CW) for a frame
transmission in the ith backoff retry, and the basic CW unit is
UBP. By following the IEEE 802.15.4 specification, at most
three times of retry are allowed for a frame. Thus the CW size
of the i-th retry will be wi = min(2iw0, 25) for i = 1, 2, and
3, where w0 = 8. Let Ii,s and Ii,f represent the average time
duration of a successful and a failed channel accesses in the
ith retry respectively. In IEEE 802.15.4, a successful channel
access implies two times of successful CCA operations. If one
of the CCAs is not successfully executed, it is considered that
the channel access for this frame transmission fails. Thus we
have Ii,s = wi/2 + 2TCCA and Ii,f = wi/2 + 3TCCA/2.
Then Ib can be expressed as Ib =∑3
i=0 PS(∆t) {[1− PS(∆t)]}i
[
Ii,s +
∑i−1
j=0 Ij,f
]
, where
I−1,f = 0 and PS(∆t) = e−Λ∆t, and Λ = NλTS is the total
frame arrival rate in the system. Let Nui and N
d
i respectively
denote the numbers of uplink and downlink transmissions
generated in the ith superframe. Nri represents the number
of Data Request frames generated in the ith superframe.
Moreover, the numbers of successful uplink-data, Data
Request and downlink-data transmissions in ith superframe
are denoted as Nui,s, N
r
i,s and N
d
i,s respectively.
Since only uplink transmissions (from mobile devices to the
coordinator) occur in the first superframe (i = 1), Nu1,s can
be derived as TS/(Ib + L + Tack + TACK). The number of
packet arrivals in the first superframe is probably less than
Nu1 . Thus the number N
u
1,s in the first superframe can be

derived as min(Λ, Nu1 ). Let K
r
2 be the number of mobile
stations that the successful uplink transmissions in the first
superframe are destined to. In the second superframe, several
Data Request frames triggered by the uplink transmissions
in the first superframe are issued from the Kr2 mobile devices,
where Kr2 =
∑Nu1,s
n=1 nPn and Pn denotes the probability
that the Nu1,s frames are distributed to n mobile stations. Pn
can be derived as Pn =
[
N !
n!(N−n)!NNu1,s
]∑n
j=0(−1)j(n −
j)N
u

]
. Then Nu2 and N
r
2 are respectively equal to
(N − Kr2)TSλ +
(
Nu1 −Nu1,s
)
and Nu1,s. Here the mobile
stations send the Data Request frames to the coordinator and
expect to receive the download frames from the coordinator,
and do not issue the uplink frames in the same superframe.
Also, Nd2 is equal to

d

u

and Nd2 . Let Y and Z denote Ib + L + Tack + TACK and
Ib + Lr + Tack + TACK , respectively, where Lr is the Data

equal to min

periods is sufficiently large, Nui , N

MAC protocol can be derived as
G =
(Nui,s +N

TS − TB ×R, (1)
where TB represents the transmission time of a beacon frame.
From the results of our analysis against simulation experi-
ments for standard IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, we observe that our
analytical results match the curves of the simulation pretty
well.

and an inactive period. If data can be transmitted in contention
periods, the G of contention periods can be derived from
Equation (1). On the other hand, if the transmission of data
frames can be executed in contention periods and inactive
periods, the goodput GS of contention periods and inactive
periods will be GS =
(
Nui,sL
TS−TB−TI +
Ndi,sL

)
R, where TI
represents the duration time of the inactive period.
The goodput of LAPS is composed of the contentions period
or the contention period and the inactive period depending
on whether collision occurs or not. In order to calculate the
goodput of LAPS, we illustrate a tree structure as shown in
Figure 6. The i represents the depth of the tree, and there are j
= 2i−1 kinds of permutation with the contentions period or the
contention period and the inactive period. The nodes with label
C and C+CF denote the situation of contention periods and
contention periods and inactive periods, respectively. Every
superframe has either a contention period or a contention pe-
riod and an inactive period depending on collision occurrence.
The probability Pi,j denotes the probability the path from the
root node to node (i, j). Let Gi,j be the goodput when the
superframe enters the contention period, i.e., the node with
label C or the contention period and the inactive period, i.e.,
the node with label C+CF. When the number of superframe
periods are sufficiently large, the system goodput will enter
a steady state which can be easily derived via the equation
GLAPS = Pi,1Gi,1 + Pi,2Gi,2 + ...+ Pi,jGi,j .
IEEE 802.15.4 transmits a frame to utilize the basic backoff
scheme. Nevertheless, due to narrowing the wi size and the
inflexibility of backoff adjustment, the transmission of a data
frame will consume a longer Ib. Figure 6 shows a tree structure
to calculate the goodput of ACCS based on LAPS. MBS
dynamically adjust wi value according to the traffic load.
Therefore, the proposed ACCS can obtain a smaller Ib value.
Subsequently, we calculate goodput of ACCS which is
comprised by MBS and LAPS, and therefore the performance
of ACCS can be derived by the analytical results of MBS and
LAPS. The goodput of ACCS is similar to LAPS except Ib.
The Ib value of ACCS can be obtained from the analysis of
MBS and is smaller than that of IEEE 802.15.4. According
to MBS, a smaller Ib value can be obtained. That means that
a frame spends smaller backoff time for successful transmit-
ted. In other words, there will be more frames successfully
transmitted in every superframe.
To validate the correctness of the analysis, we perform
a simple simulation of IEEE 802.15.4 and ACCS to verify
results. We take 10 standard IEEE 802.15.4 devices around
a coordinator in the simulation. The mean length of data
frames is assumed to be 90 bytes and other parameters are
given in [5]. From the goodput obtained from analysis and
simulation experiments of IEEE 802.15.4 and ACCS, it shows
that the difference between the analysis and simulation results
are about 5%.
V. SIMULATION MODEL AND RESULTS
The developed simulation model follows the specification of
IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer [5]. To clearly indicate the power
saving features of the proposed scheme, we adopt a transceiver

Chipcon CC2420 model [1]. The length of data frames are
exponentially distributed with a mean of 1/µ UBP. In addition,
mobile devices will transmit data to other mobile devices
within the same PAN. The mobile stations also transmit data to
internet by coordinator. Transmission data into internet only
utilizes once contention to coordinator without along IEEE
802.15.4 standard. When the internet data transmits into PAN
by coordinator, it uses the transmission procedures of IEEE
802.15.4 to the destination. Without loss of generality, several
assumptions are described as follows. First, all mobile devices
support 250 Kbps transmission rate. Second, the coordinator
is static and located at the center of simulated area6.
In the simulation model, the transmission range of a co-
ordinator is assumed to be 30 meters with a transmission
rate of 250 Kbps. In the simulation experiments, we simulate
a scenario of 20 mobile devices and their initial locations
are randomly assigned within the area. Each simulation run
lasts 320 seconds and each simulation result is obtained from
averaging the results of 10 independent simulations. Each
mobile device maintains a FIFO waiting buffer of 16 frames,
and the mean frame length, i.e., 1/µ, is assumed to be 90 bytes
(e.g., 9 UBPs at the 250-Kbps transmission rate, excluding
PHY and MAC headers). The network load consists of the
uplink transmission (from mobile devices to the coordinator)
and the downlink transmission (from the coordinator to mobile
devices) traffic. When the network load, i.e., Nλ/µ, is less
than 0.3, it indicates the “light” traffic load. On the contrary,
when the network load is greater than 0.7, the situation is
defined as the “heavy” traffic load.
The primary performance metrics are the goodput (G),
average queueing delay (Dq), mac delay (D), and energy
consumption. The G is defined as the ratio of the expected
delivery period of data payload to the totally expected trans-
mission period (excluding control frames, etc.) [11].The Dq/D
is defined the interval between the time that the mobile
station creates/serves the frame and the time that the frame is
successfully transmitted. The energy consumption is defined
as the energy consumption per transmitting a frame to the
destination successfully.
Figure 7 shows the effect of ACCS, MBS and IEEE
802.15.4 on goodput for different traffic load. The figure

tion peer-to-peer WPAN.

to dynamically adjust the size of the backoff window based
on the network load. Once the network load is considered
as a heavy state by MBS, the second stage of our ACCS a
load-aware packet scheduling scheme (LAPS) to distribute the
tremendous amount of downlink packet transmission to the
inactive period. Our proposed scheme can be implemented
in the standard IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol without adding
any new message type. An analytic model was developed to
evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and ACCS, which
has been validated against the simulation experiments. Simula-
tion results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly
improves the goodput, average queuing delay, average MAC
delay and the energy consumption. Therefore, ACCS is a
simple and efficient approach for enhancing IEEE 802.15.4
protocol in wireless sensor networks.

Cross-Layer Cut-Through Switching Mechanism for
IEEE 802.16d/e Wireless Networks
Jenhui Chen, Member, IEEE, and Chih-Chieh Wang, Student Member, IEEE
Abstract—This paper proposes a fast cross-layer cut-through
switching mechanism (CCSM) for supporting media access control
(MAC) layer packet switching in IEEE 802.16-based broadband
wireless access (BWA) networks. The local traffic, which means
subscriber stations (SSs) communicating with each other within
the cell, can be switched via the MAC layer without involving
the network layer. The average access delay of request from SSs
is studied and analyzed in this paper. Finally, the simulation
and numerical results show that the performance of CCSM is
superior to that of the legacy IEEE 802.16d/e protocol.
Index Terms—Cross-layer, MAC, network, switching, wireless.
I. INTRODUCTION
ALL PACKETS in computer networks are first looked upto find their destinations in the network layer for packet
relaying/forwarding. In IEEE 802.16d/e [1] wireless networks,
the base station (BS) is used as a role of router/gateway to
process packets from/to Internet to/from its subscriber stations
(SSs) or mobile SSs (MSSs) [2]. This mechanism, however,
will cost a lot of overheads even if the traffic is local, i.e.,
SSs communicate with each other within the coverage area
of a BS. The local traffic will greatly degrade the system
performance when the transmitted data is heavy. To avoid
this problem, the packets, which are destined for Intranet, i.e.,
local traffic, can be switched in the medium access control
(MAC) layer without disturbing the network layer during the
IP lookup process as shown in Fig. 1. All packets (referred
to frames) can be efficiently switched in the MAC layer if a
cross-layer switching mechanism is adopted. In this paper, we
point out this problem and propose a cross-layer cut-through
switching mechanism (CCSM) to offer a fast data-link layer
switching in the IEEE 802.16-based wireless network.
The CCSM uses the reserved bits of the MAC header
specified in the IEEE 802.16 standard to identify whether the
transported data is in the outgoing traffic or in the turnaround
traffic, i.e., the traffic from one SS to another SS inside the
service range of the BS. This traffic can quickly go through
the MAC layer if it can be identified by the BS. According to
the transfer connection identifier (TCID) and some indication
bits, which are specified in the MAC header [1] of each

review of this letter and approving it for publication was P. Demestichas.

Fig. 1. The process of two-stage cut-through switching mechanism.
MPDU transmitted from the SS, the BS can maintain a label1
switching table for frames switching in the MAC layer. The BS
can quickly determine the next hop TCID for data transmission
and examine its corresponding service flow ID (SFID) for the
quality-of-service (QoS) scheduling. By doing so, the local
traffic can be efficiently transferred in the local area network
(LAN) without interfering with the network layer, and thus
enhance the system performance.
II. CROSS-LAYER CUT-THROUGH SWITCHING
MECHANISM
The CCSM uses two reserved bits of the generic MAC
header called the i-bit and s-bit to notify the BS for layer
2 frame switching operations, where i-bit is used for Internet
or Intranet traffic indication and s-bit is used for the request of
cut-through switching forwarding or new entry establishment
for this connection. First, if the traffic is outgoing, i.e., to
the Internet, the SS will send these packets with a TCID and
set the i-bit as 0. As the BS receives the burst data, it will
be notified by the i-bit that these packets are outgoing and
thereby deliver them to the higher layer, e.g. the convergence
sublayer (CS), for unpacking or defragmentation operations
and further IP lookup. Otherwise, this traffic is local and will
be transferred by label switching.
When the traffic is local and transferred for the first time,
e.g., an SS within the cell, the is-bit shall be set as 10. It means
that the burst data with the TCID has not been set up yet in
the label switching table. The BS, then, will forward the data
to the network layer for IP lookup and create a TCID (source)
to TCID (destination) mapping record in the label switching
table for switching usage. Afterward, the SS can send data to
the same destination with coded is-bit as 11. When the s-bit is
set as one, it means that the TCID mapping record has been
built up and the following data will be switched directly. The
SS will keep this TCID as a reference for the destination MAC
address.
1The term ‘label’ corresponds to the TCID in this paper.

reach infinity. On the other hand, CCSM will not be confined
by the number of packets (different ℓ) because the streaming
data will target to the same destination and look up IP once
and then it will be switched in the MAC layer. Obviously, as
shown in Fig. 2, 𝑇802.16 is twice as long as 𝑇CCSM in each
case. CCSM is suitable for the real computer networks since
the statistical average packet size is only about 50–150 bytes
(ℓ = 2 to 4) long [7], while the legacy 802.16 suffers a longer
delay for IP lookup.
It is an interesting observation on the access delay between
𝑇802.16 and 𝑇CCSM as 𝑁𝑠 increases in size. Fig. 3 illustrates the
influence of different 𝑁𝑠 = 66, 132, 264, 528 per request on
𝑇802.16 and 𝑇CCSM (528 slots/frame ≈ 28.4 Mbits/sec) when 𝜌
increases. The detailed corresponding parameters are shown in
Table I. First, as shown in the figure, both 𝑇802.16 and 𝑇CCSM
increase as 𝜌 increases. There is no doubt that when 𝜌 is high,
congestion could happen in both the legacy routing mechanism
(IEEE 802.16) and the proposed CCSM. However, CCSM can
achieve higher performance than legacy IEEE 802.16 can do
not only in average access delay (the half access delay of IEEE
802.16 in each case) but also in heavy traffic condition that is
CCSM can remain a stable 𝑇CCSM until 𝜌 ≈ 0.8, while 𝑇802.16
approaches infinite when 𝜌 ≈ 0.4. This is because CCSM
uses a simple yet powerful mechanism to enable the router
to identify the first packet in a flow and then just prescreen
the remaining packets and bypass the routing and queueing
stages. This mechanism especially fit the flow-based IEEE
802.16 protocol because the mechanism use a cross-layer and
a label switching approach in MAC layer to efficiently shorten
the IP lookup processing time. Results also show that CCSM
can efficiently process most frequently used data streaming
transmission activities in modern computer networks.

V. CONCLUSIONS
The IEEE 802.16 BS plays an important role as a gateway
to Internet or Intranet for SSs. To solve the problem of the
congestion and delay of data transmission, we propose a cross-
layer (layer 2 and layer 3) switching mechanism named CCSM
by studying its performance and comparing to the legacy IEEE
802.16 protocol under different conditions. This approach
would boost throughput, reduce packet loss and delays, allow
new capabilities like fairness controls and, what’s better, it
would save power, size, and cost. Simulation results show that
CCSM outperforms the legacy IEEE 802.16 either in small
or large packet sizes or even in huge multimedia streaming
conditions. What is more, this mechanism can also be further
extended to WiMAX networks and be used to connect multi-
protocol label switching (MPLS) backbone networks.

of which are against internal interference and frequency
selective fading [8–10]. Therefore IEEE 802.16e
WMANs standard and the digital video broadcasting
return channel terrestrial proposed OFDMA for the
broadband wireless multiple access systems [11–13].
However, ICI may seriously damage the orthogonal
characteristic and increase the probability of ISI
simultaneously [14]. These inevitable internal factors will
reduce the quality of transmissions. In addition, it will
also encounter unpredictable external interferences called
‘noise’ [15, 16], which may be caused by temperature,
humidity, external electromagnetic waves and so an [17].
In the IEEE 802.16e scheduled transmission, each mobile
subscriber station (MSS) has its data stream that may be
arranged in a proﬁle or in some subchannels. These
proﬁles or subchannels are randomly put into slots for
transmission, thus much transmission frame space is left
empty and the proﬁle will waste much time in
transmission. These mechanisms cause serious carrier-to-
interference-and-noise ratio [18]. As a result, it can be
concluded that the IEEE 802.16e mechanism cannot
counteract the external interference nor solve the fading
problems [1]. Although the IEEE 802.16e standard is
proposed to solve this difﬁcult problem by using
automatic repeat-request or hybrid automatic repeat-
request retransmission mechanisms to keep a higher
successful transmission probability: these mechanisms will
waste a lot of system resource. Other methods such as
mobility-based call admission control scheme [19] and
adaptive power control [6] were also proposed to solve
these problems, although these methods do not consider
the arrangement of slots to enhance the transmission.
Hence, their improvements were limited and might cause
a lot of overheads [20, 21].
Since the error probability of a data burst depends on the
channel conditions to the subscribers, the probability of
successful transmission can be improved by distributing
slots of each data burst into different time slots and
subchannels. Therefore this paper proposes a scattered
mapping method called fault-tolerant transmission
mechanism (FTM) by breaking up the burst blocks into
slots and then allocating them into different positions in a
frame via a turntable algorithm (TA). By using FTM, the
slots of all bursts in the downlink will be rearranged to
support a more stable and secure transmission.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows:
Section 2 is an overview of IEEE 802.16e scheduled
transmission and an illustration of our system model.
Section 3 describes in detail how the FTM works to
improve the fault tolerance ability in the MAC layer.
Section 4 presents more proof and analysis. Section 5
describes the implementation of the proposed mechanism
with simulation results. Finally, the conclusion and the
future works are discussed in Section 6.
2 System model
The system model consists of multiple MSSs connecting to a
centralised BS on wireless fading channels, where multiple
connections (data ﬂows) can be supported by each MSS.
All connections communicate with the BS by using time
division multiplexing/time division multiple access. A
buffer is implemented at the BS for each connection and
operates in a ﬁrst-input–ﬁrst-output manner. The adaptive
modulation and coding (AMC) controller follows the
buffer at the BS (transmitter), and the AMC selector is
implemented at the MSS (receiver). Each connection
employs AMC scheme at the PHY layer.
Based on OFDMA IEEE 802.16e speciﬁcations [1], the
operating spectrum can be divided into Nc subchannels with
each subchannel occupying Ns time slots for multiple access
usage as shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the modulation
scheme quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), Mn-ary
rectangular/square quadrature amplitude modulators
(QAMs), the forward error correction codes and Reed–
Solomon concatenated with convolutional codes (CC)
schemes are taken into consideration.
Since the wireless channel quality is mainly subject to the
instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) g, which is the
statistical description based on the general Nakagami-m
model [22, 23], the received SNR g in each frame can thus
be a random variable with a gamma probability density
function, that is
pg(g) ¼
mmgm1
gmG(m)
exp mg
g
 
(1)
where m is the Nakagami fading parameter (m  1=2),
g ¼ E{g} is the average received SNR, and
G(m) ¼ Ð10 tm1etdt is the gamma function [24],
respectively. This channel model is suitable for ﬂat-fading
channels as well as frequency-selective fading channels in
the OFDMA system. This model includes the Rayleigh
channel when m ¼ 1. Let Nm denote the total number of
available transmission modes. According to [22], the
transmission power is assumed to be constant and the

where mod is the arithmetic modular operation. PU and PL are

3 Fault-tolerant transmission
mechanism
3.1 Turntable algorithm
As mentioned-above, there are many burst blocks in the one
frame space, each of which occupies several time slots. The
Ps(Bi) can be computed using the slots occupied by the
burst. If each slot has its own Ps(Bi) in this model, based
on the previous deﬁnitions and assumptions, the
probability-based scheme can modify the situation of
interference on the radio channel. FTM is based on the
OFDMA-PHY speciﬁcation to break up the slots and
distribute them into the whole frame space. This
mechanism will rearrange the slots over all burst blocks.
After permuting slots, we need to determine which slot is
the optimal or the suboptimal solution to perform the
optimal solution of the Ps(Bi) in each burst. This problem
is called a scattered mapping problem and is also an NP-
complete mathematical permutation problem [26–28]. The
main function of FTM is to increase the Ps(Bi) of each
burst. The higher Ps(Bi), the better. This is one of the
challenges for FTM.
FTM is operated by adjusting the time slot allocation of Bi
with one another. The reason is that each subchannel has its
corresponding successful transmission probability Pi(g). The
probability of transmission failure caused by unpredictable
external interference can be dispersed to different Bi if the
subchannel is under interference. Fig. 3 shows an example
of the rearranged time slots of burst blocks in the downlink
frame period. This mechanism can be applied to the
permutations in certain formula. Assume there are
N ¼ NcNs time slots in the downlink subframe [29]. The
permutation group G can be formulated as
G ¼ 1 2 . . . N  1 N
13 20 5 . . . . . .
 
(10)
where the ﬁrst row indicates the order of the original
permutation of the time slots and the second row indicates
the new arranged permutation of original time slots. This
rearrangement is a one-to-one correspondence mapping.
The time T (G) with the product of the permutation can be
modelled as
T (G) ¼ 1jGj
X
g[G
Yn
k¼1
a jk(g)k (11)
where jGj and g [ G are the absolute time of the
permutation and the time of permutation, respectively; k
and jk( g) are the length of the permutation cycle and the
number of cycles with the permutation cycle length k in g
[30].
The detail operations of probability-based FTM are
described in the following four steps.
S1. FTM calculates Ps(Bi) for all i ¼ 0, 1, . . . , NB  1,
where NB is the number of bursts in this time period by
using (8).
S2. After Ps(Bi) calculation, FTM determines an optimal slot
allocation to all Bi by using slot rearrangement scheme. Let
Ps(t) ¼
PNB1
i¼0 Ps(Bi)=NB be the average successful
transmission probability of all Bi and P
0
s(t) ¼
PNB1
i¼0
P 0s(Bi)=NB be the new Ps(t) after rearranging slots, where
P 0s(Bi) is the new probability of each Bi . The problem of
the determination of optimal slot allocation from G among
Bi so that P
0
s(t) is greater than Ps(t), or P
0
s(t)  Ps(t), is
an NP-complete problem [30]. To obtain a better P 0s(Bi),

3.3 Example of slots selection
To demonstrate how TA selects burst slots to enhance Ps(Bi),
we illustrate an example of a downlink OFDMA channel
consisting of six subchannels, each of which occupies four
continuous slots as shown in Fig. 6. There are, in this
example, six burst blocks arranged in a rectangle and
labelled as A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. The channel
successful transmission probability of each subchannel is
assumed to be various and their corresponding probabilities
Pi(g)
k, where k ¼ 4 (four slots in each subchannel), are 0.5,
0.9, 0.8, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.6. The slots are labelled from left to
right in each subchannel according to Pi(g)
4 in descending
order. Before rearranging the slots of each burst, FTM
computes, according to (8), the Ps(Bi) of each block Bi to
decide the precedence of bursts. The calculated Ps(Bi) is
given in Table 1. Based on the priority of each Ps(Bi), the
sequence order of Bi will be B, C, E, F, A and D. In this
example, the initial slot is a1 ¼ 1 and VR ¼ 2. These six
bursts will be orderly operated by TA. The sequence of slot
selection of burst B (shown with solid line arrow) is shown
in Fig. 6. After the rearrangement of all slots, we can see
that the P 0s(Bi) given in Table 1 obtains a higher P
0
s(t) than
that of original slot allocation to bursts, that is P 0s(t) > Ps(t).

subchannels and each of them has 24 data symbols. Each slot
is composed of two OFDMA symbols. Therefore the
capacity of downlink C ¼ 30 24=2 ¼ 360 slots.
The channel encoding scheme is the convolutional coding
(CC). Different modulation schemes with coding rate, for
example, QPSK 1/2, QPSK 3/4, 16-QAM 1/2, 16-
QAM 3/4, 64-QAM 2/3 and 64-QAM 3/4 are
considered. The usage of preamble, downlink/uplink
channel descriptor (DCD/UCD), DL-MAP and UL-
MAP will occupy ﬁrst three OFDMA symbols, then only
270 slots are available for data transmission. Each
simulation run lasts 30 s (6000 frames) and each simulation
result is obtained from averaging the results from 30
independent simulation runs. The simulation model-
speciﬁc parameters are listed in Table 2.
Although the channel model and fading environment will
lead to a different Pi(g), the value of Pi(g) always ranges
between 0 and 1. Therefore instead of investigating the
channel model and fading environment, we focus on how
NB and jBij (in slots) affect Ps(Bi). This investigation will
help us to realise how FTM affects Ps(Bi) by comparing to
legacy IEEE 802.16 transmission mechanism in the MAC
layer but not in the Phy layer.
5.2 Simulation results
First, we investigate Ps(Bi) with the condition NB [ [1, 100]
to evaluate the performance merits between the OFDMA
IEEE 802.16e transmission mechanism (denoted as
802.16e) and FTM. Fig. 7 shows the experiment results
that FTM outperform 802.16e in the Ps(Bi). The
maximum gap of Ps(Bi) between FTM and 802.16e is
approximately 0.8 (0.882 0.08) when NB ¼ 1 and a
smaller gap is 0.31 (0.532 0.22) when NB ¼ 100. As
shown in Fig. 7a, the reason why the Ps(Bi) of IEEE
802.16 increases but the Ps(Bi) of FTM decreases when NB
increases before NB ¼ 20, and the Ps(Bi) of IEEE 802.16
still increases slightly and reaches about 0.2 when
NB ¼ 100 is as follows. First, when NB is small, it means
that the size of each burst is large, for example the burst
size is 648 bytes (270 slots/5	12 bytes in 16-QAM 1/2
coding rate, see Table 3) when NB ¼ 5. On the contrary,
when NB is large, for example, NB ¼ 100, the burst size is
small (270 slots/100	12 bytes = 32.4 bytes). We note that
these values are based on the higher modulation rate. The
carried data of each burst will be smaller if the modulation
rate is lower.
Based on the knowledge, when NB is small (burst size is
large), FTM (the TA algorithm) has more possibility to
adjust and rearrange time slots for getting better Ps(Bi).
Obviously, when the NB increases (the burst size decreases),
the space (the possibility) of exchanging time slots by TA
among different bursts is getting smaller. Therefore the
Ps(Bi) of FTM will dramatically decrease to about 0.5
(50%) when NB reaches 20 (270 slots/20
	12 bytes = 162
bytes). However, by using FTM, the Ps(Bi) will remain in
0.5 and stay stably when NB increases. Although, the
Ps(Bi) of IEEE 802.16e will increase slightly when NB
increases. And it will reach only 0.2 (20%) when NB
reaches 100 (32.4 byes long per each burst). We note that
the value of NB ¼ 100 (concurrently 100 connections are
transmitted in the WiMAX system) is not a common value
in practice. In practice, the NB ¼ 20–30 is a more real
value in the current WiMAX transmission system.
Therefore comparing the results of Figs. 7a and b, based
on the result that the Ps(Bi) of the FTM still outperforms
those of 802.16e and the gap between 802.16e and FTM
always keeps in 30%, we can conclude that FTM is more
suitable for transmission in the OFDMA-based
communication system. The results can also prove that the
system performance is inﬂuenced by the number of bursts.
Hence, the number of bursts must be kept within a
reasonably small range.
The following simulations will investigate the effect of jBij
on the WiMAX transmission system. Fig. 8 shows the
relation between Ps(Bi) and jBij with a given number of
slots jBij [ [0, 200]. When jBij > 20, both the Ps(Bi) of
802.16e and FTM will become stable until jBij ¼ 200. As
shown in the ﬁgure, the minimum Ps(Bi) of FTM will
reach 0.47 when jBij reaches 20. In addition, FTM still
outperforms IEEE 802.16e by more than 30% when
jBij  200, owing to the effect of the appropriate slots
management in the BS. The outcome of this simulation
proved that jBij should not be too large. A smaller jBij will
take less transmission time, and hence the BS can serve
more users and increase the system performance; for
efﬁciency, the burst size should be kept to no more than 20
slots and jBij should not exceed 5% of the total frame space.
The following simulations are taken into consideration of
the system throughput. The throughput indicates the valid
data payload of the corresponding modulation. If the

The maximum throughput of simulation results is listed in
Table 4. From these results, we verify that a higher
modulation will lead to a higher valid data payload and
thus the transmission efﬁciency will be achieved.
Nevertheless, a higher modulation will need a higher SNR
to transmit and receive. The higher modulation will bring
about higher throughput and will need better channel
quality, and vice versa.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a FTM, which periodically adjusts
mapping patterns for BS to control the burst size and
allocate transmission slots. The simulation results illustrate
that FTM can yield approximately 30% throughput and
signiﬁcantly raise the successful transmission probability,
which outperforms IEEE 802.16e transmission mechanism.
Accordingly, a conclusion can be reached that the burst size
should be restricted to no more than 20 slots even under the
assigned maximum burst size; a burst size should not exceed
5% of the total frame space; a higher modulation will
produce larger throughput and need better channel quality
and vice versa. In addition to our proposed solutions, FTM
is shown as a dynamic solution that can serve all frame-
based system and is ready to be disposed all over the existing
network infrastructure. Hence, with transmission control in
uplink, FTM can be investigated further in the future for
supporting real-time QoS among macrocells.

Abstract. This paper proposes a fast macrocell label switching mechanism (MLSM) in the 
MPLS-WiMAX networks. The mobil station (MS) communicates with each other within macrocell, 
e.g., MSA in the cellA communicates with MSB in the other cell, and can be switched via the media 
access control (MAC) layer without involving the network layer. The average access delay of request 
from MSs is studied and analyzed in this paper. Finally, simulation results show that the purposed 
MLSM operates effectively and efficiently in terms of network throughput, average delay, and 
resource utilization. 
Introduction 
In the last decant, more and more users are interested in high-speed, high-capacity, and high-mobility 
over wider coverage areas and broadband access, termed third generation (3G) and beyond network, 
to support the different large-scale of data services [8]. To satisfy these requirements, it is important 
to design an all-label-switching-based transport infrastructure, which connects two or more the 
broadband wireless access (BWA) networks with the Internet [13]. The multi-protocol label 
switching (MPLS) is deployed in the Internet backbone to support service differentiation and traffic 
engineering [10]. In recent years, there has been interest in extending the MPLS capability to wireless 
access networks for mobility management support [9]. The IEEE 802.16d/e (denoted as 802.16) [6] 
wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) standards, also termed WiMAX (worldwide 
interoperability for microwave access), provides a framework of BWA network based on various 
base stations (BSs). Such infrastructure can be three kinds of combinations: (a) the traditional 802.16 
macrocell network (Traditional-802.16). (b) the MPLS-wireless network (MPLS-802.16), and (c) the 
macrocell MPLS -802.16 network (MLSM-802.16).  
In the Traditional-802.16 network, two or more 802.16 networks are connected by the 
Internet-based backbone shown in Fig. 1 (a). The base stations (BSs) is used as a role of 
router/gateway [4] and processes packets from/to backbone to/from its (BSA) or other cell‟s (BSB) 
subscriber stations (SSs) or mobile stations (MSs). In this network all packets first look up in the 
network layer to compare IP and to find their destinations. Then, the packets can be relayed or 
forwarded. IP lookup, however, will cost a lot of overheads and greatly degrade the system 
performance when the transmitted data is heavy.  
One of the efficiency ways to reduce IP lookup is MPLS mechanism [10]. The MPLS-802.16 
network is the same as the Traditional-802.16 network, but the backbone is adopted MPLS-based 
backbone shown in the Fig. 1 (b). In this network, it uses the label switch path (LSP) technique [11] 
that provides high performance in packet delivery without routing table lookup. However, this 
network does not consider the BS is still using IP lookup transmission mechanism. Therefore, the 
performance of MPLS-802.16 network is limited in BS to do IP lookup twice, once in the BSA and the 
other in the BSB. These IP lookup also cost more overheads. The remaining challenge is to find a way 
let BSs avoiding IP lookup, then the MPLS-802.16 network may satisfy the desirous infrastructure.

 following data will be packet within an MPLS label to the packets header switched directly. The BSA 
will keep the MPLS label and this TCID as a reference for the destination MAC address. Similarly, 
the local traffic is transferred by the local label without the MPLS label. If the traffic is for the local 
and transfers at the first time, e.g., an SA transmits to MSC within the same cell, the jeb-bit shall be 
set as 110. The jeb-bit 111 is means that the TCID mapping record has been ready to switch directly 
in the local. 
 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The system is modeled as an MLSM-802.16 network. It is composed of two or more cells, each cell 
has an XBS, connecting by the MPLS-based backbone. This model is considered transfer delay in the 
BS. The MSs are connected to a centralized XBS over wireless fading channels, where multiple 
connections (data flows) are supported by XBS. Several assumptions are made as follows. 
 The MPLS-based backbone is ready to support the MLSM-802.16 network in layer 2 label 
switching transmission. 
 The call arrivals to/from an MS are a Poisson process with rate (the average number of MSs per 
frame. 
 There are m servers, and each of them has an independently and identically distributed exponential 
service time distribution with mean 1/ (the average number of frames an SS requires from the 
resource). 
 The length of each packet in the request of an MS is an exponential distribution with a mean length 
 . 
The measuring parameters are as follows. 
  The length of each packet in the request of an SS. 
  The mean number of packets arrival rate of the IP lookup process.  
  The mean service rate of the IP lookup process (the number of packets per frame). 
T   The expected steady-state system waiting time. 
1T  The IP lookup delay time in the XBSA in the sending BS, i.e., BSA. 
2T    The IP lookup delay time in the XBSB in the receiving BS, i.e., BSB. 
T    The processing delay in the MLSM.  
TM802.16 The IP lookup system processing delay of legacy MPLS-802.16. 
TMLSM The system processing delay time of MLSM.  
The uplink resource allocation process of the IEEE 802.16 system can be treated as a multiserver 
mMM //  model as shown in Fig. 2: Arrivals are Poisson with rate  (the average number of MSs 
per frame). There are m servers, and each of them has an independently and identically distributed 
exponential service-time distribution with mean 1/  (the average number of frames an MS requires 
from the resource). Let C denote the capacity of the resource of uplink (the number of slots per frame). 
Based on the call admission control (CAC) rules, each MS is allowed to have the resource of mean k 
slots per frame for transmission if it is given permission to enter the system. The model satisfies the 
condition mkC  . We let  /r  be the offered work load rate and  mmr //   be the 
offered work load rate to a server.

NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS 
To compare the performance of MLSM with the legacy MPLS-802.16 mechanism, we adopt the 
QualNet 3.9.5 developer command-line simulator for practical IP lookup processing simulations [12]. 
The simulation is used to validate the numerical results obtained from TM802.16 (2) and TMLSM (7). 
The simulation environment is built up by one BS with a variable number of MSs sharing one 10 
MHz bandwidth channel, which is operating in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access 
(OFDMA) PHY mode with a size of 1024 fast fourier transform (FFT) and the time division duplex 
(TDD) mode. Each OFDMA frame length is 5 ms long, the ratio of downlink to uplink is 2:1 , and the 
ratio of outgoing traffic to turnaround traffic F is 3:1. According to the standard, in the uplink, there 
are 35 subchannels in one channel and each of them has 24 data symbols. Each MAC-slot (in slot for 
short) is composed of three OFDMA symbols. Therefore, the capacity of the uplink C = 35 x 24/3 = 
280 slots. The modulation and coding scheme is 16-QAM with 1/2 coding rate and each slot will 
carry 33.5 bytes. 
The simulation results (the dotted lines) and the numerical results (the solid lines) are shown in Fig. 
3. It shows that the simulation results match the numerical results in each case. The gap between the 
curves of simulation and analysis when   is low. For the reason, it is caused by the frame processing 
delay (one frame duration 5 ms) in the MAC layer of QualNet. 
It can be observed that MLSM consistently outperforms the legacy MPLS-802.16 in access delay 
when   increases. Before saturation point, the increase is slow. Then delay starts to increase rapidly 
thereafter. This is because after reaching saturation status, the queue lengths in MSs, MLSM and the 
XBS all start to increase, given a fixed amount of available bandwidth at the XBS side. The M802.16 
increases because of the delay caused by IP lookup (assume each packet needs 1 ms for IP looking up 
[1]). The IP lookup process in legacy MPLS-802.16 will be prolonged when  = 0.038, 0.076, 0.18 
(  = 3, 6, 9), because each packet has to process the IP lookup twice, once in the BSA the other in the 
BSB.

Location Estimation with Time-based Iteration Scheme”。以上四位的報告，以在NTT 
DoCoMo工作的研究員報告最為清楚，他所提出的觀點為在利用混合式的最大可
能性位置預測方式，來進行細胞通訊系統位置的預測方法。此一理論將可提供手
機使用者在位置預測上的精準度。 
在第二天的議會議程之中，個人被安排在Session 12的第三位上台報告，如圖
三所示。此次所發表的論文題目為Bidirectional Power Saving Scheme for IEEE 
802.16e Systems。論文主要在探討如何提供行動裝置最大的使用效能，在以往的
研究中，對於能源省電的方法皆只探討單一方向的研究，我們是第一位在國際會
議中提出需考慮雙向省電可能性問題的研究學者，在大會的報告中獲得與會大部
份教授的認同，同時有向我詢問有關此一研究的問題，獲得良好的回饋。會議主
席Younglok Kim認為此一方法十分符合現階段通訊的特性，同時對於此一方法亦
提出多項建議，對個人來說實在受益良多。

一、參加會議經過 
此次國際會議ChinaCom 2010為第五屆在中國境內所舉辦的通訊大會，此一
會議自2006年起每年固定會在中國各大城市中舉行，今年2010年又回到北京。會
議內容及項目包括： 
1. Frontier Communications and Networking 
2. Optical Communications and Networking 
3. Wireless Communications and Networking 
4. Advances in Internet 
5. Information and Coding Theory 
6. Networking and Information Security 
7. Signal Processing for Communications 
8. Multimedia Communications 
等八大主題來進行，內容含括通訊網路中的各項最新最重要的研究議題，每年在
此會議中往往都會有重要的發展貢獻被發表，是一個重要的學術研究發表活動。
也因此，個在今年將自己在IEEE 802.16e中所研究的Power Saving研究，利用此
一活動發表出來，同時與北京大學及清華大學頂尖研究學者交換意見，並吸取其
它研究議題，來充實自己的研究。 
今年的大會議程安排實分充實，第一天由許多有名的兩岸學者進行Keynote 
Speaking的演說，大會所邀請到的名人包括，Canada Waterloo University的莊衞華
教授，目前擔任IEEE Fellow及IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology期刊與多
本著名國際期刊的主編，演講題目為“Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks”，內容主要介
紹多項VANETs的研究議題以及所面臨的挑戰與未來發展方向。由於內容為目前
國內多所國立大學研究群的主要研究議題，同時在教育部也有多項教育改進計畫
Chul Park教授，內容談論在第四代行動通訊中，為了增加使用者的頻寬以及提供
更多的使用者使用，引進了Relay的觀念，此一設備的設立於傳統基地站台的無
線電含蓋範圍之內，利用無線電短程轉傳之方式，使用較高調變以獲得較高之頻
寬做法，而Park的論點為如何有效的選擇一個Relay Station，使得所預期的結果
與真實選擇的結果，其產生的結果是相符合的。文章中Park使用Adaptive 
Threshold的做法來完成，同時針對不同的situation and status來修改threshold以利
MS選出好的RS，這個想法是有其理論依據的。
