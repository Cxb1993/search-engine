fundamental salting effect on the solubility properties of extractants and stripper agents
in water for the extractive recovery application of stripper agent. The reliable
liquid–liquid equilibrium data of multi-component mixture systems are very useful in
many extractive process designs, because those phase equilibrium properties of such
mixture systems cannot be predicted from pure component values. The focus of this
object is placed on the phase behavior of LLE for the ternary system of water +
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, the main component of stripper agent) + 1-hexanol
(extractant) and three quaternary systems of water + NMP + 1-hexanol + sodium
chloride (NaCl), + potassium chloride (KCl), or + potassium acetate (KAc) at
temperatures 283.15 K and 323.15 K under atmospheric pressure. These new LLE
data are correlated with the solution model of the Electrolyte-NRTL1-3. The
Electrolyte-NRTL model can be reduced to the original NRTL model4 for salt-free
systems. Good quantitative agreement was obtained with these models.
Experimental Section
Chemicals. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was obtained from Mallinckrodt. 1-Hexanol
was supplied by Fluka Chemicals (Germany). Deionized distilled water was prepared in
our laboratory. The purities of these liquid compounds were greater than 99 %. Sodium
chloride and potassium acetate were purchased from Riedel-deHaën. Potassium chloride
was obtained from J. T. Baker. The salt compounds were dried in an oven until the
weight remained as a constant before being used. All the liquid chemicals were checked
with chromatographic analysis and used without further purification.
Apparatus and Procedure. Liquid-liquid equilibrium data for the ternary and
quaternary systems were measured by an apparatus similar to that of Peschke and
Sandler,5 basically including a jacketed glass cell, a thermostatically controlled bath, a
magnetic agitator and a gas chromatography. In the jacketed equilibrium glass cell
tabulated in Table 1. The experimental mole fractions for each phase were obtained by
averaging the results from these five replications. Since no literature LLE data can be
available at comparable conditions for those ternary and quaternary systems above, the
LLE measurements of ternary system water + ethanol + 1-pentanol and a quaternary
system water + ethanol + 1-pentanol + KCl at 298.15 K were conducted to test the
validity of our experimental procedure. Figure 1 compares the experimental results with
the literature values6. It shows that our measurements agree with literature values
within the experimental uncertainties.
Experimental Results
The experimental apparatus was firstly employed to measure the LLE data of water
+ N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol at 283.15 K and 323.15 K under atmospheric
pressure. Table 2 reports the experimental results, the superscript I represents the
organic-rich phase and II the aqueous phase. Figure 2 is the phase diagram for the
ternary system of water + N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol. Because water /
1-hexanol is the only pair that is partially miscible, the ternary system behaves as a
Type 1 of LLE. Very small amounts of the organic compounds were found in the
aqueous phase, while water dissolved appreciably in the organic-rich phase, especially
near the plait point. The experimental results show that the solubilities of water in the
1-hexanol increase with an increase of temperature. Since the system of water +
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol behaves as a type 1 LLE, the effects of adding an
electrolyte (a salt) on the mutual solubilities of water + 1-hexanol can provide useful
indications for the liquid phase-splitting enhancement. The electrolytes used in this
research are NaCl, KCl, and KAc. The experimental results show that the immiscibility
gaps are substantially enlarged as NaCl, KCl, or KAc was introduced in the aqueous
where x is the molar fraction, the superscript I represents the organic-rich phase and II
the aqueous phase, and the subscripts NMP and w represent the components
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and water, respectively. Figures 5 and 6 show the distribution
ratio, K, and the selectivity, S, as a function of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone composition on
the aqueous phase for the investigated systems at 323.15 K, respectively. As seen from
Figures 5 and 6, the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone is effectively removed from aqueous phase
while the different salts are added, especially in the case of NaCl.
LLE Calculations
At liquid-liquid equilibrium, the mole fractions Iix and

Where Ii and IIi are the activity coefficients of component i in phases I and II,

solved simultaneously from the following equations:

where nc is the number of components, Ki is the distribution ratio for component i,is
mole fractions of component i in phase j on tie-line k, respectively. For the reason of
admissible LLE correlations for salt-containing systems, the non-randomness
parameters ij in the water + N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol system were fixed to
be 0.276, 0.275, and 0.313 for water / N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, water / 1-hexanol, and
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone / 1-hexanol pairs, respectively. Table 8 presents the correlated
results from the NRTL. Figure 2 also compares the calculated binodal locus and tie-lines
from the NRTL model with the experimental results. As seen from Figure 2, good
agreements between the calculated results from the NRTL model and experimental
values have been obtained for the water + N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol system.
For the three quaternary systems of water + N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 1-hexanol +
NaCl, KCl, or KAc, the isothermal LLE data were correlated with the Electrolyte-NRTL
model by adjusting three salt-related pairs of parameters simultaneously. The
