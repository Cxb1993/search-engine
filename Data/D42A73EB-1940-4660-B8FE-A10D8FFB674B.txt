Abstract 
Glucosamine (2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose) is an amino monosaccharide that is an essential 
component of mucopolysaccharide and chitin.  It can repair and rebuild the damaged cartilage 
and it also can cure the disease of osteoarthritis.  This study uses Aspergillus sp. BCRC31742 to 
product glucosamine by using fermentation.  Three parts were discussed in this study.  First is 
the fermentation medium in flask culture including kinds of various carbon sources, nitrogen 
sources and macronutrients were studied.  The experimental result shows that the optimum 
glucosamine concentration of 5.48 g/L; biomass of 21.6 g/L; content of 0.25 g/g biomass; yield of 
0.22 g/g carbon source and productivity of 32.6 mg/L．h by using Aspergillus sp. BCRC31742 
culture in medium, which carbon source is superior white fine granulated sugar and nitrogen 
source is peptone.  Second, the nitrogen sources were soy bean meal and peptone, the 
glucosamine concentration has a maximum value 5.41 g/L; biomass, 46.7 g/L; content, 0.12 g/g 
biomass; yield, 0.22g/g carbon source and productivity, 32.2 mg/L．h.  Finally, use the optimum 
medium to fermentation and change the aeration with air and oxygen to control the dissolved 
oxygen.  When dissolved oxygen is 10%, there are maximum glucosamine concentration 3.91 
g/L; biomass conc. 14.6 g/L; content 0.27 g/g biomass; yield 0.16 g/g carbon source; productivity 
23.3 mg/L．h. 
 
1、 Introduction 
People can follow one's inclinations to 
take various poses because of joint.  Thus 
cartilage is a crucial tissue of human body.  
People use the joint without a break of the 
cartilage surface everyday in life.  Once 
attaining a sort of degrees especially in the 
seasonal change, Arthritis deformans is 
coming.  In the early time, it doesn’t have 
any effective drugs for these Arthritis 
deformans.  Glucosamine is an amino 
monosaccharide which is produced in the 
body, and can be found in small amounts in 
foods, plays an important role in maintaining 
cartilage.  When taken as a dietary 
supplement, glucosamine may help relieve the 
pain, stiffness, and swelling of osteoarthritis.  
Glucosamine, commonly used the form 
 6
7H2O, (0.5g/L) and CaCl2(0.1g/L) to find out 
the best carbon source.  After finding out the 
best carbon source, the concentration of 
carbon source was studied to obtain the best 
concentration of carbon source.  Use the 
medium of the best carbon source as the basic 
medium.  Organic or inorganic nitrogen 
compounds were studied for the nitrogen 
source in medium to find out the best nitrogen 
source.  The best concentration of nitrogen 
source was also determined in the similar way.  
At last is the other macronutrient, the medium 
which has the best carbon and nitrogen source 
as the basic medium, and then adding various 
composition of macro nutrient (e.g. Na) to 
find out the great effect upon production of 
glucosamine by Aspergillus sp. BCRC 31742.  
The glucosamine concentration was analyzed 
with HPLC. 
3.1.2 Medium optimization by response 
surface methodology 
First, chosen a start point and design the 
factor level of superior white fine granulated 
sugar, peptone, ZnSO4．7H2O and MnSO4.  
In this section, full factorial or fractional 
factorial to do experiment were used due to 
specitic nature of experimental variables.  
Second, the results could get the first-order 
model, and then using the gradient search 
method to calculate the new step to proceed 
experiment by steepest descent.  Finally, 
when get the extreme value was obtained, 
used the Box-Behnken design was used to get 
the optimum predicted glucosamine 
concentration.  The final optimal conditions 
to produce glucosamine was also confirmed 
via experimental confirmation.  The 
glucosamine concentration was analyzed with 
HPLC. 
3.2 Cost-effective nitrogen source – soy 
bean 
The final study is soy bean, the medium 
which has peptone as nitrogen source, and 
then adding various concentration of soybean 
or let soy bean replace the peptone in the 
medium to find out the effect upon production 
of glucosamine Aspergillus sp.. The 
glucosamine concentration was analyzed with 
HPLC. 
3.3 Production and cost evaluation of 
glucosamine in fermenter 
Laboratory scale fermentation was 
performed in 2 L working volume using a 5-L 
fermenter.  The pH was automatically 
controlled around 7.0 using 3 N NaOH.  The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured by a 
polarographic oxygen electrode.  The inlet 
gas was filtered through a filter with pore size 
of 0.2 μm.  Growth medium was sterilized 
via moist-heat autoclave.  After cooling, the 
100 cm3 of fungal pre-culture was added as 
seeding culture into the fermenter.  The 
fermentation was carried out at 30°C and 200 
rpm.  The dissolved oxygen was controlled 
with air of 1L/min and if needed the air was 
enriched with varying concentrations of pure 
oxygen.  Foam was controlled by addition of 
antifoaming agent.  The operation duration 
for fermentation was 7 day.。 
 
4、 Results and Discussion 
4.1 Optimum strategy of producing 
glucosamine in shake flask cultures 
4.1.1 One-factor-at-one-time method 
Fig. 1 were plots of glucosamine conc., 
biomass, content, productivity, and yield on (a) 
carbohydrate compounds (b) oil compounds 
of A. sp. BCRC 31742 in medium.  When the 
 8
and yield on macro nutrient of Aspergillu sp. 
BCRC 31742 in medium and (a) 0.1g/L macro 
nutrient (b) 0.5g/L macro nutrient.  When the 
macro nutrient is Na2HPO4, Al(NO3)3, ZnSO4, 
MnSO4 or H3BO3, the glucosamine 
concentration has apparent variation.  
Adding 0.1g/L Na2HPO4, ZnSO4, MnSO4 or 
H3BO3, the glucosamine is higher than 3g/L.  
Adding 0.5g/L of those macro nutrients, the 
glucosamine is lower than 3g/L.  It showed 
there is possibility of higher glucosamine with 
lower than 0.1g/L or between 0.1g/L and 
0.5g/L of Na2HPO4, ZnSO4, MnSO4 or H3BO3.  
Regarding macro nutrient Al(NO3)3, it also 
has apparent variation, but possibility of 
higher glucosamine was added higher than 
0.5g/L or between 0.1g/L and 0.5g/L.  In this 
section, added 0.1g/L ZnSO4 in medium to 
culture has a maximum value glucosamine 
concentration 3.79 g/L; biomass, 13.5 g/L; 
content, 0.28 g/g biomass; yield, 0.15 g/g 
carbon source; productivity, 22.5 mg/L．h.    
According to the experimental results about 
production of glucosamine, it was found 
adding ZnSO4 to culture seemed to be the 
optimal production. 
Fig. 6 were plots of glucosamine 
concentration on macro nutrient of Aspergillu 
sp. BCRC 31742 in medium.  When the 
macronutrient is Na2HPO4 and H3BO3, the 
highest glucosamine concentrations are lower 
than 3.34g/L.  It was nor appropriate to 
discuss the effect of macro nutrient.  And the 
macro nutrient is Al(NO3)3 in 0.3g/L, it has the 
highest glucosamine concentration of 3.20 g/L.  
However, its glucosamine concentration is 
still lower than 3.34g/L.  If adding the other 
kind of concentration of Al(NO3)3, it would 
not has higher glucosamine concentration.  
The macro nutrient in 0.3g/L of Al(NO3)3 is in 
critical point.  When the macro nutrient is 
ZnSO4 and MnSO4, glucosamine 
concentration could arrive 3.44g/L and 
3.70g/L.  The lower concentration of 0.1g/L 
of ZnSO4 and MnSO4 might have higher 
glucosamine concentration. 
4.1.2 Medium optimization by response 
surface methodology 
Table 1 were showed that in foregoing 
results, it found that the effective compound is 
superior white fine granulated sugar, peptone, 
ZnSO4, MnSO4.  Regardings Box’s RSM, 
JMP software could be ised for assigned sets 
in experimental design.  Two-level factorial 
design of 4 factors (e.g. two-level design) 
could be studied for determination of major 
effects, two-factor or multiple factor 
interactions.   
Table 2 was the regression analysis of the 
glucosamine concentration obtained from 
two-level design.  The macronutrients like 
ZnSO4 and MnSO4 have low changed so the 
system of RSM was deleted them.  In this 
section, superior white fine granulated sugar 
and peptone are influenced factors.  
According to foregoing results of two level 
design and path of steepest ascent, the new 
original point was found.  The new original 
point and new step was used to design 
experiment. 
Fig. 7 was plots of glucosamine 
concentration, biomass, content, productivity, 
and yield on path steepest ascent of Aspergillu 
sp. BCRC 31742 in medium.  It found that 
glucosamine concentration was increased 
from step-1 to step4.  Step4 is highest of 
glucosamine concentration so this step should 
be a new origin point to find the actual critical 
point. 
Table 3 was the regression analysis of the 
glucosamine concentration obtained from 
 10
fermentation process, power and operating.  
The carbon source was used the superior 
white fine granulated sugar to replace glucose.  
Superior white fine granulated sugar is 
cheaper than glucose.  Its cost is reduced 
from 1.14 USD/L to 0.02 USD/L.  So the 
medium cost was reduced from 1.19 USD/ 
g-product to 0.42 USD/ g-product. 
 
5、 Conclusion 
This study successfully fermented by 
Aspergillus sp. BCRC31742 to produce 
glucosamine in flask cultures.  The 
maximum concentration was up to 5.48 g/L 
from Aspergillus sp. BCRC31742 in defined 
medium which use superior white fine 
granulated sugar, peptone, KH2PO4, MgSO4 
and CaCl2 at 30°C, 200rpm, pH 7, and 7days.  
The cost of carbon source is reduced from 
1.14 USD/Kg repoeted by Hsieh (2007) to 
0.02 USD/Kg.  Raw material cost is reduced 
from 1.19 USD/Kg repoeted by Hsieh (2007) 
to 0.42 USD/Kg. 
Submerged fermentation: This study 
successfully used the culture condition in flask 
to produce glucosamine in 5-liter fermenter.    
The maximum concentration was up to 3.91 
g/L using Aspergillus sp. BCRC31742 in WF 
medium and 10% of control of dissolved 
oxygen at 30°C, 200rpm, pH 7, and 7days by 
fermenter.  The strategy of fermentation in 
pH-state and fed bathc were not successful to 
improve the production of glucosamine, which 
is lower than 3g/L.

展的結合，所討論的面比較廣，雖然仍是談概念性的想法，但這對往後化
工的教育以及課程的演變將有很大關係，台灣在這方面要多用心才能與產
業的潮流相配合。整體而言，學術交流對本人有很大的幫助。對未來工作
有很多的啟發性，最後感謝本校及國科會經費的補助。
