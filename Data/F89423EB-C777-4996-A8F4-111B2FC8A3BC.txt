Intelligent Force/Position Hybrid Control of Robots with 
Oscillatory Base Interacting with Unknown Environments 
 
ABSTRACT 
The interest toward complex robot systems is expanding for new application areas. An 
example of such a system is a dexterous manipulator mounted on an oscillatory base. In 
literature, such a system is known under the name macro/micro system. By attaching a small 
manipulator, “micro” to a mobile vehicle or other platform, “macro” carries the micro to the 
point of interest, and the micro performs the tasks. However, in order to accomplish the desired 
performance, both micro and macro should be able to overcome coupling force due to each 
other’s motion. The proposed research focuses on the issue of hybrid force/position control of 
the robots with oscillatory base interacting with geometrically unknown environments. The 
purpose of controlling a system is to control the contact force between the environment and 
object in the constrained directions. Therefore, the main goal of this project is concentrated to 
analysis the dynamic characteristics for such a system. Moreover, it is required to design a 
controller whose main control action is the neuro-fuzzy control, and plus a supervisory 
controller which operates only when some undesirable phenomena occur. The fuzzy system are 
incorporated with linguistic fuzzy information from human knowledge and equipped with a 
training algorithm. Furthermore, if the pure fuzzy controller works well, the supervisory 
controller is idle; if the fuzzy control tends to be unstable, the supervisory controller begins 
operation to guarantee stability. The results of this study can be feasible to various mechanical 
systems, such as mobile robot, gantry cranes, underwater robot, and other dynamic systems 
mounted on oscillatory bases during on constraint motion tasks.

trajectories while ensuring exact identification of constraint Jacobian matrix without 
persistency of excitation condition. The paper introduces a methodology of active tracking of 
unknown surface using force sensing and control technique for robot is shown in [18]. The 
proposed hierarchical system of force sensing and control for robot is built from the 
perspective of large-scale system.  
Force control has been known to be one of the complicated control algorithms for robot to 
manipulate with other objects. Specially, when the robot interacts with the environment, the 
desired force should be maintained while following the desired trajectories. The improvement 
of the controller robustness by applying the neural network (NN) technique to compensate for 
uncertainties in the robot model is presented in [19-20]. The proposed neural force control 
scheme is capable of making the robot track a specified desired force as well as of 
compensating for uncertainties in environment location and stiffness, and in robot dynamics. 
Similarly, reference [21], a new simple stable force tracking impedance control scheme that has 
the capability to track a specified desired force and to compensate for uncertainties in 
environmental location and stiffness as well as in robot dynamic model is proposed. 
Furthermore, the paper [22] addresses the problem of online estimation of the mechanical 
impedance during the contact of a robotic system with an unknown environment. However, 
previous studies are limited to rigid link robots, no oscillatory bases effect has been taken into 
consideration for the subsystem interaction.  
Therefore, the proposed research focuses on the issue of hybrid force/position control of 
the robots with oscillatory base interacting with geometrically unknown environments. The 
purpose of controlling a system is to control the contact force between the environment and 
object in the constrained directions. Therefore, the main goal of this project is concentrated to 
analysis the dynamic characteristics for such a system. Moreover, it is required to design a 
controller whose main control action is to track the desired trajectory, and plus a supervisory 
controller which operates only when some undesirable phenomena occur.

where we have assumed that the link mass 1m , 2m  are concentrated at the ends of the link. 
Furthermore, 1a  and 2a  are the link length, respectively. Consequently, the manipulator 
dynamics is strongly affected by nonlinear forces due to the oscillation of the base as well as its 
own nonlinearity; these include gravity, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces, which are generally 
intrinsic to a mechanical system [3-5]. 
For the practical application point of view, often one mode (which is coupled with 
translation and rotation) is dominant in structural oscillation. Controlling translation implies 
controlling rotation too. Therefore, the paper focuses on translate oscillation only as an initial 
study. The assumption is the same as the literature shown in [1].  
In addition, the constraint function will depend on the manipulator generalized joint 
coordinates q and the generalized deflection variables bx , and may be expressed as 
0),()( == bxqx φφ                                                       (6) 
We consider (.,.)φ  to be a vector valued function, i.e., mmpn ℜ→ℜ ×+ )(:φ , where m is the 
number of constraints and )( pnm +≤ . The simplest case is one in which the manipulator 
end-effector is in contact with a rigid surface, and m=1 [23].

III. CONTROLLER DESIGN 
When the joint sensors and actuators of the manipulator are located at the same place, the 
system looks collocated. But it is not collocated, due to the flexibility base. Normally, it is very 
difficult to attach another collocated sensor and actuator to measure and stabilize the base 
flexibility. In general, without the presence of additional sensors, strain gauges, accelerometers,

3.1 Controller Implementation 
3.1.1 Fuzzy Tracking Controller (FTC) 
Decomposition and coordination are the conventional method and important idea in the 
study on large-scale system. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical fuzzy control scheme to 
fulfill the control requirement, which includes pure fuzzy position/force tracking controller 
(FTC), and fuzzy supervisory controller (FSC). Due to the complexity of this two link planar 
robot mounted on an oscillatory base, it decomposes the control task into two subtasks and 
distributes them over two different levels.  
For the position controller, the lower level is a FTC, which controls the robot link to track 
the desired trajectory. The lower level controllers only take into account each subsystem 
ignoring the interactions among them. To implement the proposed technique, the lower level is 
decomposed into two subsystems: the first subsystem takes tracking error 1e  ( θθ −= de ) and 
its derivatives 1e&  as local variables for link 1 subsystem, while the second subsystem takes 
2e  and 2e&  as local variables for link 2 subsystem, respectively. Therefore, the fuzzy tracking 
controller FTC1 takes 1e  and 1e&  as inputs to generate the local control action uc1, while fuzzy 
tracking controller FTC2 takes 2e  and 2e&  to take another control action uc2. Thus, at the local 
level, each subsystem is designed separately. The fuzzy logic rule base for each subsystem is

Let us now derive the parameter learning for such system. The training algorithm is similar 
to the reference [14, 18, 19]. Assume that dy  is the desired output for input vector

3.1.2 Fuzzy Supervisory Controller (FSC) 
In order to guarantee that the robot manipulators does not hitting the constraint sets when it 
movements, the research add a supervisory controller that takes control action in extreme 
situations. The supervisory controller consists of some coordination control rules that take 
actions in the subsystem interactions. Specifically while the idea that dividing the control task 
into multiple levels of coordination or supervision and execution has been widely promoted, the 
issue of how one may design the higher levels within the hierarchy has remained the major 
stumbling block in connection with the design of such system. 
However, fuzzy logic may be best used to implement upper level or supervisory functions in 
a hierarchically structured intelligent control system. As depicted in Fig. 6, fuzzy logic control 
can appear at the upper levels, and acts as the supervisory controller. The supervisory controller 
in this paper is tuning the decomposed fuzzy controllers in a way that some performance 
measured is improved without a dramatic change. 
In order to solve the oscillatory base problem, it is crucial to cope with the disturbance due 
to the base oscillation, which is exerted at the input port of the plant. For this task, the research 
appends the FTC uc with a FSC us, which is nonzero only when the state q hits the boundary of 
the constraint set }:{ qMqq ≤ . Therefore, the main control action is still the FTC uc. Our task 
now is to design the FSC us to refine the control action and to let the state q always have 
qMtq ≤)(  for all t>0. 
Some of the papers [20] use the step switch in the supervisory controller as an indicator 
function. However, in such case, the supervisory controller begins operation suddenly as q hits 
the boundary qMtq =)(  and is idle as soon as the q is back to the interior of the constraint set 
qMtq ≤)( , therefore the system may oscillate across the boundary line qMtq =)( . In order to 
overcome this drawback, the supervisory controller has proposed as a fuzzy control type in this 
paper. Using this fuzzy control concept, the fuzzy supervisory controller us operates 
continuously from zero to full strength as q changes from 0 to Mq. 
At the upper (supervisory) level, the information from each subsystem is taken as an input 
to the supervisory controller. To coordinate each local subsystems, the upper level FLC takes 
21 ee −  and 21 ee && −  as inputs to generate the correction factors 1w  and 2w . Hence, the upper 
level controller monitors these differences and causes the supervisory decision to be fed to the

IV. EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION 
An experimental device was designed and constructed to verify both model development 
and controller design. The description of the device is the same as the reference [17]. Figure 7 
shows the experiment apparatus. If the link moves on a horizontal plane, it is called horizontal 
motion (Fig. 9a). Moreover, the link moves on a vertical plane, it is called vertical motion (Fig. 
9a). The test results are obtained by the aforementioned procedures using MATLAB and 
Simulink. Two servomotors are attached to each joint with optical encoders for measuring the 
position of the motor shaft. Optical encoders are used as the position feedback device for 
sensing the angular displacement of the motor shaft. Moreover, the base compliance was 
described four linear springs (stiffness 200 N/m for each spring). Base vibration is measured 
using a PCB PIEZOTRONICS Model 208C1 force sensor, which is attached on the oscillatory 
face. Moreover, the contact force sensor is measured by the KEYENCE GT-H10. The 
experimental results are still under investigation and will be shown in the forthcoming paper.
