can provide an UWB operating bandwidth of 3.1−10.6 GHz. 
To obtain the band-notched characteristic, an U-like slot is embedded in the rectangular stub. 
The U-like slot has a uniform width 1.5 mm, two vertical lengths of L1 and L2, and a horizontal 
length L3. The three parameters of the length, L1, L2, and L3, are used to optimize the 
band-notched performance. When the total length of the U-like slot is adjusted to be about a 
half-wavelength at the center frequency of the desired notched frequency band, a narrow 
frequency band could be notched out while maintaining good matching across the rest of the 
UWB frequency band. 
 
四、結果與討論 
The proposed antenna was simulated and optimized using the Ansoft High-Frequency 
Structure Simulator (HFSS) simulation software. The constructed prototype was fabricated and 
measured using the Agilent N5230A PNA-L network analyzer. Figure 2 shows the measured and 
simulated VSWR for the proposed antenna with the U-like slot. Result for the reference antenna 
without the U-like slot is also shown for comparison. Good agreement between the simulated and 
measured results is first seen. It is also seen that for reference antenna, an UWB bandwidth 
(defined by VSWR ≤ 2) of 2.8−12 GHz is obtained. For the proposed antenna with the U-like slot 
of L1 = 7.5 mm, L2 = 9 mm, and L3 = 8 mm, a notched frequency band centered at 5.34 GHz is 
observed. To further demonstrate the effect of the U-like slot on the notched frequency band, 
Figure 3 shows the measured results for the proposed antenna with various values of L3. As seen 
in the figure, the center frequency of the notched frequency band is varied from 5.78 to 5.0 GHz 
by adjusting L3 from 6 to 10 mm. 
The far-field radiation characteristics of the proposed antenna were also studied. Figure 4 
plots the measured radiation patterns in the x-z and y-z planes at 3 and 7.9 GHz for the proposed 
antenna studied in Figure 2. It is observed that the radiation patterns at lower frequency (3 GHz) 
are similar to those of the conventional slot antenna, while at higher frequency (7.9 GHz), the 
copolarized components of the radiation pattern are distorted. Figure 5 shows the measured 
antenna gain for the proposed and reference antennas studied in Figure 2. A sharp antenna gain 
decrease in the notched frequency band is seen. For other frequencies outside the notched 
frequency band, a small variation in the antenna gain is seen for both proposed and reference 
antennas. 
 
五、結論 
An UWB square slot antenna embedded with an U-like slot for achieving the band-notched 
characteristic has been proposed and successfully implemented. The desired notched frequency 
band can be easily controlled by adjusting the length of the U-like slot. In addition, for 
frequencies outside the notched frequency band, small effects due to the U-like slot embedded in 
the proposed antenna were observed.
