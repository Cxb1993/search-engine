Abstract
With the rapid development of 3D virtual environment and high-speed internet, it has
become another selection for many consumers to shop in web stores. However, there are some
issues need to investigate on the elderly spatial abilities that influence their intention to browse on
the web stores. Those abilities include primarily of orientation and merchandise recognition. If
these abilities can be studied clearly and considered in design of 3D virtual store, the practicality
of 3D virtual store for elderly can be raised effectively. The main contents of this research include:
(1) to evaluate the effect of the elderly spatial knowledge acquired by navigation map and route,
(2) to evaluate the effect of improvement on disorientation when landmarks involved in cognitive
map. Finally, an optimal navigation aiding mode for improve space cognition was constructed.
Keywords: 3D virtual stores, elderly, navigation, disorientation
2了 3 個不同知識層面的呈現：地標(Landmark)、路徑(Route)及縱覽知識(Survey
knowledge)。Thorndyke 等人(1982)認為路徑的知識是在環境中，一連串點與
點連接程序的描述，並對於所在點的位置進行某些後續行動，如：轉彎或直
行，以達到目的地。Hintzman 等人(1981)認為縱覽知識為一地理區塊圖像的
呈現，包含區塊中所有單元的配置及彼此之間的關係。一般而言，路徑知識
的組織方式是線性或順序性的，縱覽知識則較具有整體的空間結構概念，並
試圖整理主要空間元素的關係，其空間資訊組織的方式是空間性的，當瀏覽
者利用縱覽知識來理解環境中物件與物件彼此間的相對方位關係時，它是屬
於俯瞰式的空間呈現方式，而非地標或路徑知識所呈現的是瀏覽者與環境的
相對關係。以上這三種層次的空間知識均各自對空間位置的認知產生某種程
度的幫助，在一般狀況下，此三種知識的形成順序為一階層關係(Witmer,
Bailey & Knerr, 1996)，地標知識是形成路徑知識或縱覽知識的基礎，瀏覽者
必須先擁有地標知識後，才能有助於發展更高階的空間知識。Golledge (1999)
在其著作中曾提到地標的功用有兩種，其一為扮演錨點的角色，用做環境中
不同區域的連接點，在空間認知知識中，地標最主要的功用是組織並連結空
間；第二種功用則是被當作尋路的輔助工具，尋路者可以將地標當作方向辨
識、路徑決策的參考點。Goldin 和 Thorndyke(1982)及後來的 Wickens 和
Hollands(1999)提出對於地標知識的看法，他們認為這一類知識是環境中顯著
目標的視覺呈現，這個目標可能是一突出的人造物或景物中獨特的視覺物
件。通常在一陌生環境，地標是最先獲取的一個空間知識；對於地標的認識
將成為路徑知識的一部份，經由地標的點知識逐漸組成路徑知識；這些地標
知識也形成縱覽知識中的物件與元素 (Chen, 1999; Wickens & Hollands,
1999)。此外，Jansen-Osmann(2002)在對於人們在虛擬環境中如何形成路徑知
識，以及路標在虛擬環境中所扮演角色的研究中發現，路標輔助可以幫助使
用者較快完成尋路任務，同時轉錯彎的次數也較沒有路標輔助來的少，此意
味路標的輔助確實可以幫助尋路者加強尋路效率，同時在尋路過程中，其路
徑的學習速度也比沒有路標輔助者快。由這些研究報告可看出，地標對於路
徑知識與縱覽知識形成的重要性，所以有部分研究朝向探討地標對於定位導
覽及空間方向感的影響程度，所獲致的結論發現，若缺乏適當的地標將造成
定位導覽困難及空間方向感能力的下降(Passini, 1996; Waller et al., 1998;
Vinson, 1999)。Benelli 等人(1975)指出，一個成年人在學習認識新環境時，首
先需要兩類知識，即地標知識與路徑知識，因為尋路者必須先對該地區路標
熟悉後，才能了解該地區的路徑，而最後才形成完整的縱覽知識，綜而觀之，
地標知識幫助瀏覽者判斷方位，並做為連結兩地路徑的參考指標；路徑知識
對於兩個地點彼此之間的導覽活動有較大的幫助；縱覽知識則是呈現鳥瞰式
的環境全覽。
(2) 空間知識的擷取
另外一個影響空間方向感能力的議題就是空間知識的擷取；有多項針對人們
4回的錯誤與學習過程，建構地標知識中錨點的座標，並連接成路徑知識，若路徑
知識構成完整的網絡，就會形成縱覽知識。不過在搜尋與瀏覽過程中，因網路商
店並非是大區域的街廓，可能地標知識或路徑知識即可滿足空間的認知。而在決
策的過程中，高齡瀏覽者需要注意瀏覽過程中的一景一物，並透過滑鼠等控制器
的操作物質性介面 (physical representation)，進而連動數位化界面 (digital
representation)，讓高齡瀏覽者感知到數位資訊所帶來空間狀態的改變，進而產生
個人與虛擬商店的互動關係。依此模式，可以清楚闡釋高齡者在空間認知記憶的
形成過程，包括空間資訊擷取、記憶與提取的處理程序。

5.2 結論
第一年研究主題，係針對高齡使用者在進行 3D 虛擬商店瀏覽過程中，導覽策略與物品
間展示分類，對於空間認知與尋物時間的評估分析，經由實驗驗證，獲致以下結論：
(1)商品展示間的分類將有助於空間知識的建立
在虛擬商店情境中，若將商品依性質分類於不同的展示間，將易形成認知空間中的大街
廓，而每一展示間的櫥櫃擺設則類似街道，櫥櫃內的物品則類似建築物，因此可形成虛
擬商店的空間認知地圖。本階段研究僅將商品做大分類(分為四區)，並將之置放於櫥櫃
中的不同隔層，經由實驗可知，對於路徑知識的形成有極大的幫助，故在尋物時間及路
徑知識的評分，均較未經商品分類之展示空間來的佳。
(2)地標在路徑知識的建立，扮演極重要的腳色，
在商品展示方式無規則分類情境下，空間認知地圖的形成是相對較為困難，但是地標將
有助於片段知識的形成，對於尋物的相對空間位置，仍可提供必要的線索，相較於無地
標的展示空間，尋物時間明顯縮短許多。
(3)不同形式的地標所產生的路徑知識有顯著的差異
本研究在地標的形式設計上，分為 3D、2D 及文數字方式，結果顯示在 3D 虛擬商店情
境中，3D 地標所呈現空間的認知效果最佳，2D 及文數字的顯示則無太大的差異，這結
果不論是在商品展示空間有或無規則分類的情境中，都是相同。此結果說明在 3D 虛擬
商店中，使用者對於 3D 物件的呈現，較容易吸引注意力；若適當結合 2D 及 3D 的地標
顯示，則應會有 Redundancy 的效果。
(4)空間知識越佳，尋物時間表現越佳
經統計結果分析顯示，空間知識的多寡與完成尋物所需花費的時間，是呈現負相關，亦
即當空間知識評分越高，其尋物時間就越短。若使用者在進入 3D 虛擬商店後，能夠很
快速的建立空間知識，必能有效縮短其尋物時間，減低前述發生異度空間症的機會，對
於購物樂趣的增加必有正面的效果。
(5)最佳化之虛擬商店空間辨識導覽輔助模式
虛擬環境打破了現實空間的限制，成了可程式化的場所後，在虛擬商店的消費過程中加
入了視覺化的要素，可以使消費者靠著自己的想像力瀏覽整個虛擬空間，經本研究探討

Abstract - Driver fatigue is recognized as an important
factor in road accidents in worldwide. The fatigue-tracking
technologies to prevent fatigue-related accidents have been
widely discussed in the last decade. There is some evidence
to suggest that subjective measures of fatigue do
indeed correlate with performance decrements
associated with fatigue. However, it is difficult to
measure on-line. The study investigated the effect of
tendency indices for actual driving performance
measuring. A fatigue driving detecting model was
proposed based on neural-fuzzy approach integrating
driving performance measuring variables and
tendency indices. This study has been performed using
experimental data coming from 50 drivers. Results
show that the model could achieve the same effect as
subjective ratings.
Keywords–Fatigue, momentum indices, neuro-fuzzy
I. INTRODUCTION
Fatigue has been identified as a major contributor to
traffic crashes in worldwide. Studies have estimated that
up to 37% of all motor vehicle fatalities involve a fatigued
or sleepy driver in the United States [1]. In Europe,
Approximately one fourth to one third of road accidents
are related to driver drowsiness [2]. There are some
researches found that fatigue has been estimated to be
involved in 2% to 23% of all crashes [3,4]. The
degradation in driving performance because of fatigue was
reported by Shinar to account for a small, but significant,
percent of highway accidents [5]. Among long-haul
commercial drivers, who often must drive long hours,
fatigue can be a significant cause of accidents. The Bureau
of Motor Carrier Safety, for example, investigated 286
commercial vehicle accidents and found that 38 percent of
them were categorized as atributable to the driver’s being 
either fatigue at the wheel or inattentive [6]. Although
heavy travel volumes certainly play a role in the high
accident rates, especially over busy three-day weekends,
most experts agree that another factor is likely a cause:
increased driver fatigue attributed to lengthy driving hours,
lack of sleep, and the demands of holiday activities. What
is known for certain is that driver fatigue already poses
one of the leading threats to safety on the driving road.
According to estimates from the American National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, at least 100,000
vehicle crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,500 fatalities each
year can be directly attributed to it. Some researchers
consider these estimates to be conservative, asserting that
driver fatigue plays a significant role in the nearly
1,000,000 annual crashes that are increasingly susceptible
to accidents long before they actually fall asleep at the
wheel [7].
Today, researchers are still struggling with the
problem of how to monitor fatigue while fatigue. A look at
the literature reveals almost as many performance
variables as there are research articles dealing with the
issue. In another way, drivers have been forced to deal
with fatigue and its detrimental effects on driving
behavior and safety for many years. As a result, several
types of fatigue and drowsiness countermeasures have
been developed or suggested. These include: 1) federal
regulations for professional drivers; 2) simple remedies
such as singing or chewing gum; and 3) mechanical and
electronic detection and warning system [8]. The first two
types may not be very effective since they are seldom
enforced and hence, seldom obeyed. Therefore,
mechanical-electronic detection and warning systems are
discussed and designed by most investigators. Over the
years, there have been scientific and applied initiatives to
develop on-line measures of fatigue. However, this is a
fact that there is no accepted, single method of detection
for fatigue. If we apply tendency indices and inference
methodology to combine with mechanical-electronic
detection system, the measures of fatigue would be
effective. The objective of the present study was to
propose a fatigue driving detecting model developed on
neural-fuzzy approach integrating driving performance
measuring variables and tendency indices, could be
accurate and practical to apply on warning system.
II. METHOD
A. Measurement of Fatigue
In general, fatigue driving measurement techniques
are organized in terms of four major categories: 1) actual
driving performance measures; 2) physiological measures;
3)subsidiary task performance measures; and 4) subjective
ratings [8]. It should be noted at the outset that the interest
in physiological measures and subjective ratings is due
largely to their potential use as predictors of actual driving
performance. There is some evidence to suggest that
subjective measures of fatigue do indeed correlate with
performance decrements associated with fatigue [9].
However, actual driving performance measures have
表 Y04
Therefore, the experiment executed at mid-afternoon (2.00
p.m. ~ 3.00 p.m.). In the first hour, subjects performed
practice run and the task used for fatigue induction.
During fatigue induction, subjects performed a demanding
character detection task in addition to following a lead
vehicle at constant speed (40 m.p.h.). Participants were
asked to complete a subjective fatigue scale by
questionnaire after practice (‘pre-drive’), and after the
main drive (‘post-drive’). The questionnaire includes
20-item fatigue symptoms rate on 0-5 numerical scales.
The symptoms were modified from Matthews and
Desmond’s Fatigue Rating Scales, four items (including
hearing ability reduced, feel stomach pains, feel ill and
feel sick or nauseous) were deleted owing to low scores
[16]. These symptoms relate to three aspects of fatigue:
physical symptoms, perceptual symptoms and boredom of
task motivation.
C.2 Results
Fig. 1 shows the distribution of subjective ratings of
these 50 participants. The mean value is 56.84 and mode
value is 60. Therefore, the task of fatigue induction was
significant. Fig. 2 presents line charts of RSI, KSL and
MACD for driving performance-measuring variables (for
the 95th percentile participant) on a 65 minutes sequence
of the circuit experiment. The participant’s subjective
fatigue rating score was 72 and in a significant fatigue
state. We found that the line of RSI oscillates too fast and
the sensitivity of MACD is insignificant for this
participant. The trend of fatigue state is not easy to
adjudge. However, the %K line and %D line of 12 periods
KDL of speed became smooth and closed significantly
from the 54th minute, and continued about 11 minutes until
experiment complement. Simultaneously, it happened in
the variable of steering wheel angle. The %K line and %D
line became smooth and closed significantly from the 60th
minute. However, the trend of lateral position was not
significant. It means that the variability of driver’s activity
on speed and steering wheel angle decreases in fatigue
state. The results consisted with findings of Muto and
Wierwille [17, 18]. Muto and Wierwille found a
significant decrease in small steering wheel reversals over
prolonged driving periods of 30, 60, or 150 minutes as
compared to before prolonged driving and baseline runs.
Therefore, the 12 periods KDL was used to develop a
neural-fuzzy fatigue driving detecting model.

D.4 Optimization
A fuzzyTECH tool was used to optimize the input
fuzzy sets. It is an adaptive-network-based fuzzy
inference system, which applies neural-fuzzy technique
to achieve a desired input-output mapping based on both
human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy if-then rules)
and stipulated input-output data pairs [22]. These
parameters are updated according to given training data.
Fig. 4 shows the membership function of input fuzzy sets
and Fig. 5 shows characteristic converting surface for
relationship among speed, steering wheel angle and
fatigue rating after 651 time steps of adaptation. The
results show that the average percentage error converges
at 0.68% and the average confidence level of
membership functions of fuzzy set S~ is 0.98, fuzzy set
P~ is 0.91 and fuzzy set A~ is 0.96.
III. CONCLUSION
Vehicle-based performance technologies for
evaluating driving fatigue tend to be complex and are
challenging to develop and implement. The complexity
of implementation is largely due to different driver
behaviors between individuals. There is some evidence
to suggest that subjective measures of fatigue do indeed
correlate with performance decrements associated with
fatigue. However, it is difficult to measure on-line. In
this study, we found that: 1) the tendency index –12
periods KDL is more sensitive for actual driving
performance measuring; 2) lateral position, steering
wheel angle and vehicle speed, no matter which, the
duration of when 5%%  DK of these driving
performance is longer, the subjective ratings of fatigue is
more significant. Appling neural-fuzzy approach
integrating these characteristics to develop a fatigue
driving detecting model could achieve the same effect as
subjective ratings. The methodology presented in this
paper should be useful in fatigue warning system
developing.

Abstract: In this study, a fuzzy control massage seat for combating driver fatigue was developed. First, we combined actual driving
performance with tendency index to predict the tendency of driver fatigue, and found that the 12 periods KDL (stochastic oscillators) of
momentum of speed and steering wheel angle are better for detecting driver fatigue. Second, a fuzzy control technology was used to develop
the fatigue driving detecting system, which integrates fuzzy logic reasoning and neural network learning. Finally, the fatigue driving
detecting system was further developed to control massage seat for combating driver fatigue. The experiment results showed that the fatigue
driving detecting system correlated well with subjective fatigue ratings had good effect of fatigue detection, and could efficiently control
massage seat to alert subjects for keeping concentration on traffic conditions. The massage seat could reduce marginally some symptom of
fatigue.
Keywords: driver fatigue; fuzzy control; momentum index; prolonged attention; massage seat.
1 INTRODUCTION
Driving an automobile is a very complex task, which
requires that the operator constantly attend and respond to
the driving environment to maintain proper control of the
vehicle. In fact, driver fatigue has been identified as a major
contributor to traffic crashes in worldwide. In Europe,
Approximately one fourth to one third of road accidents are
related to driver drowsiness (Dangelmaier et al., 2003).
There are some researches found that fatigue has been
estimated to be involved in 2% to 23% of all crashes (Horne
and Reyner, 1995; Maycock, 1997). What is known for
certain is that driver fatigue already poses one of the leading
threats to safety on the driving road. According to estimates
from the American National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, at least 100,000 vehicle crashes, 71,000
injuries, and 1,500 fatalities each year can be directly
attributed to it. However, some researchers consider these
estimates to be conservative, asserting that driver fatigue
plays a significant role in the nearly 1,000,000 annual
crashes that are increasingly susceptible to accidents long
before they actually fall asleep at the wheel.
Today, researchers are still struggling with the problem
of how to monitor fatigue while fatigue. Over the years,
there have been scientific and applied initiatives to develop
on-line measures of fatigue. However, if only use single
method of detection for fatigue; this is a fact that the effects
are limited. If we apply tendency indices and inference
methodology to combine with mechanical-electronic
detection system, the effects of measures of fatigue might be
effective. The objective of the present study was to propose
a fatigue driving detecting model developed on neural-fuzzy
approach integrating driving performance measuring
variables and tendency indices, which could be accurate and
practical to apply on detecting system to control massage
seat for combating driver fatigue.
2 DETECTION OF DRIVER FATIGUE
In general, there are four classes of fatigue detection and
prediction technologies: 1) readiness-to-perform and
fitness-for-duty; 2) mathematical models of alertness; 3)
vehicle-based performance; and 4) Driver’s current state
(Dinges and Mallis, 1998). On the other hand, Wierwille
and Ellsworth (1994) found that subjective evaluation of
drowsiness is a comprehensive measure of driver fatigue,
but subjective ratings are not easily measured on-line and
most in post-drive. In fact, vehicle-based performance
measures have generally shown promise as predictors of
driver impairment, since these measures have many
advantages (e.g., no wires, devices, or monitors on or aimed
at an operator) and can be practically implemented in
conjunction with a monitoring and alerting device, but their
scientific validity remain to be demonstrated as with all
fatigue measuring technologies (Mallis, 1999). For example,
Ma and Kaber used lane deviation and speed control to
evaluate the situation awareness and workload in driving
while using adaptive cruise control and a cell phone (Ma
fatiguing drive, and showed a high degree of internal
consistency. In this study, there are four items (including
hearing ability reduced, feel stomach pains, feel ill and feel
sick or nauseous) were deleted, owing to these symptoms
are fewer occurrence in fatigue driving.
2.2.2 Results
The results showed that the mean value of subjective fatigue
rating was 56.84 and mode value was 60 in post-drive.
Figure 1 presents line charts of RSI, KSL and MACD for
driving performance-measuring variables of the 95th
percentile participant in this experiment about 65 minutes.
The participant’s total subjective fatigue rating score was 72
and in a significant fatigue state. We found that the line of
RSI oscillates too fast and the sensitivity of MACD is
insignificant for this participant. The trend of fatigue state is
not easy to adjudge by RSI and MACD. However, the %K
line and %D line of 12 periods KDL of vehicle speed
became smooth and closed significantly from the 54th
minute (i.e. 5%%  DK ), and continued about 11
minutes until experiment complement. The results also
showed that the mean duration of when 5%%  DK
on 12 periods KDL of speed was 5.2 minutes for the
participants whose fatigue rating score was bigger than 50.
Simultaneously, the %K line and %D line became smooth
and closed significantly from the 60th minute on 12 periods
KDL of steering wheel angle. The mean duration of when
5%%  DK was 3.9 minutes for the participants whose
fatigue rating score was bigger than 50. However, the KDL
trend of lateral position was not significant. It means that
the momentum of driver’s activity on vehicle speed and
steering wheel angle is on the decrease when fatigue. The
results consisted with findings of Muto and Wierwille (Muto
and Wierwille, 1982). They found a significant decrease in
small steering wheel reversals over prolonged driving
periods of 30, 60, or 150 minutes as compared to before
prolonged driving and baseline runs. Therefore, the 12
periods KDL of momentum of speed and steering wheel
angle were used to develop a fuzzy fatigue detecting system.
3 FUZZY FATIGUE-DRIVE DETECTING SYSTEM
3.1 System Development
In this study a fuzzy technology was used to develop the
fatigue driving detecting system, which integrates fuzzy
logic reasoning and neural network learning (Djukanovic et
al., 1997). The fuzzy logic reasoning is based on the concept
of fuzzy set theory. A fuzzy set is the best thought of as an
extension of the traditional set theory in which elements
either do or do not belong to a given set. Because a clear
boundary exists between set members and non-members,
traditional sets are often referred to as crisp sets (Campbell
and Massaro, 1997; Kasko, 1997). However, it would seem
more appropriate to distinguish between levels of events
rather than to assign every event to either member sets or
non-member sets. For example, if we abruptly define the
duration of when 5%%  DK of vehicle speed
exceeding 7 min. is in serious fatigue, the driver should be
warned or stop driving. Why is it that a “7.1 min.” is 
completely “serious,” while a “6.9 min.” is “moderate” 
not “serious”at all? Therefore, the fuzzy sets used to
develop a detecting system should be adapted. In phase 1,
fuzzy sets were used to develop the fatigue drive detecting
system. The initial two inputs and one output membership
were constructed in the system. First, we defined two input
variables: fuzzy set )(xS and )(yA .

3.2 The second experiment
3.2.1 Experiment design
In order to verify the effects of the fuzzy control massage
seat for detecting and combating driver fatigue, the second
experiment was conducted. The environment and procedure
of the second experiment are the same as the first. However,
in the second experiment, subjects must perform a
demanding character detection task for evaluating subjects’
fatigue on concentration and dullness. When the experiment
carried on about 50 minutes, a series of 30 road-signs were
presented to subjects, at a distance of 80 meters apart.
Subjects were required to detect target sign which shows 60
kilometers of speed limits, and to press the button set on the
steering wheel when they detected the target. There are 50
subjects participate the second experiment and randomly
assigned to one of two groups: the fuzzy control massage
seat group and the control group. No subject had experience
participating in the first experiment and all had a valid
driver’s license. Participants were also asked to complete a
subjective fatigue scale by questionnaire after main drive.
3.2.2 Results and discussion
Table 2 shows the two group subjects’responses on
detecting traffic signs test, d’value and subjective fatigue
rating. Pawlaczyk-Luszczynska et al. (2005) successfully
used signal detection tests to find that low frequency noise
at moderate levels might adversely affect concentration.
Drake (1991) reported that the use of statistics based on
signal detection theory is valid to measure concentration by
continuous recognition memory test. Therefore, the signal
detection theory (SDT) was used to measure the degree of
subjects’poor concentration and dullness caused by fatigue.
The theory of signal detection (SDT) is a model of
perceptual processing that is often used to characterize
performance effectiveness in signal detection situations
because it permits the derivation of independent measures of
perceptual sensitivity (Kenneth et al. 1986; Wickens, 1992).
In SDT terms, sensitivity is measured by the degree of
separation between the two distributions (signals and noises).
The sensitivity measure is called d’and corresponds to the
separation of the two distributions expressed in units of
standard deviations. We assumed that people in high fatigue
will be in poor concentration and dullness, and weaker and
less distinct the target signal, the smaller d’will be
(Parasuraman et al., 2000).
By a test of differences of means, the means of
sensitivity index d’of subjects based on fuzzy control
massage seat is significantly larger than no system (t =
1.98347 > t (0.95, 48) = 1.67722 and P(T<=t)=0.02653).
The linear correlation coefficient between index d’and
subjective fatigue rating is -0.79018. The d’measures which
correlate well with subjective fatigue rating, when d’is
smaller, the subjective fatigue rating will be higher and
symptom of fatigue will be more serious. The results
confirmed our expectation that fuzzy control massage seat
for detecting and combating driver fatigue would be
significantly better than no detecting system. On the other
hand, the mean subjective fatigue rating based on fuzzy
control massage seat is 50.88 and no system is 54.88, the
mean based on fuzzy control system is margin significantly
smaller than no system (t = 1.458443 < t (0.95, 48) =
1.67722 and P(T<=t)=0.075616). The results showed that
the fuzzy control massage seat could efficiently detect
driver fatigue and alert subjects for keeping concentration
on traffic conditions and marginally reduce some symptom
of fatigue.
