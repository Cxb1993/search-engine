Abstract 
This project is devoted to the study of 
employing quarter-wavelength (λ/4) and λ/2 
two-section or three-section stepped 
-impedance resonators (SIRs) in the design 
of new microwave multi-band bandpass 
filters (BPFs) and multi-layered BPFs. The 
efforts are placed on new structure 
development, performance improvement, 
circuit miniaturization, and study of new 
signal-feeding configurations of the BPFs. In 
the first year, several dual-band BPFs and 
some of the proposed tri-band BPFs have 
been successfully designed and verified.  
For development of the tri-band BPFs, 
an BPF configuration using single feed to 
the combined SIRs was studied in the first 
year. The combined SIRs shared part of the 
strip segments which connect the feed point 
and the ground. The proposed tri-band BPF 
provides three passbands that can be freely 
chosen for applications, and was measured 
to show good BPF performance. In the 
second year, a tri-band BPF designed using 
TSSIR with a cross-coupled configuration 
and a quad-band BPF constructed using 
combined λ/4 SIRs are investigated and 
implemented. The former shows very good 
selectivity characteristics at the three 
designated passbands, while the latter has a 
relatively compact circuit size and good 
multi-band performance.  
For the study of multi-layered BPFs, 
we have accomplished the design of a 
dual-band BPF by placing the microstrip

can be obtained by setting zero (for odd modes) 
or infinity (for even modes) the impedance Zin. 
With all three sections of the TSSIR assumed 
to have the same electric length (i.e., 
1θ = 2θ = 3θ = 0θ ), the electric lengths for the first 
three resonant modes of the TSSIR can be 
derived as [10]

The filter circuit is to be designed on a 
0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate 
with a dielectric constant of 10.2 and a loss 
tangent of 0.0023. For the designated passband 
center frequencies, the corresponding 
impedance ratios can be calculated to be K1 = 
2.03 and K2 = 1.66. With the width of the line 
section having the characteristic impedance Z2 
pre-selected to be 0.5 mm (which corresponds 
to Z2 = 33.5 Ω ),  the characteristic 
impedances of the other two line sections can 
be determined to be Z1 = 20.2 Ω  and Z3 = 68 
Ω . Moreover, the electric length of each line 
section at 1.57 GHz can be calculated to be 
01θ  = 40.28o.

Fig. 3. Configuration of the proposed 
tri-band BPF. 
Fig. 3 shows the geometry of the 
proposed second-order tri-band microstrip 
BPF. To improve the passband selectivity, the 
designed BPF adopts a cross-coupled 
configuration to produce a zero near each 
passband edge. Each transmission zero occurs 
because of the cancellation of the transmitted 
signals going through the two different paths. 
The two signal paths incurred from this 
cross-coupled configuration are also indicated 
in Fig. 3. 
After a few iterations in the optimization 
process, the structural parameters for this 
prototype BPF circuit are found to be L1 = 
7.15, L2 = 4.81, L3 = 2.17, L4 = 1.4, L5 = 2, L6 
=15.5, L7 = 4, L8 = 2.17, L9 = 0.75, L10 = 9.12, 
L11 = 8.595, L12 = 4.08, L13 = 4.61, W1 = 1.86, 
W2 = 0.5, W3 = 0.23, W4 = 0.2, S1 = 0.65, S2 = 
0.2, and S3 = 0.89 (all units are in mm). Fig. 4 
shows the simulated and measured frequency 
responses of the S-parameters of the designed 
tri-band BPF. The measured results are in very 
good agreement with those obtained from 
 6 
1 2Δi iM g g= . Once the values of iM  are 
known, we can determine the gaps between 
these two resonators through full-wave 
electromagnetic simulation. The 
corresponding coupling coefficients ( 1AM , 
1BM , 2AM , 2BM ) obtained from simulation 
results are approximately (0.0453, 0.052, 
0.062, 0.0794) and the fractional bandwidths 
( 1AΔ , 1BΔ , 2AΔ , 2BΔ ) computed from 
1 2Δi iM g g=  are (6.39%, 7.4%, 8.8%, 
11.23%).    
   Again the filter circuit is to be designed on 
a 0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. 
The structural parameters are W1= 1.4, W2 = 
0.15, W3 = 0.2, S1 = 0.6, S2 = 0.3, D = 0.6, L1a 
= 1.8, L1b = 8, L1c = 4.3, L1d = 1, L2a = 0.67, 
L2b = 1.19, L2c = 1.5, L2d = 1.29, L2e = 5.54, 
L2f = 3.03, L3a = 2, L3b = 3.2, L3c = 1.4, L3d = 
2.3, L3e = 0.7, and L3f = 0.8, all units are in 
millimeter. The measured 3-dB frequency 
ranges (fractional bandwidths) for the four 
passbands centered at 1Af , 1Bf , 2Af , and 
2Bf  are found to be 1510-1610 MHz (6.4%), 
2340-2540 MHz (8.2%), 3400-3710 MHz 
(8.7%), and 4920-5560 MHz (12.2%), 
respectively. The minimum insertion losses 
measured for these four passbands in the same 
sequence are 1.85, 1.4, 2, and 1.06 dB, 
respectively.

(3) Design of Dual-Band Bandpass 
Filter Incorporating Tri-Section SIRs 
and CPW SIR 
The third filter circuit designed in this 
project was a compact dual-band BPF that is 
intended for WLAN applications at the 2.45- 
and 5.25-GHz bands. The proposed BPF, as 
shown in Fig. 7, is constructed using two λ/2 
microstrip tri-section SIRs (TSSIRs) and two 
λ/4 coplanar-waveguide (CPW) SIRs printed 
on the opposite sides of the substrate. The first 
two resonant frequencies of the λ/2 TSSIRs 
are designed around 2.45 and 5.25 GHz. It 
was proven in the literature that the total 
electric length of the λ/2 TSSIR can be 
designed shorter than that of a conventional 
λ/2 SIR. On the other hand, the first resonant 
frequency of the λ/4 CPW SIRs is chosen 
around 5.25 GHz. Without the need of 
constructing vias, the λ/4 CPW SIRs can be 
formed simply by etching slots from the 
ground plane. Resonators in this dual-band 
BPF are arranged in a cross-coupled fashion 
and placed in a close-proximity manner to 
establish appropriate couplings. For passband 
selectivity improvement, a cross-coupling 
path is established by connecting an 
anti-parallel-coupled line section to the input 
and output feed lines. A prototype of the 
proposed BPF is fabricated and measured to 
verify this dual-band BPF design.

be roughly equally spaced in the UWB 
passband to obtain wide-band response. The 
MMR is coupled to the input/output CPW feed 
lines. With the gaps of the CPW widened, the 
coupling between the MMR and the CPW feed 
lines can be greatly enhanced. In addition, 
with the center signal line of the CPW split, 
the inner ground corner properly canted, and 
an additional coupling line section placed 
beside the MMR, the overall frequency 
response can be further improved.

Fig. 9. Schematics of proposed UWB 
BPF: (a) top view and (b) bottom view. 
As shown in Fig. 9, the filter circuit is 
printed on the two sides of the substrate. On 
the top of the substrate is an MMR along with 
a closely spaced coupling line section. On the 
bottom of the substrate are two modified CPW 
feeds. Besides retaining the feature of an 
isolated λ/4 SIR, this MMR also contains an 
embedded half-wavelength (λ/2) uniform- 
impedance resonator (UIR). In this design, the 
filter will be implemented on a 
0.635-mm-thick RT/Duroid 6010 substrate. 
With W1 = 0.1, W2 = 0.6, W3 = 1.2, L1 = 4.145, 
L2 = 3.63, L3 = 1.47, S = 0.125, and D = 0.95 
(all in millimeter), the MMR, when gap 
coupled to the two 50- Ω  microstrip ports, are 
simulated (using Ansoft HFSS) to have five 
transmission poles in the 2-20 GHz range, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 10. In this figure, 1f  = 
3.58 GHz, 2f  = 10.48 GHz, and 3f  = 16.65 
GHz pertain to the first three resonant 
frequencies of the inherent λ/4 SIR; 4f  = 
6.61 GHz and 5f  = 19.52 GHz correspond to 
the first and the third resonant frequency of 
the embedded 2λ  UIR. The 2λ  UIR, 
when isolated from the MMR, was simulated 
to resonate at 6.6, 13, and 19.4 GHz. The 
second resonant mode of the embedded 2λ  
UIR, having a voltage peak at its center, is 
suppressed because the arm connecting the 
center of the UIR to the via has an electric 
length of roughly 0.49 λ  at 13 GHz. Among 
these five transmission poles, only 1f , 4f , 
and 2f  are inside the UWB passband 
 
Fig. 10. Simulated frequency responses of the 
combined-SIR-based MMR. 
It can be inferred from many of the 
previous MMR-based UWB filter designs that 
strong coupling between the MMRs and the 
input/output port is a must. As shown in Fig. 9, 
the CPW differs from a conventional one in 
three respects: the ground of CPW recedes to 
enlarge its distance to the signal line of the 
CPW, the signal line of the CPW is split, and 
the inner ground corner at the position where 
the ground starts to recede is canted. It was 
known that the defect ground can enhance the
