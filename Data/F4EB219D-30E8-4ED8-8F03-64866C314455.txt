Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to investigate the power quality and reliability (PQR) of the smart 
micro-grid (SMG) with distributed generation (DG) and distributed storage (DS) units. By applying 
advanced sensing systems, communication systems as well as control technologies, electric power 
can be effectively, economically and safely provided to the critical customers. First, the distribution 
systems of Taipower will be selected and studied carefully. It is important to investigate the 
operating characteristics of wind power to set up their mathematical models and control block 
diagrams. Also, the tie line tripping settings for various micro grids will be studied according to the 
on-line operation scenario. To ensure the PQR of the micro grid, it is necessary to install 
compensation equipments like STATCOM and BES. Transient stability analyses are then performed 
to ensure stable operation of the various SMG operating areas by considering different types of 
customers, DGs, compensation equipments and conventional load shedding scheme. From these 
simulation results, the adaptive load shedding based on the artificial neural network (ANN) 
algorithm is therefore proposed to fit any micro-grid operation. The results of the project will be 
able to provide the analysis, planning and operation strategies of SMG for DG and DS 
manufacturers as well as utilities.

第二章 模型建立與卸載策略 
 
2.1 分散式電源模型建立 
分散式電源可分為再生能源與非再生能源發電，再生能源發電包括風力、太陽能、生質
能、海洋能等發電系統，而非再生能源發電包括汽電共生、燃料電池等發電系統，本節介紹
風力發電系統的基本架構與相關控制模式。 
風力發電系統是藉由空氣流動帶動風力機旋轉，而將動能轉換成電能，圖 2.1 為風力電
廠之基本架構圖[5]，其包括風力發電機、輸配電系統及監控系統，其中風力發電機包括葉片
轉子、發電機、增速裝置、控制系統、塔架及機艙等設備；輸配電系統主要包括變壓器及輸
配電電纜、配電盤、補償電容器及電源轉換設備；監控系統則包含主電腦、遠端控制器及通
訊系統。 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
圖 2.1 風力發電系統之基本架構圖 
 
葉片轉子為利用風力機轉換風能最重要的系統之一，葉片受風吹之氣動力作用，繞轂軸
旋轉，以擷取風的動能，進而轉換成有效的機械能和電能，而風能作用於葉片轉子上的平均
機械轉矩可表示為[5] 
lblrp= /),(CpUR5.0T 23W  (2.1) 
其中 ρ：空氣密度、U：風速、CP：風能功率轉換係數、λ：頂端速度比、β：葉片角度、
R：轉子葉片之旋轉半徑。依照風力發電系統之旋轉電機與電網併聯的應用方式，可歸類成
定轉速度和變動速度兩種發電運轉模式。定轉速度模式主要是透過齒輪變速機和感應發電機
轉子的機械耦合，控制轉子旋轉速度運轉於電網之系統額定頻率，故此種發電機組型式可以
與電網直接作連接。圖 2.2 所示為本計畫使用之風機輸入機械功率在不同轉速及風速的相對

2.3電池儲能模型建立 
常見的能源儲存方式有使用蓄電池、抽蓄、飛輪、空氣壓縮、超導磁能、熱能及氫儲能
等，本計畫使用電池儲能系統。電池儲存設備在電力系統發電量大於負載量時，可將多餘的
電力儲存起來，在適當的時間或發電量不足時，將電力送回饋線以穩定系統。圖 2.6 為電池
儲能系統模型之實功率控制架構圖，一般電池儲能系統透過一個電壓源轉換器併入系統，藉
由調整電池端電壓來控制電池儲能系統向系統吸收或放出實功率[9]。PAUX 為電池儲能模型
的實功率控制訊號，PINIT 為電池儲能模型初始輸出實功率，於穩態情況下一般設定為 0。實
功率模型架構主要包括儲能系統實功率、電流及電壓上下限制，其作用主要是讓電池儲能運
轉於正常控制範圍內。

第三章 含風機之配電系統併聯運轉分析 
 
本章選擇一台電實際配電系統為研究對象，在風力發電機組輸出端併聯靜態同步補償器
(STATCOM)，用以維持配電饋線端電壓，探討當鄰近配電饋線發生故障時，STATCOM 之補
償效益；並且根據風機及敏感性負載之低電壓容忍曲線及其故障臨界清除時間，決定此饋線
與配電系統之解聯時機，以確保風力發電機不致因系統故障而導致跳脫。 
 
3.1台電配電系統說明 
圖 3.1所示為經 OMS、拓樸分析與節點簡化後所獲得之實際台電配電饋線單線圖，此系
統為台電苗栗日南二次變電所(S/S)，其主變壓器額定容量為 25MVA、電壓 69kV/11.4kV、阻
抗 9%。變電所 69kV 側短路容量為 866MVA。主饋線之供電線路分別由地下線電纜
3C500XP2、架空線 3A477XPW 及 3C100mm2 等所組成。風力發電機經由一額定電壓比為
690V/11.4kV，額定容量為 1.84MVA，阻抗值為 6%之升壓變壓器併聯於日春線(UA28)匯流排
B9處，由於此風力發電機為鼠籠式感應發電機，故使用一容量為 550kvar之固定電容器與風
機併聯，作為補償虛功用，此外考慮在風力發電系統與配電系統倂接點併聯一靜態同步補償
器。 
圖 3.2為饋線七月尖峰日之饋線口實功率與虛功率變化曲線，最大負載量出現在 12時的
4078kW，此時之虛功率為 1340kvar。圖 3.3為二月離峰日饋線口實功率與虛功率變化曲線，
最小負載量出現在 14 時的 1010kW，此時之虛功率為 332kvar。由於主變壓器的尖峰最大實
功率為 16100kW，而研究饋線尖峰最大實率為 4078kW，故可估算出其它三條饋線之尖峰總
實功率為 11900kW，同理離峰時最低實功率為 4009kW，故其它三條饋線總實功率為
3000kW。在尖峰時段，饋線口會投入一 5Mvar的電容器組。 
當系統發生擾動或故障時，會造成電壓驟降，為確保在電壓驟降期間風機仍能維持正常
運轉與風機之安全性，在必要時須將風力發電機切離系統，因此風力發電機對於此電壓驟降
的忍受能力就成了一項重要課題。圖 3.4 所示為美國聯邦能源調整委員會(FERC)提出之風機
低壓忍受能力要求曲線(low voltage ride-through, LVRT) [12]，此規範之重點為風力發電機必須
可以忍受電壓降至 0.15pu並持續 0.625秒而不致與電網解聯。本計畫將根據此規範，模擬故
障發生後，風力發電機端電壓可於 3 秒內恢復至 0.9pu 之故障臨界清除時間(critical clearing 
time, CCT)，並比較不同 STATCOM容量對於臨界清除時間的影響，以及各風速下之故障臨界
清除時間。 
 
 
 10
 
圖 3.4風機低電壓忍受曲線 
 
3.2故障臨界清除時間 
若系統由於故障導致電壓下降，將使得感應發電機的輸出最大轉矩與風機輸入機械轉矩
相同，此時之系統電壓稱為臨界故障電壓。若系統電壓低於感應機之臨界故障電壓，將使得
感應機的輸出最大轉矩低於風機之輸入轉矩，則風機轉速會持續上升，若在風機達到臨界清
除轉速之前，系統電壓可即時恢復正常，則風機轉速將會下降而恢復正常運轉，感應發電機
仍可維持輸出電力正常供電；反之，若系統電壓未能在感應機之臨界清除時間恢復，則風機
將會迅速加速而消耗大量之無效功率，且無法輸出電力至系統，此時，必須將風機切離系統
[12]。 
假設風速為 14公尺/秒，且日春線之尖峰最大實功率為 4078kW，當故障發生於日春線外
部，風機端電壓之暫態響應如圖 3.5所示，風機端電壓最低降至 0.18pu。假設故障於 0.25秒
後清除，則風機端電壓仍可迅速上升至 0.8pu，且在 3秒內回復至 0.9pu以上而維持正常運轉；
當故障清除時間為 0.27秒，則風機轉速將持續上升而造成失速，且因感應發電機消耗大量虛
功，使得風機端電壓無法恢復正常運轉，針對此故障事例可找出風機故障之臨界清除時間即
為 0.25秒。圖 3.6為風機出口端有無併聯 STATCOM之故障臨界清除時間曲線，當 STATCOM
容量為 3MVA，風機於系統發生任何故障下，其故障臨界清除時間均可藉由併聯 STATCOM
而延長 0.08秒以上，如圖中曲線 2，由圖可看出若 STATCOM之容量越大則故障臨界清除時
間越長。

當風速變動情況如圖 3.9所示時，STATCOM對電壓穩定之效果與其輸出之虛功補償波形
分別如圖 3.10與圖 3.11所示。圖中第 5秒至第 10秒時，風速為 8公尺/秒，未倂聯 STATCOM
時倂接點之電壓約為 0.979pu。加入 STATCOM後，STATCOM向系統注入 0.65 Mvar之虛功
率，將電壓提升至 0.997pu。未倂聯 STATCOM時，系統電壓會隨著風速變動而擾動，此擾動
會影響一些敏感性負載，經由 STATCOM的併聯可有效改善電壓擾動的問題，使風機在風速
變動較為劇烈時，亦可維持電壓之穩定，且可抑制因風速變動瞬間所造成的振盪現象[13]。

第四章 含風機之配電系統孤島運轉分析 
 
當饋線微電網外部台電系統發生重大故障，且無法及時排除而必須解聯形成孤島運轉
時，必要時須執行卸載策略來維持風力發電機組之持續運轉，以可提高配電微電網系統供電
可靠度。因此風機除了必須在故障臨界清除時間前與故障隔離，使配電系統形成一微電網作
孤島運轉之外，若微電網內的負載量小於風機發電量，則必須適當調整風機葉片角度，以控
制微電網獨立運轉之系統頻率及風機轉速，當配電系統負載量大於風機輸出功率時，將會造
成獨立微電網系統頻率迅速下跌，則須採取正確的卸載措施，以避免風力發電機組跳脫，造
成整個微電網系統斷電。因此在完成微電網之及時解聯後，控制系統必須隨微電網系統之運
轉條件，快速決定適當的卸載量，才能確保微電網系統正常的孤島運轉。而卸載量之多寡將
視微電網系統解聯前之負載量，以及當時風速與風機之輸出功率而定，所以本章以風速及配
電系統之負載量作為類神經網路之輸入資料，以決定微電網於解聯後之卸載量。 
 
4.1不同卸載量對孤島系統的影響 
為了快速決定微電網系統適當的卸載量，使風機轉速能夠恢復穩定運轉，本文假設系統
故障時之風速為 14m/s，且日春線負載量為 3500kW，功率因數 0.95落後，利用暫態穩定度模
擬於日春線外部發生三相接地故障，且故障未能及時清除，根據風機轉子轉速穩定度分析，
決定風機之故障臨界清除時間為 0.3s，亦即在故障發生 0.3s後，斷路器 CB1打開，使日春饋
線與台電系統解聯，且在解聯同時進行卸載。圖 4.1及圖 4.2所示分別為風機轉子轉速及葉片
角度的響應，於故障期間由於系統電壓下降，導致風力發電機之輸出功率小於輸入機械功率，
因此風機轉速持續上升，為了提高風機之故障忍受能力，除了以靜態同步補償器調整風機端
電壓，延長風機之故障臨界清除時間，且考慮風力機組葉片角度控制系統，以最快每秒 10度
來調高葉片角度，以減少風機輸入機械功率，將可改善風機之暫態響應。在此饋線微電網完
成與台電系統解聯後，則改變風機之運轉模式，以轉速來控制風機之輸出電力，同時執行卸
載，曲線 1 對應之卸載量為 1680kW，由於卸載量不足，導致饋線之剩餘負載量仍然大於風
機輸出功率，所以造成風機轉速持續下降，曲線 5 之卸載量為 2200kW，由於卸載量過多，
使得風機輸出功率大於負載量，但經由葉片控制系統增加葉片之角度為 4.5 度，以降低風機
輸出功率而與負載量達到平衡，此微電網系統將可恢復穩定運轉，若切除之卸載量為 1720kW
時，風機響應如曲線 2，風機葉片角度可恢復至 0 度，使風機產生最大電力輸出，且風機轉
速亦可迅速恢復至 1.0p.u.，以維持配電孤島系統穩定運轉。當日春饋線運轉在不同負載量，
且風機輸出功率隨風速 10m/s 至 15m/s 之變化而作變動，經暫態穩定度模擬後之配電微電網
適當卸載量如表 4.1所示。

4.2含類神經網路卸載之孤島系統運轉 
上一節推導出在不同風速與負載量下之最適卸載量表格，以此表作為類神經網路之輸入
與輸出訓練資料，經 L-M 倒傳遞法訓練此類神經網路，其訓練誤差性能指標曲線可收斂至
10-5，如圖 4.5所示。表 4.2為日春饋線微電網於工作日運轉時之適應性卸載策略，經類神經
網路計算饋線於不同時段發生故障時，微電網解聯後之卸載量如表 4.2之 Pneural所示，於早上
8 時風機輸出功率大於饋線負載量，因此不需卸載，其他時段，則必須根據類神經網路來進
行卸載，其中在早上 11時所需之卸載量最大，其值為 2455kW，為了測試類神經網路訓練後
之準確度，經暫態穩定度分析所決定之卸載量如表中之 Pshed，其誤差率在 2 時、5 時及 6 時
之誤差高達 6%之上，為了提高類神經網路之準確度，增加饋線 24小時之實際運轉資料，並
經暫態穩定度分析相對應之卸載量，輸入類神經網路程式重新訓練，其誤差率則可降至低於
2%。

第五章 含風機與電池儲能之獨立電網運轉分析 
 
本章以金門電力系統為研究對象，探討其在不同柴油發電機數目時，若風機輸出電力由
滿載降至零輸出時，對系統的擾動狀況。另外，模擬風場輸出因風速變化而造成功率輸出變
化時，藉由此電池儲能系統的控制，達到穩定電力系統之目的。 
 
5.1獨立電網系統概述 
金門系統是一個獨立的電力系統[14]，與台灣本島無相互連接，即所謂的孤島運轉電力
系統。圖5.1所示為民國98年的金門電力系統架構示意圖，包括塔山與夏興電廠及塔山、莒光
與夏興三個主要變電站，其中塔山電廠擁有八部柴油發電機組，裝置容量分別為一期7.91MW
四部機組和二期8.25MW四部機組，另外夏興電廠則有六部柴油發電機組，裝置容量分別為
3.168MW兩部機組與3.512MW四部機組，總柴油發電機裝置容量為84.94MW。另外在金沙鎮
后扁有兩部Vestas V80的2MW風力發電機。 
 
 
 
圖5.1 金門電力系統架構圖 
 
金門地區發電系統之柴油發電機皆採用同步發電機，柴油發電機有熱效率高、起動迅速、
可以頻繁起停等優點。為執行暫態穩定度分析，須確定柴油發電機組之發電機、激磁機與引
擎調速機之數學模型和參數。塔山一期和夏興機組之激磁系統都是使用ESAC8B數學模型，
而塔山二期機組則是使用IEEEX2數學模型。此外，所有發電廠的調速機採用如圖5.2所示的模
型方塊圖。其中有一部機組置於定速(Isochronous)模式，其他發電機則置於速度下降(Droop)
模式運轉。

Isochronous模式的柴油機發電量從 4.67MW提升至 8.48MW後趨於穩定，其他 2部於 Droop
模式之柴油機最大上升至 5.98MW，最後因頻率回復至 60Hz，會回復至其初始發電量。

模式之發電量最大上升至 4.47MW，最後因頻率回復至 60Hz，也同樣回復至其初始發電量。

圖 5.9所示為有無考慮儲能系統之風機併接點電壓變化曲線，儲能系統併入後，於風速
增加時吸收實、虛功率，使風場電壓微幅升至 1.0509pu，較沒有儲能系統之事例低壓峰值降
低 0.0006pu；此外，在風速下降時，儲能系統會消耗實功率並減少吸收虛功率，使電壓下降
至 1.0503pu，較沒有儲能之事例電壓峰值提升了 0.0004pu。 
 
 
圖 5.9 有無併聯儲能系統之風機併接點電壓變化曲線圖 
 
圖 5.10所示為有無併聯儲能系統之頻率變化曲線，因風速上升，儲能系統吸收 0.1539MW
的實功率，最高頻率為 60.1Hz，與未併儲能系統之事例相比，頻率峰值降低了 0.1Hz；風速
下降時，儲能系統最多提供 0.1438MW的實功率，頻率最低降至 59.73Hz，與未併聯儲能系
統之事例相較，最低頻率提高了 0.15Hz。 
 
 
圖 5.10 有無併聯儲能系統之系統頻率變化曲線圖 
 
圖 5.11與圖 5.12為有無併聯儲能系統之風場提供之實功率與虛功率變化曲線，併入儲能
系統後，因陣風所造成的發電量驟升能有所改善，儲能系統吸收 0.15MW的實功率，使風場
輸出實功率降為 3.15MW；此時，消耗的最大虛功率亦由 0.21Mvar減少為 0.19Mvar。當風速
下降導致發電量驟降時，儲能系統提供 0.14MW的實功率使風場輸出實功率仍有 2.86MW。

第六章 結論與討論 
 
本計劃完成風力發電系統之運轉特性與控制模型研究，配合所建立的STATCOM控制模
型，以台電苗栗日南二次變電所之日春饋線為研究對象，探討風機對故障臨界清除時間與殘
存電壓的影響，經由上述的說明可知道，當配電饋線發生故障時，適當的調整風機葉片角度
及裝設STATCOM補償設備，均可有效改善風機端電壓及轉速恢復的時間，且STATCOM亦能
有效延長風機之故障臨界清除時間，增加風機的低壓忍受能力，降低風機損壞的機率。當故
障發生且配電饋線與台電系統解聯後，除了應用風力機組葉片角度控制系統外，須執行卸載
來穩定獨立系統的暫態響應，由於卸載量會隨著風速大小與負載量而有所差異，因此本計畫
推導出在不同風速與負載量下之最適卸載量表格，以此表作為類神經網路之輸入與輸出訓練
資料，經L-M倒傳遞法訓練此類神經網路，設計此一類神經網路適應性卸載策略，經由饋線
24小時之實際運轉分析，其最大誤差率可維持在7%以內。 
本計畫亦執行金門電力系統的暫態運轉分析，探討其在不同柴油發電機數目時，若風機
輸出電力由滿載降至零輸出時，對系統的擾動狀況。經由分析可知道，若同時考慮暫態響應
與柴油機組效率時，離峰運轉啟動3部柴油發電機配合是較合適的運轉模式。另外，本文亦模
擬風場功率輸出因風速變化而造成變化時，藉由此電池儲能系統的控制，來達到穩定電力系
統之目的，其效果相當顯著。

II. DESCRIPTION  OF ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM  
Fig. 2 shows the one line diagram of the steel 
cogeneration plant. For the power quality and reliability 
consideration, the steel cogeneration plant has to connect 
with Taipower system (bus B1) via double circuits of 
3.6km, 161-kV transmission lines. The dashed line 
enclosed area is the existing power system which includes 
a DC arc furnace served by transformer TR7 with a 33-kV 
voltage level as well as a ladle furnace and an H-beam 
plant served by transformer TR8 with a 22.8-kV voltage 
level. In addition, several equipments like blast furnaces, 
basic oxide furnaces and hot strip rolling will be installed 
for the expansion of the steel plant. It is therefore to 
construct six new 33-kV buses (B11-B16) to serve the new 
loads in the plant. The 33-kV buses will be connected to 
the incoming 161-kV bus B2 via step-down transformers 
TR1-TR6. By the way, many 11.5-kV buses are also built 
to receive the electric power through transformers T31-
T50. To make use of the waste gas which is the by product 
of the iron making and to enhance the reliability of power 
system, five steam turbines (TG1-TG5), two top pressure 
recovery turbines (TRT1-TRT2) and two coke dry 
quenching (CDQ1-CDQ2) type turbines are considered to 
drive the cogeneration units. The total rated generation 
capacity of all cogeneration units will reach 529MW in the 
integrated steel plant. Table I lists the parameters of the 
main transformers in the cogeneration plant.

III. POWER FLOW AND SHORT CIRCUIT ANALYSIS 
To ensure the power system of the integrated steel 
plant can be operated in a more effective manner under 
various normal operation scenarios, power flow analysis is 
applied to determine the parameters and setting values of 
the equipment. The short circuit analysis is also used for 
the calculation of fault current to ensure the safety of bus 
bars and the sufficient capacity of circuit breakers.  
3.1 Power Flow Analysis 
In this section, the operation scenario with total 
generation of 321MW and total loading demand of 
533MW is selected for computer simulation. The terminal 
voltage of cogeneration units is adjusted to be 1.01pu 
while the tap position of generator step-up transformers is 
set as 101.25%. Furthermore, many capacitor banks with a 
total capacity of 196Mvar are installed at different sites for 
reactive power compensation. It is found that all the bus 
voltages can be maintained within 0.970pu~1.012pu and 
the cogeneration plant has to import electric power of 
216MW from Taipower with a 0.964 lagging power factor 
at point of common coupling (PCC) to meet total load 
demand in the plant. All equipments can be operated 
within their rating capabilities. However, a very large 
reactive power loss of 89Mvar, which is nearly 28% of the 
loading demand, has been observed due to the adoption of 
a 22% high impedance generator step-up transformers. 
3.2 Short Circuit Analysis 
The generators and large motors in the cogeneration 
plant as well as external Taipower system will contribute a 
significant short circuit current when system fault occurs.  
The interrupting current of circuit breaker at 161-kV level 
is limited to 50-kA. However, it does not allow more than 
40-kA for circuit breaker at 33-kV level due to limited 
space and other consideration. Up to now, the maximum 
short circuit capacity at Taipower 161-kV substation (bus 
B1) is 9132MVA. Therefore, the step-up transformers for 
cogeneration units are designed with a high impedance of 
22% to reduce the fault current to meet the requirement of 
short circuit capacity in the plant. Table II lists the fault 
currents at main buses of the study system with a three-
phase bolted ground fault. It is found that the critical site in 
the cogeneration plant is at power house mill (bus B11) 
because its fault current has reached to 39.523-kA. Fig. 3 
shows the fault current at many main buses by considering 
various impedance values of transformers. Although bus 
B11 is still the critical site,  the fault current has only been 
increased a little and reach 39.579-kA if the impedance of 
transformers is selected as 8%. On the contrary, the 
reactive power loss can be reduced from 89Mvar to 
76Mvar.

4.1.2 HSRM Operation With Compensations 
According to the previous simulation results, very 
serious voltage fluctuations and poor power factors have 
been observed when the hot strip rolling starts to operate. 
It is necessary to install compensation equipment to meet 
the operation criterion by maintaining the voltage variation 
within 5% and the power factor above 0.95. In this study, 
two capacitor banks with a rating capacity of 8Mvar each 
are installed at the 11.5-kV buses B39 and B40 to improve 
the power factor of the HSRM. Furthermore, the fast 
adjusting reactive power equipments such as SVC and 
STATCOM [9-10] are also considered for the mitigation 
of serious voltage fluctuation phenomenon. Table IV gives 
the simulation results by applying the reactive power 
compensations. Before the start of rolling process, the 
voltage at bus B16 is risen to 0.996pu and the power factor 
at the HSRM incoming tie line is also improved to be 
0.996 due to the reactive power compensation by fixed 
capacitor banks. A controllable and quick compensating 
reactive power equipment is then installed at HSRM. The 
lowest voltage has been improved to be 0.946pu with R2 
rolling pass after the reactive power compensation by SVC 
with capacity of 63Mvar. It is also found that the voltage 
deviation can be maintained within 5% and power factor 
can keep above 0.95 if proper capacitor banks and SVC are 
installed.

4.2 Starting of Large Induction Motors 
Typically, an induction motor may draw 6 to 10 times 
of its full load current during start-up [1]. The resulting 
voltage sag due to the starting current of large induction 
motors has to be analyzed. Although the full-voltage 
starting provides low cost and allows the fast acceleration, 
the other motor stating methods such as autotransformer 
starter, wye-delta starter etc. are often applied to assist the 
motor starting successfully without causing too serious 
voltage sag. In this paper, a large induction motor with a 
rating capacity of 6.08MVA at bus B35 is selected for the 
motor starting analysis. Fig. 6 shows the equivalent circuit 
of the induction motor with parameters in Table V. Figs. 7 
and 8 show the motor speeds and voltage profiles during 
the motor starting process by considering the direct full-
voltage and wye-delta starter methods. It takes about 30 s 
for acceleration to reach the rated speed with the terminal 
voltage being dropped to the minimum value of 10.1-kV 
(0.878pu) if the motor is started with full voltage. The 
maximum voltage deviation reached the value of 9.98%, 
which will violate the operation constraint of power 
system. To prevent the voltage from dropping below 0.9pu, 
the wye-delta starter method is applied to reduce the 
starting voltage to 57% of the full voltage. It is found that 
the minimum voltage has been boosted to 10.84-kV 
(0.943pu) while the starting time has been extended to 
about 80 s. 
The maximum voltage deviation resulting from the 
starting of motor can also be obtained by applying the 
maximum reactive power fluctuation method. At the 
moment of motor starting, the equivalent resistance (Rth) 
and reactance (Xth) in Fig. 6 can be calculated as 0.181Ω 
and 2.211Ω respectively by setting the value of slip(s) as 1.  
Thus, the starting current (Ims) and power factor (pfms) of 
the motor can be derived from (3) and (4), respectively.

After that, the harmonic power analysis is then 
executed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed 
filters design for the mitigation of harmonic distortion. It is 
found that the total harmonic voltage distortion (THDV) 
and the total harmonic current demand distortion (TDDI) at 
the PCC are calculated as 1.68% and 1.62%, respectively 
with the installation of capacitor banks in the extension 
plant only. However, the THDV and TDDI can be 
significantly reduced to 0.45% and 0.43%, respectively if 
the pass filters are installed. Table VIII gives the major 
harmonic current and voltage magnitudes. It is found that 
each orders of harmonic current and voltage are also within 
limits of the Taipower.

VI. ISOCHRONOUS OPERATION ANALYSIS 
This section discusses how to perform the isochronous 
operation of the cogeneration system by executing the 
transient stability analysis [14]. To execute the transient 
stability analysis of the steel cogeneration facility, all the 
cogeneration units with the corresponding excitation 
systems and governor systems are represented by the 
mathematical models for the simulation of system 
responses such as voltage, frequency, etc. First, the 
transient and sub-transient impedances of the cogeneration 
units are considered in the computer simulation to achieve 
more accurate results. The damping coils at both d-axis and 
q-axis are also included. In addition, the IEEE AC1 type 
excitation model [15] is used for all the cogeneration units 
to regulate their terminal voltages. Furthermore, a 
simplified governor model [16] is used to represent the 
mechanical output power for the dynamic behavior of the 
cogeneration turbines as shown in Fig. 10. A constant 
power control mode is applied for the governor system 
when the cogeneration system is tied with the Taipower 
system. By this control mode, the power output of the 
cogeneration units is adjusted by the speed regulator only 
to regulate the input power of steam turbines based on the 
economic dispatch strategy. When an external fault occur, 
the tie lines have to be tripped and the steel plant becomes 
an islanding system to maintain the stable operation of the 
cogeneration system. In this operation scenario, the 
governor control will be switched to the constant-frequency 
mode by adjusting the generation output according to the 
speed deviation after the cogeneration system operated in 
the isolated condition. With the quick response of the 
governor action and proper design of load-shedding 
scheme, the system frequency of the isolated cogeneration 
system can therefore be maintained without causing the 
tripping of cogeneration units. Tables IX to XI give the 
parameters of main cogeneration units, TG1-TG5.

In this study, the initial power flow based on the 
maximum anticipated overload of the cogeneration system 
is solved and selected for the stability analysis. The total 
cogeneration generation is 321MW and the total load 
demand is 533 MW are considered as the operation 
condition for the steel plant. In addition, two scenarios of 
system fault contingencies have been simulated to examine 
the transient behavior of the cogeneration power system 
after the tripping of two 161-kV tie lines.

VII. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents the electric power system analysis 
and design for an expanding steel plant with cogeneration 
units by performing the analysis of power flow, short 
circuit, voltage fluctuation, harmonic flow and transient 
stability. It is found that all equipments can be operated 
successfully within their rating capabilities based on the designed 
configuration and selected parameters under various operation 
scenarios. However, the cogeneration system will be operated in 
a more effective and flexible manner if the impedance of 
generator step-up transformers can be reduced from 22% to 8%. 
Also, the voltage fluctuation resulted from the operation of hot 
strip rolling can be maintained within 5% and power factor can 
keep above 0.95 if proper capacitor banks and SVC are installed. 
By the way, the voltage sag due to the starting of induction 
motor can be improved from 0.88pu to 0.94pu by adopting the 
wye-delta starter method. Furthermore, the harmonic 
distortion, THDV and the TDDI, at PCC can be reduced to 
0.45% and 0.43%, respectively by the implementation of 
the proposed passive filters. For the severe external fault in 
Taipower system, the cogeneration units can maintain the 
stable operation in isochronous mode by applying the 
governor control action and executing the load shedding 
scheme after the tie line tripping. It is concluded that the 
power quality and operation performance of the steel plant 
can be effectively enhanced by performing various power 
system analyses for the design of system configuration, 
equipments and operation strategy.

an H-beam plant served by transformer TR8 with a 22.8-kV
voltage level. In addition, several equipment like blast furnaces,
basic oxide furnaces, and hot strip rolling will be installed for
the expansion of the steel plant. It is therefore necessary to con-
struct six new 33-kV buses (B11–B16) to serve the new loads
in the plant. The 33-kV buses will be connected to the incoming
161-kV bus B2 via step-down transformers TR1–TR6. By the
way, many 11.5-kV buses are also built to receive the electric
power through transformers T31–T50. To make use of the waste
gas which is the by-product of the iron making and to enhance
TABLE I
PARAMETERS OF THE MAIN TRANSFORMERS
the reliability of power system, five steam turbines (TG1–TG5),
two top-pressure recovery turbines (TRT1–TRT2), and two
coke dry quenching (CDQ1–CDQ2)-type turbines are consid-
ered to drive the cogeneration units. The total rated generation
capacity of all cogeneration units will reach 529 MW in the
integrated steel plant. Table I lists the parameters of the main
transformers in the cogeneration plant.
III. POWER FLOW AND SHORT-CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
To ensure that the power system of the integrated steel plant
can be operated in a more effective manner under various
normal operation scenarios, power flow analysis is applied to
determine the parameters and setting values of the equipment.
The short-circuit analysis is also used for the calculation of
fault current to ensure the safety of bus bars and the sufficient
capacity of circuit breakers.
A. Power Flow Analysis
In this section, the operation scenario with a total generation
of 321 MW and a total loading demand of 533 MW is selected
for computer simulation. The terminal voltage of the cogener-
ation units is adjusted to be 1.01 p.u. while the tap position of
generator step-up transformers is set as 101.25%. Furthermore,
many capacitor banks with a total capacity of 196 Mvar are
installed at different sites for reactive power compensation. It
is found that all the bus voltages can be maintained within
0.970–1.012 p.u., and the cogeneration plant has to import
electric power of 216 MW from Taipower with a 0.964 lagging
power factor at point of common coupling (PCC) to meet the
total load demand in the plant. All equipment can be operated
within their rating capabilities. However, a very large reactive
power loss of 89 Mvar, which is nearly 28% of the loading
demand, has been observed due to the adoption of 22% high-
impedance generator step-up transformers.
B. Short-Circuit Analysis
The generators and large motors in the cogeneration plant as
well as external Taipower system will contribute a significant
short-circuit current when system fault occurs. The interrupting
current of circuit breaker at 161-kV level is limited to 50 kA.
However, it does not allow more than 40 kA for circuit breaker
at 33-kV level due to limited space and other consideration.
Up to now, the maximum short-circuit capacity at Taipower
161-kV substation (bus B1) is 9132 MVA. Therefore, the step-
up transformers for cogeneration units are designed with a
1530 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 47, NO. 4, JULY/AUGUST 2011
TABLE III

dramatically at each rolling pass to result in the severe voltage
fluctuation. It is observed that the minimum voltage is dropped
to 0.876 p.u. when the reactive power consumption of HSRM
reaches the maximum value of 117.48 Mvar at R2 rolling pass.
At the same time, the largest voltage deviation of 10.7% and the
worst power factor of 0.766 are also found.
In this paper, the maximum voltage deviation is also
calculated by applying the maximum reactive power fluctuation
method. For the same working condition, the maximum reactive
power variation (ΔQmax) due to the operation of synchronous
motors is 0.98 p.u. if the system base is chosen as 100 MVA.
Thus, the short-circuit reactance can be further cal-
culated as
Xsc =
MV Abase
MV Asc
=
100
1048.8
= 0.095 p.u. (2)
where MV Asc is the three-phase short-circuit capacity of
1048.8 MVA at bus B16. The ΔVmax can be calculated as
9.3% by applying (1). The mismatch of the maximum voltage
deviation between the two methods is only 1.4%. It is there-
fore acceptable to calculate the voltage deviation by using the
maximum reactive power fluctuation method.
2) HSRM Operation With Compensations: According to the
previous simulation results, very serious voltage fluctuations
and poor power factors have been observed when the hot strip
rolling starts to operate. It is necessary to install a compensation
equipment to meet the operation criterion by maintaining the
voltage variation within 5% and the power factor above 0.95. In
this paper, two capacitor banks with a rating capacity of 8 Mvar
each are installed at the 11.5-kV buses B39 and B40 to improve
the power factor of the HSRM. Furthermore, the fast adjusting
reactive power equipment such as SVC and static synchronous
compensator [9], [10] is also considered for the mitigation of
serious voltage fluctuation phenomenon. Table IV gives the
simulation results by applying the reactive power compensa-
tions. Before the start of the rolling process, the voltage at bus
B16 is raised to 0.996 p.u. and the power factor at the HSRM
incoming tie line is also improved to be 0.996 due to the reactive
power compensation by fixed capacitor banks. Controllable

and quick compensating reactive power equipment is then
installed at HSRM. The lowest voltage has been improved to be
0.946 p.u. with R2 rolling pass after the reactive power com-
pensation by SVC with a capacity of 63 Mvar. It is also found
that the voltage deviation can be maintained within 5% and the
power factor can be kept above 0.95 if proper capacitor banks
and SVC are installed.
B. Starting of Large Induction Motors
Typically, an induction motor may draw six to ten times of its
full load current during start-up [1]. The resulting voltage sag
due to the starting current of large induction motors has to be
analyzed. Although the full-voltage starting provides low cost
and allows fast acceleration, the other motor starting methods,
such as autotransformer starter, wye–delta starter, etc., are often
applied to assist the motor starting successfully without causing
too serious voltage sag. In this paper, a large induction motor
with a rating capacity of 6.08 MVA at bus B35 is selected
for the motor starting analysis. Fig. 6 shows the equivalent
circuit of the induction motor with parameters in Table V.
Figs. 7 and 8 show the motor speeds and voltage profiles
during the motor starting process by considering the direct full-
voltage and wye–delta starter methods. It takes about 30 s for
acceleration to reach the rated speed with the terminal voltage
being dropped to the minimum value of 10.1 kV (0.878 p.u.)
if the motor is started with full voltage. The maximum voltage
deviation reached the value of 9.98%, which will violate the
operation constraint of power system. To prevent the voltage
from dropping below 0.9 p.u., the wye–delta starter method is

where V1 is the fundamental frequency voltage and IL is the
total rating currents of the main transformers at 161-kV bus,
which has been calculated as 3414 A. In this paper, many shunt
passive filters are designed and installed at various buses to
reduce the harmonic distortion. Tables VI and VII show the
parameters of existing and new design filters. Several bandpass
(BP) filters and two high-pass (HP) filters have been installed
in the existing power system. To prevent the deterioration of
power quality by many equipment in the extension plant, the
new BP and HP filters are therefore designed and installed at
buses HBP, B16, B33, B35, B37, and B39.
After that, the harmonic power analysis is then executed
to examine the effectiveness of the proposed filter design for
the mitigation of harmonic distortion. It is found that the total

harmonic voltage distortion (THDV ) and the total harmonic
current demand distortion (TDDI) at the PCC are calculated
as 1.68% and 1.62%, respectively, with the installation of ca-
pacitor banks in the extension plant only. However, the THDV
and TDDI can be significantly reduced to 0.45% and 0.43%,
respectively, if the pass filters are installed. Table VIII gives the
major harmonic current and voltage magnitudes. It is found that
each order of harmonic current and voltage is also within limits
of the Taipower.
VI. AUTONOMOUS OPERATION ANALYSIS
This section discusses how to perform the autonomous op-
eration of the cogeneration system by executing the transient
stability analysis [14]. To execute the transient stability analysis
of the steel cogeneration facility, all the cogeneration units with
the corresponding excitation systems and governor systems are
represented by the mathematical models for the simulation of
system responses such as voltage, frequency, etc. First, the
transient and subtransient impedances of the cogeneration units
are considered in the computer simulation to achieve more
accurate results. The damping coils at both d-axis and q-axis
are also included. In addition, the IEEE AC1-type excitation
model [15] is used for all the cogeneration units to regulate their
terminal voltages. Furthermore, a simplified governor model
[16] is used to represent the mechanical output power for the
dynamic behavior of the cogeneration turbines as shown in
Fig. 10. A constant power control mode is applied for the
governor system when the cogeneration system is tied with
the Taipower system. By this control mode, the power output
of the cogeneration units is adjusted by the speed regulator
only to regulate the input power of steam turbines based on
the economic dispatch strategy. When an external fault occurs,
the tie lines have to be tripped and the steel plant becomes
an islanding system to maintain the stable operation of the
cogeneration system. In this operation scenario, the governor

bance case.
it is cleared by the protection scheme with a time delay of
0.1 s. The cogeneration becomes an isolated power system after
the protection scheme to trip the tie lines. Figs. 13 and 14 show
the response of voltage magnitude and frequency at 161-kV
bus of the cogeneration system, while the mechanical output
power of the generator turbines is solved as shown in Fig. 15.
It is found that the voltage magnitude has dropped to be near
zero during the fault period and is restored to the nominal value
quickly after the fault cleared. The system frequency reached
the maximum value of 60.4 Hz during the fault period and then
declined quickly to a minimum value of 59.76 Hz after the tie
line tripping. A load shedding of 221 MW is executed at the
same time as the tie line tripping because the total load demand
is much larger than the total generation of cogeneration units.
With the quick regulation of governor system, the mechanical
output power of TG1 and TG2 generator turbines has ever
decreased to the minimum value of 55 MW and then increased
to the maximum value of 65 MW before reaching the stable
value of 61 MW.
To maintain the stable operation of the steel plant, it is
absolutely necessary to disconnect the cogeneration system
from the utility as soon as possible to prevent the total system
blackout when the external faults occurred. It is concluded
that the cogeneration system can be operated successfully with
autonomous mode after examining the dynamic response of the
system voltage, frequency, and power output of the cogenera-
tion units.

bines for nearby disturbance case.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented the electric power system analysis
and design for an expanding steel plant with cogeneration units
by performing the analysis of power flow, short circuit, voltage
fluctuation, harmonic flow, and transient stability. It is found
that all equipment can be operated successfully within their
rating capabilities based on the designed configuration and se-
lected parameters under various operation scenarios. However,
the cogeneration system will be operated in a more effective
and flexible manner if the impedance of generator step-up
transformers can be reduced from 22% to 8%. Also, the voltage
fluctuation resulted from the operation of hot strip rolling can
be maintained within 5%, and the power factor can be kept
above 0.95 if proper capacitor banks and SVC are installed.
By the way, the voltage sag due to the starting of induction
motor can be improved from 0.88 to 0.94 p.u. by adopting the
wye–delta starter method. Furthermore, the harmonic distortion
THDV and the TDDI at PCC can be reduced to 0.45% and
0.43%, respectively, by the implementation of the proposed
passive filters. For the severe external fault in Taipower system,
the cogeneration units can maintain the stable operation in
autonomous mode by applying the governor control action and
executing the load-shedding scheme after the tie line tripping. It
is concluded that the power quality and operation performance
of the steel plant can be effectively enhanced by performing
various power system analyses for the design of system config-
uration, equipment, and operation strategy.
