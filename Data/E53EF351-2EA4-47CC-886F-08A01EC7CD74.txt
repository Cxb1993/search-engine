英文摘要： RNA interference (RNAi) is commonly applied in genome-scale 
gene functional screens. However, a one-on-one RNAi analysis that 
targets each gene is cost-ineffective and laborious. Previous studies 
indicated that siRNAs can also affect RNAs that are near-perfectly 
complementary, and this phenomenon has been termed an off-
targets effect. This phenomenon implies that it is possible to silence 
several genes simultaneously with a carefully designed siRNA. We 
propose a strategy that was combined with a heuristic algorithm to 
design suitable siRNAs and a group testing idea that would 
minimize the number of required RNAi experiments in a large-scale 
RNAi analysis was proposed. To verify the efficiency of our 
strategy, we used the data from Orchid expressed sequence tags as a 
test study to screen the putative transcription factors that are 
involved in plant disease responses. We identified 94 qualified 
siRNAs that were required to examine all of the predicated 229 
transcription factors. In addition, among the 94 computer-designed 
siRNAs, an siRNA that targets both TF15 (a previously identified 
transcription factor that is involved in the plant disease-response 
pathway) and TF21 was introduced into orchids. The use of this 
siRNA revealed that an siRNA can simultaneously silence TF15 and 
TF21. Interestingly, our second-round analysis that used an siRNA 
specific to TF21 indicated that TF21 is a previously unidentified 
transcription factor that is involved in plant defense responses. 
 
  
中文摘要 
在執行本計畫的第三年中，我們利用計畫前兩年所得的研究成果與經驗，發展了兩個新
的方法。這兩個方法分別可應用在基因功能篩選與病毒演化的研究上，並且在實際應用上我們
也證實了其實用性與可行性。底下為此兩個研究成果的中文摘要。 
 
Part I: 
RNA干擾(RNA interference, RNAi)普遍被應用在基因體規模的基因功能篩選。然而，
傳統的一對一的RNAi分析(針對一個目標基因即設計一個 siRNA進行RNAi實驗)需要消
耗大量的勞力與經費。已有研究顯示出 siRNA對於近似完美互補(near-perfectly 
complementary)的基因也會有抑制效果，並且在本計畫的第一年裏，我們已成功的初步建
立了一資料比對系統。在給定兩個基因體(Genome)，以及長度 l、距離 d，這兩個參數的
情況下，利用將資料分類的方式，來加速後來此兩基因體中子片段的比對，進而得出所
有長度為 l且兩兩之間的漢明距離(Hamming Distance)皆小於 d的短片段序列。 
為了降低 RNAi分析的成本，我們利用在本計畫的第一年裏建立的資料比對系統並
結合群試(Group testing)的概念，設計出了一個可以在大規模的 RNAi分析實驗中幫助降
低所需 RNAi實驗次數的方法。並且利用蘭花(Orchid)的表現序列標幟(Expressed sequence 
tags, ESTs)來對我們的方法進行驗證。 
 
 
Part II: 
基因重組(Recombination)不僅會導致病毒基因體有基因重排(Rearrangement)的現象
也在演化上扮演了一個相當重要的角色。由於病毒的基因體發生基因重組的機率與速度
相當高，因此可能產生基因體(Genome)極為不相似的後代(Offspring)，雖然這些後代的基
因體中仍有共同的保留區(Conserved region)，但是由於多次的基因重組，這些保留區可能
被分割成許多小片段並且被重排成不同的順序與方向。因此偵測病毒的基因重組事件是
相當困難的，並且利用現行的比對方式或基因重組方式很難追朔病毒的演化歷史。  
為了解決這樣的問題，我們利用最大期望演算法(Expectation maximization algorithm)
來辨識病毒基因體中共有的基序(Motif)，並且利用這些基序來評估病毒間的基因重排關
係。並且，我們的方法也會利用到部分基因體間共有的基序，以期獲得更多的演化資訊。
我們把我們的方法應用到香蕉萎縮病毒(Banana bunchy top virus, BBTV)的演化分析上。原
本被認為是各自不同的六條 BBTV基因體，透過我們的方法分析後，發現事實上它們是
經由頻繁的基因重組而演化出來的結果，並且 DNA-S跟 DNA-M具有高度的相關性。 
 
 
  
  
INTRODUCTION 
The study of plant genomes has increased dramatically over the last decade [1-2]. Many 
genome sequencing projects for important crops, such as maize [3], wheat [4-5] and rice [6-7] were 
recently completed. The available plant genomic sequence data will continue to increase explosively 
due to the recently developed next-generation sequencing techniques [8-10]. Therefore, a major 
challenge to all biologists is how to efficiently translate the functions of these genetic codes.  
One of the most efficient tools in high-throughput gene functional analysis is the application of 
RNA interference (RNAi) [11-12]. RNAi can be induced by introducing a small double-stranded (ds) 
RNA into a cell [13]. The dsRNA will be processed into a small interference RNA (siRNA), and it 
will be incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Next, the siRNA that is 
incorporated in the RISC will guide the RISC to recognize a target mRNA sequence that is 
complimentary to the guiding siRNA; this recognition further inhibits the expression of the target 
mRNA. 
RNAi has been widely employed in genome-wide scale studies of model organisms, including 
animals and plants [14-20]. The primary goals of these applications are usually related to the 
screening of a single gene or multiple genes that convey(s) a particular phenotype. In these 
applications, each dsRNA is designed to target one specific gene and to facilitate the observation of 
the resulting phenotype change. This one-on-one approach works very well for gene functional 
analyses, but genome-wide screens require extensive labor and costs. In reality, RNAi screening is 
often used to screen particular groups of genes through strategies such as literature surveys or 
transcriptome analyses [21-22]. However, these approaches usually identify hundreds to thousands of 
candidate genes, and the subsequent large-scale RNAi analysis is a challenge for most laboratories. 
siRNAs do not need to perfectly complement their targets. Genes that contain a sequence that 
is partially similar to the designed siRNA may also be down-regulated (off-target effect) [23]. The 
off-target effects have been widely discussed and studied in both animals and plants [24-26], and 
they are widely considered a general problem for analyses; however, off-target effects also facilitate 
the silencing of multiple genes simultaneously with a carefully designed siRNA. 
Here, we utilize the off-target effects to develop a hierarchical RNAi screening strategy to 
reduce the cost and labor of high-throughput RNAi analyses. Our strategy utilizes a heuristic 
algorithm to design siRNAs and uses grouping testing methods to minimize the RNAi analysis for 
identifying genes that are involved in a particular phenotype. Our strategy can be applied to 
whole-genome RNAi analyses to reduce the number of initial experiments that are needed for 
phenotype screening, and it is particularly suitable for a group of candidate genes that were first 
identified by an experimental approach. We have verified the applicability of this method by 
analyzing transcription factors that are known to be involved in plant defense responses in orchids, 
and we also identified a new transcription factor that is involved in this process.  
  
  
 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of each step of our heuristic method. (A) The process of enumerating 
the subsequences from the candidate genes. The green sequence represents a candidate gene, and the 
blue sequences represent the subsequences that were derived from this candidate gene by the sliding 
scan. (B) Diagram of the relationship between the subsequences. The blue lines C1, C2,…, C8 represent 
the candidate genes, and S1, S2,…, S11 are the subsequences that were enumerated from these candidate 
genes. The solid line between two subsequences indicates that these two subsequences are neighbors, 
whereas the dotted line indicates that two subsequences are far_neighbors. Each subsequence is marked 
as a candidate for a qualified sequence. (C) Diagram of the relationship between the marked 
subsequences after the far_neighbor examination. The subsequences S5, S9 and S10 are unmarked 
because they all contained a far_neighbor. However, S2 is still marked because one of its neighbors 
was located in C4, and its far_neighbor S5 was also located in C4. In this situation, it is not a concern 
  
unless the far_neighbors of a subsequence were derived from the genes from which its neighbors 
were derived (Figure 1c).  
To reduce the computing time that was required to perform the next steps, we attempted to 
remove the less useful subsequences. To achieve this, we first looked for a “powerful subsequence”. 
Any subsequence P that satisfied equation (1) was defined as a powerful subsequence, and the 
powerful subsequence dominated its neighbors. Because the powerful subsequence can target all of 
its neighbors’ target genes, the removal of these subsequences (their target genes can be covered by 
the powerful subsequence) will save computational resources without causing any side effects. 
 ⋃ 𝑁𝑁(𝑣𝑣) ⊆ {𝑁𝑁(𝑃𝑃) ∪ 𝑃𝑃}𝑣𝑣∈𝑁𝑁(𝑃𝑃)     (1) 
Figure 2 shows an example of a powerful subsequence and the subsequences that would be 
unmarked. To identify the powerful subsequences, we examined each subsequence to determine 
whether it satisfied equation (1). After identifying the powerful subsequences, we continued to 
unmark the subsequences that were dominated and were not powerful subsequences (Figure 1d). 
These unmarked subsequences were ignored in our later analysis.  
 
 
Figure 2. A simple example of a powerful subsequence P. X, Y and P are subsequences, and the edges 
indicate the neighborhood relationship of these variables. According to this figure, X and Y are the 
neighbors of P, but X and Y are not close to each other. In the case, the reverse complement sequence of 
P has the potential to silence all three of the genes (X, Y and P), but the reverse complement sequence of 
X or Y can only silence two of the genes. Because P can cover all of its neighbors’ target genes, P is 
more powerful than X and Y. In this case, we say P is a powerful subsequence, and X and Y are 
dominated by P. 
 
Excluded-gene hit examination 
To prevent the targeting of excluded-genes, we continued to examine whether each marked 
subsequence displayed a Hamming distance at least a dN to every excluded-gene. For any 
subsequence t, if there existed a subsequence u of an excluded-gene such that HD(t,u) < dN, HD(t,u) 
represented the Hamming distance between t and u, then t is determined to contain an excluded-gene 
hit and this subsequence t would be abandoned. To perform this work, we enumerated all of the 
  
dsDNA construct was sequenced to confirm the sequence of the cloned fragments. The LR Clonase 
II enzyme (Invitrogen) was used to transfer the cloned fragments into pB7GWIWG2 [29] to generate 
pB7GWIWG2-PhaTF15-hpRNA. 
 
Transient gene silencing assay 
pCambia-CymMV-Gateway, pB7GWIWG2 and their derivatives were transformed into 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 by electroporation. The A. tumefaciens strains were cultured 
in 2 ml of YEB of medium containing 100 mg/l kanamycin and 100 μM acetosyringone overnight at 
28℃ . One milliliter of the bacterial culture was then transferred into 10 ml of YEB medium 
containing 100 mg/l kanamycin and 100 μM acetosyringone and was further incubated at 28℃ until 
the OD reached approximately 1.0–1.2. The A. tumefaciens cultures were then centrifuged at 3000 
×g for 10 min; the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of infiltration medium (10 mM MES, 10 mM 
MgCl2, 100 mM acetosyringone) and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Each Phalaenopsis 
plant was then infiltrated with 100 μl of the A. tumefaciens suspension. The plant RNA was extracted 
and analyzed 4 days after the agroinfiltration. 
 
RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis  
To conduct the semiquantitative RT-PCR experiment, the total RNA was extracted from the 
orchid plant as previously described [30]. One microgram of RNA was treated with RNase-free 
DNase (Ambion, 1 unit) for 0.5 h to eliminate any genomic DNA contamination. Next, 0.5 μg of 
DNA-free RNA for each sample was used for the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA using 
Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase following the manufacturer's 
instructions (Invitrogen). The PCR amplification was performed using gene-specific oligonucleotide 
primers according to a previously described method [31]. The PCR products were separated by 
electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Ubiquitin 10 was used as an internal 
control. 
  
  
heuristic algorithm was incorporated into the workflow that was used to design the siRNAs that were 
needed in the first-round analysis of our strategy. The flowchart is depicted in Figure 3.  
Because previous experiments indicated that 21 nucleotides were sufficient to trigger RNAi in 
plants, we set the length (L) of the qualified siRNA as 21 [35]. Previous reports also indicated that 
siRNAs can target genes with four mismatches [24, 36]. Therefore, we first tolerated the presence of 
four mismatches (dT) between an siRNA and its target gene. To avoid the target of unanticipated 
genes by the siRNA, each siRNA was designed to contain at least five mismatches (dN) with every 
gene excluding its own target genes. Therefore, in this case study, we selected the parameters dT = 4, 
dN = 5 and L = 21 for our heuristic algorithm to design the qualified siRNAs.  
In the first stage of our heuristic algorithm, we enumerated 191,087 subsequences of length 21 
from these 229 TF sequences and then computed the pairwise Hamming distances between these 
subsequences (see the subsection “Enumerating subsequences and computing subsequence 
similarity” in the Materials and Methods). According to the similarity relationship of these 
subsequences, we obtained the information regarding the potential target genes of the siRNAs that 
were designed on the basis of these subsequences. Next, to ensure that the designed siRNAs 
contained at least a dN distance to their non-target genes and to remove the less powerful 
subsequences, we performed a far_neighbor and powerful subsequence examination of these 
subsequences, and we unmarked the disqualified subsequences (see the subsection “Far_neighbor 
and powerful subsequence examination” in the Materials and Methods). However, because we 
adapted the parameters dT = 4 and dN = 5 in our orchid transcription factor analysis, no 
far_neighbors were present for the subsequences in our analysis. After this examination, 188,889 
subsequences were still marked. To prevent the designed siRNAs from targeting the excluded-genes, 
we continued to perform the excluded -gene hit examination of the remaining marked subsequences 
in the third stage (see the subsection “Excluded-gene hit examination” in the Materials and 
Methods). In total, 106,723 subsequences passed this examination, and these subsequences were the 
qualified sequences.  
In stage 4, subsequences were selected from the qualified sequences, and they were used as 
templates to design qualified siRNAs. However, some of the qualified siRNAs that were derived 
from these qualified sequences may have targeted the same genes, which would have resulted in 
redundancy; therefore, we performed the redundancy reduction to select the best sequences for this 
use (see the subsection “Redundancy reduction” in the Materials and Methods). After the reduction 
was performed, 2147 non-redundant qualified siRNAs remained. To screen every candidate gene at 
least once, we needed at least k qualified siRNAs, r1 … rk, such that ⋃ 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 = 𝑆𝑆1≤𝑖𝑖≤𝑘𝑘 , where iT  is the 
target gene set of siRNA ri. Moreover, to minimize the cost, we also wanted to minimize the number 
of first-round RNAi experiments. The problem of satisfying ⋃ 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 = 𝑆𝑆1≤𝑖𝑖≤𝑘𝑘  with a minimum of k 
qualified siRNAs is exactly the set cover problem has been proved to be an NP-hard problem [37]. 
Therefore, we adopted the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem to select siRNAs [27-28]. 
Furthermore, to achieve a near-optimal solution and to increase the examination frequency of each 
candidate gene, we slightly modified this greedy algorithm (see the subsection “Modified greedy 
  
Hierarchical RNAi analysis strategy 
Once we had selected the 94 siRNAs, we were able to perform our strategy, hierarchical RNAi 
analysis, which contained two rounds of RNAi analysis. In the first round of RNAi analysis, we 
observed phenotypes and correlated those phenotypes to at least one of the genes that were affected 
in the experiment. To identify the associated gene more precisely, a second round of analysis was 
needed. However, in an RNAi experiment, the selected siRNA and its reverse complement sequence 
(the selected siRNA sense strand) are employed to form a dsRNA that triggers RNAi. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that both of the dsRNA strands can be loaded into the RISC and that both 
strands can facilitate RNAi [38-40]. Therefore, in addition to the target genes of the selected siRNA, 
we also needed to examine the possible target(s) of the complementary strand of the selected siRNA. 
The potential target genes contained a subsequence that had at most dT mismatches (in this case, dT = 
4) with the selected siRNA sense strand. To precisely identify the associated gene from these affected 
genes, we designed dsRNAs that would specifically target all of the possible target genes in the 
second-round analysis (Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of the hierarchical examination 
process). According to our statistical results from each sense strand of the qualified siRNA, the 
average number of potential targets of the sense strand was 0.6511, so only a limited number of 
genes could have been affected in each RNAi experiment in the first-round analysis.

particular phenotype. R = {r1, r2, …, rk} is the set of qualified siRNAs that were selected by our 
modified algorithm. The candidate genes in each ellipse are the target genes of each available siRNA ri. 
In the first-round RNAi analysis, we can determine which candidate genes may be related to the target 
phenotype based on the RNAi experiment results. The green ellipse represents the target phenotype that 
was affected in the RNAi experiment with ri, whereas the blue ellipse indicates that the target phenotype 
was not affected. In the second-round RNAi analysis, we further examined the candidate genes in the 
green ellipses to precisely identify the related genes. However, the complementary strand of the selected

levels of PhaPR1, PhaNPR1, PhaTF15 and PhaTF60 were analyzed in healthy (H) plants, plants that 
were infiltrated with Agrobacterium that carried an empty pB7GWIW2 vector (agro), or Agrobacterium 
that carried pB7GWIW2 to deliver different hairpin RNAs that were designed from siRNA G55 
(hpRNA-G55) or were specific to PhaTF60 (PhaTF60-hpRNA). The Agrobacterium strain that carried a 
partial PhaTF15 cDNA was used as a positive control (P), and PhaTF60 was used as a negative control. 
The plants that were pretreated with SA to induce the SA-related plant defense response are indicated. 
Phalaenopsis Ubiquitin 10 was used as an internal control.  
 
  
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we developed a strategy to minimize the efforts required to perform 
high-throughput RNAi screening to identify genes involved in a particular phenotype. Our strategies 
took advantage of the biological phenomenon of the off-target effect of RNAi and utilized the set 
cover algorithm and the group testing method. We verified our strategy in a set of previously 
screened transcription factors involved in plant defense responses, and we found that the strategy 
could eliminate at least half of the experiments that would be required for the traditional one-on-one 
RNAi screening. In addition, our strategy allowed us to identify a new transcription factor, TF21, 
which is involved in plant defense responses. This result indicated the applicability of our strategy to 
high-throughput RNAi analyses. 
Our strategy also provides an alternative method to identify of genes involved in a particular 
phenotype to the traditional one-on-one RNAi experiments. The analysis of the mutant collection of 
model organisms revealed that single-gene knockouts did not usually exhibit an observable 
phenotype [42-44]. Our strategy facilitates the more efficient screening of single genes that are 
involved in a phenotype and the simultaneous targeting of several genes; this simultaneous targeting 
provides an opportunity to observe additional phenotypes that can only be observed when multiple 
genes are silenced.

Motif-based Phylogenetic Analysis Reveals Frequent 
Recombination between Genome Components of the 
Multipartite Virus - Banana bunchy top virus 
 
ABSTRACT 
Recombination causes rearrangement in viral genomes and plays an important role in evolution. 
In viruses, recombination events may accumulate rapidly and lead to mosaic offspring sequences in 
which the conserved region may be separated into smaller segments and rearranged in a different 
order and direction. Thus, the recombination events are difficult to detect, and their evolutionary 
history cannot be easily deduced using current alignment- and rearrangement-based methods. To 
address this problem, we use an expectation maximization algorithm to detect possible 
recombination events by identifying recurring motifs in the genome and performing statistical 
simulations to select high-confidence motifs. We then rearrange these motifs and concatenate them 
into analogous sequences that can be examined in alignment-based phylogenetic analysis. The motifs 
can also be used as genome markers to estimate their rearrangement relationships. Moreover, our 
methods allow us to index motifs that are shared specifically by certain members of sequences, 
which provide additional evolutionary information. We applied our method to the multipartite DNA 
virus Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) to establish the evolutionary relationships between its 6 
genome components (DNA –R, -U3, -S, -M, -C, and -N). The 6 BBTV genomes have been 
considered to be distinct components and only share short stretches of conserved sequences that are 
not phylogenetically informative; however, our analysis suggested frequent recombination contribute 
to the evolution of genome components of BBTV and revealed that DNA-S and DNA-M are highly 
related. 
 
  
  
information existed between these distinct genome segments remains to be resolved by suitable 
approaches.  
Our approaches allow us to identify several sets of high-confidence common motifs scattered 
over the 6 genome components of BBTV. These motifs not only increase by 2.5-fold the number of 
sequences that can be used in traditional phylogenetic analysis based on genome alignment but also 
provide “markers” for rearrangement analysis. Our analysis revealed that among the 6 BBTV 
genome segments, DNA-S and DNA-M are highly related. We believe that similar approaches can 
also be applied to resolve the evolution history of viruses. 
  
Motif detection 
The EM-based algorithm Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME), which was introduced by 
Bailey and Elkan [21-22], was used for the detection of sequence motifs. The genome sequences of 
each of the BBTV isolates (Taiwan and Australian) were submitted to MEME 
(http://meme.nbcr.net/meme4_3_0/cgi-bin/meme.cgi) for the determination of similar segments 
(motifs). The variables used in MEME are listed in Table 2. In total, 25 motif sets were retrieved 
from the BBTV genomes. Every set contains six motifs that appear on each component. Pairwise 
motif correlations were checked by MAST [23-24] to exclude similar motif pairs (correlation > 0.60) 
and to identify the corresponding positions of each motif on the BBTV sequences.

Measurement of similarity  
The measure of similarity for each motif set was defined as the mean pairwise distance (MPD) 
or Dh to further verify the confidence of each motif set detected by MEME. For every set of motifs, 
we calculated the Hamming distance [25], h, between each pair of motifs in the set as the first step. 
Then, the distance h between each motif pair was summed and divided by the total number of pairs 
(n motifs give 𝐶𝐶2𝑛𝑛  = n(n-1)/2 possible pairs) to calculate the MPD score. The score Dh of the motif 
set M can be written as: 
( ) ( )∑
=

,
 
where n is the number of motifs in motif set m. The MPD score for each motif set act as a normalized 
value for variation, in which low MPD scores correspond to high conservation between motifs. The 
observed Dh values theoretically reflect the compactness of the motif set m. For instance, conserved 
regions of multipartite genomes will contribute to compact motif sets with lower MPD scores and 
  
RESULTS 
The possible outcome of genomic recombination in viruses with frequent recombination 
Frequent recombination in viruses may cause mosaic offspring sequences which cannot be 
aligned well. The possible situations are depicted in Figure 1A -1C. In the first situation (Fig. 1A), 
conserved sequences (represented by dark blocks) remain in offspring genomes and are scattered 
around the genome. With the accumulation of recombination events, these conserved blocks on the 
offspring genomes may be further rearranged with increased sequence divergence (Fig. 1B). In the 
above cases, the continuity of conserved sequences is altered, and only short fragments with 
positional sequence similarity are easily identified for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, in the 
third situation (Fig. 1C), most regions are considered incomparable, whereas some unique motifs 
within these regions are shared by particular sequences. Although these segments in Fig. 1A, 1B and 
1C may provide evolutionary information, they are often erased by current alignment-based analysis.

organisms with frequent recombination (A) Conserved sequences (represented by dark rectangles) in 
offspring genomes were separated by foreign segments (represented by empty blocks) resulting from 
multi-insertion events. (B) Recombination and inversion may occur in the offspring genomes and lead 
to position and direction rearrangement of the conserved region (represented by dark arrows; the arrow 
head indicates the direction). (C) Progeny genomes may share similar genome organization, whereas 
some unique segments (represented by gray rectangles) within these regions are shared by certain 
progeny.

sequences (DQ826390 DQ826392 DQ826393 DQ826394 DQ826395 DQ826396) that were used for 
analysis were obtained from GenBank. 
 
  
  
 
 
Figure 3. (A) The distribution of 25 common sets of motifs on the genome of 6 integral components of 
Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), detected by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) [26]. 
Genome sequences of BBTV are represented by gray lines. Rectangles marked on the genomes 
represent the identified motifs. The motifs belonging to the same set are indicated in the same color. (B) 
The evaluation of motifs by information content (IC) is repented on the y-axis. The x-axis represents the 
rank of the motif among all motifs identified. The red line represents motif sets detected in the BBTV 
whole genome sequences, and the blue line represents motif sets detected by simulation of a random set 
of sequences. Each set of random sequences contains 6 sequences, and each sequence represents a 
BBTV genome (the lengths and GC contents are identical to those of a corresponding BBTV genome). 
The yellow line represents the IC values derived from 6 identical sequences, and the length and GC 
contents are the average values for the BBTV 6 integral genome. In total, 100,000 sets of sequences 
were used in the simulation. 
  
  
 
Figure 5. The percentage of motifs detected by MEME from motifs that were artificially inserted 
in sets of randomly generated sequences. The mean pairwise distance (Dh) of each MEME detected 
motif set are designated with numbers 1 to 15. For each Dh, 100 sets of sequences were created, where 
each set consisted of 6 sequences and each sequence represented a BBTV genome. For each sequence 
set, 20 artificial motifs were randomly inserted into each sequence. The artificial motifs were generated, 
and the GC contents were calculated as the average value of the motifs detected by MEME from the sets 
of BBTV 6 genome sequences. MEME was used to detect the common motifs of each random sequence 
set. The percentages of the numbers of detected motifs compared with the initially inserted artificial 
motifs (20 motifs) are indicated on the y-axis.  
 
 
Phylogenetic analysis 
From the above analysis, we applied the most stringent criteria (Dh=8) to select the 
high-confidence motifs. In total, 11 high-confidence motifs were selected for further analysis. In the 
first analysis, to minimize the loss of information sites, the conserved motifs within each BBTV 
genome were concatenated into a longer sequence by the incremental order of their motif ranking 
number as presented by Castresana [27-28]. As a consequence, 6 concatenated sequences were 
constructed corresponding to each BBTV sequence, with each sequence containing 11 motifs and 
having a length of 220 bases. These concatenated sequences were studied using phylogenetic 
analysis, and the corresponding maximum parsimony (MP) tree was constructed (Figure 6A). The 
phylogeny of DNA-S and DNA-M (Taiwan isolate) received high bootstrap support (86.4) in the 
constructed tree, and the bootstrap support is even higher (88.7) when the sequences of BBTV 
(Australian isolate) were used in our analysis.  
In the second strategy, we applied rearrangement distance algorithms to estimate the

of a molecular clock. However, rearrangement also plays important roles in the process of evolution. 
Previous algorithms for estimating the rearrangement distance essentially require homologous genes 
or common regions as sequence markers. However, it is difficult to use homologous genes or 
common regions as markers because of the small genome size of most viruses. Although the idea of 
detecting micro markers in viruses for arrangement analysis has been proposed, determination of the 
optimal micro markers is actually an NP-hard problem. Here, we have used an approximation 
algorithm (MEME) to detect these micro markers and to apply statistical simulations to identify 
confidential markers. The application of these micro markers is not limited to rearrangement analysis, 
as some motifs that we detected are actually not shared by all genome components. These micro 
markers did not appear in every genome and hence cannot be used as rearranged markers. However, 
these micro markers may depict significant information that could help to clarify horizontal segment 
transfer (HST) events.  
In our study, we evaluated conserved motifs by molecular clock rearrangement strategies and 
by indexing the partially shared motifs found in sequence sets. However, our objective was not to 
fuse different results into a single inference; rather, our intent was to suggest that the consultation of 
results from different points of view may help us to better understand such complex evolutionary 
processes.

在執行本計畫中，我們利用計畫所得的研究成果與經驗，發展了兩個新的方法。這兩個方
法分別可應用在基因功能篩選與病毒演化的研究上，並且在實際應用上我們也證實了其實
用性與可行性。 
Part I: 
RNA 干擾(RNA interference, RNAi)普遍被應用在基因體規模的基因功能篩選。然而，傳
統的一對一的RNAi分析(針對一個目標基因即設計一個siRNA進行 RNAi實驗)需要消耗大
量的勞力與經費。已有研究顯示出 siRNA 對於近似完美互補(near-perfectly 
complementary)的基因也會有抑制效果，並且在本計畫的第一年裏，我們已成功的初步建
立了一資料比對系統。在給定兩個基因體(Genome)，以及長度 l、距離 d，這兩個參數的
情況下，利用將資料分類的方式，來加速後來此兩基因體中子片段的比對，進而得出所有
長度為 l且兩兩之間的漢明距離(Hamming Distance)皆小於 d的短片段序列。 
為了降低 RNAi 分析的成本，我們利用在本計畫的第一年裏建立的資料比對系統並結合群
試(Group testing)的概念，設計出了一個可以在大規模的 RNAi 分析實驗中幫助降低所需
RNAi 實驗次數的方法。並且利用蘭花(Orchid)的表現序列標幟(Expressed sequence tags, 
ESTs)來對我們的方法進行驗證。
