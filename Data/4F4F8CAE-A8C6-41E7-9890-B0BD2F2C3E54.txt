optimal process recipe using neural networks 
to establish the process model and intelligent 
genetic algorithm (IGA) to search for the 
global optimum. However, the production 
cycle time of some semiconductor processes 
is so short that metrology cannot keep up 
with the speed of fabrication. No metrology 
measurements will be available for 
run-to-run control. Hence, virtual metrology 
technique was also proposed for predicting 
the wafer outcomes. This technology 
provides accurate prediction to overcome the 
metrology delay problem in run-to-run 
control.

二、緣由與目的 
 
隨著資訊化科技的急遽發展與普及，
「輕、薄、短、小」的可攜式資訊產品，
如筆記型電腦、行動電話、數位相機等，
均快速發展與成長。早期 CRT 雖然廣泛應
用於電腦螢幕及儀表上，具有低成本、高
解析度以及較快的反應時間等優勢，但笨
重外殼、高耗電量以及所產生輻射對人體
有不良影響等缺點，致使 CRT 越來越不符
合潮流。反觀液晶顯示器具有薄型化、輕
量化、低耗電量、無輻射污染、與半導體
製程技術相容、產品應用廣泛等優點，在
短短數十年間，急速成長，成為市場的主
流，且隨著製程技術日趨成熟進步，其市
場競爭更加激烈。 
液晶顯示器的製造，以 TFT-LCD 來
講，包括 Array Process、Cell Process 與
Module Process 三 部 份 ， 其 中 Array 
Process(薄膜電晶體陣列製程)是非常關鍵
的製程。因此，本計劃以 Array Process 為
主，以建立完整製程控制系統，達到更精
確的故障偵測與控制之目的。 
薄膜電晶體陣列的製造可分為成膜技
術、光微影技術、蝕刻(Etch)技術以及光阻
去除技術等製程。在薄膜沉積方面可分機
能膜、絕緣膜、保護膜、電極膜、透明導
電膜、配向膜等相關的薄膜，其製程分為
物理氣相沉積(PVD)及化學氣相沉積(CVD)
兩種；薄膜沉積完成後，再使用微影技術
定義出整個精密矩陣型LCD控制點的結構
與圖形，經由蝕刻在玻璃基板上完成圖案
轉移，其流程如圖 1。由於大部分製程屬於
複雜且非線性之化學與物理反應，例如電
漿輔助化學氣相沉積(PECVD)牽涉到電漿
與反應性離子之變化，其製程反應機制複
雜，難以建構模型，加上製程常有漂動(Drift)
和變異(Shift)現象，以及缺乏線上檢測技術
(On-line Metrology)與 In-situ 感測器等因
素，使得製程狀態無法即時得知，也影響
到監控的有效性，常造成成本的損失。傳
統上 LCD 廠仍藉由統計製程管制理論
(Statistical Process Control，SPC)來管控製
程之各種異常。SPC 是基於資料為「獨立
且常態分配 (Identically Independent and 
Normally Distributed，IIND)」的假設，但
許多半導體製程設備的運轉狀況通常有非
靜態的(Non-stationary)，自關聯性的(Auto- 
correlated)及交互關聯性的(Cross-correlated)
特質，通常是因為反應物質或其衍生物累
積於機台內部元件上，或元件逐漸磨耗
(Wearing)的結果。當製程數據存有上述特
質時，SPC 誤判的機率會相對地增加，導
致製程偵測能力降低。 
有鑑於此，SIA Roadmap 在 1997 年將
先 進 製 程 控 制 技 術 (Advanced Process 
Control，APC)列為半導體產業的研發重
點，希望藉由嚴格的製程控制達到降低廢
片 、 提 增 設 備 的 使 用 率 與 產 能
(Throughput)，改善製程品質的目標。因
此，本子計畫旨在針對 TFT 薄膜電晶體元
件製程，研發先進製程控制技術，建立
TFT-LCD 之薄膜沉積製程的故障偵測與分
類及 Run-to-Run 控制系統。其成果分述如

三、製程故障偵測與分類 
 
3.1 薄膜沉積 
 
在機械工業、電子工業或半導體工業
領域，為了對所使用的材料賦與某種特
性，於材料表面上以各種方法形成被膜(一
層薄膜)加以使用，假如此被膜經由原子層
的過程所形成時，一般將此薄膜沈積稱為
蒸鍍(蒸著)處理。薄膜沈積依據沈積過程中
若無化學反應的機制者通常稱為物理氣相
沈積(Physical Vapor Deposition，PVD)，反
之，則通常稱為化學氣相沈積(Chemical 
Vapor Deposition，CVD)。 
薄膜沉積是一連串涉及吸附原子的吸
附過程，吸附原子在表面的擴散以及在適
當的階梯或頸結位置下聚結，漸漸形成薄
膜並成長的集合。薄膜化學氣相沉積經數
十年的發展，已成為半導體製程和
TFT-LCD 製程中最主要的薄膜製程工具。
在追求輕薄短小的目標下，發展更精確細
密的薄膜沉積技術也日益重要。薄膜的沉
積現象是粒子經由擴散運動、穩定的氣體
對流，經過界面邊界層傳送到晶片表面，
這些氣體分子或粒子在晶片表面會因為物
理擴散運動而失去動能，或氣體分子間化
學現象結合成固態粒子而附著在晶片表面
上。薄膜沉積的順序可分 (1)長晶：粒子通
過邊界層後到達晶片表面，這些時間短暫
停留的粒子可能會彈回氣體內或失去部份
動能而物理性的停留在晶體表面被吸附成
吸附原子，若再與其他吸附原子交互作用
可形成穩定的核團，核團經由交互吸附原
子長到一定程度大小即成為晶粒；(2)晶粒
成長：晶粒不僅可以吸附原子，也可直接
與氣流中的氣體粒子經由表面接觸吸附；
(3)晶粒凝聚：當晶粒成長到一定程度大小
便有機會與其他晶粒接觸，晶粒接觸後透
過彼此之間的交互擴散把整體的表面凝結
成大晶粒，而使得系統的表面能下降進而
穩定；(4)縫隙填補：當大晶粒與小晶粒互
相凝聚時，晶粒間的距離便縮小而成縫
隙，當縫隙逐漸被填滿後，便覆蓋形成薄
膜；(5)沉積膜成長：初步的薄膜形成後，
因薄膜沉積的快慢形成立體不規則形狀而
使薄膜的表面積增加，更加快吸附作用累
積薄膜厚度。其沉積機制如圖 2 [1]。 
 
 
圖 2、薄膜沉積順序。 (a)長晶；(b)晶粒成長；(c)
晶粒凝聚；(d)縫隙填補；(e)沉積膜成長 
 
整體薄膜的沉積速度與薄膜的結構可
說是與沉積進行的表面溫度密不可分，也
就是說，溫度愈高所成長的晶粒比較大，
沉積薄膜的均勻性(Uniformity)也就比較
好。 
CVD 反應依其操作壓力可分為四種
[2]： 
− 常壓 CVD(Atmospheric Pressure CVD，
APCVD) 
− 低壓CVD (Low Pressure CVD，LPCVD) 
− 電 漿 輔 助 CVD (Plasma Enhanced 
CVD，PECVD) 
− 高密度電漿 CVD (High Density Plasma 
CVD，HDPCVD) 
本計畫主要探討電漿輔助化學氣相沈
積(PECVD)，其沈積原理與一般的 CVD 並
沒有太大的差異。電漿中的反應物是化學
活性較高的離子或自由基，而且基板表面
受到離子的撞擊也會使得化學活性提高，

其 工 作 原 理 為 射 頻 產 生 器 (RF 
Generator) 輸出 RF Power (RF OUT)至
Matching Box(RF IN)，RF Power 在受負載
會先被 V.S.W.R(Power Detector)偵測出
Vr (反射功率)、 φV (電流及電壓的相位
差)、 ZV (阻抗)，並把資料傳至 Matching 
Controller (DET OUT)，Controller 再將傳來
的資料作計算，再依訊號進行匹配，而內
部的 CPU 會控制步進馬達(MP、MS)去調
整成一致性。圖 7 表示 Matching Box 與 RF 
Generator 之關係；圖 8 說明射頻訊號流程。 
 
 
圖7、Configuration of matching box 
 
 
圖 8、射頻訊號流程 
 
在 PECVD 製程中一個完整基板的成
膜過程，主要分兩個階段：第一個階段為
沉積，基板在成膜室裡，製程氣體經過一
連串反應，在基板表面沉積薄膜。第二階
段為清洗腔體(Clean)，清除基板上的微小
顆粒，避免在下一次製程中污染基板表
面，在清洗腔體階段傳遞功率 (Delivery 
power)會大於成膜階段。 
 
3.3.2 射頻產生器故障原因 
 
當射頻產生器產生傳遞功率到製程反
應室時，會產生反射功率，如果反射功率
過大，射頻產生器超出所能負荷之範圍，
則會引響正常射頻功率輸出，造成功率損
失的故障發生，使反應室射頻功率不足，
無法產生電漿，使得製程發生中斷情形。
圖 9(a)是正常狀態下的射頻功率，相對於
圖 9(b)則是發生了功率損失的情形。實線
為傳遞功率，虛線為反射功率，由圖可以
看出受到反射功率上升的影響，傳遞功率
無法持續，接著產生了功率損失的故障，
使得製程不完全，進而影響到下一批次的
薄膜沉膜。 
而在正常製程狀況下，傳遞功率有固
定的輸出大小數值，但反射功率卻會因其
它因素如匹配器(Matching Box)或功率傳
送的路徑等硬體架構的影響，使得信號的
變化情形不相同。如圖 10 為 RF Power 在
清洗腔體(Clean)階段，實線為傳遞功率
(Delivery power)數值曲線，虛線為反射功
率(Reflection power)數值曲線。

由圖 10 可知，當傳遞功率趨於穩定
後，反射功率仍隨時間而變，這些異動會
明顯的表現在小波係數上，如圖 12，雖然
會超過警戒線，但仍在有限範圍內，因此
不能發出故障警報。我們將正常運作下的
四組小波係數中極大值定義為上控制極限
(UCL)亦即臨界值，而其負數則稱為下控制
極限(LCL)。假設波峰值超過 UWL 但仍小
於 UCL，則我們只發出警告而非故障警
報。相對地，若波峰值超過 UCL，則會立
刻發出故障警報。利用具有正常及異常製
程狀態離線資料建立離線偵測系統，其結
果可正確偵測出離線資料的故障發生。 
 
(2) 線上移動視窗故障偵測: 
根據Bakshi在1999年提出的線上多尺
度過濾的論點，使用隨時間而變的移動視
窗規則[18]。其視窗必須為平方數(dyadic 
number)單位長度，在此我們設定初始值為
22 接著為 23, 24,…以此類推。舉例來說，隨
著時間而增加的量測資料，一開始以單位
長度 4 的輸入資料為視窗作分析，如圖
13，當擷取新的資料數目達到 8 單位長度
時，再移動視窗將新擷取的資料包含產生
新視窗，接著再進行視窗內資料進行小波
分解，產生小波係數，以離線多分辨率分
析是否超出臨界值。

3.3.4 故障偵測結果與討論 
 
利用 PECVD 成膜機台 UNAXIS 
KAI-800 的實際製程參數為實驗，以
Daubechies 小波作訊號分解，會得到低頻
近似與高頻細節的數值，此時系統所產生
的殘值便是擷取高頻細節的小波係數 di。
以下為偵測系統偵測兩個異常狀況為例，
我們以連續的六個 run 為參數資料來解釋
說明，其中最後一個 run 因 power loss 而發
生異常。圖 14 為第一個反應器運作
Delivery 與 Reflection powers 參數圖，前五
個 run 中，兩者皆無偵測出故障，而第六
個 run 起初並無異狀，但在小波偵測系統
上卻預先偵測出異常的 Reflection Power，
對比於原始數據，可以看出在發生 Power 
Loss 前小波係數值已超出管制界限，因
此，可以判斷故障的產生，即時發出警報。
如圖 15，可看出在 Reflection Power 資料中
第 114 號偵測到小波係數超出 UCL，之後
115 號另一個波峰也超出 LCL。

3.4.2 類神經網路-競爭式學習法 
 
本研究以競爭式網路 (Competitive 
Network)為主，其神經元會學習辨識相似
的輸入向量，藉 Kohonen 學習規則調節勝
利神經元的權重值，Kohonen 學習規則允
許神經元的權重值學習輸入向量，並且因
為這在辨識應用方面有用，因此權重值向
量中最靠近輸入向量的神經元被更新且更
靠近。結果是當下次提供相似的輸入向量
時，這個勝利的神經元更可能贏得競爭，
而且當提供很多不同的輸入向量時，就更
不可能贏，本方法屬於非監督式類神經網
路，因此 WAT 資料可直接輸入到網路中直

其中η為學習速率，n為學習過程中的疊代

利用訊息理論失真率計算出每筆正常

3.4.3 故障診斷結果 
 
(1) Normal data (Training Data): 
如圖 23，在十筆正常 SE 製程的清潔
階段原始波形中，雖為同一位置產出，但
已有些許差異，其訊號的不穩定性是非常
明顯的，整體所產生之反射功率約在 150W
至 300W 間，而最容易產生故障點為
Reflection Power 變化較大的區間。 
利用小波轉換之小波細節繪出十筆資
料平均分佈範圍，當原始波形變化大時，
在小波細節內會產生突波，因此計算出
normal data 的訊號變化狀況如圖 24，利用
小波細節建立出的標準圖形進行後續故障
診斷。 
小波近似為觀察原始波形之整體變
化，再計算出十筆資料每個位置的平均範
圍後所繪製成如圖 25，主要可得知在正常
情況下波形移動位置，將此 normal data 建
立後，後續與每筆資料進行驗證，進行異
常分析。

圖 28、Generator 故障-近似(Testing data) 
 
(3) Solenoid 故障原始 data: 
圖 29 為電磁閥故障之波形，其特徵多
集中於開始清潔的 50 秒內即發生故障，而
Reflection Power變化也是最大者，約為 200
至 700W 間，之後直到清潔結束皆無輸出
與反射功率產生。 
圖30為電磁閥故障資料經小波細節轉
換後與正常資料比對，故障資訊在清潔初
即產生大幅功率變化，約在 75 秒後就無功
率再輸出，此種現象即清潔失敗。 
再觀察此故障之小波近似圖形如圖
31，可發現清潔之初 Reflection Power 超出
正常值許多，之後因造成清潔環境條件已
改變，導致清潔失敗，此類型即為電磁閥
故障。

總合以上結果，將各種所有訊號資料
計算出其特徵值(即失真率)，再利用類神經
競爭式學習法分類後可發現不同故障具有
不同位置的群聚現象如圖 32，藍色圓圈代

Abstract. As the semiconductor industry moves toward ULSI era, stringent and 
robust fault detection technique becomes an essential requirement. Most of the 
semiconductor processes have nonlinear dynamics and exhibit inevitable steady 
drift in nature, traditional statistical process control (SPC) must be used to-
gether with the time series model in order to detect any nonrandom departure 
from the desired target. However, it is difficult to create the time series model 
and sometimes found not tolerant to non-stationary variation. To overcome this 
difficulty, a fault detection technique using radial basis function (RBF) neural 
network was developed to learn the characteristics of process variations. It is 
adaptive and robust for processes subject to tolerable drift and for varied proc-
ess setpoints. Therefore, equipment malfunctions and/or faults can be detected 
and the false alarms can be avoided. 
1   Introduction 
As the semiconductor industry strides toward the ULSI era, not only the device ge-
ometry continues to shrink but also the fabrication processes become more complex. 
Most of the semiconductor processes have nonlinear dynamics due to the physical 
and/or chemical reactions. Moreover, many of them exhibit inevitable steady drift in 
nature because of the gradual wearing-out phenomena or build-up of material on the 
components of the tools. In order to increase the throughput and to reduce the scraps, 
stringent and robust fault detection technique is obviously an essential requirement 
for promoting better quality control and higher overall equipment efficiency (OEE). 
Currently, statistical process control (SPC) is the most commonly used method for 
the monitoring of manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry. The im-
plementation of SPC is based on the assumption that the data must be identically, 
independently and normally distributed (IIND). Any nonrandom variation away from 
the desired target can be then detected using control charts. 
However, the process drift explains that the data collected from tools are generally 
non-stationary, in addition, auto-correlated or cross-correlated. SPC method cannot 
be applied directly on these data. The process dependencies must be modeled and 
filtered out with appropriate time series models so that the residual is IIND for SPC 
implementation [1],[2]. 
The major motivation of this research is to develop a simple fault detection system 
that captures the dependencies in the process by learning the characteristics of proc-
540      Yaw-Jen Chang 
that it offers a variety of applications in the curve fitting (approximation) problems 
and suit the requirements of fault detection for the complicated systems. 
The RBF network consists of three layers including input, hidden, and output 
layer. Differing from the neural networks with sigmoidal activation functions, it util-
izes Gaussian functions in the hidden layer. Thus, the training procedure of RBF 
neural network requires a learning algorithm to determine both the center and the 
width of each Gaussian function. 
3.1   Design of RBF Fault Detection System 
Let the time series }1:][{ NnnvS ≤≤=  represent a collection of N observations 
sampled in discrete time fashion Nn ,,2,1 !=  with sampling interval T. In order to 
learn the correct characteristics of process variation, it is very important that the time 
series must include enough data for extracting out complete pattern, for instance, the 
observations have to cover at least one period of cyclical variation. An analysis win-
dow [7], illustrated in figure 1, moving forward at each time increment T was adopted 
for tracing dynamic data. The right side of each window corresponds to the current 
time n. Assume that each window has length d and contains d+1 consecutive observa-
tions from S, that is, v[n], , v[n  d]. Define

d-k+1 components represent network inputs and the last component represents the 
desired output. 
The new training data derived from time series S render RBF network useful for 
tracing drift rate of every time instant and forecasting the next drift behavior. There is 
a tradeoff between precision of pattern learning and computation burden. 
3.2   Control Chart 
Since the control chart is a simple and effective graphical representation of the proc-
ess status, it serves as a fundamental vehicle in SPC for monitoring variations. In this 
study, the concept of control chart was also employed for RBF fault detection system. 
When implementing this RBF network for fault detection, the comparison of the 
estimated output ny  to the desired output ny  yields a mean square error σ calculated

test the performance of RBF detector under a varied manufacturing environment.

In this study, the fault detection system was implemented to a Lam 490 plasma 
etcher. The basic components of a typical plasma etching system, depicted in Fig-
ure 6, include: (1) the reaction chamber where the etching process takes place; (2) an 
RF power supply to create the plasma; (3) the pumping system for establishing and 
maintaining the reduced pressure; and (4) the gas supply system to meter and control 
the flow of reactant gases.  A wide range of reactant chemistries is used, for example, 
silicon nitride (Si3N4) is commonly etched by carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) that is mixed 
with O2 and N2. The RF power is utilized to ionize the gases and, thus, produce 
chemically reactive species which can react with the material to be etched. During the 
plasma etching process, the chamber pressure must be precisely controlled. 
Therefore, the pressure in the etching chamber of Lam 490 was investigated. Tool 
data collected through SECS were found that the pressure measurements were influ-
enced by the switching of RF power. These two parameters revealed a level of highly 
cross-correlated relationship which is shown schematically in Figure 7. In this case it 
is obviously difficult to establish the model of pressure. Furthermore, it is also per-
plexed to implement SPC to monitor the pressure.

Virtual Metrology Technique for Semiconductor Manufacturing
Yaw-Jen Chang, Yuan Kang, Chih-Liang Hsu, Chi-Tim Chang, and Tat Yan Chan
Abstract— IC metrology is a necessary means for measuring
the fabrication performance in the semiconductor industry. It is
significant for yield enhancement and process control. However,
real-time monitoring of wafer production is required in recent
years especially for the 300mm semiconductor manufacturing.
Therefore, virtual metrology (VM) is developed for the tide
of demand. It is a novel technology to predict the process
results based on the previous metrology measurements, instead
of measuring practically. Consequently it can assist in achieving
total quality management and enable run-to-run control. In
this paper a systematic methodology for virtual metrology is
proposed. This VM system which is mainly designed for the
process subject to linear process drift consists of a piecewise
linear neural network and a fuzzy neural network. Because
many semiconductor processes exhibit inevitable steady drifts
in nature, the design of piecewise linear neural network is to
approximate the drift trend. In addition, the influence of process
recipe on fabrication outcome is learned using the fuzzy neural
network. The system has good generalization capability and
performance. Thus, it provides an effective and economical
solution for metrology prediction.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the creation of the first IC device in 1960, the
semiconductor industry started growing rapidly. The density
of devices manufactured on silicon substrates has been
marvelously increased in recent years. As the semiconductor
industry strides forward into the ULSI era, not only the
device geometry continues to shrink but also the fabrication
processes become more complex. Nowadays the typical IC
fabrication may involve 350 or more process steps. Each pro-
cess step has specific quality standards. Thus, IC metrology,
after each process, is a necessary means for measuring the
fabrication performance. It plays two important roles in the
process flow. First, the semiconductor industry continually
faces quality control challenges. Metrology tools provide
cutting edge solutions to measure critical process parameters
such as thickness, composition, and roughness of thin films,
etc. These tools inspect whether the wafer result has defect
or not, which is strongly relating to the yield. Obviously,
metrology is significant for yield enhancement and process
development. Second, most of the semiconductor processes
have nonlinear dynamics due to the physical and/or chemical
reactions. Moreover, many of them suffer from drift and
disturbance. Therefore, the process recipe has to be modified
between runs based on the metrology measurements so as to
minimize the influence of process drift and variation, in ad-
dition, to keep the fabrication in a tighter control to improve

device performance and process yield. It is the so-called run-
to-run control. Metrology is essential during the advanced
semiconductor manufacturing to sustain yield performance at
every stage. Again, metrology is indispensable to the process
control.
However, thousands of wafers are processed in a fab per
day. To inspect every wafer, plenty metrology tools will be
needed and it will be time-consuming. Due to the consid-
eration of operation cost and efficiency, only a few wafers
per lot are inspected. On the other hand, the production
cycle time of some semiconductor processes is so short that
metrology cannot keep up with the speed of fabrication.
Under this condition, no metrology measurements will be
available for run-to-run control. It leads to the metrology de-
lay problem. For the 300mm semiconductor manufacturing,
real-time monitoring of wafer production has evoked great
attention [1][2]. The traditional wafer inspections that require
waiting for a full cassette to be processed before monitoring
the results will be no longer appropriate.
The competitive markets always give an impetus to the
industries to develop efficient but low-cost technologies.
Virtual metrology (VM) is a novel terminology in the semi-
conductor industrial circles in recent years [3]. It refers to
the technology that estimates the process results based on
the previous metrology measurements, instead of measuring
practically. There are many advantages to virtual metrology
including
• Reducing wafer scraps: process inspection can be per-
formed through VM for every wafer to sustain yield
performance
• Tighter process control: VM provides a basis to over-
come the metrology delay problem for run-to-run con-
trol
• Increasing throughput: wafer handling from process tool
to metrology tool can be reduced and, thus, production
cycle time can be shorted
The development of virtual metrology does not aim to
replace stand-alone metrology tools, but to assist in achieving
total quality management and process control. However, the
research progress is still tardy because of the lack of relevant
theory. Thus, the major motivation of this study is to develop
a systematic methodology for virtual metrology. Both the
influence of process recipe and the trend of process drift are
considered so as to predict the wafer results. The remainder
of this paper is organized as follows: Section II addresses
the design of virtual metrology system using artificial neural
networks. Section III discusses the simulation results of CMP
process. Finally, a conclusion is stated in section IV.

where t is the target that is the clustering data in time series

minimize the cost function by means of gradient descent

A numerical example displays the implementation of
piecewise linear neural network for tracing the drift trend as
shown in Fig. 4. The solid line describes the measurements

while the dotted line explains the estimation of process trend.

B. Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN)
Numerous researches have shown that fuzzy neural net-
works are satisfactory in handling ill-defined and uncertain
systems. Thus, for many semiconductor processes, as men-
tioned in the previous section, process recipe does not have
deterministic relationship with the wafer result. The relation
had better be described using fuzzy logic. Therefore, in
this study a general four-layer FNN structure is used. The
function of each layer is elaborated as follows [4].
Layer 1: The nodes in the first layer represent the input
linguistic variables.
Layer 2: Each node represents a fuzzy membership func-
tion. The net input and output are related by
µij = exp − (xi − cij)
σj
, i = 1, · · · , n, j = 1, · · · ,m
where n is the number of input variables; m is the number
of membership functions and herein is equal to 3; cij and
σj are, respectively, the mean and the standard deviation of
the jth Gaussian membership function, which takes the ith
linguistic variable xi as input.
Layer 3: The rule layer. Each node denotes a possible IF-
part for fuzzy rules and has relationship as
ωj =
m
j
exp − (xi − cij)
σj
, j = 1, · · · ,m.
Layer 4: The output layer. The output variable is defined
as
Ψi =
m
j exp − xi−cij
2
σ2j
s
k exp − xi−cij
2
σ2j
and
Y = ω jΨi =
m
j ω j exp − xi−cij
2
σ2j
s
k exp − xi−cij
2
σ2j
where s is the number of training data and ω j is the weight
of each rule.
For the TSK model
ω j = kj + kj x + · · ·+ kjnxn, j = 1, · · · ,m.
Similar to linear neural network, the learning algorithm
for FNN is to minimize the mean square error by means of
gradient descent method.
The main functionality of this fuzzy neural network is to
establish the process model. Hence, in order to precisely
describe the relationship between the recipe and process
response in an ideal operating condition, the drift trend must
be deducted from the historical measurement data using
piecewise linear neural network. Assume that the time series
of metrology data S is partitioned into k clusters with Ci
denoting the respective linear trend, for i = 1 to k. Thus,
there are k − 1 discontinuities. The learning target can be
calculated by
• For each cluster, calculate the differences between the
metrology data and the linear trend.
• At each discontinuity, calculate the difference of two
contiguous trends at this point. These values express
the process shift.
Besides, the training input is the process recipe. FNN has
merits to tolerate noise as well as recipe fine-tune situation.
It possesses good generalization capability and suits to the
complicated manufacturing environment.

The accuracy of virtual metrology can be affected by the
random noise. The larger noise may lead to the worse predic-
tion accuracy. It cannot be improved because the influence
of noise on VM accuracy is ineluctable. However, the most
important performance for a VM system is to forecast the
process dynamics even though the recipe is adjusted.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Because many semiconductor processes exhibit inevitable
steady drifts in nature, adjustment of process recipe is the
key to keep the process performance and yield. However, to
predict the wafer outcome becomes a perplexity due to the
shift of fabrication performance. In this paper a systematic
methodology for virtual metrology is proposed. This VM
system which is mainly designed for the process subject
to linear process drift consists of a piecewise linear neural
network and a fuzzy neural network to perform the estimation
of process trend and shift, respectively. The system was
proven to have good performance from the simulation of
CMP process. It possesses good generalization capability and
is able to predict the process shifts whenever the recipe is
adjusted.
This novel technology provides an economical solution
for total quality management. Furthermore, it also provides
accurate prediction to overcome the metrology delay problem
in run-to-run control.

engineers to monitor the equipment and process, to 
precisely detect faults in real-time, and to avoid 
issuing false alarms. 
PECVD utilizing plasma energy to create and 
sustain CVD reaction is an important deposition 
process for the construction of TFT layers. Generally 
speaking, stable RF power is a basic requirement for 
the success of deposition process. Any malfunctions 
on RF power can cause yield loss. However, RF 
power loss is a common malfunction that occurs 
usually without any omen in advance. 
There are several kinds of techniques available 
for fault detection. For instance, it is not surprising 
that the model-based method is popularly used in the 
industry (Chen, 1999). It utilizes an explicit 
mathematical model of the monitored system. Once 
the model is precisely built-up, any system fault 
would be difficult to flee from the detector. However, 
the performance of the model-based approach 
depends strongly on the accuracy of the models. 
Currently, model-free methods, or called data-
driven approaches, are widely used in practice, for 
example, statistical process control (SPC) is the most 
common method for process monitoring (Spanos, 
1992). It involves using statistical techniques to 
analyze the variation in processes. Firstly, the 
readings of process variables are collected from the 
tools through the protocol of SECS. Then, SPC 
measures variation from these readings and sets 
control limits. The implementation of SPC is based 
on the assumption that the data must be identically, 
independently and normally distributed (IIND). Any 
nonrandom variation away from the desired target 
can be then detected using control charts. 
Alternatively, artificial neural network (ANN) is 
another model-free technique and has been 
successfully used in the areas of fault detection 
because of its ability to learn complex nonlinear 
functions (Zhang, 1998)(Chang, 2005). It is able to 
overcome the shortcomings of model-based 
techniques because an ANN does not require the 
detailed knowledge about the system for establishing 
its model. 
In recent years, wavelet theory has evoked great 
research interests. The idea of wavelets was first 
proposed by Haar in 1909. Morlet is one of the 
pioneers to provide a way of thinking for wavelets 
based on physical intuition when he analyzed the 
geophysical data in the early 1980s. In 1985, Mallat 
proposed the concept of multiresolution analysis and 
made some fundamental contributions to the 
development of the wavelet theory. Daubechies, in 
1988, introduced the existence of orthonormal bases 
of wavelets with finite support, which led to the 
development of discrete wavelet transform and many 
important applications. Nowadays, wavelet theory 
has been widely used in the areas of fault detection 
and process monitoring. For instance, Zhang and Yan 
(2001) employed the wavelet-based approach to the 
abrupt fault detection and diagnosis of sensors and 
accurately localized the characteristics both in the 
time and frequency domains. Ganesan et al (2003) 
applied wavelet-based multiscale method in the 
identification of delamination defect of low-k 
dielectric in CMP process. 
The major motivation of this research is to 
develop a real-time wavelet-based fault detection 
system for detecting RF power loss of PECVD 
process in the TFT-LCD fabrication. The remainder 
of this paper is organized as follows: Section II and 
III present a brief introduction to both the wavelet 
transform and the PECVD process. Section IV 
addresses the design of fault detection system for RF 
power loss in the PECVD process. Section V 
discusses the experimental results. Finally, a 
conclusion is stated in section VI. 
 
 
WAVELET TRANSFORM 
 
Wavelets are a family of basis functions which is 
represented as 
 
)(1)(
s
t
s
ts
τψψ τ −=  (1) 
 
where s and τ denote the dilation and translation 
parameters, respectively. They are localized in both 
time and frequency. The continuous wavelet 
transform (CWT) can be defined as follows. 
 
dtttfs s )()(),( ,
∗∫= τψτγ  (2) 
 
where * denotes complex conjugation. Thus, the basic 
idea behind the wavelet analysis is that a signal can 
be decomposed into a set of basis functions. 
For most practical applications, the discrete 
wavelets are introduced by discretizing the dilation 
and translation parameters dyadically. This family of 
wavelets is represented as 
 
)2(2)( 2/ ktt jjjk −= −− ψψ . (3) 
 
Similarly, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) 
can decompose a signal into its constituent elements 
using basis functions. If the signal is smooth, the 
coefficients after DWT are small; while the abrupt 
change in the signal will result in extreme peak of 
wavelet coefficients. This concept was used in this 
paper for fault detection. 
 
 
PECVD PROCESS 
 
The plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(PECVD) is an important process for the deposition

Figure 3 RF power in cleaning step: the solid lines 
describe the delivery power, while the dotted lines 
explain the reflection power which has diverse 
magnitude from run to run 
 
In the off-line stage, four runs of data which 
must be in the normal operation condition, i.e. in-
control data, were collected from the same reactor. 
They were used in establishing the threshold limits 
for fault detection. However, the RF power is 
generated and rises up to the target value during the 
first two seconds of the cleaning step. It is a transient 
response. Thus, the initial instability data were 
prescreened in order to prevent large wavelet 
coefficients. That is, the monitoring of reflection 
power is performed after the delivery power turns to 
steady state. It is comprehensible that the more runs 
of normal data are collected, the more precise 
threshold limits can be obtained. 
After the preliminary preparation, four sets of in-
control data were then decomposed separately into 
three levels using Daubechies sixth-order wavelet 
basis functions. The corresponding wavelet and 
scaling function coefficients were obtained. Fault 
detection system can be now set up by limit checking 
of wavelet and scaling function coefficients as 
illustrated in Figure 4. Generally speaking, the 
scaling function coefficients describe the coarse 
approximation of magnitude of reflection power. 
They do not contribute any further information to the 
detection of the subtle changes in the system. 
Therefore, we focused our discussion on the wavelet 
coefficients. 
 
 
Figure 4 Multiscale fault detection system 
 
Usually faults are detected by setting a threshold. 
A larger threshold value, obviously, is easy to cause 
missing detection; while a tighter threshold value 
may result in false alarms. Selection of threshold 
limit is crucial. In this study, the threshold rule 
derived by Donoho et al (1995) is adopted, which is 
given as follows. 
 
σ(N)λ log2=  (4) 
 
where N is the signal length and σ is the noise level. 
Figure 5 shows the four sets of wavelet function 
coefficients. For each set of wavelet coefficients, the 
threshold value λi was calculated by (4), where i = 
1, …, 4. Then, the threshold limit was defined as 
 
),,,max( 4321max λλλλλ =  (5) 
 
and was called the upper warning limit (UWL) with 
its negative value as lower warning limit (LWL). 
Most wavelet coefficients are within the positive and 
negative threshold limits. Note that only wavelet 
function coefficients of level 1 is shown in Figure 5, 
the same procedures must be implemented for the 
other levels. 
 
 
Figure 5 wavelet coefficients and threshold limits 
 
The plot of raw data in Figure 3 indicates that the 
reflection power may vary with time even though the 
delivery power is stable. These abrupt changes 
produce large coefficients in wavelet domain, which 
exceed the threshold but within a finite range. Owing 
to the known in-control equipment status, we cannot 
highlight them as faults. Therefore, the maximum in 
the four sets of wavelet coefficients was set to be the 
upper control limit (UCL) and its negative value as 
lower control limit (LCL), respectively. If a peak 
value exceeds UWL but less than UCL, only a 
warning will be issued to indicate the subtle change 
in the reflection power. It does not influence the 
delivery power and the PECVD process. On the

Slight change of reflection power will not make a 
great impact on the delivery power. Indeed, our 
system did not issue a false alarm.

CONCLUSION 
 
Stable RF power is a crucial requirement for 
creating and sustaining CVD reaction. If the 
reflection power gets too high and exceeds the 
capacity limit of RF generator, the normal output of 
delivery power is then affected. At this moment, the 
efficiency of RF generator is reduced so that there is 
no enough RF power to keep creating and sustaining 
CVD reaction. The PECVD process, either in the 
deposition phase or in the cleaning step, will 
terminate, perhaps, without any omen in advance. 
In this paper, the wavelet-based fault detection 
approach is shown as a powerful tool for equipment 
malfunction and, furthermore, the reflection power is 
found to be the effective factor for detecting the fault 
of RF power loss. This approach can detect the subtle 
changes in the reflection power and issue an alarm 
before RF power loss occurs.

local features. Usually, the time response of a process can be
divided into two parts: the transient response and the steady-
state response. By means of feature neurons, one can monitor
not only the steady-state response but also the transient
response. It is a new feature that is difficult for the SPC
to reach. Obviously, the more feature neurons are used, the
more precise signal characteristics can be captured. Thus, the
number of feature neurons must depend on the complexity of
the waveform signal. Without loss of generality, in this paper,
three feature neurons are adopted for explanation. Therefore,
for a class of waveform signals of an uncertain dynamic
process, three groups of feature neurons can be obtained.
The locations of feature neurons in a group may scatter over
a bounded region. If the process is in-control, they all stand
for “good” status. Thus, ellipses are employed to encircle
each group of feature neurons and act as threshold limits.
By limit checking, this approach can extract any abnormal
deviation in the process characteristics in an unsophisticated
manner. The procedure is depicted in Figure 2 and elaborated
as follows.
A. Kohonen Network
The Kohonen network [4], as shown in Figure 3, is used in
this study. It is an unsupervised learning network. Learning
is based on the clustering of input data to group similar
objects and separate dissimilar ones. The learning rule is
called competitive learning or winner-take-all learning. The
number of classes is set to be r which is the number of

feature neurons placed on a waveform signal and is known a
priori. The time series of the waveform signals, which must
be normalized before they are used, serve as the training data.
Hence, the Kohonen network classifies the training data into
one of the specified r categories. The Kohonen learning rule
is described as follows.

where α k is the learning rate. The outputs are the weight
vectors that represent the coordinates of the feature neurons.
B. Ellipsoidal Calculus
The analytical description of a general convex set involves
a large number of parameters and requires significant compu-
tations. On the contrary, an ellipsoidal set can be represented
by its center and a positive definite matrix characterizing its
“shape.” In this way the number of parameters necessary for
the description of an ellipsoidal set is moderate. Therefore,
there are significant advantages for approximating arbitrary
compact convex sets using ellipsoids. However, for any
compact convex set given, there are an infinite number of
ellipsoids which contain the set and are qualified as external
approximations. The volume of the ellipsoidal approximation
can be used as a criterion for “optimal” approximation.
Let E(a,Q) denote an ellipsoid {x ∈ n | (x −
a)TQ− (x− a) ≤ 1}, where a ∈ n denotes the center and
Q is a symmetric positive definite n × n matrix. Since we
consider the feature extraction approach for single process
parameter in this study, only the ellipses in canonical form
are needed for calculating the threshold limits; namely, Q is
a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix and the semiaxes of the ellipsoid
lie on the respective coordinate axes. In addition, E(a,Q)
must cover all the feature neurons obtained from the Kohonen
network.

where ζ and ωn are real constants, called damping ratio
and undamped natural frequency, respectively. Obviously, the
dynamic behavior of the second-order system is related to
the parameters ζ and ωn. If 0 < ζ < 1, the system has
oscillatory transient response. It becomes more difficult to
draw out the signal characteristics. Nevertheless, the transient
response is necessarily important, since both the amplitude
and the time duration of the transient response must be kept
within tolerable limits.
In this study, two cases were investigated. As shown in
Figure 9(a), the damping ratio ζ’s of the three waveform
signals are assumed to be identical and equal to 0.2, while
the undamped natural frequency ωn’s are 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6,
respectively. In Figure 9(b), on the contrary, the undamped
natural frequencies are identically to be 0.4, while the
damping ratios are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively.
The feature extraction approach was implemented to these

waveform signals and, however, the feature neurons are
located nearby because the oscillatory transient response neu-
tralize their effect on feature neuron each other, as shown in
Figure 9. Therefore, for such second-order control systems,
this approach must be applied to each feature neuron area
again in order to analyze the signal characteristics in detail.
That is, a section of waveform signal adjacent to the feature
neuron must be cut and serve as new input to the Kohonen
network for calculating three new feature neurons in this
local section of waveform signal. Thus, the amount of feature
neurons is augmented to nine for a waveform signal. The
result is shown in Figure 10.

may lead to defect products and increase the operating costs.
Hence, preventive maintenance is a scheduled maintenance
action aiming to prevent the breakdowns and failures of
equipment before they actually occur. Thanks to PM, the

Feature Extraction of Waveform Signals for Uncertain Dynamic
Processes Using Neural Networks
Yaw-Jen Chang, Chi-Tim Chang, and Jui-Ju Tsai
Abstract— This paper presents a novel and simple feature
extraction approach for drawing out the signal characteristics of
uncertain dynamic processes by the feature neurons. Kohonen
network is used to construct the feature neurons to represent
its respective local features of a waveform signal. For a class of
waveform signals, groups of feature neurons can be obtained.
Incorporating with the ellipsoidal calculus, this approach can
extract the process drifts and abnormal deviations in the process
characteristics by limit checking. Moreover, it is robust even
for the process with different process time durations. For the
system with oscillatory transient response, this approach can
be iteratively used to augment the amount of feature neurons
to analyze the characteristics of any portion of the signal of
interest in detail. With the merit of unsophisticatedness, this
approach can be implemented for the determination of pre-
ventive maintenance and fault detection in the semiconductor
manufacturing.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the real world, most systems are usually subject to
uncertainties. The term “uncertain dynamic process” is used
to refer to the presence of uncertainties in dynamic system
such that the value of process parameter varies from run to
run. For instance, many semiconductor manufacturing pro-
cesses, due to the physical and/or chemical reactions, exhibit
inevitable drift in nature because of the gradual wearing-
out phenomena or build-up of material on the components
of the tools. In addition, processes may be also subject to
disturbances. Thus, some parameters may reveal different
values in magnitude from run to run even though they
have fixed set-points. Such processes are uncertain dynamic
processes. Obviously, analysis of these parameter signals is
the basis of understanding an uncertain dynamic process.
Waveform signals represent a class of signals of a cer-
tain process parameter collected from in-situ sensor in an
uncertain dynamic process. In general, the waveform signals
hold information related to both product quality and process
status so that they can be used for the determination of
preventive maintenance (PM), monitoring and diagnosis for
manufacturing process, etc. Up to now, many approaches
for the analysis of waveform signals were proposed and
implemented. For instance, the model-based method utilizes
an explicit mathematical model of the monitored system to
mimic the real process behavior. Thus, by observing the
difference between the real process response and model
output, engineers are able to capture the equipment faults or
to decide whether the preventive maintenance is necessary

or not in order to prevent the breakdowns and failures of
equipment before they actually occur.
Currently, model-free methods, or called data-driven ap-
proaches, are widely used in practice, for example, statistical
process control (SPC) is the most commonly used method
in the semiconductor industry for monitoring, controlling
and improving a process through statistical analysis [1]. By
measuring the mean, variance and others, any nonrandom
variation away from the desired target can be then detected
using control charts. Based on these results, engineers can
take appropriate actions. However, the implementation of
SPC is based on the assumption that the data must be
identically, independently and normally distributed (IIND).
For most waveform signals, SPC cannot be utilized directly.
Alternatively, feature extraction of waveform signals is
another feasible approach. It involves simplifying the amount
of resources and drawing out the signal characteristics accu-
rately. In recent years, feature extraction has evoked great
research interest in the areas of feature construction, sparse
representations, and feature selection, etc. The techniques
have been implemented in a variety of applications including
image processing, bioinformatics, speech processing, and
pattern recognition [2]. Besides, Jin and Shi, in 2001, de-
veloped a diagnostic system using waveform signals for
fault detection and diagnosis [3]. The merits of this system
include automatic fault detection, optimal feature extraction,
and optimal feature subset selection.
The major motivation of this research is to develop a
feature extraction approach for uncertain dynamic processes
using neural networks. Rather than making much effort to
establish precise process model, this proposed method is a
data-driven approach and simply places feature neurons on
a waveform signal to represent its respective local features.
Incorporating with ellipsoidal calculus, this approach can be
implemented for PM determination and fault detection by
limit checking. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows: Section II addresses the approach of feature
extraction. Section III discusses the simulation results. An
example of the determination of preventive maintenance
based on feature extraction approach is discussed in section
VI. Finally, a conclusion is stated in section V.

drawing out the signal characteristics. The basic idea is
quite straightforward. As shown schematically in Figure 1,
for a waveform signal, three (or more) feature neurons are
constructed by Kohonen network to represent its respective

T and having its major axis parallel to the y-axis may
be specified by the equation
(x− a1)

= 1
where α and β are the lengths of the semimajor and
semiminor axes, respectively. To find the optimal external
approximation of the feature neurons, this ellipse must pass
the farthest neuron. It becomes an easy geometric problem.
III. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS
To verify the functionality of feature extraction approach,
this section is concerned with the simulations. Two different
types of uncertain dynamic processes were studied in this
paper.
First, consider an uncertain dynamic process with fixed
set-point but, physically, its mean varying within a range
from run to run. Additionally, the process is subject to noise.
To evaluate the threshold limits, assume that m runs of
historical in-control data are collected. In case every run
has identical process time, it is an unsophisticated situation
and the statistical process control can be implemented well.
The plot of waveform signals in Figure 4(a) indicates that
their process means varies within 240 to 250. In addition,
the process is subject to white noise with N(0, 1). A total of
twenty runs of in-control data, with the same duration of 100,
were used for the training of the Kohonen network. As shown
in Figure 4(b), three sets of ellipses encircling each respective
group of feature neurons were then calculated and acted as
threshold limits. After the training stage, another seven runs
of data as shown in Figure 5(a) were utilized to test the
system. By the Kohonen network, their feature neurons were
calculated and compared with the ellipsoidal threshold limits.
Figure 5(b) explains that there is a waveform signal beyond
the limits because its mean is too high. Another signal is
detected to have one feature neuron beyond the limit due to
the process drift. Hence, this proposed approach is able to
detect abnormal deviations in the signal characteristics.
However, if every run has different process time, the
monitoring of manufacturing process becomes a perplexity
for engineers. Unfortunately, it is a common phenomenon
in the semiconductor manufacturing processes. To examine
this proposed feature extraction approach, twenty runs of
in-control data, with different durations, were used for the
training of the Kohonen network. Figure 6(a) shows only five

runs of test data and 6(b) illustrates their feature neurons
and ellipsoidal threshold limits. Again, another seven runs
of data as shown in Figure 7(a) were utilized to test the
system. The results show that this proposed feature extraction
approach is robust for the uncertain dynamic process with
different process time in every run. Moreover, if the process
is terminated too early, it might be a faulty case and can be
detected properly, as shown in Figure 7(b).
Next, we consider the second-order control systems whose
analysis generally helps to form a basis for the understanding
of analysis of higher-order systems. The block diagram is
shown schematically in Figure 8. The closed-loop transfer
function of a second-order system with unity feedback can
be written as
