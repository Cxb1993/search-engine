Abstract—A closed-loop switched-capacitor-based (SC) two 
-stage current-mode multiphase voltage doubler (MPVD) is 
proposed based on pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control to 
achieve low-power step-up DC-DC conversion. The SC-based 
converter needs no magnetic element, e.g. inductor and 
transformer, so I.C. fabrication will be promising for VLSI 
applications. This current-mode MPVD can obtain the high 
voltage gain just by using the least number of pumping 
capacitors, so it will save the fabrication areas more. Besides, 
by combining with a current source and PWM control, a 
closed-loop MPVD is realized not only to enhance regulation 
capability for different desired outputs, but also to reinforce 
output robustness against source noises. Here, some theoretical 
analysis includes state-space averaging model, steady-state/ 
transient analysis, power efficiency, and system stability. 
Finally, the closed-loop current-mode MPVD is simulated by 
OrCAD, and the results are illustrated to show the efficacy of 
the proposed scheme. 
 
1. Introduction 
In general, a charge pump SC converter is designed to 
obtain an output voltage higher than times the supply voltage 
or a reverse-polarity voltage. In the last decade, the various 
types of charge pumps were suggested for power conversion, 
and the most famous topologies of them are both: Dickson 
[1-2] and Makowski [3-4]. Dickson charge pump is composed 
of a diode chain connected with two-phase clock via pumping 
capacitors. It can provide a step-up voltage gain proportional 
to the stage number of pumping capacitors [1]. But, it always 
requires the larger device area to implement VLSI when a 
larger voltage gain is asked. Makowski charge pump is 
composed of the two-phase cascaded voltage doublers [3]. By 
the two-phase clock for charge control, an n-stage Makowski 
charge pump can obtain the boosting voltage gain limited by 
the (n+1)th Fibinacci number. General speaking, these charge 
pumps have the larger rise time due to the cascaded scheme. 
But, on the other hand, they have the advantage of the lower 
voltage stress for each pumping capacitor than other SC 
converters do, so it is helpful to pumping capacitor fabrication. 
In addition, Makowski charge pump has been proved just to 
require the least number of pumping capacitors in the 
two-phase SC converters [4]. To follow this idea, Starzyk 
proposed a new charge pump scheme, called MPVD, and the 
most different point is to apply multiphase clocks for charge 
control [5]. By such a multiphase control, it is achieved that 
the voltage gain increases up to 2n at most in the n-stage 
MPVD. So, for the same voltage gain, the number of pumping 
capacitors in Starzyk is required fewer than that in Makowski, 
i.e., such a MPVD has the lower cost of fabrication area. 
Nevertheless, some improvement spaces still exist, e.g. 
regulation capability, and output robustness against source 
noises. Here, the idea of the current-mode SC converter [6] is 
adopted for charging capacitors via current source so as to 
improve the output robustness. Following the same idea, 
Chang also proposed an integrated scheme of SC step-down/ 
step-up DC-DC converter/DC-AC inverter [7-9]. In this paper, 
a closed-loop two-stage current-mode MPVD is proposed 
based on PWM for step-up DC-DC conversion. Based on the 
current-mode PWM, this MPVD possesses not only regulation 
capability for different output commands, but also output 
robustness against source noises/disturbances. 
2. Configuration of Current-mode MPVD 
    Fig.1 shows an overall closed-loop two-stage current- 
mode MPVD with PWM control, and it contains two major 
parts: “power part” and “control part”. The power part, called 
a current-mode MPVD step-up converter as shown in the 
upper half of Fig.1, is proposed based on two-stage Starzyk 
charge pump [5]. This modified MPVD is basically composed 
of two voltage doublers and one current source in series 
connection between source SV  and output oV . For more 
details, it includes 2 pumping capacitors 21, CC  & 8 switches 
4p1p1n S ,SS L , where each capacitor has the same capacitance 
C  ( CCC == 21 ) with equivalent series resistance (ESR) Cr , 
and similarly the output capacitor has capacitance oC  with 
ESR Cor , and 4p1p1n S ,SS L  are operated as static switches 
with the on-state resistance Tr . The basic operation of the 
modified MPVD is as follows. Fig.2 shows the theoretical 
waveforms of this current-mode MPVD. Here, one switching 
cycle ST  is divided into four quad- cycles with T  
( TTS 4= ). In the first quad-cycle (Phase I), let 1S  turn on 
(including 1pS , 1nS ), and then voltage 1Cv  across 1C  is 
charged up to SV . In the second quad-cycle (Phase II), let 
2S , 3S  turn on, and 2Cv  across 2C  is charged by the series 
connection with SV  and 1Cv . In the third quad-cycle (Phase 
III), it repeats the Phase I operation. In the forth quad-cycle 
(Phase VI), let 2S  and 4S  turn on, and under the series 
connection with SV , 1Cv , 2Cv , Cov  across oC  is charged 
via the current source DI  in the interval of ] [ 33 DTt,tt +∈  to 
supply the load LR . Based on the scheduled operation 
cyclically, output voltage ov  can be regulated relative to how 
long the charging time DT  is. Because of the two-stage 
scheme employed here, the step-up function can be realized so 
that the maximum output ov  can be boosted up to 4 times 
voltage of source SV  ideally. 
Secondly, the control part: PWM controller is used as 
shown in the lower half of Fig.1, which is functionally 
composed of low-pass filter (LPF), PWM block and phase 
generator. First, from the view of controller signal flow, the 
feedback output oi  is sent into LPF for high-frequency noise 
rejection. Next, the filtered signal oI  is compared with the 
desired output reference refI  so as to produce the duty cycle

For the better efficiency, the value of load LR  applied is 
supposed to be much larger than value of parasitic Tr , Cr . In 
fact, the value of load LR  is about in Ω -level, and the 
parasitic Tr , Cr  is about in Ωm -level. So, the dominant pole 
is 1p  as shown in (8b). It is obvious that the open-loop 
current-mode MPVD is locally stable because this dominant 
pole is located in the left half of s-plane. Furthermore, this 
dominant pole is not a function of static operating points, so it 
almost ensures the global stability of the open-loop 
current-mode MPVD. Thus, it is one of advantages that this 
MPVD scheme has an inherent good stability. 
 
3. Experiment of Current-mode MPVD 
    In this section, a closed-loop two-stage current-mode 
MPVD with PWM control is made in circuit layout and 
simulated by OrCAD tool, and then the results are illustrated 
to verify the efficacy of the proposed MPVD scheme. This 
MPVD is preparing to supply a WLED bank composed of 3 
WLEDs in series connection. Here, assume that the normal 
running voltage/current for each WLED is V3.3 / mA33 , so 
the nominal resistance of each WLED is about Ω100 . Thus, 
the total resistance of this bank is about Ω300  ( Ω= 300LR ). 
By such a series connection, it is sure to keep the running 
current identical so as to balance the brightness of each WLED. 
The brightness balance is very important for the back-light 
application. But, on the other hand, due to such a series 
scheme, this bank always needs the load voltage higher than 
the supply voltage, so a step-up converter is necessary. Here, 
according to Fig 1, a two-stage current-mode MPVD converter 
is employed for the boosting function of 4 times the supply 
voltage SV  at most. In addition, by using the current-mode 
duty-cycle adjustment of PWM, the output current can be 
regulated for the WLED brightness control. In the PWM block, 
the cut-off frequency Lw  is taken by 628rad/sec (100Hz) for 
high-frequency noise rejection, and the proportional gain PK  
is temporarily set on the value of 8. Furthermore, the current 
source DI  is chosen with the value of mA180 . 
    (i) Firstly, this MPVD is operated at the switching 
frequency of kHz20  to boost the output oV  being at most 4 
times the source SV  of V6.3  for supplying the WLED 
bank load LR  of Ω300 . Here, for the desired refI  of 
mA40 , the output current and the steady-state output voltage 
ripple are simulated, and their results are shown in Fig. 4. In 
Fig.4(a), it is obvious that the MPVD converter has a stable 
work on output conversion for the desired current, and the 
steady-state output oI  are conclusively about mA40  after 
the setting time of about ms30 . The output current oI  is 
sure to follow refI  via the current-mode PWM. In Fig. 4(b), 
the relative output ripple percentage is measured as: 
=Δ= oVovrp %237.0 , and the power efficiency is obtained 
as: =η %4.81 . These results show that the current-mode 
MPVD converter has a pretty good output conversion and 
steady-state performance.  
    (ii) Secondly, let’s look at the output robustness to source 
noises. Since the source voltage is decreasing naturally with 
the running time of battery, or varying due to the bad quality 
battery, the output robustness against source noises must be 
considered. In the first case, it is assumed that source SV  
starts at DC V6.3 , and then to have a exponential decrease at 
ms25  from V6.3  to V0.3 , as shown in the upper half of 
Fig.5. For the desired refI  of mA33 , the output current is 
simulated as shown in the lower half of Fig.5. Obviously, the 
steady-state oI  is still firmly following the desired refI  of 
mA33 , even though SV  has the disturbance of the 
exponential decaying voltage lower than standard source of 
V6.3 . In the second case, for the same desired refI , SV  is 
assumed to have the DC value of V6.3  and extra sinusoidal 
disturbance with peak V2.0 , as shown in the upper half of 
Fig.6. Then, the output current is obtained as shown in the 
lower half of Fig.6. Obviously, oI  is sure to follow refI  of 
mA33  in spite of the supply source with sinusoidal 
disturbance. So, these results show that the current-mode 
MPVD has the good output robustness to source variation or 
noise.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In general, a charge pump SC converter is designed to 
obtain an output voltage higher than times the supply voltage 
or a reverse-polarity voltage. In the last decade, the various 
types of charge pumps were suggested for power conversion, 
and the most famous topologies of them are both: Dickson [1-
2] and Makowski [3-4]. Dickson charge pump is composed of 
a diode chain connected with two-phase clock via pumping

to the stage number of pumping capacitors [1]. But, it always 
requires the larger device area to implement VLSI when a

composed of the two-phase cascaded voltage doublers [3]. By 
the two-phase clock for charge control, an n-stage Makowski 
charge pump can obtain the boosting voltage gain limited by 
the (n+1)th Fibinacci number. General speaking, these charge 
pumps have the larger rise time due to the cascaded scheme. 
But, on the other hand, they have the advantage of the lower 
voltage stress for each pumping capacitor than other SC 
converters do, so it is helpful to pumping capacitor fabrication. 
In addition, Makowski charge pump has been proved just to 
require the least number of pumping capacitors in the two-
phase SC converters [4]. To follow this idea, Starzyk proposed 
a new charge pump scheme, called MPVD, and the most 
different point is to apply multiphase clocks for charge control 
[5]. By such a multiphase control, it is achieved that the 
voltage gain increases up to 2n at most in the n-stage MPVD. 
So, for the same voltage gain, the number of pumping 
capacitors in Starzyk is required fewer than that in Makowski, 
i.e., such a MPVD has the lower cost of fabrication area. 
Nevertheless, some improvement spaces still exist, e.g. 
regulation capability, and output robustness against source 
noises. Here, the idea of the current-mode SC converter [6] is 
adopted for charging capacitors via current source so as to 
improve the output robustness. Following the same idea, 
Chang also proposed an integrated scheme of SC step-
down/step-up DC-DC converter/DC-AC inverter [7-9]. In this 
paper, a closed-loop two-stage current-mode MPVD is 
proposed based on PWM for step-up DC-DC conversion. 
Based on the current-mode PWM, this MPVD possesses not 
only regulation capability for different output commands, but 
also output robustness against source noises/disturbances. 
II. CONFIGURATION OF CURRENT-MODE MPVD 
Fig.1 shows an overall closed-loop two-stage current-
mode MPVD with PWM control, and it contains two major 
parts: “power part” and “control part”. The power part, called 
a current-mode MPVD step-up converter as shown in the 
upper half of Fig.1, is proposed and modified based on two-
stage Starzyk charge pump [5]. This modified MPVD is 
basically composed of two voltage doublers and one current 
source in series connection between source SV  and output oV . 
For more details, it includes 2 pumping capacitors 21, CC  & 8 
switches 4p1p1n S ,SS L , where each capacitor has the same 
capacitance C  ( CCC == 21 ) with equivalent series resistance 
(ESR) Cr , and similarly the output capacitor has capacitance 
oC  with ESR Cor , and 4p1p1n S ,SS L  are operated as static 
switches with the on-state resistance Tr . The basic operation 
of the modified MPVD is as follows. Fig.2 shows the 
theoretical waveforms of this current-mode MPVD. Here, one 
switching cycle ST  is divided into four quad-cycles with T  
( TTS 4= ). In the first quad-cycle (Phase I), let 1S  turn on 
(including PMOS 1pS  and NMOS 1nS ), and then voltage 1Cv  
 
(a) Phase I and III 
 
 
(b) Phase II 
 
(c)Phase VI 
Fig.3 Topologies of current-mode MPVD 
decreasing or LR  is varying, such a source/load variation 
does not affect oI  immediately. By reason of a constant 
current source DI  employed here, the source variation will 
not make immediate response on the output current. That is a 
very excellent advantage of current-mode scheme, so it could 
have the better output robustness against source variations. 
    Next, let’s look at the transient analysis. First, all variables 
need to be divided into two parts as: 
)(ˆV)( 11C1 tvtv CC += , )(ˆV)( 12C2 tvtv CC += , )(ˆV)( oC tvtv oCoC += , 
)(ˆV)( o tvtv oo += , )(ˆI)( S titi SS += , )(ˆD)( tdtD += , 
where D,I ,V ,V ,V ,V SooC2C1C  are static operating signals, 
and divvvv SooCCC
ˆ,ˆ ,ˆ ,ˆ ,ˆ ,ˆ 21  are dynamic small signals. Next, 
around some static operating point, by using the small-signal 
technique, a dynamic small-signal equation can be presented 
in (4), and consequently the transfer functions of current-
mode MPVD can be also suggested in (5).

For the better efficiency, the value of load LR  applied is 
supposed to be much larger than value of parasitic Tr , Cr . In 
fact, the value of load LR  is about in Ω -level, and the 
parasitic Tr , Cr  is about in Ωm -level. So, the dominant pole 
is 1p  as shown in (8b). It is obvious that the open-loop 
current-mode MPVD is locally stable because this dominant 
pole is located in the left half of s-plane. Furthermore, this 
dominant pole is not a function of static operating points, so it 
almost ensures the global stability of the open-loop current-
mode MPVD. Thus, it is one of advantages that this MPVD 
scheme has an inherent good stability. 
 
III. EXPERIMENT OF CURRENT-MODE MPVD 
    In this section, a closed-loop two-stage current-mode 
MPVD with PWM control is made in circuit layout and 
simulated by OrCAD tool, and then the results are illustrated 
to verify the efficacy of the proposed MPVD scheme. This 
MPVD is preparing to supply a WLED bank composed of 3 
WLEDs in series connection. Here, assume that the normal 
running voltage/current for each WLED is V3.3 / mA33 , so 
the nominal resistance of each WLED is about Ω100 . Thus, 
the total resistance of this bank is about Ω300  ( Ω= 300LR ). 
By such a series connection, it is sure to keep the running 
current identical so as to balance the brightness of each 
WLED. The brightness balance is very important for the 
back-light application. But, on the other hand, due to such a 
series scheme, this bank always needs the load voltage higher 
than the supply voltage, so a step-up converter is necessary. 
Here, according to Fig 1, a two-stage current-mode MPVD
