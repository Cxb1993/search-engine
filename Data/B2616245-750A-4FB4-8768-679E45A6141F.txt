This paper proposes a configuration shown in Fig.
1, which consists of only three simple and easilymade
elements that can generate a donutlike vortex beam
directly from the model of laser-diode (LD)-pumped
solid-state lasers by controlled Ince–Gaussian mode
(IGM) operation [27,28]. The resulting donutlike vor-
tex beam is the novel helical Ince–Gaussian mode
(HIGM) [29] arising from the mode conversion of
IGMs. This paper also analyzes the system’s toler-
ance to check the stability and feasibility of the pro-
posed donutlike laser beam generation mechanism.
The proposed three-lens configuration can generate a
very stable donutlike vortex beam by simply control-
ling the lateral off-axis position of the pump beam’s
focus on the laser crystal.
2. Basic Formalism and General FeatureTheory
A. Forced IGp,pe Mode Generation
The IGM is a predicted third complete family of solu-
tions of the paraxial wave equation (PWE) in elliptic
coordinate [29,30], except for two well-known trans-
verse lasing mode sets: Hermite–Gaussian modes
(HGMs) and Laguerre–Gaussianmodes (LGMs), which
are the exact and orthogonal solution sets of the PWE
in rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, respec-
tively. The IGMs propagating along the z axis of an
elliptic coordinate system of r  , , z with mode
number p and m and ellipticity  are given by [29]:
IGp,m
e r, Cw0wzCpmi, Cpm, expr2w2z
 exp ikz kr22Rz p 1zz, (1)
IGp,m
o r, Sw0wzSpmi, Spm, expr2w2z
 exp ikz kr22Rz p 1zz, (2)
where the elliptic coordinate is defined in a trans-
verse z plane as x  fz cos  cos , y  fz
sin  sin , and   0, 	,   0, 2
. fz is the
semifocal separation of IGMs, which is defined as the
width of the Gaussian beam, i.e., fz  f0wzw0,
where f0 and w0 are the semifocal separation and
the beam width at the z  0 plane, respectively.
wz  w01  z2zR2 12 describes the beam width,
zR  kw0
22 is the Rayleigh length, and k is the wave-
number of the beam. C and S are normalization con-
stants, subscripts e and o refer to even and odd IGMs,
respectively, and Cp
m .,  and Spm .,  are the even
and odd Ince polynomials [29] of order p, degree m,
and parameter , respectively. In Eqs. (1) and (2), r is
the radial distance from the central axis of the cavity,
Rz z zR2z is the radius of curvature of the phase
front and zz  arctanzzR. The parameters of
ellipticity , waist w0, and semifocal separation f0 are
not independent but related by   2f0
2w02. The pat-
terns of IGMs could be recognized by the rules that
degree m corresponds to the number of hyperbolic
nodal lines and p  m2 is the number of elliptic
nodal lines. Figure 2 plots some analytic patterns of
the IGp,m modes.
Researchers recently experimentally observed
IGMs in an LD-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser by breaking
the resonator symmetry, which is done by shifting a
concave output coupler slightly sideways perpen-
dicular to the pump direction by several tens of
micrometers [27] or by adjusting the azimuthal sym-
metry of the short laser resonator [28]. Both ap-
proaches introduce a degree of “off-axis pumping,”
which controls the relative gain size and gain position
in the cavity. It thus appears to govern the operation
IGM that is most efficiently pumped by a tight beam
focus. While studying how to force IGM operation in
LD-pumped solid-state lasers, we discover a way to
force IGp,p
e modes in an LD-pumped solid-state laser
system. As Fig. 3(a) indicates, IGp,p
e mode operation
can be achieved by controlling the size and lateral
position of the pump beam’s focus such that both
values match those of the outside lobes of desired
IGp,p
e modes at the position of the laser crystal in a
laser cavity. Figure 3(a) also shows how the pumping
beam influences the resulting IGp,p
e mode, where the
relative gain region (black circle) and the resulting
IG5,5
e mode patterns are obtained by the simulation
code described in Section 3. Figure 3(b) shows the
corresponding analytical patterns to those in Eq. (1).
These figures show that the ellipticity  of the result-
ing IGp,p
e modes from an off-axis end-side LD-pumped

The HIGM, HIGp,m
 is constructed of the form [29]:
HIGp,m
  IGp,m
e  i IGp,m
o . (8)
The phase of this HIGM rotates elliptically, and the
sign of i in Eq. (8) defines the rotation direction. Fig-
ure 4(a) depicts the construction of HIG1,1
 by mode
superposition. The phase of the HIG1,1
 mode rotates
circularly because of its circular symmetric field dis-
tribution. The process of the mode conversion is ex-
plained as follows: Eq. (8) shows that the generated
HIG1,1
 mode is a combination of an IG1,1
e mode and an
IG1,1
o mode with a relative phase,   
2. The equiv-
alence property in Eqs. (6) and (7) means that the
HIG1,1
 mode can be treated as the combination of an
IG1,1
e LG0,1e HG10 mode and an IG1,1o LG0,1o HG01 mode
with a relative phase 
2.
As Fig. 1 shows, the laser cavity was designed to be
a concave–convex type, ensuring that the wavefront
of the selected tilted IG1,1
e LG0,1e HG10 mode will be of
a converged form after transmitting through the S-C
lens, which accompanies the curvature design of two
cylinder surfaces to smooth away the two crucial
mode-matching requirements of an AMC. That is: (1)
the waist of the astigmatic IG1,1
e LG0,1e HG10 mode
and IG1,1
o LG0,1o HG01 mode must coincide at the cen-
ter of the two cylinder surfaces and (2) the two trans-
verse radii of the astigmatic beam must be equal at
the two cylinder surfaces [32].
As Fig. 1 shows, the off-axis direction of the pump-
ing beam is at 45° with respect to the horizontal axis
(i.e., the axis of the two cylindrical surfaces) to gen-
erate the lasing IG1,1
e mode whose principal axis has
an orientation at 45° with respect to the axes of
the two cylinder surfaces. The selected tilted
IG1,1
e LG0,1e HG10 mode from the concave–convex la-
ser cavity can be treated as the superposition of
an IG1,1
e LG0,1e HG10 mode and an IG1,1o LG0,1o HG01
mode, as Fig. 4(b) illustrates. While passing through
the first cylinder surface, the two nonastigmatic
HGMs are transformed into astigmatic modes. The
Gouy phase of astigmatic HGMs, HGnx,ny [33], is
nx 12xz ny 12yz, (9)
with
xz arctanz zoxzRx, (10)
yz arctanz zoyzRy, (11)
where zox and zoy are the position of the waist and zRx
and zRy are the corresponding Rayleigh lengths of
each transverse direction. Since the Gouy phases of
the two decomposed astigmatic modes, the HG1,0
mode and an HG0,1 mode, are different functions of
the propagation distance z, a relative phase,  

2, can be introduced by propagating two astig-
matic modes through a distance of 2l0 between two
cylindrical surfaces, which satisfies
2arctanl0zRx arctanl0zRy 
2. (12)
The second cylinder lens then changes the two
astigmatic modes into nonastigmatic modes: IG1,1
e 
LG0,1
e HG10 and IG1,1o LG0,1o HG01 with a 
2 rela-
tive phase embedded. This superposition thus forms
an HIG1,1
 mode. Note that the shape of the two cy-
lindrical surfaces determines the phase rotation di-
rection of HIG1,1
 , i.e., the sign of the introduced

 mode and (b) the tilted IG1,1
e mode.

laser gain medium, such as a 1 mm thick a-plate
Nd:YAG crystal, is assumed to be situated near the
back mirror at a distance of 14 times the length of
cavity length L. The LD pumping source with a wave-
length of 808 nm is focused on the gain medium from
the left side of the concave mirror. The lasing wave-
length  is selected to be the lasing wavelength of the
Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm, which is commonly used in
biosample manipulation. The lens index of fused
quartz at lasing wavelength n is 1.449, and the dis-
tance between the two spherical surfaces L is arbi-
trarily set at 15 cm. The corresponding system
parameters are as follows: the radius of the concave
mirror R1 is 40.21 cm, the radius of the spherical
surface of the S-C lens R2 is 28.10 cm, the radius of
each cylinder surface R3 is 10.18 cm, the half dis-
tance between the two cylinder surfaces l0 is 16.04
cm, and the thickness of the S-C lens t is 5.0 mm.
In simulation, while the gain volumewas located at
the central axis of the cavity, i.e., lasing axis, the
converged lasing pattern after iterations was the
HG00 mode. However, when the gain volume corre-
sponding to the circular pumping beam focus with
lateral dimension d of the half spot size of the fun-
damental HG00 mode of the laser cavity, 578 m, was
shifted r 0.409 mm laterally to the peak position of
IG1,1
e mode, as the inset of Fig. 1 shows, a tilted IG1,1
e
mode operation was established after 580 iterations
starting from a random initial pattern, which was
demonstrated in Fig. 5. When the laser pattern con-
verges to a steady pattern, the internal power also
converges to a steady value. The relative internal
power is defined as the ratio of transient state inter-
nal power to the final state internal power. The mode
convergence condition in simulations, i.e., the condi-
tion that the optical field stops propagating back and
forth in the cavity, was set as the last five internal
power variations are all smaller than 0.01% of their
average. Figure 6 shows the simulation results of the

We also check the system’s tolerance of errors in
the off-axis distance of the pumping beam, r. While
75 m  r  150 m, the MP of all resulting
HIG1,1
 modes are all greater than 99.95%. However,
while the r is out of the range, the selected tilted
IGp,p
e mode converges to the adjacent-order modes of
IG1,1
e mode, IG2,2
e , and IG0,0
e mode. The tolerance of the
r is40% of the beamwaist spot size at the position
of the laser crystal, w.
5. Conclusion
In summary, this study proposes a three-lens system
consisting of only three simple and easily made ele-
ments, which can directly generate a stable donutlike
vortex laser beam, theHIG1,1
 mode, from laser-diode-
pumped solid-state lasers by simply controlling the
lateral off-axis position of the pump beam’s focus on
the laser crystal. The system’s performance degrada-
tion versus all system error is checked by numerical
analyses to ensure system stability and feasibility.
The proposed system is sensitive only to decenter
error between the concave mirror and the S-C lens.
However, even when the decenter error between the
concave mirror and the S-C lens reaches 5 m, the
resonator is still able to generate a beam with a high
mode purity of 99%. With such a stable beam qual-
ity, the generated donutlike vortex beam, with null
intensity at the beam axis and carrying an orbital
angularmomentum, is beneficial to a number of stud-
ies [13–17]. Moreover, simply adding a Q switch in-
side the resonator allows the proposed structure to
function in Q-switched operation, producing a pulsed
donutlike vortex beam. With some further modifica-
tion, the proposed structure can generate the novel
coherent white-light donut shape supercontinuum
[47]. Details on this topic will be presented in the
near future.
