1Abstract—Constructions of multi-block space-time cod-
ing schemes that are optimal with respect to the diversity-
multiplexing tradeoff when coding is applied over any
number of independent fading blocks are presented in
this paper. The constructions are based on the left-regular
representation of elements of some cyclic division algebra.
In particular, the main construction applies to the case
when the quasi-static fading interval equals the number
of transmit antennas, and the resultant scheme is termed
minimal delay multi-block space-time coding scheme. Vari-
ations of this construction corresponding to the cases of
non-minimal delay are also provided. As the number of
coded blocks approaches infinity, coding schemes derived
from the proposed constructions can be used to provide
a reliable MIMO communication with vanishing error
probability.
I. INTRODUCTION
By deploying multiple antennas at both trans-
mitter and receiver ends, the MIMO (multiple-
input-multiple-output) technology has significantly
increased the ergodic channel capacity as well as
the reliability of communication link. Consider a
MIMO communication system with nt transmit and
nr receive antennas. Under the quasi-static MIMO
Rayleigh block fading channel model, let T denote
the quasi-static interval. A (nt × mT ) multi-block
space-time code X is a collection of (nt × mT )
matrices for sending coded information over m
fading blocks, meaning mT channel uses in all. The
code X then transmits on the average
R :=
1
mT
log2 |X | (1)
bits per channel use. Let r denote the normalized
rate of X , also known as the multiplexing gain [1],
given by
r :=
R
log2 SNR
, (2)
or equivalently, |X | = SNRrmT . It is shown in
[1] that the maximum achievable multiplexing gain
equals min{nt, nr} at high SNR regime.
In view of the fact that one should be able to trade
transmission rate for error performance, recently,
Zheng and Tse showed in [1] that there exists
a fundamental tradeoff between the multiplexing
and the diversity gain, referred to as the diversity-
multiplexing (D-M) tradeoff. The D-M tradeoff
asserts that the minimal possible codeword error
probability Pe that can be achieved by any (nt ×
mT ) multi-block space-time coding schemes with
multiplexing gain r is on the order of
Pe
.

∗(r), (3)
where by .= we mean the exponential equality de-
fined in [1]; we say the function f(SNR) .= SNRb
if and only if
lim
SNR→∞
log f(SNR)
logSNR
= b, (4)
and the notations of ≥˙ and ≤˙ are defined in a similar
fashion. The negative exponent d∗(r) is referred to
as the maximum achievable diversity gain. For the
case when T ≥ nt + nr − 1, the values of d∗(r) are
given by a piecewise linear function connecting the
points (k, d∗(k)), k = 0, 1, · · · ,min{nt, nr}, where
d∗(k) = m (nt − k) (nr − k) . (5)
On the other hand, if T < nt + nr − 1, both upper
and lower bounds on d∗(r) are available in [1].
This remarkable result has spurred a considerable
amount of research activities on constructing space-
time coding schemes to achieve this optimal tradeoff
(5). Much recent progress has been made in the case
ofm = 1. To name a few, in [2], [3] the authors have
provided a (2×2) D-M optimal construction, termed
the “Golden code.” By generalizing the Golden
code construction, Oggier et al. provided in [4] the
constructions of (3×3), (4×4), and (5×5) perfect
space-time codes. El Gamal, Caire, and Damen [5]
provided a construction of (nt×T ) coding schemes,
termed LAST (lattice space-time) codes which are
optimal for all T ≥ nr + nr − 1 with m = 1.
Kiran and Sundar Rajan [6] proposed a (nt × nt)
construction of space-time codes obtained from a
cyclic division algebra for the cases when nt = 2n,
3 · 2n, or 3n for some positive integer n. Such
construction is D-M optimal shown by Elia et al.
in [7]. In particular, the authors in [7] provided
an optimal (nt × nt) construction of space-time
codes for all nt ≥ 1. Furthermore, in [8] Tavildar
and Viswanath provided another criterion, termed
approximately university, for examining the tradeoff
performance of space-time coding schemes.
It should be noted that while all the above
constructions are optimal with respect to the D-
M tradeoff, none of them is capable of providing
a reliable MIMO communication due to the non-
vanishing error probability. In other words, the

Fig. 1. The two number fields L and K required for constructing
the minimal delay multi-block space-time coding schemes. The map
id is the identity automorphism. D is the cyclic division algebra of
L over K.
and the number field K is a subfield of L having
degree of extension m over Q(ı). In both [7] and
[10] the authors have provided several systematic
methods for constructing such number fields L and
K.
Bearing with the above in mind, let σ be the
generator of the Galois group of L over Q(ı)
Gal (L/Q(ı)) = 〈σ〉 (12)
and it is clear that σ has order n. Since Gal (L/Q(ı))
is cyclic, the Galois group Gal (L/K) for L over
K is also a cyclic group generated by σm whose
order equals nt. Therefore, L is cyclic Galois over
K as well and its degree of extension equals nt. The
Galois group for K over Q(ı) is the quotient group
Gal(K/Q(ı)) = 〈σ〉 / 〈σm〉
=
{
σi : i = 0, · · · ,m− 1} .(13)
It then follows that D = (L/K, ζ = σm, γ) is a
cyclic division algebra for some non-norm element
γ ∈ K. Moreover, the cyclic division algebra D can
be embedded in a (nt × nt) matrix algebra over L
through left-regular representations of elements in
D and it has been shown [7], [9] that every such
(nt × nt) matrix has determinant in K.
For construction, we will choose γ from Z[ı] and
the reason will soon become clear. Let X˜ be a (nt×
nt) space-time coding scheme defined as
X˜ :=

, (14)
where
B := {e1, e2, · · · , en} (15)
is an integral basis for L over Q(ı). Then the
proposed (nt×mnt) multi-block space-time coding
scheme X is given by
X :=
{
X =
(
X˜, σ(X˜), · · · , σm−1(X˜)
)
: X˜ ∈ X˜
}
. (16)
Namely, if X˜ was the code matrix chosen from
X˜ for transmission, then the transmitter actually
sends σi(X˜) during the ith fading block, i =
0, 1, · · · , (m − 1), where we recall that σ is the
generator of the Galois group Gal(L/Q(ı)). One
direct consequence of the above construction is the
following.
Proposition 1: Let X˜ and X be defined
as above; then for every nonzero codeword
(X0, · · · , Xm−1) ∈ X , we have∣∣∣∣∣
m−1∏
i=0
det (Xi)
∣∣∣∣∣ ≥ 1. (17)
Proof: Firstly, note that (X0, · · · , Xm−1) =(
X˜, σ(X˜), · · · , σm−1(X˜)
)
for some nonzero X˜ ∈
X˜ . As the non-norm element γ lies in Z[ı], the
entries of X˜ are in OL, the ring of algebraic integers
in L, i.e. the integral closure of Z in L. It then
follows from [9] that
0 6= det(X˜) ∈ OK ,
where OK is the ring of algebraic integers in K.
Now the proof is completed by noting
m−1∏

det (Xi) =

(

where NK/Q(ı)(a) denotes the algebraic norm of a
from K to Q(ı).
The above property should be regarded as the gen-
eralized non-vanishing determinant property [6]. To
see this, setting m = 1 in Proposition 1 yields
|det(X)| ≥ 1
5And by † we mean the operation of the Hermitian
transpose of a matrix.
Without loss of generality we may assume
λi,1 ≤ λi,2 ≤ · · · ≤ λi,nt , and (21)
`i,1 ≥ `i,2 ≥ · · · ≥ `i,nt . (22)
Now invoking the mismatched bound in Theorem 4
in Appendix yields
d2E(X,X
′) ≥ θ2

Moreover, we may re-order and re-index the values
(λ0,1, · · · , λ0,nt , · · · , λm−1,nt) as a non-decreasing
sequence λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn, and similarly
(`0,1, · · · , `0,nt , · · · , `m−1,nt) as a non-increasing se-
quence `1 ≥ `2 ≥ · · · ≥ `n, where n = mnt.
Now with the above re-ordering d2E(X,X
′) can be
further lower bounded by

(24)
for k = 1, 2, · · · , n, where the last inequality fol-
lows from the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality.
In particular, by making use of Proposition 1 and
again by the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality,
the serial-product of `i can be lower bounded by

where the first inequality follows from Proposition
1. As λ1 > 0 with probability 1, define
αi := − logSNR λi, (26)
α := [α1, · · · , αn]t; (27)
then substituting (25) into (24) yields

for k = 1, 2, · · · , n. Thus, given α = [α1, · · · , αn]t,
the corresponding codeword error probability can be

and it is clear that

φk (α) := φ (α) . (31)
Let p (α) denote the joint probability density func-
tion for α and let 1, 2 be scalars satisfying 0 <
1, 2  1; then for k = 1, 2, · · · , n, we have the

where by α > −1 we mean αi > −1 for all
i, and where δ (α) := [δ1(α) · · · δn(α)]t. The last
inequality in (32) follows from that φk (α) is a
monotonically decreasing function in δk (α) and that
φk (α) ≤ 1.
In particular, the first summand in (32) represents
the case of a deeply faded channel that results
in a poor signal distance; the second summand
corresponds to the case when a deeply faded channel
but still resulting in a good signal distance; the
third summand addresses the case of having a good
channel.
To estimate the upper bound (32) we require
the knowledge of p(α). Recall that the eigenvalues
