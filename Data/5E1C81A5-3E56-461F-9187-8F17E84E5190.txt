When the robot is controlled to drive on 
a reference path, it usually has some 
state-following errors. The state-tracking 
errors [ ]Tyx eeee θ=  expressed in the 
frame of a real robot and a virtual reference

Abstract 
In this paper, the design of chaotic cryptosystems 
with time-delay has been presented. The cryptosystem is 
composed of cryptograph and chaotic signals. Two 
time-delay chaotic signals are synchronized by the design 
of fuzzy observer. This observer gains achieve asymptotic 
synchronization when the encrypter and decryper start 
from different initial conditions. The LMI (linear matrix 
inequality) condition is derived to guarantee the global 
stability of the time-delay cryptosystem with disturbance 
rejection. Computer simulation demonstrates that the 
time-delay cryptosystem owns robust performance. 
Keywords：T-S fuzzy model, linear matrix inequality, 
time-delay chaotic cryptosystems. 
  
1. Introduction 
Since the internet and mobile phone are 
worldwide, synchronization of chaotic system and its 
application to secure communication for chaos-based 
cryptosystems have attracted much attention [1]-[5]. 
Chaotic systems are situated between deterministic 
systems and stochastic systems. The pioneering work 
of Carroll and Pecora [6] has led to many works 
regarding synchronization of two chaotic systems 
[7]-[9]. There are a lot of researches in investigating 
chaos-based secure communications. Various methods 
have been developed in order to hide the texts of the 
message using chaotic signals, for examples, chaotic 
switching [10]-[11], chaotic modulation [12]-[13], and 
chaotic masking [14]-[15]. In this paper, the 
Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is proposed for 
chaotic synchronization.  
Recently, the applications of fuzzy theorems are 
rapidly growing in industries. Takagi and Sugeno 
proposed a fuzzy model to represent a nonlinear 
system [16]. It has been recognized as a popular and 
powerful tool in approximating a complex nonlinear 
system. This approach has been extended to deal with 
nonlinear systems with time-delay [17]-[18]. In this 
paper, the T-S fuzzy model is obtained by using local 
approximation in fuzzy partition spaces. Herein, the 
Lorenz’s equation is represented as the T-S fuzzy 
model via choosing linear terms. 
An observer is designed to achieve the chaos 
synchronization between the transmitter and the 
receiver. In the observer scheme, each control rule is 
designed from the corresponding rule of the T-S fuzzy 
model. The observer shares the same fuzzy sets with 
the fuzzy model in the premise parts. The LMI 
approach is applied to design the observer gains. The 
LMI stability conditions are derived from the 
Laypunov stability theorem. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 presents the time-delay chaotic 
cryptosystems based on T-S fuzzy model. Section 3 
provides numerical experiments and computer 
simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
design. Section 4 gives the conclusions. 
 
2. LMI Stabilization Condition of 
Time-Delay Chaotic Cryptosystems 
 It is important to select an appropriate model to 
represent a real plant in system analysis and design. 
This paper utilizes the LMI-based fuzzy techniques to 
design chaotic cryptosystems. We represent the 
chaotic system as a T-S fuzzy model with time-delay. 
The T-S fuzzy model emanated from Takagi and 
Sugeno. It is described by fuzzy IF-THEN rules that 
describe input-output relations of a nonlinear system. 
The main feature of a T-S fuzzy model is to express 
the local dynamics of each fuzzy implication by a 
linear subsystem model. The T-S fuzzy model is 
achieved by fuzzy blending of the linear subsystem 
models. 
In this paper, we proposed a robust fuzzy 
observer to synchronize the internal states of the 
encrypter-decrypter pair system. Fig. 1 shows the 
structure of time-delay chaos-based cryptosystem. It 
consists of the encrypter (the drive chaotic system and 
an encryption function) and decrypter (the response

))(()( 22 txKtK r=                (8) 
 
Part 4: By taking the drive chaotic system (1), the 
cipher signal (5), and the key signal (7), we have 
obtained the fuzzy encrypter by the following rules: 
 
Encrypter model rule i: IF )(tyd  is iM , THEN 
)()()()()( tvDtELtxAtxAtx inididid ++−+= ττ&  
ritEtxCtxCty nddd ,,2,1),()()()( K=+−+= ττ  
(9) 
 
where )(tyd  is the transmitted signal which 
embedded in the cipher signal En (t). The overall fuzzy 
encrypter can be inferred as

(10) 
)()()()( tEtxCtxCty nddd +−+= ττ            (11) 
 
It is necessary to generate the key signal at the 
response chaotic system for the retrieve of the plaint 
signal. That is, the synchronization between the 
encrypter and the decrypter must be guaranteed. In 
this paper, the decrypter is derived from the fuzzy 
observer design. Therefore, the fifth part of the design 
framework is the following. 
Part 5: Given the response chaotic system (3) and the 
encrypter (9), the fuzzy decrypter can be obtained by 
the following rules. 
 
Decrypter model rule i: IF )(tyd  is iM , THEN 
))()(()()()( tytyLtxAtxAtx rdiririr −−+= ττ&  
ritxCtxCty rrr ,,2,1),()()( K=−+= ττ      (12)

Hence, the recovered cipher signal is obtained 
  
          )()()( tytytE rdn −=              (15) 
  
Define the error signal as )()()( txtxte rd −= . 
Taking the previous considerations into account, the 
decrypter (12) has to be designed such that state 
)(txr  converges to state )(txd  as ∞→t . These 
two time-delay chaotic systems are synchronized 
between the encrypter and decrypter, that is, 
0)( →te  as ∞→t . The decrypter (12) could be 
treated as an observer of encrypter (9). Since 
)()()( txtxte rd −=  and form (10) and (13), then the 
following equation can be obtained:

By exploiting the LMI theory, the following 
theorem presents a fuzzy observer design for 
disturbance rejection of the T-S fuzzy model with 
time-delay. 
Proposition 1:  Consider the error dynamics system 
(16) and the error of the cipher signal (17), the 
disturbance rejection can be realized by minimizing
