Abstract 
 
A smart antenna adopts the beamforming technique to increase the 
signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and system capacity. In this paper, the impacts of 
two channel estimation errors: Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) estimation error and 
Multiple Access Interference (MAI) estimation error for the beamforming of a W-CDMA 
smart antenna are analyzed by using the measured channel state information (CSI). Results 
show that with Complex Conjugate (CC) beamforming, FDD estimation error will cause less 
than 1dB degradation of the desired signal in the LOS channel and 1dB~3dB in NLOS 
channel. And the MAI estimation error will cause 0.3dB~0.5dB degradation per interference 
if the desired signal is in the LOS case and 0.5dB~1dB degradation in the NLOS case. 
 
 
Line-Of-Sight (LOS) case and the other is Non-
LOS (NLOS) case. Finally, some conclusions of 
this paper are given in Section IV.. 
 
2. DEGRADATION ANALYSIS 
 
A conventional smart antenna can be depicted 
in Fig.1. Assume there are M antenna elements at 
the receiving site, each element can multiply an 
appropriate weighting iw  to compensate the 
channel distortion. With these weightings, smart 
antenna can coherently sum up these output 
signals to increase SNR.

(a). FDD Estimation Error 
Consider the FDD case, a P -paths uplink time-
invariant channel for the thk −  user at the thm −  
receiving antenna can be modeled as 
)()( ,,

0
,,, kmp
P
p
kmpkm tUtU τδ −=∑−
=
 (1) 
where kmpU ,,  is the complex uplink channel 
attenuation at time kmp ,,τ . kmp ,,τ  is the time-of-
arrival (TOA) of the thp −  multipath at the thm −  
receiving antenna for the thk −  user. Assume the 
instantaneous downlink channel for the thk −  user 
has the same TOAs but different attenuations 
compared with the uplink channel. Therefore, the 
corresponding downlink channel model for the 
thk −  user can be expressed as 
)()( ,,

p
kmpkm tDtD τδ −=∑−

 (2) 
where kmpD ,,  is the complex downlink attenuation. 
In FDD, kmpU ,,  and kmpD ,,  will be quite different 
due to the adoption of different frequency bands. 
If we define the normalized frequency correlation 
function as 
Ω
Δ+=Δ )()()(
* kkHkHkρ           (3) 
where )(kH is the channel frequency response, }{ 2)(kHE=Ω ,  kΔ  is the frequency offset and {.}E  
is the expectation operator. Two correlation 
examples for the measured LOS and NLOS paths 
are illustrated in Fig.3 and Fig.4. Both illustrate 
the relation between the correlation function 
defined in Eq.(3) versus frequency difference 
between the uplink and downlink channels. 
Results show that for a given correlation 
coefficient (take 5.0=ρ  as example), coherent 
bandwidth for the outdoor environment is less 
than 200KHz. That is, for uplink and downlink 
channels with frequency difference large than 
200KHz, they can be treated as uncorrelated ones 
in this measure environment.

results of signal degradation for the LOS and 
NLOS cases. We can notice that signal has less 
degradation in the LOS case (less than 1dB in 
average) than in the NLOS case (1dB to 3dB in 
average). And the degradation increases as the 
distance between Tx-Rx increases. 
In order to evaluate the impact of MAI 
interferences, we synthesized MAI scenario as 
followed: the MAI users were randomly 
distributed along Path-1, Path-5 and Path-8. That 
is, interferences may have LOS or NLOS paths to 
the receiver. The desired user was moving along 
Path-2 for the LOS case and Path-6 for the NOLS 
cases. The number of MAI interference sources is 
given from 1 to 9. Fig.7 and Fig .8 are the results 
if we compare the beamforming degradation in a 
MAI scenario for the LOS and NLOS cases 
respectively. Same phenomenon occurs compared 
with the FDD estimation error, LOS case has less 
system degradation (0.5dB to 2dB in average) 
than the NLOS case (1dB to 4dB in average). A 
rule-of-thumb result reveals from the experiments 
that system will suffer about 0.3dB~0.5dB 
degradation per interference in the LOS case and 
0.5dB~1dB degradation in the NLOS case. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this paper, the beamforming degradation of 
a smart antenna with FDD and MAI estimation 
errors are investigated. Results show that FDD 
estimation error will cause less than 1dB 
degradation for the desired signal in the LOS 
channel and 1dB~3dB in the NLOS channel. And 
the MAI interference will cause 0.3dB~0.5dB 
degradation per interference for the LOS user and 
0.5dB ~1dB degradation for the NLOS user. With 
this rule-of-thumb result, a W-CDMA smart 
antenna system can be built and operated with its 
anticipated signal quality performance.

different scenarios; the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) case and the Non-
LOS (NLOS) case; to illustrate the derived results and 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

2. DERIVATIONS 
A simple 2-Tx antennas/ 1-Rx antenna STBC-RAKE receiver 
scenario can be illustrated in Fig. 1. In this structure, two different 
signals ( 1x  and 2x ) can be transmitted simultaneously using two 
transmitting antennas with one receiving antenna. For clearness, 
signal processing of 1x  and 2x  are illustrated separately in Fig. 
1(a) and Fig. 1(b). They are of the same architecture with 
different signal combining coefficients. Assume that a P -paths 
time-invariant channel for the kth  Tx-Rx antenna pair can be 
modeled as

where kph ,  is the attenuation at time kp,τ . kp,τ  is the time-of-

the symbol period. Consider the case if there is not any AWGN 
noise kn or MAI interference ki during transmission 
( 2,1,0 === kin kk ) and assume that quasi-static channel 
can be achieved (i.e. 2,1),()( ,, =+= kthth skpkp τ ). The 
received signal of pth  finger for the first and second symbol 
1,py  and 2,py  can be expressed as

Hence, 1x  and 2x  can be estimated directly from the output 
signals 1xˆ  and 2xˆ  respectively.  
In a W-CDMA system, let the dedicated physical control 
channel (DPCCH) and the dedicated physical data channel 
(DPDCH) of the two transmitting signals 1x  and 2x  have the 
same spreading factor cF  and dF  respectively. Consider the 
scenario that MAI and AWGN exist, the kth  channel, pth  
finger output signals kpcy ,, , kpdy ,,  of DPCCH and DPDCH

Assume that the DPCCH and DPDCH have the same 
channel characteristics during transmission, and we perform the 
channel estimation via the use of the pilot symbols at the DPCCH 
[2]. Thus, DPDCH output signals for 1x  and 2x  of the P -

that system performance will be degraded dramatically if channel

Based on the criterion that the received SINR of the STBC-
RAKE receiver with 1+P  fingers should be greater than that 
with P  fingers, (i.e., PP SINRSINR 1

simple and analytic counter measure to improve system 
performance with imperfect channel estimation can be derived.

Compare Equ.(14) with Equ.(17), we can note that when there 
is no channel estimation error, the SINR of the STBC-RAKE 
receiver will always increase as the number of the adopted finger 
increases. But when there is some channel estimation error caused 
by the MAI and AWGN noise, the STBC-RAKE receiver can 
improve performance according to the rule in Equ.(17) to have a 
better SINR. That is, STBC-RAKE receiver should dynamically 
adjust its finger number in accordance with the change of the Tx-
Rx multipath surrounding. The operations of the proposed 
dynamic finger SINR improvement method for the STBC-RAKE 
receiver can be illustrated in Fig. 2. 
3. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, we will use the measured CSI to see the 
performance degradation of the STBC-RAKE receiver with 
channel estimation error. Besides, we will also present the SINR 
improvement if the STBC-RAKE receiver adopts the proposed 
dynamic finger STBC-RAKE receiver derived in Section II. CSI 
was measured by using the RUSK channel sounder. We used two 
transmitting antennas and one receiving antenna to conduct this 
experiment. Spacing between the two transmitting antennas is 
λ2 , λ  is the wavelength and the operating center frequency is 
2.44GHz. 5MHz bandwidth was measured to satisfy the W-
CDMA requirement [2]. Fig. 3 shows the layout of the campus of 
National Taiwan University and the traveling paths of the mobile 
are shown. The receiver was placed on the top of an 11 floors 
building and was marked as Rx in the figure. In Fig. 3, Path-7 is 
assumed to be the LOS case and Path-A is the NLOS case. 400 
delay profiles were measured along each path for the statistical 
analysis. The synthesized MAI measurement scenario is as 
followed. The desired user is moving along Path-7 for the LOS 
case and Path-A for the NLOS case. Other MAI interference 
sources are randomly distributed along Path-5, Path-6 and Path-7. 
Total number of interference sources is 10 and each delay profile 
is randomly selected from the measured delay profile on Path-5, 
Path-6 and Path-7. For simplicity, the spreading factors of the 
DPCCH and DPDCH ( cF , dF ) are set to 256 and 64 
respectively for all users. 12 =nσ  for all cases. 
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are the corresponding SINR experimental 
results for the LOS and NLOS cases respectively. Both illustrate 
the cumulative distribution probability (CDF) of the measured 
SINR for the STBC-RAKE receiver along each path. The finger 
number of the STBC-RAKE receiver is set to 6 and the proposed 
dynamic finger method can vary its finger number from 1 to 6. In 
the perfect channel estimation case, we measure the delay profile 
of the desired user and calculated its SINR using Equ.(14). In the 
imperfect case, we calculated the SINR under the synthesized 
MAI measurement scenario. It shows that the STBC-RAKE 
system will suffer a great degradation with the imperfect channel 
error (about 10dB in the mean sense). Besides, with the help of 
the proposed dynamic finger method, system will have better 
SINR improvement on both the NLOS and LOS cases. Note that 
an interesting result is shown on both the Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, it 
shows that with the help of dynamic finger method, the received 
SINR can even better than the fixed finger STBC-RAKE receiver 
with perfect channel estimation (AWGN only). This is because 
not all added signals on the RAKE fingers will have effective 
SINR contribution in a real practice. That is, if the added fingers 
do not satisfy the requirement of Equ.(17), they will degrade the 
receiver performance on the contrary. And the proposed dynamic 
finger number can avoid this situation compare with the fixed 
finger architecture. 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we derive the system degradation of the STBC-
RAKE receiver with channel estimation error and proposed a 
simple analytic dynamic finger method to improve its SINR. We 
used the measured CSI to see the system degradation and verify 
the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic finger STBC-RAKE. 
Simulation results have shown that the STBC-RAKE system will 
suffer a great degradation with the imperfect channel estimation 
and the proposed method will have a satisfactory SINR 
improvement for the W-CDMA system if channel estimation error 
exists. Since the proposed dynamic finger method is very simple, 
it can be implemented easily in the 3G W-CDMA system.

Intuitively, the weightings are to compensate the 
attenuation caused by the wireless channel. Therefore, receiver 
can add the compensated signals of each element to detect the 
transmitted symbol. CC method multiplies the complex 
conjugate of the DPCCH channel estimation to maximize the 
SINR. CC method has the advantage of simple calculation 
complexity and has the same operation as Maximum Ratio 
Combining (MRC) method which is the optimal diversity 
combining technique. 
(b). DOA (Direction-of-Arrival) Beamforming 
Compared with the CC method, DOA method uses another 
estimated signal parameter DOA to decide the weightings ijw . 
Due to the phase difference relation of the received signal and 
the geometry of antenna array (a linear equal space antenna 
array with half-wavelength separation is considered in this 
paper), weighting ijw  can be determined by Eq.(2)

where  i = 1 ~ M , j = 1 ~ P。 *11 )(ˆ jj hw τ= , λ  is the 
wavelength. 
In DOA method, channel compensation can be achieved 
by the phase relation of the incident multipath signals. Once 
the attenuated signals are compensated, signals of different 
antennas are added to decide the transmitted symbol.  
Besides, a P-paths time-invariant channel for the kth  user

The SINR for the P-fingers CC RAKE receiver at the DPDCH 
is given by 
achieved. It reveals that both CC and DOA methods will have 
the same mean SINR performance statistically. However, CC 
method will be more robust compare with the DOA method 
since that it has less variance ( 44 σMP  in CC case and 
424 σPM  in the DOA case). And if more antennas are 
adopted at the receiving site, this variance will become more 
significant. The same phenomenon occurs for the CC and 
DOA method as in Eq.(12) and Eq.(18) when the channel 
estimation contains errors from the MAI and AWGN. 
 
III. SIMULATIONS 
In this section, we simulate the derived results to analyze 
the performance of CC and DOA techniques. Assume perfect 
power control of the system can be achieved and all 
multipaths attenuations are independent and identically 
distributed. Assume there are 20 active users in the coverage 
of a base station. The serving base station adopts smart 
antennas with M receiving elements for receiving. Each 
receiving antenna consists of a P-fingers RAKE receiver to 
form the coherent output from the received multipaths signals. 
The spreading factors (SF) set to 64 in the DPDCH channel 
and 256 in the DPCCH channel for all active users. Besides, 
12 ==σσ n  and kmph ,,  are either Rayleigh or Ricean fading 
depends on the simulation case.   
Fig.2 and Fig.3 are the estimated cumulative distribution 
function (CDF) results of the SINR if the channels are 
randomly generated 1000 times under the perfect channel 
estimation case. The number of receiving antennas could be 
either 2 or 8 while the finger number could be 1,3,5,7. In LOS 
case, Ricean factor of the channel sets to 3.52dB. Compare 
Fig.2 with Fig.3, we note that both the CC and DOA methods 
have approximately the same mean SINR performance. 
However, CC method is more robust because it has less 
standard deviation than the DOA method and this confirms 
our pervious prediction for the two methods.
