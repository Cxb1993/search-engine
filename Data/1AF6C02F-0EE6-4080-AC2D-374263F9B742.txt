ABSTRACT
The objective of this research project is to develop
a new approach for extending our previous work
of the prior discrete Fourier transform (PDFT)
method in computerized tomography (CT). In
particular we concentrate on the applications of
nondestructive testing (NDT), for which resolution
enhancement of the image reconstruction from
B-scans is achieved promisingly. To combat the
image degradation problem due to limited number
of discretely-collected data, a prior knowledge
about the object being detected is incorporated in
the image reconstruction, in the form of weighted
summation of specific basis functions. The basis
functions are characterized by images of circular
arc striplines. According to the demonstrations
with simulated and experimental B-scan data, our
newly-developed technique has proved a great
potential in improving the image quality.
Keywords: prior discrete Fourier transform,
computerized tomography, nondestructive testing,
resolution enhancement, B-scans.
1. REASON AND OBJECTIVE
In applications of nondestructive testing (NDT), for
safety and economic reason, it is of great impor-
tance to accurately locate and size defects such
as cracking and corrosion within the test object.
Destruction of the test object can usually provide
a more reliable assessment of the test object’s state
than the NDT, while it is typically more costly and
inappropriate in some circumstances. There have
been many successful modalities proposed for NDT,
the ultrasonic methods are very popular because of
flexibility, low cost, and in-line operation.
For practical NDT applications, the conventional
B-scan imaging technique is a well-established
modality which makes use of a single pulsed ultra-
sonic transducer scanning along the surface of the
test object to generate a cross section image. While
the B-scan technique has been employed efficiently
and pervasively, the physical focus of the finite-sized
ultrasonic transducer essentially limits its lateral res-
olution. Using lower frequencies is apparently better
suited for long range propagation, but broadening
the illumination pattern for less directivity.
There have been considerable works proposed
to combat the image degradation problem due to
the divergent radiation pattern of ultrasonic trans-
ducer, while a favorable approach is the synthetic
aperture imaging (SAI). The SAI is modeled based
1
where fˆ indicates the reconstructed image, and the
apodization weights an can be added to reduce the
sidelobe levels.
For practical issues, the received B-scan signals
are digitized and the matrix formalism is conve-
niently applied. If the discrete measured data is
stored in a matrix S, N different measuring posi-
tions and M sampling time for each position. The
discretized SAFT algorithm can be written as

3. ACCOMMODATION OF PRIOR DISCRETE
FOURIER TRANSFORM TO B-SCANS
From the discretization in the measurements, the
received signal at the time m△t from the n-th
measuring position can be formulated as the in-
tegration of the product of f and φn(m△t, x, y).
For simplicity and being employed in a numer-
ical computer, φn(m△t, x, y) is assumed to be
a uniform-amplitude circular arc stripline of ra-
dius vm△t/2 and of angular width θ, centered
at (un, 0), as shown in Fig. 3. To accommodate
the PDFT to B-scans, zero-valued sampled data
(sn(m△t) = 0) must be taken off. That is, the
basis image planes bq for q = 1, 2, . . . , Q are cho-
sen from {φn(m△t, x, y) | sn(m△t) ̸= 0, for n =
1, 2, . . . , N, m = 1, 2, . . . ,M}, where Q is the
number of all non-zero-valued sampled data. The
PDFT estimator is represented as
fˆ(x, y) = p(x, y)
Q∑
q=1
cq bq(x, y) , (6)
where p is the prior function which characterizes
the structural features of f . If d1, d2, . . . , dQ are all
non-zero-valued sampled data, based on the data
consistency of fˆ , we must have
dp =
Q∑
q=1
cqApq for p = 1, 2, . . . , Q (7)
with
Apq =
∫∫
p(x, y)bp(x, y)bq(x, y) dxdy . (8)
The reconstruction procedure is to solve Eq. (7) for
the coefficients cq, for q = 1, 2, . . . , Q, and then
substitute these coefficients into Eq. (6).

images (φα(α1△t, x, y), φα(α2△t, x, y), φβ(β1△t, x, y) and
φβ(β2△t, x, y)) can be chosen as the basis functions in Eq. (6)
because sα(α2△t) = sβ(β2△t) = 0.
4. DEMONSTRATIONS WITH SIMULATED
AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA
To test our findings, we applied our proposed
technique to both simulated and experimental B-
scan data. The investigation was acquired for test

research project, are chosen as basis functions in
the estimation procedure, while in harsh applica-
tions these bases can be obtained according to the
true illumination pattern radiated by the ultrasonic
transducer. The prior function is chosen to include
the true support of the object at least in order for an
acceptable reconstructed image, or better resolution
with a tight domain. From the image reconstruction
demonstrations with both simulated and experimen-
tal data values, the resolution enhancement from our
proposed technique was shown to be superior to the
SAFT, and essentially represents a great potential
in the applicability under realistic conditions and
a promising extension of the prior discrete Fourier
transform method for more other imaging applica-
tions.
6. EVALUATION OF ACHIEVEMENTS
This research project primarily concentrates on the
resolution enhancement of the image reconstruc-
tion from B-scans. According to our successful
research achievements, taking a further step towards
extending the applicability of the PDFT in theory
and practice, the NDT problem from ultrasonic B-
scans is in particular considered in this research
project and essentially proved a great potential for
this goal. A new mathematical formulation with
ultrasonic B-scans was successfully developed, and
also successfully demonstrated with simulated and
experimental data.
While the major accomplishments of this re-
search project is the development of a new prior-
knowledge-based algorithm with ultrasonic B-scans,
it is extensively suitable for other Radon transform
based inverse problems and earns a better under-
standing to the incorporation of prior knowledge
in the NDT problem from ultrasonic B-scans. All
the research outcomes under this project can be
carried into relevant studies of estimation, and also
encourage some more advanced research topics. All
the students who had participated in this research
project cannot only enhance advanced mathematical
backgrounds about Radon transform, SAFT and
PDFT, but also train themselves good skills in
computer programming and simulation as well as
experimental setup and validation.
