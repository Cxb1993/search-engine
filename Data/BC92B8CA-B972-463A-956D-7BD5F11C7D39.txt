Abstract 
    This report presents a range-free localization mechanism for sensors in a 
three-dimensional wireless sensor network based on the use of flying anchors. In the 
scheme, each anchor is equipped with a GPS receiver and broadcasts its location 
information as it flies through the sensing space. Each sensor node in the sensing area 
then estimates its own location by applying basic geometry principles to the location 
information it receives from the flying anchors. The scheme eliminates the 
requirement for specific positioning hardware, avoids the need for any interaction 
between the individual sensor nodes, and is independent of network densities and 
topologies. The performance of the localization scheme is evaluated in a series of 
simulations performed using ns-2 software and is compared to that of the Centroid 
and Constraint range-free mechanisms. The simulation results demonstrate that the 
localization scheme outperforms both Centroid and Constraint in terms of a higher 
location accuracy, a reduced localization time, and a lower beacon overhead.

1. 前言 
 
This report develops a range-free localization mechanism in which the positions 
of the sensor nodes are established on the basis of location information broadcast by 
flying anchors (could be helicopter, hot air balloon, aerial robot, etc.) as they travel 
through the sensing area. The localization method is based on the geometric corollary 
which states that a perpendicular line passing through the center of a sphere’s circular 
cross section also passes through the center of that sphere. It is assumed that the 
communication range over which a sensing node can detect broadcasts from the flying 
anchors is bounded by a spherical surface and that the sensor node is located at the 
center of this sphere. As the anchors fly through the sensing space, they broadcast 
their current positions and the sensor node chooses the locations of appropriate 
anchors to form circular cross sections of the sphere. Once two circular cross sections 
have been constructed, the center of the sphere (i.e. the sensor node location) is 
estimated by calculating the intersection point of the two perpendicular lines passing 
through the centers of the two circular cross sections, respectively. 
 
2. 研究目的 
 
Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research into wireless sensor 
networks as a means of developing advanced monitoring and control applications [1]. 
Wireless sensor networks are now widely used in many fields, including 
environmental and habitat monitoring, medical diagnostics, and disaster rescue. In 
most emerging applications, each sensor node is required to report not only its sensing 
data, but also its current position. Therefore, developing effective localization 
schemes has become a pressing issue in the advancement of wireless sensor networks. 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) [2] is the most widely used localization 
technique currently. However, fitting GPS receivers to a large number of sensor nodes 
is not cost effective in most applications. 
Sensor networks may often be deployed over three-dimensional areas in real 
applications, such as military sensing devices deployed in a non-planar battlefield, a 
sensor network floating in the air for tracking chemical plumes [3], or a fire 
monitoring network in a mountainous forest. For example, a helicopter drops a large 
number of sensors for monitoring temperature in a mountainous forest. The sensors 
could be deployed on trees or on the ground. Therefore, sensor localization for the 
three-dimensional space is needed. A review of the literature relating to the

The basis of the localization scheme is the geometric corollary which states that 
a perpendicular line passing through the center of a sphere’s circular cross section 
also passes through the center of that sphere. As shown in Fig. 1, the perpendicular 
line L1 passes through both the center of the circular cross section C1 and the center of 
the sphere S. Similarly, L2 passes through both C2 and S. The intersection point of L1 
and L2 is therefore S. In the localization mechanism, the center of the sphere is taken 
to indicate the sensor node’s position and the radius of the sphere corresponds to the 
maximum range over which the sensor node can detect the location information 
broadcast by the flying anchor.

Once four beacon points have been identified, two circular cross sections are 
constructed and the perpendicular lines passing through the centers of the circular 
cross sections determined. In Fig. 2, it is assumed that a set of beacon points {Bi, Bj, 
Bk, Bl} have been selected and that their corresponding locations are (xi, yi, zi), (xj, yj , 
zj), (xk, yk, zk), and (xl, yl, zl), respectively. Arbitrarily, {Bi, Bj, Bk} are selected to 
construct one circular cross section (S) and {Bj, Bk, Bl} are chosen to build a second 
cross section (S). As shown Fig. 2, the two circular cross sections intersect at Bj and 
Bk. Determining the perpendicular lines needs the normal vectors and centers of the 
two circular cross sections to be known. The normal vector of S (N) is obtained by the 
cross product of BiBj and BjBk. Similarly, the normal vector of S’ (N’) is given by the 
cross product of BjBk and BkBl. 
 
N = BiBj ×BjBk = (Nx, Ny, Nz) 
N’ = BjBk × BkBl = (N’x, N’y, N’z)

Based on the corollary which states that the perpendicular bisector of a chord 
contains the center of the circle, the intersection point of Lij and Ljk (L’jk and L’kl) is 
located at the center of the circle. By algebraic calculations, the coordinates of the 
center of the circle (C) can be shown to be: 
 
 
 
Similarly, the center of the circle (C’) is given by: 
 
 
 
The equations of the perpendicular lines L and L’ are given by: 
 
 
 
The center of the sphere can then be calculated by solving the intersection point 
of L and L’. The estimated location of the sensor node is therefore shown to be:
