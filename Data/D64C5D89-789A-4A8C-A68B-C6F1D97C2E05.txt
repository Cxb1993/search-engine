Abstract 
This research proposes a new approach to proactive learning based 
on structural tension and can be effectively carried out in the 
course-taking process. Two kinds of tension are created -- BasReq and 
AdvReq. BasReq is the basic requirement in which students are asked to 
keep up with teacher’s progress every week. AdvReq is the advanced 
requirement in which students are asked to keep improving everyday 
about those relevant to their needs in order to enhance their learning, and 
ultimately achieving happy learning in their mindsets. Students need to 
submit their BasReq and AdvReq every week to show what they have 
improved.  Based on these BasReqs and AdvReqs, a teacher can 
dynamically adjust his/her teaching strategy and course materials to keep 
appropriate tension in order to help students keep improve themselves. 
Our experiments began on four classes, about 300 students, in the 
spring semester of 2009, using Excel for BasReq and AdvReq in 
Moodle’s platform. At the end of the semester, we conducted a survey 
anonymously and want to see how much improvement students have been 
made in the whole semester. The results show that four classes all have 
significant improvement on both BasReq and AdvReq. However, it 
created tremendous load for the teacher in the whole process. This 
initiates our development of a system that not only can lesson teacher’s 
load but also can facilitate both teacher and student needs. A prototype 
system is thus constructed using Google Web Toolkit in cooperation with 
Moodle.

(d) Continual Service 
(3). Eight Habits 
Stephen Covey is a well-known author of the 
book, 7 habits of highly effective people, which 
is influential in both personal and organizational 
growth. BasReq and AdvReq apply these habits 
deeply. 
 Habit 1: Be Proactive  
 Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind  
 Habit 3: Put First Things First  
 Habit 4: Think Win/Win  
 Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then 
to Be Understood  
 Habit 6: Synergize 
 Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw 
 Habit 8: Find your voice and inspire 
others to find theirs 
3. Proactive Learning Model  
It started two years ago that we began to think 
how to improve students’ learning habits from 
passive learning to proactive learning. We first 
tried the Wiki in Moodle. Students were asked to 
maintain their own Wiki pages, keeping what 
they have learned. It did not work well because 
Wiki is too primitive and slow to edit. In the last 
two semesters, we gradually developed a 
proactive learning model based on structural 
tension. Instead of using Wiki, we used Excel to 
create two tension tables, BasReq and AdvReq, 
where is the basic requirement and AdvReq is 
the advanced requirement.  
    From our teaching experiences, we find the 
tension of “keeping up with teacher’s progress” 
is an effective way to be used as BasReq. Five 
action steps are in BasReq. 
 Come to class on time 
 Learn to grasp teacher’s key points in 
class 
 Review and fully understand teacher’s 
key points after class 
 Practice given exercises 
 Attempt to resolve any problems 
encountered 
    AdvReq is the requirement used to extend 
students’ learning vision and keep improving on 
what they desired eveyday. Thus, “keep 
improving every day and happy learning” 
become the core of AdvReq.   
    Students are encouraged to turn in BasReq 
and AdvReq every week so as to help them 
retrospect every week so that good habits can be 
gradually internalized.   
As to the grade assessment, they are three 
parts. The first part is the formal assessment that 
may include midterm and final exam, any other 
formal tests, etc. The second part is the BasReq 
that includes check rolls, quizzes, BasReq tables, 
etc. The third part is the AdvReq that includes 
AdvReq tables, any advanced item teacher 
suggests or student has achieved, etc. Statistics 
charts will be given so to help students realize 
his learning compare to all students. 
4. System Development 
4.1 System Analysis 
In current prototype system, the functional 
 6 
in night time), and Knowledge Commerce. They 
are total 225 students participated, and the valid 
questionnaires are 211.  
    For each measure in the questionnaire, there 
have two boxes to be checked, one is for the 
beginning of the semester, the other is for the 
end of the semester. Each box is associated with 
one of the seven degree levels ranging from 1 
(have none) to 7 (have fully) with 4 in the middle 
(have half). 
    On BasReq, there are six measures. 
1. Keep up with teacher’s progress 
2. Come to class on time 
3. Grasp teacher’s points in class 
4. Review and get teacher’s points fully 
5. Practice given exercises 
6. Problem solving capability 
    The result for BasReq is outstanding as 
shown in Fig.3. Each class has associated six 
bars, corresponding to the six measures from left 
to right. For each bar, there are two pieces. The 
blue one (down part) shows the overall average 
at the beginning of the semester, and the red one 
(up part) indicates the overall improvement 
being made at the end of the semester. The 
longer the red bar indicates more improvement. 
It shows that for every class at the beginning of 
the semester, there are 5 out of 6 measures are 
below 4, except the second one “come to class 
on time.” At the end of semester, all measures 
except the second one improve and go up over 4 
with the overall improvement goes up from 0.74 
to 2.84 levels. Discrete mathematics night-time 
class has the biggest improvement among four 
classes. It indicates that “come to class on time” 
measure gets the highest score on four classes, 
while “practice given exercise” gets the second 
highest. 
 
Fig.3 Comparison of BasReq result 
    On AdvReq, there are seven measures. 
1. Keep improving everyday 
2. Happy learning 
3. Focus on important, desired things 
4. Enough sleep, no stay up 
5. Three meals, balanced diet 
6. Exercise at least 3 times evey week 
7. Relax and listen inner voice everyday 
    The result for AdvReq is shown in Fig.4. 
The overall improvement for each class is 
consistent compare to that of BasReq. Discrete 
Mathermatics night time class remains the 
highest overall. “Focus on important, desired 
things” gets the highest score compare to other 
six measures. It also shows that all measures in 
AdvReq are from below average at the beginning 
of the semester up to above average (0.83~2.65 
level increase) at the end of the semester.
