Abstract 
 
Recently, LIDAR technique is in 
widespread use for obtaining a large number of 
points with three-dimensional coordinates. 
Detection and extraction of the objects from 
LIDAR data is needed for practical use. The 
LIDAR data, however, do not explicitly contain 
any geometric information, and features of 
objects implicitly exist in point clouds. The 
features, such as planes, lines and corners, can 
be only indirectly extracted by segmentation 
algorithms. In this article, we present a two-step 
algorithm based on the tensor voting framework 
for the extraction of planar features. In the first 
step, an initial normal vector field is derived 
from the initial tensor field determined by disk 
tensors. In the second step the tensor field for 
feature extraction is established by the normal 
vector voting method. The extraction of edge 
lines and ridge lines from the segmented roof 
patches is also discussed. Experiments based on 
airborne Lidar data demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed method, with those 
the results examined by the photogrammetric 
image data and the RTK GPS measurements.

ABSTRACT 
Recently, LIDAR technique is in widespread use for obtaining a large number of points with three-dimensional 
coordinates. Detection and extraction of the objects from LIDAR data is needed for practical use. The LIDAR 
data, however, do not explicitly contain any geometric information, and features of objects implicitly exist in 
point clouds. The features, such as planes, lines and corners, can be only indirectly extracted by segmentation 
algorithms. In this article, we present a two-step algorithm based on the tensor voting framework for the 
extraction of planar features. First, we infer the normal vector on each LIDAR point by the plate tensors derived 
from geometric relations among the LIDAR points. In the second step, these normal vectors are classified by the 
density cluster method based on the directions of normals. Density clusters can be divided into sub-clusters if 
the coordinates of points are introduced. The normal vectors at points in the same sub-clusters possess the same 
planar feature. The results of our experiments show that our algorithm is very effective in the automatic 
extraction of planar features from both airborne and terrestrial LIDAR data. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Airborne LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system becomes one of the important technologies in object 
modeling with increased quality and quantity of the LIDAR data. The LIDAR system can directly measure the 
three-dimensional data on objects. However, the geometric information is implicit in the point cloud. One of the 
major tasks is selecting an appropriate method to extract geometric features from the point cloud. If all objects 
are composed of planar segments (even curvy surface can be seen as an ensemble of fine planar meshes), the 
planar information in point clouds will be the most important element to reconstruct objects. There are many 
methods about extracting planar information from a point cloud. Base on data structure, it can be categorized 
into point cluster, line cluster, mesh cluster and voxel cluster. 
In point cluster method, it directly groups unstructuralized points based on local comparison of point properties. 
We can divide into two categories: (1) In feature space, it clusters point and its neighboring points if they are 
homogeneous of geometric property (Filing, 2002), (2) In parameter space, a well-know Hough (1962) 
transform is extended to a three-dimensional transform for extraction of planar faces from the irregularly

any two points in the same plane and transmit all possible normal vectors which will cause a vector field as plate 
tensor. In the study, plate tensor is the main geometric information of communication transmitting among point 
clouds.  
In Fig. 1, we suppose that point A, B and C are in the same plane, and a circle at these three points means plate 
tensor at each point. The plate tensor which transmit between point O and A represent that the possibility of 
normal vector. Because of normal vector perpendicular to the direction of A to B. Suppose 1e
v
 and 2e
v
 are any 
two orthogonal basis of plate tensor and 3e
v
 is the direction of A to O. The length of 1e
v
 and 2e
v
 is 1 and 3e
v
 
is 0. Considering the influence is lower while the distance among points is longer, the plate in Fig. 1(a) is 
smaller with the distance becomes longer. As Fig. 1(a), the distance of A to O is smaller than distance of C to O, 
the transmitting plate from A to O is bigger than it from C to O. If points lie on the planar feature, the tensor at O 
accumulated plate tensor from neighboring points A, B and C can be represented as the ellipse, as Fig. 1(b). The 
direction of the principle axes with the maximum eigenvalue is the normal vector of this plane. The accumulated 
tensor of any point can be expressed as 
å ==
m
i
p
iiw1 TT  
where m  is the number of neighboring points, pT is the plate tensor and iw  is the weight depend on 
Euclidean distance between any two points. At last, by eigen analysis of tensor on each point, the principle axes 
with maximum eigenvalue is the direction of normal vector.

3. CLUSTER 
The implicit normal vector of each point can be acquired by eigen analysis from the tensor of each point. For the 
purpose of clustering points with similar normal vector, an algorithm based on density cluster is used. At first, 
we transfer points to the normal space with three coordinate axes represented three components of normal vector. 
Take a simulated LIDAR data as an example in Fig. 2, there are 7 planes in the LIDAR data. After transferring 
data to the normal space, it shows 5 point clusters which mean 5 main normal directions in this data set.

compares the difference of normal vector at any point with its neighbor points from arbitrarily seed point, and 
merges similar points to the same group. Because the angle difference of the normal vector around the ridge are 
very small, it is easy to consider as the same point cluster, as Fig. 3(a). It just extracts only two planar point 
cluster, one is a plane of ground, and another is a plane of the roof. If the normal vector clusters is considered, it 
can segment point clusters with different planes. In Fig. 3(b), we can find 7 main planes of the simulated 
building and different color means different planar point cluster.

Figure 3. Compare with the cluster method of which with unknown and known normal vector cluster 
Take airborne LIDAR data for an example, it obtains planar clusters by region growing with known normal 
vector. In Fig. 4(a), except ground, there are 3 main planar feature (plane A, B, C), and plane B is a curvy plane. 
There are some noise points caused by trees near the building. In this example, density of point cloud is 1.2 
point per meter square, and distance of each point to its neighboring points is within 3 meter. Area of plane A is 
about 153´  meter square which is smaller than other planes in the Fig.. There are 90% of points clustered 
successfully in plane A, because of a few of noise near the plane A, and their normal vectors of every point are 
similar. But points lay on the boundary of plane B and C are influenced by its surrounding noise caused by trees. 
It is hard to identify whether the surrounding noise is belong to the same cluster by its normal vector. Besides, it 
shows that cluster method is also work to curvy plane from the cluster result of plane B. In summary, the result 
of the cluster in Fig. 4(b) shows that we can segment 3 planar point clusters reasonably.

Figure 4. An example of airborne LIDAR data set and the result of cluster 
The most difference of terrestrial and airborne LIDAR data is that there are more normal vector directions of 
planar feature and higher density of point clouds in terrestrial LIDAR data. Figure 5(a) is a terrestrial LIDAR

considered for separating planar patches successfully. As for two neighboring planes with the same normal 
vector, the height difference that a distance of any two points project to their mean normal direction is included 
to assist in separating these planes. However, some points lay on the boundary of the plane are influenced by the 
neighboring noise or other planes, it cause the method cannot group these points into the correct cluster. As 
Euclidean distance between these points to their neighboring plane is considered, the influence will be reduced. 
In summary, the result of the experiments shows that the process of the cluster for planar feature is useful in 
both airborne and terrestrial LIDAR data. Also the curvy plane is extracted successfully.

distributed point sets(Vosselman 1999). 
Other than point cluster, most of algorithms cluster points on the structuralized element. Structuralization of 
LIDAR data can be categorized to line, mesh and voxel structure. (1) In line cluster, Jiang and Bunke (1994) 
describe a scan line segmentation method for extraction of planar faces on range images. The principle of the 
algorithm is region growing in scan line segments. Haala and Brenner (1997) extract scan lines from the regular 
DSM grid and divide them into straight line segments based on geometric relation between point to its 
neighboring lines. And the line segment are added to a region depend on their geometric property such as the 
perpendicular distance between its two endpoints and the plane equation of the region. (2) In mesh 
structralization, it also can be divided into regular and irregular mesh. Much algorithm applied for segmentation 
of LiDAR data has in common that they work in the regular grid. In regular grid, region growing of similar 
pixels is used for segmentation of planar faces (Geibel and Stilla (2000). For irregular mesh, TIN (Triangular 
Irregular Network) is used. A planar segmentation algorithm based on TIN structure merges triangle meshes into 
planar segments by measuring similarity between adjacent triangle meshes (Gorte, 2002). (3) An algorithm of 
planar feature extraction based on Octree structure can be taken into voxel cluster. The plane in each sub-voxel 
is determined and then merged neighboring voxel with similar property of plane (Wang and Tseng, 2004). 
The method show in the article is clustering of points with planar property on the original points directly. First, 
we infer the implicit normal vector of each point based on Tensor Voting proposed by Medioni (2000). Second, 
the cluster method based on density cluster is used for grouping the similar normal vector in the normal space. 
Finally, it separates into different plane clusters depend on its position in the origin space. We take airborne and 
terrestrial LIDAR data for our experiments to show the effect on the automatic extrac tion of planar features 
from LIDAR data. 
2. TENSOR COMMUNICATION 
Second-order symmetric tensor is characteristic of describing one or multiple orientations. It can be expressed in 
matrix T , and in which 1e
v
, 2e
v
 and 3e
v  indicate three independent and orthogonal eigenvector. The 
coordinate system consists of this three eigenvector is called the principle system, 1l , 2l  and 3l  are 
eigenvalues with respect to the three directions of 1e
v , 2e
v
and 3e
v
. They are real and 321 lll ³³ . If T  is a 
positive-semidefinite tensor, 1l , 2l  and 3l  must be larger or equivalent to zero.

The LIDAR data provide only three-dimensional Cartesian coordination of points. Other implied vector 
information cannot be directly obtained. The algorithm based on tensor voting is used for deriving these vector 
information. The kernel of tensor voting is tensor communication among points. Each point receives vector 
information from neighboring points and use tensor addition to store all information. In this article, we suppose

Figure 2. Simulated data set and it normal vector cluster 
In this article, we use a method based on density cluster to cluster points with similar planar property. Density of 
each point represents the potential of being a cluster center. We define density is the number of points within the 
radius of each points. The clustering method first searches a point with maximum density and set this point as 
the first cluster center. If there is more than one point with maximum density, we select one randomly. For 
searching the next higher density, then it has to group the points within the radius of the decided cluster center to 
eliminate the influence of the decided cluster center. Repeat to first step, we can find the next cluster center by 
searching the other higher density point. The iteration stops until the next density lower than tolerance. Finally, 
the N clusters show that there are N normal directions in the data set. However, the different plane in the origin 
space may have the same normal vector. We transfer each cluster with the same normal vector to origin space 
and segment these points depend on their position in the origin space. 
The cluster method on normal vector and position can cluster points with the similar planar property in a large 
amount of points reasonably. But a few of point on the plane can not be clustered to its planar cluster correctly. 
Most of these points lie around the location that is intersection of two roof plane. Because of the point lay 
around the location receive planar information from two different planes, it cause to incorrectly infer the normal 
vector of the point. To overcome the problem, we compare the normal vector difference of each point in each 
planar cluster and its neighboring points not clustered yet to decide which point can be clustered to its 
neighboring planar cluster. If the difference is lower than the tolerance, we regard the point as its neighboring 
planar cluster. 
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT 
This research obtains normal vector of points from point clouds by eigen analysis of tensor after tensor voting. 
Then obtains point cluster of different planes by density cluster. This experiment compares the difference 
between region growing with unknown and known normal vector cluster on airborne and terrestrial LIDAR data 
respectively. 
We use region growing with unknown and known normal vector cluster on a set of simulated LIDAR data. This 
data contains a building with a ridge which angle is about 160. The first step, we obtain normal vector of each 
point by eigen analysis of the tensor and group the points with similar property of plane. By region growing, it

data of a small building which includes about 11 planes. The radius of neighborhood around each point is set to 
2 meter for building the relation between points. In Fig. 5(b), because of density in plane ? and ? is much less 
than in other planes and the radius set to 2 meter is not enough, these two planes are not found successfully.

In addition, when two neighboring planes with the same normal vector, point on different planes will be segment 
as the same point cluster. In Fig. 6(a), two different planes have the same color which means they are segment as 
the same point cluster because of they have similar normal vector. To solve this problem, we add one more 
condition of the height difference between each point and its neighboring points for determining in region 
growing. The height difference is defined as the vector between any two point projects to their mean normal 
vector. If the height difference is larger than the tolerance, we separate them as two different planes. We can 
obtain the height difference d  by product of the vector from each point to its neighboring point vv  and mean 
normal vector n

vector in the Fig. 6 are clustered as two planes successfully. As Fig. 6(b), different color means different point 
cluster.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
In the study, we use tensor to transmit all possible normal vectors among points. The implied normal vector on 
each point is inferred by eigen analysis of each tensor received from neighboring points. Then, the density 
cluster method use to obtain the normal cluster in the data set. Furthermore, the position of each point is
