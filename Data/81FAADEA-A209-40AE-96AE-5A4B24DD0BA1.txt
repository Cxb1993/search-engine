圖三、單級及三級馬赫任德干涉儀頻道交錯器模擬結果
當光訊號由圖一左方光波導輸入後，經過 3dB分光/耦合器，分成兩個相同的光訊號，該光訊號為
輸入光訊號強度的一半，分別經過兩環型共振腔及不同長度的光路徑，再利用 3dB分光/耦合器將兩訊
號結合後，輸出至右方兩光波導。由於兩光路徑的長度不同，以及兩環型共振腔與光路徑的光功率耦
合係數不同，會造成兩光訊號延遲的效果不同。光訊號會在特定的波長有分開的效果。
藉由理論模擬，如圖二，所設計的光頻道交錯器，具有極佳方形通帶頻譜特性，在 30dB的串音
4耦合器分光比的製程誤差來源，主要有元件折射率差值、光波導寬度，及兩光波導間的距離。目前尚
無較好的方法改善，因此，由 3dB分光/耦合器製作的好壞，代表的是製程能力的好壞。
四、結論
本計畫提出新穎光頻道交錯器，具有相當好的方形通帶的頻譜特性，串音干擾值也高達 40dB以
上。在特性上遠優於目前所發表文獻，如三級馬赫任德干涉儀光頻道交錯器或是單環型共振腔輔助光
頻道交錯器等。我們針對元件的誤差做模擬研究與探討，如馬赫任德干涉儀光路徑長度及 3dB分光/
耦合器分光比，同時也提出改善的方法，期能在製作前，將誤差的可能性降低，提高元件製作的穩定
性。

the notch frequency also increases, although marginally. While
varying W2, the gap dimension g3 is kept constant. The opti-
mized dimensions of the proposed structure are given in Table 1.
The simulated and measured responses of the proposed ﬁlter are
shown in Figure 7. It is seen from the S21 response that the ﬁlter
exhibits a notched stop band at 5.1 GHz. The measured band-
width is observed to be less than the simulated. This is due to
the fabrication errors in realizing small dimensions of the ﬁlter.
The notched band response is also evident from the difference in
the surface current distribution on the rings as shown in Figure 8
for various frequencies. It is clearly seen from the current distri-
butions that strong resonance are observed on the ring at the
notched frequency 5.1 GHz [Fig. 8(c)] with very high surface
current density. At the centre of the passband (6.85 GHz), the
current density on the rings is very weak [Fig. 8(d)]. At the 3
dB cutoff frequencies, 3.22 GHz and 9.76 GHz resonances are
seen on the ring [Figs. 8(b) and 8(d), respectively]. The current
density on the rings at 3.22 GHz is very low, whereas at
9.76 GHz the current density is seen to be very high, but
because of strong resonances, there is no transmission to the out-
put port. At out off-band frequencies the current densities are
very low as the matching is not good at these frequencies. Hence
at 5.1 GHz, frequency signals are not transmitted because of res-
onant coupling to the rings. As is evident from Figure 5, this fre-
quency can be controlled with width W3 of the rings. As men-
tioned, the notch frequency can be controlled by the width of
the rings at the back. A photograph of the fabricated ﬁlter is
shown in Figure 9.
4. CONCLUSIONS
A CPW-based UWB ﬁlter with a band notch characteristics is
proposed and demonstrated. It has been seen that the proposed
ﬁlter has reasonably good response in the passband and exhibits
a notched band at 5.1 GHz. Compared with other published ﬁl-
ters, the proposed structure gives signiﬁcantly sharper cutoffs.
Being a CPW-based structure, the proposed ﬁlter can be easily
integrated with active components. The position of the notched
band can be controlled by adjusting the width of the rectangular
rings at the backside.

ABSTRACT: We presented an optical microring-assisted Mach–
Zehnder interferometer interleaver. With the microrings-assisted, the
optical interleaver exhibits a near-square passband shape. The
fabricated device behaves as a 1  2 100–200 GHz interleaver
operating at 1.55 mm region. The insertion loss (ﬁber-to-ﬁber loss) is
1.72 dB, and the stopband extinction ratio is about 20 dB. Design and
simulation results are also discussed for further improvement of its
performance. The good performance makes this interleaver very
attractive for future optical communication systems. VC 2010 Wiley

usable width ratio is about 40% for a single-ring-assisted MZI
interleaver, and up to 71% with a double-ring-assisted. It is still
65% for a double-ring-assisted MZI interleaver at 40 dB cross-
talk isolation. With the microrings-assisted, they exhibit near-
square passband shapes. The double-ring-assisted MZI interleaver
is with more excellent performance. The shape of interleaver
spectrum is mainly determined by the through-port transmission
amplitude coupling coefﬁcients of the ring, when the ring length
is matched twice the MZI delay length plus one half of central
wavelength. The derived value of q is 1/3 for a single-ring-
assisted MZI interleaver. For a double-ring-assisted MZI interlea-
ver, these derived values are q1 ¼ 1/7 and q2 ¼ 3/5, respectively.
3. DISCUSSIONS
Figure 3 shows the transmission spectra of a traditional MZI
and a three-stage MZI interleaver. The traditional MZI interlea-
ver has a poor passband shape, and the usable width ratio is just
4% at 30 dB crosstalk isolation. The three-stage MZI interleaver
consists of four directional couplers and three delay lengths [6].
The four power coupling ratios of the couplers are designed to
be 0.5, 0.5119, 0.0206, and 0.0238 to obtain a wide and ﬂat
passband. The three delay lengths are L, 2L, and 4L, where L
is the same as the parameter of microring-assisted MZI interlea-
ver. The phase terms of three delay lengths are 1.5721,
3.1385, and 3.1356, respectively. The three-stage MZI interlea-
ver also shows a good ﬂat passband response. The usable width
ratio is about 41% at 30 dB crosstalk isolation and the perform-
ance is just the same as the single-ring-assisted MZI interleaver.
However, the three-stage MZI interleaver has more delay num-
bers and longer delay lengths than the microring-assisted MZI
interleaver. That means the lattice-form based MZI interleaver
occupies considerable space.
Figure 4 shows the measured spectrum of a double-ring-
assisted MZI interleaver. The transmission spectrum was meas-
ured with an ampliﬁed spontaneous emission light source and an
optical spectrum analyzer. Any variation of the ring lengths,
MZI delay length, 3 dB couplers, and coupling coefﬁcients of
rings could greatly affect the performance of the interleaver.
The interleaver exhibited an insertion loss of 1.72 dB (ﬁber-to-
ﬁber loss) and a near-square passband shape. The measured
passband shape nearly ﬁtted the simulated shape to get almost
correct through-port transmission amplitude coupling coefﬁcients
of the two rings (q1 ¼ 1/7 and q2 ¼ 3/5). These more accurate
values can be provided by the phase error measurement tech-
nique [11]. The FSR was about 196 GHz, very close to the
design value of 200 GHz. The error was due to the variations of
the ring lengths and MZI delay length. The stopband extinction
ratio was about 20 dB. The degradation of the stopband extinc-
tion ratio in this device was due to nonperfect fabrication of the
3 dB couplers. If the 3 dB couplers could be more accurately
fabricated, simulation shows that the stopband extinction ratio
can be further improved.
4. CONCLUSIONS
A microring-assisted MZI interleaver can be used as an alterna-
tive for the lattice-form interleaver ﬁlter or others. Simulations
show that a single-ring-assisted MZI interleaver has an almost
the same performance as a three-stage MZI interleaver. A dou-
ble-ring-assisted MZI interleaver yields a much better perform-
ance than a single-ring-assisted MZI interleaver. We also dem-
onstrated a double-ring-assisted MZI interleaver with 200 GHz
FSR and a near-square passband shape. The insertion loss of
this interleaver was 1.72 dB (ﬁber-to-ﬁber loss). The stopband
extinction ratio was about 20 dB. It could be further improved if
ideal 3 dB couplers are fabricated. However, the performance of
the device is equal or superior to existing interleavers.
