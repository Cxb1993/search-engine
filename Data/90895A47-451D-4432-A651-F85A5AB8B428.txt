Pole-placement design for linear time-invariant multivariable feedback 
system by solving Matrix Diphantine Equation  
from a non-square system of equation 
 
 
Ⅰ. Objective 
Develop a pole-placement design scheme and procedure with insight and generaliziblity for 
LTI multivariable feedback systems by solving Matrix Diphantine Equation from a non-square 
system of equation. 
 
II. Introduction and Literature Survey  
This approach is concerned with output feedback pole placement designs of multivariable 
linear time-invariant systems. Existing works on this topic are plentiful. Some of them involve 
state space treatments, e.g. Fletcher and Magni [1], Al-Mulhairi [2], and Song and Ishida [3]. 
Others focus on some special situations or use some special techniques. For example, in Keerthi 
and Phatak [4], Franze and Muraca [5], and Zhang et al. [6], the problem of pole placement under 
constrained controller structure and/or using static output feedback is addressed; Chen and Hsu 
invoke the use of least-square error algorithm [7]; Ravi et al. deal with decentralized pole 
placement [8]; Crisalle and Ballamudi consider pole placement under parameter uncertainties in 
discrete-time systems [9]; Rosenthal and Wang focus on the problem of assignability of arbitrary 
poles for special and generic systems [10]; Wang and Chow treat the problem of regional pole 
placement using low-order controllers [11]. Attempts to generalize this approach to multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) systems lead to design procedures that are still cumbersome to use [12]-
[14].

where ζ(s)=A–1(s)u(s) is the “partial state” of the plant. 
The idea here is to perform elementary row operations on (1) such that all variables are 
eliminated except for the command input r(s) and the plant partial state ζ (s). One way of 
achieving this is to multiply the first row from the left by –Δ (s), the third row by )s(D− , the 
fourth row by −C(s) and add the results together. This yields

This equation, together with the fourth equation of (1), gives the closed-loop system equation: 
  F(s)ζ(s)= Δ(s)r(s)  (3a) 
  y(s)=B(s)ζ(s)  (3b) 
where 
   F(s)=D(s)A(s)+C(s)B(s).   (3c) 
Equations (3a) and (3b) can also be compactly represented as

(iii) )s(Aˆ  is row-reduced. 
Eq. (6b) can be solved in two simple steps: setting up a square system of equations and inverting 
the system. 
1. Setting up a Square System of Equations 
Let )s(Aˆ  be of row degrees r1, r2, …, rp, respectively. Then )s(Aˆ  in general will be given as 
  )]s(aˆ[)s(ˆ ij=A ]aˆsaˆsaˆ[ ij01rij 1rrijr iiii +++= −− " , i,j=1, 2, …, p. (7) 
Since )s(Aˆ 1− )s(Bˆ  is strictly proper and )s(Aˆ  is row-reduced (i. e. r1+ r2+…+ rp=deg det )s(Aˆ =n), 
the row degrees of )s(Bˆ  will be less than the corresponding row degrees of )s(Aˆ . Thus, )s(Bˆ  is 
given by  
  )]s(bˆ[)s(ˆ ij=B ]bˆsbˆsbˆ[ ij02rij 2r1rij 1r iii1 +++= −−−− " , i,j=1, 2, …, p. (8) 
Since )s(Aˆ 1− )s(Bˆ  is strictly proper and )s(Aˆ  is row-reduced (i. e. r1+ r2+…+ rp=deg det )s(Aˆ =n), 
the row degrees of )s(Bˆ  will be less than the corresponding row degrees of )s(Aˆ . Thus, )s(Bˆ  is 
given by 
 
 )]s(bˆ[)s(ˆ ij=B ]bˆsbˆsbˆ[ ij02rij 2r1rij 1r iii1 +++= −−−− " ,   i,j=1, 2, …, p. (8) 
In order to achieve an equation system with equal number of unknowns as equations, let 
 )]s(cˆ[)s(ˆ ij=C = ij02kij 2k1kij 1k cˆscˆscˆ i1ii +++ −−−− " ,            i, j=1, 2, …, p (9a) 
where the positive integers ki are chosen to obey the constraint  
  k1+k2+…+kp=n. (9b) 
Also, let )s(Dˆ and )s(Fˆ be of the form 
 )]s(dˆ[)s(ˆ ij=D = ]dˆsdˆsdˆ[ ij02ij 21ij 1 +++ −γ−γ−γ−γ " ,   i, j=1, 2, …, p (10a) 
  7 
 
 
 
 γ≧max ( k1, k2, …, kp ). (10b) 
 
 )]s(fˆ[)s(ˆ ij=F ]fˆsfˆsfˆ[ ij01ij 1ij iiii +++= −ρ−ρρρ " ,  i,j=1, 2, …, p (11a) 
where  
 iρ = ir +γ−1. (11b) 
  (i.e. row degrees of )s(Fˆ = row degrees of )s(Aˆ + row degrees of )s(Dˆ .) 
 For example, for p=2, r1=3, r2=1, k1=1, k2=3, andγ=max(k1, k2)=3, )s(Aˆ , )s(Bˆ , )s(Fˆ , )s(Cˆ  and )s(Dˆ  
will be given by

(12) 
The unknown coefficients cˆ ’s and dˆ ’s can be solved from (12) if the square matrix on the L.H.S. 
is non-singular. Note that the block-structure of  (12) is the same as that of (6b). 
 
2. Ensuring Non-singularity of the Equation System 
Let the square matrix in (12) be denoted by M(k1, k2). The non-singularity of M(k1,k2) can be 
guaranteed by the following lemma in generalized p×p case.  
 
Lemma: Let M(k1, k2, …, kp) be the square matrix that is generated from the L.H.S. of (6b) by 
k1 k2 γ γ

Step 1  Choice of Diophantine Equation: 
The Diophantine equation in its “Sylvester-form” (12) allows the feedback design to be 
accomplished easily. The actual equation depends on the choice of k1 and k2. In this example, 
the order of the plant is n=5. The “degree” of )s(Dˆ  from Remark (a) is deg det )1(2)s(ˆ −γ=D , 
where γ according to (10b) can be chosen to be any integer≧max(k1, k2). Hence in view of the 
constraint k1+k2=n=5 in (9b), in order to achieve a minimum-degree design for )s(Dˆ , one may 
chooseγ=max(k1, k2)=3 and (k1, k2)=(3, 2) or (2, 3). Let say we choose the former, then Eq. 
(12) in this case would read

which is the same closed-loop equation as obtained in [14]. The same design processes are 
carried out for the other two configurations in the table and same closed-loop equations as in 
[14] are approved. 
 
ⅤI. Conclusion 
A scheme of laying out a square equation system obtained by coefficient matching is 
presented. A “Sylvester-form” of the Diophantine equation is constructed, which is suitable for 
designing the feedback controllers in the various configurations incorporated easily. An analytical 
treatment is introduced to ensure the invertibility of the Diophantine equation. An example 
extracted from the literature is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
