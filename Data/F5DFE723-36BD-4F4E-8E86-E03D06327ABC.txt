Development of a Novel Hot Embossion System for 
Replication of Curved Surface Micro-Structure 
Abstract: 
Because of the growing demand for Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS), microelectronics, 
communication, optoelectronics, and biotechnology, the miniaturization of components and 
systems has been progressing rapidly. The methods of polymer processing have been developed 
for the mass manufacture of micro parts due to their versatility and the ease of batch fabrication. 
Among the variety of polymer processing methods, hot embossing is the most prominent 
processes for the replication of large area microstructure, offering low cost and high precision. 
The hot embossing is widely employed for the forming and microstructure replication of flat 
plane. The technology of forming and replication of curved surface with microstructure must be 
advanced improvement. The polymer parts of curved surface with microstructure have significant 
application for the specific optoelectronics components.  
The purpose of this project is focused on the development of curved surface hot embossing. 
In this project an elastic bag that was filled with various media of fluid will be used to replace 
the hot plate that used in traditional hot compression process. The employment of elastic bag 
can overcome the limit of traditional hot embossing and forming the micro/nano scale 
structure on especial curved surface. This project has successfully completed the development 
of elastic bag hot embossing system, and provides a novel technology to the hot embossing of 
large area on flat or curved surface. The results of this project improve the design and product 
ability of optoelectronics products that need micro/nano structure on surface.

Abstract 
The impact micro-injection molding is a novel method to product tiny and thin-sheet polymer parts [1]. In order to 
understand the performances of the impact micro injection molding, a lab-made impact type micro-injection machine 
and a mold with spiral cavities and transparent window was used. In this study, both methods of flow visualization 
and computer numerical simulation are employed. The effects of the operation parameters on the flow length, 
injection pressure, shear rate, and hammer motion during molding process are systematically investigated. The 
operation parameters include the cavity depth, cavity width, mold temperature, air pressure of accelerating cylinder, 
air pressure of packing cylinder, and hammer mass. 
 
1 Introduction 
The impact type micro-injection molding machine utilizes a fast moving air piston attached with a hammer to impact 
a plunger; and the plunger injects the melt into the micro-cavity at extremely high speed. In order to understand the 
effects of operation parameters on the molding process of spiral mold, a flow visualization experiment and the 
computer simulation are employed.  
 
2 Experiment and Simulation Setups 
Fig.1 shows the construction of the lab-made impact type micro-injection machine. This machine is equipped with an 
accelerating cylinder (1) and a packing cylinder (2) to control the impact speed and packing pressure separately. This 
micro-injection molding machine can achieve a maximum impact speed of 7000 mm/s. Fig.2 shows the construction 
of the spiral mold. In this study, the dynamic system shown in Fig. 3 is used to simulate the motion of impact hammer 
and the compression of billet inside the injection sleeve (10), and the Lahti equation is adopted to calculate the melt 
flow inside the spiral cavity, which is expressed as

3 Results and Discussion 
Fig.4 shows the melt front during the molding process of spiral cavity by the flow visualization and simulation. Fig. 5 
exhibits the relative injection pressure and shear rate of computer simulation. The deep cavity has longer flow length 
and filling time and less injection pressure and shear rate. 
Fig.6 and 7 show the effects of the air pressure of accelerating cylinder (Pa) and packing cylinder (Pp). The larger air 
pressure of accelerating cylinder will have larger impact speed and result in larger impact energy. Therefore, it 
generates larger injection pressure and causes faster filling speed and flow length at the impact moment. The increase 
of air pressure of packing cylinder will not have significant effect in the impact-filling stage [1], but will elongate the 
melt flow length and flow time in the pressure-filling stage. 
Fig.8 and Fig.9 display the effects of the mold temperature and hammer mass. The higher mold temperature has 
longer flow time and flow length, but just has a little effect in the impact-filling stage. Oppositely, the increase of 
hammer mass will result in faster filling speed and flow length in the impact-filling stage, but almost without any 
effect in the pressure-filling stage.  
Fig. 10 shows the effects of cavity widths on the flow length. The increase of cavity width will decrease the flow 
length at the impact moment.
