stand out with the promise of significant link 
quality enhancement and huge system capacity increase 
by exploiting the spatial resource without 
sacrificing bandwidth. In addition, because the 
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) 
technique with the advantages of high data

and the Code Division Multiplex Access (CDMA) 
technique with the advantages of interference

In this project, we will consider realizing the MIMO

enhanced robustness against CFO will be proposed as 
the solution referral and policy in the future 
wireless communication systems over the frequency-
selective multipath fading channel. We will first 
investigate the CFO effects on the MIMO system and 
will also propose coarse CFO estimation and a 
frequency- RAKE scheme for coherently collecting 
multipath signals. Furthermore, we will put emphasis 
on developing a novel blind space-frequency decision-

receiver to achieve high spectrum efficiency and to 
meet the demands of high data rate and high link

MCMOE-Based CFO Estimator Aided with the
Correlation Matrix Approach for STBC MC-CDMA
Downlink Systems
Tsui Tsai, Lin Member, IEEE, and Fuh-Hsin Hwang, Member, IEEE,
Abstract
This paper addresses the estimation problem of carrier frequency offset (CFO) in the downlink transmission
of space-time-block-coded multicarrier code-division multiple-access systems over multipath fading. A multiply
constrained minimum output energy-based blind CFO estimator is proposed, which is simply assisted with the
presented correlation matrix approach to achieve the CFO estimate efficiently. We formulate a simple two-level
CFO estimator based on the optimization of the receiver output power as well as the data correlation matrix. In
the first level, all possible CFO candidates are found by evaluating the well-defined estimate merit figure. Then,
exploiting the multiple constraints in the design of the MCMOE receiver, a criterion is used in level two to determine
the exact CFO estimate. Numerical results are presented to verify that both precise CFO estimation and reliable
error performance can be achieved even when the channel is dominated by noise since the impact of CFO on
the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and bit error rate are effectively removed by the proposed CFO
estimator.

I. INTRODUCTION
THE multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) [1]-[2] is known to provide not onlyfrequency diversity but also resistance to frequency-selective fading because it possesses both the
characteristics of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and CDMA schemes. For promoting
the link quality of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications [3]-[4], another highlighted
technique is the space-time block coding (STBC) [5], which offers remarkable diversity/coding gains
by applying simple linear processing appropriate to multiple transmit/receive antennas. It is intuitively
expected that the combination of STBC and MC-CDMA is an even powerful solution of the physical
layer. However, such a hybrid scheme suffers from the unfavorable effects inherited from MC-CDMA
systems. For instance, carrier frequency offset (CFO) is commonly caused either by the mismatch of
local oscillator frequency between the transmitter and receiver or the Doppler shift resulted from user’s
mobility. Inevitably, CFO destroys the orthogonality of subcarriers, and leads to system performance
degradation in case no countermeasure is adopted. The intent of this paper is to investigate the multiuser
receiver design for the STBC MC-CDMA downlink while considering the presence of CFO. In the past,
there have been a number of studies on CFO estimation for MC-CDMA systems. A training-based CFO
estimation using pilot symbols was presented in [6] at the expense of the spectral efficiency loss. Based
on the subspace concept, Liang proposed a blind CFO estimator [7] derived from the minimization of
the determinant with respect to the noise subspace matrix. In [8], Deng proposed an iterative MC-CDMA
receiver with CFO estimate, in which the generalized sidelobe cancelation technique is employed. In spite
of providing efficient CFO estimation for MC-CDMA systems, these above-mentioned schemes, which

where Ns is the number of data samples for computing the time-averaged version of the
correlation matrix. Note that only the submatrices related to x¯(p)(2i) and x¯(q)(2i + 1) should
be considered since the correlation matrix R is Hermitian symmetric.

η(ǫ). (10)
B. Multiply Constrained Minimum Output Energy (MCMOE)-based Estimation
Although the CFO estimate can be achieved by searching the value of ǫ which maximizes the EMF
shown in (9), we realized that the value of ǫ, which satisfies the criterion of (10), appears cyclically within
the interested interval of ǫ. This means that we require a further step to pick the only one correct CFO
estimate among these cyclically found values, say candidates. Substituting (1) into (8) and replacing ǫ
with ǫ¯d, we have

where φ(ǫd − ǫ¯d) = ej2π(ǫd−ǫ¯d)(N+Ng)/N . Here the additive noise terms are omitted for convenience of
analysis, and the time-independent value φ(4i+1)(ǫd − ǫ¯d) leads Γ(p,q)(ǫ¯d) to be a non-null submatrix.
Letting the constant κ , φ4i(ǫd − ǫ¯d) and using the fact of E{bk(i)bHk (i)} = I2, Γ(p,q)(ǫ¯d) can be
approximated by
Γ(p,q)(ǫ¯d) = κφ(ǫd − ǫ¯d)× 1

Without losing the generality, let us assume κ = 1 such that 2π(4)(ǫd − ǫ¯d)(N + Ng)/N = 2mπ where
m is an arbitrary integer. The CFO estimate ǫ¯d results as
ǫ¯d = ǫd −mN/ [4(N +Ng)] . (13)
It can be found that there exist Nǫ values of ǫ which satisfy the criterion of (10) where
Nǫ = ⌊(2 + 4ǫd) (1 +Ng/N)⌋+ ⌊(2− 4ǫd) (1 +Ng/N)⌋+ 1. (14)
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. XX, NO. XX, JANUARY 20, 2012 7
According to (21), the total output power of the MCMOE receiver results as

. (22)
It can be shown that (22) achieves a maximum value when ǫ¯d = ǫd. Thus, the CFO estimate can be
determined by the criterion shown below:
ǫˆd = argmax
ǫ∈Ω
P (ǫ) ≡ argmax

Note that (13) shows that the CFO estimate candidates are evenly separated with a minimum space of
N/ [4(N +Ng)], and the proposed MCMOE-based estimation can achieve an excellent performance while
the input SNR is sufficient, say larger than -10 dB. This will be verified by simulations in Section IV.
Once the CFO parameter is estimated by using (23), the information symbols will be straightforwardly
obtained by applying the principle of the Capon [3] or subspace [14] receiver on the CFO-compensated
data given by
y˜(i) = [INr ⊗ Ξ(−ǫˆd)] [Φ(i,−ǫˆd)⊗ INr ]y(i). (24)
IV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
In this section, we provide computer simulations with finite data samples to verify the efficiency of the
proposed CFO estimate scheme. Let us consider a ten-user MIMO MC-CDMA downlink that employs
two transmit/receive antennas over a Rayleigh fading channel with length of four. QPSK modulation
is used in the transmission, and the random spreading codes ck of length 32 are normalized such that
‖ck‖2 = 1. For ISI suppression, a CP of length 8 is utilized. Define SNR = 10 log10(σ21), and suppose all
users have an identical power level for simplicity. We evaluate the system performance for the proposed
scheme by examining the output SINR and BER of the Capon and subspace receivers while employing
the proposed CFO estimation technique, termed the enhanced Capon (E-Capon) and enhanced subspace
(E-Subspace). For comparison, the corresponding performance of the Capon and subspace receivers in a
CFO-free environment is also included.
Fig. 2 shows the EMF as a function of input SNR for ǫd = 0.2 and Ns = 103. It can be found that the
EMF reaches peaks at ǫ = 0, ±0.2, and ±0.4, which are termed the CFO estimate candidates, for all input
SNR. The sharpness of peaks indicates the excellent robustness against CFO provided by the proposed
estimator. It can be found that the difference between the values of a peak and a sidelobe increases
as the input SNR increases. This means that the performance of CFO estimation can be improved by
increasing the input SNR. In order to realize the characteristic of the proposed estimator supposed that
the CFO estimate is correctly selected at level one, the mean square errors (MSE’s) of the CFO estimate
are investigated while varying the input SNR and data sample number Ns, respectively. Fig. 3 plots the
MSE versus the input SNR for ǫd = 0.2 and Ns = 103. It shows that the MSE decreases while the input
SNR being increased, and the proposed scheme performs well even when SNR is very small, say -10 dB
because that the MSE performance is dominated by the statistical processing represented by (8) instead
of the channel noise [17]. The curve of the MSE versus Ns plotted in Fig. 4 for ǫd = 0.2 and SNR=-10
dB indicates that increasing the data sample number likewise improves the MSE performance.
Next, we evaluate the system performance in response to the input SNR, CFO ǫd and Ns. Fig. 5 depicts
the output SINR versus the input SNR given that ǫd = 0.2 and Ns = 103. It is observed that both the
E-Capon and E-Subspace have the performance comparable to those of the receivers which have no CFO.
This confirms that the correct CFO estimate can be selected from the candidates by employing the principle
similar to the MCMOE-based scheme at level two. Note that the performance degrades at high input SNR
due to the finite data sample effect. As expected, both the Capon and subspace receivers without using
the proposed technique collapse due to the desired signal cancelation. Fig. 6 presents the corresponding
BER for the considered system. In light of the subspace technique, the receiver provides a small amount

Abstract—In this paper, we proposed a derivative constraint
minimum output energy (MOE) receiver, which offers enhanced
robustness against carrier frequency offset (CFO). Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed receiver basically offers the
same performance as an optimal receiver with no CFO present.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA)
[?] is an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-
based multiuser system supporting high data rate services and
robustness to the adverse effect of frequency-selective fading
channel. The above advantages have made MC-CDMA a
potential air interface for 4G wireless communication systems.
However, just as with the CDMA systems, an MC-CMDA
system is also subject to limiting factors such as multiple
access interference (MAI) [2] and inter-carrier interference
(ICI) induced by carrier frequency offset (CFO) [3]. In the
practical communication systems, there may be substantial
carrier frequency errors incurred by the mismatch between the
local oscillators of the transmitter and receiver and Doppler
shift. For example, a 2.4-GHz Zigbee application may have
a maximum CFO of ±192 kHz [3]. This leads to about 0.2
normalized CFO with respect to the 2 MHz signal bandwidth.
Constrained linear minimum output energy (MOE) multiuser
receiver [4] has been proposed as an effective and relatively
simple scheme to combat MAI. The MOE receiver aims at
minimizing the total output power subject to some constraints
that guarantee the power of the user-of-interest at the receiver
output is held constant. Under proper conditions, the strong
MAI can be effectively suppressed and performance of MOE
receivers will be close to that of the optimal minimum
mean-squared error (MMSE) receiver [5] without employing
training symbols. The MOE receiver is extremely sensitive
to the mismatch in the signal preserving constraint. In MC-
CDMA systems, CFO [6] will cause disparity between the
preserving constraint and the received data and deteriorate the
performance significantly. As a remedy, the subspace MOE
(SMOE) receiver [7] was proposed. Unfortunately, large CFO
and/or insufficient data samples will make it fail to correctly
retrieve the transmitted data, especially for high input signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or weak MAI. As an alternative, a
decision-directed MOE scheme [8] was proposed the offers
enhanced robustness against CFO for MC-CDMA downlink
systems. In the case of lower input SNR, the erroneous channel
estimation due to the lower output signal-to-interference-plus-
noise ratio (SINR) of the receiver makes this approach fail to
produce a reliable performance in BER.
In this paper, a robust derivative constrained receiver is
proposed. A coarse CFO estimate is first determined from
a few plausible candidates in accordance with the fact that
the output power of the MOE receiver decreases with the
increase of CFO. Preliminary CFO estimate is then sent to
the MOE scheme incorporating with the derivative constraints.
Numerical results indicate that the proposed receiver possesses
excellent robustness against CFO and the finite data sample
effect as well as significant performance improvement when
compared with conventional receivers.
II. DATA MODEL
The scenario considered herein involves a baseband digital
MC-CDMA system with N subcarriers, K active users, an L-
resolved multipath fading channel with an impulse response
hk for the kth user, in which the modulated symbols are spread
by the user’s spreading code ck of length N . The received
signal in the presence of CFO observed at the ith symbol
block is given by
y(i) =
K∑
k=1
ψi−1k F
HEǫkFHkckbk(i) + n(i)
=
K∑
k=1
ψi−1k F
HEǫkdkbk(i) + n(i), (1)
where k is the user index, bk(i) is the transmitted data and is
assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.),
F ∈ CN×N denotes the inverse discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix with ej2π(m−1)(n−1)/N/√N to be its (m,n)th
element, the diagonal matrix Hk = diag{FH [hTk 0T ]T } is
the channel matrix, dk = FHkck represents the effective
signature vector of user k, ψk = ej2πǫk(N+Ng)/N is the phase
shift of the ith symbol, with Ng being the guard period to
combat inter-symbol interference (ISI) and being assumed to
be longer than the maximum path delay L. The CFO effect in
(1) is modeled by the diagonal matrix given by
Eǫk = diag{1, ej2πǫk/N , · · · , ej2(N−1)πǫk/N}, (2)
where ǫk is the related frequency offset normalized to subcar-
rier spacing. Finally, n(i) is independent on the transmitted
As an alternative, the estimate of the residual CFO δǫ can be
determined in accordance with maximizing the modified out-
put power of the MOE receiver obtained with the constrained
vector Eǫˆ1(I+ jδǫD)d1:
max
δǫ
[dH1 (I+jδǫD)
HEHǫˆ1R˜
−1Eǫˆ1(I+jδǫD)d1]
−1. (9)
The solution is given by
δǫ =
Im{dH1 EHǫˆ1R˜−1Eǫˆ1Dd1}
dH1 DE
H
ǫˆ1
R˜−1Eǫˆ1Dd1
, (10)
such that the CFO estimate is (ǫˆ1+δǫ). In consequence, the
transmitted symbol is decoded by
bˆ1(i) = dec{e−j2π(i−1)(ǫˆ1+δǫ)(N+Ng)/Nz(i)}. (11)
IV. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
Computer simulations were conducted to ascertain the ef-
ficacy of the proposed robust derivative constrained receiver
in an MC-CDMA system with ten active users (K=10) of
equal signal power. For all users, QPSK-modulated signals
were spread by random spreading codes of length 32 (N=32)
with a unit gain through a four-path Rayleigh fading channel,
in which the path gains were assumed to be i.i.d. unit variance
complex Gaussian random variables [9]. Note that in order to
investigate the statistical properties (ensemble averages) of a
Rayleigh fading channel, we used the complex Gaussian to
model the Rayleigh distribution and to describe the statistical
time varying nature of the received envelope of an individual
multipath component, a flat fading signal. In addition, the
4-ray Rayleigh fading model, made up of four independent
fading channels with uniform time delays among them, is
used for analyzing frequency selective fading [9]. In each
simulation, a total of 103 Monte Carlo trials were executed to
obtain the output SINR. To compare performance, the results
obtained with the MOE and SMOE receivers, and the MMSE
(optimal) receiver [5] were also included. The optimal receiver
utilized the fully pre-known transmitted data to compute
the weight vector. Furthermore, both the MOE and SMOE
algorithms incorporating with the proposed CFO scheme, in
which the value of Q is 100 to promise an acceptable CFO
estimate, were used to provide a fair comparison. Finally,
unless otherwise mentioned, the following standard parameters
were used throughout this section: Q=5, SNR=10 dB, ǫ1=0.2,
and Ns=500.
In the first set of simulations, the output SINR of the
proposed receiver was examined as a function of number of
the normalized frequency candidate Q. The results in Fig. 3
showed that the proposed receiver can successfully approach
the optimal one for Q > 4 even in the case of larger
normalized CFO. In addition, for a proper CFO (ǫ1 < 0.1), the
proposed scheme can always achieve a reliable performance,
which indicated the efficacy of the proposed receiver.
In the second set of simulations, the output SINR per-
formance was evaluated as a function of input SNR. The
corresponding results were shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, the
proposed receiver had a similar performance as that of the
optimal one. This confirmed that the proposed scheme ef-
fectively resisted CFO. The SMOE receiver produced some
degradation for high input SNR due to both the CFO and finite
data sample effects. The output SINR of the MOE receiver
decreased with an increase as input SNR. This led to the power
inversion effect. On the other hand, the MOE and SMOE
receivers incorporating with the proposed CFO estimator can
significantly boost the output SINR at the penalty of high
computational complexity, confirmed the assertion in Sect. 3.1.
In the third set of simulations, the CFO effect was investi-
gated with the normalized CFO varied from 0 to 0.5. Figure
5 showed the SINR curves. It is observed that the proposed
receiver possessed its excellent robustness against CFO by
successfully collecting the desired signal and canceling the
MAI even in a larger CFO. The MOE receiver caused severe
performance degradation because of extreme sensitivity to
CFO. In addition, the MOE receiver failed to produce a
reliable performance even in the CFO-free case, i.e., ǫ1=0.
This was because that the finite data sample effect induced
the correlation between signals, which led to desired signal
cancellation. The MOE and SMOE receivers with the CFO
estimator are able to offer a better performance again.
In the final set of simulations, the BER performance was
investigated by varying input SNR and the CFO values. Figure
6 showed the BER versus input SNR plot. As observed, the
proposed robust derivative constrained receiver can provide
much better performance in BER than conventional receivers,
which confirmed the advantage of the proposed scheme in
robustness as opposed to CFO and the finite data sample
effect. In addition, the BER versus CFO plot depicted in Fig.
7 indicated the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the
sensitivity in CFO again, especially for a larger CFO.
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, a robust derivative constrained receiver has
been proposed to alleviate the CFO effect. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed scheme with a performance similar
to the optimal one significantly outperforms the conventional
methods and achieves excellent robustness against CFO.
