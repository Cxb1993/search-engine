discretely distributed nano-dot could 
storage 2-bit data in one, i.e. improve 
double capability of storage. Therefore, 
it is interesting to study nonvolatile 
memory with nano-dots of the world. On 
the other hand, The electrical lines  
connecting chips, boards and systems 
will have difficulty keeping up with 
Moore’s law because that the ability to 
feed these chips with data is becoming 
limited. However, the benefits of optic 
links are well known. Recently a novel 
method has been proposed to achieve 
that an optically excited electron–hole 
pair in the nanocrystal can recombine by 
transferring energy to a rare earth ion. 
The latter is then excited from the 
ground state to the first excited state. 
Here atomic-scale engineering in 
combination with nanoscale energy 
transfer can lead to the development of a 
new class of miniature optical amplifiers. 
It is possible to fabricate light emission 
devices with cheaper Si substrate.

In order to improve the formation of 
imperfect-shaped nanocrystals 
aforementioned, a 5 nm a-Si layer was 
capped on WSix layer and followed 
oxidizing in the same conditions. The 
inset of Fig. 2(a) represents the HRTEM 
image of oxidized a-Si/WSix /SiO2 / Si 
structure. It displays that the WO3 /W 
nanocrystals were formed into 
distributed- and well-shaped ellipsoids. 
The confirmation of mean size of WO3 
/W nanocrystals is approximately 8.4 
nm in diameter. Figure 2(a) shows the 
density of WO3 /W nanocrystals versus 
rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) time. At 
initially 30 s, WO3 /W nanocrystals 
nucleated rapidly and sequentially 
coarsened. As RTO performed at 60 s, 
the density of WO3 /W nanocrystals 
decreases to 1.57 1011 cm−2, and there is 
no obvious variation from 60 to 120 s. 
The C-V characteristics of WO3 /W 
nanocrystals embedded in oxide are 
shown in Fig. 2(b). While the voltage 
swept from 1 to −5 V and back to 1 V, a 
threshold-voltage shift of 0.53 V was 
observed, this is sufficient to be defined 
as “1” or “0” for the logic-circuit design. 
XPS was used to determine the chemical 
nature of the a-Si/WSix /SiO2 / Si sample 
which was oxidized for 120 s RTO 
process. Ar sputtering for 100 sec is 
utilized for cleaning. Figure 3 presents 
the XPS spectra of W4f. The peaks 
centered at 3.14 and 33.4 eV were 
identified as W4f7/2 and W4f5/2, 
respectively. Slight WO3 chemical states 
were observed at 35.8 and 37.8 eV as 
well. Nevertheless, Si atoms in the 
sample are mostly oxidized, which the 
evidence is SiO2 signal identified from 
Si 2p XPS spectra. Because of extremely 
little solid solubility of O atoms within 
W material, O atoms could not exist in 
W nanocrystals except absolutely 
oxidation of tungsten. Therefore, it is a 
reasonable speculation that the position 
of WO3 should be on the surface of W 
nanocrystals. Namely, W nanocrystals 
are encapsulated by a very thin WO3 
layer. 
 
 
FIG. 2. (a) The variation of WO3 /W 
nanocrystals density vs RTO process time. The 
inset is the cross-section TEM micrograph of 
a-Si/WSix /SiO2 / Si structure for RTO treatment. 
(b) The capacitance-voltage(C-V) hysteresis of 
WO3 /W nanocrystals memory device.  
 
SiO2 layer also plays a significant role in 
keeping WO3 from evaporation. 
Capping a-Si layer onto W silicide 
before oxidation indeed results in perfect 
shape of WO3 /W nanocrystals. 
 
b) Cobalt-silicide nanocrystals 
in Ge-doped dielectric layer 
 
Experiment: Figure 1 exhibits the 
process flow in this work. First, a 
5-nm-thick thermal oxide was grown as 
the tunnel oxide on p-type Si substrate 
by dry oxidation in an atmospheric 
pressure chemical vapor deposition 
(APCVD) furnace. Subsequently, 
10-nm-thick Ge-doped cobalt silicon 
(Co-Si-Ge) layer was deposited by 
sputtering the Co and Si0.5Ge0.5 targets 
simultaneously. The DC sputter power 
of cobalt and Si0.5Ge0.5 are 50W and 75W, 
respectively. The process pressure was 
set at 7.6mTorr, which yielded a 
deposition rate of 0.03nm/s. Then a 
20-nm-thick capped oxide was deposited 
by plasma enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition (PECVD) before rapid 
temperature oxidation process. After the 
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in the O2 
ambient at 650 °C for 30 sec, the cobalt 
silicide nanocrystals were nucleated in 
the dielectric layer.. Subsequently, a 
30-nm-thick blocking oxide (SiO2) was 
capped by PECVD system. Finally, Al 
gate electrode was patterned and 
sintered. The structural analyses were 
performed by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). The 
capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
measurements were performed by an HP 
4284A precision LCR meter to study the 
electron charging and discharging 
effects of the cobalt silicide 
nanocrystals. 
 
 
FIG. 1. The process flow proposed in this work. 
 
 
Results: Figure 2 shows (a) the 
cross-sectional and (b) the plane-view 
TEM image of the fabricated device 
sample. It can be found that the average 
diameter of cobalt-silicide NCs is 
around 8–10 nm from the cross-sectional 
TEM image and the area density of NCs 
is estimated to be about 1.03x1011 cm−2 
from the plane-view TEM image. 
According the reported paper, the Ge 
elements tend to segregate at interface 
during the formation of the NCs. With 
the segregation of Ge elements, the 
component of NCs is nearly cobalt 
silicide. Moreover, according to the 
thermodynamic analysis, the Si and Ge 
elements are prior to be oxidized in the 
mixed film. Therefore, the 
cobalt-silicide NCs nucleate in the thin 
dielectric film mixed with silicon oxide 
and oxidized Ge elements.  
Figure 4 demonstrates the results of XPS 
analysis for Ge-doped cobalt-silicon thin 
film after thermal oxidation process. In 
Fig. 4(a), it can be found that the Co 2p 
XPS spectrum shows two peaks 
corresponding to cobalt silicide and 
cobalt oxide at 778.5 and 782 eV, 
respectively. The result indicates that 
cobalt-silicide NCs are formed and 
partly cobalt elements are oxidized to 
cobalt oxide during thermal oxidation 
process. Furthermore, the Ge 3d XPS 
spectrum is displayed in Fig. 4(b) which 
clearly indicates the peak at 32.5 eV. It 
is believed that the thermal oxidation 
process causes the formation of 
cobalt-silicide NCs and the oxidation of 
Ge elements. 
 
 
FIG. 4. (a) Co 2p XPS spectrum of the charge 
trapping layer after 650 °C thermal oxidation 
process. The main peak can be composed into 
two components which center at 778.5 and 782 
eV corresponding to cobalt silicide and cobalt 
oxide. b Ge 3d XPS spectrum of the charge 
trapping layer. The main peak at 32.5 eV can be 
assigned to the oxidation of Ge elements. 
 
c) Nickel nanocrystals with 
HfO2 blocking oxide 
 
Experiment: MOI capacitors were 
fabricated using silicon p-type wafers 
(100) orientation. First, the wafers were 
chemically cleaned by a standard Radio 
Corporation of merica cleaning. The thin 
tunnel oxide 3 (nm) was thermally 
grown at 1000 °C in vertical furnace 
system. Subsequently, a 3-nm-thick 
nickel layer was deposited onto the 
tunnel oxide by electron beam 
evaporation. The Ni wetting layer 
transformed the Ni nanocrystals after the 
rapid thermal annealing in the N2 
ambient at 500 °C for 60 s. A 
30-nm-thick blocking oxide (HfO2) was 
capped by sputter. The parameter of the 
high-k sputtering is 0.3 Å/ s as rf power 
sputter in 150 W under the working 
pressure of 20 mTorr. The flow rate of 
Ar/O2 is 20/5 SCCM (SCCM denotes 
cubic centimeter per minute at STP). 
The dielectric constant of HfO2 is 20. 
Finally, Al gate electrode was patterned 
and sintered. The structural analyses 
were performed by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). The 
capacitance-voltage(C-V) measurements 
are some leakage paths for the trapping 
charges, the memory effect will 
gradually decrease. In Fig. 3, the good 
retention characteristics can be found 
and the memory effect without 
significant decreasing up to 104 s. The 
charge loss rate only decreases to 
15.65% after 104 s. It is clearly shown 
that the Ni nanocrystal memory has 
excellent retention characteristic. 
 
 
 
FIG. 3. Retention characteristics of the Ni 
nanocrystal memory device at room temperature. 
 
The programing characteristics of Ni 
nanocrystals memory were studied by 
stressing samples with a pulse voltage of 
±5 V and a pulse width of 5 ms during 
programming and erasing (P/E). Figure 
4 shows the endurance characteristics of 
Ni nanocrystals memory after different 
stressing cycles at room temperature. 
The threshold voltage shift as a function 
of stressing cycles shows superior 
endurance. There was no degradation of 
the threshold voltage shift observed even 
after 106 P/E cycles.

nanocrystal memory device at room temperature. 
 
d) Co nanocrystal with HfO2 as 
blocking oxide 
 
Experiment:(100) oriented p-type silicon 
wafers were chemically cleaned by a 
standard Radio Corporation of America 
cleaning, followed by thermally growing 
of a 3 nm tunnel oxide at 1000 °C in a 
vertical furnace system. Subsequently, a 
3-nm-thick cobalt layer was deposited 
onto the tunnel oxide by electron beam 
evaporation. The Co nanocrystals were 
formed by rapid thermal annealing in the 
N2 ambient at 500 °C for 60 s. The 
30-nm-thick blocking oxide (HfO2) was 
capped by sputtering. Finally, Al gate 
electrode was patterned and sintered. 
The structural analyses were performed 
by transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM). The capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
measurements were performed by an HP 
4284A precision LCR meter to study the 
electron charging and discharging 
effects of the Co nanocrystals. 
 
Results: Figure 1 presents typical 
nanocrystals embedded in SiO2, a lower 
programming voltage of 5 V and erasing 
voltage of −5 V realize a significant 
threshold voltage shift, 1 V, which is 
sufficient to be defined as “1” and “0” 
by a typical sensing amplifier for a 
memory device.  
 
 
FIG. 2. (a) Capacitance-voltage (C-V) hysteresis 
of Co nanocrystal memory device after 
bidirectional sweeps between 5 V/ −5 V and 7 
V/ −7 V. (b) Band diagrams of the operation of 
the distributed charge storage with Co nanodots. 
 
The retention characteristics of the Co 
nanocrystals were measured at room 
temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. If there 
are some leakage paths for the trapping 
charges, the memory effect will 
gradually decrease. In Fig. 3, the good 
retention characteristics and the memory 
effect without significant decreasing up 
to 104 s can be founded. The charge loss 
rate only decreases to 21.95% after 104 
s. The inset shows that the threshold 
voltage shift does not significantly 
decrease after a long time 104 s. It is 
clearly shown that the Co nanocrystal 
memory has excellent retention 
characteristic. 
 
 
FIG. 3. Data retention characteristics of the Co 
nanocrystal memory device. 
 
In addition, the reliability of the memory 
device was also investigated. As shown 
in Fig. 4, the data endurance of the Co 
nanocrystal memory device retains an 
obvious memory window of 0.86 V after 
106 cycles and write/erase voltage was 
5/ −5 V. The good endurance behavior 
of the Co nanocrystal memory device 
can be founded. 
 
 FIG. 1. Plane-view and cross-sectional (inset) 
TEM analyses of Mo nanocrystals embedded in 
SiOx. 
 
To investigate the chemical composition 
of oxygen incorporated Mo silicide layer 
after annealing, the XPS analyses were 
performed by using an Al K (1486.6 eV) 
x-ray. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the 
XPS Mo 3d and O 1s corelevel spectra, 
respectively. The Mo 3d spectra of 
asdeposited sample show Mo–Mo and 
Mo–O bonds indicating the existence of 
metallic Mo and Mo oxides that 
correspond to various oxidation states 
Mo6+, Mo5+, Mo4+, andMo3+. The 800 
°C annealed samples also contain 
metallic Mo and Mo oxides, but the area 
of Mo–O bonds is less than that for 
as-deposited sample in Fig. 2 (a). After 
the 900 °C annealing, there is only 
metallic Mo in the oxygen incorporated 
layer, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The XPS 
Mo 3d shows that the Mo oxides were 
reduced as the annealing temperature 
was increased. In Fig. 2(b), the O 1s 
spectra of as-deposited and 800 °C 
annealed samples show Mo–O and Si–O 
bonds. The XPS peak of Si–O bond for 
as-deposited sample is less than 533.4 
eV the binding energy of SiO2, which 
indicates that the oxide around Mo 
nanocrystals is deficient (SiOx, x＜2) in 
the oxygen incorporated layer. There are 
only Si–O bonds, and the peak position 
of Si–O bonds shift toward higher 
binding energy for the sample after 900 
°C annealing. According to literature, 
the increment of O 1s binding energy is 
attributed to the oxygen bonding with 
deficient silicon oxide. The XPS results 
show that a redox between MoOx and 
SiOx occurred during the thermal 
annealing process. For the redox 
behavior in the oxygen incorporated Mo 
silicide layer, we consider that the 
formation energy of Si oxide (−750 
kJ/mole) is larger than that of Mo oxide 
−450 (kJ/mole). Therefore, the oxygen 
of Mo oxides prefers to bond with Si 
than Mo during the thermal annealing at 
900 °C, which results in the reduction in 
Mo oxide and improved the quality of 
SiOx.  
 
Figure 3 shows the comparison of the 
C-V curves for the 800 and 900 °C 
annealed samples. The curves were 
obtained after the gate voltage swept 
from inversion to accumulation region 
of the substrate from 9 to −11 V and 
the reverse from −11 to 9 V. The 
hysteresis loop of the samples is 
counterclockwise due to substrate 
injection through the tunnel oxide. We
