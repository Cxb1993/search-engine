control scheme using a small disturbance linearizing method and feed forward decoupling 
control concept for the VSPC to improve the dynamic performance of power systems with the 
aim of reducing the inevitable interactions between the active and reactive power flow control 
at the specific operating point is presented in the following subsections. 
 
z Modeling and Analysis of a VSPC Controlled Power System 
 
The equivalent circuit of a VSPC and a two-bus power system is shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, 
the series and shunt converters are represented by voltage sources, seV  and shV , respectively. 
By observing Fig. 4, the VSPC regulates the power flow by adjusting magnitude, seV , and 
phase angle, seδ , of the injected voltage. In the Fig. 4, the SSV δ∠  is the voltage phasor of 
the sending end, the RRV δ∠  is the voltage phasor of the receiving end and the phase angle at 
this point is assumed to be 0. The transmission line is modeled as a combination of two 
resistances with the same value of R, and two inductances X1, X2.  
 
The dynamic characteristic of the ideal series converter (or shunt converter) is determined 
by the resistance, R, and reactance, jX, of the transmission line. Since the reactance of a power 
transmission line is usually much larger than the resistance, the interaction between the series 
and shunt converters is quite strong which means that the series (or shunt) controller could 
cause large disturbances to the shunt (or series) converter. These kinds of disturbances can 
greatly degrade the performance of the series and shunt controllers and even cause instability 
of the total VSPC system even though the individual series or shunt controller is stable. 
Therefore, in the following simulation studies, the selection of resistance and reactance 
selection for the transmission line is very important to reduce the interaction between the two 
converters. A transmission line with various impedance selections and their influences on 
decoupled power flow controller in control performance are presented in the section of results 
and discussions of this report. 
    
   For simplicity, the resistance and inductance of the series transformer of the VSPC is 
ignored in this study case. Furthermore, the nonlinearities caused by semiconductor device 
switching, transformer saturation and controller time delays are all neglected in the model. It 
is also assumed that the transmission system is symmetrical.

    From Eq. (1) ~ (6), it can be found that by controlling the voltage, jjV δ∠ , at node j , 
the active and reactive power of transmission line can be controlled, while the voltage 
amplitude, iV , of node i  and VSPC DC link voltage, cV , can be controlled by shshI δ∠ . 
 
z Develop the Series Converter Control Scheme of VSPC  
 
   The series converter of the VSPC mainly deals with the power flow control in the power 
system and it performs the main control functions of a VSPC. Theoretically, the proper control 
of series converter can be achieved using P-Q decoupled (forward-feed) control means. The 
inputs and outputs of the control system are respectively the power flow control commands 
and a set of the inverter modulation index and phase shift parameters. 
     
From the Eq. (1) ~ (3), the jP  and jQ  can be controlled by adjusting seseV δ∠ . The 
phasor diagram analysis is show in Fig. 6. The voltage, jjV δ∠ , can be controlled by 
regulating the real component, sedV , and imaginary component, seqV , of the series converter 
voltage.

By analyzing the above Eq. (23) and (27), obviously, the same coupling problems exist in 
the control loops of reactive power flow and the DC link capacitor voltage which are 
accomplished by simultaneously regulating active and reactive current components. Thus, some 
kind of decoupled control means will be needed to obtain a satisfactory control performance. 
 
By observing Eq. (12) and (18), the reactive power, Qj , at node j is affected by both Vjd 
and Vjq. In order to control the active power and reactive power independently, a feed forward 
decoupling control scheme is developed as shown in Fig. 7. In the control scheme a reference 
model with a rise time is 0.1 second is used. The compensation value, Q∆ , that is introduced 
by means of the feed forward controller to compensate the effect of Vjq, from the reactive 
power of the system. Therefore a decoupled control characteristic on the specified operating 
point is achieved. The compensation of Q∆  is the feed forward gain:

By observing Eq. (23) and (27), a decouple control scheme can be developed for the 
system. A decoupled of controller for controlling both the DC interface and system voltages is 
also given in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, the compensations of iV∆  and the dcV∆  are the feed forward 
gains:

shunt branch or both to achieve a desired effect on the power flow transmitted between two 
busbars in which the UPFC is connected. In this sub-section, the development of Variable 
Structure Power Controller (VSPC), based on the basic UPFC configuration, is further used to 
provide flexible, simultaneous and real time control of the transmission parameters with a 
real-time variable control structure and system ratings. Theoretically there are a number of 
feasible solid-state implementations of the above mentioned VSPC; however, when practical 
implementation is considered the feasibility of circuit configuration, the control algorithm for 
a specific operating mode, the availability of high capacity power electronics, and most 
importantly the economical factors must also be taken into account. 
   Firstly, in order to achieve the purpose of capability transfer between the series and shunt 
branches of a VSPC, a number of small converter modules must be designed for the series and 
shunt converters. The conceptual control capability transfer diagram is shown in Fig. 9. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 9 The possible capability transfer diagram of VSPC 
 
z The Feasibility of VSPC 
 
   For the sake of simplicity, a feasible VSPC using two set of multiple modules (n=2) of 
voltage sourced three-phase inverters operated from a common DC link capacitor shown in 
Fig. 1 has been developed as the prototype of a VSPC in this project for investigating the 
possible control modes, capabilities, and the derivation of its mathematical models for further 
studies. The same as a conventional UPFC, a VSPC can be treated as a universal power flow 
controller with its rating and structure variable. Therefore, a VSPC has the flexibility to 
control either its series branches or shunt branches or a combination of them to achieve an 
optimal effect on power system parameters and cost effective installations.

B. The Simulation Results of VSPC Control Capability Analysis 
 
To investigate the feasibility and performance of a VSPC, Fig. 12 and 13 shown a set of 
simulation results concerning the voltage and P-Q control capabilities of VSPC with the 
rating of 1x shunt converter of VSPC, the system bus voltage can be improved to 0.9 pu 
during a fault. When the series converter capacity is fully transferred to the shunt converter 
and the shunt converter capacity becomes double. This enables the shunt branch of VSPC to 
have better voltage control performance. The controlled results are shown in Fig. 14 and 15. 
As can be seen in Fig. 14, with 2x shunt converter ratings, the system bus voltage can be 
improved up to 0.956 pu during the dip duration. Fig. 15 shows the corresponding changes of 
reactive power.

Figure 19 shows the attainable control region of P-Q power flow by a VSPC with a given 
branch number and the rating of each branch unit. It is quite obvious that when the series 
converter capacity is enhanced the circular area of controllable power flow is enhanced 
accordingly.

The research tasks planned for this project have been finished.  Comprehensive computer 
simulations and analysis on controllers for various control scenarios have been carried out. 
Satisfactory results of the planned research tasks have been obtained as expected. Some of the 
related research results have been prepared in four papers. Three of them will be presented in 
the related international conferences in 2006 ( one paper in IASTED_PEA 2006, Boswana, 
one paper in UPEC 2006, Northumbia, UK, one paper in IECON2006, Paris, France) 
and a full paper concerning the new D-Q decoupled control scheme using VSPC has been 
submitted to the International Journal of EPES for review.  Two research papers with more 
detailed version of the above conference papers are in preparation status and to be submitted 
to the international journals of IEEE_PD for review.
