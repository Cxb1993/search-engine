Abstract 
A. This study investigates in vitro the drug delivery characteristics of new 
thermo-sensitive gels, P-CS/GA gels, in which a chitosan (CS) network is 
crosslinked with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde (GA) that 
interpenetrates Poloxamer (P) gels. The results indicate that the swelling ratios 
of all P-CS/GA gels are markedly superior to those of non-swelling P and P-CS 
gels. For example, P-CS/GA (0.1 wt.%) gels have swelling ratios of 13.2±1.0, 
which are maintained for approximately 18 h in water at 37 ◦C. In vitro releases 
of 5-FU from P-CS/GA (0.1 wt.%) gels had significantly lower initial burst 
release (P < 0.01) and lasted much longer than those from gels without a CS 
network. For example, the duration of release of 5-FU was in a significantly 
sustained manner for up to 52 h, which was about 10 times or longer than the 
period of delivery using P or P-CS gels. The release of drugs from gels with an 
interpenetrating CS network could be modeled by Fickian diffusion; the 
characteristic constant „k‟ of drug–gel systems decreased as increasing GA 
concentrations in the P-CS/GA gels, and increasing the viscosities of the P, 
P-CS and P-CS/GA solutions.  
B. This investigation examines the in vitro release of insulin in new 
thermo-response P-CS/GA/Gly gels, in which a chitosan (CS), crosslinked 
using glutaraldehyde (GA), interpenetrates Poloxamer (P) gels, and glycine 
(Gly) is further added to inhibit the crosslinking reactions of GA. The delivery 
of insulin by nasally administering P-CS/GA/Gly gels in diabetic rats was also 
examined. The release of insulin from P-CS/GA/Gly gels was significantly 
sustained (P < 0.01) for about six times longer than release from P gels. The 
mechanisms of the release of insulin from the gels were consistent with a 
Fickian diffusion model. The nasal administering of insulin using P-CS/GA/Gly 
gels in diabetic rats is associated with a greatly prolonged hyperglycemic effect 
and a pharmacological efficiency (involving the maintenance of the lowest 
possible blood glucose levels (Cmin, 55.5±2.8% of original values, n = 6) for 3 
h, with a pharmacological efficiency of 18.0±1.8% (n = 6)) that significantly 
exceeded those achieved using other gels.

1. Introduction
Poloxamer block copolymers comprise various poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) blocks arranged
in a tri-block polymer structure, PEO–PPO–PEO. Since Poloxam-
ers comprise various numbers of hydrophilic PEO and relatively
hydrophobic PPO copolymers, various segments of copolymers
in aqueous solution interact and aggregate to form micelles
(Dumortier et al., 2006; Ruel-Gariepy and Leroux, 2006). At a suf-
ﬁciently high concentration and temperature (higher than LCST,
lower critical solution temperature), the Poloxamer micelles pack
in an order that results in a transition of sol to a gel state called
thermo-sensitive gel (Juhasz et al., 1989; Liu and Chu, 2000;
Dumortier et al., 2006; Ruel-Gariepy and Leroux, 2006). Numerous
researchershaveexamined the thermo-sensitivity of Poloxamer (P)
gels with an interest in their potential use in various pharmaceuti-
cal applications (Liu and Chu, 2000; Amiji et al., 2002; Roques et al.,
2007; Caffaggi et al., 2008). For example, injecting Paclitaxel loaded
Poloxamer 407 (20%) into a tumor positively inhibits tumor growth
(Amiji et al., 2002). Poloxamer 407 has also been employed as a car-
rier for the intra-pericardial administering of plasmid DNA in gene

therapy (Roques et al., 2007). However, P gels such as Poloxamer
188 and 407 generally sustain the release of drugs for only a short
period (such as <5h) in an aqueous environment (Barichello et al.,
1999; Jeong et al., 2002; Ricci et al., 2005), since P gels dissociate
rapidly in (such an OR an aqueous) environment. Various chemi-
cal modiﬁcations of Poloxamer (Cho et al., 2003; Sosnik and Cohn,
2004; Chung et al., 2005), such as amine-termination or grafting
of hyaluronic acid or chitosan to mono-carboxyl Poloxamers, can
reduce the critical gelation concentration and the dissolution rate
in aqueous solution (Cho et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2005). The devel-
opment of a modiﬁed P gel which may reduce the dissolution rate
but improve the sustained release of drugs is of interest.
Chitosan (CS), an amino polysaccharide (poly-1,4-d-
glucosamine) has been extensively applied in drug delivery
and tissue engineering (Lanza et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2004;
Chung et al., 2008). The cationic property of chitosan has been
utilized to deliver hydrophilic drugs such as tissue plasminogen
activator and insulin to substrates that carry negative charges,
such as the ﬁbrin network and mucosa surfaces (Lanza et al.,
2000; Chung et al., 2008). Furthermore, CS has abundant reactive
amine groups that can be crosslinked by various agents, such as
glutaraldehyde, to generate a network to promote the sustained

3. Results
3.1. Effect of GA concentration on thermo-sensitivity of P-CS/GA
gels
The LCST of thermo-sensitive P gels depends on the ratio of
P407 (or F127) to P188 (or F68) in the gel (Dumortier et al.,
2006). In this investigation, the P solution comprises F127/F68
(18wt.%/15wt.%), yielding an LCST value of 34.5 ◦C. The LCST value
of the P-CS gelswas only slightly affected by the lowconcentrations
of CS, such as 0.3–2.0wt.% (data not shown). In contrast, adding
GA (0.05–0.10wt.%) to P-CS solutions (such as with 1.0wt.% CS)
would ﬁnally transform the P-CS/GA solutions to a non-thermo-
sensitive gels at LCST after a period of time. Additionally, adding
high concentrations of GA to P-CS solutions shortened the period
forwhich the thermo-sensitivity of the P-CS/GAgels could bemain-
tained. Based on our tests, the thermo-sensitive characteristics of
P-CS/GAsolutions/gelswith0.05and0.10wt.%GAweremaintained
for approximately 40 and 20min, respectively, at 25 ◦C.
Fig. 1a schematically depicts the P/CS solutions. The crosslink-
ing reactions between CS and GA in P-CS/GA solutions are assumed
to form a CS crosslinked network (Fig. 1b). CS polymers or CS solu-
tionsat ahighconcentrationemitbroadﬂuorescencewhen theyare
excited by light with a particular wavelength. However, the emis-
sion of ﬂuorescence by P-CS gels could not be observed using a
laser confocal microscope (data not shown). Interestingly, P-CS/GA
gels emit green ﬂuorescence, and ﬂuorescent images of entangled
CS polymers or CS network-like conﬁgurations formed within the
gels were captured as viewing angles of 0◦ and 90◦ (Fig. 1c and d).
Moreover, the thickness of the entangled region of CS polymers or
the CS network-like conﬁgurations formed in the gels is approxi-
mately 18.68m. The formation of an interpenetrating CS network
in P-CS/GA gels (Fig. 1) might change their ﬂow and drug release
properties.
3.2. Effects of interpenetrating CS network on viscosities of
P-CS/GA solutions
The viscosities of the P and P-CS solutions were about constants
at various shear rates (data not shown), suggesting that their rhe-
ological behaviors are Newtonian ﬂuids (Dumortier et al., 2006) at
a tested temperature. Moreover, the viscosity of the P-CS solution
increases with temperature in amanner that is similar to the rheo-
logical behavior of the P solution (data not shown) (Dumortier et al.,
2006). For example, the viscosities of the P-CS solution increased
from 145.0 through 350.0–448.1mPa as temperature of the solu-
tion increased from 25 through 32–34.5 ◦C (at LCST of the P-CS
gel). Fig. 2 presents the viscosities of P-CS and P-CS/GA solutions
at 30 ◦C with various concentrations of GA measured from 60 to
900 s. Interestingly, at 30 ◦C, the viscosity of the P-CS solution was
approximately three times that of the P solution, possibly because
the entangled CS polymers (Fig. 1c) would hinder the ﬂow of
micelles in the P-CS solution. The viscosities of the P-CS/GA solu-
tions increased with time, and the rates of increase of viscosities
were positively correlated with the amounts of GA in the solutions
(Fig. 2). For instance, the viscosities of the P-CS/GA solutions of 0.05
and 0.1wt.% GA were 408.4 and 425.5mPa, respectively, at 60 s,
increasing to 463.4 and 575.4mPa at 600 s (Fig. 2). According to
the principles of chemical reaction kinetics, either prolonging the

3.5. Diffusion mechanisms of 5-FU from gels
According to the best ﬁtting for the release of 5-FU presented

drug-loaded P, P-CS and P-CS/GA gels with various concentra-
tions of GA. Moreover, Table 1 presents the ‘k’ value for each gel.
Moreover, to examine the possible correlation between the ‘k’ val-
ues of gels and viscosities, , of P, P-CS and P-CS/GA solutions
in Fig. 2, the regression line of ‘k’ values versus  (the  values
at 900 s of Fig. 2) were calculated. Interestingly, the regression
line was ‘k’ = 15.7–2.0×10−2 × , with a correlation coefﬁcient, R,
about 0.96, indicating that the release characteristics of the gel
decreased with increasing the viscosity of the correspondent solu-
tion.
4. Discussion
Systems that provide the sustained release of drugs are receiv-
ingmuch attention from the pharmaceutical industry because they
provide several advantages over conventional drug delivery sys-
tems. These systems may prolong drug action, reduce side effects
and reduce the frequency with which drugs need to be admin-
istered. Numerous pharmaceutical researchers are interested in
various potential applications of drug delivery using thermo-
sensitive P gels (Liu and Chu, 2000; Amiji et al., 2002; Roques et al.,
2007; Caffaggi et al., 2008). However, P gels such as Poloxamer 188
and 407 generally sustain the release of drugs for a short period in
an aqueous environment (Barichello et al., 1999; Jeong et al., 2002;
Ricci et al., 2005) because Poloxamer gels dissociate rapidly in an
aqueous environment. The maximum duration of drug release is
typically limited by the inﬂux of water into the P gels, which dis-
solves the gel. The objective of the newly developed P-CS/GA gels
is to reduce the rate of dissolution and prolong the 5-FU release
period.
4.1. Fluorescent images of interpenetrating CS networks in
P-CS-GA gels
Reactions between the amine groups of CS and the aldehyde
groups of GA are well known to occur in P-CS/GA solutions (Wang
et al., 2008), forming an assumed CS-crosslinking network (Fig. 1b).
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no microscopic image of
the assumed interpenetrating CS networks in gels has been pre-
sented. Thiswork providedﬂuorescent images of the entanglement
of CS polymers at different viewing angles (0◦ and 90◦). They had
a thickness of approximately 18.68m. They partly depicted the
entanglement of CSpolymers or theCSnetwork-like conﬁgurations
that formed within P-CS/GA gels (Fig. 1c and d). In contrast, no ﬂu-
orescence was observed from P-CS gels without GA crosslinking
reactions under a laser confocal microscope (data not shown). The
ﬂuorescent images partially revealed the presence of a CS network
in the P-CS/GA gels that strongly inﬂuenced the characteristics of
the release of 5-FU from the gels (Figs. 4 and 5). This crosslinked
network may become denser as the crosslinking time increases. As
the transition from a solution to the gel state occurs at LCST, the
crosslinked CS network interpenetrates the P-CS/GA gels, prevent-
ing the aggregates of P micelles or P gels from being broken down
to form free Pmicelles when the temperature is below LCST, ﬁnally
losing the thermo-sensitivity of the gels. To avoid any possible dif-
ference between the thermo-sensitive and non-thermo-sensitive
P-CS/GA solutions, thermo-sensitivity was maintained while the
viscosity was being measured.
4.2. Interpenetrating CS network affects viscosity and swelling
ratios of P-CS/GA solutions and gels
The increase in the viscosity of the P-CS/GA solution may have
been caused by the formation of the CS network within it, which
hindered the ﬂow of the solution (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a higher
concentration of GA in P-CS/GA solutions was associated with the
formation of a denser CS network, possibly because of higher reac-
tion rates, and therefore, a markedly increasing resistance to the
ﬂow of the solutions, which is responsible for a considerably high
viscosity of them (Fig. 2).
Grafting carbohydrates, such as hyaluronic acid or chitosan onto
amine-terminated or mono-carboxyl Poloxamers, can reduce the
critical gelation concentration and the dissolution rates of the gels
in aqueous environments (Cho et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2005).
Covalently crosslinking ethoxysilane-capped PEO blocks of Polox-
amers also prevents the rapid dissolution of gels in water (Sosnik
and Cohn, 2004). In this work, without the aforementioned sophis-
ticated chemical modiﬁcations, the dissolution times of P-CS/GA
gels in aqueous environments were signiﬁcantly longer than P gels
(Fig. 3). The high swelling ratios of GA-containing gelsmay be asso-
ciated with the CS network that interpenetrates the gels, and binds
the aggregated P micelles/gels in compartments during hydration,
thereby preventing the rapid dissolution of the gels.
4.3. Sustained release of 5-FU from P-CS/GA gels
The durations of the release of 5-FU in P-CS/GA gels (Fig. 4)
exceeded those in chitosan-basedor other thermo-sensitive hydro-
gels under similar release conditions in an in vitro investigation

This investigation examines the in vitro release of insulin in new thermo-response P-CS/GA/Gly gels,
in which a chitosan (CS), crosslinked using glutaraldehyde (GA), interpenetrates Poloxamer (P) gels,
and glycine (Gly) is further added to inhibit the crosslinking reactions of GA. The delivery of insulin by
nasally administering P-CS/GA/Gly gels in diabetic rats was also examined. The release of insulin from
P-CS/GA/Gly gels was signiﬁcantly sustained (P<0.01) for about six times longer than release from P
gels. The mechanisms of the release of insulin from the gels were consistent with a Fickian diffusion
model. The nasal administering of insulin using P-CS/GA/Gly gels in diabetic rats is associated with a
greatly prolonged hyperglycemic effect and a pharmacological efﬁciency (involving the maintenance
of the lowest possible blood glucose levels (Cmin, 55.5±2.8% of original values, n=6) for 3h, with a
pharmacological efﬁciency of 18.0±1.8% (n=6)) that signiﬁcantly exceeded those achieved using other
gels.

1. Introduction
Chitosan (CS), an amino polysaccharide (poly-1,4-d-
glucoamine) has been extensively applied in drug delivery and
tissue engineering (Chung,Wang, & Tsaia, 2008; Kumar, Bakowsky,
& Lehr, 2004; Lanza et al., 2000) because of its non-toxicity and
biocompatibility. CS exhibits a positive potential in weak acid
buffer solutions, which has been exploited to deliver proteins or
DNA (Chung et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2004; Lanza et al., 2000).
The cationic property of chitosan has been exploited to deliver a
tissue plasminogen activator to substrates of the ﬁbrin network
or insulin to mucosa surfaces (Chung et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2004).
The nasal delivery of insulin using chitosan solutions has been
demonstrated to increase greatly trans-mucosal absorption in rats
and sheep (Illum, Farraj, & Davis, 1994; Yu et al., 2004). A formula
that contained 1% chitosan and 5% hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin
(HP--CD) for nasal insulin delivery was recently explored
(Yu et al., 2004).Poloxamer block copolymers comprise various
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) blocks
that are arranged in a tri-block polymer structure, PEO/PPO/PEO.
Since Poloxamers comprise various numbers of hydrophilic PEO
and hydrophobic PPO copolymers, various segments of copoly-
mers interact and aggregate into micelles in aqueous solution

(Dumortier, Grossiord, Agnely, & Chaumeil, 2006). At sufﬁciently
high concentrations and temperatures, Poloxamer micelles pack
in an order that results in a transition of the sol to the gel state
(Dumortier et al., 2006; Juhasz, Lenaerts, Raymond, & Ong, 1989;
Liu & Chu, 2000), in which they are the so-called thermo-response
gel. The sol–gel property of Poloxamers is of particular interest
to numerous researchers who have examined their potential use
in various pharmaceutical applications (Amiji, Lai, Shenoy, & Rao,
2002; Caffaggi et al., 2008; Liu & Chu, 2000; Roques, Salmon,
Fiszman, Fattal, & Fromes, 2007). For example, Poloxamer 407 has
been applied as a carrier for the intra-pericardial administering
of plasmid DNA for gene therapy (Roques et al., 2007). However,
as a drug carrier, Poloxamer gels typically sustain the release of
drugs for a short period (such as <5h) in an aqueous environ-
ment (Barichello, Morishita, & Nagai, 1999; Jeong, Kim, & Bae,
2002; Ricci, Lunardi, Nanclares, & Marchettia, 2005), since packed
Poloxamer micelles dissociate rapidly in an aqueous environment.
Although several chemical modiﬁcations of the Poloxamer (Cho
et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2005; Sosnik & Cohn, 2004), including
amine-termination or the grafting of hyaluronic acid or chitosan
to mono-carboxyl Poloxamers (Cho et al., 2003; Chung et al.,
2005), can reduce the critical gelation concentration and disso-
lution rate in aqueous solution, a simple method that, unlike the
aforementioned approaches, does not require complex chemical
modiﬁcations of Poloxamers to reduce the dissolution rate and
improve the sustained-release characteristic of drugs, is sought.

Industries Inc., USA) and suspended in vials that contained 30ml
of distilled water as the dissolution medium. The vials were shaken
at 60 rpm at 37 ◦C (Chung et al., 2009). 0.5ml of the dissolution
medium was periodically withdrawn to determine the insulin con-
centration using the Brandford method using a UV spectrometer
(Jasco-530, Kobe, Japan) (Wu et al., 2007). The dissolution medium
was replacedwith an equal volumeof freshmedium following each
withdrawn.
Although many simple mathematical models describe the
release of drugs from swellable polymeric systems, including gels
(Peppas, Gurny, Doelker, & Buri, 1980; Ritger & Peppas, 1987), none
completely predicts all associated experimental observations. Gen-
eralized empirical equations, including a power law model, have
been extensively adopted to evaluate the release of drugs from
swellable systems (Ritger & Peppas, 1987). In this study, the empir-
ical power law equation, Eq. (1), is employed to analyze the release
of insulin from gels with various formulations:
Mt
M∞
= ktn (1)
where Mt/M∞ is the fractional release of the drug at time t; ‘k’ is
the characteristic constant of the drug-gel systems, and ‘n’ is the
diffusion exponent that characterizes the release mechanism. The
equation applies until 60% of the drug has been released and effec-
tively describes the release of the drug from discs of gels and other
swellable materials, as well as that from non-swellable matrices.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the mechanism of the release of
insulin from each gel, k values were calculated using Eq. (1).
2.3. In vivo evaluation of effectiveness of nasal administering of
gels in diabetic rats
MaleWistar ratswereobtained fromtheAnimal Center of Taipei
Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. They were housed individually
in wire-bottomed stainless steel cages in an air-conditioned room
(21±2 ◦C, 50–70% relative humidity) with a 12h light–dark cycle
and free access to the basal diet and water for one week before
diabetes was induced.
All experimental procedures that involved the animals followed
the guidelines of the National Science Council of Taiwan and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. The details of the proce-
dure for inducing diabetes in rats can be found elsewhere (Chen &
Cheng, 2006). Brieﬂy, ratsweremade diabetic by intra-peritoneally
administering streptozotocin (STZ, 45mg/kg BW, in 0.9% sodium
chloride solution) and injecting them 15min later with nicoti-
namide (200mg/kg BW) solution. These steps were then repeated
two days later. A rat was identiﬁed as diabetic when its fasting
plasma glucose level exceeded 10mmol/l (or 1.8mg/ml) after the
administering of streptozotocin (Chen & Cheng, 2006). Only dia-
betic rats with plasma glucose levels from 2.0mg/ml to 5.0mg/ml
were used.
Diabetic rats (250–300g) fasted for 24h before the experiments
were conducted, but were allowed free access to water during that
time. They were divided into ﬁve groups of six rats each, and anes-
thetized using gaseous ether. One group was the control group
while the other four groups were the nasal delivery groups. At
the beginning of each experiment, the initial blood glucose level
of the rats was determined and designated as the reference level
at zero time, 100%. The rats in the control group were subcu-
taneously injected (sc) with insulin (1.0 IU/kg) solution. 30l of
insulin-free P-CS solution, and solutions of 10 IU/kg insulin in P,
P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly were loaded into separate micropipettes for
nasal administering to the rats of the fournasal delivery groups. The
solutionswere administered into onenostril of each rat by carefully
inserting amicropipette 3–5mm into the nasal cavity. 200l blood
samples were taken from the tail vein at 0.5h and every half hour
between 1 and 8h following dosing. The glucose levels in the blood
were determined by the glucose oxidase method using a glucose
kit; glucose in blood reacts with an enzyme to produce a number of
electrons that is correlatedwith the glucose level in theblood (Chen
& Cheng, 2006; Krauland et al., 2006). For this work, the 200l
blood samples from the rats were placed on a strip that was coated
with the enzyme glucose oxidase for subsequent measurement of
the glucose concentration using a blood glucose meter (One Touch
blood glucose meter, LifeScan Inc., a Johnson & Johnson Company,
Milpitas, CA, USA). The areas over the glucose level/time curves
but below the baseline, deﬁned as AOC, were calculated using the
trapezoid rule. AOC is an index of the deviation of blood glucose
level from the baseline. The relative pharmacological efﬁciency (Fr)
was calculated using the following equation (Krauland et al., 2006;
Wu et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2004):
Fr (%) = AOCnasal/Dosenasal
AOCsc/Dosesc
× 100
All of the calculations were made using Sigmastat statistical
software (Jandel Science Corp., San Rafael, CA, USA). Student’s t-
test and ANOVA with a conﬁdence level of at least 95% were used
to determine statistical signiﬁcance (P<0.05). Data were measured
at least in triplicate and presented as mean± standard deviation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermo-responses of P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly gels
The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of Poloxamer
thermo-response gel depends on the ratio of P407 (or F127) to P188
(or F68) in the gel (Dumortier et al., 2006). In this work, the P solu-
tion comprised F127/F68 (18%/15% in wt %), yielding an LCST value
of 34.5 ◦C. The small amount of CS only slightly changed the LCST
value of the P-CS gels. For example, the LCST value of the P-CS gels
with 1% CS was around 33.5 ◦C, which was 1 ◦C lower than that of
P gels, perhaps because the CS may be present outside the packed
micelles of the Poloxamer gel, since no speciﬁc interaction occurs
between CS and Poloxamer polymers (Fig. 1(a)). The effect of GA
concentration in P-CS/GA gels on its thermo-response is examined
(Chung et al., 2009). The adopted concentrations of GA and Gly in
P-CS/GA/Gly gels herein sustained their thermo-responses for over
0.5h at 25 ◦C.
3.2. Rheology of P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly solutions
The viscosities of P-CS/GA solutions at a ﬁxed temperature are
reportedly a function of time, whereas that of the P-CS solution is
constant (Chung et al., 2009). The viscosity of P-CS/GA/Gly solution
is also a function of time, as is that of P-CS/GA solution, but that
of the latter is higher and rises more quickly than that of the for-
mer (515.6±0.7 and 575.4±0.3mPa, respectively, at 10min and
30 ◦C). Interestingly, at a give temperature (30 ◦C), the viscosity of
the P-CS solution (300.0mPa) was approximately three times that
of the P solution, possibly because the tangled CS polymers hin-
dered the ﬂow of micelles in the P-CS solution (Chung et al., 2009).
Table 1 presents the percentage increases in the viscosities of P, P-
CS and P-CS/GA/Gly solutions with temperature from 25 to 35 ◦C,
which is approximately the LCST of the P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly
gels. The viscosities of P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly (0.1% GA) solutions
rise with temperature in a similar manner up to approximately the
LCST of each solution (Table 1). Hence, large changes in viscosities
of P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly solutions were observed as the measur-
ing temperaturewas increased toapproximately the corresponding
LCST (34.5, 33.5 and 32.5 ◦C, respectively). For example, the viscosi-
ties of the P-CS solution increased from 145.0 to 448.1mPa as the

of insulin from P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly gels.
3.5. Mechanisms of diffusion of insulin from gels
According to the best-ﬁt for the release of insulin in Fig. 3a, the
‘n’ value in Eq. (1) in Section 2 is 0.5. Fig. 3b plots Mt/M∞ versus t0.5
for the fractional release of insulin from drug-loaded P, P-CS and P-
CS/GA/Gly gels. Moreover, the ‘k’ values of P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly
gels were 12.3, 11.9 and 3.6×10−2, with a correlation coefﬁcient of
over 0.99. The ‘k’ values for the release of insulin from P and P-CS
gels herein were approximately equal to those of 5-FU in an earlier
investigation (Chung et al., 2009), suggesting that the hydrophobic
or the hydrophilic property of the drugs only weakly inﬂuenced
their in vitro release in this system. Interestingly, for a particular GA
content in thegels, the ‘k’ value for P-CS/GA/Glywas lower than that
for P-CS/GA (Chung et al., 2009), revealing the effect of adding Gly
on the GA and CS crosslinking reactions. Additionally, according to
an investigation of 5-FU delivery in a similar gel, the ‘k’ value for the
release from the gel declines as the viscosity of the corresponding
solution increases (Chung et al., 2009). Since the viscosity of the P-

3.6. Hypoglycemic activity of insulin-loaded P-CS/GA/Gly nasal
gels in vivo
The hypoglycemic activity that is associated with the nasal
delivery of insulin using P, P-CS and P-CS/GA/Gly gels in diabetic
rats was examined. Rats that were injected subcutaneously (sc,
1.0 IU/kg) with insulin comprised the control group, with an Fr
value of 100%. In this study, the dosages of insulin thatwere admin-
istered to the rats by subcutaneous injection or nasal delivery were
similar to those employed elsewhere, although different carriers
were used (Barichello et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2004).
The blood glucose levels of rats following the nasal administering
of insulin (10.0 IU/kg) using variously formulated gels, and those
of the control group, were monitored (Fig. 4). Animals to which
insulin had been administered nasally using only P or P-CS gel
exhibited no reduction in blood glucose level (Fig. 4). The blood
glucose concentration in the rats in the sc (or control) group was
the lowest (Cmin, 36.3±3.4% of original values, n=6) 1h after the
insulin was administered; this concentration had returned to its
original level at 5h. The proﬁle of the blood glucose level of the
rats to which insulin had been administered nasally using P gel,
was similar to that of the sc-injected rats, but with a lag of 0.5h;
their Cmin (45.4±2.2%, n=6) was reached 2h after the insulin was
administered. The rats to which insulin had been nasally adminis-
tered using P-CS gels reached Cmin (48.5±2.0%, n=6) 3h thereafter,
and the Cmin state lasted for about 1h; the glucose concentration
returned to the original level a little more slowly than in the sc
group. Notably, the rats to which insulin had been nasally admin-
istered using P-CS/GA/Gly gels reached Cmin at 2h, and this Cmin
state) (55.5±2.8%, n=6) lasted for 3h, although the rate at which
the glucose concentration returned to its original level was similar
to that in P-CS gels. Moreover, since the Cmin state lasted for 3h, the
blood glucose level of the group towhich insulin had been adminis-
tered using P-CS/GA/Gly gel was signiﬁcantly lower (P<0.01, n=6)
than that of other groups between 4h and 8h. The pharmacological
efﬁciency (Fr) of the insulin that was nasally delivered using P, P-
CS and P-CS/GA/Gly gels was 9.3±0.9%, 13.6±1.8% and 18.0±1.8%
(n=6), respectively, calculated with reference to the results for the
