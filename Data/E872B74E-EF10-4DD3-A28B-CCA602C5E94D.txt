英文摘要 
A p-type SiGe double-quantum-well 
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor 
has been fabricated and characterized. The upper 
quantum well with 15%-Ge acts as an 
induced-carrier buffer to slow holes into the Si 
surface channel and increases the number of 
high-mobility holes in the 30%-Ge well at the 
bottom under high gate voltage by improving 
carrier confinement. DQW devices with a 
thinner Si-spacer layer between the two SiGe 
quantum wells exhibit an improved effective 
hole mobility and wider gate voltage swings but 
also reduced 1/f noise levels than Si-controlled 
pMOSFETs. The DQW has an enhanced carrier 
confinement compared to a single quantum-well 
(SQW) device; however, the degradation of 
mobility and transconductance observed in a 
sample DQW indicates that this poor transport 
mechanism may result from an additional hole 
scattering effect at the Si/SiGe interface. 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Methods of optimizing channel mobility 
need to be explored in order to overcome the 
limitations on the scaling down of devices and 
further improve the speed of complementary 
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits. A 
promising candidate to answer this demand is 
compressively strained SiGe material for use in 
Si-based technology. By means of performing 
band engineering, SiGe p-type 
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect 
transistors (pMOSFETs)1-4) have been shown to 
exhibit higher channel mobility and better charge 
carrier confinement than their bulk Si 
counterpart. The higher channel mobility of this 
device arises because the holes are confined well 
in buried SiGe quantum wells with potential 
higher mobility, and therefore carrier scattering 
at the SiO2/Si interface is reduced. Hence, this 
material offers the possibility of improved 
pMOSFET performance and may have direct

performed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 
900°C for 30 s in order to activate the dopants. 
Finally, contact-hole etching, metal 
deposition/patterning, and 450°C post-metal 
annealing were performed to complete the 
fabrication of the device. 
The samples were characterized by an 
on-wafer test using an HP-4156C semiconductor 
parameter analyzer and HP-4284A precision 
LCR meter for DC measurement. The 1/f noise 
was measured by a Stanford Research SR570 
low noise current amplifier with an HP-35670A 
dynamic signal analyzer. The effective hole 
mobility effμ  determined by a split C-V method 
is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Effective hole mobility as a function of 
gate bias for all devices using a split C-V 
method. 
Obviously, all SiGe devices have higher 
effective hole mobility than Si-control devices. 
Unfortunately, DQW samples have a lower hole 
mobility than sample SQWs. It seems probable 
that more interface roughness due to the two 
additional sides of the Si-SiGe interface8) 
contributes to the degradation of carrier mobility. 
A DQW device with a thinner spacer has a 
higher hole mobility than a device with thick 
spacer. 
To provide more physical insight for this 
increase in effective mobility, an integrated 
system engineering (ISE) simulation has been 
conducted, and the results of the calculated 
carrier distribution for all DQW devices at VGS 
-VT = -1 V are shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, a 
greater improvement in mobility for device 
DQW-A may be attributed to more carriers being 
well confined in the main Si0.7Ge0.3 conducting 
channel. Consequently, the promise of higher 
transconductance and higher current driving 
capability for device DQW-A has been obtained.

Figure 3 shows the output current-voltage 
characteristics of DQW devices. All devices 
have a gate length and gate width of 0.6 and 25 
μm, respectively. Compared to the Si-control 
devices, higher drain currents ID are obtained for 
DQW devices. The transconductance, measured 
at VDS = -0.1 V versus gate voltage overdrives 
TGS VV −  for the DQW devices with various 
Si-spacer thickness are shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, 
a wider gm distribution was observed in SiGe 
DQW devices compared to the sample SQW, 
and Si control and gm increases with decreasing 
Si-spacer layer thickness. We consider that the
