1. Introduction 
      Glucosamine (GlcN) and N-acetyl 
glucosamine (GlcNAc) are readily 
synthesized in the body from glucose and also 
act as precursors for biosynthesis of the 
classes of compounds including glycolipids, 
glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans (also 
called mucopolysaccharides), hyaluronate, 
and proteoglycans. As a component of these 
macromolecules, GlcN has a role in the 
synthesis of cell membrane lining, collagen, 
osteoid, and bone matrix. GlcN is also 
required for the formation of lubricants and 
protective agents such as mucin and mucous 
secretions. Because of its high concentration 
in joint tissues, the hypothesis mentioned that 
GlcN supplements would provide 
symptomatic relief for osteoarthritis has been 
developed more than 30 years [2]. As the 
body ages, it would lose its ability to produce 
the GlcN. It will lead to the reduction of the 
cartilage flexibility and susceptible to injury.  
Furthermore, individuals with arthritis 
typically have faster rate of cartilage 
breakdown and slower rate of cartilage 
production. To offset these effects, GlcN is 
widely taken as supplement in an effort to 
provide more cartilage building blocks to the 
body and relief of ostheoarthritis pain. 
      Presently, most of GlcN is derived from 
the exoskeletons of shellfish [3]. The 
exoskeletons of shellfish that contain chitin 
are hydrolyzed by hydrochloric acid solutions. 
There are several limitations of the production 
of shellfish derived GlcN  using this method, 
such as : 1) Those that are allergic to shellfish 
may try to avoid shellfish derived GlcN, 2) 
Environmental contaminant such as heavy 
metals that may be concentrated in shellfish 
and retained in the GlcN and becomes toxic to 
consumers, 3) Harvesting time of shellfish is 
seasonal, and it will lead to significant vary of 
its price and availability, 4) The  harvest of 
shellfish from the world’s seas and oceans 
may contribute to depletion of the world’s 
marine resources.  Some GlcN supplement 
users may consciously choose not to 
contribute for this depletion. 
      Considering several factors limited the 
production of GlcN from shellfish (marine 
sources) and presents studies of production 
GlcN using microorganisms, this study used 
microorganisms (fungi) to produce GlcN 
cultivated in submerged fermentation and 
obtain the optimum medium compositions for 
production of GlcN using Aspergillus sp. 
BCRC 31724. 
  
２．Motivation and Objective 
      Several studies have been reported on the 
production of GlcN using microorganisms, 
 8 
interfere compound was 0.1% wt. These 
chemicals were derivatized and then 
introduced to HPLC with the same protocol as 
that of GlcN hydrochloride. The selectivity 
was evaluated through the peaks appear in the 
HPLC chromatogram. 
3.1.3 Precision and accuracy of calibration 
curve 
Precision and accuracy of the calibration 
curve were determined by intra analysis of 
several GlcN solutions with different 
concentrations. Two different weight 
concentrations of D-(+)-GlcN hydrochloride, 
99% in purity (0.06%, 0.10%) and one 
concentration of GlcN commercial product 
(0.08%) were prepared. Those samples were 
analyzed triplicates after derived by 
derivation agent. Precision was represented as 
relative standard deviation (% R.S.D) and the 
accuracy by relative error (% R.E). 
3.1.4 Effects of pressure disruption and 
hydrochloric acid concentration (N) 
      For studying the effect of pressure 
disruption, 1 g of wet fungi were disrupted 
with selected pressures, such as 0, 10, 20, 30, 
40 kpsi by using a high-pressure homogenizer 
(Constant, England). Hydrochlorination using 
2, 4 and 6 N HCl for 4 h at 100oC by thermal 
method (Enshine 1600 watt, Japan) and also 
by microwave synthesis of 100% level 
(SunHow 1400 watt, Taiwan) for 3 min (% of 
level means the electric power to be used to 
run the microwave). After hydrochlorination 
process, 10 mL of distilled water was added 
to the samples and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. 
3.1.5. Effects of microwave level for 
hydrochlorination process 
      Ten levels of the microwave oven 
(SunHow 1400 watt, Taiwan) can be utilized.  
Considering that hydrochlorination process 
needs high temperature, hence, this study 
using microwave only utilized 3 levels; 80%, 
90% and 100%. The calculation of GlcN 
content was identical to that used for the 
conventional thermal method.  
2.2 Effect of growth morphology, agitation 
rate and stimulating factor on the 
glucosamine production using 
Aspergillus sp BCRC 31742  
3.2.1 Microbial fermentation 
      Aspergillus sp BCRC 31742 was 
purchased from Bioresource Collection and 
Research Center (BCRC) in Taiwan. The 
strain was cultured on potato dextrose agar 
(PDA, Difco) slants and incubated at 30oC for 
7 days. After that, the spores were collected 
and suspended with distilled water and 
transferred quantitatively to a potato dextrose 
broth (PDB) medium (4.8 g/L) and incubated 
at 30oC and 200 rpm for 7 days.  The spores 
with mycelia, clumps and pellets were 
preserved by putting 0.5 mL culture 
suspension from PDB into 0.5 mL glycerol 
and stored in a freezer at -80oC till used again. 
Fermentation was carried out by putting 10% 
(v/v) of small pellets fungi into a glucose 
peptone medium containing superior white 
 10 
pressure value will cost more energy.  The 
phenomena of pressure disruption is also 
affected by the concentration of HCl utilized 
in hydrochlorination process.  Small amount 
of wet cell will be easily to be hydrolyzed by 
      Higher HCl concentrations will strongly 
hydrolyze the fungal GlcN straightly into 
GlcN hydrochloride with or without 
disruption, but if using lower HCl 
concentrations, longer hydrochlorination time 
will be needed.  Considering all these, 
pressure disruption would not be utilized in 
the system. 
4.1.2 Effect of hydrochloric acid 
concentration  and time for 
hydrochlorination  
      The reaction factors for hydrochlorination 
are energy, diffusion or convection.  Because 
shaking was not used in this method (static 
oven or microwave), the reaction factor was 
mostly affected by diffusion.  A small amount 
of wet cell will be easily hydrolyzed by high 
concentration of acid.  Figures 3 and 4 show 
the effects of hydrochlorination acid 
concentration and time for determining fungal 
GlcN content using thermal method and 
microwave method, respectively.  Lower HCl 
concentrations (2 N, 4 N) could not hydrolyze 
all of the fungal GlcN to GlcN hydrochloride 
for the given hydrochlorination time, as 
reflected by lower GlcN content if compared 
to that of higher HCl concentration. The best 
concentration of HCl was 6 N to hydrolyze 
fungal GlcN.  The hydrochlorination 
processes only took 4 h and 3 min for thermal 
method and microwave method, respectively.  
Microwave accelerated reaction rate and 
shortened the reaction time significantly and 
utilized the high heat source to hydrolyze the 
fungal GlcN.  This time consumption was 
lower than that reported by Hsieh et al [6].  
The maximum GlcN content of Aspergillus sp 
BCRC 31742 obtained using thermal method 
was 0.22 g/gdw cells and was same with 
microwave method. 
 
4.1.3 Effect of microwave level for 
hydrochlorination process 
Microwaves are electromagnetic energy, 
which is converted into heat by mutual 
interactions between media (the electric field 
component of the wave with charged particles 
in the material) [8].  Level of microwave will 
straightly affect the heating temperature.  This 
study used a microwave oven made in Taiwan 
(SunHow 1400 watt, Taiwan).  Three levels 
of microwave were analyzed (80%, 90%, 
100%).  The % of level means the electric 
power to be used to run the microwave, such 
as 1,400 watt; 1,260 watt; 1,120 watt for 
100%, 90%, 80% of the level, respectively.  
The results are shown in Figure 5. Low 
heating temperature (<80% of level) is not 
suitable to hydrolyze the biomass of fungi.  
Cao et al [9] reported the suitable 
hydrochlorination temperature of fungal 
 12 
differences among those diameter ranges in 
order to enhance fermentation performance. 
There were two dependent variables were 
evaluated, biomass (CDW) (g/L) and GlcN 
concentration (g/L). It was found that only the 
diameter of 1.2-1.6 mm is significantly 
different at P<0.05 level to produce biomass 
(g/L) as compared to the control (diameter of 
1.3-3.6 mm). For GlcN concentration itself, 
the diameter of 1.4-2.9 mm was significantly 
different from control (1.3-3.6 mm). 
Representative figure to depict the statistical 
analysis between two dependent variables of 
fermentation as the effect of different 
diameter ranges can be seen in Figure 7. 
4.2.2 Effect of fermentation volume and 
agitation rate 
Flask system has several weaknesses, 
such as the pH is not controlled during the 
fermentation, the oxygen transfer capability of 
shake flask is poor due to lack of adequate 
mixing and considerable evaporation can take 
place during shake flask culture cultivation 
due to respiration of the microorganism [12]. 
According to the study conducted by Shuler 
and Kargi [13], in batch system, working 
volume of the reactor affects the performance 
of the fermentation results. The phenomena 
can be explained by the maintaining process 
of homogeneity, changes in surface to volume 
ratios in large scale system. Hence, for 
enhancing the growth of biomass, T-flask 
type was used to run the fermentation in order 
to reduce oxygen transfer limitation and 
inadequate mixing of the system. Different 
fermentation volumes and agitation rates were 
studied and the results are shown in the 
Figure 8. The best fermentation volume to run 
fermentation was 50 mL in the T-flask (250 
mL) and was shaken at 200 rpm. The GlcN 
concentration could achieve up to 7.05 g/L 
with a biomass concentration of 35.68 g/L. 
Higher fermentation volume seemed to reduce 
the biomass. It is well-known to be 
understood that different agitation rates will 
affect both fungal morphology [14] and mass 
transfer phenomena in the bioreactor of a 
submerged fermentation [15]. Addressing on 
this approach, a fungal fermentation needs a 
high agitation rate to provide adequate mixing 
and reduce mass transfer limitation, especially 
when the fungal cells grow in a freely 
dispersed form, which results in a non-
Newtonian broth and a high apparent 
viscosity [16].  
From Figure 8, low agitation rates (150 
rpm and 175 rpm) were not suitable for the 
growth of the fungi and resulted in a low 
biomass concentration. It happened as the 
effect of low oxygen transfer from the 
medium to the cells. However, due to high 
intensity of agitation rate (225 rpm) would 
increase the mechanical damage to the pellets. 
In this study, because of a low value of 
fermentation volume, a high agitation rate 
caused the fungi to anchor on the wall of the 
shake flask and also led to a low 
concentration of biomass after fermentation. 
 14 
by a derepression of dormant, subapical sites 
at different points in the hypha. But in our 
system, addition of cycloheximide did not 
give any stimulatory effect on the GlcN 
concentration as compared to the control. 
However, it still could increase the GlcN 
content up to 0.24 g GlcN/gdw cells when the 
optimum cycloheximide concentration (10 
μg/mL) added to the fermentation medium. 
4.2.4 Effect of Addition Time of Different 
Stimulating factors 
Different addition times were taken into 
account affecting the production of GlcN 
using Aspergillus sp BCRC 31742. Four 
stimulating factors were still employed in the 
system, at their optimum level, such as 
glutamic acid (0.50 g/L), cycloheximide (10 
μg/mL),  methanol (1.50% v/v) and ethanol 
(1.50% v/v). The results are shown in Figure 
9. For each stimulating factor, addition at the 
beginning of fermentation was found to be the 
best addition time. For addition of glutamic 
acid, addition at 48 h gave the highest 
biomass (26.47 g/L), but the content was low 
(0.24 g GlcN/gdw cells), and the GlcN 
concentration could only reach 6.32 g/L, 
which was not as high as that obtained with 
an addition time of 0 h. The same 
phenomenon also happened in the addition of 
methanol and ethanol. The maximum GlcN 
concentration were 7.43 g/L and 7.04 g/L, 
respectively for methanol and ethanol at 0 h 
addition time. Addition of methanol at 36 h 
after the inoculation was also found to 
increase the GlcN concentration up to 7.21 
g/L. Cycloheximide did not show any positive 
stimulatory effect on the production of GlcN. 
The maximum GlcN concentration could 
achieve 6.19 g/L with a biomass of 25.72 g/L. 
Wild-type fungi seem to be promising 
microorganisms as compared to genetic 
engineered microorganisms on the production 
of GlcN, as genetic engineering processes 
need more attenttion, time and cost to be 
developed. Several studies have been reported 
on the production of GlcN using wild type 
fungi (Table 3). Most of them used wild type 
fungi of Ascomycotina (Aspergillus sp) and 
Zygomycotina (Rhizopus sp, Mucor sp) 
subdivisions. Productivity is the most 
important parameter for scalling up the 
production of GlcN because it relates to the 
cost expenditure. Reduction in incubation 
time of fermentation will lead to the 
increasing of productivity and saving more 
energy. This study was successfully reduce 
the fermentation time from 7 days 
fermentation [1,6] into 5 days fermentation. 
Therefore, from Table 4 over all results 
reported in this study are the highest 
glucosamine production, particularly in the 
parameter of productivity using wild-type of 
fungi even compared to our previous study 
[1,6].  
4.3 Separation and Purification Technology 
Separation proces is started with 
hydrolysis process of fungal biomass. Fungal 
biomass resulted from fermentation is treated 
 16 
were 7.07 (± 0.10) g/L and 7.07 (± 0.04) g/L 
for glutamic acid and ethanol, respectively. 
Addition of cycloheximide did not give any 
stimulatory effect on the production of 
glucosamine. These findings need to be 
applied and verified in the large scale 
operation of stirred tank fermenters. For 
separation and purification processes, the 
purity of GlcN could be obtained was 94.1% 
with the recovery of 20%.
