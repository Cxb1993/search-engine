執行情形: 本案第三年研究工作為銅銀粒子的合成研究與其熱處理
行為。主要研究內容及成果如下: 
 
一、奈米銀銅粒子的合成部份 
1-1 奈米銀粒子的合成 
利用化學還原法合成粒子，以對環境無毒害的弱還原劑葡萄糖為還原劑，實
驗中並加入鹼劑氫氧化鈉及尿素，調控環境的 pH 值反應液中加入保護劑，實驗
採用高分子 PVP 作為保護，以控制粒子的大小與粒徑分布。實驗控制於 85±2℃
的環境下反應，以利反應的進行（圖一）。反應過程中，銀的前驅鹽會先與弱還
原劑葡萄糖產生氧化還原作用，先還原出銀粒子；而後續再加入銅的前驅鹽，希
望能夠藉由銀的存在，而促使銅藉由異相成核的方式成長於銀粒子上。所以會先
略加探討銀粒子的形成，接著再探究銀銅複合粒子的產生。而一開始討論的合成
條件先以 NaOH / AgNO3 = 0.6，為當量點的 40%（當量點：NaOH/AgNO3=1.5），

pH 達到平衡一段時間後，後續的 pH 值逐漸下降，推測造成此現象的原因
是由於溶液中的 OCN－水解出的 CO3

OH

混合，溶液中的銀離子瞬間被消耗後，後續維持穩定的值。從圖中可推斷溶液中
已有 40%－50%的銀離子已形成銀的混合物。

1-2 奈米銀銅粒子的合成 
生成銀粒子的溶液，此時再加入硝酸銅後進行 2 小時的反應，讓溶液中過量
的葡萄糖還原出粒子。以前趨鹽 Ag：Cu=50：50 的條件為例，反應後的情況發
現（圖八 a、b），反應中 UV-vis 的最大吸收峰會產生紅位移的行為，且提高添加
高分子 PVP 的量，其紅位移的量較大，且吸收峰有變寬廣的趨勢。從溶液的外
觀即可發現，加入少量的保護劑，最後得到的溶液顏色為黃色；而增加 PVP 含
量，使最後的溶液為紅棕色，暗示著溶液中的銅大量地被還原出來。 
改變不同的前趨鹽含量，將最後得到的粒子做 UV-vis 的分析（圖九），可發
現吸收的最大峰亦隨著銅前趨鹽的含量提高而往長波長移動。( Xcu=1 時，波長
為 574nm，參考文獻：Curtis et al., 1988 )藉由原子吸收分析儀 AAS 的量測（圖
十），可推算得知粒子中的元素含量，從圖可發現不論銀銅的前驅鹽比例為何，
只要增加 PVP 的量，皆可以使得最後得到的粒子元素比與原先的添加量相近，
搭配著圖，更容易了解此情形。另一方面，可發現的現象是銅前趨鹽的量加得越
多，相對保護劑 PVP 的量不需要加得太多，就可得到使溶液中的銅被大量還原
出來，如圖九中的 A 點的 Xcu 值與 B 點接近（在 0.4~0.5 之間），但 A 點
（PVP/(AgNO3+Cu(NO3)2)=2.5g/1g）使用 PVP 相對於前趨鹽的含量就比 B 點
（PVP/(AgNO3+Cu(NO3)2)=20.0g/1g）低。也就是提高 PVP 或是銅前趨鹽的含量，
都能使最後粒子中銅的含量增加。從以上觀察可推測 PVP 與銅離子之間有錯合
鍵結作用，如圖十一所示，使得加入越多的 PVP，有助於降低銅離子轉化成元素
銅的能量，影響了銅的還原電位，因而達到預期的條件。

確實具有銀銅兩成份的存在，即可確定合成出來的粒子為銀銅複合粒子。因此，
只要改變前驅鹽的比例與保護劑的含量，最後可以得到想要的奈米銀銅粒子，亦
可獲得銅高於 50wt%的奈米銀銅複合粒子，即達到原先設定的目標。

利用 XPS 分析粒子表面的成分，一方面可分析銀銅成分，另一方面可以得
知經過熱處理時，粒子表面銅生成氧化銅的情形。做出來的粒子，從全圖譜（圖
十五）可發現粒子表面含有銅，銀兩成分，因而可推斷出粒子是以銀為核，銀銅
混合生成為殼的複合粒子。當加溫到 150℃時（圖十六 a），粒子的表面仍維持銅
的特徵峰，表示在此溫度下銅仍然穩定；接著加熱至 200℃後（圖十六 b），粒子
表面氧化銅的特徵峰逐漸生成，300℃更加明顯。因而可推測粒子經過受熱處理
後氧化的過程：粒子在 200℃的環境下表面開始氧化，而加熱到 300℃時從 XRD
顯示出仍含有銅的特徵峰，暗示銅氧化仍只於表面；溫度提高至 350℃時，XRD
已經呈現氧化銅的特徵，表示著粒子氧化的程度已經深至內層，使得銅的特徵不
復在。

ABSTRACT 
 
A process window for the synthesis of Ag wires through the polyol process 
is established, in which a long and uniform size of silver wires is obtained. The 
formation of decahedral seeds (leading to the formation of wires) is in 
competition with ordinary seeds (becoming spherical colloids) and 
heterogeneous nucleation and deposition on vessel walls. All of the various 
processes are in turn influenced by the supply rate of silver from reduction 
reactions. Adding silver nuclei before the reduction reaction could effectively 
decrease the wire diameter. 
 
 
 
 
Keywords: silver wire, polyol process, process window;  
Many articles can be found in the literature on the synthesis of silver wire 
using the polyol method. For example, Sun et al. used Pt as seeds to grow 
silver wires and discussed the effect of Pt seed concentration on the product 
[13]. Later, the effects associated with varying PVP amounts were also 
reported [14]. Chen et al. tried to synthesize silver wires of different diameters 
by introducing certain control agents such as KBr, KOH and Fe(NO3)3, etc. into 
the polyol process [15]. However, most of these articles reported on only one 
operational condition pertaining to the silver ion concentration, feed rate, 
reaction volume and temperature in an effort to obtain the desired product. 
When one tried to change, for example, the silver concentration, or feed rate, 
the products often changed from pure wires to mixtures of wire and spherical 
particles. To the best of our knowledge, as of yet there have been no process 
windows reported on in the literature. Therefore, this study is aimed at 
establishing such a window in terms of the reaction temperature, feed rate and 
silver concentration required for the successful synthesis of silver wires. By 
exploring different synthesis conditions, we wish to identify the key elements of 
the process. This should prove beneficial to the scale up in terms of getting 
sufficient quantities of silver wire for application studies.  
Experimental 
In a typical synthesis, magnetic stirring is maintained during the entire 
experiment. PVP (unit M.W.=111, Showa, Japan) whose quantity is kept at 1.5 
times the molar ratio of [Ag+] throughout this work, is first dissolved in 20ml 
anhydrous ethylene glycol (99.5%, Scharlau, Spain) (called solution A) in a 
250ml two-necked flask and then refluxed at various temperatures for 30 min; 
silver nitrate (Kojima, Japan) of differing amounts, i.e. 0.255, 0.51 and 1.02g, 
into the reaction vessel, the solution temperature dropped immediately, 
especially at higher feed rates, and then increased gradually as indicated in 
Fig. 3. The temperature increased to the set value when the feed was 
completed (indicated by an arrow in the Fig. 3). Under these conditions, the 
solution was clear of any precipitates within 2 hours of reflux. The precipitates 
appeared only after long periods of reaction and were all spherical colloids 
(case 1 in Fig. 1b). Regarding the true reaction temperature, the reduction rate 
for silver ion was probably too slow to produce the necessary decahedral 
seeds. After long periods of reaction and the accumulation of silver clusters, 
spherical particles were formed instead.  
At higher reaction temperatures, e.g. 158-159℃ and 162-163℃, pure 
silver wires were obtained using varying feed rates and silver ion 
concentrations.  For cases 2 and 3, when the feed rate (volumetric feed rate x 
silver ion concentration) was high (i.e. ~ 2.5 x 10-4 mole/min), the high reaction 
temperature and high silver concentration helped to quickly produce many 
nuclei and then went directly to the formation of spherical colloids. When the 
feed rate was reduced to around 1.5 x 10-4 mole/min, more silver wires were 
found in the product at 158-159oC (case 6), and pure silver wires at 162-163oC 
(case 5). Comparing these two conditions, competitive processes between the 
formation of decahedral seeds (leading eventually to wires) and ordinary 
seeds (leading to spheres) seemed to exist. Interesting enough, at a feed rate 
of 0.5 x 10-4 mole/min, pure silver wires were obtained at 158-159oC (case 8), 
but not at the higher reaction temperature of 162-163oC (case 7). The range of 
successful synthesis of silver wire shifted to higher feed rates at a higher 
reaction temperature. This seems to suggest that the supply of silver atoms 
[14,16]. Clearly both results are consistent with our findings.  
As an attempt to control the wire diameter, we tried to put a few silver 
nuclei (size less than 10 nm) into solution A before feeding the AgNO3 solution. 
During the heating period, the color changed correspondingly with the 
dissolution of original small colloids and the possible recrystallization into 
decahedral seeds and then grew into wires as more AgNO3 was fed into the 
system (feed rate at 0.6 x 10-4 mole/min; final silver concentration 0.05M, 
reaction temperature at 158-159oC). The wires thus obtained are shown in Fig. 
5, in which the diameter was estimated to be around 60 nm. By putting more 
nuclei in the beginning and thus limiting the process to a growth process, we 
can decrease the wire diameter.  
Conclusion 
In conclusion, we have established a process window for the successful 
synthesis of silver wire with long and uniform size via the PVP 
polymer–mediated polyol process. The results are presented as the rate of 
accumulation of silver in the system as functions of time. The formation of 
decahedral seeds is a necessary step for the formation of wires. Yet, it is in 
competition with processes such as the formation of ordinary seeds, 
heterogeneous nucleation or deposition on vessel walls. All of the above 
processes are influenced by the rate of supply of silver from the reduction 
reaction and hence it is also very sensitive to the reaction temperature. The 
silver wires obtained in this study are 300  30 nm in diameter and up to 50 m 
in length. By adding small silver nuclei prior to the feed of AgNO3, we 
demonstrated the possibility of obtaining wires with smaller diameters.

chosen in the study for its low cost and good chemical resistance to the plating 
solution. Adhesion between deposited film and substrate is a problem in most cases. 
Therefore, some kind of pretreatment is required [4-8]. In some cases, a chemical 
reagent can be found which chemically binds to both the substrate and the deposited 
film. There is also the physical method that incorporates roughening the surface [9-11], 
which was adopted in this work. O2 plasma treatment is one of the most wildly used 
techniques in surface modification. When the energetic active species of the plasma 
collide with the PET surface, some of the chemical bonds will break making the 
surface more active, besides, the plasma can increase the roughness of the polymer 
film. Therefore, it was used to improve wettability and the adhesion of coatings to 
metals and polymers. Other methods, the wet blasting technique and 
Corundum-blasting technique that used in the plating industry to improve the 
adhesion of the coating layer are also used in this study.  
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 PET film Surface treatment  
The PET film (A4, 100μm, SCHMIDT) has very smooth surface. Adhesion of any 
deposited material to PET substrate was very poor. It was therefore proposed to 
physically roughen the surface. The first method used here is O2 plasma surface 
treament. The O2 plasma treatment is a general method to increase adhesion of metal 
to polymer substrate. It not only enhances chemical interactions between metal and 
polymer surface but also increase the surface roughness of substrate[12], The O2 
plasma at the power 200W, the O2 flow rate of 35 sccm and the working pressure of 
250 mTorr. The treatment time was kept at 2 minutes. The second method is the wet 
blasting technique which can make rougher surface than that plasma done, the 
blasting media in this experiment is 10 μm Al2O3 powder (<10,Sigma-Aldrich, 
Germany ) mixed with DI water. Every PET film was wet blasted row by row, and this 
was repeated five times; the total treatment time for a PET sheet (A4 size) was 10 
minutes. The third method is Corundum-blasting technique which is commonly used 
in the plating industry. The blasting media, high purity alumina powder (Rich Sou Co., 
Taiwan), was sieved by 325, 240 and 120 mesh, and the respective average particle 
size was about 30, 60 and 100 μm. The working gas was compressed air at 7 atm. 
Every PET film was blasted row by row, and this was repeated three times; the total 
treatment time for a PET sheet (A4 size) was 5 minutes. After the blasting treatment, 
the PET films were cleaned using a 6M HNO3 solution to remove pollutants and then 
cleaned using DI water.

2.4 electric circuits patterning 
To make patterns of electric circuits, a plotter pen (0.18 mm, Mutoh, Japan) was 
filled with the silver ink as activator then used to draw electric patterns on the 
roughened PET substrate using a computer controlled plotter (DXY–1150, Roland, 
Japan) as shown in Figure 3. After drying, the electroless copper plating process was 
followed as mentioned above.

Figure 5 shows the water contact angles of the untreated and treated PET films. 
The results indicate that the PET film became more hydrophilic after the O2 plasma 
treatment, and the blasting treatment slightly change the contact angle. This 
characteristic is beneficial when the water based silver ink is applied to the treated 
PET film, the ink tended to maintain its line shape instead of shrinking.

Adhesion is a key performance requirement for copper on substrate materials. In some 
reports, excellent initial peel strength can be achieved by plasma treating the polyimide film. 
In order to improve the adhesion between the copper film and PET film the O2 plasma 
treated PET film was used as substrate, and the same copper plating process was 
applied, but unfortunately the plated copper film was like that on untreated PET film, 
after several minutes of the electroless copper plating process, most part of the copper 
film peeled. This result indicates that the adhesion strength contributed by chemical 
interaction and surface roughness was not enough to anti the stress that was built by 
copper grain growing. Another reason could be used to explain the poor adhesion 
strength. The activator used here, silver nanoparticles were stably dispersed by PVP, 
and the quantity of PVP in this experiment was about one to fifth of silver by weight. 
When the silver nanoparticle coated on PET film the surface will be covered by PVP 
and consequently the plated copper film can not contact with the plasma treated 
surface directly. This is a shortage to use the PVP dispersed silver ink as activator.    
 
Highly Roughed surface formed by wet blasting and blasting technique was used 
for electroless copper plating to get strong mechanical adhesion. After spin coating the 
silver nanoparticle active layer on the treated PET, a slight orange color layer was 
formed on the PET substrate; the image of the silver nanoparticles distribution on the 
wet blasting roughed surface was shown in figure 7. After electroless copper plating, a 
copper film was successfully deposited on the roughed PET film; the SEM image of 
the deposited copper film was shown in figure 8(a). A representative SEM picture of 
the deposited copper film is exhibited in Figure 8(b). In general, the copper deposits

The deposited copper adhered on PET film by the roughed surface. 
 
In Table 2, we summarized the results from this study. Clearly, more roughened 
surfaces lead subsequently to more roughened copper surfaces after the plating 
process. The copper films that deposited on 10μm alumina particle wet blasting 
treated PET film and 30μm alumina particle blasting treated PET film were still 
looked smooth and more acceptable than others.  
All the electric resistivity of these copper films was measured at about 1.9 x 10
-6
 
Ω-cm, which was very close to the bulk value of copper (at 1.71 x 10-6 Ω-cm at 25oC). 
The result indicates that the electric resistivity doesn’t seem to be strongly influenced 
by the roughness. 
Regardless of the differences in surface roughness, all these samples passed the 
normal adhesion test, instead of the copper film peeling, the adhesive tape was peeled 
from copper surface, therefore, stronger adhesive tape (4-1000, 3M, USA) was used, 
the result in table 2 showing peel adhesion strength between the copper film and wet 
blasting treated PET is 1.8kgf/cm and the values of other samples are greater than 2 
Kgf/cm, i.e. the strength of the 3M tape. Without the roughening process, deposited 
copper films peeled off easily from the substrate.

Finally, we demonstrate an RFID antenna on a flexible PET substrate in Fig. 11. The 
circuit pattern was first drawn on a 30μm alumina powder treated PET film surface by 
a computer-controlled plotter using a plotter pen filled with 0.25wt% silver ink. The 
resulting copper film was smooth and continuous, offering low electrical resistance 
for applications.

4. Conclusion 
In this work, we demonstrated a circuit forming process which utilized PET as the 
substrate. By roughening its surface with a 30 micron alumina particle, and patterning 
with silver ink which served as an activator for subsequent electroless copper plating, 
we could then produce sample circuits on flexible PET substrates. These circuits 
exhibited good electric conductivity and strong adhesion strength to the substrate, 
therefore offering great potential for industrial applications.
