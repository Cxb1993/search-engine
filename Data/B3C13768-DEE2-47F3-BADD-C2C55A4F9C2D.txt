ABSTRACT 
To find the opportunity of spectrum and to make good use of the spectrum resources are 
major challenges for future cooperative and cognitive radio networks (CCRN). Firstly, we 
proposed a Utility and Game Theory (UGT) based network selection scheme, which utilizes the 
cooperative network preference game and utility function to decide the most suitable candidate 
network. Simulation results show that UGT can achieve lower new call blocking rate and forced 
termination rate than iterative TOPSIS. Then a Fuzzy Active Period Adaptation (FAPA) scheme is 
proposed for Dynamic Spectrum Access in CCRN. The FAPA scheme can adjust active period 
instantaneously and effectively according the observed WLAN operation situations by using 
fuzzy logic. Therefore, FAPA algorithm can effectively reduce more idle time of the unlicensed 
spectrum than Fixed-AP method to fully utilize the unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show 
that the overall throughput of FAPA is better than Fixed-AP method by 15~20% of throughput 
improvement at low and medium traffic intensity. Otherwise, we propose Dynamic Priority 
Resource Allocation (DPRA) for uplink radio resource management in MIMO-OFDMA system. 
The DPRA originally designs a priority value for each service type according to the urgency and 
QoS requirements of the traffic and dynamically adjusts it frame by frame. By comparing with 
the conventional EFS algorithm, the simulation results have shown that the proposed DPRA 
scheme can reach throughput maximization and QoS satisfaction with a lower computational 
complexity and transmission overhead on the premise that the QoS requirement can be satisfied. 
Next, the Genetic Algorithm with SS Grouping Resource Allocation (GGRA) scheme has also 
been proposed for the MIMO-OFDMA system. With the design of the SS grouping, the GGRA 
scheme makes the adoption of the GA optimization technique computationally tractable and, thus, 
feasible in real-time applications. Simulation results show that the GGRA scheme performs better 
than the MLWDF and EFS schemes. Finally, the intelligent Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request 
(iHARQ) Scheme is proposed to achieve efficient resource utilization under the situation that 
CQI has report delay. With the combination of fuzzy logics and the QL algorithm, the QL 
algorithm is adopted to adjust the Q-values of fuzzy rules to adapt to channel conditions where 
reinforcement signals are well designed by using domain knowledge considering the results of 
both initial transmission and retransmission. The simulation results show that the iHARQ scheme 
guarantees the QoS requirement of BLER and attains higher system throughput than conventional 
HARQ schemes, such as the ATS scheme and the QL-based HARQ (QL-HARQ) scheme. 
In this project, we design several traffic scheduling and control schemes by using intelligent 
algorithms. On the premise that the QoS requirements are satisfied, we successfully improve the 
system throughput from different aspects, including (i) network selection and call admission 
control, (ii) dynamic spectrum access and white space detection, (iii) MIMO-OFDMA radio 
resource allocation and (iv) hybrid automatic repeat request. These proposed radio resource 
management technologies are essential to provide a QoS-guaranteed CCRN

for heterogeneous wireless access networks, where multiple classes of traffic and MS mobility 
are considered. The UGT scheme intends to maximize the accommodated number of calls, 
minimize handoff rate, and support QoS. After obtaining the candidate networks for the call 
request, the utility value of each candidate network would be calculated to represent the 
satisfaction of QoS requirements for a call request. The cooperative game is also adopted to 
calculate the preference value of each candidate network. Finally, the network with the maximum 
result of linearly combined utility value and preference value would be selected as the most 
suitable network for the call request. Simulation results show that UGT obtains lower new call 
blocking rate and fewer forced terminated calls. Besides, UGT reduces the handoff occurrence 
frequency about 30% than iterative TOPSIS. 
Current wireless networks are regulated with a fixed spectrum assignment policy, which 
leads to the inefficient spectrum usage. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a promising approach 
to alleviate the spectrum scarcity and fully utilize the unused radio source. By using DSA, 
secondary users can dynamically access same spectrums under tolerable interference to primary 
users. 
To perform DSA in coexistent networks, cognitive radio (CR) technology is the key 
technology. Based on the definition of CR mentioned in [6] and [7], we summarize two main 
characteristics for CR: cognitive capability and reconfigurability. Cognitive capability refers to 
the ability of the radio technology to identify the usage info of a spectrum at a specific time or 
location. Reconfigurability then enables CR system to dynamically program its radio access 
manner based on the decision of selected spectrum and operating parameters. 
In this paper, the interweave solution in [8] is mainly concerned for coexistence. That is, 
only the spectrums not in use by the primary owners called white space can be used for 
communication by secondary users. Consequently, the utilization of the spectrum is improved by 
opportunistic frequency reuse over the spectrum holes. Here, the most important issue is to design 
the spectrum sensing function to search the white space and decide the holding time for the CR 
users. Holding time refers to the expected time duration that the secondary user can occupy a 
band before getting interrupted. Obviously, the longer the holding time, the higher the efficiency 
would be. Since the fairness should put into consideration, frequent spectrum handoff can 
decrease the holding time and maintain the fairness. So we have to strike a balance between 
fairness and efficiency. 
Two mechanisms called Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) and Extended Quiet Period (EQP) were 
proposed in IEEE 802.16h [9] such that IEEE 802.16 system can coexist with existing systems in 
unlicensed band. An active period (AP) is set as the holding time for secondary users. In this 
paper, we try to adjust AP by an effective and intelligent way for performance improvement by 
using fuzzy logic theory. Fuzzy logic has broadly used in the up-to-date communication systems 
to mimic the operation of the human brain to solve problems with vague information [10]. It has

selecting a better channel for each SS, depending on the SS’s signal-to-noise ratio value [20]. 
However, the QoS requirements and power constraint are not considered. Furthermore, an 
efficient uplink resource allocation for power saving in IEEE 802.16 OFDMA systems was 
proposed in [21]. It adaptively adjusts the modulation and coding scheme to minimize the 
required transmission power while guaranteeing the BER. However, multiple services and their 
differentiated QoS requirements are not taken in account. 
In the aforementioned previous works, the QoS requirements and fairness issues are either 
omitted or simplified. A minimum required transmission data rate or a predefined weight that 
corresponds to the fixed priority scheme is usually adopted as the QoS requirements. However, 
with the provision of multimedia real-time traffic, the delay bound and the packet dropping rate, 
which is regarded as essential QoS requirements, should be included in the design of radio 
resource allocation for practical applications. Additionally, realistic traffic models and buffer 
conditions of different traffic types should be considered. Niyato and Hossain proposed a 
queue-aware uplink bandwidth allocation scheme for SSs with real-time polling service (rtPS) 
and non-real-time polling service (nrtPS) in IEEE 802.16 systems [22]. The bandwidth is 
allocated according to the channel quality and queue state of the traffic. 
Furthermore, the tradeoff between system performance and computational complexity is an 
important issue. The greedy algorithm that performs symbol-by-symbol allocation can achieve an 
optimal solution [23], but it results in high computational complexity. According to the frame 
structures of DL-MAP and UL-MAP defined in IEEE 802.16 for downlink and uplink, 
respectively, the symbol-by-symbol allocation algorithm costs high transmission overhead. In 
addition, most resource-allocation algorithms are designed for downlink and claimed to be 
compatible with uplink as well. However, the downlink frame structure (DL-MAP) and uplink 
frame structure (UL-MAP) are differently defined in IEEE 802.16 specifications [24]. Thus, an 
efficient and feasible resource allocation algorithm for either downlink or uplink needs to be 
specifically designed to meet its individual frame structures. 
In this project, we propose a dynamic priority resource allocation (DPRA) scheme for IEEE 
802.16 uplink communication systems. The goal of the proposed DPRA scheme is to maximize 
the system throughput while satisfying various QoS requirements of multimedia traffic. Four 
types of service traffic for users are taken into account, including unsolicited grant service (UGS), 
rtPS, nrtPS, and best effort (BE) service. A priority value for every service type of each user is 
defined and adaptively adjusted frame by frame according to its urgency related with individual 
QoS requirements and buffer condition. Then, the BS will dynamically allocate the uplink 
subchannel, modulation order, and power to each SS according to its priority value and the CSI. 
Furthermore, to meet the uplink frame structures defined in IEEE 802.16 specifications and 
reduce the computational complexity and the transmission overhead, a consistent allocation 
mechanism is designed in the proposed DPRA scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed 
DPRA scheme performs close to the optimal method, which is by exhaustive search, in system

increase in the number of users and antennas. However, it is designed for antenna selection only 
and lacks QoS requirement consideration. As a result, it is not suitable for systems that support 
multimedia traffic with QoS constraints. Singh and Sharma [19] proposed an efficient and fair 
scheduling (EFS) algorithm. This algorithm defines a fixed-priority allocation policy such that 
high-priority service with high-channel gain will be allocated first. This heuristic approach can 
achieve high system throughput and satisfy the QoS requirement in most cases. However, the 
fixed-priority allocation policy would lack flexibility. Park et al. [30] proposed an algorithm 
based on the maximum largest weighted delay first (MLWDF) algorithm, which can dynamically 
adjust the priority of unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), and 
non-real-time polling service (nrtPS) traffic. This algorithm can improve the QoS fulfillment and 
maintain the good performance. Both the EFS and MLWDF algorithms use the heuristic approach, 
which choose one SS at a time. The performance can be further improved if optimization 
techniques are used, which completely plan the allocation for the whole frame. 
An optimization technique that takes advantage of the nature behavior is called the genetic 
algorithm (GA). The GA is based on the nature of survival of the fittest. It randomly generates the 
population, using crossover and mutation methods, and evaluates chromosomes by a well-defined 
fitness function. It performs well for finding an optimal solution if a good convergence strategy is 
defined. Moreover, the computation time can be limited by setting an iteration upper bound. 
Therefore, it is helpful in many dimensions to solve the optimization problem. It is widely used in 
manufacturing problems such as job-shop scheduling or a flow-shop problem. There is also some 
GA applied in communications. Reddy et al. [31] proposed an efficient orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scheduling algorithm based on the GA to do the 
subchannel selection and power loading; Guo et al. [32] proposed an antenna-selection method 
based on the GA for MIMO systems. However, it is found that this previous research faces 
several problems, such as QoS requirement guarantee and computational tractability, while 
conforming to the IEEE 802.16 UL frame format. 
In this project, we propose the GA with SS grouping resource allocation (GGRA) scheme 
for ULs of IEEE 802.16 wireless communication systems. The GGRA scheme first designs a 
rate-assignment strategy (RAS) and formulates the resource allocation problem as an 
optimization equation that is subject to system constraints. The RAS is to allocate a resource for 
QoS guarantee and UL frame structure conformity. Also, to make the computation tractable, the 
GGRA scheme considers the interference due to user channel correlation and aggregates those 
SSs that have high correlation in the same group. Then, it adopts the GA to solve the optimization 
problem and obtain an optimal assignment matrix for the UL of the IEEE 802.16 communication 
system. Notice that these groups turn to the genes of chromosomes in the GA, where the number 
of groups (genes) would be much smaller than the number of original SSs. Then, the individuals 
in the GA are represented by arbitrary permutation of group orders and used to decide the frame 
allocation. If there is still remaining resource after the GA, a residual resource reallocation (RRR)

[39] was proposed to tune the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each 
MCS based on the last transmission result. In addition, an MCS selection criterion was analyzed 
to find the mapping between SINR and MCS to maximize the average user throughput [40]. An 
adaptive control algorithm, considering not only the last transmission result but the age of CQI 
reports as well, was studied in [41]. 
Moreover, a new HARQ procedure based on a Q-learning algorithm (QL-HARQ) [42] was 
once proposed to learn the policy of choosing the MCS. Primarily, Q-learning (QL) is a very 
strong off-policy temporal-difference (TD) control method for reinforcement learning [43]–[46]. 
To decide the most suitable action, the QL algorithm learns the action-value function by a 
feedback reinforcement signal, which can be a reward or a punishment. However, it is very hard 
for the QL algorithm to explicitly describe the relationship between the MCS level and the 
throughput when the CQI report is obsolete, considering the fulfillment of the BLER 
requirement. 
A more powerful intelligent technique called fuzzy QL (FQL) algorithm [47], [48] has been 
proposed to model the motion and way of thinking of humans in robot design. The FQL 
algorithm is an extension of the QL into fuzzy inference systems, where fuzzy logic [49], [10] is a 
mathematical approach to emulate the way humans think by using if–then rules. Fuzzy logics can 
deal with soft reasoning instead of crisp. However, the performance of fuzzy logics is highly 
related to the design of the fuzzy rule base. The FQL algorithm applies the QL algorithm in fuzzy 
logics to adaptively adjust the fuzzy rule base for the varying environment according to the 
feedback reinforcement signal. Therefore, the FQL algorithm takes advantages from both fuzzy 
logics and QL to adapt the closed-loop system to uncertain environments. Many applications of 
the FQL algorithm can be found in [50]–[52]. For example, call admission control using the FQL 
algorithm for wideband code-division multiple-access/wireless local area network heterogeneous 
networks with multimedia traffic can achieve higher system throughput and lower handoff rate 
than conventional effective schemes under the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements [52]. 
Therefore, we propose an intelligent HARQ (iHARQ) scheme using the FQL algorithm for 
HSDPA systems in this paper with the purpose of maximizing the system throughput and to keep 
the BLER requirement guaranteed. The iHARQ scheme, which is a sort of IR scheme, not only 
determines an appropriate MCS level for initial packet transmission but learns the function 
between the MCS level and the measured BLER with delayed CQI as well. An initial result of 
this paper was given in [53]. In this paper, we further effectively divide the fuzzy rules into three 
parts to accelerate the learning process. Moreover, the reinforcement signal is properly designed 
according to the results of both initial transmission and retransmissions. Simulation results show 
that the iHARQ scheme outperforms the conventional ATS scheme [39] and the QL-based HARQ 
(QL-HARQ) scheme [42]. In particular, when the mobile user is in speed of between 10 and 120 
km/h, the iHARQ scheme can increase the system throughput up to 75.2% compared with the 
ATS scheme and up to 16.4% compared with the QL-HARQ scheme.

In WLAN systems, the standard IEEE 802.11e [57] proposes the enhanced distributed 
channel access (EDCA), which allows the access point (AP) to initiate a period of transmission 
opportunity in the contention period. This standard amendment also defines differentiated 
priorities to support QoS. In this paper, EDCA is used for data transmissions. 
 Proposed Utility and Game Theory (UGT) based Network Selection Scheme 
Before the utility and game-theory (UGT) based network selection scheme, the candidate 
networks selection is performed first when a new call or a handoff call arrives. The candidate 
networks selection determines which networks are available for the call request. For each 
candidate network, the UGT scheme obtains values from the computations of utility function for 
QoS satisfaction and cooperative game for network preference. The utility function for QoS 
satisfaction computes the utility value based on the satisfaction of QoS requirements of the call 
request. The cooperative game for network preference computes the preference value from the 
network point of view. Its main goal is to decrease the number of handoff and achieve load 
balancing. Finally, the utility value and the preference value of each candidate network are 
combined linearly, and the network which has the maximum combined value is the most suitable 
one for the call request. 
A. Candidate Network Selection 
There are two constraints, the signal strength constraint and network load constraint, in the 
candidate networks selection. If the pilot signal strength of network i  received at the MS 
exceeds the candidate networks constraint, the network i  will be classified as a candidate 
network. The network load constraint is used to ensure that the admittance of a call request will 
not affect the quality of the ongoing connections, which can be expressed by 
 HE a thη η+ ≤  (3) 
where HE  is the current load intensity of a candidate cell, aη  is the load intensity increment by 
the call request a , and thη  is the predefined load intensity threshold.

where iD  is the average packet delay measured in the candidate network i , reqD  is the 
maximum delay tolerance of the call request, and thD  is a threshold used to represent whether 
the QoS is highly satisfied. Similarly, the evaluation function of packet dropping rate could be 
defined as

maximum allowable packet dropping rate of the call request, and thR  is a threshold used to 
represent whether the QoS is highly satisfied. 
Only real-time traffic classes have delay bound, hence the non-real-time traffic classes need 
not take ,D if  and ,R if  into consideration. Once the value of utility function of every candidate 
network is computed, the normalized utility value for the candidate network i could be obtained 
by

C. Cooperative Game for Network Preference 
A network preference game is formulated and the cooperative game is adopted to achieve 
load balancing and reduce the handoff occurrence frequency. There are three components in the 
network preference game, players, strategies, and payoffs. The players of this game are the n  
candidate networks denoted by 1 2{ , , , }nN N N… . Since every candidate network has its own 
strategy, there are total n  strategies, denoted by 1 2{ , , , }nNP NP NP… , in this game, where iNP  
is the preference value for iN , 1, 2, ,i n= … . Note that 1 1

selected in the candidate networks decision. This decision issue can be formulated as an

Fuzzy Active Period Adaptation Scheme for Dynamic Spectrum Access 
 System Model 
In this paper, WLAN is regarded as the primary system in 2.4 GHz unlicensed band and CR 
system performs IEEE 802.16h protocol to be the secondary system. We will efficiently using the 
white space in 2.4 GHz unlicensed band and evaluate the performance improvement. We assume 
the CR BSs are collocated with WLAN BSs to share the spectrum in same coverage. Additionally, 
the interference from other cells is omitted due to well cell planning with enough reuse distance. 
For WLAN system, distributed coordinator function (DCF) for medium access control (MAC) 
based on the CSMA/CA protocol and CCA Mode 1 [57] was considered. 
Based on IEEE 802.16h protocol [9], two mechanisms named Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) and 
Extended Quiet Period (EQP) are adopted to perform white space detection efficiently. Fig. 2 
 16
contrast, if the length of EQP observed at ( 1)BUF k −  is large, we will presume that the traffic 
in WLAN network is rising in this time period. To gather more objective information about the 
traffic load condition from the length of EQP, we take exponential moving average (EMA) of 
consecutive three EQP observed before ( 1)BUF k − , that is 
 ( 1) ( 1) (1 ) ( 2)EQP k EQP k EQP kα α− = ⋅ − + − ⋅ −  (17) 
where ( 2)EQP k −  is the EMA calculated at ( 2)thk −  BUF. 
We consider ( 1)EQP k −  will have more information for predicting the traffic of WLAN 
than ( 2)EQP k − , so we set (1 )α α> − . In the same reason, we assume the effective 
information proposed by ( 1)EQP k −  is twice useful for us to predict the traffic load condition 
than ( 2)EQP k − , so we set 0.66α = , (1 ) 0.34α− = , where : (1 ) 2 :1α α− ≅ . 
Besides, the length of AP, denoted by N , determines the resource partition and majorly 
decides usage of both CR system and WLAN system. That is, it affects the throughput and packet 
delay for both systems. So the active period should be adjusted carefully. We will adjust it 
depending on the busy ratio, the active period, and weighted average EQP at the beginning of 
each BUF. Assume the frames for active period is denoted as N  and BUF is a constant value set 
as 100 frames here. To get the better utilization, we apply the fuzzy logic approach by 
considering the following inputs: 
( 1)kρ − : busy ratio of WLAN measured during quiet period and EQP between the 
APs of ( 1)BUF k −  and ( )BUF k , input value: [0 ~ 1] . 
( 1)N k − : number of frames for active period at ( 1)BUF k − ,  
input value: [0 frames ~ 95 frames] . 
( 1)EQP k − : weighted average number of EQP before starting using ( )BUF k ,  
input value: [0 frames ~ frames)∞ . 
Through the proposed FAPA, we can get an output: 
( )N k∆ : variation in N  at ( )BUF k , for its range [ 100% ~100%]− .  
That is, ( ) ( 1) (1 ( ))N k N k N k= − ⋅ + ∆ . 
While the length of BUF is set as 100 frames, we reserved at least 5 frames as the quiet period to 
guarantee the access time of WLAN. 
Next we define the term sets of inputs and output of the fuzzy AP adaptor. For term sets of 
input variables ( 1)N k − , ( 1)kρ − , and ( 1)EQP k − , ( ( 1))T N k − = {Small (S), Middle (M), 
Large (L)}, ( ( 1))T kρ − = {Low (L), Medium (M), High (H)}, and ( ( 1))T EQP k − = {Calm (C), 
 18
parameters according to the levels of traffic conditions they can predict in WLAN system. 
TABLE I: THE RULE BASE OF FUZZY AP ADAPTOR 
 
After setting up the membership functions of inputs and output, we will build 27 fuzzy rules 
as the fuzzy rule base in Table I to do the defuzzification. Then we adopt the max-min inferred 
method and use the center of gravity (COG) method for defuzzification method [61] 
TOPIC 3 
Dynamic Priority Resource Allocation Scheme 
 System Model 
Suppose that there are N  subchannels in the uplink of the IEEE 802.16 OFDMA system 
and that each subchannel consists of q  adjacent subcarriers. There are K  SSs going to 
communicate with one BS in one cell. Each SS can be viewed as a single user containing 
different service types of traffic to transmit, and each service type in an SS has its individual 
queue. Furthermore, based on the IEEE 802.16 uplink rectangle frame structure, traffic data are 
transmitted in fixed length of frames, and each frame contains L  OFDMA slots. Then, the total 
number of resource units in each frame is L N×  slots, which is in sequence from the leftmost of 
the top subchannel to the rightmost of the bottom subchannel. 
IEEE 802.16 defines the following four service types, and each of them has different QoS 
requirements. 
1). UGS: The UGS supports real-time traffic that periodically generates fixed-size data 
packets. Thus, the BS generally allocates a fixed amount of bandwidth for this 
type of service.

very urgent and that all of the residual bits in the buffer had better finish transmission in the 
current frame. Otherwise, the priority value , rtPSkγ  can be set lower based on the average 
transmission rate , rtPSk kB D∆ . We further add to its denominator a bias of log( )kD∆  to lessen 
its served transmission bits and make room for other possible high-priority users since its residual 
time before QoS violation is still long. Note that the larger thD  is, the earlier the warning and the 
better the QoS satisfaction of RT services will be. However, in this situation, the system will 
reserve or consume more resource to protect these RT services, and the system throughput will be 
reduced. Therefore, thD  should be properly set. 
For nrtPS, the average transmission rate should be larger than the requirement of the 
minimum transmission rate, which is denoted by *, nrtPSkR . Denote , nrtPSkB  as the number of 
residual bits of the user k ’s nrtPS HOL packet buffered at the current frame and kT∆  as the 
maximum number of frames left for the nrtPS HOL packet of user k  at the current frame so that 
the requirement *, nrtPSkR  can be fulfilled. Similarly, , nrtPSkγ  is designed as

where thT  is a predefined threshold for nrtPS to make an obvious priority distinction, log( )kT∆  
is a bias by the same concept as that for rtPS, and a  is a weighting constant 0 1a< ≤ , which is 
used to depress the priority of nrtPS traffic as compared to that of rtPS traffic. Similar to thD , 
thT  should properly be determined.

data symbol of user k  on subchannel n  at the thl  slot. Note that the normalized 
M -quadratic-amplitude modulation (QAM) is used so that the data symbol has unitary mean 
energy. 
We assume that the coherence time of the wireless channel is larger than the duration of one 
frame. Hence, the CSI is assumed to remain constant over one frame. In addition, perfect 
estimation of CSI on each subchannel of each user is assumed in this paper. Since in the IEEE 
802.16 uplink system, the SSs only report the uplink CSI on each subchannel, the channel gain of 
each adjacent subcarrier that a subchannel contains is assumed to be the same. Let ,k nh  be the 
uplink channel gain between user k  and the considered BS on subchannel n . Note that the 
channel gain is not a function of slot time l  since it remains fixed during one time frame. The

A. Problem Formulation 
The goal of the proposed DPRA scheme is to maximize the overall system throughput and 
satisfy QoS requirements. Here, the allocation problem is first mathematically formulated into 
optimization equations. Let ( ),k nx
l  be the assignment variable indicating the number of bits carried 
by each subcarrier of subchannel n  with modulation order assigned to user k  at the thl  
OFDMA slot. ( ),k nx

The DPRA scheme selects users from the set of backlogged users Ω  according to the

highest priority value, which is denoted by maxγ . To achieve the goal of system 
throughput maximization, the DPRA scheme selects the subchannel with the best CSI in 
free subchannel set freeN  for the acceptable highest modulation order. In other words, 
from hΩ  and 
freeN , an optimal pair of user and subchannel * *( , )k n  would be chosen

[62]. Thus, if low (high) correlation SSs are aggregated into the different (same) group and 
allocated to the same (different) slots, the interference term in (24) can be neglected. 
 Proposed Genetic Algorithm with SS Grouping Resource Allocation (GGRA) Scheme

where M  is the number of receiving antennas of the base station. And the rate assignment 
strategy (RAS) is described as follows 
1). SS with the lowest ,k sF  is selected first. 
2). when kSS  is selected, determine ,k sR  by (29). 
3). each SS should obey consistent allocation.

l . If there are remaining bits in the slots, they will be given to each 
service class of SS k  proportionally to their service queue length. When finishing the allocation 
for this SS, the GA will continue finding the next SS in the same group by the residual lifetime. If 
every SS in this group is scheduled, then the GA will allocate the resource to SSs in the next 
group until all SSs are scheduled or no remaining resource is left. 
If there are still free slots available when all SSs are allocated, the GGRA performs RRR for 
utilization maximization. In each available free slot, the GGRA will check the power and buffer 
constraints of each SS and the rank constraint for the system. Then, it gives the slot to the SS that 
supports the highest modulation order among all SSs under the system constraints. Each selected 
SS can transmit its four kinds of service in the slot. The RRR will iteratively choose the SS until 
there are no remaining slots or packets in the queue. Consequently, a UL allocation map for each 
individual is determined. Notice that one individual gets one allocation result. After finishing the 
allocation, the GA should evaluate the fitness of each individual related with one allocation result. 
Since we want to maximize the throughput with QoS guarantee, a predefined fitness function, 
which is denoted by Π , is defined to evaluate the individuals, which is given by 
 ( , )

where α  is a constant to control the exponential decay, ν  is the unsatisfied ratio, which is the 
number of bits for UGS, rtPS, and nrtPS unsatisfied service traffic divided by the total number of 
bits of the original HOL packet, and W  represents the total number of used slots in the current 
scheduled frame. Π  contains two terms: The first term gives a value about spectrum efficiency, 
and the second term gives a value that is related with the unsatisfied ratio. As a result, I  
individuals with the highest fitness value will be chosen to become the offspring. If the maximum 
iteration number is reached, or the optimal solution is found, which leads to 64-QAM for each 
slot and zero unsatisfied ratio, then the GGRA will terminate and choose the best individual with 
the highest fitness value. The corresponding allocation result will be adopted for UL resource 
allocation. Otherwise, the GGRA will go back to the crossover and mutation and produce the new 
individuals for allocation in the next iteration.

of the user. We model the correlation of the shadow fading as a normalized autocorrelation

 Proposed Intelligent Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (iHARQ) Scheme 
The iHARQ scheme using the FQL algorithm is here designed to appropriately determine a 
suitable MCS level for the initial packet transmission of the transport block in HARQ control. 
Usually, the decision problem of the initial packet transmission in the HARQ control scheme is 
formulated as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP). The iHARQ scheme applies the 
FQL technique to model and solve the MDP problem. 
At every decision episode of the nth TTI, the iHARQ scheme selects the average BLER 
performance indication and the CQI, which is denoted by ( )BLER n  and ( )CQI n , respectively, 
as input linguistic variables to infer the suitable action of MCS level for the initial packet 
transmission. Thus, it has the input system state at the thn  TTI, which is denoted by ( )X n  and 
expressed as 
 ( )( ) ( ), ( )X n BLER n CQI n=  (44) 
It defines the output linguistic variable at the thn  TTI, which is denoted by ( )a n , as the 
MCS level expressed as 
 ( ) , 1, ,ka n MCS k K= = …  (45) 
Note that the smaller MCS level has better BLER performance but lower system throughput, and 
there are ten kinds of MCS levels ( 10)K =  for the HARQ control given in Table II.

Fig. 6. Membership function of ( )CQI n  
( )BLER n . The 2A  and 3A  should be chosen to be close to 
*BLER  to satisfy the BLER 
requirement and enhance the system throughput. We set 2A = 
*0.7 BLER×  and 3A = 
*0.9 BLER× . In addition, we set 1A  ( 4A ) to be 
*0.5 (1.0) BLER×  to indicate that ( )BLER n  is 
in the very safe (dangerous) region. 
The fuzzy term set for ( )CQI n  is defined as ( )( )T CQI n  = { 1 ( 1)Level L , 2 ( 2)Level L , 
3 ( 3)Level L , 4 ( 4)Level L , 5 ( 5)Level L , 6 ( 6)Level L , 7 ( 7)Level L , 8 ( 8)Level L , 
9 ( 9)Level L , 10 ( 10)Level L }. Each term in ( )( )T CQI n  stands for the status of one CQI and 
is denoted by one kind of 10 MCS levels adopted to guarantee *BLER  during this CQI region. 
Each term B  in ( )CQI n  has a membership function denoted by ( )( )B CQI nµ , B = 1L , 
2L , …, or 10L . As shown in Fig. 6, ( )( )Li CQI nµ , 2, , 9i = …  is a triangular function with 
center at iB  and left (right) width 1i iB B −−  ( 1i iB B+ − ); ( )1 ( )L CQI nµ  ( ( )10 ( )L CQI nµ ) is a 
trapezoidal function with right (left) edge at 1B  ( 10B ) and right (left) width 1B  ( 10 9B B− ). The 
kB , for 1, ,k K= … , is set to be the required CQI value to maintain 
*BLER  for kMCS , and 
1 1B =  and 3kB k= × , for 2, , 10k = … . There are 30J =  kinds of linguistic terms (states) in 
( )X n , and jS  , 1 j J≤ ≤ , and ( ) ( )( )( ) , ( )A BBLER n CQI nµ µ  are the outputs to the fuzzy rule 
base and the inference engine, respectively. 
 36
the Q -value for this MCS would be increased. Hence, for each rule j , the MCS with maximum 
Q -value implies that the selected MCS is optimal at this situation. 
C. Inference Engine and Defuzzifier 
The inference engine emulates the way of thinking of humans to infer an action for each 
possible situation. Here, the inference engine determines an optimal action for each fuzzy rule j , 
1 j J≤ ≤  at every thn  TTI * ( )ja n . It takes ( )( )A BLER nµ , , ,A G Y R= , ( )( )B CQI nµ , 
1, , 10B L L= … , and ( ),n j kq S MCS , 1 j J≤ ≤ , 1 k K≤ ≤  as inputs and delivers the intensity 
of ( )X n  belonging to jS  , which is denoted by ,j nµ , which is defined as a product operation 
[20] of the ( )( )A BLER nµ  and ( )( )B CQI nµ  associated with jS  as outputs to the defuzzifier. 
The ,j nµ  is expressed as 
 ( ) ( ), ( ) ( ) , for 1j n A BBLER n CQI n j Jµ µ µ= × ≤ ≤  (48) 
where A  is G , Y  , or R  (B  is 1L , …, or 10L ) with respect to jS  . It also infers the 
*( )ja n  for each fuzzy rule j, 1 j J≤ ≤ , by the exploration/exploitation policy (EEP) [21] by 
 * ( ) arg max ( , ) , for 1j n j k
k
a n q S MCS j J= ≤ ≤  (49) 
The inference engine then outputs the intensity and the optimal action of jS  at the nth TTI, 
,j nµ  and * ( )ja n , to the defuzzifier. 
Finally, the defuzzifier is to determine an optimal action for this thn  TTI HARQ operation. 
The defuzzifier emulates the way humans think when making a decision. Taking ,j nµ  and 
*( )ja n  as inputs, the defuzzifier obtains the global optimal action, which is denoted by 
*( )a n , by

However, the value of *( )a n  may be a real number, whereas the actual output value should 
be an integer. Therefore, the final output action *( )a n  is to round off *( )a n  in (50) to obtain an 
integer value. 
D. Q-Function Update 
The Q -function update emulates the learning process of humans with interactions of the 
environment. It generates *( , ( ))n jq S a n∆  to update the Q -value in the fuzzy rule base. The 
input of the Q -function update is the reinforcement signal ( )r n , which is derived according to 
the transmission results of the iHARQ scheme in the HSDPA system. The Q -value update for 
 38
balance off the reward. If the packet is dropped, then a severe punishment, i.e., ( ) 10r n = − , is 
given. 
For the red part, the MCS level would be chosen to recover the BLER performance. Hence, 
the reinforcement signal ( )r n  is set as 
 
*
, if packet is successfully received without retransmission
( ) 1, if packet is successfully received with retransmission

 (53) 
If the packet is successfully received without retransmission, then the selected MCS level 
will receive a reward. Since this MCS level selection decreases the ( )BLER n , the reward is set 
to *kR R  to make a fast recovery of the BLER performance. If the packet is successfully 
received with retransmission, then the punishment will be set larger than the reward to let the 
iHARQ scheme have an opportunity to select other MCS levels in the next decision process. 
However, this punishment should not be too large, since the packet is successfully received. 
Therefore, we set ( ) 1r n = − . If the packet is dropped, then a severe punishment, i.e., ( ) 10r n = − , 
is given to retrain this action.  
Whenever the reinforcement signals are yielded, the adjustment step for the Q -value of

Fig. 7. (a) New call blocking rate, and (b) forced termination rate 
 
Fig. 8. Handoff occurrence frequency 
Fig. 8 shows the handoff occurrence frequency, which is defined as the number of handoff 
per call conversation. The total handoff occurrence frequency in UGT is about 30% lower than 
that in iterative TOPSIS. The reason is that UGT takes the mobility of MS into consideration, but 
iterative TOPSIS does not. It can be found that the non-real-time call has higher handoff 
frequency in UGT than that in iterative TOPSIS. Since the real-time call is more sensitive to the 
occurrence of handoff, UGT will select a suitable access network to prevent frequent handoff for 
the real-time call. Therefore the penalty weight would be more influential for real-time call than 
nonreal-time call in UGT. 
 42
In this part, a utility and game-theory (UGT) based network selection scheme is proposed 
for heterogeneous wireless networks. After obtaining the set of candidate networks, a utility value 
is computed in UGT to represent the satisfaction degree of QoS requirements. In order to achieve 
load balancing and less handoff overhead, a cooperative network preference game is defined in 
UGT to obtain the preference value for each candidate network. Finally, the utility value and the 
preference value of each candidate network would be linearly combined, and the most suitable 
candidate network for the call request can be decided according to the combined values the 
candidate networks. Simulation results show that UGT can achieve lower new call blocking rate 
and forced termination rate than iterative TOPSIS, which means that the heterogeneous system 
can accommodate more calls when UGT is adopted. In addition, the total handoff occurrence 
frequency in UGT is about 30% lower than that in iterative TOPSIS because UGT takes the 
mobility of MS into consideration. Accordingly, the handoff overhead can be reduced 
significantly. But the packet dropping rate of the realtime call in UGT is higher than that in 
iterative TOPSIS because the network with the most available resource for the real-time call is 
not necessarily the most suitable one if the mobility of MS is considered.

where one WLAN access point and the CR BS are collocated with same coverage in unlicensed 
band. We evaluate the performance of CR users in the single cell to investigate the advantage of 
the proposed FAPA algorithm by comparing with Fixed-AP and Pure-WLAN. 
Fig. 11 shows the individual CR system throughput versus offered WLAN traffic intensity. It 
can be found that the throughput of the CR system decreases when the WLAN traffic intensity 
increases. When the traffic of WLAN system is increasing, the unlicensed spectrum is occupied 
by WLAN system more frequently and there is no much white space for CR system. The 
throughput of CR system will decrease due to the scarcity of white space. Besides, the throughput 
of FAPA method is higher than Fixed-AP method when the offered WLAN traffic intensity is 
below 0.55. That means FAPA method can adaptively adjust AP to gain more white space than 
 44
 
Fig. 13. The proportion of idle time in unlicensed spectrum 
because there are too many WLAN users in WLAN system and cause more contention collision. 
The successful transmission probability in WLAN system decreases as collision probability 
becomes high. By using FAPA, the throughput of WLAN system is almost the same with 
Pure-WLAN. This means FAPA can adjust its usage in unlicensed spectrum efficiently on the 
premise that reduces the interference in WLAN system. By using Fixed-AP, the throughput of 
WLAN system will decrease and lower than the Pure-WLAN system when the traffic intensity is 
greater than 0.55. This shows that Fixed-AP cannot timely adjust its usage in unlicensed spectrum 
and it causes interference in WLAN system. 
Fig. 13 shows the proportion of idle time versus offered WLAN traffic intensity. The 
proportion of idle time which means the total idle time in unlicensed spectrum over the total 
simulation time and it reveals that the FAPA and Fixed-AP indeed have smaller idle time ratio 
than Pure-WLAN. Furthermore, FAPA has lower idle time ratio than Fixed-AP while offered 
WLAN traffic intensity smaller than 0.6. The phenomenon is expected since FAPA can 
dynamically adjust the length of AP according the situation of the WLAN traffic, so it can access 
white space more efficiently than Fixed-AP. On the other hand, when the offered WLAN traffic 
intensity is higher than 0.6, the proportion of idle time in unlicensed spectrum is very small. It is 
hard for CR system to access the unlicensed spectrum because the contentions between WLAN 
users are fierce and there is nearly no white space for CR system. In this situation, CR system 
would decrease AP in unlicensed spectrum to prevent impact on WLAN system. These results 
respond to the phenomenon shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 and it is reasonable for FAPA to 
decrease CR system usage under high WLAN traffic intensity. 
Fig. 14 depicts the average packet delay of WLAN system versus offered WLAN traffic 
intensity. We can find that the average packet delay of WLAN system coexistence with CR 
system is larger than Pure-WLAN. The major reason is that WLAN users have to wait until CR

outperforms Fixed-AP method on impact of WLAN packet delay. 
TOPIC 3 
Dynamic Priority Resource Allocation Scheme 
To analyze the performance of the proposed DPRA scheme, the DPRA scheme is compared 
with the optimal method, which obtains the optimal solution by exhaustively solving the 
mathematical equations given in (33)–(36). However, when performing the consistent allocation 
for a user, the optimal method will choose the sort of consistent allocation that achieves the 
maximum system throughput. The DPRA scheme is also compared to one conventional scheme 
called the EFS algorithm, proposed in [19]. The EFS algorithm allocates slots to each service 
according to the order of UGS, rtPS, nrtPS, and BE, where UGS (BE) has highest (lowest) 
priority. At each slot time interval, it assigns a slot of the selected subchannel to the user with 
maximum transmission rate on that subchannel. If all the subchannels of a certain slot interval are 
exhausted, the EFS algorithm will move to the next slot interval and iteratively perform 
allocation slot by slot. It is an intuitive algorithm, and its performance is close to an optimal 
solution [19], [23]. 
Fig. 15 shows the system throughput versus the traffic intensity. It can be seen that the 
system throughput of the proposed DPRA scheme is close to that of the optimal method; the 
former is just less than the latter by an amount of 3.58% at a traffic intensity of 0.8. This 
conforms to the statement in [23]: the result of the greedy method is close to the optimal solution 
when the number of users is large. It can also be found that the proposed DPRA scheme achieves 
a higher system throughput than the EFS algorithm, particularly at higher traffic load because at  
 48

Fig. 18. Ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users 
Fig. 18 shows the ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users, which is defined as the number of HTTP 
users whose average transmission rate is less than the minimum required transmission rate, over 
all HTTP users. For the DPRA scheme, a high priority value will be given to the HTTP user if its 
average transmission rate is going to be lower than the minimum required transmission rate. 
Therefore, the ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users of the DPRA scheme keeps close to zero, even 
when the traffic intensity is high, and the minimum required transmission rate can be guaranteed. 
On the other hand, the optimal method is mainly to maximize the system throughput. Thus, 
sometimes, the minimum required transmission rate cannot be assured when the traffic intensity 
becomes high. The EFS algorithm is designed with a fixed priority scheme that initially assigns  
 50
 
Fig. 20. Average number of iterations 
and subchannel and check the power constraint. The complexity of an iteration by the DPRA and 
the EFS is almost the same and equal to ( )O KN . It can also be found that the number of 
iterations by the optimal method is much lager than that of the DPRA scheme. The optimal 
method takes more than 23 500 iterations, while the DPRA scheme needs only 23 iterations at a 
traffic intensity of 0.8. 
In this part, a DPRA scheme that performs consistent allocation has been proposed for IEEE 
802.16 uplink systems with multimedia traffic. The DPRA scheme intends to maximize the 
system throughput and fulfill QoS requirements. It originally designs a priority value for each 
service type according to the urgency and QoS requirements of the traffic and dynamically 
adjusts it frame by frame. Simulation results have shown that the performance of the DPRA 
scheme is better than the conventional EFS algorithm, which performs allocation slot by slot. In 
addition, benefiting from the consistent allocation, the computational complexity of the DPRA 
scheme is much less than that of the conventional EFS algorithm. Furthermore, the system 
throughput of the proposed DPRA scheme is close to that of the optimal method when the traffic 
intensity is larger, but the computational complexity of the DPRA scheme is much less than that 
of the optimal solution. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed DPRA scheme can reach 
throughput maximization and QoS satisfaction with a lower computational complexity and 
transmission overhead. The DPRA scheme would be suitable for real applications. 
TOPIC 4 
Genetic Algorithm with SS Grouping Resource Allocation Scheme 
Here we evaluate the performance of proposed GGRA scheme by comparing with the EFS 
[19] and MLWDF algorithms [30], which use a heuristic approach and define the service priority 
statically and dynamically, respectively. 
 52
 
Fig. 22. Ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users 
MLWDF scheme dynamically considers the channel gain and the weighted delay. Thus, it can 
take care of the UGS, the rtPS, and the nrtPS traffic in a fair way. Therefore, the MLWDF can 
achieve very low voice and video dropping rates as the GGRA. Also, the EFS scheme always 
serves the voice packet prior to other service traffic. Thus, it can achieve a zero voice packet 
dropping rate for all traffic cases. Furthermore, the video packet size is small enough and still has 
higher priority than the HTTP and FTP packets; therefore, it can also be sent out with almost zero 
dropping rate. 
Fig. 22 shows the ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users. It can be seen that the GGRA can 
maintain zero unsatisfied users under the traffic intensity up to 0.8. This is due to the fact that the 
GGRA considers a long-term average minimum rate requirement for each HTTP user, and the 
RAS can give more resources to HTTP users when the long-term rate is below the minimum rate 
requirement. Therefore, if one packet is considered unsatisfied, the GGRA scheme will give a 
lower residual lifetime to the next HTTP packet of this user and force the RAS to send it out more 
quickly. Finally, the overall HTTP rate will be compensated and kept above the minimum rate 
requirement. The MLWDF scheme fairly considers HTTP as the GGRA scheme; therefore, it can 
keep a low unsatisfied ratio as well. However, the EFS scheme serves HTTP packets at a lower 
priority than voice and video packets. Thus, the average rate of HTTP users will severely 
decrease in the high-traffic case and cause a high ratio of unsatisfied HTTP users. 
Fig. 23 shows the FTP throughputs of the three allocation schemes. The arrival rate of the 
FTP traffic is much higher than the other service traffic, and the FTP throughput degradation will 
severely affect the system throughput. It can be seen that the FTP throughput of the GGRA 
increases until traffic intensity larger than 0.8. This phenomenon is due to the cooperation of the 
GA and the RAS, which save more resources for the FTP traffic. The MLWDF considers a local  
 54
 
Fig. 24. Average computation time 
In this part, a GGRA scheme has been proposed for the IEEE 802.16 UL system. With the 
design of the SS grouping, the GGRA scheme makes the adoption of the GA optimization 
technique computationally tractable and, thus, feasible in real-time applications. The GGRA 
scheme can maximize the system throughput under the system constraints and QoS requirements, 
where an RAS equipped with a predefined residual lifetime is originally designed. Simulation 
results show that the GGRA scheme performs better than the MLWDF and EFS schemes. The 
GGRA scheme can achieve high system throughput and fulfill QoS requirements for all types of 
traffic. 
TOPIC 5 
Intelligent HARQ Scheme for HSDPA 
The iHARQ scheme is compared with two conventional adaptive HARQ schemes. The first 
scheme is the ATS scheme [39]. The ATS scheme adaptively sets the SINR threshold for each 
MCS level. After each transmission, the thresholds that are close to the SINR of the last 
transmission will be increased (decreased) if the transmission fails (succeeds). The increasing 
step of the threshold adjustment for the failed transmission is set to be *0.1 (1 )BLER× − , 
whereas the decreasing step for the successful transmission is set to be *0.05 BLER× . The 
second scheme is the QL-based HARQ (QL-HARQ) scheme [42]. The QL-HARQ scheme uses 
the QL algorithm to learn an optimal policy in both link adaptation and HARQ retransmission 
version. The transmission cost is defined as   2(( ( , ) ( )) ( ))k k k kSINR x a SINR a SINR a− , where 
( , )k kSINR x a  is the received SINR at UE for the state kx  with action ka , and 
 ( )kSINR a  is 
the required SINR with action ka . After learning, the QL-HARQ scheme will choose the MCS 
where the SINR threshold is closest to the received SINR. 
To evaluate the performance, we define an HSDPA service power ratio (HSPR) as the  
 56
 
Fig. 26. Average computation time 
ATS scheme adjusts the SINR threshold for each MCS according to ACK/NACK information. In 
addition, since the granularity of the adjustment is fixed and the dynamic range of the adjustment 
is small, this scheme is less flexible, and the system throughput is the lowest. 
Fig. 26 shows the BLER performance measure versus HSPR. It can be seen that the BLER 
performances of the three compared schemes are always satisfied. The reason for this is that the 
iHARQ scheme intends to enhance the system throughput as well as guarantee the BLER 
performance via the FQL algorithm. When ( )BLER n  is lower than the BLER requirement, the 
iHARQ scheme takes an aggressive action by selecting a higher MCS level to enhance the system 
throughput but would increase the ( )BLER n . When ( )BLER n  is over the BLER requirement, 
the iHARQ scheme selects a conservative action by choosing a lower MCS level to decrease 
( )BLER n . Hence, the iHARQ scheme can maintain the BLER performance just below the BLER 
requirement. On the other hand, the QL-HARQ scheme adjusts the Q -value according to the 
received SINR and the required SINR, which is too sensitive to the fast varying channel condition. 
This makes the QL-HARQ scheme adopt a conservative action and have the best BLER 
performance. The ATS scheme adjusts the SINR thresholds only based on the ACK/NACK 
information, which is also too sensitive to the fast varying channel condition. However, since the 
adjustment step is fixed, the ATS scheme has higher BLER performance than the QL-HARQ 
scheme. 
Fig. 27 presents the packet dropping ratio versus HSPR. In the simulation, if a packet failed 
to be decoded after three retransmissions, then this packet will be dropped. It can be found that 
the ATS (QL-HARQ) scheme has the largest (smallest) packet dropping ratio, and the iHARQ 
scheme is in the middle. The iHARQ scheme has the packet dropping rate in the middle, but it 
still achieves the largest system throughput and has the highest BLER performance. It is because 
 58
 
Fig. 28. Average computation time 
 
Fig. 29. Average computation time 
set to 0. At the beginning, since the number of transmitted packets is not so many, a few 
erroneously transmitted packets would make the BLER performance metric become high. At this 
condition, the iHARQ scheme can take a more conservative action to quickly recover the BLER 
performance in a few iterations. It can be seen that the iHARQ achieves the best convergence 
performance. After 90 iterations, the iHARQ scheme converges the learning process and keeps 
the BLER performance guaranteed under the BLER requirement. On the other hand, the 
QL-HARQ scheme needs about 180 iterations to attain the BLER performance to fulfill the 
requirement since it adjusts the Q -value only based on the received SINR and the required

the initial packet transmission. According to the simulation results, not only the system 
throughput can be increased, but also the QoS requirement can be satisfied with the use of 
iHARQ. Therefore, the proposed iHARQ scheme is considered as an effective technique to 
improve the transmission reliability in CCRN. 
Aim to the working items about traffic control and scheduling in wireless CCRN in this 
project, we respectively attain several concrete and notable results by using intelligent techniques 
such as game theory, genetic algorithm, fuzzy logics, and Q-learning. Comparing with the 
conventional traffic control and scheduling schemes, the intelligent techniques provide superior 
adaptation ability to face the wireless communication environment. These intelligent techniques 
effectively help us solve the critical communication issues. Moreover, the realization 
complexities of the proposed intelligent schemes have also been discussed and the evaluation 
results show that the proposed schemes are also suitable to be realized in real-world. We believe 
those valuable achievements from this project must benefit the communication industry.
