Abstract 
 hMYH, a putative human E. coli MutY homology, can effectively remove adenine opposite to 
GO or G in duplex oligonucleotides with its glycosylase and AP lyase activities. Its germline 
mutations have been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer in Caucasian population. In 
this study, we have modified the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) for better 
analysis of mutations in hMYH. We first employed the plasmid DNA containing hMYH as the DNA 
template to establish the optimum AS-PCR conditions, and we found that the reliability of AS-PCR 
might be improved by reducing the template concentration, adjusting annealing temperature, as well 
as imbalanced dNTP. By employing the established conditions, we have screened for hMYH 
mutations, such as G382D, Y165C and V232F, from the genome of 30 Taiwanese patients who had 
been diagnosed as colorectal cancer by the Taichung Veterans General Hospital. However, none of 
patients were detected with these reported mutations in hMYH, which further demonstrated that the 
frequencies of hMYH mutations might depend on the pathology of colorectal cancer and vary 
among different ethnic groups.

Introduction 
  Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) is a powerful molecular biology 
technique for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis in genetic diagnosis of many 
cancers. However, its accuracy has to rely on expensive modifications, either by blocking the 
terminal of primers or by enhancing the activity of DNA polymerase with recombinant techniques 
(Bi and Stambrook, 1998; Liao et al., 2005). Otherwise, it may fail to distinguish the SNP in cancer 
related genes, especially those between different alleles. To investigate whether the AS-PCR with 
conventional PCR can be improved to characterize SNPs between different alleles at a relatively 
low cost, we have optimized the PCR conditions to increase the sensitivity of AS-PCR for single 
nucleotide mutation. In this study, we demonstrated that the concentration of DNA template, 
annealing temperature, and the ratio of dNTP were critical for the sensitivity of AS-PCR. 
 
 Meanwhile, we have previous demonstrated that hMYH exhibits the glycosylase and AP lyase 
properties, which can effectively remove adenine opposite to GO or G in duplex oligonucleotides 
(Gu and Lu, 2001; Parker et al., 2001; Gu et al., 2002). The defective of hMYH may cause the 
 6
colorectal adenomatous polyps registered in Taichung Veterans General Hospital were subjected to 
the study of hMYH gene analysis. All patients were Taiwanese and one had familial adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP) without APC mutation determination (Table 1). Written informed consent was 
taken from all patients. Genomic DNA was prepared from colorectal tumor as well as normal tissue 
10 cm away from the tumor, according to the standard procedure. The nature of all tissues was 
verified histologically.

Scheme 1. The strategy for the detection of specific point mutation by PCR using wild-type or mutant 
specific primers. 
 
Allele- specific PCR (AS-PCR) 
 The strategy for the detection of single nucleotide mutation by AS-PCR was illustrated in 
Scheme 1. For a DNA template containing either no mutation or single mutation, both wild-type 
specific primer and mutant specific primer were employed for PCR reaction. While using the 
wild-type specific primer, there was a mutation opposite to the 3' terminal of the primer in the DNA 
template if no noticeable PCR product was obtained; otherwise, there was no mutation in the DNA 
template. On the other hand, while using the mutant specific primer, there was a mutation opposite 
to the 3' terminal of the primer in the DNA template if noticeable PCR product was obtained; 
otherwise, there was no mutation in the DNA template 
  
DNA amplification 
 Certain amount of recombinant DNA containing hMYH was subjected to PCR analysis. The 
typical 50 μl of PCR reaction included amplification buffer (pH 8.0) with 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.4 
mM of four dNTPs, 3.75 unit of thermostable Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.2 µM of each primer. 
The procedure of the PCR reaction included 5 min of denaturation at 95oC; followed by 30 cycles 
of 1 min at 95 oC, 1 min at 60 ~ 64 oC, and 1 min at 72 oC. After 30 cycles, an extra cycle was 
performed with a 5 min extension time at 72 oC; the reaction was then maintained at 4oC. 5 μl of 
PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The rest of PCR product was gel purified 
and DNA sequencing was carried out using ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
 For a human sample, 150 ng of genomic DNA was applied in a 25 µl PCR reaction, whereas 
the condition and concentrations of PCR reaction were the same as those described above. In 
addition, an extensive length of DNA including the specific mutation was amplified by PCR with 
primers, THU-MYH-5 and THU-MYH-8 or THU-MYH-53 and THU-MYH-54, listed in Table 2. 
Their products were purified and sequenced to confirm the findings of AS-PCR.

3.2 The effect of template concentration on the sensitivity of AS-PCR 
(A) 
 
(B) 
 
Figure 3. The effect of template concentration on the sensitivity of AS-PCR. (A) W and M denoted the forward 
primer was the wild-type specific primer (Primer 1) and mutant specific primer (Primer 2), respectively. The original 
plasmid DNA as template was 50 ng in the 50 μl reaction. The percentage of mutant DNA template in total DNA 
template was 0, 30, 60, and 100 for lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The concentration of total dNTP was 50 mM and 
the annealing temperature was 60oC. Lane M was the DNA marker. All PCR reactions used primer THU-MYH-2 as the 
backward primer. (B) The ratio of PCR products from wild-type primer to mutant primer with various percentage of 
mutant DNA template in total DNA template and total DNA concentration. The original DNA template was 30 ng in the 
50 μl reaction, and was diluted by 10 (¡), 100 ( ), 1000 (c), and 10000 (y) fold.      
 
 In order to investigate the sensitivity of AS-PCR, we have introduced a mutation in the hMYH 
of constructed plasmid, as described in Materials and Methods. By mixing wild-type and mutant 
DNA templates in different ratio but remaining the total DNA concentration, we analyzed the PCR 
products with either wild-type or mutant primer by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 3A, the 
yield of PCR was clearly dependant on the template concentration. If the ratio of PCR product from 
wild-type primer to mutant primer was plotted against the percentage of mutant DNA template, the 
steepness of line represented the sensitivity of AS-PCR in distinguishing the mutant from the 
mixture of DNA template. As shown in Figure 3B, diluting DNA template significantly improved 
the sensitivity of AS-PCR, in particular with the mutant DNA less than 70%. According to the 
molecular ratio of human genomic DNA and the plasmid DNA we have constructed, the optimum 
concentration for human genomic DNA was recommended as 150 ng per 25 μl reaction.

Figure 5. The effect of dNTP on the specificity of mutation detection by PCR. (A) Gel electrophoresis of PCR 
products. (B) Restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products with Bgl II. Lanes 1 to 5 used the wild-type specific primer 
(THU-MYH-6) as the backward primer, whereas lanes 6 to 10 used the mutant specific primer (THU-MYH-7) as the 
backward primer. All PCR reactions used primer THU-MYH-5 as the forward primer. The total plasmid DNA as 
template was 60 ng in the 50 μl reaction. The molar ratio of [CG]/[AT] were 1:1, 2:3, 3:7, 1:4, and 1:9 for lines 1 and 6, 
2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, 5 and 10, respectively. Lane M was the DNA marker. The concentration of total dNTP was 50 
mM.  
 
 
3.4 The mismatch pattern determine the AS-PCR efficiency 
 We have utilized the plasmid containing hMYH as DNA template and established the optimum 
conditions in distinguishing mutant specific and wild-type specific primers used for mutation 
analysis, such as G382D, Y165C, V232F, and R227W. Under the optimum condition for each type 
of mutation, our results demonstrated the sensitivity of AS-PCR depended on the pattern of 
mismatch between the 3′ of mutant specific primer and the wild-type hMYH, in which the PCR 
efficiency was in the order of V232F > G382D > R227W > Y165C (Figure 6). Therefore, Taq DNA 
polymerase leaded the DNA synthesis bypassing the mismatch pattern in the order of C/A > A/C > 
T/G > A/G, Therefore, the current AS-PCR method provided the highest specificity for the mutation 
of V232F (A/G), but the lowest specificity for Y165C (C/A). This discrimination of PCR with Taq 
DNA polymerase against the mismatch pattern at the 3′ terminal of primer has also been reported by 
others (Huang et al., 1992; Latorra et al., 2003).

Conclusion 
 Although gene-line mutations of hMYH has been identified to correlate with 30% of colorectal 
cancer in European countries, especially in Caucasian population (Croitoru et al., 2004), our results 
indicated that the most common mutations of hMYH were not detected for patients of colorectal 
cancer in Taiwan population, in which were similar to those remarked for Korean and Japanese 
patients (Miyaki et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2006). We further demonstrated the ethnic specificity 
between the mutations of hMYH and the pathogenesis of multiple sporadic colorectal adenomas in 
different ethnic groups. In comparison with APC mutation, hMYH mutations seems to be more 
common causes of multiple adenoma phenotypes, but a less common cause of classic colorectal 
adenomatous polyposis (Sieber et al., 2003), in this study, we had only one case of FAP and no APC 
mutation was characterized. Therefore, in order to clarify the presence of particular hMYH variants 
and their role in the predisposition of multiple colorectal adenomas in Taiwan population, a 
large-scale analysis for specific subgroup of patients will be necessary.

1. Introduction 
Polyaniline (PANI) has been applied in fabricating various types of enzyme-based biosensor 
because of its porous structure as well as its adequate conductivity and thermal stability (Karyakin 
et al., 1996; Kang et al., 2001; Gerard et al., 2002; Kan et al., 2004; Xian et al., 2006; Chen and Gu, 
2008). To stabilize the immobilized enzyme in the matrix of PANI film, glutaraldehyde (GA) is 
usually employed as a bifunctional agent to crosslink enzyme molecules (Parente et al., 1992; Luo 
and Do, 2004; Migneault et al., 2004; Arora et al., 2007), but the crosslinking efficiency under 
general condition is not always satisfied (Fernandes et al., 2003; Migneault et al., 2004), which 
results in the lower sensitivity and poor stability of a biosensor. Previously, we have 
electrochemically synthesized the PANI film on a Pt electrode in the presence of bovine serum 
albumin (BSA), a lysine-rich enzyme, which provides extra free ε-amino groups for the further 
crosslinking of HRP with glutaraldehyde and has significantly improved the sensitivity and stability 
of the PANI modified biosensor (Chen and Gu, 2008). Nevertheless, to enhance the efficiency and 
stability of enzyme immobilization on an electrode is still the major issue of fabricating 
enzyme-based biosensors. 
Over the past few years, enzyme immobilizations in well-defined mesoporous silica materials 
have been proved to be promising to enhance the thermal stabilities and to maintain the catalytic 
activities of enzymes (Takahashi et al., 2000; Pandya et al., 2005). Enzymes entrapped inside the 
silica mesopores are less susceptible to pH and temperature alternations and organic solvents as 
well (Diaz and Balkus, 1996; Takahashi et al., 2000, 2001). Among them, SBA-15, which is 
 4
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene 
glycol)-block -poly(ethylene glycol) (EO20PO70EO20, Pluronic P123 with the molecular weight of 
5800), 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (TMB), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%) were 
commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, USA). Glutaraldehyde (GA, 25%, 
v/v), hydrogen peroxide (35%, v/v), aniline monomer were obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, 
Germany). All other reagents used for buffer and standard solution preparation were purchased 
from various commercial sources and were of analytical grade.  
 
2.2. Preparation of SBA-15 mesoporous silica 
SBA-15 was prepared according to the procedure described by Lettow et al. (Lettow et al., 
2000) with minor modifications. In a routine preparation, 2 g of Pluronic P123 was completely 
dissolved in 75 ml of 1.6 M HCl at 35oC with stirring, 0.2 g of TMB as a swelling agent was then 
added with stirring for 1 h. Later on, 4.25 g of TEOS was added to serve as the silica source. The 
mixture was further stirred for 24 h at 35oC and aged without stirring for 48 h at 100oC, while the 
solids were recovered by filtration and air-dried at room temperature. Finally, the product was 
calcined under 600 oC for 2 h to remove remaining triblock copolymer. 
 
2.3. Characterizations of SBA-15 mesoporous silica 
 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of calcined SBA-15 were performed on a X’Pert 
MPD pro diffractometer (PANalytical, ALMELO, The Netherlands) by using CuKα radiation (λ= 
 6
 Prior to immobilization, enzyme stock solution was prepared by dissolving 16.8 mg of HRP 
(5000 units) in 1 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), and then was aliquoted and stored at -80oC. 
To perform enzyme immobilization, 20 μl of HRP stock solution (100 units) was first diluted to 200 
μl by 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and subsequently 10 mg of SBA-15 was suspended in the 
enzyme solution for 1 h at 4oC on a rotator. The loaded SBA-15 (SBA-15(HRP)) was recovered by 
centrifugation with 7000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was also collected for protein analysis. 
The SBA-15(HRP) was washed by 0.1 M phosphate buffer for at least 5 times, and was finally 
resuspended in 10 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2). The amount of HRP immobilized on 
SBA-15 was determined according to Bradford assay with a Genesys 2 UV-vis spectrophotometer 
(Rochester, NY, USA) and HRP activity was assessed by 1-Step™ ABTS method (PIERCE 
Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, USA) according to manufactory’s procedure. 
 
2.6. Fabrication of the biosensor 
The PANI/Pt electrode was prepared similar to our previous publication (Chen and Gu, 2008). 
The Pt/ceramic electrode with a desired pattern (area: 0.28 cm2 ) was constructed by sputtering 
platinum to a ceramic plate (area: 2 cm2 ) with a shadow mask for 600 sec on a sputter instrument 
(JFC-1200, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), then washed with 3M NaOH and 3M HCl, rinsed with water, and 
finally dried under 50o C for one hour. A certain amount of aniline was then electropolymerized onto 
the Pt/ceramic base by immersing the working electrode into a solution containing 1 M HCl, 0.1 M 
aniline, whilst the potential was swept from 0.0 to 1.0 V for certain cycles under an ambient 
 8
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Characterizations of SBA-15 mesoporous silica 
 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of calcined SBA-15 (line (a) in Fig. 1A) revealed the 
well-resolved peaks of 2θ at 0.812, 1.392 and 1.588, in which represented the characteristic (100), 
(110), and (200) reflections of hexagonal mesoporous materials with p6mm symmetry (Lettow et al., 
2000). The total specific surface area, total pore volume, and BJH pore diameter of the SBA-15 
were estimated by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (Fig. 1B) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) 
calculation (Table 1).  
 Fig. 2a demonstrated the TEM image of calcined SBA-15 with well-ordered hexagonal array 
mesopores. The pore diameter was approximately 100 Å, in which was close to the center of pore 
size distribution (ca. 92 Å) shown in the inset of Fig. 1B. The pore size distribution indicated the 
major pore diameter of mesopores ranged between 80 and 110Å, which permitted the easier access 
of HRP molecules because the dimension of the native HRP (MW: ~ 44 kDa) in a neutral buffer 
solution was predicated as 62 × 43 × 12 (Å)3 by a scanning tunneling microscopy (STE) (Zhang et 
al., 1996). Meanwhile, the average pore diameter of SBA-15 estimated by BJH method was ca. 76Å 
(Table 1) that was below the major pore size distribution (80~110Å), suggesting the presence of 
micro-channels in the interior of SBA-15. 
 
3.2 Immobilization of HRP in SBA-15 mesopores 
When compared with SBA-15, the total specific surface area and the total pore volume of 
 10
applied (data not shown), the electrode exhibited the similar surface morphology as that of 
SBA-15/PANI/Pt electrode in Fig. 2c, however, the stability was relatively poorer than that of 
GA/SBA-15(HRP)/PANI/Pt electrode and the comparison was further discussed later. 
 
3.4 Electrochemical response of electrodes towards H2O2 
Fig.3 showed the cyclic voltammograms of electrodes in response to 3.86 mM of H2O2 in 0.1 
M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2). The PANI modified Pt electrode displayed considerable cathodic 
response to H2O2, as represented by line (a) in Fig. 3, and was similar to our previous publication 
(Chen and Gu, 2008). The deposition of unloaded SBA-15 on the PANI film decreased the peak 
current (line (b) in Fig. 3), implicating the reduction of conductivity due to the electronically 
insulating SBA-15 particles on the PANI film. However, the immobilization of SBA-15(HRP) on 
the PANI film dramatically enhanced the cathodic response as expected (line (c) in Fig. 3). 
According to the results shown in Fig. 1 and table 1, the mesopores of SBA-15 provided the 
electro-active proteins with an unique environment that might prevent protein aggregation during 
immobilization. A recent publication has demonstrated that the SBA-15 mesoporous materials 
accelerated the electron transfer between the entrapped enzyme and electrode (Dai et al., 2008). The 
similar conclusions were also made for other mesoporous silica (Dai et al., 2005; Dai et al., 2007; 
Liu and Hu, 2007) and the electron hopping mechanism was proposed to facilitate the electron 
transfer inside silica mesopores (Fattakhova-Rohlfing et al., 2005; Walcarius, 2005; Budny et al., 
2006; Dai et al., 2008).

thin film as indicated by Fig. 2d. Meanwhile, the improvement of PANI film stability was probably 
ascribed to the filling of SBA-15 in the matrix of PANI network as shown in Figs. 2c and 2d. 
 The entrapment of enzyme in the mesopores of SBA-15 has been proposed by means of the 
electrostatic interaction, simple adsorption, and entrapment (Essa et al., 2007), therefore the 
interactions between enzyme and the inorganic inner pore surface of SBA-15 were not tight enough. 
In this study, the loaded SBA-15 was rinsed with phosphate buffer for several times until no 
measurable leach of HRP was detectable based on the Bradford assay as well as ABTS enzymatic 
assay. However, the significant reductions of cathodic responses for both SBA-15(HRP)/PANI/Pt 
and GA/SBA-15(HRP)/PANI/Pt were still observed after the initial cyclic voltammetric 
measurement, in which were partially resulted from the exclusion of enzyme molecules by the 
electrostatic repulsion. Nevertheless, the SBA-15 loaded with HRP provided the PANI/Pt electrode 
with not only an enhanced sensitivity but also an improved stability, in which could be further 
improved by employing glutaraldehyde. 
 
4. Conclusions 
We have presented a new strategy for the fabrication of hydrogen peroxide biosensor based on 
entrapping HRP in mesoporous SBA-15 and depositing on a PANI modified Pt electrode. Our 
results indicated that the synthetic SBA-15 particle possessed well-defined pore geometry and high 
internal surface area that was able to enhance the physical adsorption of enzyme molecules. The 
proper pore size distribution of SBA-15 was suitable for the entrapment of HRP and maintaining its
