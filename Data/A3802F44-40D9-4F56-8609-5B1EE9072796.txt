ABSTRACT 
This is a report of a three-year project to conduct research and development of 
novel multiport microwave network measurement techniques on the basis of using 
vector network analyzer (VNA) and their applications for microwave imaging and 
microwave circuit calibration. 
For microwave imaging applications, based on two-port VNA, three measurement 
systems are designed for quasi-monostaitc, bistatic and multistatic frequency-swept 
microwave imaging. Firstly, in Chapter 2, a quasi-monostatic frequency-swept 
microwave imaging system using multi-source illumination is proposed to have an 
efficient scattered field acquisition arrangement. Furthermore, the measurement system, 
calibration method and experimental results are presented. In order to implement the 
two-source and two-receiver multistatc arrangement, in Chapter 3, a new four-port test 
set is developed to connect with VNA for multistatic microwave imaging. In Chapter 4, 
the principle, measurement system, calibration and experimental results of bistatic 
microwave imaging in a multi-source illumination arrangement are presented. The 
experimental results shown in Chapter 2, 3 and 4 demonstrate that the three 
cost-effective imaging systems developed in this dissertation can improve the image 
resolution, object aspect angle and the efficiency of Fourier-domain data acquisition in 
comparison with the microwave imaging system using monostatic or bistatic 
arrangement with single-source illumination. 
For microwave circuit calibration applications, four novel calibration techniques 
are proposed in Chapter 5 to solve the difficulties in microwave circuit measurements 
using VNA. Firstly, a new test set with two-port stimulus is developed to avoid the 
switch leakage errors. Instead of TRL (thru, reflection, line) self-calibration procedure 
with limited frequency range, this test set exploits the wideband on-wafer TAN (thru,

1.3 and the chapter outlines are listed in Section 1.4. 
1.1  Research Motivation 
1.1.1  Introduction of Vector Network Analyzer 
In general, VNA is used to measure S-parameters of microwave active and 
passive devices. The VNA monitors the incident signal into the DUT, reflection 
signal outward the DUT and transmission signal through the DUT. For reflection 
measurement, dividing the reflection signal to incident signal is for calculating the 
return loss, standing wave ratio, reflection coefficient and input impedance. For 
transmission measurement, dividing the transmission signal to incident signal is 
for calculating the insertion loss, gain and transmission coefficient. Figure 1-1 [4] 
shows the block diagram of conventional two-port VNA system and the function 
of each subsystem is described in the following. 
(a) Source provides RF signals to stimulate the DUT.  
(b) Signal-separation hardware allows measurements of a portion of the incident 
signal to provide a reference for ratio measurements, and separates the 
incident and reflection signal presented at the input of the DUT. Hardware for 
this purpose includes power dividers, directional couplers and directional 
bridges.

monostatic arrangement or ISAR (inverse synthetic aperture radar) arrangement. 
Figure 1-2 shows an automated wideband monostatic microwave imaging 
measurement system using two-port VNA. 
In general, high resolution and wide aspect angle are the main design 
requirements of a microwave imaging system. Therefore, it is essential to acquire 
enough object scattering information at different frequencies, receiving and 
illumination angles. To accomplish this, three novel microwave imaging 
measurement systems for quasi-monostatic, bistatic and multistatic arrangements 
are developed in this study. 
1.1.3  VNA in Microwave Circuit Calibration 
At microwave frequencies, systematic effects such as switches and coupler 
leakages, test port mismatch and frequency response will affect the measured data. 
However, in a stable measurement environment these effects are repeatable and 
can be calibrated. This process of VNA is called the measurement system 
calibration. The most common calibration methods for the two-port VNA are 
SOLT (short, open, load, thru) calibration procedure [5], [6] and TRL (thru, 
reflection, line) calibration procedure [7].  
For SOLT calibration procedure, a series of known devices, such as open, 
short and load standards, are connected. The systematic effects are determined as 
the difference between the measured and known responses of the standards. After

frequency range [8], [9]. It finds applications in imaging radar [10]-[13], remote 
sensing [14], nondestructive evaluation [15], [16], antenna [17], [18] and 
biological diagnoses [19], [20], and target identification [21] etc., because 
microwaves can penetrate fog, cloud, and a variety of dielectric materials.  
The theory of monostatic microwave imaging for perfectly conducting 
objects based on Bojarski’s identity was described in [8], [9]. Under physical 
optics approximation, the object scattered far field and its microwave image forms 
a Fourier transform pair. For image resolution improvement, the frequency and 
angular diversity techniques [22], [23] are used to enlarge the area of scattering 
object Fourier-domain data. In the monostatic scattering arrangement, or ISAR 
(inverse synthetic aperture radar) [10], the frequency-swept object scattering 
information is acquired by rotating the scattering object at the corresponded 
transmitting/receiving direction, then recording the object scattered far field in a 
sequential format. In other words, a line of Fourier-domain data corresponded to 
one object rotation angle is acquired using frequency diversity technique, and a 
two-dimensional polar format of the object Fourier-domain data can be obtained 
by using frequency and angular diversity techniques. 
Under the physical optics approximation [24], [25], the theory based on 
Bojarski’s identity was extended to the general multistatic case [26]. In this 
arrangement, the scattering object is illuminated by a single source and the 
scattered far field is recorded by multiple receivers (i.e., receiver diversity 
 6
TSD (thru, short, delay) [31] and TRL (thru, reflect, line) [32] self-calibration 
procedures are commonly used for on-wafer S-parameter calibration. However, 
the available calibration frequency bandwidth is limited by the calibrators. 
Multiline calibration [33] and TAN self-calibration [34], [35] are methods suitable 
for wideband calibration. Hence, to overcome the limitation of the available 
calibration frequency bandwidth, the TAN self-calibration procedure, originally 
developed for components with sexless connectors (APC-7), is valuable to apply 
for on-wafer wideband system calibration. This calibration procedure is shown to 
be suitable to calibrate the two-port stimulus test set due to the use of three 
two-port calibrators. 
1.2.2.2  Differential-Type Discontinuity Measurement 
Recently the differential lines are increasingly adopted to suppress the 
ground bounce noise introduced in multi-layer PCB (printed circuit board). In 
circuit layout of differential signal lines, the discontinuity structure is inevitable. It 
will then introduce mode-conversion signals (differential-mode to 
common-mode), and causes SI (signal integrity) problems. Conventionally the 
circuit models extracted from TDR/TDT (time domain reflectometry/time domain 
transmission) measurement data are used to predict the effects of differential-type 
discontinuities. The accuracy of time-domain measurement then depends on the 
calibration of time-domain VNA [36], [37]. However, until now, the differential

characteristics of transition and the two connected transmission lines. 
1.2.2.4  Multi-port Calibration Technique 
The through-short-delay (TSD) calibration method for n-port scattering 
parameter measurements with leakage errors is shown in [45] and demonstrated 
with the two-port measurement results. Based on this calibration method, the 
embedding and de-embedding equations in matrix form for the error model with 
no-leakage are formulated in [46], [47]. For calibrating a two-port VNA and test 
fixture, it uses one-port standards, an open or a short, and two-port standards, 
through line and delay line. In [48], a general formulation of the multi-port VNA 
calibration procedure is presented and experimentally demonstrated that a 
three-port VNA can be calibrated using a two-port through and a one-port sliding 
load with sexless connectors. However, using one-port and two-port calibrators to 
calibrate a multi-port VNA may become cumbersome and easily confusable due to 
the complicated port-to-calibrator connections. To simplify the calibration 
procedures, one can use three n-port calibrators to calibrate an n-port VNA to 
remove the error coefficients in a no-leakage error model [49]. 
1.3  Contribution 
This report presents three novel experimental arrangements and their 
formulations in microwave imaging and develops four calibration techniques in 
 10
Thirdly, besides extending a two-port VNA to a multi-port instrument, a linear 
receiving array is utilized to develop bistatic microwave imaging system using 
multi-source illumination [52], [53]. The developed microwave imaging system is 
an effective approach to yield microwave images of scattering objects with a wide 
aspect angle. The principle, measurement system, calibration and experimental 
results of microwave diversity imaging of conducting objects in a multi-source 
illumination arrangement are presented in Chapter 4. 
For microwave circuit calibration applications, four microwave circuit 
calibration techniques are developed in Chapter 5 for calibrating two-port 
stimulus test set, measuring differential-type discontinuities, characterizing 
flip-chip interconnect and calibrating three-port VNA. 
Firstly, in Section 5.1 a new test set with two-port stimulus is developed to 
avoid the switch leakage errors [54]. Instead of TRL calibration procedure with 
limited frequency range, this test set exploits the wideband on-wafer TAN 
calibration procedure [55] to correct the measurement systematic errors. Secondly, 
the differential TRL calibration procedure [56] is developed in Section 5.2 for the 
differential-type discontinuity measurement. In order to evaluate the performance 
of a single flip-chip interconnect in Section 5.3, the TRL and LRL (short line, 
reflection, long line) calibration procedures are combined as a two-step 
de-embedding procedure [57], [58] to measure the characteristics of flip-chip 
interconnects. Finally, in Section 5.4 a novel three-port calibration method using 
 12
presented. 
In Chapter 5, four novel microwave circuit calibration techniques are 
developed for calibrating two-port stimulus test set, measuring differential-type 
discontinuities, characterizing the performance of a single flip-chip interconnect 
and calibrating a three-port VNA. 
Finally, some conclusions are given in Chapter 6.

system to be an effective approach as compared with the conventional monostatic 
arrangement. 
2.1  Formulation 
The quasi-monostatic backscattering geometry using illumination diversity 
technique is shown in Fig. 2-1 (a). Note, only two-source illumination is shown for 
the simplicity of illustration. In the following derivation, an infinitely long 
scattering object in the z-direction (normal to the x-y plane) is assumed and 
multiple normally incident TM-polarized plane waves are generated by multiple 
transmitting antennas in the far-field region. 
The incident field for multi-source illumination is written as

are connected with an Agilent 8722ES network analyzer to provide proper signal 
amplification. A personal computer is linked to the measurement system for 
positioner rotation, instrument control, system calibration, and data recording.  
In the measurement, the frequency is stepped from 7.5 to 12.5 GHz for 51 
frequency points to give 57.1min =k  rad/cm and 62.2max =k  rad/cm. The 
scattering object is located on a positioner with rotation angles listed in Table 2-1. 
In each range of rotation angle there are 15 rotation angles. For example, initially 
°= 01θ , °= 302θ  and °−= 303θ  for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd transmitting antennas. 
Hence the corresponded directions of ,  and  are at ,  and . 
As the object is rotated from  to , the angular range of corresponded 
Fourier-domain data is from  to  with  span angle. Therefore, one 
can sequentially rotate the scattering object based on the eight ranges given in 
Table 2-1 to synthesize a total of  Fourier-domain data with  interval. On 
the other hand, in the ISAR arrangement with only one transmitting antenna, 360 
object rotation angles with  interval are needed. Therefore, one can effectively 
reduce the object rotation angles by three times using a three-source arrangement.

In the measurement, the three attenuators are electronically set to the values in

Based on the calibration equations (2.15), (2.17) and (2.18), the calibration 
and measurement procedures are summarized as the following. 
1. Measure the room clutter response for all the measurement states. 
2. Position the reference object and measure the quasi-monostatic 
frequency-swept scattered fields in all measurement states, then subtract room 
clutter response for each measurement state.  
3. Locate the test object and measure the quasi-monostatic frequency-swept 
scattered fields in all measurement states and at all object rotation angles. 
Calibrate the object Fourier-domain data using (2.15), then extract its 
corresponding Fourier-domain data using (2.18). 
4. Correctly locate all the extracted Fourier-domain data, then use the

however only a partial Fourier-domain data is obtained without using illumination 
diversity technique. The reconstructed images are shown in Fig. 2-5 (a) and (b), 
respectively. A complete circle image is given using three-source illumination, but 
a fragmental image shows the scattering centers obtained without using 
illumination diversity technique. The scattering centers [61] are those scatterers on 
the object surface caused by the illumination of incident fields and observed by the 
receiving antennas. 
For the second type of test object, the range of ka  is 2.4-3.9 radians, hence 
the thin cylinders can be treated as four line scatterers. Measured results of 
Fourier-domain data and reconstructed image are shown in Fig. 2-6 and Fig. 2-7. 
The reconstructed image is shown in good agreement with the distribution of four 
thin cylinders given in Fig. 2-3 (b).  
The range of the Fourier-domain data shown in Fig. 2-6 (a) for three-source 
illumination arrangement is about xp∆ =2 rad/cm and yp∆ =2 rad/cm. The 
corresponding resolution then gives about 3 cm in both x- and y-directions. 
However, the area of the Fourier-domain data shown in Fig. 2-6 (b) for 
single-source illumination case is one-third of that in Fig. 2-6 (a), hence its 
resolution is about three times worse in x- and y-directions as shown in Fig. 2-7 (b). 
Therefore, for the same object rotation angles, the quasi-monostatic 
frequency-swept microwave imaging system using illumination diversity

Fourier-domain data. In addition, this technique can be potentially applied to the 
multistatic microwave imaging by using multi-source illumination and multiple 
coherent receivers. This will then further greatly improve the image resolution in a 
more cost-effective approach to be described in the next chapter.

3.1  Formulation 
By adding a receiving antenna in the quasi-monostatic backscattering 
geometry using two-source illumination shown in Fig. 2-1 (a), the multistatic 
backscattering geometry with two sources and two receivers is shown in Fig. 3-1 
(a). In this arrangement, the two transmitting antennas are used to simultaneously 
transmit two incident plane waves and the object scattered field is simultaneously 
received by two receiving antennas. 
Based on (2.1), the incident field for two-source illumination can be written 
as

Assuming that the locations of transmitting antenna and receiving antenna 
fulfill the physical optics approximation [24], from (2.3), the scattered fields 
contributed from two sources at two receiving antennas are given as

Note that in the experimental arrangement shown in Fig. 2-2, since three 
transmitting antennas are arranged with equally spacing angles and the receiving 
antenna is fixed on the negative X-axis, as  is stepped from  to , three 
lines of Fourier-domain data would lie with equally spacing angles. Acquiring 
multiple lines of Fourier-domain data with equal spacing angle is then an effective 
approach to fill the Fourier-domain space.

To accomplish this in the multistatic arrangement shown in Fig. 3-1 (a), the 
locations of transmitting and receiving antennas are properly designed to acquire 
four lines of Fourier-domain data with equally spacing angles. The 1st transmitting 
and 1st receiving antennas are on the negative X-axis. The 2nd transmitting and 2nd 
receiving antennas are at 1θ  and 2θ , respectively. The Fourier-domain data 
contributed from all these sources and receivers are then projected along the four

rotation angles. Therefore, from the scattering object rotation angle mφ  and the 
angle ijϕ  between the i-th receiver and j-th source, one can correctly and 
effectively locate the extracted Fourier-domain data ijO
~  solved from (3.17) and 
(3.19) in the Fourier-domain space using (3.9) with the use of multistatic 
arrangement. In the following section, the experimental measurement system and 
the calibration method to acquire the scattering object Fourier-domain data will be 
described. 
3.2  Measurement System and Calibration Method 
3.2.1  Measurement System 
Figure 3-2 (a) shows the developed experimental multistatic microwave 
imaging system. The 1st and 2nd transmitting antennas are located at about  and 
 for simultaneously transmitting swept-frequency microwave signals. The 
1
°0
°− 20
st and 2nd receiving antennas are at about and  for collecting the object 
scattered field. All the transmitting and receiving antennas are in the far-field 
region. These antennas are connected to a four-port vector network analyzer 
system consisting of a novel four-port test set, an HP8341B synthesized sweeper 
and an HP8510C network analyzer. A personal computer is linked to the 
measurement system for positioner rotation, instrument control, system 
°0 °10
 52
receiving antennas are at  and . Hence the corresponded directions of , 
, and  are at , ,  and . As the object is rotated from  
to , the angular range of corresponded Fourier-domain data is from  to 
 with  span angle. Therefore, one can sequentially rotate the scattering 
object based on the 18 different angular ranges given in Table 3-1 to synthesize a 
total of  Fourier-domain data with  interval. On the other hand, in the 
ISAR arrangement with only one pair of transmitting and receiving antennas, a 
total of 360 object rotation angles with  interval is needed. Therefore, one can 
effectively reduce the object rotation angles by four times using this multistatic 
arrangement with two transmitting antennas and two receiving antennas. Further 
rotation angle reduction can be achieved with more transmitting and receiving 
antennas involved.

In the measurement, two wideband phase shifters are electronically set to the 
values in Table 3-2 corresponding to the three measurement states. One 
measurement state means to record the frequency-swept object scattered field for 
one set of phase shifter values. The measurement sequence is first to record four 
object scattered fields corresponding to four source and receiver pairs at three 
measurement states, then the positioner is rotated to the next object rotation angle 
for the next object scattered field acquirement. After 5 rotation angles, the 
scattering object is rotated to the next range based Table 3-1 until the end of the 
rotation.

Based on the above described measurement system and calibration method, 
this section presents the experimental results of three different types of scattering 
objects as shown in Fig. 2-3. They include a metallic cylinder with 91 cm length 
and 15 cm radius, four distributed metallic thin cylinders with 113 cm length and 
1.5 cm radius as discrete line scatterers and a metal covered B-52 1:100 scaled 
model aircraft. 
In the multistatic measurement arrangement, the scattering object is rotated 
with a total of 90 object rotation angles listed in Table 3-1 to give a total of  
spanned Fourier-domain data with  interval. A thin metallic cylinder with 113 
cm length and 1.5 cm radius is used as a reference object. 
°360
°1
The measured Fourier-domain data of the first type of test object are shown in 
Fig. 3-3 (a) and (b). For comparison, the results using monostatic measurement 
arrangement are also given. The measurement with multistatic arrangement gives 
a  spanned Fourier-domain data, however only a partial Fourier-domain data 
is obtained using monostatic arrangement. The reconstructed images are shown in 
Fig. 3-4 (a) and (b), respectively. A complete circle image is given using 
multistatic arrangement, but a fragmental image is obtained using monostatic 
arrangement. 
°360
Measured results of Fourier-domain data and reconstructed image of the 
second type of test object are shown in Fig. 3-5 and Fig. 3-6. The reconstructed 
image is shown in good agreement with the distribution of four thin cylinders 
 58
are presented in this chapter. In Section 3.1, the image reconstruction formulas for 
multistatic arrangement are developed to acquire the Fourier-domain data for 
image reconstruction in the situation that scattering object is under two-source 
illumination and two-receiver receiving. In Chapter 2, the number of lines of 
Fourier-domain data in the frequency-swept quasi-monostatic arrangement is 
determined by the number of transmitting sources. However, in this chapter, the 
number of source and receiver pairs determines the number of lines of 
Fourier-domain data. In other words, as two sources and two receivers are 
properly arranged to fulfill the physical optics approximation, one can reduce the 
object rotation angle by four times or equivalently improve the angular resolution 
by four times as compared with monostatic arrangement. One can therefore extend 
this result to the case of n pairs of transmitting and receiving antennas in 
multistatic arrangement. In Section 3.2, a novel four-port test set is developed for 
two-source and two-receiver multistatic arrangement. Based on the image 
reconstruction formulas and calibration method, four lines of frequency-swept 
Fourier-domain data can be acquired simultaneously. In addition, in Chapter 2, the 
frequency responses of attenuators in Fig. 2-2 should be known to solve the 
Fourier-domain data iO
~  using (2.13). However, the characteristics of the two 
wideband phase shifters shown in Fig. 3-2 (b) are allowed to be unknown because 
the frequency responses of two phase shifters at different setting values can be

4.1  Formulation 
The purpose of this section is to develop the basic formulation of microwave 
diversity imaging of conducting objects with multi-source illumination in a 
bistatic arrangement. Figure 4-1 shows the scattering geometry with multi-source 
illumination and a backward linear receiving array. In the following derivation, an 
infinitely long scattering object in the z-direction (normal to the x-y plane) is 
assumed and illuminated by multiple normally incident TM-polarized plane 
waves. 
The same incident field for multi-source illumination as (2.1) is given as

Equation (4.12) shows that results of iO

source can be extracted from the scattered field sU~ in the Fourier-domain with a 
known non-singular matrix . Therefore, by superposing all the ][ ijE

long linear scanner at about 40−=x  cm to collect the object scattered field. A 
Hughes 8010H TWTA and an Avantek AWT-18676 LNA are connected with an 
HP8510C network analyzer to provide proper signal amplification. A personal 
computer is linked to the measurement system for receiving probe movement, 
instrument control, system calibration, and data recording.  
In the measurement, the four attenuators are electronically set to be 3dB in 
turn to give four measurement states. The other three attenuators in each 
measurement state are set to be 0dB. One measurement state means to record the 
frequency-swept object scattered field for one set of attenuator values. The 
measurement sequence is first to perform four measurement states, then the 
receiving probe is moved to the next position for the next four measurement states 
until the end of the scanner. The frequency responses of attenuators at each setting 
value are measured before the experiment. Note the consideration on choosing 
attenuator setting values is to give a non-singular matrix  in (4.13), hence 
one may select other values. In addition, since the attenuators are calibrated, their 
setting values will not affect the measurement performance.

4.2.2  Calibration Method 
Based on the calibration procedure of single-source illumination arrangement 
[27] and the plane wave spectrum (PWS) technique [63], the calibration procedure 
for the measurement system given in Fig. 4-2 is described in the following.

Based on the calibration equations (4.15), (4.18) and (4.20), the calibration 
and measurement procedures are summarized as the following. 
1. Measure the room clutter response using linear scanner for all the measurement 
states. 
2. Position the reference object and measure the scattered fields in all 
measurement states, then perform one-dimensional Fourier transformation after 
subtracting room clutter response for each measurement state.  
3. Locate the test object and measure the scattered fields in all measurement states. 
Calibrate the object Fourier-domain data using (4.15), then extract its 
corresponding Fourier-domain data using (4.20). 
4. Use the triangle-based nearest neighbor interpolation method to acquire the 
extracted Fourier-domain data from each illumination source in a rectangular 
 82
simulation results given in Fig. 4-4 (b). Figure 4-5 shows the reconstructed images 
obtained from Fourier-domain data given in Fig. 4-4 (a) and (b), respectively. It is 
indicated that the reconstructed image shown in Fig. 4-5 (a) gives an about  
circular ring image corresponding to the shape of metallic cylinder due to the 
specular diffraction observed by the linear array under four-source illumination.

Figure 4-6 (a) illustrates the Fourier-domain acquired by four-source 
illumination based on (4.6) and (4.10). The boundaries are about –5 rad/cm 
< < –2 rad/cm and –4 rad/cm < < 4 rad/cm. The corresponding resolution 
then gives about 2 cm in x-direction (or range resolution) and 0.8 cm in y-direction 
(or cross-range resolution). Using the four-source illumination distributed at 
, ,  and  in Fig. 4-2 is because this arrangement can effectively 
give about  Fourier-domain range with reasonable small overlapped regions. 
One can increase the Fourier-domain angular range to the limit of  by 
properly enlarging the distribution of illumination source and receiving array. This 
will then yield to the limit of  object aspect angle. Note, a sparser source 
distribution may cause more empty areas in the Fourier-domain.

4.4 Summary 
In this chapter, formulation, measurement system and calibration procedure 
for the bistatic microwave diversity imaging of conducting objects using 
multi-source illumination are presented. They are used to extract the calibrated 
object Fourier-domain data from the measured scattered field in a backward 
scattering arrangement with multi-source illumination.  
The experimental results demonstrate that the developed microwave 
diversity imaging system using multi-source illumination arrangement can yield 
images with a wide object aspect angle and better cross-range resolution than 
those of single-source illumination arrangement. This improvement is achieved by 
basically applying multi-source illumination to extend the area of the induced 
surface current distribution on the scattering object and the boundaries of 
Fourier-domain data in the cross-range direction.

calibration formulations are developed in Section 5.4 to calibrate the three-port 
VNA. 
5.1  TAN Calibration Technique 
In this Section, we propose a new design of the test set without needing a RF 
switch to provide incident RF signals for testing ports. In this approach, it uses 
two-port stimulus to excite the two-port DUT (device under test) simultaneously. 
Similar to the concept of the six-port network analyzer [32], [64], multiple sets of 
reflection and transmission signals caused by incident signals with different 
amplitude or phase are recoded to obtain the two-port S-parameters. To eliminate 
the systematic errors, the TAN self-calibration procedure [55], [65] using three 
two-port calibrators is adopted for a wideband on-wafer system measurement. The 
new developed test set and basic principle of TAN self-calibration calibration 
procedure are described in Section 5.1.1. The measured results using the new test 
set with TAN self-calibration procedure are shown in Section 5.1.2. They are then 
compared with those using HP 8516 test set with SOLT calibration. 
5.1.1  Two-Port Stimulus Test Set 
The system block diagram of the new test set is shown in Fig. 5-1. The power 
splitter (HP 11667B) divides the incident power equally for two-port stimuli 
whose power levels are controlled by two stepping attenuators (HP 8494B). Two

then be obtained to solve the variables , , and 
12 / ab

attenuator values. 
Figure 5-2 shows the error model of TAN self-calibration method [65]. The 
measurement matrix M  can be expressed as a cascade of three two-port networks 
expressed in transmission matrices ( A , T  and 1−B ) as  
1−= ATBM .                                                 (5.5)

5.2  Differential TRL Calibration Technique 
In this section, a novel differential TRL calibration procedure is developed to 
measure the characteristics of differential-type discontinuities, such as a 90o 
differential bend shown in Fig. 5.10 (a). In this calibration procedure, the four-port 
standard S-parameter matrixes of three differential TRL calibrators and DUT are 
measured using a four-port VNA, and then transferred to mixed-mode 
S-parameter matrixes for acquiring the two-port differential S-parameter matrixes 
 102
the four ports of the DUT. The calibration described in this section is mainly 
developed for the case of a four-port DUT excited by differential signals. In other 
words, the DUT characteristics of interest is its differential-mode S-parameter 
submatrix . Hence, the error model of two-port TRL calibration illustrated in 
Fig. 5-10 (b) can be applied to de-embed the characteristics of a differential-type 
DUT. 
ddS
5.2.2  Results 
In the following, both simulated and measured results are presented. In the 
simulation, the complete circuit including differential line and DUT shown in Fig. 
5-10 (b) can be expressed in transmission parameters as 
1−= ADBM .                                          (5.15) 
M  is the simulated transmission matrix of complete circuit. The differential lines, 
represented as error boxes A  and 1−B , are calculated by IE3D full-wave EM 
software [68] with four ports excited as Fig. 5-10 (b). After performing inverse 
matrix operation, the characteristics D  of differential-type discontinuity is 
retrieved. 
In the measurement, the schematics of three differential TRL calibrators and 
two devices under test, a differential bend and a gap, are shown in Fig. 5-11. In 
order to solder four 3.5mm female SMA connectors, the 100Ω differential line 
with 2mm signal line width and 1mm slot width is tapered by four 50  Ω

procedure, with the 1st step to be TRL calibration, and the 2nd step to be LRL 
calibration. In Section 5.3.1, this two-step de-embedding technique is described. 
The measured results of the scale-up flip-chip interconnects are demonstrated in 
Section 5.3.2. 
5.3.1  Flip-Chip Interconnect Measurement 
Figure 5-16 (a) and (b) shows the perspective view and top view of the 
flip-chip interconnect. Conventionally, two identical interconnects are connected 
back-to-back shown in Fig. 5-16 (c) in the measurement. It, however, is difficult to 
extract the true characteristics of a single flip-chip interconnect. In the following, a 
two-step de-embedding procedure is described to measure the characteristics of 
single flip-chip interconnect. 
The three flip-chip circuits used in the two-step de-embedding procedure are 
shown in Fig. 5-17. In this figure, a conventional flip-chip interconnect without 
compensation shown in Fig. 5-18 (a) and a locally matched flip-chip interconnect 
[42] shown in Fig. 5-18 (b) are implemented at the right and left ends of each 
flip-chip circuit. The 1st step in de-embedding procedure is to perform TRL 
calibration [32] to shift the measurement reference planes to the positions of the 
interconnects. Then three calibrated flip-chip circuits are used as the three 
calibrators, “short line”, “reflection” and “long line” in the LRL calibration 
procedure [69] shown in Fig. 5-19. In the 2nd step of de-embedding procedure, two 
 106
thickness HC =HM=127µm and its dielectric constant εr is 10.2. 
Three 20 times scale-up TRL calibrators and flip-chip circuits with short-line, 
reflection and long-line chips are fabricated using εr =10.2 RT/Duroid 6010LM 
board. The bumps between the chip and the motherboard are implemented with 
copper cylinders of 2.5mm radius and 5mm height. Figure 5-20 (a) and (b) show 
the pictorial views of scale-up three TRL calibrators with three flip-chip circuits. 
Based on the two-step de-embedding procedure described in Section 5.3.1, 
the flip-chip circuits are measured in the 20 times scale-down frequency range 
from 0.2GHz to 1.6GHz. Figure 5-21 and 5-22 show the measured characteristics 
of the conventional and locally matched flip-chip interconnects compared with 
those simulated by Sonnet. They are shown in a reasonable agreement. 
Since the difference between l1 and l2 equals to the quarter-wave length of the 
center frequency, the short-line calibrator is ambiguous to the long-line calibrator 
at the low and high frequency ends. Hence, the measurement stop frequency is 
limited to the 8 times of the start frequency. 
5.4  Three-Port Calibration Technique 
In this section, three three-port calibrators extended from two-port TAN 
calibrators [34] are developed to calibrate a three-port VNA. The three-port 
calibrators and their corresponding embedding and de-embedding equations are 
described in Section 5.4.1. Section 5.4.2 shows the measured results of a

5.4.2  Results 
The DUT used to verify the developed calibration method is an HP 11667B 
power splitter. The three-port uncalibrated data for de-embedding are measured by 
an Agilent E5071B VNA. For comparison with two-port calibration procedure, 
the DUT is also measured by the VNA calibrated with an Agilent N4431A 
electronic calibration module (E-Cal). The measured results using the developed 
three-port calibrators are shown in Fig. 5-25 to 5-27. The results are shown in a 
good agreement with those using E-Cal. 
5.5 Summary 
 112
may provide a new concept for designing a multi-port vector network analyzer. 
In Section 5.2, the differential TRL calibration procedure is developed to 
measure the characteristics of differential-type discontinuities. Based on the 
transformation between the standard S-parameter and mixed-mode S-parameter, 
the differential-mode S-parameter matrixes can be acquired by applying 
conventional two-port TRL calibration procedure. In Section 5.2.2, the 
experimental results measured with differential TRL calibration are verified with 
the simulated results. 
In Section 5.3, a new method of measuring a single flip-chip interconnect 
using two-step de-embedding procedure is developed. The measured results 
shown in Section 5.3.2 effectively demonstrate that the developed procedure is a 
practical approach to measure the characteristics of a single flip-chip interconnect. 
In Section 5.4, three three-port calibrators are developed to calibrate a 
three-port VNA. Furthermore, based on the 12-term error model with no-leakage 
errors, the embedding and de-embedding equations for three-port calibrators are 
formulated. The measured results demonstrate that the calibration procedure using 
multi-port calibrators is an effective method to calibrate a multi-port VNA.

frequency-swept microwave imaging system using multi-source illumination can 
be implemented using this extended VNA system. As the transmitting and 
receiving antennas are properly arranged to fulfill the physical optics 
approximation, multiple lines of Fourier-domain data can be simultaneously 
acquired at each rotation angle. The image reconstruction formulation, 
measurement system, calibration method and experimental results are described in 
Chapter 2. The experimental results demonstrate that this microwave imaging 
system improves the efficiency of Fourier-domain data acquirement and image 
resolution. 
Secondly, in Chapter 3, the illumination diversity technique developed in 
Chapter 2 is applied to develop a multistatic frequency-swept microwave imaging 
system with two sources and two receivers. A new four-port test set is designed 
with the use of VNA for developing this imaging system. It then becomes more 
cost-effective than the monostatic arrangement because four transmission 
responses can be acquired simultaneously using this multistatic arrangement. In 
other words, a total of four lines of Fourier-domain data can be acquired to 
reconstruct the image. The image reconstruction formulation, measurement 
system, calibration method and experimental results are described in Chapter 3. 
Thirdly, a linear receiving array is combined with the extended VNA system 
shown in Chapter 2 to develop a bistatic frequency-swept microwave imaging 
system using multi-source illumination. Multiple illumination sources are 
 142
leakage errors caused by RF switch can be eliminated. The wideband on-wafer 
TAN calibration procedure is applied to calibrate this test set in order to overcome 
the limitation of the available calibration frequency bandwidth using TRL 
calibration procedure.  
Secondly, the differential TRL calibration procedure is developed to measure 
the characteristics of differential-type discontinuities. Based on the transformation 
between the standard S-parameters and mixed-mode S-parameters, the two-port 
differential-mode S-parameter matrix can be extracted from the four-port 
measurement results. Then two-port TRL calibration can be applied to obtain the 
characteristics of differential-type DUT with user defined reference planes. 
Thirdly, combining TRL and LRL calibration, a two-step de-embedding 
procedure is developed to measure the characteristics of a single flip-chip 
interconnect. This method is a practical approach and valuable to measure the 
characteristics of transition circuits instead of the conventional back-to-back 
arrangement. 
Finally, in Chapter 5, three-port calibrators are developed to calibrate the 
three-port VNA. Moreover, the embedding and de-embedding equations for this 
calibration procedure are derived. The experimental results demonstrate that the 
calibration procedure using multi-port calibrators is an effective method to 
calibrate a multi-port VNA. 
Four novel calibration techniques presented in this report can then enhance 
 144
multi-port test set is then connected with network analyzer to form a multi-port 
VNA. Using this multi-port VNA is a more general approach to measure the 
differential-type or balanced-type devices than the pure-mode VNA in [65]. In 
addition, the three-port VNA calibration using three-port calibrators and the 
differential TRL calibration developed in Chapter 5 can be extended to calibrate 
this multi-port VNA. 
Thirdly, the multiple access schemes in wireless communication systems 
such as FDM (frequency division multiplexing), CDM (code division 
multiplexing) and OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) should 
have the potential to replace the attenuators and wideband phase shifters used in 
Chapters 2, 3 and 4 to extract the Fourier-domain data contributed from each 
illumination source. In addition, the development of self-calibration technique in 
microwave imaging system without using a reference scattering object may be 
feasible in the use of multiple sets of scattered fields. 
Finally, the image reconstruction formulation and scattered field extraction 
techniques of the quasi-monostatic, bistatic and multistatic microwave imaging 
systems developed in this work can be applied to the cases of dielectric objects or 
conducting objects coated with dielectric layers. This kind of microwave imaging 
system is useful in nondestructive evaluation and buried object detection.
