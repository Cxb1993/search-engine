英文摘要
(Keywords: channel-matched source
decoding, distributed speech recognition,
channel error mitigation)
The purpose of this two-year research is to
develop a human-machine interface that allows
cellular-phone users to use voice-controlled
commands to access the remote information
server through GSM network. The basic strategy
is a distributed speech recognition (DSR) system,
in which speech parameters extracted from a
mobile terminal are transmitted through a GSM
data channel to a remote speech recognizer. To
meet the GSM 4.8kb/s data coding requirement,
speech parameters are grouped into pairs and
compressed via a split vector quantizer whose
indices are used for codebook lookup at the
receiver. The ETSI DSR standard includes a
basic error mitigation algorithm that has shown
degraded performance in poor channel
conditions. Recognizing this, we attempt to
capitalize more fully on both the residual source
redundancy and the channel memory and then
develop new mitigation algorithms with
increased robustness against channel errors.
When designing an MMSE source decoder, its
effectiveness depends on how well error
characteristics are incorporated into the
calculation of a posteriori probabilities of each
index. A channel model should be representative
enough to characterize GSM error patterns and
yet it should not be analytically complicated. The
commonly used probability recursions are based
on the index-level and hence can only be applied
for the simplified Gilbert model. For further
improvement, we developd a Fritchman model
representative of GSM errors and then develop
bit-level probability recursions for Fritchman
model. Another important issue to address is the
source-controlled channel decoding, where
residual redundancy of DSR speech parameters
was analyzed and exploited in the soft-output
channel decoder as a priori information of the
source. Our goal is to modify the BCJR decoding
algorithm, which was derived under memoryless
channel assumption, so that its soft output can
effectively exploit both the residual source
redundancy and channel memory information.
Finally, we investigated the DSR experiments of
a complete GSM simulation using CoCentric
GSM library.

encoded information and consequently leads to degraded recognition performance. In the case of packet-
erasure channels, several packet loss compensation techniques such as interpolation [2] and error control
coding [3] have been introduced for DSR. For wireless channels, joint source-channel decoding (JSCD)
techniques [4]-[6] have been shown effective for error mitigation using the source residual redundancy
and assisted with the bit reliability information provided by the soft-output channel decoder. However, the
usefulness of these techniques may be restricted because they only exploited the bit-level source
correlation on the basis of a memoryless AWGN channel assumption.
In this paper, we attempt to capitalize more fully on the a priori knowledge of source and channel and
then develop a DSR system with increased robustness against channel errors. The first step toward
realization is to use quantizer indexes rather than single index-bits as the bases for the JSCD, since the
dependencies of quantizer indexes are stronger than the correlations of the index-bits. The next knowledge
source to be exploited is the channel error characteristics. Transmission errors encountered in most real
communication channels exhibit various degrees of statistical dependencies that are contingent on the
transmission medium and on the particular modulation technique used. A typical example occurs in digital
mobile radio channels, where speech parameters suffer severe degradation from error bursts due to the
combined effects of fading and multipath propagation. A standard technique for robust VQ over a channel
with memory is to use interleaving to render the channel memoryless and then design a decoding
algorithm for the memoryless channel. This approach, however, often introduces large decoding delays
and does not utilize the channel memory information. Further improvement can be realized through a
more precise characterization of the channel on which the decoder design is based [7]. For this
investigation, we focused on the two-state Markov chain model proposed by Gilbert [8]. This model has
several practical advantages over the Gaussian channel [4]-[6] and binary Markov channels [9]. First, the
Gilbert model is relatively simple and can characterize a wide range of digital channels, as evidenced by
Due to constraints on coding complexity and delay, the VQ encoder exhibits considerable redundancy
within the encoded index sequence, either in terms of a non-uniform distribution or in terms of correlation.
Table 1 shows the entropy for each DSR feature pair. From it we see that the index sequence contains
residual redundancy in the form of a first-order Markov process with transition probabilities P(ut | ut-1),
which can be measured once in advance by processing a training speech database by the DSR front-end.
For error protection individual index-bits are fed into a binary convolutional encoder consisting of M shift
registers. The register shifts one bit at a time and its state is determined by the M most recent inputs. After
channel encoding, the code-bit combination corresponding to the quantizer index ut is denoted by xt
=( xt(1), xt(2),…, xt(n)) with the code rate R=k/n.
One of the principal concerns in transmitting VQ data over noisy channels is that channel errors corrupt
the bits that convey information about quantizer indexes. Assume that a channel's input xt and output yt
differ by an error pattern et, so that the received bit combination is yt =( yt(1), yt(2),…,yt(n)) in which yt(l)
= xt(l) et(l), l=1,2,…,n, and  denotes the bitwise modulo-2 addition. At the receiver side, the JSCD
decoder will find the most probable transmitted quantizer index given the received sequence. The
decoding process starts with the formation of a posteriori probability (APP) for each of possibly
transmitted indices ut = i, which is followed by choosing the index value iˆ that corresponds to the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability for that quantizer index. Once the MAP estimate of the
quantizer index is determined, its corresponding codevector becomes the decoded output ˆ tv =
ˆ( )ic . The
APP that a decoded index ut = i can be derived from the joint probability 1( , , )i Tt tP u s y , where st is the
channel encoder state at time t and 1
Ty =( y1, y2,…, yT) is the received sequence from time t=1 through
some time T. We have chosen the length T=24 in compliance with the ETSI bit-streaming format, where
that the sectionalized trellis diagram forms a finite-state machine defined by its state transition function
( , )it tS u s and output function ( , )it tX u s . Viewing from this perspective, the code-bit combination
( , )it t tx X u s is associated with the branch from state st to state 1 ( , )it t ts S u s  if the corresponding
quantizer index at time t is ut = i.
We next modified the BCJR algorithm based on sectionalized trellis to exploit the combined a priori
information of source and channel. We begin our development of the modified BCJR algorithm by
rewriting the joint probability in (1) as follows:

IV. Probability Recursions for Gilbert Channel
Designing a robust DSR system requires that parameterized probabilistic models be used to summarize
some of the most relevant aspects of error statistics. It is apparent from previous work on channel
modelling [7] that we are confronted with contrasting requirements in selecting a good model. A model
should be representative enough to describe real channel behavior and yet it should not be analytically
complicated. To permit theoretical analysis, we assumed that the encoded bits of DSR features were
subjected to the sample error sequences typical of the Gilbert channel [8]. The Gilbert channel model
consists of a Markov chain having an error-free state G and a bad state B, in which errors occur with the
probability (1-h). The state transition probabilities are b and g for the G to B and B to G transitions,
respectively. The model state-transition diagram is shown in Fig. 3. The effective BER produced by the
Gilbert channel is ε = (1-h)b/(g+b). Notice that in the particular case of a Gilbert model with parameter
values b=1, g=0, h=1-ε, the channel model reduces to a memoryless binary symmetric channel with the
BER ε.
The effectiveness of the MAP symbol decoding depends crucially on how well the error characteristics
are incorporated into the calculation of channel transition probabilities P(et|et-1). Although using channel
memory information was previously proposed for MAP symbol decoding [13], their emphasis was placed
upon channels with no interframe memory. When only access to the intraframe memory is available, it
was shown [8] that the channel transition probabilities of the Gilbert channel have closed-form
expressions that can be represented in terms of model parameters {h, b, g}. Under such conditions, we can
proceed the MAP symbol decoding in a manner similar to the work of [13]. Extensions of these results to
channels with both intraframe and interframe memory has been found difficult. Recognizing this, we next
develop a general treatment of probability recursions for the Gilbert channel. The main result is a
V. Experimental Results
Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate three MAP-based error mitigation schemes for DSR
over burst error channels. First a bit-level trellis MAP decoding scheme BMAP is considered that uses the
standard BCJR algorithm to decode the index-bits. The decoders SMAP1 and SMPA2 exploit the symbol-
level source redundancy by using a modified BCJR algorithm based on a sectionalized trellis structure.
The SMAP1 is designed for a memoryless binary symmetric channel, whereas the SMAP2 exploits the
channel memory though the Gilbert channel characterization. The channel transition probabilities to be
used for the SMAP1 is P(et) in (8), and P(et | et-1) in (9) for the SMAP2. For purpose of comparison, we
also investigated an error mitigation scheme [4] which applied the concept of softbit speech decoding
(SBSD) and achieved good recognition performance for AWGN and burst channels. A preliminary
experiment was first performed to evaluate various decoders for reconstruction of the feature pair (C0,logE)
encoded with the DSR front-end. A rate R=1/2 convolutional code with memory order M=6 and the octal
generator (46,72)8 is chosen as the channel code. Table 2 presents the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained
from transmission of the index-bits over Gilbert channel with BER ranging from 10-3 to 10-1. The results
of these experiments clearly demonstrate the improved performance achievable using the SMAP1 and
SMAP2 in comparison to those of BMAP and SBSD. Furthermore, the improvement has a tendency to
increase for noisy channels with higher BER. This indicates that the residual redundancy of quantizer
indexes is better to be exploited at the symbol level to achieve more performance improvement. A
comparison of the SMAP1 and SMAP2 also revealed the importance of matching the real error
characteristics to the channel model on which the MAP symbol decoder design is based. The better
performance of SMAP2 can be attributed to its ability to compute the symbol APP taking interframe and
which uses Gilbert channel characterization for better decoding in addition to source a priori knowledge.
Experiments on Mandarin digit string recognition indicate that the proposed decoder achieved significant
improvements in recognition accuracy for DSR over burst error channels.
