ABSTRACT. Vector quantization was a powerful technique in image
compression. This paper proposed a new method based on the artificial
bee colony algorithm to construct the codebook of vector quantization.
The proposed method uses LBG method as the initial of ABC algorithm to
develop the VQ algorithm. This method is called ABC-LBG algorithm.
Experimental results showed that the ABC-LBG algorithm is more reliable
and the reconstructed images get higher quality compared to other methods.
Keywords: LBG algorithm; Vector quantization, Artificial bee colony
algorithm
1. Introduction. The vector quantization (VQ) technique is a widely-used algorithm for
image compression. The operations of VQ techniques include the partition of the image into
many input vectors (or blocks), and then compare to the codewords of codebook in order to
find its reproduction vector. A well-known method is the LBG algorithm [1]; however, the
LBG algorithm suffers from the serious drawback that its performance depends heavily on the
initial starting conditions. Recently, the evolutionary optimization algorithms had been
developed to design the codebook for improving the results of LGB algorithm. Chen et al [2]
developed an evolutionary particle swarm optimization vector quantization learning scheme
for vector quantization. Horng [3] and Jiang [4] developed a new vector quantization
method based on the honey bee mating optimization.

In the multi-dimensional space, each solution of food source represents a potential
solution to a problem. There exists a fitness evaluation function that assigns a fitness values

3. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for Vector Quantization. The artificial bee
colony (ABC) algorithm was proposed by Karaboga & Basturk [6]. In this algorithm, the
position of a food source ix represents a possible solution to the optimization problems and
the amount of nectar in a food source corresponds to the fitness )( ixfit of the corresponding
solution. The number of employed or onlooker bees is generally equal to the number of
solutions in the population of solutions. Initially, the ABC algorithm randomly produced a
distributed initial population P of SN solutions, where SN denoted the number of employed
bees or onlooker bees. In this section, an artificial bee colony associated with LBG
(ABC-LBG) algorithm is developed based on the meta-heuristic approach proposed by
Karaboga [15]. In the ABC-LBG algorithm, the solutions (food sources) are represented in the
form of codebook shown as Figure 1.
6If the solution iz is not improved through the Step 2 and Step 3, the itrail value of
solution ix will be increased by 1. If the itrail of solution is more than the predetermined
“limit” the solution ix is considered to be an abandoned solution, meanwhile, the employed
bee will be changed into a scout. The scout randomly produces the new solution by (8) and
then compares the fitness of new solution with that of its old one. If the new solution is better
than the old solution, it is replaced with the old one and set its own itrail into 0. This scout
will be changed into an employed bee. Otherwise, the old one is retained in the memory.

If the cycle is equal to the maximum cycle number (MCN) then the algorithm is finished;
otherwise go to Step 2.
4. Experimental Results and Discussion. The typical experiments for evaluating the
methods used for codebook design are the grayscale image coding. Five 512512 still
images named “LENA”, “PEPPER”, and “BABOON”with pixel amplitude resolution of 8
bits are shown in Fig. 2. In coding an image, the image is completely divided into
immediate and non-overlapping blocks with 44 pixels. Each block is treated as a pattern
input vector with 16 dimensions. Therefore, there exist a total of 16384 vectors to be
encoded in an image. In experiments, eight different codebook sizes that are 8, 16, 32, 64,
128, 256, 512 and 1024 are implemented. We compare the ABC-LBG method with four
different algorithms, including the traditional LBG, the particle swarm optimization
(PSO)-based LBG, the honey bee mating optimization (HBMO)-based LBG and the quantum
particle swarm optimization (QPSO)-based LGB algorithms. The programs of the five
algorithms are designed in language of Visual C++ 6.0 on a personal computer with 2.4GHz
CPU running window XP system. The designed programs of ABC-LBG algorithm are revised
from ones given by the homepage of artificial bee colony algorithm [7]. Three control
parameters of ABC-LBG algorithm need to be predefined that are the number of food
sources which is equal to the number of employed bees or onlooker bees (SN), the value of
8behavior of bee colony, the experimental results reveal that the ABC-LBG is superior to the
HBMO-LBG algorithm in the vector quantization. The reconstructed image using the
designed codebook generated by the ABC-LBG algorithm has higher quality than the other
three methods. This proposed ABC-LBG algorithm can not only significantly improve the
performance of original LBG algorithm but also is superior to other two methods.
5. Conclusions. This paper gives a detailed description of how the artificial bee colony
algorithm is used to implement the vector quantization and enhance the performance of LBG
method. All of our experimental results showed that the ABC-LBG algorithm can increase
the quality of reconstructive images with respect to other four methods such as the traditional
LBG, the PSO-LBG, the QPSO-LBG and HBMO-LBG algorithm. The proposed ABC-LBG
algorithm can provide a better codebook with smallest distortion.

Multilevel Thresholding Selection based on the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for
Image Segmentation
Abstract
Multilevel thresholding is an important technique for image processing and pattern
recognition. The maximum entropy thresholding (MET) has been widely applied in the
literature. In this paper, a new multilevel MET algorithm based on the technology of the
artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed: the maximum entropy based artificial bee
colony thresholding (MEABCT) method. Four different methods are compared to this
proposed method: the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the hybrid
cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm (HCOCLPSO), the Fast Otsu’s
method and the honey bee mating optimization (HBMO). The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed MEABCT algorithm can search for multiple thresholds which
are very close to the optimal ones examined by the exhaustive search method. Compared to
the other four thresholding methods, the segmentation results of using the MEABCT
algorithm is the most, however, the computation time by using the MEABCT algorithm is
shorter than that of the other four methods.

1. Introduction
Thresholding is one of the most important techniques for performing image segmentation.
It is generally simple and computationally efficient. The main objective is to determine a
threshold for bi-level thresholding or several thresholds for multilevel thresholding for image
segmentation. Bi-level thresholding selects only one threshold which separates the pixels
into two classes: multilevel thresholding determines multiple thresholds which divide the
pixels into several groups. In general, the global thresholding methods can be classified as
parametric and nonparametric. These methods select thresholds by optimizing (maximizing or
minimizing) some criterion functions defined from images. In the parametric approaches,
the gray-level distribution of each class has a probability density function that is generally
assumed to obey a Gaussian distribution. These methods of parametric approaches attempt to
estimate of the parameters of distribution that will best fit the given histogram data. It
typically leads to a nonlinear optimization problems of which the solution is computationally
expensive and time-consuming. Killer and Illingwoth (1986) proposed a thresholding
method that approximates the histogram by a mixture of normal distributions and minimizes
the classification error probability. Wang et al. (2008) proposed a method which is rooted in
the Parzen window estimate of the unknown gray value probability density function. The
method can integrate image histogram information with the spatial information about pixels
of different gray levels. Zahara et al. (2005) presented a hybrid optimization scheme for
multiple thresholding by the criteria of Otsu’s minimum within-class variance and Gaussian
function fitting.
Nonparametric approaches find the thresholds that separate the gray-level regions of an
image in an optimal manner based on some discriminating criteria such as the between-class
14
the purpose of search and problems solving has been the context of the emerging area of
swarm intelligence. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm may also be considered as a
typical swarm-based approach for optimization, in which the search algorithm is inspired by
the foraging behavior of bee colonies. The search algorithm has led to the emergence of
collective intelligence of bee swarms consisting of three essential components: food source,
employed foragers and unemployed forages. There are two leading modes of the bee colony
behavior: recruitment to and abandonment of a food source. The unemployed forages are
onlookers and scouts. Karaboga & Basturk (2007) have recently proposed a developed
model of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm that simulated these social behaviors of
honey bees for searching for the numerical optimization problems. Singh (2009) applied the
ABC algorithm, called the ABC-LCMST algorithm, for the leaf-constrained minimum
spanning tree problem. Computational results demonstrated the superiority of the new
algorithm over other approaches such as ant colony algorithm and the tabu search. The
performance of the ABC algorithm on clustering is also compared with set of results of
clustering methods that are given in the work of Karaboga & Basturk (2009).
This paper applies the ABC algorithm to search for the multilevel thresholds using the
maximum entropy (MET) criterion. This proposed method is called the maximum entropy
based artificial bee colony thresholding (MEABCT) algorithm. In the experiments presented
in this paper, the exhaustive search method is conducted to derive the optimal solutions for
comparison with the results generated from MEABCT algorithm. The four different methods,
-- the PSO, the hybrid cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm
(HCOCLPSO), the FastOtsu’smethod, and the MEHBMOT -- are implemented in the several
real images for purposes of comparison.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the artificial bee
colony algorithm. Section 3 presents the proposed MEABCT algorithm. Performance
evaluation and experimental results are presented in detail in Section 4. Finally, some
16
processes of the employed, the onlooker and scout bees. An employed bee modifies the
possible solution depending on the amount of nectar (fitness vale) of the new source (new
solution) by using the Eq. (1).

Where },.....,2,1{ SNk but ik  and },....,2,1{ Dj are randomly selected indexes.
ij is a random number between [-1, 1].
If there is more nectar in new solution is than that in the precious one, the bee
remembers the new position and forgets the old one, otherwise it retains the location of the
previous one. When all employed bees have finished this search process, they deliver the
nectar information and the position of the food sources to the onlooker bees, each of whom
chooses a food source according to a probability proportional to the amount of nectar in that
food source. The probability ip of selecting a food source iz is determined using the
following Eq. (2).

In practical terms, any food source iz (i=1,2,…,SN) sequentially generates a random number
between [0, 1] and if this number is less than ip , an onlooker bee are sent to food source iz
and produces a new solution based on the equation (1). If the fitness of the new solution is
more than the old one, the onlooker memorizes the new solution and shares this information
with other onlooker bees. Otherwise, the new solution will be discarded. The process is
repeated until all onlookers have been distributed to the food sources and produces the
corresponding new solution.
If the position of food source can not be improved through the predetermined number of

In our proposed HEABCT algorithm, we try to obtain this optimum D-dimensional vector
[ Dttt ....,,, 21 ], which can maximize (4). The objective function is also used as the fitness
function of the HEABCT algorithm.
3.2. Maximum entropy artificial bee colony thresholding (MEABCT) algorithm
In this paper, a maximum entropy based artificial bee colony thresholding (MEABCT)
algorithm is developed based on the meta-heuristic approach proposed by Karaboga (2010).
The details of MEABCT algorithm are introduced as follows.
Step 1. Generate the initial population of solutions.
Generate the SN solutions iz ( SNi ,...,2,1 ) with D dimensions denoted by matrix Z.

where jiz , is the jth component value that is restricted into [0,…,L] and the 1,,  jiji zz for
all j. The fitness of all solutions iz is evaluated and then set cycle=1 and the trail number of
each solution iz , itrail , is equal to 0.
Step 2. Place the employed bees on their food sources
20
(6)
where the jzmin, and jzmax, are the minimum and maximum of jth component of all
solutions, the )1,0(rand is a random number generating function that generates the random
number between [0, 1].
Step 5. Record the best solution
In this step, the best solution so far is recorded and increases the cycle by 1.
Step 6. Check the termination criterion
If the cycle is equal to the maximum cycle number (MCN) then the algorithm is finished;
otherwise go to Step 2.
4. Experimental results and comparative performances
We implement the all of the algorithms in Visual C++ 6.0 on a personal computer with
2.4GHz CPU, 1G RAM running window XP system. The designed programs are revised from
ones given by the homepage of artificial bee colony algorithm (Karaboga, 2010). Three
control parameters that are the number of food sources which is equal to the number of
employed bees or onlooker bees (SN), the value of “limit”and the maximum cycle number
(MCN) are set in the colony size (SN) 30, MCN 100, and limit value 100. Tables 1-3 show
that the parameters of the other multilevel thresholding algorithms. Five images named
“LENA”“PEPPER”“BIRD”“CAMERA”and “GOLDHILL”are used for conducting our
experiments. These original test images and their histograms are shown in Fig. 1.
The popular performance indicator, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), is used to
compare the segmentation results by using the multilevel image threshold techniques (Yin,
22
standard for evaluating. This table shows that the number of thresholds increase, the PSNR
and the fitness value are enlarged.
The MEABCT and other four multilevel thresholding methods that are MEHBMOT, PSO,
HCOCLPSO and Fast Otsu’s algorithm are implemented for the purpose of comparisons.
Table 6 shows the selected thresholds of the five test images. It is interesting that the
selected thresholds by the MEABCT algorithm are equivalent (for 2- or 3-threshold problems)
or very close (4- or 5-threshold problem) to the ones MEHBMOT algorithm; nevertheless,
there are significant differences of selected thresholds with regard to the Fast Otsu’s method.
This result reveals that the segmentation results depend heavily on the objective function that
is selected. Furthermore, the thresholds obtained by PSO algorithms in the segmentation of
BIRD image are also distinct from the one of the MEABCT algorithm in 5-level thresholding.
It is possible to reveal that the PSO algorithm is unsuitable to search for thresholds. Table 7
shows the computation time and the corresponding PSNR values of the four different
multilevel thresholding methods. The fitness values of corresponding thresholds are shown in
Table 8. Several aspects are found in the two tables. The computation time of the MEABCT
algorithm is between the MEHBMOT and PSO in the segmentation of LENA, PEPPER and
BIRD images, but the corresponding PSNRs are greater than the ones of the MEHBNOT and
PSO algorithms. As to the segmentation of CAMERA and GOLDHILL images, the time
complexity and PSNR values are superior to other four methods. An aspect is found that the
HCOCLPSO and the Fast Otsu’s method are not acceptable because of the heavy need of
computation times. Finally, from the corresponding the fitness values of selected thresholds
using MEABCT algorithm it appears the fact that the selected thresholds of the MEABCT
algorithm can effectively find the adequate solutions based on the maximum entropy
criterion.

Abstract. Image thresholding is an important technique for image processing and
pattern recognition. The maximum entropy thresholding (MET) has been widely applied.
A new multilevel MET algorithm based on the technology of the artificial bee colony
(ABC) algorithm is proposed in this paper called the maximum entropy based artificial
bee colony thresholding (MEABCT) method. Three different methods, such as the
methods of particle swarm optimization, HCOCLPSO and honey bee mating
optimization are also implemented for comparison with the results of the proposed
method. The experimental results manifest that the proposed MEABCT algorithm can
search for multiple thresholds which are very close to the optimal ones examined by the
exhaustive search method. Meanwhile, the results using the MEABCT algorithm is the
best and its computation time is relatively low compared with other four methods.
Keywords: Maximum entropy thresholding; artificial bee colony algorithm; particle
swarm optimization; honey bee mating optimization.
1 Introduction
Thresholding is one of the most important techniques for performing image segmentation.. The
nonparametric approaches are widely used methods to select for multilevel thresholds. These
approaches find the thresholds that separate the gray-level regions of an image in an optimal
manner based on some discriminating criteria such as the between class variance, entropy and cross
entropy. The popular method, Otsu’s method [1], selected optimal thresholds by maximizing the 
between class variance. However, inefficient formulation of between class variance makes the
methods very time consuming in multilevel threshold selection. To overcome this problem, Liao et
al. [2] proposed a fast recursive algorithm, Fast Otsu’s method, along with a look-up-table to
implement in the application of multilevel thresholding. Kapur et al. [3] proposed a method for
gray-level picture thresholding using the entropy of the histogram. Zhang et al. [4] adopted the
particle swarm optimization algorithm to maximize the entropy for underwater image segmentation.
Madhubanti et al. [5] proposed a hybrid cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm
(HCOCLPSO) based on maximum entropy criterion. Yin [6] developed a recursive programming
techniques to reduce the order of magnitude of computing the multilevel thresholds and further used

j. The fitness of all solutions iz are evaluated and set cycle=1, meanwhile, the trail number of
each solution iz , itrail , is assigned to 0.
Step 2. (Place the employed bees on their food sources)
In the step 2, each employed bee produces a new solution iv by using (3) and tests the fitness
value of the new solution.

random number between [-1, 1]. If the fitness of the new one is higher than that of the previous one,
the employed memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. Otherwise it keeps the old
solution.
Step 3. (Send the onlooker bees on the food sources depending on their nectar amounts)
In this step 3, we first calculate the probability value ip of the solution iz by means of
their fitness values using (4).

An onlooker bee selects a solution to update its solution depending on the probabilities and
determines a neighbor solution around the chosen one. The selection procedure for the first
onlooker, a random number is produced between [0, 1] and if this number is less than 1p , its solution
is selected for updating its solution. Otherwise, the random number is compared with 2p and if less
than that, the second solution is chosen. Otherwise, the third probability of third solution is checked.
This process is repeated until all onlookers are distributed onto solutions. The distributed onlooker
bee updates its own solution like the employed bees does.
Step 4. (Send the scouts to the search area for discovering new food source)
If the solution iz does not be improved through the Step 2 and Step 3, the itrail value of
solution iz will be added by 1. If the itrail of solution is more than the predetermined “limit”, the
solution iz is regarded to be an abandoned solution, meanwhile, the employed bee will be changed
into a scout. The scout randomly produces the new solution by (5) and then compares the fitness
of new solution with that of its old one. If the new solution is better than the old solution, it is
replaced with the old one and set its own itrail into 0. This scout will be changed into employed bee.
Otherwise, the old one is retained in the memory.

thresholds of MEABCT algorithm are equivalent or very close to optimal thresholds derived by the
exhaustive search methods. Furthermore, we find that the computation times of

exhaustive search method grows exponentially with the number of required thresholds. Obviously,
the computation needs for the exhaustive search are absolutely unacceptable for 4k (k: number of
thresholds). The computation times of the MEABCT algorithm is significantly faster compared to
the exhaustive search algorithm. The performance metrics for checking the effectiveness of the
method are chosen as the computation time so as to get an idea of complexity, and the PSNR which
is used to determine the quality of the thresholded images. Table 2 shows the selected thresholds,
computation time, PSNR value and the corresponding fitness value of five test images with
different thresholds. This table provides quantitative standard for evaluating. This table shows
that the number of thresholds increase, the PSNand the fitness value are enlarged.
The MEABCT and other three multilevel thresholding methods that are MEHBMOT, PSO and
HCOCLPSO algorithm are implemented for the purpose of comparisons. Table 3 shows the selected
thresholds of the three test images. It is interesting that the selected thresholds by the MEABCT
algorithm are equivalent (for 2- or 3-threshold problems) or very close (4- or 5-threshold problem)
to the ones MEHBMOT algorithm. The thresholds obtained by PSO algorithms in the segmentation
of BIRD image are also distinct from the one of the MEABCT algorithm in 5-level thresholding.
It is possible to reveal that the PSO algorithm is unsuitable to search for thresholds. Table 4 shows
corresponding PSNR values of the four different multilevel thresholding methods. Several aspects
are found in the two tables. The computation time of the MEABCT algorithm is between the
MEHBMOT and PSO in the segmentation of LENA, PEPPER and BIRD images. An aspect is
found that the HCOCLPSO algorithm is not acceptable because of the heavy need of computation
times. Finally, from the corresponding the fitness values of selected thresholds using MEABCT
algorithm it appears the fact that the selected thresholds of the MEABCT algorithm can effectively
find the adequate solutions based on the maximum entropy criterion.

1 Introduction
Thresholding is one of the most important techniques for performing image segmentation. It is
generally simple and computationally efficient. The main objective is to determine a threshold for
bi-level thresholding or several thresholds for multilevel thresholding for image segmentation.
Bi-level thresholding selects only one threshold which separates the pixels into two classes:
multilevel thresholding determines multiple thresholds which divide the pixels into several groups.
In general, the global thresholding methods can be classified as parametric and nonparametric.
These methods select thresholds by optimizing some criterion functions defined from images. In
algorithm that are the variation of light intensity and formulation of attractiveness. Yang [16]
simplifies the attractiveness of a firefly is determined by its brightness which in turn is associated
with the encoded objective function. The attractiveness is proportional to their brightness.
Furthermore, every member ix of the firefly swarm is characterized by its bright Ii which can be
directly expressed as an inverse of a cost function for a minimization problem. Lukasik and Zak [17]
applied the firefly algorithm for continuous constrained optimization. Yang [18] compared the
firefly algorithm with the other meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic and particle swarm
optimization algorithms in the multimodal optimization. These two works had the same
conclusions that the algorithm applied the proposed firefly algorithm is superior to the two existing
meta-heuristic algorithms.
This paper applies the firefly algorithm to search for the multilevel thresholds using the
maximum entropy (MET) criterion. This proposed method is called the maximum entropy based
firefly thresholding (MEFFT) algorithm. In the experiments presented in this paper, the exhaustive
search method is conducted to derive the optimal solutions for comparison with the results
generated from MEFFT algorithm. The three different methods, -- the PSO, the hybrid
cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm (HCOCLPSO) and the MEHBMOT --
are implemented in the several real images for purposes of comparison. The section 2 presents the
proposed MEFFT algorithm. Performance evaluation and experimental results are presented in
detail in Section 3. Finally, some conclusions are made in Section 4.
2. Maximum entropy firefly thresholding algorithm
The entropy criterion, proposed by Kapur et al [8], was widely used in determining the optimal
thresholding in image segmentation. The original algorithm had been developed for bi-level
thresholding. The method can also extend to solve multilevel thresholding problems and can be
described as follows.
Let there be L gray levels in a given image Iand these gray levels are in the range {0, 1, 2,…, L-1}.
Then one can define )10(,/)(  LiNihPi where
)(ih denotes the number of pixels with gray-level i.

For evaluating the performance of the proposed MEFFT algorithm, we have implemented this
method on the five test images. The performance metrics for checking the effectiveness of the
method are chosen as the computation time so as to get an idea of complexity, and the PSNR which
is used to determine the quality of the thresholded images. Table 2 shows the selected thresholds,
computation time, PSNR value and the corresponding fitness value of five test images with
different thresholds. This table provides quantitative standard for evaluating. This table shows
that the number of thresholds increase, the PSNR and the fitness value are enlarged.

aspect is found that the HCOCLPSO are not acceptable because of the large computation times.
Finally, from the corresponding the fitness values of selected thresholds using MEFFT algorithm it
appears the fact that the selected thresholds of the MEFFT algorithm can effectively find the
adequate solutions based on the maximum entropy criterion.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a method, called the MEFFT algorithm, for multilevel thresholds
selection using the maximum entropy criterion. The MEFFT algorithm simulates the behavior of
fireflies and the phenomenon of bioluminescent communication to develop the algorithm to select
the adequate thresholds for image segmentation. The segmentation results of MEFFT algorithm
are promising and it encourages further researches for applying this algorithm to complex and
real-time image analysis problems such as target recognition, complex document analysis and
biomedical image application.
