Leu [13] which discussing influence of the 
parameter on squaring circular tube simply 
with finite element method. The primary task 
of the preliminary discussion on the squaring 
process of circular tube was to analyze the 
deformation history of squared transverse of 
circular tube and load distribution. The 
non-linear problem comprised (1) 
geometrical non-linear behavior due to large 
displacement, large rotation and large strain; 
(2) the non-linear constitutive behavior of 
material with elasto-plastic deformation; (3) 
friction and changing situation of 
contact-separation due to contact interface. 
Due to large capacity of memory and 
processing speed of PC, finite element is 
suitable for solving such non-linear 
problems. 
This study conducted radially 
compressed press-forming to circular tube 
between two V-shape dies to make a square 
tube without collapse and fit-contacting the 
mold during the whole pressing process 
(Figure 1(c)). Collapse of tube surface may 
be due to geometric effect, property of the 
material and contact friction on symmetrical 
sections of the square tube. Since not much 
work has been carried out on squaring 
circular tube, the main aim of this study was 
to establish incremental elasto-plastic 
finite-element analysis formulation of 
Coulomb’s friction law and adopted 
minr method of Yamada et al. [14] to global 
stiffness matrix to solve the problems of 
contact friction, contact-separation of tube 
and die, limits of material element rotating 
increment allowance or strain increment 
allowance and elasto-plastic transient 
situation in order to meet the demand of 
calculation for linear increment and acquire 
correct and complete boundary contact 
situation. Such method could be used in 
simulating the deformation history of 
squaring process of circular tube, load 
distribution and discussion on the influence 
of process parameters.

The aforementioned problem is solved

replaced by incremental quantities, assuming 
that rates are maintained constant in each 
incremental step. Standard finite element

4. Res
the
 
ults and discussion 
A comparison of punch load of the 
experiments, using zinc stearate lubricant, 
with that in the FEM simulation by assuming 
 friction coefficient to be 0.05 is shown in 
Figure 3. It showed that the load of small 
tR  was larger than the load of large tR . If 
tR  was the same value, load of copper tube 
was larger than that of aluminum tube, which 
showed influence of the material. Good 
agreement between the experimental and 
calculated is obtained in this relationship.  
When compression proceeds in the 
squaring process, the contact points of load 
application move out around the tube, it 
would have the effect of shortening the arm 
which has produced high moments. In the 
meantime, the geometric constraints as a 
small edge radius produce in vertical and 
horizontal directions of diameter of tube, 
which will increase its degree with 
compression. If the material strain hardens in 
the plastic, the effect will still increase the 
load carrying capacity under severe 
compression. Generally, the tube may be 
flattened in the contact zone of V-shape 
punch without separation and a square tube 
would be successfully shaped. But in some 
process conditions, separation would be 
occurred upon increasing the separation.  
Squaring process of the two materials 
of circular tubes and the final shape of the 
square tube after the springback were 
simulated according to the material 
properties listed in Table 1 and the FE code 
to examine whether collapse would appear 
(Figure 4). Nodal displacement increment of 
tube is shown in Figure 5. All simulations of 
punch stroke were based on the condition of 
hypothesis of deformed edge of square tube 
was a quarter circle. During the process of 
squaring compression, the outer radius of 
edge being four times tube thickness was 
used to decide punch stroke in order to 
approximately simulate critical situation of 
squaring deformation and prevent pure 
bending. Figures 4 and 5 showed that the 
punch stoke U within the range of 0.5 mm to 
4.2 mm collapsed and deformed when 
geometrical ratios ( tR ) were different. 
Figure 4(a) showed that the squaring process 
with 67.11=tR  showed obvious collapse 
and deformation within 3.50 mm to 4.20 mm. 
Separation appeared at the middle between

developed to treat the non-linear problems 
of plasticity and boundary conditions in an 
incremental manner. The sliding-sticking 
friction mode is specially considered in the 
present work. Satisfacto
between the calculated and the experimental 
lues is obtained that clearly demonstrates 
e efficiency of the code.  
1. An extended minr  technique can trace 
adequately the entire deformation history 
of the squaring process. 
2. The simulated result of the relationship 
between punch load and punch travel 
agree well with the experimental results.
