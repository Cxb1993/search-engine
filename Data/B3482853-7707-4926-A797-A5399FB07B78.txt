21. Introduction
Unsteady initial states and ubiquitous
disturbances of unpredicted nature impose
practical difficulties on the identification of
linear parametric models from plant tests.
Identification under unknown disturbances has
not been fully resolved because of the lack of a
proper investigation into the practical problems
delineated below. First, the unknown disturbance
dynamics could be widely different from the
process dynamics. Second, the load disturbance
is likely to occur at an unknown time during a
plant test. Third, the disturbance affecting the
identification test can be either deterministic or
stochastic.
Many of the available identification methods
are restricted to predetermined test conditions
and a specific type of disturbance. Hang et al.
(1993), Shen et al. (1996), and Park et al. (1997)
proposed corrective or iterative procedures to
remove the biasing effect caused by a static load
disturbance on a relay test. Wang et al. (2006)
developed an identification method based on a
multiple integration approach and relay tests
under nonzero initial conditions and static load
disturbances. These methods may not be valid
for non-static load disturbances occurring during
the test.
As a remedy, Hwang and Wang (2003)
developed a time- and frequency-weighted
integral approach for identification from relay
tests under non-static load disturbances. The
properly chosen frequency weighting could
reject the low-frequency content of distinct load
dynamics. Liu and Gao (2008) presented an
identification method based on step-like tests. In
this method, a polynomial function in time is
employed to fit the transient behavior of the load
disturbance and a multiple integration is
exploited to derive a linear regression equation
for parameter estimation. However, these
methods can cope only with a partial class of
deterministic and stochastic disturbances.
The aforementioned identification methods
were proposed to find continuous-time models
or frequency-response data for single-
input/single-output (SISO) systems. The
corresponding algorithms cannot obtain good
discrete-time models provided the sample time is
varied widely as required by the data acquisition
system. On the other hand, Wahlberg (1991) has
shown that identification using discrete Laguerre
models is insensitive to the choice of the sample
time and possesses good asymptotic statistical
properties for least-squares estimation.
A partial objective of this project is to develop
a method that identifies discrete parametric
models using test data distorted by unknown
initial states and disturbances for linear multiple-
input/multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A
Laguerre ARX (autoregressive with exogenous
input) model structure of augmented order in
conjunction with an adjustable time-scaling
factor is generalized to derive a linear regression
equation that incorporates the terms concerning
initial states and disturbances entering any time
during the identification test. The least-squares
estimator of the Laguerre coefficients could
result in accurate process and disturbance
models.
2. Discrete Laguerre Expansion
Assume that the discrete transfer function G(z)
is strictly proper (G(∞)＝0), analytic in z 1,
and continuous in z 1. For 1, there exists
a sequence { }ig such that

(1b)
where  is a time-scaling factor, ig is the
Laguerre coefficients, and T is the sample time.
Equations (1a) and (1b) constitute the discrete
Laguerre Expansion (Wahlberg, 1991). The
orthogonal functions given in Eq. (1b) are the
Laguerre functions with single poles in . It has
been revealed that with a good choice of , Eq.
(1a) can be approximated well by the partial sum
of r terms:

We denote Eq. (2) as a Laguerre FIR (finite
impulse response) model. For a fast rate of
4polynomials of degrees Pn 1, Pn 1, P L1,n n
and P L2 ,n n respectively, and P ( ),A z L1( ),A z
and L2 ( )A z are monic polynomials of degrees Pn ,
L1n , and L2n , respectively.
Equation (8) reveals that each load disturbance
is composed from dynamics similar to and those
distinct from the process dynamics P ( ).A z
Without loss of generality, we assume that
L1( )B z and L2 ( )B z are coprime with L1( )A z and
L2 ( ),A z respectively, and P ( )A z is coprime with
P ( ),B z L1( ),A z L2 ( ).A z As a result, L1( )A z and
L2 ( )A z denote the distinct dynamics of load
disturbances and their least common multiple
forms a monic polynomial L ( )A z of degree nL.
Using partial fraction expansions and letting
P L( ) ( ) ( )A z A z A z and P L( ) ( ) ( ),B z B z A z
we can rearrange Eq. (8) as follows:

It follows that the method utilizes an
augmented number of parameters to cope with
the situations of unknown initial states and load
disturbances. The deficiency caused by the least-
squares estimation with an increased number of
parameters is circumvented by the Laguerre
expansion that involves operators with larger
memory. Nevertheless, when certain prior
information is available, the number of
parameters to be estimated can be reduced
substantially. For example, n can be reduced to
the process order nP, or idcan be eliminated
from Eq. (13) if the load disturbances contain no
distinct dynamics or the assumption of the
second load disturbance is not required.
3.2 MIMO process identification
The preceding algorithm for the SISO case
can be readily extended to the MIMO case. For a
wm (w outputs, m inputs) process, the l-th
6prime purpose of the l setting for the l-th
MISO subsystem is to ensure the accuracy of the
estimated process models, (a )P,ˆ ( )ljG z or
( t )
P,ˆ ( ).ljG z In
the meantime, L,l and/or lj can be accurately
determined.
For this purpose, the outputs predicted by the
augmented models, (a )ˆ ( ),ly k are calculated via
the inverse z-transform of Eq. (16) with all
parameters replaced by their corresponding
estimates as follows:
(a ) (a )
P, IL,
ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) ( ) ( )l l lY z Y z Y z  (19)
In this expression, the process-only outputs
predicted by the Laguerre ARX models, (a)P,ˆ ( ),ly k
can be calculated from Eq. (17) as follows:

The estimated effects of initial states and load
disturbances, IL,ˆ ( )ly k or IL,ˆ ( ),lY z are derivable
from Eq. (16). We then develop two error criteria
to find the best values of l , L,l , and lj. The
first is the output error criterion:

where (a ) ( )lOE k denotes the output error at

criterion, which compares the process-only
outputs predicted by the Laguerre ARX models
of true order, ( t )P ,ˆ ( ),ly k with those predicted by
the Laguerre FIR models, FIR ,ˆ ( ),ly k as follows:

In the evaluation of FIR ,ˆ ( ),ly k we first exclude
the effects of initial states and load disturbances
from the observed outputs as follows:
FIR , IL ,ˆ( ) ( ) ( )l l ly k y k y k  (23)
The Laguerre FIR model defined in Eq. (2) for
the SISO case is then extended to the MISO case

Applying the least-squares method to Eqs. (23)
and (24) gives the estimates .ˆljig The model
predicted outputs FIR ,ˆ ( )ly k are calculated
according to Eq. (24) with ljig being replaced by
.ˆljig
While dealing with distinct load dynamics, l
must be selected so that T/(1−l) is close to the
dominating time constants of the process to be
identified. Otherwise, the effects of load
disturbances would be amplified especially when
the assumed augmented order ln is not
sufficiently large to account for such dynamics.
Unfortunately, the best l value cannot be
revealed by the output error criterion alone
because the Laguerre ARX models are not
sensitive to l and hence it is likely to have a
small OEJ with both the process and disturbance
models being inaccurately estimated. On the
other hand, the goodness of the relative error
criterion RE ,J involving the Laguerre FIR
models, relies largely on the proper selection of
l . It is then postulated that the best l can
appear only if both the Laguerre ARX and FIR
models predict resembling outputs, as revealed
by the minimum of REJ . A relatively small ljr in
Eq. (24) could enhance the sensitivity of REJ
against l ; a good choice is to assign
P, 2lj ljr n  .
We propose a procedure based on the two
criteria to find the best l setting, while
allowing L,l and lj to be accurately
determined. First, set the search range for l ,
8different realizations of e(k). The mean and
standard deviation of each parameter estimate of
the process model were calculated from 100
simulation runs.

The load disturbance in each case was
composed from a disturbance without distinct
dynamics and a disturbance with distinct
dynamics. The latter entered the system at
L 0 and L 50 for Cases A and B,
respectively. Assuming the augmented orders n =
4, 3, and 2, the proposed method based on Eqs.
(13), (20), and (21) is applied to identify the
process models and delays, ( t )P ( )G z and , as
enumerated in Table 1. Figure 1 delineates that
the output measurements, y(k), and the effects of
initial states and load disturbances, IL ( ),y k
compared against their model predictions,
delivered by Eqs. (16) and (19) with n = 3.
It must be pointed out that the true values of
process order nP, process delay, and load delay
L are often unknown a priori. To overcome
these difficulties, our method yields the optimal
estimation of the process model by allowing,,
and L to be secured according to the proposed
search procedure with a presumed value of n.
Table 1 reveals that regardless of the occurring
time of a load disturbance with distinct dynamics,
good process models are obtainable as long as n
is set greater than the actual process order nP at
least by one. Evidently, both settings of n = 4
and n = 3 lead to comparably good estimates of
the process model, exact estimates of and
rather small values of OEJ . A plausible reason is
that when the assumed n is greater than nP but
smaller than the true value, the load delay L
could be adjusted to account for the unmodeled
load dynamics so as to enhance the estimation
accuracy. On the contrary, as n is set to 2 (equal
to nP), the identification results become rather
poor as indicated by large values of OEJ . It
appears that the sole use of L with no extra
time-lag element is unable to describe the
behavior of distinct load dynamics. This abrupt
change in OEJ clearly infers that the actual nP is
two.
As a further illustration of the effect of n using
Case B, Figure 2 compares the actual second
load disturbance to the estimated ones obtained
by Eq. (11) with L adjustable. It can be seen
that both the estimated load models of n = 4 and
3 approximate well the second load disturbance,
whereas the estimated load model of n = 2 fails
to describe the load behavior, causing poor
estimation of the process model.

static nonlinearity cannot be described well by the 
assumed function, or the measured output is corrupted by 
severe noise. 
 
In this work, a non-iterative method is presented to 
identify a continuous-time Wiener model. The algorithm 
involves describing the linear dynamics by a Laguerre 
FIR (finite impulse response) expansion and 
approximating the static nonlinearity by an inverse 
polynomial function. An error criterion is then developed 
to find the time-scaling factor  and the output reference 
value 0y . The former is crucial to the estimation accuracy 
of the linear dynamic part, whereas the latter can be 
adjusted to provide a better approximation for the 
nonlinear static part. The identified Wiener model can be 
easily employed to design a nonlinear controller. 
 
 
2. Continuous Laguerre Expansion 
 
Assume that the transfer function G(s) is strictly proper 
(G(∞)  0), analytic in Re(s)  0, and continuous in 
Re(s)  0. For   0, there exists a sequence { }ig  such 
that

where  is the time-scaling factor and ig  denotes the 
Laguerre coefficients. Equations (1a) and (1b) constitute 
the continuous Laguerre expansion [11]. Equation (1b) is 
obtained from the Laplace transform of the classical 
orthogonal Laguerre functions with single poles. With a 
good choice of , Eq. (1a) can be approximated well by 
the partial sum of r terms:

We denote Eq. (2) as a Laguerre FIR (finite impulse 
response) model. For a fast rate of convergence, 1/ 
should be set close to the dominating time constants of the 
process [11, 12]. 
 
An alternative is to represent G(s) by a Laguerre ARX 
(autoregressive with exogenous input) model as follows:

general, G(s) can also be expressed by the conventional 
transfer function model as

3. Non-Iterative Identification of Wiener 
Processes via Laguerre FIR Models 
 
Here, we consider the identification of a continuous-time 
Wiener process as depicted in Figure 1. The input and 
output variables, u(t) and y(t), are measurable. However, 
the internal signal x(t) between the linear dynamic and the 
nonlinear static block is inaccessible to measurements. 
Note that each of the three variable is the deviation 
variable, defined as the actual variable minus its original 
steady-state value. 
 
The linear dynamic part of the Wiener process can be 
described by the Laguerre FIR model as

In the above formulae, ˆ ig , ˆ jc , and 0xˆ  are the estimated

It is postulated that if the least-squares parameter 
estimator is accurate, the two estimates calculated by Eqs. 
(15) and (16) must be identical or at least close to each 
other. We thus seek  and 0y  such that the following error 
criterion is minimized:

where ˆ (0)G  denotes the steady-state gain of the estimated 
linear dynamic part. Note that the estimates of the internal 
variable must be scaled by the steady-state gain to ensure 
that the error for each set of  and 0y  is calculated on a 
fair basis. 
 
 
5. Identification and Control of a Simulated 
Example 
 
A simulated physical example has been employed to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-
iterative identification and nonlinear control method. Test 
data for identification were generated by a zero-mean 
white random input signal, which was stepwise 
continuous and limited to different feasible ranges. To 
simulate noisy situations, measurement noise was added 
to corrupt the output data of each test run. 
 
This example is a pH neutralization process employed by 
Nahas et al. [13]. Acid, buffer, and base streams are mixed 
in a tank and the effluent pH is measured. The process 
involves three nonlinear ordinary differential equations 
and a nonlinear algebraic equation for the pH:

To identify this buffering pH process at the original steady 
state of ( 3q , pH ) = (15.6 mL/s, 7.026), a white random 
input of the base flow q3  with a switching time of 25 
seconds was employed and the pH was measured as 
depicted in Figure 2. The input q3  was limited to three 
operating ranges: 
Range A: q3 = 13 ~ 50 mL/s 
Range B: q3 = 0 ~ 15.6 mL/s 
Range C: q3 = 0 ~ 50 mL/s

Using the estimated  linxˆ t  as output and applying Eq. (3) 
with n = 1 could yield a Laguerre ARX model and then 
lead to the conventional transfer function model 
1 1
ˆˆ ˆ( ) ( )G s b s a   as defined in Eq. (4). The results are 
shown below: 
ˆ ( ) 0.0943 (95.7 1)G s s   for range A 
ˆ ( ) 0.121 (74.7 1)G s s     for range B 
ˆ ( ) 0.340 (79.6 1)G s s     for range C 
 
The goodness of the estimated nonlinear static part is 
evaluated by fitting it to the actual static titration curve as 
depicted in Figure 3. The estimated titration curves for the 
three operating ranges are recovered by plotting 
( ) pHy t   versus  nl 1 1 3ˆˆ ˆx t a b q  according to Eq. (16). 
To verify the benefit of adjusting the reference point, the 
static results given by the optimal reference point are 
compared to those given by the zero reference point. It 
follows that the use of the optimal reference point results 
in a perfect fit to the actual titration curve for every 
operating range, whereas the use of the zero reference 
point is quite poor for ranges A and B. Note that the 
original steady state lies near the margin of these ranges. 
Note also that the estimates of the process time constant 
approximate closely the theoretical value of 
1 2 3( ) 88.5Ah q q q    seconds. Such an agreement 
justifies that the pH process is indeed of Wiener type. 
 
For model validation, we apply arbitrary input signals that 
cover the specified operating ranges. Figure 4 compares 
the actual output responses against those predicted by the 
identified Wiener models as well as the linear models. It 
appears that for all operating ranges, the Wiener models 
describe the nonlinear process reasonably well and are far 
superior to the linear ones. 
 
The proposed identification method yields an inverse 
polynomial function for static nonlinearity, which can be 
directly applied to calculate the internal variable x(t) from 
the measured output y(t). Incorporating this inverse 
function in the feedback path of the PI control system 
would cause a linear system between u(t) and x(t). 
Consequently, the linear IMC algorithm can be used to 
design a PI controller. For each operating range, Figure 5 
compares the output response of the PI control system 
based on the Wiener model to that based on the linear 
model. Obviously, the nonlinear controller designs based 
on the Wiener models outperform the linear designs. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
It has been demonstrated that the proposed method could 
identify a Wiener model in a non-iterative manner. It is 
effective for a wide range of test conditions and process 
nonlinearities. The method approximates the static 
nonlinearity by an inverse polynomial function with the 
adjustable reference point. This allows an arbitrary design 
of test conditions and facilitates the estimation accuracy
