NF for a higher membrane flux rate and significantly better permeate water quality.  
Many researchers have shown that NF membrane technology provides very high 
removal of natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water treatment [12].  Owen et al. 
[13] proposed that NF with a relatively lower MWCO of 400-800 Da is effective in 
controlling the formations of DBPs.  Retentions of various micropollutants by NF 5 
membranes were reported by several researchers [14-16]. 
NF now is competitive with other NOM removal technologies such as conventional 
clarification and GAC adsorption because of the following advantages: simplicity of 
operation, development of higher flux membrane with low fouling potentials, and lower 
membrane costs [17].  Some researchers have indicated that membrane costs are 10 
comparable to or lower than conventional treatment for small systems of < 20,000 m3/d, 
or 5 mgd [17-18].  However, there are still a lot of unknowns in the removal 
mechanisms by NF membranes.  The rejections of solutes by NF membrane are rather 
complicated.  Membrane properties such as hydrophobicity, membrane charge, 
membrane pore size, tendency to fouling, resistance to temperature, retention properties 15 
and permeability dramatically affect the filtration process.  Solute properties such as 
dipole moment and hydrophibicity also affect the separation efficiency by adsorbing or 
interacting with membrane surfaces [19-20]. 
Two main solute retention properties that include size (sieving or steric interaction) 
effect and charge (Donnan) effect commonly are recognized at the present time.  Size 20 
exclusion is the main separation mechanism for uncharged solutes based on the 
relationship between the membrane pore size and permeating molecule size, while 
charge exclusion is caused by electrostatic interactions between the charged permeating

2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Membranes and model compounds 
In this study, two types of commercial thin-film polyamide NF membranes, NF70 and 
NF270, produced by Dow-FilmTec were examined.  Table 1 summarizes the 
characteristics of NF70 and NF270 membranes.  Membranes of NF70 and NF270 with 5 
surface areas of 46.2cm2 were used throughout this research. 
Four model compounds with different functional groups of benzene i.e., carboxylic and 
phenolic groups, were used.  Phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihroxybenzene), resorcinol 
(1,3-dihydroxybenzene) and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid were chosen as small THMPs, 
while tannic acid was chosen as the medium molar mass compound.  All model 10 
compounds were purchased from Riedel-de Haën.  Table 2 shows the properties of the 
model compounds and Fig. 1 shows the structure of the model compounds.  All stock 
solutions were prepared using organic-free and de-ionized water (Milli-Q SP).  The 
DOC (dissolved organic matter) concentrations for the model compounds were prepared 
at 2.0, 5.0 and 8.0 mg/L.  The pHs of the feed solutions were adjusted in the range 15 
between 3 and 10 with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. 
 
2.2 PEG and saccharide analysis 
The MWCO of NF70 was estimated at 250Da in our previous research [27]. 
Polyethylene glycol mixtures (PEG, Aldrich) with different molecular weights (200, 300, 20 
400, 600 and 1500 Da) were used to estimate the MWCO of the NF270 membrane.

rejection [28].

where Cp is the concentration of permeate and Cf is the average concentration of feed 5

2.4 Streaming potential measurements 
The streaming potential (∆E) was measured to determine the zeta potential (ζ) on the 
membrane surface, which can be used to represent the membrane surface charge.  The 10 
experimental set-up was almost identical to [29].  The dimensions of the membrane 
samples are 76×26 mm.  A 0.001 KCl solution and a pair of platina electrodes were 
used to measure the streaming potential, and the pH was adjusted by adding NaOH and 
HCl to the solution. 
The relationship between ∆E and ζ is given by the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation 15 
with the Fairbrother and Mastin approach [30]:

According to [22], the pore size of the membrane can be evaluated using the Speigler 
and Kedem membrane transport model (eq. (3) and (4)) [21] and the SHP model (eq. (5)) 
with the retention rates of uncharged saccharides.

where rs is the Stokes radius of the compound (nm), and rp is the membrane pore radius 10 
(nm). 
Table 4 shows the molecular weights, molecular width, molecular length, diffusivities 
and solute radii of the selected saccharides used in the retention experiments.  Table 5 
is the estimated pore radii of NF70 and NF270 membranes calculated for each 
saccharide solute.  The average pore radius of the NF70 membrane is calculated at 15 
0.48 nm, and the average pore radius of the NF270 membrane is calculated at 0.54 nm.  
Comparable results of estimating the average pore radii for NF70 and NF270 
membranes were reported by other researchers [32-34].  These results suggest that the 
 12 
tests, three small THMPs remain NPF over 90% in the filtration period, except for the 
tannic acid with NPF less than 90% in 5 hours. 
DOC in the permeate increased slightly for resorcinol and phloroglucinol as time 
progressed. Rejections of 79.1% and 80.6% were observed for resorcinol and 
phloroglucinol, respectively, at the end of the NF70 filtration experiments.  Rejections 5 
of 72.5% and 74.3% were observed for resorcinol and phloroglucinol, respectively, at 
the end of the NF270 filtration experiments (Fig. 4-5).  This rejection is likely due to 
the adsorption of model compounds by hydrogen bonding between the phenoic 
functional groups on nonionic solutes and carbonyl functional groups on polyaimde NF 
membranes [15, 35].  The permeate concentration presents a characteristic 10 
breakthrough curve with a small breakthrough concentration, which means that when 
adsorption reaches equilibrium and size exclusion becomes a dominant rejection 
mechanism [15].  3-hydrobenzoic acid has a higher compound rejection (about 86.2% 
for NF70 and 80.0% for NF270 membranes) compared to phloroglucinol and resorcinol, 
and the DOC in permeate flux remains fairly constant during the filtration period (Fig. 15 
6).  This rejection is due to the hydrolysis of the carboxyl group on 3-hydrobenzoic 
acid (pK1=4.06, Table 2) at pH 7.  Although the MW of 3-hydrobenzoic acid is very 
similar to that of resorcinol and phloroglucinol, this compound carries a negative charge 
at neutral pH and can be excluded by the NF70 and NF270 membranes (with negative 
charge at neutral pH) owing to the electrostatic repulsive interaction with the membrane 20 
surfaces [36].  It can be conclude that the influence of charge exclusion on compound 
rejection is greater than the influence of compound adsorption on compound rejection at 
neutral pH. 
 14 
 
3.3 Effect of pH on compound rejections 
The Stokes radius of each model compound is shown in Table 2.  The information 
contained in Table 2 was calculated using the Wilke and Chang and the Stokes-Einstein 
equations [37].  The Stokes radii of three small THMPs are smaller than the average 5 
pore radii of the NF70 and NF270 membranes, and the Stokes radius of tannic acid is 
significantly larger than the average pore size of both membranes.  Thus, it is expected 
that the retention of the small THMPs would be very low and the retention would be 
complete for tannic acid if the rejection mechanism was only based on the steric 
hindrance.  From the experimental data in Fig. 4-8, it indicates that the rejections of 10 
three small THMPs are high (72.5% to 86.2%), which implies that there may be other 
rejection mechanisms, such as charge effect, affecting the removal efficiency of the NF 
membrane filtration process. 
To evaluate the effect of charge exclusion, i.e., similar charges processed by the 
membrane surface of the compound functional groups, feed solutions of model 15 
compounds with different pH values were applied on both NF membranes.  Figure 9 
shows the relationship between the solution pHs and model compounds rejections.  All 
data shows that rejection of all four model compounds increases with an increase in pH 
for both NF membrane.  A more profound pH effect was observed for the NF270 
membrane.  This pH effect is due to the polyelectrolyte character of the model 20 
compounds and the negatively charged NF membrane characteristics, which is 
discussed below. 
 16 
by both the “sieve effect” and the “charge effect” on the NF membranes.  As a result, 
the removal efficiency of tannic acid increases from 93.6% up to 98.5% filtered by the 
NF70 membrane and from 87.6% to 99.9% filtered by the NF270 membrane. 
There is a notable trend in the experimental data of NF270 membrane that the rejections 
of all model compounds show strong correlation with the pH values (Fig. 9), which 5 
implies that the electrostatic interaction between the NF270 membrane surface and the 
model compounds grows stronger as the solution pH rises.  To confirm the electrostatic 
interactions between membrane surface and model compounds, the zeta potentials of 
NF70 and NF270 membranes at different pH values were measured.  Figure 10 shows 
the zeta potential values versus the pH values for the NF70 and NF270 membranes.  10 
Both membranes show negative zeta potential values at neutral pH.  The shape of the 
zeta potential curves indicates amphoteric surfaces; the higher pH values, the higher 
zeta potentials values.  Ionizable carboxyl and amine functional groups provide the 
amphoteric surfaces resulting from the interfacial polymerization reaction for membrane 
synthesis with monomeric polyamide and polyfunctional acyl halide [30].  The 15 
isoelectric point (point-of-zero charge) of each NF membrane is near pH 4, which 
confirms the results of Nghiem et al. [15] and Childress and Elimelech [30]. 
Since the membranes are more negatively charged as pH values are higher above the 
isoelecric point, the electrostatic repulsion force between the membrane surface and the 
model compounds increases as pH rises, and the model compounds rejections should 20 
increase as pH rises.  Dissociation of the functional groups on the membrane and the 
model compounds intensifies the electrostatic interaction between the NF70 and/or 
NF270 membranes and model compounds so that the rejection performance increases.  
 18 
implies that the solution pH would greatly affect the performance of the NF270 
membrane.  The application of NF270 at different pH values should be evaluated, and 
the optimum filtration performance should be determined.  The NF270 membrane 
exhibits high permeation rate values, which decreases energy consumption and energy 
costs.  This study affirms the use of the NF270 membrane in the drinking water 5 
purification process.
