Impact of Human Activities to Hydrologic Alterations on River Regime: Tanshui 
River Watershed as an example 
Introduction 
The extreme hydrologic event, as the region water shortage, happens more frequently 
due to the climate change. Facing the possible droughts, large scale water diversion is 
always desired. The water diversion operation highly changes the original ecological 
flow region and causes significant impact to downstream ecosystem. For sustainable 
development, to find the balance between appropriate ecological conditions and water 
supply security of human sociality is an essential issue. However, most relationship is 
implicit and not able to be predicted directly. Therefore, understanding the impact to 
ecosystem due to human interference and hydrologic change is essential for 
developing a better operating policy of water diversion. 
A new object of operational policy of water resources infrastructure is to reproduce 
the natural flow regime for the ecosystem (Poff et al., 1997; Cardwell et al., 1996; 
Ripo et al., 2003; Hughes and Ziervogel, 1998; Koel and Sparks, 2002; Richter et al., 
1998; Shiau and Wu, 2004; Suen and Eheart, 2006). In order to describe the flow 
regime, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA), that developed by the Nature 
Conservancy in the 1990s, is most widely used. IHA can quickly process daily 
hydrologic records to enable characterization of natural water conditions and facilitate 
evaluations of human-induced changes to flow regimes (Mathews & Richter, 2007). 
IHA approach includes 32 hydrologic parameters that characterize the inter-annual 
variability in water conditions. According to the IHA’s parameters, Range of 
Variability Approach (RVA) is designed to investigate the change of natural 
hydrologic variability. 
IHA and RVA could successfully access the change of the ecological hydrology of 
natural flow conditions while the event or behavior of human interference has been 
identified. However, the human activities continue to happen one by one and keep 
progressing. Most IHA studies explore the impacts caused by hydraulic structures and 
facilities construction. Few studies have worked on identifying the potential human 
interference. Lian et al. (2010) presents the statistical analyses the hydrological 
change points caused by human activities and to quantify hydrological alterations in 
the Illinois River. According to observed data, they used the Pettitt-Mann-Whitney 
change-point statistics analysis to identify two change point years, 1938 and 1972. 
The change in 1938 change was due primarily to the reduction of diversion flow from 
Lake Michigan and the change in 1972 was due to the change of hydrologic 
conditions. 
change points of different IHA parameters as nonparametric statistical property. 
Let n be the length of the time series and t be the time of the most likely change point. 
A time series of n years of flow or stage can be divided by the time t into two sample 
groups,  and . Define the test statistic index, Ut, 
as: 
    for t = 2, …, T,     (1) 
where   ,  for , 
 for ,  for .  
Pettitt(1979) developed the following procedure to determine whether the 
change point was statistically significant. First, the test statistic Kt and the probability 
that a change point associated with maximal Ut can be approximated by, 
              (2) 
    (3) 
Equations (1)-(3) yield the change point with an estimated probability of P. If 
P is less than 0.05, the change point is statistically significant.  
Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations 
The Indicators of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) is a statistical package that 
computes a variety of parameters or indices from historic flow or stage records. It was 
developed by Richter et al (1996, 1997) and supported by The Nature Conservancy 
(TNC). It assesses the degree of hydrological alteration attributable to human induced 
changes within an ecosystem. IHA uses about 32 indicators for hydrological alteration 
so it can represent a wide-ranging of hydrologic regimes. These indicators includes 
five groups of characteristics that have significant relevance to ecological conditions 
and these characteristics are respectively related to: 1) magnitude of monthly water 
condition, 2) magnitude and duration of annual extreme condition, 3) timing of annual 
extreme conditions, 4) frequency and duration of high and low pluses, and 5) rate and 
frequency of change in conditions. Richter et al. (1997) introduced a method named 
the “Range of Variability Approach” to quantify the degree of alternation for each 
hydrologic parameter in IHA. The measure of hydrologic alteration, expressed as a 
percentage, can be calculated as: 
hydrologic alteration and human interference. By reviewing the locations of gage 
stations, it shows that change during the period from 1959 to 1964 mainly happens in 
the Dahan River. For other branches, this study does not find clear influence before 
and after 1959. Major hydrological alterations in this period are limited in the Dahan 
River. The flow stations in Dahan River corresponding to the alterations in this period 
are located in the near downstream and upstream of the Shihmen Reservoir. Yufeng, 
Sanguang, Xiayun, Lahao are in the upstream and Shihmen(1), Shihmen(3), Daping, 
Wutujue, Yuanshan (3) in the downstream. During the period from 1959 to 1964, the 
most significant and obvious human interference in Dahan River coud be the 
construction and operation of Shihmen Reservoir. Shihmen Reservoir is located 
midstream of the Dahan River, its water comes from north of the Tapachien Mountain 
in northern Taiwan. The government started the construction of started Shihmen 
Reservoir in 1953 and ends in 1964. The reservoir was first opened to the public in 
1964.  
Besides Shihmen Reservoir, the other construction of water supply facilities during 
this period includes Wulai hydraulic power-station, Liutu Water Treatment Plant, 
Shihmen irrigated system, and 34 water intake wells with total capacity to 96,000 cmd 
by Taiwan Water Corporation. Among these facilities, Wulai hydraulic power-station 
is located in the upstream of the Hsindian River and Liutu Water Treatment Plant is 
located in the Keelung River. From the flow data, this study cannot clearly identify 
the influence of them. The impact of Wulai hydraulic power-station and Liutu Water 
Treatment Plant to the Tanshui River flow regime may not be significant from the 
understanding of the result. 
From 1976 to 1983, the hydrologic alterations could also be found among all three 
branches. The stations with change point within this period include: Siouluan, Yufeng, 
Lengjiao, Gaoyi, Xiayun, Sanyin Bridge on the Dahan River, Sansia (2), Hengsi on 
the Sansia River, Jingmei on the Jingmei River, Quchi, Xiulang on the Hsindian River 
and Wudu on the Keelung River. The Jingmei River and the Sansia River are the 
branches of the Dahan River on the downstream section. For these stations on the 
Dahan River, they mostly are located on the upstream region of Shihmen Reservoir, 
except Sanyin Bridge. The influence on IHA parameter group is mainly on the 
monthly flow magnitude. As the reason, the interference of the hydrologic alteration 
could be the land use and land cover change due to inappropriate watershed 
development. On the other hand, it also could be the construction of Barlin Dam and 
Junghua Dam. The study has not yet distinguished which one dominates this 
alteration. Similarly to Dahan River, the alteration of Jingmei River and the Sansia 
River cannot relate to specific infrastructure development. The reason of the 
hydrologic alteration could be the urbanization in this downstream region. However, 
The analysis will include not only stage data but other data like land use change and 
climate parameters. Further study of these issues would help to obtain a better 
understanding of complex the human-ecosystem. This could improve current river 
management by avoiding significant adverse impact and create a more environmental 
friendly human-ecosystem.
