proposed in the literature (see [2], [4-6], [8], 
[10], [17], [22-23], [27-28]). Among those, 
the most popular and strongly suggested 
method is the one using desirability 
function to optimize the static multiple 
quality characteristics problems [1]. The 
desirability function proposed by Derringer 
and Suich [5] converts the multiple quality 
characteristics into a single characteristic 
problem by maximizing the total desirability. 
In general, each predicted response is 
transformed into a desirability value d for 
the desirability function model. If the 
predicted response exceeds the acceptable 
value, the desirability value d becomes 0; 
whereas if the predicted response is at the 
target value, the desirability value d 
becomes 1. In the Derringer and Suich 
formulation, the unacceptable values cannot 
be properly chosen for some practical 
situations. Therefore, Wu and Hamada [26] 
suggest the double-exponential desirability 
function to avoid improper situations. 
    Several researchers have studied the 
robust design of dynamic quality 
characteristics (see [3], [7], [9], [11-15], 
[18], [20-21], [24-25], [29-30]). However, 
few studies have been concerned with 
optimizing the robust design for nonlinear 
multiple dynamic quality characteristics. 
    In this paper, an optimal approach for 
correlated nonlinear multiple dynamic 
quality characteristics problems based on 
the double-exponential desirability function 
has been proposed. 
 
2. DYNAMIC PROBLEM 
 
    In the actual production activities, the 
produced products often have different 
target values, which are affected by 
different input of signal factor. That is, the 
required quality of the product is a dynamic 
function. The optimization involves 
determining the best control factor levels so 
that the desired output is at the ideal target 
value of a function of a signal factor setting 
in the dynamic problem. 
    Suppose that 1 2, ,..., nm m m  are the 
target values affected by the signal values 
1 2, , , nM M M"  and 1 2, , , ny y y…  are the 
characteristic values of the product. 
Dynamic problems are those in which we 
want the system’s response to follow the 
levels of the signal factor in a prescribed 
manner. The relationship between target 
value, im , and signal factor, iM , is shown 
in Figure 1.

characteristic, y, in the dynamic problem 
 
    Since the ideal function is i iy m= , we 
can treat a single dynamic problem as n 
static nominal-the best type problem. 
 
3. DESIRABILITY FUNCTION 
 
    The class of desirability functions 
defined by Derringer and Suich [5]. This 
method provides a trade-off among several 
quality characteristics to transform each 
predicted characteristic y  to a desirability 
value d, where 0 1d≤ ≤ . 
    For the nominal-the-best (NTB) type, 
it is reasonable to assume that the product is 
most desirable at y=m. Thus a lower value L 
and an upper value U should be chosen such 
that the product is considered unacceptable 
if y < L or y > U. Hence, the desirability 
function is defined as

     Phadke [16] described a problem 
involving the optimization of a temperature 
control circuit as shown in Figure 2. For a 
special target temperature, the circuit must 
turn a heater ON or OFF to control the heat 
input. The thermistor resistance, RT, 
decreases upon increasing the temperature. 
When the temperature rises above a certain 
value, the resistance RT drops below a 
threshold value (denoted as RT-OFF) so that 
the difference in the voltages between 
terminals 1 and 2 of the amplifier becomes 
sufficiently large and negative. The relay is 
then actuated to turn OFF the heater. 
Similarly, when the temperature falls below 
a certain value, the resistance RT rises above 
the threshold value (denoted as RT-ON) so 
that the difference in voltages between 
terminals 1 and 2 of the amplifier becomes 
sufficiently large and positive. The relay is 
then actuated to turn ON the heater.

    Therefore, the threshold resistance, 
RT-ON, at which the heater is turned ON and 
the threshold resistance, RT-OFF, at which the 
heater is turned OFF were selected as the 
quality characteristics. The mathematical 
functions for RT-ON and RT-OFF can be 
expressed as

    It is clearly a doubly dynamic problem. 
Referring to the circuit diagram of Figure 2, 
the four resistances, R1, R2, R3 and RT, form 
a Wheatstone bridge. Hence, any one of the 
three resistances, R1, R2 or R3, can be used 
to adjust the value of RT at which the bridge 
balances. 
    Any one of the three resistances, R1, R2 
or R3, can be used to adjust the value of RT 
at which the bridge balances. If R2 is chosen 
to be the signal factor for deciding the 
temperature setting, then it becomes a 
nonlinear dynamic problem. 
    In the temperature control circuit, there 
are four control factors (R1, R3, R4 and Ez) 
and one signal factor (R2); each control 
factor has 3 alternate levels listed in Table 1. 
The level 2 is the starting level of the 
control factors, and level 3 is 1.5 times the 
starting level and level 1 is 1/1.5=0.667 
times the starting level for the three 
resistances (R1, R2 and R4), and level 3 is 
1.2 times level 2, and level 1 is 0.8 times 
level 2 for the nominal voltage of Ez.

    There are five noise factors (R1, R3, R4, 
E0 and Ez); each noise factor has 3 alternate 
levels. The level 2 is the mean value, and 
levels 1 and 3 are displaced form level 2 on 
either side by 3 / 2σ , where σ  is 
one-third the tolerance. That is, the levels of 
noise factors are 
( 3 / 2 ,  ,  3 / 2 )μ σ μ μ σ+ − . The nominal 
values of the circuit parameters under the 
starting conditions, their tolerance (3 σ  
limits), and the three levels of testing are

    The ideal target values of RT-ON and 
RT-OFF that are affected by the levels of 
signal factor R2 are listed in Table 5. 
    If the shape constants are chosen as 
1 2 2α α= =  and scale constants are chosen 
as 1 2 1.5c c= = , and c12=0.25, then the 
desirability values, correlated desirability 
values and total desirability values of RT-ON 
and RT-OFF are obtained by equations (7)-(10) 
for each experimental combination. The 
data are tabulated in Table 6 and the main 
effects of factors based on TD are listed in 
Table 7. 
    From Table 8, the obtained optimal 
parameter conditions are A3B1C3D3 (R1=6.0 
kΩ, R3=0.667 kΩ, R4=60.0 kΩ and Ez=7.2 
V) by choosing the maximum total 
desirability TD.

3. DESIRABILITY FUNCTION 
 
    The class of desirability functions defined by 
Derringer and Suich [5]. This method provides a 
trade-off among several quality characteristics to 
transform each predicted characteristic y  to a 
desirability value d, where 0 1d≤ ≤ . 
    For the nominal-the-best (NTB) type, it is 
reasonable to assume that the product is most 
desirable at y=m. Thus a lower value L and an upper 
value U should be chosen such that the product is 
considered unacceptable if y < L or y > U. Hence, the 
desirability function is defined as

. (1) 
where m is the target value of the NTB type 
characteristic, and 1α  and 2α  are the shape 
constants of the desirability function. 
 
    Since L and U values in the Derring-Suich 
formulation cannot be properly chosen in some 
practical situations, Wu and Hamada recommended 
using the double-exponential function as the 
desirability function. The double-exponential 
desirability functions for NTB type are defined as

    In practical applications, the L, U and a

(USL) and 0, respectively.

6. CONCLUSION 
  
   Robust design has been gaining wide attention, 
and its applications have been extended to making 
reliable decisions when designing complex 
engineering systems. Robust design determines the 
most appropriate, optimizing set of parameters 
covering these design elements by identifying the 
settings of each parameter, which will minimize 
variation from the target performance of the product. 
To optimize the multiple quality characteristics 
problems, the desirability function approach is one of 
the most widely used methods in industry. When the 
product or process has nonlinear multiple dynamic 
quality characteristics, it is difficult to determine the 
optimal parameter conditions for all quality 
characteristics. This paper presents an approach to 
optimizing nonlinear multiple dynamic quality 
characteristics based on the double-exponential 
desirability function. The proposed procedure has 
been shown to successfully obtain the optimal 
parameter conditions.
