Abstract 
For digital communication, distributed 
storage and management of media contents 
over system holders are critical issues. An 
efficient verifiable sharing scheme is 
proposed that can satisfy significant 
essentials of distribution sharing and can 
achieve a lossless property of host media. 
Verifiability allows holders to detect and 
identify counterfeited shadows during 
cooperation in order to prevent cheaters. 
Only authorized holders can reveal the 
lossless shared content and then reconstruct 
the original host image. Shared media 
capacity is adjustable and proportional to 
the increase of the number of the distributed 
holders t. The more distributed holders, the 
larger the shared media capacity is. 
Moreover, the ability to reconstruct the 
image preserves the fidelity of valuable host 
media, such as military and medical images. 
According to the results, the proposed 
approach can achieve superior performance 
to that of related sharing schemes for 
effectively providing distributed media 
management and storage.

LIN: Media Sharing Scheme with Cheater Identification and Content Reconstruction 333
Eslami et al.[12] proposed a secret image sharing scheme 
based on cellular automata and steganography. This scheme 
embeds the shadows into each block by altering fewer bits 
of each block pixels in order to achieve better stego image 
quality than that of [9]−[11]. In [13], the scheme allowed 
the participants to repair the tampered regions of the secret 
image. Nevertheless, the capacity of the sharable secret 
image is limited to one quarter of the host image size as in 
[9], [10].  
Apart from the requirements of the meaningful stego 
image, lossless secret image, and verifiability, the 
reconstruction of the distorted host image is a practical 
essential for preserving the fidelity of the valuable host 
image, such as military, medical, and artistic images. That 
is, authorized participants can remove the embedded 
shadows from the stego image to restore the host image 
without loss. The reconstruction of the lossless host image 
can be widely applied to the e-commerce, communications, 
and multimedia fields[14],[15]. However, the methods[6],[9]−[13] 
are incapable of restoring the lossless host image now.  
To satisfy the essentials of a lossless host image,    
Lin et al.
   
[16] proposed a sharing scheme using a modulus 
operator. Their scheme permits the authorized participants 
to reveal the lossless secret image and to reconstruct the 
lossless host image. Moreover, they utilized Rabin’s 
signature algorithm[17] to generate a certificate for the 
purpose of verifiability. Using the certificate mechanism[16], 
Ulutas et al.[18] presented a medical image sharing scheme. 
However, the generation of the certificate[12],[16],[18] was 
computationally complex and time-consuming. 
To achieve the essentials of the meaningful stego image, 
verifiability, the lossless secret image, the lossless host 
image, and the maximum sharable capacity, a new media 
sharing approach is proposed in this paper. The proposed 
verifiable media sharing scheme allows for the protection 
and sharing of confidential multimedia among the 
distributed system holders. The shared media capacity is 
adjustable and proportional to the increase of t. That is, the 
more distributed holders, the larger the media capacity is. 
The rest of this article is organized as follows. The 
related work of Shamir’s (t, n)-threshold method is briefly 
introduced in Section 2. The proposed verifiable and 
recoverable image sharing scheme is discussed in Section 3, 
followed by the experimental results in Section 4. Finally, 
conclusions are made in Section 5. 
2. (t, n)-Threshold System  
The concept of Shamir’s (t, n)-threshold sharing 
approach[2] is described in this section. Given a shared 
secret s, a dealer determines a prime m and generates a 
(t−1)-degree polynomial as 
  1 11 1( ) ( ) mod 
t
tF x s a x a x
−
−= + + +"
where the coefficients a1, a2, ⋅⋅⋅, at−1 are randomly 
determined from integers within [0, m−1]. The dealer then 
computes the shadows as  
   1 2(1),  (2),  , ( )ny F y F y F n= = =" .       (2) 
Eventually, the dealer issues shadows yi to involved 
participants.  
Generally, we label a shadow set as a forbidden set if 
the number of participants is less than t. No one in the 
forbidden set can correctly reconstruct F(x) using the 
Lagrange interpolation polynomial. A shadow set is called a 
qualified set if the number of participants is greater than or 
equal to t. Authorized participants in a qualified set can 
cooperate to reconstruct F(x). That is, authorized 
participants can construct F(x) to recover all coefficients s, 
a1, a2, ⋅⋅⋅, at-1. In this way, the secret s can be obtained. 
Note that the values of generated shadows yi range 
within [0, m−1]. While forming those yi, they appear 
meaningless (random-like). To conceal the shadows from 
intruders, our proposed secret image sharing scheme 
produces n meaningful stego images by camouflaging the 
shadows in a host image. Besides, Shamir’s scheme is 
insecure against the cheating attacks. To prevent such 
malicious attempts, the new approach can detect the 
dishonest participants by verifying the contents of their 
shadows, as explained in Section 3. 
3. Proposed Scheme 
Given a shared media S and a host image O with H¯W 
pixels, the dealer can derive shadows from S and then 
generate n stego images by O in the (t, n)-threshold system, 
where 2< t ≤ n. The n stego images are subsequently 
dispatched to the corresponding system holders for the 
purpose of media distributed management and storage. The 
stego image generation procedure is introduced in 3.1. To 
extract the shared media S, any t out of n system holders can 
first verify the contents of the provided stego images with 
one another. The authorized holders can then cooperate to 
extract S and restore O without distortion. The verification 
and extraction procedure is discussed in 3.2.  
3.1 (t, n) VSS Procedure 
In the (t, n) verifiable secret sharing (VSS) system, the 
dealer must select a prime number m and an unique key Ki 
for the n system holders, where i=1, 2, ⋅⋅⋅, n, and Ki is 
unequal to a multiple of m. In the preliminary step, the 
dealer convers the shared media S into an m-ary notation 
system and generates the verification bit stream V.  
A. Shadow Derivation Phase 
The shadow derivation process generates shadows from 
S by the (t−1)-degree polynomial F(x). Instead of sharing 
one secret pixel in F(x)[9],[10],[13], the new approach shares 
t−2 secret digits to increase the shared media capacity. For m        (1)

4. Experimental Results 
In the simulations, different types of natural images are 
used as the host images as shown in Fig. 1. The size of the 
grayscale host images is 512¯512 pixels. Fig. 2 shows the 
shared image with 256¯256 pixels. Here, the prime 
number m=7.  
4.1 Simulation Results 
To evaluate the practicability of the distributed sharing 
approach, the quality of the derived stego image, lossless 
property, verifiability, and shared media capacity are the 
major concerns. Table 1 displays the quality of the derived 
stego images while sharing Fig. 2 with various host images 
in the (3, 3)-threshold system. The average peak 
signal-to-noise rate (PSNR) value of the stego images is 
around 34.2 dB no matter what host image is the carrier. 
That is, the new VSS approach is practical for normally 
distributed natural images and satisfies the purpose of 
steganography.  
Fig. 3 (b) through (d) demonstrates the corresponding 
stego images of the host image Lena (Fig. 3 (a)). The stego 
images can be dispatched to individual system holders for 
distributed management and storage. According to the 
extraction procedure, the authorized holders can cooperate 
to extract the shared image losslessly as shown in Fig. 3 (e) 
and then recover the original host image without distortion 
as shown in Fig. 3 (f). Hence, the new scheme can satisfy 
the lossless essential to protect the shared media and 
preserve the valuable host image.

Table 4 compares the capacity between related sharing 
schemes and the proposed scheme. The capacity of the 
sharable media among system holders should as large as 
possible in order to reduce the storage space and the 
communication bandwidth. Instead of embedding one 
shared pixel into F(x) with a 2¯2 pixels block[9],[10],[13], the 
new approach shares t−2 secret digits into F(x) for each 
pixel. The maximum capacity of the proposed scheme can 
be increased to 7( 2) log 255HW t − ⎡⎢ ⎤⎥ pixels, where m=7. 
The capacity of the schemes [11] and [18] is 
( )2514 log 255HWt ⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥  pixels, and the capacity of the 
scheme [12] is ( )251( 1) 4 log 255HW t − ⎡⎢ ⎤⎥  pixels. They 
split the shared pixels into the 251-ary notation system for 
the lossless purpose. Here, the block size was 2¯2 pixels in 
[11], [12], and 8 pixels in [18].  
More precisely, Fig. 7 compares the corresponding 
capacity of the shared media for related schemes and the 
new scheme under different settings of t. The maximum 
capacity of [11], [12], [16], and [18] was proportional to the 
increase of t. It is obvious that the proposed approach can 
share more media than the related schemes in most cases. 
The more distributed holders, the larger the shared media 
capacity is. That is, the new algorithm is quite suitable for 
sharing and managing the large media content among 
distributed system holders.
