Abstract 
 
CrAlN coatings were fabricated on WC 
substrates by RF magnetron sputtering.  
After annealing， formation of Cr2O3 would 
increase the surface roughness for both CrN 
and CrAlN coatings.  According to XRD 
profile, increase the content of Al the peak 
intensity of Cr2O3 decrease, which was 
excellent for oxidation resistance. Surface 
roughness of the CrAlN coatings were 
analyzed by AFM.  Therefore, comparable 
anti-oxidation behavior was expected for the 
CrAlN coatings. With 29 at.% Al doping, 
smaller surface roughness of lower than 
1.5nm was obtained after annealing due to 
the reduced crystallinity. And it was 
demonstrated that CrAlN coatings with 2.2 to 
29 at.% aluminum alloying exhibiting 
smooth surface roughness, could be 
considered to possess optimum composition 
                                                
operated at the elevated temperature in 
vacuum. 
Diffraction aberration of the molded lenses 
are resulted from large roughness of the 
molding die, so that roughness (Ra) of the 
deposits become a critical issue in fabrication.  
In this study, surface roughness of the CrAlN 
coatings with different Al alloying and 
CrN/AlN with different bilayer period were 
investigated.  Due to elevated working 
temperature in the glass molding process, the 
oxidation behaviors of CrN, CrAlN and 
CrN/AlN coatings were also taken into 
consideration.  After investigation of 
as-deposited and annealed coatings, 
feasibility test was accomplished for the 
selected coatings, and optimum composition 
of CrAlN deposit for practical usage in glass 
molding was proposed 
 
三、 結果與討論 
Part A 
 
A3.1. Composition and microstructure 
    The chromium based nitride coatings 
were obtained with thicknesses of 1.5-2 μm 
by RF magnetron sputtering.  As listed in 
Table 1, compositions of the deposits were 
determined by EPMA, and the stoichiometric 
CrN was comfirmed.  The aluminum 
content was controlled by the input power.  
 
Table 1.Summary of the coating 
characteristics * 
 
The crystallographic phases of the CrN 
and CrAlN coatings were analyzed by X-ray 
diffraction pattern.  Fig. 2. shows the face 
centered cubic phase of CrN.  The (111) 
peak of the f.c.c. structure was shifted from 
37.70o to 38.08o, as the aluminum contents 
increased to 29.0 at.%.  The peak shift 
toward the higher angle with increasing 
aluminum contents was attributed to be the 
shrink of the lattice due to solid solutioning 
of aluminum.

CrAlN coatings 
 
A3.2. Surface roughness 
A3.2.1. As-deposited coatings 
Surface roughness of the protective 
coatings on molding des is a critical issue for 
high-accuracy molding.  In general, surface 
roughness of the coatings with 10 nm is the 
maximum tolerable value for molding dies 
using in fabrication of optical devices.  The 
surface roughness (Ra) of the chromium 
nitride based coatings, measured by AFM in 
a scan of 1×1 µm2, is plotted in Fig. 3.  A 
significant reduction in Ra from 5.7 nm to 3 
nm was obtained after the addition of Al.  
The formation of a smoother surface has 
been attributed to a finer grained and denser 
structure.  With the addition of a amount of 
aluminum, a smoother surface with a Ra 
smaller than 3 nm was obtained.  With 
increasing aluminum doping, larger grain 
size inasmuch as preferable crystallization 
would cause larger roughness around 3 nm.

and 800oC annealed CrN based coatings. 
                                                
periods. The interface between CrN and AlN 
was flat and evident. A native oxide layer 
around 4 nm was also found on the Si 
substrate.  
 
Fig. 6. Bright field image of CrN/AlN 
coatings with modulation period of (a) 4 
nm,(b) 6.7 nm and (c) 10 nm. 
 
The cross section view of CrN and 
CrN/AlN coatings are shown in Fig. 7. The 
thickness of CrN and CrN/AlN coatings 
estimated from SEM image were 1.3 and 0.9 
µm, respectively. The microstructure of 
as-deposited CrN coating exhibited a 
fine-grained dense morphology. Conversely, 
the CrN/AlN multilayer coatings showed a 
dense columnar structure. After heat 
treatment at 800oC in vacuum for 1 hr, the 
cross sectional microstructure of a CrN 
coating transformed from a fine-grained 
morphology to a dense columnar structure. 
Also, the multilayer coatings after 800oC in 
vacuum for 1 hr still maintained a dense 
columnar structure. On the other hand, the 
cross section view of a CrN coating exhibited 
not only loose but also rough morphology 
after 800oC in air for the identical time as 
that in vacuum. In fact, the interface between 
CrN and oxide layer could not be well 
distinguished. A similar phenomenon was 
observed by Ichimura [25]. Nevertheless, the 
SEM micrograph of multilayer CrN/AlN 
coatings in Fig. 7.(f) still possessed a dense 
columnar structure as that in the 
heat-treatment state in air at 800oC for 1 hr. 
The diffraction patterns of as-deposited 
CrN/AlN coatings with 4 nm showed f.c.c 
CrN/AlN structure and no wurtzite AlN 
structure was observed. This indicated that 
the hexagonal structure of AlN was 
transformed into the metastable cubic 
structure when the modulation period of 
multilayer CrN/AlN was 4 nm [26-28]. As 
shown in Fig. 8. (a), the diffraction pattern of 
CrN coating at 800oC in vacuum became 
sharper as compared with the as-deposited 
coating. Conversely, the CrN/AlN coatings 
still exhibited broad peaks, implying that the 
grain of film did not grow up. In fact, the 
major CrN (111) and CrN (200) for CrN and 
CrN/AlN coatings all move toward higher 
angle, indicating the stress relaxation after 
heat treatment. On the other hand, the CrN 
coating was oxidized and Cr2O3 was formed 
at 800oC in air for 1 hr, while no Cr2O3 peak 
in the CrN/AlN coatings could be found. 
Therefore, CrN/AlN coating possessed better 
thermal stability than CrN coating if 
oxidation is concerned.

B3.1.2 Mechanical properties and thermal 
                                                
 
Fig. 11. Low angle X-ray diffraction 
patterns of CrN/AlN coating with 
modulation period of 4 nm before and 
after annealed at various temperatures in 
vacuum for 1 hr. 
 
Figure 12 plots the relationship between 
the hardness of single layer CrN and 
multilayered CrN/AlN coating with different 
modulation periods. The hardness of both 
CrN/AlN coatings was unchanged up to 
500oC for 1 hr in air environment. However, 
the hardness of CrN coating decreased 
rapidly to 9.9 GPa as annealing temperature 
reached 700oC. Relatively speaking, the 
decrease in hardness for the multilayer 
CrN/AlN coating was much slighter than that 
of CrN coating. The degradation ratios at 
700oC for CrN and CrNN/AlN with 4 nm 
were 50.5% and 8.1%, respectively. For 
annealing up to 800oC, the hardness of the 
CrN coating could not be measured, because 
of rougher surface morphology caused by 
severe oxidation. This could be evidenced 
from the X-ray diffraction analysis, and films 
were detached from the substrate.  
 
Fig. 12. Hardness of CrN and CrN/AlN 
coatings as a function of annealing 
temperatures in air for 1 hr. 
On the contrary, the hardness of the 
multilayer coatings with 4 nm and 12.3 nm 
periods, after heat treatment at 800oC, were 
maintained as high as 23.5±0.8 GPa and 20.2 
± 0.2 GPa, respectively, which were only 
16.7 % and 22.6 % lower than that of the 
as-deposited coatings. Harish reported that 
the hardness of TiAlN and TiN/AlN coatings 
exhibited hardness of 22 GPa and 28 GPa, 
which were 42.9 % and 22.2 % lower than 
that of as-deposited films after heating at 
700oC for 30 min in air [26]. Besides, Harish 
also presented that TiAlN/CrN multilayer 
coating with modulation period of 5.6 nm 
still exhibited 26 GPa at 800 oC and 
degradation ratio was 33.3 % [31]. As a 
result, the CrN/AlN coatings could maintain 
excellent strength even when annealed at the 
elevated temperature in air. 
In comparison the CrN and CrN/AlN 
coatings annealed in vacuum and in air, the 
hardness of both coatings at various 
temperatures in vacuum remained nearly 
unchanged, while they decreased after 500oC 
in air. The difference in hardness at the 
identical temperature may be due to the 
oxidation layer grown on the top of the 
coatings. During the indentation test with a 
load of 5 mN applied on the coating, the 
maximum indentation depth of both coatings 
was below 100 nm. As a result, if the soft 
and loose oxide layer produced on the top of 
both coatings, the hardness of the coatings 
would decrease significantly with annealing 
temperatures. Thus, the ability to resist the 
oxidation attack strongly affects the thermal 
stability of the coating at the elevated 
temperature in air. 
 
B3.2.1 Phase identification and 
microstructure 
Cross section TEM micrograph of the 
CrN/AlN multilayer coating is presented in 
Fig. 13. The thin amorphous layer observed 
on the Si substrate was native SiO2. Before 
deposition of multilayer coating, Cr layer 
was first deposited as interlayer to improve 
adhesion strength between Si substrate and 
nitride coating. The initial layer coated on 
the interlayer was CrN. The bright and dark 
layers indicated AlN and CrN coatings, 
respectively, which was due to the difference 
                                                
the CrN/AlN coating with modulation period 
of 4 nm exhibited a dense and smooth cross 
sectional morphology as well as dense top 
layer, as compared with CrN and CrN/AlN 
coating with larger period. 
 
 
Fig. 16. (a) SEI and (b) BEI of CrN/AlN 
coating with modulation period of 12.3 nm 
at 900oC in air for 1 hr. 
 
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the 
as-deposited CrN and CrN/AlN coatings with 
modulation period of 4 nm and 12.3 nm at 
600, 700, 750, 800, and 900oC annealing are 
presented in Fig. 17. The diffraction pattern 
of as-deposited CrN coating located at 36.88o 
and 42.96o indicated the combined CrN and 
Cr2N peaks. Besides, the diffraction peak all 
shifted to lower angle, indicating the 
existence of compressive stress in the 
as-deposited CrN coating. After heat 
treatment at 600oC for 1 h, CrN (111) and 
Cr2N (111) separated and shifted to higher 
angle as compared to that of as-deposited 
CrN (111). This implied the evidence of 
stress relaxation for the CrN coating during 
heat treatment, which was also observed in 
literature [32]. The cause for the compressive 
stress was due to the ion bombardment on the 
substrate [33].  
 
 
Fig. 17. X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) 
CrN, (b) CrN/AlN with 12.3nm and (c) 
CrN/AlN with  4 nm at as-deposited and 
heat-treated states. 
It should be pointed out that Cr2O3 (104) 
was detected at 600oC. In fact, CrN coating 
was oxidized seriously as further increasing 
temperature above 600oC. From the results of 
X-ray diffraction patterns in Figs. 17.(b) and 
17.(c), as-deposited CrN/AlN coatings with 
12.3 nm showed CrN (111), CrN (220) and 
wurtzite AlN (100). With reducing the 
modulation period to 4 nm, AlN (111) peak 
disappeared. When CrN/AlN coatings was 
heated at 600oC, 700oC, and 750oC, oxide 
Cr2O3 and Al2O3 peaks were not observed in 
the diffraction patterns. The Cr2O3 peak for 
multilayer CrN/AlN coating with 12.3 nm 
appeared at 800oC. However, CrN/AlN 
coating with 4 nm showed no oxide peak in 
the diffraction patterns even after 800oC. In 
addition, for CrN/AlN coating with 
modulation period of 4 nm at 900℃, the 
diffraction pattern did not exhibit any oxide 
peak, yet a thin layer was observed on the top 
of the coating. Kawate suggested that the thin 
layer on the top of the CrAlN coating was 
amorphous Al2O3, which protected coating 
from oxidation [34]. As a result, CrN/AlN 
coatings with smaller modulation period 
exhibited better resistance to oxidation. The 
oxidation resistance of CrN/AlN coatings 
was much better than that of CrN coatings.  
Furthermore, the peak shift at 
as-deposited and 600oC in the CrN/AlN 
multilayer coatings was also observed, which 
was similar to that of CrN coating. Fig. 18. 
demonstrates the peak position of CrN (111) 
as a function of annealing temperature. The 
position of CrN (111) was unchanged when 
annealed above 600oC, implying that the 
stress was released. On the basis of the X-ray 
diffraction patterns, Cr2O3 formed after 
annealing above 600oC. This indicated that 
the stress release could be related to the 
formation of oxide. On the contrary, the 
position of CrN (111) in the CrN/AlN 
coating with modulation period of 4 nm 
shifted toward the higher angle with 
increasing temperature and no Cr2O3 was 
observed even at 900oC. It was thus believed 
that the formation of oxide in the coating 
would induce the stress relaxation.
