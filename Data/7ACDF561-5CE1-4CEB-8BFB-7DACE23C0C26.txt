1. Abstract
Nanostructured manganese oxide
electrodes are fabricated directly by
electrochemical deposition. Surface
morphology of the electrode deposited at high
current density shows nanowires with
diameter 12-16 nm distributed randomly.
Nanowires tend to aggregate to clumps when
the deposition current density is low. Both
annealing temperature and deposition current
density affect the intercalation and
deintercalation of lithium ions within the
deposited manganese oxide cathode in an
aqueous lithium sulfate electrolyte. An
optimal annealing temperature is found to be
300 oC in terms of the electrode’s specific
capacity during high-rate charging/discharging.
An electrode with thinner nanowires deposited
at high current density has a high specific
capacity because thinner nanowires shorten
the diffusion of lithium ions and in favor of
high-rate charging/discharging.
Keywords: manganese oxide, lithium
storage, cathode material, nanostructured
materials, and aqueous lithium-ion batteries.
2. Introduction
There are many different forms of
manganese dioxide such as-MnO2,-MnO2,
and -MnO2 for lithium battery cathode
material. Generally, crystal structure of the
manganese oxides influences intercalation and
deintercalation of lithium ions during
electrochemical reaction. -MnO2 has low
electrochemical stability because it contains (2
× 2) tunnels within its structure [1-4]. To
enhance the structural instability of -MnO2,
cations such as Ba2+ or K+ were added during
synthesis because they can take up
crystallographic sites within the (2×2) tunnels
[4]. Although structural stability of -MnO2
has been improved by cation addition, a
drawback is that electrochemical performance
would be significantly limited by a
cation-hindered and hence lowered diffusion
rate of lithium ions [4,5].
-MnO2 structure is more stable in the
manganese dioxide family because its
structure consists of narrow (1×1) tunnels [4].
However, this stable structure obstructs the
intercalation and deintercalation of lithium
ions, therefore results a low capacity [6].
Specific capacity of -MnO2 can be much
improved by decreasing the degree of
crystallinity, but the charge/discharge reaction
can not be fully reversed [7,8]. -MnO2
structure consists of intergrown domains of
-MnO2 and ramsdellite-MnO2 in which the
ramsdellite-MnO2 embeds (2×1) tunnels [4,9].
Reports have stated the reversible
intercalation and deintercalation of lithium
ions occur mainly in the ramsdellite-MnO2
domain of -MnO2 [10,11]. Generally,
chemical or electrochemical synthesized
-MnO2 material contains water on the grain
surface or grain boundary. Water can be
removed by heating the substance to 375 oC
[12].
3mg. Surface morphology of the
electrochemically deposited electrode was
examined with a scanning electron
microscope (FE-SEM, Jeol JEOL-6330, USA)
with an accelerating voltage of 15 keV.
Crystal structures of the deposited manganese
oxide were identified by a glance angle X-ray
diffractometer (GAXRD, Rigaku D/
MAX2500, Japan) with a Cu K target
(wavelength = 1.54056 Å). A beaker-type
electrochemical cell comprised of a working
electrode (manganese oxide electrode), a
counter electrode (platinum foil), and a
reference electrode (SCE) was used to
determine the electrochemical performance of
deposited manganese oxide electrodes. The
electrolyte was 1 M lithium sulfate (Li2SO4)
aqueous solution. Charge/discharge and
cycle-life stability were performed by a
charge/discharge unit (Hokuto Denko
HJ-201B, Japan) in the potential range of 0 V
to 1.1 V versus SCE at constant current. All
data acquisition functions in Hokuto Denko
were carried out through an interface card
(Labjack U12, USA) with LabVIEW software.
Electrodes were charged at constant current to
a cutoff potential of 1.1 V versus SCE.
Discharge was performed at the same rate to a
cutoff potential of 0 V versus SCE. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) measurements were taken
by means of a potentiostat/galvanostat (CH
Instruments CHI 608, USA). The potential
was cycled in the range of 0 V to 1.2 V versus
SCE at a scan rate of 25 mVs-1.
4. Results and discussion
Previous results indicated that the deposited
manganese oxides of annealing temperatures
lower than 300 oC resemble closely to
-Mn(O,OH)2 (-manganese oxide hydroxide),
but it decomposes to Mn2O3 at temperatures
beyond 500 oC [24]. In order to avoid
structural destruction by water contamination,
the annealing temperature has been set at 300
oC. Figure 1 shows the surface morphology of
manganese oxide electrode deposited
electrochemically at different current densities
after annealing at 300 oC for 1 h. Morphology
of the deposited manganese oxide at a high
current density of 0.125 mAcm-2 (Fig. 1a)
shows nanowires with diameter of 12~16 nm
and distributes randomly on the SS substrate.
Nanowires tend to aggregate into clumps of
diameter about 100 nm (Fig. 1b) when current
density is decreased to 0.025 mAcm-2. Current
density of the deposition is important in
controlling the surface morphology of the
deposited manganese oxide film, which in
turns affect its electrochemical performance. It
is generally believed that nano-structured
materials have higher specific surface area and
fast redox reactions; in addition, ion diffusion
within the structure dominates high-rate
charging and discharging performances of the
electrode. Diffusion resistance of ions (lithium
ions) within the materials can be mitigated by
shortening the diffusion path; therefore,
electrode materials with nano-sized wires may
be advantageous in high-rate performances.
Figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of
the deposited manganese oxide electrodes
after annealing at different temperatures:
electrolyte is 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous solution
and CV scan rate is 25 mVs-1. The potential
was cycled between 0 V and 1.2 V versus SCE
corresponding to a range of 3.3 V to 4.5 V
versus Li/Li+ in nonaqueous electrolyte. When
the heating temperature exceeds 200 oC, two
distinct redox current peaks may be observed:
an anodic peak at ca. 0.9 V and a cathodic
peak at ca. 0.75 V versus SCE. Based on
previous reports [25,26], appearances of redox
peaks indicate an irreversible intercalation/
5conductivity and electrode potential1 [30,31].
Moreover, water creates challenges in lithium
battery application because of lithium
instability with water and decomposition of
water during charge/discharge processes.
Specific capacity of the electrode after
annealing at 100 oC is lower than that
annealed at 300 oC. Hydrated water content
affects lithium ion storage in the manganese
oxide electrode; therefore an electrode after
300 oC annealing has the highest specific
capacity in all discharging current densities,
because water has largely been removed by
this high temperature. For temperature higher
than 500 oC, the deposited manganese oxide
decomposes to Mn2O3. A structural change
such as this may affect the intercalation and
deintercalation of lithium ions, therefore
decreasing its specific capacity.
Figure 6 shows the effect of
electrochemical deposition current density on
the specific capacity of manganese oxide.
Specific capacity of the manganese oxide
electrode deposited at high current density of
0.125 mAcm-2 is higher than that of low
current density of 0.025 mAcm-2. As
mentioned previously, morphology of the
manganese oxide changes with the current
density during deposition. Electrode deposited
at high current density of 0.125 mAcm-2
consists of nanowires with diameter 12-16 nm
distributed randomly on the SS substrate.
These distributed nanowires facilitate
intercalation and deintercalation of lithium
ions, possibly, due to both the increased active
surface area and the shortened diffusion path.
An electrode deposited at low current density
of 0.025 mAcm-2 has nanowires in clumps
which lead to an increased diffusion resistance.
It is generally believed that redox reactions in
manganese oxide electrode involve lithium
ion intercalation into the electrode, while
lithium ions diffusion (mass-transfer
resistance) controls the specific capacity at
high-rate discharging. Therefore, an electrode
with distributed nanowires has the highest
specific capacity throughout the entire
measured current density range because these
nanowires shorten the proton diffusion and in
favor of high-rate charging/discharging. In
addition, electrode of high depositing current
has a highly porous structure for electrolyte
access, which also improves the high-rate
discharge capability.
Figure 7a shows the effect of annealing
temperature on cycle-life stability of the
deposited manganese oxide electrode.
Charging and discharging current density are
set at 4.6 Ag-1. For electrodes annealed below
300 oC, a poor stability is observed: specific
capacity decreases from 62 mAhg-1 to 50
mAhg-1 after 150 charging/discharging cycles.
Hydrated water content is believed to affects
cycle-life performance. From Fig. 7a, an
enhanced cycle-life performance is seen with
increasing the annealing temperature.
However, electrodes annealed at temperatures
exceeding 300 oC have very little difference in
their cycle-life performance, because most
hydrated water content has already been
removed. Figure 7b shows the effect of
electrochemical depositing current density on
cycle-life stability of the manganese oxides
after annealing at 300 oC for 1 h. The effect is
small. Therefore, cycle-life stability of a
deposited manganese oxide electrode is
mainly determined by the annealing
temperature rather than the current density
during deposition.
