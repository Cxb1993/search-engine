Abstract 
 
The liquid phase wetting at grain boundaries 
in various Sn–rich In alloys was studied. The 
morphology and phase structure were analyzed 
by means of optical microscopy, X-ray 
diffraction and transmission electron 
microscopy, respectively. It was found that the 
extent of grain boundary wetting transition in 
these alloys depends on the annealing 
temperature. According to the results from the 
quantification of wetted grain boundaries, the 
minimal temperature of wetting was not 
observed and the maximal temperature of 
wetting is 164°C at which all of grain 
boundaries were wetted. Simultaneously, the 
electric conductivity of the 25% In–Sn alloy in 
dependence of the annealing temperature was 
also investigated. 
 
Keywords: wetting, Sn-In alloy, grain boundary,

1. Introduction 
 
The concept of environmental protection 
advocated and the need for electric devices 
designed more micro miniature attaches 
importance to the development of lead-free 
solder materials gradually in recent years. The 
reliability of solders is in relation to the 
interfacial properties of lead-free solder 
materials closely. The influences of interfaces 
such as grain or interphase boundaries can be 
improved by using the alloying technology of 
metals. 
The appearance of liquid phase and the 
penetration of liquid metal along grain 
boundaries (GBs) are important physical 
phenomena for understanding the 
microstructure of polycrystalline solid materials 
(metals, alloys, ceramics etc.). The occurrence 
of liquid phase wetting at GBs influences many 
material properties. The condition of wetting is 
related to the microstructure of materials, grain 
boundaries and interface between liquid and 
solid. The thermodynamic criterion of grain 
boundary wetting is the Gibbs-Smith condition 
[1] which the GB energy, γGB should be higher 
than twice value of solid-liquid interfacial 
energy, 2γSL, 
γGB ＞ 2γSL     (1) 
A GB is completely wetted by a liquid phase, 
and its dihedral angle θ = 0°. On the other hand, 
if a GB is not wetted, its dihedral angle can be 
estimate by using the formula

Eq.(2) was derived from the balance between 
neighboring solid grains and liquid phase and is 
the important meaningful characteristic for 
liquid phase wetting at GBs. Some reports 
described the condition of wetting by utilizing 
the dihedral angle [2-4]. 
Although the mechanism of liquid phase 
wetting at GBs still remained unclear, the 
phenomena and behaviors evolved have been 
investigated. Volovich et al. proposed a model 
describing the wetting at various structural 
elements (boundaries, triple lines and 
quaternary nodes between grains) in 
polycrystals [5]. Takashima et al. studied the 
liquid Cu in an Fe–Mn–Cu alloy as a function 
of five degrees of freedom and indicated that 
poor correlation between the wetting behavior 
at GBs and the misorientation angle [6]. 
Straumal et al. investigated the wetting at GBs 
in annealed Zn–5 wt% Al alloy. They indicated 
that the critical temperature of liquid phase 
wetting at GBs is different for GBs with 
different energies. The fraction of wetted 
boundaries depends on the annealing 
temperature and not on annealing time [7]. 
Besides, the wetting transition at GBs in a 
lead-free solder alloy is also devoted to 
understand [8-9]. 
The Sn–In binary alloy is the one of the most 
potential materials for lead-free solders in 
electronic industries. However, the literature 
about the wetting phase transition at GBs in 
Sn-In alloys in the Sn-rich site of the Sn–In 
phase diagram is still very seldom. The goal of 
this research was to investigate the phenomena 
of liquid phase wetting at GBs in Sn-In alloys at 
various annealing temperatures. Simultaneously, 
the influence of the liquid phase wetting at GBs 
on electric property was also studied.

temperature of 120°C for 10 hr, the β phase and 
a small amount of γ phase transfer into liquid 
phase (light region) and γ solid phase structure 
becomes coarse and streak dark grains.  
The γ solid phase is permeated by liquid 
phase gradually as the annealing temperature 
increasing. It can be observed in sequence from 
Fig. 2(c) to (e) that the liquid phase penetrated 
the γ streaked structure and formed a granular 
structure between 136 and 145°C. Above 150°C, 
the solid phase grains began to reduce and be 
replaced by liquid phase. Although the result of 
optical micrograph analysis of Sn65In35 alloy is 
difficult to interpret, it is understandable in 
aspect of wetting phase transition at GBs. 
Fig. 3 shows the micrograph of as-prepared 
and annealed specimens of Sn75In25 alloy. The 
as-prepared specimen possesses a similar fine 
lamellar structure and no grain can be observed 
after chemical etching (Fig. 3a). After annealing 
at temperatures above the eutectic point for 10 
hr, the microstructures evolved show distinct 
changes from the initial one. The micrograph of 
the specimen annealed at 135°C (Fig. 3b) 
shows that the lamellar structure transferred 
into a granular structure. The liquid phase (light 
region) penetrates into the grain boundaries. 
Parts of GBs were fully wetted by liquid phase 
because these GBs had higher energy than 
others, at which the wetting transition occurs at 
lower temperature. The percentage of wetted 
GBs approximates to 27% at 135°C (see 
Fig.4).As the annealing temperature increases 
to 142°C, more GBs in the specimen are wetted. 
The percentage of wetted GBs increases to 52%. 
Above 150°C, more than 60% of all GBs 
observed are wetted and some inclusions appear 
in the interior of the grains.  
When the annealing temperature is higher 
than 150°C, the solid grains contain some liquid 
inclusions. When the alloy undergoes 
quenching, the liquid inclusions solidify and a 
lamellar structure forms. Fig. 3(h) shows the 
lamellar structure transformed from liquid 
phase after quenching. Thereafter, all the GBs 
of Sn75In25 alloy are completely wetted and 
some liquid phase boundaries become coarser 
gradually with increasing annealing temperature 
up to 164°C. Much more inclusions are found 
in the interior of grains.

the annealing temperature is raised up to 164°C 
or 177°C, the situation changes itself. Although 
more liquid phase exits initially, their 
composition is similar that of the γ phase stable 
at ambient temperature. As a result, the most of 
liquid phase transferred into the γ phase. In the 
sample annealed at 164°C only a little of liquid 
phase transferred to β phase after quenching 
and in that annealed at 177°C almost no β phase 
is found. This causes that the β- phase peak 
reduced. 
We have also tried to analyze the crystal 
structure of Sn–In alloys by means of 
transmission electron microscopy. From the 
TEM bright field image shown in Fig. 7, it can 
be seen that the γ phase region of the Sn75In25 
specimen annealed at 159°C (refer to Fig. 3(e)) 
has uniform features and the structure belongs 
to single crystal. 
 
3.3 Electrical Conductivity Measurement 
 
Since that the Sn–In solder is the potential 
material for lead-free solders and the wetting at 
GBs in solders affects the electric performance 
of solders, the electric conductivities of Sn75In25 
specimens as-prepared and annealed were 
measured. The result is shown in Fig. 8. First, 
the electric conductivity of as-prepared 
specimen was 5.81×104 S/cm. After annealing 
at 135°C for 10 hr, the electric conductivity of 
the alloy decreases to 4.99×104 S/cm because 
the initial structure changed to grain structure 
and the appearance of GBs caused to prevent 
electrons from going through the interior of this 
specimen directly. However, as the annealing 
temperature increases to 142°C, the electric 
conductivity increased back to 5.78×104 S/cm 
which closed to the value of the specimen 
as-prepared. In the specimens annealed at other 
temperatures, the extent of wetted GBs still 
increased but no great variation of the electric 
conductivities of Sn75In25 specimens is 
observed. The slight decrease in electrical 
conductivity may be conducted with the 
depletion of indium in the primary γ phase. 
Besides, it is conjectured that GBs which were 
fully wetted by liquid phase can assist electrons 
in increasing the mobility in the grain structure 
of Sn75In25 alloy.

Conclusion 
 
The liquid phase wetting at GBs in Sn65Sn35, 
Sn75In25 and Sn80In20 alloys as prepared and 
annealed at various annealing temperatures was 
studied. The percentage of GBs completely 
wetted depends on the annealing temperature. 
According to the results from the metallo-

Part 2 Report from the Russian Side 
 
The polycrystalline Cu–Ag, Cu–In, Cu–Co, Cu–Bi, In–Sn, Zn–Sn, and Zn–In alloys have been 
prepared. The grain boundary (GB) wetting phase transition in the S+L area of In–Sn, Zn–Sn and 
Zn–In bulk phase diagrams have been studied. As a result of the measurements using coarse-grained 
polycrystalline specimens and bicrystals, the maximal and minimal possible temperature for the GB 
wetting phase transition in the S+L area of In–Sn, Zn–Sn and Zn–In bulk phase diagrams have been 
obtained. The respective tie-lines of GB wetting phase transition in the S+L area have been 
experimentally constructed for In–Sn, Zn–Sn, and Zn–In alloys. In bicrystals the contact angles 
have been measured on the cross-sections of the annealed and quenched samples. The temperature 
dependence of the contact angle between GB and two solid-liquid IBs has been measured using 
optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the quenched samples after 
annealing at various temperatures. In polycrystals the contact angles have been measured on the 
large array (typically from 100 to 3000) of GBs. Such measurements delivered the statistics of the 
distribution of wetted and non-wetted GBs.

The GB grooving and faceting of a cylindrical tilt grain boundary in Cu and Cu – 16×10–3 at. % Bi 
bicrystals have been studied. The crystal lattices of both grains form a superlattice called 
coincidence site lattice (CSL) with an inverse density of coincidence sites relating to the density of 
lattice sites Σ=3 and Σ=9. The Σ3 and Σ9 <110> tilt GBs became faceted upon annealing at 0.95 Tm. 
The ratio of GB energy σGB and surface energy σsur of the specimen was measured, applying 
atomic force microscopy, from the profile of the GB thermal groove formed upon additional 
annealing. The 16×10–3 at. %  Bi concentration in the Bi-containing bicrystal is between GB and 
bulk solidus lines in the Cu–Bi phase diagram. In this concentration region GBs contain a 
multilayer Bi-rich prewetting film which is supposed to be liquid-like. Wulff-Herring diagrams 
were constructed using measured σGB / σsur values, revealing stable and metastable GB facets.

The temperature dependences of contact angle for tilt GBs 66° and 19° <1,0,–1,0> in Zn in the 
contact with In-rich melt has been measured. The GB wetting phase transition occurs at different 
temperatures (373+1°C and 362+1°C, respectively). It has been observed for the first time that 
temperature dependences of contact angle intersect (at about 350°C) 
 
The anneals for the investigation of GB “wetting by solid phase” transformations are continuing 
with Cu–Ag, Cu–In, Cu–Co, In–Sn, Zn–Sn, and Zn–In alloys. The homogenization anneals are 
continuing for the further investigation of accelerated equilibration of a supersaturated solid 
solution in nanograined alloys. The first data on accelerated decomposition of supersaturated solid 
solution during the SPD deformation in Cu–Co systems have been obtained. The EPMA method has 
been applied for characterization of microstructure of Cu–Ag, Cu–Co, and Cu–In alloys after 
preliminary anneals.  
 
Two papers were published in Def. Diff. Forum, one paper was published in Acta Materialia , one

submission to Mater. Sci. Engn. , and Def. Diff. Forum. Therefore, all goals planned for the second 
year have been successfully reached and preparation works for the third year are running in time.
