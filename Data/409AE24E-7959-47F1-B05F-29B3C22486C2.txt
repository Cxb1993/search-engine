Abstract 
 
This research describes board-level drop reliability of TFBGA subjected to 
JEDEC drop test condition which features an impact pulse profile with a peak 
acceleration of 1500G and a pulse duration of 0.5 ms. The solder ball is assumed as an 
elastoplastic model, and the other components are assumed to be linear elastic models. 
Both the global/local finite element method and the finite grid region method are 
introduced to improve the accuracy and the convergence during the meshing process. 
Meanwhile the contact impact process during the dropping test is translated into the 
effective support excitation load on the PCB through the support excitation scheme to 
simplify the analysis.  
By means of optimal parameters of the Taguchi robust design, the average 
stress of the solder ball at PCB side surface becomes 80.9Mpa which shows a 57% 
reduction compared to the original stress of 189.7Mpa. As a result, the impact 
reliability of the TFBGA package has been significantly improved. Finally the JEDEC 
drop test is conducted to verify the optimal results by Taguchi method

enhanced the computational efficiency. In 2006, Yeh et al. [5] applied TFBGA with 
chip scale packages mounted on a standard JEDEC drop test board through SAC405, 
SAC 305 and Sn-37Pb solder joints to conduct the board-level drop test and achieve 
results by the finite element method. The results showed that IMC layer of PCB was 
more easily damaged than other components, and while increasing numbers of drops 
test for lead-free solder balls, the maximum normal stress on the IMC layer almost 
kept the same. Therefore, using IMC layer maximum normal stress as an index of 
drop impact prediction was available. In 2007, Tsai et al.[6] presented a submodeling 
analysis for solving transient mechanical responses of board-level electronic packages 
subjected to drop impact loads, involving large deformations and nonlinear 
elastoplastic constitutive relationships for the solder alloy. Moreover, it focused on 
the verification of this submodeling analysis procedure and the investigation on 
solution deviations caused by several abbreviated global models that involved 
simplified geometry or material properties for the solder balls. In 2008, Tsai et al. [7] 
obtained the optimal design by the Taguchi optimization method in enhancing 
board-level drop reliability of a wafer-level chip-scale package (WLCSP) under 
JEDEC drop test condition. An orthogonal array was arranged for the optimization of 
four control factors that involved compositions of solder alloys, thickness of die and 
polyimide passivation layers. The submodeling technique capable for dealing with 
path-dependent features, including elastoplastic responses of solder joints and 
structural nonlinearity under drop impacts, was applied so that dedicated structures of 
passivation under bump metallurgy (UBM) and redistribution line (RDL) in a 
WLCSP package could be taken into account. In other words, effects of such control 
factors on the drop reliability of WLCSP were compared and ranked. 
2. JEDEC drop test 
   Experiments were carried out to investigate board-level drop reliability of 
thin-profile fine-pitch ball grid array (TFBGA) chip-scale package assemblies 
subjected to JEDEC drop test condition B. The JEDEC drop test was pulse controlled 
type and load was half-since acceleration impact pulse. Each measured IC and PCB 
was connected by Daisy chain circuit in which this circuit was bound on test board 
with the copper wire. During repetitive drops, the overall electrical resistance of the 
solder joints for each package on the test board was monitored every 100 ns by an 
event detector, ETAC ED-70S. The failure criterion was defined as that whenever the 
overall electrical resistance of solder joints of a package exceeding 1000Ω was 
detected and followed by three additional such events during five subsequent drops. 
During repetitive drops, the electrical resistance of the solder joint might increase 
abruptly at a certain moment due to the breakage of the solder joint resulting from the 
excessive bending of the board. At the subsequent moment, however, the test board

4.1 Design of experiments 
   According to the numbers of control factors and their levels, a L18 (21x37) 
orthogonal array which includes18 experiments is presented. 
4.2 Results of experiments 
Following the L18 (21x37) orthogonal array, the S/N ratio of each factor response  
and the factor response diagram for S/N ratio corresponding to normal stress is shown 
is in Fig.4. According to the S/N ratio responses, the composition of solder alloys 
(Factor D) has the most influence on the average normal stress between solder balls 
and PCB interface. The rest of the factors are ranked as the following orders: the 
radius of lower solder ball pad (Factor C), solder balls arrangement and package size 
(Factor E), die thickness (Factor A), compound thickness (Factor G), the radius of 
upper solder ball pad (Factor B), substrate thickness (Factor F) and compound 
Young’s module (Factor H).  
Through ANOVA and S/N ratio response, the optimal set of control factors is 
A1、C3、D3、E1、G1. The comparison for the original and optimal design of process 
parameters are shown in Table 6. The average normal stress between solder balls and 
drop test vehicle interface is 189.74MPa under the original process design, while it is 
only 80.9MPa under the optimal process design. Therefore, a significant improvement 
of 57% is found so that the damage of the solder ball can be reduced. 
5. Verification of the optimal results from Taguchi method 
There are totally 10 groups of experiments as shown on Table 10. To save time 
and cost the experiments, 4 test boards are assigned for each group, in which only one 
IC is located at the center of the test board for 600 drops and the characteristic life is 
recorded as 63.2 % for the drop test. Then the average value including 4 test boards is 
adopted. Among those results, the first group is recognized as the optimal one which 
is consistent to the prediction value obtained by the Taguchi analysis. Furthermore, 
the 1st and the 2nd groups show that the characteristic life decreases from 370 to 325 
along with the reduction of the lower radius of the solder ball pad from 0.15mm to 
0.13mm. This result verifies that the peel stress of the intermetallic compound 
increases with the decrease of the lower radius of the solder ball so that the 
characteristic life reduces for the drop test. The 1st and the 3rd groups show that the 
characteristic life decreases from 370 to 335 along with the increase of the package 
size from 9x9mm to 11x11mm. It verifies that the peel stress of the intermetallic 
compound increases with the increase of the package size so that the characteristic life 
reduces for the drop test. The 1st and the  4th groups show that that the characteristic 
life decreases from 370 to 345 along with the increase of the die thickness from 
0.15mm to 0.35mm. It verifies that the peel stress of the intermetallic compound 
increases with the increase of the die thickness so that the characteristic life reduces
