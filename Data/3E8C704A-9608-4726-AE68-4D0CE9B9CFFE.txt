and performance characteristics of a system 
can be verified by using a Lyapunov 
function approach [2-7]. The basic idea of 
existing control design methodology is to 
design a feedback gain for each local model 
and then to construct a global controller 
from these local gains so that the global 
stability of the overall fuzzy system is 
guaranteed. Such a control design approach 
easily leads to a set of coupled matrix 
inequalities that include both a common 
positive definite matrix and each feedback 
gain in each fuzzy rule. However, it is easy 
to see that when the number of rules 
become large, the problem may become 
difficult to solve. In fact, for some more 
complicated nonlinear systems, the more 
rules is required in the T-S model with 
linear consequent parts to describe the 
system under a sufficient accuracy. 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that in a 
T-S fuzzy model, the consequence could be 
any functions. Thus, this paper attempts to 
study the control design problem, in which 
the consequences of T-S models with affine 
nonlinear dynamic systems are used to 
represent the considered systems. Hence, 
for some complicated nonlinear systems, a 
T-S model with the affine nonlinear 
consequences may need fewer rules to 
model.  
The concept of control Lyapunov 
functions (CLFs) has been a cornerstone of 
recent developments in robust control for 
nonlinear systems [8], [9], [10]. A positive 
definite, radically unbounded function 
 is a CLF if, at any , its time 
derivative can be made negative-definite by 
a choice of the control input. Recently, there 
has been a great activity in designing 
feedback controller by means of CLF’s due 
to an explicit formula for the feedback 
obtained by Sontag [13]. Namely, the 
existence of a CLF is equivalent to 
stabilizability via feedback. Once a CLF is 
known, nonlinear feedback fuzzy 
controllers in each fuzzy rule can be 
obtained directly by Sontag’s formula [13] 
and the global controller guarantee the 
stability of the close loop system.  
( )V x nx∈ℜ
The objective of our study is to design 
fuzzy controllers that can be a nonlinear 
controller for each fuzzy rule and can 
guarantee the stability of the closed-loop 
nonlinear system based on the T-S fuzzy 
model, which may also be characterized by 
nonlinear dynamic systems locally. In our 
control design, we adapted the idea of 
control Lyapunov function discussed in [13], 
[14] to design controllers for nonlinear 
systems. Based on a CLF approach, we 
shall derive a sufficient condition to ensure 
the stability of the closed-loop fuzzy system. 
The proposed condition leads to CLF 
nonlinear standpoints that can find a desired 
controller directly and avoid solving 
simultaneous matrix inequality. Moreover, 
for the special case, to construct nonlinear 
fuzzy controller, we also derive a sufficient 
condition to guarantee the stability of the 
closed-loop fuzzy system based on the T-S 
fuzzy model of which the consequent parts 
are linear state dynamic equations. 
II. PRELIMINARIES 
Takagi and Sugeno [1] proposed an 
elegant modeling method, which is often 
 2
If a stabilizing control can be found for 
the system (3), a Lyapunov function for the 
close-loop system is a CLF for the 
open-loop system. Conversely, if a CLF for 
the system (3) is known several formulas 
such as Sontag’s formula [13] and 
Freeman’s formula [11] provide feedback 
control laws that achieve global asymptotic 
stability. 
A. T-S Fuzzy Model with Affine Nonlinear 
Consequences  
Fuzzy controllers for stabilizing the 
fuzzy system (2) can be designed via 
parallel-distributed control (PDC) [2,4]. In 
PDC, fuzzy controllers share the same 
premise parts with (1). Since the consequent 
parts of T-S fuzzy models in (1) are 
described by affine nonlinear dynamic 
equations, the nonlinear control theory is 
used to design the consequent parts of a 
fuzzy controller. In our study, the controller 
for Rule i is

Theorem 2 reveals that if we can find 
a symmetric positive definite matrix P, a 
positive definite matrix R, and a positive 
number ρ  to satisfy (17) or (20), then the 
nonlinear feedback controller  in 
each fuzzy rule can be obtained directly by 
using (18b) and the overall fuzzy controller 
 guarantees that 
the closed-loop system is asymptotically
