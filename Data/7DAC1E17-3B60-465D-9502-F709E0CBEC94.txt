6pipe and an aluminum heat sink; when the maximum heat flux was 285W/cm2, the minimum total
thermal resistance value was 0.225ºC/W. Wang [16] investigated an aluminum heat sink in which were
embedded sets of two and four 6 mm diameter heat pipes, finding that they can carry 36% and 48% of
the total dissipated heat capacity from CPU, and that the total thermal resistance is under 0.24 ºC/W.
Clearly, a heat sink with embedded heat pipes is one of the best solutions to the problem of high heat
generation in electronic components.
The heat sink with six embedded L-type heat pipes studied in this article is shown in Fig.1. The
overall dimensions of the heat sink are 117 x 85 x 83 mm3. One end of the heat pipes is inserted into the
base plate to form the evaporation section, while the other end is embedded in the fins to form the
condensation section. Previous research has only measured the contact, base plate, and total thermal
resistances of heat sinks with embedded heat pipes, and has not addressed the proportion of the total
heat carried away via the L-type heat pipes. This study thus used the superposition method to calculate
the heat carried to the fins through the base plate and embedded L-type heat pipes, in order to find the
ratio of total heat transferred through the L-type heat pipes. These individual thermal resistances of
contact, base plate, base to heat pipes, heat pipes, fins and the total thermal resistance may then be
obtained through thermal resistance analysis and the superposition method.
2. Methodology
2.1 Superposition Method
Figure 2 shows the superposition method of the heat sink with embedded L-type heat pipes,
identical to the setup used in [16]. The solution of linear heat diffusion problems may often be reduced
to the solution of a number of simpler problems by employing this method, which shows that heat
transfer rate Q transfers heat from the heat source to the fins through the base plate and the heat
pipes. The base plate transfers heat to heat sink of second copper block is bQ and the heat pipes
transfer heat to fins is jQ . The symbol j denotes the position of the embedded L-type heat pipes. This
adiabatic condition is similar to be insulated. It means that no heat flow across the adiabatic boundary.
If these six L-type heat pipes have adiabatic and homogeneous condition, there is no heat transferred to
fins. And heating power bQ is borne away by the base plate and heat sink, where the L-type heat
pipes are the adiabatic boundary conditions, and bQ is not transferred upward to the fins because the
8by jQ . fjR is defined as the temperature difference ( cjT minus aT ) divided by jQ . The heat sink
with embedded L-type heat pipes has base plate thermal resistance bR and fin-base convective
resistance nR in the bQ pathway, and base to heat pipe resistance 1hR , heat pipe resistance 1pR
and fin-pipe convective resistance 1fR in the 1Q pathway when j equals 1.
2.2 Experimental Apparatus
The experimental investigation was divided into two parts. The thermal resistance of the heat pipe itself
was measured over a range of input powers, and then the thermal performance of the heat sink assembly was
measured. Each test is described below.
The experimental setup used to measure heat pipe performance is shown in Figure 4. The test article is a
6mm diameter copper water heat pipe with a sintered powder metal wick. The working fluid was water and
the effective pore radius was 10-5 m. The porosity and permeability were 0.5 and 1.3 x 10-12 m2. The heat pipe
was bent at a right angle and had a 51mm evaporator and a 105mm condenser length. The heat source was a
copper block with an embedded electrical resistance heater that was fastened to the heat pipe evaporator. The
heat sink was a second copper block with cooling passages that was attached to the heat pipe condenser. A
circulator was used to pump coolant through the condenser block and regulate its temperature. The resistance
heater was fed by an adjustable DC power supply with integral volt and ammeters that allowed calculation of
input power. An array of 6 type T thermocouples was attached to the heat pipe to monitor evaporator and
condenser temperatures. The entire test set was encased in foam to minimize losses. The heat pipe condenser
section was vertical to simulate its orientation in the heat sink. Power was increased in 2 W increments until
the heat pipe dried out. This allowed measurement of the heat pipe thermal resistance over a range of powers.
The heat sink and its test apparatus are shown in Figure 5. The heat sink consisted of a base plate, 6 heat
pipes, and a fin stack. The fin stack was an array of 28 fins, 0.5mm thick with a 0.4mm gap. The overall stack
dimension is 74 x 76 x 72 mm3. The heat input consisted of a copper block with an embedded resistance
heater. Grease was applied to the mounting surface of the heater block to reduce the interface resistance. A fan
was mounted at the left of heat sink to disperse heat through forced convection to ambient air. Instrumentation
consisted of a type T thermocouple mounted to the upper surface of the dummy heater to measure heater
block temperature; an array of six thermocouples mounted to the center of the lower base plate surface to
measure center temperature; a thermocouple above the fan to measure ambient air temperature; and an array
of five thermocouples on the top of the base plate along a diagonal to measure average plate temperature.

The software program in this paper, coded with Microsoft® Visual BasicTM 6.0, calculates the
thermal performance of a heat sink with embedded L-type heat pipes. These parameters affect its
thermal performance including the dimensions, thermal performance, and position of the embedded
L-type heat pipes. Thus it is very important for the optimum parameters to be selected in order to
enable the best thermal performance of the heat sink. The program contains two main windows. The
first is the selection window, adjusted in the program as the main menu. In this window, the type of the
heat sink with embedded L-type heat pipes can be chosen individually. The second window has five
main tabs. There are four tabs for the input parameters for the thermal module. The first tab contains
the basic parameters of heat pipes including dimensions and thermal performance. The second tab
covers the detailed dimensions of the heat sink. The third and fourth tabs register the basic parameters
of the system, including the input power of the heat source, the thermal grease and solder materials,
and the performance curve of the fan. Once all the input parameters required are entered, the program
may be started. It will analyze the system when the calculate icon is pressed. The fifth tab shows the
simulation results. Acording to the iterative calculation and analog method, the heat capacity jQ
transferred by the embedded L-type heat pipes is found. Based on these calculations, simulations of a
heat sink with embedded heat pipes may be performed.
4. Results and Discussions
Figure 7 shows the thermal resistance/conductance of an L-type heat pipe at different input
power/temperature of heat source. The L-type heat pipe consists of a vacuum-tight container lined with
a wick structure on the inner surface and filled with a working fluid, which exists in both liquid and
vapor states within the container. The working fluid absorbs heat capacity and evaporates from heat
source and condenses into a liquid through fins to complete a thermodynamic cycle. There is a evident
12
force. And this thermal module has higher thermal performace.
A failure mechanism in which the capillary pressure is no longer sufficient to feed the evaporator,
or in other words, the mass flow rate of vapor leaving the evaporator exceeds the mass flow rate of
liquid feeding the evaporator, causing the evaporator to dry out. The evaporator dry out leads to large
and rapid reduction in the ability to transfer heat into the evaporator. This L-type heat pipe is dried out
at below the thermal conductance of 1W/ºC. And from the experimental results and pressure balance
analysis, its relative input heating power is 65W. The thermal conductance is 8.95W/ºC at 25ºC
resulting from measuring value on the figure 7. The high thermal resistance for lower heat loads results
from the lower merit number of water at temperatures lower than its boiling point whereas the high
thermal resistance at higher powers results from compromising the capillary limit. We can derive the
correlation between heating power and L-type heat pipe resistance as shown in Equation (4). From a
heating power of 10 to 50 W, the working fluid within the L-type heat pipe operates efficiently, lowering
the thermal resistance to below 0.3ºC/W. The total thermal resistance reaches a minimum of 0.06 ºC/W
when the heating power is 36 W. This L-type heat pipe is considered to have a possible local dry-out
limit for heat inputs higher than 65 W. The temperature at the evaporation section exceeds 100ºC when
the heating power rises above 65 W. At this point, the L-type heat pipe has burned out and lost its
effectiveness.

Figure 8 shows the relationships of the total thermal resistance tR and thermal contact resistance
cR to the total heating power Q . Surface roughness properties and contact pressure as well as
mechanical and thermal material properties between two contact surfaces can have a significant effect
on the magnitude of thermal contact resistance. Thermal interface materials (high thermal conductivity)
can also have a significant role in lowering thermal contact resistance. The contact thermal resistance is
approximately 0.03ºC/W when the heating power is between 40W and 260W. Therefore, the contact
thermal resistance cR in this experiment may be treated as a constant. This is because that the
thermal conductivity of thermal grease is the same when there is not much change in temperature. The
magnitude of the thermal contact resistance can have a major role in thermal management of electronic
devices and, hence, may significantly affect thermal performance of such thermal module. The
experimental total thermal resistance tR drops from 0.24ºC/W to 0.23ºC/W when the heating power is
14
46.0%, larger than that of the odd-numbered heat-transfer paths (41.2 %) and result from the heat
transfer coefficients of even-numbered heat-transfer paths are larger than that of odd-numbered
heat-transfer paths. These base to heat pipe resistances
hjR , heat pipe resistances pjR , and fin-pipe
convective resistances
fjR are obtained based on Table 1. Tables 2 to 4 show these resistances with total
heating power Q .
hjR is not on the horizontal line with heating power, a result of the thermal performance of the
embedded L-type heat pipes, as shown in Table 2. These six embedded L-type heat pipes distribute the
heat capacity from heat source over the base of the heat sink and transfer to fins resulting in
minimizing the intrinsic temperature drop between them. 1hR drops from 1.43ºC/W to 1.29ºC/W as
heating power rises from 2.7W to 17.7W. When 1Q is 17.7W, it reaches a minimum value of 1.29ºC/W.
2hR drops from 1.63ºC/W to 1.42ºC/W from 3.0W to 19.8W. When 2Q is 19.8W, it reaches a
minimum value of 1.42ºC/W. The heating powers 1Q and 2Q are on the far side of the heat source.
Hence, the dissipative power from total heating power of the heat source is the smallest for among these
six bypass heating paths. 3hR drops from 1.05ºC/W to 0.91ºC/W from 3.8W to 24.6W. When 3Q is
24.6W, it reaches a minimum value of 0.91ºC/W. 4hR drops from 0.99ºC/W to 0.87ºC/W from 4.5W to
29.5W. When 4Q is 29.5W, it reaches a minimum value of 0.87ºC/W. 5hR drops from 0.45ºC/W to
0.37ºC/W from 9.9W to 64.8W. When 5Q is 64.8W, it reaches a minimum value of 0.37ºC/W. 6hR
drops from 0.40ºC/W to 0.34ºC/W from 10.8W to 70.4W. When 6Q is 70.4W, it reaches a minimum
value of 0.34ºC/W. The heating powers 5Q and 6Q are on the position of the heat source. Hence, the
dissipative power from the total heating power of the heat source is the largest among these six bypass
heating paths.
Table 3 shows the relationships of the heat pipe resistances
pjR to the total heating power Q .
1pR drops from 0.41ºC/W to 0.27ºC/W when 1Q is 2.7W to 17.7W. It reaches its minimum value of
0.27ºC/W when 1Q is 17.7W. 2pR drops from 0.36ºC/W to 0.26ºC/W when 2Q is 3.0W to 19.8W. It
reaches its minimum value of 0.26ºC/W when 2Q is 19.8W. 3pR drops from 0.22ºC/W to 0.17ºC/W
when 3Q is between 3.8W and 17.0W. It reaches its minimum value of 0.17ºC/W when 3Q is 17.0W.

produced. A method of solution of the model was developed. Moreover, the total thermal resistance of
the heat sink with six embedded L-type heat pipes is only affected by changes in the base to heat pipes
thermal resistance and heat pipes thermal resistance over the heat flow path of the jQ . That is, the
total thermal resistance varies according to the functionality of the L-type heat pipes. The optimum
total thermal resistance is 0.22ºC/W above an input power of 160W. A comparison of the solution
predictions and the component performance showed good agreement. Finally, the superposition
analytical method for obtaining the thermal performance of the heat sink with embedded L-type heat
pipes is robustly established in the present paper.
