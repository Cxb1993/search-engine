If the decision is “forward,”the intermediate node will overwrite the (Xs, Ys) fields with its own
location coordinates, and appends its IP address and sequence number at the end of the RREQ packet.
It will then broadcast the packet. The process will repeat at each intermediate node until the RREQ
reaches the destination. Upon receiving the RREQ, the destination node will send a route reply (RREP)
packet back to the source along the path indicated by the “path node IP address”and “path node
sequence number”fields. As a result, there is no need for route discovery back to the source node. The
advantage of Q-DIR is that the RREQ is forwarded in the direction toward the destination, i.e., in a
confined broadcast region (strip area) extended from the source to the destination, rather than
unconstrained broadcast as in AODV. As a consequence, the number of RREQ packets can be reduced.
Take Figure 1 as an example. Consider the first scenario where source node S wants to setup a
connection to the destination node D1. Based on the operations of Q-DIR, a path S-T-I-D1 will be
found. As for the other nodes, A, B, O, F and Q, which also receive the RREQ, they will not forward
the RREQ packets. As a result, the RREQ packets are forwarded in the direction from source to
destination and the number of such packets is small.
However, Q-DIR doesn’t always work well. Consider the next scenario where the destination node
is D2. Obviously D2 can be reached through paths S-T-R-G-K-D2 and S-T-I-G-K-D2. However,
neither of them will be discovered by Q-DIR because Q-DIR will not allow cross-quadrant forwarding.
Thus, when nodes I and R receive the RREQ packet sent from T, both of them will find that the
destination node D2 is in the fourth quadrant, whereas they are in the first quadrant of the predecessor
node T. As a result, node I and R will not forward the RREQ packet. This is an important drawback of
Q-DIR. Besides, in order to maintain the relative location between nodes, global information is
required, which will result in a lot of long Hello packets. As a consequence, Q-DIR is not suitable
when the number of nodes is large or the nodes are moving at a high speed.

Figure 6 illustrates the format of RREQ packet employed in the FARNO. The format is an extension of
that used in legacy AODV by appending the IP addresses of the designated forwarding nodes. Of
course, if there is no node in some quadrants, the number of forwarding nodes will be less than four.
The pseudo code for a node to process the received RREQ packet is shown in Figure 7. When a source
node broadcasts an RREQ packet, it designates only the farther nodes in its routing table to forward the
packet. The IP addresses of these nodes are specified in the last rows of the RREQ. Although many
nodes may receive this packet, only U can forward RREQs. Moreover, repetition RREQs would be
neglected (discarded). Before forwarding, a designated node replaces the forwarding IP addresses in
RREQ by those of the farther nodes in its routing table. If the destination node is a neighbor node, the
RREQ is forwarded by unicasting rather than by broadcasting.

6Figure 8. Comparison of Connection setup ratio.
The number of RREQ packets is an indication of the cost for setting up connections because routes
are found by broadcasting RREQ packets. The average numbers of broadcast RREQ packets for the
three algorithms in searching for a destination node are shown in Figure 9. The number corresponding
to AODV is much higher than the others. In particular, it grows rapidly with node density. Because the
RREQs for QDIR are confined to the restricted broadcast region between source and destination, rather
than over the entire area, the number is the least of all. Nevertheless, it also grows with the source-
destination distance. FARNO requires more RREQ packets than QDIR. However, with the increase in
node density, farther nodes can be chosen as forwarding nodes. Consequently, fewer forwarding nodes
are needed and fewer RREQ packets are generated. This feature is different from the other schemes. As
noted before, when the TTL of RREQ is 14, the CSR is improved for FARNO. Moreover, as Figure 9
reveals, only a few extra RREQs are generated compared to the case when TTL is 7.

84 Conclusion and Discussion
With the proposed FARNO routing protocol, a node only has to maintain the information of its
neighbor nodes rather than that of all nodes in the MANET (ad hoc network). This feature makes it
easy to implement. By designating forwarding nodes, FARNO outperforms AODV and Q-DIR in the
comparison of connection setup ratio and RREQ collision.
In this paper, so far, we present the outstanding features of FARNO by selecting“farthest”nodes to
forward RREQs in non-moving scenarios. However, the principle of FARNO is to select a “farther”
node rather than the “farthest”node. In the mobile environment, a farthest node may not be the most
reliable node. For example, it may move out of the transmission range while the routing table is not
updated immediately. Under such circumstances, how to select a reliable farther node in each quadrant
will be investigated in future research.

研究成果自評
本計畫原擬依據電池之老化程度及環境溫度來探討電池之總容量，及其對MANET 之路徑
選擇所造成的影響。然而，在計畫核准之後，經與幾位專家學者討論，認為其理論探討雖
然可行，但因電池種類繁多，且每一批貨的特性仍略有不同，再加上副廠產品相當多，吾
人之研究成果不僅無法達到預期的實用價值，而且也不易發表論文，為國爭光。因此，聽
取學者專家們的建議，在不失相關性的原則下，將題目加以調整，轉而探討「MANET 之
路徑選擇方法」，並可應用至「以電池之剩電量為考量之尋徑協定」。雖然與原題目有所
不容，但還是頗有相關性。計畫執行至今，自認有相當好的成果。目前已將成果整理成論
文的格式(也就是本份報告)，近期即將投稿。
