this method allows large deflection of compliant link. As a result, nonlinear FE method (FEM) has to be 
used. This method, when solved using FEM, lead to excessive shear forces known as shear locking [9] as 
pointed out by Shabana [8]. 
We present here a dynamic model based on the generalization of classical beam theory so that it can 
capture the bending, shear, and axial deformation of a large-deflected compliant mechanism. The classical 
beam theory was originated by Daniel Bernoulli, which assumes that a straight line transverse to the axis 
of the beam before deformation remains straight, inextensible, and normal to the mid-plane after 
deformation. Another important but implicit assumption for classical beam theory is that the deflection 
must be small. Rayleigh [10] latter included the rotatory inertia in the equation of motion. Timoshenko [11] 
further revealed that the effect of rotatory inertia is small for low frequency vibration but at high frequency 
the shear stress deformation is comparable to rotatory inertia.  
In order to characterize the dynamics of a compliant link, a geometrically exact curvature formula is 
necessary. The exact curvature equation that can describe dynamics of a large-deflected link can be found 
in most calculus textbooks:

whereψ is the angle of rotation of the link; and s is the arc length from origin to point (x,y) of the link. 
When the deflection is small, i.e., dy/dx <<1, (1) reduces to (2).

Equation (1) has been used in several papers to formulate the dynamic equations of a link, such as 
Reddy et al. [12] and Monasa et al. [13]. However, as pointed out by Hodges [14], (1) defines the 
curvature along coordinate x, which is on the original undeflected position of the beam. It does not take 
into account the well-known shortening effect due to transverse deflections. This resulting error is often 
unacceptable in many applications when the beam experiences large deflection. In order to overcome this 
problem, we can parameterize x and y by the arc length s. This leads to another curvature equation;  
( )yxyx
ds
d ′′′−′′′=ψ  (3) 
where x=x(s), y=y(s), and the prime denotes derivative with respect to s.  Equation (3) has been used by 
Wagner [15] to derive the dynamics of a large-deflected beam, where the square of (3) is substituted into 
the strain energy function of the beam in deriving the governing equations based on Hamilton’s principle. 
However, the resulting equations are highly coupled and cannot account for shear deformation of the link. 
The difficulty to describe the motion of links undergoing large deflection lies on proper relations 
between angle of rotation ψ and coordinate variables (x, y). This is because the curvature dψ/ds is needed 
to describe the strain energy in addition to the coordinate variables needed to express the kinetic energy. 
Based on the above observations, we develop a geometrically accurate relation between the angle of 
rotation and coordinate variables that can be easily incorporated in the dynamic model of large-deflected 
links. While the previous angle of rotation is defined without considering shear effect (see (1), (2), and (3)), 
this report provides two constraint equations in the derivation of dynamical equations so that angle of 
rotation induced by bending and shear can both be accommodated. Built upon the previous model [16] 
which focuses on the dynamics of a link, in this report we extend the analysis to general mechanisms with 
highly compliant members. In addition, the formulation presented here requires no local coordinates.  
Specifically, this report presents a distributed-parameter dynamic model to predict the dynamics of a 
mechanism with links capable of large deformation, along with a numerical method that uses Newmark 
and vδg2 in (5) since g1 and g2 are identically zero. With With h and v, we have enough independent 
variables (five) for the variational procedure. 
Following the standard procedure of Hamilton’s principle, we first form the total kinetic energy of the 
link as  
[ ]∫ ++= L dsyxAIK 0 22221 )( &&& ρρψ  (6) 
where ρI is moment of inertia of the link;ψ is the angle of rotation induced by bending moment; ρA is mass 
per unit length; and the dot over the variable denotes the time derivative of the variable.  
Similarly, the potential (strain) energy of the beam can also be expressed as  
[ ]∫ ′++′= L dseEAGAEIV 0 22221 )()( γκψ  (7) 
where A is cross-section area and I is the moment of area; E and G are the modulus of elasticity and the 
modulus of shear respectively; κ is the shear correction factor; γ is the shear angle; and e is the axial 
elongation. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd term of (7) represent the strain energy due to bending, shear, and axial 
deformation respectively.  
Equations (6) and (7) express the kinetic and potential energy functions in standard quadratic forms. The 
nonconservative forces applied at the link include a prescribed rotationφ and an external force F at the 
origin Of. Dissipative forces proportional to the angular velocity can also be accommodated. As an 
illustration, we use mass proportional damping model to formulate the virtual work as follows:   
∫ ++−= Lnc dsyyAxxAIW 0 )( δδδψψσδ ρρρ &&&  (8) 
where σ is the damping coefficient.  
The resulting system of partial differential equations that governs the dynamics of the large-deflected 
link can be obtained using standard manipulations of variational calculus [18]. We further introduce 
non-dimensional independent variable ]1,0[/ ∈= Lsu to replace s so that x(s,t) = x(u,t). The equations can 
be written as follows after normalization.

It is clear from (9b,c) that the Lagrange multipliers h and v turn out to be the reaction forces of an 
infinitesimal segment in the +x and +y direction as shown in Fig. 2(b).  The physical interpretations of 
each equation in (13) are stated as follows. 
1. Eq (9a) is the moment balance equation. The rotational inertia in the term is often small, and can be 
neglected in structural applications. Without deformation, this equation can be reduced to the one that 
governs rigid-body rotation. 
2. Eqs. (9b,c) are the results of applying Newton’s 2nd law to each infinitesimal segment directly. 
3. Eqs. (9d,e) are the normalization of (4). They must be solved simultaneously with the rest of (9). 
4. Eq. (9f) is the force balance equation in the deformed axial direction. Without the angle of rotation, it 
reduces to the familiar 2nd order differential equation that governs the axial deformation of a link.

2.2 Spatial approximation 
After temporal discretization, the governing equation reduces to the nonlinear boundary value problem 
represented by (13). Nonlinear finite element method (NFEM) has often been adopted to solve the BVP 
numerically. However, the formulation of NFEM is often complicated. In addition, when using FEM to 
solve problems with shear deformation, there is a numerical problem known as shear locking [9] caused 
by inadmissible interpolation functions. While several procedures have been made to overcome this 
problem, we propose in this section an alternative numerical formulation called shooting method that does 
not suffer from the problem of shear locking.   
The basic idea of shooting method is to treat boundary value problems as initial value problems. 
Consider the following system of n differential equations 
( , )u′ =q f q  (15)
where [0,1]u∈ ; qk(0) is a (n-r)x1 vector of known initial values; qu(0) is a rx1 vector of unknown initial 
values; and qk(1) is a rx1 vector of known terminal values.  In order to integrate (15) as an initial value 
problem, we have to make r guesses for unknown initial values qu(0). The IVP can be integrated 
numerically using MATLAB ODE solver. After obtaining the trajectories of q, the r given terminal values 
qk(1) have to be matched in order for the solution q to be true. Hence the procedure is similar to solving r 
nonlinear algebraic equations except that the explicit forms of the algebraic equations are not known. 
Iterative procedures used for the shooting method can be found in [20~21].  
By setting Tkkkkkk YXVH ],,,,,[ 111111 ++++++ Ψ′Ψ=q , we recast (13a~e) in the form of a nonlinear ODE 
coupled with an algebraic equation (13f). The known initial and terminal values of a vibrating link are 
[ ] [ ]TTkkkk YX 000)0()0()0()0( 111 =Ψ= +++q
[ ] [ ]TTkkkk VH 000)1()1()1()1( 111 =Ψ′= +++q (16) 
Hence we have to make initial guesses for qu(0) to match the given terminal values qk(1). The ODE’s from 
(13a)~(13e) can be integrated by Runge-Kutta methods. Note that (13f) is not a differential equation. 
Hence we cannot incorporate it into the ODE’s. However, we still need to know Γk+1 at each R-K step. 
Since (13f) is true for the entire spatial domain, we can solve it separately at every R-K step j. As shown in 
(17), the values Vk+1, j, Hk+1, j, Ψk+1, j are known at the jth step.

Hence (17) is a nonlinear equation with one variable Γk+1, j. It can be easily solved by bisection method. 
After obtaining the value of Γk+1, j, we can then proceed the next R-K step j+1 from (13) and get the 
valuesVk+1, j+1, Hk+1, j+1, Ψk+1, j+1.  
In summary, the steps for solving the vibrating link problem are outlined as follows.

An experiment has also been conducted to measure the natural frequency of the steel rod whose material 
properties are listed in Table 1. The x direction of the rod is parallel to the direction of gravity so that the 
effect of weight is minimized. As shown in Fig. 7, a proximity sensor (Keyence EZ18T) is placed at the 
undeflected tip position such that it is ON if the tip of the rod approaches and OFF if not. The period of 
vibration can be recorded by adding two adjacent OFF time intervals. The measured period is 
approximated 0.485 second which is very close to that predicted by the previous simulation result (0.49 
second).

4 DYNAMIC ANALYSES OF COMPLIANT MECHANISMS 
The dynamical model for a compliant link presented in Section 1 can be further extended to analyze 
mechanisms with compliant members. Since the dynamic model of the link has already based on inertia 
frame, we can derive the governing equations of links and their associated constraints without introducing 
intermediate or local frames. We present the dynamic formulation of compliant mechanisms in Subsection 
4.1 and illustration examples in Subsection 4.2.  
4.1 Formulation of compliant mechanisms  
Consider a generic compliant mechanism shown in Fig. 8. The n links are connected in series by n+1 
joints where the 0th and (n+1)th joint are ground joints. Each link is governed by six equations from (11). 
They are rewritten as

[ ] 0)sin()cos( =−+−+ iiiiiiiiii AGhv γκγψγψ  (18f) 
where the subscript i is w.r.t. the ith link. Note that no intermediate or local frames are required for each 
link since all of them share the same (inertia) frame x-y. For a mechanism with n links we have 6n 
equations referred to the same inertia frame. These equations are constrained by the n+1 joints connecting 
them. Those constraints can be expressed as algebraic equations that must be valid for all time. We list in 
Table 2 the constraint equations for a joint that connects two links together.  
 
Figure 8 A generic compliant mechanism 
For the 0th joint that connects the 1st link to ground, the constraint equations for three types of connections 
are listed in Table 3. The constraint equations for the nth joint that connects the nth link to ground can be 
formulated similarly.

kept the same. Although the energy profile looks very much the same in Fig. 10, there is a small 
oscillation in the results of both materials when computed by the FEM, as can be seen in a closer view 
shown in Fig. 11. More time steps and mesh size, or different torque profile does not improve the results.

Example II A Four-Bar Mechanism 
We study here the dynamics of a compliant closed-chain mechanism with its initial configuration shown 
in Fig. 12. The coupler (link 2) is made more compliant than the other two links in order to examine the 
effects of large deformation. Detailed parameters of the mechanism are listed in Table 5.

The advantage of the presented energy-based model is that it allows us to easily verify the results by 
energy balance check. Figure 13 shows the calculated energy which must equal to the applied work 
apparently. It is obvious that the total kinetic energy is converted to potential energy at t=0.95s. After the 
potential energy reaches its maximum (and the kinetic energy reaches its minimum), the energy transfers 
back again to the kinetic component.
