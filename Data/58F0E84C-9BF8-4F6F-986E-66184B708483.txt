As shown in Fig. 3, the solar cell modules are connected into parallel structure. The solar cell module system has bypass 
and blocking diodes to prevent from the reverse current due to serial or parallel connection [4][5]. Blocking diodes and 
bypass diodes are arranged to avoid unexpected reverse current path in the parallel structure. Blocking diodes are used to 
avoid the unbalanced sunlight condition for the three solar cell modules. Unbalanced sunlight condition might introduce 
unexpected reverse current path to damage the solar cell module. Bypass diodes are used prevent from the unexpected 
reverse polarity when connecting the three modules. The bypass diodes will bypass the reverse current and will protect the 
solar cell module safely.

2.2 Boost Converter 
 
The circuit representation and schematic diagram of DC/DC boost converter is shown in Fig. 4 [6][7]. The input of boost 
converter is the solar cell module. The output of the boost converter is the battery pack. Four kinds of battery pack are used 
in this paper for comparison. The inductance should be design further which will be discussed later. The control factor for 
the boost converter is defined as the duty of the power MOSFET, D. The boost converter will have the capability to 
regulate the impedance matching between the solar cell module and the battery pack. Maximum power point can be 
guaranteed by using the proposed boost converter [8][9].

The input voltage is the function of the duty. The I solar is also equal to the inductance current LI . 
Lpv II =                                                    (4) 
The power can be calculated as  
pvpvpv IVP =                                              (5) 
Therefore, the power can be rewritten as 
Lbattpv IVDP )1( −=                                  (6) 
It reveals that we can obtain the maximum power point directly from the boost converter stage. If we want to obtain the 
maximum power point, the above equation is very useful for calculation. Both of the two factors D and LI  can be 
controlled.  
In other words, the objective of the maximum power point is to obtain the maximum value of the product term  
LIDK )1( −=                                         (7) 
In order to implement the algorithm into digital microcontroller, K is defined here to be suitable for digital 
implementation. That means if the boost converter is used, the LI  is under high frequency variation dynamically. The 
product term K  should be kept under maximum value dynamically. D  is to be controlled by the dsPIC30F4011 
controller.

In general, when the boost converter is under constant voltage source input and constant output voltage [7], the feedback 
control is required to keep the output voltage constant by closed-loop control.  
However, in this paper, the boost converter is under constant current source input and constant output voltage, the 
feed-forward control is required to keep the maximum power from the input current source instead of feedback the output 
of the boost converter.  
The output voltage is clamped by the battery voltage which can not be varied by the boost converter.

when the nominal value is used, the mathematical principle can be concluded that the 0.1≤= pupupu Kyx . Therefore, the 
derivation can be concluded that the algorithm can be simplified when the maximum value can be obtained. 
 
3.2 Approaching Scheme of Duty-Based Control 
 
The conventional maximum power point regulation have some numerical problem. The initial value can not be determined 
firmly. In addition, the delta-D is ambiguous so that there is no specific method to derive the required D. 
z Step1: initial guess for the control duty 
The initial guess can be determined depending on the DC link voltage or the battery pack voltage.

To keep the rapid numerical convergence for the microcontroller, the duty is selected as follows to approach to the target

4.2 I-V curve and P-V curve 
 
Due to the limit space in our laborotary, the experiment is measured by using xxx lamp instead of sun light. The  I-V 
curve is measured automatically by the microcontroller. The P-V curve also can be calculated. The maximum power point 
can be obtained clearly by comparing the solar cell module power value. As shown in Fig. 9 and 10, the I-V and P-V curve 
are measured. The red curve is measured under 20500 LUX. The green curve is measured under 18500 LUX. The blue 
curve is measured under 12100 LUX. 
As shown in Fig. 9, the three curves are measured under different sunlight strength. The red on is under 20500LUX, the 
green one is under 18540 LUX, and the blue one is under 12100 LUX. Under the same sunlight condition, the I-V curve 
shows decreasing tendency as the voltage increases. 
Fig. 9. The I-V curve for the solar cell module. 
 
If we change the I-V relation into P-V relation as shown in Fig. 10, maximum value can be expected for some specific 
operating point on the P-V curve. The maximum power point is not fixed under different sunlight condition. Therefore, it 
is necessary to determine the maximum power point by using digital controller. 
However, it is usually hard for the digital controller to determine the sunlight strength specifically. Voltage and current 
sensors might be required for the power calculation in the digital controller. In the proposed algorithm in this paper, only 
current sensor is required to calculate output power for the solar cell module. As shown in Fig. 10, the maximum power 
point is different under various sunlight conditions. It is necessary to regulate the appropriate duty to ensure the operating 
under maximum power point.  
 
4.3 Four Testing Cases for Battery Pack 
 
The solar cell module system has four cases for illustration of the proposed algorithm. The voltage level of the battery 
pack is different in the four cases.  
z Case 1: 12V battery pack system 
The optimal duty is 10%. The duty ranges from 10%~90% to keep the ON/OFF switching for the boost converter. Under 
such case )/(1 battpvinitial VVD −= , )12/12(1−=initialD , the ideal duty is 0%. However, the 0% duty can not have ON/OFF 
PWM switching for the boost converter. It can be observed that the optimal power point can not be found under this case. 
The other cases can have maximum power point under different operating voltage.   
z Case 2: 24V battery pack system 
The operating voltage for the battery pack is set to 24V. )/(1 battpvinitial VVD −= , )24/12(1−=initialD , the ideal duty is 
about 0.5. This value can be the initial value for the further calculation in the controller. 
z Case 3: 36V battery pack system 
The operating voltage for the battery pack is set to 36V. )/(1 battpvinitial VVD −= , )36/12(1−=initialD , the ideal duty is 0.67. 
This value can be the initial guess value for the controller to calculate the specific optimal duty. 
z Case 4: 48V battery pack system  
The operating voltage for the battery pack is set to 48V. )/(1 battpvinitial VVD −= , )48/12(1−=initialD , the ideal duty is 
0.75. Similarly, this value can be the initial value for the controller to find the exact optimal solution.

4.5 Sustaining Period Testing for the Solar Fan System 
Finally, the sustaining period is tested. Two cases are illustrated for comparison: Case 1 is without sunlight condition, the 
case 2 is with sunlight condition.  
As shown in Fig. 14, the voltage drop for the battery pack is measured. It is clear that case 2 show slow decreasing rate 
as compared with case 1. The solar energy is proved to help to sustain the battery voltage to prevent from decreasing too 
rapidly.

5.  Conclusion 
 
This paper has successfully developed the hardware implementation for the photo-voltaic solar fan system. The solar fan 
system is used to reduce the indoor temperature. The solar energy is conversed from the original DC level into sinusoidal 
PWM waveform. The Microchip dsPIC controller is used to control the duty of the boost converter and PWM inverter 
drive. Maximum power point regulation can be achieved. The DC/AC inverter is convinced to provide the required power 
for the fan system successfully.
