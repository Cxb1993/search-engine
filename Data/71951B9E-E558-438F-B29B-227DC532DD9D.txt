I. INTRODUCTION 
Optical fiber communication is the most popular 
type of computer communication network.  Fiber is 
the best waveguide in light applications.  It has lots of 
advantages such as low loss, high bandwidth, high 
security, etc. Conventional communication cable is 
short of these advantages.  Optical communication has 
various ways for transmission.  Because of the high 
frequency of light, if we could control and use light as 
the carrier of communication, capacity would be larger 
than conventional communication. 
For optical communication networks, the 
Wavelength Division Multiple Access (WDMA) system 
has been developed at first and maturely 
commercialized.  Today’s WDMA networks achieve 
total throughputs of at most ten Gbps, primarily 
because the use of incoherent optical techniques limits 
their total throughput to the speeds that can be handled 
by electronics technology.  This bottleneck can be 
eliminated by the use of optical switching, 
narrowlinewidth tunable lasers, and coherent detection.  
But its disadvantage is low efficiency in utilizing 
bandwidth for the high bandwidth optical 
communication system due to the guardbands between 
the adjacent channels. 
Thus, the Optical Code Division Multiple Access 
(OCDMA) is developed because it does not need the 
stable, tunable lasers with accurate wavelength control 
that WDMA needs.  This technology is limited to 
Local Area Networks (LANs) since the same broad 
bandwidth that makes OCDMA desirable leads to 
severe problems of dispersion.  At the scale of LAN, 
though, these problems can be easily alleviated with 
Dispersion Compensated Fiber (DCF) [1], but the 
disadvantage of the OCDMA system is the low bit rates 
caused by the low repetition rates of ultrashort pulse 
laser source [2] [3].  
In this paper, we design a Multi-slot OCDMA 
system based on Optical Time Division Multiple 
Access (OTDMA) technology [4].  Before, the 
ultrashort light pulse is spread at the encoder and 
occupies only one slot in the bit duration of each 
OCDMA user.  Now, we try to utilize the remaining 
unused slots and by so doing, data rate of each user can 
be increased with the increased number of slots.  After 
we insert WDMA users, the advantages of these two 
technologies will be combined and it can provide a 
more flexible LANs and high-speed access WANs. 
The performance of OCDMA and hybrid 
OCDMA/WDMA system has been discussed in [5][6].  
Salehi, et al, have obtained the bit error rate (BER) of 
an ultrashort pulse pure ST-CDMA system in which 
there were no WDMA users and the codes were 
modeled as independent, identically distributed random 
variable [5].  Chang has argued that the hybrid scheme 
offers large throughputs and flexible connectivity for a 
large number of users [6].  
The remainder of the paper is organized as 
follows. In Section II, we describe the hybrid 
OCDMA/WDMA system model.  In Section III, we 
propose a structure that is called Multi-slot OCDMA 
system.  The performance analysis is outlined in 
Section IV.  In Section V, we present the BER results.  
Finally, we provide a conclusion in Section VI. 
II. HYBRID OCDMA/WDMA SYSTEMS 
DESCRIPTION 
    The hybrid system scheme is sketched in Fig. 1, in 
which OCDMA is overlaid with WDMA in the same 
spectral region, and the hybrid system model is shown 
in Fig. 2. 
 
Fig. 1 Hybrid OCDMA/WDMA scheme in which OCDMA and 
WDMA channels are overlaid in the same spectral region.  With 
proper code and system designs, crosstalk between the two types 
of channels should be minimal.  Such an overlay may increase 
network capacity above that possible with WDMA alone.

 Note the transmitted spectrum in ST-CDMA is 
selected a priori.  Assume that for ST the transmitted 
spectrum is matched to the ideal bandlimited channel; 
i.e., ( ) ( )A f H f= .  Then the pulse ( )mq t  that results 
from taking the inverse Fourier transform of ( )mq f  in 
equation (3) is of infinite duration and must be 
windowed by some function ( )tw .  In analogy with 
the ideal bandlimited channel ( )H f , we can choose the 
ideal time-limited windows ( ) 1=tw  for 2t T< , and 
( ) 0w t =  elsewhere.  Then the Fourier transform of the 
encoder output ( )ty  is

where ( ) ( )sincw f T Tf=  is the Fourier transform of the 
ideal time-limited window ( )tw .  The intensity of the 
ST modulated pulse varies as ( )sinc cf c f t  and 
consequently, most (approximately 90%) of the energy 
in is contained in the interval [ ]2, 2T T− . 
III. MULTI-SLOT OCDMA SYSTEM 
As mentioned before, the OCDMA is mainly 
used in the transmission of the LANs.  Its data rate is 
limited by the low repetition rate of the ultrashort pulse 
laser source.  Hence, we design a new structure which 
is called the Multi-slot OCDMA system, and it can 
utilize other timeslots efficiently as shown in Fig. 5.  
Here, s slots are used among K slots, and as a result, 
data rate can be improved.  The system structure is 
shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 7  s-slot OCDMA Timing Diagram 
At first, in the transmitter, ultrashort laser pulse is 
divided into s pulses via 1 s×  splitter and sent onto s 
paths.  The pulse on the first path performs E/O 
conversion on bit one, the pulse on the second path 
delays a timeslot T via optical delay line and E/O 
conversion on bit two, and so on.  After E/O 
conversion, all bits turn into optical signals and are 
coupled with the combiner.  The pulse duration of this 
combined signal is spread to sT after the spectral phase 
encoding.  Because the instantaneous peak power 
reduces to 1 s  via splitter, we need a compensator 
which can amplify s times.  We transmit signals via 
star coupler on the optical fiber with other users 
inserted.  
For a unique user, the bits on different slots will 
not interfere with each other even though the same 
codeword is used throughout the bit stream it sends.  
Therefore, these bits can be detected and decoded 
correctly within accurate slots.  Furthermore, MAI is 
an interference produced by other users.  Hence, 
detection device must determine the threshold within 
corresponding slots so that a minimum bit error rate can 
be achieved.

The numbers of Multi-slot OCDMA and WDMA 
users which send ‘1’ in the first bit are denoted as sl  
and n, respectively.  Here sl  and n are both random 
variables with binomial distributions

VI. CONCLUSION 
It has been common knowledge that throughput 
will be increased in OCDMA system with the increase 
of code length, but each user's data rate is limited by the 
low repetition rate of the ultrashort pulse laser source.  
Data rate and total throughput can really be increased 
with the increased number of slots by what we propose 
in this paper, namely, Multi-slot OCDMA system. 
In this paper, we utilize multi-slots to improve 
each OCDMA user's data rate effectively, but the 
throughput can not be unconditionally improved.  
Although data rate can really be increased with the 
increased number of slots, number of users will be 
reduced.  We must establish a standard number which, 
when the number of users in the system exceeds, can 
motivate the use of Multi-slot OCDMA system.  
According to the analysis in Section V, OCDMA users 
with two slots must use a code length of 128, those with 
four slots must use a code length of 256, and those with 
six slots must use a code length of 512. 
Furthermore, in the Multi-slot OCDMA system, 
we insert WDMA users and calculate the number of 
users, data rate, normalized threshold, and total
