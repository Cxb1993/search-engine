1. Introduction 
  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted great interest due to their unique structure and superior physical 
properties [1-3], such as remarkable strength and high thermal and electrical conductivities. Despite their clear 
potential, the applications of CNTs are limited by insufficient availability and difficulties in dispersion controlling. 
Recently, the multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) have reached the commercial production scale; however, the 
MWNTs produced by the large-scale catalytic production method show highly entangled aggregates [4] which make 
the dispersion controlling more difficult. The only effective way, until now, to disperse these MWNTs in water is the 
chemical treatment by refluxing them in concentrated acids [5-9], like sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), or 
these acids’ mixture. Although this approach can highly increase the dispersion property, the length and the π-π 
conjugated structure will be heavily destroyed and distorted due to the vigorous acid attack, resulting in diminished 
physical and mechanical properties. Moreover, the as-prepared MWNTs are always acidic due to the presence of 
residual acids which could hardly be removed which, in turn, would limit their application potentials. The large 
waste of concentrated acids is another environmental problem. Alternate dispersion mechanisms have been used to 
disperse MWNTs in order to avoid the disadvantages encountered while dispersing them with acids. Dispersants, like 
poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS-Na), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(aspartic acid) (PASA), 
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDAC), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and so on [10-14], were used 
which can adsorb onto or wrap around the nanotubes to stabilize them. However, the as-prepared suspension only 
stays good at dilute or fluid dispersion at very low solid content. When the solid content is up to about 1-2 wt%, the 
dilute dispersion turns into concentrated gel with dramatic increasing of viscosity because of the rapidly developed 
entanglement of MWNTs network [15-17], and a dilute dispersion also has limited application potentials. 
 The chemical treatment of MWNTs with H2O2 has been reported [18,19] as a milder condition that can remove the 
amorphous carbon remains in MWNTs but not significantly improve the dispersion efficiency of MWNTs. In this 
work, we propose a new dispersion method that can effectively disperse MWNTs in water. The MWNTs were 
refluxed in H2O2 solution to modify the surface chemistry of MWNTs and then dispersed by using dispersant of 
ammonium polyacrylic acid (PAA-NH4). The H2O2-pretreated MWNTs will have a hydrophilic surface and thus is 
compatible with the polar functional group of PAA-NH4. The effects of H2O2 treatment on the chemical and physical 
properties of MWNTs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transformed 
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The dispersion behaviors of the as-prepared suspension were investigated by 
analyzing the rheology and settling property. Besides, the above results were also compared to dispersions of 
MWNTs treated with a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 with volume ratio of 3:1.  
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Nanotubular morphology 
  To compare the effect of oxidative treatments on the physical and chemical structures of MWNTs, the 
microstructures of pristine, H2O2-treated, and acids-treated MWNTs were examined by TEM micrographs as shown 
in Figs. 1(a)-(b), (c)-(d), and (e)-(f), respectively. Components are labeled in the figures for easy identification. 
Under low magnification (Figs. 1(a), (c) and (e)), nanotubes with high aspect ratio and entanglement are observed for 
all of these MWNTs. It is interesting to observe that there is a significant difference of morphology for the 
acid-treated MWNTs, i.e. most of the nanotubes become a sausage-like structure (Fig. 1(e)). From the detailed 
examination of high-resolution images, the pristine MWNTs are found to have a smooth surface composed of inner 
graphitic layers and outer amorphous layer (Fig. 1(b)). After H2O2 treatment, the amorphous layer diminished, but 
the graphitic layers were retained (Fig. 1(d)) which agrees with the result of literature [18,19] that only amorphous 
carbon can be removed by refluxing in boiled H2O2. On the other hand, for the MWNTs refluxed with mixture of 
acids, the nanotubular surface becomes very rough and abnormal, (Fig. 1(f)). Not only the amorphous layers were 
removed, but also most of graphitic layers become discontinuous and disordered. The open end of nanotubes as 
shown in Fig. 1(f) may be due to the removed catalytic metal. 
 
3.2 Surface chemistry 
Figure 2 displays IR spectra of (a) pristine, (b) H2O2-treated, and (c) acid-treated MWNTs. As reported, the bands 
at 3444 and 1636 cm-1 can be discounted as being due to adsorbed water on the nanotubular surface [15]. This is 
because the high absorbance of nanotubes necessitated a very low sample concentration and therefore there is likely 
to be significant water contamination. After MWNTs were treated by H2O2, additional peaks at 1571 and 1430 cm-1 
are observed (Fig. 2(b)). The peak at 1571 cm-1 was assigned to the aromatic ring vibrations of carbon skeleton 
[15,20], and the peak at 1430 cm-1 might be attributed to the O-H bending deformation of phenolic groups [15]. After 
treatment with concentrated acids, more peaks appeared (Fig. 2(c)). The presence of peaks at 1737 and 1086 cm-1 
indicates the existence of carboxylic group (-COOH) [13]. Besides, the presence of O-H and C=O vibrations at 3444 
and 1636 cm-1 is also an evidence of the existence of –COOH, as have been identified and reported in many other 
literatures [6,21-23], although they were assigned to the contaminated water in Fig. 2(a). Due to our measurement of 
zeta-potentials, we believe the presence of –COOH in Fig. 2(c) is reasonable because the negative-charge density of 
MWNTs at pH ~ 5 increases significantly, from -5.3 mV to -97 mV after treatment with acids, indicating an existence 
of large amount of dissociated group like the -COOH. Note that the increase of negative-charge density can also be 
observed at other pH values higher than 2-3. The peak at 1195 cm-1 was assigned to the C-C stretching. The weak 
peak at 1386 cm-1 can be discounted as being due to traces of nitrate ion that may be formed from the residual HNO3. 
From the above results of increasing intensity of C-C vibrations (1195 cm-1) and the appearance of carboxylic 
group (3444, 1737, 1636 and 1086 cm-1), it is known that the defects of MWNTs significantly increased after acids 
treatment. The presence of –COOH group can facilitate both the wetting and dispersion properties of MWNTs in 
water. The H2O2 has been reported [18,19] as a milder oxidative condition that can create –OH group on the 
nanotubes, which is also found in Fig. 2(b), thus only improvement of wetting property can be observed. Besides, the 
increasing adsorption of aromatic ring vibrations (1571 cm-1) in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) indicates the decreasing size of 
graphitic domains [15]. 
 
3.3 Dispersion property 
Figure 3 shows the settling pictures of 2 wt% aqueous suspensions of (i) pristine MWNTs, (ii) H2O2-treated 
MWNTs with addition of 15 wt% (based upon MWNTs) PAA-NH4 and (iii) acid-treated MWNTs, respectively, 
observed during different time periods of (a) 0 min, (b) 1 min and (c) 3 weeks. The corresponding equilibrium pH 
values of suspensions (i)-(iii) are 9.3, 7.1, and 2.3, respectively. As shown in those pictures, sedimentation is 
significant for the aqueous suspension (i). In less than 1 minute, most of MWNTs precipitate to the bottom and some 
of MWNTs float on the water. This indicates that the pristine MWNTs are very poor to be wetted and dispersed in 
water. For MWNTs treated with mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4, the as-prepared suspension (iii) looks 
dilute and shows highly fluid properties and good dispersion stability. After 3 weeks, the suspension is still 
homogeneous and the sedimentation is hardly observed. This is due to the fact that the hydrophobic graphitic layers 
are destroyed and oxidized by acids, thus making the MWNTs carry many dissociated –COO- on the surface (Fig. 2) 
which can stabilize nanotubes by electrostatic stabilization mechanism [24]. Although the suspension (iii) shows 
good dispersion property, the application is limited due to its acidic nature. To remove the acids contained in the 
MWNTs, we have tried to repeatedly wash the MWNTs with de-ionized water. However, as the filtrate approaches 
pH 2.5, the acid-treated MWNTs become hard to be separated from water which makes the as-prepared suspension 
acidic. It is interesting to note that the critical pH of 2.5 is similar to the pKa of carboxyl group, thus we suppose that 
the hard-separated nanotubes is correlated with the existence of –COOH. It has been known that the –COOH will 
dissociate at pH ≥ pKa and the dissociated –COO- can introduce electrostatic repulsion to disperse nanotubes. As a 
result, the increased dispersion property will inhibit the separation of nanotubes from the suspension. Besides, to 
avoid the negative effect of salt ions on the dispersion stability due to compression of electrical double layer 
thickness, neutralizing the aqueous suspension of acid-treated MWNTs with NaOH is not suggested. For the 
suspension (ii), it is clear to see that the dispersion stability is also good and similar to that of suspension (iii). This 
indicates that the PAA-NH4 is a very efficient dispersant for dispersing H2O2-treated MWNTs in water. Moreover, 
this suspension has additional advantage of neutral pH. 
The above results are also semi-quantified by measuring the transmittance of visible light of 600 nm through 
aqueous suspensions of (i)-(iii). For normalization, we define the initial transmittance at time of 0 minute is 0%,
