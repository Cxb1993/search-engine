films were deposited by various methods, such 
as chemical vapor deposition, reactive 
magnetron sputtering, cathodic arc ion plating 
or hybrid deposition technique [3, 4, 18-25], in 
which a maximum nanohardness of 
approximately 55 GPa at the Si content of 8.9 
at.% was obtained [25]. In these studies [1, 2, 
18-25], the effects of Si content in the 
Ti-Si-C-N coatings on the microstructure, 
mechanical, tribological, and heat resistance 
were concentrated and investigated. In this 
investigation, Ti-Si-C-N films were deposited 
using the cathodic arc plasma evaporation 
process. The effects of the addition of carbon 
content (C2H2 gas) on the synthesis and 
characteristics of quaternary Ti-Si-C-N film 
were investigated. 
2. Experimental Procedure  
Ti-Si-C-N coatings were deposited onto 
silicon wafer and tungsten carbide cermets 
(WC–Co) substrate by a triple target cathodic 
arc evaporation (CAE) system in a single 
process, as shown elsewhere [26]. The 
substrates, after ultrasonically cleaned in 
acetone and methane solutions, were then fixed 
in the substrate holder and subjected to etching 
and preheating in Ar glow discharge plasma. 
Before the deposition process, ion 
bombardment was carried out to further 
remove any contamination on the substrate 
surfaces. The pressure of the Ar gas was kept at 
0.1 Pa. The TiSi (80:20 wt.%) alloy as target 
materials were mounted on opposite sides of 
the chamber walls and a Ti target placed 
between them. The Ti target was used for 
interlayer (Ti/TiN) deposition while TiSi 
targets were used for top layer (TiSiN or 
TiSiCN) deposition. Target current and bias 
voltages were set at 60 A and -150, respectively. 
Nitrogen gas flow is set around 90 sccm. The 
C2H2 gas flow rate was varied from 0 to 196 
sccm during the deposition. Details of the 
deposition process parameters are listed in 
Table 1.  
Surface and fracture morphologies of the 
coatings were observed by a field emission 
scanning electron microscope (SEM: TF-SEM 
JSM7000F). Microstructures of the TiSiCN 
films were observed by field emission scanning 
electron microscopy (FESEM, type: 
JSM7000F), transmission electron microscope 
(TEM, type: JEOL JEM-2100F) and glancing 
angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD). Grain size 
of the films were estimated by Scherrer 
equation utilizing the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of peaks Ti(C,N) (111) of 
GAXRD results [27]. The residual stress of 
as-deposited films were identified by 
glancing-angle X-ray diffraction 
(XRD:PHILIPS PANalytica X'Per PRO MRD) 
which were determined by modified XRD 
sin2Ψ method [28, 29], using a 4-circle 
diffractometer with psi-goniometer geometry. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to 
examine morphology and to measure the extent 
and nature of film roughness. Nanoindentation 
tester (with a Berkovich tip) equipped to AFM 
was employed to determine the nanohardness 
of the films. Raman spectroscopy using a 50 
mW beam of wavelength 514.5 nm emitted 
from an argon laser and a high resolution X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS, type: 
PHI Quantera SXM) using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) 
radiation with a spot size of 100 um were used 
to investigate both spectrum and bonding states 
of the films. HRXPS was utilized to analyze 
film composition and the spectra background 
was subtracted by using the Shirley 
background. The wear property of films was 
investigated using the ball-on-disk tribometer. 
A WC-Co ball with a diameter of 3 mm was 
used as the counter material, with an applied 
load of 1 N and a sliding speed of 42 mm s-1 at 
an ambient temperature of 25oC with a relative 
humidity of 60% RH.  
3. Results and Discussion  
3.1 Spectra characteristics  
Figure 1 shows the Raman spectra of the 
TiSiCN films deposited with various C2H2/N2 
flow rate ratio. As shown in spectrum 1 of Fig. 
1, a 520 cm-1 band from silicon can be 
observed. As illustrated in Fig.1, within the 
wavenumber 900 to 1800 cm-1, spectra from D 
(D means disorder, approximately centered at 
1355 cm-1) and G (G means graphitic, 
approximately centered at 1555 cm-1) bands 
and a very broad asymmetric band between 
2500 and 3100 cm-1 are visible except for the 
TiSiN sample (C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio=0). 
Spectra of all TiSiCN samples(C2H2/N2 flow 
rate ratio=0.5, 1, and 2) present a similar 
 6
of O incorporation and re-sputtering of the 
light Si atoms at the substrate by heavy Ti ions 
with high kinetic energy, as was previously 
reported [18, 24].  
3.2 Microstructure analysis 
Typical FESEM surface morphology of 
the as-deposited TiSiCN films are shown in Fig. 
4 (a) which revealed a lot of macroparticles, 
sizes ranging from sub-micrometer to a few 
micrometers, on the surface. The number and 
size of the particles were increased with 
increasing C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio. Fig. 4 (b) 
demonstrated the cross-sectional images of the 
TiSiCN film utilizing a C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio 
of 0.5 and it revealed a columnar 
microstructure. The Ti/TiN interlayer and 
TiSiCN top layer can be clearly identified. The 
sample deposited with a C2H2/N2 flow rate 
ratio of 1 exposed similar microstructure as Fig. 
4 (b). While samples deposited with C2H2/N2 
flow rate ratio of 0 and 2, the columnar 
microstructure was not clearly present. In all 
samples, the films are compact and exhibit 
good adhesion to the substrate. No obvious 
cracking or porosity was observed.  
Figure 5 (a) and (b) show the AFM 
images of the surface of the TiSiCN films with 
two different C2H2/N2 flow rate ratios of 0 and 
1, respectively. Several asperities were found 
in Fig. 5, which would be the macroparticles 
from the deposition and may influence the 
surface roughness of the films. By comparison 
Fig. 5 (a) and (b), the AFM images indicated 
that the numbers and sizes of particles 
increased with increasing the C2H2/N2 flow 
rate ratio. By comparison Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 5, 
it should be noted that the higher asperity in 
Fig. 5 is due to the higher magnification for Z 
axis than that for X, Y axis in Fig. 5. Figure 6 
shows the surface roughness (Ra) and 
deposition rate as a function of C2H2/N2 flow 
rate ratio. Both surface roughness and 
deposition rates were increased as the C2H2/N2 
flow rate ratio increased. Surface roughness 
and deposition rate were ranging from 110 nm 
to 335 nm and ranging from 20 nm/min to 59 
nm/min, respectively. The increasing 
deposition rate was thought to be due to the 
incorporation of carbon from C2H2 gas. 
Figure 7 shows glancing angle XRD 
patterns of samples deposited by various 
C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio. The pattern of all 
samples revealed the films primarily consists 
of Ti diffraction, which would result from Ti 
interlayer. All patterns consisted of Ti(C,N) 
(111), (200), (220), (311) and(222) peaks 
(JCPDS card, file No. 87-0633 and 89-3828). 
Peak broadening of the TiSiCN samples would 
be caused by ultra fine grain size. Grain sizes 
of samples deposited with C2H2/N2 flow rate 
ratios of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 were 4.3, 4.1, 3.6 and 
3.9 nm, respectively. Due to a TiN interlayer 
beneath the TiSiCN films. The calculated grain 
sizes would be the mixed value from TiN and 
TiSiCN diffractions. In addition, the estimated 
TiN grain size in this study was 9.5 nm. 
Obviously, the Ti(C,N) grain size of TiSiCN 
samples were much finer than those of the TiN 
sample. The GAXRD results were comparable 
to the XPS and the TEM results, the TEM 
analyses will be discussed in the following 
section. 
Figure 8 (a), (b) and (c) show the 
cross-sectional HRTEM micrograph from 
samples with C2H2/N2 flow rate ratios of 0, 1 
and 2, respectively. In Fig. 8 (a) and (b), both 
amorphous phase (marked A) and crystalline 
phase were presented in the films. The selected 
area diffractions (not showed here) by TEM 
proved the crystalline was TiN structure. The 
amorphous phase presented in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) 
would be a-SixNy and a-SixCyNz, phase 
respectively. The HRTEM micrograph of the 
sample deposited with a C2H2/N2 flow rate 
ratio of 0.5 was similar to that of Fig. 8 (b). 
Although Si signal has been detected in Raman 
and XPS spectra as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 
(a) respectively. Silicon crystal was not 
observed in Fig. 8 (a). Figure 8 (c) shows the 
cross-sectional HRTEM micrograph of a 
sample using a C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio of 2, the 
microstructure revealed a amorphous diamond 
like carbon (DLC) phase and could be assigned 
as a-C:(Si,N) phase as have discussed in 
Raman and XPS analysis. 
3.3 Mechanical property 
Figure 9 shows the nanohardness and 
residual stress of TiSiCN films as a function of 
the C2H2/N2 flow rate ratio. The nanohardness 
decreased with the increase of the C2H2/N2
