中文摘要  
生物活性物質的胞內轉運(intracellular transport)是藥物傳輸領域的重要研究項目。
許多生物活性分子如藥物、多肽、蛋白質、寡核苷酸及DNA 等，經常是具有極性
或分子量較大的結構而不易穿過生物膜到達細胞內，因此降低了這些生物活性分子
的治療效能。許多新的研究顯示，富含胍基結構的的胜肽或類似分子可以跨膜傳輸
生物活性大分子。因此本研究之目的希望透過高分子合成反應，得到同時含有具跨
膜傳輸效能的胍基結構及可被細胞內榖胱甘肽還原的雙硫結構之幾丁聚醣(CS)- 精
氨酸(Arg) 共軛結合體， 使其能有良好的跨細胞途徑(transcellular pathway)傳輸能
力。在第一年的計畫中，我們先以幾丁聚醣與2-iminothiolane 反應，得到具有硫醇
結構的CS-TBA 共軛體。再將CS-TBA 與過量的半胱氨(cyteamine，Cya)反應，得到
具有雙硫結構的CS-TBA-Cya共軛體。最後將精氨酸與CS-TBA-Cya 以carbodiimide 
(EDC) 聯結得到具有胍基與雙硫中間體(spacer)結構的幾丁聚醣(CS)-精氨酸(Arg)共
軛結合體(CS-SS-Arg)。反應產物的化學結構以傅立葉轉換紅外光譜分析儀(FTIR)
與核磁共振分析(NMR)分析之。CS-SS-Arg 的雙硫鍵被榖胱甘肽還原為硫醇的效能
及其細胞毒性也於本年度的計畫中一併分析之。在第二年的計畫中，我們先以雷射
掃描共軛焦光譜顯微鏡(CLSM)分析併比較經由螢光染劑fluorescein isothiocyanate 
(FITC)標定之CS、CS-TBA 及CS-SS-Arg 跨膜進入細胞之螢光發光效率。然後我們
分別將CS、CS-TBA 及CS-SS-Arg 與水母綠螢光蛋白(Green Fluoresence Protein，
GFP) DNA組裝得到奈米複合體，並將這些奈米複合體以雷射粒徑分析儀分析其粒
報告內容 (英文版)  
1. Introduction    
       Gene therapy has a tremendous potential 
to provide effective treatments for many 
human diseases including cancer, 
cardiovascular disorders and various inherited 
diseases. However, the success of gene 
therapy can only be realized with safe and 
effective delivery systems. Non-viral delivery 
systems have been sought to overcome the 
safety issues associated with current viral 
vectors including immune response, toxicity, 
chromosomal integration, and short shelf-life 
[1]. Among the non-viral approaches, 
chitosan-based macromolecules are 
particularly attractive because of low 
immunogenicity, versatility in properties and 
types of modifications, unrestricted plasmid 
size, better shelflife and the possibility of 
repeated administration [2]. A major 
limitation of current non-viral systems 
including chitosan derivatives is their inability 
to deliver therapeutic DNA at an efficiency 
that is comparable to viral-based gene carriers 
with acceptable cytotoxicity.  
Arginine (Arg) is a semi-essential or 
conditionally essential amino acid, depending 
on the developmental stage and health status 
of the individual. The positive charged Arg is 
due to the strong basic guanidino group with a 
pKa value of about 12.5, which can provide 
strong capability to condense negatively 
charged DNA. The use of Arg-conjugated 
macromolecules as potential gene carriers 
may also benefit from the fact that 
polyarginine has been shown to enter cells 
more efficiently than other polycationic 
polymers that have been used as gene carriers 
[3]. Arg-rich peptides derived from human 
immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat have 
been reported to easily translocate through 
cell membranes [4]. Arg residues have been 
conjugated to poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) 
dendrimer, poly(propylene imine) (PPI) 
dendrimer, and poly(l-lysine) (PLL) 
dendrimer and they showed greatly enhanced 
transfection efficiency than unmodified 
dendrimers [5]. For the case of linear 
polymers, Arg-modified chitosan and Arg-
based poly(ester-amide)s  also have been 
reported to display high transfection 
efficiency, meaning that these conjugated Arg 
still have an excellent gene delivery potency 
even though they don’t exist as oligo-peptide 
forms. 
Despite the advantages of the membrane 
permeability and nuclear localization ability 
of Arg residues conjugated to macromolecules, 
their applications to human gene therapy still 
were limited because pDNA should efficiently 
release from Arg-conjugates/DNA polyplexes. 
Bioreducible polymers possessing internal 
disulfide bonds have been developed to design 
non-toxic and transfection-efficient polymeric 
gene delivery carriers [6]. Disulfide bonds are 
known to be cleaved by intracellular reducing 
agents such as glutathione, leading to bring 
about the reducing environment-triggered 
release of genetic materials from polyplexes. 
Recently, bioreducible polyamine/imines have 
been developed to show excellent transfection 
efficiency. Additionally, several works to find 
more efficient and optimized bioreducible 
polymeric gene delivery carriers based on 
synthetic polymers and chitosan derivatives 
have been performed.   
In this study,  a novel chitosan derivative 
(CS-SS-Arg) containing the transcellular 
guanidine
 
and intercellular reducable disulfide 
which may be used as an efficient 
adjusted to 6.0 to added sodium acetate buffer. 
CS-TBA dissolved in 1% acetic acid solution 
and added in cysteamine solution dropwise 
over a period 3 hr. the reaction mixture was 
stirred for 24 hr at room temperature. The 
resulting reaction mixture was dialysis against 
aqueous medium at pH 4 and low temperature. 
2.2.3. Synthesis of CS-TBA-Cya-Arg (CS-SS-
Arg) 
CS-TBA-Cya was hydrated in 
demineralized water (1% 1M HCl solution) 
then 1-ethyl-3-(3-
dimethylaminopropyl)cabodiimide 
hydrochloride was added in a final 
concentration of 50 mM in order to activate 
the carboxylic group of Arg moiety. EDC was 
completely dissolved in solution then added 
N-hydroxy succinimide (EDC: NHS, 4:1) 
ratio. The pH was adjusted to 5 of the reaction 
mixture using 1N NaOH solution. Arg was 
added in reaction mixture (1:1). The reaction 
mixture was stirring for 24 hr at room 
temperature. The obtained CS-SS-Arg 
polymer conjugates were purified by dialysis 
against water for 4 days and then freeze-dried. 
2.2.4. NMR and FTIR characterization 
The purified CS-SS-Arg products were 
analyzed by 1H-NMR (Varian Unityionva 500 
NMR Spectrometer, Missouri) and FT-IR 
(Perkin-Elmer Spectrum RX1 FT-IR System, 
Buckinghamshire, England). Degrees of Arg 
substitutions of the synthesized CS-SS-Arg 
polymer conjugates were estimated using 1H-
NMR spectra (20–22). 
2.3 Determination of the thiols group and 
disulfide bond content 
The degree of modification, i.e. the 
amount of free thiol groups immobilized on 
chitosan, was determined photometrically by 
using Ellman’s reagent. 10mg of CS-TBA was 
hydrated in 5 ml of demineralized water. Take 
250µl aliquots of conjugate solution, 250 µl of 
0.5 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and 500µl of 
Ellman’s reagent [6mg of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-
nitrobenzoic acid) dissolved in 20 ml of 0.5 M 
phosphate buffer pH 8.0] were added. The 
reaction was allowed to proceed for 2hr at 
room temperature. Removing the precipitated 
polymer by centrifugation then 300µl of the 
supernatant fluid was transferred to micro-
titration plate. The absorbance was measured 
at a wavelength of 450nm with a micro-
titration plate reader. The amount of free thiol 
groups was calculated from an according 
standard curve obtained by solution with 
distinct concentrations of L-cysteine 
hydrochlorid.  
2.2.4 Measurements of Disulfide contents 
Disulfide content was measured after 
reduction with NaBH4 and addition of 5,5’-
dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described by 
Habeeb. To determine the total amount of 
bound thiol functions 0.5 mg of the conjugates 
was hydrated in 350µl of demineralized water 
and then 650µl of 0.05 m phosphate buffer pH 
6.8 was added. After a swelling process of 30 
min, 1ml of a freshly prepared 4% solution of 
sodium-borohydride was added to the polymer 
suspension. The mixture was then incubated 
for 1 h in an oscillating water bath at 
37±0.5°C. Thereafter, 200 µl of 5m HCl was 
added and the reaction mixture was agitated 
for 10 min in order to destroy the remaining 
sodium-borohydride. The solution was 
neutralized by the addition of 1 µl 1 M 
phosphate buffer pH 8.5 and then 100 µl of 
0.4% (m/v) Ellman’s reagent dissolved in 0.5 
m phosphate buffer pH 8.0 was immediately 
added. After incubation for 1 h at room 
temperature aliquots of 250 µl were 
transferred to a microtitration plate and the 
absorbance was measured at 450nm with a 
refilled with   FBS-containing media until 
analysis at 48 h after transfection. Cells were 
then observed under a fluorescence 
microscope (Carl Zeiss Optical, Chester, VA, 
USA) to monitor any morphological changes 
and to obtain an estimate of the transfection 
efficiency. Cells transfected with 
Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) were used as a positive control and 
those without any treatment were used as a 
negative control. Transfection efficiencies 
were presented by two numeric indicators: 
percentage of cells transfected and gene 
expression level. 
2.7. Percentage of cells transfected 
The percentage of cells transfected was 
quantitatively assessed at 48 h after 
transfection by flow cytometry. Cells were 
detached by 0.05% collagenase. Cell 
suspensions were then transferred to 
microtubes, fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde 
and determined the transfection efficiency by 
a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, 
CA, USA) equipped with a 488 nm Argon 
laser for excitation. For each sample, 10,000 
events were collected and fluorescence was 
detected. Signals were amplified in 
logarithmic mode for fluorescence to 
determine the EGFP-positive events by a 
standard gating technique. The percentage of 
positive events was calculated as the events 
within the gate divided by the total number of 
events, excluding cell debris. 
2.8. Gene expression level 
The gene expression levels of cells were 
assayed by quantifying the expressions of 
EGFP or luciferase. The expression level of 
EGFP was quantified by comparing average 
fluorescence of 1×106 cells. Briefly, cells 
were treated with test NPs encapsulated with 
pEGFP-N2 or naked DNA. After 48 h, cells 
were detached as described. Aliquots of 50 ml were 
transferred to 96-well black plates and the fluorescence 
intensity was analyzed using a multi-detection 
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, 
Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and normalized to the 
total cell number of each sample. For the 
expression of luciferase, cells were plated on 
24-well plates and transfected as previously 
described. The cells transfected were lysed by 
100 ml of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The 
cell lysate was transferred into a 1.5-ml 
microtube, while the cell debris was separated 
by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 5 min). 
Subsequently, a 100 ml of the luciferase assay 
reagent (Promega) was added to a 20 ml of the 
supernatant and the relative luminescence of 
the sample was determined by a microplate 
luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad 
Wildbad, Germany) and normalized to the 
total cell protein concentration by the 
Bradford method. 
2.9. MTT assay 
The cytotoxicity of NPs was evaluated in 
vitro using the MTT assay. HT1080 cells were 
seeded on 24-well plates at 5×104 cells/well, 
allowed to adhere overnight and transfected 
by test NPs containing 1 mg DNA. After 2 h, 
test samples were aspirated and cells were 
incubated for another 46 h. Subsequently, 
cells were incubated in a growth medium 
containing 1 mg/ml MTT reagent for an 
additional 4 h; a 500 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide 
was added to each well to ensure 
solubilization of formazan crystals. Finally, 
the optical density readings were performed 
using a multiwall scanning spectrophotometer 
(Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA, USA) 
at a wavelength of 570 nm. 
2.10. Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis for the determination 
of differences in the measured properties 
between groups was accomplished using one-
way analysis of variance and determination of 
confidence intervals, performed with a 
computer statistical program (Statistical 
homocysteine. Since the concentration of 
these reducing agents is 2–20 µM in plasma, 
which is much lower than that in the 
cytoplasma (~10mM), the disulfide bonds are 
relatively stable in the extracellular 
environment, but readily be degradable in the 
intracellular environment through the efficient 
disulfide-thiol exchange reaction. This feature 
gives the disulfide bond-containing polymers 
the ability to form stable complexes with 
DNA extracellularly and release free genes 
intracellularly to induce efficient gene 
expression, while at the same time, to reduce 
cytotoxicity through polymer degradation. 
The thiolated polymer was prepared by 
modification of chitosan with 2-iminothiolane. 
The modification of chitosan with 2-
iminothiolane can be performed under inert 
condition to avoid the oxidation of thiol 
groups. Amount of covalently attached thiol 
groups on CS–TBA, measured using 
Ellaman’s reagent, was shown in Table 1. The 
thiol content of CS–TBA–Cya becomes 
decreases, indicating the formation of 
disulphide bonds via the oxidation of thiol 
groups respectively on TBA and cysteamine.  
The thiol groups formed by cleaving the 
disulfide crosslinkage were also investigated 
and shown in Table 1. The thiol contents of 
two disulfide-containing chitosan derivatives 
(CS–TBA–Cya and CS–SS–Arg) were 
measured in the presence of 25 mM of either 
dithiothreitol (DTT) or L-glutathione (GSH). 
As anticipated, the reduction of disulfide 
resulted in the increase of thiol concentration. 
Almost 80% of disulfide bonds respectively 
on CS–TBA–Cya or CS–SS–Arg were 
reduced to thiol groups with 25 mM DTT 
within 90 min. With GSH as the reductant, the 
disulfide-to-thiol conversion ratio of CS–SS–
Arg was lower than its DTT reduced 
counterpart.

3.3. Agarose gel electrophoresis  
Agarose gel electrophoresis was 
performed in order to examine DNA 
condensing ability of CS–SS–Arg in the 
absence or presence of DTT. CS–SS–Arg has 
internal disulfide bonds and is expected to be 
degraded in reducing environment such as 
cytoplasm, which contains 0.1–10 mM 
glutathione. DTT is a well-known reducing 
agent. We incubated CS–SS–Arg polyplex in 
2.5~25 mM DTT for 1 h in order to 
investigate the susceptibility to bioreducing 
intracellular environment of CS–SS–Arg 
polyplex. As shown in Fig.2A, CS–SS–Arg 
can retard DNA completely from a weight 
ratio of 5 in the absence of DTT. This result 
shows that CS–SS–Arg can condense DNA 
well via electrostatic interaction between 
positive charged CS–SS–Arg and negative 
charged DNA phosphates. On the other hand, 
DNA released from CS–SS–Arg polyplex was 
observed even at a weight ratio of 10 in the 
presence of 2.5 mM DTT (Fig. 4A). In 
contrast, DNA released in the presence of 
GSH at much higher concentration (25 mM)   
It means that CS–SS–Arg is degraded in 
reducing environment and that it can’t 
condense DNA anymore because of

3.5. Transfection experiments in vitro 
The transfection experiments were 
performed by using GFP reporter gene in HT-
1080 cells. CS were used as controls. 
Polyplexes of CS-TBA-Cya and CS–SS–Arg 
were prepared at weight ratios of 5, 10 and 20. 
To determine the percentage of cells that 
actually expressed the transgene, we counted 
the number of EGFP-positive cells using flow 
cytometry at 48 h post-transfection. As shown 
in Fig. 6, only up to 13% of the cells produced 
EGFP when transfected with the NPs 
incorporated with CS (weight ratio of 10/1 
and 20/1). By incorporating CS–SS–Arg in 
polyplex (weight ratio ratios of 10/1, and 
20/1), a significant increase in the percentage 
of cells that expressed EGFP was found. 
Transfection was increased approximately 
fourfold for the cells transfected with the 
polyplex with an weight ratio ratio of 10/1 
compared to those treated with the polyplex 
incorporated with CS (P <0.05).

shows the viability of cells cultured in the

decreased relatively with. CS–SS–Arg/DNA 
polyplexes were observed to exhibit no 
considerable cytotoxicity in HT-1080 cells 
like CS. This result suggests that CS–SS–Arg 
does not have cytotoxicity and it can be used 
for gene delivery system without 
consideration of cytotoxicity.

4. Conclusion 
  Arginine-grafted bioreducible chitosan-
derivatives was synthesized for non-viral gene 
delivery systems. CS-SS-Arg was able to 
condense pDNA into nano-sized (less than 
200 nm) and positively charged polyplex. It 
was found that CS-SS-Arg was able to release 
pDNA even at a weight ratio of 10 in the 
presence of DTT, meaning that CS-SS-Arg 
can be biodegraded in reducing environment 
such as cytoplasm. The biodegradation of CS-
SS-Arg by reductive cleavage can facilitate 
the efficient release of pDNA from polyplexes 
and reduce its cytotoxicity. As expected, the 
cytotoxicity  of CS-SS-Arg was examined to 
be very low. CS-SS-Arg showed greatly 
enhanced transfection efficiency in 
comparison with unmodified CS in HT-1080 
cells. These result displays that CS-SS-Arg 
can act as an endosome buffer itself and 
supposes the possibility that greatly enhanced 
transfection efficiency of CS-SS-Arg is 
induced by its high cellular penetrating ability 
and may be also mediated by bioreduction 
mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: The use of membrane-
permeable molecules as carrier vectors for the 
intracellular delivery of various bioactive 
macromolecules has gained increased interesting. 
Arginine-rich peptides were reported to possess 
great cell-penetrating ability [1]. Disulfide bonds 
can be cleaved in the cytoplasm since the 
concentration of reducing agents is 2–20 μM in 
plasma, which is much lower than that in the 
cytoplasma (~10 mM). Therefore, in this study, 
investigations on the synthesis of a novel type of 
guanidino-rich macromolecules based on the 
disulfide-linked arginine-chitosan conjugation was 
reported. Nanocomplexes of the disulfide-linked 
arginine-chitosan conjugates with plasmid DNA 
encoding green fluorescenct protein (GFP) were 
characterized for their size, zeta potential, and their 
ability to bind and protect plasmid DNA from 
degradation. The glutathione-dependent DNA 
release from the nanocomplexe was also evaluated. 
 
METHODS: The chitosan–4-thiobutylamidine 
conjugates (CS–TBA) were synthesized by the 
modification of chitosan with 2-iminothiolane. The 
thiol groups on the chitosan–4-thio-butylamidine 
conjugates (CS–TBA) and cysteamine (CYA) were 
oxided to form disulfide spacers and the resulting 
CS–TBA-CYA product was conjugated with 
arginine using EDC/NHS to prepared guanidine- 
and disulfide-riched chitosan derivatives CS-TBA-
CYA-ARG (CS-S-S-ARG). The synthesized 
compound was characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR. 
The CS-S-S-ARG/DNA nanocomplexes was 
prepared at various CS-S-S-ARG to DNA w/w 
ratios. The average sizes of th nanocomplexes were 
examined by using Zetasizer 3000 (Malvern 
Instruments, USA). Agarose gel electrophoresis 
assay of the nanocomplexes was performed using 
Tris-acetate (TAE) buffer with or without adding 
10 µM~3 mM glutathione. DNA was visualized 
with a UV lamp using a Vilber Lourmat imaging 
system. 
RESULTS: CS-S-S-ARG (Fig. 1a); 1HNMR 
(D2O), argenine (NH2CHCH2CH2CH2NH) 
=1.19(2H), argenine (NH2CHCH2CH2CH2NH) = 
1.82, (2H), argenine (NH2CHCH2CH2CH2NH)= 
2.93(2H), argenine (NH2CHCH2CH2CH2NH) 
=3.51-3.58, the value of proton with overlap of 
polymer of chitosan.

173.6(g), 55.5(h), 29.9(i), 24.1(j), 42.5(k), 169(l).  
The particle size decreased with increasing of w/w 
ratios and the average particle size was less than 
200 nm. The zeta potential of the nanocomplexes 
increases with the increase in w/w ratios, and the 
zeta potentials were higher than 32 mV. CS-S-S-
ARG can retard pDNA completely in the absence 
of DTT. In contrast, pDNA released from CS-S-S-
ARG nanocomplex was observed in the presence 
of glutathione (Fig. 1b).

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: Glutathione 
is a well-known reducing agent for disulfide. The 
result suggested that CS-S-S-ARG was degraded in 
reducing environment and pDNA could almost 
completely release from the nanocomplexes 
because of bioreducible cleavage of the disulfide 
bonds in the extended arginine spacer. 
Consequently, it is expected that the CS-S-S-ARG 
nanocomplex may release pDNA by reduction of 
disulfide bonds.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to 
develop a functional hybrid organic-inorganic 
material with a bone-like apatite structure in order 
to accelerate bone formation. The 
tripolyphosphate-functionalized chitosan/gelatin 
composites (TPP-CG) were prepared and directed 
the growth of shape- and size-controllable calcium 
phosphates. By controlling the mineralization 
process, we demonstrate that mineralized calcium 
phosphates of variable sizes and morphologies can 
be observed on the surface and within the matrix of 
the TPP-CG composites. The results of this study 
indicated that the biotemplates mineralized with 
micro- and nano-scaled calcium phosphates with 
structural features close to those of biological 
apatites make them attractive for bone tissue 
engineering applications.

METHODS: Chitosan was blended with gelatin. 
The chitosan-to-gelatin weight ratios in the 
mixtures were 1:1. The hybride films were soaked 
in TPP aqueous solutions (10% w/v) at 4 ℃ for 2 
h, to trigger the TPP-mediated assembly of 
chitosan and gelatin macromolecules into 
biotemplates (TPP-CG biotemplates). Finally, the 
TPP-CG biotemplates were rinsed with deionized 
water at 4 ℃ to remove residual TPP and dried in 
air for 12 h. 
The TPP-CG biotemplates were soaked in freshly 
prepared saturated Ca(OH)2 solution for a period of 
24 hr. After treatment, the templates were 
thoroughly washed with distilled water and then 
soaked in 1.5×SBF solution. The films were 
retrieved after a period of time for soaking. The 
retrieved samples were thoroughly rinsed with 
distilled water and then dried in air. The samples 
were characterized by scanning (SEM) and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) 
analysis to examine the mineralized nanopatites. 
RESULTS: After immersion in 1.5×SBF for 21 
days, the Ca/P molar ratio for the nanocomposite 
was about 1.72, which was apporached to the Ca/P 
molar ratio of HAp (Ca/P = 1.67). The X-ray 
diffraction patterns from these samples exhibit 
several reflections at 2θ = 26° and 32°, which are 
corresponding to those characteristic peaks of 
HAp. EDX analysis and X-ray diffraction clearly 
showed that the mineral phase deposited in the 
matrix of the template should be constituted of 
HAp-like materials [1]. SEM investigation of 
mineral deposition on the templates showed many 
micro-scaled spherical aggregates (Fig. 1A) in 
contrast to some nano-scaled, worm-like 
nanocrystals deposited on the Ca(OH)2 treated 
templates (Fig. 1B). HAp nanocrystals grown in 
the matrix (~50 nm) are much less than the 
spherical aggregates (5~20 μm) deposited on the 
surface (Fig. 1C and 1D).

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 
we have demonstrated the TPP-mediated 
supramolecular assembly of chitosan-gelatin 
biotemplates (TPP-CG biotemplates). The 
templates possess the ability to mineralize various 
calcium phosphates. The size, shape and Ca/P 
molar ratio of the calcium phosphates deposited on 
the surface and grown in the matrix of the 
templates could be controlled.
