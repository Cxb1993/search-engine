2006; Sloan, 1988; Xue et al., 1997; Yu and Hossain, 1998) or the upper bounds ( e.g. 
Cavicchi and Gambarotta, 2006; da Silva and Antão, 2008; Kim and Huh, 2006; 
Krabbenhoft et al., 2005; Li and Yu, 2006; Lyaminz and Sloan, 2002b; 
Makrodimopoulos and Martin, 2008; Sloan, 1989; Sloan and Kleeman, 1995; Yan and 
Nguyen-Dang, 2001; Zhang, 1995). Namely, purely static and purely kinematic 
optimization variables are considered separately. Hwee et al. (1984) pointed out that 
this leads to a repetition of some task if trying to set the lower and the upper bounds to 
a real solution. In addition, it finds difficulties to further enhance the corresponding 
computing accuracy and efficiency (Vu et al., 2004a) without numerically exploiting 
the duality relationship between the lower bound and the upper bound formulations. 
As illustrated (Leu, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2009a, 2009b; Leu 
and Chen, 2006; Leu et al., 2009), a general plasticity problem naturally leads to the 
lower bound formulation. Namely, we state the primal problem in the form of the 
lower bound formulation seeking the maximum solution under constraints of static 
and constitutive admissibility. The duality relationship between the static and the 
kinematic formulations can be stated theoretically by duality theorems (e.g. Yang, 
1991b) and illustrated analytically for typical problems (e.g. Leu, 2009a; Leu et al., 
2009). By a generalized Hölder inequality (Yang, 1991b) we can transform the lower 
bound formulation to the upper bound formulation. Based on the previous work (Huh 
and Yang, 1991; Yang, 1993), the author has contributed to kinematic limit analysis 
and kinematic shakedown analysis by extending the capability and performance of the 
combined smoothing and successive approximation (CSSA) algorithm (Yang, 1982) 
based on the duality theorem (e.g. Yang, 1991b). Moreover, the author has performed 
the convergence analysis of the CSSA algorithm (Leu, 2003, 2005, 2007) by using the 
Hölder inequality (Goffman and Pedrick, 1965). In addition, quantitative comparisons 
with elasto-plastic analysis have been made recently (Kim and Huh, 2006) showing 
that only a fraction of the cost of elasto-plastic analysis was spent by sequential limit 
analysis based on the CSSA algorithm. 
The duality relationship can be further applied to improve the numerical 
investigation of limit and shakedown analysis. Actually, the primal-dual optimal 
problems receive much attention and have been one of the central topics in 
mathematical programming (e.g. Chan et al., 1999; Liu and Sun, 2004; Williamson, 
2002). It not only calculates the upper bound and the lower bound simultaneously but 
also converges rapidly to the primal-dual optimal solution. However, limit and 
shakedown analysis seldom utilize the duality between the upper bound and the lower 
bound formulations in numerical aspects Vu et al. (2004a). In plasticity problems, 
Hwee et al. (1984) proposed a combined upper and lower bound analysis to calculate 
the values of kinematic and static variables together with the true collapse load for

2. Problem formulation 
The project is to develop an efficient and robust primal-dual algorithm for limit 
and shakedown analysis by combining the advantages of both the purely kinematic 
and the purely static approaches. The primal-dual optimal solution is primal feasible, 
dual feasible and with no duality gap. We will develop the primal-dual algorithm 
based on the CSSA algorithm (Yang, 1982) to solve the primal-dual optimality 
conditions. The CSSA algorithm has been made necessary modified to provide a 
direct-method framework for kinematic limit and shakedown analysis. 
The first-year project results are still in preparation for publications. The 
following sections are to simply illustrate the research principles and methods in the 
project. The formulation demonstrated is the anticipated task in the first phase 
involving the von Mises materials. For simplicity, we will focus on the formulation of 
static and kinematic limit analysis. Particularly, the duality between the static and 
kinematic limit analysis is also demonstrated theoretically and the equality relation 
between the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound was confirmed 
analytically by a typical problem. 
2.1 Static and kinematic limit analysis 
In limit analysis, the duality relationship between the static and kinematic 
theorem have been widely shown (e.g. Morelle, 1991). The problem statement 
naturally leads to the static (or lower bound) formulation. The corresponding 
kinematic (or upper bound) formulation can be stated by duality theorems (Yang, 
1981, 1987, 1991a, 1993). As shown by Yang (1981, 1987, 1991a, 1993), Huh and 
Yang (1991), the duality theorem theoretically equates the greatest lower bound to the 
least upper bound. 
For the sake of completeness, we first illustrate briefly in the following about the 
static formulation and kinematic formulation corresponding to a general plasticity 
problem. Second, we extend the successful experience to the formulation of kinematic 
shakedown analysis. 
2.1. Static limit analysis 
We consider a general plane strain problem with the domain D  consisting of the 
static boundary Ds∂  and the kinematic boundary Dk∂  (Yang, 1991a). Based on the 
concept of limit analysis, the quasi-static problem is to seek the maximum allowable 
driving load under constraints of static and constitutive admissibility such that 
maximize   ( )σq  
subject to   0=⋅∇ σ               in  D        (1) 
tqn
vv =⋅σ              on Ds∂         
0v σσ ≤              in D  
 6
associated with the von Mises yield criterion (Hill, 1950). For the axis-symmetric 
plane strain cylinder problem, we have 
σσσσ θ =−= )(2
3
v r
             (5) 
εεε θ &&& ==− 3
2
v           (6) 
Combining Eqs. (3) and (4), we have 
dStuq
sD
vv ⋅∫∂ = dAD εσ &:∫ ≤ dAD vv −∫ εσ & ≤ dAD v0 −∫ εσ &      (7) 
Since uv  appears homogeneously and linearly in Inequality (7), we can 
normalize the relationship by setting the following normalization 
1=⋅∫∂ dStusD vv          (8) 
which is to be treated as one of constraints. 
Accordingly, ( )σq  can be bounded above by ( )uq v  as 
( )σq = dA
D
εσ &:∫ ≤ dAD vv −∫ εσ & ≤ dAD v0 −∫ εσ & ( )uq v=            (9) 
Thus, the upper bound formulation is stated in the form of a constrained minimization 
problem as 
minimize  ( )uq v  
subject to ( )uq v = dA
D v
0 −∫ εσ &                (10) 
1=⋅∫∂ dStusD vv      on Ds∂  
0=⋅∇ uv        in D  
kinematic boundary conditions on Dk∂  
where 0=⋅∇ uv  is the incompressibility constraint inherent in the von Mises yield 
criterion (Hill, 1950). Therefore, the upper bound formulation seeks the least upper 
bound for each step on kinematically admissible solutions. 
2.3. Exact limit solution 
The primal–dual problems (1) and (10) are convex programming problems (Huh 
and Yang, 1991; Yanh, 1993). Thus, there exist a unique maximum and minimum to 
problems (1) and (10), respectively. Accordingly, the extreme values of the lower 
bound functional ( )σq  and its corresponding upper bound functional ( )uq v  are 
equal to the unique, exact solution ∗q  for each step in a process. Namely 
maximize ( )σq ∗= q =minimize ( )uq v           (11) 
 8
functional is smoothed by a small real number δ  to overcome the numerical 
difficulty resulting from non-smoothness over some rigid regions as detailed by Huh 
and Yang (1991). Reorganizing the nonlinear equations, linear matrix-vector 
equations are then produced as 
[ ] { } { }TUK λ=               (14) 
{ } { } 01=−TU t                (15) 
with [ ] { }=UK ∑

β [ ] { } 12 +je UK         (16) 
where the subscriptions j , )1( +j  indicate quantities corresponding to any 
successive iterations. 
Combining Eqs. (14) and (15), we express λ , }{U  as follows 
{ } [ ] { }TKT t 1
1
−=λ                          (17) 
{ } [ ] { }TKU 1−= λ               (18) 
where [ ] 1−K  is the inverse of [ ]K . 
Computationally, an inner and outer iterative sequence is conducted to solve the 
minimization problem. From one outer iteration to the next, the smoothing parameter 
δ  used in the inner iteration is allowed to decrease and then convergence to zero 
finally (Leu and Chen, 2006). 
 
3. The primal-dual algorithm for limit analysis 
Note that, Tran et al. (2009) and Vu et al. (2004a, 2004b, 2007) utilized a 
Newton and Newton-like iterations, respectively, to calculate simultaneously both the 
upper and lower bounds for limit and shakedown analysis. However, it is mentioned 
by Vu et al. (2004a) that Newton method was not applied effectively in shakedown 
analysis though it has shown high competence in limit analysis. 
In the project, we will derive a primal-dual algorithm based on the CSSA 
algorithm for limit and shakedown analysis. The primal-dual algorithm basically 
consists of the procedures to solve the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality 
conditions of the Lagrangian Eq. (13). After some manipulation, we will calculate 
primal-dual optimal solution of primal feasibility, dual feasibility and no duality gap. 
As shown, Eq. (13) is the corresponding Lagrangian of Eq. (12). Note that, the 
penalty method mixed with the Lagrangian multiplier method (Reddy, 1986) is 
utilized to transform the constrained optimization problem into the corresponding 
 10
algorithm not only calculates the upper bound and the lower bound simultaneously 
but also converges rapidly to the primal-dual optimal solution with no duality gap. 
3) Practically, limit and shakedown analysis are required for design checks by the 
new European standard. Accordingly, the primal-dual CSSA-based algorithm is to 
contribute to national developments by providing a powerful tool for structural design 
and safety assessment considering monotonic loading cases or variable repeated 
actions. The sustainable development will benefit from the reliable and effective 
design and safety evaluation of engineering structures. 
4) The project is to develop a direct-method finite-element computer code for 
primal-dual limit and kinematic shakedown analysis. Contrary to the step-by-step 
inelastic analysis provided by some commercial codes, e.g. ABAQUS, the direct 
method is more comparable in terms of computing efficiency and acceptable accuracy 
without requirement of the full time-history loading information. 
5) The three-year ranged project is to contribute to the advancement of 
computational plasticity by developing a primal-dual CSSA-based algorithm for limit 
and shakedown analysis. Its capability and performance are to be compared with those 
of primal-dual algorithms based on Newton method in the literature. The author will 
fully focus on the researches of the proposed project in the future. The results of the 
proposed project are to publish in some top-ranked international journals such as 
Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, Computer Methods in Applied 
Mechanics and Engineering, International Journal for Numerical Methods in 
Engineering, International Journal of Solids and Structures etc.
