ABSTRACT 
The region-matching technique with moment 
method is implemented cleverly to derive a rigorous 
series solution to the scattering problem of a crescent 
alluvial valley under plane SH-wave incidence. The 
displacement fields within the alluvial layer and 
half-plane are expressed as a superposition of 
appropriate wavefunctions. Suitable Graf’s addition 
formulas facilitate the enforcement of matching 
conditions on the interface for determining unknown 
coefficients. To overcome the difficulty in applying 
addition formulas, and to check the derived series 
solution, the point collocation method is utilized also. 
Effects of some parameters on steady-state and 
transient ground motions are discussed. The cases of 
a semi-circular unfilled canyon, a semi-circular 
alluvial valley and a circular-arc empty canyon are 
all special cases of the present case. The proposed 
approach is very promising and can be directly 
applied to attacking more general problems for 
partially filled cases.  
 
Key words: SH waves, scattering, alluvial valley 
 
 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Noticeable effects of geological and topographical 
local conditions on ground motions during 
earthquakes are largely recognized at the present day. 
Better understanding of the mechanism of these 
effects provides crucial information for earthquake 
hazard assessment and microzonation as well as the 
design of earthquake resistant structures. Since 
1970s, there have been many studies concerning the 
possible modification of site responses elicited by 
dynamic sources in the half-plane. The most widely 
used include the finite difference method (FDM) 
(e.g., Boore 1972), the finite element method (FEM) 
(e.g., Lysmer & Drake 1972; Smith 1975; Bielak et 
al. 1999), and the boundary element method (BEM) 
(e.g., Papageorgiou & Kim 1991; Sánchez-Sesma et 
al. 1993; Fishman & Ahmad 1995; Luzón et al. 
2004). Furthermore, the BEM can be coupled with 
the FEM (e.g., Bielak et al. 1991) or the discrete 
wavenumber method (e.g., Kawase & Aki 1989; 
Bouchon et al. 1989; Gil-Zepeda et al. 2003). 
Nowadays, solving complicated problem appears to 
be an effortless task for numerical approaches. 
However, their reliability relies on how well the 
confidence level is guaranteed in comparison with 
canonical solutions. Consequently, if using 
analytical methods is possible, it is still worth 
pursuing good benchmark examples and 
corresponding solutions. 
A crescent alluvial valley is a kind of ‘more 
realistic’ alluvial valley. Its cross-section shape is 
very similar to that of the Nera River alluvial valley 
in Italy (see geological section CC’ in fig. 3 of Lenti 
et al. 2009). Indeed, this type of cross-section shape 
has caught our eyes. Although such a shape looks 
very simple, its boundary-value problem for the 
wave equation cannot be solved directly by using the 
method of separation of variables because of the 
nature of shape involving two individual circular-arc 
boundaries. So far, to the authors’ knowledge, the 
series solution to the SH-wave scattering problem by 
a crescent alluvial valley has not appeared yet in the 
literature. Thus, carrying out the derivation of such a 
solution via the region-matching technique is the 
authors’ aim in this report. The series solution 
derived here not only redeems the regret for the lack 
of exact solution, but also provides better physical 
insights into the problem.

respectively. They not only satisfy the Helmholtz 
equation, but also are complete sets of radial 
eigenfunctions expanded for a circular boundary (see 
e.g. Mow & Pao 1971; Lee & Trifunac 1979). After 
satisfying the traction-free boundary condition on 
the top surface of the deposit (eq. 3), the expressions 
of 1 2( )W kr  and 2 2( )W kr  can be obtained.  
Next, the core of the solution technique lies in the 
use of Graf’s addition formula given by Watson 
(1958), that is,

where ( )nJ ⋅  denotes the nth order Bessel function of 
the first kind, and the geometrical relations between 
the parameters ϖ , Z , z , ψ  and φ  can be seen in 
Watson (1958). 
In order to meet the continuity conditions on the 
contact interface between the half-space and the 
alluvium, the cylindrical coordinate system in eq. (1) 
must be shifted from 2 2( ,  )r θ  to 1 1( ,  )r θ . For this 
purpose, eq. (2) has to be rewritten in a suitable form. 
According to the nature of Graf’s addition formulas, 
the cases of crescent alluvial valleys are classified 
into two groups, that is, those of a e>  and a e< . 
The latter cases are left out for simplified version of 
this report. 
For the cases of a e> , applying the orthogonal 
properties of sine and cosine functions to the stress 
continuity condition (eq. 5), and integrating over the 
range [ / 2,  / 2]π π−  lead to the following 
relationships between unknown coefficients in

After truncating the infinite series properly, the 
unknown coefficients nC  and nD  may be solved 
respectively by standard matrix techniques. Once the

3.1 FREQUENCY-DOMAIN RESPONSES 
In order to demonstrate the effect of dimensionless 
alluvium thickness on the surface displacement 
amplitudes, Fig. 2(a) gives the results for 
/ 0.25h a = , 0.5 and 0.75 with 2.0η =  at horizontal 
incidence ( 90α = D ). One can find that, in the valley 
region ( / 1.0x a ≤ ), the variability of ground 
motions is very chaotic. Near the right- and left-hand 
corners of the valley, the local maxima of 
displacement amplitudes increase with increasing 
/h a .  
Fig. 2(b) shows the influence of canyon depth on 
ground surface motions. As seen in Fig. 2(b), the 
peak amplitudes occur mostly in the vicinity of 
/ 1.0x a = − , and they decrease with decreasing 
/d a . The surface motions to the left of the canyon 
are more oscillatory and complicated than those to 
the right. This may be attributed to the interference 
between the incident, reflected and scattered waves 
in the illumination zone ( / 1.0x a < ) and to the 
shielding effect in the shadow zone ( / 1.0x a > ). 
For the shake of giving a clearer idea of changes in 
surface motions, Fig. 3 illustrate the displacement 
amplitudes as a function of the dimensionless 
distance /x a  and the dimensionless frequency η  at 
horizontal incidence ( 90α = D ). Fig. 3(a) 
corresponds to the case of a crescent alluvial valley 
with / 0.25h a = , while Fig. 3(b) is for the case of a 
circular-arc canyon with / 0.75d a = . Fig. 3 gives a 
good portrait of frequency behavior of surface 
ground motions. From Fig. 3(a), the resonant 
behavior is sometimes clear when several peaks are 
distributed in space for a given frequency. From Fig. 
3(b), the amplification of displacement amplitudes 
usually takes place on the left-hand canyon face. The 
surface amplification shown in Fig. 3(a) is quite high 
in comparison with Fig. 3(b).  
 
3.2 TIME-DOMAIN RESPONSES 
In this subsection, the model response in the time 
domain is obtained from the frequency-domain 
solution by using fast Fourier transform technique. 
The incident signal, a symmetric Ricker wavelet (e.g. 
Kawase 1988), is taken. 
Two synthetic seismograms at oblique ( 30α = D ) 
incidence for the filling ( / 0.25h a = ) and empty 
( / 0.7d a = ) cases are plotted in Figs 4(a) and (b), 
respectively. They contain 121 time-series received 
from equally spaced stations located along the 
ground surface between / 4.0x a = −  and 6.0. 
Parameters used are set as follows: the maximum 
valley (or canyon) width is 1 km, the shear wave

5, one can find that the combined geological and 
geometrical focusing effect may be the primary 
contributor to high amplitude of wave motion. From 
Fig. 6, the nature of diffraction can be seen clearly.  
 
4 CONCLUSION 
A novel series solution to the scattering problem of a 
crescent alluvial valley impinged upon by incident 
plane SH waves has been derived successfully. The 
solution method was based on the region-matching 
technique, cooperating with the moment method and 
appropriate Graf’s addition formulas, and the point 
collocation method combined with coordinate 
transformation relations was employed too to fill the 
gap in using Graf’s addition formulas. The derived 
series solution not only can cover unfilled cases (i.e. 
those for a circular-arc canyon), but also can 
degenerate into well-known exact solutions for a 
semi-circular vacant canyon and a semi-circular 
alluvial valley. The proposed results are intrinsically 
important because they not only enrich the list of 
geometries of alluvial valleys, but also provide 
challenging criteria for the validation of other 
frequency- and time-domain codes. Besides, the 
solution technique presented herein opens a new 
opportunity to other types of alluvial valleys and 
vacant canyons.  
 
SELF ASSESSMENT 
The content of this report has completely conformed 
to the goals of the original project. The construction 
of the rigorous series solution to the desired problem 
and the associated evaluation of spacial and temporal 
variations in surface motions have been 
accomplished. In addition to the achievement shown 
in this report, further extensions of the present model 
(see Fig. 7) have been made also, but corresponding 
results are not shown here for conciseness. In sum, 
the fruitful results of this report are new and could be 
submitted to international journals with high quality 
for publication.
