Abstract
The effects of a grown SiO2 layer on the Si substrate and the CuO additive in GeO2 powders
on the enhanced growth of Ge-Si1-xGexOy and GeO2-Si1-xGexOy core-shell nanowires (hereafter
referred as Ge-Si1-xGexOy and GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs, respectively), and Si1-xGexOy nanowire
(SiGeONW) assemblies via the carbothermal reduction of GeO2 powders at 1050-1100 C˚ in 
flowing Ar were studied. Without adding CuO into GeO2 powders only Ge-Si1-xGexOy NWs were
grown on the SiO2/Si substrate, while no NWs could be grown on the Si substrate. Adding CuO
into GeO2 powders enhanced the growth of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy and Ge-Si1-xGexOy NWs and
SiGeONWs on the Si substrate as well as that of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs on the SiO2/Si substrate.
The growth of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy and Ge-Si1-xGexOy NWs follows the vapor-solid process. The
cord-, chain-, and tube-like morphologies of SiGeONWs were observed. The growth of various
SiGeONWs assemblies follows the vapor-liquid-solid process. The morphology of SiGeONWs
assemblies is not temperature-controlled but dependent on the Cu concentration and the size of
CuSiGe catalysts. The present studies reveal that the oxidation of the Si substrate plays an
important role in enhancing the growth of Ge-Si1-xGexOy and GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs and
SiGeONWs.

1. Introduction
Recently, Ge and GeO2 nanowires (NWs) have attracted much attention for applications in
one-dimensional nanodevices [1-13]. Ge has significantly higher electron and hole mobilities
than Si. Furthermore, the excitonic Bohr radius of Ge is larger than that of Si, resulting in more
prominent quantum confinement effects in Ge NWs [14]. GeO2 is one of the promising materials
for optical devices because it has better properties than SiO2 in certain aspects. In addition, GeO2
nanocrystals show a blue photoluminescence with peak energies around 2.2 and 3.1 eV [15].
However, Ge is sensitive to oxidation and thus suffers from the water corrosion of GeO2 in air
[16,17]. Passivation of the surface of Ge or GeO2 NWs is one of the important processes for
realizing a high-performance device.
So far, only few studies about the fabrication of Ge-carbon [1,2], Ge-SiO2 [3-5], and
Ge-GeO2 core-shell NWs (hereafter referred as NWs) [6] have been reported. Carbothermal
reduction has been used as a simple and cheap method to fabricate the nanomaterials. It was
reported that luminescent Ge nanocrystals can precipitate in the sputtered Si1-xGexO2 films after
annealing in a reduced ambient of H2 [18-20]. The reduction of Si1-xGexO2 is conceivable with
other species such as CO [20]. Thus, upon the carbothermal reduction of GeO2 powders Ge NWs
could be grown under a certain condition.
SiO2 NWs (SiONWs) and GeO2 NWs (GeONWs) have attracted significant research attention
due to their promising properties such as intense blue light emission at room temperature [15,21].
The optical properties of SiONWs may be improved by Ge-doping because GeO2 is more
refractive than SiO2. Ge+-doped SiO2 films and Si1-xGexO2 NWs (SiGeONWs) have shown a blue
shift of their photoluminescence peaks [22,23]. As yet, only the Au-catalyzed growth of
SiGeONWs from a Si1-xGex film is reported [23]. Recently, Ga [24-26], Sn [27,28], and
result that no Ge-Si1-xGexOy NWs were formed on the Si substrate via the carbothermal reduction
of GeO2 powders is consistent with the previous reports that during hydrogen annealing no Ge
precipitation occurs in the unoxidized GeSi layer [20], and the formation of Ge nanocrystals is
stimulated by high oxygen content in the Si1-xGexOy alloy [31].
Upon the carbothermal reduction of CuO-doped GeO2 powders at 1100˚C, significant NWs 
were also grown on the Si substrates as shown in Fig. 4, which are more numerous than that
shown in Fig. 1. This result reveals that the CuO additive in the GeO2 powders can significantly
enhance the growth of NWs on a Si substrate. From the XRD paterns in Fig. 5, at 1050˚C the 
NWs are of GeO2 and Ge phases, with the former being dominant, while at 1100˚C only the Ge 
phase is present. These NWs show GeO2-Si1-xGexOy and Ge-Si1-xGexOy core-shell structures,
respectively. One example of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6(b) the contrast
of part of the GeO2 core disappears, because it underwent amorphization within seconds upon
electron-beam irradiation during TEM observation.
The growth of Ge-Si1-xGexOy and GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWS on the Si substrate initiates from the
nanoparticles, and also follows the VS process because no globules have been observed at the
tips of NWs. It is supposed that CO2, generated from the carbothermal reduction of CuO powders,
reacts with the Si substrate to form SiO(g). Then the SiO(g) reacts with the GeO(g), generated
from the carbothermal reduction of GeO2 powders, to form Si1-xGexOy, which subsequently
embodies the formation of GeO2 nanocrystals via reaction (1) GeO + CO2 GeO2 + CO. On the
other hand, Ge nanocrystals can precipitate via reaction (2) GeO2 + 2CO  Ge + 2CO2 and
reaction (3) GeO2 + Si Ge + SiO2. In reaction (3) Si atoms are from the Si substrate.
At 1050˚C reaction (1) is dominant, forming GeO2, while at 1100˚C reactions (2) and (3) 
become dominant, forming Ge. As GeO(g) and SiO(g) continue to dissolve into the amorphous
Si1-xGexOy, GeO2 or Ge separates out continuously to form the core surrounded by the remaining
Si1-xGexOy, forming GeO2-Si1-xGexOy and Ge-Si1-xGexOy NWs at 1050 and 1100˚C, respectively. 
On the SiO2/Si substrate, however, only GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs can be grown at a temperature of
1050-1100˚C. It seems that the SiO2 layer, about 500 nm thick, is thick enough to retard the
diffusion of Si atoms from the Si substrate to the NWs, and thus suppress reaction (3), whilst
reaction (2) is minor. As a consequence, reaction (1) becomes dominant even at 1100˚C, alowing 
only the growth of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy NWs on the SiO2/Si substrate.
3-2 Growth of SiGeONWs
The SiGeONWs assemblies with cord-, chain-, and tube-like morphologies were grown at
1100˚C in Ar on the up- and down-stream sides of the Si substrate from the source materials of
GeO2 : CuO : C = 1 : 1 : 2. The chain- and tube-like SiGeONWs assemblies were dominant,
while traces of cord-like ones were observed. Figure 7 show the morphology of cord-like
SiGeONWs. At the tops of cord-like nanowires, a spheroid with the diameter around 1 μm was 
observed. SEM/EDS analyses showed that the spheroids are Cu-rich with the average
compositions of Cu : Si : Ge : O = 62.8 : 9.8 : 19.2 : 8.2. TEM/EDS analyses show that these
NWs are of amorphous SiGe oxide.
A SEM image of numerous chain-like wires is shown in Fig. 8. The chain-like wires taper off
from the top to the bottom. Their diameters are periodically modulated along the growth direction.
The chain-like wires possess a hollow structure with the shell composed of closely packed
nanowires on the Si substrate. It is supposed that the formation of Ge-Si1-xGexOy core-shell
structure is due to Ge precipitation in Si1-xGexOy via reduction of GeO2 by CO and Si atoms from
the Si substrate, while that of GeO2-Si1-xGexOy core-shell structure is due to GeO2 precipitation in
Si1-xGexOy via oxidation of GeO by CO2.
The growth of chain-, tube-, and cord-like SiGeONWs assemblies via the carbothermal
reduction of GeO2/CuO powders at 1100˚C folows the VLS mechanism. The formation of
chain-like SiGeONWs assemblies may be explained in terms of the periodic instability of the
CuSiGe droplets during growth. The present studies reveal that the size and chemical
compositions of catalysts as well as the reactants in the source materials and carrier gases have
significant effects on the growth and morphologies of SiGeONWs assemblies.

Abstract
Effects of moist Ar and Au film as a catalyst on enhancing the
growth of Ge-Si1-xGexOy core-shell nanowires (Ge-SiGeO NWs) and
Si1-xGexOy nanowires (SiGeONWs) on Si substrates via the carbothermal
reduction of GeO2 powders at 1100˚C at a flow rate of 200 sccm were
studied. The amount of Ge-SiGeO NWs and SiGeONWs increased with
the volume of water in the range of 0.5-2 ml, but decreased with more
water because of the exhaustion of more graphite powders. During
growth, the water vapor simultaneously serves as a reducer and an
using Au as a catalyst.1-13
It was reported that Ge nanocrystals can grow in sputtered
Si1-xGexO2 films and in the core of Si1-xGexOy nanowires via the reduction
process in ambients containing H218-20 and CO17, respectively. The water
vapor has been used as an oxidizer to promote the growth of ZnO,21,22
Ga2O3,23 CuO,24 and WO325 nanowires because it can produce oxygen at
an elevated temperature. However, the effect of the co-produced
hydrogen from the water vapor on the growth of nanowires remains to be
further studied.
In the present study, the double effects of Au film as a catalyst and
moist Ar on the growth of Ge-Si1-xGexOy core-shell nanowires
(Ge-SiGeO NWs) as functions of the thickness of Au films and the
volume of water loaded in the furnace via the carbothermal reduction of
GeO2 powders at 1100 C˚ were explored. Meanwhile, the growth of
Si1-xGexOy nanowire (SiGeONWs) assemblies was also enhanced. The
SiGeONWs have shown a blue shift of luminescent peaks26,27 and may be
more refractive than SiO2 nanowires in optical applications. The possible
mechanisms for the growth of both Ge-SiGeO NWs and SiGeONWs
were discussed, respectively.
200 sccm, no significant nanowires were grown on both the bare Si and
Au-coated Si substrates. When introducing a bit of water vapor into
flowing Ar, significant Ge-SiGeO NWs were grown as shown in Fig. 1.
Apparently, the Au film as a catalyst can further enhance the growth of
Ge-SiGeO NWs on Si substrates in moist Ar. In Fig. 1(b) some
nanoparticles grown on the surface of Ge-SiGeO NWs were identified to
be GeOx.
Figure 2 shows the TEM image of a Ge-SiGeO NW, where the
single-crystalline Ge core grows along its [111] direction and the shell is
amorphous with the chemical compositions of Si : Ge : O = 10 : 26 : 64.
In addition, a spheroid with the chemical compositions of Au : Si : Ge : O
= 41 : 3 : 21 : 35 is present at the tip of the Ge-SiGeO NW. The AuGe and
AuSi alloys have a eutectic point at 361 and 363 C˚, respectively. It was
reported that both the vapor-solid (VS) and vapor-liquid-solid (VLS)
processes can be responsible for the AuGe-catalyzed growth of Ge NWs
at temperatures below the eutectic temperature.13 In the present study, it
was confirmed that only the VLS process is responsible for the
AuSiGe-catalyzed growth of Ge-SiGeO NWs because the substrates are
immediately cooled in air after growth at 1100 C˚. However, the VS
For the VS process, GeO(g) and SiO(g) flow with the Ar gas to form
(Ge,Si)O2 particles on the Si substrate, and then the GeO2 in (Ge,Si)O2
particles can be reduced to Ge by hydrogen from the water vapor,
forming Ge-SiGeO core-shell nuclei. As GeO(g) and SiO(g) continue to
reach the Ge-SiGeO core-shell nuclei and undergo the reduction process,
Ge-SiGeO NWs can be formed on the Si substrate via the segregation of
Ge atoms through the SiGeO shell to the Ge core. In the present study,
significant Si was observed in the Ge-SiGeO NWs grown on the
Au-coated Si substrates, whereas nearly no Si was present in the
Ge-GeOx core-shell NWs grown on the bare Si substrates.28 It seems that
the AuSiGeO droplets can serve as a source of Si via the evaporation of
SiO from them.
3.2 Effects of Au thickness and the volume of water on the growth of
Ge-SiGeO NWs
With increasing the thickness of Au films in the range of 5-30 nm, the
number of Ge-SiGeO NWs increased, while their diameter and length
decreased from 650 to 300 nm and 60 to 20μm, respectively, as shown in
Fig. 5, revealing that thicker Au films can produce more AuSiGeO
droplets and thus more Ge-SiGeO nuclei. On the other hand, the amount
substrate.
3.4 Comparison of AuSiGeO-catalyzed growth between Ge-SiGeO
NWs and SiGeONWs
For the VLS growth of Ge-SiGeO NWs and SiGeONWs, only one
Ge-SiGeO NW was catalyzed by a nano-sized AuSiGeO droplet, while
several tens of SiGeONWs were simultaneously catalyzed by a
micro-sized one. From the aforementioned data, the Au/Ge atomic ratio,
41/21, of the nano-sized spheroid at the top of Ge-SiGeO NWs is quite
larger than that, 5/73, of the micro-sized spheroid at the top of SiGeONW
assemblies. It seems that nano-sized and Au-rich AuSiGeO droplets favor
the growth of Ge-SiGeO NWs, while micro-sized and Ge-rich ones favor
the growth of SiGeONWs. The chemical compositions and the size of the
droplets may affect the reaction kinetics. Therefore, it is possible that the
kinetic effect allow the reduction process assisted by hydrogen to occur in
Ge-SiGeO NWs rather than in SiGeONWs, and thus no single crystalline
Ge precipitates in the core of SiGeONWs.
4. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the double effects of moist Ar and Au film significantly
enhancd the growth of Ge-SiGeO NWs and SiGeONWs on Si substrates
