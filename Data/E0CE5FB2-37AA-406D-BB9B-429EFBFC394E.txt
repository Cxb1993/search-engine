This research will develop a travel time forecasting model which involves 
several technique issues. The user’s needs, the influence of accident, the traffic 
situation and the sequential update concept will be considered into the model. 
 
1.3 Research issues 
This research plans to build a travel time forecasting model with sequential update of 
accident duration. This estimation model develops a functional relation between 
real-time traffic data as the independent variables and real bus travel time as the 
dependent variable. Real-time traffic data are collected from the global position 
systems (GPS) on board of intercity buses, vehicle detectors (VD), and accident 
databases. From accident occurrence to its clearance, the traffic condition still 
changes continuously. Therefore, the inputs for prediction should be updated 
continuously through the duration of the accident. In order to emphasize the 
predictability of the model and the influence of the accident, this model considers the 
sequential update of forecasted accident duration as an important input. After the 
model is developed, the forecasted travel time can be provided by plugging in 
real-time traffic data into the equation whenever desirable. 
 
On highway, a user’s trip is traveling from the origin interchange to the 
destination interchange. This O-D path is linked by several roadway links. For 
developing a model more closely mirroring real traffic situations and the traveler 
behavior, partitioning the freeway into links for modeling is considered a proper 
approach. Once a link travel time forecasting model has been built, the forecasted 
path travel time can be obtained by summing the forecasted link travel time to fulfill 
the user’s trip characteristic. 
 
As shown in Figure 1-1, to build a highway travel time forecasting model with 
sequential update of accident duration is the target. After realizing the problem, the 
relevant literatures are reviewed, such as the travel time, accident duration and 
existing projects. The traffic data collection depends on the needs of this study and the 
existing data resources. Through the data analysis, the suitable data processes for the 
data, the adequate variables and the fitting data fusion techniques can be chosen for 
model building.  
 
In model building, the accident duration forecasting model will be built first for 
accident occurrence. To mirror the change of the traffic situation during the accident, 
the sequential update of accident duration forecasting model is built by increasing the 
model inputs. The final model is the highway travel time forecasting model which 
 4 
 
1.4 Limitation 
In this research, the travel time used in model building and evaluation is collected 
from the on-board GPS installed on the bus. The accident data only consider the data 
which significantly affect the normal traffic flow. Therefore, the predicted travel time 
of this model is more suitable for bus and the accident duration forecast model only 
can use to forecast the accident which significant affect the normal traffic flow.  
 
1.5 Main features 
The main features of this research are addressed as follows. 
 
1. User-oriented 
This research considers the travels’ needs in developing travel time model and 
accident duration model. On highway, the incidents that travelers most care about are 
the accident. During the accident, the travelers concern the latest situation and the 
influence of the accident. By this sequential update of accident duration model, the 
latest predicted information can be provided to the travelers during the accident. In 
order to fulfill the every possible O-D pairs of traveler, partitioning the freeway into 
links for modeling the travel time forecasting model is considered a proper approach. 
Once a link travel time forecasting model has been built, the forecasted path travel 
time can be obtained by summing the forecasted link travel time. The forecast travel 
time information can reduce the travelers’ uncertain feeling about the traffic, 
especially during the accident. This travel time model considers the influence of 
accident and mirror real traffic situation from user orientation. 
 
2. Considering the accident duration into the travel time forecasting model 
Based on the experience, the accident is one of important factors to cause the 
uncertainty in travel. Therefore, the accident data should be considered into the travel 
time forecast model. By realizing the relationship between the accident and the travel 
time, the precision of forecasted travel time will be improved during the accident. 
Besides the real-time data, the travel time forecasting model should consider the 
forecasted accident duration data as the model inputs to increase the ability in 
prediction.  
 
3. Sequential update of forecasting information 
Up to present, most researches about the travel time or accident duration 
forecasting focus on building the static forecasting mode. Both the travel and the 
accident take a period of time from the start to the end. In the process of the travel or

2. LITERATURE REVIEWS 
There are many issues related to this study, such as travel time, accident duration, data 
fusion and data feature reduction. Section 2.1 reviews freeway travel time researches 
and compares the methodologies, data sources, model inputs, model performance and 
main features among the researches. Accident duration studies are reviewed in 
Section 2.2. Section 2.3 introduces the data fusion technique and artificial neural 
network. The issues related to data feature reduction are addressed in Section 2.4. 
Review of freeway travel time project is in Section 2.5.  
 
2.1 Freeway travel time 
For travel time research, partitioning the roadway into several sections is a crucial 
procedure. The primary requirement is that the traffic environment and geometry 
should be similar within each section and dissimilar among sections. It is generally 
assumed that the path travel time is the addition of the travel times estimated for 
various sections. In Chen and Chiens’ study [2001], it is shown that under recurrent 
traffic conditions, the direct measurement of path-based travel times, rather than 
section-based travel times, could generate more accurate predictions. Section-based 
methods, on the other hand, may be sensitive to unforeseen accidents. 
 
Developing a travel time forecasting model often follows one of two approaches 
[Wan & Nakamura, 2002]. One uses some analysis methodology to build a relation 
between the travel time and relevant traffic data, such as speed, volumes, occupancy 
and historical estimated travel time [Park & Rilett, 1998; Palacharla & Nelson, 1999; 
Krikke, 2002; Chien et al., 2002; Zhang & Rice, 2003]. Another uses an estimation 
methodology to calculate the travel time based on distance and speed [D’angelo et al., 
1999; Lindveld et al., 2002; Huisken & Berkum, 2002; Coifman, 2002; Li et al., 
2006]. Representative studies on highway travel time forecasting in the past few years 
are summarized in Table 2-1. After assessing the methods employed in the literature, 
the analysis method is considered more reliable than the estimation method and is 
adopted for this research. 
 
The variables considered in developing travel time forecasting models are 
diverse. They include traffic volume [Palacharla & Nelson, 1999; Chien et al., 2002], 
occupancy rate [D’angelo et al., 1999; Palacharla & Nelson, 1999], vehicle speed 
[Cortes, et al., 2002; Lint, et al., 2003], delays [Chien et al., 2002] and historical 
travel time [Park & Rilett, 1999; Dharia & Adeli, 2003; Xu & Barth, 2006; Dion & 
Rakha, 2006]. This implies that all of these variables can be used to some extent to 
describe the traffic situation. Actually, spending a long time to collect data is difficult

Park & Rolett [1998][1999] and Huisken & Berkum [2002] respectively 
compared the performance among different algorithms in highway travel time 
forecasting. The MAPE has been chosen as the primary criterion for model evaluation, 
as shown in equation 2-1. Typical MAPE values for data and their assessment are 
shown in Table 2-2 [Lewis, 1982]. As the MAPE becomes closer to 0, the forecasted 
value becomes more accurate. As shown in Table 2-3, ANN shows better performance 
than other algorithms in modeling and forecasting.

As the most prominent approach presently used for solving complex problems, 
ANNs have been recently gaining popularity in transportation studies [Dougherty, 
1997; Wei & Chen, 2001]. Many studies have demonstrated that ANNs have the 
potential to accurately predict traffic conditions on freeways [Wan & Nakamura, 2002; 
Huisken & Berkum, 2002; Chien et al., 2002].  
 
After assessing the methods in our literature review, we found that the analysis 
 12 
three models cover the whole accident period, the forecast is not continuous from the 
start of prediction to the accident cleared. In traveler information services, forecasting 
duration by stage does not meet the user’s need.  
 
Wei and Lee [2005] developed the accident duration model by the data fusion 
techniques. This model provides a forecasted duration at the accident notification 
moment. The MAPE of forecasted results of the accident duration are mostly under 
20%. By the factor sensitivity analysis, the significant factors can be identified. The 
factors, time of day, number of vehicles & vehicle type involved in accident and 
geometry, have high significance in conducting the duration model. 
 
Previous studies found several highly significant factors for us in developing an 
accident duration model. Different from the hazard-based model and the regression 
approaches, the studies examine the data fusion techniques in modeling. Additionally, 
we consider traveler’s need and forecast the accident duration from the accident 
notification to the accident cleared. 
 
2.3 Data fusion with artificial neural network 
Data fusion is an evolving technique concerned with the problem of how to combine 
data from multiple sensors in order to make inferences about a physical event, activity, 
or situation [Hall, 1992]. The procedure of data fusion includes preliminary data 
filtering, data collections management, data alignment, association analysis, position 
fusion, identity fusion and situation assessment, as show in Figure 2-2. 
 
First, the existing sources of data collection must be evaluated comprehensively. 
According to the needs of information service, the criteria of the data filtering and 
data alignment can be performed. Analyzing the association among the collected data 
is usually performed by the parametric association method or the estimation technique. 
Through the data analysis, the suitable variables can be chosen for position fusion and 
identity fusion. The position fusion associate data into sets of the data belonging to 
the same dynamic entity and combine the data to estimate the location and velocity of 
an entity. In the identity fusion, the mission is combining the data from sensors to 
establish the identity of objects and developing a model to fuse the searched data to 
the information. Physical models, feature-based inference techniques and 
cognitive-based models are the three major identity fusion approaches. In order to 
comprehend the reliability of the fused information, assessing the information 
accuracy will be included.  
 
 14 
adequately represented by the ANN models [Chen & Chien, 2001; Wei & Lee, 2003]. 
Therefore, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as the key technique 
to develop our data fusion model.  
 
The ANN approach is a data-driven, self-adaptive, nonlinear methodology. 
Originally the design of ANN was motivated by considering an abstraction of the 
neural architecture of the human brain. First attempts to use the underlying theories 
for computational purposes came as early as in 1943 [McCulloch and Pitts, 1943]. An 
ANN consists of a number of data processing layers interconnected in a network. 
Each layer is a computational mechanism with mathematical functions. A layer 
receives input values from one layer and aggregates input values based on an input 
function. Then, the layer generates output values based on an output function. The 
output values are then routed to other layers, as designed by the architecture of the 
network. 
 
With the publication of the backpropagation algorithm, the interest of the 
research community in neural networks has been increasing up to this day. Although 
work continued throughout it received relatively little attention until the last several 
years, during which a growing interest in this kind of adaptive modeling technique has 
emerged. Some reasons for this fact may be found in the availability of faster 
computing facilities, the development of parallel computing architectures, a better 
documentation of ANN-related theory, and the increasing number of successful 
real-world implementations. 
 
Figure 2-3 shows the backpropagation algorithm of ANN networks. When 
inputting variables into the network, the weights from input layer to hidden layer are 
calculated. Through the transfer function in the hidden layer, the input data are 
rescaled as inputs to the output layer. When the relationship between the input and 
output variables is nonlinear, a hidden layer helps in extracting higher level features 
and facilitates generalization of outputs.

2.4 Freeway travel time information project review 
2.4.1 Travel time information in Taiwan 
From the north to the south in Taiwan, the average travel time is 5 hours using one of 
the two intercity freeways. However, variation may be significant due to various 
accidents along the way. In order to provide the predictive travel time information for 
the trips of medium-range and long-range, Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau 
(TANFB) set up travel time information signboards. In the initial stage, 10 signboards 
are sited right after each toll plaza in the central area of Taiwan. 
 
a) Data sources 
The predictive travel time will be calculated by estimation based on distance and 
speed. The average speed of traffic is collected from loop vehicle detectors which are 
installed at 0.5 to 9 kilometer intervals. TANFB also sets up a few automatic vehicle 
identifiers (AVI) near the signboards and important interchanges. AVI collects the 
actual travel time to calibrate the estimated travel time. 
 
The Taiwanese government also constructed the ETC system using in-vehicle 
transponder that incorporates integrated circuit card in 2003 when the annual average 
daily traffic volumes for highways increased from 1.0 million in 1996 to 1. 4 million 
in 2002 [Ministry of Transportation and Communications, 2006]. The construction 
was completed in 2005 and the system has administered by a company called Far 
Eastern Electronic Toll Collection since February 2006. As of June 2006, the ETC 
system is installed on 22 toll booths on highways in Taiwan and over 170,000 drivers 
fitted transponders in their vehicles. It is expected that the demand for transponders in 
Taiwan will be over 6 million in 2010 when the ETC system is fully administered on 
all highways around the country by that time. ETC can collect more accurate and 
reliable travel time of vehicles. Probe vehicle data and historical data are also 
considered to further enhance the estimation procedure in the near future. 
 
b) Information display 
The target users of travel time information services are the travelers of medium to 
long range. Therefore the contents of predicted travel time should be flexible. The 
information displayed on the travel time signboard will be rounded up to 300sec 
(5min) interval.  
 
c) System deployment

calculated based on distance and space-mean speed. Between Tai-pei and Hu-kou 
interchange, the model performance on two-way road section is between -22% and 
11% error percentage. Between Long-tan and Guan-si interchange, the forecasted 
effect is between -7%~20%. The executing duration of this project is from March 
2003 to October 2006. The major study subjects include provincial highway (and

study of system integration and model verification had been completed in the end of 
2006. The performance of travel time forecasting model during accident is not

two records before and after the interchange. The bus travel time can be computed 
with the passing time at two interchanges. This bus travel time which obtains from 
GPS is regarded as the actual travel time in this study. The data are stored in the

3.4 Accident duration data 
The relative frequency of duration for 39 accidents is constructed in Table 3-5. About 
49% of the accidents, the duration is less than 4000 seconds. The proportion of 
duration between 4001 seconds and 6000 seconds is 30%. The relative frequency of 
accident duration with more than 6001 seconds is around 21%. The 39 accidents are 
divided into two parts, 24 accidents for model training and 15 accidents for model 
testing. The 15 accidents for model testing are sampled randomly according to the 
relative frequency of duration.

4. ACCIDENT DURATION MODELS 
This section represents the sequential update of accident duration forecasting model 
development by fusing the VD data and accident information. Through the model, the 
forecasted accident duration can be provided continuously during the accident. Two 
types of accident duration models –Model A and Model B– are conducted in this study. 
Figure 4-1 illustrates the time points when these two models are employed to perform 
forecasts in accident duration. When an accident is being notified for the first time, 
Model A provides a preliminary forecast by using the traffic data which represent the 
traffic situation right before the accident. After the accident notified, Model B takes 
over Model A to perform forecasts with updated data. Model A and Model B together 
provide a sequential forecast for accident duration. In model development, feature 
reduction method is used to reduce the input features.

Figure 4-1. The concept of accident duration forecasting 
 
Section 4-1 and Section 4-2 define the Model A and Model B. Section 4-3 shows 
the data process of accident duration forecasting model. The detail about the model 
inputs and data alignment is described in Section 4.4. Three ways of feature reduction 
are addressed in Section 4.5. After feature reduction, the suitable variables for model 
training and testing will be determined. Section 4.6 shows the process of identity 
fusion. Model forecasting results are evaluated in Section 4-7. Section 4-8 
summarizes the study achievements of accident duration forecasting model. 
 
4.1 Model A: Accident duration forecasting model 
Model A found the relation function between the traffic data as the model inputs and 
the accident duration as the output variable at the accident notification.

than 540sec. The duration of these accidents are so short that they are not necessary to 
be processed in this model. The other mission is to revise the accident database such 
that each accident is associated with only one record. The exceeding records will be 
canceled or merged into one. The duration time of each accident is obtained from the 
corresponding first and last record. The VD data and the accident data are updated 
regularly for a fixed period of time.  
 
In this study, the definition of accident duration is the time between accident 
notification and accident road clearance and traffic recovery. Comparing the first 
record time of accident from database with the record time of VD data when traffic 
speed becomes declined, the earliest time point was chosen as the time of accident 
notification. Comparing the last record time of accident from database with the record 
time of VD data when traffic speed recovers, the last time point was chosen as the 
time of accident road clearance and traffic recovery. When the actual duration of an 
accident is not available, this integration is a plausible way to obtain an accident 
duration period as close as possible to a real one. 
 
In modeling, Model A is used to forecast duration period at the moment of 
accident notification while Model B provides sequential updates of accident duration 
after an accident is being notified. The input variables for both models are different. 
According to available inputs and accident locations, relevant data are aligned and 
shown in Table 4-1. 
 
The detail about the model inputs and data alignment is described in Section 4.4. 
The suitable variables for model training and testing will be determined. Section 4.5 
shows the process of identity fusion.

updated and when the accident was first noted, the time gap and the space gap 
associated with these data are considered as model inputs.

Figure 4-4. Spatiotemporal relationship between the accident and the VD data 
 
In Model A, input selection is based on the reporting time at accident notification 
moment. In terms of Figure 4-4, the accident occurs in Link 2 at 8:13 A.M. Before the 
elapsed time, the latest traffic data from VD as the model inputs are updated at 8:10 
A.M. To consider the space relation in the model, the data from the immediately 
adjacent links are also considered. The blocks marked with asterisks between 8:10 A. 
M. and 8:13 A. M. are considered as the inputs for Model A. The input variables for 
the Model B include the same input variables in Model A, and also consider the 
updated VD data after accident notification. The blocks marked with asterisks 
between 8:10 A. M. and 8:20 A. M. are considered as the inputs for Model B. Input 
data will be aligned as Table 4-1, input variables include accident characteristics, 
traffic data from VD, time relationship, space relationship, and geometry 
characteristics.

accident, horizontal is the number of heavy vehicles (truck, bus and trailer) in an 
accident and the color represents the accident duration. Each accident is plotted in the 
figure according to the number of passenger cars and heavy vehicles involved. As the 
Figure 4-6 showed, the accidents which produce the longer accident duration mostly 
involved the heavy vehicle.

Figure 4-6. The relationship between accident duration and number of vehicles 
 36 
Spatial relationship 
The distance between an accident and VD site presents likely variation of traffic 
situation. Generally speaking, the greater the distance, the longer the time is required 
to detect the influence of an accident in VD data. When an accident occurs, rescuers 
arrive at the accident location from neighboring interchanges. The distance between 
the accident and the neighboring interchanges is used to represent the time that 
rescuers take to arrive at an accident location. 
 
Geometry characteristics 
Highways have several kinds of geometric characteristics, and similar accidents may 
result in different durations in different geometries. Accident locations can be 
classified as interchange area, service area, and other types of areas. If an interchange 
is close to an accident and VD sites, using the VD data to present the traffic situation 
after the occurrence of an accident will be affected by that interchange. This is 
because the existence of the interchange between the accident and the VD in 
neighboring can explain the influence of the interchange on the VD data. A similar 
reason applies for considering the existence of a service facility between the accident 
and the neighboring VD. 
 
4.5 Identity fusion 
In identity fusion, ANNs are the key technique. The ANNs approach is a data-driven, 
self-adaptive, and nonlinear methodology. After model training, the mapping between 
variables and accident duration is formed. Then by inputting the data from tested 
examples into this trained model, the forecasted accident duration is produced. Figure 
4-8 is the schematic representation of an ANN network.

wih：Weights between input layer and hidden layer 
f：Transfer function at hidden layer 
θj：Threshold values at output layer 
whj：Weights between hidden layer and output layer 
g：Transfer function at output layer 
 
The ANN algorithm was coded in MATLAB and run on a Pentium-M desktop 
computer. There are 120, 60 and 1 nodes in the input, hidden and output layers, 
respectively. The conventional method (i.e., the average value of the numbers of input 
and output nodes) was selected to determine the number of hidden nodes. The data 
were scaled between [-1, 1]. The sigmoid method was chosen as the transfer function. 
Figure 4-9 shows the plots for training performance and epochs. In model training, the 
train-error slightly decreases from 10-2 in 300 epochs to 10-3 in 1000 epochs. The 
performance improvement from 300 epochs to 1000 epochs is less than 0.09. 
Therefore, the difference of training performance is not significant between 300 
epochs and 1000 epochs. The epoch was set as 300 for training in this study. Training 
time is generally less than 17 sec.

Typical MAPE values for data and their assessment are shown in Table 4-7 
[Lewis, 1982]. As the MAPE becomes closer to 0, the forecasted value becomes more 
accurate.

4.6 Model results 
The 39 accidents are divided into two parts, 24 accidents for model training and 
15 accidents for model testing. In this section, the model performance is compared by 
plots, MAE, R2 and MAPE. 
 
4.6.1 Model A 
Table 4-3 shows the performance of Model A by MAE, R2, MAPE and 
computing time. The MAE is 585 sec, the R2 is 0.896 and the MAPE is 12.3%.

time in the database. According to the traffic data, the traffic close to recover and 
model forecasts a short duration. But the accident is still durative in the incident 
database.

Table 4-4 shows the performance of Model B by MAE, R2, MAPE and

duration. In contrast to sequential forecasting, non-sequential forecasting provides the 
forecasted duration of each time point by subtracting the past time from the forecasted 
duration of Model A. The definition of past time is the time from accident notification 
to the time point of forecast. This comparison results indicate that sequential 
forecasting concept has been effectively applied to the accident duration forecasting 
task.

5. TRAVEL TIME MODELS 
For travel time models, first is the introduction of link travel time model in 
Section 5-1. Section 5-2 shows the data process of travel time forecasting model. The 
detail of model inputs and data alignment is described in Section 5.3. The suitable 
variables for model training and testing will be determined. The identity fusion is 
shown in Section 5.4. Section 5.5 evaluates the model forecasting effect for link, for 
path, with all data or without accident data. Section 5.6 summarizes the study 
achievements of accident duration forecasting model. 
 
5.1 Model C: Highway travel time forecasting model 
Highway travel time forecasting model is building a relation function between 
the traffic data as the model inputs and the travel time as the output variable. The 
traffic data includes the real time data form bus global position systems (GPS), 
vehicle detectors (VD), and incident databases. 
 
Before discussing the model development, we define the Link, the Section and 
the Path respectively and explain the relation among them. The Link is defined as the 
highway section between two neighboring interchanges. Each Link is connected to 
another. The Section refers the highway section between two particular interchanges 
according to the modeling request. Thus, a Section may cover several Links or be 
equal to a Link. Each Section is connected to another. As for the Path, we define it as 
an O-D pair between any two interchanges. The Path can be formed by linking 
consecutive Links. Each Path is independent of any others. 
 
If we were to build a travel time forecasting model for each O-D path, we would 
develop and maintain a large number of models. Although path-based travel time 
yields good accuracy, having too many models in a travel time information system 
rapidly becomes too complex to handle. Moreover, a path-based model is insensitive 
in reflecting the effect of irregular incidents in practice [Chen & Chien, 2001]. For 
developing a model more closely mirroring real traffic situations, partitioning the 
freeway into sections for modeling is considered a proper approach. Once a section 
travel time forecasting model has been built, the forecasted path travel time can be 
obtained by summing the forecasted section travel time. 
 
5.2 Model structure 
The flowchart of travel time model is shown in Figure 5-1. The data sources are most 
from GPS, VD, incident database and the forecasted accident duration.

5.3 Model inputs 
To qualify these data for data fusion, the base time is set when the designate bus 
passes through an interchange point. Figure 5-3 depicts the concept. If a bus passes 
through Interchange 2 at 8:13 A.M., the GPS data (bus running speed) are available at 
the same time. The existing accidents and duration of each accident are taken until 
8:13 A.M. Before the elapsed time, the latest VD data as the model inputs are updated 
at 8:10 A.M. To consider the space relation in the model, the data from the 
immediately neighboring links are also considered. The accident data for the entering 
link, previous link and next link are all used. The VD data are adopted from the 
previous and next links. The blocks marked with asterisks are the data selected for 
model development.

and 1000 sec. According to the difference of travel time, the time of day is divided 
into four parts, 6:00 a.m. ~ 10:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. ~ 4:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. ~ 8:00 p.m.

Under real traffic conditions, the stream may not propagate as suggested above. 
The speed of each vehicle will vary depending on individual drivers and traffic 
situations. The traffic data in a link may not be the same between Time T and Time 
T+5. As shown in Figure 5-10, representing one time interval later, traffic data Ta’ 
become lower than Ta, and Tc’ higher than Tc. The data Ta’ and Tc’ show the actual 
traffic situation, but cannot be effectively recorded by VD. Assessing the traffic data 
one time interval earlier results in a gap between the model inputs and actual traffic 
conditions. The adjacent links ought to be examined into model inputs at the same 
time. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as the key 
technique to explore the relation between the gap and travel time. The traffic variation 
is handled effectively in the ANN structure. The results are displayed in the next link.

The ANN algorithm was coded in MATLAB and run on a Pentium-M desktop 
computer. There are 87, 44 and 1 nodes in the input, hidden and output layers, 
respectively. The conventional method (i.e., the average value of the numbers of input 
and output nodes) was selected to determine the number of hidden nodes. The data 
were scaled between [-1, 1]. The sigmoid method was chosen as the transfer function. 
Figure 5-12 shows the plots for training performance and epochs. In model training, 
the train-error slightly decreases from 101.6 in 300 epochs to 101.4 in 1000 epochs. The 
performance improvement from 300 epochs to 1000 epochs is less than 0.2. Therefore, 
the difference of training performance is not significant between 300 epochs and 1000 
epochs. The epoch was set as 300 for training in this study. Training time is generally 
less than 60 sec.

The 4000 samples are divided into two parts, 3400 samples for model training and

plots, MAE, R2 and MAPE. 
 
5.5.1 Model C- accident factor sensitivity analysis 
In order to evaluate the effect of accident factor in Model C, we leave accident factor 
out and use the rest factors in modeling. If the model which is leaving accident factor 
out has a worse effect than the model with all factors, it indicates that the leaved 
factor has a good contribution to estimate the travel time. Table 5-4 is the models 
effect in accident factor sensitivity analysis. In terms of the MAE, R2 and MAPE

instead of at 10:10. Suppose that the travel time on Link 1 is forecasted by inputting 
the traffic data at 10:10 and the forecasted travel time is 18 minutes. By using the 
dynamic forecasting concept, the forecasted arrival time at interchange B will be 
projected as 10:28. Then, the historical traffic data at 10:28 will be used as the inputs 
for the Link 2 model in forecasting the travel time at Link 2. If an accident occurs in 
this link, then in order to consider the effect of the accident on the travel time, the 
forecasted accident duration will need to be adopted as the model input. Similarly, the 
forecasted travel time of 33 minutes in Link 2 will determine the composition of the 
inputs for the Link 3 model. An analogous process is applied to the subsequent 
downstream links until the trip destination is reached. The output of the last link 
model will be the forecasted arrival time of the trip in question. In contrast to dynamic 
forecasting, static forecasting is just the summation of travel times occurring at the 
same time in all links. The static forecasting approach is simple and, for shorter paths, 
might be an acceptable approximation.

Although the dynamic forecasting approach appears to be sensible, the 
interrelations between adjacent links and the interdependence among these links in a 
path are very complex. Previous studies and traditional methods did not handle these 
issues effectively. In our experiment, the structure of each individual model for a link 
takes these concerns into account with the unique features of the ANN method. As 
clearly shown in Table 5-1 and Figures 5-10, the spatio-temporal relations of traffic 
flow and the freeway sections are all included in the input layer. The learning phases 
of the ANN models facilitate the best performance of the most desirable properties of

5.6 Summary 
This study presents a travel time forecasting model using Artificial Neural Networks. 
In terms of the plot, MAE, R2 and MAPE, the proposed models have shown good and 
stable model performance. The plot represents the relationship between the forecasted 
travel time and actual travel time and the plot configuration shows linear relationship 
on the diagonal. The MAPE percentages are mostly under 17%. This shows that the 
developed model fits the actual travel time well whether during accident or not, and 
that Artificial Neural Networks effectively smooth data noise of the model.

6. MODEL VALIDATION 
The model validation includes validating the accident duration forecast and travel 
time forecast. Time period is 24 hours a day from August 12, 2005 to August 14, 
2005. 
 
6.1 Forecasted accident duration 
There are four accidents during these three days, as shown in Table 6-1. These 
accidents occur in different location and time of day. Figure 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 
show the validation results of forecasted accident duration. The forecasted accident 
duration decrease gradually with time past. These four figures display reasonable 
prediction results from accident notification to accident road clearance during traffic 
recovery. The first forecasted accident duration in each accident is a preliminary 
forecast by Model A and only uses the traffic data before the accident notification. 
After second prediction, Model B considers the real-time traffic data to adjust the 
forecasted results every five minutes. Therefore, the first forecast results do not near 
to the trend composed by other forecasts. In terms of this result, the real-time traffic 
data after accident notification is the important factor for providing the accurately 
forecasted accident duration.

6.2 Forecasted travel time 
Travel time model validation use the updated traffic data to provide forecasted travel 
time every 300sec (5 minutes) in 6 O-D pairs between An-ding and Lu-jhu 
intersection. Figure 6-5, 6-6, 6-7, 6-8, 6-9 and 6-10 show the forecasted travel time 
during August 12, 13 and 14, 2005. The forecasted travel time during a.m.8:00 ~ p.m. 
8:00 is longer than the forecasted travel time during p.m. 8:00 ~ a.m. 8:00. In the 
figures, the outliers are the prediction results affected by the accident.  
 
Accident 1 is notified at a.m. 7:56 in August 12 between An-ding and Yong-kang 
intersection. Due to the accident influence, the forecasted travel time during the 
accident duration from An-ding to Yong-kang, from An-ding to Tai-nan and from 
An-ding to Lu-jhu are longer than the forecasted travel time at usual. In the same day, 
Accident 2 occurs at 22:05 between Yong-kang and Tai-nan and increase the 
forecasted travel time of every path during 22:00 ~ 23:00. Between Tai-nan and 
Lu-jhu, Accident 3 occurs in the morning August 13. Every forecasted path travel 
time which pass through Tai-nan to Lu-jhu are affected during a.m. 8:00 ~ a.m. 9:00. 
 
When the accident duration decrease gradually, the longer forecasted travel time 
which affect by the accident are recover little by little to the normal range. Therefore, 
the predictions of this study really consider and reflect the accident influence. In terms 
of the plots in these six figures, Model C can provide the reasonable forecasted travel 
time with different traffic condition and time variation.

In order to clearly show the forecasting effect, the display unit of forecasted 
information is second in this study. However, the second of display unit is too detailed 
for traveler. Referring to travel time information systems in the world, the 
recommendation display unit is minute or five-minute.

the incident duration forecast model which considers the other types of incident, such 
as barrier. The incident which does not involve the vehicle in is barrier. Something 
drops on the road or animal walks on the road are belongs to barrier. 
 
In this research, the travel time used in model building and evaluation is 
collected from the on-board GPS installed on the bus. Future research can use two 
methods to extend this research results for the car user. One is use the similar 
procedure of this study to build another travel time forecasting model which uses the 
data collected from car. The other is to build a relationship function between the bus 
travel time and car travel time. The forecasted car travel time can be provided by 
plugging in forecasted bus travel time into this relationship function whenever 
desirable. 
 
This study develops the link travel time model and combining the links model 
can fulfill the every possible O-D pairs. The future research can evaluate the forecast 
effect when applying this link model to the road network. The influence by system 
interchange will be an important factor when combining the forecasted travel time 
from different highway. 
 
For the surface street travel time forecasting, future research could apply the 
similar approaches and methods with this study and add other factors which 
interference the traffic flow of surface streets to develop the model.  
 
7.3 Study contribution 
 
1. A sequential accident duration forecast model has been developed. This model 
sequentially update the forecasted accident duration from accident notification to 
accident road clearance and traffic recovery. The forecasted accident duration can 
reduce the road user’s uncertainty when the accident occurs on the trip. 
 
2. Considering the influence of recurrent incident and non-recurrent accident, 
dynamic travel time forecast model has been build. This model provides a 
real-time and accurate forecasted travel time to advance the service quality of 
highway transportation. 
 
3. This study developed a data fusion procedure. Through this procedure, the row 
data can be fused as the useful information which reduce the traveler’s uncertainty 
and give a message for traveler to make decision.

一、參加會議經過 
 
第 20 屆國際華人交通運輸協會年會於 2007 年 5 月 26~28 日在美國加州洛杉
磯盛大舉行，由該協會之南加州分會籌備相關活動，亦獲得多家國際性交通運輸
機構之贊助，例如：T. Y. Lin International, Declan, Econolite International, Parsons 
Brinckerhoff 等，因此具有相當多元化與國際化（照片 1、2）。

大會共安排兩場全體大會(Plenary session)、11 場技術論文發表(Technical 
session)、以及技術參觀。開幕典禮很別緻的安排在戶外帳篷式禮堂進行，當地
市長(City of Diamond Bar)、州議員(Monterey Park)等數人蒞臨致歡迎詞（照片 3、
4）。5 月 27 日午餐時段之專題演講(Keynote speech)相當精采，分別由國際運輸
工程師協會理事長(President of Institute of Transportation Engineers) Mr. Earl 
Newman，以及洛杉磯市規劃局長(Planning Commissioner, City of Los Angels) Mr. 
Michael Woo 提出精闢見解（照片 5、6）。

顯，推動大眾運輸與環境保護政策實為關鍵，而且以經濟有效的方式具體呈現，
優先落實在最不利且最有必要的場所，這種決心確實非常罕見。 
 
 BRT 系統給人的印象是遠高於一般公車服務水準，Orange Line 整體的呈現
確實達到極高水準，包含電子化票證、新型車體、專用路權與整合其他運輸工具
等，都有方便且具體的應用。（照片 7~12）。

構、學術與研究機構、民間公司為主。事實上，由於最初創立之發起成員亦包含
上述三類機構之成員，所以至今仍能維持相當密切之產學合作交流與學術研究成
果。回想 1989-1993 年在美國攻讀博士期間，也曾數次參加 ICTPA 之年會，當
時以留學生之身分立場，對於活躍於美國交通運輸界之產官學研華人先進，曾是
充滿景仰與羨慕之心。如今雖不再有羨慕之意，卻是更多欽佩與感激。在海外的
華人，必須付出更多的努力，才能在異鄉得取事業發展的機會，也要有更優異的
成績才能得到外國人的尊重，進而成為主流群體之一員，甚至成為領導人。藉著
海外先進的深厚基礎，我們才得以較深入學習先進國家社會在交通運輸系統的思
維與做法，進一步傳授給國內的學子；也由於海外華人在專業領域崗位之成就，
使得「臺灣」廣為國外熟知與接納，形成良性的互動。由大會邀請出席之當地政
治界領袖及學術界先進，對於本活動之推崇與支持，就可以充分體會。

大會年度主題為「創造交通運輸的新紀元(Creating New Era for Transportation)」，兩
場全體大會分別由不同地區民眾(Views from Different Regions)及不同專業領域之代表
(Views from Different Disciplines)各自提出報告，再經由與會人員提出意見交互討論。此
種安排不但反映目前快速全球化之趨勢，也令人必須正視多元科技整合及永續環境之課
題。 
 
台灣地區出席者約 20 人，領隊為中華民國運輸學會理事長陳武正教授(中華大學管
理學院院長)，成員包含台大、成大、警大師生、警政署及顧問公司等，共發表 9 篇論
文。 
 
二、技術參觀活動 
 
 眾所周知的加州是個幅員廣大、開闊發展的區域，尤其南加州洛杉磯地區根本就是
公路系統極度發達之小汽車使用者天堂，數十年來幾乎沒有人認為南加州會有成功的大
眾運輸系統，至多只有市中心區少數必備的基本服務路線。然而，近 5 年來，交通運輸
專業的努力終於有效的打破長期迷思，大眾運輸系統的推展已有顯著進展，某些課題的
成果更是領先全國各大都市，也站上世界舞台。 
 
 大會安排參觀的第一站就令人有全新的觀感，因為參觀主題是目前國際上赫赫有名
的公車捷運系統(Bus Rapid Transit, BRT)。LA Metro Orange Line 為美國第一條營運之
BRT 路線，而且就在小汽車使用率特高的南加州，非常不符合一般狀況下大眾運輸之使

 下午的主題是久聞其名的洛杉磯市自動化交通監控系統(Automated Traffic 
Surveillance And Control System, ATSAC)，洛杉磯市區交通流量大且擁塞嚴重是長
期困擾的問題，所以市政當局也不斷努力來對抗這些挑戰。ATSAC 經驗豐富，曾吸引台
灣各都市交通單位主管與學術單位來參訪，也在美國國內享有盛名，以全美第三大城之
地位而言，ATSAC 要擔負很大的責任。然而 ATSAC 仍有潛在之困境，主要是由於建置較
早，先前之設備與空間在今日的需求標準來看，皆非上乘之選，反而由於既有設施不能
停止運轉，造成整體系統更新與整合過程的困擾。(照片 13~16)

 ATSAC 最近新增一項路口優先號誌功能，能搭配前述 BRT 之運行狀況，給予適當之
優先通行權，確保 BRT 車輛在落後時刻表之狀況下，有機會逐漸回復原定的運行時刻。
依據相關研究報告，民眾對於大眾運輸服務品質的感受，「準時運行」指標具有相當高
的期許，所以經由公車定位系統之掌握行車動態，配以路口號誌優先權之提供，進一步
提升大眾運輸系統之服務水準。這部份是臺灣地區各都市仍在努力的方向，最主要的關
鍵在於主政者之決策，是否願意彰顯大眾運輸在都市發展中之重要地位，進而藉由科技
化手段予以落實，而後者已經是成熟可行的實例。
