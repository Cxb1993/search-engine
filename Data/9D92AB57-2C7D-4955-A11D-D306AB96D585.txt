Abstract 
In this paper, a reflex charging strategy with the energy 
recovery function for a bidirectional converter (BC) is proposed 
to build a novel reflex-based BC (RBC) for increasing the battery 
charging efficiency in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). 
The proposed RBC can provide a reflex charging current profile 
to charge the battery to obtain a high battery charging efficiency 
and prolong the battery life cycle. Specially, negative pulse 
energy of the reflex charging current profile in the proposed 
RBC is recovered to reduce the battery charging dissipation. A 
400W prototype is design and implemented to verify the 
feasibility of the proposed RBC. Compared with a typical 
bidirectional converter, the battery charging efficiency and the 
battery charging speed are improved about 10% and 8.8% by 
the proposed RBC, respectively.  
 
Keywords: bidirectional converter, uninterruptible power supply, 
battery charging efficiency, battery charging speed, 
battery thermal deterioration effect 
 
I. Introduction 
Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) are widely used to 
supply stable and reliable power to critical loads, such as 
telecommunication systems, computers and emergency 
systems. According to the standard IEC 62040-3, UPSs are 
classifies into three types: offline UPS, line interactive UPS 
and online UPS [1]-[3]. Among these types, the online UPS 
outputs are independent of the input voltage and frequency 
and can provide better quality power to critical loads. The 
development of online UPS has rapidly proliferated in recent 
years [3]-[6]. Figure 1 shows a typical block diagram of an 
online UPS, which consists of a power factor corrector (PFC) 
a DC/DC converter, a DC/AC converter and a bidirectional 
converter (BC). The BC can transfer the power flow between 
two DC sources in either direction. This unit is widely used in 
UPS, renewable energy systems and automotive electronics 
[4]- [8]. Because a battery bank has a great impact on the cost, 
weight and volume of the UPS system, the BC is one of the 
most important subsystems in an online UPS. Increasing the 
energy transfer efficiency eη  using a smaller battery bank 
and prolonging the battery life cycle are very important. 
Recently, many BC topologies with soft-switching ability 
have been reported to increase the BC transfer efficiency cη  
[5], [6], [9], [10]. From Fig. 1, we can see that the energy 
transfer efficiency eη  can be written as  
 
bce ηηη ⋅= , (1) 
 
where bη  is the battery charging efficiency. However, 
increasing the battery charging efficiency bη  and prolonging 
battery life cycle have not been considered in the 
conventional BC.

In this paper, a reflex charging strategy is built into a BC to 
improve the battery charging efficiency bη  and prolong the 
battery life cycle. The reflex charging strategy provides a 
negative pulse and resting time to diffuse and neutralize the 
electrolyte density and slow down the increasing internal 
pressure [11]. This approach could be widely used in 
advanced battery systems [12]-[15]. In general, a dissipation 
load is used to discharge the battery with a desired negative 
pulse current [16]. This causes unnecessary dissipation which 
decreases the energy efficiency. Interestingly, using the 
inherent bidirectional current flow ability of a BC, the 
negative pulse energy can be recovered to the DC bus 
capacity Cbus to avoid unnecessary dissipation. This novel 
bidirectional DC/DC converter is called a reflex-based 
bidirectional converter (RBC). To verify the feasibility of the 
proposed RBC, a 400W prototype is designed and 
implemented. Compared with a conventional BC, the 
charging efficiency is improved by about 10%. 
 
II. Circuit Description

2.1.2 Negative pulse period (NPP) 
The NPP is used to diffuse and distribute electrolyte ions 
more evenly to retard the polarization to increase the battery 
charging efficiency and life cycle. In the NPP, the proposed 
RBC works as a boost converter with the current control 
function. Thus, the power flow direction of the proposed RBC 
is from the battery bank to the DC bus to discharge the battery 
with current Ibatt. Specially, the discharge energy of the battery 
bank is recovered to the DC bus capacity Cbus to avoid 
unnecessary dissipation. The operation is divided into two 
states and described as follows: 
 
(c) State 3 ( 43 tt → ): At 3t , the power MOSFET 2S  is 
turned on and the power MOSFET 1S  is turned off, the 
current in filtering inductor pL  decrease to zero and then 
charges polarity as shown in Fig. 4(c). In this state, the 
voltage across filtering inductor pL  is about battV−  so 
that the current in filtering inductor pL  begins to 
increase linearly with slope pbatt LV /− .  
 
(d)  State 4 ( 54 tt → ):  At 4t , the power MOSFETs 1S  and 
2S  are turned off and the body diode 1D  starts 
conducting as shown in Fig. 4(d). In this state, the voltage 
across filtering inductor pL  is about battbus VV −  so 
that the current in filtering inductor pL  begins to 
decrease linearly with slope pbattbus LVV /)( − . Filtering 
inductor pL  is now discharge. DC bus capacitor busC  
starts to be charged by the battery bank discharging 
current.  
 
The filtering inductor current 
pLI  (i.e, battery current battI ) 
in the NPP can be expressed as

2.1.3 Resting period (RP) 
State 5 ( 76 tt → ): In the RP, the power MOSFETs 1S  and 
2S  are turned off to disconnect the DC bus and battery bank, 
as shown in Fig. 4(e). The RP is used to diffuse and distribute 
the electrolyte ions to neutralize the electrolyte density and 
increase the battery charging efficiency and life cycle.  
 
2.2 Discharging mode 
At load depletion, the current is increased or the power 
source supply current decreases or fails. The circuit is 
which operation mode the RBC works in. The RBC works in 
the PPP when the buck enable E1 acts logic high and the boost 
enable E2 acts logic low. The RBC works in the NPP when the 
boost enable E1 acts logic high and the buck enable E2 acts 
logic low. The RBC works in the RP when both of the boost 
enable E1 and the buck enable E2 act logic low at the same 
time. 
 
V. Experimental Results 
Figure 9 shows the waveforms of the MOSFET gate-source 
voltages 1gsV  and 2gsV , the battery voltage battV , and the 
battery charging current battI  of the proposed RBC. It is 
clear that the proposed RBC sequentially works in the PPP, 
the NPP and the RP to charge the battery as the reflex 
charging strategy as we wanted.

To verify the performance of the proposed RBC, a typical 
BC was also conducted and compared. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) 
show the battery charging current Ibatt and the charging 
capacity with respect to the charge time. From Fig. 10(a), it is 
clear that the charging time of the proposed RBC and the 
general BC are 3.1 hours and 3.4 hours, respectively. The 
charging speed of the proposed RBC has been increased about 
8.8% compared with that of the conventional BC. Fig. 10(b), 
it is evident that the total charging capacities for the proposed 
RBC and the general BC are 45.8 AH and 50.9 AH, 
respectively. The charging capacity of the proposed RBC has 
been reduced about 10% compared with that of the general 
BC. This indicates that the battery charge efficiency is 
improved about10% by the proposed RBC.

VI. Conclusions 
A reflex charging strategy with the energy recovery 
function for a bidirectional converter (BC) was successfully 
proposed to build a novel reflex-based BC (RBC) for 
increasing the battery charging efficiency in an uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS). The proposed RBC can provide a reflex 
charging current profile to charge the battery to obtain a high 
battery charging efficiency and prolong the battery life cycle. 
The energy at the negative pulse charging period at the reflex 
charging current profile is recovered to reduce the battery 
charging dissipation. The soft transfer method was 
successfully proposed to really erase the spike current in the 
RBC to prolong the battery and circuit part life times. A 400W 
prototype was also designed and implemented to verify the 
feasibility of the proposed RBC. Compared with a typical 
bidirectional converter, the charging efficiency, the charging 
speed and the thermal deterioration effect were improved 
about 10%, 8.8% and 7% by the proposed RBC, respectively.
