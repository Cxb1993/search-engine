2especially at room temperature, as compared
with aluminum and its alloys. Since slip at
room temperature is limited to the basal
plane, the processing and forming
capabilities of magnesium alloys are
generally fairly poor.
Alloying Mg with lithium yields a lightest
structural metal of Mg–Li alloy. The Mg-Li
phase diagram [4] indicates that when the Li
content is between ~5.5 and 11.5 wt%, the
BCC structured β phase of the Li solid 
solution co-exists with the HCP phase of
the Mg solid solution. The single phase
structure could exist for Li contents greater
than 11 wt%. As the amount of Li added to
the Mg-Li alloy increases, the phase still
possesses HCP structure, but the crystal
lattice axes ratio, c/a decreases such that slip
between crystal planes become less difficult
[5], the co-existence of the β phase makes
the Mg–Li alloy possible to be cold worked.
However, the mechanical properties of
Mg–Li alloy are not particularly favorable
for structural applications due to its low
tensile and yield strength. Various third
elements have been added to the Mg–Li
alloy systems to explore the effect of the
addition of a third element on the
mechanical properties and formability [6-9].
Al addition has been selected as a
precipitation and solid solution hardener
[10,11], and Zn could be added to improve
the cold formability [12]. Bach et al [11]
demonstrated that the ductility of the
Mg–Li–Al alloy could be improved by
minor additions of RE elements. Scandium
(Sc) has been chosen as an alloying element
for improving the creep resistance of
magnesium alloys [13]. Al alloys containing
Sc have been developed as high strength Al
alloys [14]. Minor addition of Sc results in
the formation of fine dispersed Al3Sc
compound to enhance the strengthening
effect in Al alloys.

In this work, an Mg–Li–Al–Zn
(designated as LAZ) alloy containing about
10wt% of Li was chosen as the matrix alloy.
Main emphasis was placed on investigating
the effects of minor Sc addition on the
microstructures and mechanical properties
of the LAZ alloy processed by heat and
mechanical treatments.
2. Materials and Experimental
Procedures
2.1 Alloys
The Mg–Li alloy was melted in a
high-vacuum electric induction furnace
under an argon atmosphere and then cast
into an ingot with a cylindrical shape of 200
mm in diameter and 400 in mm height. The
analyzed chemical composition of the cast
alloy by use of an induction coupled plasma
(ICP) and Spark Optical Emission
Spectrometry (Spark-OES) apparatuses is
given in Table 1. The cylindrical ingots were
then extruded into a plate of 110 mm in
width and 10 mm in thickness at a billet
preheating temperature of 200C.
2.2 Age heat treatment and
thermomechanical processing
The as-extruded specimen for alloy
LAZ1010Sc was annealed at 300C for 1 h
followed by quenching, annealed specimen
was then aged at room temperature, 50, 100,
150, and 200C for 1-16 h.
The annealed specimen was cold rolled
with the reductions of 20, 40, 60, and 80%.
Reference specimens for comparison were
directly cold rolled from the extruded plate
with the same reductions as used for the
annealed specimens to explore the effect of
annealing heat treatment on cold working.
2.3. Tensile Tests
Uniaxial tension test was carried out in
the direction along the extrusion and rolling
direction. The gauge length and width of the
tensile specimen were 50 and 6 mm,
4Fig 2 demonstrates the as-extruded
microstructure of alloy LAZ1010Sc. Fibrous
structures were not observed in this study.
Dynamic recrystallization should have taken
place during extrusion, and some grain
growth could be found in the as-extruded
structure. Dynamic recrystallization of 
phase was also found in the as-extruded
Mg–8.7Li and Mg–8.5Li–6.4A1 alloy [15].
The rod-shaped particles still present inside
the grains.
A Widmanstätten type morphology of 
phase present in the matrix was observed
in the microstructure of the aged
LAZ1010Sc alloy, as demonstrated in Fig.
3(a), but not found in the aged alloy of
LAZ1010, as given in Fig. 3(b). The
Widmanstätten structure was also found in
the squeeze cast Mg–10wt%Li–3wt%Al, but
not in the squeeze cast Mg–8wt%Li–3wt%
Al [8].
3.2 Age heat treatment
Changes in hardness during aging for
LAZ1010Sc alloy are illustrated in Fig. 4.
Age hardening for LAZ1110Sc alloy could
only be observed for aging at room
temperature, hardness increases with aging
time up to about 4~5 h, only decrease in
hardness with aging time was observed for
aging at temperatures higher than 50C.
Fig. 5 shows hardness variation at various
temperatures aged for 4 h. The hardness
decreases rapidly with temperature at
temperatures below 50C, the rapid decrease
in hardness should be related to the
transformation of the phase into the
equilibrium phase AlLi. Alloying Mg–Li
with Al can form coherent metastable
MgLi2Al) precipitate to strengthen the
phase matrix in the Mg–Li–Al alloys
[16-18], however the fully hardened alloys
were softened due to the transformation of
phase into an equilibrium phase AlLi at
intermediate temperatures. Fig. 5 indicates
that the transformation of phase should be
at a temperature below 50C.

6increases in strengths, compared to the
properties of the as-extruded specimens,
were found for the specimens with a prior
annealing treatment. An increases in tensile
strength for a reduction of 80% is 46.5% for
LAZ1010Sc alloy.
4. Conclusions
The effects of thermal and mechanical
treatments on the microstructures and
mechanical behaviors of an MgLibased
alloy containing minor addition of Sc were
investigated in this study. The as-cast
structure of LAZ1010Sc alloy presented a
dual phase microstructure of a matrix and
a distributed phase, and small rod-shaped
particles of Mg phase could be observed
inside the grains. The LAZ1010Sc alloy
could only be naturally aged, the aged
LAZ1010Sc alloy presented a
Widmanstätten type morphology of phase
in the matrixminor Sc addition would
shift the transformation of the phase into
the equilibrium phase AlLi to a lower
temperature. The strengths of the MgLi
based alloy could be improved by a minor
addition of Sc. The naturally aged
LAZ1010Sc alloy revealed a yield strength
of 172.1 MPa, a tensile strength of 186.4
MPa with an elongation of 27.1%. Work
hardening effect could be enhanced by a
prior annealing treatment carried out on the
extruded plate before cold rolling.
