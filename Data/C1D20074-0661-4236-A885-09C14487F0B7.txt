前言、研究目的、文獻探討 
 
Microwave polarization and related topics is a historical research branch of the 
electromagnetic wave engineering. At lower frequencies, it is extensively applied to 
communication and ground-based communication, microwave imaging system, and polarized 
radar. However, the related research on the millimeter-wave range is not noticed by scientists 
and engineers due to the difficulties on component fabrication, measurement and demand by 
communication application. In the most recent decade, this topic is noticed and studied by the 
requirement of the radio astronomical instrumentations. One of the key components for 
millimeter-wave polarization, the orthomode transducer, is significantly developed in the most 
recent few years. [1-6]。 
One of the most challenging parts of the research on the millimeter-wave polarization is the 
calibration and measurement of the instruments and the devices. For example, an orthomode 
transducer contains three physical ports, one of them is dual-polarized and the others are 
single-polarized and single-mode. In microwave circuit theory, the dual-polarized port should be 
treated as two electrical ports in the circuit analysis. If these two orthogonal polarizations at the 
same physical port are with the same propagation constant, then the case in circuit analysis is 
with two degenerated ports。The port-reduction method on the multi-port microwave circuit 
measurement and calibration techniques [7-8] is not valid in this case, thus, the precise calibration 
and measurement of the scattering parameters is difficult. One of the conventional approach is to 
add a rectangular-to-square waveguide taper, or rectangular-to-circular waveguide transition to 
this dual-polarized port and then the four-port problem is reduced to three port, However, the 
calibration and measurement procedure is quite complex[9],  and  the polarization transform 
inside waveguide taper /transition increases the measurement error. A new solution is proposed 
and demonstrated by an Italian team [10], but the algorithm is sophisticate, the required 
calibrators is difficult to fabricate, and the measurement result is only up to Q-band (33-50GHz). 
For the orthomode transducer and the dual-polarization antenna, new calibration and 
measurement method is proposed.  
The other challenging of the millimeter-wave polarization measurement is to design a 
simple and effective broadband phasor measurement network. The key point of the polarization 
measurement is to precisely calculate the phase difference and amplitude ratio of the signal from 
cross- or co- polarization modes. When utilizing to the astronomical instrumentation, the 
capability of handling broadband signal is preferred. In order to achieve such requirement, The 
signals separated from orthomode transducer should pass through a series of 3-dB signal dividing 
and combining with 0°, 90°or 180°phase difference. After amplified, the processed signals are 
measured by highly sensitive power detector or heterodyne receiver. The network of the3-dB 
signal dividing and combining can be regarded as a variation of the six-port based automated 
network analyzer [11-12]. Even the radio astronomical instrumentation for the cosmic microwave

The progresses on the theoretical part of this measurement are (1) algorithm is developed and 
revised, (2) analysis on errors due to several practical environments are derived.

The problem consider in this topic is a dual-polarization antenna with dual feed port, since the 
radiation ports of the antenna is physically identical at the same place, it is impossible to measure 
the scattering parameters of the antenna system including both feed-port and radiation port by 
network analyzer directly. The method developed in this stage is to find the feasible and 
appropriate calibration objects and derived the algorithm to solve the four-port scattering 
parameters from the measured two-port scattering parameters. The three calibrations objects 
chosen are metallic plates, flat plate covered with millimeter-wave absorbers, and dihedral corner 
reflector. The dihedral corner reflector will be rotated in 6 different orientation angles at 0°, 90°, 
22.5°, -67.5°, 45° and -45°.  Then one can get the scattering matrix of the calibration objects are

These four equations finally get 013 =s , thus there is not able to get nontrivial solution from this 
measurement. It seems the dihedral corner reflector in various orientations as calibrators are not 
completely linearly independent each other. To get sufficient linear independent calibrator to 
solve the problem nontrivially, an additional calibrator is required. We considered preparing a 
wire grid polarizer in front of a absorber to form another calibrator, which is with total reflection 
in one polarization but perfectly matched at the other polarization.

This can be an innovative way to get the solution of the problem. However, in practical aspect, 
large aperture wire grid polarizer is very expensive. An alternative possible way is to shift the 
metallic plate by quarter wavelength. However, for our measurement setup with W-band 
frequency antenna, this means a 0.75mm shifting of the 50cm metallic plate. This is challenging 
on mechanical precision, but we will try it soon. 
 
Part II. Polarimetric Measurement Circuit 
 
 In previous project we reported the 4-8GHz evaluation version of the polarimetric 
measurement circuit. The planar version implemented by microstrip line cannot get satisfied 
flatness on the phase difference and amplitude balance. The main difficulty is the accumulation of 
the errors of individual components leads to the large phase error (up to 30 degree) and amplitude 
error (up to 3dB). The only way is to change the 3-dB 90 degree hybrid coupler design with 
ultra-wideband frequency response. This is not possible to use planar circuit to implement. A 
broadside-coupled 3-dB 90 degree hybrid coupler is more feasible way.

voltage, gate 1 voltage -0.1V, LO power -2.1dBm 
(2) W-band subharmonic diode mixer and W-band image rejection diode mixer 
For matching the antenna under test to form an integrated system, two different types of mixers 
are considered. One is the W-band sub-harmonic diode mixer developed before. Based on 
previous development, we try to test its cryogenic performance, and for research purpose, we also 
test it photonic response in cryogenic temperature. The result was presented in the conference 
paper [14]. 
Another mixer is a W-band image-rejection diode mixer. The GaAs PHEMT MMIC chip was 
also designed and developed by Professor Huei Wang in National Taiwan University. The mixer 
block design, fabrication, packaging, wire bonding, and packaged module testing were 
implemented in out laboratory. Fig. 4 shows the measured conversion loss and image rejection 
ratio when the mixer module integrated with a 1-18GHz wideband 3dB quadrature hybrid coupler. 
Please note that the conversion loss is not very low but the flatness of the frequency response is 
excellent.

With so many years hard working and struggling, this is the first time ASIAA can form a 
three-member team to attend a world-class international conference on microwave engineering. Due 
to the restriction on the travel of assistant, Su-Wei Chang cannot attend this conference and I 
presented his paper. 
Report on the Selected Conference Papers 
The followings are the sessions I attended during the conferences: 
Monday (Morning) 
EuMIC01 GaAs Circuits and Applications 
This is the first session of the European Microwave Week. The first paper is presented by Dr. C.-C. 
Chiong. It is a report on the work for ALMA band-1 4-12GHz MHEMT IF amplifier packaging and the 
measurement of cryogenic performance. The second paper is presented by Dr. T. M. Tsai from NTUEE 
for his novel design of cascade HEMT mixer with improved operation theory and very wideband and 
excellent performance suitable for our future ALMA Band-1 receiver development. In this paper, a new 
theory on the operating mode and broadband matching of the cascade transistor is presented.  
WHMO3 (EuMIC) 
The topics of this half-day workshop is “nonlinear noise modeling and large signal low-noise 
microwave circuit design” Since the time schedule is conflict with the session EuMIC01, I attend this 
workshop from its second talk. Nonlinear transistor modeling is still a new topic. This workshop 
incorporates the most recent development on HBT and FET modeling, but not significant improvement 
and development compared to the most recent empirical equation model is for HEMT which is 
developed by Prof. I. Angelov in Chalmers. The design of large signal low-noise circuits like 
low-phase-noise oscillator, low-noise mixer and high-linear low-noise amplifier are also discussed.  
Monday (afternoon) 
EuMIC07 Voltage-Controlled Oscillators 
This session is discussed the voltage-controlled oscillator design. The first paper is presented by a 
graduate student from National Central University, The second paper is a mmw VCO using SiGe2RF 
Telefunken Semiconductor. The third paper is a 57-63GHz quadrature VCO in 65nm CMOS 
technology. The fourth paper is a 100nm MHEMT VCO with 82.5-96.3GHz tuning bandwidth, and the 
fifth paper is a D-band 115GHz CMOS VCO   
EuMIC11 MM-Wave Circuit 
This session collect some millimeter-wave circuits, five papers cover the research area including 
receiver, sub-harmonic self-oscillating mixer, 300GHz active doubler and integrated resistive mixer, 
telescope. 
EuMC21 Si Technology for 60GHz Application 
As silicon technology goes to smaller device size, it is capable to realize the millimeter-wave integrated 
circuit on Si-based CMOS or SiGe BiCMOS process. The five papers include 90-nm Si CMOS, 130nm 
SiGe BiCMOS, and 130nm Si CMOS process. The Silicon technology will play very important role on 
the civil and military communication system in millimeter-wave frequency, however, for radio 
astronomical instrumentation, both the receiver front end and the local oscillator, Si-based MMIC 
cannot get state of the art low-noise performance and the extremely chip size make it difficult to 
packaged into the system, but it is wroth to note that it will play important role as the backend 
component in the future.  
Wednesday (afternoon) 
EuMC31 Novel Microwave Technologies 
The first paper is worth to note because it is the paper directed to the carbon nano-tube as RF device. 
This is a very first step; there must be lots of progress to be investigated on the nano-tube device for RF 
and microwave technology. 
Thursday (morning) 
EuMC42 
The 5th paper entitled “Planar Circuits for Non-Contact Near-Field Microwave Imaging” use the 
sub-wavelength resolution near-field microwave imaging technology, which is similar to the one Prof. 
C.-K. Sun in NTUEE extensively used for imaging. This paper uses this technique for integrated circuit 
imaging.   
EuMC44 THz Components-1, -2, -3 
I presented the paper “A 660 GHz local oscillator subsystem: design, testing and alignment” for Su-Wei 
Chang on his work with Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory on the Submillimeter Array (SMA) 
600-696GHz local oscillator upgrade. The first paper is the one done by a Russian team related to 
frequency selective surface (FSS) at millimeter-wave and THz region, the second paper is a microwave 
kinetic inductance detector (MKID) based receiver array developed by the Netherlands team for future 
space astronomical instrumentation. 
EuMC48-4, -5 
There is one paper related to radio astronomical receiver is worth to noted in this session. The fifth 
paper entitled “Realization of a focal plane array receiver system for radio astronomical applications” 
describe the PHAROS (Phased Array for Reflector Observing System) project developed by the 
international team of Britain, Italy, and the Netherlands, it is a 6.7GHz focal plan receiver. 
Poster paper worth to note 
There are several poster papers with quite good innovation. EuMIC Poster01-7 entitled “InGaP-GaAs 
HBT Push-Push VCO with broadband tuning range” developed by Chalmers Univ. Tech. and Ericsson 
AB Sweden is a good reference of the HBT VCO design for ALMA MMIC based local oscillators.
