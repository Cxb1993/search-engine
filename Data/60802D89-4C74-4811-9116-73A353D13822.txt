Water-assisted injection molding has advantages over its better known competitor
process, gas-assisted injection molding [5,6], because it incorporates a shorter cycle time
to successfully mold a part due to the higher cooling capacity of the water during the
molding process. The incompressibility, low cost, and ease of recycling water makes it an
ideal medium for the process. Since water does not dissolve and diffuse into the polymer
melt during the molding process, the internal foaming phenomenon [7] that usually occurs
in gas-assisted injection molded parts can be eliminated. In addition, water-assisted
injection molding better enables the molding of larger parts with small residual
wall thickness.
Today, short glass fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites have the fastest rate of
development and represent 30% of the composite market. Water-assisted injection
molding of glass fiber-reinforced composites has the capability of producing parts
having thick and thin sections with good structural rigidity. There is a necessity to gain
a better understanding of this new technology. Up to the present, the research on
the water-assisted injection molding of thermoplastic composites has been limited.
Knights [1] reported that glass-filled automotive ducts could be successfully molded
by the water-assisted injection molding technology. Michaeli et al [2]. studied the
water-assisted injection molding of both polypropylene (PP) and glass fiber-filled
PP composite pipe components. They found that the cooling time needed for
water-assisted injection molded PP composites was shorter than that for gas-assisted
injection molded composites. Liu and Chen [3] also studied the moldability of
PP composites and some irregular water penetration behavior was observed in
the composites.
This report was carried out to study the water-assisted injection molding of glass fiber-
reinforced Nylon composites. Experiments were carried out on an 80 ton injection molding
machine equipped with a water injection unit developed earlier in our laboratory [3,4].
A spiral cavity with a square cross-section was used for all experiments. The materials
used were virgin Nylon-6 and 35% short glass fiber-reinforced Nylon-6 composites.
Various processing variables were studied in terms of their influence on water penetration
behavior. Mechanical property tests were performed on the water-assisted injection
molded parts. X-ray diffraction has also been employed to identify the structural
parameters of the materials. In addition, the in-mold temperature distribution of the
polymeric materials during the cooling process was measured.

was stored in a tank with a temperature regulator for 30min to sustain an isothermal
water temperature.
Molding Machine and Molds
All experiments were conducted on an 80 ton conventional injection molding machine,
with a highest injection rate of 109 cm3/s. A spiral cavity with a square cross-section of
15mm 15mm was used for all experiments. Figure 3 shows the layout and dimension
of the mold. The temperature of the mold was regulated by a water-circulating mold
temperature control unit. After molding, the length of water penetration in molded parts
was measured. Various processing variables were studied in terms of their influence on
the penetration lengths in water channels of molded parts: melt temperature, mold
temperature, melt-filling speed and pressure, water temperature and pressure, water
injection delay time and hold time, and short-shot size of the polymer melt. Table 2 lists
these processing variables, as well as the values used in the experiments.
XRD Analysis
In order to analyze the crystal structure within the water-assisted injection molded parts,
wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) with 2D detector analyses in transmission mode was
performed with CuK radiation at 40 kV and 40mA. More specifically, the measurements
were performed on the mold-side, intermediate, and water-side layers of the water-assisted
injection molded parts, with the 2 angle ranging from 7–408. The samples required for
these analyses were taken from the center portion of the water-assisted injection molded
spiral parts. To obtain the desired thickness of the XRD samples, we removed the

the water is injected into the parts, it begins to cool the materials and increases
the viscosity of the melt significantly. It then becomes more difficult for the water
to penetrate into the core of the composites. On the other hand, due to the anisotropy
of the filling fibers, the temperature distribution of the materials may not be uniform
during the cooling process. Since the viscosity of the polymer melt strongly depends on
its temperature, a non-uniform temperature distribution may lead to differential
flow resistance for the water. Irregular water penetration may thus occur at the core of
the materials.
Effects of Processing Parameters on the Length of Water Penetration
It has been generally accepted that the sinkmark and warpage decrease with the length
of water penetration in molded parts. There is a need to understand the effects of
processing parameters on the water penetration length. In this study, various processing
variables were studied in terms of their influence on the water penetration behavior.
Table 2 lists these processing variables, as well as the values used in the experiments.
To mold the parts, one arbitrary processing condition was chosen as a reference (variable
in bold in Table 2). By changing one of the parameters in each test, we were better able to
understand the effect of each factor on the water penetration length in water-assisted
injection molded Nylon-6 composite parts. The reference processing condition selected for
35% glass fiber-reinforced Nylon was also listed in the parentheses in Table 2. After
molding, the lengths of water penetration were measured. Figure 6 shows the effects of
these processing parameters on the length of water penetration in molded composite parts,
including short-shot size, melt-fill speed, melt temperature, mold temperature, water
temperature, water injection delay time, water pressure, and water hold time.

shrinkage assumption of the same material, the less the water will penetrate in the
flow direction.
The experimental results in this study (Figure 6) suggested that water penetrates
further in virgin Nylon-6 than in glass fiber-filled Nylon-6 composites. This is due to the
fact that with the reinforcing glass fibers the composite materials have less volumetric
shrinkage during the cooling process. Therefore they mold parts with a shorter water
penetration length.
For the processing parameters used in the experiments, increasing the short-shot
size decreases the length of water penetration (Figure 6(a)). In water-assisted
injection molding, the mold cavity is partially filled with the polymer melt, followed
by the injection of water into the core of the polymer melt. Increasing the short-
shot size of the polymer melt therefore decreases the length of water penetration in
molded parts.
Filling the mold cavity as rapidly as possible should keep the polymer melt at high
temperatures for a longer time. It helps the water to push the materials against the mold
wall instead of penetrating further into the core of the parts. Molded parts thus exhibited
shorter water penetration lengths (Figure 6(b)).
The experimental results suggest that the melt temperature decreases the water
penetration in molded parts (Figure 6(c)). This might be due to the fact that increasing the
melt temperature decreases viscosity of the polymer melt. A lower viscosity of the
materials helps the water to pack the water channel and increase its void area, instead of
penetrating further into the parts. The hollow core ratio at the beginning of the water
channel increases, and the length of water penetration may thus decrease.
Increasing the mold temperature decreases the cooling rate as well as the viscosity of the
materials. The water then packs the channel and increases its void area near the beginning
of the water channel, instead of penetrating further into the parts. Molded Nylon
composite parts thus have a shorter water penetration length (Figure 6(d)). On the other
hand, a higher mold temperature also decreases the viscosity of the polymer melt. This will
help the water to further penetrate into the material and increase the water penetration
length (for virgin Nylon in Figure 6(d)).
Increasing the water temperature decreases the cooling rate of the materials and keeps
the polymer melt hot for a longer time. The viscosity of the materials decreases
accordingly. This will help the water penetrate further into the core of the parts, especially
for glass fiber-filled composite materials. On the other hand, a lower viscosity of the
virgin Nylon materials helps the water push the channel and increases its void area
near the beginning of the water channel, instead of penetrating further into the parts.
The water penetration length in molded polypropylene parts thus decreases for
virgin Nylon (Figure 6(e)).
This experimental result suggested that increasing the water injection delay
time increases the length of water penetration for the composite materials. This is
due to the increase in cooling time that results from increasing the water injection time.
The temperature distribution in molded parts is lower and the solidifying layer of
the polymer melt increases accordingly. The molded part has a smaller void area (hollowed
core ratio) at the beginning of the water channel. The water can thus penetrate further
(Figure 6(f )).
Increasing the water pressure helps the water penetrate into the materials. However,
if the pressure is too high, the water may push against the mold wall and decrease
the penetration length in molded parts (Nylon composites in Figure 6(g)).

Finally, increasing the water hold time increases the water penetration length.
In water-assisted injection molding, the water pressure acts as a holding pressure just
as in that of conventional injection molding. Increasing the water hold time keeps
the water at a high pressure for a longer time. This helps the water to penetrate further
into the core of the materials. The length of water penetration thus increases
(Figure 6(h)) [4].
Crystallinity of Molded Materials
Figure 7 shows the XRD patterns of the molded materials at the mold-side surface,
at the intermediate surface, and at the water-side surface. The processing condition used to
mold the parts was the variable in bold in Table 2. Based on the XRD pattern shown
in Figure 7(a), the resulting crystal morphology at the mold-side surface is dominated by
the g-phase crystals. This type of crystal structure is represented by the two distinct
peaks at 210.668 and 20.18, respectively. The small change in steepness shown at
2 ranging from 208 to 218 may be due to the minuscule amount of -phase crystal that
was present [9].
The crystal morphology at the intermediate layer is dominated by the -phase crystals
(Figure 7(b)). The representative peak for the g-phase crystal suddenly and substantially
decreases with increasing distance from the mold/part interface, which indicates
a reduction in the g-phase crystal population. This loss in g-phase crystals is replaced
by the growth of a -phase crystal, which is represented by the peaks at 2–208

suitable environment for the growth of -phase crystals, thereby triggering the
transformation of most of the -crystals into g-structures [9–11]. The materials at the
water-side layer experienced a cooling faster than that at the intermediate layer, but slower
than that at the mold-side layer. Two types of crystal structures (-phase crystal and
g-phase crystal) thus coexist in the materials.
Mechanical Properties of Molded Parts
Tensile tests were performed at room temperature on water-assisted injection molded
specimens to evaluate the effect of various processing parameters, including melt
temperature, mold temperature, and water temperature, on the tensile properties. The
tensile specimens were obtained with a specimen-milling machine, from parts molded with
different processing parameters. Five specimens were tested for each test trial.
The measured results in Figure 9 suggest that the yield strength of molded parts increases
with the mold temperature and decreases with the melt temperature, while the effect of
water temperature is relatively limited.
It has been reported [12] that the thickness of the fast cooling layer has a significant
influence on the mechanical properties of molded parts. A thicker and faster cooling layer
results in higher yield strength and lower elongation at yield. It was also reported that in
conventional injection molding the fast cooling layer decreases with the melt temperature.
The experimental results in this study showed that the yield strength of water-assisted
injection molded parts decreases with the melt temperature. This might be due to the

pressure is applied to the materials, the heat of the polymer melt can be transferred out to
either the water at the core or the mold at the surface. As the water pressure is removed,
the water may evaporate and bubbles may form between the parts and the water. This will
result in thermal resistance between the polymer melt and the water, which reduces the
heat transfer rate internally. On the other hand, the release of the water hold pressure may
also lead to some gap between the mold and the part. Additional thermal resistance
may thus form between the part and the mold, which in turn reduces the heat transfer rate
externally. Since the crystallization process of polymers is an exothermal process, the
reduction of the total cooling rates may lead to an increase of the temperature profiles as
the water pressure is removed. Nevertheless, as time passes, the heat will be conducted out
by the external mold and by the internal water. The temperatures decrease again gradually,
as shown in Figure 10.
CONCLUSIONS
This report has experimentally studied the water-assisted injection molding of glass
fiber-reinforced Nylon-6 composites. The following conclusions can be drawn based on
the current study:
1. Water-assisted injection molded composite parts exhibited rough internal surfaces
compared to those of virgin materials. Irregular water penetration was also observed
along the water channel in molded parts.
2. The length of water penetration in molded parts was found to decrease with short-shot
size, melt-fill speed, and melt temperature, and to increase with water pressure and
water hold time.
3. The g-phase crystals dominate the crystal morphology at the mold-side surface, while
the -phase crystals dominate the crystal morphology at the intermediate layers. On the
other hand, at the water-side surface, both the -phase crystal and the g-phase crystal
coexist.
4. The crystallinity of the material at the water-side layer was found to increase with the
water temperature.
5. The yield strength of molded parts increases with the mold temperature, but decreases
with the melt temperature. The effect of water temperature on the tensile properties of
molded parts was relatively limited.

polymer melt [2–5]. A schematic diagram of the water-assisted injection molding is
illustrated in Figure 1.
Water-assisted injection molding is taking hollow-part injection molding into territory
where gas-assisted [6–9] has never been before. It was first used in fluid-transport
applications where it proved able to provide smoother inner walls than gas. The
incompressibility, low cost, high cooling capacity, and ease of recycling of the water makes
it an ideal medium for the process. The application range of water-assisted injection
molding includes handles, clutch pedals, fascias, rocker covers, roof racks, door modules,
shovels, brackets, chairs, and office furniture.
Despite all the advantages associated with water-assisted injection molding, several key
problems have never been systematically investigated. One of them is the thickness
distribution in molded plastic tubes with dimensional transitions. Yang and Chou [10] and
Liu and Hsieh [11] respectively studied the gas-assisted and water-assisted injection
moldings of curved tubes and reported that the wall thickness is not uniform at transitions.
The thickness distribution as well as the hollowed core ratio in water-assisted injection
molded tubes strongly affects the mechanical property of molded parts. There is a need to
gain a better understanding of water-assisted injection molding of plastic tubes with
dimensional transitions.
This report was made to study, experimentally, the water-assisted injection molding of
plastic tubes with dimensional transitions. Experiments were carried out on an 80-ton
injection-molding machine equipped with a lab scale water injection system, which
included a water pump, a pressure accumulator, a water injection pin, a water tank
equipped with a temperature regulator, and a control circuit. The materials used for the
experiments included an amorphous polystyrene and a semi-crystalline polypropylene.
Two types of water injection pins, the orifice and the porous types, combined with two
‘‘float-shape’’ axisymmetric cavities were used to mold the plastic parts. After molding, the
hollowed core ratios of molded parts were measured. Various processing variables were
studied in terms of their influence on the moldability of water-assisted injection molded
parts: melt temperature, mold temperature, water temperature, water pressure, water
injection delay time and water hold time, and melt short shot size. The core-out geometries
in water-assisted injection molded parts were also compared to those in gas-assisted
injection molded products. By gaining a better understanding of water-assisted injection

molded polypropylene and polystyrene. The experimental results suggest that the porous
type water pin molds parts with the most uniform residual wall thickness distribution.
In addition, the porous water pin molds tubes with less residual wall thickness than the
gas pin.
Some irregular water penetration was observed in tubes molded by the orifice type water
pin. This is due to the fact that water has a higher cooling capacity and cools down the
parts faster than gas. During the molding process, as long as the water enters into the
cavity, it begins to cool the polymer melt and increases the viscosity of the melt
significantly. It then becomes more difficult for the water to penetrate the core of the parts
than for the gas, especially for the orifice type water pin which has a low flow rate and a
low discharge pressure. Water assisted injection molded parts may, thus, exhibit irregular
hollowed core ratios (irregular water penetration) along the water channel (Figure 5). On
the other hand, the difference of residual wall thickness in molded polypropylene was
measured and the result is shown in Figure 6(c). Again the orifice water pin, which had a
lower flow rate as well as a lower discharge pressure, molded tubes with the largest wall
thickness difference.
Plastic tubes molded by the d-4d-d cavity were also studied. Figure 7 shows the void
shapes of molded polypropylene tubes, while Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show the hollowed core

There are at least three factors that might affect the hollowed core ratios of molded
parts [3]. The first factor is the melt short shot size. In water-assisted injection molding, the
cavity is first partially filled by polymer melt followed by the injection of high-pressure
water for packing the materials. The higher the melt shot size, the less space is left for the
water to penetrate. The molded hollowed core ratios decrease accordingly. The second
factor is the shrinkage of the polymeric materials. During post-filling, the solidifying
polymer undergoes volumetric shrinkage, allowing water to penetrate into the parts for the
