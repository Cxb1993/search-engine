Abstract 
The interfacial reaction layers in the Ti/ZrO2 diffusion couples, isothermally annealed in argon at 
temperatures between 1100° and 1550°C for 6 hours, were characterized using scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both attached with an 
energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS).  Very limited reaction occurred between Ti and ZrO2 at 
1100°C.  A β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer and a two-phase α-Ti(O) + β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer were found in the 
titanium side after annealing at T≥ 1300ºC and T≥ 1400ºC, respectively.  A three-phase layer, 
consisting of Ti2ZrO + α-Ti(O, Zr) + β'-Ti (O, Zr), was formed after annealing at 1550°C.  In the 
zirconia side near the original interface, β'-Ti coexisted with fine spherical c-ZrO2-x, which 
dissolved a significant amount of Y2O3 in solid solution at T≥ 1300ºC.  Further into the ceramic 
side, the α-Zr was formed due to the exsolution of Zr out of the metastable ZrO2-x after annealing 
at T≥ 1300ºC: the α-Zr was very fine and dense at 1300ºC, continuously distributed along grain 
boundaries at 1400ºC, and became coarsened at 1550ºC.  The zirconia grains grew significantly 
at T≥ 1400ºC with the lenticular t-ZrO2-x being precipitated in c-ZrO2-x.  Finally, the 
microstructural development and diffusion paths in the Ti/ZrO2 diffusion couples annealed at 
various temperatures were also described by the aid of the Ti-Zr-O ternary phase diagram.

(2) SEM/EDS analyses 
An SEM (Model JSM-6330F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive 
spectrometer (EDS, Mode ISIS300, Oxford Instrument Inc., London, UK) was used for the 
microstructural observation on the interface between titanium and zirconia.  Both backscattering 
electron image (BEI) and secondary electron image (SEI) were acquired.  Cross-sectional 
specimens were cut into about 3 mm x 2 mm x 1 mm, and then ground and polished using 
diamond paste down to 1 µm.  The specimens for the SEI observation were etched by the Kroll 
reagent (10 ml HF + 30 ml HNO3 + 60 ml H2O) for 15 seconds.  In order to avoid electric 
charging under the electron beam, specimens were coated with a thin layer of platinum.   
 
(3) TEM/EDS analyses 
A TEM (Model JEM 2000Fx, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive 
spectrometer (EDS, Mode ISIS300, Oxford Instrument Inc., London, UK) was also employed for 
characterizing the interfacial microstructure between titanium and zirconia.  Cross-sectional 
TEM specimens perpendicular to the interface of titanium and zirconia were cut, ground, and 
polished by standard procedures as mentioned previously.11  The TEM specimens were dimpled 
and ion milled by a precision ion miller (Model 691, Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA).  The 
quantitative composition analyses were carried out based on the principle of the Cliff-Lorimer 
standardless technique.14   
 
III. Results and Discussion 
(1) Distinct microstructures at various temperatures  
The microstructure of the Ti/ZrO2 interface strongly depended on the annealing temperature.  
Figures 1(a)-(d) display the backscattered electron images (BEI) of the cross-section normal to 
the Ti/ZrO2 interface after annealing at 1100°, 1300°, 1400°, and 1550°C for 6 hours, 
respectively.  Titanium was in the left-hand side, while zirconia was in the other side.  The 
vertical arrows in the upper side of individual figures indicate the original interfaces of Ti and 
ZrO2.  The original interfaces were deliberately located by the results of characteristic Kα x-ray 
maps of yttrium (not shown) which was relatively immobile compared with elements Zr, O, and 
Ti.   
 
(A) The Reaction Layer “I” of the Ti/ZrO2 interface 
A gray thin layer (designated as the reaction layer “I”) was formed in the interface between Ti 
and ZrO2 at temperatures T≥ 1400oC as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).  The reaction layers “I” in 
Fig. 1(a) and (b) were invisible because of the limited resolution, however, they could be 
observed using SEM or TEM at a higher magnification [Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 3].  To the left of the 
reaction layer “I” is the α-Ti with oxygen in solid solution, designated as α-Ti(O) in this study.   
 
Figure 2 displays the secondary electron images (SEI) of the lamellar α-Ti (Zr, O) and Ti2ZrO in 
the reaction layer “I” etched by Kroll reagent (10 ml HF + 30 ml HNO3 + 60 ml H2O) after 
annealing at 1300°, 1400°, and 1550°C, respectively.  The thickness of the reaction layer “I” 
increased with temperature.  Figure 2 shows clearly, at a higher magnification, the very 
different microstructures developed at various anneal temperatures.  For example, the sequence 
of the reaction layers I + IV + …[Fig. 2(a)] was formed after annealing at 1300°C, while the 
sequence of the reaction layers I + III + … [Fig. 2(b)] and the sequence of the reaction layers I + 
II +… [Fig. 2(c)] are formed after annealing at 1400° and 1550°C, respectively.   
 
For the benefit of good resolution of TEM, a very thin reaction layer “I” was found in the 
Ti/ZrO2 interface after annealing at 1100°C for 6 h.  Figure 3(a) displays the TEM micrograph 
of the cross-section between Ti and ZrO2 after annealing at 1100oC for 6 h.  The arrow indicates 
the original interface with titanium and zirconia being in the upper and lower sides, respectively.  
Their morphologies were very different from those results in previous studies after annealing at 
1550º or 1700ºC.9, 11  The SADPs as shown in Fig. 3(b) indicates that the lamellar phases were 
 6
 
(F) The Reaction Layer “VI” of the Ti/ZrO2 interface 
At high temperatures, the oxidation-reduction reaction resulted in the formation of metastable 
oxygen deficient zirconia (ZrO2-x).  Then α-Zr would be excluded from this metastable ZrO2-x 
onto the grain boundaries of zirconia during the subsequent cooling.  In the layer “VI” as shown 
in Fig. 1(b)-(d), the α-Zr coexisted with tetragonal and/or cubic zirconia.  At 1300oC, the 
negligible grain growth of zirconia resulted in the very fine and dense α-Zr as shown in Fig. 1(b).  
For the sample after annealing at 1400oC, zirconia grains were delineated by the continuously 
distributed intergranular α-Zr [Fig. 1(c)], indicating a significant degree of grain growth.  In 
addition to the apparent grain growth of zirconia, the intergranular α-Zr was coarsened and 
became isolated, as shown in Fig. 1(d), after annealing at 1550oC.   
 
In the reaction layer “VI,” the oxidation-reduction reaction rather than dissolution is the 
predominant mechanism in the reaction layer “VI.”  The dissolution played an insignificant role 
toward the formation of the reaction layer “VI” since titanium was not detected by EDS in this 
layer.  Figures 5(a)-(d) show the bright field images (BFI) of the reaction layer “VI” after 
annealing at 1100°, 1300°, 1400°, 1550°C for 6 h, respectively.  After annealing at 1100°C/6 h, 
the limited reaction resulted in t-ZrO2-x, as it was in as hot-pressed samples, with no intergranular 
α-Zr and insignificant grain growth of zirconia [Fig. 5(a)].  At 1300°C/6 h, the t-ZrO2-x 
remained with a slight grain growth (grain size about 1~ 2 µm), while the dense fine α-Zr was 
formed by the exsolution of Zr from the metastable t-ZrO2-x [Fig. 5(b)].  After annealing at 
1400° or 1550°C, it was found that the lenticular t-ZrO2-x with two variants precipitated in the 
ordered c-ZrO2-x [Fig. 5(c) and (d)], which was stabilized by the extensive oxygen vacancies.  
The ordered c-ZrO2-x was recognized by the 1/5{113} superlattice reflections.  The grain sizes 
of zirconia after annealing at 1400º and 1550ºC were about 8-10 µm and 20-30 µm, respectively, 
indicating rapid grain growth on annealing.  
 
The microstructures of the reaction layer “VI” strongly depend upon annealing temperature in the 
following respects: (1) the grain growth of zirconia; (2) the exsolution of α-Zr onto the grain 
boundaries of zirconia; (3) the morphologies and crystal structures of zirconia.  The 
microstructural features of the reaction layer “VI” are summarized in Table I.  
 
It is also note that a large amount of the pores existed in the ceramic side after annealing at T≥ 
1300°C.  The formation of these pores was attributed to the Kirkendall effect, because 
zirconium and oxygen diffused to the titanium side much faster than titanium did toward the 
zirconia side in the opposite direction. 
 
(G) Formation of the Ti3O suboxide in α-Ti(O) 
In contrast to a limited diffusion range of zirconium (up to the reaction layer “I”), oxygen 
showed a relatively long diffusion range (well beyond the reaction layer “I”).  Rather than 
forming a distinct layer with a specific thickness, the oxygen concentration of α-Ti(O) decayed 
gradually across a wide region.  During cooling, the hexagonal phases of ordered titanium 
suboxides such as Ti2O, Ti3O, and possibly Ti6O might be formed within an extended range, as 
shown in the Ti-O phase diagram.15  In this study, only the ordered Ti3O resulted from the 
transformation of α-Ti(O) during cooling because of the extended reaction between titanium and 
zirconia at 1400º or 1550ºC.  However, no such a suboxide was found in those samples 
annealed at 1100° or 1300ºC. 
 
Figure 6 shows Ti3O contained stacking faults and dislocations in α-Ti(O) abutting the reaction 
layer “I” after annealing at 1550°C for 6 h.  Inset in the upper right corner was the SADP of the 
hexagonal Ti3O with the electron beam parallel to the zone axis of [1 2 10].  The superlattice 
reflections (0002), ( 1110 ), and ( 1220 ) indicated the cell dimension along the c axis of the 
superlattice should be twice of the Ti cell, but not three times as proposed by Jostsons and 
 8
various diffusion paths, it is worth noting that the two-phase α-Ti(Zr, O) + β-Ti(Zr, O) region, 
where the diffusion path passes through, is found neither at 1300° nor at 1400ºC.  This region is 
corresponding to the reaction layer “II” in Fig. 1(d), consisting of β'-Ti and the lamellar Ti2ZrO + 
α-Ti.  The microstructural development on annealing at 1550ºC and after subsequent cooling 
was described previously11, 13 and schematically shown in Fig. 7(d).   
 
According to the foregoing discussion, the reaction layers formed in the interface of titanium and 
zirconia at various temperatures can be summarized in Table II.  In brief, a very limited 
interfacial reaction took place at temperatures as low as 1100°C, merely leading to the formation 
of the α-Ti(O) and oxygen deficient zirconia t-ZrO2-x.  In the titanium side, a thin α-Ti(O) + 
Ti2ZrO layer (or layer I) existed after annealing at T≥ 1100ºC; the β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer (or layer IV) 
was formed after annealing at T≥ 1300ºC; a two-phase α-Ti(O) + β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer (or layer III) 
was observed after annealing at T≥ 1400ºC; and a three-phase Ti2ZrO + α-Ti(O, Zr) + β'-Ti (O, 
Zr) layer (or layer II) was found after annealing at 1550°C.  In the zirconia side near the original 
interface (or layer V), β'-Ti coexisted with fine spherical c-ZrO2-x, which dissolved a significant 
amount of Y2O3 in solid solution at T≥ 1300ºC.  Further into the ceramic side (or layer VI), the 
zirconia grains grew significantly with the lenticular t-ZrO2-x being precipitated in the c-ZrO2-x 
matrix at T≥ 1400ºC.  However, no cubic zirconia was found in the reaction layer “VI” after 
annealing at 1100º or 1300oC.  The exsolution of Zr out of the metastable ZrO2-x led to the 
formation of α-Zr, which was very fine and dense after annealing at 1300ºC, continuously 
distributed along grain boundaries at 1400ºC, and became coarsened at 1550ºC.  It is also noted 
that the suboxide Ti3O was found in the α-Ti(O), to the left of the reaction layer “I,” after 
annealing at 1400º and 1550ºC, while an ordered β'-Ti(Zr, O) phase existed in the reaction layer 
“V” after annealing at 1550ºC.  
 
IV. Conclusions 
1. The diffusional reactions between titanium and zirconia were carried out isothermally in argon 
at temperatures ranging from 1100° to 1550°C for 6 hours.  It was found that the 
microstructure in the Ti/ZrO2 interface strongly depended on the annealing temperature.   
2. In the titanium side, a thin α-Ti(O) + Ti2ZrO layer (or layer I) existed after annealing at T≥ 
1100ºC; the β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer (or layer IV) was formed after annealing at T≥ 1300ºC; a 
two-phase α-Ti(O) + β'-Ti(Zr, O) layer (or layer III) was observed after annealing at T≥ 
1400ºC; and a three-phase Ti2ZrO + α-Ti(O, Zr) + β'-Ti (O, Zr) layer (or layer II) was found 
after annealing at 1550°C.  
3. In the zirconia side near the original interface, β'-Ti coexisted with fine spherical c-ZrO2-x, 
which dissolved a significant amount of Y2O3 in solid solution at temperatures ranging from 
1300º to 1550ºC, due to the reaction enhanced dissolution mechanism.   
4. Further into the ceramic side, the zirconia grain grew significantly at 1400º and 1550ºC.  α-Zr 
was excluded out of the metastable ZrO2-x after annealing T≥ 1300ºC: α-Zr was densely 
distributed along with t-ZrO2-x at 1300ºC, continuously located at 1400ºC, and became 
coarsened at 1550ºC.  The lenticular t-ZrO2-x was precipitated in c-ZrO2-x after annealing at 
1400° and 1550ºC, while the limited reaction resulted in t-ZrO2-x as it was in as-hot pressed 
samples after annealing at 1100º or 1300°C.   
5. Finally, the microstructural development in the Ti/ZrO2 annealed at various temperatures was 
described by the aid of the Ti-Zr-O ternary phase diagram.
