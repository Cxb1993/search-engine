Motivation and goal 
In the last few years, biological literature describing disease candidate genes with putative 
aberrant methylation has been published exponentially. It is necessary to automatically 
summarize the literature and uncover potentially meaningful relations among genes, methylation 
and cancers. However, so far no attempt has been made to analyze and retrieve the available 
DNA methylation information, especially disease candidate genes, in a great deal of literature. 
The goal of this study is to develop a database system, MeInfoText, for providing information as 
follows: (1) comprehensive association information about gene methylation and cancer, (2) the 
profile of gene methylation among human cancer types and (3) the gene methylation profile of a 
specific cancer type, based on association mining from large amounts of literature. In addition, 
MeInfoText offers integrated protein-protein interaction and biological pathway information and 
provides pathway cluster information regarding to a set of abnormal methylated genes. 
MeInfoText may be applied to infer the pathways responsible for the development of tumors in a 
specific tissue. The database will complement existing DNA methylation information and will be 
useful in epigenetics research and the prevention of cancer.   
Related work 
MethDB [15] is the only public database that was developed to store information containing the 
origin of the investigated sample, including experimental procedure and DNA methylation data. 
In addition, Toshihide Ono et al. described a method for automatically extracting information on 
protein-protein interaction from text sources. Their method circumvents the complexities of 
natural language processing (NLP) techniques by focusing on a particular area of interest 
(protein-protein interactions) and using only simple rules for information extraction [11]. A 
rule-based phosphorylation information extraction system, RLIMS-P, were developed and 
implemented to connect and merge pieces of information about phosphorylation mentioned in 
 4
Gene Synonym Dictionary 
We constructed a human gene synonym dictionary containing official gene symbols and aliases to 
annotate gene names in the literature. The process was based on pattern matching between the 
dictionary entries and words in abstracts. The match was case-insensitive and only whole words 
were matched. After the complete of initial identification, we manually examined most recent 100 
gene-annotated documents to reduce false named entity recognitions and enhance dictionary 
coverage. If unexpected words were frequently matched in the documents, these ambiguous gene 
synonyms would be regarded as stop words and removed from the dictionary. On the other hand, 
if no gene synonym was able to be found in the document by the dictionary, the document would 
be checked manually and then the discovered gene synonyms, if any, would be added to our 
dictionary. We then annotated gene names in the literature again with the improved dictionary.  
Information Retrieval 
The gene-annotated documents were indexed with Plucene module, a perl search engine toolkit 
based on the Lucene API (http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene), to allow fast access to words stored 
inside the text. The associations between genes, methylation and cancers were mined according 
to their co-occurrences in the full abstracts and sentences. The keywords for methylation include 
‘methyl-’, ‘hypermethyl-’, ‘hypomethyl-’, ‘histone’ and the methods of detecting DNA 
methylation, such as ‘MSP’ and ‘COBRA’.  
We used confidence and support to measure our association rule interestingness. Confidence is 
the frequency of entries containing item A within all entries containing item B. Support is the 
frequency of entries containing item A and B within all entries. For example, Let G = 
{ i21 Gene,...,Gene,Gene } be a set of gene items and C = { j21 Cancer,...,Cancer,Cancer } be a set of 
cancer items. The confidence and support of “Genei methylation => Cancerj” association rule are 
as 
follows.
 6
clusters and interactions of these genes. In the page of “Interaction Information about Gene 
Methylation and Cancer”, the interaction network could be retrieved by following the link of 
Graph. Each node represents a gene, the red one represents the query gene such as BRCA1 and 
the blue ones represent other genes related to methylation. Each edge means an interaction 
between two genes. Specific association information and evidence extracted from the literature 
can be accessed by following the link of the number of papers containing gene, methylation and 
cancer. The information extracted from the literature is presented with highlighted keywords, 
identified genes, journal names and publication years. 
To find gene methylation profile of human cancer, users may select a particular cancer type such 
as Breast cancer to find a set of genes undergoing abnormal methylation shared by this cancer. In 
addition, users can enter multiple official gene symbols separated by space to access gene 
methylation associations. For example, users are able to input ‘BRCA1 APC CDKN2A GSTP1’ 
to simultaneously retrieve association information including the number of related papers, 
confidences and supports. Users also can input multiple official gene symbols separated by space 
and select multiple cancer types to examine the profile of gene methylation across human cancer 
types. For instance, if a set of genes, including APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), BRCA1, 
CDH1 (cadherin 1), GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi), MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA 
methyltransferase) and TIMP3 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3), are inputted and different 
cancer types, including colon, lung, breast, gastric, liver, esophageal, bladder, leukemia, kidney, 
ovarian, head and neck, pancreas and lymphoma are selected, the profile of methylation for each 
gene among different cancers could be shown. Users may find the profile is cancer-specific or 
gene-specific. 
Inference of the pathways responsible for the development of tumors in a specific tissue 
In addition to allow users to understand quickly the cancers in which a specific gene may play a 
role, MeInfoText could infer the pathways responsible for the development of cancers. If a set of 
genes could be associated to a given disease, they may tend to be connected at the translational 
 8
vs. lymphoma” or “squamous cell lung cancer vs. lung cancer”). The precision and recall of 
cancer name recognitions are 79% and 67%. 
We tested our association rules using human gene methylation and cancer data published by Das 
and Singal, 2004 [22] and Esteller, 2005 [3]. In addition, human genes having methylation 
information and available in MethDB were also tested. First, the ratios of relationships between 
gene methylation and cancer that could be discovered by MeInfoText are 13/13 (100%), 34/36 
(94%) and 18/18 (100%). Second, the average confidences and supports for the three test sets are 
(61.3%, 17.1%) and (60.6%, 17.5%) and (54.4%, 16.2%). We observed that over 85% and 90% 
of the tested genes have confidences and supports greater than 40% and 7%, respectively. 
Therefore, we believed rules that satisfy a minimum confidence threshold, 40%, and a minimum 
support threshold, 7%, in this study are significant.  
We evaluated the 75 associations in relation to the 34 unique genes and specific cancers from Das 
and Singal, 2004 and Esteller, 2005. The data used for the evaluation can be assessed at 
http://mit.lifescience.ntu.edu.tw/mit_test_data.html. Mined associations with no explicit 
evidences that can support it were regarded as false positives. The precision and recall of 
association mining are 99% and 93%, respectively. Furthermore, we randomly selected 20 genes, 
PYCARD, CDH13, COX2, DAPK1, ESR1, GATA4, SYK, MLH1, TP73, PRDM2, PGR, SFRP1, 
SOCS1, SOCS3, STK11, TMEFF2, THBS1, RASSF5, PRKCDBP and RARB, from the 34 genes 
and manually evaluated the mined associations with at least 2, 3 and 5 papers, respectively. The 
number of the associations is 362, 222 and 103 and precisions are 78%, 85% and 91%. 
MeInfoText might provide methylation markers for the detection of human cancer. From the 
MeInfoText search, we can find gene methylation profile of almost every human cancer type. The 
most relevant methylation-associated silencing of genes for each cancer could be combined into a 
set of potential markers which may reach high cancer detection information. For example, there 
are 342 genes whose abnormal methylation might relate to lung cancer and the top 11 genes 
having at least 20 papers include CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), RASSF1

Project achievement estimation 
We successfully developed a text mining-based database system called MeInfoText as we 
expected in this research project. The manuscript about this study has been submitted to ‘BMC 
Bioinformatics’ and is in revision. The research content fits in with the proposed project in most 
aspects. Parts of the experiment methods described in the project were modified as follows. More 
various data were collected and integrated. A human gene synonym dictionary was constructed to 
annotate gene names in the literature. The associations between genes, methylation and cancers 
were mined according to their co-occurrences in the full abstracts and sentences and we used 
confidence and support to measure our association rule interestingness. The gene synonym 
dictionary, cancer names and mined associations were evaluated respectively. We didn’t apply 
machine learning approach to this study. 
We reached more than the anticipated goal. MeInfoText can be accessed by gene symbols, 
gene-related keywords and cancer names to find information about (1) genes, (2) associations 
among genes, methylation and cancers, (3) interacting partners, (4) biological pathways, (5) the 
profile of gene methylation across human cancer types, (6) gene methylation profile of a specific 
cancer type, and (7) extracted evidences from existing literature. The association rules generated 
by our text mining have high precisions. The web interface is friendly for users to access and the 
search results are organized and clear at a glance. The interaction networks also could be 
represented as graphs. In addition, MeInfoText could infer the pathways responsible for the 
development of cancers. Furthermore, MeInfoText might provide methylation markers for the 
detection of human cancer. From the MeInfoText search, we can find gene methylation profile of 
almost every human cancer type. The most relevant methylation-associated silencing of genes for 
each cancer could be combined into a set of potential markers which may reach high cancer 
detection information.

Background
DNA methylation, occurring predominantly in CpG dinucleotides, is an important
epigenetic modification of the genome that is involved in mediating various cellular
processes [1]. DNA methylation has a wide range of biological functions, including an
essential developmental role in the reprogramming of germ cells and early embryos, the
genomic imprinting, the X chromosome inactivation, the repression of endogenous
retrotransposons and the generalized role in gene expression [2]. Abnormal
methylation of DNA may result in increased transcription of oncogenes or silencing of
tumor suppressor genes and is common in a variety of human cancer cells [3]. Although
the ramifications of global hypomethylation for tumor development are less well
understood, it might contribute to chromosomal instability and then increases in gene
expression [4, 5]. The hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene promoter regions is
associated with aberrant silencing of transcription and has been regarded as a common
mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancer [3, 6]. As
compared with normal cells, the malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA
methylation patterns [7] and some genes seem to be aberrantly methylated in a
tumor-specific manner [2]. Currently, many studies have corroborated the DNA
methylation profile of a cell type which may serve as a biomarker with a diagnostic and
prognostic value [8]. In addition, the initiation of the process of abnormal promoter
methylation may associate with chromatin-remodelling complexes [5, 9]. Therefore, if
the contribution of each candidate gene to tumorigenesis can be proved, the exact
methylation profiles of tumors are available and the molecular events that initiate and
maintain epigenetic gene silencing are understood clearly, then the prevention and
treatment of cancer could have come more focused and rational [5, 10].

MeInfoText is a relational database implemented by MySQL and Perl programming
language in the Linux environment. Figure 1 shows the simplified relational scheme of
our database. For example, each human gene in our database may associate with one or
many cancers due to abnormal gene methylation, such as hypermethylation. Each
association could be referred to more than one known evidences extracted from the
biomedical literature.
MeInfoText contains associations among human genes, methylation and cancers and
integrated information about protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. The
general human gene information, including official gene symbol, aliases, description
and function was retrieved from NCBI Entrez Gene [20]. At present, 13156 human
genes are available in our database. The protein-protein interaction data was collected
from HPRD [21] and IntAct [22]. It provides information on interacting partners,
interaction types and detection methods. The biological pathway information collected
from HPRD and KEGG [23] describes pathway types, regulations for genes, and
experiments. The gene methylation-related pathway cluster information is
automatically generated using literature mining results and known pathway data.
Cancer types were obtained from the medical subject headings vocabulary (MeSH). All
association information was mined from MEDLINE abstracts collected through
PubMed with query terms including human, methylation and cancer. Figure 2 shows
our text mining approach and information integration for constructing MeInfoText.
Gene Synonym Dictionary
We constructed a human gene synonym dictionary containing official gene symbols
and aliases to annotate gene names in the collected texts. The process was based on

Utility
Query method
MeInfoText can be accessed by gene symbols, gene-related keywords and cancer
names to find information about genes, associations among genes, methylation and
cancers, interacting partners, biological pathways, the profile of gene methylation
across human cancer types, gene methylation profile of a specific cancer type, and
extracted evidences from existing literature. In this study, the profiles of gene
methylation mean the patterns of frequency of gene methylation that is primarily
represented by the number of related literature. Figure 3 shows the search interface and
various features of MeInfoText.
In order to retrieve gene methylation and cancer information regarding the human
BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset) gene, for example, users can specify ‘Gene
Symbol’ search type, input BRCA1 as search term and then press the MIT search
button. If the search is matched, the general gene information, including Gene ID,
Swiss Prot accession number, Gene Name, Gene Aliases and Description, is shown.
Users can then follow the NCBI Entrez Gene ID link for statistics and association
information. The returned web page contains information about gene function,
cross-references, association between BRCA1 gene methylation and cancer in sentence
level, protein-protein interactions, biological pathways and statistics, including the
numbers of papers and sentences containing gene methylation, hypermethylation,
hypomethylation, histone and stem cell. Users can follow the link of “Does the gene
encode a methyltransferase?” to tell if a gene encodes a methyltransferase by support
 9
instance, if a set of genes, including APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), BRCA1,
CDH1 (cadherin 1), GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase pi), MGMT
(O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) and TIMP3 (TIMP metallopeptidase
inhibitor 3), are inputted and different cancer types, including colon, lung, breast,
gastric, liver, esophageal, bladder, leukemia, kidney, ovarian, head and neck, pancreas
and lymphoma are selected, the profile of methylation for each gene among different
cancers could be shown. Users may find the profile is cancer-specific or gene-specific.
Inference of the pathways responsible for the development of tumors in a specific
tissue
In addition to allow users to understand quickly the cancers in which a specific gene
may play a role, MeInfoText could infer the pathways responsible for the development
of cancers. If a set of genes could be associated to a given disease, they may tend to be
connected at the translational levels. In other words, their gene products may interact
with each other and involve in a biological pathway. For example, MeInfoText allows
the user to query for APC gene and shows the cancers in which the gene may be
methylated. Also, it shows the other genes that may be methylated for each of those
cancers. In the 70 papers that mention APC gene methylation and colorectal cancer,
there are 10 papers mentioning MLH1 (mutL homolog 1), 7 papers mentioning TP53
(tumor protein p53) and 3 papers mentioning MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral
oncogene homolog), all of which could be clustered into colorectal cancer pathway.
Furthermore, TP53, CTNNB1 (catenin, beta 1), MYC and SFRP1 (secreted
frizzled-related protein 1) are able to be clustered into Wnt signaling pathway and the
interaction data indicates CTNNB1 has physical and direct interaction with APC.
Therefore, users may infer abnormal methylation of these genes involve colorectal

the average confidences and supports for the three test sets are (61.3%, 17.1%) and
(60.6%, 17.5%) and (54.4%, 16.2%). We observed that over 85% and 90% of the tested
genes have confidences and supports greater than 40% and 7%, respectively. Therefore,
we believed rules that satisfy a minimum confidence threshold, 40%, and a minimum
support threshold, 7%, in this study are significant.
We evaluated the 75 associations in relation to the 34 unique genes and specific cancers
from Das and Singal, 2004 and Esteller, 2005. The data used for the evaluation can be
assessed at http://mit.lifescience.ntu.edu.tw/mit_test_data.html. Mined associations
with no explicit evidences that can support it were regarded as false positives. The
precision and recall of association mining are 99% and 93%, respectively. Furthermore,
we randomly selected 20 genes, PYCARD, CDH13, COX2, DAPK1, ESR1, GATA4,
SYK, MLH1, TP73, PRDM2, PGR, SFRP1, SOCS1, SOCS3, STK11, TMEFF2,
THBS1, RASSF5, PRKCDBP and RARB, from the 34 genes and manually evaluated
the mined associations with at least 2, 3 and 5 papers, respectively. The number of the
associations is 362, 222 and 103 and precisions are 78%, 85% and 91%.
MeInfoText might provide methylation markers for the detection of human cancer.
From the MeInfoText search, we can find gene methylation profile of almost every
human cancer type. The most relevant methylation-associated silencing of genes for
each cancer could be combined into a set of potential markers which may reach high
cancer detection information. For example, there are 342 genes whose abnormal
methylation might relate to lung cancer and the top 11 genes having at least 20 papers
include CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), RASSF1 (Ras association
domain family 1), TP53, MGMT, DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1), RARB
(retinoic acid receptor, beta), HRAS (v-Ha-ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene

methylation among human cancer types and gene methylation profile of a particular
cancer type. It would be useful to discover a set of potential markers for the detection of
human cancer. Thirdly, MeInfoText provides integrated information about
protein-protein interaction and biological pathway. Users can quickly overview which
genes with aberrant methylation may contribute a cancer through various signaling
pathways.
Future developments
Future research might focus on database content and dictionary coverage increases. In
addition, we would like to apply machine learning or other NLP techniques to do DNA
methylation information extraction and compare the results with the study.
Conclusion
MeInfoText is a novel database providing gene methylation and cancer association
information from literature mining and integrated protein-protein interaction and
pathway information. It facilitates researchers to comprehensively understand the
relationships between multiple gene methylation and various cancers, the profile of
gene methylation across human cancer types and gene methylation profile of a specific
cancer, and to infer putative signaling pathways involving the development of tumors.
It will complement existing DNA methylation information and be valuable to
epigenetics research and the prevention of cancer.

Figure 1. The simplified relational scheme of MeInfoText. Each gray box represents
an entity with various major attributes characterized by oval-shape. For instance, each
human gene may contribute to one or more cancers due to abnormal methylation, have
many interacting partners and involve several signaling pathways. Each association
between gene methylation and cancer could be referred to one or more evidences.
Figure 2. The text mining approach and information integration for MeInfoText.
Literature about human, methylation and cancer is collected from PubMed and
annotated with gene symbols. The most recent 100 gene-annotated abstracts are
manually checked to reduce false named entity recognitions and enhance dictionary
coverage. The gene-annotated documents are indexed with Plucene module and then
mined according to the frequencies of co-occurrences of entities. Various association,
protein-protein interaction and pathway information are stored in the relational
database, MeInfoText. Users can search the database via the web interface. Thick arrow
indicates the basic workflow of MeInfoText.
Figure 3. The search interface and various features of MeInfoText. The central box
represents the MeInfoText search interface composed of four categories, (1) search for
associations among gene, methylation and cancer, (2) multiple searches for gene
methylation associations, (3) multiple searches for the profile of gene methylation
across human cancer types and (4) search for gene methylation of a specific cancer type.
The major search results are shown around. Literature evidences with highlighted
keywords could also be retrieved.

Abstract in The sixth annual Emerging Information Technology Conference (EITC-06), Dallas, 
USA, Aug 10-12. (Oral presentation) 
researchers to achieve the goal. In general, abstracts of 
scientific publications are the most widely used sources of 
information because they contain a concise description of 
the most important information carried by a paper. However, 
current retrieval systems for the scientific literature are 
based on keyword searches and results usually take the form 
of long and not always informative lists of abstracts [5]. 
Furthermore, so far no attempt has been made to analyze the 
available DNA methylation information from a vast amount 
of literature. 
In this paper, we present a system for the extraction and 
mining of DNA methylation information in the text, 
particularly for discovering the relationships between genes 
and cancers. The system attempts to extract the fact that 
aberrantly methylated gene may result in cancer and 
analyze the association between gene methylation and 
cancer. Our system is based on pre-specific rules on 
document categorization, gene name recognition, fact 
extraction and analysis of association.  
II. METHODS 
Our system was developed with Perl programming 
language in the Linux environment. We first collected gene 
synonym information and selected text corpus from 
PubMed. We then constructed a gene synonym dictionary 
and improved its quality in an iterative way. This dictionary 
was used to identify and annotate gene synonyms in the text. 
Annotated documents were indexed and analyzed to extract 
DNA methylation information. The associations between 
gene methylation and cancer were mined according to their 
co-occurrence in the sentences.  
Our approach for identification of gene synonym in the 
text was based on the dictionary derived from NCBI Entrez 
Gene [6]. The dictionary contains human gene official 
symbols and their gene aliases, if available. We first used 
the initial dictionary to find gene names in the abstracts 
collected through PubMed with query terms including 
human, methylation and cancer. The process was based on 
pattern matching between the dictionary entries and words 
in abstracts. After the complete of initial identification, we 
manually and randomly examined 10 identified documents. 
If any unexpected words were matched in the documents, 
these would be regarded as stop words and added to the stop 
list. On the other hand, if no gene symbol was able to be 
found in the document, it would be examined manually and 
then the discovered gene symbols would be added to our 
dictionary. The process of gene identification was iterative 
until there was no unexpected word matched in the 
randomly selected identified documents and no gene names 
in unidentified documents. In most cases, the orthographical 
variations, such as GATA1 to GATA-1 and p16INK4 to 
p16INK4a, result in that gene names couldn’t be identified. 
We dealt with the gene-annotated abstracts in an 
indexing way and it can allow fast random access to words 
stored inside the text. Each abstract was parsed to extract 
information about title, journal, the body, publication date 
and PubMed ID. Apart from the body and title of an abstract, 
the quality of a journal and publication date may assist 
researchers to assess the evidences in the text. The hash data 
structure was employed to represent above information and 
the indexing procedure was performed with Plucene module, 
a perl search engine toolkit based on the Lucene API. 
Our analysis of DNA methylation information in the text 
was hierarchical. From each paper to sentence, various 
conditions were taken into account and applied. First, each 
paper was parsed to recognize the DNA methylation 
information. The rule was based on the co-occurrence of 
gene synonyms and the prefix of methylation-related 
keywords like methyl-, hypermethyl- and hypomethyl-. 
precisions are 97.8%, 94.5% and 92.0%, respectively, when 
support (%) is higher than 7% and numbers of related 
papers are greater than 20, 10 and 7, respectively. 
To understand if genes with abnormal methylation have 
similar functions such as DNA binding, transcription 
activity and/or cell proliferation so that their changes in 
expression level leads to cancers, the true positives were 
then assigned bottom Gene Ontology terms via Swiss-Prot 
and clustered functionally. The results suggested that gene 
functions may not strongly associate with the relationships 
between gene methylation and cancer. No any function 
cluster accounts for over 50% and only the ‘protein binding’ 
cluster accounts for over 35%. Nevertheless, some gene 
function clusters were significantly related to gene 
expression and cancer formation such as nucleus (22.8%), 
regulation of transcription activity (19.6%), cell 
proliferation (19.6%) and cell cycle (15.2%). 
IV. CONCLUSION 
We successfully developed a system to automatically 
extract gene methylation information in the text and 
associate the relationships between gene methylation and 
cancer. The test results showed the relationship between 
specific gene methylation and cancer can be mined with 
high precision. 
Our system is presently the only text-mining system for 
DNA methylation. It facilitates researchers to 
comprehensively browse all methylation-related 
experimental methods or results of specific genes through 
sentences extracted from literature abstracts. Furthermore, it 
provides the associations between human gene methylation 
and various cancers by analysis of large amounts of 
literature. This system will complement existing DNA 
methylation information and be valuable to epigenetics 
research.

Keyword: Ganoderma lucidum; polysaccharides; microarray; gene network; THP1; 
molecular regulation 
Abstract: 
Ganoderma lucidum has been widely used as an herbal medicine for promoting health 
and longevity in China and other Asian countries. Polysaccharide extracts from 
Ganoderma lucidum has been reported to exhibit immuno-modulating and anti-tumor 
activities. We purified the active components of the polysaccharide extracts by gel 
filtration chromatography and designated it as F3. The major carbohydrate 
components in F3 are glucose, mannose and galactose. In our study, F3 can activate 
many cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12B, IL-8 and TNF-α in human THP-1 
mononuclear cells. This gives rise to the question of how F3 does stimulate 
immuno-modulating and anti-tumor effects in THP-1 cells. Moreover, understanding 
the molecular mechanism underlying the F3 exertion in THP-1 cells is also of 
considerable importance. In order to do so, we used microarray, real-time quantitative 
PCR and bioinformatics methods to study the F3-induced effects on THP-1 cells. In 
the microarray data analysis, we identified the differentially disturbed pathways with 
statistical significance based on Fisher’s exact test and false discovery rate. The 
pathway of apoptosis induction through the DR3 and DR4/5 death receptors is shown 
to be very significant and important in F3-treated THP-1 cells. With time-series gene 
expression measurements and our developed software GeneNetwork and BSIP, we
