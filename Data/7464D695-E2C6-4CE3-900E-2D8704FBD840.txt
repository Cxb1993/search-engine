demonstrated to be as effective as using 
PEI/DNA complexes (You and Peng 2004). 
Although gene delivery efficiency attained 
by Ca-alginate nanoparticles was promising, 
it is limited by fairly narrow transparent 
microemulsion domain for large-scale 
process. In the study, we showed that the 
reverse microemulsion region can be easily 
enlarged using water-soluble chitosan (with 
MW of 12 kDa). This low-molecular-weight 
chitosan endowed with positive charges was 
entangled with negatively-charged plasmid 
bearing with enhanced green fluorescent 
protein (EGFP) gene, then formed 
chitosan/DNA nanodroplets using reverse 
microemulsion as a template. To acquire 
solid nanoparticles, anionic alginate was first 
added into the microemulsion solution to 
adsorb around the chitosan/DNA 
nanodroplets via electrostatic attractions, and 
followed by the formation of Ca-alginate gel 
using Ca2+ ion as the crosslinking agent. A 
plenthora of chitosan-polyanion complexes 
have been investigated as drug delivery 
carriers (Lee et al 1998; Borchard 2001; 
Angelova and Hunkeler 2001; Maurstad and 
Stokke 2004). Among them, preparation of 
chitosan and alginate complex via 
electrostatic interaction is widely used one 
(Mi et al 2002; De and Robinson 2003; 
Zhang et al 2004; Douglas and Tabrizian 
2005).  
SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1) is 
conserved NAD- dependent deacetylase that 
regulates life span in accordance with 
nutritional provision. In mammalian cells, 
SIRT1 also down-regulates stress-induced 
p53 pathways for apoptosis, thus favoring 
survival under stress. For this purpose we 
used synthetic small interfering RNA to 
silence SIRT1 gene expression by RNA 
interference (RNAi). Silencing SIRT1 
expression in malignant cells could facilitate 
apoptosis under stress (Imai et al 2000; 
Guarent 2000). Since 293T cell has high 
level expression of SIRT1, it is used as the 
model for this study. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Materials 
Chitosan (DD=93.3%, MW 12 kDa) was 
purchased from a local Taiwanese company. 
Sodium alginate (medium viscosity), 
isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane), AOT 
(sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate), 
and calcium chloride were purchased from 
Sigma. 
 
Fabrication of Chitosan/Alginate Core-Shell 
Nanoparticles. The detailed scheme is shown 
in Figure 1. First, 0.25 g of AOT was 
dissolved into a vial pre-filled with 15 mL of 
isooctane. 50 μL of 1% chitosan was mixed 
with 1 μg plasmid for 1 h. Then, 50 μL of 
chitosan/plasmid complexes were added 
dropwise into the vial with a micropipette 
under magnetic stirring. 10 μL of 0.5 % 
alginate was added into the vial for 10 min. 
The mixture was vortexed and waited for 
10min prior to the addition of 2 mL of 
filtered calcium chloride solution (2 % by 
weight) for obtaining alginate/chitosan 
core-shell nanoparticles. After carefully 
washed with acetone and deionized water to 
remove all residual AOT and isooctane, the 
vial was centrifuged (45,000 ×g) for 30 min 
and small white pellet of material was 
obtained. The obtained nanoparticles and 1 
mL of EDC/NHS (2:1 by molar ratio) 
dissolved in 1 ml deionized water were 
mixed for 2h under magnetic stirring. Then, 
50 μL of lucifer yellow (25μg) was added 
into the vial for 9~12 h. After washed with 
deionized water to clean the surface of 
modified nanoparticles, the vial was 
centrifuged (45,000 × g) for 30 min and 
small white pellet of material was obtained. 
After repeating the prior procedure for two 
times, the obtained nanoparticles were 
filtered by a 0.22 μm filter.  
 
Size Analysis of Chitosan/Alginate Core- 
Shell Nanoparticles. The prepared 
nanoparticles were re-suspended with 
dieonized water. The size of prepared 
chitosan/alginate core-shell nanoparticles 
were analysis by the dynamic light scattering 
(Nano ZS, Malvern, UK). 
 
Endocytosis of Chitosan/Alginate Core- Shell 
Nanoparticles. 293T cells were used to 
explore the fate of chitosan/alginate 
 4
Ca2+). As shown in Fig. 3, the particle size 
distribution of chitosan/alginate 
nanoparticles spanned from 59.1 to 144.5 nm 
with 50 to 80 μl of 12 kDa chitosan.  
 
Endocytosis. The swollen feature of 
alginate-based nanoparticles in transport 
vesicles was illustrated by fluorescent dye 
conjugated on alginate ingredient of 
nanoparticles (Fig. 4). Compared to the 
pictures of 24 and 72 h after cell endocytosis 
of nanoparticles labeled with lucifer yellow, 
the nanoparticles for 72 h post-addition were 
much bigger than that for 24 h post-addition. 
This is probably due to the erosion of 
Ca-alginate shell of the nanoparticles which 
led to the concentration of macromolecule 
(i.e., alginate) increase in the endosome 
causing the water in cytoplasm flowing in. 
The phenomenon would facilitate the escape 
of DNA plasmids to quickly release from 
endosomes and undergo transfection 
processes. 
 
Enhancing SIRT1 Silencing rate. SIRT1 
silence in 293T cells using the fabricated 
nanoparticles was demonstrated via Western 
blot analysis. Fig. 5 revealed that the band of 
SIRT1-siRNA was silenced, compared to the 
control and mock. It should be noted that the 
cell growth and morphology were not 
affected due to the addition of nanoparticles 
encapsulated with siRNA-SIRT1 plasmids. 
 
Conclusion 
Chitosan/alginate core-shell nanoparticles 
were made using water-in-oil reverse 
microemulsion template. Such biocompatible 
and biodegradable nanoparticles were used to 
encapsulate plasmid DNA and siRNA for 
gene delivery via cell endocytosis pathway. 
After the entrance of DNA-entrapped 
chitosan/alginate core-shell nanoparticles, 
erosion of Ca-alginate shell from the 
nanoparticle was occurred through 
sequestering calcium ions by phosphate ions 
within the transport vesicles. By the method 
of core-shell nanoparticles, SIRT1-siRNA 
plasmid was efficiently delivered to 293T 
cells and led to SIRT1 gene silence.
