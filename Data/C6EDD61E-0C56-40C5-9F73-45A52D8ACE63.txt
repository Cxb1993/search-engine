(一)中文摘要： 
本研究運用數位全像術提出一項嶄新的全像重建方式，實驗的結果顯
示在重建過程中僅需一張數位化的全相片即可。本文提出之單一曝光法的
其中一項優點是所使用的光學系統對抗外在雜訊干擾的能力較強，包含震
動及週遭環境的變化，這些在傳統相移數位全像術的架構下所使用的多次
曝光過程是不可避免的。此外另一個優點是既使在物光光強不均勻的狀況
下零階影像仍能被有效消除。 
(二)英文摘要： 
This work proposes a novel approach for holographic reconstruction that uses 
single-shot digital holography. Experiment results reveal that only one digital 
hologram is required for reconstruction. One of the advantages of the proposed 
single-shot approach is that the optical system is robust against external noise 
factors, including vibration and ambient fluctuation, which inevitably occur in a 
conventional phase-shifting digital holographic–based scheme that employs 
multiple exposures. The other advantage is that the zero order image still can be 
suppressed even if the object wave intensity is not uniform. 
(三)報告內容： 
1.Introduction: 
Gabor proposed a novel two-step, 
lensless imaging process, originally 
termed as wavefront reconstruction and 
referred to as in-line holography.[1] 
Although holography is ideal for 
recording the three-dimensional 
information about objects, its usefulness 
is limited by a conjugate image and 
zero-order image. As well as, in in-line 
holography, the reconstructed image 
inevitably suffers from dc term and its 
conjugate image, which can overlap with 
the reconstructed image and cause 
blurring. The problem was solved when 
Leith and Upatnieks[2] developed the 
off-axis reference beam technique. Even 
so, this approach prevents the effective 
use of a CCD, such that only a fraction 
of the total hologram information is 
recorded to reconstruct the object. 
Yamaguchi and Zhang[3] proposed the 
solution that multiple recordings with 
phase shifts of 0, λ/4, λ/2, and 3λ/4 can 
be used to eliminate the undesired terms 
from the digital hologram without 
sacrificing any active areas of the CCD. 
However, a phase-shifting digital 
holographic system requires the 
recording of digital holograms on a 
vibration-free optical table. This 
procedure is convenient only in a 
laboratory and cannot be used with 
moving targets during multiple 
hologram recording.[4] In recent 
development, especially Schnars et al,[5] 
presented the singles-exposure in-line 
digital holography. In this approach, the 
so-called dc term, which represents 
mainly the contribution of the reference 
wave to the zero-order, is eliminated by 
subtraction of the average intensity of 
the hologram. But, the simple operation 
maintains the twin image intact and only 
partially suppression of the zero-order 
image if the object wave intensity is not

Fig. 1. Simulation results: (a) input

Fig. 1 plots the results of the 
simulation of off-axis holography, where 
the length of the optical path from object 
to the CCD is 10.80cm, and the ratio of 
the intensity of object wave to that of the 
reference wave is 1:1. The reconstructed 
image shows in Fig. 1(b). Although it 
can be seen from numerical 
reconstruction, that the different terms of 
interference pattern produce 
well-separated contribution. The twin 
images are mostly superposed on the 
zero-order image and cannot be almost 
resolved. Therefore, it is impossible to 
obtain useful information about the 
object if the zero-order image is not 
eliminated. Eq. (5) can be worked out 
through the numerical operation on 
P4-3.0GHz personal computer and 
Matlab 6.0 software.[8,9,10] It can be 
seen from fig. 1(c) that the object wave 
and its conjugate wave can be resolved 
effectively. Fig. 1(d) shows that 
computed two-dimensional Fourier 
spectrum of the reconstructed image 
shown in Fig.1 (c)[11]. In Fig.1 (d), the 
spectrum peak demonstrates that 
zero-order image has been almost 
completely suppressed.

setup. SF: spatial filter, PBS: polarized 
beam splitter, BS: beam splitter. 
The experiment system shown in Fig. 
2 is Mach-Zehnder setup.[12] The 
He-Ne laser with the power of 20 mW, 
wavelength=632.8 nm, is used as the 
light source. Two λ/2 retarded 
wave-plates and a polarized 
beam-splitter are used to adjust the ratio 
of intensity of the object wave to that of 
the reference wave. The two waves are 
collimated by using spatial filters and 
lenses. Transparent characters ‘中正’ of 
size of 1 mm×2 mm, written on a 
photographic slide, are used as the 
object. The hologram is recorded with a 
CCD sensor (Pixera-150SS CCD camera, 
1040×1392 pixels). The length of the 
optical path between the CCD and the 
object is 10.80cm. Fig. 3(a) & (c) show 
that the holograms have been recorded 
by a CCD and the experiment setup is 
presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 3(b) & (d) show 
the reconstructed images obtained by the 
image to that of the object wave. In Fig. 
4(a) and (b), the residual spectrum 
power never exceeds 2.5%. Also, the 
arrows in Fig. 4(a) and (b) demonstrate 
the reconstructed images, that the 
zero-order image has been suppressed 
completely, even in the critical condition. 
Therefore, the reconstructed image can 
be resolved clearly. 
5.Conclusion: 
In conclusion, a simple experimental 
method was presented for eliminating 
the zero-order image from the digital 
holography. The advantage of this 
approach is that the optical setup and the 
experimental procedure are simple and 
the result is satisfactory. As the 
zero-order image is filtered, both the 
contrast of the reconstructed image and 
the image quality are enhanced. The 
approach could be used to reconstruct 
the profile of a phase object.
