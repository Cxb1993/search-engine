中文摘要 
 
感測器的微型化以及將微電子技術應用於不同的感測元件或感測裝置，是一個
明顯的發展趨勢。藉由這些技術，可以解決感測器敏感度不足的問題、提高解析度、
並減低流體量測及時所造成對流動的干擾。不過，在微感測運作時，因空間與時間
尺度的大幅度降低，在薄膜成型過程中因曝露於外部的影響之下所產生的高度內部
應力也會造成一些新的問題。因此在微感測器中，探討內部與外部的各界面層的作
用及運作特性是極為必要的。薄膜感測器具有高的表面/體積比值，且在其界面處共
軛介質的晶格需要有相容性，因此其必須具有能在外部場(熱、機械、電磁、輻射場)
影響下，產生結構-相轉換的叢集結構。若能掌握界面處的應力與應變分佈特性，便
可有效地改變感測器的結構與敏感度特性。

Abstract 
We can observe a tendency to miniaturize the sensors and to employ 
microelectronics technologies in the domain of modern sensing devices and sensitive 
elements of different types of sensors. This allows one to solve the problem of the 
sensitivity and resolution increase from one side, and to reduce the disturbing effect 
introduced to the flow by a probe. However considerable decrease of space and time 
scales in functioning of microsensors is connected with a number of new problems 
caused by high level of internal stress that appears in thin films in a process of their 
formation and exposed to external influence. In such circumstances the consideration of 
the functional role of internal and external interfaces in MEMS-based sensors becomes 
very topical. Because of high surface/volume aspect ratio as well as the necessity of

Figure 1. A concentrated force in bimaterials. 
  
Based upon the Green’s functions shown in eqn. (1), a special boundary element for 
interface problems has been designed by following the standard procedure of boundary 
element formulation. From Figure 2 we see that the stresses above and below the 
interface calculated from the commercial finite element ANSYS are discontinuous, which 
is incorrect and will approach to the same values only when very fine meshes are used 
near the interfaces. On the other hand, the solutions obtained from the special boundary 
element designed in this project will always provide continuous stresses across the 
interface. We believe this improvement will play an important role in our related works of

extra fixed end of the fixed-fixed carbon nanocone, which strengthen the cone structure 
and prevent the carbon atoms from escaping from its cone body. 
Carbon nanocones (CNCs) have their innovative applications in nanotechnology, 
such as scanning probe tips and electron field emitters [1], due to their nanoscale sizes 
and unusual mechanical behaviors. Although many studies have been carried out by 
experimental methods to observe the unusual properties of the carbon nanocones, 
theoretical and/or numerical studies of mechanical behaviors of carbon nanocones are not 
numerous from the available literature. Among the numerical studies, Tasi and Fang [2] 
investigated the nucleation, thermal stability and nanomechanics of single-walled carbon 
nanocones by molecular dynamics simulations. Liew et al. [3] employed molecular 
dynamics simulations to inspect buckling and post-buckling behaviors of single-walled 
open-ended carbon nanocones with apex angles of 19.2°. They also used the molecular 
dynamics simulations to examine tensile mechanical properties, including the 
force-deformation responses and Young’s modulus, of single-walled open-ended carbon 
nanocones [4]. 
Thermal stability of single-walled open-ended carbon nanocones with apex angles of 
19.2° was investigated via molecular dynamics simulations. The carbon nanocones 
analyzed have a top radius of 6.8 Å, a bottom radius of 17.1 Å and a height of 61 Å. 
Thermal stability of the carbon nanocone with a fixed bottom end and a free top end (i.e., 
the fixed-free carbon nanocone) was compared with that of the carbon nanocone with 
both ends fixed (i.e., the fixed-fixed carbon nanocone). One-tenth of the cone height was 
modeled as the fixed end region. The thermal stability was inspected by increasing the 
temperature of the carbon nanocone gradually up to a critical value at which certain 
atoms began to escape from its cone body. An NVT (canonical) ensemble was used in the 
molecular dynamics simulations and the Tersoff bond-order potential [5] was employed 
to model interactions of the carbon atoms of the carbon nanocone, which can be 
expressed as 
)]()()[( ijAijijRijcij rVbrVrfV                     (3) 
where Vij represents the interaction potential energy between atoms i and j, VR a repulsive 
pair potential, VA an attractive pair potential, fc a smooth cutoff function, and bij a 
measure of the bond order [5]. 
In addition, the velocity Verlet’s algorithm [6] for time integration of the system’s 
equations of motion and the velocity rescaling scheme [6] for a thermostat of the system 
were employed in the simulations. During the integration, a time step of 10-15 s (1 fs) was 
chosen. For simulation stability, 100,000 initial iterations at an initial temperature of 300 
K for system relaxation were carried out first and the temperature was then elevated 
gradually from the initial temperature at a rise rate of 5 K per 10,000 time steps until the 
critical temperature reached. The thermal stability was inspected by examining the 
critical temperature of the carbon nanocones. 
Figures 8 and 9 showed atomistic configuration evolutions of the fixed-free and the 
fixed-fixed carbon nanocones, respectively, during the temperature elevation process. For 
the fixed-free carbon nanocone, it was noticed that the atom escape began at a 
temperature of 4235 K, while for the fixed-fixed carbon nanocone it began at a critical 
temperature of 4805 K. The critical temperature of the fixed-fixed carbon nanocone was 
found to be higher than that of the fixed-free carbon nanocone. This may ascribe to the 
constraints from the extra fixed end of the fixed-fixed carbon nanocone, which strengthen

4. Studies of Knudsen compressor by Molecular Dynamic method 
Recent advances in MEMS have made it possible to construct microscale sensors 
such as integrated gas chromatography systems, miniature spectrometers, and mass 
spectrometers.  The miniaturized detection devices will require microscale roughing 
pumps to provide sensors elements with gas samples at necessary environmental 
conditions. 
A pumping mechanism that can be exploited at microscale is thermal transpiration, a 
rarefied gas effect that drives gas flow along temperature gradient in a tube or channel.  
In some literatures this effect is also called Knudsen effect.  This phenomenon of low 
pressure gases (or gases in microscale systems) suggests that, by connecting two tanks 
with a very fine tube, one can transport a certain amount of gas from one to the other if a 
gradient of temperature is set up between two tanks. That is, the fine tube with a 
temperature gradient has a pumping effect.  Model discussed in present work has been 
created based on previous studying of Muntz[7] and Alexeenko[8, 9].

Abstract 
The consideration of the functional role of internal and external interfaces in 
MEMS-based sensors is very topical. Governing the stress-strain distribution at the 
interface one can effectively influence sensor structure and, therefore, their sensitivity 
characteristics. The investigation was performed both in Russia (ITAM SB RAS, ISPMS 
SB RAS) and Taiwan (Department of Aeronautic and Astronautic of NCKU) using 
MEMS-based sensors manufactured in Taiwan. Followings are the works done in Taiwan 
sides during this year (the second year of this project): 
- Using the continuum mechanics approach to analyze strained state at the interfaces 
between different media. The results of the first year for anisotropic bi-materials 
has been extended successfully to piezoelectric bi-materials this year. 
- Using the molecular dynamic simulation and finite element simulation to perform 
the fracture and interface analysis of thin film structures. 
- Molecular dynamic simulation of thermal effects on tensile and compressive 
behavior of the open-ended single-wall carbon nanocones. 
- Molecular Dynamics studying of Argon atoms scattering on a copper surface

where α and D are constants with dimensions of reciprocal distance and energy, and 0r  
is the equilibrium distance of the two atoms. The simulation environments are constant 
temperature conditions. The temperature is controlled by velocity rescaling method. The 
model is composed of 216 lattice units, with six units aligned along each x, y and z axes, 
and totally 864 particles in this model. Setting periodic boundary condition in x direction, 
the boundary length is 21.8827Ǻ and the temperature is 298K. The time step is 1.0fs and 
the dynamic time is 1000.0ps. The strain increases 0.01 for each 100.0ps until the strain 
reaches 0.1. Figure 3 shows the stress distribution of this model with the unit Pa (N/m2). 
The red points stand for higher stress while the blue points stand for the lower stress. 
Through this figure we see that the stresses at outer portion are less than those in the 
central portion even they are under pure tension condition. Since this result is different 
from the conventional thinking of continuum mechanics, further verification is needed in 
our future study.

3. Molecular dynamic simulation of thermal effects on tensile and compressive 
behavior of the open-ended single-wall carbon nanocones 
Owing to the novel properties of the carbon nanocones (CNCs), researchers have 
paid greater attention toward their mechanical properties, fabrication, and applications[5]. 
One recent novel application of the CNCs is that by taking advantages of their nanoscale 
size and high stiffness, CNCs have been used as scanning probe tips and electron field 
emitters [6, 7]. 
The study of CNCs was initiated by Ge and Sattler [8]. They predicted that CNCs 
could be classified into five types according to their conical angles, namely, 19.2°、
38.9°、60°、86.6°, and 123.6°. The five conical angles were also verified by Krishnan et al. 
[7] via experimental method. In addition, apex-truncated open-ended CNCs could be 
generated by precise control of the synthetic conditions [9,10]. Eksioglu and Nadarajah 
[11] demostrated that the open CNCs have the same five conical angles as the closed 
CNCs. Similar to CNTs, CNCs were shown to have single-walled and multi-walled 
structural types [9-13]. Although experimental studies on CNCs have got great 
achievements in recent years, theoretical researches on mechanical properties of CNCs 
are limitted. Tsai and Fang [14] used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the 
nucleation, thermal stability and nanomechanics of CNCs. Liew et al. [15] also utilized 
molecular dynamics simulations to study buckling and post-bulking behaviors of CNCs. 
Later, they applied the same method to investigations of mechanical properties of CNCs 
[16].

On the other hand, Figure 9 conveys the thermal effects on the compressive stain 
energy-strain relation and the atomic configurations of the compression states. In this 
figure, the geometrical conditions are the same as those considered in Figure 8 and the 
numerical simulations are performed at T = 300, 400, and 500 K. It is found that in 
general the strain energy increases with the compressive strain. When the temperature is 
increased, the strain energy is also elevated. Meanwhile, one observes a fluctuation 
associated with each of the curves in this figure. The fluctuation of the curves is 
attributed to the larger kinetic and potential energy changes caused by an increase in 
temperature as well as the compression.

Bessel function of order 0. 
This model includes two parameters: the accommodation coefficients for normal 
energy and tangential momentum. Therefore, the CLL model is more flexible in 
representing the distribution of the re-emitted molecules than the Maxwell model. 
The models mentioned above have some intrinsic limits: 
 The use of constant accommodation coefficients in the formulation does not 
seem appropriate to cover a wide range of impinging energies. It seems necessary to 
consider a dependence of the accommodation coefficients on the impinging particles 
conditions (i.e. energy, incidence angle). 
 For all described models the energy and momentum accommodation 
coefficients are connected by a functional relationship, which reduces the flexibility of 
the model. 
 Discrete accommodation coefficient models do not seem able to reproduce the 
real behaviors. 
Current studies were focused on both checking validity of existed models for case of 
Ar-Cu interactions and proposing new model for Ar scattering by Cu substrate 
description. Present studies were performed by using Molecular Dynamics (MD) 
simulation method, which is based on fundamental principles of classical mechanics. 
Such approach allows to describe processes on gas-surface boundary precisely. 
 
Model Description 
Studied physical system is consisted of a copper substrate having temperature 
300sT K  and argon atoms which “bombarded” substrate with initial velocity vector 
magnitude iV  and incident angles of i , i , as shown in Figure 10. Simulation 
procedure can be described as argon atoms collisions with Cu substrate and following 
determination of scattered particle’s parameters sV , s  and s  (Figure 10).

Interactions between copper atoms in substrate were described by Morse potential

energy. Another important statements which can be made from Figure 11(a) is that 
particles with low incident velocity ( 1iV  ) were scattered with a nearly constant 
average velocity V  =1 independently on incident angle i , but if value of iV  exceed 
1  ( 1iV  ) then average velocity of scattered particles becomes lower than its incident 
velocity. This behavior can be explained in terms of heat transfer from surface to gas and 
backward, thus the first region ( 1iV  ) is gas heating by surface region and the second 
one ( 1iV  ) is gas cooling by surface region.

Figure 11(b). Average velocity V  of scattered sV  particles versus incident angle i  for different 
incident particle’s velocity iV  when 0i  . 
 
From Figure 11(b), one can see that in case of small incident velocity ( 1iV  ) 
scattered particles have almost the same scattered average velocities ( V  =1) 
independently from i  angle, but nonlinearity of the dependence changes with incident 
velocity magnitude. 
Figures 12(a) and 12(b) show average value   of scattered angle s  versus 
incident velocity magnitude and incident angle i , respectively. One can see that both 
dependences are nonlinear, but it should be noted that angles s  are almost the same for 
all i  in case of small incident velocity magnitude iV . It means that for small iV  
particle scattering tends to be more diffusive than specular. 
It can be seen that relations discussed above look complicated and a simple 
approximation functions can not be concluded easily. This issue means that Ar-Cu 
interactions should be described by using numerical approach instead of analytical 
functions.

Figures 16(a) and 16(b) represent distributions of   angle having 103.5   and 
48.49   respectively. One can see that for 103.5   distribution of probability 
density has uniform shape, but in case of 48.49   distribution of probability density 
can be fitted by normal distribution function. 
It has been found that for 94   probability density function has uniform shape, 
meanwhile for 94   probability density function (PDF) can be fitted by normal 
distribution function. Such behavior means that for combination of iV , i  satisfied by 
smaller value of   particles have more probability to keep their lateral velocity than 
for another combination of iV , i  which corresponds for grater value of  . 
Figure 17 and Figure 18 represent probability density function of s  and sV  
respectively. It can be seen that PDF of particle’s scattered velocity as well as PDF of 
angle s  are well fitted by normal distribution function based on calculated mean 
values and RMSD for angle and velocity. 
Results discussed above contradict with CLL and Maxwell models of boundary 
conditions. First of all parameters of scattered particles strongly depend on incident 
particle’s parameters and these dependences are totally nonlinear. Distributions of 
scattered particle’s can be described by normal distribution function. It is in contrast to 
Maxwell model in which velocities satisfy Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 
Summarizing above results discussed above the following algorithm for

1. Continuum mechanics approach for interface problems - viscoelastic bi-materials 
In the first two years of this project, a special boundary element for interface 
problems has been designed for anisotropic bi-materials and piezoelectric bi-materials. 
By continuing this continuum mechanics (CM) approach, in the third year the special 
boundary element is further extended to the interface problems of viscoelastic 
bi-materials. If the interfaces between two dissimilar viscoelastic materials are perfect 
bonded, it is found that the mathematical expressions for the continuity of displacement 
and traction in Laplace domain are exactly the same as those of anisotropic materials if 
the Stroh formalism is employed for the analysis. This finding tells us the boundary 
elements designed in our previous study for anisotropic bi-materials can easily be 
extended to the cases of viscoelastic bi-materials in Laplace domain. After getting the 
solutions in Laplace domain, simply using the numerical inversion of Laplace transform 
we can get the solution in time domain. Following is an example showing the stress 
distribution for the interface between two dissimilar viscoelastic materials. 
Consider a bimaterial made by two dissimilar isotropic viscoelastic materials 
subjected to uniform tension 0  at two ends (Figure 11). Both of the materials can be 
characterized by the shear relaxation function /0( ) ( )

Figure 2 shows the variation of the stresses y  at point (0.14,0)m for the time period

calculated by ANSYS (PLANE183) are discontinuous, which is incorrect and will 
approach to the values calculated by the present BEM when fine meshes are used near the 
interfaces. On the other hand, the solutions obtained from the present BEM will always 
provide continuous stresses across the interface. Figure 3 shows the variation of the

calculation of potential energy in molecular mechanics can be obtained. By treating this 
potential energy as the strain energy of deformed solids, the mechanical properties can 
then be determined through the differentiation of strain energy with respect to strains. 
Verification of the concept and derivation procedure proposed in this study is then made 
by an example whose analytical solution has been provided in the literature such as the 
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for a single-walled carbon nanotube. Furthermore, 
experimental results measured by atomic force microscopy and numerical results 
simulated by molecular dynamics or finite element modeling will all be compared to see 
the appropriateness of the present analytical model. The cases of general elastic solids 
will then be done in our future work. Followings are some results for copper (Cu), 
graphite, and carbon nanotube (CNT) obtained in this study.

of CNTs [4]. As the apex angle expands, geometry of the CNC becomes much far from 
that of the CNT. The buckling mode therefore transfers from like that of the CNT (an 
axisymmetric pattern) to far from that of the CNT (an unsymmetrical and more warped 
pattern). 
In summary, a simulation model together with MD simulations has been applied to 
the investigation of compressive behaviors of open-tip CNCs under axial strains. 
Influences of the cone height and apex angle on the compressive behaviors were 
examined in the study. From results of this study, it was noticed that the critical strain and 
critical load of the CNC reduce apparently with the increase in the apex angle. As the 
cone height of the CNC grows, the critical strain drops evidently owing to the rise in the 
slenderness ratio. However, the cone height also has no obvious influences on the critical 
load because of the non-uniform radius along the cone axis of the CNC. As the cone 
height enlarges, the buckling mode displays a more distorted buckling pattern due to the 
increase in the slenderness. With the expansion of the apex angle, the buckling mode 
transfers from an axisymmetric pattern for the CNC with the smallest apex angle (19.2°) 
to an unsymmetrical and more warped pattern because of the reduction in rigidity of the 
CNC.

powerful tools for scientific computing. However, until recently GPUs have been limited 
to operations specific to graphics processing, restricting their usefulness for 
computational purposes. Fortunately, recent efforts have led to the development of 
general purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) and programming environments such like GL Shader 
Language (GLSL) [5], C for Graphics [6], the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device 
Architecture (CUDA) [7] and so on. Until recently, almost all programming languages 
providing possibility of effective computations using GPU are C-like languages, 
meanwhile the most popular programming language in scientific society is Fortran. The 
Portland Group and NVIDIA have worked in cooperation to develop CUDA Fortran, the 
last version of CUDA Fortran provides full access to the GPU [8]. 
Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a form of computer simulation in which atoms are 
allowed to interact for a period of time by approximations of known physics, giving a 
view of the motion of the atoms. This method is commonly used for simulations gas, 
liquid and solid substances on molecular level. However, MD simulations are limited to 
two constraints: an enormous number of atoms and time steps. Fortunately MD 
algorithms are well-parallelizable what follows from their nature, therefore usage of 
GPUs for MD simulations is very attractive due to the relatively low price, compact size 
and low power consumption of GPUs compare to PC clusters. High-bandwidth memory 
and hardware implementation of multithreading enable GPUs to outperform traditional 
CPU cores on data parallel workloads by factors ranging from ten to thirty times faster in 
the most cases [9], up to as much as one hundred times faster in a few ideal cases [10,11]. 
The purpose of this work was to create program for MD simulations of copper 
crystal using CUDA technique and to compare performance of different GPUs in order to 
find the most appropriate one. 
Obtained results allowed us to conclude that gaming GPUs give better performance 
than professional one and usage of the CUDA technique reduces simulation time more 
than 30 time compare to the program executed on a single core. 
 
Physical model 
Current theoretical research was performed numerically by using Molecular 
Dynamics simulation method. Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a form of computer 
simulation in which atoms are allowed to interact for a period of time by approximations 
of known physics, giving a view of the motion of the atoms. 
All test and simulations were performed by considering simple model of cubic unit of 
copper substrate (Figure 11). Interactions between copper atoms were described by 
Morse potential function [12]:

link atoms to cells with following data transfer to the GPU, next the device performs 
other operations (Verlet lists construction, calculation of acting forces and integration of 
equations of motion). 
The simple one dimensional threads structure (grid) is used in current work, also the 
third Newton’s law is not implemented because it requires usage of atomic instructions 
preventing data race. The main advantage of such simple algorithm is scalability and 
compatibility with almost all CUDA capable GPUs, nevertheless this parallel 
implementation provides significant speed up of program execution compare to the series 
algorithm. 
 
Equipment description 
Several different desktop computer’s configurations having different GPUs were 
used in current studies. Table 3 represents properties of graphics processing units used in 
the work. 
The first three devices listed in Table 3 are gaming GPUs, meanwhile the last device 
is the professional GPU, designed for computations and video streaming. The other 
parameters of the computer are: CPU i7-950; Mother Board – P6X58D by ASUS with

Results and discussion 
Table 4 represents simulation of two-dimensional system of atoms having mass and 
potential parameters corresponding to copper atoms. One can see that the all both GTX 
and Tesla C1060 graphic card support double precision floating point operations, 
meanwhile single precision operations consume almost twice less time than single 
  49
better on the gaming GPU (GTX460), meanwhile “hybrid” algorithm (CLL+Verlet, 
which scales almost with N) shows better performance on Tesla C1060. This results can 
be explained taking in account that memory interface width of Tesla C1060 GPU in two 
times larger than GTX 460, so C1060 caches data faster than GTX 460. When number of 
operations to be done increases the number of CUDA cores starts to play more important 
role and GTX 460 outperforms the C1060. 
Another important issue is that Verlet sorting method requires block size as big as 
possible, while “hybrid” algorithm has the best performance when the block size is equal 
to 64, but in the same time Verlet sorting method works faster on C1060 when the block 
size become small.

Table 6 shows the speed up of program can be reached implementing it on CUDA GPU 
compare to the similar program, but executed on the CPU. The speed up shown in the 
table is quite normal for the MD simulations on GPU, which means that even simple 
program implemented on GPU gives significant benefits compare to its series edition. It 
is clear that more atoms we have more acceleration GPU provides.  
 
Conclusion 
Results discussed above allow us to conclude that gaming graphic processing units 
have good potential to become base for “home” or desktop supercomputer, such GPUs 
has lower price than professional ones, but the main disadvantage of gaming devices is 
relatively low amount of installed RAM. Another important conclusion is that optimal 
choice of a GPU for computations depends on algorithms which supposed to be 
implemented on a GPU, this results is very important because the choice of a CPU is 
usually independent on the algorithms which supposed to be executed in it.

訪問及參加會議經過： 
參訪 Moscow State University (2009.9.14) 
 在原本的行程安排中我們到訪莫斯科的第一天主要是參與國科會駐莫斯科代表
處所安排之歡迎晚宴，該晚宴邀集此次參與「西伯利亞-台灣論壇」之台俄學界代表
及官方人事，以促進雙方交流為目的。 也因如此在白天的空檔中，我方學界代表一
行十餘人便抽空參訪莫斯科大學，由於並未事先安排，大體僅在校園體驗俄國頂尖
大學之氣氛。 即便如此，也讓我們感受到身為世界一流大學，不僅內在之師資設備
很重要，就連外在之建築風格也很重要，如果整體校園建築讓人感受到學術氣息，
在內工作及學習之師生們無形中更能激起其創新發展之潛能。 
 
 
參訪 Tomsk State University (2009.9.16) 
 這次「西伯利亞-台灣論壇」的主要場地就是 Tomsk State University 的科學圖書
館(Scientific Library)。此次論壇有 3 個主題: Innovation, Science and Business，因此
參與論壇之人員基本上被分為 3 組: Technology Scientist’s Group, Bio-medical 
Scientist’s Group and TRA Business Group。 我個人屬於 Technology Scientist’s 
Group，為讓本組成員瞭解俄羅斯 Tomsk 地區之相關研究進展，大會特地於會議的
第一天(9/16)下午安排我們參訪 Tomsk State University 的相關實驗室，參訪過程中亦
有攝影工作同仁隨行。 經由對方的介紹，我們知道 Tomsk 基本上是一大學城，全
州有 1/4 之人口(總人口約 200 萬人)為學生、教授及研究員，每年約有 300 博士候選
人在 Tomsk 產生，而 Tomsk State University 亦為俄國之頂尖一流大學(within Top 5)。  
  55
Cooperation」，很清楚地點出本會的目的在於科技創新之合作，而我個人之所以會參
與此一會議是源自於我們正在執行一台俄合作計劃，俄方主持人在今年初即來函詢
問我們是否願意參與此一盛會，同時可藉此一機會與俄方主持人討論我們的研究進
度。因為我們正在進行之台俄國合計畫: 「新世代奈米結構材料感測器研發」，與界
面問題息息相關，所以我在此一會議中報告的題目為: 「Fracture Analyses for 
Interface Problems」，我個人所發表之論文被大會安排於 Technology Scientist’s 
Group，時間為 10:00-10:30, September 16, 2009,與一般論文發表時間不同的是我的文
章被安排講 30 分鐘，而其餘的文章都是 15min 或 10min 或 Poster，我不清楚此一時
間長短的差異有何特殊含意，但在主持人介紹我發表時，確實已感受到對方對我所
談問題之興趣，讓我頗有受到重視的感覺。 
此會議有一非常特別的地方是，大會從頭到尾都有安排即時翻譯人員，以方便
會議之進行。因此如果俄方人員以俄文發表論文時，我們只需將耳機之 Channel 轉
至英文 Channel 即可瞭解對方以俄文報告之論文內容，而在開幕典禮的官方致詞上
(約 2 小時)，更有中文翻譯之安排。這些安排都充分表現出俄羅斯承辦單位對此一
會議重視的程度。 
 
 
討論「台俄國合計畫-新世代奈米結構材料感測器研發」(2009.9.17) 
 由於這次行程安排頗為緊湊，幾乎沒有空檔，使得我們與俄方計畫主持人(Prof. 
Victor E. Panin and Dr. Alexey V. Panin)很難找出討論問題的時間，利用幾次 Coffee 
Break 的短暫討論後，我們選定了 9/17 下午 4:00-5:00，幾個主要的教授(我方除了我
之外還有鄭金祥教授及呂宗行教授)聚在會場旁討論我們的計畫進度及未來可能繼
續合作的方向。由於 4:00 以前我們彼此都聽過對方發表之論文，對大家的專長及興
趣有了更進一步的認識後，俄方主持人 Prof. Victor E. Panin(俄國科學院院士)準備了
許多他近期內的作品與我們討論，在他講解之下，我深深覺得我的報告內容(Interface 
Problems)確實與他的研究息息相關，而且對方真不愧為國家院士，所談之問題確實
點中我的問題核心，他也將他所帶來的文章全部交給我，以方便我閱讀。我相信這
不算長的合作計畫討論，對我未來的研究幫助很大。 雖然我們此一計劃已合作一年
多，但以往大多與 Prof. Victor E. Panin 的兒子(Dr. Alexey V. Panin)接觸與討論，一直
沒有機會親自與他討論問題，這次藉由參與台俄論壇的機會與 Panin 院士深入討論
Interface Problem，確實獲益良多，也讓我覺得未來的合作計畫一定會有更好的發展。  
 
  57
 這次會議不論以我個人執行台俄國合計畫的角度來看，亦或以整體台俄合作的
角度來看，都是一個相當成功的會議。究其原因，應在於雙方政府之重視。 我個人
認為稍有美中不足之處在於時間之安排過於緊迫，使得許多問題之討論(如 Round 
Table)無法得到具體結論，同時學界之論文發表也因時間限制的關係，並未安排討
論時間。為使未來雙邊會議能更有實質成效，建議未來考慮增加討論時間，並在雙
方協議內容中訂定執行時限，以追蹤會議決議之成效。

會議之研討情形可發現，俄羅斯在工程領域方面的研究相當先進，且多項技術具世
界水準與商業化價值。我國與會者皆有一個共識，即未來應投入更多人力及物力以
發展台俄雙邊關係，以加強雙邊關係並提升我國科技水準。成功大學亦應把握這一
波與俄國各大學交流的機會，以提升學校的國際能見度與學術地位。圖六為參與本

2011. 6. 18 
參加會議經過： 
模擬技術國際會議(International Conference on Simulation Technology)並非一般
之國際會議，知道此一會議訊息的學者並不多，我個人是由一美國教授傳遞的電子
郵件中得知此一會議消息。 當我看到此一會議預計討論的議題及邀請的講者時，我
就覺得這是一值得參加的會議，然而當我再繼續詳讀其相關資料時才知道此一會議
並不接受一般參與者之論文發表，僅只接受一般參與者之張貼論文，同時也將有張
貼論文之競賽。 如此一來卻有點耽心經費補助的問題，幸好經詢問過後確定我個人
之台俄計畫的出國費用應可補助出席國際會議張貼論文，才稍微放心投稿，並決定
讓我個人的博士生也一起參與聽取與模擬技術相關之新知。 
會前曾耽心此一會議僅接受張貼論文是否會影響參與之人數，然至報到現場得
知整體參與人數約 200 餘人，人數相當於一般之中小型國際會議。細看會議張貼論
文摘要(Book of Poster Abstracts)得知約 8 成以上學者來自德國本土，其餘學者零零
星星約來自十餘個不同的國家，其中中國大陸 4 位，台灣除我及我的學生外另有成
大機械系之張怡玲教授及其學生，除自己投稿張貼論文的參與學者外，大會主動邀
請口頭報告的學者共計 34 人，其中 13 人為Keynote Speakers，21人為minisymposium
的 Oral Presenters，這些學者大多為 University of Stuttgart 自己的教授亦或與該校有
關的教授，大多來自德國其他學校或美國知名學府，沒有任何口頭報告之學者來自
亞洲國家。 原感覺這樣之會議一點也不像國際會議，有點失望，然連續幾天持續地
逐場聽下來，覺得這是一個相當難得的國際會議，是德國政府大力贊助之會議，主
要在驗收及檢驗德國計算模擬技術的主要研究中心 (Cluster of Excellence): 
University of Stuttgart 的研究成果，這也說明了為什麼此一會議與一般之國際會議的
差異，也讓我們感受到此一會議的註冊費雖然不高(250Euro)，但所有 Social Events
都準備非常周到。 藉由大會演講及社交活動亦認識了許多新朋友如 Martin Falk, Dr. 
Mathias J. Krause，及會議主席 Prof. W. Ehlers，…等等。 
 
 
與會心得： 
本次會議除一般之張貼論文(約 170 份)及 mini-symposium 外，所有會議集中在
一大型場地，所有報告者都是 Keynote Speaker。 Keynote Lecture 的講者及講題分
別為: (6/15) Prof. K. Schulten (U. of Illinois, USA): The computational Microscope 
Images Biomolecular Machines and Nanodevices; Prof. P. Gumbsch (Germany): 
Simulation of Tribological Contacts at Atomic Resolution; Prof. M. Ortiz (California 
Institute of Technology, USA): Multiscale Analysis as an Approximation Scheme),…等
等 ( 詳 如 附 件 ) 。 Mini-symopsium 有 :Bridging scales in particle simulations,

學校之知名度、會議主題及講者名單有關。) 
3. 會議之安排必須非常細心，例如：論文集應找國際知名書商承印以廣開銷售
管道並打開國內相關研究之國際知名度，同時亦可將論文集錄製成光碟片以方便攜
帶；論文集附錄必須有 Author Index，Subject Index 等以方便聆聽場次之選擇及論文
之查閱；與會交通之安排；會前會後旅遊活動之安排；眷屬活動之安排等等，皆需
細心之規劃。(本次會議承辦單位相當認真，相關安排頗為細心，然因會議並不接受
論文全文，會中僅提供紙本之會議議程及摘要論文集，對會議期間之參閱頗為方便。 
同時此次會議所收取之註冊費雖較一般國際會議低廉許多，但所提供之服務及餐點
卻不輸其他大規模之國際會議，尤其是會中安排在賓士博物館之晚宴，是包下整個
場地給與會者參觀並討論交流，相當難得，可算是一盡心盡力之承辦單位。) 
4.會議地點應可考慮觀光地點之大飯店，同時事前設法議取誘人之價格，以方
便國外學者攜眷前來。 同時會議住宿之安排必須非常細心，例如：住宿地點與會議
場地間之交通，住宿地之餐飲問題等等。若可能，住宿地點與會議場地同一且屬五
星級飯店價格低廉，即是一優質組合。(本次會議所在地點為學校，並非飯店或其他
特殊地點，然該校為知名學校，其本身即是一吸引人之地點，加上德國全國公共交
通系統非常健全，與會者並無交通上之困擾。 即使公共交通很方便，在晚宴前後大
會仍安排 Bus 接送參與者，確實安排周到。) 
5. 會議論文之篩選非常重要，否則夾雜部份不理想之作品及發表者，徒然浪費
大部份參與人員之寶貴時間，從而影響會議之品質。(本次會議僅只大會主動邀請的
34 位學者得以口頭報告，且全部 13 位 keynote speakers 皆在單一場次報告，報告
者皆為國際一流學者，因此並無報告品質不良之顧慮，更無因故未能參與造成報告
中斷之情形發生。)

ABSTRACT 
Usually the mechanical properties of general elastic solids are determined by 
performing standard tests in the laboratory. When the solids are designable or are made 
of constituent materials in micro or nano scale that are not easy to test, a suitable model 
for the estimation of mechanical properties becomes important. To achieve this goal, 
several different approaches have been proposed in the literature such as the 
micromechanics approach for heterogeneous composite materials, the molecular 
dynamics approach for nanomaterials, and the approaches combining the concepts of 
continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics. If the nanomaterials are considered, most 
of the proposed approaches reply on the numerical simulation of molecular dynamics or 
finite element modeling. Very few of them consider the analytical modeling. In this paper, 
an analytical model based on continuum mechanics as well as molecular mechanics is 
proposed to estimate the mechanical properties of general elastic solids which may be in 
macro or micro or nano scale.  
Through the as made experimental state such as the assumed tensile or pure shear 
state, the deformed position of each atom of the test specimen can be determined by the 
theory of elasticity. With the knowledge of the undeformed and deformed positions of 
each atom, the bond distance and bond angles between atoms which are essential for the 
calculation of potential energy in molecular mechanics can be obtained. By treating this 
potential energy as the strain energy of deformed solids, the mechanical properties can 
then be determined through the differentiation of strain energy with respect to strains. 
Verification of the concept and derivation procedure proposed in this paper is then made 
by an example whose analytical solution has been provided in the literature such as the 
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for a single-walled carbon nanotube. Furthermore, 
experimental results measured by atomic force microscopy and numerical results 
simulated by molecular dynamics or finite element modeling will all be compared to see 
the appropriateness of the present analytical model. The cases of general elastic solids 
will then be done in our future work.

lems it is important to know the singular orders as well as their associated stress
intensity factors. However, due to the complexity of stresses near the tip of interface
corners/cracks, most of the existing calculation methods will encounter the problem
of accuracy and convergency. To solve this problem, several different approaches
have been proposed in the literature, such as (Raju and Newmann, 1977; Li, et al.,
1998; Labossiere and Dunn, 1999; Sukumar, et al., 2000; Ou et al., 2003; Shah, et
al., 2006; Sanz et al., 2007; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008; Attaporn and Koguchi, 2009).
In this paper, two approaches introduced recently will be discussed. One is the
improvement of the computational method for stress intensity factors by establish-
ing a path independent H-integral for general interface problems (Hwu and Kuo,
2007), and the other is the improvement of boundary element method by including
the fundamental solution of bimaterials.
In addition to the improvement of computational method for interface problems, in
this paper we like to emphasize the unified characteristics of the method introduced
here for the interface corners/cracks. In other words, the formulae and solution
techniques introduced in this paper are applicable for any kinds of anisotropic ma-
terials and piezoelectric materials, as well as any kinds of corners including cracks,
interface cracks, corners and interface corners. Moreover, through the modification
of H-integral, they are valid not only for two dimensional problems but also for
three dimensional problems (Kuo and Hwu, 2009).
2 Near tip solutions for interface cracks and corners
By employing Stroh formalism for anisotropic elasticity, the near tip solution for
interface cracks and corners can be written in terms of the stress intensity factors
as (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu and Kuo, 2007; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008)
u(r,θ) =
1√
2pi
r1−δRV(θ)< (1−δR+ iεα)−1(r/`)iεα >Λ−1k,
φ (r,θ) =
1√
2pi
r1−δRΛ(θ)< (1−δR+ iεα)−1(r/`)iεα >Λ−1k,
(1)
in which u and φ are, respectively, the displacement vector and stress function
vector; k is a vector containing different modes of stress intensity factors; (r,θ)
is the polar coordinate with origin located on the tip of cracks/corners (Figure 1);
the angular bracket <> stands for a diagonal matrix in which each component is
varied according to the subscript α , and the range of the subscript is 1 to 3 for
general anisotropic materials and is 1 to 4 for piezoelectric materials; δR and εα
are, respectively, the real and imaginary part of the most critical singular order
δc which is located in the range of 0 < δR < 1, and sometimes εα is also called
oscillatory index; ` is a length parameter which may be chosen arbitrarily as long

In the above, (σrθ ,σθθ ,σθ3) and Dθ are the components of stresses and electric
displacements in polar coordinate, and KI,KII,KIII and KIV are the stress intensity
factors of opening mode, shearing mode, tearing mode and electric mode.
3 Singular orders of stresses
The near tip solutions shown in eqn.(1) are the solutions associated with the singu-
lar order δ = δR + iεα , in which the singular order should be determined through
the satisfaction of boundary conditions for interface corners/cracks. By employing
Stroh formalism for the general multi-bonded wedges, the orders of stress singu-
larity can be determined by the following eigen-relation (Hwu, et al., 2003; Hwu
and Lee, 2004; Hwu and Ikeda, 2008), which is valid for cracks, interface cracks,
corners and interface corners, and the materials can be any kinds of linear elastic
anisotropic materials or piezoelectric materials.

in counterclockwise direction. For piezoelectric materials, the fourth component
of traction vector t is surface electric displacement and the fourth component of
displacement vector u is the electric potential.
By using the near tip solutions obtained in the literature (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), it
has been proved that the stress intensity factor k is related to the path-independent
H-integral by
k=
√
2piΛ < (1−δR+ iεα)`iεα >H∗−1h, (9)

and h is a vector consisting the value of H-integral calculated with certain specified
complementary solutions.
5 Corner types – cracks, corners, interface cracks or interface corners
To show that the above formulae are valid for several different kinds of cracks and
corners, four examples are illustrated in this section. They are: a center crack in a
homogeneous anisotropic material, a center corner in a homogeneous anisotropic
material, an interface crack between two dissimilar anisotropic materials, an inter-
face corner between two dissimilar anisotropic materials. Although some typical
problems of interface cracks/corners have been presented in our previous paper
(Hwu and Kuo, 2007), for the purpose of comparison most of the examples illus-
trated in that paper are calculated for isotropic materials. To show that the formulae
and their associated solution techniques are valid for any kinds of anisotropic ma-
terials, here we like to extend the examples to the general anisotropic materials.
Moreover, to study the connection between cracks, corners, interface cracks and
interface corners, a particular problem is designed in Figure 1. From this Figure,
we see that when β = 0 the corner problems will be reduced to crack problems,
and when material 1 and material 2 are chosen to be the same material the interface
corners/cracks will be reduced to the corners/cracks in homogeneous materials.
Without loss of generality, in all examples the calculation of singular orders and
stress intensity factors is focused on the right tip of crack/corner.
Example 1: a center crack in a homogeneous anisotropic material
A center crack with size 2a in an infinite anisotropic plate subjected to remote
tension σ is a classical problem in fracture mechanics, which is usually used as
the first check for the advanced studies. It is well known that both of the singular
order and stress intensity factor of this problem are independent of the material
172 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
Again through the same solution techniques, the singular orders and stress intensity
factors of this problem are calculated as
δ = 0.5±0.063i,
KI = 0.180MPa
√
m, KII = 0.024MPa
√
m, KIII = 0.
which agree with the analytical solutions provided in (Hwu, 1993). Through the
comparison with example 1, we see that both KI and KII increase due to the differ-
ence of mechanical properties between material 1 and material 2.
Example 4: an interface corner between two dissimilar materials
Same as example 3 except that β = 30◦ for interface corner. The singular orders
and stress intensity factors of this problem are calculated as
δ = 0.473,
KI = 0.227MPa×m0.473, KII =−0.048MPa×m0.473, KIII = 0.
Again, like the crack/corner in homogeneous materials, by comparison with exam-
ple 3, we see that both of KI and KII increase due to the change from crack to corner
when they are compared under different units. However, unlike cracks in homoge-
neous materials or on the interface of bimaterials compared in examples 1 and 3,
through the comparison with example 2, we see that both the magnitudes of KI
and KII decrease instead of increase due to the difference of mechanical properties
between material 1 and material 2.
6 Material types – anisotropic or piezoelectric
To show that the formulae and solution techniques presented in this paper can also
be extended to the piezoelectric materials, the interface crack/corner between two
dissimilar piezoelectric materials will be discussed in this section through example
5. To see the piezo effects, examples 3 and 4 will be reconsidered by letting the
anisotropic material be the one of piezoelectric materials excluding the piezoelec-
tric constants.
Example 5: an interface crack/corner between two dissimilar piezoelectric materi-
als
Examples 3 and 4 are reconsidered here by replacing the anisotropic materials
with the piezoelectric materials PZT-7A and PZT-5H whose material properties
are listed in Table 1. For both cases, PZT-7A and PZT-5H with γ = 0◦ are em-
ployed to constitute material 1 and material 2 (see Figure 1), respectively. All the
other geometrical dimensions are the same as examples 3 and 4. A uniform remote
174 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
piezoelectric constants. By using the same formulae and solution techniques as
example 1, the singular orders and stress intensity factors of this problem are cal-
culated as follows.
Interface crack:
δ = 0.5±0.008i, 0.5,
KI = 0.177MPa
√
m, KII =−0.003MPa
√
m, KIII = 0,
which agree very well with the analytical solutions provided in the literature (Hwu,
1993).
Interface corner:
δ = 0.487,
KI = 0.210MPa×m0.487, KII = 0.012MPa×m0.487, KIII = 0.
Once again, like the crack/corner in homogeneous materials or lying between two
dissimilar anisotropic materials, the results of examples 5 and 6 show that both of
KI and KII will also increase due to the change from crack to corner when the plates
are made by the piezoelectric materials. Whereas the piezoelectric constants influ-
ence mostly on the appearance of the electric intensity factor, and have insignificant
effect on the magnitude of singular orders and intensity factors of stresses.
7 Problem types – 2D or 3D
Although the near tip solutions and the complementary solutions needed for the
H-integral (8) are derived based upon the assumptions of two-dimensional defor-
mation, it has been proved (Kuo and Hwu, 2009) that through the modification of
H-integral all the solution techniques can be further applied to the associated three-
dimensional problems. The reasons for this successful application are: (1) along the
3D crack/corner front each point can be treated as a tip of 2D crack/corner which
can be considered to be in generalized plane stress condition for crack/corner in the
outer portion and in generalized plane strain condition for crack/corner in the inner
portion; (2) besides the typical 2D stress/strain components, the additional third
directional stress/strain components such as σ13,σ23 and ε13,ε23 are all available in
the near tip solutions obtained by employing Stroh formalism for two-dimensional
anisotropic elasticity (Hwu, et al, 2003; Hwu and Lee, 2004).
Followings are two examples about the edge cracks in isotropic materials. One is
under plane strain condition, and the other is under three-dimensional condition.
To know the difference induced by the consideration of three-dimensional defor-
mation, same geometry and material properties are used in these two examples.
176 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
Consider a rectangular parallelepiped with a through thickness edge crack under
remote tension as shown in Figure 2(b) where the parameters a, t, h, and w are the
crack length, thickness, half height, and half width of this rectangular solid. The
remote tension σo is specified as 1MPa, while a is equal to 1mm. The other dimen-
sions of the specimen are a/w = 1, h/w = 1.75, and t/w = 3, where x3 =±t/2 are the
free surfaces. This rectangular specimen is composed of an isotropic material with
Young’s modulus E = 210GPa and Poisson’s ratio ν = 1/3. To have the same situ-
ation as the comparing published results presented by (Raju and Newmann, 1977;
Li, et al., 1998; Sukumar, et al., 2000), when performing the finite element analysis,
the boundary conditions are set to be u3 = 0 on the surface x3 = 0 due to symmetry,
while u1 = u2 = 0 on the line x1 = w & x2 = 0. Figure 3 is a plot of the normalized
stress intensity factor KI/σ0
√
pia versus the position of crack front x3/t. From this
plot we see that the present results well agree with the numerical results presented
in the literatures (Raju and Newmann, 1977; Li, et al., 1998; Sukumar, et al., 2000)
since all the deviations are below 4.03%.

9 A special boundary element for interface problems
Based upon the Green’s functions shown in (10), a special boundary element for in-
terface problems can be designed by following the standard procedure of boundary
element formulation (Brebbia, et al., 1984). To show the improvement of this spe-
cial boundary element, one typical example about the interface corners is presented
in this section.
Example 9: an edge interface corner between two dissimilar materials
Since the development of this special boundary element is for the improvement of
the computational accuracy and efficiency of interface problems, the example con-
sidered here is an interface edge corner (Figure 5) treated in our previous study
(Hwu and Kuo, 2007). The material above the interface is isotropic whose proper-
ties are: E = 10GPa and v= 0.2, and the material below the interface is orthotropic
whose properties are the same as those given in Example 1. The reference length
used in the definition (7) is selected to be b = 5mm.
The difference between the present example and our previous study comes from
the source of the displacement and traction vectors u and t of the actual system
needed in the calculation of H-integral (8). In our previous study u and t are calcu-
lated by the commercial finite element code ANSYS, while in the present example

Due to this difference we believe the present results shown in Table 3 is more accu-
rate than the one shown in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007). Note that in Table 3, r stands for
the radius of the circular path originated at the corner tip for the H-integral. In addi-
tion to the theoretical proof provided in (Hwu and Kuo, 2007), the path independent
property of H-integral can also be confirmed through this numerical computation
in which several different paths are used.
182 Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press CMC, vol.11, no.3, pp.165-183, 2009
intensity factors of interface corners and cracks which are usually defined inde-
pendently can now be discussed and compared under the same situation set by
the users. By numerical examples shown in this paper, the combination of special
boundary element and the path-independent H-integral is also proved to be a good
approach dealing with the interface problem.

Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric
Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element
Analysis
Y.C. Chen1 and Chyanbin Hwu2
Abstract: The Green’s function for anisotropic bimaterials has been investigated
around three decades ago. Since the mathematical formulation of piezoelectric
elasticity can be organized into the same form as that of anisotropic elasticity by just
expanding the dimension of the corresponding matrix to include the piezoelectric
effects, the extension of the Green’s function to piezoelectric bimaterials can be ob-
tained immediately through the associated anisotropic bimaterials. In this paper, the
Green’s function for the bimaterials bonded together with one anisotropic material
and one piezoelectric material is derived by applying Stroh’s complex variable for-
malism with the aid of analytical continuation method. For this problem, the inter-
facial condition of electric field depends on the electric conductivity of anisotropic
elastic materials. Employing these Green’s functions, a special boundary element
satisfying the interfacial continuity conditions of anisotropic/piezoelectric bimate-
rials is developed. With the embedded Green’s functions, this special boundary
element preserves two special features: (1) the interface continuity conditions are
satisfied exactly and no meshes are needed along the interface; (2) the materials be-
low and above the interface can be any kinds of piezoelectric or anisotropic elastic
materials. To show the advantages of the present special boundary element, sev-
eral numerical examples such as orthotropic/isotropic bimaterials, PZT-7A/PZT-5H
bimaterials and anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are illustrated and compared
with the solutions calculated by other numerical methods. The numerical results
show that the present special boundary element is not only accurate but also effi-
cient.

Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis33
special boundary elements, in this paper we further apply the Green’s functions for
anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials to improve the traditional boundary elements.
In this way, no meshes are needed along the interfaces and the materials below and
above the interface can be any kinds of piezoelectric or anisotropic elastic materi-
als. Since the continuity conditions have been satisfied exactly and no meshes are
needed along the interfaces, for the interface problems the present special bound-
ary element is much more accurate and efficient than the other numerical methods
such as finite element method and traditional boundary element method. These
advantages are confirmed through numerical examples for three different kinds of
bimaterials - orthotropic/isotropic, PZT-7A/PZT-5H and anisotropic/piezoelectric
bimaterials.

be, respectively, the displacement, stress, strain, electric displacement (or called
induction) and electric field. The constitutive laws, strain-displacement equations
and the equilibrium equations for anisotropic elasticity are [Ting (1996)]

(ui, j+u j,i), σi j, j = 0, i, j,k, l = 1,2,3 (1)
where repeated indices imply summation, a comma stands for differentiation. In
eqn.(1) the body forces are neglected and the elastic constants Ci jkl are assumed to
be fully symmetric and positive definite.
For piezoelectric anisotropic elasticity, to include the piezoelectric effects the con-
stitutive laws should be modified and the electrostatic equations should be consid-
ered, and hence the basic equations are modified as follows. [Rogacheva (1994)]

Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis35
3 Green’s Functions
3.1 Anisotropic bimaterials
Consider a bimaterial that consists of two dissimilar anisotropic elastic half-spaces.
Let the upper half-space x2 > 0 be occupied by material 1 and the lower half-
space x2 < 0 be occupied by material 2 (see Fig. 1). Assume these two dissimilar
materials are perfectly bonded along the interface x2 = 0. The Green’s function
for bimaterials is the elasticity solution for a bimaterial subjected to a concentrated
force pˆ applied at point xˆ= (xˆ1, xˆ2) of material 1. The boundary conditions of this
problem can be expressed as
u1 = u2, ±φ1 =±φ2, along the interface x2 = 0,∫
C
d±φ1 = pˆ for any closed curve C enclosing the point xˆ,
σi j→ 0 at infinity,

3.3 Anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials
In this subsection the anisotropic elastic materials are categorized into two kinds,
conductors and insulators. The electric field Ei of the conductors is considered to
be zero in the entire body, whereas the electric displacement Di of the insulators is
zero. With the relations u4, j =−E j, φ4,1 =D2 and φ4,2 =−D1 given in (4) and (8),
we know that the electric continuity conditions for the conductors and insulators
can be represented, respectively, by u4 = 0 and φ4 = 0 along the interface.
Case (i): the anisotropic material is a conductor
Consider a bimaterial whose upper half-space x2 > 0 (region S1) is occupied by a
piezoelectric material and the lower half-space x2 < 0 (region S2) is occupied by an
anisotropic elastic conductor. If a point force/charge pˆ=(pˆ1, pˆ2, pˆ3, qˆ)T is applied
at point xˆ = (xˆ1, xˆ2) of material 1, the boundary conditions along the interface can
be written as
u(1)i = u
(2)
i , φ
(1)
i = φ
(2)
i , i= 1,2,3, u
(1)
4 = 0, along the interface x2 = 0. (14)
The equilibrium and infinity conditions can still be expressed by using the last two
equations of (10). To find the solution satisfying all the boundary conditions, we
first assume the solution be expressed in the form of eqn.(11) whose complex func-
tion vectors f1(z(1)) and f2(z(2)) will be determined through the use of analytical
continuation method. f0(z(1)) that represents the Green’s function of homogeneous
materials is still the one given in the first equations of (12).
With the general solutions given in (11), the boundary conditions (14) may now be
written as
Ae1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ A¯
e
1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = A2f2(x1)+ A¯2f2(x1),
Be1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ B¯
e
1[f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = B2f2(x1)+ B¯2f2(x1),
Ap1 [f0(x1)+ f1(x1)]+ A¯
p
1 [f0(x1)+ f1(x1)] = 0,
(15)
where Ae1 and B
e
1 are two 3×4 matrices, Ap1 and Bp1 are two 1×4 matrices, and they
are the submatrices of A1 and B1 defined by
A1 =
[
Ae1
Ap1
]
, B1 =
[
Be1
Bp1
]
. (16)
The dimensions of the other vectors and matrices are f0, f1 : 4× 1, f2 : 3× 1 and
A2,B2 : 3×3.
One of the important properties of the holomorphic functions is that f1(z¯) will be
holomorphic in S2 if f1(z) is holomorphic in S1. Similarly, f0(z¯) and f2(z¯) will be
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis39
f1(z) and f2(z) can be obtained by substituting (12)1 into (19a) and employing the
translation technique. The results are
f1(z(1)) =

(19)
Case (ii): the anisotropic material is an insulator
Same situation as case (i) is considered here except that the conductor of material
2 is now replaced by an insulator. With this replacement, the boundary conditions
along the interface can be written as
u(1)i = u
(2)
i , φ
(1)
i = φ
(2)
i , i= 1,2,3, φ
(1)
4 = 0, along the interface x2 = 0. (20)
By a similar approach as case (i), the explicit full field solutions of f1(z) and f2(z)
can be obtained as follows.

3.4 Discussions
From the above solutions we see that Green’s functions of the anisotropic bima-
terials and piezoelectric bimaterials have exactly the same mathematical forms,
whereas those of the anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are different. Since piezo-
electric materials can be specialized to anisotropic materials by neglecting their
piezoelectric constants, it is expected that Green’s functions of anisotropic /piezo-
electric bimaterials may be reduced from those of piezoelectric bimaterials through
the specialization of piezoelectric tensor and dielectric permittivity tensor. From
the constitutive relations shown in (2), we observe that the alternative solutions of
(20) and (22) can be obtained from the Green’s function of piezoelectric bimateri-
als by letting eki j = 0 and ωεi j→ ∞ for conductors, and letting eki j = 0 and ωεi j→ 0
for insulators.
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis41
we can now write down the results of T∗ and U∗ as
T∗ =
{
2Re{ [Bα(F0,s+F1,s)]T}, if ξ ∈ S1,x ∈ S1, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S2,
2Re{[BαF2,s]T}, if ξ ∈ S1,x ∈ S2, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S1,
U∗ =
{
2Re{ [Aα(F0+F1)]T}, if xˆ ∈ S1,x ∈ S1, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S2,
2Re{[AαF2]T}, if ξˆ ∈ S1,ξ ∈ S2, or ξ ∈ S2,x ∈ S1,
(25)
in which the subscript α = 1, if x∈ S1 and α = 2, if x∈ S2.F0,F1and F2 are related
to f0(z(α)), f1(z(α)) and f2(z(α)) obtained in Section 3 by
f0(z(α)) = F0pˆ, f1(z(α)) = F1pˆ, f2(z(α)) = F2pˆ. (26)
5 Boundary Element Formulation
After getting the fundamental solutions in (26), the unknowns remained in the
boundary integral equations (25) are u and t over the boundary Γ. In boundary
element formulation, the boundary Γ is approximated by a series of elements, and
the points x, displacements u and tractions t on the boundary are approximated by
the nodal points xn, nodal displacement un and nodal traction tn through different
interpolation functions. In this paper, we assume the same linear variation within
each element for the boundary points x, displacements u and tractions t. Thus, the
values of x, u and t at any point on the mth element can be defined in terms of their
nodal values and two linear interpolation functions ϖ1 and ϖ2 of the dimensionless
coordinate ς , such that
x= ϖ1x
(1)
m +ϖ2x
(2)
m , u= ϖ1u
(1)
m +ϖ2u
(2)
m , t= ϖ1t
(1)
m +ϖ2t
(2)
m , (27)
where a symbol with subscript m and superscript (1) or (2) denotes the value of
node 1 or 2 of the mth element. The interpolation functions ϖ1 and ϖ2 are given by
ϖ1 =
1
2
(1− ς), ϖ2 = 12(1+ ς), (28)
where ς is the dimensionless coordinate defined by ς = 2s/`m in which `m is the
length of the mth element and s is the coordinate lying along the linear element and
directed from the first node to the second node of element m.
If the boundary Γ is discretized into M segments with N nodes, substitution of (28)
Green’s Functions for Anisotropic/Piezoelectric Bimaterials and Their Applications to Boundary Element Analysis43
Consider ξ to be the location of node i and use Ci,ui, Yˆin,Gin to denote the values
of C,u, Yˆn,Gn at node i. Equation (34) can now be expressed as
N
∑
n=1
Yinun =
N
∑
n=1
Gintn, i= 1,2, ...,N, (34a)
in which
Yin =Yˆin, for i 6= n,
Yin =Yˆin+Ci, for i= n.
(34b)
When all the nodes are taken into consideration, equation (35a) produces a 3N×3N
system of equations. By applying the boundary condition such that either ui or ti
at each node is prescribed, the system of equations (35a) can be reordered in such
a way that the final system of equations can be expressed as Kv=p where K is a
fully populated matrix, v is a vector containing all the boundary unknowns and p
is a vector containing all the prescribed values given on the boundary. Once (35a)
has been solved, all the values of tractions and displacements on the boundary
are determined. With this result, the values of stresses and displacements at any
interior point can be calculated through the strain-displacement relation and the
stress-strain law shown in eqns. (1) and (2).
6 Numerical Examples
To show the advantages of the present special boundary element method (SBEM),
in this section several numerical examples such as orthotropic/isotropic, PZT-7A/PZT-
5H and anisotropic/piezoelectric bimaterials are illustrated.
Example 1. orthotropic/isotropic bimaterials
An orthotropic/isotropic bimaterial subjected to uniform tension σˆ = 1MPa is con-
sidered in this example. The loading, geometry and boundary element meshes of
this problem are shown in Fig. 2. The material above the interface is orthotropic
whose mechanical properties are:
E11 = 134.45GPa, E22 = E33 = 11.03GPa, v12 = v13 = 0.301, v23 = 0.49,
G12 = G13 = 5.84GPa, G23 = 2.98GPa,
and the material below the interface is isotropic whose properties are E = 10GPa
and v = 0.2. Fig. 3 shows the results of stresses along the interface. From this
figure we see that the stresses calculated from the finite element software ANSYS
are discontinuous across the interface, which will approach to a continuous value

With the aid of the elastic–viscoelastic correspondence principle, the boundary element developed for
the linear anisotropic elastic solids can be applied directly to the linear anisotropic viscoelastic solids in
the Laplace domain. Green’s functions for the problems of two-dimensional linear anisotropic elastic
solids containing holes, cracks, inclusions, or interfaces have been obtained analytically using Stroh’s
complex variable formalism. Through the use of these Green’s functions and the correspondence
principle, special boundary elements in the Laplace domain for viscoelastic solids containing holes,
cracks, inclusions, or interfaces are developed in this paper. Subregion technique is employed when
multiple holes, cracks, inclusions, and interfaces exist simultaneously. After obtaining the physical
responses in Laplace domain, their associated values in time domain are calculated by the numerical
inversion of Laplace transform. The main feature of this proposed boundary element is that no meshes
are needed along the boundary of holes, cracks, inclusions and interfaces whose boundary conditions
are satisﬁed exactly. To show this special feature by comparison with the other numerical methods,
several examples are solved for the linear isotropic viscoelastic materials under plane strain condition.
The results show that the present BEM is really more efﬁcient and accurate for the problems of
viscoelastic solids containing interfaces, holes, cracks, and/or inclusions.

1. Introduction
Viscoelastic materials exhibit a time and rate dependence that
is completely absent in the elastic materials. Due to the inclusion
of time as an independent variable, the available exact analytical
solutions have been obtained only for a few simpliﬁed problems.
Thus, to study the mechanical behavior of viscoelastic solids, the
numerical approaches such as ﬁnite element method (FEM) and
boundary element method (BEM) are normally needed. The main
advantages of BEM are the reduction of the problem dimension by
one and the exact satisfaction of certain boundary conditions for
particular problems if their associated fundamental solutions are
embedded in boundary element formulation. Generally, there are
three different approaches to linear viscoelastic analysis by BEM.
The ﬁrst formulates a BEM in Laplace transform domain and
obtain the solution in time domain by numerical inversion [1,2].
The second formulates a BEM directly in time domain [3–5].
Although the second approach looks more direct and efﬁcient, but
the lack of fundamental solutions in time domain restricts the
applicability of time domain BEM approach. To combine the
advantages of the previous two approaches, a mixed BEM was
proposed by Schanz [6], which can solve the problem in time
domain but rely on the fundamental solutions in Laplace domain.
Through the use of correspondence principle, the viscoelastic
solids can be effectively treated in Laplace domain. To take
advantage of the available fundamental solutions for the defects
or interfaces in anisotropic elastic materials [7], in this paper we
choose the ﬁrst approach, i.e., the transformed BEM to treat the
problems of viscoelastic solids containing defects such as holes,
cracks or inclusions, or interfaces. Using the subregion technique
[8], the problems with simultaneous existence of multiple holes,
cracks, inclusions, and interfaces can also be treated without too
much extra works. The main feature of this proposed method is
that no meshes are needed along the boundary of defects and
interfaces whose boundary conditions are satisﬁed exactly, which
means that the present approach should be more efﬁcient and
accurate. To show this special feature, several examples consider-
ing interfaces, holes, cracks, and/or inclusions are illustrated in
this paper. For the purpose of comparison, some examples are
taken from those treated by the other BEM methods such as a
circular elastic inclusion in an isotropic viscoelastic solid simu-
lated by Kelvin model [9], an elliptical hole in an isotropic
viscoelastic solid simulated by generalized Kelvin model [1],
and a center-cracked plate in an isotropic viscoelastic solid under
plane strain condition [10]. As to the interface problems, the

In the case of an isotropic medium characterized by the shear
and bulk relaxation functions—G(t) and k(t), the elastic stiffness
tensor Cijkl(t) can be written as
CijklðtÞ ¼ kðtÞ23GðtÞ

where dij is the Kronecker delta. For the elastic materials, Young’s
modulus E and Poisson’s ratio n are related to shear modulus G
and bulk modulus k by [17]

If the isotropic medium is represented by G and n, Young’s

The relations of these constants in time domain can then be
obtained through (2.15) using Laplace inversion.
Note that like the two-dimensional problems of anisotropic
elasticity, the above formulations are for the cases of generalized
plane strain. For the problems of generalized plane stress, the
transformed elastic stiffnesses Cij and the reduced transformed
elastic compliances S
r
ij should be replaced, respectively, by the
reduced transformed elastic stiffnesses C
r
ij and the transformed
elastic compliances Sij.
2.2. Numerical inversion of Laplace transform
After getting the displacements ui, stress functions
fi and
stresses s ij in Laplace transform domain from (2.6) and (2.7), their
associated solutions in real time domain can be determined by
numerical inversion of Laplace transform. In this study, Schapery
method [18] is adopted to transfer a series of data in Laplace
domain into time domain. If a function f(t) is represented by
f ðtÞ ¼ AþBtþ
Xm
k ¼ 1
ake
bkt , ð2:16Þ
where A,B,ak and bk are constant in time and m is an arbitrary
number of terms in the exponential series, the Laplace transform
of (2.16) gives
sf ðsÞ ¼ Aþ B
s
þ
Xm
k ¼ 1
aks
sþbk
: ð2:17Þ
If the function values in Laplace domain are calculated for a
sequence of values s¼s1,s2,y,smþ2, and the powers of the
exponential functions in (2.16), bk, are assumed to be equal to
sk, then a system of mþ2 linear algebraic equations can be set to
solve the mþ2 unknown constants A, B and ak, k¼1,2,y,m. The
function values in time domain can therefore be calculated
through (2.16).
Note that the computation of the inverse Laplace transform is
required only for magnitudes and points of interest, e.g., stresses
and displacements at a stress concentration point.
3. Boundary element formulation in Laplace transform
domain
For viscoelastic analysis, several different boundary element
methods have been published in the literature. Generally, they
can be classiﬁed into three classes: BEM in transform domain,
BEM in time domain, and mixed formulation. In order to take
advantage of using the fundamental solutions of the correspond-
ing elasticity problems obtained in the literature for the problems
with holes, crack, inclusions and interfaces, in this study we only
consider BEM in transform domain.
By using the correspondence principle, the boundary integral
equations in Laplace domain of a linear viscoelastic body are
equivalent to those of linear elastic body, i.e.,
cijðn,sÞ ujðn,sÞ ¼
Z
G
½ uijðn,x,sÞt jðx,sÞt

ijðn,x,sÞ ujðx,sÞdGðxÞ, i,j¼ 1,2,3,
ð3:1Þ
where G denotes the boundary of the elastic solid; ujðx,sÞ and
t jðx,sÞ are the Laplace transform of the displacements and surface
tractions along the boundaries; uijðn,x,sÞ and t

ijðn,x,sÞ are the
fundamental solutions of the corresponding elastic problem for
displacements and tractions in which the elastic constants have
been replaced by s CijklðsÞ; cij(x,s) is a coefﬁcient dependent on the
location of n and the time-varied material properties, which
equals to dij/2 for a smooth boundary and cij¼dij for an
internal point.
3.1. Fundamental solutions for regular boundary elements
For regular boundary elements, the fundamental solutions
uijðn,x,sÞ and t

ijðn,x,sÞ are, respectively, the displacements and
tractions in the xj direction at point x¼(x1,x2) corresponding to a
unit point force acting in the xi direction applied at point
n¼ ðx^1,x^2Þ of the two-dimensional inﬁnite plate with material
properties s CijklðsÞ. Their solutions can be found from the corre-
sponding anisotropic elastic problems [7]. Written in matrix form,
i.e., U ¼ ½ uij and T ¼ ½t

ij, we have
U ¼ 2Ref½AFðzÞT g, T ¼ 2Ref½BF,rðzÞTg, ð3:2aÞ

3.4. Subregion technique
Since several different special boundary elements are consid-
ered in this paper, in real applications we may employ the
subregion technique to combine all these special boundary ele-
ments to treat the problems of anisotropic viscoelastic bodies
containing multiple interfaces, holes, cracks, and inclusions. By
this technique, each subregion contains only one interface, hole,
crack, or inclusion. The ﬁnal system of equations for the whole
region is obtained by adding the set of equations for each
subregion together with compatibility and equilibrium conditions
between their interfaces. Detailed formulation about the subre-
gion technique can be found in [8,19].
4. Numerical examples
The special feature of the BEM proposed in this paper is that
the fundamental solutions used in BEM of Laplace transformed
domain satisfy the boundary conditions of traction-free hole/
crack, perfect-bonded inclusion/interface exactly. Thus, for the
problems of viscoelastic solids containing interfaces, holes, cracks,
and/or inclusions, no meshes are needed along the boundaries of
interfaces, holes, cracks and inclusions, and the remaining meshes
along the outer boundaries of the solids can be made by relatively
rough discretization. Due to the exact satisfaction of the boundary
conditions along the interfaces, holes, cracks, and/or inclusions,
the proposed BEM is not only efﬁcient but also more accurate
than the other BEMs proposed in the literature. To show this
special feature, several examples considering interfaces, holes,
cracks, and/or inclusions are illustrated in this Section. Although
the present BEM is applicable for the general linear anisotropic
viscoelastic materials, for the purpose of comparison only the
linear isotropic viscoelastic materials under plane strain condition
are considered in the following examples. Since the boundary
elements proposed in this paper are extended from the corre-
sponding problems of elastostatics, only the applied load with the
type of Heaviside step function of time is considered in the
following numerical examples.
Convergence study of Laplace inversion
Since the proposed BEM is performed in Laplace transform
domain, the numerical inversion of Laplace transform stated in
Section 2 is necessary to get the physical responses in time
domain. From (2.16) and (2.17) we see that the approximation
of the numerical inversion depends upon the selection of the
transformed variables [20]. To know how to select the trans-
formed variables properly, before executing the BEM a simple
example on the Laplace inversion of shear relaxation function G(t)
is considered as follows. If G(t) is known to be
GðtÞ ¼ G1þðG0G1Þet=t, ð4:1Þ
where G0 and GN are, respectively, the shear moduli at the initial
and ﬁnal states, and parameter t is the relaxation time that
determines the rate of decay, its Laplace transform is
GðsÞ ¼ G1
s
þ ðG0G1Þ
sþ1=t : ð4:2Þ
By taking (4.2) as a known function, its inversion (4.1) may be
approximated by (2.16) through suitable selection of the trans-
formed variables s1,s2,y,smþ2 to solve the unknown constants A,
B and ak, k¼1,2,y,m (bk are assumed to be equal to sk). With this
understanding, the transformed variables s1,s2,y,smþ2 are sug-
gested to be selected as
sk ¼ 10wk , k¼ 1,2,. . .,mþ2, ð4:3aÞ
where
w1 ¼2log10t, Dw¼
4log10t
mþ1 ,
wk ¼ w1þðk1ÞDw, k¼ 2,3,. . .,mþ2: ð4:3bÞ
This selection will ensure s1o1/tosmþ2. Fig. 1 shows the
comparison for the case with G0/GN¼2.19 and t¼10 s. From
Fig. 1we see that the approximation will be improved when more
transformed variables are used, i.e., for larger m. When the exact
solution can be described by the exponential function like (4.1)
considered in this example, if the powers of the exponential
function can be covered by the selected transformed variables like
m¼3 of Fig. 1 whose s2¼0.1¼1/t no matter how small of m the
numerical inversion will always offer the best approximation.
Due to the success of this simple example, in the following
examples all the numerical inversion will be performed through
the selection of (4.3) with m¼18.
Example 1: a circular elastic inclusion
For the purpose of comparison, a problem considered by
Huang et al. [9] for an isotropic viscoelastic solid containing a
circular elastic inclusion subjected to uniform stresses at inﬁnity
is re-solved by the present BEM (see Fig. 2). In [9], the viscoelastic
materials are simulated by the Kelvin model whose stresses and
strains are related by the following differential constitutive

Fig. 7 shows the results of crack opening displacements obtai-
ned by the present BEM with 8 elements, the time domain BEM
presented by Syngellakis and Wu [10] with 432 elements, and the
commercial ﬁnite element software ANSYS with 14,482 elements
(PLANE183). From this ﬁgure we see that all these results well agree
with each other. The difference is that only 8 elements are needed
for the present BEM to get an accurate solution, while ﬁne meshes
are needed for the other two methods. For the present BEM no
meshes are needed along the cracks since the traction-free boundary
conditions of crack surfaces are satisﬁed exactly through the special
fundamental solution introduced in (3.4), whereas ﬁne meshes are
usually needed along the cracks for the other BEM or FEM.
Fig. 8 shows the normal stresses sy along the crack surface at
t¼0. From this ﬁgure, we see that the results obtained by ANSYS
cannot satisfy the traction-free boundary condition even very ﬁne
meshes (14,482 elements) are made. Although ANSYS’s inaccu-
racy of stresses will not inﬂuence the accuracy of the crack
opening displacements shown in Fig. 7, it indeed inﬂuences the
calculation of the stress intensity factors. Fig. 9 shows the results
of the mode I stress intensity factors KI calculated by the
following deﬁnition:
KI ¼ lim
r-0
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2pr
p
syðr,0Þ ð4:8Þ
Due to the inaccuracy of the normal stress sy provided by the
ANSYS, unstable results are obtained for KI when the distance to
the crack tip r approaches to zero. However, with the normal
stress sy obtained from the present BEM, stable results are
obtained for KI.
Example 4: an interface
Consider a bimaterial made by two dissimilar isotropic viscoe-
lastic materials subjected to uniform tension s0 at two ends
(Fig. 10). Like example 3, both of the materials can be character-
ized by a shear relaxation function G(t) shown in (4.1) and a
constant bulk modulus k, in which the related parameters are
Material 1: G0 ¼ 5:81GPa, G1 ¼ 2:65GPa, t¼ 10s, k¼ 12:59GPa,
Material 2: G0 ¼ 1:31GPa, G1 ¼ 0:13GPa, t¼ 0:1s, k¼ 2:84GPa:
Fig. 11 shows the variation of the stresses sy at point (0.14,0)m
for the time period 0rtr120 s, from which we see that the
stresses above and below the interface calculated by ANSYS
(PLANE183) are discontinuous, which is incorrect and will
approach to the values calculated by the present BEM when ﬁne
meshes are used near the interfaces. On the other hand, the
solutions obtained from the present BEM will always provide
continuous stresses across the interface. Fig. 12 shows the varia-
tion of the stresses sy at time t¼10 s along the interface
(0rx1r0.15,x2¼0)m by using 14,400 elements for ANSYS and
80 elements for the present BEM, from which we see that the

matrix and ﬁber in Laplace domain. By using (4.9)–(4.11) to get
the solutions of effective Young’s modulus EðsÞ in Laplace domain,
and using (2.16) and (2.17) for numerical inversion of Laplace
transform, we can get the comparison results plotted in Fig. 14.
Through this comparison we see that the results calculated by
three different approaches well agree with each other for the
small ﬁber volume fraction (vf¼4%), whereas the results of
present BEM and Mori–Tanaka equation are much closer than
the results of Halpin–Tsai equation for higher ﬁber volume
fraction (vf¼55%).
The superiority in efﬁciency and accuracy of the present
approach has been shown through the above typical examples.
To save the space of this paper, its versatility in engineering
applications are not presented here. One may refer to [22] for
some application examples such as the interface corners between
two dissimilar viscoelastic materials, an elliptical inclusion inside
an anisotropic viscoelastic material, and the simultaneous exis-
tence of inclusions, cracks, and holes in viscoelastic solids.
5. Conclusions
The special boundary elements developed in this paper are
applicable for the two-dimensional problems containing holes,
cracks, inclusions, and/or interfaces. The materials can be anisotro-
pic elastic or viscoelastic. While no further step is needed for the
problems with elastic materials, numerical Laplace inversion is
needed to get the solutions in time domain for the problems with
viscoelastic materials. Although the numerical inversion may raise
the concerns of inaccuracy and time-consuming, the numerical
examples illustrated in this paper show that their merits due to
the exact satisfaction of boundary conditions overtake the possible
drawbacks induced by the numerical inversion.

behaviors of open-tip CNCs under axial strains (including
tensile strains and compressive strains) were investigated in
this study with the aid of the MD simulations. Tensile be-
haviors (such as the failure strain, failure loads, and failure
modes) and compressive behaviors (such as the critical
strains, critical loads, and buckling modes) of the CNCs
were studied. The inﬂuences of temperature, cone height,
and apex angle on the behaviors were examined in the
study. In contrast to fewer related works to this study, there
are plenty of research works on tensile and compres-
sive behaviors of CNTs. The examples are the pioneering
studies by Yakobson et al.22,23 They ﬁrst investigated
compression instabilities of CNTs under large deformation22
and then examined the tensile failure of CNTs23 via the MD
simulations. Inﬂuences of temperature on the breaking strain
were also discussed in the later research work. Because
CNCs have structures similar to those of CNTs, results of
the above studies can be utilized for comparison of the
behaviors of CNCs and CNTs.
The simulation method and veriﬁcation of the present
method are described in the following section.
II. SIMULATION METHOD AND MODEL
A. Simulation method
The MD simulations were used in this study. In the
simulations, the Tersoff bond-order potential was selected
to model interactions of carbon atoms of the CNCs because
it is very efﬁcient in the simulations of CNC systems.19 The
Tersoff bond-order potential can be expressed as24,25
V 5 +
i
+
j. i
Vij ; ð1Þ
where V is the potential energy of the CNC system; Vij is
the bond energy of atoms i and j, which can be written as
Vij5 fcðrijÞ½VRðrijÞ þ bijVAðrijÞ ; ð2Þ
in which fc(rij) represents a smooth cutoff function, rij is
the distance between atoms i and j, and VR(rij) and VA(rij)
are the repulsive and attractive energies between atoms i
and j, respectively. The function bij is the bond order of
atoms i and j and is the feature of the Tersoff bond-order
potential. Expressions of the above functions and their
related parameters can be obtained from the literature.25
With the potential function of Eq. (1), interaction
forces between the carbon atoms can be calculated from
the gradient of the potential function. The equations of
motion for the CNC system can then be set with the aid of
the interaction forces. Through integrating the equations
of motion, evolution of each atom of the system can
be attained, from which behaviors of the system can
be evaluated via statistical analysis. In this study, NVT
(canonical) ensembles were used for the statistical analy-
sis. For efﬁciency of the simulations, the velocity rescaling
method26,27 was utilized as the thermostat during the
simulations. Besides, the velocity Verlet algorithm26,27
with a time step of 1 fs (1015 s) was selected for the
integration of the equations of motion.
B. Simulation model and verification of the model
In this study, a displacement control method was used
to simulate the axial strains (including tensile strains and
compressive strains) applied on the CNCs. The simula-
tion model is illustrated in Fig. 1. The open-tip CNC has
an apex angle h, top radius Rt, bottom radius Rb, and cone
heightH (the height from the position of the bottom radius
to that of the top radius). It was partitioned into several
regions. The uppermost region is a moving layer, in which
atoms are displaced gradually in the axial direction at
a very small and constant speed away from (or toward) the
bottom of the CNC to simulate the tensile (or compressive)
strains. The lowest region is a ﬁxed layer, in which atoms
are ﬁxed during the simulations. Next to the moving layer
and the ﬁxed layer, there are thermal layers, in which
atoms act as a thermostat and are subjected to the thermal
control method. The remaining region is a free layer, in
which atoms are free to evolve without any constraint
during the simulations. Height of the moving layer, the
ﬁxed layer, and each thermal layer is set as a tenth of the
total height of the CNC. As a result, the regions subjected
to axial strains are the thermal layers and the free layer.
It should be noted that, during the simulations, po-
sitions of the ﬁxed layer atoms were ﬁxed (unmovable) to
model the ﬁxture applied on the CNC during the applica-
tion of axial strains. Positions of the moving layer atoms
were speciﬁed by a constant displacement rate to model the
FIG. 1. Simulation model of this study.

oscillating greatly at high temperatures and increase
difﬁculty of the MD simulations. To diminish the difﬁculty
and to obtain more stable results, the displacement rate of
the moving layer was reduced to 0.1 m/s in this example.
For ease of comparison and discussion, this displacement
rate was also utilized in the following examples.
The average strain energy and internal axial force
versus the average tensile strain of the CNC at various
temperatures are plotted in Fig. 3. The average strain
energy was calculated by averaging the strain energy of
atoms in the thermal layers and the free layer (i.e., in the
strained regions). The internal axial force was determined
by summing the forces in the axial direction acting on
the atoms in the upper thermal layer and the free layer by
the atoms in the moving layer. It was noticed from the
ﬁgure that the failure tensile strain and the failure average
strain energy of the CNC decrease evidently with an
increase in the temperature. The failure strain decreases
from 25.5% at temperature 1 K to 20.2% at temperature
500 K. The corresponding internal axial force decreases
from 91.3 to 70.7 eV/Å. Oscillation of the internal force
because of the increase in kinetic energy becomes apparent
as the temperature increases. Moreover, from curves of the
internal axial force versus the average tensile strain, no
obvious yielding was observed before the failure of the
CNC.
Figure 4 shows the average strain energy and internal
axial force versus the average tensile strain of the CNCs at
temperature 300 K with different cone heights of 40, 50,
and 60 Å (i.e., with H/Rt of 8, 10, and 12, respectively).

The critical strain and the critical average strain energy were
noticed to decrease with the increase in the cone height. For
the CNCs with cone heights of 40, 50, and 60 Å, the
corresponding critical strains are 4.63, 4.13, and 3.83%,
respectively. The antibuckling ability of the CNCs decreases
as the cone height increases, namely, as the slenderness ratio
increases. It was also noted that variation in the critical loads
is not clear (range 34.4–36.8 eV/Å). Similar behaviors were
also observed for the cases at the different temperatures. The
nonuniform radius along the cone axis also results in these
behaviors. Buckling modes of the three CNCs are plotted in
Fig. 9(b).The buckling modes exhibit a slightly different
pattern. With larger cone height, the CNC displays a more
distorted buckling pattern. This is ascribed to the increase in
the slenderness ratio (H/Rt) of the cone structure.
For inspection of inﬂuences of the apex angle on
compressive behaviors of the CNC, three open-tip CNCs
with the same top radius of 5 Å and cone height of 30 Å
but different apex angles of 19.2, 38.9, and 60°, respec-
tively, were studied. The system temperature was also set
to be 1 K. The average strain energy and internal axial
force versus the average compressive strain for the three
CNCs are compared in Fig. 8. It was found that the critical
strain of the CNCs decreases with an increase in the apex
angle. For the CNCs with apex angles of 19.2, 38.9, and
60°, the corresponding critical strains are 5.25, 3.83, and
3.46%, respectively. The corresponding critical load also
decreases with the expansion of the apex angle (with
values of 36.8, 30.3, and 27.3 eV/Å, respectively). Re-
duction in rigidity in the axial direction because of the

mode does not have much variation when the temperature
increases. As the cone height enlarges, the buckling mode
displays a more distorted buckling pattern because of the
increase in the slenderness. Moreover, with the expansion
of the apex angle, the buckling mode transfers from an
axisymmetric pattern for the CNC with the smallest apex
angle (19.2°) to an unsymmetrical and more warped pattern
because of the reduction in rigidity of the CNC.
As mentioned previously, owing to their special cone
shape, CNCs are particularly suitable for use as scanning
probe tips, electron ﬁeld emitters, and nanoindenters.
Concerning these applications, the resolution for scan-
ning probe tips and nanoindenters and the turn-on power
for electron ﬁeld emitters are the critical factors affecting
their performance. Besides, mechanical behaviors (such
as the antibuckling ability) of the CNCs must also be
considered. After concerning the above factors, the CNC
with the smallest apex angle (19.2°) is the best candidate
for these applications because it can provide the most
favorable characteristics among the ﬁve CNCs. However,
the tip of the closed 19.2° CNC is very sharp and ﬂexible
for the use in the applications. The open-tip 19.2° CNC
may offer an alternative for the applications. This study
has investigated the inﬂuences of several factors on tensile
and compressive behaviors of open-tip CNCs. The results
of the study might provide some information that is useful
for these applications of CNCs.

An Analytical Molecular Mechanics Model for Mechanical 
Properties of General Elastic Solids
Chyanbin Hwu and Yu-Kuei Yeh
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, TAIWAN, R.O.C.
An analytical model based on continuum mechanics as well as molecular mechanics is proposed to estimate the
mechanical properties of general elastic solids which may be in macro, micro or nano scale.
Analytical Molecular Mechanics Model
Through the as made experimental state such as the assumed tensile or pure shear state, the deformed position of each atom of the test specimen can be determined by the
theory of elasticity. With the knowledge of the undeformed and deformed positions of each atom, the bond distance and bond angles between atoms which are essential for the
calculation of potential energy in molecular mechanics can be obtained. By treating this potential energy as the strain energy of deformed solids, the mechanical properties can
then be determined through the differentiation of strain energy with respect to strains.
1. Write down the position of 
each atom in term of 
Cartesian Coordinate
2. Consider a constant-strain 
deformation
3. Calculate the deformed 
position of each atom
4. Calculate the stretching 
change and angle change of 
each bond
5. Calculate the potential 
energy
6. Calculate the elastic 
constants Cij
7. Transform the elastic 
constants to engineering 
constants
Evaluation of Mechanical Properties
Verification of the concept and derivation procedure proposed in this paper is then made by the examples whose solutions have been provided in the literature such as the
Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for coppers, graphites, and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT). Furthermore, analytical solutions derived by the other methods,
experimental results measured by atomic force microscopy, and numerical results simulated by molecular dynamics or finite element modeling for general elastic solids will all
be compared in our future work to see the appropriateness of the present analytical model.
