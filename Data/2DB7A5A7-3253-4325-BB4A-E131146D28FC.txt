circumvented easily. Especially, the meshless 
numerical methods are very popular in recent 
years. The MFS is one of the meshless 
numerical methods, which can be used to solve 
the homogeneous solutions of partial 
differential equations. It is stemmed from the 
well-known indirect boundary integral equation 
(BIE) method. In addition, the MFS is free 
from numerical integrations as well as 
singularities. 
The MFS has already been applied to 
many partial differential equations successfully. 
These equations include the Poisson equation, 
diffusion equation, Stokes equations, 
Cauchy-Navier equations, biharmonic equation, 
Helmholtz equation, etc. Theoretically 
speaking, the MFS is able to solve any partial 
differential equations once the fundamental 
solutions of the equations exist. In the last few 
decades, the applications of BIE for Reissner 
plates with and without Winkler or Pasternak 
foundations are intensively researched. In this 
project, we consider the MFS for these plate 
problems. 
On the other hand, in the applications of 
meshless numerical methods particular 
solutions of partial differential equations are 
usually treated either by the dual reciprocity 
method or analytical method. In this project, 
the arbitrary distributed loadings are 
approximated by augmented polyharmonic 
functions, which include polyharmonic splines 
and augmented polynomials. The particular 
solutions corresponding to these functions will 
all be derived analytically.  
After all, the results of the present project 
including the developments and 
implementations of the MFS-DRM for the 
prescribed three problems. They are submitted 
to international journals and a international 
conference on in Hawaii under the support of 
present grant.

二、研究目的與文獻探討 
In the numerical solutions for partial 
differential equations, it is well known that the 
finite difference method (FDM), the finite 
element method (FEM), and the boundary 
element method (BEM) are well-established 
numerical techniques for computational 
mechanics. However, the FDM usually requires 
an orthogonal mesh system, which makes it 
very difficult to model irregular domains. On 
the other hand, the generation of mesh is 
inevitable when the FEM and the BEM are 
adopted to handle scientific and engineering 
problems. In order to seek a more general 
method that can overcome the difficulties of 
mesh generation, meshless or mesh-free 
techniques have recently become quite popular 
in many interdisciplinary fields. In general, the 
meshless methods can be divided into two 
categories, the boundary-type and the 
domain-type. Two popular schemes in the 
domain-type category are the so-called Kansa’s 
method [1] stemmed from radial basis 
functions (RBFs) and the so-called meshless 
local Petrov-Galerkin method (MLPG) [2]. On 
the other hand, the method of fundamental 
solutions (MFS) is one of the popular methods 
in the boundary-type category, and will be 
considered in this project. 
In the MFS, the approximate numerical 
solution for a given problem is assumed to be a 
linear combination of the fundamental 
solutions with respect to source points that are 
located on an artificial boundary. The MFS 
retains the advantages of the BEM in which the 
solution procedure does not require the 
discretization of the interior domain, but at the 
same time the method overcomes the problem 
of singularity and also avoids the element 
integrations. Since the MFS does not require 
mesh discretization of the interior region of the 
computational domain, a significant amount of 
computational effort and time is saved 
compared to the domain discretization methods. 
Due to its simplicity in implementation the 
MFS has been applied successfully to deal with 
different types of boundary value problems as 
discussed in References [3-6]. The MFS is first 
proposed by Kupradze and Aleksidze in 1964 
[7]. Later, the MFS for biharmonic equations in 
the interior domains had been investigated by 
Karageorghis and Fairweather [8]. Also, 
Golberg [9] and Golberg & Chen [5] used the
