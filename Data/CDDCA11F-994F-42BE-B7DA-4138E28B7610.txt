II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a multiuser downlink channel with two BSs lo-
cated at the adjacent cells. There are M users, expressed as
UE11, UE
2
1, . . . ,UE
M
1 , at the cell-edge serviced by eNB1, and
M users, UE12, UE
2
2, . . . , UE

eNB2, illustrated in figure 1. Each BS equipped MT transmit

antennas, and each user with MR receiver antennas. Let Hmiij
be the MR by MT channel matrix from eNBj to UEmii , and
xi be the L × 1 message vector. T k is the precoding matrix
for UEmkk . We expect to find two users UE
m1
1 and UE
m2
2 that
are serviced by eNB1 and eNB2, respectively, using the same
resource blocks, in such a way that, the two users can achieve
the maximum sum of data rates to increase system throughput.
For the given two users, our system model can be simplified
like this:
Fig. 2. Coordinated scheduling beam forming for two-user MIMO with ICI.
The received signals of UEm11 and UE
m2
2 are given by

where n1 and n2 are MR × 1 i.i.d. zero-mean complex
Gaussian noise vectors with covariance matrix E[n1nH1 ] =
E[n2nH2 ] = N0I . The second item in the right-hand side
of the received signal by UEmkk is the ICI from another
collaborating BS. How to select the users UEm11 and UE
m2
2
from each BS with less interference is a problem worth
exploring.
One common technique to mitigate the interference is using
the precoding matrix which shapes the transmitted signal to
the channel realization. We would discuss some of precoding
schemes in next Section.
III. PRECODING MATRIX DESIGN
Theoretically, we expect the precoding matrix could achieve
the highest sum of data rates to increase the system throughput,
that is
(T 1,T 2) = arg max
(T 1,T 2)
2∑
i=1
Ri(T 1,T 2)
However, since the equation is not a convex function, finding
the optimum precoding matrices is inferred to be a NP-
hard problem [9]. Consequently, various design methods of
precoding matrix have been proposed to reduce the complexity
of the determination. Here we introduce conservative ZF
precoding scheme and JLS precoding scheme.
A. Zero Forcing
In our system model, the received signal of UEi is expressed
as
ri =HiiT ixi +
K∑
j=1,j 6=i
HijT jxj + ni (2)
Zero forcing beam forming is a standard approach to elimi-
nate interference, which makes the precoding matrix satisfy
HijT j = 0,∀i 6= j. Let
H˜ii =
[
HHi1, . . . ,H
H
i(i−1),H
H
i(i+1), . . . ,H
H
iB
]H
the zero forcing precoding matrix is given by
T i = GiW i and Gi = I − H˜†iiH˜ii
where the columns of W i are the L eigenvectors correspond-
ing to the L largest eigenvalues of HiiGi and H˜
†
ii denote the
pseudo-inverse matrix of H˜ii
B. Joint Leakage Suppression
JLS is an signal-to-leakage-plus-noise-ratio (SLNR) based
precoding technique, which is designed to maximize the SLNR
of each user. The SLNR for UEmkk can be expressed as
SLNRk(T k) =
Trace(THk H
H
kkHkkT k)
MRN0 + Trace(THk H
H
lkH lkT k)|l 6=k
(3)
Compared with the traditional design method which based on
the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) described in
equation (4)
SINRk(T 1,T 2) =
Trace(THk H
H
kkHkkT k)
MRN0 + Trace(THl H
H
klHklT l)|l 6=k
(4)
C. Eigenvalue Pairing Algorithm
The inefficiency of Sum Rate pairing with simplified pre-
coding causes us to find other methods to deal with the pairing
problem. Hence we make some approximations to the equation
(7) as follows:
The original sum-rate optimum problem is
(m1,m2) = arg max
m1,m2=1,...,M
(Rm11 +R
m2
2 )
From equation (8), the above optimum problem can be equiv-
alently turned into
(m1,m2) = arg max
m1,m2=1,...,M
max
T 1,T 2
(
log2|IMR +Φ−11 Hm111 T 1TH1 (Hm111 )H |
•|IMR +Φ−12 Hm222 T 2TH2 (Hm222 )H |)
(11)
As a monotonic increasing function, log function dose not
affect the solution of the optimum problem, i.e., maximizing
log(A) is equivalent to maximizing A. We remove the log
function to facilitate the calculation. Therefore, this equation
can be rewritten as
(m1,m2) = arg max
m1,m2=1,...,M
max
T 1,T 2
(
|IMR +Φ−11 Hm111 T 1TH1 (Hm111 )H |
• |IMR +Φ−12 Hm222 T 2TH2 (Hm222 )H |)
= arg max
m1,m2=1,...,M
max
T 1,T 2

(12)
Consider the precoding matrices are designed to suppressed
ICI and the interference term is negligible compared with
signal power. Accordingly, we ignore the interference power
term in the second and the forth determinants(13). Where
the first equality follows from the property of matrices that
det(αIm + AB) = αm−n det(αIn + BA). We can ap-
proximate its high SNR behavior and restrict the set of the
precoding matrices T k satisfy THk T k ≈ PL−1IL
