tion results show that the performance of the proposed
CE method can provides higher location estimation
accuracy throughout the sensor field comparing to the
conventional Newton method and the conjugate gradient
method.
三、 系統模型與問題定義
We focus on statistical location estimation using the
ML method which is applied to the RSS of IEEE
802.15.4 radio signals. Based on the experimental results
in [5], the pdf of the RSS against the distance, denoted
by r, for IEEE 802.15.4 radio signals in an indoor en-
vironment, can be approximated well by an exponential
distribution. Therefore, the conditional pdf p (P | r) of
the RSS P when r is given can be expressed by
p (P | r) = 1
P
exp
(
−P
P
)
, (1)
where P is the average RSS, expressed as
P = C × r−np , (2)
where np is the path-loss exponent that depends on the
propagation environment, and C is a constant determined
by wireless channel property, transmission power, and so
on.
After each anchor node measures the RSSs for a
desired target, all the information on the RSSs is sent
to a data collection center. Given {Pk} (k is the anchor
node index, k = 1, 2, · · · ,K) as the available RSS
measurement data in the center, the problem in hand now
is how to accurately estimate a target’s location (x, y)
based on these measurement data. We assume that the
radio propagation channel between a target node and an
anchor node is independent of those among the target
node and other anchor nodes. Accordingly, the joint pdf
of the RSS P1, P2, · · · , PK conditioned by the position
Θ = [x y] of target node is
p (P1, P2, · · · , PK | Θ) =
K∏
k=1
p (Pk | Θ) =
K∏
k=1
p (Pk | rk) ,
(3)
where rk represents the distance between the target node
and anchor node k. Further, if we take the logarithm of
(3), the log likelihood function of (3) is
L (Θ) = log
{
K∏
k=1
p (Pk | Θ)
}
=
K∑
k=1
log {p (Pk | Θ)} ,
(4)
In addition, to derive a ML solution from (4), we
differentiate (4) and equate them to zero as follows:{
∂L(Θ)
∂x =
∂
∂x
∑K
k=1 log {p (Pk | Θ)} = 0
∂L(Θ)
∂y =
∂
∂y
∑K
k=1 log {p (Pk | Θ)} = 0
(5)
It is obvious that (5) is a system of non-linear equations.
Instead of solving (5) directly, in the next section we
propose a novel implementation for ML function in (4)
based on the CE algorithm.
四、 研究方法
4.1 The CE Method
The CE method was first proposed by Rubinstein [6]
to solve rare event estimation problems and was soon
successfully applied to solving both combinatorial and
continuous optimization problems. The CE method is a
general algorithm for solving global optimization tasks
of the form
arg max
Θ∈θ
S (Θ) , (6)
that is, we wish to maximize the score function S (Θ)
over all Θ in set θ. Instead of maintaining a simple
solution candidate Θt in each time step for the conven-
tional optimization algorithms, the main idea of the CE
method is to maintain a distribution of possible solutions,
and adaptively update this distribution according to the
Kullback-Leibler distance, i.e., cross entropy, between
the associated density and the optimal importance sam-
pling density. By doing so, one constructs a random
sequence of solutions which converges (probabilistically)
to the optimal or, at least, a reasonable solution. In
short, the CE method involves the following two iterative
phases: 1) Generate random samples in according to
a specified sampling distribution generated from the
previous iteration. 2) Update the parameters on the basis
of the best scoring samples in order to produce better
scoring samples in the next iteration. For a concrete
understanding of the CE method, the reader is referred
to [6].
4.2 The CE Algorithm for ML Location Estimation
In the ML location estimation problem, we are in-
terested in maximizing the log-likelihood function, ex-
pressed in (4), over the set Θ of all potential θ such
that
arg max
Θ∈θ
L (Θ) = arg max
Θ∈θ
K∑
k=1
log p (Pk | Θ) . (7)
The CE method is an adaptive importance sampling
method that transforms the deterministic optimization
problem (7) into a family of stochastic sampling prob-
lems. Hence, the first step in using the CE method
is to randomize our original deterministic problem (7)
by including a set of sampling distribution over de-
terministic Θ. In this project, we take the sampling
distribution to be a Gaussian distribution N (a, b), where
a and b are the mean and variance, respectively. It is
important to emphasize that the sampling distribution can
be quite arbitrary and does not need to be related to the
function that is being optimized. The reason we adopt
the Gaussian distribution is that it gives formulas that
are easy to update.
At each iteration t of the algorithm, a collection of N
random samples
{{
θ
(t)
i (n)
}2
i=1
}N
n=1
is obtained from

anchor nodes. 
 
In our simulation, we randomly generate the x position 
and y position of the target node over [-2,2] (m) and compare 
the proposed method with the conventional methods with 
respect to the number of sensors. The sensor nodes that 
estimate a target location in this simulation are assumed to be 
those that receive the largest signal strength transmitted from 
the target node. Fig. 2 shows an example of location 
estimation result with 16 sensor nodes. Fig. 3 shows the root 
mean square error (RMSE) versus the number of sensor 
nodes for five algorithms with different sensor nodes. The 
location estimation is performed over 10,000 Monte Carlo 
trials. The maximum iteration number for the conventional 
NT method, the NTT method, the CG method, and the CGT 
method are 10,000, and these algorithms will be stopped 
when the iteration number exceeds 10,000. If the iteration 
number of above methods reaches the maximum iteration 
number, the algorithm is regarded as “divergence”. From Fig. 
3, we observe that 1) as expected, the RMSE decreases when 
the number of sensors increases; 2) a good initial guess 
definitely improves the performance of the conventional NT 
method and CG method, but it should be noted that the 
proposed CE method is independent of the initial guess; 3) 
the proposed CE method always outperform the other 
conventional methods, even though some of them use the 
true target location as their initial approximation to start their 
algorithm.   
Finally, since the five compared algorithms are iterative 
algorithms, convergence is an important issue that needs to 
be discussed. The divergence probabilities for the NT method, 
the NTT method, the CG method, and the CGT method are 
2.78%, 0.07%, 1.05%, and 1.01%, respectively. On the other 
hand, the proposed CE algorithm is stopped when the 
iteration number exceeds 100. We can see from Fig. 2 that 
the performance of the proposed CE algorithm always 
converges to the optimal or, at least, a reasonable solution.
