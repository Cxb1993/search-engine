technique integrated with micro-optical interferometer incorporating 
three-dimensional micromirrors and microgratings. The interferometry system 
comprises a fixed grating mirror, two rotatable reflection mirrors, and a movable 
grating mirror driven by an electrostatically actuated comb structure. The novel 
system presented in this study provides a wider modulation frequency, and hence a 
wider frequency response. Furthermore, the proposed micro-optical interferometer 
can be applied to a micro-optical bench to facilitate signal modulation and optical 
measurement applications.

attracted considerable interest [3]. Similarly, other projection display techniques using 
MEMS technology such as the Digital Light ProcessorTM (DLP) chip [4], real-time 
color micro display [5] and laser display technology using a three-color mixing device 
[6], have also been promising and are ready for commercialization. 
Through suitable arrangement of a number of channel waveguides, the use of 
integrated optics enables color and intensity modulation [7, 8]. A three-color-mixer 
device combining three colors of light (red, green and blue), is definitely a crucial 
component in any projection display system [9]. This study reports on a new 
three-color-mixer using MEMS technology. Micromachined optical components have 
several advantages over their conventional counterparts including higher accuracy, 
higher switching speed, lower power consumption, and the capacity to be 
mass-produced at low cost. They could be realized using mature microfabrication 
technology [10, 11]. More importantly, the compactness of the micromachined optical 
elements makes the development of a miniaturized optical system feasible. 
In this study, we also report a new projection display system comprising a 
three-color-mixing device, an optical lens, a GLV device and a microscanner. The 
3x1 planar waveguide using a SU-8 material involves simple and low-cost processing 
steps when compared to silica-based materials. The GLV device presented in this 
paper is designed for optical modulation. Analytical models for the gratings are 
developed using optical diffraction theory. The microscanner is driven 
electrostatically and can be used for scanning projection display applications. 
 
2. System architecture and three-color-mixing waveguides 
Figure 1 schematically illustrates the new projection display system with 
integrated optical three-color-mixing waveguides, a GLV device, an optical lens, and 
a microscanner. The 3x1 planar waveguide provides red, green and blue colored lights 
and the mixing of which forms the free color. The free color light emits from the 
out-port of the planar waveguide device and is then collimated using a ball lens (with 
a diameter of 300 µm). The projection display picture is created by groups of movable 
ribbons that make up a GLV for optical intensity modulation. Finally, the 
microscanner is used to project the light beam to a screen. The light sources used in 
the experiment include a He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, red), diode-pumped lasers (532 nm, 
green) and an argon-ion laser (488 nm, blue), which are coupled into the waveguides 
via three multi-mode fibers. 
This study used SU-8 negative photoresist as a core material of the 3x1 planar 
waveguides. This material has several excellent characteristics for optical applications, 
including high transmittance for light from the visible to the near-IR range (as shown 
acid (HF) is used to release the structures. Finally, the chip is dried using a 
supercritical CO2 process, or by heating the released chip after rinsing. 
The electrostatically-driven GLV shown in Fig. 6 can be moved perpendicularly 
to the plane of the substrate to change the phase relationship between light reflected 
off the grating lines and the substrate. The dimensions of each grating line are 2 µm 
wide and 220 µm long with a 2-µm gap. The GLV device is coated with a layer of 
gold in their reflective top layer. The movable gratings are attached to the substrate by 
flexure beams which provide a restoring mechanical force. The electrostatic gratings 
have 0.75 µm deep dimples in the upper electrode surfaces to prevent stiction of the 
gratings after the release etch process, and to prevent the upper electrodes from 
contacting and shorting to the lower electrodes during actuation. The electrostatic 
gratings were designed to modulate optical intensity by shifting power from the zero 
diffracted order to the ± 1st diffracted orders. Figure 6 shows a diffraction pattern for 
a grating with an active area of 380 µm x 240 µm and 2 µm line/space dimensions. 
The angular separation and the number of diffracted orders agree with optical 
diffraction theory to within 3 %. When voltage is applied, the grating is moved toward 
the substrate, thus changing the phase difference between the light reflected from the 
top of the grating and light reflected from the substrate visible between the grating 
lines. The vertically actuated, surface-micromachined polysilicon GLV have been 
designed for optical switching and modulation applications. The moving grating 
achieves an 18.1 dB contrast ratio between the maximum and minimum intensity of 
the first diffracted order with a driving voltage of only 3 V at modulation rates up to 
110 kHz [13], making it an excellent candidate for an optical switch or modulator.   
 
4. Surface-micromachined optical scanner 
Figure 7 shows an SEM image of an electrostatically-driven microscanner with a 
mirror scanning angle of up to ±15o, with a mirror diameter of 320 µm. The mirror is 
coated with a gold layer to serve as a reflecting surface. It is well known that a curved 
mirror surface tends to distort reflected light, causing scattering and insertion loss. 
The current device overcomes this limitation by introducing a layer of PSG between 
two polysilicon layers. The resulting three-layer sandwich stack structure has a total 
thickness of 4.25 µm, which ensures sufficient rigidity and therefore prevents the gold 
layer from physically curving. The sandwiched mirror structure has effectively 
improved the optical insertion loss and the flatness of the reflection area. The scanner 
is fabricated using the MUMPs process as described in Section 3. This study 
successfully demonstrated a surface-micromachined optical scanner using four 
stress-actuated polysilicon plates to raise a horizontal mirror. The optical scanner has
