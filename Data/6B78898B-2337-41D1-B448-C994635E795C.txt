ABSTRACT 
This first phase of the two-years project aims to 
investigate numerically the effect of thermal interaction 
on the cooling performance of heat source module in a 
cabinet.  Moreover, air vents are constructed on the 
cabinet walls, the thermal buoyancy force could induce 
air to flow through the cabinet.  Attention is also focused 
on the examination of chimney effect on heat transfer 
enhancement of heat generating blocks.  Results show 
that the thermal interaction and vents can significantly 
affect the cooling performance of block heat sources.  
The maximum difference in hot spot temperatures for the 
situations with and without consideration of thermal 
interaction can be up to 40% as Pr =0.7 and 103  Ra  ≦ ≦
106.  When three vents are constructed in the cabinet 
walls, the hot spot temperature can be reduced 45%.  On 
the other hand, the differences in the hot spot 
temperatures for cases with 3 and 2 air vents are within 
6%.

module, Heat transfer enhancement  
 
INTRODUCTION 
Heat transfer from block heat sources mounted on a 
board to natural convective fluid stream in an cabinet is 
widely encountered in engineering application, such as in 
the cooling of electronic systems and convection in 
building elements.  There are a lot of researchers have 
dealt with the natural convective characteristics for block 
heat sources in cabinets.  Most of those articles assigned 
the temperatures or heat fluxes on the cabinet walls.  
However, the thermal boundary conditions on the walls 
are not known a prior in many systems.  The wall 
temperatures or wall heat fluxes have to be found in the 
solution processes, which are affected by the thermal 
interaction between the natural convective flow inside the 
cabinet and the ambient through cabinet walls.  In 
addition, the heat flux in thermal devices has become 
more and vaster as a result of the increasing requirements 
of compactness for the respective systems.  Therefore, it 
is important to search for ways to effectively augment the 
characteristics of convective heat transfer from block heat 
sources. The main objective of this study is firstly to 
examine the effects of thermal interaction between the air 
flows inside and outside an cabinet on thermal 
characteristics of heat generating blocks mounted on a 
board in the cabinet. Furthermore, great effort is 
performed to investigate the enhancement of cooling 
performance of the blocks by constructing air vents on 
the cabinet walls.  
Because of its frequent occurrence in the industrial 
applications, convective heat transfer from discrete heat 
sources have been studied by numerous researchers in the 
past.  Due to the space limitation, only a brief review of 
the previous literature is presented below. Heindel et al. 
(1995a, 1995b) theoretically and experimentally 
investigated the natural convection in a rectangular cavity 
induced by 3 × 3 array of discrete, flush-mounted heat 
sources. They found that the Nusselt numbers predicted 
by the three-dimensional model are higher than those 
obtained from the two-dimensional model. However, the 
difference between two- and three-dimensional 
predictions is within 5% as the aspect ratio of heat source 
is greater than 3. Tou et al. (1999), and Tou and Zhang 
(2003) conducted the natural convection in the vertical

SOLUTION METHOD 
The governing equations (1) - (6) and boundary 
conditions (7) – (11) are solved by a numerical scheme 
derived from the SIMPLER algorithm. The finite 
difference equations for P, U, V and θ are obtained by 
integrating the respective continuity, X-momentum, Y-
momentum and energy equations over the control 
volumes via a power-law scheme. To obtain enhanced 
accuracy, no uniform grids are arranged in the 
computational domain. The grid density is higher in the 
vicinity of the board and block heat sources to capture the 
drastic variations of the flow and thermal fields. The line-
by-line method with iteration is employed to solve the 
systems of algebraic equations obtained from discretizing 
the pressure, momentum and energy equations.   
The solution is considered to be converged when the 
relative differences of U, V, and θ at each node between 
two consecutive iterations, as well as the overall energy 
imbalance of the system are less than a prescribed value 
of 10-4. 
The proposed numerical algorithm is validated in two 
ways.  First, different numbers of grid lines in both the  
X– and Y– direction are employed to ensure that the

in Fig. 2(d) show that the air drawn through the right vent 
divides into two substreams as it approaches the board.  
The flow rate of substream flowing over the back side of 
board is larger than that flowing over the front side.  A 
comparison on Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) reveals that the 
substream flowing over the front side of board increases 
with the movement of up vent toward the right. 
Figure 3(a) – 3(f) illustrate the influences of thermal 
interaction and air vents on the temperature distributions 
for the system with Ra =105 and Kbf = Kpf = Kwf =100.  
The variations of isotherms in Fig. 3(a) are rather 
different from that in Fig. 3(b) in the region near the 
cabinet wall.  In addition, the temperatures in Fig. 3(a) is 
evidently lower than those in Fig. 3(b).  Thus the thermal 
interaction of fluids inside and outside the cabinet can 
play important role for the heat dissipation  
of blocks.  The results in Fig. 3(c) show that the 
temperatures for the block, board , and in the region near 
the block and board are evidently smaller than those in 
Fig. 3(a) and 3(b).  Accordingly, the air vents can greatly 
enhance the cooling performance of the blocks. A 
scrutiny on the results in Fig. 3(d) – 3(f) reveals that the 
effect of air vent position on temperature distribution for 
the block and board are not significantly. 
Figure 4 represent the variation of local Nussel 
numbers along the bottom, front and top surfaces of the 
blocks for various types as Ra =106 and Kbf = Kpf = Kwf 
=100. An overall inspection reveals that, for a given 
block, the maximum heat transfer coefficient occurs at 
the bottom-front corner of block. The Nu’s for the front 
surfaces increase in the region near the right-top corners 
of blocks.  This can be attributed to the fact that the front 
substream is deflected toward the gaps among blocks as it 
passes over the blocks.  For each type, the Nu’s for the 
bottom and front surfaces of the up block are smaller than 
those of the low and mid blocks.  However, the up block 
has the highest Nu among the top surfaces of the block.  
This is due to the fact that the deflection of the front

substream toward top surface of the up block is rather 
strong.  It is seen that the Nu’s for type A and B are 
substantially different.  Consequently, the interaction 
between the fluids inside and outside the cabinet through 
the wall is important for the heat transfer performance of 
the heat generating blocks.  The Nu for the top surface of 
the up block is the largest for type C with three air vents 
constructed on the cabinet wall.  When the system with 
one inlet vent at right wall (type D), its Nu for the low 
block is the largest among the types.  A comparison on 
the Nu’s for type E and F reveals that a movement of the 
outlet vent toward right can cause an increase in the heat 
transfer coefficient.   
To conveniently investigate the effects of thermal 
interaction and air vents on the heat transfer 
characteristics, Tables 2-4 list the maximum temperatures 
of the blocks and the hot spot temperatures of the system  
for various types. Table 2 illustrates the maximum 
temperature of low, mid and up blocks for various types 
at Ra = 106 and Kbf = Kwf = Kpf = 100. It is reasonably 
seen that the θmax of up block is the highest among the

Figure 1 The schematic of the physical system 
 
board placed in a channel is rather limited. This study 
numerically conducts the effects of constructing slots and 
installing baffle on the characteristics of heat transfer from 
block heat sources to air stream in a two-dimensional channel. 
In addition, because the board under investigation is short, 
attention is also paid to examine the influences of the leading 
and trailing edges of the board on the velocity and temperature 
fields. 
ANALYSIS 
The physical system under consideration, as illustrated in 
Figure 1, is a two-dimensional plate channel containing a 
board which is installed with the leading edge le downstream 
from the channel inlet, and with c2 above the bottom channel 
plate. Five block heat sources with height hb and length lb are 
mounted on the up side of the board. The front, top and rear 
surfaces of the block heat sources are subjected to a uniform 
heat flux. A coolant stream enters the channel with uniform 
velocity ue and temperature Te. The stream divides into two 
substreams as it approaches the leading edge of the board. The 
up substream flows through the up side of the board and 
removes the heat dissipated from the blocks. It is known that 
the heat transfer characteristics for the front and rear surfaces 
of the block heat sources are poor, owing to the appearance of 
recirculation cells in the gaps among blocks and behind the 
last block. Aiming to enhance the heat transfer characteristics 
of the block heat sources, this study proposes the methods of 
constructing slots in the board and installing a baffle onto the 
channel wall. Five slots are constructed among the block heat 
sources and behind the last block. Each one of the forward 
four slots is allocated at da behind block heat source, and the 
last slot is at df behind the last (fifth) block heat source. A 
baffle with length lp and height hp is mounted on either the up 
or bottom channel wall at positron near the trailing edge of the 
board. It is expected that only if a small portion of the stream 
passes across the slots, either upward or downward, the 
structures of recirculation cells will be changed. Meanwhile a 
baffle on the channel wall would cause the flow to deflect 
toward the board and could strengthen the movement of fluids 
passing cross the slots. Thus the heat transfer performance of 
the block heat sources might be effectively enhanced if the 
slots and baffle are well set up. 
Owing to the vast parameters governing this problem, the heat 
conductivities of the board and baffle are assumed to be very 
small so that the heat conduction through the board and baffle 
can be ignored. Thus the attention of present study can be 
more concentrated on the effects of slots and baffle on the 
transfer characteristics of block heat sources. The basic 
equations in dimensionless form describing the steady laminar 
forced convection in a two-dimensional plate channel are as 
follows.

Equations (5) - (9) refer to the usual no-slip conditions on all 
the solid walls, and the assumption of thermal insulation for 
channel plates, board and baffle. The stream has uniform 
velocity and uniform temperature at the channel inlet, and 
hydrodynamic and thermal fully developed conditions at 
locations far downstream of the trailing edge of the board. 
With n representing the outward normal direction, equation (8) 
imposes a uniform heat flux along the block surfaces exposed 
to the stream, while equation (9) describes the thermal 
insulation for surfaces of the board and baffle. 
The local Nusselt number along the front, top and rear 
surfaces of each block heat sources is of interest to the thermal 
system designer.  It is defined as

Figure 3  The effects of slot and baffle on the distributions of 
streamlines for C2 = 0.4, Re = 500 and (a) type I ; (b) type 
II ;(c) type III with Dp=4.95 ;(d) type IV with Dp=5.45 
 
streamlines of up substream deflect apparently downward in 
the region around the last block, a large recirculation cell 
appears behind the baffle. Also noted in this figure is that the 
direction of fluids passing across the fourth slot is downward, 
which is different from that depicted in Figure 2(b) for the 
situation without the installation of baffle. The results in 
Figure 2(d) illustrate that a baffle on the bottom channel wall 
could cause the phenomena of fluid passing across the slots to 
be more evident than those for the baffle on the up channel 
wall. An overall inspection on Figures 2(a) – 2(c) reveals that 
the construction of slots in the board and the installation of 
baffle on the channel wall can strongly affect the flow 
distributions around the blocks.  
Figures 3(a) – 3(c) plot the streamlines for the cases with the 
board placed at C2 = 0.4. For the limiting case without the 
appearance of slot and baffle, it is seen in Figure 3(a) that the 
streamlines at the positions about Y = C2 evidently distort 
downward in the region near the leading edge of board. The 
results illustrate that there are fluids flowing from the area of 
Y > C2 downward to the area of Y < C2. In the region near the 
trailing edge of board, the streamlines of the low substream 
are rather parallel to the channel plates. These phenomena are 
substantially different to those for the cases with C2 = 0.2. The 
results in Figure 3(b) show that the distortions of streamlines 
in the area of Y > C2 are weakened in the channel entrance 
region owing to the appearance of slots in the board. In 
addition a portion of fluids of the substream over the board 
(up substream) flow downward into the gaps, and circulate 
along the front surfaces of blocks. It is noted in Figure 3(b) 
that the direction of fluids passing across the slot behind the 
last block is upward, which is different from those passing 
across the slots in the gaps. When a baffle is installed onto the 
up channel wall at position behind the fourth block, it is 
observed in Figure 3(c) that the movement of fluid passing 
across the fourth slot become further drastic and consequently 
the change of flow structure in the fourth gap is rather 
significant. A comparison on Figures 3(c) and 3(d) reveals that 
the movement of baffle from the up channel wall to the 
bottom channel wall causes drastic change in the flow 
structure.

Figure 4  The effects of slot and baffle on the distributions of 
isotherms for Re = 500, C2 = 0.2 and (a) type I ; (b) type II ;(c) 
type III with Dp=6.05 ;(d) type IV with Dp=5.65 
 
the temperature distributions for the system with the board 
placed at C2 = 0.2. For the limiting case without the 
appearance of slot and baffle, the isotherms plotted in Figure 
4(a) indicate that the thermal layers along the top and front 
surfaces of blocks are thicker for latter blocks. However, the 
smallest of the thermal layers along the rear surfaces of blocks 
is for the last block. This is due to the fact that there are fluids 
flowing from the area of Y < C2 upward to the area of Y > C2  
in the region near the trailing edge of board, and a portion of 
the fluids adversely circulate toward the rear surface of last 
block before turning to flow downstream. Consequently, the 
heat is more easily dissipated from the rear surface of the last 
block. In addition, the isotherms in the regions near the rear 
surfaces of blocks look like parallel. A comparison on the 
isotherms plotted in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) reveals that the 
thermal layers along the rear surfaces of the forward four 
blocks are thinner for the case with slots in the board. This can 
be attributed to the fact that, for the case with the appearance 
of slots, the fluids can pass across the slots from the area of Y 
< C2 upward into the gaps. The fluids circulate toward the rear 
surfaces of blocks before they leave the gaps, which can 
effectively enhance the heat transfer from the rear surfaces of 
blocks. In addition it is seen in Figure 4(b) that the isotherms 
in the vicinity of the rear surface of the last block become 
rather skew owing to the appearance of a counterclockwise 
recirculation cell in this region. It is observed in Figure 4(c) 
that, with the installation of a baffle onto the up channel wall 
at the position behind the fifth block, the temperatures are 
significantly reduced in the region around the fifth block. A 
scrutiny on the results in Figures 4(c) and 4(d) indicates that a 
movement of baffle from the up channel wall to the bottom 
channel wall could apparently drop the temperatures around 
the blocks. Shown in Figures 5(a) – 5(d) are the temperature 
distributions for the cases with the board placed at C2 = 0.4. 
An examination on the results in Figures 4(a) and 5(a) 
indicates that the differences in temperature distributions 
between C2 = 0.2 and C2 = 0.4 are not substantial in the 
vicinity of the blocks. This implies that, for the system 
without the appearance of slot and baffle, the heat transfer 
characteristics for the blocks are not sensitive to the variation 
of board location. The values of isotherms in Figures 5(b) -

blocks and behind the last block are altered, and the heat 
transfer characteristics of the block heat sources are  
significantly improved. The method of combined construting 
slots in the board and installing a baffle onto the channel wall 
can further promote the thermal performance of the system. 
The maximum enhancements of the average Nusselt numbers 
are about 192% and 66% for the front and rear surfaces of 
blocks, respectively, when Pr = 0.7, Le = 0.5, La = Lf = 1, Hb = 
Lb = 0.3, Db = 0.7, Ds = 0.4, Df = 0.1, Lp = 0.1, 0.2 ≤ C2 ≤ 0.4, 
0 ≤ Ls ≤ 0.2, 0 ≤ Hp ≤ 0.15, 4 ≤ Dp ≤ 7 and 100 ≤ Re ≤ 500. 
The maximum reduction in the temperature of hot spot is 
about 42%. In addition, for the situation without the 
appearance of slot and baffle, the streamlines strongly defect 
in the region near the trailing edge of board. The phenomena 
are different to the results of previous studies with long boards, 
and may cause the Nu for the rear surface of last block being  
higher than that of forward blocks.
