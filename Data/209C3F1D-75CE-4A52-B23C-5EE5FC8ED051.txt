results and also provided some mild conditions to improve Soyster’s results. The interval-valued
optimization problem proposed is closely related with the inexact linear programming problem. The
main difference between those two problems are the solutions concepts imposed upon the objective
functions. The solution concept in the inexact linear programming problem used the conventional
solution concept in the scalar linear programming problems. The solution concept of interval-valued
optimization problems proposed in this project follows from the similar solution concept of multiob-
jective programming problems. Moreover, the interval-valued objective function and interval-valued
constraint functions taken by the interval-valued optimization problem are considered as nonlinear-
type rather than linear-type considered by the inexact linear programming problem.
As we have known, the usual ordering “≤” is a total ordering on R; that is, for any two real
numbers in R, we can determine their order without difficulty. However, for any two closed intervals
in R, there is not a natural ordering among the class of all closed intervals in R. For example, for any
two closed intervals [1, 8] and [3, 9], we have to define an ordering to determine their order. In this
project, we provide two solution concepts for the interval-valued optimization problem (nonlinear
programming problem with interval-valued coefficients). Let [a, b] and [c, d] be two closed intervals
in R. A straightforward ordering between [a, b] and [c, d] is defined as [a, b]  [c, d] if and only if a ≤ c
and b ≤ d. Another ordering between [a, b] and [c, d] follows from Ishibuchi and Tanaka [10]. We shall
see that these two orderings are not total orderings on the class of all closed intervals. That is to say,
any two closed intervals are not always comparable under these two orderings (as we have known,
any two real numbers in R are comparable under the usual ordering “≤”). Since these two orderings
are not total orderings, these two solution concepts will follow from the similar solution concept
(Pareto optimal solution) in the multiobjective optimization problems. Under these settings, we are
going to derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for the interval-valued optimization
problem. We shall show that these two solution concepts are equivalent under the KKT optimality
conditions.
3 Research Methodology
Let A = [aL, aU ] and B = [bL, bU ] be two closed intervals in R. We write
A LU B if and only if aL ≤ bL and aU ≤ bU . (1)
It means that A is inferior to B, or B is superior to A. It is easy to see that “LU” is a partial
ordering on I (the class of all closed intervals in R).
Now we consider the following multiobjetove programming problem with multiple interval-valued
objective functions
(IVMOP1) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ∈ X ⊆ Rn,
where each
fk(x) = fk(x1, · · · , xn) =
[
fLk (x1, · · · , xn), fUk (x1, · · · , xn)
]
=
[
fLk (x), f
U
k (x)
]
is an interval-valued function for k = 1, · · · , r, and the feasible set X is assumed as a convex subset
of Rn. For instance, the kth objective function fk(x) can be taken as the linear-type objective
function fk(x) = Ak1x1 + Ak2x2 + · · ·+ Aknxn, where each Aki = [aLki, aUki] is a closed interval in R
for i = 1, · · · , n and k = 1, · · · , r.
Since each of objective values fk(x) is a closed interval, we need to provide an ordering relation
between any two closed intervals. The most direct way is to invoke the ordering relation “LU” that
was defined in (1). However “LU” is a partial ordering, not a total ordering, on I, we may follow
the similar concept of nondominated solution used in multiobjective programming problem.

Definition 3.2 Let x∗ be a feasible solution, i.e., x∗ ∈ X.
(i) We say that x∗ is a type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there exists no
x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯) ≺ f(x∗).
(ii) We say that x∗ is a strongly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there
exists no x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯)  f(x∗).
(iii) We say that x∗ is a weakly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there
exists no x¯ ∈ X such that fk(x¯) ≺ fk(x∗) for all k = 1, · · · , r.
Remark 3.2 Let X(II)wp , X
(II)
p and X
(II)
sp denote the set of all weakly type-II Pareto optimal solu-
tions, type-II Pareto optimal solutions and strongly type-II Pareto optimal solutions, respectively. It
is not hard to see that X(II)sp ⊆ X(II)p ⊆ X(II)wp . From Proposition 3.1, we also see that X(I)wp ⊆ X(II)wp ,
X
(I)
p ⊆ X(II)p and X(I)sp ⊆ X(II)sp .
In order to make the discussions more convenient, we define another ordering relation on I. Let
A = [aL, aU ] = 〈aC , aW 〉 and B = [bL, bU ] = 〈bC , bW 〉 be two closed intervals in R. Then we write
A UC B if and only if aU ≤ bU and aC ≤ bC .
We also write A ≺UC B if and only if A UC B and A 6= B. Ishibuchi and Tanaka [10] proved that
(i) A UC B if and only if A LU B or A CW B;
(ii) A ≺UC B if and only if A ≺LU B or A ≺CW B.
Let A = (A1, · · · , Ar) and B = (B1, · · · , Br) be two interval-valued vectors. We write A UC B if
and only if Ak UC Bk for each k = 1, · · · , r, and A ≺UC B if and only if Ak UC Bk for each
k = 1, · · · , r and Ah ≺UC Bh for at least one index h. Therefore, Definition 3.2 can be re-stated as
follows.
Definition 3.3 Let x∗ be a feasible solution, i.e., x∗ ∈ X.
(i) We say that x∗ is a type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there exists no
x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯) ≺UC f(x∗).
(ii) We say that x∗ is a strongly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there
exists no x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯) UC f(x∗).
(iii) We say that x∗ is a weakly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (IVMOP1) if there
exists no x¯ ∈ X such that fk(x¯) ≺UC fk(x∗) for all k = 1, · · · , r.
Let {Kj}nj=1 and K be n + 1 nonempty convex subsets of Rm and consider the following set
X = {x = (x1, · · · , xn) ∈ Rn : x1K1 + · · ·+ xnKn ⊆ K} .
Soyster [19] has shown that X is also a convex subset of Rn. Let b ∈ Rm and
K(b) = {k ∈ Rm : k ≤ b} ,
where k ≤ b means that ki ≤ bi for all i = 1, · · · ,m. Then K(b) is also a convex subset of Rm and
we consider the following set
X(b) = {x = (x1, · · · , xn) ∈ Rn : x1K1 + · · ·+ xnKn ⊆ K(b)} . (3)
The support functional sK : Rm → R of a convex set K is defined by, for y ∈ Rm,
sK(y) = sup
k∈K
yTk,
where yT means the transpose of y. Let {Kj}nj=1 be n nonempty convex subsets of Rm and consider
the column vector a¯j with the ith component defined by a¯ij = sKj (ei), where ei is the unit vector
(0, · · · , 0, 1, 0, · · · 0) with 1 in the ith position. Then we see that
a¯ij = sKj (ei) = sup
kj∈Kj
eTi kj = sup
kj∈Kj
kij ,
4
for all possible kij ∈ [kLij , kUij ], i = 1, · · · ,m and j = 1, · · · , n. Let
K(b) =
{
k = (k1, · · · , km) : ki ∈ [bLi , bUi ], i = 1, · · · ,m
}
.
and, for j = 1, · · · , n,
Kj =
{
kj = (k1j , · · · , kij , · · · , kmj) : kij ∈ [kLij , kUij ], i = 1, · · · ,m
}
.
Then it is easy to see that {Kj}nj=1 and K(b) are compact and convex subsets of Rm. Now let AL
and AU be two m×n matrices comprise the column vectors aLj and aUj for j = 1, · · · , n, respectively,
where aLj and a
U
j are given by
aLij = inf
kj∈Kj
eTi kj = inf
kj∈Kj
kij = kLij and a
U
ij = sup
kj∈Kj
eTi kj = sup
kj∈Kj
kij = kUij . (6)
We adopt the notations bL = (bL1 , · · · , bLm) and bU = (bL1 , · · · , bUm), and also consider the augmented
matrix Aˆ = [AU ,−AL] and vector bˆ = [bU ,−bL]. Then we consider an auxiliary interval-valued
multiobjective minimization problem of (SIVMOP1) as follows.
(IVMOP4) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to Aˆx ≤ bˆ and x ≥ 0.
Remark 3.4 It is easy to see that the feasible set of problem (IVMOP4) can be rewritten as{
x : AUx ≤ bU ,−ALx ≤ −bL and x ≥ 0} = {x : AUx ≤ bU , ALx ≥ bL and x ≥ 0} .
Next we are going to show that the feasible sets of problems (SIVMOP1) and (IVMOP4) are
identical with each other.
Proposition 3.3 Let X1 and X2 be the feasible sets of problems (SIVMOP1) and (IVMOP4), re-
spectively. Then X1 = X2.
From the above proposition, we also have the following useful result.
Proposition 3.4 Suppose that the problems (SIVMOP1) and (IVMOP4) use the same solution con-
cepts, e.g., the type-I and type-II Pareto optimal solution concepts proposed in the previous section.
Then (SIVMOP1) and (IVMOP4) have the same (Pareto optimal) solutions.
Let us say that the constraints discussed in the above problems are linear-type constraints with
interval-valued coefficients. Next we are going to discuss the nonlinear-type constraints with interval-
valued coefficients. Suppose that we consider the following simple problem
(SIVMOP2) min f(x1, x2, x3) = (f1(x1, x2, x3), · · · , fr(x1, x2, x3))
subject to x21[k

x1, x2, x3 ≥ 0,
where fk(x1, x2, x3) =
[
fLk (x1, x2, x3), f
U
k (x1, x2, x3)
]
for k = 1, · · · , r. Let k1 = (k11, k12, k13) be
fixed for some k11 ∈ [kL11, kU11], k12 ∈ [kL12, kU12] and k13 ∈ [kL13, kU13]. For the first constraint, we can
form a constraint function
gk1(x1, x2, x3) = k11 · x21 + k12 · x1x2 + k13 · x32x23. (7)

Next, we consider two more problems by using the ordering relations “LU” and “UC” for the
constraints. The first problem is formulated as follows.
(LU-SIVMOP) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to gi(x) LU [bLi , bUi ], i = 1, · · · ,m
x ≥ 0,
where gi(x) = [gLi (x), g
U
i (x)] are interval-valued constraints functions for i = 1, · · · ,m. Then x =
(x1, · · · , xn) is a feasible solution of problem (LU-SIVMOP) if gi(x) LU [bLi , bUi ] for all i = 1, · · · ,m;
or, equivalently, gLi (x) = gkLi (x) ≤ bLi and gUi (x) = gkUi (x) ≤ bUi for all i = 1, · · · ,m. Then the
auxiliary interval-valued optimization problem of (LU-SIMVOP) can be taken as follows.
(IVMOP6) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to gLi (x) = gkLi (x) ≤ b
L
i , i = 1, · · · ,m
gUi (x) = gkUi (x) ≤ b
U
i , i = 1, · · · ,m
x ≥ 0.
It is obvious that the feasible sets of problems (LU-SIVMOP) and (IVMOP6) are identical with
each other.
The second problem is formulated as follows.
(UC-SIVMOP) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to gi(x) UC [bLi , bUi ], i = 1, · · · ,m
x ≥ 0,
where gi(x) = [gLi (x), g
U
i (x)] are interval-valued constraints functions for i = 1, · · · ,m. Then x =
(x1, · · · , xn) is a feasible solution of problem (UC-SIVMOP) if gi(x) UC [bLi , bUi ] for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
i.e., gLi (x) ≤ bLi and gCi (x) ≤ bCi for all i = 1, · · · ,m; or, equivalently, gLi (x) ≤ bLi and gLi (x)+gUi (x) ≤
bLi + b
U
i for all i = 1, · · · ,m. Then the auxiliary interval-valued optimization problem of (UC-
SIVMOP) can be taken as follows.
(IVMOP7) min f(x) = (f1(x), · · · , fr(x))
subject to gLi (x) ≤ bLi , i = 1, · · · ,m
gLi (x) + g
U
i (x) ≤ bLi + bUi , i = 1, · · · ,m
x ≥ 0.
It is obvious that the feasible sets of problems (UC-SIVMOP) and (IVMOP7) are identical with
each other. Then the following proposition is also obvious.
Proposition 3.6 (i) Suppose that the problems (LU-SIVMOP) and (IVMOP6) use the same solu-
tion concepts, e.g., the type-I and type-II solution concepts proposed in the previous section. Then
(LU-SIVMOP) and (IVMOP6) have the same (optimal) solutions.
(ii) Suppose that the problems (UC-SIVMOP) and (IVMOP7) use the same solution concepts,
e.g., the type-I and type-II solution concepts proposed in the previous section. Then (UC-SIVMOP)
and (IVMOP7) have the same (optimal) solutions.
In the sequel, we are going to discuss the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for the
above interval-valued multiobjective programming problems (IVMOP2), (SIVMOP1), (SIVMOP3),
(LU-SIVMOP) and (UC-SIVMOP).

(iii) µU1i · (gUi (x∗) − bUi ) = µL1i · (bLi − gLi (x∗)) = ν1jx∗j = 0 and µU2i · (gUi (x∗) − bUi ) = µL2i ·
(bLi − gLi (x∗)) = ν2jx∗j = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m and j = 1, · · · , n, where ν1 = (ν11, · · · , ν1n)T and
ν2 = (ν21, · · · , ν2n)T ,
then x∗ is a weakly type-I and type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (SIVMOP3).
Theorem 4.4 Let X be a feasible set of problem (SIVMOP3) and a point x∗ ∈ X. Assume that
the interval-valued constraint functions gi : Rn → I, i = 1, · · · ,m, are LU-concave-convex and
weakly continuously differentiable at x∗, and the interval-valued objective functions fk : Rn → I are
weakly continuously differentiable at x∗ for k = 1, · · · , r. Suppose that some of the interval-valued
objective functions are lower-convex (resp. upper-convex) and the remaining interval-valued objective
functions are strictly lower-pseudoconvex (resp. strictly upper-pseudoconvex) at x∗. If there exist
(Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λLk (resp. 0 < λ

j = 1, · · · , n, where ν = (ν1, · · · , νn)T ,
then x∗ is a strongly type-I and type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (SIVMOP3).
Now we consider problem (LU-SIVMOP). Let f(x) = [fL(x), fU (x)] be an interval-valued func-
tion defined on Rn and be H-differentiable at x0 ∈ Rn. The gradient of f at x0, denoted by ∇f(x0),
is defined by
∇f(x0) =
(
∂f
∂x1
(x0), · · · , ∂f
∂xn
(x0)

,
where (∂f/∂xj)(x0) is the jth partial H-derivative of f at x0 by referring Definition ??. Furthermore,
the partial H-derivative
∂f
∂xj
(x0) =
[
∂fL
∂xj
(x0),
∂fU

is a closed interval. Any real number ν can also be regarded as a closed interval [ν, ν]. Let gi be
interval-valued functions defined on Rn for i = 1, · · · ,m. Then the following equation

where 0 < λk ∈ R, k = 1, · · · , r, and 0 ≤ µi, νj ∈ R, i = 1, · · · ,m and j = 1, · · · , n, can be interpreted
