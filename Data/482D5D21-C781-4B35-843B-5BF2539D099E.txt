中文摘要 
為了減少儲存資訊量和網路傳輸的負載，影像壓縮技術已經被廣泛的應用在多媒體通訊上。然而
在壓縮的過程中，重建影像容易在邊緣附近生震盪式的雜訊，也就是俗稱的環效應。許多去除環效應
所提出的演算法都沒有考慮到更小的區域性去環效應問題段把影像大量使用掃描線都儲存起來作為後
處理使用，而且在去除環效應時都沒有保留影像的細節跟紋理。針對這個現象，我們提出一個改善的
演算法，在儲存影像較少量掃描線的情形下進行環效應的偵測以保留影像細節及紋理，更進一步在邊
緣區域使用濾波器以及邊緣資訊保留紋理區域。實驗結果不管在主觀的視覺品質或是客觀的 PSNR 數
據上都有非常好的表現。 
CCSDS 標準是目前處理衛星影像壓縮最普遍的方法，然而其演算法僅僅提供以壓縮倍率為選項的
功能，與目前就普及的壓縮方法相較，其功能性過為薄弱。於此我們在不更動 CCSDS 標準的演算法核
心架構的前提下，提供了以帶狀為基底(Strip-based)或是全幅為基底(Frame-based)的 ROI 功能性，可以
在不更動現有的 CCSDS 硬體規格前提下，直接以硬體實作附加於 CCSDS 系統之上；此外，以帶狀為
基底(Strip-based)的ROI更是可以大量減少硬體的Buffer花費，使得整個硬體系統的成本可以大為降低。
而由最後的實驗結果我們可以發現，在壓縮品質的表現上也是有不錯的效能。

Content 
There are two parts of results in this project. One is an efficient method for the detection of ringing 
artifacts and de-ringing in jpeg image; the other is the realization of multiple region-of-interests in CCSDS. 
The former has been published in the 28th Picture Coding Symposium, and the full paper is shown in the 
appendix. Most concepts and simulation results of the latter is presented here and will be published in some 
international journal in the future. 
Introduction  
Satellite images have been widely used in many fields such as military affairs, atmospheric sciences, 
topography recognition, environmental studies, ocean-temperature detection, and so on. An obvious 
characteristic of satellite images is their large data size. However, users are usually more interested in some 
regions rather than the full frame of a satellite image. To satisfy this request, region-of-interests coding 
adopted in image compression is the most popular method. In fact, besides the researches focused on high 
compression qualities [1], [2], [3], [4], there had been more and more issues concerning about the ROI 
capability [5], [6], [7].  
JPEG2000 standard is one of the popular image compression methods that provides the ROI capability 
and is very powerful. In the part I of JPEG2000 standard [8], the ROI encoding is implemented with a scaling 
coefficient method called MAXSHIFT. A binary mask with a hierarchical structure is generated for focusing 
original discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and then these specified ROI coefficients are shifted upwards over 
the most significant bit (MSB) of bit planes of other background coefficients. After shifting ROI wavelet 
coefficients, Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation (EBCOT) is applied to encode the bit planes 
of all coefficients from MSB to LSB, and thus the specified ROI coefficients will be encoded first to ensure 
their better quality of the reconstructed image. Note that MAXSHIFT needs extra memory space to store the 
binary mask and moreover, EBCOT is a complex process. 
The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is an organization that meets periodically 
to address data system problems that are common to all participants, including image data compression 
system [9], [10], [11] and others. Because of the limitation of the hardware used aboard spacecraft, the 
compression technique described in the recommended standard proposed by CCSDS, that will be denoted as 
the CCSDS standard hereafter, differs from the JPEG2000 standard in several respects: 
a) it specially targets use aboard spacecraft; 
b) a careful trade-off has been performed between compression performance and complexity; 
c) being less complex, it can be fully implemented in either hardware or software; 
d) it has limited set of options, supporting its successful application without in-depth algorithm 
knowledge. 
Because of these characteristics, the CCSDS standard is the most popularly adapted to be implemented in 
 6 
coefficients is also generated in this step as shown in Fig. 2. Then we will scale the wavelet coefficients by 
shifting upwards the bit planes of the ROI coefficients to ensure that the quality of ROIs in the reconstructed 
image is the best.  
 
Figure 1. Example of a PROI mask generation from an ROI mask. (a) Relation of a PROI mask to an ROI mask. (b) Example of 
ROI and PROI masks. 
In the general scaling-based method of JPEG2000, the wavelet coefficients will multiply a suitable 
scaling factor k. That is, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the bit planes of the wavelet coefficients of ROIs will be 
shifted upwards by ⌈log2k⌉ bits, where ⌈log2k⌉ means the smallest integer that is bigger than ⌈log2k⌉. Next 
the MQ-encoder is adopted to perform entropy coding for the scaled wavelet coefficients. However, some 
wavelet coefficients of ROIs and those of the background are coded in the same bit plane. In order to 
distinguish them, the encoder has to transmit extra information such as the shape or the mask of ROIs. Thus 
an extra bit stream containing the information of ROIs is needed and moreover, this will cause more 
computational complexity while recovering the scaled wavelet coefficients in the decoder.

ReGrouping, is performed where the transformed coefficients are rearranged in 8 ×  8 blocks. A group of S 
consecutive blocks are defined as a segment. S can be assigned to any positive integer in the range 16 ≤
 S ≤  220, depending on the available buffer to store the segment. Finally, each segment is independently 
encoded by the BPE. Every 16 consecutive blocks within a segment are grouped to form a gaggle, as shown in 
Figure 5, which is the least unit for entropy coding in the BPE. 
As aforementioned, transformed coefficients of the original image would be reorganized in several 8 × 8 
blocks before being processed by the BPE. A block, as shown in Fig. 5, consisting of 64 coefficients 
represents an 8 × 8 region of an original image, and contains coefficients from all the subbands generated by 
DWT. The top-left coefficient, DC, is a single coefficient taken from the most top-left subband (LL). The rest 
of the coefficients, AC components, are taken from other subbands with the hierarchical structure given by the 
DWT. Due to the different characteristics of DC and AC components, they will be encoded with different 
techniques.  
The BPE is designed to process 8 × 8 blocks. Every 16 consecutive blocks constitute a gaggle and all 
the blocks in a gaggle are entropy encoded together. Once all the blocks in a segment are processed, the 
streams obtained for each block in the segment are interleaved in order to produce an encoded segment. 
Within a segment, the BPE processes each coefficient with a bit plane structure. The following is a brief 
process of the BPE. 
1. DC coefficients are quantized, and a Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) considering all 
blocks in the segment is applied, followed by Golomb-Rice Coding considering all blocks in a gaggle. 
2. The remaining DC bit planes not quantized that are greater than the bit-depth of AC, if any are refined. 
3. The bit depth of AC coefficients from each block is encoded using the same technique as for the 
quantized DC coefficients. 
4. From the AC bit depth to the lowest bit plane, DC remaining bit planes are refined, and AC significance 
and refinement are encoded. 
5. Stream from each block in the segment are interleaved to construct a quality progressive file. 
 
Figure 6. LL3 subband is included in the ROI mask.

Step 3. Indicate whether the wavelet coefficients are larger than k or not. If they are, divide them by k. 
Step 4. Perform the 3-level inverse DWT and output the reconstructed image. 
Note that MAXSHIFT for ROI could just be realized in the frame-based mode. For example, if the 
current strip does not contain any ROI information, the shifting scheme will not be performed while 
processing this strip. In this way the quality of this strip is better than that of non-ROI of other strips 
containing ROI information and even might be as good as that of the ROI of other strips. Thus in the final 
reconstructed image, the quality of the ROI could not be ensured to be the best. This contradicts the purpose 
of the ROI scalability.

B. Multiple ROI coding in the CCSDS standard 
Here a compression algorithm for realizing the multiple ROI coding in the strip-based CCSDS standard 
is presented. In the regrouping process in the CCSDS standard, we find that the texture of the rearranged 
wavelet coefficients is similar to that of the original image. As shown in Fig. 7, in either image, the texture in 
A is more complicated while that in B is smoother. By this observation, for the range of each ROI where the 
left-top point (𝑥𝑙𝑡, 𝑦𝑙𝑡) and the right-bottom point (𝑥𝑟𝑏, 𝑦𝑟𝑏) are assigned by users, we re-calculate the 
relative positions (𝑥′𝑙𝑡 , 𝑦
′
𝑙𝑡
) and (𝑥′𝑟𝑏, 𝑦
′
𝑟𝑏
) in the regrouped coefficients by the following equations. Fig. 
8 is an example of the modification of the range of an ROI.

impossible. In this case we need to preserve the bits, Bnon− ROI , that are necessary while decoding the 
non-ROIs, and then the rest bits, Btotal − Bnon− ROI , are all distributed to the ROIs. On the contrary, if the 
former is greater than the latter, we allocate bits to the ROIs prior to the non-ROIs. The details of bit 
allocation are shown in the Algorithm 1. 
Simulation results

Figure 11. Test images captured with different frequencies in set II. 
There are two test image sets obtained from Nation Space Organization (NSPO) in this experiment. 
There are four 8-bit satellite images captured with rays at different spectra in each image set. The dimension 
of these satellite images in set I, as shown in Fig. 10, is 3000×10440, and that of the images in set II, as shown 
in Fig. 11, is 3000×7800. Note that the last images in both sets are more complicated than others. For example, 
as we can see in Fig. 10, there are more textures in B4 than in other three images. It means that the 
information contained in B4 is more useful and more important. Besides, for satellite image compression, a 
good trade-off between the compression quality and the compression rate is very important, too. In general 
cases, the assigned compression rate is usually in the range from 7.5 to 15. Therefore in our experiment, the 
PSNR performance in the range of compression rate from 6.67 to 20 is presented.

method and JPEG2000. Note that since the ROI is usually the most important region, in our experiment, only 
the PSNR of the ROI is concerned. The following equation is adopted to calculate the PSNR of n ROIs in an 
test image, where Q is the maximum possible value of the samples (here Q is set as 255 since the bitdepth of 
the test images is 8), 𝑢(𝑖, 𝑗) is the distortion between the original pixel value and the reconstructed pixel value, 
and 𝑊𝑘 and 𝐻𝑘 represent the width and the height of the kth ROI in an test image.

It is obvious that the PSNR of MAXSHIFT in the CCSDS standard is the worst of these results. In this 
case taking the whole LL subband as a part of the ROI increases the cost of entropy coding and thus greatly 
 16 
in Fig 13. This phenomenon is caused by the increasing of the segments. When the strip-based ROI coding is 
performed restricted to the buffer size, an image has to been partitioned into several non-overlapped strips. In 
this case, more headers are needed and thus the compression performance is affected. However, once the 
strip-based ROI coding could be performed, the design of the buffer size becomes more flexible and the cost 
of the hardware could be greatly decreased.

Conclusion 
Image compression with the ROI scalability is becoming popular. For satellite image compression that 
deals with the huge amount of data captured by sensors, the image compression standard proposed by CCSDS 
provides an excellent tradeoff between performance and complexity for medium and high target bit rates. 
However, the compression rate is the only one factor concerned in the original CCSDS standard. JPEG2000 is 
a popular and powerful image compression method, and it also provides an excellent ROI scalability. It’s a 
pity that ROI coding in JPEG2000 just performs well in the frame-based mode rather than in the strip-based 
mode, and thus the buffer and the hardware cost is a heavy burden.  
To overcome these limitations, a strip-based image compression algorithm based on the CCSDS standard 
providing the ROI scalability is proposed in this study. From the simulation results, it is obvious that the 
performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive to JPEG2000, and moreover, the performance of the 
proposed algorithm is still good in the strip-based mode. The proposed algorithm not only keeps the 
advantages of low complexity and high compression performance of the CCSDS standard, but also provides 
the strip-based ROI scalability that could not be realized in JPEG2000. The compatibility with existing 
CCSDS hardware systems and the supply of the strip-based ROI scalability make it easier to be implemented 
in hardware design, and furthermore, the cost of the image processing hardware system could be effectively 
decreased.

ABSTRACT
JPEG standard is commonly used for the still image com-
pression. However, the DCT-based coding of JPEG is one
of the lossy compression tools and introduces most artifacts
in the decompressed image such as blocking and ringing ar-
tifacts. In this paper, our proposed method focuses on how
to efﬁciently detect the blocks which cause ringing artifacts.
Moreover, these ringing blocks will be further ﬁltered and the
texture region will be able to preserve as well as the smooth
region. Simulation results show that our proposed method
can outperform the related algorithms in subjectively and ob-
jectively. By comparing JPEG compressed image, the de-
compressed image using our algorithm can achieve the bet-
ter PSNR as well as the visual performance, especially at the
lower quality coding (the higher compression rate).

1. INTRODUCTION
Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is the most com-
mon compression standard for the still image. It also referred
to as the DCT-based coding because discrete cosine transform
(DCT) is applied for the removal of the spatial redundancy.
After transform and quantization, a lack of some coefﬁcients
in higher frequency leads to the inevitable artifacts such as
blocking, ringing, blur, etc. [1]. Hence, the compressed im-
age may contain the different effects of the particular regions
depending on the image characteristics and the compression
rate. In addition, ringing artifacts is much more difﬁcult to
reduce than other kinds of artifacts in the block-based image
coding [2]. Our proposed method devoted on the deringing
algorithm. Take Fig. 1 as an example, it presents the percep-
tible effects, namely the ringing artifacts. Ringings usually
occur in the nearby object edge. Therefore, the mainly so-
lution of ringing detection rely on the capability of the edge
detection.

Many the post processing strategies have been proposed
for detecting the ringing of JPEG image. And, the low-pass
ﬁlters have been used for reducing the ringing artifacts caused
by the DCT-based coding. In [3], Kartalov et al. proposed an
algorithm for artifacts removal based on the theory of pro-
jections onto convex sets (POCS) and by comparing the in-
formation about the directions of image gradients. Zhai et
al. [4] proposed a deringing algorithm using the quadtree de-
composition (QT) to ﬁnd the potential location which occurs
ringings and using the block-shift ﬁltering (BSF) to remove
the spurious oscillation of the JPEG image. However, it re-
quires much computation for QT decomposition. In addition,
The fast algorithm for eliminating compression artifacts has
been proposed [5]. They developed an adaptive fuzzy ﬁlter to
suppress blocking and ringing artifacts depending on the both
edge and texture directional. In [6], detecting ringing artifacts
based on the analysis of DCT coefﬁcient with applying the
k-mean clustering was proposed, and implementing the Bilat-
eral ﬁlter to correct the ringing regions. It can be efﬁciently
implemented without storing the entire image in memory.
In this paper, we have proposed an improved method that
providing the efﬁcient strategy for detecting ringings without
a lot of computational complexity and utilizing the range ﬁl-
ter to eliminate the ringing region with preserving the edge
region simultaneously. The proposed algorithm applies the
local available information to achieve much computational

block which contains edge pixels should be found in each
non-overlapped 8× 8 block. First, each pixel Pel(x, y) of an
decompressed image will be divided into two categories, the
possible edge pixel (PE) and the non-edge pixel (NE).
Pel(x, y) ∈
{
PE , if Gpel > Te
NE , otherwise. (4)
where Gpel is the gradient of Pel(x, y) and the threshold Te
is adjusted according to the max gradient of an image Gmax,
Te =
{
300 , if Gmax > 950
100 , otherwise. (5)
Based on the result of the pixel classiﬁcation, an 8 × 8
block will be further determined as the possible edge block
or the non-edge block. As shown in Fig. 5, there are only 28
boundary pixels of a block for testifying. If one of boundary
pixels belongs to the PE, this 8 × 8 block will be a possi-
ble edge block Bp; the non-edge block Bne will be directly
output or otherwise.
Fig. 5. 28 boundary pixels of an 8× 8 block
3.2. Check the Neighboring Regions of the Possible Edge
Block
Since ringing artifacts are usually perceptible around the
edges and there exist non-edge regions such as smooth/detail,
we need further check the possible block to avoid determining
a non-edge block (textures) as an edge block. Therefore, we
consider four 4× 4 subblocks from the left and right sides of
the possible edge block to check the possible edge block as
shown in Fig. 6.
After checking, the possible edge block will be deter-
mined as the true edge block Be if at least one of four neigh-
bors belongs to the non-edge (i.e., all gradient value of 4× 4
are less than Te), and it will be ﬁltered by the range ﬁlter to
obtain Be RF .
3.3. Content-Aware Determination
Finally, some blocks still be uncertain blocks B′p followed
the above procedure. We employ the difference of variance
between the edge block and ﬁltered edge block to verify these
uncertain blocks. As shown in Fig. 3, the range ﬁlter can
preserve the edge. The variance of the edge block and ﬁlter

blocks.
edge block may be similarity. The possible edge block B′p
can be determined as the true edge block if it satisﬁes the
following condition.
B′p ∈

where the difference of the variance Diff. between B′p and
Bp′ RF is given as follows.

and Td is given empirically as
Td ∈

4. SIMULATION RESULTS
In our simulation, we have performed the JPEG images with
the different characters and the quality factor QF to evaluate
our proposed method. In (3), the parameter σr of range ﬁlter
used in our simulations is 30 if Gmax > 950; σr = 10 or
otherwise.
Table 1 and 2 describe that the PSNR gain of each algo-
rithm compared to JPEG image with different QF . We have
the better PSNR gain outperforms the comparative method in
lower QF . In addition, Fig.7 and 8 show that the visual qual-
ity of our method also surpass that of other algorithms.

AN EFFICIENT METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF RINGING 
ARTIFACTS AND DE-RINGING IN JPEG IMAGE 
 
Abstract 
JPEG standard is commonly used for the still image compression. However, the 
DCT-based coding of JPEG is one of the lossy compression tools and introduces most 
artifacts in the decompressed image such as blocking and ringing artifacts. In this 
paper, our proposed method focuses on how to efficiently detect the blocks which 
cause ringing artifacts. Moreover, these ringing blocks will be further filtered and the 
texture region will be able to preserve as well as the smooth region. Simulation results 
show that our proposed method can outperform the related algorithms in subjectively 
and objectively. By comparing JPEG compressed image, the decompressed image 
using our algorithm can achieve the better PSNR as well as the visual performance, 
especially at the lower quality coding (the higher compression rate).
