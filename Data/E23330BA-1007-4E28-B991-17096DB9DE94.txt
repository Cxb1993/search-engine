ABSTRACT 
A three-dimensional inverse design problem is examined in this study for 
estimating the optimal non-uniform fin widths of an impingement heat sink module 
using a general purpose commercial code (CFD-ACE+) and the Levenberg-Marquardt 
Method (LMM). The optimal heat sink was designed based on the original 10 by 10 
squared fin array with a fixed fin volume and height. The objective of this study is to 
minimize the thermal resistance (Rth) of the fin array and to obtain the optimal 
dimensions of non-uniform fin widths. The results obtained using the LMM to solve 
this three-dimensional fin design problem were initially justified numerically. Under 
the design operating condition Re = 5000, Rth can be decreased by 12.98 % and 4.81 
% compared to the original and to Yang and Peng’s optimal heat sinks, respectively. 
At the same time, the thermal performances of the optimal heat sink can be improved 
significantly. For instance, the Nusselt number (Nu) and the Coefficient of 
Enhancement (COE) can be increased by 14.92 % and 15 %, respectively, compared 
to the original heat sink, and these parameters can be increased by 5.06 % and 3 %, 
respectively, when compared to the optimal heat sink proposed by Yang and Peng. 
Finally, prototypes of the original and optimized heat sinks were fabricated and used 
to experimentally verify the validity of this work. The experimental results 
demonstrated that by utilizing the fabricated heat sinks and operating under the design 
condition Re = 5000, Rth can be decreased by 12.49 % and Nu and COE can be 
increased by 14.21 % and 14 %, respectively, compared to the original fin array. 
Consequently, the thermal performances of optimal impingement heat sinks can be 
greatly improved.

the products. 
The heat sink with an impinging jet has been widely utilized for conventional 
electronics cooling because of its favorable unit price, weight and reliability. For this 
reason, the use of impinging air jets on a heat sink is the most common method to 
enhance air-cooling. This also implies that the optimization process must be effective 
when designing heat sinks. 
Many researchers have extensively studied the thermal and hydraulic 
characteristics of various impinging heat sinks. Brignoni and Garimella [1] 
experimentally studied the optimization of confined impinging air jets used in 
conjunction with a pin-fin heat sink. The ranges of enhancement factors for the heat 
sink were found to be between 2.8–9.7 relative to a bare surface. Maveety and 
Hendricks [2] conducted a performance study of pin-fin heat sinks with impingement 
cooling by considering the effects of geometry, nozzle-to-heat sink vertical placement, 
material, and the Reynolds number. The results indicated that the best performance 
was achieved when the dimensionless impingement distance was between 8 and 12 
and the Reynolds number was between 40000 and 50000.  
Sansoucy et al. [3] experimentaly studied the heat transfer from a parallel flat-
plate heat sink under a turbulent air jet impingement. The forced convection heat 
transfer rates from both a flat plate and a flat-plate heat sink under an impinging 
confined jet were obtained. The thermal performance of pin-fin and plate-fin heat 
sinks with confined impingement cooling was investigated by Li et al. [4] and Li and 
Chen [5] using infrared thermography.  
Yang and Peng [6] numerically investigated the thermal performance of a heat 
sink with a non-uniform fin width design with impingement cooling. In their study, 
they intuitively and without any theoretical basis designed four types of heat sinks 
with non-uniform fin widths. Along with the original uniform fin width design, the 
Nusselt numbers and coefficients of performance for five impingement heat sinks 
were calculated and compared. They concluded that the type-2 design had the best 
thermal performance.

design problem studied by Yang and Peng [6] by utilizing the LMM. The objective is 
to further reduce the thermal resistance of their optimal heat sink by employing our 
inverse design algorithm to determine the optimal width of fins in an impingement 
heat sink and to further improve the thermal performance of their heat sink module.  
Without experimental verification, it is difficult to demonstrate that the present 
design algorithm can be used in practice. For this reason, the estimated optimal heat 
sinks in this study will be fabricated and their temperatures will be measured using an 
infrared thermal scanner. These temperatures will be compared with the numerically 
calculated temperatures to evaluate the accuracy of our computations and estimations. 
 
2. THE DIRECT PROBLEM 
The following three-dimensional impingement heat sink module is used to 
illustrate the methodology for developing expressions for the optimal dimensions of 
non-uniform fin widths for the impingement heat sink module in this inverse design 
problem using CFD-ACE+ and LMM.  
Let  represent the domain of computation and 1 2{ } { }    , where 1 
represents the heat sink fin array region and 2 represents the air flow region. All 
outer boundary fin surfaces are subjected to Robin-type boundary conditions with 
heat transfer coefficient h and ambient temperature T . A heat flux q is imposed on 
Ah of the bottom surface of heat sink module Ab, while the remainder of the bottom 
surface of the fin array remains insulated. Figure 1(a) shows the geometry of the 
computational domain of the impingement heat sink module, and Figure 1(b) 
illustrates its bottom and heating surfaces.   
The mathematical formulation of the energy equation for the 3-D fin domain 1 
is given by:

Yang and Peng [6] numerically examined the thermal performances of the 
impingement cooling heat sink module with a non-uniform fin width design. Four 
different types of heat sinks with non-uniform fin widths were intuitively designed in 
their study. The thermal performances of the heat sinks were then computed and 
compared with the original uniform fin width design. They concluded that the type-2 
design had the best performance. The above study is not related to any design 
problem because no design algorithm was applied. 
The objective of this study is to utilize the Levenberg-Marquardt Method 
(LMM) design algorithm to re-examine the same impingement heat sink design 
problem that was recently studied by Yang and Peng [6]. The goal is to further reduce 
the thermal resistance of their optimal heat sink by determining the optimal fin widths 
of the impingement heat sink. 
A commonly observed heat sink module with 10 by 10 squared fins is 
illustrated in Figure 2(a). The indices of the fin numbers and fin channel passages are 
given in Figure 2(b). The fin width can vary from fin to fin, and the fin height and 
volume are fixed. The fin array volume V can be calculated using the following 
equation: 
2 21 2 3 4 5V (L b)+(W +W +W +W +W ) H 4     mm3 (7) 
Where L and b are the width and thickness of the heat sink base, respectively. 
W1 to W5 and H are the fin widths and fin height, respectively, and G is the fin pitch. 
Here, L, b, G and H are known parameters, while W1, W2, W3 and W4 are the design 
variables for the heat sink modules considered in this study. W5 can be determined 
using Equation (7) with a desired fin array volume V. The shape of an impingement 
heat sink module can be constructed with known or estimated values for the above 
variables.  
For the impingement heat sink design problem considered here, a desired and 
fixed fin array volume V is given while the design variables W1, W2, W3 and W4 are 
unknown. In addition, the thermal resistance of the heat sink is required to be 
minimized to increase the thermal performance and efficiency of the module. Based 
 10
Equation (9) is minimized with respect to the estimated parameters Wi to obtain 
the following expression:

 ; j = 1 to P, (10) 
Equation (10) is linearized by expanding Rth(Wi) in a Taylor series and retaining the 
first-order terms. Then, a damping parameter n is added to the resulting expression to 
improve the convergence, leading to the Levenberg-Marquardt method [17], which is 
given by: 
n(  + )  F I W D   (11) 
F=T　  (12)  
D=TA  (13) 
n+1 n   W W W   (14) 
Here, the superscripts n and T represent the iteration index and the transpose matrix, 
respectively, I is the identity matrix, and  denotes the Jacobian matrix, which is 
defined as: 
th
T
R  W
  (15) 
The Jacobian matrix defined by Equation (15) is determined by perturbing the 
unknown parameters Wi one at a time and computing the resulting change in the 
thermal resistance Rth from the solution of the direct problem, Equations (1) to (6). 
Equation (11) is now written as follows, which is suitable for iterative calculation:

The algorithm for choosing this damping value n  is described in detail by 
Marquardt [17]. The bridges between CFD-ACE+ and LMM are the 
INPUT/OUTPUT files. These files should be arranged such that their format can be 
recognized by CFD-ACE+ and LMM. A sequence of forward problems is solved by 
CFD-ACE+ to update the design variables for the heat sink by minimizing the 
difference between the estimated and desired thermal resistance under the present 
algorithm.

the heating block, which is in contact with the bottom of the heat sink, measures 40 
mm × 40 mm. The temperatures of the impinging jet and the heating block are 
measured using T-type thermocouples. The surface temperature distribution of the 
heat sink is measured using an infrared thermography system (FLIR System’s 
ThermaCAM FLIR A325), which has an accuracy of 2 %. The surface is painted with 
a black paint that has an emissivity of 0.9. 
The infrared thermal images are displayed and stored on a personal computer. 
The infrared thermography system has the advantage of non-contact and large area 
temperature measurements. Lefevre and Niliot [19] and Huang et al. [20] applied this 
technique to engineering problems. The experimental data at steady state are recorded 
for further examination. 
The uncertainty analysis for the experimental data is calculated according to the 
procedure outlined by Kline [21]. The uncertainties of the Reynolds number, the 
heating power, and the thermal resistance for the experiments are estimated to be 2%, 
2.72%, and 4.83%, respectively. 
 
7. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The LMM is applied in the present study to determine the optimal fin widths of 
an impingement cooling heat sink module. To illustrate the reliability of the LMM in 
predicting the optimal fin widths of the heat sink with a specified fin array volume by 
minimizing the thermal resistance of the heat sink, the following optimal heat sink 
design problem will be considered. 
Alumina alloy will be considered for the heat sink module material, the thermal 
conductivity is taken as k = 168 W/(m-K), and the input heating power is chosen as Q 
= 50 W. Here, L = 80 mm, L4 = 40mm , H = 40 mm, b = 8 mm, G = 2 mm and V = 
204960 mm3 are used for all the cases considered in this work. The applied boundary 
heat flux generated by electric power is calculated as q = Q/Ah = 50/0.0016 = 31250 
W/m2 and is utilized in all the cases considered in this work. The dimension for the 
computational domain is taken as L1 L2 L3 = 210 mm 210 mm 112 mm.   

the optimal and Yang and Peng’s heat sinks than in the original heat sinks. Figures 
6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) illustrate the air flow distributions in the channel 3 fin passage of 
the original, Yang and Peng’s and the optimal heat sinks. Figure 6(a) shows that a 
pair of vortexes occurred next to the impinging location, preventing air from entering 
into the channel 3 fin passage and reducing the air mass flow rate in the original heat 
sink. Furthermore, the air flow distributions in the channel 3 fin passage of Yang and 
Peng’s heat sink show that the non-uniform fin widths proposed by Yang and Peng 
[6], which were optimized by trial-and-error, partially destroyed the structure of the 
vortex. As shown in Figure 6(b), this allowed more air to enter the channel 3 fin 
passage, increasing the  air mass flow rate in their heat sink. 
However, by utilizing the present inverse design algorithm with LMM, the 
optimal heat sink with optimal dimensions of the non-uniform fin widths can be 
designed to increase the mass flow rate of air and further improve the thermal 
performance in this optimal heat sink. It is obvious from Figure 6(c) that more air will 
enter into the optimal heat sink in the channel 3 fin passage than in Yang and Peng’s 
heat sink.  
The total mass flow rates in the fin channel passages for three types of heat 
sinks are calculated as 31.015 10  kg/s, 31.077 10  kg/s and 31.137 10  kg/s for 
the original, Yang and Peng’s [6] and the optimal heat sinks, respectively. This result 
implies a 12.02 % and 5.57 % increase in the air mass flow rate for optimal heat sink 
compared to the original and Yang and Peng’s heat sinks, respectively. This result 
also explains, based on the observations in Figures 4, 5 and 6, why the optimal heat 
sink module has the lowest temperature distribution of the three designs. 
Next, we use these types of heat sinks at three different impinging velocities 
and compute the thermal performances of the heat sinks. The impinging velocity first 
increases to Re = 10000 and to Re = 15000 and 20000. The computed thermal 
performances of thermal resistance (Rth), Nusselt number (Nu) and coefficient of 
enhancement (COE) can be obtained from the numerical temperature data. The 
calculated values of Rth, Nu and COE are summarized in Table 1.

with the original heat sink. 
Figures 9(a) and 9(b) illustrate the top views of the experimental and numerical 
temperature distributions, respectively, at Re = 5000. Figures 9(c) and 9(d) show the 
experimental and numerical temperature distributions, respectively, at Re = 15000 for 
the original heat sink module. For the optimal heat sink module, Figures 10(a) and 
10(b) show the top views of the experimental and numerical temperature distributions, 
respectively, at Re = 5000. Figures 10(c) and 10(d) present the experimental and 
numerical temperature distributions, respectively, at Re = 15000. 
The averaged numerical and experimental temperatures of the base plate of the 
heat sink module, Tave, for the original and optimal heat sinks at various impinging 
velocities are summarized in Table 2. The maximum error between the numerical and 
experimental Tave in Table 2 was 2.5 %, implying that the numerical solutions for the 
temperature distributions in the heat sinks are very accurate. 
Figures 11(a), 11(b), 11(c) and 11(d) were prepared to closely observe the 
temperature distributions in the channels of the base fin plate. These figures compare 
the numerical and experimental temperature distributions in the channel 1 fin passage 
of the original heat sink module at Re = 5000, 10000, 15000 and 20000, respectively. 
Similarly, Figures 12(a), 12(b), 12(c) and 12(d) compare the numerical and 
experimental temperature distributions in the channel 1 fin passage of the optimal 
heat sink module at Re = 5000, 10000, 15000 and 20000, respectively. 
The peak of the temperature distribution occurs at the center of the base fin 
plate because that is where the heating area is located. From Figures 11 and 12, it can 
be observed that there is an excellent agreement between the measured and calculated 
temperatures. When the impinging velocity is slow, i.e., Re = 5000, there is a 
significant temperature decrease in the optimal heat sink module. As a result, the 
thermal resistance of the optimal heat sink module can be decreased by a large 
percentage. However, when the impinging velocity increases from 10000 to 15000 
and then to 20000, the temperature difference between the original and optimal heat

A three-dimensional inverse design problem is examined in this study for estimating 
the optimal non-uniform fin widths of an impingement heat sink module using a 
general purpose commercial code (CFD-ACE+) and the Levenberg-Marquardt Method 
(LMM). The optimal heat sink was designed based on the original 10 by 10 squared 
fin array with a fixed fin volume and height. The objective of this study is to
minimize the thermal resistance (Rth) of the fin array and to obtain the optimal 
dimensions of non-uniform fin widths. The results obtained using the LMM to solve 
this three-dimensional fin design problem were initially justified numerically. 
Under the design operating condition Re = 5000, Rth can be decreased by 12.98 % 
and 4.81 % compared to the original and to Yang and Peng＇s optimal heat sinks, 
respectively. At the same time, the thermal performances of the optimal heat sink 
can be improved significantly. For instance, the Nusselt number (Nu) and the 
Coefficient of Enhancement (COE) can be increased by 14.92 % and 15 %, respectively, 
compared to the original heat sink, and these parameters can be increased by 5.06 
% and 3 %, respectively, when compared to the optimal heat sink proposed by Yang
