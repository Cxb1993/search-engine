rhythms, various paradigms in terms of reciprocal
inhibition, synergic co-activations and cooperative
co-activations will be examined.  Particular emphasis
will be placed upon the detection and diagnosis of the
emergence of abnormal rhythms and disappearance
of normal rhythms during the interactions using
fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and fractional
Gaussian noise (FGN) of dynamical systems (31, 48,
49, 51).  Finally, methods that can help restore normal
rhythms or control pathological ones in dynamical
diseases will also be reviewed.
Rhythmogenesis in Physiology
Pacemaker oscillations modeled by nonlinear
differential equations played an important role in
generating physiological rhythms.  Hodgkin and
Huxley used properties of ionic channels in the mem-
brane of giant squid axon to construct the dynamical
equations for the generation of action potentials (41).
In their models, the action potentials were generated
as a result of sodium and potassium ionic channels
that would open and close as a result of electrical or
chemical changes in an axon’s intracellular and ex-
tracellular environment.  The membrane currents that
fluctuated according to the opening and closing of
ionic channels were mainly contributed by the con-
centration gradients, membrane conductance and
membrane capacitance.  The techniques developed by
these authors were adopted to studying the mechanism
of cardiac rhythmogenesis.  Moreover, it was believed
that this type of cellular mechanism could be extended
to cells that are excitable.  However, the number of
ionic channels of a typical cell is at least of the order
103 of each different type.  Hence, the mathematical
modeling of ionic channels for physiological systems
is still a difficult task.
There are other drawbacks too.  For instance,
the experimentally observed discontinuous phase-
resetting function could hardly be accounted for by
models formulated as differential equations (38).
Furthermore, the sodium and other membrane pumps
in the ionic theory of action potential could suffer
from insufficiency in energy to operate.  Hence, an
adsorption and induction hypothesis was conjectured
that the action potential was actually due to the result
of transient variation of the surface adoption po-
tentials on one or both sides of the membrane (46).
Consequently, there was no need of continual energy
expenditure in describing the resting potential.  How-
ever, the experimental tests of the propagation of
electric polarizations or inductive effects along the
excitable membranes were sketchy and more studies
were required.
Another class of models was proposed for motor
rhythms in the central pattern generators of mammals –
the neural network interaction models.  The cells in the
network might receive tonic inputs that led to rhythms
due to network interactions.  Mechanisms involving
mutual inhibition and sequential disinhibition had
been proposed in diverse contexts (5, 38).  As to the
sequential disinhibition model, it was postulated that
there were functionally distinct pools of neurons that
received excitatory input such that the interactions
within each single pool was excitatory.  However, the
interactions among these pools were inhibitory that
the activities in the first pool tended to inhibit those
of the second.  Once the second pool of neurons was
inhibited, the third one could then become active since
it was disinhibited. This type of model had been used
in the rhythmogenesis of respiration (38).  However,
unambiguous identification of such networks had
not yet occurred.  Furthermore, this type of network
models would be difficult in quantitatively explain-

be very convincing.  For instance, the sense of déjà vu
that has to do with long-term memory certainly has a
time span much longer than milliseconds or minutes.
Secondly, the experiments performed would usually
need stronger stimuli to produce inhibitory responses
while weaker stimuli often resulted in excitation (50).
Hence, it would be curious to ask if the inhibitory
hyperpolarization was actually derived from over-
stimulation and exhaustion of these synapses as
suggested by Schiff more than a century ago.  This
issue can definitely be resolved if direct proofs of
inhibitory response of synaptic plasticity in freely
moving non-anaesthetized animals or humans are
provided.
Recently, based on the studies of micturition
and storage of urine in Wistar rats (12, 15, 17-19),
elbow flexion in humans and the forearm pronation
for patients of radial nerve palsy, the so-called
reciprocal inhibitions were not observed (13, 14).
Instead, synergic and cooperative co-activation in
normal physiological rhythms was found.  For in-
stance, during the voiding phase of micturition, the
rhythms of the detrusor and EUS of Wistar rats were
synchronized around 7 Hz and their intensities as
functions of time were temporally correlated to
facilitate the concerted voiding process (15).  On the
other hand, for the spinal cord-injured rats, either the
temporal strength or its underlying synchronization
of rhythms was impaired, weakened or completely
vanished depending on the degrees of injury (15).  As
to the characterization of urine storage, it was also
found that the EUS of Wistar rats was not activated.
It was the cooperative sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic nerve activities of the bladder in female
Wistar rats that were dominant (12).
As to the human forearm pronation, the surface
electromyograms (EMG) included the short and long
heads of the biceps brachii (BBSH, BBLH), the
brachialis (B), the lateral head of the triceps brachii
(TBLTH), brachioradialis (BR) and pronator teres
(PT) were recorded during action.  Experimental
results of the healthy group indicated that the surface
EMGs of all muscles were temporally synchronized
in frequencies with persistent intensities (14).  Hence,
all involved muscle groups were in synergic co-
activation.  As to the group of patients of radial nerve
palsy, results indicated that the EMG might have
bursting activities, but either the synchronized sig-
nificant frequencies were lacking or the intensities
as indicated from their fractal dimensions were not
persistent.  The same situation was found for the
elbow flexion case (13).
The theoretical foundation for the afore-
mentioned results was based on the models of FGN
and FBM (49).  They were proposed to model in-
teracting physiological rhythms from neural or mus-
cular systems (12-19).  The rationale behind these
models was motivated by the theory of dynamical
systems.  They could be described as follows and
more detailed descriptions could be found in (43).  In
general, a dynamical system is defined as the triple
(M, µ, φ t), where M is a compact manifold, µ a
measure on M, and φt : M → M a one parameter group
of continuous, measure-preserving transformation.
The parameter t could be a real number or an integer.
When it is an integer, φt is generated by a measure-
preserving transformation φ = φ1.  The discrete
dynamical system can be denoted as (M, µ, φ).  A
simple example for such a discrete dynamical system
is to let M be the torus {(x, y)(mod1), the measure
µ = dxdy, and φ(x, y) = (2x + y, x + y)(mode1).  This
Anosov dynamical system on the compact torus is
structurally stable, ergodic, mixing, and has dense
periodic orbits (43).  Other transformations are also
possible.  For instance, if we set φ(x, y) = (x + ω1, y +
ω2)(mode1), the orbits of φ would be periodic or
dense depending on whether the ratio of ω1/ω2 is
rational or not.  The aforementioned variables x and y
could represent the phases of the rhythms in sym-
pathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, or
those in the interaction of cardiac and pulmonary
rhythms in physiological applications.  If the torus is
taken to be our phase space of interacting rhythms,
the set {e2πi( px + qy)} where p and q are integers is an
orthonormal basis of L2(M, µ).  Each individual
physiological signal can be viewed as the projection
of L2(M, µ) functions on its proper subspace.  In
physiological applications, when many neural or
muscle fibers are superposed, the rhythms can be
defined formally as an infinite series of oscillations
with random amplitudes ξne2π inxΣn = – ∞
∞
 where {ξn} is a
sequence of independent and identically distributed
standard Gaussian random variables.  Notice that this
infinite sum is not convergent, but if we integrate it
with respect to x from 0 to t as the cumulative effects
of time, the integral B(t) = ξne2π inxΣn = – ∞

 will con-
verge almost surely and in the L2 sense.  It turns out
that this integral is the rigorous mathematical con-
struction of the Brownian movement proposed in
the 1930s by Norbert Wiener (51) and it is used later
in his studies on brain waves.  Hence, the Brownian
motion is a good model for the cumulative effects of
many neural or muscle fibers.  It is worth noting that
the increments of the Brownian motion are stationary
and independent (26).  Yet, empirical studies often
suggested the existence of long-term dependence
between samples.  Thus, B. Mandelbrot proposed in
1968 the FBM with correlated increments for practical
applications.  Detailed formulations of FBM and
FGN are defined in (49) and are not repeated here.

to improve the micturition functions for these SCI
rats.  The procedures were as indicated in (17).  The
results are illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7.  The EMG and
CMG of the EUS and bladder of a SCI Wistar rat
under the treatment of RTX are demonstrated in Fig.
6.  In Fig. 6(a), the bursting electrical signals between
18 to 23 sec were during the voiding phase.  In Fig.
6(d), the CMG showed the alteration of the bladder
pressure.  The Cmax in Fig. 6(b) was 0.07 n.u. and the
Cmax in Fig. 6(e) was 0.06 n.u.  Both subplots had
synchronized frequencies around 3 Hz with rather
small amplitudes as compared to 0.12 and 0.14 n.u.
in Fig. 4(b) and 4(e).  In Figs. 6(c) and 6(f), the FDs
for EMG and CMG both fell in temporal coherence
during 18 to 23 sec.  However, the FDs of CMG were
not smaller than 1.5 as compared to that of the intact
rats in Fig. 4(f).  Hence, we can see that the RTX rat
has “weak” synergy during voiding due to the “weak”
synchronization of rhythms and “weak” coherence
of FDs.
Fig. 7 demonstrates the EMG of EUS and CMG
of bladder of a SCI Wistar rat under the treatment of
capsaicin.  In Fig. 7(a), the bursting electrical signals
between 20 to 25 sec were during the voiding phase.
In Fig. 7(d), the CMG of the bladder pressure was not
very clear in identifying the period of voiding.  The
Cmax in Fig. 7(b) was 0.13 n.u. and the Cmax in Fig.
7(e) was 0.00013 n.u.  Both subplots did not have
synchronized frequencies anymore.  In Fig. 7(c), the
FDs for EMG fell below 1.5 indicating strong
oscillations. However, in Fig. 7(f), the FDs of CMG
did not have any temporal coherence with those of the
EMG.  Hence, we could contend that the rat under
capsaicin treatment was less effective as compared to
the treatment of RTX since the latter had “weak”
synergy during voiding while the former had not.
This conclusion was later confirmed by examining
the residual volume of urine in the bladders of the SCI
rats (17).  It is believed that this type of functional
evaluation can also be applied to efficacy studies of
Chinese medicinal herbs.
Another interesting application of the dynamical
system approach on spatial and temporal changes of
blood pressure, heart rate variability and encephalo-
grams (EEGs) was via the acupuncture at Neiguan
(PC 6) (10, 11).  Fig. 8(a) is the typical radial arterial
pulse wave that would correspond to the arterial
blood pressures at the root of aorta.  For instance; the
magnitude of percussion wave, denoted by P, of radial
artery was proportional to systolic pressure and the
base point A was proportional to diastolic pressure at
the root of aorta.  The average of P and A, i.e., (P+A)/
2, was then proportional to mean blood pressure.  As
to the dicrotic notch, or valley V in the pulse wave, it

Fig. 11, the spatial distributions of signal power for
12 channels before and after acupuncture are dis-
played.  In Fig. 11(a), the average power was bluer in
color which indicated that the power was relatively
lower before acupuncture at PC 6.  In Fig. 11(b), the
average power was yellower in color which indicated
that the power was relatively higher after acupuncture.
In addition to the spatial changes, the EEGLAB
program could also be used to plot the temporal
changes of the 12 channels in Fig. 12.  One could
notice that the peaks in the alpha band for all 12
channels were erratic before the acupuncture, but
almost all were synchronized during manual acu-
puncture and even completely synchronized after
acupuncture.  The frequencies of 12 channels were
quite varied with a mean value of 8.300 Hz and a
standard deviation of 0.176 Hz in the alpha band
before manual acupuncture.  During acupuncture,
the frequencies of 12 channels were almost all syn-
chronized at 8.202 Hz with rather smaller standard
deviation of 0.081 Hz.  Finally, after manual acu-
puncture, the frequencies were all synchronized at
8.008 Hz with a very small standard deviation of
2.03E-07 Hz.

Figs. 9-12, it is clear that the rhythmic changes

increase and it will mismatch the impedance of its
corresponding meridian.  As a result, the normal
neurovascular flow will be partially reflected back
from the needed organ in the network.  For instance,
the pericardial meridian that is associated with the
functions of the pericardium runs down inside the
arm.  The cardiac tamponade can reduce cardiac
output and patients may develop hypotension and
circulatory collapse (58).  This condition can be
characterized by an increase of impedance in the
pericardium, say Z3 as in Fig. 13.  Consequently, a
portion of traveling waves of neurovascular flow to
the pericardium will be reflected back due to the
mismatch of impedance values between Z2 and Z3,
i.e., Z2 ≠ Z3 in this case.  If we use manual acupunc-
ture at PC 6 along the pericardial meridian, the current
of injury derived from the insertion of the needle will
reduce the transmission line capacitance yet without
changing too much of its longitudinal inductance
of the neurovascular bundle (20).  As is well known
in the theory of communication networks, for an
almost lossless transmission line, the impedance is
roughly proportional to the square root of inductance
to capacitance.  Hence, after the control input of
acupuncture at PC 6, the impedance of the pericardial
meridian Z2 will now be increased and possibly
matched with the new Z3 of the malfunctioned peri-
cardium.  The outcome is that there is no partial
reflection and standing wave of the flow.  The normal
neurovascular flow to the pericardium will be re-
sumed and the normal cardiac output and blood
pressure can possibly be restored.  The blood pressure
variations during this whole process will be very
similar to the ones presented in Fig. 9.  Similar rea-
soning can be applied to explain the effect of pain
relief via acupuncture.  For example, the power of
electric potential in Fig. 11(b) is higher than that of
Fig. 11(a) after acupuncture.  The impedance of the
brain is now mismatched with that of the afferent
pathway; hence the afferent pain signals are partially
reflected back.  As a result, pain relief can be achieved.
It is plausible to conjecture that the mechanism of
acupuncture is basically through this type of im-
pedance matching/mismatching of meridians with its
associated organs.  Certainly, further studies will be
required to validate these claims.
Finally, it is worth noting that the aforemen-
tioned meridian model is based on the cable theory
and communication network.  The mechanism of
acupuncture is then explained by the concepts of
impedance matching and traveling waves via control
input at specific sites of such a network.  So far, it is
not easy to find a feasible model based on synaptic
connections with billions of neurons.  The reason is
mainly due to an astronomical number of neurons
and synapses.  It is well known that the number of
neurons in the brain is close to 100 billion.  Each
cortical neuron integrates information from perhaps
hundreds of nearby cells and each neuron has been
estimated to receive about tens of thousands of
synapses.  Hence, there are many billions of hierar-
chical neurons and synapses being active in the brain.
On the one hand, if one wants to use a parallel model
to describe the synchronization of neurons via syn-
aptic transmission, the spatial integration of neu-
rotransmitter release from these many delayed
synapses will definitely make surface EEG look more
like noise instead of synchronized rhythms.  On the
other hand, if one wants to use a serial model to
describe the synaptic transmission, the spatial inte-
gration of neurotransmitter releases from these
synapses will take days instead of seconds to achieve
synchronized oscillations.  However, the aforemen-
tioned model can be used to explain the synchroni-
zation of brain waves by invoking the frequency
locking of oscillations in reticular networks via
feedback mechanisms.  The mechanism is very similar
to the synchronization of lasers in synergetics, and
that of the EUS and bladder in micturition.
Conclusions
So far, progress and development of dynamical
diseases have been slow.  Two key factors are: 1)
difficulty in collecting long-term reliable data, and
2) the lack of simple analytic tools.  In this review,
we have examined several models that have been
proposed in basic researches and medical treatments.
Some of the prevailing models have defied simple
interpretations and lack the capability of diagnosing
and evaluating dynamical diseases.  Yet, the recently
proposed FGN and FBM models have been more
intuitive and easy to apply.  They have been success-
fully applied to the detection, diagnosis and evaluation
of normal and pathological rhythms in certain cases
of dynamical diseases.  For instance, both the effects
of drug therapy and acupuncture in dealing with
physiological rhythms have been examined.  In order
to give a plausible explanation on how acupuncture
works, a feasible model of meridians has been included
in this review.  It is believed that this will promote our
understanding in dealing with dynamical diseases.
