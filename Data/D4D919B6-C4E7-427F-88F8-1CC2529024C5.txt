Abstract 
Improved nanoindentation modulus and hardness in Cu thin film can be obtained by 
introducing the nanoscale layered structure with the RF sputter deposition. By brief stopping 
deposition after each individual layer, an ultrathin copper oxide layer can be formed through 
chemical oxidation between copper atoms on the top of the individual layer and irremovable 
oxygen in the high vacuum chamber. The Cu and copper oxide multilayers contain columnar 
grains, and their layer microstructures were studied with TEM.  The oxygen contents in the 
film were confirmed with EPMA, and the copper oxide layered structure was directly 
observed with AES nanoscope.  With XRD, the copper oxide was identified as Cu2O. The 
increase of hardness is due to dislocations in confined geometry and the hard phase copper 
oxide, and modulus increases come from the rule of mixture.

摘要 
本計畫的目的是以實驗及理論並行的方式，研究奈米金屬多層膜的力學性質，例如：楊
氏模數、硬度、張力降伏應力、疲勞、潛變等。近年來，奈米金屬多層膜應用廣泛，例
如：微機電原件、硬碟表面。土木建材外部亦可被鍍與此種奈米金屬多層膜。目前全世
界對奈米金屬多層膜的研發正處於高峰狀態，主要是因為其高降伏強度的發現，其機制
為差排堆積的減少。此外、差排被侷限在奈米層內運動，亦可增加整體奈米複合材強度。
奈米金屬多層膜的延展性及與時間相關的力學性質亦有良好表現。但是，這些結果必須
以更多的實驗加以確認。此外，目前對於奈米金屬多層膜，定量的理論基礎尚未發展完
整。多層銅膜的力學性質已由實驗的方式獲得，其力學性質優於銅塊材。

multilayers [22]. Hardness of multilayers can be improved by using positive enthalpy of 
formation [23], and the underlying mechanisms are due to dislocations being confined in 
nanoscale individual layers. Many theories have been proposed to account for the hardness 
enhancement in various systems. For example, the Hall-Petch grain-size relationship, solid 
solution strengthening, modulus difference, Orowan strengthening, coherency stress, 
structure difference and confined layered slip. Furthermore, high modulus and high hardness 
are often associated with each other. If a material shows large elastic changes under small 
load (low modulus), it tends to respond to large loads by deforming plastically (low 
hardness).   
 
In the present work, we manufactured the Cu/Cu multilayers via the RF sputter 
deposition, and demonstrated the formation of the ultrathin copper oxide layers between 
copper individual layers. The presence of the copper oxide layers makes the interfaces 
incoherent and hence increases the hardness of the multilayers. Additional increases in 
hardness may come from the hard phase, Cu2O, itself, and this hard phase also affects the 
modulus of the films.  
 
 
2. Experimental 
 
2.1 Sample preparation 
 
The 3” Cu target (99.99%) was provided by Alfa Aesar.  Three kinds of samples 
were prepared at room temperature by the RF sputter deposition in an ultra-high vacuum 
chamber: single layer Cu, Cu/Cu (8/50/423) multilayer and Cu/Cu2O (87(15)/17/1834) 
multilayer. The total thicknesses of the three samples, respectively, were 1000, 400 and 1834 
nm.  The Cu/Cu multilayer was manufactured, without oxygen partial pressure, by stopping 
deposition after every 8-nm thick individual layer for about 1 minute. It is expected that on

The analysis of chemical composition in terms of percentage in each component  
was studied with secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) The chemical composition 
analysis was performed with the Auger electron nanoscope (ULVAC-PHI-700). Mechanical 
properties of the multilayers were studied via nanoindentation with a Berkovich tip of 20 nm 
curvature radius.  The continuous stiffness method at 45 Hz of oscillation was adopted to 
obtain indentation modulus and hardness at various indentation depth. The displacement 
resolution was about 0.01 nm and load resolution about 50 nN. Repeated indentation tests 
were performed for statistical purposes.  
 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
  
The cross-sectional TEM image of the Cu/Cu multilayer is shown in Figure 1. The 
multilayer contains 50 individual copper layers, and there was a 60-second wait between each 
individual layers during the deposition. It is expected that the wait introduces an ultrathin 
layer between individual copper layers.  As can be seen, the layer structure cannot be 
observed from the TEM image due to the ultrathin interface. The inset at the upper-left corner 
shows the selected area electron beam diffraction, indicating the (111) texture of the Cu/Cu 
multilayer. The total thickness of the multilayer is about 423 nm, determined from the TEM 
image. A thin oxidized silicon layer is shown as a think white line next to Si (100) substrate. 
The small grey area between the oxidized silicon layer and the strongly textured area 
(deposited copper) is composed of Cu and Si, verified with EDX. This is a result of chemical 
reaction at the beginning of sputtering. The strongly textured area, Cu (111) layer, shows 
typical columnar grains for thin film prepared by sputtering technique. According to Figure 1, 
the d-spacings can be determined as 2.415, 2.033 and 1.772 A, and they correspond to the 
crystalline structures of cubic Cu2O (111) (JCPD#1-1142), cubic Cu (111) (JCPD#3-1015) 
and cubic Cu (200) (JCPD#1-085-1326), respectively.

Figure 2. XRD patterns of multilayers Cu-Cu2O, Cu-Cu and single Cu layer films. The 
single layer specimen does not show any copper oxide peaks. The Cu-Cu film shows 
weak copper oxide signals, indicating the intermitted stop time introduces thin copper 
oxide layers.  
The XRD data of N8846 and N0846 thick films for 846 nm on the Si substrate are 
shown in Figure 2 (b). During the sample deposition, the interruption time of about 60 
seconds between each Cu layer so the peaks of Cu2O are unapparent and show one strong 
different line for the (111) crystallographic plane with two smaller peaks for (200) and (220) 
crystallographic planes of copper. 
 
Chemical composition analysis in layered specimens measured by EPMA (electron 
probe x-ray microanalysis) is as follows. The single layer copper with thickness of 423 nm 
contained 99.05% copper and 0.95 % oxygen with ±0.38% error percentage. The Cu-Cu

Our chemical analysis of the multilayers are as follows. The layer structure can not be 
revealed in TEM cross-sectional images due to the very small layer thicknesses. In order to 
analyze the film compositions in depth and cross-section, the multilayer Cu film were depth 
profiled for the copper, oxygen, silicon and carbon distribution using secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy (SIMS). Figure 3 shows the SIMS depth profile of multilayered Cu film and 
single layer Cu film on Si substrates. The SIMS result does not clearly reveal the layer 
structure in 8/50/423. For AES analysis of samples, the line scan of electron beam was 
performed on the cross-sectional samples and the information of Auger electrons were taken 
for analysis. Figure 4 (a) presents the cross-sectional SEM microstructure of 8/50/423, the 
white area is the substrate and the gray area is the film. The line a cross the film is a line scan 
route of electron beam and has a angle about 50° with film, to obtain a longer scan line so 
that the each layer would be larger for easy analysis. The result is shown in Figure 4 (b). It 
shows quantitative analysis of sample 8/50/423 obtained by AES, and the fluctuations of 
copper and oxygen are not obvious. The high magnification of 8/50/423 was shown in Figure 
4 (d, c?) and the range from 0 to 0.35 µm of scanned line (Y-axis). The line scan of oxygen 
reveals the fluctuation pattern of oxygen intensity in the range from 0.025 to 0.125 µm of 
scanned line (Y-axis). The periodicity of Cu-Cu multilayers is about 0.008 µm, as calculated 
by the total film thickness (423nm) / 50 times interruption. According to AES resulting 
Figure 4 (d) the periodicity of peaks is about 0.025 µm larger than the layer thickness. The 
thickness of each layer is about 8 nm and the smallest analysis area size of AES is 10 nm in 
the best condition. The relative intensities of copper and oxygen show unapparent 
fluctuations and thus we are not able to confirm the layer structure in the films using SIMS 
depth profile and AES line scan methods.

mapping results of copper and oxygen are shown in Figure 6 (c) and (d), respectively. As 
seen in Figure 6 (c), the distribution of copper is uniform in the film. Figure 6 (d) reveals a 
periodic distribution of oxygen, confirming the layered structure in the film. The periodicity 
of the Cu-Cu2O multilayers is about 0.102 µm (Cu is 0.087 µm and Cu2O is 0.015 µm), as 
calculated by sputtering rates. According to the AES result in Figure 6 (d), the periodicity of 
layered structure is about 0.10 µm. The AES result thus is in agreement, within experimental 
error, with our film structure.

Nanoindentation Experimental results from the continuous stiffness method based on 
nanoindentation are shown in Figure 7 (a) for the Cu-Cu multilayered films and (b) for the 
single layer Cu film. Our results show clear evidence that the hardness of multilayer Cu-Cu 
film is larger than that of single layered Cu film for the same total film thickness of 423 nm. 
For the film with a larger thickness (846 nm), The hardness of single layer and multilayer 
with 100 nm for the individual layer thickness were 1.92 GPa and 2.13 GPa, respectively. 
The increase in hardness is understood due to the effects of nanoscale individual layers with 
intermitted stops for time on the order of minutes. Very thin oxide layers between Cu layers 
were formed during the intermission. By changing the individual layer thickness from 50 to 
100 nm, the overall hardness remains similar due to the confined layer slip mechanism causes 
the Orowan loops glide in the individual layers. When the individual layer thickness is on the 
order of a few nanometers, the increases in hardness become notable.  We remark that the 
hardness of Cu-Cu2O multilayers is higher than that of single layer copper and Cu-Cu 
multilayers, about 20%, due to the hard phase of the oxide. The modulus of the Cu-Cu2O

Conclusions 
 Multilayered copper and copper oxide films have been manufactured by the RF sputter 
deposition on the silicon substrate. The formation of the copper oxide layers can be achieved 
by either intermitted stops or deliberately performing reactive sputter deposition.  Through 
chemical composition analysis and microscopic studies, we have confirmed the layered 
structure of the films. Although the direct observations of the copper-copper multilayer made 
by intermitted stops were not feasible, our nanoindentation studies show that improved 
hardness due to confined layer slip for dislocations indicates the oxide layers behave as 
opaque interfaces. The layered structure enhances the hardness of the films, even with a few 
atomic thin oxide layers. The indentation modulus increases in the films are the result of the 
rule of mixtures for metal and metal oxide composites.
