ABSTRACT 
Continuing with the developed Buffer Evaluation Model (BEM) (NSC 94-2218-E-212 -011), this 
research focuses on developing a Multi-objective Precast Production Scheduling Model (MPPSM) 
using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Fabrication due days derived in BEM are served as absolute 
criteria for delivering production on time. One scheduling principle established based on lean 
concepts is elaborated for arranging production schedules, i.e. start fabrication later relative to 
required delivery dates. Limited resources, combination of moulds, and buffer sizes between 
stations are taken into account in the model. In the research, GAs are adopted for searching for 
optimum production schedules with fabrication due days, constraints, and adjustment principles. 
Performances of the proposed model are validated through real applications. Application results 
show that the multi-objective genetic algorithm can successfully search for optimum solutions for 
precast production model. In addition, considering buffer sizes between stations is crucial in 
acquiring reasonable and feasible precast production schedules. The established models 
considering demand variability in precast production scheduling using lean concepts improve 
production management as well as create a new approach and philosophy in precast production

1. Introduction 
Precast construction is a method to build up constructions by erecting prefabricated concrete 
elements (Bennett, 2005). To support construction schedule, precast fabricators deliver elements 
to construction site according to its erection schedule. Building up constructions using precast 
elements can therefore reduce uncertainty than those cast in the construction site, since 
construction elements are prefabricated in the factory. In addition, it fits with the needs of 
industrial process. Precast fabrication in the construction industry can thus be categorized as 
manufacturing (Ray et al., 2006). Production scheduling is one of the most important tasks in the 
manufacturing. Throughput, makespan, waiting time etc. are dominated by production schedules. 
To enhance fabricator’s competitiveness, production schedulers face challenges to satisfy 
multiple objectives since one objective may conflict with the others (Chan and Hu, 2002).  
The current practice of making precast production schedules depends on scheduler’s 
experience. Due to the inaccurate planning method, inefficient resource utilization and 
overstocking are commonplace in the precast industry (Dawood, 1993, Chan and Hu, 2002). 
Researchers have started using computational techniques to deal with the scheduling issues 
(Dawood and Neale, 1993; Leu and Hwang, 2001; Chan and Hu, 2002; Leu and Hwang, 2002; 
Chan and Hu, 2002; Benjaoran et al., 2005). Dawood and Neale (1993) and Vern and Gunal 
(1998) automated the process of precast production scheduling using computer simulation. Leu 
and Hwang (2001, 2002) and Chan and Hu (2002) minimized makespan using Genetic 
Algorithms (GAs). Benjaoran et al. (2005) optimized production schedules by considering 
multi-objectives using GAs. However, precast fabrication requires relatively spacious spaces 
while production. Previous studies ignore buffer sizes between stations resulting unrealistic 
production schedules. 
The objective of the study is to develop a Multi-objective Precast Production Scheduling 
Model (MPPSM). A limited buffer size between stations is taken into account in the model. 
Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) have been proven as one of sufficient methods in 
scheduling (Gao et al., 2000). By considering prefabricator’s objectives, a multi-objective GA is 
established to solve the model. The report firstly explains the process of precast production. The 
performance of proposed MPPSM is then validated by three experiments with five cases. Finally, 
conclusions induced from the experiments are documented. 
2. Review on Precast Production Scheduling 
Applying computational methods in recast production scheduling evolves from computer 
simulation to GA. Dawood and Neale proposed a precast scheduling model using simulation 
technique (Dawood and Neale 1993, Dawood 1993, Dawood 1995, Dawood 1996). The model is 
a computer-based capacity planning model for precast building products. The objective of the 
study is to help production managers make better planning decisions. The proposed model is 
regarded as a factory simulator that automates the process of planning using scheduling rules 
accordance with factory’s attributes before actual production commences.  
• Vern and Gunal (1998) also established a scheduling model using simulation techniques 
to facilitate analyses of complicated what-if scenarios in production schedule. The

specific dimension. In general, fabricators use steel mold for reuse purpose. Precast element 
primary contains two kinds of materials i.e. concrete and steel bars. Reinforcement and embedded 
parts are placed in their positions after the mold is formed. Embedded parts are used to connect 
and fix with other elements or with structure when precast elements are erected. Concrete is cast 
when embedded parts are in their positions. To enhance the chemistry solidifying concrete, curing 
concrete with steam is implemented. Otherwise, concrete takes weeks to reach its legal strength. 
Moving, erecting, or erecting elements before legal strength may damage elements. Molds can be 
striped after the concrete becomes solid. Due to the cost of developing steel molds, fabricators 
reuse them once they are stripped. The final step of production is to finish product. Minor defects 
such as scratch, peel-offs, uneven surfaces, etc. are treated in this step.

to 16 hours with non-workers needed. As such, the activity is frequently executed overnight. For 
the situation, the completion time is assumed on the beginning of next working day (see situation 
II of stream curing in Fig. 2). The third situation is a long-time curing which cannot be completed 
until next working day (see situation III of stream curing in Fig. 3). Completion time of jth 
element in curing is formulated by Eq. (8).

Fig. 2. Calculation of job completion. 
Steel mold is essential for precast fabrication. It means that jobs have to wait for their molds 
then fabrication can be started. When arranging production schedules, molds are assigned 
according to job sequence. Waiting time occurs when jobs wait for molds. For example, in Fig. 3, 
due to a limited number of mold A, fabrication of element 3 with mold A cannot be started until 
element 1 releases mold A. The example demonstrates a situation that fabrication waits for mold, 
which frequently happens in practice. A time that jth element waits for type $ mold is represented 
in Eq. (10).

where z represents objective vector, x is decision vector, and X denotes feasible area. To evaluate 
production schedule, multi-objectives are transferred to a single objective by a weighted sum 
approach. Single objective after transformation is shown in Eq. (14).

where 1 2,  ω ω  are positive weights ( 1 2 1ω ω+ = ), )(1 xf  is a makespan function shown in Eq. 
(11), and )(2 xf  is a penalty function shown in Eq. (12). While transforming, weights for 
individual objective can be determined by either fixed weights or random weights. To provide 
decision makers with flexible and diversified solutions, the study adopts random weights 
calculated using Eq. (15).

In multi-objective programming problems, since objective values distribute in different range, 
they are normalized before the weighted-sum operation. Cochran et al. (2003) proposed 
normalizing the objective value by the fittest one in the generation. Eq. (14) is then modified as 
Eq. (16).

5.2 Procedure of multi-objective genetic algorithm 
The research work proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm to search for optimum 
production schedules. The algorithm is developed based on the schema of Multi-Objective 
Genetic Local Search (MOGLS) proposed by Ishibuchi and Murata (1998). The evolutionary 
process of the developed multi-objective genetic algorithm is represented in Fig. 4. Details of the 
process are explained in Ko and Wang (2007ab).  
6. Experimentations 
The study validates the performance of proposed Multi-objective Precast Production 
Scheduling Model (MPPSM) through three experiments with five cases. A single objective is 
firstly examined. The drawback of considering single objective is discussed. However, in practice, 
precast fabricators may focus on only one objective for some circumstances, especially for 
emergency orders that require fastest production. Then, production scheduling with 
multi-objective is experimented. Pareto solution set acquired using the proposed model is 
compared with other methods. Finally, to validate buffer size between stations is crucial for 
obtaining reasonable schedules, buffer size and required buffer size are analyzed.

6.2 Multi-objective experiment 
The effectiveness of proposed model in single objective production scheduling has been 
proven in the previous section. This section discusses the promising of using MPPSM in precast 
production scheduling with multi-objectives. The experiment data shown in Table 3 are acquired 
from Benjaoran et al. (2005). For the case, prefabricator has two A molds, two B molds, and one 
C mold. The experiment includes 10 jobs, which provides 10! permutations. The 26 Pareto 
solutions have been discovered through the principle of exhaustion. 
To examine the performance of proposed model with other multi-objective methods, Vector 
Evaluated GAs (VEGA) (Schaffer, 1985) and Constant Weight GAs (CWGA) are compared. 
Parameters used for those three methods are summarized as follows: 
• Population size: 20 
• Termination condition: 200 iterations 
• Crossover rate: 0.9 
• Mutation rate: 0.005 
• Elite number: 4 
• Local search: 2 
Two weights for CWGA are 0.5 and 0.5. Experiment results shown in Table 4 are average of 20

Parameters used to experiment the expanded scheduling problem are explained as follows:  
• Population size: 70 
• Termination condition: 500 iterations 
• Crossover rate: 0.9 
• Mutation rate: 0.005 
• Elite number: 4 
• Local search: 2 
Experiment results for average of 20 runs are illustrated in Table 6. Observing the table, spread 
and spacing of CWGA are smaller than MPPSM’s. The reason is that CWGA searches for 
solutions along with a fixed direction, which results a smaller searching space. In addition, 
spreads of VEGA and MPPSM are similar whereas spacing of VEGA is larger than MPPSM’s. 
The primary reason the spacing of VEGA is larger than MPPSM’s is that the selection operation 
of VEGA depends on individual fitness of each objective. As a result, Pareto solution obtained by 
VEGA focuses only on one of objectives. According to experiment results and analysis addressed 
above, MPPSM excels VEGA and CWGA in achieving multi-objectives.

7. Conclusions 
The study has presented the development of Multi-objective Precast Production Scheduling 
Model (MPPSM). The model comprises of two stages. The first stage develops a mathematical 
precast production model. Production resources, mold type and amount, working hours, 
allowable overtime, and buffer size are taken into account in the mathematical model. In the 
second stage, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the mathematical model. 
Performance of the proposed MPPSM is validated using three experiments with five cases. 
Experiment results show that the developed scheduling model can fit with the requirement of 
precast fabrication, providing a set of Pareto optimum solution for assisting decision making.  
The research work pioneers considering buffer size between stations in precast production 
scheduling. Experiment results depict that both makespan and cost of penalty increases if buffer 
size is not sufficient to support required buffer size. On the contrary, buffer size has no impact on 
makespan and cost of penalty if buffer size is sufficient for required buffer size. The study proves 
that the capacity of buffer size is crucial for precast production scheduling. Previous methods in 
precast production scheduling ignores buffer size between stations may induce unfeasible 
solutions.

Fig 1: Precast Production Process 
 
Traditional flowshop sequencing problem regarded 
production as a continuous flow. However, precast 
production owns activities that can be done after working 
hours. Typical equation shown in Equation (1) that used to 
calculate completion time cannot meet the needs in the 
precast industry.  
 
( ) { }1 1, ax ( , ), ( , ) +j k j k j k jkC J M M C J M C J M P− −=      (1) 
 
Notations used in Equation (1) are explained as follows: 
( ),j kC J M : Completion time for jth element in k machine. 
 jkP : Operation time for jth element in k machine,  0jkP ≥ . 
 
Equation (1) assumes an infinite buffer size between 
stations. Due to the large size of precast elements, Equation 
(1) is reformulated as Equation (2). 
 
( ) { }1 1, 1, ax ( , ) , ( , ) +j k j k j k j k jkC J M M C J M WT C J M P− − −= +     (2) 
 
where 
1,j kWT −  is the time for (j-1)th element in k machine 
waiting to be sent to buffer.  
 
The Gantt chart of precast production is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
In the production, interruptible activities including mold 
assembly, placement of parts, mold stripping, and finishing 
can be done by the next day. Curing is categorized as 
uninterruptible activity that must be doing continuously 
until completion. Curing is a special task differing from 
other manufacturing. It is a time-consuming task and is 
frequently completed by machines without workers. As a 
result, it can be arranged in any time, even after the hours of 
working day. The other special requirement for curing is 
that it must be done right after casting i.e. no wait.  
 
Molds are necessary for precast fabrication. Number of 
molds is a crucial constrain for production scheduler. Due 
to the high cost of steel mold, fabricators only develop a 
few molds. As a result, makespan and throughput are 
harnessed by number of molds. For example, due to a 
limited number of mold A, element 3 with mold A cannot 
be started fabrication until element 1 releases mold A. The 
example demonstrates a situation that fabrication waits for 
mold, which frequently happens in practice. In the process 
of scheduling, sequence of molds is arranged according to 
the number of molds and types of molds.

3. MULTI-OBJECTIVE GENETIC ALGORITHM 
 
The study adopts the Multi-Objective Genetic Local Search 
Algorithm (MOGLS) proposed by Ishibuchi et al. [4] to 
search for optimum production schedules. The evolutionary 
process of MOGLS is represented in Fig. 3. Each step is 
discussed in the following sections. 
 
 
  
The mutation operator produces spontaneous random 
changes in various chromosomes. It protects against 
premature loss of important notations. The study uses shift 
mutation that randomly selects two points. The rear point 
inserts in advance of the prior point, then the whole gene 
shift back forward.  
 
3.9 Elitism 
 
Elitism has been proven successful in GA [7]. It survives a 
certain amount of Plato solution to the next generation. So 
every generation contains elite solutions for better 
evolvement. Applying the strategy, fitness increases 
generation by generation.  
 
3.10 Replace 
 
Replacement is a process that produced chromosomes 
eliminate parent chromosomes. In the process, previous 
population is renewed by generated offspring. Therefore, 
next generation can continuously involve new solutions for 
evolvement.  
 
3.11 Terminate Conditions 
 
Terminate conditions provide criterion for stopping 
evolutionary process. In general, evolutionary process is 
terminated by iterations and/or required fitness. 
 
4. EXPERIMENT 
 
The study experiments the efficiency of applying GA in 
precast production scheduling. Single objective GA, multi-
objective GA, and multi-objective GA with a finite buffer 
size are experimented. 
 
4.1 Single Objective GA 
 
The study firstly experiments the efficiency of applying 
single objective GA in precast production scheduling. 
Production data shown in tables 1 and 2 are acquired from 
Chan and Hu [8].

MOGLS can be applied to solve single objective problem. 
GA parameters for the problem are explained as follows: 
z Population size: 10 
z Termination condition: 1000 iterations 
z Crossover rate: 0.9 
z Mutation rate: 0.005 
z Elite number: 1 
z Local search: disable 
 
Since it is a small problem, local search is disabled. 
Experiment results are shown in Table 3. GA1 in the table 
denotes MOGLS with single objective “makespan” whereas 
GA2 represents MOGLS with single objective “cost of 
penalty.” Observing the table, the optimum schedule for 
single objective makespan, i.e. 4-5-2-6-1-3, is found by the 
algorithm. Optimum schedule (i.e. 4-2-3-1-6-5) with 
minimum cost of penalty 24.6 can be found by the 
algorithm too. The experiment validated that GA is 
promising to optimize precast production schedules.

4.2 Multi-Objective GA 
 
The effectiveness of single objective GA in precast 
production scheduling has been proven in the previous 
section. This section discusses the promising of using 
MOGLS with multi-objective in precast production 
scheduling. 
 
Production data experimented in this section are acquired 
from Benjaoran et al [3] (see tables 4 and 5). In this case, 
prefabricator has two A molds, two B molds, and one C 
mold. The experiment includes ten elements, which 
provides 10! combinations. To compare experiment results, 
26 Plato solutions have been discovered through the
