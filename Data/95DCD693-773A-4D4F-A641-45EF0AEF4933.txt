where USL and LSL are the upper and lower specification limits, respectively, μ  is 
the process mean, σ  is the process standard deviation, T  is the target value,  
( ) / 2d USL LSL= −  and ( ) / 2M USL LSL= +  are half-length and the midpoint of the 
specification interval [LSL, USL], respectively. Details about PCIs and their statistical 
properties can be found in these two monographs by Kotz and Johnson (1993) and 
Kotz and Lovelace (1998). A review paper by Kotz and Johnson (2002) provided a 
compact survey with interpretations and comments on some 170 publications on PCIs, 
which appeared during 1992-2000. Also, Spiring et al. (2003) provided a rather 
complete bibliography of process capability papers for the period 1990-2002. 
A process is said to have a symmetric tolerance if the target lies at the midpoint 
of the specification interval, i.e. T M= . Recent research and advances made in this 
subject are Chan et al. (1988), Boyles (1991), Spiring (1997), Pearn et al. (2004a, 
2004b, 2005) among many others. When this is not the case, there are serious 
disadvantages in the casual use of PCIs. The situation that the target value is not set to 
the midpoint of the tolerance range, i.e. T M≠ , sometimes called as asymmetric 
tolerances. Although processes with symmetric tolerances are common in practical 
situations, asymmetric tolerances cases can also often occur in the manufacturing 
industries. Recent research and advances made in this subject are Choi and Owen 
(1990), Boyles (1994), Vännman (1997), Chen (1998), Jessenberger and Weihs (2000) 
and the more recent Pearn et al. (2006a, 2006b), and references therein. 
Asymmetric tolerances reflect that deviations from the target are less tolerable in 
one direction than in the other based on the customer’s point of view (see Wu and 
Tang (1998)). In the literature, several authors including Boyles (1994) and Vännman 
(1997), have been devoted to handle processes with asymmetric tolerances for pmkC  
index and two generalizations of pmkC , including pmkS  and ( , )paC u v  have been 
proposed. However, pmkS  and ( , )paC u v  may understate or overstate the process 
capability in many cases, depending on the position of μ  relative to T . Pearn et al. 
(1999, 2001) introduced a capability index pmkC′′  to take into account the asymmetry 
of the specification limits. The results showed that pmkC′′  measures process capability 
more accurately than the original pmkC  index and other existing generalizations of 
pmkC  for processes with asymmetric tolerances.  
However, the sampling distribution of ˆ pmkC′′  is represented in an integral form 
 4
Since 2 (3 ) 1pkYield C≥ Φ −  (see Boyles (1991)) and pmk pmk pkC C C′′ ≤ ≤ , then 
given value of pmkC′′ , we can calculate a lower bound of process yield as 
2 (3 ) 1pmkC′′Φ − . For example, given a process with capability 1pmkC′′ = , the process 
yield is guaranteed to be no less than 2 (3) 1 99.73%Φ − = . On the other hand, the 
upper bound on the departure ratio can be calculated as */ /(3 )A d d Cd d≤ +  for 
pmkC C′′ ≥ . The result indicates that for large value of pmkC′′  the process departure is 
small. We note that the departure ratio, / ( ) / uA d T Dμ= −  if Tμ ≥ , and 
/ ( ) / lA d T Dμ= −  if Tμ < . 
2.2. Estimation of the ′′pmkC  Index 
To estimate the generalization pmkC′′ , Pearn et al. (1999) considered the natural 
estimator ˆ pmkC′′  defined in the following:

by replacing the process mean μ  and the process variance 2σ  by their 
conventional estimators x  and 2ns , which may be obtained from a stable process. If 
the manufacturing tolerance is symmetric, then *d d= , Aˆ *ˆ | |A x T= = − , and the 
estimator ˆ pmkC′′  reduces to 2 2 1/ 2ˆ ( | |) /{3[ ( ) ] }pmk nC d x M s x T= − − + − , the natural 
estimator of pmkC  considered by Pearn et al. (1992) for symmetric case. 
2.3. Sampling Distribution of the Estimated ′′pmkC  Index

Under the assumption of normality, K  is distributed as 2 1nχ −  a chi-square distribution 
with 1n −  degrees of freedom, and Z  is distributed as the normal distribution 
( ,1)N δ  with mean δ  and variance 1. Let ( )Φ ⋅  and ( )φ ⋅  be the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) and the probability density function (PDF) of the standard 
normal distribution (0,1)N , respectively. Then, the CDF and the PDF of Z  can be 
expressed as: ( ) ( )ZF z z δ= Φ −  and ( )Zf z = ( )zφ δ− . Hence, the CDF of Y  can 
be expressed as:

From Equation (10), changing the variable with ( )S x t y= , the CDF of ˆ pmkC′′

Therefore, given the asymmetric factors rd , ld  and ud , the sample size n , 
the -riskα , the capability requirement C  and the parameter ξ , a critical value 0c   
can be obtained using a numerical integration technique with iterations, to solve the 
Equation (16). Also, the power of the test can be computed as ( )pmkCπ ′′ =  
0
ˆ( | )pmk pmkP C c C′′ ′′> . In practice, the parameter ξ  contains unknown parameters μ  
and σ , it can be estimated by the sample data as ˆ ( ) / nx T sξ = − . We note, in 
particular, that Equation (16) is an even function of ξ , provided T = M  (symmetric 
tolerance). Thus for 0ξ ξ=  and 0ξ ξ= − , we may obtain the same critical value 
under symmetric tolerances. 
We can also calculate the -valuep  (the observed tail probability of the statistic 
ˆ
pmkC′′  being at least as extreme as the particular observed value when 0H  is true) 
satisfying *ˆ( | )pmk pmkP C c C C′′ ′′> = . Hence, for given the asymmetric factors rd , ld  
and ud , the sample size n , the parameter ξ , and the capability requirement C , a

its maximum at | |ξ = 0.5 in all cases and therefore, under l uD D= , we may solve 
Equation (16) with 0 .5ξ =  (or 0.5− ) to calculate 0c .

respectively (i.e., /l uD D = 3/1, 3/2, 1/1, respectively) with sample sizes n =10(5)200, 
C = 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00 and -riskα = 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 (the computer programs 
for generating these tables are available from the author). We note that for ( ld , ud ) = 
(a, b) and (b, a) (i.e., /l uD D = b/a and a/b), we have the same critical value. To 
determine if the process meets the capability (quality) requirement, we first determine 
C  and the -risk.α  Then we calculate the value of the estimator ˆ pmkC′′  from the 
sample data. From the appropriate table we find the critical value 0c  based on 
-risk,α  C  and sample size n . If the estimated value ˆ pmkC′′  is greater than the 
critical value 0c , then we conclude that the process meets the capability (quality) 
requirement. Otherwise, we do not have sufficient information to conclude that the 
process meets the present capability requirement. 
Procedure 
1. Determine the value of capability requirement C  (the desired quality condition), 
and the -riskα  (normally set to 0.01, 0.025 or 0.05), the probability of incorrectly 
accepting an incapable process (which does not meet the quality requirement) as 
a capable process (which meets the quality requirement). 
2. Calculate the value of the estimator ˆ pmkC′′  from the sample data. 
3. Check Tables 1-3 to find the corresponding 0c  based on C , α  and sample 
size n . 
4. Conclude that the process meets the capability requirement if the observed ˆ pmkC′′  
is greater than 0c . Otherwise, we do not have enough information to conclude 
that the process meets the capability requirement.  
5.2. Application to STI CMP Step Height Control 
A practice that is becoming increasingly common in industry is to require a 
supplier to demonstrate process capability as part of the contractual agreement. To 
demonstrate how we may apply the proposed method to the real-word applications, 
we use data provided by a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) supplier, 
which uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) to monitor their DRAM devices at the 
shallow trench isolation and trench capacitor levels in production. DRAM is one of 
the most important components of a memory module, and is the main system memory 
used in home and office personal computers. As with most manufactured products, it 
is essential the key components of those products are of high quality.  
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become an indispensable technology for 
monitoring trench depths and chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) processes on 
the production floor, especially at the front-end of the line, for the 90 nm node and 
below. Smaller critical dimensions and tighter planarity requirements limit the ability 
of traditional profilers to monitor the shallow trench isolation (STI) process in-die 
after CMP. The purpose of STI is to electrically isolate active device regions. The use 
of STI enables an active area with higher device density. After etch, STI features are

* * *ˆ max{ ( ) / , ( ) / }u lA d x T D d T x D= − − = 0.042 and ˆ pmkC′′ = 1.6052. 
Checking the value of critical value form Table 2 based on 1.33C = , -riskα = 
0.05 and n = 100, we obtain 0c = 1.557. Since the observed ˆ pmkC′′  is greater than the 
critical value 0c , we conclude that the process meets the preset capability 
requirement ( 1.33pmkC′′ > ) and runs under the desired quality condition. These product 
items conformed to the manufacturing specifications and are considered as reliable 
products. 
An alternative decision rule is stated as follows. After obtained the estimated 
statistics with the sample information, we obtain the corresponding p-value = 0.0125 
via Equation (17) by using computer software. That is, we would conclude that the 
process meets the capability requirement if the -riskα  is set to be larger than 0.0125. 
If the -riskα  is set to be smaller than 0.0125, we do not have sufficient information 
to conclude that whether the process meets the preset capability requirement. 
Accordingly, if we were using -riskα = 0.05, we would reject 0H  because 0.0125 < 
0.05.

Abstract: Process capability indices have been proved effective in providing measures 
on whether a process is capable of reproducing items meeting the quality/reliability 
requirement. At the present time, pkC  is the most widely used index for process 
performance assessment, but it may misinterpret process capability for asymmetric 
specification limits. This paper implements the theory of hypothesis testing to develop a 
decision making procedure for capability testing with asymmetric specification limits. 
The behavior of the critical values versus the unknown distribution parameter is 
investigated to obtain reliable critical values. Critical values are tabulated for various 
values of -risk,α  capability requirements and sample sizes to cover a widespread range 
of real world situation. The proposed procedure assists the practitioners to determine 
whether their process meets the preset capability requirement, and make reliable decisions. 
Finally, an application example on the trench capacitor etch process is presented for 
illustrating the applicability of the proposed procedure.  
Keywords: Asymmetric specification limits, Decision Making, Statistical hypothesis testing, 
Yield assurance. 
1. Introduction 
Process capability indices have popularly applied to the industry for providing 
numerical evaluation on process performance relative to a set of specification limits. 
Those indices are effective tools for both quality assurance and process capability 
analysis. Analyzing the process capability indices provide a means to trace and 
improve a poor process so the quality level can be enhanced. For thorough discussions 
of different capability indices and their statistical properties see, e.g., the two 
monographs by Kotz and Johnson (1993) and Kotz and Lovelace (1998), and the 
review paper with discussions by Kotz and Johnson (2002). Also, Spiring et al. (2003) 
provided a rather complete bibliography of process capability papers during the 
period 1990-2002. 
The original process capability index considered by Kane (1986) is pC , which is 
designed to provide an indirect measure of potential ability to meet requirements. The 
numerator of pC  gives the size of the range over process measurements can vary, 
and the denominator gives the size of the range over which the process is actually 
varying, reflecting product quality consistency. The pkC  index is developed to 
address the impact that shifting the process mean has on a process’s ability to produce 
product with specification. These two well-known capability indices in industry today 
have been defined respectively as (see Kane (1986)):

practical implementation. Also we develop a simple procedure for practitioners to use 
so that decisions made in assessing process capability are more reliable.  
2. Process Capability Index for Asymmetric Specification Limits 
2.1. The ′′pkC  Index 
Pearn and Chen (1998) proposed a generalization of pkC , called the pkC′′  index, 
for processes with asymmetric specification limits. The motivation for the new index 
pkC′′  is based on the general criteria stipulated by Boyles (1994) and Choi and Owen 
(1990) when analyzing and comparing the existing capability indices dealing with 
process yield, process centering, and other process characteristics. The generalization 
pkC′′  is defined formally as:  
,
3pk
d AC σ
∗ ∗−′′ =                            (2) 
where * * *max{ ( ) / ,  ( ) / }u lA d T D d T Dμ μ= − − , uD USL T= − , lD T LSL= − , *d   
min{ , }u lD D= . Observe that *( ) / ud T Dμ − = [ ]min{ , }( ) /( )u lD D T USL Tμ − −  and 
* ( ) / ld T Dμ− = [ ]min{ , }( ) /( )u lD D T T LSLμ− − . Obviously, if T M=  (symmetric 
specification limit), then * u ld d D D= = = , * | |A Mμ= −  and pkC′′  reduces to the 
original index pkC . We note that the index pkC′′  attains the maximal value at Tμ = , 
regardless of whether the preset specification limits are symmetric or not. 
For processes with asymmetric specification limits, the corresponding loss 
function is also asymmetric with respect to T . The pkC′′  index is designed to 
account for the asymmetry of the loss function. Thus, consider an asymmetric 
specification limit and given two processes E and F with E Tμ >  and F Tμ < , 
satisfying ( ) / ( ) /E u F lT D T Dμ μ− = −  (i.e., processes E and F have equal “departure 
ratios”), pkC′′  values given to these two processes are the same if E Fσ σ= . 
Evidently, if USLμ =  or LSL , the pkC′′  value becomes zero. Observe that the 
index pkC′′  decreases as the mean μ  shifts away from target T  in either direction. 
In fact pkC′′  decreases faster when μ  moves away from T  to the closer 
specification limit than to the further specification limit. This is an advantage since 
the index would respond faster to the shift towards “the wrong side” of T  as 
compared with the shifts towards the middle of the specification interval.  
2.2. Estimation of the ′′pkC  Index 
To estimate the index pkC′′ , Pearn and Chen (1998) proposed the following 
natural estimator:

3. Tests of Statistical Hypotheses about ′′pkC  
3.1. Equations to Calculate Critical Value and p-Value 
Statistical hypothesis testing is one of the principal areas of statistical inference. 
To test whether a given process is capable based on the pkC′′  index, we consider the 
following statistical testing hypotheses. The process meets the capability requirement 
if pkC C′′ > , and fails to meet the capability requirement if pkC C′′ ≤ : 
0H : pkC C′′ ≤  (incapable) versus 1H : pkC C′′ >  (capable). 
We define a test as the follows: The null hypothesis 0H  will be rejected if 0ˆ pkC c′′ >  
and the process will be considered capable, where 0c  is a constant called the critical 
value which can be determined so that the significance level of test is - risk,α  i.e., 
0
ˆ( | )pk pkP C c C C α′′ ′′> = = . The decision making rule will be: for given type I error α  
(the probability of wrongly reject null hypothesis when it is true) and sample size n , 
a process will be considered capable if 0ˆ pkC c′′ >  and incapable if 0ˆ pkC c′′ ≤ . 
Using the index pkC′′ , the engineers can access the process performance and 
monitor the manufacturing processes on a routine basis. By using the familiar 
designation ( ) /Tξ μ σ= −  and * /b d σ= , the index pkC′′  can be rewritten as: 
/ max{1, }

The numerical calculations can be easily carried out using the computer software, 
to integrate the function based on the chi-square distribution and the normal 
distribution. If the p-value is smaller than the -riskα , then we conclude that the 
process meets the capability requirement ( pkC C′′ > ). Otherwise, we do not have 
sufficient information to conclude that the process meets the present capability 
requirement. In this case, we would believe that the process is incapable ( pkC C′′ ≤ ).  
3.2. Critical Value 0c  and Parameter ξ  
In practice, since the process mean μ  and standard deviation σ  are unknown, 
then the parameter ξ  is also unknown and may need further estimation. It has been 
naturally done by substituting μ and σ with the sample mean x  and the sample 
standard deviation s . Such approach introduces additional sampling errors from 
estimating ξ  in finding the critical values, which certainly would make our 
decisions less reliable and provide less quality assurance to the customers. To 
eliminate the need for further estimating the distribution characteristic parameter ξ , 
we examine the behavior of the critical values 0c  against the parameter ξ .

4. Making Decisions 
4.1. Capability Requirements and Yield Assurance 
The pkC  index, sometimes called the yield-based index, has been widely used 
in the manufacturing industry and provides a measure of both process capability and 
yield assurance. Process yield has long been a standard criterion used in the 
manufacturing industry as a common measure on process performance. It is currently 
defined as the percentage of processes product units passing inspection. That is, the 
product characteristic must fall within the manufacturing tolerance. For product units 
rejected (non-conformities), additional costs would be incurred to the factory for 
scrapping or repairing the product. All passed product units are equally accepted by 
the producer, which incurs the factory no additional cost. From a practitioner’s point 
of view, it is most desirable that a given value received when estimating the capability 
of a process by using a process capability index, corresponds to that a certain part of 
the process output is non-conforming.  
Under the normality assumption, Boyles (1991) gave the upper and lower bounds 
on yield associated with pkC  as 2 (3 ) 1 yield (3 )pk pkC CΦ − ≤ ≤ Φ , where ( )xΦ  is 
the CDF of the standard normal distribution. Or equivalently, this relationship could 
be reinterpret in terms of non-conforming PPM (parts per million):  
6 610 ( 3 ) PPM 2 10 ( 3 )pk pkC C×Φ − ≤ ≤ × ×Φ − .              (15) 
To investigate the relationship between the capability indices and the process yield, 
Boyles (1994) considered the index pkS , a generalization of pkC , which is defined 
as: 
pkS  = 
11 1 1
3 2 2
USL LSLμ μ
σ σ
− ⎧ − − ⎫⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞Φ Φ + Φ⎨ ⎬⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎩ ⎭ .         (16) 
For normally distributed process, the index pkS  is a one-to-one transformation of 
fraction non-conforming. We note that given pkS c= , we can calculate the process 
yield as 2 (3 )cΦ – 1. Therefore, pkS  represents the actual process yield unlike pkC  
which is only approximately related to process yield. 
We consider the relationship between pkC′′  and pkS , and connect pkC′′  to a 
possible maximum non-conformities. Note that pkC′′  attains the maximal value at 
Tμ = , regardless of whether the preset specification limits are symmetric or not. 
Evidently, if Tμ = , then we have * 0A =  and pkC′′ = * /(3 )d σ . Therefore, if Tμ =  
and given pkC c′′ = , then we have * /(3 )d cσ = . Since both pkC′′  and pkS  are 
functions of ( , )μ σ , we may denote them by ( , )pkC μ σ′′  and ( , )pkS μ σ , 
respectively. Since *( , /(3 ))pk pkC S T d c′′ ≤  for all possible values of ( , )μ σ , we 
conclude that given a process with ( , )pkC μ σ′′ = c , the fraction non-conforming would 
be guaranteed to be less than that of a process with ( , )pkS μ σ = *( , /(3 ))pkS T d c . 
 30
4.2. Computation of the Critical Value  
Tables 2(a)-(d) tabulate critical values 0c  for /l uD D = 4/1, 4/2, 4/3 and 4/4 
respectively with sample sizes n = 10(5)200, ξ =−2.0(0.5)2.0 and 0.25± , C =1.00 
and -riskα = 0.05. For example, if /l uD D = 4/3, the capability requirement C = 1.00 
for 0.05α = , n = 150 and ξ = 1.5− , we check Table 2(c) to find that the critical 
values 0c = 1.112. To ensure the type I error to be no greater than α , we may set ξ = 
1 and /l uD D =1 in Equation (13) to calculate 0c  for testing process capability with 
both symmetric and asymmetric specification limits. We tabulate the critical values 
0c  in Table 3 for n = 10(5)200, C =1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, and -riskα = 0.01, 0.025 
and 0.05.  
The computer program (using Matlab) generating the tables is available from the 
authors. To determine if the process meets the capability (quality) requirement, we 
first determine C  and the -riskα . Then we calculate the value of the estimator ˆ pkC′′  
from the sample data. From the appropriate table we find the critical value 0c  based 
on -riskα , C  and sample size n . If the estimated value ˆ pkC′′  is greater than the 
critical value 0c , then we conclude that the process meets the capability (quality) 
requirement. Otherwise, we do not have sufficient information to conclude that the 
process meets the present capability requirement. 
Testing Procedure 
5. Determine the value of capability requirement C  (the desired quality condition), 
and the -riskα  (normally set to 0.01, 0.025 or 0.05), the probability of incorrectly 
accepting an incapable process (which does not meet the quality requirement) as 
a capable process (which meets the quality requirement). 
6. Calculate the value of the estimator ˆ pkC′′  from the sample data. 
7. Check Table 3 to find the corresponding 0c  based on C , α  and sample size 
n . 
8. Conclude that the process meets the capability requirement if the observed ˆ pkC′′  
is greater than 0c . Otherwise, we do not have enough information to conclude 
that the process meets the capability requirement.  
5. Application to Trench Capacitor Etch Processes 
5.1. The Trench Capacitor Etch Processes 
A practice that is becoming increasingly common in industry is to require a 
supplier to demonstrate process capability as part of the contractual agreement. To 
demonstrate how we may apply the proposed method to the real-word applications, 
we use data provided by a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) supplier, 
which uses atomic force microscopy (AFM) to monitor their DRAM devices at the 
shallow trench isolation and trench capacitor levels in production. DRAM is one of 
 32
distribution on key parameters, the higher the quality of the part and the lower is the 
probability that the end-customer will get a part that will not meet the published 
specification. The process capability index pkC′′  is used to monitor the trench 
capacitor etch process capability.  
5.2. Manufacturing Capability Computations and Data Analysis 
Suppose a customer has told the vendor that, in order to qualify for business with 
his company, the vendor must demonstrate that his process capability pkC′′  is no less 
than C , say 1.33. One may set a test with the null hypothesis 1.33pkC′′ ≤  (the 
process is incapable) and the alternative hypothesis 1.33pkC′′ >  (the process is 
capable). The decision making rule will be: for given values of the -riskα  and the 
sample size n , the process will be declared capable if 0ˆ pkC c′′ >  and incapable 
otherwise. The recess depth is an essential critical characteristic, which has significant 
impact to product quality. Specification limits for the recess depth are set to USL = 
36.0nm, LSL = 22.0nm and T = 30.0nm. Asymmetric specification limits reflect that 
deviations from the target are less tolerable in one direction than in the other.

The collected sample data of size 100 are displayed in Table 4. Historical data 
based on routine process monitoring shows that the process is under statistical control. 
The validity of the normality also has been verified by using the Shapiro and Wilk 
(1965) W test. In this illustrative example, we have:

Checking the critical value from Table 3 based on 1.33C = , -riskα = 0.05 and n 
=100, we obtain 0c = 1.517. Since the observed ˆ pkC′′  is greater than the critical value 
0c , we conclude that the process meets the preset capability requirement ( ˆ 1.33pkC′′ > ) 
and runs under the desired quality condition. These product items conformed to the

並且被視為品質改善活動的基本工具之一。當我們處理計量型資料，我們通常
會使用 X  管制圖和 R (或 S) 管制圖的組合來同時監控製程中心位置與變異程
度。這些管制圖很容易瞭解，並且能在不需使用任何文字或公式的情況下，有
效率地傳達製程產出績效的關鍵資訊。I 在本計畫中，我們介紹非對稱允差規格
多製程績效分析圖，使用非對稱製程能力指標 pkC′′  和 pmC′′  來同時管制多個製
程的產出品質。 在非對稱製程能力指標 pkC′′  和 pmC′′ 多製程績效分析圖中，我
們使用 pkC′′  和 pmC′′  的信賴區間下界來表示製程產出真實績效的最差狀況，來
保障產品的品質。 pkC′′  和 pmC′′ 多製程績效分析圖可以將多個製程的產出狀況描
繪在單一分析圖上，用來同時提供多個製程管制上關鍵的訊息。我們將說明將
信賴區間下界繪製在 pkC′′  和 pmC′′ 多製程績效分析圖的步驟與方法，並以實務的
例子來說明我們所提方法的適用性以及優越之處。我們所提出的決策法則將可
以協助工程師用來評估多個製程產出績效，並可以作出製程產出是否符合預設
的製程能力需求，同時在品質改善的對象與方向也將提供明確的資訊。
