heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) 
are of great interest for microwave and digital 
circuit applications [1-3]. For achieving high 
power and good stability, the improvement of 
breakdown characteristics between gate and 
drain is a necessary condition. Unfortunately, 
the formation of surface or interface states and 
pinning effect of Fermi level are known to 
affect the device performance [4]. To avoid the 
undesired phenomena and further improve 
electrical properties of compound 
semiconductors, the surface chemical treatment 
with inorganic sulfides has received much 
attention. Even though a number of sulfur 
compounds such as Na2S, (NH4)2S, and 
(NH4)2Sx have been used [4,5-7], only 
(NH4)2Sx treatment shows promising results. 
This is because of its ability to etch the native 
oxide and tie up the dangling bonds with sulfur 
on the Ш-V semiconductor surfaces [6]. This 
implies that the semiconductor surfaces with 
(NH4)2Sx treatment can reduce surface state 
density, form a well-ordered electrically 
passivated surface, and improve device 
characteristics [8-9]. 
For metal-semiconductor field-effect 
transistors (MESFETs), the Schottky barrier 
height plays a crucial role in the device 
operation. It is of great concern whether the 
metal/semiconductor contact can form a 
desirable Schottky contact. In addition, for the 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pseudomorphic high 
electron mobility transistor (PHEMT), the 
oxidation of AlGaAs layer degrades the device 
characteristics [10]. This leads to the degraded 
performances including low gain, low 
efficiency, and low output power [11]. Clearly, 
it is important to passivate the AlGaAs surface 
to improve the device performance. In this 
work, we report a surface passivation study 
using (NH4)2Sx solution on an 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs PHEMT. It is found 
that the sulfur passivation can remove the 
native oxide and enhance the dependence of the 
Schottky barrier height on the metal work 
function [4,6,8]. Furthermore, the 
sulfur-passivated PHEMT shows better 
temperature operation capability and relatively 
temperature-insensitive behaviors. 
 
四、研究方法 
The schematic cross section of the studied 
devices is depicted in Fig. 1. The epitaxial 
structure was grown on a (100)-oriented 
semi-insulating (S.I.) GaAs substrate by a 
low-pressure metal organic chemical vapor 
deposition (LP-MOCVD) system. The epitaxial 
layers consisted of a 4000Å GaAs buffer layer, 
a 200Å AlAs buffer layer, a 50Å Al0.25Ga0.75As 
space layer, a delta-doped sheet δ2(n+) = 
1×1012cm-2, a 50Å Al0.25Ga0.75As space layer, a 
150Å In0.15Ga0.85As channel layer, a 50Å 
Al0.25Ga0.75As space layer, a delta-doped sheet 
δ1(n+) = 4×1012cm-2, a 400Å n-Al0.25Ga0.75As (n 
= 3×1017cm-3) Schottky barrier layer, a 300Å 
n-GaAs (n = 3×1017cm-3) space layer, and a 
500Å n+-GaAs (n+ ≧ 3×1018cm-3) cap layer. 
The space layer inserted between barrier and 
cap layer was used to prevent dopants of cap 
layer diffusing into the barrier layer. After 
epitaxial growth, the studied device A was 
processed by standard photolithography, 
conventional vacuum evaporation, lift-off, and 
sulfur passivation. Mesa isolation processes 
were achieved by wet chemically etching. 
Drain and source Ohmic contacts were formed 
on the n+-GaAs cap layer by alloying 
evaporated AuGe/Ni/Au metals at 430℃ for 3 
minutes. After forming drain and source Ohmic 
contacts, the solution of H3PO4:H2O2:H2O = 
1:1:50 was used to remove the n+-GaAs cap 
and n-GaAs space layer. Then, the (NH4)2Sx 
solution was used to reduce the surface Fermi 
level pinning effect by decreasing the interface 
trap state density [8]. The surface passivation 
was carrier out by the following procedure. The 
samples were soaked in the ammonia-sulfide 
solution ((NH4)2Sx, 5%) for 10 minutes at room 
temperature and then rinsed in deionized (DI) 
water, followed by blown dry N2 gas. Finally, 
the gate Schottky contact was achieved by 
 4
different temperature are shown in Fig. 3. The 
inset shows Von and IG of device A and device 
B (without sulfur treatment) as a function of 
temperature. For device A (B), the Von is 
decreased from 0.994 (0.936) to 0.69 (0.598) V 
as the temperature is increased from 300 to 
510K. The corresponding IG is increased from 
0.6 (7) to 571 (1830) μA/mm. As the 
temperature is increased, the reduced Von and 
increased IG are attributed to the reduction of 
energy gap and tunneling mechanism with 
thermionic emission. On the other hand, the 
gate-drain breakdown voltage (BVGD), defined 
at IG = -0.5 mA/mm, is decreased from 36.4 
(32.4) to 21.5 (16.9) V for device A (B) once 
the temperature is increased from 300 to 510K. 
It is known that the breakdown voltage is a 
function of Schottky barrier height and surface 
leakage current. Obviously, upon the (NH4)2Sx 
treatment, the breakdown characteristics are 
greatly improved. For instance, the IG (BVGD) 
is decreased (increased) from 7 μA/mm (32.4 V) 
of device B to 0.6 μA/mm (36.4 V) of device A 
at room temperature. Note that the IG of device 
A is found to be about one order in magnitude 
lower than that of device B. The decrease of IG 
and increase of BVGD are mainly attributed to 
the reduction of surface recombination centers 
density and surface leakage current [18-20]. In 
addition, the studied device A still maintains 
high Von and low IG values at higher 
temperature regimes. The related temperature 
coefficients, i.e., 
T
Von
∂
∂  and 
T
IG
∂
∂
, of device A 
are only of -1.45 mV/K and 2.72 μA/mm·K, 
respectively, as the temperature is increased 
from 300 to 510K. This indicates that the sulfur 
passivation can offer an effective suppression 
of leakage current over wide temperature range. 
This is caused by the substantial reduction of 
thermally generated interface defects by the 
(NH4)2Sx treatment [8,16]. Thus, for device A, 
the sulfur passivation of AlGaAs surface before 
metal evaporation can improve the thermal 
stability of metal/AlGaAs Schottky contact. 
Figure 4 shows the Schottky barrier height 
(ΦB) and ideality factor (n), determined by the 
gate-drain I-V characteristics, as a function of 
temperature. The inset shows forward 
logarithmic IG versus VGD at 300 and 510K. For 
device A (B), the ΦB is decreased slightly from 
0.945 (0.874) to 0.925 (0.847) eV as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 510K. 
The corresponding n is increased from 1.28 
(1.39) to 1.41 (1.55). The deviations of ΦB and 
n are 2.1 (3.1) % and 10.1 (11.5) % of device A 
(B) as the temperature is increased from 300 to 
510K. Obviously, device A demonstrates lower 
degradation rates with temperature. The ΦB 
values of the Pt- and Au-AlGaAs gate Schottky 
contact with and without sulfur passivation are 
listed in Table I. The interface state density (Ds) 
can be estimated as [21]: 
32 cc mB +Φ=Φ                   (1) 
and 
2
213 )1(101.1
c
cDs
−×=              (2) 
where Φm is the metal work function and 
c2 and c3 the constants. From the data in Table I, 
the Ds of device A (B) is calculated as 3.5×1013 
(7.7×1013) cm-2eV-1. The Ds value of device A 
is reduced by a factor of 2 than that of device B. 
This enhances the dependence of ΦB on Φm. 
Hence, the deposition of Pt/Au on the 
sulfur-passivated AlGaAs surface moves the 
Fermi level within the band gap toward the 
band bending direction [8,15,22]. This implies 
that the relatively higher Von of device A can be 
obtained. As a result, the sulfur-passivated 
device allows a large induced current in the 
channel which can enhance the output power 
capability. 
 
C. HEMT performance 
Figure 5 shows typical common-source 
I-V characteristics of the studied devices at 
different temperature. The applied gate-source 
voltage is VGS = -0.5 V/step. The studied 
device A shows better pinch-off and saturation 
characteristics under various temperature. This 
is caused by the excellent Schottky behaviors 
 6
device A (B) at 300 and 510K, respectively. 
These broad IDS operating regimes of device A 
(B) are higher than 62 (62) % and 55 (45) % of 
the maximum output current at 300 and 510K, 
respectively. Apparently, the device A shows 
better linearity in transconductance behaviors 
than device B. In addition, the device A shows 
low degradation rate in IDS operating regimes 
(
TI
I
∂
∂ 1 ), i.e., -1.45×10-3/K, as the temperature 
is increased from 300 to 510K. Thus, the 
studied device with (NH4)2Sx treatment is 
certainly suitable for high-temperature 
applications. 
The temperature dependences of gm, 
output conductance (gds), and voltage gain (AV) 
are depicted in Fig. 9. The biased voltages are 
fixed at VDS = 3.5 (3.5) V and VGS = -0.5 (-1.0) 
V for device A (B). The gds is increased slightly 
from 0.51 (0.54) to 0.53 (0.56) mS/mm for 
device A (B) as the temperature is increased 
from 300 to 510K. The corresponding gm is 
decreased from 238 (174) to 211 (154) mS/mm. 
Thus, the corresponding AV (gm/gds) is 
decreased from 465 (323) to 397 (275) for 
device A (B). Clearly, due to the improved gate 
Schottky and breakdown characteristics, the 
relatively lower gds and higher gm of device A 
are obtained. This indicates that the sulfur 
passivation on AlGaAs surface can effectively 
suppress the perimeter and intrinsic leakage 
currents caused by the surface recombination 
centers. Furthermore, it is found that the device 
A still maintains high AV at 510K and the 
decrease of AV is only 14.6 % once the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 510K. 
Therefore, good amplification performances of 
the sulfur-passivated device can be achieved 
even at higher temperature. 
 
D. Microwave characteristics 
Figure 10 shows the dependences of unity 
current gain cut-off frequency (fT) and 
maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) on the 
IDS at different temperature. The inset reveals fT 
and fmax as a function of temperature for device 
A and B. Under the bias condition of VGS = -0.5 
(-1.0) V and VDS = 3.5 (3.5) V, the fT of device 
A (B) is decreased from 22.2 (18.1) to 19.5 
(14.7) GHz as the temperature is increased 
from 250 to 400K. The corresponding fmax is 
decreased from 87.9 (72.6) to 59.3 (53.0) GHz. 
Generally, the fT and fmax can be expressed as 
[24]:

≈                   (7) 
where CP is the parasitic capacitance and Ri the 
series resistance. From Eq. (5), it is known that 
the gm is directly proportional to Ci. However, 
upon the (NH4)2Sx treatment, the surface bound 
charges and the corresponding capacitance are 
reduced [15,18,20]. Hence, due to the lower CP 
and gds, the fT and fmax values of device A are 
higher than those of device B at 250 ~ 400K. 
The enhancements of fT and fmax at low 
temperature (250K) and low degradations of fT 
and fmax at high temperature (400K) further 
indicate the promise of device A for 
high-performance microwave applications [25]. 
Moreover, the studied device A (B) maintains 
80% of its fT and fmax peak values over large IDS 
operating regimes of 475 (320), 470 (305), and 
455 (300) mA/mm at 300, 350, and 400K, 
respectively. All profiles of device A display 
the plateau distributions broader than those of 
device B. Especially, the IDS degradation rate 
with temperature (
TI
I
∂
∂ 1 ), from 300 to 400K, 
of device A is only of -4.21×10-4/K. This value 
is lower than that of device B (-6.25×10-4/K) 
and is relatively insignificant. Therefore, based 
on the better linearity and thermal stability in
