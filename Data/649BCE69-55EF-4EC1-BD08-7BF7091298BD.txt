power boost (DPB), to reduce the PAPR of an OFDM system. We deliberately boost the amplitude
of a time-domain OFDM signal by a constant amount. Although both the average power and peak
power are increased by using DPB, we show that the PAPR can be reduced by the proposed method.
The PAPR can be further reduced by combining DPB with other PAPR-reduction techniques such
as RCF.
We also propose another redundance-based scheme that uses the tail-biting bits of a tail-biting
turbo code [19] to generate multiple candidates used in SLM. The multiple codewords start from and
end in the same state for the same message can be used as multiple candidates in SLM. The cross
correlations among these turbo codewords are small since the recursive encoders of the constituent
codes and the interleaver are used as scramblers. With such generation of candidates, we can
implement SLM without explicit SI and decode the turbo code by using the tail-biting decoder
proposed in [20]. Unlike the SLM techniques proposed in [17][18], the proposed method does not
increase the complexity of receiver. As compared to the SLM technique proposed in [15], the
proposed method can achieve better error performance since the error propagation observed in [15]
does not occur in the proposed method.
The tail-biting turbo coded (TC) OFDM system which uses both RCF and DPB to reduce the
PAPR and uses the concept of SLM to mitigate the error degradation is also constructed, although
SLM is originally proposed for PAPR reduction. The transmitter is implemented by first using the
tail-biting bits in a tail-biting turbo code to generate multiple candidates and then predicting the
distortion power for each candidate. Finally, we apply RCF and DPB to the candidate with the
minimum predicted distortion power. The error performance of such a TCOFDM system can be
further improved by iteratively estimating and cancelling the distortion caused by RCF and DPB
at the receiver. Such a tail-biting TCOFDM system can achieve both low PAPR and low BER.
As compared to tail-biting TCOFDM systems using only RCF, tail-biting TCOFDM systems using
both RCF and DPB can achieve similar BER and better PAPR.
The error propagation of the PTS scheme is also alleviated by the two proposed methods for
multiple-candidate separation through turbo decoding. The first method is based on few pilot tones
for SI and hence is a semi-blind method. The other is a blind method which does not require any
pilot tone. In the blind method, all possible candidates are decoded by the turbo decoder using
one or two iterations to find the most probable transmitted candidate. The proposed methods can
be applied to both the phase-rotation-based PTS scheme [21][22] and the cyclical-shift-based PTS
scheme [23]. In addition, the blind method can achieve similar error performance compared to using
the perfect side information.
However, for the PTS-based system, the search complexity is increased when the number of can-
didates is increased. The PTS-based system becomes less practical when the number of candidates is
large. Hence, we further propose an iterative trellis-based factor search (ITFS) algorithm to reduce
the search complexity for the PTS-based OFDM system. On the other hand, a phase-quantization-
based demapper is used to avoid transmitting the side information, and another blind receiver with
lower receiving algorithm is proposed. The overall system is shown to achieve a lower complexity
and a comparable PAPR/BER performance comparing to the multiple-candidate separation system
using the blind and semi-blind methods.
In this report, the distortion-based DPB is introduced in Chapter II. We describe a tail-biting
SLM scheme using the proposed method of candidates generation in Chapter III. In Chapter IV,
we present the proposed method of candidates separation by turbo decoding. In Chapter V, we
described the proposed ITFS algorithm and the phase-quantization-based receiver. The extension
to MIMO-OFDM system is also drawn in Chapter V. Chapter VI concludes this report.

k=0
Xke
jk2pi∆ft, 0 ≤ t ≤ T (2.1)
where T is the symbol interval, and ∆f = 1/T is the frequency spacing between adjacent subcarriers.
The peak power of s(t) may be significantly greater than the average power of the transmitted OFDM
symbols. This effect can be measured by the PAPR of s(t) defined by
PAPR(s(t)) =
max0≤t≤T | s(t) |2
1
T E{
∫ T
o
s(t)s∗(t)dt}
(2.2)
where the expectation E{·} is taken over all the possible transmitted OFDM symbols s(t). Signal
s(t) is processed by a non-linear PA with a maximum permissible amplitude P and a clipping ratio
γP =
P√
E[‖s(t)‖2] to obtain the output signal s˜(t). Signal s(t) with high PAPR will result in the
signal s˜(t) with high out-of-band emission and high in-band distortion.
The PAPR of s(t) is usually measured by its discrete-time version PAPR(x), where x =
(x0, x1, · · · , xN−1) is the time-domain signal of X. Let iM be the index such that
|xiM |2 = max
0≤i≤N−1
|xi|2. (2.3)
Like [25], we assume that the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of time-domain signal xi,
i = 0, 1, · · · , N−1, follow the Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ2. The amplitude
|xi| is a Rayleigh random variable with E{|xi|} =
√
pi/2σ and E{|xi|2} = 2σ2 for i = 0, 1, · · · , N−1.
Then, we have
PAPR(x) =
|xiM |2
1
NE{ΣN−1i=0 |xi|2}
=
|xiM |2
2σ2
. (2.4)
The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for PAPR(x) is the probability
Pr{PAPR(x) > λ}, where λ is a positive constant. If N is large enough, Pr{PAPR(x) > λ}
can be approximated well by
Pr{PAPR(x) > λ} = Pr{ |xiM |
2
2σ2
> λ} ≈ 1− (1− e−λ)aN (2.5)
where a = 1.0 [25]. We can use over-sampled IFFT to get an improved estimation of PAPR(s(t)).
In this case, a in (2.5) becomes 2.8 [25].
2.3 OFDM Systems Using Deliberate Power Boost
We can insert a module of DPB (deliberate power boost) between the modules of N -point IFFT and
D/A converter. For 0 ≤ i ≤ N−1, let xi ≡ |xi|ejθi and x′i denote the input and output signals of the
DPB module, respectively. The operation of DPB with parameter AP > 0 can be done according to
x′i = (|xi|+AP )ejθi (2.6)
for 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. In this paper, the value of AP is given based on 1NE{ΣN−1i=0 |xi|2} = 1.

. Based on equation (2.5), we can plot the CCDF of PAPR(x). With equations (2.5),
(2.8) and (2.10), we can plot the CCDF of PAPR(x′). Both theoretical and simulation curves of
CCDF of PAPR(x′) with Ac = 1.0895, Ap = 0.1, and σ2 = 0.5 and PAPR(x) are shown in Fig. 2.2.
From curves A1 and B1 in Fig. 2.2, we find that better distribution of PAPR can be achieved by
using DPB as compared to the case of not using DPB (original case).

2.3.2 Analysis of PAPR: Clipped Case
Now we consider the PAPR distribution of OFDM systems using DPB for the clipped case. Delib-
erate clipping [24] is a PAPR-reduction method which directly suppresses the time-domain signals
when the amplitude of input signal exceeds a certain threshold Tth. We can combine DPB with
deliberate clipping for further PAPR reduction. In this case, the clipper is inserted between the
modules of DPB and D/A converter. Deliberate clipping is usually implemented by a digital clipper
which is described as follows. For 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1, let x′i ≡ |x′i|ejθ
′
i be the input signal of a digital
clipper and γ = Tth√
Pin
be the clipping ratio, where Pin is the input power of the clipper.
For an OFDM system using DPB, we have Pin = P
′
av = A
2
c . Since the clipper produces the
output signal with an average power lower than that of the input signal, we must consider this effect
in the calculation of PAPR(x¯), where x¯ = (x¯0, . . . , x¯N−1) is the output signal of the clipper which
is given by
x¯i = g(|x′i|) =
{
x′i, |x′i| ≤ Tth

(2.18)
The total output signal power S is
S = α2E[|xi|2] = KγP ′out (2.19)
where Kγ is the attenuation factor which is given by
Kγ =
S
P ′out
=
α2E[|xi|2]
P ′out
. (2.20)
Since the Nyquist-rate clipping is used here, all the clipping noise is in-band. Since all the
distortion falls within the signal bandwidth, the total distortion power D = P ′out−S. Consequently,
the SNDR of x¯i, i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , N − 1, is
SNDR =

P ′out −KγP ′out +Np
=
KγEs/N0
(1−Kγ)Es/N0 + 1
(2.21)
where Np is the power of additive noise and Es/N0 is the ratio of the OFDM symbol energy after
power boost and clipping to the noise power spectral density. The BER Pb of 16QAM after deliberate
power boost and clipping can be expressed as
Pb =
1
log2M
{1− 1
M
[(
√
M − 2)2p(c|I)
+ 4(
√
M − 2)p(c|II) + 4p(c|III)]}
(2.22)
where p(c|I) = [1 − Q(√(3/(M − 1))SNDR)]2, p(c|II) = [1 − 2Q(√(3/(M − 1))SNDR)][1 −
Q(
√
(3/(M − 1))SNDR)], p(c|III) = [1− 2Q(√(3/(M − 1))SNDR)]2 and M = 16.
If Kγ = 1 (γ = ∞) is used in (2.21), we can obtain the theoretical BER results for un-clipped
OFDM systems using 16QAM from (2.22). Both simulation and theoretical results of BER for
either clipped or un-clipped OFDM systems are given in Fig. 2.3. From curves A1, B1, A2, and B2
in Fig. 2.3, either clipped or un-clipped OFDM systems using DPB achieve a slightly worse error
performance as compared to the case of not using DPB.
2.4 Applications of RCF to TCOFDM Systems Using DPB
For deliberate clipping, its high in-band distortion and out-of-band emission can be reduced by
over-sampled digital clipping [26] and by digital filters, respectively. This procedure is called over-
sampled clipping and filtering (OCF). However, if the out-of-band emission is filtered off, it is likely
that the reduced PAPR of the clipped signal will regrow [3]. We can achieve improved PAPR by
repeating (or recursive) clipping and filtering (RCF) several times [4].
13
Step 2 For 0 ≤ i ≤ LN−1, let xi ≡ |xi|ejθi and x′i respectively denote the input and output signals
of the DPB module. The DPB with parameter AP > 0 can be done according to equation
(2.24).
x′i = (|xi|+AP )ejθi (2.24)
for 0 ≤ i ≤ LN − 1.
Step 3 According to (2.23), perform digital clipping with a clipping ratio γ = Tth√
E[‖x′‖2] on x
′ =
(x′0, x
′
1, · · · , x′LN−1) to obtain x¯ = (x¯0, x¯1, · · · , x¯LN−1).
Step 4 Apply LN -point FFT on x¯ to get the frequency-domain signal X¯=(X¯0, X¯1, · · · , X¯LN−1).
Step 5 Filter out the out-of-band emission of X¯ by setting X¯i = 0 for i ∈ {N, · · · , LN − 1} to get
X˜.
Step 6 Repeat Step 1 to Step 5 NIT times.
If AP equals zero, then RCF-DPB reduces to RCF.

2.5 Simulation Results
We consider an OFDM system with 128-tone OFDM modulators (N = 128), and 16-QAM con-
stellations with Gray labelling. A rate-1/2 turbo code with generator matrix (1, 15/13)8 is used
in coded OFDM systems. Seven iterations are used in the turbo decoding. In our simulation,
L = L1 = L2 = 2, Q = 8, and NIT = 3.

have been applied to OFDM systems using RCF and DPB for improved error performance. We have
showed that turbo coded OFDM systems using RCF-DPB can achieve better PAPR performance
without degrading the error performance as compared to the case of using RCF.
17
But more iteration of clipping and filtering would also increase the clipped distortion and cause error
degradation. In this project, we use the proposed SLM to reduced the in-band distortion resulted
from RCF and preserve its PAPR gain. With these proposed techniques, a tail-biting TCOFDM
system can achieve both low PAPR and low BER.
3.2 System Description and Basic Definitions
The block diagram of a turbo coded OFDM transmitter with PAPR reduction module is similar as
in Fig. 2.1. An N -tone OFDM transmitter with turbo encoding, interleaving, and signal mapping,
we can convert a message vector u¯ into complex vectors X = (X0, X1, · · · , XN−1), where Xk is the
complex value carried by the kth subcarrier of the N−tone OFDM symbols coded by a turbo code-
word. One OFDM symbol s(t) at the output of the digital-to-analog (D/A) converter is represented
by (2.1) and the definition of PAPR of s(t) also could be found in (4.1). Signal s(t) ≡ |s(t)|ejθ(t)
is processed by a non-linear PA with a maximum permissible amplitude P and a clipping ratio
γP =
P√
E[‖s(t)‖2]
to obtain the output signal s˜(t) according to
s˜(t) =
{
s(t), |s(t)| ≤ P
Pejθ(t), |s(t)| > P. (3.1)
Signal s(t) with high PAPR will results in the signal s˜(t) with high out-of-band emission and high
in-band distortion.
The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for PAPR is the probability of
OFDM symbols with PAPR exceeding some threshold λ, which can be expressed as (3.2) under the
assumption that the real and imaginary parts of the complex modulated signal can be approximated
by uncorrelated Gaussian random variables as N is large enough,
P (PAPR > λ) = 1− (1− e−λ)N . (3.2)
If oversampling is considered, a better approximation of CCDF for PAPR is given in [25] as
P (PAPR > λ) = 1− (1− e−λ)αN . (3.3)
where α = 2.8.
3.3 Selective-Mapping for PAPR Reduction
3.3.1 Basic Concept
The SLM [10] technique for reducing PAPR is operated as follows. Each message to be transmitted
is assigned with Q possible OFDM symbols for transmission, where each OFDM symbol is called a
candidate. The transmitter selects the candidate with the smallest PAPR for transmission. In order
to recover the transmitted message, the receiver requires the knowledge about which candidate is
selected at the transmitter. We may add the ⌈log2Q⌉-bit side information in the transmitted symbol
so that the receiver can recover the side information and hence the associated candidate. Under

3.4 Selective-Mapping Tail-biting Turbo Coded OFDM Schemes
without Explicit Side Information
We can avoid the error propagation occurring in the conventional method and hence improve the
error performance by using the proposed method of candidate generation. The multiple candidates
are generated by using a tail-biting turbo code. A tail-biting turbo code is the same as that of
conventional turbo codes except that the first constituent code, RSC1, or/and the second constituent
code, RSC2, is encoded in a tail-biting form. The codeword of a tail-biting code starts from and
ends in the same state. Now consider the encoding and decoding for RSC1 or RSC2.
3.4.1 Encoding and Decoding for Recursive Systematic Convolutional
Codes
For a rate k/n recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code, we can use the procedure in [19] to
encode a message vector u¯ = {u0,u1, · · · ,uM−1} with Mk bits in a tail-biting form, where un,
0 ≤ n ≤ (M − 1), is a binary k × 1 vector at time n. Let m be the number of memory bits in this
21
for candidates generation in a way similar to RSC1. Let m2 denote the number of memory bits in
RSC1. Then we can have a total candidate number of Q = 2m1+m2+c with low cross-correlation. In
a conventional SLM with Q candidates, ⌈log2Q⌉ bits called side information (SI) are needed to tell
the receiver which candidate is used in the transmitter. In general, SI should be protected by error
correcting codes since erroneous decision of SI will result in serious error performance degradation.
The bandwidth efficiency is reduced for the transmission of this SI. With the proposed methods
of candidates generation, no explicit SI is needed. As compared to the method proposed in [15],
our method has a better error performance since no error propagation is observed. The transmitter
structure is shown in Fig. 3.2.

3.4.3 Performance Evaluation for Tail-biting SLM Turbo Coded OFDM
Schemes
Now consider the PAPR and BER performance of our method. An 128-tone OFDM modulator,
16-QAM constellations with Gray mapping, a rate R=1/2 turbo code with seven iterations and
generator matrix (1, 15/13)8 are used. The tailbiting form of RSC1 is used. The oversampling factor
of L2=4 is used to choose the candidate with minimum PAPR. Because the number of memory bits
of RSC1 is 3, the candidate number is 8. We can increase the candidate number to be 32 and 256
by using 2 and 5 for c, respectively. Fig. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4 respectively show the PAPR distribution
and BER of turbo coded OFDM system using the proposed method of candidates generation. Also
included in Fig. 3.3 and Fig. 3.4 are the PAPR and BER performance of Scheme I. We can have
similar PAPR performance and better BER performance by using the proposed method as compared
to Scheme I.

Step 3 Apply RCF/RCF-DPB with an over-sampling factor of L2 on the candidate X with the
minimum D among these Q candidates to obtain the desired transmitted signal.
In Combination III, Q L′N -point IFFT operations and 2NIT L2N -point (I)FFT operations are
needed in the parts of SLM and RCF, respectively.

In [25], the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of xi, at the output of N

are assumed to approach the Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ2 , and hence

assumption, in Combination III, di, i = 0, 1, · · · , L′N−1, defined in equation (3.7), are uncorrelated

ii. CCDF for distortion power in SLM
The reason that SLM can alleviate the BER degeneration resulted from RCF is described as follows.
Fig. 3.6 shows the CCDF of distortion power D by using simulation and equations (3.9) and (3.10),
where we have normalized the average power of Xi, 0 ≤ i ≤ N−1 to be 1. The variance of D used in
(3.9) is calculated by assuming that di, i = 0, 1, · · · , L′N − 1, are uncorrelated. However, in reality,
there exits some correlations among di, i = 0, 1, · · · , L′N − 1. For the theoretical curves shown in
Fig. 3.6, the variance of D used is β × L′Nα2, where β = 0.65. From Fig. 3.6, the distortion power
can be significantly reduced by using SLM and hence the BER can be improved.
3.6 Conclusion
In this paper, the methods of use tail-biting turbo code to generate SLM candidates for reducing
both PAPR and BER were proposed. Several candidates used in SLM are generated from a tail-
biting turbo code. No explicit side information is needed. This proposed SLM employing tail-biting
turbo code can be used to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM systems, no error propagation is observed,
unlike the method used in [15]. We also combine RCF/RCF-DPB with SLM for BER reduction.
Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that RCF/RCF-DPB combined with SLM can
effectively reduce the BER by using appropriate criterion. With the proposed methods, a TCOFDM
system can achieve both low PAPR and low BER.

Multiple-Candidate Separation for
PTS-based OFDM Systems by
Turbo Decoding
4.1 Introduction
It is well known that orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems have high peak-
to-average power ratio (PAPR). An OFDM symbol consists of a number of independently modulated
subcarriers and large PAPR occurs when these subcarriers are added up coherently. If the power
amplifier is not operated with large back-offs, then high out-of-band emission occurs. If the power
amplifier is operated with large back-offs, the power efficiency of the amplifier is low. Consequently,
PAPR reduction techniques are highly desired.
Similar to the selected mapping (SLM) presented in [10][31][32], partial transmit sequences (PTS)
[21][22] is a redundancy-based PAPR reduction scheme. It is implemented by partitioning the OFDM
tones into disjoint sub-blocks and each sub-block is weighted by a phase rotation factor. The weighted
sub-blocks are combined to form a modified OFDM symbol called candidate. Different phase rotation
factors will result in different OFDM symbols with different PAPRs. The OFDM symbol with the
minimum PAPR is chosen for actual transmission. Instead of using the phase-rotation-based PTS
described above, cyclical-shift-based PTS [23] can be used to improve the PAPR performance and
avoid the usage of complex multipliers. Compared to the SLM, PTS has a lower complexity of IFFT
and FFT if the same number of candidates is used.
In general, the transmission of side information (SI) is needed to tell the receiver which candidate
is transmitted and erroneous decision of SI will seriously degrade the error performance. One solution
is to reserve several sub-carriers (i.e., pilot tones) for SI. However, the useful data rate is reduced. In
[16], the redundancy of trellis coded modulation (TCM) can be used to avoid the explicit SI insertion
for the phase-rotation-based PTS. A maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm for jointly decoding the
TCM and detecting which candidate is transmitted through the PTS was proposed to alleviate the
degradation in error performance caused by the incorrect SI. On the other hand, in [17], the authors
specially arranged the constellations of the subcarriers for each candidate such that the pair-wise
distance between each pair of candidates can be as large as possible. The PTS scheme does not need
the transmission of SI and no degradation in error performance is observed [17].
In this project, we propose two methods for multiple-candidate separation through turbo decod-
ing. The first method is based on few pilot tones for SI and hence is a semi-blind method. The

with the minimum PAPR. Remember that the pilot tone Xpm is set to be 1, m = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1,
initially. After the candidate selection process of the PTS scheme, the symbol transmitted by the
pilot tone Xpm is b
opt
m . Consequently, these pilot tones can be used to estimate b
opt at the receiver.
Cyclical-shift-based PTS scheme
Instead of the phase-rotation-based method, the PAPR can be reduced by cyclical-shift-based PTS
scheme, which is implemented by cyclically shifting x0, x1, · · · , xM−1 by τ0, τ1, τ2, · · · , τM−1
positions, respectively [23]. Assuming that each τm has g possible values, the shifted sequence
for xm is denoted as x
z
m ≡ (xz0,m, xz1,m, . . . , xzLN−1,m), where xzd,m = x[(d−τm)mod(LN),m], for d =
0, 1, 2, . . . , LN−1. Let Υ denote the set of all possible shifting positions for xzm, m = 0, 1, · · · ,M−1.
Consequently, |Υ| = g. The optimal shift position vector Γopt ≡ (τopt0 , τopt1 , . . . , τoptM−1) is chosen to
minimize the maximum peak power of all the time-domain signal combinations according to
Γopt = min

 . (4.3)
Then we can obtain the candidate with the minimum peak power. Since the average power for
each possible candidate is the same, the candidate with the minimum peak power is also the candidate
with the minimum PAPR. Remember that the pilot tone Xpm is set to be 1, m = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1,
initially. After the candidate selection process of the PTS scheme, the symbol transmitted by the
pilot tone Xpm contains the information about τ
opt
m . These pilot tones can be used to estimate τ

at the receiver.

∑M−1
m=0 Xˆm.
Step 2 Based on proper criteria which will be described in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, the ξ ≤ g most
likely phase rotations (bˆm,0, bˆm,1, . . . , bˆm,ξ−1) for each sub-block Xˆm are obtained.
Step 3 These estimated phase rotations are used to obtain Xˆζm = Xˆmbˆ
∗
m,ζ , ζ = 0, 1, . . . , ξ − 1,m =
0, 1, . . . ,M − 1, where superscript ∗ denotes the complex conjugate. Then these M disjoint
sub-blocks are combined to from complete candidates, Xˆ
c
, c = 0, 1, . . . , ξM − 1. Hence, there
are ξM candidates, which are then sent into the MAP demapper [33] to calculate the LLR
values of labeling bits.
Step 4 These LLR values are then forwarded to the turbo decoder to yield the reliability of each
message bit according to the BCJR algorithm presented in [34].
Step 5 At the s-th iteration, the absolute values of LLRs of all the information bits are summed,
i.e.,
∑
k |Lc,s(uk)|, for the c-th candidate, where Lc,s(uk) denotes the a posterori LLR of
information bit uk produced at the s-th iteration for candidate c. Then the most reliable
candidate, i.e., the one with the largest
∑
k |Lc,s(uk)|, is selected to continue the remaining
I − s iterations of the turbo decoding, where I is the maximum number of turbo decoding.
Note that there is no iteration loop between the turbo decoder and the demapper.
4.3.2 Semi-blind method
For the semi-blind method, the associated transmitter is the same as the conventional one shown
in Fig. 4.1. The criterion used to select ξ phase rotations for the m-th sub-block described in Step
2 of Section 4.3.1 is based on the received pilot Xˆpm. The pilot tone is first used to compute the
conditional probability Xˆpm, according to
p(Xˆpm|bm) = Kcexp(
|Xˆpm − bm|2
2σ2
)
= Kcexp(
|Xˆpm − exp(j 2pimg )|2
2σ2
)
(4.4)
where Kc is a constant, for m = 0, 1, . . . ,M − 1. Then, the ξ < g most likely phase rotations
(bˆm,0, bˆm,1, . . . , bˆm,ξ−1) are obtained according to (4.4). In this method, the separation capability
among multiple candidates is relied on both the pilots and turbo decoding.
Note that the conventional receiver can be viewed as the proposed receiver using the semi-blind
method with ξ = 1. Since there are pilot tones used in this method, we call the semi-blind method.
Step 1 For m = 0, 1, . . . ,M − 1, Based on the criterion (4.4),
Step 2 The following procedure is described as section 4.3.1 Step 3 - Step 5 to recovery the trans-
mitted data.
4.3.3 Blind method
When data rate loss due to the pilot insertion is concerned, we can remove the insertion of pilot
tones at the transmitter. At the receiver, ξ = g phase rotations for each subblock Xˆm should be
considered in Step 2 of Section 4.3.1, since no pilot can be used to estimate the phase rotations.
In this method, the separation capability among multiple candidates is only relied on the turbo
decoding.
The blind method is described as follows.

4.4.2 Error performance
Fig. 4.4 shows the BER performance in AWGN channels for the phase-rotation-based PTS scheme
using the proposed multiple-candidate separation methods when Q = 4. For comparison, the results
of PTS using the conventional method and perfect side information are also included. It can be seen
that an obvious error floor occurs for PTS using the conventional method, since incorrect detection
of phase rotation significantly degenerates the error performance. Using the proposed semi-blind
method, this error floor can be reduced.
When the rate loss due to the pilot tones and better error performance are concerned, the
proposed blind method can be used. Instead of the semi-blind method using both pilot and coding,
in this method, only the discrimination capability of the turbo coding is utilized to choose the most
probable combination of phase rotations and hence candidate. From Fig. 4.4, it can be seen that
the blind method provides error performance similar to the case of using perfect side information
without any rate loss. Fig. 4.5 shows the case of using Q = 8. Results similar to the case of using
Q = 4 can be seen.
For the proposed blind and semi-blind methods, gM−1 = 4 and ξM−1 = 2 possible combinations
of phase rotations must be tested at the receiver respectively when Q = 4. Consequently, the receiver
complexity of the proposed methods is increased compared to the conventional method. The receiver
complexity of PTS scheme using the proposed blind (semi-blind) method is about 1.25 (1.08) times
larger than the PTS scheme using the conventional method. If Q = 8 is used, the complexity of
the proposed blind (semi-blind) is about 1.58 (1.25) times larger than the PTS scheme using the
conventional method.

large number of sub-blocks. In this paper, we propose using a phase-quantization-based demapper
[36], which was originally used in non-coherent communications, in the proposed receiver to recover
the transmit data. Using the proposed blind receiver, we can achieve a comparable error performance
with a lower receiver complexity compared to the blind and semi-blind receivers presented in Chapter
IV.
The proposed scheme can be extended to MIMO channel environment by using a popular space-
frequency modulation, known as the Alamouti scheme, which provides full diversity gain with a
simple transmitter and receiver. But, the aforementioned method requires channel state informa-
tion at receiver. In this project, we also consider the case in which neither the transmitter nor the
receiver of a multiple antenna system knows the channel state information (CSI) in Rayleigh flat
fading channels. In order to reduce the use of training symbols, the DSFBC and the Fourier-Based
USTM are applied to proposed system . In [37] [38], Tarokh and Jafarkhani developed a differential
STBC which the differential modulation was combined with the orthogonal STBC and a differential
space time block codes using nonconstant modulus constellations (i.e., 16QAM) was proposed in
[39]. (An attempt to achieve the non coherent channel capacity in [40] was USTM [41], in which
PSK signals are considered, and the signal vector transmitted by one antenna is orthogonal to the
other.) In the Fourier-based USTM PTS-OFDM system, we estimate channel amplitude by LMMSE
estimator and jointly quantize channel phase and PTS weighting phase. Both the DSTBC and the
Fourier-Based USTM are applied to obtain a good PAPR performance and have a BER performance
4 ∼ 6dB away from coherent systems.
5.2 System Model for OFDM System
Fig. 5.1 shows the block diagram for the system investigated in this paper. For an OFDM symbol,
the relationship between the time-domain sample xn, n = 0, 1, · · · , N −1, and the frequency-domain
sub-carrier Xk, k = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, can be written as
xn =
1√

The PAPR value for an OFDM symbol is defined as
PAPR =
max0≤n≤N−1 |xn|2
1
N ·
∑N−1
n=0 |xn|2
. (5.2)
The basic idea of the phase-shift-based PTS [42] is to first partition the input data sequence
X into M disjoint sub-blocks. The length-N vector X(m), is then obtained by adding zeros into
the unselected sub-carrier positions in the m-th sub-block, which originally contains only N/M
symbols, for m = 0, 1, · · · ,M −1. After applying IFFT to X(m), we have x(m) which is then rotated
by the weighting factor b˜m ∈ {ej2piω/W | ω = 0, 1, · · · ,W − 1}. The optimal weighting-factor vector
b = [b0, b1, · · · , bM−1] can be obtained according to

Step 5 Repeat Step 4 for (M − Lc − 1) times. At row index m = M − Lc, we decide the remaining
weighting factors b˜M−Lc, b˜M−Lc+1, · · · , and b˜M−1 at the same time. Take b˜ as the decided
weighting-factor vector b.
It is worth noting that the TFS algorithm with Lc = M can perform the optimal exhaustive
search to find the optimal weighting-factor vector.
5.3.2 Proposed Iterative TFS (ITFS) Algorithm
We now present an iterative TFS algorithm (ITFS) that can achieve a comparable PAPR perfor-
mance and provide lower search complexity compared to the TFS algorithm reported in [35]. LetWq
and Lcq denote the number of phase rotations and the length of search window at the q-th iteration,
respectively. Figs. 5.2(a) and (b) show the trellis structures of the first and second iterations for the
ITFS algorithm respectively using (W1, Lc1) = (4, 3) and (W2, Lc2) = (3, 2). In each iteration of the
ITFS algorithm, most steps are the same as those of the TFS algorithm described in Section III-A.
However, besides updating the value of b˜m from the path with the 1st minimum peak power value,
we also record other weighting-factor nodes on the paths with larger peak-power values. After up-
dating b˜m, we mark the node with “the 1st recorded node”, shown by the box symbols in Fig. 5.2-(a).
If the path with has the 2nd minimum peak power also passes the 1st recorded node, we will skip
this path and find the next one with a larger peak-power value, until we find a path that does not
pass the 1st recorded node at the m-th column (sub-block) of the trellis. Then, we mark this node
with “the 2nd recorded node”, shown by the star symbols in Fig. 5.2-(a). Repeating this process, we
can mark all of the nodes at the m-th column of the trellis.
At the 1st iteration, we successively move the search window of length Lc1, and then record these
nodes according to peak-power values, as mentioned above. At row index m =M − Lc1, similar to
Step 5 of the TFS algorithm, we record the weighting-factor nodes at the M −Lc1+1, M −Lc1+2,
· · · , and M − 1 sub-blocks using the peak-power values calculated in the (M −Lc1)-th partial trellis
search. At the next iteration, we reshape the trellis structure by deleting the factor nodes labeled
with “the last recorded node” and use a search window of length Lc2. The flow chart for the proposed
ITFS algorithm is given in Fig. 5.3.
Through the experimental results, it is suggested that in order to have a better trade-off between
the search complexity and the PAPR performance, one should choose the Wq value and the number
of iterations, denoted as NI , as large as possible, and use a smaller window length Lcq, when the
iteration number q is small.
5.3.3 Complexity for the ITFS Algorithm
Let Cq, q = 1, 2, · · · , NI , denote the search complexity for the q-th iteration of the ITFS algorithm.
Following a similar definition given in [35], the total search complexity of the ITFS algorithm can
be calculated according to
CITFS =
NI∑
q=1
Cq =
NI∑
q=1

5.5.1 Proposed Transmitter using Space-Frequency Modulation
We extend the proposed PTS-OFDM system to the MIMO channel environment, and assume that
neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel coefficients. The block diagram of the
proposed transmitter is shown in Fig. 5.6. Two suitable noncoherent space-time modulation schemes
for the considered scenario are differential space-frequency block code (DSFBC) [37][39] and Fourier-
based unitary space-time modulation (USTM) [43], which can reduce the use of training symbol and
avoid channel estimation. Moreover, the complexity of the DSFBC receiver is comparable with that
of the Alamouti STBC using a coherent receiver, which provides full diversity gain with very simple
transmitter and receiver architecture [39].
Differential Space-Frequency Modulation
The DSTBC schemes using QAM constellation and PSK constellation were proposed in [39] and
[37], respectively. The encoding procedures of the scheme presented in [39] are similar to those
presented in [37]. However, the power of the current transmit symbol needs to be normalized by
the power of the previously transmit symbol. Let vector X˜ denote the input symbol vector with 16
QAM constellation and vectors S1 and S2 denote the transmit symbol vectors at antenna 1 and 2
in frequency domain, respectively. The encoding process is as follows:
(S1k, S
2
k) =
X˜k(S
1
k−2, S
2
k−2) + X˜k+1(−S2∗k−2, S1∗k−2)√
|S1k−2|2 + |S2k−2|2
, (5.13)
(S1k+1, S
2
k+1) = (−S2∗k , S1∗k ), (5.14)
where Sik, i = 1, 2, k = 2, · · · , N − 2, denotes the transmit symbol at antenna i and carrier index
k, and the reference symbols (S10 , S
2
0) can be selected from 16QAM constellation arbitrary. This
method can be viewed as a two-antenna differential Alamouti STBC scheme which encodes input
data (X˜k, X˜k+1) into Alamouti form and multiply previously transmit matrix as
S˜2k´ =
X˜2k´S˜2k´−2
a2k´−2
, (5.15)
where a2k´−2 =
√
|S1
2k´−2|2 + |S22k´−2|2,
S˜2k´ =
(
S1
2k´
S1
2k´+1
S2
2k´
S2
2k´+1
)
, X˜2´k =
(
X˜2k´ −X˜∗2k´+1
X˜2k´+1 X˜
∗
2k´
)
(5.16)
k´ = 2, 3, ..., (N − 2)/2.
Fourier-based Unitary Space Time Modulation
The Fourier-based USTM was proposed in [43]. Instead of using the overall USTM transmit scheme,
we only use the property of Fourier-type phase rotations between transmit signals through different
antennas. The input symbol vector X˜ will be sent through the first antenna, and the symbol
vector at the second antenna is a phase-rotated version of X˜ determined by the carrier positions.
Mathematically, the rule is shown as follows:
S2k = X˜k · ej
2pii
N/M = S1k · ej
2pii
N/M , (5.17)
45
Assume that the channel power (|h1|2 + |h2|2) can be estimated. In Equation (23), the channel
power is divided with the power of the previously signal
√
|S12k−2|2 + |S22k−2|2, and the input data
X˜2k can thus be obtained. Similarly, X˜2k+1 can be obtained by
R2kR
∗
2k−1 −R∗2k+1R2k−2
= (|h1|2 + |h2|2)
√
|S12k−2|2 + |S22k−2|2X˜2k+1 + w
′′
(5.23)
Channel Power Estimator for DSFBC
In [39], the authors proposed a channel power estimator which utilizes all the received signals. To
estimate the channel power, the received signal matrix is first multiplied by its Hermitian transpose:
RHR =|h1|2(S1)HS1 + |h1|2(S2)HS2 + 2ℜ{h1∗h2(S1)HS2}
+ 2ℜ{h1WHS1}+ 2ℜ{h2WHS2}+WHW (5.24)
where S1 = [S10 , S
1
1 , · · · , S1N−1] and S2 = [S20 , S21 , · · · , S2N−1] are the transmitted signal vectors from
antenna one and two, respectively. R is the received signal vector. Taking the expectation for the
above equation, we have
RHR = N(|h1|2 + |h2|2) +Nσ2w (5.25)
Thus, the channel power estimator p = |h1|2 + |h2|2 is
pˆB =
E{RHR} −Nσ2w
N
≈ E{R
HR}
N
≍ R
HR
N
. (5.26)
Fourier-based Unitary Space-Time Demodulation
In the following, we will discuss the demodulation for the Fourier-based USTM. Considering the case
of using two transmitter antennas and one receiver antenna, the received signal at the k-th carrier
position after FFT can be expressed as
Yk = h
1X˜k + h
2X˜ke
j 2pik
N/M
= X˜k(h
1 + h2ej
2pik
N/M )
= Xk · bi mod (N/M)(h1 + h2ej
2pik
N/M ) (5.27)
where ht, t = 1, 2 is the channel coefficient, and X˜k is the signal after phase rotated by the PTS
weighting vector b. After reorganizing the equation, we have
Yk = Xk · bk mod (N/M)(h1 + h2ej
2pik
N/M )
= Xk(h
1ej
2piw
W + h2ej

N/M ej

W )
= Xk(|h1|ej( 2piwW +θh1) + |h2|ej(
2pik
N/M
+ 2piwW +θh2))
= Xk(|h1|ejθ1 + |h2|ejθ2), (5.28)
where |ht|, t = 1, 2 is the amplitude of the channel coefficient. Different from the detector provided
for the SISO channel, the quantization parameters now raise to (θ1, θ2), and the parameters of the

Table 5.2: Comparison of search complexity when
M = 16 and PAPR0 =6.75 dB.
Comparison with the receivers proposed in Chapter IV
In this subsection, we compare the BER performance and the receiver complexity for the proposed
receiver and the blind and semi-blind receivers investigated in Chapter IV. In the blind receiver given
in Chapter IV, all the possible WM weighting-factor vectors are considered in the receiver. Message
bits can thus be decoded without using side information. To reduce the receiver complexity, a semi-
blind receiver, in which only qM , q < W , weighting-factor vectors are considered in the receiver, is
also provided in Chapter IV. In Fig. 5.5, we give the BER performance and the normalized receiver
complexity CR for the three receivers. It can be seen that the three receivers have comparable
BER performance. However, the proposed receiver has a lower complexity when comparing to the
semi-blind receiver proposed in Chapter IV. Note that CR is obtained by first calculating the total
number of branches in both the demapper and the decoder, and then normalizing to the complexity
of the proposed receiver.
When we intend to increase the value of M in order to obtain a better PAPR performance, it
is found that the complexity for both the blind and semi-blind receivers proposed in Chapter IV
will have an exponential growth, and the two receivers will become too complex to be implemented.
Although the complexity growth for the semi-blind receiver can be mitigated by choosing a smaller
value of g, the BER performance will also be significantly degraded. On the other hand, since the
demapping is performed sub-block by sub-block for the proposed receiver, the increase of the M
(the number of sub-blocks) value does not lead to any complexity growth. This property allows us
to improve the PAPR performance without any receiver complexity increase or BER performance
loss.
5.6.2 Simulation Results for MIMO-OFDM System
PAPR Performance for MIMO System
In this subsection, the proposed ITFS algorithm is applied to the phase-shift-based PTS-OFDM
system using Alamouti SFBC. Simulation results in Fig. 5.9 shows that the ITFS algorithm provides
the same PAPR performance when comparing to that provided by the TFS algorithm, and the
reduction of search complexity in the MIMO system is shown in Table I. Applying the ITFS algorithm
to DSFBC PTS-OFDM or Fourier-based USTM PTS-OFDM system, the same result of reduce
search complexity can be obtained. Therefor, we can clime that the proposed ITFS algorithm are
suitable for both SISO and MIMO systems.
BER Performance for MIMO System

Fourier-based USTM, and SFBC. In Fig. 5.10, we compare the proposed system using the nonco-

Chapter 6
Conclusion
In OFDM systems, the high PAPR is its main drawback. In this project, we construct several
schemes to alleviate and improve its performance. To achieve a good error-correction performance
with capacity-approaching capability, outer turbo codes are utilized in most of the investigated
systems. The distortion-based scheme, which is called deliberate power boost (DPB), is proposed to
reduce the PAPR. By analysis and simulation, we have showed that PAPR can be reduced by using
the proposed method. We have combined DPB with RCF for further PAPR reduction.
Another aspect of PAPR reduction techniques such as redundancy-based scheme is also proposed
to solve this problem. In this project, both SLM and PTS are investigated. In order to achieve
reliable communication, powerful turbo codes are utilized in these schemes. The method of using
tail-biting turbo code to generate SLM candidates for reducing both PAPR and BER is proposed.
No explicit side information is needed. This proposed SLM employing tail-biting turbo code can be
used to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM systems, no error propagation is observed. We also combine
RCF/RCF-DPB with SLM for BER reduction. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate
that RCF/RCF-DPB combined with SLM can effectively reduce the BER by using appropriate
criterion.
We have presented two methods (blind and semi-blind) to choose the most likely candidate for
PTS-based OFDM systems by using the discrimination capability of the turbo decoding. The pro-
posed method can apply to phase-rotation-based and cyclical-shift-based PTS and achieve petter
BER performance even without using the pilots at the cost of reasonable increase in receiver com-
plexity. With the proposed methods, we can design turbo coded OFDM systems that achieves both
low PAPR and low BER. Considering the trade-off between the PAPR/BER performance and the
complexity, we further propose an iterative trellis-based factor search (ITFS) algorithm to reduce
the search complexity. Another blind receiver based on phase-quantization-based demapper is also
devised to reduce the receiver complexity. At last, the overall system is extended to MIMO-OFDM
systems.

在編碼調變上也有不錯的性能, 但是 Non-binary LDPC code 在實際應用上最大的
問題在於其解碼複雜度太高. 因為這個議題才剛起步, 個人覺得這是值的突破的
地方.

designs using adsorbing set spectrum properties＂ 裡面介紹使用建碼的方
式來降低 adsorbing set 的個數以降低 Error floor 的方法令人感興趣.

Grandvrio離石垣市區較遠，受天氣影響我們不克前往參加星期五晚上的Get-Together on 
Friday。因此我們只能等待10月23日當天早上報告之前再行前往進行報到與註冊的手續。 
 
學生陳彥銘的報告 翁詠祿教授的報告 
 
 
Prof. A. J. Han Vinck的報告  
 
  在10月23日星期六當天早上，天氣總算有所好轉。我們原本的報告時程是在早上的
10:30~12:00這個時段，然而我們到達會場之後才發現，由於颱風的關係有部份的與會者
滯留在沖繩那霸而無法準時到達，因此議程向後順延了。在等待的過程中，我們巧遇了
同樣參加此次會議的Prof. A. J. Han Vinck，並且和他短暫的交談了一下。在吃過午飯後
議程正式開始。翁詠祿教授的報告在第一個時段(13:30~15:30)，而學生陳彥銘的報告在
第二個時段(16:00~17:40)。在這兩段議程中除了我們二人的報告之外，我比較有興趣且
印象深刻的演講主題是來自台灣大學的林茂昭教授的主題＂The Separation Capability of 
Cosets of Random-Like Codes＂、來自西安電子科技大學的蔡寧教授的主題＂Adaptive 
 15
  另一方面，蔡寧教授的主題＂Adaptive Randomized Convolutional Network Coding＂
主要是著重在解決random network code的field size太大的問題，另外他提出的此一作法還
能提供較小的延遲與記憶體的需求。 
  在 Prof. A. J. Han Vinck 的主題＂Template Protection and Biometric Verification＂
方面，生物資訊和編碼的結合是以往本實驗室還沒有涉入的主題，而藉由他的解說，
讓我們對這方面的知識有了一些基本的了解。 Prof. A. J. Han Vinck 不但在這方面的
技術上著墨不少，而且他的言談之中也對做學問的態度和方法上提供了一些嶄新的
想法。 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
四、建議 
首先感謝國科會計畫國外差旅費的補助和支持。參加本次研討會，除了與優秀學
者交流研究資訊之外，對於外語能力以及人際關係上的增進也很重要。在此感謝此
一經費上的補助，讓我們獲得如此寶貴的經驗。也希望因參與國際研討會而得到的
面對面交流的機會，能夠提升台灣的研究水準與國際學術研究上的能見度。

說明： 
本計畫原本想要建構具有接近通道容量及低峰均值的編碼多天線正交分頻多工系統,因此
本計畫大部分的系統都使用渦輪碼(Turbo code).但是在計畫執行的過程中發現已有類似的系
統, 評估後覺得要在這方面很難有所突破, 因此計畫方向轉向對降低PAPR的一些相關技術提
出一些性能或複雜度上的改進.
