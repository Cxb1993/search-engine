Abstract 
Massively parallel maskless lithography 
(MPML2) system has been developed by the 
joint group in National Taiwan University. 
MPML2 is a multiple electron beam direct-
write system which aims at 22 nm node 
semiconductor manufacturing. For 
electrostatic lens design of MPML2, a 
simulator capable of 2D and 3D electrostatic 
lens simulation is implemented. This 
simulator consists three parts: field 
computation, trajectory simulation, and 
optical performance evaluation. Electrostatic 
field of lenses is evaluated via finite element 
method (FEM) with the core of COMSOL 
Multiphysics, while the other two parts are 
developed under MATLAB environment. For 
electron trajectory simulation, ideal and 
practical trajectories can be computed. For 
optical property evaluation, the primary 
geometrical and chromatic aberrations are 
evaluated for rotationally symmetrical lenses. 
Besides the conventional aberration analysis, 
direct ray tracing method for minimum spot 
size is also proposed and implemented. 
Finally, this simulator is applied to e-beam 
direct-write system design and analysis for 
preliminary lens design of MPML2. The Lens 
parameters of MPML2 are determined 
successfully.

3. Trajectory Simulation 
Electron trajectories reveal how the lens 
works, and there are two types of electron 
trajectories. One is the practical trajectory 
which is direct traced directly from the field 
distribution, and it is the real path of electron 
in the EOS. The other is the ideal trajectory, 
or Gaussian trajectory, which is computed 
under paraxial approximation and it, describes 
the perfect optical behavior. Gaussian 
trajectory is important to lens design and 
aberration evaluation.  
3.1 Practical Trajectory Simulation Result 
Since individual beam in MPML2 is 
operated in low current and low energy. 
Interactions between electrons are neglect in 
this simulator. Hence the practical trajectory 
can be described by Lorentz’s equation 
 
0( )
d
m v eE
dt
 
  (3) 
where 0m  is rest mass of the electron, v

 is the 
velocity e  is electron charge, E

is electric 
field, and   is the Lorentz factor in special 
relativity. To solve Lorentz’s equation 
numerically and precisely, 4
th
 order Runge-
Kutta method is applied [6]. The concept of 
4
th
 order Runge-Kutta method is to evaluate 
the position and velocity of next step with a 
weighted sum of four new data predicted, and 
so that the discrete step error can be well 
controlled. Through the above-mentioned, real 
trajectory result can be obtained and simulated. 
Fig. 3 shows an example of three-electrode 
lens, in which the structure and simulation 
settings are listed in Table 1.

 Since above simulation settings and three-

determined, real trajectory is computed by 
direct interpolation method, and the result is 
plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

quality analysis. Aberrations are the 
mismatches between the real image and the 
idea image estimated from Gaussian trajectory 
equation. They provide not only a standard 
manner to analyze blurring image, but a 
classification of causes of image degradation. 
Aberrations result from not only the 
geometrical design of the optical system, but 
the variation of initial energy of electrons. The 
former is called geometrical aberration, while 
the latter is called chromatic aberration [3] [5] 
[8]. 
The primary causes of image degradation 
are 3
rd
 order geometrical aberrations and 3
rd
 
order chromatic aberration. 3

where ˆ o represents the spread of initial

cC  is the central 
chromatic aberration coefficient, and 
cC  is the 
chromatic aberration coefficient of 
magnification. Details of derivation of 
aberration equations can be referred to 
reference [5] and reference [8]. 
   Aberration analysis is useful in projection 
lithographic or microscopic systems. For 
probe-forming system, the spot size on wafer 
is more important than aberration coefficients. 
Thus direct ray tracing method rises and gains 
more and more interests. This method relies 
on computing a set of rays with different 
initial conditions, and then analyzes the lens 
performance with the collective and statistic 
result of these rays. The more non-ideal 
effects the simulator can estimate, the more 
non-ideal factors are contains in the analysis 
results. Likewise, the more precise the ray 
trajectory is evaluated, the more accurate the 
analysis result obtained. 
Here two methods for minimum spot size 
evaluation are proposed. First, as the green 
lines in Fig.  show, the spatial radius variation 
along optical axis is evaluated with its 
envelope of ray trajectories. Intuitively, the 
narrowest part of the envelope near the image 
plane is the

evaluation. 
minimum spot requested in probe forming 
systems. This scheme treats each ray with the 
same weighting, so that each kind of initial 
conditions has the same significance to spot 
size. However, this treatment may not be 
consistent with the practice. Since there are 
always energy and current distributions inside 
the electron beam. To approach the reality, 
initial condition of rays should be considered. 
In e-beam lithographic system, since electron 
energy and charge density are two important 
parameters in resist exposure process, current 
distributions should be added into 
considerations during minimum spot size 
determination. 
Special weightings are added to rays so that 
each ray is no longer an electron trajectory but 
a current flow. These weightings should 
follow the current distribution of the source. 
Thus, to apply this weighted simulation, the 
current distribution of the source should be 
known in advance. The red lines in Fig.  are

central voltage. A roughly trail and error 
process is done at first to determined the range 
of voltages which enforces the beam 
converged and the minimum spot located near 
the 3.25 mm after the einzel lens. From Fig. 
12, the central voltage is selected to be 2320V 
and the spot size at the 3.25 mm after einzel 
lens is evaluated in ~38nm.

Then we performed two simulations to 
clarify the effects of thickness variation of 
electrode or spacer. Fig. 13 shows the 
minimum spot size and location changes with 
the spacer thickness which varies within ±50 
um. In the same manner,   variation is added 
on electrode thickness, and the corresponding 
change of minimum spot size and location are 
plotted in Fig. 14. From the figures, we can 
find that the thickness variation of electrode 
and spacer has very little effect to minimum 
spot radius (< 2 nm). 
In the previous design, the minimum spot 
radius is ~38 nm, and it is too large for e-
beam lithography. Thus, it is necessary to 
reduce minimum spot radius. However, in the 
preliminary system, there is only one lens to 
focus the beam, and hence, reduction of 
minimum spot radius can only be done by 
limiting the emission angle. Fig. 15 shows that 
minimum spot radius and position vary 
apparently with respect to emission angle. 
From Fig. 15, the emission

angle should be reduced to 10 mrad for 10 nm 
beam radius, and 5 mrad for 1.2nm. Thus, 
beam limiting aperture can be applied at the 
region between source and lens. Fig. 16 shows 
the design parameters of the preliminary EOS 
of MPML2. The limiting aperture diameter is 
designed to be 3 um to achieve 1.2 nm beam 
radius. Hence, the preliminary EOS design of 
MPML2 has done with the assistance of the 
simulator.
