sealing spacer, eventually exiting the cell. The 
light illuminating the D-NTF is therefore 
captured whereas the light illuminating the 
sealing spacer is wasted. This phenomenon is 
evident in a grid-type DSSC [10, 11]. In Lee et 
al. [10] and Ramasamy et al. [11], the use of 
multiple sealing spacers to seal each cell 
separately resulted in excessive light penetration 
into the sealing spacers, which rendered them 
unusable. Restated, the light harvesting 
efficiency of the DSSC can be enhanced by 
directing the light toward the D-NTF before it 
illuminates the sealing spacer. Therefore, this 
work proposes a transparent external lightguide 
(EL) that improves the photovoltaic 
performance of the DSSC by directing light 
toward the D-NTF. 
 
2. EL Design 
Figure 1 shows that, in an illuminated 
DSSC, some light received by the D-NTF of the 
photo electrode (PE) is absorbed by the dye. 
Some light also penetrates the photo electrode 
(PE), the sealing spacers (SS) and the counter 
electrode (CE), in that order, before finally 
exiting the cell. Hence, the light illuminating the 
sealing spacer was wasted. To obtain a high 
light harvesting efficiency, this study used an 
external lightguide (EL) made of a transparent 
medium to direct the light toward the D-NTF. 
To maximize the intensity of light received by 
the D-NTF, the EL is designed to minimize 
optical loss along all trajectories of incoming 
light. Accordingly, the EL exploits both normal 
incidence and total internal reflection (TIR). 
The normal incidence condition ensures that the 
light travels from medium 1 into medium 2 with 
the lowest possible reflection loss. The TIR 
condition ensures that the light travels from 
medium 1 into medium 2 without transmission 
loss. Figure 2 presents an EL architecture that 
satisfies both conditions. The figure clearly 
reveals that the EL has a symmetric prism 
structure whose geometry is defined by two 
optical angles (ߠ௔  and ߠ௕ ) and four optical 
interfaces ( ଵܵ, ܵଶ, ܵଷ and ܵସ). The trajectories 
of rays 1 and 2 clearly show that this design 
meets the normal incidence condition as light 
travels through the air and enters the EL. When 
the light travels from EL into air across 
interfaces ଵܵ and ܵଶ, TIR occurs, ensuring an 
absence of transmission loss. Hence, the 
incident angle ߠଵ  should satisfy the TIR 
condition. The ߠଵ for TIR is obtained by the 
Snell's law: 
ߠଵ ൐ sinିଵ ൬ 1݊ா௅൰                                 ሺ1ሻ 
 
where ݊ா௅ is the refractive index of the 
EL. After the light rays are reflected from 
interfaces ଵܵ  and ܵଶ  they are normally 
incident at interfaces ܵଷ and ܵସ, respectively, 
which maximizes transmittance and minimizes 
reflection loss. Based on the ߠଵ for TIR and 
the normal incidence at interfaces ܵଷ and ܵସ, 
the optical angles ߠ௔ and ߠ௕, respectively, of 
the symmetric prism structure are obtained 
using the following formulae. 
 
ߠ௔ ൌ 90° െ ߠଵ                                    ሺ2ሻ 
 
ߠ௕ ൌ 2ߠଵ െ 90°                                ሺ3ሻ 
 
According to the above equations, the 
symmetric prism design depends on ߠଵ. The EL 
on the exterior of the DSSC photo electrode 
effectively directs the light toward the D-NTF 
(Fig. 3). Light arriving at the D-NTF has the 
4 
 
Acrylic resin was infused into the EL mold, 
which was then placed in a vacuum chamber to 
remove the air bubbles from the resin. A glass 
plate was placed on the top of the EL mold to 
level the acrylic resin. After the resin cured, the 
glass plate was removed, and the EL was 
released from the mold. The EL was divided 
into several sections (Fig. 6) to match the area 
of the D-NTF. 
 
4. Measurement of light harvesting efficiency 
In Figure 3, the EL was used to direct light 
toward the D-NTF of the photo electrode. 
Therefore, the analysis of the light harvesting 
efficiency focused on the D-NTF, and the 
experimental model of the DSSC that was 
utilized in measuring the light harvesting 
efficiency was simplified by including only the 
photo electrode. The experimental system that is 
presented in Figure 7 was established to 
investigate the light harvesting efficiency of the 
photo electrode with the ELs. The experimental 
system comprised (i) a solar power meter, (ii) a 
solar simulator, (iii) an FTO glass substrate and 
(iv) ELs. The solar power meter measured the 
solar light intensity, and its light-absorbing 
detector (area, 0.5 x 0.5 cm2) could be used as a 
D-NTF. The solar simulator, which was capable 
of simulating AM 1.5 solar radiation, was 
adjusted to 1000 W/m2, which is equivalent to 
one sun illumination. The FTO glass substrate 
deposited on the solar power detector served as 
the photo electrode. The ELs were then 
arranged on the FTO glass substrate to 
investigate the variations in light intensity 
displays by using the solar power meter. The 
light harvesting efficiency of the photo 
electrode with the ELs is obtained by 
calculation from the variations in light intensity. 
Figure 8 presents the light intensity 
variations of the photo electrode with and 
without the EL. Under one sun illumination of 
1000 W/m2 (AM 1.5), the photo electrode 
without the EL yielded an intensity of 831 
W/m2 on the detector as the D-NTF. Depositing 
one EL on the FTO glass substrate of the photo 
electrode increased intensity to 958 W/m2 and 
light harvesting efficiency by 15.28%. When the 
number of ELs was increased to two, intensity 
increased to 1086 W/m2, and light harvesting 
efficiency increased by 30.69%. As noted above, 
incorporating an EL effectively directed light 
toward the D-NTF of the photo electrode, which 
enhanced light harvesting efficiency. 
 
5. Preparation of DSSC 
The photo electrode was fabricated as 
follows. First, an acetic solution was prepared 
by mixing 2 g citric acid, 0.08 mL acetylacetone, 
0.2 mL Triton X-100 and 0.2 mL tetrabutyl 
orthotitanate in 3 mL purified water and stirring 
for 30 min. Then, a TiO2 paste was prepared by 
mixing 1 g TiO2 nanopowder (P25, Degussa) 
with acetic solution and stirring for 1 h. The 
nanoporous TiO2 film was obtained by coating 
an FTO glass substrate (Hartford Glass Co., 
USA, fluorine-doped SnO2 overlayer, sheet 
resistance: 7 Ω/sq) with TiO2 paste using a 
doctor-blade method and then sintering at 450 
˚C for 30 min. After sintering, measurement of 
the nanoporous TiO2 film with an Alpha-Step 
profilometer revealed a thickness of 
approximately 15 μm. The active area was 0.5 x 
0.5 cm2.  
The photo electrode was then soaked in a 
dye solution of 0.3 mM N719 dye in ethanol for 
24 h at room temperature. The photo electrode 
and the Pt counter electrode were separated

ABSTRACT 
In this study, a light guide component for enhancing light harvesting efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) 
was designed and developed through both optical simulated and experimental approaches. The light guide 
component is capable of being disposed on a photo electrode of DSSC to turn the light toward a dye covered 
nanoporous TiO2 film (D-NTF). The optical simulation results show that the light harvesting efficiency of DSSC can 
be effectively improved and the experimental power conversion efficiency can be enhanced as high as 39.78% for 
active area of 0.25 cm2. 
Keywords: light guide component; dye-sensitized solar cell; light harvesting efficiency; power conversion

1. Introduction 
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensively investigated in past few years [1-3], driven by their 
promises for future, cost-effective, easily mass production. DSSCs were comprised by four key components, which 
are respectively said photo electrode [4,5], said platinum (Pt) counter electrode [4-7] disposed opposite to the 
photo electrode, said electrolyte solution [5,6] contained iodide/tri-iodide redox couple between the photo and 
counter electrodes and said sealing spacer [8,9] for spacing the photo and counter electrodes and sealing the 
electrolyte solution. In general, the photo electrode was formed by a dye covered nanoporous TiO2 film (D-NTF) 
fabricated on a transparent conducting substrate and designated to perform the light-to-electricity operation. When 
the light illuminates the D-NTF of the photo electrode, the dye will be excited by the light, thereby leading to a fast 
injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and further movement toward the transparent conducting 
substrate. However, the light also illuminates the sealing spacer, then penetrates the sealing spacer and finally 
departs from the cell. This means that the light illuminated on the D-NTF could be effectively used. On the contrary, 
reflection (TIR) were applied to the LGC. The normal incidence condition was used to ensure that the light travels 
from medium 1 into medium 2 with a minimum reflection loss. The TIR condition was used to ensure that the light 
travels from medium 1 into medium 2 without any transmission loss. According to the above conditions, a suitable 
LGC structure was proposed as shown in Figure 2.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: LGC structure. 
 
In order to verify the effect of the LGC for enhancing the light harvesting efficiency, a ray-trace simulation for a 
DSSC with the LGC was performed. In this study, the LGC was used to turn the light toward the D-NTF of the photo 
electrode, which means that the analysis of the light harvesting efficiency could be focused at the D-NTF. 
Therefore, the simulation model for DSSC could be simplified as only the photo electrode. The software TracePro 
based on Monte-Carlo ray tracing method was applied to computer modeling of the photo electrode (PE) with the 
LGCs. The simulation model as shown in Figure 3, it was only consider geometrical optics and do not consider 
diffraction and polarization effects.

2.3 Fabrication and measurements of DSSC 
The photo electrode was fabricated by the procedures described below. First, an acetic solution was prepared by 
mixing 2 g citric acid, 0.08 mL acetylacetone, 0.2 mL Triton X-100 and 0.2 mL tetrabutyl orthotitanate in 3 mL 
purified water and stirring for 30 min. Then, a TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing 1 g TiO2 nanopowder (P25, 
Degussa) with the acetic solution and stirring for 1 h. The nanoporous TiO2 film was obtained by coating the TiO2 
paste on an FTO glass substrate (Hartford Glass Co., USA, fluorine-doped SnO2 overlayer, sheet resistance: 7 
Ω/sq) using a doctor-blade method and then sintered at 450 ˚C for 30 min. After sintering, the thickness of the 
nanoporous TiO2 film was about 15 µm measured using an Alpha-Step profilometer and the active area was 0.5 x 
0.5 cm2.  
 
Then the photo electrode was soaked in a dye solution of 0.3 mM N719 dye in ethanol for 24 h at room 
temperature. The photo electrode and the Pt counter electrode were sandwiched with 60 µm thick (before melting) 
surlyn polymer foil (Solaronix) as a sealing spacer. Sealing was done by keeping the structure in a hot-pressing at 
100 ˚C for few seconds. An electrolyte solution consisting of 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.5 M 
4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) in 3-methoxy propionitrile 
(MPN) was introduced into the cell gap to complete the fabrication of DSSC. In order to investigate the 
performance variation of DSSCs with and without the LGC, four LGCs were disposed on the DSSC as shown in 
Figure 6. The photovoltaic performances of DSSC were measured using a computer-controlled digital source 
meter (Keithley, Model: 2400) under one sun illumination of 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5 simulated light radiation).

3. Results and discussions 
 
3.1 Simulation results 
Figure 7 shows the ray tracing of the photo electrode (PE) with the LGCs, it could be observed that the light 
illuminated normal to the DSSC could be effectively turned toward the D-NTF via the LGCs. Figure 8 shows the 
simulation results of the photo electrodes with and without the LGC. As shown in Figure 8a, the photo electrode 
without the LGC has a total flux of 13.511 mW in the D-NTF with an active area of 0.25 cm2. The result as shown in 
Figure 8b was the case of the photo electrode with one LGC, it could be found that the total flux in the D-NTF was 
 3.2 Photovoltaic performances of DSSC with LGC 
Figure 9 shows the photographs of DSSC with and without the LGC under one sun illumination of 100 mW/cm2 
(AM 1.5). Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs with and without the LGC were presented in Table 1 and the 
photocurrent density versus voltage characteristic curves were shown in Figure 10. As the results, the DSSC 
without the LGC has an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.685 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.90 mA/cm2, fill 
factor (FF) of 0.591, and power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.79%. In the case of the DSSC with one LGC, Jsc and 
η were improved to 8.04 mA/cm2 and 3.16% respectively, as Jsc increased by 16.52% and η increased by 13.26%. 
In other case of the DSSC with two LGCs, Jsc and η were improved to 9.53 mA/cm2 and 3.49% respectively, as Jsc 
increased by 38.12% and η increased by 25.09%. When the amount of the LGC was increased to four, Jsc and η 
were improved as high as 10.83 mA/cm2 and 3.9% respectively, as Jsc increased by 56.96% and η increased by 
39.78%. In comparison to the simulation work, it could be found that the light harvesting efficiency increases as the 
photocurrent density increases and the power conversion efficiency increases. It was also demonstrated that the 
improvement of light harvesting efficiency strongly affect the photocurrent density of the DSSC.
