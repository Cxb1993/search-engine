人們能夠經常檢查自己的身體情況，而有助於早期偵測出心血管系統的問題。 
醫學研究指出運動後的心率恢復可以做為評估心血管系統狀況的有用指標，假如心率恢
復速度在第一分鐘內小於 15 次，則在未來會具有較高的死亡率。此記錄器有高度的輕便性可
於運動時隨身攜帶，所以能夠在運動場上就地記錄心率的恢復訊號波。雖然記錄器不能在記

2. Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to develop a low cost long term digital recorder for 
photoplethysmograph (PPG) and oxygen saturation signals.  The recorder is based on a MP3 
player with line-in recording.  The PPG signal is recorded as pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) 
signal.  A flash memory MP3 player with 1 GB of capacity can store more than 10 hours of signal.  
The maximum recording time is limited only by the capacity for the battery.  The digitized PAM 
signal is compressed into MP3 format and stored in flash memory.  The flash memory recorder is 
highly portable because it is small in size and very light weight.  An audio digital recorder 
generally uses a 16 bit analog-to-digital converter.  It provides a very high resolution and a very 
large dynamic range for the signal.  The recorded MP3 file is transferred to a computer through 
USB connection for signal processing and analysis.  Since a digital recorder is generally powered 
by a low voltage battery, there is no concern regarding electrical safety.  This safe and affordable 
physiological signal recorder allows people to self check their body condition more frequently.  It 
might be helpful in early detection of some cardiovascular disorders.  
The heart rate recovery after maximal exercise has been reported as a useful condition index 
for cardiovascular system.  If the recovery rate within the first minute is less than 15 beats, it 
indicates a higher mortality rate in the future.  This recorder can record the heart rate recovery 
signal in the playing field.  Although heart rate and oxygen saturation are not shown when the 
signal is being recorded, it actually makes the measurement more objective.  The measurement of 
heart rate and oxygen saturation were also compared with those by a commercial medical device.  
The difference in oxygen saturation reading between them was less than 2%, and the heart rate 
readings and trends were highly overlap.

3. Background 
Ischemic heart disease is the top cause of mortality throughout the world.  According to the 
cause of death statistic in 2006 by the Department of Health of Taiwan, heart disease is also at the 
third place of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan [DoH, 2006].  There were 9417 people 
died of heart disease at the age above 65 in 2006.  For people at the age between 45 and 65, there 
were 2194 died of heart diseases.  On the whole, about 94.5% of the total death by heart disease 
16 bits analog-to-digital converter which provides a relatively large dynamic range for the input 
signal.  The sampling frequency up to 48 kHz is high enough for most physiological signals. 
The block diagram of the recorder system is shown Figure 1.  The sensor probe is powered by 
a 3V Lithium battery.  An electronics oscillator alternately drives the red (654 nm) and the 
near-infrared (890 nm) LEDs with a frequency of 350 Hz for each.  The spectra of LEDs measured 
by a fiber optics spectrometer (USB-4000, Ocean Optics Inc.) are shown Figure 2.  Light traveled 
through finger tip is detected by a silicon photodiode and amplified.  The transmission light is 
modulated by the change in blood volume with heart beat.  The amplified signal is sent to a digital 
recorder (ME1280, Kalpa Inc.) through the line-in connector.  The digital recorder samples the 
signal and compresses it into an MP3 format.  This digitized signal is temporally stored in the 
flash memory.  Finally, the MP3 file is transmitted through an USB connection to a computer.  A 
computer program developed on MATLABTM is used to process the recorded signal to acquire the 
PPG signals.  Based on the PPG signals, both heart rate (HR) and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) 
were calculated.  To accurately calculate the value of pulse oxygen saturation, the measurement is 
calibrated with an SpO2 simulator (Index-2, Fluke Medical Inc.).

MP3 is a well accepted standard of compression format with adjustable compression ratio.  
The sampling frequency and compression ratio can cause different degree of signal distortion.  To 
study the influence of sampling rate and compression ratio.  The pulse amplitude modulation 
signal was sampled at 48 kHz and directly stored in uncompressed (.wav) format.  This original 
signal was then re-sampled in 16 kHz and 32 kHz and compressed in bit rates from 8 kbps to 192 
kbps.  These data files were analyzed by using the same computer program to calculate the signal 
trends of heart rate and oxygen saturation. 
The average relative errors (ARE) of heart rate and SpO2 waveforms between the original file 
and the compressed files was calculated to quantify the error caused by MP3 data compression.

Figure 5 The ARE of SpO2 using different sampling frequency and bit rates. 
 
The heart rate recovery measurement by this device was tested both after maximal exercise and 
non-maximal exercise.  Motion artifact during exercise did have a great influence on the 
calculation of heart rate and oxygen saturation.  However, once the exercise was stopped, the PPG 
signal quickly recovered.  The heart rate recovery still can be accurately measured. 
The maximal exercise for EECG requires the subject to reach the heart rate based on the 
following equation [Astrand, 1960]: 
 
HRmax (beats/min)= 220 – age                         (2) 
 
For the volunteers with age of 24 in this study, the heart rage has to go up to 196 beats/min.  
However, the heart rate is even hard for some volunteers to reach 180 beats/min.  In general, the 
heart rate took about 5 minutes to totally recover to its normal state after maximal exercise.  All 
four male volunteers have their heart rate drop more than 42 beats within the first 2 minutes after 
the maximal exercise. 
For non-maximal exercise, heart rate did not go up as high as in maximal exercise.  The heart 
rate recovery is also faster than after maximal exercise.
