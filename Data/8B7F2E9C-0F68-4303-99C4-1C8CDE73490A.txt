Abstract 
As the improvement of medical technology, 
aging societies become normal all over the world, 
and that is to say proportion of senior citizens is 
getting higher. Therefore, medical health care 
becomes the most important topic for study in 
twenty first century. Among them, home health 
care system including real-time monitoring is the 
very issue worth to be researched. Here, so-called 
medical real-time healthy monitoring is a system 
to accurately extract the slight changes of 
important chemical elements in human body 
because these changes in human body will cause 
serious influence on human health. In this 
integrated project, we use the technique 
correlated with semiconductor to fabricate the 
sensing devices and plat-forms for detecting 
chemical substance including pH value, sodium 
ion concentration and potassium ion 
concentration correlated with human health in 
blood with standard solutions firstly.  
 In our results, the HfO2 material as hydrogen 
sensing membrane was successfully developed 
with high sensitivity (55 mV/pH) and high 
selectivity (>10-2 in Na+ and K+). The CF4 
plasma treatment for improving the sensitivity of 
sodium ion and potassium ion on HfO2 sensing 
membrane was successfully developed. The HfO2 
membrane with CF4 plasma treatment has higher 
sensitivity of sodium ion (24.19 mV/pK) and

B. Test Solutions and Measurement Setup 
To investigate the pH sensing properties, the 
standard hydrogen buffer solutions (Merck) were 
prepared with pH range from 2 to 12. For 
detection of sodium and potassium ions, 5 mM 
Tris/HCl was prepared as buffer electrolyte 
which the pH value was kept at 8.2. The 
concentrations of sodium and potassium ions in a 
range between 10-5 and 10-1 M were controlled 
with injecting of 0.1 M NaCl/Tris (0.1 M 
KCl/Tris) and 1 M NaCl/Tris (1 M KCl/Tris) into 
buffer electrolyte by micropipette. In order to 
obtain the stable pNa and pK responses, all 
ISFETs were immersed in the 5 mM Tris/HCl for 
12 h before measurement. To get the sensing 
properties of hydrogen, sodium and potassium 
ion, constant voltage-constant current (CVCC) 
circuit was used to collect the response voltage. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
The hydrogen sensing voltage of HfO2 ISFET 
and Si3N4 ISFETs were obtained from output 
signal of CVCC circuit as shown in Fig. 2. Both 
materials show quasi-nernstian pH response in 
pH region between pH 2 and pH 12. pH 
sensitivities of HfO2 ISFET and Si3N4 ISFET 
extracted by linear fitting are 55 mV/pH and 48 
mV/pH, respectively. Linearity of two fitting 
curves are both higher than 99 %.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The first ion sensitive field-effect transistor 
(ISFET) with SiO2 gate as sensing material for 
bio-medical applications was invented by P. 
Bergveld in 1970 [1]. Due to the small size, low 
input impedance, high output impedance, 
solid-state structure, compatible with CMOS 
technology and multi ion sensing capability, the 
ISFET is a very promising device for in vivo 
monitoring of ion activity in biomedical samples. 
The concentrations of potassium and sodium ions 
detection is one of interest of biomedical 
application research. In past years, there are 
many different kinds of methods to alter the 
sensitivity or selectivity of sensing materials, 
such as polymeric, ion-implantation, or 
electrochemically sensitive layer. [2]-[4] 
However, there are still some instable problems 
in these methods, such as the adhesion problem 
for extra electrochemically or polymeric sensitive 
membrane, damage problem for implantation and 
lifetime problem for all methods. Recent year, 
hafnium oxide (HfO2) which owns high 
sensitivity, low drift and compatible process with 
CMOS technology was proposed as the 
promising sensing material for pH detection 
[5]-[6]. However, for multiple ion sensing 
application in biomedical region, HfO2 exhibits 
low capability due to low sensitivity and 
selectivity for potassium and sodium ions 
detection.  
In this study, the inorganic method for 
improving the sensitivity and selectivity of 
potassium ion and sodium ion on single layer 
HfO2 ISFET was proposed.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
 
ISFET structure fabrication 
 In order to investigate the sensing properties of 
sodium and potassium ions, the HfO2 ISFET and 
HfO2 with CF4 plasma ISFET structures were all 
fabricated at Institute of Electron Technology 
(IET), Poland. Figure 1 was shown the schematic 
of single layer HfO2 ISFET with CF4 plasma 
surface treatment.  
 
 
Fig. 1 The schematic of single layer HfO2 ISFET 
with CF4 plasma surface treatment. 
 
N-type (100) silicon wafer was used as starting 
substrate material. P-well isolation for active 
areas was firstly formed to obtain the immunity 
on crosstalk between chips. Extended 
source/drain areas were designed to obtain 
sufficient separation between the contact holes 
and the sensing areas for easy encapsulation, but 
with a drawback of high series resistance. Then a 
HfO2 layer (150 Å) was deposited by reactive 
radio frequency (r.f.) sputtering after standard 
titration curves of single layer HfO2 ISFET with 
CF4 plasma surface treatment. 
 
In Fig. 3, the response of potassium ion and 
sodium ion are shown the slight change in the 
concentration above 10-3 M of single layer HfO2 
ISFET. It was indicated the single layer HfO2 
ISFET presented lower pK and pNa sensitivity. 
In Fig. 4, the response of potassium ion and 
sodium ion are shown the obviously increased 
change in the concentration above 10-3 M of 
single layer HfO2 ISFET with CF4 plasma surface 
treatment. 
For clear illustration on sodium and potassium 
sensing behaviors, the voltages were extracted 
from the end point of every titration measurement 
step as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for single layer 
HfO2 ISFET with and without CF4 plasma 
surface treatment, respectively. In Fig. 5, the 
same ion sensitivity with 9.1 mV/pX (X = Na and 
K) in the concentration range between 10-3 M and 
10-1 M of potassium and sodium ions were 
observed before plasma treatment. In Fig.6, to 
compare the sensing properties of potassium ion 
and sodium ion with the sample without CF4 
plasma treatment, the pK and pNa were 
calculated in the concentration range between 
10-3 M and 10-1 M. It was shown that the 
obtained sensitivity of potassium ion (24.19 
mV/pK) and sodium ion (36.44 mV/pNa) were 
become larger with surface plasma treatment. 
Beside that, the samples with plasma treatment 
are also shown high sensitivity in the 
concentration range between 10-4 M and 10-3 M. 
The sensitivity of potassium ion is 18.69 mV/pK 
and the sensitivity of sodium ion is 27.65 
mV/pNa in the concentration range between 10-4 
M and 10-1 M. Both of these two values are 
higher than samples without plasma treatment. 
Therefore, the selectivity of the single layer HfO2 
ISFET with CF4 plasma surface treatment is 
larger than the single layer HfO2 ISFET without 
plasma treatment.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this study, the inorganic method with CF4 
plasma surface treatment for improving the 
sensitivity and selectivity of sodium ion and 
potassium ion detection on single layer HfO2 
ISFET was proposed firstly. With CF4 surface 
plasma treatment on sensing membrane, the 
single layer HfO2 ISFET exhibits higher pK and 
pNa sensitivity and large concentration range for 
on single and stacked layer structures were used 
as the sensing membrane of LAPS. The single 
layer sensing membrane has been used for the 
EIS structure, and it showed the benefit as low 
cost and easy fabrication. To optimize the sensing 
performance, post rapid thermal annealing was 
used on both structures. For the test of stability, 
drift and hysteresis were investigated, too. [3] 
 
EXPERIMENT 
Device fabrication 
The detail fabrication flow was shown in Fig. 
1. To fabricate the LAPS with single and stacked 
layer structure, 45 nm silicon dioxide was 
thermally grown on the p-type silicon wafer only 
for the stacked layer structure. After that, 35 nm 
HfO2 layer was deposited on both structures by 
radio frequency (rf) reactive sputter. To optimize 
the sensing properties, RTA post treatments with 
500, 700, 900oC were used on both structures. A 
300 nm aluminum layer was deposited on the 
back-side by thermal evaporator, and then 
partially removed by wet etching after a 
lithography process to open a window for the 
light source. The size of chips were cut into 
15×15 mm2 and casted on a PVC board to 
enhance the rigidity and protect the contact line. 
Finally, the LAPS chip was placed into a 
designed holder for well protection from the 
electrolyte.

Measurement setup 
The schematic of the LAPS system was 
shown in Fig. 2. The IR-LEDs were chosen for 
the light source and were shined with a ac 
frequency as 1 kHz. The LAPS system was 
consist with a transimpedance amplifier and band 
pass filter combined with a multiplexer to control 
the LEDs array. After applying a dc-bias voltage, 
the resulting photocurrent of the LAPS structure 
is measured with a transimpedance amplifier. The 
signal is filtered by a narrowband filter 
afterwards. A data acquisition card from National 
Instruments is used to digitize the measurement 
values. A PC with a LabVIEW software stores 
the measurement values and calculates controller 
actions for the CC-mode measurement. [4-5] 
For the investigation of sensing properties, 
the LAPS samples were measured in pH 2 to pH 
12 buffer solutions. To test the long term stability, 
the samples were continuously monitoring in pH 
7 buffer solution for 12 hours.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
    All samples were measured based on a 16 
channel holder and measurement circuit. The 
basic photo current to voltage (I-V) curve of 
single and stacked layer LAPS were shown in Fig. 
3 (a) and (b). The curves of the photo current 
shifted with the various pH values for the buffer 
solutions. And the pH sensitivity can be 
calculated from the corresponding voltage as 
shown in Fig. 4. 
In Fig. 5, for all conditions of single layer 
For the long term stability, the LAPS 
sample was continuous monitoring in pH 7 for 12 
hours. The drift coefficient for the stacked layer 
HfO2 LAPS was shown in Fig. 7. The drift 
coefficient was 0.22 mV/h. It is quite low and 
suitable for a stable sensing application.

CONCLUSION 
    In this study, single and stacked HfO2 layer 
was used for the sensing membrane of LAPS. 
The higher pH sensitivity was observed on the 
single layer LAPS, it might be caused by the 
hysteresis effect. After post RTA treatment, the 
pH sensitivity of both structures were improved 
to around 58 to 63 mV/pH. For the test of long 
term stability, low drift coefficient as 0.22 mV/h 
was performed on the stacked layer LAPS.
