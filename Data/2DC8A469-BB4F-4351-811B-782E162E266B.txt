英文摘要 
 
Low dielectric constant polyetherimides have been synthesized by incorporating a 
bisphenol A dianhydride, BPADA, and 2,7-bis(4-aminophenoxy) naphthalene (BAPN), a 
phenylene ether diamine. The flexible ether and larger planar naphthalene structure of BAPN 
led to more spacing between polymer molecules, resulting in less efficient chain packing and 
an increase in the free volume, thus decreasing the dielectric constant. New PEI/silica hybrid 
nanocomposites were prepared from this novel polyetherimide via sol-gel process. The 
dielectric constants were further decreased with the incorporation of silica. These synthesized 
PEI and nanocomposites have high thermal stability and good mechanical properties.

[APrTEOS], and 3-glycidyloxy propyl trimethoxy silane [GPTMOS] were purchased from 
Acros. The solvents, N-methyl- 2-pyrrolidone [NMP] and toluene (Tedia) were used as 
received. 
 
2.2 特性分析： 
Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-40 
spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were performed on a Bruker AMX-400 spectrometer with 
THF-d8 as the solvent. 29Si solid state NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker Avance-400 
spectrometer. The dielectric properties of the polymer films were tested by the Agilent 4284A 
LCR meter with 16451B dielectric test fixture at 1 MHz frequency. The 16451B employs the 
parallel plate method, which sandwiches the material between two stainless steel electrodes to 
form a capacitor. LCR meter is then used to measure the capacitance created from the fixture. 
The measurements were performed on 0.10-0.12 mm thick, 50 mm diameter polymer films, 
which were desiccated overnight prior to measurement and were run at room temperature at 
50% RH according to ASTM D150. At least five individual determinations were used to 
calculate the average dielectric constant, with an accuracy of ±0.10. Thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA) was performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA at a heating rate of 20 oC /min 
in N2. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data were obtained from a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 
Diamond DSC. Samples were scanned at a heating rate of 10 oC /min under N2. The Tg values 
were measured as the change of the specific heat in the heat flow curves. X-ray diffractograms 
(XRD) were obtained at room temperature on a Rigaku RINT 2000, using Ni-filtered CuKα 
radiation (40 kV, 100 mA). The morphologies of the fracture surfaces of hybrid materials were 
observed with a JEOL JSM-6700 scanning electron microscope. The samples for TEM study 
were examined with a Hitachi TEM H-7500 using an acceleration voltage of 100 KV. 
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy image of silicon element mapping was recorded 
on a Hitachi S-4100 microscopy. An Instron universal tester model 4467 was used to study the 
stress-strain behavior. 
  
2.3 PREPARATION OF THE PEI AND PEI/SILICA NANOCOMPOSITES 
 
2.3.1 Synthesis of polyamic acid (PAA) and PEI 
 
PEI was synthesized by reacting diamine with dianhydrides as illustrated in Scheme 1. Diamine 
BAPN 3.42 g (0.01 mol) and NMP 29.4 g were placed into a 250-mL three-neck flask under 
nitrogen purge. The mixture was stirred until the solution was clear. Equal molar (0.01 mol) of 
dianhydrides, BPADA and 6FDA in various ratios, were added to the diamine solution to make 
a solution with a 20% solid content.  The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at 60 oC and 
produced a transparent, yellow, viscous solution of PAA. Other PAAs in this study (with 
various diamines) were prepared by a similar procedure. 
 The PAA solutions were spread on a glass plate using a spin-coater to control the film 
thickness.  The films were thermally dried at 60 oC for 4 h to remove most of the solvent in a 
forced air oven. The PAA films were imidized to PEI by heating to 100 oC, 150oC, 200oC at 1 h 
each, and 250oC for another hour to achieve fully imidization. The PEI films were then cooled 
to room temperature, soaked in water, and stripped from the glass. 
 
  The hybrid PAA solution was spread on a glass plate using a spin-coater to obtain a PAA 
hybrid film. The thermal imidization procedures were the same as mentioned above for PEI 
films. After drying the aforementioned films at 110 oC for 24 h in vacuum, the PEI/silica hybrid 
films were obtained.

2.3.3 Preparation of the nanocomposites from soluble PEI 
 For a soluble polyetherimide, the nanocomposite can also be prepared utilizing a novel 
sol-gel process after chemical imidization [9]. GPTMOS was charged into a PEI solution and 
stirred at 70oC for 24 h to complete the reaction.  Then, the acidic hydrolyzed TEOS solution 
was added and stirred for 6 h to produce a hybrid solution (see Scheme 2, right). The rest of the 
steps are the same as the procedure described above.

3.2 THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURE ON DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES 
   Basic understanding of influence of molecular structure on dielectric properties of polymer 
provides guidance on the engineering of appropriate electric insulating materials [15]. The 
chemical structure can affect the dielectric properties of polyimide [16-17]. The dielectric 
constants of PEI/silica nanocomposite films prepared by synthesis BPADA with mPDA or 
pPDA are shown in Figure 4. The dielectric constant decreased with increasing amounts of 
silica. The decreased dielectric constants may be attributed to the reduction in the freedom of 
orientation of the silica and main-chain flexibility of the PEI matrix [8]. The dielectric constant 
for pPEI is slightly higher than that of mPEI. This is caused by the better dielectric behavior 
associated with pPEI [3].

Correlation between high free volume and low dielectric constant has been previously 
reported for polyimides [18]. The introduction of free volume in a polymer decreases the 
number of polarizable groups per unit volume, resulting in lower values for ε. Free volume in 
polyimides have been enhanced by the addition of pendant groups, flexible bridging units, and 
bulky groups which limit chain packing density. The incorporation of fluorine into polyimides 
has been shown to lower dielectric constants due to a combination of lower electronic 
polarizability and larger free volume [6]. 
 To decrease the dielectric constant of PEI, we incorporated 6FDA as one of the 
dianhydride monomers. 6FDA may decrease the dielectric constant by the bulky CF3 groups 
that decrease chain packing efficiency and increase free volume, and by the strong 
electronegativity of fluorine that creates permanent dipole moments in CF3 groups [19]. To 
further reduce the dielectric constants of PEIs, we increased free volume by replacing 
phenylene diamine with phenylene ether diamines, including ODA, pBAB, BAPP, and BAPN.

3.3 PREPARATION OF THE PEI/SILICA NANOCOMPOSITES WITH LOW ε 
 We had studied the preparation of PEI nanocomposites by intercalation of polymers with 
clay [22]. The thermal properties of PEI-clay nanocomposites improved over pristine PEI, but 
the physical test results showed that the films became brittle as the organoclay content 
increased over 2%. This indicated that the organoclay was not suitable for the preparation of 
the PEI nanocomposites. On the other hand, PEI nanocomposites with improved thermal, 
mechanical and dielectric properties were successfully prepared via a sol-gel process [22]. 
 In this article, we follow the recent findings in our lab that the PEI synthesized by BPADA 
dianhydride and BAPN diamine has a lower dielectric constant, to prepare the new PEI/silica 
hybrid nanocomposites via the sol-gel process.

 The experimental conditions for preparing PEI/silica hybrids are listed in Table 2. The 
amount of coupling agent and hydrolyzed TEOS solution used varied with the SiO2 content.  
 The morphology of the PEI/silica nanocomposites was examined by XRD, SEM, and 
TEM. XRD showed no peak, indicating an amorphous polymer structure for these PEI 
nanocomposites. The SEM of the fracture surfaces showed a finely interconnected or 
co-continuous phase for PEI nanocomposite PN10 (Figure 6). This image elucidates that the 
coupling agent improved the miscibility between polymer and silica phases in hybrid 
nanocomposite. From the TEM of PN10, one can see that the shape of the included silica 
particles is round and the particle sizes within the hybrid films is ＜100 nm (Figure 7). Figure

The Tg of hybrids increased gradually with increasing silica content. This increase can be 
attributed to the strong interaction between the organic polymer matrix and the inorganic silica 
that increased the restricting strength of silica on PEI molecules [8]. However, at higher SiO2 
content, Tg started to decrease slightly due to microphase separation. The thermal 
decomposition temperatures at 10% weight loss (Td,10%) in nitrogen (Table 2) had similar trends 
as Tg. Td,10% increased gradually with increasing silica content, but decreased at higher SiO2 
content. This may result from the Si–OH   residual groups (formed through the hydrolysis of 
TEOS and APrTEOS), which increases with the silica content due to the incomplete 
condensation reaction in nanocomposites [23]. Nevertheless, Td,10% values above 550 oC 
indicate that the PEI/silica nanocomposites have a high thermal stability. 
 As we have discussed, the dielectric constant decreased with increasing amounts of silica. 
However, at higher silica content (more than 10%), the aggregation of silica resulted in the 
increase of the dielectric constant. 
 
 
4. 結論 
 
Polyetherimides (PEIs) with low dielectric constants have been synthesized by incorporating 
fluorinated dianhydride and phenylene ether diamines, such as BAPN. The dielectric constant 
of PEI decreased with increasing amounts of 6FDA content and phenylene ether units. Besides 
the contribution of fluorine to lower dielectric constants, the decrease in the dielectric constant 
is mainly due to the flexible and large planar chemical structure of BAPN diamine, which 
increased the free volume of polymer. PEI nanocomposites with improved thermal, mechanical, 
and dielectric properties were prepared via the sol-gel process from PEI synthesized by BPADA 
with BAPN. The dielectric constants were decreased with the incorporation of silica. The 
synthesized PEI and nanocomposite films have high thermal stability and good mechanical 
properties. Thus, these polymer nanocomposites may be candidates for high-performance 
microelectronic applications.
