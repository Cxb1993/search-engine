傳統陰極射線管(CRT)和穿透型液晶顯示器(LCD)而言，電子紙顯示器利用周圍光源作為閱

2anti-reflection treatment may be better suited for graphics, gaming, and multimedia applications–
like watching DVDs. These two kinds of treatment are taken into account in the design of
electronic paper screens, and our preliminary ergonomic evaluations of anti-reflection and
anti-glare treatments (Lin et al., 2008a; Lin et al., 2008b) show that in the series of anti-reflection
(AR), the better but more-expensive surface treatment (0.8% AR) improved the legibility and
reduced visual fatigue significantly. In the series of anti-glare (AG), 7.5% haze (AG) and 43 %
haze (AG) have the same performance in search time and visual fatigue rating experiments. Thus,
a manufacture can choose a cheaper one for cost effective purpose. Based on these rudimentary
findings, further integrated evaluation of anti-reflection and antiglare treatments on legibility and
visual fatigue is still needed to provide more complete information for use in overall design
decisions. More recently, the compound treatment of anti-reflection and anti-glare is developed
and expected to possess even higher performance. The practical function of these surface
treatments in ergonomic considerations needs to be further evaluated.
Omodani (2004) indicated that paper-like readability should be accepted as the most
important target of electronic papers. Therefore, some impressive and unique characteristics of
electronic paper including flexible property and high background reflectance are gradually
developed. Flexible property represents the bending degree of display. On the other hand,
reflectance is the ability to reflect light (Henzen and van de Kamer, 2006). The ideal surface that
reflects all incident light has a reflectance value of 100%. Normal printer paper reflects up to
80% of the incident light, and thus has a reflectance of 80%. Since many electronic paper
manufacturers make efforts to improve their products to be close to original papers, some
suggestion and ergonomic evaluation for these manufacturing parameters are necessary and
important. In addition, it is also important to consider the requirements from different ages of
users in product design stage.
With regard to user aspect, ambient illumination is a critical issue when using electronic
paper display. There have been numerous researches concerning effect of ambient illumination
on visual performance using VDT with backlight. However, so far the research of electronic
papers relating illumination effects is still critically lacking. Sanders and McCormick (1993)
especially indicated that lighting would be expected to have a greater effect on a reading work.
While electronic papers were read in a wide range of illumination, investigation on ambient
lighting certainly becomes very important.
Consequently, the present study is intended to investigate these critical factors from both
manufacturing and user sides. It is expected to combine manufacturing development of electronic
papers with ergonomic consideration, and provide integrated evaluation for related e-paper
products. In addition, users can take useful information when they use related products as well.
1.2 Objectives
This research aims to evaluate critical factors of electronic paper on both manufacturing and
user sides, and improves the performance of human-machine interactions. As aspect of
manufacturing side, this study focuses on surface treatment, flexible parameter setting, and
background reflectance. In addition, users’ age efects on manufacturing parameter seting (e.g.

6anti-reflection (AR) and anti-glare (AG) are widely applied on the front surface of a display to
reduce surface reflection and minimize glare. Integrated evaluation of these two treatments is
important for manufacturers. More recently, the compound treatment of anti-reflection and
anti-glare is developed and expected to possess even higher performance. Although this kind of
treatments may seem superior in all facets, the practical function in ergonomic considerations
needs to be further evaluated.
2.1.2 Background reflectance of reflective-type display
Paper-like readability provides electronic paper with the characteristic of comfortable
reading, and it should be positioned as the most important target (Omodani, 2004). The high
value of background reflectance is one of the most conspicuous properties of original paper.
Matsumoto and Shinozaki (2002) proposed that the reflectance of paper-like images should
exceed 60%. However, current reflectance values of electronic paper lie about 20% for various
LCD-based systems, about 40% for electrophoretic, and about 60% for electrochrome (Henzen
and van de Kamer, 2006). In more recent years, many electronic paper manufacturers make
efforts to improve background reflectance to be close to original papers. Henzen and van de
Kamer (2006) also indicated that reflectance of electronic paper is one of the improvements.
Enhancing the reflectance to the same level as original papers (about 80%) is expected to be
implemented in the future. With the rapid growth in display technology for electronic paper, the
effect of background reflectance on legibility and visual fatigue has gathered considerable
concerns and needs further investigations.
2.1.3 Flexible display
The industry of flexible display has been developing rapidly in recent years. One of the
important applications for flexible display is electronic paper. Some limits of computer monitors
have been overcome by electronic paper, such as paper-like readability and flexibility (Omodani,
2004). Flexibility is an important property which means that electronic paper can be rolled for a
bending radius or an angle, and therefore numerous technologies for flexible electronic paper
have recently been developed and evaluated (Grego et al., 2005; Huitema et al., 2005). This kind
of technology carries out the possibility that electronic papers can be rolled up just like regular
office papers. Henzen and van de Kamer (2006) indicated that fragility is a key issue for
electronic paper as a result of their mobile use, and flexibility will alleviate this issue
considerably. Although thus far flexible electronic paper has appeared mainly in the prototype or
research state, the results are good enough to expect commercial products within 5 years (Henzen
and van de Kamer, 2006). Because display technology for flexible electronic paper has made
great progress, the effects of a bending surface on legibility and visual fatigue have gathered
considerable concern.
2.1.4 Product design with users’ age consideration
Since the information-oriented society encompasses the elderly, it is important to consider
the vision of aged people when developing display devices (Kubota, 1998). In general, the visual
8of the retina or the optic nerve. Dillon and Emurian (1996) showed that accommodation power
represents the functions of the ciliary muscles that sharpen the image on the retina and the change
of accommodation power is treated as visual fatigue symptom. Secondly, other methods employ a
general visual task to evaluate performance (Wright et al., 1999). There are a variety of methods
for visual task design. An approach referred to as the letter-search task performed on pseudo-texts
is considered an effective way to assess legibility (Boschman and Roufs, 1997; Roufs and
Boschman, 1997). Thirdly, some methods involve the use of subjective measures based on
questionnaires or interviews after the experiments (Kubota, 1998; Shieh, 2000; Shieh and Chen,
1997). The assessment of electronic paper in the present study focused on legibility and visual
fatigue. Legibility was evaluated from the search time and accuracy after search tasks, and visual
fatigue was evaluated from the change in CFF, the change of accommodation time in near point
of convergence (NPC) and subjective questionnaires.
10
In the design of the experiment, illumination level and radius of curvature served as
between-subject factors, and surface treatment served as a within-subject factor. Each subject
completed the letter-search task using three different surface treatments in the condition of certain
combinations of illumination and radius of curvature.
3.1.1.2 Simulation method
There is still no commercial flexible-technology product on the market. Since flexible
e-paper is not available, we used a simulated flexible e-paper display, the reflective-type
characteristics of which were based on Kubota (1998), so the validity of this reflective-type
display simulation has already been verified in previous studies (Kubota, 1996a, 1996b). In this
study, we focus on an e-paper display based on electrophoretic electronic ink (e-ink) technology.
E-ink is comprised of millions of tiny microcapsules, in which a mixture of positively charged
white particles and negatively charged black particles are suspended in fluid. The
black-and-white image is presented by applying an external electronic field to attract the charged
particles to the surface according to their polarity (Wang et al., 2008). Based on this technology,
the black-and-white image will attain nearly paper-like readability. For this study, we laminated
the surface treatment to the printed image to simulate actual e-paper display presentation.
3.1.1.3 Subjects
The subjects were 12 female and 33 male college students. Their mean age was 24.18 years
with a standard deviation of 2.52 years. All subjects had 0.8 corrected visual acuity or better and
normal color vision. An OPTEC 2000 vision tester and Standard Pseudo-Isochromatic charts
were used to test the visual acuity and color vision of the subjects. Forty-five subjects were
randomly assigned to each of nine between-subject groups.
3.1.1.4 Measurements of legibility
A series of letter-search tasks were conducted to evaluate the legibility. Experimental
materials were composed of several paragraphs of pseudo-text designed with character strings of
different lengths and containing random capital letters and digits (Roufs and Boschman, 1997).
The overall configuration was quite similar to the normal text in the appearance, but it had no
contextual meaning. A paragraph of alpha-numeric pseudo-text with 12-point Thin Ming font
was used. The text was arranged in 19 lines, with 71 characters (including capital letters, spaces
and digits) per line. Three targets–the capital characters ‘A,’’ ‘‘X,’ and ‘Y’’ –were randomly
embedded in the pseudo-text, with a frequency range of 8–13. There were 2 pages in each
experimental combination, so this procedure simulated six pages of reading text. The sum of
target characters in each experimental combination was the same.
Subjects were instructed to scan the text and identify the target as accurately and as quickly
as possible. The search time and the number of targets which the subject found were individually
recorded after each letter-search task. The search time and accuracy were used to assess legibility.
Each subject completed several training trials in order to become familiar with the whole process
before the formal experiment. After each experimental combination, the subject took a rest to
12
The CFF value was measured with a NEITZ Handy Flicker (HF). In order to reduce mental
workload, subjects used a Baqi HK-102A counter to record when they identified the target letters.
The experimental task configuration is shown in Fig. 3. The simulated electronic paper was
set on a table 73 cm in height, and the center of the simulated electronic paper was 10 cm higher
than the table and 36 cm from the front edge of the table with respect to the horizontal axis. A
chinrest was used to maintain the subject’shead at 25 cm above the table and to fix the viewing
distance at 50 cm. The inclination angle of the simulated electronic paper was 105° with respect
to the vertical axis, which was recommended for workplace design by Turville et al. (1998). The
seat was adjustable so subjects could make themselves comfortable.

3.1.1.7 Data collection and analysis
The four dependent variables collected from the letter-search tasks were search time and
accuracy (for legibility) and the change in CFF and scores from the subjective questionnaire (for
visual fatigue). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the dependent measures with α 
= 0.05, and Duncan’s multiple range test was used to test the diferences among the levels of the 
dependent measures. All calculations were computed using the Statistical Products and Services
Solution (SPSS).
3.1.2 Results
3.1.2.1 Search time
The results of ANOVA for search time are shown in Table 1. The ANOVA indicated that
surface treatment had a significant effect on search time (F(2,72) = 9.287, p <0.01) and that
ambient illumination significantly influenced the search time (F(2,36) = 6.478, p< 0.01).
However, curvature and all interactions among surface treatment, illumination and curvature had
no significant impacts on search time. Table 2 presents the mean search time for each
independent variable. Two significant factors–surface treatment and illumination–were further
analyzed by Duncan’s multiple range test(Table 2). With the surface treatments of transparency,
0.8% AR, and 43% haze, the mean search times were 847.78 s, 789.80 s, and 763.71 s,

3.1.2.3 The change of CFF
The results of ANOVA for the change of CFF are summarized in Table 4, which reveals a
significant main effect for surface treatment (F(2,72) = 11.853, p < 0.01). However, no
significant main effect for illumination or curvature and no significant interaction effects were
found through the statistical analysis. Table 5 presents the mean change in CFF under each level
of the independent variables. In general, a smaller change in CFF corresponded to less visual
fatigue. To provide a more accurate distinction, Duncan’s multiple range test was employed to 
examine the differences in the significant factor levels. For the surface treatments of transparency,
0.8% AR, and 43% haze, the mean changes in CFF were -1.56 Hz, -0.92 Hz, and -0.68 Hz,
respectively. The results of Duncan’s multiple range test (Table 5) reflectthat surface treatment
with anti-reflection (0.8% AR) or anti-glare (43% haze) significantly produced less visual fatigue
than transparency (non-treatment) did.

3.1.3. Discussion and summary of conclusion
3.1.3.1 Legibility of simulated electronic paper
Two critical indexes –search time and accuracy –were used to evaluate legibility. The
statistical results revealed that none of the independent variables (i.e., surface treatment, ambient
illumination, and curvature of display) had significant impact on search accuracy results which
appear to be generally compatible with those of Boschman and Roufs (1997), who found that
accuracy was not a sensitive performance measure in letter-search tasks. The fact that subjects
were likely to have paid more attention to their accuracy because of the reward policy, and may
have slowed their search speed to attain a better performance on accuracy, may explain why the
data of accuracy under each level of independent variable were so close and high, and why no
significant factor appeared through the statistical analysis. Since subjects kept their accuracy at
high levels, the effects of the independent variable on legibility were highlighted only by the
search speed.
Surface treatment was one of the factors which significantly influenced subjects’ search 
speed. Search time with the anti-glare treatment was generally shorter than that with transparency.
18
anti-reflection treatment over anti-glare treatment are simply the result of using a smooth
high-gloss surface. This kind of high-gloss surface on anti-reflection treatment allows the light
from an image to be directly transmited to the viewer’s eye,without being diffused. However,
the present study provided a more detailed ergonomic comparison for these two types of
treatment. The 43% haze anti-glare treatment may have provided good vision quality for a
reading task on simulated electronic papers, but it sacrificed some image quality, and subjects
still felt the same degree of visual fatigue with these two treatments in both the physiological and
the psychological indexes.
Ambient illumination was not a significant factor in the change in CFF; however, it
significantly affected subjective visual fatigue. This difference in the physiological and
psychological indexes may be because subjects felt uncomfortable with the direct/reflected light
of the harsh illumination (e.g., 8000 lux) and slowed their search speed in order to avoid excess
visual fatigue. In this situation, visual fatigue in the physiological index would not be obvious,
but would be more significant in the psychological index. In addition, previous studies
concerning visual fatigue have revealed that subjective rating scales can be more sensitive than
objective measurements (Hwang et al., 1988; Saito et al., 1994), so this may also explain the
differences between the psychological and physiological indexes. The results of the subjective
measure showed that it induced more visual fatigue in the 8000 lux illumination than in the 200
lux or 1500 lux illumination. Even though special treatment was applied to the screen surface,
light that was too harsh still brought about a direct/reflected glare effect and increased visual
fatigue. Kroemer and Grandjean (1997) indicated that sharp light contributed to the screen
reflection, which might produce visual fatigue. Hence, proper ambient illumination should be
available to avoid excess visual fatigue (Taptagaporn and Saito, 1990), especially when reading
on a portable device like electronic paper.
Changing the bending curvature (±10 cm) had no impact on either index of visual fatigue.
The bending degree may not have been large enough to influence the image quality: subjects
reported the same visual fatigue whether they were seeing a bent surface or a plane.
3.1.3.3 Application for design of electronic papers
As the technology of surface treatment advances, electronic paper manufacturers have the
option of purchasing anti-reflection or anti-glare treatments for their product screens.
Anti-reflection treatments, which can reduce ambient light reflection without sacrificing any
image quality, have attracted considerable attention. However, electronic paper manufacturers
also take cost into account when choosing the surface treatment, and anti-reflection treatment is
generally 10 times as expensive as anti-glare treatment. As a result, electronic paper
manufacturers usually face a trade-off between better visual quality and lower production cost.
The present study compares these two types of surface treatments for their ergonomic effects. On
the whole, the anti-glare treatment (e.g., 43% haze) performs better in terms of legibility and can
reduce visual fatigue at about the same rate as anti-reflection treatments (e.g., 0.8% AR). Thus,
electronic paper manufacturers should choose the treatment with 43% haze, despite its slight loss
of image quality. From the cost-benefit point of view, choosing this anti-glare treatment can help
20
3.2 Stage 2－Surface treatment, reflectance, and age effects on electronic-paper reading
performance
Based on the findings of stage 1, 0.8% AR and 43% haze (AG) exhibited the same utility to
reduce visual fatigue. More recently, the compound treatment of anti-reflection and anti-glare is
developed and expected to possess even higher performance. Although this compound surface
treatment seems superior in all facets, it is essential to evaluate its utility in detailed ergonomic
consideration.
On the other hand, the high value of background reflectance is one of the most conspicuous
properties of original paper. Up to now, there were several explorations concerning reflectance
based on existing e-readers. Wang et al. (2008) compared users’reading performance on three
reflective-type displays including electrophoretic electronic ink display (Sony LIBRIe’,
reflectance: 35%), cholesteric liquid crystal display (Kolin i-library, reflectance: 27%), and
conventional LCD under reflective mode (HP iPAQ hx 4700, reflectance: 12%). They pointed
out that the worse visual performance on the conventional LCD under reflective mode was due to
the lower background reflectance of display. As the promotion of display technology, current
reflectance values of electronic paper lie about 20% for various LCD-based systems, about 40%
for electrophoretic, and about 60% for electrochrome (Henzen and van de Kamer, 2006).
Moreover, many electronic paper manufacturers recently make efforts to improve background
reflectance to be close to original papers (about 80%). In this stage, we extended the scope of
reflectance factor based on the simulated e-paper display, and investigated the practical utility of
high value of background reflectance.
Since the information-oriented society encompasses the elderly, it is important to consider
the vision of aged people when developing display devices (Kubota, 1998). The legibility and
visual fatigue of users of different ages are worthy to be further evaluated to provide electronic
paper manufacturers with useful information. Consequently, practical utility of compound
treatment, high value of background reflectance was the main issue in this stage. In order to
understand the demands of different ages of users, not only the young but also the elderly were
included as research focuses.
3.2.1 Method
3.2.1.1 Experimental layout
In this stage, three independent variables were evaluated: (a) surface treatment, (b)
reflectance, and (c) users’ age. Four types of surface treatment including transparency
(non-treatment), anti-reflection (0.8% AR), antiglare (43% haze), and a compound of
anti-reflection and anti-glare (ARC) were taken into account. They were laminated to the printing
image and served as the visual display unit (VDU). Anti-reflection, anti-glare, and the compound
surface treatments were ARC4 type, AG 150 type ("Treatment Specification from Nitto
Website," 2008), and ARC type ("Treatment Specification from Nitto Website," 2008), provided
by Nitto Denko Corp. Three reflectances of printing paper, 33%, 60%, and 82%, were selected in
this experiment, and the related reflectance after adding certain surface treatments is shown in
Table 8. The reflectance was calculated from the ratio of its reflected intensity to that of a diffuse
22
pseudo-text, and the number of each target character is 14–18. However, the total number of
target characters in each experimental combination was definitely the same.
Figure 4 An example of a pseudo-text in Chinese will be used in the experiment.
3.2.1.4 Experimental environment
The experiment was conducted in a complete dark laboratory. A color-assessment cabinet
(VeriVide CAC 120-5) with diffuse light of TL 84 (4000K) was used as the light source. The
experimental illumination was fixed at 1500 lux. The experimental configuration of the
workplace was totally the same as the stage 1 (see Fig. 3).
3.2.1.5 Experimental procedure and data collection
Two age groups including the young and the elderly were instructed to complete the
character-search tasks. During the experiment, they were requested to identify the target Chinese
characters as accurately and quickly as possible. There were four target characters in each
experimental combination and subjects needed to identify one specific target character at a time.
During the search procedure, subjects could press a counter (Baqi HK-102A) while they were
finding a specific target character. After the experiment, the total search time and the number of
target character subjects found were recorded. Legibility was evaluated by the search time and
the accuracy of search task.
On the other hand, three indices including the subjective questionnaire, the change of CFF,
and the change of accommodation time in NPC were collected for evaluation of visual fatigue.
For the subjective index, the questionnaire developed by Heuer et al. (1989) was employed again
in this stage (refer to Section 3.1.1.5). With regard to objective index, the change in CFF and the
change in accommodation time in NPC were taken into account. In the beginning and at the end
of the specific experimental combination, the CFF value of the subject was separately measured.
The difference between these two values was treated as the change of CFF. NEITZ Handy Flicker
(HF) was used to measure the CFF value. In the same way, accommodation time in NPC of the
subject was measured in the beginning and at the end of the experimental combination. A Kowa
Accommodo-Polyrecorder recorded the response time of the subject when the target switched
from a far to a near point of the eye. The change of accommodation time in NPC during the
experimental combination represented the degree of visual fatigue.

accuracy for 0.8% AR and 43% haze than for transparency. In respect of age, the mean values of
accuracy for the young and the elderly were 0.876 and 0.820. Since there were only two levels of
age factor, the results showed that the young received higher accuracy than the elderly did on the
character-search tasks.

Figure 6 Subjective visual fatigue as a function of surface treatment.
Table 12 summarizes the ANOVA results of the change of CFF and the change of
accommodation time in NPC. For the change in CFF, it showed a significant effect for surface
treatment [F(3,54) = 6.218, p < 0.01] and a significant effect on reflectance [F(1,18) = 5.231, p <
0.05]. Regarding the surface treatment, it revealed that while the surface treatments were
transparency, 0.8% AR, 43% haze, and ARC, the mean values of the change in CFF
were –1.44, –1.08, –1.04, and –0.66 Hz, respectively. In this dependent measure, the change in
CFF becomes smaller when the subjects felt less visual fatigue, and corresponded to the value
which was close to zero. The results of the LSD method demonstrated that the change in CFF on
ARC was significantly different from that on transparency (p < 0.01), 0.8% AR (p < 0.05), and
43% haze (p < 0.05). The other of pair comparisons (i.e., transparency vs. 0.8% AR, transparency
vs. 43% haze, 0.8% AR vs. 43% haze) were not significant. Hence, the visual fatigue of the
subject for ARC was less than that for 43% haze, 0.8% AR, and transparency. Regarding the
reflectance, it showed that while the reflectance was 33% and 60%, the mean values of the
change in CFF were–1.22 and–0.89 Hz, respectively. Therefore, the visual fatigue of the subject
for 60% was less than that for 33%.
The ANOVA results of the change in accommodation time in NPC indicated a significant
effect for surface treatment [F(3,54) = 15.769, p < 0.01], and a significant effect for reflectance
[F(1,18) = 53.068, p < 0.01]. The corresponding mean values of the change in accommodation
time in NPC on transparency, 0.8% AR, 43% haze, and ARC were 0.929, 0.587, 0.515, and 0.385
sec. The plot of the change of accommodation time in NPC as a function of surface treatment is
shown in Fig. 7. For this dependent measure, the larger change in accommodation time in NPC
meant that there was more visual fatigue produced. The results of further analysis of the LSD
method reflected that the change in accommodation time in NPC for transparency was
significantly different from that for 0.8% AR (p < 0.01), 43% haze (p < 0.01), and ARC (p <
0.01). Significant effects for the difference between 0.8% AR and ARC (p < 0.01) and 43% haze

3.2.2.3 ANOVA: Part 2
In Part 2 of the analysis, there were three levels of surface treatment (transparency, 0.8% AR,
and 43% haze). The reflectance of printing paper comprised three levels (33%, 60%, and 82%).
In the same way, two different age groups including the young and the elderly were taken into
account. Hence, this analysis was based on a 3 (surface treatment) × 3 (reflectance level) × 2
(age of users) factorial design. Similarly, surface treatment and reflectance were treated as
within-subject factors and the age of users was treated as a between-subject factor.
3.2.2.4 Results: Part 2
3.2.2.4.1 Legibility: Search time and accuracy
In this part of the analysis, the ANOVA results for search time and accuracy appear in Table
13. As an aspect of search time, the results indicated that surface treatment [F(2,36) = 5.840, p <
0.01] and reflectance [F(2,36) = 16.161, p < 0.01] had a significant impact on the search time.
Regarding the surface treatment, the mean values of the search time for transparency, 0.8% AR,
and 43% haze were 463.93, 438.48, and 445.15 sec, respectively. The results of the LSD method
showed that the search time for transparency was significantly different from that for 0.8% AR (p
< 0.01) and 43% haze (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between 0.8% AR
and 43% haze. It was found that the subjects including the young and the elderly had faster search
speeds for 0.8% AR and 43% haze than for transparency. Regarding the reflectance, the mean
values of search time for 33%, 60%, and 82% were 469.93, 439.58, and 438.05 sec, respectively.
Figure 8 presents the main effect of reflectance on search time. The results of the LSD method
demonstrated that the search time for 33% was significantly different from that for 60% (p < 0.01)
and 82% (p < 0.01). However, the search time for a reflectance of 60% and 82% were not
significantly different. Therefore, the subjects including the young and the elderly had faster
search speed for a reflectance of 60% and 82% than for 33%.
On the other hand, the ANOVA results of accuracy indicated that surface treatment [F(2,36)
= 5.742, p < 0.01] and age [F(1,18) = 4.836, p < 0.05] were the only two significant factors on
accuracy. While the surface treatments were transparency, 0.8% AR, and 43% haze, the mean
values of the accuracy were 0.826, 0.860, and 0.861, respectively. The results of the LSD method
reflected that the accuracy for transparency was significantly different from that for 0.8% AR (p
< 0.01) and 43% haze (p < 0.05). The difference in accuracy between 0.8% AR and 43% haze
was not significant. Therefore, subjects had better visual performance for 0.8% AR and 43% haze
than for transparency. In addition, the corresponding mean values of accuracy of the young and
the elderly were 0.872 and 0.826. The results showed that the young had better visual
performance than the elderly for the character-search tasks.

respectively. The plot of the score of subjective questionnaire as a function of reflectance is
shown in Fig. 9. The results of the LSD method indicated that there were significant differences
between 33% and 60% (p < 0.01), between 33% and 82% (p < 0.01), and between 60% and 82%
(p < 0.01). Therefore, the most-visual-fatigued subjects reported were for 33%, the next was for
60%, and the least-visual-fatigued subjects reflected was for 82%.

Figure 9 Subjective visual fatigue as a function of reflectance.
The ANOVA results of the change of CFF and the change of accommodation time in NPC
are summarized in Table 15. The ANOVA results of the change of CFF indicated that the main
effect of reflectance was significant [F(2,36) = 6.397, p < 0.01]. In addition, there was a
significant interaction between reflectance and age (R × A) [F(2,36) = 8.777, p < 0.01]. Figure
10 showed the diagram of reflectance × age interaction. The significant interaction necessitated
tests of simple main effect within the interaction. These results reflected that in the young group,
the difference among three levels of reflectance was significant [F(2,18) = 10.088, p < 0.01],

3.2.3 Discussion
3.2.3.1 Effects of surface treatment
Effects of four surface treatments on legibility and visual fatigue were evaluated and were
further compared in this study. In terms of legibility, the results showed that surface treatment
was a significant factor on search time and accuracy. The search time on the ARC, 0.8% AR, and
43% haze was shorter than that on the transparency. It implied that whether compound surface
treatment (ARC) or a single kind of surface treatment (0.8% AR, 43% haze) could improve the
legibility of the VDU. These findings were entirely consistent with those of Jeng et al. (2007) that
34
in this study. In terms of legibility, the results showed that reflectance had significant impacts on
search time. The search time on the reflectance of 82% and 60% was shorter than that on the
reflectance of 33%. One possible explanation for this was that a lower reflectance, such as 33%,
reduced contrast ratio of VDU and degraded the legibility. Therefore, subjects had slow search
speed for the reflectance of 33%. The findings were in line with previous studies concerning
background reflectance effect. Kubota (1996b) investigated the required reflectance for legible
reflective LCDs and indicated that the reflectance of the background should be higher than 35 or
40%. Jeng et al. (2004) also suggested that the background reflectance of electronic paper was
required to exceed 40% to achieve a satisfactory subjective preference. The results of present
study validated that a higher reflectance could improve legibility. Furthermore, the results
indicated that legibility on the reflectance of 60% was similar to that on 82%.
In terms of visual fatigue, reflectance was also a significant factor on psychological
(subjective questionnaire) and physiological (the change of CFF, the change of accommodation
time in NPC) indexes. The results of subjective questionnaire, the change of CFF in young group,
and the change of accommodation time in NPC indicated that the subject with the highest degree
of visual fatigue was for the reflectance of 33%, the next was for 60%, and the subject with the
least visual fatigue was for 82%. Therefore, the higher reflectance of printing paper, the lower
degree of visual fatigue the subjects reported. It implied that a reflectance of 82% which was
close to regular paper provided the best display quality to reduce visual fatigue. The results were
similar to the conclusions of Kubota (1998) that the higher background reflectance was needed to
attain sufficient subjective legibility and reduce visual fatigue when the search character was
smaller than 15 pt. Jeng et al. (2004) also indicated that visual performance was maximized when
the background reflectance exceeded 70%. Hence, the findings of this study demonstrated that
increasing the background reflectance could effectively reduce visual fatigue for electronic paper.
Because of the promotion of display technology, nowadays electronic-paper manufacturers
are making efforts to increase display reflectance to the same level as regular paper (about 80%).
In our study, we extended the scope of the reflectance factor, and the results showed that although
the reflectance of 82% and 60% exhibited the same legibility, the reflectance of 82% could
effectively reduce visual fatigue. As a result, we suggested that enhancing the reflectance of
electronic paper to the same level as regular paper was worthy to be practically implemented.
3.2.3.3 Effects of age
Effects of surface treatments and reflectance on legibility and visual fatigue in two age
groups were compared as well. As an aspect of surface treatment, the results showed that the
interactions of surface treatment and age (S × A) on all the measures of legibility and visual
fatigue were not significant. It meant that the young and the elderly groups had the same visual
performance trends for the different surface treatments. These findings were in accord with the
results of some previous studies. Sanders et al. (1990) found no relationship at all between age
and sensitivity to discomfort reflected glare. Other studies also indicated that the relationship
between discomfort glare from display reflection and age was rather weak (Sanders and
McCormick, 1993). The findings in this study showed that under a different degree of the display

3.3 Stage 3－Minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper
display
The biggest difference between the electronic-paper display and the traditional VDT (e.g.
cathode-ray tube (CRT), liquid-crystal display (LCD)) is the lighting source. The electronic-paper
display totally depends on the ambient light as its reading source, in comparison with the
conventional CRTs and transmissive-type LCDs which self-emit or transmit light. Hence,
traditional VDT whose screen emits light does not require ambient illumination in order to be
read. One can easily obtain information from the traditional VDT screen even in the complete
dark condition. On the contrary, we can not see anything from the reflective-type electronic-paper
display until there is lighting in the surroundings. Since the electronic-paper display is different
from other traditional displays, the ambient illumination is a critical issue when applying this
display technology to product design. A key issue then is the minimum ambient illumination
requirement at which human eyes find acceptable legibility from the electronic-paper display
without excess visual fatigue. This fundamental information is necessary for designers when they
expand this technology in other application areas in the future.
User’s age is another critical factor in VDT research because of the phenomenon of
presbyopia for people over 40 years of age (Yeow and Taylor, 1990). Since the
information-oriented society encompasses the elderly, it is important to consider the vision of
aged people when developing display devices (Kubota, 1998). In general, the visual faculties
gradually decline with age, especially for the people exceed 40 years old. Loss of elasticity of the
lens deteriorates near vision and makes the elderly people become farsighted. In addition, the
muscles controlling the diameter of the pupil begin to atrophy with age. This reduces the size of
the pupil and decreases the range and speed with which the pupil can adjust to differing levels of
illumination (Sanders and McCormick, 1993). Therefore, the retinal illumination actually
decreases by 66 percent from the age of 20 to 60 (Weale, 1961). Because the difference in visual
function of adjusting illumination, different age people must be considered when investigating
the minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper displays.
The objective of this stage tried to discover the minimum ambient illumination requirement
that human eyes get acceptable legibility from the real electronic-paper display. In order to
understand demands of different ages of users, not only the young but also the elderly were
included as research subjects.
3.3.1 Method
3.3.1.1 Experimental design
Since the objective of this paper is to discover the minimum ambient illumination
requirement for legible electronic-paper display, the illumination setting range must begin in very
low level. There were several pro-tests to evaluate the possible beginning illumination setting.
This beginning setting needs to satisfy the condition that the subjects can complete the visual
tasks. According to the pro-evaluation, 32 lux is finally decided as the beginning level in the
formal experiment. Ambient illumination and user’s age were two major independent variables.
There were seven levels in illumination setting: 32 lux, 43 lux, 52 lux, 62 lux, 71 lux, 82 lux, and
38
was 6.4 inch black-white screen. The dimensions of the E-book were 188 mm (Length) × 118
mm (Width) × 8.5 mm (Height), and the weight was 176 g. A photograph of this electronic-paper
display is shown in Fig. 13. The content shown in this display in this experiment was an image
with black characters on a white background (positive polarity). A color assessment cabinet
(VeriVide CAC 120-5) with a diffuse light source of TL 84 (4000K) was used to control different
levels of illumination (see Fig. 14). The ambient illumination was measured with TOPCON IM-3
photometer. In the experiment, the electronic-paper display was placed inside the color
assessment cabinet with no interference from any external light source, and a bookshelf was used
to support the display. The experimental configuration of workplace was the same as the stage 1
(see Fig. 3).
Figure 13 Electrophoretic e-ink display (STAReBOOK) used in the experiment.
Figure 14 A color assessment cabinet used in this experiment for
producing different ambient illumination levels.
3.3.1.4 Task design and experimental procedure
A series of character-search task was conducted to evaluate the minimum ambient
40
feeling of visual fatigue. This value was treated as a reference value while the subject was in the
rest condition. After completing an experimental task, the subject filled out this questionnaire
again, and subjective visual fatigue was evaluated as the difference between these two raw scores
of questionnaire.
In this study, three dependent measures collected from the character-search tasks were
search time, accuracy and the difference of questionnaire scores. Although the underlying scale
level of subjective visual fatigue is ordinal, the results within non-parametrical and parametrical
analysis were similar. Therefore, three dependent measures were analyzed by the multivariate
analysis of variance (MANOVA), and the Tukey HSD post hoc test was then used for multiple
comparisons. All statistical analyses were calculated using the Statistical Products and Services
Solution (SPSS). The level of significance wasα=0.05.
3.3.2 Results
The results of MANOVA indicated that ambient ilumination (Wilks’λ= 0.669, p < 0.05)
and age (Wilks’λ= 0.475, p < 0.05) had significant effects on the whole dependent measures.
However, there is no significant interaction between ambient illumination and age (Willks’λ=
0.957, p > 0.05).
3.3.2.1 The ambient illumination effects
With regard to the individual dependent variables, ambient illumination significantly
influenced the search time (F(6, 196) = 6.972, p < 0.05) and subjective visual fatigue (F(6, 196) =
11.472, p < 0.05). However, ambient illumination was not the significant factor (F(6, 196) =
0.404, p > 0.05) on the accuracy performance.
Table 16 presents the mean search time of all subjects under each ambient illumination level.
With the ambient illumination of 32 lux, 43 lux, 52 lux, 62 lux, 71 lux, 82 lux, and 92 lux, the
mean search times were 894.00 sec, 830.03 sec, 768.13 sec, 746.73 sec, 741.13 sec, 698.10 sec,
and 683.90 sec, respectively. In general, search time decreased as illumination increased from 32
lux to 92 lux. Ambient illumination was further analyzed by Tukey HSD post hoc test (Table 16).
As can be seen in Table 16 and Fig. 15, there is a significant performance improvement when the
ambient illumination increases above 52 lux. Hence, the 52 lux level represents a key point.

3.3.2.2 The age effects
With regard to the individual dependent variables, age had significant effects on the search
time (F(1, 196) = 84.102, p < 0.05), accuracy (F(1, 196) = 34.193, p < 0.05), and subjective
visual fatigue (F(1, 196) = 12.344, p < 0.05). In respect of the search time measure, the mean
values for the young and the elderly were 668.90 sec and 863.10 sec, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 17, the young had higher search speed than the elderly did in each illumination level. In
respect of the accuracy measure, the mean values for the young and the elderly were 0.91 and
0.86, respectively. As shown in Fig. 18, the young received higher accuracy than the elderly did
on the character-search tasks. In respect of the subjective visual fatigue, the mean values of
difference of questionnaire scores for the young and the elderly were 11.89 and 8.93, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 19, the young felt more visual fatigue than the elderly did in each illumination
level.

In this study, we examined the minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible
electronic-paper display. The present study focused on the ambient illumination factor. Because
of the difference in visual function of adjusting illumination, the visual performances of the
young and the elderly were analyzed together to obtain the general minimum illumination
requirement.
3.3.3.1 The minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible electronic-paper display
In this study, ambient illumination showed significant effect on most dependent measures
except the accuracy measure. These results appear to be in line with the findings of Boschman
and Roufs (1997), who found that accuracy was not a sensitive performance measure in the
search tasks. In addition, it was expected that subjects would pay more attention on accuracy due
to the reward policy, and they might have slowed down their search speed to attain a better
performance. This may be a good reason why accuracy under each level of ambient illumination
was so close and high whether for the young or elderly group (see Fig. 18). Since subjects kept
their accuracy at high levels, the effects of the ambient illumination on legibility were highlighted
only by the search time. Therefore, the minimum ambient illumination requirement for legible
electronic-paper display can be determined by the search time and subjective visual fatigue.
In the present study, we examined the display legibility and users’subjective visual fatigue in
low ambient illumination and validated that lighting is the key factor while using the
electronic-paper display. In general, enhancing ambient lighting could continue to improve the
display legibility and reduce subjective visual fatigue with the illumination range of 32 ~ 92 lux.
Since the significant performance improvement of all subjects occurred at 52 lux on the search
time and at 62 lux on the subjective visual fatigue, the minimum ambient illumination
requirement for legible electronic-paper display can be synthesized at 62 lux. The findings of the
46
elderly. From the previous studies regarding the age effect on the human vision, for the elderly
group, the increased opacity of the lens, coupled with the smaller pupil diameter, reduces the
amount of illumination reaching the retina (Sanders and McCormick, 1993). Weale (1961) found
out that there is a 50 percent reduction in retinal illumination at age 50, compared to age 20, and
this reduction increases to 66 percent at age 60. Hence, even if in the same illumination level, the
young got better visual performance than the elderly did. Because the vision faculties of the
elderly declined, the elderly needed more time for the character-search tasks.
As aspect of the subjective visual fatigue, the results of the present study showed that the
young felt more visual fatigue than the elderly did on the character-search tasks. This means that
the young group was more sensible when the illumination setting changed, in comparison with
the elderly group. In the same illumination condition, the young group also reported more visual
fatigue than the elderly group did. This may be explained by the difference of cognitive task
experience between the young and the elderly. In general, compared to the young, the elderly
have the slower response and lack of sensitivity to ambient environment change. Hence, this may
be the reason that subjective visual fatigue of the young was much higher.
3.3.3.3 The implication of the findings
The invention of VDTs brings our daily life more efficiency and convenience. However,
some problems and limits also accompany if the ambient condition is not just right. Take the
self-illuminated display for example; anyone who tries to use a laptop in a bright lighting
environment will know how difficult these electronic displays can be viewed. Unwanted
reflection due to the bright environment deteriorates the display legibility and causes more visual
fatigue. In addition, these self-illuminated displays, which constantly maintain an image with a
high frequency, not only consume valuable battery life but also cause eyestrain. Fortunately, the
bi-stable electronic-paper display potentially offers an efficient electricity-saving alternative that
only requires power to refresh the image. Since this kind of new display technology is
reflective-type, it is expected to fit to a variety of illumination levels.
Although the electronic-paper display solves the most problems of the self-illuminated
display, there are some accompanying limits which are worthy to be studied. Contrary to the
self-illuminated display, most important limit of all is how capacity it had in low ambient
illumination. In this study, we evaluated the legibility and subjective visual fatigue and tried to
detect the minimum ambient illumination requirement for electronic-paper display. To synthesize
the results of two aspects, the ambient illumination of 62 lux was the minimum point of ambient
illumination for the young and the elderly. Therefore, it is suggested that ambient environment for
electronic-paper display should exceed at least 62 lux for different age users.
In these recent years, the market is now finally ready to embrace electronic-paper display, as
indicated by its inclusion in several application products, ranging from e-books to mobile phones,
indicator labels and signs (Graham-Rowe, 2007). Lexar applied it as a segmented-bar display for
a USB memory-stick device ("Lexar JumpDrive® Secure II Plus USB Flash Drive,"). This
memory meter allows users to see how much memory is free on the device, even when it is
unplugged and not powered. Graham-Rowe (2007) indicated that electronic shelf-label market is

4. Conclusions
This research project aims to evaluate critical factors of electronic paper on both
manufacturing and user sides. In order to attain our research objectives, this project in these 2
years can be divided into 3 stages. Table 18 summarizes the findings of the present project. It can
be divided into manufacturers’ and users’perspectives. As aspect of manufacturing side, the
critical issues include screen reflection problem, flexible design, and background reflectance
setting. Electronic paper manufacturers may take their own strategy in order to deal with these
critical issues. To solve the screen reflection problem and select background reflectance setting,
they usually face a trade-off between better visual quality and lower production cost. For flexible
display design, they also usually face a trade-off between diverse design and worse usability. As
aspect of user side, the critical issue of this project focuses on the effects of ambient illumination.
Since related applications based on electronic paper display expand, users may use it in a wide
range of illumination. Hence, this display may lose its acceptable legibility when users read it in
some illumination conditions.
The findings of this project provide useful guidelines and suggestions on both manufacturing
and user sides. These guidelines can help manufacturers decide their own manufacturing
parameter settings based on the ergonomic consideration. On the other hand, it can let users read
this display in an appropriate illumination environment.

Manufacturing & Service Industries ”也藉此次研討會中開編輯委員會
議，檢討一年來的期刊編輯事務。此期刊於上次會議後，名稱略微調
整，以加上 Service Industries，以因應服務科學研究的潮流。這次編
輯會議，也討論特刊主題，如醫療照護學院之人因工程應用。綠色能
源學院介面之人因設計等等，以吸引專家論文投稿。提升期刊論文品
質。
三、考察參觀活動
本屆會議未安排參觀活動，本人會後赴波多黎各拜訪當年室友，
目前任教波多黎各大學化學系兼大學研究中心主任。波大有十一個校
