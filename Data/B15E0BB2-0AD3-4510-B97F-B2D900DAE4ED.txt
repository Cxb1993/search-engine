in [19]-[21] to avoid using four times 
oversampling. These methods use an interpolator 
to find the peak of the four (L = 4) times 
oversampled OFDM signal around some searched 
samples of the discrete-time OFDM signal 
oversampled with a factor lower than four. Two 
types of “search-and-partial-interpolation” (SPI) 
schemes, SPI-1 and SPI-2, were proposed in [21] 
to efficiently estimate the PAPR value of the 
OFDM signal, where the SPI-1 and the SPI-2 
schemes can be regarded as an improvement on 
the work of [19] and [20], respectively. Also, 
some criteria were derived in [21] to determine the 
interpolation filter length and the threshold of 
sample power for the interpolation process. It was 
verified that the SPI-1 and SPI-2 schemes in [21] 
have a good PAPR estimation performance and 
can easily be combined with the SLM-based 
method. However, one drawback of the SPI-1 
scheme is that the computational complexity is 
still greater than the method that uses the four 
times oversampling technique when the number of 
subcarriers is not greater than 128. In addition, the 
SPI-2 scheme still uses the two times 
oversampling technique. 
In this project, we present a new method to 
resolve the drawbacks of the SPI-1 and the SPI-2 
schemes mentioned above. The new method first 
generates a cost function by adding the power of 
two neighboring samples that are not oversampled, 
and then uses the cost function as a criterion to 
select the samples to be interpolated. Computer 
simulations show that the proposed method can 
achieve a better PAPR estimation performance 
than the SPI-1 scheme in [21], and has a lower 
computational complexity because there are fewer 
interpolated samples. Moreover, the oversampling 
technique is not needed for the proposed 
algorithm. 
III. Background 
In OFDM systems with N subcarriers, the 
continuous-time baseband signal of an input signal 
X = [X[0], X[1], ..., X[N−1] ]T can be represented 
as

where X[s] is the data symbol carried by the sth 
subcarrier, Δf is the frequency difference between 
subcarriers, and T = 1/Δf is the OFDM symbol 
duration. x(t) is a band-limited signal with the 
Nyquist frequency fN = NΔf = N/T. The PAPR of 
x(t) is defined as

where 2σ  is the mean power of x(t). The

can be generated by sampling x(t) with sampling 
period 1T  = T/N and can be expressed as

In PAPR reduction methods, the oversampling 
technique is usually used to get the discrete-time 
signal for estimating the PAPR of the 
continuous-time signal x(t). It has been verified 
that the discrete-time OFDM signal obtained by 
using the four times (L = 4) oversampling 
technique can achieve a good approximation of 
the PAPR estimation of (2) [9]. However, using 
the four times oversampling technique 
significantly increases the computational 
complexity of OFDM systems, especially for 
methods that need several IFFT computations. 
Several methods were proposed in [19]-[21] to 
estimate the PAPR of x(t), where an interpolator 
was used to interpolate the four-times 
oversampled samples around some searched 
samples with sampling period T/N or T/2N. An 
interpolator is a discrete-time low-pass filter for 
increasing the sampling rate by a factor of L [23], 
whose impulse response is

From (12), we find that the term

20.81σ  on average in the interpolation process of 
(10). Furthermore, 04[4 2]x n +  as well as x(t) has 
a mean power 2σ , so 
0n
S  provides about 81% 
of the sample power 0
2
4| [4 2] |x n +  on average in 
the interpolation process of (10). If 04[4 2]x n +  is 
the peak of an OFDM symbol, then 
0
2
4| [4 2] |x n +  should be greater than or equal to 
the minimum possible peak power N
γΦ  with 
probability γ. In other words, 04[4 2]x n +  has a 
high probability of forming a peak if 
0n
S  is 
greater than or equal to 0.81 N
γΦ . Therefore, 
0.81TH N≥ Φγα  would be a valid threshold for the 
scheme that uses 
0n
S  to select samples to 
perform the interpolation. The two neighboring 
points 04[4 1]x n +  and 04[4 3]x n +  also have a 
high probability of forming the peak if 
0
0.81n NS ≥ Φγ . Accordingly, we propose an 
enhanced SPI (ESPI) scheme by using the cost 
function 
1n
S  as follows: 
Step 1. For an input signal 
[ ][0], [1],..., [ 1] TX X X N= −X , find 
[ ]1 1 1[0], [1],..., [ 1] Tx x x N= −x = IFFT{X}. 
Step 2. Compute the cost function

1 1[ ]x n  as follows:

Step 3. Record the time indexes 1n  with 
1n TH
S α≥ , 0 ≤ 1n  ≤ N−1, as a set S1, 
where THα  is a predefined threshold. 
Step 4. Interpolate the three samples 
14[4 1]x n + , 14[4 2]x n + , and 
14[4 3]x n +  that are between 1 1[ ]nx  
and 1 1[ 1]x n +  for each 1 1n ∈S . 
Step 5. Find the sample that has the highest 
power among 1 1[ ]nx , 1 1[ 1]x n + , and 
the three interpolated samples 
14[4 1]x n + , 14[4 2]x n + , and 
14[4 3]x n +  for 1 1n ∈S ; then use the 
highest sample power to estimate the 
PAPR of x(t) for the input signal X. 
Fig. 2.a shows an example of the continuous-time 
signal x(t) and three original discrete-time samples, 
1 0[ 1]x n − , 1 0[ ]nx , and 1 0[ 1]x n + , that do not use 
the oversampling technique, where the 
corresponding values of 
1n
S  of these three 
samples are shown in Fig. 2.b. We find that 
0n
S  
at 1 0n n=  is greater than the predefined threshold 
THα . Thus, three samples 04[4 1]x n + , 
04[4 2]x n + , and 04[4 3]x n +  for four times 
oversampling will be interpolated in step 4 and 
will be used to estimate the peak power in step 5 
along with the two samples 1 0[ ]nx  and 1 0[ 1]x n +  
in the proposed ESPI scheme. Similar to the SPI-1 
scheme, the ESPI scheme can be combined with 
the SLM method for PAPR reduction. Fig. 3 
shows a modified SLM (MSLM) architecture 
using the ESPI scheme, where the estimated PAPR 
values from the M ESPI units are used to select 
the candidate signal for transmission. 
The OFDM system without using the 
oversampling technique needs an IFFT unit to 
generate the discrete-time OFDM signal, N power 
computations, and N–1 comparisons to find the 
peak power. It is easy to deduce that there are 
1.5N–2 trivial multiplications for an N-point IFFT 
computation based on the radix-2 
decimation-in-frequency (DIF) algorithm [23]. So, 
the N-point IFFT outputs are produced by 
0.5Nlog2N–1.5N+2 complex multiplications and 
Nlog2N complex additions if these trivial 
multiplications are exclusive [21]. Furthermore, a 
complex addition is equivalent to two real 
additions; a complex multiplication is equivalent 
to four real multiplications and two real additions. 
A comparison is equivalent to a real addition; to 
calculate the sample power requires two real 
multiplications and one real addition. Therefore, 
6 
 
oversampling for full-search, which is better than 
the MSLM-1 scheme of [21] with the threshold 
1 0.50 N
γα = Φ . 
Fig. 6 provides a comparison of the 
computational complexity of the MSLM scheme 
using the proposed ESPI algorithm with 
TH N
γα = Φ , the MSLM-1 scheme of [21] with 
1 0.50 N
γα = Φ , and the CSLM schemes with L 
times oversampling for different N. In Fig. 6, the 
number of real additions and real multiplications 
of the CSLM scheme with L = 4 are regarded as 
100% and the other schemes are compared with 
the CSLM scheme with L = 4. This comparison 
shows that the computational complexity of the 
MSLM scheme using the proposed ESPI 
algorithm is less than that of the MSLM-1 scheme 
proposed in [21] and that of the CSLM scheme 
with L = 4 when N ≥ 64. Table II lists the 
threshold values and the average number of 
samples selected to perform the interpolation for 
the proposed ESPI scheme and the SPI-1 scheme 
in [21]. It shows that the number of selected 
samples to perform the interpolation for the 
proposed ESPI scheme is less than or equal to that 
of the SPI-1 scheme of [21] when N ≥ 64.
