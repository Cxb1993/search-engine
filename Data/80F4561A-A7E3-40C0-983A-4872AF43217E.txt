（二）英文摘要 
This research is for the analysis, representation, aggregation, and decision making of 
systems with humanistic uncertainties. Neural-fuzzy systems have been proved to be very useful 
and have been applied to modeling many humanistic problems. But these systems also have 
many difficulties such as the generalization problem, the curse of dimensionality, and the 
convergence problems. Support vector machines (SVMs), which are based on the statistical 
learning theory and the kernel transformation, overcome most of these problems.  However, it 
does not have the ability to represent and to aggregate vague and not well defined systems. In our 
last report, we developed two support vector fuzzy adaptive networks (SVFANs), one for 
classification and the other for regression. Another way to fuzzify the support vector machine is 
to fuzzify the kernel. In this past year, we developed a fuzzy support vector machine based on the 
fuzzification of the kernel. 
 
Keywords: Support vector machines, fuzzy support vector machines, soft computing, fuzzy 
logic, fuzzy decision making.

1. 前言 
 
Fuzzy adaptive networks or neural-fuzzy systems [1,2], which are formed by the 
combination of neural network and fuzzy logic, are useful approaches for modeling many 
humanistic problems. However, the fuzzy adaptive network (FAN) have several problems such 
as those of generalization, dimensionality, and convergence. The recently developed support 
vector machines (SVM) [3-5], which are based on statistical learning theory and the use of kernel 
transformation, overcome some of the problems. But SVM do not have the ability to represent 
and to aggregate vague and ill-defined information. Thus, to combine the SVM and FAN, thus 
taking the advantages of both approaches, appears to be desirable. 
In our last report, the SVM learning algorithms are applied to the various FAN networks 
and a support fuzzy adaptive network (SVFAN) is formulated for regression (for details, see [6]). 
Another way to fuzzify the support vector machine is to fuzzify the kernel. In this past year, we 
developed a fuzzy support vector machine based on the fuzzification of the kernel.

This research is for the analysis, representation, aggregation, and decision making of 
systems with humanistic uncertainties. The purpose of the investigation is to develop a fuzzy 
support vector machine based on the fuzzification of the kernel. 
 
3. 文獻探討 
 
Various researchers have investigated the use of SVM in fuzzy-neural systems. Jeng and 
Chuang [7] did some basic research on applying support vector regression (SVR) in determining 
the initial structure of fuzzy neural networks. Chan et al. [8, 9] proposed methods to select the 
structure of neural networks and neural-fuzzy systems based on support vector regression and 
applied them to the modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems. The ε-insensitive learning 
algorithm from the SVR was integrated with the traditional fuzzy modeling by Leski [10,11] to 
build the connection between the fuzzy modeling and the statistical learning theories. Kim et al. 
[12] tried to construct new fuzzy inference systems based on SVR and an extended kernel 
method. Hong and Hwang [12] used SVMs for multivariate fuzzy regression. In an earlier paper 
[6], the SVM learning algorithms were applied to the various FAN networks and a support vector 
fuzzy adaptive network (SVFAN) was formulated. Furthermore, the proposed SVFAN retains 
most of the advantages of the original SVM and FAN systems. Another way to fuzzify the 
support vector machine is to fuzzify the kernel. In this past year, we developed a fuzzy support 
vector machine based on the fuzzification of the kernel [13].

Suppose A and B are two symmetric triangular fuzzy number. p is the ratio between the 
mode and the spread. Thus, the symmetric triangular fuzzy number A and B can be represented 
as (a, a/p) and (b, b/p) respectively. The fuzzy similarity measure between two triangular fuzzy 
numbers A and B can be written as:

Since we will deal with fuzzy data, we shall assume the parameter, p, is approximately the 
same for all the fuzzy data. 
The similarity degree between A and B is calculated as the ratio of the intersection areas to 
the union areas of A and B. It is noted that p is a user-defined parameter which represents how 
fuzzy the data is (the smaller the p, the fuzzier or wider the fuzzy number). The similarity can be 
obtained based on the following four different cases.

The numerical study was carried out on a Pentium IV (3.06 GHZ) with 512 MB RAM. To 
obtain reasonably good parameters values for C and iξ , the 8-fold cross-validation method was 
used. The average testing error (ATE) through the 8-fold cross-validation is calculated as one of 
the evaluation criterions. Another evaluation criterion is the average running time (ART).

The results show that the proposed fuzzy similarity kernel SVM is an effective tool for 
classification and regression. It is worthwhile to note that one important advantage of the fuzzy 
based kernel is their ability in handling uncertain and vague data.
