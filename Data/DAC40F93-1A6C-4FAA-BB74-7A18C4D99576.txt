Abstract 
 
Standard Penetration Test (SPT) employs a rod as the intermediate to transfer the pounding 
energy from a hammer to a penetrometer to test the hardness of soil beneath the grade. The 
adopting rod surely affects the testing performance simply because of the inevitable loss of 
pounding energy during transmission. This study presents the effectiveness of the direct delivery 
of the hammer’s energy onto the penetrometer by dismissing the rod from the energy-transfer 
mechanism of the conventional SPT. This is an effective way applicable for the development of a 
“down-hole” type method/equipment. Some laboratory experiments of conventional SPT were 
conducted on one hand to examine the efficiency of the energy transfer, in which the mass ratios 
of various hammers to a chosen rod were tested. On the other hand, additional experiments 
without the influence of the rod were conducted to calibrate the mass ratio effects employing 
Newton’s pendulum model. A simple experimental arrangement consisting of a mechanical 
system of colliding bodies and sensors containing high-speed camera and accelerometers are used 
to measure the motion of collisions. Both the size of the bodies and the colliding speeds to the 
energy and the momentum transfer were examined and measured. The experimental results 
conclude two important points for designing an efficient down-hole SPT to enhance the 
efficiency of energy transfer: (1) having both hammer and sampler equally weighted and (2) 
facilitating a point contact during pounding. In real practices, employing lead-core hammer or 
other measures to reduce the size of the hammer is helpful for down-hole testing. 
 
Keywords: SPT, energy transfer, rodless SPT, down-hole hammer, Newton’s pendulum.

I. Introduction 
 
The testing device for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) consists of three main parts: the 
hammer, the drill rod (with an anvil atop), and the sampler (penetrometer). They are employed to 
convey the energy generated by hammer pounding through the drill rod downward to advance the 
sampler into the ground. The hammer pounding energy transits at least three important interfaces 
along the transmission route: between the hammer and rod, the rod and sampler, and the sampler 
and soil. Some earlier studies, e.g. Kovacs et al. 1977 and Seed et al. 1985, have indicated that 
the results of the SPT test are influenced by many test variables (hammer’s types, releasing 
mechanisms, rod’s size, rod’s joints, etc.). There is little doubt that the accuracy of the test can 
only be greatly improved if the effects of these variables are eliminated or reduced by either 
accounting for the variables when the test results are interpreted or reducing their effects by 
modifications in the testing device itself. Therefore, efforts onto the researches for the SPT 
improvements are mainly categorized in two: (1) clarifying the effects of relevant variables for 
the interpretation of test results and (2) modifying the parts of SPT testing device.  
The SPT “prototype” is so deeply imprinted on the industry for long that an engineer would 
simply take for granted a heavy hammer, a long rod and a split-spoon sampler as the SPT 
essentials. Studies in the literatures thus mostly fall into the first category. Nevertheless, idea for 
the modification and improvement of the testing equipment can still be found (e.g. Serota and 
Lowther 1973; Riggs et al., 1984). It should be mentioned that the performance of improvements 
is mostly subjected to one common standard – the Reference Test Procedure for Energy 
Measurement of ISSMFE (1988) and the transferred rod energy by ASTM D4633 (2005). 
ASTM D4633 asks the SPT energy measurement conducted at the top of the drill rod, and 
the resulted in energy ratio represents the energy reaching the rod (the rod energy) to the energy 
delivered by the hammer pounding. This method has offered legitimacy to adopt the rod as an 
unexpendable part in the SPT equipment. Nevertheless, many earlier studies like Schertmann and 
Palacious (1979) mentioned that the length of the drill rod directly would affect the amount of 
energy transferred into the rod. Others, e.g. Boulanger and Idriss (1999), pointed out that the 
weight (or size) of drill rod would seriously affect the transfer of pounding energy, i.e. increasing 
the rod’s weight would worsen the energy transfer efficiency. Another studies, such as 
Abou-matar and Goble (1997) and Tsai and Lieu (2004) indicated that the joints of the rod would 
distort the transmitting stress wave and thus interfere with the energy measurement. Additional 
later studies further covered an arguing issues regarding whether the FV method or the F2 method 
the better one for the SPT transfer energy measurement (Daniel and Howie, 2005 and Tsai, 2005). 
All the above arguments conclude that the energy loss because of the rod is not only inevitable 
but uncontrollable.  
It is noted that ASTM D4633 had been once suspended for years with no corresponding 
substitute. To a certain extent, the long suspension status has given a valuable space to reflect the 
old issue once again “Is rod a must for the SPT?” In my earlier field experience in California, 
U.S.A. around 1990’s, a specially designed “down-hole” hammer was in real practices although it 
a falling hammer collides a still sampler in an incident speed . The energy and momentum of 
the hammer-sampler system are described as:

maximum 100% when =1.0 (i.e. = ). Some earlier experiments have shown that energy 
loss is inevitable in real world, and the energy of the hammer-sampler system described in Eq. (2)

employing a 3m long A-sized rod as the intermediate to transfer the pounding energy from a 
hammer. Many previous studies, e.g. Fairhurst (1961), Palacios (1977), and Schmertmann and 
Palacios (1979), have great contribution on understanding the complicate mechanism of energy 
transfer in the rod. Others, e.g. Odebrecht et al. (2005) and Johnsen and Jagello (2007), pointed 
out the effects of the length as well as the size of rod. Another, e.g. Tsai and Liu (2006), 
mentioned the influences caused by the joints and the associated fastening and aligning of a long 
rod in real practices. This study, on the other hand, is trying to exempt from the troublesome rod 
induced effects and problems and to study the applicability of the “rodless” SPT on the basis of 
above described theory. Additional experiments are then carried out for examining body-impact 
phenomena in details and will be depicted in the next section. 
 
IV. Experiments of Simple Body Collision 
 
As mentioned earlier, the drill rod is a pragmatic solution to overcome the operational 
difficulty in delivering the hammer pounding energy downward to the deep subsurface. An 
otherwise option employing a “down-hole” hammer to directly strike the sampler below the grade 
has been known for long but leave a gap with scarce measurement data regarding the efficiency 
of the different energy transfer mechanism in the literatures. The following sections are to fill the 
gap with a systemic exploitation on the useful fundamentals of body-impact collision. 
Different from previous studies that commonly adopted theoretical models describing a 
compressive-stress wave traveling in a cylindrical rod (e.g. Timoshenko and Goodier, 1970) to 
simulate the motion of stress waves in a drill rod. This study takes the slender-rod case no longer 
the issue; instead the direct energy transfer during impact is of concern other than the 
after-impact stress-wave traveling. Physical model of elastic body-impact that is assimilated by a 
clever device named Newton’s cradle (Figure 3). 
The Newton’s cradle not only demonstrates a pendulum, but also shows the law of 
conservation of momentum and energy via body-impact collision. Its special configuration shows 
two important layouts to achieve a perfect impact. First, the body-impact is accomplished via a 
very quick point touch between steel balls; secondly, the perfect straight collision path is aligned 
by a very genius way using two hanging strings apart to hold a ball steady during impact. Figure 
4 shows a larger scaled Newton’s cradle accommodating different sized steel balls with adjustable 
strings as suspensions for the present testing. Sizes, masses and physical properties of the steel 
balls are given in Table 4. Upon testing, high-speed camera is employed to remotely monitor the 
macro-activity of the balls’ motion before and after the impact. Therefore, the time-varying 
positions of steel balls are traced and recorded. In the mean time, accelerometers are wired to the 
balls to closely record their micro-activity during the impact. 
The chosen accelerometers are equipped with a quartz crystal disc to sense the dynamic 
motion. Once subjected to a shock, the corresponding acceleration-time history is recorded as 
voltage changes of the circuit with the quartz crystal. The measured history is visually monitored 
by an oscilloscope equipped with four channels, in which sampling rate is set of 50 KS/sec, i.e. 
deformation of the surface of the balls.  
 
V. Experiments of Rodless SPT 
 
To make an attempt to the application for real practices, the above mentioned simple body 
collision experiments have been enhanced employing prototypical rodless SPT samplers for more 
experiments. As shown in Figure 9 the adopted rodless SPT models (prototypes) couple the steel 
balls used earlier with SPT samplers as the extension. Table 7 summarizes the mass and length of 
each chosen model. The shown feature is a conjugation of a conventional SPT sampler and a 
round-head anvil expelling the rod used to be in between. The round-head anvil (the steel ball) 
atop the sampler provides a point contact that has been proven possessing better energy transfer 
during hammer pounding with higher accuracy, comparing to a commonly seen flat-top anvil 
(Tsai and Liou, 2001). 
The subsequent experiments are performed in the similar way as that employed in the last 
series except the collisions are between samplers mounted with equal or different weighted steel 
balls (Figure 10). Another 80 controlled impacts have been conducted for four colliding cases 
with the four designated drop heights from 10 cm to 40 cm.  
Table 8 shows some chosen experimental results for the designated drop height of 10 cm. 
Similar to those shown in Table 5, the present results display nearly elastic collisions with energy 
loss less than 2%. The measured collision time for all cases are around 220μ sec and 420 μ sec 
for collisions with and without a smaller steel ball in the pair, respectively. One obvious 
difference from the last simple collision series, the theoretical energy transfer ratio for the present 
unequally-sized collisions is 80%.  
The time histories of the recorded accelerations and the according velocities for the 
designated drop height of 10 cm will be depicted in another refining version as additional figures. 
In this version, Table 9 summarizes the according calculated values, including the energy losses 
and ratios of energy transfer . It is noted that the efficiency of energy transferring to the 
prototypical samplers remains equally good as that of the last series. The shifts of shape and 
weight of testing objects from the simple body collisions between the steel balls to the rodless 
SPT samplers have negligible effects on the concern with respect to real practices. They all 
demonstrate very efficient energy transfer from hammer to sampler. The present experimental 
results tell that the applicability of the rodless SPT testing employing the concept of simple body 
collision in engineering practices is very promising.

VI. Discussion of Energy Transfer from Hammer to Sampler 
 
Two conceptual fundamentals are crucial to produce creditable SPT testing results 
(N-values): (1) a right amount of pounding energy at each blow, i.e. 475 joule; (2) a standard 
shaped penetrometer, the split-barrel sampler, driven by the pounding energy to examine 
 7

mechanical and operational interfaces affect the accuracy of the existing SPT.  
This study recommends a different approach to improve the SPT by withdrawing a 
redundant part of the conventional SPT device, i.e. the rod, to eliminate one troublesome 
mechanical interruption along the transmission of energy from the hammer to the sampler. This 
approach will benefit a down-hole type testing by enhancing the efficiency of the existing SPT 
via hammer directly pounding on sampler without much energy loss.  
 The behavior of the proposed SPT testing without rod is best simulated using simple 
body-impact theory other than the previously adopted theory describing a compressive-stress 
wave traveling in a cylindrical rod. Classical Newton’s Cradle contributes a prototype model to 
develop the associated laboratory works. Experiments were performed to observe the efficiency 
of colliding energy transfer. Important conclusions and recommendations of the present study are: 
1. The efficiency of energy transfer can be first improved by employing point-contact 
mechanism at hammer striking. 
2. Ratio of energy transfer reaches nearly 100% when the two colliding bodies are equal 
weighted, i.e. the mass ratio equals one. 
3. The recorded colliding durations are so tiny that beyond common engineering sense in 
practices, and the current experiments could not provide clear evidence regarding the correlation 
between the durations and any factor of current interest.  
4. A 40% reduction of the free fall energy, or the hammer’s weight, is a slackening of the 
present rodless SPT to directly fulfill the international reference of 60% energy ratio. In addition, 
employing a lead-core hammer or others pounding energy drivers, such as air-gun driver can 
further reduce the size of hammer and increase the applicability in real practices.
