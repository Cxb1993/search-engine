中文摘要 
預期性姿勢控制定義為個體在執行ㄧ項自主動作之前，身體其他部位肌肉（特別是維
持姿勢的肌肉）就先啟動，並產生身體質量中心位置調整的控制反應。其作用是預測自體
動作可能產生的姿勢干擾並預先產生適當的反應以減少自體動作產生的姿勢干擾與所需的
平衡反應。發展性協調障礙兒童普遍有平衡缺失的問題，其平衡的缺失是否與預期性姿勢
控制有關是本實驗欲探究的問題。本實驗另一個要探討的問題是預期性姿勢控制是否與姿
勢干擾的大小有關。本實驗以 8 名 4 至 6 歲的發展性協調障礙兒童與 16 名年齡相當的正常
發展兒童為對象，藉由三種舉手速度（慢速、普通速度、快速）與兩種地面（力板、軟墊）
作為獨立變項的實驗設計，比較兩組兒童在姿勢控制上的差異。依變項包括壓力中心晃動
面積、舉手的反應時間、姿勢性肌肉相對舉手動作肌肉的反應時間，與姿勢性肌肉的收縮
型式。結果顯示發展性協調障礙兒童的壓力中心晃動面積較正常兒童大，舉手的反應時間
較長。發展性協調障礙兒童姿勢性肌肉相對舉手動作肌肉之反應時間也較長，且多落在預
期性姿勢控制的時間外，兩組間的差異不受舉手速度影響。兩組受試兒童在肌肉收縮型式
則是以由近端至遠端的收縮型式占大多數。這些結果意謂著發展性協調障礙兒童平衡控制
較差，可能與下肢的預期性姿勢控制缺失有關；然而預期性姿勢控制似乎不受姿勢干擾（舉
手速度）的影響。

Background and Purpose 
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) refers to the difficulty in motor coordination 
and acquisition of new motor skills and such difficulty cannot be explained by any intellectual, 
sensory, or motor neurological impairment (Hall, 1988; APA, 1994).  About 5-8% of children 
are reported to have suffered from this disorder in the western countries (Henderson & Hall, 1982; 
APA, 1994).  
Although the manifestations of motor coordination impairment that children with DCD 
present may range widely from gross motor activities such as running, jumping, and stair 
climbing, to fine motor skills like buttoning, using scissors, and handwriting, a very common 
complaint that parents and teachers have concerns the children’s poor balance, especially at 
younger ages (Forseth & Sigmundsson, 2003; Henderson & Hall, 1982; Pless, Persson, Sundelin, 
& Carlsson, 2001).  Many assumptions of the mechanism underlying the clumsiness in children 
with DCD have been proposed, such as visual perceptual deficits (Lord & Hulme, 1988), 
kinesthetic perceptual deficits (Smyth & Mason, 1998; Coleman et. al., 2001), or cross modal 
perceptual deficit (Newnham & McKenzie, 1993). Other assumptions based on the aspect of 
motor control mechanisms, such as motor programming deficit (Smyth, 1991), muscular strength 
weakness, or muscle power inadequacy (Raynor, 2001) all have also been discussed.  However, 
no consensus has been reached (Schoemaker et al., 2001; Coleman et al., 2001, Smyth et al., 
2001).  In fact, every skilled movement can be looked as a product of two interrelated phases of 
action. One is postural control phase, which provides an oriented and stable phase (preparation) 
for movement; the other is an executory one (Massion 1992).  One of the main characteristics of 
the children with DCD is poor balance.  The deficit of postural control may be a major role of 
the problem contributing to motor clumsiness in the children with DCD. 
Therefore, the purposes of this study were to 1) examine and compare the anticipatory 
postural control in children with and without DCD; 2) compare the effect of the size of postural 
perturbation (arm raising velocity) on anticipatory postural control in children with and without 
DCD; 3) To compare the effect of the size of postural perturbation (foot support conditions) on 
anticipatory postural control in children with and without DCD.  
Method 
Subjects 
Eight children with DCD (4-6 years; 6 boys and 2 girls) and 16 age comparable normal 
children (4-6 years; 10 boys and 6 girls) were recruited from local hospitals and community to 
participate in the study.  The body weight and height of children with DCD were not statistically 
significant different from those in normal children.  However, the Movement ABC percentile 
rank scores were significantly lower in children with DCD than normal children (DCD: 8.4 ± 
4.34; normal: 74.9 ± 21.97). 
 
Equipment 
Postural stability was measured with a Kistler force platform (Kistler 9286AA; Kistler 
 6
outside the range of APA (Figure 2).  However, the differences of relative latencies of postural 
muscles between groups were not affected with arm raising velocity.  Both groups of children 
adopted the proximal to distal postural strategy more often than the distal to proximal strategy 
(Figure 3 a, b).  The results implicate that the balance deficit is associated with the deficit of 
APA in children with DCD.

第 15屆國際醫學與生物學之力學研討會與會心得報告 
(XVth International Conference on Mechanics in Medicine and 
Biology, ICMMB-15)  
 
 
一、 參加會議經過 
 
ICMMB首次會議於 1976舉行，之後每兩年舉辦一次，今年是第 15屆，
歷時三十年了。今年的會議由新加坡的南洋科技大學主辦，會期由十二月六
日到八日，共三個整天。此大會乃生物力學界的一大盛會，來自世界各地生
物力學實驗室的學者專家多會趁此機會群聚一堂互相切蹉，互相較量。因此
盛況更是空前。今年共有來自美國、加拿大、台灣、日本、紐西蘭、澳州、
英國、義大利、韓國以及新加坡等各地的學者的論文發表。台灣也有近三十
位學者與學生參與，共襄盛舉。 
此會議的安排，除了有專題演講外，每天有五個場次的口頭論文同時
段舉行，此會議的特色是論文的發表全是口頭方式，因此對初次參與國際會
議需以英文口頭報告的人來說是一大考驗，也是一種經驗。整個會議都是在
旅館進行，雖然舒適與方便，但場地不夠寬敞，且為了經費的緣故，並未提
供與會者使用電腦與網路的服務，讓與會者非常不便，無法查信件也無法隨
時與國內的實驗室或學生聯繫，這是此次主辦單位的一大缺失，大會美中不
足的地方。筆者在此次會議中，主持一個場次的報告，並發表兩篇論文。因
此相當忙碌，但也頗有收穫。筆者主持的一場主題為 Clinical Biomechanics；
