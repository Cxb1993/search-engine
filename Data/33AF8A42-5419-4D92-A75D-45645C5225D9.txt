圖二(a)為 p 型載子掺雜矽單式光柵的中紅外吸
收頻譜。其尖峰來自於表面電漿的激發，圖上可發現
，和條狀結構較窄的虛線條相比，結構較寬的實線條
峰值大了數倍，因結構較窄時，輻射和結構有較強之
交互作用而影響表面電漿的耦合。另外，和圖中最左
方之尖峰相比，發現改變入射角可調整吸收峰值的波
長(中間尖峰)，若固定此時入射角並更進一步改變週
期，仍有類似現象(右方尖峰)。圖二(b)中則在 n 型載
子掺雜，不同週期(藍線與紅線)下，發現改變載子濃
度會使吸收頻譜的尖峰產生微量的偏移。 
圖三將探討的波長縮小至 5~10 m，尖峰的目標
波長為 7m，發現該幾何尺寸下，單式光柵的峰值
易受入射角增加而大幅減小，而複式光柵不但具較寬
的尖峰，且峰值受入射角增加的影響較低，顯現複式
光柵頻譜特性較不易受方向改變。

內部的摻雜濃度具有週期性的輪廓，其週期可針對目
標物質光學性質調整表面電漿激發的頻率，其高度及
寬度則可作為最佳化的微調參數。在無目標物質的情
形下，反射光的能量維持一定的長度，僅在特定波長
下因激發表面電漿而趨近於零，一旦目標物質濃度改
變，整個反射率頻譜都將會不同且激發表面電漿的頻
 
 
而所對應到的波長峰值也接近於穿透率頻譜。此二圖
的比較可以得知，即使空腔共振因為狹縫中的金屬附
著物而波長偏移，穿透率與吸收率的峰值波長仍彼此
吻合。其次，狹縫入口的金屬附著物原則上是會降低
穿透率的峰值，然而一旦激發空腔共振，較窄的狹縫
入口卻能有數倍於較寬狹縫入口的穿透率。

ABSTRACT 
Mid-Infrared radiative properties (absorptance, 
reflectance, and transmittance) of submicron gold slit arrays 
have been numerically studied with rigorous coupled-wave 
analysis and the finite difference time domain method. The slit 
width varies from 50 nm to 300 nm and a square feature may 
attach at either or both slit sides. Although the wavelength is 
one or two orders of magnitude longer than the side length of 
features, the attached nanoscale features can modify radiative 
properties significantly. Directional dependence on radiative 
properties has also been detail investigated by looking into 
electromagnetic fields and Poynting vectors of selected slit 
geometry. One possible physical mechanism, cavity resonance, 
account for unique radiative properties have been suggested and 
verified in the study as well.

INTRODUCTION 
Sub-wavelength periodic structures have demonstrated 
wavelength- or polarization-selective radiative properties 
(transmittance, absorptance, and reflectance), which are critical 
for many optical devices and thermal applications [1]. For 
example, linear polarizers composed of metallic wire grids on a 
transparent substrate have been used for a long time [2]. Two-
dimensional hole arrays exhibited promising potentials in near-
field microscopy and photon extraction [3]. Three-dimensional 
tungsten photonic crystals were fabricated for tuning emittance 
spectrum [4]. Specifically, one-dimensional metallic slit arrays 
could boost the development of nanolithography and energy 
conversion devices such that their unique radiative properties 
were investigated both numerically and experimentally [5]. 
Their enhanced transmittance was attributed to several physical 
mechanisms, including Wood’s anomaly, cavity resonance, and 
effective medium behavior [6,7]. On the other hand, some 
researchers [8] admitted the positive role of surface plasmon 
polaritons (SPP) for transmission enhancement while others [9] 
might not. A quantitative analysis was conducted recently on 
enhanced absorption and transmission through silver slits for 
clarifying contributions from SPP and other physical 
mechanisms [10]. Obviously, either one or the interplay of 
multiple mechanisms can tailor the spectrum of radiative 
properties with strong dependence on slit geometry. Though 
correlations between tailoring mechanisms and unique radiative

Figure 1 shows the freestanding slits in vacuum with 
square features attached both walls symmetrically at the slit 
inlet. The TM wave is incident from vacuum in Region I while 
the reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) is in Region I and 
Region III, respectively. Region II is composed of mediums Au 
and free space such that the dielectric function is a periodic 
function of x with the period Λ. Here, Region II is divided into 
two slabs with different thickness because f is different in each 
slab. The key to modify RCWA equations is keeping the 
tangential EM field components continuous at the interface 
between slabs. Except two interfaces among regions, the 
additional interfaces within Region II will cause instability 
during the inverse of matrixes in calculation. Such instability 
can be resolved by proposed numerical stable enhanced 
approach in Ref. [26]. In principle, RCWA can obtain radiative 
properties of slits with any feature variation because Region II 
can be divided into many slabs with appropriate metallic filling 
ratio f and slid depth d. However, one should be cautious about 
the Fourier transform of periodic dielectric function. Unlike 
single slab, slit geometry differs with relatively lateral shift 
among each slab. Desired slit geometry can be built successfully 
in the numerical model only when d, f, and relatively lateral 
shift of each slab are correctly inputted. 
In Fig. 1, the wavevector k defines the direction of 
incidence, and the angle between k and the surface normal z is 
the angle of incidence θ, also called the zenith angle. For the 
TM wave, the magnetic field H is perpendicular to the plane of 
incidence (the x−z plane), i.e., parallel to the y direction. The 
angle between the reflectance/transmittance and surface normal 
is the same as θ. One reason is the same mediums in Region I 
and Region III, and another one is the large ratio of λ/Λ, which 
makes only the zeroth order diffraction propagating waves. That 
is, the reflectance and transmittance are exactly the zeroth order 
reflected and transmitted diffraction efficiency, respectively. 
Other orders of diffraction are evanescent waves, which decay 
exponentially and can contribute to EM fields only in the near-
field. Hence, the reflectance and transmittance also has the same 
magnitude of wavevector k = ω/c and its parallel component kx 
= k⋅sinθ, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. In RCWA, the 
efficiency of each diffraction order is computed from the time-
average Poynting vector in the z direction. The directional-
hemispherical reflectance/transmittance is the summation of all 
reflected/transmitted order efficiency, and only the zeroth order 
is not zero and considered here. Once reflectance (R) and 
transmittance (T) are obtained, the absorptance (A) can be 
calculated by A = 1 − R − T based on the energy balance.  
The validation of RCWA codes was examined in several 
ways, including numerical convergence and energy balance 
check. One way of convergence check is to increase the number 
of slabs in Region II for the same slit geometry. For example, 
the reflectance and transmittance of the representative Au slits 
can be obtained with one 110-nm-thick slab or three slabs with 
total thickness the same. Although the thickness of each slab is 
varied, the reflectance and transmittance deviation is less than 
10-5 at normal incidence and λ = 3 μm. Another way is to 
increase the Fourier transform terms of periodic dielectric 
functions in Region II. Note that RCWA solution is accurate to 
an arbitrary level with enough spatial-harmonic terms. Based on 
the previous work [24], total 81 Fourier transform terms are 
sufficient for convergence and again tested with the 
representative slits. At λ = 3 μm and λ = 15 μm the deviation of 
R and T are less than 0.002 as the number of terms increases to 
121, 161, and 201. On the other hand, energy balance is 
confirmed by the unity summation of R and T if Au is replaced 
with dielectrics (no absorption). The RCWA codes are also 
modified to successfully duplicate slit transmittance and 
absorptance from other published numerical works [10]. A 
Pentium 4 computer with two 2.0 GHz processors and 2 GB 
memory is used for computation. Depending on the slab 
numbers in Region II, the computation speed is about 2 or 3 
data points per second.  
The FDTD method can also directly solve Maxwell’s 
equations and is a central difference scheme in both time and 
space domains with the second-order accuracy. In this study, 
one-dimensional slits are solved in two-dimensional space and 
equivalent real properties rather than complex dielectric 
function is adapted. Detail numerical scheme, periodic boundary 
treatment, and perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary 
condition can be found in Refs. [25,27]. Although the efficiency 
of FDTD calculation is not as good as RCWA for periodic 
structures, the FDTD can deal with radiative properties of 
random rough surfaces [27]. The FDTD calculations were 
carried out on a 48-processor Beowulf cluster, and the mesh size 
used was 5 nm. Smaller size (2 nm) was also used to verify the 
accuracy but only insignificant deviation was found in results. 
The time step size was on the order of 10-16 seconds following 
the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy criterion [20].

slit array in vacuum with double square features

Fig. 3 The TM wave transmittance through 110-nm-thick freestanding Au slit arrays at normal incidence. Although the period (Λ) 
of slits is fixed to 800 nm, the slit width (w) varies and square features may attach at either (single convex) or both (double 
convexes) sides: (a) w = 50, 100, 200, and 300 nm without feature; (b) w = 300 nm with 10, 30, and 50 nm square features; 
(c) w = 100 nm with a = 10 and a = 30 nm square features; (d) w = 50 nm with a = 10 and a = 15 nm square features. 
 
 The transmittance through 100-nm-wide slit with or 
without features is shown in Fig. 3(c). Since the slit width 
significantly reduces, the transmittance also decreases, 
especially at short wavelengths. The value of reduction is 
approximately proportional to the attached square size. 
However, the transmittance spectrum of double convexes shows 
abrupt change at λ ≈ 3 μm, but the change is not shown in other 
spectra. The exact wavelength of abrupt changes is not the same 
for different square sizes. Further investigation on these changes 
will be carried out later. Due to these changes, the transmittance 
at short wavelengths is the same for 10 nm single convex and 
double convexes attachment. Note that the slit opening is only 
40 nm wide for double attached a = 30 nm convexes, but its 
transmittance in the whole spectrum is still larger than that 
through 50-nm-wide slits as shown in Fig. 3(a). In this case, the 
narrow opening may not block transmittance as effectively as 
slits of the same narrow width.   
Transmittance through 50-nm-wide slits with the square 
feature size of a = 10 or 15 nm is shown in Fig. 3(d). One 
interesting effect of such narrow slits is that attached features 
reduce transmittance more significantly at long wavelengths 
than at short ones. When the length size of square enlarges from 
a = 10 to a = 15 nm, the transmittance modifies a little for single 
convex attachment. On the other hand, the abrupt changes in 
spectra for double convexes become significant. Specifically, 
the transmittance through slits with a = 15 nm square 
attachment is sometimes larger (λ ≈ 10.5 μm) or very close (λ ≈ 
5.5 μm) to that with a = 10 nm squares. In order to study unique 
radiative properties systematically, the representative slits with 
double a = 10 nm square attachment are selected.

the incidence propagates in the same direction as z-axis. 
Dimensions of all slits are the same as those of representative 
slits, except attached features are different. Three types of 
feature variation include no features for Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), 
double a = 10 nm convexes for Figs. 6(c) and 6 (d), and double 
a = 15 nm convexes for Figs. 6(e) and 6(f). The magnitude of 
complex magnetic field is shown in Figs. 6(a), 6(c), and 6(e), 
while the magnitude of normalized time-averaged Poynting 
vector is plotted in other three figures. The wavy patterns may 
come from the spatial resolution of data points (5 nm) and 
should not affect radiative properties. Obviously, only Figs. 6(c) 
and 6(d) show unique patterns like standing waves within slits. 
The attached features do not act as those in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f) to 
block the incidence. On the contrast, magnitudes of the 
magnetic field and Poynting vector seem to be higher than those 
shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). In this case, the incidence may 
penetrate the features freely and excite resonance. 
Further steps are taken to see how the transmittance is 
funneled through slits and where the energy is absorbed. In Fig. 
7, the time-averaged Poynting vectors around slit region are 
plotted for slits at normal incidence discussed previously. 
Metallic strips and features are also marked with semi-
transparent shadows for reading convenience. The arrows tell 
directions of the Poynting vector and indicate the path of net 
energy flow. The magnitude of Poynting vector inside slits is 
greater than that of Regions I and III and is marked with longer 
arrows. In Fig. 7(a), the energy is squeezed into the narrow slits 
with negligible transmittance through metallic strips. Poynting 
vectors inside the slit are aligned well with the same magnitude, 
except those locate around strip corners. Those vectors show the 
largest magnitude among all vectors may due to the abrupt 
change material properties [6]. In Fig. 7(b), the Poynting vectors 
inside slits are not well-aligned and the magnitude is not same 
all the way through slits. Some Poynting vectors may even 
penetrate the attached features leading to the induced 
absorptance. After partial energy is absorbed due to the attached 
features, the transmittance through slits is therefore reduced 
such that the transmittance through slits in Fig. 7(b) is the 
smallest. However, when the feature size is further enlarged as 
shown in Fig. 7(c), the Poynting vector cannot penetrate 
features but squeeze into the narrow opening. Therefore, the 
transmittance is lower than that in Fig. 7(a).        
Poynting vectors for the same slits at oblique incidence 
with θ = 45° are also plotted in Fig. 8. The figures are a little 
zoomed out to illustrate the oblique Poynting vectors. The 
values of absorptance (A) and transmittance (T) are listed in 
each figure for reference. Similar to the previous figures, only 
Poynting vectors in Fig. 8(b) can penetrate the attached features 
leading to higher absorptance. In contrast, only vectors around 
inlet corners penetrate a little into metal strips and square 
features in Figs. 8(a) and 8(c), respectively. On the other hand, 
the transmittance is also the smallest while it is close to that in 
Fig. 8(c). Caution should be paid when the reflectance is 
considered for slits in Fig. 8(b). Since the effects of absorptance 
increment and reduced transmittance may compensate each 
other, the lowest reflectance is from slits in Fig. 8(a). 
Interestingly, Poynting vectors within slits mainly align 
vertically even at oblique incidence. After funneling through 
slits, Poynting vectors then gradually change their orientation 
and propagate in the same direction as that of incidence. It is 
clear that Fig. 8 again explains unique radiative properties of 
slits with selected features, even at oblique incidence.
