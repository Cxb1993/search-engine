Fourier transform of the key mask must be 
a phase-only function in the Fourier plane 
to pass the spectrum energy of the primary 
image. However, in JTC optical encryption, 
a phase-only mask is inverse Fourier 
transformed to the spatial plane and 
truncated into a small window, which is 
usually smaller than one-half of the input 
plane. As a result of this truncation, the key 
mask is no longer a phase-only mask in the 
Fourier plane. To solve this problem, one 
needs to find a key mask such that its 
energy is limited in a small window of the 
spatial domain and its Fourier transform is 
as close as possible to a phase-only function 
with unit amplitude. Thus, we examine the 
properties of the key mask for perfect 
reconstruction and call such a mask a 
spatial-limited phase-only mask (SLPM). 
With the SLPM properties in mind, we 
introduce a discrete sinc function 
interpolation algorithm for the pure random 
phase mask in the Fourier domain. The 
resulting mask yields a good reconstruction 
result for the decrypted image. 
 
2. Design of the key mask. 
The optical encryption system based on 
the JTC structure is displayed in Fig. 1. Let 
 and  denote the input 
random phase code and the image to be 
encrypted and  represent the key 
mask. The input random phase code has 
unit amplitude transmittance, and the 
complex key mask is the inverse Fourier 
transform of the random phase key mask 
, which has unit amplitude 
transmittance in the frequency domain. In 
the encryption process,  and 
 are placed jointly in the input plane 
at

joint power spectrum (JPS) is given by the 
Fourier spectrum of the input and written as

Specifically, the joint power spectrum can

the decryption process, the key mask 
 is putted at the origin of the input

work, we will try to find the key mask 
based on these properties and apply it to the 
JTC image encryption system for the 
accurate recovery. Let us consider that the 
purely random phase function

sampling by using sinc function 
interpolation up to . It is 
equivalent to the zero padding on the 
spatial-domain from  to . This led 
to the second property of the key mask. 
Thus, the problem of finding the key mask 
for accuracy recovery can be viewed as a 
sinc function interpolation problem in the 
Fourier domain. Next, we will discuss the 
interpolation algorithm for generating the 
key mask to satisfy the desired properties.

Here, we use Fig. 2 to illustrate the basic 
procedure for designing the SLPM mask for 
the optical encryption system. First, an 
initial distribution of the signs of the phase 
distribution ( )qpH ,  at the regular sample 
points is designed to satisfy the constraints 
of Eq. (4) for the SLPM mask In light of the 
third property of maximum randomness for 
the key mask, the arrangement of the phase 
distribution of the regular sample points 
must be as irregular as possible. We thus 
revisit the regular sample to check whether 
the 4-adjacent regular sample points have 
the same phase. If they do, we can reverse 
the signs of the phase difference around this 
regular sample without violating the 
condition given by Eq. (4). The probability 
of sign reversal is chosen to be 0.5 to 
maximize the randomness of the random 
phase distribution. This process increases 
the randomness of the phase function in the 
frequency domain. After that, the full-size 
random phase key mask  is 
obtained from the upper sampling of the 
phase distribution . The resulting 
key mask 
( vuH , )
