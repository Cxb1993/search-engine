本研究主要使用反應性磁控共濺鍍法以金屬靶材在不同基板溫度下製備透明導電氧化銦鋅(IZO)薄
膜，並將 IZO 薄膜試片執行 RTA 真空退火熱處理在 300 - 600oC 持溫 5 分鐘，探討 IZO 薄膜之結構、
電性與光學特性的影響。由 XRD 結果得知基板未加溫之 IZO 薄膜呈現非晶質結構，當基板溫度大於
150oC 時薄膜呈現多晶的 In2O3結構，且結晶結構隨基板加熱溫度增加而提升薄膜的結晶性。IZO 薄
膜在可見光範圍內平均穿透率可達 80%以上，當薄膜在真空中熱處理對於薄膜穿透率變化不大，而
在還原氣體中當熱處理溫度過高氧氣被大量還原會有微量 In 析出，導致穿透率明顯下降。熱處理製
程能有效的降低 IZO薄膜的電阻值，最佳製程參數為基板未加熱通入O2流量為 10 sccm所製備的 IZO
薄膜，經 RTA 在真空中以 600oC 熱處理 5 分鐘後之薄膜，其結晶結構仍為非晶質結構，可得最低電
阻率 6.1×10-4 Ωcm，穿透率達 81.7%和平坦的表面形貌。 
關鍵詞：透明導電氧化物、反應性磁控濺鍍、ZnO、In2O3 
 
1. 前言 
透明導電薄膜 (Transparent Conductive Oxide Thin Film, 
TCO) 具有高可見光穿透率、極佳導電特性，被廣泛應用於
各種光電元件，應用範圍廣泛涵蓋平面顯示器面板、太陽能
吸收面板、觸控式面板與光電偵測器等。透明導電薄膜於可
見光範圍(波長為400~800 nm)具有高於80%之高穿透率及良
好的導電性質(電阻率低於1×10−3 Ωcm) 等特性。 
目前透明導電薄膜的應用以氧化銦錫(Indium Tin Oxide, 
ITO)[1-2]為主流，而同樣具有高穿透率和高導電特性的氧化
銦鋅(Indium Zinc Oxide, IZO)[3-5]，其成本低、低毒性、相
對有較低的沉積溫度，製程溫度在 300°C 以下仍呈現非晶
質 (Amorphous)，在元件製程中薄膜內部呈現較低的殘留應
力與維持較低薄膜粗糙度，提高了 IZO 薄膜在光伏太陽能
電池與顯示器材料應用的潛力。IZO除了擁有高導電度與高
穿透光率外[3]，其低製程溫度[6]與高薄膜表面平整度[7]等
優點使其越來越受到重視。透明導電膜導電性的來源，常利
用掺雜多一價或少一價之元素，或改變熱處理的氣氛 (如真
空、氮氣或氫氣)，經熱處理後使晶格生成氧空缺(Oxygen 
Vacancy)[8]來增加載子濃度(Carrier Concentration)與電子移
動率(Hall Mobility)繼而提高導電性。 
以往IZO製備皆使用In2O3:ZnO靶材，而使用金屬靶直接
製備IZO薄膜鮮有研究。使用金屬靶材之優點為 (1)金屬靶
材成本低於氧化物靶材，材料取得容易 (2)金屬靶材在濺鍍
製程中不會有氧化物靶材龜裂的問題[9] (3)容易製作大面積
靶材，以利大面積薄膜製備。本實驗採用In及Zn金屬靶材，
以反應性磁控共濺鍍方式取代目前氧化物靶材(In2O3:ZnO)
製備透明導電膜之技術，以克服大面積氧化物靶材製作不
易，且在濺鍍製程中容易因為離子撞擊或製程溫度提升而導
致靶材龜裂的問題，並利用RTA在還原氣氛或真空環境中熱
處理，探討熱處理參數對薄膜的結晶結構、光學性質與導電
性之影響。 
 
2. 實驗方法 
本研究使用康寧Eagle2000玻璃基板，以丙酮用超音波震
盪15分鐘，超純水用超音波震盪15分鐘後以N2吹乾試片後，
將試片置入磁控濺鍍腔體中進行薄膜沉積，使用金屬靶材作
反應性磁控濺鍍，當腔體真空度到達4 × 10-6 torr以下再通入
氬與氧氣之混合氣體(Ar : O2 = 10 : 10 sccm)，玻璃基板與靶
材之工作距離為10 cm。In靶使用DC磁控濺鍍功率25 W，Zn
靶使用RF磁控濺鍍功率10 W，在工作壓力保持在2 × 10-3 torr
下，分別在不同基板溫度下(不加熱、150oC、300oC)沉積IZO
薄膜一個小時。將不同基板溫度沉積之試片使用RTA作真空
結構為In2O3的多晶結構，在500oC以下XRD繞射峰有稍微往
高角度偏移，當溫度繼續提升到600oC有輕微的金屬In(101)
繞射峰產生。 
此IZO薄膜在Ar+H2環境中熱處理後結構變化。由圖1與
圖2可以看出，在Ar+H2環境中熱處理後會提早出現結晶結
構，H2具有大量還原薄膜內部O2的能力[16]，所以薄膜提早
發生O2原子往外擴散，使晶格位置由於產生氧空缺使晶格變
形而縮小平面間距，而繞射峰也提早往高角度偏移，當過度
還原氧氣時IZO薄膜形成純金屬In析出，由於結構改變使薄
膜內應力產生變化，導致In2O3的XRD繞射峰角度不再往高
角度偏移或有稍微往低角度偏移現象產生，可以看出熱處理
環境為Ar+H2還原氣體下使薄膜結晶溫度提早，甚至造成金
屬的In析出影響IZO之薄膜特性，顯示薄膜在還原氣氛下會
比在真空下對於薄膜結構影響較為劇烈。

環境中熱處理，電阻率在8.75×104 - 1.65×10-3 Ωcm之間，載
子濃度為2.50×1011 - 2.06×1020 cm-3，而霍爾移動率則介於
2.16 - 394.33 cm2/V‧sec之間。圖3(f)為基板加熱300oC下
Ar+H2環境中熱處理，當熱處理500oC以下隨溫度增加電阻率
有下降的趨勢，電阻率在9.46×10-1 - 2.34×10-3 Ωcm之間，在
600oC時電阻率上升為2.81×10-3 Ωcm，載子濃度為3.89×1018 - 
產生重疊情形，釋放了底部被侷限的電子使能隙減少所造
成。圖4(b)與4(c)分別為基板加熱150oC與300oC沉積之IZO薄
膜，隨著熱處理溫度增加而有偏向短波長區漂移的趨勢，符
合伯斯坦-摩斯學說[21]。圖4(d)(e)(f)分別為室溫、150oC與
300oC下沉積之IZO薄膜以不同溫度Ar+H2熱處理，IZO薄膜
在還原氣氛會比真空中執行熱處理明顯的讓穿透率提早下
降，由於H2有強力的還原效果容易使氧擴散還原，所以Ar+H2
環境在較低的熱處理溫度時，便會形成氧空缺使電阻率明顯
下降載子濃度上升，在低溫熱處理時對穿透率影響並不大，
在較高溫度熱處理由於O2過度還原造成In的析出或蒸發，導
致鍵結結構變化使吸收邊緣發生紅移現象，在Oh et al.研究
中指出[22]，透明導電薄膜可以在較低的處理溫度下藉由H2
退火處理有效的改善薄膜的電性及光學特性。

形貌，圖中可以看出試片表面已有明顯的晶界產生，由圖中
計算得結晶的晶粒尺寸約為13.9 nm，圖5(d)在RTA真空
600oC熱處理5分鐘的表面形貌，計算得結晶的晶粒尺寸約為
16.5 nm，XRD繞射圖1(b)證實呈現多晶的In2O3結構。圖5(e)
為基板加熱300oC所製備的IZO薄膜初鍍膜的表面形貌，由圖

由圖4可以明顯看出IZO薄膜，在室溫下製備之薄膜表面平整
且沒有晶界，結構為非晶質結構，當基板加熱到150oC時可
以看出表面已有明顯晶界，當基板加熱到300oC時可以看出
晶粒有比150oC成長，晶粒明顯呈現兩種尺寸(大晶粒與小晶

443.70 eV。由圖4.34可以看出其初鍍膜In3d5/2軌域鍵結能量
最高，基板加熱150oC初鍍膜鍵結能量較靠近In2O3鍵結的In3+
鍵結的444.6 eV，而基板加熱300oC薄膜再初鍍膜時即有氧空
缺產生，所以鍵結能量低於In2O3鍵結，於當薄膜經過Ar+H2
熱處理熱處理後則鍵結能幾乎為純In的鍵結能態443.7 eV，
由XRD觀察得知IZO薄膜有金屬In析出，而真空熱處理薄膜
鍵結能介於In與In2O3之間，主要是其In2O3結構氧空缺產生使
鍵結能量往低能量位置偏移。

1. Introduction 
The transparent conducting oxide (TCO) films have been widely applied in many fields, such 
as transparent electrodes used on liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) or solar cells, organic light emitting 
displays (OLEDs) and electroluminescence devices due to their high electrical conductivity and 
high visible transparence [1-3]. The intentional doping with difference elements is to increase in the 
conductivity of the TCOs such as Sn-doped In2O3 (ITO), Zn-doped In2O3 (IZO), Al-doped ZnO 
(AZO), or post-annealing under difference ambient such as vacuum, air and Ar + H2. The annealing 
process is affecting the local atomic configuration which leaves an oxygen vacancy-like defect. The 
oxygen vacancy-like defects are the primary source of carriers in these amorphous thin films [4]. 
Although there have been many studies on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) films [5] with the 
lowest available resistivity (1 - 2 × 10−4 Ωcm) at elevated substrate temperatures (250 - 350oC). 
Recently, several advantages of indium zinc oxide (IZO) films have been reported with entirely 
amorphous structure under the wide range of the deposition conditions. These amorphous IZO films 
[6-8] were reported to have good conductivity, high visible transparence, and low deposition 
temperature. Besides, excellent surface smoothness [6, 9] and high etching rate [10] for amorphous 
IZO thin films have been discussed. Therefore, the IZO is expected to be a new candidate for 
transparent electrode for solar cells. 
Traditional TCO thin film was usually prepared using a ceramic target, which is much 
expensive and much difficult in preparing a large area target than that a pure metallic target. 
Besides, the deposition rate is limited by the maximum power density due to the tolerable thermal 
load for the targets [11]. Reactive sputtering of metallic targets has been adopted to encounter the 
limitations of ceramic targets. In this work, we have reported on the ongoing development of 
reactive magnetron co-sputtering from metallic In and Zn targets by examining the influence of its 
structural change, electrical and optical properties. This is important in view of the cost reduction 
and the prevention of target creaking. This work aims at investigating the influence of preparing 
parameters using co-sputtering by metallic targets on the structural, electrical and optical properties 
of IZO thin films. Studied Indium Zinc Oxide thin film had a high transmittance above 80% and a 
low resistivity of 6.1 × 10-4 Ωcm when the film was deposited under 10 sccm oxygen partial 
pressure and following a 600oC post-annealing. 
 
2. Experimental  
IZO films were prepared on Corning Eagle2000 glass substrates by a reactive magnetron 
co-sputter deposition using metallic In (99.995% purity) and Zn (99.95% purity) targets. The base 
pressure in the vacuum chamber was lower than 5.0 × 10-6 torr, and the working pressure was 2 × 
10-3 torr during sputtering at Ar:O2 flows rate of 14:6 (O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3) and 10:10 sccm  
(O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5), respectively. The sputtering power of In was 25 W using a direct current (dc) 
power supply, and that of Zn was 10 W using a radio frequency (rf) power supply. The substrate 
temperature was held at ambient temperature. The thickness of IZO films of the O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3 
and 0.5 were 168 and 75 nm, respectively. Following deposition, the studied samples were annealed 
in vacuum at a temperature range from 300 oC to 600 oC for 5 min using a rapid thermal annealer 
(RTA).  
deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 and subsequently annealed at 600oC. The AFM image shows that 
Ra surface roughness of the IZO film over the area of 1 × 1 µm was 1.427 nm. Besides, the 
FESEM image (inset in Fig. 2) shows that studied IZO film had a smooth surface and where grain 
sizes were not clearly observable, indicating that IZO film was amorphous. 
Figure 3 shows the variations of the resistivity (ρ), the carrier concentration (n) and the Hall 
mobility (μ) of the studies thin films depending on the post-annealed temperature. The as-deposited 
IZO thin film had a high resistivity, exhibiting that the high resistivity of as-deposited film is 
attributed to its disorder structure, which is arisen from the low diffusivity of the arriving atoms 
onto unheated substrate. This deteriorates the crystallinity of the films and reduces the 
concentration of electrically active donor sites [9]. The increased scattering centers of electrons 
were responsible for the decreasing in Hall mobility and increasing in the resistivity. Figure 3(a) 
shows the Hall measurement results of the IZO films deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3 without 
substrate heating and post-annealed in vacuum at an elevated temperature for 5 min. The resistivity 
of the film slightly increased when the film was annealed at 300oC and sharply decreased upon 
annealing at 400oC. Besides, the mobility decreased when the film was annealed at and below 
500oC. The carrier concentration increased abruptly with increasing temperature upon annealing at 
400oC. Regardless a decrease in the mobility after the post annealing in vacuum, the resistivity 
decreased drastically at above 400oC, which can be attributed to the increase in carrier 
concentration. Figure 3(b) shows Hall measurement results of the IZO films deposited under 
O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 without substrate heating and post-annealed in vacuum at an elevated temperature 
for 5 min. The resistivity of deposited film slightly increased when the film was annealed at 300oC 
and sharply decreased with increasing in post-annealed temperature at above 400oC. Besides, the 
mobility and carrier concentration slightly decreased when the film was annealed at 300oC. The 
carrier concentration sharply increased with increasing annealed temperature upon annealing at 
400oC.  
The increase in carrier concentration by the post-annealing in vacuum is correlated to the 
generation of oxygen vacancies or interstitials, suggesting that the carrier concentration of the 
studied amorphous IZO films should be mainly dominated by the oxygen vacancies and interstitial 
Zn2+ ions. The resistivity of 6.1 × 10-4 Ωcm can be obtained when the film was deposited under 
O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 and subsequently annealed at 600oC in vacuum, however, the resistivity of  3.8 × 
10-2 Ωcm can be obtained for the film was deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3. The resistivity of the 
studied IZO film was very sensitive to the deposition O2/(Ar+O2) ratio, which was attributed to the 
oxygen deficiency in the IZO film. The resistivity (ρ) is proportional to the reciprocal of the product 
of carrier concentration (n) and Hall mobility (μ) as the following relation [13]: 
μρ ne
1=                                                        (1) 
where e is Columbic constant of 1.6 × 10-19 C. The decreasing in resistivity and increasing in carrier 
concentration suggested that oxygen vacancy-like defect is the primary source of carriers when the 
film was annealed in vacuum. The description of oxygen vacancy in crystalline indium oxide 
materials is [4]: 
The absorption edge for direct interband transition is given by [13]: 
 
αhν = C(hν – Eg)1/2                                              (3) 
 
where α is the optical absorption coefficient, which is given from dividing absorbance by film 
thickness, hν is the photon energy, and C is a constant for a direct transition. The optical energy 
band gap (Eg) can be obtained by the extrapolation of the linear region from a plot of (αhν)2 vs. hν 
[14]. The energy band gaps (Eg) of the IZO films were ranging from 3.57 eV to 3.65 eV for the IZO 
films deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3 without substrate heating and post-annealed in vacuum at 
an elevated temperature for 5 min, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Figure 5(b) displays the energy band gaps 
(Eg) of the IZO films were ranging from 3.42 eV to 3.36 eV for the IZO films deposited under 
O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 without substrate heating and post-annealed in vacuum at an elevated temperature 
for 5 min. The energy band gap (Eg) is the energy required for exciting an electron from valence 
band to the conduction band. The film deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 had a lower energy band 
gap and a lower electrical resistivity than that of the film prepared under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.3, 
suggesting that the free carriers might occupy the states at the bottom of the conduction band. The 
slightly change in energy band gap after annealing the film was correlated to the changing in the 
carrier concentration and the shifting of the Fermi level to below the band edge [8]. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This work prepares high conductivity amorphous indium zinc oxide (IZO) thin films using a 
reactive magnetron co-sputtering from metallic In and Zn targets in Ar/O2 mixture ambient. The 
as-deposited film exhibits an amorphous structure and this amorphous structure remains thermally 
stable at an elevated temperature. The IZO film deposited under O2/(Ar+O2) = 0.5 has a lowest 
resistivity of 6.1×10-4 Ωcm when the film was annealed at 600˚C in vacuum. The low resistivity of 
the studied film is attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies or interstitial Zn2+ ions, and 
hence increasing the carrier concentration of the IZO films for the film annealed under vacuum. The 
average visible transmittance of IZO films is above 80% for before and after annealing the film. 
The electrical and optical properties of the studied IZO film deposited using metallic targets 
strongly rely on deposition ambient and the subsequently annealing.

Abstract 
The failure mechanism of the TaCoN barrier for copper metallization was examined using 
films by direct current (dc) magnetron reactive sputtering at various nitrogen flow rates. The 
as-deposited TaCoN films had a glassy structure and were free from intermetallic compounds. 
Optimizing the nitrogen flow rate during sputtering maximized the thermal stability of the 
Si/Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8/Cu metallization system up to an annealing temperature of 750oC when the film 
was deposited using a nitrogen flow rate of 1 sccm, as revealed by using X-ray diffraction, a 
scanning electron microscope, a four-point probe and a transmission electron microscope. Structural 
analysis indicated that the failure mechanisms of the studied Si/TaCoN/Cu stacked films involved 
the initial dissociation of the barrier layer that was annealed at a specific temperature, and the 
subsequent formation of diffusion paths along which the copper penetrates through the TaCoN 
barrier layer to react with underlying Si. The high formation temperature of the Cu3Si phase 
INTRODUCTION 
Copper (Cu) has been used as an interconnect material in ultra-large-scale integrated circuits 
(ULSI) owing to its greater electrical conductivity and electromigration (EM) resistance than 
aluminum.1,2 In particular, the high electromigration resistance of copper supports a higher current 
density in the copper metallization. In the integrated circuit (IC) chip, using copper instead of 
aluminum to make the metal interconnections reduces the consumption of electric power and 
increases the speed of integrated circuits by 19%.3,4 However, Cu diffuses easily into silicon and 
silicon dioxide, forming Cu intermetallic compounds at a low temperature. The strong interaction 
between Cu and Si degrades the copper metallization perfoemance.5 Thus, a barrier layer between 
Cu and Si must be implemented.  
Among barrier materials, transition metal nitride is frequently used owing to its high hardness, 
chemical inertness and thermal stability.6,7 Crystalline Ta and TaN thin films are the most promising 
diffusion barriers for preventing the highly diffusive copper from the penetrating the barrier to react 
with silicon.8-11 Sputter-deposited TaN is most commonly used as the diffusion barrier owing to its 
good thermal stability at a high temperature and limited solid solubility in Cu. The failure of a TaN 
barrier layer is often caused by its columnar structure, and the grain boundaries tend to provide 
diffusion paths for Cu, thus penetrating through the barrier.12 Recently, glassy thin films have been 
investigated as an effective diffusion barrier owing to their lack of grain boundaries.13-16 Hence, a 
barrier layer with a glassy structure has great potential for preventing Cu diffusion. Tantalum and 
cobalt alloys are expected to have promising characteristics as diffusion barriers because of the 
chamber were 2.7×10-6 torr and 5×10-3 torr, respectively. The dc power was maintained at 50 W. 
The working distance (distance between the target and the substrate) was 65 mm. To complete the 
metallization schemes, a Cu layer (100 nm) was subsequently deposited onto the 20 nm-thick 
TaCoN layer by sputtering under 20 sccm Ar ambient on unheated substrate without breaking the 
vacuum. 
The samples were annealed at different temperature ranging from 400 to 900oC in a vacuum 
for 5 min. The variation in the sheet resistance of the sample was measured using a four-point probe. 
The structural change of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα 
radiation. The compositions of the films were determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy 
(EDS). The depth profile of the stacked film was then detected using Auger Electron Spectrometer 
(AES). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the 
film. Finally, interfaces at the Si/TaCoN/Cu stacked films were characterized by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Resistivity and Composition of TaCoN Thin Film 
Table 1 lists the resistivities and compositions of the ternary TaCoN thin films that were 
sputtered under N2 at various flow rates. The nitrogen content of the TaCoN thin films increased 
monotonically when increasing the nitrogen flow rate. This finding reveals that the nitrogen flow 
rate during sputtering only slightly influenced the nitrogen content in TaCoN films. The resistivities 
lower than that of the film deposited at 8 sccm because the films had identical compositions, as was 
also observed in the reactive sputtered ZrCN film.19  
 
Thermal Stability of the Si/TaCoN/Cu Stacked Films 
Since the resistivity of the TaCoN film substantially exceeds that of Cu, the resistivity of the 
TaCoN thin film is assumed not to contribute to the electrical resistivity of the Si/TaCoN/Cu 
stacked film. Since the electrical resistivity of copper is 1.67 μΩcm, the variation in the sheet 
resistance with temperature, ΔR, (ΔR = (Rf – Ro)/Ro × 100%), where Rf is the sheet resistance after 
the annealing of the sample, and Ro is the sheet resistance before annealing, can thus be used to 
determine the failure temperature of the stacked films that are associated with the sheet resistance of 
Cu, TaCoN and their intermetallic compounds, which vary markedly. Accordingly, the change in the 
ΔR may represent changes in the structure of Cu film and the degree of intermixing between copper 
and the underlying film.  
Figures 2 (a) and (b) plot the variation in ΔR of the Si/TaCoN/Cu stacked samples during RTA 
annealing between 500 to 750oC for 5 min. The dependence of ΔR on the annealing temperature 
implies the reaction or intermixing at interfaces of the stacked films, associated with the formation 
of intermetallic compounds. The low resistivity of the Si/TaCoN/Cu films demonstrates that they 
are thermally stable on the TaCoN film and no reaction occurs between the copper film and the 
TaCoN layer. However, an abrupt increase in ΔR suggests that a reaction occurred, as verified by 
XRD. The TaCoN layer failed to prevent the diffusion of copper into the Si substrate. Figure 2 (a) 
through the barrier. When the optimum amount of nitrogen (at a flow rate of 1 sccm during 
sputtering) was introduced into a Ta-Co film, the ΔR depends on the barrier layers annealed with 
various Co contents (TaN, TaCoN (RA = 7.3) and TaCoN (RA = 11.5)), as shown in Fig. 3. An 
optimum Co content (RA = 11.5 in this study) is essential to the barrier effect, which prevents the 
diffusion of Cu. However, increasing the Co content (RA = 7.3) reduced the barrier ability of the 
TaCoN layer, which is poor than that of TaN. However, determining ΔR primarily yields the state 
of the Cu overlay, since this overlay carries almost all of the probe currents. Hence, the interaction 
between the layers may not be immediately detected via ΔR. 
The films were further examined by the XRD method to evaluate the thermal stability and 
structural changes. Structural examination by XRD indicated that the as-deposited TaCoN films 
were amorphous (not shown). Figure 4 presents the XRD patterns of the Si/Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8/Cu 
stacked films (which had the best thermal stability of all of the studied films) that were annealed at 
different isothermal temperatures. Only Cu diffraction peaks were detected (JCPDS:04-0836) when 
the films were annealed at and below 700oC. The intensity of the Cu (111) diffraction peak 
exceeded that of the Cu (200) peak, indicating that the Cu film had a <111> texture. The copper 
diffraction peaks had the same 2θ values in all XRD spectra from the samples that were annealed at 
a temperature of 700oC and below, and no new phase formed in the specimens. Only Cu diffraction 
peaks were examined when the film was annealed at 700oC, as indicated in Fig. 4. This figure also 
reveals that the Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8 barrier film prevents the intermixing at the interface and the 
penetration of Cu into the underlying Si substrate. When the stacked film was annealed at 750oC, 
between copper and silicon,8 Fig. 5 (c) is believed to reveal that the 20 nm-thick Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8 
film was an effective diffusion barrier when the film was annealed at 700oC. Figures 5 (d) and (e) 
show the scanning electron micrograph of annealed Si/Ta58.7Co11.0N30.3/Cu and 
Si/Ta59.1Co8.1N32.8/Cu, respectively. The agglomeration of Cu grains and some pyramid-like defects 
occurs on the surface of the films. The formation of pyramid-like defects further depleted the Cu 
layer around the defects, producing a circular Cu depletion region. The depletion of the Cu surface 
is believed to react with underlying Si by forming the Cu3Si phase. Figure 5 (f) shows the surface 
image of the annealed Si/Ta51.0Co11.9N37.1/Cu film. The surface image of the Si/Ta51.0Co11.9N37.1/Cu 
film is similar to that of Si/Ta58.7Co11.0N30.3/Cu and Si/Ta59.1Co8.1N32.8/Cu. However, the enlarged 
Cu depletion region and more pyramid-like defects are found in the Cu-depleted region, indicating 
that the reaction between Cu and the underlying Si was stronger than that of Si/Ta58.7Co11.0N30.3/Cu 
and Si/Ta59.1Co8.1N32.8/Cu. The abrupt rise in the ΔR in Fig. 1 during annealing is believed to be 
caused by the serious reaction that forms the pyramid-like products, which are further examined by 
TEM. The SEM images in Fig. 5 reveal that the surface morphology of annealed 
Si/Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8/Cu film did not change significantly (Fig. 5(c)) while the other RA = 11.5 films 
exhibited many pyramid-like defects with sizes of several microns. The hillocks and pyramid-like 
defects on the Cu film were responsible for the increases in the change in the sheet resistance.  
A cross-sectional TEM investigation was conducted, as shown in Fig. 6, to elucidate the 
nature of the pyramid-like defects. The interface between the layers disintegrated and pyramidal 
defects were observed. According to the EDS results, the signal at the pyramidal defects yielded 
5 min. Cu was present only on the top surface of the film, while a sharp drop was found in toward 
the interface between Cu and Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8. A very low Cu content was detected within the 
Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8 and Si substrate, exhibiting that very little intermixing occurred when the film was 
annealed at 650oC. When the sample was annealed at 700oC, a slightly higher Cu content was 
detected at the interface between Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8 and the Si substrate, as shown in Fig. 7 (b), 
suggesting that some Cu diffused into TaCoN and the Si substrate. The interface of the stacked film 
still remained integrated. However, severe intermixing occurred as the annealing temperature was 
further increased to 750oC, as shown in Fig. 7 (c). This finding suggests that the Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8 
barrier layer failed to prevent the diffusion of Cu. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This study elucidates the behavior of the amorphous TaCoN thin films that are prepared by 
dc magnetron sputtering as a diffusion barrier for copper interconnections. Highly thermally stable 
amorphous TaCoN thin films are obtained, and the Si/Ta66.8Co11.4N21.8/Cu stacked film has a failure 
temperature of up to 750oC. The failure mechanism of the barrier film involves the initial 
dissociation of the barrier film by the formation of CoSi at an elevated isothermal temperature, 
which is accompanied by the penetration of Cu through the barrier layer to react with the 
underlying Si substrate. Results of this study demonstrate that the feasibility of using the sputtered 
TaCoN films as an effective diffusion barrier for Cu metallization.
