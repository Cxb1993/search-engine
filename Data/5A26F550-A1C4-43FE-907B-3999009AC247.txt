英文摘要 
This project proposes a decentralized control 
methodology that not only allows the coordination of 
two mobile manipulators in executing cooperative 
task but also considers the cooperation stability and 
manipulability. The motion command is given to one 
of the robots, referred to as a leader, and the other 
robot referred to as follower which need to coordi-
nate its trajectory while maintaining the grasp. 
Moreover, we apply the compliant motion control to 
both manipulators to compensate for the platform’s 
position errors while maintaining prescribed internal 
forces. In addition to the cooperative control, we use 
a hybrid system approach to model the execution of 
cooperative tasks when there are obstacles in the en-
vironment. Hybird systems combine discrete event 
and continuous dynamics in a manner that can cap-
ture decision logic, agent dynamics, and inter-agent 
communication in a unified modelling framework, 
which is adequate to represent cooperative robot sys-
tem. We utilize a hybrid automaton to specify the 
behavior of each robot, which allows us to better 
describe and formalize the execution of cooperative 
task. Finally, we give the simulation results to dem-
onstrate the effectiveness of the basic methodology 
and the hybrid system approach, respectively. 
 
1. Introduction 
Cooperation has been the key to success in most 
biological society, and we believe that to introduce 
cooperative capability into robotic systems is critical 
to realize the next generation supporting systems for 
human society. 
Recently, control of cooperative robots has been 
an active research field. Fundamentally, it consists 
of a group of robots working cooperatively to exe-
cute various types of tasks in order to increase the 
robustness and efficiency of task execution. The use 
of multi-robot teams brings several advantages 
compared to the single robot approaches. First, de-
pending on the type of the task, multiple robots can

Let Σw=(O,wX, wY, wZ) be the fixed frame of the world  
coordinates and Σv=(O,vX ,vY ,vZ) be the moving 
frame attached to the platform.

3.2 Kinematic Model of Mobile Platform 
The differential drive model is the most elaborate 
representation of a wheeled mobile robot. The con-
figuration of the system in general can be shown as: 
[ ]lryxq θθφ ,,,,=  
The three velocity level constraints reduce the 
system to a 2 degrees of freedom system at the veloc-
ity level, and the derivation of these constraints is 
shown in detail in the previous section. Thus, the 
three constraints may now be represented in matrix 
form as: 
0
0sincos

4. Cooperative control of mobile manipulators 
4.1 Define the Control Goal by Force Analysis 
The local force control structure at the i-th grasp 
point is 
iforceimotioni FFF ,, +=  (3) 
where the control vector, Fmotion,I, are designed so that 
the external forces produced by platform positioning 
errors are zero. And then, the vectors Fforce,I create 
forces at the grasp points, including external forces 
Fext,I applied to the manipulators and the specified 
internal forces Fint,I applied to the grasped object by 
the manipulators. 
, ,
, , int,( )
i motion i force i
motion i ext i i
F F F
F F F

= + +  (4) 
Subsequently, we want to design a controller to 
produce the desired position trajectories of the 
end-effector such that the external force will be com-
pensated. In other words, the goal of force control is 
that no external forces exist between manipulators 
and the object. 
Figure 2 shows the block diagram of compliant 
motion control. The task specification conditions are 
denoted as reference commands for the compliant 
controller which produces an adjustment trajectory 
for the end-effector in the vehicle coordinate frame. 
Moreover, the position controller in the inner loop is 
responsible for realizing the trajectory following.

This method, termed as “Virtual Robot Method”, 
assumes that a virtual unicycle robot generates the 
desired reference trajectory by a suitable selection of 
a forward velocity v and an angular velocity w. The 
overall goal is to find a control law that is a function 
of the states of the actual WMR and the time varying 
linear and angular velocity of the virtual robot. Ini-
tially, we will only consider the tracking problem and 
temporarily put the regulation problem aside. This 
translates to the requirement that the virtual reference 
robot is never at rest, because v and w never become 
zero simultaneously. Therefore, the control problem 
can be explained with the following equations:

Equation (12) represents the requirement that 
the error between the state of the actual robot and 
that of the reference robot tends to zero as time pro-
gresses. Upon transforming the errors in the Carte-
sian frame to the moving frame:

In the regulation problem, we will assume that the 
virtual reference robot moves along a path, which 
passes through a point (xr,yr) to which we seek to 
regulate  the system. As noted earlier, regulation 
cannot be directly handled by the previously defined 
control system because vr and wr become zero simul-
taneously. Hence, to cope with this challenge, the  
idea is to make vr or wr as time varying controls and 
dependent on the error such that convergence of the  
tracking  error to zero will incidentally ensure con-
vergence of the actual robot to the desired reference 
robot position. One suitable choice for the time vary-
ing control law recommended by Siciliano et al. is:

5. Simulation results 
Scenario 1: Linear Motion  
The second velocity profile being simulated is of 
a smoother, 2nd order continuous profile, which fea-
tures a “triangular” acceleration profile. This velocity 
profile is continuous to its 2nd order and results in a 
smoother acceleration. 
In the velocity cases, it is clear that the smoother 
the velocity is, the less interactive force there is. 
Moreover, the follower controller will be somewhat 
“oscillating” when there is abrupt velocity / accelera-
tion change. 
Scenario 2: Curvy Motion 
In this simulation, the leader robot courses itself 
over an arc with moderate velocity regulation but 
dose not produce excessive sideway acceleration. 
The follower robot executes the compliant motion 
control algorithm and guides itself over to the target 
without additional commands from the leader robot.
