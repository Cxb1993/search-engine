Multi-agents Negotiation Supported Inverse Manufacture System  
for Electric Vehicles 
 
Abstract 
This project will develop an Inverse Manufacture System (IMS) and the associated Inverse 
Dynamic Equipment (IDE) for multiple component-wise electric machines, where electric 
vehicles with four-wheel independent motoring and braking are used for targeted examples. 
Motivated by the research/design/maintenance planning in military industry, the proposed 
IMS is with five-layered architecture comprised of: mechanism and electromechanics; 
motoring and braking; control and sensing electronics; servo and communication; and 
behavior coordinators, from the outer layer to the inner layer. For the layers 4 and 5, this 
project proposes multi-agent negotiation –supported semi-empirically robust servos, and will 
explore its nature in the aspects of: energy management; sensing and communication; system 
construction; model identification; robustness and intelligence; and the trade-off between 
controller implementation and modeling intricacies. A comparison with the traditionally 
large-scaled controls will be performed. To this, we will design and manufacture through the 
IMS the distributed electronic transmission in conjunction with the four-wheel electronic 
differential to serve for a benchmark problem about why we need the multi-agent negotiation 
supported robust control rather than the large-scale decentralized control. For more persuaded 
results, this project furthers to design and manufacture an IDE to mimic the dynamics of the 
transmission & differential as though they were operated in a real situation. From the IDE, we 
are able to observe and acquisition transient/steady responses of mechanical motions, power 
flow and electronic signals in a real and real-timed fashion, based on which we are prepared 
to make strong concussions. And then we will write down a series of mathematical theorems 
that show the natural principles of this new robust control structure, and simultaneously 
improve the architecture of the inverse manufacturing system for electric machines or extend 
its application to pneumatic or hydraulic machines. 
 
Keywords: inverse engineering, multi-agent negotiation; semi-empirical robust synthesis; 
inverse dynamic equipment.

[16] designed bi-directional DC/DC power converters to “soften” switching of currents, 
which was later improved with four power MOSFETs [17]; Hofsajer et. al. [18] used RCD 
snubber to reduce energy consumption from high-frequency on-offs of power transistors; and 
He and Nelems [19] embedded microprocessors into power converters for optimal timing of 
switching to suppress electricity loss. In the fields of (a), (b) and (c), additional components 
are needed, as has been discussed, for the fulfilment of saving energy. 
On the other hand, additional hardware in the field of engineering (d) is unnecessary for 
improving economy in energy. Specifically, we can program a regulator of energy 
consumption into the microcontroller of the EM controller, an already existent component, to 
boost energetic economy. In literature, fuzzy logic [20], genetic algorithm [21], rule-based 
strategy [22], instantaneous optimisation strategy [23] and global optimisation strategy [24] 
are found as methods to make energy-saving programs. In this paper, we turn to consider the 
interaction between energy utilization and motion responses of EM dynamics, since, as we 
have experienced, an irrational emphasis of energetic economy will dull the motions, and vice 
versa. It is hoped that manufacturers can prepare a set of feedback-dynamics implemented in 
the microcontroller of the EM controller for a diversity of traffic conditions. For example, the 
EM can switch to the best mode of conserving energy for a less jammed traffic. 
Roughly speaking, we first examine based on a reduced version of mathematical model 
the particular personality of EM dynamics: the trade-off between economy-in-energy (EE) 
and quickness-in-motion (QM). The reduced model is then served for ∞H -control synthesis 
that treats the EE and QM as two players entering into negotiations with a negotiation 
parameter being assigned for quantification of the EE-QM trade-off of the controlled 
dynamics. The applicability of this quantification will pass examinations of computer 
simulations and road tests in this paper. In advance of road tests, we design and manufacture 
an industrial controller for the experiments that installs the EE-QM regulation.  
Including this introduction section, achievements of the work are presented with six

Figure 1 shows the equivalent circuit of the EM dynamics, where besides the equivalent 
inertia of moment J , other parameters such as equivalent inductance L , resistance R  and 
damping B  are identified in advance of control/observer syntheses. Chou et. al. [25] devised 
an inverse dynamics equipment to identify those parameters.

where τ m  stands for the time constant of mechanical parts BJ / ; u  for the maximum of 
average voltage across the motor; and ω  and i  for the steady-state tire speed and motor 
current, respectively, as the average voltage delivered by the power converter is kept at u . 
The motor voltage u  is identical to the voltage across the battery if the power converter of 
the controller adopts buck choppers. 
With the dimensionless setting of Eq. (2), the steady state of Eq. (1) signifies that 
ωρκ Bi =  and uiR =+ωρκ . Therefore, the non-dimensional state-space realization of the 
EM dynamics can be rewritten as

A smaller QM index 1γ  implies that the time for reaching referenced speed or acceleration is 
shorter, that is, the motion of EM is quicker under servocontrol. A smaller EE index 2γ  
means that heat dissipated from mechanical and electric resistances are less before the 
motions arrive at steady state. It is to be noted that the QM variable 1z  and the EE variable 
2z  include the motor voltage u  to protect it from becoming unreasonably large for 
regulating the EE and QM. 
With the introduction of new symbols above, the EM dynamics of Eq. (3) can be 
extended to the following generalised plant that incorporates the EE and QM performances:

Any quadruple ),,,( 21 γγYX  satisfying Eqs. (14)-(15) defines a feasible feedback 1−= YXK  
guaranteeing the performances of feedback dynamics to have QM index 1γ  and EE index 
2γ . It is easy to check that the set of feasible pairs of indexes ),( 21 γγ  is convex. 
Based on the convexity mentioned above, we provides a numerical procedure in the 
following to represent the set of feasible performances ),( 21 γγ  in a 2D plane coordinated by 
1γ  and 2γ : 
[Step 1] Assign a negotiation parameter α  and then set 12 αγγ =  in Eqs. (14)-(15). Involve 
the mincx.m routine in the Matlab LMI-lab toolbox to solve the optimal solution 
),,,( 21 γγYX  with a minimized 1γ . Mark the obtained point ),( 21 γγ  in the 1γ - 2γ  
2D plane, as shown in Figure 3, and the corresponding optimal feedback 1−= YXK  
for the α -negotiation.       
[Step 2] Choose a set of negotiation parameters α  and repeat Step 1 to obtain the 
corresponding set of optimal points ),( 21 γγ  in the 1γ - 2γ  2D plane. Connect those 
points into a curve of optimality. This curve divides the 1γ - 2γ  2D plane into two 
regions: feasible performances and infeasibility.  
For standard mechatronic ratios of AC characteristics β =150 and power ratings 
ϕ =325, the overall solutions of Eqs. (14)-(15) obtained through Steps 1 and 2 are 
demonstrated in Figure 3. Figure 3 represents in a non-dimensional fashion the personality of 
electric motorcycles: the trade-off between EE and QM. This vehicular personality has been 
commonly experienced, and can be parameterised with the ∞H -negotiation -based EE-QM

comparatively simpler structure of internal timers than DSP microprocessor and embeds A/D 
and PWM modules, so we did not apply Infinite Impulse Recursive (IIR) [27] for DSP 
implementation, either. Instead, the so-called matrix iteration time-fixed (MIT) [28] method is 
developed to implement control/observer dynamics, which is briefly described as follows.  
The MIT interprets a linear dynamics as an iterated operation of matrices:

the matrices ),( ΓΦ  of which are calculated by the continuous-to-digital mfile (c2d.m) with 
the holder of inputs being zero-order and the sampling time of outputs being sT . Note that 
the sampling time used in computer simulations is also set equal to sT . The time intervals 
from the instant the input ku  enters the A/D to the moment the output 1+ky  leaves the PWM 
are held fixed and equal to sT , too. This time-fixed approach renders the real-timed operation 
to match the computer-timed operation, therefore achieves robust implementation of feedback 
dynamics into microcontrollers even with A/D and PWM modules. The microprocessor 
between the A/D and PWM can adopt IEEE754 24-bits standard of floating number [27], 
which is comprised of the mantissa of 15 bits, the exponential of 8 bits and the sign of 1 bit. 
The range of exponential is –126 to 128, and thus the resolution of numbers is 2 to the power 
of 255, which is enough for the purpose of EM control. The addition and multiplication of 
floating numbers that are needed in the iterated operation of matrices can be refereed to the 
reference [29]. 
[Step 4] Include the microcontroller into an EM controller circuitry   
Figure 4 shows main components of an industrial EM controller. On the circuit board are 
(1) a current sensor; (2) a PIC chip embedded with A/Ds, PWMs and the MIT programs; (3) 
voltage regulators; (4) switching buck choppers; (5) sensor and transducer circuits; (6) the 
amplification circuits driving the gates of power MOSFETs in the choppers; and (7) starting 
and braking relays. Figure 5 provides readers the auxiliary circuit of PIC16F87X chips, which

0.2=α  and corresponding indexes ),( 21 γγ  being )42.3,71.1( . Figure 6 and Figure 7 
record the responses of road tests and that of computer simulations, respectively, of these two 
types of controllers. We find that Allegro ACS754SCB-200 Hall-effect current sensor is of 
wide bandwidth and, as of such, lures high-frequency noises into the loop. Though noises 
contaminate measurement, we can discern the coincidence between measured responses and 
simulated responses, which validates the accuracy of computer simulations upon the reduced 
EM dynamics with identified parameters for studying the personality of the considered EM. 
It is computationally convenient to change the independent variable of the EM dynamics 
in Eq. (3) from the time t  to the angular displacement θ  ( ωθ =dtd / ):

We simulate based on Eq. (16) the responses of energy consumption, motor current and tire 
speed versus the angular displacement θ  of the EM driven in a jammed traffic. Figure 8 and 
Figure 9 show situations in a short range and long range, respectively. Their responses of 
energy consumption indicate that the economic type ( 1.1=α ) saves about 25% energy with 
respect to the quick type ( 0.2=α ). Energy is saved because of reduced electric dissipation 
resulted from the depression of current overshoots during the acceleration and deceleration. 
This also protects the lead-acid battery from overcharging and the DC motor from overheating, 
and thus saves energy. That is out of the scope of this paper.   
In Figure 10, we plot the relationship between the amount of energy being saved and the 
negotiation parameter chosen in the EE-QM regulator. It is found that the percentage of 
energy saved with respect to the quick type ( 0.2=α ), η , is almost proportional to the 
reciprocal of negotiation parameter 1/α . This linear relationship verifies the practicability of 
taking negotiation parameters to parameterise the trade-off between EE and QM in EM
