conjugate. Noticeably, for 0 ≤ i ≤ K − 1, (z(2i),−z(2i +
1)∗) and (z(2i + 1), z(2i)∗) form a codeword of STBC. Let
z¯′=(z′(0),z′(1), · · · , z′(2K − 1)) be another codeword of
coded modulation. We define some distance measures between
z¯ and z¯′ and give their notations which will be used in the
remainder of this paper. The squared Euclidean distance and
Hamming (symbol) distance between z¯ and z¯′ are respectively
denoted by d2(z¯, z¯′) and dH(z¯, z¯′). The product distance
dP (z¯, z¯
′) is defined according to dP (z¯, z¯′)=
∏
i∈γ [|z(i) −
z′(i)|2], where γ is the set of all i for which z(i) 6= z′(i). It is
obvious that |γ| equals dH(z¯, z¯′). Now consider the Hamming
distance dH,2(z¯, z¯′) and product-sum distance dP,2(z¯, z¯′) over
span 2 between vectors z¯ and z¯′. Let η be the set of all
even i for which z(i) 6= z′(i) or z(i + 1) 6= z′(i + 1).
In [5], dH,2(z¯, z¯′) and dP,2(z¯, z¯′) are defined to be |η| and∏
i∈η[|z(i) − z
′(i)|2 + |z(i + 1) − z′(i + 1)|2], respectively.
Since T ′ is a TCM, in the remainder of this section, we will
consider the pairwise error probability (PEP), P (z¯ → z¯′), that
the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder decides in favor of the
codeword z¯′ instead of the transmitted codeword z¯ for the case
of TCM. The case of BICM in MIMO systems can be found
in [8].
B. Channel Models and Design Criteria
For quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels, where the fading
coefficients are constant during a frame, the PEP, P (z¯ → z¯′),
is bounded by [4][5]
P (z¯ → z¯′) ≤
[
Es
4N0
d2(z¯, z¯′)
]−2
(1)
where Es denotes the transmitted symbol energy from one
antenna and N0/2 denotes the power spectral density per
dimension of complex additive white Gaussian noise. For
fast fading channels, we assume that the channel fading is
constant in a time interval of duration 2Ts, but independently
varies from one time interval of 2Ts to another, where Ts is
one symbol duration. In addition, the fading statistic follows
the Rayleigh distribution. The PEP is bounded by [5]
P (z¯ → z¯′) ≤
[
Es
4N0
]−2dH,2(z¯,z¯′)
[dP,2(z¯, z¯
′)]

C. An Improved System and Its Design Criteria
The improved system is implemented by inserting a
2×K block interleaver (de-interleaver) between the encoders
(decoders) of TCM and STBC. Now consider the case of
fast fading channels. Let z¯ =(z(0),z(1), · · · , z(2K − 1))
represent the output codeword of coded modulation. With
such a 2×K block interleaver, the input to the STBC encoder
which is also the output of the block interleaver is z¯I =
(z(0), z(K), z(1), z(K + 1), · · · , z(K − 1), z(2K − 1)). For
the improved system, the PEP that the ML decoder decides in
favor of the code sequence z¯′ = (z′(0), z′(1), · · · , z′(2K−1))
instead of the transmitted code sequence z¯ is
dominated by dH,2(z¯I , z¯′I) and dP,2(z¯I , z¯′I). Since
dP,2(z¯I , z¯
′
I)=
∏
i∈η[|z(i)− z
′(i)|2 + |z(i+K)− z′(i+K)|2],
η is the set of all i, 0 ≤ i ≤ K − 1, for which z(i) 6= z′(i) or
z(i+K) 6= z′(i+K) and dH,2(z¯I , z¯′I)=|η|. If K is sufficiently
large, then the dominated error codeword z¯′ of the TCM will
have the property of z(i+K) = z′(i+K), i = 0, 1, · · · ,K−1.
Hence, we have dP,2(z¯I , z¯′I)=
∏
i∈η[|z(i)− z
′(i)|2]=dP (z¯, z¯
′)
and dH,2(z¯I , z¯′I)=dH(z¯, z¯′). Thus, the dominated PEP for the
improved system becomes
P (z¯ → z¯′) ≤
[
Es
4N0
]−2dH(z¯,z¯′)
[dP (z¯, z¯
′)]
−2
. (3)
Since dH(z¯, z¯′) ≥ dH,2(z¯, z¯′), the improved system in general
achieves larger diversity as compared to the original system
based on the same TCM.
D. TCM With A Delay Processor [9][10]
The encoder for an (m, r) convolutional code C con-
verts an input message sequence u¯ = {· · · , uˆ(0), uˆ(1), · · · }
to a sequence v¯ = {· · · , vˆ(0), vˆ(1), · · · }, where uˆ(t) =
(u1(t), · · · , ur(t)) and vˆ(t) = (v1(t), · · · , vm(t)) are bi-
nary r-tuples and m-tuples, respectively. The sequence v¯
is processed by the multilevel delay processor which pro-
duces a sequence s¯ = {· · · , sˆ(0), sˆ(1), · · · }, where sˆ(t) =
(s1(t), · · · , sm(t)) is a binary m-tuple. The sequence s¯ is
then fed into the signal mapper to yield a code sequence z¯
= {· · · , z(0), z(1), · · · } of T , where z(t) = ω(sˆ(t)) ∈ Ω
and Ω is a signal constellation consisting of 2m signal points.
Using Ungerboeck’s set-partitioning principle [12], we can
construct an m-level partition chain Ω0/Ω1/Ω2/ · · · /Ωm such
that every signal point z in Ω = Ω0 corresponds to a unique
binary m-tuple sˆ=(s1, s2, · · · , sm), i.e., z = ω(sˆ), where
z ∈ Ω and si, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, is the coset label of Ωi−1/Ωi.
Let ω(sˆ) and ω(sˆ′) denote two signal points which are in
the same coset of Ωj−1, but in distinct cosets of Ωj labelled
by sj = 1 and s′j = 0, respectively. Let ∆(ω(sˆ), ω(sˆ′))

similar error performance as compared to BICM with NI = 6.
III. 方法與成果: B部分
Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems are attractive
for their capability to significantly increase the transmission
capacity. MIMO-BICM (Bit interleaved coded modulation)
scheme, which is a space-time extension of the BICM [21],
is one of the approaches aimed at approaching the increased
capacity. In this project, we improve the convergence speed of
MIMO-BICM scheme by using a specific bit interleaver and
modifying the iterative decoding-detection algorithm. The soft
output of the sliding-widow SISO (soft-input and soft-output)
channel decoder can be fed back to the detector after a window
length and then the detector can immediately use these soft
values within the same iteration. Hence, the proposed MIMO-
BICM scheme can achieve a faster speed of convergence as
compared to the conventional MIMO-BICM scheme.
A. MIMO Channel Model
Let ⊤ and † denote the transpose and Hermitian trans-
pose, respectively. We consider a communication system with
Nt transmit and Nr receive antennas over a frequency-
nonselective Rayleigh block fading channel with coherence
length of T symbols. Within the coherence interval, the
l-th received signal vector is given by yl= Hxl + nl,
where yl = [ y0l y1l · · · y

the channel matrix, nl ∈ CNr×1 is the additive white complex
Gaussian random vector with E[nl] = 0, E[nln†l ] = N0INr .

B. System Description
Fig. 1 shows both the transmitter and receiver of the MIMO-
BICM scheme investigated in this paper.
Transmitter: Let ul = ( u0l u1l · · · u
K−1
l
)⊤ and
vl = ( v0l v
1
l · · · v
Nt−1
l
)⊤, be the binary input and
output vectors of the convolutional encoder at time l, re-
spectively, where l ∈ {0, 1, · · · , T − 1}. vl is fed into a
convolutional interleaver in [23] to produce a binary output
vector sl ≡ ( s0l s
1
l · · · s
Nt−1
l
)⊤. For all possible j
and l, vjl = s
j
(l+λj) mod T
, where λi < λj if i < j and
i, j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , Nt− 1}. Fig. 2 shows the interleaver used in
the simulation, where λ is the window size of sliding-window
MAP decoder. Binary vector sl is fed into the BPSK modulator
to produce xl ≡ ( x0l x1l · · · x
Nt−1
l
)⊤, where xjl =
2sjl − 1 for all possible j and l.
Receiver: Let Y = [ y0 y1 · · · yT−1 ]
denote the received signal matrix. Write x¯kl =
Pr(xkl = 1|Y,H)−Pr(x
k
l = −1|Y,H), and
x¯kl = [ x¯
0
l · · · x¯
k−1
l x¯
k+1
l · · · x¯
Nt−1
l
]⊤. Let
xˆkl be the detected version of xkl at the output of MMSE
(minimum mean squared error) detector. Since the decoding
latency of the sliding-window decoder is the window length
λ, the decoder can continuously produce extrinsic value LD,e
after λ symbols. The MMSE detector which performs both
interference nulling and cancelling can continuously use
these extrinsic values to calculate x¯kl and obtain xˆkl after the
decoder can produce output. First we consider the case of
perfect CSI. The decoding-detection algorithm based on the
convolutional interleaver in Fig. 2 is described as follows.
For the first iteration, we will encounter the following cases.
