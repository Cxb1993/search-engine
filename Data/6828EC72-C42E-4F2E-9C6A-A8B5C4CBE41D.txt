Abstract 
Stress development during cofiring a bi-layer ferrite/dielectric laminate has been 
investigated by measuring camber development and shrinkage rate difference. The 
trend of camber development follows a similar pattern to the linear shrinkage rate 
difference between ferrite and dielectric ceramics. No cofiring defects are observed in 
the multilayer structure of ferrite and dielectric laminates, indicating that good 
sintering compatibility between BZN and NiCuZn ferrite exists during cofiring. 
 
Introduction 
To fabricate miniaturized filters or 
electro-magnetic interference devices, 
low-temperature-cofired ceramics (LTCC) 
with mixed dielectric and magnetic 
materials has been identified to be an 
enabling approach. Processing defects 
including de-densification, de-bonding, 
cracks and camber
1-10)
 are always 
observed when different green tapes are 
cofired to fabricate monolithic ceramic 
components. The formation of the above 
defects is mainly attributed to sintering 
incompatibility, and densification rate 
mismatch between different 
materials.
6,7,11,12)
 The sintering 
incompatibility can be solved by adding a 
common sintering flux, 
low-softening-point glass or 
liquid-phase-sintering aid into dielectric 
and magnetic ceramics. By controlling the 
amount of sintering fluxes, particle sizes 
of dielectric and magnetic materials, 
heating rate or packing density of green 
tapes, the level of densification rate 
mismatch could be minimized to reduce 
the magnitude of tensile stress generated 
during cofiring. In this study, a mixed 
LTCC system with dielectric and 
magnetic ceramics is chosen to 
investigate the key factors controlling the 
camber and stress development during the 
cofiring of a bi-layer dielectric/magnetic 
laminate. The dielectric and magnetic 
materials have a composition of 
Bi2(Zn1/3Nb2/3)2O7 (BZN) and 
(Ni0.3Cu0.1Zn0.6O)-(Fe2O3)0.8 (NiCuZn 
ferrite), respectively. Both BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite can be densified at 
875-900℃. Camber development 
during cofiring a bi-layer BZN/NiCuZn 
ferrite laminate is in-situ recorded by 
an optical system. The camber data is 
used to calculate the sintering 
mismatch stress generated during 
cofiring by a viscous model, which is 
also compared with that obtained using 
the linear shrinkage rate difference. 
 
Experimental procedure 
Dielectric and magnetic materials 
used were Bi2(Zn1/3Nb2/3)2O7 (BZN) 
(MRA, MA) and 
(Ni0.3Cu0.1Zn0.6O)-(Fe2O3)0.8, 
respectively. Both ceramic powders had 
a median size of 0.5-1.0 m, and could 
be densified at 875-900℃ for 2 h. The 
densified BZN and NiCuZn ferrite 
exhibited a dielectric constant of 85 and 
initial permeability of 150 at 1MHz. 
Green tapes of dielectric and ferrite 
were prepared using the process 
described previously.
13)
 The green tapes 
were uniform and had a thickness of 
about 50 m. Samples with different 
thicknesses were prepared by 
laminating different numbers of green 
tapes. The lamination condition used in 
this study was 18 MPa at 80℃ for 5 
min. The relative green density of the 
pressed laminates was measured 
dimensionally, and the value was in the 
range of 50%-55% of the theoretical 
density of the fired substrates. The 
laminates were fired at a heating rate of 
2℃/min from room temperature to 
laminate as k=(hBZN+hFerrite)/r where r is 
the radius of curvature.

and (b) interfacial area between BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite, fired at a heating rate of 5
℃/min to 1000℃. 
 
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) summarize the 
data of normalized curvature and its rate 
as a function of temperature, respectively. 
At all temperatures investigated, a 
positive curvature with a maximum at 
890-910℃ is found in Fig. 4(a). Similar 
trend is also observed for the curvature 
rate below 900
o
C in Fig. 4(b). As firing 
continues, the curvature rate becoming 
negative with a maximum at 920-930℃ 
is observed, but reaches negligible at 
temperatures above 1000℃. Figure 5(a) 
shows no cofiring defects formed at the 
interface between BZN and NiCuZn ferrit 
even though a significant camber is 
developed during cofiring. Both BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite layers appear dense (Fig. 
5(b)), indicating that excellent sintering 
compatibility between BZN and NiCuZn 
ferrite exists during cofiring. This can be 
explained by the interdiffusion of Bi from 
BZN diffusing into NiCuZn ferrite and Cu 
from NiCuZn ferrite into BZN. Both of 
them have been demonstrated previously 
to act as a sintering flux to NiCuZn ferrite 
and BZN, respectively.

The sintering mismatch stress 
( AVG ABZN ), which is an average biaxial 
stress in the BZN layer and resulted 
from the linear shrinkage rate mismatch 
in the X-Y directions between BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite, can be calculated by

11, 12, 15)
 
        
                 (1) 
 
where m is the thickness ratio 
(m=hBZN/hferrite) between BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite, n is the viscosity ratio 
between BZN and NiCuZn ferrite (Eq. 
(2)), and ˆBZN  is the nominal viscous 
mismatch stress (Eq. (3)). The viscosity 
ratio (n) between BZN and NiCuZn 
ferrite is described by 
        
                 (2) 
 
where BZNPE and 
ferrite
PE are the 
uniaxial viscosities, and BZNP and 
ferriteP , the viscous Poisson’s ratio of 
porous BZN and NiCuZn ferrite, 
respectively. Figure 6 shows results of 
the uniaxial viscosities of BZN ( BZNPE ) 
and NiCuZn ferrite ( ferritePE ), which 
are determined by cyclic loading 
TMA.

 Both of them exhibit 
similar trend, i.e., decreasing with 
increasing temperature in the range of 
800-825

C due to softening, but 
increasing slightly with increasing 
temperature from 825 to 1000

sintering mismatch stress of symmetric 
BZN/NiCuZn ferrite laminates as a

The above sintering mismatch stress 
is also compared with the sintering 
potentials of BZN and NiCuZn ferrite 
( BZN ), which is the driving force of free 
sintering and related to the porous bulk 
viscosity (KP) and linear strain rate ( ), 
i.e., 3 PK    assuming an isotropic 
shrinkage.
11,12)
 The KP can be calculated 
from the uniaxial viscosity (Ep) and 
Poisson’s ratio (P) by 
KP=EP/(3(1-2P)).
11,12)
 The calculated 
results in Fig. 9 show that at all 
temperatures, the sintering potentials of 
BZN and NiCuZn ferrite are much larger 
than those of sintering mismatch stresses. 
This explains no significant defects, such 
as poor densification, delamination and 
cracks, formed in the multilayer structure 
of symmetric BZN/ferrite during cofiring. 
 
Conclusions 
A bi-layer low-temperature-cofired 
glass dielectric laminate, composed of a 
dielectric material of Bi2(Zn1/3Nb2/3)2O7 
(BZN) and magnetic material of 
(Ni0.3Cu0.1Zn0.6O)-(Fe2O3)0.8 (NiCuZn 
ferrite), has been used to investigate its 
camber and stress development during 
cofiring. Both materials can be densified 
when the bi-layer laminate is cofired. No 
significant defects, such as 
de-densification, de-bonding and cracks, 
are observed in the multilayer structure of 
BZN/NiCuZn ferrite laminates during 
cofiring. The above results are 
attributed to the sintering mismatch 
stress existing between BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite much smaller than those 
of sintering potentials of BZN and 
NiCuZn ferrite. The sintering mismatch 
stress in the BZN layer obtained from 
the camber rate data is in reasonably 
good agreement with those calculated 
using the linear strain rate difference 
obtained from TMA data.
