kinematic system, EMOTE, to control the variation of motion qualities defined by LMA. 
However, the EMOTE is keyframe based and the synthesis of its Effort quality is 
kinematic-based. Therefore, if we want to synthesize a specified quality of a given captured 
example by using EMOTE system, it encounters the problem of finding appropriate 
key-frames. In [11], a dynamics-based motion quality simulator has been proposed. It 
provides links between dynamics parameters and specified motion qualities, that is, it 
provides high-level control intuition of motion dynamics. Based on this simulator, we 
propose a novel motion synthesis scheme which can synthesize a new motion by adapting 
given motion to geometry constraints and specified motion qualities. 
 
2.3 System Framework 
 
The organization of our motion generation framework is shown as in Figure 1. It is 
composed of five components: (1) motion database, (2) geometry constraint generator, (3) 
keyframe generator, (4) interplator, and (5) motion simulator. This section introduces the 
construction and capabilities of respective component.

2.3.1 Motion Database and Index Table 
 
First, we assume that a motion database is a set of continuous stream of 3D motion 
captured by a motion capture device. In other words, it is a sequence of motion frames 
such that each frame can be regarded as a 3D posture. A posture is a vector of joint 
angles which is specified according to an MPEG4-BDP standard (See Figure 2).

where ε  is set to 0.15 in our experiment. 
 
2.3.3 Keyframe Generator 
 
Once we have the required position of end-effectors (feet) by solving the equation 2-5, 
we use Inverse Kinematics solver to compute the desired posture of the keyframes, that 
is, to find proper biped angles according to the specified end-effectors.  
In order to get body balance result after posture transformed, we find the relation 
between root joint and end-effectors by surveying ten walking data in the motion 
database. According to our statistic data (see Figure 3), the ratio between root 
displacement and end-effector displacement is 0.503 which approximately equals to 1/2,

In order to get proper style of the required motion (walk), we investigate the 
end-effector displacement distribution relative to step length which is obtained by 
computing the statistics in the motion database (See Figure 4).

2.3.6 Avoid Feet passing through the Floor 
 
Since we use displacement method to compute the and  over all joints, this 
may result in a posture with the feet passing through the floor. In order to solve this 
problem, we record the position when feet fall on the floor at the keyframe. Then, let 
this position be a geometry constraint and use IK solver to calculate in-betweens. Then, 
the new motion will not cross the floor (See Figure 5, The green character represents the 
modified motion while the blue one shows the original data).

2.4 Experiment and Result 
 
We use the computer with Intel Pentium 4.0G Hz processor, 1G memory and system of 
Microsoft Windows XP as our experiment platform. And the motion data came from CMU 
graphics lab motion capture database. Following figures are some experiment results of this 
study.

constraints. After using dynamics-based motion simulator to learn the produced motions, we 
could obtain motions with various qualities and styles by adjusting dynamics parameters. 
For future work, we will study how to synthesize emotions from motion by investigating 
the relation between emotional qualities and dynamic parameters.

Effort factors into motion quality parameters so that
motion with specified Effort qualities can be synthesized
by varying corresponding kinematic parameters. Since it
is not based on the frequency domain, it works well for
both cyclic and non-cyclic motions. However, the
EMOTE is keyframe based and the synthesis of its
Effort quality is kinematic based. Therefore, if wewant to
synthesize a specified quality of a given captured
example by using EMOTE system, it encounters the
problem of finding appropriate key frames.10 Moreover,
as pointed out in,9,11 the Effort qualities are usually
related to dynamics parameters such as mass, gravity,
and force, which are more intrinsic elements than
kinematic parameters in describing Effort factors.
Motivated by above-mentioned reasons, this paper
proposes a dynamics based and motion capture-driven
Effort simulator so that a given motion can be modified
according to specified Effort qualities. It is motion
capture-driven, therefore it is able to synthesize motion
details and easily to be incorporated into popular
motion capture applications. Besides, it is dynamics
based, it provides high-level control intuition of motion
dynamics in specifying Effort qualities.
Finally, we note that the reasons we focus on the Effort
component are that it is the only LMA component
involving dynamics of a movement and it is regarded as
the basic, irreducible LMA component in delineating an
observed movement.8,9,11
EffortQualities and Simulator
Framework
According to Laban Movement Analysis,8,9 the Effort
component consists of fourmotion factors: Space,Weight,
Time, and Flow. Each motion factor is a continuum
between two opposite motion qualities. These four pairs
of opposite motion qualities are Direct/Indirect on Space,
Strong/Light on Weight, Sudden/Sustained on Time, and
Bound/Free on Flow. These eight motion qualities are
called Effort qualities for short. For more details, please
refer to References [8,9]. Figure 1 depicted the framework
of proposed Effort simulator. In order to facilitate the
control of Effort qualities, the degree of these qualities
are quantified and a scroll-bar is provided for each
factor. In other words, the degree of Effort qualities for
Indirect, Direct, Light, Strong, Sustained, Sudden, Free, and
Bound are quantified by the following variables ind, dir,
lgt, str, sus, sud,fre, and bnd, respectively, with their value
range from 0 to 1.Moreover, two opposite Effort qualities
are mutually exclusive in the sense that if one Effort
quality value is positive, then the value of its opposite
one is zero. After an Effort value being specified, it will
be mapped to the corresponding values of dynamics
parameters. The design detail of our Effort simulator is
presented in the next section.
Effort Simulator
In this section, we will introduce a motion capture-
driven Effort simulator. By modifying the motion
capture-driven simulation given in Reference [12], we
propose an Effort simulator and explore the relations
between Effort qualities and dynamics parameters.
Motion Capture-Driven Controller
The motion simulation proposed by Zordan and
Hodgins12 is a trajectory tracking controller such that
the torque controller for each joint is a proportional
derivative controller (PD-controller) (See Eq. (1)).
tPD ¼ Kðudesired  uactualÞ  Kdð _uactual þ tgÞ (1)
where tPD is the joint torque of PD-controller at each
timestep, K and Kd are the joint stiffness and damping,
udesired is the joint angle of the desired state from each
frame of the motion capture data, uactual and _uactual are
the actual joint angle and angular velocity of the
feedback state at each timestep, tg is the joint torque
against gravity acting on the limb. For each simulation
timestep, the tracking controller computes torque based
on current actual state and the desired state frommotion
capture data. Then the simulation is integrated forward
in time, the state variables are updated, and the process
repeats.
PD-Controller Based Effort- Simulator
and Force-Field Controller
and Proposed Effort-Simulator
Since the tracking controller introduced previously is for
motion simulation, a pure adjustment of the gains in
Equation (1) does not produce variations of Effort
qualities but only influences the fidelity of the
simulation. In order to generate motion variations by
adjusting controller gains, we propose an Effort
simulator by first computing proper gains K and Kd
of Equation (1) so that it faithfully tracks the trajectories
of the givenmotion. With these K and Kd, we define our

where tEffort is the joint torque of Effort-simulator at each
timestep, K and Kd are the proper joint stiffness and
damping precomputed according to Equation (3), Sk is
the scale factor ofK, Sd is the scale factor ofKd, u

FB error is
the feedback error that is online obtained from
(udesired uactual) of Equation (3) during tracking process,
_uactual is the actual joint angular velocity of the feedback
state at each timestep, tg is the joint torque against
gravity acting on the limb, Sg is the scale factor of tg.
We note that as for the balance and constraint
satisfaction of whole body joints, we use the simulation
methods of Zordan andHodgins12 and replace their PD-
controllers by our Effort-simulator.
Dynamics Parameters
and EffortQualities
The proposed Effort-simulator for each joint can be
thought of as a spring and damper system (See Eq. (4)).
The control strategy of this system is online guided by a
sequence of instantaneous trends obtained by tracking
the given example. In addition, the strength of following
the tracking trends is influenced by scaling the gains,
that is, dynamics parameters such as stiffness, damping,
gravity action, rotational inertia, and external force. In
order to facilitate our study, we invited a Certified
Movement Analyst (CMA) as our consultant to deter-
mine what appearance of an Effort quality is influenced
by the specific dynamics parameters. Moreover, the
CMA can help us to identify the dynamics parameters
which influence the specified Effort quality.
IndirectQuality and External Force
The Indirect quality of the Space factor manifests
meandering, wandering, and multi-focus.8,9 With a
given reference motion, our basic idea to synthesize its
Indirect quality is to deviate or perturb the end-effector
trajectory of the given motion by randomly providing
extra external force. Then according to the method,12 the
effect of external force, that is, the deviation value can be
realized by adding an offset angle ul to the original
control feedback uFB error. Therefore, a random deviation
of the original end-effector leads to the wandering
movement and multi-focus.
Direct Quality and External Force
The Direct quality of the Space factor manifests focused,
channeled, undeviating, and pinpointing.8,9 Our strategy
for synthesizing Direct quality is to consolidate the
directional variations of the end-effector movement by a
computed alignment force toward a given pivoting
direction. Intuitively, a higher dir value implies that
more directions are aligned to the pivoting direction.
This implies more focused movement.
Light Quality and Stiffness
and Anti-Gravity
The Light quality of theWeight factor manifests buoyant,
delicate, and lesser pull of gravity.8,9 It is trivial that
dropping the stiffness parameter K in Equation (4)
makes a lower joint torque, so that the simulated motion
become more pliable.12 Hence, dropping the scale factor
Sk in Equation (4) results in decreasing pressure and
delicate movement. To establish the correspondence
between lgt and the feasible range of scale factor Sk, if
lgt¼ 0, that is, no Light adjustment is required, then it is
trivial Sk¼ 1. For lgt¼ 1, we have to find a lower bound
m for Sk which corresponds to the lightest quality. That
is, there is no significant improvement for lightness
when Sk<m. This can be done by binary search with
startingm1¼ 1/2,m2¼ (1/2)2,. . ., untilmN¼ (1/2)N such
that there is no significant difference in lightness
between mN and mNþ 1. Then, we choose m ¼mN. After
determining m, the linear relation between lgt and Sk
with boundary conditions, lgt¼ 0, Sk¼ 1, and lgt¼ 1,
Sk¼m can be derived as
Sk ¼ 1 ð1mÞlgt; lgt 2 0; 1 (5)
In addition to stiffness, increasing the anti-gravity
scale Sg in Equation (4) strengthens the joint torque
against gravity, so that it looks less pull of gravity.
According to our experiments, it is sufficient to see the
influence of the anti-gravity action when the maximal
value of Sg is set to two. Therefore, the linear relation
between lgt and Sg with boundary conditions, lgt¼ 0,
Sg¼ 1 and lgt¼ 1, Sk¼ 2 can be derived as
Sg ¼ 1þ lgt; lgt 2 ½0; 1 (6)

number r 2 ½0; 1 and then comparing r to P(fre) at each
timestep. If rP(fre), then we choose the negative
damping scale with given fre by Equation (11), that is,
scale factor Sd< 0. Otherwise, we set scale factor Sd¼ 1.
Although P(fre) triggers the vibration to be spreading
out by growing the energy locally at each timestep, the
degree of Free quality will bemanifested eventually after
accomplishing the global simulated process. In other
words, to increase the degree of Free quality, we can
increase the probability of growing the vibration energy
(having negative damping steps), that is, spreading out
behavior, during the modification process. That is, a
higher value of Free, fre, is associated with more steps of
having negative damping.

(11)
BoundQuality and Damping
and Anti-Gravity
The Bound quality of the Flow factor means that one’s
movement is controlled, restrained, and withheld.8,9 A
high positive damping parameter easily makes the
energy decay so that the strength of following the
tracking trends is restrained due to the insufficient
energy. Hence, this restrainedmovement can be thought
of as a Bound movement. The correspondence between
bnd and scale factor Sd can be found by first
corresponding bnd¼ 0 to Sd¼ 1. Then, similar to the
Strong case, the upper bound D of Sd can be found as
follows. Initially, we choose a large damping, say
Sd¼ 10. It usually results in no sufficient energy to
activate the motion. Then, we decrease the upper bound
according to the binary search strategy until a feasible
one is found. After determining D, the linear relation
between bnd and Sd with boundary conditions, bnd¼ 0,
Sd¼ 1 and bnd¼ 1, Sd¼D can be derived as
Sd ¼ 1þ ðD  1Þ bnd; bnd 2 0; 1 (12)
In addition, if the anti-gravity scale Sg in Equation (4)
drops below 1, then the joint torque against gravity
acting on the limbwill be decreased. Hence, the limb has
less torque to overcome gravity and it looks more
gravity-bound. In our experiments, it is sufficient to see
the influence of the gravity-bound action when the
minimal feasible Sg is equal to 1. Therefore, the linear
relation between bnd and Sg with boundary conditions,
bnd¼ 0, Sg¼ 1 and bnd¼ 1, Sg¼1 can be derived as
Sg ¼ 1 2  bnd; lgt 2 ½0; 1 (13)
Experimental Results
and Discussions
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, several
examples have been implemented. These animations
demonstrate the simulated qualitative variations of
Effort factors, namely, Space, Weight, Flow, and Time
(Please refer to the submitted AVI files). In each
animation, the neutral (reference) motion example is
simulated by the FF-controller of Equation (3) and the
onewith Effort quality is simulated by Effort-simulator of
Equation (4). Each animation consists of three parts. The
first part shows the difference between the neutral
motion and that with specified Effort quality. The second
part shows the difference between the neutral motion
and that with opposite Effort quality. The third part
emphasizes the difference between two simulated
opposite Effort qualities. To justify our synthesized
results, first, the quality of synthesized motion is
certified by our CMA consultant to make sure the
synthesized quality is acceptable. Moreover, we use
features proposed by Zhao and Badler10,15 to distinguish
the synthesized motions (See Figures 2–4). According to
their studies, the strong correlations between Effort
qualities have following features. Space and Weight
correlate to path curvatures and corner curvatures,
where path curvatures are the curvatures that are not in
the proximities of the direction-changing locations and
corner curvatures are the curvatures at the the direction-
changing locations. Flow correlates to the percentage of
accelerations and decelerations, (PAD). Moreover,
according to our observation, Time appears to correlate
to the derivative of acceleration. Furthermore, to
provide a comparison base, we ask a trained actor to
perform each example with specified qualities and we
captured these motions as our ground truth data, called
performed data for short.
The animation shown in (Space) video illustrates that
both hands do appear straight forward or wandering by
applying the Direct and Indirect qualities, respectively.
However, our proposed method for simulating the
Direct quality has the following limitation. If a given
example has many sharp turns which are outside the
alignment range, the simulated result will become
piecewise Directmovements. If we examine the features

because the adjustment of rotational inertia is essential
but not enough to produce the believable Sudden and
Sustained appearances. Considering the Sudden appear-
ance, dropping the rotational inertia parameters on the
arm limbs just made the arms swing faster but the CMA
consultant did not accept this simulated result as a
Sudden appearance. She suggested us that if the
simulation has a short period of sudden stop while
the arm swings to the top or bottom, it appears the
Sudden quality. According to this suggestion, first, we
drop the rotational inertia parameters on the arm limbs
to make the simulation swing faster. Then, using this
simulated result as the guiding example, we tune the
damping parameters of each arm joint to make a Sudden
stop appearance when the hand almost approaches the
end position. On the other hand, raising the rotational
inertia parameters on the arm limbs will slow down the
armsmovement. The slowness only catches one factor of
the Sustained appearance. It was suggested that if we can
extend the arm swinging space, the Sustained qualitywill
become more apparent. According to this comment,
first, we raise the stiffness parameters on the arm joints
to loosen the arm swinging space. This loosening
process will result in Strong quality. To remedy this
side-effect, we raise the rotational inertia parameters on
the arm limbs to slowdown themotion. Although there is
no explicit Time feature discussed in References [10,15],
by examining the performed data, we find it correlates to
the derivative of acceleration. Figure 4 manifests that
acceleration derivatives in both performed and simu-
lated motions examples of Sudden are eminently higher
than those ofNeutral and Sustainedmotions. Besides, the
curves of acceleration derivatives of Sustainedmotion are
flatter (See Figure 4).
Conclusion and FutureWork
This study introduces a new computational model to
simulate the variation of Effort qualities based on a given
motion capture data. Based on the Effort simulator, the
specified values of Effort qualities can be converted into
the corresponding dynamics parameters according to
Equations (5)–(13). In addition, the Effort simulator

tracks the given example and tune the dynamics
parameters according to specified Effort qualities to
synthesize the desired motion. However, by no means
the synthesized motion is perfect or unique to the
specified qualities. We believe that the human potential
is enormous so that every performer has his own
interpretation and performance to the same Effort
qualities with a given motion. Therefore, we have to
admit that each dynamics parameter in our proposed
method only simulates the appearance subset of the
corresponding Effort quality. To simulate the volatile
appearance of the specific Effort quality, many other
research fields such as psychology, biomechanics, and
dance dynamics should be involved. Besides, the
mapping between a given value of Effort quality and
the corresponding dynamics parameters also deserves
further investigation. Finally, we note, in this work, the
‘keypoints’ concept in EMOTE is not considered. That is,
a user is not allowed to specify the end-effector position
constraints in our system. For future work, the notion of
‘keypoints’ will be studied by considering an external
force to drag the end-effector to the specified position.
