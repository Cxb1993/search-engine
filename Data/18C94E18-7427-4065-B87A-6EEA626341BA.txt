(二) 英文摘要
This proposal for a two-year project aims at the development of a new LC-tuned
quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) to provide differential IQ signals for
the Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) direct conversion transceivers applications. In the first
year, we have implemented a cascade-coupled CMOS QVCO. The VCO for
multi-band or wide tuning range applications will be demonstrated by using our
proposed switchable inductor. Based on a new frequency plan, we have proposed a
new RF synthesizer architecture for UWB MB-OFDM system. A quadrature VCO
that can operate at 6,072 / 6,600 MHz by using the switchable inductor is designed
for such synthesizer. Finally, the QVCO integrated with our proposed switchable
inductor has been fabricated in TSMC 0.18 μm 1P6M standard CMOS technology.
We published the measurement results in IEEE 2007 International Microwave
Symposium.
In this year (the 2nd year), we continue the study of the two key function
blocks –the VCO and the Mixer for the frequency synthesizer. We mainly focus on
load in our mixer design. In order to degrade the power consumption effectively,
LC-tank structure is implemented instead of resistor. Due to UWB MB-OFDM
system covers relative large frequency ranges, the mixer must be designed to be able
to operate at 3.1 to 10.6 GHz frequency range. For unity inductance, the peak
impedance appears at 6.5 GHz which could degrade the output impedance
dramatically at high/low frequency bands. From above reasons, we use switchable
inductors to realize wideband load. We combine a MOSFET transistor with the
differential inductor as switch, which its peak impedance is 5 GHz and 8 GHz
receptively. It is effective to improve the output impedance at high/low frequency
bands. Due to the difficulty of getting a quadrature signal source when doing the
measurement, therefore another important point of this design is the integration of
oscillators and mixer. By using the signal generated by oscillators apply to the mixer,
we prove the operation features of the mixer at 10 GHz for our design. To verify this
proposed mixer can operate at 10 GHz. The two oscillators operate at 3,168/4,224
and 6,072/7,128 MHz for the UWB system application together with the mixer to
up-convert the frequency to 10.296 GHz.

For a sinusoidal input signal, if the device exhibits nonlinear behaviors, the output
would normally include signals at integer multiples of the frequencies of input signal.
Equation (2-2), the term with the input frequency is called the “fundamental”, and the
higher order terms are called the “harmonics”, such as 2, 3. These harmonics
would cause performance degradations. Generally speaking, the harmonics amplitude is
lower than the fundamental. The linearity performance degenerate when the input power
level increasing. Thus the issue that is the harmonics degradation could be discussed
worthily.
b. Inter-modulation [10][33]
When input ports of a nonlinearity system are driven by two different frequencies,
the output port generates the multi-sinusoid signals that are not harmonics of the input
frequencies. These signals are called “inter-modulation (IM)”, which is mixed by two
signals. Assuming that two signals are 1 1cos( )A t and 2 2cos( )A t . According to (2-1),
the nonlinear output can be approximated as

Two third-order inter-modulation (IM3) products are generated at 1 22  and
1 22  where there are the most dominant nonlinearity components. Thus these affect
seriously the linearity in the receiver system [12].

Note that IIP3 measures the small-signal nonlinearity dominated by the third-order
nonlinearity, and that 1dBP measures the large-signal nonlinearity from all odd-order
nonlinearities [15].
b. Port-to-Port Isolation
The isolation between LO and RF ports is critical. The most important is the
LO-to-RF feedthrough, which results in LO signal to leak the LNA and eventually the
antenna and becomes an interferer to corrupt other receivers. LO-to-IF isolations are
also important but LO signals can be rejected by low-pass filter at the IF output. Finally,
the RF-IF isolation determines what fraction of the signal in the RF path directly
appears in the IF, a critical issue in respect of the even-order distortion problem in
direct-conversion receivers [10]. However, large LO and RF feedthrough signals at the
IF output port can saturate the IF output port, and decrease the P-1dB of the mixer [13].
c. Conversion Gain
A mixer should provide sufficient power gain to compensate for the IF filter loss,
and to reduce the noise contribution from IF stages. However, this gain should not be
too large as a strong signal may saturate the output of the mixer [10][13]. The
conversion gain is defined as the ratio of the desired output signals to the input signals.
In general, the conversion gain function can be expressed as a power ratio, a rms
voltage ratio, or a current ratio. In (2-14), power conversion gain is related to voltage or
current gain by

where oV and iV are output and input voltages, respectively; oI and iI are output
and input currents, respectively; LR and SR are load and source resistance,
respectively.
d. Noise Figure
In a direct-conversion receiver, 1 f noise degrades the signal-to-signal ratio
(SNR) and total noise figure (NF), which results in the degradation of receiver
sensitivity. In narrowband RF systems, bandwidth utilization is a critical issue and it can
be maximized by using a reduced 1 f noise receiver system because we can utilize
more channels around the dc area. In a multi-carrier modulation system like orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), spectral efficiency can also be improved by
using a reduced 1 f noise receiver system. CMOS transistors suffer from high
intrinsic 1 f noise, which is inversely proportional to the device area. Therefore,
minimum length of the device increases 1 f noise [31]. The noise factor (F) of a
system which results in the degradation of receiver sensitivity is defined as the ratio of
signal-to-noise ratios available at input and output as

Figure 2.7 DSB noise figure
Compare Fig. 2.6 with Fig. 2.7, there are obvious that the mixer in the heterodyne
architecture has twice as many noise contributors as that in the homodyne architecture.
The SSB noise power is about 2 times (3dB) higher than the DSB noise power [13].
D. Mixer Architectures
By using passive mixer and active mixer is to implement the mixer architecture.
a. Passive Mixer
Figure 2.8 Mixer diagram
Mixer which can convert frequency is important device in the receiver architecture.
Actually, it’s multiplication circuit. In Fig. 2.8, assuming that RF signal and LO signal
are driven by sin RFRF t and sin LOLO t in input ports of mixer, then output signal
of mixer can be expressed as
( )( )
( sin )( sin ) [cos( ) cos( ) ]
2RF LO RF LO RF LO
RF LO
RF t LO t t t         (2-18)
Taking a looking at the above equation, output signals of mixer have two frequencies
which are down-conversion and up-conversion, respectively. We extract the desirable
frequency in our system and use the filter to cancel the other. We have two ways to
implement the passive mixer as the following description.
(1)
NSC95-2221-E-006-083-
From (2-22), in contrasts with (2-19), this architecture can avoid to generate even order
harmonic of LO signal. Output signals are compose of RF feedthrough, down-
conversion signal, even order inter-modulation. In Fig. 2.11, nMOS works in the linear
region and its gate are driven by LO signal while the drain is applied RF signal. This
type has low voltage gain because its voltage gain is only 1.
Because of devices operation in the linear region, the passive mixer has high
linearity and excellent IIP3. Nevertheless, this circuit has higher conversion gain loss
and these loss of the circuit contribute more noise to the system which needs addition
preamplifier gain to compensate these loss, thus the passive mixer needs larger
amplitude of local oscillator. But the large local oscillator signal will easily leak to RF
port and IF port. Because the passive switched circuit performs poor LO-to-RF and
LO-to-IF isolation [19][20][27][28].
b. Active Mixer
The active mixer usually provides higher conversion gain which is decided by the
product of the input transconductance mg and load impedance, and it can suppress the
noise contributed by the subsequent stages, so noise figure in active mixer is smaller
than in passive mixer. But the higher gain can degrade the linearity. In the consideration
of the design mixer, the trade-off is an important between gain and linearity. The active
mixer performs better LO-to-RF and LO-to-IF isolation, but it has the disadvantages of
higher power consumption and poor linearity [18].

Figure 2.12 Single-balanced mixer
In Fig. 2.12 shows single-balance mixer, which accommodates a differential LO
signal but a single-ended RF signal, the mixer usually cascades three stages
(transconductance stage, commutating stage and load stage). All nMOS operate in the
saturation region, as a transconductance (M1) convert RF signal which be driven by
voltage signal to current, then commutated by LO signal and down-converted to IF band
by the load stage. However, single-balance mixer still can not avoid generating LO
feedthrough.
2. Double-balance Mixer
In Fig. 2.13, it shows double-balance mixer that is designed based on a Gilbert cell
topology [26], which operates with both differential LO and RF inputs. A major
problem of using the Gilbert cell topology in low power circuits is the relative required

In conclusion, the IP3 of the Gilbert cell is proportional with the squared root of
the bias current and inversely proportional with the squared root of the transconductance
parameter of the input pair M1, M2. For a better linearity performance, we should either
increase the bias current of decrease the transistor size. This comes in contradiction with
the low power consumption requirement (low bias current) and the low noise figure
design condition (which requires a wide input transistor) [23].

Figure 2.14 Switch input voltage [24]
From (2-38), it is worth noticing that low-frequency noise at the gate of switch Vn
appears at the output directly, and the output 1 f noise current is decreased if the
product of the slope of the LO signal at zero-crossing and its period. According to
(2-39), Vn is inversely proportional to the device area. In order to decrease 1 f noise
in the direct mechanism, a popular method is to reduce the width of the noise pulses,
which can be implemented by reducing the value of Vn. To reduce the value of Vn, the
size of the switching pairs needs to be increased, but large switching devices increase
the parasitic capacitance of the switching pairs, resulting in the 1 f noise indirectly
translating to the output. Due to the time interval near zero-crossing of the switching
pair, the nMOS (M3~M6) of the time-variant stage will conduct, and there will have a
noise current path to direct to the IF output. So a significant noise current can exist at
the IF frequency during this time interval. So sufficient LO drive must be supplied to
make the differential pair approximate ideal.
Another one is indirect mechanism, 1 f noise mainly depends on the tail capacitance
of the node between the LO switches and RF transconductance stage. When a sine-wave
LO is applied to the mixer, the average of the output noise current is generated by the
indirect mechanism is

where Cp is the tail capacitance of the node between the LO switches and the RF
transconductance stage, T is the LO period, gms is the transconductance of the LO
switches, and Vn is the equivalent 1 f noise of the switching pair. According to (2-40),
the tail capacitance should be small enough to decrease the effect of indirect mechanism
[24][25][31][32].

Figure 3.2 Frequency tree diagram
In Fig. 3.3 shows the synthesizer architecture presented in [44] for the generation
of seven frequencies (between 3,432-7,920 MHz) base on a PLL that generates a tone at
6,336 MHz. However, this architecture requires the more area and power due to the high
frequency and wide-band nature of the components involved. Thus in Fig. 3.4 shows
that a significant reduction in power and area would be expected due to the reduced
number of mixers with multiple frequency output. Choosing the VCO frequency as
6,336 MHz and following the path enclosed by the dotted lines (Fig. 3.2).

Figure 3.5 Our proposed synthesizer architecture for MB-OFDM UWB system
In our proposed synthesizer architecture, two QVCO’s that operate at 3,168 and
7,128 MHz respectively must be used for our frequency plan in order to cover 3.16-10.6
GHz MB-OFDM radio. The 3,168 MHz QVCO generates the auxiliary frequencies
through a divide-by-two and a divide-by-three. The five reference tones, such as 3,960,
5,544, 7,128, 8,712, and 10,296 MHz, are generated by proper controlling the path
switch and the multiplexer behavior. The function of the path switch is to adjust the
quadrature signal’s order of the auxiliary frequency. From above architectures we know
that SSB mixer is an important role in the synthesizer architecture, and it must be able
to mix the majority of MB-OFDM UWB bands. This work, the quadrature mixer that
operates at 3.1 to 10.6GHz is necessary for wideband load. Therefore, this thesis mainly
focuses on how to design a quadrature mixer for our proposed synthesizer architecture.
We design the architecture and device parameters of the circuit as following section.
The simulation software SpectreRF is used to simulate the circuit whether the function
works. If the simulation is successful, we draw the layout by Virtuoso and verify it by
DRC and LVS. Then, it is extracted the parasitic capacitances form the layout by LPE.
Finally, we put those parasitic capacitors into the original circuit and simulate again to
ensure simulation results achieving our prediction. If the simulation results are not
content with the specification, we must modify the device parameters or the layout until
success.
1. Quadrature Mixer Structure
In this design, a wideband quadrature mixer is required for MB-OFDM UWB
system in our proposed synthesizer architecture. In Fig. 3.6 shows the quadrature mixer
that consists of the core circuit and load stage. In load stage, we adopt the LC-tank
because it can lower dc power consumption. The switch path circuit mainly arranges the
quadrature signals to choose up or down-conversion as shown the Table 3.2.

2. Switchable Differential Inductor
Assuming that the LC-tank only peaks at the middle of the total bands, and it is not
enough the output impedance at the low/high frequency band to cause the weak output
swing. Thus the switchable inductor is used to solve the question about the shortage of
output impedance and implement wideband loads. The equivalent inductance can be
change by switching the MOS ON/OFF to meet the requirement of switch frequency.
Utilizing the variation of the inductance lets LC-tank peak at 5,016 and 8,184 MHz as

inductor passes through the conductive substrate, the magnetic field will
change rapidly. According to Faraday-Lenz law, the substrate will induce
currents which flow in the opposite direction than the current carried by the
inductor simultaneously in order to resist the variation of magnetic field,
resulting in a reduction of the magnitude of the total magnetic field and
increasing of power consumption. This effect will reduce the inductance and
Q.

4. Buffer Stage
Because the load is easy to influence core circuit, we insert the buffer between
mixer and load to isolate each other, thus the variation of load will not interfere directly.
In Fig. 3.19, the architecture of buffer adopts source-follower. Its primary advantages
are near unity for gain, higher input impedance and lower output impedance. The load
in RF system is usually about 50 ohms. Assuming that the output impedance of buffer is
low, the intensity of output signal transmits to load strongly. We also choose suitable
transistors size and bias voltage V4 to ensure two transistors operating in saturation
region.

B. Design theIntegration of VCO’s and Mixer for UWB Frequency Synthesizer
From above design, quadrature mixer is applied for MB-OFDM UWB between
3-10 GHz. Because the quadrature signals source with high frequency are obtain hardly,
thus this work mainly focus on designing the integration of VCO and mixer for UWB
frequency synthesizer. The part of VCO connects to power supply and immediately
oscillate the signals that provide for the input of mixer. However, the output of mixer
only connects to the instrument to measure the output signals whether it can operate at
10.3 GHz successfully (Fig. 3.38). At present, some papers propose the integration of
mixer and VCO in order to decreasing power consumption and area. But the purpose of
our proposal only is to test and verify whether the mixer operates the highest frequency
of MB-OFDM UWB bands for UWB frequency synthesizer application. Therefore, we
choose the frequency at 3,168/4,224 MHz and 6,072/7,128 MHz for MB-OFDM UWB
bands application, and those signals can be up-converted to 10,296 MHz. In order to
generate four frequencies, we design two VCO’s to implement those frequencies,
NSC95-2221-E-006-083-
which cause distortion at output stage. However, it is very important to acquire the local
oscillator with better phase noise in the mixer.
1. Core Circuit of VCO’s
Due to their relatively good phase noise, ease of implementation, and differential
operation, cross-coupled inductance-capacitance (LC) oscillators play an important role
in high-frequency circuit design [8][36][37]. Design and optimization of integrated LC
oscillator pose many challenges to circuit designers as simultaneous optimization of
multiple variables is required. However, an optimal design requires the simultaneous
consideration of both active and passive devices, such as inductor, transistors, varactor,
and bias current.
In Fig. 3.40 shows that the VCO structure consists of pMOS cross-coupled pair,
LC-tank, tail current source, and switched capacitors array. The all-pMOS VCO circuit
also offers several advantages from a topology standpoint. It provides excellent isolation
from power supply noise through the use of a pMOS current source to VDD, and a
ground-referenced tank.
The part of the inductor adopts TSMC differential inductor with center-tapped. To
achieve the lower phase noise performance, integrated passive LC-VCO’s tend to be the
best choice. The design of a passive LC-VCO relies on the integration of a high quality
LC-tank. The 21 f region of phase noise spectrum is mainly up-converted white noise
generated by the tank’s parasitic resistance. We find the optimum Q value by ADS tool
because the better Q value is easy to oscillate and to lower phase noise generation.
There are several varactor options for frequency tuning such as junction diodes,
MOS capacitors and accumulation mode capacitors. In this work, we adopt the MOS
varactors, Cvar, are used for fine tuning to compensate for process variations and
modeling inaccuracies. The varactor tunability is defined by the ratio of the maximum
varactor capacitance over the minimum varactor capacitance. A 2-pF on-chip bypass
capacitor Cg is placed at the VCO core virtual ground node to suppress the noise around
2 o and higher. This work operates at 1.8V Vdd and 3mA current, if supply voltage
and core current is reduced, which limits the VCO tank voltage swing and can cause
phase noise degradation.
The capacitors C1, C2, and C3 in the switched capacitors are inter-digital metal-
insulator-metal capacitors. These switched capacitors tune VCO to 3,168 MHz and
6,072 MHz. Three control voltage v_sw1, v_sw2, and v_df are used to switch the
frequency and satisfy the corner conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 3.41, when M5 is OFF,
the parasitic capacitances Cdb and Cgd of transistor are series with C1. Here Cdb is the
drain-to-substrate capacitor and Cgb is the drain-to-gate capacitor. The transistor
drain-to-substrate resistor Rsub is in series with Cdb and degrades the switched capacitor
Q, to minimize the loss through Rsub. In order to increase tunability, Cdb and Cgd should
be made smaller thus it is preferable to make M5 narrower, but which causes a larger
Ron to increase the tank loss [45].
NSC95-2221-E-006-083-
width should be minimized to lower the up-conversion factor for low frequency bias
noise and switching transistor 1 f noise [50]. But reducing switching transistor device
width can cause mg drop, the pMOS cross-coupled pair provides a negative resistance
that maybe becomes insufficient for compensation for parasitic resistor power loss. The
oscillator will not oscillate. Therefore, we must choose carefully the proper devices size
to complete the oscillator.
Analyze the tail current source (M1 and M2)
Adding the tail current source is to decrease sensitivity to power supply noise and
variation of the bias current over process and temperature. But the tail current can
contribute noise to phase noise. In Fig. 3.42 show the phase noise plot that represents
the oscillator using tail current source and the other without using it under operation
same consumption current. The phase noise offset 1 MHz is -118 dBc/Hz by using tail
current source and the other is -125 dBc/Hz without using it.
Figure 3.42 The relationship between phase noise with tail current source
The 1 f noise from the tail current source that enters the LC-tank will be up-
converted due to the mixing action of the VCO circuit. When the circuit of Fig. 3.43 is
balanced, the common-node of the current source will oscillate at twice the oscillator
center frequency, 2 o , because the current source will be pulled every time one of the
pMOS transistors switches on. Through channel length modulation, the noise of the tail
current source is up-converted to 2 o . The up-converted noise enters the LC-tank and
is mixed with the fundamental oscillator frequency, resulting in phase noise sidebands at
the oscillator frequency. Therefore, to minimize the up-conversion of 1 f noise from
the tail current source, all even harmonics must be suppressed, meaning that the circuit
must be as symmetric as possible. The 1 f noise from the tail current source will be
the main contributor to 31 f region of phase noise. When transistors are ideally
switched, the 1 f noise can be removed. When the switching is not ideal, a small
NSC95-2221-E-006-083-
(2) When Ibias= 3mA, in Fig. 3.45 shows that the variation of channel length of current
mirror affects the phase noise performance. The phase noise performance is
improved by increasing the channel length. Thus, we choose L=0.5um.

5. The Relationship between Ibias and VCO Performance
Table 3.17 and Table 3.18 show that the variation of core current effects power
spectrum and phase noise performance respectively. The output voltage swing, output
power and phase noise are improved by increasing core current. But this way also
increases the power consumption.

IV. Measurement Results: the Quadrature Mixer Using Switchable
Inductive Loads for UWB Frequency Synthesizer
a. Measurement Considerations
The measurement for this quadrature mixer will be tested on PCB board. Due to
quadrature signal source is hard to obtain, thus we mainly adopt 6.6 GHz quadrature
voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) from previously tape out as signal source. This
QVCO with switchable inductor can switch frequency band, so using two QVCO’s
which resonate at different frequency band drives into quadrature mixer to verify its
function. In PCB board layout, we considerate the symmetric layout to expect the lower
affection of PCB board. This measurement is executed by Agilent Network Analyzer
(E4440A and E5052A) for output spectrum test. Due to the integrated of this circuit and
new synthesizer architecture later, thus we verify the power and purity of output
spectrum and record the comparison between fundamental and harmonics.
NSC95-2221-E-006-083-
the function of frequency mixing. For our proposed design, two VCO’s provide several
frequency combinations for 10 GHz, therefore to verify VCO’s operate at correct
oscillation frequency, and the measurement issues must be concerned. We divide the
measurement into normal-operation and test-operation, in Fig5.2. In the test-operation
mode, as long as we take the output of VCO’s to put on the instrument, then, we verify
the function of frequency mixing. In normal-operation mode, the spectrum of mixed
signals at output stage could be calibrated. We arrange the circuit on PCB board
symmetrically and expect the effects of PCB board can be alleviated. This measurement
is executed by Agilent Network Analyzer (E4440A and E5052A) for output spectrum
test. Examine the purity and power of mixed output spectrum, also for its high order
mixed modes. We record the measurement results for out own references of frequency
synthesizer design.
This chip bond wire to PCB test board, therefore, we must realize the equivalent
circuit of bond-wire and pad. Bond-wire is to seem the inductor with high Q. According
to CIC notice, the inductor of bond-wire about 0.8nH/mm and series resistor about
0.32Ω/mm as shown follow Fig. 5.3. This work, we expect the length of bond-wire
about 2-2.5mm. The equivalent circuit of pad consists of resistor and capacitor that
represents two layers for M5 and M6 in the 80*80um2 area.

dBc/Hz
The reason for fail:
When Ibias current lower than 8mA, VCO#1 will not produce the resonance signal
at 3,168 MHz. Because we use the switching capacitors that generate parasitic resistors
when the switch is on to switch band to 3,168 MHz, the pMOS cross-coupled pair is
unable to provide a sufficient negative resistance to compensate parasitic resistor power
loss. Thus, VCO#1 can produce the resonance signal at 3,168 MHz successfully when
we adjust the off-chip resistor to improve Ibias current about 8.67mA. The phase noise
offset 100kHz is -75 dBc/Hz and offset 1 MHz is -124 dBc/Hz with Ibias = 8.67mA.

Abstract — This work presents a new frequency plan and a
reconfigurable 6.6 / 7.128 GHz CMOS quadrature voltage-
controlled oscillator (QVCO) with integrating differential
switchable inductors. Based on this frequency plan, a further
simple synthesizer architecture is proposed with only two PLL’s,
two mixers, and one multiplexer. The QVCO is implemented with
the mutual-coupling structure of two differential LC-tuned
oscillator cores in a 0.18μm RF CMOS technology. The core
stages draw a total of 10 mA from the supply voltage of 2.0 V. The
measured phase noise at 6.6 GHz is -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.
By utilizing a switched capacitance array, a tuning range of 860
MHz is achievable with four sub-bands. The figure of merits
(FOM) is about -178 dB. According to the new frequency plan,
this QVCO can be served as one of the original signal sources for
the MB-OFDM UWB frequency synthesizer.
Index Terms — Frequency synthesizer, quadrature oscillator,

I. INTRODUCTION
The UWB technology features the advantages of short-
range, high-data-rate, and high-security communication. The
unlicensed band of 3.1-10.6 GHz is divided into fourteen sub-
bands, each with a spacing of 528 MHz, for the multi-band
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM)
system [1]. These sub-bands are grouped into five groups as
illustrated in Fig. 1. Only the first group is considered for the
mandatory mode-1 operation when applying the UWB
technology. However, for transmission of huge quantities of
data, other optional sub-bands have to be involved in the
system.
At present, several frequency synthesizers have been
reported to generate the variable carrier frequencies desired
for the mode-2 operation [2]-[3]. However, the generated
frequencies are fallen in the 3-8 GHz band, involving the
mode-1 band and only part of the mode-2 band. Through the
frequency plans, the possible architectures of frequency
synthesizers have been proposed [4] for providing the carrier
frequencies of the entire 3.1-10.6 GHz band. Based on the
macro-model simulations, the impact of synthesizer spurs on
the bit-error-rate (BER) was investigated in [4]. It was
concluded that the different frequency plans lead to the
different numbers of frequency dividers, single-sideband
(SSB) mixers, and filters used in the synthesizer. Increasing
the numbers of SSB mixers generally degrades the spurious
performance because of the non-linear operation of the mixers.
A careful arrangement of the filtering blocks is necessary to
suppress the spurs, thus increasing the complexity of the
frequency synthesizer. Reducing the numbers of the mixers
becomes an important issue in UWB frequency synthesizer
design.

The realization of a full-band frequency synthesizer has
been presented in [5]. By using two phase-lock loops (PLL’s),
three SSB mixers and two multiplexers, the synthesizer can
provide 14-band carrier frequencies. By adopting two locked
frequencies at 3,960MHz and 6,336MHz, the numbers of
mixers can be reduced as compared with that reported in [4].
Another design issue existing in [4] and [5] is the generation
of fundamental frequency of 528MHz. Unless a 2N-times
multiplication of 528MHz (that is, 2N × 528 MHz, where N
denotes an integer) is utilized as the original signal source, a
divide-by-three frequency divider is usually adopted to obtain
the fundamental frequency of 528MHz. The circuitry of a
divider-by-three is inherently more complicated than that of a
divide-by-two. The design difficulty is on the generation of
symmetric quadrature output with a 50% duty-cycle
waveform [6]. Therefore, the circuitry complexity can be
further reduced by omitting the use of divide-by-three.
This work proposes a new frequency plan with the design
advantages of previous plans in [4] and [5] but which only
needs two SSB mixers. Therefore, a divided-by-three
frequency divider is not necessary. One of the challenges of
the proposed architecture is to generate switchable source
frequencies at 6.6GHz and 7.128GHz. Another challenge is

C. Differential Switchable Inductor Design
Switched inductors are adopted for the proposed QVCO to
obtain the desired frequency of 6.6GHz or 7.128GHz.
However, to achieve the smaller area consumption, the
switched inductors are in a differential layout rather than in the
layout like in [7]. The inductor structure is simulated and
modeled through the co-simulation of circuit simulator ADS
and electromagnetic simulator Momentum. The size of the
switch MOS is set to W/L = 1,920μm / 0.18 μm after the Q-
factor optimization. The simulated Q-factors are about 8.6 at
6.6GHz regardless of whether the switch is turned on or turned
off. A proper simulation design leads to the frequency jump
between the on and off states of the MOS switch of about
528MHz under a fixed tuning bias, say, 0.9V. The total tuning
range should cover 6,600 MHz and 7,128 MHz to guarantee
the operation function of the synthesizer.
III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
Figure 4 shows a photograph of the QVCO chip. The total
chip size, including the bonding pads, was 1.184 × 0.903 mm2.
The chip was wire-bonded to a TSSOP-16 package. The
packaged IC was mounted to a RO4003 PCB for the
measurement. The performances were measured with a signal
source analyzer, Agilent E5052A. A quadrature buffer stage
was also integrated into the chip to drive the low impedance
of the measurement instrument.

The oscillator cores totally drew a current of about 10mA
from the supply voltage of 2.0V. The power consumption was
20 mW. The buffer stage drew a total current of about 13mA
in order to drive the 50Ω load. Although the coarse tuning of
resonant frequency involves three control bits (SWL, SWC1,
SWC2), only four settings were considered. The default
setting of the control bits for the four sub-bands are listed in
Table II. By fine-tuning the varactor from 0.5V to 1.5V, each
sub-band has a 275MHz tuning range. The total tuning range
of 860 MHz was obtained from 6.41GHz to 7.27GHz. Figure
5 shows the measurement results are drawn in. The tuning
voltage corresponding to 6.6GHz in the first sub-band (SUB1)
was around 1.17V. The tuning voltage corresponding to
7.128GHz in the fourth sub-band (SUB4) was around 1.08V.
The measurement results indicate that the difference of these
two tuning voltages was less than 0.1V. The difference should
ideally be zero because of the hopping time criterion.
