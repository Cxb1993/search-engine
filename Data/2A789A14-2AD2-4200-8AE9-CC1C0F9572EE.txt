英 文 摘 要 ： Carbon Monoxide (CO) boiler plays an important role 
in the petroleum-refining process. A CO boiler can 
produce 300 ton of steam per hour. This contributes 
nearly two billion$NT per year to a petroleum 
refinery! The loss caused by 
shutdown/inspection/maintenance of a CO boiler can be 
ten million$NT per day. Consequently, performance of 
a CO boiler has a detrimental influence on the 
operation and production of petrochemical industry, 
steel & iron industry and relevant industries.  
This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa 
Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the 
model for numerical investigation. The combustion and 
fluid flow in the FPC CO boiler is examined with 
emphasis on the discussion of the effect of reburning 
method upon the reduction of NOx. The ANSYS FLUENT 
12.1 commercial code is employed to simulate the 
reacting and fluid flow in the FPC CO boiler. The 
SIMPLE algorithm by Patankar is used to solve the 
governing equations. The discretizations of 
convection terms and diffusion terms are carried out 
by the power-law scheme and the central difference 
scheme, respectively. The standard k-ε Model, P-1 
radiation mode and non-premixed combustion model with 
β–type probability density function are adopted for 
turbulence, radiation and combustion simulations, 
respectively. The standard wall functions are used to 
resolve the flow quantities (velocity, temperature, 
and turbulence quantities) at the near-wall regions. 
  From the simulation results, the following 
conclusions may be drawn. 
壹、報告內容 
一、前言 
    隨著工業蓬勃發展與經濟活動日益擴張，導致大量的氮氧化物(NOx)、硫氧化物(SOx)、
煙灰(Soot)排放至大氣中，這些化合物是造成酸雨及光霧（smog）等空氣污染現象的主要來
源；一般通稱的 NOx包括 NO、NO2、NO3、N2O、N2O3、N2O4及 N2O5等七種化合物，在
大氣中只有 NO、NO2、NO3及 N2O能以穩定狀態存在，其中 NO、NO2及 N2O為一般空氣
污染物中所謂的 NOx，其主要來源為燃煤發電機、工業鍋爐及車輛排放等；NOx中以 NO2
對人體的傷害最大，當環境中 NO2濃度達到 0.25ppm時，大氣能見度即明顯下降，NO2對
於人體呼吸道也有刺激作用，會造成肺部機能衰退，降低對疾病的抵抗力而易受感染，如
氣管炎、肺炎等疾病的發生，根據研究報告指出，長時間暴露在 1ppm NO2的環境下，對
呼吸器官會造成極大的影響，甚至引發肺氣腫等疾病，而 NO在大氣環境中是形成 NO2的
前趨物質，在排入大氣後易與燃燒不完全的碳氫化合物進行光化學反應，生成強氧化性物
質，如臭氧、過氧乙硫硝酸鹽（PAN）等，造成光化學污染[1-3]。 
    燃燒器是燃燒設備中最基本且最重要的元件，主要功能是提供熱量，經能量轉換後，
或產生蒸氣，或作熱交換，以達到製程的需求，舉凡鍋爐、加熱爐、融熔爐、窯爐、焚化
爐等皆需使用到它，根據調查資料顯示，國內燃燒器市場每年的總需求量多達兩萬支以上，
然而，於此為數可觀的市場需求量中，進口依存度竟高達 70%以上，究其原因，一方面是
因為燃燒器之規格與種類繁多，大量生產困難，且國內專業性廠家有限，故多透過進出口
貿易商進行安裝、維修、及替換零件等工作，另一方面，燃燒器屬技術密集之高科技產品，
目前國內製造商大多無力自行開發，而仍以仿製為主。傳統燃燒器的使用多偏重在高效率
燃燒狀態下操作，卻常因無法有效控制空氣與燃料的混合，或因火焰溫度太高，而造成空
氣污染現象。對於燃燒煙氣所造成的污染，在傳統認知上，僅止於黑煙的抑制，對於煙氣
中的 SOx及 NOx，則較陌生，燃燒時所產生的空氣污染物質主要有微粒（particles）、SOx、
CO以及 NOx等，其中微粒及 SOx的生成主要是因為燃料中含有「灰質」及「硫」成份所
致，可經由燃料的前淨化處理、煙道氣水洗、除硫製程或靜電集塵等方式，將微粒及 SOx
有效抑制；CO的形成主要為燃燒反應不完全所造成，其含量高低通常是判斷燃燒完全與否
最直接有效的指標，亦為鍋爐燃燒操作的重要參數；NOx是經由燃燒製程所產生的污染排
放物，通常是由空氣中的氮氣及燃料中的含氮化合物氧化而生成，由於會造成酸雨及大氣
臭氧層的破壞，且一直被認為是空氣中過氧化物濃度過高的主要成因之一，因此，管制 NOx
的排放已成為各國政府的共識[4,5]。有鑒於國內外有關空氣污染之管制法規日益嚴格，改
善老舊燃燒器之 NOx排放量以符合現行環保法令之要求已成為產業界勢在必行的措施，但
在降低 NOx排放的同時，燃燒器的性能仍應滿足無黑煙、低 CO、低過剩氧之高效率燃燒
效果，才是真正好用的燃燒器。 
    一氧化碳鍋爐在煉油製程中占有非常重要的角色，它可以將再生器中的CO熱能回收再
利用，所產生的蒸汽可提供給其它設備使用，煉油廠對於蒸汽的使用需求量是非常大的，
一座一氧化碳鍋爐每小時約可產生300公噸的蒸氣，以蒸汽目前每公噸約770元的價格而
言，換算下來一座一氧化碳鍋爐每年可替煉油廠節省約20億元的成本，其貢獻不可小觑；
一氧化碳鍋爐使用再生器中的燃燒氣體(CO)為其入料，燃燒反應生成CO2並釋出大量的
熱，經由爐管熱交換產生過熱蒸汽；其構造分成氧化段（oxidizer section）、脫硝段（DeNOx 
section）、煙道氣冷卻段（flue gas cooling section）與脫硫段（DeSOx section），其內部裝設
耐火磚、撥水性岩棉或陶瓷棉毯等絕熱材質來保護爐體；煙道氣冷卻段（爐管區）分成水
幕段（screen section）、過熱段（superheater section）、蒸發段（vaporizer section）與節媒段

Poor performance of a carbon monoxide (CO) boiler can have a detrimental inﬂuence on the operation
and production of petrochemical industry, steel and iron industry and relevant industries. In this paper,
the combustion and ﬂuid ﬂow in a carbon monoxide boiler is examined. Inﬂuences of some important
parameters related to the geometry and operation of a CO boiler are discussed, including refractory thick-
ness, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone, inlet air ﬂowrate and inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate. It is found that when
the refractory is thickened, the skin friction coefﬁcient in the DeNOx section increases and arises later in
the ﬂow direction. Temperature and NO concentration increase in the DeNOx section and the larger the
ellipsoidal cone angle is, the larger the skin friction coefﬁcient will be. Compared with the original CO
boiler, refractory thickening alleviates the temperature and NO rise in the DeNOx section. For moderate
ellipsoidal cone angles, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the temperature rise in the DeNOx
section and this leads to a lower NO emission. On the other hand, as the ellipsoidal cone angle becomes
very large, the temperature rise in the DeNOx section is severer than for smaller ellipsoidal cone angles,
leading to higher NO emission. A lower excess air ﬂowrate can reduce the skin friction coefﬁcient, NO for-
mation and CO concentration, but the temperature increases. A higher ﬂue gas ﬂowrate can reduce the
NO formation and the CO concentration, but the temperature and the skin friction coefﬁcient increase.
On the other hand, when the ﬂue gas ﬂowrate is reduced, the temperature and the skin friction coefﬁcient
decrease, but the NO formation and CO concentration in the product increase.

1. Introduction
Carbon monoxide (CO) boilers play an important role in the
petroleum-reﬁning process. A CO boiler is composed of an oxidizer
section, a DeNOx section, a ﬂue gas cooler section, a DeSOx section,
and a stack. Interior surface of a CO boiler is fabricated with refrac-
tory to protect its wall. The ﬂue gas cooler section can be divided
into a screen/superheater section, a vaporizer section, and an econ-
omizer section. A CO boiler can retrieve thermal energy of CO from
the regenerator for various uses. It receives burning gas (CO) from
the regenerator as part of fuel which burns and releases a large
amount of heat. The hot ﬂue gas then ﬂows through the screen/
superheater section and exchanges heat with water in the cooling
tubes to produce superheated steam which can be used by other
equipment. Daily demand for steam in a petroleum reﬁnery is huge
and therefore a CO boiler can reduce the cost of a petroleum reﬁn-
ery. Conﬁguration of a CO boiler for a typical petroleum reﬁnery is
shown in Fig. 1.
The CO boiler is an important piece of equipment in the
Reduced Crude Conversion (RCC) process unit. Operating
temperature in a CO boiler can be as high as 1200 C, which may
lead to exterior or interior damage to the CO boiler. For example,
the refractory may be ruptured due to the high temperature in
the DeNOx section. The shutdown/inspection/maintenance of a
CO boiler can cause great loss to a petroleum reﬁnery. Further,
the potential threats to human safety and environment are signif-
icant. Consequently, the performance of a CO boiler has an impor-
tant inﬂuence on the operation and production of relevant
industries.
This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa Petrochemical
Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the model for numerical investiga-
tion. Conﬁguration and dimensions of the CO boiler investigated
are shown in Fig. 2. In a practical petroleum reﬁnery, a stack is used
for the emission of waste gas into the atmosphere and has little
inﬂuence on the reaction inside a boiler. Therefore, in the conﬁgu-
ration of the CO boiler shown in Fig. 2, the stack is ignored in order
to reduce the required memory and computing time.
The ﬂow ﬁeld in a CO boiler involves many complicated mech-
anisms, such as turbulent mixing, conduction/convection/radiation
heat transfer modes, combustion, as well as DeNOx and DeSOx
reactions. These mechanisms are all highly complex and may inter-
act with one another, making the analysis much more difﬁcult.
Some typical works are outlined below. Moghari et al. [1] analyzed
the thermal performance of a D-type water-cooled natural gas
ﬁred boiler by determining the temperature distributions of water

2.5. P-1 radiation model equation
The P-1 radiation model [12] is based on the expansion of the
radiation intensity into an orthogonal series of spherical harmon-
ics. If only four terms in the series are used, the following equation
is obtained for the radiation ﬂux qr:

ation G is:
r  ðCrGÞ  aGþ 4arT4 ¼ SG ð22Þ
where r is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and SG is a user-deﬁned
radiation source.
Combining Eqs. (20) and (22), the following equation is
obtained:

the gas phase from liquid fuel droplets or reacting particles (e.g.,

In respect of turbulence-chemistry interaction, the assumed-
shape probability density function (PDF, p(f))approach is applied
in this study. The probability density function describing the tem-
poral ﬂuctuations of f, p(f), in the turbulent ﬂow can be used to
compute the averaged values of variables (e.g. species fractions,
density, and temperature) that depend on f. For a single-mixture-
fraction system, density-weighted mean species mass fractions
and temperature can be computed as

On the other hand, when a secondary stream exists, the instanta-
neous values depend on the instantaneous fuel mixture fraction,
ffuel, and the secondary partial fraction, psec, i.e. ui =ui(ffuel,psec), where
ffuel, psec and fsec (secondary mixture fraction) are correlated by

shows the comparison of the computated radial mixture fraction
proﬁle with experimental data at different axial locations. It can
be seen that the trend of the computational result is consistent
with the experimental data. In the middle and downstream re-
gions, the computational result nearly coincides with the experi-
mental data.
3.2. Investigation of the combustion and ﬂuid ﬂow in a CO boiler
Having evaluated the numerical methods, the following discus-
sion investigates the FPC CO boiler. In this study, the numerical
model of the CO boiler is constructed by unstructured grid. Five cell
densities are tested to ensure a grid independence solution. They
include 49,658 cells, 73,857 cells, 198,546 cells, 349,411 cells,
and 545,753 cells. Computational results show that the recircula-
tion zone sizes of the DeNOx section and the cross-sectional
average temperature proﬁles obtained by the last two meshes
nearly coincide with deviation within 0.5%. Therefore, the mesh
of 349,411 cells is adopted for subsequent discussion.
In a practical CO boiler, deterioration of the refractory on the
wall of DeNOx section may occur. This phenomenon can seriously
damage the boiler and may be caused by the shear stress (friction)
of ﬂuid and the thermal stress due to local high temperature. In
this study, we attempt to alleviate the wall shear stress and tem-
perature by refractory thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal
cone, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In Fig. 8, S2 is the distance between
the starting point of the ﬂue gas cooler section and the central axis
of the cooling tube. S1 is the distance between the starting points of
the ﬂue gas cooler sections before and after refractory thickening.
In Fig. 9, h is the angle of the ellipsoidal cone, the length of the
ellipsoidal cone is the same as that of the DeNOx section, the max-
imum width of the ellipsoidal cone is 1.7 m, the diameter of the

the other hand, in the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m), when the
refractory is thickened, the solid surface area is increased and
therefore the skin friction coefﬁcient becomes larger. In addition,
because the DeNOx section is divergent (adverse pressure gradi-
ent), the ﬂuid decelerates and a recirculation zone forms (see
Figs. 11 and 13). The thicker the refractory is, the smaller the ad-
verse pressure gradient and hence the weaker the recirculation
would be. Therefore, when the refractory is thickened, the skin fric-
tion coefﬁcient arises later in the ﬂow direction due to the smaller
adverse pressure gradient. In the neighborhood of the cooling
tubes (x = 24.2 m), the skin friction coefﬁcient arises abruptly due
to the increase in solid surface area.
Fig. 15 compares cross-sectional average NOx concentration of
the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening.
As mentioned in Section 2, the NO species is the major concern and
its transport equation is solved in this study. Fig. 15 shows the dis-
tribution of the cross-sectional average NO concentration. It is ob-
served that the curves nearly coincide in the oxidizer section
(x 5 10.96 m), meaning that refractory thickening has little inﬂu-
ence on the NO formation in the oxidizer section. On the other
hand, the NO concentration in the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m)is
reduced by refractory thickening. As stated in Section 2, only ther-
mal NOx needs to be considered in this study. Thermal NOx is
formed by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen molecules pres-
ent in the combustion air and strongly depends on the tempera-
ture. When the refractory is thickened, the adverse pressure
gradient and the recirculation zone become smaller. Compared
with the original CO boiler, this leads to a lower temperature and
therefore a lower NO emission. Fig. 15 reveals this tendency. After
leaving the DeNOx section, the NO emission drops because tem-
perature decreases due to the cooling tubes.
3.2.3. Effect of insertion of an ellipsoidal cone on a CO boiler
Fig. 16 compares the cross-sectional average skin friction coef-
ﬁcients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoi-
dal cone. It can be seen that in the constant-area section

other hand, because the adverse pressure gradient in the DeNOx
section for the original CO boiler is larger, the skin friction coefﬁ-
cient arises earlier in the ﬂow direction due to the larger adverse
pressure gradient. In the neighborhood of the cooling tubes
(x = 24.2 m), the skin friction coefﬁcient arises abruptly due to
the increased solid surface area. However, because the ellipsoidal
cone can alleviate the adverse pressure gradient and the recircula-
tion strength, the increase in skin friction coefﬁcient in the neigh-
borhood of the cooling tubes is less severe for the CO boiler with an
ellipsoidal cone.
Fig. 18 compares cross-sectional average temperature for the
original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone. It
can be seen that in the oxidizer section (x 5 10.96 m), the cross-
sectional average temperature for the original CO boiler and the
CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone nearly coincide. On the other
hand, because the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m) is in the recircula-
tion zone (adverse pressure gradient) where the convective motion
is weak, the heat dissipation is poor and therefore the temperature
arises in the DeNOx section. Further, the ﬂow passage in the De-
NOx section becomes narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone and this
leads to a stronger convective motion, which alleviates the adverse
pressure gradient and the recirculation strength. Therefore, for
moderate ellipsoidal cone angles (30o and 60o), the temperature
arises later in the DeNOx section. On the other hand, as the ellip-
soidal cone angle becomes very large, e.g. 75o, the ﬂow passage
would be very narrow. This is not good for convective motion
due to the blockage effect of the ellipsoidal cone. Under such a sit-
uation, the temperature arises earlier in the DeNOx section than for
smaller ellipsoidal cone angles. After leaving the DeNOx section,
the temperature drops due to the cooling tubes.
Fig. 19 compares the cross-sectional average NO concentration
for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone.
It is observed that the curves nearly coincide in the oxidizer section
(x 5 10.96 m), meaning that the ellipsoidal cone has little inﬂuence
on NO formation in the oxidizer section. On the other hand, the NO
concentration in the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m) is reduced by
insertion of an ellipsoidal cone with a moderate cone angle (e.g.
h = 30o or h = 60o). As stated earlier, only thermal NOx needs to
be considered in this study and thermal NOx strongly depends
on temperature. From Fig. 18, for moderate ellipsoidal cone angles,
insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the temperature rise in
the DeNOx section. This leads to a lower NO emission. On the other
hand, as the ellipsoidal cone angle becomes very large, e.g. 75o,
temperature rise in the DeNOx section is severer than for smaller
ellipsoidal cone angles and this leads to a higher NO emission. After
leaving the DeNOx section, the NO emission drops because the
temperature decreases due to the cooling tubes.
From the above discussion, we can see that both refractory
thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the
temperature rise and NOx emission in a CO boiler. However, from
a practical point of view, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone into a CO
boiler requires more effort in construction and maintenance be-
cause the ellipsoidal cone and its support may encounter friction
and high temperature in the DeNOx section. Therefore, refractory
thickening is a preferable choice.
3.2.4. Effect of air ﬂowrate
As stated earlier, thermal NOx is formed by the oxidation of
atmospheric nitrogen molecules present in the combustion air.
Therefore, a lower inlet air ﬂowrate is helpful for reducing NOx
emission. Fig. 20 reveals this tendency. In Fig. 20, Qair represents
the inlet air ﬂowrate of the original CO boiler.
Note that the inlet air ﬂowrate may affect combustion. There-
fore, when a lower inlet air ﬂowrate is used, the combustion efﬁ-
ciency has to be monitored. The concentration of CO is a good
indicator of the measure of combustion. In general, the permissible
values of the CO concentration in combustion products lies in the
range of 150  250 ppm [21]. Fig. 21 shows the comparison of
cross-sectional average CO concentration for different inlet air
ﬂowrates in the main combustion region of the CO boiler. It can
be seen that with the two lower inlet air ﬂowrates (0.5Qair and
0.75Qair), the CO concentrations are acceptable, while with the
higher inlet air ﬂowrates (Qair and 1.25Qair), the CO concentrations
exceed the permissible values, implying that a higher inlet air
ﬂowrate results in a lower combustion efﬁciency. This may also
be observed from Fig. 22 that shows the comparison of cross-
sectional average temperature for different inlet air ﬂowrates. As
expected, the cross-sectional average temperature decreases with
the inlet air ﬂowrate. This is because the excess air increases with
the inlet air ﬂowrate and this leads to a reduction in cross-sectional

3.2.5. Effect of ﬂue gas ﬂowrate
To investigate the inﬂuence of ﬂue gas ﬂowrate on the CO boiler
operation, Fig. 24 shows the comparison of cross-sectional average
NO concentration for different inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates. It is ob-
served that the NO concentration decreases with ﬂue gas ﬂowrate.
As stated earlier, thermal NOx is formed by the oxidation of atmo-
spheric nitrogen molecules present in the combustion air. When
the ﬂue gas ﬂowrate is increased, the oxygen concentration react-
ing with atmospheric nitrogen molecules is decreased because
some oxygen molecules react with the ﬂue gas. This is helpful for
NOx reduction. Fig. 24 reveals this tendency. In Fig. 24, Qﬂue repre-
sents the inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate of the original CO boiler.
Note that, similar to the inlet air ﬂowrate, inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate
may affect combustion. Therefore, when the ﬂue gas ﬂowrate is
changed, the combustion efﬁciency has to be monitored. Again,
the CO concentration is adopted as an indicator of the measure
of combustion. Fig. 25 shows the comparison of cross-sectional
average CO concentration for different inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates. It
can be seen that with the two higher inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates
(1.25Qﬂue and 1.54Qﬂue), the CO concentrations are acceptable (in
the range of 150  250 ppm [21]), while with the lower inlet ﬂue
gas ﬂowrates (Qﬂue and 0.8Qﬂue), the CO concentrations exceed per-
missible values, implying that a lower inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate re-
sults in a lower combustion efﬁciency. This may also be observed
from Fig. 26, which shows the comparison of cross-sectional aver-
age temperature for different inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates. Contrary to
the case of the inlet air ﬂowrate (Fig. 22), the cross-sectional aver-
age temperature increases with the inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate. This is
because the inlet ﬂue gas comes from the RCC (Reduced Crude Con-
version Process) unit which operates at a high temperature. In
addition, the ﬂue gas contains CO which can further react with
O2 and release heat. When the inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate increases,
the heat released increases and therefore the cross-sectional aver-
age temperature also increases. Table 4, which shows the compar-
ison of maximum temperature for different inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates,
also reveals this tendency.
Fig. 27 shows the comparison of the cross-sectional average
skin friction coefﬁcient for different inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrates. It
can be seen that, similar to the case of inlet air ﬂowrate, a higher
inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate leads to a larger wall shear stress because
a higher ﬂue gas ﬂowrate gives rise to a higher velocity distribu-
tion, which in turn results in a larger wall shear stress. As stated
earlier, this may seriously damage the CO boiler.
From the above discussion, it is noted that although the NO and
CO concentrations decrease with the inlet ﬂue gas ﬂowrate, the

We present a numerical investigation of the heat transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow in a Carbon Monoxide (CO) boi-
ler. The inﬂuences of some important parameters related to the geometry of a CO boiler are also dis-
cussed, including the refractory thickness and the insertion of an ellipsoidal cone. The purpose is to
improve the performance of a CO boiler, especially to alleviate hot spots, which may lead to deterioration
of the refractory. It is found that the skin friction coefﬁcient arises earlier in the DeNOx section when the
refractory is thinner. Refractory thickening leads to a lower temperature in the DeNOx section. After leav-
ing the DeNOx section, the temperature reduces due to the cooling pipes and the skin friction coefﬁcient
arises abruptly near the cooling pipes. It is also found that insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can lower the
temperature in the DeNOx section and there is a larger skin friction coefﬁcient with a larger ellipsoidal
cone angle. After leaving the DeNOx section, the skin friction coefﬁcient and the temperature both
decrease. Finally, based on the result of this research and from a practical point of view, refractory thick-
ening is a preferable choice for reducing friction, pressure drop and temperature in a CO boiler.

1. Introduction
Burners are the most important element of combustion systems
such as boilers, heaters, furnaces or incinerators. The main function
of a burner is to create heat energy through combustion. The heat
energy can then be converted to kinetic energy in other equipment,
such as a turbine, or used to produce steam via heat exchanger use
in manufacturing processes. Lee et al. [1] used a simpliﬁed model
of a heat exchanger and pilot condensing boiler to investigate the
design factors for a heat exchanger and boiler. Speciﬁcations of
each heat exchanger component were investigated using a model
apparatus, and the comprehensive performance of the pilot gas
boiler was examined experimentally. The heating efﬁciency of
the boiler developed was compared to a conventional Bunsen-type
boiler. Main and Maghon [2] presented different measures for an
optimized boiler, evaluating six important parameters: reduction
of excess air, ﬂue gas temperature at boiler outlet, higher steam
parameters (pressure and temperature), heating surfaces for steam
superheating in the radiation boiler section, steam reheating, and
external superheaters using auxiliary fuels. Franco and Diaz [3]
described the state of the art in the ﬁeld of ‘‘clean coal technolo-
gies’’ showing the perspectives of improvement and the critical
elements. They reviewed and analyzed the emission control of
nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and particle matter as
well as advanced coal conversion pathways such as ultra-super-
critical (USC), pressurized ﬂuidized bed combustion (PFBC), and
integrated gasiﬁcation combined cycle (IGCC). This paper also out-
lined some aspects of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission control strat-
egies. Shin et al. [4] developed a comprehensive computer program
using the SIMPLE algorithm by Patankar to evaluate the efﬁciency
of a selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system for a boiler.
The standard k–e turbulence model and eddy breakup model were
incorporated to analyze the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent
reaction of major fuel species, respectively. Their calculations
showed that the removal efﬁciency of nitric oxide (also known as
nitrogen monoxide; NO) was signiﬁcantly improved by increasing
penetration depth of the reducing agent into the center region of
boiler. Javed et al. [5] presented a review of NOx removal tech-
niques with particular reference to SNCR technology. A review of
various features related to selective non-catalytic gas phase injec-
tion of ammonia and ammonium salts (as reducing agent) was pre-
sented. Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) modeling was also
applied to SNCR. In addition, a two-stage NOx removal strategy
to control un-reacted ammonia slip and to improve overall efﬁ-
ciency was discussed and a summary highlighted various areas
needing further research was given. In 2006, the American Petro-
leum Institute (API) [6] provided guidelines for the selection and/
or evaluation of burners installed in ﬁred heaters in general reﬁn-
ery services. Details of ﬁred heater and related equipment designs
were considered only where they interact with the burner selec-
tion. This standard provides information and descriptions of burner

For the steady-state, three-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld with heat

In Eq. (28), um is the mean axial velocity at the inlet, D is the curved
tube diameter and t is the kinematic viscosity.
Five sets of grid meshes (51  17  17, 101  33  33,
101  41  41, 151  61  61, and 201  81  81) are used to en-
sure grid independence. Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the com-
puted axial velocity proﬁle with the experimental data at h = 90
on the symmetric plane for the 90 curved tube ﬂow. It can be seen
that the computational result is very close to the experimental
data.

In Eq. (29), uh is the driving velocity, R is the radius of the rotating
cylinder and t is the kinematic viscosity. The diameter of the rotat-
ing cylinder (2R) is 95 mm and its length (in the z-direction) is
400 mm. The radial walls are 47.5 mm apart and the opening angle
is 1 radian. Five sets of uniform grid meshes (21  21  11,
33  33  17, 41  41  21, 51  51  26 and 51  51  51
(r  h  z)) are used to ensure grid independence. Fig. 7 shows the
comparison of the computed velocity proﬁle with the experimental
data at z = 100mm (1/4 the cavity length from the end wall),
h = 20 for the three-dimensional polar cavity ﬂow. Again, it is
seen that the computational result is very close to the experimental
data.

where l = 0.07L and L is the hydraulic diameter. Five sets of uniform

2101  251) are calculated to test grid independence. For the last
two sets of grid meshes, the Nusselt number proﬁles at the surfaces
of the 5th period of rib nearly coincide. Therefore, the solution by
grid mesh of 1681  201 is chosen for comparison with the exper-

the experimental data at the surfaces of the 5th period of rib. The

3.2. Effect of refractory thickening on a CO boiler
Having evaluated the numerical methods, the following discus-
sion investigates the FPC CO boiler. The simulation conditions are
provided by Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, and the ﬂuid is
air, with inlet pressure of atmospheric pressure. At the primary
air inlet, velocity is 5.885 m/s, temperature is 300 K, turbulence ki-
netic energy is 10% of the inlet mean ﬂow kinetic energy, and tur-
bulence dissipation rate is computed from Eq. (32) with hydraulic
diameter L = 0.944 m. At the secondary air inlet, velocity is
40.154 m/s, temperature is 300 K, turbulence kinetic energy is
10% of the inlet mean ﬂow kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipa-
tion rate is computed from Eq. (32) with hydraulic diameter L of
either 0.2 m or 0.25 m (see Fig. 3(e)). At the ﬂue gas inlet, velocity
is 13.35 m/s, temperature is 877 K, turbulence kinetic energy is
10% of the inlet mean ﬂow kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipa-
tion rate is computed from Eq. (32) with hydraulic diameter
L = 0.912 m. Heat absorption rate of the ﬂue gas cooling pipes is
26,572 w/m2 and the other walls are adiabatic. No slip condition
is applied at all solid walls. Atmosphere at the exit is taken as a
cube with side length of twenty times the exit diameter of the DeS-
Ox section. The atmosphere is at 300 K and 1 atm.
In an actual CO boiler, deterioration of refractory on the wall of
DeNOx section can occur, as shown in Fig. 2. This phenomenon can
cause serious damage to the boiler and may result from shear
stress (friction) of the ﬂuid and thermal stress due to the local high

wall shear stress and temperature by refractory thickening and
insertion of an ellipsoidal cone, as discussed below.
In this study, a numerical model of the CO boiler is constructed
by unstructured grid. Five cell densities are tested to ensure grid
independence solution. They include 49,658 cells, 73,857 cells,
198,546 cells, 349,411 cells, and 545,753 cells. Computational re-

pipe. S1 is the distance between the starting points of the ﬂue gas
cooler sections before and after refractory thickening.
Fig. 13 shows the velocity vector proﬁles on the symmetric
plane (z = 0) for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with
refractory thickening. It can be seen that refractory thickening
has very little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer and DeSOx
sections. This is because the refractory is thickened at the DeNOx
section and therefore only the DeNOx section and the ﬂue gas cool-
er section (downstream of the DeNOx section) are inﬂuencedmore.
Fig. 14 compares cross-sectional average skin friction coefﬁ-
cients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory
thickening. The skin friction coefﬁcient is deﬁned as the ratio of
the wall shear stress and the reference dynamic pressure,
Cf  sw1

where sw is the wall shear stress, and qref and vref are the refer-
ence density and velocity. In this study, qref and vref are taken as
the default values in FLUENT code (qref = 1.225 kg/m3, vref = 1 m/
s).
Because Fig. 13 shows that refractory thickening has very little
inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections and
only the DeNOx section and ﬂue gas cooler section are inﬂuenced
more, Fig. 14 compares cross-sectional average skin friction coef-
ﬁcients only in the DeNOx and ﬂue gas cooler sections (x = 8.7–
24.2 m). It can be seen that in the constant-area section
(x = 8.7–10.96 m), the skin friction coefﬁcients for the original
CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening nearly
coincide. This is consistent with the result of Fig. 13, which shows
that refractory thickening has very little inﬂuence on the ﬂow
ﬁeld in the oxidizer section. On the other hand, because the De-
NOx section (x = 10.96 m) is divergent (adverse pressure gradi-
ent) , the ﬂuid decelerates and a recirculation zone forms
(Fig. 13(c) and (d)). The thicker the refractory is, the smaller the
adverse pressure gradient would be. Therefore, when the refrac-
tory is thickened, the skin friction coefﬁcient arises later in the
ﬂow direction due to the lower adverse pressure gradient. In con-
trast, when the refractory is thinner, the skin friction coefﬁcient
arises earlier in the ﬂow direction due to the larger adverse pres-
sure gradient. In the neighborhood of the cooling pipes
(x = 24.2 m), the skin friction coefﬁcient arises abruptly due to
the increase of solid surface area.
Fig. 15 shows the temperature proﬁles on the symmetric (z = 0)
and lateral (z = 1.44 m) planes for the original CO boiler and the CO
boiler with refractory thickening. It can be seen that high temper-
ature regions are concentrated in those regions where convective
motion is weak, e.g. upper portion of the oxidizer section, DeNOx
section, upstream region of the ﬂue gas cooler section, and DeSOx
section. These regions are all characterized by recirculation. Similar
to Fig. 13, refractory thickening has minor inﬂuence on the temper-
ature proﬁle in the oxidizer section. Only the DeNOx section and
the ﬂue gas cooler section are inﬂuenced more.
Fig. 16 compares the cross-sectional average temperature for
the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening.
It can be seen that in the constant-area section (x = 8.7–10.96 m),
temperatures for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with
refractory thickening nearly coincide. This is consistent with the
results of Figs. 13 and 15 which indicate that refractory thickening
has little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer section. On the
other hand, because the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m) is divergent
(adverse pressure gradient), the ﬂuid decelerates and recirculation
zone forms. Since a recirculation zone is a region where convective
motion is weak and hence heat dissipation is not good, the temper-
ature arises in the DeNOx section. When the refractory is thick-
ened, the adverse pressure gradient and the recirculation zone
become smaller. This leads to a lower temperature as compared
to the original CO boiler. After leaving the DeNOx section, the tem-
perature drops due to the heat absorption effect of the cooling
pipes.
In order to see what happens if refractory spalls and is lost, we
have added the case of decreasing refractory thickness, S1/
S2 = 0.5. From Fig. 16, it is observed that the temperature for S1/
S2 = 0.5 is higher than the other cases, since the adverse pressure
gradient and the recirculation zone become larger when the refrac-
tory thickness is decreased and this leads to a higher temperature
as compared to the other cases.
3.3. Effect of insertion of an ellipsoidal cone on a CO boiler
Fig. 17 illustrates the insertion of an ellipsoidal cone for the De-
NOx section of a CO boiler. In Fig. 17, h is the angle of the ellipsoidal
cone, the length of the ellipsoidal cone is the same as that of the
DeNOx section, the maximum width of the ellipsoidal cone is
1.7 m, the diameter of the support is 0.32 m, and the distance be-
tween the support and the end point of the DeNOx section is 1 m.
Fig. 18 shows the velocity vector proﬁles on the symmetric
plane (z = 0) for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone (those for
the original CO boiler can be referred to in Fig. 13). It can be seen
that, as for the case of refractory thickening, the ellipsoidal cone
has little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer and DeSOx sec-
tions. This is because the ellipsoidal cone is inserted at the DeNOx
section and therefore only the DeNOx section and the ﬂue gas cool-
er section (downstream of the DeNOx section) are inﬂuencedmore.
The oxidizer section is upstream of the ellipsoidal cone and the
DeSOx section is far from the ellipsoidal cone and therefore the
ellipsoidal cone has little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer
and DeSOx sections.
In ﬂuid mechanics, an ellipsoidal cone is a blunt body that forms
a low-pressure wake ﬂow region downstream. The wake ﬂow is a
region of low pressure and weak convection. The larger the ellip-
soidal cone angle is, the larger the wake ﬂow region would be.
Fig. 18 shows that the ellipsoidal cone interferes with the recircu-
lation zone in the DeNOx section of the original CO boiler. This is
because the ﬂow passage in the DeNOx section becomes narrower
due to the ellipsoidal cone and this leads to a stronger convective
motion, which alleviates the recirculation strength in the DeNOx
section.
Fig. 19 compares cross-sectional average skin friction coefﬁ-
cients for the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with an ellipsoi-
dal cone. Because Fig. 18 shows that insertion of an ellipsoidal cone
has little inﬂuence on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the oxidizer and DeSOx sec-
tions and only the DeNOx section and ﬂue gas cooler section are
inﬂuenced more, Fig. 19 compares cross-sectional average skin
friction coefﬁcients only in the DeNOx and ﬂue gas cooler sections
(x = 8.7–24.2 m). It can be seen that in the constant-area section
(x = 8.7–10.96 m), the skin friction coefﬁcient for the CO boiler
with an ellipsoidal cone is smaller, which is different from the case
of refractory thickening in which the skin friction coefﬁcients for
the original CO boiler and the CO boiler with refractory thickening
nearly coincide. This is because the ﬂuid motion is slowed down by
the ellipsoidal cone (from computational results, the average
velocity is decreased by about 0.5% in the existence of an ellipsoi-
dal cone). On the other hand, in the DeNOx section (x = 10.96 m),
the solid surface area increases due to the ellipsoidal cone. The lar-
ger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the larger the solid surface area
and therefore the larger the skin friction coefﬁcient would be. In
addition, the skin friction coefﬁcient increases abruptly close to
the support (x = 18.09 m) because of the increased solid surface
area due to the support. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is,
the shorter the support would be. Therefore, for a larger ellipsoidal
cone angle, the increase in the solid surface area due to the exis-

1. Refractory thickening has little inﬂuence on heat transfer and
ﬂuid ﬂow in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections. On the other
hand, in the DeNOx section, the skin friction coefﬁcient arises
earlier in the ﬂow direction when the refractory is thinner. In
addition, the temperature arises in the DeNOx section. Refrac-
tory thickening leads to a lower temperature in the DeNOx sec-
tion than for the original CO boiler. After leaving the DeNOx
section, the temperature reduces due to the cooling pipes and
the skin friction coefﬁcient arises abruptly near the cooling
pipes.
2. Insertion of an ellipsoidal cone has little inﬂuence on the heat
transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow in the oxidizer and DeSOx sections. In
the constant-area section between the oxidizer and DeNOx sec-
tions, different from the case of refractory thickening, the skin
friction coefﬁcient for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone is
smaller and the temperature is lower. On the other hand, in
the DeNOx section, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can lower
the temperature and there is a larger skin friction coefﬁcient
with a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. However, as the ellipsoidal
cone angle becomes very large, the temperature in the DeNOx
section increases. Furthermore, the skin friction coefﬁcient
increases abruptly near support and this phenomenon is less
severe for a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. After leaving the
DeNOx section and entering the ﬂue gas cooler section, the skin
friction coefﬁcient and the temperature both decrease. With a
larger ellipsoidal cone angle, the skin friction coefﬁcient drops
more quickly. For the original CO boiler, the skin friction coefﬁ-
cient arises earlier in the ﬂow direction. Near the cooling pipes,
the skin friction coefﬁcient arises abruptly and this phenome-
non is less severe for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone.
3. Based on the result of this research and from a practical point of
view, refractory thickening is a preferable choice for reducing
friction, pressure drop and temperature in a CO boiler.

 Conversion(RCC)Process Unit. The shutdown/inspection/maintenance of a CO boiler has a 
significant influence on the production process of a petroleum refinery and the loss can be as high as 
one million US$ per day. Furthermore, the potential threats to human safety and the environment are 
significant. Consequently, the performance of a CO boiler has an important influence on the 
operation and production of related industries.  
This study uses a CO boiler of the Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the 
model for numerical investigation. The configuration and dimensions of the CO boiler investigated is 
shown in Fig.2.

The flow field in a CO boiler involves many complicated mechanisms, such as turbulent mixing, 
convection and radiation heat transfer modes, combustion, as well as DeNOx and DeSOx reactions. 
These mechanisms are all highly complex and may interact with each other, which makes the analysis 
much more difficult. Hassan et al. [1] simulated the combustion process occurring in the combustion

 (x=18.09m) because of the increased solid surface area due to the support. The larger the ellipsoidal 
cone angle is, e.g. θ=60o and θ=75o, the shorter the support would be. Therefore, for a larger 
ellipsoidal cone angle, the increase in the solid surface area due to the existence of the support would 
be smaller, and hence the increase in the skin friction coefficient would be less severe. Fig.7 shows 
the velocity vector profiles in the DeSOx section on the symmetric plane (z=0) for the CO boiler with 
an ellipsoidal cone. In fluid mechanics, an ellipsoidal cone is a blunt body that forms a low-pressure 
wake flow region downstream. The wake flow is a region of low pressure and weak convection. The 
larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the larger the wake flow region would be. Fig.7 shows that the 
ellipsoidal cone interferes with the recirculation zone in the DeNOx section of the original CO boiler. 
This is because the flow passage in the DeNOx section becomes narrower due to the ellipsoidal cone 
and this leads to a stronger convective motion, which alleviates the adverse pressure gradient and the 
recirculation strength in the DeNOx section. Therefore, it can be seen from Fig.6 that the skin friction 
coefficient decreases after leaving the DeNOx section. The larger the ellipsoidal cone angle is, the 
smaller the adverse pressure gradient would be, and hence the faster the skin friction coefficient 
drops. On the other hand, because the adverse pressure gradient in the DeNOx section for the original 
CO boiler is larger, the skin friction coefficient arises earlier in the flow direction due to the larger 
adverse pressure gradient. In the neighborhood of the cooling pipes (x=24.2m), the skin friction 
coefficient arises abruptly due to the increased solid surface area. However, because the ellipsoidal 
cone can alleviate the adverse pressure gradient and the recirculation strength, the increase of skin 
friction coefficient in the neighborhood of the cooling pipes is less severe for the CO boiler with an 
ellipsoidal cone.

 reduced by insertion of an ellipsoidal cone with a moderate cone angle(e.g. θ=30o or θ=60o). As stated 
earlier, thermal NOx is formed by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen molecules present in the 
combustion air and is strongly dependent on temperature. From Fig.8, for moderate ellipsoidal cone 
angles, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the temperature rise in the DeNOx section. This 
leads to a lower NO emission. On the other hand, Fig.8 shows that as the ellipsoidal cone angle 
becomes very large, e.g. 75o, the temperature rise in the DeNOx section is severer than for smaller 
ellipsoidal cone angles and this leads to a higher NO emission. 
Conclusions 
This study discusses the influences of refractory thickening and of inserting an ellipsoidal cone on 
the reacting flow and NOx formation in a CO boiler in order to improve the operation safety and 
service life of a CO boiler as well as to reduce the NOx formation from the boiler. The FLUENT 
commercial code is employed to simulate the three-dimensional reacting flow in a CO boiler of the 
Formosa Petrochemical Corporation in Taiwan. From the simulation results, it is found that insertion 
of an ellipsoidal cone has little influence on the reacting flow and NOx formation in the oxidizer 
section. For moderate ellipsoidal cone angles, insertion of an ellipsoidal cone can alleviate the 
temperature rise in the DeNOx section. As the ellipsoidal cone angle becomes very large, the 
temperature rise in the DeNOx section is severer than for smaller ellipsoidal cone angles. In the 
DeNOx section, there is a larger skin friction coefficient with a larger ellipsoidal cone angle. The skin 
friction coefficient increases abruptly near support and this phenomenon is less severe for a larger 
ellipsoidal cone angle. With a larger ellipsoidal cone angle, the skin friction coefficient drops more 
quickly. For the original CO boiler, the skin friction coefficient arises earlier in the flow direction. 
Near the cooling pipes, the skin friction coefficient arises abruptly and this phenomenon is less severe 
for the CO boiler with an ellipsoidal cone. Finally, NOx emission in the DeNOx section can be 
alleviated by refractory thickening and insertion of an ellipsoidal cone.
