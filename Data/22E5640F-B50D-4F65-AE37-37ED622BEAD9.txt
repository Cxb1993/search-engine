Abstract 
Pulmonary tuberculosis remains one of the major public health issues worldwide.  However, 
concentration profiles of airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis in hospitals and other medical 
facilities have not been well characterized.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to 
measure concentration profiles of airborne M. t. in a hospital including TB-patient related areas 
(TB-areas), and non-TB-patient related areas (non-TB-areas).  A total of 58 airborne samples 
were collected by a filter and quantified by real-time qPCR system. 
It was found that the airborne M. t. concentrations in TB-areas were significantly higher than 
those in non-TB-areas.  In regard to the profiles in the investigated hospital, the airborne M. t. 
concentrations from high to low were found in the waiting rooms and consulting rooms of 
medical department, emergency department, medical wards, main registry area, waiting rooms of 
ophthalmology department, and dining hall, respectively.  In the medical wards area, it was 
found that the airborne M. t. concentrations in the room of a suspected TB patient were even 
higher than those found in negative pressure isolation rooms with TB patient.  This suspected 
TB patient was, in fact, diagnosed as a TB patient a month later.  In conclusion, concentration 
profiles of airborne M. t. in hospital environments were successfully characterized in our present 
study.  In addition, it was strongly demonstrated that TB-areas do have higher airborne M. t. 
concentrations than non-TB-areas and implicate higher risks for nosocomial TB infection.  
Moreover, environmental monitoring of airborne M. t. might provide an early indicator for 
identification of TB patient.  
Keywords: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, real-time qPCR, hospital
studies were only qualitative, it still revealed that nosocomial TB infection should be 
a subject of concern to health workers and the public in Taiwan.  Furthermore, this 
method is only a qualitative or semi-quantitative way with positive or negative 
responses in a narrow dynamic range (less than four orders of magnitude) (Schafer et 
al., 1998; Schafer et al., 1999).  A quantitative method for airborne M. tuberculosis 
evaluation is critically important to identify high risk areas for infection control and 
risk assessment.  
Recently, rapid identification methods using molecular techniques have been 
developed and utilized in the clinical laboratory (Broccolo et al., 2003; Sechi et al., 
2003; Kraus et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2002; Shretha et al., 2003).  The real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) is a commercially available 
system designed to decrease the time of PCR assays by monitoring the amplification 
of the target sequences in real time by fluorescent probes.  In our previous study 
(Chen and Li, 2005), we successfully demonstrated that the filter/real-time qPCR is a 
very sensitive and quick method to quantify airborne M. tuberculosis.  It can perform 
measurements of counts over 6 orders of magnitude dynamic range with a great 
sensitivity.  In addition, the airborne M. tuberculosis concentrations were found to 
vary widely from 1.43 x 10 copy/m3 to 2.06 x 105 copy/m3 in negative pressure 
isolation rooms of TB patients in a TB center.  This newly established technique is 
very promising for detecting airborne TB and can be further used for airborne TB 
profile investigation in different parts of hospital.   
 
Aim 
The aim of the present study was to use this rapid and high-throughput real-time 
quantitative PCR-based method for directly measuring concentration profiles of 
airborne M. tuberculosis in a hospital including TB-patient related areas (TB-areas), 
and non-TB-patient related areas (non-TB-areas).  TB-areas included (1) medical 
wards with TB patients (negative pressure isolation rooms) and suspected TB patients, 
(2) waiting rooms and consulting rooms of medical department, and (3) the negative 
pressure isolation rooms, nursing stations outside negative pressure isolation room, 
adult medicine rooms, and adult medicine observation area in emergency department.  
Non-TB-areas included (1) medical wards without TB patients, (2) waiting rooms of 
ophthalmology department, (3) the area of pediatric in emergency department, and (4) 
public-concerned areas (dining hall and main registry area).  This study might 
provide a better understanding of airborne M. tuberculosis distribution in hospital and 
of how to protect the public and health care personnel from nosocomial TB infection 
in hospitals.  
 
Materials and Method 
Air sampling 
For the filter/real-time qPCR assay, air samples were filtered through a Nuclepore 
filter (Costar, Cambridge, MA), a track-etched polycarbonate filter consisting of a 
polycarbonate membrane with straight-through pores of a uniform size.  Filters with 
0.4 μm pore size and 37 mm diameter supported by cellulose pads were loaded into 
open-face three-piece plastic cassettes.  Filters and support pads were autoclaved and 
plastic cassettes were sterilized with ethylene oxide before sampling.  The nuclepore 
filter was operated at 20 L/min with sampling time of 8 hr (from 9 am to 5 pm) every 
day for all the sampling areas.  However, the sampling time was only 4 hours (8 am 
to 12 or 1 pm to 5pm) in the waiting rooms and consulting rooms to match up the 
consulting period of the hospital.  The pump and filter apparatus were placed within 
  3
Standard curve 
The target DNA standard solution from cloning plasmid was purchased from 
Mission Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan).  The threshold was set at 10 times the standard 
deviation of the mean baseline emission calculated for PCR cycles 3 to 10.  The 
amount of product in a particular reaction mixture is measured by interpolation from a 
standard curve of cycle threshold (Ct) values generating from known starting 
concentration of DNA at the same run.  The positive (purified dilutions of plasmid 
DNA), negative controls and standard curve were analyzed with each run.   
 
Inhibitory effect  
In field studies, one of the most important factors needed to be carefully 
considered was the interference of different medium.  Because air samples may 
contain compounds inhibitory to amplification assay, determination of environmental 
interferences is necessary to assess the utility of PCR for different environments.  
Samples which contained 103 to 104 CFU of environmental organisms per m3 
inhibited amplification; however, a 1/10 dilution of these samples resulted in 
successful amplifications (Alvarez et al., 1995).  Therefore, the interference could be 
corrected by serial dilution of samples (Alvarez et al., 1995).  In the present study, 
the interference was corrected by 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000 dilutions of all the samples.  
If DNA was quantified in 1/10, 1/100, or 1/1000 diluted solution, the true 
concentration was corrected by multiplying the detected concentration by 10, 100 or 
1000, respectively.  Inhibitory samples were initially negative and then became 
positive after dilution.  In our current study,  there are 60 % of positive samples 
with inhibitory effect (data not shown).   
 
Statistical Methods 
Software used for data analysis included Excel for Windows XP, version 7.0 
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and SigmaPlot for Windows, version 3.06 (SPSS, 
Chicago, IL). The differences were examined using t test. 
 
Result and Discussion 
In this investigation, the well-established high-throughput real-time quantitative 
PCR-based method was used for measuring concentration profiles of airborne M. 
tuberculosis in the hospital environments.  Since the positive, negative controls and 
standard curve were analyzed with each run, every sample would have a parallel 
standard curve.  Figure 1 shows one of the standard curves of known M. tuberculosis 
DNA concentrations and threshold cycle (Ct) by real-time qPCR.  The known 
amounts of M. tuberculosis plasmid DNA yielded Ct values ranging from 20 to 40 
cycles (triplicate standards, with coefficients of variation were less than 3%).  The 
standard curves were linear for over 7 orders of magnitude, ranging from 2.8 copies/μl 
to 2.8 x 107 copies/μl, with a correlation coefficient (r) value of 0.995.  Since filters 
were eluted into 2 ml, the detection limit of the method is 2.8 * 2000 /9.6 = 583 
copy/m3.  If the positive results was observed in the 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000 dilution 
samples due to the inhibitory effect, the detection limit should be 58 copy/m3, 5.8 
copy/m3 , and 0.6 copy/m3, respectively. 
Figure 2 highlights the differences of the airborne M. tuberculosis concentrations 
between TB-areas and non-TB-areas.  These data indicated that the airborne M. 
tuberculosis concentrations in TB-areas (with average 3.8 x 103 ± 1.7 x 103 copy/m3) 
were significantly higher than those in non-TB-areas (3.9 x 100 ± 2.1 x 100 copy/m3) 
(p=0.029).  Our study is the first report to demonstrate that TB-areas do have 
  5
copy/m3 on May 18 and 5.2 x 104, 1.3 x 103 copy/m3 on May 19.  In addition, high 
airborne M. tuberculosis concentration was also observed outside the negative 
pressure isolation room and might be related to operation status of the two-door 
system of the negative pressure isolation room.   
The third highest area in the investigated hospital was the ward area of the medical 
department (1.0 x 102 ± 5.5 x 101 copy/m3, range: below the lower limit of detection 
to 9.9 x 102 copy/m3) (Fig. 3).  The profile of four investigated areas in medical ward 
area, wards with non-TB patients, wards with TB patients (negative pressure isolation 
rooms), wards with suspected TB patients and nursing stations, is shown in Figure 5.  
The airborne M. tuberculosis concentrations in medical wards with non-TB patients 
were close to the lower limit of detection (0.8 ± 0.4 copy/m3, range: below the lower 
limit of detection to 2 copy/m3).  In addition, air samples from three different nursing 
stations of medical wards were all below the lower limit of detection.  With the 
presence of a suspected TB patient in the ward, the monitored levels were 1.9 x 102 
copy/m3 and 9.9 x 102 copy/m3, which were even higher than those found in negative 
pressure isolation rooms with TB patient.  At the beginning, this patient was not 
hospitalized for TB.  After detecting high M. tuberculosis concentration from air 
samples, this patient was then checked by symptoms, sputum smear, and chest 
radiograph, and diagnosed as a TB patient a month later.  Therefore, environmental 
airborne M. tuberculosis monitoring could provide an early indicator for TB patient.   
In regard to the negative pressure isolation rooms with TB patients, the airborne 
M. tuberculosis (8.2 x 101 ± 2.7 x 103 copy/m3, range: 6 copy/m3 to 2.2 x 102 copy/m3) 
were found to be significantly higher (p=0.018) than those in nursing stations and 
medical wards with non-TB patients.  The positive rate of air samples from the 
negative pressure isolation rooms was 100%.  The air exchange rate of negative 
pressure isolation rooms was found to be in the range of 8.8 /hr to 9.2 /hr and meets 
the suggested range (8-12 /hr) (ASHRAE Handbook, 1995).  For pressure difference 
of negative pressure isolation room, only one room (7.8 pa) was slightly lower than 
the suggested value (> 8 pa).  In the previous studies, most samples of airborne M. 
tuberculosis were analyzed by PCR and demonstrated the results as positive rate 
(Mastorides et al. 1999; Wan et al., 2004).  The positive rate (100%) in the negative 
pressure isolation rooms in our study was higher than those in Wan’s study (59%) 
(Wan et al., 2004) and Mastorides’s study (86%) (Mastorides et al. 1999).  
Ventilation design, patient condition, and even the detection limits might be the 
explanations.  In comparison with our previous study, the positive rate (100%) in the 
negative pressure isolation rooms in the present study appeared to be consistent with 
those in the negative pressure isolation rooms in a TB center (Chen and Li, 2005).  
However, the concentration range was much wider in TB center (1.4 x 101 copy/m3 to 
2.0 x 105 copy/m3) than in our present study.  These differences might be explained 
by ventilation design and patient condition.  Furthermore, it was revealed that 
quantitative data might give insight into the problems.  
For public-concerned areas, the dining hall and main registry area were studied 
(fig. 3).  It was found that the airborne M. tuberculosis concentration range of dining 
hall was from below the lower limit of detection to 3.0 x 100 copy/m3 (1.5 x 100 ± 0.9 
x 100 copy/m3), and the positive rate was 50%.  Among the five main areas 
investigated, the lowest concentration was observed in dining hall (fig 3).  In the 
main registry area, the airborne M. tuberculosis concentration range was from below 
the lower limit of detection to 3.7 x 101 copy/m3 (1.9 x 101 ± 1.1 x 101 copy/m3) and 
the positive rate was 50%.  Although the airborne M. tuberculosis concentration in 
the main registry area was about two orders of magnitudes lower than those in
