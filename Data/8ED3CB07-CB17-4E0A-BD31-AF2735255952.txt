Folate-conjugated Micellar Photosensitizer for Targetable Photodynamic 
Therapy 
 
Abstract 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a light-induced chemical reaction that produces localized 
tissue damage for the treatment of cancers and other nonmalignant conditions. The activation 
of photosensitizers in a target tissue is accomplished using a specific light source in the 
presence of molecular oxygen. In the clinic, patients treated with PDT should be kept away 
from direct sunlight or strong indoor lighting to avoid skin phototoxicity. In our previous 
study, we demonstrated that the skin phototoxicity of meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin 
(m-THPC), a photosensitizer used in the clinic, can be significantly reduced after micellar 
encapsulation; however, no improvement in antitumor efficacy was observed. Thus, 
improved tumor targeting of the photosensitizer is necessary to prevent photodamage to the 
healthy tissue and to increase the effectiveness of the photosensitizers for fighting cancer. In 
this work, m-THPC was successfully incorporated into the folate-conjugated polymeric 
micelle, and the targeting ability and anti-tumor effects of the formulated photosensitizer 
were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that folate-conjugated 
m-THPC-loaded micelles with particle sizes around 100 nm were selectively uptaken by 
folate receptor-ovexpressed KB cells and their PDT had no significant adverse effects on the 
body weight of mice in vivo. Furthermore, after an extended delivery time, folate-conjugated 
m-THPC-loaded micelles had higher anti-tumor effects (tumor growth inhibition % = 92.11) 
through inhibition of cell proliferation and reduction of vessel density than free m-THPC. 
Thus, folate-conjugated m-THPC-loaded micelle could be used as a potential nanocarrier for 
targetable and PDT-mediated cancer therapy.

was then added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to react for one hour. The reaction was 
cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was removed until only 50 mL remained. The 
solvent mixture of n-hexane/ether (2:1, 900 mL) was added at 4C until a precipitate formed. 
The precipitate was washed three times with n-hexane/ether mixtures, and the solid was dried 
under vacuum to obtain Benzyl-PLA-OH. Next, the Benzyl-PLA-OH (50 g) and TEA (12 
mL) were dissolved in THF (300 mL) under N2 in an ice-water bath. Subsequently, the mesyl 
chloride (6.48 mL) mixed in THF (20 mL) was added to the PLA mixture under N2 and 
allowed to react for one hour. The solution was filtered through celite, and the solvent was 
removed until the mixture was dry. The white solid was recrystallized with cold methanol 
and dried under vacuum to obtain Benzyl-PLA-OMs. For polymerization, the 
Benzyl-PLA-OMs (10 g) was first dissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) under N2 at 100°C, and 
then 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (20.4 mL) was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred for 
17 hours. KOH (0.1 N) was added after the solution was cooled to room temperature. The 
solvent was removed, and the solid was redissolved with THF. The solution mixture was 
recrystallized with cold ether three times and dried under vacuum, and an NMR figure 
depicting Benzyl-PLA-PEOz was obtained. For folate conjugation, folic acid (0.245 g), 
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.172 g) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.102 g) were first 
dissolved in DMF (50 mL) and stirred for 2 hours at 35°C. The Benzyl-PLA-PEOz (5 g) was 
then added, and the reaction mixtures were stirred overnight. The solvent was removed under 
vacuum, and the solid was redissolved in DMSO. The solution was dialyzed (MWCO 3500) 
in DMSO for 2 days and then dialyzed in H2O for 2 days. After dialysis, the mixture was 
lyophilized to remove the solvent, and Benzyl-PLA-PEOz-folate was obtained. The ratio of 
folate conjugation was analyzed by 1H NMR using δ8.78 (1H, Folate) compared to δ7.33 (5H, 
benzyl group of PLA terminal).. This quantitative analysis revealed that a ratio of 12% folate 
conjugation to the PEOz-PLA was obtained. The average MW and polydispersity of 
PEOz-PLA were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, pump: SpectraSystem 
P100, TSP) with a refractive index detector (RefractoMonitor IV, TSP). The critical micelle 
concentration (CMC) of each copolymer was determined by a fluorescence technique with 
pyrene as a hydrophobic probe [28]. 
 
2.3 Preparation of m-THPC-loaded polymeric micelles 
Folate-conjugated PEOz-PLA (conjugation ratio: 12% of PEOz-PLA) and m-THPC were 
dissolved in a minimum volume of acetone and added drop-wise to vigorously stirred 
deionized water (1 mL) [29]. The organic solvent was completely evaporated at room 
temperature using a Rotor Evaporator (N-1000SW, EYELA, Japan). After the organic 
solvent was removed, the micelle solution was sonicated for 20 minutes using a sonicator 
(Ultrasonic Homogenizer Model XL 2007, Misonix, Inc., Farmingdale, New York, USA) at 
25oC [30]. The resultant solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter to remove 
unencapsulated drug aggregates. The folate-conjugated m-THPC incorporated polymeric 
micelles (folate-m-THPC-PM) were obtained after filtration. The procedure for preparing 
m-THPC-loaded polymeric micelles (m-THPC-PM) was similar to the protocol used to make 
folate-m-THPC-PM. The encapsulation efficiency and amount of m-THPC in the micelles 
was determined as described previously [19]. Particle size was measured using a Zetasizer 
Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). The absorption and fluorescence 
emission spectra of m-THPC-loaded micelles were measured using a UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer (U-3000, Hitachi, Japan) or a fluorescence spectrofluorometer (FP-6300, 
Jasco, Japan), respectively. 
 
2.4 Cell lines and culture conditions 
An oral epidermoid cell line overexpressing the folate receptor (KB cells, FR+) and folate 
receptor-negative HT-29 colorectal cancer cells (FR-) were chosen to evaluate the selectivity 
of folate-conjugated micelles. Cells were grown in MEM medium (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, 
MD, USA) containing 1x sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
(Gibco BRL) and 1 % antibiotics (antibiotic-antimycotic, Gibco BRL) at 37C under 5% 
CO2. 
the tissue sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody for 
30 min at room temperature. The avidin–biotin complexes were visualized with the 
3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) chromogen. Sections were also 
counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained sections were monitored at low power (40×) and 
counted at high power magnifications (400×). Cells that stained positively for PCNA or 
CD31 were counted at 400× magnification in at least 5 different fields. Images of the stained 
sections were acquired using a light microscope (BX 50, OLYMPUS) equipped with a digital 
camera (DP 20, OLYMPUS). The proportions (%) of PCNA or CD31 stained cells were 
quantified with Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). 
 
2.8 Biodistribution of m-THPC-PM and folate-m-THPC-PM 
The biodistribution of m-THPC-PM and folate-m-THPC-PM (n = 3 per group) was 
analyzed in female BALB/c nude mice bearing KB tumors as previously reported [34]. The 
agent was administered intravenously as a single dose of m-THPC (0.3 mg/kg). Mice were 
sacrificed by cervical dislocation 24 h after drug administration. Plasma, tumor, skin, heart, 
liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle and colon were collected from each mouse and snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then dissolved in a mixture of DMSO and 
methanol (v/v = 5/3) and incubated at 60oC under continuous shaking for at least 12 h. All 
samples were spun at 16,000 g in a centrifuge for 5 min and the supernatants were analyzed 
by spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-6300). The m-THPC tissue concentration was determined 
from a calibration curve using m-THPC/tumor homogenate standard solutions.  
 
2.9 Statistical Analysis 
All data are expressed as means ± standard deviation. Tumor volumes for each group 
measured at different time points are summarized as means and standard deviations. Group 
effects on tumor volume were tested using a linear mixed model with Bonfferroni correction 
and presented as the estimated marginal means (EM means) and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of tumor volume, with adjustment for time effects. Statistical 
significance was set at 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 15.0 software 
package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Preparation and characterization of m-THPC-loaded micelles 
To obtain a water-soluble micellar or folate-conjugated micellar m-THPC formulation, the 
PEOz-PLA copolymer was synthesized and characterized as described previously [35-37]. 
Contrary to the PEOz-PLA synthetic process, in which the PEOz-OH is first synthesized as 
an initiator of the ring-opening polymerization of D,L-lactide, when making folate-conjugated 
PEOz-PLA, the PLA must be synthesized first to allow further polymerization of 
2-ethyl-2-oxazoline and folate conjugation. The ratio of folate conjugation on the PEOz-PLA 
diblock copolymer was determined by comparing the integral peak area associated with the 
feature signals of folate (8.8 ppm, pyrazine unit) and benzyl-PLA (7.34 ppm, benzyl). The 
ratio of folate coupling was 12%. The molecular weights (Mw) of PEOz-PLA and 
folate-conjugated PEOz-PLA as determined by GPC were 10360 and 11900, and the 
polydispersity index values determined by GPC were 1.21 and 1.20, respectively (Table 1). 
The CMCs of the PEOz-PLA and the folate-conjugated PEOz-PLA diblock copolymer were 
measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer using pyrene as a hydrophobic probe. In the 
presence of micelles, pyrene is transferred from the aqueous environment to the non-polar 
region of the micelle’s interior core, which results in significant spectroscopic changes in this 
fluorophore. A red shift in the excitation spectrum of pyrene was observed when the 
copolymer concentration was increased, and the CMCs of the copolymers were estimated 
based on the relative excitation fluorescent intensity ratio of I337.5/I335.5. Folate-conjugated 
PEOz-PLA exhibited a low CMC (0.00068 wt %), similar to that of synthesized PEOz-PLA 
(0.0007 wt %), and thereby provides relative stability during systemic circulation (Table 1). 
  The m-THPC encapsulation was performed in parallel with micelle formation using the 
thin film method. Characteristics of the m-THPC-PM and folate-m-THPC-PM are 
preferentially accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus 
[41]. The m-THPC-PM was predicted to enter the endosome/lysosome compartments via the 
endocytic pathway [19] that may decrease the PDT efficacy in acidic environments [42]. 
Importantly, folate-conjugated micelles were predicted to be internalized via 
caveolae-mediated endocytosis [43, 44], allowing the photosensitizer to bypass the acidic 
microenvironment in the endosome/lysosome and retain its PDT efficacy.

3.3. Photodynamic therapy in vivo 
To demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in vivo, 30 animals were equally divided into six 
groups: control, PM, folate-PM, m-THPC-PDT, m-THPC-PM-PDT and 
folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT. PBS, free m-THPC, m-THPC-PM or folate-m-THPC-PM (0.3 mg 
m-THPC equivalents/kg) were intravenously injected into a mouse KB tumor model, 
followed by light treatment at 24 hours postinjection with a fluence of 15 J/cm2. Figure 2A 
shows the relative weight curves of nude mice without or with PDT treatments. The weight 
differences among the six groups were similar, and no apparent weight loss was observed 
during the experimental period.  
The antitumor efficacy of non-targeted or actively-targeted micellar-PDT was evaluated by 
measuring tumor growth rates. Figure 2B shows the regrowth curves of folate 
receptor-overexpressing KB tumors in all groups. For the three groups that animals treated 
with PBS, PM or folate-PM, tumor volumes continuously increased from day 0 to 24 
[PBS-control: from 109.0±15.3 mm3 to 1,237.0±141.2 mm3; PM: from 105.5±10.2 mm3 to 
1,159.9±130.1 mm3; folate-PM: from 102.6±14.9 mm3 to 1,113.7±118.6 mm3]. For the 
m-THPC-PDT, m-THPC-PM-PDT, and folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT groups, tumor volumes 
decreased from days 0 to 3 [m-THPC-PDT: from 107.7±12.2 to 61.7±14.9; 
mTHPC-PM-PDT: from 105.4±11.9 to 62.2±34.0; folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT: from 
109.4±12.3 to 16.4±2.1], remained stable from days 3 to 12 and then slowly increased from 
day 12 to day 24. After adjusting for time effects, no significant differences in tumor volume 
were observed between control, PM and folate-PM groups. Interestingly, tumor volumes in 
the folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT group were significantly smaller than those of the 
m-THPC-PDT and m-THPC-PM-PDT groups [EM means (95% CI): 88.31 (57.57, 119.06) 
mm3 vs. 186.64 (157.50, 215.79) mm3 and 190.38 (158.43, 222.33) mm3, P<0.001]. No 
significant difference in tumor volume was found between m-THPC-PDT and 
m-THPC-PM-PDT groups. This finding was consistent with our previous report that the 
antitumor effect of m-THPC-PDT cannot be improved by the use of micellar encapsulation 
[19]. Isolated tumors were observed after the mice from each group were sacrificed (Figure 
2B). The tumor sizes of the PDT treated groups (m-THPC-PDT, m-THPC-PM-PDT and 
folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT) were significantly smaller than those of the control groups 
(p<0.001, PM (TGI % = 6.23) and the folate-PM group (TGI % = 9.97). The smallest tumor 
the folate receptor overexpressing animal model, the intratumoral m-THPC concentration 
was significantly increased when folate-conjugated micelles were used as carriers, resulting 
in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. The effects of m-THPC-based PDT (free or micellar 
photosensitizers) on tumor were considered largely mediated by vascular damage. However, 
the effects of folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT on the tumor may not only be due to vascular damage 
but also could be caused by direct tumor photodamage from enhanced m-THPC 
accumulation at the tumor site via folate-folate receptor binding. Therefore, the tumor tissue 
damage caused by folate-m-THPC-PM may be different from that observed with m-THPC 
alone.

Our previous report demonstrated that free m-THPC causes serious skin photosensitivity 
but that micellar encapsulation of the drug can significantly reduce this skin damage 48 h 
postinjection [19]. Folate conjugation of the micellar formulation induced similarly reduced 
skin photosensitivity as the non-conjugated m-THPC-PM (data not shown). In addition, the 
actively-targeted, micelle-mediated PDT significantly inhibited tumor regrowth compared to 
PDT with the unconjugated micellar photosensitizer. This could potentially offer a significant 
clinical advantage over free m-THPC or micellar-m-THPC treatment. 
 
3.5. Effect of PDT treatments on cellular proliferation in the tumor environment  
To evaluate the effects of m-THPC-mediated PDT on the folate receptor-overexpressing 
tumor region, tumor specimens from mice sacrificed on day 24 were fixed, embedded, 
sectioned and stained. As shown in Figure 4, examination of H&E-stained tissue sections 
demonstrated differences in tissue morphology between the treatment groups: prominent 
necrosis was clearly apparent in the m-THPC-PDT (Figure 4D), m-THPC-PM-PDT and 
folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT groups (Figures 4E and 4F). To evaluate cell proliferation, 
expression of PCNA, a nuclear protein synthesized in the late G1 and S phases of the cell 
cycle, was assessed as a proliferation maker for immunohistochemical analysis. As shown in 
Figure 5, mice treated with PM or folate-PM without irradiation displayed higher proportions 
of PCNA-positive cells (96±1%, Figure 5B; 96±2%, Figure 5C, respectively), similar to the 
control group (95±2%, Figure 5A). In contrast, tumors from mice treated with m-THPC-PDT 
or m-THPC-PM-PDT exhibited significantly decreased cell proliferation as detected by 
PCNA expression (33±4%, Figure 5D; 33±2%, Figure 5E, respectively) compared with the 
non-PDT-treated groups. Notably, the folate-m-THPC-PM-PDT group presented a 
significantly lower rate of cell proliferation (8±2%, Figure 5F) compared to the other groups. 
Therefore, actively-targeted, micelle-based m-THPC-PDT can efficiently reduce cell 
proliferation in a KB xenograft model. The quantification of PCNA staining is shown in 
Figure 5G.  
could be utilized for cancer therapy alone or in combination with angiogenesis inhibitors, 
modulators of the immune system or chemotherapeutic agents [51-53].

4. Conclusions 
In our previous study, the primary clinical side effect of PDT, skin photosensitivity, was 
shown to be reduced by the use of micellar photosensitizers. However, no significant 
increase in antitumor efficacy was observed with the micellar photosensitizer compared to 
the conventional photosensitizer. In this study, we found that a folate-conjugated micellar 
photosensitizer can be selectively internalized into cancer cells that overexpress the folate 
receptor. This formulation significantly suppressed tumor growth through inhibition of cell 
proliferation and reduction of vessel density. Therefore, these findings suggest that this 
targetable micellar photosensitizer represents a potential delivery system for photodynamic 
therapy in a clinical setting.
