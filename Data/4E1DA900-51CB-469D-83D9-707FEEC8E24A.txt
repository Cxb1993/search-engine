2are often assumed as continuous variables.
However, commercially available capacitors are
discrete. Selecting integer capacitor sizes closest to
the optimal values found by the continuous
variable approach may not guarantee an optimal
solution [8].
In the past, capacitors were often assumed as
continuous variables in which cost is proportionate
to the capacitor size. However, commercially
available capacitors have discrete sizes. Thus,
selecting integer capacitor sizes closet to the
optimal values found by the continuous variable
approach may not be guaranteed an optimal
solution. Therefore, discrete capacitors will be
considered in this study. For a J -bus system, if
the number of available capacitor sizes is L , then
there is a total of  JL 1 alternatives for capacitor
placement. The  JL 1 will become a very large
number even for a large-scale distribution system.
Accordingly, the huge number of combinations in
the solution space makes the solution searching
process become a heavy burden.
Hybrid differential evolution (HDE) [9-10] is
a stochastic search and optimization method. The
fittest of an offspring competes one-to-one with
that of the corresponding parent, which is different
from the other evolutionary algorithms (EAs). This
one-to-one competition gives rise to a faster
convergence rate. However, this faster convergence
also leads to a higher probability of obtaining a
local optimum because the diversity of the
population descends faster during the solution
process. To overcome this drawback, the migrating
operator and accelerated operator are employed to
act as trade-off operators for the diversity of
population and the convergence property in HDE.
Migrating operator maintains the diversity of
population, which guarantees a high probability of
obtaining the global optimum. And, accelerated
operator is used to accelerate convergence.
However, a fixed scaling factor is used in the HDE.
Using a smaller scaling factor, the HDE becomes
increasingly robust. However, much computational
time should be expanded to evaluate the objective
function. The HDE with a larger scaling factor
generally falls into local solutions or
misconvergence. Lin et al. [11] used a random
number that its value is between zero and one as a
scaling factor. However, a random scaling factor
could not guarantee the fast convergence.
In this study, a multiple variable scaling
hybrid differential evolution (M-VSHDE) for
solving the optimal capacitor placement of
distribution systems is proposed. With some
assumptions, the hybrid differential evolution
(HDE) can be shown as a method using pN
parallel processors of the two membered evolution
strategy ((1+1)-ES), where pN is the number of
individuals in the solution space. So, the 1/5
success rule of evolution strategies (ESs) [12-13] is
used in the M-VSHDE to adjust the scaling factor
to accelerate searching out the global solution. In
the HDE, only one fixed scaling factor is used
during the solution process. However, a fixed
scaling factor is very difficultly to select in HDE
and could not guarantee the fast convergence.
Different from the HDE, pN scaling factors based
on the 1/5 success rule of evolution strategies (ESs)
is used in the M-VSHDE method to accelerate
searching out the global solution. That is, every
individual has the corresponding scaling factor.
According to the convergence property of every
individual, the corresponding scaling factor is
adjusted based on the 1/5 success rule of the ESs to
accelerate searching out the global solution.
The next section of this paper formulates the
optimal capacitor placement of distribution
systems and discusses power flow computation.
Section 3 describes the multiple variable scaling
hybrid differential evolution method. The variable
scaling factor based on the 1/5 success rule of ESs
is used in the M-VSHDE to overcome the
drawback of the fixed and random scaling factor
used in the HDE. In section 4, various-scale
application systems including 9-bus, 33-bus and
132-bus contrast the solution obtained using the
proposed M-VSHDE method with the HDE, and

3. Multiple variable scaling hybrid
differential evolution
The main idea of the multiple variable scaling
hybrid differential evolution (M-VSHDE) is to use
the variable scaling factor based on the 1/5 success
rule of the evolution strategies (ESs) [12-13] to
overcome the drawback of the fixed and random
scaling factor used in the HDE. The 1/5 success
rule emerged as a conclusion of the process of
optimizing convergence rate of two functions (the
so-called corridor mode and sphere model
[12-13,16]). The rule of updating scaling factor is
as follows:

Where tip is the frequency of successful mutations
measured of the i-th individual. The successful
mutation of the i-th individual defines the fitness
value of the i-th individual is better than that of its
parent. The initial value of the scaling factor, iF , is
set to 1.2 [17-18]. The factors of 82.0dc and
82.0/1jc [12-13] are used for adjustment, which
should be taken place for every q iterations.
When the migration operator is performed, the
value of scaling factor is defined as follows.
pi Niitermax
iter
F ,,1,1  (12)
Where iter and itermax are the number of current
iteration and the maximum iteration, respectively.
And, the scaling factor can be reset as (12) when
the scaling factor is too small to find better
solution in the solution process.
Formally, the multiple variable scaling hybrid
differential evolution algorithm is briefly described
in the following
Step 1. Initialization
Input system data and generate the initial
population. The initial population is chosen
randomly and would attempt to cover the entire
parameter space uniformly. The uniform
probability distribution for all random variables as
follows is assumed
piiiii NiZZroundZZ ,...,1)),(( min,max,min,
0   (13)
Where  1,0i is a random number, and )(bround
represents the nearest integer to the real number b .
The initial process can produce pN individuals of
0
iZ randomly.
Step 2. Mutation operation
The essential ingredient in the mutation
operation is the difference vector. Each individual
pair in a population at the G-th generation defines
a difference vector jkD as
G
k
G
jjk ZZD  (14)
The mutation process at the G-th generation begins
by randomly selecting either two or four
population individuals GjZ , GkZ , GlZ and GmZ for
any j , k , l and m . These four individuals are
then combined to form a difference vector jklmD
as

the present individual in the mutation process by

Where scaling factor, iF , is a constant. And, j , k ,
l and m are randomly selected.
The perturbed individual in (16) is essentially
a noisy replica of GpZ . Herein, the parent individual
G
pZ depends on the circumstance in which the type
of the mutation operations is employed.
Step 3. Crossover operation
6solve the optimal capacitor placement problems.
The SA solver recommended some setting factors
for a user. For comparison, SA package is rewritten
using Matlab software.
Example 1: The application example [14-15] is a
23-kV, 9-section feeder system. Details of the
feeder and the load characteristics are given in
Table 1. The equivalent annual cost per unit of
power loss, pK , is selected to be $ 168 )/( yearkW 
and the limits on the bus voltages are
..90.0min upV  (23)
..10.1max upV  (24)
The impedance for the 9 sections of the feeder and
the load data for the feeder are listed in Table. 1.
Available capacitor sizes with the corresponding
annual costs are listed in Table 2. Two cases are
investigated.
Case 1: It is restricted that only 3 locations
(buses 4, 5, and 9) are available for placement of
capacitors [8]. The setting factors used in
M-VSHDE to solve this case are as follows. The
population size, pN , is set to 5. The maximum
generation is 500. The crossover factor, rC , is set
to 0.5. The second mutation operator is used. Two
tolerances,  and 1 , used in the migrating
operation are set to 0 and 0.1, respectively. These

initial-setting factors for the HDE method are the
same as that for the M-VSHDE, except that the
HDE use a fixed scaling factor that is set to 0.3.
The SA is also applied to solve this problem. To
verify the performance of the proposed algorithm,
this case was repeatedly solved one hundred times.
The best and the worst values among the best
solutions of these one hundred runs are listed in
Table 3. The average value and standard deviation
(STD) for the best solutions of these one hundred
runs, and the average CPU time are also shown in
this table. A smaller standard deviation implies that
most the best solutions are close to the average.
The best solutions for these one hundred runs
obtained by the M-VSHDE method are compared
with the best objective function value obtained by
the HDE, and SA methods. The HDE and SA got
premature convergence so that their standard

the performance of the proposed M-VSHDE
method is better than the other methods. Table 5
shows the total power loss before and after
compensation for these two systems. From Table 5,
it can be seen that the M-VSHDE has smaller total
power loss than the HDE, and SA methods.
5. Conclusion
Several heuristic methods including
M-VSHDE, HDE, and SA for solving the capacitor
placement problems in large-scale distribution
systems had been described. The proposed
M-VSHDE method utilized the 1/5 success rule of
evolution strategies (ESs) to adjust the scaling
factor to overcome the drawback of the fixed and
random scaling factor used in the HDE to
accelerate searching out the global solution. The
standard deviation (STD) for the best solution of
these one hundred runs obtained by the M-VSHDE
is less than those of the HDE, and SA methods.
This implies that most the best solutions obtained
by the M-VSHDE are close to the average.
Various-scale application systems are investigated.

The computational results of example 1 showed
that the solution obtained by the proposed method
is better than those obtained by the hybrid
differential evolution (HDE), and simulated
annealing (SA). From example 2, it is observed
that the M-VSHDE method is especially suitable
for application to large-scale systems.
