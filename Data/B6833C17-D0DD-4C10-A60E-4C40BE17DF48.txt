英文摘要 
In the project, we adopt the multi-hop scheduling algorithms for the all-to-all broadcast 
problems in broadcast star Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks with 
N nodes. Moreover, we assume the multi-hop ρ is the maximum hop distance for packet 
transmissions to decrease the effect of optical and electronic transformations. The objective 
of our problem is to minimize the number of tunable wavelengths of each transmitter to 
reduce the cost of nodes.  For packet transmissions, we use tunable wavelengths of 
transmitters to create a logical ring, and then adopt to minimize the number of logical rings to 
decide the number of tunable wavelengths of each transmitters. We transfer our problem to 
the round robin tournament problem with ⎡(N-1)/ ρ⎤ teams and propose two algorithms to 
construct at most 4⎡(N-1)/ ρ⎤ logical rings for the problem.

2 Main Strategy
Our problem deﬁnes as follows:
Assume the number of nodes be N and each node with multi-hop ρ. Choose γ rings such
that each node can transmit packets to all other nodes on these rings.
From now on, we use the notation N to be the number of nodes in the network and assign
0, 1, 2, ..., (N − 1) to those nodes. In addition, we use the notation ρ to be the number of
each node’s multi-hop.
Definition 1. Let x = (N−1)/ρ and divide {0, 1, 2, ..., N−1} into x groups {g1, g2, ..., gx}
with order satisfying:
(i) gi = ((i− 1)ρ+ 0, (i− 1)ρ+ 1, (i− 1)ρ+ 2, ..., (iρ− 1), for all i ∈ {1, 2, ..., x− 1}.
gx = ((x− 1)ρ + 0, (x− 1)ρ + 1, ..., N − 1).
(ii) All elements of gi is with order for all i ∈ {1, 2, .., x}.
With the Deﬁnition 1, we partition N nodes into x groups easily. Let |gi| be the
number of elements of gi. Furthermore, we use the notation gi to be (ik, ik−1, ..., i2, i1) where
gi = (i1, i2, ..., ik).
such that each group g appears in the front of all other groups in these rings, then we can
solve our problem.
3 Algorithms from The Round Robin Tournament
The round robin tournament is a well known problem for edge coloring and can provides
the scheduling such that each term can play with all other terms in limited rounds. If the
number of teams, x, is even in the round robin tournament, then the number of rounds is
(x−1). And if the number of teams, x, is odd, then the number of rounds is x. For example
in Table 1, there are six terms and ﬁve rounds in which these games are scheduled. Through
the ﬁve rounds, each term can play with all other ﬁve terms. Now if we replace the word
”term” to the word ”group” and the word ”round” to the word ”ring”, then the statement
is the following ”through these rings, each group can paly with all other groups”. This is
similar to the goal of our problem ”choosing the rings such that any group g appears in the
front of all other groups in these rings”. We use Deﬁnition 2 and 3 to represent all rounds
of the round robin tournament.
Table 1: Example of the round robin tournament with six teams
Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4 Round 5
1− 4 (g1, g4) 1− 2 (g1, g2) 1− 3 (g1, g3) 1− 6 (g1, g6) 1− 5 (g1, g5)
2− 5 (g2, g5) 3− 4 (g3, g4) 2− 6 (g2, g6) 3− 5 (g3, g5) 4− 6 (g4, g6)
3− 6 (g3, g6) 5− 6 (g5, g6) 4− 5 (g4, g5) 2− 4 (g2, g4) 2− 3 (g2, g3)
Definition 2. Assume the number of terms be x and x be even. Then there are (x − 1)
rounds and each round i, Ri, has {(gi1 , gi2), (gi3 , gi4), ..., (gi(x−1) , gix)} games where i1 < i3 <
... < i(x−1) and (i1, i2, ..., ix) be one permutation of (1, 2, ..., x)). Furthermore, Let {Ri} be
the set of all rounds.
Definition 3. Assume the number of terms be x and x be odd. Then there are x rounds
and each round i, Ri, has {gi1 , (gi2 , gi3), ..., (gix−1 , gix)} games where i2 < i4 < ... < i(x−1)
Step 1 Establishing the round robin tournament with x groups and the number of rounds
is (x− 1) and the set of all rounds is {Ri} where 1 ≤ i ≤ (x− 1)
Step 2 Choosing all rings {ri} as our rings and the inverse of these rings {ri}. The total
number of rings is 2(x− 1)
Step 3 Choosing another 2(x− 1) rings in Step 2 by replacing all groups gi to groups gi
where 1 ≤ i ≤ x
Algorithm 2 (x is odd)
Step 1 Establishing the round robin tournament with x groups and the number of rounds
is x and the set of all rounds is {Ri} where 1 ≤ i ≤ x
Step 2 Choosing all rings {ri} as our rings and the inverse of these rings {ri}. The total
number of rings is 2x.
Step 3 Choosing another 2x rings in Step 2 by replacing all groups gi to groups gi where
1 ≤ i ≤ x
When x is even, we choose the 2(x − 1) rings in Step 2 and the 2(x − 1) rings in Step
3. We attain γ = 2(x − 1) + 2(x − 1)— = 4(x − 1). Therefore, the 4(x − 1) rings is the
solution. Similarly, our number of rings is 4x when x is odd.
Assume the number of nodes N be 25 and the number of multi-hop ρ be 4. Then
x = (25 − 1)/4 = 6 and g1, ..., g6 deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1. So there are six groups in the
round robin tournament and the set of all rounds {Ri} is listed in Table 1. We are easy to get
{ri} = { (g1, g4, g2, g5, g3, g6), (g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6), (g1, g3, g2, g6, g4, g5), (g1, g6, g3, g5, g2, g4),
(g1, g5, g4, g6, g2, g3)}. Similarly, we can get {ri} and the set of rings in Step 3. These 20
rings are our solution.
