One of the major challenges in molecular biology is to understand the precise mechanism 
by which gene expression is regulated. Reconstruction of transcription networks is essential 
to modeling this mechanism. In this report, we describe a novel approach for building 
transcription networks from transcription modules by combining expression profile 
correlations with probabilistic element assessment. To demonstrate its performance, we 
systematically tested it on 27 transcription modules and reconstructed the transcription 
network for 6 transcription factors and 15 genes involved in the yeast cell cycle. The 
experimental results show that our combinatorial approach can better filter false positives to 
increase the selectivity in prediction of target genes. The regulatory control relationships 
described by the network reconstructed also mostly agree with those in earlier studies. 
 
Introduction 
 
Each cell is the product of specific gene expression programs specified by genomic 
sequences. These programs involve regulated transcription of thousands of genes (Lee, et al., 
2002). The regulation of gene expression is very complex and often accomplished through the 
coordinated actions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) (Yuh et al., 1998; Halfon, et al., 
2000; Fickett, et al., 2000). One way to understand the potential pathways that can be used by 
a cell to regulate global gene expression programs is to model the network of regulator-gene 
interactions.  
As the advent of microarray technology, an enormous amount of gene-expression data 
from a variety of biological analyses has been generated (Spellman, et al., 1998; DeRisi, et al., 
1997; Alon, et al., 1999). High-throughput and large-scale expression profiling is considered 
one of the most promising techniques for reconstructing genetic networks. The experimental 
results enable the global studies of gene regulation (van Berkum and Holstege, 2001). 
Inference of gene-expression regulatory mechanisms is rapidly becoming a major research 
topic in bioinformatics.  
There has been much work on genetic regulatory networks, applying different network 
representations and inference strategies. For example, some is focused on conditional 
probability distribution in Bayesian networks, some derives Boolean functions for Boolean 
networks, and some is based on differential equations (D’haeseleer, et al., 2000; Akutsu, et al., 
2000; Hartemink, et al., 2001; Chen, et al., 1999). More recent studies address the importance 
and build the transcription module. They include: (1) the transcription factor binding sites, (2) 
the expression profile similarity of potential target genes and (3) the correlation between the 
expression profile of the gene(s) that produces the factor and that of the target genes the factor 
regulates. By the synergy of various kinds of knowledge, we expect to better characterize the 
nature of transcriptional regulation mechanism, so as to improve the prediction of 
cis-regulatory sequences and ensure the quality of transcription modules. 
We encode TF binding sites in the standard IUPAC/IUB code. For a particular 
transcription factor, we match its binding sites against the upstream region of entire genome. 
This provides the preliminary candidate cis-regulatory sequences. To filter spurious false 
positives from the pattern-based search, we develop a new metric that combines the 
probabilistic element assessment (PEA) with the p-value of F-test (PF) on regression. The 
PEA is a ranking of potential sites according to sequence similarity in the upstream regions of 
genes with similar expression profiles (Fujibuchi, et al., 2001). It evaluates the probability of 
element conservation in expression clusters based on the idea that a sequence pattern is a 
regulatory element (i.e. TF binding site) if observed more often than expected in a gene 
expression cluster. Assuming a binomial distribution, the PEA value is defined as follows: 
1)1()( −
=
−⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛=≥ ∑ NiN
xi
i
N mmxkP  
where P is the probability of finding x or more genes whose upstream contains a specific 
regulatory element by chance, m is the expected probability of element occurrence and N is 
the total number of genes in the cluster. The value of m can be estimated from the fraction of 
genome that has the element. The lower the PEA is, the more significant the element is.  
Besides applying PEA to measure the significance of a regulatory element with the 
correlation among the genes in an expression cluster co-regulated by a particular TF, we also 
try to model the association between the gene(s) that produces the TF and the TF’s target 
genes. We perform a linear regression on their expression profiles, followed by an F-test, to 
evaluate the strength of the relationship. For a transcription factor, say F, produced by the 
genes, x1, x2,…, xp (if F is a complex), we define the linear regression model as the following: 
Yi ≈Yi
^ =α + β1x1,i + β2x2,i + ...+ β p xp,i 
where Yi is the expression data of gene Y in the ith transcript profile experiment and Yi
^
 is the 
corresponding estimated value of Yi. We use as the 
estimating formula, where xj,i is the expression data of gene xj in the ith transcript profile 
experiment, α is the constant, and β1…βp are the regression coefficients. Our first step is to 
find the best fit of Yi with 
Yi
^ =α + β1x1,i + β2x2,i + ...+ β p x p,i
Yi
^
 by determining α and β1…βp, using the least square method, 
and then to verify whether all the genes, x1, x2,…, xp, taken together, significantly explain the 
observed Yi. To test the significance, we form the following hypotheses: 
H0: β1 = β2 = … = βp = 0    null hypothesis: Yi does not depend on the xi’s 
H1: at least one βi  ≠ 0     alternative hypothesis: Yi depends on at least one of the xi’s 
We perform an F-test on the regression as a whole. If the null hypothesis is true, the ratio: 
F =
(Yi

has an F distribution with p numerator degrees of freedom and n-p-1 denominator degrees of 
freedom.  If the null hypothesis is false, then the F ratio tends to be larger than it is when the 
null hypothesis is true. We define PF = prob(Fp,n− p−1 > F) , where Fp,n-p-1 is the F value 
corresponding to a significance level. Therefore, if PF (p-value of F-test) is significantly 
small, we reject H0, and conclude that Yi is associated with at least one of the xi’s. In our

Results 
Identification of Transcription Modules 
 
As the accuracy of a transcription network depends on the correctness of its transcription 
modules, before verifying our method can reconstruct meaningful transcription networks, we 
demonstrate its performance of building significant transcription modules.  
A transcription module is composed of a particular transcription factor and its target 
genes. Although several techniques have been proposed to locate the target genes of a 
transcription factor, none of them was systematically evaluated to determine if known 
regulatory elements were better identified than by naïve searches (Quandt, et al., 1995; 
Lavorgna, et al., 1999; Zhang, 1999; Wolfsberg, et al., 1999). , To justify the feasibility of our 
new approach, we compared our method with PROSPECT (Fujibuchi, et al., 2001), which 
had been systematically evaluated. Like PROSPECT, we selected SCPD as the dataset for 
evaluation. We merged the information of recognition sites from SCPD (Zhu and Zhang, 
1999) and TRANSFAC (Wingender, et al., 1996). After removing the sites without sensible 
consensus and disregarding the regulators for which the gene(s) producing them is unknown, 
we selected 27 regulatory elements in our studies. We also used the same metric as in 
PROSPECT, the selectivity ratio, for comparison. For a particular method, the selectivity is 
the fraction of correctly predicted elements out of all elements predicted, and the selectivity 
ratio is defined as the ratio of its selectivity to that of a naïve pattern match method. In 
addition to selectivity, sensitivity is another important evaluation criterion. Despite the lack of 
full knowledge of true target genes, we simply define sensitivity as the fraction of correctly 
predicted elements out of all elements annotated in SCPD, assuming SCPD is complete.  
One important hypothesis behind our method is that there may exist potential 
relationships between the gene(s) producing a transcription factor and those regulated by this 
particular factor. Our experiments justified the hypothesis by showing that the target genes 
could be predicted by exploring the relationships through regression analysis. A lower PF 
value of the regression analysis between a transcription factor and genes suggests a stronger 
relationship between the transcription factor and these genes. To examine the effect of PF 
values on the selectivity ratio, we varied the PF threshold when testing the 27 elements. The 
results showed that for 16 elements, the selectivity ratio increased up to two or higher along 
the decrease of PF threshold. These 16 elements are ACE2, BAS1, BAS2, GCN4, GCR1, 
HAP1, HSTF, LEU3, MIG1, PDR3, PUT3, RAP1, REB1, SBF, SFF and STE12. The 
selectivity ratio fluctuated between one and two for nine elements, ABF1, ADR1, GAL4, 
MATα1, MATα2, MCM1, MBF, PHO4 and repressor of CAR1. Only for SWI5 and TBP did 
the decrease of PF threshold make the selectivity ratio worse instead. We show some of the 
results in Figure 4. Our empirical studies showed that when PF=0.03 and PEA=0.4, 
regression analysis and PROSPECT have the best overall performance respectively over the 
27 elements. We compared their results with those of naïve pattern searches. The results are 
summarized in Table 2. For selectivity ratio, regression analysis outperformed PROSPECT in 
16 elements but lost in 11 elements; as for sensitivity, PROSPECT did better in 14 elements 
and tied in four elements. The experimental results suggest that there indeed exists the 
association between some transcription factors and the target genes, and this relationship can 
be characterized by regression analysis.  
Since neither of regression analysis and PROSPECT outperformed the other in the 
prediction of all the 27 elements, we combined both approaches to benefit from the synergy. 
We consider a gene as a target gene of a particular transcription factor only if its PEA value 
and PF value are both smaller than some significance thresholds. We use both PEA and PF if 
available as the criteria to filter out false positives. To verify the performance of the 
combinatorial approach, we compared the performance of applying PEA or PF alone with that

between a TF and its target genes. PDR3 regulates YBL005W, YDL011W and YDR406W, 
each of which contains the binding site TCCGYGGA upstream of the gene. The similarity of 
their mRNA levels leads to a low PEA value and suggests that the genes are co-regulated via 
PDR3. The correlation between PDR3 and its target genes is reflected by the relationship 
between YBL005W’s mRNA level (which produces PDR3) and those of YDL011W and 
YDR406W. The relationship can be modeled by regression analysis and its significance is

 of the increase in predictive accuracy, the 
approximation of 3D structures with only a 
3-letter alphabet is apparently too crude for the 
more refined 3D reconstruction [9-13]. Various 
more complex structural alphabets have been 
developed by taking into account the 
heterogeneity of backbone protein structures 
through sets of small protein fragments frequently 
observed in different protein structure databases 
[14-21]. Unlike most other works, we developed a 
multi-strategy method for structural alphabet 
design, which combined self-organizing maps, 
minimum spanning tree algorithm and k-means 
algorithm [22]. The performance of our alphabet 
was demonstrated by the competitive accuracy in 
all-alpha protein search within SCOP using the 
standard 1D sequence alignment tool, FASTA 
[23].  
In this paper, we introduced an improved 
version of our alphabet design pipeline, to which 
we added a substitution matrix self-trainer. The 
substitution matrix used in aligning proteins 
represented by structural alphabets affects the 
accuracy of alignment. In our earlier work, we 
applied the identity matrix in the alignment [22]. 
Though the preliminary results successfully 
demonstrated the feasibility of our alphabet, yet a 
more appropriate matrix will further improve its 
applicability. The substitution matrix is a crucial 
factor in the successful application of 1D sequence 
alignment tools to search for similar 3D structures. 
We thus developed an automatic matrix training 
framework that can generate appropriate 
substitution matrices for new alphabets when 
applied in standard 1D sequence alignment 
methods, e.g. FASTA. Based on the alphabet we 
constructed, we can transform proteins into 1D 
structural alphabet representations. To identify 
protein local structure features, we applied the 
motif-finding tool MEME [24] to detect the 
common motifs. We tested two protein families in 
SCOP, TIM and EGF. The results showed our 
method successfully recovered their structure 
domains.  
 
Materials and Methods 
  
The simplest substitution matrix to use is the 
identity matrix, but it ignores possible acceptable 
alphabet letter substitutions, which significantly 
limits its applicability. Some authors applied 
HMM approach to define the matrix [25], while 
others adopted a similar approach in the 
development of BLOSUM matrices [26,27]. Most 
of these approaches to constructing substitution 
matrices required the alignments of known 
proteins [27-29]. As the alignments may be 
unavailable or even questionable, we took a 
self-training strategy to build a substitution matrix 
for our new structural alphabet. This training 
framework is a flexible and modular design, and it 
does not rely on any pre-alignment of protein 
sequences or structures. This matrix training 
procedure can be applied regardless of how the 
alphabet is derived. Different training data or 
alignment tools available can be incorporated in 
this framework to generate appropriate matrices 
under various circumstances.  
There are three components in the matrix 
training framework, an alignment tool with a 
substitution matrix, training data, and a matrix 
trainer. We used FASTA as the alignment tool, 
and the non-redundant proteins in SCOP1.69 with 
sequence similarity less than 40%, excluding the 
families of size smaller than 5 proteins, as the 
training dataset. We started by using the identity 
matrix as the initial substitution matrix where the 
score is 1 for a match, 0 for a mismatch. Each 
protein in the training dataset was iteratively used 
as a query for FASTA to search the rest of the 
dataset for similar proteins. If a protein returned 
by FASTA belonged to the same family as the 
query, we considered the case as a positive hit; 
otherwise, a negative hit. Those proteins not 
returned by FASTA but in the same family as the 
query were considered as misses. For all positive 
hits and misses, we gathered their alignments with 
the query produced by FASTA. Based on the 
alignments, we computed the log-odd ratios 
defined in the same way as in the BLOSUM 
matrices [28] to build the positive matrix. 
Similarly, with the alignments of negative hits, we 
constructed the negative matrix.  The matrix 
trainer updated the current substitution matrix S(t) 
to S(t+1) as the following.

The average positive hit rate converged at 0.9153 with the 
learning rate set 0.5. 
 
To demonstrate the ability of our structural 
alphabet to describe protein local structure 
features, we used MEME [24] to detect common 
motifs in the top 100 hits found by our alignment 
tool. These motifs could be well mapped to the 
eight β/α barrel strands of TIM barrel domains. 
Figure 4(a) showed the structure of archaeon 
pyrococcus woesei  (PDB 1hg3a). In Figure 4(b), 
we highlighted the identified motif in PDB 1hg3a, 
and Figure 4(c) illustrated the motif structure. The 
structural alphabet letter sequence of this motif 
and the corresponding amino acids were shown in 
Figure 4(d). In addition to TIM barrel structures, 
we also used the EGF/EGF-like domain as another 
study case. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
domains are extracellular protein modules 
typically described by 30-40 amino acids 
primarily stabilized by three disulfide bonds. 
Compared with TIM barrel structures, EGF are 
much smaller domains. We used it to evaluate 
how well a structural alphabet could define the 3D 
structures of small proteins. Many proteins contain 
the regions of homology to EGF, and the cysteine 
residues at similar positions. The homologies and 
available functional data suggest that these 
domains share some common functional features. 
If we number the cysteine residues as Cys1 to 
Cys6, where Cys1 is the closest to the N-terminus, 
the regularity of cysteine spacing defines three 
regions, A, B and C. Based on the conservation in 
sequence and length of these regions, the 
homologies have been classified into three 
different categories [33]. We described the 227 
proteins in the EGF-type module family of SCOP 
1.69 in our alphabet, Yang & Tung’s [27] and de 
Brevern et al.’s [15,26,31], respectively. We then 
used MEME to identify the common motifs 
corresponding to the sub-domains, A, B and C. 
According to InterPro [34], 24 of these proteins 
were exclusively of EGF Type-1, 74 were of 
EGF-like Type-2, and 117 belonged to EGF-like 
Type-3 only. We classified the remaining 12 
proteins as Others.

One of the major challenges in molecular biology is to understand the precise mechanism 
by which gene expression is regulated. Reconstruction of transcription networks is essential 
to modeling this mechanism. In this report, we describe a novel approach for building 
transcription networks from transcription modules by combining expression profile 
correlations with probabilistic element assessment. To demonstrate its performance, we 
systematically tested it on 27 transcription modules and reconstructed the transcription 
network for 6 transcription factors and 15 genes involved in the yeast cell cycle. The 
experimental results show that our combinatorial approach can better filter false positives to 
increase the selectivity in prediction of target genes. The regulatory control relationships 
described by the network reconstructed also mostly agree with those in earlier studies. 
 
Introduction 
 
Each cell is the product of specific gene expression programs specified by genomic 
sequences. These programs involve regulated transcription of thousands of genes (Lee, et al., 
2002). The regulation of gene expression is very complex and often accomplished through the 
coordinated actions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) (Yuh et al., 1998; Halfon, et al., 
2000; Fickett, et al., 2000). One way to understand the potential pathways that can be used by 
a cell to regulate global gene expression programs is to model the network of regulator-gene 
interactions.  
As the advent of microarray technology, an enormous amount of gene-expression data 
from a variety of biological analyses has been generated (Spellman, et al., 1998; DeRisi, et al., 
1997; Alon, et al., 1999). High-throughput and large-scale expression profiling is considered 
one of the most promising techniques for reconstructing genetic networks. The experimental 
results enable the global studies of gene regulation (van Berkum and Holstege, 2001). 
Inference of gene-expression regulatory mechanisms is rapidly becoming a major research 
topic in bioinformatics.  
There has been much work on genetic regulatory networks, applying different network 
representations and inference strategies. For example, some is focused on conditional 
probability distribution in Bayesian networks, some derives Boolean functions for Boolean 
networks, and some is based on differential equations (D’haeseleer, et al., 2000; Akutsu, et al., 
2000; Hartemink, et al., 2001; Chen, et al., 1999). More recent studies address the importance 
and build the transcription module. They include: (1) the transcription factor binding sites, (2) 
the expression profile similarity of potential target genes and (3) the correlation between the 
expression profile of the gene(s) that produces the factor and that of the target genes the factor 
regulates. By the synergy of various kinds of knowledge, we expect to better characterize the 
nature of transcriptional regulation mechanism, so as to improve the prediction of 
cis-regulatory sequences and ensure the quality of transcription modules. 
We encode TF binding sites in the standard IUPAC/IUB code. For a particular 
transcription factor, we match its binding sites against the upstream region of entire genome. 
This provides the preliminary candidate cis-regulatory sequences. To filter spurious false 
positives from the pattern-based search, we develop a new metric that combines the 
probabilistic element assessment (PEA) with the p-value of F-test (PF) on regression. The 
PEA is a ranking of potential sites according to sequence similarity in the upstream regions of 
genes with similar expression profiles (Fujibuchi, et al., 2001). It evaluates the probability of 
element conservation in expression clusters based on the idea that a sequence pattern is a 
regulatory element (i.e. TF binding site) if observed more often than expected in a gene 
expression cluster. Assuming a binomial distribution, the PEA value is defined as follows: 
1)1()( −
=
−⎟⎠
⎞⎜⎝
⎛=≥ ∑ NiN
xi
i
N mmxkP  
where P is the probability of finding x or more genes whose upstream contains a specific 
regulatory element by chance, m is the expected probability of element occurrence and N is 
the total number of genes in the cluster. The value of m can be estimated from the fraction of 
genome that has the element. The lower the PEA is, the more significant the element is.  
Besides applying PEA to measure the significance of a regulatory element with the 
correlation among the genes in an expression cluster co-regulated by a particular TF, we also 
try to model the association between the gene(s) that produces the TF and the TF’s target 
genes. We perform a linear regression on their expression profiles, followed by an F-test, to 
evaluate the strength of the relationship. For a transcription factor, say F, produced by the 
genes, x1, x2,…, xp (if F is a complex), we define the linear regression model as the following: 
Yi ≈Yi
^ =α + β1x1,i + β2x2,i + ...+ β p xp,i 
where Yi is the expression data of gene Y in the ith transcript profile experiment and Yi
^
 is the 
corresponding estimated value of Yi. We use as the 
estimating formula, where xj,i is the expression data of gene xj in the ith transcript profile 
experiment, α is the constant, and β1…βp are the regression coefficients. Our first step is to 
find the best fit of Yi with 
Yi
^ =α + β1x1,i + β2x2,i + ...+ β p x p,i
Yi
^
 by determining α and β1…βp, using the least square method, 
and then to verify whether all the genes, x1, x2,…, xp, taken together, significantly explain the 
observed Yi. To test the significance, we form the following hypotheses: 
H0: β1 = β2 = … = βp = 0    null hypothesis: Yi does not depend on the xi’s 
H1: at least one βi  ≠ 0     alternative hypothesis: Yi depends on at least one of the xi’s 
We perform an F-test on the regression as a whole. If the null hypothesis is true, the ratio: 
F =

has an F distribution with p numerator degrees of freedom and n-p-1 denominator degrees of 
freedom.  If the null hypothesis is false, then the F ratio tends to be larger than it is when the 
null hypothesis is true. We define PF = prob(Fp,n− p−1 > F) , where Fp,n-p-1 is the F value 
corresponding to a significance level. Therefore, if PF (p-value of F-test) is significantly 
small, we reject H0, and conclude that Yi is associated with at least one of the xi’s. In our

Results 
Identification of Transcription Modules 
 
As the accuracy of a transcription network depends on the correctness of its transcription 
modules, before verifying our method can reconstruct meaningful transcription networks, we 
demonstrate its performance of building significant transcription modules.  
A transcription module is composed of a particular transcription factor and its target 
genes. Although several techniques have been proposed to locate the target genes of a 
transcription factor, none of them was systematically evaluated to determine if known 
regulatory elements were better identified than by naïve searches (Quandt, et al., 1995; 
Lavorgna, et al., 1999; Zhang, 1999; Wolfsberg, et al., 1999). , To justify the feasibility of our 
new approach, we compared our method with PROSPECT (Fujibuchi, et al., 2001), which 
had been systematically evaluated. Like PROSPECT, we selected SCPD as the dataset for 
evaluation. We merged the information of recognition sites from SCPD (Zhu and Zhang, 
1999) and TRANSFAC (Wingender, et al., 1996). After removing the sites without sensible 
consensus and disregarding the regulators for which the gene(s) producing them is unknown, 
we selected 27 regulatory elements in our studies. We also used the same metric as in 
PROSPECT, the selectivity ratio, for comparison. For a particular method, the selectivity is 
the fraction of correctly predicted elements out of all elements predicted, and the selectivity 
ratio is defined as the ratio of its selectivity to that of a naïve pattern match method. In 
addition to selectivity, sensitivity is another important evaluation criterion. Despite the lack of 
full knowledge of true target genes, we simply define sensitivity as the fraction of correctly 
predicted elements out of all elements annotated in SCPD, assuming SCPD is complete.  
One important hypothesis behind our method is that there may exist potential 
relationships between the gene(s) producing a transcription factor and those regulated by this 
particular factor. Our experiments justified the hypothesis by showing that the target genes 
could be predicted by exploring the relationships through regression analysis. A lower PF 
value of the regression analysis between a transcription factor and genes suggests a stronger 
relationship between the transcription factor and these genes. To examine the effect of PF 
values on the selectivity ratio, we varied the PF threshold when testing the 27 elements. The 
results showed that for 16 elements, the selectivity ratio increased up to two or higher along 
the decrease of PF threshold. These 16 elements are ACE2, BAS1, BAS2, GCN4, GCR1, 
HAP1, HSTF, LEU3, MIG1, PDR3, PUT3, RAP1, REB1, SBF, SFF and STE12. The 
selectivity ratio fluctuated between one and two for nine elements, ABF1, ADR1, GAL4, 
MATα1, MATα2, MCM1, MBF, PHO4 and repressor of CAR1. Only for SWI5 and TBP did 
the decrease of PF threshold make the selectivity ratio worse instead. We show some of the 
results in Figure 4. Our empirical studies showed that when PF=0.03 and PEA=0.4, 
regression analysis and PROSPECT have the best overall performance respectively over the 
27 elements. We compared their results with those of naïve pattern searches. The results are 
summarized in Table 2. For selectivity ratio, regression analysis outperformed PROSPECT in 
16 elements but lost in 11 elements; as for sensitivity, PROSPECT did better in 14 elements 
and tied in four elements. The experimental results suggest that there indeed exists the 
association between some transcription factors and the target genes, and this relationship can 
be characterized by regression analysis.  
Since neither of regression analysis and PROSPECT outperformed the other in the 
prediction of all the 27 elements, we combined both approaches to benefit from the synergy. 
We consider a gene as a target gene of a particular transcription factor only if its PEA value 
and PF value are both smaller than some significance thresholds. We use both PEA and PF if 
available as the criteria to filter out false positives. To verify the performance of the 
combinatorial approach, we compared the performance of applying PEA or PF alone with that

each of which contains the binding site TCCGYGGA upstream of the gene. The similarity of 
their mRNA levels leads to a low PEA value and suggests that the genes are co-regulated via 
PDR3. The correlation between PDR3 and its target genes is reflected by the relationship 
between YBL005W’s mRNA level (which produces PDR3) and those of YDL011W and 
YDR406W. The relationship can be modeled by regression analysis and its significance is 
measured by F-test.

 of the increase in predictive accuracy, the 
approximation of 3D structures with only a 
3-letter alphabet is apparently too crude for the 
more refined 3D reconstruction [9-13]. Various 
more complex structural alphabets have been 
developed by taking into account the 
heterogeneity of backbone protein structures 
through sets of small protein fragments frequently 
observed in different protein structure databases 
[14-21]. Unlike most other works, we developed a 
multi-strategy method for structural alphabet 
design, which combined self-organizing maps, 
minimum spanning tree algorithm and k-means 
algorithm [22]. The performance of our alphabet 
was demonstrated by the competitive accuracy in 
all-alpha protein search within SCOP using the 
standard 1D sequence alignment tool, FASTA 
[23].  
In this paper, we introduced an improved 
version of our alphabet design pipeline, to which 
we added a substitution matrix self-trainer. The 
substitution matrix used in aligning proteins 
represented by structural alphabets affects the 
accuracy of alignment. In our earlier work, we 
applied the identity matrix in the alignment [22]. 
Though the preliminary results successfully 
demonstrated the feasibility of our alphabet, yet a 
more appropriate matrix will further improve its 
applicability. The substitution matrix is a crucial 
factor in the successful application of 1D sequence 
alignment tools to search for similar 3D structures. 
We thus developed an automatic matrix training 
framework that can generate appropriate 
substitution matrices for new alphabets when 
applied in standard 1D sequence alignment 
methods, e.g. FASTA. Based on the alphabet we 
constructed, we can transform proteins into 1D 
structural alphabet representations. To identify 
protein local structure features, we applied the 
motif-finding tool MEME [24] to detect the 
common motifs. We tested two protein families in 
SCOP, TIM and EGF. The results showed our 
method successfully recovered their structure 
domains.  
 
Materials and Methods 
  
The simplest substitution matrix to use is the 
identity matrix, but it ignores possible acceptable 
alphabet letter substitutions, which significantly 
limits its applicability. Some authors applied 
HMM approach to define the matrix [25], while 
others adopted a similar approach in the 
development of BLOSUM matrices [26,27]. Most 
of these approaches to constructing substitution 
matrices required the alignments of known 
proteins [27-29]. As the alignments may be 
unavailable or even questionable, we took a 
self-training strategy to build a substitution matrix 
for our new structural alphabet. This training 
framework is a flexible and modular design, and it 
does not rely on any pre-alignment of protein 
sequences or structures. This matrix training 
procedure can be applied regardless of how the 
alphabet is derived. Different training data or 
alignment tools available can be incorporated in 
this framework to generate appropriate matrices 
under various circumstances.  
There are three components in the matrix 
training framework, an alignment tool with a 
substitution matrix, training data, and a matrix 
trainer. We used FASTA as the alignment tool, 
and the non-redundant proteins in SCOP1.69 with 
sequence similarity less than 40%, excluding the 
families of size smaller than 5 proteins, as the 
training dataset. We started by using the identity 
matrix as the initial substitution matrix where the 
score is 1 for a match, 0 for a mismatch. Each 
protein in the training dataset was iteratively used 
as a query for FASTA to search the rest of the 
dataset for similar proteins. If a protein returned 
by FASTA belonged to the same family as the 
query, we considered the case as a positive hit; 
otherwise, a negative hit. Those proteins not 
returned by FASTA but in the same family as the 
query were considered as misses. For all positive 
hits and misses, we gathered their alignments with 
the query produced by FASTA. Based on the 
alignments, we computed the log-odd ratios 
defined in the same way as in the BLOSUM 
matrices [28] to build the positive matrix. 
Similarly, with the alignments of negative hits, we 
constructed the negative matrix.  The matrix 
trainer updated the current substitution matrix S(t) 
to S(t+1) as the following.

framework.

The average positive hit rate converged at 0.9153 with the 
learning rate set 0.5. 
 
To demonstrate the ability of our structural 
alphabet to describe protein local structure 
features, we used MEME [24] to detect common 
motifs in the top 100 hits found by our alignment 
tool. These motifs could be well mapped to the 
eight β/α barrel strands of TIM barrel domains. 
Figure 4(a) showed the structure of archaeon 
pyrococcus woesei  (PDB 1hg3a). In Figure 4(b), 
we highlighted the identified motif in PDB 1hg3a, 
and Figure 4(c) illustrated the motif structure. The 
structural alphabet letter sequence of this motif 
and the corresponding amino acids were shown in 
Figure 4(d). In addition to TIM barrel structures, 
we also used the EGF/EGF-like domain as another 
study case. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
domains are extracellular protein modules 
typically described by 30-40 amino acids 
primarily stabilized by three disulfide bonds. 
Compared with TIM barrel structures, EGF are 
much smaller domains. We used it to evaluate 
how well a structural alphabet could define the 3D 
structures of small proteins. Many proteins contain 
the regions of homology to EGF, and the cysteine 
residues at similar positions. The homologies and 
available functional data suggest that these 
domains share some common functional features. 
If we number the cysteine residues as Cys1 to 
Cys6, where Cys1 is the closest to the N-terminus, 
the regularity of cysteine spacing defines three 
regions, A, B and C. Based on the conservation in 
sequence and length of these regions, the 
homologies have been classified into three 
different categories [33]. We described the 227 
proteins in the EGF-type module family of SCOP 
1.69 in our alphabet, Yang & Tung’s [27] and de 
Brevern et al.’s [15,26,31], respectively. We then 
used MEME to identify the common motifs 
corresponding to the sub-domains, A, B and C. 
According to InterPro [34], 24 of these proteins 
were exclusively of EGF Type-1, 74 were of 
EGF-like Type-2, and 117 belonged to EGF-like 
Type-3 only. We classified the remaining 12 
proteins as Others.
