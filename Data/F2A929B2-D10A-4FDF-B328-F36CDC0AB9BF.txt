Introduction 
In recent years, advance micromachined/assembled micro probe arrays with electrical stimulation/recording 
ability have come to play an essential role in exploring central neural systems. Simultaneous observation of a 
larger number of cell activities has become the general requirement to understand the nervous system [1]. 
Advances in neuroscience and neuroprosthetics now require microelectrode arrays that are able to access 
numerous neurons simultaneously with high spatial resolution [2]. Recording of the extracellular action 
potentials has been accomplished by surgically implanting neural probes into the target neurons of interest, 
which resulted from neural activities [3]. Probes that could insert a large number of recording sites into neural 
tissues with minimal tissue damage are therefore needed. Also, the design of the probe arrays should be 
optimized for an experimental purpose that an electrode diameter of a few micrometers could support 
single-unit recording [4]. 
Background and paper review 
The traditional micro probes, which are made from insulated metal wires and glass micropipettes, cannot 
provide simultaneously multi-channel recording. The main reason is that the traditional devices function as 
only a single site on a single probe shaft. Some previous studies have improved the problem by thin-film 
lithography-based micromachining techniques since 1960s. 
High-density probe arrays yielded insights into the organization and function of the neural system [5]. 
Silicon [6], glass [7], polymer [8] and sapphire [9] substrates have been employed as thin-film electrode probe 
planks. The thin-film silicon micro probe was developed many years ago for neuroscience and neural 
prostheses [10]. It has also been widely characterized electrically [11] and mechanically [12] for probe scaling 
[13], insertion force [14], tissue strain [15] and chronic brain responses [16]. The studies mentioned above 
provide detailed multi-channel recordings along a single plane, but lacked of full cell activity information in 
3-D space [17]. 
To access the full cell activity that originates in the target tissue, three dimensional microprobe arrays are 
strongly required with precisely controlled dimensions and front-end circuitry compatibility. In other words, 
to achieve detailed studies of neural networks and implementation of neural prostheses, we need to access 
three-dimensional volumes of tissue with three-dimensional distributed recording sites. In modern neural 
system researches, 3D microprobe array allows the recording and mapping of the neural signal network and 
interconnections among the 3D brain structure. The recording and mapping would be impossible to achieve 
by using 2-D planar arrays [17].

assembly. For example, precise alignment was required to make probe shafts pass through holes of the 
supporting platform and steady the probe onto the vertical spacers without damage during the assembly 
process. Second, the probe arrays were fixed only by the perpendicular bonding pads and the tenons. Low 
structure strength can cause stability problem in implantation. Third, the rooms between the spacers and the 
2-D probes were wasted. The volume of a 3-D structure increases rapidly when increasing the number of 2-D 
probes. 
To improve the problems described above, this work reports a new stacking method for fabricating 3-D 
neural probe arrays. In this study, the 3-D orthogonal interconnection was replaced with 2-D wire bonding by 
the present stacking method, and the perpendicular bonding and snap fasteners which were used in previous 
work were no longer needed. Compared to previous work, this new stacking method can also provide reliable 
structure strength. ASIC chips can be substituted for spacers to increase the system integration and volume 
usage efficiency as well. Additionally, an anti-overflow design based on the capillary principle was exploited 
to avoid gel overflow onto proximate bonding pad during 3-D array assembly.

can be integrated with circuits by the present stacking method. Additionally, in IC manufacture, larger area 
means higher cost. When the active circuitry is fabricated with probe shafts in the back-end of the 2-D array, 
larger wafer areas are required. In the stacking design, spacers with circuitry and 2-D arrays were fabricated 
individually. Therefore, the stacking method can reduce the cost for circuitry integration and increase the 
design flexibility when modification of probes/circuitries is required for different applications. Besides, 
comparing with previous work, the volume usage efficiency was increased because there were no waste 
rooms between arrays and spacers. In short, the advantages of using active circuit chips as spacers include 
reducing the cost of circuitry integration, increasing the flexibility of the design and increasing the volume 
usage efficiency. 
The fabrication steps of the 2-D array are briefly described as follows: (1) 250 μm-thick silicon wafer was 
used, and 3 μm-thick polyimide (PI) was spin-coated on the front side of the wafer for electrical isolation. (2) 1 
μm-thick Cr/Au layer was electroformed and patterned for wire interconnects on the probe shaft. (3) 3 μm-thick 
layer polyimide (PI) was spin-coated for the interconnect encapsulation. (4) Electrode sites and wire-bonding 
pads were defined by DRIE. (5) 3 μm-thick Au was electroformed as electrode site and bonding pad material. 
Notably, the Au layer was somewhat over-electroformed to ensure that the electrode was in contact with the 
neural tissue while implantation. (6) The final shape of 2-D probe array was defined and released by DRIE. 
The spacers were simply defined on the 250 μm-thick silicon wafer by DRIE. For different application 
requirements, the thickness of the 2-D arrays and spacers could be modified by using thinner wafer. However, 
the yield minimal wafer thickness is currently not less than 100 μm due to the accessible process limitation. 
When the stacking method is used to construct the 3-D neural probe arrays, the overflow adhesion gel or glue 
between the stacking layers may cover the proximate bonding pads and make them ineffective. Using less gel 
may reduce the overflow problem, but reduce the adherent strength. To solve the overflow problem of the gel, 
an anti-flow mechanism design was applied in the stacking method.  
The anti-overflow mechanism was accomplished by creating a through-silicon-via around the edges of the 
spacers. It uses capillary action force to prevent the gel from overflowing to the bonding pads. The mechanism 
functions in the following condition: when the stacking process starts, the combined parts compress the 
adhesion gel and force it to flow around. The flowing glue will fill the via by capillary action as it passes the via. 
Therefore, there is no redundant glue covering the proximate bonding pads 
The radius of the via was one of the major design parameter in preventing overflow. The formula is given by 
the well-known capillary action principle [29] with definition of the liquid-air surface tension, contact angle, 
density of the liquid, acceleration due to gravity, the height of the liquid column and the radius of the via. In this 
case, the maximal height of the liquid column is the thickness of the spacer (250 μm), and the liquid-air surface 
tension is 0.033 N/m [30], contact angle is 70° [31], density is 2,000 kg/m
3
 and gravity acceleration is 9.8 m/s
2
. 
The capillary action principle gives the radius of the via a theoretical result of 4,600 μm, which was even larger 
than the size of the spacer. In fact, there is some limitations should be put into consideration. For instance, the 
limited volume of glue, the viscosity of glue, the friction force between glue-substrate interface and the 
capillary force in the narrow gap between two parts will make the liquid column never reach the expected height. 
The final via radius was experimentally set as 250 μm to enhance the filing of the via with glue.

3. Spacer3 was picked by the flip-chip bonder head and aligned with the 2-D array by an optical 
microscope.  
4. Then, Array4 & Spacer3 were bonded together in a pressurizing and heating condition provided by the 
flip-chip head.  
5. After the first bonding process finished, the flip-chip head was released from the Spacer3, and then 
adhesion gel was deposited onto Spacer3 by the micro injector.  
6. Next, Array3 was picked, aligned and bonded to the Spacer3 again.  
7. Repeating the bonding process 1 to 6, we accomplished the 4 × 4 3-D neural probe array.  
The maximal placement accuracy of the flip-chip was 0.5 μm in a single bonding step. Thus, the total 
miss-alignment error can be neglected. Moreover, the average assembly time for a 4 × 4 3-D microprobe array 
by manual alignment was approximately 35 minutes (including heat curing time). In the present study, we 
applied about 0.26 μL of gel between spacers and arrays. The appropriate amount of the adhesion get 
combined the stacking well without spilling to the proximate pads. 
Figures 3(A)–(G) illustrate how the anti-overflow mechanism functions in the practical assembly process. 
The details are displayed as follows: (A) the fabricated 2-D array (Arrayn) was fixed on the flip-chip holder 
(not shown). (B) A drop of thermosetting polymer was deposited onto the 2-D probe array and the spacer 
(Spacern) was picked by the flip-chip bonder head and aligned. (C) Start bonding – the aligned spacer was 
moved downward and controlled by the flip-chip bonder head. After the spacer came into contact with the 
glue drop, the drop spread in random directions because it was squeezed by the spacer. (D) The spacer was 
moved continuously downward, and the glue filled the via by capillary force when it flowed past the via. (E) 
The spacer came into contact with the 2-D array. The gel bump occurred on the top of the via because the 
pressure from bonding. (F) The flip-chip bonding head was removed. (G) The assembly process was 
completed following thermal solidification of the thermosetting glue. The gel bump over the via rapidly 
receded after heat curing.

Electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the fabricated stacked 3-D probe arrays. The 
impedance characterization of 3-D neural probe array in the electrode-electrolyte interface is of utmost 
importance in impedance-based biosensing and neuroprotheses [32]. When the electrode sites come into contact 
with tissue, an electrode-tissue interface impedance was established. The electrode-tissue interface impedance 
and the amplifier input impedance act as a voltage divider when a neural signal passes through the electrode into 
the front-end amplifier. Hence, high electrode-tissue interface impedance will cause signal attenuation and 
induce considerable thermal noise in weak raw signal recording.  
The final assembled array was characterized in physiologic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) at room temperature 
using a multi-frequency LCR meter (Wayne Kerr LCR meter 4235). Figure 5 presents the measured impedance 
of the electrodes (n =16) on the microprobe. The in-vitro impedance was 463 ± 107 kΩ and the phase was -33 
degree at 1 kHz.

anesthetized rat. (B) The in situ location of microprobe array was shown in the photomicrograph 
Nissl-stained coronal section. (C) The 16-channel neural activities simultaneously recorded from 
CA1 in of hippocampus. 
The minimal opening is the area that must be resected, including skull and dura, to fully place an implantable 
device onto the brain. A smaller skull opening can reduce the implantation damage such as the rise of 
intracranial pressure, and the probability of wound infection. In previous work, the opening area was never less 
than the supporting platform [22,23] to make sure all the probes were completely inserted into tissue. Therefore, 
the minimal surgical opening area was defined by the supporting platform in this case. Additionally, the 
supporting platform area was significantly increased when ASIC chips were mounted onto the platform for 
system integration [2]. In the proposed stacking method, the system integration will not increase the opening 
area because it can be accomplished by replacing spacers with ASIC chips. The opening area of present 3-D 
probe array depends only on the probe array dimension. The minimum opening area of the stacked 3-D probe 
array is less than 1.75 mm × 1 mm, which can be readily shrunk by using thinner and narrow shafts.  
Previous work may also induce additional tissue damage in the bottom of the platform as well. The 
interlocking structures, including tethers and joints, can cause the protrusion and damage to the tissue 
underneath [2]. For the stacked 3-D array, only probe array will be in contact with the target tissue.  
The strength of the assembled structure is also an important issue in implantable device. Compared with the 
proposed 3D array, structures with tethers and joints used in previous work may not provide reliable strength to 
fix the probes on the platform during implantation [2,22]. The thermosetting polymer in the stacked 3-D array 
provided an adhesive strength of 150–180 kg/cm3 after curing. Thus, sufficiently structural strength was 
guaranteed in the present design. 
In summary, compared with previous 3-D array studies, the advantages of using the stacking method for 
constructing 3-D arrays include easier assembly processes, stronger structure strength, smaller opening area and 
less damage to the tissue surrounding the implanting region. ASIC chips can be substituted for spacers to
