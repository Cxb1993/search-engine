(DFT)-based channel estimation technique is proposed. 
The proposed technique based on the concept of 
significant channel tap detector (SCTD) scheme. The 
correlation of two successive preambles is employed 
to estimate the average noise power as the threshold 
for obtaining the SCTD threshold estimation error and 
loss path information resulting in performance 
degradation in large delay spread channel 
environment. The proposed estimation scheme could 
also roughly predict the noise power in order to 
choose the significant channel taps to estimate the 
channel impulse response. Some comparative 
simulations are given to show that the proposed 
technique has potentials to improve the bit error 
rate performance compared with the conventional least 
squares channel estimation.

二、 研究目的 
 
近年來，無線通訊的各項應用已經成為現代人生活中不可或缺的一部份，生活上或工作上的需求
驅使無線通訊系統不斷地演進，朝向更高資料傳輸率(higher information transmission rate) 、更高移動
速度(higher mobility) 以及多媒體應用(multimedia applications)的目標邁進。而無線通訊廣播的優勢在於
可以實現高速移動中接收訊號和產品方便攜帶，因此，數位多媒體廣播系統 (digital multimedia 
broadcast-terrestrial/handheld, DMB-T/H)的發展正是大眾所期待的。 
其中，正交分頻多工調變技術(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, OFDM)在許多的4G通訊標
準之中被選定為重要的調變技術。而數位多媒體廣播系統是採用時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術(time 
domain synchronous OFDM, TDS-OFDM)(如圖一)，利用偽雜訊序列(pseudo-random noise sequence, 
PN-sequence)形成框架標頭(frame head, FH)來取代傳統循環字首正交分頻多工調變技術(cyclic prefix 
OFDM, CP-OFDM)系統的循環字首做為保護間隔，並同時作為系統同步與通道估測。因此訊號在頻域
上沒有放置導引信號，比傳統循環字首正交分頻多工調變技術具有更高的頻譜效率。 
時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術的原理是將訊號在時間域和頻率域的傳輸結合起來的一種混合處
理方式(如圖二)，在頻域(frequency domain, FD)如同正交分頻多工調變技術傳送資料，在時域(time 
domain, TD)則於訊號前的保護區間置入兩段特殊結構的偽雜訊序列做為框架標頭(frame head, FH)，取
代傳統循環字首正交分頻多工調變技術的循環字首。框架標頭可做為通道估測技術與頻率飄移估測技
術的訓練符元(Training Symbol)。 
時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術在資料調變的部分還是使用正交分頻多工調變技術。正交分頻多
工調變技術對於頻率的同步要求相當嚴格，主要造成頻率飄移的原因為本地振盪器(local oscillator)的不
匹配(mismatch)，些許的頻率飄移就會造成子載波之間相互干擾(inter-carrier interference, ICI)。訊號在
大氣中傳播，將通過許多不一樣的環境，這些環境造成不同的多重路徑延遲(multipath delay)，造成所
謂的符元之間相互干擾(inter-symbol interference, ISI)之間相互干擾。是故有效的通道估測技術與頻率飄

 四、 研究方法 
 
現行的時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術的訊號架構使用的是雙偽雜訊序列框架標頭(如圖三)。所謂
的雙偽雜訊序列框架標頭就是將兩段相同的偽雜訊序列放置在時域訊號之前，可表示為 
 
其中我們接收訊號(如圖三)，就可以表示為被通道影響過的雙偽雜訊序列與傳送資料 
 
 
 
圖三 雙偽雜訊序列框架標頭與接收訊號示意圖 
 
所以接收訊號就是我們的這三個部分的疊加

圖五 在短通道下位元錯誤率效能圖

 這兩個估測頻率飄移各有優缺點，第一個準確，但較容易受到大頻率飄移的影響，大二個較不準
確，但是對於大頻率飄移的影響較能容忍。經由這兩個估測值，我們得到四個估測子 
 
這是因為估測的演算法只有在正負半子載波頻寬，而我們預先補償的數值，有可能會使得估測子進入
到別人的估測範圍，而造成誤差。在比較過這幾個估測子的差值，我們選擇最小的差值 
 
來決定我們最終的估測頻率飄移值 
 
 
圖七表示各種頻率飄移方法之誤差平方均值效能圖。之前的文獻可以看出，Moose所使用的方法，
因為使用的相關長度較短，雖然不準確，但是能容忍比較大的頻率飄移值。Park 所使用的方法，因為
使用的相關長度較長，非常準確，但是能容忍的頻率飄移值就小的很多。我們所提出的方法，基於上
述兩者的演算法，重新設計過框架標頭，並且結合兩種演算法的優缺點，在各種的頻率飄移值之下，
都有很好的效能。 
圖八表示在短通道下各種頻率飄移方法之誤差平方均值效能圖。可以看出，Moose所使用的方法
與 Park所使用的方法，對於不同的頻偏值都還是跟圖七有一致的結果。我們所提出的方法，在各種的
頻率飄移值之下，都有很好的效能。 
圖九表示在長通道下各種頻率飄移方法之誤差平方均值效能圖。我們所提出的方法，在低訊號雜
訊比的情況下，有與 Moose相同的現象，是因為在通道與雜訊的影響下，Moose 的演算法在我們的演
算法之中會扮演著比較重要的腳色，不過因為系統多運作於高訊號訊比，所以我們所提出的方法，在
各種的頻率飄移值之下，還是有很好的效能。

本計畫著重於時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術系統之頻率飄移估測技術與通道估測技術研究。本
篇論文的貢獻，在頻率飄移估測技術方面，首先補償一個粗估的頻率飄移值，接著使用設計過的前導
符元之間的相關函數可以得到一個精確的頻率飄移值。本計畫報告書證明提出的演算法，相對於使用
傳統的方法，在於誤差平方均值效能上面的提升均有顯著的改善；在通道估測技術方面，因為傳統的
方法都提出於傳統循環字首正交分頻多工調變技術，不適用於時域同步正交分頻多工調變技術架構之
下，並且本計畫報告書提出的演算法，在有大的多重路徑延遲環境底下依然適用。本計畫報告書不僅
提供了論文本文，也提供許多驗證，證明提出的演算法，相對於使用傳統的方法，在於位元錯誤率效
能上面的提升均有顯著的改善。

Abstract— In this paper, an improved discrete Fourier trans-
form (DFT)-based channel estimation technique is proposed for
time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division mul-
tiplexing (TDS-OFDM) communication systems. The proposed
technique based on the concept of significant channel tap detector
(SCTD) scheme could effectively improve the system performance
of TDS-OFDM systems. The correlation of two successive pream-
bles is employed to estimate the average noise power as the
threshold for obtaining the SCTD threshold estimation error and
loss path information resulting in performance degradation in
large delay spread channel environment. The proposed estimation
scheme could also roughly predict the noise power in order
to choose the significant channel taps to estimate the channel
impulse response. Some comparative simulations are given to
show that the proposed technique has potentials to improve the
bit error rate performance compared with the conventional least-
squares channel estimation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) has been adopted in the
national digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) stan-
dard for the People’s Republic of China [1]. In practice,
effective channel estimation (CE) techniques for coherent
OFDM communications are highly desired for the purpose of
demodulating/detecting received signals and improving system
performance. This is because they often operate in the en-
vironments where signal reception is inevitably accompanied
by long multipath delay spreads caused by time-dispersion.
Several research works have been undertaken dealing with
cyclic-prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) CE problems by using the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) processing [2]–[4]. The main
idea of those DFT-based CE methods is to obtain the time-
domain channel impulse response (CIR) by using the inverse
discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) and only choosing the prior
taps with CP-length (i.e., CIR-length is typically assumed to be
less than or equal to CP-length). In addition, a method called
significant channel tap detector (SCTD) can be employed to
derive the optimal threshold to determine significant channel
taps [4]. Then, the channel frequency response (CFR) can be

obtained by feeding the chosen CIR into DFT. However, the
previous studies are only in the context of CP-OFDM where
the methods can not fit the TDS-OFDM frame structure.
In this paper, a CE technique is investigated in order
to extend DFT-based CE methods to TDS-OFDM system.
The proposed technique takes advantage of a DFT-based CE
method to obtain the CIR by using IDFT with only preamble-
length taps which are less than those of typical DFT-base CE
methods (i.e., the typical DFT-based CE methods use data-
length taps). While choosing the significant CIR (i.e., the taps
contain the multipath information), the proposed technique
takes advantage of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimation [5] in
order to estimate the noise power.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the TDS-OFDM system description and frame
structure are briefly introduced. The conventional CE tech-
niques are derived in Section II and the proposed CE tech-
nique is developed in Section III. The comparative simulation
results obtained using the proposed CE technique and the
conventional methods are provided in Section IV. Finally,
some concluding remarks are given in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND CHANNEL ESTIMATION
A. TDS-OFDM Systems
A baseband equivalent TDS-OFDM system is shown in
Figure 1. At the transmitter side, the TDS-OFDM is a hybrid
approach for combined signal in time domain and frequency
domain transmission. Data transmission uses OFDM technique
in the frequency domain. In the time domain, the pseudo-
random noise (PN) sequence is inserted as a frame header to

D. DFT-Based Channel Estimation
DFT-based channel estimation exploits a property of CP-
OFDM systems having the symbol period much longer than
the duration of the CIR. Because the estimated CIR from LS
has most of its power concentrated on a few first samples, the
DFT-based estimation reduces the noise power that exists in
only outside of the CIR part [3] [4]. The length of the estimate
CIR (2) is typically no longer than L and the symbol period is
much longer than the duration of the CIR. Therefore, CIR can
be divided into two parts: CIR with noise part and only noise
existing part. CIR is contained in the prior L samples and other
samples are only noise. These processes can be expressed as
follows
hˆDFT (n) =
{
hˆLS(n), 0 ≤ n ≤ L− 1
0, L ≤ n ≤ M − 1
(3)
From (3), the DFT-based channel estimation is denoted as
HˆDFT (k) = DFTN{hˆDFT (n)}, 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1 (4)
III. PROPOSED CHANNEL ESTIMATION
According to the previous work [5], The signal power can
be expressed as
S(i) = R
(i)
I + R
(i)
Q (5)
where RI and RQ are correlations of in-phase and quadrature-
phase components. They can be written as
R
(i)
I = E{r
(i)
I (n + M)r
(i+1)
I (n + M)}
R
(i)
Q = E{r
(i)
Q (n + M)r
(i+1)
Q (n + M)}
where r(i)I (n) and r
(i)
Q (n) are the in-phase and quadrature-
phase components of r(i)(n).
In this paper, the CIR is considered to be time-invariant.
The proposed SNR estimator Sˆ(i) that is based on correlation
method to estimate the signal power S(i) can be written as
Sˆ(i) =

The received signals for SNR estimation are y(i)2 (n) in present
frame and y(i+1)2 (n) in next frame. Because the noise is zero-

Therefore, the noise power can be estimated by subtracting the
estimated signal power from total received power as follows:
Wˆ (i) =
1

|r(i)(n + M)|2 − Sˆ(i) (8)
As a result, the CIR can be chosen from the following decision
rule
hˆpro(n) =
{
hˆLS(n), otherwise
0, if PLS(n) < λ
(9)
where PLS(n) = |hˆLS(n)|2 represents the power of nth
channel tap and λ is the threshold. The optimal threshold
is obtained by multiplying the estimated noise power and a
constant weight. The threshold can be expressed as
λ = αWˆ (i), (10)
where α is a positive constant to be chosen according to the
later experiment results. The proposed CFO estimation is
Hˆpro(n) = DFTN{hˆpro(n)}, 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1 (11)
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
The fundamental requirements of the DPNP TDS-OFDM
system investigated here are shown in Table I. The commonly-
used tapped-delay-line channel model was employed in the
following simulation experiments. The China test 8 (CT8)
channel [7] and the typical urban (TU) environment with the
power intensity profile listed in Table II were also employed
in the simulation experiments.
Figure 5 shows that the mean square error (MSE) for various
α with different SNR. It is obvious that the threshold is
optimal when α = 5. Our main purpose is to reduce the
noise interference in order to improve the system performance.
The result shows that the larger threshold may cause path
information leakage and the smaller threshold may introduce
noise effect.
In Figure 6, the proposed improved channel estimation
method has better performance than the conventional DPNP

Improved Frequency Offset Estimation
Technique in TDS-OFDM Systems
Wen-Jeng Lin∗ and Jung-Shan Lin†, Member, IEEE
Abstract—Time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency di-
vision multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) is one of OFDM-based trans-
mission techniques, so it still has to cope with the issue of
frequency synchronization. In this paper, a novel estimation
technique is developed for the correction of frequency offset in
TDS-OFDM systems. The proposed synchronization algorithm
utilizes the correlation between two symmetric halves of a train-
ing sequence after the appropriate usage of coarse compensation.
As a result, the proposed estimation method indeed has the
potentials to further enhance the mean square error (MSE)
performance with extensive estimation range. Some comparative
simulations by using Chinese standard of digital terrestrial tele-
vision broadcasting (DTTB) are given to illustrate the advantages
of the proposed frequency offset estimation technique.

tion, training sequence, DTTB.
I. INTRODUCTION
FOR reducing spectral overhead on pilot, the TDS-OFDM[1], [2] technique replaces cyclic prefix (CP) with pseudo-
noise (PN) sequence and removes pilot from OFDM signal.
Thanks to its higher channel throughout, TDS-OFDM has
been adopted as one of the key modulation schemes for
Chinese standard of DTTB. The DTTB system is based on the
digital video broadcasting (DVB) standard [3] in Europe. Both
channel estimation [4], [5] and synchronization [6]–[8] are
important issues in TDS-OFDM systems. Due to the Doppler
effect and the mismatched local oscillators, carrier frequency
offset (CFO) destroys the orthogonality between the subcarri-
ers and causes inter-carrier interference (ICI). Therefore, the
CFO must be accurately estimated and compensated to ensure
reliable system performance in TDS-OFDM systems.
The frame head with the time domain PN sequence is
used for synchronization in TDS-OFDM systems. For fre-
quency synchronization, the correlation method [6], [7] and
the differential correlation scheme [8] were usually employed.
The authors of [6] employed two frame heads for frequency
synchronization which included the coarse, common and
fine frequency estimation methods. The common estimation
method only used one frame head for calculation. However,
two frame heads were employed for the utilization of the fine
estimation scheme.
For CP-OFDM systems, in general, there were some lit-
eratures [9]–[12] which used the maximum likelihood (ML)

algorithm to jointly estimate the timing and frequency offset
with higher complexity. Some conventional methods [13]–[17]
were employed to estimate the timing and frequency offset by
adding training sequence or preamble. The authors of [17]
proposed a new preamble for timing synchronization. When
this preamble scheme was employed to estimate frequency
offset, the performance had better improvement. From the
viewpoint, this preamble scheme may be considered to apply
for the frame head in TDS-OFDM systems. Therefore, a
modified preamble from [17] and a new estimation scheme
are provided for frequency synchronization to achieve better
system performance.
In this paper, a novel estimation method with a particular
preamble pattern is proposed for the correction of frequency
offset. First of all, the coarse compensation is used for a rough
synchronization. Then, an improved CFO estimation method
is proposed with the comparison of two particular correlation
functions. When the proposed estimation method employs
the given preamble pattern, the MSE performance could be
further improved. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows. Section II introduces the general model of TDS-
OFDM systems. Section III briefly describes the estimation
method in [6] and Section IV develops the proposed estimation
strategy for frequency offset. In Section V, some comparative
simulations based on the DTTB standard are given to illustrate
the advantages of proposed scheme. Finally, the concluding
remarks are drawn in Section VI.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
An OFDM signal consists of a sum of many subcarriers
which are modulated by using phase shift keying (PSK) or
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). An advantage of the
OFDM technique is that the modulator and the demodulator
can be easily implemented by inverse fast Fourier transform
(IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The signals after
IFFT are expressed in the following:
xn =
1√
N
N−1∑
k=0
Xke
j2pikn
N , n = 1, 2, · · · , N (1)
where Xk is the complex PSK or QAM symbol and N is the
total number of subcarriers. After the insertion of PN sequence
with the length of Ng, a typical TDS-OFDM frame in the
transmitter end is completed. Fig. 1 shows the typical TDS-
OFDM frame structure with the frame head of PN sequence.
Due to the effect of frequency offset, the received signal can
be expressed as follows:

partial preamble, and wC1 and wC2 are noise terms.
Then, the correlation values of PC1 and PC2 are used to
estimate the CFO value ε. The CFO estimation values from
PC1 and PC2 can be calculated as follows:
εˆC1 =
N
Ng + 1
φC1
2pi
εˆC2 =
N
LCyc + 1
φC2
2pi
(15)
where
φC1 = tan
−1 Im(PC1)
Re(PC1)
φC2 = tan
−1 Im(PC2)
Re(PC2)
Hence, the corresponding estimation values for the actual CFO
ε should be re-calculated as
εˆα = εˆC1 + σ (16)
εˆβ =


εˆα − vc, if σ > 0
εˆα + vc, if σ < 0
εˆα, if σ = 0
(17)
εˆγ = εˆC2 + σ (18)
where vc = NNg+1 , −vc ≤ σ ≤ vc, εˆα and εˆβ are required to
recognize the accurate estimation value, and the εˆγ is used
to be a standard value. Finally, the desired common CFO
estimation value can be calculated as follows:
εˆC =
{
εˆα, if min{D1, D2} = D1
εˆβ , if min{D1, D2} = D2 (19)
where
D1 = (εˆα − εˆγ)2
D2 = (εˆβ − εˆγ)2
In (19), if D1 is the minimum value, it means that the exact
estimation result is εˆα. Hence, the desired CFO estimation
value εˆC = εˆα is obtained. Otherwise, if D2 is the minimum
value, then the desired CFO estimation value εˆC = εˆβ is
obtained. From the previous estimation steps, the proposed
scheme can be summarized in the flow chart shown in Fig. 5.
The coarse compensation is executed in the beginning. Then,
the correlation functions are calculated. The CFO estimation
values have three results. The two results (εˆα,εˆβ) are for CFO
detection and the other result (εˆγ) is for standard value. Finally,
the actual CFO estimation value is determined by comparison.
Using the method in [14], the variance of system performance
is computed by
varP,C =

B. Fine Estimation Scheme
The two received frame head signals are used in the
proposed fine frequency estimation. The modified preamble
pattern in (12) is still used for the fine frequency synchroniza-
tion. The whole procedure of the estimation steps is developed
as follows:
The coarse compensation needs to be calculated for two
received signals. The signal rn is generated for coarse com-
pensation and is given as follows:
rn = rne
−j2piηn
N
= xne
j2piεn
N + wn
(21)
where n = 1, 2, ..., 2Ng+N , ε = ε−η with a chosen constant
η for coarse compensation, and wn is a new noise term after
coarse compensation. The property of the modified preamble
is employed for the desired correlation functions, which are

Fig. 9 shows the MSE performance of both Gui’s scheme
and the proposed scheme by using common frequency esti-
mation at different SNR. It has better performance by using
the proposed estimation scheme. Fig. 10 shows that the
common frequency estimation techniques can also be used at
small frequency offset ε = 0.40, but their performances are
relatively poor. When the fine frequency estimation schemes
are employed, the system performance becomes better than
that of the common estimation. From Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the
simulation results are very close to the variance theories.
At the large frequency offset ε = 5.0, the fine frequency
estimation schemes are not suitable anymore. Hence, the
common frequency offset estimation techniques are employed
in large frequency offset estimation. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12
show that the Gui’s and proposed schemes with common

MSE performance of proposed scheme has better improvement
than that of Gui’s scheme.

Fig. 13 and Fig. 14, the system performance by using fine
frequency estimation is better than the system performance by
using common frequency estimation at the small frequency
offset ε = 0.40. All results show that the MSE performance
of proposed method has better improvement than that of Gui’s
scheme.

Fig. 1. The block diagram of conventional hybrid scheme.
In general, for OFDM systems with Gaussian time domain
samples, the CCDF of PAPR can be written as
Pr(PAPR > PAPRo) = 1− (1− e−PAPRo)N (4)
III. CONVENTIONAL HYBRID SCHEME
In the beginning, the conventional hybrid (CH) method
combining the SLM with PTS schemes is investigated. The
strategy was first explicitly proposed by P. A Pushkarev in
[12]. The block diagram of the CH method is shown in Fig. 1.
The original OFDM symbol is multiplied with the U phase
rotation sequences, and then each of the new OFDM symbols
is partitioned into V pairwise disjoint sub-blocks. Those
OFDM sub-block values are calculated by each optimization
of PTS blocks. For simplicity and without loss of generality,
V = 2 is always considered in this paper. Each signal xˆ(u),
where u = 1, . . . , U , with the lowest PAPR is selected by each
optimization block. They can be written as
{bˆ(u)1 , bˆ(u)2 } = argmin
{b(u)1 ,b(u)2 }
{ 2∑
v=1
b(u)v x
(u)
v
}
(5)
xˆ(u) =
2∑
v=1
bˆ(u)v x
(u)
v (6)
where 1 ≤ u ≤ U .
By the selection block, the relatively lower PAPR can be
obtained from those lowest PAPR values of each PTS block.
Because those lowest PAPR values of each PTS block are
statistically independent to each other, the CCDF of CH
scheme can be written as
CCDFCH =
(

(
PAPRPTS > PAPRo

In order to recover transmitted data information, the receiver
must have the knowledge of side information. Because the CH
signal must include the side information of SLM and the side

information of PTS, the number of required side information
bits can be written as
NCH = log2U + (V − 1)log2W (8)
where W is the number of allowed phase rotation factors. In
(8), the first term expresses the SLM required side information
bits and the second term is the additional bits from the PTS
algorithm.
IV. PROPOSED HYBRID SCHEMES
A. Additional hybrid scheme
In order to improve the PAPR reduction performance in CH
scheme, we have to generate a large number of alternative
OFDM signal sequences without increasing the number of
IFFT to avoid high computational complexity. Here, a new
additional hybrid (AH) scheme by combining the modified
SLM scheme with CH scheme. The system performance is
desirable that the number of IFFT is reduced but the PAPR
reduction performance is not compromised. The block diagram
of AH scheme is shown in Fig. 2.
Clearly, the first U signals xˆ(u), where u = 1, . . . , U , are
the same as the signals (6) in the CH scheme. Furthermore,
the alternative OFDM signal sequences are generated by the
linear combination of the sub-block signals from different
PTS blocks after IFFT operation. Using the linear property of
Fourier transform, the linear combination of these sequences
can be obtained by
x(u)v = c
(i)x(i)v + c
(k)x(k)v (9)
where U + 1 ≤ u ≤ U2, 1 ≤ i, k ≤ U , 1 ≤ v ≤ 2, and
c(i) and c(k) are some coefficients to be chosen later. That
is to say, if we have OFDM signal sequences x(i)v and x(k)v ,
the other alternative OFDM signal sequences in (9) can be
obtained without performing IFFT operation. Now, we would
investigate how to make each element of x(i)v and x(k)v to have

MH 5.3dB log2(2U2 − U) + (V − 1)log2W
Using the linear property of Fourier transform, the linear
combination of U phase rotation sequences can obtain ex-
cessive 2
(

)
alternative OFDM sequences. After optimization
blocks, those overall lowest PAPR xˆ(u) can be written as
the same as (11). Using the switching technique among
PTS blocks, the signals of U phase rotation sequences can
obtain excessive 2
(
U
2
)
alternative OFDM sequences. After
optimization blocks, those overall lowest PAPR xˆ(u) can be
written as the same as (14).
In the MH scheme, if V = 2 and U phase rotation sequences
are considered, the original signals x(u)v can generate excessive
2
(
U
2
)
pairs of sequences respectively and simultaneously by
either additional block or switching block. Therefore, there
are total 2U2 − U OFDM sequences with the lowest PAPR
in the MH scheme. In order to recover the transmitted data
information, the number of required side information bits can
be obtained by
NMH = log2(2U2 − U) + (V − 1)log2W (16)
V. COMPARATIVE SIMULATION RESULTS
The system parameters for comparative simulations are
listed in Table I. The PAPR reduction performance with the
CH scheme for various values of U is shown in Fig. 5. It
shows that the PAPR reduction performance becomes better
as the number of U increases. Obviously, in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7,
the performance of AH scheme is similar to that of SH scheme.
The AH and SH schemes with U = 2 and U = 4 have almost
the same performance compared with the CH scheme with
U = 4 and U = 16, respectively. In Fig. 8, the MH method
with U = 2 and U = 4 has almost the same performance
compared with the CH scheme with U = 6 and U = 28,
respectively.
From the simulation results, we can expect that those ex-
cessive alternative OFDM signals generated from the original

sequences of CH scheme in the AH, SH and MH methods
should be almost different from the OFDM sequences in
the CH scheme. Therefore, the MH scheme possesses the
best PAPR reduction performance with minor increase of
computational complexity. The system complexity of various
PAPR reduction schemes for OFDM systems is given in Table
II, where the number of IFFT is fixed to be 8, that is, U = 4,
V = 2 and W = 4.
In Table III, the system complexity with similar PAPR
reduction performance is discussed. If CCDF = 10−3 is con-
sidered, the MH scheme needs only one-third of the number
of IFFT compared with the CH scheme when the threshold
PAPRo is 6.1dB. When the threshold PAPRo is 5.3dB, the
MH scheme needs only one-seventh of the number of IFFT.
Therefore, the required number of IFFT in the MH scheme is
less than that in the CH scheme.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In general, the PAPR reduction performance becomes better
as the number of U increases in CH scheme, but the CH
scheme has high computational complexity because of the
increase of the number of IFFT. Therefore, based on original
signals of CH scheme, several powerful algorithms have been
proposed to improve high PAPR reduction performance with-
out increasing the number of IFFT, including AH, SH and MH
schemes. The MH scheme can obtain the best PAPR reduction
performance by combining the AH with SH schemes. After
a number of comparative simulations, the MH scheme has
shown that the excellent PAPR reduction performance can be
achieved without increasing the number of IFFT.
To sum up, the proposed MH scheme has obtained a
superior PAPR reduction performance for OFDM systems.
The technique has a better PAPR reduction performance by
increasing the number of alternative OFDM sequences. In
particular, when the number of IFFT is the same, the MH
scheme has the best PAPR reduction compared with CH, AH
and SH schemes. Therefore, for the MH scheme, it can expend
less IFFT units to obtain similar PAPR reduction performance
without the dramatic increase of side information bits.
