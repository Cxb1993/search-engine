Investigation of Provincial Economy Performance in China: 
Bayesian Stochastic Frontier Analysis1

Abstract 
 
This study investigates the economic performance for the thirty-one provinces of 
China in primary, secondary, and service sectors as well as the overall industry over 
the period of 1978-2007. We select each province’s total revenue (a proxy of 
economic performance) as the output variable, labor cost and total investment in fixed 
assets as the input variables. Cobb-Douglas stochastic production function is specified 
and Bayesian analysis technique is adopted to estimate the production function. The 
results indicate that, on average, the overall production efficiencies in China are 0.641, 
0.829, and 0.886 for primary, secondary, and service sectors, respectively, provided 
that truncated normal distribution is imposed on the error term. Those provinces with 
less production efficiencies are identified and the likely factors causing poor 
performance are further scrutinized. Based on the findings, some promising strategies 
for improving the production performance are proposed.

The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews 
some relevant studies. The methodology used in this paper is described in Section 3. 
The empirical analysis with discussion is presented in Section 4, followed by 
concluding remarks with possible avenues for future research. 
2. Literature Review 
Many researchers have paid attention to evaluating the efficiency and 
productivity of China’s industries since it adopted the economic reform. Using the 
provincial statistics 1985-1991, Wu (1995) examined total factor productivity growth 
of China’s agriculture, state, and rural industries. His results indicated that there is 
great scope for improvement after economic reform. He also found that technological 
progress dominates the technical efficiency change as the main source of total factor 
productivity growth in all three sectors of the economy. Kalirajan et al. (1996) used 
the Chinese provincial-level agricultural data of 1970-1987 to explain how to 
decompose the sources of total factor productivity growth into technological progress 
and technical efficiency change. Their results indicated that, 20 out of 28 provinces 
have experienced total factor productivity regress during the study period. Tong (1999) 
examined the changes in productive efficiencies of township and village enterprises 
(TVEs) in different provinces between 1988 and 1993 by using the stochastic 
production frontier analysis. The results indicated that the production efficiencies of 
TVEs, on average, are improved but the differences among provinces are narrowed.  
Hu and McAleer (2005) estimated technical efficiency of the agricultural sector 
in China. In their study, panel data comprising 30 provinces over 1991-1997 were 
analyzed and Cobb-Douglas production function was specified. Their findings 
indicated that the technical efficiency has improved in most provinces, but the gap 
between the affluent coastal region and the hinterland in the west has increased. Rae 
et al. (2006) estimated total factor productivity for four major livestock products in 
China by using the stochastic frontier approach and further decomposed productivity 
growth into efficiency change and technical progress components. Their results 
revealed that growth in total factor productivity and its components varied between 
the 1980s and the 1990s as well as over the production structures. The results also 
showed that, despite considerable technical innovation in China’s livestock sector, 
technical efficiency improvement has been relatively slow. Chen et al. (2008) 
analyzed the productivity growth in agricultural sector over 1990-2003 for 29 
provinces in China with the sequential DEA approach. Their results indicated that the 
regional disparities in productivity growth worsen over time and that the major source 
of productivity growth is technological progress, rather than efficiency changes. The 
results also revealed that the main determinants of technical progress are agricultural

used TN and HN forms. 
For the TN form modeling, we follow Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) by 
assuming that 
(a) vi ~ iid N (0, σv2); 
(b) ui ~ iid N+(μ, σu2); 
(c) vi and ui are distributed independently of each other, and of the regressors. 
With the assumptions that vi follows normal distribution, and ui follows TN 
distribution, their probability density functions can be written, respectively, as:

where µ  denotes proportionality; yp q is referred to as the posterior pdf 
(probability density function) for the parameter vector θ, given the sample 
information y; p(θ) is the prior pdf for the parameter vector θ; and the term qyp  
is the well-known likelihood function, which is defined as the joint probability density 
function for all the data conditional on the unknown parameters. 
Based on Bayes theorem described above, we know that in order to implement 
the Bayesian analysis for the purpose of estimation, it requires working out the 
likelihood function and eliciting a prior for θ so as to draw the posterior density 
function. Then, the posterior probability function is utilized to obtain parameters, θ. 
The method for deriving likelihood function has been described in the previous 
subsection. As for the prior pdf, conjugate prior distribution has been widely selected 
in the Bayesian analysis context despite that it has been questioned as too subjective 
by some statisticians. 
Once both prior pdf and likelihood function have been worked out, one can 
derive the posterior pdf, which is then used as prior in the next iteration. Reiterate the 
procedures until the convergence is obtained. These complicated procedures make 
numerical integration methods inevitable. To date the most appropriate method is 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which was introduced by Koop et al. (1995) 
and has been widely used in almost all recent Bayesian analysis studies. See, for 
example, O’Donnell and Coelli (2005), Kumbhakar and Tsionas (2005), among others. 
More recently, Griffin and Steel (2007) introduced a quite powerful and flexible 
computer program, called WinBUGS, for implementing the Bayesian stochastic 
frontier analysis. Using this powerful computer software, the complicated procedures 
with a large number of data can be easily accommodated.

Figure 1 shows the composition trend of three industries in China over the period 
1978-2007. Notice that the share of service industry has increased from 24 percent in

the terms of first and second orders, the results shows that the coefficients of second 
order terms are all insignificantly different from zero, we thus discard the second 
order terms and re-specify a Cobb-Douglas production, same as previous works (for 
example, Wu 1995; Tong 1999; Hu and McAleer 2005). To test if the Cobb-Douglas 
production is sufficient to explain the production behavior or not, we first regress total 
revenue on both input factors by ordinary least squares (OLS). The estimation results 
are indicated in Table 2 and show that all coefficients are positive and significant at 
significance level of 10 percent, and the adjusted R-squares are 0.977, 0.550, 0.960 
0.976 for overall, primary, secondary and service sectors, respectively. Note that, all 
determinant coefficients are rather high with an exception of primary sector, 
suggesting that Cobb-Douglas production function has a good fitness and choosing 
these factors is also sufficient to explain total revenue. Thus, the stochastic production 
frontier function becomes:

【Insert Table 2 here】 
4.3 The Results  
We estimate parameters and efficiencies by equation (16), using the computer 
program WinBUGS, developed by Spiegelhater et al. (2003). For comparison, both 
HN and TN distributions are imposed. The results are displayed in Table 3 
(parameters) and Table 4 (efficiencies). To test if HN and TN are significantly 
different, the Spearman rank-correlation test is conducted. The results indicate that the 
hypothesis of without significant difference between HN and TN cannot be rejected. 
Since the HN is more restrictive (μ = 0), which is a special case of TN, hereinafter 
the discussion will be based on the TN results. 
【Insert Table 3 here】 
From the estimated results shown in Table 3, the coefficients of 1b  and 2b  in 
overall industry and three sectors are all positive and significantly different from zero. 
Based on the results, the four models become:

inefficient in another, suggesting that each province may have its own strength 
industry; it is no necessary to develop all sectors. Taking Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang 
as examples, these three provinces belong to hinterland region and are credited as 
efficient in primary sector, but inefficient in secondary and service industries; thus, 
further elaborating the primary industry, rather than secondary and service industries, 
could be a good strategy for these three provinces. 
We classify 31 provinces into three regions, which are coastal, central, and 
hinterland regions, and then further investigate if there is any difference of 
performance between any two regions. The t-tests for testing difference between 
paired population means are conducted, and the results are displayed in Table 5. Note 
that some null hypotheses of without difference between two regions are rejected at 
5% level of significance (e.g., the performances of service sector between coastal and 
central regions) and that some null hypotheses cannot be rejected (e.g., the 
performances of service sector between central and hinterland regions).

5.  Concluding Remarks 
This study estimates the efficiency of three sectors (primary, secondary, service) 
as well as overall industry for 31 China’s provinces by specifying Cobb-Douglas 
production function estimated by Bayesian analysis technique. Our empirical results 
have revealed that, of 31 provinces, Tibet, Ningxia, and Shanxi are the most efficient 
provinces in primary, secondary, and service sectors. Meanwhile, Beijing is the 
benchmark province in terms of overall industry. For those provinces with poor 
performance, one of possible ways of improvement is to increase their total revenues, 
keeping input factors unchanged. 
Different sectors might be operated under different technologies, thus one of the 
contributions of this study is that we estimate technical efficiency for each sector 
separately. The results indicate that some provinces are credited as efficient in one or 
two sectors but inefficient in another, suggesting that effective strategy for improving 
provincial economic performance should focus on the least efficient sectors. 
Furthermore, since the elasticity of labor cost with respect to total revenue in both 
secondary and service sectors are larger than that in primary sector, the policy 
implication is that, for those poor economic performance provinces, consuming more 
labor sources on the secondary and service sectors might be a better strategy than on 
the primary sector.  
Several avenues for future study can be identified. In this study, only two input

production technology. The production function is in general used to properly 
elucidate a single-output technology. It requires only the amounts of output and inputs. 
On the other hand, the cost function can well depict the multiple-output multiple-input 
technology, but it requires such data as detailed input prices and the costs for each 
firm. It is a challenge to collect such detailed confidential price and cost data, 
especially in the international contexts subject to dynamic currency exchange rates. 
Another alternative that can deal with multiple-output multiple-input production 
technology is the distance function, which was originally introduced by Shephard 
(1970) and extended by Färe and Primont (1995). Since then, the estimation of 
distance function has attracted increasing attention in the efficiency and productivity 
measurement. 
Classical maximum likelihood (ML) method was the most popular technique for 
estimating the parameters of stochastic frontier models and firm-specific inefficiency. 
It can be easily exercised with different computer software packages such as LIMDEP, 
SHAZAM, FRONTIER4.1, among others. However, ML method cannot produce 
prediction intervals for firm-specific or industry technical inefficiencies (Coelli et al., 
2005). Moreover, ML method frequently violates the monotonicity, concavity, and 
convexity conditions implied by economic theory (Griffiths et al., 2000). Once the 
estimated parameters of a distance function violate these regularity restrictions, it will 
lead to estimated elasticities and shadow prices that are incorrectly signed and 
ultimately to perverse conclusions (O’Donnell and Coelli, 2005). Such perverse 
conclusions can be avoided by implementing Bayesian approach with the use of 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations (van den Broeck et al., 1994). The 
use of MCMC has become more and more popular due to the availability of 
inexpensive high-speed computers with the development of powerful 
computer-intensive statistical algorithms. These algorithms, for instance, the Gibbs 
sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be used to draw samples from a 
marginal probability density indirectly, without having to derive the density itself 
(Griffiths et al., 2000). Consequently, the interest has been devoted to the use of 
Bayesian approach for making inference in stochastic frontier models in recent years 
(Griffin and Steel, 2007). The Bayesian method has particular advantages in SFA 
contexts, including exact (small-sample) inference on inefficiencies, easy 
incorporation of prior ideas and restrictions (e.g., regularity conditions), and formal 
treatment of parameter and model uncertainty. For instance, Coelli et al. (2005, p.231) 
pointed out that the use of Bayesian approach to inference has the following 
characteristics: 
(a) Estimators are chosen based on their ability to minimize the loss associated with 
an estimation error.

2.1 Stochastic Production Frontier Model 
To estimate firm-level efficiencies, we start from stochastic production frontier (SPF) 
model. Following Aigner et al. (1977), the SPF model can be defined as 
iiiiiii TEvxfuvxfy ´´=-´´= )exp();()exp()exp();( bb                   (1) 
where yi is the output of ith firm and vi is symmetric random error term. Aigner et al. 
(1977) assumed that vi follows a normal distribution with zero mean and constant 
variance and that ui is non-negative independently and identically distributed (iid) 
random variable, which captures technical inefficiency of firms. The technical 
efficiency of firms (TEi) is defined as

i
ii ,...,,)exp();(
)exp( =
´
=-=
b
                           (2) 
In order to estimate ui, one has to impose an appropriate distribution form (e.g. 
half-normal, truncated-normal, exponential, gamma, etc.) on the model. Since the 
truncated-normal distribution is the generalization of half-normal ones, and has been 
widely adopted by researchers, in this study we thus assume that the inefficiency term 
follows truncated-normal distribution. Following Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000), we 
assume that 
(a) vi ~ iid N (0, σv2); 
(b) ui ~ iid N+(μ, σu2); 
(c) vi and ui are distributed independently of each other, and of the regressors. 
With the assumptions that vi follows normal distribution, and ui is truncated normal 
distribution, their probability density functions can be written respectively as:

2.2 Bayesian Analysis 
Bayesian analysis is based on Bayes theorem of probability. Suppose we wish to 
perform inference on a vector of model parameters, let p(y, θ) denote the joint 
probability density function for a random observation vector y and a vector of 
parameters θ, both vectors are random. Then, according to usual operations with 
probability density functions, we have 
)()(),( ypyppypyp ×=×= qqqq                                   (11) 
And thus,

q

= , with p(y) ≠0.                                   (12) 
We can rewrite (12) as follows: 
function, likelihoodpdfprior             
)(
´µ
×µ qqq yppyp
                                (13) 
Where µ  denotes proportionality; yp q is referred to as the posterior pdf 
(probability density function) for the parameter vector θ, given the sample 
information y; p(θ) is the prior pdf for the parameter vector θ; and the term qyp , 
is the well-known likelihood function, which is defined as the joint probability density 
function for all the data conditional on the unknown parameters. 
Based on Bayes theorem described above, we know that in order to implement the

point in the sample. As O’Donnell and Coelli (2005) pointed out that monotonicity 
violations will give rise to incorrectly signed elasticities, with the perverse implication 
that efficiency can be improved by increasing inputs while holding outputs fixed, and 
curvature violations will lead to the result that the production possibility frontiers are 
convex to the origin, implying the solutions to first-order conditions for revenue 
maximization will not be points of maximum revenue. These types of perverse results 
are obviously unsatisfactory. It is thus necessary to seek an effective method to 
impose the required regularity conditions on the parameters of an estimated translog 
output distance function.  
Since the translog functional form can provide a second-order approximation to any 
arbitrary functional form, based some previous studies, the translog output distance 
function that represents the production technology of railways’ services involving M 
outputs and R inputs is specified as follows:

where α0, αm, αmn, βr, βrs, and δrm are the parameters to be estimated. Moreover, these 
paremeters satisfy the identifying restrictions αmn=αnm and βrs=βsr for all m, n, r and s. 
To estimate the parameters, the homogeneity constraints are imposed. From Euler’s 
theorem, homogeneity of degree one in outputs implies:

For D to be quasi-convex in x over the non-negative orthant it is sufficient that all the

The output distance function D specified in this study will be convex in y over the 
non-negative orthant if and only if H is positive semidefinite. In other words, D will 
be convex in y if and only if all the principal minors of H are non-negative. In our 
case study on 41 selected European railways, we have two outputs—passenger and

4. Empirical Study 
4.1 The Data 
This study focuses on multi-product railways which provide both passenger and 
freight services. The single-product railways providing only passenger or freight 
service are not considered. Our data set, drawn from International Railway Statistics 
published by the International Union of Railways (UIC), contains 41 European 
railways over the period of 2004-2006. Thus the total number of DMUs is 123. We 
follow the previous studies by using the number of employees, length of lines (a 
proxy of capital), and the number of cars (sum of freight wagons and coach cars) as

Note that the stochastic output distance function must be non-decreasing in outputs 
and non-increasing in inputs. Non-decreasing in outputs means that partial derivatives 
of the D with respect to y must be greater than or equal to zero. For a Cobb–Douglas 
specification 0³ib ensures global monotonicity. However, for a translog

production technologies and of no bother collecting confidential input/output price 
(cost) information. However, using the classical maximum likelihood (ML) method to 
estimate the distance functions would probably generate undesired results, which 
oftentimes violate the regularity restrictions implied by economic theory and thus lead 
to perverse conclusions. In this paper, we employ an alternative approach—Bayesian 
analysis to estimating the distance function to rectify such a drawback. 
We select the railway industry as the empirical case and specify a flexible functional 
form—translog output distance function to represent the production technology. The 
decisions making units (DMUs) came from 41 European railways over the years of 
2004 to 2006. Both ML and Bayesian methods are adopted to estimate the parameters 
of the distance functions and to measure the technical efficiencies for all DMUs. The 
results supported that ML method has led to incorrect signs of the elasticities, 
violating the economic theory; while Bayesian analysis has satisfactorily rectified this 
drawback. Based on these findings, we concluded that ML method failed to account 
for the regularity conditions implied by economic theory. In contrast, Bayesian 
procedures can easily incorporate the monotonicity and curvature constraints into the 
specified output distance function and can result in better estimated parameters with 
more reasonable firm-specific efficiencies than classical ML method. Therefore, 
Bayesian analysis is recommended for estimating the stochastic distance function and 
for measuring the firm-specific technical efficiencies. 
Some directions for future study are identified. First, an in-depth investigation on each 
DMU deserves further compared to gain more insights into the causes of efficiency or 
inefficiency. Some external factors affecting the technical efficiencies can also be 
taken into account in the future study. In addition, different businesses or industries 
with other flexible distance function specifications can be attempted to test the 
robustness of our proposed Bayesian procedures, in comparison to the classical ML 
method.

(2010), among others. However, except for Chen et al. (2008), they did not look into 
the economic performance for individual province. To authors’ best knowledge, 
investigation of China’s economic performance for primary, secondary, or tertiary 
sector has yet been explored to date. Most of the provinces in China are facing the 
dilemma of choosing the most promising sector for further development. This study 
attempts to measure the production efficiencies of China’s disaggregate (each sector) 
and aggregate (overall) economic performances at the provincial level and then to 
investigate the niche ones for further development for individual province. 
The approaches of measuring production efficiency generally contain two major 
streams: non-parametric and parametric methods—the former, coined as data 
envelopment analysis (DEA); while the later, called stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). 
SFA method has some advantages over DEA, for instance, SFA accounts for noise, 
and can be used to conduct hypothesis tests. In this study we thus adopt SFA to 
estimate the production efficiency for each province. As for the estimation method, 
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally utilized to estimate the 
parameters and efficiencies. Unfortunately, MLE method sometimes yields incorrect 
signs of estimated parameters, and thus could lead to perverse conclusions. To avoid 
this shortcoming, Bayesian approach is adopted in this study. More specifically, we 
will examine the provincial economic performance by specifying a stochastic 
Cobb-Douglas production function and employing the Bayesian approach to 
estimating the parameters and efficiencies. 
The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews 
some relevant studies. The methodology used in this paper is described in Section 3. 
The empirical analysis with discussion is presented in Section 4, followed by 
concluding remarks with possible avenues for future research. 
5. Literature Review 
Many researchers have paid attention to evaluating the efficiency and 
productivity of China’s industries since it adopted the economic reform. Using the 
provincial statistics 1985-1991, Wu (1995) examined total factor productivity growth 
of China’s agriculture, state, and rural industries. His results indicated that there is 
great scope for improvement after economic reform. He also found that technological 
progress dominates the technical efficiency change as the main source of total factor 
productivity growth in the three industries under consideration. Kalirajan et al. (1996) 
used the Chinese provincial-level agricultural data of 1970-1987 to explain how to 
decompose the sources of total factor productivity growth into technological progress 
and technical efficiency change. Their results indicated that, 20 out of 28 provinces

of three sectors in China. 
3. Methodologies 
This section describes the methodological procedures used in the study, 
including the modeling and the estimation. Subsection 3.1 provides a brief review on 
stochastic production frontier model. Subsection 3.2 addresses the Bayesian analysis 
method. 
3.1 Stochastic Production Frontier Model 
To estimate firm-level efficiencies, we start from stochastic production frontier 
(SPF) model. Following Aigner et al. (1977), the SPF model can be defined as 
iTE)iexp(vβ);if(x)iuexp()iexp(vβ);if(xiy ´´=-´´=                     (1) 
where yi is the output of ith firm and vi is symmetric random error term. Aigner et al. 
(1977) assumed that vi follows a normal distribution with zero mean and constant 
variance and that ui is non-negative independently and identically distributed (IID) 
random variable, which captures technical inefficiency of firms. The technical 
efficiency of firm i (TEi) is defined as 
N1,2i

ii ,...,,)exp();(
)exp( =
´
=-=
b
                            (2) 
In order to estimate ui, one has to impose an appropriate distribution form, such as 
truncated-normal (TN), half-normal (HN), exponential, gamma, etc. on the model. 
Both TN and HN forms are mostly used in previous works, therefore, this study also 
used TN and HN forms. 
For the TN form modeling, we follow Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) by 
assuming that 
(a) vi ~ iid N (0, σv2); 
(b) ui ~ iid N+(μ, σu2); 
(c) vi and ui are distributed independently of each other, and of the regressors. 
With the assumptions that vi follows normal distribution, and ui follows TN 
distribution, their probability density functions can be written, respectively, as:

where )( ×F  is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Because vi is 
independent of ui, the joint probability density function of ui and vi is the product of 
their individual density functions, expressed as follows.

Once the conditional distribution is derived, one can easily obtain the log likelihood 
function in the same manner as in (7). The technical efficiency of firms for both 
Normal-truncated normal and Normal-half normal cases thus becomes (Jondraw, et al, 
1982)

Battese and Coelli (1988) proposed another point estimator for TEi as follows: 
[ ]iiuEiTE e-= exp                                                   (12) 
For any nonlinear function g (x), E[g (x)] is not equal to g (E[x]). In this case, 
Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) indicated that eq. (12) is superior to eq. (11). 
3.2 Bayesian Analysis 
Bayesian analysis is based on Bayes theorem of probability. Suppose we wish to 
perform inference on a vector of model parameters, let p(y, θ) denote the joint 
probability density function for a random observation vector y and a vector of 
parameters θ, both vectors are random. Then, according to usual operations with 
probability density functions, we have 
)()(),( ypyppypyp ×=×= qqqq                                     (13)                         
And thus,

= , with p(y) ≠0.                                    (14) 
We can rewrite (12) as follows:

)(
´µ
×µ qqq yppyp                                   (15) 
where µ  denotes proportionality; yp q is referred to as the posterior pdf 
(probability density function) for the parameter vector θ, given the sample 
information y; p(θ) is the prior pdf for the parameter vector θ; and the term qyp  
is the well-known likelihood function, which is defined as the joint probability density 
function for all the data conditional on the unknown parameters. 
Based on Bayes theorem described above, we know that in order to implement 
the Bayesian analysis for the purpose of estimation, it requires working out the 
likelihood function and eliciting a prior for θ so as to draw the posterior density

across provinces, ranging from 34 to 3,108 billion RMB, with mean 889 and standard 
deviation 760 billion RMB, respectively. Also note that those provinces with higher 
percentages in both secondary and tertiary sectors will generally lead to higher total 
revenue. It is interesting to see that those vastly developed provinces with higher total 
revenue, such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, count only 1-3 percent in primary 
sector and nearly half in both secondary and tertiary sectors. 
【Insert Table 1 here】 
4.2 Model Specification 
To model the production technology, one has to specify a parametric functional 
form. The transcendental logarithmic (translog) production function is perhaps one of 
the most widely used in previous works since it can be used approximately to model 
any functional form in second order (Christensen et al., 1973). However, an 
econometric model can never completely capture the reality, some abstraction or 
simplification is inevitable in any modeling process (Gujarati, 1999). To seek the 
appropriate specification where estimation makes sense, specifying an appropriate 
functional form and carefully selecting variables into a model become the important 
tasks. The principle of parsimony tells us that a model should be kept as simple as 
possible, as if there is any presence of unnecessary variable, the estimation results will 
be biased. 
We firstly specify a translog production and estimate all parameters, including 
the terms of first and second orders, the results shows that the coefficients of second 
order terms are all insignificantly different from zero, we thus discard the second 
order terms and re-specify a Cobb-Douglas production, same as previous works (for 
example, Wu 1995; Tong 1999; Hu and McAleer 2005). To test if the Cobb-Douglas 
production is sufficient to explain the production behavior or not, we also regress total 
revenue on both input factors by ordinary least squares (OLS). The estimation results 
are indicated in Table 2, which show that all coefficients are positive and significant at 
significance level of 10 percent, and the adjusted R-squares are 0.977, 0.550, 0.960 
0.976 for overall, primary, secondary and tertiary sectors, respectively. Note that, all 
determinant coefficients are rather high with an exception of primary sector, 
suggesting that Cobb-Douglas production function has a good fitness and choosing 
these input factors is also sufficient to explain total revenue. Thus, the stochastic 
production frontier function becomes: 
uvxxy -+++= )ln()ln()ln( 2211 bba                                  (16)

closer to the best practice, while the primary sector (largely agriculture) is much far 
away from the frontier, taking the sector of 31 provinces as a whole.  
【Insert Table 4 here】 
At the disaggregate level, for the overall industry, the top three efficient 
provinces are Beijing (0.942), Chongqing (0.932), and Liaoning (0.927); while the 
three least efficient provinces are Hainan (0.766), Guangdong (0.802), and Hebei 
(0.838). The reason for those provinces becoming efficient is partly because that they 
are able to adjust their economic structure. Taking Beijing as an example, in 2008 the 
shares of its GDP in primary, secondary and tertiary sectors are counted for 1, 27, and 
72 percent, respectively. Recently, the city’s investment continued to favor the tertiary 
industry in the year of 2007 due to hosting of 2008 Olympic Games, with a 31.9 
percent expansion in infrastructure, of which transportation and energy sectors were 
up 53.7 and 28.3 percent respectively. As a consequence, the industrial sector 
recorded the highest growth rate of 12.9 percent, while the service sector surged by 
11.9 percent, meanwhile the agricultural sector declined by 1.7 percent (Beijing 
Municipal Bureau of Statistics, 2007). In contrast to Beijing, Hainan is an opposite 
example, its GDP shares of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors are counted for 
29.5, 29.8, and 40.7 percent, respectively. Located off southern coast of China, with a 
small population and inconvenient transportation networks, Hainan developed slowly, 
lagging behind the mainland over 40 years. In 2008, the GDP of the entire province 
totaled only 122 billion RMB. As mentioned earlier, the primary sector, such as 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and sideline production are the least 
value-added, those provinces with higher percentage in primary sector will generally 
lead to lower efficiency score. Thus, the policy implication for those inefficient 
provinces is to develop the secondary and tertiary industries, rather than primary 
sector. 
For the primary sector, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and 
fishery, the average efficiency of 31 provinces is 0.641, suggesting that there still has 
about 36 percent inefficiency in this sector. Table 4 also indicates that the top three 
efficient provinces are Tibet (0.803), Qinghai (0.785), and Xinjiang (0.780). This is 
partly because these provinces have vast land, which is suitable for development of 
agriculture. Meanwhile, the three least efficient provinces are Jiangsu (0.486), 
Guangdong (0.488), and Zhejian (0.508), all belong to coaster region. It can be partly 
attributed to these three provinces are well developed in secondary and tertiary sectors, 
rather than agriculture. Our finding is consistent with the previous works, for example, 
Hu and McAleer (2005).

then further investigate if there is any difference of performance between any two 
regions. The t-tests for testing difference between paired population means are 
conducted, and the results are displayed in Table 5. Note that some null hypotheses of 
without difference between two regions are rejected at 5% level of significance, for 
example, the performances of tertiary sector between coastal and central regions, thus 
we conclude that the performance of tertiary sector in coastal region is superior to that 
in central region. While some null hypotheses, for instance, the performances of 
tertiary sector between central and hinterland regions, cannot be rejected at 5% level 
of significance.

5.  Concluding Remarks 
This study estimates the efficiency of three sectors (primary, secondary, and 
tertiary) as well as overall industry for 31 China’s provinces by specifying 
Cobb-Douglas production function estimated by Bayesian analysis. Our empirical 
results have revealed that, of 31 provinces, Tibet, Ningxia, and Shanxi are the most 
efficient provinces in primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, respectively. 
Meanwhile, Beijing is the benchmark province in terms of overall industry. For those 
provinces with poor performance, one of possible ways of improvement is to increase 
their total revenues, keeping input factors unchanged. 
Different sectors might be operated under different technologies, thus one of the 
contributions of this study is that we estimate technical efficiency for each sector 
separately. The results indicate that some provinces are credited as efficient in one or 
two sectors but inefficient in another, suggesting that effective strategy for improving 
provincial economic performance should focus on the least efficient sectors. 
Furthermore, since the elasticity of labor cost with respect to total revenue in both 
secondary and tertiary sectors are larger than that in primary sector, the policy 
implication is that, for those poor economic performance provinces, consuming more 
labor sources on the secondary and tertiary sectors might be a better strategy than on 
the primary sector.  
Several avenues for future study can be identified. In this study, only two input 
factors are included in the analysis of efficiency for primary sector. Based on the 
underlying theory of agricultural economics and some previous studies, for example, 
Wu (1995); Hu and McAleer (2005); Chen et al. (2008), we may also include other 
input factors such as land into the modeling. Our empirical results also indicate that 
the efficiencies of coaster, central, and hinterland regions are significantly different. 
As such, the metafrontier production function, proposed by Battese et al. (2004), may

Measuring Performance for Rail Transport by Using Bayesian Stochastic 
Frontier Analysis Methods 
林村基10，藍武王11，張正成12 
摘要 
對於鐵路運輸績效評估可歸納兩種方法，其一，資料包絡分析法，其二為隨機前
緣分析法，後者必須先宣告函數型式，再以最大概似法校估參數，進而估計各廠
商之效率值，但此法存在一缺失，即校估之參數常因符號不正確而違反生產經濟
學之理論，導致奇怪的結論。為改正此一缺失，本研究改以貝氏隨機前緣分析法，
按貝氏之優點是得以強加限制於模型上，校估之結果符合經濟學之正規條件。在
實證方面，本研究以24家歐盟國家的鐵路公司2006至2008年的營運資料，實證結
果顯示，貝氏隨機前緣分析法確實能得到令人較為滿意之結果，根據實證分析結
果，本研究提出若干結論與建議，以供鐵路公司管理階層及後續研究之參考。 
關鍵詞：最大概似法，貝氏分析，超越對數產出距離函數 
Abstract 
Maximum likelihood (ML) method is commonly used to estimate the parameters of 
specified functional forms while evaluating the efficiency and/or productivity in 
production economics. The ML method, however, oftentimes yields incorrect signs of 
estimated parameters, violates the regularity conditions, and thus leads to perverse 
conclusions. To correct this drawback, this paper proposes an alternative 
approach—Bayesian analysis to estimate the parameters of distance function with 
imposition of regularity restrictions. Some railways in European Union countries are 
selected as the tested samples. A flexible output translog distance function is specified 
to represent the multiple-output multiple-input railway production technology with 
imposition of monotonicity and curvature conditions. For comparison, the stochastic 
output distance function is respectively estimated by ML method and by Bayesian 
procedures. The results indicated that the shortcomings incurred by ML method can 
be effectively corrected. Therefore, Bayesian analysis is recommended to measuring

效不佳之原因，以期找出問題所在，再針對問題提出改善之具體建議，作為經
營者之參考。 
欲評估企業之績效，必先掌握評估之方法，文獻上對於決策單位(Decision 
making unit, DMU)效率或生產力的衡量，可歸納為四種方法，其一為指數法
(Index number, IN)，又可分為偏要素生產力(Partial factor productivity, PFP)和總
要素生產力(Total factor productivity, TFP)，其二為最小平方法(Least squares, 
LS)，其三為資料包絡分析法(Data envelopment analysis, DEA)，其四為隨機前
緣分析法(Stochastic frontier analysis, SFA)。近年來學界分析廠商之效率，以前
述 DEA及 SFA為主流。DEA法具有若干優點，例如不需事先設定函數型態、
可應用於多投入、多產出之企業、不需價格資料等，廣為效率評估研究學者所
採用，但最常被計量經濟學派批評者，不外乎 DEA 係確定性效率前緣法
(Deterministic frontier methods)，也就是將觀測點直接與實務最佳者 (Best 
practice)比較，從而得出其效率值，並未考慮到統計誤差，亦不能進行假設檢
定。至於以 SFA 法分析廠商之技術效率，必須先宣告一預設的函數型式
(Functional form)，再校估參數及廠商之效率，傳統的參數校估方法係以最大概
似法(Maximum likelihood method, MLE)來校估，然而MLE在校估參數時卻忽
略了正規條件(Regularity condition)的限制，導致校估結果常違反生產經濟學的
原理，為改善此一缺失，本研究評估 2006年至 2008年歐洲鐵路公司之技術效
果，除宣告 Translog 產出距離函數(Output distance function)以解決多元產出
(Multiple outputs)之限制外，並應用貝氏隨機前緣分析法(Bayesian stochastic 
frontier analysis)來校估參數及分析廠商之技術效果。 
本文其餘章節之安排如下：第二節回顧鐵路績效評估之相關文獻，第三節
說明本研究採用之分析方法，包括 SFA法、產出距離函數及貝氏分析法，第四
節說明變數定義、資料分析與實證結果，第五節提出本研究之結論及未來研究
之建議。  
2. 文獻回顧 
2.1鐵路運輸績效評估相關文獻 
過去衡量鐵路運輸效率的文獻頗多，大部分採用 DEA法或 SFA法，本研
究主要目的係評以貝氏隨機前緣分析法評估鐵路運輸之效率，茲舉數篇鐵路公
司績效評估之研究文獻，並說明其使用之投入、產出變數、分析方法及重要結
論。 
Gathon and Perelman (1992)以 SFA分析 1961至 1988年 19個歐洲國家鐵
PDF created with pdfFactory Pro trial version www.pdffactory.com

Graham et al. (2003) 建立 Cobb-Douglas生產函數，評估 1994至 1998年
世界 17家城市鐵路交通的經濟規模和密度。其選取投入變數為勞工、車輛數、
路線長、車站數，至於產出變數為乘客旅程數與車公里。實證結果顯示，衡量
的規模收益不變，但密度會隨著報酬而遞增。另外，平均勞動生產力的重要性
方面，主要是說明每位勞工的產出多寡，以及轉移到其他因素的生產力和技術
變革。 
藍武王、林村基 (2003)衡量 1999年世界 74家鐵路公司之效率，並以 SFA
法及 DEA法之 CCR 與 BCC模式評估，其投入變數為營運路線長度、車輛數
及員工人數三項，產出變數為列車公里一項，研究結果發現，技術無效率廠商
主要源自過多車輛及人員之投入，整體而言，非洲地區國家鐵路公司之效率值
較西歐、美國、日本等為低，至於民主國家鐵路公司的效率值比共產國家高，
而技術效率愈高的鐵路公司，其營運路線之規模也較大；研究結果亦發現，荷
蘭鐵路（NS）在 DEA兩個模式的效率值皆為 1，排名為第一，若以 SFA進行
衡量，效率排名則為第二。 
O’Donnell and Coelli (2005)以貝氏隨機前緣模式 (Bayesian stochastic 
frontier model)，並建立蒙地卡羅(Markov chain Monte Carlo, MCMC)之產出距離
函數衡量 1988 年至 1993 年歐洲 17 家鐵路公司之效率，在變數選取上，以員
工人數、路線長及車輛數等三項為投入變數，至於產出變數則有客運服務與貨
運服務兩項。研究結果發現，隨機與固定假設的相對技術較強加規律性限制式
敏感；另外，校估距離函數之參數經常違反經濟學的單調性(Monotonicity)、準
凸性(Quasi-convexity)與凸性(Convexity)之條件限制，將會導致所估計的彈性
(Estimated elasticities)和影子價格(Shadow price)的符號不正確。 
Lan and Lin (2006) 建立 Translog投入與產出之距離函數，評估 1996年至
2002年世界 39家鐵路公司之績效，並以 SFA 法校估其參數及投入效率與產出
效果，其投入變數為勞力、車輛、路線等三項，產出變數為產出為客車公里、
貨車公里兩項，至於運輸消費則為延人公里、延噸公里兩項，研究結果指出，
鐵路技術無效率與服務效果不彰主要是受到國民所得、電氣化比率及營運路線
密度的影響，整體而言，西歐地區鐵路營運較東歐與非洲地區效率高。 
Couto and Graham (2008)以 SFA評估 1972至 1999年歐洲鐵路之成本結
構，並建立 Translog成本函數衡量在資源配置和技術效率的生產力，其投入變
數為勞工、能源與設備，選取延人公里與延噸公里，以及旅客列車公里、貨運
列車公里與車公里為產出變數。實證結果發現，歐洲鐵路的效率低的原因是在
成本上增加了 15%左右，與過去研究不同的是，配置效率低下，約有一半是成

圖 1生產不具可貯存性之商品或服務廠商之效率衡量(以鐵路運輸為例)  
鐵路運輸績效之服務無效果，係指所生產的運輸服務未能充分被消費者
(乘客)利用，造成產品腐爛、營收欠佳，通常可藉由延人公里、客車公里及營
運收入等得知，並可了解產出與消費間之關連性，故服務效果著重於業者所提
供運輸服務被旅客利用之程度。在評估運輸業之績效時，須注意運輸業與一般
製造業產品的特性有很大的不同，一般有形的商品，生產後如未能立即銷售，
尚可庫存以待他日俟機再行售出，但運輸服務不同於一般有形的商品，因其具
有易腐性，如廠商未能及時售出其服務，則所生產的運輸服務將無任何效用，
例如航空公司所生產的運輸服務，在機門關閉的瞬間，其未售出的座位形同腐
爛的商品，不再具有任何經濟價值。 
2.3 DEA法與 SFA法之比較

方法相較之下，DEA法並未考慮到統計誤差，亦不能進行假設檢定。至於 SFA

3.1 SFA 
假設產出 y 係由 i 個投入(xi)所生產，由於廠商在實際的生產過程中面對
許多不確定性，例如罷工、天候、運氣等，隨機性前緣之生產函數可定義如下： 
iiiiiii TEvxfuvxfy ´´=-´´= )exp();()exp()exp();( bb  (1) 
此處 vi 為隨機誤差項，呈常態分配，平均數為 0，變異數為常數，用以
代表量測誤差及其他不確定因素，而 ui 為一非負之隨機變數，用以衡量廠商
生產之技術無效率。 
為校估 ui 的值，必須先假設 ui 的分配型態，Aigner et al. (1977)建議 ui 
可為半常態分配 (Half-normal distribution, HN)或是指數分配 (Exponential 
distribution)。本研究係為構建 ui為半常態分配的 SFA模式，半常態分配之 SFA
模式有下列三點假設： 
(1) vi ~ iid N (0, σv2); 
(2) ui ~ iid N+(0, σu2); 
(3)vi和ui互相獨立，且與各解釋變數間亦互為獨立。

3.3 產出距離函數(Output distance function) 
在經濟學中生產技術可以用技術集合來描述，技術集合如下： 
S={(x, y): x 能生產 y}   (10) 
假設此處的生產技術滿足標準集合的公理，(Färe and Primont, 1995, p. 27)，包括
凸性(Convexity)、強可拋性(Strong disposability)、密合性(Closednes)、以及有界
(Boundedness)。Färe and Primont (1995)證明此一生產技術亦可用產出距離函數來
描繪，如下： 
})/,(,0:min{),( SyxyxD Î>= ddd   (11) 
加諸於生產技術集合的這些假設，隱含產出距離函數為產出量 y 的非遞
減(Non-decreasing)、線性同質(Linearly homogeneous)、凸性的函數，同時也是
投入量 x 的非遞增(Non-increasing) 和準凸性的函數。若集合(x, y) 屬於生產集
合 S，則 D(x, y)£1進一步來說，若集合(x, y) 屬於生產集合 S 的前緣，則則
否

4. 實證分析 
4.1資料來源 
本研究實證分析之資料取自國際鐵路聯盟(International union of railways, 
UIC)的統計年報，考慮受評估之單位應具有均質性(Homogeneity)，也就是各鐵
路公司應使用相同的投入，生產相同的運輸服務，以使績效評估具有意義，因
為歐陸各鐵路公司具有互通路網的特性，部分鐵路公司所使用的動力車(Power 
car)具有變壓器，可適用於不同國家之多重電源，此即為可轉換電壓式動力裝
置，備此裝置即可行駛至路網相通的國家，再加上各會員國在歐盟統一的指令
下經營，根據 EU91/440 政策指令開放，及其隨後修正或附加的指令，例如
EU2001/12指令，各會員國鐵路公司逐漸形成歐陸大路網，經營條件更是日趨
一致，為鐵路公司跨國比較效率、效果中最具有同質性者。經選取歸屬於歐盟
會員國的 24家鐵路公司 2006年至 2008年之營運資料，總計有 72個觀測點。 
鐵路運輸具有多元產出之特性，其投入之生產要素為勞力、客運車輛、貨
運車輛及營運路線等，產出(運輸服務)則為延人公里(yp)、延噸公里(yf)兩項。
另考慮 24 家鐵路公司之營運規模容有差異，本研究改以單位營運里程之投入
及產出資料，也就是將統計年報上之原始投入產出資料，分別除以各該公司之
營運路線長。表 1為各項變數之敘述性統計。另外，本研究採用 Pearson法來
計算各變數之相關係數，表 2 為計算結果，從表 2 中可發現，Pax-km/km 與
Ton-km/km具有負相關，也就是客運服務與貨運服務具有此消彼長的關係，另
外，Pax-km/km與 Fcar/km也具有負相關。值得一提的是 Pax-km/km與 Pcar/km 
具顯著正相關，相關係數 0.835，但 Ton-km/km 與 Fcar/km 雖具有正相關，但
其相關係數不高，也不顯著。

assume a distribution form for the inefficiency term; besides, SFA also needs to 
specify a functional form to represent the unknown production technology of the 
business or industry. 
 
Production function and cost function have long been used to represent the unknown 
production technology. The production function is in general used to properly 
elucidate a single-output technology. It requires only the amounts of output and inputs. 
On the other hand, the cost function can well depict the multiple-output multiple-input 
technology, but it requires such data as detailed input prices and the costs for each 
firm. It is a challenge to collect such detailed confidential price and cost data, 
especially in the international contexts subject to dynamic currency exchange rates. 
Another alternative that can deal with multiple-output multiple-input production 
technology is the distance function, which was originally introduced by Shephard [4] 
and extended by Färe and Primont [5]. Since then, the estimation of distance function 
has attracted increasing attention in the production economics. 
 
Classical maximum likelihood (ML) method was the most popular technique for 
estimating the parameters of stochastic frontier models and firm-specific inefficiency. 
It can be easily exercised with different computer software packages such as LIMDEP, 
SHAZAM, FRONTIER4.1, among others. However, ML method cannot produce 
prediction intervals for firm-specific or industry technical inefficiencies [6]. Moreover, 
ML method frequently violates the monotonicity, concavity, and convexity conditions 
implied by economic theory [7]. Once the estimated parameters of a distance function 
violate these regularity restrictions, it will lead to estimated elasticities that are 
incorrectly signed and ultimately to perverse conclusions [8]. Such perverse 
conclusions can be avoided by implementing Bayesian approach with the use of 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations [9]. The use of MCMC has become 
more and more popular due to the availability of inexpensive high-speed computers 
with the development of powerful computer-intensive statistical algorithms. These 
algorithms, for instance, the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, 
can be used to draw samples from a marginal probability density indirectly, without 
having to derive the density itself [7]. Consequently, the interest has been derected to 
the use of Bayesian approach for making inference in stochastic frontier models in 
recent years [10]. The Bayesian method has particular advantages in SFA contexts, 
including exact (small-sample) inference on inefficiencies, easy incorporation of prior 
ideas and restrictions (e.g., regularity conditions), and formal treatment of parameter 
and model uncertainty. For instance, Coelli et al. [6] pointed out that the use of 
Bayesian approach to inference has the following characteristics: 
(a) Estimators are chosen based on their ability to minimize the loss associated with

the subsection 2.4 introduces how to impose the regularity conditions on the specified 
output distance function. 
2.1 Stochastic Production Frontier Model 
To estimate firm-level efficiencies, we start from stochastic production frontier (SPF) 
model. Following Aigner et al. (1977), the SPF model can be defined as 
iiiiiii TEvxfuvxfy ´´=-´´= )exp();()exp()exp();( bb                   (1) 
where yi is the output of ith firm and vi is symmetric random error term. Aigner et al. 
(1977) assumed that vi follows a normal distribution with zero mean and constant 
variance and that ui is non-negative independently and identically distributed (iid) 
random variable, which captures technical inefficiency of firms. The technical 
efficiency of firms (TEi) is defined as 
N1,2i

i

)exp( =
´
=-=
b
                           (2) 
In order to estimate ui, one has to impose an appropriate distribution form (e.g. 
half-normal, truncated-normal, exponential, gamma, etc.) on the model. Since the 
truncated-normal distribution is the generalization of half-normal ones, and has been 
widely adopted by researchers, in this study we thus assume that the inefficiency term 
follows truncated-normal distribution. Following Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000), we 
assume that 
(a) vi ~ iid N (0, σv2); 
(b) ui ~ iid N+(μ, σu2); 
(c) vi and ui are distributed independently of each other, and of the regressors. 
With the assumptions that vi follows normal distribution, and ui is truncated normal 
distribution, their probability density functions can be written respectively as:

For any nonlinear function g (x), E [g (x)] is not equal to g (E [x]). In this case, 
Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) indicate that eq. (10) is preferred to eq. (9). 
2.2 Bayesian Analysis 
Bayesian analysis is based on Bayes theorem of probability. Suppose we wish to 
perform inference on a vector of model parameters, let p(y, θ) denote the joint 
probability density function for a random observation vector y and a vector of 
parameters θ, both vectors are random. Then, according to usual operations with 
probability density functions, we have

number of data can be easily accommodated. 
2.3 Output Distance Function  
Following Shephard (1970), Färe and Primont (1995), we assume that the production 
technology of a firm or an industry can be portrayed by the set expressed as: 
S = {(x, y): x can produce y}                                           (14) 
Assume that the production technology satisfies several standard axioms, including 
convexity, closedness, boundedness and strong disposability,. Färe and Primont (1995) 
have showed that the technology can also be described by either an input distance 
function or an output distance function. In this study we attempt to maximize 
railways’ service outputs while keeping given inputs, therefore an output distance 
function is preferred, which can be represented as: 
})/,(,0:min{),( SyxyxDo Î>= lll                                    (15) 
If (x, y) belongs to the production set S, then 1),( £yxDo , 1),( =yxDo  if and only if 
(x, y) locates on the frontier of the production set S. It should be noted that, based on 
the underlying theory of production economics, the assumptions imposed on the 
output distance function are non-decreasing, linearly homogeneous and convex in y, 
and non-increasing and quasi-convex in x. In other words, the estimated distance 
function has to satisfy prescribed monotonicity and curvature properties at each data 
point in the sample. As O’Donnell and Coelli (2005) pointed out that monotonicity 
violations will give rise to incorrectly signed elasticities, with the perverse implication 
that efficiency can be improved by increasing inputs while holding outputs fixed, and 
curvature violations will lead to the result that the production possibility frontiers are 
convex to the origin, implying the solutions to first-order conditions for revenue 
maximization will not be points of maximum revenue. These types of perverse results 
are obviously unsatisfactory. It is thus necessary to seek an effective method to 
impose the required regularity conditions on the parameters of an estimated translog 
output distance function.  
Since the translog functional form can provide a second-order approximation to any 
arbitrary functional form, based some previous studies, the translog output distance 
function that represents the production technology of railways’ services involving M 
outputs and R inputs is specified as follows:

the frontier) may be due to either inefficiency or noise, after introducing a symmetric 
error term, v, to represent the statistical noise, the resulting empirical output distance 
function becomes: 
uvyTLy MM -+=- )),/,(ln φyx                                        (24) 
This is the standard stochastic frontier model described in Subsection 2.1. Thus our 
objective is concentrated on estimating parameters of the models in such a way that 
the estimated functions satisfy the regularity conditions implied by the theory of 
production economics. 
2.4 Imposing Regularity Conditions 
As mentioned in previous Subsection, the estimated distance function has to satisfy 
monotonicity and curvature properties at each data point in the sample. In other words, 
the output distance function, D, is non-decreasing in y, and non-increasing in x. For D 
to be non-decreasing in y, we require:

proxy of capital), and the number of cars (sum of freight wagons and coach cars) as 
the input variables (for example, Coelli and Perelman, 1999; Cowie, 1999). As for the 
output variables, we separate the passenger-kilometers from ton-kilometers. 
For simplicity, we do not account for such external factors as public/private 
ownership and regulatory differences across the firms. In sum, our data set contains 
five-variable data, including two output variables—passenger-kilometers (yp) and 
ton-kilometers (yf)) and three input variables—number of employees (x1), length of 
lines (x2), and number of cars (x3). Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the 
data.

3.2 Model specification 
We firstly investigate the correlations for each pair of variables; the results are 
displayed in Table 2. As indicated in Table 2, the number of cars is the most highly 
correlative with the number of employees as well as with the length of line, it is thus 
reasonably suspected that multicollinearity is likely existent in the estimation. Hence, 
we perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, respectively, with two and 
three input variables; namely, two log-linear output distance functions with two and 
three input variables. The estimation results are indicated in Table 3, from which we 
note that the coefficient of third input variable—the number of cars is statistically 
insignificant (P>0.05). Moreover, its incorrect (negative) sign implies that more input 
would lead to higher efficiency, violating the monotonicity implied by the economic 
regularity. Hence, in the following model specification and estimation, this variable 
(number of cars) will be discarded.

* indicates significant (P<0.05). 
3.3 The Estimated Results  
For comparison, we firstly estimate the parameters of the above-specified translog 
output distance function with the classical ML method by using the computer program 
FRONTIER 4.1 developed by Coelli (1996); the detailed results are displayed in 
Table 4 (parameters) and Appendix (efficiencies). As can be seen from Table 4, all of 
the major coefficients (the linear terms) are significant (P<0.05) with an exception of 
β2. Positive coefficients in the terms of yp and yf imply that the specified output 
distance function satisfies the condition of non-decreasing in y, and the negative sign 
in the input term (β3) indicates that the specified output distance function also satisfies 
the condition of non-increasing in x. However, the positive sign in the labor factor (β2) 
suggests that more input factors will lead to higher efficiency, violating the regularity 
of economics, which also shows the shortcoming of ML method. 
Next, we further estimate the parameters and firm-specific technical efficiencies with 
Bayesian analysis by using the computer program WinBUGS developed by 
Spiegelhater et al. (2003). In Bayesian estimation, the aforementioned restricted 
conditions are imposed on the model. It should be noted, however, that when using 
MCMC simulation, it is sometimes difficult to conclude that a chain (simulation) has 
converged. As a rule of thumb, the simulations can terminate when the Monte Carlo 
error for each parameter of interest (include the efficiency for each firm) is less than 
5% of the sample standard deviation. In our case, we generated a total of 400,000 
observations and then discarded the first 100,000 as a “burn-in;” the results are also 
indicated in Table 4 (parameters) and Appendix (efficiencies). In addition to mean, 
the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the MCMC sample observations are also reported.

where y* = yp / yf. 
3.4 Discussion  
By substituting the observation data into the first derivatives, we obtain the average 
elasticity associated with each variable; the results are displayed in Table 5. From 
Table 5, it is found that all the average elasticities with respect to input and output 
variables have correct signs regardless of which methods being employed. Noted from 
Appendix, however, that seven DMUs estimated by ML method are incorrectly 
signed (positive)—six DMUs in the elasticity for input x1 and one for input x2; in 
contrast, none have incorrect signs when estimated by Bayesian analysis. Again, it 
demonstrates that the Bayesian analysis is superior to the classical ML method.

Ton-kilometers 0.391 0.398 
No. of employees -0.452 -0.461 
Length of lines -0.752 -0.795 
Furthermore, we note from Appendix that the efficiencies estimated by ML method 
are generally lower than those by Bayesian analysis. We also note that the Bayesian 
estimates tend to exhibit less variation (0.014) across the firms than the ML estimates 
(0.134). Basically, our results are consistent with the findings by O’Donnell and 
Coelli (2005). 
4.  Concluding Remarks 
The specification of stochastic distance functions has been widely used in the 
measurement of technical efficiency and productivity growth in production economics 
due to the advantages of suitable for depicting the multiple-input multiple-output 
production technologies and of no bother collecting confidential input/output price 
(cost) information. However, using the classical maximum likelihood (ML) method to 
estimate the distance functions would probably generate undesired results, which 
oftentimes violate the regularity restrictions implied by economic theory and thus lead
