Chapter 1 Introduction 
The operation frequencies for the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n are one of the most crowded bands in 
wireless communications since they are unlicensed by any international agreement or government 
authority.  Therefore, efficiently utilizing the limited spectrum in such bands is very crucial and 
indispensable.  Many solutions in relative fields have been proposed or under development.  The 
pattern diversity antenna is a good candidate to solve the problem and mitigate the multi-path effects 
[1]-[12].  Its radiation pattern can be shaped to concentrate the energy to the directions of targets 
and minimize the gain in unwanted directions.  Generally, an omni-directional pattern is also 
provided to communicate in all directions.  The most suitable pattern can be configured on demand 
with the pattern reconfigurable antenna. 
Numerous pattern reconfigurable antennas are stemmed from the variations of the Yagi-Uda 
antenna [4]-[8].  When the length of the parasitic element is shorter than that of the active element, 
a pulling pattern is obtained.  On the other hand, if the length of the parasitic one is longer than that 
of the active element, a pushing pattern is formed.  Therefore, different arrangements of parasitic 
elements with different lengths around the active element yield different radiation patterns. This 
offers a simple and flexible method for beam-forming. 
Another way to construct pattern reconfigurable antennas is using the switched arrays [9]-[12].  
A phased array can change the main beam direction by appropriately adjusting the feeding phases of 
the active elements.  In [11], adequate phases to the antennas are accomplished by shifting the 
feeding point of the power divider.  The main beam direction varies with frequencies because the 
phase differences between paths change with frequencies.  Whereas in [12], the distribution of 
phase angles at each port of the feeding network can be altered by moving the metal coated slab.  
Other than these two types of reconfigurable antennas, a radiation pattern diversity antenna, which 
combines the concept of the reconfigurable frequency selective reflector (RFSR) and the right angle 
corner reflector antenna [13], was devised by the authors recently. 
The above-mentioned pattern reconfigurable antennas are available only in single band, and the 
sizes are comparatively large.  In this work, a single-band pattern reconfigurable antenna based on 
a different principle is first proposed.  This antenna, which evolved from the corner reflector 
antenna, has four rectangular plates standing erect on the ground plane and enclosing the substrate 
backed strip monopole in the center.  Each rectangular plate is a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) 
with two loop elements, whose transmission/reflection characteristic is designed to be controlled by 
one switching device.  That is, only four switches are enough for configuring the reflection states 
of the four side walls of the proposed 90o corner reflector antenna, so as to adaptively form the 
radiation patterns.  The switching circuitry, bias lines, and impedance matching networks of this 
antenna are hidden beneath the ground plane, which can avoid the undesired electromagnetic 
interactions.  In addition, this antenna features beam tilting property, which can reduce the

Chapter 2 Design of the Pattern 
Reconfigurable Antenna 
The pattern reconfigurable reflector antenna, as shown in Fig. 1, comprises a feeding monopole 
antenna in the center, four rectangular plates on the sidewalls of the square corner reflector antenna, 
and a finite square ground plane on which the former elements are mounted.  Planar reconfigurable 
FSS is applied to implement the rectangular plates on the sidewalls.  The transmission and 
reflection property of the FSS can be controlled by changing the switch state.  For one state the FSS 
plate acts as a reflector, while for the other state it is transparent to the waves from/to the feed 
antenna.  Four switches (A, B, C and D) connecting the FSS elements and the ground plane are 
located on the four sides respectively.  The pattern of a corner reflector antenna varies with the 
number and the arrangement of the reflectors.  With various combinations of the switch states, 
multiple patterns can thus be formed.  The ground plane was made on the top surface of an FR4 
substrate.  The matching circuit was printed on the other side of the substrate, and prior to that, the 
impedance of the fabricated antenna had been measured.  In the proposed antenna configuration, the 
switches and their associated circuitry, e.g. the bias lines, are designed to be placed behind the 
ground plane but not within the region where electromagnetic waves propagate.  This arrangement 
minimizes the adverse influence caused by the undesired yet necessary presence of those elements.

Researches on both the underlying theories and practices of many FSS element geometries 
have been well established [17]-[19].  Square loop FSS element is the one having simple and 
effective structure.  It has a relatively wide frequency bandwidth, and its resonant frequency is 
fairly stable with respect to changes in incident angle and polarization.  Besides, the reflection 
phase curves of the square loop structures are less sensitive to oblique incidence [20]-[22]. 
In virtue of its symmetric geometry, the FSS with square loop elements works well for circular 
polarization waves.  Nonetheless, the feed monopole is a linear polarization antenna.  That means 
the width and length of the loop have not to be the same; there are more degrees of freedom in design 
to fit the FSS structures into the reflector plates of the corner reflector antenna at the same time 
maintain good performance.  Therefore this type of element, more exactly the rectangular loop, was 
adopted for this work. 
As shown in Fig. 1Figure , two shunt rectangular loop FSS elements are printed on a 120 mm × 
40 mm FR4 substrate with thickness of 0.8 mm.  A printed metallic line with a total length of about 
a half wavelength is created to connect these two rectangular loops.  The FSS elements are designed 
such that whose current distributions change significantly with the switching state and hence there 
would be a conspicuously difference in the frequency response. 
When the incident waves impinge on them, two equal amplitude and in-phase voltages are 
produced at the two ends of the metallic line.  By symmetry, the line appears open circuited at its 
midpoint.  This open circuit then causes short circuits at the two ends of the line when transformed 
back through the quarter-wavelength line segment.  The rectangular loops are thus out of resonance 
because the induced current distributions are altered by the connection of the line and the rectangular 
loops, so that the input waves will pass through the surface almost uninhibitedly.  On the other hand, 
if the midpoint of the metallic line is shorted to the ground, both ends of the metallic line appear to 
be open circuited due to quarter-wavelength transformations, i.e., the presence of the metallic line 
does not disturb the geometrical resonances of the rectangular loops, and the incident waves will be 
reflected back. 
  7
respectively.  The total length of the printed metallic line is 64 mm, and the width of the line which 
yields no significant effect on the electrical length is 1 mm.  The gap between the metallic line and 
the ground plane is 0.5 mm.  However, the width of the loop (Wloop) is an important parameter.  A 
greater Wloop results in a wider transmission bandwidth and tends to resonate at higher frequency for 
the on-state, while the reflection curves scarcely vary with Wloop for the off-state, as shown in Fig. 3.  
Wloop is determined to be 2.5 mm such that this design is opaque (transmission coefficient= –16.4 dB) 
in the on-state and transparent (reflection coefficient= –23.9 dB) in the off-state at 2.45 GHz. 
Ideally, the proposed method can be extended to simultaneously control the switching states of 
a group of microwave elements with one switch, especially for periodic structures like FSSs, by 
properly arranging the positions of the elements and the electrical lengths of the transmission lines 
between them.  Fig. 4 diagrams an example that can switch all the FSS elements to the same state 
synchronously.

Chapter 3 Design of the Dual-Band Pattern 
Reconfigurable Antenna 
3-1 Antenna Configuration 
The proposed dual-band pattern reconfigurable antenna by the RFSRs is shown in Fig. 5.  It 
consists of a dual-band feeding antenna in the center, four dual-band RFSRs on the side walls, and a 
finite square ground plate on which the feeding antenna and RFSRs are perpendicularly mounted.  
Each dual-band RFSR has two groups of rectangular loops.  The transmission and reflection 
properties of the RFSRs are controlled by four switches, S1~S4.  In one switch state, both groups of 
rectangular loops are at resonance when excited by vertically polarized incident waves at the two 
resonant frequencies, and thus the waves will be reflected.  In the other switch state, those 
rectangular loops are out of resonance, so they are transparent to waves.  Only one switch is needed 
for each dual-band reflector.   Multiple radiation patterns can be achieved according to the 
combinations of the switch states.

The current distributions on these loops change significantly with the switch states, so their 
frequency responses are quite different in different switch states. Initially, consider only the center 
large loop and the side loop, but without the short vertical lines and the horizontal transmission line, 
as shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b).  Because of the symmetry in geometry and the 1　 perimeter, 
when vertically polarized plane waves at resonant frequencies impinge on the loops, current nulls 
appear at the midpoints of the top and bottom horizontal segments of the loops, and strong in-phase 
currents occur at the midpoints of the vertical segments.  Then, the re-radiated fields excited from 
the induced currents would cancel the incoming waves at the backside of the reflector while generate 
a wave propagating toward the opposite direction.  Hence, the RFSR structures reflect the incident 
waves back. 
Next, consider the existence of the transmission line and the vertical short lines.  In Fig. 8(c), 
the end point b of the central short line connecting the bottom middle point of the center large loop is 
open circuited if the switch is off.  When a vertically polarized plane wave at 2.45 GHz is incident 
on the center large loop, the open-circuit condition extends to the bottom middle point of the center 
loop because the length of the vertical line is relatively short compared with the wavelength of 2.45 
GHz.  As a result, the resonant current distribution excited by the incident wave remains as the one 
without the transmission line, and the incident waves will be reflected.  In order to minimize the 
number of switches, we built a mechanism to configure the two groups of rectangular loops in the 
same state with one switch.  When a vertically polarized wave at 5.25 GHz is incident, due to the 
geometrical symmetry of the horizontal transmission line, an open circuit appears at the midpoint of 
this line when the switch is off.  On the purpose of generating open circuits at both ends of the 
horizontal line, a 1　-long transmission line at 5.25 GHz is required. According to the transmission 
line theory, the open circuit condition will show at the two ends of the line through the 
half-wavelength transformation at each side. As a result, the resonant current distribution excited by 
5.25 GHz vertically polarized incident waves remains the same as the one without the transmission 
line, and incident waves will  be reflected. The induced currents on the side small loops remain 
resonant, as shown in Fig. 8(d).  Consequently, the RFSR is reflective at both 2.45 GHz and 5.25 
GHz when the switch is off.  
On the other hand, when the switch is on, the end of the central short line and the midpoint of 
the horizontal transmission line is short-circuited to ground.  Nearly short-circuit conditions show at 
the bottom middle point of the center loop and at both ends of the horizontal line, which thus destroy 
the resonance requirement for both two types of loops.  As shown in Fig. 8(e) and Fig. 8(f), the 
induced currents will become weak and out of resonance, so that the re-radiated fields can be ignored. 
Consequently, the incoming waves will pass through the RFSR.  In short, in the “On-state” of the 
switch, a vertically polarized incident wave will be reflected by the RFSR, and in the “Off-state”, the 
wave will pass through the RFSR.  The full-wave electromagnetic software Ansoft HFSS was 
employed to analyze this dual-band RFSR.

Fig. 12.  The simulated Off-state transmission coefficients for various L1. 
With the above observations and the consideration of the 　/2 transmission line for 5.25 GHz, 
(Hlp1, Tlp1) for the center large loop are determined to be (4.5 mm, 2 mm), and (Hlp2, Tlp2, Ll) for the 
side small loop are (6 mm, 2 mm, 17 mm).  The simulated transmission coefficients of the finalized 
RFSR are shown in Fig. 13.  The transmission coefficients at both frequencies in On-state are 
higher than -3 dB while those in Off-state are lower than -10 dB.  Note that ‘On-state’ means that 
the switch is on while  ‘Off-state’ indicates the switch is off. Good transmission in On-state and 
good reflection in Off-state are achieved for both 2.45 GHz and 5.25 GHz frequency bands. It is 
noticed that due to the leakage of the incident wave at the radiation boundaries, the transmission 
coefficients in On-state would not reach 0 dB. The maximum values happen at the two operation 
bands, which are -2.5 dB and -3 dB for the lower and higher bands, respectively. The simulated 
current distributions in On- and Off-state at 2.45 GHz and 5.25 GHz are shown in Fig. 14.  The 
induced currents in Off-state are much stronger than that in On-state, even though the opens do not 
exactly occur at the connecting points due to the coupling effect [13]. However, the main  current 
distribution remains as the one without the transmission lines, and thus the reflective effects on a 
vertically polarized incident wave in Off-state still remain. 
One important thing should be noted is that large loop should not be directly connected to the 
horizontal transmission line when the switch is off.  Otherwise the center large loop provides a 
grounding condition at the midpoint (point a) of the horizontal transmission line because it’s 
comparatively large for a 5.25 GHz incident wave.  This grounding condition will in turn appear at 
the two ends of the transmission line, and thus destroys the resonance requirement for the small 
loops at 5.25 GHz. Fig. 15 shows the current distribution and the transmission coefficient of the 
RFSR when the large loop is directly connected to the midpoint of the horizontal transmission line. It 
is observed that the currents are mainly distributed along the transmission line. Only negligible 
currents appear at the loops. It is also found from Fig. 15(b) that under this condition, the RFSR no 
longer reflects the 5.25 GHz incident wave. Thus, a double-pole-double-throw (DPDT) switch is 
applied to accommodate the necessary current separation between the two transmission lines when in

3-2-3 Dual-band feeding antenna 
A dual-band feeding antenna that is less sensitive to the environment is required to maintain 
good impedance matching in different surrounding conditions caused by the combinations of the 
reflection states of the sidewalls. It is hard to use impedance matching network to satisfy the various 
radiating conditions at two frequencies. In this paper, the lower resonant frequency of the dual-band 
feeding antenna is designed to be excited by couplings, which is more insusceptible to the 
surroundings than by conventional direct feeding method [27]. 
The proposed dual-band feeding antenna is shown in Fig. 16.  It has two parts printed on both 
sides of a 0.8-mm-thick, 30-mm-wide and 40-mm-long FR4 substrate.  The front part directly 
excites the higher frequency radiation while the back part combined with the former by coupling 
effects resonates at the lower frequency.  The suitable amount of coupling can be obtained by 
adjusting wf, h and g2.  The optimized geometry parameters are as follows: h= 2 mm, ht1= 1.5 mm,

Chapter 4 Measurement Results 
4-1 Measurement results of the singlel-band pattern reconfigurable 
antenna 
The photograph of the finished antenna is shown in Fig. 18.  Patterns with different shapes 
and orientations can be achieved by various combinations of the switch states.  Due to the 
symmetry of the antenna architecture, there are six fundamental cases.  The definitions and their 
corresponding antenna parameters are listed in Table I, where 0 stands for switch off and 1 for switch 
on.  The on and off states are realized by directly soldering the middle point of the metallic line to 
the ground plane and de-soldering respectively.  Since Case 3 provides the maximum peak gain, the 
impedance of Case 3 was measured, and then the matching circuit was designed and implemented.  
Fig. 19 shows the measured return losses for the six cases against frequency.  It can be seen that 
the –10 dB bandwidth for Case 3 is from 2.09 GHz to 2.57 GHz (about 19.6%).  The narrowest 
bandwidth occurs for Case 1, which is 0.2 GHz.  The bandwidths of the other cases cover at least 
2.19-2.50 GHz. 
Fig. 20 to Fig. 24 display the measured co-polarization patterns for different cases at the 2.45 GHz.  
Obviously, the patterns are apt to be directional with their main lobes pointed toward the orientation 
where the switch states are off.  When the switches are all on or all off, the pattern is basically 
omni-directional.  The pattern of Case 4 is bidirectional because two of the switches on the opposite 
sides are in the same state and vice versa.  Case 2, 3 and 5 have directional patterns while Case 3 
produces the maximum gain, as can be expected from the simulations.  For Case 3, the measured 
patterns agree well with the simulated ones in the main beam region, whereas with dissimilar 
side-lobes.  The peak gain of 5.99 dBi was measured at (　=45o, 　= 225o).  The measured 
side-lobe level and half power beam width in 　= 225o plane are 12.17 dB and 52o respectively.

Fig. 26 shows the measured return losses of Case 1 and Case 2. In both two cases, the in-band 
return losses are better than 10 dB, except for the lower band in Case 1 which is still better than 8 dB. 
It may result from the fabricating error at the antenna-feeding point. However, we still can conclude 
that the resonant frequencies do not endure severe mismatch in the merit of feeding by coupling 
effects when the switch states changes. The measured radiation patterns of Case 1 and Case 2 at 2.55 
GHz and 5.25 GHz are shown in Fig. 27 and Fig. 28, respectively.  In Case 1 (Fig. 27), the 
maximum gain at 2.55 GHz of 3.54 dBi was measured at 　= 45o and 　 = 65o, and that at 5.25 GHz 
is 7.77 dBi at 　 = 45o and 　 = 30o.  The front-to-back ratio at 2.5 GHz is 8.31 dBi, and is 9.74 at 
5.25 GHz. Therefore, good directivity can be achieved in Case 1. Whereas for Case 2, good 
omni-directional patterns are observed within 0o < 　 < 60o. The shape of the omni-directional 
pattern is conical above the ground plane in three-dimension space.
