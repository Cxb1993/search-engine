or numerical solutions to the electric double layer 
potential, pressure distribution, induced electric 
field distribution, effective viscosity distribution, 
and the flow velocity distribution of the power-law 
diffusioosmotic flow can be obtained. Results from 
further parametric studies show that the rheological 
behavior and flow characteristics of non-Newtonian 
power-law diffusioosmotic flow are very much 
different from those of Newtonian diffusioosmotic 
flow. This suggests that not only the differences in 
the respective ionic species diffusivities and the 
interfacial zeta potential, but also the rheological 
characteristics or behavior of the carrier 
electrolytic liquid phase are important to the 
pratical implementation or operation of 
diffusioosmotic flows or particle diffusiophoresis in 
micro total analysis systems. The theoretical model 
for non-Newtonian power-law diffusioosmotic flow 
developed herein can be further extended and modified 
to describe non-Newtonian power-law 
electrodiffusioosmotic flow in systems where all the 
factors of the liquid rheology, imposed concentration 
gradient of ionic species, and an externally applied 
electric current density are of equal importance and 
have to treated simultaneously.

1. Introduction 
      Researchers working on designing, implementing, and operating micro total analysis systems ( TAS) 
or “Lab-on-a-Chip” (LoC) systems are often faced with two commonly encountered situations and technical 
challenges, they are: (i) the liquids or fluids frequently processed in these systems or devices are mostly 
biological or complex fluids and cannot be described by the Newtonian fluid constitutive model [1-8] and (ii) 
large concentration gradients of the solute ionic species are usually present in the micro flow channels of these 
systems due to concentration polarization [9-11] or pre-concentration of mass samples before further 
separation analyses [12-13], and thus may induce additional diffusioosmotic flow [14-27] during analytical 
chemical operation. Therefore, it is generally of interest and of crucial importance to understand the 
fundamental physics and flow phenomena of non-Newtonian diffusioosmotic flow in microfluidic systems 
such that experimental setup and measurement data can respectively be properly designed and well interpreted 
for this combined microfluidic phenomenon, and that fundamental theory can be developed to further predict 
the flow and rheological behavior during the implementation and operation of these systems. 
      Although much has been done, both theoretically and experimentally, in investigating the 
electrokinetic electroosmotic flow of non-Newtonian liquids in microfluidic systems [1-8] and in 
understanding the diffusioosmotic flow and particle diffusiophoresis phenomenon in Newtonian liquids 
[1,14-27], the two aspects of non-Newtonian rheological response and diffusioosmosis are, up to this point 
and to the best of our knowledge, never combined together such that a fundamental theory describing the 
diffusioosmotic flow of non-Newtonian liquids in micro colloidal systems can be developed. Hence the 
primary goal of the present research is to formulate a theoretical mathematical and physical model that can be 
used to describe or analyze the dynamics and response of diffusioosmotic flows of non-Newtonian fluids 
induced by concentration gradients present in the micro/nano-fluidic flow channels of micro total analysis or 
Lab-on-a-Chip systems. Moreover, in addition to the imposed concentration gradient of ionic solute species 
present in the microfluidic flow channels, an externally applied electric field or electric current density is also 
present and of equal importance as compared to the imposed concentration gradient in practical 
electrochemical systems and concentration polarization experiments [1,9-11,28,29]. The fluid flow driven by 
the combined action of both an imposed ionic solute concentration gradient and an externally applied electric 
current density is termed electrodiffusioosmotic flow [1,28,29]. We show that the present theory developed for 
describing diffusioosmotic flow of non-Newtonian liquids can be easily extended and modified to further 
model and describe the rheological response and flow behavior of electrodiffusioosmosis of non-Newtonian 
liquids [1]. 
      The results of this research not only present a first theoretical model describing the flow phenomenon 
of non-Newtonian diffusioosmosis, but also offer a first approach in the theoretical development of 
non-Newtonian electrodiffusioosmotic flow dynamics for electrochemical and concentration polarization 
applications. 
 
2. Formulation and solutions 
      Illustrated in Fig. 1 is the schematic diagram showing the two-dimensional geometry, coordinate 
system, and relevant physical parameters of the Ostwald-de Waele power-law (OWPL) diffusioosmotic flow 
considered herein. It can be seen that a long solid flat plate of characteristic length L  is in contact with an 
 6
which is subjected to the boundary conditions of  0y   w    ,  y    0    , 
and   0y y    , where      , ,x y x y x    ,   is the electric permittivity of the liquid, 
and   is the characteristic zeta potential for the solid-liquid interface [1,14,16,21,22]. On the other hand, the 
governing equations describing the mass and momentum balances of the fluid flow are respectively the 
continuity equation, 
0u  , and                                                                           (3) 
the Cauchy momentum principle including the Coulomb force term, i.e., 
                      ,                                                               (4) 
in which D Dt  is the material derivative, u  is the flow velocity field,   is the liquid density, p  is the 
pressure field, and x x y yE E i E i   is the electric field. Using the assumptions made above, we can combine 
Eqs. (1)-(4) and simplify the full governing equations into the following:

The boundary conditions on the stress and flow velocity fields for steady state OWPL diffusioosmotic flows 
are given as 0yx   as y   and 0xu   at 0y  , respectively [1,14,16,21,22]. 
      By solving Eqs. (5)-(7), solutions to the electric double layer potential, pressure distribution, induced 
electric field, and shear stress can be respectively obtained as:

      The theoretical development and mathematical solutions describing the diffusioosmotic flow of 
Ostwald-de Waele, power-law, fluids near a large charged flat plate can be extended and modified to describe 
the electrodiffusioosmotic flow of power-law liquids near a charged flat plate when both an imposed ionic 
solute concentration gradient and an externally applied electric current density are present in the colloidal 
microfluidic system [1,28,29]. This is easily done by replacing the induced electric field, Eq. (10), with an 
electric current density modulated induced electric field, i.e., 
                                        ,                                            (18) 
 
where xfJ   is the externally applied electric current density, and substituting all the diffusivity difference 
parameter,  , found in Eqs. (11)-(17) with the electric current density modulated diffusivity difference 
parameter, i.e., 
                              .                                                      (19) 
 
Since the conversion between the diffusioosmosis and electrodiffusioosmosis analyses is relatively straight 
forward, the subsequent results and discussions apply to both diffusioosmotic and electrodiffusioosmotic flow 
of power-law liquids in colloidal microfluidic systems. 
 
3. Results and discussions 
Figure 4 shows the dimensionless OWPL diffusioosmotic flow velocity profiles, *u  or Eqs. (13), (15), 
and (17), plotted with respect to the dimensionless spatial y -coordinate evaluated at flow behavior indices 
of n  0.4, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 for the    parametric pairs of 0.1    (V ) and 1    (corresponding 
to Case (I)) in Fig. 4a, 0.1    (V ) and 0.2    (corresponding to Case (II)) in Fig. 4b, and 0.1    
(V ) and 1    (corresponding to Case (III)) in Fig. 4c. We now further describe the physical meanings of 
the respective three solution categories or cases as identified in our previous discussions using the velocity 
distributions shown in Fig. 4. 
      Case (I) in Fig. 4a is represented by, for example, a negatively charged wall ( 0.1    (V )) with the 
anions having a much greater diffusivity as compared to that of the cations, i.e., 
  ' 1 ln

this particular parametric regime, the dilatant liquid velocity profiles first increase in magnitude (forward flow 
in positive x-direction) as the y -coordinate increases from 0y   up to the zero stress point of y  , 
which for the condition of 0.1    (V ) and 0.2   ,   roughly equals to 1.32. As we move further into 
the bulk liquid and away from the zero stress point, the flow velocity of the dilatant liquid decreases and may 
eventually reverse in direction (i.e., negative x-direction) for large enough flow behavior indices as can be 
seen for the 2.5n   and 5 velocity profiles found in the figure. Furthermore, the amount of forward flow 
towards the positive x-direction, or downstream, in the vicinity of the wall is influenced by the wall zeta 
potential and the strength or magnitude of the diffusivity difference parameter,  , for a dilatant liquid with a 
specified flow behavior index. Having large enough flow behavior indices in Fig. 4b, e.g., 5n  , a cusp 
structure at the zero stress point,  , of dilatant flow velocity profiles can also be identified, which is a result 
similar to those found at the center of pressure driven power law liquid circular pipe flows [1,31]. Lastly, the 
1n   (Newtonian) and 1n   (pseudoplastic) velocity profiles are generally flat and relatively small in 
magnitude as compared to those of the 1n   (dilatant) solutions for small to moderate wall zeta potentials in 
this solution category. 
      As for the Case (III) solutions presented in Fig. 4c, the situation is represented by a negatively charged 
wall with the diffusivity of the cation being much greater than that of the anion or a positively charged wall 
with D D  . Given a negatively charged solid wall, i.e., 0.1    (V ), the diffuse part of the EDL is 
dominated by cations, and with D D   or       1D D D D       in the bulk electrolyte, the 
direction of the induced electric field, ixE  or Eq. (10), and the subsequent electroosmotic flow is opposite to 
that of the pressure driven flow, which is similar to the situation discussed in Case (II). Note however that the 
strength of the induced electric field as well as the electroosmotic flow for Case (III) is now much greater than 
those found in Case (II), and thus the electroosmotic forces likely dominate over the osmotic pressure forces 
leading to reverse flow velocities in the vicinity of the solid-liquid interface. This result is readily seen in Fig. 
4c with the dimensionless velocity profiles, *u , being negatively valued, i.e., flow being reversed or towards 
upstream, throughout the spatial domain. Similar to Fig. 4b, it can also be found in Fig. 4c that the velocity 
profiles of 1n   (pseudoplastic) liquids are generally flat and small in magnitude as compared to those of 
1n   (Newtonian) and 1n   (dilatant) liquids for this particular parametric regime of interest. 
 12
the *   plane is also a solution that makes *u  equal to zero in Fig. 6. Notice that Fig. 6 explores the far 
field OWPL diffusioosmotic flow velocities in the whole *   plane. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the 
* 0   line together with the *   boarder curve for each type of the three liquids divide the whole 
*   plane into four quadrants in which the far field OWPL diffusioosmotic flow velocity, *u , flows 
towards either downstream or upstream. Generally speaking, the top right and bottom left quadrants represent 
the situation of *u  flowing towards downstream, and the top left and bottom right quadrants represent the 
situation of *u  flowing towards upstream. By comparing the three boarder curves obtained for the respective 
dilatant ( 2.5n  ), Newtonian ( 1n  ), and pseudoplastic ( 0.5n  ) liquids in Fig. 6, it can be found that the 
size or area of the “ *u  to downstream” quadrants is reduced for the 2.5n   (dilatant) solution and is 
increased for the 0.5n   (pseudoplastic) solution as compared to the Newtonian solution; in other words, the 
size or area of the “ *u  to upstream” quadrants is increased and decreased for the respective 2.5n   
(dilatant) and 0.5n   (pseudoplastic) solutions as compared to the Newtonian solution. 
 
Summarizing the findings from this research, we find that both the near and far field OWPL 
diffusioosmotic flow velocities of the respective dilatant and pseudoplastic liquids are much different or 
considerably deviate from those of Newtonian liquids—the differences in flow responses among the three 
different flow regimes are likely to be amplified or reduced by the nonlinear characteristics of the OWPL 
model depending on the wall zeta potential,  , diffusivity difference parameter,  , and the flow behavior 
index, n , as compared to the Newtonian model. This suggests that not only the differences in the respective 
ionic species diffusivities and the interfacial zeta potential, but also the rheological characteristics or behavior 
of the carrier electrolytic liquid phase are important to the pratical implementation or operation of 
diffusioosmotic flows or particle diffusiophoresis in micro total analysis systems.

Figure 3. Based on the different choices of the    parametric pair, and referring to the variations of shear 
stress with respect to the spatial coordinate as shown in Fig. 2, we can categorize the solutions to the 
power-law diffusioosmotic flow into three cases, namely, Case (I) with *  being all positive, Case 
(II) with *  having z zero stress point within the domain of 0 y   , and Case (III) with *  
being all negative.
