Introduction 
Chemical mechanical planarization or polishing (CMP) is a technology that can enable the 
continued adherence to Moore’s Law, which requires a geometrical increase in feature (e.g., 
transistor) density on semiconductor chips [1]. It is well known that CMP can serve as one of the 
most effective methods for local and global planarization. CMP is achieved by polishing wafers 
against a rotating polyurethane pad. The slurry that permeates the pad top contains submicron-sized 
abrasives, and reaction chemicals will gradually consume the wafer surface. The main components 
of the CMP process are the slurry, pad, diamond conditioner, clean equipment, and end-point 
detector. Among these components, the slurry plays a vital role in terms of removing material and 
ensuring the high surface quality of the polished wafers. The polishing pad significantly affects the 
polishing results, including aspects such as wafer material removal and uniformity. The diamond 
conditioner is employed periodically and continually—either for in-situ dressing, in which 
conditioning is performed while the wafers are being polished, or for ex-situ dressing, in which 
conditioning is performed after the wafers have been polished—to regenerate the asperity structure 
of the pad, remove the reaction product, and extend the pad life [2–3].  
Previous studies have focused on the design of the CMP polishing pad. Kim et al. [4] studied 
an encapsulated abrasive pad and pointed out that the removal rate when using the encapsulated 
abrasive pad appeared to be about 30% higher than that when using the slurry and polyurethane pad 
in the general CMP process. Using a fixed abrasive pad, in which abrasives are embedded on the

2.1. Experimental apparatus 
Dressing experiments were performed using a polishing pad mounted on a commercially modified, 
variable-speed polishing machine with variable speed. The diamond conditioner was attached to a 
holder that was connected to a head rotating at 10 rpm. A polyurethane pad was mounted on a table 
disk that rotated at a speed of 40 rpm. The applied load was fixed at approximately 3 kg. After the 
pad was dressed, its surface topology was measured using a stylus-type instrument for 
three-dimensional surface roughness measurement. The radius of the diamond tip probe, nose angle, 
and measuring force were 5 μm, 90°, and 4 mN, respectively. Each image was captured with over 
50 scan curves and 20000 points within a 1 mm × 1 mm area of the pad. The roughness values used 
in the next section are the averages of three measured values. The measured roughness data have 
approximately the same reliability as the statistically averaged value of 50 measurements. A 
scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to examine the morphological features of the 
pad, such as pores and grooves. The pad dressing rate was measured using a linear variable 
differential transformer (LVDT) instrument. The friction force, values of which are used in the next 
section, can be measured using a torque dynamometer and a computer data acquisition system. 
The polishing experiments were conducted using a Westech polisher (Model 372M) as shown 
in Fig. 1. The polishing speed is adjustable, and the pad was mounted on a polishing plate with a 
diameter of 24 inches. During the polishing process, a power head applies a specific load to the 
wafer and a dispenser is used to supply the slurry. The wafer used was an oxide wafer with a 
thickness of 8000 Å, and the dimension of wafer was 6 inches. The wafer was attached to a holder 
that was connected to a wafer carrier head rotating at 40 rpm. A polyurethane pad was mounted on a 
table disk rotating at 42 rpm. The applied pressure was about 4 psi. The polishing slurry used in the 
experiments was SS25 (Cobat Co.). The thickness of the oxide layer on the wafers was measured 
before and after polishing using a system that is commonly applied to measure the thickness of thin 
films, with a measurement range of 100 to 150,000 Å. The data reported in this study are obtained

The variation in the dressing rate of the graphite impregnated pad and porous pad is shown in 
Fig. 5. The dressing rate is one of the most important factors that affects the surface condition and 
cost of the pad. It is defined as the amount of material that is removed from the pad surface per unit 
time and is calculated as the decrease in the pad thickness divided by the dressing time (unit: μm/hr). 
The dressing rate of the graphite impregnated pad (approximately 41 μm/hr) is markedly lower than 
that of the porous pad (approximately 66 μm/hr). This implies that if the graphite impregnated pad 
is used, less pad material will be consumed and, consequently, the pad life will be extended. As a 
result, a reduction in the cost associated with the CMP process can be expected. Figure 5 also shows 
the variation in wafer removal rate (WRR) for different pads at a slurry flow rate of 50 ml/min. The 
WRR is defined as the decrease in wafer thickness per unit time. The removal rate of the oxidized 
wafer when the graphite impregnated pad is used (about 1450 Å/min) exceeds that when the porous 
pad is used (about 1300 Å /min). Dioxide polishing typically proceeds with the formation of a 
hydrated layer (Si(OH)4) by means of a chemical reaction. This hydrated layer is removed by the 
abrasive particles (SiO2) that adhere to the top of the pad. The result obtained for the removal rate 
can be attributed to the fact that the graphite impregnated pad can absorb the slurry; consequently, 
the wettability in the CMP process is remarkably improved. To further investigate the changes in the 
WRR, the friction forces, pad surface profiles, and SEM images after dressing were also studied. 
Plots of the wafer–pad friction force versus time were obtained using a torque dynamometer 
instrument (Fig. 6). The friction force is defined as the change in tension along the direction of 
platen rotation. Figure 6 shows that the average friction force for the graphite impregnated pad 
(approximately 3.95 kg) is significantly larger than that for the porous pad (approximately 2.5 kg). 
The increased friction force leads to a higher WRR since the friction energy shows a high 
correlation with the wafer polishing rate [11–12]. Figure 7 shows representative 2D and 3D images 
of the pad surface that were captured using a stylus-type instrument; Fig. 8, cross-sectional SEM 
images obtained after dressing for 60 min. The figures reveal that the porous pad contains numerous

decrease substantially if the graphite impregnated pad is used. Slurry consumption accounts for the 
largest part of the CMP processing cost, so using the graphite impregnated pad can reduce 
significantly the consumable cost. Figure 9 (b) also shows the variation in the non-uniformity of the 
oxide thin film as a function of the slurry flow rate. No significant difference was observed in the 
non-uniformity when the slurry flow rate was varied. This result indicates that the slurry flow rate 
did not directly affect the wafer non-uniformity. It is also found that the non-uniformity of the 
graphite impregnated pad is better than that of the porous pad for a slurry flow rate of <100 ml/min.
