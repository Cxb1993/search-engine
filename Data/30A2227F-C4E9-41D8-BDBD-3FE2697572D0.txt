Advanced microelectronic components typically consist of heterogeneous, multilayered layered interconnect 
structures made of metal conductor (Cu, solder) and ceramic or polymer based dielectrics. Dominant failure mode of 
these components is by thermal or mechanical fatigue fracture at interfaces of layered interconnect structures, which 
are of micron or sub-micron in length scales. Predicting the reliability of interconnect structure is a challenge due to 
the fact that the materials and associated processes chosen for the dielectrics are new and the response of materials 
interface to cyclic loading is unknown. Approach presently used in the microelectronics industry for characterizing 
interconnect reliability is through either component- or system-level accelerated tests. Issues associated with this 
approach are that the cost is very high and the time needed is too lengthy for the required technology development 
cycle time. Consequently, a phenomenological model that could describe the fatigue ruptures of materials interfaces 
is desired for predicting reliability of interconnects.  
This project focuses on the development of multiscale model to extend fracture mechanics methodology down to 
micron and sub-micron length scales for reliability analysis of microelectronic structures. This includes the 
development of fatigue crack propagation model for modeling delamination and experimental setups for 
characterizing fracture toughness at the interface of interest. To overcome the drastic change in length scale from the 
overall component dimension (in the order of millimeter to centimeter) to the interface rupture “process zone” (in the 
order of micron to sub-micron), a multiscale modeling approach is developed for modeling this problem in the first 
and second years of this project. A continuum theory based global-level model is used to consider a microelectronic 
component with an interfacial flaw under thermal or mechanical loading condition. 3D finite element method with 
virtual crack closure technique is used to determine the asymptotic crack-tip stress and displacement fields. With the 
tractions and displacements near crack tip obtained from the global analysis results, a local model based on cohesive 
laws of rupture at the interface is used to model the progressive propagation of the interfacial crack. Experimental 
setup based on double cantilever beam test is developed in the third year of this project for obtaining the material 
parameters for rupture of the interfaces. The experimental fracture study is conducted to obtain fracture toughness for 
typical interfaces in advanced microelectronic devices, including polyimide (PI)-Au, PI-Si and PI-SiN interfaces. 
The methodology and experimental results described in this report can be used to quantitatively predicting crack 
growth and serving as the framework for modeling reliability of advanced interconnects system.

Samples for the DCB interfacial fracture test are prepared by, first, depositing thin films on a 200mm silicon 
wafer of thickness 730m, and then singulate the wafer into rectangular strips of 70mm10mm. Two Si strips with 
thin film layers on top are then adhered face-to-face using epoxy adhesive. Note that, before the Si strips are bonded, 
a thin gold layer that weakens the bonding between epoxy adhesive and thin film is deposited partially on the surface 
of the thin film stack for serving as the initial weak interface for the DCB specimen. Finally, the silicon sample is 
sandwiched between two Al backing plates using structural adhesive. Figure 2 shows the schematic and picture of an 
interfacial fracture DCB test sample. When the end load is applied on the DCB sample, the crack would kink into 
and propagate along the interface with lowest fracture resistance.

The virtual crack closure technique is based on the hypothesis that crack growth is self-similar and the released 
strain energy during crack growth is the same as the amount of work required to close the crack. Therefore, the strain

For the case when large-scale contact occurs between crack faces around crack tip, the calculation for GI using 
(14) results in zero because the nodal values for crack opening are zero. For the case of a closed crack-tip, the finite 
element discretizations for GII and GIII are still applicable for obtaining II and III, respectively. 
2.3  Corner Delamination in Fan-Out Package 
The corner delamination on the interface of Si die and redistribution PI layer in a fan-out package subjected to 
uniform thermal cooling from 125°C to -40°C is investigated by using the 3-D VCCT. Figure 11 shows the 
schematics of the package. As depicted in Fig. 11(a), the embedded corner interface crack is assumed to be of quarter 
circular shape with a radius of 0.365mm. In the finite element analysis a quarter package model as shown in Fig. 12 
are considered with zero out-of-plane displacement boundary conditions on the symmetric planes. Sizes of the crack 
tip elements shown in Fig. 12(c) are such that  = 0.005mm. Material properties for the package are given in Table 1.

Figure 14. Strain energy release rate for the quarter-circular interface crack under uniform cooling from 125°C 
to -40°C, molding compound: MC1, die thickness: 22mil. 
Effects of molding compound material and die thickness on the corner delamination driving force is shown in 
Fig. 15. It may be seen from Fig. 15 that the maximum strain energy release rate (occurring near the edges of die) for 
the package with MC2 compound is about 1/3 of that for package with MC1 compound. The lower G value for the 
package with MC1 may be attributed to the lower CTE of the MC1 molding compound. Therefore, the interfacial 
fracture reliability for package with MC2 compound is expected to be better than that with MC1 compound. Also it 
can be seen from Fig. 15 that, as die thickness increases, the strain energy release rates around the interior part of the 
crack front reduce. However, the difference in G values is less than 5% for die thicknesses varying between 10mil 
and 22mil. Therefore, the risks of delamination growth are relatively the same for fan-out packages with thick or thin 
dies.

3. Conclusion 
In this research the critical strain energy release rate is obtained by using DCB fracture experiment. The 
experiment is conducted on a custom-developed micro tester. Interfaces considered are PI-SiN interface, PI-Si 
interface and PI-Au interface. These interfaces are some of the common interfaces in state-of-the-art microelectronic 
packages. From the experimental results it is observed that the critical strain energy release rate for the PI-SiN is 
significantly higher than that for the PI-Si interface. The difference may be attributed to the higher roughness of the 
silicon nitride surface when compared to the Si surface. The measured interface toughness may be further combined 
with the fracture mechanics parameters determined for the interfaces in real electronic packages to predict the 
delamination growth in these structures.

ABSTRACT
In this study a process-dependent viscoelastic model is
developed for considering the constitutive relationship of an
epoxy molding compound. The process dependence is realized
by incorporating the phenomenological models for the cure
kinetics, the cure-dependent volume shrinkage, and the cure-
dependent viscoelastic stress relaxation modulus into the
constitutive model for the molding compound. The cure-
dependent viscoelastic model is incorporated into numerical
finite element analysis to simulate warpage of an overmolded
chip scale ball grid array (BGA) package under uniform cooling
from reflow to room temperature. The simulation results are
compared to Shadow Moiré experimental data for validating the
modeling methodology. Additional finite element analyses are
performed to investigate the influence of molding compound
constitutive behavior (temperature-dependent elastic or
viscoelastic) on the package warpage prediction, and to
consider the package warpage evolution during the post-mold
curing (PMC) process.
INTRODUCTION
Warpage is one of the key care-abouts in area-array
electronic packages, in particularly for packaging technologies
such as fine-pitch BGA, ultra-thin package, and package-on-
package designs. Warpage typically occurs as results of molding
compound curing shrinkage and the thermal expansion
mismatch among various packaging materials. Excessive
warpage would lead to misregistration of BGA solder
interconnect during surface mount reflow process. In addition,
the thermomechanical stress associated to warpage may cause
early reliability failures. Therefore, it is important to accurately
assess warpage for manufacturability and reliability during the
package design phase. This, in turn, would require
characterizing the curing, time and temperature-dependent
deformation behavior of the epoxy molding compound and
incorporating it into modeling methodologies.
The effect of curing on the constitutive behavior of
thermosetting polymer and the related application to consider
package warpage have been investigated by many researchers.
For example, Dunne and Sitaraman [1] proposed a coupled
cure-thermal-stress analysis approach to predict warpage and
stress due to the sequential fabrication process for a
multilayered substrate. Yang et al. [2] studied the warpage of
quad flat non-lead (QFN) mold strips by using cure-dependent
viscoelastic model for the molding compound. The influence of
underfill curing shrinkage on flip-chip solder bump fatigue
stresses and strains was also investigated by Yang et al. [3].
In this study, a cure-dependent viscoelastic model is
developed for simulating the thermomechanical behavior of an
epoxy molding compound. The cure kinetics model for the
epoxy compound is first constructed based on differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) experimental characterizations.
Thermal mechanical analysis (TMA) is then performed to
measure the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for the
molding compound. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
under bending vibration mode and uniaxial tensile test are
performed to characterize the constitutive behavior of the
molding compound under various levels of curing. A

where E is the relaxation modulus and is a function of time,
temperature and the DOC. It is assumed that the epoxy resin
considered behaves thermo-rheologically simple (TRS), and,
consequently, the time-temperature superposition principle is
applicable [5] for modeling the relaxation modulus. A master
function for the relaxation modulus may be described by using
the generalized Maxwell model (also known as the Prony
series), which is given by [5]

In addition to the temperature dependence, the relaxation
modulus is also affected by the DOC. During molding
compound curing process, the thermosetting polymer
transforms from a liquid state into a viscoelastic solid state with
a higher relaxation time. By using a similar approach to the
time-temperature superposition, a curing shift factor ac is used
to account for the relaxation time dependency on the DOC [6]:

where refgT is the glass transition temperature at the reference

To characterize the viscoelastic response of the epoxy
molding compound, rectangular samples of 60mm × 10mm ×
2mm with four different DOCs (72%, 81%, 88%, and 99%) are
prepared. The samples are analyzed by using dynamic
mechanical analyzer (TA Instruments DMA 2980) with a three-
point bending test configuration. The fully cured samples are
analyzed under eight different vibrating frequencies (1, 5, 10,
20, 50, 100, 150, 200Hz) and between -30°C and 300°C with a
heating rate of 10°C/min. The partially cured samples are also
evaluated under the same conditions, but only up to 150°C to
prevent curing reaction.
Figures 3 and 4 show the storage moduli measured from the
fully cured samples. By using a reference temperature of

Comparison between the fitted time-cure function and
experimental results is shown in Fig. 9.
Note that using DMA for characterizing the molding
compound viscoelastic response is advantageous from the
perspectives of easy sample preparation and fast data collection.
However, the three-point bending test configuration used in the
DMA test is sensitive to sample flatness. To overcome this
issue, uniaxial tensile tests using Instron 5565 tester are also
conducted to measure elastic modulus at various temperatures.
By fitting the generalized Maxwell model to the test results, it is
obtained that the glassy modulus 0 32 GPa.E 
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion and Curing
Shrinkage
Thermal expansion behavior of the molding compound is
analyzed by using TA Instruments TMA 2940 instrument.
Samples with various DOCs (72%, 81%, 88% and 99%) are
scanned from -70°C to 270°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min.
Figure 10 shows the TMA measurement results. It may be seen
from Fig. 10 that the CTE differences among samples with
various DOCs are not significant. Therefore, it is assumed that
the CTE of molding compound is independent of the DOC. The
experimental results are then fitted to a piecewise linear
function. Comparison of the CTE model and TMA experimental
data is shown in Fig. 11.

Warpage Simulation for During Post-Mold Curing
Process
In the process warpage simulation, the temperature profile
for the post-molding process considered consists of (i) cooling
from molding temperature (175°C) to 30°C in 30min, (ii)
heating from 30°C to PMC temperature (175°C) in 5min, (iii)
curing at 175°C for 1hr, 2hr or 4hr, (iv) cooling down to 30°C
in 30min. In order to predict the process-induced warpage, cure
dependent viscoelastic properties of molding compound is used
in the finite element model. It is assumed that the package
components are stress free at 175°C right before injection
molding, and that the initial stress and warpage after mold
release at 175°C are due to molding compound reaction
shrinkage during injection molding. By using the cure-kinetics
model (1) and the volume-DOC model (10), volumetric
shrinkage of the molding compound during molding is
calculated to be 0.2652%. Details of the finite element
implementation for the package warpage simulation for post-
molding and during PMC process can be found in [9].
Results of the warpage simulation are shown in Figs. 15-
17. It can be seen from Fig. 15 that the initial warpage at 175°C
due to injection molding process is 63m. The warpage value
first increases and then decreases as the temperature cools down
to 30°C. Similar temperature dependence is also observed for
package warpage during the stage of heating to PMC
temperature. During the PMC process at 175°C, the warpage
value first increases quickly as the molding compound cures.
However, the curing reaction and chemical shrinkage stops
within less than 10min. After 10min the amount of warpage
changes very little. This may be attributed to the quick
relaxation of the molding compound at 175°C, which is much
higher than the glass transition temperature of the molding
compound. During the final stage of cooling down from PMC
temperature, the warpage, again, increases initially and then
decreases as temperature drops. Comparing the simulation
results (Figs. 15-17) for various PMC schedule (1hr, 2hr or
4hr), it is observed that the final warpage values are almost the
same. This is simply due to that the curing reaction completes
very shortly after the PMC process starts, and the additional
isothermal dwell at 175°C makes little difference.
SHADOW MOIRE EXPERIMENT
To validate the simulation predictions, warpage
measurements are performed by using AkroMetrix TherMoiré
PS88 shadow Moiré instrument. Figure 18 shows the pictures of
the package sample used for the shadow Moiré analysis. The
package warpage is measured on the bottom (BGA side) of the
package. In order to have a flat surface for shadow Moiré
measurement, the BGA solder balls are not attached for these
samples.
