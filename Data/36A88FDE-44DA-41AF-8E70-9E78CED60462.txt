points on the cylinder surface were altered by the galloping rod, implying that the whole 
flow field surrounding the square cylinder was modified by the vibrating rod installed 
around the leading edge of the upwind-facing lateral face. The Strouhal numbers of the 
controlled and uncontrolled cylinders did not present significant difference. The 
variations of the pressure coefficients induced by the galloping rod were closely related 
with the modification of the flow field on the cylinder surface. The decrease of pressure 
coefficient on the upwind-facing faces and the increase on the leeward-facing faces 
reduced the drag of the controlled cylinder by about 25% when compared with the 
uncontrolled cylinder. 
 
1. Introduction 
As a flow passes a square cylinder, complex flow phenomena and behaviors in the 
vicinity of the surface and the wake region (e.g., flow separation, vortex shedding, and 
shear-layer instability, etc.) are usually induced. Since the square cylinder has four sharp 
edges, the separation points are fixed at the leading edges. The aerodynamic behaviors 
are therefore relatively insensitive to Reynolds number, but are more sensitive to the 
angle of incidence (Okajima 1982). Consequently the flow characteristics, aerodynamic 
forces, vortex shedding frequency, heat-transfer performance, etc., would exhibit distinct 
behaviors at different incidence angles of the square cylinder (Igarashi 1984). Literature 
discussing the pressure distributions, lift, drag, and vortex shedding characteristics of a 
square cylinder in crossflow were published during the past decades, e.g., Vickery (1966), 
Bearman & Trueman (1972), Lee (1975), Obasaju (1983), Norberg (1993), Tamura & 
Miyagi (1999), Saha et al. (2000), Dutta et al. (2003), Sarioglu et al. (2005), Lao et al.

in the subcritical regime was therefore also denoted as the dual-ring bubble mode. In the 
supercritical regime (15o < α < 45o), the separated boundary layer on the lateral surface 
facing windward reattached to the surface and hence formed a recirculation bubble. On 
the lateral surface facing leeward, the separated boundary layer never reattached to the 
surface; instead, a shallow and wide recirculation bubble covering the rear part of the 
surface was formed. The characteristic flow pattern in the supercritical regime was 
therefore also denoted as the single bubble mode. At the incidence angle 45o, a symmetric 
wedge flow was observed on the two surfaces facing windward. The Strouhal number of 
vortex shedding, turbulence in the wake, and wake width presented different 
characteristics in different characteristic flow regimes, and exhibited close correlations 
with the flow patterns. 
In order to reduce the drag and to suppress the periodic forces induced by the 
surface-flow separation and vortex shedding of the square cylinder, a static rod 
flow-control method has been proposed by Igarashi (1997), Sarioglu et al. (2005), and 
Zhang et al. (2005). A rigid rod was installed at a distance upstream the square cylinder. 
Two flow patterns (cavity and vortex shedding) between the rod wake and the square 
cylinder were found. Reduction in the drag coefficient of the square cylinder in the range 
of small incidence angles was observed as the arrangement of the control rod and square 
cylinder induced cavity flow pattern between the rod wake and the square cylinder. 
However, at mid and large incidence angles the drag of the square cylinder was 
unexpectedly increased by installing the control rod. 
The present work was aimed on examining the effectiveness of a flow control 
method, which was termed the self-excited vibrating rod method (Huang et al. 2006), on 
 5 
L/w = 9.3. The surface of the cylinder was carefully and slightly polished by using wetted 
magnesium-oxide particles of 0.2 µm. Circular disks (which acted as end-plates) were 
attached to the lower and upper ends of the square cylinder. Stansby (1974), Fox & West 
(1990), Gerich & Eckelmann (1982), and Szepessy & Bearman (1992) discussed the 
effects of aspect ratio on the pressure force and vortex shedding of a circular cylinder in 
cross stream. They proposed the use of cylinders with an aspect ratio greater than 30 or 
employment of end plates to the cylinder with a separation greater than 7 to reduce 
three-dimensional effects of the flow field. Before the experiments were formally 
conducted, we performed surface-oil flow tests to check the difference between the cases 
with and without end-plates. Figure 2 shows pictures of surface-oil flow patterns in the 
lower portions of the square cylinder at Reynolds number 7.7 × 104. For the case without 
end-plates (Fig. 2(a)), the oil streaks presented serious three-dimensional characteristics 
around the end region. For the case with end-plates (Fig. 2(b)), the oil streaks presented 
visually two-dimensional characteristics at least within the range -3 < z/w < 3. We also 
placed a one-dimensional hot-wire anemometer in the wake of the square cylinder at 
various angles of attack and surveyed along the z direction. The detected vortex-shedding 
frequencies in the wake of cylinder installed with end plates showed uniform 
distributions at least in the range -3.1 < z/w < 3.1. Observations on the flow patterns and 
measurements of the surface pressure and vortex shedding properties were focused across 
the central section of cylinder within z/w = ± 0.5, which was subject to negligibly small 
three-dimensional effects. The Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) was fixed to the 
mid-span and the center of the square cylinder, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The coordinates did 
not rotate with rotation of the square cylinder. The freestream direction was always 
 7 
switch consisted of a 0.75 mm diameter optical fiber transmitter/receiver and a high 
response photoelectric amplifier was used to detect the vibration frequencies and 
amplitudes. An optical fiber transmitter/receiver produced a beam of modulated infrared 
light and received the target-reflected optical signals. The photoelectric amplifier had a 
frequency response up to 20 kHz, which could output a negative square-wave voltage 
signal when a light-reflective object passed through the sensible region of the optical 
transmitter/receiver. The voltage outputs were fed into a fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
analyzer to extract the frequency of rod vibration. The rod vibration frequency increased 
a little from 65 Hz to 73 Hz as the Reynolds number increased from 4.5 × 104 to 1.1 × 105. 
The amplitudes of the rod orbiting motion were 10φ ~ 15φ (long axis) and 8.5φ ~ 10.6φ 
(short axis) as the Reynolds number increased from 4.5 × 104 to 1.1 × 105. 
The closed-return wind tunnel used for the experiments had a test-section of 60 cm × 
60 cm × 120 cm, made of one polished aluminum alloy plate as the floor and three 
high-transparency acrylic panels as the ceiling and side walls. The operating freestream 
velocity U in the test-section was adjustable between 0.3 and 60 m/s by using an 
electronic inverter. The maximum turbulence intensity was less than 0.2% for U > 3 m/s. 
The average freestream velocity U was detected with a retractable Pitot tube along with a 
high precision electronic pressure transducer. The outer diameter of the Pitot tube was 3 
mm. In order not to disturb flow field, the Pitot tube was retracted to the floor of the 
test-section when the experiments were carried out. The accuracy of the measurement of 
freestream velocity was affected primarily by the alignment of Pitot tube and the 
calibration of pressure transducer. With the help of an on-line micro-pressure calibration 
system and the careful alignment of Pitot tube, the uncertainty of the freestream velocity 
 9 
replaced by a platinum wire. The wire diameter and length were 5 µm and 1.5 mm, 
respectively. The dynamic response frequency corresponding to the electronic 
square-wave test was adjusted to 20 kHz. The sampling rate and the elapse time of the 
data acquisition system were set to 25,000 samples/s and 5 s, respectively. The 
uncertainty of the frequency detection was estimated to be within ±0.75 percent of the 
reading. 
Measurements of time-averaged surface pressure distributions were done through a 
special design of square cylinder. The hollow square cylinder was composed of three 
sections and two caps, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The central section had a height of 6 cm. 
Thirty two pressure taps in total were carefully made and evenly distributed around the 
peripheral of the central section of the square cylinder in two rows. The diameter of the 
tap hole and spacing between two neighboring taps were 1 mm and 6.67 mm, 
respectively. For each tap, a short stainless steel tube was tightly inserted into the tap hole 
from the inside of the hollow cylinder and subsequently connected to a plastic polyester 
tube. The polyester tube was led through a hole located at the upper cap of the cylinder 
and connected to a home-made pressure scanner. The pressure signals transmitted 
through the taps, small-diameter stainless steel tubing, polyester tubing, and finally 
attained the home-made computer-based pressure scanner. The pressure scanner used a 
personal computer and a logic circuit to control the states (on/off) of 32 electromagnetic 
valves. The electromagnetic valves may be opened and closed sequentially at a preset 
through-time, shut-off time, and scanning rate. The pressure sensor was piezoelectric type 
with a full scale of ±127 mmAq. It was constantly calibrated with a micro-pressure 
calibrator to an uncertainty of 0.01 mmAq. The output analog signals of the pressure

boundary-layer separation because the vibration motion of rod agitates the flow near the 
leading edge of face B and smears off the dual-ring bubble which originally exists there 
under uncontrolled condition. The effect of breaking down the dual-ring bubble lasts until 
α < 11o, then the flow pattern changes. In the range 11o < α < 45o, the surface-oil flow on 
face B presents a pattern similar to that at α = 20o of Fig. 4(a)—a single dark oil-strip 
appears. The flows on two sides of the single dark oil strip go away from the strip. 
Because the surface flow upstream the strip goes upstream and the surface flow 
downstream the strip goes downstream, the dark strip is thus a three-way saddle with the 
flow above the strip going towards the strip. The dark oil strip is induced by the 
reattachment of the separated boundary layer. In the hand sketch beneath the picture, the 
black dot marked on face B denotes the dark oil strip (or the reattachment point) in the 
picture. A recirculation bubble must exist between the three-way saddle and the leading 
edge of face B. At α = 45o, no accumulated dark oil strip is observed and the surface-oil 
flow goes downstream without any reversal. This flow pattern is induced because at α = 
45o the free stream impinges at the junction between face A and face B and bifurcates to 
the downstream region along faces A and B.  
The surface-oil flow patterns on face C, as shown in Fig. 4(b), present a little 
complex scenario than those on face B. All the surface-oil flow patterns at α < 11o 
present features similar to that shown for α = 7o of Fig. 4(b)—two oil strips appear on 
face C. The surface-oil flows on two sides of the upstream oil strip direct away from the 
strip. While those for the downstream oil strip direct towards the strip. This surface-oil 
flow pattern on face C at α < 11o is similar to the “dual-ring bubble” mode pattern 
observed at α < 15o on the corresponding face of an uncontrolled square cylinder 
 13 
C; the flow structure on face C therefore would not behave similarly to that at α = 20o of 
Fig. 4(a). Since the surface flows on both faces C and D near the junction between faces 
C and D go towards the junction (Fig. 4(c)), a separatrix evolving from the junction 
between faces C and D would go outwards from the junction. This separatrix leaving the 
junction between faces C and D would be deflected upstream by the reverse flow in the 
cylinder wake, reattach to face C, and form a recirculation bubble which covers the rear 
part of face C, as shown in the hand sketch beneath the picture at α = 36o of Fig. 4(b). 
With this structure, the separatrices and alleyways can satisfy the flow directions and 
three-way saddle identified in the surface-oil flow pattern. This scenario is similar to that 
observed on face C of the uncontrolled square cylinder in the supercritical regime for 15o 
< α < 45o. Placing the vibrating rod near the leading edge of face B could cause the flow 
patterns on both the faces B and C to change synchronously from subcritical to 
supercritical mode at an advanced incidence angle 11o. At α = 45o, no accumulated dark 
oil strip is observed and the surface-oil flow goes downstream without any reversal, as 
that has been show for face B.  
 The typical surface-oil flow patterns on face D (i.e., the rear face) are shown in Fig. 
4(c). When the incidence angle is smaller than 45o the single dark oil strip pattern, as 
typically shown in the pictures for α = 7o and 13o, is always observed. The single oil strip 
in the range α < 11o is always located in the right portion (+x’) of face D. While the 
single oil strip in the range 11o < α < 45o is always located in the left portion (-x’) of face 
D. The oil flows on two sides of the dark oil strip go away from the strip. Apparently, the 
single dark oil strip appearing on face D is a three-way saddle. The flow above the strip 
goes towards it. In order to comply with the flow directions and the three-way saddles 
 15 
of Fig. 4(b). An aft stagnation point S6’ on face D and a four-way saddle S2 in the near 
wake region construct a large near-wake bubble. The large bubble located downstream 
face D is composed of two large counter-rotating vortices which are centered at the nodes 
N3 and N4. This recirculation bubble looks similar to those usually found in a bluff-body 
wake. For the uncontrolled square cylinder in crossflow (Huang et al. 2010), the dual-ring 
bubbles appear on both faces B and C in the subcritical regime α < 15o. Modulated by the 
galloping rod, the range of incidence angle for the subcritical mode reduces from 15o to 
11o, the dual-ring bubble near the leading edge of face B disappears, and the boundary 
layer separates from there without reattachment. Hunt et al. (1978) obtained a general 
formula for the relationship between the number of nodes (including four-way nodes N 
and three-way nodes N’) and saddles (including four-way saddles S and three-way 
saddles S’) for the flow around the surface obstacles. The topological rule proposed by 
Hunt et al. (1978) is (∑N +
2
1
∑N’) - (∑S +
2
1
∑S’) = 1 - n, in which n is the connectivity 
of the section of the flow under consideration. In this case, n = 2 because one solid 
obstacle is present in the flow field. By counting the number of critical points in Fig. 5(a), 
N = 4. N’ = 0, S = 2, S’ = 6, it is obvious that the proposed flow pattern satisfies the 
topological rule (∑N +
2
1
∑N’) - (∑S +
2
1
∑S’) = -1. 
The supercritical and wedge flow patterns are shown in Figs. 5(b) and 5(c), 
respectively. Figure 5(b) shows the single bubble existing near the leading edge of face B 
and the trailing edge of face C, as demonstrated in previous paragraphs. Figure 5(c) 
presents the time-averaged regular flow pattern similar to a flow passes across a wedge. 
These topological flow features were the same as those delineated by Huang et al. (2010) 
 17 
on face B should be an important factor participating in the modification of the stagnation 
location on face A. Applying agitation in the separated boundary layer of face B causes 
change of flow characteristics. The signal of downstream-flow change on face B 
feedbacks to the upstream face A and causes the stagnation point on face A to shift from 
its natural state. The flow around the square cylinder presents strong elliptic 
characteristics because of the reverse flow which is induced by the sharp corner angles.  
The normalized location wx /
∗
′
 of the single oil strip of the supercritical mode on 
face B is shown in Fig. 6(b). The stagnation point induced by reattachment of the 
separated boundary layer is located in the downstream portion ( wx /
∗
′
 > 0) of face B at 
the incidence angles smaller than about 21o, which indicates a large recirculation bubble 
existing on face B at 11o < α < 21o. At α ≈ 11o, the recirculation bubble on face B of the 
controlled cylinder can even cover almost 90% of face B. The normalized bubble length 
(equaling to the value of wx /
∗
′ +0.5) of the uncontrolled cylinder is significantly smaller 
than that of the controlled cylinder. After the rod ceases to vibrate (α > 26o), the bubble 
length on face B of the controlled cylinder shortens abruptly and behaves similarly to that 
of the uncontrolled cylinder. 
The normalized locations wx /
∗
′
 of the downstream three-way saddle on face C, as 
shown in Fig. 6(c), behave differently from those shown in Fig. 6(b) for face B. For the 
control cylinder in the subcritical regime, the downstream strip on face C at α = 0o is 
located at wx /
∗
′ ≈ 0.05, which is a little downstream of the middle of face C. It moves 
upstream as the incidence angle is increased and reaches wx /
∗
′ ≈ -0.14 at the critical 
incidence angle α = 11o. As the flow pattern changes to the supercritical mode in the 
 19 
B causes different surface-flow patterns appearing on face B and C, and subsequently 
induces unbalanced time-averaged wake in downstream region. The location of the 
stagnation point on face D of the controlled cylinder therefore is shifted from the center 
position of face D. In the subcritical regime the normalized location of the dark oil strip 
moves towards the junction between faces C and D and attains wy /
∗
′
 ≈ 0.21 as α 
approaches the critical incidence angle of 11o. As the incidence angle just passes the 
critical incidence angle, the dark oil strip shifts drastically from wy /
∗
′
 ≈ 0.21 to 
wy /
∗
′ ≈ - 0.31. Continuing to increase the incidence angle in the supercritical range 
makes the dark oil strip move towards the center of face D. 
 
3.3. Vortex shedding and wake width 
Figure 7(a) shows typical velocity signals detected in the near wake by applying a 
single-wire probe of the hot-wire annemometer at Rew = 7.7×104. The measurement 
position is at (x/w, y/w, z/w) = (3, 0.5, 0). It shows typical vortex shedding signals 
superimposed by turbulent fluctuations in time domain. Converting the time series to 
frequency domain by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique, the power 
spectrum density function is obtained, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The vortex shedding 
frequency fs corresponding to the time series of Fig. 7(a) is 51.3 Hz, as indicated by the 
peak value of Fig. 7(b). Figure 7(c) shows the frequency distributions of the vortex 
shedding, which are obtained from the power spectrum density functions for 0o ≤ α ≤ 45o 
at various freestream Reynolds numbers. It is apparent that for each specific freestream 
Reynolds number, the vortex shedding frequency increases with increasing the incidence 
angle from a low value at α = 0o to a hump which located around α = 11o ~ 15o, then 
 21 
Rew = 7.7 × 104, presents a twin-peak pattern. The peak values of the turbulence-intensity 
distributions would appear in the shear layers (Brown & Roshko 1974). The distance 
between these two peaks could be used for indexing the length scale of the wake width. 
Figure 9(b) shows the maximum turbulence intensities in the shear layers at Rew = 7.7 × 
104. The turbulence intensities in the shear layer of the controlled cylinder are apparently 
higher than those of the uncontrolled cylinder, which may be induced by the agitation 
effect of the vibrating rod. For the controlled cylinder, in the subcritical regime (α < 11o) 
the maximum turbulence intensity TSL increases with increasing the incidence angle. It 
presents a local minimum at α = 15o. The uncontrolled cylinder behaves similarly with 
the controlled one: a local minimum appears at α = 15o. The rod vibration, although 
changes the surface flow modes and advances the critical incidence angle between the 
subcritical and supercritical modes from 15o to 11o, it does not affect the incidence angle 
which the local minimum value of the maximum turbulence intensity appears. The wake 
widths identified by the transverse distance between the peak turbulence intensities 
appearing in the shear layers are illustrated in Fig. 9(c). The wake width of the controlled 
cylinder does not vary appreciably for α < 15o. After α > 15o, it increases with the 
increase of incidence angle. The Strouhal number shown in Fig. 8 therefore presents 
maximum values at α = 15o. 
 
3.4. Surface pressure and lift/drag coefficient 
Figure 10 shows the measured distributions of the surface pressure coefficient Cp on 
faces A - D of the controlled cylinder. The pressure coefficient is defined as Cp ≡ (p - 
p
o
)/(0.5×ρU2), where p denotes the measured local surface static pressure and p
o
, ρ, and 
 23 
recirculation bubble which is induced by the reattachment of the separated boundary 
layer reduces with the increase of incidence angle as discussed previously. The location 
corresponding to the extreme values of the surface pressure coefficient on face B moves 
towards the junction between faces A and B (s/w =1) with increasing the incidence angle. 
The whole profile of the surface pressure coefficient is raised in values with the increase 
of incidence angle. This is attributed to the increase of the angle between the freestream 
direction and face B which is increased with increasing the incidence angle, and therefore 
gains in the dynamic-pressure component normal to face B. As α > 30o, e.g. at α = 35o as 
shown in Fig. 10(c), the surface pressure coefficients around the upstream portion of face 
B can attain a positive value about 0.3. At α = 45o (i.e., the wedge flow), as shown in Fig. 
10(d), the maximum pressure coefficient is raised to about one, which is located at the 
junction between faces A and B, and the distribution curves of pressure coefficient on 
faces A and B become almost symmetric about the vertex at s/w =1. 
On faces C, the surface pressure coefficients always present low negative values in 
three characteristic flow regimes because the boundary layer separated from the leading 
edge of face C never reattaches to the surface. In the subcritical regime, as typically 
shown in Fig. 10(a) for α = 0o, traces of local minimum values, though unclear, can be 
observed for s/w between 3 and 4. The locations of the unclear minimum surface pressure 
coefficients correspond to the positions of the downstream three-way saddle (with the 
flow above the saddle going outwards from it) shown in Fig. 5(a). When the flow pattern 
changes to the supercritical and wedge modes, as shown in Figs. 10(b) - 10(d) for α = 25o, 
35o, and 45o, the surface pressure coefficients on face C slightly decrease from about -1.3 
around the upstream edge (s/w ~ 4) to about -1.5 around the downstream edge (s/w ~ 3). 
 25 
the values of Apc ,  do not vary significantly. As the incidence angle becomes greater than 
the critical value (11o for the controlled case and 15o for the uncontrolled case), Apc ,  
decreases quickly with the increase of α in the supercritical regime because the 
component of the freestream momentum normal to the surface decreases with the 
increase of incidence angle. 
On face B, as shown in Fig. 11(b), the surface-averaged pressure coefficient Bpc ,  
remains low and negative values in the subcritical regime because the boundary-layer 
separates at the upstream edge of face B. As α exceeds the critical value, Bpc ,  increases 
rapidly with the increase of incidence angle in the supercritical regime because the 
separated boundary layer reattaches to the face B and forms a single bubble on the 
upstream portion of face B. The component of freestream momentum normal to the 
surface plays a role in increasing the surface pressure and would increase with the 
increase of incidence angle in this regime. The length of the recirculation bubble shortens 
as the incidence angle increases (as has been shown in Fig. 6(b)) and the component of 
freestream momentum normal to the surface also increases; therefore the 
surface-averaged pressure coefficient increases rapidly in the supercritical regime. The 
negative effect induced by the recirculation bubble and the positive effect induced by the 
freestream momentum component normal to the surface attains balance at α = 35o and 
hence makes Bpc ,  approach about zero. At α > 35
o
, Bpc ,  presents positive values. 
On face C, the surface-averaged pressure coefficient presents negative values for all 
incidence angles because the boundary layer separated from the leading edge of face C 
never reattaches to the surface and the surface always face lee-wards for α = 0o ~ 45o. In 
 27 
increasing α to minimum values at the critical incidence angles, then increase with 
increasing the incidence angle until about α = 35o. At α > 35o, CD decreases a little with 
increasing the incidence angle. The minimum values appear at the critical incidence 
angles because the width of the near wake reduces to a minimum at the critical incidence 
angle. The drag coefficients of the controlled cylinder generally present values smaller by 
about 0.5 than those of the uncontrolled cylinder (except in the regime around the critical 
incidence angles). A maximum reduction of about 25% is not specific. This significant 
reduction in the drag coefficient is because the averaged surface pressure coefficients 
Cpc ,  and Dpc ,  on faces C and D (as shown in Figs. 11(c) and (d)), respectively, of the 
controlled cylinder are drastically raised by the vibrating rod placed around the leading 
edge of face B when compared with those of the uncontrolled cylinder. Since faces C and 
D are always facing leeward, increase of the surface pressures Cpc ,  and Dpc ,  on faces C 
and D therefore cause the drag coefficient to reduce. Another reason is because the 
averaged surface pressure coefficients Apc ,  and Bpc ,  on faces A and B (as shown in 
Figs. 11(a) and (b)), respectively, of the controlled cylinder are a little smaller than those 
of the uncontrolled cylinder. Since face A and B are always facing upwind, decreases of 
pressure coefficients on faces A and B therefore partially contribute to reducing the drag. 
The lift coefficient CL of the controlled cylinder presents nonzero value at α = 0o, as 
shown in Fig. 12(b) because the flow patterns on faces B and C are asymmetric (leading 
edge separation on face B and dual-ring bubble on face C, as shown on Fig. 5(a)). The 
averaged pressure coefficients Apc ,  and Bpc ,  at α = 0
o
 are about -1.75 (Fig. 11(b)) and 
-1.22 (Fig. 11(c)), respectively. A net lift coefficient at α = 0o about -0.5 is therefore 
 29 
results of the surface-oil flow patterns. The flows around the square cylinder were 
identified as three categories: the subcritical, supercritical, and wedge flows according to 
the prominently different features of the topological flow patterns. Owing to the influence 
of the galloping rod, the flow pattern on the face which was agitated by the rod changed 
from its natural state of the dual ring bubble to the mode of boundary-layer separation. 
The critical incidence angle separating the subcritical and supercritical modes was 
advance to 11o from its natural state of 15o. The qualitative surface-oil flow patterns on 
the front face, un-agitated lateral face, and rear face of the controlled cylinder presented 
no significant differences from those of the uncontrolled cylinder. However, the locations 
of the stagnation points on the front face as well as the three-way saddles on the lateral 
faces and rear face were all altered by the galloping rod. This implied that the whole flow 
field surrounding the square cylinder was modified by the vibrating rod installed around 
the leading edge of the lateral face. The Strouhal number of the controlled cylinder and 
did not differentiate significantly from that of the uncontrolled cylinder. The 
face-averaged pressure coefficient at faces A and B of the controlled cylinder were a little 
lower than their counterparts of the uncontrolled cylinder. On faces C and D of the 
controlled cylinder, they were significantly larger than those of the uncontrolled cylinder. 
The variations of the pressure coefficients induced by the influence of the galloping rod 
were closely related with the modification of the flow field on the cylinder surface. The 
decrease of pressure coefficient on faces A and B and the increase on faces C and D 
cause the drag of the controlled cylinder to reduce significantly when compared with that 
of the uncontrolled cylinder.

Abstract 
 
Because the performance of conventional class II biological safety cabinets (BSC) is easily affected by the 
influences of dynamic motions such as when a person walks by, sash movements, and operator hands 
movements, this study applies an “air curtain” technique to BSC and tests its effectiveness in reducing the 
influences of dynamic motions. The containment performance was measured by using the tracer-gas leakage 
concentration method. When the cabinet was operated under the influences of dynamic situations, as are 
encountered mostly in the practical uses of BSC, the leakage levels of the cabinet without air curtain are 
significantly raised, while BSC with air curtain shows almost no leakage. 
 
 
Key words: air-curtain BSC, occupational health, industrial ventilation. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Biological safety cabinets (BSC) are used to provide 
personnel protection, product protection, and cross-
contamination protection. There are three categories 
of safety cabinets which are designated classes I, II, 
and III. The class II cabinet has a downward flow of 
sterile air in the working area bathing the material 
being handled. The flow is drawn through two grills 
(or slots) which are respectively arranged near the 
doorsill and the lower back wall of the cabinet. The 
streams drawn through the grills pass through ducts 
to a system of fans and filters where most of the 
flow is recirculated through the working area and 
the rest is exhausted to the atmosphere through a 
filter. It is designated type B1 if 70% of the total 
flow is recirculated and type B2 when no flow is 
recirculated (NSF Joint Committee on Biosafety 
Cabinetry 2002). The class II type B2 biological 
safety cabinet is the subject of the present study. 
 
Many research results have been published to 
discuss the static performance, test method, and 
containment improvement of the class II biological 
safety cabinet, e.g., Clark et al. (1990) and Osborne 
et al. (1999). However, studies on the dynamic 
effects induced by the crossdraft, people walking by, 
sash movements, and operator hands movements are 
relatively rare. Rake (1978) investigated the 
influence of the crossdrafts on the containment 
efficiency of the biological safety cabinet and found 
that BSC is very sensitive to the crossdrafts. When 
the draft velocity is greater than about 0.4 m/s, the 
leakage increases logarithmically with the increase 
of draft velocity.  
 
The purpose of this work is to develop a BSC with 
the application of an “air curtain” technique and to 
examine the aerodynamic characteristics and 
containment performance of the air-curtain BSC 
under the influence of dynamic motions by using 
the flow visualization technique, laser Doppler 
velocimetry, and tracer-gas detection method. The 
configuration of the air-curtain BSC proposed in 
this study is a modification of Huang et al (2007). It 
consisted of three parts - a sash (with a channel for 
the supply of push jet at blow velocity Vb), a suction 
slot (behind the doorsill for the exhaust of 
contaminants at suction velocity Vs), and a cabinet 
(with a HEPA filter installed atop so that the sterile 
air goes downwards at velocity Vc). The back 
suction slot commonly used in the conventional 
cabinet was discarded in this design in order not to 
create a counter force against the air curtain. The 
slot width was drastically smaller than those of the 
front and back grills in the conventional safety 
cabinets. The physical variables, Vs, Vb, and Vc can 
be independently adjusted. Inverters were used to 
control the flow speeds.

curtain and the no air curtain condition. At H = 25 
cm, the leakages of the no air curtain condition and 
the severely concave curtain have relatively low 
values. Because the biological safety cabinets are 
mostly operated at low sash openings, the existing 
widely-used cabinets operated without air curtain  
configuration rarely display severe hazards under 
the static test conditions. However, the leakage 
levels of the slightly concave curtain present the 
lowest values among all characteristic modes at 
both high and low sash heights. At H = 25 cm, the 
leakages are barely detected. Comparing the leakage 
levels of the no air curtain condition ((Vb, Vs, Vc) = 
(0, 8, 0.25) m/s) with the slightly concave curtain  
mode ((Vb, Vs, Vc) = (0.5, 8, 0.25) m/s) listed in 
Table 2, it is apparent that providing a small jet 
velocity at the front aperture to set up the air curtain 
of the slightly concave curtain mode can improve 
the personnel protection performance of the cabinet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tables 3 and 4 show the leakage levels detected 
under the walk-by test condition at  H = 50 cm and 
25 cm, respectively. The sweep velocity of the plate 
is Vp = 1.0 m/s. At the no air curtain condition (Vb = 
0), the leakages at Vs = 8 m/s and 10 m/s are all 
unexpectedly large, even when the sash height is 50 
cm or 25 cm. It is apparent that the personnel 
protection would be drastically minimized as the 
walk-bys are applied in front of the aperture in the 
no air curtain condition. Operating the cabinet at a 
straight curtain mode will induce the largest 
leakage, even when the sash height is 50 cm of 25 
cm. The reason for this is that the in-cabinet 
pressure is close to the environmental pressure 
which makes the jet go straight onto the doorsill. 
Sweeping the plate across the front aperture would 
induce low pressure in the wake region. The 
pressure difference between the wake and the 
cabinet becomes negative which makes the leakage 
level high. At the high sash H = 50 cm (Table 3), 
the leakage can be decreased to a negligibly low 
level at a suction velocity of Vs = 10 m/s. At the low 
sash height H = 25 cm (Table 4), which is about the 
aperture height recommended for use in most 
biological safety cabinets, the leakage levels are 
almost negligible when the cabinet is operated 
either at a severely concave curtain mode or slightly 
concave curtain mode. Since the severely concave 
curtain mode may minimize product protection and 
cross-contamination protection, operating the 
cabinet at a low suction velocity at the slightly 
concave curtain mode will be a reasonable way to 
optimize the considerations of leakage and energy 
consumption. In this case, operation condition  (Vb, 
Vs, Vc) = (0.5, 8, 0.25) m/s for low sash H = 25 cm 
and (Vb, Vs, Vc) = (1, 10, 0.32) m/s for high sash H = 
50 cm are recommended. The plate velocity Vp 
varying from 0.5 m/s to 1.5 m/s was tested in the 
study. It was found that the above recommended 
operation conditions can still perform well. 
However, the leakage concentration of SF6 at no air 
curtain condition increases significantly with the 
increase of the sweep velocity of plate. For instance, 
at Vp = 1.5 m/s, Cave attains 0.548 ppm and 0.381 
ppm at (Vb, Vs, Vc) = (0, 8, 0.25) m/s for H = 50 cm 
and 25 cm, respectively. This result corresponds to 
the observation of Rake (1978) for the influence of 
crossdrafts on the leakage level of the conventional 
biological safety cabinet, that the leakage of 
containment increases drastically with the increase 
of draft velocity as the draft velocity is greater than 
about 0.4 m/s. 
 
Tables 5 and 6 show the leakage levels detected 
under the sash-movement test condition at  H = 50 
cm and 25 cm, respectively. The straight curtain 
mode presents the largest leakage concentration 
among all cases and the slightly concave curtain 
mode has an almost negligible leakage
