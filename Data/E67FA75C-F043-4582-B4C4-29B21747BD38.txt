Abstract 
Applying an electric field across a fluid layer with a conductivity gradient can induce an 
electrical body force destabilizing the flow and simultaneously generate Joule-heating effect. For 
microfluidic devices with high surface area to volume ratio, the Joule heating can be removed and 
the onset of instability occurs only when the electrical body force overcomes the viscous force. For 
mini-scale devices containing conducting solutions, the Joule heating can induce thermal buoyancy 
sufficiently to affect the stability. This paper performs an analysis to examine the possible impact 
on the stability due to the presence of Joule-heating-induced buoyancy. Results show that for the 
cases of low conductivity gradient, the induced buoyancy always appears to enhance the 
electrohydrodynamic instability regardless of the direction of buoyancy. However, at high 
conductivity gradients, the buoyancy may become a stabilizing mechanism if the electrical field and 
the buoyancy are on the opposite direction. 
Keywords: Electrohydrodynamics, microfluidic device, Joule heating, linear stability analysis. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) is a subject that investigates the phenomena of fluid flows in the 
presence of electrostatic force [1]. Subjected to electric force, the fluid flow can become unstable 
once the applied electric field exceeds the threshold value [2-4]. The instability phenomena

local free charges accumulation and generating a steady electrical current density 0J  that produces 
Joule heating. Both upper and lower boundaries are fixed at temperature 0T  and thus it forms a 
temperature profile. The fluid is considered to be a dilute binary symmetric electrolyte solution that 
obeys the Ohmic law. Assume that the difference between cationic and anionic concentrations is 
small in comparison with the background concentration (i.e. electroneutrality). Under this condition, 
the electrical conductivity is linearly dependent of the background concentration. As a result, the 
diffusion equations of all individual species can be approximately replaced by the diffusion 
equation of electrical conductivity [10]:

where   is the electrical conductivity, V  the velocity, and effK  the effective diffusive 
coefficient. To exclusively manifest the effect of buoyancy force, the present study further assumes 
that the temperature variation due to Joule heating is small and the effects of temperature on fluid 
properties are neglected, such as the permittivity  , viscosity  , coefficient of thermal expansion 
 , constant pressure specific heat pc , and thermal conductivity  . Then we can employ the 
Boussinesq approximation to simplify the analysis. The governing equations describing the 
conservation of mass, free charge, momentum, and energy for such an electrohydrodynamic flow 
are written as [1, 10-12]

gravitational acceleration, P  the hydrostatic pressure, and 0  and 0T  are respectively the 
reference density and temperature at the boundaries. The second term on the right hand side of Eq. 
(5) indicates the heat source due to Joule heating. The variation in temperature field induces thermal 
buoyancy which is represented by the first term on the right hand side of Eq. (4). With the 
quasi-static electric assumption, the electric field E  and the free charge density f  can be 
further replaced by the electrical potential   as the following forms:

we derive the ranges of the dimensionless parameters as follows: 7Pr , 107 10~10 ,

63 10~10eSc , and

buoyancy, characterized by Prχτ e , is comparable to the electrical body force only when the 
parameter   is sufficiently large because the variation in the term Pre  is generally limited for 
most electrolyte solutions. Therefore, the parameter   is exclusively employed to characterize the 
effect of Joule heating. It is also noticed that the value of e  can be negative, provided that we 
reverse the system configuration to make the direction of Buoyancy is opposite to the electric field. 
Clearly, the sign of e  will affect the stability, which point will be further discussed in section III. 
To perform a linear stability analysis of this flow, we superimposed a small disturbance on the basic 
state solutions:

the flow of scale in centimeters, however, the magnitude of JHIB rises up to the order of )10( 1O , 
which is comparable to that of the electrical body force and thus will have certain impact on EHD 
flow. In this section, we consider the case of Pre )1(~ O  to manifest the effect of JHIB. The first 
case we examine is that the buoyancy acts in the same direction as the applied electric field. 
Secondly, the case with the direction of buoyancy opposite to the electric filed is studied. The 
results will provide a complete understanding of JHIB.  
 
3.1 Stability characteristics with the same direction in buoyancy and applied electric field 
To clarify the electric fields required for the onset of arbitrary disturbances in various 
situations, we illustrate in Figs. 3(a)-3(d) the variations of neutral curves on kQ   plane with   
for four typical values of H. The solid lines depict the stationary modes and the dashed lines 
represent the oscillatory modes. Above the neutral curves the system is unstable, corresponding to 
the parameter conditions. We first examine the results for the case at low conductivity increment, 
1H , as shown in Fig. 3(a). In the absence of Joule heating ( 0e ), the neutral curve appears in 
the form of oscillatory mode whatever the value of   is used. The minimum of Q occurs about at 
wavenumber 3.96. In this case the electrical force dominates the onset of instability and the critical 
mode tends to be traveling wave [11]. In the presence of Joule heating, the influence of JHIB is 
ignorable when the value of   is less than O(107) for the parameters given in Fig. 3. For  =108, 
the effect of JHIB becomes obvious. The minimum of the neutral curve gradually moves to the left 
and the corresponding oscillatory frequency decreases simultaneously. When   increases further, 
a loop of stationary mode will appear in the low wavenumber region and then dip lower than the 
oscillatory neutral curve. The loop descends quickly and extends to the right gradually, which 
replaces the oscillatory neutral curve to determine the critical mode at the onset of instability. 
Similar variation of neutral curves can be observed at the other three typical values of H in Figs. 
3(b)-3(d). These results show that the effect of buoyancy induced by JHIB will destabilize such an 
electrohydrodynamic flow significantly and make the stationary mode prevail over oscillatory mode 
even at low conductivity gradient conditions. It is noted that in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) the neutral curves 
of stationary mode of cases 1 and 2 are loops which constitute of lower and upper branches. The 
lower and upper branches are determined by the first and second leading eigenvalues, respectively. 
However, in cases 3 and 4 we illustrate the lower branch only. The neutral curve determined by the 
second leading eigenvalue has separated from the lower one in these conditions and thus has been 
omitted in these figures since it is not relevant to the determination of critical mode. 
The variation of the critical dimensionless electrical field strength cQ  with H is shown in Fig. 
4(a) and the corresponding variation of critical wavenumber ck  is shown in Fig. 4(b). One can see 
that at low conductivity gradient condition, the destabilizing effect due to the presence of JHIB is 
quite significant. For example, at 1H , the order of cQ  may decrease from O(10
5) to O(102) as 
  increases from O(10
8) to O(1010) . The tendency as H approaches zero also indicates that the 
instability of the fluid layer can still be enhanced by JHIB even though the electrical conductivity 
gradient is absent. In contrast, at high conductivity gradient condition, the destabilizing ability of 
JHIB lessens. The typical case at 100H  shows that the order of cQ  reduces from O(10
3) to 
O(102) only. It can be expected that the effect of JHIB will become insignificant for higher value of 
H  than 1000. These results can be explained by reviewing the base state solutions depicted in Fig. 
2. As seen in Fig. 2(d), the profiles of temperature show that the temperature difference between the 
fluid in the central part and that adjacent to the boundary is larger at low conductivity gradient 
condition. In Fig. 2(f), we also observe that the energy generation induced by Joule heating is more 
pronounced at the case of 1H . While at the case of 100H  the energy generation is mainly 
within the thin layer adjacent to the lower boundary and decays rapidly along the upward direction.

left branch. The corresponding oscillatory frequency deceases with   and finally reduces to zero 
turning into stationary mode. If the conductivity gradient increases further to 5H , the presence 
of JHIB initially turns out to be a stabilizing effect as seen in Fig. 6(b) for the curves 1-3. Note that 
in the case without Joule heating the critical mode is initially determined by the left loop of 
stationary mode. As   increases, the left loop recedes and the oscillatory mode extends and rises 
slightly which then becomes the critical mode. However, if   increases further, the JHIB turns to 
destabilize the fluid layer and the same variational processes as those in Fig. 7(a) are observed as 
seen in curves 3-4. At moderate value of H, for example, at 10H , the variations of neutral 
curves with   are somewhat different as demonstrated in Fig. 7(c). At the case of 810  (i.e. 
curve 2), the neutral curves are almost the same as those of the case without Joule heating (i.e. 
curve 1) which contains a loop of stationary mode and a branch of oscillatory mode. Once   
increases further, the loop gradually moves to the right and forms a closed loop as shown in the case 
of 910  (i.e. curve 3). Moreover, two branches of oscillatory mode exist on the right and left 
hand sides of the closed loop, respectively. The minimum on the closed loop still governs the 
determination of critical mode. If   reaches 1010 as indicated by curve 4, the lower part of the 
closed loop will expand to the right and separate from the upper part, forming a neutral curve like 
the cases of 1010  in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). Note that the instability mode is always dominated by 
the neutral curve of stationary mode and the minimum of Q rises slightly with   first, and then 
falls eventually. At high conductivity gradient condition as the typical case of 100H  shown in 
Fig. 7(d), the JHIB always exhibits a stabilizing effect on the fluid layer within the range of   
considered here. Apparently, the JHIB is of little significance until the parameter   exceeds 108. 
One can see that the neutral curve 3 begins to rise and the corresponding minimum location moves 
to the right gradually. Although an oscillatory mode grows gradually on the left portion of the curve, 
the stationary mode still dominates the onset of instability.  
The variations of cQ  and ck  with H for the four typical cases of   are respectively 
illustrated in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b). In comparison with Fig. 4(a), it is obvious that the influence of 
JHIB is more complicated when the applied electrical field and buoyancy have opposite directions. 
In this circumstance the downward electrically driving force is impeded by the upward buoyancy 
and the diffusion of ionic solutes. At low H conditions, the influences of diffusion effect and the 
electrical body force are relatively insignificant in comparison with JHIB. Consequently, an 
increase of   still produces a significant destabilizing effect on the fluid layer. At moderate H 
conditions, the upward buoyancy together with the effect of diffusion enhances the resistance to the 
downward electrically driving force. As a result, the stability of the fluid layer rises with increasing 
  initially as indicated in the cases with 810  and 109. However, if   increases further as the 
typical case of 1010 , the effect of JHIB prevails over the electrical body force and the diffusion 
effects and then dominates the onset of instability again. Note that the influence of JHIB still decays 
gradually with H in the present system configuration. Therefore, in Fig. 8(a) the curve 2 of the case 
810  almost overlaps on that of case without Joule heating in the region of high H value, and the 
curve 3 with 910  just lies slightly above the curve 2. Even though   increases to 1010 , it still 
exhibits a stabilizing effect to balance the electrically driving force. In Fig. 8(b), one can see that a 
discontinuity of ck  always occurs at the positions that the critical mode shifts from the oscillatory 
to the stationary mode. Besides, it is observed that for an assigned value of H, the critical 
wavenumber ck  will increase with increasing  , which is in opposite to the instability behaviors 
shown in Fig. 4(b). This result reveals that the variation of ck  is relevant to the direction of JHIB 
and indicates the corresponding variation of flow patterns is different from those shown in Fig. 5. 
The details of flow pattern variation are demonstrated in Figs. 9(I)-9(P), which correspond to 
the critical points I ~ P marked in Fig. 8(a). In the series of patterns (I)-(L), one can see that an 
enhancement of JHIB will shorten the wavelength gradually. Particularly, the center of convection 
cell appears to occur within the lower half of the fluid layer when the flow instability is primarily

Applying an electric ﬁeld across a ﬂuid layer with a conductivity gradient can induce an electrical body
force destabilizing the ﬂow and simultaneously generate Joule-heating effect. For microﬂuidic devices
with high surface area to volume ratio, the Joule heating can be removed and the onset of instability
occurs only when the electrical body force overcomes the viscous force. For mini-scale devices containing
conducting solutions, the Joule heating can induce thermal buoyancy sufﬁciently to affect the stability.
This paper performs an analysis to examine the possible impact on the stability due to the presence of
Joule-heating-induced buoyancy. Results show that for the cases of low conductivity gradient, the
induced buoyancy always appears to enhance the electrohydrodynamic instability regardless of the
direction of buoyancy. However, at high conductivity gradients, the buoyancy may become a stabilizing
mechanism if the electrical ﬁeld and the buoyancy are on the opposite direction.

1. Introduction
Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) is a subject that investigates the
phenomena of ﬂuid ﬂows in the presence of electrostatic force
[1]. Subjected to electric force, the ﬂuid ﬂow can become unstable
once the applied electric ﬁeld exceeds the threshold value [2–4].
The instability phenomena associated with EHD have yielded
numerous academic researches for several decades. Recently, its
applications received extensive attentions due to the demand on
high efﬁciency and accuracy for the manipulation of ﬂuids or sam-
ples in miniaturized channels [5–7].
The destabilizing mechanisms in EHD ﬂows mainly include the
dielectric force and the electrical body force due to the inhomoge-
neity of electrical properties in the ﬂuid. The dielectric force is pro-
duced by the inhomogeneous distribution of dielectric permittivity
in the presence of temperature gradient in dielectric ﬂuids [8],
while the electrical body force is induced by the electrical conduc-
tivity gradient due to either the temperature gradient in slightly
conducting liquids [9] or the variation of concentration in the
charge-carrying solutions [2,4–10]. Melcher and Firebaugh [9] ﬁrst
studied the electrohydrodynamic phenomena in the presence of
temperature gradient. They showed that if a temperature gradient
is imposed on a slightly conducting liquid, a gradient in natural
electrical conductivity generally results, and then applying an elec-
tric ﬁeld can induce charges in the liquid bulk. The charges interact
with the electric ﬁeld to form the electrical body force pumping the
ﬂuid particles, causing a type of instability observable in experi-
ments. Turnbull [8] investigated the effect of dielectric forces on
a ﬂuid heated from below and found that the presence of dielectric
forces reduces the critical temperature gradient required on the
onset of Bernard instability. Hoburg and Melcher [2–4] studied a
series of electrohydrodynamic instability problems concerning
with the diffusive of electrical conductivity at the interface
between two miscible ﬂuids. Both experimental observations and
theoretical calculation found that the mixing of ﬂuids is enhanced
at a higher applied ﬁeld and a higher conductivity gradient. Their
theoretical model was further extended by Baygents and Baldessari
[10] for the understanding of the unstable convection phenomena
occurring in isoelectric focusing experiments. Subsequent
researches including the effects of a weak shear ﬂow [11] and
rigid-body rotation [12] are also conducted to explore more insight
into electrohydrodynamic instabilities.
In addition to the electrical forces mentioned above, the Joule
heating generated by the internal electrical current in the bulk
ﬂuid is a secondary mechanism that affects the electrohydrody-
namic instability. The literature has revealed that Joule heating
can cause temperature variations in ﬂuids and change the ﬂow
motion and heat/mass transfer in microﬂuidic devices via the
temperature-dependent material properties, such as viscosity, per-
mittivity, electrical and thermal conductivities, and ionic concen-
tration [13,14]. In general, applying a high ﬁeld on a high
concentration buffer solution can greatly elevate the effect of Joule
heating. Good control and understanding of Joule heating therefore

obvious. The minimum of the neutral curve gradually moves to the
left and the corresponding oscillatory frequency decreases simulta-
neously. When s increases further, a loop of stationary mode will
appear in the low wavenumber region and then dip lower than
the oscillatory neutral curve. The loop descends quickly and ex-
tends to the right gradually, which replaces the oscillatory neutral
curve to determine the critical mode at the onset of instability.
Similar variation of neutral curves can be observed at the other
three typical values of H in Fig. 3(b)–(d). These results show that
the effect of buoyancy induced by JHIB will destabilize such an
electrohydrodynamic ﬂow signiﬁcantly and make the stationary
mode prevail over oscillatory mode even at low conductivity gradi-
ent conditions. It is noted that in Fig. 3(b) and (c) the neutral curves
of stationary mode of cases 1 and 2 are loops which constitute of
lower and upper branches. The lower and upper branches are
determined by the ﬁrst and second leading eigenvalues, respec-
tively. However, in cases 3 and 4 we illustrate the lower branch
only. The neutral curve determined by the second leading eigen-
value has separated from the lower one in these conditions and
thus has been omitted in these ﬁgures since it is not relevant to
the determination of critical mode.
The variation of the critical dimensionless electrical ﬁeld
strength Qc with H is shown in Fig. 4(a) and the corresponding var-
iation of critical wavenumber kc is shown in Fig. 4(b). One can see
that at low conductivity gradient condition, the destabilizing effect
due to the presence of JHIB is quite signiﬁcant. For example, at
H = 1, the order of Qc may decrease from O(105) to O(102) as s in-
creases from O(108) to O(1010). The tendency as H approaches zero
also indicates that the instability of the ﬂuid layer can still be en-
hanced by JHIB even though the electrical conductivity gradient
is absent. In contrast, at high conductivity gradient condition, the
destabilizing ability of JHIB lessens. The typical case at H = 100
shows that the order of Qc reduces from O(103) to O(102) only. It

electrical conductivity gradient develops across the ﬂuid layer with
higher conductivity on the lower surface. The basic state solutions
under such a circumstance are basically the same as the set of Eqs.
(8)–(13) by reversing the direction of z-axis since they are indepen-
dent of the gravity. To explore the inﬂuence of JHIB on the stability
characteristics we ﬁrst pay attention to the variations of neutral
curves as displayed in Fig. 7(a)–(d). Evidently, the stability charac-
teristics are quite different from those shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d) and
the JHIB does not always appear to be a destabilizing effect. As
shown in Fig. 7(a) at low conductivity gradient H = 1, an increase
in the effect of JHIB tends to make the neutral curve of oscillatory
mode become bimodal and still destabilize the ﬂuid layer since the
neutral curve descends gradually. The right branch determines the
minimum of Q and it dips lower faster than the left branch. The
corresponding oscillatory frequency deceases with s and ﬁnally re-
duces to zero turning into stationary mode. If the conductivity gra-
dient increases further to H = 5, the presence of JHIB initially turns
out to be a stabilizing effect as seen in Fig. 6(b) for the curves 1–3.
Note that in the case without Joule heating the critical mode is ini-
tially determined by the left loop of stationary mode. As s in-
creases, the left loop recedes and the oscillatory mode extends
and rises slightly which then becomes the critical mode. However,
if s increases further, the JHIB turns to destabilize the ﬂuid layer
and the same variational processes as those in Fig. 7(a) are ob-
served as seen in curves 3–4. At moderate value of H, for example,
at H = 10, the variations of neutral curves with s are somewhat dif-
ferent as demonstrated in Fig. 7(c). At the case of s = 108 (i.e. curve
2), the neutral curves are almost the same as those of the case
without Joule heating (i.e. curve 1) which contains a loop of sta-
tionary mode and a branch of oscillatory mode. Once s increases
further, the loop gradually moves to the right and forms a closed
loop as shown in the case of s = 109 (i.e. curve 3). Moreover, two
branches of oscillatory mode exist on the right and left hand sides
of the closed loop, respectively. The minimum on the closed loop

approximation to simplify the problem. The resultant eigenvalue
problem is then solved numerically by Chebyshev-collocation
method to depict the neutral curves for various parameter
conditions.
Result shows that for ﬂows in microchannels the effect of ther-
mal buoyancy is totally ignorable. However, increasing the scale of
the ﬂuid layer to centimeters or improving the electrical conduc-
tivity of ﬂuids, the induced buoyancy will become large enough
to compete with the electric body force. The stability phenomena
due to the coupled electric and thermal effects are quite different
from the previous studies [10,11]. When the conductivity gradient
is small, the JHIB always exerts a destabilizing effect on the ﬂuid
layer no matter the direction of buoyancy is the same or opposite
to that of the applied electrical ﬁeld. As the conductivity gradient
decreases, the destabilizing effect becomes more pronounced.
However, if the conductivity gradient is high, the JHIB may turn
to stabilize the ﬂuid layer when the applied electrical ﬁeld is in
the opposite direction. The physical mechanisms behind the
observed results have been elucidated in details, which should
have provided more insight to electrohydrodynamic stability
phenomena.
The present results have important implications in some elec-
trically-driven microﬂuidic systems dealing with the scales in the
order of centimeters, such as isoelectric focusing experiments
[10,12]. For example, consider the case of s = 1010, which is equiv-
alent to electrical conductivity r0 ¼ 0:1 S=m. The results discussed
in Fig. 4(a) have shown that the dimensionless critical electric ﬁeld
strength Qc can be reduced over three orders of magnitude once s
increases from 108 to 1010. This result is associated with a reduc-
tion of 97% in magnitude of the actually applied electric ﬁeld,
which implies the onset of EHD convection can be triggered at a
lower electric ﬁeld. Accordingly, reducing the geometric scale can
improve the efﬁciency for such a device, where unstable convec-
tion is undesired [12]. Further advanced study concerning the ef-
fects of temperature-dependent properties will be helpful for
providing a more complete understanding for the present electro-
hydrodynamic instability problem.
