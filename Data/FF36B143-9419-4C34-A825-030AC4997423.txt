(A) Q-switched and mode locked pulses generation in all normal dispersion Yb-doped fiber laser 
(YDFL) 
Experimental Setup 
Figure 1 shows the YDFL with ring cavity configurations used in our experiments.  The YDF has a length of 
3 m and an absorption coefficient of 80 dB/m near 975 nm.  A fiber-pigtailed laser diode (LD) is used as the 
pump source.  The laser diode (FITEL FOL0908A) has a center wavelength of 974 nm and maximum output 
power of 450 mW.  A fiber-type isolator is inserted in the cavity to assure unidirectional operation of laser 
oscillation.  The 10% port of a 10/90 coupler is used as the laser output.  In this laser, the combination of an 
in-line polarizer and a polarization controller (PC) works as the intensity-dependent loss mechanism, which is 
resulted from the nonlinear polarization evolution of intracavity pulses.  
 
Results and discussion 
The continuous-wave mode-locked (CW-ML) state of YDFL can be achieved by properly adjusting the PC 
for the NPE cavity in Fig. 1.  For LD pump power of 129 mW, the pulsewidth is 2.5 ns and the pulse

The SESAM has an unsaturated absorption of 30%, modulation depth of 20%, and high reflection band 
(reflectance >70%) within 1020 to 1110 nm.  The saturation fluence and relaxation time constant of this 
SESAM are 120 J/cm2 and 500 fs, respectively. 
 
 
Results and discussion 
 
For the hybrid mode locking of YDFL by NPE and SESAM in Fig. 4 various operation state including CW, 
QML, CML, pulse splitting and HML can be obtained by adjusting the LD pump powers.  In this cavity 
configuration, the effective loss modulation is determined by both NPE mechanism and SESAM.  The loss 
differences between split pulses might be reduced as the SESAM is insetted in the laser cavity to obtain the 
more equally spaced pulses or HML state.  Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the YDFL pulse train and RF 
spectrum for the 6th order HML.  The HML pulses have a repetition rate of 16.6 MHz, with center 
wavelength of 1041.9 nm and bandwidth of 2.0 nm.  In comparison with the spectrum of YDFL at pulse 
splitting state by the NPE only, the center wavelength of hybrid mode locked YDFL at HML sate has been 
shift about 10 nm towards longer wavelength, which should be resulted from the higher reflectivity of the 
SESAM used in this experiment at longer wavelengths. 
When the LD pump power was decreased, the state of YDFL laser was switched from the 6th order HML, 
through 5th, 4th, 3rd, and 2nd order HML, to the fundamental mode locking (FML) (Figs. 5 (c) to (l))).  The 
output pulse energy of 6th order HML and FML are estimated to be 6 and 10 pJ, respectively.  The relation 
between HML orders and pump powers are listedin table. The pulse repetition rate of fundamental 
mode_locking state is 2.8 MHz, corresponding to total cavity length of 71 m.  The pulsewidth of the 
fundamentally mode-locked laser pulses is about 1.5 ns or even shorter, for which the measurement is limited 
by the bandwidth of our oscilloscope.  Nevertheless, the pulsewidth is shorter than that of the NPE only 
cavity, which should be attributed to the pulse shortening effect provided by the SESAM.

Above certain threshold pump power, robust and stable CW-ML pulses can be produced in our laser 
system by properly rotating the PC angles.  Besides, our laser reveals turn-key self-starting behavior when 
the pump powers are above the threshold and can be maintained for many hours since the onset of pulse 
generation.  Fig. 7 (a) and Fig. 7(b) show the typical RF spectrum and CW-ML pulse trains, revealing that 
the time interval of sequential pulses is about 1.47 s and the pulse repetition rate is about 690 kHz. 
 
Figure 8(a) and 8(c) show the ML spectra for the 50:50 output coupler (black dash-dot curves) and 10:90 
couplers (red solid curves) with different PC tuning.  The corresponding expanded single pulses are shown in 
Fig. 8(b) and 8(d), respectively.  Although our laser is operated in the ANDi region, the spectra of CW-ML 
pulses will be broadened dramatically due to serious self-phase modulation (SPM) as the pulses propagating 
through relative long distance in the fiber.  The extension of ML spectrum for 50:50 coupler (black dash-dot 
curves) in Fig. 8(a) is over 80 nm, from 1017 nm to 1097 nm.  However, an apparent dip at about 1056 nm is 
appeared in the middle of the spectrum in Fig. 8(a).  According to the energy level of the Yb-doped gain 
medium, three-energy-level transition occurs for lasing around 1030 nm but it becomes nearly four 
energy-level around 1080 nm.  It might be the reason that results in this apparent dip. 
In our laser, the spectrum dip can be eliminated to result in more flattened spectrum like the red solid 
curve shown in Fig. 8(c) by properly rotating the PC.  This might be due to four wave mixing (FWM) as 
reported in supercontinuum generation in the birefringent microstructure fiber to result in more flat output 
spectrum [10].  The spectra for red and black curves are extended from 1020 nm to 1095 nm.  In comparing 
with the ML pulse generated with the cavity of 50:50 coupler (black dash-dot curve), optical spectrum 
generated with 90:10 coupler (red curve) is extended a little toward both longer and shorter wavelengths.  
This is due to SPM effect as the pulses passing through the relative long single-mode fiber with a larger 
intracavity power by 90:10 coupler.  
The corresponding time traces are shown in Fig. 8(b) and 8(d) (black dash-dot curves for 50:50 coupler 
and red solid curves for 10:90 coupler).  It is apparent to see that the pulse has a sharp peak in the leading 
edge but is broadened dramatically in the trailing edge and result in elative wide pedestal.  The 3-dB 
pulsewidth obtained from 50:50 coupler (red solid curves) are about 8 ns and 10 ns, respectively, but the 
expanded width at the pedestal are about 16 ns and 18 ns.  The cause of these dramatic pulse broadening 
might be due to the enormous intra-cavity normal dispersion as the pulses propagating through the relatively 
long cavity.  Therefore, the shorter wavelengths will propagate slower than the longer wavelengths to cause 
the broadening of the pulse.  The existence of pedestal might be due to the gain dynamics as pulses pass 
through the gain medium.  The gain saturation induced group velocity drift may drive the pulse toward the 
higher gain.  In comparison with the pulse shape obtained for 50:50 coupler the intensity of pulse at trailing

Results and discussion 
By properly rotating the PCs, the CW-ML pulse can be generated above certain threshold pump power.  
Figures 10 (a) and (b) show the RF spectrum and temporal trace of ML pulse trains, revealing that the pulse 
repetition rate is 460 kHz and time interval of sequential pulse is about 2.18 s.

At 192 mW pump power, 17.45 mW output power can be obtained from oscillator that corresponds 37.9 nJ 
pulse energy.  The generated optical spectrum at 192 mW pump power is shown in Fig. 11(a) that it extends 
from 1015 nm to 1093 nm.  However, an apparent dip can be seen in the middle between two spectrum 
peaks about 1028 nm and 1081 nm, respectively that might be due to energy level of Yb doped fiber.  
According to the energy level of Yb doped fiber, three-energy-lever transition occurs for lasing around 1030 
nm but it becomes four-energy-level around 1080 nm.  Figure 11 (b) shows that the corresponding time trace 
that reveals 3-dB pulsewidth is about 7ns.  Besides, it reveals obviously pedestal that might be due to pulse 
broadening as it propagate in relatively long cavity.  Due to enormous normal dispersion as pulse 
propagation inside resonator, short wavelength will propagate slower relative to the longer wavelength to 
result in this phenomenon.   After amplifier, the optical spectrum and expanded time trace are shown in Figs. 
12 (a) and (b).  As LD power below 300 mW, there is apparent loss occurring in optical spectrum due to 
absorption of YDF in amplifier, especially at short wavelength range in Fig. 12 (a) in comparing with that 
shown in Fig. 11(a) (black solid, and red dash curve).  Thus, the pedestal in corresponding time trace will 
disappear in Fig. 11(b) at lower LD pump power (black solid curve).  As pumping power increase, the 
generated spectrum will extend more in shorter and longer wavelength.  Besides, the spectrum dip between 
two peaks will be filled up due to four-wave mixing (FWM).  At 340 mW pumping power, the highest pulse 
energy about 185 nJ can be experimentally obtained.
