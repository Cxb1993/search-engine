1. Introduction 
The popularity of wireless services and the increasing demand for high data rate transmission 
have urged the development of broadband printed antennas (BPAs). Conventional BPA 
structures, such as aperture-stacked patch antennas and log-periodic dipole antennas 
introduced in [1][2], require either multilayer substrates or twisted feed lines, which increase 
the antenna complexity and the fabrication cost as well. Moreover, the multiple-element 
antenna technology has become a breakthrough research topic in modern wireless 
communications. However, the mutual coupling effect between multi-antenna elements would 
increase sidelobe levels, reduce gain, cause impedance mismatch and scan blindness [3]. 
In this paper, the printed dipole elements fed by the CBCPW-to-CPS transition [4] are mostly 
placed on one side of the substrate. Due to the uniplanar configuration, the layout alignment 
on both sides of the structure is eliminated and thus makes the fabrication process easier 
compared with the double-sided printed strip antenna [5]. The 100% bandwidth of the 10-dB 
return loss and the end-fire radiation with front-to-back ratio larger than 15 dB are calculated 
and measured and a good agreement between these results is observed. Moreover, the mutual 
coupling effect between two series-fed dipole antennas, which is represented as the two-port 
S-parameters of the antenna array, is studied. The spatial correlation coefficient between two 
antennas is calculated from the S-parameters as a function of antenna separation in 
face-to-face as well as in side-by-side configurations.

3.  Results and discussion 
In Figure 2, the measured and IE3D simulated return losses of the antenna shown in Fig. 1 
feature an operating impedance bandwidth of 100% from 1.5 to 4 GHz. The measured E-plane 
(xy-plane) and H-plane (yz-plane) radiation patterns are demonstrated in Figure 3. These 
patterns are end-fire in shape with a front-to-back ratio greater than 15 dB at 1.5, 2, and 2.5 
GHz. The similar radiation patterns at different operating frequencies and the 
cross-polarization less than â€“16 dB are not shown here for conciseness. The radiation 
mechanism of the proposed antenna is that a gradually expanding periodic array radiates most 
effectively when the dipole elements are near resonance so that the radiating region moves 
along the array with various frequencies. Hence, the radiation bandwidth is restricted to the 
lengths of the longest and the shortest dipole elements of the antenna array. To increase the 
radiation bandwidth, more printed dipoles with longer and shorter lengths have to be added to 
the array elements. The corresponding current distributions of the dipole elements are 
presented in [6]. The measured antenna gain is about 4.5-9.1 dB between 1.75 and 4 GHz as 
shown in Figure 4. 
4. Conclusions 
A printed antenna comprising the series-fed dipoles and the CBCPW-to-CPS balun with broad 
bandwidth has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The end-fire radiation 
patterns with a gain of about 4.5-9.1 dBi have also been measured within the operating 
frequency range. Mutual couplings of two identical series-fed dipole antennas in face-to-face 
as well as in side-by-side configurations were measured and found to vary significantly with 
frequency and antenna separation, The signal correlation coefficient obtained form 
S-parameters of the two-antenna array is lower than 0.04 in the operating band. The presented 
method can be utilized in array systems for the compensation or exploitation of mutual 
coupling. The proposed antenna is applicable for the high-gain multi-antenna system with the 
advantages of broad bandwidth, low cost, and easy fabrication.
