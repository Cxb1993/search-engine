  Characterization and Monte Carlo Analysis of Secondary 
Electrons Induced Program Disturb in a Buried Diffusion 
Bit-line SONOS Flash Memory 
                      
1.1 Preface 
Nitride based, localized charge trapping storage flash memory devices have 
received great interest due to superior performance than conventional floating gate 
memory devices. Recently, two bits per cell SONOS flash memories by utilizing 
channel hot electron program and band-to-band tunneling hot hole erase have been 
demonstrated with good performance and reliability, small die size and low 
fabrication cost [1][2]. A virtual ground array with n+ buried diffusion (BD) bit-lines 
is implemented to achieve a higher packing density [3]. The reliability issues of these 
memories and their physical mechanisms such as program-state charge loss, 
erase-state threshold voltage (Vt) drift and read disturb have been addressed in [2][4]. 
As the technology node is scaled beyond 50 nm, two new reliability issues due to 
number fluctuation of stored charges [5][6] and bit-line scaling are identified, which 
may impose a new constraint in cell scaling. 
First, as bit size aggressively shrinks, the number of programmed charges 
reduces. A single charge trapping/detrapping will induce a large fluctuation in read 
current. This current fluctuation, referred to as random telegraph noise, has become a 
major concern in advanced CMOS technologies [7] and will cause retention loss tail 
bits in a SONOS flash [5]. Second, previous studies have shown that, in channel hot

1.2.2 Program Disturb in a NOR-type SONOS Memory 
Bit B in cell (N-1) is a programmed bit. Bits C and bit D in cell (N) sharing the 
same word-line are disturbed bits. The program bias voltages are given in Table 1.1, 
where VBL is the bit-line voltage and VWL is the word-line voltage. During channel hot 
electron programming, the VWL is 9V, the VBL(N-1) and VBL(N) are 0V and 4.2V 
respectively while VBL(N+1) is kept floating. Fig. 1.3 measures the Vt evolutions of two 
neighboring cells, i.e. cell (N-1) and cell (N), during programming for two different 
BD width splits. A reverse-read scheme with a bit-line voltage of 1.6V is employed 
[1]. It is obvious that for a larger bit-line width, i.e. 0.25 μm, no program disturb is 
observed. However, for a 0.12μm bit-line width, a significant program disturb is 
observed, i.e. bits C and D. As a consequence, this program disturb will become a new 
constraint in bit-line scaling. In addition, the program disturb is apparently more 
serious for a larger program window. 
 
1.2.3 Mechanisms for the Program Disturb 
  Two possible mechanisms for the program disturb are illustrated in Fig. 1.4. One 
is secondary electron generation by impact ionization. In channel hot electron 
programming, channel electrons gain energy from a large electric field. These high 
energy electrons induce a first impact ionization near the drain junction and the 
generated holes are accelerated by the drain-to-substrate voltage. The hot holes induce 
a second impact ionization and generated secondary electrons may flow to a 
neighboring cell, i.e. disturbed cell, and cause a program disturb. The other possible 
mechanism is substrate electron generation via re-absorption of channel hot electron 
emitted light. The main cause of the program disturb will be identified later. 
 
 5
surfaces of the MC window are treated as reflective boundaries. Each electron or hole 
is simulated until it either produces an impact ionization event or passes out of the 
MC window. When an impact ionization event takes place, the energy of each 
electron or hole minus the band-gap energy is shared by the three created secondaries. 
Moreover, the hot electron injection is simulated by counting the electrons hitting the 
Si and SiO2 interface with energy larger than the effective barrier height.  
 
1.4 Results and Discussions 
1.4.1 Spatial Distribution of Secondary Hot Electrons 
A multi-step Monte Carlo simulation is performed at a program condition of 
VWL=9V and VBL(N)=4.2V. First, electrons are launched at the source in cell (N-1) and 
primary impact ionization events are simulated (Fig. 1.7 (a)). It is obvious that most of 
primary impact ionization events take place near the drain junction where the lateral 
electric field is the largest. In the second step, holes are launched at primary impact 
ionization sites and secondary impact ionization events are simulated (Fig. 1.7 (b)). It 
is found that the secondary impact ionization extends into the substrate. In the third 
step, electrons are launched at the secondary impact ionization sites and hot electron 
injection into both cell (N-1) and cell (N) is simulated (Fig. 1.7 (c)). A random sample 
of 50 impact ionization events is chosen in Fig. 1.7 (a) and (b). A random sample of 
500 secondary hot electrons with energy above 2.5 eV is displayed in Fig. 1.7 (c). It is 
found that Fig. 1.7 (c) confirms the flowing of some secondary electrons into cell (N), 
which is the cause of the program disturb.  
To gain insight into the program disturb path, the MC simulated trajectories of 
secondary electron injection are shown in Fig. 1.8. For path 1, a generated secondary 
electron injects into the nitride of cell (N-1), resulting in the increase of Vt (bit B) in 
 7
voltages. Two points are worth noting. First, as programmed bit ΔVt raises, the 
effective barrier height increases due to the build-up of program charges in the nitride 
layer. As a result, in the initial stage of programming, CHE injection is dominant. 
Then, due to the decrease of CHE significantly during programming, CHISEL 
injection becomes dominant [9]. Second, for a larger programming word-line voltage, 
i.e. VWL=10.5V, CHE is more dominant in the programming transient and the role of 
CHISEL is played down, which implies that the program disturb can be reduced by 
appropriate program bias optimization. Then we re-plot Fig. 1.3 (b) to Fig. 1.12 (a). 
Two-stage behavior is observed. In the initial stage of programming, the program 
disturb is negligible. The charge injection rate in the programmed cell is larger than 
that in the disturbed cell. The reason is that CHE is dominant in this stage. However, 
the disturbed bit ΔVt increases drastically for a program bit ΔVt above 3.0V. The 
reason is that CHISEL becomes dominant in this stage. Fig. 1.12 (b) shows the 
normalized Ninj in the disturbed cell during programming from a MC simulation. A 
similar trend from the measurement and simulation is obtained. 
 Taking into account an electron energy distribution from the MC simulation and 
the effective barrier height, the spatial distribution of Ninj in the programmed cell and 
in the disturbed cell is shown in Fig. 1.13 and Fig. 1.15, respectively at a program 
level of 3.0V, i.e. ΔVt(bit B)=3.0V. In the programmed cell, the injected charges have 
a tight distribution near the drain, as shown in Fig. 1.13. The injected charge also 
affects the threshold voltage of bit A, which is referred to as second bit effect [22]. It 
is found that CHISEL broadens the injected charge distribution, and thus has an 
adverse effect on the second bit effect, as indicated in Fig. 1.14. Unlike in a 
programmed cell, however, Fig. 1.15 shows that the injected charges in the disturbed 
cell spread over the entire channel, that both bits C and D are affected, which is 
 9
more secondary electrons are indeed found in the disturbed cell for a shallower BD 
junction. However, it is possible that the program disturb can be reduced in a recessed 
buried source/drain SONOS memory, which has a shallower bit-line depth. 
On the other hand, the MC simulation shows a strong dependence on a BD 
bit-line width. The result is shown in Fig. 1.20. The Ninj in the disturbed cell increases 
by two orders as a bit-line width reduces from 0.25μm to 0.1μm. As a consequence, 
the program disturb becomes a new constraint as the technology node advances.  
  
1.4.5 Pocket Implant Effect 
In Fig. 1.21, we evaluate the effect of pocket implant on the program disturb. The 
dosages of two pocket implant splits differ by two times. It is found that, for a higher 
pocket dose, the secondary impact ionization region moves deeper into the substrate 
due to a larger substrate field. As a result, secondary electrons have a larger chance to 
go around a buried diffusion drain and inject into the disturbed cell, leading to a larger 
program disturb. Therefore, it appears that there is a trade-off between punch-through 
and the program disturb.  
 
1.5 Summary 
 In this chapter, a new program disturb in a scaled BD bit-line SONOS array is 
demonstrated. Our Monte-Carlo simulation confirms that the program disturb is 
attributed to the impact ionization-generated secondary electrons flowing to a 
neighboring cell. This program disturb becomes more serious as cell or bit-line 
scaling advances. The factors affecting the program disturb are summarized in Table 
1.2. The characteristics of the program disturb can be well simulated by a 
Monte-Carlo code. Optimization of pocket implant, bit-line geometry and operation

when the BD region is narrow and is attributed to the non-equilibrium transport across 
the BD region where the electric field is almost zero. With the electron energy 
boosting at the source, channel electrons in a program cell exhibit higher 
programming efficiency. 
In this work, we first compare the programming speeds of our method and two 
conventional hot electron program methods. The electron pre-acceleration effect and 
program disturb are characterized. Furthermore, the concept of our method is verified 
through a MC simulation. The impact of a bit-line width is also characterized and 
evaluated. 
 
2.2 A Novel Hot Electron Programming Method 
A virtual-ground SONOS array was fabricated. The gate length is 0.1 μm and the 
BD width is 0.1 μm. Fig. 2.2 (a) and (b) show the cross section and top view of a 
buried diffusion bit-line SONOS array, respectively. The program bias voltages are 
given in Table 2.1. The bias conditions of two conventional hot electron program 
methods (methods B and C) are also shown in Table 2.1 for a comparative study. 
Method B has CHISEL injection [8] while method C does not have CHISEL. It 
should be mentioned that the drain-to-source voltage on a program cell in this method 
is 2.5V. 
 
2.2.1 Programming Speed 
The programming speeds of this method and two conventional methods are 
compared in Fig. 2.3. The Vds in a program cell is fixed at 2.5V in all the methods. A 
reverse-read scheme with a bit-line voltage of 1.6V is employed. Obviously, our 
method has a faster programming speed, as compared to the conventional methods 
 37
To simulate non-equilibrium transport in the n+ BD region and an electron 
residual energy distribution, a coupled Monte Carlo and two-dimensional numerical 
device simulation is performed [19]. In the simulation, the electric field distributions 
in cells (N-1) and (N) are obtained from a two-dimensional device simulator. Fig. 2.6 
shows the potential distribution along the channel. The Monte Carlo simulation 
includes a full band structure, consisting of a conduction band structure [16] and a 
valence band structure [17]. The relevant scattering mechanisms in the simulation 
include acoustic phonon scattering, intervalley optical phonon scattering and impact 
ionization. The carrier scattering parameters were calibrated in our earlier paper 
[19][20]. 
 
2.3.2 Bit-line Width Effect 
The dependence of BD width on a program Vt window is characterized in Fig. 
2.7. Two different BD width splits, 0.1 μm and 0.12 μm, were fabricated. The smaller 
BD width apparently has higher injection energy and thus a larger program Vt 
window. 
We further utilize a MC simulation to evaluate the BD width effect. Electrons are 
launched at the source of cell (N-1) with a Boltzmann distribution in energy and are 
collected at the source of cell (N) after transmitting the n+ BD region. The 
MC-calculated electron energy distribution at the source of cell (N) is plotted in Fig. 
2.8 for different BD widths. It should be noted that the electron energy distribution 
apparently deviates from a Boltzmann distribution and exhibits a high-energy tail. 
Moreover, the high-energy tail becomes more pronounced as a BD width is reduced. 
The reason is that electrons acquiring energy in cell (N-1) cannot release their energy 
completely by means of phonon scatterings when passing through a narrow BD region.
