 1. Introduction 
The advent of the Internet and electronic communication has enabled companies to be more 
responsive to their customers. However, the uses of the same technological advancements in 
business-to-business supply chain management are changing the marketplace itself. Successful 
supply chain management requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating 
activities into the key supply chain process. The advantages are far more than the efforts involved 
in accessing the final product, a seamless chain that operates fluidly and benefits the entire value 
chain by speeding up communication between customers and their suppliers, improving service 
quality, and reducing costs (Rahman, 2004). One potential solution to this capability is RFID. 
Through the attachment of transponders or tags to animate or inanimate objects, and an 
infrastructure of networked reading devices, physically embodied information can be 
automatically recorded, discovered accessed among trading partners in global supply chain. 
RFID technology is a wireless form of automated identification technology that provides a 
quick, flexible and reliable way to electronically detect, track, and control a variety of physical 
objects. The actual idea of RFID has been around since 1960 (Weigart, 2000). RFID has existed 
for more than fifty years. In recent years, RFID has again attracted great attention due to 
technology advancements, heightened security concerns due to terrorists’ threats and a 
competitive business environment with emphasis on cost control and affordable RFID tag costs. 
The RFID technology was first used by the Allied forces to identify friend-or-foe aircraft 
during the World War II (Landt, 2001). A powerful and instant data capture solution as it is, the 
wide-spread use of which in the global supply chain is hampered by the absence of common 
standard. As the development of Electronic Product Code (EPC) becomes more mature and 
beginning to get embraced by global commerce, the full potential of EPC and RFID is unveiling. 
EPC is an industry standard for product identification (Brock, 2001). In many ways, it is 
similar to the EAN Barcode. The only difference between them is that EPC allows identification 
of items down to serial level, such as cases and pallets, which do not have EAN Barcode. Before 
mass adoption of the EPC standard could take place, the components of the standard need to be 
made available at an affordable cost. In order to drive down the cost of tags, the EPC number is 
the only piece of information stored in the RFID tag, which is made up of a microchip attached to 
an antenna. During the automatic data capture process, the EPC is read by RFID reader via radio 
waves, the data will then pass on to the EPC middleware. With internet-based back-end 
infrastructure, wide adoption of the EPCglobal network will create an "Internet of Things" to 
enable all parties in the chain to draw or share real-time product information over the Internet. 
EPCglobal is leading the development of industry-driven standards for the EPC to support 
the use of RFID in today’s fast-moving, information rich trading networks (Tan, 2004). The 
EPCglobal Network is a method for using RFID technology in the global supply chain by using 
inexpensive RFID tags and readers to pass EPC numbers, and then leverages the existing internet 
infrastructure to create a low-cost, standards-based set of services for trading partners to discover 
and access large amounts of information associated with each EPC and shared among authorized 
users. It is made up of five main elements: 1) the identification system – RFID system, 2) RFID 
 2. Related work 
RFID system and EPCglobal Network are the ‘next big thing’ for Supply Chain trading 
partners and in 2005 many supply chain trading partner organizations will be moving from 
evaluating the business case for RFID to starting plans for pilot or full-scale deployment (Sharp, 
2003). Gillette is one of the forerunners in EPC and RFID technologies. The Company launched 
its EPC warehouse pilot in 2003 in pursuit of a more closely integrated value chain. EPC was 
applied in items, cases and pallets throughout the warehouse to expedite the movement of goods 
in every critical checkpoint in the go down including goods receiving, order picking, order 
verification process. Results of the pilot were enough to impress the meanest financial controller 
(Zhekun et al., 2004). In following section, we present a brief overview of the EPCglobal 
Network; reasons why Web Services is as a pivotal role in helping organizations to integrate new 
RFID applications into existing supply chain systems and share data; and explain a brief 
overview of WSS. They will serve as a basis for secure framework we proposed in section 3. 
2.1 EPCglobal Network 
The EPCglobal Network provides the open loop, standards based environment required for 
global exchange of EPC information. The EPCglobal Network is composed of five key elements 
(EPCglobal Inc, 2004): 
1. Identification system – RFID system 
2. RFID middleware - the Savant 
3. EPC Information Services (EPC-IS, formerly called PML Server) 
4. EPC Discovery Services (EPC-DS) 
5. Object Name Services (ONS) 
Figure 1 illustrates the high-level components of the EPCglobal network architecture inside 
the enterprise and Figure 2 shows the EPCglobal network architecture across enterprises 
(Harrison, 2004). The EPCglobal network is based on the following principles (Tan, 2004): 
1. Inexpensive tags and readers that conform to standard specification and to the local air 
interface protocols, which vary depending on country or region. 
2. Minimum information stored on the tag. Under the pure EPC vision, the only 
information stored on the tag would be the EPC number. 
3. The use of software called a savant, to act as a connecting layer between the reader and 
application to filter the EPC data and pass on only appropriate product movement 
information to application systems. 
4. Information related to each object is securely stored on a public network with the 
appropriate security controls. It can be accessed when required through the ONS that 
point to a computer where the information about the object is held. The EPC-IS on that 
computer will provide a description of the product in Physical Markup Language 
(PML). 
 
Figure 2 EPCglobal Network architecture – across enterprises 
 
The root ONS provides the location of the manufacturer's ONS, which in turn provides the 
location of the manufacturer's EPC-IS. This query process is transparent to the supply chain 
member and takes only milliseconds to execute. With the manufacturer's EPC-IS location, the 
distributor's application can request specific product information. As products progress through 
the supply chain, they are in constant communication with the EPC-IS. The result is real-time full 
visibility of the supply chain. The ONS is the "glue" that holds the EPCglobal Network together; 
this service tracks every EPC-IS and EPC-DS (Mealling, 2004). Only authorized users have 
access to complete, up-to-the minute intelligence about any product. 
2.2 Threats to data security in the EPCglobal Network 
RFID has recently received a lot of attention as an augmentation technology in 
manufacturing, SCM, and retail inventory control. However, widespread deployment of RFID 
system in EPCglobal Network may create new threats to security and privacy of individuals and 
organizations (Shih et al, 2005). Security in the EPCglobal Network is a growing and valid 
concern. Figure 3 illustrates threats to data security in the EPCglobal Network. Threats to data 
security are as follows (Pappu, 2003): 
1. Corporate espionage threat - espionage via supply chain dynamics, 
2. Trust perimeter threat - broadening of perimeter because of data sharing via networks, 
3. Competitive marketing threat - customers are revealed to competitors, 
4. Infrastructure threat - DOS, jamming, physical damage, counterfeit tags and so on. 
 
and cost of developing new applications. For these reasons, analysts who follow RFID 
technology believe Web Services will play a pivotal role in helping organizations integrate new 
RFID applications into existing supply chain systems and share data about product location, 
ordering and inventory with suppliers and customers (Violino, 2003). 
 
 
Figure 4 the early way of RFID system exchange information 
2.4 Web Services Security 
Web Services provide an API that allows other applications on remote computers even if 
those applications are written in different languages or on different operating systems to exchange 
data. The data is exchanged in an XML format, usually transported using SOAP structured in 
HTTP and often transmitted over the Internet automatically. Rather than granting a business 
partner direct access to its databases, a company can employ a Web Service that allows others to 
access a restricted part of its data or perform only specified operations or queries. 
 
Web Services Security (WS-Security or WSS) is a new protocol jointly developed by 
Microsoft and IBM (Short, 2001). Figure 5 shows the WSS standards built on SOAP. As a quick 
review, the goal of WSS is to enable applications to construct secure SOAP message exchange. 
WSS itself does not provide methods for security protocols; rather it’s an extensible framework 
into which other defined security protocols and models can be applied covering: multiple security 
tokens for authentication and authorization, multiple trust domains, multiple encryption 
technology and full end-to-end message level security. It is designed to address message integrity, 
message confidentiality, message authentication, and the encoding of security tokens that must 
travel with the messages they are securing. There are presently three main ways of implementing 
security for Web Services through the WSS protocol: 1) XML Signature, 2) XML Encryption, 3) 
Encoding of binary tokens (Rosenberg and Remy, 2004). WSS is not the only available means of 
securing Web Services, but it is the most prominent new standard designed specifically to address 
Web Services security challenges. 
 
 
 continue to work with customers, partners and industry wide to provide follow-on more 
sophisticated scenarios for federated security which include secure conversations 
(WS-SecureConversation), federated trust (WS-Federation), and authorization 
(WS-Authorization).

A document specifying a service name must contain the following template. This template is 
then entered into the registry as soon as the document is published (Mealling, 2004). 
1. Service Name: The exact sequence of characters that will appear in the Service field. 
2. Functional Specification: A pointer to publicly available documentation for the 
service. 
3. Valid URI schemes: A list of registered URI schemes those are valid for this service. 
For example, Web Services can be specified using either the 'http:' or 'https:' scheme.

 Binding Secure EPCglobal Network with WS-Security 
During the past years, many businesses began working together on pilot projects for 
achieving the big benefits RFID technology offers and beginning to understand and address the 
issues surrounding the deployment of EPCglobal network. However, under industry wide 
EPCglobal Network, collaborative working in construction projects is becoming very important 
as many activities are usually performed involving actors based in different geographical 
locations (Bouchlaghem et al, 2004). Recent years have seen the emergence and development of 
a plethora of visual software modeling tools, modeling standards, methods for wide enterprise 
concurrent engineering, and techniques for exchanging and sharing construction information 
between software applications (Helo and Szekely, 2005). Roberti (2004) shows three models of 
teamwork that can work in many industries. Broadly speaking, the models fall into three broad 
categories: 1) One-to-one Collaboration, 2) Cross-Supply Chain Collaboration, 3) Industry and 
Standards Groups. 
One-to-One Collaboration means when one or a few major companies dominate an 
industry, these so-called channel masters can drive collaboration. For example, Boeing and

Figure 9 the four cases in across trust EPCglobal Network domains 
3.3.1 CASE 1 
This case illustrates the use of a security token that is directly trusted by a Web Service. In 
one-to-one models of EPCglobal Network, direct trust means that the Retailer's security token is 
known and trusted by the Manufacturer’s EPC-IS. Here we assume that Retailer and 
Manufacturer have used some mechanism to establish a trust relationship for use of the security 
token. Below we inspect two variable situations. The Web service requestors are assumed to 
understand the new security mechanisms and be capable of interacting with Web service 
providers. 
Case 1(a) 
Figure 10(a) below illustrates one approach where the Manufacturer’s EPC-IS uses a 
validation service from its STS. In this case, security tokens from the Retailer's trust realm are 
used to access the Manufacturer’s EPC-IS. The Retailer sends message includes a signed security 
token and provides proof-of-possession of the security token using, for example, a signature. 
Manufacturer’s EPC-IS uses its STS to verifies the proof and evaluates the security token 
received from the Retailer’s EPC-IS. The signature on the security token is valid and is directly 
trusted by the service. The Manufacturer’s EPC-IS processes the request and returns a result. 
Figure 10(b) depicts a common sequence of events: 
Step 1: Acquire Policy 
If the Retailer doesn’t already have the policy for the service from the Manufacturer, it 
can obtain it using the mechanisms defined in WS-Policy to acquire policy. WS-Policy 
strives to provide a mechanism for exchanging security requirements between a Web Service 
client and a Web Service provider. 
Step 2: Return Policy 
The requested policy is returned using the mechanisms defined in WS-Policy. 
Step 3: Request Security Token 
The Retailer requests a security token from its STS and optional proof of possession 
information using the mechanisms defined in WS-Trust. 
Step 4: Issue Security Token 
The STS returned a security token and optional proof of possession information using 
the mechanisms defined in WS-Trust. 
 
Manufacturer’s EPC-IS and the Manufacturer’s STS return a token. Both of using the 
mechanisms defined in WS-Trust. Afterward the Retailer sends the request to the service 
attaching and securing the message using the issued tokens as described in WS-Security.

3.3.2 CASE 2 
In both of the above examples, a trust relationship has been established between the token 
services. Alternatively, as illustrated in Figure 12(a), there may not be a direct trust relationship, 
but an indirect trust relationship that relies on a third-party to establish and confirm trust. In other 
words, indirect trust means that the Retailer's security token is known and trusted by the 
Manufacturer’s EPC-IS through a 3rd – party STS in one-to-one models of EPCglobal Network. 
The Figure 12(b) below illustrates a sequence of events. In EPCglobal Network, an active 
Retailer is attempting to access a service which require security authentication to be validated by 
the Manufacturer’s STS. After they exchange each other security policy, it finds there is no trust 
between Retailer’s and Manufacturer’s STS but all of both are trust a 3rd-Party STS. Retailer must 
use its security token to get security token from 3rd – party STS be trust by Manufacturer’s STS. 
The Retailer requests a security token from the Manufacturer’s STS using its security token for 
the Manufacturer’s EPC-IS. If the result which Manufacturer’s STS verified security token 
through 3rd-Party is accept, then it returns a token. Afterward the Retailer sends the request to the 
service attaching and securing the message using the issued tokens as described in WS-Security.

In this case, Retailer’s EPC-IS may need product data from Manufacturer and Distributor. 
An active retailer is attempting to access services, which require security authentication to be 
validated by their respective STS. The Figure 13(b) below illustrates a sequence of events. Step 1 
to step 4 is the same sequence of events as Step 1 to 2 above-mentioned Case 1(a). If the Retailer 
doesn’t already have the policy for the service from the Manufacturer and Distributor, it can 
obtain it using the mechanisms defined in WS-Policy to acquire policy. The Retailer requests a 
security token from its STS and optional proof of possession information using the mechanisms 
defined in WS-Trust and STS returned a security token, shown as Step 5 and 6. Step 7 and 8 is 
the Retailer requests a security token from the Manufacturer’s STS for the Manufacturer’s 
EPC-IS and the Manufacturer’s STS return a token. Both of using the mechanisms defined in 
WS-Trust. Afterward the Retailer sends the request to the service attaching and securing the 
message using the issued tokens as described in WS-Security and/or WS-SecureConversation. 
Step 11 to step 14 do likewise. After all data are searched and collected, Retailer’s EPC-IS 
combined these return results and show in browser. 
Case 3(b1) 
In industry wide EPCglobal Network, Retailer may request Manufacturer to provide the 
information about life of product across supply chain. In order to response a Retailer’s EPC-IS 
request, Manufacturer’s EPC-IS may need to access other EPC-IS from partner across supply 
chain. Delegated resource access defined where a resource access data from another resource on 
behalf of the resource. Similarly, in response to a Retailer’s EPC-IS request a Manufacturer’s 
EPC-IS may need to access other EPC-IS such as Distributor, on behalf of the requestor as 
illustrated in Figure 14(a). Here we assume that Retailer and Manufacturer have used some 
mechanism to establish a trust relationship for use of the security token. The Figure 14(b) 
illustrates a sequence of events.

It should be noted that there are a number of variations on this scenario. For example, 
Distributor’s STS may only have a trust relationship with the token service from the Retailer’s 
STS, as opposed to the figure below where the trust doesn't exist between Manufacturer’s STS 
and Distributor’s STS. In such cases, as illustrated in Figure 15(a), Manufacturer’s STS provide 
security tokens to allow/indicate proof of delegation. The Figure 15(b) below illustrates a

一、 參加會議經過 
8月 19日，懷著一顆朝聖的心，搭中華航空班機飛研討會舉辦地點香港Miramar Hotel，飛
機上亦有其他大學師生同行。抵香港已近下午 5 點，隨即辦理報到事宜，領取論文集並與主辦
單位了解整個研討會概況。 
8 月 20 日，辦理報到並參加相關議題討論。本次研討會共分 66 個場次進行，內容涵蓋
Adaptive systems, Neural nets and support vector machines, Business intelligence, Hybrid and 
nonlinear systems, Project management, Fuzzy theory, control and systems, Data and web mining, 
Multimedia Information retrieval, Intelligent agent, Intelligent and knowledge based systems, 
Financial engineering, Sample and feature selection, Inductive learning, Networking and information 
security, Geoinformatics, Evolutionary computation, Power supply, Ensemble methods, Logistics, 
Information fusion, Intelligent control, Visual information processing等等主題，皆是當前最熱門的
一些研究領域。09:00-11:00 耹聽 Dr. James Tien, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA, Keynote
SessionA: " Real-Time Systems: When Services and Products Become Indistinguishable "，與 Dr. Lei 
Xu, Chinese University of HK, Hong Kong Keynote Session B: " A Unified Perspective on Advances 
of Independent Subspaces: Basic, Temporal, and Local Structures "，並參加爾後之相關議題討論。
8月 21日， 08:30-09:30,  Shuguo Wang, President, Harbin Institute of Technology, China, 主
持一個主題“" Robotics Research at HIT: From Industrial Robotics to Service Robotics"。
09:30-10:30,  Michael Berthold, University of Konstanz, Germany, 主持另一個主題“" Learning 
what to Ask: Active Classification of Cell Assay Images ", 由與會的中外學者，互相討論簡介種種
進展與問題。筆者並參加爾後之相關議題討論。最令筆者感到興趣的主題是 11:15- 13:00 PM , 
TA-1  Intelligent Interface Systems&  , 其中有 4篇 "Content Recommendation System Based On 
Private Dynamic User Profile", Ting Chen, "A Virtual Button Interface Using Fingertip Movements", 
Kazuhiro Morimoto, "Designing For Usability And Safety In RFID-Based Intelligent Commuting 
Environments", Shinichi Konomi, "Clickcatalog: Retracing Precious Memory Using Paper-Based 
Media Controller", Akinori Komaki, 筆者分別提出這 4篇論文之缺點與看法，主持人亦點頭稱許
筆者論點，與會學者亦提出未來科技之相關疑問，互相討論切磋。筆者挾帶博士班學生於
Intelligent Systems III, 13:00pm-14:45pm 發表論文，'' An intelligent ECG reasoning system for the 
elderly ''，吸引幾位學者耹聽，與會學者亦表達這篇論文之優缺點與看法，其中主持人特別在意
論文的構想與由來，筆者亦鉅細靡遺據以告之，收穫亦不少。晚上7:30 PM - 22:00 PM參加 ICMLC
2007所設的接待晚晏，賓主盡歡。 
8 月 22 日， 參加爾後之相關議題討論，下午研討會已近尾聲，研討會人數漸少，彼此互
道珍重，相約明年相見。 
 
二、 與會心得與建議 
綜觀本次研討會，論文接受率不高，台灣的學者約有八十幾篇文章參加，其中台灣的學
者師生佔大多數，而大陸學者人數次之。經由與各地學者交談與交換意見，深覺台灣的研究
水準，並不輸外國學者，欠缺者可能是文章撰寫表達能力與信心，假以時日，藉由多多參與
國際研討會，我們的研究水準應可蒸蒸日上，凌駕他國之上。 
學界應多鼓勵博士生出過參加研討會，不但促使學生具有投稿國際研討會的能力，更能
經由國際交流，提升台灣的學者本身的能力。除此之外，透過這樣的交流方式也能提昇台灣
學校學術研究的知名度與國際上的能見度，因此建議學界多加宣導這樣利多的消息給予各系
所的博士生，讓博士生能善加利用這樣的資源。
