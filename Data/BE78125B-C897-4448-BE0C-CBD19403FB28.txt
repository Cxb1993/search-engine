for cells of interest. Simultaneously, it is important that the environment also 
is designed to enable effective detection of multiple parameters of cell in real 
time as a function of environmental changes with integration of electrical 
functionality, and integration of optical functionality in a parallel fashion.  
In recent years, the general methods used to cell capture are mechanical 
trapping, electric trapping and optical tweezers. However, electric trapping [3], 
such as DEP (Dielectrophoretic) [4] [5], employs the electrophysiological 
characteristics of cells to separate them [6] or capture single cell. High 
voltage and high magnetic field will apply to the cells. The electric and 
magnetic field might be damaging to the cells under measuring. Optical 
tweezers are used to capture single cell and direct the cell to the desired 
position [7]. Laser trapping in the near infrared regime is a noninvasive and 
micro-fluidic compatible biomedical tool which has been widely applied for 
physiological studies of biological cells [8] and organelles. The laser beam of 
optical tweezers might damage the cells [9]. The optical laser might change 
the metabolism of cell, such as light-driven cells or anti-light driven cells.  
All the electrical, magnetic and optical methods to capture or separate cells 
have more or less influence on cells, metabolism, reaction, and cell’s ion 
channel as well. As the result, we introduce the mechanical trapping method 
to this design to avoid pushing the cells under testing to change its properties. 
In order to reduce the damage of cells, a method using simple three-pillar 
microstructures as a passive way to capture the single cells physically without 
other effects on the cell is developed.

1-2 Advantage of this Work  
The integration of CMOS and MEMS has potential in biosensors which 
can be adopted to measure multiple parameters in small colonies of living 
cells in real time [11] [12]. Many restrictions of in vitro extra cellular 
measurements such as the limitation in the number of interconnect lines or the 
low signal levels can be addressed by introducing CMOS technology into the 
field of cell-based biosensors. This project presents a design of a 
CMOS-based impedance sensor with MEMS structures to conduct the capture 
and impedance measurement of single cervical cancer cells. This device uses 
simple three-pillar microstructures as a passive way to capture single cells 
physically without other effects on the cell. It is easy and cheap for fabrication 
and measurement. Additionally, it can be integrated with other components to 
expand its applications. 
The sensor consists of cell-trapping structures and amplifiers fabricated by 
CMOS process. There are several obstacles to filter out the cell debris and 
three micro pillars to capture the cell. Classical materials of standard CMOS 
processes such as aluminum are not biocompatible, so in many cases the 
standard CMOS backend has to be modified and extended by additional 
process steps. Therefore, the aluminum electrodes are covered by Al2O3 to 
increase biocompatibility in the post IC (Integrated circuit) fabrication 
process. The PDMS is used to top the circuits such as Metal3 and Metal4 in 
0.35 μm 2P4M (Two-poly-four-metal). Additionally, it forms microchannels 
with the CMOS chip by RIE (Reactive ion etching) process. Finally, the wire 
bonding of the chip is carried out to construct a package IC [13]. Cells with

the PAD communicating the circuits inside IC and the instrument out from IC. 
Metal3 and Metal4 are used for the protection of the circuits and electrodes 
from damage. The microchannel is designed in this IC and presents as SiO2 on 
layout. After the fabrication in TSMC, post process such as etching is needed 
to form this microchannel. The three-pillar micro structure is made by Metal1, 
VIA12, Metal2, VIA23, Metal3, VIA34 and Meral4. The measurement 
electrodes are design under the micropillars and made by Metal1 and VIA12. 
 
Fig. 1.3 Layout of IC design about the microchannel IC 
 
1-2-3 PDMS Fabrications 
Post processes are needed for these ICs to avoid liquid from electrodes 
and circuits in IC and to construct the microchannels and microstructures. We 
construct an environment that prevents liquid from the circuits on IC, and 
allows the accurate measurement with PDMS packaging technique [14]. We 
fabricate electrodes on PDMS to connect the PAD on IC to the instruments 
outside. Another microchannel fabricated on PDMS is used to increase the 
height of microchannel in IC and allow the cells passing by.

CHAPTER 2 
CELL CAPTURE VERIFICATION 
  
The microstructure made in this work is developed as the previous 
accomplishment that is designed for HeLa cells. The microchannel in this 
device is 100 μm wide and 25 μm deep to fit the HeLa cells, 10 μm to 18 μm 
in diameter. There is enough room in height for HeLa cells to flow through 
the microchannel. However, the percentage of cell capture rate is influenced 
by the impurities in the liquid. Dust or protein in the liquid will culture 
together to block the three-pillar structure and damage the structure (Fig. 2.1). 
Enhancing the capture rate to shorten the experience time is necessary for this 
work.

2-2 Three Pillar Structures 
In order to enhance the percentage to capture cell as efficient as possible, 
we tried to change the size of microchannel and micropillars to increase the 
amount of cells running into the three-pillar structure. The velocity of liquid 
shown in CFDRC could tell us some information about the percentage of 
cell-capture rate. Figure 2.4(a) is the original MEMS design showed by 
CFDRC simulation. It tells us how the liquid flows in the microchannel.  
Several approaches to raise the percentage of the flow in the center of the 
microchannel as followed.

CHAPTER 4  
FABRICATIONS 
 
4-1 PDMS Mold Design 
 Before we begin PDMS fabrication, PDMS modes are needed. There are 
two kinds of PDMS modes we have to fabricate. One is bottom PDMS, and 
the other is the top PDMS. After the deposition of gold electrode on PDMS, 
the bottom PDMS and top PDMS are bonded together by oxygen plasma.  
 
4-1-1 Bottom PDMS Mold Design 
 The limitation of bottom PDMS is “the same size of IC”. We have to 
design a hole for an IC to put it into the hole exactly. For a microchannel IC, 
the height is 0.49 mm, the width 1194 μm, and the length 2438 μm. PCB 
(printed circuit board) might be achieved this goal by a carving machine 
easily. But, PCB board is breakable and produce small particle on the surface. 
Glass is strong and reliable for PDMS modeling. The process of etching glass 
is well known as HF (hydrofluoric acid) etching, ICP (inductive coupling 
plasma) and RIE. Serious side-etching makes HF etching out of our choice. 
ICP and RIE process is focused on small range etching. The height of 490 μm 
is too huge for ICP and RIE process.  
As the result, we take another solution to fabricate the mode of PDMS. A 
microchannel IC is sacrificed for the mode of PDMS. Mixed glue is used in 
this mode. The sacrificed IC is bonding on the glass by the glue, and there are 
  18

4-1-2 Top PDMS Mold Design 
There are more things to do on top PDMS. We have to create two kinds 
of depth microchannels. We have to make two states of affairs into 
consideration. One is the diameter of the HeLa cell, and the other is the depth 
of microchannel in IC. The diameter of HeLa cell is about 10 to 15 μm. And 
the depth of the microchannel in IC is 6.2 μm. There is not enough room for 
HeLa cell to pass by the microchannel. As the result, we have to build another 
microchannel on the top PDMS. A stair-like design is introduced in this 
microchannel, as shown in Fig. 4.4. The HeLa cell is caught by the 
three-pillar structure if the microchannel is uniform high (Fig. 4.5).

In this work, two steps of electrodes are designed to solve this problem. 
The electrodes on top PDMS are connected with the PAD and the electrodes 
on bottom PDMS. Then the other ends of electrodes on bottom PDMS are 
connected to the external instruments.

 After the deposition of Au and Cr, the structure of electrodes has to be 
developed. The photolithography and wet etching is used to construct this 
structure (Fig. 4.16).

 Figure 4.17 is a the photo mask of the PDMS electrodes and the depict of 
the electrode. This design takes the EMI disturbance into consideration. The 
microchannel IC has the protection layer, Metal3 and Metal4, but there is no 
grounding on the PAD. As the result, this design is a ground electrode with 
grounding between the two electrodes of measurement. In the top PDMS 
photo mask, the ground electrode is also to be the alignment of the 
microchannel in the middle. In the bottom PDMS photo mask, there are two 
“L” alignment to fit the IC hole in the bottom PDMS. To avoid the capacitor 
effect on the alignment of the “L” to the electrodes, the alignment will 
connect to ground after bonding.

be used. Typical MMICs have thicknesses of about 100 μm 
so that the total wire length gets large and produces inductive 
interconnects. Several techniques for building cavities can be 
used, thus allowing chip embedding and reduction of the 
wire length. 
Ribbon-bond Compared to the circular wires used for wire bonding, the 
ribbon bonds provide well defined, wide and flat geometries 
which allow design optimisation with controlled impedance. 
TAB Chip face-up or chip face-down TAB is available today with 
the advantage of providing a one step-die attach process for 
high pin count chips. But typical MMICs have a dozen pins, 
often placed at quite odd locations rendering TAB mounting 
inefficient. The advantage of having ribbon-like connections 
can be achieved with ribbon bonding. 
Collective wiring A very interesting die attach and bonding method for RF 
system integration is the collective wiring as presented in. 
The MMICs are embedded into cavities inside the base 
materials before deposition of the build-up layers.

4-3 PDMS Bonding 
 After the developing of electrodes on top and bottom PDMS, we have to 
bond the two PDMS together. Oxygen plasma is used in to this project [14]. 
800W for 8 seconds under oxygen plasma can bond the two PDMS together.

4-3-2 Wrinkle Electrodes 
 We are able to fabricate different electrode as describe in Chapter 4 
Section 2. Both the flat and wrinkle electrodes are not damage to the bonding 
of oxygen plasma. The status of the flat electrodes is 0.08 μm (Cr is deposited 
by 150Å and Au 650 Å) and wrinkle is 0.2 μm to 3 μm. The height can be 
neglect in the bonding. In order to ensure the connection of electrodes, we 
introduce wrinkle electrodes in this work. Figure 4.20 shows the complete 
package of this work.

5-2 Measurement Instrument 
There are three important experiments we have to do in this project. First 
is the package testing of PDMS. It concludes short circuit electrodes testing, 
electrodes sensitive testing and tensile testing. Second is the capture of 
particles. And the third is the measurement by the completed devices. To 
complete the experiments above, there are three main instruments in our 
experiments.

2. Impedance analyzer: Precision Impedance Analyzers (Kayne Kerr 
Inc., 6440B). 
3. Optical microscope: Nikon 50I

Liquid injection into the microchannel in PDMS and IC is needed in this 
work. The tolerance of pressure in the microchannel decides the speed of 
injection. Figure 5.4 shows how we measure the pressure in microchannel.

CHAPTER 6 
DISCUSSIONS AND RESULTS 
 
 This section includes the verification of how the cell-trapping device 
worked and the solution flowed in microchannel. The following is the PDMS 
bonding testing in surface and microchannel. Finally, the measurement of 
solution in the microchannel of IC is shown in the last.  
 
6-1 Microchannel IC Performance 
In this study, we introduce the CMOS into MEMS design. As the IC is 
packaged in the PDMS, the microchannel on PDMS and IC is aligned and the 
whole stair-like microchannel is completed. After the combination of these 
two microchannels, we tried to catch particles by three pillar structure as the 
MEMS design and filter the debris by the filter in front of the pillars. 
The structures in IC before solution injection are shown in Fig. 6.1(a). 
After the solution injection, the particle is culturing in the filter (Fig. 6.1(b)). 
There are minor quantity particle pass through the filter, and a few particles 
reach the pillars (Fig. 6.1(c)). This situation ensures the function of the filters 
in front of the pillars. They prevent pillars from back-up by the particle or 
dust we do not want it get in the mechanism of three-pillar structure. As the 
particle is fixed in the pillars, the situation proves our design of stair-like 
microchannel and three pillar structure. There are many particles blocked in 
the front of the microchannel (Fig. 6.1(d)). Error RIE process makes this

6-2 PDMS Bonding Tensile Testing  
 As mention on the package, the bonding strength plays an important role. 
The package is the protection and the PAD extension for IC. We divide the 
PDMS bonding into two situations, PDMS breakdown and bonding peeling 
off.  
Table 6.1 shows the situation of PDMS breakdown. Situation number 
means the condition of PDMS breakdown. Number 1 means the failure on 
glue side, number 2 means the break in the edge and number 3 means the 
break in the middle of the PDMS. After data analysis, PDMS will breakdown 
as the pressure directly up to 32.44 gm/mm2, as shown in Fig. 6.3. If the 
pulling strength on to the surface is up to 21.19 gm/mm2, the PDMS will be 
broken easily from the edge, as shown in Fig. 6.4.

6-3 Conclusions  
 In this study, the microchannels of the packaged CMOS MEMS chip are 
completed with PDMS bonding technology. As a technology develops for 
biochips, the dramatic changes are going to occur in biochemical processing. 
Miniaturization through microfabrication processing promises to 
revolutionize biochemistry just as the miniaturization of electronics 
transformed the computer industry. The information produced as a result of 
applying this new technology to genome, proteome, and cell analysis will lead 
to a new, exciting age in genetic medicine. Taiwan has a very famous and 
  50
produced. An IC with microchannel is not easy to alignment. Another way to 
maintain the micropillars and microchannels to capture cells is electrode 
shifting. There is easier fabrication by the method.  
 The electrodes on PDMS has a lot potential on biomedical. PDMS is 
biocompatible and easy to be molded. It can be the substrate of elastic 
electrode to implant to human body. The impedance of our way to fabricate 
Au electrode with 100 µm wide and 9 mm long has only 5 ohm. The low loss 
of this straight line helps the measurement in the human body.
