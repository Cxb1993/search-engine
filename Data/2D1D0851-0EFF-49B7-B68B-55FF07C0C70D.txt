雪崩型檢光二極體工作在線性模式下具有高靈敏度的檢光特性，是長途骨幹
光纖通訊上一非常重要的光電元件；當雪崩型檢光二極體工作在蓋氏模式時則具
有偵測“單光子(single photon)”的能力。雪崩型單光子檢光二極體可提供從可見
光到近紅線波長之廣範應用，包括量子鑰匙分佈(quantum key distribution；
QKD)、量子密碼(quantum cryptography；QC)、時域解析光子計數(time-resolved
photon counting)、量子成象 (quantum imaging)、單分子偵測 (single-molecule
detection)、螢光衰減量測(fluorescence decay measurement)等。傳統用 1300-1550
nm 雪崩型檢光二極體當單光子偵測用，需工作在極低溫下，否則其暗電流(dark
current)及暗點數(dark count)會很大；暗電流及暗點數大時就會降低單光子量子效
率。因此利用較厚的磷化銦塊材(InP bulk)結構或用磷化銦-砷化銦鋁異質結構
(InP-InAlAs Heterostructure) 及砷化銦鋁-砷化銦鎵超晶格結構(InAlAs-InGaAs
Superlattice) 等倍增層(multiplication layer)及採用新製程技術可以更有效提高單
光子量子效率。

2performance in various applications in the 400-900 nm bands. But their performance
is degraded drastically and limits more applications when they operated in the range
1100-1600 nm, due to their low absorption coefficient at these range. For application
of 1550 nm devices with a smaller band-gap than silicon must be utilized, including
germanium and InP-based materials. Because germanium avalanche photodiodes have
more large dark current and noise. It is not suited for high-sensitivity application.
However, InP-based avalanche photodiodes have low dark current, high detection
efficiency and temperature insensitivity characteristics.
InGaAs-InP avalanche photodiodes are usually Separate- Absorption-
Multiplication (SAM)[6] with an InGaAs absorption layer and an InP multiplication
layer. To improve the performance of response speed and gain-bandwidth product,
Separate-Absorption-Graded-Multiplication (SAGM)[7],and Separate- Absorption-
Graded- Charge- Multiplication (SAGCM) have been developed. The electric field
profile in SAM-APD must be precise controlled by using layer structure and device
process [8-12]. Currently, the composition, thickness, and carrier concentration of
epitaxial layer of SAGCM-APD are well controlled by MOCVD. However,
Zn-diffusion is a critical process of APD device because the diffusion depth, diffusion
profile, and hole concentration will be determined by the critical diffusion process.
In this study, we proposed a separate-InGaAs absorption-InGaAsP graded- InP
charge- InP multiplication (SAGCM) structure for fabricated an high performance
single photon APDs. Firstly, we calculate and simulate electrical filed profile in this
device, then design an optimize structure and grown epi-layer by MOCVD. Finally,
we will integrate the spin-on film / RTA (SOF/RTA) diffusion and the well-controlled
device process technique to fabricate InP-based single photon SAGCM-APDs. With
optimal structure and a reliable planar process, we expect these devices having low
dark current, fast response speed, high multiplication factor and low dark count
performance.
4respectively. We expect that the p-n junction depth can be controlled in a range from
0.5 to 5μm, however, the diffusion velocity increases with increasing temperature. So,
in this experiment, we choose different time interval of diffusion under these three
different temperatures. The RTA diffusion conditions for the series of experiments are
illustrated in Table 2.1.1.

2.1.2 Concentration and Profile
The hole concentration profiles were determined by electrochemical
capacitance voltage (EC-V) profiling. By using electrolyte to both etch and form a
Schottky contact with semiconductor, the semiconductor/electrolyte interface
behaves as a Schottky diode and thus permits carrier concentration measurements.
Accent PN4300PC electrochemical C-V profiler was used for hole concentration
measurements, the profiler can determining the electrical carrier concentration as a
function of depth.
The Zn concentration and diffusion profiles were investigated by secondary
ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) with the IMS4F (CAMECA). O2+ primary ion
sources were used and secondary ions were detected to monitor the Zn
concentrations. Calibration was used a p-type InP wafer, zinc doped (4×1018cm-3),
for standard. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy was measured by NTHU instrument
center.
2.2 APD Device Process
Avalanche photodiode are operated at high reverse-bias voltage where avalanche
multiplication takes place. When the incident light is absorbed by absorption layer
and electron-hole pair generated in this region, they will separate in different ways by
electric field. As the photo-generated carriers passed through multiplication region,

2.2.3 Single Photon APD Measurement Set-Up [19-22]
For the characterization of fabricated APDs in terms of single photon
performance, we have conducted the measurement setup shown in Fig. 2.2.10. The
APD device was attached on TE-cooler heatsink under a vacuum of 10-3 Torr and was
connected to two coaxial cables for biasing. The operating temperature can vary
from room temperature to -50℃ by controlling one-stage TE controller. A voltage
pulse is superimposed on the dc bias to yield a sum greater the breakdown voltage.
The light pulse from a DFB laser diode was driven by a voltage pulse generator.
Single photons are obtained by attenuating laser pulse with a variable attenuator.
Photon counter are for counting the avalanche signal on APD output port.

3.1.2 Diffusion Depth and Analysis
The depth of p-n junction was measured by EC-V profiler. Figure 3.1.3 shows
the depth of the p-n junction versus the square root of diffusion time for three
different temperatures. An increase of the depth of the p-n junction with the root of
diffusion time is observed. This well-known behavior is good agreement with
published results using SOF process. The relation between diffusion times to p-n
junction depth conform to djt1/2. A symbol stand for an average value in figure, red
straight line is the result of linear fit. Using the linear fit result, we can calculate the
diffusion coefficient at these three diffusion temperature. The slop of the fit straight
line is the diffusion coefficient (D= xj2/t). The diffusion coefficients obtained in these
three different temperature 535℃、 550℃ and 575℃ are 2.22×10-11cm2/s 、
14.7×10-11cm2/s and 25.8×10-11cm2/s respectively. The result is good agreement with
well-known behavior; the diffusion coefficient is large relatively when diffusion
temperature is higher.

3.2 Single Photon APD performance and measurement [19-22]
In this section, there are some measurements of device and analysis. First we
should check the diffusion depth and diffusion concentration by Electrochemical C-V
(EC-V) profile. Furthermore, we will show the current-voltage (I-V) curves,
multiplication gains, capacitance measurements, frequency responses, and
gain-bandwidth products of devices.
3.2.1 Electrochemical C-V Profile on diffused-APD sample
We know that in planar-type detector, diffusion technique is always used to form
a p-type doping junction. Thus, EC-V measurement is an important method to check
the depth and doping concentration of diffusion junction. By this way, we can also
know the doping concentration and widths of every epitaxial layer. Dilute 100c.c.
EDTA solution is used for etching solution of InP material in EC-V system. Figure
3.2.1 shows the diffusion concentration profile after 50 minutes at the temperature of
530℃ Zn-diffused on APD- sample, which showed the hole concentration of
1.18×1018cm-3.

the breakdown characteristics steeply around breakdown voltage and the breakdown
steeply characteristics of APD was very suitable for single-photon detection.

the generation-recombination (g-r) current in the bulk depletion layer Idg, the g-r
current in the surface depletion region Ids and the diffusion current from the neutral
undepleted region Idn. Their temperature dependences are given in:
, exp( / 2 )g sId Id Eg kT  (2)
and
exp( / )nId Eg kT  (3)
Where Eg is the bandgap energy and k is Boltzmann’sconstant. In order to separate
individual dark current components, the same data were replotted as a function of
inverse temperature at two different bias voltages, as shown in figure 3.2.6. Activation
energy E can be estimated from the data. At high bias, the E is about 0.32eV,
which corresponds to half of the InGaAs energy gap. Therefore, the high-bias dark
current is dominated by the ternary g-r current, from (3). This also means that the
multiplied dark current mainly depends on the InGaAs layers crystal quality, because
the multiplied dark current is mainly characterized by high reverse bias characteristics.
At high bias and high temperature, E comes to 0.62eV, which shows the current is
governed by the ternary diffusion current, from (3). On the other hand, low bias dark
current is governed by the InP cap layer surface g-r current , because E at low bias
is about 0.57eV, as shown in figure 3.2.6, which corresponds to half of InP bandgap.

temperature.

3.2.5 Dark Counts
There area number of mechanisms that generate carriers in a single photon
avalanche photodiode structure, including thermally-generated 、 tunneling-generated
and afterpulsing dark carriers and signal-photon-generated photocarriers. In Geiger
mode operation, these carriers have a finite probability of initialing an avalanche if
they reach the multiplication region. For the characterization of fabricated APDs in
terms of single photon performance, we have completed the measurement setup
shown in Fig. 3.2.8. In first-phase, we focus on the thermally-generated dark
measurement.Then afterpulsing and photon-counting will be characteriz in nex time.
In this study, the preliminary result of dark count of 107/s was obtained. The in depth
dark performances are ongoing investegated and improved.
