Abstract 
In this project, one investigates the 
dynamic behavior of an inclined non-uniform 
cantilever excited close to a sample’s surface in 
fluid. In the typical AFM, a cantilever is set up 
in an inclined angle to a sample’s surface. The 
squeeze-film theory is used to examine the 
viscous damping between the beam and the 
sample’s surface. This model is difficult to 
solve due to non-uniform damping force and 
geometry properties. The closed-form solution 
of this beam model is presented. Furthermore, it 
is found that the effects of the inclined gap and 
the length of beam on the frequency shift and 
the quality factor are significant. For 
minimizing the error of a frequency-modulation 
AFM measuring the bio-material in fluid, a 
longer cantilever is recommended. For a 
non-inclined cantilever with a large gap, the 
effective damping ratio of the 
mass-spring-damper model can be calculated 
accurately by using the conventional formula. 
But for an inclined cantilever, this formula is 
not suitable especially for a short beam with a 
large inclined ratio. 
 
Keywords: AFM, liquid, measuring theory, 
analytical solution 
1. Introduction  
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) subjected 
to a damping force has been widely developed 
as a powerful technique for obtaining 
atomic-scale images and the surface properties 
of the soft materials, such as polymers and 
biological samples [1, 2]. In general, a 
biological sample is measured in liquids. So far, 
some studies have been made on the influence 
of the resonance frequency and quality factor of 
the AFM cantilever in a viscous fluid [3–5]. A 
better understanding of the dynamic behavior of 
AFM is generally required to further improve its 
performance. 
Because the mathematical problem of the 
beam model is hard to solve, the cantilever is 
usually approximated by an effective 
spring-mass-damper model [6-15]. However, 
the accuracy of the discrete model is low. So 
far, few studies are devoted to investigate the 
distributed beam system. Rankl et al. [5] used 
the ‘squeeze-film theory to examine the 
viscous damping when an AFM cantilever 
oscillated. The cantilever was considered to be 
inclined at an angle to a sample’s surface.

coefficients (15) back into Eqs. (13) and (7), the

3.3 Exact Fundamental Solutions 
In general, the closed-form fundamental 
solutions of two coupled differential equations 
with variable coefficients are not available. 
However, if the coefficients of the equations, 
which involve the material properties and/or 
geometric parameters, can be expressed in 
matrix polynomial form, then a power series

For  ,7sW : 7,2 1 / 2,β =  7,0 7,1 7,3 0β β β= = = , 
For  ,8sW : 8,3 1 / 6,β = 8,0 8,1 8,2 0β β β= = = . (19b) 
These eight fundamental solutions satisfy the 
normalization condition (14). Upon substituting 
Eq. (19) into Eqs. (17a) and (18b) and 
collecting the coefficients of like powers of ξ, 
the following recurrence formula can be

generate the eight exact normalized 
fundamental solutions of the differential 
equations (17a) and (18b).  
4 Relation between energy dissipation and 
Q-factor 
The energy dissipation is usually described by 
the Q-factor. Its definition is  
totalEfactor=2
loss
Q
E
π− Δ ,   (21) 
where Etotal is the total energy. lossEΔ  is the 
energy lost per cycle [15]. It is obvious that the 
phase angle is a function of the position variable 
x. It means that when the tip is at the top dead 
position, i.e., the velocity of the tip is zero; the 
velocity at the other position of beam is not zero. 
According to the fact, the total energy is 
considered to be an average value of a cycle as 
follows: 
T
0
1 ( ( ) ( ))
Ttotal s k
E E t E t dt= +∫ , (22) 
where Es and Ek are the strain and kinetic 
energies, respectively. Substituting the solution 
(7) into Eqs. (22), the total energy is expressed 
as 21
