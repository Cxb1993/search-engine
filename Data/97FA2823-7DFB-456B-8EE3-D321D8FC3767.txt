Three-Dimension Interference-Aware Partitioning  
with Area Minimization  
 
 
Abstract—This paper first defines a novel problem that a set of modules are 
assigned to a set of silicon layer to minimize total chip area while satisfying the 
characteristic constraints. Then we present an integer linear programming 
(ILP)-based partitioning to assign a set of modules to the layers of the 
three-dimension architecture during a floorplanning phase. The objective aims to 
minimize the chip area which is the maximum silicon layer area among the set of 
layers in three-dimension system-in-package (SIP) architecture. Moreover, the 
circuit properties that we do not assign the digital and analog modes to the same 
layer are incorporated to increase signal integrity during the partitioning stage. 
The optimal partitioned result for the three-dimension SIP architecture could be 
obtained because all constraints in this study are linear functions. Experimental 
results show that the proposed ILP-based method can minimize the chip area 
while meeting the SIP constraints of circuit properties to reduce the potential 
interference for the wires in the digital and analog intellectual properties. 
Compared to the method without consideration of interference (properties of 
modules and SIP layers), the chip area is with the small additional area. However, 
the proposed ILP-based approach significantly reduces the number of the 
potential interference to be zero, i.e. assign analog and digital modules to the 
different layers of the SIP architecture.

To reduce the chip area of three-dimension floorplanning, 
many partitioning are used to achieve this objective. Some 
researches which are based on the heuristic rules are used to 
efficiently divide a set of modules into a set of partitioned 
subset (corresponding to the multiple layer of three-dimension 
floorplanning). In fact, we observe that the partitioning can be 
formulated as the ILP formulations. It means that we can obtain 
the optimal partitioned results by using the ILP-based approach. 
Furthermore, the number of constraints is fewer and linearly 
increase as the number of modules becomes more and more. 
According to the observations, the ILP formulations are 
efficiently and effectively to obtain the partitioned result and 
minimize the chip area.  
Figure 3 denotes the effectiveness of the ILP-based 
approach to minimize chip area. Figure 3(a) and (b) show the 
five modules with the increasing order of module area and the 
three layers of the three-dimension architecture. Figure 3(c) 
and (d) are the heuristic results which first assigned the small 
modules to each layer. Both of them are not the optimal 
partitioned solution. In fact, we can obtain the optimal solution  
 
and the chip area is 5 (unit area). This observation motives us to 
formulate the ILP-based formulations which are corresponding 
to the given circuits with a set of modules and minimize chip 
area for three-dimension architecture. How to achieve this 
objective is necessary to explore in this work.

B. Problem Definition  
To minimize the chip area, the phase 1 of the methodology 
is to partition the modules which their width and height are 
larger than the user-defined bound. At phase 2, a set of modules 
are assigned to the three-dimension architecture. Hence the 
modules will not be partitioned any more and we obtain a 
partitioned result of each layer. At phase 3, we perform the 
SA-based floorplanner for each layer and get the final 
three-dimension floorplanning.   
According to the above descriptions, we focus on the 
problem of phase 2 and define the problem in this work as 
follows, 
   Given a set of n modules { 1 2 3,  ,  ,  . . . km m m m  } and a set of 
module area { 1 2 3,  ,  ,  . . . ka a a a }, and a set of k silicon layers 
{ 1 2 3,  ,  ,  . . . klyr lyr lyr lyr } for three-dimension architecture. 
Each module is assigned to only one silicon layer and each 
module will not be partitioned. The objective of this paper is to 
minimize the chip area of three-dimension architecture.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 The proposed ILP formulations which were 
automatically generated by C++ language are used to perform 
experiments on an Intel 2.40GB machine with 1GB memory. 
The objective is to optimize the total chip area of 
three-dimension architecture for the given modules and the 
number of floorplanning. To verify the effectiveness of ILP 
formulations, GRSC benchmarks are used to make the 
experiments. Table 1 shows the statistics of GRSC benchmarks. 
We let the number of layers in the three-dimension is four. The 
name of benchmark and number of modules are listed in first 
and second columns. The area of all modules, chip area  of 
partitioned results and the physical area of a floorplanning are 
shown in third, fourth and fifth columns, respectively.  
First, we explore the effectiveness of the ILP formulations. 
The partitioned results are obtained efficiently. Compared to 
the theoretically results (total module area per number of layer), 
the chip area are optimized with small runtime.   
Second, to obtain a feasible floorplan, we develop a 
SA-based floorplanner. For each partitioned results of each 
layer, the floorplanner is used to get a feasible floorplanning. 
Hence, for the three-dimension architecture with k layer, we 
obtain a three-dimension floorplaning by applying k times 
floorplanner.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In the work, the methodology which partitioned to obtain the 
floorplanning with area minimization is presented. We 
formulate the relationship between the modules and the layers 
of three-dimension floorplanning. Then we set a chip area 
bound to minimize the area for each routing layers. 
Furthermore, a well-developed floorplanner is used to obtain a 
floorplan for each layer. Experimental results show that our 
ILP formulations can minimize the chip area with small 
runtime.

Abstract—This paper presents a integer linear programming-based 
approach which assigns the given modules to a set of layers for the 
three-dimensional floorplanner. The objective is to minimize the chip 
area which is the maximum layer area among the set of three- 
dimensional integrated circuits. We first formulate the module 
assignment which automatically determines the given modules to a set 
of three-dimensional layers. It means that a set of partitioned results 
are constructed for a three-dimensional floorplanner. Furthermore, a 
simulated-annealing-(SA for short)based floorplanner which applied 
the sequence-pair to perturb the relationships of modules is used to 
obtain the floorplan for each layer in three-dimensional architecture. 
Experimental results show that the maximum chip area can be 
minimized by the integer linear programming-based approach. One 
well-developed floorplanner can obtain a feasible floorplan with the 
minimization area for three-dimensional architecture. 
 
Keywords—Floorplan, partitioning, integer linear programming, 
area minimization. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
here many benefits to apply three-dimensional architecture 
to implement the modern chip design. Total wire-length, 
chip area, number of via count and performance are 
significantly improved by utilizing the novel three-dimensional 
floorplanning. Compared to the traditional two-dimensional 
floorplanning, the partitioning phase is necessary to minimize 
chip area for the novel three-dimensional floorplanner.  
Many researches focus on the integer linear 
programming-based (ILP-based) approach to optimize the area, 
wire length, power consumption or clock period. Lin et al. 
proposed the ILP-based approach to minimize total wiring area 
for design automation of analog circuits [1]. Nguyen et al. 
presented the ILP-based methods to simultaneously optimized 
power and delay for VLSI designs [2]. Chien et al. provides 
ILP-based approach to minimize power consumption under 
timing, power and area constraints [3]. Chai et al. presented 
ILP formulations and solved different problems to minimize 
peak current and leakage, respectively [4]. Huang et al. reduced 
the clock period for sequential circuit at the high level synthesis 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by using the ILP-based way [5]. Most researches did not focus 
on the area minimization by using the ILP-based methods. 
The three-dimensional (3D for short) floorplanning are 
widely explored as the gate counts and circuit complexities are 
growing rapidly in the recent year [6]. Some researches 
explored the representation for three-dimensional 
floorplanning with the dedicated objectives such as the area 
minimization [7]. Hung et al. presented the floorplanner to 
minimize the thermal issue and estimated the length by the 
half-perimeter approach [8]. Tsai et al. studied the thermal 
issue for the three-dimensional floorplanning with 
consideration of the physical position and area of 
through-silicon-via (TSV for short) [9]. Xiao et al. gave the 
fixed-outline constraint for the three-dimensional 
floorplanning and improved the thermal issue by the inserting 
TSV [10]. Some of them did not minimize the objective by 
integrating the ILP-based approach. 
The main contributions of this paper are as follow. First, we 
define the problem of area minimization for the 3D architecture. 
Second, the module assignment problem which determines the 
set of modules to a set of layers of the 3D architecture is solved 
by using the integer linear programming-based approach. 
Finally, all constraints are linear functions and the number of 
variables is reduced to speed up the runtime. 
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II 
describes motivations and problem definition. Section III 
discusses the methodology to minimize the chip area for the 3D 
floorplanner, respectively. Experimental result and conclusions 
are attached in Sections IV and V, respectively. 
II. PRELIMINARY 
In this subsection, we first discuss the motivation for 
exploring the ILP-based approach and then define the problem 
that we solve in this work.  
A. Motivation  
Area minimization is the important issue at the modern 
floorplanner. For each layer, the area which is allocated by the 
assigned modules is the product of the maximum width and 
height. Hence, the layer area for layer i is defined as follows, 
 
i i iLA w h= ×
                                                         (1) 
 
where iw
  and ih

denote the maximum x-coordinate and 
maximum y-coordinate for layer i , respectively. Figure 1 
denotes the layer area which is allocated by the modules.

III. OUR ILP-BASED METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we discuss the ILP formulations for phase 2 
because the pre-processing to divide the extra large modules is 
easy. Besides, the floorplanners are well-developed in the 
literature. Therefore, we only discuss the ILP formulations in 
detailed. 
A. Area Minimization Formulation 
A binary variable ( , )x i j  is set to one, if a module i  is 
assigned to layer j , otherwise ( , )x i j  is set to zero. The 
objective involved in this paper is described as follows, 
min    _total area                                                 (3)

where ( , )x i j denotes the module i  is assigned to 
layer j . ( )area i and n denote the area of the module i  and the 
number of layers in three-dimensional chip, respectively. The 
_total area is the maximum chip area for the 
three-dimensional chip with n layers. Formula (3) lists the 
objective to minimize the total chip area for the 
three-dimensional chip with n layers. Formula (4) shows that 
the each module i can be assigned to only one layer j . 
Formula (5) means that the maximum chip area is larger than 
the total area of each layer j . Of course, we can use four 
variables to represent the total area of each layer j . To speedup 
the computational runtime, the four variables are reduced to 
only one maximum chip area.  
B. An Example 
In the following, we apply an example in Figure 4 to explain 
the meanings of our ILP formulas. For the 3D architecture 
design with four layers and there are 11 modules should be 
assigned. Hence, we have 11n= and 4k = . The objective is 
to minimize the maximum chip area and the description is as 
follows, 
         min   _ ;total area=                                                 (6)  
For the objective function, we have the following constraints 
to minimize the total area. The following is the area information 
of each module.  
       
(1) 1;  (2) 2;  (3) 3;
(4) 4;  (5) 5;  (6) 6;  
(7) 7;  (8) 8;  (9) 9;  
(10) 10;  (11) 25.

                 (7) 
 
We do not partition a module and each module is only 
assigned to each layer. For module 1, there are four possibilities 
to place it for a three-dimensional architecture. Hence we have  
      (1,1) (1, 2) (1,3) (1, 4) 1;x x x x+ + + =                        (8) 
Similarly, we have two formulas for module 2 and module 
11, respectively. 
 
       (2,1) (2, 2) (2,3) (2, 4) 1,x x x x+ + + =                       (9) 
and 
 
       (11,1) (11, 2) (11,3) (11, 4) 1.x x x x+ + + =                 (10) 
We assume that binary variables (1,1)x , (2,1)x , . . ., (11,1)x  
to denote if one module is assigned to one layer. For each layer 
1, total chip area is the sum of the products of module area of 
modules 1 to 11 and the binary variables (1,1)x , 
(2,1)x , . . ., (11,1)x . We want to minimize chip area of layer 1 
and we have the following constraint, 
 
total_area (1) (1,1) (2) (2,1) (3) (3,1)
                   (4) (4,1) (5) (5,1) (6) (6,1)
                   (7) (7,1) (8) (8,1) (9) (9,1)

   (10) (10,1) (11) (11,1);area x area x× + ×
(11) 
 
Similarly, for layers 2, 3 and 4, we can formulate the total 
area according to the above discussions. 
To minimize total area for three-dimensional architecture, 
we have the following results: modules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are 
assigned to layer 1; modules 7 and 8 are assigned to layer 2; 
modules 9 and 10 are assigned to layer 3; and module 11 is 
assigned to layer 4. In fact, the total modules area is 80 and the 
chip area of each layer is equal to 20 if some modules can be 
partitioned into a set of sub-modules. In this work, the module 
can not be partitioned and the module assigned is correct after 
we check the results of binary variables. We have the following 
module assignment as following, 
(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) 1;x x x x x x= = = = = =        
(7, 2) (8, 2) 1;x x= =                                                    (12) 
(9,3) (10,3) 1;x x= =                                                          
and  
(11,4) 1.x =                                                                 (13) 
Finally, we get the optimal solution which is equal to 25 area 
units ( _ 25total area= ). Figure 4 denotes the ILP-based result 
for this circuit.

(英文) In this project, we first define a novel problem that a set of modules are assigned to a set 
of silicon layer to minimize total chip area while satisfying the characteristic constraints. 
Then we present an integer linear programming (ILP)-based partitioning to assign a set of 
modules to the layers of the three-dimension architecture at a floorplanning phase. The 
objective aims to minimize the chip area which is the maximum silicon layer area among 
the set of layers in system-in-package (SIP) architecture. The optimal partitioned result 
for the three-dimension SIP architecture could be obtained because all constraints in this 
study are linear functions. In other words, the ILP-based method minimizes the chip area 
while meeting SIP constraints s to reduce the potential interference for the wires in the 
digital and analog intellectual properties.
