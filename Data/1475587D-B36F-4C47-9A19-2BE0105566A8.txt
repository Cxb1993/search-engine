algorithms that rely on an awareness of network 
conditions in order to maximally utilize available 
spectrum and avoid spatial bias, such that sensing 
and transmitting spectrum sections are balanced. We 
focus on spectrum sections allocation issues for our 
proposed group-based strategic and complete one 
conference paper and two journal-format papers, which 
are under reviewed. This project has addressed the 
fair pre-allocation problem among spectrum section 
for sensing to achieve, for each packet, end-to-
current node delay differential fairness； we had 
built on the successes of fair allocation of 
available spectral bands and extend the work to a 
consideration of different levels of services with 
varied priority weights； and then we had extended 
the previous research issues to design related 
admission control mechanisms such that the QoS of 
different classical flows are ensured as well as to 
maximize system performance with our proposed 
admission strategies for scant available spectrum 
bands. These proposed algorithms had been evaluated 
and compared with the existing methods. Accordingly, 
we had understood the major features of the research 
issues and proposed the algorithms to improve the 
performance.

本研究採用的策略是在感測前配置與干擾範圍內之其他傳輸互斥的頻段，所得到的可用頻帶也因
此與其它連結之可用頻帶沒有交集，其感測-傳輸週期如圖2所示。於干擾範圍內，以連結作為頻段配
置單位以最大化可用頻帶交集且提升傳輸效能。依此所感測到的頻帶即為該連結或該群組中心連結
(central link)之可用頻帶，這降低了頻帶選擇與協調的延遲。就所探討的相關文獻中，目前尚未有針對
感測前頻段配置來避免干擾與可用頻帶交集的問題[4][14]。因此，這些議題將在進行深入分析與證明。 
  
圖1 感測後之可用頻帶配置循環 圖2 感測前之頻段配置循環 
圖3 一般頻譜感測問題 圖4 隨機頻段感測問題 
 
圖5 頻帶、頻段、以及通道之畫分方式 
 
這個機制的感測頻段範圍、頻段量、干擾、多重天線、協調、以及允入控制等概念說明如下： 
 感測頻段範圍：雖然每一裝置可以感測較寬的頻譜[4][15]，依傳輸的特性分析，共用的範圍最小
為節點對節點的傳輸上，必須配置相同的頻段，於干擾範圍內之閒置CR將依涵蓋之範圍配置不同
頻段以進行協同感測(cooperative sensing)，來增加此連結之可用頻帶量。 
 多重天線與傳輸範圍：對於平行傳輸、空間再利用、以及避免干擾而採用多重天線(multi-radio)的
機制將有助於提升可用頻帶量。亦即PU與SU在不同的地理空間中使用相同的頻帶，不會互相干
擾。控制傳輸功率大小以提升傳輸空間再利用，可降低干擾且提升傳輸容量(capacity)，當CR在不
同的頻帶間感測與切換(switching)時，兩點之間的距離將影響可用頻帶交集，亦即當兩點距離短
時，可用頻帶之交集較多，反之則反；可用時間也必須是PUs所用頻帶閒置時間的交集，這使得可
用頻帶的時間相對來得少。此外，CR所能感測與傳輸距離也有最大範圍之限制[10-12]。 
 感測頻段量：CR配置的頻段量將影響每一連結的可用頻帶量，當有多個節點協同感測涵蓋干擾範
圍時，1)可蒐集更多可用頻帶；2)感測到的可用頻帶將更可靠。然而，頻譜空間偏差(spectrum spatial 
 3
提供SUs更多可用頻帶的存取機會(opportunity)[3-5][20]，亦有文獻提出協同運作的方法[4][15][21-22]
以最大化可用頻帶量，然而，這些機制未提及以群組為基礎之感測頻段配置。 
  為了解決干擾的問題，有些研究以叢集(cluster)為劃分單位使用不同的通道來傳輸[21][23]。在多重
叢集(multi-cluster)架構下，動態通道配置已證明為一難解的填圖(graph coloring)問題，其目標也是提升
系統效能，可惜並沒有考慮到感測前之共用與互斥頻段配置的概念，如此在叢集內成員所感測到的節
點到節點之可用頻帶依然存在隨機配置的缺點：有許多不重疊的頻帶卻與其他相鄰節點重疊。 
  有些研究是針對單一感測天線(CR)下進行相鄰節點之頻帶差異策略，透過通道指派(channel 
assignment)予傳統以區段為基礎(segment-based)的多重通道網路來改善網路效能，於[24]中，主要是延
伸傳統多重通道配置問題中將傳輸路徑依所處PU的通道構成一個區段(segment)，再使用相同的通道來
傳輸。這與我們所要進行的感測前頻段配置不同分別描述於表1所示：

通道
(Single-radio 
multi-channel) 
[10][16-19] 
以節點為基礎
指派
(node-based 
assignment) 
節點指派意指將通道配置於節點上，這樣的結果將使得傳送者需要與
接收者協調至相同的通道上才可以傳輸。這種方法主要的考量是節省
成本，當同時有兩個流量(flows)流經某一節點時，則其中一個流量必
須等待，造成通道切換延遲的問題。 
以連結為基礎
指派
(link-based 
assignment) 
當通道指派在連結上時，於傳輸流量中不同的連結可以在任何用通道
上運作。所以，可以在相同流量上指派不同的通道。然而，每一個節
點只有單一天線而無法顧及所有相鄰的傳輸，導致通道切換延遲與終
端機隱藏(hidden terminal)的問題，亦即當某一連結傳送時，另一連結
雖然有指派頻道，但仍必須等待而導致傳輸延遲。 
以流量為基礎
指派
(flow-based 
assignment) 
當通道指派到流量時，不同的流量運作於不同的通道上，但某一流量
上的連結則運作於相同通道上，由於延遲或終端機隱藏(hidden 
terminal)問題仍將發生[25]，且造成更多交叉點。正如路經交叉路口
時需要等待紅綠燈，而在傳輸節點則必須額外加入頻道切換問題；此
外，每一流量內的連結之間也無法平行傳輸，否則將彼此干擾。 
以區段為基礎
指派
(segment-based 
assignment)[24
] 
在此所指的區段(segment)為指網路區段。以CRN的角度來看，與PUs
所傳送的範圍作為互斥通道指派方式，於是將路徑切割為一段段的方
式來指派通道，並且在這一段路徑內避免通道切換延遲(channel 
switching delay)。然而，1)每一個節點都使用單一天線，必須在同一
區段內以共同通道來運作；2)在同路徑上的每一區段之間，將需要擁
有兩段共同通道來傳送訊息，進而需要在這個節點上進行通道切換；
3)同一區域內使用相同頻道將需要以競爭方式進行；4)於不同流量所
流經相同節點時，則必須以競爭方式或是排程來決定交叉點之傳輸，
於是造成傳輸延遲。

當有多重天線時，將通道指派到節點上時，將由各節點來管理。然而，
每一節點仍需與相鄰節點協調可用的頻帶，此協調機制需要配置每一
節點之天線不同的頻帶。

來達到這個目標，以配合不同的服務層級之傳輸，議題包括： 
· 傳輸延遲差異(delay differential) (加權)平衡：延遲差異的定義是經過每一節點延遲與最大允許延遲
之差值來判斷那些封包已過度延遲了[31]，正因為感測與路由將導致不同的傳輸延遲，有些封包將
流經負載較重的網路使得錯誤率與中斷率增加，導致較大的傳輸延遲。所以，如何透過此值來配
置非交集之多重頻段與天線以達到區域與流量之負載平衡為本議題所要進行的方向。 
· 目前至目的地節點(current-to-destination node)之路徑長度：剩餘路徑長度將影響流量(flow)的服務
品質，路徑越長可能造成更大的延遲，因此需要配置更多的頻譜資源。此外，考量每一連結之傳
輸速率(即：容量)將隨時間與節點而不同，在多重傳速之下將導致暴量(burst)，致使傳輸延遲變異
(delay variance)過大的問題。依此特性將以動態配置感測頻段以符合傳輸延遲差異之(加權)公平性。 
· 剩餘路徑之網路狀況回饋：所謂的剩餘路徑狀況為路徑上每一CR對於所感測到的頻段利用率、錯
誤率、以及中斷率等之加權平均值，由於來源至目前節點之路徑的延遲差異較大時，可由目前至
目的地節點之間來控制，使其獲得較多的資源以平衡傳輸延遲差異；相對地，剩餘路徑的網路狀
況較差時，則必須在前半段路徑來事先改善，以使端點至端點之傳輸延遲達到(加權)公平。 
· 緩衝器大小：由於優先權較大的需要優先傳送，因此將更容易造成網路中的狀況好時，即大量傳
送封包至下一個節點，以預防後半段路徑所造成的擁塞，本研究將考量緩衝器大小的影響，並且
進行效能評估。 
  當通道與路由同時考量時，He等作者提出負載平衡最短路徑樹(LB-SPT)與以負載為基礎的通道指
派(LCA, load-based channel assignment)演算法指派通道於連結上[32]，與本議題不同之處在於頻段之配
置是依CRN在每一時槽於干擾範圍內之依延遲差異來判斷配置量，以使下一個時槽之延遲差異趨於一
致，由於這些頻帶是區域性的，所以可用頻帶將隨不同跳躍而有所不同，甚至下一個節點能否再往下
一個跳耀與可用頻帶量相關，要確保相關路由連結的頻帶互斥存取將是一項挑戰。 
    當考量延遲與產出平衡時，新的路由衡量基準WCETT(weighted cumulative expected transmission 
time)運用於MR-LQSR(multi-radio link-quality source routing)[26]的路由協定，透過通道差異的概念與最
少跳躍來平衡延遲與產出。在此，路由衡量標準以節點到節點延遲作為每一頻帶之干擾公式於每一配
置之頻帶以滿足傳輸延遲公平性。 
  當頻帶配置予不同的節點，許多研究主要針對遊戲理論(game theorem)來配置[29-30]，透過區域買
賣的概念來達到分散式配置頻帶，這個方法對使用者而言是公平的，但是對於節點的傳輸延遲則是不
公平的。於[33]中採用分散式來配置頻帶，雖然需要交換的資訊明顯降低，但只能達到次佳化之結果。 
  關於加權平衡的研究歷來已久，以網路協定、佇列(queuing)、網路運作均有探討優先權的概念。
於無線網路協定方面，有針對以基地台為基礎(BS-oriented)的傳輸運用MAC(media access control)協定
來控制不同服務類別[34-35]，也運用於CRN以媒體存取控制來執行SUs之資源配置優先權[36]，依每一
SU對於感測頻段之貢獻以及所需要傳送封包的時效性來決定那些SU透過設定較短的競爭窗格(CW, 
contention windows)來獲取較高的優先權，進而可以獲取較多的可用頻帶使用的機會。而本研究除了探
討感測前之加權頻段配置之外，主要是延續前述議題來考量每一流量之傳輸權重、剩餘路徑長度、以
及剩餘路徑網路狀況，以達到傳輸延遲差異平衡、最大化效能、以及最小封包丟棄率等。 
  而Liu等作者[36]也運用與Wang等作者[37-38]相同的概念來管理感測頻帶，透過統計的方式來記錄
那些頻段的狀況，例如：頻段利用率、中斷率、以及錯誤率等來衡量此頻段的好壞，作為感測時之優
先選擇，以提升頻帶存取機率來改善系統效能，本研究的核心並非著重在這個方面。所以，將不針對
這方面進行分析比較。不過，我們將運用這種概念於所要配置的頻段集。 
    有些學者則針對以PUs和SUs之間以優先權佇列的方式來存取[39]，依PUs使用頻帶本來就具有優先
使用權，即原來的機制是控制在頻道的使用上，而Zhang等作者則是將這個概念轉化為封包不同權重之

資訊將延用上一計畫之研究結果[11-12]，以將重心放在資源管理與允入控制方面，目的是設計相關管
理策略於多重天線之多重跳耀路由(multi-hop routing)問題上，依傳輸路徑之每一連結決定每一CR之功
率強度與範圍，且搭配感測前的頻段配置，依干擾範圍內所得可用頻帶多寡進行允入控制，以區域控
制來達到端點至端點之服務品質，以區域決策來考量存-轉送(store-and-forward)的端點至端點傳輸特
性，以探討如何以SU的角色有效地發揮既有閒置的資源。 
 
四、研究方法 
 
A. 網路模式(Network Model) 
  依研究背景所述，本計畫將以多重流量於多重跳耀來探討相關議題，此網路是由多重天線連結相
鄰CRs，並將此CRN模式化成一個圖G(V,L)(如圖6所示)，其中節點集合V表示某一區域中之相關裝置，
此集合包含兩個子集合VPU與VSU分別表示PUs與SUs，每一個節點之每一個CR各自擁有所屬的佇列，而
每一個link在時間τ擁有一平均容量cτ(u,v)(units/sec)，每一節點v∈VPU都有其既有傳輸範圍與通道
(channel)，將依最大的傳輸範圍來決定此連結是否存在於集合L，link (u,v)表示節點u所具有訊號強度可
以傳送到節點v，再實際所需的訊號強度調整。 
 
 
圖6 CRN的網路架構(其中SS表示為頻段spectrum section之縮寫) 
 
針對圖6所包含以基地台為基礎(如：節點BSg)或是隨意網路(如：節點j, k, l)的每一CR都包含暫存的
功能，每一封包包含兩個時間標記：其一為連結估計時間；其二是由來源至目前節點之傳輸延遲差異。
為了在短時間內選取高可用之頻帶，每一節點上的CR都備有且依群組之頻段來調整與維護一份感測頻
段集(spectrum section pool)，這些清單將用作為下一個時槽感測之用，依此下圖陰影部分為既有無線網
路於不同時槽沒有使用的頻譜空洞，為了簡化這個架構圖，對於PU之架構圖將不顯示在上面，只以陰
影表示該區域為PU傳輸干擾範圍，例如：SS1為WiMAX傳輸時所用之頻段，於時槽t1沒有使用，而形
成一個頻譜空洞，此時SU將此空洞視為可用頻帶且在範圍與時間內傳輸。 
本研究考量既有與感測網路之頻帶是可覆蓋的(overlay)，可用頻帶受限於既有網路的傳輸範圍與使

 在這個研究議題中，以最大容許之傳輸延遲來計算每一節點所允許之傳輸延遲，再於每一傳輸節
點來計算已傳輸延遲和每一節點之允許傳輸延遲差作為分配可協同感測天線的數量，越多２ 測
天線數量表示可感測的頻段數越多，依此來平衡每一次感測和傳輸週期，於多重傳速之封包中，
當封包傳送至中間節點時，若加權之封包傳輸延遲偏差越大，則事先配置越多的可感測協同感測
的天線數，反之則反，依此由局部的節點資源配置來達到端點對端點延遲(end‐to‐end delay)之公
平性。此期刊論文仍在審查中。

End-to-end Delay Fairness in CRNs”, (under review) (請參考本報告之附件 1) 
 為了提升節點對節點傳輸所需之可用頻帶交集最大化，提出以群組協同感測來獲得較多的可用頻
帶資源，進而達到傳輸延遲最小化。在此我們將延用上一計劃所得之路由協定與衡量基準，由來
源節點至目的地節點之端點至端點延遲以滿足連結、路徑、可用頻帶、容量、傳輸錯誤率、中斷
率、以及傳輸範圍限制下，以平均端點至端點延遲變異來比較所提方法之優劣。此期刊論文仍在
審查中。

Cognitive Radio Networks,” (under review) (請參考本報告之附件 2) 
 這個議題延續前二個議題網路架構與議題，考量當資源不足時，如何透過允入控制來達到所需的
服務品質，除了考量 PU 存取所佔用的頻帶、中斷、以及干擾外，SU 之間於傳輸流量時所發生的
連結錯誤、可用頻帶、傳輸延遲差異等將列為這個機制運作所需考量的因素。此研究仍在整理中。 
 
討論（含結論與建議） 
     
本計畫中，我們分別完成了以群組為基礎之感測前的頻段配置、以群組為基礎之公平與加權感測
前頻段配置、以及允入控制議題之分散式演算法設計，由於所設計的模式是以封包為單位，且依干擾、
感測、以及溝通協調的範圍提出傳輸延遲偏差的概念，作為分散式演算法的設計，並且設計了多項評
估方法，且與現有相關文獻所提的方法來比較，當我們考量的影響變數越多，則反應在傳輸的效能就
越好，本研究籍由分析感知天線的特性來設計資源配置比率，同時也比較現有文獻之優缺，依此設計
了一系列的實驗設計，依此所設計的分散式演算法也優於現有的資源配置方法。 
在這階段中，已嚐試投至期刊中審查，唯仍有一些需要修正的地方，已修正完成並且投出審查中。
於下一個階段中，我們將繼續延伸現有的研究議題於(i)節能(energy efficiency)方面，於考量省電之下，
如何慎選感測的頻段、如何配置協同感測的天線、以及感測時間之控制上；(ii)感測與協調訊息傳送之
成本(overhead)，運用分散式和群組概念一來避免彼此干擾，二來降低訊息交換量，依此來改善現有設
計的分散式演算法。此外，也將繼續使用拉格蘭日法來衡量解題結果之優劣。

計畫成果自評 
   
  本計畫之執行依原計畫內容進行，完成相關分散式演算法和傳輸延遲(delay)之評估比較，並且將
研究成果撰寫成論文發表，唯審查結果需要再修正，為了提升論文的發表品質也將繼續在論文上的改
善，因為審查需要一段時間，修正後的結果仍在審查中。因此，目前只有一篇國際研討會論文和參加
全國電信研討會成果，值得一提的是，也透過這次機會擔任了研討會二場發表的主持人，希望後得仍
有更多機會於發表時，也累積主持會議的經驗。 
  對於這次的計畫因資源有限，並且是針對未來科技的研究，許多設備仍在發展中，因此，實際結
合現有產品來發展仍面臨許多挑戰，但在探討相關議題時，已將相關可能發生的狀況盡量予以考量，
確實要能通盤考量實有其困難，所以，僅就原規劃的範疇予以探討。至少在觀念的建立與現有無線網
路的運作原理和限制都有所深入研究。會針對這一點來自評這次的計畫乃因未來的發展方向將著重於
實務應用與整合，以期往後研究方向也朝向實務研究來發展。 
  本計畫於執行的過程中，有許多位研究生與大學生共同討論，雖然無線網路對於資管學生的能力
不及於資工或通訊系所，但對也建立了基本的無線網路概念，這對於培育學生具有管理網路是有幫助
的，雖然不斷指正他們正確的觀念且給予壓力，但對於他們也是一種訓練。依此本計畫已依原先規劃
的加以實現，對學生於撰寫碩士論文的訓練；老師的課程教材來源；於生活環境中熟悉無線網路、感
知天線網路、以及資源配置管理都有所深入研究都符合計畫目標。

spectral bands that are sensed available both for the sender and
receiver. The proposed cycle negotiates the same set of spectral
bands (i.e., αuv = 1.0) before sensing. The availability of a
spectral band is affected by the sensed available rate ofMu and
jointly sensed available rate of M(u,v). If the rate αuv is less
than 0.33, the available spectral bands matching rate is also
less than 0.33. Fig. 1 shows an example of node g negotiating
with node j to cooperatively sense the set of spectral bands
{5, 6, 7} (i.e., αgj = 1.0). The available band matching rate
with the proposed cycle is not less than a general cycle (i.e.,
at least the extra common spectral bands {6, 7} are sensed).
Suppose the cooperative sensing area must be part of the
transmission area because 1) the available bands are out of
range and may be unavailable for an active link and 2) a
disjointed set of spectral allocations within an interference
range does not interfere with the neighboring active links.
Denote J(u,v) as the set of cooperative CR to cover the
transmission range of link (u, v). Namely, the set of J(u,v)
includes the required CR to ensure that a spectral band used by
link (u, v) does not interfere with PUs. Fig. 3 shows the union
area of A1 and A2 of nodes {u, c} to cover the transmission
area of link (u, v). However, the nodes d and e are not the
candidate cooperative CR, because the sensing areas do not
cover the transmission area.
Suppose the negotiation area is within the interference
range. However, a negotiation differential problem occurs
because the negotiation areas are different, as a result that
the proportions of resource for allocating are different. Fig. 3
shows an example of a part of area A1 being covered by the
signal range of link (u, v), but not covered by link (v, c). The
metric and cooperative CR in area A1 differ from those in A2.
Consequently, the allocation base of the candidate cooperative
CR for sensing is different between links (u, v) and (v, c),
but link (u, v) must consider the allocation metric of link
(v, c). Thus, this study adopts an approach to approximate
the proportion of resource allocation to the respective link.
Because the resource is pre-allocated within the interference
range, we must consider 1) that the duration of a flow has been
transmitted; 2) that the duration of a flow remains to be sent;
and 3) that the maximal tolerated end-to-end delay from the
viewpoint of the local area achieves load balancing. This work
proposes a delay bias metric, tbiasρ , which is calculated as the
differential between the transmitted delay tρ and the tolerated
delay κr × (hd(u,v) + 1) of the number of transmitted hops
hd(u,v) from source node d to link (u, v), where κr is a per-hop
tolerable delay (i.e., D/nr, which is the maximal end-to-end
tolerated delay D divided by the number of hop nodes nr
of the flow r). A larger delay bias implies a longer sending
delay. If the delay bias is larger than 0, then the packet is
out of the tolerable delay. A longer path results in a smaller
per-hop tolerable delay so that it has a higher probability to
be out of a tolerable delay if the allocated resources are less
than a shorter path, as stated in Lemma 1.
Lemma 1: Longer paths are more sensitive to change in the
per-hop tolerable delay, because the tolerable delay D/n1 is
less than D/n2 if the number of hops n1 > n2.
Proof: Suppose there are two paths p1 and p2 that have
n1 and n2 hops (where n1 > n2), respectively. The maximal
tolerable delay κ1 × (hd(u,v) + 1) at the hd(u,v) hop for p1
is smaller than p2, because the per-hop tolerable delay κ1 =
D/n1 < κ2 = D/n2. When the packet is sent to the hd(u,v)
hop on p1, the delay bias tbiasρ = tρ − κ1 × (hd(u,v) + 1) is
larger than that which is transmitted to the hd(u,v) hop on p2
with the same amount of resources. Thus, the longer path has
a less tolerable delay (i.e., tbiasρ on p1 > t
bias
ρ on p2) to satisfy
the maximum end-to-end tolerable delay.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The pre-allocation resource problem is detailed as follows:
Given:
· The set of CR eu is on node u.
· The set of CR I(u,v) is within the interference range of link
(u, v).
· The set of cooperative CR J(u,v) covers the transmission
range of link (u, v).
· The set of spectra S(u,v) is pre-allocated for link (u, v).
· Multiple transmission flows R.
· The set of links Lr is used for flow r ∈ R.
· The set of packets Pr is transmitted on flow r ∈ R.
· The interruption rate θ(u,v) is on link (u, v).
· The number of spectral bands σi is what a CR i can
cooperatively sense.
Objective: to minimize the maximal transmitted delay bias
within the interference range for each time slot.
Subject to:
· The allocated set of cooperative CR for sensing.
· The disjointed set of spectral bands being assigned to
cooperative CR for sensing.
· Transmission and queuing delay constraints: Each packet
is scheduled based on the delay bias on each outgoing link
buffer. The delay bias of a packet and queuing length are
marked with decision variables φρu and q(u,v).
· Source to current nodes tolerating delay bias.
To determine:
· Cooperative CR assignment χi(u,v): the variable being equal
to 1 indicates that CR i cooperatively senses for link (u, v),
otherwise 0.
· Spectral band assignment asi: whether a spectral band s ∈
S(u,v) is assigned to CR i for cooperative sensing.
· Bandwidth c(u,v): the bandwidth that is calculated by the
sensed available bands on link (u, v).

Fig. 5. Effect of the traffic load on average end-to-end delay bias.
The main idea of the proposed heuristic, the pre-allocated
spectral bands with delay bias (PSDB) algorithm is that the
tolerable delay is set as an adjusting rate for local resource
allocation. A packet being out of tolerable delay per-hop
allocates more resources to modulate a higher bandwidth.
Thus, the packet is not dropped when the delay of a packet is
overdue on an intermediate node because the overall delay may
still be fulfilled in the following hops. The time complexity
is O(z|I(u,v)||S(u,v)|), where z is the constant number of
negotiations between the active link and cooperative CR.
Step 1: Initially, find the shortest path [3] and determine
the set of cooperative CR J(u,v), tolerated delay, and
interference range for each active link (u, v).
Step 2: Negotiation period - Each active link collects the
allocation data within the interference range and calcu-
lates the proportion x(u,v) using the proposed schemes
(i.e., WDB and WDBI) and existing schemes (i.e., AE
and QS). The transmitting nodes announce the number of
spectral bands for cooperative CR smaller than x(u,v).
Step 3: Sensing period - Each cooperative CR reports the
available bands to its active link (u, v).
Step 4: Switching period - A transceiver switches to the
available bands M(u,v) sensed by the cooperative CR.
Step 5: Transmitting period - The packet is sent to the next
hop based on the modulated available bandwidth with (9).
Step 6: Record the delay bias of each packet with (11), and
repeat Steps 2-5 for different active links for each time
slot τ ∈ T .
Step 7: Compute the average end-to-end delay bias.
IV. EVALUATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The general evaluation setup and parameters are shown in
[2] for all simulations. The extra settings are: 1) the finite
buffer size is 1000 units; and 2) the number of spectral
bands for allocating is unlimited. The following cases cause

delay bias.
different end-to-end delay biases. Fig. 4 shows the effect
on the number of SUs when more SUs result in additional
cooperative sensing CR. Negotiation overhead is reduced by a
pre-allocated disjointed set of spectra. Thus, the average end-
to-end delay bias decreases when the number of SUs increases.
Fig. 5 shows the effect on the amount of traffic load. The
delay bias increases in conjunction with the amount of traffic
load. However, the increasing ratio is less when the traffic
load is larger because a limited capacity results in limited
management of the amount of traffic.
Fig. 6 shows the effect of maximal transmission range and
interference. This differs from Fig. 4, in which the number
of SUs increased only within the fixed area. When the range
is extended, additional cooperative CR are included to obtain
additional available bands. However, a longer range results in
a lower quality of sensed bands with more interruptions and
retransmissions as a result of increasing the delay bias.
Overall, the allocation scheme includes more features of
a CRN and obtains higher performance; hence, the proposed
WDB and WDBI schemes outperform other existing schemes
AE and QS, even when the traffic load is high. This is because
additional available bands are allocated to higher instances of
delay bias and the rates of interruption. Because cooperative
CR and spectral bands are pre-allocated, the trend is changed
unceasingly because of the sensing availability rate.

2utilize licensed/unlicensed spectral bands [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], giving it opportune access
to many parts of the spectrum. However, underlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs), which are
networks of secondary users (SUs), do not allow transceivers to interfere with primary user (PU)
transmissions. Once SUs overhear the sender or receiver of the PU’s signal, their transmission
is interrupted [9]. Thus, CRs require detection before attempting to use a particular spectral
band regardless of whether or not that band is occupied by PUs. In this work, we focus on pre-
allocated spectrum sections (SSs) for sensing, which separates the transmission link, to allow
sensing tasks to be completed in a shorter period and to reduce negotiation overhead.
First, let us define what ”spectrum section” means. The current regulatory system governing
wireless usage employs the principle of allocation, namely, dividing most of the radio spectrum
into a number of different bands, or sections for specific uses. Fig. 1 shows an example of this
allocation. Despite the increase in demand for wireless bandwidth, standard wireless networks
are restricted to a small portion of the spectrum, up to only 11 GHz. For example, the section
allocated for IEEE 802.11b/g, ranges from 2.402-2.483 GHz, and is separated into 14 spectral
bands (i.e., SS3). For example, when the PUs in an area do not use channels 1 and 2, which
cover spectral bands 0-3 and 5-8, spectral bands 0 to 8 are available for use by SUs in that area.
A trade-off exists between the collection of information about available bands and the time
required for spectrum sensing. Spectrum sharing may cause interference with neighboring nodes
[10]. Therefore, the CR uses information about SSs selected for sensing to increase matching
results. The main contribution of this work is to pre-allocate SSs to address the following issues.
• Sensing spectrum range limitation: The range, within which a section of the spectrum is
shared, is a factor to consider for reducing interference. Although each CR can sense over
a wide bandwidth [3], [4], [5], [11], the sensing spectrum is limited by the sensing time
[12] and functionality. In addition, there may be interference with other CRs if the same
bands are selected. Thus, the main issue is to share within common SSs, but to separate
the spectrums with neighboring active links.
• Sensing signal range limitation: The range, within which neighboring nodes share an
4ences among sets of spectral bands, the SSs are separately allocated to reduce the negotiation
overhead and increase the capacity with more cooperative CRs.
Accordingly, we are interested in key quality indicators of network performance, such as
unicast end-to-end delay, to compare the quality of our proposed group-based pre-allocated SS
scheme with general and link-based allocated schemes. A group is referred to by the active link
of the group, and those CR interfaces that are in the n-hop neighborhood are candidate members
of the group. We expect the proposed scheme to be advantageous due to the transformed available
bands, spectral band quality (error and interruption rates), improved transmission range and link
delay, as well as reductions in nodal delay due to sensing, negotiating, selecting, and switching
times. Both our proposed link and nodal delay models provide routing metrics [14], and average
end-to-end delay is the evaluation criterion for these schemes.
The main contribution of this work is the allocation and cooperation of available spectral bands
by sensing of pre-allocated spectrum sections. In the following section, the network model is
described in terms of the previous discussion. The proposed pre-allocation methods are expanded
in Section III. Evaluation is described in Section IV. Simulation results and related discussions
are presented in Section V. Finally, in Section VI, we offer our conclusions.
II. RELATED WORK
The rationale behind CRNs differs from that of Multi-Channel Networks (MCNs). In MCNs,
the set of channels associated with each node is constant, whereas in CRNs, each node can only
use the available bands during specific time intervals and within certain transmission ranges,
depending on the activity of the neighboring PUs [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. A number of fundamental
issues arise in CRNs that do not arise in MCNs.
• Single-radio with multi-channel: The majority of allocation mechanisms use packets [15],
nodes [16], links [17], flow [18], and segments [19] of fixed available channels. Having
only one radio per device has a number of benefits, including a saving in hardware cost and
a reduction in energy consumption [20]. However, a single-radio causes channel switching
6A review of the CRN literature revealed that most research on sensing issues has focused on
providing more opportunities for spectrum access to CR users without interfering with the PU
operations [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [23]. Based on the sensing framework, researchers proposed
spectral bands, spectrum selection, and scheduling methods [24] to maximize sensing capacity
[25]. They discussed difficulties in spectrum selection, but did not discuss how to address these
issues.
The minimum number of devices sharing a spectral band is two per pair of link transmissions;
the interference range determines the maximum number of devices. Current standard methods do
not pre-allocate SSs within the interference range [3], [8], [12], [25]. In the link-based method
[13], a pair of link transmissions may interfere with one another, unless precautions are in
place to prevent the selection of the same spectral band for communication. Until this situation
changes, the proposed group-based SSs pre-allocation scheme balances the available bands and
the cooperative sensing devices.
Research focused on cooperative sensing methods that maximize the number of spectral bands
[8], [11], [12], [26]. Although they provide efficient sensing mechanisms, these mechanisms
do not operate on the concepts of groups and pre-allocated SSs. As a result, there are fewer
common available bands due to differences in the sensing of the spectral ranges; furthermore,
the interference increases, due to sharing of common channels among a large number of devices
without separation.
Some researchers have addressed the interference that arises in channels in terms of allocation
in cluster-based MCNs [26]. These researchers suggest that dynamic channel allocation strategies
might regard multi-clustering structures as a coloring problem. Such strategies do not consider the
pre-allocation of common SSs among cooperative CRs, so group-members cooperate to sense,
negotiate, select, and switch to the negotiated partial set of available bands.
Other researchers have addressed segment-based channel assignment strategies in terms of
channel differential issues used by PUs. Channel assignment based on section granularity in
traditional link-based MCNs with only one CR attached on a node produced improvements in

Proof: Suppose the number of spectral bands that a CR can sense is the same. When both
nodes select different sections for sensing, the interaction between these two ranges (e.g., SSx
and SSy) is less than the single spectrum sensing ranges SSx. Because the set of available bands
Mτu is a subset of the spectrum sensing ranges of nodes u and v, the interaction among available
bands is also less than the interaction subset of these different SSs. As a result, the available
bands based on different SSs are not larger than those based on the same SSs, as shown in (4).

C. Sharing bias problem among available spectral bands
There are two ways to improve the utilization of available bands: (i) cooperative sensing and
(ii) available band sharing. In method (i), neighboring CRs help to sense the same spectral bands
and reduce the error and interruption rates to reduce the PU hidden terminal problem [27]. The
problem might occur when the signal strength of a PU is less than the range of the SU. In this
situation, the signal strength of the SU cannot be larger than the interfering PU’s transmission
range, as stated in Lemma 2. In addition, the cooperative sensing area of a CR is limited the area
of a transmission link, as stated in Lemma 3. Thus, the maximum transmission range determines
the effective sensing and negotiating ranges, as stated in Lemma 4.
Lemma 2. The signal strength of the SU cannot be larger than the neighboring PU’s trans-
mission range.
Proof: If the transmission range of PU is less than the SUs’, the SUs’ range may cover PU,
but it cannot sense PUs’ signal. Fig. 4 shows an example of where the signal of PU2 cannot be
12
Lemma 4 The effective sensing and negotiation ranges are determined by the maximum
transmission range.
Proof: Suppose that each CR can adjust the transmission range where the range is deter-
mined by the required signal strength for the link nodes to communicate with each other. Once
the range of a link l(u,v) is given, the associated neighboring nodes, which are in the interference
area, are determined. Therefore:
• From the perspective of SU to PU interference: Outside of the transmission range, PU will
not be affected, so the sensing range only needs to cover the interference range. The reason
is that the transmission range is limited to the maximum transmission range or the widest
interference range to PU, as stated in Lemma 1.
• From the perspective of SU to SU interference: If there are two transmission pairs with
the same spectral bands, interference occurs. However, two hops away from the nodes, the
signal will not cover the current transceiver so they will not interfere with each other.
• From the perspective of PU to SU interference: Since a signal from PU will interrupt the
SU’s transmission, there is no interference from PU to SU.
Fig. 4 shows an example of the effective available band area in which CR c transmits a packet
to CR d, which replies ACK after receiving the packet. The CR nodes a, g, e cooperate to sense
the available bands for transceiver (c, d) within a one-hop range, which are determined by the
maximum transmission range.
Allocating disjointed sets of SSs to links has the advantage that it is simple to select the set
of available bands Mτ(u,v), but the disadvantage is a reduction in the selectable bands because
the number of allocated SSs is reduced. Thus, in method (ii), the available bands sensed by
neighboring CRs, are shared as a pair of link nodes. To cover the transmission area, at least
one pair of CRs senses the same SS when the sensing range is equal to the transmission range.
In Fig. 4, the interfaces of nodes c and d select the same spectrum section SS2 such that the
available bands of this section are shared for link (c, d) within range areas II and III.

the system capacity. Once at least two paths within the sensing range are identified, the
cooperative range is limited to 1-hop to maximize the capacity since fewer cooperative CRs
are required.
TA(u, v, SSx)− (SA(i′, , SSx) ∪ SA(j′, , SSx)) ̸= ∅∀(u, v)(i′, j′) ∈ L;SSx ∈M (7)
Based on the previous analysis, the cooperative range is limited to 1-hop when the following
issues are considered: (i) maximum link capacity; (ii) minimum negotiation cost; and (iii) a
cooperating CR mechanism, which is simple to assign, and which does not need a complex
coverage theory. Thus, a group is formed by the multiple radii within the 1-hop cooperative
sensing and sharing CRs. As we are considering nodes with multiple radii, each node may
belong to multiple groups with different radio interfaces, but each radio can only belong to one
group in a period. As shown in Fig. 4, an active link (c, d) extends to the set of radii attached
to the nodes a, g, e, and f , which interface with devices c or d. The radii m and h of node g
belong to Group2.
D. Problem Formulation
Our approach to modeling the problem makes certain assumptions: (i) The sensing range is
equal to the maximum transmission range; (ii) Each CR controls its transmission range to avoid
interference; (iii) A CR uses an existing spectrum sensing scheme [3] to detect locally available
channels; (iv) The periodic exchange of routing, negotiation, and spectrum pool messages use a
common channel [28]; (v) A pool of SSs, maintained on each device, stores information about
SSs selected for other links or groups.
The set of source to destination transmission pairs is denoted as R. The end-to-end delay of
each pair r, denoted as dr, is evaluated for comparison with the related schemes, providing the
average delay function D as (8), which yields (9) to (20).
16
The link (u, v) belongs to the specific flow r at time τ and is denoted by yτr(u,v). A decision
variable yτ(u,v) set to 1 indicates that an active link (u, v) is selected by any flow r; a value of
0 indicates that the link is not an active link. Eq. (9) describes how yτ(u,v) must be 1 for any
flow routes via link (u, v) at time τ .
yτr(u,v) ≤ yτ(u,v), ∀(u, v), υ ∈ V (9)
The set of radii attached to node υ is denoted by eυ. From the perspective of a link, a decision
variable ϕi(u,v) equal to 1 indicates that a CR interface i (∈ eu or ev) belongs to the group of
active link (u, v) at time τ , as shown in (10). A link that fulfills (11) is thus a member of only
one active link (group).

(u,v)∈L
ϕi(u,v) ≤ 1, ∀i ∈ eυ, υ ∈ V (11)
Any member of a CR interface i is at most one hop from the active link (u, v). In terms of
the CR members of a link pair, the hop count from the CR interface i to the active link (u, v),
denoted by hi(u,v), is therefore not greater than 1, as shown in (12).
hi(u,v)ϕi(u,v) ≤ 1,∀(u, v) ∈ L, i ∈ eυ, υ ∈ V (12)
Each link is associated with at least one SS, but not more than n SSs, as shown in (13). The
variable αs is a binary variable for the spectrum section SS(u,v) ∈M . If a SS is assigned to both
nodes of a link (u, v), then the value of αs is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The connection
state of link (u, v) is δ(u,v). The value of (u, v) equals 1 if the link is connected; otherwise, it is
0. A SS is assigned to those links for which δ(u,v) is equal to 1.

Equation (19) limits the node-to-node delay for each time slot. Based on derivations from our
previous work [14] on link delay and nodal delay functions, both delays are calculated for a
node u packet transmission to the next hop. When the interruption rate θ(u,v) is considered, other
available bands must be found for retransmission, so the expected retransmissions are formulated
with a geometric distribution as follows:
(D(u,v)(cτ(u,v),fτ(u,v))+Q(M,ψu))
(1−θ(u,v)) ≤ tτ(u,v),∀(u, v) ∈ Lr, r ∈ R, τ ∈ T (19)
Equation (20) limits the end-to-end delay for each flow. The end-to-end delay is calculated on
the left-hand side of this equation, along the routing path for each flow r. The average end-to-end
delay is yielded by (8).

IV. SOLUTION OF SPECTRUM SECTION ALLOCATION
This section introduces the proposed group-based spectrum section allocation scheme and a
distributed protocol for spectrum sensing and routing algorithms.
A. Group-based scheme
The distributed scheme followed by each device participating in group-based cooperative
sensing is as follows.
20
• CR REPORT : For each result sensed by a CR, the available bands are included in the
CR REPORT message. This message is sent to the active link.
3) Operations: We outline the procedures for a group-based scheme as follows:
Step 1 At beginning of a period, each CR broadcasts a CR EXCHANGE message
to exchange the allocated SSs.
Step 2 Based on the route cache, A CR sends a CR CONSTRUCTION message
to its opposite-link CR. The responding node replies ACK to form a new group.
It also sends a CR LEAV E message to its current group if this node does not
have enough CR interfaces for the current group. This step satisfies Eq. (9)-(10).
Step 3 Both nodes of the transmitting link broadcast CR CONSTRUCTION mes-
sages to one-hop neighboring nodes inviting them to join the group. If a CR
interface does not belong to any group, but is only 1-hop away from the new group,
neighboring CRs, including their opposite-link CRs, reply with a CR JOIN mes-
sage to be a member of the group for cooperative sensing and sharing. This step
satisfies Eqs. (11)-(12).
Step 4 Once a group forms, the sender and receiver broadcast a CR ASSIGNMENT
message to allocate the SSs to its group members such that Eqs (13)-(14) are
satisfied.
Step 5 Each node sends its available bands via a CR REPORT message to the
active link. Accordingly, the active link calculates the available bands and the link
capacity for transmission based on (16).
These distributed SS allocation procedures describe how the group both senses and shares
the set of available bands for an active link. The link capacity is then calculated based on (16).
Once the link capacity is determined, the link and nodal delays, as shown in Eq. (19), are also

Fig. 6 Simulation results for the different sensing and
negotiating time.
Fig. 7 Simulation of the effect of a different number of SSs
(with a fixed total range of SSs) on end-to-end delay.
Fig. 8 shows the simulation results for simulation (ii). For all schemes, the end-to-end delay
decreased as bandwidth increased and the number of SSs also increased. The number of SSs
was fixed for both link- and group-based schemes. Thus, the delay decreases when there are
fewer interruptions caused by PUs and more opportunities to obtain available bands. However,
when there is a sufficient number of SSs, the general method achieves better solutions as the
number of SSs is not limited.
The interference range of a node has a positive correlation with its transmission range,
the number of neighboring nodes and the group size. Fig. 9 shows that the overall average
end-to-end delay of a group-based scheme is better than either of the other schemes. As the
transmission range increases, the interference range also increases, which results in an increase
in the average end-to-end delay. For the link-based scheme, SSs allocated to a link are not
shared with neighboring nodes; therefore, the available bandwidth has greater variance, because
it is significantly affected by PUs. In conditions with wider bandwidth, opportunities for data
transmission are not always available due to the network utilization of PUs.
Fig. 10 shows the effect of different numbers of SUs on the end-to-end delay for different
allocations of SSs. As the number of SUs increases, the average group size increases and more

spectrum range should be sufficiently short; without this condition, the interruption rate is higher.
The most important factor for each transmission is capacity. Capacity is primarily determined
by the time and the number of available bands. To maximize the capacity, the error and inter-
ruption rates need to be reduced. Thus, for group-based SS allocation, we address the central
issues simultaneously: (i) increasing the matching rates of the available bands, and (ii) reducing
the error caused by interference to maximize the capacity.
There is a trade-off between group size based on coverage, the number of nodes, or the number
of hops, and performance. When the group size is too small, the number of cooperative CRs
reduces. However, when the group size is large, an increased number of links share common
resources (in this case, a fixed number of SSs), and the probability of sharing common spectral
bands is high, resulting in an increase in overall interference. Thus, adaptively setting the group
size to optimize performance based on transmission range is still an open issue.
From the perspective of fairness, the number of cooperative CRs among the groups should
be balanced. If the number of CRs is large for some groups, the number of available bands is
large, but the available resources are low for other active link, causing long transmission delays.
In addition, the path length, traffic load, and link conditions result in delay differentiation. Thus,
designing an advanced pre-allocation of SS to minimize the maximum delay differentiation

報告內容包括下列各項：（請另備 A4 大小紙張書寫） 
 
一、參加會議經過 
  本次會議是在利物浦(Liverpool)舉行的 IUCC & AUCN 2012 國際研討會，為了減少
機票開支，本次選擇最低價的航班前往，於 6/20 下午 5:40 飛抵上海且住進該公司所提供
位於浦東機場的過境旅館，第二天早上 11:30 再搭乘上海到倫敦的班機，晚上於當地時
間 18:50 飛抵英國倫敦，這次為了調整時間且搭配班機時間關係，所以提前了二天到英
國，於 6/24 早上 11:00 再由倫敦搭程火車前往利物浦，會議的地點就在利物浦火車站附
近，但市區的旅館較貴，於是就訂到稍微郊區的地方，搭公車其實也只需要幾分鐘就到
了。 
  因時差的關係，6/25 起了個大早會場，沒想到早上 8:30 報到櫃台已大排長攏，為了
參加第一場 Keynote Speech，於是打算延後報到，但演講結束之後依然還是很多人再報
到，但接下來有一場 Session 要主持（如附件 3a 所示），只好延到中午再報到，會議安
排得不錯每一位都有來報告。中午用餐剛好遇到來自西安交通大學的博班同學且與他聊
聊大陸的情況。 
  第二天我依然起了個大早，走路到會場參加了 Jie Wu 針對路由概念的演講，10:30
我也有另一場 Session 需要主持，哇！竟然安排了八位報告者，而且還有報告者想提前到
這個 Session 報告，幸好沒有加入，因為這個 Session 就超過了近半小時結束，而午餐採
用限量的 buffet 方式進行，要排隊且慢到的就吃不到好料了，於是中午的時候就走掉了
一半的人，還好也順利完成了這項任務。 
  本人的報告時間是在下午 16:00 這一場，同樣的以不背稿的方式進行，但時間也花
得多了一些，並且還是有點緊張，但已比過去要好得多了。報告結束後，緊接著就是晚
餐(dinner)，想說到了當地就選擇當地的西餐，體驗一下當地原汁原味的料理方式，但比
過去參加過的晚宴(Banquet)來得簡單多了，一個多小時就結束了，與同坐的大陸中科院
就近散步且聊聊兩岸的發展。 
  這個會議主要的議程都排在前二天，每一個時段就有 10 個 Sessions，反而在第三天
6/27 早上只有二個時段，中午前即結束了。當天下午順便搭火車返回倫敦，以準備第二

面臨的關鍵問題進行深入研究。 
 
四、考察參觀活動（無是項活動者省略）：無 
 
五、建議 
  在這次的會議中亦有幾位是來自亞洲的學者與研究生，由聊天中發現中國大陸與韓
國對於參加研討會的重視，大陸的研究生即提供註冊費與全程機＋酒，韓國更是提供任
何足額的機票費，甚至提供倫敦到利物浦的機票費，反倒是這次參加原本還計畫與另一
個在日本舉辦的會議一起進行，即由日本轉機，轉機的過程再由到日本報告，只是這樣
的安排搭乘日籍航空反而比較貴，只好就罷！於是花費了更多的時間在等待轉機上。因
此，建議能就參與國際研討會能在經費上寬裕些，或者是可以彈性點以放寬業務費可以
流用至這個項目中，而不要到了國外為了節省開支而住在郊區，反而其他亞洲國家與會
者則是住在會議的飯店，差異頗大且實在有些過意不去。

POSTER SESSION OF IUCC-2012 AND ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS 
27 June 2012 (W
ednesday) 
Based on the contribution of each sensed spectrum and the
transmission effectiveness to set the length of contention
windows (CWs), SUs used MAC to control the available
resource priority [7][8]. The CR with short length of CWs
obtains high priority to have longer available bands usage
time. This work studies the weight of each flow, remainder
path, and the network conditions of remainder path to
achieve transmission delay bias weighted balancing.
Liu et al. adopted the same concepts with Wang’s methods
[9][10] to manage the spectral bands. Record the conditions
of spectrum segments, such as spectral segment utility, the
ratio of interruption, and error rate, to evaluate the quality
of spectral segments. The better quality set of spectral
bands is priority selected to enhance channel access chances
and improve system performance [8]. This work uses this
concept to allocate the spectral resource.
Some works studied the spectral bands access based on the
priority queuing between PUs and SUs. A PU possesses the
highest priority to use the spectral bands. Zhang et al. adopt
this concept to different packet weights on transmission
queue. The main idea is to let PUs always have highest
priority when they require sending data. SUs possess low
priority to send the data only when no PUs transmissions
[11]. The priority idea is different from this work.
III. NETWORK MODEL AND PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS
This section describes the network architecture, weighted
spectral bands, delay bias, priority, and the problem.
A. Network Architecture
Based on the concept of a multi-hop CRN, there are many
nodes, which attached with CRs, possess capability to self-
organization with or without infrastructure supporting in an
area. The network is modeled by a connected graph G(V, L),
where V represents the set of nodes, and L represents the
set of links. The node set V contains two subsets VSU and
VPU as SU and PU nodes, respectively. Each link (u, v) ∈
L has a capacity cτ(u,v) (units/ms) for each time slot τ .
Each node v ∈ VPU has its transmission range and allocated
channels. The prior knowledge of link (u, v) ∈ L represents
the maximum transmission range that node u could reach
node v. Figure 1 shows an example that a set of pairs X
transmit packetized streaming with variable bit rate γx(x ∈
X) in a multi-hop CRN. The routing path is periodically
searched with our previous work [4]. Each CR has a buffer
that uses to store different types of packets. Each packet is
marked two time stamps: one is link estimated time; another
is delay bias from source node to current node.
B. Weighted Spectral Bands
To achieve resource allocation accurately, the spectrum is
divided into multiple base bands, which are the base unit
to modulate as a channel [3][11][12]. For example, four
spectral bands form one channel in IEEE 802.11 [13]. When
Figure 1. The network architecture of our research problem.
PUs in an area do not use channels 1 and 2 (which cover
spectral bands 1-4 and 6-9, respectively), spectral bands 1
to 9 are available to formed a new channel by SUs.
Suppose the number of spectral bands |M | is large
enough, no duplicate bands allocation for transmission
within interference range. Each node calculates a weight
based on the conditions of a spectral band m, including
moderate bandwidth bτm, the available rate aτm, the inter-
ruption rate of PUm and error rate eτm, in the CR pool. The
CR pool means a set of initialized spectral bands (denoted as
Λu ∈M ) that are kept higher available to use. The weights
of recent n time slots at time pi are considered to calculate
the average weight wm(m ∈ Λu), as shown as (1).

The sensed spectral bands are numbered to represent a
series of available bands, which are denoted asMτv by node
v at time τ . Each link adopts one or more available bands
for transmissions. The available range rm and duration µm
of each allocated bandm should be long enough to reach the
next hop and cover the given fixed cycle time tτ [4]. Since
the signal range is limit, the interference and transmission
ranges are bounded so that the resource allocation is limited
within transmission range [3].
C. Delay Bias Model
The concept of delay bias (denoted by dρ), which is
defined as the difference between the current packet delay
and the maximum tolerable delay at the current hop for
packet ρ. The maximum tolerable delay at the kth hop-node
(e.g., k = 0 means the first node of a path) for a nx-hop
path is then expressed by hx × (k + 1) and hx is the per-
hop tolerable delay Dx//nx, where Dx is the maximum
end-to-end tolerable delay for the flow x. The smaller the
delay bias (i.e., dρ = tρ − hx × (k + 1)), where tρ is the
transmission time of packet ρ at this hop-node), the longer
the waiting time that the packet can tolerate without missing
the deadline. This bias value d is carried in each packet
header, and the delay bias of each packet to the current node
can be used as an indicator for scheduling. In this way, for
recorded in the decision variable qτ(u,v).

(1− ϕτ(i,u))qτ(i,u)
]
≤ qτ(u,v),∀(u, v) ∈ L;τ ∈ T
(8)
Based on the packet position in the queue, the
decision variable φτρu is marked to 1 when the
capacity suffices to transmit it; otherwise, it is
marked as 0, as in (9). Once a packet is transmitted
to the next hop v, we set the variable φτρu to 1,
as in (10), otherwise 0.
qτ(u,v)−tτ cτ(u,v)
N ≤ φτρu,∀ρ ∈ P, (u, v) ∈ Lp, τ ∈ T (9)
zτρu − φτρutτ cτ(u,v) ≤ q(τ+1)ρu,
∀ρ ∈ P, (u, v) ∈ Lp, τ ∈ T (10)
If the number of queued packets plus packet ρ is
smaller than the capacity cτ(u,v), then packet ρ is
transmitted to the next hop at this time slot. If a
packet is not transmitted to the next hop, it will
be shifted to the position within the current queue
according to the capacity in this time slot, as in the
left-hand side of Constraint (11). Whether a packet
is to be transmitted to the next hop is determined
by variable φτρu. The queue length qτ(u,v) and all
incoming packet sizes determine the position zτρv
of packet ρ in the queue of the next hop node v.

bτ(i,u)(1− φτρi)
]]
≤ zτρv, ∀ρ ∈ P, (u, v) ∈ Lp, τ ∈ T
(11)
According to the hop-node marked by φτρu and
the amount of tolerable delay on the current link,
the delay bias is updated in Constraints (12).
tτ−1p(u,v) + tτφτu + t ≤ tτp(u,v),

• The packet delay bias at a specific time constraints
(13): each packet is scheduled based on the delay
bias, priority, queuing size, and the rate of PU’s in-
terruption in each outgoing link queue. The aggre-
gated delay from source node to current node for
a time slot pi is included as a parameter of priority
equation to limit the amount of sensing spectral
bands. Based on the packet and queue status with
the decision variables, the delay bias value from
the source to the current node at a specific time
can be calculated. The maximum delay bias is then
minimized by the objective function.

4) To determine:
• Decision variable fτm is used to determine whether
a sensing spectral band is allocated on link (u, v)
(fτm = 1) or not (fτm = 0) at time τ .
• The link capacity cτ(u,v): that is calculated based
on the sensed available bands in time τ .
• The queue size qτ(u,v): The number of packets are
queued on the transmission link (u, v) in time τ .
• The decision variable ϕi(u,v) equal to 1 indicates
a CR interface i (∈ euorev) belongs to the group
with central link pair (u, v).
• The decision variable φτρu equal to 1 indicates a
packet ρ on node u is sent to the next-hop node in
time τ
• Packet time stamp tτp: The time value of packet
transmitted time is marked when it is sent out from
the source node.
• Packet queuing position zτpu: how many packets
queued in the front of packet at time slot τ .
• Transmission time tτϕ(u,v): The time used to trans-
mit packet ρ on link (u, v) in time τ .
IV. SOLUTION APPROACH
To minimize the maximum delay bias within the inter-
ference range of the active link by a greedy method, the
available bands are allocated to these packets with highest
weight, which is calculated by F (αρ, hρu, kρu) in the current
time slot, as the highest priority. The problem is how much
resource should be allocated to flows such that the delay
biases among the different priority flows are balanced.
The priority-based schemes to determine the proportion
θτ(u,v) of the allocated bands with negotiation targets are
designed. The set of sensed available bands at each time
slot is distributed allocated to each active link based on
the proposed allocation proportion scheme ητ(u,v), which is
yielded by the weight function F (αρ, hρu, kρu) of packets
ρ in the queue of outgoing link (u, v) at time τ , divided by
the summation of the packet weights within the interference
range I(u,v)(i,j), as shown in (14).
ητ(u,v) =
∑
ρ∈P
dρF (αρ,hρu,kρu)∑
(i,j)∈L
∑
ρ∈P
I(u,v)(i,j)dρF (αρ,hρu,kρu)
,
∀ρ ∈ P ; (u, v) ∈ Lp; τ ∈ T
(14)
Accordingly, the Priority-based Available Spectral Bands
Allocation (PASBA) algorithm are described as followings:
Step 1 Each CR exchanges the available spectral bands,
queuing size, and allocation proportion ητ(u,v) message,
which is yielded by (14), between neighboring nodes within
the interference range. Each link keeps the spectral bands
only available for itself. It requires the remainder allocated
bands to its neighboring nodes.
Step 2 The node with the highest proportion selects and
announces the subset of available bands that (i) belongs to
(a) Throughput
(b) End-to-end delay bias
Figure 3. Different priorities evaluation
function. Only bottleneck packets affect the objective value
when the maximum reciprocal of a packet’s transmission
delay bias is minimized. Also, the allocation of resources to
the non-bottleneck link does not affect the value, even if a
node’s delay bias is quite short, or just shorter than that of
a bottleneck packet.
To achieve global load balancing with local resource
allocation, the maximum delay bias among different flows
are minimized locally to minimize the end-to-end delay,
evaluated in terms of the average end-to-end delay bias. Our
results show that the more the resources give to packets with
higher delay bias and links with higher rates of interruption,
the better the performance.
VI. CONCLUSION
This work studied the weighted resource allocation prob-
lem for CRNs with different weights of flows. the proposed
approach is to minimize the maximum delay bias among
different flows, and to minimize the end-to-end delay, ac-
cording to the sensed available spectral bands. We consider
a multi-hop network with a spectral band pool and link-based
interference model. Based on CR features, a greedy-based
allocation schemes are proposed and evaluated in terms of
the average end-to-end delay bias that is solved with a local
delay bias fairness. Our results show that more resources
give packets with higher priority and delay bias and links
with higher rates of interruption, the better the performance.

(英文) This work designs on the distributed cooperative radii sensing with low error rate and low 
interrupted rate to enhance the spectrum resource utilization. The selected spectral 
sections are disjoint with the neighbouring SUs within interference range. A tolerable 
end-to-end delay concept is proposed to determine whether the transmission delay of a 
flow is overdue or not. On the other words, each packet records its aggregate tolerable 
delay from source node to current node and the transmitted delay. Then, each node 
calculates the delay differential between aggregate tolerable delay and the transmitted 
delay. If the differential (i.e., delay bias) value is larger than 0, its means the packet is out 
of schedule and more resource are allocated for this node. This is a distrusted algorithm 
because each node only considers the negotiation and load balancing within interference 
range. Accordingly, the related parameters are obtained with a near-optimal solution to 
enhance the CRNs performance.
