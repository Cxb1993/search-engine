speed with gust fluctuations, which has zero 
mean when averaged over about 10 minutes [1]. 
Owing to the air disturbance caused by ground 
obstructions, the air flow becomes even more 
chaotic and forms turbulence [1]. 
All the flows in nature that we can observe 
are turbulent flows. The characteristics of 
turbulence flows described in Tennekes et al. [1] 
are: irregularity, diffusivity, dissipation, and 
continuum. Besides these properties, 
turbulence’s intrinsic nature also includes 3-D, 
non-periodic, contains vorticity, and follows 
entropy principle, i.e. laminar flow will always 
leads to turbulent flow, not vice versa. The 
focal point of this work is to investigate the 
influence of heavy rain on HAWT, therefore as 
a first approach we can average out the 
fluctuation and simplified the turbulent 
atmospheric wind as 3-D cross winds from 
different directions. 
The focal point in this research is heavy 
rain. Heavy rain generally are the by product of 
strong vertical convection within the 
spring-summer thunderstorm over a vast land 
mass. The falling, collision, and capturing of 
different water droplets will lead to the growth 
of rain drops, but surface tension effect can put 
a cap of rain drop’s size. The heaviest recorded 
ground rainfall occurred during an intense 
thunderstorm in Unionville, Maryland, on July 
4, 1956, when a rainfall rate of 1874 mm/hr 
was recorded for a period of only about 1 
minute. Typically, ground-level rainfall rates 
are much lower than this, with the heaviest 
rainfalls occurring for 30 seconds or less. From 
aerodynamic viewpoint it is the rainfall rate, 
not the total rainfall, which will induce the 
most detrimental effects. 
To quantify the phenomena of rain, 
Marshall et al. first introduced the concept of 
drop size distribution (DSD) in 1948 [4]. The 
DSD is a useful statistical method to measure 
the concentration of rain drop size at particular 
rain rate. DSD follows an exponential 
distribution and is expressed as 
            (1) 
where N(D) (m-3/mm) is the concentration of 
rain drops at an interval of ΔD (mm), D (mm) 
the rain drop diameter and N0 the intercept 
parameter with a fixed value of 8.0 × 103 
m-3/mm, Λ (mm-1) the slope parameter with 
relationship shown as 
            (2) 
with R is the rainfall rate intensity in mm/hr. 
But it is found that the distribution either 
under-predicts or over-predicts the peak of the 
concentration in very light or heavy rain. 
In 1983, Ulbrich [5] found the accuracy of 
concentration can be improved if the 
exponential distribution is assumed to be a 
gamma distribution. The gamma distribution is 
a three-parameter distribution expressed as: 
                  ሺ3ሻ 
 
Also the Liquid Water Content or LWC (g/m3) 
also has relationship with rainfall rate intensity 
R (mm/hr) shown as 
           (4) 
In equation (3), Λ (cm-1) the new slope 
parameter and α the shape parameter in 
modified gamma distribution are now shown as 
follows: 
                 (5) 
                  (6) 
The modified gamma distribution is again 
expresses the concentration of rain drops at an 
interval of ΔD in the air. The numbers of all 
rain drops ND (cm-3) at specific rain rate can 
now be calculate by integrating the modified 
gamma-distribution: 
  (7) 
Since in numerical simulation we cannot 
handle every size of rain drops, a representative 
5 
also measured at five spanwise stations: 30%, 
46.6%, 63.3%, 80%, and 95% span. 
To validate the rotating turbine blades, the 
cylinder with 24 m diameter is created; a disk is 
created around the turbine blades, with 
thickness of 1 m and diameter of 12 m to 
simulate the rotating motion. Also, another 
cylinder zone behind the actuator disk is used 
to validate the wake vortex which flow over the 
trailing edge of the blades. The whole domain 
is shown in Fig. 2, which contains about 3.3 
million unstructured grids. 
Our HAWT simulation is first validated 
with experimental data which is at free stream 
speed of 7 m/s and a rotational speed of 72 rpm 
[7]. The presented results are fully-turbulent 
converged steady state runs using the SST k-ω 
model. The pressure coefficient (Cp) is defined 
as 
        
(10) 
The measured and computed pressure 
distributions of NREL phase VI wind turbine 
are shown in Figs. 3~7, the differences between 
experiments and simulations are acceptable. 
Reasonable agreement is found from 30% to 
80% sections. The difference at the 95% 
section could be resulted from the approximate 
blade tip shape. But recent progress made in the 
tuning of inner “blade mesh disk thickness” can 
lead to the improvement of pressure 
distributions at the last two sections, as shown 
in Fig. 8~9, with 3.65 represents 3.65 millions 
grids, etc. Table 1 indicates that compare with 
the experiment; current torque is 
under-predicted by 6.2% and the thrust by a 
mere 0.3%.  
 
5. Results and Discussion 結果與討論 
Generally the rotational speed of rotor 
blade should be change with incoming wind 
speed. However, experiments [7][8] indicated 
that the change of wind speed only increases 
rotational speed slightly in NREL phase VI 
HAWT (Table 2). Thus wind is assumed as 
constant speed blows from 3 different 
directions; our HAWTs are assumed to have the 
same modified kinetic energy or dynamic 
pressure. Table 3 shows the cross wind 
conditions of case 1 and 2, while case 0 
represent the original perpendicular incoming 
wind. 
Table 4 shows both torque and thrust 
degradations of wind turbine operating under 
different cross wind, and the results indicate 
significant change in both thrust and torque. 
When increasing the yaw angle, torque could 
reduce as much as 96%. The pressure 
distributions also reveal the large difference 
(Figs. 10~14). These indicate the importance of 
having a straight incoming flow in wind turbine 
operation for maximum electricity benefit. 
While this constant direction wind condition 
can be easily obtained in the prevailing wind 
seasons or geographic regions, it will create 
some major operation problems in gusty wind 
situation, such as hurricane or typhoon seasons. 
The pressure contours on blade windward 
and leeward are shown in Figs. 15~17. These 
contours show considerable spanwise pressure 
variations in addition to the chordwise 
variations. For wind blows at a certain angle, 
flow will accelerate the local flow velocity on 
the lower blade, meanwhile decelerates the 
local flow velocity on the upper blade, and thus 
causes the pressure differences. The flow 
patterns also indicate that when yaw angle 
increases, acceleration decreases on the upper 
surface (leeward). It is obvious that as the wind 
speed holds as constant, the yaw angle 
increasingly reduces the effective angle of 
attack. This change reduces the rotational force 
which is the source of torque and increases the 
drag (known as induced drag). For case 0, the 
wind turbine is in optimal condition which 
creates maximum lift. It is also observed that 
the stagnation point shifts toward leading edge 
as the yaw angle is increasing. 
Now if considering a HAWT operates

Currently there one Ph.D. student is still doing refine works on this 
project, and hope to finish his whole 
research in next several months. We submit part of this work to 2012 AIAA 
aerospace sciences meeting last year, 
with the feedback review opinion that our idea of simulated rain effects 
is quite creative and new, but the 
verification of last wind turbine blade section is not quite right. In 
last three months we gradually gain more 
experience in mesh system and now can achieve good agreement with 
benchmark data (Figs. 8~9 of report). Thus we 
plan to present our new results in the forthcoming AIAA conference and 
submit to the Journal of Wind Engineering 
recently.
