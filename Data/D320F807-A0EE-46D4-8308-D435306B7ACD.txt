Abstract 
 
  Dynamics of wave propagation over a muddy seabed is studied. The main 
achievement of present project is to theoretically investigate a three-layer wave-mud 
system using the Voigt model to simulate the muddy material. Dispersion relation, 
amplitude ratios and phase lags between each interface are obtained.  Laboratory 
measurements are also carried out to simulate a linear wave passing over a trench where 
the syrup is used to be the bottom material. Wave profiles and resonance are measured 
and discussed. This preliminary experiment is quite important for further experiments 
using mud as the bed material. In conclusion, present study provides a significant basis 
for related studies.

2.3 Results and discussions 
  A three-layer is theoretically constructed for wave-mud interaction. Potential 
theory is applied to above two inviscid layers and the mud layer is simulated by a 
viscoelastic material. In present paper, linear solution is solved and the dispersion 
relation is expressed in six powers of exponent in frequency. This implies that three 
modes of motions may be excited. It is noted that, as some varialbes are complexes

Fig. 2. Experimental set-up and regular waves passing over a submerged trench 
3.1.2 Dense fluid 
Our selected heavier fluid is made by brown sugar with water, which gives a clear 
density-stratified vision and causes less damage to facilities than salt water. 
Furthermore, such fluid is similar to fine sediment because its rheology contains 
degrees of stickiness. Two different densities (1.05 g/cm3 and 1.20 g/cm3) and two 
different thickness of heavier fluid (4cm and 8 cm) were used in the experiments. The 
sugar-water mixture was prepared 1 day before the experiment to avoid being moldy. 
The trench is stratified by first filling tap water to a depth of 30 cm above bottom. The 
prepared brown sugar water was fed into the bottom of the trench carefully and slowly 
through a pliable tube to form a layer of dense fluid. In order to find out best 
proportion to make selected density of sugar-water mixture, we use of Archimedes’s 
principle first to make an approximate density, and followed by try-and-error method 
from withdraw samples in the trench. Because in a miscible fluid the density 
discontinuity is evened out by molecular diffusion, the effects of diffusive interface 
will be examined. By taking samples at different depths and locations the uniformity 
of specific gravity of sugar water was examined. About 20-c.c. sample at each 
position was collected into a pre-weighted aluminum pan. These pans were oven dried 
at 103-105  ℃ for 24 hrs and then weighted for calculating the real density. Therefore, 
the exact proportion of sugar and water was determined.

one quarter of a wavelength downstream from the trench, then the location of the 
trench is near the node of a standing surface wave where the horizontal component of 
the fluid velocity is the largest. This has not been done in this study and is 
recommended for future work. 
In Fig. 4 the time histories of the internal waves and of the surface waves are 
presented for a wave period of 1.26 s, which corresponds to a critical condition in the 
trench. As seen in Fig. 7, the waveforms of the internal waves are nonsymmetrical 
about the quiescent density interface, whereas the waveforms of the surface waves 
appear to be symmetrical about the mean water level. The latter indicates that 
nonlinear effects in the surface wave profiles are small. From these internal wave 
records one also gets an idea that mixing at the interface must be small, otherwise the 
density stratifications in the trench would be constantly changing, hence the internal 
motions would approach steady-state condition in a more complicated fashion. 
Besides, we can observe a little phase lag between two waves; it may become from 
the effect of stickiness in sugar. 
An important aspect of the interaction of surface waves with a density-stratified 
fluid in a submerged trench is the resonant oscillations of internal waves in the trench. 
However, not all wave conditions in our investigations induce excited response. In Fig. 
5, the internal wave height at the maximum nodes of the trench, b , normalized by the 
wave height of the surface wave above the node, Hi, is plotted as a function of kw., 
where k is the wave number of the surface wave in the constantdepth above false 
bottom obtained using the linear inviscid theory; w is the width of the trench. For all 
wave conditions, the excited responses are induced when the incoming wave is 
limited within in a particular frequency. However, we cannot find the trend for most 
dense and thick fluid due to the ability of wave generator. This can be improved by 
changing the width of trench. 
It is also important to note that the response curve of Fig. 5 results in an efficient 
filter for frequencies away from resonance, so that the high-frequency components in 
the surface waves contribute very little to the motion of the internal waves. Thus, the 
non-symmetrical waveforms observed in the internal wave record are due to truly 
nonlinear behavior in the internal wave motions. In our investigation, two conditions 
easily induced large oscillations. One is the dense layer with a thickness of 8 cm and 
density of 1.05 g/cm3. The other is the dense layer with a thickness of 4 cm and 
density of 1.20 g/cm3.

are derived and discussed. Waves passing over a submarine trench are experimentally 
calculated as a preliminary for further mud-wave experiments. Wave profiles and 
resonance are measured and discussed. We believe that present results will be a strong 
basis for further mud-wave studies.

The detailed calculation of the error function ( )xerf  is 
referred to Abramowitz and Stegun’ mathematical handbook 
[6]. Equation (13) is the so-called complete solution which can 
describe the flows in any time.  
III. RESULTS 
The solution to extended Stokes’ first problem is examined 
in this section. From (13), it is found that U  will approach 
( ) 2/erfc Y  and 0 as ∞→Z  and −∞→Z , respectively. It 
indicates that the far-end flow either above the right plate 
( )0>>Z  or the left plate ( )0<<Z  will not be affected by the 
motion of another plate. Velocity profiles for various values of 
Z  are depicted in Fig.2. It is shown that the velocity 
distributions for 0>Z  and 0<Z  gradually approach unity 
and zero, respectively. This implies that the energy obtained 
from the moving plate is gradually delivered to the whole fluid. 
It is also remarked that present solution is identical to Zeng 
and Weinbaum’s solution [2] which was expressed in another 
integration.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 
In this study, the flow motivated by a moving half-infinite 
plate is theoretically analyzed for the sake of simulating the
