wavelet-based SFDC (WB-SFDC) beamformer not
only rejects the frequency components lying out-
side the bandwidth but it is also robust to the
angular errors.
2. BACKGROUND
Let a set of vectors x(t) represent the received data
derived from the N elements of a uniform linear
array. For a broad-band signal with frequency f
and arrival angle θ, the steering vector a(f, θ) cor-
responding to x(t) can be expressed as
as(f, θ) = [e2πf(1−n0)µ(θ), · · · , e2πf(N−n0)µ(θ)]T
(1)
where n0 is the reference point of the array, and
µ(θ) = d sin θ/c with d denoting the sensor spacing
and c denoting the propagation velocity. The su-
perscript T denotes the matrix transpose. Assum-
ing that this data vector x(t) consists of a single
desired signal with direction angle θd, J interfer-
ing signals with direction angles θj, j = 1, 2, · · · , J ,
and received noise. The steering vectors of the
desired signal and j-th interfering signal can be,
respectively, expressed as ad
∆
= as(f, θd) and aj
∆
=
as(f, θj).
The tapped-delay line filters are often used for
the adaptive beamformer to establish a broad-band
null. The traditional GSC with K tapped-delay
section is shown in Fig. 1. The vector x¯(t) stacks
K consecutive received data x(t) into one vector.
It can be expressed as
x¯(t) = [xT (t),xT (t− 1), · · · ,xT (t−K +1)]T (2)
The direction vector corresponding to x¯(t) is given
by
a¯(f, θ) = af ⊗ as(f, θ) (3)
where
af = [e
−2πf(1−k0)Td , · · · , e−2πf(K−k0)Td ]T
with k0 denoting the reference point of the tapped-
delay line and Td denoting the temporal sample
delay, and ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. The
direction vectors of the desired signal and j-th
interfering signal can then be, respectively, ex-
pressed as a¯d
∆
= a¯(f, θd) and a¯j
∆
= a¯(f, θj).
Let wf , B¯ and wa be the fixed weight vector,
blocking matrix and adaptive weight vector of the
GSC, respectively. The fixed weight vector wf
is constrained to preserve the desired signal at the
look direction θ = 0o. The blocking matrix B¯ nulls
out the desired signal, and then the weight vector
−B¯wa provides the desired interference suppres-
sion at array output. In [4], a narrow-band SDC
beamformer has been addressed to flatten the spa-
tial response so that the array is less sensitive to
the angular errors. Since the desired signal for a
broad-band beamformer is band-limited in the fre-
quency domain, a flat spatial-frequency filter can
be used to extract the desired signal from the re-
ceived data vector. In the next section, we use the
SFDC technique to establish this flatter band-pass
filter.
3. WB-SFDC BEAMFORMER
Note that the fixed weight vector wf can be re-
garded as a 2-D digital filter with spatial and fre-
quency variables. This 2-D band-pass filter is cen-
ter around (f, θd) = (f0, 0o), where f0 denotes the
center frequency. Let fu and fl be, the highest
frequency and the lowest frequency of a¯(f, θ), re-
spectively. The center frequency f0 can be defined
as f0
∆
= (fu+fl)/2. From the definition of a¯d, the
(r1+r2)-order partial derivative of a¯d with respect
From the property of Kronecker product (A1 ⊗
B1)(A2 ⊗ B2) = (A1A2)⊗ (B1B2), we have
B¯HC¯ = 0, if P ≥ R1 (15)
It implies that such a matrix B¯ can be employed as
the blocking matrix in the GSC structure. The re-
sulting output main-lobe response not only rejects
the frequency components lying outside the band-
width but it is also robust to the angular errors.
The response of (1, 5)-order WB-SFDC is shown in
Fig. 2. We can observe that the SFDC approach
has a flat main-lobe in the spatial-frequency plane.
Note that B¯ also satisfies the orthogonality
condition
B¯HQHn wf = o (16)
where
Qn = afa
H
f ⊗ IN (17)
is the noise spectrum matrix corresponding to the
vector x¯(t). It has been shown in [1] that the
blocking matrix of a broad-band GSC must satisfy
the orthogonality condition (16). In [7], we also
describe a 2-D blocking matrix as
B˜ = [IK ⊗Bs,01] + [Bf ⊗ IN ,02]
where Bf is the same as Bs except that the di-
mension of matrix is replaced by K× (PK−MPl
v
+
1)(M − 1), 01 and 02 are zero matrices with ap-
propriate sizes. It can be verified that the matrix
B˜ satisfies the condition B˜HC¯ = 0. However,
B˜ is not applicable to this new approach since
B˜HQHn wf W= o.
4. SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION
Some simulations are conducted in this section to
justify the proposed approach. For comparison,
three algorithms are considered:
(a) the (R1 − 1)-order SDC beamformer,
(b) the (R1 − 1)-order SDC beamformer with
leaky algorithm [9],
(c) the proposed beamformer with order (R1−
1, R2 − 1) and null-constrained algorithm [8].
The parameters chosen for B¯ of the proposed
beamformer areM = 4, P = R1, and l =M . The
temporal sample delay Td in the tapped-delay line
is chosen as Td = 1/(2fmax), where fmax denotes
the maximum sensor output frequency. The array
elements are spaced at one-half the wavelength of
the frequency fmax.
We employ a uniform linear array consisting
of N = 28 sensors with K = 16 tapped-delay sec-
tions and (R1 − 1, R2 − 1) = (1, 5). The received
data vectors consist of two interferers. The direc-
tions of arrival are equal to θ1 = 25o and θ2 = 35o
for interference with η1 = 30 dB and η2 = 20 dB,
respectively. Figure 3 illustrates that the new al-
gorithm has a flat response in the design region.
We can observe that the proposed algorithm yields
larger angular beamwidth compared with previous
works.
In Fig. 4, we plot the output SINR versus
the direction of desired signal θd. The frequency
interval of the received noise is chosen to be fTd ∈
(0.1, 0.5). The input SNR of the received data
vectors in Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b) are ηd =
10dB and ηd = 50dB, respectively. Comparing
Fig. 4 (a) with Fig. 4 (b), the main-beam width
is a constant that is independent of input SNR.
We can also observe that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the others.
Figure 5 plots the output beam-pattern in the
presence of angular error 2o. The signal, interfer-
ence and noise are band-limited with flat spectral
density over the same normalized frequency band
