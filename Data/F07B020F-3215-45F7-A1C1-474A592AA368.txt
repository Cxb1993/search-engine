Wave propagation and attenuation through elastic porous medium containing 
two immiscible, viscous, compressible fluids 
Abstract 
A central issue in the successful application of acoustic wave method to detect subsurface 
hydrological properties is a better understanding of the influence of soil texture on the 
propagation and attenuation of acoustic wave as moisture content is varied, which was 
numerically investigated in the present study.  Our earlier studies have demonstrated the 
existence of three different modes of acoustic wave in an elastic porous medium containing two 
immiscible, viscous, compressible fluids.  Based on the dispersion equation obtained in the 
Lo-Sposito-Majer (LSM) model, the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the P1 and P2 
waves which respectively propagate the fastest and second fastest were determined as a function 
of water saturation for eleven soil texture classes.  The slowest wave (P3) was not characterized 
in this study since it does not travel far, due to very high attenuation.  To provide a more general 
result, the calculated phase velocity and attenuation coefficient for different soil textures were 
normalized by those computed for sand.  The normalization leads the resulting dimensionless 
parameters to be frequency independent throughout the whole range (up to 500 Hz) with Darcy’s 
law remaining valid for the description of each fluid flow under wave excitation.  The 
normalized phase velocity of the P1 wave was shown to have a substantially constant value at 
higher water saturations, but in the lower saturation range it first increases to reach a certain 
maximum value for different soil types and then decreases.  The physical parameter controlling 
this phenomenon is the ratio of two effective non-wetting fluid storativity factors.  Numerical 
results reveal that the normalized attenuation coefficient of the P1 wave is sensitive to soil texture 
and water saturation.  Sand and loamy sand have the highest and second highest attenuation 
coefficients for the P1 wave, respectively.  The magnitude of the normalized phase velocity of 
the P2 wave is found to be, with very few exceptions at nearly full saturations, linearly associated 
with the intrinsic permeability, while relating to the normalized attenuation coefficient of the P2 
wave in an opposite manner.  These results provide a quantitative clue for acoustic wave method 
to explore the physical properties in the shallow subsurface.

1. Introduction 
Over the past decades, the increasing scientific focus on the poroelastic behavior of a 
fluid-containing porous medium has generated great interest in connecting the velocity and 
dissipation of acoustic waves to the hydrological properties of the shallow subsurface, on which 
immense practical applications to soil science, agriculture engineering, geomechamics, resource 
engineering, and hydrogeology are being built (Garambois et al., 2002).  An inverse issue is to 
use reflection and refraction seismology to infer the spatial distribution of permeability, porosity, 
and moisture content of sedimentary materials, as well as to detect the type of pore immiscible 
loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and clay 
(Rawls et al., 1992).  After normalized by the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient 
calculated for sand, those for the remaining ten soil textures are shown to be independent of 
excitation frequency at wave bands ranging up to 500 Hz, beyond which relative motion between 
fluid and solid is of the Darcy’s type under wave oscillation.  These normalized parameters will 
not only allow application of the results to other cases without having to perform an entire set of 
numerical simulations but can also serve as a basis for low-frequency acoustic wave methods 
used to measure the physical properties of soil, such as moisture content, porosity, permeability, 
and material density.  One of the practical applications for environmental remediation is to 
locate NAPL (nonaqueous phase liquid)-contaminated sites in groundwater aquifers by obtaining 
the distribution of seismic wave velocity and attenuation. 
2. Dispersion relation  
The coupled partial differential equations describing dilatational wave propagation and 
attenuation through a partially-saturated porous medium were formulated by Lo et al. (2005) 
using continuum mechanics of mixtures (Lo et al., 2002).  Their model equations, derived in an 
Eulerian framework, take the form

where ω  is the wave excitation frequency; rk k iki= +  is a complex wavenumber that includes 
attenuation,  being the conventional wavenumber and  being the 
attenuation coefficient.  The parameters , , , and  are functions of inertial, 
viscous, and elastic coefficients and their relation was determined in equations (57) of Lo et al. 
(2005).  Evidently, equation (5) is a cubic polynomial equation in

ω  and will therefore 
generally have three complex roots.  When the wave excitation frequency is stipulated, the 
phase speed (

ω ) and attenuation coefficient ( ) can be determined.  Since the amplitude of the 
bulk waves always diminishes with distance due to viscous dissipation, the attenuation coefficient 
must be positive, .  This implies that there are only the existence of three roots for .  
Accordingly, the cubic polynomial equation (5) classifies three types of compressional wave 
(Tuncay and Corapcioglu, 1996; Lo et al., 2005).  That denoted by P1 has the highest magnitude 
of phase velocity, followed by P2 and P3 in descending order.  The P1 and P2 waves are 
analogous to the fast and slow dilatational waves in Biot theory.  The P2 and P3 waves exhibit a 
diffusion phenomenon and the latter (the P3 wave) is related to the relationship between capillary 
pressure and relative fluid saturation (Santos et al. 1990; Tuncay and Corapcioglu, 1996; Lo et al., 
2005).  The P3 wave thus disappears when the pore space is saturated by a single fluid.

3. Simulation results 
The cubic polynomial equation (5) for a given excitation frequency was solved 
numerically to seek the complex wavenumber k for eleven soil texture classes.  The material

soils.  Loamy sand has the second highest attenuation coefficient for the P1 wave.  Lastly, it is 
noted in Figures 5 and 6 that the normalized phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the P2 
wave are closely related to the intrinsic permeability.  When a soil has a higher intrinsic 
permeability, the normalized phase velocity of the P2 wave is greater while the normalized 
attenuation coefficient of the P2 wave is smaller.  Two minor exceptions to this observation 
occur only at  between silt loam and sandy clay loam, and at  
between silty clay loam and sandy clay.  This proportional relation provides an informative 
indicator in linking acoustic waves to the ability of soils in transporting fluid flows.  Therefore, 
the combination of acoustic wave characteristics obtained from our investigation concerning the 
normalized phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the P1 and P2 waves should be able to 
serve as a theoretical and quantitative basis for acoustic wave method to image the physical 
properties of partially-saturated unconsolidated soils, such as moisture content.

4. Conclusions 
Accurate mapping of subsurface hydrological parameters, such as permeability, porosity, 
and fluid saturation, is central to characterizing the subsurface distribution and flow of fluids.  It 
has been widely recognized that reflection and refraction seismology provides a non-invasive, 
non-destructive means to acquire spatially subsurface physical properties.  The present study 
systematically investigates changes in two important acoustic wave signatures (speed and 
attenuation) due to the influence of fluid saturation and soil texture.  Based on the dispersion 
relation derived in the Lo et al. (2005) model, the phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of 
three different modes of acoustic wave were determined as a function of water saturation for 
eleven different types of unconsolidated soils.  A more general result was presented by 
normalizing the calculated phase velocity and attenuation coefficient of the P1 and P2 waves that 
respectively propagate the fastest and second fastest into a dimensionless form using those 
obtained for sand.  By doing so, these dimensionless parameters were found to be independent 
of excitation frequency up to 500 Hz, a critical frequency assuring that each fluid flow is of the 
Darcy’s type under wave excitation for all soil texture classes examined.  Because of its very 
high attenuation, the P3 wave whose speed is the slowest was not considered in the present study.

Numerical studies show that the maximum value of the normalized phase velocity of the 
P1 wave occurs at water saturations between 0 and 0.2.  Silty clay has the highest magnitude, 
followed by clay, silty clay loam, sandy clay, clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy 
loam, and finally loamy sand.  A dimensionless ratio of 2 /M M  is found to be the controlling 
parameter responsible for the occurrence of the maximum value.  The normalized attenuation 
coefficient of the P1 wave is significantly affected by soil texture and water saturation.  Sand 
and loamy sand have the highest and second highest attenuation coefficients for the P1 wave at 
all degrees of saturation, respectively.  Lastly, in reference to the P2 wave, the behavior of its 
propagation and attenuation was demonstrated to be closely associated with the intrinsic 
permeability of unconsolidated soils.  Except at 2 0.99S =  between silt loam and sandy clay 
loam as well as at  between silty clay loam and sandy clay, the normalized phase 
velocity of the P2 wave is linearly proportional to the intrinsic permeability while its normalized 
attenuation coefficient has an inverse relation to it.  Therefore, clay has the lowest phase
