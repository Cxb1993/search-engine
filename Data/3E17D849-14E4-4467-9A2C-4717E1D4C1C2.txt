Earth Pressure on Retaining Walls with Intrusion of a Stiff Interface into 
Backfill (2/3) 
 
Abstract 
 
This report studied earth pressure at-rest near a vertical rock face. Dry Ottawa sand was used as 
the backfill material. The horizontal earth pressure in a loose (Dr = 35%) soil mass was measured. 
The height of backfill H is 1.5 m. The instrumented non-yielding retaining-wall at National Chiao 
Tung University was used to investigate the variation of earth pressure with different spacing d 
between the model wall and the interface plate. The spacing d used for testing was 1500, 1100, 
900, 700, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 and 50 mm. Based on the experiment results, the following 
conclusions were made. (1) The horizontal earth pressure σh decreased with the decrease of 
spacing d. Jaky solution can be considered as the upper bound for estimating earth pressure near a 
vertical rock face. (2) When the spacing d is very small (d ≤ 300 mm), the measured earth 
pressure σh is even lower than the Rankine active pressure and did not change with depth. (3) 
Janssen’s method provided a good estimation for the earth pressure coefficient Ko,h under 
different wall-rock face spacing d.

point of view, the deformation of the sidewalls could be considered negligible.  
 
To reduce the friction between backfill and sidewalls, a lubrication layer consisted of plastic 
sheets (Fang et al., 2004) was furnished for all mode-wall experiments. The lubrication layer 
consisted of one thick and two thin plastic sheets were hung vertically on each sidewall of the soil 
bin before the backfill was deposited. The thick sheet was placed next to the soil particles. It is 
expected that the thick sheet would help to smooth out the rough interface as a result of 
plastic-sheet penetration under normal stress. Two thin sheets were placed next to the steel 
sidewall to provide possible sliding planes.  
 
3.3 Data Acquisition System 
 
The Data acquisition system used for this study composed of the following four parts: (1) 
dynamic strain amplifiers (Kyowa: DPM601A and DPM711B); (2) NI card; (3) AD/DA card; and 
(4) PC. The analog signals obtained from the sensors were filtered and amplified by dynamic 
strain amplifiers. Analog Experimental data were converted to digital data by the A/D - D/A card. 
The LabVIEW program was used to acquire experimental data. Experimental data were stored 
and analyzed with the Pentium 4 personal computer.

4. VERTICAL INTERFACE PLATE AND SUPPORTING SYSTEM 
 
To study the earth pressure on the retaining wall near a rock face, a vertical interface plate was 
constructed to fit in the soil bin of the NCTU model retaining-wall facilities. As shown in Fig. 4.1, 
the system consisted of two parts: (1) steel interface plate; and (2) supporting system. Details of 
the interface plate and supporting system were described in the following sections.  
 
4.1 Steel Interface Plate 
 
The steel interface plate shown in Fig. 4.1 is 2.1 m-long, 1.497 m-wide, and 4.5 mm-thick. To 
simulate a hard rock face and to increase the rigidity of the thin steel plate, 5 × 8 steel L-beams 
in the longitudinal and transverse directions were welded at the back of thin steel plate. The steel 
interface plate was designed to be 1.497 m-wide so that it could be placed into the soil bin 
successfully. The surface of the steel interface plate was covered with a layer of Safety-Walk to 
simulate the friction on the rough rock face. 
 
4.2 Supporting System 
 
To ensure the interface plate to remain vertically and stable, supporting system behind the steel 
plate was developed. The supporting system consisted of the following three parts: (1) top 
supporting beam; (2) base supporting frame; and (3) base spacing plate. 
 
4.2.1 Top Supporting Beam 
 
In Fig. 4.1(a) and (b), the sectional dimension of the top supporting beam was 65 mm × 65 mm 
× 8 mm and its length is 1950 mm. In Fig. 4.1(c), the beam was fixed at the back of the plate and 
it is fixed to the soil bin with screws.  
 
4.2.2 Base Supporting Frame 
 
Four types of base supporting frames were fabricated to achieve appropriate spacing between the 
interface plate and the end wall. Dimensions of the frames included: (1) 1487 × 1210 × 125 
mm; (2) 1467 × 845 × 125 mm; (3) 1195 × 297 × 125 mm; and (4) 1195 × 130 × 125 mm.  
 
4.2.3 Base Spacing Plate 
 
To ensure the spacing d between the interface plate and model wall, and to keep the interface 
plate vertical, base spacing plates were placed between the model wall and the interface plate. Fig. 
4.2 showed, for the spacing d = 900 mm between the model wall and the interface plate, two 300 
× 200 × 17.5 mm and two 700 × 400 × 17.5 mm spacing plates were arranged to achieve the

5. BACKFILL AND INTERFACE CHARACTERISTICS 
 
5.1 Backfill Properties 
 
Air-dry Ottawa silica sand (ASTM C-778) was used for the model wall experiments. For the 
air-pluviated backfill, an empirical relationship between soil unit weight γ and φ angle was 
formulated as follows: 
 
φ = 6.43γ– 68.99                     (5.1) 
 
where φ = internal friction angle of soil (degree); γ = unit weight of soil (kN/m3); Eq. 5.1 was 
applicable for γ = 15.45 ~ 17.4 kN/m3 only.  
 
5.2 Side Wall Friction 
 
To reduce the friction between sidewall and backfill, a lubrication fabricated layer with plastic 
sheets was furnished for all model wall experiments. For the plastic sheet method (1 thick + 2 
thin sheeting) used in this study. The measured friction angle with this method was about 7.5o.  
 
5.3 Model Wall Friction  
 
A 88 mm × 88 mm × 25 mm smooth steel plate, made of the same material as the model wall, 
was used to replace the lower shear box. Ottawa sand was placed into the upper shear box and a 
vertical load was applied on the soil specimen. The relationship between γ and wall friction angle 
δw For air-pluviation Ottawa sand can be expressed as follows: 
 
δw = 3.41γ-43.69                         (5.2) 
 
Where δw = wall friction angle (degree), and γ = unit weight of backfill (kN/m3). 
 
5.4 Inclined Interface Friction 
 
A 80 mm × 80 mm × 15 mm steel plate was covered with the anti-slip material Safety-Walk to 
simulate the interface behavior between the sandstone and the sandy fill. For the backfill prepared 
with air-pluviation method. 
 
                         δ i = 2.7γ- 21.39                        (5.3) 
 
where δi = interface-plate friction angle (degree), and γ = unit weight of soil (kN/m3).

7. CONCLUSIONS 
 
This report studied the earth pressure on a non-yielding wall near a vertical rock face. Based on 
the experiment results, the following conclusions can be drawn. 
1. The distribution of horizontal earth pressure obtained for d = 1500 mm was in good 
agreement with the Jaky, and Spangler and Handy solutions. 
2. For the spacing d = 1100 mm to d = 500 mm, the distribution of horizontal pressure was in 
fairly good agreement with Janssen’s prediction. 
3. When the spacing d is very small (d ≤ 300 mm), the measured earth pressure σh was even 
lower than Rankine active pressure and it did not change with depth.  
4. The horizontal earth pressure σh decreased with the reduction of spacing d. Jaky’s solution 
could be considered as the upper bound for estimating earth pressure near a vertical rock face. 
5. Janssen’s method provided a good estimation for Ko,h coefficient under different spacing d.
