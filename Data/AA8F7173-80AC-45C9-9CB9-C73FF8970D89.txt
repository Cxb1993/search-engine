biomedical engineering applications, it is often 
necessary to compute higher order derivatives of 
biomedical data. The differentiators are mainly 
implemented in circuits for low-speed applications. 
Thus, the implementation of differentiators for 
high-frequency applications has been largely 
ignored. 
    Various methods have been developed to 
design both discrete finite impulse response (FIR) 
and infinite impulse response (IIR) differentiators 
[2]–[7]. Al-Alaoui [2] used Simpson’s rule to 
develop astable second-order recursive 
differentiator. Tseng [3] studied a fractional-order 
FIR differentiator by solving linear equations of 
Vandermonde form. In order to develop a 
wide-band differentiator, Khan and Ohba [6] 
employed the central difference approximations 
of the derivative of a function to obtain a 
maximally linear differentiator. An important 
aspect of the previous investigation is that the 
exploration focused on the improvement of 
linearity over a wide frequency band. 
     Most of the differentiator studies thus far  
elaborated on discrete-time signal processing 
(DSP) techniques for the applications in 
low-frequency microchips. In particular, many 
Z-domain formats of transfer functions have been 
obtained to represent the characteristics of a 
differentiator. In this paper, we present the 
scattering characteristics of equal elec-
trical-length transmission lines in the -domain [8], 
[9]. As a result, the transmission-line 
configuration can emulate the characteristics of 
the differentiator developed in a DSP study, and 
the operating frequency band of a differentiator is, 
thus, extended further into the microwave range. 
Both first-and second-order differentiators are 
implemented with microstrip lines, of which the 
operating frequency is determined by the 
physical length of each line section. It is, 
therefore, plausible to fabricate differentiators 
having operating frequencies larger than 10 GHz. 
The close agreement between theoretical values 
and experimental results further validates the 
proposed scheme. It is pertinent to point out that 
the transmission lines considered here are 
assumed to be both lossless and dispersionless. In 
particular, the dispersion effect between 
microstrip lines of different widths over a wide 
bandwidth is neglected for the current 
consideration. 
 
2. Discrete-time differentiators 
It is well known that the operation of a time 
derivative of a signal is represented by a 
complex-frequency variable in the Laplace 
transform representation. Neglecting the loss 
factor, the complex-frequency variable is equal to 
jω , i.e., s= jω, where is ω is the signal angular 
frequency. As a result, a differentiator is a 
high-pass filter and the amplitude of its system 
function increases linearly as the signal 
frequency increases. We consider a 
transformation relating the complex-frequency 
variable s and the discrete-time variable z in the  
 
 -4- 
shown in Fig. 1. If d=0.1658, the  the relative 
error is  less than 1% (or -40dB) when 
0≦Ω≦0.8π. For d=0.1658, we therefore adopt 
(1) as the system function of the differentiator in 
a discrete-time IIR format and the selected 
s y s t e m  f u n c t i o n  o f  t h e  
first-order differentiator is

If we implement a circuit with the system 
function shown in (3), the differentiator is 
accurate for the operating frequency up to 0.8 of 
the normalizing frequency. With a finite error tol-
erance, such a differentiator has a wider operating 
frequency bandwidth than those previously 
reported [7]. In particular, the concise 
mathematical expression will lead to a simple 
circuit configuration of the differentiator. 
For a second-order differentiator, the system 
function is obtained by squaring (3), i.e., 
 
 
After defining the discrete-time system 
functions, the remaining task is to implement 
both first-and second-order differentiators with 
equal electric-length transmission lines. In other 
words, we synthesize the transmission-line 
circuits so that their transfer functions are similar 
to the system functions of differentiators.

are dependent variables, while a(2) and b(2) are 
independent variables. Table I shows the matrices 
for two transmission-line configurations [8], [9], 
namely, the serial transmission line and shunt- 
short stub in the Z-domain, where βi (i= a, b) ,li, 
and Zi are the propagation constant, physical 
length, and characteristic impedance, respectively. 
Note that Zo is the reference characteristic 
impedance, which is assumed to be 50Ω, unless 
otherwise mentioned. 
It is assumed that all finite lines have the 
same electrical length, ie., βa la= βb lb = ωτ, where 
τ is the propagation delay time of finite lines. To 
obtain the T matrices in the Z-domain, we set  
z-1 =e-j2βili. 
    From (5), if the output port of a shunt-short 
stub is loaded with a matched termination (i.e., 
a(2) =0), the transfer function of the shunt-short 
stub T(z) is given by 1/T11(z). From table I, we

the ground termination of shunted finite lines is

ing the reference 50-Ω lines on both sides is 29.43 
mm. Fig. 7 shows the experimental results, as well  
as the simulated values of the transmission coeff- 
icient S21(f) and reflection coefficient S11(f) of the 
second-order differentiator for frequencies ranging 
from dc to 10 GHz. As shown in this figure, the 
measured frequency-domain results agree very 
well with the theoretical values for frequencies up 
to 0.8 of the full-band normalizing frequency. 
    To examine the characteristics of the differenti- 
ators in the time domain, we employ ramp signals 
as input signals to the de- vices. Fig. 8 shows the 
experimental results of the first-order differentiator 
when ramp signals with rise times of 100 and 150 
ps are incident upon the device shown in Fig. 4. 
The 150-ps ramp signal is turned into a square wave, 
while the 100-ps ramp signal is transformed into a 
distorted pulse signal. The amplitudes of output 
signals decrease in both cases. Little ripples 
appear on both the rising and falling edges of 
output signals. Notice that the rise time of output 
signals becomes 50 ps for two different input 
signals. On the other hand, the output signals have 
a different fall time. The output signal associated 
with the 100-ps rise-time input signal has a larger 
fall time. In Fig. 8, the theoretical results of output 
signals are shown to compare with the measured 
results, wherein the propagation delay time of 
transmis- sion lines is taken into account. Fig. 9 
shows the output signals of the second-order 
differentiator when the same ramp signals are 
incident upon the device shown in Fig. 6. Both 
output signals appear as distorted triangular 
waveforms. The output signal associated with the 
input signal of 100-ps rise time has a larger 
peak-to-peak value. In particular, two outputs 
decrease significantly, and the time duration of 
two outputs lasts longer than that of output signals 
in the first-order differentiator. For convenience, 
the theoretical results of output signals are also 
shown for comparison with the measured results. 
 
5. Conclusion 
    Simple and accurate formulations have been 
employed to represent both first- and second-order 
differentiators in the Z-domain. In particular, the 
Z-domain representations of scattering characteri- 
istics of equal-length nonuniform transmission lines  
facilitate the implementation of discrete-domain 
differentiators in the microwave frequency range. 
These differentiators have been implemented by 
using microstrip transmission lines. The experim- 
ental results agreed very well with the simulated 
values. It is possible that many other circuits dev- 
eloped in DSP studies can also be implemented by 
using transmission lines for microwave applicati- 
ons.

Abstract 
A model describing the time constant of a 
transmission-line integrator is presented. By 
representing the formulations of integrators in the 
discrete-time (or Z) domain, we implement the 
integrators with equal-length transmission lines. 
Three integrators with different time constants 
and frequency bands are built and tested. The 
experimental results are in good agreement with 
theoretical values.

1. Introduction 
The integrator is an instrumental tool to 
estimate the time integral of measured  signals. It 
has been used extensively in many areas, such as 
coherent detection, correlation estimation, 
accumulator analysis and waveform shaping [1]. 
The integrator can also be employed to measure 
the delay times of microwave transistors [2] or it 
can be used to implement high-frequency active 
filters [3]. In other words, not only the integrator 
 Fig.1 An electronic integrator.  
 
plays an important role in determining the 
inter-relation among various signals, but also it 
can detect the history of the signal itself. In the   
Fourier spectral analysis, the spectral of a 
measured signal is the output of an integrator that 
takes the time integration of the multiplication of 
measured signal by harmonic signals [1]. Thus 
far, the integrators are mainly employed in 
circuits for low-speed applications. Therefore, the 
implementation of integrators for high-frequency 
applications has been largely ignored. 
     A serial R-C circuit, in conjunction with an 
operational amplifier, has been widely employed 
to form an integrator [2]-[4]. However, the 
configuration of such a circuit is good only for 
low-speed applications. Many other techniques 
have been developed to design integrators using 
finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse 
response (IIR) methods in the study of 
discrete-time signal processing (DSP) [5]-[7]. 
Among various techniques, trapezoidal rule and 
Simpson's rule in the Z domain are two popular 
methods used for integrators. The

the output voltage Vo(t) is related to the input 
voltage Vi(t) through the following relation  
,)(1)( dttVtV io ∫= τ          (3) 
where t is the time. (3) reveals that the 
output  Vo(t) of an integrator is inversely 
proportional to the time constant. Since no 
appropriate method can be employed to obtain 
the equivalent capacitor C and resistor R of an 
integrator implemented by using transmission 
lines, we assume that (2) is valid to get the time 
constant of an integrator. 
 
3. Transfer Functions of Integrators in the  
  Z  Domain  
Many techniques have been developed to 
design integrators using finite impulse response 
( FIR ) or infinite impulse response ( IIR ) 
methods in the study of DSP  [6]-[7].  The 
trapezoidal-rule integrator in the Z domain is as 
follows [1]

where z-1 is the unit of time delay. Notice that the 
trapezoidal-rule integrator in (4) represents a 
bilinear transformation, which also transforms 
the system function in the frequency domain into 
the corresponding system function in the 
discrete-time domain [1]. In particular, a zero 
exits at z= -1. When the frequency domain 
response of the integrator is concerned, z in (4) is 
replaced with the following relation 
,Ω= jez               (5)

where Ω is the frequency angle ( or normalized 
frequency ) and 0≤Ω≤π. An integrator can also be 
obtained by inverting the transformation of a 
wide-band differentiator in [9]. This gives us the 
following

The amplitude response of an ideal integrator is 
also shown in Fig. 2, which is inversely 
proportional to the normalized frequency. Both (4) 
and (6) deviate from the values of an ideal 
integrator in the upper frequency band. To obtain 
an integrator which fits better the ideal integrator 
over the entire normalized frequency band, a new  
integrator is set as follows

Table I shows the chain-scattering 
parameter matrix of a serial transmission line in 
the Z domain, where βa, la and Za are the 
propagation constant, physical length and 
characteristic impedance, respectively. Notice 
that Zo is the reference characteristic impedance, 
which is assumed to be 50 ohms unless 
mentioned otherwise. It is assumed that βa la=ωT, 
where T is the propagation delay time of the 
finite line. The chain-scattering parameter matrix 
is obtained by setting aaljez β21 −− = . The relation 
between the frequency angle Ω and the 
transmission line parameters is Ω=2βala=2ωT. 
If a transmission-line configuration consists 
of M serial sections, the overall chain scattering 
parameter T11, overall (z) of such a circuit is obtain- 
ed by the sequential multiplication of the chain- 
scattering parameter matrices of all transmission

S21(z) as possible. Notice that Bi in (11) is 
determined using the optimization method [8] in 
the sense of minimum square error for the 
coefficients of denominators on both sides of 
(11), we obtain the characteristic impedances of 
transmission lines. We may employ the same 
procedure from (8) to (11) to attain the 
characteristic impedance profiles for both 2Hz(z) 
and 3Hz(z). To implement an integrator with 
equal-length transmission lines, the electrical 
length of each transmission line is set to 90˚ at 
the normalizing frequency ( Ω = π ). We thus 
have l = λ0/4, where l is the physical length of 
each transmission line section and λ0 is the 
wavelength at the normalizing frequency.

As mentioned in the previous section, the 
magnitude of S21(f) has a value of unity for the 
frequency range 0 GHz≤ f ≤1 GHz. Therefore, the 
circuit in Fig 5(a) behaves as an integrator for the 
frequency band 1GHz≤ f ≤10GHz. It has a time 
constant of 1.6·10-10s. The experimental results of 
the circuits in both Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) also fit 
well with the theoretical values over the 
respective frequency ranges. In particular, the 
time constants of the circuits in both Fig. 5(b) and 
5(c) are 0.8·10-10 and 0.53·10-10 s, respectively. To 
illustrate the circuit behavior of integrators in the 
time domain, we show in Fig.7 the responses of 
integrators with a square wave as the input signal. 
The integrators turn the square wave into the 
triangular wave. In order to make a good 
comparison, the time delays are adjusted so that
