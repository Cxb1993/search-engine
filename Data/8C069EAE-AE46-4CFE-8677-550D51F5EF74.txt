英文摘要： The main purpose of this study is to develop a novel 
electrochemical system, can effectively treat the organic 
wastewaters in the high-tech industry. In the first year, we will 
develop the electrocoagulation system on treatment of organic 
wastewater (PVA and DMSO) and pharmaceutical wastewater 
(salicylic acid, SA). For treatment of PVA, several parameters were 
evaluated to characterize the emoval efficiency, such as various 
electrode pairs, current densities, supporting electrolytes, 
temperatures, and initial electrolyte concentrations. The optimum 
electrode pair, current density, supporting electrolyte, and 
temperature were found to be Fe/Al, 5 mAcm-2, 0.008N NaCl, and 
298 K, respectively. The adsorption of PVA was best fitted by the 
Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters 
such as the △G, △H , and △S indicated that the adsorption of 
PVA on metal hydroxides was feasible, spontaneous and 
endothermic in the range of 288 to 318K. For treatment of DMSO, 
the optimum electrode pair, applied voltage and electrolyte 
concentration were found to be Al-Al electrode pair, 20V, and 200 
mg/L, respectively. For treatment of SA, several parameters, 
including electrode materials, pH variation, voltage, and 
temperature, were investigated. The optimum electrode pair, voltage 
and temperature were found to be Al/Al electrode pair, 20V and 
308K, respectively. In the second year, the development of the 
Electro-Fenton or Fenton system will be designed to treat PVA, 
DMSO, and SA. For treatment of PVA by EF, several parameters 
were evaluated to characterize the PVA removal efficiency, such as 
solution pH, current densities, and temperatures, and initial 
electrolyte concentrations. The optimum pH, current density, and 
temperature were found to be 3, 7.5mAcm-2, and 303K, 
respectively. For treatment of DMSO by Fenton, we investigated the 
effects of different process parameters, such as the H2O2/Fe2+ 
molar ratio and Fe2+ concentration, initial pH values and 
temperatur. The results indicated that the optimum Fe2+, initial pH, 
and temperature were 0.05M, 3, and 298 K, respectively. For 
treatment of SA by E-F, the optimum electrode pair, current density, 
solution pH, and oxygen saprging rate were found to be activated 
carbon fiber as cathode, 3.2 mAcm-2, 3, and 500 mlmin-1, 
respectively.

中文摘要 
光電半導體業 (Opto-electronic industry)為二十一世紀全球最具發展潛力產業之一，年
產值可達 1.6 兆元。隨著產量之增加，相對產出之有機廢水量也大為提升。其中在 TFT-LCD
製程廢水中，有機廢水約佔總廢水量三分之一以上，預計未來高科技產業每日所生產之廢
水量更將達 200,000 噸以上。這些有機物質來源主要是製程中所使用大量之二甲基亞楓 
(dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) 、 聚 乙 烯 醇  ( polyvinyl alchohol, PVA) 、 乙 醇 胺 
(monoethanolamine, MEA)、氫氧化四甲基胺 (tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide, TMAH)，
若無法有效處理，不僅對人體健康造成危害，更可能影響生態環境。因此，本研究計畫第
一年係利用電混凝技術來處理水溶液中之有機物聚乙烯醇及二甲基亞楓，並包括處理醫療
與染整工業常用之水楊酸 (Salicylic acid, SA)，研究中所選擇各種操作條件，如不同電極
配位、電壓、電流，電解質濃度及溫度等參數對於含各種不同溶液中汙染物去除效率之影
響，並以去除每公斤或每立方公尺廢水中之汙染物液濃度所需之電能消耗做為實驗操作條
件最適化之依據；首先，PVA 部分，實驗結果顯示，定電壓系統以陽極為鐵、陰極為鋁為
最適合之電極配位；而最適當之操作電壓及電解質濃度分別為 10 V 及 100 mg L-1，在此操
作條件下，其 PVA 去除率可達 90 %以上；而在定電流系統同樣以陽極為鐵、陰極為鋁為
最適當之電極配位；最適之操作電流及溫度分別為 5 mA cm-2 及 298 K，在此操作條件
下，其 PVA 及 TOC 去除率分別可達 90 %及 80 %以上，並由實驗數據求出不同的等溫
吸附模式，得知 Freundlich 的吸附模式較適合描述整個電混凝吸附去除程序；再來，在
DMSO 部分，實驗結果顯示，定電壓系統以陽極為鋁、陰極為鋁為最適合之電極配
位；而最適當之操作電壓及電解質濃度分別為 20 V 極 200 mg L-1，在此操作條件下，
其 DMSO 溶液中 TOC 之去除率亦可達到 60 %以上；最後，在 SA 部分，實驗結果顯
示，定電壓系統以陽極為鋁、陰極為鋁為最適合之電極配位；而最適當之操作電壓及溫度
分別為 20 V 與 308 K，在此操作條件下，其水楊酸去除率可達 90 %以上。而本研究計畫
第二年係利用電芬頓或芬頓氧化技術分別處理水溶液中之聚乙烯醇、二甲基亞楓及水楊
酸；在電芬頓氧化研究中所選擇各種操作條件，如不同 pH、電流及溫度等參數對於含聚乙
烯醇溶液中 PVA 去除效率之影響，並以去除每公斤或每立方公尺廢水中之 PVA 所需之電
能消耗做為實驗操作條件最適化之依據；而在芬頓氧化研究中所選擇之各種操作條件，如
過氧化氫與亞鐵離子的比例、亞鐵離子濃度、起始 pH 值及溫度等參數對於水溶液中 DMSO
之去除效率之影響，並探討其反應速率常數與去除效率間之關係，做為實驗操作條件最適
化之依據。首先，在 PVA 電芬頓氧化部分，實驗結果顯示，其最適合之操作 pH、電流密
度及溫度分別為 pH 3、7.5 mA cm-2 及 303 K；在此操作條件下，其 PVA 去除率可達 90 
%以上，並由實驗數據求出 PVA 氧化之反應動力學，得知一級反應動力模式較適合描述整
個電芬頓之氧化程序；其次，在 DMSO 芬頓氧化部分，實驗結果顯示，其最適當之操作參
數，過氧化氫與亞鐵離子之比例、亞鐵離子濃度、起始 pH 值及溫度分別為 10、0.05 M、3、
298 K，在此操作條件下，其 DMSO 去除效率亦可達 90 %以上。最後，在 SA 電芬頓氧化
部分，實驗結果顯示，以過氧化氫產出量作為評估，其最適合之電極配位、電流密度、pH
及氧氣流速分別為活性碳布陰極、3.2 mA cm-2、3、500 ml min-1。

K, respectively. Under these conditions, the PVA concentration of PVA aquous solutions 
decreased by more than 90 %. A very good agreement with the experimental data was obtained 
the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, which best described the PVA removal by Electro-Fenton 
process. For treatment of DMSO by Fenton, we investigated the effects of different process 
parameters, such as the H2O2/Fe
2+
 molar ratio and ferrous ion concentration, initial pH values 
and temperature, on the degradation performance. The results indicated that the optimum ferrous 
ion concentration, initial pH, and temperature were 0.05 M, 3, and 298 K, respectively. Under 
these conditions, the DMSO concentration in DMSO aquous solutions decreased by more than 
90 %. For treatment of SA by Electro-Fenton, the optimum electrode pair, current density, 
solution pH, and oxygen saprging rate were found to be activated carbon fiber as cathode, 3.2

色製程目的在將碘離子擴散滲透進入聚乙烯醇膜內層，此製程產生之廢水含有大量
的碘分子、碘離子、硼酸、聚乙烯醇，其中聚乙烯醇不易被自然環境分解，需要很
長的時間才能將其氧化分解，因此，如何在廠內初期將聚乙烯醇自廢水中分離，減
少放流水對環境的負擔，是一個相當重要的研究重點。  
二、研究目的 
在光電面板產業中會使用大量有機物質，諸如：二甲基亞楓 (dimethyl sulfoxide, 
DMSO)、聚乙烯醇 ( polyvinyl alchohol, PVA)、乙醇胺 (monoethanolamine, MEA)、氫氧化
四甲基胺 (tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide, TMAH)等有機化合物，造成廢水中含氮磷與
高濃度有機物，其中含氮之有機物產生來自於 TMAH，有機硫的產生則來自於 DMSO，
若將這些高濃度有機廢水排放至水中，會使水中的藻類生長過快過多，導致水質優氧化、
溶氧降低，造成生態衝擊失去平衡。過去有學者利用高級氧化法配合活性污泥法降解
DMSO 之兩種方法：(1)利用過氧化氫、臭氧或是 UV/H2O2 將 DMSO 分解成二甲基楓 
(dimethyl sulfone, DMSO2, (CH3)2SO2)或甲基丙烯酸 (methansulfonic acid, (CH3)2SO3H)
後，再以活性污泥法降解 (Koito et al., 1998)。(2)以 Fenton 法作前處理，再配合活性污泥
法分解 DMSO (Park et al., 2001)。此兩種前處理皆需屬高成本之處理法，其價格並不便宜，
應用在 DMSO 的分解仍有待評估。再以 TMAH 來說，主要藉由生物連續氧化作用將四甲
基胺依序降解成三甲基胺、二甲基胺和甲基胺等 (黃淑君，2006)。生物處理法雖是目前
用於處理有機廢水最普遍方法之一，但 TFT-LCD 產業製程有機廢水都含有高強度之有機
氮與有機硫，在使用傳統的好氧活性污泥法處理時有其困難度，主要是因為這些成分的特
性不易被一般好氧微生物分解利用甚至對微生物有抑制性，而且處理時間很長，加上生物
程序系統常因廢水成分的異常變化，生物可分解性改變，以致脫硝作用與硝化作用效果不
佳，進而導致最終出流水殘留有機物之 COD 不符合放流水標準。而相較於生物處理方式，
物化處理所需時間短、受溫度變化影響小、較不受水質變動之限制，因此，物化處理較適
合用在處理含有難生物分解之有機物上。本研究之主要目的是開發一套新穎電化學技術 
(電混凝與電氧化技術)來處理高科技產業有機廢液中之有機物 (DMSO、PVA)，結合該兩
種電化學系統來去除光電面板產業製程中所排放之有機廢液 (如：DMSO、PVA 等)。因
此，本研究將分別以電混凝與電芬頓氧化技術開發具新穎之有機廢水物化處理方法之去除
程序，同時並探討其程序中之電能消耗與動力學機制，藉由程序中之電能消耗以評估最適
操作參數並運用動力學方法推導其反應機制，達成高科技產業有機廢液中之有機物的降解
或礦化。 
本研究計畫第一年是探討利用電混凝技術來處理高科技產業有機廢液中之有機物 
(DMSO、PVA)。本研究主要對於含聚乙烯醇  (PVA)、二甲基亞楓 (DMSO)及水楊酸 (SA)
之溶液做一系列電混凝實驗之探討，藉由，在不同操作參數之狀況下，針對 PVA、DMSO、
SA 等溶液中之濃度及 TOC 此兩種污染指標，來觀察電混凝技術對 PVA、DMSO、SA 之
去除效果，並藉由電混凝程序之電能消耗以評估最適之電混凝操作參數，以及探討電混
凝所產生之金屬氫氧化物吸附特性之研究，期望利用電混凝技術在這些有機廢水之
處理上，能達到最佳化之應用。  
本研究計畫第二年是探討利用電芬頓氧化技術來處理高科技產業有機廢液中之有機
物 (DMSO、PVA)。本研究主要對於含聚乙烯醇  (PVA)、二甲基亞楓 (DMSO)及水楊
2 
動力特性，得知其吸附動力學較傾向於二級反應，在等溫吸附模式中，以 Freundlich
模式較適合描述吸附聚乙烯醇之過程。  
3.2 二甲基亞楓特性簡介與廢水之處理 
二甲基亞楓 (Dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, (CH3)2SO)為一種具有 2 個 C-S 鍵分子結構的
有機硫化合物，對於熱與化學反應都相當穩定的有機溶劑，因其對於溶解有機與無機物質
有很強的能力 (Simo, R, 1998)，故被廣泛應用於電子、聚合物、染色與薄膜製造工業的製
程中 (Park et al., 2000)。在自然界中，Dimethysulfoxide (DMSO, (CH3)2SO)為地球上流循
環之中間產物 (Bentley et al., 1972)，主要是 dimethylsulfide (DMS, (CH3)2S)經氧化而生成
的，存在於海水上層 (Brimblecombe and Shooter, 1986)，或是大氣中 (Andreae, 1980)，
DMSO 扮演重要角色，當作氣候之氣膠及雲凝結核 (Charlson et al.,1987)，大自然界在海
水 DMSO 濃度 220nM 以上，湖泊、雨或河川濃度較低，約在 1~70nM 之間 (Andreae, 1980)。 
早期已有研究表示去除 DMSO 可分為兩種方式，其一為先將 DMSO 利用過氧化氫或
臭氧，進行氧化形成 Dimethylsulfone, (DMSO2, (CH3)2SO2)，再經活性污泥進行生物分解，
然而，因為臭氧價格昂貴，且必須控制 pH 及在生物分解前須去除剩餘過氧化氫，因此，
此技術尚有待評估；所以，Muratani 在 1999 年發展出利用生物程序處理 DMSO，如活性
污泥法 (Koito et al., 1998；Park et al., 2001)，在 15 鐘頭內可去除 600 mg/L 之 DMSO。 
3.3 水楊酸特性簡介與廢水之處理 
研究中所使用的有機汙染物為水楊酸 (Salicylic acid, SA)，水楊酸在醫療工業與染整
工業應用上範圍極廣。水楊酸外用對微生物有抗菌性，其防腐力近於酚，作為防腐劑則限
制使用。水楊酸的局部作用為角質溶解，作為角質軟化劑使用，可因製劑濃度不同而藥理
作用各異。1％-3％有角化促成和止癢作用；5％-10％具有角質溶解作用，可使角質層中
連接鱗細胞間粘合質溶解，從而使角質鬆開而脫屑，亦可產生抗真菌作用 (因去除角質層
後並抑制真菌生長，水楊酸能幫助其他抗真菌藥物的穿透，並抑制細菌生長）。25％濃度
具有腐蝕作用，可脫除肥厚的胼胝。適用於皮脂溢出，脂溢性皮炎，淺部真菌病，疣，雞
眼，胼胝及局部角質增生。另外，水楊酸同時也是染整工業上常見的化學藥品，能促使偶
氮類染料於基才上顯色，尤其是橘色與黃色染料。因此水楊酸廢水的主要來自於合成水楊
酸與水楊酸製備其他產物的工業廢水、製備藥物的工業廢水。每年在全世界被人類所使用
含有水楊酸藥品消耗數量達到成千上萬噸，而有關這類的廢水都在汙水處理廠被處理，但
因為處理效率低，近來被發現在地面甚至是飲用水裡都含有水楊酸 (每升有幾微克)，這
些含有水楊酸的汙染物可能因為其交互作用，影響了生態環境、影響魚類的內分泌系統、
其毒性也會影響藻類和無脊椎動物，導致產生多重耐藥菌株的微生物，它的芳香化合物也
具有很強的毒性，能刺激皮膚和粘膜並且與蛋白質反應之後會造成耳鳴、焦慮、暈船以及
電解質失衡等症狀，因此，在開發中的國家對於發展替代品來消除水楊酸及其代謝物的廢
水越來越有興趣，以避免其所造成人類及動物的潛在危害。 
近年來，有許多的科學研究對於水楊酸的去除已經被發表出來，而大部分的方法主要
為高級氧化處理程序，例如使用TiO2/UV或TiO2/UV系統的改質 (Chhor et al., 2004; Zahraa 
et al., 2006)、臭氧氧化 (Karpel et al., 1999)、H2O2/UV/oxygen 系統 (Scheck et al., 1995)、
利用 LaFeO3 濕式催化氧化 (Yang et al., 2007)、光芬頓 (Feng et al., 2004)等。然而，到目
4 
之關鍵，不外乎是消耗之電力及損耗之電極材料，其中，電混凝過程之鈍化層形成，
進流流速之控制，回流與否，添加氯化鈉以增加電極釋出效率等，對電能消耗皆會
帶來重大之影響。也透過實驗數據對電混凝程序做最適之成本估計。  
Szynkarczuk et al., (1994) 探討在處理 kaolinite 及 bentonite 懸浮液時影響混凝
速率的幾個有效因素，包括系統中之 NaCl 濃度、操作電壓與流體流動狀況。在電
混凝系統中是利用連續式的回流 EC (電混凝)設備作為 clay 的電混凝裝置，並分別
研究進流流速及回流與否，EC 操作時間、耗電量，對於濁度、沉降高度之影響。
同時，從實驗中發現 EC 功率增加  (消耗較多的能源)，離子釋出量增多，會使得濁
度下降，但是沉降高度上升，因為所形成之膠羽較鬆散，且含水量較多。較高之導
電度將會使溶液中的歐姆電位下降，也因此可以在相同之能源消耗下，獲得較高之
離子釋出量。  
Pout et al. (1995) 此研究利用電混凝程序結合後續之溶解空氣浮除法來處理都
市廢水，主要觀察之項目有 COD、SS、濁度，並分別比較單獨將兩程序分開以及
結合兩處理程序之效果，結果顯示出兩程序結合後有提升污染物之去除效用。此
外，作者也比較化學混凝方式和此結合式處理程序對於都市廢水之優勢。  
根據文獻中記載，電混凝的技術可以成功地應用在許多的污水處理技術方面，例如飲
用水處理、食品工廠廢水處理、釀酒發酵廢水、都市廢水、餐廳廢水、柏油砂礫、油頁岩
的廢水處理、含硝酸鹽的廢水處理、砷的廢水處理、重金屬廢水處理及紡織廢水處理等。 
3.5 電芬頓技術之理論與應用 
電芬頓技術主要利用傳統芬頓技術與電化學技術之優點相互結合而成，是利用電化學
技術產生的Fe2+和H2O2作為芬頓試劑之持續來源，兩者產生後立即作用而生成具有高度活
性之氫氧自由基 (OH·)，使有機污染物得以降解，其實質就是在電解過程中直接生成芬頓
試劑。與傳統芬頓技術相比，電芬頓技術有它獨特之優點： 
1. 不需或只需加入少量化學藥劑，可大幅降低處理成本 
2. 處理過程清潔，不會對水質產生二次污染 
3. 設備相對簡單，電解過程需控制之參數只有電流與電壓，易於實現自動控制 
4. 電芬頓技術中Fe2+和H2O2以相當之速率持續產生，起初有機污染物之降解速度較慢，
但能保持長時間持續有效之降解，有機物能得到更完全之氧化，且污泥量少，後續
處理簡單 
5. 有機物降解因素較多，除OH·之氧化作用外，還包括陽極氧化、電吸附等，因此處理
效率比傳統芬頓技術高 
6. 佔地面積小、處理週期短、條件要求簡單，易於和其他方法結合，便於廢水之綜合處
理 
電芬頓技術可依照Fe2+和H2O2產生方式之不同，分為下列五大類： 
1. 電芬頓-H2O2法 
6 
Fe
2+和H2O2分別由Fe3+與O2在陰極還原產生。通電時，O2在陰極得到兩個電子被還
原為H2O2，同時由外界加入之Fe3+也在陰極還原生成為Fe2+，Fe2+和H2O2組成便產生芬頓
試劑。由於電芬頓技術之研究始於20世纪80年代。因此，截至目前為止，國內外已有眾
多學者採用不同類型之電芬頓技術處理各種難降解有機廢水，取得了很好的效果。Oturan 
et al. (1999) 等利用電芬頓法對5種氯代苯氧型殺蟲劑之降解進行了研究，研究指出除草
劑首先被電生成的OH·逐步氫氧化，接着苯環被打開生成一些低毒的脂肪族化合物，證
明電芬頓法是一種去除殺蟲劑的有效方法。Guivarch et al. (2003) 等使用陰極產生Fe2+和
H2O2的方法處理了幾種偶氮染料，通過對降解產物之分析，提出了各種染料降解之動力
學及其機制。Edelahi et al. (2004) 等採用電芬頓法降解含達有龍 (一種劇毒性除草劑)之
廢水，其结果表明，0.17 mmol/L的達有龍在10 min内礦化程度達到93 %，其降解動力學
符合偽一級動力學。王永廣等人 (2002) 採用電解-芬頓法對氟磺胺草醚廢水之處理進行
了研究，反應5小時後，CODcr去除率達94 %以上，且產生的污泥量少。鄭曦等人 (2003) 
用陽極產生Fe2+和陰極產生H2O2的方法處理了含酸性鉻藍的染料廢水，脱色率達100%，
CODcr去除率達80 %。

C0為 PVA 起始濃度，Ct為隨著時間變化之濃度，V0為溶液之起始體積，Vt為隨著
時間變化之體積。  
以操作電 5V-20 V 之電混凝技術來處理 PVA 溶液，找出最合適之去除效率與
電能消耗，如圖 3-2 說明不同操作電壓對於 PVA 之去除效率與電能消耗之影響，
由圖中可看出當操作電壓從 5 V 增加至 10 V 時，PVA 之去除率由 46.1 % 增加至
77.1 %，而電能消耗只增加一些；然而，當電壓從 10 V 增加至 20 V 時，PVA 之去
除率僅從 71.1 % 增加至 95.5 %，但電能消耗卻由 15.7 kWh/kg 增加到 75.8 
kWh/kg。若將 PVA 去除效率與電能消耗一併列入考量時，對於本實驗來說 10 V 之
操作電壓有較適當的去除率以及較低的電能消耗。  
5.1.1.3 電解質濃度對 PVA 去除效率和電能消耗之評估 
當溶液中之導電度較低時，陽極和陰極之間會產生較高的歐姆電阻值，為了克
服溶液導電度較低的缺點，常見的方法就是添加少量的電解質來增加溶液的導電
度。  
可藉由添加適量之氯化鈉至 PVA 溶液中，如圖 3-3 所示，說明在電混凝期間
隨著不同電解質濃度對於 PVA 去除率及電能消耗之影響，圖中可看出 PVA 之去除
效率隨著電解質濃度增加而上升，當電解質濃度從 50 mg/L 增加至 100 mg/L 時，
電能消耗由 17.49 kWh/kg 小幅減少至 15.68 kWh/kg。當電解質濃度從 100 mg/L 增
加至 200 mg/L 和 300 mg/L 時，相對應之電能消耗從 15.68 kWh/kg 增加至 30.21 
kWh/kg 和 46.47 kWh/kg。把 PVA 之去除率及電能消耗一併列入考量時，對於本電
混凝實驗來說 100 mg/L 之電解質濃度有較適當的 PVA 去除率以及較低的電能消
耗。  
5.1.1.4 電極配位對於定電流系統之探討 
在電化學實驗中，電極材料是影響處理效果之重要因素，因此本研究中也將使
用鐵、鋁電極材料在四種不同的配位情形決定較適當的電極配位，而且鐵、鋁電極
是一種非毒性的材料。如圖 4-1 說明不同極板配位對於 PVA 去除效率之影響。從
圖中可以看出經過 120 分鐘的處理時間，Fe/Al 之電極配位有最高的去除效率，依
序是 Fe/Fe、Al/Al、Al/Fe 三種不同之電極配位，其中 PVA 之去除效率分別為 94.9 
%、68.7 %、47.3 %、30.1 %。以鐵作為犧牲陽極的效果會比鋁來的好的原因，是
由於鐵電極的電化學當量為 18.59 mmol/Ah，而鋁電極的電化學當量為 12.43 
mmol/Ah，當通過相同電荷時，對於鐵電極會產生較多的混凝劑；而陰極為鋁時的
去除效果會比鐵來得好的原因，則是鋁之氫氣過電壓比鐵來得小，容易產生更多氫
氣，進而發生浮除效果將污染物帶至溶液頂端，藉此提高去除效率。因此，在後續
實驗皆以 Fe/Al 的電極配位來操作。  
5.1.1.5 電流密度對溶液中 PVA 與 TOC 濃度去除率與電能消耗之影響 
在電混凝程序中，電流密度決定了混凝劑的劑量，因此電流密度成為電化學反
應中最重要的一個參數，而在本實驗中，將針對四種不同電流密度對於去除溶液中
16 
為了評估溫度對於 PVA 和 TOC 去除率與電能消耗之影響，將針對 PVA 溶液進
行一系列電混凝實驗，其中起始 PVA 濃度為 100 mg/L、0.008 N 之電解質濃度以及
5 mA/cm
2 之電流密度來處理，如圖 4-6 表示經過 100 分鐘之電解時間，不同溫度對
於 PVA 與 TOC 電能消耗之影響，由圖中可看出當溫度從 288 K 增加至 298 K 時，
PVA 和 TOC 之電能消耗皆減少了 50 %，若溫度超過 298 K 時，其電能消耗沒有明
顯的改善，PVA 之電能消耗僅從 8.16 kWh/kg 減少至 7.85 kWh/kg，而 TOC 之電能
消耗從 16.89 kWh/kg 減少至 15.59 kWh/kg。因此，把 PVA 與 TOC 之去除率及電能
消耗一併列入考量時，對於本實驗來說 298 K 之溫度有較適當的去除率以及較低的
電能消耗。  
5.1.1.7 溫度對於吸附熱力學之影響 
本電混凝實驗將改變不同溫度( 288 K 至 318 K ) 對於 PVA 溶液中 TOC 吸附效
率之影響，其中利用自由能( ∆G0 )、熱焓量( ∆H0 )、熵( ∆S0 )這些熱力學參數，可
用來確定整個電混凝程序吸附 TOC 之過程是為吸熱或放熱，亦確定是否為自發反
應，這些參數可由表 1 得知；從表中得知在任何溫度下 ∆G0 皆為負值，証明利用
Fe(OH)3 吸附 PVA 溶液中 TOC 之過程為一自發反應；而 ∆H0 為正，則說明此吸附
過程為吸熱反應；此外，∆S0 為正，在固液界面上能促使 Fe(OH)3 隨機吸附 PVA 溶
液中之 TOC。  
5.1.1.8 吸附動力學之探討 
在電混凝的過程中產生之金屬氫氧化物，其表面能有效的吸附污染物，而其反
應機制相當類似傳統之吸附，混凝劑能從廢水中吸引及吸收不同離子或膠體顆粒，
以達到吸附去除之效果。若犧牲陽極為鐵時，鐵離子會經過一連串的自發反應產生
氫氧化物或是氫氧化之聚合物，而三價鐵離子之產生通常是從亞鐵離子氧化而來，
氫氧根離子則是由陰極所產生，這些混凝顆粒之類型通常是以氫氧化鐵來吸附或是
共沉澱效應來去除溶液中之污染物。在本研究中，經由電混凝實驗前後，PVA 溶液
的 pH 值維持在 6.5~9.5 的範圍，其中在 pH6 至 pH10 這個範圍之間的優勢物種是
以 Fe(OH)3 的形式存在溶液中，因此，利用電混凝所產生之 Fe(OH)3 作為吸附劑來
吸附去除污染物。  
為了調查吸附 TOC 過程中之機制，我們分別用不同電流密度及溫度之吸附動
力學來探討，以一級及二級反應來描述 TOC 吸附至氫氧化鐵之吸附動力學，其吸
附速率常數可由表 2 及表 3 得知，同時由表中可知不論是電流密度或是溫度，皆是
一級反應的相關係數高於二級反應( R2 皆大於 0.997 以上)，因此，由表得知此電混
凝程序對於 TOC 之處理較適合以一級反應來描述。  
5.1.1.9 等溫吸附模式之探討 
在電混凝的程序中會產生大量的懸浮膠體，通常以 Fe(OH)3 的形式存在溶液
中，而這些膠體能有效的吸附去除污染物，進而產生沉澱的現象，為了調查整個吸
附機制之過程，必須建立適合之平衡曲線。在本實驗中，對於去除 PVA 溶液中之
18 
5.1.2.3 電解質濃度對 DMSO 去除效率和電能消耗之評估 
當溶液中之導電度較低時，陽極和陰極之間會產生較高的歐姆電阻值，為了克
服溶液導電度較低的缺點，常見的方法就是添加少量的電解質來增加溶液的導電
度。  
電解質濃度的調整可藉由添加適量之氯化鈉至 DMSO 溶液中，如圖 5-3 所示，說明
在電混凝期間隨著不同電解質濃度對於 TOC 去除率及電能消耗之影響，圖中可看出 TOC
之去除效率隨著電解質濃度增加而上升，當電解質濃度在 200 mg/L 增加至時有最高的去
除效率，再增加電解質濃度對於 TOC 去除率並無增加；當電解質濃度從 200 mg/L 增加至
300 mg/L 和 400 mg/L 時，相對應之電能消耗從 37.7 kWh/kg 增加至 43.3 kWh/kg 和 55.3 
kWh/kg。把 TOC 之去除率及電能消耗一併列入考量時，對於本電混凝實驗來說 200 mg/L
之電解質濃度有較適當的 TOC 去除率及較低的電能消耗。 
5.1.3 電混凝處理 SA部分之結果與討論 
此研究部分主要的處理方式為電混凝實驗處理，其中將 SA 溶液以定電壓之電
混凝系統來進行實驗，針對溶液中 SA 之去除效率進一步研究，並從能量消耗之觀
點尋求出最佳之操作條件與參數。  
每次實驗均會配置0.5 L含水楊酸之水溶液，磁石攪拌的速率設為300 rpm，不僅能使
整個溶液充分均勻混合，也可防止實驗過程中產生的絮狀物團聚在一起。連續通電120分
鐘，每10分鐘取樣一次，由於瓶中之懸浮顆粒無法立即沉澱，需靜藉由離心機將樣品離心，
因此後續實驗階經由離心程序後，才可量測水楊酸之濃度變化情形。

5.1.3.1電極配位對於定電壓系統之探討 
20 
電混凝技術已經發展超過 100 年，對於溫度的影響卻很少被拿來研究，本研究將溫度
設定在 288 K、298 K、308 K 及 318 K 來研究水楊酸在水溶液中去除情況，結果如圖 6-5
所示，經過 20 分鐘之電解時間，分別在 288 K、298 K、308 K 和 318 K 的溫度下，水楊
酸去除效率各別為 82.9 %、83.3 %、90.2 %、91.5 %；當溫度為 318 K、308 K、298 K 及
288 K 時，水楊酸達到 90 %之去除效果所用時間分別為 15 分鐘、16 分鐘、24 分鐘及 40
分鐘。若溶液溫度提高，可增加整個電化學反應速率增加，加速溶液中水楊酸分子之碰撞，
而且溶液溫度的提高會破壞陽極表面所產生之鈍化層。當溫度高於 308 K 時，水楊酸之去
除率僅增加一些，是由於溫度過高會使得沉澱物之溶解度提高，不容易產生絮狀物，因此
水楊酸之去除率並沒有明顯增加，根據圖中之結果，溫度控制在 298 K 至 318 K 之間，較
有利於本實驗。 
針對水楊酸之去除效率及能量消耗的評估以水楊酸去除率達到 90 %所需的時間來表
示，結果如圖 6-6 所示，當溫度從 288 K 增加到 308 K 時，水楊酸之電能消耗減少了約 50 
%，而水楊酸去除率達到 90%所需要的時間卻從 40 分鐘減少至 16 分鐘；然而，當溫度從
308 K 增加到 318 K 時，水楊酸之電能消耗從 3.8×103 kWh/kg 增加到 4.7×103 kWh/kg,，但
水楊酸去除率達到 90 %所需要的時間卻只減少了 1 分鐘。因此從水楊酸之去除率及能量
消耗來看，本研究最適之操作溫度為 308 K。 
5.1.3.5. 吸附動力學之探討 
在電混凝的過程中產生之金屬氫氧化物，其表面能有效的吸附污染物，而其反應機制
相當類似傳統之吸附，混凝劑能從廢水中吸引及吸收不同離子或膠體顆粒，以達到吸附去
除之效果。若犧牲陽極為鋁時，鋁離子會經過一連串的自發反應產生氫氧化物或是氫氧化
之聚合物，而三價鋁離子之產生通常是從二價鋁離子氧化而來，氫氧根離子則是由陰極所
產生，這些混凝顆粒之類型通常是以氫氧化鋁來吸附或是共沉澱效應來去除溶液中之污染
物。在本研究中，經由電混凝實驗前後，水楊酸溶液的 pH 值維持在 3.4~7.1 的範圍，其
中在 pH 4 至 pH 9 這個範圍之間的優勢物種是以 Al(OH)3 的形式存在溶液中，因此，利用
電混凝所產生之 Al(OH)3 作為吸附劑來吸附去除污染物。為了調查吸附水楊酸過程中之機
制，我們分別用不同電壓及溫度之吸附動力學來探討，以一級及二級反應來描述水楊酸吸
附至氫氧化鋁之吸附動力學，其吸附速率常數可由表 5 及表 6 得知，同時由表中可知不論
是電流密度或是溫度，皆是二級反應的相關係數高於一級反應( R2 皆大於 0.93 以上)，因
此，由表得知此電混凝程序對於水楊酸之處理較適合以二級反應來描述。 
22 
除率與電能消耗來做評估。 
其電流密度從 5 至 10 mA/cm2，如圖 7-3 所示，說明不同電流密度對於 PVA 之
去除效率，經過 60 分鐘的處理，PVA 之去除率為 79.1 %、93.8 %及 99.5 %，其電流密度
分別為 5、7.5 及 10 mA/cm2。當電流密度增加，PVA 去除率也隨之增加，其原因為提高
電流密度能同時提高陰極 H2O2 生成之速度與陽極 Fe2+之溶出量，進而加快氧化反應。 
針對 PVA 之去除率及電能消耗的評估，如圖 7-4 所示，電能消耗亦隨電流密度升高
而增加，當電流密度由 5 增加至 7.5 mA/cm2 時，PVA 去除率由 79.1 %增加至 93.8 %而電
能消耗也僅小幅增加；然而，電流密度從 7.5 增加至 10 mA/cm2 時，PVA 去除率僅從 93.8 
%增加至 99.5 %，但電能消耗卻從中增加了三倍。因此從 PVA 之去除率及電能消耗來看，
最適之電流密度為 7.5 mA/cm2。 
5.2.1.3 溫度對溶液中 PVA濃度去除效率及電能消耗之評估 
本實驗將以不同溫度 298、303、308、403 及 408 K 對溶液中之 PVA 去除率與電能
消耗來做評估，如圖 7-5 所示，經過 60 分鐘的處理，PVA 之去除率為 88.7 %、93.8 %、
95.1 %、90 %及 88.3 %，其操作溫度為 298、303、308、403 及 408 K，雖然一般來說溫
度的提高可促進氫氧自由基之生成，也可提高氫氧自由基之活性，更有利於氫氧自由基與
PVA 產生反應，但在過高的溫度條件下，H2O2 易被分解成 O2 和 H2O，而降低陰極 H2O2
之產量，從而影響電芬頓反應之效率。 
針對 PVA 之去除率及電能消耗的評估，如圖 7-6 所示，電能消耗並不會隨溫度升高
而明顯增加，當溫度由 298 增加至 303 K 時，PVA 去除率由 88.7 %增加至 93.8 %，電能
消耗減少了 45 %；然而，溫度 303 增加至 308 K 時，PVA 去除率沒有明顯改善，僅由 93.8 
%增加至 95.1 %，且電能消耗增加了 51 %。因此從 PVA 之去除率及電能消耗來看，最適
之操作溫度為 303 K。 
5.2.1.4 反應動力學之探討 
在本實驗中，為了調查 PVA 氧化程序之機制，將以一級與二級反應動力模式來探討
PVA 氧化之動力學。表 7 為不同電流密度與溫度對 PVA 去除之一級與二級動力學反應速
率常數及其相關係數，從表中皆可發現，在不同電流密度及溫度條件下，一級反應皆較適
合描述整個電芬頓對 PVA 處理之氧化程序。 
5.2.2 芬頓處理 DMSO部分之結果與討論 
此研究部分主要的處理方式為芬頓氧化實驗處理，實驗中所選擇之各種操作條
件，如過氧化氫與亞鐵離子的比例、亞鐵離子濃度、起始 pH 值及溫度等參數對於水溶液
中 DMSO 之去除效率之影響，並探討其反應速率常數與去除效率間之關係，做為實驗操
作條件最適化之依據。 
5.2.2.1 過氧化氫與亞鐵離子之比例效應 
在此系統中加入過氧化氫與亞鐵離子，兩者試劑即為著名的 Fenton 試劑，其氧化過
24 
0.1092，而繼續增加溫度到 318 K 時其 DMSO 去除效率為 92.6 %，反應速率常數為 0.0871。 
整體而言，去除效率並沒有太大之變化，當溫度高於 308 K 時，過氧化氫會受熱而分
解成水與氧氣，因此才會當溫度升高時去除率會有下降的趨勢。 
5.2.3 電芬頓處理 SA部分之結果與討論 
此研究部分主要的處理方式為電芬頓實驗處理，其中將 SA 溶液以定電壓之電
芬頓系統來進行實驗，針對溶液中 SA 之過氧化氫產出量進一步研究以尋求出最佳
之操作參數。  
5.2.3.1 電極配位對於電芬頓系統之探討 
在電化學程序中，電極材料在處理的效率上，具有很重要的影響，不同的電極配位是
控制電混凝過程中一個非常重要的因素，因此選擇適當的電極配位很重要；陽極的部分選
用不溶出的鈦金屬，由於鈦金屬在地殼含量中佔 0.63 %其含量與分佈極為廣泛，而電芬頓
需要藉由通電過程中通入氧氣促使陰極周圍產生雙氧水，藉由產生的雙氧水與外加的亞鐵
離子作用形成電芬頓反應，因此陰極的材料必須要對於氧氣的還原產生過氧化氫有良好的
產量，因此在陰極部分選用碳材 (石墨與活性碳布)，最後再決定出最適當的電極配位。
為了研究在不同電極配位組合對於電混凝處理水楊酸的去除效果，使用 3.2 mA/cm 之電流
密度以及在水楊酸水溶液中加入 0.05 M 之電解質 (Na2SO4)，如圖 9-1 所示，對於石墨板
及活性碳布兩種不同極板配位之去除效果，由圖可以明顯看出使用活性碳布所產生的雙氧
水明顯比使用石墨板所產生的雙氧水來的更多，這是由於在同樣的材料下，活性碳布的反
應面積比石墨板的反應面積來的更多。因此以去除效果的觀點考量，在本研究中把活性碳
布視為最適當的陰極電極。 
5.2.3.2. 不同電流密度對於過氧化氫產出量之影響 
電芬頓程序主要結合了直接電解氧化法與芬頓程序的反應機制，為了提高整個系統的
反應性，氧氣以外加的方式注入在陰極上進行還原反應以產生過氧化氫，為了找出過氧化
氫產出量最大的情況，本實驗以不同操作電流密度 0.8 mA/cm2、1.6mA/cm2、3.2 mA/cm2
和 6.4 mA/cm2 對含水楊酸之模擬廢液通電過程中過氧化氫產出效率來做評估，結果如圖
9-2 所示，經過 90 分鐘的處理，過氧化氫之產出量為 1.26 ppm、10.17 ppm、21.17 ppm 和
12.45 ppm，其電流密度分別為 0.8 mA/cm2、1.6 mA/cm2、3.2 mA/cm2 和 6.4 mA/cm2，當
電流密度增加，過氧化氫之產出量也隨之增加，其原因可能為當通入的電流密度加大時，
陰極活性碳布所產生的氫氧根離子也隨著增加，使得溶液中有更多的氫氧根離子能夠跟通
入的氧氣反應形成更多的過氧化氫，但是當提供的電流密度過大，過氧化氫的生成率反而
會下降，如圖三所示，當電流密度從 3.2 mA/cm2 增加到 6.4 mA/cm2時過氧化氫生成率不
但沒有隨著增加，反而從 21.17 ppm 下降到 12.45 ppm，其可能的原因是因為當施加的電
場過大，反而會使過氧化氫被電解掉，而導致過氧化氫濃度降低。 
5.2.3.3. 不同 pH對於過氧化氫產出量之影響 
26 
六、結論 
本研究主要對於含 PVA、DMSO 及 SA 之溶液分為電混凝與電芬頓兩大部分進
行實驗探討，因此，在本成果報告最後之結論中將其分為兩大部分作介紹；第一部
分是以電混凝系統處理不同有機物  (PVA、DMSO 及 SA)所獲得之結論；第二部分則
是以電芬頓系統處理不同之有機物  (PVA、DMSO 及 SA)所獲得之結論。本成果報告
之結論如下： 
6.1 第一年計畫成果之結論 
PVA 部分： 
1. 對於 Fe/Al、Fe/Fe、Al/Al 及 Al-Fe 四種不同極板配位，以去除效率的觀點考量，
在本研究中以 Fe/Al 為最適當之電極配位組合。  
2. 從去除率及電能消耗之考量，100 mg/L 之 NaCl 是最適合的電解質濃度。  
3. 同時考量較低的電能消耗及去除率這兩項因素，對於去除溶液中之 PVA 來說，
10 V 之操作電壓為較適當之操作參數。  
4. 在電流密度與溫度之操作參數中，利用電混凝系統來去除溶液中之 PVA 與 TOC
有顯著之效果，且較適之電流密度與溫度分別為 5 mA/cm2 及 298 K。  
5. 在吸附熱力學方面，在任何溫度下之 ∆G0 皆為負值，証明利用氫氧化鐵吸附 PVA
溶液中 TOC 之過程為一自發反應；而 ∆H0 為正，說明此吸附過程為吸熱反應，
此外，∆S0 為正，氫氧化鐵能在固液界面上隨機吸附 PVA 溶液中之 TOC。  
6. 在電混凝過程中會大量產生金屬氫氧化物來吸附去除溶液中之 TOC，以等溫吸
附模式來探討其吸附過程，由實驗結果得知，以 Freundlich 之吸附模式之相關
係數高於 Langmuir 模式，因此可推論對此程序來說以 Freundlich 之等溫吸附模
式較適合描述。  
7. 探討以氫氧化鐵吸附去除 TOC 之動力模式，在不同電流密度和溫度下，其中以
一級動力反應模式，較適合描述以氫氧化鐵吸附溶液中 TOC 之動力機制。  
DMSO 部分： 
1. 對於 Al/Al、Fe/Al、Al-Fe 及 Fe/Fe 四種不同極板配位，以去除效率的觀點考量，
在本研究中以 Al/Al 為最適當之電極配位組合。  
2. 從去除率及電能消耗之考量，200 mg/L 之 NaCl 是最適合的電解質濃度。  
3. 同時考量較低的電能消耗及去除率這兩項因素，對於去除溶液中之 DMSO 來
說，20 V 之操作電壓為較適當之操作參數。  
SA 部分： 
1. 對於 Fe/Fe 及 Al/Al 兩種不同極板配位，以去除效率的觀點考量，在本研究中以 Al/Al
為最適當之電極配位組合。 
2. 同時考量較低的電能消耗及去除率這兩項因素，對於去除溶液中之水楊酸來說，20 V
之操作電壓及 308 K 之操作溫度，是較適當之操作參數。

This study investigates the feasibility of removing the chemical
oxygen demand (COD) from a solution containing polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) by electrocoagulation. Several parameters—including the
current density, supporting electrolyte, and temperature—were
evaluated in terms of COD removal efﬁciency. The effects of these
parameters on the electrical energy consumption were also investi-
gated. The optimum current density, supporting electrolyte concen-
tration, and temperature were found to be 5mA/cm2, 0.012N NaCl,
and 298K, respectively. The experimental data were also tested
against different adsorption isotherm models to describe the electro-
coagulation process; the COD adsorption studied here best ﬁt the
Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters,
including the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, indicated
that the adsorption of COD on metal hydroxides was feasible,
spontaneous, and endothermic in the temperature range of 288K
to 318K.

INTRODUCTION
In general, textile wastewater contains a number of
different kinds of pollutants such as dyes, salts, oxidizing
agents, and sizing agents. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a
well-known recalcitrant pollutant and is commonly used
in the textile industry as a sizing agent (1). PVA is also used
as an ophthalmic lubricant in the pharmaceutical industry
for products such as adhesives, emulsion paints, paper
coatings, and detergent-based materials. The large amount
of PVA discharged from industrial efﬂuents is harmful to
humans and the environment (2). Besides the high chemical
oxygen demand (COD) of wastewaters containing PVA, it
can create additional environmental issues due to its ability
to mobilize heavy metals from sediments in lakes and water
streams (3). Conventional biological technologies do not
effectively break down PVA, which is well-known as the
main contributor of COD in textile wastewater, because
the PVA-degrading capacity of most microorganisms is
extremely restricted and speciﬁc (4). Even though COD is
not a speciﬁc compound, it is considered as an indicator
of the degree of pollution in the wastewater discharge.
The formation of foam in biological equipment used for
PVA wastewater treatment makes it difﬁcult to achieve
stable operation and achieving acceptable results very
difﬁcult (5). Conventional treatment technologies do not
satisfactorily reduce PVA and COD concentrations in
wastewaters. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the
development of new method for reducing the COD from
solution containing PVA.
There have been many studies on the degradation of
PVA; most of these reports focus on photochemically
initiated degradation processes (6–8). Other physico-
chemical studies related to the degradation of PVA employ
methods such as ultrasonic techniques (9), direct oxidation
by KMnO4 (10), radiation-induced degradation (11),
adsorption by various materials, and the use of extraction
resins (12–14). However, there is little research on the
development of an electrochemical treatment for the
removal of PVA.
In recent years, electrochemical technology has been uti-
lized in various ways to clean the environment (15), and
there has been increasing interest in the use of electrochem-
istry for environmental applications. Environmental
electrochemistry (16–18) involves electrochemical techni-
ques that remove impurities from gases, liquids, and soil
to prevent environmental pollution. Electrochemical coa-
gulation is the electrochemical production of destabiliza-
tion agents that neutralize charges for pollutant removal;
this technique has been used previously for wastewater
treatment. Electrocoagulation (EC) is an electrolytic
process that generates metallic hydroxide ﬂocks in situ via

where COD0 is the initial concentration in mg=L, CODt is
the concentration value at time t in mg=L, V0 is the initial
volume of the treated wastewater in liters, and Vt is the
volume of the treated wastewater at time t in liters. All of
the samples were measured in duplicate to ensure data
reproducibility, and an additional measurement was
carried out if necessary.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Current Density
The current density strongly affects the performance of
EC in electrochemical processes (16). The effect of the
current density on the COD removal rate for the PVA solu-
tion was studied at 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 7.5mA=cm2. Figure 1
indicates the effect of the current density on the COD
abatement rate for the PVA solution in normalized form
for various electrolysis durations. As the duration of the
electrolysis treatment increased, comparable increases to
the COD abatement rate were observed for all current den-
sities. As shown in Fig. 1, after 60min of electrolysis,
45.2%, 62.4%, 78.7%, and 80.8% of the original COD
was removed for current densities of 1.25, 2.5, 5, and
7.5mA=cm2, respectively. As the current density increased,
the COD removal rate increased, which was probably
because the organic compounds present in the solution
containing PVA were mostly removed when they reacted
with the iron ions to form insoluble compounds. Further-
more, as the applied current density increased, the
generation rates of metal hydroxides increased and, in turn,
led to an increased COD removal rate. The required
treatment times to remove over 60% of the COD were
26, 28, 56, and 98min for current densities of 7.5, 5, 2.5
and 1.25mA=cm2, respectively. The results indicate that
the current density determined the coagulant dosage rate.
As the current density increased, the required time for
the EC process decreased. If there was a sufﬁcient current
level of current passing through the solution, the metal ions
generated by the dissolution of the sacriﬁcial electrode were
hydrolyzed to form a series of metal hydroxides. These
metal hydroxides neutralized the electrostatic charges on
the dispersed particles, thereby reducing the electrostatic
interparticle repulsion so that the van der Waal’s attraction
dominated and facilitated agglomeration (30). It took a
longer time (about 98min) to reach over 60% COD
removal for the solutions subject to a current density of
1.25mA=cm2. This is because a current density of
1.25mA=cm2 was insufﬁcient to completely destabilize
the suspended metal hydroxides in the solution. As time
progressed and the amount of dissolved iron hydroxides
increased, there was an increase in COD removal efﬁciency;
this result can be explained by noting the amount of COD
adsorption in aqueous solution containing PVA increases
the adsorbent concentration (i.e., iron hydroxides), so the
adsorption depends on the availability of binding sites for
COD in an aqueous solution containing PVA. However,
no signiﬁcant improvement in the COD removal efﬁciency
for any duration of electrolysis was observed when the
current density was increased from 5 to 7.5mA=cm2. To
investigate the optimum current density, the performance
of the electric energy consumption at a certain current
density during EC was evaluated; these results are given
in the following section.
Effect of Current Density on the Removal Efficiency
and Electrical Energy Consumption
The electrical energy consumption required to achieve
the desired degree of treatment, rather than the highest
removal efﬁciency, determines the feasibility of a proposed
treatment approach. Once the required currents and corre-
sponding voltages were obtained from the EC experimental
tests, the amount of energy used was estimated. We consid-
ered the initial and ﬁnal concentrations of COD in the
solution containing PVA at different times. The electrical
energy consumption (EEC) (kWh=kg) was calculated as
a function of time for the removal of 1 kg COD from an
aqueous solution containing PVA using EC with constant
applied current using the following equation:

signiﬁcant improvement in the COD removal efﬁciency was
observed when the concentration of the supporting electro-
lyte was above 0.012N. After 60min of electrolysis, when
the concentration of the supporting electrolyte was
increased from 0.012 to 0.016N, the original COD of
solution containing PVA was removed slightly from
78.7% to 81.4%.
Effect of the Supporting Electrolyte on the Removal
Efficiency and Electrical Energy Consumption
The concentration of the supporting electrolyte was
adjusted by adding a suitable amount of NaCl to the
solution. Figure 4 indicates the effect of the supporting
electrolyte on the COD removal efﬁciency of a solution
containing PVA and electrical energy consumption during
an EC process. Increasing the concentration of the
supporting electrolyte from 0.004 to 0.016N increased
the COD removal efﬁciency from 62.7% to 80.2%, whereas
the electrical energy consumption was signiﬁcantly
decreased by almost 80%. The reason for this observation
could be that the cell voltage decreased as the solution
conductivity increased at a constant current density. When
the solution conductivity increased, the voltage necessary
to attain a certain current density was diminished, and
consequently the amount of electrical energy required
decreased. However, there was no signiﬁcant improvement
in the COD removal efﬁciency after 60min of electrolysis
when the concentration of the supporting electrolyte was
above 0.012N. When the concentration of the supporting
electrolyte was increased from 0.012 to 0.016N, the COD
removal efﬁciency increased slightly from 78.7% to
81.4%, while the corresponding electrical energy consump-
tion remained steady. Consequently, 0.012N NaCl pro-
vided the optimum balance between the COD removal
efﬁciency for the solution containing PVA at the electrical
energy consumption.
Effect of Temperature
The effect of temperature on EC has rarely been investi-
gated even though the EC technology has been around for
over 100 years. In this study, the effect of temperature on
the COD abatement rate of aqueous solution containing
PVA was studied at 288, 298, 308, and 318K, as shown
in Fig. 5. As the electrolysis time increased, comparable
increases in the COD abatement rate were observed for
the different temperatures. After 60min of electrolysis,
58.5%, 78.7%, 81.8%, and 83.4% of the original COD
was removed for the temperatures 288, 298, 308, and
318K, respectively. The treatment time required to reach
60% COD removal was approximately 23, 26, 28, and
66min for the temperatures 318, 308, 298, and 288K,
respectively. Thus, the electrochemical reaction rate, like
other chemical reaction rates, increased when the solution
temperature increased. The increase to the COD removal
rate for increased temperatures can be attributed to the
increased destruction of the passivation ﬁlm on the anode
surface and increased rates for all of the reactions involved
in the process, according to the Arrehenius equation (16).
Also, the increased temperature promoted the generation
of metal hydroxides formed in the EC process, which led
to greater mobility and more frequent collisions with metal
hydroxides species, resulting in an increased reaction rate
between the metal hydroxides (i.e., iron hydroxides) and
pollutants by adsorption (32). However, there was no sig-
niﬁcant improvement to the COD removal efﬁciency for
the solution containing PVA after 60min of electrolysis
when the solution temperature was above 298K, as shown
in Fig. 5. This result can be explained by the opposing
effects associated with higher temperatures, such as an

where aL (mg=g) is a constant related to the area occupied
by a monolayer of adsorbate, reﬂecting the maximum
adsorption capacity; Ce(mg=L) is the equilibrium
liquid-phase concentration; KL (L=mg) is a direct measure
of the intensity of adsorption; and qe (mg=g) is the amount
adsorbed at equilibrium. From the data of 1=qe versus 1=Ce,
KL and aL can be determined from the slope and intercept.
The Freundlich adsorption isotherm usually ﬁts experi-
mental data for a wide range of concentrations. This
empirical model includes the surface heterogeneity and
exponential distribution of the active sites and their ener-
gies. The isotherm is adopted to describe reversible adsorp-
tion and is not restricted to monolayer formation. The
mathematical expression for the Freundlich mode is (36)
qe ¼ KfC1=ne ð5Þ
where Kf ((mg=g)(L=mg)
1=n) and n (dimensionless) are con-
stants that account for all factors affecting the adsorption
process, such as the adsorption capacity and intensity. The
Freundlich constants Kf and 1=n are determined from the
intercept and slope, respectively, of the linear plot of ln qe
versus lnCe. The applicability of the isotherm equations
was compared using the correlation coefﬁcient (R2) in this
study. The constants of the Langmuir and Freundlich iso-
therms are presented in Table 1. The values of the correla-
tion coefﬁcient (R2) are found to be greater than 0.9 for
both isotherms. However, it can be seen that the Freundlich
isotherm model yields a better ﬁt than the Langmuir iso-
therm model for the COD adsorption onto iron hydroxides
for a solution containing PVA. The variable Kf in the
Freundlich equation is related to the adsorption capacity
of the adsorbent and n gives the extent of the deviation from
linearity of the adsorption. When the value of n is equal to
unity the adsorption sites have the same energy and no inter-
action occurs between the adsorbed species. If n< 1 the
adsorption process is largely physical. By contrast, if n> 1
the adsorption process is chemical (37). Since the value of
n at equilibrium was 0.95 (less than unity) at 298K in the
present study, physical adsorption was dominant for the
removal of COD from an aqueous solution containing PVA.
Adsorption Thermodynamics
Thermodynamic parameters, including Gibbs free
energy change (4Go), enthalpy change (DHo), and entropy
change (DSo), were used to determine whether or not the
adsorption process was spontaneous. The values of DGo
were calculated using the following equation:
DGo ¼ RT ln Kd ð6Þ
where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J=mol=K), T is
the temperature (K), and Kd is the distribution coefﬁcient.
The Kd value was calculated using following equation (38):
Kd ¼ qe
Ce
ð7Þ
where qe and Ce are the equilibrium concentrations of
COD for the amount adsorbed per unit mass (mg=g) and
in the solution (mg=L), respectively. The relationship
between DGo, DHo, and DSo can be expressed by the
following equation:
DGo ¼ DHo  TDSo ð8Þ
This equation can be written as:
lnKd ¼ DS
o
R
 DH
o
RT
ð9Þ
The effect of temperature on the adsorption efﬁciency of
the COD for aqueous solution containing PVA was evalu-
ated at different temperatures in the range from 288K to
318K. At different temperatures, the corresponding Ce
values for different ﬁxed values of qe were calculated. The
thermodynamic parameters DHo and DSo were calculated
from the slope and intercept, respectively, of the plot of
lnKd versus 1=T, while the Gibbs free energies were calcu-
lated from Eq. (6). The values of DGo, DHo, and DSo are
given in Table 2. At all temperatures DGo was negative,
indicating the feasibility of the process and spontaneous
nature of the adsorption of COD on iron hydroxides.
The increase in the absolute magnitude of DGo with
increasing temperatures indicated that these processes were
favored at high temperatures. The positive value of DHo
indicated that the adsorption process is endothermic. In
addition, the positive value of DSo suggested that the
increased randomness at the solid-solution interface during
the adsorption of COD on iron hydroxides in an aqueous
solution containing PVA. While the adsorption process
was endothermic, under these conditions the process
became spontaneous owing to the positive entropy change.

electrochemically generated metallic ions can be hydrolyzed next
to the anode and generate a series ofmetal hydroxides that are able
to destabilize the dispersed particles present in the wastewater to
be treated. The destabilized particles are believed to be responsi-
ble for the aggregation and precipitation of the suspended particles
and for the adsorption of the dissolved pollutants. The pollutants
can then be removed by sedimentation and turned into slurry. This
technique also presents several beneﬁts compared to conventional
methods: higher energy efﬁciency, easy operations, simple equip-
ment, less sludge production, and no requirements for the use of
chemicals. EC is an efﬁcient method for the treatment of drinking
water [24], metal laden wastewater [25], restaurant wastewater
[26], colored water [27], chemical mechanical polishing wastewa-
ter [28–30], and wastewater containing phosphates [31], ﬂuoride
[32], arsenic [33], and indium [34,35]. To our knowledge, the effects
of the EC parameters on the removal of PVA in aqueous solutions
have not been studied to date.
The electrochemical removal of PVA under various parameters
such as the current density, supporting electrolyte, temperature,
and initial concentration are investigated in this study. In general,
an effective process must be economically advantageous regarding
the electrical energy consumption (EEC), and it must be applicable
to many environmental problems. The effects of various oper-
ational parameters (current density, supporting electrolyte, and
temperature) on EEC using optimum conditions were evaluated.
The adsorption kinetics of the electro-coagulants was analyzed
using pseudo-ﬁrst- and second-order kinetic models. The equi-
librium adsorption behavior was analyzed and compared to the
model predictions of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The
effect of temperature on the adsorption isothermswas determined,
and the thermodynamic parameters during the adsorption such as
the free energy, enthalpy and entropy were calculated for various
temperatures.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and apparatus
The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, with a molecular weight in the
range of 13,000–23,000gmol−1)was obtained fromSigma–Aldrich
(Saint Louis, MO 63103, USA) with a hydrolysis degree ranging
from 98 to 99%. An aqueous solution containing polyvinyl alcohol
was prepared in deionized water at 363K under stirring. The con-
centration of the supporting electrolyte was adjusted by adding
NaCl (Tedia Company, USA). Iodine (I) was obtained from Toyobo
Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and potassium iodide (KI) was purchased
from Union Chemical Work Ltd. (Hsin-Chu, Taiwan). The boric acid
(H3BO3) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All of
the chemicals used in this work were reagent grade. The chemical
reagents were prepared by dilution with deionized water to obtain
the desired concentrations. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the
experimental apparatus and the electrode assembly for the elec-
trocoagulation system used in this work. The electrolytic cell with
an inner radius of 5 cm and a depth of 24 cm had a volume of about
2.0 L and was a Pyrex glass reactor equipped with a water jacket
and a magnetic stirrer. The electrolytic cell was thermostated by
means of its water jacket using a refrigerated water bath circulator
(Model BL-720, Taiwan). A magnetic stirrer bar (Suntex, SH-301,
Taiwan) was spun at the center of the bottom of the reactor. Cast
iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) plates (12 cm×6 cm×0.2 cm) were
used for the fourdifferent combinationsof anodeandcathodepairs.
The electrode pairwas dipped into an aqueous solution of polyvinyl
alcohol at a depth of 6.5 cm, and the two electrodes were approxi-
mately2 cmapart. Theeffective areaof the immersedelectrodepair
was 40 cm2. The assembly was connected to a direct current power

source (2400 Series Sourcemeter, Cleveland, OH, USA). Thus, the EC
cell can be operated in a galvanostatic mode with a constant cur-
rent supply and a maximum source power of 22W. The polyvinyl
alcohol aqueous solutions were characterized using a pH meter
(Sartorius, Professional Meter PP-20, Germany) and by measuring
their conductivity (Euteoh, CyberScan 510, Singapore).
2.2. Experimental procedure and analysis
Before each experiment, the electrodes were polished with
sandpaper to remove the scale build-upand thendipped in a3NHCl
solution at a depth of 8 cm for 10min. Finally, they were cleaned
with deionized water. During each test run, a circular container
with 1 L of aqueous PVA solution was used as the reactor. The mag-
netic stirrer was turned on and set at 300 rpm; this stirrer speed
was fast enough to provide a good mixing in the electrolytic cell
and slow enough at the same time to prevent the breakup of the
ﬂocks formed during the treatment process. A ﬁxed amount of
NaCl was added to the aqueous solution to increase the solution
conductivity and thus facilitate the EC process. A constant temper-
aturewasmaintained by circulating refrigeratedwater through the
water jacket. Each EC test lasted 120min for all experiments. After
EC, particulates of colloidal ferric hydroxide were produced, which
led to the yellow-brown color of the aqueous solution. The sam-
ples were periodically taken from the reactor and allowed to settle
down for 6h in a 15mL Pyrex glass column. After the EC treatment,
the conductivity and pH of the polyvinyl alcohol aqueous solutions
were measured with a multi-meter and a pH meter, respectively.
The PVA concentration in the aqueous solutions was determined
using a HACH Model DR2800 spectrophotometer (HACH Company,
USA) after addition of boric acid and iodine solutions according
to the procedure described by Finley [36]. A calibration curve was
obtained by plotting the absorbance value at 680nm as a function
of the polyvinyl alcohol concentration. The PVA removal efﬁciency
after EC was calculated according to:
RE (%) = C0V0 − CtVt
C0V0
× 100, (1)
where C0 is the initial concentration in mgL−1, Ct is the concen-
tration at time t in mgL−1, V0 is the initial volume of the treated
wastewater in L, and Vt is the volume of the treated wastewater at
time t in L.

are obtained fromECexperiments, the amount of consumedenergy
can be estimated. In the case of EC with a constant applied cur-
rent, the EEC (kWhm−3) was calculated as a function of time for
the removal of 1m3 of aqueous solution containing PVA using the
following equation:
EEC = I
∫
U dt
V × 60
(4)
where U, I, and t are, respectively, the applied voltage (V), cur-
rent (A), and electrolysis time (min), and V is the volume in m3 of
the treated aqueous solution containing PVA. Reasonable removal
efﬁciency and relatively low EC are determined below.
After 120min of electrolysis, the PVA solutions were treated by
EC at current densities in the range of 1.25–7.5mAcm−2 in order
to determine the optimum removal efﬁciency and EEC. The effects
of the current density on the removal efﬁciency and on the energy
consumption are shown in Fig. 4. The results show that an increase
in the current density from 1.25 to 7.5mAcm−2 led to a signiﬁ-
cant increase from 71.2% to 93.4% in the PVA removal efﬁciency.
When the current density was increased from 1.25 to 5mAcm−2,
the PVA removal efﬁciency strongly increased from 71.2% to 92.1%,
whereas the corresponding EEC only increased slightly. However,
when the current density was increased from 5 to 7.5mAcm−2, the
PVA removal efﬁciency was slightly improved from 92.1% to 93.4%,
whereas the corresponding EEC signiﬁcantly increased from 0.079
to 0.211kWhm−3. Consequently, a current density of 5mAcm−2
provides the optimum performance for the present study and
results in reasonably good removal efﬁciency and relatively low
EEC.
3.3. Effect of the supporting electrolyte concentration
The solution conductivity increases with increasing support-
ing electrolyte concentrations, so that the current passing through
the circuit increases for the potentiostatic mode [40]. Any electro-
chemical treatment requires the presence of salts as a supporting
electrolyte to make the solution more conductive. In the present
study, NaCl was used as a supporting electrolyte to increase the
solution conductivity and thus reduce the EEC. The effect of various
supporting electrolyte concentrations on the PVA removal efﬁ-
ciency is shown in Fig. 5. A signiﬁcant increase in the PVA removal
efﬁciency was observed with increasing electrolysis times, regard-
less of the supporting electrolyte concentration. This strongly
suggests that the presence of the supporting electrolyte improves
the PVA removal efﬁciency. As the concentration of the support-
ing electrolyte was increased, the PVA removal efﬁciency was
improved.After 120minof electrolysis andwhen the concentration
of the supporting electrolyte was increased from 0.004 to 0.008,
Fig. 5. Effect of the supportingelectrolyte concentrationon the removal efﬁciencyof
PVA (PVA=100mgL−1, current density =5mAcm−2, t=120min, T=298K, d=2 cm,
agitation speed=300 rpm).
0.012, and 0.016N, the removal efﬁciency increased from 85.1% to
91.1%, 92.1%, and 94.1%, respectively. This is most certainly due to
the Cl− anions that destroy the passivation layer of the electrode
and catalyze its dissolution material through a pitting corrosion
phenomenon,which is a typeof localizedcorrosioncausedbyahigh
chloride concentration in the solution [40]. Therefore, we thought
that the EC in the presence of NaCl could improve the PVA removal
efﬁciency by increasing the availability of metal coagulants in the
solution and by leading to a reduction of the oxide layer and an
enhancement of the anodic dissolution of the electrode material.
Consequently, the problem of electrode passivation was partially
solved when NaCl was used as a supporting electrolyte. The treat-
ment times required to reach a PVA removal efﬁciency of 80% were
approximately 42, 50, 60, and 80min for 0.016, 0.012, 0.008, and
0.004N, respectively. However, no signiﬁcant improvement in the
PVA removal efﬁciency was observed after 120min of electrolysis
when the supporting electrolyte concentration was above 0.008N.
3.3.1. Effect of the supporting electrolyte on removal efﬁciency
and electrical energy consumption
The supporting electrolyte concentration was adjusted by
adding a suitable amount of NaCl to the solution. Fig. 6 shows the
effect of the supporting electrolyte on the removal efﬁciency and
the EEC during the EC. As shown in the ﬁgure, the PVA removal
efﬁciency increased from 85.1% to 94.1% after 120min of electrol-
ysis, whereas the supporting electrolyte concentration increased
from 0.004 to 0.016N and the corresponding EEC was considerably

3.6. Adsorption kinetics
Metal hydroxides that are formed during the EC process pos-
sess a very high afﬁnity for adsorption. Coagulated particles attract
and absorb different ions and colloidal particles from the wastew-
ater. If iron electrodes are used, the generated Fe ions immediately
undergo further spontaneous reactions to produce corresponding
hydroxides and/or polyhydroxides. Ferric ions are commonly gen-
erated by oxidizing ferrous ions produced at the anode during the
dissolution of iron, while OH− ions are generated at the cathode.
Mixing the solution produces hydroxide species, which remove
pollutants by adsorption and co-precipitation. In the present study,
the pH values of aqueous solutions containing PVA were in the
range 6.5–9.5 during the EC process, which indicates that Fe(OH)3
is the dominant metal hydroxide functioning as an adsorbent [43].
The amount of PVA adsorbed by the Fe(OH)3 was calculated from
the difference between the PVA quantity added to the Fe(OH)3 and
the PVA content of the precipitation using the following equation:
qe = V(C0 − Ce)
M
(5)
where qe is the PVA uptake (mgg−1), C0 and Ce are, respectively,
the initial and ﬁnal (or equilibrium) concentrations in the solution
(mgL−1), V is the volume of the solution (L) and M is the mass of
Fe(OH)3 (s). In addition, qe was calculated on the basis of assum-
ing that the current efﬁciency of the electrochemical cell is unity.
In order to investigate the mechanisms of the PVA adsorption pro-
cess, two different kinetic models, namely, the pseudo-ﬁrst-order
model and pseudo-second-order model were applied to describe
the kinetics of the PVA adsorption onto iron hydroxides. The best-
ﬁtmodelwas selectedaccording to the linear regression correlation
coefﬁcient values, R2.
3.6.1. Pseudo-ﬁrst-order model
Theﬁrst-order rate equationof the Lagergrenmodel is oneof the
most widely used expression describing the adsorption of solute
from a solution [44]. The pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation is given by
dqt
dt
= k1(qe − qt) (6)
where qe (mgg−1) and qt (mgg−1) are the amounts of PVA adsorbed
on the adsorbent at equilibrium and at any time t, respectively, and
k1 (min−1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-ﬁrst-order model.
After integration of Eq. (6) and after applying the boundary condi-
tions qt =0 at t=0 and qt =qt at t= t, we obtain:
ln(qe − qt) = ln qe − k1t (7)
The pseudo-ﬁrst-order model considers that the rate of occu-
pation of the adsorption sites is proportional to the number of
unoccupied sites. The values of k1 and qe can be obtained from
the slope and intercept of the linear plot of ln(qe −qt) versus t,
respectively. The adsorption rate constants determined from the
pseudo-ﬁrst-order model are listed in Table 1. We observed that
the correlation coefﬁcients for the ﬁrst-order kinetic model were
relatively lower than those obtained for the second-order kinetic
model for various initial concentrations.
3.6.2. Pseudo-second-order model
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model is based on the adsorp-
tion equilibrium capacity and can be written as [45]:
dq
dt
= k2(qe − qt)2 (8)
where k2 (gmg−1 min−1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-second-
order equation, qe (mgg−1) is the maximum adsorption capacity,
and qt (mgg−1) is the amount of adsorption at time t (min). After
integration and after applying the boundary conditions qt =0 at t=0
and qt =qt at t= t, Eq. (8) becomes:
t
qt
= 1
k2q2e
+ t
qe
(9)
If second-order kinetics is applicable, plotting t/qt as a function
of t results in a straight line, and qe and k2 can be obtained from
its slope and intercept, respectively. The adsorption rate constants
determined from the pseudo-second-order model are also listed in
Table 1.
As discussed above, the validity of the model of Lagergren
and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model can be identiﬁed for
each linear plot. The value of the correlation coefﬁcient R2 for the
pseudo-second-order model was greater than 0.991 for all the ini-
tial concentrations. The large correlation coefﬁcients (R2 >0.991 in
all initial concentrations) and the adsorption capacities calculated
from the model are also close to those determined experimentally.
These results indicate that the second-order kinetic model can be
applied topredict the PVAadsorptionprocess onto ironhydroxides.
3.7. Adsorption isotherms
The formed Fe(OH)n(s) (where n=2 or 3) complexes remain
in the aqueous stream as a gelatinous suspension. These gelati-
nous charged hydroxyl cationic complexes can effectively remove
pollutants by adsorption and produce charge neutralization by

H◦ indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic. In addi-
tion, the positive value of S◦ suggests the random character of
the PVA adsorption on iron hydroxides at the solid–solution inter-
face. Even if the adsorption process were endothermic, the process
would be spontaneous because of the positive entropy change.
4. Conclusion
EC is an appropriate remediation process for treating aqueous
solutions containing PVA. Various operatingparameters such as the
electrode pairs, the current density, the supporting electrolyte, and
the temperature were investigated in this study. The PVA removal
efﬁciencies were approximately 94.9%, 68.7%, 47.3%, and 30.1% for
Fe/Al, Fe/Fe, Al/Al, and Al/Fe electrode pairs, respectively. The Fe/Al
electrode pair constitutes the best choice of electrode out of the
four combinations tested in this study. Considering the removal
efﬁciency and EEC, a supporting electrolyte of 0.008N NaCl, a cur-
rent density of 5mAcm−2, and a solution temperature of 298K
were found be the optimum values for the present study. Increas-
ing the initial PVA concentration from 50 to 150mgL−1 led to a
decrease in the PVA removal efﬁciency. A pseudo-ﬁrst-ordermodel
and pseudo-second-order model were used to ﬁt the adsorption
kinetics. A very good agreement with the experimental data was
obtained for the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which best
described the PVA adsorption onto iron hydroxides. The gelatinous
charged metal hydroxides generated during the EC can efﬁciently
remove the PVA by adsorption. The EC was modeled using adsorp-
tion isotherm models. The adsorption of PVA was best ﬁtted by the
Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which suggests monolayer cover-
ageof theadsorbedmolecules. Various thermodynamicparameters
(G◦,H◦ andS◦) were also determined, and their values indi-
cate that the adsorption process was favorable, spontaneous, and
endothermic in nature. As the temperature increased from 288 to
318K, G◦ became less negative, resulting in an enhanced adsorp-
tion capacity at high temperatures. The positive value of H◦
conﬁrmedtheendothermicnatureof theprocess,whichmeans that
the reaction consumed energy. The positive value of S◦ indicated
the random nature of the PVA adsorption onto iron hydroxides
fromaqueous solutions.Under these conditions, themaximumPVA
removal efﬁciency was found to be 95%.

The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) from aqueous solution containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using
iron electrocoagulation (EC) was investigated. Iron hydroxides generated during EC were used to remove
PVA and TOC from the aqueous solution, and the effects of varying current density and solution temperature
on PVA and TOC adsorption characteristics were evaluated. The ﬁndings indicated that complete PVA
removal accompanied by TOC removal of an aqueous PVA solution could be achieved within a reasonable
electrolysis time and with relatively low electrical energy consumption. A pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic model
provided a good ﬁt to the experimental results at various current densities and solution temperatures. In
addition, the experimental data were ﬁtted with several adsorption isotherm models to describe the EC
process. The predictions of the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model satisfactorily matched the
experimental observations. Thermodynamic parameters, including the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and
entropy, indicated that the TOC adsorption of the aqueous solution containing PVA on metal hydroxides was
feasible, spontaneous and endothermic in the temperature range of 288 K to 318 K.

1. Introduction
Textile wastewater generally contains a number of different kinds
of contaminants such as dyes, salts, oxidizing agents, and sizing
agents. Among these, a particularly recalcitrant contaminant is
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a well-known water-soluble polymer that
is widely used in warp-sizing agents, paper-coating agents, emulsion
paints, adhesives, and detergent-based industries [1]. The release of
PVA from industrial plants, especially in wastewater efﬂuents
discharged from desizing processes in the textile industry, causes
many ecological problems that must be solved [2]. These highly
contaminated wastewaters contain considerable amounts of dis-
solved organic carbon, causing a high chemical oxygen demand (COD)
[3]. However, total organic carbon (TOC) is a more convenient and
direct expression of total organic content than COD. Measurement of
TOC provides a rapid and accurate method of determining the degree
of organic contamination, as the amount of carbon in wastewater is an
indicator of the organic character of the efﬂuent. The greater the
carbon or organic content, the more oxygen is consumed [4]. PVA is
also used as an ophthalmic lubricant in the pharmaceutical industries.
The global production of PVA is estimated to be nearly 650,000 tons/
year. It is difﬁcult to convert wastewater containing PVA into harmless
end products such as water and carbon dioxide; thus, PVA adversely
affects the ecosystem and can accumulate in the human body via the
food chain [5]. Furthermore, PVA also creates environmental issues
due to its ability to mobilize heavymetals from sediments in lakes and
water streams [6]. Conventional biological treatment technologies do
not effectively break down PVA because the degrading capacity of
most microorganisms for PVA is extremely restricted and speciﬁc [7].
Therefore, a method for the removal of PVA from wastewater, either
by chemical transformations, which may also lead to a substantially
decreased TOC, must be found.
A considerable amount of scientiﬁc work on the degradation of
PVA has been carried out, most of which has focused on photochem-
ically initiated degradation processes [2,8–10]. Other physio-chemical
studies related to the degradation of PVA have used methods such as
ultrasonic techniques [11], direct oxidation by KMnO4 [12], radiation-
induced degradation [13], adsorption by various materials, and
extraction with resins [14–17]. However, to date, there is little
research on the development of an electrochemical treatment for the
removal of PVA.
Electrochemical technologies have been utilized in various ways
for environmental remediation [18,19], and there has been increasing
interest in the use of electrochemistry for environmental applications.
Thesemethods can prevent pollution problems arising from industrial
efﬂuents, and they are attractive technologies because of their
versatility and environmental suitability; their main reagent, the
electron, is a clean one [19–21]. Electrocoagulation (EC) is an
electrolytic process that generates metallic hydroxide ﬂocs in situ
via electro-dissolution of a soluble sacriﬁcial anode immersed in

EC procedure, the sacriﬁcial iron anode is oxidized to polymeric ionic
species. With progressive electrolysis, the ionic strength of the
solution increases. Ionic polymeric iron species can neutralize the
surface charge of PVA molecules. These species neutralized the
electrostatic charges on the colloidal PVA species to reduce an
electrostatic interparticle repulsion sufﬁcient for the van der Waals
attraction to predominate, thus facilitating agglomeration [37]. In
addition, the dissolved organic compounds can be removed by surface
complexation or electrostatic attraction. For instance, in electrostatic
attraction, the polymeric iron complexes can have both positive and
negative charge capable of attracting the opposite charge of polluting
species and remove them from solution. Therefore, as the applied
current density was increased, the generation rates of iron hydroxides
increased, and this in turn led to an increased PVA and TOC removal
rate. However, no signiﬁcant improvement in the PVA and TOC
removal efﬁciency was observed when the current density was
increased from 5 to 7.5 mA cm−2. To investigate the optimum current
density, the performance of the electric energy consumption at a
certain current density during EC was evaluated; these results are
given in the following section.
3.1.1. Effect of current density on electrical energy consumption
To determine the best current density, the performance with
respect to the electrical energy consumption (EEC) at each given
current density during EC was evaluated. The EEC required achieving
the desired degree of treatment, rather than the highest removal
efﬁciency, determines the feasibility of the proposed treatment
approach. Considering the initial and ﬁnal concentrations of com-
pounds in the PVA solution at different times, the EEC was calculated
as the amount of electrical energy consumed per kg of compound
removed during EC (i.e., kWh kg−1 PVA or TOC) [27,33]. After the
required currents and corresponding voltages were obtained from the
EC experiments, the amount of electrical energy used was estimated.
Fig. 3 shows the EEC values calculated on the basis of the PVA and
TOC removal efﬁciencies for 100 min of electrolysis at different
applied current densities. From Fig. 3, it is apparent that increasing
current density had a signiﬁcant effect on EEC; an increase in the
current density from 1.25 to 7.5 mA cm−2 led to a dramatic increase
in the EEC values for PVA removal, from 0.86 kWh kg−1 to
22.03 kWh kg−1, whereas the corresponding EEC values for TOC
removal increased from 1.96 kWh kg−1 to 49.12 kWh kg−1. The
ﬁgure also indicates that EEC values for TOC removal were higher
than for PVA removal, since the simple removal of PVA from aqueous
solution is achieved more readily ultimate TOC removal. When the
current density was increased from 2.5 to 5 mA cm−2, the EEC values
for both PVA and TOC removal increased only slightly. However, when
the current density was increased from 5 to 7.5 mA cm−2, the EEC
values for both PVA and TOC removal increased appreciably, by almost
a factor of three. Consequently, upon consideration of removal
efﬁciency and EEC values for both PVA and TOC, a current density of
5 mA cm−2 provided the best performance for the present EC andwas
chosen as the best current density for the following EC experiments.
Fig. 4 shows the effect of electrolysis time on the removal efﬁciency of
PVA and TOC at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. As the duration of the
electrolysis treatment increased, comparable increases in the removal
efﬁciency were observed for both PVA and TOC. The treatment times
required to achieve over 80% removal were 30 and 50 min for PVA and
TOC, respectively. However, the removal efﬁciencies of PVA and TOC
reached a plateau and remained steady when the electrolysis time
was above 60 min. In the following sections, all EC experiments were
conducted using 60 min of electrolysis.
3.2. Effect of temperature on PVA removal
In this study, the effect of the temperature on PVA and TOC
removal efﬁciency was studied at 288, 298, 308, and 318 K, as shown
in Fig. 5. After 60 min of electrolysis, we observed that the PVA
removal efﬁciencies reached 82.8%, 92.8%, 93.5%, and 93.8% for
temperatures of 288, 298, 308, and 318 K, respectively; the
corresponding TOC removal efﬁciencies were 72.1%, 84.8%, 88.4%,
and 88.6%, respectively. Thus, the electrochemical reaction rate, as
with other chemical reaction rates, increased with increasing solution
temperature. The temperature inﬂuence can be attributed to an
improved destruction of the iron oxide ﬁlm on the anode surface and
an increase in the rate of all reactions involved in the process
according to the Arrhenius equation [20]. Also, the increased
temperature promoted the generation of iron hydroxides formed in
the EC process, which led to a greater concentration and thus more
frequent collisions of PVA and iron hydroxides, resulting in an
increased reaction rate of pollutant adsorption [38]. However, no

nature of the adsorption of TOC on iron hydroxides. The increase in the
absolute magnitude of ΔG° with increasing temperature indicates that
theseprocesseswere favored athigh temperatures. Thepositive valueof
ΔH° indicates that the adsorption processwas endothermic. In addition,
the positive value of ΔS° suggests increased randomness at the solid–
solution interface during the TOC adsorption of PVA from solution onto
iron hydroxides. While the adsorption process was endothermic under
these conditions, the process was spontaneous due to the positive
entropy change.
3.3. Adsorption kinetic modeling
A pollutant is generally adsorbed at the surface of the metal
hydroxides generated during the EC process. Thus, the removal of a
pollutant is similar to conventional adsorption, except that the
coagulants are generated. Coagulated particles attract and absorb
different ions and colloidal particles from the wastewater. If iron
electrodes are used, the generated ferric ions or ferrous ions
immediately undergo further spontaneous reactions to produce
corresponding hydroxides and/or polyhydroxides. Ferric ions are
commonly generated by the oxidation of ferrous ions produced at the
anode during the dissolution of iron, while OH− ions are generated at
the cathode. Mixing the solution produces iron hydroxide species,
which remove pollutants by adsorption and co-precipitation. Fe(OH)3
is the dominant species in the range from pH 6 to pH 10, according to
predominance-zone diagrams for Fe(III) chemical species in aqueous
solution [42]. In the present study, the pH values of the PVA solutions
were in the range of 6.5 to 9.5 during the EC process, which indicates
that Fe(OH)3 was the dominant metal hydroxide functioning as an
adsorbent. The electrode consumption can be estimated according to
Faraday's law, and the amount of metal hydroxides generated can be
stoichiometrically determined. Since the amount of coagulant can be
estimated for a given time, and the metal hydroxides formed during
EC possess adsorption abilities, the pollutant removal can be modeled
as an adsorption phenomenon. In order to investigate the mechan-
isms of the TOC adsorption process, two different kinetic models, a
pseudo-ﬁrst-order model and a pseudo-second-order model, were
applied to describe the kinetics of the TOC adsorption onto iron
hydroxides. The best-ﬁtting model was selected according to the
linear regression correlation coefﬁcient value, R2.
3.3.1. Pseudo-ﬁrst-order model
The ﬁrst-order rate equation of the Lagergren model is one of the
most widely used expressions for describing the adsorption of a solute
from a solution [43]. The pseudo-ﬁrst-order equation is given by:
dqt
dt
= k1 qe−qtð Þ ð6Þ
where qe (mg g−1) and qt (mg g−1) are the amounts (here, of PVA or
TOC) adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium and at any time t,
respectively, and k1 (min−1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-ﬁrst-
order model. After integration of Eq. (6) and applying the boundary
conditions qt=0 at t=0 and qt=qt at t= t, we obtain:
ln qe−qtð Þ = ln qe−k1t: ð7Þ
The pseudo-ﬁrst-order model considers the rate of occupation of
the adsorption sites as proportional to the number of unoccupied
sites. The values of k1 and qe can be obtained from the slope and
intercept, respectively, of a linear plot of ln(qe−qt) versus t. Fig. 7(a)
and (b) shows the kinetics of TOC removal in PVA aqueous solution as
the pseudo-ﬁrst-order model ﬁtting for various current densities and
temperatures, respectively. The adsorption rate constants determined
from the pseudo-ﬁrst-order model for various current densities and
temperatures are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. We observed
that the correlation coefﬁcients for the ﬁrst-order kinetic model were
relatively higher than those obtained for the second-order kinetic
model for the different current densities and temperatures. This
indicates that the pseudo-ﬁrst-order kinetic model might be sufﬁcient
to describe the mechanism of TOC adsorption onto iron hydroxides.
3.3.2. Pseudo-second-order model
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model is based on the adsorption
equilibrium capacity and can be written as [44]:
dqt
dt
= k2 qe−qtð Þ2 ð8Þ
where k2 (g mg−1 min−1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-second-
order equation, qe (mg g−1) is the maximum adsorption capacity, and
qt (mg g−1) is the amount of adsorption at time t (min).

(mg g−1) is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium. From a plot of 1/qe
versus 1/Ce, KL and aL can be determined from the slope and intercept
of the resulting straight line. Fig. 9 shows the linearized Langmuir
absorption isotherm plot with experimental data.
3.4.2. Freundlich isotherm
The Freundlich adsorption isotherm typically ﬁts experimental
data over a wide range of concentrations. This empirical model
includes considerations of surface heterogeneity and exponential
distribution of the active sites and their energies. The isotherm is
adopted to describe reversible adsorption and is not restricted to
monolayer formation. The mathematical expression for the Freun-
dlich mode is [46]:
qe = KfC
1=n
e ð11Þ
where Kf ((mg g−1)(L mg−1)1/n) and n (dimensionless) are constants
that account for all factors affecting the adsorption process, such as
the adsorption capacity and intensity. The Freundlich constants Kf and
1/n are determined from the intercept and slope, respectively, of the
linear plot of ln qe versus ln Ce. Fig. 10 shows the linearized Freundlich
absorption isotherm plot with experimental data.
The applicability of the two isotherm equations was compared
using the correlation coefﬁcient (R2). The Langmuir and Freundlich
constants for the adsorption of TOC onto iron hydroxides are
presented in Table 4. Based on the R2 values, the Freundlich isotherm
model provided a better ﬁt to the experimental data (R2=0.98) for
the TOC adsorption. The variable Kf in the Freundlich equation is
related to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent, and n gives the
extent of the deviation from linearity of the adsorption. When the
value of n is equal to unity, the adsorption sites have equal energy, and
no interaction occurs between the adsorbed species. If nb1, the
adsorption process is largely physical. If nN1, the adsorption process is
chemical [47]. Since the value of n at equilibriumwas 1.186 at 298 K in
this study, chemical adsorption was dominant.
4. Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that EC is a promising treatment
for the removal of PVA and associated TOC from aqueous solution. The
experiments showed the feasibility of removing PVA and TOC by
adsorption and co-precipitation with iron hydroxides. The following
conclusions were drawn based on the presented information:
(1) The PVA and TOC removal efﬁciencies were signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the current density and temperature in the
present EC study.
(2) The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS°) were also
determined. Their values indicated that the adsorption process
was favorable, spontaneous, and endothermic in nature. As the
temperature increased from 288 K to 318 K, ΔG° became less
negative, indicating a stronger driving force, resulting in a
greater adsorption capacity at higher temperatures. The
positive value of ΔH° conﬁrmed that the process was
endothermic, meaning that the reaction consumed energy.
The positive value of ΔS° suggested that the increased
randomness at the solid-solution interface occurred during
the TOC adsorption from the aqueous solution containing PVA
onto iron hydroxides.
(3) The pseudo-ﬁrst-order model and pseudo-second-order model
were applied to identify the kinetics of TOC adsorption onto
iron hydroxides. The kinetic results showed that the TOC
adsorption of the aqueous solution containing PVA on iron
hydroxides was best described using the pseudo-ﬁrst-order
kinetic model at the various current densities and tempera-
tures studied.
(4) The gelatinous and charged metal hydroxides generated by EC
can efﬁciently remove TOC by adsorption, and the EC process
was modeled using adsorption isotherm models. The TOC
adsorption was best ﬁt by the Freundlich adsorption isotherm,
and the results were in good agreement with the experimental
data.

Abstract
The feasibility of salicylic acid removal from an aqueous solution was investigated in an electrochemical cell
equipped with either aluminum or iron plates by using electrocoagulation (EC). Several parameters, including
electrode materials, solution pH variation, applied voltage, and solution temperature, were investigated. In
addition, the effects of applied voltage and solution temperature on the electric energy consumption and the time
needed to reach 90% removal were investigated. Experimental results indicated that the Al/Al electrode pair was
the most efficient choice of the two electrode pairs tested in terms of salicylic acid removal efficiency. In terms of
the pH variation during EC, the generation of coagulant metal hydroxides for the Al/Al electrode pair was greater
than that for the Fe/Fe electrode pair, which also enhanced the removal efficiency. The optimum applied voltage
and solution temperature were found to be 20 V and 308 K, respectively. A pseudo-second-order kinetic model
provided a good fit to the experimental results at various applied voltages and solution temperatures. In addition,
the activation energy was calculated as 20.21 J mole1 based on pseudo-second-order rate constants from the
Arrhenius equation, indicating that salicylic acid precipitation in an aqueous solution was attributable to the EC
process.

Introduction
Thousands of tons of pharmaceutical drugs are con-sumed yearly in human and veterinary medicine
worldwide. Due to the inefficient destruction of these waste-
waters in sewage treatment plants, these compounds have
been recently detected in surface, ground, and even drinking
waters in concentrations up to several micrograms per liter
(Nakada et al., 2006). The possible interactions of these pol-
lutants with living beings in the environment indicate that
some drugs can affect the endocrine system of fishes, have
toxic effects on algae and invertebrates, and promote the
development of multi-resistant strains of microorganisms
(Balcioglu and O¨tker, 2003). Salicylic acid, also known as
2-hydroxybenzoic acid, is easily produced from hydrolytic
deacetylation of the common drug acetylsalicylic acid (aspi-
rin) (Andreozzi et al., 2003). Its aromatic organic compound is
very toxic, and it can stimulate skin and mucous membranes,
react with protein, and cause tinnitus, qualm, naupathia, and
electrolytic turbulence (Chen et al., 2010). Salicylic acid has
been identified as a water pollutant that originates from the
manufacturing activities of paper milling, cosmetic indus-
tries, pharmaceutical formulations, and as a landfill leachate.
It is most heavily detected in sewage treatment plant effluents
and natural waters. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effi-
cacious alternatives for the removal of salicylic acid and its
metabolites fromwastewaters to avoid their potential adverse
health effects on animals and humans.
A considerable number of scientific studies on the removal
of salicylic acid have been performed. Most of these studies
have focused on advanced oxidation processes, initiated
degradation processes, such as photocatalysis with TiO2/UV
ormodified TiO2/UV systems (Chhor et al., 2004; Zahraa et al.,
2006), ozonation (Karpel Vel Leitner et al., 1999), H2O2/UV/
oxygen systems (Scheck and Frimmel, 1995), catalytic wet air
oxidation with LaFeO3 (Yang et al., 2007), and photo-assisted
Fenton using Fe ions on an acidic ion exchange resin (Feng
et al., 2004). However, to date, there is little research on the
development of a simple electrochemical treatment for the
removal of salicylic acid.
Electrochemical technologies have been utilized in vari-
ous ways for environmental remediation (Brillas et al., 2003).
These methods can prevent pollution problems from indus-
trial effluents due to their versatility and environmental
suitability; their main reagent, the electron, is a clean reagent

Procedure and analysis
Before each experiment, the electrodes were polished with
sandpaper to remove the scale build-up, then dipped in a 3N
HCl solution at a depth of 5.5 cm for 10min, and then finally
cleaned with successive rinses of deionized water (Chou,
2010). During each test run, 0.5 L of aqueous solution con-
taining salicylic acid was placed into the reactor. Then, the
magnetic stirrer was turned on and set at 300 rpm; this stirrer
speed was sufficient for good mixing in the electrolytic cell
and was sufficiently low so as to not disrupt the flocks formed
during the treatment process. A fixed amount of NaCl
(100mg L1) was added to the aqueous solution to increase
the solution conductivity and facilitate the EC process. The
direct current power source was operated at a constant ap-
plied voltage of 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 V. A constant temperature
(288 to 318 K) was maintained by circulating refrigerated
water through the water jacket. EC test runs lasted no
>120min in all experiments. At the end of EC, all samples
were centrifuged (Hsiangtal; Beginner’s Economy Cen-
trifuges) in a 15-mL centrifuge tube (set at 4,000 rpm for 1 h).
After the EC treatment, the conductivity and pH of the
salicylic acid aqueous solution were measured with a multi-
meter and a pH meter, respectively. The salicylic acid con-
centration in the aqueous solutions was determined using a
NEWLAB UV-7504 PC. A calibration curve was obtained by
plotting the absorbance value at 297 nm as a function of the
salicylic acid concentration. The salicylic acid removal effi-
ciency after EC was calculated according to the following
equation:
RE (%)¼ C0V0CtVt
C0V0
· 100 (1)
where C0 is the initial concentration in mg L
1; Ct is the con-
centration at time t in mg L1; V0 is the initial volume of the
treated wastewater in liters; and Vt is the volume of the
treated wastewater at time t in liters. All experiments were
repeated five times to ensure the reproducibility of the data.
The statistic standard deviation and coefficient of variation
were 0.0117 and 1.358104, respectively.
Results and Discussion
Comparison of electrode material
In any electrochemical process, the electrode materials and
the type of electrode pair are regarded as significant factors
affecting the performance of the EC process (Mollah et al.,
2001). Both Fe and Al plates are cheap, readily available, and
proved effective. The results obtained for the removal effi-
ciency of salicylic acid for these two kinds of electrodes using
the same applied voltage are shown inF2c Fig. 2. The removal
efficiency of salicylic acid for both electrodes increased
whereas the duration of the electrolysis treatment increased.
As seen in this figure, the salicylic acid removal increased to
92% for the Al/Al electrode pair after 20min and increased to
68% for the Fe/Fe electrode pair after 80min. Further, the EC
of metal hydroxides had no positive effect on salicylic acid
removal above 20 and 80min for the Al/Al and Fe/Fe elec-
trode pairs, respectively. Nevertheless, with increasing time,
the rates of salicylic acid removal obtained with the Al/Al
electrode pair were relatively higher than the rate with the
Fe/Fe electrode pair. In addition, there was a clean and col-
orless effluent when using the Al electrode in the EC process,
whereas the Fe electrode resulted in a blurry and more turbid
effluent. b F3Figure 3 demonstrates the photograph result of color
comparison in the presence of different electrode materials.
Some studies (Chen et al., 2000; Kobya et al., 2006) that in-
vestigated the pollutant removal of wastewaters by EC re-
ported that a relatively stable and clean solution could result
from using an Al electrode in the process. It is obvious that
aluminum is a better electrode material than iron for the
present study. To explain the reason for the better perfor-
mance when using Al anodes, the effect of the pH variation
during EC was investigated in the following section. In ad-
dition, all subsequent EC experiments were performed using
the Al/Al electrode combination.
Effect of the pH variation during EC
When dissolved in water, the salicylic acid solution has a
pH at equilibrium from 3.2 to 3.5. b F4Figure 4 shows the effect of
the operating time on the pHvariation at an applied voltage of
30 V during the EC process. Initially, the solution pH in-
creased at a high rate, and then the rate fell regardless of the
electrode pair used (Al/Al or Fe/Fe). The treatment induced
an increase in pH during the EC process, which could be
interpreted in terms of the excess hydroxyl ions produced at
the cathode under acidic conditions. These observations also
implied that the cathodic water reduction and the chemical
dissolution of the aluminum or iron electrodes increased the
pH value. In the case of the aluminum electrode, the pH value
increased rapidly between 0 and 20min, increasing from 3.4
to 7.1; however, there was no significant variation in pH after
20min of electrolysis. The effect of pH variation on the EC
process was explained as follows: the dominant aluminum
species present in the aqueous solution were different ac-
cording to the solution pH; Al3þ and Al(OH)2þ ions were
dominant in the acidic pH range 2–3; and in a pH range of 4–9,
the Al3þ and OH ions generated by the electrodes reacted
to form various polymeric species, such as Al7(OH)17
4þ,
Al13O4(OH)24
7þ were finally transformed into insoluble

REMOVAL OF SALICYLIC ACID VIA EC 3
EES-2010-0262-Chou_1P.3D 12/28/10 6:40pm Page 3
With sufficient current flowing through the solution, the
metal ions generated by the dissolution of the sacrificial
electrode (aluminum or iron) were hydrolyzed to form a se-
ries of aluminum hydroxides or iron hydroxides (Linares-
Herna´ndez et al., 2009). The treatment times required to reach
90% salicylic acid removal were 18, 20, 24, 38, and 50min for
applied voltages of 30, 25, 20, 15, and 10 V, respectively. As
the applied voltage increased, the required time for the EC
process decreased. A sufficient level of voltage through the
solution caused the metal ions generated by the dissolution of
the sacrificial electrode to hydrolyze, forming a series of metal
hydroxides. These metal hydroxides neutralized the electro-
static charges on the dispersed particles, thereby reducing the
electrostatic interparticle repulsion so that the van der Waals
attraction dominated and facilitated agglomeration (Mollah
et al., 2001). However, no significant improvement in removal
efficiency was observed when the applied voltage was in-
creased from 20 to 30 V. To investigate the optimum applied
voltage, the performance of the electric energy consumption
at a certain applied voltage during EC was evaluated as de-
scribed in the following section.
Effect of applied voltage on electric
energy consumption
The electrical energy consumption of wastewater treat-
ment was evaluated to determine whether EC is economi-
cally viable for salicylic acid removal from aqueous solution.
Once the required voltages and the corresponding currents
were obtained from the EC experimental tests, the amount of
energy consumed was estimated. The electric energy con-
sumption function was calculated based on per-kg salicylic
acid removal during EC (kWh kg1) at a constant voltage,
using the following equation:
EEC¼
R
I ·Udt
(C0V0CtVt)· 216 ¼
U
R
Idt
(C0V0CtVt)· 216 (2)
where U, I, and t are the applied voltage (V), current (A), and
electrolysis time (min), respectively. In addition, C0 is the
initial concentration in milligrams per liter; Ct is the concen-
tration value at time t in milligrams per liter; Vo is the initial
volume of the treated wastewater in liters; and Vt is the vol-
ume of the treated wastewater at time t in liters. A reasonable
time to reach 90% removal and relatively low energy con-
sumption was determined below.
Salicylic acid solutions were treated using aluminum EC at
applied voltages in the range of 5 to 30 V to determine the time
to reach 90% removal and electric energy consumption. The
results are shown inF6c Fig. 6 Here, we see that an increase in the
applied voltage from 10 to 30 V led to a dramatic increase in
the electric energy consumption, from 2.2 to 8.8 kWh kg1.
When the applied voltage increased from 10 to 20 V, the
electric energy consumption increased by a factor of two,
whereas the time to reach 90% removal decreased by al-
most 50% simultaneously. However,when the applied voltage
increased from 20 to 30 V, the electric energy consumption
significantly increased by almost 200%, whereas the corre-
sponding time to reach 90% removal slightly decreased by
25%. Consequently, considering both the electric energy con-
sumption and the time to reach 90% removal, an applied
voltage of 20 V provided the optimum performance for the
present study and resulted in a reasonable time to reach 90%
removal with relatively low electric energy consumption.
Effect of temperature
In the present study, the effect of the temperature on the
salicylic acid removal efficiency was studied at 288, 298, 308,
and 318 K, as shown in b F7Fig. 7. As the electrolysis time in-
creased, comparable increases in the salicylic acid removal
efficiency were observed for the different temperatures. After
20min of electrolysis, we observed that the salicylic acid re-
moval efficiency reached 82.9%, 88.3%, 90.2%, and 91.5% for
temperature of 288, 298, 308, and 318 K, respectively. The
treatment times required to reach 90% removal of the salicylic
acid were 15, 16, 24, and 40min for temperatures of 318,
308, 298, and 288 K, respectively. Thus, the electrochemical

relation values (R2). As shown in Table 1, regardless of the
applied voltage, the R2 value for the pseudo-second-order
model was relatively higher than that for the pseudo-first-
order model. As shown in Table 2, regardless of the solution
temperature, the correlation value (R2) for the pseudo-second-
order model was relatively higher than that for the pseudo-
first-order model. This result suggests that the salicylic acid
removal from aqueous solution by EC follows a pseudo-
second-order kinetic model at various applied voltages and
solution temperatures.
The rate of a reaction depends on temperature. To under-
stand the relationship between temperature and the reaction
rate, we assume that the rate constant depends on the tem-
perature of the reaction. The pseudo-second-order rate con-
stant is expressed by the Arrhenius equation.
k¼A exp Ea
RT
 
(5)
where A is the proportionality constant of the reaction; Ea is
the activation energy ( J mole1); R is the gas constant (8.314 J
mol1 K1); and T is the temperature (K). The Arrhenius
equation can be used to determine the activation energy of a
reaction. We start by taking the natural logarithm of both
sides of Equation (5):
ln k¼ ln A Ea
RT
(6)
According to this Equation (6), a plot of ln k vs. 1/T should
produce a straight line with a slope of - Ea/R. An activation
energy of 20.21 J mole1 was calculated using the slope of the
fitted equation (least-squares correlation coefficient¼ 0.979).
Conclusion
This study indicated that EC is a promising treatment for
the removal of salicylic acid from aqueous solutions and
showed the feasibility of removing salicylic acid by adsorp-
tion with metal hydroxides. The following conclusions were
drawn based on the present investigation:
(1) Unlike the Fe electrode, using an Al electrode does not
result in more turbidity for the aqueous solutions and
is found to be more effective at removal, thus making
the use of an Al electrode more efficient and more
advantageous than the Fe electrode.
(2) In terms of the pH variation during EC, the generation
of coagulant metal hydroxides for the Al/Al electrode
pair is greater than that for the Fe/Fe electrode pair,
which also enhances the removal efficiency.
(3) Considering both the electric energy consumption and
the time to reach 90% removal, an applied voltage of
20 V and a temperature of 308 K are optimum values
for the present EC process.
(4) Values of the kinetic rate constants for salicylic acid
removal at various applied voltages and solution tem-
peratures were calculated. The kinetic results show
that a pseudo-second-order kinetic model fits the ex-
perimental data. In addition, the activation energy
is 20.21 J mole1 based on pseudo-second-order rate
constants from the Arrhenius equation, indicating that
salicylic acid abatement from aqueous solutions is at-
tributable to the EC process.
