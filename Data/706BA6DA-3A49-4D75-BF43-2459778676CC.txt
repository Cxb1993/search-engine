 Abstract 
In this study, the pet-like dog that interacts with reader for enhancing the reading cadenced is being 
developed. Acoustic behaviors of voice signals are recorded to analyze the condition during interaction. The 
reader reading rhythm is found by endpoint detector. The endpoint detector is a classifier and based on the 
Hidden Markov Model. It is trained by nonverbal auditory cues, such as zero-crossing rate, energy, spectrum, 
and autocorrelation. The spectrum and autocorrelation are chosen to recognize the periodic signal.  
To provide guidance of oral reading, the robot’s tail is developed into a two directions metronome by the 
two perpendicular motors. The goal is to classify reading states of the user, so the phase model of the words’ 
period in a sentence is defined, then the synchronization and rhythm parameter are defined by word phases. 
The synchronization parameter characterizes the users’ response models with respect to the tail input. And the 
rhythm of the sentence is characterized by the rhythm parameter. Measuring the rhythm parameter, if the 
rhythm parameter is far from the commanded rhythm, a new pace is then set up to control the metronome for 
the sentence reading guidance. The guidance rule for a specific user considers not only the rhythm parameter 
difference but also the synchronization parameter of the user.  
Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effect of guidance on oral reading performance. Rhythm 
parameters being controlled to approach better reading fluency is observed under the proposed guidance rule.

fluency among beginning readers in [1]. It also gives a review of many studies that have 
attempted to improve fluency. It indicated that assisted approaches, such as 
reading-while-listening, seem to be more effective than non-assisted approaches, such 
as repeated reading. The basic ideal of the robot instructional strategies was derived 
from this literature. 
The studies by Mastropieri, Leinart and Scruggs [2] reviewed the strategies for 
increasing reading fluency such as repeated reading, reading with computer or a reading 
with a peer. They indicated that careful application of combing some of these strategies 
can meaningfully improve reading fluency. The study was inspired by their work to 
design a robot for accompany readers. 
Rasinski [3] referred to reading fluency as the reader’s ability to develop control 
over surface-level text processing, so that he or she can focus on understanding the 
deeper levels of meaning embedded in the text. And he also referred to reading fluency 
has three important dimension that build a bridge to comprehension, such that accuracy 
in word decoding, automatic processing, and prosodic reading. In our work, our goal is 
to make sure that the reader does not place the equal emphasis on every word, which is 
related to the definition of the prosodic reading. 
Then we are focus on the rhythm. Wolff has the discussion in [4] that dyslexic 
students contrast to normal readers. The experiment is which had inordinate difficulty 
  4 
which was developed by Princeton (1980) [8]. This statistical model was usually used in 
speech recognition, but also used for the endpoint detecting in [9-11].  
1.3 Report Organization 
This report is divided into six chapters. In Chapter 2, signal processing techniques 
that were utilized to exact features for the endpoint detection are introduced. The 
endpoint detector based on a Hidden Markov Model was used to train and find the user 
state of reading are presented in Chapter 3. Then the pet dog platform and the 
turn-taking reading model are introduced in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, the application of 
this work and the discussion are presented. Finally, Chapter 6 gives conclusions and 
future work.

2.2 Basic Voice Signal Processing 
2.2.1 Sampling 
Computer can only handle discrete signal, however, real world signals are 
continuous in time. Therefore, we have to convert continuous time signals to discrete 
signals, and this process is called sampling.  
Mathematically, we perform sampling by multiplying a continuous signal by an 
impulse train which consists of periodic unit strength delta function in the domain of 
interest. Denoting the continuous waveform signal by ( )x t , and ( )px t  is the signal 
after sampling.  
( ) ( ) ( )px t x t p t=                                                 (2-1) 
( )p t  is the impulse train, as follow:

= ∑                                             (2-2) 
The signal after sampling ( )px t  has value only at st nT= , as the follow equation:

duration and the overlap, see the Fig 2.2 
 
Fig. 2.2Frame Blocking 
Longer duration come with fewer features could be detected in the speech signal. 
But if frame duration is small than a threshold, the result will be affected easily by the 
background noise. The feature extracted from each frame will be smoother by using 
frame overlap. Frame overlap is generally the half of frame duration.  
The values of frame duration FN  and overlap FM  are 256 and 128 point in this 
paper, which correspond to 32 ms frames and separated by 16 ms when the sampling 
rate of the speech is 8k Hz. 
The first frame consists of samples from 1 to FN . The start sample of the second 
frame is ( - 1)F FN M +  and the end sample is (2 - )F FN M . We assume that there are 
L  frames in the signal, and l  is the number of frame.  And the l  frame is from 
( -1)( - ) 1F Fl N M +  to ( -1)( - )  F F Fl N M N+ . By applying the frame partitioning to 
( )x n , one will get L  vectors of length FN , and ( )lf n  denoted the l  frame of the 
signal.

Even though it is not very robust against noisy backgrounds and impulsive 
interferences, energy is still a fundamental component in many widely used endpoint 
detectors. The relationship between voice signal and energy shows on Fig. 2.4.

series of very strong peaks resulting from the pitch period’s Fourier transform. This 
result in the banded regions we have in the spectrograms and in a highly structured set 
of peaks as seen in the first panel of Fig. 2.9. In the unvoiced frames, as seen in the right 
panel, we see a fairly noisy spectrum, be it silence (with low magnitudes) or a plosive 
sound (higher magnitudes). We thus expect the entropy of a distribution taking this form 
to be relatively high.

3.1 Hidden Markov Models 
To understand the problem of choosing the endpoint detection method, we must 
first examine the process of speech production and the Chinese language (We focus on 
Chinese language in this report). Speech can be broken up into two kinds of sounds: 
voiced and unvoiced. The voiced sounds are those that have a pitch, which we call 
vowel. The unvoiced sounds are everything else. Almost every Chinese word involves a 
vowel. Chinese is single syllable language. There are different states in the speech 
production process which we can’t see. We introduce the HMM idea in the below. 
We assume speech signal can be characterized as a parametric random process.  
We introduce the classifier hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM model is often 
used in speech recognition, because the same reason of the pronounced state concept. 
But it is much simplicity in our application. We use the two states HMM model as a 
classifier. One represent the voice state and the other one represent the unvoice state. A 
hidden Markov model is a Markov model where the states tq  are not directly 
observable. Instead, we can observe another measurement to that is related to tq  by 
the stationary probability distribution ( | )t tp o q , i.e., to  is a probabilistic function of 
the unobserved state tq .The graphical structure of the hidden Markov model is 
illustrated in Figure 3.1. 
  22 
( ){ }j kB b v= , ( )j kb v  is the probability of the observed variable in state j , as the 
follow equation: 
( ) ( )|j k t k t jb v P o v q S= = = , 1 ,1j N k M≤ ≤ ≤ ≤                    (3-2) 
5. The initial state distribution: 
{ }pi ipi= , ipi  is the initial probability that at state i , as follow: 
( )1i iP q Spi = = , 1 i N≤ ≤                                       (3-3) 
For convenience we usually use a compact notation ( ), ,piA Bλ =  to indicate the 
complete parameter set of an HMM. It also requires specification of two model 
parameters ( N  and M ).All parameters must be under the following constraints.

The relative probability equals to 40.294*10− . In fact it is not necessary to 
calculate all possible cases, it will be introduced in the below.  
In the next step, there is a HMM model will be established. This process involves 
  26 
computational requirements are on the order of 2

 operations. The need to compute 
(3-11) without the exponential growth of computation, as a function of the sequence 
length T , is the first challenge for implementation of the HMM technique. 
There is a more efficient method, called forward algorithm. First, define the 
forward variable: 
( ) ( )1 ,tt t ii P O q Sα λ= =                                      (3-12) 
( )t iα  is the probability of the partial observation sequence { }1 1 2, ,...,t tO o o o= up to

These parameters, then, would be updated, and go back to calculate the variables

are converged, and the HMM models are finally determinant. 
The training process chooses the observation with single Gaussians having 
diagonal covariance. We trained the model using several minutes of speech data from 
reading textbook regularly with voicing states labeled in each frame. 
3.2.3 The Decoding Problem 
In this problem, the purpose is to find the best state sequence. The forward 
algorithm described in the previous section can not find out such a state sequence, and 
the Viterbi algorithm can be applied to solve this problem efficiently. The Viterbi 
algorithm can be regarded as the dynamic programming algorithm applied to the HMM 
or as a modified forward algorithm.

situation. The synchronization parameter and rhythm parameter can also be defined for 
describing the turn-taking reading condition. Then the final section illustrates the 
method for “controlling” the reader and improving the reading fluency. 
4.1 Robotic Dog 
The robotic dog is selected because its pet-like look is accessible for the children. 
The robot is about 90 cm high with four wheels and the friendly appearance (see the Fig. 
4.1).

effective and a powerful way to improve its reading fluency. Besides, our purpose is to 
prepare an environment that children can learn by interacting with the robot, so we 
design an online training system with the robotic dog that can measure the reading 
fluency and giving the guidance while the user is reading.  
Measuring reading speed, word accuracy, pause duration, pitch, and stress are 
necessary factors to assess oral reading fluency. We assume that user has the basic 
ability that he/she can recognize every single word of the article. He can read every 
single word slowly, but he may not actually know the phrase meaning. The word 
accuracy can be ignored by this assumption. 
For simplifying the question, we also assume that the better pitch and stress of 
fluency can come with the better reading speed and the pause duration. Then the focus 
of this chapter is on the reading time adjustment. 
On early childhood teaching in reading, the gesture or hand clapping are 
commonly used for guiding the correct word time for a child. Giving the word reading 
tempo can enhance the impression of the sentence rhythm. According to this idea, the 
tail mechanism is developed into a kind of metronome, or a kind of conductor's baton. 
Its speed and direction can be decided by controlling two motor, the photo of tail is 
shown in the Fig. 4.3. 
  40 
 
Fig. 4.4 Four conditions of the tail  
Although it is impossible to catch the time exactly, the user generally can be lead to 
read in the specific rhythm by this way. The experiment in the next chapter verifies this 
point. 
After a user reads the sentence, the voice signal can be analyzed and the rhythm 
features could be calculated by the technique presented in the chapter 3. The process is 
under control to reach the desired fluency. The definition of the rhythm and the guiding 
signal provided b the tail will be illustrated in following section. 
There is a scenario designed for teaching fluency with the robot. The flow chart of 
the guided reading is shown in Fig. 4.5. The user can be taught the right oral reading 
paces of the article by the robot alone.

In this study, the user can be corresponded to the system, and the tail can be the 
controller. The robot is used to measure the error and produce the new waving time of 
the tail.  
When the tail’s signal is giving to user, the new output will be produced, just like 
the controller providing the signal to the system. Then the system output can be 
measured by the robot’s sensor and assessed by the computer of robot. The new tail’s 
action can be decided by this assessment of the fluency. The user can be affected by the 
different signals of the tail and read the sentence with different rhythm. So the Fig. 4.6 
can be interpreted to the Fig. 4.7.

Fig. 4.9  Example for the phase model. 
The control command time jt and the user time kt  can be defined in a unit 
circle.  jθ  and kθ  are phase angle corresponding to jt and kt  , respectively . 
The wp and θD are the synchronization error and the rhythm parameter. 
The phase model was illustrated using an unit circle as shown in Fig. 4.9. The 
standard time jt can be treated as a particle which on the constant speed circular motion.

The tail waving “particle” and the user reading “particle” are also traveling along 
the circle with the ω . The controlled performance can be examined after finishing the 
each round of the guided reading by checking the location of the particle.  
4.3.2 Error definition 
In the guided reading process, the purpose is making sure about the user following 
the paces with the tail and reading with the rhythm of expectation. There have two steps 
of the error definition, synchronization parameter and the rhythm parameter. 
Firstly, the synchronization error can be used to measure whether the user follow 
the tail paces exactly and the user is controllable with our method. The synchronization 
error can observe if the user follows the tail’s signal by calculating the difference 
between the jθ  and kθ . 
The synchronization error can be defined as

The parameter pθ  means the error in the whole sentence, which can represent the

pause will be longer than first two symbols.   
To describe the reading speed, three levels of the pause duration are defined as 
follows. This rhythm variable is defined by the relative kθ .

It is anticipated that most sentences’ pause duration could be described by the 
three-level pause duration parameters. When a sentence is given, the target D  can be 
established by a fluent reader. Then the user’s rhythm parameters are measured, and 
controlled to approach the target set up by the fluent reader.

process. 
Different user’s characteristics may cause different controlling result. Consider pθ  
as the controlled system characteristic, or the users’ ability to follow the tail. Smaller 
pθ  indicates that the system has naturally smaller phase bias, which can also represent 
that the system can be controlled more easily, and the system is more stable to accept 
various ranges of control input. Considering the human ability to follow the tail pace, 
control equations can be further transformed into the following.

The new time has the difference between the original times, but not huge enough to 
confuse the user. The user was affected by this waving time and tended to get the right

in giving the rhythm command.  
5.2 Experiment for Human Characteristic 
In this section, human response to the input of the tail device was tested by a rapid 
step command of the tail. To obtain the step response of the user, instead of using 
turn-taking reading, the user has to read and learn the rhythm at the same time. The 
identification process measures the instinct reaction of the human user to the tail input, 
the response may indicate the inherent reaction speed of the test subject to the robotic 
dog’s guiding device.  
The process was repeated ten times with the same pace, and the pθ  was recorded 
as shown in the Fig. 5.4. And if the experiment process becomes that the waving time 
was changed every five reading rounds, the result has been recorded as shown in Fig. 
5.5. Results shown in both figures were the averages of the subject’s responses out of 
five experiments. The test sentences were randomly generated series of numbers.

specific rhythm, and for identifying the subject’s response characteristic. pθ  is 
different for different users, provides information about the worst possible human delay 
m
p , that is a parameter for controlling the tail pace.  
5.3 Experiment of Turn-Taking Reading 
The final experiment was expected to simulate the turn-taking reading situation. 
The robot demonstrated the ideal pace by the tail first, and the user follows the tail in 
the next time. In the next round, the tail’s guiding time can be changed by the way Eqs. 
4-13 to 4-15 described. The rhythm vector, D  of one of the subject’s test results were 
shown in Fig.5.6 and Fig. 5.7. 
  60 
guided time approached a large time, the results tended to be stable within a certain 
bound of the commanded rhythm.  
Users with bigger 
m
p  comes with results of the increasing overshoots and with 
more displacement from the original phase. This may cause the user’s rhythm 
performance approaching the commanded rhythm values faster but also may cause the 
rhythm performance far from the original rhythm as shown in Fig. 5.8. 
The figure 5.8 is two of the user’s data of 1D on the different mp . It shows the 
effect of different
m
p . Higher

p results in bigger overshoots.

Figures 5.9 and 5.10 displayed the comparing results of the ratio of rhythm

And the user of the figure 5.10 doesn’t reach the goal. 
Data of ten subjects were recorded. The average time to reach the commanded ratio 
under control was 4.2th rounds, and the one without control was 9.2th round. The user’s 
data with control reached the commanded ratios in a shorter time compared to readers 
not under control of the tail. 
  64 
‘controlling’ the readers reading rhythm and improving the reading fluency were 
provided.  
The method was experimentally evaluated to illustrate its effectiveness. First of all, 
it has to be tested if the tail mechanism is effective to the user. The experiment can be 
done by simply testing the user’s responses to various tail commands. The human 
response characteristic to the input device was obtained by step inputs of rhythm 
commands. Reader’s controllability was modeled by a synchronization parameter. 
Based on this parameter, human’s delay in following the input commands was used to 
design control laws in the feedback loop to control the reading rhythm. The control law 
gives rhythm command changes following the error measures derived from the phase 
differences of each word in a sentence between a teacher and a reader’s oral reading 
voices. Results of reading fluency experiments with and without feedback control were 
compared, and the effectiveness of the proposed feedback method via robotic dog’s tail 
mechanism was evaluated. 
It was shown that the proposed guided reading technique through a robot in the 
feedback control loop is feasible. Parameters defined in this study display clearly the 
reader’s oral reading fluency performance. Control strategies for improving the fluency 
were established with an error measure modeled by the phase difference of each reading 
word in a sentence conducted by a teacher and by the reader. It was shown by

摘要 
本文為出席在北京舉辦之 2010年國際離岸及極地工程研討會（International 
Offshore (Ocean) and Polar Engineering Conference, ISOPE 2010）的報告。本文首
先整理該會議關於「水中生物機構」、「深海載具設計」、「載具導航控制」、
「海洋能源開發」等相關論文的大綱，並提出參加會議的心得，最後則是攜回資
料的目錄。 
 
一、參加會議經過 
長年從事水中生物運動機構研究之日本 Osaka大學 N. Kato教授，為國際上
在水中生物運動學領域之知名學者，與國內船舶及海洋工程領域的研究人員熟
識，並經常交換研發心得。由於他擔任本次 ISOPE 會議之 Technical Program 
Committee委員，經由他的邀請，我們決定參與他所主持之水中生物機構（Aqua

解並善用波動推進相關技術，可以對未來水下載具設計產生以下貢獻: 可建造較
省能源之載具；可建造能具高速操控能力之載具。可以預見在未來的載具設計理
念上，仿生型無人載具將佔有重要地位。 
 
2. 深海載具設計 
自主式水下載具( Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; AUVs ) 經過近 20年的研
究與推廣，已漸漸達到實用階段。根據本次會議所發表的論文，AUV 之應用技
術研究蔚為多數，尤其在使用多具 AUV編隊來執行任務的研究主題，將為未來
無人載具的主要研究題目。多具 AUV所形成的載具網路，可以架構在一固定於
海床的水下有線或無線網絡，利用彼此通訊與協同工作，來達到海洋狀態監測、
資料即時傳輸等大範圍、低成本的載具操作模式。本次會議有關深海 AUV載具
及導航的會議論文多為歐盟各會員國所參與的整合研究計畫成果報告。該計畫的
目標是發展協同水下載具群體的作業系統、發展多載具系統的程式語言、協同控
制方法、導航技術、通訊技術、感測器網路技術等。多載具定位的概念，其要求
是各載具有自己的導航系統，藉助於通訊傳遞相對距離，即可達成團隊的導航。
主要限制為有限的通訊能力，控制系統的穩定性等。 
有關深海遙控載具及導航的會議論文題目皆由日本的大學及研究機構所提
出。日本具有的先進技術及經驗，且投入最深者，為無人深海載具技術，其主要
功能為觀測海床之地震訊號與支援地球科學研究。這些先進的技術展示及經驗發
表實為本次會議之瑰寶，亦可見海洋科技領域從事人員對無人載具技術之期待。
雖然發展、使用、維護無人載具系統的花費相當可觀，但其對海洋工程、海洋科
技研究的功效也很大，所謂工欲善其事先必利其器，筆者深信，國內對於深海探
測載具之的需求在可見的未來應會逐漸明顯。

做即時的資料收集。載具的操作方式，由於考慮到近岸漁業活動的頻繁，因此設
定為除非有工作船前往回收，否則常駐在海底的模式。因此，載具的聲波通訊、
定位等設備必須有萬全的考量。機器人可能的承載儀器有：流速儀、物理化學參
數量測儀器、魚探機、海床底層聲納、側掃聲納等。近年來，有鑑於對海洋環境
的相關資料蒐集需求日趨重要，各國之前所發展的定點、精密的載具操作模式並
不是針對大範圍的作業需要，因此， 無人載具發展重點又重回傳統長程巡航式
的載具類型。在多機、近岸、長程等載具發展指導方針下，歐盟希望在最短期間
內可以提供海洋工業界及科學界一組泛用型載具，並由一所統整中心機構提供定
位、導航、通訊、數據之運用、模組式負載之開發等研發服務。歐盟與日本對深
海載具系統之經營概念，與我國所設置之海洋科技中心的想法相同。
