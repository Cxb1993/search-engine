Abstract
In this study, a commercial 6061 aluminum alloy was processed by equal channel angular
extrusion (ECAE) to large plastic strains (4~6). It is shown that pre-extrusion heat treatment has
significant influence on the properties of ECAE processed materials. As compared to the fully
annealed state, the solution treated state possesses better mechanical properties after ECAE.
Compared with conventional peak-aged condition (T651), the solution treated and
ECAE–processed 6061 alloy exhibits a ~25% increase in tensile strength and slightly inferior
tensile ductility. The effect of post-ECAE aging treatment was also investigated. Precipitations in
ECAE-processed alloy and in peak-aged alloy were studied by the use of transmission electron
microscopy.
Keywords: precipitation, mechanical properties, aluminum alloy, equal channel angular extrusion
1. Introduction
Recently it has been shown that alloys of ultrafine-grained structure can be produced by the
use of severe plastic deformation (SPD) [1]. One method for introducing large plastic strains into
bulk samples is equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) [2]. Many processing parameters can
affect the deformation structures resulted from ECAE. They are the die angle, which determines the
strain introduced into the material during each deformation pass [3]; the pass number through the
die, which corresponds to the total accumulated strain applied to the material; and the deformation
route, which involves rotating the billet between passes [4]. In addition, the extrusion speed [5],
extrusion temperature [6], and the friction between the die walls and the billet [7] are also important
parameters.
The majority of the materials fabricated by ECAE are pure metals or single phase materials. In
the literature, ECAE produced non-heat treatable aluminum alloys have been widely studied,
including pure aluminum [8-10], 1xxx aluminum alloys [11-15], Al-Mn alloys [16], and Al-Mg
alloys [6, 17-19], etc. There are relatively little studies on the application of ECAE to age-hardening
aluminum alloys. Recently, there are increased interests on this subject [20-26]
To process age-hardening aluminum alloys to large plastic strains will consider the following
factors: (1) the initial structure prior to ECAE, (2) the failure strain for material subjected to ECAE,
4after 3 and 4 ECAE passes at RT and 398K, respectively. In the following studies, the solution
treated material (S) was subjected to 6 ECAE passes at 423K (material S+ECAE), which gave
accumulated strain 4.02. Post-ECAE aging responses for both material O and material S were
investigated, which were compared with their counterparts without ECAE
Microhardness tests were used to follow the aging response. The tests were carried out with
200 g load and 15 s holding time on a Shimadzu HMV-2000 microhardness tester. Tensile tests
were performed on an Instron 5582 universal testing machine with an initial strain rate of 7 x 10-4
s-1. The gauge section of tensile specimens has dimensions of 16 x 4 x 1.5 mm. Transmission
electron microscope (Jeol JEM-3010) was used to examine the microstructure. Specimens were cut
from the flow plane of the extruded material with tensile axis parallel to the extrusion direction.
Thin foils were prepared by twin-jet electropolishing, in HNO3 + 70% CH3OH solution at 243 K
and 10V.
3. Results and Discussion
The aging response of material O+ECAE was investigated at 373 K, 423 K and 448 K. The
variation of hardness with aging time is shown in Fig. 1, in which the aging behavior of material O
without ECAE is included for comparison. The hardness of material O before aging is 44±1. For
material O, the hardness remains nearly unchanged throughout the aging treatment studied. This
might indicate that material O is quite stable, that the formation of precipitates is completed in the
full anneal treatment.
After ECAE, the hardness of material O increases from 44±1 to 90±1. The hardening resulted
from ECAE can be attributed to the presence of high density of dislocations distributed in a fine
subgrain structure (Fig. 2). The average length and width of the subgrains in material O+ECAE are
1~1.5 m and 0.2~0.6 m. For material O+ECAE, the variation of hardness with aging time
depends on the aging temperature. It shows monotonic increase at 373 K. However, at 423 K and
448 K, it shows age-hardening for short aging time and softening after reaching the peak hardness.
These results suggest that the large plastic strain imposed by ECAE might have caused some
precipitates dissolved into the aluminum matrix, which reprecipitated during aging. Murayama et al.
[29] reported that the second phase particles in an Al-1.7at% Cu alloy can be dissolved into the
aluminum matrix after large plastic strain imposed by ECAE. The softening after prolonged aging at
423 K and 448 K may be due to coarsening of precipitates as well as recovery of dislocation
structure produced by ECAE.
The aging response of materials S and S+ECAE were investigated at 373 K, 423 K and 448 K.
The variation of hardness with aging time is shown in Fig. 3. The hardness of material S is 69±1. A
peak hardness of 97±2 can be obtained for material S aged at 448 K for 24 h. The hardening is
resulted from the formation of fine precipitates during aging. As shown in Fig. 4, there are fine,
needle-shaped precipitates of ”-Mg2Si aligned in <100> matrix direction and homogeneously
distributed throughout the matrix, which is consistent with the literature [31].
6The large plastic strain imposed by ECAE results in a fine subgrain structure with high density
of dislocations, which is the main cause for the strengthening in material O+ECAE.
(2) Material S, the solution treated state, can be processed at 423 K by ECAE for 6 passes. In
addition to the fine subgrain structure with high density of dislocations, concurrent precipitation
of ”-Mg2Si also occurs during ECAE. Both the fine dislocation substructure and precipitates
have contributed to the high strength of material S+ECAE. As compared to T651, it shows
~25% increase in tensile strength with slightly lower tensile ductility.
(3) Post-ECAE aging treatment at 373 K or 423 K can cause further hardening in both material
O+ECAE and material S+ECAE.
