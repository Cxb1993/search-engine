英文摘要 
A double-layer antireflection (AR) coating fabricated using the single Indium tin 
oxide (ITO) conductive material is proposed. The high refractive index of the bottom 
ITO layer was achieved by long-throw radio-frequency magnetron sputtering 
technique at room temperature. On the other hand, the top ITO layer with low 
refractive index was prepared by applying supercritical CO2 (SCCO2) treatment at 
60o C on gel-coated ITO thin films. Porous structures were obtained with the SCCO2 
treatment to volatilize or extract organic matters from the films. Their refractive 
indices were precisely controlled by varying the sputtering power and the operation 
pressure of the long-throw sputtering and the SCCO2 treatment, respectively. 
Weighted reflectance and average transmittance of 4.3% and 86.2% were achieved 
for the double-layer ITO AR electrode. In addition, the effective resistivity of the 
ITO AR electrode is 1.6×10-2 Ωcm. 
 
1. Introduction 
 Elimination of undesired reflections from an optical surface is important for 
many technologies in optics and photonics. To reduce reflection, antireflection (AR) 
coating [1-5] is often used to match optical impedance of surrounding medium to 
substrate. AR coatings based on thin film technology are now industrial standard [6, 7] 
to increase light absorption of photovoltaic devices. However, it can be difficult to 
assure very low reflection because most semiconductor materials of solar cells have 
high refractive indices, and thin films of AR coating with specific refractive indices 
are required for matching the substrate impedance to air. In addition, material 
properties such as optical transmittance and electrical conductivity of AR coatings 
must be considered to avoid loss of device performance and complication of device 
fabrication. Therefore, ability of controlling refractive indices of thin films with 
desired material properties is of great importance for fabricating efficient AR coatings 
on solar cells with high refractive indices.  
 Conventional AR coating is consisted with single or multi-layered thin films 
with quarter-wavelength thickness. Single-layer quarter-wave coatings have simple 
(SCCO2) treatment [18-20] at low temperature. The obtained results suggest that the 
proposed porous ITO on sputtered ITO AR coatings can also function as efficient 
conductive electrodes for Si based solar cells. 
 SCCO2 treatment is a popular technique in electronic industry to extract and/or 
remove organic materials because the processes can be used in large area 
applications and can be cost effective since the chemicals used are recyclable, and 
the consumption of which is low. CO2 becomes supercritical at a temperature of 31 
°C and a pressure of 1071.3 psi. The supercritical CO2 fluid exhibits both liquid-like 
and gas-like properties, giving them excellent transport capability into nanoscale 
structures without damaging the host network. In fact, CO2 has been demonstrated as 
a good solvent for many organic compounds, such as isopropy, ester, alkylamine 
surfactant and some hydrocarbon-based machining oils [21, 22]. Although CO2 is the 
most frequently used supercritical fluid, it is not ionically active and has several 
limitations mainly due to its inability to dissolve high molecular weight compounds 
and to its nonpolarity and lack of several specific solvent-solute and solvent-polymer 
interactions. One of the solutions to this problem is to add a small amount of polar 
co-solvents, such as Isopropanol alcohol (IPA), to the non-polar CO2 fluid. This will 
result in a higher polarity supercritical mixed solvent and greatly enhance the 
solubility of polar solutes in these mixed solvents [23, 24]. 
2. Experimental 
 The double-layered AR electrode was consisted with a porous ITO thin film on 
top of a dense ITO thin film. The dense ITO films were prepared on Si substrates by 
long-throw radio-frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature with a 
target-to-substrate distance of 18 cm. The ITO target (50 mm diameter) composition 
was 90 % In2O3 and 10 % SnO2 (99.99 % purity) in weight. The sputtering chamber 
was evacuated to less than 5.0×10-4 Pa prior to sputtering and backfilled with argon 
gas. No oxygen was added during the growth to reduce ion bombardment to the films. 
The sputtering pressure was kept at 0.2 Pa, and the estimated mean-free path of the 
sputtering was less than 4 cm. ITO thin films used for this study were deposited on Si 
substrates using an rf power ranged from 30 to 120 W. The refractive indices of the 
films were detuned by varying the rf power of the deposition. On the other hand, the 
porous ITO films were formed on the sputtered ITO films by sol-gel spin coating 
followed by the SCCO2/IPA treatment. The ITO sol-gel solution was obtained from 
Kojundo Chemical Laboratory. After coating, the ITO samples were loaded into the 
SCCO2 processing chamber. High purity carbon dioxide was introduced into the 
chamber using a high pressure syringe pump. A small amount of IPA was added into 
the chamber followed by injection of pressurized liquid CO2 at a required pressure. 
The operation pressure of the treatment was ranged from 2000 to 5000 psi, and the 
highest refractive index of 2.19 was obtained at the rf power of 120 W, as compared 
with 1.99 of the film at 30 W. The detuning of the refractive index is 0.20 or 10% at 
the rf power ranged from 30 to 120 W. However, the increase of the sputtering power 
could also induce film damages due to bombardment of sputtered particles and 
negative ions, leading to a decrease of the film conductivity [27, 28]. For instance, the 
resistivity increased from 6.0×10-4 Ωcm at 30 W to 6.1×10-3 Ωcm at 120 W. Trade-off 
between the refractive index and electrical conductivity was clearly observed.  
 The performance of the proposed double-layer ITO AR electrode depends not 
only on the refractive index but also on the electrical conductivity of the films. Both 
must be considered to obtain AR coating with satisfactory optical and electrical 
performance. Accordingly, properties of the dense ITO prepared by long-throw 
sputtering at 40 W and 80 W, and porous ITO formed with the SCCO2/IPA treatment 
at 2000 psi were investigated as the bottom layers, and the top layer of the 
double-layer ITO AR electrodes.  
 Fig. 3 shows the AFM photos of the ITO surfaces prepared by the long-throw 
sputtering technique at (a) 40 W and (b) 80 W at room temperature, together with (c) 
the gel-coated ITO film after the SCCO2/IPA treatment at 2000 psi and 60°C. The 
root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the ITO samples prepared by the 
long-throw sputtering at 40 W, 80 W, and by the SCCO2/IPA treatment was 0.28 nm, 
0.63 nm, and 1.65 nm, respectively. Long-throw sputtering technique has already been 
proved to be effective in terms of producing surfaces with low roughness [16]. 
However, porous ITO films with higher surface roughness were expected since voids 
could form due to dissolving of the organic materials with the SCCO2/IPA treatments. 
Nevertheless, the obtained surface roughness was low, suggesting low surface 
scattering losses of incident lights. 
 The measured optical transmittance of the films at a wavelength ranged from 400 
to 1000 nm is shown in Fig. 4. The films for transmittance measurement were 
deposited on glass substrates with a thickness of 60 nm. The average transmittance of 
the sputtered ITO at 40 W, 80 W and the SCCO2/IPA treatment are 0.893, 0.871, and 
0.961, respectively. The porous ITO film exhibited higher transmittance than the 
dense ITO films because of its low index of refraction and low optical absorption at 
short wavelength range. The optical and electrical properties, together with the surface 
roughness of the ITO films prepared by the low-throw sputtering technique and the 
SCCO2/IPA treatment were summarized in Table I. 
 Fig. 5 shows the SEM photos of the (a) top and (b) cross-sectional images of the 
double-layer AR electrode. Porous structure of the top ITO film was clearly observed 
with a well defined interface to the bottom ITO layer. In addition, the porous ITO film 
was found to contain grains with a diameter of 10-15 nm. Voids with a diameter of 
pressure and sputtering power of the SCCO2/IPA treatment and the long-throw 
deposition. The proposed double-layer ITO AR electrodes achieved the weighted 
reflectance and effective resistivity of 4.3 % and 1.6×10-2 Ωcm, respectively. The 
measured results make the double-layer ITO AR electrodes a promising choice to 
improve the performance of a silicon based solar cell.
