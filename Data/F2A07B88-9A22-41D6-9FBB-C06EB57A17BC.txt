amplitude in used the BEI of SEM technical advantage, the polycrystalline OFHC 
with ultra-grain in low cycle fatigue under reduced strain amplitude was completed. 
After the fatigue, the microstructures of specimens were observed by means of BEI of 
SEM and TEM.  
 
Experimental 
A polycrystalline OFHC rod (99.95%) was used for this study. The specimens 
were annealed at 800 oC for 4 hours in a vacuum of 10-5 torr and then cooled in the 
furnace. The grain sizes of the specimens are about 600-800 µm, shown in Fig. 1. The 
preparation of specimens followed the instruction of ASTM E647 for hour glass. The 
low cycle fatigue was completed by a computerized Instron 8801 hydraulic testing 
machine at R=-1 (strain ratio, R=εmin/εmax) and at a frequency of about 1 Hz.  
At first, the low cycle fatigue is controlled at 0.3% (0.2%) strain amplitude during 
fatigue. Under this condition, the number of cycles reaches to 4000 (8000) cycles and 
then decreases the strain amplitude from 0.3% (0.2%) to 0.2% or 0.1% (0.1%). After 
drop the amplitude of strain, the low cycle fatigue is remain to someone cycle which 
is design by this research and remove the specimen from the fatigue machine. The 
experiment loading conditions were shown in Table 1. 
 To observe the dislocation morphologies, the specimens, which have finish the 
low cycle fatigue testing, were cut into a slice with 0.6 mm thickness along the cross 
section. The slices were ground to a thickness of 0.1-0.5 mm by abrasive paper and 
then punched into disks of 3 mm in diameter by using Gating puncher. The 3 mm 
disks were twin-jet polished using Struer D2 solution at 10 V and –10 oC to prepare 
the foil of electron microscope. The specimen difference between BEI of SEM and 
TEM is etching time. In the other words, the specimen of BEI of SEM is short etching 
time to avoid penetration and finish the surface polish, and the specimen of TEM is 
longer etching time to penetration on the specimen. This aim is creating thin region on 
specimen in order to provide the enough of thin region for TEM observation. After the 
specimen preparation, A Philip Qutan 200 SEM and Philip 200CM TEM were 
employed to investigate the microstructures in the variable loading low cycle fatigue 
specimens. 
 
Results 
After the low cycle fatigue under variable loading condition, list in Table 1, the 
stress vs .fatigue number of cycles of 0.3% strain amplitude shown in Fig. 2. At the 
same time, the S-N curves of 0.2% and 0.1% strain amplitude is similar the 0.3% 
strain amplitude. These results exhibit that no matter what the strain amplitude is, the 
S-N curves shows initiated hardening and then softening until fatigue fracture. 
 4
cycles after reduce strain amplitude, this phenomenon is more clear (specimen E). In 
Fig. 7(c), the dislocation structure apparent a misorientation cells, cells, walls and 
misorientation cells apart from the grain boundary (Fig. 10 is, Fig. 7(c) high 
magnification). This result is easy to observation in Fig. 9. According to the 
dislocation development and strain localization on grain boundary [10-13], the region 
of dislocation structure near grain boundary is fast than intragrain and more and more 
slow distance from the grain boundary. It reveals in that the dislocation structure is 
re-evolution reach to a balance between microstructure and applied load and then 
forward to dislocation positive revolution. By fatigue progression, the dislocation 
evolve to misorientation (Fig. 7(d) and Fig. 10) when the specimen fatigue to fracture 
after drop the strain amplitude from 0.3% to 0.2%  
For the specimen I, J and K (Fig. 8), in which fatigue to 1 x103, 5 x103 and 2 x104 
cycles after dropped the strain amplitude from 0.3% to 0.1% when fatigue to 4 x103 
cycles at 0.3% strain amplitude. Since the reduced strain amplitude at from 0.3% to 
0.1% is large than from 0.3% to 0.2%, the dislocation structure in specimen I (Figs. 
8(a) and (b)) change at fatigue 1 x103 cycles after drop strain amplitude is large than 
in specimen C (Fig 7(a)). Similar, the dislocation structure forward to positive 
evolution in specimen J (Fig. 8(c)) is fast than in specimen E (Fig. 6(c)). Based on 
above discussions, the dislocation structure re-development is making sure whatever 
the dropped strain amplitude large or small. The difference between Fig. 7 and 8 is the 
speed of re-evolution and reach to balance, and final toward the low energy 
dislocation structure development. 
In addition above, the same of dropped strain amplitude but difference strain 
amplitude before reduced (one is 0.3% and the other is 0.2%) had study (Figs 7 and 
9).Compare with Fig. 7 and Fig 9, It is manifest that the dislocation structure in Fig. 7 
is fast than Fig. 9 regardless dislocation re-evolution (Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 9(c)) or 
toward positive development (Fig. 7(d) and Fig. 9(d)). It is because of that the 
plasticity strain accumulation in 0.3% drop to 0.2% is greater than 0.2% drop to 0.1% 
in spite of the magnitude of the dropped strain amplitude is equal. However, the 
dislocation structure is misorientation cells is dominant in 0.2% strain amplitude at 
fatigue to 8 x103 cycles (Fig. 6), but the dislocation structures exhibit in that the 
misorien tation cells embedded in veins structure like as Figs 9(a) and (b). Although 
the Fig 9(a) and (b) is observed in fatigue to 1 x103 cycles after drop the strain 
amplitude from 0.2% to 0.1%, nevertheless based on dislocation development or 
re-development, the misorientation cells in Fig 9(a) and (b) is either extend for the 
dislocation development or re-evolution from misorientation cells to cells. According 
to Fig. 9(b), the aside of misorientation cells strip can reveal cells and short walls. 
Therefore, the microstructure in Fig. 9(a) is belonging to re-evolution status. This 
 6
dropped the strain amplitude from 0.2% to 0.1% under 8 x103 cycles at 0.2% strain 
amplitude, the microstructures reveal in Fig. 14. It shows the micro-crack in grain 
(Fig. 14(a)). To identify the micro-crack and microstructure in Fig. 14(a) (specimen p), 
the Fig. 14(b) is the Fig. 14(a) high magnification. It is very clear exhibition that the 
micro-cracks embedded the band, and the microstructure in band is mixes walls and 
loop patches dislocation structure. Compare with the Figs. 12 and 14, the difference is 
miss the misorientation cells in Fig. 14. Consequently, the micro-cracks should be 
created by misorientation cells and along its direction of slip bands. Aside from, it still 
can be observe cells structure in aside of micro-crack (Fig.14(b), label in C). The 
similar structure (Fig. 15) was observer at fatigue to 5 x103 cycles after dropped the 
strain amplitude from 0.3% to 0.2% under 4 x103 cycles at 0.3% strain amplitude. The 
alternation slabs with 3-5 degrees miss angle.  
 
Conclusions 
In this study, the OFHC with ultra-grain was used in variable fatigue test. In 
general, the results reveal the dislocation is obey to evolve from loop patch, veins, 
PSBs, walls, cells and then misorientation at the plastic strain accumulation during 
fatigue. Final, the fatigue fracture accompany dislocation is low energy cells structure 
no matter the strain amplitude is under constant strain amplitude. At the same time, 
the dislocation structures reveal re-evolution when the strain amplitude subjected to a 
high-low variable. However, the special dislocation morphology was observation in 
ultra- lager grain of OFHC. The conclusions are summaries as following; 
1. The S-N curves appear hardening at first stage and then continue softening until 
fracture. No plateau and secondary hardening occur. It is due to the larger grain 
with the larger saturation stress and in order to regulate the high saturation stress 
induce a large of band with same direction.  
2. In spite of the range of dropped strain amplitude is the same, the fatigue with 
higher initial strain amplitude with the fast dislocation structures re-development 
and re-reached balance between microstructure and applied load. 
3. Because the specimen with ultra-large grain and with higher fatigue saturation 
stress, once the secondary slip system was trigged upon create amount of slip 
systems. At the same time, decrease the strain amplitude induces insufficiency 
plasticity strain energy to balance the microstructures which were created by 
before dropped strain amplitude. Therefore, the large of slip systems can not 
extend but remain operation during fatigue progression. The results induce the 
dislocation structure evolve to misorientation cells in slip bands. Consequently, 
a microstructure with misorientation cells bands embedded veins structure was 
formed.
