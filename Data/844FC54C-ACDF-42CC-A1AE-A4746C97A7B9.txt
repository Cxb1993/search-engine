1. Introduction 
The purpose of productive maintenance management (PMM) is to promote the 
productive efficiency. The early productive maintenance management is the breakdown 
maintenance. This policy cannot be a control system. The breakdown is sudden and the lost is 
too much. But following much maintenance management activities we have got more 
experiences. From the ironic walls to the production engines, we can understand the 
preventive maintenance (PM). The PM comes after the arrival of malfunction; the system is 
maintained or repaired minimally depending on the order of severity. After several 
maintained periods, the system is an improvement or replace. This policy could reduce 
sudden equipment fault. 
The information technology (IT) has been advanced currently. We do productive 
maintenance management from PM up to predictive maintenance. The predictive maintenance 
uses scientific approaches and avoids productive equipment breakdown suddenly. Predictive 
maintenance promoters claim that you can spot potentially equipment failures for a long time 
before they happen. The predictive maintenance needs IT that we have no choice to avoid. 
We can collect running message from Human machine interface (HMI) of equipments, and to 
build maintenance database system and analysis equipment running status. To avoid 
equipment fault by predictive maintenance as well. The main purpose of the implementation 
is to promote the efficiency of productive equipment and cost effectiveness of manufacturing. 
This will strengthen the company and help it to maintain company’s competitive advantage. 
This development is the building and applications of computerized maintenance 
management illustrated. It is expected to achieve objectives: 
1. To reduce equipment breakdown, promote productive efficiency and reduce 
equipment maintenance cost. 
2. To estimate inventory quality and achieve reasonable inventory. 
3. To build knowledge management, troubleshooting technique and the sharing 
repair experience. We can develop the human resources and to promote 
maintenance technical personnel efficiency. 
This research will provide the structure of equipment maintenance management database 
 4 
compared to the mentalities and methods of the 1960s and 1970s, it can easily be seen that we 
have rapidly come a very long way. It can also be seen that the maintenance management is of 
vital strategic importance and is no longer the necessary evil that it was once considered 
(Mather, 2002). 
There are three main advantages of CMMS: 
1. Rapid information storage and retrieval. 
2. Rapid calculation. 
3. Ability to handle very large amounts of information. 
Computer science technology has been improving fast with the passage of the time. Many 
manufacturing firms have widely equipped the automatic equipments to cut down the 
employment of labor workforce. However, adopting highly automatic equipments has turned 
out to require the higher maintenance cost than that of adopting the traditional equipments; 
the need of more involvement of manpower to solve the equipment running trouble is 
necessary, while standard production has been improving through it, though. Therefore, it is 
crucial for the managers to take the higher maintenance cost, production efficiency and 
enterprise competition into consideration on equipping the automatic equipments. MM 
(Maintenance Management) is a data intensive activity. Many maintenance departments 
handle work many orders per year, issuing thousands of separate preventive maintenance 
tasks covering thousands of machines and other types of equipment, and must generate 
frequent reports as soon after the end of the reporting period as possible so that the data is 
fresh and useful. Automated information systems are particularly well suited to these reports 
(Westeramp, 1997). 
Express Maintenance is premier in CMMS. Designed for rugged multi-user 
environments, it is affordable and easy to be used. Express Maintenance automates 
preventative and non-scheduled maintenance for any type of equipments. Generating work 
orders, tracking scheduled services and managing maintenance history, employee time, 
downtime, parts inventory and purchase orders, all of this data combined with our built-in 
report builder gives us the most powerful maintenance management system available. 
The overall competitiveness has forced companies to improve the overall performance of 
the business. In the area of maintenance, much has been written about strategies such as total 
productive maintenance (TPM) or reliability centered maintenance (RCM) in order to 
increase the reliability and therefore capacity of the industrial plants in their quest for 
world-class maintenance (Tsang & Chan, 2000). However, if a strategy is to be effective, it 
must be supported with an invaluable resource and information. In the proposed work, the

For example, Allen-Bradley automation company in Figure 3.2 shows that how to use 
RSView software to create the project for HMI, definition of tag name and draw graphics of 
the HMI. Tag name then needs the mapping PLC of I/O address. When starting the project, 
the HMI will transfer interface to PLC. Setting up direct driver communications, RSView32 
uses a direct connection to the drivers in RSLinx to communicate with most Allen-Bradley 
devices. You can also use DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) or OPC (Ole for Process Control) 
named OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) to connect to the third-party devices or servers. 
The run-time modes of HMI designed by users, it will monitor the productive equipment 
running status shown in Figure 3.3.

For the case study, we collect raw data from 2004/10/11 to 2005/5/31 electrical 
equipment fault events in one chemical manufactory. Collection of about 3400 jobs is to the 
analysis. The test plant of maintenance department service four factories, A, B, C, D, is to run 
CMMS nearly seven month. The past MMS flowchart is shown in Figure 3.8. The study tries 
to develop a new model. The new model built and applied a maintenance management by 
computerized database (applications in Chinese). It improves efficiency enormously. The 
flowchart is shown in Figure 3.9.

Time-Series template, and customized analysis tools. Charting tools to drill into data, Bar 
Graph, Grid, Pie Chart, Pareto, Powerful time-toolbar simplifies selecting desired time 
boundaries. Historian can also analyze data collected by applications (Kwon & Lee, 2004). 
Data mining is about solving problems by analyzing data already present in databases. We 
can use the maintenance management system resources on more effective and efficient 
solutions.  
This research collects raw data of electrical equipment fault event in one chemical 
manufactory. The data of Job-id, Date, Technician, Compound, Case and Analysis will be 
shown in Figure 4.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.1 CMMS database 
 A query can be thought of as a request of the database, the response to which is a new 
table, which we will refer to as a result table. Access 2000 supports a variety of query types. 
The CMMS is applied exactly. Searching from MMS database for forecasting equipment fault 
shown in Figure 4.2 is equipment fault frequency and status (warning or alarm). Figure 4.3 is 
shown to equipment running status analysis for maintenance strategy. Giving an example: 
/*Access SQL language */ 
SELECT MMS.Date, MMS.[Fault descript], MMS.Factory, MMS.System, MMS.Machine 
FROM MMS 
WHERE (((MMS.Date) In (SELECT [Date] FROM [MMS] As Tmp GROUP BY 
[Date],[Fault descript] HAVING Count(*)>1 And [Fault descript] = [MMS].[Fault 
descript]))) 
ORDER BY MMS.Date, MMS.[Fault descript]; 
 
 7 
We search from MMS database the estimated same equipment troubleshooting job 
times. The result is shown in Figure 4.4. It can make the reasonable maintenance period. We 
also apply the search functions according to the following type: 
/*Access SQL language */ 
SELECT [Factory], [System], [Machine], [Date], [Fault describe] 
FROM search MMS duplicate 
WHERE [Factory] In (SELECT [Factory] FROM [search MMS duplicate] As Tmp 
GROUP BY [Factory],[System],[Machine] HAVING Count(*)>1 And [System] = [search 
MMS duplicate].[System] And [Machine] = [search MMS duplicate].[Machine]) 
ORDER BY [Factory], [System], [Machine]; 
/*END*/

Search from MMS database for estimated equipment troubleshooting job that needs 
how many inventory. Figure 4.5 is shown in maintenance inventory quality analysis for 
maintenance strategy.
