1. Introduction 
The averages control chart (or X  chart) is widely applied in statistical process control. 
Traditionally, the standard Shewhart X  control chart (SS X  chart) is static in the sense that all 
three parameters (i.e., sampling interval h, sample size n and action limit coefficient k) are fixed for 
the duration of operation that is monitored. Recently developed adaptive X  charts have been 
shown to give substantially faster detection of most process shifts than the SS X  chart by 
statistical design. The X  chart is adaptive if at least one of the parameters, i.e., h, n and k, is 
allowed to change in real time based on the actual sample point. The adaptive X  charts include 
the variable sampling intervals (VSI) X  chart, the variable sample size (VSS) X  chart, the 
variable sampling rate (VSR) and the variable parameters (VP) X  chart. Some authors, e.g., 
Reynolds et al. 1988, Prabhu et al. 1993, Costa 1994, Prabhu et al. 1994, Reynolds 1996a, 1996b, 
Costa 1997, 1999, and Magalhães et al. 2005, presented the design of adaptive X  charts with 
respect to statistical criteria. While the other authors developed the economic design of adaptive X  
charts from the viewpoint of cost, e.g., Park and Reynolds 1994, 1999, Prabhu et al. 1997, Bai and 
Lee 1998, Magalhães et al. 2001, Costa and Rahim 2001, Magalhães et al. 2002. It was shown that 
the design with adaptive control scheme is generally more economical than the fixed parameters 
design. 
Traditionally, when designing control charts, one usually assumes that the measurements or 
collected data in the subgroup are normally distributed. However, this assumption may not be 
tenable in some production processes. If the measurements are normally distributed, the sample 
statistic X  is also normally distributed. If the measurements are non-normally distributed, the 
statistic X  is approximately normally distributed only when the sample size n is sufficiently large 
(based on the central limit theorem). Unfortunately, when a control chart is applied to monitor the 
process, the sample size n is always not sufficiently large due to the sampling cost. Therefore, if the 
measurements are not normally distributed, the traditional way for designing the control chart may 
not be appropriate. Lin and Chou (2007) used the gamma and t distributions to statistically design 
the parameters of a VP X  control chart for non-normal data. However, they did not involve cost 
consideration in the design of VP X  charts. 
In the present study, the economic design of the adaptive X  charts for skewed data is 
developed and evaluated. The cost function given by Lorenzen and Vance (1986) is employed and 
modified and Markov chain approach is applied to manipulate the necessary calculations. The 
gamma distribution is used to describe various skewed distributions. In the following sections, the 
adaptive X  chart, the gamma distribution, the cost function of Lorenzen and Vance (1986) and 
Markov chain approach are briefly reviewed. An example is then presented to illustrate the solution 
procedure of the economic design of the adaptive X  chart for skewed data. A sensitivity analysis 
is conducted to evaluate the effect of input parameters and skewness of population on the optimal 
economically design of adaptive X  chart. 
 
2. Background

was used to represent various skewed populations. When the population has a gamma distribution, 
the sampling distribution of X  also follows a gamma distribution. In the present study, the gamma 
distribution is chosen to study the effect of the adaptive X  control chart for skewed data. 
The gamma distribution, denoted by Gam(α , β ), has the probability density function (pdf)

where the parameters α  and β  are respectively the shape and scale parameters. The 
moment-generating function of a gamma distribution is

X . 
It can be shown that the mean and variance of a gamma distribution are respectively αβ  and 2αβ . 
For α = 1, the gamma distribution reduces to the exponential distribution with mean β1  and 
variance 21 β . 
Let X  be the sample average (with sample size n) from a gamma distribution with α  and 
β . Then the moment-generating function of X  is 
[ ] ββ α /,])/(1[ 1)()()( )/( nttneEeEtM nnxntxtX <−=== . 
Thus, the density function of X  also follows a gamma distribution with parameters αn  and 
n/β , and with mean αβ  and variance n2αβ .  
As the population follows a gamma distribution Gam(α , β ), the action limits of the adaptive 
X  chart with sample size ni can be determined by (LCLi, UCLi) = ( ii nk αβαβ − , 
ii nk αβαβ + ), and the corresponding warning limits with sample size ni can be determined by 
(LWLi, UWLi) = ( ii nw αβαβ − , ii nw αβαβ + ). 
 
2.3.The cost function 
Lorenaen and Vance (1986) presented a cost function for determining the economic design of 
control charts. Prabhu et al. (1997), Magalhães et al. (2002) and Magalhães et al. (2005) extended 
this cost function to the economic design of adaptive X  charts. In this cost function, the four 
average cycle length components are as follows: 
(1) Assuming that the process begins in the in-control state, the time interval that the process 
remains in control is an exponential random variable with mean λ1 . The time of investigation 
of a false alarm is )()1( 01 FETγ− , where 1γ  is an indicator variable, (i.e., let 1γ =1 if 
production continues during searches and 1γ =0 if production ceases during searches), 0T  is 
the average time searching for the false alarms, and E(F) is the expected number of false alarms 
during in-control period. Then, the average process in-control time is )()1(1 01 FETγλ −+ . 
 7
(1997) and Costa and Rahim (2001) presented a Markov chain approach for calculating the cost 
function. We extend this approach to calculate AATS, E(F), )( inNE , )( outNE , )( inSE  and 
)( outSE  when the process data follow a gamma distribution with mean αβμ =0  and variance 
22 αβσ = . 
 
3. Application and comparison of various adaptive charts  
Application of developed economic model for the adaptive X  charts is demonstrated using 
the numerical example in Lorenzen and Vance (1986). The values of the input parameters are: 
h60/510 === gTT , h60/452 =T , h50/1 =λ , C0=$114.24 per h, C1=$949.20 per h; 
Y=W=$977.40, a=0, b=$4.22, 11 =γ  and 02 =γ . Assume that the process data are from a gamma 
distribution with α = 4 and β = 1. 
The main difficulty in the use of economic design is to determine the optimal values of design 
parameters, i.e., h1, h2, n1, n2, k1, k2, w1 and w2. In the present study, the genetic algorithm (GA) is 
developed as a method for solving the optimization problem. GA is a series of search algorithms 
based on the natural evolution of the species, and has been widely used in the literature for 
optimization procedure, e.g., Chou, et al., 2006a, 2006b. The operation of GA involves the 
following steps: (a) Creation a random initial solution; (b) Evaluation of fitness, i.e., the objective 
function that minimizes the ECTU; (c) Reproduction, crossover and mutation; (d) Generation of a 
new solution. The algorithm uses an iterative procedure to search for the optimal solution. 
The economic design of the adaptive X  charts (i.e., SS, VSI, VSS, VSR and VP X  charts) 
is to determine the appropriate values of design parameters such that ECTU may be minimized. To 
simplify the optimization procedure and to ensure the resulting design parameters are feasible in 
practice, optimization of the ECTU is accomplished considering the following constraints: 
401 ≤≤ n , 31.0 ≤≤ h , 81 ≤≤ k , kw ≤≤1.0 , 401 21 ≤≤≤ nn , 31.0 12 ≤≤≤ hh , 
81 12 ≤≤≤ kk , 121.0 ww ≤≤ , 11 kw ≤  and 22 kw ≤ . Several mean shifts are considered: δ =0.5, 
0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5 and 2. 
In the present study, the performance indicators for control schemes are used as follows:  
(1) Obs./hr. gives the expected number of observations taken per hour during in-control periods of  
the process, which indicates the average sampling rate when the process is in-control.  
(2) FA./1000 hrs. gives 1000 times of the expected number false alarms per hour during in-control 
 periods, which indicates the average false alarm rate when the process is in control.  
(3) AATS gives the expected time from the occurrence of an assignable cause to the time when the  
chart indicates an out-of-control signal, which may be considered as the average detection time  
when the process is out of control.  
(4) ECTU gives the minimum ratio of the expected cost per cycle to the expected cycle time.  
Table 1 presents the optimal design parameters and performance indicators of various adaptive 
X  charts. From Table 1, the following observations can be made: 
(1) The VP X  charts have relatively lower FA./1000 hrs., AATS and ECTU values than other 
control charts, which indicates the VP X  charts have relatively smaller false alarm rate, 
faster detection time and lower cost to detect the process mean shifts. However, the VP X

4. A sensitivity analysis 
As discussed before, it is shown that the VP X  chart always has the lower cost than the other 
adaptive X  charts. Herein, we present a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters on the 
solution of the economic design of a VP X  chart for both skewed and normal data. The values of 
the input parameters are taken from Magalhães et al. (2002) as follows: δ =0.5 and 1.0, λ =0.01 
and 0.05, C1=650 and 1230, b=2 and 5. Then, the normal and two gamma distributions, i.e., 
Gam(4,1) and Gam(1,1), are used to study the effect of the skewed population. The skewness of 
Gam(1,1) is very heavy and far away from normality, i.e., the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis 
are 2 and 9, respectively. The values of the other input parameters are the same as those given in 
Section 3.  
Figures 1 present the optimal design parameters and the optimal ECTU under various 
combinations of the input parameters and distributions. From Figures 1(a)-(i), it can be observed 
that the optimal values for the ECTU are nearly same value for various distributions, which 
indicates the optimal design of the VP X  charts have similar quality cost under normal and 
skewed distributions. Compared with normality, skewed data lead to a larger small sample size n1, a 
longer long sampling interval h1, and a smaller narrow action limit coefficient k2. As the value of δ  
is large and the population is far away from normality, the wide action limit coefficient k1 becomes 
large substantially (especially for δ =1.0 and Gam (1,1) case, the values of k1 are close to 8, the 
effect of a large k1 is to reduce the false alarm rate). 
The input parameter δ  is the magnitude of the process mean shift. A large δ  tends to 
decrease the long sampling interval h1 and two sample sizes n1 and n2, and to increase action limit 
coefficients k1 and k2. As δ  increases, the values of Obs./hr., FA./1000hrs., AATS and ECTU 
decrease. That is, the effect of increasing δ  is to decrease the sampling rate, the false alarm rate, 
the detection time and quality cost.  
The input parameter C1 determines the expected costs per hour of producing non-conforming 
products during the out-of-control period. Increasing C1 tends to decrease the long sampling interval 
h1 and narrow action limit coefficient k2. As C1 increases, the values of Obs./hr., FA./1000hrs. and 
ECTU increase, and the value of AATS decreases. The effect of increasing C1 is to increase the 
sampling rate, the false alarm rate and quality cost, and to decrease the detection time. 
The input parameter λ  determines how often an assignable cause occurs. A small value of λ  
indicates the infrequent occurrence of assignable cause in the process. Increasing λ  tends to 
decrease the long sampling interval h1, large sample size n2 and narrow action limit coefficient k2. 
As λ  increases, the values of Obs./hr., FA./1000hrs. and ECTU increase, and the value of AATS
