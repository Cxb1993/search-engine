DHP is one of the forward-in-time computing techniques 
of dynamic programming [5] [6] [7] [8]. In this text, the 
velocity profile prescribing system based on DHP is called 
the Adaptive Critic Train Profile (ACTP) system. ACTP-TC 
abbreviates an ACTP system prescribing with both the 
traction effort and the coasting point. ACTP-C abbreviates 
an ACTP control system prescribing solely with the coasting 
point. Other than the ACTP system, there has been the 
Flat-Out Train Profile (FOTP) system in which no coasting 
is allowed; the Fixed-point Coasting Train Profile (FCTP) 
system in which coasting happens at a fixed location; and the 
Exact-time Coasting Train Profile (ECTP) system in which 
the coasting point is unique as coasting is possible. 
2. Train Profile Control Problem 
Fig. 1 shows a typical velocity profile and the associated 
schedule of MRT trains. The train schedule made by the 
automatic train regulation function assigns the departure 
times, running times and dwell times of each train on the 
line.

The rolling resistance of a Taipei MRT train is as follows:

The characteristic of powering performance of a typical 
traction system consists of a constant torque mode, a 
constant voltage mode and a constant power mode [9]. The 
corresponding train accelerations are as follows:

where a ’s and b’s are constants dependent of the traction 
system. 
Train velocity in the cruising mode or approaching mode 
is constant. For other modes, the velocity profile is 
characterized by the profile function as follows:  
( ) ( )

= = =   (6)  
 where ψφ  is the acceleration and { }1, 2, ,8ψ ∈ =Ψ !  
indexes a mode. Table 2 shows the profile functions. 
For a velocity profile, the velocity during coasting can be 
calculated as follows:  
( )( )ttCtanv cv γαβ −+=   (m/s)  (7)

condition be ( ) cc vtv =  where coasting commences then

Since the deceleration profile destined for approaching a 
station is determined, the coasting mode terminates at the 
regenerating point, indicated by ( )( ),r ry v v  in Fig. 1, where 
the coasting profile meets the deceleration profile. Once the 
regenerating point is known, the coasting duration can be 
calculated by (7). 
Define the state vector, on-train control vector and 
functional vector as follows:  
[ ]1 2 Ty y=Y [ ]Ty v= , [ ]TT A Bδ δ=u , and 
1 2
Tf fψ ψ ψ =  F = ( ) Tv vψφ     
where T denotes the transpose of vector, ( )vψφ  is the 
acceleration during mode ψ , and Aδ  and Bδ  represent the 
traction and braking efforts, respectively. Then, the train 
dynamics between two stations can be expressed by the 
piecewise state equations, 
( ) for T,ψ ψ= ∈Y F Y u Ψ"            (9) 
Referring to Fig. 1, the running distance of the cruising 
mode is ( ) ( )c dcuty v y v− . For the distance conservation, the 
cruising mode needs sustain duration as follows:

new weight vector is calculated in the way of similar to (28). 
In deriving the expression (33), ( ) ( )Sq w q∂λ # =0 was used. 
That requests the critic neural network being relatively 
stationary with respect to the shadow critic neural network. 
Otherwise, since the critic neural network duplicates the 
corresponding weights in the shadow critic neural network, 
(33) may result in bad convergence. A significant advantage 
of the ACTP system is that learning is guided by the utility 
function instead of the training examples. This makes the 
learning mechanism autonomous.

4. Applications of ACTP System 
To verify the effectiveness and performance of the ACTP 
system, simulation studies are conducted by using train and 
track parameters taken from Blue line of Taipei MRT 
system. 
Experiment 1: Effectiveness of ACTP system 
The scheduled running time is set to 90 seconds. The 
ACTP-TC system is used to generate the train-drive 
commands. The results of train control are shown in Table 2. 
Fig. 4 shows the resulting velocity profile. Table 3 shows 
the results of reducing the running time deviation by 
emphasizing the corresponding term in the primary utility 
function. 
It seems effective, but the procedure in compromising the 
weight factors is inefficient. Next experiment shows the set 
point correction strategy is much more efficient in correcting 
the running time deviation.

Experiment 2: Comparison in the energy cost and 
running time deviation 
Consider the velocity profile of using Level-II (90%) 
traction plus coasting control. The coasting vector refers to 
actual amounts used in the Blue line. Fig. 5 shows the typical 
train profiles and the coasting vector. The results of train 
control between Station k and Station k+1 are shown by the
