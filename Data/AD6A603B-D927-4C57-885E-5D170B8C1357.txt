21.“Investigation on capacity fading of aqueous MnO2·nH2O
electrochemical capacitor,”J. Power Sources, 177, 660-664 (2008).
Cycle stability of MnO2·nH2O electrochemical capacitors (ECs) has been studied
by using galvanostatic tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The
extent of capacity fading, ranging from 5 to 30% in 1000 cycles, increases with
current-rate, and is markedly reduced with increasing binder content. Two fading
mechanisms have been identified. With low binder content, and at high current-rate,
capacity fading occurs in conjunction with appreciable increase in transmission
resistance, suggesting progressively deteriorating electric contacts among the
pseudocapacitive oxide particles and conductive carbon. The mechanical failure of the
electrode structure may arise from the cyclic volumetric variation of the
pseudocapacitive oxide particles as previously reported. With high binder content or
at low current-rate, capacity fading is associated with increasing interfacial
charge-transfer resistance upon cycling, which has a less pronounced effect than the
mechanical failure mechanism.
本研究利用在定電流下充放電及電化學交流阻抗分析的方式,探討氧化錳超高電
容器的循環壽命. 經過 1000次充放電測試之後,從實驗結果發現,隨著充放電速
率增加,電容量衰退約從5%至30%, 而且若黏結劑的含量提高,則可顯著減少電容
量的衰退.當電容器於低含量黏結劑並在高速率電流下進行充放電時,明顯觀察到
電容量衰退的發生與電極內部阻抗升高有關,此現象應是由於氧化錳顆粒與助導
劑碳黑的接觸介面被嚴重破壞,導致複合材料結構出現改變.此種電極結構的變化
便會影響超高電容器的電化學行為.然而若是將黏結劑含量提高或是在低電流速
率下充放電進行循環壽命測試,電容量衰退則是與電荷傳遞阻抗增高有關, 此種
變因若與電極結構的機械性質產生變化相比,對循環壽命的影響則較輕微.

potassium poly(acrylate) hydrogel electrolyte,”J. Power Sources 179,
430-434 (2008).
An aqueous gel electrolyte has for the first time been successfully applied to the
MnO2·nH2O-based pseudocapacitive electrochemical capacitors (ECs). The gel
electrolyte is made of potassium poly(acrylate) (PAAK) polymer and aqueous
solution of KCl. With the selected composition, PAAK:KCl:H2O= 9.0%:6.7%:84.3%

Nanocrystalline MnFe2O4 having a spinel structure with Mn and Fe ions randomly
distributed over the tetrahedral and octahedral sites have been found to exhibit
capacitive characteristics in organic electrolyte containing 1M LiPF6 in the mixture of
ethyl carbonate + ethylene methyl carbonate. As characterized by cyclic voltammetry
and in-situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the material show reversible
pseudocapacitance behavior over a potential window from 1.75V to 4.5 V versus
Li/Li+ with a specific capacitance of ~125 F/g. Asymmetric supercapacitors
consisting of LiMn2O4 cathode and MnFe2O4 anode and Li organic electrolyte has
thus been developed and characterized for their electrochemical performance in a

be a serious issue in causing charge-storage capacity fading of
MnO2·nH2O EC.
2. Experimental
MnO2·nH2O particles were precipitated by mixing 0.15 M
KMnO4 and 0.15 M MnSO4 aqueous solutions with a
Mn(VII)/Mn(II) molar ratio of 2:3 (stoichiometric) at 25 ◦C.
After thoroughly washing with de-ionized water, the particles
were finally heated at 200 ◦C for 1 h in air. To prepare the elec-
trode, slurry containing the oxide powder, acetylene black (AB),
and PVdF was coated onto Ti foils, and finally dried at 120 ◦C
for 6 h in vacuum. On the dry basis, the oxide to AB ratio was
fixed at 7:3, while the binder, which used N-methyl pyrrolidone
(NMP, Mitsubishi Chemical) as the dispersing solvent, had a
weight composition of either 7.2 or 13.4%. The electrodes and
cells will hereafter be referred to with a prefix of 7 and 13%,
respectively, to indicate their binder contents. Every electrode
contains approximately 5.0 mg cm−2 of dried overlay materi-
als, although the weight may vary slightly (±10%) from one
electrode to another.
Electrochemical characterizations, including cyclic voltam-
metry, constant-current cycling, and EIS, were carried out with a
symmetric two-electrode configuration, where two MnO2·nH2O
electrodes of 1 cm × 1 cm were clamped between two glass
slides and separated with a porous separator (BS0712, Coin
Nano Tech), and the electrolyte is aqueous 1 M NaCl. The tests
were carried out on an electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie
PGSTAT30). Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy
(Optima 3000XL) was employed to determine the Mn content
in electrolyte solution.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 summarizes the CV data at different scan rates for
a typical MnO2·nH2O cell employed in the present study.
The voltammograms exhibit essentially rectangular-shaped pro-
files, characteristic of a capacitor. By taking into account of
the electrode overlay, composition, and subtracting the con-
tribution from the carbon component (∼10.0 F g−1 C), the
specific capacitance of the oxide phase was calculated to be

134.6 F g−1 MnO2·nH2O. Higher specific capacitances exceed-
ing 200 F g−1 of MnO2·nH2O have been reported in the literature
[6,7] but only for much thinner electrodes.
The C/D cycling tests were carried out at current densities
of 2.0 and 0.5 A g−1 (the current densities are based on the
total weight of the active materials, including MnO2·nH2O and
AB). A current density of 2.0 A g−1 corresponds approximately
to a scan rate of ∼60 mV s−1 in the CV test, and 0.5 A g−1
to ∼15 mV s−1. Fig. 2a shows the chrono-voltage curves of
selected cycles carried out at 2.0 A g−1 for a typical cell of which
the electrodes contain 7.2% binder (i.e., the 7% cell). From the
charge branches of these curves, it is clear that the charge stor-
age capacity (Q) progressively decreases with increasing cycle
number. The capacity was found to lose 29.4% of its initial value
after 1000 cycles (Fig. 3). Concurrently, the IR drop was found to
gradually increase with cycle number, suggesting continuously
increasing resistance along the electron conduction pathways
within the electrodes. The same trend has been observed for sev-
eral cells from different batches, although there are small vari-
ations in the exact extents of fading. The symmetric cells were
dissembled at the end of cycling, and the electrodes were then
individually measured for their capacities with a three-electrode
configuration. The results showed that the electrodes exhibited
similar extents of fading and there was no regular pattern indi-
cating either of the electrodes in a cell faded faster than the other.

of the electrode, and they can be accounted for by a transmission-
line model that contains distributedRC network as schematically
shown in Fig. 4b [11–13]. In the generalized sense of the model,
the resistances (R) sum up the pore resistances and the electric
resistances along the solid conductive matrix over different seg-
ments within an electrode. The electric resistance is determined
to a greater extent by contact resistances between the grains than
by the bulk resistances within the grains. For the RC network
having infinite numbers of equal-valued Rs and Cs, the line has
a theoretical inclination of 45◦. On the other hand, it can readily
be demonstrated that the angle deviates from the ideal value for
variedRs andCs. The results shown in Fig. 5a and b indicates that
the overall resistance of this distributed RC network increases
more than eight times, from ∼0.7 to 5.8 , after cycling at the
current rate of 2.0 A g−1.
On the other hand, Fig. 6 compares the Nyquist plots before
and after cycling at 0.5 A g−1. Compared with those at 2.0 A g−1
(Fig. 5a), two major differences can be noticed. The plots of the
low current-rate show a large increase in the semi-circle resis-
tance that is associated with the charge-transfer process (Fig. 4a)
at the solid-electrolyte interface after cycling. In contrast, there is
much less change in the transmission-model network resistance.
Capacity fading of MnO2·nH2O EC has mostly been
attributed to dissolution of the oxide film into the electrolyte
[7–9]. The electrolyte solutions of the 7% cells after cycling
have been analyzed for Mn content by ICP analysis. As shown in
Table 1, Mn dissolution has indeed been detected for either low-
or high-rate condition, but the amount of dissolution has always
been less than 0.5%. On the one hand, the amount of dissolution
is too low to account for the extent of capacity fading in either
case (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the cell which exhibits more

capacity fading at the higher current-rate in fact shows smaller
amount dissolution. These results may indicate that the disso-
lution mechanism cannot be a significant cause to the capacity
fading in the present study. Indeed, it also fails to explain the
remarkable effect of the binder content in suppressing the fading.
Our previous study [10] on the pseudocapacitance mecha-
nism of MnO2·nH2O in aqueous alkali salts solutions has shown
that the mechanism involves charge-transfer at Mn-ion sites
balanced by bulk insertion/extraction of the solution cations
into/from the oxide structure. The reaction can be expressed
as:
Mn(IV)O2·nH2O + δe− + δ(1 − f ) H3O+ + δf M+
↔ (H3O)δ(1−f )Mδf [Mn(III)δMn(IV)1−δ]O2·nH2O,
where M+ is alkali cation. In the case of aqueous NaCl elec-
trolyte, f is nearly zero. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction
study showed reversible lattice expansion/contraction (∼2.5%
over 1.0 V) of MnO2·nH2O crystallites upon cycling [10]. Cyclic
dimensional variation of the active components within an elec-
trode has long been known to have significant impact on the
stability of electrode structure upon cycling. The present data
indeed give strong support to the notion of mechanical failure
of electrode structure arising from such dimensional variations.
The effect of cyclic volumetric expansion/contraction of the
oxide particles on the electrode structure can be envisioned as
follows. During the expansion phase of a cycle, the particles,
either oxide or C, are pushing one another, leading to extensive
relative motion among particles, accompanied with macroscopic
expansion of the entire electrode overlay. The binder connect-
ing between the particles is simultaneously stretched in response
to the particle motion. During the contraction phase, the parti-
cles tend to move back to the original positions, and the binder is
relaxed. Upon cyclic stretching/relaxation, the binder may grad-
ually become ruptured, fatigued, or mostly likely de-bonded
with the particles, causing the electrode structure to become
loose and the particles to lose electric contact between one
another. A direct consequence will be increasingly deteriorating
electric contacts between particles, leading to capacity reduction
and increased RC network resistance.
Dahn et al. [14] once tested the mechanical properties of a
PVDF (20 wt.%)-bound carbon black electrode, and showed a
macroscopic elongation at break of ∼4.5% for the electrode at
the strain rate of 1% min−1. Given that the present electrodes
contained merely one-third of the amount of PVDF (7 wt.%),
it is reasonable to anticipate mechanical failure to occur with a
macroscopic elongation far less than 4.5%.
The mechanical failure mechanism is also consistent with
other observations. A higher current-rate introduces a greater
strain rate and/or non-homogeneity in stress distribution, result-
ing in a greater extent of destruction. This may explain the
observation that capacity fading increases with increasing C/D
current-rate. On the other hand, using a greater amount of binder
strengthens the overall binding between particles, and hence
effectively suppresses capacity fading as observed (Fig. 3). Fur-
thermore, the deteriorating electric contacts between particles
can introduce pronounced distributed RC network equivalently

99.3%) with a Mn(VII)/Mn(II) molar ratio of 2:3 at room tem-
perature. After being thoroughly washed with de-ionized water,
the particles were finally heated at 200 ◦C in air for 1 h. As
determined by nitrogen adsorption, the resulting powder con-
tains primarily meso-pores with pore volume of ∼0.25 cc g−1
and a BET surface area of ∼191 m2 g−1.
To prepare the electrode, slurry containing the oxide pow-
der, acetylene black (AB; VULCAN XC72), and polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVdF, Aldrich) was cast into film on Ti foils, and
finally dried at 120 ◦C for 6 h in vacuum. On the dry basis, the
oxide to AB ratio was fixed at 7:3, while the binder, which used
N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, Mitsubishi Chemical) as the dis-
persing solvent, had a weight composition of 15% in the final
electrode. Every electrode has a dimension of 1 cm × 1 cm and
contains approximately 1.7 mg of dried overlay materials. The
symmetric cell assembly consists of two electrodes with the
overlays face-to-face separated by a silicone rubber spacer which
is 3 mm thick.
The polymer component, PAAK, for forming the gel is used
as purchased (CAS #25608-12-2. Aldrich), and its chemical for-
mula can be expressed as (CH2–CHCOOR)n . Dissolution
of 1 g of the polymer in the presently used deionized water
(10 cc) changes the solution pH from 7.1 to 6.2. Estimation based
on the dissociation equilibrium constant of either acetic acid
(pKa = 4.76) or propanoic acid (pKa = 4.89) suggests that >95%
of H+ has been ion-exchanged by K+ at the R-site in the formula
shown above. For electrochemical characterization, the symmet-
ric MnO2-cell was first immersed in 10 cc of 1 M KCl aqueous
solution, and 1g of PAAK was subsequently added into the solu-
tion with stirring at room temperature. The resulting polymer gel
electrolyte consists of 9 wt.% PAAK, 6.7 wt.% KCl, 84.3 wt.%
H2O.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded by an elec-
trochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30). The average
specific capacitance of the electrodes was calculated from the
CV curve as follows:
Cavg = 2 × Q(w × V )−1 = 2
(∫
I dV (S × w × V )−1
)
where Q is the total amount of charge accumulated over a
potential window V of a symmetric cell; w, the mass of active
material in one electrode; I, the current; and S, the potential
scan-rate. A factor of 2 is introduced because the capacitance
exhibited by a symmetric cell is one half of the capacitance
of each electrode. An AUTOLAB frequency response ana-
lyzer (AUTOLAB, Eco Chemie PGSTAT30) was employed
for obtaining the electrochemical impedance spectra with the
frequency range from 5 mHz to 60 kHz and a voltage ampli-
tude of 10 mV. Electrolyte conductivity was determined from
the impedance spectrum. Chrono-potential test was performed
between 0and 0.8 V at current density of 2 mA cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
Upon introducing the polymer into the KCl solution, the
polymer swelled and the solution became increasingly viscous
with time and eventually became rigid, showing no fluidity

chemical capacitor cell in a container in an upside-down position, showing no
fluidity.
(Fig. 1). The voltammograms acquired with a liquid electrolyte
(1 M KCl) and the gel electrolyte are shown in Fig. 2a and b,
respectively. First, it can be seen that both electrolytes gave
nearly rectangular current profiles, characteristic of a capaci-
tor. Secondly, under the same scan rate, the gel electrolyte cell
always exhibited higher capacitances than the solution one. For
instance, by subtracting the contribution from the carbon com-
ponent (∼3.0 F g−1-composite), it can be shown that the oxide
possesses a specific capacitance of 168 F g−1 in the gel elec-
trolyte under the scan rate of 4 mV s−1 at room temperature
(∼27 ◦C), and 116 F g−1 in the liquid electrolyte. The chrono-
potential curves acquired under constant current density in both
electrolytes are shown in Fig. 3. Again, the linear line profile in
both cases confirmed the nearly ideal capacitive behaviors.
Fig. 4 summarizes the effect of CV scan rate on the specific
capacitance. Both electrolyte systems showed decreasing capac-
itance with increasing scan rate following a semi-logarithm
correlation. However, the gel electrolyte system shows a slightly
greater decreasing rate. Nevertheless, the specific capacitances
of the gel electrolyte remain higher than those of the aqueous one
throughout the range up to 200 mV s−1. In the gel electrolyte, the
oxide electrode retains a specific capacitance of 101 F g−1 even
at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1, which corresponds to a specific
power of ∼16 kW kg−1 at 0.8 V.

pseudocapacitance mechanism of MnO2·nH2O EC has shown
that the pseudocapacitance involves competitive intercalation
of oxonium (H3O+) ions and the alkaline cations into the oxide
matrix, and that the electrolyte containing the alkaline cation
intercalating to a less extent generally gives a higher specific
capacitance. Increasing K+ concentration in the present study is
expected to increase the extent of K+ intercalation, and accord-
ingly the specific capacitance falls. The slight enhancement in
capacitance observed at 200 mV s−1 in Fig. 5 apparently results
from improved solution conductivity, which becomes increas-
ingly significant at high rates.
In order to understand the nature of the capacitance
enhancement by the gel electrolyte, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopic analysis was conducted. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist
plots for the liquid and gel electrolytes, respectively. The plots
show similar fundamental components characteristic of a porous
pseudocapacitor as depicted by Conway [20]. The semi-circle
appearing within the high-frequency range in the plots can be
accounted for by a parallel RC equivalent-circuit unit of which
R corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance of the pseudo-
capacitance process and C, the double-layer capacitance at the
electrode/electrolyte interface. The semi-circle is followed by a
short segment that is inclined by nearly ∼45◦. This segment is
a signature of the porous nature of the electrode, and it can be
accounted for by a transmission-line equivalent-circuit model
that contains a RC network to sum up the distributed pore resis-
tances. Finally, the steep line toward the low frequency region
arises from the pseudocapacitance.
The similarity in the charge transfer (semi-circle) resistance
(1.0–1.5 ) may suggest that the electrochemical processes
taking place at the oxide/electrolyte interface are essentially
unchanged in these electrolytes. Major difference resides in the
significant reduction in the distributed pore solution resistance
(the 45◦-inclined segment) for the gel electrolyte. The bulk elec-
trolyte resistances, determined from the intersection of Z′ and
the front edge of the semi-circle, are 1.5 and 2.0 , correspond-
ing to conductivities of 2.0 × 10−1 and 1.5 × 10−1 S cm−1, for
the liquid and gel electrolytes, respectively. That is, the presence
of the polymer component only reduces the bulk conductivity,
as expected. Therefore, the reduction in the pore resistance in
the gel electrolyte is not related to the difference in solution con-
ductivity. We conjecture two possible causes, which may relate
the pore resistance reduction to the capacitance enhancement.
It is known that the use of hydrophobic binder, such as PVdF
in the present study, reduces wetting compatibility between the
aqueous electrolyte and the oxide electrode matrix, often result-
ing in pores within the electrode interior not fully wetted by the
electrolyte solution. The hydrophobic nature of the polymeric
component in the gel electrolyte may improve the compatibility
between the electrode matrix and the electrolyte. As a result,
in the gel electrolyte, the pores are better penetrated by the
electrolyte, and the overall cell capacitance, hence increases
due to reduced un-wetted areas. Alternatively, the swelling pro-
cess of the polymer molecules within the electrode interior
could open ajar closed pores that are originally not accessi-
ble to the electrolyte solution. This also results in increase in
the overall cell capacitance. In both cases, because the pores are
increasingly uniformly filled with the electrolyte, and the overall
pore solution resistance is hence reduced. While these conjec-
tures account for the impedance and capacitance data, more
elaborated research is underway to further clarify these issues.
Although the bulk conductivity, 1.5 × 10−1 S cm−1, of the gel
electrolyte is 25% lower than that of the liquid electrolyte, it is
still much higher than those (<10−2 S cm−1) typically associated
with polymeric solid electrolytes.
Finally, it should be pointed out that the presence of the
polymer component does not impose negative effect on leakage
current. For example, Fig. 7 shows the change in current neces-
sary to maintain the cell at 0.8 V. The leakage current in the gel
electrolyte is in fact lower than that in 1 M KCl liquid electrolyte.
Significant reduction in leakage current when liquid electrolyte
is replaced with a gel one has also been noted in the RuO2-
based ECs by Wada et al. [21] and Ni-metal hydride batteries
by Iwakura et al. [22]. The mechanisms of self-discharge for
ECs reported in the literature mainly include the shuttle reaction
of impurity metal ions in electrolytes, short-circuit of electrode
materials (e.g. carbon) penetrating the separator, and so on. In

by a higher glass transition temperature, Tg, of the copolymer. In
addition, it reduces the density of carboxylate groups along the
polymer chain, which are known to have strong afﬁnity toward
MnO2 surface [13,14]. Furthermore, the presence of amino groups
changes the pH value of the electrolyte. The interplays between
these variations and the electrochemical characteristics of the oxide
ECs were studied. Finally, the cause to the enhanced capacitance as
previously observed for the PAAK GPE [12] and for PAAK-co-PAAM
in the present study was investigated.
2. Experimental
MnO2·nH2O particles were synthesized by mixing aqueous solu-
tions of KMnO4 (Nacalai, 99.3%) and MnSO4 (J.T. Baker, 99.3%) with
a Mn(VII)/Mn(II) molar ratio of 2:3. After being thoroughly washed
with de-ionized water, the particles were dried at 200 ◦C in air
for 1 h. As determined by nitrogen adsorption, the resulting pow-
der contained primarily meso-pores with a total pore volume of
0.25 cm3 g−1 and a BET surface area of 191 m2 g−1. To prepare thick-
ﬁlm electrodes, slurry containing the oxide powder, carbon black
(CB; Vulcan XC72), and polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF, Aldrich)
was pasted onto a Ti foil, and the resulting electrode was ﬁnally
dried at 120 ◦C for 6 h in vacuum. On the dry basis, the oxide to
CB ratio was ﬁxed at 7:3, while the binder (PVDF), which used N-
methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, Mitsubishi Chemical) as the dispersing
solvent, had a weight composition of 15% in the ﬁnal electrode. Such
a high binder content (15 wt%) employed in the present study was
intended to give sufﬁcient binding strength to minimize capaci-
tance fading due to deterioration of electrode structure [15]. The
electrodes typically had a dimension of 1 cm × 1 cm and contained
1.02 (±0.03) mg of active materials including the oxide and CB par-
ticles.
In order to study the effect of ﬁlm-thickness on electrode capac-
itance, another two sets of electrodes having different amounts of
active materials were also prepared for comparison. Firstly, a set
of electrodes containing ∼0.25 mg active materials were prepared
by the same pasting method as described above but with diluted
slurry. Secondly, a set of thin-ﬁlm type of electrodes was prepared
by electroplating method. The plating solution was 0.25 M MnSO4
aqueous solution with pH = 5.0, and plating was performed using a
Ti foil as the substrate under constant potential [5]. The electrode
area was 1 cm2 and the deposited oxide mass was ∼6.5g. The
amount of oxide in this case was determined by inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) analysis.
The MnO2·nH2O electrodes were characterized mainly in a
symmetric-cell conﬁguration except for the in situ X-ray absorp-
tion near-edge structure (XANES) analysis, where a three-electrode
conﬁguration was adopted. The symmetric-cell conﬁguration con-
sisted of two electrodes with the active-material overlays facing
each other and separated by a silicone rubber spacer which was
3 mm thick. In the three-electrode conﬁguration, on the other hand,
a platinum counter-electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode
(0.197 V versus NHE at 25 ◦C) were used in conjunction with a tested
MnO2·nH2O working electrode.
The two polymers employed for making the GPEs are PAAK
(Aldrich, CAS# 25608-12-2) and PAAK-co-PAAM (Aldrich, CAS#
31212-13-2), of which the chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1.
Both polymers are partially cross-linked, and have been used as
received. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry, the
Tg of the PAAK polymer is 85.3 ◦C and that of PAAK-co-PAAM is
140.4 ◦C.
For electrochemical characterizations, the electrodes were ﬁrst
immersed in 10 cm3 solution of 1 M KCl, and 1 g of polymer was
subsequently added into the solution. The resulting polymer gel
electrolyte consisted of 9 wt% polymer, 6.7 wt% KCl, and 84.3 wt%

H2O. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted with
an electrochemical analyzer (AUTOLAB, Eco Chemie PGSTAT30).
The capacitance of the electrode was determined from the voltam-
mograms according to the following equation:
Cavg = aQ
V
(1)
where Cavg is the average speciﬁc capacity, Q is the total amount of
charge accumulated over a scanned potential (or voltage) window
V, and a is equal to 2 for the symmetric-cell conﬁguration and 1
for the three-electrode conﬁguration.
The electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained from
frequency response analysis (AUTOLAB, Eco Chemie PGSTAT30)
with the frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 60 kHz and a voltage
amplitude of 10 mV. Electrolyte conductivity was determined from
impedance spectrum. For XANES analysis, the spectra in ﬂuores-
cence mode were recorded at selected potentials during the course
of CV scan at the beam-line 17C1 of the National Synchrotron Radi-
ation Research Center in Taiwan. For the in situ XANES study, CV
ran at a scan-rate of 4 mV s−1, and the scan was stopped at each
selected potential for 25 min for data collection.
3. Results and discussion
The cyclic voltammograms of the symmetric cells containing
various electrolytes are compared in Fig. 2. All the CV curves
exhibit nearly rectangular proﬁles, indicating nearly ideal capacitor
behaviors in all cases. The electrode capacitances were calculated
according to Eq. (1) from data shown in Fig. 2. The contributions of
the CB component (3.0–3.3 F g−1-active material) under different
conditions were determined from the CV curves of pure CB elec-
trodes (not shown) and were subtracted from the overall electrode
capacitances to give the capacitances of the MnO2·nH2O compo-
nent. Fig. 3a plots the speciﬁc capacitance of MnO2·nH2O thus
calculated as a function of scan rate for different cells. As shown,
both GPE cells exhibit higher capacitances than the LE cell, with
the PAAK cell having the highest capacitances, under all tested
scan rates. At 4 mV s−1, the speciﬁc capacitance of MnO2·nH2O is
154 F g−1 for the LE cell, 253 F g−1 for the PAAK cell, and 235 F g−1
for the PAAK-co-PAAM cell. There are respectively 64% and 53%
increase in speciﬁc capacitance for the PAAK and PAAK-co-PAAM

PAAK and PAAK-co-PAAM GPE cells, respectively. The enhance-
ments of capacitance are 100% and 90%, respectively.
Fig. 3c compares the speciﬁc capacitances for the electroplated
electrodes in different electrolytes. Further increases in both the
absolute speciﬁc capacitance of the oxide and the capacitance
enhancement are observed. For instance, an enhancement by 127%
(from 220 F g−1 to 501 F g−1) for the scan rate of 4 mV s−1 has been
observed for the electroplated electrode in PAAK, as compared with
100% and 64% enhancement for the thinner and thicker pasted elec-
trodes (Fig. 3a and b). The data may suggest that the capacitance
enhancement phenomenon is insensitive to electrode preparation
method. Rather, they show that a greater capacitance enhancement
in the GPEs may result from an increase in the proportion of the
oxide surface accessible to electrolyte, and they therefore suggest
that the oxide/electrolyte interface plays an important role in the
capacitance enhancement.
Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots measured at 0.0 V for all the
symmetric cells. The plots show similar fundamental components
characteristic of a porous pseudocapacitor as depicted by Conway
[16]. The semi-circle appearing within the high-frequency range
in the plots can be accounted for by an R//C equivalent-circuit unit
consisting of a double-layer capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte
interface in parallel with a charge-transfer resistance (Rct) through
the pseudocapacitance process. The steep line toward the low fre-
quency region arises from the pseudocapacitance. The intersection
of the forefront of the semi-circle with the x-axis gives the ionic
resistance, Ri, of the electrolyte, while the span of the semi-circle
along the x-axis gives Rct. Accordingly, as listed in Table 1, the Ri
value follows the order of LE < PAAK GPE < PAA-co-PAAM GPE, and
the Rct value shows the same trend. The ionic conductivity () of
electrolyte can be calculated by the following equation:
 ≡ l
Ri × A
(2)
where l is the distance between the two electrodes (3 mm) and A
is the electrode surface area. The ionic conductivity of the LE is
2.80 × 10−1 S cm−1, while those of PAAK and PAAK-co-PAAM GPEs
are 2.11 × 10−1 and 1.58 × 10−1 S cm−1, respectively.

Cycling stability was tested by conducting CV at 20 mV s−1. Fig. 5
plots the speciﬁc capacitance versus cycle number for all three cells.
No capacitance fading was observed for either the LE cell or the
PAA-co-PAAM GPE cell after 3000 cycles. On the other hand, the
capacitance of the PAAK GPE cell started to decrease after 500 cycles
and exhibited 32% capacitance loss from the initial value after 3000
cycles. However, it is interesting to note that the cycling stability of
the PAAK cell can be greatly improved by increasing the pH value of
the electrolyte. For instance, as shown in Fig. 5, increasing the elec-
trolyte pH to 6.6 (with addition of KOH), the fading was remarkably
reduced to less than 10% after 3000 cycles.
Figs. 6 and 7 compare the impedance data acquired after selected
cycles for the two GPE cells. For the PAAK-co-PAAM GPE cell, the
Nyquist plots (Fig. 6) show only a slight increase in Rct with increas-
ing cycle number. The impedance data of the LE cell (not shown)
exhibit basically the same variations as the PAAK-co-PAAM GPE cell.
In contrast, in the case of the PAAK GPE cell, which exhibited exten-
sive fading, the Nyquist plot (Fig. 7) ﬁrst shows a signiﬁcant increase
in Rct after 1000 cycles. Subsequently, a second semi-circle with a
much larger Rct than the ﬁrst one emerges in the low frequency
region after 2000 cycles. The development of this new semi-circle
may suggest the emergence of a new interface of high resistance
during the cycling.
The open-circuit potential of the MnO2·nH2O electrode in the
PAAK GPE is 0.55 V (all the potential values mentioned hereafter
are relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Accordingly, for

trode thickness with the oxide particles within the top portion of
the electrode subjected to a greater extent of charging/discharging
than those within the bottom portion.
Although no in situ XANES measurement was carried out on the
PAAK-co-PAAM GPE cell, similar phenomena, namely higher Mn K-
edge energies and greater variations in Mn-ion valence than those
in the LE, are anticipated.
PAAK-based polymers are known to be strongly adsorbed at
MnO2 surface over a wide range of solution pH [13,14]. Within
the pH range (5.2–7.2) associated with the different electrolytes
in the present study, the carboxylic groups are mostly dissociated
(−CO2−), and the surface of MnO2 is negatively charged (pH of zero-
charge point is ∼4.0). Thus, the interaction between the carboxylate
groups and the oxide surface is expected to be nonelectrostatic,
but mostly likely via speciﬁc interaction to form surface complexes
[13,14]. It is inferred that the formation of strong bonding between
the electron-withdrawing carboxylate groups of the GPEs and the
surface Mn ions of the oxide particles may be the main cause to
the higher Mn valence and greater valence variation exhibited by
the MnO2·nH2O electrode in the GPEs. Such an inference is sup-
ported by other observations. Firstly, the capacitance enhancement
is higher in the PAAK GPE than in the PAAK-co-AAM GPE, as the for-
mer has a higher density of the carboxylate groups. Secondly, the
capacitance enhancement increases with an increase in the acces-
sible oxide/electrolyte interfacial surface area, as demonstrated in
Fig. 3a–c. It thus suggests that the oxide/electrolyte interfacial inter-
action does play an important role in the capacitance enhancement.
The bonding nature of the surface complexes, however, is yet to be
determined.
The ionic conductivity of the PAAK-co-PMMA GPE was found
to be lower than that of the PAAK GPE, as shown in Table 1.
Theoretically, the ionic conductivity of a solid or a gel polymer elec-
trolyte depends on the segmental motion of polymer chain. An ionic
motion within polymer electrolyte is accompanied by the confor-
mation change of the polymer chains. PAAK-co-PAAM has a higher
Tg than PAAK, suggesting that the structure of the former is more
rigid and hence less ﬂexible in motion than the latter. It is thus
anticipated that the motion of ions within the PAAK GPE will be
easier than within the PAAK-co-PAAM GPE. Accordingly, the latter
exhibits a lower ionic conductivity than the former.
The impedance data also indicate that both GPEs give higher
charge-transfer resistances than the LE. This may result from the
strong adsorption of carboxylate groups of the GPEs on the oxide
surface. In addition, in the case of PAAK-co-PAAM GPE, the amino
groups are protonated (–NH3+). The presence of these positively-
charged functional groups is expected to further facilitate the
adsorption of PAAK-co-PAAM on the MnO2 surface via electrostatic
attraction. While such an interaction may have no inﬂuence on the
valence of the Mn ions, it could further impede the charge-transfer
process at the oxide surface. This may explain why the PAAK-co-
PAAM gives the highest Rct.
Capacitance fading was also an important issue in recent
research on MnO2·nH2O supercapacitors [15,21,22]. Experimental
evidences have shown that failure in electrode structure may be the
main cause to the fading at high current densities (e.g., >2 A g−1)
[15], while electrochemical deterioration of the active oxide phase
contributes most of the fading under low current densities [21,22],
as encountered in the present study. In particular, there appears to
be a general consensus that the irreversible formation of superﬁcial
Mn+3 oxide species, such as Mn2O3 and MnOOH, on the electrode
is the key factor to the fading taking place at potentials below the
OCP of the oxide electrode, i.e., at the negative electrode of a sym-
metric cell. Reduction in speciﬁc capacitance has been attributed
either to the electrochemically inactive nature of these reduced Mn
oxide species [22] or to the loss of Mn via disproportionation reac-
tion of Mn+3 to form Mn+4 and soluble Mn+2 ions [21]. As proton
participates in the superﬁcial reduction reaction of Mn+4, fading is
therefore facilitated by increasing proton concentration. The accel-
erated fading experienced by the PAAK GPE cell probably arises
from the fact that this electrolyte has the lowest pH, i.e., the high-
est proton concentration. However, the cycling stability of the PAAK
GPE cell was remarkably improved by raising the electrolyte pH (as
shown in Fig. 5).
4. Conclusions
In the present work, MnO2·nH2O supercapacitors with PAAK
and PAAK-co-PAAM GPEs have been characterized for their electro-
chemical performance. Compared with the LE cell having the same
salt concentration, the GPE cells exhibited remarkable enhance-
ment (>50%) in speciﬁc capacitance of the oxide electrode, and the
extent of the enhancement increases with increasing amount of
the carboxylic groups in the polymers as well as with increasing
oxide/electrolyte interfacial area. in situ XANES analysis indicates
that the oxide electrodes possess higher Mn-ion valence and expe-
rience greater valence variations upon charging/discharging in the
GPEs over the same potential range. Copolymerization of PAAK with
PAAM greatly improves the cycling stability of the PAAK-based GPE,
and the improvement can be attributed to the alkaline nature of the
amino groups.

Experimental
MnFe2O4 nanocrystallites were synthesized as follows. MnSO4 was dissolved
along with FeCl3 with a stoichiometric ratio of 1: 2 in 1 M HCl aqueous solution with
bubbling N2, and this was followed by adding the predetermined amount of conductive
acetylene black (AB, VULCANXC72, Cabot Corporation). The slurry solution is then
added into the solution that contains 1.5 M NaOH at 40 oC under vigorous stirring. Black
precipitate was immediately formed upon mixing. The precipitate was finally dried in air
at 50 oC, followed by calcination at 350 oC for 2 h in 1% H2/99% N2. The final powders
have a weight ratio of the oxide to AB ~ 7:3. LiMn2O4 powder, on the other hand, was
used as received (Sedema).
MnFe2O4 electrodes were made of the composite powder, polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVdF) in 10 wt% and Al foil as the current collector. LiMn2O4 electrodes, on the other
hand, consist of the oxide particles (88 wt%), conductive carbon additives (6 wt%) and
PVdF (6 wt%). Characterization of the MnFe2O4 electrode, either cycled against a Li-foil
or another MnFe2O4 electrode, were carried out in coin-cells. The characterization of the
LiMn2O4 asymmetric cell was carried out with a three-electrode configuration in the Al
“coffee-bag”cell, as shown in Fig. 1, where a Li electrode was used as the reference
electrode. All the cells were assembled in a dry room where the dew point was
maintained at -40 ~ -45 oC. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotential curves were
recorded by an electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30).

Abstract
Long-term electrochemical behaviors of hydrated MnO2 electrochemical capacitor (EC) 
electrode in alkali chloride (KCl(aq)) electrolyte have been studied by using potential 
cycling for thousands of cycles within different potential windows spanning from 0.8 V 
(versus Ag/AgCl(aq)) to varied lower-end potentials below the open-circuit potential. 
Three potential ranges resulting in different cycling behaviors of the oxide EC have been 
identified. Range I: cycling above 0.2 V results in no change in either microstructure or 
surface chemistry of the oxide electrode, and no capacitance reduction has been observed. 
Range II: cycling down to 0.0 V leads to extensive morphological reconstruction and 
limited reduction of surface Mn ions, while the electrode capacitance remains stable. 
Range III: cycling with lower-potential end below 0.0 V results in obvious capacitance 
reduction, along with different morphological reconstruction and Mn reduction from 
those in Range II. For each selected lower-end potential in Range III, the capacitance 
descends to a plateau within first thousand cycles, and the extent of the capacitance 
reduction increases as the lower-end potential decreases. A lower operation potential
limit of -0.1 V is recommended for the negative electrode of symmetric MnO2 ECs, in 
terms of maximizing cell specific energy and maintaining good cycle stability.

phase changes under reducing potentials. This type of fading causes capacitance 
reduction mainly in the negative electrode of a symmetric EC cell. The most often 
referred fading mechanism is the dissolution mechanism [13,14], which attributes
capacitance reduction to dissolution of partially reduced MnO2 via disproportionation 
reaction of trivalent Mn oxide or oxy-hydroxide species, such as 
Mn2O3(s) + H
+  Mn+2(aq) + MnO2(s) + OH
or 
2MnO(OH)  Mn+2(aq) + MnO2(s) +2 OH.
However, in most cases [e.g., ref. 16] the amounts of Mn ions detected in the electrolytes 
were too small to account for the surface loss that would correspond to the extents of 
reported capacitance loss [16]. On the other hand, Nam et al. [17] recently ascribed the 
fading to irreversible formation of inactive Mn oxide species of lower Mn valences on 
electrode surface, based on in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis. Both 
proposed mechanisms imply that the electrochemical cyclability is closely related to 
physicochemical feature evolution, such as morphological, chemical and structural 
changes, in MnO2 electrodes during cycling. Indeed, MnO2 electrode has also been 
shown to exhibit remarkable morphological reconstruction when cycled under certain 
potentials [18]. However, the interplay between the physicochemical feature evolution 
and corresponding long-term electrochemical response of MnO2 electrodes has yet been 
clarified.
The second category of the fading attributes the capacitance reduction to the 
mechanical failure of electrode structure caused by cyclic volumetric variations of the 
constituent oxide particles upon cycling [16]. In-situ X-ray diffraction study has

composition of 14%. Such a high binder content employed in the present study was 
intended to give sufficient binding strength to minimize capacitance fading due to 
deterioration of electrode structure [16].
Electrochemical characterizations, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were carried out with a beaker-type 
electrochemical cell. The cell was equipped with a working electrode, a platinum foil
counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl (EG&G, 197 mV vs. NHE at 25 oC)
reference electrode. All the potentials mentioned hereafter are based on this reference 
electrode. The electrolyte was aqueous 1M KCl with pH= 6, while the potential scan rate 
was fixed at 50 mV/s. Potential scan has been started and ended at the lower-end 
potential, unless otherwise noted. The capacitance of the electrode was determined from 
the voltammograms according to the following equation:
dVsIV -1-1avgC (1)
where Cavg is the average specific capacity, ΔV is the scanned potential window, I is 
current, and s is voltage scan rate. The tests were carried out on an electrochemical 
analyzer (Eco Chemie PGSTAT30). Subsequent to cycling, the electrodes were washed 
with deionized water and dried in a drying cabinet at room temperature prior to scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.
Surface morphology was examined by a field-emission SEM (FE-SEM LEO-1730). XPS 
analysis employed an Al K X-ray source operated at 15 kV and 100 W, and used a beam 
size of 400 micrometer and pass energy of 20 eV for spectrum acquisition. Sputtering 
gun was operated at 3 kV and 1 μA with a sputtering area of 2 mm × 2 mm and sputtering 
time of 10 sec.

The long-term behavior of MnO2 electrode was thus investigated over the
potential ranges that respectively cover the three reducing potential ranges indexed in Fig. 
1a. The electrodes are denoted hereafter as S(x, 0.8), where x indicates the lower-end 
potential of the scanned range. For instance, electrode S(0.2, 0.8) was cycled within the 
potential range of 0.2 and 0.8 V. 
3.1 XPS Surface Analysis of the Electrodes
The cycled ( 3000 cycles) electrodes are subjected to XPS analysis for
determining the oxidation state of Mn located at the electrode surfaces. Fig. 2 shows the 
acquired Mn 3s and O 1s spectra, while the associated data are summarized in Table 1. 
The Mn 3s core level spectra show peak splitting due to the parallel spin coupling of the 
3s electron with the 3d electron during the photoelectron ejection [20-22]. A linear 
correlation between the energy separation (E) between these two peaks and the valence 
of Mn has been suggested [20-22]. By reference to the E vales for MnO (5.79 V), 
Mn3O4 (5.50V), Mn2O3 (5.41 V), and MnO2 4.78 V) [20], respectively, the valences of 
Mn ions at different electrode surfaces are estimated. As shown in Table 1, the Mn 
valence of the fresh electrode is +3.7.
The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2a; Table 1) showed a sharp peak centered at ~530 eV 
and a broad peak of lower intensity extending over higher binding energy range. The 
former may be attributed to O in the Mn-O-Mn bonding configuration, while the latter to 
the combination of Mn-O-H and Mn-O-H2. (Attempts of further de-convolution of the 
broad peak into two sub-peaks prove unsuccessful.) As shown, significant amounts of 
Mn-O-H and Mn-O-H2 exist in the fresh electrode, revealing the hydrous nature of the

cycling began at the open-circuit potential (OCP; ~0.4 V) and ended at OCP. The same 
Mn valence was detected. It means that the detected redcution of Mn valence on the 
cycled electrodes are permanent and not affected by the starting/ending potentials of the 
cycling processes.
3.2 SEM analysis
The electrodes before and after CV test were also examined by scanning electron 
microscope to reveal the morphological differences. Fig. 3a shows that the fresh electrode 
contains nano-flakes of the oxide and rounded carbon black particles. A comparison of 
Fig. 3a and 3b reveals no obvious change in morphologies, indicating that the
morphology of the MnO2 electrode is no significantly influenced by the cycling within 
the potential covering Range I. In contrast, the SEM micrograph (Fig. 3c) reveals that the 
initial nano-flake structure has evolved into a petal-like morphology after cycling in 
Range II. The curved petals are packed with void and formed a macroporous open 
structure. On the other hand, the morphology of the cycled S(-0.2, 0.8) electrode changes 
to needle-tipped flakes (Fig. 3d).
3.3 Electrochemical performances
3.3.1 Potential range: 0.2 V ~ 0.8 V
Fig. 4a shows the cycle performance of the S(0.2, 0.8) electrode. The capacitances 
have been normalized with respective to the capacitance of the second cycle, of which the 
specific capacitance is 71.5 F/g (at 50 mV/sec). The specific capacitance of the electrode
is in general rather stable. Fig. 4b presents the CVs of selected cycles. All the curves

electrode itself. Calculation based on the voltammograms also showed that the total 
charge accumulated during the cathodic scan (QC ) is always higher than that during the 
anodic scan (QA ) for each cycle, and the difference increases slowly with cycle number, 
ranging from nearly zero during the initial 500 cycles to 4.6% of QC at the 3000th cycle. 
The data indicate that the redox couple below 0.2 V is partially reversible, and there is 
clearly net reduction of the MnO2 electrode. This is consistent with the XPS data (Table 
1), which show that the valence of Mn of the electrode surface has reduced from 3.7 to 
2.7 after cycling. Mn3O4, which has a Mn valence of 2.67, is likely to be predominant 
resulting sub-oxide on the electrode surface. It is noted that bulk Mn3O4 has been shown 
to transform into layered MnO2 having high specific capacitance when subjected to 
potential cycling within the potential range similar to the present study [22]. This may be 
associated with the partial reversible nature of the reduction tail below 0.0 V.
Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots measured after selected cycles. The plots show 
similar line profiles, which are composed of a semicircle at high frequencies (> 66 Hz), a 
straight line inclined at a constant phase at intermediate frequencies (66~1.22 Hz) and an 
almost vertical capacitive line at low frequencies (< 1.22 Hz). It is generally accepted [23] 
that the semicircle is mainly associated with the charge-transfer reaction at the 
electrode/electrolyte interface, and the diameter of the semicircle gives the associated 
charge-transfer resistance. The mid-frequency region is, on the other hand, associated 
with the semi-infinite diffusion of electrolyte’s cations in the electrode [24], and the 
projection of this segment to the x-axis gives the associated diffusion resistance. The 
capacitive line in the blocking region is related to the accumulation of cations at the 
impermeable interface under the finite diffusion condition [2, 25]. As shown, there was

enhancement during the initial cycles. In addition, the growing intensity of the partially 
reversible redox couple between 0.0 and 0.2V can also contribute the rise in the 
capacitance. On the other hand, the irreversible surface reduction of Mn oxide results in 
surface passivation, causing increasing charge-transfer resistance and hence capacitance 
reduction after longer cycles. 
3.3.3 Potential ranges:  -0.1 V ~ 0.8 V
Fig. 7a summarizes the capacitance variation versus cycle number for three 
different cycling potential windows, including (-0.3 V ~ 0.8 V), (-0.2 V ~ 0.8 V) and (-
0.1 V ~ 0.8 V). One common feature among these curves is that the capacitance 
decreases over a certain period of initial cycles and then levels off at a rather stable value 
for at least another several thousand cycles. This trend suggests a scenario that the 
structure and/or composition of the electrode evolve toward a new stable state during 
initial period of cycling in response to the selected cycling potential window. Once the 
stable state is reached, the properties, including capacitance, of the electrode remains 
largely unchanged upon further cycling. It is also noticed that this final stable capacitance 
decreases most dramatically when the lower limit of the scanned potential range is 
lowered from -0.1 V to -0.2 V.
Fig. 7b presents the CVs of selected cycles for electrode S(-0.2, 0.8). One clearly 
sees a prominent reduction tail below 0.0 V for the initial cycles. However, there is no 
additional oxidation counter part occurs during the anodic scan. Thus, this reduction 
event is far less reversible than the redox couple occurring between 0.0 and 0.2 V as 
observed for S(0.0, 0.8) (Fig. 5b). Upon increasing cycling, while the capacitance 
decreases, the intensity of this low-potential reduction event also diminishes.  The

data, on the other hand, indicate that these surface inactive species are different from 
those formed in the S(0.0, 0.8) electrode, as different morphologies and Mn-ion valences 
were detected on these two electrodes. The exact crystallographic nature of the resulting 
surface species is not certain at this point. While the valence value (2.2; Table 1) is close 
to that of either MnO or Mn(OH)2, bulk MnO and Mn(OH)2 are known to be 
thermodynamically unstable under the present bulk electrolyte condition (pH= 6.0)  [19]. 
As the surface species are likely non-stoichiometric, its (or their) thermodynamic 
behaviors may not be determined from the phase diagrams of the bulk oxides.
From the viewpoint of practical operation, an increase in operating potential 
window can increase the stored energy density. However, the presence study indicates 
that the widening of potential window will suffer from dramatic capacitance reduction 
below certain potential. Based on the cycle stability presented here (Fig. 4a,5a and 7a), it 
may be suggested that the MnO2 electrode can be operated with potential as low as -0.1 V 
(versus Ag/AgCl). As OCP of the MnO2 electrode is ~0.4 V, lowering the potential limit 
from 0.0 V to -0.1 V is equivalent to increase the energy density of the negative electrode 
of a MnO2 symmetric EC by 56%, in spite of ~4% reduction in capacitance after long 
cycles (Fig. 7a). With further lowering in potential below -0.1V, the gain in energy 
density due to widened potential window is gradually offset by the loss in capacitance.
4. Conclusions:
The long-term electrochemical behaviors of hydrated MnO2 electrochemical 
capacitor (EC) electrode in KCl(aq) were studied by using potential cycling within 
different potential windows spanning from 0.8 V (versus Ag/AgCl(aq)) to varied lower-
end potentials below the open-circuit potential. The resulting microstructures and surface

電流傳輸至上層活性物質，有效提高安全性，是一個有創意的設計。此外，Prof Zelenay報告
利用 Co做為燃料電池的觸媒呈現出不低的活性，朝向非白金系列觸媒的開發跨出了一大步。
他們的研究成果發現，將還原的 Co做為觸媒，在反應條件下 Co晶粒自然氧化至最適的氧化

化鎢、碳化鈦，等等在高溫中將其中之第二元素利用 CVD的方式氣化後獲得。Prof. Simon
巧妙的利用不同正、負離子的搭配來探討孔徑與離子大小的關係，清楚的證實了離子在孔洞
中有序排列的趨勢，可說是這一類研究中之經典之作。

所造成的偽電容(pseudocapacitance)，在一定的電位範圍內，能有很大的電容，是屬於另一種
特殊的法拉第電容。其次，與會論文顯示愈來愈多從事固態或膠態電解液的論文，顯示超高
電容器元件的安全性，愈來愈受到重視，在這方面的研究，本實驗是提出的 PAAK膠態電解
質，大大提升氧化錳電容量的情形實屬難見，為一特殊的例子。
