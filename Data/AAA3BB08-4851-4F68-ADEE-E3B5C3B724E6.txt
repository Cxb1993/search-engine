From communication theory, we know that the reliability of trans-
mission can be increased through channel coding. We expect that the
performance of spatial watermarking can be improved using error correct-
ing codes. Nonetheless, the low signal-to-noise ratio encountered, due to
the perceptual constraints imposed to the watermark, makes necessary
the use of very powerful coding techniques as it happens in deep-space
communications.
Turbo code is well known to be the near-optimal error correcting codes.
In this project, we will use this code to improve the performance of the
spatial watermarking scheme. Also, for turbo decoding, the estimation
of the signal to noise ratio for the spatial domain watermark channel is
derived.

二、 緣由與目的
The enormous progress that digital technologies have experienced dur-
ing the last decades has contributed to the popularization of the use of
the electronic media for transmoission and storage of documents, images,
audio, video, and other types of information. The property of efficient
and without quality loss distribution increased the potential for intercep-
tion, manipulation, misuse, and unauthorized distribution of information.
So, the development of techniques for preserving the ownership of digital
information is the cornerstone of future multimedia services.
Watermarking techniques consist in adding an invisible and secret sig-
nal, called watermark, to an image. It can identify the issuer and the
intended recipient of the image. Based on spread spetrum concept, Cox
et al. (1) proposed a global DCT-based approach to hide watermarks.
In (2; 3; 4), the image is transformed into DCT domain by using block-
DCT. Swanson (5) used the perceptual mask to meet the requirement of
imperceptibility. Hernandez et al. (6) proposed the blind detection wa-
termarking. The original image is not needed in watermark detection. In
addition to embedding the watermark onto the transform domain, some
other algorithms (7; 8; 9) are proposed to embed the watermark directly
on spatial domain. Hernandez (10) analyzed the system performance of
this spatial domain watermarking scheme.
From general point of view, digital watermarking processes can be
taken as a communication system (11; 12; 13).
To improve the robustness of the watermark and increase the water-
marking channel capacity, applying the error correction codes to water-
marking scheme is a possible method. Hernandez et. al. (14; 15) apllied
the binary BCH codes and convolutional codes to spitial domain water-

Fig. 2 shows the watermark extraction process. We assume that the
original image x[m,n] is not available in the watermark extraction. There-
fore, it must be taken as an additive noise. To reduce the interference
caused by the original image, the watermarked image y[m,n] is, firstly,
filtered with a space-variant linear pre-filter hkl[m,n]. The low pass filter
and Wiener filter can be used as this pre-filter. The filter output
z[m,n] =
∑
k,l
hkl[m,n]y[m− k, n− l] (4)
Then, correlation detector reduces the whole image space (z[m,n]) to L-
dimentional vector space r = (r0, r1, · · · , rL−1) defined as:
ri , 〈z[m,n], pi[m,n]〉 =
∑
(m,n)
z[m,n]pi[m,n] (5)
After some algebraic operations, ri can be represented as:
ri = Aiibi +
L−1∑
j=0
j 6=i
Aijbj + ni (6)
= Aiibi + ni,ISI + ni (7)
= Aiibi + nTi (8)
where
Aij =
∑
kl
〈hkl[m,n]pj [m− k, n− l], pi[m,n]〉 (9)

Next, the σˆ2y [m,n] is estimated by the unbiased estimation as:
σˆ2y [m,n] =

k1=m−1

k2=n−1
(y[k1, k2]− mˆy[k1, k2])

can be evaluate from Eq. (21). Since variance is always not less than
0, σ2nTi
= 0 if the result of Eq. (21) less than 0.
Form Eq. (8), the amplitude of the antipodal signal is Aii. Another
representation of Eq. (9)
Aii =
∑

∑
(m,n)∈Si∩Skli

In summary, an efficient multi-pulse data hiding method is proposed.
Since the host signal should be seen as an additive noise in blind detection,
pre-filter and channel coding are needed for noise reduction and error
correction. In this project, we use the near optimum error correction
code (turbo code) to reduce the bit error rate of the proposed data hiding
system. Since soft values are needed for conventional turbo decoding, we
derived the approximate statistics of this watermark channel.
