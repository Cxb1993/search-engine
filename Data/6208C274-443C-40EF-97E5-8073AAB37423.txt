Abstract
We propose a theoretical framework for evaluation of magnetoelectroelastic poten-
tials in a fibrous composite with pizoelectric and piezomagnetic phases, motivated by
the technological desire for materials with large magnetoelectric coupling. We show
that the problem with transversely isotropic phases can be decomposed into two inde-
pendent problems, plane strain with transverse electromagnetic fields and anti-plane
shear with in-plane electromagnetic fields. We then consider the second problem in
detail, and generalize the classic work of Lord Rayleigh [1] to obtain the electrostatic
potential in an ordered conductive composite and its extension to a disordered system
by Kuo and Chen [2] to the current coupled magnetoelectroelastic problem. We use
this method to study BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 composites and provides insights into obtaining
large effective magnetoelectric coefficient.
1 Introduction
A variety of technological applications including magnetic field sensors, magnetically con-
trolled opto-electric devices and magneto-electric memories have motivated the study of
magneto-electric coupling in materials and composites [3, 4]. The magneto-electric coupling
was predicted by Landau and Lifshitz [5] and observed by Astrov [6] and by Rado and Folen
[7] over fifty years ago. The coupling is weak in monolithic materials, and this has moti-
vated the study of composites of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic media. The idea is that
the applied magnetic field causes a deformation of the piezomagnetic material which in turn
induces a deformation in the piezoelectric material thereby inducing an electric field.
The performance of a piezomagnetic/piezoeletric composite depends on the micro-geometry
of the phases since one has to provide effective strain coupling and avoid electromagnetic

coupling.
2 Arbitrary arrangement of circular cylinders
2.1 General setting
Let us consider an infinite medium R3 containing N arbitrarily distributed, parallel and
separated circular cylinders. The domain of the pth circular cylinder is denoted Vp, p =
1, 2, · · · , N,and the remaining matrix is denoted Ωm. We assume that the cylinders and
the matrix are made of distinct phases1. Further, we assume that each phase is either
piezoelectric or piezomagnetic. The constitutive laws for the rth phase is given by (see
Alshits et al. [26], for example)
σ(r) = C(r)ε(r) − eT (r)E(r) − qT (r)H(r),
D(r) = e(r)ε(r)+κ(r)E(r)+λ(r)H(r), (1)
B(r) = q(r)ε(r)+λ(r)E(r)+µ(r)H(r),
where σ, D, B, ε, E and H are the stress, electric displacement, magnetic flux, strain, electric
field, and the magnetic field respectively. C is the fourth-order tensor of elastic moduli, and
κ , µ and λ are the second order tensors of dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability
and magnetoelectric coefficients.
Now assume that each phase is transversely isotropic (i.e., has 6mm symmetry) with the
symmetry axes oriented with the cylinders. We introduce a Cartesian coordinate system
with the x− and y− axes in the plane of the cross-section and z− along the axes of the
cylinders. In the Voigt notation the properties C, e, q, κ, µ, and λ are given by Nye [27]:
1Later we shall specialize to a two-phase situation where all the cylinders belong to one phase and the
matrix to another.

2.2 Anti-plane shear with in-plane electromagnetic fields
We consider
ux = uy = 0, uz = w (x, y) ,
ϕ = ϕ (x, y) ,
ψ = ψ (x, y) , (6)
where ux, uy, uz are the mechanical displacements along the x−, y−, and z− axes, and ϕ
and ψ are the electric and magnetic potentials, respectively. The constitutive laws of the
constituents and of the composite for the non-vanishing fields can be recast in the form σzjDj
Bj
 =
 C44 e15 q15e15 −κ11 −λ11
q15 −λ11 −µ11
 εzj−Ej
−Hj
 (7)
where j denotes the component x, y. We can write this compactly as
ΣjΦ = LΦΨZ
j
Ψ, Φ,Ψ = w,ϕ, ψ, j = x, y, (8)
where
Σj =
 σzjDj
Bj
 , L =
 C44 e15 q15e15 −κ11 −λ11
q15 −λ11 −µ11
 , Zj =
 εzj−Ej
−Hj
 . (9)
The shear strains εzx and εzy, in-plane electric fields Ex and Ey, and in-plane magnetic fields
Hx and Hy can be derived from the gradient of elastic displacement, electric potential, and
magnetic potential as follows:
εzx =
∂w
∂x
, εzy =
∂w
∂y

Ex = −∂ϕ
∂x
, Ey = −∂ϕ
∂y
,
Hx = −∂ψ
∂x
, Hy = −∂ψ
∂y
. (10)
In the absence of body force, electric charge density and electric current density, the
equilibrium equations are given by

We now need to relate the solutions to the applied boundary conditions. We do so by
applying the Green’s second identity [28] to the matrix domain Ωm. This gives∫

unit normal to the matrix’s boundary ∂Ωm, dA

3 Periodic arrays
The analysis carried out in the previous section for the arbitrary system with a finite number
of cylinders may also be adapted for the case of a periodic array of cylinders. There are five
possible ways of packing cylinders in regular arrays in two dimensions (see [29], for instance).
Here we concentrate on the two lattices, rectangular and hexagonal. Further, we sketch the
outline of the derivation focussing on the differences from the previous situation. Finally, we
limit ourselves to the case of anti-plane shear with in-plane electromagnetic fields.
Let us first introduce a Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) positioned at the center O of
one of the cylinders in a square or a hexagonal array, as shown in Figure 2. The radius of the
cylinders is a and we may assume unit distance between the centers of neighboring cylinders
without loss of generality. Uniform intensities Ex and Hx are applied along the positive x
axis, and an anti-plane shear deformation εzx is applied out of the xy plane. In terms of
polar coordinates, the general solution has the admissible form

4 Effective moduli
We are interested in the effective behavior for a situation where we have a large number of
cylinders. The effective material properties are defined in terms averaged fields,〈
Σj
〉 ≡ L∗ 〈Zj〉 , (40)
where the angular brackets denote the average over the representative volume element (unit
cell in the case of periodic composites)

〈

〉
=

V
∫
V
Zj dx, (41)
and L∗ denotes the effective magnetoelectroelastic parameters of the composite.
We can compute the average Zj by noting that each component is a gradient and applying
the divergence theorem. We obtain
〈ZxΦ〉 = ZxΦ. (42)
Next, to find 〈ΣxΦ〉, we again use the divergence theorem and the equilibrium condition
(including the interface conditions) to obtain:
〈ΣxΦ〉 =

where ΣΦ is defined in (21). We then use the expansions (19) for the fields to obtain

Putting together (40) and (46) and noting that the coefficients BΦ1 depend linearly on the
applied field Z
x
Φ, we obtain set of equations for the effective property L
∗. We can determine
this by applying different loading combinations between εzx, Ex and Hx.

(non-zero) volume fraction even though this coefficient is zero for each component. However,
in this case it is monotone increasing with a sharp rise as the particles are close to touching.
Figure 5(d-f) show the potential contours for an applied magnetic field. Now, the magnetic
field is expelled by the fibers giving rise to a displacement which deforms the matrix to induce
an electric displacement. The amount of deformation it can cause in the matrix increases
with volume fraction, and this is reflected in the magnetoelectric coeffecient. Further, it
increases dramatically as the particles touch.
We finally turn to the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient, which is the important figure
of merit for magnetic field sensors. It relates the overall electric field that is generated in the
composite when it is subjected to a magnetic field. It combines the coupling and dielectric
coefficients, and is defined by
α∗E11 = λ
∗
11/κ
∗
11. (47)
Figure 6 shows how this coefficient depends on the volume fraction for the various cases.
Note that there is a qualitative difference between the case of BTO fibers in CFO and its
complement. In the former, the maximum coefficient is for an intermediate volume fraction
of f = 0.35 where α∗E11 = 0.0306 V/cmOe independent of the square or hexagonal geometry.
In contrast, in the case of CFO fibers in the BTO matrix, the maximum is attained as the
fibers begin to touch. These trends are similar to those of the magnetoelectric coefficient
described before, and follow from the same reasons.
6 Plane strain with transverse electromagnetic fields
We briefly discuss the other problem described in (4), and the potential for using it for large
effective magnetoelectric coefficient. Consider a situation where the average normal stress
as well as the average electric displacement along the fibers are zero
〈σzz〉 = 0, 〈Dz〉 = 0. (48)
The constitutive equations (2) specialized to the current setting (see (A.1) and (A.2)) then
implies that
〈C33〉 εzz = −〈C13 (εxx + εyy)〉+ 〈e33〉Ez + 〈q33〉Hz, (49)
〈e33〉 εzz = −〈e31 (εxx + εyy)〉 − 〈κ33〉Ez − 〈λ33〉Hz. (50)
Eliminating εzz between the two equations above, we obtain
〈e33〉
〈C33〉 (−〈C13 (εxx + εyy)〉+ 〈e33〉Ez + 〈q33〉Hz) = −〈e31 (εxx + εyy)〉 − 〈κ33〉Ez − 〈λ33〉Hz,
(51)
or (
〈e33〉2
〈C33〉 + 〈κ33〉
)
Ez =
〈e33〉 〈C13 (εxx + εyy)〉
〈C33〉 − 〈e31 (εxx + εyy)〉
−
(〈e33〉 〈q33〉
〈C33〉 + 〈λ33〉
)
Hz. (52)
15
(a) (b)
Figure 6: Effective magnetoelectric voltage coefficient of the composite versus the fiber
volume fraction. (a) BTO fibers in a CFO matrix. (b) CFO fibers in a BTO matrix.
We now assume further that the average planar strain is zero (alternately, we can proceed
exactly the same if the effective planar stress is zero). Then, strain depends linearly on Ez
and Hz, and thus, we can write
〈e33〉 〈C13 (εxx + εyy)〉
〈C33〉 − 〈e31 (εxx + εyy)〉 = AEz +BHz. (53)
A and B depend on the solution of the plane strain homogenization problem. Substituting
(53) into (52), we obtain(
〈e33〉2
〈C33〉 − A+ 〈κ33〉
)
Ez =
(
B − 〈e33〉 〈q33〉〈C33〉 − 〈λ33〉
)
Hz. (54)
The magnetoelectric voltage coefficient is the ratio of the two terms in parenthesis,
α∗E33 =
B − 〈e33〉〈q33〉〈C33〉 − 〈λ33〉
〈e33〉2
〈C33〉 − A+ 〈κ33〉
. (55)
In particular, we concentrate on the denominator. Notice that only A depends on the
microgeometry and the planar moduli where as the rest of the terms do not. Thus, it
is possible to tune the microgeometry to reduce the denominator to get extremely large
coupling.
We may use the methodology described in this paper to compute A and B. However,
in contrast to anti-plane shear, plane strain elasticity is a vectorial problem and thus the
method is significantly more difficult to implement. This is the topic of current work and
will be presented elsewhere.
17
We have
εzz = 0, εzy = uz,y, εzx = uz,x. (A.5)
With the above and the equilibrium equations (3), the problem splits naturally into the two
