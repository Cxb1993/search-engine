Project Title?Developing a High Efficient Safety Evaluation System for Building 
Deformation(1/3) 
 
Abstract 
 
Keyword: 3D Laser Scanner, Image Processing, Building, Safety Monitoring 
 
    Buildings in our nation are frequently suffering from distortion and cracks 
usually caused by adjacent construction or overloading or improper alteration of 
partitions. It is unfortunate that the traditional building monitoring system can 
provide only the data of one location with one direction but not the entire building 
information. In this research, the data acquired from 3D laser scanner integrated with 
the image taken by DV photography are adopted to constitute a real-time and highly 
precise building safety monitoring system. This high performance building safety 
evaluation system can not only provide the monitoring data but also send alarms 
whenever the deformation of the building monitored is over or close to the allowable 
limits in the building codes. 
    The purpose of this research is to establish a quick and precise system for 
building safety evaluation in order to provide the information for the public about 
the safety status of their residence. 
This research is scheduled to be completed in three years. In the first year 
project, a data processing program of 3D scanning data of the practical building is 
completed, and an building safety evaluation system is developed through some 
structural tests in which the data obtained by 3D scanner and the image taken by DV 
photography can be integrated for practical application.
