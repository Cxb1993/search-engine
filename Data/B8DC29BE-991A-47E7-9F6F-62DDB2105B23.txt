the estimated angle are then used to determine the 
probable position of the target. The position of the 
target can be found by intersecting lines drawn from 
estimated angles to different spinning beacons in the 
localization phase. The subsections below describe the 
Doppler Effect, the proposed technique for deriving 
angular information and, finally, the localization 
algorithm based on angular information. 
 
Doppler Effect 
The Doppler Effect refers to the perceived variation in 
frequency and wavelength given the velocity of a 
moving object relative to a wave source. Since the 
speed of a radio wave c is much greater than the 
relative velocity between the wave source and the 
observer, the frequency shift  f, also known as the 
Doppler shift, can be expressed as 
v
f  f
c
 !  (1) 
where f denotes the transmitted frequency, and v is the 
velocity of the wave source relative to the observer. 
The relative velocity v is negative when the wave 
source is moving away from the observer. As Figure 1 
shows, if the wave source is not moving directly 
toward/away from the observer, the relative velocity v 
in Equation (1) should be replaced by the projected 
velocity on the line connecting the observer and wave 
source.  
 
 
Figure 1. Illustration of Doppler Effect. 
 
Doppler-Angulation  
Doppler-angulation is the proposed method for 
determining the angle between a stationary target and a 
reference node to a spinning beacon. This angle is 
referred to as the orientation angle. Figure 2 illustrates 
the concept of the Doppler-angulation method where X 
is the stationary target at distance d from origin O, and 
the direction from origin O to X is angle !. The position 
vector of node X is: 
OX  = (d cos , d sin )" "# #
   !
 (2) 
 
 
Figure 2. Illustration of Doppler-angulation. 
 
The S is the spinning beacon node or a wave source 
rotating counterclockwise around the origin O at a 
constant angular velocity " with a rotational radius r. 
To maintain generality, the polar angle of S is denoted 
as #(t)="t+$. Note that the polar angle of S is the angle 
included by OS 
   !
and the positive x-axis. At time t, the 
position vector of S is: 
OS  = (r cos( t+ ), r sin( t+ ))$ % $ %# #

The tangent line velocity vector v(t) of the beacon node 
S is  
(t) = (- r sin( t+ ), r cos( t+ ))$ $ % $ $ %# #v
          (4)
   
According to Equation (1), the observed Doppler shift 
is proportional to the projected velocity on the line 
between the spinning beacon and the target. In Figure 2, 
the vector of the target-beacon connection is SX
   !

the velocity projected on SX

v(t) and the unit vector of SX

According to Equation (1), the Doppler shift of the 
projected velocity is:

system: (a) deployment layout, (b) angulation phase 
and (c) localization phase. 
 
Doppler Shifted Signal Generation 
The first step is to generate Doppler shifted signals. A 
beacon embedded with a RF transceiver module 
transmits radio signals while spinning. However, a 
typical RF carrier frequency in the 400 MHz ~ 2.4 GHz 
range is too high for analysis by a hardware-constrained 
sensor node due to its slow clock and limited sampling 
rate. The radio interferometry method developed by 
Maroti et al. [2] is therefore used to overcome such 
limitations. Radio interferometry measures RF Doppler 
shift with sufficient accuracy using inexpensive sensor 
hardware such as MICA2 motes and is used in the 
system as follows. First, two sensor nodes 
simultaneously transmit sine waves at two very similar 
high  
 
Figure 6. An example deployment of SpinLoc system. 
An assistive beacon is added after initial 
deployment. 
 
radio frequencies f1 and f2. The similarity of the two RF 
signals produces an interference RF signal with a low 
frequency envelope |f1-f2|. For example, two high 
frequency 900 MHz radios can transmit sine waves at 
slightly different frequencies to produce a low 
interference frequency envelope below 1 kHz, which is 
slow enough for analysis by a MICA2 mote.  
 
Radio interferometry requires simultaneous 
transmissions from two radios. Therefore, as Figure 6 
shows, a static assistive beacon is required. The 
spinning beacon transmits RF signals at its original 
frequency (f1) and any receiver P will perceive radio 
frequency at f1 plus a Doppler shift ( f1
P). The assistive 
beacon simultaneously emits signals at a fixed 
frequency (f2). Since the assistive beacon is stationary, 
the interference frequency, i.e., |f1-f2+ f1
P
|, is affected 
only by the Doppler shift in the signal frequency of the 
spinning beacon. Fine-tuning the Doppler shifted 
interference frequency |f1-f2+ f1
P
| to a low frequency 
range under 1 kHz enables detection and analysis of the 
signal by a MICA2 mote. 
 
Frequency Record 
The second step is for X and R to record their received 
Doppler shifted frequencies from S1. X and R receive 
radio frequencies and analyze them by RSS 
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on sensor nodes. The 
real-time time-domain frequency estimation method 
proposed by Maroti et al. [2] is used to detect the RSS 
peak timestamps and estimate the interference frequency. 
For example, if the RSS sampling rate is 17,800 Hz and 
the number of samples between adjacent RSS peaks is 30, 
the interference frequency is approximately 17,800/30 = 
593.3 Hz. Receiver nodes X and R send their RSS peak 
timestamps to the base station where the timestamps are 
then analyzed to reconstruct their frequency waveforms. 
 
Orientation Angle Calculation 
The third step is to calculate the orientation angle using 
the frequency waveforms of X and R. Specifically, as 
Figure 5(b) shows, this orientation angle is the angle 
between nodes R and X relative to spinning beacon S. A 
simple method of calculating this orientation angle is to 
use the Doppler-angulation method described in 
 7 
orientation lines to intersect at three different points 
rather than at the same point.  
 
Given multiple intersection points, a target can be 
located by several different algorithms. For example, 
the Centroid algorithm locates the target at the Centroid 
of these three intersection points. SpinLoc proposed 
here uses the Weighted Centroid algorithm, which 
weights each intersection point according to an 
internally computed confidence value. This confidence 
value is proportional to the acuteness of the intersection 
angle between two intersecting orientation lines 
because the acuteness angle affects the sensitivity of 
angular error on positional error. For example, as 
Figure 8 shows, when the intersection angle is close to 
0 or 180 degrees, even a minor angular error can 
produce a large positional error. Note that the x-axis 
and y-axis error sensitivities for each intersection point 
differ and are considered separately. 
 
 
Figure 8. Example of a minor angular error causing 
a large positional error. 
 
PARAMETRIC TUNING AND PERFORMANCE 
TRADEOFF 
Different value settings of tunable parameters 
determine overall system performance. The main 
system performance metrics considered are positional 
accuracy and positioning latency. Positional accuracy 
measures the difference between an estimated location 
and a ground-truth location. Positioning latency is the 
time required for SpinLoc to measure and estimate a 
position. The tunable system parameters are (1) 
Doppler-angulation filtering threshold, (2) data 
collection time, (3) rotational velocity, (4) interference 
frequency and (5) rotational radius. Generally, tuning 
these parameters improves accuracy but at the expense 
of prolonged latency, and vice versa. Restated, 
adjusting these parameters determines the performance 
tradeoff between accuracy and latency. 
 
(1) Doppler-angulation filtering threshold: The 
delay-and-compare process described in subsection 
3.3 has the following two outputs: estimated time 
delay k and minimum distance DXY[k] between two 
input signals. The minimum distance reveals the 
quality of the estimation. A smaller minimum 
distance indicates a more reliable time delay 
estimation. Therefore, before using the measured 
angular information to localize the target, poor 
angular estimation is filtered out as noise according 
to the minimum distance. Since the stricter filtering 
threshold removes more noise from the dataset, it 
produces a more accurate angulation result. 
Although a stricter filtering threshold increases 
overall positioning latency, it also prolongs the 
positioning latency to acquire enough high-quality 
orientation angle estimates. 
(2) Data collection time: A longer data collection time 
increases the number of signal samples, which 
enables more precise reconstruction of frequency 
waveforms and improves positional accuracy. 
However, the tradeoff is increased positioning 
latency. Notably, an overly long data collection 
time has adverse effects such as increased carrier 
frequency drift and clock drift. 
(3) Rotational velocity: An instantaneous radio 
frequency is difficult to detect when rotational 
velocity is high because of the shorter time that a 
rapidly spinning beacon is positioned in a specific 
direction. Faster rotation reduces the number of 
signal samples collected and thus reduce the 
precision of frequency waveform detection, which 
increases positional error. However, high rotational 
velocity improves positioning latency because it 
provides more signal samples for 
Doppler-angulation. Note that a very slow 
rotational velocity may also produce a large 
positional error because frequency waveforms of 
small Doppler shifts are more difficult to 
distinguish.   
(4) Interference frequency: Because of the Doppler 
Effect and the characteristics of radio 
interferometry, a higher interference frequency 
increases the Doppler shift, which also improves 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the frequency 
waveform. However, a high interference frequency 
also has certain disadvantages. For example, if the 
interference frequency is 500 Hz and the signal 
sampling rate is 17,800 Hz, the number of signals 
sampled per period is 17,800/500 = 35.6. When the 
interference frequency increases to 1,000 Hz, the 
number of signals sampled per period is halved to 
17,800/1,000 = 17.8. Fewer signal samples degrade 
the precision of the frequency detection in radio 
interferometry, thus affecting the positional 
accuracy of the SpinLoc system.  
(5) Rotational radius: A long rotational radius (r) and 
a high angular velocity (") of a spinning beacon 
produce large Doppler shifts because, as Figure 2 
shows, the tangent line velocity (v(t)) is the product 
of r and ". Further, large Doppler shifts produce 
more distinguishable frequency waveforms, which 
improve the SNR of the frequency waveform and 
reduce positional error. However, a long rotational 
radius also has disadvantages. A long rotational 
radius (r) not only requires a larger physical space, 
it also, as Equation (8) shows, increases the 
approximation error in Equation (8) as the r/d ratio 
increases. Fortunately, the effect of the 
approximation error is mitigated by the proposed 
method of estimating the orientation angle. The 
proposed method of identifying phase shift in two 
Doppler shifted frequency signals is not sensitive 
to r/d ratios. Varying the r/d pairs numerically 
simulates two non-approximated waveforms from 
Equation (7) when performing the orientation 
 9 
mitigated in the localization phase because these large 
errors could be identified as outliers by analyzing the 
intersection of multiple orientation lines measured by 
multiple spin beacons. 
 
Figure 14 shows the probability distribution function 
(PDF) of angular errors from the same dataset in Figure 
12 without taking absolute values. The figure shows 
that angular errors were equally distributed between 
positive and negative.

Doppler-Angulation Filtering 
Figure 15 shows the relationship between angular errors 
and filtering thresholds from 5 (stricter) to 15 (less 
strict, as  
 
Figure 15. Angular errors and filtered out data 
ratios under different filtering thresholds from none 
to 5. 
 
 
Figure 16. CDF of the angular errors under 
different filtering thresholds. 
 
well as the relationship between data reduction % and 
filtering thresholds. Clearly, without the noise filtering, 
angular errors were relatively large (see “No Filter” in 
the x-axis of Figure 15). However, at the strictest noise 
filtering threshold, the system removed almost 80% of 
the received packets. Our system was deployed with a 
filtering threshold value set at 10, which was sufficient 
to reduce most of noisy data. Figure 16 shows the 
corresponding CDF of angular errors under different 
filtering thresholds.  
 
Data Collection Times  
Figure 17 shows the positional errors at different length 
of data collection times (0.3 ~ 1.5 seconds). Two curves 
plot the median positional errors and 90% positional 
errors. The analytical results show that a longer data 
collection time generally reduces positional error 
because the increased number of signal samples enables 
more accurate reconstruction of frequency waveforms. 
At the shortest data collection time of 0.3 seconds, the 
SpinLoc system still achieved sub-meter accuracy with 
90% positional error of 93 centimeters. Figure 18 
depicts the corresponding CDF  
 11 
of each data collection cycle. 
(2) Carrier frequency drift: This error may be caused 
by the MICA2 motes hardware, as described in [2]. 
Although reducing the data collection time can 
minimize frequency drift, the number of signal 
samples collected may be insufficient for precise 
reconstruction of frequency change waves. 
However, since the system analyzes Doppler 
waveforms rather than actual frequencies, carrier 
frequency drift has only minor effects on system 
performance. 
(3) Indoor multipath interference: An advantage of 
working in the frequency domain is that reflection 
wave remains the same frequency as the incident 
wave. However, this advantage applies only to a 
static wave source. When the wave source is 
moving, Doppler Effect causes the Line-of-Sight 
signal and the multipath signals to be at slightly 
different frequencies. Therefore, the estimated 
frequency is still affected by the indoor multipath 
interference.  
RELATED WORK 
The most relevant work is the 
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) technique. The 
FDOA is analogous to time-difference-of-arrival 
(TDOA) for estimating the location of a radio emitters 
based on observations from several known points. Such 
a technique was employed by Kusy et al. [6] to track 
mobile targets by using infrastructure nodes as 
receivers and targets as beacon emitters. When the 
target is moving in such a system, each infrastructure 
receiver observes varying Doppler shifts depending on 
their positions relative to the moving target. The target 
location and velocity are then solved by constrained 
non-linear squares (CNLS) optimization given the input 
parameters of geometric relationships between nodes, 
different Doppler shift measurements and the target 
velocity vector. However, due to signal noise, Kusy 
reported accurate results in velocity estimation but no 
positioning estimation. They therefore combined the 
accurate estimated velocity vector with the Extended 
Kalman Filter (EKF) in a tracking task, which achieved 
an average localization error of 1.5 to 3 meters in an 
outdoor environment.  
 
The underlying technique used by Kusy et al. [6] to 
measure Doppler shifts with low-cost hardware is the 
radio Interferometry approach used in RIPS [2]. The 
RIPS approach uses two nodes transmitting RF signals 
at slightly different frequencies to produce an 
interference frequency envelop at a low frequency, 
which can then be measured and analyzed by a low 
sampling rate ADC on a MICA2 mote. The RIPS 
measures the relative phase offset of the received 
interference signals to obtain q-range information, 
which is the linear combination of distances between 
the two radio transmitters and the two receivers.  
Many other proposed sensor network positioning 
systems can be broadly classified as ranging-based and 
ranging-free methods. 
 
(1) Ranging-based methods. These methods commonly 
require signal communications between an anchor 
observer and a locating target. The major differences 
among them are the varying calibration methods and 
the use of different signal sources, such as sonic, 
ultrasonic, infrared, camera, RF, etc. For example, 
Acoustic ENSBox [19] employs a distribution acoustic 
sensing platform which enables rapid deployment and 
self-calibration of an acoustic embedded networked 
sensing box. The system can reportedly achieve 
positional accuracy to within 5 centimeters in a partially 
obstructed 80 × 50 m
2
 outdoor environment. Given that 
signals propagate at constant velocity, time–of-arrival 
(TOA) methods [23][24] estimate distance by 
measuring signal propagation time. Angle-of-arrival 
(AOA) [25] is a network-based solution that exploits 
the geometric properties of the arriving signal. By 
measuring the angle at which the signal arrives at 
multiple receivers, the system can accurately estimate 
location. The TDOA [26] is another network-based 
system which infers distance by measuring time 
differences. Some hybrid approaches of TOA, AOA 
and TDOA have also been proposed [27].  
Another class of techniques measures the RSS. These 
techniques exploit the decaying model of 
electromagnetic fields to translate RSS into a 
corresponding distance [28] [29] [30].The frequency 
bands used for transmission may also vary. For 
example, the well-known RADAR system [18] uses RF, 
and LADAR and SONAR use visible light and audible 
sound bands, respectively. Other systems such as 
LADAR and SONAR analyze signals reflected from an 
object to estimate its location. A recent innovation, 
Cricket [7], employs a hybrid approach using both RF 
and ultrasonic bands. However, the propagation 
characteristics are irregular in actual outdoor 
environments [8]. Localization systems using RSS 
information have similar limitations and usually 
achieve only meter-level accuracy.  
 
(2) Range-free methods. These methods use other 
alternatives to range estimation between anchor nodes 
to localize targets. For example, APIT [22] estimates 
the location of targets based on the connectivity 
information to anchor node with known location. The 
greater the number of deployed anchor nodes, the 
greater the accuracy of the technique. Restated, 
accuracy highly depends on the density of deployed 
anchor nodes. One class of techniques detects 
sequences of artificially generated events from an event 
scheduler. For example, Spotlight [21] and Lighthouse 
[20] correlate the event detection time of a sensor node 
with known spatiotemporal relationships. The detection 
events are then mapped to estimate position. However, 
generating and disseminating these events in a 
large-scale area is relatively difficult, particularly given 
the calibration requirements.
