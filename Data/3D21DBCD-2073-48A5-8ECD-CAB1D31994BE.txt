iteration procedure consumes the
majority of time. In this project, we
adopted the one called the
cross-diamond-hexagonal search (CDHS)
to replace the full search and the sum of
absolute difference (SAD) matching
criteria is employed in the motion
estimation process. Moreover, in the ME
problems, we are bound to face some
critical issues that are very likely to
damage the accuracy of the estimation.
One of the most common problems is
occlusion, which means the covering or
uncovering region incurred by the
motion of some object in the frame. This
project proposed to incorporate a
qualification strategy into the estimating
process to help eliminate the unqualified
motion vectors and therefore strengthen
the reliability of these suboptimal
solutions.
The proposed method was
implemented and tested on video
sequences with different degrees of
Gaussian noises on the LR sequences.
We adopt the peak signal to noise ratio
(PSNR) to make quantitative
comparisons between our proposed
method and other SR reconstruction
methods so that we are able to judge
whether the performance of our SR
algorithm is better or not. The proposed
method gives 4.12dB, 1.86dB, and
1.04dB improvements over the
nearest-neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic
interpolation, respectively in terms of
PSNR. When compared to the original
Bayesian MAP SR method, the proposed
method performs slightly better but
saves 50% of the processing time of the
former.
一.緣由與目的
Super resolution (SR) is a signal
processing algorithm that endeavors to
increase spatial or temple resolution of
images from a set of low resolution (LR)
observations. The more available low
resolution observations provided, the
more accurate SR reconstruction could
be achieved. Restoration [1, 5, 8, 24]
and interpolation [37, 10, 11, 23] are two
related problems to super resolution.
The former is just to recover the
degraded images without changing sizes
and the latter has a difficulty of
recovering high frequency of images.
Thus they really can not be considered
as super resolution techniques.
The two biggest problems in the SR
reconstruction are the SR algorithm and
registration. The trailblazers of
multi-frame SR algorithms are Tsai and
Huang, who were inspired by the study
of resolution enhancement of the
pictures taken from satellites [35]. The
authors proposed this pioneering
algorithm which utilizes relationships
between the global motion translational
model and the aliasing property of
frequency domain to restore a
band-limited still image from these
observed under-sampled data. Later,
Kim, Bose and Valenzuela [13] extended
this seminal frequency domain approach,
they considered more generalized model
frames to be reconstructed can be
depicted in the following notation [3].
, ,( )l l k k l kf C d f n  ,l k W (1)
where ,( )l kC d indicates the motion
compensation procedure in matrix form
mapping frame kf to frame lf , and
the matrix is of size
( ) ( )qM qN qM qN   ; vector ,l kd
stands for the motion vector describing
the motion information between frame
kf and frame lf in the HR field, and
,l kn is the registration noise with the
size of ( ) 1qM qN  . The
representation connecting HR and LR
frames is denoted as
l lg Hf l W (2)
where H is a ( ) ( )M N qM qN  
sub-sampling matrix contains p2 values
of 21 p in each row, corresponding to
the number of pixels in each
neighborhood [27]. By combing (1) and
(2), there is a much more inclusive
relationship between LR and HR frames,
and it is given as
, ,( )l l k k l kg HC d f e  (3)
where ,l ke is the acquisition noise and
usually assumed to be additive i.i.d
Gaussian noise. Like (1) the motion
between LR frames can be expressed by
,( ) ,l l k kg C v g l k W  (4)
where ,l kv is the motion vector
recording the motion between LR
frames lg and kg . Then according to
(3) that describes the acquisition process,
the following conditional probability
distribution comes out

where 2 is the variance of the
additive i.i.d Gaussian noise, kf is the
frame under estimation currently, and l
is the temporal index for the frame
which is adjacent to kf . By applying
Bayes’ theorem, we then have

where kf and d are the estimated

have
   ( 1) ( )ˆarg max log | ,kP P f   dd d g d

where ( 1)d is the ( 1) th estimate of
the displacement and ( )kˆf
 is the th
estimate of the HR frame. After that, the
pixel intensity is estimated with the
assumption that the previously estimated
displacement ( 1)d is correct, so we
have
 ( 1)
kf

for many applications [36]. Many fast
BMAs had been presented [16]–[21]. In
this project, we adopted the one called
the cross-diamond-hexagonal search
(CDHS) [6] to replace the full search
and the sum of absolute difference (SAD)
matching criteria is employed in the
motion estimation process.
In almost all of the ME problems,
we are bound to face some critical issues
that are very likely to damage the
accuracy of the estimation. One of the
most common problems is occlusion
[38], which means the covering or
uncovering region incurred by the
motion of some object in the frame. In
our proposed method for estimating the
motion vectors, a basic mechanism was
incorporated to help eliminate the
unqualified motion vectors and then
strengthen the reliability of these
suboptimal solutions. We proposed a
block-wise method that uses the block as
the processing unit, that is, if the
outcome of the processed block is not
satisfatory, we have the right to discard
the motion estimation result
corresponding to it. By this way, it helps
us get rid of those occlusion problems
and poor motion estimation. Moreover,
the selection for the eligible motion
vectors helps to compensate for the
possible inaccuracy of the fast BMA.
Put all the considerations above
together, the proposed algorithm is
summarized as follows.
1. The first step ( 0 ) is to construct
an initial guess (0)kˆf for the image,
which is usually implemented by
means of traditional interpolation
method.
2. Estimating the motion vectors
( 1)
,ˆl kd
 and Eq. (9) is used as the
matching criterion in the CDHS
method.
3. Compute the smoothing parameter
 for this iteration.
4. Calculate the gradient  with
( )
kˆf
 and ( 1),ˆl kd
 , and the wavelet
modulus is used.
5. Determine which motion vector is
unqualified and the associated
block is eliminated in the next step.
6. Update ( 1)kˆf
 by calculating Eq.
(14).
7. If the difference between the two
most recently estimated image,
( 1) ( )ˆ ˆ
k kf f
     , is less than a
predetermined value , or the
iteration reaches a maximal
iteration number max , terminate
the iteration and get ( 1)ˆ ˆMAPk kf f
 .
Otherwise, go back to step 2 and
increment .

Table 1 The comparison of PSNR and computation time for the sequence news with
the additive Gaussian noise with  0, 2N in (a) and with  0,10N in (b)
respectively.
As can be seen from the table, both
the original MAP Bayesian SR method
and the proposed SR method obviously
outperform the three other traditional
image interpolation methods when we
consider the image PSNR. But if we
care about the processing time these
methods consume, it is obvious that the
image interpolation methods are much
more efficient because they are of
simpler mechanism. Nevertheless, we
find that the proposed method saves lots
of the processing time wasted by the
original Bayesian MAP method, even
though it does not sharply increases the
performance on PSNR. This
experimental result also endorses the
legitimacy of the CDHS and valid
motion vector selection method by
confirming that the selection can
compensate for the possible failure of
the CDHS.
When the variance of the additive
Gaussian noise is raised, the
performance of these methods
decrease since the noise affects the
fidelity of interpolated and
super-resolved sequences. But the
proposed method still give better
performance as compared to the other
methods
