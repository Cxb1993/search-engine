2. Introduction
In order to achieve miniaturization of the
dimensions of the devices and for the system
work with high efficiency and stability, many
researches have been focusing on developing
dielectric materials with high quality factor
(Qf), high dielectric constant (r) and zero
temperature coefficient of resonant frequency
(f) for the use of dielectric resonator and
microwave device substrate. High dielectric
constant material can effectively reduce the
size of resonators. The inverse of the
dielectric loss is required to be high for
achieving prominent frequency selectivity and
stability in microwave transmitter components
and small temperature coefficient of the
resonant frequency is to ensure the stability of
the microwave components at different
working temperature. Several complex
perovskites ceramics A(B1/2B1/2)O3 (A = Me2+,
Me3+；B= Me2+, Me3+；B= Me4+, Me5+, Me6+)
have been reported due to their excellent
microwave dielectric properties [1-6]. Among
these materials, Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 (Ln = La, Sm,
Nd, Dy, Y) ceramics, has been widely used as
substrate for superconducting microwave
devices since it provides a high quality factor,
excellent lattice matching and a good matching
for thermal expansion [5-7].
Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions which were
measured quality factor (Q×f) of the ceramic
specimens was larger than 30000 (GHz) and
dielectric constant revealed between 22 and 27
have noncubic symmetry and the GdFeO3-type
structure [5]. Since La(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 has a
dielectric constant ( r) of 29, a quality factor
(Q×f) of 75500 (GHz) and a temperature
coeficients of resonant frequency (τf) of –65, it
is one of Ln(Mg1/2Ti1/2)O3 compositions was
determined to be suitable substrates for
YBa2Cu3OX thin film and resonator used in
microwave applications. In addition, because
of the ion radius of Zn+2 is similar to that of
Mg+2, the ion of Mg+2 can be substituted by the
ion of Co+2 to form Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3
compositions. It also possesses suitable
microwave dielectric properties ( r~ 31.6, Qf
~ 170000 GHz, f ~ –42 ppm/C at sintering
temperature of 1330oC) for applications in
dielectric resonators [8]. However, the
sintering temperatures of conventional
microwave dielectric ceramics used for
dielectric resonators, filters and other
communication devices normally at
1200-1400oC. For practical applications, it is
necessary to reduce the sintering temperature of
Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics. Low melting glass
addition, chemical processing and small particle
sizes of the starting materials are generally
advantageous to reduce the sintering
temperature of dielectric materials [9-12]. In
the past, liquid phase flux such as V2O5 were
added to lower the sintering temperature of
ceramics [13]. In this report, V2O5 was added
to further lower the sintering temperature. The
crystalline phases, the microstructures and the
microwave dielectric properties of V2O5-doped
Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics were investigated.
3. Experimental Procedure
Sample of Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 was prepared
using conventional solid-state method from
individual high-purity oxide powders(>99.9%):
4wt% V2O5-1300
oC 6wt% V2O5-1300

with various V2O5 additions at different sintering
temperatures
The plots of density and dielectric constant
of the V2O5-doped Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics at
different sintering temperature are demonstrated
in Fig. 3 It indicated that densities of 6.18-
6.51 (g/cm2) were obtained for V2O5-doped
Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics at sintering
temperatures from 1240 to 1300°C. The
density increased with increasing sintering
temperature due to enlarged grain size as
observed in Fig. 2. The maximum density was
found to be 6.51 g/cm3 for specimen with 6
wt% V2O5 addition at 1300°C. The
relationship between dielectric constant and
sintering temperature reveals the same trend as
that for relative density and sintering
temperature since higher density means lower
porosity. The increase of dielectric constant
values could be demonstrated owing to higher
densities. The dielectric constant slightly
increased with increasing amount of V2O5
addition. The increase in r could be
explained owing to higher densities. The
variation of r was mainly a result of the
density of the specimen. With 6 wt% addition, a
r value of 29.9 was obtained for
Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics sintered at 1300C.

Fig. 4 shows the Qf and the temperature
coefficients of resonant frequency (f) of the
V2O5-doped Nd(Zn1/2Ti1/2)O3 ceramics at
different sintering temperatures. The microwave
dielectric loss is mainly caused not only by the
lattice vibrational modes, but also by the pores
and the second phases [16]. With 6 wt V2O5
addition, Qf increased from 84000 to 105000
GHz as the sintering temperature increased from
1240 to 1300C for 4 h. The increase in Qf was
due to the grain growth as observed in Fig. 2.
However, the relationships between Qf values
and sintering temperatures reveal the same trend
as those between densities and sintering
temperatures. Relative density also plays an
important role in controlling the dielectric loss

Microstrip Cross-Coupled Interdigital Hairpin Bandpass Filter

Introduction
In wireless communication systems, small size and high performance filters are needed to
reduce the cost and improve the system performance. They can be designed in many different
ways. However, further miniaturization becomes more difficult for this filter. Planar filters
provide good miniaturization ability [1]-[4]. Therefore, there has been much research conducted
on planar filters and their components.
Since microstrip resonators are the basic components of a planar filter design, it is necessary to
select proper resonator types used in a filter design. A conventional haft-wavelength open-line
microstrip resonator is too large to be used in the modern communication system such as 900MHz,
1800MHz for personal communication systems (PCS). The hairpin filters [1], [5]-[7] were folded
from the open line 2 wavelength microstrip resonator to become U-shaped resonators make
progress in circuit size reduction from the parallel-coupled line structure. Since 1989, the
miniaturized hairpin resonator was developed by several researchers [7]-[9]. The interdigital
coupled lines at the ends of this structure are used as a capacitor in order to reduce the resonator
size. In addition, cross-coupled filter with these attractive characteristics is that of quasi-elliptic
function response filters with a pair of attenuation poles at finite frequencies [10], [11]. The
capability of placing attenuation poles near the cutoff frequencies of the pass-band improves the
selectivity using less resonators. A cross-coupled between a pair of nonadjacent resonators was
approached this type filter. The filter employing the cross coupled generally results in a compact
topology.
In this paper, a design of a microstrip four-pole cross-coupled elliptic function filter using
compact interdigital hairpin resonators was presented. The design approach enables one to use
EM simulator to complete the filter design, to determine the physical dimensions of the filters.
Design of A Four-Pole Cross-Coupled Bandpass Filter
Fig.1 shows the layout and equivalent electrical parameters of an interdigital hairpin resonator.
Its fundamental condition is hence the same as that of a conventional miniaturized hairpin resonator
[12]. In the case of ieios ZZZ  , the total electrical length of these resonators become shorter than
13
desirable values. It was found that the sharper skirt properties of the cross-coupled filter. The
measurements are performed with an HP8757D network analyzer. The measured performance is
shown in Fig. 4. With using FR4 substrate, the mid-band insertion loss is about 1.26 dB and the
return loss is about 21 dB at the center frequency of 1.8 GHz, and 3 dB passband width is about 4.5
%. A comparison between the measurement and simulation is presented that the measured response
strongly influenced by fabricated processing.
Conclusion
Miniaturized interdigital hairpin resonator is proposed. A four-pole cross-coupled bandpass
filter is also implemented. The validity of the proposed method was confirmed through the design,
fabrication and measurement of compact hairpin bandpass filter at 1.8 GHz on FR4 substrate. The
insertion loss of the filter with using FR4 substrate is about 1.26 dB, however, the attenuation
values out of the band was below 16.7 dB on the lower frequency region, and approximately 20.6
dB in the higher frequency region. The compactness in the circuit size make the design of
cross-coupled filters using the microstrip miniaturized hairpin resonators attractive for further
developments and applications in modern communication systems.
