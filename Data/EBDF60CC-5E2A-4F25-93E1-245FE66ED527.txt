Abstract 
The present study reports an assay approach that can detect single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP) and identify the position of the point mutation through a single-strand specific 
nuclease reaction and a gold nanoparticle assembly. The assay can be implemented via three 
steps: a single-strand specific nuclease reaction that allows the enzyme to truncate the 
mutant DNA, a purification step using capture probe-gold nanoparticles and centrifugation, 
and a hybridization reaction that induces detector probe-gold nanoparticles, capture 
probe-gold nanoparticles and the target DNA to form large DNA-linked three-dimensional 
aggregates of Au nanoparticles. At high temperature (63°C in the present case), the purple 
color of the perfect-match solution would not change to red, while a mismatched solution 
becomes red as the assembled gold nanoparticles separate. Using melting analysis, the 
position of the point mutation could be identified. This assay provides a convenient 
colorimetric detection that enables point-mutation identification without the need for 
expensive mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning SNP 
detection based on a single-strand specific nuclease reaction and a gold nanoparticle 
assembly.

target DNA at adjacent positions, while a mismatch in one of the two adjacent positions 
failed the ligation. However, mismatch identification with enzymatic reactions such as 
ligation work well in solution, but the reaction conditions typically need to be modified to 
work well on the gold surfaces.14,15 Furthermore, these ligation methods cannot detect a 
single nucleotide mismatch which is not at adjacent positions of the two ssDNA probes.  
 The single-strand specific nucleases catalyze the degradation of single-stranded DNA 
and RNA endonucleolytically to yield 5´-phosphoryl-terminated products. The nucleases 
prefer ssDNA over dsDNA by 30,000-fold16,17 and are used for SNP detection.5-7 A single 
nucleotide mismatch was detected when the probe and target DNA was not a perfect match. 
However, these methods used mass spectrometry or gel electrophoresis for the 
discrimination of fragments produced by endonuclease cleavage.5-7 These procedures are 
time-consuming and relatively high cost. 
In this paper, we report a newly developed method to detect SNP based on an ssDNA 
nuclease reaction and a gold nanoparticle assembly. As described below, this method has 
several advantages. Unlike the ligation method which detects a single nucleotide mismatch 
only at adjacent positions of the two probes, this new method can detect a single nucleotide 
mismatch at different positions of the detector probe. It also identifies the position of a single 
nucleotide mismatch using melting analysis. This method is relatively low cost and fast 
compared with mass spectrometry or a gel electrophoresis method.  
twice, the colloid was resuspended in 0.01% azide, 0.3 M NaCl, pH 7, 10 mM PB solution at 
a final concentration of 10 nM, and stored at 4 °C. 
 
Quantitation of Alkanethiol-Oligonucleotides Loaded on Nanoparticles. The 
measurements were described before.9,18 However, a solution of 12.8mM I2 and 34mM KI 
was used instead of a solution of KCN and K3Fe(CN)6 to dissolve the gold nanoparticles. 
The surface coverage of probe DNA was estimated using a fluorescein probe (Table 1). The 
fluorescence maximums (measured at 494 nm) were converted to molar concentrations of 
the fluorescein-alkanethiol modified oligonucleotide by interpolation from a standard linear 
calibration curve. Standard curves were prepared with known concentrations of 
fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides using identical buffer pH and salt concentrations. The 
average number of oligonucleotides per particle was obtained by dividing the measured 
oligonucleotide molar concentration by the original Au nanoparticle concentration. The 
estimated particle surface area was 1.26 x 10-11 cm2.  
 
Point-Mutation Detection. Figure 1 is a schematic description of the gold nanoparticle 
assembly and ssDNA nuclease reaction-based assay in this study. The appropriate 
oligonucleotide target (40 pmole) was mixed with the assay probe which was 
complementary to the target DNA. The conditions of the ssDNA nuclease reaction were 
experimental procedures are described in the Experimental Section. The target DNA and 
assay probe were mixed, and the ssDNA nuclease reactions were executed as previously 
described.17 After the reaction, the capture probe-gold nanoparticle and the anti-assay probe 
were added in the solution at 40 °C. The capture probe-gold nanoparticle has a 20-base 
complementarity to the target DNA. The anti-assay probe is 10 bases shorter than the target. 
It has a 30-base complementarity to the assay probe and a 10-base complementarity to the 
capture probe. The concentration of the anti-assay probe is designed to be tenfold higher 
than that of the target DNA to allow most of the assay probes to bind to the anti-assay probe, 
not the target DNA. This also allows most of the target DNA to bind to the capture 
probe-gold nanoparticle, not the assay probe. The mixing temperature is designed to be 40 
°C to prevent binding between the capture probe and the anti-assay probe which have only a 
10-base complementarity to each other. The temperature also prevents the binding between 
the complex of the assay probe- anti-assay probe and the target DNA which have a 10-base 
complementarity to each other. The target DNA- capture probe-gold nanoparticle assembly 
was purified by centrifugation at 40 °C. The colloid was mixed with the detector probe-gold 
nanoparticles whose amount was the same as the capture detector probe-gold nanoparticles. 
The solutions were subjected to colorimetric or UV-vis analysis as described before.9

bases, and 36 bases, respectively. The spectra of these three samples are clearly different 
from that of the perfect-match sample. This indicates that the point mutations for these three 
samples are detectable. However, the difference between the spectra of M1 and the perfect 
match is small. This may be due to the fact that there is only a one-base difference between 
M1 and the perfect match after the ssDNA- nuclease cut.   
Melting analysis. To find the point-mutation site, melting analysis was applied. Figure 5 
shows the UV-vis spectra of nanoparticle probes with the mung-bean-nuclease-treated target 
at different temperatures. At room temperature, the solution was purple and the λmax was at 
560 nm. The λmax shift started at 64 °C. The detailed melting analysis at the absorbance ratio 
of λ700 to λ400 is shown in the inset in Figure 5. The melting curve reveals that the melting 
temperature (Tm) for the perfect match is 67 °C. The melting temperatures for 
Mung-Bean-nuclease treated PM, M1, M2, M3, and M4 are 67, 65.2, 62.2, 59.4, and 55.6 °C, 
respectively (Fig. 6). In Figure 6, each column represents the mean of five measurements 
from five separate experiments. The 95% confidence interval for each mean is between the 
error bars. Some of them are clearly distinguishable from each other. The 95% confidence 
interval for mung-bean-nuclease-treated M2’s Tm is between 61.4°C and 63°C. This is not 
close to the intervals for M1’s or M3’s, indicating that the point mutation of M2 is detectable 
and that the position is identified using the proposed method. However, the interval for M1 
is very close to that of PM. The point mutation of M1 may not be detectable.
