Inventive Problem Solving). It is a systematic method for providing 
valid suggestions to meet the requirements of inventive steps. Su-Field 
analytic method, deduced from TRIZ method, is one of the inventive 
problem solving tools that can be used to analyze and improve the 
efficacy of the technological system. By possessing a symbolic system 
and transformation rules, the Su-Field analysis model can assist 
designers to diagnose and solve most design problems. This study 
proposes an innovative design and problem-solving process, based on 
Su-Field modeling method integrated with extension of 
matter-element.  
This research tries to integrating “extension of matter-element“ with 
the Su-Field modeling procedure to improve the efficiency and extent 
of concept evolutions. We make use of extensibility of matter-element 
to exchange the descriptions of design problems and solutions into 
creative fields. The concrete result includes, 
1. Evaluate the differences and benefits between Su-Field modeling 
procedure and matter-element modeling procedure. 
2. Assess possibility and advantage to combine construction of 
symbolic system in Su-Field model and the transformation and 
extension of matter-elements. 
3. Introducing concept extension of matter-element into symbolic 
developments to derive out more creative solutions. 
4. An innovative design case, stapleless stapler, successfully 
demonstrates that the proposed design process is feasible and 
efficient. 
 
Keywords—TRIZ, Su-Field, Matter-Element, Extension theory. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HROUGH creative education, the compatriots’ abilities of 
innovation and problem solving will be increased so that 
the management and research abilities of enterprises will also 
be improved. Possessed innovation ability, no matter engaged 
in any trade and office, can all promote working efficiency and 
innovative pattern. Thus, develop the suitable innovative 
method become the most urgent need. TRIZ, providing the 
guidance to invention, is such a systematic method to meet 
demand.  
Before cold war era between east and west, the research of 
TRIZ has been the state secret as Soviet Union. But TRIZ 
method is wide for western countries gradually knows after the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, and become the method that 
the extremely authoritative innovative problem solving. TRIZ 
is TIPS (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) Russian 
synonym word, it means whether it is the methods of question 
to answer, Savransky (2000) think TRIZ method is that a 
answer based on human knowledge invents the question 
systems approach, Altshuller (the father of TRIZ)[3] have 
explained the deduction course innovated and invented in detail. 
Hsiao (1999) point out that the engineers still adopt 
Brainstorming method to create new idea although lack of 
systematic procedure, limitation of engineers’ knowledge base, 
engineer’s psychological obstacle and so on are the 
shortcomings of Brainstorming method. In the design process 
of innovation, limitation of designer’s knowledge field, 
habitual thinking course, is the obstacle appeared in innovation 
procedure, especially using the open thinking methods. The 
TRIZ method can assists the designer in the concept 
development stage to expand to the knowledge domain that 
oneself is not skillful at, and has provided a systematic design 
procedure to define the design problem more distinct and get 
the innovative idea in design processes. 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economic Professor 
Thurow in its work” The Future of Capitalism “once mentioned 
that this is the artificial intelligence industry time, the 
technological development can support enterprise’s long-term 
competitive advantage of the business circles. No matter which 
kind of industry, if can’t research and develop low cost, high 
quality and concurrently innovative products to maintain their 
competitive advantage, will compete finally the intense market 
elimination.[23] Therefore the question of maintaining the 
innovative skills of enterprises, increasing productivity etc. 
becomes the main factor that needs to overcome in order to keep 
enterprise’s competitiveness. The appearance of TRIZ method 
can aim at these factors, provides vividly systematic solution. 
Su-Field analysis, one of the major tools which the TRIZ 
method deducts, is a useful tool for identifying problems in a 
technical system and finding innovative solution to these 
identified problems.[16] Using Su-Field analysis method can 
analyze and improve the function of the technological system. 
Altshuller and his colleagues, the researchers of TRIZ, 
graphically represent a Su-Field model as a triangle. According 
to TRIZ, the rationale of creating a Su-Field model is that a 
system, with the ultimate objective to achieve a function, 
normally consists of two substances and a field. The term S1 is 
used to represent an object that needs to be manipulated. The 
term S2 is a tool to act upon S1. Both substances can be as simple 
as a single element or as complicated as a big system with many 
components, which can also be explained by individual 
Su-Field models. The States of substances can be typical 
physical forms (e.g., gas, liquid and solid), interim or composite 
forms (e.g., aerosol, power, porous). The field is the needed 
energy to enable the interaction between the substances. 
Likewise, the field can refer to a broad range of energy, 
including mechanism, chemistry, physics, acoustics, optics and 
radiations.[16]

procedure of matter and try to employ to resolve contradictive 
problems. 
The extension method was derived from the extension theory 
that involves the matter-element theory and extension 
mathematics. The major research subject of extension theory is 
incompatible problem in the real world. The expression make 
qualitative and quantitative analysis mixed, describing the real 
world further and visually, providing another way of resolving 
contradictions. Its applications and the research expand to each 
domain, includes: trade, economics, sociology, management, 
engineering, strategy, etc. [25-31] 
On the basis of extension method, the results of concept design 
research are described as follows: 
1. A study on the extensible expression method of concept 
design knowledge: Based on the concept design of typical 
product, analyze and sum up profound knowledge and 
innovative thinking rules in the concept design process, 
utilizing matter-element and event-element, describe 
formalization to the function, principle, layout structure in 
conceptual design, construct corresponding models of 
matter-element and event-element.[29] Profound knowledge 
of design can be described by using extending tree or 
corresponding extension methods. Relatively, function and 
function relationship can also be described by extension 
analysis of function and corresponding connotation. 
Therefore, the systematic diagrams of functions will be 
constructed to providing an integrated model to complete the 
conceptual function design. 
2. Construct the rhombus thinking model of the conceptual 
design process: Set up function decomposing and synthesis 
multistage rhombus thinking model. Started from a certain 
main function matter-element, along different branches 
separated into different sub-function matter-elements to 
have a variety of alternative routes so as to realize extending 
thinking of function creative design. Then, according to 
criteria such as the feasibility, quality, true or false, 
compatibility, etc. to evaluate the extension results and 
select qualified few matter-elements, thus realize the 
convergent thinking process.[19] 
3. Transformation of function matter-element and event- 
element: Replacement, decomposition, addition/ deletion 
and expansion/contraction are four basic methods for the 
matter-element transformation. Overall, they are conductive 
to exchanging or to synthesizing different matter-elements. 
As to incompatible matter and opposite matter, adopt 
transforming bridge, by adjusting main indicator according 
to incompatible feedbacks and using matter-element 
transformation to vary the compatibility. Make the 
incompatible question and opposite goal turn into the 
compatible question and mutual goal, respectively. 
4. Decision-making, evaluation, redesign of concept design: 
Considering the constraints, prerequisite condition and 
compatibility of the design process, adopt extensive 
decision-making and referee method to evaluate the 
sensitivity, technology, economy and social assessment of 
suggestive scheme. Repeat these steps until achieving the 
optimal design.  
Basic disciplines that extension method involves are quite 
comprehensive, for example: philosophy, mathematics, 
systematic science, intellection science, control theory, 
information theory, management science and technological 
theory. Attempt to formalize the procedure of problem solving 
by set up the matter-element model to develop unique logic 
operation method and technology. 
The experts familiar with TRIZ will use the Su-field analysis 
method to analyze the effect relation between the components 
within system, but often employed contradiction matrix method 
instead of Su-field method while innovating and designing 
actually. And also has some scholars to have the negative 
appraisal to this method, they thought that the Su-field method 
is worthless, but also had some scholars saying that the Su-field 
method was not well enough. Therefore, in this research, we 
hope to improve the incomplete properties and feasibility of 
Su-field method by integrated with extension method, in order 
to provide perfect approach in each field. An innovative design 
case, stapleless stapler, successfully demonstrates that the 
proposed design process is feasible and efficient. 
 
III. INTEGRATING EXTENSION METHOD WITH SU-FIELD MODEL 
This research tries to integrating “extension of matter- 
element“ with the Su-Field modeling procedure to improve the 
efficiency and extent of concept evolutions. We make use of 
extensibility of matter-element to exchange the descriptions of 
design problems and solutions into creative fields.  
A. Symbolic System of Su-field Model[15] 
A graphical model of a minimal working technique in TRIZ 
is called Substance-Field, or Su-Field. Su-Field Analysis is an 
instrument for modeling the most important parts of TS and TP 
(technical systems and technological processes) for the 
particular problem and identifying the core of a problem related 
to this technique. Su-Field models and Su-Field Analysis, 
created by G. S. Altshuller, provide a fast, simple description of 
subsystems and their interactions in an operation zone and 
period via a well-formulated model of the technique in which 
all subsystems, inputs, and outputs are known or can be quite 
easily determined. Any technique can be presented as the 
ordered set of Su-Fields. 
As any model of nature, society, or technique, a Su-Field 
model has some simplifications and conditional agreements, 
which are described in this section. The term substance (S) has 
been used in TRIZ to refer to a material object of any level of 
complexity. S can be a single element or complex system. The 
states of substances include not only the typical physical states 
but also a large number of in-between and compound states as 
well as those stateshaving special thermal, electrical, magnetic, 
optical, and other characteristics. Substance is itself a 
hierarchical system. Altshuller and his colleagues, the 
researchers of TRIZ, graphically represent a Su-Field model as 
a triangle. According to TRIZ, the rationale of creating a 
Su-Field model is that a system, with the ultimate objective to 
achieve a function, normally consists of two substances and a 
field. The term S1 is used to represent an object that needs to be 
manipulated. The term S2 is a tool to act upon S1. Both 
substances can be as simple as a single element or as 
complicated as a big system with many components, which can 
also be explained by individual Su-Field models. The term field

The extensible properties of matter-element, event-element and 
relationship-element, comprising: divergence, expansibility, 
relevance and implication. While solving design problems 
based on Su-field model, diversity and creativity, the 
advantages of “extenics” method will be imported by 
implementing the extensibility of matter-element, 
event-element and relationship-element. Thus, the solution will 
not be limited by standard solutions but be inspired. A patent 
successfully demonstrate that the proposed innovative design 
process is feasible and flexible. 
IV. ILLUSTRATIVE DESIGN CASE  
In this research, a design case “Stapleless stapler”, is adapt to 
explain and verify feasibility of the proposed design procedure. 
Traditional staplers use metal staples to bind papers. However, 
metal staples have inconspicuous but serious impact to 
environment. Thus, it is imperious to develop a “Stapleless 
stapler”. Design problem: “How to dispel the use of the staple 
under the principle of not influencing the function --binding”   
A. List Su-field model related to design problem 
The initial Su-field model is constructed according to 
operation situation and function of the traditional stapler and the 
course correlated to staples. Su-field model of the traditional 
stapler can be illustrated at least 3 types. It is essential that the 
present Su-field model should be conformed to the design 
problem. It should be avoided to illustrating a Su-field model 
that is irrelevant to the design problem. Inadequate model will 
confuse designer and make the solution procedures too 
complicated. 
In this case, the design purpose is eco-design, tending to 
reduce consumption of resources. Key problem of design case 
which needed to be settled is “How to eliminate the use of the 
staple without influencing the function—binding”. Among the 
illustrated Su-field models, the model as shown in Fig.6(a) 
seems to be the most suitable one. As shown in Fig.6, S1 
represents the metal staple, S2 represents the punch of stapler, 
and FME represents a mechanical pressure. This description of 
Su-field model is that the punch (S2) transmits mechanical 
pressure force (FME) to the metal staple (S1).[15] 
 
Fig.6 (a) Su-field model of the traditional stapler; (b) 
eliminate harmful substance S1; (c) Add new 
substance to complete Su-field model 
The metal staple (S1) is considered as the material 
component that harmful to environment. After eliminating it, 
this Su-field model becomes incomplete. Then, refer to 1st 
transformation rule, introduce a substance component 
(represent with S1’ here, in order to avoid confuse with the 
original material S1) to fill up the vacancy of model, make it 
keep function that bind. Similarly, the substance S1’ should 
bear the mechanical pressure (FME) force by the punch (S2) on 
the stapler. After performing transformation, Su-field model is 
illustrated as Fig.7. 
 
B. Integrated with Extension of Matter-Element 
The following steps are to transfer Su-field model to design 
prototype: 
1. Survey the entity component correlated to S1*. Besides the 
metal staple, we search for the replaceable subject by using 
the divergence of matter-element. 
2. Use extending tree method to build the transformation 
model for staple: A matter refers to multi- characteristics, a 
characteristic also mapped by matters. Thus, “one matter 
with multi-characteristics”, “one characteristic maps to 
multi-matters” , “one value maps to multi-matters”, “one 
matter, one value vs. multi- characteristics”, “one matter, 
one characteristic vs. multi-values” are the extending 
propositions of matter-element to resolve contradiction. 
The extension of matter-element, staple, can be expressed 
as, 
R1  = ( N, c1, vn)   
= (staple，material，plastic) 
= (staple，material，rope) 
= (staple，material，glue)  ......etc. 
R2  = (N, c2, vn)   
= (staple，binding method，staple binding) 
= (staple，binding method，rope binding) 
= (staple，binding method，glue binding) 
  ......etc. 
The extension of event-element, 
I1   = (d, b1, un) 
= (binding，binder，plastic) 
= (binding，binder，rope) 
= (binding，binder，glue)  ......etc. 
I2   = (d, b2, un)  
= (binding，objective，papers) ...... etc. 
I3   = (d, b3, un)  
= (binding，tighten effect，tight) ...... etc. 
I4   = (d, b4, un)  
= (binding，method，rope) ...... etc. 
The extension of relationship-element (relationship-element 
could be the binder, objective, imposer, effect, structure,etc.)
