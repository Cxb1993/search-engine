with simplex method to find the final solutions. 
The chaos nonlinear control design with variation in 
the dither amplitude parameter is also investigated. Both 
the LMI problem described above and the bounds of the 
variation interval of the dither amplitude parameter are 
solved by IROA. A case study is provided to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of dither and the fuzzy 
control strategy. 
2. System description and main results 
We begin with considering a type of nonlinear system, 
which is affine in the input and exhibits chaotic behavior: 
,)()( wuxgxfx ++=&          (1) 
where 1×∈ mRx  is the state vector, 1×∈ cRu  denotes the 
control input, and 1×∈ mRw  is disturbance with a 
known upper bound. Furthermore, nonlinear functions 
( )xf  and ( )xg  satisfies the Lipschitz condition of order 
1 for all x . 
To diminish the chaotic behavior, a dither, D(t), is 
injected into the nonlinear system. The corresponding 
dithered system of (1) can be described as: ( ) wuxgDxfx ++= )(,&       (2) 
If we denote the period as T, and divide each period, [t, 
t+T], into N subintervals, the duration of the n-th 
subinterval can be written as Tnα , where the duration 
parameter 
10 ≤≤ nα , 1

=∑
=
N
n
nα ,            (3) 
and the magnitude of dither in the subinterval is denoted 
as nβ .  
The first step to apply the PDC scheme is to represent 
the model of (2) as a fuzzy combination of the T–S fuzzy 
linear models. The Relaxed fuzzy model rule i:   
If ( )tz1  is 1iM  and L  and ( )tz p  is ipM  
Then  [ ] wuBxAx iiN

The corresponding fuzzy controller is described:

THEN xKu j−= , for .,,2,1 rj L=           (8)

can be formed by (8):

The main design method for the fuzzy control of the 
dithered fuzzy system is described by the following 
theorem. 
Theorem 1: If there exist positive-definite matrices P

then the closed-loop dithered fuzzy system (19) is 
uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and the control 
performance of (20) is guaranteed for the prescribed 
attenuation parameter ρ , where the bounding matrices 
iAΔ  and iBΔ  are defined in equation (16-17). Moreover, 
the closed-loop dithered fuzzy system is asymptotically 
stable in the large if ( ) 0=tWe .

The optimization problem is then defined as searching 
for Code to maximize or minimize the cost function h .  
The process of finding system parameters from 
collected data is defined as the system identification 
problem. First of all, we denote the unknown parameters 
as a , and formulate the system dynamics as ( ) ( )auxfwuxgxfx p ,,)( =++=& .   (29) 
Accordingly, the simulated response, denoted as ax ˆ , 
corresponding to an estimated parameter set, denoted as 
aˆ , is the solution of the following equation with the same 
initial conditions of (29): ( )auxfx apa ˆ,,ˆˆ =& .           (30) 
The cost function to be minimized in the identification 
problem can then be defined as: 
( ) ( ) ( )dttxtxahCost ftt
t a∫ == −== 0 ˆˆ ,   (31) 
where ( )tx  is the solution of (29), which may be 
collected from practical operation history or simulation 
results, and the input ( )tu  must be rich enough such 
that all representative system modes are excited.  
The determination of positive values  ,2 jiθ i1θ  and ρ  
in Theorem 1 corresponds to maximize the cost function: ( )( ){ } ,,,max),,( 12,12 ρρθθλρθθ −Φ−== ijijijiijihCost   (32) 
where )( jiΦλ  denotes the eigenvalues of the matrices 
jiΦ . The condition { } 0)(max, <Φ jiji λ  can be facilitated. 
3. Illustrative example 
Let us consider a Chua’s nonlinear circuit [17], shown 
in Fig. 1, as a chaotic system to be investigated. In the 
circuit, R = 1.558 Ω , H, 1/7=L  1C = 0.1 F, 2C = 2 F, 
and the nonlinear resistor, 
NR , is characterized by:

where D  is a dither input to be designed later, and 
( )tw1  is disturbance, which is assumed to be ( )1 sinw t= . 
Following the design procedure proposed in the previous 
section, the ∞H  control design of the chaotic system is 
preceded by the following steps. 
Step 1) Using the improved-RO strategy proposed in 
previous section, the parameters in the circuit were 
identified as: R = 1.575 Ω , H, 0.1428=L  1C = 0.0989 
F, 2C = 1.99 F, 99.3−=aG S, 098.0−=bG S, and 
99.0=E V. 
The data generated for identification are collected from 
simulation results of (34) with randomly generated inputs 
( ) ( ) ( ) [ ].5,5,,
21
−∈tvtiti uuu  Correctness of the identified 
relaxed fuzzy model can be easily examined by 
comparing simulation results of it with that of the 
original chaotic system. Records of the searching 
procedures and comparison of simulation results are 
omitted here due to restriction on available space. 
The dither, D , was designed to be a square wave of 
amplitudes 5.121 =−== βββ  with 2=N . The 
dynamic equations of the circuit can then be rewritten as
