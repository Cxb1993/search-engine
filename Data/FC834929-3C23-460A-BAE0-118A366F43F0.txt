Abstract 
In this paper we propose a new numerical integration of second order boundary value 
problems resulting from the elastica of slender rods under different loading conditions and 
boundary conditions. We will construct a compact space shooting method for finding the 
unknown initial conditions. The key point is based on the construction of a one-step Lie 
group element G and the establishment of a generalized mid-point Lie group element G(r) 
by using the mean value theorem. Then, by imposing G = G(r) we can search the missing 
initial condition through a closed-form solution in terms of the weighting factor . 
The Lie-group shooting method is very effective for large deflection problems of elastica 
even the problem maybe include multiple solutions.

Probably the first exact analysis of finite deflections of columns under non-Eulerian load-
ing behavior is due to Stern (1979). He considered elastica for a cantilever column loaded
via a rigid rod with sliding upper end and determined the regions of stable and unstable
post-buckling path. The direction of force loading the column is here no longer constant in
space. More recent results concerning with the non-Eulerian forces and based on elastica
were made by Wilson and Snyder (1988) and Kandakis (1992).
The advantages of Euler’s approach are connected with exactness of the analysis and with
applicability within the whole range of loadings and deflections. However, the results are not
so perspicuous and the stability of postbuckling behavior is difficult to be estimated. Koiter
(1945) proposed an alternative approach based on energy criterion of stability combined with
perturbations, namely expansions into power series of a certain small parameter  charac-
terizing deformations. This parameter should be defined as a suitable norm for function or
functions describing deformation, monotonically increasing during the buckling process. In
the simplest case of a cantilever column usually the deflection at the free end is chosen as
that parameter: it may be regarded as a Chebyshev’s norm for deflections. From among
other proposals defining  we mention that by Riks (1979) with the current length of the
equilibrium path, obviously increasing during the process, and by Privalova and Seyranian
(1997) with the Gaussian norm for the deflection angle.
The signs of coefficients of expansion of the loading parameter P into power series of 
determine stability of post-buckling behavior. Such expansions can also be derived directly
from the governing nonlinear equation of the problem without energy considerations. Then
the manoeuvre proposed by Croll (1971), orthogonalization of the expanded equation with a
suitably chosen function and integration by parts, makes it possible to evaluate a higher-order
expansion coefficient for P by using just a lower-order deflection function.
For some applications it is important to know relations of the type  = (P ), inverse with
respect to those described above. Such relations may be obtained for stable post-buckling
behavior. For a prismatic column under Eulerian force it was derived by Zyczkowski (1991)
who used inversion of the relevant power series for P = P () [Zyczkowski (1965)]. However,
the convergence of such a series is rather poor; it can be improved by a suitable extrapolation
procedure, e.g., Zyczkowski (1998).
Koiter’s theory and related approaches were extensively developed, mainly in connection
with shell buckling problems since initial post-buckling behavior of shells is in most cases
unstable. Moreover, for imperfect shells it determines upper critical loading in terms of the
imperfection parameter. Many results were presented in the survey papers by Hutchinson
and Koiter (1970), Budiansky (1974), Potier-Ferry (1987), and in the books by Thompson
and Hunt (1973), Dym (1974), Huseyin (1975), Bazant and Cedolin (1991), Troger and
Steindl (1991), Nguyen (1995), and Atanackovic (1997). More recent papers devoted to the
post-buckling behavior of prismatic elastic columns were Plaut (1979) and Kolkka (1984)
for multiparameter loading, Plaut (1978), Kounadis (1991), Rao and Rao (1991) for non-
conservative loading, Haslach (1985), Kounadis and Mallis (1987), Szymczak and Mikulski
(1990) for effects of material non-linearity, Tauchert and Lu (1987), Hui (1988), Lee and Waas
(1996), Wu and Zhong (1999) for columns on elastic foundation, Damil and Potier-Ferry
(1990) for higher-order expansion terms, Luongo and Pignataro (1992) for nearly symmetric
structures, Godoy (1996) for the dependence on certain parameters, e.g. responsible for
deformation of a cross-section, and Beda (1996) and Wu (1998) for secondary buckling.
Most of the research that deals with large deflection problems has used four different
2
To remedy these two defects of the linear theory we must consider the nonlinear equation
(1) again, but with a further differential of it with respect to s, resulting in
θ′′(s) + p2 sin θ(s) = 0, θ′(0) = θ′(L) = 0, (2)
where dκ/ds = d2θ/ds2 and u′(s) = sin θ were used. The boundary conditions are obtained
by imposing the simply support conditions at two ends.
On the other hand, we can also derive the governing equation of the buckling problem
of a cantilever beam under a transversal loading [Ramachandra and Roy (2001); Kumar,
Ramachandra and Roy (2004)]:
θ′′(s) + p2 cos θ(s) = 0, θ(0) = θ′(L) = 0. (3)
Depending on the precise mode of loading and the nature of the rod, the transition to a
buckled state can be very rapid. If the loading is further increased the deflection of the rod
from its straight state is likewise increased. If this entire process is repeated, the rod may
well buckle into another configuration such as the reflection of the first state through a plane
of symmetry. The performance of a whole series of such experiments on different rods would
lead to the observation that the buckling loads and the nature of buckled states depend
upon the material and shape of the rod and upon the manner in which it is supported at its
ends. It can also be observed that the the experimental results are highly sensitive to slight
deviations of the rod from perfect straightness or of the load from perfect symmetry. The
study of buckling for different bodies is one of the richest sources of important problems in
nonlinear solid mechanics, e.g., Antman (1995).
The present objective is to appropriately integrate the governing nonlinear ODEs, such
that the solution satisfies all the boundary conditions. Since the governing nonlinear ODEs
are generally nonintegrable, the most efficient and accurate way to integrate the nonlinear
vector fields is to employ some direct integration schemes. However, in order to effectively
employ one of these techniques, sufficient information on initial conditions (at one of the two
boundaries) is needed a priori, i.e., boundary value problem (BVP) needs to be posed as a
conditional initial value problem (IVP). To begin with, some of the initial conditions of this
conditional IVP are not known and they would have to be optimally selected via a genetic
search so as to satisfy all the known boundary conditions. In this paper we propose a new
method for the computation of the following second-order nonlinear two-point BVPs:
w′′ = H(x, w, w′), a < x < b, (4)
under one of the following boundary conditions:
w(a) = α, w′(b) = β, (5)
w′(a) = α, w′(b) = β, (6)
which include Eqs. (3) and (2) as special cases. After developing the Lie-group shooting
method for these problems in the following sections, one would find that the present method
is very effective to find the unknown missing initial condition, for example, θ(0) for Eq. (2)
or θ′(0) for Eq. (3).
Eq. (4) together with Eq. (5) is called the Cauchy-Neumann type BVP, while Eq. (4)
together with Eq. (6) is called the Neumann type BVP. The last problem will be discussed

BVPs. It will be clear that our method can be applied to the elastica BVPs, since we are
able to search the missing initial condition through a closed-form solution in terms of r in
a compact space of r ∈ (0, 1), where the factor r is used in a generalized mid-point rule for
the Lie group of one-step GPS.
3.1 The GPS
Let us write Eqs. (15) and (16) in a vector form:
y˙ = f(t,y), (19)
where
y :=
[
y1
y2
]
, f :=
[
y2
f(t, y1, y2)
]
. (20)
Liu (2001) has embedded Eq. (19) into an augmented system:
X˙ :=
d
dt
[
y
‖y‖
]
=
[
02×2
f(t,y)
‖y‖
fT(t,y)
‖y‖ 0
] [
y
‖y‖
]
:= AX, (21)
where A is an element of the Lie algebra so(2, 1) satisfying
ATg + gA = 0 (22)
with
g :=
[
I2 02×1
01×2 −1
]
(23)
a Minkowski metric. Here, I2 is the identity matrix, and the superscript T stands for the
transpose.
The augmented variable X satisfies the cone condition:
XTgX = y · y − ‖y‖2 = 0. (24)
Accordingly, Liu (2001) has developed a group-preserving scheme (GPS) as follows:
Xk+1 = G(k)Xk, (25)
where Xk denotes the numerical value of X at the discrete tk, and G(k) ∈ SOo(2, 1) satisfies
GTgG = g, (26)
det G = 1, (27)
G00 > 0, (28)
where G00 is the 00th component of G. In Section 6.1 we will write a GPS explicitly.
3.2 Generalized mid-point rule
Applying scheme (25) on Eq. (21) with a specified initial condition X(t0) = X0 we can
compute the solution X(t) by GPS. Assuming that the stepsize used in GPS is h = (1−t0)/K,
6
From Eqs. (30) and (37) it follows that
yf = y0 + ηF, (40)
‖yf‖ = a‖y0‖+ bF · y0‖F‖ , (41)
where
η :=
(a− 1)F · y0 + b‖y0‖‖F‖
‖F‖2 . (42)
Substituting
F =
1
η
(yf − y0) (43)
into Eq. (41) we obtain
‖yf‖
‖y0‖ = a + b
(yf − y0) · y0
‖yf − y0‖‖y0‖ , (44)
where
a = cosh
(
(1− t0)‖yf − y0‖
η
)
, (45)
b = sinh
(
(1− t0)‖yf − y0‖
η
)
(46)
are obtained by inserting Eq. (43) for F into Eqs. (38) and (39).
Let
cos φ :=
[yf − y0] · y0
‖yf − y0‖‖y0‖ , (47)
S := (1− t0)‖yf − y0‖, (48)
and from Eqs. (44)-(46) it follows that
‖yf‖
‖y0‖ = cosh
(
S
η
)
+ cos φ sinh
(
S
η
)
. (49)
By defining
Z := exp
(
S
η
)
, (50)
we obtain a quadratic equation for Z from Eq. (49):
(1 + cos φ)Z2 − 2‖yf‖‖y0‖ Z + 1− cos φ = 0. (51)
The solution is found to be
Z =
‖yf‖
‖y0‖ +
√(
‖yf‖
‖y0‖
)2
− 1 + cos2 φ
1 + cos φ
, (52)
8
in which Z is calculated by
Z =
√
c2+B2√
c2+A2
+
√
c2+B2
c2+A2
− 1 + cos2 φ
1 + cos φ
, (65)
where
cos φ =
A(B − A)√
(A− B)2√c2 + A2 . (66)
The above three equations were obtained from Eqs. (53), (52) and (47) by inserting Eq. (20)
for y.
When compare Eq. (63) with Eq. (36), and with the aid of Eqs. (32), (33) and (59)-(62)
we obtain
rA + (1− r)B = 0, (67)
A− B + η
ξ
fˆ = 0, (68)
where
fˆ(r) := f(t0 + r(1− t0), c, 0), (69)
ξ :=
√
c2 + [rA + (1− r)B]2. (70)
It can be seen that fˆ is a very simple function of r. This result is due to the fact of
yˆ1 = rc + (1− r)c = c and yˆ2 = rA + (1− r)B = 0 by Eqs. (61), (62) and (67).
The above derivation of the governing equations (64)-(70) is based on by equating the
two F’s in Eqs. (36) and (58). It also means that the two Lie groups defined by Eqs. (31) and
(55) are equal. Under this sense we may call our shooting technique a Lie-group shooting
method.
From Eqs. (67) and (70) it follows that
ξ = c (71)
is a positive constant. Hence, from Eqs. (67)-(69) and (71) we obtain an algebraic equation
for A:
H(A) = Ac + η0fˆ = 0, (72)
where
Z =
√
c2 + B2 +
√
B2√
c2 + A2 −
√
A2
, (73)
η0 =
(1− t0)
√
A2
ln Z
. (74)
Here B = rA/(r − 1) has a different sign with A.
Eq. (72) can be used to solve A for the given r. If A is available, we can return to
integrate Eqs. (15)-(18) by a suitable forward IVP solver.
10
We have derived the closed-form solutions to calculate the slope A for each r in its admissible
range. We can integrate the (y, t)-IVP in Eqs. (15)-(18) by the following GPS method [Liu
(2005)]:
yn+1 = yn +
sinh
(
h‖fn‖
‖yn‖
)
‖yn‖‖fn‖+
[
cosh
(
h‖fn‖
‖yn‖
)
− 1
]
fn · yn
‖fn‖2 fn, (84)
where
fn = f(tn,yn). (85)
6.2 Adjusting A for the other two type BVPs
For the Cauchy-Neumann type BVPs, we have employed the symmetric extension technique
to construct the canonical equations. Therefore the target used to adjust the slope A is
y˙(0) = 0.
For a trial r in the admissible range, we calculate A and then numerically integrate
Eqs. (15)-(18) from t = −1 to t = 0, and compare the end value of yr2(0) with the exact one
y2(0) = 0. If |yr2(0)| is smaller than a given tolerance error , then the process of finding
solution is finished. Otherwise, we need to calculate the end values of y2(0) corresponding
to a different r1 < r or r2 > r, which are denoted by y
r1
2 (0) and y
r2
2 (0), respectively. If
yr12 (0)y
r
2(0) < 0, then there exists one root between r1 and r; otherwise, the root is located
between (r, r2). Then, we apply the half-interval method to find a suitable r, which requires
us to calculate Eqs. (15)-(18) at each of the calculation of yr2(0), until |yr2(0)| is smaller
enough to satisfy the criterion of |yr2(0)| ≤ .
In principle, we can increase the accuracy by imposing a smaller  on the shooting error,
which however requires more iterations. Since the numerical method is very stable we can
quickly pick up the correct value of r through some trials and modifications. Therefore, in
the following calculations of another examples we do not use the above half-interval method
again to pick up the weighting factor r.
7 The Neumann problem
For Eqs. (4) and (6), in addition Eq. (7) we use the following transformation:
y(t) = w(x) +
1
2
k1t
2 + k2t = w(x) +
1
2
(β − α)(a− b)t2 + α(a− b)t, (86)
and then, Eqs. (4) and (6) can be reduced to
y¨ = f(t, y, y˙), (87)
y˙(0) = 0, y˙(1) = 0, (88)
where
f(t, y, y˙) := (b− a)2H(a + (b− a)t, y − k1t2/2− k2t, (y˙ − k1t− k2)/(b− a)) + k1. (89)
The equation, required to determine the unknown y(0) = C, can be obtained by a similar
argument as that in Section 3. For this purpose let us write
y˙1 = y2, (90)
12
A similar argument as that in the above leads to D = −C.
The case of cos φ = 1 implies that C(D − C) > 0 by Eq. (94). However, the same
argument as that in the above leads to D = −C. This results in C(D − C) = −2C2 < 0,
which contradicts to C(D − C) > 0. It means that there exists no such case that cos φ = 1.
Therefore, by inserting D = −C into Eq. (98) we have the following equation to solve C:
f(r, (2r − 1)C, 0) = 0, (103)
no matter C is positive or negative. If C is available, we can return to integrate Eqs. (90)-
(93) by a suitable forward IVP solver with y1(0) = C and y2(0) = A.
8 Numerical examples
8.1 Example 1
Let us consider the Euler problem of a slender rod with simple support subjecting to a
compressive load as shown by Eq. (2) with L = pi. The above equation is simply transformed
by t = s/pi and y = θ into Eqs. (87) and (88) with
f(t, y, y˙) = −p2pi2 sin y. (104)
Substituting Eq. (104) into Eq. (103) we obtain
f(r, (2r − 1)C, 0) = −p2pi2 sin[(2r − 1)C] = 0, (105)
which means that
C =
kpi
2r − 1 (106)
for some integer k.
Then we use the GPS method to integrate the following equations:
y˙1 = y2, (107)
y˙2 = −p2 sin y1, (108)
y1(0) = C, (109)
y2(0) = 0, (110)
with C given by Eq. (106) with k = 1. Here, y1 and y2 represent respectively θ and θ
′. Let
r run in the interval of (0, 0.5) and we plot the θ(pi) in Fig. 1 under the load p = 3.1. It
can be seen that there are many intersection points of the curve with the zero line θ(pi) = 0,
which means that the Euler problem has multiple solutions.
In Figs. 2-7 we plot these solutions in the planes (s, θ) and (x, u), where
u =
∫ s
0
sin θ(ξ)dξ =
−y2
pip2
, (111)
x =
∫ s
0
cos θ(ξ)dξ. (112)
The corresponding r is marked in each figure.

    學術是沒有分界的，不會因為你是工程背景就被限制住只能做實務，學數
學的人就只能去發展理論。對於一個卓越的研究者應兼容並蓄。對於語文的學
習，也有了更深一層的體認，來自不同國家的學者，皆使用共通的語言(英語)
來溝通，對於英語的掌握，對一個土博士而言更是要去好好面對，並走出國際，
跟上潮流。 
 
三、建議 
 本次研討會給我的感覺是學術交流與國際視野開拓的重要性。國際間，針
對各種專業領域不乏會有幾位知名學者。在交流的過程中，可從提問與答辯間，
解答許多的疑惑；亦可在私下討論時，了解每位學者間所關注的焦點，能使我
們對整體研究趨勢有些了解，有助我們掌握新的研究方向。因此，極力鼓勵教
育部或國科會往後仍能盡量補助國內博士生，參與國際學術會議，開拓其國際
視野；同時，也希望能多多補助支持國內大專院校，承辦一些大型國際會議，
使無法獲得出國補助的學生及國內年輕老師，也能參與國際會議，增加與國外
學者進行交流的機會，亦可提升台灣在國際上的知名度。 
 
四、攜回資料名稱及內容 
    與會後攜回的主要資料，除了該會議的詳細議程外，以及一本大會論文集
(CD-ROM)。 
 
 美國邁阿密學術之旅： 
一、 參加會議經過 
    本次會議為 ICCES2007 International Conference on Computational & 
Experimental Engineering and Sciences，於1月3日至1月8日在美國邁阿密Beach 
Resort & Spa Hotel 舉行。本次大會以工程及科學計算方法為主題，六天會議
分別為六個 Sessions 同時進行，與會人數大約二百多人，是一個大型的國際學
術會議，其中不乏國際知名學者參與。 
 
二、與會心得 
首先，感謝國科會補助出國參加國際研討會，使申請人能有機會參與這次
ICCES2007 國際會議。本次係受大會邀請以 Keynote Lecture 進行
“以無網格正則化積分方程法解任意內外域的拉氏方程問題＂（A 
meshless regularized integral equation method (MRIEM) for 
Laplace equation in arbitrary interior or exterior domains）
演講，並擔任 Session F06 的 Chair. 
這次與會人數有二百多人，討論之熱烈，可想而知。除了會議進行時的討
論外，連中場 Coffee Break的時間，也可看到許許多多學者仍不斷針對他們的疑
問與報告者進行討論，討論之熱烈，是我參加國內研討會時，從未見過的景象，
值得國內學者省思。 
    在會議上，可看到許多學者所提出的計算方法，在各個不同領域上的應用，
讓我的眼界放寬並與其他學者尋求開闢新研究領域，增加國際學術研究的互動
關係，避免在國內閉門造車。藉此可以了解目前數值計算方法的脈動。討論時，
也讓我了解到其他學者的思考脈絡為何、關心的議題在哪？
