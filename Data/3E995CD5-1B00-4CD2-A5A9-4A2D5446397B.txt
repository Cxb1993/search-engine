I. Introduction 
The pervasiveness of handheld devices has lead to rapid growth in the demand on broadband 
wireless communication. However, insufficient bandwidth and serious propagation loss make 
traditional coaxial cable unsuitable for the transmission of wireless signals in the 
microwave/millimeter-wave (mm-wave) range. Therefore, the radio-over-fiber (RoF) system, 
which distributes radio-frequency (RF) signals from a central station (CS) to base stations (BS) 
over an optical fiber, is a promising approach because of its almost unlimited bandwidth and very 
low propagation loss [1-3]. 
RoF technology allows the concentration of RF signal processing and shared mm-wave 
components at a CS and makes BS simpler and more cost-effective. The generation and 
transmission of optical microwave or mm-wave signals are crucial to RoF systems. Optical RF 
signal generation or optical up-conversion using an external Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) 
based on double-sideband (DSB), single-sideband (SSB), and double-sideband with carrier 
suppression (DSBCS) modulation schemes have been demonstrated [3-7]. The DSB modulation 
signal undergoes performance fading problems because of fiber dispersion, which causes periodic 
degradation of the receiver sensitivity varying with the transmission length of standard single 
mode fiber (SSMF). The SSB modulation, which is generated by applying a π/2 phase difference 
between the two RF electrodes of the dual-electrode MZM (DD-MZM) biased at the quadrature 
point, is developed to overcome the performance fading. However, since the optical RF signals 
are weakly modulated because of the narrow linear region of MZM, those that undergo DSB and 
SSB modulations have inferior sensitivities because the optical modulation depth (OMD) is 
limited [4]. Recently, the DSBCS modulation has been demonstrated in the mm-wave range to 
have the best receiver sensitivity and overcome periodic performance fading due to fiber 
dispersion. Besides, since optical carrier is suppressed, a frequency doubling technique can be 
achieved to reduce the bandwidth requirement of optical RF transmitter [5]. 
In this project, we proposed two different setups for simultaneously generation and

erbium-doped fiber amplifier and then filtered by a tunable optical filter with a bandwidth of 0.4 
nm. After transmitted over standard single mode fiber (SSMF), the transmitted optical microwave 
signal is converted into an electrical microwave signal by a PIN PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 38 
GHz, and the converted electrical signal is amplified by an electrical amplifier. In the BB path, a 
low-pass filter with a 3 dB bandwidth of 622 MHz is inserted to reject the undesired RF 
components. In the other path, the microwave signal is down-converted (DC) by a mixer with a 
10 GHz clock, and then passes through a low-pass filter with a 3 dB bandwidth of 622 MHz. The 
eye diagrams of the DC and BB signals are shown in insets (iv) and (v) of Fig.1, respectively.

spectrum is 0.01nm. 
we can conclude that the power penalty for both the receiver sensitivities of the BB and DC 
signals using only one SD-MZM based DSBCS scheme is less than 1.4 dB after transmitted over 
100 km SSMF when the optical power ranges from 0 to 10 dBm. 
 
III. Hybrid Optical Access Network Integrating Fiber-to-the-home and 
Radio-over-fiber Systems 
The second part of this project proposes the simultaneous modulation and transmission of a 
1.25Gb/s on-off-keying (OOK) BB signal and a 20GHz 622Mb/s OOK RF signal using one 
external integrated modulator. The BB and RF signals are independently modulated and 
transmitted at the optical carrier and subcarrier, respectively. In the proposed system, the RF 
signal does not suffer periodic performance fading when it is transmitted over a standard single 
mode fiber (SSMF). The power penalties of both BB and RF signals are less than 0.2dB after 
transmission over 50km SSMF, revealing the feasibility of the system. 
Figure 4 schematically depicts the hybrid optical access network system. A BB signal is 
modulated on the optical carrier and a RF signal on the optical double sideband. An external 
integrated modulator using x-cut LiNbO3, consisting of three single-electrode MZM, is the key to 
generating RF and BB signals simultaneously. Two sub-MZMs (MZ-a and MZ-b) are embedded 
in each arm of the main modulator (MZ-c). The RF signal is generated at MZ-a biased at the 
minimum transmission point, using double-sideband with optical carrier suppression (DSBCS) 
 10
voltage (Vp-p) of 7V, limited by the RF amplifier. The optical RF signal is generated via MZ-a 
with half-wave voltage (Vπ) of 5.8V. The MZ-a is biased at the minimum transmission point to 
realize DSBCS modulation. The repetition frequency of the generated optical microwave is 
20GHz. The generated optical microwave is shown in inset (ii) of Fig. 5. The BB signal is a 
1.25Gb/s PRBS signal with a word length of 231-1; it is sent into MZ-b with Vπ of 5.6V. The eye 
diagram of the generated optical BB signal is shown in inset (iii) of Fig. 5. The optical RF and 
BB signals are combined in MZ-c with Vπ of 6.9V. The hybrid optical signals are amplified by an 
erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) to compensate for the loss of the external modulator, 
yielding a power of 0dBm before transmission over 50km SSMF. Following transmission over 
50km SSMF, the hybrid signals are preamplified by EDFA and then filtered by a tunable optical 
filter with a bandwidth of 0.4nm. At the remote node, the fiber grating with a 3dB bandwidth of 
4GHz is used to separate these two signals, as shown in inset (iv) and (v) of Fig. 5, and each 
signal is sent to the corresponding application. Both optical signals are individually detected by a 
PIN PD. For FTTH applications, the electrical BB signal is filtered by a electrical filter with a 
3dB bandwidth of 1.25GHz. For wireless applications, the electrical RF signal is down-converted 
by a mixer with a 20GHz clock before passing through a low-pass filter with a 3dB bandwidth of 
622MHz. The eye diagrams of BB and RF signals are shown in inset (vi) and (vii) of Fig. 5, 
respectively. Both RF and BB signals are tested by a BER tester and the receiver sensitivities are 
measured before EDFA pre-amplification. The fiber length is set to 25 and 50km.  
The system was carefully optimized by controlling the modulation index of both the RF and BB 
signal. Under optimal conditions for driving MZ-a and MZ-b, the receiver sensitivities of the RF 
and BB signals are -37.2dBm and -36.8dBm at BER of 10-9, respectively. Then the optical hybrid 
signals at an optical power of 0dBm are transmitted over 25km and 50km SSMF. Fig. 6 (a) plots 
the BER curves of the RF and BB signals. The power penalties of both signals at a BER of 10-9 
are less than 0.2dB, as shown in Fig. 6 (b).

IV. Impact of Nonlinear Transfer Function and Imperfect Splitting Ratio of 
MZM on Optical Up-Conversion Employing DSB-CS modulation scheme 
Generation of optical millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal using a Mach-Zehnder modulator 
(MZM) based on double-sideband (DSB), single-sideband (SSB), and double-sideband with 
carrier suppression (DSBCS) modulation schemes have been demonstrated for various 
applications, such as broadband wireless signals or optical up-conversion for 
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) radio-over-fiber (RoF) network, wideband 
surveillance, spread spectrum, and software-defined radio. Among these schemes, DS-BCS 
modulation offers the best receiver sensitivity, lowest spectral occupancy, the least stringent 
requirement of electrical bandwidth, and the smallest receiving power penalty after long 
transmission distance. Nonetheless, the inherent nonlinear E/O (electrical/optical) conversion 
response of a MZM is such that the signal quality of the optical millimeter-wave (mm-wave) 
suffers. Fabrication tolerances make a balanced 50/50 splitting ratio of the MZM’s Y-splitter 
particularly difficult to achieve. As a result, imbalanced MZMs have a finite extinction ratio (ER) 
and degrade the optical carrier suppression ratio (OCSR) using DSBCS modulation. At the end of 
this project, the effect of the MZM nonlinearity and imbalanced y-splitter on optical mm-wave 
generation by DSBCS modulation is theoretically and experimentally investigated. A novel 
approach with better performance and greater cost-effectiveness than dual-electrode MZM 
(DD-MZM) is presented to realize a DSBCS modulation scheme based on a single-electrode 
MZM (SD-MZM). 
A. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF MILLIMETER-WAVE GENERATION BY DSBCS 
MODULATION 
a. Generation of Mm-Wave Signal Using Balanced MZM 
Fig. 7 displays the principle of the optical mm-wave generation by the DSBCS modulation 
scheme. The power splitting ratio of two arms of a balanced MZM is 0.5. The electrical field at 
the output of the MZM is given by 
                                               (1) 
where E0 and ωc denote the amplitude and angular frequency of the input optical carrier, 
respectively;  is the applied driving voltage, and  is the optical carrier phase 
difference that is induced by  between the two arms of the MZM. The loss of MZM is 
neglected.  consisting of an electrical sinusoidal signal and a dc biased voltage can be 
written as 
                                                 (2) 
where  is the dc biased voltage,  and  are the amplitude and the angular frequency 
of the electrical driving signal, respectively. The optical carrier phase difference induced by

b. Generation of Mm-Wave Signal Using Balanced MZM 
Fig. 10 shows the MZM with an imbalanced power splitting ratio of the Y-splitter. The electrical 
field at the output of the MZM can be written as: 
   (5) 
where  and  are the power splitting ratios of the first and second Y-splitters in MZM, 
respectively;  and  are the optical carrier phase shifts induced by the applied driving 
voltages in the upper and lower arms of the MZM, respectively. The ER of the imbalanced MZM 
can be expressed as 
                                                         (6) 
Notably, the MZM ER is infinite as  or . If not, the MZM ER will 
have a finite value. Without loss of generality, the assumption that 
, enables Eq. (6) to be rewritten as

key issues that govern the performance of the RoF system is the linearity of E/O conversion 
 20
optical sidebands of the mm-wave signals ( ) employing DSBCS modulation 
scheme unavoidable, as shown in Figs. 8 and 11. These unwanted optical sidebands can degrade 
the performance of the desired electrical mm-wave signals. For mm-wave signal generation using 
balanced MZMs, the amplitudes of the optical sidebands are only proportional to the Bessel 
functions of the corresponding orders. However, for mm-wave signal generations using 
imbalanced MZMs, the amplitudes of optical sidebands are related to not only the Bessel 
functions of the corresponding orders but also the weighting factors consisting of EAM and EPM 
which are defined in publication 1 Appendix II. As modulation index (MI=Vp-p/2Vπ, Vp-p is the 
peak-to-peak voltage of the MZM driving signal) for driving MZM increases from zero to one, 
the zeroth-order Bessel function and the Bessel function of order of more than one will decrease 
and increase, respectively. Fig. 13 plots EAM and EPM as a function of r1, with r2 set at 0.5. As r1 
moves away from the ideal condition, decreasing from 0.5 to zero, as expected, the pure 
amplitude modulation term, EAM, declines and the phase modulation term, EPM, increases. The 
ER of MZM is determined by the combined effect of r1 and r2. Fig. 14 plots the ER versus r1, for 
a commercially available MZM, the typical value of ER is 25 dB, which corresponds to r1=0.44.

d. Generated Electrical Mm-wave signal Analysis 
Fig. 12 (b) presents the generated electrical spectra following square-law PD detection. The 
desired electrical signal originates from the beating between two optical sidebands with a 
frequency difference that is twice the frequency of the electrical driving signal, and the beating of 
the two first-order optical sidebands dominates the power intensity of the desired electrical signal. 
Notably,  and , which originate in MZM imbalance and MI for driving MZM, 
respectively, determine the power intensity of the desired and undesired electrical signal, as 
shown in publication 1 Appendix II. For optical mm-wave signal generation or optical 
up-conversion for RoF links, since the undesired electrical signals can be easily removed by an 
electrical filter, the normalized power intensity of the desired electrical signal ( ) is the key 
parameter as the MZM ER and MI vary.  
Fig. 17 plots the  versus MI and MZM ER after PD detection. The power of the optical 
mm-wave signals before PD detection is normalized to be 0 dBm. As MI increases from zero to 
one, the  increases first and then declines. Notably, the maximum  decreases as the 
MZM ER decreases. Furthermore, the optimal MI for the maximum  (OMI- ) 
increases as the MZM ER falls from 35 dB to 10 dB, as shown in Fig. 18. For a commercial 
MZM with a typical ER of 25 dB, the OMI-  is 0.32±0.2 for a maximum  with a 
tolerance of 1 dB.

B. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
To verify the theories above, DSBCS generation system which was proposed in the part I of this 
project was utilized.  
The performance of RF signals is strongly related to the MZM nonlinearity which can be reduced 
by decreasing the MI. Fig. 20(a) plots the variation of the receiver sensitivities of the 
down-converted signals as a function of MI. The receiver sensitivity initially increases and then 
decreases as MI falls from 1 to 0.13, and the sensitivity is minimal at the optimal MI of 0.43. As 
theoretically demonstrated above, the optimal MI is determined by the trade-off between the 
MZM nonlinearity and the residual optical carrier caused by the imbalance y-junction splitting 
ratio of MZM. 
The MZM nonlinearity and OCSR are determined by MI. As the MI that drives MZM decreases 
from 1 to 0.18, the OCSR decrease from 17 dB to 4.5 dB; meanwhile, the amplitude of the

V. Summury 
In the first part of this project, we experimentally demonstrate a simultaneous generation of BB 
and RF signals based on DCBCS modulation scheme using only one MZM. The optimal MI level 
for driving DD-MZM is 0.43 with 1 dB sensitivity improvement for DC signals, and there is no 
receiver sensitivity penalty after transmitted over 75 km SSMF. Based on the optimal MI of 0.43, 
we can generate DSBCS microwave using only one single-electrode MZM, which is more 
compact and cost-effective. The receiver sensitivity penalty is less than 0.3 dB after transmitted 
over 75 km SSMF. We also confirm that BB signals have better robustness to the impairment of 
fiber nonlinearity than RF signals. 
In the second part of this project, we proposed another architecture for hybrid access network 
using an external integrated modulator. The generated hybrid signals do not suffer from periodic 
performance fading problem caused by fiber dispersion. The receiver sensitivity penalties of both 
RF and BB signals are less than 0.2dB after transmission over 50km SSMF. The results reveal 
that the proposed system has great potential for use in future multi-service access networks. 
The impact of the inherent MZM nonlinear distortion on mm-wave signal generation by DSBCS 
modulation was theoretically and experimentally investigated in the third part of this project. 
Given fabrication tolerances, the effect of MZM imbalance on mm-wave generation was 
theoretically and experimentally studied. Moreover, the optimum conditions for tunable optical 
mm-wave signal generation, optical up-conversion, and optical broadband wireless mm-wave 
signal generation using DSBCS modulation have been also discussed. According to the 
simulation results, only SD-MZM is required to realize DSBCS modulation, which provides a 
compact, cost-effective and better performance alternative.
