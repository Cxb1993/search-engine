1. Introduction 
Nowadays, traditional products with a dull appearance fail to satisfy the vast range of 
consumers’ demands. The image sensation of a product is formed by aggregating the overall 
perceptions of shape, color, and texture, etc. Generally speaking, the shape and color factors 
dominate the visual perception of the product’s image, while the texture of the product’s materials 
dominates the tactile perception. However, when the apparent surfaces of the product are coated or 
plated with the specified colors, the original texture of the material may no longer be perceived 
visually. Compared with shape, colors are changeable through coating or plating. The shape of a 
product is unchangeable after molding. Therefore, developing products with an excellently designed 
shape for different consumer groups has become an essential strategy for many enterprises. 
Generally, a product designer implements his/her conceptual design based on the individual 
experiences, artistic sense and subjective view [1]. If a product’s competitiveness is to be improved, 
the designer not only needs to under the consumer’s psychological needs, but also should learn how 
to fully exploit a database of limited shape images for products. If the designer possessed a 
powerful facility to help the generation of various shape concepts, he or she could quickly display 
the appropriate product shapes on a computer monitor during the conceptual design period. 
Previously, Sun et al. [2] proposed a systematic approach for identifying the most suitable 
design candidate among several design options. Meanwhile, Tovey and Owen [3] presented a 
computer-aided conceptual design method which integrated manual design and the CAD software. 
In their study, the authors asserted that, “conceptual design depends on the rapid production of 
design ideas, usually in the form of sketches, and most CAD techniques are comparatively 
time-consuming”. Notwith- standing these methods, it is still recognized that developing a system 
which can support conceptual design and generate design ideas automatically is a complex task. In 
an attempt to develop such a system, Vico et al. [4] proposed a design method to form a product 
shape by adjusting the position of each vertex of numerous polygonal planes. Consequently, the 
resultant form cannot be used directly by designers in the subsequent design stages because it leads 
to sharp edges between each plane mesh and exhibited no smooth surfaces. However, currently no 
CAD systems exist to satisfy the requirements of conceptual design. [5] 
In this study, a feature-based method [6] is first used to define the shape parameters and to 
construct basic test samples for image evaluation experiments. The fuzzy interpolation method is 
then applied to establish the relationships between the input shape parameters and the output 
adjectival image words. Finally, genetic algorithms (GA) are employed to search for the 
near-optimal design which matches the input image requirements. 
GA has been successfully applied to many optimization problems in previous researches. [7-9]

Fig. 1. The geometric dimension setting for the mineral water bottle form design 
 
In this stage, 500 new bottle forms were randomly generated within the applicable dimension 
ranges. Three well-experienced product designers were invited to cooperate to select 100 bottle 
forms (elementary form samples) exhibiting obvious shape differences. These elementary form 
samples were used for the product image diagnoses when a new evolved form was generated. 
Besides, the image word-pair “feminine-masculine” was selected for the fuzzy linguistic 
investigation of a product’s image. 
The 100 models and the selected word-pair were used as the elementary samples to establish 
the relationships between the bottle forms and their images via questionnaires. The evaluation 
judgment for the image words (feminine / masculine) is quantified between 0~1, where ‘0’ denotes 
an entirely female-like image perception, ‘0.5’ denotes a neutral image perception, and ‘1’ denotes 
an entirely male-like image perception. Forty-two students (nineteen male and twenty-three female) 
following design-related courses were invited to participate in a product-form image investigation. 
Thus, 100 sets of image data presenting forms/image values were acquired. In this study, the image 
value of a randomly generated bottle form can be predicted based on the image data of the existed 
form samples. Through continuous form-similarity calculation with the computer program, the most 
similar form offspring (to the randomly generated form) created from blending two existed samples 
was obtained. Then the image of the randomly generated form can be calculated according to the 
blending weights of the morphed samples. 
By using the population-based search method, newly evolved chromosomes may be regarded

product form. As shown in Fig. 3, the feature parameter tree presents the model’s construction 
history. The cup model is specified by defining 5 shape parameters (cup height fixed as 100 mm) by 
using the path curve and its top and bottom sections in the feature operation of “Loft”. In order to 
enlarge the likelihood of the shape solutions, the geometric parameter ranges for the curve radius 
include the positive domain and the negative domain. In this current definition, the positive radius 
value denotes this curve is convex to the central line. Inversely, the negative value implies a 
concave to the central line. Fig. 4 illustrates their differences.

The image word-pairs considered in this study were selected from the subjects’ responses 
received, where each word-pair comprises a pair of antonyms. Three most appropriate image 
word-pairs are: (1) straight lined – stream lined, (2) heavy – light, and (3) traditional – modern. 
Forty-six graduate students were invited to browse each of the 128 3-D models dynamically on the 
specified standard monitor and to evaluate their image sensations in terms of the three word-pairs 
by assigning an appropriate rating between 0 and 1. 
The fuzzy evaluation model presented in our previous research12 is adopted in the present 
investigation and utilized as the fitness function when searching for an optimal shape to meet a 
required product evaluation using genetic algorithms. The search mechanism proposed in the 
current study begins with a population, each of which is regarded as a chromosome and represents a 
design candidate. The RMSE value between the three evaluated values ( ) and the three target 
values ( ) specified by the designer is calculated. The RMSE value is referred to as “fitness”, and is 
defined as:

where  and  are both within the range between 0 and 1. From this fitness definition, the 
smaller the fitness value, the better the fit of the evolved shape, i.e. the total image of the shape 
converges towards the target image and the evolved shape fits the desired image while the fitness 
(RMSE value) gets smaller. 
ie it
 
3. Design Interface Programming 
With the aid of the CAD software and the Open I-DEAS (VBOI) function, the newly generated 
cup models can present the designer in real time with suggested alternatives. This VBOI function 
permits VB (Visual Basic) developers to quickly create customized applications that can interface 
with the CAD system through external commands. Besides, through the batch-mode operation,

4. Design Case Study 
Two examples for the cup design are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method 
proposed within this paper. The first example presents the predicted image evaluation result based 
upon a given set of shape parameter variables, while the second example shows the generated shape 
based on an input set of desired image targets. 
For the case (a) in Fig. 6, its parameters, i.e. w1, r1, w2, r2 and r3, are set as: (a) 70, 200, 90, 
100, -160, respectively. When all of the parameter settings had been specified, the “GO” button was 
clicked to check the image tendencies of the different word-pairs. By calculating the fuzzy 
evaluation function, the image values are: straight lined – stream lined (0.58), heavy – light (0.73), 
and traditional – modern (0.33). 
The second example represents the inverse operation to that described above. The interface 
shown in Fig. 8 can be used to generate an ideal shape by specifying target image values, i.e. 
straight lined – stream lined (0.7), heavy – light (0.3), and traditional – modern (0.6). The number 
of iterated generations is set to 100. Fig. 8 illustrates the trend for each of the three word-pairs, and 
demonstrates the improvement of the overall fitness over the evolution of the search process. In the 
evolution process, the smaller the fitness value, the more the evolved shape fits the desired image. It 
can be seen that the fitness value decreases with the generation of successive images over the 100 
iterations. Fig. 9 illustrates the best-fitted shapes of the 100th generation.

problems in previous researches.7-9 However, so far as we know, 
very few researchers have ever established applicable methods for 
the user’s sensation-based shape generation using GA. Kim and 
Cho 10 utilized an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) to implement 
fashion design by using binary bits to complete chromosome 
encoding. But, the interactive evaluation method requires 
continuous human’s response and is time-consuming. Liu et al11 
attempted to generate 2D sketches and 3D images of a reading 
lamp by using a tree-based genetic algorithm. Although this 
approach is able to generate some creative solutions (shapes), the 
resultant shapes might not meet the user’s goal image as the 
fitness evaluation mechanism doesn’t include the human’s 
sensation diagnosis. Therefore, this present research implements 
evolutionary genetic searching on shape design with the 
consideration of human’s image sensation. 
 
 
2. RESEARCH METHOD 
This research implements a feature-parameter-based shape 
generation system by considering the case study of a cup design. 
The concept chart of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 1.

2.1. Shape Dimension Setting Shape Dimension Setting 
In a conventional 3-D modeling process, a solid model is created 
by providing numerous sequential feature commands and 
supplying their corresponding parameters.12 The feature operations 
allow the designer to rapidly construct a product form. As shown in 
Fig. 2, the feature parameter tree presents the model’s 
construction history. The cup model is specified by defining 5 
shape parameters (cup height fixed as 100 mm) by using the path 
curve and its top and bottom sections in the feature operation of 
“Loft”. The relative ranges for the geometric parameters, illustrated 
in Fig. 3, are set as: w1 [50, 100], r1 [50, 500] or [-500, -50], w2 [50, 
100], r2 [50, 500] or [-500, -50], and r3 [60, 500]. These 
parameters can be viewed as the real-valued genes of a 
chromosome in the evolutionary process. Table 1 shows how a 
chromosome is completely encoded. The size of search space for 
the real-valued GA is infinite as compared with that for the binary 
GA finite. It denotes the real-valued system searches the ideal 
designs out of an infinite number of design candidates based on 
the required images.

traditional – modern (0.33). The functions of many products surrounding us in our daily lives 
are now mature. For products with similar functions, the style of a 
product becomes an important factor in a consumer’s 
decision-making process when deciding which particular product to 
purchase.1 The consumer’s perception of the product’s style is 
generally induced by a combination of its shape and color. 
Compared with color, the product’s shape is highly changeable and 
not easy to be parameterized. Consequently, it is the intention of 
this paper to construct a consultative design interface for shape 
evaluation and generation by using the feature-parameter 
modeling, the fuzzy interpolation method and genetic algorithms. 
Although the best-fitted shape parameter values have been 
obtained by using Visual Basic, we expect that this developed 
interface can be integrated with the existing CAD systems. Thus, 
the designer can simultaneously preview the evolved shapes and 
the rapid prototype (RP) models can also be produced. A cup 
design is chosen as the subject of the current investigation. 
However, the proposed method is equally applicable to the design 
of other products. 
The second example represents the inverse operation to that 
described above. The interface shown in Fig. 5 can be used to 
generate an ideal shape by specifying target image values, i.e. 
straight lined – stream lined (0.7), heavy – light (0.3), and 
traditional – modern (0.6). The number of iterated generations is 
set to 100. Fig. 6 illustrates the trend for each of the three 
word-pairs, and demonstrates the improvement of the overall 
fitness over the evolution of the search process. In the evolution 
process, the smaller the fitness value, the more the evolved shape 
fits the desired image. It can be seen that the fitness value 
decreases with the generation of successive images over the 100 
iterations. Fig. 7 illustrates the best-fitted shapes of the 100th 
generation.

Abstract—Color of food, even the color design of its outer 
package, would affect not only our appetites but the flavor sense 
[1]. To facilitate flavor-image based color design, this research 
aims at the synesthesia relationship from colors to flavors. 
Generally, a designer carries out the color-planning activities 
based upon his/her individual experience, but this is not objective 
enough and very inefficient. If the designer possessed the facility 
to access a powerful tool to evaluate the image of the designed 
color schemes, he or she could quickly display the appropriate 
color schemes during the conceptual design period. Through the 
quantitative methods of triangular fuzzy numbers, fuzzy total 
utility values and fuzzy utility similarity, the subject’s qualitative 
judgment on color-to-flavor image can be quantified and then 
served as the knowledge database of the proposed color-design 
evaluation model. The image experiments on single colors, two-
color combinations, and three-color combinations are performed 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, 
a color-combination design for a food package is presented based 
on the consistence between color-to-flavor synesthesia of the 
designed colors and the flavor of the food.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Eighty percentage of our daily received information is 
conveyed by the visual system [2]. To our visual sensation, the 
overall image perception of an object’s style is generally 
induced by its form and by its color. Tsai et al. [3] investigated 
the overall image of a product, and the results showed that the 
overall image perception was dominated by the product’s color 
rather than by its form. 
Many color design researchers keep their attentions on the 
synesthesia induced by color stimuli. The sense of color-to-
flavor in synesthesia is of better consensus and practical utility. 
Nowadays, the hardware and software of computers has 
reached mature development. Computer-aided color simulation 
has become the dominant method for color design and the 
parameterized color systems are adopted for color presentation 
[4]. Thus, it is appropriate to quantify the relationship between 
color and its synesthesia for the studies on synesthesia of color-
flavor. 
Most CAD product development systems only addressed 
the physical aspects of product design. However, an equally 
important element of the design process is the consideration of 
the psychological aspects of a product, including the emotional 
and aesthetic responses of an individual to the proposed 
product design. So far as we know, very few computer-aided 
design systems support the product color-planning activities, 
although many tasks performed by an industrial designer 
involve the consideration of the potential user’s perception of 
the product color. 
Traditional color image-related researches were usually 
limited in the discussion issues of single conceptual image or 
color preference suggestion. They didn’t include the 
construction of the objective quantitative relationship between 
color and its image. Therefore, this research focused on 
computer-aided color design with the chromaesthesia of color-
to-flavor. It constructed the quantitative relationship between 
colors and its associated image evaluation of flavor. The 
method integrated with fuzzy numbers, fuzzy total utility 
values and fuzzy utility similarity [5,6] were utilized to build a 
color-combination evaluation model based on the flavor image 
perception. Two case studies of color designs for food gift 
packages were individually evaluated through the proposed 
method. 
II. IMPLEMENTATION METHODS  
Five familiar flavor-based adjectives, i.e. acid, sweet, bitter, 
spicy, and salty, to Taiwanese were selected to investigate 
subjects’ color-to-flavor synesthesia image. Additionally, 216 
basic color samples specified with RGB parameters were 
created in Fig. 1. Fifty-three design-related students (20 males 
and 33 females) were invited to observe these color samples 
and gave their judgements using the seven-tier linguistic 
variables. 
The seven linguistic variables (VL: very low, L: low, ML: 
medium low, M: medium, MH: medium high, H: high, VH: 
very high) [7] were used for the subjects to indicate the color 
perception degrees on flavor-image. These variables can be 
viewed as fuzzy linguistic sets and quantified using triangular 
fuzzy numbers. The implementation procedures and the related 
mathematical algorithms used in this study include the 
following steps.

I. Best Linguistic Variable Selection 
Select the corresponding best linguistic data of each flavor 
adjectives for the color design with largest utility similarity. 
Thus, the designer could know the flavor image corresponded 
to the linguistic variable form. 
J. Evaluation Model Reliability Demonstration 
To check the reliability of the proposed evaluation model, 
the RMSE values between the evaluated results and the experi-

data. 
mental data were obtained, shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the 
RMSE for 100 random color designs (50 single colors, 25 two-
color combinations and 25 three-color combination) is within 
the acceptable range, less than 0.1. 
III. COLOR DESIGN CASE STUDIES 
Two color design cases of flavor image evaluation were 
implemented in this research. One example is a pickle gift 
package with two-color design, and the other is a durian gift 
package with three-color design. 
A. Two-Color Pickle Gift Package Design 
A two-color pickle gift package was taken in the current 
study as the color-design example of the flavor-related 
merchandise. Two colors of the green/pink tone with their 
RGB parameters, C1(177, 216, 86) and C2(219, 81, 109), were 
specified for this design (shown as Fig. 3). Designer A 
intended this design felt acid, sweet and a little spicy for the 
accordance with the real pickle inside. The color area ratio of 
C1 and C2 is 0.4 versus 0.6. Through the proposed image 
evaluation model, the flavor-image similarity result was 
calculated in Table 1. It shows that the acid and sweet images 
is nearest to medium degrees (the corresponding intensities 
0.90 and 0.87), and the spicy image is nearest to medium low 
degree (intensity 0.86). Therefore, the designer might further 
check whether the evaluation meets his/her image goal and 
modify the color setting.
