1. Introduction 
 
Electromagnetic-wave propagation phenomena in a general bi-isotropic medium are 
flourishing owing to two additional parameters in its constitutive relations, namely the 
chirality and Tellegen parameters. Typically, a general bi-isotropic medium can be further 
categorized into two subclasses, i.e., a non-reciprocally Tellegen medium (with a non-zero 
Tellegen parameter and a zero chrality parameter) and a reciprocally chiral medium (with a 
non-zero chrality parameter and a zero Tellegen parameter). The particular propagation 
phenomena pertaining to the chiral medium contain the optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and 
the circular dichroism (CD), while the one corresponding to the Tellegen medium is the 
nonorthogonality of electric and magnetic field vectors [1]. The ORD indicates the 
polarization rotation of a linearly polarized wave, and the CD denotes the difference between 
the absorption coefficients of the two circularly polarized eigenwaves of this wave. A general 
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) formulation [2] has been developed for modeling the 
general bi-isotropic media. The numerical results have been obtained to make all the wave 
propagation phenomena conceptually visible in the time domain.  
 
Electrically conductive graphite fibers have frequently been embedded in electrically 
resistive polymeric resins to form graphite-fiber-reinforced-plastic composite (GFRPC). 
GFRPC has been widely applied as a replacement for metals because of its superior 
mechanical properties and lower weight-to-volume ratio [3], [4]. From the electromagnetic 
point of view, the GFRPC may be treated as a multilayered anisotropic medium. The 
electromagnetic properties of GFRPC are very similar to those of metals except that they are 
anisotropic [5]-[8]. The numerical results have demonstrated the obvious influence of the 
 12
model, the numerical results of the reflection from either a Tellegen slab or a chiral slab 
backed by a GFRPC are obtained in the frequency domain. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
convolution is then employed to compute the transient reflection results. The numerical 
results should be viewed in both the time domain and the frequency domain for a thorough 
investigation into the reflection properties. Some special reflection properties may be 
observed in the two domains with the various material parameters of the bi-isotropic slab and 
the different fiber-orientation patterns of the GFRPC. As a distinctive discovery, an incident 
EMP may be almost completely absorbed or reflected, being totally cross-polarized in some 
cases. Therefore, the proposed combination of the bi-isotropic medium and the GFRPC may 
be of significant value for generating a new transient absorber technology. On the other hand, 
the GFRPC material has been widely applied in the construction of modern aircraft and ships. 
The bi-isotropic media may be considered as the coating for reducing their RCS in a broad 
band.  
 
 
                                                                                                          
2. Constitutive Relations 
 
Consider a plane wave normally impinging upon a multilayered slab, as Fig. 1 shows. 
More specifically, the slab can be a bi-isotropic slab backed by a laminated GFRPC of N 
layers. For the electrically anisotropic GFRPC, the constitutive relations are 
 
= ε ⋅D E , (1) 
 
0= µB H . (2)

=B cµ +H Eς  
c≡ µ +H 0 0( j )χ + κ µ ε E  
0crµµ≡ +H ccrr )j( εµκ+χ E . (6) 
 
In (5) and (6), 0ε  and 0µ  are the free-space permittivity and permeability, cε  and 
cµ  are the permittivity and permeability, and κ  and χ  are the chirality parameter and the 
Tellegen parameter. In addition, cr cr r, ,ε µ κ  and rχ  are the relative permittivity, the relative 
permeability, the relative chirality parameter and the relative Tellegen parameter, respectively. 
The relative chirality parameter rκ  and the relative Tellegen parameter rχ  specially 
defined in such a manner are for the convenience of the following discussion of results.  
 
The chirality parameter κ  is usually frequency dependent. It is assumed to follow the 
Condon model [1], [2] and is expressed as

0 0j2
τω ωκ = ω −ω + Γω ω ,    (7) 
 
in which τ  is a time constant, 0ω  is a characteristic resonant frequency, and Γ  is a 
damping factor. As Γ  is not zero, κ  is a complex value that indicates that the 
corresponding chiral medium is lossy. Under the physical constraint of a lossy dispersive 
chiral medium [1], the permittivity cε  and the permeability cµ  should not be real and may 
be dispersive as well. An oscillator model of cε  and cµ  [17], [2], demonstrated by 
measurements, is employed and expressed as

For the cylindrical structure as shown in Fig. 2, substitute the constitutive relations (1) 
and (2) in the cylindrical coordinates, as well as (5) and (6) into the time-harmonic Maxwell 
equations (10) and (11). The operator ∇  and the electromagnetic fields in (10) and (11) are 
then decomposed into the radial (ρ ) and tangential (φ  and z) components. By eliminating 
the ρ -directed fields and using the fact that the tangential fields can be expanded as

State-equation (12) and (16) can be further converted into a matrix equation by using a 
finite-difference algorithm. Here, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method [18], [19] may 
be considered as the finite-difference algorithm owing to its having the best compromise 
among computational simplicity, efficiency and accuracy. The RK4 method can be stabilized 
by using a sufficiently small step, namely ∆ . This method introduces a numerical error on 
the order of 5∆ . In addition, the step ∆  should be electrically very small when compared to 
the wavelength of the electromagnetic fields. As the matrix equation is obtained, the reflected 
or scattered fields can be determined by applying the boundary conditions on the front and 
back surfaces of the multilayered structures. Then, the transient reflected waves may be 
computed by using the FFT convolution of the incident EMP and the solved impulse 
reflection response of the considered structures.

In Fig. 4, the zero-reflection frequency is 91018.3 ×  Hz which is in agreement with the value 
calculated by (20).   
  
Co- and cross-polarized reflection from a GFRPC slab coated with a Tellegen medium 
is shown in Fig 5. The fiber-orientation pattern of the GFRPC is [1(0)/1(90)] and the total 
layer number N is 4. For the Tellegen coating, the relative non-reciprocity rχ  and relative 
impedance crη  are chosen to be the same and equal to 0.5. Thickness cd  of this coating is 
10 mm. The impinging plane wave is polarized in TM to x-direction. The twist-polarizer 
effect is shown, i.e., the co-polarized low-reflection bands always correspond to the 
cross-polarized high-reflection bands. 
 
The condition of the occurrence of twist-polarizer effect is examined in Fig. 6, where 
the co-polarized reflection from a Tellegen-medium coated GFRPC slab with various 
non-reciprocities is shown. On the basis of the results, it is proposed that making the values of 
the relative impedance and the relative non-reciprocity of the Tellegen coating close to each 
other is an optimal condition for achieving the twist-polarizer effect. 
 
The bandwidth and the central frequency of the twist-polarizer bands can be tuned by 
varying the material parameters and the thickness of the Tellegen coating. Shown in Fig. 7 is 
the co-polarized reflection from a Tellegen-medium coated GFRPC slab with the same value 
of rχ  and crη  as a parameter. In this figure, the results show that the larger rχ  is or the 
closer it is to its extreme value 1, the wider and deeper the twist-polarizer bands are. In 
addition, Fig. 8 shows the co-polarized reflection from a Tellegen-medium coated GFRPC 
slab with the coating thickness as a parameter. The results suggest that the thinner the 
thickness is, the higher and wider the twist-polarizer bands are.  
 
 22
The results stated above suggest that the major factors influencing the transient 
reflection properties may be the non-zero Tellegen parameter and the preferred 
fiber-orientation pattern. Hence, a Tellegen slab backed by a GFRPC with a preferred 
fiber-orientation pattern is considered here for making some special properties occur. As 
shown in Fig.16, the cross-polarized reflection for the considered case is more evident and 
wider band in comparison with the reflection in the other two cases of a [1(45)] GFRPC and a 
Tellegen slab backed by a [1(0)/1(45)/1(90)/1(-45)] GFRPC. In Fig. 17, the transient results 
indeed show that the Tellegen slab backed by a [1(45)] and a [1(-45)] GFRPC may evidently 
lower the co-polarized reflection or make the reflection almost completely cross-polarized. 
However, the major twist-reflector effect occurs at the late time and the very early time. The 
end-on view of the [1(-45)] case is also shown in Fig. 18. Even better performance may be 
expected if the material parameters, the slab thickness, and the fiber-orientation pattern are 
optimized.    
 
 
 
5. Results and Discussion for Cylindrical Structures 
 
To check the validity of the procedure developed in this paper, bistatic echo widths of a 
single-layer GFRPC cylindrical shell covered by a two-layer chiral medium with ⊥σ  of the 
GFRPC used as a parameter are first computed at the frequency of 300 MHz. The structural 
parameters of the GFRPC are: 127.0=fd mm, °= 450θ , 40000// =σ  S/m, and 5=rε . 
With subscripts 1 and 2, respectively, used to denote the inner layer and the outer layer of the 
two-layer chiral coating, the structural parameters of the chiral medium are: 
m,25.0=+ fi dρ m,5.021 == cc dd ),00101(4.2517851 .jcr −×=ε 2.212889,2 =crε
)001.01(21 jcr −×=µ , 5.12 =crµ , 5425993.01 =rκ , 310167602 .r −=κ , and 021 == rr χχ . 
 24
Fig. 21 shows the co-polarized monostatic echo widths with crη  used as a parameter. It 
is seen that under the so-called twist-polarizer condition ( rcr χη ≤ ) originally proposed for a 
PEC-backed planar chiral slab [1], the invisible bands occur. When this condition is violated 
( rcr χη > ), the invisible frequency bands become higher, and the echo widths are no longer 
reduced to zero. Moreover, there appears a dual-dip phenomenon (i.e., there is a bulge 
centered in the invisible band of the echo-width curve) at crη  less than rχ , as indicated in 
Fig. 22. This dual-dip phenomenon for the larger rχ  is more evident than that for the 
smaller rχ . In addition, the dual-dip becomes a single-dip as rχ  is equal to crη . Note that 
the dual-dip phenomenon also exists for the PEC-backed chiral slab (cf. Figs. 3.18 and 3.19 in 
[1]). 
 
On the basis of equal rχ  and crη , the monostatic echo widths for various values of  
these parameters are shown in Fig. 23. The larger the parameters of rχ  and crη , the higher 
the invisible frequency bands and the wider their bandwidths are. Shown in Fig. 24 are the 
echo widths for three different cylinder radii. Note that in this figure the abscissas are the 
free-space wavenumbers (k) instead of the normalized frequencies (ka). The results show that 
the location of the invisible frequency band is not sensitive to the cylinder radius. 
 
Fig. 25 shows the co-polarized and cross-polarized echo widths for two different sets of 
values of rχ  and crη . Since rχ  is close to crη  in both cases, the almost zero co-polarized 
echo widths in the invisible bands are obtained. It is clear that the invisible bands of the 
co-polarized echo widths coincide with the visible bands of the cross-polarized echo widths. 
Instead of being absorbed by the chiral coating in the invisible bands, the invisibility is 
achieved by twisting the polarization, i.e., the linearly polarized incident wave is 
backscattered almost totally cross-polarized by the chiral medium.

oo 360270 << φ ). 
 
Fig. 29 shows the TM co-polarized bistatic echo widths at 2.5=k  for various chirality 
parameters, i.e., =rκ 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9. Although the invisible characteristic (observed at 
)0=φ  may be slightly affected by the presence of the chirality, the levels of the 
backscattering echo widths are still relatively small as compared with that for the case of 
0=rκ . Here, omitted is the figure for the TE case that shows similar results. 
 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The state-equation models for governing electromagnetic fields in multilayered 
bi-isotropic and anisotropic slabs and cylinders were presented. On the basis of solving these 
models, numerical results for reflection and scattering from GFRPC slabs and cylinders 
coated with bi-isotropic media were obtained. The twist-polarizer effect pertaining to these 
structures was investigated in detail. The effect depends not only on the material parameters 
and thickness of the coating but also on the GFRPC material parameters and structure. The 
optimal twist-polarizer condition is to make the relative impedance close to the relative 
non-reciprocity in the Tellegen cases. In addition, the anisotropy and the inhomogeneity of 
the GFRPC’s were essential for making the twist-polarizer effect occur in the chiral cases. 
However, the optimal twist-polarizer condition for the chiral cases cannot be predicted 
analytically. For GFRPC objects, being coated with bi-isotropic media may be a good way to 
reduce their RCS in a broad band. In addition, the RCS may be highly reduced in a wide 
incidence angle.
