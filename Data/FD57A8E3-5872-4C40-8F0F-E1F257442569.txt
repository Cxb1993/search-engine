p∈y \  is the measurable output of the system. For system 
(1), the system matrices have appropriate dimensions. 
Without loss generality, we assume that ( )rank l=F  and 
( )rank k=G . Suppose that the sampling interval is T and a 
zero-order-hold is adopted for the above-mentioned 
continuous-time model. Denoting ( ) ( )k kT=x x , 
( ) ( )k kT=y y , and ( ) ( )k kT=u u  where 0k ≥  is an integer, 
the discrete-time model for (1) can be then given by

where the magnitudes of ( )kf  is on the order of ( )O T . The 
magnitude of g is said to be ( )nO T=g  if 
 10 0lim 0   and   lim 0n nT TT T −→ →
≠ =g g  (5) 
where n is an integer and we denote ( ) ( )0 1O T O= . It follows 
from (3) that ( )O T=B . Although system (2) has the sensor 
noise and unknown input, a state and unknown input 
estimation algorithm is proposed in this paper. When the 
sampling period is fast and the disturbance is bounded and 
smooth, the proposed design method can constrain the 
estimation error to be on the order of ( )O T . Before 
introducing the main results, the following four assumptions 
are made throughout this project. 
Assumption 1: System (2) is observable.  
Assumption 2: These matrices A , G  and C  can satisfy 
 nrank n k+
⎛ ⎞⎡ ⎤− = +⎜ ⎟⎢ ⎥⎜ ⎟−⎣ ⎦⎝ ⎠
A I G
C FF C 0
  
Since ( )rank l=F , it follows from Assumption 2 that 
p k l≥ + .  
Assumption 3: The system (with respect to the relation 
between the output and the sensor noise) is minimum phase. It 
follows that

Assumption 4 [14-16]: The sampling interval T is sufficiently 
small such that the disturbance does not vary too much 
between two consecutive sampling instances.  
III. STATE ESTIMATION 
Since ( )rank l=F , it follows that the pseudo inverse 
( ) 1T T l p−+ ×= ∈F F F F \  of the matrix F  should be found 
such that l
+ =F F I . It follows from (2) that 
( ) ( ) ( )k k k+ += −n F y F Cx . Augment a vector z as

Hence, we can conclude the pair ( ),w wA C  is detectable and

The proof of ( )2( 1) ( )k k O T+ − =f f  should be found in 
Adridi’s paper [14]. Hence, we complete this lemma.

where ( )22( )k O Tγ= =p . Since the pair ( ),w wA C  is 
detectable, the conventional pole assignment method can be 
used to decide the gain matrix L. Another alternative method 
is given by 
 ( ) 1T Tw w w w w w w −= +L A P C R C P C  (18) 
where ( ) ( ) 0n l k n l kw + + × + +∈ >P \  is obtained from the following 
discrete algebraic Riccati equation 
( ) 1T T T Tw w w w w w w w w w w w w w w−+ + − =P A P C C P C R C P A A P A Q  (19) 
where ( ) ( ) 0n l k n l kw + + × + +∈ >Q \  and 0p pw ×∈ >R \ . The 
performance of the proposed estimator satisfies the property 
of Theorem 1. 
Theorem 1: Consider the dynamic system (1) with its 
corresponding discrete-time model (2) and design the state 
and disturbance observers as (9). If a gain matrix L is 
designed to be stabilized the matrix w w−A LC , then the 
estimation performance satisfies the following properties: 
 ( )2lim ( )k k O T→∞ ≤x  and ( )2lim ( )k k O T→∞ ≤e  
Proof: We know that the matrix w w−A LC  can be 
decomposed as 1w w
−− =A LC MJM  where J is the Jordan 
matrix of the eigenvalues of w w−A LC  and M is the 
corresponding eigenvector matrix. Then the solution of (17) is

Since ( )2 22 2 2lim ( ) lim ( ) ( )k kk k k O T→∞ →∞= + ≤w z e , it follows 
that ( )2lim ( )k k O T→∞ ≤z  and ( )2lim ( )k k O T→∞ ≤e . The proof of 
this theorem is complete.   
Remark 1: As can be seen from the above-mentioned 
analysis, if the unknown input is smooth enough, the proposed 
observer method can be used to accurately perform the 
operation with well estimation. This assumption, which 
indicates the insignificant variation of the unknown input 
between the two sampling points, points out the fact that the 
unknown input bandwidth is far smaller than the observer 
bandwidth. In comparison with other methods [6-9], the 
algorithm we propose is capable of not only dealing with an 
unsatisfied matching condition system but also being 
implemented in specific nonminimum phase systems.
