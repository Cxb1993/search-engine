Abstract 
Presented here is the determination of equilibrium phase boundaries of two pure fluids, water and 
carbon dioxide, via the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model. The 2PT method estimates the 
thermodynamic properties (i.e., energy, entropy, and free energy) with quantum corrections of a 
system from its vibrational density of state (DOS), which can be determined from the Fourier 
transform of the velocity autocorrelation function. It is found that 2PT can provide converged 
properties from a short (about 20-ps) trajectory of molecular motions, regardless of the state of 
aggregation of the system. In the present work, we validate its accuracy by examining the predicted 
phase boundaries and the property changes associated with phase transitions based on 2PT properties. 
The predicted vapor-liquid and solid-liquid coexisting lines are found to be comparable to those 
determined from other simulation techniques. Our results indicate that the 2PT properties are 
accurate enough for phase equilibrium calculations, while the required computational cost is 
significantly less than other more rigorous methods. 
 
Keywords: Phase Boundary, 2PT, free energy, absolute entropy, quantum correction

I. Introduction 
The knowledge of thermodynamic properties of a system at different states in the phase space is 
critical for understanding the equilibrium condition of the system.1 For example, under constant 
temperature and pressure, a system spontaneously evolves in the direction towards the state of lowest 
Gibbs free energy (equilibrium). Furthermore, the condition where two or more phases coexist can 
also be determined from the equivalence of molar Gibbs free energy of each chemical species in each 
of the coexisting phases.  
 Many computational or theoretical methods have been developed for the calculation of free 
energy or its changes between two states. Examples include the thermodynamic integration (TI),2-7 
free energy perturbation (FEP),8, 9 the potential of mean force (PMF),10-12 particle insertion method,13, 
14 and other approximation methods.15-21 The essence of these methods is to estimate the change in 
free energy between two states through a path without a phase transition. If the absolute entropy/free 
energy of one state (Einstein crystal,2 hard-sphere fluids,7 pure solvent,3 or ideal gas state4) is known, 
the absolute entropy/free energy at the other state can be determined.  
 Despite their wide applications and high accuracy, these methods are often computationally 
intensive, and the number of samplings (for Monte-Carlo simulations) or the length of trajectory 
(from molecular dynamic simulations) is enormous to ensure a converged property. As a 
consequence, many approximation methods have been proposed aiming at a more efficient 
estimation of the free energy and absolute entropy without much sacrificing in accuracy. Most of 
these methods correlate the properties to structural (radial distribution function15, 18, 19) or dynamic 
properties (diffusivity,7 or force and torque exerted on the molecules17) of the fluids or solids. 
However, many of these approximation methods are valid for restricted systems and/or conditions.  
 Recently, the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) method was proposed for fast determination of 
thermodynamic properties of fluids from short (~20 ps) trajectory of MD simulations. 
(Lennard-Jones fluid,22 water,23 CO2,24 organic solvents25 and water-macromolecule solutions.26-30) 
Nevertheless, the use of 2PT for the determination of phase boundary has not been demonstrated. 
This is a more challenging task since the equilibrium conditions depend exponentially on energetic 
properties (one example is the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for vapor pressure31). The purpose of the 
present work is to examine the reliability of determination of phase coexisting conditions from the 
2PT method through equality of Gibbs free energies. The vapor-liquid and solid-liquid coexisting 
conditions of water (a highly polar system) and carbon dioxide (a nonpolar system) are used for 
validation. Our results show that the 2PT method is accurate enough for the determination various 
types of phase coexisting conditions.

Equation 7 ensures that all the diffusive modes of a system (S(0)) are included in the gas-like 
component. The fluidicity f indicates the fraction of gas-like degrees of freedom (Note that  
Sgm()d=3Mfm). For intra-molecular vibration, the gas-like component is zero due to its harmonic 
nature; i.e., Ssimv() = Simv().  
The property components are determined from the weighed integral of the velocity based on the

For water, we carried out 0.6-ns MD simulations in NPT ensemble with the integration time 
step set to 1 fs. The SHAKE algorithm43 was used to keep the OH bond length and HOH bond angle 
constant. To avoid significant fluctuation in the cell volume at the beginning of the MD simulations, 
a short NVT run (100 ps) was performed for vapor phase before the NPT dynamic equilibrium 
simulation. For CO2, a long (> 4 ns) NPT simulation with velocity rescaling24 was performed to 
facilitate thermal equilibration. After the system was equilibrated, additional 20-ps samplings with 
the trajectory saved at every 4 fs were used for the 2PT property analysis.  
 
Determination of phase boundaries via equality of Gibbs free energies 
 The phase boundaries can be determined by the equality of molar free energies (G) in different 
phases.  
GI(T, P) = GII (T, P)           (21) 
At a given pressure, we performed NPT MD runs over a certain range of temperature (with a 4 K 
interval) in different phases (with different densities). A linear function was employed to fit the 
simulation data (Gibbs free energies, densities, and entropies) and to determine the two-phase 
coexisting temperature, which is identified by the point of intersection in the Gibbs free energies. 
Extrapolation was used only if the point of intersection cannot be determined by interpolation of 
curves. The uncertainty in the coexisting temperature is determined at a confidence interval of 68.3%. 
The saturated densities and entropies are calculated from the fitting functions at the coexisting 
condition (T and P).  
 
Determination of phase boundaries via two-phase MD simulations 
As a test for consistency, we also determined the phase boundaries using a two-phase model. In 
these simulations, the initial molecular model contains a solid and a liquid (or a liquid and a vapor) 
slab. Constant NPT or NVT simulations were performed at a series of temperatures and the 
two-phase coexisting temperature is identified as the one whose energy and thickness of each phase 
does not change with time. 
 
IV. Results and Discussion

function of temperature at three pressures (1, 20, and 100 atm). The Gibbs free energies of condensed 
phases are insensible to pressure changes; therefore, the point of intersections of G of solid and 
liquid phases (inset of Figure 1) are nearly the same at the three pressures, leading to constant 
melting temperature (around 323 K). On the other hand, the Gibbs free energy of the vapor phase 
changes significantly with pressure; therefore, a noticeable increase of boiling temperature (point of 
intersection of G for the liquid and vapor phases) with increasing pressure is observed. It should be 
noted that at higher pressure the metastable region (degree of superheating) becomes smaller and the

and reported data in literature using Monte-Carlo simulations,47, 49, 50 MD simulations,48 MD 
simulation plus free energy calculation,46, 51 and the cell theory45 for TIP4P-Ew water. As shown in 
Figure 1, the results from our two-phase simulations (open circles in brown) are in agreement with 
the MC simulation results by Vega et al.47 (open triangles) and Baranyai et al.49 (open diamonds). On 
the other hand, the 2PT calculation results for vapor-liquid equilibrium are close to the work of Horn 
et al.51 (open squares) which best reproduces the experimental results (solid line). Although the cell 
theory (cross) shows similar result in normal boiling point, the melting point cannot be determined 
from the same method.45 The melting point from both MC and MD simulations are underestimated, 
while the result is overestimated by the 2PT method. The difference between the simulation data and 
2PT calculation may result from the inclusion of quantum effect in 2PT. The stronger quantum 
effects in the solid phase leads to a higher value in the entropy and lower value in the Gibbs free 
energy. Therefore, the point of interception in the G-T diagram (see Figure 1) is moved to higher 
temperature values.

compared with the experimental data (solid line)44 and other simulation results and free energy 
calculations.46, 47, 49, 50 The dashed lines are boundaries between VLE and SLE for experiments, 
2PT method, and MC simulation by Vega et al.47, 50 
  
Figure 2 illustrates the temperature(T)-density(d) phase diagram. For vapor-liquid equilibrium, 
the densities of the coexisting phases are found to be similar regardless of the method used, except 
for the vapor density from the 2PT method at highest T (P = 100 atm). The possible reason is that the 
vapor saturated density is very sensitive to temperature near the critical point and a small difference 
in the coexisting temperature (see Figure 1) could lead to a significant difference in the vapor phase 
density. For solid-liquid equilibrium, we can find MC and MD simulations underestimate the melting 
temperature between SLE and VLE, while the 2PT result is overestimated. Nonetheless, the density 
of both the solid and the liquid phases are in agreement with the experiment.

Carbon dioxide 
 Figure 5 shows the P-T phase diagram of CO2. The 2PT result and two-phase simulation data 
are compared to the experimental data44 and MC simulations by Harris and Yung.36 The vapor-liquid 
coexistence from our two-phase MD simulations differ from that determined by Harris and Yung. 
However, the reason for such discrepancies is not known. Interestingly, the 2PT results are in better 
agreement with both the experimental and MC data. In SLE, the melting point determined from MD 
simulation is too low (176 K). In contrast, the 2PT result is in agreement with the experimental data 
(216.6 K). The triple point determined from the 2PT calculation is 10 atm and 216 K, compared to 
the experimental observation 5.18 atm and 216.6 K.

Table 2 summarizes the phase change data on the predicted phase boundaries. The 2PT result is 
compared to the experimental44, 53 data. The properties determined from 2PT are found to be in good 
agreement with those from experiment. Figure 7 illustrates the P-H relation of CO2. Maximum 
deviation in enthalpy is about 1 kJ/mol, which occurs at P = 40 atm. 
 
V. Conclusion 
 In this paper the equilibrium phase boundaries of water and CO2 via the 2PT method are 
presented. The predicted results are comparable to both the simulation and experimental data.

學術外，也深入了解大陸學生不管在文化上及生活上與台灣學生的不同，都是此行
難得可貴的經驗。另外就是在研討會的後面幾天，去參訪許多以前在歷史課本上所
看到的歷史古蹟名勝，更令我確切的感受到北京的歷史與人文藝術，也拓展了我的
國際視野，此皆為蠻可貴的經驗，以上是我參加會議的心得。
