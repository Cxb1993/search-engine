Overall Abstract
This project integrates three sub-projects dedicating to the systematic investigations of the
hierarchically assembled supramolecular block copolymers. The project has dealt with the
supramolecular comb-coil block and supramolecular hairy rod-coil diblock copolymer systems
formed by the complexation of coil-coil and rod-coil diblock copolymers with low molecular
weight amphiphiles, respectively. The aspects having been investigated encompass the syntheses
of the starting block copolymers and low molecular weight amphiphiles (Sub-project 1 and 2),
preparation of the supramolecular block copolymers (Sub-project 1, 2 and 3), characterizations of
the hierarchical structures and phase transition behavior (Sub-project 3) and evaluation of the
optical and electrical properties (Sub-project 1 and 2). For the supramolecular comb-coil blocks, the
effects of molecular architecture of the starting block copolymer (linear vs. hetero-arm star vs.
block-arm star), copolymer composition and molecular weight, complex composition, strength of
secondary bonding (ionic vs. hydrogen) and the length of the alky tails of the low-molecular weight
amphiphiles have been systematically investigated. We have also explored the novel hierarchical
structures offered by the supramolecules. In the case of the supramoleuclar hairy rod-coil diblock
copolymer, the rod block is mainly formed by the conjugated polymer backbone such as
polyaniline, polythiophene and polyfluorene. The effect of copolymer composition on the
self-assembled structures has been revealed. The correlation between the self-assembly behavior
and photophysical properties has also been studied.

I. Tetragonally Packed Cylinder Structure via Hierarchical Assembly of Comb-Coil Diblock
Copolymer
Abstract
Block copolymers constitute an important class of soft material capable of self-assembling into
nanoscale microdomains with well-defined geometries. The cylindrical domains thus formed have
been found to pack almost exclusively in hexagonal lattice. In this study, we disclose how the
mesomorphic molecular order can mediate the packing symmetry to generate an anomalous
tetragonal lattice in a diblock copolymer composing of a coil and a supramolecular comb block.
This system displays a hierarchical structure in which the larger-scale cylinders formed by the coil
blocks are embedded in a liquid crystalline matrix composing of a smaller-scale lamellar structure
organized by the comb blocks. The cylinders are found to pack in either the typical hexagonal
lattice or the tetragonal lattice governed by the orientation of the lamellae with respect to the
cylinder prescribed by the overall grafting density of the comb blocks.
Introduction
Self-assembly of soft matter is one of the most effective approaches for constructing
nanostructures with controllable order. Many of these structures are mesomorphic, characterized by
certain degrees of orientational or positional order at one or multiple length scales coupled with the
dynamic spectrum over a broad range of time scale1. Soft matter has been considered as a key
element for producing the newest generation of smart and functional materials; therefore, the
development of the fundamental basis for engineering its self-assembly behavior is an essential step
toward nanoscale regulation of structure and functioning.
Block copolymers composing of two or more covalently connected chains per molecule
constitute an important class of soft material capable of self-assembling into a rich variety of
nanostructures2,3. Two levels of structural organization can be recognized for block copolymer
self-assembly in the melt state. The first level is the microphase separation between the repulsive
dissimilar blocks, which generates micelle composing of the microdomain (core) and the corona
formed by the respective blocks. The geometry of the microdomain thus formed includes lamellae,
cylinder and sphere depending on the interfacial tension at domain interface and the conformational
entropy of the block chains3,4. The second level involves the spatial organization of the micelles,

cylindrical domains are embedded in the matrix composing of P4VP(DBSA) lamellar mesophase.
We will show that the PS cylinders arrange in the typical hexagonal lattice or an anomalous
tetragonal lattice depending on the overall binding fraction. The present system is uniquely
different from PS-b-PChEMA13 in terms of the tunable packing symmetry and the special molecular
architecture constructed by a simple supramolecular approach.
Experimental Section
Materials. Two symmetric PS-b-P4VPs denoted as PS12K-b-P4VP12K and PS50K-b-P4VP50K
synthesized by sequential anionic polymerizations of styrene and 4-vinyl pyridine were acquired
from Polymer Source, Inc. The number average molecular weights of PS and P4VP blocks in the
former are 12000 and 11800, respectively, whereas those in the later are 50,000 and 49,800,
respectively. The polydispersity indices of both samples are 1.05. The surfactant DBSA (soft
type) was obtained from Tokio Kasei, Tokyo, Japan. This material had the purity of 90 %, and the
remaining impurity consisted of different chain lengths and branches:
(CnH2n+1)(CmH2m+1)CHPhSO3H, with n+m+1=10,…14. It was dried in vacuo at 60oC for 12 h
before use.
Preparation of Comb-Coil Diblock Copolymers. PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) comb-coil copolymers were
prepared by dissolving preweighed PS-b-P4VP and DBSA in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)
followed by evaporating most solvent at ca. 60 oC. The samples were finally dried in vacuo at 100
oC for 12 hrs to remove the residual solvent. The overall binding fraction of DBSA to P4VP block
is denoted by x, which expresses the average number of DBSA molecules bound with a 4VP
monomer unit prescribed by the feed ratio of DBSA and P4VP block in the copolymers. The
comb-coil copolymers with x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.75 and 1.0 are prepared here, as they all display
cylinder-within-lamellae morphology. The volume fraction of PS block ranges from 0.19 to 0.28
depending on x (cf. Table 1). For the SAXS and TEM experiments, the samples were further
annealed at 150 oC in vacuum for 30 hrs prior to the measurements.
Large-Amplitude Oscillatory Shear Experiment. Large-amplitude oscillating shear was
performed to produce large-scale alignment of the microdomains in the samples with x = 1.0 and
0.5. The shear was carried out with a Linkam CSS 450 shear hot stage in the oscillatory mode
with the shear frequency of 0.1 Hz and the strain amplitude of 50 %. The sample was first sheared
at 135oC for 1h followed by cooling to 35 oC at 2oC/min.
Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements. SAXS measurements were performed
using a Bruker Nanostar SAXS instrument. The X-ray source, a 1.5 KW X-ray generator
(Kristalloflex 760) equipped with a Cu tube, was operated at 35 mA and 40 KV. The scattering
intensities and patterns were detected by a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector (Bruker

identical morphological features, namely, the PS cylinders pack in hexagonal and tetragonal lattice
at x = 0.75 and 1.0 and x = 0.5 and 0.6, respectively (cf. Supporting Information). This implies
that the lattice structure is governed by x but not by the molecular weight of the copolymer.
SAXS profiles in the low-q region have also been collected to establish the packing symmetries.
Figure 4 shows the low-q SAXS profiles of the isotropic samples of PS12K-b-P4VP12K(DBSA).
For x =1.0 the SAXS intensity displays a series of lattice peaks with the position ratio of 1: 31/2: 41/2,
signaling the formation of hexagonally packed PS cylinders23 with the characteristic domain
spacing (D) of 31.4 nm calculated from the primary peak position (qm) via D= 2 /q m. The broad
peak marked by “i =1’ coresponds to the first maximum of the cylinder form factor. The average 
radius of the cylindrical domains (R) calculated from the position of this peak (qmi=1) via R =
4.98/qmi=1 is 7.8 nm24.
The copolymer with x = 0.5 exhibits a different scattering pattern. Here a scattering peak
situating at ca. 0.4 nm-1 emerges as a shoulder of the primary peak prescribing the domain spacing
of 25.5 nm. The positions of the peaks now follow the ratio of 1: 21/2: 41/2: 51/2. The 21/2 and 51/2
peaks are not consistent with any diffraction order from the hexagonal lattice; a tetragonal or square
lattice can however give rise to these diffraction peaks arising from the (11) and (21) planes23. The
radius of the cylinder deduced from the position of the first form factor maximum is 6.5 nm. The
scattering pattern remains unperturbed upon heating to 200 oC, indicating that the tetragonal lattice
is thermally stable (cf. Supporting Information).
Two-dimensional (2-D) SAXS patterns are further obtained using the samples with large-scale
alignment of the microdomains produced by large-amplitude oscillating shear. The
“through-view” and the “edge-view” patern are obtained by the incident X-ray traveling parallel
and perpendicular to the shear flow direction (i.e. z axis), respectively. Figure 5(a) shows the 2-D
SAXS patterns of the system with x = 1.0. The through-view pattern displays six spots from the
(10) planes, indicating that the PS cylinders are aligned in the flow direction and pack with
hexagonal symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the flow direction. The edge-view pattern
exhibits two arcs at the equator arising from the (10) planes. Two additional arcs associated with
the lamellar stacks formed by the comb blocks are identified in the outer region of this 2-D pattern.
The fact that these two arcs are located in the meridian indicates that the lamellar interface lies
perpendicularly to the cylinder axis, giving rise to the orthogonal orientation as illustrated in Figure
5(b)18,25.
Figure 6(a) displays the 2-D SAXS patterns of the copolymer with x = 0.5. Tetragonal packing of
the PS cylinders is clearly evidenced by the through-view pattern showing four diffraction spots
from the (10) planes in the four quadrants. The smaller-scale lamellar structure gives rise to a
diffuse ring in the through-view pattern and two spots in the meridian of the edge-view pattern.

blocks). The edge-on organization observed at x = 0.5 and 0.6 must hence be induced by another
driving force that outweighs the weaker interlamellar interaction so as to force the lamellae to adopt
an unfavorable arrangement. We propose that this driving force originates from the
conformational entropy of PS blocks. From the position of the first form factor peak, the average
radius of the PS cylinders in the hexagonal lattice is found to be 1.3 nm larger than that associated
with the tetragonal lattice. This means that the PS blocks in the former are more stretched and
hence possess a lower conformational entropy. In this case, the significant stretching of
P4VP(DBSA) blocks normal to the cylinder interface to form orthogonally oriented lamellae forces
the covalently linked PS blocks to stretch accordingly. At lower overall binding fractions, the
relaxation of PS blocks to gain higher conformational entropy dominates and forces the DBSA side
chains to lie flatly on the xy plane; in this case, the width of the comb block prescribes a larger
width for the junction point projected onto the xy plane and hence alleviates the stretching of PS
blocks.
Conclusions
We have shown that the hierarchical assembly of a comb-coil diblock copolymer system
generates hexagonally or tetragonally packed cylinders embedded in the lamellar mesophase
organized by the comb blocks. The packing symmetry is determined by the orientation of the
lamellae with respect to the cylindrical domains prescribed by the overall grafting density of the
comb blocks. Hexagonal lattice is favored for the orthogonal orientation, while tetragonal packing
becomes the stable structure when the lamellae adopt the edge-on arrangement. The main
difference between the present system and the conventional coil-coil diblock copolymers lies in the
molecular order of the matrix phase, where the cylindrical domains here are embedded in a liquid
crystalline matrix rather than a disordered liquid phase. The exploitation of liquid crystallinity is
an effective approach for expanding the morphological window of block copolymers. In particular,
various novel microdomain structures, including wavy lamellae29, zigzag lamellae30 and arrowhead
domains29, have been created through the modification of interfacial curvature by the liquid
crystalline order. The present work along with the previous ones13,14 attest that the lattice structure
can also be modified by the liquid crystalline order. Comparing with the liquid crystalline rod-coil
diblock copolymers, the comb-coil system may exhibit more versatile structure variation due to the
adjustable mesomorphic order or liquid crystallinity of the comb blocks by the grafting density.
This is demonstrated by the accessibility of both hexagonal and tetragonal lattices in a single
PS-b-P4VP(DBSA) system with different binding fractions.

Earlier we had shown that due to the strong repulsion between the ionic PANI backbone and
non-ionic PEO side chains, PANI(PEOPA) complexes formed a microphase-separated lamellar
morphology consisting of alternating ionic (PANI backbone and phosphate group of PEOPA) and
non-ionic (PEO side chain) layers.14 Here we will show that apart from this small-scale assembly
the complex further self-organizes on a much larger length scale leading to nanowires with ca. 30
nm in diameter. Figure 1(a-c) shows the TEM micrographs obtained from the ultrathin sections of
the stoichiometric PANI(PEOPA) complex stained by OsO4. The TEM images in Figure 1(a) were
obtained when viewed normal to the surface of the film (through-view) whereas those in Figure
1(b-c) were viewed parallel to the surface along two perpendicular directions (edge-view and
end-view). In the through-view and edge-view, TEM micrographs show alternating bright and dark
layers of uniform thickness which are oriented in one direction. The dark region corresponds to the
PANI-rich region. The thickness of the dark and the bright layers is found to be ca. 30 and 40 nm,
respectively in both through- and edge-view and the length of the nanostructures extends up to
several micrometers. These 1-D aligned nanostructures spread nearly over the whole film.
Furthermore, the TEM micrograph obtained in end-view (Figure 1(c) reveals cross-section of
rodlike structures. This shows that the large-scale structures observed are in fact nanowires.
Therefore, the dark regions correspond to the well-ordered PANI nanowires which itself contains
another self-assembled structure on a smaller scale reported in our previous work.14 Moreover, we
speculate that the bright regions consist of unbonded PEOPA chains as well as poorly-doped PANI
chains which did not have the sufficient conjugation length to form the extended nanowire
structure.
The 2-D synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) pattern further supports the TEM
results. Figure 2(a) and (b) shows the 2-D SAXS patterns obtained when X-ray was passed along
different directions through the as-cast film. In the thorough-view the SAXS pattern shows a weak
and broad circular reflection at q ~ 1.00 nm-1 (Figure 2(a)). However, in the edge-view the SAXS
pattern displays two bright arcs in the equatorial direction superimposing on the weak circular
reflection (Figure 2(b)). This reveals the presence of two kinds of small-scale structure with the
characteristic length scale of 6.28 nm in the complex. One is isotropic and has relatively poor order,
which gives rise to the diffuse circular reflection in the SAXS pattern; the other is highly
anisotropic which gives rise to the bright arcs superimposing on the diffuse reflection. It must be
mentioned here that the observed scattering pattern contains no contribution from the lamellar
crystallites of PEO which is in melt state at room temperature.

understanding may provide a new strategy for the design of one-dimensional nanostructured
materials with unique electronic and photonic functions.
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel self-assembly process in a complex of PANI with
PEOPA that results in the formation of hierarchical nanostructures with two length scales. The
smaller-scale lamellae formed by the well-doped PANI chains further self-organize on a much
larger scale resulting in highly oriented nanowires of fairly uniform diameter in the sub-50 nm
range, which is one of the smallest achieved till date from a template-less procedure. The synthetic
procedure of the complex is easy; moreover, since the nanostructures are processed from aqueous
solution, the procedure is environmentally friendly.

用 X 光的散射圖譜來判定系統中的特殊規則排列。穿透式電子顯微鏡(TEM)實驗室將樣品薄
片用 pH=7的磷鎢酸(PTA)負染色法(negative stain)，利用磷鎢酸沉積於 PMMA鏈段上，增加
PMMA 區域的電子密度，使 PMMA 區呈現黑色，與 P3HT 區域形成對比，以進行形態之觀
察。廣角度 X光散射(WAXS)實驗則是利用國家同步輻射中心 17A1光束進行實驗。
結果與討論
圖 1為 P3HT47-b-PMMA220 as-cast 膜之變溫 SAXS圖譜，室溫及 50℃的 SAXS圖譜中，在
q~0.53 nm-1可觀察到類似 form factor scattering的散射貢獻，此乃是由於 P3HT及 PMMA鏈段
微相分離產生 P3HT microdomain，此 domain所造成 form factor scattering之貢獻。由於僅觀
察到一個 form factor scattering，故無法判定 P3HT microdomain 為何種幾何形狀，但從 P3HT
的體積分率 (fP3HT=0.29)判斷，此 domain 最有可能為圓柱。如果此 microdomain 為圓柱，則
其 form factor scattering第一個散射峰位置(qmax,1)與圓柱 microdomain之平均半徑(R)有 qmax,1R
= 4.98此關係，帶入式中可算出 R值(R=4.98/0.53)為 9.4 nm。另外，在 q=1.23 nm-1有一明顯
散射峰，其所對應之特性尺度為2π/1.23nm-1 =5.1 nm，此尺寸與 P3HT均聚物所呈現之 4.2 nm
結構之尺寸相近，故我們認為 P3HT 均聚物及 P3HT47-b-PMMA220雙團聯式共聚物在 1.2~1.5
nm-1 所呈現之散射峰所代表的是相同的結構，當溫度上升到 90℃，SAXS 圖譜中 P3HT
microdomain之 form factor scattering和 1.23 nm-1散射峰均消失了，當溫度冷卻回 40℃和 30℃
兩個散射峰更為明顯。由圖譜比較，可以看出當冷卻回 30℃時，1.23 nm-1左右之散射峰變的
較為尖銳，意味著此結構變得較為規則，故由圖譜可得知此 P3HT47-b-PMMA220 雙團聯式共
聚物系統有兩種不同尺寸之奈米結構共存，大尺度之結構(約 20 nm)為 P3HT microdomains，
由 P3HT鏈段與 PMMA鏈段微相分離所產生；而小尺度之結構(約 5 nm)為 P3HT microdomain
中 P3HT 鏈段進一步組裝形成之奈米結構，此結構應與 P3HT 均聚物形成之奈米線相同，即
在共聚物中，P3HT microdomain亦形成數奈米尺度之奈米線結構。
圖 2(A)為 P3HT47-b-PMMA220 as-cast 膜之變溫 SAXS圖譜，在溫度範圍為 30℃到 75℃之
間，在 q=1.33 nm-1有一明顯的散射峰，代表有一尺寸為 4.7 nm的規則結構存在。但隨著溫度
上升至 80℃時，此散射峰消失，此顯示一有序-無序狀態轉化(order-disorder transition, ODT)
發生。圖 2(B)為 SAXS降溫圖譜，溫度範圍從 85℃降回到 35℃，當溫度下降至 65℃時，此
散射峰又出現了，故此奈米規則結構又再度形成，隨著溫度的持續下降，此散射峰強度有明
顯的增強。代表 P3HT47-b-PMMA220 共聚物的特性尺度為 5 nm 的自組裝結構具熱可逆性

nm-1 之散射峰代表 P3HT 鏈段形成一間距為 1.6 nm 之層狀結構，此散射峰強度
P3HT47-b-PMMA220明顯比 P3HT 均聚物弱許多，而且散射峰較為寬廣，這是由於 PMMA鏈
段抑制了 P3HT鏈段的層狀規則排列，但是卻增進了一 5 nm結構之形成，而造成 1.23 nm-1
處產生一明顯的散射峰，即此 5 nm結構因為 PMMA鏈段存在抑制了 P3HT鏈段全面規性層
狀排列而產生。P3HT均聚物在 16.3 nm-1處之散射峰為噻吩環緊密π-π堆疊所造成，其熱穩
定性相當好，當溫度升到 150℃此堆疊仍然存在，而在 P3HT47-b-PMMA220共聚物中 P3HT鏈
段的噻吩環雖然仍形成π-π堆疊，但較為鬆散，且其熱穩定性較差，隨著溫度上升至 70℃，

由實驗結果顯示 P3HT47-b-PMMA220 rod-coil雙團聯式共聚物系統有兩種不同尺寸之奈米自
組裝結構共存，大尺度之結構(約 20 nm)為 P3HT microdomains，是由 P3HT與 PMMA鏈段微
相分離所形成，而 PMMA 鏈段為連續相。小尺度之結構(約 5 nm)為 P3HT microdomains 中
P3HT鏈段進一步組裝形成之奈米結構，因為 P3HT鏈段與 PMMA鏈段連結，使 junction points
固定在界面上，而無法自由進行結晶程序，使的各 P3HT鏈段自行摺疊，形成截面間距約為 5
nm之奈米線結構，且在各奈米線中仍有間距為 1.6 nm的層狀結構，奈米線長軸方向是藉由
噻吩環π-π作用力相吸引而堆疊，但是由於 PMMA鏈段的存在抑制了噻吩環的排列規則性及
平面性，導致π-π堆疊大多為較鬆散的狀態(d=4.2 Å)，只有少數為π-π堆疊較緊密的狀態(d=3.8
Å)，且π-π堆疊結構在加熱至 80℃便消失，5 nm的規則結構也隨之瓦解，示一有序-無序相
轉化發生，在降溫過程中奈米規則結構又再度形成，代表此結構具熱可逆性。
