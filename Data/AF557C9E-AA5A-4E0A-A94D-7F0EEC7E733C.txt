of Qn-1 and K2 for n ≥ 2, where Kn is a complete 
graph with n vertices and Q1 is K2; and torus 
(m,n) is Cartesian product of Cm and Cn, where 
Cx is a simple cycle with x vertices. To study 
properties on these topologies sometimes may be 
similar. In such cases, we may directly study the 
properties on Cartesian product of graphs to 
obtain more general results. 
 
However, many variants on these popular 
topologies can not be simply derived from 
Cartesian product, for example, the twisted cube, 
the crossed cube, and the Mobius cube are 
variants of the hypercube; the recursive circulant 
graph is a variant of Torus. Studies on properties 
on these topologies may also be similar 
sometimes. If there is an operation to use to 
combine some simpler graphs to generate these 
graphs, we may obtain more general results on 
such graphs. So we try to propose a new 
operation on graphs, called matching product, to 
establish more general graphs.  
 
In this study, we discuss super connectivity 
on matching product of graphs. We show that 
given two regular maximum-connected graphs G 
and H, and any matching collection M on (G, H), 
G *M H is super connected.  
 
 
2. Definitions and Notation 
 
In this paper, we concentrate on loopless 
undirected graphs. For the graph definition and 
notation, we follow [7]. G = (V,E) is a graph if V 
is a finite set and E is a subset of { (a,b) | (a,b) is 
an unordered pair of V}. We say that V is the  
vertex set and E is the edge set. Two vertices a 
and b are adjacent if (a,b) is in E. A path is 
represented by <v0 , v1 , v2 … , vk >. We also 
write the path <v0 , v1 , v2 … ,vk > as < v0 , P1 , 
vi , vi+1 … , vj , P2 , vt , … , vk >, where P1 is the 
path < v0, v1 , … , vi > and P2 is the path < vj , 
vj+1 , … , vt >. A cycle is a path with at least three 
vertices such that the first vertex is the same as 
the last vertex.  
 
We define matching product as follows: 
Given two graphs G = (VG, EG) and H = (VH, EH), 
let M = {m(x,y) | x, y ∈ VG}, where for each (x,y), 
m(x,y) is a permutation on VH if (x,y) ∈ EG or no 
definition otherwise. We call M a matching 
collection on (G, H). Then G *M H is a graph (V, 
E) such that V = {vGvH | vG ∈ VG and vH ∈ VH} 
and E = { (uGuH, vGvH) | vH = m(uG, vG)(uH) if (uG, 
vG) ∈ EG; or (uH, vH) ∈ EH if uG = vG }. Figure 1 
illustrates the definition. By the definition, the 
n-dimensional twisted cube, TQn, can be obtained 
by TQn-1 *M1 K2 or by TQn-2 *M2 C4 with suitable 
matching collection M1, M2. The crossed cube, 
the recursive circulant graph, etc., can also be 
derived by matching product with suitable graphs 
and matching collections. 
 
The fault tolerance is a critical matter for 
parallel computing since there may be some 
vertices (computers) or edges (links) failed 
sometime. There are many studies
