Abstract 
Internet has been utilized worldwide, 
the number of users grow rapidly. The 
demand of bandwidth increases 
tremendously. A good switching 
technology is required, and optical 
packet switching (OPS) incorporating 
with wavelength division multiplexing 
(WDM) technology, which has 
high-speed switching capability, high 
data rate and format transparency, is an 
attractive in the near future. The topics 
of this search are to investigate optical 
packet switches under Markovian 
modeled self-similar traffic input and 
optical code division multiple access 
(OCDMA) system. 
First, we investigate the loss behavior 
of optical packet switches (OPSes) 
employing partial buffer sharing (PBS) 
mechanism to provide differentiated 
services under Markovian modeled 
self-similar traffic input. Two priority 
classes are considered; both are 
self-similar in nature and are fitted by 
two independent Markovian arrival 
processes (MAPs). The level of buffer 
threshold divides the state space of the 
buffer occupancy into two parts. Such a 
partition in turn gives the critical and 
non-critical periods which are assumed 
to occur alternatively. Accordingly, we 
investigate and analyze both the short 
term and long term performance 
measures. Pertinent analytical results are 
computed and then verified by 
simulation. Our analysis is useful in 
telling the optimal control of buffer of 
OPS handling self-similar traffic to 
provide differentiated services.  
Second, we make the switching 
performance of wavelength division 
multiplexing (WDM) optical packet 
switch (OPS) employing wavelength 
conversion (WC) techniques under 
Markovian modeled self-similar traffic 
input to point the benefit of wavelength 
conversion. The analytical results are 
calculated and verified by simulation. 
We propose a procedure to calculate the 
numerical results in order to reduce the 
effort of computation. The computation 
complexity of the analysis is then 
presented. Our analysis is useful in 
dimensioning the WDM OPS to obtain 
satisfactory performance. 
Last, we study two-dimensioned (2-D) 
Optical Code Division Multiple Access 
(OCDMA) techniques, several 2-D 
OCDMA systems were investigated, we 
have found that the Perfect Difference 
Code (PDC) have many advantages. 
Therefore the spectral/time OCDMA 
system utilizing PDC is investigated 
completely. The results show that this 
system has good performance. In 
addition, because the fibers are deployed 
in the cities and many residential areas, 
we also propose a spectral/spatial 2D 
OCDMA system, which may also 
applicable for wideband access network.

II  Loss Behavior Analysis 
Now we could analyze the loss 
behavior of OPS employing PBS 
mechanism with MAP modeled 
self-similar input traffic. For the sake of 
simplicity, two priorities are considered. 
Each priority traffic is characterized by a 
MAP emulating self-similar process. 
Higher priority (class 1) and lower 
priority (class 2) packets arrive at the 
system according to MAPs of states 1m  
and 2m , respectively. The above MAPs 
are characterized by the matrices 
{ (1), (1)}C D  and { (2), (2)}C D , 
respectively. The service time is 
generally and identically distributed 
with distribution function H(t). Let 
( ) ( )( 0, 1,2)kmD t m k≥ =  denote the 
matrices whose ( , )i j th element is the 
probability that given departure of class 
k at time 0, there is at least one packet 
left in the system and the process is in 
state i, the next departure of class k 
occurs no later than time t with the 
arrival process in state j, and during that 
service time there are m arrivals. Then 
( ) ( )kmD t  satisfies the following equation 
( ) [ ( ) ( ) ]

                                            1, 2.

When service time is deterministic and 
is h units/packet, then we have

It is obvious that the matrices ( )kmD  can 
be evaluated by comparing the 
coefficient of mz  on both sides of the 
above equation. This procedure is 
outlined in [18], wherein the complete 
proof or reference is not given. We shall 
prove the procedure in a simple way and 
propose a method to tell when the 
procedure could be terminated. We drop 
the index k for both classes. Then can be 
written as 
[ ]

=∑  
As [ ]C Dz he +  is analytic, we utilize the 
decay proposition (Cauchy’s estimate) 
of complex variables as follows. 
 
 Proposition 1: Cauchy’s Estimate 
Let the matrix function 
0
( ) mmma z a z
∞
== ∑  be analytic for 
terms, due to the presence of k! in the 
denominator, only finite number of 
terms are required to compute the 
matrices mD s . The procedure of 
computing the matrices mD s  can be 
terminated using Proposition 1. The 
procedure of computing the matrices 
mD s  can be terminated using 
Proposition 1. This is an alternative 
method to the method proposed in [10], 
[12], which works well too. 
Now consider the embedded 
Markov chain { , | 0}n nL J n ≥ at the 
departure epochs of the queueing system 
on the state space 
{( , , ) | 0 ,S b i j b K= ≤ ≤ 11 ,i m≤ ≤  
21 }j m≤ ≤ , where Ln denotes the buffer 
occupancy and Jn denotes the phase of 
superposed MAP. For the sake of 
convenience, a queueing system is said 
to be at level b, if its buffer occupancy is 
equal to 1b −  (excluding the one at 
service). Under the operation of PBS 
mechanism with the level of threshold 
,  0K d d− ≥ , the embedded Markov 
chain has an irreducible transition 
probability matrix P that is given by

In above, the matrix G consists of the 
conditional probabilities that system is 
idle. The fundamental arrival rate of 
class k packets 
is ( ) ( ) ( ) ,  1, 2,k k D k e kλ π= =  where 
( )kπ  is the steady probability vector of 
C(k)+D(k). Then the traffic intensity is 
given as (1) (2)( ) [ ( )]E H tρ λ λ= + .  
From the operation of PBS 
mechanism, it is clear that high priority 
packet loss occurs buffer is full, whereas 
low priority packet loss happens due to 
the buffer occupancy threshold. Then, 
by definition, the steady state high 
priority packet loss probability ( )hpP  
and the steady state low priority packet 
loss probability ( )lpP  are respectively 
given as 
     
     
hpP Mean of high priority packet loss
Mean of high priority packet arrival
=  
     
     
lpP Mean of low priority packet loss
Mean of low priority packet arrival
=  
Firstly, the mean number of high priority 
and low priority packet arrivals are 
(1) [ ( )]E H tλ  and (2) [ ( )]E H tλ , 
respectively. Secondly, let 
0 1( , , , )Ky y y y= … , where 
1 2,1,1 ,1,2 , ,
( , , , )k k k k m my y y y= … , k∀ , is the

where β  is the initial probability 
vector of transient states and is of the 
form 1[0,0, ,0, ].K dβ − −…  This is 
followed from the fact that buffer 
occupancy starts at 1K d− −  in every 
non-critical period except the first one. 
The vector ¹0 is the zero vector of 
appropriate dimension. Similarly, for the 
case of critical period, consider the 
transition probability matrix of 
absorbing Markov chain that has 
transient states Sc and absorbing states

where α  is the initial probability 
vector of the transient states. Now the 
problem of finding the mean lengths of 
critical and non-critical periods are 
reduced to the problem of finding the 
initial probability vectors α  and β , 
which can be computed as follows. 
Consider the first absorbing 
Markov chain. Let rij be the probability 
of being absorbed in the state , ci j S∈ , 
starting in transient state , nci j S∈ . 
Then for each cj S∈ , we have the 
following relation 
nc
ij ij is sj
s S
r q q r
∈
= + ∑  
In the above relation, the first term 
corresponds to a transition from 
transient state to absorbing state directly, 
whereas the second term corresponds to 
the transitions from a transient state to 
other transient states and then to 
absorbing state. The above relation can 
be written in matrix form as follows: 
, ,nc nc c nc ncR P P R= +  
1
,. .,      ( ) .nc nc nc ci e R I P P
−= −  
The matrix 1( )ncI P
−−  is the 
fundamental matrix of the absorbing 
Markov chain under consideration. Rnc is 
the transition matrix where the chain 
starts in transient states and ends up in 
an absorbing state. Similarly for the case 
of the second absorbing Markov chain, 
analogous to Rnc, we have the matrix Rc 
that can be obtained as 
1
,( ) ' ,c c nc cR I P P
−= −  
where ,'nc cP  is the last column of the 
matrix Pc;nc and is equal to 0[ ,0, ,0]D … . 
The matrix ,'nc cP  is followed from the 
fact that for a non-critical period, it 
correlation decay rate, ρ , squared 
coefficient of variation, 2c , the first 
three moments, m1, m2, and m3, have 
been calculated. The correlation decay 
rate ρ  is positive in each case, hence 
one could achieve the desired 2-state 
MAP with these high dimensional 
MAPs [24]. Moreover, all the cases 
satisfy the inequalities 2c  > 1 and 
2

> +  which are the necessary 
conditions to be satisfied by the original 
distribution in order to have phase-type 
distribution by matching the first three 
moments [25]. Following [25], we could 
have phase type distribution, thereby the 
approximated 2-state MAP could be 
obtained. 
Table I lists the values of 
aforementioned traffic descriptors of the 
original 16-state MAPs, for which we 
follow the algorithms in [9] to fit a 
self-similar traffic with mean arrival rate, 
λ  = 1, variance, 2σ = 0.6, over the 
time-scale range [102; 107] in three 
different traffic cases with Hurst 
parameters, H = 0.7, H = 0.8, and H = 
0.9, and the corresponding ones of the 
approximated 2-state MAPs.

Approximated 2-State MAPs. 
 
 
We illustrate the packet loss 
probability against the traffic load for 
the MAP/D/1/K queues under the inputs 
of the above two MAPs with traffic 
descriptors shown in Table I, when 
buffer depth equals 10 and H = 0.7 in 
Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, we observe how 
accurate the approximated 2-state MAP 
is. The figures in the cases of H = 0.8 
and H = 0.9 could not be shown here. 
However, we do observe that the 
accuracy of the approximation becomes 
worse when H increases. By applying 
this approximate model, it is obvious 
that the computation complexity is 
reduced by 38  = 512 times.

computing the matrices nA s  can be

III  Simulation Results 
We first illustrate the loss 
probabilities against the traffic intensity 
pertaining to the analytical and the 
simulation results of MAP/D/c/K queues 
and the simulation ones of the same 
queues under the fractional Brownian 
traffic (FBT) input in Figs. 8(a)-9(c). 
The MAP shown in Figs. 8(a)-9(c) is 
obtained by fitting the FBT traffic with 
mean arrival rate λ  = 1, variance 2σ  
= 0.6, and Hurst parameter H = 0.7 over 
a typical time-scale 2 7[10 ,10 ]  
following the method proposed in [9]. 
From these figures, we observe that our 
analysis is pretty accurate. 
By showing the accuracy of our 
analysis, we then analyze the 
performance of WDM OPS employing 
wavelength conversion under Markovian 
modeled self-similar traffic input, 
according to the related system

The mxn of many 2-D OOCs are 
constrained by certain relations [42]. 
The 2-D OOCs with arbitrary 
combination of m and n are proposed 
[43], where m≤ n, we have applied the 
proposed 2-D OOCs to the spectral/time 
OCDMA systems. 
  Another type of 2-D OCDMA 
systems employ multi-fibers. Therefore 
the data bits are spread in the time 
domain and spatial domain. The partial 
modified prime (PMP) codes are applied 
in the system. Because the system can 
suppress the phase-induced intensity 
noise (PIIN), it also has very good 
performance [44]. 
 
Ⅱ The 2-D spectral/time OCDMA 
system 
  The receiver structure of the 2-D 
spectral/time OCDMA system using Pd 
codes is shown in Fig. 13 [43]. We 
assume the system is chip synchronous 
among users since it is the worst case of 
the performance. The average photon 
arrival rateΣ  per pulse is given by 
hf
pwη=Σ                             
whereη  is the APD quantum efficiency, 
wp  is the received optical signal power, 
h  is the plauck’s constant, and f  is 
the optical frequency. The optical signal 
at the output of the second hard limiter 
has “on” and “off” two level which are 
denoted by state 1S and 0S . The photon 
arrival rates for state 1S and 0S  are 
Σ and zero. With the Gaussian 
probability density function (pdf) 
assumption, the output current bϕ  of 
the photo detector is given by [45]

second can completely remove the

bit “ i ” is transmitted. If “o” is sent, the

Ⅲ-1 System Architecture 
The proposed system Architecture is 
shown in Fig 14. The structures of the 
transmitter and receiver are depicted in 
Figs 15 and 16 [43].

filter out the undesired optical signals 
sent from other users and thus eliminate 
MUI. Moreover, since no undesired 
optical signal sent from other users can 
be delivered to the photodiode of the 
receiver, the PIIN is suppressed greatly.   
Ⅲ-2 Performance Analysis 
In order to simplify the analysis, 
some assumptions are given as follows 
[48-50]:  
1) The broadband light source is ideally 
unpolarized and has a flat spectrum 
over [fc-Δf/2, fc+Δf/2], where fc is the 
central frequency and Δf is the 
bandwidth of the light source;  
2) Each spectral slice of the encoded 
signals has identical bandwidth; 
3) Each user has equal transmission 
power at the receiver; and 
4) Bit streams sent from different users 
reach the receiver synchronously.  
In the following analysis, the intensity 
noise, the shot noise, and thermal noise 
are considered. The effect of receiver’s 
dark current is neglected. In general, the 
photocurrent noise that occurs during the 
detection of thermal light, which is 
produced by a broadband light source, 
can be expressed as [48]

where G and Fe are average gain and 
excess noise factor of an avalanche 
photodiode (APD), e is the electron’s 
charge, B is the noise-equivalent 
electrical bandwidth of the receiver, τc is 
the coherence time of the light source, 
Kb is the Boltzmann’s constant, Tn is the 
absolute receiver noise temperature, RL 
is the receiver load resistance, Pin is the 
optical power incident on the APD, and 
R is the responsivity of the APD.  
Therein, R is given by R=ηe/hfc, 
where η is the quantum efficiency of the 
APD and h is the Planck’s constant. Pin 
can be expressed as  
∫∞= 0 )( dffSPin , 
where S(f) is the single sideband power 
spectral density of the broadband light 
source. The excess noise factor, eF , can 
be written as 
)2)(1( 1−−−+= GkGkF eee , 
where ek  is the effective ionization 
ratio of the APD. In (16), the items at 
right hand side result from the PIIN, 
shot noise, and thermal noise, 
respectively. Note that the coherence 
time can be expressed as [44]

codes and M-matrices codes are also 
degraded to a unusable extent. Only the 
proposed system can still keep its 
performance in an acceptable level, i.e. 
the BER is smaller than 10-9. In Fig. 8, 
the source power is set to -15dBm. We 
can find that the proposed system can 
still accommodate 147 simultaneous 
users at BER around 910− .  
In Fig. 19, the BER versus the source 
power is shown at the number of 
simultaneous users equal to 130. As we 
can see, the systems using 2-D perfect 
different codes and the M-matrices 
codes cannot make BER lower than 10-9 
when the source power is below 0dBm. 
However, the proposed system can well 
meet this requirement even when the 
power is around -15dBm. 
According to the numerical results 
shown in Figs. 17-19, it can be 
concluded that the proposed system is of 
much better performance when the 
optical power is low. In other words, the 
power demand of the proposed system is 
much lower than that of other systems.  
 Fig. 20 shows the BER of the 
proposed system versus the source 
power as the number of simultaneous 
users is 49 and the parameters of the 
PMP codes are set to (p, M) = (5, 2), (7, 
3), (11, 2), or (11, 5). It is easy to find 
that the proposed system with the setting 
of (p, M) = (5, 2) needs the least source 
power to meet the requirement of 
BER=10-9 while the one with the setting 
of (p, M) = (11, 5) needs the most. This 
is because that, when the source power 
is fixed, the transmitter of the proposed 
system using the PMP codes with (p, M) 
= (5, 2) causes the least power loss 
during spectral encoding and thus has 
the largest output signal power.  
As the transmitted digital data is 1, the 
power loss resulting from spectral 
encoding can be expressed as  
sloss PMp
pP ⋅⎟⎟⎠
⎞
⎜⎜⎝
⎛ −−= 211 . 
In condition that the code length is fixed, 
i.e. the value of p is fixed, decreasing the 
value of M can reduce the encoding 
power loss and thus to reduce the 
required source power. However, 
decreasing the value of M will also 
reduce the code size and hence the 
number of simultaneous user that can be 
accommodated in the proposed system is 
also reduced. Therefore, there is a 
tradeoff in selection of the value of M.

the results of using MAPs to emulate 
self-similar traffic and apply them to the 
investigation of performance analysis of 
WDM OPS employing wavelength 
conversion techniques. Our analysis is 
pretty accurate and can capture the 
impact of self-similar traffic upon the 
switching performance of WDM OPS 
employing wavelength conversion 
techniques to some extent. We also 
propose an efficient procedure to avoid 
large computation efforts in solving the 
resultant MAP/D/c/K queues and 
analyze the computation complexity in a 
concise way. Our analysis holds good 
and is in line with the conclusions of 
other investigations made by simulations. 
This feature makes our analysis valuable 
and useful in dimensioning WDM OPS 
employing wavelength conversion 
techniques under self-similar traffic 
input.  
Last, we study the Spectral/time 
OCDMA system employing PDC. This 
system is applicable to the access 
network such as PON. In addition, we 
propose a novel 2-D OCDMA network 
architecture to further suppress PIIN and 
lower the demand of source power. In 
the proposed network architecture, the 
receivers are divided into p groups. The 
receivers in each group correspond to 
one code group of the PMP codes and 
connect to the outputs of the same star 
coupler. Since the cross-correlation 
between any two of the PMP code 
sequences in the same group is zero, the 
code sequences assigned to the receivers 
in the same group are mutually 
orthogonal. The transmitters of the 
proposed network architecture only 
transmit the spectrally encoded signals 
to the receivers via the start coupler 
corresponding to the code group of the 
adopted code sequence. Hence, the 
receivers can use the orthogonal 
property of the code groups of the PMP 
codes to completely filter out the 
undesired signals sent from other users. 
In this way, the MUI and PIIN caused by 
other users can be eliminated. Moreover, 
since the transmitters only need to 
transmit the spectrally encoded signals 
to one group of the receivers, the signal 
power lost in the start coupler can be 
reduced. Thus, the demand of source 
power is greatly reduced. According to 
the numerical results, it is proven that 
the source power of the proposed system 
can be much lower than that of the 
system using MQC codes, M-matrices 
codes, and 2-D perfect difference codes. 
When the parameters of the PMP codes 
are set to p=7 and M=3, the spectral 
width is 30nm, and the transmission rate 
is 155Mbps, the proposed system can 
still accommodate 147 simultaneous 
users with the source power equal 
to –15dBm. Because the proposed 
system can function well with low 
source power, it is possible to employ 
low-cost light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in 
practical implementation. Moreover, by 
using the group orthogonal property of 
PMP codes, the receivers can use a set 
of FBGs to remove MUI and PIIN
