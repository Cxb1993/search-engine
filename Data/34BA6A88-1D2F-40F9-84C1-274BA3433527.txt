inclinations of 31.74 degrees and altitudes of 
800 Km. Also, when the mid-orbit satellites were 
proposed, only 5 satellites orbiting at altitudes of 
4272 Km were required. In Ref. [8], Ma 
presented an innovative satellite positioning 
system. The design of a low Earth orbit satellite 
positioning system was proposed (Again, why 
not give the name of the author and use active 
wording). The study presented an example of a 
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation 
providing the positioning function over a certain 
region. The proposed constellation consisted of 
75 satellites orbit at four different inclinations. 
The satellites were in orbits at heights of about 
800 km. They were able to provide the 
positioning function over a region with a radius 
of about 3000 km, centered at the point with a 
longitude of 122ºE and latitude of 25ºN. In Ref. 
[9], a satellite constellation with 36 satellites 
orbits on 9 orbit planes with altitudes of 800 Km 
and inclinations of 35 degrees were able to 
provide instantaneous communication over an 
area with a radius of 2000 km centered in 
Taiwan. Some other preview work on 
constellation by the present author are given in 
Ref. [10~13]. 
This study presents a low Earth orbit 
constellation which provides the communication 
function over a region centered in Taiwan, with 
radius of 500km, 1000km, 1500km, 2000km and 
2500km, and with orbit altitudes of 800 km and 
1500 Km.(as shown in Figure 1), Several 
constellations are studied. Two constellations 
with satellite orbit altitudes of only 800 Km and 
1500 Km are considered first. For the radius the 
results show that 27 satellites are required with 
an orbit altitude of 800 Km and 15 satellites for 
an orbit altitude of 1500 Km. The asymmetrical 
natures of constellations are also presented. The 
first case presents the results when a single 
inclination angle is used. For example, covering 
the region with a radius of 2000 Km, 20 
satellites orbiting at altitudes of 1500 Km and 10 
satellites orbiting at altitudes of 800 Km with 
inclinations of 35 degrees are required. In the 
second case examining the asymmetrical nature 
of constellations, two inclinations angles are 
used. For example, covering the region with a 
radius of 2000 Km, 20 satellites orbiting at 
altitudes of 1500 Km with inclinations of 35 
degrees and 9 satellites orbiting at altitudes of 
800 Km with inclinations of 30 degrees are 
required. 
 
2. MISSION REQUIREMENTS 
To perform the communication function the 
constellation requires that: (1) the satellites of 
the constellation are the same and that the 
satellite attitude control system adopts the 
gravity gradient control system in order to point 
the antenna to the Earth. (2) Taiwan is taken as 
the center of the regions, and at any time the 
ground can communicate via satellite link. The 
communication infrastructure is assumed to be 
Satellite-Cross-Link. The frequencies used are 
the same as IRIDIUM, using L-Band, 
1616-1625.5 MHz, for the up/down link, 
Ka-Band for inter-satellites communication. (3) 
In this study, the altitudes of orbits are between 
800-1500 Km, and the inclinations are the 
variables chosen to obtain the minimum number 
of satellites required. (4) The number of 
satellites required is for real-time 
communication only and no backup satellites are 
counted. When the elevation of the ground 
antenna is less than 5 degrees, the signal is 
absorbed by the atmosphere, thus, decreasing the 
signal noise (S/N) ratio, and lowering the 
receiving signal from the satellite [10]. 
Therefore, the elevation angle of 5 degrees is the 
assumed value for this study. 
 
3. COMMUNICATION SATELLITE 
CONSTELLATION DESIGN 
  A large number of constellations may 
satisfy a particular mission. Usually, 
constellations are designed so that the 
satellites have similar orbits, eccentricity 
and inclination, so that any perturbations 
affect each satellite in approximately the 
same way. In this way, the geometry can be 
preserved without excessive station keeping, 
thereby, reducing the fuel usage and 
increasing the life of the satellites. Another 
consideration is that the phasing of each 
satellite in an orbital plane maintains 
sufficient separation to avoid collisions or 
interference at orbit plane intersections. 
Circular orbits are popular, because, with 
such orbits, the satellites are at a constant 
altitude requiring a constant strength signal 
to communicate.  
The Walker Delta Pattern constellation 
has become a popular type of class of 
circular orbit geometry. As proposed by 
John Walker, this type of constellation has 
an associated notation to describe it which 
was proposed by [3].  Walker’s notation is 
as follows: i: t/p/f  
where: i is the inclination, t is the total 
number of satellites, p is the number of 
equally spaced planes and f is the relative 
spacing between satellites in adjacent planes. 
The change in true anomaly (in degrees) for 
equivalent satellites in neighboring planes is 
equal to f*360/t. For example, the Galileo 
Navigation system is a Walker Delta 
56°:27/3/1 constellation. This means that 
there are 27 satellites in 3 planes inclined at
