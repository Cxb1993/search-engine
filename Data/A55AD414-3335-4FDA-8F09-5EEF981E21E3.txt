INTRODUCTION
With the fast advance of navigation in consumer
applications, indoor positioning capability is now in high
demand. While radio signal strength has been used in
many indoor positioning systems before [1-6], the RSSI
measurements in indoor environments suffer from many
uncontrollable factors such as wall reflection, signal
fading or shadowing resulting from indoor objects or
human, etc. As a result RSSI based indoor positioning
can only achieve a few meters accuracy and such
accuracy level may not be adequate for many new
applications. Other systems such as PDR (pedestrian
dead-reckoning) systems [7] or vision based system are
also popular in indoor positioning but they are suffered
from other limitations. For example, dead-reckoning
systems use known initial position as a starting point but
deduce subsequent user positions by accumulating
relative movement measurements and the process suffers
from error accumulation problem. Vision based systems,
combined with algorithms such as SLAM [8], can
determine the user locations with respect to some
unknown but fixed feature points of the environment but
these algorithms are usually computation intensive and
require very powerful hardware platform to realize.
In this paper RSSI is aided by dead-reckoning relative
movement measurements to form a new positioning
system that provides better positioning accuracy than
conventional RSSI-only system in dynamic indoor
environments with varying signal propagation
characteristics. The RSSI propagation model in [9] is
used with real RSSI measurements from Zigbee
transmitters and receivers based on TI CC2430 chips [10].
A simulation environment is set up for the development
of the algorithms using characteristics derived from actual
signals. Several positioning algorithms based solely on
RSSI measurements are reviewed and the achievable
positioning accuracies are evaluated. Integrated
positioning algorithm using RSSI measurements and
relative displacements from DR system is introduced for
environments with exact RSSI model. The integrated
system achieves higher accuracy than RSSI-only system,
thanks to the lower uncertainties in user motion model
with the aids of DR inputs. The new positioning
algorithm is then modified to estimate the model
parameters and user positions simultaneously. The
algorithms showed good results in simulation cases for
dynamic indoor environments with changing RSSI model.
Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the
performance of the proposed algorithms and it is shown
that the addition of online RSSI model parameter
estimation in the algorithm enhances the positioning
accuracy in real-life situation.
RSSI MODELLING
The received signal strength is a function of the
transmitted power and the distance between the RF signal
transmitter and the receiver. The received signal strength
decrease with increased distance and is modeled as below
equation [9]:
RSSI = -(10nlog10d+A) (1)
where
RSSI is receiver signal strength index;
n is signal propagation constant, also named as
propagation exponent;
d is distance from sender;
A is received signal strength at a distance of one meter.
It is worth noting that both the parameters n and A in the
above equation are varying in different environments [11].
The value A should theoretically be equal in all directions.
However the antennas of the transmitter and the receiver
are not isotropic so A can be different in different
locations with different directions. A can also be affected
by the AGC feature often found in modern wireless
networks. On the other hand n is a parameter that
describes how the signal strength decrease when the
distance from the transmitter increases and is highly
dependent of the environment. It is challenging, if not
impossible, to find parameter values that are optimum for
all environments.
Figure 1 is the experimental result in an indoor corridor
environment using ZigBee:
Figure 1. RSSI measurements and model
The measurement statistics distributions, include averages
and standard deviations of RSSI at different distances, are
shown in the figure in deep blue color. A model with
parameters n=5.9 and A=-86 is determined to be the best
fit for the case. From figure 1 it can be seen that the
measurement noise increase with distance. The
uncertainties caused by the noises make the accurate
identification of n and A difficult. For example, fix A and
varying n from 3.9 to 8.9 or fix n and varying A from -76
to -96 all produce RSSI model curves that fit within the
measurement distributions. Tests in other environments
(not shown) have different model parameters.
RSSI BASED POSITION DETERMINATION
Figure 2 shows a simplified system for two-dimensional
location detection based on RSSI [9].
Figure 5. RLS position estimate result
The accuracy of the blind position estimates will depend
on the RSSI measurement error covariance v. In reality,
the RLS position estimates of the Zigbee system have
accuracy in the order of a few meters and may not be
accurate enough for some applications. To improve the
position estimate accuracy, knowledge of the blind node
motions should be utilized and optimal state estimation
theories such as Kalman Filter [12] can be used.
 Kalman filtering with motion models
Instead of allowing the blind node motion to be
completely random, motion model which relates the
current blind node position with previous ones can be
used to improve the estimation. The simplest motion
model is to assume the blind node position at time
instance k+1 are the position at last time instance k plus
some random motion. This model is called P-model and
was used to model the famous Brownian motions. Using
the blind node position (x, y) as states, the P-model can be
written as the following state equation:

In equation (5), wx and wy are the relative displacements
of the blind node and are assumed to be random, since
one does not have advanced knowledge of the motions.
To accommodate the actual displacement range of 10cm
in the simulation study, wx and wy are assumes to be zero
mean, white, Gaussian with covariance of 100 cm2. Since
the measurement equations are nonlinear, EKF (Extended
Kalman Filtering) [12] method can be used to estimate the
blind node positions. Figure 6 show the blind node
position estimate using EKF with P-model. Comparing
figure 5 with figure 6, it is clear that the blind node
position estimation is greatly improved by using EKF.
Figure 6. Position estimate using EKF with P-model
Instead of describing the blind node motion using the P-
model, a higher order motion model called PV-model that
describe a constant velocity motion can be used and it
matches more closely to the actual blind node motions in
the simulation study. The state equation using the PV-
model can be written as:

where the new statesx,y are the relative displacements
of the blind node and they are assumed to be different
from the relative displacements at previous time instance
by zero mean, white Gaussian noises wx, wy. In this
study wx, wy are both assumed to have covariance of 1
cm2. Together with the measurement equation (6), EKF
can be used to estimate the blind node positions. Figure
7 show the position estimate using EKF with PV-model.
As PV-model has a smaller process covariance matrix
comparing with P-model, the position estimates take more
motion dynamic model information into account. Since
the PV-model does describe the actual blind node motion
more accurately, the estimation result is more accurate.
Figure 7. Position estimate using EKF with PV-model
DEAD-RECKONING AIDED RSSI POSITIONING
When dead-reckoning sensors are available, relative
displacements can be measured directly and treated as
inputs instead of being considered as a state for estimation.
Figure 11 show the positioning result with both RSSI
model parameters n and A incorrect. Comparing with
figure 9 the positioning errors of figure 11 are even worse.
Figure 11. Position estimate with incorrect A and n
To deal with the changing parameters in different
environments, the system formulation is modified to
include all RSSI model parameters as states for estimation.

EXPERIMENTS
To further verify the result of dead-reckoning aided RSSI-
based positioning algorithm under dynamic environments,
experiments were conducted in NTUST laboratory.
Figures 13 and 14 show the path of the blind node in the
experiment and the testing environment. Due to hardware
limitations, only 2 Zigbee reference nodes are used in the
experiments and their locations are (0, 0) and (200, 0)
respectively. The blind node is located on a cart (as
shown in figure 15 which start from (70, 60) and travel
the rectangular path in clockwise direction.

Figure 15. Blind node setup
The RSSI model parameters in this environment are first
initialized to be n=5.9 and A=-86 for both reference nodes.
They are allowed to change during the experiments by the
algorithm. Figure 16 shows the blind node position
estimates using the RLS method. This result has error
level comparable to figure 5, in the order of a few meters.

The received signal strength is a function of the

The value A should theoretically be equal in all directions.
However the antennas of the transmitter and the receiver

In the figure, “reference nodes” are static nodes placed at
known positions while“blind node” is a nodethat receive
RF signals from all reference nodes and read out the
respective RSSI values . Distances from the blind node to
various reference nodes are derived from RSSI
measurements and these can be used to calculate the
position of the blind node. Consider m reference nodes
with known positions (x1, y1), (x2, y2), …, (xm, ym), and a
blind node with unknown position (x, y). With m RSSI
measurements, at any time instance k one can write

where the new statesx,y are the relative displacements
of the blind node and they are assumed to be different
from the relative displacements at previous time instance
by zero mean, white Gaussian noises wx, wy. In this
study wx, wy are both assumed to have covariance of 1
cm2. Together with the measurement equation (6), EKF
can be used to estimate the blind node positions. Figure
7 show the position estimate using EKF with PV-model.
As PV-model has a smaller process covariance matrix
comparing with P-model, the position estimates take more
motion dynamic model information into account. Since
the PV-model does describe the actual blind node motion
more accurately, the estimation result is more accurate.

DEAD-RECKONING AIDED RSSI POSITIONING
When dead-reckoning sensors are available, relative
displacements can be measured directly and treated as
inputs instead of being considered as a state for estimation.
The blind node motion can be desribed by the state
equation below:

Where x=(x, y)T is the state vector, u=(x, y)T is the

T is the process noise vector which is resulted
from dead-reckoning measurement errors and is assumes
to be zero mean, white and Gaussian. The process
covariance matrix Q=E[wTw] is assumed to be diag(25,
25) in the simulation study.
With the more accurate motion model and the exact
knowledge of relative displacement as inputs, the
accuracy of the blind node positions estimates can be
further improved, as shown in figure 8. The RMS of the
positioning errors is calculated as 33 cm, which is an
order of magnitude better than the RLS positioning
accuracy.

DR-AIDED RSSI POSITIONING IN DYNAMIC
ENVIRONMENTS
In reality, parameters for RSSI model can be varying in
different environments. When positioning in dynamic
indoor environments, one can move from one
environment to another with different RSSI model. It is
impossible to expect a set of RSSI model parameter to
work in all environments and large positioning errors can
resulted from parameter mismatches. In the simulation
below, RSSI model parameter n and A for all the
reference nodes under the environment are assumed to be
6 and -80. Two studies are conducted. In the first study,
the parameter A is set to -90 initially to match a case that
the reference node signal strength is varying due to
different transmitter power setting change or antenna gain
changes resulted from different orientation. In the second
study, both parameters n and A are set to 5 and -90
initially to simulate a change of environment.
 Dynamic Environment with parameter A change
Figure 9 show that with incorrect RSSI model parameter
A, even with the aiding of dead-reckoning information,
EXPERIMENTS
To further verify the result of dead-reckoning aided RSSI-
based positioning algorithm under dynamic environments,
experiments were conducted in NTUST laboratory.
Figures 13 and 14 show the path of the blind node in the
experiment and the testing environment. Due to hardware
limitations, only 2 Zigbee reference nodes are used in the
experiments and their locations are (0, 0) and (200, 0)
respectively. The blind node is located on a cart (as
shown in figure 15 which start from (70, 60) and travel
the rectangular path in clockwise direction.

Figure 15. Blind node setup
The RSSI model parameters in this environment are first
initialized to be n=5.9 and A=-86 for both reference nodes.
They are allowed to change during the experiments by the
algorithm. Figure 16 shows the blind node position
estimates using the RLS method. This result has error
level comparable to figure 5, in the order of a few meters.
Figure 16. RLS position estimate result
Figures 17 show the position estimate results using EKF
with PV models. Due to poor model parameter selection,
the estimates have errors for a few meters although the
estimated path does resemble the actual path thanks to
more trusts in motion model by using the PV-model.

Using a laser ranger [14] to scan the surrounding walls
and use the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm [15] to
calculate the corresponding relative displacements of the
blind mode, dead-reckoning aided RSSI positioning
algorithm as in equation (8) is used to calculate blind
node positions and the result is shown in figure 18 below.

positioning accuracy comparing with figure 16, the
