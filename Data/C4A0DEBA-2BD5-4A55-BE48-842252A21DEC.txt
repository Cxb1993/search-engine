focusing unit, the PDLC layer, and a back-side reflecting unit. Such a device is an essential 
element in an optical identification system.

1. Introduction 
 Optical retro-reflectors possess the ability to reflect light back along its incoming 
direction. They are already seen in many applications, ranging from the commonplace traffic 
signs [1] to the free-space optical communication systems built for military platforms [2-5]. 
Their potential of being used in an optical ID system has also been demonstrated [6-8]. There 
are two major types of retro-reflectors, the corner cube retro-reflector (CCR) consisting of 
three orthogonal mirrors, and the cat’s eye retro-reflector which combines a focusing lens and 
a reflecting mirror. 
 The retro-reflection efficiency of a CCR mainly depends on the orthogonality 
between mirrors and the mirror curvature, and has been comprehensively analyzed [9]. The 
3-dB acceptance angle, i.e. 3-dB field of view (FOV), of a hollow perfect CCR is intrinsically 
~ 10° [10]. The FOV can only be changed by filling the CCR with some non-air medium; 
for example, BK7 glass increases the FOV to ~ 15° [11]. Filler materials with higher 
refractive indices give greater FOVs; however, they are difficult to acquire and costly. 
Cat’s eye retro-reflectors can exhibit better FOVs if properly designed [10], but on the 
other hand, evaluating the performance of a cat’s eye retro-reflector is more complicated as 
many factors, such as the lens’s focal length, mirror curvature, and longitudinal distance and 
lateral offset (misalignment) between the lens and mirror, can all play a role in the cat’s eye 
efficiency, reflected beam’s direction and divergence, and acceptance angle. Therefore, 
performing device simulation and analysis prior to fabrication becomes crucial, particularly 
for micro cat’s eye manufactured with semiconductor process or the like where slight process 
deviation can lead to significant changes in the parameters described above. 
 Several commercial ray tracing software packages can be used for this purpose. 
However, they are mostly expensive, and the modeling, starting from drawing the device 
structure, tracing the optical rays, to calculating the efficiency, are generally time-consuming. 
In this project, we develop a simulation tool based on the ABCD ray transfer matrices. No 
drawing is required, and results for various conditions such as different device structures and 
incident angles can be easily obtained by simply changing the parameter values used for the 
calculation. 
 Most literature, particularly textbooks, demonstrates ray tracing with the 22 ABCD 
matrices in a 2-D space which is defined by the propagation direction, say z axis, plus a 
transverse axis, say x or y axis [12-16]. Our study confirms that with symmetric optical 
components, and under paraxial approximation, two sets of 22 ABCD matrices, each for a 
2-D subspace, can be used to describe the 3-D ray propagation completely, and we have 
employed this matrix-based 3-D ray tracing technique to model various cat’s eye retro-
reflectors. 
2. Ray Transfer Matrices 
 Consider a 2-D space defined by the propagation direction, z axis, and a transverse x 
axis. An optical ray entering the entrance pupil at position x with slope  passes through the 
system and exits from the exit pupil at position x' with slope '. The relation between (x, ) 
and (x', ') is determined by the 22 ABCD matrices of the elements within the system, as 
shown by many textbooks [12-14]. 
Many scientific papers demonstrated their matrix-based 3-D ray tracing with larger, 
say 44 [17-21], 55 [22], or 66 [23, 24], matrices, where in some special cases the 44 
matrix of an optical element could be exploded into two 22 matrices to trace the two 
orthogonal components of a ray, respectively [17, 20]. When coming across a symmetric

This, along with the fact that the position of the ray at the surface does not change after 
refraction, i.e., x' = x and y' = y, leads to the following two relations which involve 22 
matrices and ray vectors (position-slope pairs):

.  (11) 
 The two 22 matrices above, for the ray’s x and y components respectively, are 
identical to that used for a spherical surface in a 2-D space. Therefore, to describe the 3-D ray 
propagation through a spherical surface completely, we can first decompose the ray into x 
and y components, find their corresponding ray vectors (x, ) and (y, ), and treat each 
component as we normally do in a 2-D space. This is also true for a plane surface as a plane 
is obtained with R  . 
It should be noted that the above derivation, in which R is positive, considers a ray 
hitting a convex surface. However, we can find that when a concave surface is considered, all 
the equations (2)-(11) still stand but with R taken as negative.

2.2 Reflection off a Spherical Surface 
 Similar derivation can be made in the case of reflection off a spherical surface with a 
radius of curvature R, where R is positive for a concave surface and negative for a convex one.

 can be used to find the ray vectors of the x and y components after propagating for a

 The conclusion can extendedly apply to a refractive optical element like a lens, as ray 
propagation through such an element involves passing plane and/or spherical surfaces and 
propagating in medium which the optical element is made of. 
3. Analysis and Simulation 
 With the guides derived in Section 2, we build models to simulate the micro cat’s eye 
structure shown in Figure 3. The cat’s eye consists of a front-side focusing unit and a back-
side reflecting unit, separated by an air gap, a filling material (refractive index = nfill), or a 
smart film if tuning is required [8]. The front-side focusing unit is composed of a microlens 
(refractive index = nlens, 1) and a transparent carrier substrate (refractive index = nsubstrate, 1). 
The back-side reflecting unit bears the same structure except that the side with the microlens 
(refractive index = nlens, 2) is coated with reflective metal to form a concave mirror. 
Neglecting the thicknesses of the microlenses, the ABCD matrices of all elements shown in 
Fig. 3 are listed as follows.

A. Verification of Validity of the Proposed Matrix-based 3-D Ray Tracing 
Approach 
  We compare our modeling approach with two other methods, FRED (commercial ray 
tracing software) simulation and traditional 2-D ABCD matrix calculation, to verify its 
validity. The cat’s eye structures reported in [8] are analyzed and the results obtained with 
FRED are used as the standards. It is worth noting that the structures are not ideal cat’s eyes. 
In the simulations, the transmittances at the interfaces and the reflectivity of the back-side 
mirror are both set as 100%; the absorption within materials is not considered. The device 
dimensions are R1 = 0.495 mm, R2 = 0.801 mm, d1 = d2 = 0.15 mm, and dfill = 0.45 mm while 
the indices of refraction are nlens, 1 = nlens, 2 = 1.64, nsubstrate, 1 = nsubstrate, 2 = 1.5, and nfill = nair = 
1 (i.e. units separated by an air gap). 
 For the cat’s eye structure without a lateral x offset (misalignment) between the front 
and back units, all three simulation methods demonstrate a steep efficiency drop around the 
incident angle of 12.5° (Figure 5(a)). However, the traditional 2-D ABCD matrix method 
yields a significantly higher efficiency than that obtained by FRED. On the other hand, the 
curve calculated by the proposed matrix-based 3-D approach in this project well matches that 
from FRED; it deviates slightly from the FRED curve at large angles where paraxial 
approximation is less valid. 
 Introducing a lateral x offset (misalignment) of -0.02 mm, all methods show that the 
incident angle where maximum efficiency occurs shifts to ~ 5°(Figure 5(b)). Again, similar 
trends are observed: the traditional 2-D ABCD matrix approach significantly overestimates 
the efficiency; the curve calculated by our proposed method deviates slightly from the FRED 
curve at large angles. 
 When a lateral offset along the y direction (-0.02 mm) is introduced, the traditional 2-
D ABCD matrix method can no longer be used. The results from the proposed 3-D approach 
and FRED match well (Figure 5(c)).

B. Ideal Cat’s Eye 
 We then model an ideal cat’s eye. The dimensions of this cat’s eye are R1 = 0.495 mm, 
R2 = 1.268 mm, d1 = d2 = 0.15 mm, and dfill = 0.573 mm while the refractive indices are nlens, 1 
= nlens,2 = 1.64, nsubstrate, 1 = nsubstrate, 2 = 1.5, and nfill = nair = 1 (i.e. units separated by an air 
gap). These values satisfy Eq. (22) and (23), and all of them, except R2 and d, are the same as 
those in Section A. The result is plotted in Figure 7, where that obtained by FRED is also 
shown for comparison. According to our model, perfect retro-reflection with 100% efficiency 
occurs as long as the angle of incidence falls within the FOV defined by Eq. (25).

C. Deviation from an Ideal Cat’s Eye 
 There always exists fabrication inaccuracies or errors which make it impossible to 
manufacture an ideal cat’s eye. For example, lateral offsets/misalignement in the x and y 
directions between units can occur during the assembly step. The radius of curvature of the 
focusing lens or concave mirror most likely deviates from the targeted value if it is made 
using the thermal reflow process. The gap between the units may also be off the designed size. 
To learn the effects of these fabrication inaccuracies, in this section we analyze cat’s eyes 
which deviate from the ideal one. 
 
C.1 Lateral Offset/Misalignment 
 Consider that a lateral x offset/misalignment is introduced between the front-side and 
back-side units of the ideal cat’s eye, making it not ideal anymore. As the 
offset/misalignment increases, the FOV shifts and the maximum efficiency drops (Figure 
8(a)). A lateral y offset does not shift the FOV but does lower the efficiency (Figure 8(b)).

incident angle relations under different x misalignments are also shown. The efficiency-
incident angle curves exhibit flat regions, where efficiency is 1, just as that of the ideal cat’s 
eye. However, the retro-reflected beams are subjected to divergence of ~ 4°. In either device, 
the FOV shifts and the efficiency drops as the offset/misalignment increases, just as in the 
ideal cat’s eye.

4. Conclusion 
We develop a 3-D ray tracing tool based on the ABCD ray transfer matrices to model 
cat’s eye retro-reflectors. Compared to commercial ray tracing software packages, our tool 
saves time and costs. The application of this matrix-based 3-D ray tracing method can be 
further extended to other optical components 
The cat’s eye performance, including the retro-reflection efficiency, acceptance angle 
(i.e. field of view, FOV), beam divergence and deviation, is fully studied. Whether a cat’s eye 
structure is optimal or not really depends on its application. For example, when it is used for 
traffic signs, a certain degree of reflected beam divergence is probably needed since the car’s 
headlights and driver are separated by a meter or so. If the cat’s eye is employed in a high-
security/privacy optical ID tag, a limited acceptance angle (i.e. FOV) is preferred to avoid 
any bystander stealing the tag information with a proper light source and detector. This study

are summarized as follows. The PDLC film is 295 μm thick 
while the radius of curvature of reflowed photoresist is 725 
μm and 1102 μm on the front and back units, respectively. The 
ITO-coated glass substrates have a thickness of 700 μm. Fig. 2 
is the top-view photo of the fabricated device.

Figure 2. Device top-view photo. 
III. EXPERIMENTS 
The device operation is demonstrated in Fig. 3. Without any 
applied voltage, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented 
randomly so that light is scattered and, therefore, blocked [Fig. 
3(a)]. When electrodes are fed with voltages, the LC 
molecules in the corresponding regions align with the electric 
field, making the film transparent [Fig. 3(b)]. 
Fig. 4 is the setup for optical testing. A 632.8-nm He-Ne 
laser is used as the light source. The relations of retro-
reflection efficiency vs. incident angle, for both the ON and 
OFF states of a tunable cat’s eye, are shown in Fig. 5. The 
maximum efficiency measured is 9.3% at the ON state, which 
is limited by the photoresist absorption and PDLC 
transparency. Future efforts will focus on increasing the 
efficiency and optimizing the FOV for our need.

IV. CONCLUSION 
We have successfully developed an independently-
addressed micro tunable cat’s eye retro-reflector array. The 
current retro-reflection efficiency is limited to 9.3% by the 
photoresist absorption and PDLC transparency. A dynamic 
image is also demonstrated. The intended use of this device is 
the ID tag in an optical identification system,
