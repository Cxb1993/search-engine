31. INTRODUCTION
Multi-objective programming problems exist almost everywhere, including
environmental facilities [Giannikos, 1998], water resources management [Lee and Wen,
1996], watershed management [Lee and Wen, 1995]. In these problems, one of the challenges
for the decision makers (DMs) is to choose an appropriate alternative among a set of
alternative actions. In the past decade, many techniques have expanded based on
multi-objective programming approaches, such as artificial neural network [Wen and Lee,
1998], fuzzy set theory [Wang and Liang, 2004], game theory [Nishizaki and Sakawa, 2001],
genetic algorithm [Leung and Wang, 2000], grey theory [Hsu and Wen, 2000]. In this study,
we developed a fuzzy game multi-objective optimization model (FGMOM) for economic and
environmental balance in a reservoir watershed.
For the past three decades, there have been lots of studies in literature discussing the
topic of fuzzy games. Butnariu [1978] perhaps first introduced the concept of fuzzy sets in
non-cooperative games. Aubin [1981] discussed cooperative games with fuzzy coalitions.
Nishizaki and Sakawa [1995] developed equilibrium solutions of fuzzy goals for games in
fuzzy and multi-objective environments. Dhingra and Rao [1995] combined cooperative
game theory and fuzzy set theory to yield new cooperative fuzzy games, and further
examined the utility and applicability in an engineering design process. Nishizaki and Sakawa
[2000] formulated a fuzzy cooperative game based on a linear programming problem with
fuzzy parameters for a production problem. Molina and Tejada [2002] analyzed
lexicographical solutions for fuzzy games, and studied their properties and characterization.
Li and Cheng [2002] developed fuzzy multi-objective optimization methods for fuzzy
constrained matrix games. Branzei et al. [2003] studied the cone of convex cooperative fuzzy
games and examined their fuzzy Shapley value. Garagic and Cruz, Jr. [2003] first defined a
new approach to N-person static fuzzy non-cooperative games and developed a solution
concept. Branzei et al. [2004] introduced an egalitarian solution for convex fuzzy games by
adjusting the classical Dutta–Ray algorithm for convex crisp games. Bector et al. [2004] also
proposed fuzzy linear programming models to solve fuzzy matrix games. Peldschus and
Zavadskas [2005] combined fuzzy sets and matrix game theories for multi-criteria
decision-making. They illustrated a case study for selecting the variants water supply systems.
Hwang [2007] introduced two types of “reduced game” to cooperative fuzzy games and
defined the related properties of consistency and converse consistency. Larbani [2009]
surveyed most of the approaches for solving non-cooperative fuzzy games in normal form. In
addition, applications of these games were also discussed. Yu and Zhang [2010] proposed a
generalized form of fuzzy game and extended as a cooperative fuzzy game. They also
provided a practical application for production problem. Chen et al. [2010] formulated a game
framework for strategic behavior of supply chain partners based on fuzzy multi-objective
programming.
To our best knowledge, combined implementation of FGMOM has never been
performed in watershed management in that one needs to balance between economical
development (EcoD) and environmental protection (EnvP). Consequently, this study was
undertaken using a fuzzy game approach to provide the DMs a clear choice in selecting an
appropriate alternative. Results of FGMOM for watershed management may further expand
the application of traditional multi-objective optimization in water resources area. For
comparison, a traditional multi-objective approach was used to contrast the comprehensive
use and robustness from FGMOM analysis.
5μ1(Z1(x)) = h1 (x)
μ2(Z2(x)) = h2 (x)
xk ≥ 0, k = 1, 2, ..., n
or equivalently
Max ν       (7)
s.t.  ν ≤ μ1(Z1(x)),
ν ≤ μ2(Z2(x)),
gj(x) ≤ 0, j = 1, 2, …, m
μ1(Z1(x)) = h1 (x)
μ2(Z2(x)) = h2 (x)
xk ≥ 0, k = 1, 2, ..., n
If all of the membership functions μi(Zi(x)) are linear, the max-min problem becomes a
linear programming problem. Hence, one can obtain an optimal solution by applying the
simplex method of linear programming using LINDO software package [Schrange, 1991]. In
this study, two players represent EnvP and EcoD, respectively. Their payoffs will be identified
as the following process.
Initialy, each player wil not be satisfied with the results from the other player’s 
objective, i.e., FGMOM result for player 1 is far above his/her objective value (i.e., more TP
load than what he/she expects), and the corresponding value for player 2 is way below his/her
goal (i.e., much less that he/she wants). Thus, two players will begin another round of
negotiation and concession. For example, during the second negotiation, each player will then
set his/her objective value very close to initial EnvPgoal and EcoDgoal and see what happens.
As would be expected, each player is still not satisfied after the second negotiated results.
Consequently, a series of concessions and negotiations will be conducted by adjusting
player’s objective values, i.e., player 1 would relax more about his/her environmental concern 
while player 2 lowers the economic income. After further negotiations, difference between the
reset objective values and FGMOM results becomes less divergent. The negotiation process
continues until final solutions of EnvP*, EcoD* can be identified as:
For player 1:
EnvP* ≤ EnvPgoal (8)
And for play 2:
EcoD* ≥ EcoDgoal (9)
Pairs of solution (EnvP*, EcoD*) are called as Nash equilibrium points.
7(free-range chicken farms) as well as community and recreational sites. In this study, the land
uses are classified into major four categories (Table 1).
For each land use type, unit quantity of pollutant (for EnvP) and economic income (for EcoD)
must be known. Since phosphorus is the controlling element for eutrophication, only TP is
used in this study. Export TP values shown in Table 1 were taken from the comprehensive
study conducted by Wen et al. [2005]. Income values from any economic development
associated with respective land use were adopted from Council of Agriculture, Government of
Taiwan [2009]. Two objective functions and constraint set in our study are listed in Table 2.
A membership function for TP impact is shown in Fig. 2(a). The desired TP quantity is
14,200 kg/yr and its mapping membership grade is 1.0. Similarly, the maximum possible
quantity is 26,800 kg/yr and its grade is assigned as zero. Another membership function for
total income in the entire watershed is shown in Fig. 2(b). The maximum income is 394
million USD/yr and its mapping membership grade is 1.0. The minimum possible income
may be 223 million USD/yr and its grade is assigned as zero.

In short, constraint method provides a set of data that analysts identify many solutions. The
solutions are all Pareto optimality, so the quality of solutions is better than that of FGMOM.
But they are possibly difficult for the DMs to select one. FGMOM indicates Nash equilibrium
points that players have focused their goals. After several negotiation attempts, Nash
equilibrium points were obtained. It is easy for the DMs to decide the one balancing EnvP
and EcoD.
