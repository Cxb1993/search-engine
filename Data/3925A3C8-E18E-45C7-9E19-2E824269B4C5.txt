Cell morphology of the nanotube arrays with 
sputtering CaP and heat treatment was faster 
attachment and spreading than as-polished titanium. 
The cell proliferation of the nanotube arrays at 1-14 
days culture was higher than as-polished titanium. 
Consequently, this study indicates that the nanotube 
arrays with sputtering CaP and heat treatment 
exhibited an effect on biological responses.

Introduction 
Titanium and its alloys are widely used in 
orthopedic and dental field due to their appropriate 
mechanical properties, excellent corrosion resistance, 
and biocompatibility compared to other metals such 
as stainless steel [1]. However, titanium and its 
alloys are cannot directly bond to bone because they 
attributed to belong to bio-inert materials. In order to 
improve the biomaterial surface properties, there 
have been many techniques for increasing the 
bioactive and biocompatibility properties such as 
plasma spray [2], surface oxidation [3], passivation 
treatment [4], and micro-arc oxidation [5]. In 
addition, oxide layer on titanium and its alloys 
surface is widely applied to the modifiable method. 
In recent years, the extensive literature interest has 
focused on the creation of nanotube structures of 
oxide ceramics [6,7], especially TiO2 which has a 
wide range of relevant applications such as 
transducer, gas sensors, self-cleaning materials, 
photo catalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells, and 
biomaterials. The different geometrical shapes of 
TiO2 nanotubes are obtained by many techniques 
such as anodization, sol-gel method and chemical 
treatment.  
Among many modifiable techniques, anodization 
is a simple method to fabricate porous titanium oxide 
film at low cost. The nanotube morphologies such as 
pore diameter, wall thickness, tube length, and 
uniformity are influenced on anodization parameters 
including potential, time, and electrolyte 
composition. Gong et al. [8] first reported that high 
ordered TiO2 nanotubes by anodization, using 
aqueous electrolyte containing hydrofluoric acid. 
Moreover, TiO2 nanotubes are useful for improving 
cell functions of osteoblasts including mineralization, 
cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration [9]. 
The apatite formation is considered an essential 
step for direct-to-bone contact ability in a body 
environment. Calcium phosphate (CaP) of 
bioceramics could form a bone-like apatite on 
implant surfaces and improves osseointegration. CaP 
coatings on titanium surface are used in loading 
situations such as total joint replacements and dental 
implants. Several CaP coating methods have been 
investigated including electrolytic deposition [10], 
soaked in simulated body fluids [11], and radio 
frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering [12]. Among 
these coating methods, the RF magnetron sputtering 
technique has been shown a useful for CaP thin films 
deposition [13]. The RF sputtering has many 
advantages such as uniform coatings, excellent 
adhesion between coating and substrate, easy 
controlling coating properties, and a low temperature 
process. Therefore, the biocompatibility of CaP 
bioceramic and mechanical strength of titanium 
implant are combined with this way. 
Although TiO2 nanotubes in physicochemical and 
biological performance and RF sputtered CaP 
coatings on titanium surface have been studied 
[14-17], it was seldom reported that CaP were coated 
on nanotube arrays by RF sputtering. The aim of this 
study is to prepare nanotube arrays coated with CaP 
bioceramics by RF sputtering. The phase, thickness, 
and surface morphology of nanotubes coated with 
CaP were evaluated and their temperature stability as 
well as structural and morphological transformations 
via annealing up to 500°C in free-oxygen 
environment was investigated. Besides, the 
biological properties were evaluated by in vitro tests, 
in term of the cell morphology and cell proliferation. 
 
Materials and methods 
2.1. Fabrication of nanotube arrays 
The self-organized titanium oxide nanotube 
arrays were prepared by anodization. Each specimen 
of the titanium substrates (ASTM F-67) was 12.7 
mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness. The samples 
were mechanically ground by silicon paper from 
320-, 400-, 600-, 800-, 1000-, 1200-, and 1500-grit 
culture, the proliferation rate of cells was determined 
by methylthiazoletetrazolium (MTT) assay. Each 
well was added the 200 L MTT working solution. 
After 4 h incubation, the MTT working solution was 
removed and the insoluble formazan crystal was 
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The total 
solution of 100 L from each well was aspirated and 
poured into a 96-well plate for measurement by 
ELISA reader (Sunrise-Basic, Tecan, Austria) at 570 
nm. 
 
2.6 Cell morphology 
The specimen surfaces were seed with cells in a 
density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2. After 3h and 12 h, cells 
were pre-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min 
at 4°C, and then the specimens were washed three 
times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The 
cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 for 1 h, and then 
were washed three times with PBS. After fixation, 
the specimens were dehydrated in increasing 
concentrations of ethanol (from 30, 50, 70, 95, to 
100%), followed by critical-point-dried with 
hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for 10 min. The 
specimens were sputter-coated with gold, and 
observed by SEM. 
 
2.7 Statistical analysis 
The one-way ANOVA is employed to test the 
significance of treatment effects on cell proliferation, 
where the ANOVA is implemented using Statistics 
Package for Social Science (SPSS). Results are 
depicted as the mean ± standard deviation. A p-value 
of less than 0.05 is regarded as being statistically 
significant. Duncan tests are carried out to group 
treatments for effects that are determined by 
ANOVA as significant. 
 
Results and discussion 
Current implant uses alumina, titanium and it 
alloys such as commercial pure titanium and 
Ti-6Al-4V as implant materials. The present study, 
which utilized sputtering to coat CaP on nanotube 
arrays, investigated characteristics of TiO2 nanotube 
arrays, and adhesion and proliferation of HOS cells. 
Figure 1(a) showed the microstructures of the 
nanotube arrays surface by SEM observation. The 
three-dimensional structures with open pores were 
observed on the specimen. The surface of titanium 
was smooth before anodized process, but became 
porous when the anodized occurred at a constant 
applied voltage. As shown in Figure 1(a), the inner 
diameter of the nanotube arrays was 29 nm, which 
was grown on titanium surface at potentials of 10 V. 
The cross-section morphologies of the nanotube 
arrays were observed by DB-FIB. As shown in 
Figure 1(b), the lengths of nanotubes was 170 nm for 
applied voltages at 10 V. Gong et al. [8] was first to 
synthesize TiO2 nanotube arrays of up to 500 nm 
length by titanium anodized in a HF aqueous 
electrolyte. The pore size of nanotubes was 
controlled with various applied voltages. It was 
indicated that the nanotube length and tube inner 
diameters of tube were increasing with increasing 
applied voltage.

Depending on the anodic conditions, including 
electrolyte composition, time duration and applied 
voltage, different types of anodic behavior have been 
observed for titanium such as pitting corrosion, 
uniform corrosion, self-passivation, and film 
formation. Therefore, many studies reported that 
electrolytes were adjusted to fabricate different

of amorphous titanium oxide [25]. Because the CaP 
peak was not detected, the CaP was the amorphous 
phase. After heat treatment, the new diffraction 
peaks were not identified. It indicated that the 
nanotube length was too short to transform phase, 
which nanotube arrays were amorphous phase. The 
vacuum heat condition was the other factor. The 
amorphous TiO2 nanotube arrays transformed to 
crystalline TiO2 with heat treatment in oxygen [24].

The chemical states of Ca and P were further 
investigated using ESCA analysis and the spectra 
were shown in Figure 5. The broad-range ESCA 
spectra of sputtering CaP on nanotube arrays with 
vacuum heating treatment are shown in Figure 5(a). 
The major surface constituents observed on surface 
of nanotube arrays are Ti, O, Ca, P, and C. The 
relative atomic concentration of calcium and 
phosphorus revealed 14.91 and 12.84 at.% for 
specimen, respectively. As shown in Figure 5(b), the 
presence of P is observed on the specimen by the P 
2p3 peak at binding energy of 133.7 eV, 
corresponding to hypophosphite (P+) or phosphate 
(P5+) [26]. The Ca 2p spectra exhibited an expected 
doublet feature of Ca 2p1 peak at binding energy of 
351.4 eV and Ca 2p3 peak at binding energy of 
347.8 eV, as shown in Figure 5(c). The Ca peak 
positions correspond to the oxidized form of Ca2+ in 
the inorganic calcium oxygen compounds [27]. The 
P 2p and Ca 2p peaks of spectra are shifting slightly 
toward the higher binding energy side. It indicated 
that Ca and P in the specimens exist as a divalent ion 
and a phosphate, respectively, which the products of 
calcium phosphate compounds are expected [26]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. (a) Broad-range ESCA spectra of specimen 
of sputtering CaP with heat treatment, (b) The 
morphology with many lamellipodia and filopodia 
extensions from cell to the substrate. As shown in 
Figure 7(e,f), cells flattened are excellent for the 
nanotube arrays with sputtering CaP and heat 
tretment. Although the specimen of nanotube arrays 
with sputtering CaP and heat treatment showed high 
contact angle, as shown in Figure 6(d), the specimen 
exhibited the excellent cell attachment compared to 
as-polished titanium surface. It indicated that the 
specimen of nanotube arrays with sputtering CaP and 
heat treatment showed the better initial cell 
attachment. The nanotube surface showed the 
excellent cell adhesion, and an abundant amount of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) between the neighboring 
cells were observed with filopodia extensions [21]. 
Besides, Popat et al. [30] reported that cells are able 
to spread faster on nanotube surface compared to 
as-polished titanium surface and anchor themselves 
to the nanotube structure. These results demonstrated 
that the structure of nanotube arrays was the main 
factor to influence cell attachment. 
Park et al. [9] indicated that cell adhesion, 
spreading, proliferation, and differentiation were 
critically dependent on the tube diameter. A diameter 
less than 30 nm accelerated integrin clustering 
contact formation and enhanced cell activities 
compared to smooth surfaces. Besides, the research 
studies showed that the sputtering CaP on titanium 
was a great benefit to enhance cell behavior [31,32]. 
The MTT assay was used to determine cell 
proliferation rate on nanotube arrays. Figure 8(a) 
shows the effect of the nanotube arrays on the 
viability of HOS cells after culturing for 1, 7 and 14 
days, respectively. The increases in cell number were 
found for all kinds of specimens from 1 to 14 days. 
The significant increase in cell numbers as function 
of time was observed in nanotube arrays, and 
nanotube arrays with sputtering CaP and heat 
treatment throughout 1-14 day culture period 
(p<0.05). After 1-day, 7-day, and 14-day culture, cell 
numbers on nanotube arrays and nanotube arrays 
with sputtering CaP and heat treatment are higher 
than as-polished titanium (p<0.05), but there is no 
significant difference found among two kinds of 
nanotube arrays. The bold line beneath indicates that 
the difference in cell number is statistically 
insignificant, as shown in Figure 8(b), (c) and (d). 
The nanotube arrays surface supported higher cell 
adhesion, proliferation and viability up to 14 days of 
culture when compared to as-polished titanium 
surface. There are many studies reported that 
nanotube arrays provided a template for the cell 
adhesion and proliferation [30,33,34]. The other 
study exhibited that the smaller diameter of nanotube 
showed the better cell behavior [35]. Their results 
are consistent with the present study. 
Although the specimen of nanotube arrays with 
sputtering CaP and heat treatment were not the best 
behavior on the proliferation rate, it still showed the 
excellent cell proliferation. The calcium phosphate 
coated on titanium by RF magnetron sputtering 
could improve the biocompatibility of titanium with 
bone tissue and exhibited the high percentage of 
bone-implant contact in vivo [36]. The other factor is 
surface composition. The element of fluorine exists 
in the structure of nanotube arrays. Liu et al. 
indicated that the fluoride ions were implanted into 
the smooth titanium by plasma immersion ion 
implantation technique [37]. The results showed that 
the cells on the fluoride-ion-implanted titanium 
exhibited the better morphologies, attachment, and 
proliferation than that of the non-implanted titanium. 
In this investigation, the nanotube arrays with 
sputtering CaP and heat treatment provides an 
excellent template for cell adhesion and proliferation. 
The cells showed the faster spreading and growth 
than as-polished titanium. Because titanium and it 
alloys are widely used in dental and orthopedic 
implant, these insights would be beneficial to the 
biomaterials designs by anodization technique.
