Abstract
In this study we have developed an environmental-friendly process to make the
low-cost and high strength biodegradable plastics that are either for plate-molded or
blow-film types of products. The experimental factors include the level of plasticizer,
addition of enforcer and type of starch in a bio-catalytic extrusion process. The results
show that the mechanical properties of biodegradable plastics will remain unchanged
when the level of plasticizer was in the range of 19-25%, and higher level (> 34%) of
plasticizer will reduce the strength of plastics. The proper level of CaO enforcer will
increase the strength of plastics. It was found that 1% of enforcer resulted in the high
tensile strength of 7.2 0.7 MPa, meanwhile the maximum elongation of 969 119
% was reached at 1.5 % of enforcer level in the plastics. The selection of corn starch
was proven as the best starch in the enzymatic hydrolytic extrusion process to reach a
best mechanical properties of plastics with tensile strength of 12.3 0.2 MPa,
Young’s modulus of 1817.9 MPa, and toughness of 26.66.0 MPa. The extrudates
with best ingredient were blown to film of 0.04 mm thickness, and shown a tensile
Enzyme was obtained from Novozyme (Switzerland). Polyester was obtained from
Hong-Qi Co., (Taiwan.). Deionized water was used to adjust moisture content during
extrusion.
2.2. Preparation of biodegradable composites and Extrusion
The composite included polyester, different level of plasticizer, enforcer and
various type of starch. Different ingredients were added simultaneously in a high
speed mixer. The basic composition in plastic samples was shown in Table 1.
Compounding of biodegradable composites was proceeded in a single-screw extruder.
The processing of single-screw extruder was shown in Figure 1. Temperatures of four
segments in the extruder barrel were about 120ºC, 125ºC, 125ºC and 120ºC. The
extruder screw speed was set at 40 rpm for this processing.

2.3 Blown-film processing
The resin pellets was fed into blown film extruder. Temperature at different zones
of extruder was set from 120 to 125ºC. The screw speed was set at 50 rpm. The
blown-film processing was shown in Figure 2.
2.4 Test of mechanical properties of the plate-molded and blown-film plastics
The mechanical properties of the blends were evaluated by tensile testing.
Dumbbell-shaped specimens were prepared by stamping the plastic sample on a
standard shape in accordance with the regulation of ASTM D638-Type IV. The
tensile test was performed at a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min, using an initial gauge
length of 25 mm. Tensile strength, elongation, Young’s modulus and toughness of
each specimen were measured and averaged from three tests. The mechanical
properties of blow-film were measured according to ASTM D882.

3.2 The mechanical properties of biodegradable plastic with various types of
enforcer
The application of enforcers in the plastic sample was shown in Table 3. Calcium
oxide shows a good property of strength enforcement. 1% calcium oxide resulted in
the best tensile strength (7.2MPa) and also high modulus. But 1.5% content gave a
best toughness (55.4MPa).

enforcer
3.3 The mechanical properties of biodegradable plastics with different starch.
Due to the different amylose content in various starches, it is worth to study the
effect of type of starch on the mechanical properties of plastic samples. As data in
Table 4, corn starch shown a best tensile strength (12.3MPa) , the best elongation
(281.3%), best modulus (180.8 MPa) and also toughness(26.6 MPa). Therefore, the
blown-film samples were based on the corn starch and also with best enforcer.
3.5 Biodegradation test of plastic sample
The test for our sample’s biodegradability followed the regulation of ISO14855
method. The result showed that the film’s biodegradability could reach 100% in 89
days. One sample film has passed EN 13432 and ASTM norm D6400-04 tests
conducted by Organic Waste System laboratory, GLP laboratory certified by the
European Union, and obtained certification of `OK COMPOST’,`DIN CERTCO’of 
the EU, `COMPOSTABLE’of the USA, and `Greenpla’ of the Japan.
4 Conclusion
In this study we developed a biocatalytic extrusion process to manufacture the
inexpensive high-strength biodegradable plastics. It is found that the addition of 25%
plasticizer resulted in the increase of tensile strength. Calcium oxide shown a good
property as a enforcer, and the optimum content of calcium oxide was 1% ~ 1.5%
that resulted in a tensile strength of 7.20.7 MPa and elongation at 969.3%. We
found that different starch resulted in different mechanical properties of
biodegradable plastics. Corn starch shows as a best starch for the high strength and
also for the high toughness of samples. The blown-film sample of thickness of 0.04
mm shown a tensile strength of 22.52 MPa that is similar to a commercial
polyethylene film (tensile strength of 22.48 MPa) with same thickness. Therefore we
have developed a biodegradable plastic of commercial potential.
