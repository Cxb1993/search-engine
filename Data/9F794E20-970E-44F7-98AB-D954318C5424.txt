(a) 磁性自旋結構與微波信號激勵的關係 
It has been known that the spin transfer between spin-polarized current and a 
spin procession is executed via spin angular torques. As can be seen in Fig. 1, 
the spin-polarized current is generated by ferromagnetic conductors and coupled 
to the spin procession in neighboring ferromagnetic conductors. The typical 
heterostructure is composed of ferromagnet/normal metal/ ferromagnet (F/N/F) 
that was reported for Co/Cu/Co etc. [4]. Under such a magnetic system, the 
magnetic films is shown in Fig. 4.

this topic, a quasi-mixer that is required in the heterodyne technique will be 
developed by layers in the spin system. Because the low frequency AC signal is 
close to the DC current and can enlarge the frequency bandwidth between the 
neighboring output signal, in this research the AC signal is to replace the DC 
bias that is widely used in studying the microwave oscillation generated by 
spin-polarized current. Through the analysis of selective spin wave that is pick 
up by heterodyne technique, the relation of microwave oscillation and structure 
arrangement, magnetic properties etc., can be built in this research.

(c) 改善磁性自旋結構對微波信號激勵的效率 
More advanced applications of the microwave oscillators based on multilayered 
magnetic films will be processed by stacking well-control amplify units in layer 
structures. As shown in Fig. 6, several amplified stages are cascaded in structure 
with an in-phase feed back control. In this research, based on the experience and 
When a spin-polarized current is injected into a ferromagnetic material, the 
background magnetization receives a spin torque. The past investigations have 
found that the current-induced spin torque has many unique properties. Among 
them, several investigations demonstrate, by explicitly solving the modified 
Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equation, that the spin torque distorts domain 
structures, drives domain walls out of equilibrium, makes magnetization 
switching from one direction to another, and creates spin excitations. However, 
the poor understanding the details of effect of layered interface, the multimode 
excitation and structures have limited for their application for high and 
broadband excitation with high output microwave power. For this research, the 
expected achievement is  
(a) Find out the more detailed relation of dc bias, spin polarized current, 
spin torque and spin flip in magnetic spin system. 
(b) Base on the knowledge and experience in (a), magnetic spin system 
with low dc current density and high output microwave power is 
expected to be obtained. 
(c) Most long range microwave systems utilize a cascaded solid 
oscillators (e.g. YIG) to be a microwave source for communication 
system. With the requirements for integrated circuits on chips today, 
the microwave oscillator based on spin polarized current in 
multilayered magnetic thin film plays an important role of reforming 
traditional microwave source to be easy tunable and simple printed on 
circuits. Of course, the physics of the spin system should be studied in 
order to the more advanced applications. This is what this research 
proposal is expected to be.

properties that drew more attention in scientific interests and engineering applications recently, because 
FMR effect reveals the spin behaviours through the microwave signals. This is attractive to scientific 
studies such as magnetic exchange bias, reversal, anisotropy et. al. in exploring the spin dynamics [1]-
[3].  The FMR signal that was located at the band of microwave also attracted more applications on 
microwave devices [1][2]. For a number of the FMR studies, a 3dB linewidth of the FMR signal is an 
important indicator of the microwave loss properties and spin damping behaviour. There are two 
different types of FMR linewidth measurement. Namely, field linewidth and frequency linewidth. The 
Field-linewidth measurement is a method that holds the frequency and scans over the external magnetic 
field. The linewidth HΔ  for a given frequency f  is then obtained at 3dB bandwidth, namely, FWHM 
from a magnetic field profile. 
 
Except Recently, narrowing the increasing demanding of advanced wireless technologies that needed a 
high quality bandstop filter operated at a narrow bandwith with tunability has made the requirement of 
the narrowing FMR signal [4][5]. This article has attracted high quality Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) 
materials possessing a high Q value over a broad-band frequency range make it to be widely used for 
various microwave components including magnetic filters, tunable oscillators and phase shifters etc., for 
years. Recently, miniature mobile systems such as cell phone become popular in the market. Including 
the widely-used YIG devices, multilayer ceramic microwave devices have attracted extensive attention 
because of the feasibility of integrating multi-functional communication devices in chips. However, from 
the past experience, YIG garnet is hardly used in multilayer communication chip, due to the sintering 
temperature is up to 1400oC that is higher than the melting temperature of most conductive metals. Bi-
substituted YIG garnet has been known as the relevant ceramic materials that the sintering temperature is 
much lower than of pure YIG polycrystalline ceramics. In this study, the BixY3-xFe5O12 (x=0.25~1.00) 
was prepared by the sol-gel method and sintered at 1200 ~900oC for 2 hours. The prepared samples are 
examined by the XRD for observing their phase formulation. The successful samples are then measured 
their ferromagnetic resonant signals at microwave frequencies. The results show that the FMR properties 
are similar to all samples. However, the FMR absorption magnitude is improved by the bismuth 
substitution.  
 
2 Sample preparation 
YIG:Bi having a stoichiometric composition of BixY3-xFe5O12, where x=0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.00 were 
prepared by the sol-gel method. In order to obtain a uniform and successful substitution of Bismuth to 
Yttrium in YIG structure, a coprecipitation method was proceed by mixing the raw solutions, 
Y(NO3)3‧6H2O, Bi(NO3)3‧5H2O and Fe(NO3)3‧9H2O. The nearly atom-level mixing provides a 
uniform and high-quality power that was calcined in the air at 700oC for 2 hours and then milled again 
for 1 hours. The resulting power was pressed as a disk with 3000N/m2 and sintered in the air for 1200oC 
(for x=0.25), 1150oC (for x=0.5), 1050oC (for x=0.75), 900oC (for x=1), respectively, in the air for 2 
hours. All the samples have had at least 85% of theoretical density. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of 
successful samples for various Bismuth contents. It is found that the main peak (420) is shifted to lower 
diffractive angles while increasing the Bismuth contents in the YIG garnet. From the XRD patterns,Bi-
substituted YIG samples form a garnet phase at 900oC except the sample with x=1.00 Bismuth 
substitution. This data shows that the Bismuth successfully replace the Yttrium position in the YIG 
structure.

FMR signal for four different Bismuth substitution. Of interest is that the plot demonstrates the similar 
FMR responses whatever the different Bismuth substitution. Comparing with the theory calculation 
( 2.8 /MHz Oeγ =  and 4 1750Ms Oeπ = ), even the Bismuth substitution for yitrium is up to 1.00, 
YIG garnet does not change the spin-procession behavior that responses to the ferromagnetic resonance.

4 FMR absorption strength 
However, comparing the absorption strength in four samples, the absorption strength is improved by 
bismuth substitution in YIG. As can be seen in FMR absorption signal shown in figure 2(a), the second 
absorption magnitude is around -8dB. The absorption in the same position is down to -11dB in figure 2(b) 
and becomes deep and shape in figure 2(c) and (d). Figure 3(b) shows the FMR absorption strength in 
linear regression. As can be seen, the FMR absorption is stronger for the 0.5 Bismuth substitution in YIG 
and becomes sharper for  the substitution is more than 0.75. The shaper absorption signal provides a 
narrow linewidth (3dB@half-power linewidth) in FMR spectrum. The absorption linewidth can be 
regarded as the result of relaxation behaviour of the spin procession process that is induced by 
microwave and back to the equivalent position. The FMR linewidth is a measurement of the microwave 
loss properties of the spin system. It is theoretically described by a damping parameter α  and 
characterized by FMR measurement[1][2]. Sangita and co-workers have found thatα  is approximated by
