英文摘要 
Diagnosis for systematic defects is very 
critical for yield learning in nanometer 
technology.  We propose a bridging fault 
diagnosis which identifies a single layer of 
systematic defects (LSD), where more than 
expected numbers of bridging faults are located.  
The proposed technique utilizes lithography 
simulator to simulate printed image then extracts 
hotspot locations of short defects from the image.  
The extracted hotspot locations are utilized to 
improve diagnosis resolution.  Instead of 
treating each failing CUT independently, a 
statistical method (Z-test) is applied to diagnose 
all CUTs simultaneously.  Experiments on six 
of seven large ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits 
successfully diagnose LSD for single bridging 
fault as well as multiple bridging faults.

2. INTRODUCTION 
In nanometer technologies, systematic 
defects have become a more challenging issue 
than random defects [1].  Recent case studies 
from the industry also demonstrated the 
importance of diagnosis for systematic defects 
[2].  Test and yield learning is ranked as the 
number one difficult challenge in the 2007 
edition of International Technology Roadmap for 
Semiconductor [3]. Therefore, diagnosis for 
systematic defects is very critical for yield 
improvement and quality control.   
Traditionally, memories and test structures 
are used to identify process-induced systematic 
defects during the yield ramp-up stage [4].  
However, memories do not utilize all layers and 
all layout scenarios so recent research suggests 
that logic diagnosis also provides important 
information for yield learning [5].  Logic 
diagnosis is especially helpful to identify a single 
dominant failure mechanism when yield 
excursion happens [6].   
In deep-submicron technology (below 
40nm process nodes), lithography has become a 
more and more important issue.  Because for 
the 40nm and below process nodes, Optical 
Proximity Correlation (OPC) and design rules 
are not sufficient to generate a 
manufacturing-friendly design due to design 
complexity and the continuing usage of 193nm 
light source [7].  The figure below shows an 
example of a lithography hotspot location of a 
short defect that cannot be identified by DRC 
rule checking.   
 
match means that, for each failing pattern, the 
observed failing outputs and the simulation 
failing outputs are exactly the same.  A 
bridging pair of two nets A and G in layer L1 is 
denoted as <A, G>@L1.  A fault is involved in 
a bridging pair if the fault is on one net of the 
bridging pair.  For example, A stuck-at one 
fault (A sa1) is involved in the bridging pair <A, 
G>. 
A naïve diagnosis tries to cover as many 
SLAT patterns as possible.  For the example of 
CUT#1, A sa0 fault is first chosen, followed by 
B sa1 fault.  Similarly, CUT#2 is diagnosed of 
the F stuck-at 0 fault.  The statistical data of 
these diagnosis results seem to be physically 
uncorrelated:  net A goes through L1/L2, net B 
and net F goes through layers L1/L2/L3.  The 
bridging pair <A, G> is located in L1, bridging 
pair <B, C> is in L3, and bridging pair <F, H> is 
in L2.  Although the naïve diagnosis covers all 
the SLAT patterns for each CUT, it provides 
little physical correlation about the defects. 
TABLE 3.  DIAGNOSIS EXAMPLE

<E, G>@L3 
H sa1 X  X    1,2 <F, H>@L2 
CUT#1 X X X X X  - - 
CUT#2 X X  X  X - - 
  
Instead of treating each CUT independently, 
our proposed technique tries to find an optimal 
cover for two CUTs altogether.  In this example, 
for CUT#1, the bridging pair <B, C> in L3 
covers all the SLAT patterns.  For CUT#2, the 
bridging pairs <B, C> and <D, E> in L3 cover all 
SLAT patterns.  Considering two CUTs 
together, L3 is diagnosed as the LSD.  Please 
note that there are two simulation failing patterns 
(P3 and P5) that do not completely match the 
observed failure of CUT#2.  This could be 
caused by multiple defects or the Byzantine 
General effect [8]. 
4. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE 
4.1 Overall Diagnosis Flow 
Figure 2 illustrates the overall flow of the 
proposed diagnosis technique.  There are four 
input files of the technique: layout in the DEF 
format, test patterns, netlist, and observed 
failures of CUTs.  First of all, Litho-aware 
Bridging Pair Extraction (LA-BPE) is 
performed to extract litho-aware physically 
adjacent bridging pairs from the layout.  The 
details about LA-BPE can be found in section 
4.2.  After that, a stuck-at fault dictionary is 
built, followed by a structure analysis for each 
CUT.  The details about this step can be found 
in section 4.3.  Layer oriented covering, which 
is the core of this technique, is then performed 
for each layer of each CUT.  The details are 
described in section 4.4.  Finally, after all CUTs 
are processed, the statistical analysis is 
performed to determine if there exists any LSD.  
The details about the statistical analysis are 
described in section 4.5 
 
Figure 2.  Overall Diagnosis Flow 
4.2 Litho-aware Bridging Pair Extraction 
Figure 3 illustrates the overall flow of 
Litho-aware Bridging Pair Extraction (LA-BPE).  
This technique consists of two parts.  The first 
part is a lithography simulation process to obtain 
lithography hotspot region and the second part is 
a net mapping process to report the extracted 
bridging pairs. 
 
where OP(Pi) represents the set of failing 
observed points for failing pattern Pi.  Ck is a 
backtrace cone from an observed point Ok.  Ii,j 
is the intersection of cones from all OP(Pi) 
which belong to DSj.  ICL is obtained by taking 
union of all Ii,j for all patterns and all disjoint 
sets. 
Figure 5 (a) shows an example circuit to 
demonstrate our structure analysis technique.  
There are three culprit faults located on 
candidates F1, F2, and F3 in the circuit.  
TABLE I shows the test failures of those culprit 
faults.  Each ‘X’ in the table indicates a failure 
observed at the observed point (column) by 
applying the test pattern (row).  In this example, 
all six outputs: {O1~O6} in the circuit are failing 
observed points.  Figure 5(b) shows the 
corresponding observed point graph, which 
consists of six nodes: {O1~O6} and five edges 
{O1O2, O3O4, O4O5, O4O6, O5O6}.  Two 
disjoint sets DS1: {O1, O2} and DS2: {O3, O4, O5, 
O6} are identified in the graph.  TABLE II 
summarizes the results of our structure analysis.  
Take the first row of TABLE II as an example, 
there are two observed points, O1 and O2, both 
belong to DS1.  Therefore I1,1: {A, B, F1} for 
test pattern P1 is acquired by taking the 
intersection of backtrace cones: C1 and C2.  For 
the second row of TABLE II, observed points: 
O1 and O2 belong to DS1 whereas observed 
points: O3 and O4 belong to DS2.  Therefore I2,1: 
{A, B, F1} and I2,2: {C, D, F2} for test pattern P2 
are acquired by taking intersection of backtrace 
cones: {C1, C2} and {C3, C4} respectively.  The 
last row in the table shows ICL of our structure 
analysis: {A, B, F1, C, D, F2, E, H, F3} which is 
much better than the ICLs obtained by the other 
two approaches.  The aggressive approach 
obtains an empty ICL by taking the intersection 
of backtrace cones of C1 to C6.  The 
conservative approach, which takes the union of 
backtrace cones of C1 to C6, obtains an ICL 
consisted of all twenty-six candidates.

4.4 Layer-oriented Covering  
Figure 6 illustrates the overall flow of 
layer-oriented covering.  In this flow, one 
single layer (the layer under diagnosis) is chosen 
at a time.  The SLAT patterns of this layer 
under diagnosis are selected.  Then SLAT 
pattern covering is performed followed by 
equivalent fault class (EFC) covering.  The 
results of layer-oriented covering are the number 
of SLAT patterns and the number of involved 
bridging pairs for each layer under diagnosis. 
A similar greedy algorithm is implemented 
for EFC covering.  This algorithm first selects 
essential bridging pairs, followed by greedily 
selects the bridging pairs which cover the most 
uncovered EFCs.  In Table 7, an essential 
bridging pair <B, C>, which covers both EFC1 
and EFC2, is selected.

4.5 Statistical Analysis  
4.5.1 Defect Probability 
For each layer under diagnosis, a diagnostic 
score is calculated based on the number of 
SLAT patterns and the number of bridging pairs 
selected by EFC covering.  The diagnostic 
score of layer Li (DiagScoreLi) is defined as:  
⎩⎨
⎧=
coverd are patterns SLAT all If
 in pairs bridgingby Li
Li
Li 
NBP
DiagScore  
Otherwise  
1
0                
 
 
where NBPLi denotes the number of bridging 
pairs selected in EFC covering for layer Li.  The 
diagnostic score is between zero and one.  The 
higher the diagnostic score is, the more likely the 
culprit bridging fault is located in layer Li.  
Although the diagnostic score is an artificial 
function, it is defined based on the following two 
observations.  First, LSD is very likely to cover 
all SLAT patterns in the test set (but not vice 
versa).  Second, LSD usually has a covering of 
fewer bridging pairs than the other layers. 
The defect probability represents the relative 
likelihood of each layer where the culprit 
bridging fault is located.  The defect probability 
of layer Li (DPLi) is calculated by the diagnostic 
score of Li divided by the summation of 
diagnostic scores of all layers.

Table 8 shows the diagnostic score and the 
defect probability for each layer of CUT#1.  
The diagnostic scores are zeros for L1 and L2 
because they cannot explain all five SLAT 
patterns (P1-P5); only L3 can explain all SLAT 
patterns.  L3 has only one bridging pair, <B, C>.  
Hence, the diagnostic scores of L3 is one and the 
defective layer probability of L3 is also one.

L2 3 1 0 0.0 
L3 5 1 1 1.0 
4.5.2 Z-test 
Having the defect probability from all 
CUTs, a Z-test is now performed to determine 
whether a particular layer has defect probability 
higher than its expected value.  The Z-test is a 
useful analysis for statistical data of normal 
distribution [10].  In a Z-test, the null 
hypothesis assumes that the sample data follow a 
baseline normal distribution.  A Z-score is 
calculated based on the mean and standard 
deviation of the sample data.  If the Z-score is 
higher than a threshold, then the null hypothesis 
can be rejected with a very high confidence. 
The Z-score of layer Li, denoted by ZLi, 
represents the distance between the sample mean 
and the mean of baseline normal distribution 
expressed in standard deviation unit.  The 
formula for computing ZLi is 
n
DP
i
ii
L
LL
σ
μZ Li
−=  
where μLi denotes the mean of baseline 
distribution of layer Li.  σLi is the population 
standard deviation, which can be approached by 
the sample standard deviation when the sample 
size (n) is large enough.  
As shown in Figure 7, Zα denotes the 
Z-score of a predefined significance level α.  If 
ZLi > Zα, then the null hypothesis is rejected with 
confidence level 1-α.  For example, suppose 
increases to 58 and the new results now are 
much better than before ⎯ only two false 
positives and the other diagnosis are correct.  
This experiment shows that the quality of test 
patterns do have significant impact on the 
diagnosis results. 
6. MULTIPLE BRIDGING FAULTS 
The ability to diagnose multiple bridging 
faults is important for systematic defects because 
there could be many defects clustered on the 
same die [11].  The proposed technique can be 
easily changed to diagnose multiple bridging 
faults with the following modifications.   
First of all, removal of candidate stuck-at 
faults in Sec. 4.4.1 is now delayed until all 
SLAT patterns are selected.  Because the 
observed failing outputs may result from 
different bridging faults, not all bridging pairs 
are excited by all failing patterns.  We make an 
assumption that only one culprit bridging fault is 
responsible for one row in the covering table.  
Hence, for each row in the table, the EFC must 
be involved in at least one bridging pair that is 
excited by all SLAT patterns in that row.  If not, 
the row is removed.  Take Table 12 as an 
example.  If bridging pair <D, E> is not excited 
by P4, then the third row EFC3 is removed.   
TABLE 12.  SLAT  PATTERN  COVERING   TABLE (L3 OF CUT #2) 
EFC P1 P2 P4 P6 
EFC1 (B sa1)   X  
EFC2 (C sa0) X X   
EFC3 (D sa0)   X  
EFC4 (E sa1)    X 
 
Second, removing bridging pairs for EFC 
covering in Sec. 4.4.3 also needs to be changed.  
We assume that multiple bridging faults are 
independent.  Hence, for each row in the table, 
the bridging pair must be excited by all SLAT 
patterns explained by the candidate stuck-at 
faults that are involved in the bridging pair.  
Take Table 13 as an example, <E, G> is 
removed if it is not excited by P6.   
TABLE 13.   EFC  COVERING  TABLE   (L3 OF CUT #2) 
Bridging Pair EFC1 (B sa1) EFC2 (C sa0) EFC3 (E sa1)
<B, C> X X  
<D, E>   X 
<E, G>   X 
 
Table 14 shows the experimental results of 
multiple bridging faults.  The observed failures 
were generated by fault simulation of one to 
three random bridging faults.   The test 
patterns applied were the three-detect SSF 
patterns.  All circuits except s35932 were 
successfully diagnosed of five LSD.  To 
improve the diagnosis results, a five-detect SSF 
test set generated by a commercial tool was 
applied on s35932 again.  The results of new 
test patterns (n5_s35932) are shown in the last 
row of Table 14. 
7. CONCLUSION 
A bridging fault diagnosis technique is 
proposed to identify LSD for yield learning.  A 
fault dictionary is built, followed by a 
layer-oriented covering technique.  The Z-test 
is then performed to diagnose LSD for all CUTs 
simultaneously.  Both single bridging fault and 
multiple bridging faults experiments on 300 
CUTs of seven ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits 
are performed. The experiments successfully 
diagnosed most LSD for single bridging faults as 
well as multiple bridging faults.  It is also 
shown that N-detect test patterns help to improve 
the diagnosis results
