two limitations. First, some of the patient’s clinical signs 
(such as results of BMD tests [13], [16], or other inva-
sive and laboratory measurements [12]-[16]) on which 
the systems rely for deducing diagnostic conclusions are 
difficult to be acquired outside hospitals or laboratory 
environments. As mentioned above, this not only de-
creases the accessibility of the systems to the general 
public, but also increases the cost of diagnosing osteo-
porosis such that mass screening using such systems is 
practically infeasible. Second, during construction 
process, some of the systems need a great amount of 
consultation with medical experts [16], [17]. This in-
volves the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge from 
experts. In many medical domains, however, this 
knowledge may be incomplete, since the relationship 
between clinical signs and medical meanings are not 
always transparent — osteoporosis diagnosis is exactly 
the case.  
To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, in this 
paper, we propose a novel learning-driven system — 
Intelligent Medical Diagnostic System (IMDS) acces-
sible through web interface — for performing on-line 
initial screening for osteoporosis. The fundamentals of 
the IMDS are mainly based on the well-known theory of 
fuzzy-neural networks (FNNs). FNNs possess the abil-
ity to automatically learn useful knowledge from 
available examples without the active participation of 
domain experts during the process of constructing sys-
tem, and can exhibit superiority over other conventional 
technologies (e.g. statistical techniques and regression 
analyses) due to its superior nonlinear modeling capa-
bility. Through the internet, users simply answer a series 
of directed questions to the IMDS, and then they will 
immediately receive the results of osteoporosis risk as-
sessment. According to the results of clinical testing, it 
is shown that the proposed system does provide the 
general public or even health care providers with a 
convenient, reliable alternative to the assessment of 
BMD and to the risk assessment of osteoporosis.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces a new four-layered FNN and then 
explains its role in medical diagnosis. The architecture 
of the IMDS and the proposed learning algorithm are 
described in Section III. In Section IV, we use a BMD 
database to construct the IMDS, and then evaluate its 
performance in osteoporosis risk assessment. Finally, 
Section V concludes the paper. 
II. FUZZY-NEURAL NETWORK 
A diagnostic process can be formalized by evaluating 
available clinical signs (information drawn from the 
patient’s history and from clinical and laboratory find-
ings) and then deducing appropriate conclusions ac-
cording to a set of diagnostic rules which describe the 
relationship between signs and diseases [16]. Diagnosis 
work can essentially be regarded as a classification task; 
in other words, a diagnostic system is practically 
equivalent to a classifier.  
It is well known that FNNs possess the ability to 
automatically acquire useful knowledge from a large 
number of examples, and can exhibit superior nonlinear 
modeling capability in many fields such as pattern clas-
sification, object recognition, model prediction, and 
system identification. A FNN is named by the fact that a 
fuzzy model described by if-then rules and inference 
mechanisms can completely be transformed into a 
multi- layered artificial neural network (MNN) com-
posed of neurons and connecting links as long as each 
neuron in a MNN performs a corresponding function in 
a fuzzy model, for example, fuzzification, intersection, 
union, and defuzzification. This fact makes standard 
gradient learning methods in MNNs available to adjust 
the parameters of FNNs [18], [19], and further facili-
tates the design of learning algorithms for FNNs. In this 
paper, therefore, we employ a FNN classifier as the 
kernel of the IMDS to perform the diagnosis works.  
It is worth noting that differing from conventional 
complicated five-layered FNNs, a new four-layered one 
is proposed here so that we can construct a diagnostic 
system with the properties of lower complexity and 
easier implementation. As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed 
FNN consists of the following four layers in sequential 
order: an input layer, a fuzzification layer, a rule layer, 
and a class layer. This architecture can completely rep-
resent a Mamdani-like fuzzy model which is described 
as the following rules: 
Rule j:  If  
1x  is 
( )
1
jA  and … and Nx  is 
( )j
NA           (1) 
then  the input x belongs to class i. 
where j is a rule index, N denotes the number of input 
features,  Ak( j) represents the fuzzy set (linguistic term) 
in kth subpremise of rule j, x = [x1, x2,…, xN] indicates the 
set of all input features, and i is a class label which is a 
crisp index rather than a fuzzy set. Adopting such a 
model has two main merits. On one hand, we can in-
terpret the fuzzy model by means of natural language. 
This not only provides us some insights into the 
working of the diagnostic system, but can also facilitate 
the adaptation of design parameters and operating 
conditions of the system. On the other hand, since the 
consequent part of each if-then rule only contains a crisp 
class label, we do not require a complicated 
defuzzification method (such as center of gravity, or 
mean of maximum commonly used in Mamdani fuzzy 
models) to derive a crisp output for the result of fuzzy 
inference. Instead, we use the simplest winner-takes-all 
method to get the crisp output of the model. This merit 
largely simplifies the derivation of parameter learning 
algorithm as well as reducing the complexity of the 
model. Considering Fig. 1, we subsequently explain in 
more detail how the proposed FNN can implement the 
Mamdani-like fuzzy rules and inference.

to make a crisp interpretation for the diagnostic results. 
III. INTELLIGENT MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM 
The IMDS system is mainly comprised of three parts: 
a learning module, a knowledge base, and a web-based 
user interface. The architecture of the system is shown 
in Fig. 2. The objective of the learning module is to 
construct a FNN classifier not only with high classifi-
cation accuracy but also with good interpretability. This 
objective is accomplished by means of a series of 
learning algorithms including k-means clustering, gra-
dient descent parameter tuning, and similarity-based 
model simplification. The knowledge base is practically 
a FNN classifier. It consists of a fuzzy inference engine 
and a fuzzy medical rule database. The former performs 
fuzzy inference with respect to the presented input 
feature vectors so as to provide reasonable diagnostic 
results; the latter contains a collection of diagnostic 
rules acquired from available medical databases which 
store a great amount of data relating to patient’s records 
or medical history. The web-based user interface pro-
vides users with a convenience path to access the ser-
vice offered by the IMDS. Through this interface, users 
can submit their personal information and receive the 
related diagnoses in an easy manner. As the principles 
underlying the proposed FNN have been discussed in 
the previous section, we only introduce the other two 
parts in the following subsections. 
A. Initial Rule Learning Algorithm 
We apply the K-means clustering algorithm, which is 
one of the simplest algorithms in the field of pattern 
recognition, to acquire representative information from 
the given patient’s records or medical history. Each of 
the obtained clusters stands for a prototype for a par-
ticular behavior of the medical knowledge under con-
sideration; that is, each cluster can be used to define a 
diagnostic rule. Moreover, directly projecting each 
cluster onto individual inputs can obtain initial mem-
bership functions for each rule [19]. Fig. 3 depicts the 
flowchart of the initial rule learning algorithm.

B. Parameter Learning Algorithm 
The parameter learning algorithm is developed based 
on the well-known gradient descent method. According 
to our previous works [22], the algorithm is summarized 
as follows. Let di be the desired class index, ei = di − aci 
indicate the class error, and learning rate η > 0. The pa-
rameter vector θkfk = [akfk, bkfk, ckfk]T of the membership 
function μkfk can be updated by the well-known delta 
learning rule:

Considering Eq. (6), we can find that in each time 
step, only the parameters of the membership function 
embedded in the winning fuzzy set neuron connected 
with the winning rule neuron should be adjusted; in 
other words, for a C-class classification problem, the 
number of parameter vectors that in each time step 
should be adjusted is less than or equal to C. This fact 
exhibits that the truncation operators employed in Eqs. 
(3) and (4) do effectively reduce the computational 
burden those algorithms employing algebraic operators 
will encounter. 
C. Model Simplification Algorithm 
We have developed a strategy to simplify the fuzzy 
diagnostic rules of the IMDS in order to enhance the 
interpretability of the obtained rules [23]. Based on the 
set-theoretic similarity measurement derived by the 
well-known determinant formula of area, the strategy 
consists of three steps: 1) fuzzy set mergence, 2) ante-
cedent feature pruning, and 3) rule number simplifica-
 6
1, and each negative answer as 0.  
The proposed algorithms are applied to automatically 
construct a FNN classifier from the BMD dataset. We 
designate the number of clusters as three so as to acquire 
three initial diagnostic rules, each of which respectively 
describes a single BMD class. After 300 iterations for 
parameter learning, the resultant FNN classifier gener-
ates 52 misclassifications (74% correct) on 200 training 
cases, and 14 misclassifications (69% correct) on 45 
testing cases. This leads to a recognition rate of 73% (66 
misclassifications) on the total data set. The obtained 
membership functions are shown in Fig. 6. Note here 
that the blue graphs indicate the antecedent membership 
functions of the rule describing normal situation, green 
graphs denote the membership functions of the rule 
describing osteopenia, and red graphs indicate the 
membership functions of the rule describing osteopo-
rosis.  
Due to heavy overlap between fuzzy sets in Fig. 6, 
however, it is obviously difficult to assign an appropri-
ate linguistic term to each fuzzy set. We further utilize 
the model simplification algorithm to enhance the in-
terpretability of the fuzzy sets. After model simplifica-
tion, the classifier generates 58 misclassifications (71% 
correct) on 200 training cases, and 15 misclassifications 
(66.7% correct) on 45 testing cases. This leads to a 
recognition rate of 70.2% (73 misclassifications) on the 
total data set. Fig. 7 shows the simplified fuzzy sets. 
Although the classification accuracy decreases about 
4%, it is evident that the latter has much better inter-
pretability than the former. Considering both accuracy 
and interpretability, we employ the simplified FNN as 
the kernel of the IMDS.

Finally, we gather additional 10 cases for clinical 
testing, among which normal has two cases, osteopenia 
has five cases, and osteoporosis has three cases. After 
presenting all the cases into the IMDS, the system gen-
erates only two misclassifications (80% correct). Figs. 8 
and 9 show one of the cases and its results of risk as-
sessment, respectively. Given the T-score of this case is 
2.9− , as shown in Fig. 9, the IMDS evidently provides 
correct results of osteoporosis risk assessment.
