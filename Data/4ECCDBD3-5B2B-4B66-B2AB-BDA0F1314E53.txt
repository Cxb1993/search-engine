前言 
    Recently, phase 1 Merci Retriever study has shown that cerebral embolectomy with the Merci Retriever is 
safe and that successful recanalization can benefit a significant number of patients, even when performed in an 
extended 8-hr time window [1]. Although no neuroprotectant is of proven benefit in the treatment of focal 
ischemic stroke in human beings, several currently available interventions have shown promising results in 
preliminary clinical trials. A safe and powerful neuroprotectant is urgently needed in parallel with the progress 
in thrombolytic therapy. Three therapeutic modalities have been proposed that may eventually lead to 
improvements in post-stroke functional recovery over time, in addition to thrombolytic therapy, the only 
treatment protocol widely used and approved by the FDA. The first option requires a therapy aimed at unique 
steps in gray and white matter, cortical and subcortical injuries, or interventions targeted at common points in 
the injury cascades, thereby decreasing various cytoarchitectural injures and functional deficits caused by an 
ischemic insult [2, 3]. The second option is to stimulate or promote neuronal sprouting, myelin regeneration, 
dendritic arborization and synaptic rewiring in the injured brain and to decrease post-insult functional and 
electrophysiological diaschisis in remote areas [4-7]. The third, the ultimate hope, is to introduce pleuripotent 
stem cells originating from other organs or hematopoietic tissues into the ischemic brain and/or to enhance 
postischemic endogenous or hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation, migration and differentiation into the 
damaged brain, thus offering the restoration of neuronal, axonal and synaptic functions lost by injury and 
replenishing and rewiring the damaged neural network [8-10]. We have previously demonstrated the first 
option of treatment modality with melatonin with some initial success in the field [2, 3, 11]. We are now sought 
to pursue the second and the third options for melatonin-mediated neuroprotection in this field of applications. 
In the first year of the grant, we will clarify whether melatonin can induce a long-lasting neuroprotective action 
against ischemia-reperfusion insult. In the second year of the grant we will attempt to evaluate whether delayed 
administration of melatonin can enhance post-ischemic neuroplasticity, and also assess whether delayed 
melatonin can further reduce spontaneous apoptosis of post-ischemic endogenous neurogenesis. In the third 
year, we will plan to evaluate the electrophysiological recovery following a prolonged recovery period after 
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, and also to further clarify the mechanisms of action of melatonin by which it 
may act to re-wire the brain circuitry of the damaged brain. 
    Melatonin (N-aceyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has a variety of pharmacological actions that may be beneficial 
in the treatment of ischemic stoke [2, 3]. This natural neuroprotectant is endogenously produced from 
l-tryptophan, and is well known to be a potent free radical scavenger and an antioxidant [12-14]. Melatonin is 
safe and non-toxic for humans, and its administration via the oral route or systemic administration is convenient. 
It has been shown to be cytoprotective in both global and focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion models in rats 
[15-18]. We have previously demonstrated that a single intravenous administration of melatonin reduced brain 
infarction and improved neurobehavioral and electrophysiological outcomes after the onset of transient focal 
cerebral ischemia in rats [2].We have also demonstrated that melatonin protects against ischemia-induced 
neuronal loss, oligodendrocyte pathology and axonal injury via decreasing membranous lipid peroxidation and 
oxidative DNA damage in a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia [3]. We also shown that cerebral 
endothelial cells are highly sensitive to excitotoxicity and oxidative damage elicited by ischemia-reperfusion 
[19]. Additionally, melatonin treatment has been shown to increase neuronal survival and decrease apoptosis by 
inhibiting the activations of caspase-3 following ischemia-reperfusion. This melatonin-induced neuroprotection 
was shown to be present, when combined with t-PA in a mouse model of mild focal cerebral ischemia [20]. 
Additionally, melatonin has been shown to be highly effective in different in vivo and in vitro models of 
excitotoxicity in mice [21-23]. We, therefore, proposed that melatonin might have the potential to attenuate 
dose of melatonin was based on the pharmacokinetic study and neuroprotective dose-responsive studies of 
melatonin in a rodent model of transient focal cerebral ischemia [2, 3, 11]. Animals will be random assigned to 
a 7- or 28-day recovery period. Accordingly, 4 groups of animals will be included in the experiments during the 
first year. In the second and third year of grants, we plan to given melatonin (5 mg/kg, n=20), i.p., or vehicle 
(n=20) daily for 5 consecutive days starting 24 h after the ischemia-reperfusion. Animals will be given BrdU 
(50 mg/kg, ip) for labeling the s phase cells and will be allowed for a recovery period of 7 or 28 days. 
Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) recordings  
Prior to the ischemic insult and following a reperfusion period of 7 or 28 days, each animal was anesthetized in 
a cage (60 x 45 x 45 cm³) made with aluminum columns and copper meshes. The animal’s head was fixed with 
a stereotaxic frame adjusted so that the surface of the skull was level between bregma and lambda. The cranium 
was then exposed to create two 1.5-mm diameter holes drilled above the SI for each hemisphere. Appropriate 
stereotaxic coordinates were measured from bregma and from midline (AP: -0.5 and –2.0 mm; L: 4.0 and 2.5 
mm, for fore- and hindpaw receptive fields, respectively) [2, 28]. Upon exposure of the cortex, the dura was 
gently removed and the surface covered with warm saline. Ametal microelectrode (impedance 500 kW at 1000 
Hz) was positioned 0.5 mm below the cortical surface. Signals were filtered with band-pass (10-2000 Hz) and 
notch (60 Hz) filters and were recorded digitally on a computer with the associated software (Medelec Synergy 
Suite EMG/EP, Oxford Instruments, United Kingdom). Somatosensory stimuli consisted of transcutaneous 
electric stimulation (3 mA dc, 1.0 ms duration, 1 Hz) of the fore-and hindpaws contralateral to the recording 
side. A current stimulator and isolation unit constantly produced electric pulses delivering to the 
intraparenchymal needle electrode placed in the contralateral sensory cortex. Average records of at least 20 
evoked potentials were computed on-line and stored on disk. A custom-made software analysis provided 
measures of latency and field potentials. All SSEPs that had recognizable waveforms of the first positive (P1) 
and the first negative (N1) peaks were used for latency and amplitude measurements. The amplitude was 
defined in term of the difference between P1 and N1. 
Neurobehavioral testing and body weight measurements 
Body weight measurement was employed daily. Neurologic evaluation was conducted prior to and after the 
ischemia-reperfusion insult and on a daily basis up to 7 days after reperfusion by two observers unaware of 
treatment protocol. Two neurologic grading systems were used: (1) a sensorimotor grading scale modified from 
previously published methods [2, 3, 11, 26, 27] with five categories (0 to 4) for forward and sideways visual 
placing tests of the affected forelimb and five categories (0 to 4) for motor outcome and (2) a grading scale of 0 
to 28 developed.
