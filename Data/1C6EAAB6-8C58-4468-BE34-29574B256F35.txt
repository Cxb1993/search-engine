英文摘要 
The space-time block code (STBC) multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) zero-padding orthogonal 
frequency division multiplexing (ZP-OFDM) has been 
widely investigated in recent years. It provides a good 
performance for the multi-user scenario with a small 
number of pilots. However, it would fail in face of 
complex symmetric signals. In this project, novel 
channel estimation and equalization for complex input 
signals are investigated. With the Alamouti-like STBC 
scheme, the channel impulse responses of the 
space-time coded MIMO ZP-OFDM system are shown 
to be identifiable up to two ambiguity matrices by 
subspace channel estimation. Furthermore, we propose 
a forward-backward averaging technique to enhance 
the performances of blind channel estimation. 
Computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness 
and correctness of channel estimation for the 
space-time coded MIMO ZP-OFDM systems.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Wideband wireless communication systems with both 
high data rate and high quality transmission have been 
widely studied in recent years. One promising technique 
for achieving this goal is the orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with 
space-time processing, which is considered as a 
candidate for the fourth-generation (4G) wideband 
communication system [1][2]. The use of multiple 
Extending the identifiability analysis in [30], we show 
that the CIRs of MIMO STC-OFDM systems are 
identifiable up to two ambiguity matrices. Another 
contribution of this project is the performance 
enhancement of channel estimators. We propose a 
forward-backward (FB) averaging technique to enhance 
the performances of blind channel estimation. The FB 
averaging technique is extensively used in adaptive 
beamforming [33] and STBC-CDMA systems [34]. 
Owing to the property of STBC, the FB averaging 
technique can be applied here.

II. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider a K-user quasi-synchronous uplink MIMO 
OFDM system shown in Fig. 1 which is equipped with 
two transmit antennas using Alamouti’s STBC scheme 
at the transmitter and  ( )J J K≥  receive antennas at 
the receiver. It is straightforward to apply this system to 
downlink with K virtual users [30]. Let

and L denote the maximum delay spread of all channels. 
To avoid IBI caused by multipath fading channel, the 
insertion of a cyclic prefix (CP) or zero-padding (ZP) 
symbols are often used in OFDM systems. We adopt 
ZP-OFDM here because of simple channel estimation 
and low sensitivity to channel zeros [16]. Without loss 
of generality, L  zeros are padded behind ( )kiu  and 
( )k

( = + )M M N L . In [30], Zeng proposed the MIMO 
space-time coded OFDM for either real or complex 
symmetric signals. When the input symbols are 
complex with symmetry, they satisfy

proposed in [30] can work for real signals only but not 
for complex symmetric signals. In order to apply the 
STBC ZP-OFDM system to high-order modulation 
scheme such as 16-QAM or higher order ones, a novel 
semi-blind channel estimation is developed in the 
following.  
 
III. NOVEL SEMI-BLIND CHANNEL ESTIMATION 
In this section we propose a novel semi-blind 
channel estimation algorithm to resolve the problem 
stated in Section II. Let [ ]= (0)  ( 1) Tu u N −u … , 
[ ]= (0)  ( 1) Ts s N −s …  and HN=u A s , i.e. ( )u n  is the 
N point IDFT of ( )s k . Considering the 
complex-conjugate property of DFT/IDFT operation, 
the IDFT of *( )s k  is then given by *( )u N n− , which 
is expressed in matrix-vector form by 
* * * * = (0) ( 1)  (1)
TH
N u u N u⎡ ⎤−⎣ ⎦A s … . However, the 
irregular order of *HNA s  makes channel estimation 
difficult [35]. To ease the derivation of channel 
estimation, the Alamouti-like STBC scheme is 
proposed by adding a phase shift matrix onto the 
second input vector of the STBC coding matrix,

multiplying an OFDM block symbol *s  by the phase 
matrix Φ  will result in a circular time shift to the

Alamouti- like STBC scheme is presented in [36] for 
single-carrier block transmission over multipath fading 
channels. A permutation matrix is introduced to 
perform time reversal of the second input vector of the 
STBC coding matrix. With this permutation matrix, the 
diversity gains can be acquired with proper linear 
receiver processing. On the other hand, the phase shift 
matrix of the proposed Alamouti-like STBC scheme is 
used to adjust the IDFT of s* in order. 
Performing the IDFT operation on (11) and using the 
circular shift property of IDFT, we have

Through (8) and (14), we then develop a novel 
semi-blind channel estimation algorithm next. 
Note that there is no constraint on the OFDM block 
symbol ( )kis  except that its elements are independent. 
Therefore, the components in iv  are uncorrelated and 
the correlation matrix vR  is nonsingular. The

Moreover, a multi-user scenario with multiple receive 
antennas is studied in this project. Therefore, it is worth 
to further investigate the identifiability problem of the 
proposed channel estimation. 
The identifiability analysis is heavily dependent on 
the structure of H  in (14). By defining

, we have the following 
lemma. 
Lemma 1: If (0)F  is of full column rank, H  is 
also of full column rank. 
Proof: We can find two permutation matrices P and Q 
such that 
                =F PHQ                (25) 
where P and Q are row and column permutation 
matrices, respectively

and iω  and iε  respectively indicate 2   1M ×  and 
2   1N ×  vectors in which the -thi  element is one and 
the others are zeros. We then have

Since (0)F  is of full column rank and F  is a 
2 2JM KN×  block lower triangular matrix, we can 
easily show from [Theorem 1, 29] that F  and hence 
H  are of full column rank. 
Lemma 2: If ( )lF  is of full column rank, ( )L l−F  
is also of full column rank. 
Proof: Let ( )L l− =F α 0  where α  is a 2 1K ×  
coefficient vector. Partition α  as two 1K ×  
subvectors, 1 2(  )
T T T=α α α . Then ( )L l− =F α 0  can be

Since ( )lF  is of full column rank, we have

also of full column rank.

composed by ( )j lh

From Theorem 3, we know that the channel 
coefficients can be obtained by subspace technique up 
to two K K×  invertible matrices. Besides, though it is 
assumed that the channel order is known exactly in 
Theorem 3, the identifiability of channel estimation is 
still applied when the channel order is overestimated. 
Assume that the estimated channel order is L  with 
L L≥ . Then M N L= +  and the channel matrix in

where the zero entries are caused by overestimation of

With the new channel matrix in (33), ′H  can be

shown to be identifiable up to two ambiguity matrices. 
The FB averaging technique using the STBC property is 
also proposed to enhance the channel estimation 
performance.  
 
 
APPENDIX A: PROOF OF THEOREM 3 
According to assumptions that H  and H

 have 
identical structures and both (0)F  and (0)F

 are of 
full column rank, it is seen from Lemma 1 that H  and 
Hˆ  are matrices of full column rank. We then have that 
( ) ( )span span=H H  if and only if there exists a 
2   2KN KN×  full rank matrix B  such that 
  = H HB

.              (38) 
With =F PHQ   and using (25) and (38), F  becomes 
H H H= = =F PHBQ PP FQ BQ FQ BQ   .  (39) 
Note that P  and Q  are unitary matrices, i.e. 
H =P P I  and H =Q Q I . Since HQ BQ  is also 
invertible, we have ( ) ( )span span=F F . Partition 
HQ BQ  into an N N×  block matrix,

[Theorem 2, 29] that HQ BQ  is a block lower 
triangular matrix with identical diagonal blocks. 
Similarly, since F  and F

 are also block upper 
triangular matrices and ( )LF

 and ( )LF  are of full 
column rank as revealed in Lemma 2, it is easily shown 
that HQ BQ  is a block upper triangular matrix with 
identical diagonal blocks. Therefore, HQ BQ  can be 
reduced to a block diagonal matrix

計畫成果自評 
  正交分頻多工調變系統(OFDM)廣泛地應用於寬頻無線通訊系統。目前OFDM 已被採
用於一些無線傳輸標準，例如無線區域網路IEEE 802.11x、都會網路IEEE 802.16、個人網
路IEEE 802.20 及數位聲訊/視訊傳播(DAB/DVB)等。另外，空時 編碼技術近年來廣泛地被
討論，而它與OFDM 系統也已成為第四代寬頻行動通 訊標準技術之一。空時碼使用空間
分集特性配合特殊的編碼，以提供衰落通道下的分集增益。尤其加上多輸入多輸出(MIMO)
系統，可以有效地提高通訊容量及分集增益。但是多輸入多輸出系統的設計與分析的複雜
度也隨之增加。 
本研究計畫針對空時區塊碼 MIMO ZP-OFDM 的多使用者系統，探討在頻率選擇衰落
通道下，多使用者環境的空時區塊碼 MIMO ZP-OFDM 系統之通道估測及接收濾波器的設
計與分析。在多使用者存取相同頻帶的空時區塊碼MIMO ZP-OFDM 系統，其訊號模型的
建立遠比在單一使用者來的複雜，而所需探討議題也多了許多，我們提出一修正的空時區
塊碼，利用此碼，空時區塊碼 MIMO ZP-OFDM 的訊號模型可以有效的整理。利用子空間
正交的特性，我們提出子空間通道估測法，我們將證明估測的正確與唯一性。另外由於子
空間通道估測方法對於收集的資料量非常敏感，因此我們將利用空時區塊碼前後兩個時間
所接收到的資料之間的關聯加入 forward-backward 平均法以改善通道估測的性能及加快
收斂速度。 
 本研究計畫可以使參與人員對於空時碼與多輸入多輸出正交分頻多工多重存取系統的
結合和對應的半盲目通道估測有完整之認識。因此本計畫的執行將有助於提升國內第四代
行動通訊技術的研發與多使用者偵測技術的研究水準。 
  本計劃的研究成果已發表於國外重要期刊[1]及歐洲無線通信高峰會研討會[2].

文投稿，713篇被接受，參加學者很多。第一天先報到，才發現會議地點是

using (6) and (7). The linearly constrained minimum variance 
(LCMV) and eigenspace receivers are reviewed and the 
weight analysis is presented as follows. 
A. Receiver Design

power while passing the desired signals with unit-gain 
constraints [7]

where ( )ikw  is the receiver weight vector to extract the symbol

( ) ( ) 2 4H Hs n NQE n n σ⎡ ⎤= = +⎣ ⎦R z z GΩ G I                (9) 
where ( )1 4,...,s Kdiag ρ ρ= ⊗Ω I , kρ  and 2nσ  are signal 
power of user k and noise power, respectively. It is well 
known that the weight vector of LCMV receiver is given by 
( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )11 1   ,    1, ,4i i i iHk k k k i−− −= =w g R g R g K .                (10) 
Ideally, the weight vector of the LCMV receiver in (10) will 
fall onto the signal subspace of R. Performing the eigenvalue-
eigenvector decomposition (EVD) on R yields two 
orthogonal subspaces 4 4NQ Ks C
×∈U  and 4 (4 4 )NQ NQ Kn C × −∈U , 
where sU  spans the same subspace as G and is called the 
signal subspace. Unfortunately, the weight vectors in (10) 
will deviate from the signal subspace if finite sample effects 
and/or signature vector errors exist. The eigenspace receiver 
utilizes the orthogonal subspace property to generate the 
weight vector by  
( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )11 1, ,   1, ,4i i i iH H Hk s k s s s k s s s k i−− −= =w g U Λ U g U Λ U g K .  (11) 
where sΛ  is a 4 4K K×  diagonal matrix whose diagonal 
elements are the eigenvalues corresponding to eigenspace sU . 
The eigenspace receiver will produce a lower BER than the 
LCMV receiver in a finite sample scenario [7].

where 1( ) ( )n n=z z . ˆ fbR  in (25) can be treated as a sample 
correlation matrix with 4T samples. In addition, since ,i QNM  
is a matrix with ones and zeros, ˆ fbR  can be derived from Rˆ  
by the cost of permutations and complex conjugate operations 
only. The computation of ˆ fbR  in (25) requires negligibly 
extra 2 248N Q  additions over the computation of Rˆ  which 
requires 2 216TN Q  multiplications and 2 216( 1)T N Q−  
additions. Consequently, the computation of ˆ fbR  requires 
only a little higher cost than that of Rˆ . 
5. COMPUTER SIMULATIONS 
Consider the space-time coded MC-CDMA systems with 
four transmit and two receive antennas. The transmit symbol 
is adopted the QPSK modulation scheme, and unit-energy 
spreading codes of length N=32 is used. The channel impulse 
response of length L=6 is modeled by finite impulse response 
(FIR) with i.i.d. complex Gaussian of zero-mean and variance 
1/L. The input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as the bit 
SNR at each receive antenna. Fig.1 shows the bit-error rate 
(BER) versus the number of STBC blocks. The channel 
impulse responses are estimated by the subspace technique 
[5]. It is shown that the forward-backward averaging 
technique enhances the LCMV and eigenspace receivers 
considerably. To verify the correctness of the weight analysis, 
the simulation results by using (12) and (13) are also 
presented. These BERs computed by using weight vectors in 
(10) and (12) as well as in (11) and (13) are almost identical, 
respectively. This validates the weight analysis even in the 
finite sample scenario. The BER versus the number of users 
varied from 2 to 32 is studied in Fig. 2. It is observed that the 
eigenspace receiver is more susceptible to the increase of user 
number than the LCMV receiver. The influence of the 
interferences is less sensitive in the LCMV receiver when the 
number of users is smaller than the available degrees of 
freedom of weight vectors [7]. On the other hand, the 
interference produces a larger variation on the output 
interference power in the eigenspace-based filter [7]. Thus the 
eigenspace receiver has faster degradation on the BERs than 
the LCMV receiver when the number of users is increased. 
However, the former still has a lower BER than the latter.

感覺還不夠國際化。最近幾年大陸積極舉辦國際會議，提供他們老師、碩
博士生一個很好的機會與場地去發表研究成果，台灣這方面要留意，還好
明年台灣也舉辦了兩個重量級會議，IEEE ICASSP 及 IEEE ICCAS。除了參
與學術活動之外，專程參觀了北京大學及清華大學的校園及系所，大陸的
大學系館都有一名警衛看守，感覺有一點戒備森嚴，不過北京大學及清華
大學的確是百年古校，校園的園景規劃真是古色古香，令人賞心悅目。也
參觀北大學生上課情形，北大的上課地點是採取集中式的設計，有兩棟新
的上課大樓，我散步進入教室參觀，因為看起來啟用不久，硬體設施非常
新穎，學生在如此的環境中學習應該有很好的表現吧。

using (6) and (7). The linearly constrained minimum variance 
(LCMV) and eigenspace receivers are reviewed and the 
weight analysis is presented as follows. 
A. Receiver Design 
The LCMV receiver minimizes the overall receiver output 
power while passing the desired signals with unit-gain 
constraints [7]

             (8) 
where ( )ikw  is the receiver weight vector to extract the symbol 
( ) (4 1)kb n i+ −  and R is the ensemble correlation matrix of (6) 
( ) ( ) 2 4H Hs n NQE n n σ⎡ ⎤= = +⎣ ⎦R z z GΩ G I                (9) 
where ( )1 4,...,s Kdiag ρ ρ= ⊗Ω I , kρ  and 2nσ  are signal 
power of user k and noise power, respectively. It is well 
known that the weight vector of LCMV receiver is given by 
( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )11 1   ,    1, ,4i i i iHk k k k i−− −= =w g R g R g K .                (10) 
Ideally, the weight vector of the LCMV receiver in (10) will 
fall onto the signal subspace of R. Performing the eigenvalue-
eigenvector decomposition (EVD) on R yields two 
orthogonal subspaces 4 4NQ Ks C
×∈U  and 4 (4 4 )NQ NQ Kn C × −∈U , 
where sU  spans the same subspace as G and is called the 
signal subspace. Unfortunately, the weight vectors in (10) 
will deviate from the signal subspace if finite sample effects 
and/or signature vector errors exist. The eigenspace receiver 
utilizes the orthogonal subspace property to generate the 
weight vector by  
( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )11 1, ,   1, ,4i i i iH H Hk s k s s s k s s s k i−− −= =w g U Λ U g U Λ U g K .  (11) 
where sΛ  is a 4 4K K×  diagonal matrix whose diagonal 
elements are the eigenvalues corresponding to eigenspace sU . 
The eigenspace receiver will produce a lower BER than the 
LCMV receiver in a finite sample scenario [7]. 
B. Weight Analysis
