hand, when a constant viscosity is chosen to match 
the observed wave damping rate (backward modeling), 
the predicted velocity profiles in the mud layer are 
not satisfactory and the corresponding viscosity is 
lower than the measured value. These discrepancies 
are less pronounced when waves become more energetic. 
Differences between the linear and nonlinear model 
results become significant in low energy condition, 
suggesting an amplification of wave nonlinear effect 
due to non-Newtonian rheology. In general, the 
constant viscosity assumption for modeling wave-mud 
interaction is only appropriate for more energetic 
wave condition.

et al. 2009], Brazil [Vinzon et al. 2009; Rogers and Holland 2009], South Korea [Wells, 1983], and 
Surinam [Wells and Coleman, 1981]. In the past several decades, many researchers have been devoted 
to study the physical processes and numerical modeling of wave-mud interaction, including 
wave-induced mud transport [e.g., Vinzon and Mehta 1998; Traykovski et al. 2000, 2007; Hsu et al. 
2009; Jaramillo et al. 2009; Safak et al. 2010] and surface wave attenuation [e.g., Dalrymple and Liu 
1978; Winterwerp et al. 2007; Elgar and Raubenheimer 2008; Rogers and Holland 2009; Kranenburg et 
al. 2011 among many others]. In some of the aforementioned numerical modeling studies, large wave 
dissipation is modeled through a two-layer Newtonian-type viscous model. However, data from 
rheometer tests indicated that wave-mud interaction may be quite complex because highly concentrated 
cohesive sediment essentially behaves as non-Newtonian fluid [e.g., Krone 1963; Toorman 1997; 
Soltanpour and Samsami 2011]. For example, Hayter and Mehta [1982] suggested that 18 parameters 
are necessary in order to fully characterize the rheological behavior of mud. These parameters are 
dependent on mineralogical composition, sediment concentration, floc properties, and 
bio-chemical-physical processes. 
Different rheological closure models for mud, such as viscous, poro-elastic, visco-plastic and 
visco-elastic, have been implemented in the flow momentum equation and solved semi-analytically or 
numerically [e.g., Gade, 1958; Dalrymple and Liu, 1978; Yamamoto et al., 1978; McPherson, 1980; 
Mei and Liu, 1987; Maa and Mehta, 1990; Foda et al., 1993; Kaihatu, 2007; Chan and Liu, 2009; Elgar 
and Raubenheimer, 2008; Torres-Freyermuth and Hsu, 2010]. Linear models, which adopt linear wave 
assumption and treat mud as highly viscous fluid, was first developed by Gade [1958]. Dalrymple and 
Liu [1978] further extend this linear theory to be applicable to both shallow and deep water conditions. 
Dalrymple and Liu [1978] revealed that the peak damping rate occurs when the Stokes boundary layer 
thickness is the same order as mud layer thickness. Within the framework of visco-elastic models, the 
key feature is that the elastic property may trigger mud layer’s resonance, which significantly amplifies 
the water-mud interface amplitude, and hence surface energy is dissipated in this manner [e.g., Maa and 
Mehta, 1990]. Recently, the nonlinear energy transfers are recognized to contribute to surface damping 
via nonlinear wave-wave interaction [e.g., Sheremet and Stone 2003; Winterwerp et al., 2007; Kaihatu 
et al. 2007; Elgar and Raubenheimer, 2008; Torres-Freyermuth and Hsu, 2010; Mei et al. 2010; Alam 
et al. 2011]. A key question regarding how the nonlinear response of the mud layer in conjunction with 
nonlinear wave-wave interaction can affect the resulting dynamics of mud and surface wave 
attenuation remains to be clarified.  
 Among many rheological models, the viscous model is probably the most frequently used 
because of its easy implementation in wave transformation models. The visco-plastic model (Bingham) 
can be extended from the viscous model by using the viscosity regulation method which converts yield 
stress to be part of apparent viscosity [e.g., Frigaard and Nouar, 2005]. Owing to the complexity to 
characterize the properties of mud and control the wave and current conditions in the field, most 
model-data comparison relies on well-controlled laboratory experiments. For instance, in the laboratory 
study of Sakakiyama and Bijker, [1989], the rheological behavior of kaoline was characterized by a 
 4
under waves. Furthermore, in order to gain insight on the diagnostic and prognostic capability of the 
two-layer model employing a constant viscosity closure, the model reported in Dalrymple and Liu 
[1978] is applied here as the linear model. To contrast the effect of wave nonlinearity, a nonlinear wave 
propagation model solving Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation with a volume-of-fluid scheme 
for free-surface wave propagation [Lin and Liu, 1998] is modified here to model a two-layer wave-mud 
system with constant viscosity assumption.  
 This paper is organized as follow. We first introduce the experiment set-up, tests conditions, 
rheology analysis, and model descriptions in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the modeling of wave 
damping and velocity profiles within the fluid-mud layer. Discussions on the rheological response of 
mud layer and the forward/backward modeling using a constant viscosity closure is presented in 
section 4. Finally, conclusions and future work are summarized in section 5. 
2. Methods 
2.1 Wave flume experiment 
 The experiments were conducted in a wave flume (20 m long×0.5 m wide×0.8 m deep) in Tainan 
Hydraulics Laboratory (THL). Figures 1 (a), (b) and (d) show the dimension of the experimental setup. 
A false bottom and sloping beach were constructed at the two side-ends of the wave flume creating a 
trench to hold the mud. The mud layer is 8.77 m long and 0.06 m thick, with a bulk density (ρB) of 
1420 kg/m3 (704 g/L). The fresh water is slowly filled into the flume in order to avoid disturbing the 
mud layer. The total depth is set to be 0.3 m including the mud layer thickness (see Figure 1b). Eight 
capacitance-type wave gages, with equal spacing of 1.086 m, were used to measure spatial evolution of 
surface waves. An Electromagnetic Current Meter (ECM, ACM2-RS) is used to measure horizontal and 
vertical velocities at the pre-selected locations (z= 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11, 0.13, 
0.18, 0.23 m above the bed). Detailed synchronizing technique and validation are discussed in Section 
3.2. For each test condition, free-surface elevation and flow velocity were measured at 50 Hz for 10 
minutes. The mud concentration profiles before and after experiment were measured at two horizontal 
locations with vertical resolution of 0.02m from the bottom up to 0.12 m above the bed. Results show 
that the sediment concentration changes only slightly during the experiment (see Figure 1c) and the 
system can be approximated as a two-layer system with a constant mud density and mud layer 
thickness. It is noted that the initial concentration of mud layer in Figure 1(c) is 1310 kg/m3 (521 g/L) 
which is lower than other cases presented in this paper because mud of higher density is too sticky to 
be withdrawn via siphon method. We assume that similar features of mud concentration profile also 
exist at a higher mud density.  
 In this study, we select commercial kaoline (GC-1000), purchased from Meilin Chemical 
Company (Taiwan), to be used in the experiments owing to its similar rheological behavior to the 
natural mud [e.g., Otsubo and Muraoka, 1988]. The primary particle grain size is D50=2.8 μm, and 
mineralogical compositions are SiO2 (52.5 %), Al2O3 (45.5 %), Fe2O3 (0.5%) and TiO2 (1.1%). The 
sediment dry density was obtained from dry weighting method and it is around ρs=2500 kg/m3. In order 
to ensure mud properties being uniform along the flume and to let the kaoline slurry reach a fully

2.2 Rheology of kaoline 
 Wave-mud interaction is a coupled system between the water wave mechanics and the 
rheological behavior of mud. Field and laboratory observations suggest significant wave attenuation 
occurs above highly concentrated fluid mud where sediment concentration can reach several hundred 
grams per liter. The rheological stress in the mud layer affects the surface waves via the effective 
viscosity, changing boundary layer structure, and causing wave dissipation. In order to characterize the 
rheology of kaoline in a range similar to that observed during the experiments, the rheology test is 
conducted with four different mass concentrations in the range of c=338-737 g/L. The mud samples

determined by best-fit with the measured data, and they are

c1= 1.2075846^107, c2= 12.572939, d1= 2.9643, d2= -1.1972 
 A comparison between the measured data and the resulting hybrid formula (dashed curves in 
Figure 2) shows a very good agreement. It is noted that the empirical coefficients B is always negative 
whereas coefficient D changes from negative to positive as sediment concentration increases. As a 
result, equation (2) remains similar to the structural kinetics used in equation (1) and hence a transition 
from the initial to the final state of rheological behavior is parameterized. On the other hand, equation 
(2) gives an infinite viscosity when shear rate is zero and it becomes identical to the Bingham-plastic 
model. Finally, the hybrid equation suggests that the kaoline behaves from non-Newtonian flow to 
Newtonian flow as mud concentration decreases and finally reduces to water viscosity at zero sediment 
concentration. Based on the range of concentration tested in this study and the fluid property observed, 
this formula may be valid for fully fluidized mud.

2.3 Wave-mud interaction models 
 We use both a linear model and a nonlinear model to study wave-mud interaction. The two-layer 
model developed by Dalrymple and Liu [1978] is adopted here as linear model. In this model, the 
wave-mud interaction is separated as a two-layer system where the upper layer is an invisid water layer 
and the lower layer is a mud layer with uniform density and constant viscosity. For a given set of wave 
and mud parameters (H, T, h, d, μ and ρB) the model provides damping rate, interfacial amplitude, and 
velocity profiles. On the other hand, in order to simulate fully nonlinear wave propagation, we modify 
a nonlinear wave propagation model [Lin and Liu 1998], which solves the Reynolds-Averaged 
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with a volume of fluid (VOF) method for free-surface tracking. More 
recently, this model is enhanced with a mixture formulation for mud transport by Torres-Freyermuth

Figure 3: Measured time-series of surface wave elevation at different cross-shore locations for 
wave-mud interaction (solid curves) and clear fluid (dashed curves) for wave conditions of Case 2C  
(ρB =1420 kg/m3, T= 1.2 sec and H=0.04 m). 
 
Figure 4 shows the comparison of time series of surface elevation at three cross-shore locations 
between measured data and nonlinear model results for Case 2C and Case 4C. The time axis is shifted 
by t0, which is the corresponding time period when experiment and model results reach their 
quasi-stationary states. The two cases presented in Figure 4 correspond to the same wave periods but 
different wave heights with Case 4C having larger nonlinearity (ka=0.145). When Stokes 5th-order 
wave is set from the left boundary of the nonlinear model with the best-fit viscosity specified (see 
Table 1), the nonlinear model predicts the decay rate and wave shape in agreement with measured data 
for both cases. The nonlinear model shows its ability to model the effect of wave nonlinearity for Case 
4c during wave mud interaction. For this case, the measured and model skewness at x=11.93m are 0.42 
and 0.36, respectively. 
To quantify surface attenuation, the damping coefficient, ki, has been widely used as a damping 
indicator. The damping coefficient ki describe the decay of wave height as:   
   ܪ ൌ ܪ଴݁ି௞೔௫ (3)
 
where H0 is initial wave height and x is the propagation distance. This formula suggests that the wave 
height decays exponentially with propagation distance. Because the interaction of surface wave and 
muddy seabed decreases with propagating distance, a nearly zero damping is obtained as x approaches

3.2 Velocity profile 
 In addition to the rheology data, it is necessary to obtain velocity field in the mud layer in order 
to better understand the coupling between the fluid mud layer and the surface wave. Measuring the 
time-dependent velocity profiles in the high turbid water (O(100) g/L) relies on only a few devices 
because optical instrument may not be applicable. Acoustic profilers have been demonstrated to be 
effective in the field. However, measuring time-dependent velocity profile in the laboratory is difficult 
in that field instrument, such as PC-ADP, cannot provide sufficient temporal resolution (smaller than 2 
Hz) for water waves with wave period around O (1) sec and instrument dimension can significantly 
interferes wave propagation (instrument diameter more than 0.1 m) [e.g., Jaramillo et al. 2009] and 
hence a different measurement technique is necessary for the present small wave flume. A suitable 
device is the ECM [De Wit, 1995], which was shown useful in both the clear water and highly 
concentrated fluid mud (400 kg/m3). However, this device measures 2-D velocity at a single point and 
hence it becomes more cumbersome to obtain velocity profiles. In this study, we reconstruct the 
time-dependent velocity profiles by measuring velocity at selected positions in the water column and 
develop a synchronization procedure to match the velocity data at different locations. In this section, 
we first discuss the synchronizing technique, which is then followed by its validation and the resulting 
velocity profiles.

other hand, the velocity gradient at flow reversal is small and the velocity profiles are more continuous. 
Both linear and nonlinear models underestimate the velocity gradient near the interface under the crest, 
while at the reversal it is over-predicted for Case 2F (long wave condition). Many previous modeling 
studies produce large velocity gradient near the water-mud interface that can be caused by different 
mechanisms. Liu and Chan [2007] adopted a visco-elastic model for a two-layer system and they 
explained that this discontinuity is caused by assuming inviscid fluid of the upper layer. This 
discontinuous viscosity gradient across the water-mud interface results in large phase shift, which can 
reach about 60° with respect to the free-stream, and hence a sharp velocity variance at interface can be 
observed. Maa and Mehta [1990] considered vertical stratification of fluid mud which separates the 
mud layer into several sub-layers. The estimated Stokes boundary layer thickness in the top sub-layer is 
greater than its sub-layer thickness, which results in large velocity gradient at the interface. According 
to our rheometer test, the kaoline mud adopted in this study is of shear-thinning behavior and has 
noticeable yield stress at low shear rate. These features are too complicated to be described by the 
constant viscosity used in the linear and nonlinear models. In fact, the constant viscosity assumption is 
only valid here if the shear rate in the mud layer is more or less unchanged during the wave passage. 
We will elaborate this point in more details later. 
 Inside the mud layer, discrepancies can be observed between the measured velocity profiles and 
the predicted ones. Let us first define the wave boundary layer thickness as the distance between bed 
and the location of maximum velocity in the mud layer under the wave crest. In Figure 6 (a1), the 
measured data exhibits uniform velocity distribution in almost the entire mud layer except very close to 
the bed (below the lowest measurement location) where flow velocity must drop to zero at the bed due 
to no-slip boundary condition. This implies that the observed boundary layer thickness is less than 0.02 
m for Case 2B where the wave period is only 0.9 sec. Nonlinear model results suggest a similar 
boundary layer thickness (0.02-0.03 m) although the magnitude of velocity is over-predicted. The 
linear model predicts a significantly larger boundary layer thickness owing to the higher viscosity 
employed (in order to match the damping rate at the free-surface). During the flow reversal phase, 
measured data reveals typical overshoot phenomenon in the wave boundary layer and it is successfully 
captured by both the linear and nonlinear models (Figure 6 (a2)). As the wave period increases to 
T=2.1 sec (Case 2F), the boundary layer thickness is amplified to 0.04~0.05 m (see Figure 6(b1)). Both 
linear and nonlinear models predict similar velocity profiles and results indicate that the boundary layer 
thickness is equal to the mud layer thickness, which is slightly greater than the observed value. 
However, during flow reversal, both models over-predict the overshoot velocity magnitude (see Figure 
6(b2)). Large differences between modeled and observed velocity magnitudes inside the fluid mud 
layer may be related to an (instantaneous) enhancement in the mud viscosity owing to non-Newtonian 
rheology (see Figure7).   
 Using a cross-correlation algorithm, Figure 6 (a3) and (b3) present the phase-lag (or lead) of 
velocity in the mud layer with respect to the free-stream. A negative value in the phase shift represents 
that the velocity in the mud layer is ahead of the free-stream. The phase difference above the interface

4. Discussions 
4.1 Intra-wave rheological response    
 As demonstrated previously, measured velocity profiles in the mud layer exhibit different 
behavior from that predicted by both the linear and nonlinear models. The key assumption adopted in 
the present models is that the mud viscosity is a constant during wave-mud interaction. The constant 
viscosity assumption is questioned and further examined here. According to the rheology data (see 
Figure 2b in section 2.2), the kaoline clay used in the present study is of shear-thinning or Bingham 
plastic behavior under a wide range of shear rate. Hence, we can deduce that assuming a constant mud 
viscosity is only valid if the shear rate in the mud layer under the wave passage is also more or less 
unchanged. Because the time-dependent velocity profiles in the mud layer during wave-mud interaction 
are also measured (see section 3.2), we can compute the time-dependent shear rate profile in the mud 
layer and further evaluate the rheological response of fluid mud by computing the viscosity via 
equation (2). Due to limited vertical resolution in the mud layer (5 points in the mud layer with vertical 
resolution of 0.01 m), we calculate and present the depth-averaged shear rate magnitude by integrating 
the magnitude of velocity gradient calculated by two adjacent points from the lowest sampling location 
(0.02 mab) to the point just beneath the interface (0.06 mab):

where u is the phase-averaged horizontal velocity. Due to limited resolution and the depth-averaging, 
we present a conservative estimate of shear rate in the mud layer. The depth-averaged shear rate (t) is 
further used to calculate the corresponding mud viscosity by substituting (t) into equation (2). The

Case 2B and (b) Case 2F. m in the bottom panel is the mean shear stress averaged over one wave. 
 
4.2 Wave-averaged rheological response    
Measured data presented so far revealed that although sediment concentration in the mud layer is 
more or less constant, measured shear rate and hence the derived mud viscosity change significantly 
during one wave. Using the data measured in all the cases, we focus on the change of viscosity caused 
by wave forcing for a range of wave heights and wave periods, which can be useful for large-scale 
modeling. In order to establish a simple relation between the rheological response and the wave 
dynamic, we consider the time-averaged shear rate over one wave period T, which is defined as:

Hence, e is a bulk shear rate in the mud layer obtained via a double averaging (depth- and 
wave-averaging). Furthermore, we can calculate the measured bulk viscosity μe by substituting e into 
equation (2). To facilitate further discussions, we plot the relationship between the measured bulk 
viscosity μe and bulk shear rate e for all the cases in Figure 8. The rheology relationship given by 
equation (2), obtained independently with a rheometer using the same kaoline mud, is also shown in 
Figure 8 (dashed curve). We observe that a typical range of shear rate for wave-mud interaction in the 
present small-scale flume experiment is between 0.1~1 s-1. Due to the shear-thinning behavior of

value (e.g., Cases 3A-F and 4A-F) when energy flux is further increased. For wave energy flux 
becomes greater 2~3 N/s, the bulk viscosity reduces to 2~3 Pa.s and becomes essentially Newtonian 
(independent of bulk shear rate).  
Results discussed in Figure 7 (bottom panels) suggest that the temporal variation of 
depth-averaged shear stress in the mud layer is no more than 25% of its mean and hence it is 
conjectured that it may be a good approximation to specify an enhanced constant bottom stress in 
large-scale wave modeling. Here, we further calculate the bulk bottom stress ߬௕ by carrying out 
time-averaging over τ୫୳ୢሺtሻ (see (5)) for one wave period. Following Jonsson [1966], we 
parameterize ߬௕ using measured velocity amplitude Ub at 0.07 mab (the first point above the mud 
layer) and a friction factor fm: 
 
 ߬௕ ൌ 12ߩ ௠݂ܷ௕
ଶ Eq.(8)
 
The calculated ߬௕ due to wave-mud interaction increases with wave energy flux (Figure 9b) initially 
but reaches a plateau when wave energy flux become larger. The resulting friction factor fm is of very 
large value at very low energy flux, but decays to O(0.1) when wave energy flux becomes large. 
 
Figure 9: (a) Measured bulk shear rate and bulk viscosity plotted against wave energy flux. (b) Bulk 
bottom stress and friction factor due to wave-mud interaction plotted against wave energy flux.  
It is important to point out that the bulk bottom stress ߬௕ is calculated from the measured 
rheological properties of mud and velocity profiles via averaging, while the wave damping rate ki 
represents the wave attenuation in the direction of wave propagation measured directly by the wave 
gauges. It is only when the measured damping rate and bulk bottom stress are well-correlated, the 
bottom stress can be used as the key parameter in the large-scale modeling of wave attenuation. To 
further evaluate the applicability of such parameterization, the relationships between surface damping 
rate and bottom stress b are plotted in Figure 10 for all the cases measured in the present study. A good 
correlation between ki and ߬௕ is observed for Case 2 and Case 3 series, where the square correlation is 
0.72 (see R2 shown in Figure 10). No meaningful correlation between ki and ߬௕ is observed for Case 1,

((a)~(d) for Case 1~ Case 4).  
4.3 Forward and inverse modeling 
 As shown previously, both the linear and nonlinear models can predict the measured surface 
damping when the “best-fit viscosity”, a constant viscosity chosen to match the surface damping rate, is 
employed (see Figure 5). However, the predicted velocity profiles in the mud layer are not satisfactory 
(see Figure 6). Furthermore, the resulting best-fit viscosity for the linear and nonlinear model may be 
quite different. We observe that the best-fit viscosity associated with the linear model becomes very 
large for cases with low Ursell number (see Table 1). Using the best-fit viscosity to match the 
measured surface damping rate is a common procedure to extract bottom mud properties [e.g., Rogers 
and Holland, 2009], which is in fact an inverse modeling approach. Furthermore, in the present study, 
we obtain measured viscosity e, which provides us an alternative to specify mud viscosity directly 
without a priori information on surface damping. Here, this is called forward modeling. Due to their 
simplicity and popularity, the performance of the constant viscosity models in terms of forward and 
inverse modeling approaches are evaluated here.

Figure 12: Velocity profiles at (a) the wave crest and (b) the flow reversal. (c) Phase-lag for Case 2C 
using best-fit viscosity (solid curves) and measured viscosity (dashed curves). A comparison for 
modeled (nonlinear model) and measured distribution of wave height as waves propagate over the mud 
layer is shown in (d).  
 To summarize the general features of forward modeling, Figure 13 presents the predicted 
damping rate by linear and nonlinear models using the measured viscosity e for a milder wave energy 
series (Cases 2A-F) and a high wave energy series (Cases 4B-F). Both models predict the peak of wave 
dissipation rate at a specific frequency and the results obtained from linear and nonlinear model are 
quite close when Ur<12. Larger differences between linear and nonlinear model results are observed 
when wave nonlinearity (Ur) increases (see Case 2E & Cases 4D-F). Moreover, the differences 
between linear and nonlinear model results become more significant when driving models with 
viscosity smaller than 1.5 Pa.s (not shown). It appears that both wave nonlinearity and non-Newtonian 
rheology influence surface damping. This point will be discussed in more details later. Nevertheless, 
the trend of the predicted damping rate is not consistent with measured data. Using measured viscosity, 
the damping rate is significantly over-predicted for Cases 2 series of smaller wave height. In terms of 
the overall magnitude of damping rate, models predictions agree better with the measured data for Case 
4 series of more energetic wave condition. Based on forward modeling approach, we observed that for 
less energetic condition, models adopting constant viscosity assumption cannot predict the measured 
surface wave damping rate using measured viscosity.

wave-mud interaction. Thus, in order to estimate the relative importance of mud rheology and 
wave-nonlinearity in the wave-mud interaction a full non-Newtonian rheology implementation in a 
fully nonlinear wave model is warranted.

5. Conclusions 
 Measured rheology and concurrent measurements of surface wave damping and velocity in the 
mud layer provide comprehensive data to study the rheological response of mud under various wave 
loading and the resulting wave dissipation. Moreover, linear and nonlinear wave models adopting 
constant viscosity assumption are employed to investigate their capability in modeling wave-mud 
interaction and to evaluate the effect of wave nonlinearity. The measured viscosity in the mud layer, 
derived from measured shear rate and rheological data, is shown to be highly phase-dependent and 
non-Newtonian during the wave passage, especially for less energetic condition. However, wave 
damping rate during more energetic condition can be parameterized by a wave-averaged bottom stress 
and a friction factor, suggesting a good proxy for calculating wave attenuation caused by fluid mud in 
large-scale modeling. Results from forward modeling and backward modeling become more consistent 
during more energetic wave condition (lower bulk viscosity), suggesting that the mud layer behaves 
closer to Newtonian fluid and a constant viscosity become more appropriate when waves become more 
energetic. The difference between linear and nonlinear model results become more significant in less 
energetic wave condition (low Ursell number) indicating that the wave nonlinearity may play an 
important role when mud is more non-Newtonian. Future work utilizing a nonlinear wave model with 
fully non-Newtonian rheology is necessary to quantify the relative importance of mud rheology and 
wave nonlinearity.
