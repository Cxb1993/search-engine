Preface 
 
The results of this project have been published in the Proceedings of the 2ed Asian Pacific 
Conference on Biomechanics (APB 2005). Therefore, rather than adopting the suggested format, 
this report only includes the published material.

 The control goal is find the set of joint activation nodal values and takeoff time tf to maximize 
the objective function J = θ + tair×Htot/Itot for maximal backward somersault rotations. Here θ is 
the angle measured from the vertical axis to the line joining board tip and body centre of mass 
(c.m.) at takeoff; Htot and Itot are the takeoff total angular momentum and moment of inertia about 
body c.m., respectively; tair is flight time determined by diver c.m. vertical velocity at takeoff. 
This means that the objective function depends on the linear and angular positions and velocities 
at the end of board contact. To find the global rather than a local maximum, the downhill simplex 
method [11] with varying initial guesses and re-starting the optimization from newly found 
optimum was employed. 
RESULTS 
 
 Simulations of maximum-rotation jumping with arms (5S) and without arms (4S) at fulcrum = 
5 are compared (Fig. 2). With arm motion, the knees are straighter at takeoff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 2. Comparison of simulated jumps. 
 
 Although joint torque/activation exhibits similar relaxation, minor flexion, full extension, and 
partial extension patterns in 4S and 5S cases, some noticeable differences exist. In 5S, ankle 
extension activation does not remain at its maximum for as long as in the 4S case (Fig. 4). 
Maximum knee torque is larger in 4S. Hip torque remains near its maximum for longer in 5S (Fig. 
3). Hip flexion activation is larger (most negative) in 5S than in 4S, and hip extension activation 
starts earliest and remains full activation for longer in 5S.
