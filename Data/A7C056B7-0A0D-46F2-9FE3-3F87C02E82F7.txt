Abstract 
In this project, the finite element 
method (FEM) and the analytic approach are 
employed to evaluate propagation 
characteristics of surface acoustic waves 
(SAWs) in layered piezoelectric media. The 
extracted coupling-of-mode (COM) 
parameters are then applied in the 
transmission matrix method for the design of 
SAW filters in the high frequency band. In 
the analytic approach, we analyse SAW 
propagation in AlN/128°Y-X LiNbO3 
structures. The effects of the polarity of the 
substrate are also discussed. SAW properties 
and COM parameters of ZnO/diamond 
structures with interdigital transducers (IDTs) 
and /or thin metal films deposited at various 
interfaces are evaluated using the FEM. 
Simulation results using the transmission 
method show that a tailored DMS filter 
applicable for wideband code division 
multiple access (WCDMA) system with a 
high sidelobe suppression of greater than 
40.36 dB, low insertion loss of less than 1.2 
dB, and 3dB bandwidth of 60MHz can be 
achieved. The shape factor is about 1.27 and 
the values of group delay are 0.016-0.06 s.

    本年度計畫選用的壓電材料為鈮酸
鋰、氧化鋅、氮化鋁及鑽石[20, 21]。圖四

構下表面聲波波速，下標 1 與 2 分別表示
128°或52°Y-X 鈮酸鋰壓電材料，當氮化
鋁薄膜厚度(hF / )增加時，表面聲波波速
vf 與 vm會隨之增加，這主要是因為表面聲
波在瑞利波範圍內傳遞時，氮化鋁的表面
聲波速度為 5598 m/s 比 128°或52°Y-X 鈮
酸鋰壓電基板的表面聲波速度為 3994 m/s
高。當 hF / 約為 0.013 時，vf1與 vf2 會趨
近 128°Y-X 鈮酸鋰之慢剪力體聲波速度
4079 m/s，而鈮酸鋰基板曳漏波的解高於
4079 m/s。因此，在 hF / 小於 0.013 時，
128°Y-X 鈮酸鋰所求到的是瑞利波；在 hF 
/ 高於 0.013 時，128°Y-X 鈮酸鋰則求到
曳漏波。

曳漏波的範圍內，K12 具有最大值，但衰減
值卻非常的大[15]。圖五(b)為 SMFT 結構

Abstract—Propagation characteristics of surface acoustic waves 
(SAWs) in IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structures are analyzed in 
this study using the finite element method (FEM). The extracted 
coupling-of-mode (COM) parameters are employed to calculate 
the frequency responses of two-track SAW filters using the 
transmission matrix method. To enhance the sideband 
suppression, Chebyshev function is adopted to modify the 
reflectivity distributions of reflectors, which can be realized 
using width-modulated reflectors. The copper electrode is used 
to retain a sufficiently high reflectivity. Simulation results show 
that a two-track SAW filter applicable for the CDMA system can 
be tailored using IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structures.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Communication devices with designed specifications for 
various applications such as duplexers, IF and RF filters are 
widely used in daily situations. There are several major 
requirements of high-quality IF filter and RF filters as follows. 
First, low insertion loss is required to retain a good signal-to-
noise ratio. Second, shape factor and sidelobe level have to be 
maximally optimized to against the interference from spurious 
signals. Third, the proper frequency control of filters is 
important to prevent overlapping between adjacent channels. 
Furthermore, the group delay has to be constant at the 
passband to avoid phase distortion. In addition, 
communication components with miniature size, high 
integration, rugged structure, and ease of mass production are 
feasible and can be fitted into the state-of-the-art wireless 
communication systems. Surface acoustic wave devices 
(SAWs) are one of several suitable candidates to design IF and 
RF filters for wireless applications [1–4]. 
Code division multiple access (CDMA) system uses spread 
spectrum technology to wider the transmit band, hence, a flatly 
broad passband is ensured signal against distortion. Moreover, 
passband with steep skirt is required to minimally the 
undesired loss. The specifications of a current CDMA IF filter 
including the following: 5dB bandwidth of at least 1.25 MHz, 
an attenuation of more than 30 dB out of 1.8 MHz, and the 
maximum insertion loss of less than 15 dB. In this study, two-
track SAW filters are proposed for CDMA IF filters due to its 
no triple-transit influence (TTI) properties. The detailed 
information about the two-track SAW filters was presented in 
elsewhere [5]. In the two-track SAW filters, the input 
interdigital transducers (IDTs) are out of phase while output 
IDTs are in phase therefore the forward signals will eliminate; 
in other words, the TTI effect can be diminished. This implies 
that the frequency responses of such special configurations are 
mainly dominated by the performances of the reflectors. For a 
uniform reflector, its reflection characteristics, 5dB bandwidth 
and sidelobe suppression cannot meet the specifications for the 
CMDA IF filter. To overcome this problem, some researchers 
employed different window functions to modify the 
reflectivity or line width distributions of reflectors to design IF 
filters [5–7].  
Recently, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices using 
layered structures had been proven to be the mainstream for 
super high frequency applications. SAW operating in the 
second mode in the (100) AlN/diamond structure exhibits 
high phase velocity 10780 m/s and relatively large 
electromechanical coupling coefficient (K2) 2.4% [8]. The 
increase of phase velocity diminishes the line width limitation 
and, hence, improves the feasibility of SAW devices with 
width-modulated reflectors such as double mode SAW (DMS) 
filters, two-track SAW filters, and ladder filters [9-11].  
In this study, width-modulated reflectors with Chebyshev 
distributions in the (100) AlN/diamond structure are 
employed to design the two-track SAW filter applicable to the 
CDMA system. Copper (Cu) IDT is chosen due to its 
reflectivity is two times larger than aluminum (Al) IDT. The 
finite element method (FEM) model is established to calculate 
the mutual-coupling coefficients and effective phase 
velocities of each electrode region with various metallization 
ratios (MRs) and different electrode thicknesses. The 
transmission matrix method is then applied to evaluate the 
frequency responses of two-track SAW filters [5]. 
 
II. METHODOLOGY 
The schematic of a two-track SAW filter on the layered 
piezoelectric structure which consists of an AlN film of 
thickness hF and a diamond substrate is presented in Fig. 1. In 
Fig. 1, input IDTs in both track are identical but out of phase 
while identical output IDTs are in phase, which indicates that 
if there is no reflector in each track, the transmission 
coefficients will vanish and hence the TTI effect can be

To enhance the sidelobe suppression of grating reflectors, 
the Chebyshev function is applied to modulate the reflectivity 
distributions of reflectors. In this study, the number of 
electrode for grating reflectors was assumed to be 240 and the 
sidelobe level (SLL) was 60dB [5]. The generated reflectivity 
distributions with different electrode thicknesses are presented 
in Fig. 5. The maximum value of each reflectivity curve in Fig. 
5 is determined using the FEM as presented in Fig. 4. To 
retain the reflective distribution with a Chebyshev function, 
the MR of each electrode can be obtained numerically from 
Fig. 4 by using an interpolation technique. The MR 
distributions of the reflectors with different electrode 
thicknesses are shown in Fig. 6. And the corresponding 
effective phase velocities calculated using the FEM are also 
presented in Fig. 6.

With given effective phase velocity and reflectivity of each

reflectors calculated using the transmission matrix method are 
plotted in Fig. 7. Note that the period of each electrode has 
been adjusted according to the corresponding effective phase 
velocity such that the operating frequency for each electrode 
is identical. It can be seen that the 1.5% curve has the largest 
bandwidth among all four cases in Fig. 7 but with poorest 
sidelobe suppression level. As shown in Fig. 4 or 5, the 1.5% 
curve has the largest maximum reflectivity among all cases 
studied in this research. This implies that the larger the 
maximum reflectivity, the larger the bandwidth and the poorer 
the sideband suppression. The corresponding transmission 
coefficients of the two-track filter with these width-modulated 
reflectors calculated using the transmission matrix method are 
presented in Fig. 8. For the 0.2, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.5% curves, the

the sidelobe suppression are 50.42, 54.69, 56.3, and 57.46dB, 
respectively. These simulation results can not meet the 
requirements for the CDMA system.

Abstract—The surface acoustic waves (SAWs) propagating in 
interdigital transducer (IDT)/(100) aluminum nitride 
(AlN)/diamond possess the greater phase velocity and coupling 
coefficient than those in IDT/(002) AlN/diamond. In this study, 
the finite element method (FEM) is employed to calculate SAW 
characteristics in these two layered structures with different 
electric interfaces; i.e., IDT/AlN/diamond, AlN/IDT/diamond, 
IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin metal film 
/AlN/IDT/diamond. The effects of Cu and Al electrodes on SAW 
characteristics are illustrated. Simulation results show that the 
Cu IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structure can support a SAW with a 
coupling coefficient of 1.71%, a phase velocity of 9705 m/s, and a 
reflectivity of 0.15, which is applicable for the miniaturized 
wideband and super high band applications.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Increasing demand for communication devices with 
miniaturized components has made the surface acoustic wave 
(SAW) devices widespread used in daily states. There are 
several methods to enhance the characteristics of SAW devices 
for super high frequency applications, including usage of high 
speed piezoelectric materials, leaky SAWs, employment of 
ultrafine electrode by using high-resolution lithography, or 
layered structures combined with high speed material. In the 
case of layered structure, diamond is an attractive non-
piezoelectric material because it possesses the highest acoustic 
wave velocity among all materials. The high frequency SAW 
devices based on diamond are commonly combined with 
piezoelectric films such as aluminum nitride (AlN) or zinc 
oxide (ZnO), which are applicable in the GHz range [1–7]. 
AlN has a SAW velocity of 5600 m/s, which is higher than 
2700 m/s of ZnO. As a result, researchers commonly use AlN 
films on a diamond substrate to acquire low velocity 
dispersion. For (100) AlN/(111) diamond structures, the 
maximum values of coupling coefficient, K2, and associated 
effective phase velocity, veff, are 2.3% and 10500 m/s, 
respectively, where the propagation direction is parallel to the 
c-axis and the a-axis is perpendicular to the diamond surface 
[5]. SAW device in (100) AlN/(111) diamond structure can 
attain a higher phase velocity and a larger coupling coefficient 
than that in (002) AlN/(111) diamond structure [5]. 
In addition to a high phase velocity and large K2, designing 
low-loss and miniature SAW devices such as single phase 
unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs), RF filters and duplexers 
requires a large reflectivity in the interdigital transducers 
(IDTs) [8–15]. For example, Kadota et al. suggested a 
reflection coefficient of 0.15 for designing wideband code 
division multiple access (WCDMA) duplexers [11]. Generally, 
reflectivity depends upon the geometry and material constants 
of the electrode, e.g. its thickness, width, Young’s modulus, 
Poisson’s ratio, and mass density. To noticeably reduce the 
device size with the designed gratings, researches have studied 
the usage of high density metal electrode such as W, Pt, Ta, 
Au, Ta, and Cu in layered structures [14]. For example, Cu 
IDTs provide larger mechanical reflection and smaller electric 
resistance than Al IDTs. Moreover, the sideband suppression 
capability and insertion loss of the filters employing the 
SPUDTs can be improved by using high density metal 
electrode [12]. 
The purpose of this study is to determine the SAW 
characteristics of a diamond layered structure combined with 
either (002) or (100) oriented AlN films by taking the mass 
effects of electrode into consideration. The finite element 
method (FEM) is employed to calculate SAW characteristics in 
four layered structures, including IDT/AlN/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin 
metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond. The effects of Cu and Al 
electrodes are illustrated. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
Figure 1 illustrates the layered structures with various IDT 
and/or thin metal film positions, where hF and hE denote the 
thicknesses of the AlN films and electrode, respectively, p 
represents the electrode pitch, and λ is the wavelength. The 
IDT/AlN/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, and thin metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond 
structures will be denoted hereafter as SFT, SMFT, STF, and 
STFM, respectively, where S stands for the diamond substrate, 
F the AlN film, T the IDT, and M the thin metal film [16].

SFT and SMFT structures with Cu electrode have the 
reflectivity of 0.15 at hE/λ 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively, with an 
associated effective phase velocity of 9705 m/s and 9504 m/s, 
and the K2 of 1.71% and 1.6%. This implies that the Cu 
IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structure is a promising candidate for 
the wideband and super high band applications.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
This study investigates the phase velocities, 
electromechanical coupling coefficients, and reflectivities of 
the second mode of SAW in IDT/AlN/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin 
metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond structures. A reflectivity larger 
than 0.25 can be obtained by using the Cu electrode in 
AlN/diamond layered structures. The coupling coefficient and 
phase velocity decrease as the electrode thickness increases. 
Simulation results show that the Cu IDT/(100) AlN/diamond 
structure can supports a SAW with a coupling coefficient of 
1.71% and a phase velocity of 9705 m/s at hF/λ=0.3 and 
hE/λ=3.4%, and with a reflectivity of 0.15. This information 
will be beneficial in designing the SAW device for super high 
frequency band and wideband applications by using 
AlN/diamond layered structures.

Abstract—Propagation characteristics of surface acoustic waves 
(SAWs) in IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structures are analyzed in 
this study using the finite element method (FEM). The extracted 
coupling-of-mode (COM) parameters are employed to calculate 
the frequency responses of two-track SAW filters using the 
transmission matrix method. To enhance the sideband 
suppression, Chebyshev function is adopted to modify the 
reflectivity distributions of reflectors, which can be realized 
using width-modulated reflectors. The copper electrode is used 
to retain a sufficiently high reflectivity. Simulation results show 
that a two-track SAW filter applicable for the CDMA system can 
be tailored using IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structures.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Communication devices with designed specifications for 
various applications such as duplexers, IF and RF filters are 
widely used in daily situations. There are several major 
requirements of high-quality IF filter and RF filters as follows. 
First, low insertion loss is required to retain a good signal-to-
noise ratio. Second, shape factor and sidelobe level have to be 
maximally optimized to against the interference from spurious 
signals. Third, the proper frequency control of filters is 
important to prevent overlapping between adjacent channels. 
Furthermore, the group delay has to be constant at the 
passband to avoid phase distortion. In addition, 
communication components with miniature size, high 
integration, rugged structure, and ease of mass production are 
feasible and can be fitted into the state-of-the-art wireless 
communication systems. Surface acoustic wave devices 
(SAWs) are one of several suitable candidates to design IF and 
RF filters for wireless applications [1–4]. 
Code division multiple access (CDMA) system uses spread 
spectrum technology to wider the transmit band, hence, a flatly 
broad passband is ensured signal against distortion. Moreover, 
passband with steep skirt is required to minimally the 
undesired loss. The specifications of a current CDMA IF filter 
including the following: 5dB bandwidth of at least 1.25 MHz, 
an attenuation of more than 30 dB out of 1.8 MHz, and the 
maximum insertion loss of less than 15 dB. In this study, two-
track SAW filters are proposed for CDMA IF filters due to its 
no triple-transit influence (TTI) properties. The detailed 
information about the two-track SAW filters was presented in 
elsewhere [5]. In the two-track SAW filters, the input 
interdigital transducers (IDTs) are out of phase while output 
IDTs are in phase therefore the forward signals will eliminate; 
in other words, the TTI effect can be diminished. This implies 
that the frequency responses of such special configurations are 
mainly dominated by the performances of the reflectors. For a 
uniform reflector, its reflection characteristics, 5dB bandwidth 
and sidelobe suppression cannot meet the specifications for the 
CMDA IF filter. To overcome this problem, some researchers 
employed different window functions to modify the 
reflectivity or line width distributions of reflectors to design IF 
filters [5–7].  
Recently, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices using 
layered structures had been proven to be the mainstream for 
super high frequency applications. SAW operating in the 
second mode in the (100) AlN/diamond structure exhibits 
high phase velocity 10780 m/s and relatively large 
electromechanical coupling coefficient (K2) 2.4% [8]. The 
increase of phase velocity diminishes the line width limitation 
and, hence, improves the feasibility of SAW devices with 
width-modulated reflectors such as double mode SAW (DMS) 
filters, two-track SAW filters, and ladder filters [9-11].  
In this study, width-modulated reflectors with Chebyshev 
distributions in the (100) AlN/diamond structure are 
employed to design the two-track SAW filter applicable to the 
CDMA system. Copper (Cu) IDT is chosen due to its 
reflectivity is two times larger than aluminum (Al) IDT. The 
finite element method (FEM) model is established to calculate 
the mutual-coupling coefficients and effective phase 
velocities of each electrode region with various metallization 
ratios (MRs) and different electrode thicknesses. The 
transmission matrix method is then applied to evaluate the 
frequency responses of two-track SAW filters [5]. 
 
II. METHODOLOGY 
The schematic of a two-track SAW filter on the layered 
piezoelectric structure which consists of an AlN film of 
thickness hF and a diamond substrate is presented in Fig. 1. In 
Fig. 1, input IDTs in both track are identical but out of phase 
while identical output IDTs are in phase, which indicates that 
if there is no reflector in each track, the transmission 
coefficients will vanish and hence the TTI effect can be

Figure 4.  Reflectivity and effective phase velocity of an electrode with 
different electrode thickness ratios versus MR.  
To enhance the sidelobe suppression of grating reflectors, 
the Chebyshev function is applied to modulate the reflectivity 
distributions of reflectors. In this study, the number of 
electrode for grating reflectors was assumed to be 240 and the 
sidelobe level (SLL) was 60dB [5]. The generated reflectivity 
distributions with different electrode thicknesses are presented 
in Fig. 5. The maximum value of each reflectivity curve in Fig. 
5 is determined using the FEM as presented in Fig. 4. To 
retain the reflective distribution with a Chebyshev function, 
the MR of each electrode can be obtained numerically from 
Fig. 4 by using an interpolation technique. The MR 
distributions of the reflectors with different electrode 
thicknesses are shown in Fig. 6. And the corresponding 
effective phase velocities calculated using the FEM are also 
presented in Fig. 6.

With given effective phase velocity and reflectivity of each 
electrode, the reflection coefficients of width-modulated 
reflectors calculated using the transmission matrix method are 
plotted in Fig. 7. Note that the period of each electrode has 
been adjusted according to the corresponding effective phase 
velocity such that the operating frequency for each electrode 
is identical. It can be seen that the 1.5% curve has the largest 
bandwidth among all four cases in Fig. 7 but with poorest 
sidelobe suppression level. As shown in Fig. 4 or 5, the 1.5% 
curve has the largest maximum reflectivity among all cases 
studied in this research. This implies that the larger the 
maximum reflectivity, the larger the bandwidth and the poorer 
the sideband suppression. The corresponding transmission 
coefficients of the two-track filter with these width-modulated 
reflectors calculated using the transmission matrix method are 
presented in Fig. 8. For the 0.2, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.5% curves, the 
5dB bandwidth values are 2.65, 1.4, 1.25, and 1.15MHz and 
the sidelobe suppression are 50.42, 54.69, 56.3, and 57.46dB, 
respectively. These simulation results can not meet the 
requirements for the CDMA system.

Abstract—The surface acoustic waves (SAWs) propagating in 
interdigital transducer (IDT)/(100) aluminum nitride 
(AlN)/diamond possess the greater phase velocity and coupling 
coefficient than those in IDT/(002) AlN/diamond. In this study, 
the finite element method (FEM) is employed to calculate SAW 
characteristics in these two layered structures with different 
electric interfaces; i.e., IDT/AlN/diamond, AlN/IDT/diamond, 
IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin metal film 
/AlN/IDT/diamond. The effects of Cu and Al electrodes on SAW 
characteristics are illustrated. Simulation results show that the 
Cu IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structure can support a SAW with a 
coupling coefficient of 1.71%, a phase velocity of 9705 m/s, and a 
reflectivity of 0.15, which is applicable for the miniaturized 
wideband and super high band applications.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Increasing demand for communication devices with 
miniaturized components has made the surface acoustic wave 
(SAW) devices widespread used in daily states. There are 
several methods to enhance the characteristics of SAW devices 
for super high frequency applications, including usage of high 
speed piezoelectric materials, leaky SAWs, employment of 
ultrafine electrode by using high-resolution lithography, or 
layered structures combined with high speed material. In the 
case of layered structure, diamond is an attractive non-
piezoelectric material because it possesses the highest acoustic 
wave velocity among all materials. The high frequency SAW 
devices based on diamond are commonly combined with 
piezoelectric films such as aluminum nitride (AlN) or zinc 
oxide (ZnO), which are applicable in the GHz range [1–7]. 
AlN has a SAW velocity of 5600 m/s, which is higher than 
2700 m/s of ZnO. As a result, researchers commonly use AlN 
films on a diamond substrate to acquire low velocity 
dispersion. For (100) AlN/(111) diamond structures, the 
maximum values of coupling coefficient, K2, and associated 
effective phase velocity, veff, are 2.3% and 10500 m/s, 
respectively, where the propagation direction is parallel to the 
c-axis and the a-axis is perpendicular to the diamond surface 
[5]. SAW device in (100) AlN/(111) diamond structure can 
attain a higher phase velocity and a larger coupling coefficient 
than that in (002) AlN/(111) diamond structure [5]. 
In addition to a high phase velocity and large K2, designing 
low-loss and miniature SAW devices such as single phase 
unidirectional transducers (SPUDTs), RF filters and duplexers 
requires a large reflectivity in the interdigital transducers 
(IDTs) [8–15]. For example, Kadota et al. suggested a 
reflection coefficient of 0.15 for designing wideband code 
division multiple access (WCDMA) duplexers [11]. Generally, 
reflectivity depends upon the geometry and material constants 
of the electrode, e.g. its thickness, width, Young’s modulus, 
Poisson’s ratio, and mass density. To noticeably reduce the 
device size with the designed gratings, researches have studied 
the usage of high density metal electrode such as W, Pt, Ta, 
Au, Ta, and Cu in layered structures [14]. For example, Cu 
IDTs provide larger mechanical reflection and smaller electric 
resistance than Al IDTs. Moreover, the sideband suppression 
capability and insertion loss of the filters employing the 
SPUDTs can be improved by using high density metal 
electrode [12]. 
The purpose of this study is to determine the SAW 
characteristics of a diamond layered structure combined with 
either (002) or (100) oriented AlN films by taking the mass 
effects of electrode into consideration. The finite element 
method (FEM) is employed to calculate SAW characteristics in 
four layered structures, including IDT/AlN/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin 
metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond. The effects of Cu and Al 
electrodes are illustrated. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
Figure 1 illustrates the layered structures with various IDT 
and/or thin metal film positions, where hF and hE denote the 
thicknesses of the AlN films and electrode, respectively, p 
represents the electrode pitch, and λ is the wavelength. The 
IDT/AlN/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, and thin metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond 
structures will be denoted hereafter as SFT, SMFT, STF, and 
STFM, respectively, where S stands for the diamond substrate, 
F the AlN film, T the IDT, and M the thin metal film [16].

SFT and SMFT structures with Cu electrode have the 
reflectivity of 0.15 at hE/λ 3.4% and 3.2%, respectively, with an 
associated effective phase velocity of 9705 m/s and 9504 m/s, 
and the K2 of 1.71% and 1.6%. This implies that the Cu 
IDT/(100) AlN/diamond structure is a promising candidate for 
the wideband and super high band applications.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
This study investigates the phase velocities, 
electromechanical coupling coefficients, and reflectivities of 
the second mode of SAW in IDT/AlN/diamond, 
AlN/IDT/diamond, IDT/AlN/thin metal film/diamond, and thin 
metal film/AlN/IDT/diamond structures. A reflectivity larger 
than 0.25 can be obtained by using the Cu electrode in 
AlN/diamond layered structures. The coupling coefficient and 
phase velocity decrease as the electrode thickness increases. 
Simulation results show that the Cu IDT/(100) AlN/diamond 
structure can supports a SAW with a coupling coefficient of 
1.71% and a phase velocity of 9705 m/s at hF/λ=0.3 and 
hE/λ=3.4%, and with a reflectivity of 0.15. This information 
will be beneficial in designing the SAW device for super high 
frequency band and wideband applications by using 
AlN/diamond layered structures.
