7.04.8 mm2 with its thickness of 290 m. The dimension
of the bismaleimide triazine BT substrate was 5.4 mm in
width, 9.0 mm in length, and 480 m in thickness. The bot-
tom of the BT substrate was maintained at 70 °C and the
convection coefﬁcient was set to be 10 W/m2 °C in a 25 °C
ambient temperature. The intrinsic parameters of materials
used in this simulation can be found in our previous
publication.9 Constant currents, ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 A,
were applied through the two Cu lines on the BT substrate.
The current crowding effect can be relieved to some ex-
tent by increasing the width or the thickness of the Al trace.
In this letter, we designate the crowding ratio to be the maxi-
mum current density inside the solder bump divided by the
average current density in the UBM opening, which was ob-
tained assuming the current spreads uniformly on the UBM
opening. The crowding ratio indicates the degree of nonbal-
ance in the current distribution in the solder bump. It is re-
alized that the current crowding would accelerate the damage
caused by electromigration because of the enhanced wind
force in the current crowding region. Figures 2a–2d dem-
onstrate the cross-sectional views for the current density dis-
tribution of the four models as they were stressed at 0.6 A.
As shown, the local current density inside the solder bump
near the entrance of the Al trace was reduced substantially in
the second and the third model. The crowding ratio for the
ﬁrst model reached a value of 19.8. When the cross section
of the Al trace was increased by 2.9 times, the crowding
ratios were reduced down to 12.0 and 11.7 for the second and
the third model, respectively. Since the geometry of the Al
trace near the solder bump was not varied for the fourth
model, the distribution of current remained the same as the
ﬁrst model. From our simulation, we conclude that increas-
ing the cross section of the Al trace directly reduced the
crowding ratio.
Furthermore, the dimension of the Al trace exerts signiﬁ-
cant effect on Joule heating of the solder bumps. Figures
3a–3d illustrate the temperature distributions in the center
cross sections for the four models when they experience a
stress current of 0.6 A at 70 °C. A hot spot inside the solder
bump was observed near the entrance point of the Al trace
into the solder bump just beneath the passivation opening.
The mean temperature was obtained by averaging the node
temperatures in a 7070 m2 area, as shown in Fig. 3a.
The temperatures in the hot spot were 102.8, 81.7, 83.6, and
90.3 °C for the four models, respectively, whereas the aver-
age temperatures were 97.9, 80.6, 82.0, and 86.1 °C, respec-
tively. It can be seen that the Joule heating effect was greatly
reduced when the cross section of the Al trace was increased.
Figures 4a and 4b show the hot-spot and average tem-
peratures as a function of the applied current up to 0.6 A.
Also, the trend for lower stressing current behaves the same
with smaller magnitude in temperature difference as that
stressed by 0.6 A. Due to the hot spot, a thermal gradient
was built up across the solder bump. The thermal gradient
was derived from the temperature difference between the
hot-spot and the average temperature of the solder close to
the BT side, divided by the bump height. It can be observed
that the second model exhibits the lowest thermal gradient
among the four models.
In general, the Al trace is considered to be the primary
Joule heating source during accelerated electromigration test
as its cross-section area is typically one to two orders of
magnitude less than that of the solder bump and the Cu line.
Under the same applied current, the Joule heating power is
proportional to the total resistance of the stressing circuit.
The resistance of the Al trace for the ﬁrst model was
1331 m, whereas it decreased to 530, 551, 532 m for the
rest of the three models, respectively. Therefore, the Joule
heating effect was less signiﬁcant for the stressing circuit
conﬁguration with smaller total resistance. In addition, for
the third and fourth models, the total resistance and the cross
section for heat dissipation were almost identical, yet there is
still 6.7 °C difference in hot-spot temperature. Since the av-
erage current density in the Al trace for the fourth model was
about three times larger than that for the third model, the
local Joule heat power, which is proportional to the square of
the local current density, is likely to be responsible for the
temperature difference in these two models.
Furthermore, the effect of Al-trace dimension on the
MTTF could be estimated using Eq. 1. For the same solder
joint with different dimensions of the Al traces under the

Effect of three-dimensional current distribution on void formation in ﬂip-chip solder joints during
electromigration was investigated using thermoelectrical coupled modeling, in which the current
and temperature redistributions were coupled and simulated at different stages of void growth.
Simulation results show that a thin underbump metallization of low resistance in the periphery of the
solder joint can serve as a conducting path, leading to void propagation in the periphery of the low
current density region. In addition, the temperature of the solder did not rise signiﬁcantly until 95%
of the contact opening was eclipsed by the propagating void. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

Electromigration has become a critical reliability issue
for high-density solder joints in ﬂip-chip technology.1,2
Electromigration-induced failures and mean time to failure
MTTF of ﬂip-chip joints have been investigated for both
eutectic SnPb and Pb-free solders.3–10 It was found that voids
were formed inside the solder adjacent to the underbump
metallization UBM,4 and propagated along the interface
between the solder and the UBM, causing opening failure of
the joints when the voids eclipsed the entire contact opening.
However, the mechanism of void nucleation and growth and
especially the corresponding change of current distribution in
the solder joint due to void formation are unclear. In particu-
lar, it is unknown why some voids are formed at the periph-
ery of the UBM opening under the dielectric, where the cur-
rent density is low.8,11 In Blech structure of Al stripes, Tu et
al. proposed that resistive vacancy might move to the low
current density region to form voids due to the high gradient
of current density, which was as high as 1010 A/cm3.12 How-
ever, for ﬂip-chip solder joint, the gradient is estimated to be
only 1.33106 A/cm3 owing to its large dimension.8 There-
fore, the growth of voids in the periphery of the UBM open-
ing, which is located at the low current density region, may
not be driven by the gradient of current density. In this letter,
three-dimensional ﬁnite element method was employed to
simulate the effect of void formation on redistribution of
current density and temperature in a ﬂip-chip solder joint,
especially in the periphery area where a low-resistance thin-
ﬁlm UBM exists.
Three-dimensional 3D thermoelectrical coupled simu-
lation was carried out by ﬁnite element analysis to ﬁnd out
the current density and temperature redistributions in our test
samples.13 The model used was a SOLID69 eight-node hexa-
hedral coupled ﬁeld element with ANSYS software. The elec-
trical and thermal resistivities of the materials as well as the
boundary conditions used in this modeling followed those of
our previous study.13 In our samples, the diameters of the
passivation opening and the UBM opening were 85 and
120 m, respectively. Figure 1a shows the cross-sectional
view of the current density distributions before void growth
when 0.28 A was applied to the bump. The Al trace, the
UBM in the chip side, and the metallization in the substrate
were ignored. It was found that the current crowded into the
solder bump in the passivation opening. The current crowd-
ing behavior near the entrance of the Al trace can be clearly
demonstrated. The maximum current density reached 5.42
104 A/cm2, which is about 22 times higher than the aver-
age value. It is proposed that this local high current density
was responsible for the initial void formation due to ﬂux
divergence.4,6 Figure 1b illustrates the temperature distribu-
tion before void formation. The maximum temperature inside
the solder bump was 109.6 °C; therefore, the increase in
temperature due to Joule heating was only 9.6 °C. The tem-
perature was quite uniform inside the bulk of the solder.
In stage I, a semicylindrical void, 45.5 m in diameter
and 13.0 m in height, was formed inside the solder near the
entrance of the Al trace. The current redistributed due to void
formation, and the maximum current density occurred in the
solder near the upper left corner of the periphery of the UBM
opening under the Al trace. As shown in Fig. 2a, void for-

Our simulation also shows that bump resistance in-
creased gradually in the ﬁrst three stages, and then increased
rapidly in the ﬁnal stage, as shown in Table I. Bump resis-
tance was deﬁned as the decrease in voltage between the
entrance point of the Al trace into the Al pad disk and the
junction point of the Cu line with the solder joint. In stage I,
the bump resistance increased from 11.2 to 14.6 m. It in-
creased to 19.0 and 25.3 m in stages II and III, respec-
tively. It rose to 42.9 m in stage IV. This increase in bump
resistance may also enhance the local Joule heating effect.
However, no signiﬁcant local Joule heating was found in the
thermal simulation up to stage IV. This may be attributed to
the fact that the major heating source was the Al trace.14 In
our model, the total resistance of the Al trace was about
1800 m. Consequently, the increase in bump resistance
was quite small compared with that of the Al trace. In addi-
tion, the increase in bump resistance was mainly due to the
following manner: owing to void formation, the current
needed to drift farther in the Al pad disk, and then ﬂowed
down to the solder bump. Therefore, the local Joule heating
in the Al pad disk increased when voids were formed.
Since there was good heat dissipation in the Si side, the
increase in temperature due to void formation was quite
small. Nevertheless, the increase might be higher when
larger current was applied, since the overall Joule heating
would be signiﬁcantly higher at higher stressing current.
In summary, we have employed the 3D ﬁnite element
method to simulate the current and temperature redistribu-
tions due to the formation and propagation of a pancake-
shape void in solder joints during electromigration. It is pro-
posed that current redistribution is the main reason
accounting for void formation and propagation, especially
the propagation into the low current density region below the
contact passivation. It is found that UBM provided a con-
ducting path for current to go below the passivation, and it
directed the current to the periphery of the solder joint,
which is in agreement with the experimental observation of
void formation in those regions. Increase in temperature due
to void formation was not signiﬁcant since the major heat
source was the Al trace and the applied current was as low as
0.28 A.

of the Si chip was 10.0 mm6.0 mm and the thickness was
290 m, whereas the bismaleimide triazine BT substrate
was 4.75 mm wide, 7 mm long, and 350 m thick.
Before the current stressing, calibration was performed
on a hot plate maintained at 70 °C. The temperature distri-
bution without current stressing is shown in Fig. 1a. The
circuit of the Al trace can barely be seen since the Si sub-
strate is transparent to IR radiation. Figure 1b shows the
temperature increase for the Al trace in the package when
stressed by 0.59 A at the ambient temperature of 70 °C. The
current path is indicated by two of the arrows in the ﬁgure.
There were two solder bumps located directly below the two
circular Al pads/UBMs, as labeled in the ﬁgure. It is note-
worthy that the Al trace has much higher temperature than
the circular Al pads, which were directly connected to the
UBM and the solder bumps. The maximum temperature was
as high as 134 °C, which occurred approximately at the
middle of the Al trace, whereas the temperature was only
about 105 °C for the Al pads above the solder bumps. The
inner circle of the Al pad in Fig. 1b represents the passiva-
tion opening, whereas the outer circle corresponds to the
UBM opening of the solder joint.
Furthermore, whether a hot spot exists inside the solder
is of interest for electromigration study. Figure 1c illus-
trates the temperature proﬁle along the 75 m long dashed
line in Fig. 1b. The points A and B in Fig. 1b represent
the edges of the UBM and the passivation openings, respec-

mately 118.2 °C and 109.7 °C, respectively, which are much
higher than the average temperature of 105.2 °C in the Al
pad. The average temperature was calculated by averaging
the temperatures in a 10 m10 m square in the center of
the passivation opening. In addition, there is a thermal gra-
dient since the temperature at the Al pad near the entrance of
the Al trace was higher than that at the opposite end. The
gradient in this junction was as high as 1700 °C/cm.

The critical length of eutectic SnPb solder was investigated using solder stripes. By employing focus
ion beam, solder stripes of various lengths, including 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 100, and 200 m, can be
fabricated. Length-dependent electromigration behavior was observed, which implies that there may
be back stress under stressing. The critical length was determined to be between 10 and 15 m
under stressing by 2104 A/cm2 at 100 °C, and the corresponding critical product was between 20
and 30 A/cm. Both values show good agreement with their theoretical values. © 2006 American

With the portable devices becoming smaller and more
compact in size, ﬂip-chip technology has been adopted for
ﬁne-pitch packaging in microelectronics industry.1 Area ar-
ray of tiny solder joints can be fabricated on Si chips to
achieve high-density packaging. In addition, as the required
performance continues to increase, the input/output I/O pin
count of ﬂip-chip products has dramatically increased and
the current that each bump needs to carry continues to in-
crease, resulting in higher current density ﬂowing in each
solder bump. Therefore, electromigration EM has become
an important reliability issue in solder joints.2–4
A lot of research has been done on electromigration of
solder joints. However, only a few studies have been focused
on the measurement of fundamental electromigration param-
eters of solder. Liu et al. found that the dominant diffusion
species was Sn atoms in a thin SnPb stripe when stressed at
room temperature.5 Huynh et al. conducted another elec-
tromigration study at 150 °C using V-groove samples, and
found that Pb atoms were the dominant diffusion species.6
Yeh et al. used Blech structure to measure the threshold cur-
rent density.7 However, one of the fundamental parameters of
electromigration, the critical length, has not been measured
experimentally. The critical length represents the stripe
length below which there was no electromigration damage
due to balanced back stress.8 The critical length for the Al
and Cu lines has been investigated, from which an very im-
portant parameter, critical product, can be obtained.8,9 The
critical length of solder has not been measured because it is
very difﬁcult to prepare short solder stripes. In this letter, we
report a technique that is capable of fabricating solder stripes
with various lengths down to a few microns. Therefore, the
critical length for solder can be obtained experimentally.
In general, the mass transport by electromigration in
Blech specimens is governed by the following equation:8,10
J =
CD
kT
Z*eE −
CD
kT
d
dx
, 1
where J is the net electromigration ﬂux, C is the atomic
concentration per unit volume, D is the diffusivity, Z* is the
effective charge number, E is the electric ﬁeld, k is Boltz-
mann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature,  is the
hydrostatic stress in the metal, and  is the atomic volume.
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the equation repre-
sents the ﬂux due to electromigration, whereas the second
term stands for the opposite ﬂux due to back stress.10 Under
the same current density, the shorter the stripe is, the higher
the back stress will be. Back stress increases with decreasing
stripe length due to higher stress gradient. At the critical
length, the stress balances with the wind force, and thus there
is no net electromigration ﬂux. If we assume that −d /dx is
equal to c /Lc, the critical length can thus be expressed as
Lc =
c
Z*eE
=
c
Z*ej , 2
where c is the stress at the critical length, Lc is the critical
length, j is the applied current density, and  is the resistivity
of the stripe.
To investigate the critical length of solder, short Blech
stripes down to a few micrometers need to be fabricated. We
have reported a technique for fabricating solder Blech stripes
of 370 m long in a Si trench.7 Nevertheless, it is quite
challenging to fabricate short solder stripes because it is very
difﬁcult to reﬂow the solder on underbump metallization
UBM of less than 20 m long. In addition, the thickness of
the solder stripe was not uniform at both ends, since the two
ends were thinner due to reﬂow and polishing process. To
overcome these problems, focus ion beam FIB was em-
ployed to fabricate short stripes from the 370-m-long sol-
der stripe. Figure 1a shows the SnPb stripe of 370 m long
fabricated using our previous approach. The stripe was
80 m wide and 2.1 m thick. FIB was used to etch away
part of the stripe, and desired lengths of solder stripes can
thus be fabricated on a Blech specimen. Figure 1b shows
the stripes with abrupt edges fabricated by the above tech-
nique. The FIB etched away three solder slices of 80
10 m2 at the desired positions. Various lengths, including
10, 30, 100, and 200 m, can be fabricated on a Blech speci-
men. Figure 1c shows the tilt-view scanning electron mi-
croscopy SEM image for one of the surfaces after the FIB
etching. The solder layer was almost etched away and it
became discontinuous. The intermetallic compounds IMCs
below the solder were also etched slightly, but it was still
continuous. They might not migrate during the electromigra-
tion test, because Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs have higher melt-
ing point and higher elastic modulus. They were expected to

mental value. The corresponding value of critical product is
22 A/cm.
It is estimated that the current density required to cause
failure in a solder joint is about two orders of magnitude less
than that needed for an Al or Cu line to fail.3 Electromigra-
tion in a ﬂip-chip solder joint occurs at lower current density
because of the high lattice diffusivity in the solder alloys,
together with higher resistivity, lower Young’s modulus, and
higher effective charge number of the chemical elements in
solder alloys than those of Al or Cu. The critical product is
1260 A/cm for a 115 m Al stripe at 350 °C,8 whereas it is
3700 A/cm at 340–400 °C for dual-damascene Cu/oxide
interconnects.9 These values are about 50–150 times larger
than those obtained in our experiment. Therefore, the critical
product we measured is quite reasonable.
Signiﬁcant phase redistribution was observed after cur-
rent stressing for stripes longer than 15 m, as shown in Fig.
4. The Pb-rich phase migrated toward the anode end, and
thus Pb atoms were found to be the dominate diffusion spe-
cies at 100 °C. This phase redistribution may have effect on
the back stress. In addition, after stressing for a long time,
the Pb-rich phase accumulated on the anode end, leaving the
Sn-rich phase on the cathode end. This redistribution also
affects the yield stresses on the cathode and the anode ends.
Further study is needed to address these issues.
In conclusion, eutectic SnPb solder stripes of various
lengths have been fabricated using FIB. It is found that no
electromigration damage occurred for the 5 and 10 m
stripes under stressing by the current density of 2
104 A/cm2 at 100 °C for 490 h, whereas length-
dependent electromigration behavior was observed for
longer stripes. The critical length was between 10 and
15 m, which is quite close to the theoretical value of
11 m. The corresponding critical product was between 20
and 30 A/cm, which is approximately two orders of magni-
tude smaller than that of the dual-damascene Cu/oxide inter-
connects.

tions UBM was 0.5 m Ti/0.5 m Cu/5 m Cu/3 m
Ni. The Ti layer and the 0.5 m Cu seed layer were sput-
tered, whereas the 5 m Cu and the 3 m Ni layers were
electroplated. The passivation and UBM openings were 110
and 125 m in diameter, respectively. Eutectic SnPb solder
was used for the joint. The dimension of the pad opening was
280 m in diameter. Owing to the large opening in the sub-
strate side, the bump height was as small as 25 m. Our
previous simulation results showed that current crowding ef-
fect occurred within 20 m depth in solder bump near the
entrance of the electron ﬂows on the chip side.17 Therefore, it
is expected that mechanism of void formation for these low-
bump-height joints should be quite similar to those with nor-
mal bump height of about 100 m.
3D simulation was performed to examine the change in
bump resistance due to void formation. The morphology of
Ni3Sn4 intermetallic compound IMC was assumed to be of
layered type with uniform thickness of 1.0 m, as shown in
Fig. 1b. The resistivity values of the materials used in this
simulation are listed in Table I. ANSYS simulation software
was employed and the model used in this study was SOLID5
eight-node hexahedral coupled ﬁeld element.
The increase in bump resistance during electromigration
can be precisely measured using Kelvin bump probes, and it
can be employed to monitor the void formation and micro-
structure change during electromigration. Figure 2a shows
the total resistance for the stressing circuit as a function of
stressing time up to failure when powered by 0.8 A at
150 °C. The initial resistance was 1.77 , and no obvious
increase in resistance could be observed until 90% of the
stressing time. Yet, the enlarged curve up to 80% of the
failure time shows that the total resistance decreased initially,
and then increased with stressing time, as illustrated in the
inset of Fig. 2a. The decrease in total resistance may be
attributed to the reduction in contact resistance of the whole
stressing circuit. The total resistance increased about 30 m
after stressing for 80% of the failure time. This resistance
increase may be mainly due to the degradation or oxidation
of Cu lines in the FR4 substrate and of the Cu wires used to
connect the package to the power supply during current
stressing, since no obvious resistance increase was detected
in the Al trace between bumps 2 and 3. In addition, the noise
of the resistance curve was about 5–10 m. The noise may
be mainly attributed to the temperature coefﬁcient of resis-
tance TCR. If we take the average TCR value for the stress-
ing circuit to be 410−3 K−1, the ﬂuctuation in resistance in
the stressing circuit would be 7 m /deg. However, the
bump resistance measured by Kelvin bump probes showed a
different behavior. This can be seen in Fig. 2b, which
shows the measured resistance of bump 3 up to failure. The
initial bump resistance was only 0.6 m. As the stressing
time increased, the bump resistance continued to increase
slowly up to 80% of failure time, and the bump failed when
the resistance rose abruptly at around 756.6 h. The inset in
Fig. 2b shows the data in 2b up to 80% of the stressing
time. The bump resistance started to increase after 20 h. The
time for the resistance to reach 1.03 times of the initial value
was 29.8 h, which was 4% of the failure time. Voids may
start to form at this stage, and we will discuss this point
below. In contrast to the results from the daisy-chain struc-
ture, this technique can detect the subtle change in bump
resistance. This is because the total resistance of the daisy-
chain circuit was in the order of several ohms and noise in
resistance due to TCR effect was over 7 m,2 whereas the
increase in resistance in the initial stage of void formation is
less than 1 m. Therefore, the noise in the total resistance
makes it difﬁcult for the daisy-chain structure to detect the
slight change in resistance due to void formation.
The initial bump resistance was only 0.6 m measured
at 0.8 A at 150 °C, which was much lower than expected.
Two reasons may be responsible for this low bump resis-
tance. First, the bump height was only 25 m, which was
about a quarter of the typical value. Second, the Kelvin
probes for measuring voltage drop were located in a low
current density region of the Al pad. Our previous 3D simu-
lation showed that the current did not spread uniformly in the
UBM opening, instead the current crowded into the solder
bump in a small volume near the entrance point of the Al
trace.17 Since only a small amount of the current passed
through the opposite end of the entrance point of the current,
the voltage drop measured by the Kelvin probes was lower
than expected.
The Kelvin probes can detect different stages of void
formation and propagation, and Figs. 3a–3c show the
void formation at different stages. Figure 3a shows the
cross-sectional scanning electron microscope SEM image

Three-dimensional simulations for relieving the current crowding effect in solder joints
under current stressing were carried out using the finite element method. Three
possible approaches were examined in this study, including varying the size of the
passivation opening, increasing the thickness of Cu underbump metallization (UBM),
and adopting or inserting a thin highly resistive UBM layer. It was found that the
current crowding effect in the solder bump could be successfully relieved with the
thick Cu UBM or with the highly resistive UBM. Compared to the solder joint with
Al/Ni(V)/Cu UBM, for instance, the maximum current density in a solder bump
decreased dramatically by a factor of fifteen, say from 1.11 × 105 A/cm2 to 7.54 ×
103 A/cm2 when a 20-m-thick Cu UBM was used. It could be lowered by a factor of
seven, say to 1.55 × 104 A/cm2, when a 0.7-m UBM of 14770  cm was adopted.
It is worth noting that although a resistive UBM layer was used, the penalty on overall
resistance increase was negligible because the total resistance was dominated by the Al
trace instead of the solder bump. Thermal simulation showed that the average
temperature increase due to Joule heating effect was only 2.8 °C when the solder joints
with UBM of 14770  cm were applied by 0.2 A.
I. INTRODUCTION
The flip-chip solder joint has become the most impor-
tant technology of high-density packaging in the micro-
electronics industry.1 Thousands of solder bumps can be
fabricated into one chip. To meet performance require-
ments, the input/output (I/O) numbers keep increasing,
and the size of the joints progressively shrinks. Their
diameter is about 100 m or less.2 The design rule of
packaging requires that each bump is to carry 0.2–0.4 A,
resulting in a current density of approximately 2 × 103
to 2 × 104 A/cm2. Therefore, electromigration has be-
come an important reliability issue for flip-chip solder
joints.3–5
In this work, current density distribution in a solder
joint was thoroughly studied by a three-dimensional fi-
nite element simulation. It was found that the maximum
current density in a solder bump can be much higher than
the average one that was previously projected. It locates
itself near the solder/underbump metallization (UBM)
interface, which serves as a vacancy flux divergence
plane and favors electromigration occurring at that loca-
tion. Consequently, the solder joint is more prone to elec-
tromigration. The cause of such locally high current den-
sity is a result of the current crowding effect. Current
crowding occurring in the solder joints is due to the
current flow experiencing a dramatic geometrical and
resistance transition from the thin on-chip metal line to
the solder bump. Because the cross-section of the Al
trace on the chip side is about two orders smaller than
that of the solder joints, the majority of the current will
tend to gather near the Al/UBM entrance point to enter
the solder bump instead of spreading uniformly across
the opening before entering the bump. The materials near
the entrance point experience a current density of about
one order of magnitude higher than the average value.
The materials included a bump metallization (UBM), in-
termetallic compound (IMC), and solder, where the

plays a critical role in the electromigration failure of the
solder joints.10
Hence, increasing the electromigration resistance of
the joints is an important and urgent issue. There are two
approaches to increasing electromigration resistance:
first, using a solder alloy that has better electromigration
resistance; second, relieving the current crowding effect
in solder joints by proper circuit or UBM design. For the
former approach, Wu et al. developed a Pb-free solder
alloy that has excellent electromigration resistance, close
to that of the high-Pb solder.11 For the latter approach, it
is expected that relieving the current crowding effect in
solder joints would retard the formation rate of the voids
and thus would increase the lifetime of the solder joints.
However, no literature related to this issue has been
reported so far. For this paper, we used finite element
analysis to simulate the current density distribution of the
solder joints with various structures of flip-chip solder
joints. Possible solutions for the relieving current crowd-
ing effect will be proposed.

solder bump. The cross-sectional view of Fig. 2(a) along
the Z-axis is shown in Fig. 2(b). The current crowding
effect can be clearly seen at the entrance of the Al trace.
The maximum current density inside the solder is 1.11 ×
105 A/cm2. In this paper, to evaluate the current crowding
effect, we denote a “crowding ratio” as the local maxi-
mum current density divided by the average current den-
sity at the UBM opening. The average current density at
the UBM opening is 5.01 × 103 A/cm2 for the standard
simulation model. Therefore, the corresponding crowd-
ing ratio for the solder near the entrance is 22.2, which
means that the local current density at the solder bump
near the Al entrance is 22.2 times larger than the average
value at the UBM opening. The larger the value is, the
higher the current crowding effect.
To examine the current density distribution in various
locations of the joint, six cross-sections were inspected.
Their locations are shown in Fig. 2(b), in which cross-
section Y1 is located inside the UBM layer, cross-section
Y2 represents the IMC layer, cross-section Y3 is located
in the top layer of the solder joint connecting to the IMC,
and cross-section Y4 is situated near the middle of the
solder joint, which has the largest cross-section 184 m
in diameter. Cross-section Y5 is situated between the
middle and the bottom of the solder, which has a necking
due to the necessity of there being a solder mask, and
cross-section Y6 represents the bottom of the solder joint
close to the Ni3Sn4 IMC on the substrate side.
The current density distributions at the six cross sec-
tions are shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(f). The current density
distribution in the UBM layer is shown in Fig. 3(a), in
which the maximum current density occurs near the Al
entrance inside the passivation opening. The value
reaches 2.09 × 105 A/cm2, and its crowding ratio is as
high as 41.9. For the IMC layer shown in Fig. 3(b), the
maximum value is 1.81 × 105 A/cm2, and the correspond-
ing crowding ratio is 36.2. The maximum current density
inside the solder occurs near the Al entrance inside the
passivation opening, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The value
reaches 1.11 × 105 A/cm2, and its crowding ratio remains
as high as 22.2. For the remaining three layers, as shown
in Figs. 3(d)–3(f), current distribution became more
uniform, and thus the crowding ratios for the three
layers were 0.7, 1.5, and 1.2, respectively. Therefore,
changing the angle between the Al trace and the Cu
conductor may not be able to alter the current density
distribution. These results agreed with the thermal simu-
lation results conducted by Lee et al.13 The maximum
current density and the crowding ratios at different cross
sections for the solder joint are listed in Table II. Since
the top-layer of the solder (Y3 plane) is the most vulner-
able location during current stressing, we will examine
the current density distribution on this layer for the fol-
lowing models that aim to relieve the current crowding
effect.

axis for (a) 0.7-m Cu UBM, (b) 5-m Cu UBM, and (c) 20-m Cu

Table III lists the maximum current density and the cor-
responding crowding ratio at cross sections Y1 to Y6 for
this model. Hence, solder bumps with larger passivation
opening have no effect on relieving the current crowding
effect.
B. Effect of UBM thickness
To examine the effect of UBM thickness on the dis-
tribution of current density, three thicknesses of Cu UBM
were simulated, including 0.7, 5, and 20 m.
Figures 5(a)–5(c) show the 3D distribution of current
density in the solder joints for the three models, respec-
tively. Although serious current crowding still occurs
near the entrance of the Al trace for the three models, the
solder bump is moved away from the crowding site due
to the thicker UBM. The net effect is a lower maximum
current density in the solder joint, and the current density
inside the solder becomes more uniform. The maximum
current density and the corresponding crowding ratio at
cross sections Y1 to Y6 for the three models are listed in
Table IV. The maximum current densities in the top layer
of the solder are 1.17 × 105, 4.37 × 104, and 7.54 ×
103 A/cm2, respectively. It was surprising that the value
dramatically decreased to 7.54 × 103 A/cm2 for the solder
joint with 20-m Cu UBM, which corresponds to a low
crowding ratio of 1.5. Thus, the current crowding effect
inside the solder bump was effectively relieved by add-
ing a thick UBM, that is, by moving the UBM/solder
interface away from the current crowding region.
C. Effect of UBM resistivity
The best method of suppressing the current crowding
effect in this study was to use a resistive UBM layer. In
this simulation, we simulated four solder joints with 295,
1477, 2954, and 14770  cm, which corresponded to
10, 50, 100, and 500 times the UBM resistivity of the
standard model. Figures 6(a)–6(d) show the 3D distribu-
tion of current density in the solder joint for the four
models. It was found that the current density redistrib-
uted in the contact opening. With the increase in UBM
resistivity, a greater amount of current traveled further
along the Al pad before flowing down into the contact
opening. In addition, the current density distribution in
the top layer of the solder became more uniform as UBM
resistivity increased. Figure 7 shows the current density
distribution inside the top layer of the solder along the Z
axis. The current became uniformly distributed inside the
solder layer, and maximum current densities ranged from
7.01 to 1.55 × 104 A/cm2. The corresponding crowding
ratios are 14.0, 7.4, 5.4, and 3.1 for the solder joint with
UBM resistivities of 295, 1477, 2954, and 14770  cm,
respectively, as listed in Table V. Furthermore, the cur-
rent distribution in the UBM, IMC layers, and solder
bump also became more uniform when highly resistive
UBM layers were used.
Because the insertion of the resistive layers may in-
crease the bump resistance and thus cause higher Joule
heating in the solder joints, thermal simulation was per-
formed to examine temperature distribution in the above

that there is no effect on relieving current crowding by
the enlargement of the passivation opening, as shown in
Fig. 9(a). A thicker Cu UBM can relieve current crowd-
ing in the solder bump by moving the UBM/solder in-
terface away from the current crowding region, as seen in
Fig. 9(b). The thicker the UBM is, the less the current
crowding effect. Figure 9(c) shows that the crowding ra-
tios in the solder joint can be lowered to 3.1 through use
of more resistant UBM. This UBM layer can suppress
current crowding at the UBM/solder interface.
The best methods for relieving the current crowding
effect inside the solder bump fall into two categories:
(i) moving the UBM/solder interface away from the cur-
rent crowding region, and (ii) suppressing current crowd-
ing at the UBM/solder interface. If the UBM/solder in-
terface can be moved away from the current crowding
region, the threat from the high current density can be
avoided. As shown in Figs. 6(a)–6(c), one can clearly see
that the current density drops very rapidly when it is
moved way from the chip side. Therefore, if one in-
creases the thickness of UBM, the current crowding re-
gion will locate within the UBM, and therefore, the
UBM/solder interface will be further away from it. Thick
Cu UBM has been adopted for use in the flip-chip solder
joints.14 Thus, it is expected the joints would have better
electromigration resistance.
To suppress the current crowding effect, the best sce-
nario would be to have the current flowing though the
whole solder uniformly. To achieve this goal, increasing
the resistivity of UBM would be the best method. Our
simulation shows that the current crowding ratio can be
reduced to 3.1 when the UBM resistivity is increased to
4770  cm. However, the tradeoff is the increase in the
resistance of the solder joint. The vertical resistance of
the standard model was estimated to be 1.2 m. The total
resistances of the solder joint became 1.4, 2.1, 3.0, and
10.3 m for the solder joints with a UBM resistivity of
295, 1477, 2954, and 14770  cm, respectively. This
resistive layer could be a TiN, TaN, or Ta material, and
could be deposited with UBM, or it could be an addi-
tional layer between the Al pad and the UBM. Further-
more, our thermal simulation shows that the Joule heat-
ing effect due to the resistive layers was less than 0.6 °C
when the applied current was less than 0.2 A. Therefore,
the insertion of the resistive layers could relieve current
crowding effect significantly and cause very small Joule
heating effect at low applied current. Nevertheless, it is
still unknown if it is compatible with the current flip-chip
manufacturing process, and thus it requires further ex-
perimental study.
Furthermore, one can use the hybrid of the above ap-
proaches to relieve the current crowding effect. If one
adopts the highly resistant layer to relieve the current
crowding effect, increasing the cross-section of the pas-
sivation opening would have a further effect in reducing
the maximum current density in the solder bump. When
the model in Sec. III. B is used with a larger passivation
opening and the high resistivity UBM of 14770  cm
is adopted, the maximum current density can be further
reduced down from 1.6 × 104 to 1.3 × 104 A/cm2.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A three-dimensional simulation was used to demon-
strate that current crowding in the solder joints can be
successfully suppressed either by thick Cu UBM or a
highly resistive UBM layer. The crowding ratio in the

thickness, and (c) effect of UBM resistance. It shows that the current
crowding effect can be successfully relieved in the solder joints with
a thick Cu UBM or with the highly resistive UBM.
