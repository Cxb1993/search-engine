Mitani and Suzuni first proposed an automatic papercraft design 
method based on the triangle strip decomposition [1]. They based 
on the concept that a triangle strip is always developable to 
achieve the papercraft goal. By decomposing the 3D mesh into 
several ribbon regions, and then simplifies each of the ribbon 
region into single triangle strip using QEM [11], the 3D mesh is 
decomposed into several developable patches. And these patches 
can be easily reconstructed back to 3D model. Although the 
triangle strips can be reconstructed correctly, the difference 
between the original mesh and reconstructed model cannot be 
controlled. Julius et al. proposed a quasi-developable mesh 
decomposition method based on the conic surface equation [2]. 
They derived a developability metric by simplifying the conic 
surface equation, and was used to grow the mesh patches. Their 
work did not guarantee that the generated patches satisfy the 
developable condition, which may not suitable to be used on 
material such as paper. Shatz et al. proposed a papercraft design 
method based on the same concept [3]. Their patches were 
formulated by the conic surface, which guaranteed to be 
developable, and measure the distance between the conic surface 
and the original mesh. A boundary optimization process was 
performed to ensure that the patch boundary can be matched. 
 
3. Papercraft Parameterization 
We propose a papercraft design scheme using the mesh 
parameterization approach. Three steps are involved in this 
scheme. First, the boundary of 3D mesh is embedded into the 2D 
domain with the edge length as the constraint. The internal 
vertices are flattened into the 2D domain using the least square 
conformal mapping [14]. Then, the triangle distortion between 
mapping is measured. The vertices which have local maximum 
distortion value are identified, and the minimum spanning tree is 
generated to connect these vertices. A cutting process is 
performed along the minimum spanning tree to reduce the 
distortion and then re-parameterize the boundary loop and the 
internal vertices. This procedure is executed iteratively until the 
distortion of all triangles below the given threshold. Figure 1 
illustrates the flowchart of the proposed method. 
 
3.1 Boundary Parameterization 
The boundary shape after embedded into 2D domain should be 
close to the 3D mesh boundary to reduce the distortion. Also, to 
prevent from crevices after reconstruction due to the inconsistency 
of boundary length, the boundary length should be constrained 
during parameterization. 
The boundary parameterization can be formulated as a constrained 
optimization problem, which minimize the angle difference 
between the 3D original boundary and the 2D parameterized 
boundary, while retains the edge length as constraint. The 
objective function is the sum of angle differences between 3D 
boundary and the 2D boundary, which reveals in Eq. 1

where F(β) is the objective function, and ai is the total angle of 
boundary vertex i on the 3D boundary, and βi is the angle in 2D 
boundary loop. The constraints for the optimization problem are 
listed  in Eq. 2 as [12]

In Eq. 2, ei is the length of edge start from vertex i, and ai and βi 
are the same as in Eq. 1. The g(1) and g(2) in Eq. 2 are the edge 
length constraints which derived from the property of 
trigonometric function. The g(3) is the angle constraint for simple 
polygon. 
Such equations form a standard constrained least-square problem, 
and can be solved using numerical optimization tools. 
  
3.2 Internal Parameterization 
The internal parameterization embeds all internal vertices into the 
2D domain with the boundary constraint. Since we wish the 
parameterization to be conformal, and the boundary loop may not 
be convex after the boundary parameterization, we use the least

We have proposed a papercraft modeling scheme using the 
parameterization approach. With the boundary length as constraint, 
the developability of mesh can be ensured, and the similarity 
between the crafted model and the original 3D mesh can be 
measured by the mapping error during parameterization. Also, the 
cutting scheme is used to reduce the mapping error to increase the 
similarity. With this approach, no additional patch is created, and 
helps the process of crafting the flattened model into 3D. Also, the 
dissimilarity between the crafted model and the original one can 
be measured by the parameterization error.

Due to the poor performance of Matlab optimization toolbox, we 
can flatten models which have few polygon count only. Since the 
constrained least square problem is quite popular and have various 
solver better than Matlab, we are focusing on finding a better 
optimization scheme instead of Matlab. The error metric proposed 
by Sander et al. [] measures the area and shape distortion between 
mapping, which does not take the developability information into 
account. We will try to integrate the developability into the error 
metric for generating more reasonable parameterization result. 
Furthermore, we cut the mesh according to the distance from the 
mesh boundary, a better way is to cut the mesh along the crease 
edges, which yields more nature cuts along the mesh. To achieve 
such goal, an analysis on mesh to find the visually meaningful 
crease edges is necessary. We are also interesting on such 
problem.

未來研究規劃 
此段訪問期間與馬教授多次討論有關未來研究合作的規劃，目前進行下列兩項的研究。這些
研究將由我及學生進行，過程中將與馬教授密切討論。 
1. Multi-resolution Texture-based Feature Tracking in Large Time-varying Volume Visualization 
由於科學模擬及醫學影像擷取技術的進步，越來越多複雜的大型時變容積資料產生，如何
有效並正確的顯示資料間的訊息，變成很重要的課題。一般來說，時變資料包括了數百個
時間區間(time step)，而在這些時間中，有許多科學家期望觀察、研究、比對的資訊，我們
稱之為特徵。這些特徵在時間的變動中，通常會以不同速率、不同方向、不同的方式在資
料中呈現，萃取並追蹤這些特徵的方法，成為我們需要解決的問題。 此次研究，我們希望
能夠結合多層次解析度架構及基於貼圖資訊的特徵追蹤演算法，期望能夠達到即時互動的
顯像速度，並且輔以使用者介面的設計，讓使用者能夠介入參數的設定，以提高顯像節點
的多層次精細度(level-of-detail)自動選擇及特徵追蹤的正確性。 主要貢獻會在於提出即時
互動的特徵追蹤演算法，半自動追蹤使用者想要觀察的特徵，使用者能夠邊觀察邊修改特
徵參數，並且達到良好的顯示品質。
