matching activator feed rate of 120 ml/min, the 
specific surface  
area  can  reach  about  1000m2/g,  producing  an  
adsorption  ratio  
of carbon tetrachloride over 200%. 
 
and show that, given a relatively low corresponding pressure 
(0.0~0.2), the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms showed 
a rapid increase, indicating that the sample has a good 
adsorption capacity. When the pressure is set between 0.2~0.8, 
the middle isotherm is particularly level; as the pressure (P/P0) 
approaches 1, the isotherm takes on a slow upward curve. 
According to BDDT classification, the nitrogen 
adsorption/desorption isotherm is inferred to be closer to Type I, 
indicating the carbon nanofiber adsorbent’s pores are mostly 
micro pores. A production rate of 10 cm/min results in the 
greatest amount of nitrogen adsorption. While a production rate 
of 40 cm/min results in the lowest nitrogen 
adsorption/desorption isotherm. In addition, at a production rate 
of 10 cm/min with different activator levels corresponding to 
pressure range of 0.4~0.8, the desorption/adsorption isotherms 
produce inconsistencies known as the hysteresis loop. This 
phenomenon indicates an increase in the number of mesopores 
in the samples and that the samples have been over-activated. 
Following IUPAC classification, the hysteresis loop is an H4 
type. Within this range P/P0, the desorption/adsorption isotherm 
remains level and they remain parallel through a wide pressure 
range. McBain pointed out that the sample pores would form an 
ink bottleneck. In investigating the adsorption/desorption 
phenomenon, and assuming that the narrow entrance is the 
bottleneck, the mesopores structure normally results in 
capillary condensation, which indicates that the raw material 
has been over-activated. It can also be inferred that a slower 
production rate corresponds to a greater volume of pores 
produced. 
1.2 Activator Flow Rate 
In experiments, activator flow rate was set at 80, 120 and 160 
ml/min, as seen in Figs. 4-7. Given similar production rates, 
higher activator flow rate raised the nitrogen 
adsorption/desorption isotherms. With an activator flow rate of 
120 ml/min, the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were 
higher than under the other two conditions. At 120 ml/min, the 
activator (water) completely evaporated, filling the 
high-temperature furnace and the fibers’ interior, resulting in a 
reaction which produced pores. When the activator flow rate 
was raised to 160 ml/min, the untimely vaporized water is 
easily condensed on the material surface, and the water 
molecules produce a simultaneous vaporization reaction, that is, 
the samples were over-activated, resulting in the entire nitrogen 
adsorption/desorption isotherms falling significantly. 
 
2. Specific Surface Area and Pore Volume 
2.1 Production rate 
Figures 8 and 9 show the effect of activator flow rate on surface 
area and pore volume given different production rates. The 
figures show that as the production rate slows, the specific 
surface area and pore volume actually increase. Given a 
relatively slow production rate (10 cm/min) the specific surface 
area and pore volume is significantly higher than under the 
three other production rates. This is because, as the production 
rate slows, the samples take longer to go through carbonization 
and activation, resulting in the fiber interior undergoing a more 
complete denitrification. During the continuous removal of the 
internal nitrogen and other substances, the basic structure of the 
carbon layer increases in thickness, increasing the likely 
formation of micropores, and thus increasing the corresponding 
surface area and pore volume. As the production rate slows, the 
reaction time of water molecules in the fiber interior increases, 
and the water molecules not only react with the edge of the 
carbon crystals or the irregular carbon, but will also react with 
the crystallized carbon, which can easily result in serious 
fraying of the fiber surface. Because this intense reaction will 
cause the original micropores on the fiber surface to enlarge 
and deep inside the fiber. The mesopores and micropores 
specific surface area will increase, and the pore volume will 
both deepen and increase. 
2.2 Activator Flow Rate 
Increasing the activator flow rate from 80 ml/min to 120 
ml/min increases the specific surface area and pore volume, 
with production rate of 120 ml/min producing the best results. 
As the activator flow rate increases, steam fills the 
high-temperature furnace fully attacking the fiber surface. The 
small size of the water molecules allows them to easily 
penetrate to the interior of the fiber to react with the edges of 
the carbon crystalline layer, thus creating pores. Thus, in the 
original carbonization, the pores in the fiber interior are made 
of stacked crystal. At the same time, the number of micropores 
increases, generating many new holes. However, when the 
activator flow rate is increased to 160 ml/min, the untimely 
vaporized water is easily condensed on the material surface, 
and the water molecules produce a simultaneous vaporization 
reaction. The fiber surface is thus subject to a large number of 
attacks, resulting in the creation of many mesopores and 
macropores, leading to increased pore size and decreased 
surface area (see Figs.8 and 9). 
 
3. Pore Size 
3.1. Production Rate 
The specific surface area of the experimental samples was 
analyzed using BJH theoretical analysis to determine the size 
and distribution of the mesopores. Figures 10-12 show the 
distribution of mesopores in carbon fiber and one can see that 
different production rate and activator flow rate produce 
different pore sizes and distributions, with the majority of pore 
sizes falling between 20Å  and 50Å . As the production rate 
slows, the volume of pores in carbon nanofiber adsorbent 
between 20Å  and 50Å  increases. Figures 10 to 12 show that, 
using steam as the activator results in an irregular pore 
distribution and the volume of pores increases as the production 
rate decreases. This is because, as the slower production rate 
increases the reaction time for steam in the fibers’ interior 
structure. 
Figures 10 to 12 show pore volume and distribution 
corresponding to different production rates and different 
activator flow rate. The figures show that, regardless of the 
activator flow rate, when the production rate decreases, the 
pore size and volume increases. This explains that, as the 
high-temperature reaction of the carbon material inside the 
fibers increases in completeness, the water molecules react 
more easily with the carbon crystal layer to obtain a greater 
pore volume and size. 
3.2 Activator Flow Rate 
Figures 13 to 16 show the relationship between activator flow 
rate and pore size and volume. Experimental results show that 
an activator flow rate of 120 ml/min results in larger average 
pore size and volume. This is because controlling the activator

In this sudy, two composite nanofibrous membranes of Polyvinylidenefluoride and 
[poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)] prepared by electrospinning 
process were employed in a direct contact membrane distillation(DCMD) system. We 
changed the parameters of NaCl concentration, flow rate, feed temperature 
difference and fouling to investigate their effects on permeate flux and salt rejection. 
By SEM observations and porosity analyzer technique, it indicated that the 
nanofibrous membrane of the average fiber diameter of 220nm and maximum pore 
diameters distribution of 0.3µm is the best membrane applied in DCMD system. In 
the experiment during 5 hours at the following conditions: hot side inlet temperature 
of 65°C, cold side inlet temperature of 20°C , and both the two side flow rate of 210 
mL/min, it resulted in that the permeate flux of PVDF composite membrane is higer 
5.5 kg/m2hr than PTFE commercial membrane. Consequently, the composite 
nanofibrous membrane obtained in this study can be successfully applied in the 
DCMD system.

In this work, we investigate the development of beta-phase of blended conjugated 
polymers, Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) and Poly[9,9-di-(2-ethylhexyl)-fluorenyl-
2,7-diyl] (PF8/PF2/6), in methylcyclohexane (MCH) trinary solutions, which induced by 
aging at various temperatures. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that the 
gelation mechanism of PF8/PF2/6/MCH solution was driven through the spinodal 
decomposition which vanishes with increasing both temperature and PF2/6 content. 
The gelation temperature, Tgel gel-to-sol transition, Tg-sand spinodal decomposition 
temperature, TSD of PF8/PF2/6/MCH trinary solutions were hindered by PF2/6 
corresponded the dispersedly PF2/6 polymer chain prevented the PF8 chains to 
aggregate forming the beta-phase aggregates (sheetlike aggregates), therefore, the 
microstructure of the beta-phase aggregation in PF8/PF2/6-enriched phase decreases 
from two-dimensional (sheetlike) into one-dimensional (rodlike) with increases PF2/6 
content was found as revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and 
photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. The Tg-s of PF8/PF2/6/MCH gels could be 
disintegrated by moderate heating from 70 to 55 oC with PF2/6 content, which was 
accompanied with the disruptions of the beta-phase means that the looser beta-
phase aggregates was found as the PF2/6 content in PF8/PF2/6 was raised.
