  
properties. The further sulfonation treatment is 
necessary to improve the hydrophilic properties that 
can form well-binded composite structures.  
 
2. Experimental 
The non-woven polypropylene/polyethylene 
membrane sheets were received from Coin Nanotech. 
The membrane was rinsed by de-ionized water and 
then dried in an oven, before its immersion in the 98 
wt-% sulfuric acid solution. The sulfonation reaction 
was carried out at 90°C and atmospheric pressure. 
After the reaction, the sulfonated membrane samples 
were repeatedly rinsed in freshly prepared de-ionized 
water under ultrasonic vibration for several times, 
until the pH value of the water bath reached 6-7. The 
completely rinsed samples were then dried in a 
105°C oven for 5 h, and the sulfonated non-woven 
PP/PE (s-PP/PE) membrane sheets were obtained. 
PVA (M.W. 75,000~80,000, Chang Chung 
Chemicals), acrylic acid monomer (Aldrich) and 
KOH (Merck) were used as received. The 
appropriate weight ratios of acrylic acid monomer 
(varied from 10:3 to 10:7.5 with respect to PVA) and 
1 wt-% cross-linker (triallylamine, Aldrich) were 
directly dissolved and mixed in distilled water with 
agitation for about 12 hours at 60℃. The monomer 
solution was added with 75 mol-% KOH. The 
resulting mixture was then blended with the PVA 
polymer aqueous solution, and the s-PP/PE sheets 
were added. An appropriate weight percent (e.g., 10 
wt-% by AA monomer) of initiator (ammonium 
persulfate, (NH4)2S2O8, Aldrich) was finally added 
into the above highly viscous polymer solution 
mixture for free-radical polymerization. The 
composites of s-PP/PE membrane sheets that were 
coated with the viscous homogeneous polymer 
blends solution were then poured onto a PTFE plate, 
and the excess water solvent was further evaporated 
slowly. Finally, the freestanding composite polymer 
electrolyte membranes were obtained  
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Structural Analysis 
The X-ray diffraction measurements were employed 
to examine the crystalline nature of the 
s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA composite polymer membranes, 
and the diffraction spectra were shown in Fig. 1. It 
was observed that there were five dominated 
crystalline peaks for the s-PP/PE semi-crystalline 
polymer membranes. The first three peaks at 2θ 
angle of 13.8°, 16.7°, 18.2° were from the 
polypropylene crystalline structure, and the other two 
peaks at 21.5° and 24.1° were from polyethylene 
(10,11). In general, the intensity of the crystalline 
peak was reduced as the PVA/PAA polymer blend 
ratio was increased. This implied that the crystalline 
region within the s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA membrane was 
partially destroyed and the amorphous phase was 
greatly enhanced due to the interaction between PVA 
and PAA polymers. It was also shown that the 
polymer had become much more amorphous in 
nature when the PVA/PAA blend ratio was 10:7.5. 
The amorphous characteristic could have enhanced 
the ionic conductivity due to the more flexible local 
chain segmental motion in the polymeric matrix (12). 
SEM micrographs for the s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA 
composite polymer membranes with 3 hour- 
sulfonation treatment of PP/PE non-woven sheet and 
the polymeric blend composition ratio of 
PVA:PAA=10:5 were shown in Fig. 2. It showed a 
dilapidated surface morphology. The cross-sectional 
micrograph also exhibited that PVA/PAA polymer 
blends detached from s-PP/PE fiber morphology. 
When the PP/PE separator sheet sulfonation 
treatment time was increased to 72 hours, the 
hydrophilic property of the PP/PE fiber was greatly 
enhanced. With the same polymeric blend 
composition ratio of PVA:PAA=10:5, the SEM 
micrographs of the improved composite polymer 
membrane were shown in Fig. 3. It has been found 
that there was no phase separation for the PVA/PAA 
polymeric blend and no obvious cavity could be 
found in this structure. The cross-sectional 
micrograph showed excellent bonding structure 
between s-PP/PE fibers and PVA/PAA polymeric 
blends. 
 
3.2 Mechanical Properties  
The stress-strain testing results for the various types 
of s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA composite polymer membranes 
were summarized in Table 1. The results showed that 
  
sealed. The power density of the Zn/MnO2 and 
Al/MnO2 cells are increased when the PVA/PAA 
blend ratio are increased and it were contributed to 
the high ionic conductivity of the s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA 
composite SPEM. For the Al/MnO2 cell, it can 
receive the best power density of 110 mW cm-2 at 
120 mA cm-2discharge current density with the 
PVA/PAA blend ratio of 10:7.5 and is better than that 
of the Zn/MnO2. Because the aluminum material has 
its high theoretical A-h capacity, hight voltage and 
high specific energy. The solid-state alkaline cells 
with s-PP/PEPVA/PAA alkaline composite polymer 
electrolyte membranes exhibit the excellent 
electrochemical property and cell performance.  
 
4.Conclusion 
A group of novel alkaline composite polymeric 
electrolyte membranes, s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA, were 
prepared and characterized. They offered 
advantageous properties in high mechanical strength 
and high ionic conductivity. The optimal design of 
the s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA composite polymeric 
electrolyte membrane comprised of the 72 
hour-sulfonation treatment of the PP/PE sheet and 
suitable blend ratio in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 
polyacrylic acid (PAA). The recommended blend was 
the PVA/PAA composition ratio of 10:5. This 
composite membrane exhibited high ionic 
conductivity of 0.165 S cm-1 at room temperature and 
had good mechanical strength of 12.55 MPa. The 
composite membrane also showed lower crystalline 
region and had a uniform surface morphology. The 
micrographs proved excellent bonding between 
s-PP/PE fiber and PVA/PAA polymeric blends. These 
s-PP/PE/PVA/PAA alkaline composite polymeric 
electrolyte membranes could be further developed for 
potential applications in many battery systems and 
electrochemical devices since it had good mechanical, 
thermal and electrochemical properties.
