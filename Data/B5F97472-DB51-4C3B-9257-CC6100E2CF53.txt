preconcentrate various polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the surfactant-rich phase. 
Various alkanes have been employed to separate 
surfactants from coexisting PAH solutes. With 
introduction of these organic solvents ranging from 
1:2 to 1:0.25 and various alcohols to reduce system 
hydrophobicity, the PAH-containing surfactant rich 
phase tends to phase-separate into two coexisting 
phases: the upper organic phase and the lower 
hydrophilic phase. Among various alkanes used, n-
dodecane worked the best since it produced the 
maximum PAHs recovery in the upper organic phase 
after solvent extraction, while retaining more 
surfactant in the lower hydrophilic phase. By using 
this solvent and several variations of weight ratio, 
ca. 60% of surfactant could be recovered from the 
surfactant-rich phase after a cloud point extraction. 
The optimal condition was 1:1 or 1:0.75 surfactant 
rich phase-solvent weight ratios, which can recover 
60%-63% surfactant from the surfactant-rich phase. 
Addition of n-dodecane in 1:1 weight ratio with 
surfactant-rich phase after L3-phase extraction, 
added with 15 wt-% of n-propanol or iso-propanol can 
recover 56% of Tergitol 15-S-5 contained in the 
surfactant-rich phase.

1. Introduction 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a considerable attention of 
environmental interest because of its carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic characteristic [1]. 
PAHs structure consists of fused aromatic rings and does not contain heteroatom or carry 
substituent [2]. These fused aromatic rings form linear, cluster, or angular arrangements. PAHs are 
found in cooked foods, such as meat cooked at high temperatures and smoked fish [3-4]. PAHs also 
are present in products made from fossil fuels, such as coal-tar pitch, creosote and asphalt. PAHs 
can be naturally released to the environment from forest fire and volcanoes.  
Several extraction techniques have been used to separate PAHs from environmental aquifer 
system. The most common one is using solid-phase extraction (SPE) [5] or liquid-liquid extraction 
(LLE) [6-7]. Those methods take a relatively long analysis time because of their difficulties 
regarding automating the procedures. In order to minimize this disadvantage, other technique has 
been developed. This new technique is based on phase separation by clouding phenomena of 
surfactants which is called cloud point extraction (CPE). It exploits the difference of a nonionic or 
weakly polar surfactant characteristic related with temperature. If a micellar solution of those 
surfactants is heated up, the surfactant will be oil soluble. Increasing the temperature above a 
certain temperature (cloud point), the water solubility of surfactant will almost completely be lost. 
The surfactant will then separate from the aqueous system. The result is that the clear solution 
becomes turbid after phase separation. In most applications CPE is used for many fields of 
extraction, such as for preconcentration of biological molecules [8-9], for analytes as a step prior to 
their determination [10-13], or for the removal of pollutants from aqueous industrial streams and 
waste waters [14-15]. CPE uses water as solvent so that the using of toxic and flammable organic 
solvents can be avoided. CPE can also reach higher recovery efficiency and larger preconcentration 
factor due to the presence of surfactants [16].  
As said before, the homogenous solution of surfactant will separate into two coexisting phases 
above cloud point temperature. The first phase is surfactant-rich phase (L1) which has structure of 
micellar solution of surfactant. The second one is water phase (W) which contains surfactant 
monomers solution at a concentration near its critical micelle concentration (CMC). In view of the 
fact that such a preconcentration and extraction procedure does not involve the clouding phenomena 
of micellar solutions, but the phase change from the L3 phase to the coexisting W + L3 phases, it 
may not be adequate to refer it as the CPE. Instead, the L3-phase extraction process is called [17]. 
Solvent extraction (SE) method has been successfully attempted to recover nonionic surfactant 
from a CPE and L3-phase extraction process, in which the nonionic surfactant Tergitol 15-S-7 or 
Tergitol 15-S-5 used as an extractant to preconcentrate various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) of environmental interest in the surfactant rich phase. In brief, these hydrophobic PAHs, 
tending to be adsorbed on sands and rocks in the aquifer, were mobilized by surfactant solutions 
and subsequently enriched in the surfactant rich phase after CPE [18-29]. The surfactant contained 
in the surfactant-rich phase should be recycled and reused in order to make the process more 
economical and environmental friendly. The HPLCs equipped with UV-Vis and fluororesence 
detectors were used to determine individual concentration of PAHs. The surfactant concentration in 
both phases was measured according to the standard test method ASTM D2959-95.  
In this work, various alkanes have been employed to separate surfactants from coexisting PAH 
solutes. These alkanes include n-octane, n-decane, n-dodecane, n-tetradecane, and n-hexadecane. 
With introduction of these organic solvents with weight ratios of surfactant rich phase to organic 
solvent ranging from 1:2 to 1:0.25 and various alcohols to reduce system hydrophobicity, the PAH-
containing surfactant rich phase tends to phase-separate into two coexisting phases: the upper 
organic phase and the lower hydrophilic phase. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Materials 
Two readily biodegradable nonionic surfactants were used in this work. They are Tergitol 15-
S-5 and Tergitol 15-S-7, both acquired from Union Carbide (Danbury CT). Nonionic surfactants, 
4 
 
was purchased from Katayama Chemical, while iso-butanol was purchased from Alfa Aesar. 
Hydroiodic acid (HI), Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), Potassium Iodide (KI), Sodium thiosulfate 
5-hydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), Starch, Salicylic acid, and Dibutyl phthalate were used for ASTM 
D2959-95 procedure. Hydiodic acid (HI), Starch, and Dibutyl phthalate were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich, while Potassium iodide (KI), Sodium thiosulfate 5-hydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and 
Salicylic acid were purchased from J.T. Baker, and Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) was purchased 
from Alfa Aesar. 
 
2.2. Apparatus 
The PAH concentrations in surfactant-rich phase and water phase were determined using a 
Shimadzu HPLC system consisting of a LC-10AT pump, an ERC-3415α degaser, a Rheodyne 
7725i injector with a 20µL sample loop, a column oven, an SCL-10A system controller, and an 
SPD-10A UV/Vis detector with detection wavelengths set at 220 and 254 nm. PAH concentrations 
were obtained using the Shimadzu Class-VP 5.03 software. The stationary phase was a Supelco C18 
reverse phase column (250mm×4.6 mm, 5µm) connected with an Ascentis C18 guard cartridge 
(7.5mm×4.6 mm, 5µm). A mixture of acetonitrile (80 vol-%) and deionized water (20 vol-%) was 
used as the mobile phase with a flow rate set at 1 mL/min. The limit of detection (LOD) for PAHs 
studied is around 0.1 µg/L. The analysis of both surfactants, Tergitol 15-S-7 and Tergitol 15-S-5, 
was accommodated by ASTM D2959-95 procedure [33]. 
 
2.3. Experimental Procedures 
CPE of PAHs was carried out at 25C. Addition of 0.4 M of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) as an 
additive to the 2 wt-% of Tergitol 15-S-7 is enough to decrease the temperature to 15.6C to 
achieve the phase separation in this process [30]. Initial concentration of each PAH is 5 ppm. 
Appropriate amount of solution (1 L) consisting of nine PAHs, 0.4 M Na2SO4 salt, 2 wt-% Tergitol 
15-S-7, and deionized water was prepared for CPE. Initial concentration of each PAH in L3-phase 
extraction is 5 ppm. Appropriate amount of solution (1 L) consisting of nine PAHs, 2.9 wt-% NaCl 
salt, 1 wt-% Tergitol 15-S-5, and deionized water was prepared for L3-phase extraction. After this 
preparation, the solution was mixed on a magnetic stirrer for six hours and then stored in incubator 
at 25C for 24 hours. The solution after CPE and L3-phase extraction were separated into two 
phases: surfactant-rich phase and water phase. Afterward, 20 µL aliquot from the surfactant-rich 
phase was withdrawn and injected directly into the HPLC instrument without any dilution. In this 
work, triplicate measurements were used to determine the average values. In addition, PAHs 
concentration remained in the water phase after phase separation was not determined because it was 
too small to yield any significant measurement. ASTM D2959-95 procedure was used to analyze 
the nonionic surfactant Tergitol 15-S-7 and Tergitol 15-S-5 content in the surfactant-rich phase. 
The surfactant-rich phase produced from CPE or L3-phase extraction was taken then added 
with solvent. Various alkanes have been employed as solvent to separate surfactants from 
coexisting PAH solutes. In the beginning, the surfactant-rich phase was taken and added with 
solvent. Afterward, the solution was rotated on a rotary mixer set at 20 rpm for 6 hours. After this 
contact, the solution was moved into a separation funnel and stored in incubator for 72 hours. Two 
coexisting phases would be obtained after solvent extraction: upper organic phase and lower 
hydrophilic phase. Finally, these two phases were analyzed with HPLC instrument equipped with 
UV/Vis and Fluororesence detector to obtain the nine PAHs inside them. ASTM D2959-95 
procedure was used to analyze the nonionic surfactant Tergitol 15-S-7 or Tergitol 15-S-5 content in 
these two phases. 
Finally, after knowing the PAHs content and surfactant content of surfactant rich phase, upper 
organic phase, and lower hydrophilic phase, the determination of PAHs recovery and surfactant 
recovery can follow the formulas below (i = upper organic phase or lower hydrophilic phase; SRP = 
surfactant rich phase):

phase/solvent weight ratio 
 
Surfactant recovery described as how much surfactant can be recovered from surfactant-rich 
phase after solvent extraction. In this work, surfactant content in the surfactant-rich phase, upper 
organic phase and lower hydrophilic phase were determined. Supposedly, recycled surfactant can be 
achieved from the lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction because almost no PAHs remain 
in this phase. However, after analysis there is also surfactant extracted to the upper organic phase. It 
means that the surfactant might be distributed in both phases. Surfactant recovery for different 
alkanes used is shown in Figure 3. The lower hydrophilic phase can recover 50%-60% of surfactant 
contained in the surfactant-rich phase. Among various alkanes used, n-dodecane worked the best 
since it produced the maximum PAH recovery in the upper organic phase after solvent extraction, 
while retaining more surfactant in the lower hydrophilic phase.

alkanes with 1:1 surfactant-rich phase/solvent weight ratio 
 
3.2.2. Effect of Surfactant-Rich Phase/Solvent Weight Ratio 
In this variation, n-dodecane was used as model solvent. Figure 4 shows the PAHs recovery of 
upper organic phase for different surfactant-rich phase/solvent weight ratio. From the results, it can 
be seen that PAHs recovery is ranging from 30% to 160%. Acenaphthene (Acp) and anthracene 
(Ant) are the PAH components having irrational values of PAHs recovery, which are much higher 
than 100%. It is because that HPLC instrument doesn’t have good ability to perfectly measure those 
components. To have a good result in measuring Acp and Ant recoveries, we have to sacrifice the 
goodness of HPLC instruments in measuring those of other PAHs. The results show that PAHs 
might exist in this phase especially for 1:0.5 and 1:0.25 weight ratios. It is because of no enough 
solvent to extract PAHs so that the PAHs still remain in the lower hydrophilic phase.

Surfactant recovery described as how much surfactant can be recovered from surfactant-rich 
phase after solvent extraction. Supposedly, recycled surfactant can be achieved from the lower 
hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction because almost no PAHs remain in this phase. However, 
after analysis there is also surfactant extracted to the upper organic phase. It means that the 
surfactant might be distributed in both phases. Surfactant recovery for different alkanes used is 
shown in Figure 7. The lower hydrophilic phase can recover only 31%-37% of surfactant contained 
in the surfactant-rich phase. Nonionic surfactant Tergitol 15-S-5 is more hydrophobic than Tergitol 
15-S-7, so that it becomes more difficult to be recovered. It is indicated by the low value of 
surfactant recovery of the lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction. Surfactant Tergitol 15-
S-5 retains more in the upper organic phase than the lower hydrophilic phase after solvent 
extraction. In order to get higher surfactant recovery, various alcohols have been added to the 
system in order to decrease the hydrophobicity of the system. These alcohols include ethanol, n-
propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, and iso-butanol.

3.3.2. Effect of Alkanes Added with Ethanol 
Ethanol was added to decrease the hydrophobicity of Tergitol 15-S-5 system. Since ethanol is 
soluble in water, there is no limitation about the amount of ethanol added in the solution. In order to 
get more amount of lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction, it is necessary to add ethanol 
as much as 20 wt-% from alkane used. Figure 8 shows the PAHs recovery of upper organic phase 
for different alkanes. From the results, it can be seen that PAHs recovery are about 75% to 145%. 
All of these alkanes successfully extract almost all of the PAHs from the surfactant-rich phase. The

alkane used. Addition of more butanol will produce three immiscible phase after solvent extraction. 
Figure 10 shows the PAHs recovery of upper organic phase for different alkanes. From the results, 
it can be seen that PAHs recovery are about 90% to 145%. All of these alkanes successfully extract 
almost all of the PAHs from the surfactant-rich phase. The same reason can also be used to explain 
the PAHs recovery value which is greater than 100%. It indicates that HPLC instrument does not 
have good ability to measure acenaphthene and anthracene. By using HPLC instrument, almost no 
PAHs are detected in the lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction. 
Surfactant recovery for different alkanes used is shown in Figure 11. The lower hydrophilic 
phase can recover 21%-39% of surfactant contained in the surfactant-rich phase. It can be seen that 
addition of butanol has no affection to surfactant recovery. The addition of 4-wt% of butanol can’t 
increase the amount of lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction. This method can’t be used 
to get higher value of surfactant recovery of lower hydrophilic phase.

Two kinds of propanol isomer (n-propanol and iso-propanol) were added to decrease the

get more amount of lower hydrophilic phase after solvent extraction, it is necessary to add propanol 
as much as 15 wt-% from alkane used. Figure 12 shows the PAHs recovery of upper organic phase

參加 2011年美國化學工程師學會年會報告 
 
一、目的 
報告者參加 2011 年美國化學工程師學會年會的主要目的是在於
發表三篇研究論文，其中的兩篇論文為以口頭報告方式進行，另外一
篇則為壁報方式。從與會聽眾的問題及意見交換中，報告者得到非常
有建設性的意見，有助於未來計畫的順利完成。 
 
二、與會經過 
美國化學工程師學會（American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 
AIChE）為目前國際上最大的化學工程師學會組織，會員除了主要來
自美國以外，還遍布全球各地。AIChE每一年會組織兩次的年會及數
次較小規模的學術性會議。大規模的會議有一次是春季年會，參加者
大都為工業界的化學工程師；另外一個則是秋季年會，規模較大，參
加者除了來自工業界外，大多數為學術界。因此，秋季的年會規模最
大，參加者最多，通常來說，秋季會在 11 月中舉行，不過今年因為
會議地點在較冷的中西部北邊，所以提前到 10月中舉行。以今年 2011
年的秋季年會而言，參加者較去年少但也是多達 4000 多人，會議的
場次也多達 776場。春季會基本是在美南的化工重鎮—德州或路易斯
安納州舉辦；但是秋季會則輪流在各大都市舉行，像是今（2011）年
 3 
但已經是正數。 
同時，在 10月 18日晚上，報告者還有一篇壁報論文報告，主
要是說明如何實驗設計法來求得以觸媒酯化棕櫚酸生產生質柴油的
最適反應條件。有數位來賓對我們的研究感到興趣彼此交換經驗。其
中的一項建議及挑戰便是對含有水的植物油直接轉酯化來生產生質
柴油。這也將是我們下一步的工作。 
在此次的會議中，我們也遇到數位來自台灣各大學的老師及學生。
這些老師包括台大化工系的劉懷勝教授、顏溪成教授、謝之真教授、
錢義隆教授、清華大學的呂世源教授、義守大學的梁明在教授、中原
大學的童國倫教授、中研院原分所陳貴賢教授及中研院物理所的陳彥
龍。同時，在會場也遇到很多台灣的留學生，他們大多數為台大化工
系的畢業生。據說，台大化工系每一年還有 30位左右學生出國進修。
在此方面，成功大學及清華大學化工系是遠遠落在後面。由會議現場
的觀察發現這些學生的論文報告的表現非常好。 
依慣例，年會中的前三天晚上，許多大學都會有招待會（reception），
讓與會者有機會認識主辦的學校，及提供彼此交流的機會。然而，今
年因為金融海嘯的關係，舉辦招待會的學校比較少，只有在星期一及
星期二的晚上才有。今年台大在明尼蘇達大學化工系的胡教授的協助
下舉辦招待會，讓在美國學界許多台籍教授能共聚一堂分享經驗。 
 5 
藉這一個機會和他們敘舊，並討論一些研究課題。例如曾任日
本化工學會秘書長的日本東北大學米本年邦教授預告在明年
的 9月，會來成功大學出席研討會。 
（三）、參加 AIChE年會，報告當下我們的研究成果的同時，也經常
可以由與聽眾問題的互動中，得到一些非常正面的建議，有助
我們於下一階段計畫的執行。 
（四）、藉由參加 AIChE年會，也可以在磨練我們個人以英文報告研 
       究結果的能力 
 
四、建議事項 
（一）、建議國科會可以提高博士班學生出席國際主要會議的補助，
至少能完全負擔註冊費及機票費，和部分生活費。對於這些
年輕的學者，也是台灣未來的棟樑，參加這些會議真的有助
於他們國際觀的建立。綜觀日本、韓國及新加坡，他們在這
一方面的投資是非常的可觀。 
（二）、政府單位，尤其是國科會及經濟部也要把握來參加這些主要
的國際會議，以便知道這些主要國家未來的科研發展。 
（三）、建議政府單位能像韓國政府、新加坡、甚至中國政府支持舉
行招待會，藉此宣傳台灣的科研能力，及高科技產業的發展
情形。
