ABSTRACT 
In this research project, a set of Tersoff potential parameters suitable for BN nanotubes 
was proposed based on the potential parameters for bulk BN materials. The proposed potential 
parameters could be applied to investigations of material and physical properties of BN 
nanotubes. The potential parameters were determined by fitting results from the density 
functional theory calculations of BN nanotubes with the aid of the force-matching method. 
With the proposed potential parameters, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to 
investigate deformation behaviors of (8,8) BN nanotubes under axial tensile strains. Variations 
with the tensile strain in the axial stress, bond lengths, bond angles, radial buckling, and slip 
vectors were all examined. The axial, radial, and tangential components of the slip vector were 
also employed to monitor, respectively, the local elongation, necking, and twisting 
deformation near the tensile failure of the nanotube. From the present research, it was noted 
that the BN nanotube started to fail at the failure strain of 26.7%. The components of the slip 
vector grew rapidly and abruptly after the failure strain, especially for the axial component. 
This implies that the local elongation dominates the failure of the loaded BN nanotube and 
finally results in a chain-like tensile failure mode, as can be observed from the deformation 
morphology of the BN nanotube.

摘要 
本研究計畫以硼氮塊材之Tersoff勢能參數為基礎提出一套適用於奈米硼氮管之Tersoff
勢能參數，以利於執行奈米硼氮管材料與物理特性之研究。本勢能參數是利用力量匹配法
來嵌合奈米硼氮管之密度泛函理論的計算結果所求出來的。以此勢能參數為基礎，本計畫
亦利用分子動力學模擬的方法來探討(8,8)奈米硼氮管於軸向拉伸應變下之變形行為。研究
中檢視了軸向應力、鍵長、鍵角、徑向挫曲及滑移向量等物理量隨拉伸應變之變化情形。
其中亦利用滑移向量之軸向、徑向與切向等分量來探究此奈米硼氮管於接近拉伸破壞時之
局部伸長、頸縮與扭曲等變形行為。由本研究之結果得知，此奈米硼氮管於應變達 26.7%
（即破壞應變）時開始破壞，其滑移向量於應變超過破壞應變後即急遽上升，這對於滑移
向量之軸向分量尤其明顯。其結果表示，局部伸長變形主控了此奈米硼氮管之破壞，並導
致狀似鏈狀之破壞模式。這由此奈米硼氮管之變形形貌圖即可看出。

1. Introduction  
Nanosized tubes have arrested much research interest because of their particular and 
distinguished material properties. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been the well-known nanosized 
tubes and a very promising one dimensional material due to their outstanding characteristics, such 
as high mechanical strength, high Young’s modulus and superior electronic properties [1-4]. 
Recently, non-carbon nanotubes have been also investigated by experimental and theoretical 
methods. Silicon-carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs), boron-nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), gallium-nitride 
nanotubes (GaNTs), zinc-oxide nanotubes (ZnONTs) and aluminum-nitride nanotubes (AlNNTs) 
are some examples [5-9]. Among them, since BN nanotubes have structural analogy to carbon 
nanotubes, they have attracted much attention in recent years. BN nanotubes were predicted 
theoretically in 1994 [10] and were synthesized by Chopra in 1995 [4].
Although BN nanotubes have a hexagonal structure similar to carbon nanotubes, they 
exhibit different electronic, thermal and mechanical properties from carbon nanotubes [4, 6, 
11-14]. For example, the melting point of BN nanotubes (about 900 ℃) [15] is higher than that 
of carbon nanotubes (about 700 ℃) [15]. BN nanotubes also have better resistance to oxidation at 
high temperatures than carbon nanotubes. Besides, BN nanotubes can be used as better thermal 
conductors because they have thermal conductivity of about 300 W/mK. BN nanotubes also act 
as semiconductors of a wide band gap because their electronic properties are independent of their 
diameter and chirality [16]. Because BN nanotubes have such many special properties, they have 
been utilized in broad applications, such as in composite materials, hydrogen storage, and force 
sensors [17-19]. For example, Ma et al. [19] noticed that hydrogen could be chemisorbed on BN 
nanotubes up to 2.6 wt% at room temperature. Tang et al. [20] found that BN nanotubes with 
collapsed structures could increase hydrogen storage efficiency up to 4.2 wt%. Josh observed that 
the BN nanotubes can adsorb some gas molecules, such as O [21], CO [22], NO [22], NH [23], 
and NO [24]. Hence, they can be used in gas sensors.

Because of the potential applications of BN nanotubes, mechanical properties of BN 
nanotubes have also arrested much attention in recent years. In experimental studies, Golberg et 
al. [25], utilized a piezoelectric device to apply uniaxial strains on BN nanotubes and found that 
BN nanotubes have high flexibility when loaded by compressive uniaxial strains. Suravanshi et al. 
[26] also used a method similar to Golberg et al. to determine the elastic modulus of BN 
nanotubes. Regarding numerical studies, Moon and Hwang [27] used the molecular dynamics 
simulations to investigate structural and thermal behaviors of BN nanotubes. They found that the 
zigzag BN nanotubes have a disintegration temperature of 3700-4400 K, which is slightly smaller 
than that of armchair BN nanotubes. Shen [28] also utilized the molecular dynamics simulations 
to examine the thermal-conductivity and tensile-properties of BN, SiC, and Ge nanotubes. They 
found that the tensile failure strain and the Young’s module of BN nanotubes are about 50% and 
0.94 TPa, respectively. 
To explore the potential applications of BN nanotubes, it is worthy to examine the mechanical 
behaviors of BN nanotubes in detail. In this paper, the molecular dynamics simulations were 
utilized to investigate deformation behaviors of (8,8) BN nanotubes under axial tensile strains.

where M is the number of atomic configurations, Nk the number of atoms in configuration k, NC 
the number of additional constraints. Fki(α) and Ar(α) are the force on the i-th atom in 
configuration k and the r-th constraint quantity, respectively.  Both are computed with the 
potential parameters α. and are the corresponding reference quantities calculated from the 0kiF 0rA
ab initio approach. Weighting factor Wr is selected at convenience. 
To determine an appropriate set of the potential parameters for BN nanotubes, four armchair 
BN nanotubes, including (4,4), (6,6), (8,8), and (11,11), were chosen in this research. The BN 
nanotubes were then loaded by various compressive and tensile strains, which ranged from -10% 
to 10%. Data (including atomic configurations, potential energy, and atomic forces) calculated 
from the density functional theory were selected as the reference data for the force-matching 
method. At the beginning, the Tersoff potential parameters for interactions between the boron and 
nitrogen atoms of bulk BN materials proposed by Albe and Möller [31] were used as the initial 
set of the potential parameters. The potential parameters for homo-element atom interactions (i.e., 
the interactions between the boron and boron atoms as well as between the nitrogen and nitrogen 
atoms) were neglected in the present study. Minimization procedures were then applied to the 
objective function (Eq (1)) to modify the potential parameters. With the minimization procedures 
an optimal set of the potential parameters can be determined. 
Table 1 lists the potential parameters determined from the present fitting for the BN 
nanotubes and from those proposed by Albe and Möller for bulk BN materials. As can be seen, 
the present potential parameters are slightly different from those for bulk BN materials. Potential 
energy of the BN nanotubes (4,4), (6,6), (8,8), and (11,11) calculated from the density functional 
theory (DFT), the present potential parameters (Present fitting), and the potential parameters for 
bulk BN materials (Bulk) are displayed in Figure 2. From the figure, good agreements between 
the present results and those from the DFT can be seen. The potential parameters for bulk BN 
materials, however, offer much higher potential energy for all the cases studied. 
2.2 Simulation details 
With the obtained potential parameters, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 
(8,8) BN nanotubes to investigate deformation behaviors of the BN nanotubes under axial tensile 
strains. Figure 3 shows the simulation model of the BN nanotube, which comprises 320 boron 
atoms (in gray) and 320 nitrogen atoms (in blue). An NVT ensemble was used in the molecular 
dynamics simulations and the system temperature was set at 300 K with the use of the Nosé 
Hoover thermostat algorithm [32]. During the simulations, atoms located in both end regions with 
3  
maximal value of 1.16 TPa. After this point the stress drops abruptly to a value approximating to 
zero. The corresponding strain (the failure strain) is 26.7%. The BN nanotube began to fail at this 
strain. It was also noticed that the radial buckling decreases gradually from 0.032 (at the 
beginning) to 0.015 (before failure). Tensile loads reduce the radial buckling of the BN nanotube 
and smooth slightly the rugged surface of the nanotube. 
 Variations in the bond lengths and bond angles with the axial tensile strains are plotted in 
Figure 5. The bond lengths (I and II) and bond angles (A to D) are defined in Figure 3(b). It was 
noticed that bond length II increases obviously with the extension of the axial strains, while the 
variation of the bond length I is not evident (from 1.46 Å to 1.5 Å). The bond angles B and C 
have nearly identical values during the whole loading history. The bond angle A also has nearly 
the same variations as the bond angle D. With the increase in the axial strains and the bond length 
II, the bond angles B and C enlarge rapidly from 120° (before loading) to 145° (before failure) 
but the bond angles A and D decrease with a slower rate from their initial values (120°) to 
107°(before failure). 
 To observe the deformation of the BN nanotube in detail, especially near the failure of the 
nanotube, the slip vector concept was also employed in this research. The slip vector ( ), like 
Burger’s vector, is usually used to evaluate the dislocation behavior of crystalline structures and 
can be expressed as [35] 
αs

where sn   the number of slipped neighbors nearest to atom α.  Vectors  and  are the 
current (deformed) and reference (initial) position vectors, respectively, from atom α to the 
slipped neighbor atom β.  Variations of the slip vector can not only be used to examine the 
detailed local deformation of materials, but can also be applied to observe the collective motion 
of a group of atoms if these atoms have the same magnitude of the slip vectors.

 Figure 6 shows variations in the axial stress and slip vectors of the (8,8) BN nanotube near 
the failure strain S1 (26.7%). For ease of discussion, three (including the axial, radial, and 
tangential) components of the slip vector were displayed. The axial component (the axial slip 
vector) can evaluate the local (relative) elongation of the loaded nanotube. The radial component 
(the radial slip vector) can examine the extent of the local necking during the deformation of the 
nanotube. On the other hand, the tangential component (the tangential slip vector) can monitor 
the local twisting deformation of the nanotube. In addition, four stations S1 to S4 after the failure 
strain were selected to explore the detailed failure deformation of the loaded nanotube. 
 As can be seen from Figure 6, the axial slip vector starts to grow steeply at the failure strain 
S1. This indicates that there initiates local elongation at the failure strain and the loaded nanotube 
begins to release stress when the local elongation initiates. This leads to the abrupt drop of the 
axial stress after the failure strain, as can be observed from the figure. With the increase of the 
5  
7  
vectors have been examined for the deformation behaviors. Specifically the axial, radial, and 
tangential components of the slip vector were employed to monitor, respectively, the local 
elongation, necking, and twisting deformation near the tensile failure of the BN nanotube. 
 It was noticed from the present simulations that the BN nanotube started to failure at the 
failure strain of 26.7%. The three components of the slip vector grew quickly and abruptly after 
the failure strain, especially for the axial slip vector. This indicates that the local elongation 
dominates the failure of the tensile-loaded BN nanotube and finally results in a chain-like failure 
mode.

FIG. 1. A coarse-grained linked-vector model for a
BCH5H molecule.
The configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC)
simulation was then applied on the linked-vector model to
obtain the equilibrium structure of the molecular system.
In the simulation, all the linked vectors of the system
were moved vector by vector via the CBMC algorithm [3]
until conformation corresponding to an energetically
favorable state (i.e., the equilibrium structure) had been
obtained. In this study, a total number of 2×106 CBMC
steps were applied, which were demonstrated to be
sufficient for the equilibrium structure of the system at
the studied temperature 50 K. Position data from the last
1000 steps were averaged to attain the equilibrium
structure.
RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION
A 3×3 matrix G [4] relating to the mean-square
radius of gyration of the molecular system was employed
to examine the nanostructure of the system. It is noted
that the structure of a molecular system can be observed
from the eigenvalues g1, g2, and g3 of the matrix, where g1,
g2, and g3 designate the maximum, medium, and
minimum eigenvalues of the matrix, respectively. If the
ratios of g2/g1 and g3/g1 (or (g2+g3)/2g1) approach unity,
the system has a ball-like shape. However, if the ratios
are much less than unity, it tends to a pipe-like shape.
Fig. 2 shows the ratios of g2/g1, g3/g1, and (g2+g3)/2g1
for the system with various numbers of chains m. As can
be seen from the figure, the ratios are much less than unit
for the system with m = 3 and 6. It implies that the
equilibrium structure of the smaller system exhibits a
pipe-like shape (as shown in Figs. 3a and 3b). It was also
noticed that the ratios rise rapidly and approach unity as
the system size m increases, which indicates that the
equilibrium structure of the larger system tends to a
ball-like shape. Figs. 3c and 3d show the ball-like
equilibrium structures for m = 15 and 100, respectively.
The transition from a pipe-like structure to a ball-like
structure is caused by the increasing intermolecular
attraction force when the number of chains grows. This
can be seen from Fig. 4, which plots the nonbonded
interaction energy (the attraction energy) for the systems.
