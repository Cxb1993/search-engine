ABSTRACT 
Synthesis, curing behavior, and properties for unsaturated polyester (UP)-montmorillonite 
(MMT) nanocomposites were investigated.  Our objective was to understand the effects of 
chemical composition, structure, molecular polarity, molecular weight, and radius of gyration of UP 
resins on the cured sample morphology, dynamic change of the interlayer spacing of MMT, curing 
kinetics, volume shrinkage characteristics, internal pigmentability, fracture toughness, and glass 
transition temperatures in the major continuous styrene-crosslinked polyester phase for the 
ST/UP/MMT ternary systems.

INTRODUCTION 
Adding specific thermoplastic polymers as low profile additives (LPA) in the unsaturated 
polyester resins (UP) can lead to a reduction or even elimination of the polymerization shrinkage 
during the cure1.  By employing non-reactive LPA2, microvoids3 can be generated during the cure, 
which can then compensate for the volume shrinkage.  In contrast, by employing reactive LPA4, 
the intrinsic polymerization shrinkage may be reduced, which is due to the reduction in cyclization 
reaction of UP resin during the cure caused by the favorable intermolecular crosslinking reaction 
between UP and reactive LPA,  In recent years, nanocomposites based on montmorillonite (MMT) 
and UP have been investigated quite extensively5-9.  However, the volume shrinkage for the 
UP-MMT nanocomposites has seldom been treated9. 
The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of chemical structure of UP resin, and 
the amount of silane-treated MMT added on the volume shrinkage characteristics for UP-MMT 
nanocomposites.  An integrated approach of static phase characteristics of styrene (St)/UP/MMT

CH2=C(CH3)COO-(CH2)3-Si-(OCH3)3.  The organophilic part of the silane-treated MMT can then 
be represented by CH2=C(CH3)COO-(CH2)3-, which is relatively nonpolar in comparison with the 
UP resin. For the first series of the two UP resins used, namely, MND65 and MND25 types, the 
molecular polarity of the former UP is higher than that of the latter one10, where the calculated 
dipole moment per unit volume, μ/V1/2,by group contribution methods is 0.0825 and 0.0784 
debye/cm3/2, respectively (Table 1).  For second series of the three UP resins used, namely, 
MA-PG, MA-PA-PG and MA-IPA-PG types, the molecular polarity of the former UP is higher than 
those of the latter twos, where the calculated dipole moment per unit volume, μ/V1/2,by group 
contribution methods is 0.0864, 0.0814 and 0.0808 debye/cm3/2, respectively (Table 1). (The 
corresponding value for the organophilic part of the silane-treated MMT, which is relatively 
non-polar as compared with UP, can be calculated as 0.0590 debye/cm3/2).  In general, the higher 
the polarity difference per unit volume between UP and silane-treated MMT, the less compatibility 
for the ST/UP/silane-treated MMT system at 25oC and 110oC prior to reaction.  Hence, at a fixed 
MMT content and in the case of employing the first series of UP as the resin matrix, the 
ST/UP/silane-treated MMT system containing the MND25 type of UP would be theoretically more 
compatible than that containing the MND65 type of UP.  Similarly, in the case of employing the 
second series of UP as the resin matrix, the ST/UP/silane-treated MMT system containing the 
MA-PA-PG or the MA-IPA-PG type of UP would be theoretically more compatible than that 
containing the MA-PG type of UP. Also, for all of ST/UP/silane-treated MMT systems, adding a 
higher content of silane-treated MMT would lead to a less compatibility of the ST/UP/silane-treated 
ternary system.  This is in agreement with the static phase characteristics data for the uncured 
ST/UP/silane-treated systems at 25oC and at 110oC in the case of employing the second series of 
UP as the resin matrix (Table 2, where the degree of phase separation, as revealed by the relative 
weight of lower layer solution, was less for the MA-PA-PG systems than the MA-PG systems.  
Also, for either the MA-PA-PG or the MA-PG systems, the degree of phase separation was higher 
with a higher content of MMT added. 
Data in Table 2 reveal that at a fixed content of MMT, the phase separation rate was faster for 
the MA-PG system than the MA-PA-PG system.  Also, higher MMT content could also lead to a 
faster phase separation rate.  According to our previous work15 for the St/UP(MA-PA-PG)/10% 
silane-treated MMT systems, after the phase equilibrium, the styrene concentration in the lower 
layer, which would be MMT-rich, was higher than that in the upper layer.  This reveals that the 
diffusion of styrene monomer, which is a small molecule when compared with the UP prepolymer, 
into the gallery of the silane-treated MMT would be easier than that of UP prepolymer, leading to 
an MR higher than 2/1 in the lower layer. 
 
Cured Sample Morphology, and XRD Measurements for MMT Clay and St/UP/MMT 
Nanocomposites 
During the cure at 110oC for St/UP/silane-treated MMT systems, SEM micrographs (not shown) 
show that adding a higher content of MMT would result in a more noticeable two-phase cured 
sample morphology, which consisted of a flake-like continuous phase and an MMT-rich dispersed 
phase.  At a fixed content of MMT and in the case of employing the first series of UP as resin 
matrix, the MND65 system was less compatible than the MND25 system, as evidenced by the 
smaller average size of MMT-dispersed phase for the latter system in the SEM micrographs (Fig. 1).  
In the case of employing the second series of UP as resin matrix, the MA-PG system was more 
compatible than the MA-PA-PG or the MA-IPA-PG system, where the formation of local phase 
domains with an exfoliated nanocomposite structure during cure is more favorable for the MA-PG 
system. 
After the silane treatment for the neat MMT, the interlayer spacing of the MMT was found to be 
increased from 1.00 nm to 1.08 nm, as expected, where the scattering angle, 2θ, was decreased from 
8.8o to 8.2o as measured by XRD.  For all of the St/UP/silane-treated MMT nanocomposites, 
diffraction peaks could still be detected down to a 2θ of 3.2o to 6.6o as observed from the XRD 
 6
polarity and a higher C=C unsaturation in its backbone than the MND65 type of UP (Table 1), may 
generally lead to a lower volume shrinkage after the cure (Table 4).  In contrast, at a fixed 
silane-treated MMT content and in the case of using the second series of UP as resin matrix, 
employing the MA-PG type of UP, with a smaller prepolymer size (Rg = 1.49 nm), a higher 
molecular polarity and a higher C=C unsaturation in its backbone than the MA-PA-PG and the 
MA-IPA-PG types of UP (Table 1), may generally lead to a lower volume shrinkage after the cure 
(Table 4).  The lowest volume shrinkage achieved was -4.2% (at a level of 2.5%MMT) and -3.1% 
(at a level of 5%MMT), for the first series of MND and the second series of MA-PG systems, 
respectively. 
It is inferred that the formation of local phase domains with an exfoliated nanocomposite 
structure during cure is more favorable for the more compatible and the more reactive MND25 
system when compared with the MND65 system.  In contrast, it is more favorable for the less 
compatible and the more reactive MA-PG system when compared with the MA-PA-PG and 
MA-IPA-PG systems. 
 
   
CONCLUSIONS 
UP-MMT nanocomposites have been prepared by in-situ intercalative polymerization of 
St/UP/silane-treated MMT ternary systems at 110oC.  For the St/UP/silane-treated MMT system, 
X-ray diffraction and TEM results have supported the formation of a nanocomposites, characterized 
by a random dispersion of intercalated/exfoliated aggregates of clay sheets in the polymer matrix.  
For St/UP/silane-treated MMT systems, increasing the content of MMT may generally result in a 
decrease, followed by an increase in the volume shrinkage after the cure.  The former is due to the 
intermolecular reaction between UP and the silane-treated MMT during the cure, causing a 
decrease of intrinsic polymerization shrinkage.  The latter is due to the agglomeration of MMT, 
leading to a decrease in the interfacial area between the UP and MMT, and, in turn, the more 
compact microgel structures caused by the intramolecular reaction of UP.    At a fixed 
silane-treated MMT content and in the case of using the first series of UP as resin matrix, 
employing the MND25 type of UP, with a larger prepolymer size, a lower molecular polarity and a 
higher C=C unsaturation in its backbone than the MND65 type of UP, may generally lead to a 
lower volume shrinkage after the cure.  In contrast, at a fixed silane-treated MMT content and in 
the case of using the second series of UP as resin matrix, employing the MA-PG type of UP, with a 
smaller prepolymer size, a higher molecular polarity and a higher C=C unsaturation in its backbone 
than the MA-PA-PG and the MA-IPA-PG types of UP, may generally lead to a lower volume 
shrinkage after the cure.

The compatibility of ST/UP/CSR systems at 25oC and 
110oC prior to reaction [12], cure kinetics of the ternary 
systems by DSC [13], cured sample morphology for the 
fractured surface by SEM [14], and cured sample 
morphology by optical microscopy (OM) [14] have been 
investigated.  The relative quantity of microcracking in the 
morphology sample under OM was also measured by 
means of an image analyzer [14].  Volume shrinkage and 
color depth [4] of the cured sample were measured by 
density methods [14] and by using a chromameter (Minolta, 
CR-300) respectively. 
 
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
  The molecular polarity of UP resin and the shell of 
CSR was evaluated in terms of the calculated dipole 
moment per unit volume [12], µ/V1/2 (Table 2).  It was 
higher for the MA-PG type of UP than the MA-PA-PG 
(0.0867 vs. 0.0811).  Also, the molecular polarity of UP 
resin was higher than that of the shell of CSR. 
In general, the higher the polarity difference per unit 
volume between UP and the shell of CSR, the less 
compatibility for the ST/UP/CSR system at 25oC prior to 
reaction.  Data in Table 2 reveal that at a fixed CSR,  the 
ST/UP/CSR system containing MA-PG type of UP resin  
would lead to a lower compatibility than that of the 
ST/UP/CSR system containing MA-PA-PG type of UP 
resin  This is generally in agreement with the static phase 
characteristics data for the uncured ST/UP/CSR systems at 
25oC (Table 3), where the MA-PG system containing either 
E0 or E0-EA(2) would phase separate and the MA-PA-PG 
system would not. 
At a fixed CSR the phase separation time for the 
uncured ST/UP/CSR systems at 25oC and  110oC was 
generally shorter for the MA-PG system than the MA-PA-
PG system.  For both the MA-PG and the MA-PA-PG 
systems, increasing the mixing temperature from 25oC to 
110oC could shorten the phase separation time.  However, 
the degree of phase separation, as revealed by the weight 
percent of upper layer solution (i.e. wu). was reduced for the 
MA-PG systems containing E0 or E0-EA(2).  This is in 
contrast to the MA-PG system containing E1 and the MA-
PA-PG systems containing E1 or E0-EA(2). 
During the cure at 110oC, SEM micrographs at 5000 X 
showed that both the neat MA-PA-PG and the neat MA-PG 
systems containing no CSR exhibited a flake-like 
microstructure (not shown).  For the MA-PA-PG systems, 
adding a CSR at either 5 wt. % or 10 wt. % level can cause 
a less compatible ST/UP/CSR system with a two-phase 
microstructure, which consisted of a flake-like continuous 
phase and a CSR-dispersed phase (not shown).  Also, at a 
fixed CSR content, the E1 system was the least 
incompatible, as evidenced by the smallest average area for 
the dispersed phase, followed by the E0 system  and the E0-
EA(2) system, which showed the same trend as that of 
predicted compatibility for the uncured ST/UP/CSR 
systems (Table 2).  Moreover, for a fixed type of CSR, 
adding a higher content of CSR may lead to the more 
incompatibility of the ST/UP/CSR system, again as 
evidenced by the larger average area for the CSR-dispersed 
phase. 
During the cure at 110oC, SEM micrographs at 5000 X 
(not shown) show that for the ST/UP/5%E1 and the 
ST/UP/10%E1systems, the MA-PA-PG systems were more 
compatible than the MA-PG systems, where the latter 
system possessed a larger average area for the dispersed 
phase with globule morphology inside.  
During the cure at 110oC, OM micrographs at 500 X 
(not shown) show that for the ST/UP/E0 and the ST/UP/E0-
EA(2) systems, the MA-PA-PG systems were again more 
compatible than the MA-PG systems, where the latter 
system possessed a larger number of the dispersed phase.   
 For the cured CSR-containing UP resin systems with 
their characteristic morphologies, their mechanical behavior 
can be approximately represented by the Takayanagi 
models [15], where arrays of weak CSR (R) and stiff 
styrene-crosslinked polyester (P) phases are employed (not 
shown).  For all of the six ST/UP/CSR systems, the two-
phase microstructure can be represented by a P-(P-P-S) 
model (not shown). 
The volume shrinkages of the neat UP resins were 
about 9.0% (MA-PA-PG type) and 10.8% (MA-PG type).  
For ST/UP/CSR systems, adding a higher content of CSR 
may generally result in a lower volume shrinkage, or even 
an expansion (for MA-PG systems containing 10% E0 or 
5% E0-EA(2)) after the cure.  At a fixed CSR content, 
employing the MA-PG type of UP, which is more reactive, 
more flexible, and with a higher molecular polarity than the 
MA-PA-PG type of UP, could result in the more 
incompatibility of the ST/UP/CSR system during the cure, 
and may lead to a lower volume shrinkage.  Apparently, 
pertinent incompatibility of the ST/UP/CSR system during 
the cure is indispensable for good volume shrinkage control.  
For the MA-PA-PG systems, adding 10% E0-EA(2) as an 
LPA would lead to the best volume shrinkage control 
(∆V/V0 ≅ -5.7%).  In contrast, for the MA-PG systems, 
adding 5% E0 or 10% E0-EA(2) as an LPA would lead to 
the most effective volume shrinkage control (∆V/V0 ≅ -
1.5% to -1.7%). 
The effects of shell chemical structure of CSR on L* 
value as the index of internal pigmentability for 
ST/UP/CSR systems after the cure generally shows reverse 
trend to those on the fractional volume shrinkage.  (The 
higher the L* value, the worse the internal pigmentability.)  
Since an L* value within about 30 can be employed as the 
acceptable upper bound for good internal pigmentability in 
this study, all of the MA-PA-PG systems and ST/UP(MA-
PG)/10% E0-EA(2) system exhibit good internal 
pigmentability (Table 5).  Among the six ST/UP/CSR 
systems, the ST/UP(MA-PG)/10% E0-EA(2) system has 
provided the best volume shrinkage control (∆V/V0 ≅ -
1.7%), and achieved acceptable internal pigmentability (L* 
≅ 29-30).
