ABSTRACT
Using the Timoshenko beam theory and applying
Hamilton’s principle, the present study establishes
bending vibrations of a spinning pretwisted beam
subjected to a harmonically time-dependent compressive
axial force. Equations of motion of the twisted beam are
derived in the spinning twist coordinate frame. The finite
element method is employed to discretize the equations
of motion into time-dependent ordinary differential
equations with gyroscopic terms. A set of second-order
ordinary differential equations with periodic coefficients
of Mathieu-Hill type is formed to investigate the effect of
twist angle, spinning speed, static component of axial
force, length-to-width ratio and restraint condition on the
parametric instability of the beam. It is believed that the
present model is valuable for the parametric studies to
understand better the various dynamic aspects of the
twisted beam affecting its dynamic stability behavior.
Keywords: pretwist, Timoshenko beam, gyroscopic,
parametric instability
1. INTRODUCTION
Vibration and stability analyses of the pre-twisted
structures, such as turbine blades, propeller blades and
drill bits, have received many researchers’attention in
different engineering fields for past decades. In general,
the dynamic behaviors of the pre-twisted structures have
been analyzed based on Euler beam theory or
Timoshenko beam theory. In addition to the geometric
aspects, the effects of the rotational speed and axial load
on the vibration and stability of twisted beams have also
been studied by several scientists and engineers. A
general review of the dynamic aspects of pre-twisted
beams can be found in review paper by Leissa [1] and
Rosen [2].
Based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the effect of
the twist angle on the natural frequencies and mode
shapes of the cantilever turbine blade has been studied by
Carnegie [3], Dawson and Carnegie [4], and Sabuncu [5].
By treating the blade as a pre-twisted Timoshenko beam,
the vibration equations of motion of the pre-twisted blade
were developed using different techniques by Carnegie
[6], Dawson et al. [7], Gupta and Rao [8], Abbas [9],
Subrahmanyam et al. [10], Lin et al. [11], Banerjee [12],
and Yardimoglu and Yildirim [13] to study the effects of
geometric aspects, rotary inertia and shear deformation
on the lateral frequencies of the blade. Above studies
were concentrated mainly on the free vibration
characteristics of nonrotating pre-twisted beam
structures.
The dynamic behaviors of rotating beams about a
longitudinal or transverse axis have been investigated
extensively related to the vibration of shafts, turbine
blades and drill bits. A rotating twisted Timoshenko beam
which rotates about an axis normal to the longitudinal
axis of the beam was investigated by Fu [14], Rao and
Carnegie [15], Subrahmanyam and Kaza [16], Rao and
Gupta [17], and Sabuncu and Evran [18]. The lateral
vibration equations of motion of the axially spinning
pre-twisted beam have been established by Tekinalp and
Ulsoy [19,20], and Lee [21-23] to study the effects of the
spinning speed, the pre-twisted angle and aspect ratio of
the beam on the natural frequencies and dynamic stability
using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The influences of
the spinning speed of a twisted Timoshenko beam
spinning about its longitudinal axis on the bending
frequencies and buckling loads were studied by Liao and
Dang [24], Chen and Keer [25] and Chen [26]. The
effects of twist angles and rotational speed on the
vibrational characteristics were investigated by the finite
element method.
The effect of the axial loading on the vibration
frequencies and stability of pre-twisted beams has been
treated by many scientists and engineers. Based on the
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the lateral vibration of a
spinning twisted beam under a constant axial load was
developed by Tekinalp and Ulsoy [19,20] to investigate
its influence on the natural frequencies of the drill bit.
The bending-bending vibration of a spinning twisted
Timoshenko beam subjected to a time-independent axial
load was also established by Liao and Dang [24], and
Chen and Keer [25] in the spinning twist frame to study
the effects of the axial force on the natural frequencies.
By directly employing the flexural vibration equations of
motion derived by Chen and Keer [25], Chen and Ho [27]
used the differential transform method to analyze the
natural frequencies and mode shapes of a spinning

and by changing the symbol “I” to “J”, Eq. (6) can also 
be applied to mass moments of inertia. By utilizing the
transformations (5)-(6) into Eqs. (1)- (4), the system
equations for a spinning pretwisted Timoshenko beam in
the rotating twist frame throughout the domain and the
associated boundary conditions could be obtained. The
governing equations of motion and boundary conditions
could be expressed in matrix form as follows.

Here M , C and (t)K i are coefficient matrices
relating to the system characteristics of the spinning
twisted beam structure; d = [u, u, , ]T is the
displacement matrix of the twisted beam in the rotating
twisted frame; u, u,  and  are transverse
displacements and angles of rotation.
3. DYNAMIC STABILITY ANALYSIS
To investigate the dynamic stability of a spinning
twisted Timoshenko beam subjected to an axial pulsating
force, a finite element method is utilized to write the
governing equations in a discrete form of ordinary
differential equations with time as the independent
variable. The Mindlin-type linear beam element [34] with
eight degrees of freedom is used here. Each node of the
beam element has four degrees of freedom, two total
transverse displacements and two rotations due to
bending. Hence, the displacement function of the beam
element can be approximated by

Here shape functions N1 = 1 –z/Le and N2 = 1 –z/Le,
where Le is the length of the twisted beam element; u,

of the twisted beam element at its nodal points.
By using Eq. (9) into the weak form of the equations
of motion, (7) and (8), and applying Galerkin‘s criterion, 
the resulting element equations are obtained as follows

F F (t)FK  are the element stiffness matrices due
to spinning speed, the bending and shear effects, and
axial pulsating force, respectively. The skew-symmetric
property of the element Coriolis leads to the typical
coupling phenomenon of the behavior of the spinning
shaft system in the lateral plane. Special treatment must
be taken when deriving the element stiffness of a
Timoshenko beam because the numerical integration can
cause the shear locking when using elements of C0-order.
The selective reduced integration method proposed by
Hughes [35] is used here. The stiffness matrix due to
bending effect is computed using the normal quadrature
rule, while the stiffness matrix due to shear effect is
integrated with one-point quadrature scheme to avoid the
shear locking. Directly assembling these element
matrices and imposing the essential boundary conditions
obtain as the general form of the global system of
equations
0pKKKpCpM   )( FB (11a)
or
0p(t)F-KKpCpM z   )F( B (11b)
where the matrices M, C, K, KB and KF are the
corresponding global matrices. Eq. (11) is the standard
form of a gyroscopic type system of equations of motion.
The periodic compressive axial force is assumed to be
of the form
)cos(cos tPtFFF crpoz   (12)
where Fo is the static axial load; Fp and  are the
amplitude of the perturbed axial force and the disturbing
frequency; Pcr is the critical static buckling load of the
non-spinning untwisted beam; andare the respective
static and dynamic load factors. Introducing Eq. (12) into
Eq. (11) yields
0pF-F-KKpCpM   )tcosPP( crcrB  (13)
which represents a second-order ordinary differential
equation with periodic coefficients of Mathieu-Hill type.
Based on the method presented in Bolotin [32], the
boundaries between stable and unstable solutions of Eq.
(13) are separated by periodic solutions of periods T and
2T, where T = 2/. The instability zones bounded by
solutions with period 2T are of greater practical
importance. As the first-order approximation, the
periodic solutions of p with period 2T can be sought in
the one-term Fourier series as

homogenous linear algebraic equations in terms of a and
b can be obtained in matrix form as follows.

Eq. (15) can be rewritten in the form of quadratic
eigenvalue problem (QEP)
5(1) The first instability region becomes smaller, but the
next three instability regions change differently as the
pretwist angle is increased.
(2) The width of the first instability region becomes
wider, but that of the second instability region becomes
narrower when the spinning speed increases. The onset
of first instability region occurs at a lower disturbance
frequency, but that of second instability region occurs at
a higher disturbance frequency with the increasing speed.
(3) The instability regions are to be shifted to lower
frequencies with wide instability regions when the static
load component is increased, which shows a
destabilizing effect on the dynamic stability behavior of
the twisted beam.
(4) The onset of dynamic instability occurs much later
when the length-to-width ratio is decreased. The width of
the first instability region is decreased, but that of the
second is increased with the decreasing length-to-width
ratio.
(5) The instability regions have been influenced due to
constraints provided at the ends
