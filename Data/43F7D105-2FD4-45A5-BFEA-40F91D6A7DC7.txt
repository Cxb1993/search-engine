Through distribution management of the learning
platform, enterprises apply e-learning systems to
dispatch learning objects to employees. These learning
objects consist of 1) content: documents, learning
materials, messages; 2) source: employee knowledge,
information from internet, previous data file; and 3)
format: image, audio/video, text. Most enterprises
recognize the importance of improving productivity by
integrating the learning platform with knowledge
management systems. The result of integration will
exploit the community knowledge power to reach
innovation for enterprises.
2.2. Dynamically configured learning
Unless it raises the motivation of learning, the e-
learning system does not provide effective solution for
learning just depended on IT support. Three issues
should be considered in an e-learning system including
knowledge management, technology support, and
software integration. Through internet, e-learning
systems distribute learning objects as well as
externalize accumulated enterprise knowledge to assist
employees in their routine tasks [2] [3] [4]. A flexible
e-learning system should allow learners to choose their
own learning materials based on their learning pattern
and specific environment. Regardless of the location,
the system dynamically configures learning materials
and dispatches to learners through interactive user
interface. Learners receive proper materials and
resources from the system to reflect their requirements.
In addition, tutors can use the system to dynamically
trace and evaluate the learning management and
learning efficiency of an individual learner [5] [6] [7].
Most e-learning systems created by experts without
participation of learners who passively download pre-
set materials to retrieve and browse resources. This
situation is now changed due to the concept of Web 2.0.
By using the tool such as Blog, e-learning systems
become a platform of knowledge sharing. Dynamic
configuration of learning materials is more encouraged
to be embedded into the e-learning system.
2.3. Personalized learning based on roles
Due to the business globalization, a collaborative
working environment is gradually applied for
enterprises. Employees are playing different roles in
various projects to work with partners from their
business alliance. Employees normally search for
support from documents or colleagues in specific
projects. Through participation of employees to create
learning cases can contribute further process of
knowledge acquisition [8]. Based on roles assigned to
employees and their job attributes, the e-learning
system should provide appropriate personalized
learning materials. Difference in e-learning approach
for worker roles in a manufacturing environment is
discussed in [9] where the learning system provides
technical training, management experience and
decision making training to operator, middle-level
manager and high-level manager respectively. This
role-based e-learning system aims of matching practical
operation with training requirement.
3. A dynamic e-learning system for the
collaborative environment
This research discusses on-job training required in a
collaborative environment for an enterprise. A structure
of dynamic e-learning system is proposed based on
learning requirement analysis for different work roles.
Various employees learning patterns are classified as
the base of predicting proper learning materials and
dynamically configuring these materials with advice
from tutors. Whenever employees and members of the
business alliance have training requirement to solve
problems they have in project execution, a flexible e-
learning system should timely provide respondent
solution. In this paper, project requirement including
knowledge, skill, management and service are used as
the input for role retrieval and identification. Five
modules are created in this structure as shown in figure
1. In the beginning, employee’s role is retrieved and
identified based on the job level and access rights.
Through the learning objective described in the
learner’s profile, the system predicts learning
requirement to satisfy the employee’s project
requirement.
The system follows this prediction and dynamically
configures learning objects and automatically generates
learning courses. During the process of generation,
advice of tutors is also considered. The input, output,
function, and link of each module performed in the
system are described in detail in the following
subsections.
3.1. Role retrieval and identification module
In the role retrieval and identification module,
employee’s role is identified based on the work level
and access rights owned by the user who logs in the
system. The system manager, contents producer, tutors
and learners are classified as legitimate users. Learners
can be different level employees such as staffs,
technicians, managers and partners from the business

3.5. Learning advice module
In this module, suggestion for the learning courses is
displayed at the window of the learner’s side followed
by learning materials configuration. Learners can
accept this suggestion and execute the learning
program. In the proposed system, alternative learning
routes are allowed for learners to plan their own
learning requirement if the learning advice is rejected
by learners. In this case, this personalized learning
route is updated to the system for future reference. The
purpose of predicting learning requirement in the
proposed system structure is to provide optimal
learning route under collaborative project environment.
Input: Dynamically configured courses
Output: learning courses items
Function: generate learning advice
Link: User interface, learning requirement prediction
There are two ways of retrieve learning materials for
learners as shown in figure 3. Through the user
interface in which obsolete information is filtered by
the system, learners either accept learning materials
listed in system suggestion or select specific learning
route with access permission.
