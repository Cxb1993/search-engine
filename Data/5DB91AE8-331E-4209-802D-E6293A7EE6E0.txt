Abstract 
 
Neural engineering is an interdisciplinary 
research field. It utilizes many engineering theories 
and tries to bridge the gap between the operations 
of the neurons and the higher brain functions. For 
instance, we can use proper sound stimuli, collect 
the EEG data and then analyze the relationship 
between auditory evoked potential and sound 
stimuli by using spectral analysis and fractal theory.  
However, the complexity of EEG data 
necessitated us to integrate many analytical skills. 
The only bottleneck we are facing today is its speed. 
It is not fast enough in applications of sensor 
networks. The purpose of this year’s project is to 
devise fast algorithms that are combined with 
stochastic analysis and spectral analysis so that 
accurate and fast processing of important 
information in signals that contains physiological 
functions can be achieved.  
 
Keywords: spectral measure analysis, fractal theory 
neural engineering.  
 
二、緣由與目的 
 
Spectral estimation methods are important and 
useful in the general field of signal processing. In 
the area of digital signal processing, similar studies 
are sometimes called the estimating parameters of 
multiple sinusoids in noise [1-6]. In general, the 
estimation methods can be divided into two classes: 
parametric and nonparametric [7-10]. The 
parametric method is also called the model-based 
method. However, this approach suffers from the 
drawbacks that either the dimension of the space or 
the number of sinusoid signals has to be given a 
priori. Unfortunately, such information are usually 
lacking in the real applications. 
On the other hand, the often used Fourier [11], 
[12] and periodogram-based methods [13-15] are 
nonparametric.  Even though they have no 
aforementioned drawbacks, yet they may suffer 
from high error-probability in spectral estimation. 
The reasons for these shortcomings are manifold. 
The main one is due to the fact that for short-term 
wide-sense stationary process, its spectral 
distribution function actually contains three parts 
[16]. The first part is called the discrete component, 
the second part is singular component, and the third 
part is absolutely continuous component. If the first 
two parts are absent, then the power spectral density 
exists. However, the first part will in general 
contribute to the emergence of spectral rhythms 
while the second part is not that important. Hence, 
it is essential to develop a fast and low 
error-probability estimation method in extracting 
power spectra without excluding any one of the 
three components. Researches along this line have 
been investigated for some time [17-18]. However, 
these studies have concentrated on the summation 
of power spectral density in order to represent the 
“spectral distribution function”. The discrete part 
was still not taken into account at the outset. 
Recently, the bona fide spectral distribution 
function has been proposed in calculating the fractal 
dimension [19]. However, the drawback was its 
high computational cost. In this paper, based on the 
same idea of spectral measure, a fast and accurate 
spectral distribution function algorithm (SDFA) not 
at the expense of its computational speed will be

such sampling, the discrete components of the SDF 
can stand out above the rest.  
Next, we try to reduce the computational 
complexity by

and Eq. (8) is then represented as:

algorithms of FFT with the assignment of 
ˆ (0) 0SR = . As a result, the computational 
complexity of this algorithm now is also of the 
same order ( )log( )O n n  as FFT. The complexity 
is much improved as compared to that of [19]. 
Finally, the spectral frequency estimates can be 
obtained as increments of this spectral distribution

This whole derivation procedure will be 
designated as the SDFA in the following paragraphs. 
In order to emphasize our main ideas, Fig. 1 is 
illustrated. In Fig. 1a, three points of discontinuity 
in SDF are shown. For this SDF, the jump is h for 
each discontinuity and 1λ , 2λ , 3λ  and 4λ  are 
four sampling points.  The SDF is continuous at 
1λ , 3λ  and 4λ , but discontinuous at 2λ . If one 
of our sampling points is at 2λ , the SDF at 2λ  
will be the average of h and 2h. As a result, the 
spectral density at 2λ  is the difference 
( ) ( ) ( ) 2/ˆˆˆ 122 hFFF =λ−λ=λΔ . Clearly, this is a 
bad sampling point and will not be able to exhibit 
the true height h. In addition, the value 
( ) ( ) ( ) 2/ˆˆˆ 233 hFFF =λ−λ=λΔ  will also be 
erroneous because the true difference should be 0. 
If two points 3λ  and 4λ  of continuity are used, 
the discrete component near 3λ  with jump h can 
be accurately captured by our SDFA. Figure 1b 
shows the simulation result of SDF that contains 
three sine waves buried under white noise; and 
 
Fig. 1 
Fig. 1c shows its corresponding differenced 
SDF. It is clear that the three peaks of power 
spectral density at 0.3, 0.612, and 0.802 Hz are 
clearly exhibited. 
 
三、結果與討論 
 
The performance of these three different 
methods is illustrated in this section by analyzing 
synthesized sinusoidal waves adding different 
levels of noise contamination. Our simulation is 
executed on an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 2.4 GHz 
machine with MATLAB software. The simulated 
noisy signal can be represented as:
