effect will be alleviated because MTs always locate 
at the center cell of an LA whenever a new location 
update is performed. Finally, the scheme can be 
implemented in a distributed manner so the computing 
time incurred by frequent replannings can be reduced. 
Simulation results show that our scheme indeed 
exhibits excellent results.

unnecessary location updates [12], [19], [23], [29]. Dynamic LAPs are proposed to 
allow an individual MT to overcome the shortcomings in the static schemes and 
minimize location management costs. Basically, dynamic schemes plan the LAs and 
determine their size dynamically according to the MT’s mobility and call arrival rate. 
Thus, the location management cost for each MT is optimized. Some well-known 
dynamic schemes are distance-based [7], [22], [34], movement-based [2], [7], [13], 
[16], [17] time-based [15], [25] and profile-based [9], [27], [28], [31]. Several studies 
[6], [24], [27], [28], [31] have indicated that, among dynamic schemes, profile-based 
schemes incur the lowest location management cost. However, more recent researches 
[6], [20], [27], [33] have pointed out that the existing PCS systems make it difficult to 
plan LAs for individual MTs because the huge number of MTs results in many 
additional costs. As a result, the dynamic schemes cannot be easily implemented in 
currently-operating PCS networks. 
Bejerano et al. [6] point out that people usually stay in specific zones for long 
periods until their work or activity in the zone is complete. For example, students and 
teachers stay in their campus during the day; tourists visit scenic spots for a given 
duration; doctors and patients usually spend most of their time in the hospital and the 
surrounding area. Location management would be more efficient if LAs could be 
intelligently partitioned and mapped into specific zones. To exploit Bejerano’s 
observation, recent researches, [6] and [8], propose new LAP schemes to efficiently 
divide cells into LAs. Most of the proposed schemes treat the inter-cell crossing rate 
as one of the key factors for determining the optimal cell set. As for the inter-cell 
crossing rate, merely counting the number of crossing MTs between cells is too 
simple to reflect real conditions and may lead to an unsatisfactory outcome in some 
cases. In the following section, we illustrate this paradox by example. 
In Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, the central concept of mobility 
management is automatic reconfiguration [1]. An intelligent LAP scheme should 
adapt to changeable user distributions and mobility patterns, and perform the 
replanning of LAs dynamically and frequently. Most proposed schemes are designed 
according to centralized techniques requiring more computing time for LA planning. 
The situation would be worse as frequent replannings are needed to accommodate the 
changeable environment. 
In this project, we propose a distributed cell-centric neighborhood-related LAP 
scheme to minimize location management costs while alleviate the ping-pong effect. 
The basic idea behind our scheme is that each cell acts as the center of an LA and 
bundles highly correlative neighbor cells into the LA. Cells with highly correlative 
relations have the lower location management costs. As stated above, we will use the 
LA residence time (LART) instead of the inter-cell crossing rate. In other words, we 
want to find a neighboring cell to be included in the LA if the average residence time 
of MTs dwelled within the area between the neighboring cell and the LA is longest. 
Moreover, the ping-pong effect will be alleviated because an MT always locates at the 
center of a new LA whenever a new location update is performed. Finally, the scheme 
can be implemented by a distributed method because each cell plans its own LA and 
only needs to know its neighbors’ information, reducing the computing time incurred 
by frequent replannings. Through simulations we will demonstrate the efficiency of 
our LAP scheme. 
  The rest of this project is organized as follows. Related works are introduced 
in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the system model and the proposed cell-centric 
neighborhood-related LAP scheme. Simulation results with different cell topologies 
are shown in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.

take the rate of inter-cell traffic between two cells as the inter-cell crossing rate and 
give high preference to binding the two cells in an attempt to reduce the update rate. 
Many transportation systems, highways, railways, and rapid transit systems present 
two-way directional traffic. Usually, it is very heavy about the inter-cell traffic 
between two neighboring cells located at the line of transportation systems. In other 
words, the more inter-cell traffic two cells have, the stronger the attraction with which 
they should be bound into an LA. This may result in the formation of a large LA in the 
area of transportation systems. However, high inter-cell traffic also happens while 
people quickly pass through those cells. For example, passengers on an urban rapid 
transit system pass many stations without getting off the train before arriving at their 
destinations, resulting in a larger location management cost because a large LA is 
easily formed but passengers may stay for only a short time. The relevance of two 
cells should take into account whether the same group of people has stayed in these 
cells for long enough to derive a benefit from the reduced update cost for covering the 
increased paging cost. We will demonstrate this paradox through simulations. 
 
3. Distributed Cell-centric Area-related LAP Scheme 
In this section, our distributed cell-centric neighborhood-related LAP scheme is 
presented in detail. Section 3.1 introduces the basic concept of the scheme. Section 
3.2 presents the system model in detail and derives the expected location management 
cost of an LAi. Section 3.3 presents our proposed scheme. 
 
3.1 Design Concept 
The design concept of our proposed LAP scheme is that each cell acts as the 
center of an LA and groups highly correlative neighboring cells into the LA if the 
cells and the center cell cover the same specific zone. Cells in a specific zone will be 
highly correlated to each other in the sense that once MTs move into the specific zone 
they will stay long enough time to reduce the location update cost, thus reducing 
location management costs. The proposed scheme can be implemented by a 
distributed method because each cell plans its own LA and only needs to know its 
neighbors’ information.  
Towards this end, each cell works as the first member of its own LA and 
evaluates the benefit of each neighbor cell. The benefit between the LA and a 
neighbor cell is the reduced location update cost subtracts the increased paging cost if 
the LA includes the neighbouring cell. Location update cost is reduced because a 
correlated cell is added into the LA but the paging cost increases because the cell 
paging number is raised. The former attracts a cell to be added into its LA and the 
latter confines the LA expansion. Below, we model the function of location 
management cost, show how a cell evaluates the benefit and demonstrate how our 
LAP scheme works. 
 
3.2 Modeling location management cost 
The parameters of the model are as follows.  
Cp = cost for paging a single cell  
Cu = location update cost  
LAi = LA i centered at cell i  
n = number of the cells in the system  
λi = incoming call arrival rate of an MT in cell i  
ti = the expected time of an MT stayed in LAi  
= the probability of the MT found in cell j being within LAi

In our scheme, each cell works as the first member of its own LA and evaluates 
the benefit of neighbouring cells to decide which neighbor presents the greatest 
benefit for inclusion in the LA. Below, we show how to calculate the benefit between 
LAi and a neighbor cell k. Let               The mobility management cost of LAi 
can be calculated by using (1). For    , the mobility management cost is calculated

So, when △Ck < 0, it is beneficial to include cell k into LAi; otherwise, it is not 
worth adding cell k into LAi. 
 
3.3 Proposed algorithm 
In our scheme, each cell acts as the first member of its own LA, and each time 
the LA includes the neighbor cell with the best benefit among all neighbors, i.e., the 
one with the smallest value △Ck as calculated by (10). The proposed scheme is 
performed until △Ck0, for all neighbors k. The formal steps are given as below. 
Note that the scheme will be executed by each cell to form its LA. 
Step 1: Cell i includes itself as the first member of LAi, i.e.,  
Step 2: For all k neighbors, calculate    .  
Step 3: Select k with the smallest 
     
from all neighbors of LAi. 
Step 4: If        ,                 , go to Step 2;  
otherwise output LAi and terminate the procedure. 
In the following, an example is given to see how the above LAP algorithm works. 
Fig. 2 shows that six cells are located in three specific zones, i.e., campus (cells 4 and 
5), hospital (cells 2 and 3), business area (cell 0), and highway (cell 1) connecting the 
hospital and the business area. The number attached to each arrow represents the 
transition probability of crossing the cell boundary per the transition time period e. 
Assume that Cp: Cu = 1:5. Following the benefit function (10) and the LAP scheme, 
Table 1 shows each LAi’s step by step expansion while the dotted boxes are marked as 
the final partitions for all LAi.

Fig. 3 Ring topology 
Fig. 3 uses the ring topology which can be thought as a public transit system 
while Fig. 4 uses the zone topology which is modeled as an area with some specific 
zones, such as school, hospital, and shopping mall. The parameter e used in (7), i.e., 
the time period between two state transitions, is set to 5 minutes. Assume that the 
incoming call arrival rate of an MT follows the Poisson distribution with mean time 
0.83 calls/hour. Each simulation result is the average of 10 times and each time runs 
24 hours. The different populations and Cu/Cp ratios are examined by the following 
two simulations. 
 
Fig. 4 Specific zone topology. 
 
4.1 Population Effect 
In the first simulation, the population effect is investigated. The cost ratio of 
Cu/Cp is fixed at 5. The relation between population and total location management 
cost about the two topologies are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The detailed numerical 
results are shown in Table 2 and 3. We can see that the times to perform location 
update and paging increase as more MTs present in the system. Although the more 
MTs incur the higher total location management cost, our proposed scheme still 
presents less cost than NBIP about 20%~30% no matter what population and topology 
are used. The first reason is that the cell-centric LAP alleviates the ping-pong effect. 
Before going to explain the second reason, we give an interesting phenomenon that 
the reducing ratios in ring topology are always better than in specific topology as 
shown in Table 2 and 3. The ring topology is to simulate that people always move in 
one direction and shows the shortcoming in NBIP algorithm. As stated in Sec. 2, 
NBIP considers the inter-cell crossing rate between cells as the location update rate 
such that the more inter-cell crossing rate the two cells have, the more attraction they 
should be bound into an LA. But the idea is not entirely correct in some cases. For 
example, the highly inter-cell crossing rate may also happen while people just pass 
through those cells quickly with small residence time. This is very similar to the 
scenario that passengers take a train of the rapid transit system in a city and pass many 
stations without getting off the train before arriving at their destinations. This case 
results in a higher location management cost because NBIP form a large LA easily but 
10 
 
    In the second simulation, we adjust the ratio of Cu/Cp to investigate the effect of 
the two algorithms. The population for this simulation is fixed at 1000 MTs. As 
shown in Fig. 7 and 8 as well as Table 4 and 5, the cost of the two algorithms grows 
as the ratio Cu/Cp increases. This is because that the larger ratio magnifies the location 
update cost and give cells to forming large LAs more easily. Thus the cost will 
approach the paging maximum as all of cells form only one large LA. Table 6 and 7 
show the LA planning results of the two topologies. From the results, NBIP have a 
trend to form one largest LA more quickly than ours as the Cu/Cp ratio increases. The 
reason is same as the previous simulation that NBIP with using the factor of inter-cell 
crossing rate forms a large LA more easily. This is more obvious in the ring topology. 
Thus, our algorithm always presents the lower cost than NBIP.

5. Conclusions 
In this project, we propose a new location management scheme to plan the LA 
through cell-centric LAP which can alleviate the ping-pong effect and minimize the 
total location management cost. To the best our knowledge, the idea of cell-centric 
location area planning, which is a tradeoff between static and dynamic LAPs, has not 
previously appeared in the literature. The proposed cost function used in our scheme 
is a distributed method which can be executed independently and concurrently at 
every cell, significantly reducing time complexity and cost. We show how the 
incoming arrival call rate, location update rate, and the ratio of Cu/Cp affect the 
performance in location management. Simulations results indicate the proposed 
algorithm outperforms NBIP for various populations and ratios of Cp /Cu.

AN INDOOR CALIBRATION-FREE LOCATION ESTIMATION
FOR DYNAMIC RADIO FREQUENCY ENVIRONMENTS

One of the most common techniques for the location estimation of
mobile users (MU) is the radio frequency (RF) site survey. The main idea
of the technique is to build a signal strength model, called a radio map, in
the off-line phase and to estimate the location of an MU by finding the
best match from the radio map in the on-line phase. However, when sig-
nal strength values vary frequently due to the characteristics of
environmental dynamics, the radio map will quickly become outdated,
and recalibration requires considerable manual effort. A good position-
ing technique should be able to adapt to a dynamically changing
environment. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation
of a positioning system which can provide low-cost, but highly adapt-
able and precise positioning in the context of changeable indoor
environments . Instead of constructing a radio map, we use reference
points (RP) installed in the localization area to continuously monitor
changes in the environment. We then employ the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) method to estimate the location of the MU. Experimental
results show that the average error distance is under four meters.
1. Introduction
Thanks to tremendous advances in wireless access techniques and mobile
computing devices, intense interest has developed in location-based serv-
ices. The rapidly expanding demand for indoor/outdoor location-based
services has created a great need for high-precision location estimation
techniques. In wireless networks, the most common technique used in
location estimation is the RF site survey [1–6]. As shown in Fig. 1, the pro-

results are provided in section 4 and, finally, concluding remarks are pre-
sented in section 5.
2. Related Work
In this section, we review two calibration-free algorithms most closely
related to our work. The first is called Signal Strength Weighted Centroid
(SSWC) [9], in which the estimation of an MU location is calculated by
weighing the coordinates of the AP locations according to their RSS val-
ues as received by the MU. The basic idea of SSWC is simple and can
be expressed by the following equation. Let SAPn and LAPn be the APn’s
RSS and coordinates respectively. The estimated location of the MU, Lˆ
calculated as Lˆ = [(SAP1/∑)LAP1 + (SAP2/∑)LAP2 + … + (SAPn/∑)LAPn],
where ∑ = SAP1 + SAP2 + … + SAPn, the sum of the signal strengths of
the APs.
The second algorithm [8] is called Proximity in Signal Space (PSS)
which uses inter-AP RSS measurements along with interpolation and
extrapolation to estimate the MU’s location. At each time unit, each AP
records the RSSs received from all other APs and conducts several map-
ping functions, each representing the RSS value and the corresponding
distance between itself and the neighbor AP. Each of the mapping func-
tions are assumed with a loglinear scale, i.e., RSS vs. distance curve is
roughly a straight line since the received signal strength in log scale
(measured with dBm) decays linearly with increasing range. An MU
uses the mapping functions of the AP with the strongest RSS to calculate
the distances to all the APs except the AP with the strongest RSS, and
then uses the function of the AP with the second strongest RSS to calcu-
late the distance to the AP with the strongest RSS. Finally, the algorithm
use the proportional method of interpolation and extrapolation, called
Triangular Interpolation and eXtrapolation (TIX), to estimate the MU’s loca-
tion. We use an example to illustrate the operation of TIX. In Fig. 2, P1,
P2, and P3 are the coordinates of three APs while d1, d2, and d3 are the cal-
culated distances between the MU and the three APs by using the
mapping functions. Eqs. (1) and (2) are used to obtain the positions D1,
D2, and D3.
Figure 2 is used for the methods of interpolation and extrapolation. If
|P1P2| ≥ d1, the coordinates of D1 in Fig. 2 are calculated by Eq. (1),

3.1. Radio path loss model and signal strength differences
Since this paper focuses on the implementation of an indoor positioning
system, we usually refer to the logarithm distance path loss model [2, 10] as
the primary path loss model, which is expressed in Eq. (4)
(4)
where d is distance between a transmitter and a receiver, d0 is 1 meter
away from a transmitter, Lp(d) is the path loss at distance d, Lp(d0) is the
path loss at 1 meter away from a transmitter, and n is the path loss coef-
ficient. In this paper, a transmitter is any AP and a receiver is an MU or
any RP.
Finding the nearest distance between an MU and an RP requires the
path loss model of Eq. (4) to calculate the real distance between the MU
and RP to the same AP. Through the signal strength received from the MU
and RP, the real distance is estimated as shown in Eq. (5) which can be
deduced from Eq. (4).
(5)
After estimating the distance from the AP to the MU and RP, we sub-
tract these distances to obtain the difference. This difference needs to be
calculated for each AP and then summed to obtain the difference of received
signal strengths (DSS), which represents the total distance differences of
the MU and RP with respect to all APs. The smaller the DSS value, the
closer the MU will be to the RP.  The calculation of DSSMU_RPj is shown in
Eq. (6),
(6)
where RSSMU_APi  is the signal strength value of APi received by the MU
and RSSRPj_APi  is the signal strength value of APi received by RPj.
The algorithm proposed in the next subsection requires the estimated
distance between the RPs, DSSs between each pair of RPs, and DSSs
between MU to all RPs to estimate the possible real distances between the
MU and RPs. Thus, aside from calculating the DSS between the MU to all
RPs, we must also calculate the DSSs between each pair of RPs.

Even with the known distances between the MU and RPs, we still face
a problem in the real environment that three circles may not intersect at
one point, as shown as Fig. 4.
To overcome this problem, we use a minimum mean square estimate
to figure out the minimum distances from the MU to those three circles.
In Eq. (8), fk (x, y) represents the shortest distance from a possible location
of the MU at coordinate (x, y), to the circumference centered at RPk.
(8)
(9)
In Eq. (9), F(x, y) is the sum of the square of the m shortest distances.
Finally, the location of the MU is the coordinate (x, y) such that F(x, y)
has the minimum value by solving the equations, F(x,y)/∂x = 0 and
F(x,y)/∂x = 0.
4. Empirical Evaluation
To evaluate empirical performance, we implemented a prototype system
which includes 7 APs (Buffalo WHR-G54S), 7 RPs (Proxim Orinoco 8470-
WD used as RP wireless network card), and an MU (Proxim Orinoco
8470-WD). The system was deployed on our department office at 4th floor
of an office building as shown in Fig. 5. The evaluation focuses on the
localization errors for MMRP, SWCC, and TIX.
Table 1 shows the average error distances. MMRP, with the smallest
error value, provides the highest accuracy because we use the signal
received by the MU to compare the most similar RPs and use the com-
parisons to process localization calculations. 
Figure 6 shows the cumulative distribution probability of localization
errors with different meters. Apparently, MMRP is superior to TIX and

installed in the localization area to continuously monitor changes in the
environment. We then use the MMSE to estimate the MU’s location.
Experimental results show that MMRP offers greater accuracy than other
methods, with an average error distance of less than 4 meters.
