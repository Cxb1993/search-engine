Abstract 
The study integrates the resonance principle of 
quantum physics and random walks concept to analyze 
the image multi-understandings. The quantum model of 
the photo and bounded electron interaction is recruited 
to simulate the machine image understanding problems. 
The pixel or the unit cell of the image will be resonance 
when the pixel or the unit cell satisfied the given quantum 
condition. Besides, the random walk concept is 
introduced to choose which area of the image will be 
proceeded the resonance process. Basically, the different 
sampling patterns will introduce the multiple 
comprehensions. The properties of resonance map; e.g. 
spatial isotropic, spatial homogenous, geometric 
condition, gray level distribution; could be taken as the 
significant features to identify the resonance status. In 
simulation, the combined characters C, O, Chinese 
character "jade", and "king" are employed. The results 
reveal the different sampling patterns can lead multi 
resonance outputs.  
 
1. Introduction 
Human beings' vision is a complex processing 
including optical image formation, nerve interaction, 
and brain activity [1-4]. On the other hand, computer 
vision attempts to construct the system or algorithm 
as the industrial applications and etc [5]. Clearly, 
two vision systems have its benefits and 
disadvantages; e.g. the vision of human beings can 
extract the "meanings" well from a painting but the 
robot could "see" a very tiny defeat from the IC 
image. 
Moreover, there are usually different 
comprehensions extracted from a same figure to a 
human. For example, we have the experience that 
the Chinese character will become strange when we 
look at the character during the long time interval. In 
a viewpoint, the phenomenon is similar to the 
over-training of computer machine [5]. The article 
proposed another viewpoint that the pattern of the 
viewer sensing is decided by the sampling pattern of 
viewer incident. That means the viewer could take 
the different key (sampling pattern) to open the 
different door (sensing pattern).  
Basically, the process of human recognition is 
with some uncertainty but confined [1, 2, 6]. Monte 
Carlo method is a general approach to solve 
complex, nonlinear, or uncertain problems that based 
on large numbers of random variables [7]. And the 
uncertainty is the intrinsic property of quantum 
mechanics [8]. Therefore, to reserve both properties 
of uncertainty [9] and confinement, the quantum 
mechanics and Monte Carlo methods are employed 
in the article [10, 11]. The resonance concept [12, 13] 
is used to simulate the different respondent images 
from an image. Based on the concept, the 
meaningful selection of pattern recognition becomes 
practicable.  
In addition, there are two assumptions in 
multi-interpretations in accessing the same pattern. 
One is based on the gray-level classifications. 
Viewers predict the gray level distribution of the 
pattern before sensing that. And the resonance image 
would be responded according to the viewers’ 
perditions. Another is based on human’s visual 
attention. Viewer would have more sensing at 
particular location of the image. Human’s vision 
usually has some focus on some particular positions 
on the image when viewing. This mechanism could 
be called as fixation in eye movement [2, 3, 14, 15]. 
The effect is similar to a spotlight projecting on the 
image, or a mask on the image. 2D Gaussian profile 
was used to model the single visual attention point 
in simulation.  
The methods combine the resonance with 
random-walk concept and the two assumptions 
apply in this article. 
 
2. Methods 
For clear illustration, the proposed concept is 
revealed in Figure 1. The different sampling patterns 
will interact with the testing image and acquire the 
 4 
Gaussian photon casting was applied with 
single-gray-level character images (Figure 10.). 
Two images on Figure 4 show the 2D 
probability density functions of two photon casting. 
Lighter pattern represents the position drawn more 
times, and darker represents mean the position 
drawn less times. As we noted, Gaussian is 
concentrated at the center, and Uniform is almost 
constant within the ellipse.

photon casting conditions. Left is uniform distribution. 
Right is Gaussian distribution. 
 
2.3. Pixels Resonance 
Suppose are the incident photon energy of n state 
and bounded energy of the electron with position (x, 
y), respectively. According to quantum mechanics, 
the energy difference between En and I(x,y) is closer, 
the resonance probability is greater. So we have to 
choose a critical resonance condition; i.e. threshold; 
to make the resonance criterion. 
We assume that En is N(En,σ
2
), which is Gaussian 
random variable with mean En and variance σ
2
. And 
we set a threshold for single state resonance 
criterion.In summary, the criterion of resonance 
condition can be written as follows:

Where I(x,y) is the gray level at image coordinates 
(x,y) and En' is a random variable of Gaussian 
distribution of gray levels, and T is threshold for 
single resonance criterion, and R(x,y) is pixels 
resonance map.

3. Results 
 
3.1 Resonance with Uniformly Random Casting 
To verify the proposed algorithm validation, 
two testing patterns generated. One is the alphabet 
“C”, which gray level is 180, and added darker gray 
level scaled 140 at the gap, so that the image is 
ambiguous with alphabet “C” and “O”. Another one 
is the Chinese character “king”, which gray-scaled is 
180, and added darker gray levels at the 
bottom-right, so that the image is ambiguous with 
 6 
simulation in 3.1 and this simulation is the 
probability density functions of photon casting and 
the testing patterns. The simulation in 3.1 applies 
uniform casting, and the testing patterns have three 
gray-levels (0, 140, and 180, Figure 6). 2D Gaussian 
random casting applied in this simulation and the 
testing pattern has only two gray-levels (0, 
180,Figure 10).

The character is 180 gray scaled with black background. 
 
We use three different 2D Gaussian profiles as 
the different visual attentions on the testing pattern. 
Three 2D Gaussian distributions are shown in left 
column of Figure 11. And the iterations of proposed 
algorithm are concerned. Figure 11 shows the effect 
of different iterations with three 2D Gaussian 
patterns.

character jade or king. The images of first column 
represent three Gaussian distribution. The 
resonance images of right three columns represent 
the results with different iterations, which sampling 
energy are 180, standard deviation are 5, and 
threshold are 10.  
In addition, four different standard deviations 
of the casting photon energy are recruited in 
simulation. The preliminary result is shown in 
Figure 12.

deviations, and the sampling energy is 180, threshold is

4. Discussion 
 
From Figure 7 and Figure 8, the results show that the 
resonance images were mainly depending on the 
sampling pattern. Clearly, the "C" and "king" will be 
resonated when the incident sampling energy is 200. 
On the contrary, there are no meaningful words 
resonated when trigger energy is equal to 120. When 
we choose the middle energy, the resonance maps 
could be changed that we can see the "O" and "jade" 
in the case. Principally, the results reveal that the 
proposed concept and prediction is reasonable. That 
means the desired comprehensions will depend on 
the given conditions. 
Figure 7 and Figure 8 also show the some 
differences between the resonance images of clear 
images and noisy images. Due to the random casting, 
we found that the resonance points of noisy images 
are more. 
The effect of different variances of the sampling 
energy could be obtained from Figure 9 and Figure 
12. At the first image of Figure 9, the images were 
not so clear to identify. We think that is the too 
narrow bandwidth effect of random Gaussian pattern. 
By choosing suitable bandwidth; that means the 
middle range; the corresponding resonance could 
reserve the characters. However, the image will blur 
and hard to recognize when the sampling range is

二、與會心得 
本次 International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering，ICACTE 會
議是第三屆舉行，主要探討電腦運算和相關應用等主題，可使世界各國在電腦運算應用領域的研
究者，共同探討新的技術領域與交流。依據本次參與會議，特別提出以下心得： 
1. 參與者大多來自中國，僅有 1/3左右是外國與會者，由於此時正值成都遭遇嚴重水患問題，
因此有不少的報告者缺席。 
2. 對於大陸地區的參加者，積極、認真的聆聽報告留下深刻印象。 
3. 本次研討會方向，有許多聚焦在最佳化處理應用主題，屬於比較廣泛性的電腦院算研究探討，
因此對於影像處理或訊號處理等研究，內容著墨不深。 
4. 非常感謝國科會的經費補助，能夠藉此機會與各國人士進行交流。
