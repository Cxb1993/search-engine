and end conditions, proper selection of appropriate 
lamination to maximize the fundamental frequency of 
the curved panels becomes a crucial problem. 
     Research on the subject of structural 
optimization has been reported by many investigators. 
However, in spite of the high potential for improved 
dynamic performance of fiber-composite laminate 
structures by utilizing the optimization techniques, 
there has not been very much activity in this area, 
especially for composite laminated curved panels 
subjected to axial compressive force. To fill this 
gap, maximization of the fundamental natural 
frequency for composite laminated curved panels 
subjected to uniaxial compressive loading with 
respect to fiber orientations is performed by using 
the golden section method. The influence of axial 
compressive force, end condition, aspect ratio and 
curvature on the optimal fiber orientations, the 
maximum fundamental natural frequency and the 
associated fundamental vibration mode of the 
composite laminated curved panels are studied and 
investigated.

and Juang, 1997; Hu and Tsai, 1999; Hu and Ou, 2001; Hu and Tsai, 2009), and
compressive forces (Dhanaraj and Palanininathan, 1990; Chen, Cheng, Chien and
Doong, 2002; Nayak, Moy and Shenoi, 2005; Chakrabarti, Topdar and Sheikh,
2006; Hu and Tsai, 2009). Therefore, proper selection of appropriate lamination
to maximize the fundamental frequency of composite laminated curved panels in
compression becomes a crucial problem (Bert, 1991; Abrate, 1994; Raouf, 1994;
Topal and Uzman, 2006).
Research on the subject of structural optimization has been reported by many in-
vestigators (Schmit, 1981) and has been widely employed to study the dynamic
behavior of composite structures (Abrate, 1994; Hu, and Ho, 1996; Hu and Juang,
1997; Hu and Tsai, 1999; Hu and Ou, 2001; Narita, 2003; Topal and Uzman, 2006;
Hu and Wang, 2007; Hu and Tsai, 2009). Among various optimization schemes,
the golden section method is a simple technique and can be easily programmed for
solution on the computer (Vanderplaats, 1984; Haftka, Gürdal and Kamat, 1990).
In this investigation, maximization of the fundamental natural frequency of com-
posite laminated curved panels in compression with respect to fiber orientations is
performed by using the golden section method. The fundamental frequencies of
composite laminated curved panels are calculated by using the Abaqus finite el-
ement program (Abaqus, Inc., 2010). In the paper, the constitutive equations for
fiber-composite lamina, vibration analysis and golden section method are briefly re-
viewed. The influences of the end conditions, the panel aspect ratio, the panel cur-
vature and the compressive force on the maximum fundamental natural frequency
and the associated optimal fiber orientations of the laminated curved panels are
presented and important conclusions obtained from the study are given.
2 Constitutive matrix for fiber-composite laminae
In the finite element analysis, the laminated cylindrical shells are modeled by eight-
node isoparametric shell elements with six degrees of freedom per node (three
displacements and three rotations). The reduced integration rule together with
hourglass stiffness control is employed to formulate the element stiffness matrix
(Abaqus, Inc., 2010).
During the analysis, the constitutive matrices of composite materials at element
integration points must be calculated before the stiffness matrices are assembled
from element level to global level. For fiber-composite laminate materials, each
lamina can be considered as an orthotropic layer. The stress-strain relations for a
lamina in the material coordinate (1,2,3) (Fig. 1) at an element integration point
can be written as
{σ ′}= [Q′1]{ε ′}, {τ ′}= [Q′2]{γ ′} (1)

3 Vibration analysis
For the free vibration analysis of an undamped structure, the equation of motion of
the structure can be written in the following form (Cook, Malkus, Plesha and Witt,
2002):
[M]{D¨} + [K]{D} = {0} (7)
where {D} is a vector for the unrestrained nodal degrees of freedoms, {D¨} an
acceleration vector, [M] the mass matrix of the structure, [K] the stiffness matrix
of the structure, and {0} a zero vector. Since {D} undergoes harmonic motion, we
can express
{D}= {D¯}sinωt; {D¨} = −ω2{D¯}sinωt (8)
where {D¯} vector contains the amplitudes of {D} vector. Then Eq. (7) can be
written in an eigenvalue expression as
([K]−ω2[M]){D¯} = {0} (9)

Let τ be a number between 0 and 1. We can define the interior points X1 and X2 to
be
X1 = (1− τ)XL+ τXU (15a)
X2 = τXL+(1− τ)XU (15b)
Substituting Eqs. (15a) and (15b) into Eq. (14), we obtain
τ2−3τ+1 = 0 (16)
Solving the above equation, we obtain τ = 0.38197. The ratio (1−τ)/τ = 1.61803
is the famous “golden section” number. For a problem involving the estimation of
the maximum of a one-variable function F, we need only minimize the negative of
the function, that is, minimize -F.

Figure 3: Geometry and boundary conditions of laminated curved panels
Figure 4 shows the optimal fiber angle θ and the associated optimal fundamental
frequency ω versus the circular angle φ for [±θ/90/0]2s laminated curved panel
with aspect ratio a/b = 1 and with simply supported edge conditions. From Fig. 4a
we can see that the axial compressive force N has little influence on the optimal
fiber angle θ of the laminated curved panels except the case φ = 150o and N =
0.8Ncr. The optimal fiber angle θ of those panels usually varies between 40o and
70o and increases with the increasing of the circular angle φ . When φ = 5o, the

Figure 12 shows the optimal fiber angle θ and the associated optimal fundamental
frequency ω versus aspect ratio a/b for [±θ/90/0]2s laminated curved panels with
φ = 60o and with simply supported conditions. From Fig. 12a we can see that
the axial compressive force N does have some influence on the optimal fiber angle
θ of the laminated curved panels when the aspect ratio is large (say a/b ≥ 0.8).
The optimal fiber angle increases with the increasing of the compressive force and
usually varies between 60o and 70o. When a/b = 0.5, the optimal fiber angle θ
of the laminated curved panels are all equal to 67o and seem to be independent
on the axial compressive forces. Figure 12b shows that the optimal fundamental
frequency ω decreases with the increasing of the aspect ratio a/b and decreases with
the increasing of the axial compressive force. Figure 13 shows the fundamental
vibration modes of those curved panels with φ = 60o and under optimal fiber angle
θ . Again, it can be seen that those modes are very similar.
Figure 14 shows the optimal fiber angle θ and the associated optimal fundamental
frequency ω versus the circular angle φ for [±θ/90/0]2s laminated curved panel
with φ = 150o and with simply supported edge conditions. From Fig. 14a we can
see that the axial compressive force N has little influences on the optimal fiber angle
θ of the laminated curved panels when the aspect ratio is large (say a/b≥ 0.8). The
optimal fiber angle θ of those panels usually varies between 70o and 90o. When
the aspect ratio is large, the optimal fiber angle tends to approach constant value.
Figure 14b shows again that the optimal fundamental frequency ω decreases with
the increasing of the aspect ratio a/b and decreases with the increasing of the axial
compressive force. Comparing Fig. 14a with Fig. 12a, we can see that the circular
angle φ has significant influence on the optimal fiber angle of the laminated curved
panel. Comparing Fig. 14b with Fig. 12b, we can see that the optimal fundamental
frequencies of the curved panels with small circular angle are smaller than those
with large circular angle. Figure 15 shows the fundamental vibration modes of
those curved panels with φ = 150o under optimal fiber angle θ . Again, it can be
seen that those modes are very similar.
5.4 Fixed laminated curved panels with various aspect ratios and axial com-
pressive forces
In this section, laminated curved panels subjected to axial compressive force and
similar to those in previous section are analyzed except that the panels are fixed at
the four edges. The laminate layup of the laminated curved panel is still [±θ/90/0]2s.
Figure 16 shows the optimal fiber angle θ and the associated optimal fundamen-
tal frequency ω versus aspect ratio a/b for [±θ/90/0]2s laminated curved panels
with φ = 60o and with fixed conditions. From Fig. 16a we can see that the ax-
ial compressive force N does have some influence on the optimal fiber angle θ of

Optimization of Axially Compressed 
Laminated Curved Panels with Cutouts 
 
Hsuan-Teh Hu† and Hung-Wei Peng‡

Abstract 
Free vibration analyses of laminated curved panels with central circular cutouts and 
subjected to axial compressive forces are carried out by employing the Abaqus finite element 
program. The fundamental frequencies of these composite laminated curved panels with a given 
material system are then maximized with respect to fiber orientations by using the Golden 
section method. Through parametric studies, the significant influences of the panel aspect ratio, 
the panel curvature, the cutout size and the compressive force on the maximum fundamental 
frequencies, the optimal fiber orientations and the associated fundamental vibration modes of 
these panels are demonstrated and discussed. 
1. Introduction 
The applications of fiber-composite laminate materials to aerospace industrial such as 
spacecraft, high-speed aircraft and satellite have increased rapidly in recent years. The most 
major components of the aerospace structures are frequently made of curved panels with cutouts 
and subjected to various kinds of compressive forces. Therefore, knowledge of the dynamic 
characteristics of composite laminated curved panels with cutouts in compression, such as their 
fundamental natural frequency, is essential. 
The fundamental natural frequency of composite laminated curved panels highly depends 
on the ply orientations (Crawley, 1979; Chandrashekhara, 1989; Qatu and Leissa, 1991; Raouf, 
1994; Chun and Lam, 1995; Hu and Juang, 1997; Hu and Tsai, 1999; Hu and Ou, 2001; Hu and 
Tsai, 2009), geometries (Chandrashekhara, 1989; Qatu and Leissa, 1991; Hu and Juang, 1997; 
Hu and Tsai, 1999; Hu and Ou, 2001; Hu and Tsai, 2009), cutouts (Lee, Lim and Chow, 1987; 
Ramakrishna, Rao and Rao, 1992; Hu and Ho, 1996; Hu and Juang, 1997;  Sivakumara, Iyengara 
and Debb, 1998; Tenek, 2000; Liu, Jin and Li, 2006; Hu and Tsai, 2009) and compressive forces 
(Dhanaraj and Palanininathan, 1990; Chen, Cheng, Chien and Doong, 2002; Nayak, Moy and 
Shenoi, 2005; Chakrabarti, Topdar and Sheikh, 2006; Hu and Tsai, 2009). Therefore, proper

3. Vibration Analysis 
For the free vibration analysis of an undamped structure, the equation of motion of the 
 
5
upper bound. Repeating this process, we can narrow the bounds to whatever tolerance is desired. 
To determine the method for choosing the interior points 1X , 2X , 3X , ..., we pick the 
values of 1X  and 2X  to be symmetric about the center of the interval and satisfying the 
following expressions: 
U 2 1 LX X X X    (13) 
1 1L 2
1U L U
X X X X
X X X X
 
   (14) 
Let   be a number between 0 and 1. We can define the interior points 1X  and 2X  to be 
1 L UX (1 )X X     (15a) 
2 L UX X (1 )X      (15b) 
Substituting Eqs. (15a) and (15b) into Eq. (14), we obtain 
2 3 1 0      (16) 
Solving the above equation, we obtain 0.38197  . The ratio (1 ) / 1.61803     is the 
famous “golden section” number. For a problem involving the estimation of the maximum of a 
one-variable function F, we need only minimize the negative of the function, that is, minimize -F. 
5. Numerical Analysis 
The accuracy of the eight-node shell element in Abaqus program for frequency analysis 
has been verified by the authors (Hu and Tsai, 2009; Peng, 2010) and good agreements are 
obtained between the numerical results and the analytical solution or experimental data. Hence, it 
is confirmed that the accuracy of the shell element in Abaqus program is good enough to analyze 
the vibration behavior of laminated curved panels. 
In the following sections, simply supported laminated curved panels with central circular 
cutouts and subjected to various axial compressive forces N are considered (Fig. 3). The simply 
supported boundary condition prevents out of plane displacement w, but allows in-plane 
movements u and v. The meshes selected for the finite element analysis are based on the 
convergent studies performed by the author (Peng, 2010) and no symmetry simplifications are 
made for those laminated curved panels. In the analyses, the width b of the curved panel is equal 
to 10 cm. The cutout size d varies from 0 to 8 cm. The circular angle   varies from o5  to o120 . 
To study the influence of axial compressive force on the results of optimization, N = 0, ,crN2.0  
,crN4.0  ,crN6.0  and ,crN8.0 are selected, where crN  is the linearized critical buckling loads 
of the laminated curved panels. 
The lamina of the curved panels consists of Graphite/Epoxy and material constitutive

5.1.2 Panels with circular angle o60   
In this section, the aspect ratio a/b of the laminated curved panels is still equal to 1 but the 
circular angle   is changed to o60 . Figure 7 shows the influence of the cut size and axial 
compressive force on the optimal fiber angle of these panels. Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 4, we 
can observe that when the curvatures of these panels are increased, the optimal fiber angles are 
significantly influenced by the cutout size and axial compressive force.  
Figure 8 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force on the optimal 
fundamental frequency of these panels. It shows the similar trend as Fig. 5, i.e. the optimal 
fundamental frequency increases with the increasing of the cutout size and decreases with the 
increasing of the axial compressive force. However, we can notice that the optimal fundamental 
frequencies of laminated curved panels with large curvatures (Fig. 8) are higher than those with 
small curvatures (Fig. 5). 
Figure 9 shows the fundamental vibration modes of the typical laminated curved panels 
under optimal fiber angle condition. Again, all panels vibrate into a half sine wave in both 
longitudinal and circumferential directions. 
5.1.3 Panels with circular angle o120   
In this section, the aspect ratio a/b of the laminated curved panels is still equal to 1 but the 
circular angle   is changed to o120 . Figure 10 shows the influence of the cut size and axial 
compressive force on the optimal fiber angle of these panels. Comparing Fig. 10 with Figs. 7 and 
4, we can conclude that when the curvatures of laminated curved panels are large, the optimal 
fiber angles are significantly influenced by the cutout size and axial compressive force. 
Figure 11 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force on the optimal 
fundamental frequency of these panels. Comparing Fig. 11 with Figs. 8 and 5, we can conclude 
that the optimal fundamental frequency usually increases with the increasing of the cutout size 
and decreases with the increasing of the axial compressive force. Also, the optimal fundamental 
frequencies of laminated curved panels with large curvatures are higher than those with small 
curvatures. 
Figure 12 shows the fundamental vibration modes of the typical laminated curved panels 
under optimal fiber angle condition. Again, all panels vibrate into a half sine wave in both 
longitudinal and circumferential directions. 
5.2 Laminated curved panels with aspect ratio a/b = 2  
5.2.1 Panels with circular angle o5   
In this section, the laminated curved panels with aspect ratio a/b = 2 and circular angle 
 
9
5.2.3 Panels with circular angle o120   
In this section, the laminated curved panels with aspect ratio a/b = 2 and circular angle 
o120   are analyzed. Figure 19 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force 
on the optimal fiber angle of these panels. Comparing Fig. 19 with Figs. 16, 13 and 10, we can 
observe again that the optimal fiber angles are significantly influenced by the cutout size, axial 
compressive force, curvature and aspect ratio of the laminated curved panels. 
Figure 20 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force on the optimal 
fundamental frequency of these panels. It shows the similar trend as before. Comparing Fig. 20 
with Fig. 11, we can reconfirm that the optimal fundamental frequencies of laminated curved 
panels with large aspect ratios are lower than those with small aspect ratio. Comparing Fig. 20 
with Figs. 17 and 14, we can reconfirm that the optimal fundamental frequencies of laminated 
curved panels with large curvatures are higher than those with small curvatures. 
Figure 21 shows the fundamental vibration modes of the typical laminated curved panels 
under optimal fiber angle condition. It can be seen that all of the panels vibrate into a half sine 
wave in both longitudinal and circumferential directions. 
5.3 Laminated curved panels with aspect ratio a/b = 3 
5.3.1 Panels with circular angle o5   
In this section, the laminated curved panels with aspect ratio a/b = 3 and circular angle 
o5   are analyzed. Figure 22 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force 
on the optimal fiber angle of these panels. Comparing Fig. 22 with Figs. 13 and 4, we can 
observe again that when the aspect ratios of these panels are increased, the optimal fiber angles 
are significantly influenced by the cutout size and axial compressive force. 
Figure 23 shows the influence of the cut size and axial compressive force on the optimal 
fundamental frequency of these panels. It shows similar trend as Fig. 14. The optimal 
fundamental frequency initially decreases with the increasing of the cutout size. However, after a 
certain size of cutout has been reached, the optimal fundamental frequency starts to increases 
with the increasing of the cutout size. On the other hand, the optimal fundamental frequency still 
decreases with the increasing of the axial compressive force. Comparing Fig. 23 with Figs. 14 
and 5, we can conclude that the optimal fundamental frequencies of laminated curved panels 
with large aspect ratios are lower than those with small curvatures. 
Figure 24 shows the fundamental vibration modes of the typical laminated curved panels 
under optimal fiber angle condition. It can be seen that most of the panels vibrate into a half sine 
wave in both longitudinal and circumferential directions. However, for panels with or without 
cutout and subjected to high compressive force (say N 0.8Ncr ), their vibration modes may

6 Conclusions 
Based on the numerical results of this investigation, the following specific conclusions 
may be drawn: 
1. The optimal fiber angles of laminated curved panels are significantly influenced by the 
cutout size, axial compressive force, curvature and aspect ratio. However, for laminated curved 
panels with small aspect ratio (say a / b 1 ) and small curvature (say o5  ), the optimal fiber 
angles are not sensitive to the cutout size and axial compressive force. 
2. The optimal fundamental frequency of laminated curved panels usually increases with 
the increasing of the cutout size. However, for laminated curved panels with large aspect ratio 
(say a / b 2 ) and small curvature (say o5  ), the optimal fundamental frequency initially 
decreases with the increasing of the cutout size. After a certain size of cutout has been reached, 
the optimal fundamental frequency starts to increases with the increasing of the cutout size. 
3. The optimal fundamental frequency of laminated curved panels decreases with the 
increasing of the axial compressive force. 
4. The optimal fundamental frequencies of laminated curved panels with large aspect 
ratios are lower than those with small aspect ratios. 
5. The optimal fundamental frequencies of laminated curved panels with large curvatures 
are higher than those with small curvatures. 
6. Under the optimal fiber angle conditions, the laminated curved panels with or without 
cutouts usually vibrate into a half sine wave in both longitudinal and circumferential directions. 
However, for panels with small curvature (say o5  ), large aspect ratio (say a / b 2 ) and 
subjected to high compressive force (say N 0.8Ncr ), their vibration modes may have more half 
sine waves in the longitudinal direction.
