high-resolution TEM HRTEM JEM-2010, 200 kV. The ZnO thin
films deposited on glass substrate were prepared for TEM or
HRTEM observation by the precision ion polishing system, Ion Mil-
lion Gatan 691. Electrical resistivity of the films was measured us-
ing a four-terminal method. A digital ohmmeter Hioki equipped
with a pressing detection system Option QT50, electrode spacing
1 mm was used to evaluate the sheet resistance of the films, and the
electrical resistivity  of the films was calculated by multiplying
sheet resistance with the film thickness. The optical transmittance of
the films was measured using a UV/visible double-beam spectropho-
tometer Shimadz UV-1240.
Results and Discussion
XRD analysis.— Figure 1 displays the X-ray diffraction XRD
patterns of the undoped ZnO thin films, in which no distinct diffrac-
tion peak appears for the dried film prepared with ZnCl2 source, as
shown in Fig. 1a, and the XRD pattern of the dried film prepared
with ZnOAc2·2H2O source is similar to Fig. 1a. This indicates that
before the annealing treatment was applied, the films were in an
amorphous state. In contrast, all the films have a crystalline ZnO
phase with a hexagonal wurtzite structure after the annealing treat-
ment. The annealed ZnO films prepared with ZnCl2 and
ZnOAc2·2H2O labeled ZnOCl and ZnOOAc, respectively ex-
hibit three main peaks corresponding to the 100, 002, and 101
planes, along with small peaks for the 102, 110, 103, and 112
planes.
Figure 2 presents the XRD patterns of the Sn-doped ZnO films
prepared with ZnOAc2·2H2O and ZnCl2 labeled TZOOAc and
TZOCl, respectively. It can be seen that the same diffraction peaks
of the ZnO wurtzite structure appear in Fig. 2a and b, except that a
small and broad peak at 51.79° exists in the XRD pattern of the
TZOOAc film Fig. 2a. This peak corresponds to the 211 plane of
the SnO2 phase. The full width at half maximum fwhm of the
SnO2 211 peak is much broader than the ZnO peaks, suggesting
that the grain size of the SnO2 crystallites is very small compared
with the ZnO crystallites in the film. No diffraction peak of SnO2
could be detected in the XRD spectrum of the TZOCl film, imply-
ing that the content of SnO2 precipitates or clusters is small.

Figure 4 shows the FE-SEM images of the ZnO films prepared
with the ZnOAc2·2H2O source. The surface morphology Fig. 4a
of the dried ZnOOAc film without annealing is similar to that of the
dried ZnOCl thin film. Figures 4b-e display the plan-view and
cross-sectional images of the annealed ZnOOAc and TZOOAc
films. It can be seen that the annealed ZnO film is composed of
rounded grains throughout the entire film thickness, and some of the
grains have associated to form bigger ones for the film with Sn
doping see Fig. 4d and e. The measured film thickness is about
90 nm. The appearance of the ZnO films prepared using
ZnOAc2·2H2O source is clearly different from that prepared using
the ZnCl2 source.
To further understand the surface morphology of the ZnO films,
AFM analysis was carried out on the TZOCl and TZOOAc films.
The AFM images of the TZOCl and TZOOAc films are shown in
Fig. 5. Figure 5a indicates that large crystals with a particle size
ranging from 100 to 350 nm are surrounded by fine crystals from
which the root mean square rms surface roughness was measured
to be 29.87 nm. Figure 5b reveals that the TZOOAc film is com-
posed of relatively uniform crystallites with size of about 20 nm
and an rms surface roughness of 0.74 nm is obtained. The AFM
images demonstrate that the TZOCl films possess a very rough
surface containing both fine and large crystallites; however, the crys-
tallite size of the TZOOAc films is rather uniform and smooth. This
AFM result coincides with the FE-SEM observation.
Film composition.— EDS was conducted to obtain the composi-
tion of the prepared TZO films. The EDS spectra of the TZOCl and
TZOOAc films are given in Fig. 6, of which there exist Zn, Sn, O,
and Si. The Si peak originates from the glass substrate, whereas the
Zn, Sn, and O peaks come from the Sn-doped ZnO films. The rela-
tive concentrations of Sn in different regions of the films are listed
in Table II. It was found that the Sn/Zn atomic ratio acquired from
the small particles and the association grains of the TZOOAc film
are 5.2 and 5.3  10−2, respectively. This result indicates that the
TZOOAc film possesses a better homogeneous distribution of Sn,
and the measured composition is very close to the concentration of
Sn in the starting sol solution. The EDS data shows that the TZOCl
film has a higher Sn content in the region of the nanocrystal under-
layer than that of the large crystals. The Sn/Zn atomic ratio is about
3.2  10−2 in the nanocrystal layer and about 0.5  10−2 in the
large crystals. This result depicts that the Sn dopant has a strong
tendency to be captured in the region of the nanocrystal layer of the
TZOCl film.

diffraction spots corresponding to SnO2 200, 310, and 112
planes are also visible in the SAED pattern. The electron diffraction
pattern of the TZOOAc film is shown in Fig. 8c, in which sharp and
bright diffraction rings of the ZnO phase, as well as low intensity
and a diffuse ring corresponding to the SnO2 200 plane and a weak
spot matching with the reflection of the SnO2 310 plane are ob-
served. The electron diffraction clearly indicates that in both the
doped TZOCl and TZOOAc films, the ZnO polycrystalline phase is
present, along with a crystalline and an amorphous SnO2 structure.
The SAED of the large crystals in the TZOCl film is shown in
Fig. 8d, in which discrete spots appear along with diffraction rings.
The discrete diffraction spots reveal that the large crystallite is a
single-crystal ZnO. The ring pattern matches very well with the
SnO2 200 plane, indicating that the ring is attributed to the SnO2
nanocrystals next to the large crystallites.
In order to further understand lattice parameters of the ZnO
films, a list of the crystal planes identified by SAED is given in
Table III. The d-spacing measurement error d of the undoped
ZnO films is 0.010 Å based on the ZnO JCPDS data, and the aver-
age d-spacing normalized deviation Sˆd values of the TZOOAc and
TZOCl films are all larger than the uncertainty deviation of 
2,
which provides a strong evidence that the interplanar spacing of the
doped films has been changed by the addition of Sn dopant. This can
be understood by considering the ionic radii of Zn2+ r = 74 pm
and Sn2+ r = 122 pm. The increased lattice parameters of
TZOOAc and TZOCl films could be attributed to the incorporation
of Sn ions into the ZnO lattice. It is believed that when the Sn
dopant was introduced into the ZnO films, some of the Sn ions
occupied the Zn2+ sites or interstitial sites, and beyond the solubility
limit Sn ions may precipitate to form a new SnO2 phase in the films.
The estimated value of the lattice constant along the c axis is also
given in Table III. Similar to the in-plane lattice parameters, the c
axis constant increases from 5.196 Å for the undoped ZnO to 5.260
and 5.304 Å for the TZOOAc and TZOCl films, respectively.
It seems that the SAED results conflict with the XRD data in
which the TZO films show a slight shift in the diffraction angles of
XRD but are within the measurement error and can be ignored. This
discrepancy can be understood by looking at the specimen condi-
tions for the SAED and XRD experiments. The specimens for XRD
measurement have the TZO films on glass substrate, of which the
films are typically under constraint with residual stress in the
films.21 In contrast, the substrate of the specimens for SAED study
have to be removed by grinding, polishing, and ion milling, so that
the film thickness under electron beam is generally less than 100 nm
and in a nearly freestanding state.22 In other words, the residual
stress in the TZO films for TEM examination are usually relaxed;
thus, the SAED data could reflect the real lattice parameters of the
TZO films with Sn dopant, which are larger than those of the un-
doped ZnO.
Electrical and optical properties.— The sheet resistance Rs of
the ZnO films was measured by a four-terminal method and the
electrical resistivity was calculated by  = Rst t is the thickness of
the film. It was found that the electrical resistivity of undoped
ZnOOAc and ZnOCl films is high   2.0  104  cm, whereas
the electrical resistivity of the Sn-doped ZnO films is reduced con-
siderably. The TZOCl and ZnOOAc films exhibit an electrical re-
sistivity of 2.0  102 and 1.5  101  cm, respectively. The un-
doped ZnO films having composition close to stoichiometry have
high resistivity. In the Sn-doped ZnO films, the lower resistivity is
believed to come from the stoichiometric deviation, resulting in
higher free carrier concentration, thus reducing the film’s resistivity.
It is known that the electrical resistivity of a film depends on the
surface morphology. As discussed above, the TZOOAc film consists
of ZnO crystallites with uniform particle size 20 nm and has a
smooth surface, whereas the TZOCl film is composed of a mixture
