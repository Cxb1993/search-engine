Based on the above analysis, we have 
designed a passive dual-mode bandpass filter. 
The filter is built on 0.508-mm R04003C 
substrate with a dielectric constant of 3.55 and 
a loss tangent of 0.0021. A full-wave 
electromagnetic simulator IE3D is used to take 
all discontinuity effects into consideration. The 
measurement is carried out by Agilent E8362B. 
It should be noted that all the circuits built in 
this project are built/full-wave simulated/ 
measured based on the above substrate/ 
software/facility. The schematic diagram is 
shown in Figure 3
To change the input impedance of the filters 
dramatically, diodes are connected to where 
the current is small so that the passband of the 
filters can be switched on/off by diodes. When 
diodes are turned on, the small current is 
forced to be high current. The current 
distributions are not the same between the two 
filters with and without diodes, and neither are 
the frequency responses. 
. The filter dimensions are: 
L1 = 49.1 mm, L2 = 8.8 mm, W = 4 mm, W2 = 
8.8mm, and C = 4 pF. The center frequency is 
at 0.9 GHz, the fractional bandwidth is 12 %, 
and the circuit size is 0.062λg2. It should be 
noted that a rectangular patch at the symmetric 
plane is employed as a capacitive perturbation. 
There are also a DC supply, a resistor R= 1kΩ, 
and two shunt and short-circuited p-i-n diodes. 
All of these are for the switching purpose. The 
two diodes are skyworks SMP1321-079LF 
p-i-n diodes. The diode has a low capacitance 
of 0.25 pF, a parasitic inductance of 0.7 nH, 
and a low resistance of 3 ohm (forward current 
= 1 mA, frequency = 100 MHz). 
Figure 4 illustrates 
the frequency responses of the conventional 
ring filter with diode from A to D. As the diode 
is loaded at point B, the insertion loss can be 
suppressed under 15 dB, but the rest cannot. To 
achieve over 20-dB suppression of the 
insertion loss, two diodes are loaded at B and 
B’ respectively. Figure 5
The thing is to replace the quarter-wave 
microstrip line with a trident microstrip line. 
The trident lines act as the quarter-wave lines 
doing in the passband, and act like multiple 
bandstop filters in the stopband range. The 
transmission line model of the trident line is 
shown in 
 shows the simulated 
and measured results of the uniform-ring 
dual-mode bandpass filter. When the filter is 
turned on, the return loss is better than 12 dB 
and minimum insertion loss is 1.2 dB. As the 
filter is turned off, the insertion loss is 24 dB. 
Therefore, an over 22-dB on-off ratio is 
obtained. Thought the switching ability is 
achieved, however, the dual-mode bandpass 
filter suffers from the spurious passband. To 
overcome this problem, we proposed a 
modified dual-mode bandpass filter. 
Figure 6. The equivalent trident 
transmission-line model comprises two 
identical series transmission lines in the middle 
response. The upper path and the lower path 
are identical, and L2 is of half wavelength. 
Therefore, when the lower diode is on and the 
upper diode is off, the open circuit at point A 
transfers to an open circuit at point B, and the 
upper path is negligible, and vice versa. To 
turn off the filter, the DC voltage is zero volt. 
The two diodes are all off, and there is no 
signal passing to the output port. The bias 
network includes three resistors and one 
capacitor. The DC-blocking capacitance C1 is 
of 680 pF. The three resistance are R1 = R2 = R3 
= 1k ohm. The third resistor for DC return path 
is placed at the midpoint of the open-loop 
resonator to minimize the loading effect of the 
resistor since there is a virtual short at the 
midpoint at center frequency. 
To validate the design concept, a prototype 
filter is fabricated and tested. The filter is built 
on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate. The 
parameters are: D1 = 6.9 mm, G1 = 0.5 mm, G2 
= 3 mm, W1 = 0.6 mm, L1 = 101 mm, and L2 = 
93 mm. The parameters are optimized by a 
full-wave simulator IE3D. It should be noted 
that, ideally, L1 and L2 should be both equal to 
half wavelength. But, the parasitic effect of the 
diodes is included in simulation to precisely 
predict the filter response. Therefore, L1 and L2 
are different. Figure 11
 
 shows the simulated 
and measured results. The simulated results 
agree well with the measured results. For the 
Chebyshev response, from 0.88 GHz to 0.94 
GHz, the return loss is greater than 10 dB, and 
the insertion loss is less than 3 dB. For the 
quasi-elliptic-function response, while main- 
taining a similar passband response to that of 
Chebyshev one, in the stopband, two additional 
transmission zeros are at 0.79 GHz and 1.08 
GHz to improve cut-off response. For the 
OFF-state response, the insertion loss is greater 
than 44.2 dB, and the switchable filter has an 
on-off ratio of 41.2 dB.

Reconfigurable BPF with Tunable 
Bandwidth 
Figure 12
To validate the design concept, a prototype 
filter is fabricated and tested. The filter is built 
on a 0.508-mm RO4003C substrate. After the 
initial design and taking all the discontinuities 
and diode parasitics into account, the final 
filter dimension is: open loop length = 109 mm, 
open loop width = 2 mm, coupled line length = 
31.8 mm, coupled line width = 0.2 mm, and 
coupled line gap = 0.15 mm. 
 shows the schematic diagram of 
the reconfigurable bandpass filter with tunable 
bandwidth. It mainly consists of two 
quarter-wave coupled lines and a 
reconfigurable resonator. By turning the diode 
on or off, the open loop resonator will be 
connected or disconnected to the uniform 
half-wave resonator. Again, the diode used in 
this circuit is a skyworks SMP1345-079LF 
p-i-n diode. The biasing resistors are of 1k 
ohm. When the diode is reverse biased, the 
open loop is disconnected, and the bandpass 
has one pole for a narrow bandwidth. On the 
other hand, as the diode is forward biased, the 
open loop is loaded to the uniform half-wave 
resonator at its center, and the bandpass filter 
becomes a 3-pole bandpass filter for a wider 
bandwidth. This mode changing phenomena 
could be verified by using even- and odd-mode 
analysis technique as the circuit is symmetrical. 
Since there are couples of dimensions can be 
tuned, the bandwidth ratio is variable.  
Figure 13 shows 
the final results. The narrow-band response 
exhibits a return loss of better than 10 dB and a 
minimum insertion loss of 0.9 dB from 1.3
