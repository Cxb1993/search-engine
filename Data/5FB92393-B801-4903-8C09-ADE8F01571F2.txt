improvement of compressive plastic strain and reaches up to 24% occurs at the Mg-base
BMGC with 40 vol% Ti particles. The ductile Fe, porous Mo and Ti particles all provide a
good toughening effect in promoting the practical use of amorphous materials.
Introduction
Mg-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) were firstly discovered in the 1990s [1], are of
interest because of their low densities as compared to most other amorphous alloys, such as
the Pd-, Zr-, and Fe-based amorphous alloys [1-3]. However, the monolithic Mg-based BMGs
have been found to be the most brittle among all BMGs; they tend to break into pieces before
yielding [4-7]. To amend the weakness, Zhang et al. [8] predicted that the compositions of
monolithic Mg-based BMGs by using the high μ/B ratio concept. However, the resulting
BMGs do not display the manifestly ductility like Pt-and Zr-based BMGs. Therefore, many
efforts have devoted to develop Mg-based bulk metallic glasses composites (BMGCs) to
increase the plasticity of Mg-based BMGs. These include in-situ precipitated, ductile metal
and, refractory ceramic particles reinforced Mg-based BMGCs, which possess improved
compressive strengths and demonstrates the remarkable plastic strains [2, 9-13].
More recently, many investigations have proposed that the compressive ductility of
BMGs will be improved significantly by dividing the amorphous matrix of BMGs into
compartments on micrometer-scale [14-15]. The small regions limit the propensity of forming
mature shear bands. In fact, each stand-alone compartment can undergo great deformation
without failure, as reported in the previous studies [8, 16-19]. In Mg-based amorphous alloys,
the first development of Mg-based BMGC, Mg65Cu7.5Ni7.5Zn5Ag5Y10 with Fe dispersoid,
was reported by Ma et al. in 2003 [20]. Then, many other types Mg-based BMGCs have been
developed with ceramic and metallic particles (e.g., TiB2 [21], ZrO2[22],WC [23], SiC [24],
and Nb [25], porous Mo [26], Ti [27], and Fe [28]) and all exhibits remarkable plasticity
improvement. Among these developed Mg-based BMGCs, the Mg65Cu25Gd10/40vol%Ti
BMGC displays the highest plastic strain of 41% [26]. However, this BMGC presents much
low value of yield strength (470 MPa) than the base BMG (850 MPa). This differs from the
phenomena of the Mg58Cu28.5Gd11Ag2.5/25vol% porous Mo BMGC, possessing much
higher yield strength than the base BMG [25]. Therefore, we believe that there exist some
factors which may significantly affect the mechanical performance of these Mg-based BMGC,
including particle size, vol. fraction, and interface between the particle and the glassy matrix.
with the height (h) to diameter (d) ratio of 2:1 (h = 8 mm versus d = 4 mm, or h = 4 mm
versus d = 2 mm, respectively) were cut in parallel and carefully polished to insure the end
flatness. Multiple compression tests were conducted for confirming the reproducible trend and
the scattering of the stress and strain was less than ± 5% (i.e., less than ± 50 MPa for
engineering stresses and less than ± 0.5% for engineering strains, respectively). The
distribution of the porous Mo particles in the amorphous matrix and the morphology of
fracture surface were examined by a Hitachi S-4700 field-emission scanning electron
microscope (FEG-SEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) capability. The
microstructure of the interface between the porous Mo particle and the matrix was examined
by transmission electron microscopy (Philip Tecnai G2 TEM) operated at 200 kV.
Result and Discussion
1. Enhanced ductility of Mg based metallic glass with porous Mo particles
The XRD patterns of the BMGC rods 6 mm in diameter demonstrate the amorphous
matrix phase with the broadened and diffused humps. No apparent crystalline peak is detected
except the high intensity crystalline peaks from the Mo particles, as shown in Fig. 3. This
implies that the addition of Mo particles did not affect the matrix composition and no obvious
chemical reaction has occurred to deteriorate the GFA. The SEM micrograph of the polished
cross-sectional surface of the BMGC containing 20 vol % porous Mo particles is shown in
Fig. 4. The inserted XRD pattern demonstrates that the diffuse hump originated from the
amorphous matrix superimposed with the crystalline peaks from the Mo particles. Differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC)results of the BMGC reveal the similar glass and crystallization
response as the matrix glass. There seems to be no obvious chemical reaction taken place at
the interface and thus no effect to lower the glass forming ability. Figure 4(a) shows that the
Mo particles, in the range of 20–70 m in size or an average of 50 μm, are dispersed
homogeneously in the metallic glassy matrix. oreover, the interspaces between and within
the porous Mo particles are filled completely with the Mg-based BMG, as shown in Fig. 4(b),
indicating that the Mg-based metal liquid has been infiltrated into the interspaces of Mo
porous particles under the pressure and stirring of solidification process. The overall
microstructure of the current BMGC is separated into larger-scale compartment (in the scale
of ~50 μm among the many Mo particles) and the fine-scale compartment (in the scale of
1–5μm within one porous Mo particle).
the interspaces of Mo particles during induction melting. There are few incidents that
incomplete infiltration occurs, as shown an example in Fig. 8, leaving a small amount of pores
less than 10 μm. It is noticed that the pore amount is a strong function of the cooling rate
(combining the effect from both the rod diameter and the Cu mold temperature), as presented
in Fig. 9. There is more than five times difference in the resulting pore volume fraction in the
current study range. The residual porosity is seen to play an important role in affecting the
mechanical performance of these Mg-based BMGCs. Fig. 10 shows the room temperature
compressive stress-strain curves of the Mg-based BMGC rods (Vf = 0 ~ 25%) for the 2 mm
sample fabricated by the cooling rate of 46K/s. After yielding point, all of BMGC samples
containing Mo dispersoids continuously deform to an appreciable plastic strain until failure.
The highest compressive failure deformation occurs for the BMGC rod with 25 vol% Mo
particles measuring 2 mm in diameter (~10 %). The 4 mm BMGC rods with 25 vol% Mo
particles show the same trend as the 2 mm ones but with a slightly lower plastic strain and
fracture strength, owing to the higher residual porosity which formed by the lower cooling
rate. The porosity may initiate the crack and result in decreased mechanical performance of
the BMGC during compression test. For further examination of the residual porosity effect on
the mechanical properties, the BMGC rods injection-cast by different cooling rates were
compression tested. The compressive stress-strain curves of the BMGC rods fabricated by the
different cooling rates are compared in Fig. 11. The higher Cu mold temperature, or the lower
cooling rate, will lead to the lower porosity, which in-turn result in a higher compression
ductility, yield strength, and fracture strength, as clearly shown in Fig. 12. The best
compressive performance occurs for the 25 vol% BMGC 2 mm rod cast at the 63 K/s cooling
rate, with about 14% compressive failure strain, 1050 MPa yield strength, and 1200 MPa
fracture strength. In addition, the fracture toughness (K1C, the stress concentration factor) for
these Mg-based BMGC rods measured by the indentation method [33] also show a similar
trend as the compression results: increasing K1C with increasing porous Mo volume fraction
shown in Fig. 13(a) and increasing K1C with decreasing residual porosity shown in Fig.
13(b).
The SEM observations on the fracture surface were conducted to evaluate the function of
the “ductile Mo particles” on the improvement of mechanical performance. The observations 
on the specimen surface near the fracture area (Fig. 14) indicate the deformation follows a
shear-band mechanism. Fig. 14(a) shows the fractured specimen with a fracture surface
oriented about 43 degree to the loading axis. The multiple shear bands can be observed along
the fracture surface and around the Mo particles as shown in Fig. 14(b), meaning that there

stress and strain is less than ± 5% or less than ± 50 MPa and ± 5% or around ± 0.5%
engineering strain, respectively. Though the performance of Fe contained Mg-based BMGC is
not as strong as the porous Mo contained Mg-based BMGC [34], with the plastic strain of
10% and the yield strength of 0.95 GPa, but it is similar to the 8 vol. % solid Nb-reinforced
Mg-based BMGC [35], with similar plastic strain and yield strength (~0.8 GPa) due to
employ the low-yield ductile metal (i.e. Fe and Nb). However, for considering the cost of
materials, the cheaper Fe particle (compare to Nb and Mo particle) is still have the potential to
apply on strengthening the Mg-based BMGs.
It is known that the monolithic Mg-based BMG matrix should have a high strength
(~0.85 GPa) if premature failure before reaching its elastic limit is avoided [36]. This
confirms that the combination of the Fe particles and Mg-based amorphous matrix maintains
the high strength from the amorphous matrix, and also brings very good plasticity from the
ductile particles. Therefore, the SEM observations on the fracture surface were performed to
evaluate the function of the “ductile Fe particles” on the improvement of mechanical 
performance. The observations on the specimen surface near the fracture area (Fig. 6) indicate
the deformation follows a shear-band mechanism. The fractured specimen with a fracture
surface oriented about 43 o to the loading axis is shown in Fig. 6(a). In Fig. 6(b), the multiple
shear bands can be observed along the fracture surface and around the Fe particles, indicating
that there exists a strong reaction between ductile Fe particle and shear banding from the
amorphous matrix.
For composite materials, there are two possible ways to toughen a brittle matrix: (i) by
crack bridging from the adding a soft second phase with a strong interface, or (ii) by crack
deflecting from the adding a strong hard phase with a weak interface. Compared with the
Mg-based BMGs, Fe particles can be regarded as hard phase because of its higher modulus
(211 GPa). It directly shows that the bifurcation of shear bands around the Fe particles have
been observed in the present study, as shown in the circle area of Fig. 6(b). On the other hand,
Fe particles still can be sheared-off plastically by the shear bands and absorbed large energy
of shear bands (as shown in Fig. 7), and so as to enhance plasticity. Nevertheless, a slightly
decreasing trend with increasing the addition of Fe particles was suggested due to the
formation of brittle intermetallic phase at the interface between the Fe particle and amorphous
matrix. A thin layer crystalline phase with thickness about 3 nm was found to attach on the
surface of Fe particle by TEM examination, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Though this crystalline
phase is too thin to be fully identified by the nano-beam diffraction, it is still can be presumed
by the phase diagram and EDS analysis, as shown in Fig. 8. There is no Fe constituent was

inherent low hardness of pure Ti (Hv 168) in comparison with the amorphous matrix (Hv
270). However, the hardness of these Mg-based composites is in agreement with the rule of
mixture of the particular-reinforced composite materials. On the other hand, the compression
tests revealed that a drastically improvement in plastic strain for the Ti particles reinforced
Mg based BMGCs. When the volume fraction of Ti particles increases to 30 vol%, the
Mg-based BMGC begins to exhibit clearly large enhancement of plasticity with true
compressive plastic strain up to 12 %, and a more remarkable increase in plastic strain up to
24% was obtained at the Mg based BMGC with 40 vol% Ti particles, as shown in Fig. 5. At
the same time, these BMGCs present small decrease in yield strength and keeps at the value
of 800 MPa. Multiple compression tests were conducted for confirming the reproducible trend
and the scattering of the stress and strain is less than ± 5% or less than ± 40 MPa and ± 5% or
around ± 0.5% engineering strain, respectively. In addition, it is worth to note that the BMGC
with above 20 vol% Ti particles presents distinct work hardening behavior after the yielding
due to the work hardening nature of Ti phase. The ultimate compressive strength up to 945
MPa can be obtained at 40 vol% sample. Though the performance of Ti contained Mg-based
BMGC is not as strong as the porous Mo contained Mg-based BMGC [34], with 10% plastic
strain and 0.95 GPa yield strength, but it performs much better plasticity than the 8 vol% solid
Nb particle-reinforced Mg-based BMGC (12 % plastic strain) [35] and exhibits much higher
yield strength than the 40 vol% Ti particle-reinforced Mg65Cu25Gd10 BMGC (about 470
MPa yield strength) [41]. Accordingly, the low density Ti particle (compare to Nb and Mo
particle) still has the strong potential to apply on strengthening the Mg-based BMGs for the
consideration of materials density.
In order to clarify the mechanism of significant plasticity enhancement in Mg-based
BMGC, the SEM observations on the fracture surface were conducted to evaluate the function
of the “ductile Ti particles” on the improvement of mechanical performance. The observations 
on the specimen surface near the fracture area (Fig. 6) indicate the deformation follows a
shear-band mechanism. Fig. 6(a) shows the fractured specimen with a fracture surface
oriented about 45 degree to the loading axis. The multiple shear bands can be observed along
the fracture surface and around the Ti particles as shown in Fig. 6(b), meaning that there
exists a strong reaction between ductile Ti particle and shear banding from the amorphous
matrix. It directly shows that the bifurcation of shear bands around the Ti particles have been
observed in the fractured Mg-based BMGC/40 vol% Ti particles specimen with 24 % plastic
strain after compression test, lots of stress concentration was released by the plastic
deformation of ductile Ti particles. On the other hand, the fracture surface of the Mg-based
