HCPV system＇s output power. In addition, the 
instability phenomenon of the photovoltaic＇s DC 
power output will cause wrong estimation of the power 
converter＇s (such as inverter) tracking algorithm 
and decrease the efficiency. The vibration phenomenon 
is usually rapid； however it will cause instability 
of power for a longer period. In addition, it will 
result in huge power and efficiency loses. If 
regulator circuit or components can be integrated 
into HCPV system 
to regulate the voltage of photovoltaic receivers＇ 
output, it will improve HCPV system＇s stability and 
power generation. This research will analyze and 
simulate the effect of integrating super-capacitor 
circuit to HCPV system. The circuit model and 
simulation parameters of the proposed system will be 
built and investigated in the first step. Then we 
will investigate the process of integrating super-
capacitor into HCPV＇s receiver. After that, we will 
take experiments to analyze and compare the power 
output stability of the proposed system with 
conventional system＇s. It can improve the efficiency 
and increase the power generation of High 
Concentration Photovoltaic System via the 
implementation of this project. In addition, the 
process of integrating super-capacitor to 
HCPV system can be developed via this project. 
Moreover, this project proposes a novel application 
of the super-capacitor with photovoltaic system.

本計畫「整合超級電容於高聚光型太陽能系統以提高發電穩定度之研究」，旨在研製能有效提升
高聚光型太陽能系統(High Concentration Photovoltaic, HCPV)發電穩定度之輔助電路元件系統。HCPV
系統結構上需搭配追日系統，而追日系統容易因風力或太陽光感測器受干擾造成振動；而HCPV系統
由於只接受直射日照太陽光，因此發電量很容易受到振動造成追日系統角度偏移而急速下降，此不穩
現象會造成後端電力轉換裝置(如變流器,inverter)的控制演算法誤判而影響電力輸出。然而此振動的影
響通常是短暫瞬間的，卻會造成較長時間的發電量不穩，間接造成較高的HCPV系統的發電量及效能
下降比例。本計畫研究以超級電容整合於HCPV模組，來評估其改善HCPV系統因振動而引起的發電
量不穩現象的效益。

本計畫之主要目的在於設計並實現以下三項主軸：(1)整合超級電容於HCPV系統之電路模擬及效

本計畫著重於分析整合超級電容於HCPV系統之電路模擬及效應，並研究HCPV接收器及超級電

(三) 文獻探討                                                               
整合超級電容於 HCPV 系統研究之背景 
  近年來，隨著再生能源及太陽能發電的蓬勃發展，對於具有低發電成本的高聚光型太陽能系統
(HCPV)的需求快速增加。HCPV 系統的相關研製，也受到許多國內外專家、學者、廠商的關切與投
入。研究方法著重於多介面三五族太陽電池製程、模組的設計、發電廠的發電統計等[1-14]；在超級
電容的應用研究方面，有電路模擬模型、電池結合超級電容以改進效能、整合超級電容至再生能源儲
能系統等[15-22]。然而，整合超級電容於 HCPV 系統的相關研究，國內外尚無相關之文獻發表。 
改善 HCPV 發電量穩定度方法的選擇 
在改善 HCPV 系統因外在環境的瞬間改變而造成發電量不穩的研究方面，以加強模組及追日系
統結構[1, 8, 9, 23, 24]等研究改善方式居多，此外亦有以改良最大功率追蹤(MPPT)演算法[25, 26]、改
善太陽光感測器[6]、以及改善模組及接收器製造公差[27]等方式。然而這些方式對於發電量不穩的改
善皆有限，從成本及耗電量的角度來看，增加硬體精度會增加極大的製造成本，從機構來減振也具有
造成更大的鋼鐵成本以及更多的追日耗電量的缺點。而且隨著 HCPV 系統的大型化趨勢，如 Amonix
公司所開發的大型 HCPV 系統，其所需要的硬體成本將更大，且設計上更困難[1, 10]。因此若能在接
收器的製造過程中，就將穩壓電路元件整合進模組，將不受建置系統大小的影響，並能有效降低目前
改善方法的成本和設計困難。 
超級電容和太陽能系統結合之文獻回顧 
以超級電容與太陽能系統的結合方面，有研究學者以超級電容來取代蓄電池儲能系統而應用在太
陽能發電系統中，並具備最大功率追蹤功能[28]。另一方面，許多研究證實了超級電容的高效率、高
電流容量等優點，在結合蓄電池以應用於再生能源儲能系統時，可有效改進整體的效能[15, 16, 
18-22]。然而將超級電容整合到太陽能接收器，尤其是 HCPV 太陽能接收器中，綜觀國內外尚無類似

發電穩定度改善效應評估： 
本計畫主要以不同的偏移角、超級電容容量、晃動持續時間來找出最佳電容值，並討論超級電容
對整體的 HCPV 系統效率提升輔助以及無超級電容的 HCPV 系統做比較。一般 HCPV 系統可容許角
約為 1°以內，且根據量測數據分析，當系統追日或因強風晃動造成的偏移角大部分在 1°的範圍內，
此 1°的角度偏移會造成約 50%的電力下降。本研究以每 3 秒發生一次震動，每次震動持續時間為 0.1
秒之條件進行模擬及實測。

超級電容的負載端輸出從 2.7V 瞬間降為 1.3V，証明系統只要有晃動時會造成輸出端的電壓值大大下

結合超級電容之 HCPV 模組發電穩定度實測： 
本計畫將超級電容整合完成之 HCPV 模組和未整合超級電容之模組，進行實際戶外測試並評估
其效應。由於最大功率點之 Vmp (最大功率電壓)之量測需以 I-V tester 量測整個 I-V 曲線後取得最大
點，然而整個量測過程所需時間過長，不符本研究針對追日系統振動所需之快速反應測試，因此先以

結論與討論： 
本計畫之實測結果顯示超級電容對於 HCPV 系統的效率提升是有幫助，由負載實驗發現超級電容
5F 在偏移角度θ=1°、2°、3°時，其負載端輸出電壓可維持原輸出電壓之 93.2%、89.8%、及 85.2%。
而 SPICE 模擬結果顯示，在實際實測較難精確量到之 0.1°~0.4°角度偏移時，模組輸出電壓下降約在
6.25%以內。 
因此超級電容對於HCPV效能的提升改善確實有不錯的效果，在短時間的偏移、不同的偏移角θ，
超級電容都可以使系統負載端發電量維持在容許範圍內。然而在超級電容的電荷量不足而持續未對其
充電(如長時間偏移誤差)下，將喪失其穏壓功能，研究結果顯示不同偏移角度所需搭配的超級電容值
亦不同。雖然越大超級電容值其可涵蓋之偏移角度越大，但是仍需評估成本、空間、重量等因素來決
定其最佳之電容量。 
本計畫已證實其提出之技術，可有效地改進高聚光型太陽能系統的效能及發電穩定度；並已藉由
本計畫之執行完成，產出具參考價值之相關模擬模型和實驗數據，相關成果有助於國家發展低成本之
再生能源系統之參考。而整合超級電容於高聚光型太陽能系統之研究，綜觀國內外尚無類似之文獻發
表，因此本計畫之相關成果具有創新研究之參考價值。

Evaluation of the Stability Improvement in Power Generation of a Concentration Photovoltaic 
Module with Supercapacitors

ABSTRACT 
 
The pointing accuracy of a tracking system in concentration 
photovoltaic (CPV) varies over a range of error values. Among 
the external disturbances that can degrade the accuracy of 
trackers include temperature changes, wind loading, low direct 
normal irradiation conditions and soiling of sensors, ultimately 
leading to unstable output power of a CPV system. A 
supercapacitor has a higher power density than that of battery, 
allowing the supercapacitor to provide more power over a short 
period of time. This study examines the feasibility of using 
supercapacitors to improve the stability of power generation in 
CPV systems. Supercapacitors are incorporated into the CPV 
module circuit. The equivalent circuit of a single solar cell with a 
supercapacitor is then constructed and simulated for 
determining the optimized capacitance of the supercapacitors. 
Simulation results indicate that a module circuit with 10F 
supercapacitor can significantly increase the stability of the 
output voltage waveform under the condition of a tracking error 
around 0.3°. Moreover, the output voltage decreases only 
around 4%, with the tracking error around 0.3°. Capacitance of 
the used supercapacitors, which should be adjusted based on 
various conditions, is an important design parameter that alters 
the efficiency and cost of a CPV system. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Rising fossil fuel prices and environmental pollution globally 
have led to a heavy emphasis on renewable energy sources. 
Solar energy represents a renewable energy resource of 
growing importance. Of the many factors influencing the output 
of a concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) system, tracking accuracy 
is of priority concern, especially in high concentration systems. 
 
Actual pointing accuracy of tracking systems varies over a range 
of error values. Among the external disturbances that can affect 
tracker accuracy include temperature changes, wind loading, 
low direct normal irradiation (DNI) conditions and soiling of 
sensors, especially for purely closed-loop tracking systems with 
a sun sensor [1]. For open loop tracking, among the long term 
changes that can induce constant tracking errors include ground 
movement or mechanical and electrical degradation of the CPV 
system. Such tracking errors introduce uncertainty of the output 
of CPV modules, even shutting down the power condition circuit 
(i.e. inverter) under worst case scenario. According to Fig 1,

Figure 3 Photovoltaic cell model. 
 
Figure 4 Supercapacitor equivalent circuit model. 
 
Figure 4 illustrates demonstrates the classical equivalent circuit 
model for the supercapacitor[5]. The model consists of three 
components: capacitance, equivalent series resistance (ESR), 
and equivalent parallel resistance (EPR). As a loss term that 
models the internal heating in a capacitor, ESR is the most 
important component during charging and discharging. EPR 
models the current leakage effect and impacts the long term 
energy storage performance of a supercapacitor: and C is the 
capacitance. The model is verified with an ELNA 3V/50F 
supercapacitor with an ESR of 80mΩ and an EPR of 258Ω. Here, 
the simulation of the circuit is conducted by Orcad PSpice Ver.

RESULT 
 
Figure 5 shows typical sample raw data of tracking error 
measured by the Trac-Stat SL1. The data is collected under a 
clear sky with an occasional cloud cover. According to the data, 
pointing error of the tracker ranges from 0 to 0.6° with an 
average of around 0.3°. The acceptance angle of the CPV 
module is around 0.5°. Therefore, during the first step, the 
proposed circuits with and without supercapacitors are 
simulated with a tracking error of 0.5°. Figure 6 summarizes the 
simulation results of CPV cell photocurrent source Iph and load 
voltage Vload with/without supercapacitor. The cell photocurrent 
source Iph (around 1A at 850W/m2) is turned on and turned off 
periodically, representing a situation in which the tracking error 
of the tracker is 0° and 0.5° separately. The frequency of the 
simulation waveform is 1 Hz with turn off duration around 100ms. 
The voltage waveform of the load remains stable with 50F 
supercapacitor, even when the cell photocurrent source 
periodically turns on and off. 
 
Figure 7 summarizes the simulation result of the proposed 
circuit with different supercapacitors. The cell photocurrent 
source Iph is fluctuated between 1A and 0.4A periodically, 
representing a situation which the tracking error of the tracker is 
0° and 0.3°separately. The voltage waveform of the load 
remains stable with a 50F or 10F supercapacitor. However the 
Vload waveform of the circuit with 50F supercapacitor is more 
stable than the circuit with 10F supercapacitor. When the 
supercapacitor value lower than 0.1F, the Vload value drops from 
2.7V (100%) to 1.8V (67%, 0.3°tracking error). Under the same 
condition, Vload decreases only around 4% (from 2.7V to 2.6V) 
with a 10F supercapacitor.

7.3: Flight Performance and Environmental Effects - 
Scott Messenger (NRL) and Bao Hoang (Loral)
Advances in photovoltaic device performance for 
spacecraft applications over the past decade have 
been continuous and remarkable. However, spacecraft 
requirements of the power system continue to grow 
and power subsystems are still the most failure prone, 
thus there is much work to be done. Papers describe 
advancements in photovoltaic devices capable of high 
performance (efficiency, mass specific power, volumetric 
specific power, radiation stability, high temperature 
capability, LILT, low-cost, etc) as well as solar array 
designs suitable for these advanced devices. Also 
included are papers concerning cell, array and power 
system reliability, space environmental effects, and 
advanced protective materials for the space environment. 
To span the spectrum from fundamental research to 
applied engineering, we welcomed papers ranging 
fromtheoretical studies to applied experimental efforts, 
including characterization and qualification as well as 
flight experiments and missions.
Area 7 has been divided into three sub-areas, as presented 
below. Submission of papers on detailed scientific 
research studies and visionary papers addressing the 
full range of these fundamental issues and technological 
challenges in the field are invited, including:
Sub-area 7.1: Space Devices and Materials
This sub-area focuses on novel photovoltaic device 
approaches and recent developments for achieving 
high performance photovoltaic devices for spacecraft 
applications. Submissions included next generation 
multijunction solar cells, quantum enhanced devices, 
advanced cell materials and the spin-on of terrestrial 
photovoltaics for spacecraft applications (ie. thin film 
PV, etc). In addition, novel environmental protection 
technologies that enable longer on-orbit capability, 
high voltage operation, etc., were sought. We invited 
submission of papers on characterization, modeling, and

Sub-Areas & Chairs
8.1: Defects in Photovoltaic 
Materials and Solar Cells
8.2: Advanced Methods and 
Instruments for the Characterization of Solar Cells and 
Modules
8.3: Characterization Methods for the Photovoltaic 
Industry: In-Situ Measurements, Process Control, Defect 
Monitoring
8.4: Challenges in the Characterization of Multijunction 
PV Devices
8.5: Performance, Reliability Testing, and Standards
It is difficult to understand innovation in photovoltaics 
without the support of measurements and characterization. 
Measurements are needed at all different levels of R&D, 
from the investigation of the operating principles of 
solar cells to standards for the performance of installed 
PV systems. Understanding the relations between 
structure, physical properties, and the resulting PV 
performance is an exemplary problem in materials 
science and engineering and, in our opinion, one of the 
most critical to the development of the next generation of 
PV. Area 8 is intended for the presentation of the latest 
developments in the characterization of photovoltaics. 
We encouraged members of the PV community to submit 
their contributions addressing the full range of scientific 
and technological challenges in the field, including the 
following topics:
8.1: Defects in Photovoltaic Materials and Solar Cells
The presence of defects often limits the performance 
of solar cells and process yield. Relevant to this sub-
area are all methods for the characterization of defects 
and their influence on the PV performance, including 
(opto)electronic measurements, structure, composition, 
stress fields, and mechanical properties. This sub-area 
includes both intrinsic defects of the PV materials and 
manufacturing defects associated with yield.
8.2: Advanced Methods and Instruments for the 
Characterization of Solar Cells and Modules
In the last decade, improvements in methods and 
instrumentation in the field of the characterization of 
PV have been extraordinary. This sub-area is targeted 
to an audience that is interested in getting a better 
understanding of the most recent developments in 
characterization methods and the capabilities offered by
