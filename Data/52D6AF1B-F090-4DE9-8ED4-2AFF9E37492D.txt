Abstract  
In recent years, research attention has been 
devoted to the relative utility of different depth 
cues within the context of computer simulation. 
However, results frequently are complicated by 
the fact the relative cue utility is dependent on 
other interacting variables, e.g. light source, 
viewing distance, blurred shape, rotated angle, 
texture of shape, etc. For investigating the 
interactions among these variables, this 
research project adopts the experimental 
method to examine the effects of design factors 
and presentation characteristics of 3D shapes 
on depth perception or height judgment. Five 
experiments were conducted to examine the 
effects of design factors and presentation 
characteristics of three-dimensional shapes on 
depth perception.  
Experiment I, we investigated the effect of 
light-source color, size, background luminance, 
and blur on the perceived convexity and 
concavity of a 3D hemisphere. Participants 
were asked to adjust the angle of light in a 
clockwise direction until a convex hemisphere 
appeared concave. The results indicated that the 
color of light had a significant effect on the 
angle of adjusted light. The angle of the 
adjusted light was significantly smaller for high 
background luminance compared with the 
medium- and low-luminance conditions. The 
angle of adjusted light under the low-blur 
condition was greater than that under the high- 
and medium-blur conditions.  
Experiment II, the effects of light type, 
angle rotated forward of stimulus, and surface 
type on error in perceived distance were 
explored. Analyzes indicated that the angle 
rotated forward of stimulus had significant 
effect on error in perceived distance, indicating 
the angles rotated forward of stimulus 
increased, the error in perceived distance 
decreased. The stimulus surface type also 
significantly affected error in perceived 
distance. The error in perceived distance for 
surface type of translucent plastic was greater 
than those for wood, dark brown leather, and 
metal. However, no significant effect of light 
type on dependent variable was found.  
Experiment III, we investigated three 
factors involved in the evaluation of perceived 
in depth of a cylindrical hole within a cylinder 
presented on a LCD monitor: diameter of 
cylindrical hole, light type, and angle rotated 
forward of stimulus. Subjects were asked to 
perceive the depth of cylindrical hole within a 
stimulus cylinder. Analyzes indicated that the 
diameter of cylindrical hole had significant 
effect on error in perceived depth of cylindrical 
hole, indicating error in perceived depth were 
greater for diameter at 10 cm than at 16 cm and

3D digital visualization is the electronic 
display of image data in three dimensions. It 
has been used in a broad range of areas in the 
last few decades (Lee, 2009). It helps people 
understand and organize large, complex 
information effectively (Bustos et al., 2009). 
With the increasing use of 3D visualization 
technology, people come across 3D digital 
visualizations in both their private and 
professional lives in areas such as medicine, 
simulation and training, history and 
archaeology, engineering, and game playing 
(Gutieerez et al., 2008; LaViola, 2008). To 
examine various 3D visualization applications, 
search termssuch as 3D visualization and 
virtual reality were selected to ensure the 
identification of all relevant literature on 3D 
visualization (Lee, 2009). 
3D visualization not only offers animation 
and interactivity (Van der Kooij & te Pas, 2009), 
it also enables the consumer to rotate the 
product and study it virtually from all sides (de 
Boer, Verleur, Heuvelman, & Heynderickx, 
2010; Pile, 2003). The change from 2D to 3D 
representations offers a more detailed 
perception of the product (Van der Kooij & te 
Pas, 2009). Today, 3D visualization is the most 
popular mode for the simulation of products 
and services on the Internet (Ozok & Komlodi, 
2009). 
The 3D shape is perceptually unique in 
that it is the only visual property that is 
sufficiently complex to enable accurate 
identification of the object. When a 3D shape is 
properly defined, it is generally veridical (Pizlo, 
Sawada, Li, Kropatsch, & Steinman, 2010). 
Without depth perception, users are not able to 
effectively perceive the detail of the product 
online (Lee, Eastman, Taunk, & Ho, 2010), and 
3D shape perception is distorted because it is 
assumes depth perception (Pizlo et al., 2010). 
Thus, studying depth perception using a 3D 
shape will enhance accurate and effective 
online presentation of product details.  
It would be logical to hypothesize that 
most shopping activities for consumer products, 
customers are interested in touching and feeling 
the products before they buy them (Lightner, 
Yensisey, Ozok, & Salvendy, 2002). With the 
internet growing widespread, online consumer 
reviews have become an important resource for 
consumers seeking quality product (Adams, 
2007), however, in which customer can only 
see the products instead of touching them. 
Although business to consumer through 
Internet has been growing steadily in the last 
decade (Ozok & Komlodi, 2009), previous 2D 
visual representation provided a list of features 
and a simple sketch of the custom product is 
insufficient for the customer decisions based on 
aesthetic judgments (Segura, Arizkuren, 
Aranburu, & Telleria, 2005). The rapidly 
increasing development of 3D technologies 
results in inexorably progressing and has 
evolved enough to expand e-commerce into an 
interdisciplinary area (Berneburg, 2008). Today, 
sellers and designers can propose real 3D 
objects to replace simple online catalogs 
containing descriptions and pictures (Sanna & 
Montrucchio, 2002). Such 3D visual 
representation of product online provided an 
interactive effect which enable user to scan, 
recognize, and recall images rapidly, as well as 
to easily detect patterns and changes in size, 
  4 
depth under white and yellow light was 
significantly less than that under green light; 
the error in perceived depth under white light 
was significantly less than that under blue light, 
but not sensitive to white, yellow, and red light. 
Moreover, Kingdom et al. (2005, 2006) 
proposed the color-shading effect, which 
describes the phenomenon whereby a 
chromatic pattern influences the perceived 
“shape from shading” based on the luminance 
pattern. Kingdom et al. (2006) examined 
whether color contrast can influence perceived 
shape in patterns that combined “shape from 
shading” with “shape from texture.” Their 
results showed that color contrast had an 
impact on perceived depth in patterns that 
combined shape from shading with shape from 
texture; color contrast had no influence on 
perceived depth in the absence of shading. 
Guibal and Dresp (2004) suggested that 
luminance and color are strong and 
self-sufficient cues to pictorial depth in visual 
scenes and images. Their results showed that 
the luminance contrast of a red color, when it 
does not interact with other colors, produces 
the same effect as achromatic luminance 
contrast and that red color contrast on a light 
background supported by any of the three 
geometric cues is superior to green or white 
color contrast supported by any of the three 
geometric cues.  
An important factor determining human 
perception of depth is the level of blur 
(Gerardin, de Montalembert, & Mamassian, 
2007; Phillips, Thompson, & Voshell, 2004) or 
the spatial frequency of the stimulus (Awasthi, 
Friedman, & Williams, 2011; Goffaux & 
Rossion, 2006; Lee, Shioiri, & Yaguchi, 2007). 
Gerardin, et al. (2007) used low-pass filters 
with different cutoff frequencies to generate 
different levels of blur in stimuli to test a 
preference for globally convex shapes. The 
results showed a preference for globally convex 
shapes, particularly when the stimulus was 
severely blurred. Phillips, et al. (2004) 
investigated the effect of subject matter 
(portraits, ecological scenes, and artificial 
objects), viewing distance (the stimuli 
subtended approximately 6 to 60 degrees), and 
mark resolution (4 to 81 marks placed 
horizontally across the widest part of the object) 
on the perception of 2D or 3D stimuli. The 
authors found a significant interaction between 
size and marking frequency. Their results 
support Pelli’s findings (1999) that image size 
in the visual field and relative size of the marks 
used to depict the object interact in object 
perception. This phenomenon is supported by 
masking studies that examined the effects of 
spatial frequency on image perception (Sergent, 
1986; Goffaux & Rossion, 2006; Goffaux, 
Gauthier, & Rossion, 2003; Lee et al., 2007). 
Different visual-spatial frequency information 
may be used to extract featural and configural 
information within an image. Sergent (1986) 
argued that high spatial frequency reflects local 
luminance gradients, whereas low spatial 
frequency reflects large-scale changes. 
Low-spatial-frequency information is extracted 
and processed rapidly (Morrison & Schyns, 
2001; Schyns & Oliva, 1999), and it may be 
particularly important for rapid recognition of 
images (Goffaux et al., 2003). In contrast, 
feature-based processing is largely dependent 
on high-spatial-frequency information (Awasthi, 
Friedman, & Williams, 2011). Similarly, 
Goffaux and Rossion (2006) suggested that

Stimulus Materials and Design 
The present experiment investigated four 
independent variables: light color, blur, 
background luminance, and hemisphere size. 
Four hemispheric diffuse colored lights (white, 
red, green, and blue) were used. The 
Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) 
coordinate values [L (cd/m2), x, y] for the 
colors used in the present study were white: 
192.1, 0.331, 0.330; red: 55.9, 0621, 0.328; 
green: 174.2, 0.444, 0.479; and blue: 74.6, 
0.191, 0.229. Low-pass filters with different 
frequencies were applied to the stimuli to find 
three levels of blur (Gerardin et al., 2007). We 
used Gaussian filters with a standard deviation 
chosen along a logarithmic scale: 0.00 (low 
blur; a normal image), 8.00 (medium blur), and 
16.00 pixels (high blur; Fig. 1). Background 
luminance was 255 (high), 185 (medium), and 
115 cd/m2 (low). The stimuli were presented at 
two sizes: large (1222 × 854 pixels) and small 
(611 × 427 pixels). These four variables were 
within-subject variables. Thus, 72 stimuli (four 
colored lights × three background luminances × 
three levels of blur × two sizes) were randomly 
presented to the participants. 
The stimuli were produced using a visual 
simulator designed using Rhinoceros 4.0 
(McNeel North America, Seattle, WA, USA) 
and Adobe flash CS4 and were displayed in the 
center of a View Sonic 19-in color monitor 
using Pentium M PC-based Microsoft software. 
The screen resolution was 1280 × 1024 with a 
refresh rate of 75 Hz. The monitor was placed 
on a table 78 cm in height, and the display was 
tilted to 105°. A head-and-chin rest was used to 
maintain a constant viewing distance of 50 cm. 
The test stimulus consisted of a gray 
hemisphere on a gray background (Figure 1). 
The direction of light from directly overhead 
was defined as 0 degrees, and the direction of 
light from directly below was defined as 180 
degrees. Examples of light direction are shown 
in Figure 2. We used 19 light directions from 0 
to 180 degrees, in increments of 10 degrees. A 
stimulus was a hemisphere that was illuminated 
by each color of light was presented under the 
various experimental conditions, and the 
participants were asked to identify the stimulus 
as convex or concave.

These findings indicate two two-way 
interaction effects. The first is a significant 
interaction between subject group and blur 
(F2,162 = 3.13, p = .04, partial η2 = 0.06) on the 
angle of adjusted light. This interaction is 
illustrated in Figure 3, which shows that the 
adjusted angle of light for participants who had 
experience using 3D software was larger than 
that for participants who had no experience 
using 3D software. The simple effect of blur 
(low vs. medium vs. high) on angle of adjusted 
light was significant for participants who had 
experience using 3D software (128.87 vs. 
147.80 vs. 122.82, respectively; F2, 80 = 8.45, p 
< .001, partial η2 = 0.17); however, this effect 
was not significant for participants who had no 
experience using 3D software (145.21 vs. 
143.05 vs. 143.63, respectively; F2, 80 = 8.45, p 
= .09, partial η2 = 0.06).

The second significant interaction was 
between background luminance and blur on the 
angle of adjusted light (F4, 324 = 3.91, p < .01, 
partial η2 = 0.05). Figure 4 shows the mean 
angle of adjusted light versus background 
luminance over the range of blur. Background 
luminance had a significant effect under the 
medium- and high-blur conditions, but little 
effect under the low-blur condition. The simple 
effect of background luminance (high vs. 
medium vs. low) on angle of adjusted light was 
significant for blur under the medium-blur 
condition (132.91 vs. 132.53 vs. 135.47, 
respectively; F2, 162 = 3.36, p = .04, partial η2 = 
0.05) and under the high-blur condition (129.95

displayed in the center of a View Sonic 19-in 
color monitor by Pentium M PC based 
Microsoft software. The resolution of screen 
was 1280 × 1024 at 75Hz of refresh rate. It was 
placed on a table of 78.5 cm in height and the 
inclination of the display was 105°. A head and 
chin rest was used to control the constant 
viewing distance of 50 cm. 
 The stimuli used were replicas of a 3-D 
cube. Each cube was 20.0 cm wide, 20.0 cm 
long, and 2.0 cm high. An ellipsoidal hole was 
designed in the middle of each stimulus. The 
horizontal distance of ellipsoidal hole was 
longer than its vertical distance. When the 
stimulus was presented on the horizontal plane 
or was only rotated forward with a small angle 
by the front plane, participants might not be 
able to see the whole ellipsoidal hole until 
stimulus rotated angle exceeded a given angle. 
Sample stimuli were shown as Fig. 5. Stimuli 
were presented on a gray background in the 
center of screen throughout the experiment. 
The participants were presented a stimulus of 
each type of light under its experimental 
condition and then they should estimate the 
vertical distance. For avoid participant guess 
the vertical distance of stimulus, they were told 
that the hole is an ellipse not a circle and the 
horizontal distance of it was fixed at 10.0 cm. 
Participants estimated the vertical distance of 
ellipsoidal hole according to the given 
horizontal distance. Although the time of the 
estimation task was not limited, participants 
were asked to complete this estimation task for 
each stimulus within 15 second.

Procedure 
At the beginning of the experiment, 
participants spent one minute reading on screen 
instructions to familiarize the experimental 
procedure. Before exposure the experimental 
items, participants received 3 practice trials 
which were not used in the formal experiment. 
All participants were tested individually in a 
quiet experiment room in which the light level 
was approximately 300 lux.  
To begin each trial, participants had to 
click START, which was shown on the screen, 
by pressing a mouse button. A fixation point 
appeared in the center on the screen for 500 ms 
once participant clicked START. Participants 
were required to fixate the fixation point. The 
fixation point then disappeared, and the 
stimulus was displayed. The task of the 
participants was to estimate the vertical 
distance of the hole within a stimulus. 
  12 
These findings indicate three two-way 
interactive effects. The first is a significant 
interaction between participant’s experience 
and rotated angle of solid shape on error in 
perceived distance (F2,144 = 5.08, p<.01, partial 
η2= 0.07). The interaction was illustrated in Fig. 
6, revealing the effect of rotated angle on error 
in perceived distance for participant with 
experience in using 3D software was greater 
than that for participant without experience. 
Simple effect on error in perceived distance of 
rotated angle of solid shape (20 vs 45 vs 70) 
was significant for participant with experience 
in using 3D software (18.89 vs 13.39 vs 3.54; 
F2, 76 = 48.88, p<.001, partial η2= 0.56); 
moreover, this effect was also significant for 
participant without experience (14.82 vs 12.23 
vs 6.41; F2, 76 = 23.20, p<.001, partial η2= 
0.38).

The second significant interaction was 
between rotated angle of solid shape and 
surface type on the error in perceived distance 
(F4, 324 = 3.91, p<.01, partial η2= 0.05). Fig. 7 
shows the mean error in perceived distance 
versus surface type for the range of rotated 
angle of solid shape. The error in perceived 
distance decreased when the rotaed angle of 
solid shape increased regardless the surface 
type. Simple effect on error in perceived 
distance of surface type (translucent plastic vs 
metal vs transparent glass vs wood vs dark 
brown leather) was significant for rotated angle 
at 20 degree (19.89 vs 16.35 vs 15.76 vs 15.44 
vs 16.82; F4, 308 = 3.43, p<.01, partial η2= 0.05) 
and at 75 degree condition (7.76 vs 4.18 vs 
5.67 vs 4.43 vs 2.82; F4, 308 = 4.97, p<.01, 
partial η2= 0.06); however, this effect was not 
significant for rotated angle at 45 degree 
condition (12.35 vs 12.29 vs 14.56 vs 11.90 vs 
13.02; F4, 308 = 1.44, p=.22, partial η2= 0.02).

The third significant interaction was

on the error in perceived distance (F2, 72 = 3.34, 
p<.05, partial η2= 0.09), shown as Fig. 8.

The depth of cylindrical hole was designed

on a gray background in the center of screen

estimate the depth of cylindrical hole within a 
cylinder according to a given height of the 
stimulus cylinder of 10 cm. Although the time 
of the estimation task was not limited,

estimation task for each stimulus within 15

Procedure 
The experiment was carried out using a 
Pentium M PC based Microsoft software. 
Participant sat facing the computer screen, 
which was about 50 cm in front of them. At the 
beginning of the experiment, participants spent 
one minute reading on screen instructions to 
familiarize the experimental procedure. Before 
exposure the experimental items, participants 
received 3 practice trials which were not used 
in the formal experiment. All participants were

To begin each trial, participants had to 
click START, which was shown in the center of 
the screen, by pressing a mouse button. A 
fixation point appeared in the center on the 
screen for 500 ms once participant clicked 
START. Participants were required to fixate the 
fixation point. The fixation point then 
disappeared, and the stimulus was presented. 
Participants were asked to estimate the depth of 
cylindrical hole within a cylinder. Participants 
were required to respond by pressing “Enter,” 
then stimuli disappeared. They should enter the 
size of perceived depth into a box on the screen. 
The participants repeated the procedures until 
all 45 stimuli were completed. The experiment 
was conducted in a single session of 
approximately 15-min duration.  
Data Analysis 
  16 
perceived depth of light type (spot light vs 
directionat vs point light) was significant for 
angle rotated forward at 30° (5.74 vs 16.90 vs 
5.32; F2, 77 = 6.54, p<.01) and at 45° (9.19 vs 
21.49 vs 6.30; F2, 77 = 10.60, p<.001); however, 
this effect was not significant at 15° (10.84 vs 
11.46 vs 11.92; F2, 77 = 0.50, p=.59).

The second significant interaction was 
between diameter of cylindrical hole within a 
cylinder and light type on the error in perceived 
depth (F4, 144 = 5.51, p<.00, partial η2= 0.13). 
Fig. 11 shows the mean error in perceived 
depth versus diameter of cylindrical hole for 
the light type. The effect of diameter of 
cylindrical hole on error in perceived depth 
seemed to be smaller at directionat light than 
those for spot and point light conditions. 
Simple effect on error in perceived depth of 
light type (spot light vs directionat vs point 
light) was significant for diameter of 
cylindrical hole at 16 cm (7.81 vs 16.18 vs 6.84; 
F2, 77 = 4.43, p<.05) and at 22 cm (4.87 vs

Experiment IV 
Method 
Subjects  
A total of 52 women and 32 men, college 
students and graduated between 18 and 22 
years of age (M=20.8, SD=1.2), were recruited 
as participants. Participants were divided into 
Experience and No-experience groups based on 
experience working with 3D software (for 
example, Rhino or Solid works). All 
participants reported 20/20 corrected visual 
acuity or better and were tested color vision 
based on the Ishihara color test plates. None of 
them have color deficiencies. The participants 
received a reward of 200 New Taiwan dollars 
for their participation. 
Stimulus Materials and Design 
The present experiment investigated three 
independent variables: spacing between items, 
forward-rotated angle, and view direction. 
Three spacing between items (2-, 4-, and 6-cm) 
  18 
 
To begin each trial, participants had to 
click START, which was shown on the screen, 
by pressing a mouse button. A fixation point 
appeared in the center on the screen for 500 ms 
once participant clicked START. Participants 
were required to fixate the fixation point. The 
fixation point then disappeared, and the 
stimulus was displayed. The task of the 
participants was to estimate the height of 
comparison according to the height of standard. 
The exposure time of each stimulus was 5 
second. Participants were asked to report the 
estimated height of comparison once the 
stimulus disappeared. Although the time of 
response was not limited, participants were 
asked to report within 5 second once the 
stimulus disappeared. Their responses were 
recorded. Participants should press “Enter” key 
when they finish the report procedure and then 
the next stimulus displayed. The subjects 
repeated the procedures until all 54 stimuli 
were completed. The experiment was 
conducted in a single session of approximately 
20-min duration.  
Data Analysis 
The constant error between the actual 
height of standard and the estimated height of 
comparison was obtained and analyzed. Data 
were calculated as a ratio [(actual height – 
estimated height) / actual height], measured as 
a percentage (%). The data were collected from 
the average of subject’s response under each 
experimental condition. These data were 
recorded and entered into an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) using SPSS software 
(Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value ≤ 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Results and discussion 
In Table 4 are means and standard errors 
for all parameters. A significant effect of view 
direction on error in perceived height (F1,82 = 
579.02,  p<.001, partial η2= 0.88), indicating 
the error in perceived height for view direction 
of bottom-up was less than that for top-down. 
The main effect of spacing between items on 
error in perceived height was significant (F2,164 
= 105.79,  p<.001, partial η2= 0.56). Multiple 
comparisons using LSD method showed that 
the error in perceived height of 2-cm spacing 
between items was significantly smaller than 
those for 4- and 6-cm conditions. However, 
there was no difference between 4- and 6-cm 
conditions. Analyses identified a main effect 
for forward-rotated angle on error in perceived 
height (F2,164 = 25.56, p<.001, partial η2= 0.24). 
Multiple comparisons showed that the error in 
perceived height of 15 degrees was 
significantly smaller than those for 30 and 45 
degrees; however, there was no difference 
between the latter two conditions. However, the 
effect of subject’s experience on error in 
perceived height was not found (F1,82 = 1.31, 
p=.26, partial η2= 0.02).

The third significant interaction was 
between forward-rotated angle and subject’s 
experience (F2, 164 = 5.96, p<.01, partial η2= 
0.07). Fig 15 shows forward-rotated angle had 
large effect at No-experience but little at 
Have-experience. Simple effect on error in 
perceived height of forward-rotated angle (15- 
vs 30- vs 45-degree) was significant at 
No-experience (25.70 vs 41.42 vs 44.04; F2, 82 
= 157.64, p<.001, partial η2= 0.79); but it was 
not significant at Have-experience (31.63 vs 
37.06 vs 37.94; F 2, 82 = 1.80, p=.17, partial η2= 
0.04).

The fourth significant interaction was 
between forward-rotated angle and view 
direction (F2, 164 = 65.29, p<.001, partial η2= 
0.44). The error varied across the different view 
directions, as shown in Fig. 16. These data 
implied that the error in perceived height of 
top-down direction were significantly greater 
than those for bottom-up direction, regardless 
of forward-rotated angle. Simple effect on error 
in perceived height of view direction 
(bottom-up vs top-down) was significant at

and 45-degree (29.88 vs 52.10; F 1, 83 = 110.87, 
p<.001, partial η2= 0.57).

Procedure 
   At the beginning of the experiment, 
participant was given an explanation of the task 
and asked to read the instructions to familiarize 
the experimental procedure. Before exposure 
the experimental items, participants received 3 
practice trials. All participants were tested 
individually in a quiet and dark experiment 
room in which the light level was 
approximately 15 lux. 
The test was run in two blocks separately 
by a break, one for each visualization mode. 
The visualization testing order was 
counterbalanced across participants. Each block 
consisted of 3 practice trials, followed 72 
experimental trials. In the 3D real environment 
condition, each participant was initially 
positioned at a distance of 200 cm form the 
standard stimuli, while the participant’s head 
position was controlled by a chin rest. The 
standard light was fixed on the left side; the 
comparison stimulus was on the right side. The 
experimenter fixed distance of the comparison 
stimuli randomly. Sometimes the distance from 
comparison stimulus to participant was less 
than that from standard stimulus to the 
participant and sometimes greater. At the 
presentation of comparison and standard 
stimuli, participant was asked to estimate the 
distance of comparison referring to the distance 
of standard as accurately as possible through 
the observation hole. The opening duration of 
observation hole is 5 second. Participant was 
asked to report the estimated distance of 
comparison stimuli once the observation hole 
closed. Although the time of response was not 
limited, participants were asked to report within 
5 second once the observation hole closed. The 
experimenter recorded participant’s responses. 
This stage was conducted approximately 
20-min duration. 
In the 2D virtual environment condition, 
to begin each trial, participants had to click 
START, which was shown on the screen, by 
pressing a mouse button. A fixation point 
appeared in the center on the screen for 500 ms 
once participant clicked START. Participants 
were required to fixate the fixation point. The 
fixation point then disappeared, and the 
stimulus was displayed. Participant’s task was 
to estimate the distance of comparison referring 
to the distance of standard. The exposure time 
of each stimulus was 5 second. Participants 
were asked to report the estimated distance of 
comparison once the stimulus disappeared.

2D one. Simple effect on error in perceived 
distance of light type (flickering vs 
No-flickering) was significant for 3D 
visualization (6.00 vs 3.89; F1, 71 = 12.72, 
p<.01, partial η2= 0.15); however, this effect 
was not significant for 2D condition (3.49 vs 
3.25; F1, 71 = 0.25, p=.62, partial η2= 0.04).

  The second significant interaction was 
between light color and horizontal spacing 
between stimuli (F6, 414 = 2.33, p=.03, partial 
η2= 0.04). Fig. 19 shows the mean error in 
perceived distance versus horizontal spacing 
between stimuli for the light color. Horizontal 
spacing between stimuli had large effect at blue 
and yellow but little at green and red conditions. 
Simple effect on error in perceived of 
horizontal spacing between stimuli (10 cm vs 
25 cm vs 40 cm) was significant for blue light 
(5.09 vs 4.38 vs 3.75; F2, 142 = 3.54, p=.03, 
partial η2= 0.05) and yellow one (3.48 vs 3.00 
vs 4.25; F2, 142 = 4.40, p=.01, partial η2= 0.06); 
however, this effect was not significant for red 
(4.52 vs 3.59 vs 4.37; F2, 142 = 2.03, p=.14, 
partial η2= 0.03) and green lights (4.07 vs 4.33 
vs 3.51; F2, 142 = 2.19, p=.12, partial η2= 0.03).

The third significant interaction was 
between light color and visualization mode (F3, 
207 = 3.28, p=.02, partial η2= 0.05). Fig. 20 
shows the significant effect of light color on 
error in perceived distance regardless 
visualization mode. Simple effect on error in 
perceived of light color (red vs green vs blue vs 
yellow) was significant for 2D visualization 
(3.06 vs 3.43 vs 4.15 vs 2.84; F3, 213 = 3.65, 
p=.02, partial η2= 0.05) and 3D condition (6.27 
vs 4.51 vs 4.67 vs 4.32; F 3, 213 = 2.91, p=.04, 
partial η2= 0.04). 
 
  26 
two variables of background luminance and 
horizontal spacing between stimuli did not 
significantly affect the error in perceived 
distance. Three interactive two-way effects 
were found. 
These results of whole research have 
implications for graphics- based design of 
interfaces, such as for product architecture, 
virtual reality environments, stage design, 
interior design, and building geological model.

本研究專題規劃第二年進行二項實驗，實驗一探討圖像間距、觀察方向與圖像前傾角度對
受試者估計圖像高度的誤差百分比之影響；實驗二探討光源色彩、背景亮度、刺激間距與
燈光類型等因素對判斷 2D 與 3D刺激深度誤差百分比之影響。各實驗均依研究計畫所擬定
之步驟與時程完成，與原規劃目標相符。 
    本年的研究結果將陸續整理投稿國際期刊（SSCI），預計今年十二月及明年三月間可
完成投稿事宜。 
    本研究專題的研究成果在產品設計上頗具設計實務價值，如電子商務的產品特徵呈
現、虛擬實境的圖像介面設計、建築或室內設計的影像呈現，甚至醫療上的 X光片或超音
波影像之特徵判斷等，均涉及深度知覺或距離判斷等視知覺歷程，因此在這些領域有所貢
獻。另外，藉此研究專題之執行，提升參與同學應用實驗測量法與心理物理法研究的能力，
並增加同學對視知覺心理機制及認知心理學研究範疇之了解，確實結合認知心理學理論與
設計實務，有效增進 3D 介面設計之使用性。
