generator, which is different from the conventional architecture. It is noted that the accumulated error in the 
sine/cosine generator is to be corrected by using the 164× -bit correction table. Take into account DAC 
technology, hardware cost and practical applications, the word length of the propose DDFS is set to 16-bit.

tuning latency is 8 clock cycles. All the control signals are internally generated on-chip. The chip provides 
both high throughput and low gate count.

4. Performance Analysis of the Proposed DDFS 
The number of correcting points versus the SFDRs with different ’s in the proposed DDFS is 
shown in Fig. 7. Due to trade-off between hardware cost and system performance, the correcting circuit with 
16 points is implemented in the proposed DDFS. In case of 16-bit word length, as shown in Fig. 8, the 
high-frequency SFDR is 169.7 dBc, respectively. The mid-frequency SFDR of sine and cosine is 122 dBc, as 
shown in Fig. 9, respectively. The low-frequency SFDR of sine and cosine is 85.06 dBc, as shown in Fig. 10, 
respectively. As a result, the SFDR is above 85 dBc. Table 1 shows various comparisons of the proposed 
DDFS with other methods in [11] and [13]. As one can see, the proposed DDFS is superior in terms of SFDR, 
hardware cost, and power consumption.

5. Conclusion 
The hybrid CORDIC-based multiplier-less DDFS architecture with small ROM and pipelined data path 
has been implemented. A SoC designed by 1P6M CMOS has been emulated on Xilinx XC2V6000 FPGA. For 
16-bit DDFS, the SFDR of sine and cosine using the proposed architecture are more than 85.06 dBc. 
Simulation results show that the hybrid CORDIC-based approach is superior to the traditional approach to the 
design and implementation of DDFS, in terms of SFDR, power consumption, and hardware cost. The 16-bit 
DDFS is a reusable IP, which can be implemented in various processes with efficient uses of hardware 
resources for trade-offs of performance, area, and power consumption.

Abstract: - In this paper, the high-efficient and reconfigurable lined-based architectures for the 9/7-5/3 discrete 
wavelet transform (DWT) based on lifting scheme are proposed. The proposed parallel and pipelined 
architectures consist of a horizontal filter (HF) and a vertical filter (VF). The critical paths of the proposed 
architectures are reduced. Filter coefficients of the biorthogonal 9/7-5/3 wavelet low-pass filter are quantized 
before implementation in the high-speed computation hardware In the proposed architectures, all multiplications 
are performed using less shifts and additions. The proposed reconfigurable architecture is 100% hardware 
utilization and ultra low-power. The proposed reconfigurable architectures have regular structure, simple control 
flow, high throughput and high scalability. Thus, they are very suitable for new-generation image compression 
systems, such as JPEG-2000.

1   Introduction 
In the field of digital image processing, the 
JPEG-2000 standard uses the scalar wavelet 
transform for image compression [1]; hence, the 
two-dimensional (2-D) discrete wavelet transform 
(DWT) and IDWT has recently been used as a 
powerful tool for image coding/decoding systems. 
Two-dimensional DWT/IDWT demands massive 
computations, hence, it requires a parallel and 
pipelined architecture to perform real-time or on-line 
video and image coding and decoding, and to 
implement high-efficiency application-specific 
integrated circuits (ASIC) or field programmable 
gate array (FPGA). At the kernel of the compression 
stage of the system is the DWT. 
Swelden proposed using the biorthogonal 9/7 
wavelet based on lifting scheme for lossy 
compression [2]. The symmetry of the biorthogonal 
9/7 filters and the fact that they are almost orthogonal 
[2] make them good candidates for image 
compression application. Gall and Tabatai proposed 
using the biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet based on lifting 
scheme for lossless compression [3]. The goal of the 
proposed architectures is to embed the 5/3 DWT 
computation into the 9/7 DWT computation.  The 
coefficients of the filter are quantized before 
hardware implementation; hence, the multiplier can 
be replaced by limited quantity of shift registers and 
adders. Thus, the system hardware is saved, and the 
system throughput is improved significantly. 
In this paper, we proposed a high-efficient 
architecture for the even and odd parts of 1-D DWT 
based on lifting scheme. The advantages of the 
proposed architectures are 100% hardware- 
utilization, multiplier-less, regular structure, simple 
control flow and high scalability. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 presents the lifting-based 2-D discrete 
wavelet transform algorithm, and derives new 
mathematical formulas. In Section 3, the 
high-efficient and reconfigurable architecture for the 
lifting-based 2-D DWT are proposed. Finally, 
comparison of performance between the proposed 
reconfigurable architecture and previous works is 
made with conclusions given in section 4. 
 
 
2   The Lifting-Based 2-D DWT 
Algorithm 
Usually the Lifting-based DWT requires less 
computation compared to the convolution-based 
approach. However, the savings depend on the length 
of the filters. During the lifting implementation, 
no-extra memory buffer is required because of the

Figure 12 shows architectures of line delays LD, LD1, 
LD2 and LD3 in vertical filter. We handle borders by 
the symmetric extension method [10]. Hence, the 
quality of reconstructed images can be improved.  
The proposed reconfigurable architectures for 9/7 
and 5/3 DWT reduce the critical path [13]-[19].

4   Conclusion 
Filter coefficients are quantized before 
implementation using the biorthogonal 9/7 and 5/3 
wavelet. The hardware is cost-effective and the 
system is high-speed. The proposed architecture in 
9/7 DWT reduces power dissipation by m compared 
with conventional architectures in m-bit operand 
(low-power utilization). 
The proposed architecture in 5/3 DWT with 
24-bit fixed point operations had been applied to 
512512× original images Lena is shown in Figures 
13(a) and the reconstructed images Lena is shown in 
Figure 13(b), respectively. The PSNRs of the 
reconstructed images Lena is 32.554dB. Hence, the 
proposed reconfigurable architecture has been 
applied to image compression with great satisfaction. 
In this paper, the high-efficient and low-power 
reconfigurable architecture for 2-D DWT has been 
proposed. The proposed reconfigurable architecture

9/7 DWT and aT11 for 5/3 DWT.  Buffer sizes 
are NN 94/2 +  for 9/7 DWT and NN 5.34/2 +  for 
5/3 DWT. The control complexity is very simple.  
The comparisons between previous works [13] 
[18] and this work are shown in Table 1 for 9/7 DWT 
and Table 2 for 5/3 DWT. 
The advantages of the proposed reconfigurable 
architecture are 100% hardware utilization and ultra 
low-power. The architecture has regular structure, 
simple control flow, high throughput and high 
scalability. Thus, it is very suitable for 
new-generation image compression systems, such as 
JPEG-2000. The proposed reconfigurable DWT is a 
reusable IP, which can be implemented in various 
processes and combined with an efficient use of 
hardware resources for the trade-offs of performance, 
area, and power consumption.

Abstract: - In this paper, the high-efficient and reconfigurable architectures for the 9/7-5/3 discrete wavelet 
transform (DWT) based on convolution scheme are proposed. The proposed parallel and pipelined architectures 
consist of a high-pass filter (HF) and a low-pass filter (LF). The critical paths of the proposed architectures are 
reduced. Filter coefficients of the biorthogonal 9/7-5/3 wavelet low-pass filter are quantized before 
implementation in the high-speed computation hardware. In the proposed architectures, all multiplications are 
performed using less shifts and additions. The proposed reconfigurable architecture is 100% hardware 
utilization and ultra low-power. The proposed reconfigurable architectures have regular structure, simple control 
flow, high throughput and high scalability. Thus, they are very suitable for new-generation image compression 
systems, such as JPEG-2000.

1   Introduction 
In the field of digital image processing, the 
JPEG-2000 standard uses the scalar wavelet 
transform for image compression [1]; hence, the 
two-dimensional (2-D) discrete wavelet transform 
(DWT) and IDWT has recently been used as a 
powerful tool for image coding/decoding systems. 
Two-dimensional DWT/IDWT demands massive 
computations, hence, it requires a parallel and 
pipelined architecture to perform real-time or on-line 
video and image coding and decoding, and to 
implement high-efficiency application-specific 
integrated circuits (ASIC) or field programmable 
gate array (FPGA). At the kernel of the compression 
stage of the system is the DWT. 
Daubechies proposed using the JPEG2000 
standard biorthogonal 9/7 wavelet based on 
convolution scheme for lossy compression [2]. The 
symmetry of the biorthogonal 9/7 filters and the fact 
that they are almost orthogonal [2] make them good 
candidates for image compression application. Le 
Gall proposed using the JPEG2000 standard 
biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet based on convolution 
scheme for lossless compression [2]. The goal of the 
proposed architectures is to embed the 5/3 DWT 
computation into the 9/7 DWT computation.      The

  coefficients of the filter are quantized before 
hardware implementation; hence, the multiplier can 
be replaced by limited quantity of shift registers and 
adders. Thus, the system hardware is saved, and the 
system throughput is improved significantly. 
In this paper, we proposed a high-efficient 
architecture for the even and odd parts of 1-D DWT 
based on lifting scheme. The advantages of the 
proposed architectures are 100% hardware- 
utilization, multiplier-less, regular structure, simple 
control flow and high scalability. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as 
follows. Section 2 presents the 2-D discrete wavelet 
transform algorithm, and derives new mathematical 
formulas. In Section 3, the high-efficient and 
reconfigurable architecture for the 2-D DWT are 
proposed. Finally, comparison of performance 
between the proposed reconfigurable architecture 
and previous works is made with conclusions given 
in section 4.

wavelet coefficients are quantized before hardware 
implementation. We assume that the low-pass filter 
has five tapes: 5/3 (0)h , 5/3 (1)h  and 5/3(2)h , and the 
high-pass filter has three tapes: 5/3(0)g , 5/3 (0)g . 
 
 
3   The High-Efficient and 
Reconfigurable Architectures for 5/3 
and 9/7 2-D DWT 
The proposed reconfigurable architecture for 5/3 and 
9/7 convolution based 2-D DWT including hing-pass 
filter (HF) and low-pass filter (LF) is shown in Figure 
2[5][6]. In this reconfigurable architecture, the input 
architecture are show in Figure 3,4,5 and 6,the 
multiplexers architecture are show in Figure 7,the 
architecture of hing-pass filter (HF) and the 
architecture of low-pass filter (LF)are shown in 
Figure 8 and 9, respectively. The proposed 
reconfigurable architecture for hing-pass filter (HF) 
consists of one delay units, twenty-eight multiplexers, 
six adders (It doesn’t include carrry save adder 
(CSA)) and four 9/7 wavelet coefficients processing 
elements (PEs).The proposed reconfigurable 
architecture for low-pass filter (LF) consists of 
5 5N  delay units, seventy-eight multiplexers, 
seven adders (It doesn’t include carrry save adder 
(CSA)),five 9/7 wavelet coefficients and one 5/3 
wavelet coefficients processing elements (PEs).Filter 
coefficients of the biorthogonal 9/7 and 5/3 wavelet 
low-pass filter are quantized before implementation 
in the high-speed computation hardware. In the 
proposed architecture, all multiplications are 
performed using shifts and additions after 
approximating the coefficients as a Booth binary 
recoded format (BBRF). The constant multiplier 
shown in Figure 10 consists of two carry-save-adders 
(CSA(4,2)), a Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) , and 
six hardwire shifters and replaces conventional 
multiplier )(  in processing elements (PEs). Figure 
11 shows architectures of line delay (LD) for Vertical 
filter in 2-D DWT [7]. 
The proposed reconfigurable architectures for 
9/7 and 5/3 DWT reduce the critical path [5][6].

100% hardware utilization. 
 
4   Conclusion 
Filter coefficients are quantized before 
implementation using the biorthogonal 9/7 and 5/3 
wavelet. The hardware is cost-effective and the 
system is high-speed. The proposed architecture in 
9/7 DWT reduces power dissipation by m compared 
with conventional architectures in m-bit operand 
(low-power utilization). 
Three standard images have been used for the 
test: “ Lenna ”  256 256 (I=1), “ Barbara ” 
512 512 (I=2)and “ Boat ”  512 512 (I=3). The 
number of wavelet decomposition levels (L) has been 
varied from 1 to 3 for 256 256 images and from 1 to 
4 for 512 512  image. Table 1 shows the 
peak-signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs) comparison 
among different 9/7 wavelet implementations for 
multiple images(I) and decomposition levels(L).

The proposed architecture in 9/7 and 5/3 DWT with 
20-bit fixed point operations had been applied to 
512512 original images Lena is shown in Figures 
12(a) and 13(a)and the reconstructed images Lena is 
shown in Figure 12(b) and 13(b), respectively. The 
PSNRs of the reconstructed images Lena are 
55.701dB and 42.625dB, respectively. Hence, the 
proposed reconfigurable architecture has been 
applied to image compression with great satisfaction. 
In this paper, the high-efficient and low-power 
reconfigurable architecture for 2-D DWT has been 
proposed. The proposed reconfigurable architecture

critical paths are 2 aT  for 9/7 and 5/3 DWT, and the 
output latency time are aT49  for 9/7 and 5/3 DWT.  
Buffer sizes are 14)2/25(2  NN  for 9/7 and 5/3 
DWT, respectively. The control complexity is very 
simple. The comparisons between previous works [6] 
[8] and this work are shown in Table 2 for 9/7 DWT. 
The advantages of the proposed reconfigurable 
architecture are 100% hardware utilization and ultra 
low-power. The architecture has regular structure, 
simple control flow, high throughput and high 
scalability. Thus, it is very suitable for 
new-generation image compression systems, such as 
JPEG-2000. The proposed reconfigurable DWT is a 
reusable IP, which can be implemented in various 
processes and combined with an efficient use of 
hardware resources for the trade-offs of performance, 
area, and power consumption.

Abstract: - Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse DCT (IDCT) have been widely used in many image 
processing systems. In this paper, a novel linear-array of DCT and IDCT is derived from the data flow of 
subband decompositions representing the factorized coefficient matrices in the matrix formulation of the 
recursive algorithm. For increasing the throughput as well as decreasing the hardware cost, the input and output 
data are reordered. The proposed 8-point DCT/IDCT processor with four multipliers, simple adders, and less 
registers and ROM storing the immediate results and coefficients, respectively, has been implemented on FPGA. 
The linear-array DCT/IDCT processor with the computation complexity )8/5( NO and hardware complexity 
)2/(NO  is fully pipelined and scalable for variable length DCT/IDCT computations. 
 
Key-Words: - DCT/IDCT, subband decomposition, linear-array, pipelined, scalable. 
  
1   Introduction 
Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is one of the major 
operations in various image/video compression 
standards [1]. Though fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
can be used to implement DCT, it requires 
complex-valued computations; and moreover, 
N-point DCT by FFT contains )12(log NO stages. 
The conventional DCT architectures using 
distributed arithmetic involve complex hardware 
with a great number of registers [2-6]. Other 
commonly used DCT architectures with matrix 
formulation and distributed memory [7-8] are 
however not suited for VLSI implementation because 
the hardware complex is proportional to the length of 
DCT, which leads to the scalability problem of 
variable length DCT computations. In this paper, we 
propose a novel linear-array architecture for scalable 
DCT/IDCT implementation. 
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. 
In section 2, we propose the fast DCT/IDCT 
algorithm based on subband decomposition. In 
section 3, a programmable and reconfigurable 
FPGA-based implementation with low hardware cost 
is proposed for the fast DCT/IDCT computation. The 
performance comparison with conclusions can be 
found in section 4.

Fig. 8 shows block diagram of the proposed DCT 
computation; one of the advantages is that 8R  is 
orthogonal, and all of the sub-matrices of 8Fˆ  are 
orthonormal.

As 8R  is orthogonal and all of the sub-matrices of 
8Fˆ  are orthonormal, the inverse of 8R  and 8Fˆ  can 
be obtained easily. In addition, it takes only twenty 
multiplication operations for both DCT and IDCT. 
 
 
3   A Linear Array for DCT and IDCT 
Based on the proposed approach to fast DCT 
computation shown in Fig. 8, an efficient architecture 
for implementing the fast DCT/IDCT processor is 
thus presented in this section. Recall that the DCT of 
a signal, 8x , can be efficiently obtained by 
8888
ˆ xRFC  . Let 888 xRy  , then we have 
888
ˆ yFC  . The matrix-vector multiplication of 
88 xR  , in which six CSA(3,2)s (carry-save-adder 
(3,2)) and one CLA (carry-look-ahead-adder) [9-10] 
are utilized, and therefore four simple-addition time 
and one CLA computation time is required to 
compute each element of 8y . The multiplier-array 
(MA) consisted of four multipliers and the 
CLA-array (CA) consisted of eight CLAs, 
respectively, which are used to compute the 
matrix-vector computation of 88ˆ yF  ; thus, only one 
multiplication time with one CLA computation time

This research presents a hybrid COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer
(CORDIC) algorithm for designs and implementations of the direct
digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS). The proposed multiplier-less
architecture with small ROM (16X4 -bit) and pipelined data path
provides a spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of more than 84.4 dBc.A
SoC (System on Chip) has been designed by 1P6M CMOS, and then
emulated on the Xilinx FPGA. It is shown that the hybrid CORDIC-based
architecture is suitable for VLSI implementations of the DDFS in
terms of hardware cost, power consumption, and SFDR. In case of 16-
bit word length, the high-frequency SFDR is 169.7 dBc.As one can see,
the proposed DDFS is superior in terms of SFDR, hardware cost, and
