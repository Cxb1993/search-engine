Abstract: Many semiconductor manufacturing processes have, by nature, multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) variables. For the ﬁrst-order MIMO process with a linear drift, the
double multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (dMEWMA) controller is a popular
run-to-run (R2R) controller for adjusting the process mean to a desired target. The long-term
stability of this closed-loop MIMO system has not been thoroughly investigated before and is the
focus of our study. The stability of this MIMO system using a controller with estimated process
parameters depends on whether an initial input-output (I-O) predicted model can be obtained
successfully in advance (i.e., oﬀ-line) to accurately and precisely estimate these process parameters.
However, the predicted model is typically constructed during an oﬀ-line DOE/RSM stage, based on
a random sample from the I-O variables, and therefore, the sample size and the strength of linear
relationship between I-O variables play major roles in determining the stability of the process. In
this paper we ﬁrst obtain the stability conditions for the MIMO process. Obviously these conditions
depend on the estimated controller, and consequently, one of the conditions is expressed in terms of
a probability. We then derive a formula for the adequate sample size required to achieve stability
for the closed-loop MIMO system with a guaranteed probability. We also describe how the oﬀ-line
DOE/RSM is conducted to obtain process parameters estimates. Two practical MIMO examples
are given to illustrate the proposed procedure. Finally, a study is given to demonstrate the impacts
of the covariance structure of I-O variables on the required sample size.

the stability conditions of a process under a dEWMA controller with arbitrary discount
factors, for a wide class of the process disturbances.
For a controller to be eﬀective, it should depend on the covariance structure between the
I-O variables, which is normally estimated from a predicted model. In practice, since this
predicted model is built based on a random sample from the process I-O variables, the sample

Despite the frequent applications of MIMO systems in semiconductor industry, the sample
size determination problem for the long-term stability of the MIMO system has not been
thoroughly addressed in the literature, and is the focus of our current study. The rest
of this paper is organized as follows. First, Section 2 contains the problem formulation,
which includes descriptions of the double multivariate EWMA (dMEWMA) controller for
a linearly drifted MIMO process and its stability conditions. Section 3.1 describes how an
oﬀ-line DOE/RSM is conducted to obtain an I-O predicted model. Section 3.2 states the
main result on the minimum sample size needed to obtain a precise estimate of the I-O
covariance structure during the DOE/RSM stage so the resulting controller can make the
process asymptotically stable with a guaranteed probability. It is shown that the sample
size depends not only on the canonical correlation coeﬃcient between process I-O variables,
but also on the eigen-structure of input variables of the MIMO process. We also propose
a 3-step procedure to obtain the minimum sample size when the process parameters are
estimated so the desired stability probability can still be guaranteed. Section 4 uses two
examples of the silicon epitaxy process (Sachs, Hu, and Ingolfsson (1995)) and a thermal
diﬀusion process to illustrate the proposed procedure. Section 5 describes the impacts of the
covariance structure of I-O variables on the sample size. Finally some concluding remarks
are given in Section 6.
2 The MIMO Process and its stability conditions
Due to the fact that the range of allowable adjustment of input variables is very narrow, the
process I-O relation of a drifted MIMO process can be suitably described by
Y t = α + Bxt−1 + κ(t− 1) + ηt, (1)
6
The recipe xt is chosen in such a way that the predicted value, Yˆ t+1, of the process perfor-
mance variables at time t + 1 will meet the desired target; that is,
Yˆ t+1 = at + Bˆxt + Dt = τ ,
which is our constraint in (6). Obviously, there may be inﬁnitely many possible solutions
for xt when m > n (a likely scenario). Hence, we use the criterion that the amount of
adjustment between xt and xt−1 is minimized (i.e., the cost of adjustment is minimized) to
determine an optimal recipe xt in (3).
Minimizing the output deviation is also a reasonable approach to choosing a recipe. For
example, Rajagopal and Del Castillo (2003) has proposed a ridge-solution controller. The
rationale behind their controller is to
Minimize ‖E(Y t+1)− τ‖2 , subject to: x′txt < ρ2.
The controller turned out to be
xt = (Bˆ
′
Bˆ + μIm)
−1Bˆ
′
(τ − at −Dt).
With diﬀerent choices of μ (which is related to ρ), the stability conditions of this controller
can be obtained and may not be the same as ours.
A closed-loop system is called asymptotically stable if the mean of its process output
converges to the desired target, while the asymptotic covariance is ﬁnite. That is,
lim
t→∞
E(Y t) = τ , (7)
and
lim
t→∞
trace (Cov(Y t)) < ∞. (8)

Result 1 Assuming that the process disturbance {ηt} follows a vector ARIMA(p,d, q) model,
a dMEWMA controller in (3) (with a pair of discount matrices Ω1 and Ω2) satisﬁes the
asymptotic stability if (a) dj ≤ 2, ∀1 ≤ j ≤ n and (b) all absolute eigenvalues of Q are less
than 1.
In practice, condition (a) is very likely to hold since a higher-order non-stationary process
is rare. Hence, we only focus on the condition (b). To determine Ω1 and Ω2, ﬁrst we note
that these two discount matrices should be strongly related to process disturbance ηt and
the gain matrix B. Assuming that the process distribution of ηt is known, Ingolfsson and
Sachs (1993), Del Castillo (1999) and Tseng et al. (2002 a, b) have proposed criteria (such as
asymptotic mean square deviation, trade-oﬀ between long-term and transient performance of
the process output, and total MSE, etc) to determine the optimal discount factors (matrices).
This approach is related to the process output performance. However, it is not so directly
related to the global stability in our study.
The stability condition with arbitrary discount matrices is rather complicated; but as far
as asymptotic stability is concerned, scalar discount matrices will suﬃce. Let Ω1 = ω1In
and Ω2 = ω2In. By forcing the feasible region of (ω1, ω2) to be S = {(ω1, ω2)|(ω1, ω2) ∈
[0, 1]× [0, 1]}, we obtain the global stability condition in the following theorem.
Theorem 1 Let Ω1 = ω1In and Ω2 = ω2In. Under the assumptions of Result 1, for
arbitrary (ω1, ω2) from [0, 1] × [0, 1], the corresponding dMEWMA controller will give an
asymptotically stable MIMO process, if
the smallest eigenvalue of BˆBˆ
′
(BBˆ
′
)−1 ≥ 3/4. (10)
Proof of the result is given in the Appendix 1.
Let us consider the following example.
10
There are some concerns in Example 1 and (10). In addition to the fact that the true
gain matrix is not known in advance, the process (I-O) predicted model was built based on
a random sample obtained at the oﬀ-line stage (see Figure 1); i.e., Bˆ is random. To avoid
assuming a known gain matrix or distribution for the disturbance, the following issues for a
dMEWMA feedback controller need to be addressed.
(1) Assume that the process I-O variables are jointly distributed according to a multivari-
ate normal distribution. What is the number of oﬀ-line experimental runs needed to
guarantee a probability P ∗ that the controlled process (with arbitrary scalar discount
matrices) will be stable? That is, how to determine an adequate sample size for the
sample such that
P
(
the smallest eigenvalue of BˆBˆ
′
(BBˆ
′
)−1 ≥ 3/4
)
≥ P ∗. (13)
(2) To what extent do the covariance (or correlation) structure aﬀect the sample size for
meeting the asymptotic stability conditions?
3 Oﬀ-line sample size determination
To obtain Bˆ and to compute the probability (13) of asymptotic stability for sample size
determination during the oﬀ-line DOE stage, one needs a statistical model for process I-O
variables.
3.1 Oﬀ-line DOE/RSM stage
At t = 1, (1) becomes Y 1 = α + Bx0 + η1. Since it has no prior history, η1 is simply a
multivariate white noise 1, according to the deﬁnition. The I-O model above then becomes
12
and
A22 =
N∑
i=1
(xi − x¯)(xi − x¯)′.
Then Bˆ = A12A
−1
22 is the maximum likelihood estimator of B and the conditional distribu-
tion of Bˆ given Z ′ = ((x1 − x¯), (x2 − x¯), . . . , (xN − x¯)) is Nn,m(B,Σ11·2 ⊗ (Z ′Z)−1). That
is,
vec(Bˆ
′
) ∼ Nnm(vec(B′),Σ11·2 ⊗ (Z ′Z)−1), (16)
where A ⊗ B denotes the Kronecker product of A and B. Let β′c = c′B and b′c = c′Bˆ.
From (16), we have
bc ∼ N
(
βc, σ
2(Z ′Z)−1
)
,
where σ2 = c′(Σ11·2)c. From (10), note that the smallest eigenvalue of BˆBˆ

(BBˆ

)−1 ≥ 3/4
is equivalent to

3.2 Sample size determination
The minimum sample size needed to obtain Bˆ or bc that ensures the asymptotic stability
with probability P ∗ for a dMEWMA control scheme with arbitrary scalar discount matrices
can be obtained from (13) as follows (Proof in Appendix 2).

with mean γ, but its asymptotic variance is diﬃcult to obtain. Therefore we propose the
following procedure to determine a conservative sample size for stability of the proposed
MIMO controller for the case with unknown I-O covariance structure.
Step 1: We take a random sample of size N0 on (Y
′,X ′)′, where N0 should be moderately
large, say N0 ≥ 30.
Step 2: Choose p (0 < p < 1) and α (0 < α < 1) such that p(1 − α) ≥ P ∗. Treating
the sample obtained in Step 1 as the ”population,” we use the Bootstrap method
(with Bootstrap sample size N0) to obtain an approximate 100(1 − α)% upper
conﬁdence limit γˆ∗N0,1−α for γ; i.e.,
P (γ < γˆ∗N0,1−α) ≈ 1− α. (19)
Step 3: Compute
N∗α,p,N0 = (m + 1) + 16(zp)
2γˆ∗N0,1−α, (20)
and let
Nmin = max(N0, N
∗
α,p,N0
). (21)
Then Nmin is a conservative sample size to achieve the asymptotic stability with
probability P ∗ for the proposed double MEWMA controller; i.e., if we use any
sample size greater than or equal to Nmin for estimating B in DOE/RSM (in
Section 3.1), we have
P
(
the smallest eigenvalue of BˆBˆ
′
(BBˆ
′
)−1 ≥ 3/4
)
≥ P ∗, (22)
at least approximately, where both the smallest eigenvalue and Nmin are treated
as random. Proof of this result is given in Appendix 3.
In the next section, we use two examples to demonstrate the proposed method.
18
Hence, a minimum sample size, Nmin, is
Nmin = max{40, 52} = 52. (26)
The increase in the sample size in (26) over (24) is due to the fact that we need to estimate
the unknown covariance structure in the process I-O model.
Example 3 (Thermal diﬀusion furnace)
Thermal diﬀusion process is an essential step in many semiconductor manufacturing pro-
cesses. It is used to implant impurities into silicon wafers by heating the silicon substrate to
a high temperature. The thickness of upper, center and lower level are of primary concern
(output variables) and there are ﬁve heating zones as input variables in a thermal diﬀusion
furnace. Figure 3 shows the process I-O structure.
Figure 3: Thermal diﬀusion furnace and its I-O structure.
For illustrative purpose, we assume that the covariance matrix of I-O variables is known
with

nation of) sample size.
(B) Keeping ρ11 and ρ22 ﬁxed, what is the impact of ρ12 on the sample size.
(C) Keeping ρ ﬁxed, what are the impacts of standard deviations of input variables on the
sample size.
Generally speaking, it is rather complicated to address the above issues for a general
m× n MIMO system, therefore we only restrict to the case of (2× 2) MIMO systems.
Example 4 (Example 1 continued)
From (23), we have (σY1 , σY2) = (0.259, 0.239), (σX1 , σX2) = (1.245, 3.29), and the correlation
matrix of the I-O variables

Case A: Assume that the coeﬃcients in ρ are kept ﬁxed, except for the values of 0.15
and −0.32 of ρ11 and ρ22 are replaced by ρX1X2 and ρY1Y2 , respectively. Table 2 shows
the sample sizes (Nmin) under all possible combinations of 0.142 ≤ ρX1X2 ≤ 0.160 and
−0.328 ≤ ρY1Y2 ≤ −0.310. Note that with such changes, it no longer guarantees that the
new ρ is a positive deﬁnite matrix. Hence, we simply use asterisk to represent the cells
for which sample sizes are not meaningful. From Table 2, it demonstrates some interesting
patterns. For ﬁxed ρX1X2, Nmin is increasing in ρY1Y2, while for ﬁxed ρY1Y2 , Nmin is decreasing
in ρX1X2 except for the cells with (ρX1X2 , ρY1Y2) = (0.16,−0.328) and (−0.16,−0.326).
Case B: Assume that the coeﬃcients in ρ are kept unchanged, except for the value of 0.995
(for ρ12) is replaced by ρY1X2 . Figure 4 shows a plot of the sample size with respect to ρY1X2 .

largest. When population parameters are unknown, they should be estimated by oﬀ-line
experiments, during the selection process. Some further concluding remarks are listed as
follows:
(1) Stability conditions of a dMEWMA controller under general discount matrices:
Generally speaking, even when a pair of discount matrices is known and pre-ﬁxed, the
sampling distribution of the largest, absolute eigenvalue of BˆBˆ
′
(BBˆ
′
)−1 in (13) is
complicated. Hence, it is not easy to obtain global stability analytically. No doubt, it
is an interesting topic for future research.
(2) Sample size needed to meet the stability conditions with a sMEWMA controller:
Set κ = 0 in (1) and Ω2 = 0 in (5). Then, for a non-drifted MIMO process, a double
MEWMA controller reduces to a single MEWMA controller (Tseng, Chou and Lee,
2002b) and the sample size for the asymptotic stability conditions with probability P ∗
becomes
Nmin ≥ (m + 1) + 4(zP ∗)2
(
emax
emin
)
1− ρ2min
ρ2min
. (29)
Comparing (29) with (17), the minimum sample size for a sMEWMA controller is
about a quarter of the sample size for a dMEWMA controller.
(3) In order to tune discrete manufacturing processes eﬃciently, Del Castillo (2005) pro-
posed a closed-loop disturbance identiﬁcation procedure and a controller for the gain-
plus noise processes. By assuming a speciﬁc process disturbance (such as IMA(1, 1)
with drift process), the optimal proportional-integral (PI) controller (which includes
EWMA controller as a special case) can be obtained by balancing output variance and
adjustment variance. Next, all unknown parameters in this model can be estimated via

Taking the inverse function of Φ on both sides, we obtain (17) of Theorem 2. Note that

cβc has a mean of 1 (which is signiﬁcantly large than 3/4) and its variance is
O(1/N). Even using N = 5 in Example 2, the probabilities of both sides of the above
approximation are equal to 0.953 and 0.940, respectively. Hence, as N is moderately large,
the approximation above is also a reasonable one.
