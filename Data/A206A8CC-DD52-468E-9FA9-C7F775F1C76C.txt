1. Introduction 
Fuzzy models can be constructed from given 
nonlinear system equations by the idea of local 
approximation [1,2]. Such a way is similar to 
local linearization technique, so each fuzzy 
subspace present the individual distribution state, 
that is such kind behavior very properly describe 
the characteristic of data clustering. This structure 
of fuzzy model is called the proper clustering 
structure. Another way of constructing fuzzy 
models is to directly use input-output training 
data. Traditional learning algorithms [3-12]for 
this kind of approaches are to tune system 
parameters according to modeling error, and 
without considering the training data distribution. 
Thus, the structure of the fuzzy model, after 
learning, especially when the training data with 
outliers, will make its specific fuzzy subspaces 
form the disorderly distribution state. Such kind 
structure of fuzzy model usually will be improper 
clustering structure.  
This project integrates the modeling error 
and data cluster in a novel fuzzy modeling 
approach. The original RCA clustering algorithm 
[13,14] adopts the idea of robust statistics to 
reduce the effects of outliers and the concept of 
competitive agglomeration to determine the 
proper number of clusters. The RFRA clustering 
algorithm [15] is modified from RCA, Instead of 
using clustering concept in partitioning the fuzzy 
subspaces, it attempted to find fuzzy regressions 
for fuzzy rules. It is not considered the data 
distribution and usually, the resultant fuzzy 
partition may be improper clustering structure. 
The proposed approach is integrated these two 
competitive agglomeration processes. Firstly, it 
called data clustering process, that is, the 
prototype parameters are the centers and 
variances of clusters. Next, called regression 
clustering process, the prototype parameters are 
the parameter vector in linear regression. Thus, 
the Robust Proper Structure Fuzzy Regression 
Algorithm (RPSFR) can not only obtaining the 
TSK fuzzy model that against the outlier, and also 
with proper clustering structure. Moreover, the 
accuracy of the TSK modeling is also to improve. 
If more precision is required, it also adopts a 
so-called Annealing Robust Backpropagation 
(ARBP) [16] learning algorithm to fine-tuning.

TSK fuzzy models are also implemented in our 
study. One is the FCRM clustering algorithm 
with BP learning algorithm, Self-Constructing 
Neural Fuzzy Inference Network (SONFIN) and 
the other is the RFRA clustering algorithm with 
robust BP learning algorithm. For RPSFR, the 
cluster’s agglomeration process is shown as Fig.1. 
The number of cluster is agglomerated to 4 
clusters at the 6-th epoch and be stable about the 
50-th epoch. We can find that the cardinalities of 
4 clusters are very nearly. It means that the 
constructed TSK fuzzy model with proper 
clustering structure. After training with 
fine-tuning, the RPSFR is the best one in RMSE 
that can refer to Table. I and Fig.2, and the 
structure is a proper clustering structure, the 
others are not, as shown in Fig.3. For control 
application, the problem of balancing an inverted 
pendulum on a cart is illustrated. When applying 
adaptive control law, its response is closely the 
desired curve. It is showed in Fig.4. In figure, 
C.M. denoted the fuzzy controller from coarse 
model, A.L. denoted the fuzzy controller with 
adaptive law. 
Various TSK modeling approaches have been 
proposed in the literature. However, all of them 
only consider the modeling error and result an 
improper clustering structure. In this paper, a 
robust TSK fuzzy modeling approach termed as 
Robust Proper Structure Fuzzy Regression 
(RPSFR) Algorithm is proposed. It is proposed to 
simultaneously define fuzzy subspaces and find 
the parameters in the consequent parts of TSK 
rules. This clustering algorithm not only finds 
regression instead of clustering for rules, but also 
has robust capability against outliers and with a 
proper clustering structure that is very suitable to 
describe a dynamic system. The proposed robust 
TSK fuzzy modeling approach is tested for 
example and indeed showed superior 
performance in our simulation.
