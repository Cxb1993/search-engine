rous surface of seabed. For numerical modeling, the 
stream function-vorticity formulation, associated 
with evolved boundary-fitted grid system and the 
finite-analytic discretization method, is applied in 
this study. We plane to utilize a numerical wave- 
maker at upstream to generate the incident waves as 
our desired, meanwhile to control several geometric 
parameters of slopping ripple such as bottom slope, 
length and height of ripples, and the total length of 
ripple bottom in the study. According to the convec-
tive flow determined and following Fick’s law of 
diffusion, we formulate and calculate the 
time-dependent concentration fields of several kinds 
of suspensions as well. Those suspensions of dif-
ferent densities from the water will be considered 
here so that the simulation is most realistic.

二、計畫緣由與目的 
潮汐與水波動現象引致水體運動，擾動水中
結構物(包括自然或人工底床岸壁、潛堤護岸與底
棲植物等等)附近流場，影響底床沖淤狀態，因而
形成海洋海岸地區地形演變；底床擾動流場亦為
漂移底質、浮游生物等可移動懸浮物質
(suspension)的起動、傳輸與沉降之主要機制而影
響海岸局部生態平衡。即使於平直灘線(shoreline)
的海岸區域，實際海床斷面甚少為平坦地形，這
些自然或人工形成的地形中，特別是淺海處的底
床，受波浪運動影響密切。覆蓋其上的沉積物(包
含沙粒、汙染或營養質等與浮游底棲生物及其遺
骸) 在水體往復運動與底床交互作用下，產生啟
動、傳輸、沉降過程。或繼續漂浮在海中，或終
形成剛性或可變形性、不同透水性之孔隙底床結
構。這些底床結構具有不同的幾何外形，可包含
規則性多尺度的沙漣(ripples)或其他不規則形狀
(如礁狀、沙丘、沙洲等等)；底床之透水性與可
變形性往往受這些底質之堆積作用 (例如土粒產
生護甲、聚合、吸附、填隙、沉陷、膨脹、變形、
液化等)而有很大差異。沙漣(ripples)為海岸常見
地形之一，其形成機制除了受波浪致流場之往復
震盪作用產生質量傳輸外，由於沙漣本身的起伏
波狀地形相對提高了底床粗糙度，使流體與底床
間剪應力效應增大，故沙漣底床亦會隨著波浪相
位變化改變流動型態，而產生局部流體加速與減
速 運 動 ， 並 可 能 使 非 穩 態 邊 界 層 流 離
(separation)，伴隨渦流(vortex)逸散、衰減等流場
型態機制並衍生其他移動底質動量傳輸(如渦動
沙漣機制過程)，影響如懸浮質對流(advection)方
向與輸送濃度分布範圍，進而使海灘地貌和生態
系統發生變遷演化等。這些發生在海岸淺水地區
波流動機制與傳輸過程都有相當程度的複雜
性，若能利用水動力基本理論或模式推算來分析
了解相關現象，將有助於我們管理與監控海岸環
境的能力。前人研究基於各種波浪理論搭配邊界
層理論已有甚多成果散見於期刊文獻發表，即使
考慮波狀底床上之渦流發展，也常使用單沙漣配
合周期邊界條件考慮之(使用google 或yahoo可
搜尋甚多資源)。這些簡化成果或許提供甚多有用
的資訊可以使用，然而如前所述，波浪致流在可
透水性移動沙漣的流場型態並非單純波浪理論
配合邊界層理論或用周期對稱性處理的方式所
均能涵蓋；雖然過去也曾有相關剛性或柔性透水
孔質結構物或底床之問題使用全域流場模式被
研究(也可在網上搜尋到甚多文獻)，然而研究在
各種非線性波動致流場條件下，精確配合曲線座
標解析任意可變形與透水性波形沙漣之分離流
動，並考慮不同透水條件(例如傳統以壓力差決定
滲流速度之Darcy’s 定律外，尚可以濃度差、溫
度或鹽度差、應力差、甚或化學能差等不同方式
決定，端視何種底質之傳輸性質而定)的細部分
析，則較為少見。本計劃將考慮受非線性含複頻
(multi- frequency)或周期性的長波(cn波)或有限振
幅波(Stokes波)作用，探討在固定或可移動的透水
多孔隙底質斜坡沙漣互制流場，產生可隨時間變
形底床邊界層、渦流逸散而影響不同懸浮底質擴
散過程之動動量傳輸的問題，以及底床反向影響
水波散射(scattering)變形的影響，進行細部研究。

繁盛區域，也是人類休憩自然景觀互動重要界

形狀的流場特性。近年來電腦計算速度迅速提
升，數值模擬流場現象被廣泛應用。物理實驗對
於沙漣演變的觀察研究需仰賴足夠長波浪水槽
與消波設施來讓沙漣發展至穩定，而進行穩定沙
漣流場的觀察則需要有足夠高時間精度的流場
可視化技術來解析與捕捉現象，且沙漣底床模型
是否設計符合實際底床形狀亦需考量在內，採用
數值實驗正可彌補實際觀測上的不足，相關文獻
如Smith and Stansby (1984), Hara and Mei (1990), 
De Angelis et al. (1997), Fredsøe et al. (1999), 
Huang and Dong (2002), Kim (2004), Cheng et al. 
(2006), Ourmieres and Mouaze (2007)等。 
由文獻可發現：關於沙漣地形與水波互制研
究問題，在過去理論尚未完備時所使用的實驗觀
察、數值模擬等研究方法，迄今仍廣為研究此類
問題者持續採用。實驗觀測需考量精良造波設
備、足夠空間建置波浪水槽、良好的下游端消波
設施、影像擷取(如PIV)與分析技術等配合，若欲
進行穩定沙漣底床方面研究，還需有製作良好之
形狀模型技術配合，大抵而言，仍然需要耗費大
量時間人力資源方見其功。相對而言，數值模擬
方法近年的大幅演進，除了歸功於高速電腦的運
算核心技術的提升外，尚因軟體發展而使數值處
理方法越近實用，若干細節技術問題(如離散方
法、計算法則、格網配置、計算精度效率等技術)
也較有能力獲得改進。本研究因而採取數值方法
為主要研究工作，而以現有文獻之實驗資料驗證
為輔方式進行。 
本研究主要發展(或修改)現有二維數值流場
通用模式，以應用於研究水波與沙漣底床互制問
題，上游端模擬虛擬造波板運動產生非線性波(如
Ur>30但模式應用上並未受到此限制)，計算域內
部布置系列週期沙漣地形，下游採用開放性數值
邊界條件。非線性波主要模擬產生橢圓餘弦(cn)
波、Stokes波或複頻非線性波(不同頻帶寬)，沙漣
地形除了考慮目前常見對稱形狀，亦考慮模擬目
前較少涉及研究非對稱形狀(實際非線性波浪所
產生沙漣屬於此類型，參見Cheng rt al. (2007))，
並考慮透水性與變形性(以不同參數值經由經驗
公式給定移動型態)。在沙漣地形尺度上將模擬較
大範圍尺度形狀(漣高可至水深一半到甚小但使
用足夠引響波動之鋪設長度)，亦可為複頻(波長)
產生較不規則具複周期性沙漣，藉由數值流場可
視化以瞭解不同沙漣地形與水波交互作用下所
產生的流場現象，並進一步考慮沙漣地形與斜坡
底床的結合，模擬更為複雜變化海岸坡地地形，
助於瞭解非線性水波與實際沙漣地形相互作用
流場現象。根據不同透水條件考慮懸浮質
(suspension)濃度擴散問題，可包含浮游生物及懸
浮沙質(在沙漣面上具不同之界面條件)等受流場
傳輸分佈作用之模擬。這些物質密度將與水相
異，而受濃度含量影響其運動機制。 (註；若略
輕於或近於水密度則受水體推移形成漂浮質點
運動，則須以各別質點分別考慮，類似申請人著
作10,張志華，唐啟釗2007之方式。)。 
三、計畫內容與方法概述 
本計畫主要研究非線性水波與固定或可移
動的透水沙漣流場互制作用及質動量傳輸現
象，以流函數-渦度數值模式發展與應用於所欲
研究問題。此模式將有下列特性，謹分述如下： 
(1)採用有限解析(Finite-analytic)離散法離
散控制方程式，並根據本年度正進行之國科會
計畫，整合所發展之計算法則與求邊界導數方
式應用於本計畫； 
(2)發展濃度場擴散方程式以及可移動透水
性多孔介質界面邊界條件； 
(2)應用瞬時移動貼壁格網生成法處理所有
移動邊界(自由水面、造波板、沙漣面)條件； 
(3)上游使用虛擬造波板運動造波方式產生
水波。 
因此類計算問題涉及瞬時波動水面、上游
運動之造波板及波狀地形等移動或不規則邊
界，未來需克服數值計算上將會遇到的問題： 
1.  移動邊界的處理： 
如前所述本研究中涉及的移動邊界主要有
瞬時波動水面、上游運動造波板與可移動透水
性多孔介質界面邊界。前兩種邊界已有成功應
用的研究成果，而後一種邊界條件較為複雜，
詳論於後。這三種移動邊界位置一旦求得或給
定，即可採用代數函數組合法，生成瞬時貼壁
格網系統。這種格網生成法可以兼顧精度與計
算效率來處理此類問題，物理域邊界雖為瞬時
不規則變動，但利用代數函數設定物理域中格

 solving the vorticity and velocity field over a wavy bottom (Hara and 
Mei (1990), Blondeaux and Vittori (1991), Fredsøe et al. (1999), Kim 
(2004), etc.). 
     In the present study, a two-dimensional general flow model is 
developed to investigate particular flow features induced by the cnoidal 
wave over a wavy bed. This laminar flow model based on stream 
function-vorticity formulation is discretized by the finite analytic (FA) 
method. In addition, the fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic 
boundary conditions on the transient free water surface are best treated 
in a boundary-fitted grid system for computational economics. In order 
to validate our calculated results, numerical solutions are compared 
with theoretical solutions or experimental data, available for the flat 
bed and the wavy bed. We further study the flow filed under wave over 
a wavy bed by the evolution of flow pattern, velocity profiles within the 
boundary layer and particle trajectories during wave propagation. 
 
MATHEMATICAL FORMULATIONS 
 
Governing Equations 
The flow is assumed to be two dimensional (2D), viscous and 
incompressible in the present study. A convenient way to perform this   
analysis is to formulate the flow field with the streamfunction–vorticity 
(  ) model because only two variables are solved in this type of 
the Navier-Stokes model, instead of the coupling fields of pressure and 
velocity vector in the three primitive-variable model. In this model,   
is governed by the Poisson equation while   is by the unsteady 
convective-diffusive vorticity transport equation in a general coordinate 
system (ξ, η; τ): 
2    , (1)

where all quantities have been dimensionless, with the scales referred 
to the undisturbed water depth h , the linear wave velocity gh  and 
the transport time /h g (where g  is the gravitational constant). The 
only non-dimensional parameter in the model is the Reynolds number 
Re /h gh  , in which   is the kinematic viscosity of fluid. Here 
the subscripts in coordinates and time denote their differentiations. To 
deal accurately with the transient boundary geometry and nonlinear 
boundary conditions on the free surface for the    field, we apply 
the general curvilinear coordinates (ξ, η; τ)=( ξi; τ) for i =1, 2, instead 
of using the Cartesian coordinates (x, y; t), to construct a boundary-
conformed grid system in analysis so that the Laplacian is defined by

Initial and Boundary Conditions 
Water waves on the free surface are generated by a piston-type 
wavemaker at far upstream while a rigid wavy bed is in part of the mid-
section, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The flow domain is within 1 ≤ ξ ≤ ξmax, 
and 1 ≤ η ≤ ηmax which maps respectively to X(τ) ≤ x ≤ Xmax and yb(ξ) ≤ 
y ≤ ζ(ξ; τ). 
(1) Initial Condition

not yet disturbed initially. Thus, in the entire domain at t = τ = 0

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In this study we consider four flow cases to distinguish from different 
bottom setups.  Two are for the waves interactions over a flat bed 
(cases A and B as shown in Table 1), and the other two are those over a 
wavy bed (cases C and D). In case D, we use the same conditions as in 
Fredsøe’s experiment (1999), except for the downstream radiation 
condition Eq. (15) applied at exit x = 40. There are two criteria conditions 
to examine the stability of ripple. Sleath (1984) reported that vortex 
ripples exist for a0 / Lr ≥ 0.4, where a0 is the wave orbital amplitude and 
Lr is the ripple wavelength. The ripple steepness (Hr / Lr) of about 0.17 
leads to an equilibrium ripple, according to previous studies. In case C, 
ripple bed with these conditions is thus studied. We consider physical 
water depth 0.4m (Re ≒ 5×105) in present cases

                  In all cases, computational length is set 40h. There are 1001 
lines in horizontal direction, and 26 lines in vertical 
direction. All physical variables need to converge to the 
precision of 10-6. 
 
Validation of Wave-Induced Velocity Profiles on Even Bottom 
We first test the cnoidal waveform generated and propagated over a flat 
bottom. Using numerical model as described, we calculate the disturbed 
free-surface elevation accordingly. The consistent result with the first-
order theoretical solution, Eq. (12), is shown in Fig. 3. 
     Tanaka et al. (1998) obtained the approximated velocity profiles 
within a laminar boundary layer under cnoidal waves. We compare 
their result with present calculation at a specific location to validate the 
model. Two velocity profiles are compared in Fig. 4 at the instances of 
either a wave crest or a tough just passing by the observed site x = 14.7. 
From the asymmetric wave profile shown in Fig. 3, the near-bed 
velocity has larger value at the crest than at the tough, as shown in Fig. 
4. The values of the depth-averaged velocity (or, correspondingly, the 
free stream velocity near bottom) related to the wave elevation through

instances as the wave crest and tough passed by this position.

Validation of Wave-Induced Velocity Profiles above a Wavy Bed 
We further consider the influence of the wavy bottom on the flow 
motion. For Case D as in Fredsøe’s experiments, the waves first 
propagate along a mild slopping bottom between x = 6 ~ 11, and then 
through 66 ripples on a flat base, as referred to Fig. 5 for part of flow 
domain. We validate the velocity profiles above the ripple crest (at R11) 
at two temporal phases. Fig. 6 shows excellent agreement between the 
present numerical results and experimental data. 
     Although the induced flow by nonlinear waves could be turbulent, it 
is still worthwhile studying the laminar flow in detail because many of 
essential flow features are similarly present and because the laminar 
flow structure will also give some clue toward the development of 
 why the long water wave does not affect by the bottom roughness, nor 
does by the boundary friction in shallow water, under the present flow 
conditions. From Fig. 9, we can also see the vortex patterns are 
significantly different when the wave crest or trough passes through 
ripples. Under the wave, the induced flow near the bottom is positive 
below the elevated water part including the wave crest, that is, the free 
stream for near bottom flow is of the same direction as the wave. 
Oppositely, the reversal flow appears below the depressed water part 
including the trough. The downward or upward flow is at the midpoint of 
zero water elevation between the crest and the trough, as seen the 
downward flow at about x = 15 and the upward at about x = 20 in Fig. 9. 
To observe more detail in the vortical flow, we will consider the vorticity 
distribution for two smaller regions, one region of positive flow and the 
other of reversed flow, both spanning several ripples. 
     We may summarize briefly that the vortex is formed due to flow 
separation on the local downstream side around the crest. The increase in 
flow speed (positive flow in acceleration phase or reverse flow in 
deceleration phase) can not make the separation region growing (like Fig 
8(b)) but the decreasing speed can (like Fig’s 8(f) and 8(g)). As the speed 
is close to zero at zero wave elevation (like Fig’s 8(a) and 8(d)), the 
induced flow by wave may be downward (or upward), depending on the 
crest on its downstream (or upstream) side.  For upward flow (like Fig 
8(a)), the vortex is enforced to shed away from ripple surface and to 
dissipate outward while, for the downward flow (like Fig 8(d)), the 
counter-rotating vortices are pushed sideward as, for example, R10d. 
Since the asymmetric waveform within one period makes the free stream 
outside the bottom boundary layer not to have the same speed during half 
cycle, the vortex patterns is slightly different. It requires longer time 
duration to distinguish from their difference. Using property 2, the spatial 
shift can be transformed approximately to the equivalent temporal shift 
among ripples. We thus use this trick to discuss the temporal effects of 
asymmetric wave motion by means of the spatial shift among ripples, 
using a global flow patterns in a larger flow region.

Fig. 8 Evolved streamlines above wavy bed  
(between R10 and R11) under wave motion 
 
     Fig’s 11(a)(b) illustrates the vorticity distributions of the transported 
vortices around the ripple bottom, beneath the wave crest and beneath 
the trough, respectively, at t = 63.95. Again, following the time 
sequence by using property 2 discussed above, the evolved vorticity 
decays quickly in Fig. 11(a) and grows slowly in Fig 11(b), for delay of 
duration ∆t = 0.36 when crossing over one ripple from the right hand 
side toward the left (from R20 to R16 in Fig. 11(a), and from R7 to R4 
in Fig. 11(b), respectively). Since the elevated part of waveform is 
higher and shaper than the depressed part, the flow pattern differs from 
each other. 
     As a periodic wave propagates over a flat bed, the horizontal 
velocity will increase rapidly from zero on the bottom to the free stream 
velocity within a thin oscillatory (Stokes) layer of thickness of order of 
T . For nonlinear long wave (such as cnoidal wave in this case) 
propagates over the ripple bottom, the Stokes layer is thicker and 
weaker because of its large value of T. Thus, the near-wall flow 
becomes complicated mainly from separated flow motion, but less from 
its interaction with Stokes layer among ripples. We take four sections at 
x = 14.76 (the crest of R10), 14.80, 14.96 and 15.12 to plot their

CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this study, we present a two-dimensional model for viscous flow to 
simulate the generation and propagation of cnoidal waves over a ripple 
bottom, and analyzed the induced flow interacting with a wavy bed. 
The transient boundary-conforming grid with FA discretization and 
other numerical techniques was applied in the model to treat flow 
problems involving nonlinear free surface and irregular solid surface.  
A piston-type wave-maker was adopted to generate such cnoidal waves 
in the flow domain. The model was then validated by two flow cases. 
First in the flat-bed case, the calculated water elevations and the 
velocity profiles agreed well with the analytical solutions of the first-
order cnoidal wave theory. For the ripple-bed case, the numerical result 
was also verified to be consistent well with experimental data by 
previous investigation. 
     The near-bottom flow over a wavy bed always separates to generate 
interesting vortical flow patterns as the cnoidal wave propagates over 
the ripples. With different phases of wave motion, these transported 
vortices can grow and then be convected, diffused outward and 
dissipated finally around the ripples by the wave-induced flow. The 
flow velocity affected by the vortex evolution can be further applied for 
tracing fluid particles to analyze sediment transport among ripples. The 
trajectories of flow particles never closed themselves during wave 
periods. These particles moving to and fro with wide range of 
trajectories around the ripples also depend on their proximity from the 
ripple bottom. This study will give much useful information for 
engineering practice.

In the present study, a two-dimensional general flow model is 
developed to investigate particular flow features induced by the cnoidal 
wave over a wavy bed. This laminar flow model based on stream 
function-vorticity formulation is discretized by the finite analytic (FA) 
method. The fully nonlinear free-surface conditions are treated 
accurately in a boundary-fitted grid system for best computational 
economics. Numerical solutions obtained from this model have been 
validated in comparison with available theoretical solutions or 
experimental data for the flat bed and the wavy bed in our previous 
work (Lee and Tang, 2009). Here, we will focus on the phenomena 
related to Bragg resonances. 
 
BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF NUMERICAL MODEL 
 
The flow is assumed two dimensional (2D), viscous and incompressible. 
The model is formulated conveniently by solving streamfunction () 
and vorticity (), instead of pressure and velocity vector, in the Navier-
Stokes model. In a general curvilinear coordinate system (ξ, η; τ), 
dimensionless forms (as referred to undisturbed water depth h, linear 
wave velocity gh  and transport time /h g  for g the gravitational 
constant) of the governing equations are 
2    , 2 / ReU V           (1, 2) 
where Re /h gh   is the Reynolds number and  is the kinematic 
viscosity of fluid. Here the subscripts in coordinates and time denote 
their differentiations. For (ξ, η; τ)=( ξi; τ) for i =1, 2, the Laplacian is  
2 ( ) /j ij jJg J     , for , 1 or 2i j  , (3) 
with Einstein’s summation for repeated indices in i and j, and (U ,V ) 
in (2) is the contra-variant convective velocity relative to the grid node

The contravariant metric tensors ijg  and Jacobian of transformation J  
are defined as in differential geometry. To ensure the unique 
transformation we request the non-vanishing Jacobian in the flow field. 
 
Initial and Boundary Conditions 
Cnoidal waves are generated by a moving piston wavemaker from rest 
at far upstream, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We take a large enough distance 
to setup a rigid wavy bed to keep from the wave reflection from the 
wavemaker. The flow domain is within 1 ≤ ξ ≤ ξmax, and 1 ≤ η ≤ ηmax 
which maps respectively to X(τ) ≤ x ≤ Xmax and yb(ξ)  ≤ y  ≤  ζ(ξ; τ).

 and wavelength L = 14.04 passing over the even or ripple bottoms. The 
Ursell number of the incident cnoidal wave is thus 
Ur = HL2 / (h3(2π)2) = 0.998, 
approximately satisfying the weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive, 
permanent long-wave condition of Ur = 1 (Ursell, 1953). These 
incident waves will be applied in all flowing analyses. Three ripple 
bottoms of different spacing are used. Two of them are of nearly 
resonant spacing, say, the first L = 2.06Lr and the second  L = 4.12Lr, 
which are close, but with a little downshift deviation, to the ideal Bragg 
resonant spacing, i.e., L = mLr for m an integer, while the third ripple 
bottom is not of resonant spacing L = 2.55Lr. Mei et al. (2005) 
discussed such downshift of Bragg resonance appearing in Davies and 
Heathershaw’s experiment due to the nonlinear effects. Nevertheless, 
we merely take a slight downshift deviation from the ideal resonance 
condition to match their experiment. In all three ripple bottoms, there 
are totally ten ripples of equal spacing set in the ranges begins at x = 
136. We plot the interferential patterns in the x-t plane in Fig. 5-7(a), 
respectively, for these three ripple bottoms. The gray-level colors in 
illustration are used with heavier blue for the higher wave elevation 
until the lowest elevation with the white. Therefore, the blue lines 
crossing from the bottom left to top right in the figure are the crest lines 
of the incident cnoidal waves, the relative lighter blue lines in the other 
direction are the crest lines of Bragg reflected waves. We also observe 
the intersection points of heaviest blue and white giving crests and 
toughs of constructive interference at antinodes, respectively. It 
becomes significantly interfered for all Bragg waves reflected from 
ripples to reach the upstream edge of ripple bed as time increases over 
200 units. To make more detailed view of these patterns, we enlarge 
those small areas with plotted contours and show them in Fig. 5-7(b), 
respectively, for comparison. Meanwhile, we also plot the evolved free-
surface elevations during Bragg resonance over the first ripple bottom 
at the upstream edge of ripples, x = 137 (wave gage G1), are shown in 
Fig. 8. For reference, the dot line represents for the evolved wave 
elevations over the even bottom without ripples. As seen clearly in this 
figure, when t > 200, the wave profile reflected from all ripples begins 
to grow its amplitude and gradually approaches to the quasi-steady state 
around t = 300. The evolutions of free-surface elevations for both the 
even bottom and the first ripple bottom are best described by the phase 
plot in Fig. 9. The starting points at the origin represented for the initial 
rest state of mean free surface.

 interior flow field, by two subplots, one the streamline contour as the 
upper subplot and the other equip-vorticity line contour as the lower. 
Fig 16 illustrates two sets of the interior flow field for waves past the 
first ripple bottom. The first set is at the instant t = 175.1 before the 
occurrence of Bragg resonance while the other set is at t = 318.1 after 
that. Although the vorticity on the ripple is diffused and separated from 
the solid surface, the viscous region remains thin in all flow fields. 
Some particular features are unusual by the action from Bragg 
resonance, for example, the development of standing wave in Fig. 11 (b) 
is seen. However, the dividing streamlines illustrate that the crests are 
not antinodes since the Bragg reflected wave are somehow weaker than

bottom before Bragg reflection. 
 
The effects of ripple height on the Bragg resonant reflection are another 
interesting issue worthy to be studied. Fig 12 plots the spatial 
distribution of steady wave heights for waves passing over various 
ripple heights, namely, Hr / h = 0.025, 0.05, 0.15 and 0.1,. From these 
curves, we found the steady wave height of reflection increases with the 
ripple height. The accumulation of ripple reflection leads to the largest 
wave height at the first ripple with the weakest wave height at the last 
one. The varied height of ripple does not change the distribution but 
only amplification in magnitude. Due to the impartation of reflection 
energy, the transmitted wave becomes weaker over higher ripples. 
These are all the exact features of Bragg resonance. If the wavelength is 
away from the resonant condition such as L / Lr = 2.55, a very weak 
resonance still occurs, as seen in Fig. 13. As discussed before, the board 
spectrum of incident cnoidal wave make this reflection, even rather 
weak, to be possible.

ABSTRACT 
 
The article presents the numerical study on the Bragg resonances of the 
cnoidal wave with rigid ripples on a mean flat bottom. With the 
application of a general laminar flow model for nonlinear wave 
problems (Lee and Tang, 2009), we are able to study the possible 
strong reflection of the cnoidal wave from rigid ripples with certain 
tuned spacing around the condition of Bragg resonances. In this study, 
we consider the weakly-nonlinear, weakly-dispersive, cnoidal waves 
under the viscous action of the periodic finite-amplitude ripples. The 
competing orders of magnitude among effects of wave nonlinearity and 
dispersion on the slowly evolving free surface, viscosity on the induced 
vortical flow near the uneven bottom, and the tuned ripple spacing on 
reflected wave-seabed resonances all together makes complicated 
interaction between the free surface and the ripple bottom. Besides the 
usual description of the transmitted and reflected wave energy in 
Fourier domain, we also employ the phase plot in nonlinear dynamic 
theory to describe the qualitative nature of wave interaction. The 
detailed interferential pattern obtained from the intersected crest-lines 
of the incident and reflected waves is illustrated clearly during Bragg 
resonances.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Seabed is rarely flat in nature. As stated by Dolan (1983), nearly 
periodic longshore sandbars can be found on north American beaches, 
such as in Shespapeake Bay (Kindle, 1936; Dolan, 1983), in Lake 
Michigan (Evans, 1940; Saylor and Hands, 1970), in Escambia Bay, 
Florida (Lau & Travis, 1973), on the southern California coast 
(Sheppard, 1950), in the Alaskan Arctic (Short, 1975), etc. Sandbars 
have many essential effects on the wave climate and coastal 
morphodynamics. Relating to mass transport on a flat mean bottom 
with sand ripples, Carter et al. (1973) have studied the partial standing 
waves under critical reflection coefficient for the Lagrangian drift. Mei 
(1985) investigated the Bragg Resonant reflection of water waves 
scattering by periodic sandbars. Based on the small amplitude wave 
theory, he used the multiple-scale perturbation method to analyze the 
uniformly-valid solution for two coupled equations of evolved wave 
amplitude of the incident and the reflected waves under Bragg resonant 
condition. Hara and Mei (1987) extended the multiple-scale method to 
higher orders to analyze the Bragg scattering for slight detuning from 
perfect resonances. They found the existence of cutoff detuning 
frequency, the dispersive nature of the first-order wave envelope, and 
the radiation of second-order long waves. The resonant condition was 
obtained from the transport equations of wave actions when the slowly-
evolved amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves are coupled 
with the ripple height as sinusoidal modulation (Mei et al., 2005). 
Another way to view the mechanism for Bragg resonances can be 
analogous to the resonant interactions of nonlinear waves only on the 
free surface, as suggested by Davis and Heathershaw (1984). Therefore, 
the general resonant conditions for nonlinear wave interactions without 
ripple bottom (e.g. Phillips, 1960) can deduce the Bragg condition as 
well. Thus, the Bragg resonant conditions are thus obtained by taking 
the zero sum of all wave numbers of water waves and ripples, and, 
respectively, by the zero sum of all wave frequencies with zero value 
for ripple frequency. Note that all these studies as mentioned above 
determine the Bragg resonant conditions through combining discrete 
components of linear sinusoidal waves. In all, the higher-order 
evolution equations build up those non-homogeneous resonant or 
secular terms from nonlinear coupling between the lower-order incident 
and reflected waves with specific ripples of tuned spacing. For example, 
the bottom ripples of periodic spacing as one half the wavelength of an 
incident sinusoidal wave is the simplest one to fit the Bragg resonant 
condition. Other integral ratios of wavelength to the ripple spacing can 
as well result in the Bragg resonance. 
 
Cnoidal wave contains non-ignorable effects of nonlinearity in addition 
to those of wave dispersion already included in linear wave theory. 
Even for the first-order cnoidal wave theory it can describe such 
nonlinear effects to some extent, whereas the linear wave theory cannot 
(Isobe, 1985). In this respect, the cnoidal wave theory might be more 
suitable to describe near bottom characteristics and sediment transport 
in nearshore current. However, due to mathematic complexity related to 
the cnoidal wave theory, there are relatively few studies on boundary 
layer flow under the motion of cnoidal waves. For nonlinear non-
harmonic waves like cnoidal waves passing over the ripple bottom in 
this study, the continuous broad-banded spectrum of incident 
wavelength makes the bottom scattering easier to fit the Bragg resonant 
conditions if the wavelength content within this incident-wave 
spectrum covers the integral times of ripple spacing. This can be clearly 
seen in the numerical result. 
 Grid Generation 
The present study applies a transient grid system in the flow domain to 
conform to all moving and fixed boundaries of irregular or regular 
shape. To save our computing time and preserve solution’s accuracy, 
we generate the grid, with certain gridlines being stationary but others 
in movement, all by algebraic method. For simplicity, a fixed number 
of gridlines are distributed in the flow domain so that the algebraic 
functions are utilized to designate the unique locations of grid nodes. 
Better enough, those algebraic functions for gird construction can be 
differentiated directly to calculate the geometric coefficients 
analytically. 
 
Since the water surface with wave on it and the moving waveplate of 
the wavemaker are two moving boundaries of either irregular or plane 
shape, the numerical grid needs updating at every time step during 
computation. On the other hand, the ripple bottom is highly irregular 
but stationary, whose grid is necessarily specified only at initial stage. 
After making gridlines conforming to the initial boundary, the upper 
part of ξ-　lines moves non-uniformly with the deformable free surface, 
and the lower part, including ripple bottom region, is kept fixed. 
Similarly, we allow the upstream part of η-lines to move with 
waveplate, uniformly but elastically, and fix the downstream part, also 
including the ripple region. Therefore, grid near the ripple bed region is 
always stationary and fitted with ripples there. Moreover, to resolve the 
thin boundary layer near bottom surface, the grid space is especially 
fine in this region, as shown in Fig. 2. Because this fine grid is fixed 
intentionally, no extra effort is required to update the grid location later 
on. This strategy improves greatly the accuracy of solution without 
penalty of computing time. In the present study, we carry out an 
iterative process with continuous local refinement of gridlines close to 
the bottom until the grid-independent solution is sought.

Discretization and Solution Procedure 
The flow equations, Eq. (1) and (2) are discretized by the finite analytic 
(FA) method (see Chen and Chen (1982), Chang (1997) or Tang and 
Chang (2002) for detail). This method is based on the local analytic 
solution of linearized convective-diffusive transport equation. The 
nonlinear instability caused by convection is avoided by using this 
discretization method. Such treatment should expectedly yield an 
algebraic form in better physical senses than other discretization 
schemes. Besides the interior equations, another difficulty appears on 
the free surface. The free-surface dynamic condition is nonlinear and 
coupled with a prior unknown location of the free surface, which ought 
to be determined together with kinematic condition. The free-surface 
conditions are discretized by using two-level time-averaged, central 
differences in   and time derivatives, and backward differences in 
 derivatives. This gives a stable and accurate scheme, as illustrated by 
Tang and Chang (1997, 1998 and 2002). In all, the discrete algebraic 
expression for all equations and the associated boundary conditions are 
solved iteratively by tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) with line-
by-line successive over-relaxation (LSOR). By means of fully iteration 
until the converged solutions are obtained, all equations and boundary 
conditions are satisfied at every time step. Using this procedure, we 
thus declare our present solution grid-independent and time-accurate. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Validation of the Numerical Model 
Davies and Heathershaw (1984) carried out the experiment to study the 
propagation of finite-amplitude waves over sinusoidal topography in 
the laboratory. They considered the incident wave of wave height H* = 
3cm (H = H*/h = 0.1) and period T* = 1.31s (T = T* / (h/g)1/2 = 7.28) 
with wavelength of L* = 1m in the mean water depth of h = 31.3cm. 
Ten ripples of 10cm high was chosen under the Bragg resonant 
condition of ratio of ripple spacing and the wavelength, i.e., Lr/L = 0.5. 
This is the flow case the most commonly discussed in the Bragg 
resonant reflection coefficients by almost all investigators. However, it 
is seldom seen in the published articles for any detailed wave profile 
distributed spatially across the ripple bed during Bragg resonant 
reflection. Undoubtedly, this kind of information is important to predict 
the wave climate around the ripple bed for practical purpose. Mase et al. 
(1995) extended a time-dependent mild-wave equation developed by 
Kirby (1986) to model waves propagating over permeable rippled bed. 
They have ever calculated the spatial distribution of steady wave 
heights over an impermeable or permeable ripple bed for the flow 
condition very closed to Davies and Hearhershaw’s setup parameters. 
Here one still defines the steady wave height H as the height difference 
between the maximum and the minimum water-surface elevations for 
quasi-steady wave passing a specific location whether the wave is 
interfered by Bragg reflections. We attempt to compare their result for 
waves reflected over the impermeable ripple bed with our - model. 
To this end, the numerical grid applied in our model is partially shown 
in Fig. 3, which sets the 10 ripples of sinusoidal bed between 
x  107.84 and 139.84. In addition, we estimate the value of Re ≒ 5×
105 in application to our viscous model, according to Davies and 
Hearhershaw’s setup condition., the spatial distribution of steady wave 
heights H/H0 (for Ho as the wave height on an even bottom) is 
compared in Fig. 4 which demonstrates the excellent agreement 
between both results. This validates our flow model is applicable, 
although roughly in no further detail but at least with the accuracy 
compatible to the wave model in use.

Fig. 8 Evolved free-surface elevations at x=137 (G1) (sinusoidal bottom 
with L / Lr = 2.06). 
 
The evolution of free surface with time is best described by the phase 
plot which is constructed by use of the free-surface elevation and its 
velocity at a specific location, as shown in Fig. 9 for the location x = 
137 (G1), one for the even bottom and the other for the first ripple 
bottom. We can easily observe many essential features in these two 
phase plots during the wave evolving process. First of all, the fact that 
each line starts from the origin represents for the free surface always 
moving from its initial rest state at mean free surface. Until some time 
later (say, t = 130 in Fig. 8), the leading wave gets into the observed 
location G1 while the phase line begins to rise up and down with 
positive or negative velocity around a circular path in the figure. At 
specific vertical displacement, the acceleration can also be observed 
through its slope. The plot thus gives us a complete picture of free 
surface motion on a kinematic viewpoint. Secondly, both two phase 
lines are not symmetric vertically due to the nonlinear cnoidal 
waveform, while only the right phase lines is asymmetric horizontally 
due to Bragg resonant reflection. From the left plot, the non-reflected 
waves (on a flat bottom) grow after two rounds to its final steady state 
by repeating its closed path (as a limit cycle) with slight modulation in 
overlap region. This modulation can be explained plausibly by the 
reason that the cnoidal wave is not perfectly generated to a permanent 
form owing to either the defected low-order wave generation in use, or 
the induced numerical errors causes this small oscillation or both. 
Furthermore, we find out on the right plot several particular features 
uniquely attributed to the Bragg reflection, which is greatly 
distinguished from the left plot without reflection. The trend in 
amplitude growth is clearly at non-uniform rate due to the nonlinear 
accumulating effects during Bragg resonant refection from those ripples 
as the cnoidal waves passing over them. The nonlinearity through the 
second-order coupling of incident and reflected wave amplitudes has 
been formulated by the multiple-scale method (e.g., Mei, 1985). The 
qualitative behavior in dynamic view is therefore shown through these 
phase plots. To see more detail in response to the surface wave motion 
from internal fluid, we need to study the flow motion beneath the wave.

To see the detail of how the reflected waves evolved in the region of 
the ripple region, we take three locations, namely, x = 142.4 (G2), 
146.1 (G3) and 202 (G4) marked in Fig. 12, to observe the wave 
elevation. These are done at G2, G3 and G4, respectively, in Fig 12(a). 
As expected. the evolved wave at G4 are rapidly gets to the steady state 
because there is no reflection and all are transmitted wave. The 
resonance weakens the amplitude of this transmitted wave. The wave 
modulation at G3 is clearly found and the evolved wave at this site 
tends to develop slowly the steady state of weak wave height. On the 
contrast, the evolved wave height at G2 is kept amplified during 
developing its steady state.

SUMMARY 
 
In this study, we applied a two-dimensional viscous-flow model to 
investigate Bragg resonant interaction between the incident cnoidal 
wave and the ripple bottom. We analyzed the evolved wave and its 
flow field during resonance. The interferential patterns were presented 
whether under Bragg resonant conditions. Since the board spectrum of 
cnoidal wave, there is still some weak reflected wave occurring even 
for those not satisfying the resonant conditions. The interior flow field 
in this study had thin viscous effects on the sinusoidal bottom due to its 
geometric smoothness in our test cases. The detailed free-surface 
evolution in the ripple region were also studied in the manuscript.
