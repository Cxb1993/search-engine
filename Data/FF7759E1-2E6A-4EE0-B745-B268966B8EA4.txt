metal materials[18-22]. The tribological behavior of a-C:Me coatings is dependent on 
their composition and structure. The a-C:Me coating which provides the optimal 
performance in one particular application is not necessarily the most appropriate 
coating for another application. Therefore, it is essential that the tribological behavior 
of a-C:Me coatings under different operating conditions is fully understood.  
  Using a medium frequency twin magnetron sputtering and unbalanced magnetron 
sputtering system, this study deposits a-C:Tix%, a-C:W x% and a-C:Zr x% coatings with 
various levels of Ti, W and Zr addition are deposited on cemented tungsten carbide 
(WC-Co) substrates. The coated are tested against AISI 1045 steel counterbody to 
establish the optimal a-C:Tix% coating for tribological properties.  
 
2. Experimental details 
2.1. Specimen preparation  
The cylinders used as the upper specimens (counterbodies) in the wear tester were 
AISI 1045 steel (Hv 286, 50g), cut off directly from round as-purchased stock and then 
mechanically polished to a roughness of Ra ≈ 0.32µm. Meanwhile, the lower 
specimens, used as the coating substrates, were cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) 
disks, whose surfaces were mechanically polished to Ra ≈ 0.008µm.   
 
2.2. Tribology tests  
The tribological properties of the various coatings were evaluated using a 
Schwingung Reibung Verschleib (SRV) oscillation friction and wear tester (Optimol, 
Germany) Fig.1 presents a schematic diagram of the experimental setup and indicates 
the dimensions of the upper and lower test specimens. The arrangement of a cylinder 
mating with a disk forms a cylinder-on-disk line contact wear mode. The wear tests 
were performed at room temperature under atmospheric pressure. The relative humidity 
 2
(a-C:Ti51% ) have the lowest and the highest hardness values, i.e. 812 Kgf/mm2 and 
1345 Kgf/mm2, respectively. For a-C:W x%, the coating hardness decreases as the W 
content is increased from 8.8 at.% to 18.8 at.% (coatings W2, W3 and W4). However, 
the hardness then increases as the W content is further increased from 18.8 at.% to 
25at.% (coatings W5 and W6). Coatings a-C:W4.6% (W1) and a-C:W25% (W6) have the 
lowest and the highest hardness values, i.e. 843 Kgf/mm2 and 1385 Kgf/mm2, 
respectively.  
For a-C:Zr x%. The coating hardness decreases as the Zr content is increased from 
0 at.% to 16.3 at.% (coatings Z0 – Z4). However, the hardness then increases as the Zr 
content is increased from 25.4 at.% to 45.1at.% (coatings Z5 – Z9), but the further 
addition of Zr leads to a reduction in hardness. Hence, the: a-C: Zr48% coating (Z10) 
exhibits lower hardness than a-C: Zr45% coating (Z9). Coatings Z4 (a-Zr16% ) and Z9 
(a-C: Zr 45% ) have the lowest and the highest hardness values, i.e. 1325.6 Kgf/mm2 and 
2960.8 Kgf/mm2, respectively. 
 
3.2 Tribological properties of coatings under wear testing 
The resulting friction coefficient curves comprise two main regions. In the first 
region, the curve is smooth and corresponds to low friction coefficients with an average 
value designated as µa In the second region, the curve fluctuates and corresponds to 
high friction coefficients with an average value of µb. The lifetime (L) of the coating is 
defined as the duration of the first region, i.e. L Table 4-6 presents the wear depths, 
mean values of the friction coefficients and lifetime (L) of the current coatings obtained 
after wear testing for 24 minutes against an AISI 1045 steel counterbody.  
Table 4 shows that coatings a-C:Ti3%, a-C:Ti13% and a-C:Ti20% (T1-T3) have good 
tribological properties, i.e. they have a low friction coefficient and a low wear depth. At 
a loading of 100 N, the friction coefficients µa varies between 0.12 and 0.20, and a long 
 4
have good tribological properties, i.e. they have a low friction coefficient, a low wear 
depth and a long lifetime under loadings 100N. The friction coefficients i.e. µa varies 
between 0.13 and 0.34, and a long lifetime is still achieved, i.e. between 858 and 1199 
seconds. Coatings Z1-Z4 also have good anti-wear properties with wear depths ranging 
from 1.12 to 1.53 µm under a loading of 100 N. Of these four coatings, the a-C:Zr13% 
coating possesses the best tribological properties (i.e. low coefficient of friction: 0.22; 
the lowest wear depth: 1.12 µm ;and the longest lifetime 1199 seconds, respectively). 
Referring to Table 3, it is clear that both wear depths of a-C:Zr13% coating are less than 
the coating thickness under 100N loading. Table 6 shows the coatings Z0 and Z5 
(a-C:Zr0% and a-C:Zr25%) have a higher wear depth than coatings Z1-Z4, and their 
lifetimes are reduced to less than 629 seconds. Finally, coatings Z6-Z10 (i.e. a-C:Zrx% 
coatings with Zr additions of x=33%, x=37%, x=41%, x=45% and x=48%, respectively) 
exhibit the poorest tribological properties of all the current coatings. When a normal 
load of 100 N is applied, the wear depth ranges from 3.2-3.88 µm and hence the wear 
scars actually penetrate the substrate. In addition, the friction coefficients of these five 
coatings range from 0.4 to 0.66 (µa) under a loading of 100N. Finally, the lifetimes of 
these coatings are all very short, i.e. L < 217 seconds  
 
4. Conclusions 
This study has shown that a-C:Tix%, a-C:W x% and a-C:Zr x% coatings with varying 
levels of Ti, W and Zr metal produces different tribological properties. The enhanced 
tribological properties obtained by doping the a-C:Tix%, a-C:Wx% and a-C:Zrx% coatings 
with appropriate levels of Ti, W and Zr metal include a low friction coefficient, a low 
coating wear depth and a long lifetime. The present results have demonstrated that the 
a-C:Ti13%, a-C:W8.8% and a-C:Zr13%coatings provides the  optimal tribological 
performance.
