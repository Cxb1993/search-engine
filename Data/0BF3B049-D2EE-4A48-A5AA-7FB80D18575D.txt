前言 
近年來，隨著電子產品朝向高性能、多功能、小型化、薄型化、攜帶型化等的方
向發展，在上述的背景之下，使得 IC 電子構裝技術逐漸由原本二維型構裝朝向
三維型的高密度電子構裝的趨勢發展，為逹此目的，系統構裝 (system in  
package, SiP)之技術因而開發出來，此一技術是將各類元件、介質層、佈線以
及大規模積體電路(Large Scale integration, LSI)、大型積體電路(Very Large 
Scale Integration, VLSI) 與專用積體電路 (Application Specific Integrated 
Circuint, ASIC)等統一集成於一個電子構裝統之內，它具有龐大的『系統』功能，
將原來的三個構裝層次包括一級晶片、二級 PCB 板構裝、三級母板構裝，合併
成僅一個構裝層次。此舉就能夠將電子構裝密度提到最高，使系統的功能越強、
性能越好、重量越輕、體積越小、可靠性越高、成本卻相對更低。目前 SiP 朝向
『系統多層構裝』方面發展，接腫而來是對應多引腳、高速化的微互連技術中所

研究方法 
實驗設計： 
本實驗設計採用 Montgomery 中的 25-1部份因子設計，並利用 Design Expert 7
軟體進行變異數分析(Analysis Of Variance, ANOVA)且尋找最佳操作條件，首先
我們將針對 VF2、氯離子、硫酸、電流密度、陰極圓周運動轉速等五個因子進行
研究，其各因子之操作條件範圍如表 1 所示。 
哈林槽電鍍實驗： 
將通孔板以 3%H2SO4清洗後，依實驗設計之實驗條件添加添加劑至硫酸銅電鍍
液電鍍槽中，進行電鍍，其電鍍相關條件：電鍍厚鍍固定為 16μm 其電鍍時間依
電流密度不同而定，槽液溫度為 25℃。

濃度梯度存在，銅沈積以蝴蝶式的沈積方式(Butterfly Depostion, BP)，當孔中之
銅沈積至封口後，一通孔成為兩盲孔時，VF2於盲孔之濃度梯度變小，因此當VF2
濃度越高時反而使VF2的濃度梯度變得更小，造成填孔能力變差的原因；其次影
該響填孔能力因子最弱者分別為電流密度、圓周運動速度；在兩因子交互作用部
份主要貢獻度分別為電流密度-圓周運動速度＞硫酸-氯離子＞VF2-氯離子，在電
流密度-圓周運動速度因子部份，由線性廻歸模式的參數中得知為當此一因子越
大時其填孔能力越小，其原因在此部份因子設計上此解析度為5，兩因子與三因

(一般而言三因子的交互作用可忽略)，在電流密度-圓周運動速度因子部份包括
VF2-硫酸-氯離子三因子的交互作用，由電化學分析結果得知VF2-硫酸-氯離子之
間有交互作用存在，因此我們忽略電流密度-圓周運動速度兩因子的交互作用，
因為在此一系統之中電流密度-圓周運動速度交互作用貢獻度應小於VF2-硫酸-
氯離子交互作用，由電化學分析結果得知，VF2會受到硫酸-氯離子濃度提高而
增加抑制銅沈積的能力，此一結果與VF2主因子效應相同，抑制能力越強是有助
於蝴蝶式的沈積方式但不利於孔底上移的沈積，因此才會造成填孔能力的下降；
在硫酸-氯離子部份與電化學行為之實驗結果亦不符合，當氯離子-硫酸濃度越高
時VF2之抑制銅沈積能力越強，由線性廻歸模式的參數中，可進一步的證實氯離
子-硫酸濃度越高時填孔能力越差，表示抑制沈積能力越強與填孔能力並無線性
之關係；VF2-氯離子因子部份亦與電化學行為之實驗結果相符，當VF2-氯離子
越高時抑制銅沈積能力越強，由線性廻歸模式的參數中，亦可證實VF2-氯離子

由ANOVA分析結果得知，影響孔徑為140μm填孔能力之主要因子分別為氯離子

The development of high density interconnects (HDI) for IC 
packaging substrate and printed circuit board (PCB) will be a key 
technology for fabrication of consumer electronic products in the 
next generation. To meet these demands and requirements of state-
of-the-art microelectronic products, both microvias and through 
holes (THs) will need to be completely metallized; preferably in a 
void-free manner. Unfortunately current copper electroplating 
technology that is used for filling microvias cannot provide void-
free filling of through holes. In this work, a novel copper 
electroplating formula is developed that achieves through hole 
filling while employing DC plating. In addition, this new plating 
formula simultaneously achieves the filling of microvias and 
through hole in a single step, thereby simplifying the overall 
fabrication process. 
 
Introduction 
 
High density interconnects (HDI) among dielectric layers have been widely 
employed in fabrication of state-of-the-art printed circuit boards (PCBs) in order to meet 
the requirements of portable and foldable consumer electronic products. Also, advanced 
IC substrates need HDI in order to meet the high I/O counts of advanced IC chips.(1,2) 
Currently, microvias, which are commonly formed by laser drilling, are responsible for 
the interconnection of IC substrate and PCB. One microvia located in a dielectric layer is 
able to connect two conducting lines that are individually located up and down the 
dielectric layer. On the other hand, one TH, which is usually located within a core layer, 
is able to connect many conducting lines, depending on the pattern design and layer 
counts.(1,2) 
With the development of advanced IC chips, 65 nm, even 45 nm, processes are 
being moved into mass production. The copper metallization process has become the 
main technology for interconnect fabrication of such advanced IC devices. (3,4) 
Correspondingly, the contact area of conducting point between the advanced IC chip and 
the IC packaging substrate must become smaller and smaller because of the high I/O 
counts. Consequently, the diameter of microvias on advanced IC substrates located at the 
most outer layer have been shrunk to be dimensions in the range of 25 ~ 50 µm. At this 
length scale the microvias have to be fully filled with copper as opposed to the traditional 
approach involving sidewall metallization only. Otherwise, the electric resistance of the 
microvia will exceed the desired specification. 
Microvias can be fully filled by copper electroplating technology in a mode of 
bottom-up filling, whereby the fastest copper deposition rate occurs at the bottom of the 
microvias during plating. So far, to cause the bottom-up fill of microvias, some specific

copper plating and subsequently deposited by copper electroplating in order to increase 
the thickness of the copper seed layer to 2 ~ 3 µm before filling plating was conducted. 
Two phosphorus-containing copper plates were used as anodes and directly placed in the 
plating bath with a working volume of 1500 mL. The plating bath has been detailed 
elsewhere.(7) 
The composition of the base electrolyte used for all plating tests was 0.88 M 
CuSO4·5H2O (Riedel-de Haën, ACS), 0.54 M H2SO4 (Merck, 96%, Ultrapure). The other 
additives, such as SPS (Raschig GmbH, Germany), strong suppressor (SS), polyethylene 
glycol (PEG) with a molecular weight of 8000 (Fluka), and Cl– (NaCl, Fisher, Certified 
ACS) were individually added to the plating bath through dilution from stock solutions 
that were prepared using the appropriate concentrations of these additives. The 
temperature of the plating solution was maintained at 28oC. The filling performance was 
assessed from cross-sections of the microvias and THs that were examined using an 
optical microscope (OM) (Olympus BX51). 
The electrochemical behavior of additive was characterized with cyclic linear sweep 
voltammetry (CLSV) using different rotation speeds of the working electrode (WE). All 
CLSV measurements were performed in a glass vessel containing 100 mL of electrolyte 
solution and using a PGSTAT30 (Auto-Lab) potentiostat with a three-electrode cell. A 
platinum rotating disk electrode (Pt-RDE) with a diameter of 3 mm was employed as the 
WE. The counter electrode (CE) was a small copper bar, which was placed in a small 
glass tube that contained a blank electrolyte (i.e., 0.88 M CuSO4·5H2O + 0.54 M H2SO4). 
The end-side of the small glass tube was sealed with a porous polymer material to 
prevent the additives from directly contacting the CE during analysis, which might in turn 
yield unfavorable byproducts. A saturated mercury-mercurous sulfate electrode (SMSE) 
served as the reference electrode (RE). The CLSV was carried out by a negative-going 
sweep from open circuit potential (OCP) to -0.7 V vs. SMSE, followed by a positive-
going sweep from -0.7 V vs. SMSE to OCP. The temperature of the electrolyte was 
maintained at 28oC during the electrochemical analysis. Millipore Direct-Q DI water 
(18.2 MΩ cm) was used to make all solutions that were used in the electrochemical 
analysis. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
It is well-known that the adsorption of chloride ion on the copper surface is 
potential-dependent.(17-20) In addition, this behavior of potential-dependent adsorption 
(PDA) of chloride ion is dependent on its bulk solution concentration.(17-20) When the 
chloride ion concentration is lower 20 ppm, the PDA behavior is characterized by 
chloride ion desorption from the copper surface as long as cathodic overpotential is 
higher than a specific value. This behavior is attributed to the counter effect between the 
repulsion of ionic negative charge and the strong electronegativity of chlorine. Once the 
chloride ion concentration is higher than 20 ppm, CuCl will easily form on the copper 
surface. Therefore, the PDA behavior will correspondingly disappear. 
Also, it is well-known that the adsorption of PEG on copper surface is strongly 
related to the adsorption of chloride ion.(19) The adsorption mechanism of PEG-Cl on 
copper surface had been proposed according to a SERS analysis.(19) The scheme of 
PEG-Cl adsorption on copper surface is illustrated in Fig. 1a. According to the SERS 
analysis, the adsorption of PEG needs the participation of Cu+ and Cl–, where Cl– plays 
an anchor to attach the PEG onto copper surface and Cu+ plays a bridge to link the PEG 
and Cl– together. Evidently, the surface coverage of chloride ion on copper surface is

copper deposition rate occurring at the bottom of the microvia was much faster than that 
occurring on the board surface. 
For TH filling, a similar concept is utilized, as shown in Fig. 5. If the surface 
coverage of chloride ion decreases in the sequence of θ1 > θ 2 > θ 3, as shown in Fig. 5a, it 
is expected that the shape of copper deposit deposited at the hole center will be like a 
butterfly wing, as shown Fig. 5b. This means that there is an overpotential gradient that 
gradually decreases from the hole center to the hole opening, which results in a surface 
coverage gradient of chloride ion that correspondingly gradually increases from the hole 
center to the hole opening. Two key factors that may cause the butterfly wing-like copper 
deposit are PDA behavior and forced convection. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully 
control the fluid motion and chloride ion concentration during plating. 
Figure 6 confirmed the desired plating result, indicating that the proposed 
mechanism is feasible and correct. A butterfly wing-like copper deposit was formed at 
the hole center in the beginning of plating. This means that SS is able to strongly 
suppress the copper deposition on the hole opening, but unable to effectively suppress the 
copper deposition at the hole center. The boundary of the butterfly wing represents the 
concentration profile of chloride ion during plating. It is interesting that PEG-Cl system 
cannot do this. Therefore, it is believed that the breakdown of SS should also play a key 
factor for TH filling. 
A comparative experiment of TH filling was carried out using ACF and AFF and 
showed in Fig. 7. Evidently, ACF always results in a void or seam at the hole center after 
electroplating, whereas AFF is able to fully fill the TH. The main failed reason of ACF is 
attributed to the accelerating effect of accelerator, where strongly acts on the board 
surface and thus induces the faradic current to preferentially work on the board surface. 
 
Conclusions 
 
1. System in package (SIP) will be the main stream in the next generation. 
2. Not only microvias but also through holes (THs) need to be fully filled by copper 
electroplating for HDI fabrication, especially for 3D packaging. 
3. Accelerator-containing formula (ACF) can be used for microvia filling only. 
4. Simultaneous fill of microvia and through hole can be carried out by using the 
accelerator-free formula (AFF). 
5. Chloride plays a key role in both ACF and AFF.
