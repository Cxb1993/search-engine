一、前言 
當電子元件的特徵尺寸逐年縮小情形下，熱電製冷器(thermoelectric cooler)是很好的冷卻及溫控設
備，因其具有體積小、可靠度高、維護性高等優點；此外，面對日趨嚴重的地球溫室效應，利用熱電
效應來進行廢熱回收是一減緩溫室效應之可行方法。然而，受限於材料的熱電性質，傳統的熱電元件
之熱效率甚差，所以仍未廣泛的應用。熱電材料之效率可由 2Z S k 值表示，其中S為賽貝克係數
(Seebeck coefficient)， 為導電係數(electric conductivity)，k為熱傳導係數(thermal conductivity)[1]。由
此可知，好的熱電材料需具有高導電性與低導熱性，這與一般所認知的材料特性迥然不同。而傳統的
熱電材料在室溫T=300K下，其ZT值約在約0.6~1.0之間，若ZT值能達到3以上，則其應用層面將更為廣
泛[2,3-6]。 
近年來拜奈米科技的突破，在一些實驗[5,7-19]及理論研究[20-31]中均發現奈米尺度下的半導體材
料，如奈米薄膜(thin film)、奈米管(nanowire)、超晶格(superlattice)結構、奈米複合材料(nanocomposite)
等，皆能使熱電效率有所提升。而改善的原因，定性上主要是因為材料的特徵尺寸縮小會造成聲子色
散關係(phonon dispersion relation)改變，以及增加聲子與邊界(或介面)散射，進而使得材料之晶格熱傳
導係數驟降；其次是奈米結構也具有過濾高能量電子之功能，幫助了賽貝克係數的增加。因此，大量
的文獻將研究重點放在奈米結構下的熱傳行為上。從理論分析的角度來看，由於半導體材料中，聲子
為熱能傳遞的主要載子，所以研究多以波茲曼傳輸方程式(BTE)和單一鬆弛時間近似法(SMRT)為基礎
來建構聲子熱傳之模型。一般考慮的散射機制包括倒逆散射(umklapp process)、質量差異散射、 邊界
散射與聲子-電子散射等等，最後由Matthiessen’s rule將這些散射率累加[15]。從這些理論模型的研究發
現有兩種因素對熱傳導性質影響最大。第一種是因尺寸效應造成聲子色散關係改變，進而導致聲子群
速 (phonon group velocity)下降；第二種則是因產生亂反射之邊界條件改變了非平衡聲子分佈
(non-equilibrium phonon distribution)。Khitun et al. (1999) [16]、 Balandin and Wang et al. (1998) [17]、
Hyldgaard & Mahan (1996) [18]、Walkauskas et al. (1999) [19]、Kiselev et al. (2000) [20]、Zou & Balandin 
(2001) [21]、Chen (1997) [22,23]、以及本計畫主持人[24-26]都曾建立相關理論，詳細分析這兩個因素
對材料等效熱傳導係數之影響。 
 
二、研究目的 
在既有的理論研究中，大多數文獻都是研究幾何形狀較為簡單的材料，並伴隨著一些不盡真實的
假設來推導出物理模型，對於較複雜的奈米結構或晶格結構不完美之材料，理論分析會變得更加困難。
在實驗室中，這些奈米結構材料製造成本極高，不管是物理上欲了解各個重要機制的影響程度，或是
結構設計最佳化，並不是每個實驗室都能負擔得起。有鑑於此，透過數值模擬來研究奈米尺度熱傳特
性成為相當有利之工具。其中因近幾年來電腦運算速度大幅提昇，分子動力學模擬(molecular dynamics,
簡稱MD)在奈米熱傳領域上正逐步發展起來。它的優點在於不需上述理論分析必要的一些假設，在選
定系統中原子之間相互作用的勢能函數以及適當的邊界條件，並給定原子的初始位置與速度後，藉由
牛頓第二運動定律可直接模擬系統隨時間演化之微觀運動行為，最後透過統計方法即可得到巨觀下之
平衡參數與傳輸性質。 
本計畫企圖整合前人的研究結果，截長補短，建立一套符合物理意義且完整的 MD 工具來進行奈米
尺度或奈米結構下的熱傳模擬；將 MD 模擬結果與理論模型預測值進行比對，相互校正彼此(模擬工具
與理論模型)不足之處。計畫亦企圖透過模擬實驗，研究不同材料間的介面熱阻，以釐清介面的影響機
制，提供介面設計所需的相關知識。為克服 MD 模擬的龐大計算量，計畫亦發展平行化(parallel

用空間分散法來進行平行計算。另外，在準確性與計算量的同時考慮下，我們設計均質NEMD(圖一a)
及非均質NEMD(圖一b)兩種冷熱槽配置設計。前者適合樣品為單一材料時使用，熱傳方向採用週期性
邊界條件，人為因素較少；後者則適合異質介面的模擬，將冷熱槽放置於樣品兩末端，槽外並有數層固
定原子以防冷熱槽原子蒸發或大變形，此些固定原子可等效形成絕熱邊界，不過原子固定不動等同絕對
零度，為一較不合理現象。

五、 結果與討論 
5.1 聲子態密度 
首先我們要確認位能函數的適用性，圖二為本計畫 EMD 所得到之矽和鍺塊材的聲子色散關係，乃
透過量測原子位移時間訊號，再經傅立葉轉換獲得。圖中顯示雖然光頻及橫波聲頻於高頻處模擬結果
與實驗數據稍有差異，但主宰熱傳的縱波聲頻及橫波聲頻低頻處模擬結果與實驗數據極為吻合，因此
我們可確認所採用之位能函數及其相關參數是合宜的。 
接著我們再以 EMD 求得其他奈米薄膜、奈米管及矽鍺超晶格薄膜之聲子色散關係，得圖三及圖四。
薄膜與塊材最大的不同為薄膜會有離散模式(discrete modes)出現，其主要出現在聲頻的部份，並有少許
模式從縱波聲頻支與光頻支的交會點延伸出來，這些模式的出現導致整體色散曲線斜率降低，聲子群
速變慢，造成薄膜的熱傳導係數會比塊材低。除了主要的振動模式外，右下角亦出現了很多較低頻的
模式，且膜越薄有越多比例的聲子分佈於此。奈米線的色散曲線與薄膜非常接近，且隨著直徑的縮小，
其變化的趨勢與薄膜也相同，唯一的差別為奈米線的色散曲線出現有負斜率的地方。菱形結構是矽鍺
超晶格薄膜聲子色散關係最大的特色，顯示迷你布里淵區(mini Brillouin zone)的生成，為超晶格的週期
所導致。這些迷你區的出現產生了新的迷你能隙，且光頻支的曲線逐漸趨於平緩，其斜率幾乎為零，
導致整體聲子群速下降更多，因此超晶格的熱傳導係數預期會比薄膜及奈米線還低。 
聲子態密度則繪於圖五。在高頻的高峰處，薄膜及奈米管皆比塊材來的低，且越薄的膜會越低，

從左至右依序為縱波、偏振方向為 x 方向的橫波以及 y 方向橫波。

5.2 NEMD 程式測試 
我們利用速度重整法在材料內部某區域內加入或移除能量，藉此於材料內部產生一穩態的熱流現
象。加入或移除之能量大小若為固定值，表示控制熱流量；也可因應調整，以控制某邊界之溫度。以
本計畫所研究之奈米管(截面約呈正八邊形)為例(圖六)，紅色區域為加熱區，每時步都會以速度重整法
加入一固定值之能量，綠色區域為冷卻區，每時步也移除一相同固定值之能量，一股沿z方向之固定熱
流量於焉產生。薄膜情況亦類似。圖七則是達穩態後再取時間平均後的溫度分佈圖。在加熱區及移熱
區因散射強烈，溫度乃呈非線性分佈，欲以Fourier’s law求取熱傳導係數時，必須避開此一區段。圖八
顯示熱傳導係數與截去(非線性)區域大小的關係，基本上太小會有非線性汙染，太大則會有線性區
域過小、統計誤差過大之虞，因此適當的選擇很重要。在此，我們取熱傳導係數約略成水平時之
值。圖九為不同模擬長度下所獲得的熱傳導係數，可發現相當符合線性關係[42]，因此我們乃再利用外
插法來求得無窮長材料的熱傳導係數，以修正因模擬樣品不夠大所造成的數值尺寸效應。圖十則為進
一步量子修正後之矽薄膜熱傳導係數對溫度分佈圖，其中分別採用塊材、薄膜、及Debye model之態密
度來進行量子修正。可以發現溫度愈低，量子修正愈重要，而且採用的態密度的正確性也愈形重要。 
特別值得一提的是模擬時間一定要夠久，我們的研究經驗發現暫態時間及穩態統計時間長度都必
須夠長，模擬結果才能有收斂性；所需模擬時間又隨材料尺度增大而增長，一般來說至少要有數個
nanoseconds。特別是由於材料長度有限，熱傳遞似乎在材料內形成駐波現象，圖十一為一非均質NEMD

5.4 矽鍺超晶格熱傳導係數 
接著探討的是量子點矽鍺超晶格薄膜，如圖十三所示，在每一矽鍺介面處長有規則排列的鍺量子
點，量子點的幾何外型如圖十三右圖紅色區域所示，為一四角錐，其底部面積為  、高度為 h ；圖
中綠色區域稱為濕潤層(wetting layer)，是在實驗中成長量子過程中長出的一層薄鍺基材，在模擬中我
們設定此薄層厚度為 1 UC。為了探討量子點尺寸的影響，我們考慮兩種不同大小的量子點，分別為
 4UC, h 2UC 以及  2UC, h 1UC。我們考慮兩種不同的矽間隔層厚度，分別為 5UC (2.7 nm)與
20UC (10.9 nm)，而超晶格之模擬週期數固定為 8 個週期。最後量子點密度定義為  QD QD cN A    ，
其中 QDN 代表在截面 cA 中的量子點個數。 
在此我們參考前人的經驗，於材料兩端設區域大小為 50 個原子層(約 12.5UC, unit cell, 單位晶胞)
的熱/冷槽，在旁邊再各擺上 1UC 的固壁原子(fixed atoms)，防止原子從熱/冷槽區蒸發，這些固壁原子
的位置與速度隨模擬時間進行都不會有所改變，只有在計算作用力時才需考慮；而平面方向(x, y 方向)
採用的是週期性邊界條件。另外在邊界與熱/冷槽區材料的選擇上，為了避免熱/冷槽區與熱傳區域或是
熱/冷槽區與固壁原子在介面處有不正常形變，所以在模擬時固壁、熱/冷槽區所採用的原子種類選擇與
相鄰接的熱傳區域原子種類相同。在初始條件方面，由於矽鍺的晶格常數不同，原子在 z 方向的排列
由各自的晶格常數所組成，而平面方向則根據矽、鍺層在 z 方向的長度作為權重所得到的平均值。接
下來進行熱傳模擬時，選擇模擬系統溫度為 500K，大於鍺的德拜溫度 374K，並接近矽的德拜溫度
 11
矽，由半邊則為鍺，中間為一矽鍺混合成分的介面；以介面層之鍺原子比率為操作變因，且給定每一
比率後，我們隨機產生至少五組的原子混合分布(見圖十六)，分別取得介面熱阻後，以其平均值作為
該比率下之介面熱阻，並標出標準差，如圖十七所示。圖十七顯示厚度愈小的介面其熱阻值愈小，主
要是因為其本質(intrinsic)及雜質散射都較少。鍺比率是1及鍺比率是0的介面，都只有單一成分，前者
熱阻比後者稍大，純粹是因為介面中材料不同之故，前者為鍺，後者為矽；差異不大則是因為熱阻主
要由介面兩端之聲子不協調性(acoustic mismatch)產生，而不是由介面本身材質的本質散射貢獻而來。
圖中並標出由文獻上既有的兩個理論模型，AMM (Acoustic Mismatch Model)及DMM (Diffusive 
Mismatch Model)，所預測出來的介面熱阻，兩者都比此處模擬值來的大。事實上AMM及DMM都是假
設介面厚度為零、平面波、及彈性散色，是比較簡化了的理論模型，顯然尚無法準確地預測介面熱阻。 
由圖十七，最大的發現是2UC及10UC的介面，其熱阻隨介面成分的變化趨勢截然不同。厚度為10UC
時，介面熱阻隨介面成分的變化趨勢為一倒V字型，在鍺原子比率為0.5時為最大，顯示雜質散射為主
宰因子；厚度為2UC時，介面熱阻隨介面成分的變化趨勢卻是一W字型，即些微的摻雜反倒使整體熱
阻值降低。由於聲子的波長約略為2UC，估計介面厚度太薄時，穿隧效應會發生，介面的不純度也可
能增強非彈性散射，兩者都可能讓晶格波穿透率提升，故而降低介面熱阻值。為了確認，我們乃執行
下節的波包實驗，實際去量測介面的穿透率。

六、結論與建議 
計畫成功開發出平衡(EMD)及非平衡(NEMD)分子動力學模擬工具，並利用前者成功取得聲子的
態密度函數(Density of States)，作為中低溫時溫度量子修正之用，也利用它完成異質介面穿透率的量測
與研究；利用後者完成尺寸效應對矽奈米線、奈米薄膜及矽鍺量子點超晶格薄膜熱傳導係數影響之研
究，且所獲得的熱傳導係數已導入正確的溫度量子修正及去除數值尺寸限制所引致的誤差。計畫並嘗
試去量取單一介面的熱阻，發現厚、薄介面不同的成分相依性，因而進一步進行介面穿透率模擬研究。 
由於實驗有實驗量測的困難，模擬也有模擬的假設與限制，為更徹底了解影響介面熱阻的機制，
理論分析應該是很值得投入的研究，若能有一個準確的熱阻預測模型，搭配模擬一步一步去驗證模型
對每一個機制的準確描述，對材料的研發助益將相當大。此外，本計畫所開發出來的 MD 模擬工具，
也適合其他熱門熱電材料(如 Bi2Te3 及 PbTe)晶界效應的研究。

Abstract: We employ the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simula-
tion to calculate the in-plane thermal conductivity of silicon thin films of thickness
2.2nm and 11nm. To eliminate the finite-size effect, samples of various lengths
are simulated and an extrapolation technique is applied. To perform the quantum
correction which is necessary as the MD simulation temperature is lower than De-
bye temperature, the confined phonon spectra are obtained in advance via the EMD
simulations. The investigation shows the thermal conductivities corrected based
on the bulk and thin-film phonon densities of states are very close and they agree
excellently with the theoretical predictions of a certain surface roughness. Those
uncorrected or corrected by the Debye DOS on the other hand fail in capturing the
variation trend of the thermal conductivity against the temperature.

1 Introduction
In the past decades, much attention has been attracted to the thermal behavior of
low-dimensional materials such as nanowire or thin-film structures because of the
demand for miniaturization of electronic devices. The reduced feature sizes lead
to an increase in heat dissipation density and cause failure in operation. Alter-
natively, it was also found that these low-dimensional materials provide desirable
thermal properties for possible improvements of thermoelectric devices. It is well
known that the application of a thermoelectric device is limited by its poor effi-
ciency, which in turn is limited by the material figure-of-merit, Z = S2 σek (S is the

Fourier’s law. A comparison between these two approaches can be found in the
work of Schelling, Phillpot, and Keblinski (2002).
When low-dimensional materials such as thin-film or nanowire structures are stud-
ied by using the MD method, one sometimes has to worry about the evaporation
of surface atoms. In the literature, three strategies have been proposed, including
unconstrained free surfaces (Volz, Chen, 1999; Lukes, Li, Liang, and Tien, 2000),
constrained surfaces with a few layers of fixed atoms (Lukes, Li, Liang, and Tien,
2000; Feng, Li, and Guo 2003), and a use of a surface potential (Gomes, Madrid,
and Amon, 2004; Gomes, Madrid, Goicochea, and Amon, 2006). Films with un-
constrained free surfaces take a long transient time to reach stationary and obtain
the minimum surface potential energy. Besides, the crystal may collapse when sys-
tems are at very high temperatures. The second strategy makes sure no evaporation
of surface atoms but surface atoms cannot rearrange themselves to obtain the mini-
mum surface potential energy. Gomes, Madrid, and Amon (2004) proposed a use of
the surface potential to impose an inward normal force on the surface atoms. Sur-
face atoms were thus prevented from evaporation but allowed to rearrange (Aono,
Hou, Oshima, and Ishizawa, 1982).
As far as thin films are concerned, Zhong, Wang, and Xu (2004) adopted the
Lennard-Jones potential and calculated both in-plane and cross-plane thermal con-
ductivities of thin films with free surfaces via EMD. They found the cross-plane
thermal conductivity varies significantly with the film thickness. Gomes, Madrid,
Goicochea, and Amon (2006) also adopted EMD to simulate the silicon thin film
of thickness ranging from 2 nm to 217 nm at T=300K∼1000K. They also observed
anisotropic thermal conductivities, particularly when the film is extremely thin.
Besides, they found the cross-plane thermal conductivity depends linearly on the
film thickness and is nearly temperature-independent for temperature close to or
above Debye temperature. Lukes, Li, Liang, and Tien (2000) calculated the cross-
plane thermal conductivity of argon against the film thickness via NEMD. It was
reported there is no observable difference in thermal conductivity between free- and
fixed-surface thin films. Feng, Li, and Guo (2003) simulated cross-plane thermal
conductivity of silicon thin film at T=500 K. A significant size effect and a linear
dependence of the thermal conductivity on the film thickness ranging from 2 nm to
32 nm were observed once again. Wang and Li (2006) simulated films (2.715 nm∼
54.3 nm) at T=300K. The calculated thermal conductivities agreed with theoretical
predictions corresponding to thinner films nonetheless.
Although the MD tools have been applied widely and successfully, several diffi-
culties have to be overcome. First of all, one needs to worry about the finite-size
effect. When the simulation cell is not sufficiently long, phonons may travel be-
tween the boundaries without suffering any scattering and the vibration wavelength

Lennard-Jones potential (Jones, 1924) and Morse potential (Morse, 1929) respec-
tively. For silicon, several potential models have been developed in literatures such
as Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential (Stillinger, Weber, 1985), Tersoff potential (Ter-
soff, 1986), and modified embedded atoms methods (MEAM) (Baskes, 1987). In
the present study we adopt the SW potential because it can accurately predict many
of thermal properties, such as thermal expansion coefficient and melting temper-
ature. The SW potential contains two- and three-body potentials to maintain the
diamond structure of Si, which are

2.3 Quantum correction
It is known that Eq.(9) is not a proper definition for the local temperature when
the temperature is lower than the Debye temperature (θDebye). To make correction,
one can look for the real temperature (T ) by equating the slice energy from the
quantum description to the simulated one (Lee, Biswas, Soukoulis, Wang, Chan,
and Ho, 1991; Li, Porter, and Yip, 1998; Che, Cagin, Deng, and Goddard, 2000;
Feng, Li, and Guo, 2003; Wang, Li, 2006; Gomes, Madrid, Goicochea, and Amon,
2006, McGaughey and Kaviany, 2006), that is

where D(ω) is the phonon DOS,n(ω ,T) is the equilibrium phonon distribution, ω is
the phonon frequency, and h¯ω/2 is the zero-point energy. Commonly used DOS is
the bulk DOS or the DOS calculated according to the Debye model. Previous the-
oretical investigations however have shown the phonon spectra of low dimensional
materials such as nanowire (Zou, Balandin, 2001; Huang, Chong, Chang, 2006)
and thin film (Huang, Chang, Chong, Liu, and Yu, 2007) differ from the bulk one.
For instance, the elastic continuum model predicts discrete, instead of continuous,
vibration modes in the finite dimension(s). In the present study, for consistence,
we desire the confined phonon spectra of thin films which are obtained by an EMD
approach as described below.
There are many existing methods for obtaining the phonon dispersion relations,
such as by measuring the autocorrelation function of atomic velocity (Heino, 2007),
of the displacement of atomic vibration (Trubitsyn, Dolgusheva, 2007; Miyazaki,
Nagai, and Tsukamoto, 2008), or of the atomic positions (Dickey, Paskin, 1969).
The Temperature-Quantum-Correction Effect 55
maintain the whole system at the prescribed temperature. The addition and deple-
tion of energy are not imposed until the system is stabilized.
To reduce the statistical fluctuations, the slice temperatures are averaged over suf-
ficiently many time steps (M) after the heat flow is evoked and the system becomes
stationary again. The time-averaged temperature is calculated as follows
〈TMD (z)〉M =
1
M
M−1
∑
m=0
TMD (z, tNt−m) (13)
where Nt is the total number of simulation time steps. From our previous investi-
gation (Chang, Weng, and Huang, 2008), a suitable value for M is 2 million for the
2.2nm- film and 1.2 million for the 11nm- film. Figure 2 shows an example of the
time-averaged temperature profile in the 11nm- thin film of length of Lz = 128a0.
The initial temperature (TMD,i) is 300K. A strong nonlinearity is observed near the
heat source and sink regions due to the strong scattering there. By abandoning re-
gions within a distance of 8 nm from the center of heat source and sink regions, we
take the linear fitting of the remaining parts, as shown in Fig.3, to obtain the aver-
age temperature gradient. Note the periodic boundary condition has been used to
connect data at both ends. Finally, to ensure the steadiness of the system, the time
evolutions of slice temperatures are monitored and a transient time period much
larger than the traditional estimate τ = L2z/6D (Skye, Schelling, 2008) is chosen,
where D is the thermal diffusivity.

vs. x-polarized transverse, and shear vs. y-polarized transverse) everywhere except
near the zone boundary. Because the sample is finite, the incident waves and re-
flect waves near the zone boundary are merged and form standing waves, resulting
in flat dispersion curves there. This phenomenon is not captured however in the
elastic continuum model. Shown in Fig.7 are the phonon densities of states of the
bulk Si and the Si thin films at TMD,i=300K. The simulation domains employed
are 20a0×20a0×20a0 for bulk Si and 4a0×8a0×200a0and 20a0×20a0×192a0 for
films. Only slight difference is observed, mainly in the peak corresponding to
the optical branch which seemingly decreases with decreasing film thickness. The
DOS of the 11nm- film is almost indistinguishable from the bulk one.

3.4 Quantum correction
Figure 8 shows the quantum correction results according to Eq.(10) by adopting
the Debye DOS or those shown in Fig.7. In the Debye model, a linear dispersion
relation is assumed and the DOS is proportion to ω2. In Fig.8, we find that the
corrected temperature is always smaller than the MD simulated temperature. The
corrected temperatures based on the bulk DOS and thin film DOS are about the
same and close to the corrected results (denoted as Ta in Fig.8) (Gomes, Madrid,
The Temperature-Quantum-Correction Effect 59
Goicochea, and Amon, 2006) according to the lattice-dynamics calculation under
the assumption of an isotropic continuum medium and a use of the bulk dispersion
relation. Gomes, Madrid, Goicochea, and Amon (2006) also measured the bulk
specific heat (C) and estimated the corrected temperature by assuming ∂T/∂TMD=
3NkB/C. The corrections (denoted as Tc in Fig.8) instead coincide with the Debye
results.
Fig. 9 shows the ratio of the thermal conductivities of thin films after (k) and
before (kMD) the quantum correction. Note these thermal conductivities are all free
from the finite-size effect. As seen, the ratio decreases and the difference between
models increases with decreasing temperature and with decreasing film thickness.
The Debye correction results in larger values generally. In remark, the Debye model
is seemingly not a good choice for quantum correction and unless the temperature
is very low (compared to the Debye temperature) or the film is very thin (compared
to the phonon wavelength), a use of the bulk DOS for the quantum correction is
reasonable and sufficient.

4 Conclusion
In this study, we employed the NEMD approach to calculate the in-plane ther-
mal conductivity of silicon thin films of thickness 2.2nm and 11nm. The so-called
finite-size effect was eliminated via a linear extrapolation technique. Three differ-
ent phonon densities of states were tested for the quantum correction, the Debye
DOS, the bulk DOS, and the thin-film DOS; the latter two were obtained via EMD.
The investigation shows the thermal conductivities corrected based on the bulk
DOS are very close to those corrected based on the thin-film DOS and both agree
excellently with the theoretical predictions of a certain surface roughness based on
the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Those uncorrected or corrected by the
Debye DOS on the other hand fail in capturing the temperature variation trend. In
remark, the elimination of the finite size effect and a proper phonon DOS are both
essential for obtaining accurate thermal conductivities of infinitely-long thin films
and a use of the bulk phonon density of states is sufficient for the thin films and
temperatures investigated herein.

[6e8,16] are incapable of capturing the phonon behaviors near the
boundary of the Brillouin zone. Besides, the elastic models are
isotropic and thus useful only for crystalline materials. To improve
the accuracy of the PBTE solutions, the actual conﬁned phonon
spectra must be incorporated. And this constitutes the motivation
of this work.
The phonon properties of low-dimensional materials can be
best compassed via the molecular dynamics simulations (MD).
Given a proper interatomic potential and the initial positions and
velocities of atoms, MD traces the atomic trajectories by Newton's
second law. Phonon dispersion relations and the phonon density of
states are obtainable by measuring the vibrational motion of atoms
from an equilibrium system and taking advantage of Fourier
transforms [23]. In addition to ameliorating the PBTE solutions,
these conﬁned phonon spectra are also relevant for interpreting the
MD simulation results. Traditionally, one deﬁnes the temperature
(TMD) by equating it to the average atomic kinetic energy divided by
3kB/2, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. This deﬁnition fails
nonetheless when the temperature is not high enough (below the
Debye temperature qDebye) to allow all vibrational modes excited. A
quantum correction [14,24e26] thus becomes necessary, which
demands the information of the conﬁned phonon density of states.
The thermal conductivity on the other hand can be calculated
either via the Green-Kubo relation measured from an equilibrium
MD (EMD) simulation or based on the Fourier's conduction law and
the measured temperature gradient and heat ﬂux from a non-
equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulation. A comparison between these
two approaches can be found in the work of Schelling et al. [27]. To
imitate a real system that possesses temperature gradients, we
choose NEMD for calculating the thermal conductivity in the
present study.
In this work, we thus intend to apply the EMD approach to
obtain the conﬁned phonon spectra and apply the NEMD approach
to study the axial thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires. The
StillingereWeber (SW) interatomic potential is adopted. To speed
up the computations, a parallel simulation code taking advantage of
the spatial-decomposition technique [28] is developed.
2. Computational methodology
The MD simulations start from a selection of a suitable potential
function to describe the interaction among atoms. Several potential
models have been developed for silicon in the literatures such as
StillingereWeber (SW) potential, Tersoff potential, and modiﬁed
embedded atoms methods (MEAM). Heino [29] employed MEAM
for silicon thin ﬁlms. His calculations of the dispersion relations of
bulk silicon didn't agree well with the inelastic-neutron-scattering
measurements [30], except for long acoustic phonons. In this study
we adopt the SW potential because it can accurately predict
experimental measurements of bulk dispersion relations, speciﬁc
heats, thermal expansion coefﬁcient, the elastic constants and
melting temperature [27]. The SW potential contains two- and
three-body potentials to maintain the diamond structure of silicon.
The involved parametric values used herein are all extracted from
the work of Schelling et al. (2002) [27].
2.1. EMD and NEMD approaches
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the simulated nanowire, which
has an approximately octagonal cross section and a length of Lz in
the z [100] direction. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed in
the z direction and the surface of the nanowire is free. The time
marching is executed via the velocity-verlet method. In an EMD
simulation, the system is initially set at TMD ¼ 300 K with a Max-
welleBoltzmann velocity distribution. The simulation is ﬁrst run
for 30 ps by enforcing the system temperature at 300 K using the
velocity rescaling technique and then for another 30 ps for the
system to reach new equilibrium after the velocity rescaling is
turned off. The time period 30 ps is chosen to ensure the current
autocorrelation coefﬁcient [27] and the velocity autocorrelation
coefﬁcient [23] have both dropped below 1%. The system thus
reaches its thermal equilibrium at the prescribed temperature
(TMD ¼ 300 K) and statistic samples are not collected until now.
To generate a constant heat ﬂux in the system (a non-equilib-
rium system), we adopt the velocity-rescaling algorithm suggested
by Jund et al. [31]. As shown in Fig. 1, an amount of heat D3 is added
into the region of thickness d(chosen to be 1.2 nm in this study)
centered at z ¼ Lz=4 (source region) and removed from the region
of same thickness centered at z ¼ 3Lz=4 (sink region) at every
simulation time step. The system is divided into slices along the z
direction, each having a thickness of 1/4 lattice constant (about
0.14 nm). When the system achieves stationary, a local equilibrium
is also assumed within each slice. The classical temperature is then
calculated based on the temporal average kinetic energy of atoms
within each slice. A quantum correction in a way to be described
later follows immediately. The thermal conductivity is ﬁnally
calculated based on the ratio of the temperature gradient and the

bulk density of states is acceptable for low-dimensional materials
but the Debye-model one is not.
3.2. Axial thermal conductivity
Besides the conﬁned phonon spectra, we also calculate the
thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires in the present study. The
simulation is ﬁrst run for 55 ps (Dt¼ 0.55 fs) by enforcing thewhole
system at a prescribed temperature. The energy addition and
extractionmechanism is then actuated and the simulation is run for
another 660 ps for the non-equilibrium system to reach stationary.
Statistical samples are then taken. Fig. 6 shows the averaged
temperature distribution over 990 ps for the silicon wire of diam-
eter 7.6 nm and length 82 nm. Note all the temperatures have been
quantum corrected by using the conﬁned phonon density of states
of the silicon wire. By truncating the nonlinear part of the
temperature distribution (bracketed by the dash dotted lines),
which arises from the strong scattering in the energy source and
sink regions, we take the remaining linear part and the imposed
heat ﬂux to calculate the thermal conductivity.
Such a thermal conductivity is however not the thermal
conductivity of an inﬁnitely long wire due to the numerical ﬁnite-
size effect; in other words, the wave length of the lattice vibration
that can be excited is limited by the simulated wire length Lz. To ﬁx
it, we adopt the extrapolation strategy suggested by Schelling et al.
[27]. Based on the belief that the inverse of the thermal conduc-
tivity (k) is linearly related to the inverse of the simulated wire
length, several lengths are ﬁrst simulated and the thermal
conductivity of the inﬁnitely long wire is then extrapolated by
letting 1/Lz/ 0. The linear dependence of 1/k on 1/Lz is conﬁrmed
in all wires and temperatures simulated herein. Fig. 7 illustrates the
results at TMD ¼ 400 K.
The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of
inﬁnitely long silicon wires is now shown in Fig. 8, compared with
that of inﬁnite silicon thin ﬁlms. It is seen the thermal conductivity

acoustic phonon modes accompanied with smaller group velocities,
many additional modes are excited in the region of large wave
numbers and small frequencies, resulting in a shifted distribution of
the phonon density of states. This is explained by the decreasing
bonding force acting on the surface atoms. The lattice thermal
conductivities of siliconwiresofdiameter4.1nm, 7.6nm,and10.6nm
are also calculated using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulation. The temperature quantum correction is done based on
the conﬁned phonon density of states and the extrapolation tech-
nique is employed to eliminate the numerical ﬁnite-size error. It is
found the lattice thermal conductivities of silicon nanowires are
largely reduced due to the surface scattering and the conﬁned,
smaller, phonon group velocity and depend only weakly on the
temperature, implying a dominance of the surface scattering over the
phononephonon interaction.

the finite-size effect, the quantum correction, and
the confined phonon spectra all into consideration,
which constituted the motivation for this work.
In the present study, we attempted to apply the
NEMD approach to study the in-plane thermal con-
ductivity of silicon thin films. Three film thicknesses,
2.2 nm, 4.4 nm, and 11 nm, were investigated with
the aim of determining the lattice thermal conduc-
tivities against temperature. The finite-size effect
was eliminated by extrapolating the desired thermal
conductivity from those of finite-size systems.10
Moreover, we managed to obtain the confined phonon
spectra via equilibrium MD (EMD) simulations. To
speed up the computations, all simulations were
parallelized according to the spatial decomposition.11
COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY
In this work, the Stillinger–Weber potential was
adopted to describe the interactions of silicon
atoms.12 A simulated thin film having a simulation
domain of Lx  Ly  Lz is shown in Fig. 1. Periodic
boundary conditions were used in both the y and z
(in-plane) directions, while a surface potential13 was
applied in the x direction by setting reference planes
initially parallel to the film at a distance rcw from
the surfaces of the film. An inward force was thus
imposed on an atom whenever the distance between
the atom and the reference plane became smaller
than rcw. To predict the thermal conductivity, a
constant heat flux was generated across the simu-
lation domain by the velocity rescaling technique.14
An amount of heat De was added in a source region
and removed from a sink region. Schelling et al.10
suggested a proper amount of heat flux to be
1  104 eVnm2. To calculate the temperature
distribution, the simulation domain was divided
into many slices along the z direction, each of width
0.14 nm (1/4 lattice constant). Local equilibrium
was assumed, and in accordance with the equipar-
tition principle, the instantaneous temperature was
defined as
TMD z; tð Þ ¼
XNxy
i¼1
mv2i
,
3Nxykb; (1)
where m is the atomic mass of Si and Nxy is the
total number of atoms in the slice. Nonetheless, it
is known that Eq. 1 is not appropriate when the
temperature is lower than the Debye temperature.
To apply a correction, one can search for the real
temperature by equating the system energy from
the quantum description to the simulated one,13
that is,

where D(x) is the phonon density of states (DOS),
n(x, T) is the equilibrium phonon distribution, x is
the phonon frequency, and the zero-point energy is
hx=2. Commonly, the DOS calculated from the
Debye model is used. In the present study we aim to
determine the confined phonon spectra of thin films,
which can be obtained by measuring the atomic
velocity autocorrelation function

where N is the total number of atoms in the equi-
librium system. Once the temperature profile in the
simulation domain has been obtained, the thermal
conductivity can be calculated by Fourier’s law.
However, this value increases with increasing
size of simulation domain. To obtain the thermal
conductivity of infinite thin films, we adopted the
extrapolation strategy suggested by Schelling
et al.10 In this work, four domain lengths (Lz val-
ues), namely 70 nm, 87 nm, 104 nm, and 122 nm,
were simulated first, and then the thermal conduc-
tivity of the infinite thin film was extrapolated then.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows the phonon densities of states of
bulk Si and the Si thin films at 300 K. The differ-
ence lies mainly in the two peaks corresponding
to the optical branch and acoustic branch. Both
peaks decrease with decreasing film thickness, and
the densities of states on the lower-frequency side
increase correspondingly. This phenomenon may be
explained by the reduction in the elasticity coeffi-
cient when the dimension is reduced or equivalently
the surface atoms become less restricted, and the
well-known fact that the vibration frequency is
proportional to the square root of the elasticity
coefficient. Although the difference in the DOS is
not great, the difference in the quantum correction
results is not negligible at lower temperatures and
for very thin films, as also shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 3 shows an illustration of the temperature
distribution for a film thickness of 4.4 nm and

summarized in Table I. One may notice that, the
thicker the film, the larger the r*/Lz that is required,
because the boundary scattering is weaker and
consequently the phonon mean free path is larger.
We finally show the thermal conductivities of thin
films of thickness 2.2 nm, 4.4 nm, and 11 nm
against temperature T in Fig. 5, compared with the
analytical predictions.6 All MD-predicted thermal
conductivities are free from the finite-size effect.
The results quantum-corrected using the Debye
DOS and the confined film DOS are both presented.
In the analysis, the confined phonon spectra
obtained by solving the continuous elastic vibration
equation were employed, and only phonon–phonon
scattering and boundary scattering were taken into
consideration in order to comply with the MD sim-
ulation conditions. Also a parameter, p, corre-
sponding to the fraction of phonons that are
specularly reflected at the surfaces, was introduced
as usual to characterize the surface roughness in
the analysis. Figure 5 shows, unsurprisingly, that
due to the enhanced surface scattering, the thinner
film has a smaller thermal conductivity. Besides,
the MD results corrected by the confined DOS
show a similar variation trend against temperature
to the analytical predictions; namely, the thermal
conductivity increases first because of increasing
excited phonon modes and then slowly decreases
with increasing Umklapp scattering as the tem-
perature increases. Because surface scattering
dominates over phonon–phonon scattering, the
thinnest film even shows nearly temperature-inde-
pendent thermal conductivity beyond 300 K. Such
a trend is not captured, on the other hand, when
the Debye DOS is employed for the quantum
correction of temperature.
Overall, we note that the thermal conductivities
corrected by the confined DOS collapse excellently
onto the analytical curve for a single value of p,
implying a similar surface roughness for all tem-
peratures investigated. Because the parameters
involved in the surface potential are fixed for all the
simulations, a similar surface roughness thus
stands to reason. The surface roughness, defined as
the standard variation of the x-coordinates (thick-
ness direction) of the surface atoms, was measured
and found to be 0.014–0.019 nm for the film of
thickness 2.2 nm and 0.012–0.018 nm for the films
of thickness 4.4 nm and 11 nm from 300 K to 700 K.
Their thermal conductivities agree with the theo-
retical predictions using a specular fraction of
0.63 and 0.7, respectively. This gives some correla-
tion between the specular fraction p used in the
analysis and the surface roughness measured in
the laboratory.
CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, we employed the NEMD
approach to calculate the in-plane thermal conduc-
tivity of silicon thin films. To avoid contamination of
the temperature nonlinearity caused by the heat
addition/rejection technique, the truncated regions
for a linear fit must be carefully chosen. The present
investigation found that a larger region should be
truncated for a thicker film or for a longer simula-
tion domain. The investigation also showed that
quantum correction of the temperature based on the
confined thin-film DOS is necessary, and the ther-
mal conductivities obtained in this way agreed very
well with analytical predictions based on the pho-
non Boltzmann transport equation and the confined
discrete phonon spectra.

reflected/transmitted phonons at an interface, 
p, is used to characterize the roughness of 
the interfaces as usual. Finally, the inelastic 
acoustic mismatch model is employed to 
compute the specular transmissivity and the 
transmitted angle. For details of the method, 
readers are referred to the work of Huang et 
al9. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We show the computed cross-plane 
thermal conductivities of superlattice thin 
films against the superlattice period and the 
specular fraction of the interface in Fig.1. 
The agreement with the analytical 
predictions12 is obvious and within 
expectation because same physical models 
are adopted. The thermal conductivity 
decreases with decreasing period and 
increasing interface roughness as expected. 
The former increases the interface scattering 
frequency and the latter enhances its 
strength.  
The agreement between the computed 
in-plane thermal conductivities and the 
analytical predictions6 on the other hand is 
poorer as shown in Fig.2. To quantify the 
difference in the predictions of the thermal 
conductivity reduction, we define and 
compute the reduction difference as 
MC analytic bulk MCk k k k− −  
where bulkk  is the effective in-plane 
thermal conductivity from the bulk 
viewpoint, namely

and Sik  and Gek are the bulk thermal 
conducitivities of Si and Ge respectively. 
From Fig.3, it is found the difference is 
larger when the interface is smoother and 
when the layer is thicker. These 
discrepancies may be explained by the two 
major dissimilarities between the physical 
models employed in the simulation and 
those employed in the analysis: the elastic 
acoustic mismatch model for spectrally 
reflected/transmitted phonons and the 
non-grey media in the analytic predictions. 
Interesting is a much better agreement can 
be obtained if a smaller temperature is 
employed in the analysis (dashed curves in 
Fig.2a) to compensate the discrepancy 
caused by the frequency-dependent phonon 
properties. 
As the ratio of the layer thicknesses is 
varied with the superlattice period fixed, the 
variations of the effective in-plane thermal 
conductivity ( effk ) of the superlattice thin 
film are shown in Fig.4. Surprisingly, there 
exists an optimum thickness ratio with 
which the in-plane thermal conductivity is 
the minimum. If the interface effect is 
ignored, the thermal conductivities of layers 
are invariant and the overall thermal 
conductivity decreases with decreasing 
Si Ged d  because of Si Gek k> . However, the

COMPUTATIONAL METHODOLOGY 
In this work, the Stillinger-Weber potential is adopted to 
describe the interactions of silicon atoms.12 A simulated thin 
film having a simulation domain of x y zL L L× ×  is shown in 
Fig 1. Periodic boundary conditions are used in both the y and 
z (in-plane) directions, while a surface potential13 is applied in 
the x direction by setting the reference planes parallel to the 
film and at a distance cwr  from the surfaces of the film. An 
inward force is then imposed on an atom whenever the distance 
between the atom and the reference plane becomes smaller than 
cwr . To predict the thermal conductivity, a constant heat flux is 
generated across the simulation domain by the velocity 
rescaling technique.14 An amount of heat εΔ  is added in a 
source region and removed from a sink region. Schelling et al. 
10  suggested a proper amount of heat flux is 4 21 10 eV nm−× . 
To calculate the temperature distribution, the simulation 
domain is divided into many slices along the z direction and the 
width of each slice is roughly 0.14 nm (1/4 lattice constant). A 
local equilibrium is assumed and in accordance with the 
equipartition principle, the instantaneous temperature is defined 
as

where m is the atomic mass of Si and xyN  is the total number 
of atoms in the slice. Nonetheless, it is known that Eq.(1) is not 
appropriate when the temperature is lower than Debye 
temperature. To make correction, one can look for the real 
temperature by equating the system energy from the quantum 
description to the simulated one,13 that is

where ( )D ω  is the phonon density of states (DOS), ( ),n Tω  
is the equilibrium phonon distribution, ω  is the phonon 
frequency, and the zero-point energy is 2ω= . Commonly 
used DOS is the DOS calculated from the Debye model. For 
consistence, in the present study we desire the confined phonon 
spectra of thin films, which can be obtained by measuring the 
atomic velocity autocorrelation function

Once the temperature profile in the simulation domain is 
obtained, the thermal conductivity is calculated by the Fourier’s 
law. However, this value increases with increasing size of the 
simulation domain. To obtain the thermal conductivity of 
infinite thin films, we adopt the extrapolation strategy 
suggested by Schelling et al.10. In this work, four domain 
lengths ( zL ’s), namely 70 nm, 87 nm, 104 nm and 122 nm, are 
simulated first and the thermal conductivity of the infinite thin 
film is extrapolated based on these results. 
THE RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Shown in Fig. 2 are the phonon densities of states of the 
bulk Si and the Si thin films at 300K. The difference lies 
mainly in the two peaks corresponding to the optical branch 
and acoustic branch. Both peaks decrease with decreasing film 
thickness and the densities of states on the lower-frequency 
side increase correspondingly. This phenomenon may be 
explained by the reduction in the elasticity coefficient when the 
dimension is reduced or equivalently the surface atoms become 
less restricted and the well-known truth that the vibration 
frequency is proportional to the square root of the elasticity 
coefficient. Although the difference in the DOS is not much, 
the difference in the quantum correction results is not 
negligible at lower temperatures and for very thin films as also 
shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 3 shows an illustration of the temperature distribution, 
which film thickness is 4.4 nm and zL  length is 87 nm. 
Highly nonlinear profiles are obviously seen near the heat 
addition and rejection regions due to the strong scattering 
caused by the velocity rescaling. From our simulations, we find 
such a nonlinear region is bigger when the simulation domain 
is longer. This is because the phonon mean free path becomes 
larger and consequently the scattered phonons prorogate 
farther. To avoid the contamination of the nonlinearity, we try 
to find a linear fit to the temperatures by truncating the regions 
within a distance σ* from the heat addition and rejection 
regions, as shown in Fig. 3. By varying σ*/ zL , the so-obtained 
thermal conductivity based on the linear fit and the Fourier’s 
law is shown in Fig.4. It is observed that the thermal 
conductivity initially increases as σ*/ zL  increases because of 
the decreasing contribution from the nonlinear part. The 
increase slows down when σ*≈0.11 zL . A too large value of 
σ*/ zL  on the other hand leads to insufficient data for linear 
fitting and causes large variations. Hence, we take σ*=0.11 zL  
as a proper choice for this film thickness under the 
consideration of both the nonlinearity and statistical error. 
Choices for all the film thicknesses investigated are thus 
summarized in Table I. One may notice the thicker film, the 
larger σ*/ zL  is required, which is because the boundary 
scattering is weaker and consequently the phonon mean free 
path is larger. 
We finally show the thermal conductivities of thin films of 
thickness 2.2 nm, 4.4 nm, and 11 nm against the temperature  
T  in Fig. 5, compared with the analytical predictions.6 All MD 
predicted thermal conductivities are free from the finite-size 
effect. The quantum corrected results by the Debye DOS and

二、與會心得 
World Academy of Science (WASET) 是一個國際組織，從網路上資料顯示它每年都會舉
辦各種不同領域的學術研討會；以往我從未參加過這個組織所舉辦的任何會議，這次因為在
巴黎舉行，對從未到過巴黎、在美國念研究所、多半只到美國進行學術交流的我很有吸引力，
因此想說到巴黎走一趟，看看能不能認識認識一些歐洲人士，進行不一樣的交流。 
會議結果其實是令人沮喪的。首先這不是我原先以為的第六屆國際流體力學研討會，而
是很多不同主題聯合在一起舉辦的綜合性研討會，會議名稱統稱為 International University 
Conference。我對綜合性研討會興趣並不大，因為太不容易去瞭解彼此的研究內容，很難去
交流或學習到甚麼知識。果不其然，我十五分鐘的口頭報告結束後，現場並無人詢問我任何
問題；雖然事後有一捷克學者 email 與我聯繫，但也只是對在網路資料庫中出版我的文章有
興趣罷了，並非實質上的研究交流。舉辦單位應該卻沒有在大會網頁上講清楚，對預期可從
大會中吸收流體力學知識的我來說，有些失落。其次，大會同一時間僅只安排兩場次的演講，
每個場次演講者數目相當之多，本來還懷疑這樣我能報告的時間有多少？結果卻是出席率大
約只有一半，因此與會者並無法從會議安排好的順序時間表中於預期的時間聽到預測的論文
報告。原本以為能與歐洲先進的學者交流的期待最後是落空的。 
拿到會議論文集時，倒是有點驚訝地發現竟然是臺灣的力學期刊(Journal of Mechanics)
為大會印製會議論文集的，頓時有種人不親土親的感覺。巴黎也確實不愧為世界藝術之都，

Paper Title A Further Improvement on the Resurrected Core-Spreading Vortex Method 
Abstract In a previously developed fast vortex method, the diffusion of the 
vortex sheet induced at the solid wall by the no-slip boundary 
conditions was modeled according to the approximation solution 
of Koumoutsakos and converted into discrete blobs in the vicinity 
of the wall. This scheme had been successfully applied to a 
simulation of the flow induced with an impulsively initiated 
circular cylinder. In this work, further modifications on this vortex 
method are attempted, including replacing the approximation 
solution by the boundary-element-method solution, incorporating a 
new algorithm for handling the over-weak vortex blobs, and 
diffusing the vortex sheet circulation in a new way suitable for 
high-curvature solid bodies. The accuracy is thus largely 
improved. The predictions of lift and drag coefficients for a 
uniform flow past a NASA airfoil agree well with the existing 
literature.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE resurrected core-spreading vortex method [1] 
captures correctly the diffusion phenomenon by linearly 
increasing the characteristic area of the Gaussian blobs [2] and 
imposing an upper bound on the characteristic area via a 
blob-splitting technique [3] [4]. To control the total number of 
vortex blobs, an algorithm was designed to merge similar and 
nearby vortices [4]. To speed up the calculation of the 
velocities, the multipole method was implemented [1]. This fast 
resurrected core-spreading vortex method is attractive because 
it is deterministic, grid-free, efficient, and exact for uniform 
flow fields, unlike those grid-based finite-difference methods 
(such as those described by Chang & Chern [5], Lu & Shen [6], 
and Lu & Ross [7]) that make the code no longer grid-free and 
might result in excessive interpolation errors or those 
redistribution methods (such as those proposed by Degond & 
Mas-Gallic [8], Fishelov (1990) [9], and Shankar & van 
Dommelen [10][11]) that rely strongly on the remeshing 
technique.

resurrected core-spreading vortex method [1] chose to place a 
vortex sheet at the wall and solve its strength with a 
boundary-element method and constant panels [12]; 
Koumoutsakos’ analytical solution [13] was properly 
discretized to model the diffusion of the vortex sheet at a later 
time. When applied to the flow with an impulsively initiated 
circular cylinder, this vortex method performed excellently at 
early times but gradually lost its accuracy as the simulated time 
increased. A careful examination found two possible reasons. 
The first one involves the extremely weak vortex blobs that are 
generated after successive splitting processes and were deleted 
directly from the simulation. Without deleting these over-weak 
vortex blobs, the total number of vortex blobs blows up quickly 
however. The amount of circulation deleted accumulated with 
time and eventually caused unacceptable errors. The second 
reason is attributed to the employed constant panels that ignore 
the local curvature of the solid walls. In this work, the authors 
would like to explore these two error sources and possibly 
improve the accuracy. Flows past a NASA airfoil are targeted. 
The resurrected core-spreading vortex method is briefly 
reviewed in Sec. II. The generation and diffusion of the vortex 
sheet on the solid wall are modeled in Sec. III. The over-weak 
vortex blobs are handled in Sec. IV. Simulation results of 
airfoil flows are presented in Sec. V. Finally given is the 
conclusion.

of panels M, and error function erf. Alternatively, one may 
solve Pi(Eq.(8)) also by the boundary element method. We 
name these two methods as the linear method and the BE 
method. Comparisons will be made between their 
performances. 
To discretize the vorticity distribution Eq.(9) and to be 
consistent with the resurrected core-spreading vortex method, 
new blobs, called wall blobs, are generated at selected locations 
outside the solid body (having a core size of VJ). In the work of 
Huang et al. [1], these blobs were placed along the curved 
surface and each panel distributed its circulation to the 
neighboring ten blobs (see Fig.1(a)) and, most of all, each five 
of them were treated as if they were collinear (see Fig.1(b)). 
This approximation however causes unacceptable errors when 
the body curvature (such as at the trailing edge of an airfoil) is 
huge. In the present work, we instead place ten blobs outside 
each panel independently as shown in Fig.2. Although the total 
number of wall blobs is increased, it is reduced shortly by the 
merging process and thus hardly increases the computational 
time. 
IV. OTHER NUMERICAL ISSUES
A. Vortex Blobs Near the Wall 
During the simulation, some vortex blobs may move, 
because of convection or splitting, toward the wall and remain

too close to the wall such that their Gaussian tails extend into 
the interior of the solid body, causing significant errors. To fix 
it, a blob satisfying the following criterion: 
*1rr r {
JV V                                   (10) 
in which r is the distance from the wall and V is the core size of 
the blob, is judged too close to the wall and will be eliminated 
from the simulation after it gives up its circulation to nearby 
wall blobs.  
B.Over-weak Vortex Blobs 
After successive splitting processes, there can appear a huge 
number of extremely weak vortex blobs. These blobs affect 
little the flow field but cost a huge amount of computations. In 
the previous solver [1], a threshold (*tolerance) was prescribed 
and any blob which strength was smaller than this threshold

vortex blobs are not eliminated until their circulations are 
properly distributed to the neighboring blobs. The no-slip 
boundary conditions are satisfied by placing a vortex sheet on 
the solid wall, which strength is calculated by the boundary 
element method. The diffusion of this vortex sheet is either 
modeled by an approximation solution or solved by the 
boundary element method. The present study shows the former 
performs better and well in predicting the lift and drag 
coefficients for a uniform flow past a NASA airfoil with an 
angle of attack ranging from 3q to 27q.

此次本人發表的論文乃是以海報型式發表，於會議第一天即張貼於會場，海報內容比
投稿時文章之內容還豐富完整，因為多了幾個月的進度；可惜的是因為與會人士多只注重
材料製造，至於傳導性質多依賴量測，理論模擬預測分析仍是較少人感興趣。這有點矛盾，
因為近二十年來熱電再度受矚目，卻是肇因於 90 年初 MIT 的兩篇理論分析文章。 
此次參與 ICT 會議還有兩個收穫，一是認識了來自 JPL 的 Dr. Huang 及畢業自哈爾濱大
學、任職於日本公司的 Dr. Guo。二是晚宴時與 MIT 教授 Prof. Chen Gang 一番交流，特別
是請教了陳教授 MIT 在教學方面的用心。據陳教授所言，MIT 機械系的必修課除了有一位
教授主授外，每門課課堂下還坐了兩位教授，這兩位教授依主授教授的授課內容規劃並講
解習作。這樣的教學方式不僅同時提供學生課堂講授及例題講解，也給三位授課教授相當
的壓力必須將課教好。也因此， MIT 的教授在升等時，雖然教學分數也是滿足基本門檻即
可，升等成功與否仍是視研究成績而定，可是卻沒教授教學敢放鬆，因為教得認不認真同
事是知道的。 
最後整理這此與會聽到的較偏機械熱流領域的新知識或重要觀念或熱電發電重點研究

Abstract 
We successfully developed a Monte-Carlo numerical solver which is based on an 
unstructured grid and capable of simulating the phonon transport within complicated 
nanostructured materials. Two dimensional materials were constructed by using triangular 
elements and tested in this work. We first verified the accuracy of this solver by computing 
the cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities of superlattice thin films and comparing 
the results with analytical as well as regular-grid simulation results. The oblique thermal 
conductivity of superlattice thin films was next explored. The simulation results agree well 
with the predictions based on the rotation of the coordinates and the in-plane and cross-plane 
thermal conductivities at nanoscale. The solver was finally used to predict the effective 
thermal conductivity of composites composed of randomly stacked triangular silicon and 
germanium nanowires. This solver is in fact ready to be applied to composites composed of 
polygon wires of arbitrarily many materials. And it can be easily extended to three 
dimensional phonon transport phenomena, say by replacing the triangular elements by 
tetrahedrons which is currently under development.

[8]), the finite volume method (Murthy and Mathur, 2002 [9]), traditional molecular dynamics 
simulation (Hoover, 1983 [10]; Gomes et al., 2006 [11]; Volz et al., 2000 [12]), and combined 
methods (Shen and Atluri, 2004[13]).  After the pioneer work of Peterson [14], several 
schemes have been proposed to simulate the phonon transport. Among them, various 
numerical issues have been investigated and solved such as the discretization of the space and 
frequency domains, boundary conditions for generating a heat flux, scattering mechanisms, 
transmission models, and so on (e.g. Mazumder and Majumdar [15], Chen et al [16], Lacroix 
et al [17], etc.). The grey medium approximation (Jeng et al. [18], Huang et al. [19]) averages 
the phonon properties over the frequency domain and saves the computations a lot. In spite of 
underestimating the size effect (Hao et al. [20]), the qualitative variation trends and 
reasonably accurate quantitative predictions are still practicable as long as the characteristic 
length of the interested system is comparable to or smaller than the averaged phonon mean 
free path, like those to be investigated in the present work.  
In this work, we aim at extending the MC solver developed by Huang et al. [19] to 
unstructured grids and making it suitable for simulating thermoelectric materials with 
complicated nanostructures. The validity and accuracy of the proposed scheme are first 
verified by comparing the calculated in-plane and cross plane thermal conductivities of 
superlattice thin films with analytical ones. We then use this solver to investigate the oblique 
thermal conductivity of superlattice thin films and the cross-wire thermal conductivity of 
randomly assembled triangular nanowires. Both problems are basically two dimensional and 
triangular elements are a nice choice for constructing the required grid systems.

where n and g

right hand side of Eq.(1) is modeled by a single relaxation time , determined according to 
the bulk kinetic theory as

composite (b). 
A random number is next drawn and compared with the scattering probability 
 exp t   to judge whether the phonon suffers an intrinsic scattering event or not. If it 
does, its energy and group velocity are reset as the equilibrium ones at the local temperature 
and its moving direction is uniformly randomly reassigned. When the phonon bundle reaches 
the cell boundary and the cell boundary is judged to be part of a heterogeneous interface, a 
second random number is drawn to compare with the transmissivity and the phonon 
properties are reassigned according to the transmission or reflection condition. Each 
triangular cell has three neighboring cells. For each cell, we thus need to record its material 
type, global labels of its three nodes, and labels of its three neighboring cells in the computer 
memory. The time increment is so chosen that the displacement of a phonon is at most half 
the square root of the minimum cell area for each time step.  
To generate a heat flow in the system, phonons at prescribed boundary temperatures are 
injected into the simulated domain. When the nanocomposite possesses periodicity in the 
7 
 
density of the ith triangular cell (Ti is the corresponding equilibrium temperature) and Ai the 
intersected area of the ith triangular cell with the rectangular subdomain. Note each cell is 
made of a same material but not necessarily the rectangular subdomain. This definition of 
mean temperature has the advantage of preserving the total energy within the rectangular 
subdomain.

3. Superlattice thin films 
We first apply the unstructured-grid-based MC solver to the in-plane as well as 
cross-plane phonon transport problems of superlattice thin films by adopting a triangular grid 
system similar to that illustrated in Fig.1(a). As far as the cross-plane thermal conductivity is 
considered, the Si(25nm)/Ge(25nm) superlattice thin film is simulated. The imposed 
boundary temperatures are 350K and 310K. The number of phonon bundles employed is 
about 30000 per period. The 2D time-averaged temperature distribution of a 6-periods system 
is shown in Fig. 3. Temperature variations over the cross sections are controlled very small. 
When only 2 periods are employed in the simulated system, the variations are much larger but 
a nearly linear temperature distribution is still observed across each film thickness as shown 
in Fig.4. Fig. 5 shows the convergence of the calculated cross-plane thermal conductivity 
( ,effk  ) against the number of periods employed in the simulated system, compared with the 
analytical predictions [21]. The convergence is faster when the interfaces are totally diffuse 
(p=0) than when they are perfectly smooth (p=1). It is because the influence of the artificial 
(material-based pseudo-periodic) boundary condition is weakened by the interface scatterings.  
The in-plane thermal conductivity ( , ||effk ) of the Si(2nm)/Ge(2nm) superlattice thin film is

simulated system.

system respectively; the solid lines indicate the analytical predictions.

transmissivity becomes 0.5 when the two neighboring wires are made of the same material.  
Note the presently proposed algorithm is ready for polygon wires of arbitrarily many 
materials. In this paper, we choose triangular wires of Si and Ge for illustration. The 
composite in Fig.1(b) consists of a total of 210 wires (1718 cells). The cross sectional area of 
these wires ranges from 377nm2 to 1690nm2 and has an average of 929nm2 (corresponding 
wire size 2~ 929nm 30.5nm ). The whole simulation domain is about 988nm×198nm. 
With the fixed coarse and fine grids, we randomly select half of the wires to be silicon and the 
rest to be germanium. A total of ten choices are tried. The volume ratio (Si:Ge) is about 1 
(ranging from 0.91~1.09) . A periodic boundary condition is imposed in the vertical direction. 
The boundary temperatures are fixed at 340K and 320K. 
Fig. 9 shows an example of the obtained two-dimensional temperature distribution which 
has been time-averaged after the system reached stationary. The temperature is pretty uniform 
in the y direction and linear in the x direction except at the very ends. Fig. 10 shows the 
cross-sectional mean temperature and the best line fitted to the middle half data. Based on the 
temperature gradient of the best linear fitting and the measured heat flow rate, an effective 
thermal conductivity is computed. In Fig.11, we show the result averaged over the time 
interval [t,T], where T is the total simulated time (250ns). Either a too small t or a too large t 
causes large errors due to the counted transient data or too less statistic samples. Fig. 11 
suggests a proper choice of t is 75ns. We thus list all the effective thermal conductivities 
averaged over this time period for the ten simulations in Table 1, together with those of the 
composites composed of pure silicon wires or pure germanium wires. The effective thermal 
conductivity of the pure-silicon-wire composite (10.81W m K ) is about twice as large as 
that of the pure-germanium-wire composite (5.39 W m K ). Those of the 
half-silicon-and-half-germanium composites are in between and have an average of 
7.40W m K . All of them are much smaller than (about one-tenth of) the bulk counterparts 
( 137.9bulkSik W m K   and 54.3bulkGek W m K  ). 
5. Conclusion 
A Monte-Carlo simulator was successfully developed in the present work, which is based 
on unstructured grids and is capable of simulating the phonon transport phenomena within 
complicated nanostructured materials. Its accuracy and validity have been well testified. The 
thermal conductivities of superlattice thin films in a direction oblique to the film plane were 
also found to agree excellently with the predictions based on the rotation of the coordinates 
and the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities at nanoscale. For composites 
composed of triangular silicon (germanium) nanowires of size around 30nm, the effective 
thermal conductivity is found to be 10.81W m K  (5.39W m K ), which is only about 
one-tenth of the bulk counterpart. Those composed of randomly stacked silicon and

一、參加會議經過 
7/17 出發前往美國，經東京到底特律，再轉美國國內線班機到 Traverse city。 
7/17~7/21 報到、參與會議、發表論文、進行國際交流。 
7/21 啟程返台 
7/22 回到台灣 
 
二、與會心得 
國際熱電學會是一個以開發熱電材料為首要任務的國際學會，此研討會每年一屆輪流
於美洲、歐洲、亞洲舉行；若在歐洲舉行，一般會與歐洲熱電學會研討會合辦，更是精彩。
今年在美國密西根州的 Traverse city 舉辦，已知明年將在丹麥、後年在日本舉行。今年 ICT
與會人員多為材料方面專家，發表的研究內容多為新熱電材料的研發、製程設計、製程參
數影響研究、熱電性質量測與分析等等。這是本人第四次參加此國際研討會，其他出席的
台灣學者尚有來自工研院、中鋼、清華大學、彰師大等產學研單位。大會首日邀請了美國
能源局及白宮科技辦公室的 Dr. Carim 演講(plenary talk)，揭示兩大研究前瞻方向：原子合
成(atom by atom)及奈米結構合成(nanoscale objects)，說明過去幾年及未來幾年的研究動
向。演講中卻是有一句話發人省思玩味：I know we are doing things right but are we doing the 
right things.”，這應該不只是應用到學術研究上，對做人做事，還有對人類、對世界的責任
應該也是如此。 
這次 ICT 的會議各方人馬仍是積極從事熱電材料的研發，但其實本人對這些材料研發
的團隊有一些些失望，因為不少研究群的材料研發方式仍是接近試誤法(try and error)，如
調整摻雜物的濃度及種類、製程參數等等，以求最佳 ZT 材料；以實驗來尋找最佳化材料，
成本可不低。另一方面，多數研究團隊仍朝製造奈米結構以降低熱傳導係數為研發方向。
依本人多年的研究經驗，熱電效率或功率要真的有突破性的提高，應該還是要朝提高
Seebeck 係數才是積極的正道，利用奈米結構降低熱傳導係數只是消極的方式。因此本人
還是看好 PbTe 系列材料，特別是利用共振電子組態，搭配 doping 濃度，以提高 Seebeck
係數；這次與會因此選擇聆聽的演講多是 PbTe 材料研發的進展及熱電工業應用兩方面，
Bi2Te3 材料也聽了不少，畢竟它是目前 ZT 值最高的材料。可惜的是幾篇以噴墨列印方式製
作熱電偶的文章居然都缺席了，我還蠻期待的說，覺得用在紡織品或生醫應用上潛力很大，
不過至少我知道是那些研究團隊在做，後續只好靠自己追蹤了。熱電應用方面今年幾乎清
一色是廢熱回收相關的熱電發電技術應用，歐洲及美國學者皆然，即使亞洲的日本和韓國
也有很多很多的研究能量投入，相形之下，台灣腳步似乎慢了許多，除了工研院較積極外，
學界投入熱電研究的學者並不多。熱電發電技術效率太低應是大家不看好的主因，尋找除
了熱電技術別無他法的應用，或是投資報酬率尚可滿意的廢熱回收應用，應該還是值得嘗
試的。這次中鋼也派工程師來與會就是一例。

1. Introduction 
Nanostructured materials have a great potential of high thermoelectric figure of merit and 
are cheaper compared to low dimensional materials such as superlattice thin films, nanowires, 
etc. They are alloys by doping particular atoms in the crystal lattices (Brown et al. [1]), 
nanocomposites formed by hot pressing nanoparticles (Tang et al. [2), Mi et al. [3], Paul et al. 
[4]), or polycrystals condensed from solutions with special formula and cooling rates 
(Sootsman et al. [5]). The thermoelectric figure of merit is increased due to the reduced thermal 
conductivity by enhanced scatterings and due to the little deteriorated or even enhanced 
thermal power through the energy filtering effect at the heterogeneous interfaces and/or the 
grain boundaries (Quarez et al. [6], Minnich et al. [7]). No matter what fabrication method is 
employed, matrix encapsulation or hot pressing and sintering, the key issues to approach high 
thermoelectric figure of merit are the compactness and thermal stability of the 
nanocomposites. The less compact the nanocomposites, the poorer the thermal power 
becomes. Any thermal instability leads to a merger and growth of the nanograins and 
consequently a loss of the nanostructures and thus a less reduction in the thermal conductivity. 
The influence of the nanostructures on the thermal conductivity displays mainly in 
changing the behaviors of phonons. Phonons of medial to long wave lengths are expected to 
be scattered by heterogeneous interfaces or grain boundaries and phonons of short wave 
lengths by mass differences and defects. It is not easy however to analyze the phonon 
behaviors and thus optimize the nanostructures theoretically or experimentally due to the 
complexity and randomness of the nanostructures. In the laboratories, the phonon (lattice) 
thermal conductivity is usually obtained by subtracting the total thermal conductivity from the 
electronic thermal conductivity, which is estimated based on the measured electric 
conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law. The detailed behaviors of phonons are very 
important in illuminating the individual influence of various factors (such as grain sizes, grain 
shapes, composition concentrations, and so on) and optimizing the nanostructures. In this 
work, we thus aim at developing a numerical solver that is capable of simulating the phonon 
transport in the nanocomposites with complicated structures. 
Among the computational methods, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation has a significant 
advantage that it allows the study of quasiparticle transport in peculiar geometry from nano- 
to micro- scale over other direct solvers such as the discrete ordinate method (Yang et al. 2005

where kbulk is the bulk thermal conductivity and C is the acoustic specific heat. When a 
phonon incidents on a heterogeneous interface, it is either transmitted or reflected. The 
transmissivity is determined, according to the inelastic acoustic mismatch model, by

In the previous Monte-Carlo simulator [19], the computational domain is composed of 
regular and rectangular cells. To simulate nanocomposites with complicated/randomly 
distributed nanostructures, we replace the rectangular cells by triangular cells. Fig. 1 
illustrates two examples, a superlattice thin film and a compact composite composed of 
randomly stacked triangular nanowires. Each film or each nanowire is a combination of 
several triangular cells. A local thermal equilibrium is assumed within each triangular cell. 
As usual, phonon bundles carrying properties at a given initial temperature are released in 
each cell. Each phonon bundle is allowed to drift at its group velocity g  for some time 
period t , the smaller one between the time increment t and the time required for the 
phonon to reach the cell boundary. To judge which side of the cell is going to be hit, we 
number the three nodes (Pi, i=1,2, and 3) of each cell in the counterclockwise direction and 
determine the side 1i iP P  with 0g iPP  
  and 1 0g iPP  
 , where iPP

 is the vector 
from the phonon location (P) to each of the nodes and 4 1P P .

heat flux direction like the superlattice thin films, the cell-based pseudo-periodic boundary 
condition [19] is workable. That is, when a phonon bundle is injected into a cell at one end 
of the computational domain, its moving direction, location, and remaining flight time are 
assumed to be those of one of the phonons leaving from the corresponding cell at the other 
end. When no such periodicity is existent, we suggest to group the leaving phonons 
according to the material of the cell from which they are leaving. The moving direction and 
remaining flight time of an injected phonon are copied from the phonon randomly selected 
from the pool of the same cell material as the injected cell. We call this new boundary 
condition as the material-based pseudo-periodic boundary condition. 
At the end of each time step, the energy density of each cell is computed and the local 
(cell) temperature is defined as the corresponding equilibrium temperature. To speed up the 
calculations of the cell energy densities, not only the instantaneous location, velocity, and 
energy of a phonon but also the label of the cell it belongs to are traced and recorded. 
Whenever necessary, we also judge the cell to which an interested phonon belongs to by the 
criterion: 1 1 2 1 3P P P P P P   

, 0 1   , 0 1   , and 1    . 
When the simulated system reaches stationary, the temperature corresponding to the 
time-averaged energy density is calculated. To obtain the effective thermal conductivity of 
the nanocomposite, the mean temperature difference ( T ) across the middle half 
computational domain is measured. According to the Fourier’s law, the effective thermal 
conductivity is thus defined as    0 2q L A T , where appear the heat flow rate, the length 
L and the cross sectional area A of the computational domain. Moreover, an area-weighted 
average energy density is employed to calculate the mean temperature in a selected region 
when necessary. For instance, the mean temperature (T ) of the rectangular subdomain

also tested and the simulation results are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. The interface is chosen to 
be perfectly smooth to highlight the contamination of the material-based pseudo-periodic 
boundary condition. When the simulation domain is large enough (600nm in Fig.6), the 
uniformity of temperature in the cross-plane direction is satisfactory. The unstructured-grid 
simulation results agree well with those obtained based on the regular grid and the cell-based 
pseudo-periodic boundary condition as shown in Fig.7. These investigations all assert the 
replacement of the cell-based pseudo-periodic boundary condition by the material-based 
pseudo-periodic boundary condition, which is necessary if no periodicity exists in the 
composites or in the grid system, in spite of its requiring a larger simulated domain. 
At last, we look for the thermal conductivity along a direction at an angle with respect to 
the film plane when a temperature gradient is given in the same direction. Through the 
rotation of the coordinates, this thermal conductivity, ,effk  , can be written as

where , ||effk   and ,effk   are the cross thermal conductivities ( 2    ). For superlattice 
thin films, , ||effk   is relatively small compared to , ||effk  and ,effk   but not necessarily ,effk  . 
By using the calculated , ||effk  and ,effk   and ignoring , ||effk  , we show the predictions of 
Eq.(6) in Fig.8, together with the simulation results of the oblique heat transfer problems. The 
agreement is excellent for both the totally diffuse interfaces (p=0) and perfectly smooth 
interfaces (p=1).

4. Randomly stacked triangular nanowires 
We take advantage of the commercial software GAMBIT to generate complicated 
nanostructured materials in the following way. A coarse unstructured grid as shown by the 
thick lines in Fig.1(b) is first created. These thick lines represent the shapes and distribution of 
the nanowires. The cross section of each wire is next divided into several triangular cells 
(those separated by thin lines in Fig.1(b)), within each assumed is the local thermal 
equilibrium. Phonons thus suffer interface scatterings when they hit the thick lines but not the 
thin lines. In the following simulations, totally diffuse interfaces are assumed. Therefore, the 
12 
 
germanium nanowires have an effective thermal conductivity in between. This solver is ready 
for polygon wires of arbitrarily many materials. Besides, it can be easily extended to three 
dimensional problems, for instance, by replacing the triangular grids with tetrahedrons, which 
is currently under development.
