Abstract 
  The main purpose of this study was to develop a novel zerovalent metals materials 
including Fe(0) and Si(0) onto mesoporous mateirlas that is environmentally friendly to 
coupled degrade organic pollutant and heavy metals under various groundwater quality 
conditions. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichlorethylene (TCE) were selected as organic 
model compounds to understand the reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism, while Ni and 
Cu were used to elucidate the sorption and reduction mechanisms of heavy metals on the 
surface of Si(0) or Fe(0).  The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results showed that 
metal ions including Ni(II), Cu(II) and Fe(II) could be reduced to their zerovalent forms on 
the Si surface.  The dechlorination of PCE obeyed the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the 
pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) for PCE dechlorination followed the order Ni/Si > 
Fe/Si > Cu/Si.  The kobs values for PCE dechlorination in the presence of 0.1 mM Fe(II) and 
Ni(II) were 1.5-3.8 times higher than that by Si alone.  In addition, the efficiency and rate of 
PCE dechlorination increased upon increasing the mass loading of Ni(II) ranging between 
0.05 and 0.5 mM, and then decreased when further increased the Ni(II) loading to 1 mM.  
The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and electron probe microanalytical (EPMA) 
maps showed that the Ni nanoparticles deposited on the Si surface, and aggregated to a large 
particle at 1 mM Ni(II), which clearly depicts that the Ni(II) loading of 0.5 mM is the optimal 
value to enhance the efficiency and rate of PCE dechlorination by Si. Also, the reaction 
pathways for PCE dechlorination changed from hydrogenolysis in the absence of Ni(II) to 
hydrodechlorination when Ni(II) concentrations were higher than 0.05 mM.  
Different from Ni(II), addition of low concentration of Cu(II) at 0.06 wt% significantly 
enhanced the dechlorination of PCE, while high concentration of Cu(II) would occupy the 
reactive sites of Si(0), and subsequently decreased the dechlorination efficiency and rate of 
PCE.  The pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) for PCE dechlorination by 0.06 wt% Cu/Si 
was 0.028 h-1, which was 2.8 times higher than that by Si(0) alone.  However, the kobs for 
PCE dechlorination decreased to 0.0016 h-1 when the loading of Cu(II) increased to 3 wt%.  
The EPMA results showed that the distribution of 0.06 wt% Cu on the Si(0) surface was 
homogeneous without any aggregation, which means that the maximum rate constant was 
observed before the total coverage of the active sites on the reductive metal by the catalytic 
metal layer.  The calculated surface coverage of 0.06 wt% Cu onto Si(0) was approximately 
43%, which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in this study.

potential.  Fe(0) and Si(0) can react with dissolved oxygen and/or water to form ferric 
oxides and silicon dioxide.  In early 1990s, Gillham and co-workers found that Fe(0) has 
the excellent ability in dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons under anaerobic 
conditions (Gillham and O’Hannesin, 1989; 1994; Orth and Gillham, 1996).  It is quickly 
recognized that reduction of organic compounds by metal iron is a well-known classic 
electrochemical/corrosion process to both organic chemist and corrosion scientist.  Much 
of the emphasis of use of ZVM for decomposition of priority pollutants came from the 
work of Matheson and Tratynek (1994), who proposed the major pathways for reductive 
dechlorination in an anoxic Fe0-H2O system.  According to the relationship of redox 
potential between iron and target pollutant, chlorinated hydrocarbons are reduced by 
accepting electrons produced from the oxidation of ZVM:  
 
 F(0) → Fe2+ + 2e- (1-1) 
 Si(0) +2H2O → SiO2 + 4e- + 4 H+ (1-2) 
 RX + H+ +2e- →RH + X- (1-3) 
 Fe(0)/Si(0)+ RX + H+ → Fe2+ /SiO2+ RH + X- (1-4) 
 
Recent studies on the metal iron chemistry, however, showed that ZVI has several 
drawbacks in application (Scherer et al., 2000).  These include the formation of iron 
oxides on surface, the increase in solution pH and declined reactivity with time (Mackenzie 
et al., 1999; Su and Puls, 1999). Several attempts, including the use of hydrogen gas, noble 
catalysts and nanoparticles, have been made to enhance the reduction rates of priority

coupled degrade organic pollutant and heavy metals under various groundwater quality 
conditions. Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichlorethylene (TCE) were selected as organic 
model compounds to understand the reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism, while Ni 
and Cu were used to elucidate the sorption and reduction mechanisms of heavy metals on 
the surface of Si(0) or Fe(0). Results obtained in this study can be used as the framework 
for bettering understanding the role of surface characteristics of novel nanomaterials in 
electron transfers during reduction processes and the finding can be applied to the 
remediation of groundwater contaminated with priority organic pollutants and heavy 
metals simultaneously. 
 
1-3.Characterization of nanoscale zerovalent iron 
 Several techniques can be employed for the preparation of NZVI.  The use of 
physical synthetic methods such as inert gas condensation, severe plastic deformation, 
high-energy ball milling and ultrasonic shot peening can synthesize Fe(0) nanoparticles 
with diameters of 10−30 nm (Li et al., 2006).  However, the surface reactivity of these 
physically synthesized iron nanoparticles is strong and is difficult for storage and 
application.  In addition, the surface reactivity of these NZVI will gradually decrease due 
to the agglomeration of nanoparticles.  The chemical methods include microemulsion, 
chemical coprecipitation, chemical vapor condensation, pulse electrodeposition and 
chemical wet reduction (Li et al., 2006).  Chemical methods are often used for synthesis 
of small quantities of NZVI.  In addition, the diameter of synthesized NZVI can be 
adjusted to the desired particle sizes, depending on the methods and starting materials used 
for synthesis.  For example, Chio et al. (2001) used chemical vapor condensation method 
6 
 
sizes of the fresh prepared NZVI range between 8−15 nm and then aggregated to around 
20−100 nm.

1-4. The core-shell structure of iron nanoparticles 
Usually the freshly synthesized iron nanoparticles ignite spontaneously upon exposure 
to air when the particle size is too small or undergo a rapid exothermic reaction with 
oxygen under ambient condition (Sohn et al., 2006).  This oxidation process would 
generate a core-shell structure with iron oxide surrounding the iron nanoparticles.  In 
aqueous solution, NZVI would react with water and trace amount of oxygen in solution to 
produce a thin layer of ferrous hydroxide, and subsequently transforms to ferric oxides, 
resulting in the formation of core-shell iron nanoparticles.  The diameters of the freshly 
prepared ZVI particles are, in general, larger than 8 nm and the shell thicknesses of the 
freshly prepared NZVI are in the range 2-5 nm.  The formation of shell layer is important 
for iron nanoparticles to avoid the further oxidation and maintain the reactivity.  
Muftikian et al. (1995) used XPS to identify the composition of the oxide layer of 
palladized ZVI and found that the reactive bimetallic Pd/Fe surfaces were formed by the 
stepwise reduction of Pd(IV) in solution to Pd(II), which replaced protons on the 
hydroxylated iron oxide surface and formed Pd(II)-O-Fe bonds.  In addition, the oxide 
shell is an important composition of stability to protect the reactivity of the inner ZVI and 
the ability to transport the electron and mass across the shell layer.   
The composition of zerovalent iron influences the reactivity of NZVI toward 
reduction of priority pollutants.  Liu et al. (2005) have systematically investigated the 
reaction rate, pathways, and efficiency of TCE by FeBH and RNIP under anaerobic 
conditions.  The measured surface area normalized pseudo-first-order rate constant for 
FeBH is 1.4 × 10-2 L h-1 m-2, which was 4 times higher than that for RNIP (3.1 × 10-3 L h-1 
m-2).  The high reaction rate for FeBH may be attributed to the oxide shell composition and 
the boron contents for the differences between the particle types.  Although the thicker

1-5. Characterization of zrovalent silicon (Si(0) 
 Silicon is present in the earth’s crust at 27.7% of the total and, after oxygen, is the 
second most abundant element (Dojlido and Best, 1993).  Table 2-4 shows major 
elements in continental rock (Morel and Hering, 1993).  Although it does not occur as the 
native element in nature, silicon compounds is found in rocks, sand and soil, either 
combined with oxygen as silicon dioxide, (silica, SiO2), or combined with other elements 
such as aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium or iron 
(silicates).  The most commonly occurring silicates are those with Ca, Mg and Fe. 
The oxidation of Si with water, so-called “wet oxidation”, is a commercially useful 
process in semiconductor device preparation and is the subject of numerous investigation 
due to its importance in technological application (Struck et al., 1997; Oura et al., 1999).  
The reaction of Si with water could be expressed as 
 
2 H2O + Si0  = SiO2 + 2 H2 (g)                                (1-5) 
 
Zhou et al. (2001) proposed a mechanism of silicon reacting with water.  The etching 
reaction can be represented simplistically by two main steps.  A hydrogen-terminated 
silicon (H-Si) surface bond is converted to Si-OH, and the reaction of Si with water is first 
catalyzed by OH ion (eq 2-8): 
 
12 
 
The general reaction represented by eq (1-9) is a well-known member of a class of reaction 
known as dissolving reaction and is similar to silicon oxidation with alkyl halide.  The 
increase in pH favors the solubility of silicon oxide (Fig 1-1), which may eventually 
enhance the further dissolution of silicon. 
Two major reductants in an Si0-H2O systems are silicon and hydrogen gas that result 
from silicon oxidation.  These reductants suggest two general pathways for the 
dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The first pathway involves the Si0 directly 
and implies that reduction occurs by electron transfer from the silicon surface (Bressors et 
al., 1995) to the oxidant such as the adsorbed chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The reaction can 
be described by eq. 1-10.  The second pathway for reductive dehalogenation by 
zero-valent silicon involves the hydrogen produced as a product of Si0 reacting with water: 
 
2 H2O + Si0  = SiO2 + 2 H2 (g)                                (1-10) 
H2 + RX → H+ + RH + X- (1-11) 
 
In the absence of an effective catalyst, hydrogen is not a facile reductant and this reaction 
will not contribute directly to dehalogenation.  However, rapid dehalogenation by 
hydrogen is still possible if an effective catalyst, such as palladium and nickel is available 
(Lowry and Reinhard, 1999, 2000, 2001).

nanosacle.  Several studies have also depicted that the reduction rate by NZVI is 
dependent on the specific surface area of iron.  A liner relationship between reduction rate 
and surface area of iron was observed (Gillham and Hannesin, 1994; Johnson et al., 1996).  
Surface area-normalized pseudo-first-order rate constant (kSA) for contaminant degradation 
between metallic nanoparticles and reducible contaminant including chlorinated methanes, 
chlorinated ethenes, chlorinated aromatics and nitrate have been reported to be 
significantly influenced by nanoparticle size, which may vary by much 1-2 orders of 
magnitude higher than those of commercial or microscale iron powders (Lien and Zhang, 
1999; Feng, and Lim, 2005; Li et al., 2003; Lowry and Johnson, 2004; Liou et al., 2006; 
Liou et al., 2007).   
 
1-6-1 Particle size  
The reduction efficiency and rate of the individual contaminant by NZVM at different 
particle sizes varied.  Liu et al. (2005) reported that the kSA value for TCE dechlorination 
by iron nanoparticles with diameters of 30-40 nm was 1.4 × 10-2 L h-1 m-2, which is higher 
than that reported by Wang and Zhang (1997) (3 × 10-3 L h-1 m-2) which used 1-100 nm 
Fe(0) for TCE dechlorination.  Liou et al. (2006) indicate that the reactivity of iron 
nanoparticles with diameters of 9-10 nm for the denitrification of nitrate in aqueous 
solution was higher than that of iron nanoparticles with diameters of 20-60 nm.  They 
further investigated the size effect of copper nanoparticles on the dechlorination toward CT 
and found that the kSA of copper nanoparticles at 10 nm on resin was 110-120 times higher 
than that of powdered copper particles, while only 10- to 20-fold increase in kSA relative to 
that of powder copper particles were observed when the diameters of Cu nanoparticles

1-6-3. Transition metal ions 
 In addition to solution pH, the impact of transition metal ions on the reductive 
dechlorination of chlorinated compounds and nitro-aromatics by both structural Fe(II) 
species and Fe(0) has been addressed.  The deposition of small amounts of second metals 
such as Ni and Pd onto iron surface has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the 
dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons (Fennelly et al., 1998; Gui 
et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2004).   The coexistence of other heavy metal ions in aqueous 
solution also influences the reactivity of iron nanoparticles toward contaminants.  The 
core-shell structures of iron nanoparticles can serve as reductant as well as adsorbent to 
immobilize metal ion onto the surface.  The adsorbed metal ions may further receive 
electrons produced from the core layer of zerovalent iron.  This would enhance the 
reduction efficiency of reducible contaminants by converting the metal ion into its low 
valence-state form or decrease the efficiency of by competing electrons with organic 
contaminants.  Lee and Doong (2007) showed that the kobs for PCE dechlorination by 
zerovalent silicon in the presence of 0.1 mM Fe(II) and Ni(II) were 1.5–3.8 times higher 
than that in the absence of metal ions.  Schlicker et al. (2000) showed that the existence of 
Cr(VI) significantly hindered the dechlorination of chloroethenes by ZVI.  On the 
contrary, addition of catalytic ions such as Ni(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Pd(II) and Pt(II) may 
enhance the reduction rate and efficiency of chloroethenes.  Dries et al. (2005) reported 
that addition of 5-100 mg/L Ni(II) enhanced TCE reduction by 100 g/L ZVI due to the 
catalytic hydrodechlorination by bimetallic Ni(0)/Fe(0).  However, Cr(VI) and Zn(II) 
lowered TCE dechlorination rate by a factor of 2-13.   Lien et al. (2007) depicted that 
Cu(II) enhanced the CT dechlorination by NZVI, while Pb(II) only increased reduction 
18 
 
Mechanistic studies showed that the dechlorination pathways of chlorinated hydrocarbons 
by Pd/Fe or Ni/Fe changed from hydrogenolysis to hydrodechlorination, resulting in the 
formation of non-chlorinated hydrocarbons (Nutt et al., 2005; Tee et al., 2005).  In 
addition, the introduction of second catalytic metal could prevent toxic byproduct 
formation by dechlorination of PCE via hydrogen reduction rather than via electron 
transfer, which may reduce the accumulation of hydrogen gas and enhance the reduction 
rate of priority pollutants. 
Several methods can be used for preparation of bimetallic Fe(0) systems. The physical 
mixing of the reductant and catalytic metals is a simple method to prepare the bimetallic 
iron system, while chemical combination of the reductive metal to catalytic metal can 
result in a dramatical increase in the degradation efficiency of priority pollutants.  The 
bimetallic system can be prepared by the use of commercialized or self-synthesized 
nanoscale reductive metals as the reductant or adsorbent, while the catalytic metal ion 
serves as the precursor and adsorbate.  The catalytic metal ion will then be reduced into 
zerovalent metal by the addition of reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or 
by the electrochemical reduction from the reductive metal.  The structure of the 
chemically fabricated bimetallic materials prepared using this method is likely to be a 
core-shell structure  in which reductive metal acts as a core while catalytic metal serves as 
a shell (Xu et al., 2005).  In addition, both the reductive and catalytic metal ions can be 
added in a solution and then be reduced by reducing agent simultaneously.  Alloy 
structure is easily found in the method.  Since dechlorination process by ZVM is a 
surface-mediated process, the reduction efficiency of priority pollutants by core-shell 
structured bimetallic system is usually better than that of the alloy bimetallic structure 
when same ratio of catalytic metal to reductive metal was compared.

employed (Schrick et al., 2002).  When the bimetallic system was employed to 
decompose the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the dechlorination efficiency could be enhanced 
by increasing the loading of the second metal (Lin et al., 2004; Nutt et al., 2005; Tee et al., 
2005).  However, higher loading of catalytic metal on the reductant metal surface inhibits 
the dechlorination efficiency and an optimal loading usually exists.  Several plausible 
explanations including the formation of galvanic cell (Schrick et al., 2002), the surface 
coverage of catalytic metal on the reductive metal (Tee et al., 2005) and the absorbed 
atomic hydrogen (Cwiertny et al., 2006; 2007) have been proposed to explain this 
phenomenon. 
 
1-7-3. Optimal mass loading 
Several studies have depicted the effect of additive loadings toward the dechlorination 
efficiency of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Fe(0) (Nutt et al., 2005; Tee et al., 2005; Xu and 
Bhattacharyya, 2005; Bransfield et al., 2006).  An optimal mass loading exists for a wide 
variety of bimetallic catalysts.  Tee et al. (2005) investigated the role of bimetallic Ni/Fe 
nanoparticles on the dechlorination of TCE.  A higher degradation rate of TCE was 
observed upon increasing the Ni loading from 2 to 25 wt%, and then the kobs decreased 
when greater Ni loading was added.  Moreover, Lin et al. (2004) reported that the 
dechlorination rate of TCE by bimetallic Ru/Fe increased as the Ru loading increased from 
0.25 to 1.5 wt%.  A decrease in kobs was also observed when Ru loading increased to 2.0 
wt%.  In addition, Bransfield et al. (2006) depicted that a pronounced increase in kobs with 
increasing Cu loading was observed below 10 mol Cu/g　 -Fe.  Lee and Doong (2007) 
reported an optimal mass loading of Ni at 1.47 wt% was also obtained for PCE 
22 
 
Amonette et al., 2000; Pecher et al., 2002; Maithreepala and Doong, 2004, 2005).  In 
addition, the third model for dechlorination by ZVM involves the indirect electron transfer 
by atomic hydrogen produced from water reduction when catalysts such as Ni, Pd and Pt 
are present in solutions.   
Although Fe(0) and Si(0) have been successfully employed as the reactive 
materials for treatment of soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated 
hydrocarbons, several challenges including the production of chlorinated byproducts, slow 
reaction rate, and cannot dechlorinate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) still exist.  One 
of advantages for using nanoscale iron materials is that Fe(0) can degrade contaminants 
which cannot react with microscale zerovalent iron such as PCBs and chlorinated 
aromatics (Lowry and Johnson, 2004; Tratnyek and Johnson, 2006).  Zhang (2003) have 
demonstrated that nanoscale Fe(0) can effectively decompose more than 30 organic 
compounds including halogenated hydrocarbons, chlorinated aromatics, nitroaromatics, 
pesticides, and organic dyes.  Wang and Zhang (1997) used the nanoscale Fe(0) and 
Pd/Fe for dechlorination of TCE and Arochlor 1254.  The Pd/Fe resulted in the rapid and 
complete dechlorination of TCE and Arochlor 1254 after 17 h, while only < 25% of PCBs 
with biphenyl as the final product was dechlorinated by unpalladized Fe(0).  The kSA 
values for TCE and PCB dechlorination are calculated to be 10-100 times higher than those 
of commercially available microscale Fe(0) particles.  Lowry and Johnson (2004) 
compared the initial rate of dechlorination of six PCBs by bare and palladized Fe particles 
in 30% ethanol/water mixture under ambient conditions. The observed kSA for PCBs 
dechlorination by Fe(0) and 0.05 wt% Pd/Fe were in the range (5.5-100) × 10-4 L yr-1 m-2 
and (3.8-17) × 10-4 L yr-1 m-2, respectively.  For bare Fe(0), nonortho-substituted 
congeners were found to have faster initial dechlorination rates than ortho-substituted 
24 
 
and subsequently undergoes two successive fast halide ion elimination steps to form a 
mono-　-bonded vinyl surface-adsorbed species and then to acetylene. 
The reaction of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Fe is slightly different from that by 
microscale Fe(0).  The reaction mechanism and product distribution are dependent on H2 
evolution rate and the degree of crystallinity of the Fe(0).  Lowry and co-worker (Liu et 
al., 2005a, EST; 2005b, CM; Liu and Lowry, 2006) have investigated the dechlorination 
rate and pathway of TCE by different properties of Fe(0) (FeBH and RNIP).  Under both 
iron-limited and excess iron conditions, FeBH mainly transformed TCE to ethane, C3-C6 
coupling products and some unsaturated hydrocarbons (Liu et al., 2005a).  No acetylene 
was detected, while chlorinated byproducts were detected as reactive intermediates at very 
low level and disappeared quickly.  For RNIP, TCE was dechlorinated primarily into 
acetylene and ethane under iron-limited conditions.  On the contrary, ethane and ethene 
were produced when excess RNIP was used to dechlorinate TCE.  A further study (Liu et 
al., 2005b) has found that the highly disordered nature of nanoscale FeBH and partially 
oxidized FeBH provides the ability to activate and use hydrogen gas, which increases the 
rate and extent of hydrogenation and yields more saturated reaction products compared to 
crystalline FeBH, RNIP and iron fillings.  However, the reaction orders for H2 evolution 
and TCE dechlorination with respect to Fe(0) content were different, which may be 
attributed to the difference in the rate controlling steps for each reaction (Liu and Lowry, 
2006).  For H2 evolution, the formation of adsorbed H specie is the rate-limiting step, 
while TCE reduction requires that TCE adsorbs to the iron surface, and that TCE reduction 
occurs via direct electron transfer or via adsorbed H species.  
It has been shown that many chlorinated hydrocarbons can be effectively dechlorinated 
indirectly by atomic hydrogen produced from the reduction of water by the corrosion of 
26 
 
and found that these toxic metals could be reduced by Fe(0) to their low oxidation states 
and then co-precipitated with ferric oxyhydroxide on the surface of the Fe particles 
(Manning et al., 2002; Wilkin and McNeil, 2003).  Ponder et al. (2000) developed a 
supported Fe nanoparticles (ferragels), which are 10-30 nm in diameter, for the remediation 
of metal ions in aqueous solution.  The ferragels were rapidly separated and immobilized 
Cr(VI) and Pb(II) from aqueous solution by reducing the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and the Pb(II) to 
Pb(0) while oxidizing Fe(0) to goethite. In addition, the rates of remediation of Cr(VI) and 
Pb(II) by ferragels are up to 30 times higher than those for iron fillings or iron powder on a 
Fe molar basis.  Kanel et al. (2006) used nanoscale Fe(0) for the removal of As(V).  
Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that the Fe(0) is a core-shell structure in which 19% were 
in zero-valent state with a coat of 81% iron oxides.  A total of 25% As(V) were reduced to 
As(III) by Fe(0) after 90 d.  As(V) adsorption kinetics were rapid and occurred within 
minutes following a pseudo-first-order expression with kobs of 0.02-0.71 min-1. In addition, 
bimetallic Ni/Fe system was employed for the removal of arsenate (Jegadeesan et al., 
2005).  The pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) for As(V) removal by Ni/Fe was 0.091 
min-1, which is 2.5 times faster than that by Fe(0) alone (0.037 min-1).   
Several parameters including temperature, initial metal concentration, pH and 
inorganic anions influence the removal efficiency and rate of metal ions by Fe(0).  The 
increase in reaction temperature from 25 to 65 °C increased the removal rates of As(VI), 
while competitive adsorption of phosphate and sulfate was also observed (Jegadeesan et al., 
2005).  At high initial metal concentration, the removal rate shifted from 
pseudo-first-order rate kinetics to zero-order rate expression.  The pH value of the 
solution is also an important factor influencing the removal capacity of Se(VI) removal.  
High removal efficiency of Se(VI) by both nanosized ZVI and bimetallic Ni/Fe were 
28 
 
et al., 2000).  Usually the basis for sorption reaction is the corrosion of ZVI by the 
formation of mixed-valent and crystalline ferric oxides such as green rust, lepidocrocite 
and magnetite.  The iron oxides on the surface of Fe(0) are generally covered with 
hydroxyl groups in aqueous solutions, and subsequently undergo the surface complexation 
reaction with divalent cationic metal ions (Dries et al., 2005). 
 
 ≡S-OH + Me2+ ↔ ≡S-OHMe+ + H+ (1-12) 
 2 ≡S-OH + Me2+ ↔ (≡S-OH)2Me+ + 2 H+ (1-13) 
 ≡S-OH + Me2+ +H2O ↔ ≡S-OHMeOH + 2 H+ (1-14) 
 
Both sorption and precipitation processes are reversible, and therefore may require 
removal of the reactive materials and accumulated products, which is dependent on the 
stability of the immobilized compounds and the geochemistry of the groundwater.  
Surface precipitation and adsorption have been demonstrated to be predominant 
mechanisms for the removal of As(V) and As(III) by both microscale and nanoscale Fe(0).  
The spontaneous oxidation of Fe(0) in aqueous solution leads to the formation of Fe(II) 
and ferric oxides, resulting in the uptake of As(V) on iron oxyhydroixdes by a 
ligand-exchange mechanism that replaces the surface-bonded hydroxide ion with an 
irreversible and stable arsenate or inner-sphere bidentate complex (Jegadeesan et al., 
2005).

dechlorination by Si. Also, the reaction pathways for PCE dechlorination changed from 
hydrogenolysis in the absence of Ni(II) to hydrodechlorination when Ni(II) concentrations 
were higher than 0.05 mM.  Results obtained in this study reveal that the metal-deposited 
zerovalent silicon can serve as an environmentally friendly reductant for the enhanced 
degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons for long-term performance. 
 
2-1. Introduction 
Chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) 
are the most often found toxic chemicals in contaminated aquifers (Scherer et al., 2000).  
Researches including laboratory-scale and field studies have demonstrated that the use of 
zerovalent metals such as Fe, Cu and Si as reductants is a promising strategy for the 
removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated subsurface environments (Doong et 
al., 2003; Lin et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Nurmi et al., 2005).  In addition, the feasibility 
of combining zerovalent iron to dechlorinate PCE and TCE in typical enhanced 
solubilization matrices such as alcohols and surfactants has been examined (Alessi et al., 
2001; Lorain, 2001; Clark et al., 2003).  However, drawbacks including the accumulation 
of chlorinated by-products and the decrease in surface activity over time have been 
reported (Scherer et al., 2000; Jeen et al., 2007).  Several attempts have been made to 
enhance the dechlorination rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons and to prevent the 
accumulation of toxic by-products using hydrogen gas or bimetallic systems (Lowry and 
Reinhard, 1999; Nutt et al., 2005).  Nutt et al. (2005) showed that a bimetallic treatment 
approach involving palladium supported on gold increased the reaction rate in the 
dechlorination of TCE.  A rapid and complete dechlorination of chlorinated solvents with 
32 
 
(Cwiwrtny et al., 2006; Wang and Farrell, 2003) have been proposed to explain this 
phenomenon. 
Silicon is the second most abundant element following oxygen.  Silicon compounds are 
most often found in soil and groundwater environments.  In addition, zerovalent silicon 
(Si) has a lower redox potential (EH0 = -0.807 V) compared with iron (EH0 = -0.44 V).  
This indicates that Si can be used as a strong reductant for effectively reducing 
contaminants.  Our previous study (Doong et al., 2003) showed that Si reacts more 
efficiently than zerovalent iron (Fe) in the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride (CT) and 
PCE under anaerobic conditions.  More recently, the coupled reduction of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons and metal ions has attracted much attention (Doong et al., 2004; Lien et al., 
2007; Dries et al., 2005).  The low redox potential of zerovalent silicon can theoretically 
reduce metal ions such as Fe(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) to form zerovalent metals, and then the 
reduced metal species accelerate the dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons.  This gives the impetus to understand the synergistic effect of Si and metal 
ions on the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons under anoxic conditions.  
However, the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Si in the presence of metal 
ions has received less attention. 
In this study, the dechlorination of PCE by micro-scale Si in the presence of metal ions 
was investigated to understand the catalytic effect of bimetallic materials on PCE 
dechlorination under anaerobic conditions.  Three metal ions including Ni(II), Cu(II) and 
Fe(II) were selected as model second dopant metals.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) 
were used to characterize the change in surface microstructures of the Si.  In addition, the 
combination of various concentrations of Ni(II) with Si was examined to clarify the role of 
34 
 
into the silicon system to get the final concentrations of 8-32 μM.  The total volume of 
the liquid phase was 50 mL, resulting in a 70-mL headspace left for headspace analysis.  
The bottles were incubated in an orbital shaker (150 rpm) at 25 ± 1 °C in the dark.  
Control experiments were also carried out without the addition of zerovalent silicon or 
metal ions. 
2-2-3. Analytical Methods.  The headspace analytical technique was used for the 
determination of chlorinated hydrocarbons and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons.  The 
concentrations of PCE and the byproducts in the headspace of the test bottles were 
monitored by withdrawing 40 μL of gas in the headspace using a 50-μL gas-tight syringe.  
The headspace sample was immediately injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped 
with an electron capture detector (ECD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) 
(Perkin-Elmer, Autosystem, Norwark, CT). A 60-m VOCOL fused-silica megabore 
capillary column (0.545 mm × 3.0 μm, Supelco Co.) was employed to separate the organic 
compounds.  The column was connected to the FID and ECD simultaneously by a 
Y-splitter; and optimal sensitivity for chlorinated hydrocarbons was achieved with 40 % of 
the flow (1.85 ml min-1) to the ECD.  The column temperature was isothermally 
maintained at 120°C using ultra-high-purity nitrogen (> 99.9995%) as the carrier gas.  
The temperatures of the ECD and FID were maintained at 350 and 250 °C, respectively.  
The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the ECD analyses were within 10% and those 
for the FID analyses were within 5%.  Control samples were also used to check for the 
possible leakage of target compounds during the incubation process.  In addition, 
concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in aqueous solutions were calculated using the 
external standard method by preparing the known concentrations of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons in aqueous solutions. 
36 
 
Concentrations of dissolved metal ions in aqueous solutions were determined by the 
inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Perkin-Elmer, 
Optima 3000XL).  One ml of aqueous solutions in heterogeneous system was withdrawn 
using a N2-purged syringe and filtered through 0.45 μm filter (Millipore Co.) to remove 
particles.  The filtered solutions were then acidified using concentrated nitric acid to yield 
pH < 2, and heavy metals including Fe, Cu and Ni were analyzed using ICP-OES.  The 
detection limits of Fe, Cu and Ni were 2.1, 28.2 and 14.7 ppb, respectively. 
 
2-3. Results and Discussion 
2-3-1. Effect of metal ions on dechlorination of PCE by Si.  The reaction of Si with 
water produces large amounts of hydrogen gas (Table 2-1), which may significantly 
influence the headspace analytical procedure of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  To minimize 
the interference of hydrogen gas on quantification of chlorinated hydrocarbons, the 
produced hydrogen gas in serum bottle was released after 12 h of incubation prior to the 
addition of metal ions.  After a 24-h equilibrium of metal ions with Si, the hydrogen gas 
was released again before the injection of the stock solution of PCE.  
Figure 2-1 shows the effect of 0.1 mM metal ions on the dechlorination of PCE by Si in 
the buffered solutions at pH 8.3.  80 % of the original PCE was dechlorinated by Si alone 
after 420 h of incubation.  Addition of 0.1 mM Cu(II) lowered the dechlorination 
efficiency of PCE and only 48 % of the original PCE was removed after 420 h.  A slight 
increase in the dechlorination efficiency (89%) of PCE was observed in the presence of 
Fe(II).  On the contrary, addition of Ni(II) significantly enhanced the efficiency and rate 
of PCE dechlorination.  A nearly complete dechlorination of PCE was achieved within

In the presence of Ni(II), TCE concentration increased in the first 70 h and then 
decreased with time, followed by the production of ethane (93 %) as the major product.  
The carbon mass balances of PCE dechlorination by Si in the presence of metal ions were 
in the range 84 - 98%.  In addition, TCE was rapidly dechlorinated to ethane by Si in the 
presence of Ni(II) (Figure 2-2).  These results clearly show that PCE would be 
dechlorinated to TCE by Si first, and then the produced TCE is rapidly converted to ethane 
in the presence of Ni(II).

we found that Cu(II) has little effect on enhancing the dechlorination rate of PCE by Si, 
presumably attributed to the formation of zerovalent Cu and silicon oxide.  The XPS 
spectra of Cu and Si species showed peaks at 932.5 eV, which can be assigned as 
zerovalent Cu, while only a broad Si(2p) peak at 103-105 eV appeared, suggesting that Si 
was oxidized to SiO2 (Figure 2-4).  Xie and Shang (2006) investigated the bromate 
reduction by Fe(0) with incorporation of copper ions and found that pure Cu(0), generated 
from the reduction of Cu(II) by Fe(0), was not an active electron donor to the bromate 
reduction reaction.  Lin et al. (2005) used nanoscale zerovalent copper on a cation resin to 
remove CT under anaerobic conditions.  They found that the surface-area-normalized rate 
constant for CT dechlorination was (2.1±0.1) × 10-2 lh-1m2, which is lower than that by 
nanoscale Fe (5.99 × 10-2 lh-1m2) (Xu et al., 2005).  In addition, our previous study 
(Doong et al., 2003) has demonstrated that Si is a superior reductant than Fe(0) in the 
dechlorination of CT and PCE.  This means that Si can react with Cu(II) to form Cu(0) 
and SiO2, resulting in the decrease in the efficiency and rate of PCE dechlorination.  
 Si0 + 2Cu2+ +2H2O → SiO2 + 2Cu0 + 4H+ E0 = + 1.142 V (2) 
44 
 
A slight enhancement in the dechlorination efficiency of PCE was observed when 0.1 
mM Fe(II) was added.  The pseudo-first-order rate constant for PCE dechlorination in the 
presence of Fe(II) was 0.0053 h-1, which is 1.5 times higher than that by Si alone.  
Different from Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions, Ni(II) was observed to accelerate the dechlorination 
rate of PCE.  The kobs for PCE dechlorination by Si in the presence of Ni(II) was 0.0145 
h-1, which is 3.8 times higher than that by Si alone.   In addition, the dechlorination 
pattern of PCE by Ni(II)/Si system is similar to that by Ni(0)/Si system, depicting that 
Ni(II) could be reduced to its metallic form by Si.   Several studies have depicted that 
some transition metal ions such Ni(II), Pd(II) and Pt(II) could be reduced to their metallic 
form by Fe(0) (Lin et al., 2004; Doong and Lai, 2006; Li and Zhang, 2006).  The standard 
reduction potential of Si is –0.807 V, which is lower than that of nickel (-0.250 V) and iron 
(-0.440 V).  Therefore, Si could serve as a strong reducing agent to reduce Ni(II) and 
Fe(II) to Ni(0) and Fe(0), respectively. 
 
Ni2+ + 2e- → Ni0 E0 = -0.250 V (2-3)

Si0 + 2Ni2+/Fe2+ +2H2O → SiO2 + 2Ni0/Fe0 + 4H+ E0 = + 0.557/0.367 V (2-6) 
 
2-3-3. Characterization of metal species.   To further understand the catalytic effect 
of metal ions, XPS was utilized to characterize the change in metal species onto the Si 
surface.  Figure 2-5 shows the XPS spectra of Ni and Fe species onto the Si surface under 
anoxic conditions.  The Ni(2p) spectrum after Ar sputtering for 3 min showed two peaks 
at binding energies of 853 and 870.4 eV, which can be assigned as the Ni0(2p3/2) and

 The XPS spectra for Fe/Si samples were slightly different from those for Ni/Si samples.  
The Fe(2p) spectra showed two peaks at the binding energies of 710.9 eV and 724.5 eV, 
demonstrating that the iron species was iron oxides.  After sputtering by Ar for 1.5 min to 
remove the surface layer, however, peaks at 707 and 720 eV appeared remarkably, which 
reveals the existence of zerovalent iron (Fe).  Previous studies (Li and Zhang, 2006; 2007) 
have demonstrated the core-shell structure of iron nanoparticles in water.  The shell in 
contact with water is in the form of iron oxyhydroxide, while the core remains metallic 
iron, which is consistent with the results of bimetallic Fe/Si system obtained in this study.

Several studies have addressed the effect of additive loadings toward the dechlorination 
efficiency of chlorinated hydrocarbons by Fe (Schrick et al., 2002; Nutt et al.,, 2005; 
Bransfield et al., 2006).  An optimal mass loading exists for a wide variety of bimetallic 
catalysts.  Tee et al. (2005) investigated the role of bimetallic Ni/Fe nanoparticles on the 
dechlorination of TCE.  A higher degradation rate of TCE was observed upon increasing 
the Ni loading from 2 to 25 wt%, and then the kobs decreased when greater Ni loading was 
added.  Moreover, Lin et al. (2004) reported that the dechlorination rate of TCE by 
bimetallic Ru/Fe increased as the Ru loading increased from 0.25 to 1.5 wt%.  A decrease 
in kobs was also observed when Ru loading increased to 2.0 wt%.  In this study, an 
optimal mass loading of Ni at 0.5 mM (1.5 wt%) was also obtained for PCE dechlorination 
by Si.  The possible explanation is that the addition of metal ions may increase the 
numbers of Ni nanoparticles on the surface of Si, thus enhancing the catalytic activity for 
50 
 
and PCE, and addition of Ni(II) was found to obviously alter the reaction pathway and 
product distribution of PCE by Si.

intermediate compounds when Ni(II) concentration is higher than 0.1 mM, 
hydrodechlorination may be the major reaction pathway for PCE dechlorination by Ni/Si.   
The PCE concentrations in the contaminated aquifers have been reported to be in the 
range 0.28–8.0 mg/L (Rivett et al., 2006; Barbaro and Neupane, 2006).  To understand 
the feasibility of using metal-deposited Si to dechlorinate various concentrations of PCE, 
the effect of initial PCE concentrations on the efficiency and rate of PCE dechlorination by 
Si in the presence of 0.5 mM Ni(II) was also examined.  Figure 2-9 shows the effect of 
initial concentration on the dechlorination of PCE and the initial dechlorination rate as a 
function of PCE concentration.  The removal efficiencies of PCE were in the range 
91–99.9 % after 100 h of reaction when the initial concentrations of PCE were in the range 
8–32 μM.  The kobs for PCE dechlorination decreased from 0.0533 h-1 at 8 μM to 0.0241 
h-1 at 32 μM.  Although the kobs decreased upon increasing the initial concentration of 
PCE, the initial dechlorination rates increased positively from 0.321 μM h-1 at 8 μM to 
0.658 μM h-1 at 24 μM and then leveled off to a plateau.  Arnold and Roberts (2000) 
investigated the pathways and kinetics of chlorinated ethylene reactions with Fe particles.  
They found that the kobs for PCE dechlorination decreased with increasing initial 
concentration, while the initial rate increased with the increase in initial concentration, 
which is in agreement with the results obtained in this study.   
54 
 
metal-deposited Si(0) could be a useful bimetallic material for dechlorination of 
chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated sites. 
The combined removal of organic pollutants and heavy metals has recently received 
great attention.  Our results also showed that Si could effectively reduce Ni(II) and Fe(II) 
ions in the concentration range 0.05–1 mM after 24 h of equilibrium (Table 2-2), 
suggesting the potential use of Si to treat mixtures of chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy 
metals at various concentrations.  In the contaminated aquifers, the Fe(II) can be as high 
as 1.4 – 3 mM (Rugge et al., 1998), while Ni(II) is an inorganic contaminant commonly 
found at contaminated sites (Riley et al., 1992).  It is also noted that the kobs for PCE 
dechlorination by Si in the presence of 0.1 mM Fe(II) and Ni(II) were 1.5–3.8 times higher 
than that by Si alone.  In addition, low input of Ni(II) concentration at mass loading of 
0.05 mM has been shown to be effective on enhancing the efficiency and rate of PCE 
dechlorination and changing the product distribution in the presence of Si.  This gives 
great impetus to coupled reduction of heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons by Si 
under anaerobic conditions.  Zerovalent silicon would adsorb metal ions such as nickel 
and ferrous iron first and then convert to the zerovalent forms via the electron transfer from 
Si.  This process would significantly accelerate the dechlorination rate of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons under anoxic conditions and would be helpful in facilitating the development 
of processes that could be useful for the enhanced degradation of co-contaminants for 
long-term performance.

Chapter 3. Concentration Effect of Copper Loading on the 
Reductive Dechlorination of Tetrachloroethylene by Zerovalent 
Silicon 
 
Abstract 
 The dechlorination of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) by zerovalent silicon (Si(0)) in the 
presence of low concentration of Cu(II) ion was investigated under anaerobic conditions. 
The mass loadings of Cu(II) in the Si(0)-H2O system were in the range 0.06–3 wt% (0.02–1 
mM).  In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron probe 
microanalysis (EPMA) were used to characterize the change in chemical species and 
distribution patterns of metals, respectively.  Results showed that the pre-incubation time 
of 3 d was needed to activate the reactive sites of Si(0) before the dechlorination of PCE.  
Addition of low concentration of Cu(II) at 0.06 wt% significantly enhanced the 
dechlorination of PCE, while high concentration of Cu(II) would occupy the reactive sites 
of Si(0), and subsequently decreased the dechlorination efficiency and rate of PCE.  The 
pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) for PCE dechlorination by 0.06 wt% Cu/Si was 0.028 
h-1, which was 2.8 times higher than that by Si(0) alone.  However, the kobs for PCE 
dechlorination decreased to 0.0016 h-1 when the loading of Cu(II) increased to 3 wt%.  
The EPMA results showed that the distribution of 0.06 wt% Cu on the Si(0) surface was 
homogeneous without any aggregation, which means that the maximum rate constant was 
observed before the total coverage of the active sites on the reductive metal by the catalytic 
metal layer.  The surface coverage of Cu to Si(0) can theoretically calculate by estimation 
of the lowest energy fcc(111) crystallographic orientation.  The calculated surface

Several bimetallic particles including Pd/Fe, Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe, Ag/Mg, and Ni/Si have 
been synthesized and employed to the reduction of a wide variety of priority pollutants 
including chlorinated hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenols, and chromate (Schrick et al., 
2002; Tee et al., 2005; Cwiertny et al., 2006; Patel and Suresh, 2006; 2008).  The 
bimetallic system can not only increase the dechlorination rate but also change the 
degradation pathway and types of end products, mainly from hydrogenolysis to 
hydrodechlorination (Lee and Doong, 2008).  In addition, the deposition of a catalytic 
second metal ion such as Ni, Pd, and Ag onto the surface of a reductive metal including Fe, 
Si, and Mg could enhance the dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons and prevent the formation of toxic products by dechlorinating the chlorinated 
hydrocarbons via hydrogen reduction rather than through electron transfer (Farrell et al., 
2000; Schrick et al., 2002; Patel and Suresh, 2008). Doong and Lai (2006) have depicted 
that PCE was catalytically dechlorinated via β-elimination to ethane and ethylene by 
palladized irons.  The carbon mass balances were in the range 78–98 %. Several 
parameters including mass loading, types of catalytic second metals, and pH significantly 
influence the dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinate hydrocarbons under anaerobic 
conditions.  In addition, the type of products obtained during the dechlorination reaction 
is dependent on the identity and mass loading of the second metal employed (Schrick et al., 
2002).  
Silicon is the second most abundant element following oxygen, and has been 
demonstrated to be a strong reductant for effective reduction of chlorinated hydrocarbons 
(Doong et al., 2003, 2004; Lee and Doong, 2008).  Doong et al. (2003) have shown that 
Si(0) reacted more efficiently than Fe(0) on the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride and 
PCE under anaerobic conditions.  The low redox potential of Si(0) can theoretically

zerovalent silicon (> 99.5 %) were purchased from Merck Co. (Darmstadt, Germany). 
Copper chloride (CuCl2.2H2O) (> 99%) was obtained from Riedel-de Haën Co. (Seelze, 
Germany). 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES buffer) (reagent 
grade) was purchased from Aldrich Co.  Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt 
(C26H18N2Na2O6S2, 90%) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).  All other 
chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification.  
The deoxygenated solutions were prepared with high-purity anoxic deionized water 
(Millipore Co., 18.3 MΩ cm) using a vacuum and N2 (> 99.9995%) purging system 
(Maithreepala and Doong, 2005). 
 
3-2-2. Dechlorination of PCE by bimetallic Cu/Si systems.  Experiments were 
conducted in batch-fed modes using serum bottles sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa 
and aluminium crimp caps.  N2-purged 120-mL serum bottles were filled with 50 mL of 
deoxygenated buffer solutions and 0.05g of Si(0). 50 mM HEPES buffer solution were 
used to control the pH at 7.8 or 8.0 in the Si(0)–H2O system.  After being capped with 
rubber septa and aluminium caps, serum bottles were purged with N2 gas immediately to 
maintain the anaerobic conditions.  The deoxygenated stock Cu(II) solution was delivered 
into serum bottles by gas-tight syringes to obtain the desired concentrations.  An aliquot 
of stock solutions of Cu(II) ion was delivered into serum bottles by a gas-tight syringe to 
obtain the final concentrations ranging between 0.06 and 3 wt%. After 24 h of equilibrium, 
the stock solution of PCE dissolved in deoxygenated methanol was introduced into the 
silicon system to get the final concentrations of 15 μM.  The total volume of the liquid 
phase was 50 mL, resulting in a 70-mL headspace left for headspace analysis.  The bottles

The aqueous Cu(I) concentration was determined using the bathocuproinedisulfonic 
acid method (Maithreepala and Doong, 2005).  One mL of aliquot was withdrawn by a 
1-mL N2-purged plastic syringe and immediately added into the mixture containing 1 mLof 
10 % tartrate solution and 0.5 mL of 1% bathocuproinedisulfonic acid solution.  After 30 
min of reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min.  The Cu(I) 
concentration in the supernatant was then determined by the colorimetric method at 483 
nm.  Standard solutions of Cu(I) were prepared using 10% hydroxylamine as a reductant 
to reduce the CuCl2 solutions. The detection limit of Cu(I) in aqueous solution was 0.1 
μM. 
 
3-2-4. Surface characterization. The XPS measurements were performed by an ESCA 
PHI 1600 photoelectron spectrometer (Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN) using Al 
Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV photon energy). The spherical capacitor analyzer with a 
multi-channel detector had a take-off angle of 70° related to the horizontal of the sample 
plane.  The data were recorded digitally, and all peak scans were signal averaged until an 
acceptable signal-to-noise ratio was obtained. During the data acquisition, the pressure in 
the sample chamber did not exceed 2.5 × 10-8 torr. The binding energies of the 
photoelectrons were determined under the assumption that carbon has a binding energy of 
284.8 eV.  
In addition, EPMA was performed using an electron probe X-ray microanalyzer 
(JEOL JXA-8200) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a beam current of 20 nA.  
The Kα line of Cu was measured on four wavelength-dispersive spectrometers to minimize 
beam damage to the sample.  In addition, the EPMA equipped with mapping facilities 
enables mapping the spatial distribution of element concentration on the substrate surface.

system.  A 94% of original PCE was dechlorinated to TCE within 164 h when Cu/Si was 
pre-incubated for 1 d.  The dechlorination efficiency and rate of PCE was enhanced when 
the pre-incubation time increased to 2–3 d under anaerobic conditions, and removal 
efficiencies of 89–92% were obtained within 118 h. In addition, the dechlorination of PCE 
followed the pseudo first-order kinetics with respect to the concentration of PCE and the 
pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs) for PCE dechlorination increased from 0.015 h-1 to 
0.022 h-1 when the pre-incubation time of Cu/Si increased from 24 to 72 h.

Figure 3-4.  The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) spectrum of Cu(2p) 
species in Cu-amended Si(0) solutions under anaerobic conditions. 
 
Previous studies have demonstrated that Cu(II) can be reduced to Cu(0) by Fe(0) or 
Si(0) (Xie and Shang, 2006; Lee and Doong, 2008).  Figure 3-4 shows the XPS spectra of 
Cu species.  Peaks centered at 932.5 and 952.5 eV, which can be assigned as zerovalent 
Cu, were clearly observed.  In addition, no Cu(I) concentration in aqueous solution was 
detected (< 0.1 μM), indicating that Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(0) by Si(0) (eq. (3-2)).  
However, zerovalent Cu is not an active electron donor for dechlorination reaction when 
compared with Fe(0) or Si(0).  Therefore, the low concentration of Cu(II) can serve as a 
70 
 
bimetallic system (Bransfield et al., 2006).  The surface area of Si increased from 1.39 to 
3.26 m2/g after the dechlorination in solution, which indicates that the activation process of 
Si(0) in weak alkaline solutions can not only remove the H-terminator bonding (Si-H) on 
Si surface but also increase the surface area of Si(0) (Zhou et al., 2001).  From eqs (1) and 
(2), both the reactions of Si with buffer solution and with Cu can convert Si(0) into SiO2.  
The XPS results (Figure 2) showed that ratio of Si(0) to SiO2 on the Si surface is around 
0.23 at pH 7.8.  This result was employed to calculate the surface coverage of Cu onto Si 
surface by combining the crystallographic orientation of lowest energy fcc(111) (He and 
Zhao, 2008).  It is estimated that the surface coverages of Cu (Ratom = 0.128 nm) onto the 
activated Si surface are about 43 % and 210 % when the loadings of Cu(II) are 0.06 and 3 
wt %, respectively.  The estimated surface coverage of Cu/Si system fully supports the 
hypothesis of monolayer surface coverage, indicating that the dechlorination rate was 
significantly enhanced when the surface coverage of Cu was lower than monolayer 
coverage on Si surface.  In contrast, the dechlorination rate was extremely inhibited when 
the activated Si surface was completely covered by reduced Cu species at 3 wt%.

Chapter 4. Dechlorination of Trichloroethylene by Ni/Fe 
Nanoparticles Immobilized in PEG/PVDF and PEG/nylon 66 
Membranes 
 
Abstract 
The highly reactive bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles immobilized in nylon 66 and 
PVDF membranes were synthesized and characterized for dechlorination of 
trichloroethylene (TCE) under anoxic conditions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
images and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) elemental maps showed that the 
distribution of Fe in nylon 66 membrane was uniform and the intensity of Ni layer was 
higher than that in PVDF membrane. The particle sizes of bimetallic Fe/Ni in PVDF and 
nylon 66 membranes were 81±12 and 55±14 nm with the Ni layers of 12±3 and 15±2 nm, 
respectively.  Low agglomeration of immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles in nylon 66 
membrane was observed, presumably attributed to the more multifunctional chelating 
groups in membrane. A rapid hydrodechlorination of TCE with ethane as the main end 
product was observed by the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles. The pseudo-first-order rate 
constants for TCE dechlorination were 6.44±0.32 and 1.66±0.08 h-1 for nylon 66 and 
PVDF membranes, respectively. In addition, the efficiency and rate of TCE dechlorination 
increased upon increasing the mass loading of Ni ranging between 2.5 and 20 wt%, and 
then decreased when further increased the Ni loading to 25 wt%. In addition, the stability 
and longevity of the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles was evaluated by repeatedly 
injecting TCE into the solutions. A rapid and complete dechlorination of TCE by trace 
amounts of Fe/Ni nanoparticles was observed after 16 cycles of injection within 10 d, 
74 
 
The addition of stabilizer or capping agent for stabilizing nanoparticles is one of the 
effective strategies for environmental application because of the less agglomeration of 
nanoparticles and protection of nanoparticles from oxidation (Xu and Bhattacharya, 2005). 
Various stabilizers including thiols, carboxylic acids, surfactants and polymers have been 
used to prevent agglomeration of nanoscale iron oxide and zerovalent metal particles 
(Cushing et al., 2004; Saleh et al., 2007). Schrick et al. (2004) used anionic support 
materials such as hydrophilic carbon and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as stabilizers to 
minimize the aggregation as well as to reduce the sticking coefficient of NZVI. He and 
Zhao (2005) synthesized palladized iron nanoparticles in the presence of starch under 
anoxic conditions. The starched nanoparticles remained suspended in water for days, while 
nonstarched iron particles agglomerated and precipitated within minutes. In addition He et 
al. (2007) developed a new strategy for stabilizing palladized iron (Fe/Pd) nanoparticles 
with sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) as a stabilizer. The complexation between 
carboxylate groups with metal ions and the intermolecular hydrogen bond between CMC 
and the iron particle surface were identified to be the major mechanisms for stabilizing 
bimetallic nanoparticles. 
Another strategy for enhancing the stability and reactivity of nanoparticles is the 
immobilization of nanoparticles on supports in the presence of polymers or co-polymers. 
The use of porous microfiltration membranes as the support is of great interest because of 
their open structures and large pore sizes (Xu and Bhattacharya, 2008).  Several 
techniques including coating, grafting, and blending have been used to modify membrane 
surfaces for various applications including heavy metal removal, reverse osmosis, and 
fuel-cell membrane technology (Iwata and Matsuda, 1988; Wang et al., 2002).  PAA has 
been widely used as the cross-linker to immobilize bimetallic nanoparticles in poly

4-2-1 Materials and chemicals.  Trichloroethylene (TCE) (> 99.8%, GC grade) and 
HEPES buffer (N-[2-Hydroxyethyl] piperazine-N’-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]) (C8H18N2O4S) 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Milwaukee, WI).  Nickel chloride (NiCl2.6H2O) 
and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4.7H2O) were obtained from Riedel-de Haën Co. (Seelze, 
Germany).  PVDF (13 mm, 0.45 µm pore size) and nylon 66 (47 mm, 0.45 µm pore size) 
membranes were obtained from Millipore and Supelco Co., respectively.  All other 
chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. 
Deoxygenated solutions were prepared with high-purity anoxic deionized water (Millipore, 
18.3 MΩ cm) by purging high-purity nitrogen gas (99.995%) in vacuum-sealed bottles. 
This process was repeated 4-5 times to remove trace amount of oxygen in the solution 
(Maithreepala and Doong, 2004; Doong and Lai, 2006). 
 
4.2.2. Synthesis of immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles on microfiltration membranes. The 
immobilization of bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles in different microfiltration membranes is 
shown in Figure 4-1. Two different microfiltration membranes including PVDF and nylon 
66 were used as the supports for immobilization. The coating solution was prepared by 
dissolving 0.38 M FeSO4⋅7H2O and 2 mM PEG in deoxygenated water.  Membranes were 
then dipped into a 200-mL coating solution for 10 min, followed by heating the 
membranes at 110 oC for 3 h for grafting PEG to the membranes. The ferrous ion in the 
PEG-containing membranes was then reduced to NZVI by soaking the membranes into a 
300-mL of 0.5 M NaBH4 solution for another 10 min. All solutions were prepared using 
78 
 
thermal-graft polymerization of PEG with PVDF membrane, and (c) thermal-graft 
polymerization of PEG and Nylon 66 membrane. 
 
The bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles were synthesized by dipping the Fe-containing 
memebranes into the solution containing 100 mM NiCl2⋅6H2O (Merck, Germany) for 10 
min, and then soaked with 0.5 M NaBH4 for another 10 min to form bimetallic Fe/Ni 
nanoparticles in microfiltration membranes. The membranes were then washed with 
ethanol twice, and were stored in methanol/ethanol/isopropanol (90/5/5, v/v/v) solution to 
prevent the oxidation. The total amounts of Fe in the PVDF and nylon 66 membranes, 
determined by atomic absorbance spectroscopy (PerkinElmer AA100), were 10.0 and 6.04 
mg, respectively, while the total amounts of Ni were 0.17 and 1.15 mg, respectively.   
 Solution phase of Fe/Ni nanoparticles in the absence of membrane were also 
synthesized by dissolving 0.2 M FeSO4⋅7H2O in bidistilled deionized water following by 
the dropwise addition of 0.5 M NaBH4. A black precipitate was then obtained. The 
precipitate was washed with ethanol and stored in organic solvent as mentioned earlier. 
The suspended bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles were synthesized by adding 0.01 M 
NiCl2⋅6H2O and 0.5 M NaBH4 in solutions.  
 
4.2.3. Dechlorination of TCE by immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles. The dechlorination 
of TCE by immobilized bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles were investigated using 40-mL 
serum bottles sealed with Teflon-lined rubber septa and aluminum crimp caps. One nylon 
66 membrane (47 mm) or five PVDF membranes (13 mm) were cut into strips and loaded 
into a 20-mL deoxygenated HEPES buffer at pH 7.2 ± 0.1. After being capped with rubber 
80 
 
solutions were calculated using the external standard method by preparing the known 
concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons in aqueous solutions. 
 Concentrations of HCl-extractable Fe(II) in the serum bottles after dechlorination 
were determined by withdrawing 0.5 mL of solutions using N2-purged syringes, and were 
immediately acidified with 1 M HCl.  The acidified samples were centrifuged at 14,000 g 
for 10 min to remove solids and then the acid-extractable Fe(II) contents were analyzed 
using the ferrozine method at 562 nm (Stookey, 1970).  
The surface morphology of the microfiltration membranes containing bimetallic Fe/Ni 
nanoparticles was determined by SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F OXFORD INCA ENERGY 
400). All the samples were Pt-coated using Ion Sputter ε-1030 (Hitachi, Japan) to increase 
the conductivity of the sample surface. After coating with Pt, samples were placed under 
high vacuum (10-3–10-7 mbar) conditions. An acceleration electron voltage of 5k was 
applied to obtain the SEM images. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of the 
dispersed and membrane-immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles were measured by BET N2 
adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020). In addition, the surface areas of blank 
membranes were determined. The active surface areas of Fe/Ni nanoparticles in 
membranes were calculated from the difference in surface area between blank and 
immobilized membranes. 
EPMA was performed using an electron probe X-ray microanalyzer (JEOL JXA-8200) 
with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a beam current of 20 nA. The Kα lines of Fe and 
Ni was measured on four wavelength-dispersive spectrometers to minimize beam damage 
to the sample.  Iron and nickel metal was used as the standard for Fe and Ni 
determination.

4.3.2. TCE dechlorination by immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles.  Figure 4-5 shows the 
reactivity of Fe/Ni nanoparticles toward TCE dechlorination under anoxic conditions. 98% 
of the original TCE was dechlorinated by 50.8 mg Fe/Ni nanoparticles immobilized in 
PVDF membranes after the incubation of 120 min. On the contrary, the Fe/Ni 
nanoparticles immobilized in nylon 66 membranes (7.2 mg) exhibited a high reactivity 
toward TCE dechlorination, and a nearly complete dechlorination of TCE was achieved 
within 25 min. Ethane was found to be the major degradation product, and the carbon mass 
balances of TCE dechlorination was 93%, which indicates that hydrodechlorination is the 
major reaction pathway for TCE dechlorination by the membrane-immobilized Fe/Ni 
nanoparticles.

nylon 66 membrane, resulting in generation of more active reaction sites for 
hydrodechlorination of TCE (Zhang et al., 1998; Schrick et al., 2002).  This phenomenon 
can be supported by EDS and EPMA results. As depicted in Figure 3, the EDS analysis 
demonstrated that the weight percentages of Fe in nylon 66 and PVDF membranes were 
similar (44-46%).  However, the catalytic Ni content (26%) in nylon 66 was higher than 
that in PVDF membrane (7.5%), which is in good agreement with the distribution of 
catalytic nanoparticles in membranes obtained from EPMA analysis. In addition, the 
dechlorination rate of TCE by Fe/Ni nanoparticles immobilized in nylon 66 membrane was 
6 and 16 times higher than those by aqueous Fe/Ni (1.26 h-1) and Fe only (0.12 h-1) in the 
absence of membranes, respectively, when similar mass of nanoparticles was employed.  
This result indicates that the immobilized bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles have a higher 
reactivity than aqueous Fe/Ni nanoparticles towards TCE dechlorination.   
The reduction of contaminants by zerovalent metals appears to be a surface-mediated 
reaction and is first-order in relation to the amount of available metal surface area (Johnson 
et al., 1996; Clark et al., 2003). Therefore, the surface-normalized reaction rate constant 
(kSA) (L h-1 m-2) is usually used to compare the reaction ability of nanoparticles with the 
literature data. In this study, the calculated kSA values for TCE dechlorination by Fe/Ni 
nanoparticles in nylon 66 and PVDF membranes were 1.46 ± 0.07 and (6.8 ± 0.03) × 10-2 l 
h-1 m-2, respectively, which is higher than or similar to the reported vale of 9.8 × 10-2 L h-1 
m-2 by aqueous phase bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles (Doong et al., 2003). In addition, 
Mayer et al. (2004) used the Fe/Ni nanoparticles immobilized in a cellulose acetate domain 
for the dechlorination of TCE, and the kSA for TCE dechlorination was 3.7 × 10-2 L h-1 m-2 
when 24-nm Fe/Ni nanoparticles were employed for TCE dechlorination. These results

4-3-4. Stability and durability. In order to investigate the stability and possible 
long-term performance of immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles on the dechlorination of TCE, 
10 μM TCE were repeatedly injected into the 20 mL solutions containing 7.2 mg Fe/Ni in 
nylon 66 membrane. Figure 4-7 shows the stability and longevity of membrane-based 
Fe/Ni nanoparticles with repeated spiking of TCE.  For each spike, TCE concentration in 
the solution was raised from approximately zero to 10 μM TCE by introducing stock 
solution of TCE. A fast initial process of TCE dechlorination was observed throughout the 
first 11 cycles, depicting that spiked TCE was dechlorinated with the similar reaction rate 
(6.88-6.94 h-1). After the first eleven cycles of spiking, the nylon 66 membranes containing

In this study, we have demonstrated a simple approach for immobilization of 
bimetallic Fe/Ni nanoparticles in the different microfiltration membranes using thermal 
grafting polymerization in the presence of PEG. The Fe/Ni nanoparticles were uniformly 
immobilized in membranes with prevention of particle agglomeration. The nylon 66 
membrane was found to be the more efficient support than PDVF membrane for TCE 
hydrodechlorination because of high multifunctional chelating sites which can reduce 
agglomeration and retain high Ni content of Fe/Ni nanoparticles. A complete degradation 
of TCE was achieved within 25 min by immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles in nylon 66 
membrane with ethane as the main product. The reaction followed the pseudo-first-order 
rate kinetics and the rate constants increased upon increasing reaction temperature as well 
as mass loading of Ni at 2.5-20 wt%. In addition, the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles can 
retain the high reactivity after 16 cycles of injection within 10 d.   Results obtained in 
this study clearly depict that the immobilized Fe/Ni nanoparticles in microfiltration 
membranes can serve as an environmentally friendly reductant for the enhanced 
dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons for long-term performance.

nanocomposites were significantly enhanced in the presence of nickel ion under 
illumination of UV light at 365 nm. The kobs for TCE dechlorination increased 6.0-9.2 
times when Fe/TiO2 was illuminated with UV light for 1 h in the presence of nickel ions.  
 
5-1. Introduction 
Chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene (TCE) are 
one of the most prevalent contaminants in the environments and are released into the 
aquatic environments through the improper treatment and disposal.  These chemicals are 
known to have potential threats to the environment and human beings.  It is therefore of 
importance to develop effective treatment technologies to reduce the potential risk of these 
toxic chemicals in the environment.  Several treatment methods including physical, 
chemical and biological methods have been demonstrated to be effective on the removal of 
chlorinated compounds (Hung et al., 2007).  Among the methods used for treatment, 
zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been successfully employed for the treatment of various 
contaminants including a large variety of organic and inorganic compounds such as 
chlorinated hydrocarbons, nitroaromatics, arsenic and chromate (Zhang, 2003; Phenrat et 
al., 2007; Gisduddin et al., 2007). 
The fabrication of nanocomposites for degradation of priority pollutants has recently 
received considerable attention (Nutt et al., 2005; Hsueh et al., 2006).  Bimetallic 
materials including Pd/Fe, Ni/Fe, Cu/Al and Ni/Si have been found to be effective on 
reduction of a wide variety of priority pollutants including chlorinated hydrocarbons (He 
and Zhao, 2008; Tee et sl., 2005; Feng and Lim, 2005), pentachlorophenol (Patel and 
Suresh, 2008) and anions (Xie and Shang, 2006). In addition, the immobilization of 
zerovalent iron onto a support for stabilizing nanoparticles is another strategy for 
enhancing the dechlorination efficiency and rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons under anoxic 
96 
 
photodegradation efficiency of azo dye under the illumination of UV light.  However, the 
dechlorination ability of Fe/TiO2 has not been evaluated.  In addition, the effect of metal 
ion on the dechlorination as well as photodegradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons by 
Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites remains unclear.  
In this study, the combination of NZVI and Degussa P-25 TiO2 nanoparticles has been 
prepared for effectively removal of TCE in the presence of nickel ion under anoxic 
conditions.  A simple reduction method was used to fabricate Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites by 
addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and sodium borohydride as the cross-linker and 
reducing agent, respectively.  The morphology, elemental distribution, and change in 
chemical species were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 
respectively. The Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites were then employed for dechlorination and 
photocatalytic degradation of TCE under anoxic conditions.  In addition, the influence of 
Ni loading on the removal rates of TCE in the absence and presence of UV light at 365 nm 
was evaluated.  
 
5-2. Materials and methods 
5-2-1. Chemicals. Trichloroethylene (TCE) (> 99.8%, GC grade), HEPES buffer 
(N-[2-Hydroxyethyl] piperazine-N’-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]) (C8H18N2SO4) and 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW 8400) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. 
(Milwaukee, WI).  Degussa P-25 titanium dioxide (TiO2), a mixture of 80 % anatase and 
20 % rutile, was obtained from Degussa Co.  Nickel chloride (NiCl2.6H2O) and ferrous 
sulfate (FeSO4.7H2O) were obtained from Riedel-de Haën Co. (Seelze, Germany).  All 
other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further 
98 
 
deoxygenated stock solutions of Ni(II) ion solution in the concentration range 20-100 μM 
were delivered into serum bottles by gas-tight syringes to obtain the desired concentrations. 
The bottles were incubated in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm and at 25 ± 1 °C in the dark.  
Control experiments were also preformed in the absence of Fe/TiO2 nanoparticles. All 
experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate and the average values were 
reported. 
5-2-4. Photodegradation of TCE.  The photocatalytic activity of Fe/TiO2 
nanocomposites towards TCE degradation was conducted by using batch reactor. High 
purity nitrogen gas was purged all the time to maintain anoxic conditions during the 
preparation of the photodegradation of TCE.  A 50-mL Pyrex serum bottle containing 20 
mL of HEPES buffer solution and 10 μM TCE in the presence and absence of Ni(II) was 
used. An 8 W mercury lamp was positioned within the central part of the photoreactor and 
cooling water was circulated through a Pyrex jacket surrounding the lamp.  After addition 
of Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites to the solution, the sample was sonicated for 20 min under 
anoxic conditions to obtain a good dispersion.  Immediately after the sonication, the light 
was turned on.   
5-2-5. Analysis of TCE and nonchlorinated hydrocarbons. The headspace analytical 
technique was used for the determination of chlorinated hydrocarbons and non-chlorinated 
hydrocarbons. Concentrations of TCE and the byproducts in the headspace of the test 
bottles were monitored by withdrawing 40 μL of gas in the headspace using a 50-μL 
gas-tight syringe. The headspace sample was immediately injected into a gas 
chromatograph (GC) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and a flame 
ionization detector (FID) (Perkin-Elmer, Autosystem, Norwark, CT). A 60-m VOCOL 
fused-silica megabore capillary column (0.545 mm × 3.0 μm, Supelco Co.) was employed 
100 
 
takeoff angle of 70° related to the horizontal plane of the sample. Data were recorded 
digitally, and all peak scans were signal averaged until an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio 
was obtained. During data acquisition, the pressure in the sample chamber maintained 
below 2.5 × 10-8 torr. The binding energies of the photoelectrons were determined under 
the assumption that carbon has a binding energy of 284.8 eV.   
The photo-generated free radicals from the photodegradation of TCE by Fe/TiO2 in the 
presence of 0-100 μM Ni ion and 8 mM 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was 
examined using an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer (Bruker, EMX-10, 
Germany) working at X-band frequency.  A 500W Xe lamp (Ushio Inc.) at major output 
wavelength of 365 nm was equipped to the sample cavity by lined optical fiber. 
Nitrogen-purging aqueous Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites containing TCE, nickel ion and DMPO 
was irradiated with UV light at room temperature. After illumination for 10 min, the 
spectra of trapped charges in solutions were recorded at room temperature.  The 
instrumental conditions were set at a center field of 3400–3510 G and a sweep width of 
200.0 G. The microwave frequency was 9.49–9.88 GHz with a power at 8.02 mV. 
 
5-3. Results and discussion 
5-3-1. Characteristics of Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites.  Figure 5-1 shows the SEM 
images of pristine Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles and Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites. The SEM 
images show that the particle size distribution of TiO2 was narrow and the average particle 
size was 25±5 nm.  After addition of ferrous ion and NaBH4, the ZVI nanoparticles at 
60±5 nm were found, and TiO2 nanoparticles were embedded on the surface of ZVI to 
form Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites. The EDS analysis from SEM images clearly showed peaks 
102 
 
Ti distribution was higher than that of Fe, presumably attributed to that the TiO2 was 
deposited on the surface of NZVI, which is in good agreement with the EDS results. These 
results clearly depict that the distribution of Fe and Ti inside Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites was 
uniform with little aggregation, which allows good accessibility of the contaminants to 
Fe/TiO2 system during dechlorination reaction.

The XPS spectra of Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites were further examined to understand the 
change in chemical species.  As depicted in Figure 5-3, the Ti2p photoelectron spectra 
show peaks of Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 at 459.1 and 465.0 eV, respectively.  The doublet 
separation between the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks was found to be 5.8 eV, which is a

sites for dechlorination.  In addition, several studies have depicted that the reduction of 
contaminants by NZVI appears to be a surface-mediated reaction and is first-order in 
relation to the amount of available metal surface area (Clsrk et al., 2003; Doong et al., 
2006).  Therefore, the normalized surface reaction rate constant, kSA (L m-2 h-1), can be 
determined using the following equation: 
 
                  aSAobs kk ρ=  (5-2) 
where ρa is the surface area concentration of nanomaterial (m2 L-1).  The specific surface 
area of TiO2, NZVI and Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites were determined to be 48, 35 and 60 
m2/g, respectively.  Since Degussa P-25 TiO2 has no effect on dechlorination of TCE 
(Figure 5-4), the active surface area of Fe/TiO2 can be estimated from the subtraction of 
the surface area of Fe/TiO2 from that of pure TiO2, and a value of 22 m2/g was obtained.  
The kSA values for TCE dechlorination by NZVI and Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites were 
3.3×10-3 and 8.4×10-3 L m-2 h-1, respectively, clearly showing that the dechlorination rate 
of TCE by Fe/TiO2 nanoparticles is 2.6 times higher than that by NZVI alone.  In addition, 
this value is also higher than those reported in the literatures (0.48–2.0×10-3 L m-2 h-1) (Tee 
et al., 2005; Schrick et al., 2002), clearly showing that Fe/TiO2 is an effective reducing 
agent for dechlorination of TCE in the dark under anoxic conditions. This is also the first 
report on the enhanced dechlorination of chlorinated compounds by Fe/TiO2 
nanocomposites not involving photolysis.  
 
5-3-3. Effect of Ni(II) ion. Although Fe/TiO2 is effective on the removal of TCE under 
anoxic conditions, the reactivity of the nanocomposites is highly controlled by the surface 
characteristics and nature of contaminants.  The deposition of small amounts of second 
108 
 
 
 Figure 5-5 shows the dechlorination rate of TCE by Fe/TiO2 as a function of Ni(II) 
concentration in the dark under anoxic conditions.  Addition of Ni(II) has a significant 
effect on the enhancement of TCE dechlorination, and the dechlorination efficiency and 
rate of TCE increased upon increasing Ni(II) concentrations.  The kobs for TCE 
dechlorination by Fe/TiO2 increased from (1.3±0.1)×10-2 h-1 at 20 μM (r2 = 0.91) to 
1.29±0.06 h-1 at 100 μM (r2 = 0.97). These values are, in general, 1-2 orders of magnitude 
higher than that in the absence of Ni(II), clearly depicting that addition of Ni(II) has a 
synergistic effect on dechlorination of TCE by Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites.  This may be 
attributed to the high catalytic capability of Fe/TiO2 in dehydrogenation reaction. In 
bimetallic Ni/Fe systems, iron acts as the reductant for water and Ni serves as a catalyst to 
prevent the formation of toxic byproducts by dehalogenating chlorinated compounds via 
hydrogen reduction rather than via electron transfer (Li and Farrell, 2001; Schrick et al., 
2004).  
5-3-4. Photo-enhanced dechlorination of TCE by Fe/TiO2 in the presence Ni(II). 
One of the advantages of Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites is the photocatalytic activity towards 
organic degradation. In this study, the photocatalytic activity of Fe/TiO2 nanoparticles 
towards TCE in the presence of Ni(II) ions was further evaluated.  As depicted in Figure 
5-6, no obvious photodegradation of TCE was observed in the absence and presence of 
Fe/TiO2 under illumination of UV light within 60 min. On the contrary, addition of Ni(II) 
significantly enhance the dechlorination of TCE by Fe/TiO2 under the illumination of UV 
light at 365 nm. A 52% of original TCE was dechlorinated within 60 min when 20 μM 
Ni(II) was added in the presence of UV light.  A nearly complete dechlorination of TCE 
by Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites was observed when Ni(II) concentrations were higher than 50

Figure 5-8 shows the change in the intensity of the EPR signals of free radicals

produced six-line SPR spectra after 10 min of UV light irradiation, revealing the formation 
of O-centered radical adducts such as •OH, •OOH, and ROO• (Brezova et al., 2007; 
Dikslov and Mason, 1999).  The EPR signal of the radical spin adducts was very weak 
when no Ni2+ was added to the photoreaction of TCE by Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites.  The 
signal intensity of free radical increased significantly upon increasing aqueous nickel ion

In the present study, we have first demonstrated the rapid dechlorination and 
photodegradation of TCE by Fe/TiO2 nanocomposites in the presence of nickel ions and 
UV light under anoxic conditions. The nanoscale Fe/TiO2 was synthesized by one-pot 
simple reduction method for dechlorination of TCE in the presence of nickel ions. Surface 
analyses indicate that the NZVI and TiO2 were homogeneously dispersed in the

工業可能的材料與應用技術的發展與商業化可能性。 
大會於十八日開始進行報告註冊，並於晚上舉辦餐會，讓先到的與會者能先行認
materials)等七大主題，分為六個議場進行論文的發表。另外，會場大廳處則設置約
100 篇海報看版，於第二天下午(10/20)3:30-4:30pm 進行海報論文的展示與討論。 
新穎奈米材料的開發與應用已成為多數研究領域及學門的重點，本次會議的重點
之一即是討論新穎奈米材料的開發與其在能源上的應用，而此次參加會議的專家學
者背景即相當多樣，例如在此次會議中，除化學相關領域的專家學者外，許多領域
背景的專家學者，如化學工程、機械工程、物理系、材料科學與工程及藥學系等，
都參與此會議。由於應用主要以能源導向為主，所使用的奈米材料的選擇相當廣泛，
常見的奈米結構如奈米顆粒、奈米管、奈米線、及奈米纖維等，都是此次會議的主
題。其中碳材的開發與應用在本次會議中即有相當多的論文發表。德國 Max Planck 
Institute 的 K. Műllen 以＂Is the future black＂為題，作了一場相當精采的大會演講，
並將演講的內容著重在 graphene 的合成與應用上，graphene 為單層碳原子之二維晶
格結構，由於有相當高的 sp2鍵結，電子在室溫下可相當自由地傳遞，因此在近年來
相當在電子與能源材料的應用上相當受到重視，Műllen 教授利用 dendritic 方法，配
合 polyphenylene 及 benzene 為單體，可以合成出相當好的 graphene，再添加 Co 奈米
顆粒後，可作為鋰離子電池材料，其比電容量經反覆充放電後可達 400 mAh/g。澳洲
Wollongong 大學超導及電子材料研究所 G. Wang 教授也針對 Graphene 的合成、鑑定
與應用進行報告，Wang 教授利用 Hummer 方法，將 graphite 顆粒氧化成 graphene 氧
化物，再經還原作用即可形成 graphene。此材料可再繼續進行不同官能基的表面改
質，例如利用 poly(sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS)，可進行π-π交互作用，使 graphene
在 DMF 中的溶解度增加至 0.69 mg/mL，而利用 octylamine 進行表面改質後，graphene
的水溶解可增加至 2.35 mg/mL。另在能源工業上的應用，graphene 可摻雜 SnO2或 Sn
金屬作為鋰離子電池的陽極，單純利用 Sn 或 graphene 作為陽極材料，比電容量僅有
25 及 450 mAh/g，在添加 SnO2奈米顆粒後，Graphene 材料經 100 次充放電實驗後，
比電容量可達 600 mAh/g，而添加 Sn 金屬顆粒則可大於 600 mAh/g，顯示 graphene
為相當優異的電極材料。 
除 graphene 的優異特性可作為鋰離子電池之材料外，本次會議也有許多論文著
重於開發新穎材料以應用於鋰離子電池。許多材料包括 LiCoO2、LiMnO2 及 LiFeO4
均可作為鋰離子電池的陰極(cathode)，其中 LiFeO4 具有低毒性、價廉及高安全性的
次充放電後 K/Mn 的比值雖降至 0.11，但在第二次的充放電反應後，K/Mn 即回昇至
0.27，顯示 K 離子可自由進出陰極材料的層狀結構中，經 100 次重複充放電後，電容
量也可維持在 40 F g-1間。武漢大學材料科學與工程學院 W. Chen 教授則合成新穎的
中孔洞碳材電極材料，Chen 教授利用硬模板方式，配合 resorcinol 及 F127 作為碳前
趨物，在甲醛存在下，以 50-80 °C、4 小時的反應時間合成中孔洞材料，之後在 800 °C
氮氣下鍛燒碳化，即可得到中孔洞碳材，經特性鑑定發現，所合成的碳材表面積可
達 1000 m2/g 以上，粒徑大小則約為 3.8 nm。利用此材料作為陽極材料，經 200 次循
環，其伏安循環(cyclic voltammetry, CV)圖形仍相當一致，各曲線仍幾乎重疊在一起。
而作為電容材料時，在 1 mA cm-2的電流密度下，比電容量可達 114.5 F cm-1，即使電
流密度昇至 10 mA cm-2後，比電容量可達 77 F cm-1，此些數值均大於活性碳的 55-100 
F g-1，也說明中孔洞碳材具有相當大發展潛能。 
本次會議另一項重點就是有相當多新穎的奈米材料，台灣大學化學系劉如熹教授
整理近年來的研究成果，針對不同型態的金奈米材料及金銀合金材料作一個相當有
系統的整理介紹，同時也說明了各種型態的金奈米材料的製備技術與可能應用。英
國 St. Andrews大學化學系周午縱(W. Z. Zhou)教授則針對陽極氧化製備之二氧化鈦奈
米管陣列的形成機制進行一全面性的說明，並藉由 equifield strength model, field 
enhanced dissociation of water and nano-convection model 三種反應機制說明二氧化鈦
奈米管陣列形成之微結構與型態改變。印度 Calcutta 大學 A.H.K. Patra 博士利用金奈
米顆粒來瞭解生物體攝食奈米顆粒的情形，發現50 nm的金奈米顆粒比小粒徑(14 nm)
或大粒徑(74 nm)的金奈米顆粒更具穿透力。金奈米顆粒在生物體表面時會聚集在接
近細胞核的某些特性區域，而不是簡單的僅進行擴散作用(diffusion)。一旦進入生物
體的奈米顆粒則會誘導細胞型態的改變。另新加坡國立大學物理系蘇重豪(C.H. Sow)
教授則作了一場相當精采的演講，他利用簡單的加熱反應，將金屬塊至於傳統加熱
板上，在 300-450 °C 於固定時間加熱後，即可得到結構相當漂亮的一維奈米結構，
例如在 400 °C、 1 小時的反應條件下可得到 CuO 奈米桿，而 350°C、 12 小時的反
應條件下可得到 Co3O4 奈米牆(nanowall)，480°C 的反應條件則可得到 MoO3 奈米帶
(nanobelt)。此法具有簡單、大規模及量產的特色，而且初投資費用相當低廉，操作
成本也不高，實為一相當可行的量產奈米技術。
