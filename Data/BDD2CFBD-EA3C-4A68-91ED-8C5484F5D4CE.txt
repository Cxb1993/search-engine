Abstract 
Process capability indices, which provide numerical measures on whether a process 
meets the capability requirement present in the factory, have popularly applied to the 
industry for evaluating manufacturing performance. Although process yield is the 
primary focus of the performance criteria, a new formula combining the yield and the 
average process loss, called the quality yield index, has been developed. The new 
index, quality yield, could be viewed as the conventional process yield minus the 
truncated expected relative process loss within the specifications. Although cases with 
symmetric tolerances are common in practical situations, cases with asymmetric 
tolerances often occur in the manufacturing industry. In this paper, we generalize the 
quality yield index for asymmetric tolerances. The merit of the generalization is 
justified, and some statistical properties of the estimated generalization are 
investigated. An application example on high density Light Emitting Diode (LED) is 
also presented for illustrating the applicability of the generalization.

Loss Measure 
To remedy this, Johnson (1992) developed so called the relative expected loss 
eL  for symmetric case, which is defined as the ratio of the expected quadratic loss to 
the square of the half specification width: 
2 2

( )σ µ+ −=e TL d ,                         (6) 
where ( ) / 2= −d USL LSL  is the half specification width. This measure has a direct 
relationship with pmC  because eL =
2(3 )−pmC . The advantage of eL  over pmC  is 
that the estimator of the former has better statistical properties than that of the latter, 
as the former does not involve a reciprocal transformation of process mean and 
variance. The disadvantage of eL  index is the difficulty in setting a standard for the 
measure since its value ranges from zero to infinity. 
Quality Yield Measure 
Tsui (1997) proposed the quality yield index to incorporate the average process 
loss with the conventional yield measure. The quality yield index, which has been 
referred to as Q-yield and denoted by qY  is defined as:

A process is said to have a symmetric tolerance if the target value T is set to be 
the midpoint of the specification interval [LSL, USL], i.e. T = M = (USL + LSL)/2. 
Most research in quality assurance literature is focused on cases in which the 
manufacturing tolerance is symmetric. Examples include Kane (1986), Chan et al. 
(1988), Choi and Owen (1990), Boyles (1991), Pearn et al. (1992), Vännman (1995), 
Vännman and Kotz (1995), and Spiring (1997). Although cases with symmetric 
tolerances are common in practical situations, cases with asymmetric tolerances often 
occur in the manufacturing industry. 
In general, asymmetric tolerances simply reflect that deviations from the target 
value are less tolerable in one direction than the other (see Boyles (1994), Vännman 
(1997), and Wu and Tang (1998)). Asymmetric tolerances can also arise from a 
situation where the tolerances are symmetric to begin with, but the process follows a 
non-normal distribution and the data are transformed to achieve approximate 
normality, as shown by Chou et al. (1998) who have used Johnson curves to transform 
non-normal process data. Unfortunately, there has been comparatively little research 
published on cases with asymmetric tolerances. Exceptions are Boyles (1994), 
Vännman (1997), Chen (1998), Pearn et al. (1998, 1999), and Chen et al. (1999). 
In this paper, we consider the quality yield index for processes with asymmetric 
tolerances. We consider an asymmetric loss function, and the corresponding truncated 
worth function to generalize the quality yield index. Comparisons among the yield, 
the quality yield, and some popular process capability indices are examined. 
Distributional properties of the estimated qY  are also investigated. A confidence 
interval for qY  is constructed to estimate the manufacturing capability. Finally, an

Figure 1 displays the plot of ( )L x  for a process with asymmetric manufacturing 
specification (LSL, T, USL) = (10, 40, 50). Figure 2 displays the plot of ( )W x  for a 
process with asymmetric tolerance (LSL, T, USL) = (10, 40, 50). Now, using the worth 
function, we can distinguish the worth of the products that fall inside of the 
specification limits.  
Consider two items 1x  and 2x  with 1x >T and 2x <T, satisfying the 
relationship 1 2( ) / ( ) /− = −u lx T d T x d  (equal departure ratios). In this case, the worth 
values given to items 1x  and 2x  are the same. For example, we note that for the 
midpoint of the left-hand side tolerance, 1 ( ) / 2= +x T LSL  and the midpoint of the 
right-hand side tolerance, 2 ( ) / 2= +x T USL , the corresponding worth can be 
calculated as:

2 2
2 2( ) 1 [( ) / ] 1 {[(( ) / 2) ] /( )} 3 / 4= − − = − + − − =uW x x T d T USL T USL T . 
Obviously, the two points 1x  and 2x  have the same departure ratio (relative 
departure) 1 2( ) / ( ) / 1/ 2= − = − =l uk T x d x T d . Checking process loss at 1x  and 2x , 
we have 1 2( ) ( ) 1/ 4= =L x L x  and equal worth value 3/4. In fact, 0 < ( ) 1<W x  for 
LSL < x < USL and ( ) 1=W T . On the other hand, ( ) 0=W x  if x falls outside the 
specification limits.

This quality yield index differs from the expected relative worth index defined in 
Johnson (1992) by truncating the deviation outside the specifications. With this 
truncation, the quality yield index will be between zero and one and, thus provides a 
standardized measure. Also, by relating to the yield measure, which is widely 
accepted in the manufacturing industry, it will be better understood and accepted as a 
capability measure. The advantage of the qY  index over the eL  index is the value of 
the former goes from zero to one. Similar to the yield index Y, an ideal value of qY  is 
one, which provides the user a clear guide about the standard. Similarly to the yield Y, 
the yield index qY  requires no normality assumption. 
To illustrate some basic behavior of quality yield qY  versus normal distribution 
with various application cases, we consider the following parameter settings as listed 
in Tables 1-4. For a process with asymmetric tolerance (LSL, T, USL) = ( 3, 0, 4.5) (so 
that 3, 4.5= =l ud d ), five levels of qY , 0.5(0.1)0.9, are selected in each case. And 
cases studied are arranged in the following manner. In case 1, we set µ =T  and 
calculated the corresponding σ  for each qY  level. In cases 2-4, µ  is shifted from 
T toward USL by / 6ud , / 4ud , and / 3ud , respectively. We then solve for σ  in 
each setting. In cases 5-7, µ  is shifted from T toward LSL by / 6ld , / 4ld , and 
/ 3ld , respectively. We then solve for σ  in each case. Finally, in cases 8-10, σ  is 
fixed at three levels, 1/3, 1/2, and 1. The corresponding values of µ  in each setting 
have again been computed.

3. Comparison of Yield, Q-Yield, and PCIs 
To illustrate the basic differences among yield Y, quality yield qY , and the four 
well-known process capability indices pC , pkC , pmC  and pmkC , we compare the 
measured values based on the yield Y, quality yield qY , and the four indices on some 
processes. 
Comparison of Q-yield and Yield 
Both the Q-yield index and the conventional yield index can be applied to 
processes with any distribution. The conventional yield, however, does not 
distinguish the products falling inside the specification tolerance. For example, if X 
follows the uniform distribution ( , )U LSL USL  with target T where LSL < T < USL, 
then yield Y = 1.00 and Q-yield qY = 0.667, respectively. From manufacturing 
perspective all the produced units are good products, but certainly the consumer 
would consider the process low quality even although the yield Y = 1.00. To further 
demonstrate the difference between yield and Q-yield, we consider a set of triangular 
distributed processes with a < x < b and mode c. Table 5 displays the quality yield 
measure of those triangular distributed processes with modes c = 11(1)49, (a, b) = 
(LSL, USL) = (10, 50), and target value T = 30(5)45. For those processes, the yield 
values given to all processes are Y = 1.00. On the other hand, Q-yield obtains its 
maximum 0.833 not at µ =T  but at the mode =c T  for those triangular distributed 
processes. The plots of qY  versus mode c = 11(1)49 with T = 30(5)45 are displayed 
in Figure 7. The figure shows that qY  always attains the maximum 0.833 at the mode, 
as the target value moves from 30 to 45 by 5.

Figures 8-9 display the plots against µ  of qY , Y and four PCIs pC , pkC , pmC  
and pmkC , respectively. With fixed σ = 20/3, and (LSL, T, USL) = (10, 30, 50), µ  is 
varied from 10 to 50 by 1 to examine the sensitivity of these indices with respect to 
µ . For the symmetric case, all the six indices attain their maximum at µ = T = 30 as 
one can easily check in the plots. And as µ  departs from T, all (except pC ) 
decrease, as one may expect.  
Tables 8-9 demonstrate the comparisons among the six indices in normal 
processes for various values of µ  with fixed σ = 10/3, 20/3 respectively, and (LSL, 
T, USL) = (10, 40, 50). For the asymmetric case, with fixed σ = 10/3, and (LSL, T, 
USL) = (10, 40, 50), Figures 10-11 display the plots against µ  of qY , Y and four 
PCIs pC , pkC , pmC  and pmkC , respectively. Similarly, Figures 12-13 display the 
plots against µ  of qY , Y and four PCIs pC , pkC , pmC  and pmkC , respectively. 
Specification limits are set to (LSL, T, USL) = (10, 40, 50) and σ = 20/3 is fixed. In 
this setting, µ  is varied from 10 to 50 by 1 to examine the sensitivity of these 
indices with respect to µ , for processes with asymmetric tolerances.

knowledge of process distribution. But, if the distribution of the characteristic X is 
given with cumulative distribution function FX, then the cumulative distribution 
function of the corresponding worth WF  can be calculated, and the cumulative 
distribution function of qˆY  can be expressed as the n-fold convolution of WF :

where sample variance 2 2( ) /( 1)= − −∑ iS W W n . Consequently, an approximate 
(1 )100%α−  confidence interval of qY  can be established as: 
1 / 2
ˆ( / ,α−−qY z S n 1 / 2ˆ / )α−+qY z S n ,              (25) 
where 1 / 2α−z  is the (1 / 2)α−  quantile value of the standard normal distribution 
(0, 1)N . We note that a lower (1 )100%α−  confidence limit can be obtained from 
the lower (one-sided) confidence limit. If the calculated lower confidence limit is 
greater than the predetermined index value, then we would judge that the process is 
capable. Otherwise, the process is considered to be incapable, and some quality 
improvement activities must be initiated. 
Distribution Plot of the Q-yield Estimator 
Some Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to investigate the behavior of the 
sampling distribution of the estimated qY , for several selected cases, where the 
underlying process distributions are normal, skewed, or heavy tailed. True value of 
quality yield qY = 0.6 is picked, with underlying process distributions set to

We randomly generate N = 10,000 samples of sizes n = 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 
250, 300 for each distribution, then calculate the estimate value of qY  for each 
sample. Figures 14-21 plot the distribution of qˆY  for the eight levels of sample size 
with qY = 0.6, respectively. In each figure, five underlying process distributions 
including normal, lognormal, Student’s t, chi-square, and Weibull are drawn with 
fixed sample size in order to investigate how the sample size affects the distribution of 
qˆY . From those plots, one may observe that for moderate sample size n (about 100) 
the distributions of the estimated Q-yield index all appear quite close to normal. 
Therefore, for practical purpose, normal approximations may be used for capability 
testing of qY . 
6. An Application Example 
We consider a case study for illustration purpose. Application of LEDs is 
expanding rapidly since high intensity LEDs of wide range of colors have been 
recently developed and become available, making possible application of LEDs in a 
wide variety of areas such as instrument cluster lighting, color displays, traffic signals, 
 18
With a focus on the critical characteristic, the luminous intensity of LED sources, 
we examine a particular LED product model, with the upper and the lower 
specification limits of luminous intensity are set to USL = 90 mcd, LSL = 40 mcd, and 
the target value is set to T = 60 mcd. We note that it’s an asymmetric tolerances case. 
The LED is said to be defective if the characteristic data does not fall within the 
specification limits (LSL, USL). For the purpose of making use of the methodology 
more convenient and accelerate the computation, an integrated S-PLUS computer 
program is developed (available from the authors) to calculate the lower confidence 
bounds. We only need to input the manufacturing specification limits, USL, LSL, 
target value T, and the collected sample data of size n. Then the estimated values Yˆ , 
qˆY  and the lower confidence bounds of qˆY  may be obtained easily. Thus, whether or 
not the process is capable may be determined.

Figure 22. Histogram plot of the 
sample data of size n = 150.  
 
A total of 150 observations were collected from a stable process in the factory, 
which are displayed in Table 10. Figure 22 displays the histogram of the sample data. 
From Figures 22, it is evident from the density line that the underlying process 
distribution is far from normality. Refer to the distribution plots of the Q-yield 
estimator, a random sample of size n = 150 seems to be large enough to apply the 
normal approximation approach for capability testing of qY . Proceeding with the 
calculations by running the integrated S-PLUS program with 95% of confidence, we 
obtain the values of the sample estimator qˆY  = 0.8082 and the corresponding lower 
confidence bound (LCB) as 0.7768. We note that the estimated qˆY  index value is 
about 0.81. In fact, all 150 observations fall within the specification interval (LSL, 
USL) so that the sample estimator of yield is Yˆ = 1. From the producer’s point of 
view, the proportion of conforming products is 100%. However, to quantify how well 
a process can meet the customer requirement, the lower confidence bound of qˆY  is 
approximately equal to 0.78 can be interpreted as the satisfaction degree of the 
products, on the average, is at least 78% approximately, with 95% of confidence. 
From the corresponding lower confidence bound on qY , 0.7768, an example of 
capability testing is that if the Q-yield requirement preprint on the contract qY  is set 
to 0.78, we may only conclude that the process is marginally capable, with 95% 
confidence.
