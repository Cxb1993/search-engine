more accurately, and more information is provided for designing queueing systems. The 
successful extension of tandem queues to fuzzy environments permits tandem queueing 
models with blocking to have wider applications.

式等候線 (series queue, tandem queue, or sequential queue，如圖一所示) 問題常見
於電腦系統、通訊網路、生產線、彈性製造系統與服務系統中 [1-4]。至今已有一
些學者基於傳統的等候理論來分析串聯式等候系統，近期的研究如 Lee and Seo 
[5]、Huang 等人 [6]、Framinan 等人 [7]、Cohen 等人 [8]。在實際的環境中，串
聯式等候系統中站間多半涉及到受阻礙 (blocking) 的問題 [9]，也有一些學者是針
對受阻礙串聯式等候問題發展有效的分析方法，例如 Sawik [10,11] Vidalis 等人 
[12]、Nakade [13], Gómez-Corral [14,15]、Chang 與 Chen [16]、Boucherie與 van der 
Wal [17]、Li 等人 [18] 以及 Houdt與 Alfa [19]. 
上述研究多半基於顧客到達間隔時間與服務時間符合某些機率分配，然而，
許多實際問題之顧客到達與接受服務型態較適合以語意方式表現，例如「快」、「慢」
或「適中」，而較不適合以機率分配表示。因此若能將一般 (crisp) 等候問題擴充
為模糊等候 (fuzzy queue) 問題 [20] 並發展出解法，則等候模式之應用將更廣

INTRODUCTION 
Flow line systems with blocking are the common situations in the real life, such as pro-
duction/manufacturing lines, assembly lines, and cafeteria lines (Krajewski and Ritzman 
2005; Lapierre and Ruiz 2004; Sarker and Pan 2001; Stevenson 2002). A typical exam-
ple is a McDonald’s drive-through, where the first facility takes the order, the second 
one takes the money, and the third one provides the food. Clearly, capacity planning of 
systems of this kind is critical to the long-term success of an organization since it often 
involves important and irreversible decisions such as the determination of the amount of 
capacity level to handle uncertain and variable demands (Krajewski and Ritzman 2005). 
Many approaches have been developed for capacity planning in measuring perform-
ances of flow line systems with blocking, among which queueing models are proved to 
be effective and efficient tools for planning operations and service systems (Krajewski 
and Ritzman 2005). For example, in a high customer-contact process, managers can use 
the information of system performance measures evaluated via queueing models to 
choose the most-effective capacity, balancing customer service and the cost of adding 
capacity. 
In practice, most of the flow line systems with blocking can be modeled as multiple 
phase queueing models with limited buffers. Clearly, the precise and complete per-
formance analysis of the system of this kind is very important for designing the best 
layouts to achieve a smooth and rapid flow of large volumes of goods and customers 
through the system. When the input information of the flow line system with blocking, 
such as the arrival rate and service rate, are known exactly, efficient and effective 
methods have been developed for analysing the system. Recent studies include Lee and 
Seo (1998), Sawik (2000, 2002), Huang et al. (2002), Framinan et al. (2004), Vidalis et 
al. (2005), Cohen et al. (2006), and so on. They developed analysis methods based on 
probability theory, where the probability is expressed in terms of the statistical informa-
tion of its components, such as the arrival rates and service rates. One of commonly 
 12
On the basis of traditional queuing theory (Gross and Harris 1998), we can derive 
the system performance measures (e.g., the expected number of customers in the system 
and the expected sojourn time per customer) of the serial systems when their parameters 
are known exactly. However, there are cases that these parameters may not be presented 
in a precise manner due to some uncontrollable factors. Specifically, in many practical 
applications, the statistical data may be obtained subjectively; e.g., the arrival pattern 
and service pattern are more suitably described by linguistic terms rather than by prob-
ability distributions based on statistical theory. Imprecise information of this kind will 
undermine the quality of performance analyses through conventional series queueing 
models with blocking. To deal with imprecise information in making decision, Bellman 
and Zadeh (1970) and Zadeh (1978) introduced the concept of fuzziness. Today, fuzzy 
set theory is a well-known means for modelling imprecision or uncertainty arising from 
mental phenomena. Specifically, fuzzy queues have discussed by several researchers 
(for example, Buckley 1990; Buckley et al. 2001; Jo et al. 1996; Li and Lee 1989; Negi 
and Lee 1992; Prade 1980; Zhang and Phillis 2000; Zhang and Phillis 2001; Chen 2004, 
2005a, 2005b). 
Since the fuzzy serial system with limited buffers is more realistic than the conven-
tional serial system with limited buffers, it deserves further investigation. However, lit-
tle research has been published on the flow line problems with limited buffers or the 
fuzzy series queueing model with blocking. For example, Gen et al. (1996) and Tsuji-
mura et al. (1995) used the genetic algorithms to solve fuzzy assembly line balancing 
problems. Medaglia et al. (2002) proposed a simulation optimization approach that in-
corporated knowledge into the optimization strategy, which depends on a fuzzy control-
ler. They used the design of a flow line manufacturing system as an illustration. Chen 
(2005b) proposed an approach for analyzing the fuzzy tandem queue, however, only the 
case of non-blocking is investigated. Both of the problem investigated in this paper and 
the proposed approach are different from those of previous works. This paper differs 
FUZZY FLOW LINE MODEL WITH BLOCKING 
Without loss of generality, consider a two-station flow line system. The cases of multi-
ple-station systems can be generalized from this case. In this system, a customer arriv-
ing for service must go through two series stations, namely station 1 and station 2. Each 
station has a single server, and no queue is allowed to form at either station. If at the 
first station, an order has been taken but the second station is not free, the customer is 
always willing to wait and will not turn away. The customers arrive to the system from 
another system according to a Poisson process with a fuzzy arrival rate λ . The service 
times at stations 1 and 2 are exponential with fuzzy service rate β  each. Each station 
could be either busy or free. The system is said to be blocked if the customer in station 1 
completes service before station 2 becomes free. Arrivals at station 1 when the system is 
blocked are turned away. The director wants to investigate the performance analysis of 
the serial system. 
 
Model Description 
When arrival rates and service rates of the above system are crisp, this system is often 
analyzed effectively and efficiently via a two-station open series queueing model with 
blocking, specifically no queue is allowed to form at each station. Intuitively, if any of 
the parameters such as the arrival rate or service rates are fuzzy, the system perform-
ances become fuzzy as well. The model for analyzing this system then turns into the 
fuzzy series queueing model with blocking. 
Note that in the model the arrival rate λ  and service rate β  are imprecise and can 
be represented by the convex fuzzy sets (Zimmermann 2001): 
{( , ( )) | },x x xλλ µ= ∈X                       (1) 
{( , ( )) | },y y yββ µ= ∈Y                       (2)

and the blocking probability are 
 
2
2 ,3 4 2b
xP 2x xy y
= + +                (5) 
where the blocking probability is defined as the probability that a semi-finished product 
upon service completion at the first station will get blocked. Without loss of generality, 
suppose that the performance measure of interest is the expected number of 
semi-finished products in the system sL ; that is, ( , ) sp Lλ β =   . Therefore, following (3), 
the membership function of sL  is

.             (6) 
Although the membership function in (6) is theoretically correct, it is not in the usual 
form for practical use. 
The application of Zadeh’s extension principle to sL  may be viewed as the appli-
cation of this principle to the α -cut of sL  (Nguyen 1978). The α -cuts of λ  and β  
are crisp sets which can be represented as (Zimmermann 2001) 
L U[ , ] [min { | ( ) },max { | ( ) }]x xx x x x x xα α α λ λλ µ α µ α= = ∈ ≥ ∈ ≥X X 
]β

L U[ , ] [min { | ( ) },max { | ( ) }y yy y y y y yα α α ββ µ α µ α= = ∈ ≥ ∈ ≥Y Y  .      (8) 
Equations (7) and (8) indicate that the arrival rate and service rate can be represented by 
different levels of confidence intervals (Negi and Lee 1992). Thus, the fuzzy series 
queue with blocking can be decomposed into a family of crisp series queues with 
blocking and different arrival rates αλ  and service rate αβ , [0,1]α ∈ . 
To find the membership function ( )
sL
zµ  , it suffices to find the left shape function 
and the right shape function of ( )
sL
zµ  . This can be achieved via the following two 
steps. The first step is to find the lower bound L( )sL α  and the upper bound 
U( )sL α  of 
 16
Similar to Case 1, the requirement of ( )yβµ α=  can be replaced by Ly yα=  or 
Uy yα= , thus we could set ; and L U2 2 2(1 ) ,  0 or 1y t y t y tα α= + − = ( )xλµ α≥  can be 
replaced by L Ux x xα α≤ ≤ . According to the above discussion in Case 1, we can formu-
late another pair of parametric nonlinear programs to find lower and upper bounds of 
α -cuts of sL :

Models (9) to (12) are mixed integer nonlinear programs with 0-1 variables and 
bound constraints that can be solved by using effective and efficient integer nonlinear 
programming methods (Taha 1975). Consequently, considering the above two cases si-
multaneously, we set the lower bound  and the upper bound

U UU( ) max{( ) ,( ) }s sL L Lα α= α -cuts of sL . 
Note that all α -cuts of x and y form nested structures with respect to α  (Kauf-
mann 1975); that is, for two possibility levels 1α  and 2α  such that 10 12 ≤<< αα , 
we have

L U L U[ ,  ] [ ,  ]x x x xα α α α⊆  and . Therefore, the feasible re-

1 1 2 2

 18
fuzziness of parameters may not be a good thing for designing queueing systems. To 
tackle this problem, one way is to transform the fuzzy performance measure to crisp one. 
In this paper we adopt a simple fuzzy number ranking method to defuzzify the per-
formance measures into crisp ones. Many fuzzy ranking methods have been proposed, 
such as Yager (1981), Chen (1985), Choobineh and Li (1993), Fortemps and Roubens 
(1996), Chen and Klein (1997). As noted by Chen and Klein (1997), since most of the 
existing ranking methods are based on comparing partial order among fuzzy utilities, 
they fail to exhibit the consistency of human intuition. Fortemps and Roubens (1996) 
pointed that area compensation is a robust ranking technique that yields results consis-
tent with human intuition when comparing to other ranking methods. Since the Yager’s 
ranking index method possesses the property of area compensation, we adopt this 
method for transforming the fuzzy performance measures into crisp ones to provide 
suitable performance measures for designing flow-line systems. The representative per-
formance measure is calculated by: 
{ }1 L

[ ( , )] 0.5 [ ( , )] [ ( , )]UI p p pα dαλ β λ β λ β α= +∫      ,         (14) 
where L[ ( , )]p αλ β   and U[ ( , )]p αλ β   are the lower and upper bounds of the α -cut of 
( , )p λ β  , respectively. 
 
EXAMPLE 
 20
Since the proposed approach processes the practical merits that there is no need to force 
the management to give probability distributions, and it can provide reasonable solu-
tions which conserve completely the fuzziness of input information, it can be applied to 
performance evaluations of many real-world cases, such as production/manufacturing 
and service systems. In this section, we investigate an example to illustrate the validity 
of the proposed procedure applied to analyze fuzzy tandem queues with blocking. In the 
solution procedure of this example, several calculations, for example, the inverse func-

Results 
It is easy to find the optimal objective values of Models (15) to (18) by using an integer 
nonlinear programming (INLP) solver. Consequently, the lower bound L( )sL α  occurs 
when  is at its lower bound x (8 )α+  and y is at its upper bound (13 )α− , which 
yields 
L 2 2( ) ( 100 736) /( 16 946)sL α α α α α= + + + + .         (19) 
Conversely, the upper bound U( )sL α  occurs when x  reaches its upper bound (11 )α−  
and y is at its lower bound (10 )α+ ; thus we have 
U 2 2( ) ( 106 1045) /( 22 1003)sL α α α α α= − + − + .         (20) 
Since L( )sL α  and 
U( )sL α  are invertible, the membership function ( )sL zµ   can be de-
rived by taking inverse of (19) and (20) with respective to α , which yields 
 22
1.0419). Moreover, referring to (22), the blocking probability is also fuzzy, it is most 
likely between 9/491 (approximately 0.0183) and 50/491 (approximately 0.1018); and it 
is impossible smaller than 32/473 (approximately 0.0677) and larger than 121/1003 
(approximately 0.1206). The above information that conserves completely the fuzziness 
of input data will be very useful for designing flow-line systems. 
It is noteworthy that the arrival rate and service rate are assumed to be trapezoidal 
fuzzy numbers, but the shapes of the derived membership functions are no longer 
trapezoidal, referring to (21) and (22), which are different from the results of previous 
studies (for example, Jo et al. 1996). This is because that the membership function de-
rived by using the proposed approach is transformed via Equation (6), which is based on 
Zadeh’s extension principle. 
 
Practical Perspective 
Moreover, according to (19) and (20) and applying the Yager’s ranking index method, 
the representative expected number of customers is calculated via (14):

and the recommended blocking probability are approximately 0.1954 which can be cal-
culated in the same manner. 
 
Usefulness for Capacity Planning 
The proposed approach is based on the notion of classical queueing models that often 
are useful in capacity planning for designing production and service systems. Further-
more, the proposed approach can deal with the fuzzy input information. Managers can 
use the above result analysis to decide the most cost-effective capacity, balancing cus-
tomer service and the cost of adding capacity. For example, given the calculated ex-
pected sojourn time at all possibility levels and cost estimates for waiting and idle time,

discussed in this paper, it is clear that other performance measures can be analyzed by 
using the proposed approach. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be also extended 
to evaluate the more complicated performance measures that can only be evaluated by 
using simulation; this case falls into the category of simulation response optimization 
that deserves further investigation.
