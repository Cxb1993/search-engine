晶圓廠的生產排程對於提升晶圓廠的營運
績效而言，是一件非常重要的工作。目前業界大
多同時應用一些基本的排程法則來遂行這項工

不彰。近幾年來，陸續出現了一些新的研究方向，
包括代理人技術、人工智慧、資料探勘與最佳化/
客製化等技術的應用，被認為可以改善晶圓廠生

另一個值得探討的問題。針對這些問題，本計劃
於第一年完成了以下的議題的探討。首先，我們
應用最佳化/客製化的技術，提出 tailored nonlinear
fluctuation smoothing (TNFS) rules 以改善著名的
波動平滑法則(fluctuation smoothing)(FS) rules 的
績效。其次，我們應用人工智慧與資料探勘的技

fuzzy back propagation network (FBPN) approach
來預測一晶圓批的剩餘生產週期時間，以進一步
地提升 TNFS rules 的績效。

1. Abstract
Scheduling in a wafer fabrication factory is a
critical task to the wafer fabrication factory. It is a
common practice for field engineers to select from a
library of empirical or heuristic rules as the
dispatching rules. However, many studies have
shown that applying general scheduling rules to a
wafer fabrication factory does not lead to very good
results. Recently, some studies in this field applied
agent, artificial intelligence (AI), data mining (DM),
or optimization/customization technologies.
Nevertheless, there is still much space for
improvement. Besides, very few published studies
applied several technologies at the same time. In the
first-year project, the following issues have been
investigated. At first, some
optimization/customization technologies were
applied, and then the tailored nonlinear fluctuation
smoothing (TNFS) rules was proposed to improve
the scheduling performance of the well-known
fluctuation smoothing (FS) rules. Subsequently, the
look-ahead self-organization map (SOM) –fuzzy
back propagation network (FBPN) approach was
applied to estimate the remaining cycle time of
every job, so as to further enhance the scheduling
performance of the TNFS rules.

fabrication plant, fluctuation
smoothing, artificial intelligence, data
mining, optimization, customization
4cycle time of a job is considered and therefore needs
to be estimated. The remaining cycle time of a job is
highly stochastic because it is dependent not only on
the factory conditions but also on the progress of the
other jobs. Both scheduling rules have been shown
to be effective in reducing the cycle time average
and the standard deviation. However, the problem is
that the remaining cycle time of a job is difficult to
estimate. Another way of designing a stochastic
scheduling rule is to combine all deterministic
scheduling rules, and every time pick only the most
suitable one. For example, Hsieh et al. (2001) used
five scheduling rules including FSMCT, FSVCT,
largest deviation first (LDF), one step ahead (OSA),
and FIFO jointly. The problem with this approach is
that each time an extensive simulation experiment is
required to estimate the performance of each
candidate in order to determine the most suitable one.
The dynamic bottleneck dispatching (DBD) rule
proposed by Zhang et al. (2007) classifies jobs
before the same machine into some priorities classes,
and applies different combinations of scheduling
rules (including CR, FIFO, SPNB, and SPT) for
scheduling the jobs of different priorities classes.
On the other hand, there are many possible
objectives/criteria in the scheduling of a wafer
fabrication factory, e.g. the average cycle time, cycle
time variation, the maximal tardiness, the number of
tardy jobs, lateness variation, the hit rate, the
average work-in-progress (WIP) level, the average
utilization, and others. Dabbas et al. (2001)
combined multiple criteria into a single one by
forming a linear weighted combination. However,
the weights of these criteria were given without a
systematic procedure. To tackle this problem,
Dabbas et al. (2003) and Pfund et al. (2008) applied
the experimental design methodology as well as the
desirability function approach.
Recently, some studies in this field applied
agent technologies. Yoon and Shen (2008)
constructed a multiple-agent system for scheduling a
wafer fabrication factory in which four types of
agents (scheduling agents, workcell agents, machine
agents, and product agents) were involved. The
optimal scheduling plan was found by the
scheduling agent through enumerating some
possible scenarios. The proposed methodology was
only compared with the two basic scheduling rules
FIFO and EDD. In addition, the common batch
processing of jobs was not considered and therefore
the case might prove to be impractical. Recently
data-mining has been applied as well in scheduling
manufacturing systems. The general data mining
procedure (Han and Kamber, 2001) is illustrated in
Fig. 1.

6applications. However, a wafer fabrication
factory is a highly dynamic environment in
which future conditions might be very different
from those in the past. It is also very difficult
to find out the so-called best practices for such
a highly dynamic and complicated
manufacturing system.
To solve these problems and to further improve
the performance of scheduling jobs in a wafer
fabrication factory, a fuzzy-neural scheduling system
has been constructed in this project. The
fuzzy-neural scheduling system is a modification
from the well-known FS rules by applying data
mining (DM), artificial intelligence (AI), and
customization/optimization techniques (see Fig. 2):
(1) Apply DM and AI techniques to consider the
global conditions better.
(2) Apply DM and customization/optimization
techniques to improve the efficiency and/or
effectiveness of mining the scheduling data.
(3) Apply DM and AI techniques to improve the
responsiveness of the scheduling system to
environmental changes.
(4) Apply AI and customization/optimization
techniques to customize/optimize the
scheduling system.
