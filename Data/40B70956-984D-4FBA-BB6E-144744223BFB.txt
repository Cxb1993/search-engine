Abstract：  
This project explores multimedia 
multicasting for All-IP mobile networks. The 
first part of this project proposes an efficient 
multicast mechanism for the PS-domain 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). Our 
multicast approach is implemented based on 
the Cell Broadcast Service architecture. We 
describe the location tracking procedures of the 
multicast members and the multicast message 
delivery procedure. Also, we develop an 
analytic model to investigate the performance 
of our approach. This study indicates that in 
terms of MMS multicast message delivery cost, 
our approach outperforms the previously 
proposed approaches. 
Furthermore, based on the 3GPP multimedia 
broadcast/multicast service architecture, the 
second part of this project proposes an efficient 
QoS-based multicast approach for UMTS. Our 
approach adopts the existing scalable-coding 
technique to provide multiple levels of service 
quality to diverse mobile devices in the UMTS 
system. An analytic model is developed to 
investigate the performance of our approach. 
The numerical results indicated that in terms of 
transmission costs of core/radio networks, our 
approach outperforms the 3GPP 23.246 
Approach.

二、前言與研究目的 
  
Existing 2G systems support Short Message 
Service (SMS) that allows mobile subscribers 
to send and receive simple text messages (e.g., 
up to 140 bytes in GSM). In the 2.5G systems 
(e.g., General Packet Radio Service or GPRS) 
and the 3G systems (e.g., Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications System or UMTS), 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) [12], [4] 
is introduced to deliver messages of sizes 
 2
for the PS-domain MMS.1 Then we use an 
analytic model to investigate the performance 
of our approach. Note that although the 
mechanisms for providing multimedia 
broadcast and multicast services (MBMS) in 
the UMTS PS domain were proposed in 3GPP 
TS 23.246 [6], the 3GPP TS 23.246 approach 
can not accommodate the standard UMTS 
network nodes as well as the standard UEs. In 
other words, the existing UMTS network nodes 
such as RNCs and GGSNs can not operate in 
the 3GPP TS 23.246 architecture to support 
multimedia multicasting. A more detailed 
comparison between 3GPP TS 23.246 and our 
proposed approach will be presented. 
In the second part of this project, we propose 
an efficient QoS-based multicast approach for 
UMTS based on MBMS architecture. The 
existing point-to-multipoint (i.e., broadcasting 
and multicasting) services for wireline 
networks (e.g., Internet) allow transmission of 
data from a single source entity to multiple 
recipients. With the rapid growth of 
wireless/mobile subscribers, these services are 
expected to be used extensively over 
wireless/mobile networks. Furthermore, as 
multimedia applications (e.g., video streaming) 
are ubiquitous in the Internet world, multimedia 
broadcasting and multicasting is considered one 
of the most important services in 3G and future 
wireless/mobile communication systems.  
3GPP 22.146 [16] has defined MBMS for 
UMTS networks. In 3GPP MBMS, two modes 
of operations are supported. The broadcast 
mode is a unidirectional point-to-multipoint 
transmission of multimedia data from a single 
source entity to all users in a broadcast service 
area. On the other hand, the multicast mode 
only transmits multimedia data to a specific 
group of mobile users (i.e., the multicast 
members). Both the broadcast and multicast 
modes are intended efficiently to use 
radio/network resources, which is achieved by 
the multicast tables of the networks nodes such 
as GGSN, SGSN, and RNC. The multicast 
tables record the distribution of 
                                                 
1Similar mechanism can be used in the CS domain, and the details will 
not be presented here. 
broadcast/multicast users among the service 
areas so that the multimedia data is only 
transmitted to the areas where the 
broadcast/multicast users reside [16, 20].  
Figure 12 shows an example of MBMS 
architecture for UMTS networks [19]. UMTS 
networks consist of both a UTRAN and a core 
network. The functionalities of UMTS nodes 
have been described above, and the details are 
omitted. To support MBMS, a new network 
node, Broadcast and Multicast Service Node 
(BM-SC; see Figure 12(e)), is introduced to 
provide MBMS access control for mobile users. 
BM-SC communicates with MBMS source 
located in the external PDN for receiving 
multimedia data.  
As the number of mobile devices and the 
kinds of mobile applications explosively 
increases, the device types become diverse, and 
mobile networks are prone to be 
“Heterogeneous”. Broadcast/Multicast users 
with different kinds of mobile devices may 
request different quality levels of multimedia 
streams due to (1) users’ preferences, (2) 
service charges, (3) network resources, and (4) 
device capabilities. Thus effectively delivering 
different quality levels of content to a group of 
users who request different QoS streams is 
quite challenging. The second part of this 
project proposes an efficient QoS-based 
multimedia broadcasting/multicasting approach 
to transmit multimedia streams to 
broadcast/multicast users requesting different 
levels of service. 
Our approach adopts the existing 
scalable-coding technique to provide 
multi-layered multimedia transmission for 
UMTS MBMS. Applying the scalable-coding 
technique to wireless transmission is 
intensively studied in the literature. In 
particular, Yang et. al propose a TCP-friendly 
streaming protocol, WMSTFP, which, over 
wireless Internet, reduces packet loss 
improving the system throughput. The issues 
for power consumption and resource allocation 
over wireless channels have also been 
investigated [23, 18, 24]. However, little work 
has been done in multimedia broadcasting/ 
 4
multicast mechanism. A table MCH is 
implemented in the HLR to maintain the 
addresses of the VLRs and the numbers of 
multicast members residing in the VLRs. A 
table MCV is implemented in every VLR to 
store the identities of the LAs and the numbers 
of multicast members in these LAs. In Figure 4, 
there are one multicast member in LA2 and two 
multicast members in LA4. Thus, we have 
MCH[VLR1]=1 
MCH[VLR2]=2 
and 
MCH[VLR3]=0. 
For VLR1, MCV[LA1]= 0 and MCV[LA2]=1. 
For VLR2,  MCV[LA3]=0 and MCV[LA4]=2 
For VLR3, MCV[LA5]=0 and MCV[LA6]=0. 
By using these tables, the locations of the 
multicast members are accurately recorded, and 
the short messages are only delivered to the 
LAs where the multicast members currently 
reside. Details of the location update and 
message delivery procedures can be found in 
[9]. Note that the PS-domain MMS 
multicasting can not be realized by using this 
mechanism because the GSM/UMTS SMS 
architecture is only implemented in the CS 
domain. In the next section, we propose an 
efficient MMS multicast mechanism for the 
UMTS PS domain, which minimizes the 
number of multimedia messages sent to the 
RAs. 
I.2. MMS Multicast Approach IV 
Our multicast mechanism (Approach IV) is 
implemented in the UMTS PS domain, which 
utilizes the existing Cell Broadcast Service 
(CBS) architecture [5]. Figure 5 illustrates an 
example of the CBS architecture, which 
consists of two SGSNs: SGSN1 and SGSN2. 
SGSN1 covers routing areas RA1 and RA2. 
SGSN2 covers routing areas RA3, RA4, RA5 
and RA6. We assume that RNC1 (covering 
RA1 and RA2) connects to SGSN1. Both 
RNC2 (covering RA3 and RA4) and RNC3 
(covering RA5 and RA6) connect to SGSN2. 
The multimedia message is first delivered from 
the message sender to the Cell Broadcast Entity 
(CBE; see (1) in Figure 5). The CBE sends the 
message to the Cell Broadcast Center (CBC; 
see (2) in Figure 5). The CBC determines the 
RAs that should receive the multimedia 
message (see (3) in Figure 5), and forwards the 
message to the corresponding RNCs (see (4) in 
Figure 5). Then the RNCs multicast the 
multimedia message to the multicast members 
(see (5) in Figure 5). In Figure 5, the message 
delivery path for MMS multicast is 
(1)→(2)→(4)→(5). Like Approach III, a 
multicast table MCC is implemented in the 
CBC to maintain the identities of the RAs and 
the numbers of the multicast members in these 
RAs. In Figure 5, there are one multicast 
member in RA2 and two multicast members in 
RA4. Thus, we have 
MCC[RA1]=0,  MCC[RA2]=1, 
MCC[RA3]=0,  MCC[RA4]=2, 
MCC[RA5]=0, 
and 
MCC[RA6]=0         (1) 
In order to accurately record the current 
locations of multicast members, we define a 
new signaling interface between the CBC and 
the SGSN. This interface can be based on the 
Internet protocol or Mobile Application Part 
(MAP) [3]. Table I shows the signaling 
message format in this interface. Six message 
types are defined: Attach Indication/Response, 
Detach Indication/Response and RA Update 
Indication/Response. The Address Field 1 and 
Address Field 2 specify the addresses of the 
MS's current and previous RAs, respectively. In 
the attach, detach and location update 
procedures, the SGSN informs the CBC of the 
multicast member's current location through 
these signaling messages. Detailed message 
flows are described in the following 
subsections. 
A. Location Tracking of the Multicast Members 
We provide a simplified description of the 
UMTS/GPRS attach, detach and location 
update procedures, and show how the multicast 
 6
When an MS moves into a new RA, the RA 
update procedure is performed. Two types of 
movements are defined in 3GPP 23.060 [3]: 
intra-SGSN movement and inter-SGSN 
movement. In inter-SGSN movement, the 
previous and current RAs are connected to 
different SGSNs. We use Figure 5 as an 
example to illustrate the inter-SGSN movement, 
where the multicast member MS1 moves from 
RA2 to RA3. A simplified description of the 
location update procedure is given as follows 
(see Figure 8). 
Step 1) When detecting the RA location 
change, MS1 issues the Routing Area 
Update Request message to SGSN2. 
Step 2) Through the standard UMTS SGSN 
context request procedure, SGSN2 
obtains the MM and PDP contexts of 
MS1 from SGSN1. 
Step 3) SGSN2 sends the Update PDP 
Context Request message to the 
corresponding GGSN. With this 
message, the GGSN PDP context is 
modified to indicate that SGSN1 has 
been replaced by SGSN2. The GGSN 
returns the Update PDP Context 
Response message. 
Step 4) The standard UMTS RA update 
procedure is performed to inform the 
HLR that the SGSN for MS1 has 
been changed. This step is the same 
as Step 3 in Section 3.1.1. 
Step 5) Upon receipt of the location update 
acknowledgment from the HLR, 
SGSN2 sends the previous RA 
identity (RA2) and current RA 
identity (RA3) to the CBC through 
the RA Update Indication message. 
Then MCC[RA2] is decremented by 1 
and MCC[RA3] is incremented by 1. 
The CBC replies the RA Update 
Response message to SGSN2. 
Step 6) Through the Routing Area Update 
Accept and Routing Area Update 
Complete message exchange, SGSN2 
informs MS1 that the location update 
procedure is successfully performed. 
In the above procedure, Steps 1-4 and 6 are 
defined in the standard UMTS specifications 
[3], and Step 5 is executed if the mobile user is 
a multicast member. In Figure 5, before the 
inter-SGSN movement, the content of the 
multicast table MCC is given in Equation (1). 
After the inter-SGSN movement, MCC[RA1], 
MCC[RA4], MCC[RA5] and MCC[RA6] remain 
the same, but MCC[RA2] and MCC[RA3] 
values are updated to be 0 and 1, respectively. 
For intra-SGSN movement, only Steps 1, 5 
and 6 in Figure 8 are executed. In Figure 5, if 
the multicast member MS2 moves from RA4 to 
RA3, the intra-SGSN location update is 
performed. Before the intra-SGSN movement, 
the content of the multicast table MCC is given 
in Equation (1). After the intra-SGSN 
movement, the MCC[RA1], MCC[RA2], 
MCC[RA5] and MCC[RA6] remain the same, 
but the MCC[RA3] and MCC[RA4] values are 
updated to be 1. 
  From the descriptions of the above 
procedures, it is apparent that table MCC 
accurately records the multicast members 
distributed in the RAs of an UMTS network. 
B. Mobile Multicast Message Delivery 
We elaborate on how multimedia messages 
are multicasted in Approach IV by using the 
multicast table MCC. The procedure is 
described in the following steps (see Figure 5). 
Step 1) The multimedia message sender 
issues the message to the CBE. 
Step 2) The CBE forwards the message to the 
CBC. 
Step 3) The CBC searches the multicast table 
MCC to identify the routing areas RAi 
where the multicast members 
currently reside (i.e., MCC[RAi]>0 in 
the CBC). In Figure 5, i = 2 and 4. 
Step 4) The CBC sends the multicast 
message to the destination RNCs (i.e., 
RNC1 and RNC2 in Figure 5) 
through the Write Replace message 
defined in 3GPP 23.041 [5]. 
Step 5) The RNCs deliver the multimedia 
messages to the multicast members in 
the RAs following the standard 
UMTS cell broadcast procedure. 
In the above procedure, it is clear that the 
multimedia messages are only delivered to the 
 8
consumption at both core and radio networks. 
Based on standard the 3GPP MBMS 
architecture [16], we propose more efficient 
multimedia multicasting approach (Approach II) 
to deliver scalable-coded multimedia to 
multicast users requesting specific levels of 
multimedia quality. 
II.2. Our Proposed Approaches (Approaches IIa 
and IIb) 
The goals of our multimedia multicasting 
approach are (1) to have a single multimedia 
stream source (i.e., no duplication at the 
MBMS source), (2) to transmit multimedia 
streams to all members in the multicast group 
with satisfactory quality, and (3) to utilize 
effectively the resources of core and radio 
networks. To achieve these goals, the existing 
scalable-coding technique is adopted to deliver 
multimedia streams. Figure 14 elaborates the 
basic concept for scalable coding. The scalable 
coding technique utilizes a layered coder to 
produce a cumulative set of layers where 
multimedia streams can be combined across 
layers to produce progressive refinement.  
For example, if only the first layer (or base 
layer) is received, the decoder will produce the 
lowest quality version of the signal. If the 
decoder receives two layers, it will combine the 
second layer (or the enhancement layer) 
information with the first layer to produce 
improved quality. Overall, the quality 
progressively improves with the number of 
layers that are received and decoded. With 
scalable coding, the requirement of 
single-source multimedia streams is fulfilled, 
and all multicast users can decode their 
preferred multimedia packets depending on the 
devices’ capabilities.  
However, effectively utilizing the resources 
of core and radio networks to transmit 
scalable-coded multimedia streams is still a 
challenging issue. We develop two 
trans-mission modes for our scalable-coding 
enabled multimedia multicasting: “Packed” 
mode Approach IIA and “Separate” mode 
Approach IIB. In the packed mode (see Figure 
15), all layered multimedia data for one frame 
are packed into a packet at MBMS source. 
Then these packed packets are sequentially 
delivered in one shared tunnel (between GGSN 
and SGSN, and between SGSN and RNC) and 
then in one shared radio channel to all multicast 
users. Each packed packet consists of one 
frame of 4-layered multimedia data,as shown in 
Figure 15, packets are sent from GGSN to the 
SGSNs (i.e., SGSN1 and SGSN2), the RNCs 
(i.e., RNC1, RNC2, RNC3 and RNC4) and 
then the RAs (i.e., RA1, RA2, RA3, RA5 and 
RA6) where the multicast users reside. Upon 
receipt of 4-layered multimedia data, the 
multicast users select certain layers to decode 
based on their preferences. 
For Approach IIA, our QoS-based multimedia 
multicasting can be easily implemented in 
UMTS networks without any modification of 
the existing GGSN, SGSNs and RNCs. Since 
the GGSN, SGSNs and RNCs are not aware of 
scalable coding and can not differentiate the 
layers of multimedia streams, 4-layered 
multimedia streams must be sent to all 
multicast users regardless of the users’ request. 
This may result in extra resource (i.e., link 
bandwidth and channelization code) usage at 
the core and radio networks. Also, this leads to 
increased power consumption caused by mobile 
devices (e.g., the mobile phone in RA2) 
requesting low-quality multimedia streams.  
Therefore “Separate” mode (Approach IIB) is 
developed to improve the transmission 
efficiency of scalable coded multimedia 
streams. Figure 16 shows the scenario of 
“Separate” mode for scalable-coded 
multimedia multicasting. In Approach IIB,each 
layered multimedia datum is encapsulated in 
one GTP packet, and all GTP packets are 
transmitted through a single tunnel. To deliver 
effectively the scalable coded multimedia 
streams, the GGSN, SGSNs and RNCs must be 
modified to become aware of scalable coding. 
Importantly, these network nodes do not have 
to understand how scalable coding works. They 
only need to differentiate the layers of received 
multimedia streams, which can be 
accomplished through the tag of GTP packet 
headers.

Figure 9 plots theπi(j) curves obtained from 
both Equation (2) and the simulation 
experiments where ki =0.5, 5 and 50. The 
simulation model is similar to the one we 
developed in [10], and the details are not 
presented. In the simulation model, we assume 
that Ti has a Gamma distribution with different 
variances , , and . The 
Gamma distribution is selected because it can 
approximate many other distributions as well as 
experimental data [8]. Figure 9 indicates that 
the analytic and simulation results are 
consistent, andπ
2/01.0 iv μ= 2/1 iμ 2/100 iμ
i(j) is not affected by the 
residence time distribution (specifically, the 
variance v of the Gamma distribution).  
The multicast message delivery costs of 
Approaches I-III are measured by the number 
of short messages delivered from the SMS 
GMSC to the MSCs and the number of short 
messages transmitted from the MSCs to the 
LAs. For Approach IV, the cost is measured by 
the number of  messages transmitted from the 
CBC to the LAs. Note that the cost definition 
here is different from that in [9]. In [9], the 
costs of the three approaches for GSM/UMTS 
short message multicasting are measured by the 
number of paging messages sent from MSCs to 
the LAs. On the other hand, the performance 
for the multicasting approaches in this work is 
evaluated based on the number of multicast 
messages delivered from SMS GMSC/CBC 
(via MSCs) to the LAs/RAs. 
Let M1 be the number of MSCs in the UMTS 
system and M2 be the number of LAs covered 
by each MSC (in Figure 4, M1=3 and M2=2).

Let S be the number of multicast members in

number of LAs where the multicast members 
currently reside (it is clear that ), 
and P be the number of MSCs where the 
multicast members currently reside. In Figure 4, 
N=2 and P=2. We first derive the expected 
multicast cost for Approach IV, and then derive 
the costs for Approaches I-III. We assume that 
the delivery cost from the SM-SC to the SMS 
GMSC (in Approaches I-III) and the delivery 
cost from the CBE to the CBC (in Approach IV) 
are the same. This cost will not be considered 
in our analysis.

II. QoS-Based Multimedia Multicasting for 
UMTS Networks 
This subsection presents an analytic model to 
investigate the 3GPP 23.246 Approach I and 
our QoS-based multimedia multicasting 
Approach II including both Mode A and Mode 
B. Without loss of generality, we assume that 
there is one GGSN in the UMTS system. Let 
NS be the number of SGSNs, K be the number 
of RNCs covered by each SGSN, and M be the 
number of Node Bs covered by each RNC. 
Thus the total numbers (NR and NB) of RNCs 
and Node Bs are respectively NSK and NSKM.

For Approach IIA, we have

By using the above equations, the transmission 
costs for Approaches I, IIA and IIB can be

I. A Multicast Mechanism for Mobile 
Multimedia Messaging Service 
Based on the analysis in the previous section, 
we use numerical examples to investigate the 
performance of Approaches I, II, III and IV. The 
performance of the MMS multicast approaches 
consists of three parts: The signaling cost for 
location update, the signaling cost for multicast 
message delivery, and the delivery cost of the 
multicast message. These costs are shown in 
Table II and are analyzed below. ⎡ ⎤ ( )⎣ ⎦ n

the cost of updating the multicast tables can

According to the discussions in the previous

IIICβ  and IVCβ , respectively, where β  is 
the ratio of the multicast message size to the 
signaling message size.

multicast message delivery.

In the remainder of this section, we focus on 
the analysis of the multimedia message delivery 
cost. We consider two classes of LAs. A class 1 
LA has the multicast user traffic ( ) ( ) δμλρ == 111 , 
and a class 2 LA has the user 
traffic ( ) ( ) δμλρ 1222 == . A larger δ  value 
implies that it is more likely to find at least one 
multicast members in a class 1 LA, and to find no 
multicast member in a class 2 LA. Let α  be the 
portion of class 1 LAs. That is, 211 MMN α= , and 
212 )1( MMN α−= . In this study, we consider M1=10 
and M2=10. For other M1 and M2 values, similar 
results are observed and will not be presented 
class 2 LAs where the multicast members 
reside. Table III lists the values for E[P1], 
E[P2], E[Nm1], E[Nm2] and BIII ,θ  for α =0.1, 
and δ =10, 100 and 1000. The table indicates 
that E[P1] and E[Nm1] are not affected by δ  
for 10≥δ . On the other hand, both E[P2] and 
E[Nm2] decrease as δ  increases. The net effect 
is that BIII ,θ  decreases as δ  increases. We 
note that this result is opposite to Fact 4. 
II. QoS-Based Multimedia Multicasting for 
UMTS Networks 
Based on the analytic model in the previous 
section, we use some numerical examples to 
evaluate the performance of the 3GPP 23.246 
Approach I, and QoS-based mul-timedia 
multicasting Approach IIA and Approach IIB. 
Table 4.1 shows the input parameters and their 
values used in our experiments. In our 
experiments, Foreman is used for test sequences, 
and the number of frames (with the size of 
176x144 QCIF) is 400. MPEG-4 FGS and 
MPEG-4 respectively are used for scalable 
coding and non-scalable coding, and Codec 
adopts Microsoft MPEG-4Reference Software 
[22]. Furthermore, uni-truncation (with 
equivalent bit-rate) is used for all enhancement 
layers of I-Frame and P-Frame. Six levels of 
service quality are provided in the experiments. 
For non-scalable coding, the six quality levels are 
defined by 120Kbps, 150Kbps, 180Kbps, 
210Kbps, 240Kbps and 270Kbps bit rates. To 
have similar quality levels (i.e., similar PSNR 
values) for scalable coding, some experiments for 
quality measurement are made. Figure 16 shows 
the experimental results, and the results indicate 
that the bit rate of the based layer (L1) for 
scalable coding is 120Kbps, and the bit rates for 
the accordingly enhancement layers (i.e., L2, L3, 
L4, L5and L6) are 150Kbps, 120Kbps, 105Kbps, 
90Kbps and 75Kbps. 
Based on the bit-rate setting for scalable 
coding derived from Figure 17, Figure 18 
indicates the effect of α (i.e., portion of class 1 
RAs covering diverse mobile devices) on the 
transmission costs CT for Approach I, Approach 
IIA and Approach IIB. In this figure, the CT  value 
for Approach IIA remains the same as α increases 
(i.e., the number of complicated areas increase). 
On the other hand, the increase of α results in the 
increase of CT  for Approach I and Approach IIB. 
Specifically , the increasing rate for Approach I is 
much larger than that for Approach II. 
Furthermore, when α> 46% and α> 32%, 
Approach IIA and Approach IIB have a smaller CT 
than Approach I respectively. From this figure, 
we observe that when all Ras are class 1, 
Approach IIA has the lowest CT . However, when 
α nearly equals 0, the performance of Approach I 
is better than that either Approach IIA or IIB. Also, 
this figure indicates that as t increases from 30ms 
to 90ms, the overhead for Approach IIB decreases 
marginally, and thus CT slightly decreases. 
In order to investigate the effect of the number 
of service quality levels on CT , Figure 19 shows 
CT against α for four service quality levels (i.e., 
L1, L2, L3, L4). Specifically, the bit rates are set 
to 120Kbps, 150Kbps, 180Kbps, 210Kbps for 
non-scalable coding and 120Kbps, 
150Kbps ,120Kbps, 105Kbps for scalable coding. 
In this figure, a similar result with that in Figure 
18 is observed that when α> 66% and α> 50%, 
Approach IIA and Approach IIB have a smaller CT 
than Approach I respectively. However, we 
observe that with the increase of the number of 
service quality levels, the performance of our 
proposed approaches (Approach IIA and IIB) is 
better than that in 3GPP 23.246. 
Figure 20 indicates the percentage of satisfied 
users under limited radio resources. Before 
describing the experimental results for user 
satisfication, the terms for Satis-fied Users and 
Unsatisfied Users are defined as follows. 
Definition 1 (Satisfied Users). The provided 
service quality meets the require-ment of the 
users.  
Definition 2 (Unsatisfied Users). The service 
quality of users is over-provisioned or 
under-provisioned.  
Definition 3 (U1). The number of Satisfied 
users.  
Definition 4 (U0). The number of Unsatisfied 
Users. 
From Figure 4-4, we observe that as radio 
resources increase, the percentage of sat-isfied 
users for Approach I and Approach IIB under 
investigation increases for some specific ranges
