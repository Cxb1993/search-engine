Abstract: 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis is a non-invasive modality widely used for heart 
disease diagnosis. The home care and medication of cardiac crucially rely on long-term 
recording and ambulatory monitoring of ECG signal. To this end, many ECG data 
compression methods have been proposed for the demands of real-time data transmission and 
mass data storage. Recently, the wavelet-based approach has attracted much attention from 
researchers due to simplicity and high compression performance. In this project, a non-linear 
quantization scheme with single control variable is proposed for wavelet-based ECG data 
compression. This scheme provides high and low octave coefficients with small and large 
decimal quantization scales, respectively. This method is based on the association of 
non-recursive 1-D discrete periodized wavelet transform (1-D NRDPWT) and a reversible 
round-off linear transformation (RROLT) theorem. The use of 1-D NRDPWT and RROLT is 
to resist error propagation effect and normalize the significance of octave coefficients, 
respectively. The two error control mechanisms can effectively reduce the searching area of 
quantization scales in an 11-D grid space. By using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the 
experimental results show that this new approach can obtain a superior compression 
performance, particularly in high CR situations.

i.e., , where  and denote the inverse and transpose of A, respectively. This 
property implies that the inverse process can be also performed with non-recursive form. This 
can resist the quantization error propagation in inverse process.

III. THE 1-D RRO-NRDPWT 
RROLT is a reversible transformation theorem [8] able to quantitatively analyze the 
word-length-growth effect and minimizing the register word length of 1-D NRDPWT. For 
convenience, let 「d 」, where 「d 」 denotes the round-off operator that rounds each 
element of d to the nearest integer. From eq. (3), the round-off linear transformation of 1-D 
NRDPWT can be defined as 
=*d
=*d 「 」 and 「 」                              (4) As J =*Js 1−Ad*

where  and QF is a factor used for desired CR selection. For 
convenience, we choose 16 values of QF, i.e.,

compression scheme of SPIHT for the purposes of saving and transmission.

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
For compression performance evaluation, a dataset including the 11 ECG signals 100, 101, 
102, 103, 107, 109, 111, 115, 117, 118, and 119 recoded in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database 
[10], 360 samples/sec and 11 bits resolution, is used as the test signals. Each signal contains 
about 10-min length of sampled data. As suggested in [5], this dataset involves all possible 
variations of ECG signals. The PRD is defined as:

Note that the PRD algorithm acts on a zero-mean signal. Since a baseline of 1024 is added 
for the storage purpose in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, so a level of 1024 is removed

In the experiment, we use the 6-tap Daubechies’ filter for RRO-NRDPWT and a segment 
involves 1024 samples (N=1024). The experimental results are showed in Figs. 2 and 3 that 
illustrate the plots of CR and PRD, respectively. We can found that the CR and PRD are 
controlled by QF parameter and keep the approximately linear relationship for every ECG 
signal. The comparison of the three methods Benzid et al. [3], SPIHT [5], and the proposed is 
shown in Fig. 4. The Fig.4 shows that the proposed method has superior compression than 
SPIHT, particularly in high CR situation. The PRD values of the proposed and SPIHT are 
5.74 and 6.49 at CR=20, respectively. For visual inspection of the compression performance
