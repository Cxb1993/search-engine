nique can only be applied to a closed structure. In order to extend this technique
to unbounded space, special treatments are needed at the boundary of the sim-
ulation domain. Various techniques are available. For instances, absorption
boundary conditions, perfect matched layers and artificial absorbers [6]. We se-
lect artificial absorbers because it is the simplest and easiest to implement. The
idea of artificial absorbers is to place lossy dielectrics at the boundary to absorb
energies, while at same time, let the intrinsic impedance the same as the air
such that reflection is reduced. In doing so, waves hit upon the boundary will
have little reflection and decay in the lossy artificial absorber. The permittivity
and permeability of the absorber (ǫa,µa) interfacing air are calculated by
ǫa = ǫ0(1− j tan δ),
µa = µ0(1 − j tan δ).
Similarly, if the absorber interfaces a substrate with relative dielectric constant
ǫr, then ǫa is calculated as follow
ǫa = ǫ0ǫr(1− j tan δ).
Comparing to the other two techniques, although artificial absorbers are the
least effective, we still choose it because of its simplicity and ease of implemen-
tation in the current established code.
To test the capability of the code in dealing with open structures, extensive
study of the related parameters are performed. A microstrip line is used as
a reference to compute its propagation constant. The result is checked with
experimental formula and convergence.
2.1 Air Microstrip Lines
Similar to the rectangular coaxial lines in last report, the propagation constant
of the first mode of a microstrip line without the substrate is equal to the
intrinsic propagation constant of free space. Therefore, we use an air microstrip
line similar in size as the rectangular coaxial lines in last report to check the
convergence of the simulation. The structure and dimension of the cross section
of the air microstrip line is shown in Fig. 1. In previous year, the propagation
constants of a rectangular coaxial line can be calculated with error smaller
than 0.4% using a sampling scheme of 20 per wavelength longitudinally while
a fixed 10 samples transversely. Applying the same meshing criteria to the
air microstrip line give similar accuracy. In Fig. 2, the sampling rate is 20
per wavelength for both curves except in the transverse direction of the curve
marked “Fixed Transverse” in which about 10 samples are used independent of
the wavelength. As can be seen, the error is reduced significantly from 3% to
0.5% in the frequency range. Note that the curved marked “Uniform” only gives
meaningful results above 4 GHz. This is because the “Uniform” scheme uses
20 per wavelength sampling rate in both longitudinal and transverse directions.
When frequency is lower, the number of samples in the transverse direction is
2
in Fig. 1 and will be used in all subsequent simulations. The curve marked
“Formula” was calculated according to a closed form formula [1]–[5] which was
said to be within 1% error and was used as reference. All errors comparing to
the referenced one are smaller than 0.5%. All data converge to the same value
at Ss = 0.5 with tan δ = 2 and tan δ = 3 most close to the value at Ss = 0.1
while tan δ = 0 converges the most slowly which is expected. Without further
notice, tan δ = 3 will be used as the default.

Fig. 9 investigates the effect of absorber space Sa on the normalized prop-
agation constants. The values of other parameters are the same as in Fig. 8
except tan δ is fixed at 3. As can be seen, increasing Sa from 0.1 to 0.2 gives
little improvement. Without further notice, Sa = 0.1 will be used as the default.

Fig. 10 investigates the effect of top space St ranging from 0.1 to 0.4. Other
parameters are listed in Table 3. As can be seen, for St equal to 0.2, 0.3 and
0.4, the results are almost the same. This means that at St = 0.2 convergence
has already reached.

Table 3: Detailed parameters of the air microstrip line in Fig. 9
To investigate the effect of the top space on the microstrip line without
the absorber, simulations with Ss = 0.5 while St ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 are
performed. As can be seen in Fig. 11, the normalized propagation constant does
not change much as St increases. This is expected since the field concentrates
below the microstrip line therefore changes in the space between the top and
the microstrip line has little effect on the characteristics of the microstrip line.
In a typical microstrip line, the substrate thickness is far less than the wave-
length. This causes difficulty in generating balanced meshes and increase errors.
To lessen this effect, finer meshes are needed in the vertical direction to the sub-
strate. A mechanism is implemented in the code to increase the sampling rate
only in one direction. The final sampling rate in the vertical direction of the sub-
strate is computed as the parameter nz times the global sampling rate. Fig. 12

close form formula [1]–[5]. However, the convergence is much more difficult be-
cause of the thin substrate used in implementing a microstrip line. Testing on
a periodic dielectric-loaded microstrip line failed to meet the simulated results
by double-vector integral-equation method [7]. We suspect that it is because of
convergence issue and is still under investigation.
Our original goal of this two-year project is to applied this new method to
two-dimensional periodic structures like microstrip lines with finite number of
cells. So far, we have only succeeded in one-dimensional periodic waveguides.
The following goals still have not been met:
1. finite one-dimensional periodic waveguides.
2. finite and infinite one-dimensional periodic microstrip lines.
3. finite and infinite two-dimensional periodic structures.
Development of the formulation and codes will be continued.

Eigenvalue Solutions of the Propagation Constants of
Periodically Loaded Waveguides

Introduction
There are two ways for solving one-dimensional periodic structures in frequency
domain. The first is by the method of moments (MoM) and the second the finite
element methods (FEM). In MoM, periodic Green’s functions [1] are required in
the formulation. The resulting MoM matrix is a function of propagation constants.
When the determinant of the Matrix is zero, the correct solutions of the propaga-
tion constants are found. Usually, a root-searching algorithm like binary search or
Newton-Raphson algorithm [3] are used to find the solutions. This process is time
consuming and cumbersome when multiple eigenvalues are needed. The MoM is
also limited to structures in which analytical forms of the Green’s functions exist.
In FEM, a single period of the structure is solved with periodic boundary conditions
[2]. The resulting FEM matrix equation can be cast to a generalized eigenvalue
problem where the eigenvalues are directly related to the propagation constants.
By finding the eigenvalues, the propagation constants are solved. The eigenvalues
can be found by root-searching algorithms as in the MoM or by various matrix
decomposition and transformation techniques [4]. These techniques require large
memory and computation time because the dimension of the FEM matrix is always
quite large. and the sparsity of the FEM matrix is destroyed in the process.
In this paper, a new method of finding the propagation constants of one-dimensional
periodic structures are presented. This technique places perfect electric conductors
(PEC) on the two boundaries of one period of the structure. By formulating the
one-period structure in MoM, a generalized eigenvalue problem is derived. The
dimension of the matrix is the number of the basis functions on one boundary only
and is much smaller then in FEM. This reduces the cost of solving the generalized
eigenvalue problem significantly. The Green’s functions of the one-period structure
needed in the MoM formulation are generated by FEM as in [5]. Therefore, the
geometry and the material inside the structure can be arbitrary.
Theory
Fig. 1 (a) shows the side view of a one-dimensional periodic structure enclosed by
PEC and extended infinitely in z-direction. The cross section and the material
inside can be arbitrary. Open boundaries can be approximated by placing fictitious
absorbers [6] on the PEC without effecting the following formulation. In the figure,
∆z is the length of one period. ~E1 and ~E2 are the electric fields on boundary 1 and
2, respectively. By closing boundary 1 and 2 with PEC, the structure becomes a
closed cavity with equivalent magnetic currents ~M1 and ~M2 on boundary 1 and 2,

The Simulation Result
To verify the formulation and the implementation of the code, the propagation
constant of the TE10 mode of a rectangular waveguide with size 22.86 mm × 10.16
mm is computed and compared to analytical result. The agreement is quite good
as shown in Fig. 3 (a).
To test the program with a periodic structure, the cross-shape strip example in [7]
is simulated. Fig. 2 shows the cross section of the structure. The dimensions are
as follow: a = 22.86 mm, b = 10.16 mm, L = 7 mm, W = 2 mm, ∆z = 4 mm.
Fig. 3 (b) compares the simulation result with those computed in [7] which used a
hybrid MoM-immittance method [8]. The agreement is quite good except at lower
frequencies.
Conclusion
A new technique to compute the propagation constants of one-dimensional peri-
odic structures is presented. This technique combines the flexibity of FEM and
the efficiency of MoM. Simulated result is compared to both analytic solution and
published data. Good agreement is achieved.
