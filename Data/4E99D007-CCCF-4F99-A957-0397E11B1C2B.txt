covalently incorporated various neurotrophic factors 
into gelatin-based nerve conduits. The gelatin-based 
nerve conduits were capable of sustained release of 
neurotrophic factors with substantial bioactivity. 
These gelatin-based materials provided better 
proliferation and differentiation of PC12 cells. 
Animal studies using these neurotrophin-releasing 
conduits for sciatic nerve repair also proved better 
neural regeneration. Nevertheless, the functional 
recovery was not satisfactory when evaluated with 
sciatic funtion index. The causes of limited 
functional recovery remained complexed and 
multifactorial. But, one of the major reasons may be 
attributed to complexed spatio-temporal expression of 
multiple neurotrophic factors relative to nerve 
injury. Therefore, an ideal artificial nerve guidance 
channel should be able to provide sequential release 
of various neurotrophic factors. In this study, we 
applied the ultrasonic-controlled release system to 
the development of remotely-controlled sequential-
release nerve guidance channel. With this research, 
nerve guidance channels with sequential release of 
multiple neurotrophic factors mimicking in vivo nerve 
regeneration were investigated.

There are two major ways to repair peripheral nerve injury: direct 
repair and bridge repair. If nerve stumps were small fragments, the 
neurosurgeons sutured the ends of nerve directly; but at most situation,  the 
impaired sections are large gaps, surgical treatment consisted of suturing 
these two nerve stumps caused suture tension increasely and led to poor 
results[3]. Consequently, autograft to bridge a nerve defect with reduced 
wound tension has been recommended. 
Conventionally, there are three surgeries to repair peripheral 
nerve injury. One is autograft, the other is allograft, and another is 
xenograft. 
When the nerves were cut, the most efficiency and best healing 
methods is autograft. Autograft nerves were derived from patients 
themselves. However, autografts have many shortages, such as the 
limitation of nerve supply, loss of the donor site function, and some 
inevitable problems. Allograft, which is isolated from cadavers, there is 
no limitation of nerve supply, but it accompanies immunoreactions. 
Xenograft nerve which from animals, such as pigs, etc. It’s also 
accompanies immunoreactions. The above mentions do not provide 
good recovery; therefore, researchers have found a new path, combing 
biology and materials devoted in repair peripheral nerve injury. The

surgeries. With respect of collagen, gelatin is derived from physical or 
chemical denaturation of collagen, and it does not have immunoreactions. 
Besides, it also has advantages of much cheaper, easier to obtain in 
concentrate solutions[5], good biocompatibility and flexibility. As a matter 
of fact, gelatin has the same drawback as collagen, that is, it poor 
mechanical strength. So we are trying to use crosslinked agent to upgrade 
the strength. In this study, we choose gelatin as our material and the 
advantages are mentioned as above.

Ultrasound is except for applying in medical imaging, the most 
earliest noticed is that thermal effect of ultrasound.  When given ultrasonic 
stimulation, it increases the temperature of objects and induces tissue or 
cell death, achieving thermal therapy[7]. However, rising of temperature 
adequately can help cell metabolism, cell growth, and cell secretion. Hence, 
some groups were relying this way on ultrasonic for biological effects of 
cells.  
In 2002, Crisci et al. [8]utilized low intensity pulsed ultrasound 
(LIPUS) to investigate rats’ sciatic nerve regeneration. The result shows 
that the sciatic nerve of rat was cut, then, the ultrasound was applied at a 
frequency of 1.5 MHz, and an intensity of 16 mW/cm2, and the apparatus 
generated LIPUS with a pulsed width of 200 microseconds, repetition rate 
of 1kHz, 20 minutes/day, persisting for 20 days, this can be accelerate 
nerve regeneration in the short time.

The objective of this study is to mimic the mechanism of animal 
models after peripheral nerve injury (Fig 3). We hope to fabricate an 
artificial conduit that its surface incorporates two different neurotrophic 
factors (nerve growth factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factors) via 
ultrasonic stimulation, applying to in vitro to simulate peripheral nerve 
recovery after axonotmetic injury.

sensory axons and related to the development of chronic pain and 
inappropriate neuronal reflex[20]. Besides, a lack of effect on motor 
neurons recovery after NGF treatment has been reported[21]. In 
contrary, BDNF has high affinity binds to the TrkB that is expressed in 
motor neurons. The function of BDNF provides motor neuron survival 
and it also promotes the axonal growth both in the motor and sensory 
neurons [22]. NT-3 promotes sensory and motor axon outgrowth [23]. 
NT-4/5 has also been shown to promote the survival of motor neurons 
and sensory neurons. However, these mentioned above have not been 
studied in as much detail as NGF and BDNF. 
The GDNF family consists of four members: GDNF, neurturin 
(NTN), persphin (PSP), and artemin (ART). GDNF facilitates the 
growth of motor neurons in the central nervous system [24] and has 
been correlated with improved peripheral nerve regeneration. NTN, PSP 
and ART were found to have similar survival promoting activities on 
sympathetic neurons in vitro [25]. Even if the members of GDNF family 
exert a variety of functions on neural cells, those who appear to overlap 
the effects of the neurotrophins. The neuropoeitic cytokine family 
generally refers to molecules of the interleukin (IL)-6 family and 
includes IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin-M (OSM), neurotrophin-1/B-cell 
stimulating factor-3, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin 
(CT)-1 and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Besides, a variety of 
neuronal response, which included neuronal survival, differentiation, 
and  neuritis outgrowth have been ascribed to the members of this 
family, these factors also correlated with the elicitation of immune and 
inflammatory responses, regulation of hematopoiesis, and wound 
healing. Hence, in order to avoid these problems, we are not select the 
members of this family to incorporate with nerve guidance tubes in this 
study. On the other hand, many studies evidence that insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) is also play an important role in the regulation of 
neuron growth, development, and myelination. In addition to regulate 
somatic growth and metabolic processes, insulin-like growth factor-1 
(IGF-1) has been found to increase survival of motor neurons and 
sensory neurons as well[26-28]. IGF-1 can act as a treatment of neurons 
results in neurite outgrowth and blocks neuronal apoptosis. In addition, 
via IGF bind protein-5 (IGFBP-5), IGF-1 further promotes axonal 
myelination[29]. Consequently, in this study, NGF and BDNF were 
chosen to incorporate with the biomaterials for the regeneration of the 
peripheral nerve injuries.

Ultrasound was used widely in the past, and its frequency varies 
from tissue to organ. Researchers pointed out that ultrasound energy 
could decay on bio-tissue; there are mainly two ways that ultrasound 
affect bio-tissue:  Thermal effect and Non-thermal effect. Non-thermal 
effects of which are more frequently discussed: cavitation effect and 
acoustic streaming. 
When ultrasound pass through bio-tissue, not all ultrasound could 
penetrate bio-tissue or have been reflected, some may absorbed by 
tissue and energy will generate heat, causing the increase of tissue 
temperature. Hence, whether mediator temperature rising or not is  
depend on the absorption of ultrasound; ultrasound heats tissues with 
higher ultrasound absorption coefficients more than those with low 
absorption coefficients, such as bone. 
Cavitation is the formation of gas bubbles of a flowing liquid in a 
region where the pressure of the liquid falls below its vapor pressure. It 
can be divided into stable or unstable cavitation. When cells contact 
vibrating bubbles or shear pressure wave which produced by breaking 
bubbles, it could destroy bio-tissue and generate the phenomenon of 
lysis which fractures the structure of DNA, thrombolysis or erythrolysis. 
On the other side, acoustic streaming may act to modify the local 
environment of cells, for instance, to change concentration gradients of 
tissues, it also affects diffusion of ions and molecules across a 
membrane, and changes the K+ and Ca++ content of cell[32-34]. 
Sonoporation utilizes the interaction of ultrasound with contrast 
agents to permeate the cell membrane temporarily allowing for the 
uptake of DNA, drugs, and other therapeutic agents from the

PC12 cell line and C6 cell line were both bought from Bioresource 
collection and research center (BCRC), Hsinchu. The strategies of 
culture of these cells are completely different. The followings are PC12 
cells and C6 cells culture method. 
l PC12 cell culture 
PC12 cells were derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma. The 
cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated horse serum (HS), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% 
penicillin-streptomycin, and were incubated in a humid 5% CO2 
incubator at 37oC.Changed the culture medium every 3~4 days. The 
culture dishes were coating with poly-L-lysine to enhance the 
attachment for cells. For the biocompatibility experiments, 50ng/ml 
2.5S NGF was added into the medium without serum.

membranes were then soaked in 0.1% glutaraldehyde for another eight 
hours for further cross-linking. The cross-linked GTG membrane was 
further treated with 0.1 M glycine solution to block non-reacted 
aldehyde groups, and then washed with phosphate buffer solution. The 
composites were used for growth factor grafting later.

3-4.2 Preparation of  PLA microspheres 
The poly (D, L) lactide (PLA) microspheres were prepared by the 
method of double (W/O/W) emulsion. The experiment was divided into 
four parts: first, we added 2g PLA into 18 ml CH2Cl2 solution to 
prepare 10% PLA solution, and stirred at 4 ℃ until PLA are totally 
dissolved. Then, 0.03g Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was dissolved in 
10 ml deionized distilled water. We prepared 0.4% poly vinyl alcohol 
(PVA) and 0.76 ml tweens 85, stirring together until its homogeneous 
mixed. Second, we sucked 1.2ml BSA solution, 1.08ml speen 85, and 6 
ml PLA solution, using ultrasonic homogenizers to go forward to the 1st 
emulsion. Second, we poured 1st emulsion solution into 4 % PVA 
solution to progress 2nd emulsion and stirred for 5 min. Third, in order 
to wash out organic solvent, we put double emulsion solution into 0.4% 
PVA and stirred for 3 hr, then, we used filter paper to leach 
microspheres and washed it by ultrasound until cleansing. Finally, the 
samples were utilized freezing dryer to form PLA powder.

Physical absorption of brain-derived neurotrophic factor into 
PLA microspheres 
In order to absorb brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into 
PLA microspheres, we design multi-porous microspheres to elevate 
absorption capability. We soaked 0.1g PLA microspheres into 
100ng/ml BDNF solution for 24 hours at 4 oC. Then, we use centrifuge 
to delaminate microspheres and BDNF solution, and put 5% gelatin 
solution mixed with 0.3% EDC into microspheres in order to seal the 
porosities. The residue of BDNF solution was preserved in -20oC 
refrigerator until testing enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).

Ø Combine GTG membranes and PLA microspheres 
We allocate 5% gelatin solution, then, adding 0.3% EDC for cross-
linking GTG membranes and PLA microspheres. The materials were 
maintained in low temperature to prevent BDNF releasing or losing activity. 
As the composite was dried, we proceeded to 2nd cross-linking and the 
follow-up steps.

culture dish (35 mm plate) for the culture of PC12 cells and C6 cells. The 
composites were sterilized with 70% alcohol, then, washed with PBS. The 
experiment was divided into four groups (n = 8) and briefly described as 
follows: 
(1) PC12 cells cultured on GEN-PLA composites 
(2) C6 cells cultured on GEN-PLA composites  
(3) PC12 cells cultured on GEN-PLA composites with ultrasonic 
stimulation 
(4) C6 cells cultured on GEN-PLA composites with ultrasonic 
stimulation 
After day 1, 3 and 7, PC12 cells and C6 cells with different conditions 
were investigated quantitatively by WST-1 assay, and LDH leakage 
analysis. 
Cell proliferation WST-1 assay 
WST-1 (4-[3-(4-Iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitro- phenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-
benzene disulfonate) assay was used to detect cell survival and 
proliferation of PC12 cells and C6 cells after ultrasonic treatment. At 
present time point, cells were observed under microscope and then WST-1 
assay was performed. DMEM, containing 100 λ/mL WST-1, was added 
and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 0.5 h. Then, aliquots were 
transferred to the 96 well plates and then read immediately at 450 nm in a 
multi-mode microplate readers (TECAN).

Therasound 3.5 ultrasound apparatus (Rich-Mar Corporation, Inola, 
OK, USA) was used to stimulate C6 cells and PC12 cells; the parameters of 
the apparatus provided by the manufacturer and experimental design are 
listed in Table 3-1. To ensure a more homogeneous distribution of 
ultrasound stimulation, the transducer head: 5 cm2) was placed over a 35-
mm plate, which was filled with a total volume of 8 ml of culture medium. 
Before each treatment, the transducer head was sterilized with 70% alcohol 
and immersed vertically into the culture so that it just touched the surface 
of the medium with an equal distance between the transducer head and the 
bottom of the plate at 10 mm. In the first part of the study, pulsed 
ultrasound stimulation : frequency of 1 MHz, duty cycle 20%, was applied 
on C6 cell and PC12 cell at the intensities of  control, 100, 300 and 500 
mW/cm2, and the stimulation time was 3,5,7 minutes. Meanwhile, 
mitochondrial activity and cell damage were measured using WST-1 assays 
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay after stimulation for 24 hours.

Results and Discussions 
 NGF and BDNF release curve 
Previously, we used different types of ultrasound triggering nerve 
growth factor (NGF) to release, and it detected by ELISA kit. The 
frequency we used was 1 MHz, the intensities of ultrasound were 300 
and 500 mW/cm2, duty cycle is 100%, that is, we used continuous-
wave ultrasound and treatment time is 5 min. These parameters might 
suitable for drug releasing, but it is not favorable for cells. We have 
been utilized these parameters to stimulate cell growth, and these

different cells in GEN-PLA composites, and neurotrphic factors will 
release when we turn on the ultrasound, achieving cell differentiation.

Fig 25: The results of WST-1 assay and LDH assay of ultrasound stimulation for PC 12 
cells. *: p<0.05; **: p<0.005 
We suspected the reason why the value of absorbance of PC12 cells 
was descended after stimulating, and we were eager to know if the 
suspense cells affected the value of absorbance, so we did the experiment 
to figure out whether the cells influence the value or not. Fig 28 is the 
result that the value of absorbance in different densities of cells, and we 
used O.D 690 nm as reference value to observe the O.D. of PC12 cells are 
more significant than C6 cells in high density. But it does effect on the 
value of absorbance.  
	  
Fig 26: The different concentration of cells in O.D 690 nm. 	  
      The following pictures are WST-1 assay and LDH assay results of C6 
cells via ultrasonic stimulation. In the intensity of 0.1W/cm2, no matter 
what the stimulated times are 3, 5, or 7 min, C6 cells have no significant 
difference (P<0.05). Once the stimulation of intensity is getting stronger, 
the cells will be accelerated damage or death, and the absorbance (O.D.) 
are become descend. So we chose 0.1 W/cm2, and the period of stimulated 
time is 3 minutes as ultrasonic parameter.

 Different cross-links reaction to combine PLA microspheres 
and GEN membrane 
 
During this research, we tried to use different percentage to crosslink 
GTG membrane and PLA microspheres. The crosslinks we chose was 1-
ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimmide (EDAC), and we used 5% 
gelatin solution crosslinked with EDAC as the function of the glue to 
connect these two biomaterials. The ratio of EDAC is mentioned as follows:

Because gelatin is easier to hydrolyse, we reviewed a paper which

gelatin films[37]. The result showed carbodiimide is effective as 
glutaraldehyde that it succeeded crosslinking with gelatin. In our study, we 
added neurotrophic factors in our scaffold, and ethanol might be destroyed 
growth factors, therefore, it unsuitable to add ethanol-water mixtures in our 
research.  
I also used the different percentage of EDC to crosslink NGF so that 
I could found the best percentage to crosslink. Here I used 0.3% EDC 
mixed with 0.5% Gelatin as glue to combine GEN membranes and PLA 
microspheres.  We used NGF and BDNF ELISA to realize the release 
curve, and the results as followings:

Fig 34 and Fig 35are cells adhere to GEN-PLA composites. These 
figures revealed that cells are attachment on the surface of the 
microspheres, and it revealed that the material is non-toxic for cells.

在主持人之神經組織工程及臨床醫療的專業與共同主持人的智慧型生醫材料專業結合
後，為組織工程、材料化學與醫用超音波開創了新的研究空間。本研究主題及內容不但符
合國科會生醫學門生醫材料第二規劃子題(Nano-medicine)及未來研究重點第五項(植入
式藥物釋放整合器械)之方向，亦符合國內奈米生醫領域的產學發展策略，也相當符合國
際學術界中生物材料的發展趨勢。針對主持人過去在人造神經導管研究的結果與目前國際
上對於神經再生導管的研究，本研究提供具有仿生系統中多重神經滋養因子釋放的模式，
藉此除了可以突破目前對於周邊神經再生領域研究的限制，更可以由計畫的完成獲得在臨
床周邊神經損傷上新的治療方向。本研究所發展的超音波遙控程序行釋控載體的材料與結
構設計在材料特性的探討上是透過不同官能基設計與改質條件來改變高分子的自組裝結
構，藉以調控超音波敏感性質；另外，本研究透過具有不同超音波敏感的結構來調控基底
材料的解交聯行為，藉此以控制藥物包覆效率與遙控程序性釋放行為，這個過程整合材料
結構-製程-特性之關聯性的探討，對國內外智慧型藥物控制釋放領域也有相當具有學術價
值的貢獻。本研究在生醫材料科學方面使醫學工程研究所之研究生習得下列生醫材料方面
之核心應用技術：(1) 藥物載體之合成製程與結構控制技術；(2) 新型超音波釋控技術的
應用；(3) 生醫材料之生物相容性評估；(4) 具生物活性之生醫材料功能性應用；(5)神
經再生研究之組織工程。本研究計畫透過跨領域的研究計劃之執行，先行建立未來持續合
作的基礎平台，藉由此平台可使醫學工程研究所之研究生從基礎材料合成知識出發，透過
製程條件的設計來改變材料的生醫特性，進而發展具有在臨床醫學應用可能性的學術研
