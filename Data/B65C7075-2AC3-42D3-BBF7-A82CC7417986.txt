Abstract.  
0.95 (Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-0.05 BaTiO3 + 1 wt% Bi2O3 (NBT-BT3) ceramic was used as target to 
deposit the NBT-BT3 thin films. The excess 1wt% Bi2O3 was used to compensate the 
vaporization of Bi2O3 during the depositing processes. The optimal deposition parameters were 
substrate temperature of 500oC, RF power of 100 W, chamber pressure of 10 mTorr, and oxygen 
concentration of 40 %. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA)-treated processes were carried out on 
NBT-BT3 thin films from 600oC to 800oC in ambient or in oxygen atmosphere for 1min. The 
surface morphologies and thicknesses of NBT-BT3 thin films were characterized by field 
emission scanning electron microscopy, and the thickness was about 216 nm. We would show 
that the NBT-BT3 thin films annealed in oxygen atmosphere had the smaller grain size, larger 
capacitance value, smaller leakage current density, larger remanent and saturation polarization, 
and smaller coercive field than the NBT-BT3 thin films annealed in ambient atmosphere did.

Introduction 
Nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (NvFeRAM) was proposed as next 
generation nonvolatile memory due to the advantages of high operation speed, low power 
consumption, large polarization, and lower coercive filed [1]. From the designed structures, 
increasing the electrode area was not suitable method for the miniaturization of integrated circuits 
and continuing decreases in the thicknesses of dielectric thin films increased the leakage current 
density. Thus, selecting the materials with high dielectric constant and low leakage current 
density was the optimal method to fabricate NvFeRAM with high efficiency. Many ferroelectric 
materials, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, SrBi2Ta2O9, SrTiO3, Ba(Zr,Ti)O3, and (Ba,Sr)TiO3, were used as 
gate oxides because they exhibited higher remnant polarization and lower coercive field. 
(Na0.5Bi0.5)TiO3-BaTiO3 (NBT-BT3) ferroelectric ceramics had attracted considerable attention 
because of the excellent electro-optic and ferroelectric properties [2-4]. The favorable properties 
of NBT-BT3 ceramics included a high dielectric constant, a high curie temperature of 320oC, and 
a high polarization charge density. But so far, only few recent researches had developed the 
The cross section of as-deposited NBT-BT3 thin films and surface morphology observations 
of as-deposited NBT-BT3 thin films are shown in Fig. 1. The thicknesses of NBT-BT3 thin films 
are about 216 nm and are almost unchanged after RTA-treatment (not shown here). For the 
as-deposited NBT-BT3 thin films, the morphology reveals a smooth surface and the grain growth 
is not observed. When RTA process is carried out at 600oC, the NBT-BT3 thin films show a 
densified morphology and no pores are observed (not shown here). Annealed at 700oC, the grain 
sizes are in the range of 10 nm ~55 nm and 5 nm ~35 nm with an average grain size of about 31 
nm and 18 nm for in ambient and in oxygen atmosphere. Further increasing the RTA temperature 
to 800oC, the average grain sizes are apparently increased to 73 nm and 36 nm for in ambient and 
in oxygen atmosphere, respectively. Because different morphologies are apparently observed, for 
that the RTA-treated temperatures and atmospheres have large influences on the electrical 
characteristics of NBT-BT3 thin films. 
Figure 2 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-deposited and RTA-treated NBT-BT3 
thin films. The XRD patterns indicate that even using 500oC as the substrate temperature or the 
deposited NBT-BT3 thin films are annealed at 600oC, the NBT-BT3 thin films show an 
amorphous phase. When the RTA-treated temperature is increased to 700oC, the crystallization is 
apparently improved and the (110) peak is observed. The XRD patterns indicate the 
800oC-RTA-treated NBT-BT3 thin films are perovskite phase and some unknown or satellite 
phases are also observed. As the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 2 are compared with the standard 
JCPD card, the crystalline peaks of 800oC-RTA-treated NBT-BT3 thin films are apparently 
shifted to low values. The shifts of crystalline peak are attributed to the vaporization of Bi2O3 
during the RTA-treated processes. The phenomena are explained by that the excess Ti element 
residuals in NBT-BT3 thin films to cause the distortion of lattice constants, such as reported by 
X.X. Wang et al. [12].  
Except the annealing temperatures, the annealing atmospheres also have large influences on 
the characteristics of NBT-BT3 thin films. Smyth et al. reported that oxygen escapes during the 
thermal processes, and oxygen vacancies are subsequently generated according to Oo  Vo++ + 
2e- + 1/2 O2, that Oo, Vo++ , and e- denote the oxygen ions at its normal site, oxygen vacancy, and 
electron, respectively [13]. During the RTA-treated processes the oxygen easily escapes from the 
Bi2O3 to format the Bi atom if we anneal in ambient atmosphere. The melting points of Bi and 
Bi2O3 are 273oC and 825oC. For that the NBT-BT3 thin films have the larger grain sizes because 
the liquid phase sintering effect of melting Bi, as the results in Fig. 1 show. But the Bi will 
vaporize after melting, that will cause the pores and secondary satellite phases to residual in the 
NBT-BT3 thin films and the crystalline structures to be distorted. However, even annealing in 
oxygen atmosphere the vaporization of Bi2O3 is unavoidable. The SEM in Fig. 1 and the X-ray 
patterns in Fig. 2 have proved those results. 
The ferroelectric properties of NBT-BT3 thin films are investigated by the Sawyer-Tower 
circuit using a MFM structure. The Pr, Ps, and Ec values are calculated from the hysteresis loops 
densities reveal the same value, and the leakage current densities slightly increase with the 
increase of electrical field. Annealed at 800oC, the leakage current densities are larger than those 
annealed at lower temperatures and apparently increase with the increase of electrical field. As 
the grain size increases, the grain boundaries decrease after the annealing process and the carriers 
can transport across, Fig. 7 will prove that. These results suggest that high post-treated 
temperatures are not good for the NBT-BT3 thin films. However, annealed at the same 
temperatures NBT-BT3 thin films in oxygen atmosphere show the lower leakage current densities 
than in the ambient atmosphere does. The results are attributed to the less pores (as revealed in 
Fig. 1) and less oxygen vacancy concentrations as the NBT-BT3 thin films are annealed in 
oxygen atmosphere.  
From the lnJ-E1/2 curves of NBT-BT3 thin films shown in Fig. 7, the leakage current density 
is linearly related to the square root of the applied electrical field. The linear variations of leakage 
current densities correspond either to Schottky emission mechanism [14] or to Poole-Frenkel 
emission mechanism [15]. The leakage current densities in the Schottky emission mechanism 
generated by the thermionic effect are caused by the electron transport across the potential energy 
barrier via field-assisted lowering at a metal-insulator interface. The leakage current densities in 
Poole-Frenkel emission mechanism are due to field-enhanced thermal excitation of trapped 
electrons from the insulator into the conduction band. From the fitting experimental results reveal 
in Fig. 7, the as-deposited NBT-BT3 thin films exhibit the Poole-Frenkel emission mechanism 
under the low electrical filed of 75 kV/cm. It means that the carriers are transported through the 
NBT-BT3 thin films by the field-enhanced Poole-Frenkel emission mechanism in the region of 
electrical filed lower than 75V/cm.  
However, the as-deposited NBT-BT3 thin films exhibit the Schottky emission mechanism as 
the electrical filed is larger than 200 kV/cm. Fig. 7 also shows that for the 700oC-RTA-treated 
NBT-BT3 thin films, the lnJ-E1/2 curves are not governed by the Poole-Frenkel emission 
mechanism and the Schottky emission mechanism dominates the lnJ-E1/2 curves. As the different 
leakage current densities in Fig. 7 with the Schottky emission mechanism are compared, the 
as-deposited and 700oC-annealed NBT-BT3 thin films have the same slopes on the lnJ-E1/2 curves. 
These results prove that the leakage current densities of NBT-BT3 thin films are caused by the 
electron transport across the potential energy barrier. The increases of leakage current densities 
with the variations of annealing temperatures and atmospheres are caused by the increase of 
defects after the thermal- treated process on the NBT-BT3 thin films. 
 
Conclusions 
The influences of RTA-treated temperatures and atmospheres on the characteristics of 
NBT-BT3 thin films have been well developed. Annealing at 700oC, the small grain growth is 
apparently observed and the NBT-BT3 thin films shown the densified surface. Annealing at 
800oC, the pores are apparently observed because the vaporization of Bi2O3 (or Bi) and the
