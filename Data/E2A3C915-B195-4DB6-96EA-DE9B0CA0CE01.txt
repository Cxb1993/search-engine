3generally narrow, most of the current researches
of the robot compliant control focus on the
active schemes.
There are two main approaches in the
compliant motion control of robot manipulators:
hybrid control and impedance control. The
former integrates the force and position
information to fit various geometric constrains
in the working space so that the compliant
motion control can be realized. Some
coordinate transformations are utilized to
ensure that in the normal direction of the
constraint surface the force control loop is
active, while in the tangent direction of the
constraint surface the position control loop is
valid (Raibert and Craig 1980). This way the
causality limitation will not be violated.
However, this method requires knowing precise
information of the environment geometric;
otherwise the coordinate transformation can not
be found. It is well-known that the industrial
environment is never precisely understood,
realization of this method is a big challenge.
This is why most of the researches focus on the
second method, the impedance control. Hogan
(1985) proposed to regulate the dynamics
between the robot manipulator and the
environment via some target impedance which
is determined by the designed in terms of
desired mass, damping and stiffness. As long as
the controller of the robot manipulator is able to
give appropriate control activity so that the
robot manipulator dynamics behaves like this
target impedance, the interaction of the robot
and the environment can be achieved. On
advantage of the impedance is that there is no
switching in the transition from the free space
motion to the constrained motion, and hence a
stable transition is easy to obtain. Kazerooni
(1986) proposed to look at the impedance
control problem in the frequency domain.
Anderson and Spong (1988) integrated the
hybrid control and impedance control to
perform compliant motion control. Goldenberg
(1988) used feedback and feedforward
compensation to eliminate uncertainties in the
environment model. Chien and Huang (2004)
proposed to use regressor-free adaptive
controller to deal with both system uncertainties
and environment uncertainties. Huang and
Chien (2010) suggested adaptive impedance
controllers for flexible-joint robot manipulator to
interact with the environment compliantly. They
also presented adaptive controller for
consideration of actuator dynamics so that
high-speed operation in the compliant motion
control can be realized.
Hogan’s impedance controller requires the
knowledge of the interaction force between the
end-effector and the environment. The force
information is usually contaminated with various
measuring noise which can deteriorate the
performance of the control loop or even
destabilize the closed-loop stability. In addition,
the spectrum of the noise might overlap with the
signal band, effective filtering techniques are not
available. This largely limits the application of
the controller in the industrial environment.
In this project, we propose to design an
adaptive controller so that the force information
can be estimated instead of force sensor feedback.
Some experiments show that the design can give
good performance in compliant motion control
with force information.
2. Controller Design
Consider a one degree-of-freedom
mechanical system interacting with the
environment whose equation of motion can be
described with
duKBM    (1)
where M is the mass, B is the damping coefficient
and K is the stiffness. The interaction force d is
assumed to be directly in the same channel of the
control effort u. Suppose we are going to make
the mechanical system behave like the target
impedance
)()()( ddd kbmd    (2)
where m, b and k are known constants and d is
the desired trajectory. If there is no interaction
force, then 0d , and the selection of m, b and k
needs to be proper so that the actual trajectory
will converge to the desired trajectory. On the
other hand, if the system is dissipative, then even
with the presence of the interaction the
mechanical impedance provided by (2) will still
ensure boundedness of the tracking error. Hence,
the transition from the free space tracking to the
contact phase is smooth if (2) is suitably selected.
5approximation error can be neglected.
Therefore, the system dynamics converges to
the target impedance even though we do not
have the information of the contact force or the
system dynamics.
3. Experimental Study
An experimental setup is designed in this
project as shown in Figure 1. On top of the X-Y
table, a Z-axis is installed with a linear motion
mechanism. The Z-axis may move down to
touch the platform so that contact force can be
generated. The X-Y table is used to present
trajectory tracking performance. The system is
operated under the DOS environment whose
sampling period is set to 2ms by using the time
interrupt. The LM1875 is employed to drive the
DC motors. Several HCTL2020 are used to
decode the encoder pulses to feedback the
motion information.
It is required that the Z-axis to travel down
10mm in 16sec and then go back by following
the same trajectory (dotted line in Figure 2).
However, a hard limit is at 8.5mm (horizontal
line in Figure 2) and the Z-axis can not go
beyond so there will be contact force generated.
The actual trajectory of the Z-axis is the solid
line in Figure 2 which gives good tracking
performance in the free space and it keeps
touching at the hard limit when it is not allowed
to go beyond. It is seen that the transition from
the free space motion to the constrained motion
is smooth. The estimated contact force is shown
in Figure 3. The control effort is presented in
Figure 4.
5. Conclusions
This project proposed an adaptive
impedance controller which do not need to
feedback the contact force or acceleration
information and the system is allowed to
contain various uncertainties. The
Lyapunov-like analysis is used to verify system
stability. The experiment results show that the
proposed method is feasible in real-time
implementation.
