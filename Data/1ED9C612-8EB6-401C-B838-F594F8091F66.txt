formaldehyde, formic acid, and methanol
over various semiconductor photocatalysts
such as WO3, TiO2, ZnO, CdS, GaP, and
SiC under photoirradiation of aqueous
suspension. Among these photocatalysts,
wide band gap metal oxides were found to
have greatest utility in heterogeneous
photocatalysis, because of their resistance
to photocorrosion. TiO2 has been widely
used as a photocatalyst for vapor-phase as
well as liquid-phase reactions because of
its exceptional physico-chemical properties
and low cost. However, the photocatalytic
activity of TiO2 is remarkably active only
in UV region, and modifications are
necessary to shift the wavelength to visible
region, so as to efficiently utilize solar
energy. Numerous studies on
photoreduction of carbon dioxide using
transition metal doped modified TiO2 have
been reported. Nguyen and Wu studied
photoreduction of carbon dioxide using
Cu–Fe/TiO2 coated on optical fibers under
UVA and UVC irradiation. Xia et al.
reported the formation of ethanol and
formic acid using multi-walled carbon
nanotube supported TiO2 composite
catalysts for photoreduction of carbon
dioxide. Anpo et al. investigated
photoreduction of carbon dioxide in
solid–gas systems as well as solid–liquid
systems using modified TiO2 supported on
molecular sieves such as Ti-HMS,
Ti-SBA-15, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-oxide/
Y-zeolite, Ti-PS, Ti-MCM-48, etc.
However, in all these studies, most of the
catalysts were active only under UV light
irradiation. The key issue is to find a
photocatalyst that can efficiently absorb
visible light spectrum.
InMO4 (M = Ta, Nb, V) catalysts were
reported for photocatalytic water splitting
reaction under visible light irradiation.
InTaO4, InNbO4, and InVO4 have a band
gap of 2.6, 2.5, and 1.9 eV, respectively,
resulted from their different conduction
band levels. In contrast to TiO2, InMO4
compounds showed absorption in visible
light region. The activities of InMO4
photocatalysts were reported to be
improved under visible light irradiation by
doping with transition metals such as Mn,
Ni, Fe, Co, and Cu, which can induce
bandgap narrowing. In1–xNixTaO4 was
found to be active for direct splitting of
water. Chang et al. reported from density
functional theory that the absorption of
visible light by InTaO4 was mainly due to
gap states induced by oxygen vacancies,
and doping Ni in InTaO4 creates additional
states on top of valence band and gap states
as well.
The photocatalytic activities of InVO4
samples for water splitting under visible
light irradiation were investigated in our
previous studies and NiO was reported to
be a better co-catalyst. NiO loaded on
InTaO4 was found to be active for
photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide
under visible light irradiation. Both InTaO4
and InNbO4 have similar crystal structure,
wolframite-type, and formed by InO6 and
NbO6 (TaO6) octahedron. The difference in
bandgap between InTaO4 and InNbO4 lies
in the difference in their conduction bands,
Ta 5d and Nb 4d, respectively. Zho et al.
have reported a correlation of structural
properties with photocatalytic and
photophysical properties of InNbO4 and
InTaO4. It is important to use catalysts with
low energy band gap, because the lower
the band gap is, the easier the photon gets
excite. InNbO4, having narrow bandgap,
can be a potential photocatalyst for
photoreduction of carbon dioxide. In order
to obtain high photocatalytic activity, it is
needed to load a metal or metal oxide on
the surface of photocatalyst as electron
acceptors. However, InNbO4 has not yet
been studied for photoreduction of carbon
dioxide.
In the present work, the effect of NiO
and Co3O4 co-catalyst on the
photocatalytic properties of InNbO4 has
been explored. Apart from preparation
methods, pretreatment conditions are
expected to influence the surface properties
and photophysical properties of co-catalyst
loaded InNbO4. Hence, the effect of
co-catalyst and pretreatment conditions on
- 4 -
before and after pretreatment of 1.0 wt.%
co-catalyst loaded InNbO4 is noteworthy.
After pretreatment, the yield of methanol
decreased in both the catalysts; however,
higher than InNbO4. But, 0.5 wt.% NiO
loaded InNbO4 showed an enhanced
photocatalytic activity after pretreatment.
In the case of 1.0 wt.%
NiO–InNbO4, the majority of NiO were
loaded as ultra fine particles, which were
not observed by SEM analysis. However,
after pretreatment, there was a formation of
bulky NiO phase on InNbO4 due to
aggregation of NiO particles, which lead to
lower photocatalytic activity. Bulk NiO is a
p-type semiconductor, which induces the
formation of positive holes. On the
contrary, for photoreduction of CO2, hole
scavengers are necessary to facilitate
photoreduction; consequently, bulk NiO
reduced the photocatalytic activity of 1.0
wt.% NiO–InNbO4 catalyst. Hence, it is
necessary to avoid the formation of bulk
NiO.
The characterization results of 0.5
wt.% NiO loaded InNbO4 photocatalysts
showed the presence of ultra fine NiO thin
films formed on metallic nickel particles.
XPS results revealed the dispersion of thin
NiO layer on metallic nickel particles on
the surface of InNbO4. The fine dispersion
of NiO particles on the surface and
interface of InNbO4 plays a major role in
determining its photocatalytic activity. The
metallic nickel acts as a bias for electron
transfer from InNbO4 to NiO layer and the
excited electron can migrate easily to the
surface to facilitate photoreduction of CO2.
In general, hole scavengers are necessary
to enhance photoreduction of CO2;
however, in this case methanol itself acts
as a hole scavenger to improve the yield.
Moreover, the greater mobility of electron
due to core–shell type metallic nickel and
NiO further improves the activity of the
catalyst. The presence of a small amount of
niobium oxide species acts as a promoter.
The existence of Nb2O5, which is an n-type
semiconductor acts as a donor of electrons
and reduces the positive hole concentration,
thereby increasing the yield of methanol.
The reducibility of niobium is enhanced by
the interaction of niobium with elements
such as Ni. Furthermore, it can also
efficiently substitute Ni2+ ions or occupy
the cation vacancies in the NiO lattice and
Tamman temperature of Nb2O5, 893K, is
also a suitable condition of a catalyst to
promote a liquid-phase reaction. The
strong metal–support interactions (SMSI)
between Nb2O5 and Ni metal, and the
strong acidic property of niobic acid also
play an important role. Another striking
feature in the characterization results of 0.5
wt.% NiO–InNbO4 R500-O200 is the
transformation of In2O3 from cubic to
rhombohedral. The key component for the
excellent photocatalytic activity of 0.5
wt.% NiO–InNbO4 R500-O200 can be
attributed to the thin layer of NiO on
metallic nickel particles along with the
presence of small amounts of Nb2O5.
The present work demonstrated the
influence of NiO and Co3O4 co-catalysts
on the photocatalytic activity of InNbO4
for photoreduction of carbon dioxide with
water. All the catalysts were pretreated by
reducing and oxidizing at 500 and 200 °C,
respectively. The as-synthesized and
modified InNbO4 catalysts were highly
active for photoreduction of CO2 under
visible light irradiation. UV-Vis DRS
confirmed their absorbance at longer
wavelengths. The detailed characterization
study revealed that 1.0 wt.% Co3O4 loaded
InNbO4 had fine Co3O4 clusters on the
surface and Co2+ ions in the lattice of NbO6.
After pretreatment, there was a
disappearance of Co2+ and some Co3O4
clusters. The yield of methanol using 1.0
wt.% Co3O4–InNbO4 catalyst decreased
after pretreatment. The photocatalytic
activity of 1.0 wt.% Co3O4–InNbO4 was
found to be lower than 1.0 wt.%
NiO–InNbO4 catalyst, due to the redox
property of cobalt cations.

reaction temperature and slow reaction rate favored the hierarchy structure of the
precursor. The ZnO showed good photocatalytic activity on degradation of methyl orange
under UV light irradiation.
Keywords: semiconductors; zinc oxide, nanostructures; chemical synthesis.
1. Introduction
As a wide band-gap semiconductor with direct band gap of 3.37 eV and large
excitation binding energy of 60 meV, ZnO becomes a promising candidate for functional
materials applied in many fields, including blue/ultraviolet (UV) optoelectronic devices,
transparent conductivity and photocatalyst. Its noncentral symmetry of the crystal
structure provides the peculiar piezoelectric, pyroelectric properties. Many conceptional
nanodevices have been designed based on these characteristics [1-4].
ZnO with nano-size and/or nano-structure shows novel properties. Many ZnO
samples with various nanostructures have been synthesized such as nanoflowers,
nanorings, nanobows, nanosprings, etc. [5-8]. These nanostructure materials are
commonly fabricated using gas solid phase sublimation route under high temperature [7,
8]. These methods sufferer from the high cost, rigorous conditions and could not be
applied for large scale production. Wet-chemical routes are favored to fabricate
nanostructured ZnO due to the relative low cost and simplicity [9-17]. Unfortunately, the
with filter paper. Precipitate with white color was formed gradually. 72 h later, the
precipitate was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water three times and dried
under room temperature in air. The obtained white powder was Zn(OH)2 precursor. The
Zn(OH)2 precursor was put into a crucible and heated in a muffle furnace. The
temperature was increased from room temperature to 150 oC at a ramp of 1 oC·min-1 and
kept at 150 oC for 2 h. It was then cooled naturally. The obtained powder was the
hierarchy structured ZnO.
X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained on a Shimadzu XD-3A diffractometer using
Cu Kradiation (= 0.15406 nm). The X-ray tube was operated under 35 kV, 15 mA,
and the scan speed was 4°·min-1. The morphologies of Zn(OH)2 and ZnO were studied by
scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM 5600LV with EDS analysis) and transmission
electron microscope (TEM, JEM-100CX).
The photocatalytic property of the as-synthesized hierarchy ZnO on methyl orange
(MO) degradation was investigated. The reaction suspension was prepared by adding 10
mg ZnO into 150 mL of methyl orange (MO, 5×10-4 M) solution. The suspension was
irradiated using a high-pressure mercury lamp (125 W, 8 cm away from the surface of the
suspension) under continuous stirring at room temperature. The UV light was surrounded
by a quartz double tube and cooling water was inleted to avoid temperature increasing of
NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH- (2)
Zn2+ + 2OH- → Zn(OH)2 (3)
In the beginning, Zn(NH3)42+ complex ion was very stable due to the relative high
concentration of NH3. As the NH3 would volatile from the solution, the reaction (1)
shifted to the right side and the complex ions were dissociated gradually, and the
concentration of zinc ions increased. The concentration of NH3 decreased due to the
volatilization, this would make the reaction (2) shifted to the left side. The expressions
for equilibrium constants of reactions (1) and (2) are:
])Zn(NH[
]][NH[Zn


K
]NH[
]][OH[NH

K
Since the power of NH3 concentration in the expression of K1 was much higher than that
of K2, so the decrease of NH3 concentration is much sensitive for reaction (1) than for
reaction (2). Consequently, there is only a slight decrease of OH- concentration. Based on
the overall consideration of the ions concentrations in the solution, the value of
[Zn2+][OH-]2 would increase. When this concentration product was greater than the
solubility product of zinc hydroxide under the experimental conditions, the precursor of
Zn(OH)2 was formed.
3.2 Characterization of precursor and the ZnO product
Figure 2B and 2C show the SEM and TEM images of the precursor, respectively.
The precursor was composed of many small sheets with irregular shape. The structure
revealed hierarchy type morphology. The thickness of the sheets could be estimated from
the TEM image. The arrows in Figure 2C indicated the curved sheets whose width was
about 10 nm. It was evident to conclude that the thickness of the sheet was less than 10
nm.
The characterization results of the ZnO powder obtained by thermo-decomposition
of the precursor are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3A shows the XRD patterns of the ZnO
product and the standard. All the diffraction peaks could be indexed to wurtzite ZnO
(JCPDS Card No: 80-0074, a = 0.3253 nm, c = 0.5215 nm), no peaks corresponding to
Zn(OH)2 and other impurities were found, indicating that the precursor was decomposed
to ZnO completely. Figure 3B illustrates the EDS spectrum of ZnO, only Zn, O and Au
elements were observed. The existence of Au was due to the Au sputtering before the
SEM test to increase the conductivity. Figure 3C and 3D show the SEM and TEM images
of the ZnO product. It was observed that the morphology was very similar with that of
the precursor. The hierarchy structure was sustained after the thermo-decomposition
process. The thickness of the sheets shown in TEM micrograph was less than 10 nm,
which was close to that of the precursor.
materials without using surfactants and other additives [19]. As an inorganic compound,
ammonia was characterized by the weak alkaline, buffer actions and the complex abilities.
There was a competition for NH3 and OH- complex with Zn2+ ions. High pH favored the
substitution of NH3 with OH- complex with Zn2+, resulted in the formation of Zn(OH)42-,
which could be decomposed into ZnO nuclei at high temperature as shown by reactions
(4) and (5).
Zn(NH3)42+ + nOH- → [Zn(NH3)4-n(OH)n]2-n+ nNH3 (4)
(n = 1-4, n was close to 4 at high pH)
Zn(OH)42- → ZnO + H2O +2OH- (5)
Because the crystal structure of ZnO was anisotropic and the (0001) plane had high
surface energy, so the ZnO nuclei began to preferential grow up along [0001] direction
[20]. Consequently, the reported ZnO structures fabricated at under high temperature and
high pH were mostly one-dimensional, such as nanorod or assembled structure composed
of nanorods. As for our synthesis process, the possible mechanism is illustrated in Figure
4. The high pH of the solution could guarantee the substitution process of NH3 with OH-
illustrated in reaction (4), but the low temperature retarded the reaction (5). The
dehydrate reaction (6) become prominent [18].
[Zn(OH)n]2-n + [Zn(OH)n]2-n → [Zn2O(OH)2n-2]4-2n (n = 1-4) (6)
concentration of the solution decreased slightly. The results are shown in Figure 5A and B.
The absorbance of the solution at 463 nm (max of MO) was chosen as the measurement
of the MO concentration. The ratio of the absorbance after various reaction times versus
the absorbance in the beginning of the irradiation was corresponding to relative
concentration C/C0. As illustrated in Figure 5B, the ratio for blank test was 0.863 after 80
min. This meant only 13.7 % MO was degraded. The degradation rate increased
apparently when the hierarchy ZnO was used as the photocatalyst. The results are shown
in Figure 5C and D. After 80 min irradiation, the concentration of MO was closed to 0.
