Title：Physics and Device Antimonide-based Quantum Structure and Devices 
Principal Investigator： Chien-Ping Lee 
Sponsor：National Science Council 
Keywords：Antimonide,, “W” quantum wells, mid-infrared, type II quantum dot,  heterostructure FET,  
 
In this project, first, we investigated the mid-infrared light source based on the 
InGaAs/GaAsSb/InAlGaAs/InAlAs type-II “W” quantum wells (QWs) grown on InP substrates by molecular 
beam epitaxy. The photoluminescence (PL) emission wavelength longer than 2.56　μm at room temperature 
(RT) is demonstrated for the first time in this material system. The PL emission peaks of our designed samples 
can cover a wide range from 2 to 2.5　μm at cryogenic temperature. The samples show good optical quality 
that the reduction of integrated PL intensity is only around one order of magnitude from 35K to RT. We found 
that the integrated PL intensity decreased as the emission wavelength increased, which is due to the reduction 
of the electron-hole wavefunction overlap. This is consistent with the calculated result. In the power 
dependent PL measurements, the emission peak of “W” type QWs show blue shifts with the excitation power 
(Pex) but does not follow the Pex1/3 rule as predicted by type-II band bending model. The localized states filling 
effect gives reasonable explanations for the observed phenomena. 
Next, the magneto-optical response of type-II tensily-strained GaAs self-assembled quantum dots in 
GaSb was investigated in magnetic fields up to 14 T. By depositing different GaAs amount, the dot sizes and 
the corresponding emission energies varied. We analyzed the carrier wave function extent of different dots 
using the diamagnetic shift results. It was found that, with the increase of the energy (the reduction of the dot 
size), the diamagnetic coefficient first rises quickly and then saturates at around 21 μeV/T2. Based on a simple 
calculation model, this unusual tendency is attributed to the electrons gradually spilling out of the quantum 
dot to the wetting layer as the dots get smaller. This delocalization effect is enhanced in this material system 
due to the tensile strain relaxation within the dots, which raises the conduction band edge over that in the 
wetting layer.  
Finally, we studied Sb-based heterostructure FETs (HFETs). In this work, we proposed a composite 
channel which consisted of an InAsSb channel and an InAs subchannel to realize high channel mobility and 
high breakdown voltage. In addition, we designed a new buffer layer structure which incorporated AlSb and 
InSb QDs to improve the device buffer leakage problem. We successfully grew samples with electron 
mobility 12000 cm2 /Vs. The devices showed good modulation characteristics and lower buffer leakage 
current (1.5 mA) at pinch-off condition.

temperature. Next, we studied the magneto-optical properties of GaAs QDs in GaSb matrix. Because of the 
type-II band alignment, electrons are localized in GaAs QDs while holes are confined to the GaSb region next 
to GaAs by the Coulomb interaction. As the size of the QDs is changed, an unusual correlation was found 
between the diamagnetic coefficient and the emission energy. We attributed this phenomenon to the weak 
localization of electrons within the small-sized QDs in the tensily-strained system. A theoretical model was 
proposed and the calculated results agree very well with the experimental findings.  
In addition to the above works, we also studied an Sb-based heterostructure FET (HFET) with high 
mobility and high breakdown voltage. In this work, we proposed a composite channel which consisted of an 
InAsSb channel and an InAs subchannel to realize high channel mobility and high breakdown voltage. In 
addition, we designed a new buffer layer structure which incorporated AlSb and InSb QDs to improve the 
device buffer leakage problem. We successfully grew samples with electron mobility 12000 cm2 /Vs. The 
devices showed good modulation characteristics and lower buffer leakage current (1.5 mA) at pinch-off 
condition. 
 
 
2. Research method 
 
2-1 Mid-IR light source 
The structure of a “W” type QW used in this work is composed of symmetric InGaAs/GaAsSb/InGaAs 
layers, which are sandwiched between two InAlAs barrier layers, lattice matched to InP. The barrier layers 
provide a strong quantum confinement to enhance the electron-hole wave function overlap and hence the 
optical matrix element. The band alignment of a represented In0.53Ga0.47As (lattice-matched to 
InP)/GaAs0.4Sb0.6 (~0.7% compressive strain)/ In0.52Al0.48As “W” structure is shown in Fig. 1(a). In order to 
optimize the structure, we first calculated the emission wavelength and the amount of electron-hole 
wavelength overlap by solving the Schodinger equation using the effective mass approximation with the 
parameters taken from the previous articles [21-23]. Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) respectively show the layer 
thickness dependence of the “W” type QWs emission wavelength and the electron-hole wavefunction overlap. 
Basically, wavelength can be tuned in the range from 1.8 to 3　μm via modifying the thickness of InGaAs 
and GaAsSb. However, the wavefunction overlap decreases when the emission wavelength is increased, as 
indicating in Fig. 1(c). This is an intrinsic feature for the “W” type QW. The electron and hole are confined 
separately in different layers, the electron in the two coupled InGaAs layers and the hole in the GaAsSb layer, 
as shown in Fig. 1(a). Since the confinement potentials are large (>0.4eV) for both carriers, the quantization 
energies are decided by their own layer thickness; a thicker InGaAs or GaAsSb layer leads to a smaller 
electron or hole quantization energy and hence a longer emission wavelength. Although the increase of the 
InGaAs or GaAsSb layer thickness extends the emission wavelength, it also makes the electron and hole wave 
functions more concentrated in individual layers, and causes the reduction of electron-hole overlap. Obviously, 
it is a trade-off between the long wavelength emission and the optical matrix element [20]. Although the 
wavelength can be extended with more Sb content in GaAsSb, the raised conduction band edge, however, 
blocks the electron wave function penetration into the GaAsSb layer causing a reduction of the electron-hole 
wave function overlap. So it is still a trade-off situation. Since the optical matrix element is an important 
parameter for optoelectronic devices, structure optimization of the “W” type QWs is very important.

parameters are listed in Table 1, where three series of samples are grouped and labeled as A, B, and C. Groups 
A and B are samples with variable thicknesses of InGaAs and GaAsSb, respectively. Group C contains 
samples with different Sb mole fraction in the GaAsSb layer by adjusting the Sb2/As2 beam equivalent 
pressure (BEP) ratio. The growth temperature is also changed from group A to group C.

the GaSb substrate [25]. As the lattice constant is equal to 6.2Å, the conduction band offset (ΔEc) and valance 
band offset (ΔEv) between InAs and InAsSb are around 0.1 eV and 0.24 eV, respectively. Therefore, by 
inserting a thin layer of InAs layer in the middle of the InAsSb (Sb=0.35) channel, taking advantage of the 
large valance band offset (ΔEv=0.24eV) between InAs and the InAsSb channel, the band gap of the 
InAs/InAsSb composite channel can be effectively enlarged, as shown in Fig.5.

3. Results and discussion 
 
3-1 Mid-IR light sources 
After the samples were grown, the photoluminescence (PL) measurement was carried out using a 488nm Ar+ 
laser as the excitation source and a thermal electric cooled InGaAs(Sb) detector. All the PL spectra were 
calibrated by the response spectrum of a 1000oC black radiation source. The PL spectra measured at 20K are 
presented in Fig 6(a). The peak emission wavelength (λpeak) covers the range from ~2 µm to ~2.5 µm. As 
summarized in Table 1, the λpeak can be extended from 2.05 µm to 2.47 µm by increasing the InGaAs layer 
thickness from 4 nm to 10 nm as shown in group A, and can be extended from 2.17 µm to 2.42 µm with the 
increase of GaAsSb layer thickness from 2 nm to 4 nm (in group B). The sensitivity of λpeak to the 
InGaAs/GaAsSb layer thicknesses agrees well with our calculations. Notice that the full width of half to 
maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectra increases from 13.9meV to 22.7meV when the GaAsSb layer thickness

wavelength as Pex is increased, the energy shift does not obey the Pex1/3 law, especially under low Pex. The 
power dependent spectra of sample A1 and C1 are presented in Fig. 7(a), and the amount of energy shift is 
plotted as a function of the Pex in Fig. 7(b) along with the ideal Pex1/3 curve for comparison (both axes in log 
scale). Since the curves are not linear in this log-log plot, the energy shift vs. Pex does not follow any power 
law. We also notice that sample A1 has a more pronounced energy shift than sample C1. This power 
dependent behavior is not due to the heating effect since the integrated PL intensity is linearly proportional to 
Pex, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7(b). The possible reason for the amount of blue shift to deviate from the 
Pex1/3 law is the state filling effect of the localized states. The localized states are caused by interface 
roughness and alloy composition fluctuation, which are common in the ternary alloy [30,31]. Under low 
excitation powers, the generated carriers occupy the localized states with lower energies. As the amount of 
carriers is increased with increased Pex, higher energy states are occupied and therefore the peak of the emitted 
light shifts to a shorter wavelength. The extended tail in the low energy side of the PL spectra shown in Fig. 
6(a) and Fig. 7(a) is an indication of the radiation from these localized states. We have performed a simulation 
for such effect by assuming a joint density of states associated with the localized states as erfc((<E0>-E)/ΔE), 
where erfc is the complementary error function, <E0> and ΔE refer to the average and the standard deviation 
of the transition energy to take into account of the inhomogeneous broadening effect [32]. ΔE values of 
30meV and 18meV were used in the calculation for samples A1 and C1. When the Fermi level is raised 
because of a higher pumping power, the emission peak blue shifts to a higher energy. The calculated results 
are shown together with the experiment data in Fig. 7(b). Excellent agreement between the calculated and the 
experimental results was achieved. Since sample A1 has a broader PL spectrum, it has a larger ΔE and a more 
pronounced states filling effect. Therefore it has a larger energy shift compared to that of sample C1. In 
general, both the states filling effect and the band bending effect should contribute to the energy shift. The 
reason that states filling effect dominates here is due to the large ΔE and the relative small band bending effect 
in “W” type QWs.

of magnitude reduction in the PL intensity from LT to RT. The reason that the “W” type QWs emission 
intensity can be well sustained to high temperatures is due to the good carrier confinement and a low density 
of nonradiative defects in our samples.

3-2 Magneto-optical properties of type-II GaAs QDs in GaSb matrix 
A. Structural properties 
    The TEM samples were taken from sample A. The cross-sectional and plan-view images are presented in 
Fig. 9(a-b) and 1(c), respectively. The dark areas arising from strain contrast revealed small-sized QDs. From 
the images, the QDs were estimated to have an aspect ratio of 2.5:1 (width of 9 nm and height of 3.6 nm) and 
the areal density of 3x1011 cm-2. The size distribution was shown in the inset of Fig. 9(c). The average base 
width of the dots was 6.7 nm, which is smaller than that of the conventional compressively-strained QDs [33, 
34]. Because of the small dot size, the confined electron states were expected to be close to that of the wetting 
layer (WL).  
 16
The dashed lines (labeled as A2 and C2) show the PL from the samples’ edge, where the growth 
temperature is about 20 °C lower than that of the central area. The QDs formed in the edge are therefore 
expected to be smaller. These emission peaks have the asymmetric shape with a low energy band tail, which 
may be attributed to the QDs with less uniform size distribution due to lower growth temperature. However, 
in the next section, the magneto-PL measurement which probes the in-plane spatial extent of the carrier wave 
function reveals that the origins of these two peaks are from the GaAs WLs. The energy tail has also been 
found in other Sb-contained or N-contained quantum wells (QWs) and WLs [35-39], and is attributed to the 
localized states from alloy composition fluctuation, well thickness irregularity, and other crystal imperfections 
[35].  
 
Fig. 2: PL spectra of the three samples and the GaSb substrate. The solid lines, A1, B1, and C1, are from the 
central area of these samples. The dashed lines, A2 and C2, are from the samples’ edge. 
 
As the excitation power increases, all the emission peaks exhibit energy blue shifts, except that from the 
GaSb substrate. A representative series of power-dependent PL spectra from sample A1 are illustrated in Fig. 
11. The blue shift is in proportional to the 1/3 power of excitation power as seen in the inset, which is a clear 
signature of type-II heterostructure. The spatial separation between electrons and holes in the GaAs/GaSb 
heterostructures leads to the long carrier recombination time and hence the dramatically increased carrier 
density with the excitation power. The accumulated electrons confined inside the QDs or WLs fill the electron 
high energy states and induce a triangular potential well in the GaSb next to GaAs and hence raise the 
energies of holes. These so-called state filling and band bending effects give rise to the energy blue shifts [40, 
41].

the magnetic field for (c) A1 and (d) C1. 
 
We have performed the measurements on various locations of the three samples to study the dependence 
of the diamagnetic coefficient as a function of the emission energy. The result is plotted in Fig. 13. The solid 
symbols represent the emission peaks with symmetric shapes which are assigned as QD optical transitions. On 
the other hand, the open symbols represent the asymmetric emissions with low energy band tails. The 
diamagnetic coefficient first increases quickly with the emission energy for the QD emissions and then 
saturates around 21 μeV/T2 for those asymmetric emissions. This saturated stable diamagnetic coefficient 
indicates that the in-plane spatial extent of the carrier wave function is almost independent of the confinement 
potential. We therefore convincingly attribute those asymmetric emissions as type-II WL emissions. The 
diamagnetic shift of WL in a Faraday configuration depends on the electron-hole separation. For type-I QWs 
with infinite barriers, the electron-hole separation decreases as the well thickness is reduced due to the 
enhancement of their Coulomb interaction [43]. However, the spatially separated electron-hole pair of type-II 
structure causes the lateral separation less sensitive to the well thickness.

light-hole state (solid line) and the heavy-hole state (dashed line) is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 14(a). The 
parameters used in the calculation are taken from Ref. [45]. Due to the small dot size and large conduction 
band offset (480 meV), the electrons are confined inside the dot at a high quantization energy. The effective 
mass is therefore taken as high as 0.08 m0 owing to the conduction band nonparabolicity [46]. The 
diamagnetic response can be further calculated by superimposing a magnetic confining potential to the 
Hamiltonian and then fitted to 2Β=ΔΕ β  to find the electron-contributed diamagnetic coefficient.  
Holes are confined to the Ga(As)Sb region near the QD in this type-II system due to the Coulomb 
attraction to electrons. However, the complicated strain distribution near the QD (with compressive strain in 
the vicinity of the dot and tensile strain elsewhere) is expected to distort the potential profile for holes and mix 
the light hole and heavy hole states. To simplify the calculation, we assume that the hole wave function has 
the same radius as that of the electron wave function, and the hole effective mass is taken to be 0.23 m0, which 
is the average of the heavy hole and light hole effective mass of GaSb. Consequently, the hole-contributed 
diamagnetic coefficient is about 1/3 of the electron-contributed one.  
The calculated transition energy and the corresponding diamagnetic coefficient are plotted in Fig. 14(a) 
against the diameter of the QD. When the diameter of the QD is larger than 11.5 nm, the diamagnetic 
coefficient increases with the QD diameter as expected for regular sized QDs. However, as the QD diameter 
gets smaller than 11.5 nm, the wave function starts to spread into the WL, the transition energy is approaching 
to the WL emission energy, and the corresponding diamagnetic response is significantly enhanced. Since the 
GaAs QDs in GaSb matrix are usually very small and all the dots used in this work are smaller than 11 nm, 
the rising trend of the diamagnetic coefficient is observed as the QDs get smaller. To compare with the 
experimental data, the calculated diamagnetic coefficient is plotted (for the small dots) as a function of the 
transition energy as the red solid lines in Fig. 13 and 14(b). It agrees very well with the experimental data 
until the rising diamagnetic coefficient exceeds that of the WL at 21 μeV/T2, the orange dashed line. In this 
situation, the electron-hole Coulomb interaction starts to play an important role, and this simplified model 
becomes invalid. In Fig. 14(b), by defining the QD and WL region as the inset, we calculate the fraction of the 
electron localized in the QD and plot it as the green line. In the calculation, the electron wave function 
dramatically spreads out of the QD to the WL as the diamagnetic coefficient gets larger than 21 μeV/T2, the 
experimental value of the WL.

grown on it. The active layers begins with 15nm bottom AlSb barrier, followed by the 15nm composite 
channel layers (In0.65As0.35Sb, InAs), 15nm top AlSb barrier with Te as the modulation doping and the 
In0.5Al0.5As cap layer. The sheet resistance of Al0.7Ga0.3Sb buffer measured by the four-point probe was 
around 4300 ohm/ . The surface of the epitaxial structure measured by AFM showed smooth surface 
morphology, with its roughness around 5-7 nm, as shown in Fig. 16. The room-temperature Hall measurement 
showed the channel electron concentration and mobility are 1.18x1012 cm-2 and 10134 cm-2 /Vs, respectively. 
The channel sheet resistance is 521 ohm/ .

The device fabrication begins with Pd/Pt/Au ohmic contact deposition, which was annealed at 300°C for 
30s. Then the isolation mesa was defined by the HF-based wet chemical etch solution. After isolation mesa 
formed, LT-SiN was performed to protect the exposed Al0.7Ga0.3Sb buffer from oxidation. Finally, the Ti/Au 
Schottky gate was deposited by the e-beam evaporation. The device dc characteristics measured by HP4145 
was shown in Fig. 17. The gate length and device width of the device are 2um and 50 um, respectively. The 
device exhibited modulation with Vgs from 0.1V to -0.4V. The maximum drain current is around 110 mA/mm 
at Vgs=0.1V and Vds=0.5V. The device can not be pinched off completely yet and performed leakage current, 
which is around 2.5 mA at Vgs= -0.4V and Vds= 0.5V. The transconductance of the device was ~ 60 mS/mm. 
The Schottky gate I-V was showed in Fig. 18. The forward turn-on voltage was 0.75V and the reverse 
characteristics showed a low leakage current ~250uA at Vgs= -1V and a high reverse breakdown voltage of 
above 1V.

4. Conclusion 
In this project, first, we have studied the InGaAs/GaAsSb/InAlGaAs/InAlAs “W” type QWs grown on 
InP substrates. The emission wavelength covers the range from ~2 to ~2.5 µm at low temperature. The 
trade-off between long wavelength emission and high optical matrix element predicted by the simulation has 
been confirmed by the results of PL spectra. The type-II band alignment in the “W” structure has been 
characterized by the power dependent PL measurements. The peak position shifts to shorter wavelength as Pex 
increases. It was found the amount of energy shifts does not follow the Pex1/3 law as most type II structures. 
The localized states filling effect due do the surface roughness and alloy fluctuation is proposed to explain the 
observed phenomenon. The calculated results agree well with the experiment results. The temperature 
dependent PL spectra show the well sustained emission at RT, and the emission wavelength of the “W” type 
QWs can be extended to over 2.56 µm. According to our experiments and simulation results, it is very 
promising to develop the Mid-IR lasers on InP substrates employing the “W” structure of 
InGaAs/GaAsSb/InGaAs QWs. 
Next, type-II tensily-strained GaAs QDs in GaSb with mid-IR emission up to 2.2 μm were studied by 
magneto-PL for the first time. By comparing several samples with different GaAs deposition amount, the 
diamagnetic coefficient was found to rise quickly from 7.6 μeV/T2 to a saturated value of around 21 μeV/T2 
with the emission energy. This unusual behavior is due to the spreading of the electron wave function from the 
QD to the WL as the dots get smaller. A theoretical calculation of the diamagnetic shift in this type-II QD 
system considering the strain effect is performed and the results agree with the experimental finding. 
Finally, we successfully grew samples with electron mobility ~12000 cm-2 /Vs for the application of 
Sb-based high speed electronic device. The sheet resistance of buffer layer was further improved from 4300 
ohm to 25000 ohm by using a two-layer QD buffer structure. The corresponding device performance showed 
good modulation characteristics and lower buffer leakage current (1.5 mA) at pinch-off condition. The 
Schottky gate also performed good forward turn-on and reverse low leakage current characteristics. We will 
continue to improve device isolation to realize a Sb-based HFET with complete pinch-off, high mobility and 
high breakdown voltage.
