Abstract 
This project proposes a method of secret im-
age sharing by applying the Modulus Function. 
Initially, cover images are partitioned into 
four-pixel blocks. The sum value of bits that are 
not used to embed secret data is calculated for 
each four-pixel block. The range of all possible 
sum values is segmented to some sections in 
advance, and each section has its own represen-
tation value. Once the calculated sum value falls 
into a certain section, the representation value of 
this section is used to produce shadow data. 
Following this, the produced shadow data is 
embedded into a four-pixel block by using the 
Modulus Function. In the recovery phase, both 
the representation value and the shadow data are 
required. However, it is quit possible that the 
representation value has been changed owing to 
the modification of the sum value when embed-
ding by using the Modulus Function. In this case, 
the pixels are modified to draw their sum value 
back to the original section. According to the 
experimental results, stego-images produced by 
the proposed method have better image quality 
than those produced by related works.

計畫緣由及目的 
To maintain secrecy and security of digital 
data traveling over the internet, data is encrypted 
by using one or more of several data encryption 
methods. Commonly, secret data is encrypted to 
ciphertext with a secret key and only the legal 
user, with the secret key, can decrypt the cipher-
text back to the secret data. After that, digital 
signature schemes and digital multi-signature 
schemes [10] become popular research areas. 
The legal user signs a document with his/her 
private key (secret key) and the signed data can 
be authenticated by using the legal user’s public 
key. It goes without saying that the secret key 
must be protected from illegal users. However, it 
is very likely that a careless person may lose 
his/her secret key. In order to solve this problem, 
a method is proposed to accomplish 
safe-keeping and distribution in the crypto-
graphic system. This method partitions the secret 
key into shadows, which are distributed to legal 
users. This way, the 
 only one person. 
In 1979, Shamir [5] proposed a (t, n) thresh-
 
 
However, there is a problem when the Modulus 
Function is involved. The process of the 
Modulus Function has the possibility of modi-
fying the unused bits of the cover pixels. Note 
that the shadow data are derived from those un-
used bits of the cover pixels. If they are modi-
fied, the secret image can not be recovered. In 
order to solve this problem, the sum value of the 
unused bits is calculated first. The range of all 
possible sum values is segmented to some sec-
tions in advance, and each section has its own 
representation value. When a sum value falls in 
a certain section, the representation value of this 
section is involved to produce shadow data. This 
way, the Modulus Function can be used to em-
bed shadow data to cover images freely. How-
ever, there is still a chance that the sum value 
will fall into other sections. In this case, the un-
used bits in the four-pixel block are modified to

going further, some notations related to 
four-pixel blocks should be illustrated. First of 
all, I(i) represents the i-th cover image among all 
n cover images. Each cover image is partitioned 
into four-pixel non-overlapping blocks. The no-

block in the i-th cover image. Each four-pixel

The binary representation of the shadow data 
is (s1, s2, ..., s8 ). Chang et al.’s method embeds 
the shadow data into two bits of each pixel in a 
four-pixel block. After embedding the shadow 
data to the cover images, the stego-images  
be obtained. The symbol Î(i) is used to denote the 
i-th stego-image. Similarly, the symbol )( )(ˆ

represents the j-th four-pixel block in the i-th

needed to embed as authentication data. Chang 
et al’s method reserved four bits to keep the au-
thentication data. The reserved bit positions are 
located at A1, A2, A3, and A4 as shown in Fig 1. 
To produce four authentication bits, Chang et al. 
first set the bits used to embed four authentica-
tion bits as 0; those modified four pixels are then 
used to produce a large number by using the 
Chinese Remainder Theorem. Next, the XOR

文獻探討 
In this section, two related methods are in-
troduced. The first subsection illustrates how to 
use Chang et al.’s method to share a secret im-
age. The second subsection demonstrates the 
image hid
Function. 
 Chang et al.’s Image Sharing Method 
The purpose of image sharing is to share a 
secret image to n cover images to form n 
stego-images. Any t of n stego-images can re-
construct the secret image. No information con-
cerning the secret image is revealed through 
stego-images if the number of cooperating 
stego-images is less than t. To achieve this goal, 
Chang et al.’s method first partitions each cover 
image into four-pixel blocks, and the secret im-
age is also divided into blocks with t pixels in 
each block. Each secret block is assigned se-
quentially to one four-pixel block. This way, the 
i-th block of each cover image is related to the 
i-th secret block, and each secret block can be 
shared with its related cover blocks as follows. 
First of all, the (t-1)-degree polynomial function 
should be generated. Chang et al. generated their 
e four authentication bits A1, A2, A3 and A4. 
The relationship between these notations is 
shown in Fig. 1. 
In the recovery phase, the first step extracts 
the shadow data and the five most-significant 
bits from each four-pixel block. By referring to 
two kinds of data extracted from the cover im-
 
Lin’s method modifies the grayscale pixel y to ŷ 
such that ŷ mod 2k = s. Moreover, the modified 
pixel ŷ should be the closest value to the original 
pixel y among all possible values. In Fig. 3(a), 
there are two pixel values whose three 
least-significant bits are equal to secret data 
 4
(000)2. They are (128)10 and (120)10. However, 
(128)10 is closest to (127)10. Therefore, by using 
the Modulus Function, the final result is (128) .  10

3. 研究方法 
In this section, the Modulus Function is involved 
to reduce the degradation of the cover images. Before 
going further, let us describe the key features and 
important advantages compared with other methods. 
Although there are many methods proposed to do 
secret image sharing, these methods embedded the 
data by using the LSB replacement method. For ex-
ample, Yang et al.’s method [12] and Chang et al.’s 
method [3] used different methods to produce sharing 
data and authentication data. But, both methods em-
bedded those data by using the LSB replacement 
method. If the secret image sharing methods embed 
their data by using the LSB replacement method, it 
can be guaranteed that applying the proposed method 
on them can further reduce the degradation. This is 
the important advantages of the proposed method. 
The original way of producing authentication data in
Yang et al.’s and Chang et al.’s methods can be re-
tained. For this reason, there is no description about 
producing authentication data in the following para-
graphs.  
However, the Modulus Function can not be ap-
plied to secret image sharing directly. The reason is 
that the Modulus Function may modify the unused 
bits which are used to be an input of Formula (1). In 
the example in Fig. 2, the value of the first pixel is 
(132)10 and its binary representation is (10000100)2. 
The five most-significant bits of the first pixel is 
(16)10. We assume that the 3-bit data is (000)2. By 
applying the Modulus Function, the final result is 
(136)10 and its binary representation is (10001000) . 
The 
2
five most-significant bits of the first pixel have 
been changed to (17)10. It goes without saying that 
the secret pixels can not be recovered through the 
modified pixel.  
This paper attempts to eliminate the influence of 
the above problem. The proposed method partitions 
the bits in a pixel into two parts. One part represents 
the bits used to embed data while the other part is the 
remaining bits. The second part is named as Unused 
Bits, as shown in Fig. 4. The part, Unused Bits, is not 
used for embedding purposes. There is an important 
point that should be described in this stage. The 
maximum absolute difference value of Unused Bits 
between the original pixel and the embedded pixel is 
1. Referring to the example in Fig. 3(a), the original 
pixel value is (127)10 and its binary representations is 
(01111111)2. The Unused Bits of this pixel is 
(01111)2. After embedding (000)2 by applying the 
Modulus Function, the embedded pixel becomes 
(128)10 d its binary representations is (10000 an 000)2. 
The Unused Bits of the embedded pixel is (10000)2. 
The differe w 2 and (01111)2 is 1.

12k . If the value of k is set 
as 3, then the distance value is in the range from -3 to 
4. If the value of Unused Bits is modified more than 
two, the modification quantity of a pixel should be 
larger than 8. However, this is impossible, because 
once the modification quantity of a pixel is larger 
than 8, Formula (3) will modify it to the range from 
-3 to 4. Therefore, we can be sure that distance value 
of Unused Bits between the original pixel and the 
embedded pixel may be 1, 0 or -1. This concept 
drives us to sum up al

secret image was Plane shown in Fig. 7 (d) with size 
of 128  128 pixels. Three cover images with size of 
256  256 pixels were shown in Fig. 7 (a), Fig. 7 (b) 
and Fig. 7 (c). They were Lena, Pepper and Barb.

Three different cover images were used to per-
form secret image sharing. In other words, the secret 
image was shared between three cover images, and 
with any two of three stego-images t
could be recovered. The way to estimate the quality 
of 
he secret image 
stego-images was the peak signal to noise ratio 
(PSNR), calculated from the following formula:

The symbols α(I, J) and β(I, J) represent the pixel 
values at the position (I, J) in the stego-image and the 
original image, respectively. The symbols w and h 
represent the pixel numbers for the width and the 
height of the image, respectively. 
In the first experiment, different lengths of the 
authentication bits are embedded into stego-images. 
Because the bit lengths are different, the numbers of 
LSB bits reserved for embedding are different, which 
influences the Formula (5) and Formula (8). To ad-
just Formula (5) and Formula (8), the bit number that 
each pixel needs to right shift is related to the total bit 
number of embedded data. For example, if the num-
ber of authentication bits is 1, that means one bit of 
the first pixel in the four-pixel block should be re-
served for embedding the authentication bit. Except 
for the authentication bit, two bits are still needed to 
embed the shadow data. Therefore, the first pixel 
must be right shifted three bits while the other pixels 
are right shifted two bits, as shown in Fig .8. Follow-
ing from the above example, the first pixel needs to 
be right shifted three bits when calculating the value 
of Formula (8). That is, the value of k in the first 
pixel in Formula (8) should be three, and in the other 
pixels should be two. The remaining procedures are 
the same as described in Section 3. 
Fig. 8. An example with one authentication bit 
The PSNR values of the stego-images in the pro-
posed method are shown in Table 1. It is no surprise 
that PSNR values relate to the number of authentica-
tion bits. Another point is that the image qualities of 
Lena, Pepper and Barb are degraded gradually. Note 
that input values of the (t-1)-degree polynomial func-
tion at the same position of different cover images 
can not be the same. When dealing with the first 
cover image, the condition need not be considered. 
However, when the second cover image is processed, 
the input value of Formula (5) can not be same as the 
value at the same position of the first cover image. If 
this happens, the pixels of the four-pixel block in the 
second image should be modified. It goes without 
saying that the third image has more chances of being 
es 
of Lena, Pepper and Barb are degraded gradually. 
Alth e third image is most, the 
image quality is still acceptable.

Yang et al.’s method only embedded one authentica-
tion bit in each four-pixel block while Chang et al.’s 
method embedded four authentication bits in each 
four-pixel block. Therefore, the proposed method is 
adjusted to embed one authentication bit and four 
authentication bits, respectively. The PSNR values of 
the stego-images using different methods are shown
