如何量測及控制薄厚膜材料之性質，對於開發光電、半導體及微機電元件系統，以及其相關製
程是非常重要的。雖然一般塊材的性質或行為大都可以經由一些標準材料手冊查詢而得，然而薄厚
膜材料就不見得那樣方便。一般而言，薄厚膜材料性質除了與製程條件不同而有所不同外，與溫度
的改變也有密切的關係，更何況許多材料會在不同溫度狀況下使用，溫度對這些材料的影響如何，
是必須有所了解的。此外，無論何種薄膜製造技術，例如：化學氣相沉積、物理氣相沉積、高溫爐
管或電鍍，都顯示其潛在的非均勻性，導致整片基板的薄膜厚度、殘留應力及材料性質分佈有所差
異。薄厚膜材料除了重視電的性質外，熱與力方面的材料性質則是攸關製程成敗或元件系統特性的
關鍵要素，尤其是應用在微結構的製作上。雖然已有許多用來量測塊材材料性質的儀器設備及方
法，但這些卻不見得適用於薄厚膜材料的量測，即使目前使用在薄厚膜材料的儀器，所用的方法也
不見得簡易方便，試片的準備也大費周章，而且大部分需使用到昂貴的儀器及特殊之週邊輔助治
具。雖然對於如何量測薄厚膜材料性質的研究及文獻記載有相當多，然而由文獻中發現，若要對一
種材料同時進行其數種性質量測及行為觀察分析，這樣的測試方法及儀器卻十分稀少。因此，本計
畫擬將開發一套嶄新且又便宜、操作簡易的量測模組，此模組結合一般光學顯微鏡、加熱器、試片
治具、微測試結構、電源供應器及影像分析系統(含 CCD 及影像處理軟體)，即可進行薄厚膜材料
之殘留應力、熱膨脹係數、楊氏係數及熱傳導係數的即時量測，並且也可用來進行薄厚膜材料在熱
處理(退火)過程中殘留應力的變化分析。同一薄厚膜材料的不同性質可藉由相同的測試結構獨立量
測而得。藉由解析模式和有限元素模式的推導，以及數據擷取和分析之程式的撰寫，便可建立快速
求得薄厚膜性質的實驗及分析程序。本計劃量測模組所使用之儀器設備在一般實驗室均可方便取
得。測試結構乃利用簡單的面型加工犧牲層法製作，可同時與元件成形在同一基板上，監測薄厚膜
材料之性質，而且僅佔基板空間上非常小的區域。本研究主要是構思出整個量測模組之架構及操作
方式，針對加熱器及試片治具進行設計、分析與製作，完成整個量測模組的組合安裝，之後設計及
製作測試結構，並進而進行薄厚膜材料性質之實驗量測。

The sufficient well control and determination of material properties of films is vital for the design and 
fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), integrated circuit (IC) and photoelectric devices. 
Commonly, the material properties of films are process-dependent and size-dependent. Meanwhile, they 
may also be strongly dependent on the temperature change. The microstructures of the resulting films 
from any of deposition techniques, such as CVD, PVD, furnaces, electroplating, can exhibit 
non-uniformities that result in variations of thickness, residual stress, and material property across the 
substrate. Although there are well-documented material data of thin films in IC, these are mostly 
emphasized on electrical properties. Instead of electrical properties, thermo-mechanical properties of 
films in which the mechanical behavior of the structures in MEMS made from these films are of central 
interest, and they have drastic effects on the behaviors of IC and MEMS devices. Unfortunately, the 
database for such properties has not been fully established. Even though there are well-documented 
properties of bulk materials, they may not be directly applicable to thin films. Generally, the conventional

前言 
Applications of in situ hot-stage microscopy, related to material properties, are very important for 
MEMS and IC films development. In this project, a measurement module is developed for the most 
comprehensive option for films characterization, specifically designed to give full control of 
environmental conditions while performing optical microscopy. Users have the ability to perform 
electrical and mechanical testing as a function of environmental parameters, such as temperature and 
varying gases or vacuum conditions. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the measurement module 
that is constructed specifically for determining thermo-mechanical properties of film materials. After 
constructing the hot stage it can be placed directly into a commercial optical microscope stage. The 
temperature of the specimen will be held constant within around + 0.1 °C in temperature range (room 
temperature to +1000°C). A specific protective gas supply and vacuum box can be optionally used to 
obtain measurement in varying gases or vacuum conditions. The measuring images in the microscope can 
be described with the CCD and image capture software. The measurement module allows unique ability 
to perform in-plane measurements presents multiple options for analysis including: real-time 
measurement, real-time analysis and average displacement over the entire area or defined areas of study.

z The commercial hot stage and the sample holder 
The hot stage is modified from the commercial product TS1500 (high temperature heating system 
made from Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd) to be suited to the study of this project. The heating 
system consists of a hot stage (Fig. 2), a temperature controller (Fig. 3), a cooling unit (Fig. 4), and a 
vacuum and purge system (optional). The hot stage can fit onto the mechanical stage of the microscope 
in the manner as a slide, as shown in Fig. 5. The hot stage can therefore be moved relative to the optics 
by the normal mechanical stage controls. The mall size, ease of assembly, and simplicity of operation 
makes it suitable for implementation in any laboratory for research or teaching purposes. The sample is 
placed inside into the 2.5mm deep ceramic heating chamber so that the sample is heated from

(2) Design and Fabrication of the test structures  
z Configuration of the Test Structures 
Figure 1 displays the schematic diagram of the test structures, which can be applied to determine the 
residual strain(RS), linear thermal expansion coefficient(LTEC), Young’s modulus(YM) and thermal 
conductivity coefficient(TCC). The test structures comprise of a pair of basic structures (herein, defined 
as stain gauges) and cantilever beams. The basic structures are made of the measured film, and the 
cantilever beams are made of the calibration film. The basic structure is similar to the author’s previous 
works as shown in Fig. 2 [1, 2]. The detailed performance of the basic structure can be found in both

elongation (or contraction) difference of the two beams of strain gauge. By integrating equations (2), (3), 
(4), and (5), four simultaneous equations are derived. 
             e1 = a1⋅P + b1⋅F + c1⋅M + d1⋅Fc                      (6) 
              0 = a2⋅P + b2⋅F + c2⋅M + d2⋅Fc               (7) 
              0 = a3⋅P + b3⋅F + c3⋅M + d3⋅Fc               (8) 
           δd = a4⋅P + b4⋅F + c4⋅M + d4⋅Fc              (9) 
where a1 ∼ a4, b1 ∼ b4, c1 ∼ c4, and d1 ∼ d4 have been listed in Table 1.  Therefore, by solving these 
four equations, the values of axial force P, transverse force F, bending moment M, and the reaction force 
-Fc can be found as follows.

The vertical bars mean determinant. The conversion factor γ is related to geometrical parameters of the 
structure, including L1, L2, w, and S only. 
Furthermore, with the mechanical analytical model of the basic structure (Fig. 3(a)) for determining 
RS and LTEC, the residual strain (ε) can be expressed as a function of δ by [1] 
ε = γ ⋅ δ                                  (13) 
, and the residual stress (σ) can be obtained as 
σ = E ⋅ε= E ⋅ γ ⋅ δ                (14) 
Similarly, the TEC (α) can be calculated by [2] 
α = δ / (γ⋅ ∆Tf)                                (15) 
∆Tf = T2 – T1, T2 and T1 are two elevated temperatures. Symbol δ depicts the displacement at the tip end 
of the basic structure due to residual strain or thermal expansion. 
In order to determine TCC, we need to apply current through the beams of the basic test structure, as 
shown in Fig. 4, thereby a temperature rise throughout the test structure causes the deflection of the 
beams due to the difference of elongation of the two cantilever beams. So, a displacement is generated at 
a free end of the tip beam.  
 10
the displacements and the stress levels of the characterization structure has been analyzed by Pan and Hsu 
[1]. Therefore, prior to, during and after each cycle of heat treatment, the stress levels in the structure can 
be determined as function of temperature and time. Because in this method the characterization structure 
is free from the substrate, the stress-level of the structure during heat treatment is comprised of only 
thermal stress (expansion or contraction) and intrinsic stress (transformation stress, recrystallization stress, 
or 
def
ect 
stre
ss, 
etc.) 
of 
the 
thin film, excluding stresses coming from the intersection between substrate and thin film, e. g. thermal 
stress due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients. 
In this study, heat treatment processes are carried out in a high temperature hot stage in air ambient or 
with protective gas purge. The heat treatment cycles are conducted by ramping to the peak temperature at 
20℃/sec. The peak temperatures are varied from 550℃ to 1100℃. Holding time range from 1 min. to 
about1 hr. During heat treatment, the difference between the two test beams with respect to elongation or 
contraction causes the deflection of the basic structure (Fig. 2). Consequently, a magnified displacement 
is generated at the tip beam. The elongation or contraction may be resulted from the changes in such 
factors as thermal effect, phrase transformation, stress relieving or metallurgical microstructure. Since the 
displacement of the tip beam is sufficiently large, direct observations under a microscope with the 
specimen placed in a heating stage can be used to collect reasonably accurate data.

(3) Set-up of the Measurement Module 
The experimental apparatus utilized in this work are inexpensive and readily available in a laboratory. 
They include a hot stage and a conventional optical microscope plus a CCD and an image processing 
software (the Matrox Inspector version 3.1 package). Through the CCD with an image analysis system, a 
direct measurement of the lateral displacements of test structures is given. Because the displacements are 
lateral and sufficiently large, direct measurements through the optical image system can be easily made to 
collect reasonably accurate data. Operators can perform visual inspection and measurement of small items

(2) Test Structure Fabrication 
At the beginning, instead of comprehensively examining properties in all thin film materials 
generated under various process parameters, only undoped LPCVD polycrystalline silicon thin films and 
PECVD silicon nitride thin films are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 
however the technique is also applicable to any kind of MEMS materials. 
Undoped LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition) polycrystalline silicon are used as 
measured films, which are deposited at 620℃ with a silane (SiH4) flow rate of 40 sccm and a pressure of 
107 mtorr in SRC (Semiconductor Research Center) of NCTU. The polysilicon film thickness is 1.5μm. 
TEOS SiO2 with about thickness of 3μm is used as a sacrificial layer under the suspended beams and 
about o.3μm thick is used as the clearance between the strain gauge and the calibration beam. The 
calibration film is made of CMOS standard nitride provided by SRC with known property data.  The 
nitride film is 1μm thick.  A conventional surface sacrificial-layer micromachining technique is used to 
fabricate the test structures, as shown in Fig. 6. The dimensions of the test structures used herein for 
representative are: the lengths of long and short beams of strain gauges are  500μm and  200μm, 
respectively. The width is 3μm for all beams, the gap distance between the central lines of long and short 
beams equals 4.5μm, and the clearance between the tips of the strain gauge and cantilever is 0.3μm. 
The length of cantilever equals to the short beam (in compressive stress case) or the long beam (in tensile 
stress case). 
 18
(3) Implementation of the thermo-Mechanical Properties Determination  
The block diagram of experimental procedures is outlined in Fig. 7. At the beginning, the sample chip 
with test structures is set on the crucible of the sample holder and put into the heating chamber of the hot 
stage, and then following the experimental procedures. Firstly, RS determination is operated. No heating 
is needed to determine RS. If the measured stress is high, we can determine YM directly without heating, 
and after that, we can perform the annealing process. But, if the measured stress is very low, we must 
heat the basic test structure to react the cantilever beam made of the calibrated film. Secondly, LTEC 
determination is operated. Heating temperature must be below the re-crystallization temperature of the 
measured film, in order to avoid the microstructure of the film change. Finally, TCC is determined by 
applying current to the basic test structure through the wires in the sample holder.
