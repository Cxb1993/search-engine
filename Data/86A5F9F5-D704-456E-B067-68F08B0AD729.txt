   Computers have been used for years in the built environment for many different applications. 
Creation of 3D models for city modeling is becoming common in the architectural practice for 
visualization purposes. The cyberspace provides the opportunity to extend the physical city into 
the digital city. Currently, most 3D digital cities are often created by a collection of huge spatial 
information to represent the real world, but less concern about the interactions between the users 
and the created virtual world. The previous studies found that a digital city is a social information 
infrastructure for urban life, while users or participants within the digital city are often foreign to 
the environment without navigational aids. Therefore, the creation of a digital city that can 
accommodate the social interactions between the users and the created virtual world becomes an 
essential issue. Meanwhile, our previous studies also found that the design of a street as “a 
scenario-based agent system”, critical performance indicators related to user behavior include the 
distribution of visitors across the street, ease of navigation, pedestrian expenditures as a function 
of layout, and functional characteristics of the street scenes. Thus, this study depicts an 
intelligent-agent interface approach for creating a street simulator of user behaviors in urban 
environments.  
   This research offers a rich set of the user interface and extract city information from the 
intelligent-agent system model. We also hope to incorporate other user behaviors into the model, 
so that agents might need to interact with the interface while the user is also interacting with the 
interface and move around in the virtual environment.

Abstract. The urban planning has largely placed the street user at the centre of infra-structural design, 
with significant implications for the perceived attractiveness of user environments. The urban 
designers faced with the task of designing such spaces, needs a tool that will allow different designs to 
be compared in terms of their attractiveness as well as their effectiveness. Therefore, this paper depicts 
an agent interface approach for creating a street simulator of user behaviors in urban street 
environments. We implemented the agent interface as individual-based simulation in the proposed 
project called "SCALE” (A Street Case Library for Environmental design). The project is 
demonstrated to find out differences between the simulation and the existed environment, and the 
methodology is specified. 
1. Introduction 
Computers have been used for years in the built environment and in many different application areas. 
However, it is difficult to simulate social interaction in the dynamic design processes by conventional 
simulation. Social interaction is a powerful mechanism for creating a sense of engagement. In artificial 
intelligence, there is a strong view of agents; they have desires, intentions and can learn, adapt and 
communicate. Agents are autonomous, active computer processes that possess some ability to 
communicate with people and other agents and to adapt their behaviours. Much of this work is concerned 
with activities such as scheduling and controlling computer networks. Indeed, in 1958, Broadbent 
proposed his attention filter theory which specified that we could only attend to one input at a time. The 
theory suggested that stimuli can be filtered based upon physical attributes, prior to full processing by the 
perceptual system. Filter theory proposed that attention was a limited capacity channel that determined the 
serial processing of the perceptual system. Filter theory did not allow for the influence of long-term 
memory or meaning of the stimulus. However, studies showed that semantic characteristics of the stimulus 
did affect attention. In other words, attention filter is applied to catch routine and not-routine behaviors 
groups.: (1) seats, (2) trees, greenery space, (3) signs, (4) shop, (5) parking, (6) public services (toilets, 
etc). The avatar agent perceive these stimuli and act upon them, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.  The main functions of the SCALE system 
 
The simulator as a set of the following individual elements: user behaviors, objects and environments. We 
have identified three underlying properties which are described by the quadruplet: (1) where user 
behaviors are properties of avatar agent, for example, a pedestrian walks, stops, seats and talks; (2) 
objects are the set of all represented passive entities that do not react to stimulus (e.g., street furniture in 
urban spaces); (3) environments are the urban street where agents and objects are located, where they can 
move and act, and (4) where signals propagate, such as sounds, smell, etc. These properties were derived 
from empirical studies of observing pedestrians walking in a shopping street. 
 
3.2. PARaMETeR OF THE BEHAVIOR 
In order to create different categories of behaviour more easily we have identified two underlying 
parameters that contribute to the decision making process of the user. These parameters were determined 
both by video observation and by direct observation of a shopping street. The first is called static 
awareness and is a measure of how far in front the pedestrian perceives changes in the environment. The 
second factor is the desired walking speed of the pedestrian. Thus by changing these values we can easily 
alter the behaviour of each pedestrian in the simulation.  
 
3.3. Attempted evaluation of simulate the pedestrian patterns 
This section reports on a series of simulations – experiments – showing how behavior and environment 
influence each other, from local interactions between individuals and other elements of the environment to 
the emergence of global movement patterns. 
 
3.3.1. Experiment : Simulation Scene  
The experiment presents a series of simple simulation runs to convey the idea that the change of street 
environment can have different effects on movement patterns and the use of space. We create three 
simulation scenarios, differentiated by the space-tags and varying the character of the composed elements. 
In this series we mix three types of pedestrians together in one scene. Each scene has a same number of

Pattern resulting  
The SCALE has the ability to deal with a number of factors including walking speed, pedestrian density, 
and levels of service at quantitative levels. At the subjective or perceptual level (qualitative) the model has 
the capability to represent and simulate subjective aspects of pedestrian behavior which influence both 
random walking behavior and static behavior.   
In other hand, the microscopic modeling approach and emergent behaviour within the model allow not 
only the representation of walking speed but also the property of these variables by a number of attributes 
(for example, gender and age). This property is important because it increases our understanding of a 
number of factors that influence walking speed and density. Therefore, SCALE has an important 
contribution to make to the development of theory as it relates to pedestrian use of street space, 
architectural and design theory, and the further development of the computing application itself.  
 
4.2. The measurement criteria for the behavioral patterns of humans 
 
We have mentioned previously that the development of the behavior rules for the model will encompass 
subjective and objective elements. A measurement issue that still needs to be further investigated in 
SCALE is how to define the nature and attractiveness or unattractiveness of features of the built 
environment for pedestrians. Objective behavior of the pedestrian is that which is directly observable and 
measurable by visual means, for example, through the use of video cameras or time-lapse photography. 
Subjective aspects of behavior include perceptions, past experiences, and attitudes, that is, those factors 
which are unobservable and can help to determine and influence observable pedestrian behavior. 
 
4.3.V visualization of pedestrians’ behavior and activity using agent-based simulators. 
 
We implement some scenarios founded in the pilot studies as computer scripts in the agent-based 
simulators. In such attempts, the work contribute to the understanding of the effects of specific 
interventions and their potential to achieve desired changes in pedestrian mobility, behavior and 
perception. Then by the visualization of hot-points, we succeeded in showing the places where pedestrian 
tend to stay, or pass and analyze the relation between urban space and pedestrians’ activities. Thus, the 
urban designer can test the effects of any design changes through the SCALE simulators on pedestrian 
behaviors before their implementation, and allow us to explore how the layout of urban street space affect 
human behaviors within it, what kinds of factors afford them more enjoyable walking experience. 
Moreover, in the future, comparison with other streets is necessary.
