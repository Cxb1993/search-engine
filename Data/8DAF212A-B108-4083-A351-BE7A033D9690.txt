The Effect of a Concurrent Task on the Walking Performance of Preschool Children 
 
Abstract 
Forty-eight children, aged four to six years, walked while performing or not performing an easy 
or difficult concurrent motor task (carrying a tray with or without marbles on it) or cognitive task 
(repeating a series of digits forwards or backwards).  The temporal distance gait parameters were 
measured using a GAITRite electronic walkway system.  Dual-task costs were calculated as the 
difference between the children’s walking performances with and without the concurrent task.  
Overall, walking alone was easier than walking while performing a concurrent task.  A greater 
dual-task cost was observed when the concurrent task was difficult compared to when it was easy.  
However, this difficulty effect was found for the motor task only.  The results suggest that walking 
demands both the central processing capacity and the domain- and modality-specific processing 
resources in normal four to six year old children.

2. Methods 
2.1. Participants 
Forty-eight typically developing preschool children (26 girls and 22 boys, mean age = 60.1 
months, standard deviation (SD) = 6.9) participated in the study.  They were recruited from a local 
preschool.  The children were free of any developmental delay, and any neurological, orthopedic 
or cardiovascular condition.  They were also mentally equivalent with peers, according to their 
teachers’ reports and were without motor coordination deficits, as assessed by the Movement 
Assessment Battery for Children (Movement ABC) [15].  Movement ABC is a widely used test for 
assessing children’s motor coordination deficits because of its ease of use, high reliability and 
validity [16-18].  Children scoring at or below the 15th percentile rank were considered to have 
some deficit in motor coordination.  The mean body weight of the participating children was 19.9 
kg (SD = 3.4); their mean body height was 109 cm (SD = 5.8) and their mean leg length was 55.6 
cm (SD = 3.7).  All parents gave their consent before their children entered the study, which was 
approved by the local ethics committee. 
2.2. Equipment 
A GAITRite electronic walkway system (CIR Systems Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA) was used to 
measure the temporal distance characteristics of the footsteps of the participants in the study.  The 
system consists of an electronic walkway and a network controller.  The walkway is a 4.6 m long 
and 0.9 m wide electric carpet, with a 3.6 m long and 0.6 m wide active area, which contains 13,824 
sensors.  The system records temporal distance gait parameters such as speed, cadence, stride 
length and others.  The system was chosen for two reasons.  First, it is portable and user friendly 
and, therefore, could be set up easily at school, a more natural environment than a laboratory for 
children.  Second, it demonstrates good reliability (Intraclass Correlation (ICC) between 0.82 and 
0.92) [19,20].  High concurrent validity has also been demonstrated in reference to the Clinical 
Stride Analyzer and the Vicon Motion Analysis system [19,21].  In order to get a steady state of 
walking, we added three m before and after the GAITRite walkway with a marked line, and made 
the whole walking distance around 10 m long. 
2.3. Design and Procedure  
Motor and cognitive concurrent tasks, each with two difficulty levels, were employed.  The 
motor task involved carrying an empty tray (17 cm in diameter and 1.2 cm in depth, easy task), or 
carrying the tray with seven marbles on it (each of 2-cm diameter, difficult task).  Seven marbles 
on the tray had been verified in our pilot study to be difficult enough to cause some interference 
with walking but not impossible therefore allowing the children to keep walking without stopping 
during the experiment.  The cognitive task involved repeating a series of digits forwards (easy) or 
backwards (difficult).  The task was adapted from the digit span task of Wechsler Intelligence 
Scale for Children (WISC) [22,23], which is used to assess children’s working memory capacity.  
The number of digits to be repeated was set at each child’s digit span, which was determined 
individually before the experiment by following the procedure of administering that part of the 
WISC.  The number of digits so determined ranged from four to nine (mean = 6, SD = 1.2) for the 
digits repeated forwards and from two to three (mean = 2.2, SD = 0.4) for the digits repeated 
 6
except base of support (see Table 2 for the supporting statistics).  The interaction effects reflected 
significant effects of difficulty level for the concurrent motor task (p < 0.0001) but not for the 
concurrent cognitive task (p = 0.145 to 0.812).  Specifically, the difficult concurrent motor task 
interfered with walking more than the easy concurrent motor task, whereas the easy and the difficult 
concurrent cognitive tasks were equally interfering.  
The main effects of task type were significant for stride length, double limb support and base of 
support but not for speed and cadence (see Table 2 for the statistics).  Specifically, the concurrent 
motor tasks tended to shorten the stride length and increase the double limb support more than the 
concurrent cognitive tasks.  By contrast, the concurrent cognitive tasks tended to increase the base 
of support more than the concurrent motor tasks.  Further, the concurrent motor tasks and 
concurrent cognitive tasks appeared to bring about similar costs to the speed and cadence of 
walking.  
Table 3 presents the means and SDs of the reaction times measured for the digit forwards (easy) 
and the digit backwards (difficult) tasks when the tasks were performed alone (single task) and 
when performed with walking (dual task).  A two-way repeated-measure ANOVA revealed a 
significant main effect for difficulty (F1,47 = 12.72, p = 0.0009) and for task (F1,47 = 25.92, p < 
0.0001), with no significant interaction effect (F1,47 = 0.20, p = 0.6560).  Reaction times were 
longer for the difficult task than for the easy task.  They were also longer for the dual task than for 
the single task.  
 
4. Discussion 
The present study examined the effects of concurrent motor and cognitive tasks on the usual 
walking performance of typically developing preschool children.  In general, the results showed 
that normal free walking, a very basic and highly practiced task, was affected when the children had 
to carry out a concurrent task.  The concurrent task decreased speed, cadence and stride length, 
and increased double limb support percentage and base of support.  These results were consistent 
with those of Huang et al. and Whitall, who studied fast walking, running and galloping [10,11].  
Our results also showed that the effect of a concurrent task on walking depended on the difficulty 
level of the task and were similar to the results obtained by previous studies [1,8].  The finding that 
the effect of a concurrent task on walking depended to some extent on the type of task is interesting 
but may not be interpreted meaningfully without a proper theoretical perspective.   
The theoretical perspective we adopted was a general information processing approach 
commonly assumed in cognitive science.  We assumed that every task involved the processing of 
information of various sorts and at different levels (e.g. input, central processing, output).  
Information processing consumes attentional resources.  Since attentional resources are limited, 
two tasks will compete for resources if they are carried out at the same time.  They may interfere 
with each other when the total amount of resources demanded exceeds the total supply.  Since the 
attentional resources are unlikely to be unitary, we further adopted the multiple-resource model of 
attention proposed by Wickens [24] as the theoretical framework to explain our results. 
According to Wickens [24], attentional resources are not unitary but rather are divided into 
 8
explaining why carrying the loaded tray should bring forth an adaptation of the child’s gait.   
Clinically, both the double limb support percentage and the base of support reflect balance 
control during gait.  However, our results show that the effects of the concurrent tasks on these two 
parameters display a different pattern.  The dual-task cost on the double limb support percentage 
was significantly greater when the concurrent task was the difficult motor task than when it was 
either of the cognitive tasks (Fig. 1D).  Also, the dual-task cost on the base of support was the 
same whether the concurrent task was the difficult motor task or either of the cognitive tasks (Fig. 
1E).  This suggests that the the double limb support percentage is perhaps more susceptible to gait 
change than the base of support and may serve as a better index of balance control.   
Our study has certain limitations.  First, it is based on a sample drawn from only one preschool.  
Second, we were unable to pinpoint the exact time (or gait event) when the concurrent task 
interference happened.  This was due to the fact that the gait parameters outputted by the 
GAITRite system were averages over time. This limitation made it impossible for us to examine the 
pattern of the dual-task cost on walking during different phases of processing of the concurrent task.  
Finally, we did not examine the developmental trend of the dual-task cost of a concurrent task on 
walking.  Since locomotor coordination and attention control are both developing in children, it 
would be interesting to study the developmental issue of the effect of a concurrent task on walking 
performance in children [25,26].    
In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that children aged four to six years have 
difficulty in maintaining the usual level of their walking performance (manifested by decreased 
walking efficiency and compromised balance control) while they carry out a concurrent motor or 
cognitive task.  Walking while concurrently performing another motor or cognitive task is 
common in children’s everyday activities, e.g. walking while carrying a tray of food or a cup of 
drink, or walking while listening to teachers’ instruction, answering questions and so on.  If 
teachers or parents have knowledge of the cost of a concurrent task on walking, they can choose 
appropriate activities for the children to minimize the dual-task cost and avoid accidental falls.  
For clinicians, understanding the effect of a concurrent task on walking performance may help them 
to design methods of using a dual-task paradigm to evaluate children with a subtle deficit or delay.

The Effects of a Motor and a Cognitive Concurrent Task on Walking in Children with 
Developmental Coordination Disorder 
 
Abstract 
 
The effects of type (cognitive vs. motor) and difficulty level (easy vs. hard) of a concurrent task 
on walking were examined in 10 boys and 4 girls (age 4-6 years) with developmental coordination 
disorder (DCD) and 28 age- and gender-matched unaffected children. Each child performed free 
waking (single task), walking while carrying an empty tray (dual task, the concurrent task being 
motor and easy), walking while carrying a tray with 7 marbles (the concurrent task being motor and 
hard), walking while repeating a series of digits forward (the concurrent task being cognitive and 
easy), and walking while repeating the digits backward (the concurrent task being cognitive and 
hard). Walking was affected by the concurrent task (i.e., dual task cost) in the children with DCD 
more so than in the comparison children. Greater task difficulty also increased the dual-task cost in 
the children with DCD more so than in the comparison children. These patterns were only noted for 
the motor concurrent task. The cognitive concurrent task also affected walking, but the dual task 
costs did not differ between difficulty levels, nor between the groups.

in children with DCD than in comparison children only under a motor concurrent task but not under 
a cognitive concurrent task; and 2) the effect of a motor concurrent task on walking would be larger 
than that of a cognitive concurrent task.  
2. Methods 
2.1. Participants 
Fourteen children with DCD (10 boys and 4 girls; age: 4-6 years) and 28 unaffected children, 
matched for age and gender to be used for comparison, participated in the study. The children with 
DCD were recruited from the Assessment Center for Children with Developmental Delay in a 
University Hospital. To be included for the study, children with DCD had to be free from any other 
developmental delay, neurological, orthopedic or cardiovascular condition except with the motor 
coordination deficit which is usually part of DCD. The diagnosis of DCD was established according 
to the criteria of DSM-IV [1]. Parents and teachers provided the information necessary to determine 
if a child’s motor problem significantly impaired his/her daily living or school activities. The motor 
ability was tested using Movement Assessment Battery for Children (Movement ABC), which 
consists of three categories of tests: manual dexterity, ball skills and balance [18]. Children scoring 
at or lower than the 15th percentile of the total score of the age norm were diagnosed as DCD. DCD 
children with concomitant mental impairment, attentional deficit or hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
were not included. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WIPPSI-R) 
was used to assess the children’s mental ability. The WPPSI-R is one of the major instruments for 
assessing the cognitive ability of young children at the age of 4 years to 7 years and 3 months old 
[19]. It provides verbal IQ, performance IQ and full IQ. Children with verbal IQ lower than 75 were 
excluded from the study.  
Community preschool children were recruited for comparison. They were medically screened 
and determined to be free of any neurological, orthopedic, or cardiovascular disorders. They were 
also tested using Movement ABC where they had to score higher than the 20th percentile of the age 
norm. Although the children in the comparison group did not receive a formal IQ test, they were 
reported by their teachers to be typically developing. The protocol was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board. All guardians gave their consent before their children entered the study.  
2.2. Equipment 
An electronic walkway system (GAITRite, CIR Systems Inc. Clifton, NJ, U.S.A.), with 
established reliability and validity [20,21], was used to measure the temporal distance 
characteristics of walking. In order to obtain a steady state of walking, we added a distance of 3 
meters before and after the walkway and made the whole walking distance approximately 10 
meters.  
2.3. Design and procedure 
We adopted two types of concurrent task (motor vs. cognitive), each with two levels of 
difficulty (easy vs. hard) [15]. Carrying an empty tray, which was 17 cm in diameter and 1.2 cm in 
depth, constituted an easy motor concurrent task. Carrying the tray with 7 marbles in it was a hard 
motor concurrent task. Repeating forward and backward a series of digits of a size appropriated for 
each child’s ability (determined in advance) formed the easy and the hard cognitive concurrent tasks. 
 20
children, but the dual-task cost did not differ between the two difficulty levels and effect patterns 
were similar in the two groups of children (Fig. 2). Analysis of the dual-task cost for other gait 
variables (stride length, speed, and the percentage of double limb support during a gait cycle) 
showed similar results as those for cadence. 
3.2. Performance on the Concurrent Cognitive Task 
The mean and standard deviation of the reaction time measured for the easy and the hard tasks 
when the tasks were performed alone or during walking are presented in Table 2. The results of the 
analysis showed that reaction times were longer for the hard task than for the easy one (F = 29.25, p 
< 0.0001) and longer when the cognitive task was performed with walking than when it was 
performed alone, i.e. there was a significant dual-task cost (F = 31.32, p < 0.0001). However, the 
effect of difficulty level on the reaction time did not differ between groups (F = 0.05, p = 0.8187). 
Similarly, the dual-task costs did not differ between groups (F = 1.59, p = 0.2147). There was no 
significant interaction between difficulty level and group of children on the dual-task cost, either (F 
= 0.04, p = 0.8430). 
4. Discussion 
We examined whether walking may be affected by a concurrently performed cognitive or motor 
task, and whether the effect may differ between children with DCD and those in the comparison 
group. When walking without a concurrent task, the children with DCD did not differ from the 
comparison children. Performing a concurrent task affected walking in both groups of children, 
except when the task was an easy motor one. A hard concurrent task affected walking more than an 
easy one. The dual-task cost was similar in DCD and the comparison children, except when the 
concurrent task was a hard motor one. Under this condition, the children with DCD suffered a 
greater dual-task cost than the comparison children. Interestingly, a concurrent cognitive task, 
whether easy or hard, appeared to have similar effect on walking in DCD and in the comparison 
children. In summary, walking presented an unusual challenge to children when they had to 
simultaneously perform a hard motor task. This challenge was significantly greater for the children 
with DCD than for the comparison children. 
A study on patients with Parkinson’s disease showed that gait performance was not affected by a 
concurrently performed easy motor task (carrying an empty tray like in our study) [13]. However, 
walking deteriorated when the patients had to carry a tray with 4 cups on it. The results of our study 
bear interesting resemblance to those of this study. This is not surprising given that the neurological 
background of DCD may be related to those of basal ganglia or cerebellar dysfunction [22,23].  
Our results may be interpreted with the help of a theoretical model of attention. According to 
this model, attention constitutes a mental resource that supports mental information processing of 
the mind. This mental resource is not a unitary pool, but falls into various pools depending on the 
stage of processing (perceptual, central or response), the codes of processing (verbal or spatial), and 
the modalities of input (visual or auditory) and response (manual or vocal) [17]. Two simultaneous 
tasks would interfere with each other if they compete for the same pool of attention resource and 
there is not enough for both.
