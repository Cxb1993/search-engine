Fig. 1. Relations between working path and FIPP p-cycles.
Consider the example shown in Fig. 1(a), the union of dotted lines forms a
FIPP p-cycle (0-2-3-5-6-8-0). In Fig. 1(b), path (3-7-8) is a straddling work-
ing path and is link-disjoint to the FIPP p-cycle. If link (7-8) or (7-3) fails,
protection paths (8-6-5-3) and (8-0-2-3) can be used as the new working path
and the affected traffic flows can be restored. In Fig. 1(c), path (5-6-8) is an
on-cycle route. If link (5-6) or (6-8) fails, a protection path (5-3-2-0-8) can be
used to restore the path. In Fig. 1(d), path (5-3-2-7-0) overlaps FIPP p-cycle
(0-2-3-5-6-8-0). If link (0-7) or (7-2) fails, protection path (5-3-2-0) can be
used to restore the affected traffic flows. If link (2-3) or (3-5) fails, protection
path (5-6-8-0) can be used to restore the affected traffic flows.
Recently, several studies [4–9] have been focused on the FIPP p-cycles design-
ing problem to ensure that all working paths can be protected against single
link failure. These studies can be classified into two categories: the (non-joint)
spare capacity placement (SCP) problem [4–7] and the joint capacity placement
(JCP) problem [4,5]. For the SCP problem, given a set of working paths, the
goal is to find a set of FIPP p-cycles with minimal capacities to protect it.
For the JCP problem, given a set of connection requests, the goal is to find
the working path for each connection request and a set of FIPP p-cycles to
protect it such that the total capacities can be minimized.
1.2 Backup reprovisioning
Several studies dealt with the multiple-link failure on WDM networks [10–15].
They focused on designing special protection methods so that the working
paths can survive when a multiple-link failure occurred. As networks grow
in size and complexity, both the probability and the impact of failures in-
crease. The pre-allocated backup bandwidth cannot provide 100% protection
guarantee when multiple failures occur in a network.
2
been shown in [21] that shared-path protection with reprovisioning can pro-
vide the same level of robustness compared to dedicated-path protection while
utilizing significantly less capacity.
In [23] backup paths are reassigned from a precomputed path set to opti-
mize the usage of backup capacity. Authors in [24] present a backup reloca-
tion policy to accommodate requests that would otherwise have been rejected
due to limited usage of wavelength converters. In [25], a migration scheme
has been proposed where backup paths are migrated to paths selected from
a set of k pre-computed paths. The light-path re-optimization problem has
been formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) in [26,27]. In [28] a lin-
ear program (LP) formulation is presented, to provide a lower bound on the
required backup resources. Variety of works referred to preemptive reprovi-
sioning schemes also to handle multiple concurrent failures [21,29–32]. In [33]
backup reprovisioning is performed either to affected connections which lose
their primary or backup due to the previous failures or due to backup sharing
(Minimal Backup Reprovisioning, MBR), or to all existing connections (Global
Backup Reprovisioning, GBR). In order to reprovisioning fewer connections
at a time, authors have proposed an algorithm to reprovision connections that
lose their primary paths with new ones after the failure [34]. In [35] it is sug-
gested that reprovisioning is performed after a failure is repaired as well as
after failure occurrence.
3 Assumptions, Notations, and Criteria
In this paper, the physical and virtual topologies of a WDM network, working
paths, disjoint route sets and the set of FIPP p-cycles are fixed and known.
The goal is to design a algorithm to reprovision the backup capacities to the
affected paths after recovering the working paths when a link failure occurred.
Moreover, there are several assumptions:
• For each edge in the physical topology, there is a single fiber connecting the
end-nodes such that data can be transmitted bidirectionally.
• All nodes in the physical network are with wavelength converting capabili-
ties.
• Only the fiber failure scenario is considered.
• The physical topology is two-connected.
• The number of transmitters/receivers of each node is fixed and known.

• Recovery time (RT): RT is the time spent performing the recovery algo-
rithms.
4 Proposed Methods
For the given virtual topology with FIPP p-cycles protection, when a link
fails, all affected working paths are re-routed to their corresponding backup
paths on the FIPP p-cycles. However, since the protection resources of the
FIPP p-cycles may be shared by other unaffected connections, this may cause
working paths becoming unprotected or vulnerable to subsequent failures.
Generally, unprotected connections can be classified into three types [20]: 1)
Indirectly Affected Connections : Upon failure, shared protection resources are
activated by the failed connections which may cause some connections (whose
backup light-paths share these protection resources) to become unprotected. 2)
Directly Affected Working Connections : A failed demand that is re-routed to
its backup is still vulnerable to another failure that may affect its protection
path. 3) Directly Affected Backup Connections : Demands whose protection
connections have failed due to the first failure.
For the backup reprovisioning problem on FIPP p-cycles, the goal is to re-
provide the protecting capabilities of FIPP p-cycles against subsequent fail-
ures. However, it is worth noting that, not all FIPP p-cycles affected by the
failure of a link can be repaired completely. A FIPP p-cycle cannot be re-
paired if there is no available wavelength channel on the fiber which it passes
through. In this situation, a new FIPP p-cycle is needed and used to protect
working paths in the original DRS. If no new FIPP p-cycle can be found, the
DRS should be divided (or partitioned) and then new FIPP p-cycles are found
to protect the DRSs if possible.
Consider the example shown in Fig. 2 and assume CRP is used. Working
path (3-10-6) is protected by the FIPP p-cycle (2-3-5-6-8-0-2). When link (3,
10) fails, the default backup path (3-5-6) is used as the new working path
and the cycle is broken (as shown in Fig. 2(a)). If there are sufficient wave-

4.1 Preprocessing
Before illustrating the proposed methods, some related algorithms are intro-
duced here. In the preprocessing, for each connection (or working path) i, a
set BPi of candidate backup paths is constructed. The paths selected from
BPi can be used to repair a FIPP p-cycle while using CRP or used as the new
working path while using PRP. To construct the set BPi of backup paths, the
link-disjoint path finding algorithm [36] is used to find the set of link-disjoint
paths. Moreover, the set Ci of candidate cycles can be constructed from the
set of backup paths. That is, all possible combinations of the selected paths
in BPi are used to form a set Ci of cycles.
Two protecting flags are used to indicate the status of the working paths. If
a working path is currently protected by a FIPP p-cycle, the protecting flag
of the working path is set to R; Otherwise, the protecting flag of the working
path is set to W . The recovery procedure is applied only for those working
paths with protecting flag R. The details of Preprocessing are described as
follows:
Preprocessing
set the protecting flags of the connections in set P to R;
for connection i, perform link-disjoint path finding algorithm
to find the all link-disjoint paths and construct the set BPi,
i=1, 2, ..., l;
for each connection i,
for all possible combinations of two selected paths in BPi,
combine these paths to form cycles, and construct the set Ci of cycles;
4.2 Outline of the Backup Reprovisioning Recovery Procedure
Assume ej to be the failed link, and Pej and Fej to be the set of affected light-
paths and affected FIPP p-cycles, respectively. The outline of the Backup
Reprovisioning Recovery Procedure is described as follows:
Backup Reprovisioning Recovery Procedure
Input: failed link ej , G, DRS;
Objective:
Recover all working paths and cycles affected by link ej ;
1. Find the sets Pej and Fej affected by failure of link ej .
2. Assume the traffic on working path Pi has been switched to the default backup path. For any connection i in set Pej ,
remove paths in the set BPi, i = 1, 2, ..., l, which are affected by the failure of link ej ;
3. Perform PRP (or CRP) to recover the working paths (or the cycles) so that the working paths in Pej can be protected
if possible.
4. Perform CA to recover the protecting capabilities of cycles in Fej .
4.3 Cycle-Recovery Policy (CRP) Algorithm
This subsection describes the details of the Cycle Recovery Policy (CRP) algo-
rithm. When link ej fails, for connection i, the working path passed through
8
fragmented cycle. If a node-constrained path can be found, then repair the
cycle, set the flag of the connection i to R, and remove connection i from
Pej . Otherwise, perform the Merge Phase.
• Merge Phase: For the selected connection i, if the cycle DCi,1 cannot be
repaired by performing the Recovery Phase, then a cycle in the set DCi is
selected and used to protect connection i and the set of working paths in
M(DCi,1). It is worth noting that, the working path of connection i may
be changed by selecting a path in BPi. For each cycle c in DCi, if the
end nodes of connection i are located on the cycle, find a path from BPi
(or find a new path) which is link-disjoint to all paths M(DCi,1) protected
by the cycle DCi,1. If found, the candidate cycle c is used to protect the
connection, set the flag of the connection to R, and remove connection i
from Pej . Otherwise, perform Redeploy Phase.
• Redeploy Phase: After performing the Recovery and Merge Phases, if cur-
rent cycle cannot be repaired and used to protected connection i, then the
working path of connection i is changed. First, the connection is removed
from the original DRS and the possessed resources are released so that the
original protected cycle can be recovered. Then, the remaining task is find-
ing a cycle to protect the new working path. First the protected cycle is
selected from DCi ∪Ci, if wavelength resources can be used to allocate the
cycle. Otherwise, perform the Node-Constrained Cycle Finding (NCCF ) al-
gorithm (described later) on the current network topology to find a new
cycle. If a node-constrained path can be found, the cycle is used to protect
the working path of connection i and the protecting flag of the connection
is set to R. Otherwise, the protecting flag of the connection is set to W .
The details of CRP algorithm are as follows:

then
{
let path P (DCi,1) be the new working path of connec-
tion i;
use the path p to repair cycle DCi,1;
return TRUE;
}
else
return FALSE;
}
// recover cycle by finding a new path passed through EN
construct set EN of nodes which are the end nodes of work-
ing paths in M(DCi,1) which are not passed by the path
DCi,1 \ P (DCi,1);
perform NCPF algorithm to find a new path p which con-
nects vsi to vdi and passes through all nodes in EN to repair
the cycle DCi,1;
if (found)
then
{
use path p to repair the cycle DCi,1;
return TRUE;
}

then
let path p be the new working path P ′i ;

while (there is an unmarked cycle in DCi ∪ Ci)
{
select an unmark cycle c in DCi ∪ Ci;
if (cycle c can be allocated with free resources)
then
return TRUE;
else
mark c;
}
perform NCCF algorithm to find a new cycle c to protect
path P ′i ;
if (found)
{
DC = DC ∪ c;
set P ′i be the working path of the connection i;
return TRUE;
}
else
{
restoration path to original DCi,1;
return FALSE;
}
END
Two algorithms are used in CRP, they are Node-Constrained Cycle Finding
(NCCF) and Node-Constrained Path Finding (NCPF).
• NCCF: Due to the constraints of the FIPP p-cycles, a FIPP p-cycle must
pass through all end-nodes of working paths in the DRS which it protected.
Assume the set EN contain the end nodes (called essential nodes) of all
the working paths belonging to the same DRS. The NCCF algorithm is
proposed to find a new cycle which passes all nodes in EN . Basically, the
NCCF algorithm is a best-first-search based algorithm. The essential node
in EN will be selected first in order to decrease the number of non-visited
essential nodes. For the node v¯ adjacent to node v, a pv(v¯) value is defined.
The node with the smallest pv will be expanded first. Let rv be the ratio of
the number of adjacent nodes of v in EN to the number of adjacent nodes
of v and renv be the number of unvisited nodes in EN . The pv value of
node v¯ can be computed by the equation shown as follows:
pv(v¯) =

∞, if rv = 0,
(renv − 1)× rv, if v¯ ∈ EN and rv > 0,
renv/rv, otherwise.
The details of the NCCF algorithm are as follows:

is used to replace the broken working path and this one can be found from
the backup path set or be found from the network topology by using the
NCPF algorithm. If the new working path Pi cannot be found, the working
path is removed from M(DCi,1). The Merge and Redeploy Phases of PRP
are similar to the CRP algorithm. The major difference of the Merge and
Redeploy Phases in PRP and CRP is that the new path found in PRP is used
as the new working path of the connection not used to repair the fragmented
cycle in CRP.
The outlines of PRP algorithm are as follows:
Path Recovery Policy (PRP) Algo-
rithm
Input: Gp, DC, DCi, Ci, ej , Pej
Objective: For any connection i in Pej , recover the FIPP
p-cycle DCi,1.
Remove all paths with flag W from Pej .

{
select a connection i from Pej ;

if (working path cannot be recovered successfully)
then
{
perform Merge Phase;
if (connection cannot be recovered successfully)
then
{
perform Redeploy Phase;
if (connection cannot be recovered successfully)
then
set the flag of connection i to W
else
set the flag of connection i to R;
}
else
set the flag of connection i to R;
}
else
set the flag of connection i to R;
remove connection i from Pej ;
}
4.5 Cycle Adjust Algorithm
A link failure may affect FIPP p-cycles such that the cycles become frag-
mented. The CA algorithm is proposed to adjust the cycles so that it can pro-
tect the working paths. The proposed CA algorithm consists of three phases,
they are Recovery Phase, Refind Phase, and Merge Phase. In the Recovery
Phase, the shortest path algorithm is used to find a path to recover the bro-
ken cycle. If no path can be found, the Refind Phase is performed. In the
Refind Phase, the NCCF algorithm is used to find a new FIPP p-cycle which
passes through all end nodes of working paths in M(c), where c is the broken
cycle. It is possible that no cycle can be found to protect the set of the working
paths inM(c), and this may be caused when the number of the working paths
in M(c) is too large. To tackle this problem, the number of working paths in

remove path Pi from M(c);
}
else
{
set protecting flag of connection i to W ;

}
}//end of outer while
END
4.6 Recursive Group Partition
In some cases, a FIPP p-cycle cannot be repaired or DRS cannot be protected
by finding a new FIPP p-cycle. The reason can be that the number (size)
of working paths in DRS is too large. One way to tackle this problem is to
reduce the size of DRS. If the size of DRS can be reduced, then a new FIPP
p-cycle can be found easily. But, on the other hand, using a cycle to protect a
DRS with small size (less than or equal two) may waste wavelength resources.
In RGP, each DRS with size greater than two is tried to find a new cycle to
protect it. For the DRS with size less than or equal two, the DRS is split,
the flag of each connection in DRS is set to W , and the CA Merge Phase is
performed to find cycles to protect it in a more efficient way.
RGP algorithm is used to split the original DRS into smaller ones. Let WP

Fig. 6. Effect of (a) RCR (b) RP with different values of degrees for one simulation.
5.1 Network Settings
For the experiments, WDM networks with 10 nodes, different nodal degrees
{4, 6, 8} (with edges 20, 30, 40), 25 wavelengths, and 30 connections were
generated. All links in the network may fail and the sequences of failed links
were generated randomly. The number of failed links in each experiment is
the same as the number of links in networks. Each experiment with different
failed sequences were examined 20 times and the average result was shown.
5.2 Effect of nodal degree
For the case of static traffic, all connection requests were fixed and known, no
new connection request arrived during the recovering process. Fig. 6 shows the
RCR and RP performance of the proposed methods for networks with different
nodal degrees. To observe the effect of RCR as the number of failed links
increases, 20 simulations were performed. The behaviors of these simulations
are quite similar, the result for one simulation is shown in Fig. 6. Observe the
result shown in Fig. 6(a), it is easily to find that the RCR value decreases as
the number of failed links increases. For the network with nodal degree 4 (6,
or 8), after 10 (22, or 32) links fail, the RCR value reaches to zero. The same
situation arises for RP performance. These may be the reason that there is
20
BR result of one simulation, as the number of failed links increases, and BR
decreases. For the two networks, the BR values for four algorithms are almost
the same. Fig. 8(c) shows the RP result of one simulation, as the number of
failed links increases, and the RP decreases. For the cases, CRP and PRP can
get higher RP than NRP and SRP.
Fig. 9(a) shows the average WER result of the experiments, for the cases,
CRP and PRP can obtain a higher WER than NRP and SRP. Fig. 9(b) shows
the average RSR result of the experiments, for the cases, CRP and PRP can
obtain a higher RSR than NRP and SRP. Fig. 9(c) shows the average RT
result of the experiments, for the cases, CRP and PRP take more time to
recover than NRP and SRP.
6 Conclusions
In this article, the backup reprovisioning problem for FIPP p-cycles on WDM
networks was studied. When a link failure occurs, after applying the recovered
procedure to recover the working paths affected by the failed link. We focus
on how to recover the protecting capabilities of FIPP p-cycles against the
subsequent links failure in WDM networks. Two recovering policies have been
designed to recover the protecting capabilities of the FIPP p-cycles, they are
Cycle Recovery Policy (CRP) and Path Recovery Policy (PRP). In addition,
a new Cycle-Adjust (CA) algorithm has been proposed to recover protect-
ing capabilities of the affected cycles. Simulation results show that CRP and
PRP can perform backup reprovisioning in 0.08 second with WER 0.4. If the
FIPP-DRS-JCP ILP model proposed in [9] was used to redesign the working
paths and the FIPP p-cycles, according to the result of [9], it may need at
least 1.5 hours to obtain an optimal solution (with best WER). Moreover,
it may also result in service disruptions since some primary paths may be
rerouted. It seems impractical for the realistic network management. If ILP
or lP method [25–27] is used for performing backup reprovisioning, the major
restriction is the limitation of the sizes of network, connections, and cycles. As
the sizes increase, the constraints of ILP increases dramatically. The methods
proposed in this paper provides two recovery approaches to solve the backup
reprovisioning problem, for the network with medium size, they perform well.

Abstract—In WDM network, a link failure may cause ser-
vice disruption and may lead to significant information loss.
Especially, when the failed link is on a light-tree that carries
traffic to multiple destinations, the traffic to all the downstream
destinations along the failed link will be affected. Moreover, for
a multicast request, the delay bound associated with it can be
decided according to the emergence degree or priority of the data.
Transmitted data with delay bound reflects the realistic demand
in the future. For a given multicast request with delay bound,
a delay-constrained survivable multicast protection provides the
primary tree and a set of spare resources; when the single-link
failure occurs, the pre-configured spare resources can be used to
construct a new multicast tree under the delay constraint.
In this paper, given a multicast request with delay constraint,
the goal is to allocate the delay-constrained primary multicast
tree and protecting span p-cycles, when the single-link failure
occurs, the multicast tree can be recovered by using protecting
p-cycles such that the backup tree can also satisfy the delay
constraint. This problem is defined as the Delay-Constrained
Survivable Multicast Routing Problem (DCSMRP). The span p-
cycles protection scheme is studied in this paper and a heuristic
method Delay Constrained Span p-cycles Protection (DCSP) is
proposed to solve it. 1

I. INTRODUCTION
There is a growing consensus that the next generation
Internet will employ an IP-over-WDM (wavelength-division-
multiplexing) architecture. In order to provide various appli-
cations on WDM networks, mechanisms must be developed
to handle not only point-to-point communications (or unicast)
but also multicast. Multicast is the transmission of information
from one source to multiple destinations simultaneously. Thus,
issues concerning supporting multicast on WDM networks
need to be studied [1]. For a comprehensive survey, the reader
may refer to [1].
In WDM networks, a fiber can provide tremendous band-
width, so a network failure (such as a fiber cut or node failure)
can lead to a lot of light-paths failed and may cause enormous
data loss. Therefore, several schemes have been proposed to
achieve survivability by protection or restoration in the optical
layer.
1This work was partly supported by the National Science Council (NSC)
of Taiwan, R. O. C. under Grant Number NSC-98-2221-E-018-009.
To guarantee multicast traffic signals can be transmitted
efficiently, transmission delay from the source to all desti-
nations should be limited under a given delay bound. The
delay bound of the multicast can be decided according to
the emergence degree or priority of the data. For the WDM
network with sparse light splitting and without wavelength
conversion, several researchers [2] have studied the delay-
constrained multicast routing problem for minimizing the
number of fibers used or cost. The delay-constrained multicast
routing problem in WDM networks is studied in [3], [4]. The
goal is to minimize a linear combination of communication
cost and wavelength consumption under delay constraint.
The light-tree [1] spanning all multicast members is used to
establish point-to-multipoint connection for supporting multi-
cast traffic. The fiber cut may cause service disruption and
also may lead to heavy loss of significant information. For
the failed link on a light-tree that carries traffic to multiple
destinations, the traffic to all the downstream destinations
along the failed link will be affected. The closer the link is to
the source node, the more destinations will be affected [5].
Multicast protection schemes on WDM networks can be
classified into five major protecting schemes: (1) tree-based
protection [6]–[8]; (2) ring-based protection [9], [10]; (3) path-
based protection [11]–[13]; (4) segment-based protection [13],
[14]; (5) cycle-based protection [5]. The most common method
to protect light-trees for optical multicasting is to deploy a pair
of link-disjoint or arc-disjoint trees (LDTs/ADTs) [7]. For the
ring-based multicast protection approaches, Leelarusmee et al
[10] proposed two methods: one ring for one multicast session
(OFO) and one ring for all multicast sessions (OFA). For the
optimal path-pair protection (OPP) approach, Singhal et al
[13] reported an integer linear programming (ILP) model for
protection of static multicast sessions. Moreover, Singhal et
al also proposed OPP based-shared disjoint path (OPP-SDP)
algorithm. In the OPP approach, a survivable multicast session
is formed by all the link-disjoint primary and backup paths
pairs from the source to every destination.
For unicast traffic protection, the pre-configuration protect-
ing cycle (span p-cycles or p-cycles) [15] is a promising
approach for protecting working capacity in WDM networks.
The p-cycle provides two protection paths to recover the
straddling span and a protection path to recover the on-cycle
span [15]. Moreover, it can achieve ring-like recovery speed
Fig. 1. Delay of backup path (a) on-cycle span, (b) straddling span.
sum of the delays of all edges and denoted as delay(C) =∑
e∈C de. If the edge is an on-cycle span, as the case showed
in Fig.1(a). The counter-clockwise cycle can be used to protect
the edge under the delay constraint if the formula (1) can be
satisfied.
delay(C) + delay(di)− 2× de ≤ ∆, e ∈ Tr (1)
It is worth noting that, not all cycles can be used to protect
the on-cycle span due to the cycle is unidirectional.
If the edge is a straddling span of the protecting cycle, as
the illustration showed in Fig.1(b). The cycle can be used to
protect the edge under the delay constraint if the formula (2)
can be satisfied,
delay(eˆ) + delay(di)− de ≤ ∆, e ∈ Tr, (2)
where delay(eˆ) is the delay of the default backup path on
cycle.
First, let the initial value of the integral variable k be zero,
the Dijkstra-based least-delay tree algorithm (LDTA) is used
to find the primary multicast tree T 0r . If delay-constrained tree
T 0r cannot be found, the request is blocked and return.
At the kth iteration, for the current primary multicast tree
T kr (0 ≤ k ≤ K), if the protecting cycles cannot be found
for all edges in T kr , then another primary tree T
k+1
r whose
delay is slightly larger than current one is used as the new
primary multicast tree. Then another set of protecting cycles
are found to protect all edges on new tree T k+1r . To find a
new multicast tree, the kth(1 ≤ k ≤ K ≤ n−1) largest delay
edge of the primary tree T 0r is removed from the topology G
and form Gk, then LDTA is performed to find a multicast tree
T kr under delay constraint on G
k. If T kr is found, then find
a set cycles to protect all edges on tree T kr . If all edges can
be protected by the set of cycles under delay constraint then
return. Otherwise, if k < K, increase k by one and repeat the
process to find a new tree T kr and protecting cycles. If trees
T kr and cycles cannot be found in all the cases 0 ≤ k ≤ K,
the multicast request is blocked. The details of the DCSPPA
is known as follows.

request. For the DCDTP, a primary multicast tree and a bi-
directional path which connected source to all destinations on
the leaves of primary multicast tree are used to protect the
multicast request.
The results (in Fig.5(b)) show that the BR value of DCDTP
rapidly increases from 25% to 69% as the number of requests
increases, and is worse than that of DCSP (30%–40%). Thus
BR value provided by the DCSP method is comparatively
stable and better than that of the DCLTP. The computational
complexity of the DCLTP, DCDTP, and DCSP is O(K|V |3),
O((K + |D|)|V |3), and O((K + |D|+ 2)|V |3), respectively.
The result in Fig.8(a) shows that RUR value increases as the ∆
decreases for R = 40 . The RUR and WER of DCSP values
are better than that of DCLTP and DCDTP in the cases of
∆ < 7.0 (as shown in Fig.8).
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we define and study the Delay-Constrained
Survivable Multicast Routing Problem (DCSMRP). The span
p-cycles protection scheme is used and a heuristic algorithm
Delay Constrained Span p-cycles Protection (DCSP) method
is proposed to solve it. Simulations show that the value of BR
of DCSP is worse than DCDTP but better than DCLTP when
network with enough wavelength resources.
