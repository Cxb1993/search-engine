2knowledge, such as fear of losing superiority arising due to ownership of the specific knowledge,
perception of not being adequately rewarded for a knowledge sharing action, and the lack of time
and resources that the individual has to affect such a transfer. On the basis of Amabile (1993),
extrinsic motivation fosters straightforward applications of technical knowledge and arguably the
sharing of known technical information is of considerable value to organizations, suggesting it
appears possible to apply rewards in ways that support rather than undermine intrinsic motivation
in behalf of knowledge sharing. However, the NPD literature currently offers little prescriptive
advice in the use of reward systems in innovative knowledge sharing among NPD team members.
By exploring the use of joint reward system (JRS) in NPD team context, this research helps
develop a foundation for such advice as well as for future theoretical development.
Relatedly, despite rewards contingent on knowledge sharing will have a positive effect on the
extent of knowledge that individuals contribute to databases (Bartol and Srivastava 2002),
previous studies have examined its effect on NPD process with little attention to its possible
moderating effect on developing a strong team-based superordinate identity, which has been
justified in overriding the detrimental effect of functional identities and the resulting
cross-functional biases and stereotypes in NPD teams.
Accordingly, this research deals with these gaps by developing a theoretical framework that
pertains to two research issues in which three main constructs were addressed: cross-functional
NPD teams’competencies, joint reward system, and innovative knowledge sharing. The first
issue is focus on how and the extent to which the team-based competencies affect innovative
knowledge sharing, and the second examines the contextual influence of a team-level JRS on the
relationship between team-based competencies and innovative knowledge sharing. We begin by
defining innovative knowledge sharing and proposing our conceptual framework that links the
three main constructs mentioned previously. We then elucidate the methods and measures we
used to test the framework. Following the empirical results, we close with a discussion of the
results in terms of their theoretical, managerial, and further research implications.
2. Conceptualizing Background and Research Hypotheses
2.1 Conceptualizing Innovative Knowledge Sharing
The notion of“innovative new product knowledge”provides the foundation for our definition of
innovative knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing refers to individuals sharing organizationally
relevant information, ideas, suggestions, and expertise with one another in communication with
others (Bartol and Srivastava 2002). As suggested by Sethi, Smith, and Park (2001), and Im and
Workman Jr. (2004), firstly we conceptualized innovativeness in terms of the “output
perspective”of creativity, which identifies two distinctive dimensions of creativity: novelty and
appropriateness. Additionally, because learning about customer preferences occurs in both NPD
phases but entails lower costs and lower strategic risk in the pre-launch phase—namely idea
generation, concept refinement, product development, and product testing (Joshi and Sharma
2004), we focus on innovative knowledge sharing in the pre-launch phase of new product

NPD team competencies. According to literature of strategic management theory (Hill and
Jones 2007), distinctive competencies are firm-specific strengths that allow a firm to differentiate
its product and/or achieve substantial cost down and thus gain a competitive advantage, which in
turn will result in superior profitability and profit growth. It is generally recognized that
distinctive competencies arise from two complementary sources: resources and capabilities.
Drawing on the “resources-capabilities”framework, we defined a team-specific combination
of distinctive competencies. We contend that superordinate identity actually captures the
intangible resource aspect of NPD teams. Superordinate identity refers to the extent which
members identify with the team rather than merely with their functional areas and perceive a
stake in the success of the team (Sethi 200b). Evidences suggested that barriers to
cross-functional integration might be resulted form the people themselves and the firm-related
factors, but to a large extent arise from deeply rooted functional identity that members hold
(Ashforth and Mael 1989). Because superordinate identity (1) leads a sense of team identity to
replace functional identities, (2) is a nonphysical entity that is created by team members through
overcoming biases and stereotypes toward another functions, (3) would exhibit complex
relationships with other team-specific resources and capabilities, and (4) would enhance the
difficulty of competitor imitation (Lado, Boyd, and Wright 1992), it can be viewed as one of the
most salient intangible resources for innovation knowledge sharing in NPD process.
Furthermore, we extend the perspectives of Atuahene-Gima (2005), conceptualizing team
capabilities as two components of market-oriented characteristics: lead users involvement and
competitor orientation. Lead users involvement refers to the extent to which the input and
feedback from lead users was relied on in the pre-launch phase of new product development.
Competitor orientation refers to a seller understands the short-term strengths and weaknesses and
6Drawing upon the arguments of Chang, Yeh, and Yeh (2007) and Chang, Yeh, and Lin (2007),
we use two conceptually related components to conceptualize the application of JRS in
team-level. The first component of JRS, joint determination of reward allocation, is the extent to
which functional members within a team together determine the allocation of rewards from
successful launch of a new product. The second, risk-free to participants, refers to the extent to
which team members perceived that senior management’s attitudes in encouraging risk-taking,
supporting entrepreneurial spirits, and tolerating of initial failures were deployed across the
design of JRS.
2.3 Effects of Team Competencies
Superordinate identity. By bring together different functional representatives and assigning
them responsibility for new product development or innovativeness, cross-functional new product
teams foster both information flow and synergistic coordination, thereby enhancing strategic
flexibility or responsive to customer feedback in the new product development process (Nonaka
and Takeuchi 1995). Such strategic flexibility or responsiveness requires both the rapid
dissemination of market knowledge to the different functional representatives in a team and a
synergistic coordinated response by the representatives to this knowledge (Brown and Eisenhardt
1995). The empirical evidences show that the effectiveness of this feedback process depends
highly on the level of achieved integration or integration capability of diverse perspectives in
cross-functional teams (Griffin and Hauser 1996). However, cross-functional integration is
generally an exception rather than a rule (Griffin and Hauser 1996). Thus, unless functional
identities are replaced by a sense of superordinate (or team) identity, it may be difficult for team
members to discover critical novel linkages among diverse perspectives (Sethi 2000b; Sethi,
Smith, and Park 2001) and to provide meaningful innovativeness to customers.
Superordinate identity is expected to play a promising role in cross-functional integration the
resulting innovative knowledge sharing. Teams with high superordinate identity are more likely
to remove cross-functional barriers derived from functional identities, biases, and stereotypes
(Griffin and Hauser 1996). Thus, team members in a high superordinate identity team are tend to
view themselves as an integrated part of the team, which usually leads to psychological
acceptance of other members, their work methods, and their goals. Consequently, team members
are more willing to share information, to carefully to attend to each other’s perspectives during
decision-making, and to constructively challenge these perspectives and their underlying
assumptions (Maltz and Kohli 1996; Sethi 2000b), thereby increasing the likelihood of
systematical integrating of functional resources and expertise and then enhancing innovative
knowledge sharing to response the feedback from market place in new product development
process.
Additionally, members in a high superordinate identity team are more willing to view the
success of the team as personal stake, which motives them to review, to think, and to do what is
beneficial for the team. Such a feeling or an emotion of psychological ownership of the team
arises among team members can override the adverse effects of their functional identities and
8Competitor orientation. Competitor orientation is viewed as a firm’s capability to identify,
analyze, and respond to competitors’weakness and strengths, which actually enhances
organizational intelligence of market-wide knowledge (Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Narver and
Slater 1990). As suggestions by Marinova (2004), if NPD team members perceive movement on
the part of their key competitors, they are more likely to expend effort innovating than they
would in the absence of competitors’actions. Furthermore, it has been strongly argued that with
deeper knowledge of the current and future competitors, managers become dissatisfied with the
inadequacies of current capabilities, which results in investments in new capabilities and
insightful strategic change (Atuahene-Gima 2005).
By continuously monitoring against competitors’progress to capture the market and industry
trends, a competitor-orientated NPD team can refine novel and meaningful new ideas and then
lead to opportunities to provide new products to respond customers’needs (e.g., Im and Workman
Jr. 2004). Additionally, because competitors often try to emulate the performance of successful
others (Dickson 1992), a competitor-oriented team is more capable of catching opportunities to
create products or programs that are differentiated from those of competitors, which certainly
infuses knowledge of both marketplace and industry-wide into the NPD process than the others.
Thus we argue that competitor orientation should be viewed as a fundamental building block of
knowledge creation and thereby enhancing innovative knowledge sharing. Based on the
preceding, it is proposed that competitor orientation promotes the innovative knowledge sharing
at NPD team level and facilitates meaningful innovations at firm level whereby the
competitor-oriented firm can stay ahead of competitors’innovations. Thus we hypothesize that
H3: The level of competitor orientation in a cross-functional product development team is
positively related to innovative knowledge sharing among NPD team members.
2.4 Effects of JRS
Researchers who study compensation strategy indicated that the relationships among
compensation, level of functional integration, and firm success are likely to go hand in hand
(Griffin and Hauser, 1996; Sarin and Mahajan, 2001; Kanter 1988). They further noted that JRS
in the team level was one of the most important integrative mechanisms to gain NPD
performance. Particularly, Coombs and Gomez-Mejia (1991) strongly suggested that perhaps the
single most important factor contributing to the cross-functional integration and information
sharing is how rewards are allocated across these different functions. Therefore, there is an
increasing emphasis in firms pursuing leading-edge that compensation strategies need to be
developed that taking the essential interdependencies among functions involved in NPD process
into account.
As we noted previously, unless team members have a positively response to the question,
“What’s in it for me?”cross-functional integration and the resulting knowledge sharing behavior
are less likely to emerge. Nevertheless, current compensation systems overtly favor the technical
professional or R&D member in NPD teams for the perceived critical role in the survival of the
firm they play. Although special payment for R&D personnel may be compatible for some
10
Risk-free to participants. Management’s attitudes, such as encouraging risk-taking and
entrepreneurial character and/or behaviors, and tolerating for failures in NPD process, were found
to have a positive effect on achieving the higher level of cross-functional integration and
enhancing innovation performance (Pascarella 1997; Bartol and Srivastava 2002). In nature, these
attitudes convey a strong signal to all NPD team members that an entrepreneurial failure in NPD
process will be tolerated. To promote innovation, risk-free entrepreneurial funds aim to start new
projects or ventures are frequently used for D&D function (Coombs and Gomez-Mejia 1991).
However, they further noted that similar programs should extend into the production and
marketing arena to develop creative ways of producing and commercializing the firm’s product.
Innovation is intrinsically an adventure in which considerable time lag between the efforts
made by the NPD teams and the market outcomes. While risk-taking or being entrepreneurship is
positive drives for NPD success, NPD team members are also capable of weighting risks between
those of their organization and those of their own (Sarin and Mahajan, 2001). Team members
may be willing to share risk with their organizations, however, they are more eager to minimize
their risk exposure or to secure a risk-free position (Sasaki, 1991; Sarin and Mahajan, 2001). If
NPD teams are put into positions to move organizations forward by taking risk, it’s unfair to
reward them solely on the basis of results (Pascarella, 1997), particularly for the production and
marketing member in NPD teams. Robbins and Finley (1995) noted that NPD team members
would not invest their best efforts to carry out business objectives if they are placed at risk. The
agency theory also echoes that an optimal compensation system is contingent on the need to
balance an agent’s (NPD team’s) effort and risk aversion (Bloom and Milkovich, 1998). On the
basis of the preceding, we contend that if a team-level JRS that is expected to facilitate
cross-functional integration and the resulting innovative knowledge sharing should be
characterized by minimal risks or risk-free to the NPD team members. Thus, we hypothesize the
following
H5: Risk-free to participants in a team-level JRS is positively related to innovative knowledge
sharing among NPD team members.
The moderating effect of JRS. A team-level JRS characterized by joint determination of
reward allocation and risk-free to participants shape a contextual surrounding in which NPD team
members perceived they are being treated fairly, and such a perception of internal equity could
strengthen the main effect of superordinate identity on innovative knowledge sharing. Because
when making relational justice judgments, drawing upon the perspectives group-value model in
justice theory (Huo et al. 1996, p. 40), people consider three issues: feelings that authorities’
motives or intentions can be trusted (benevolence), beliefs that authorities’actions are based on a
nonbiased consideration of facts (neutrality), and feelings that authorities treat them with the
dignity and respect appropriate for full group members (status recognition). When people feel
that they are treated with benevolence, a lack of bias, and respect, their sense of self-worth is
bolstered and their attachment to the group is reaffirmed.
Consequently, we contend that the positive effect of superordinate identity on innovative
12
study on the issues presented in our framework is reasonable and acceptable theoretically.
In Phase 1, we conducted a series of qualitative field interviews and focus group meetings in
the first year. Fifteen NPD executives across six industries and several academics were
interviewed, all of whom had experience with practical new product development process. The
purposes of this phase are to refine (1) the original conceptual framework as presented in Figure 1,
(2) the conceptualization or content of the three components in our conceptual
framework—namely cross-functional NPD team’s distinctive competencies, joint reward system,
and innovative knowledge sharing; specifically, the first two constructs, and (3) the patterns of
relationships presented in our original conceptual framework. In total, we completed
approximately 50 hours of interviews to gain a general understanding about constructs mentioned
above they experienced in their firms. The data collected during this phase were used to establish
both the external and internal validity of the conceptual framework, generate preliminary
hypotheses and measure items, and pretest the survey questionnaire used in the second phase
(The Year 2) of data collection.
In phase 2, we tested hypotheses using data collected through a survey from key informants
involved in recent new product initiatives, following similar key informant research process
suggested by Sethi, Smith, and Park (2001). In this study, the key informant was the individual
who was an active participant and responsible for a recent new product development project in
their firms. Because of their considerable experience in using cross-functional team in the NPD
process, high-tech industries operating in Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park, and Nantze Economic Processing Zone in Taiwan were chosen as
the context for our study. Due to budgetary or other constraints, we randomly select 100 firms for
survey. Several interviewers scheduled appointments with two key informants in each firm,
presented the questionnaire to them, and collected the questionnaire after completion. Of the 100
firms in the database, we made contact with 625. Of these 625, 600 expressed an interest in the
study and agreed to participate. Having contacted these potential participants, we sent them one
copy of the questionnaire. We closed the survey four weeks after the two-round telephone contact,
having received 236 completed responses from 600 potential participants.
3.2 Measures
When possible, existing measures of the constructs were used. For the newly developed measures,
we created a pool of items based on the existing literature and our interviews. We submitted the
preliminary scales to qualitative pretest in interviews with marketing executives and academics,
who proposed refinements, modifications, and new items in our Phase 1 study. We then
conducted a small sample survey of NPD team members and MBA students to refine the scales.
Having modified some items based on the pretest results, we believed that the questionnaire was
ready for large-scale administration. Because of the exploratory nature of this study and the
importance of the individual in knowledge sharing activities (Nonaka 1994; Nonaka and
Takeuchi 1995), we focus on the individual as the unit of analysis. The mean, standard deviation
and correlations for each refined measure are shown in Table 2. Appendix A illustrates the survey
14
the extent to which team members perceived that they were encouraged to be venturesome and to
pursue unique and untried ideas. The measure is a two-item, seven-point Likert-type scale based
on a measure proposed by Sethi, Smith, and Park (2001).

3.3 Validation of Measures
By using an exploratory factor analysis with principal components extraction and varimax
rotation, we deleted items with low item-to-total correlations, as well as that exhibited significant
cross-loadings and/or did not load significantly on their assigned factor. Having examined the
measurement model fit, the data was submitted to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
The first CFA model examined the validity of the antecedents in the research model,
including all constructs used to examine the effect of team competencies on innovative
knowledge sharing (i.e., superordinate identity, lead users involvement, competitor orientation,
and innovative knowledge sharing), through structural equation modeling with LISREL. The
results show that despite a statistically significant chi-square (χ2 = 100.74, p＜.05), the other fit
indexes (goodness-of fit index [GFI] = .93, GFI adjusted for degree of freedom [AGFI] = .89,
comparative fit index [CFI] = .96, normed fit index [NFI] = .947, nonnormed fit index [NNFI]
= .944) provided evidence of a good fit of the model to the data, thereby confirming the validity
of the measures of the antecedent constructs. In the second CFA model, we included the
remaining two JRS constructs—namely, joint determination of reward allocation and risk-free to
participants. Again, the results indicated good fit of the confirmatory measurement model of our
constructs (GFI = .90, AGFI = .87, comparative fit index [CFI] = .95, NFI = .90, nonnormed fit
index [NNFI] = .91). Furthermore, in both CFA models, all items loaded on their respective
constructs were statistically significant (p＜.001).
3.4 Test of Common Method/Source Bias
Because we collected the data from the same respondent using the same format of questionnaire
in measuring both dependent and independent variables, the potential for common method
variance may be of concern. To assess the manifestation of this problem, we used the Harman’s
single-factor test on the items as suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986). The results of a
principal components factor analysis show six factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1. These

4.2 Effects of Antecedents and Moderators on Innovative Knowledge Sharing
We expected that superordinate identity would have a positive effect on innovation knowledge
sharing. The results show that the relationship is significant and positive, thus H1 (b = .65, t =
5.79, p.001) was supported. H2, which predicted a positive impact of lead users involvement on
innovation knowledge sharing, is supported significantly (b = .11, t = 2.65, p.01). Competitor
orientation was found positively related to innovation knowledge sharing as expected (b = .15, t =
2.72, p.01), thus H3 is supported.
Regarding the effect of moderators, contrary to our expectation that joint determination of
reward allocation in JRS has a positive impact on innovation knowledge sharing, we find no such
a effect (b = －.15, t = －.85, p＝.40), thus there is no support for H4. Consistent with our
expectation, risk-free to participants in JRS is positively related to innovation knowledge sharing
(b = .66, t = 3.61, p.001), thus H5 is supported.
4.3 Moderating Effects of JRS
We hypothesized joint determination of reward allocation in JRS to strengthen the positive main
effect of superordinate identity. However, the interaction coefficient between joint determination
of reward allocation and superordinate identity is not significant (b = .03, t = .93, p＝.35). Thus
H6 is not supported. Contrary to our expectation that risk-free to participants in JRS has a
strengthening effect of on the relationship between superordinate identity and innovation
knowledge sharing, we find a significant and negative moderating effect (b = －.11, t = －3.45,
p.001), thus there is no support for H7.
As indicated the simple slope analysis in Table 4, when the levels of risk-free to participants
increases form low to high, the slopes of equations capturing the positive effects of superordinate
identity on innovation knowledge sharing became progressively decreased [.80(low)
→.65(median)→.50(high)]. Such result suggests that risk-free to participants in fact mitigates the
effect of superordinate identity on innovation knowledge sharing.

5. Conclusions and Discussion
In this research, we deal with two issues of (1) whether team-based competencies—namely
superordinate identity, lead users involvement, and customer orientation, can facilitate innovative
knowledge sharing within NPD teams, and (2) whether contextual influences of joint reward
18
common practice among high–tech firms in Taiwan.
Forth, while expecting risk-free to participate in JRS would strengthen the positive impact of
superordinate identity on innovative knowledge sharing, the empirical result indicated an
opposite direction with statistical significance. The regression results have shown that risk-free to
participate in JRS in fact mitigates the relationship between superordinate identity and innovative
knowledge sharing. It is likely that while risk-free to participate have shown positive effect on
innovative knowledge sharing since a worry-free situation may stimulate knowledge sharing.
However, the situation of overstate the“risk-free”atmosphere in NPD process may lead the NPD
team members to overlook the fact that the success of launching new product to marketplace is
built on a building block that comprises collaboration and corporation within NPD team members
and across their functional areas. That is, when the“risk-free reward”atmosphere in NPD process
was overemphasized, it could undermine the willingness of team members share their unique
knowledge to others.
5.1 Limitations
There are two primary limitations to this research. First, this research is intrinsically focused on
internal dynamics within NPD teams. We proposed three variables related to team competencies
that are expected to play an important role in affecting internal team dynamics and thereby
influencing innovative knowledge sharing of NPD teams. However, factor related to
organizational structure and cultures are also expected to impact innovative outcomes (Brown
and Eisenhardt 1997). Although we have considered some organizational variables, such as
resource availability in the firm, management attitude to encouragement to take risk, and
mechanisms of JRS, as contextual influences or as covariates, there are other organizational
factors that we have not considered. Incorporating more relevant organizational factors into our
framework can help managerial decisions in designing and developing suitable organizational
structure and cultures to promoting innovative knowledge sharing among team members. Second,
we focused on three team-level variables and, based on the“resources-capabilities”framework of
competencies perspective, conceptualized them as the antecedents of innovative knowledge
sharing. Although these variables are interesting and important constructs that have a great
potential for stimulating future theoretical development, they are not the only ones possible.
5.2 Managerial Implications
The findings of this research have two implications for managerial decisions. First, our
theoretical framework and empirical findings provide several insights into and increase our
understanding of how each of three antecedents and of two mechanisms of JRS affects innovative
knowledge sharing within NPD teams. Because these constructs are managerially controllable,
we hope that this knowledge is useful to both firms and NPD project managers in managing the
cross-functional interface and enhancing innovative knowledge sharing.
Second, this research informs managers that creating a strong superordinate identity within
NPD teams can reduce the adverse effect of functional identities, and that risk-free to participants
