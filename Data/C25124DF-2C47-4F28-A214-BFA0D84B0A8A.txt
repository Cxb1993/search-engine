Abstract
In this study, we mixed blue-green and orange-yellow phosphors to perform the white light
emission; in the meantime, the white electroluminescence (EL) light source was prepared. The
blue-green phosphor was prepared by SrS:CeF3 and SrS:CeO2. The orange-yellow phosphor was
prepared by ZnS:MnO2. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) and strontium sulfide (SrS) phosphors were prepared
using solid state sintering method and doped with MnO2 (0.6 mol%), CeF3 (2.0 mol%) and CeO2
(1.5 mol%), respectively. The optima emission efficiency of phosphor was achieved when the
phosphors were synthesized at temperature 1200℃ for 1 hour under N2 atmosphere. The
crystallization, photoluminescence (PL) and EL properties of the phosphors and devices will be
discussed.

1. Intorduction
Phosphors are materials that emit photons with high efficiency, which contain a chief material
(host) with a bit of dopants (activators). These materials mostly are II-VI semiconductor
compounds; the host is a composition of the II elements of Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd or Hg with the VI
elements of O, S and Se [1-3]. The phosphors of zinc sulfide (ZnS) and strontium sulfide (SrS)
are kinds of II-VI sulfide compounds with bandgaps of 3.66 and 4.32 eV, respectively. With this
large band-gap, various radiation wavelengths could be obtained by doping transition or rare
earth metal ions. The traditional dopants are Mn, Cu, Eu and Ag. The dopants are usually
4fabricated after the white light phosphors was prepared, which was manufactured with the
screen-printing technology as well by using poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as the substrate.
Its structure includes PET, phosphor, insulator and electrode layers.
A Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and a
monochrometer was used to evaluate the PL and PL excitation (PLE) spectra. It was measured at
room temperature and at a scanning range of 300 to 700 nm. The surface morphology of the
phosphor was evaluated by a JEOL 6330 TF field emission electron microscope (SEM). The
crystalline phase was analyzed by a SIEMENS D5000 X-ray diffraction (XRD) system with Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) and recorded in the rangeof 2θ = 10°–70° with increments of 0.1°.
The CIE color coordinates and luminance intensity were measured with a colorimeter (Minolta
CS-100A, Japan). The electroluminescence spectra were measured using the OSM-400 series
fluorescence-spectrophotometer biased with an AC power source at 1000 Hz.
3. Results and Discussion
(A) Properties of the ZnS:Mn phosphor
Figure 1 shows the crystallization property of the ZnS:Mn phosphor. It is found that the
ZnS:Mn phosphor was almost hexagonal structure, the main crystalline plane was H(101).
Surface morphologies and grain sizes for the ZnS phosphor doped with different concentrations
of Mn were shown in Fig. 2. It reveals that the grain size was about 2 μm, however, the particle
size of the ZnS:Mn phosphor was reduced while the doping concentration of Mn increases. That
was owing to the crystallization of ZnS:Mn decayed for a higher Mn doping concentration.

the Mn concentration was at 0.6 mol%. A decreased PL intensity was measured as the Mn
concentration was higher than 0.6 mol% because of the decayed crystallization and the quench
effect of the ZnS:Mn phosphor. The dependence of the PL intensity and the Mn doping
concentration for the ZnS phosphor is displayed in Fig. 3(b). The emission photograph for the
ZnS:Mn phosphor excited with a 6 W of ultraviolet (UV) lamp is shown in Fig. 4(a), the CIE
coordinates, x = 0.44 and y = 0.43, are exhibited in Fig. 4(b).
(B) Properties of the SrS:Ce phosphor
The crystallization property of the SrS phosphor doped with CeO2 and CeF3 are shown in
Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The plane of C(220) was the dominant crystalline plane. It is
found that the crystallization property of the SrS phosphor was modified when different cerium
compounds were doped; it is expected that the PL and EL characteristics of the SrS:Ce phosphor
will be changed as well. The SEM photographs for the SrS doped with CeO2 and CeF3 were
exhibited in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. It is observed that larger and harder grains of the
SrS:Ce phosphor was synthesized; the grain size was approximately 10 μm.
Figure 7(a) and (b) show the emission spectra measured at room temperature for SrS
phosphor doped with CeO2 and CeF3 respectively, where the doping concentrations CeO2 and
CeF3 were correspondingly varied from 1.1－2.0 mol% and 1.1－2.3 mol%. In these PL emission
spectra, it is observed that the luminescence peak of SrS phosphor doped with Ce was at 469 nm,
it was blue-green emission. In additional, it is shown that the emission peak of ZnS:Ce phosphor
was not varied as the doped cerium compounds were changed. Nevertheless, the PL intensity was
varied with the Ce doping concentration. The optimal PL intensities would be obtained while the
ZnS was doped with 1.5 mol% of CeO2 and 2.0 mol% of CeF3. The PL emission photograph for
the SrS phosphor doped with CeO2 and excited with a 6 W of ultraviolet (UV) lamp is shown in
8However, when mixing ratio reduced to 0.1:1, it was changed to blue-white emission.
Nevertheless, when the mixing ratio of ZnS:Mn to SrS:CeO2 were 0.3:1 and 0.1:1, yellow-white
and white emissions were achieved, respectively.
Figure 10 shows the emission photographs and CIE color coordinates of the ZnS:Mn mixed
SrS:Ce phosphors measured with a colorimeter excited by an ultraviolet (UV) lamp. Figure 10(a)
is the emission photograph for ZnS:Mn mixing SrS doped with CeF3 and Fig. 10(b) is ZnS:Mn
mixing SrS doped with CeO2. These figures show that a near pure white emission was obtained.
The white emission was obtained when ZnS:Mn mixing SrS:Ce was by 0.5:1, the CIE
coordinates shown in Fig. 10(c) was (0.26, 0.36).
The white EL light source was fabricated after the white light phosphors was prepared,
which was manufactured with the screen-printing technology by using poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) as substrate. Its structure includes PET, phosphor, insulator and electrode

method. From the analyses of PL spectra, it reveals that the ZnS:Mn phosphors were
yellow-orange emission and the SrS:Ce phosphors were blue-green emission with wavelengths at
around 567 and 469 nm, respectively. When the Mn was doped into ZnS by 0.6 mol% and Ce
was doped into SrS by 2.0 mol%, the optimal PL intensity was obtained. From this study, it
exhibits that a white light emission was obtained when the SrS:Ce was mixed with ZnS:Mn
phosphor by 1:0.1 weight percent ratio. The EL performance of the white ZnS:Mn mixed SrS:Ce
EL device was evaluated under applied voltage and current at 400 V and 60 mA, respectively.
The white emission color was observed. Three papers related to this study have been submitted to
the following conferences: Conference on Microelectronics Technology and Applications 2007,
Optics and Photonics in Taiwan (OPT) 2007, and Chinese Society for Materials Science (CSMS)
2007.

Abstract 
The luminescence enhancement mechanism of a white ZnGa2O4 phosphor screen with an In2O3 buffer layer was 
studied by growing ZnGa2O4 with optimal sputtering parameters and varying the deposition conditions of In2O3. A 
ZnGa2O4 film with better crystallization and smaller grains was obtained when it was deposited on In2O3. These 
qualities revealed that the resistivity of the phosphor screen was correlated with the surface roughness and resistivity of 
the In2O3 buffer layer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the phosphor screen revealed that the ligand field of the 
Ga luminescence center was not modified when the In2O3 deposition parameters were varied; however, the emission 
intensities were altered owing to the electron transition probability in the Ga energy levels changing with the 
crystallization of phosphor. A significantly enhanced emission from the phosphor screen was observed by improving the 
crystallization, surface morphology, and resistivity of the prepared ZnGa2O4 phosphor film with the In2O3 buffer layer.  
 
Introduction 
Field emission display (FED) technology has 
received considerable attention in recent years.1,2 Some 
believe that FED has the potential to achieve ultrahigh 
definition and wide-screen televisions and that it will be 
the biggest threat to the liquid crystal display (LCD) in 
the flat panel display (FPD) arena. The operation of the 
FED is similar to that of the cathode ray tube (CRT) in 
which phosphor is excited by a stream of electrons 
traveling through a vacuum.3 Therefore, the performance 
of FEDs is related to the electron-emission ability of the 
field emitter array (FEA) and the luminescence 
efficiency of the phosphor screen. Considerable efforts 
have been devoted to the commercialization of FEDs; 
nevertheless, studies for developing high-performance 
FEDs have not been halted. At present, fabrication 
technologies of FEAs and phosphor screens are being 
progressively improved and the preparation of potential 
materials for the application of FEDs is in progress.

roughness of 11.35 nm was obtained; its surface 
morphology is shown in Fig. 2(a). The particle size of

the Miller indices of the crystal plane. It was found that 
the as-prepared In2O3 film had a high transmittance of 
over 85% in the visible light region and a low resistivity 
of approximately 2.35×10–4 Ω·cm, which showed that 
In2O3 was an appropriate buffer layer material for the 
ZnGa2O4 phosphor screen.

ZnGa2O4 is a low-voltage phosphor material for 
the FED, which crystallizes in a spinel structure with a 
bandgap of approximately 4.4 eV and exhibits 
self-activation emission from the Ga luminescence 
center.15-18 The crystallization of ZnGa2O4 phosphor 
deposited on ITO glass is shown in Fig. 1(b), it was 
grown using optimal deposition conditions at a sputtering 
pressure of 5 mTorr and a sputtering power of 100 W. 
(311) was the main growth plane of ZnGa2O4, with a full 
width at half maximum (FWHM) value of approximately 
0.26°. The particle size of ZnGa2O4 was approximately 
8.47 A。. When the ZnGa2O4 phosphor film was deposited 
on In2O3, the preferred crystallization was still in the 
(311) plane, as shown in Fig. 1(c); however, a slight shift 
to high diffraction angles was observed, which was 
owing to smaller grains of ZnGa2O4 were grown on 
In2O3. Further, a narrower (311) peak of approximately 
0.21° was analyzed. The crystallization of ZnGa2O4 
deposited on In2O3 was better than that of one deposited 
on ITO. The lattice mismatch between ZnGa2O4 and 
In2O3 was 16.7%, and between ZnGa2O4 and ITO was 
17.2%. This lower lattice mismatch specified that the 
ZnGa2O4 epilayer on In2O3 had a better crystallization. 
Compare the SEM photographs of Fig. 2(b) with (c), a 
denser surface is found when the ZnGa2O4 was grown on 
In2O3.   
In order to understand the influence of the In2O3 
buffer layer on the luminescence of the ZnGa2O4 
phosphor screen, the surface morphology, resistivity, and 
PL property of the ZnGa2O4/In2O3/ITO glass phosphor 
screen were studied by growing ZnGa2O4 with optimal 
sputtering parameters and varying the deposition 
conditions of In2O3.

conditions.  
 
Figure 3 shows the roughness variation of the 
phosphor surface for different In2O3 deposition 
conditions. It shows that the surface roughness of 
ZnGa2O4 was related to the deposition parameters of 
In2O3; the ZnGa2O4 surface was initially smoothened 
with increasing O2 flow ratio, sputtering pressure, and 
power for In2O3 deposition. A smooth ZnGa2O4 surface 
was obtained when the In2O3 film was deposited under 
160 W, 19 mTorr, and 20% O2 flow ratio. The surface of 
ZnGa2O4 on In2O3 was rough if the In2O3 was grown at 
high values of the O2 flow ratio, sputtering pressure, and 
power. XRD analyses showed that the location of the 
(222) peak of In2O3 was firstly shifted to high diffraction 
angles (reduced particle size) and then moved back to 
low diffraction angles (increased particle size) as the O2 
flow ratio, sputtering power, and pressure increased. The

PL intensity. Thus, for achieving an optimum PL 
intensity for the phosphor screen, the In2O3 buffer layer 
should be prepared under optimal deposition conditions 
with the sputtering pressure at 19 mTorr, power at 160 W, 
and O2 flow ratio at 20%. 
The PL spectra for phosphor screen with and 
without the introduction of an In2O3 buffer layer are 
displayed in Fig. 7. By improving the crystallization, 
surface morphology and resistivity of the ZnGa2O4 
phosphor film with an In2O3 buffer layer prepared, a 
significantly enhanced emission was observed from the 
phosphor screen; the emission exhibited broadband white 
luminescence with the CIE coordinates at x = 0.31 and y 
= 0.38. 
Conclusions 
The In2O3 film with a high transmittance of over 
85% in the visible light region and a low resistivity of 
approximately 2.35×10–4 Ω · cm was prepared. The 
crystallization of ZnGa2O4 deposited on In2O3 was better 
than that of ZnGa2O4 deposited on ITO, owing to the low 
lattice mismatch between ZnGa2O4 and In2O3. The In2O3 
layer showed good crystallization stability for varying 
deposition conditions; hence, the changes in the 
resistivity and crystallization of the phosphor screen with 
respect to the crystalline modification of In2O3 were 
small. However, the surface roughness and resistivity of 
the In2O3 buffer layer influenced the resistivity of the 
phosphor screen. PL analyses revealed that the ligand 
field of the Ga luminescence center was not modified 
when the In2O3 deposition parameters were varied, and it 
was confirmed that enhanced crystallization of phosphor 
led to an enhanced PL intensity. By means of the In2O3 
buffer layer that was prepared to improve the 
crystallization, surface morphology, and resistivity of the 
ZnGa2O4 phosphor film, a significantly enhanced 
emission from the phosphor screen was observed. To 
achieve an optimum PL intensity for the phosphor screen, 
the In2O3 buffer layer should be grown by employing the 
optimal deposition parameters—a sputtering pressure of 
19 mTorr, power of 160 W and O2 flow ratio of 20%.
