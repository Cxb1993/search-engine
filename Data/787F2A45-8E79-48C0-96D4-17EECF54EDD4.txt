is thus restricted by the composition of the material. In addition, due to the highly 
reactive nature of Ti, it is also very difficult to prepare Ti-based bulk metallic glasses  
by conventional mold casting methods. Therefore, the thickness of Ti-based BMGs is 
only several millimeters, much smaller than those of other BMG systems [20]. 
Recently, many studies indicated that metallic glass powders with supercooled 
liquid region have been formed by mechanical alloying technique. Mechanical 
alloying can be considered as a special form of solid-state reaction and can lead to 
amorphization in a wide alloy composition rage. Therefore, The fabrication of 
Ti-based bulk metallic glass samples through the powder metallurgy route by 
consolidating the mechanically alloyed glassy powders inside supercooled liquid 
region with vacuum hot press is possible. For instance, Zhang et al [21]. have 
reported that ball-milled Ti50Cu18Ni22Al4Sn6 amorphous powders can be consolidated 
into bulk metallic glass by the equal channel angular extrusion technique.Until now, 
many researchers have investigated the glass-forming ability, thermal stability, and 
mechanical properties of all the casted Ti-based BMG . Unfortunately, the mechanical 
properties and corrosion behavior data for Ti-based BMG prepared by powder 
metallurgy method have been scarce. The application of Ti-based BMG requires a 
stable material system in a variety of different operating environments. Consequently, 
it is important to investigate the mechanical properties as well as corrosion behavior 
of Ti-based metallic glasses in many aggressive environments. In the present work, 
we report the formation and mechanical properties of Ti-based BMG prepared by 
powder metallurgy route. In addition, the corrosion behavior of the glassy 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 in NaCl, HCl, H2SO4 and NaOH solutions at room temperature is also 
studied and the origin of the corrosion resistance is discussed. 
elsewhere[22]. Mechanical properties of the BMG disc were evaluated by the Vickers 
microhardness tests and compression tests. Before the mechanical tests, the relative density of 
the BMG disc was measured by the Archimedean method. The Vickers microhardness of 
consolidated BMG samples was measured with a Matsuzawa MXT50-UL machine using a 
static load of 500 g. The compression test was performed by a universal test machine (Instron 
4050) with a strain rate of 1 x 10-4 s-1. The sample was prepared by the arc discharge method 
to a size of 3 mm (length) x 2 mm (width) x 2 mm (height).  
The corrosion characteristics of the alloys were determined on the basis of anodic 
polarization curves obtained by the potentiodynamic method. Prior to the corrosion test, the 
specimens were mechanically polished in cyclohexane with silicon carbide paper at a 
maximum grit of 2000, degreased in acetone, washed with distilled water, dried in air, and 
further exposed to air for 24h for good reproducibility. The potentiodynamic polarization test 
was conducted using the three-electrode principle with a Solartron model 1286A potentiostat, 
which used platinum as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the 
reference electrode. The samples were tested in 1N H2SO4, HNO3, NaOH, and 3 wt% NaCl 
solutions at room temperature. The anodic polarization curves were measured at a potential 
sweep rate of 1mV/s after open-circuit immersion for about 30 min, by which the open circuit 
potential had become almost steady. The morphologies of the corroded surfaces of the BMG 
samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray 
(EDX) microanalysis in a Hitachi S-4800. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
measurements for surface analysis of the specimens, before and after the electrochemical 
tests in the solutions, were performed using a VG ESCA Scientific Theta Probe photoelectron 
spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Ka excitation (hν= 1486.6 eV).
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders as a function of milling time. At the early stage of milling, say 1h, 
crystalline Ti, Cu, Ni, and Sn peaks were observed. The peak intensities decreased with 
increasing milling time. Not only the diffraction peaks of Ni, and Sn became 
undistinguishable, but Ti and Cu peaks’ intensities decreased significantly after 2h of milling. 
An amorphous-representing broad diffraction peak was superimposed on the Ti and Cu major 
diffraction peaks at around 2θ = 42o after 3h of milling treatment. This observation suggests 
that the 3h ball-milled powders were mixtures of Ti and Cu solid solutions and amorphous 
phases. Crystalline peaks of Ti and Cu solid solutions diminished progressively with the 
increasing milling time. Only a broad diffraction peak exhibited and fully amorphous 
powders formed at the end of milling (7h). 
The gradual decrease of the elemental X-ray peaks during the early milling stages is 
similar to what is observed during the amorphization by mechanical alloying in many 
binary[23~25] or multi-element[26~27] systems. Weeber and Bakker[28] reported three 
different types of amorphization reactions by MA of binary elemental powder mixture (AxBy). 
Type I denotes that the “effective crystalline size” continuously decreases and the peak 
positions shift, ultimately resulting in an amorphous alloy; i.e., the solid solution is an 
intermediate stage. The second type directly forms an amorphous alloy from the starting 
elemental powders; i.e., the diffraction peak intensities of the elements decrease and a broad 
peak’s intensity of the amorphous alloy increase. For the final type, intermetallics form as 
intermediate products and further milling results in an amorphous alloy. In the current study, 
as revealed by Fig. 2, an amorphous-representing broad diffraction peak was superimposed 
on the Ti and Cu crystalline peaks after 3h of milling. This suggests that type I amorphization 
reaction may be responsible for the formation of bulk amorphous Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders. 
Conventional x-ray diffraction technique examined the long-range order of the as-milled 
powders, while synchrotron EXAFS technique revealed the local atomic variations during 
MA. Figure 3a shows the EXAFS spectra of Cu K edge (i.e., 8979 eV) of the as-milled 
Milling of Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx alloys 
Amorphous Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx (x=0~7) powders can be prepared after 7h of milling, Fig. 
5. Though not reported in current study, the X-ray diffraction, SEM observation, and DSC 
scans of Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx as-milled powders show a similar trend to those of Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 
as described above. 
Figure 6 shows the DSC curves of the amorphous Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx alloy powders. It 
can be noted that, without any tin addition, Ti50Cu35Ni15 exhibited no glass transition behavior. 
The amorphous Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx (x=3~7) alloy powders, however, exhibited an endothermic 
glass transition event followed by a sharp exothermic peak. As shown in Figure 6, the 
amorphous alloys exhibit a wide supercooled liquid region of 58, 59, and 61K for 
Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx where x is equal to 3, 5, and 7 respectively. The supercooled regions are 
similar to those reported in the literatures [8, 33].  
The simultaneous presence of several elements was found to cause a significant 
extension of the supercooled liquid region before crystallization. Inoue et al [34] suggested 
that large atomic size ratios, attractive bonding nature between the constituent elements, and 
the difficulty of redistributing these elements for crystallization are dominant factors for the 
increase in glass-forming ability and the appearance of a wide supercooled liquid region. For 
the Ti-Cu-Ni-Sn system investigated in the current study, the atomic radii of Ti, Cu, Ni, and 
Sn are 0.145, 0.128, 0.125, and 0.151 nm respectively. The increasing differences in atomic 
size due to Sn additions may lead to a highly random dense packed structure in the 
amorphous phases that induce a large liquid/solid interfacial energy and make the 
redistribution of atoms on a large scale difficult. The above-mentioned characteristics of the 
alloys suppress the nucleation and growth of crystalline phases in the supercooled liquid 
phase, and thus lead to improved glass forming ability and high thermal stability in the 
amorphous mechanically alloyed Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx powders. 
Kim et al [33] have reported that the Ti-Cu-Ni-Sn amorphous alloys can be prepared by 
glass transition and crystallization temperatures, i.e., Tg and Tx, can be defined as the onset 
temperatures of the endothermic and exothermic DSC events, respectively. The temperature 
difference between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tx) 
is denoted as the supercooled liquid region (ΔT; ΔT = Tx-Tg). After consolidating amorphous 
powders into the BMG disc, not only an increase in Tg but a decrease in Tx can be noticed. 
The supercooled liquid region of the BMG disc was, therefore, smaller than that of its starting 
amorphous powders. As shown in Figure 10, the amorphous Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 as-milled 
powders and the BMG disc exhibited a wide supercooled liquid region of 61K and 43K, 
respectively. 
In addition to the variation in Tg, Tx, and ΔT, it is also noted that the relative amount of 
amorphous-to-crystalline transformation decreased after consolidation. The crystallization 
enthalpy (ΔH) of the as-milled amorphous powders and the BMG disc was 59.3 and 36.1 J/g, 
respectively. This indicates that the amorphous phase within BMG disc is ~61%, compared to 
that of its starting amorphous powders. This phenomenon implies that vacuum hot pressing 
amorphous powders induce partial crystallization that is similar to that suggested by the XRD 
results (Fig. 8). 
Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the amorphization status and 
the nanocrystallization within its corresponding BMG disc. The TEM image of amorphous 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders was shown in Fig. 10, where a typical “salt and pepper” 
microstructure representing a homogeneous amorphous phase can be noticed. Though not 
shown here, limited nanocrystals with a size range from 2 to 5 nm can be observed within the 
amorphous matrix. The nanocrystals are ambiguous and without a distinct boundary, due to 
the relatively large strain induced by the milling process. These ambiguous nanocrystals, 
however, may serve as nucleation sites during the vacuum hot pressing treatment. Figures 
11(a) and 11(b) show, respectively, the bright field and dark field TEM images of 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG disc. It can be noted that nanocrystals with a size range from 5 to 25 
be noticed. The Young’s modulus (obtained from the slope of the stress-strain curve), fracture 
stress, and corresponding elastic strain are 79 GPa, 1830 MPa, and 2.48 %, respectively. The 
Young’s modulus (79 GPa) was lower than previously reported in the literature (~90-110 GPa 
by suction casting [8] and 93 GPa by equal channel angular extrusion [21] ). In addition, the 
fracture stress (1830 MPa) is slightly lower than that estimated by the microhardness (i.e., 
Hv/3 = 2071 MPa). The residual porosity due to the particle boundaries (as shown in Fig. 7(b)) 
can be attributed to the relatively low Young’s modulus and fracture stress. As shown in Fig. 
7(c) for the trace of indentation, more particle boundaries or microcracks were revealed under 
applied load (500 grams). The porosity, pre-existing particle boundaries, and interfaces 
between nanocrystals and the amorphous matrix may serve as the crack nucleation sites that 
propagate and grow rapidly. Thus, brittle failure occurs before reaching the elastic limit and 
no plastic deformation is noticed.  
The fracture stress of Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG (1830 MPa), however, is much larger than 
that of Ti50Cu18Ni22Al4Sn6 BMG prepared by equal-channel angularly extruding ball-milled 
powders [21]. In addition, the corresponding elastic strain (2.48 %) is also higher than that 
(1.1%) of the ECAE-BMG sample. Not to mention the different compositions of BMGs, not 
only the Ti-based BMGs, were prepared by different processing techniques but different 
sample sizes were used for the compression test. It is difficult to make a comprehensive 
comparison. However, it should be pointed out that the BMG sample prepared by powder 
metallurgical routes suffers from the pre-existing crack initiation sites that can propagate and 
grow rapidly. This failure mechanism differs from the local shear bands of suction-casted 
BMGs [17].  
Corrosion Behavior of Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG  
The polarization curves for Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG are shown in Fig. 13. Some 
important data derived from the curves, including the corrosion potential (Ec), corrosion 
current density(ic), passive potential (Ep), and passive current density (ip), are summarized in 
observed for the specimens in this solutions and was assigned to Cl- ions on the surface film. 
The peaks of Ti2p were composed of peaks corresponding to species in the oxide state on the 
surface film. Similar cases occurred in Ti-Zr-Pd-Cu-Sn [41] and Ni-Nb-Ti-Zr [42] BMGs. 
Zhang [43] believes that it is the joint effect of Ti and Zr and more specifically, the 
synergetic effect of the two elements that inhibits corrosion and improves the 
anti-electrochemical degradation characteristics for all of the alloys that contain Ti and Zr 
elements. The fact that Zr- and Ti-oxides are more stable chemically and are structurally 
denser than Cu-oxide should account for the enhancement of the corrosion resistance of the 
BMG [44]. On the other hand, this may be related to the difference in the ionizing energy of 
the out-shell electrons in the atoms of constituent elements. The lower the ionizing energy of 
the out-shell electrons, the more chemically active the atom. Zr and Ti atoms have a lower 
ionizing energy (6.84 and 6.82 eV, respectively) as compared with Cu (7.72eV) [44]. This 
would cause a faster formation of a passive film in case of the existence of Zr and Ti, and 
subsequently results in an improvement of corrosion resistance and a decrease in the 
corrosion rate in this BMG system.  
In fact, stable passivation did not occur in NaOH and NaCl solutions for the 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG alloys, most particularly in the Cl--containing solution. It can be seen 
from Fig. 5 that deep corrosion pits are an observable characteristic of the active nature of the 
Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG alloy in NaCl solution after polarization tests. They can be explained 
by the galvanic corrosion caused by the combination of a noble element, such as Cu (+0.35V), 
and a base element, such as Zr (-1.53V) or Ti (-1.63V), for Cu-Zr or Cu-Ti alloys. Because of 
compositional heterogeneities between Cu and Zr or Cu and Ti in the glassy matrix, this 
would favor the nucleation of pits [45] and accelerate the pit formation.  The enhanced local 
selective dissolution of active metals (Zr and Ti) will take place at some weak sites with 
physical or chemical defects, as a result of the auto-catalytic reaction with chloride ions. 
Continuous corrosion of local sites can also lead to dissolution of elemental Cu, but this 
Conclusions 
We have studied the amorphization behavior of Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx (x=0~7) alloy 
powders synthesized by mechanical alloying technique. The as-milled powders were 
amorphous at compositions of Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx (x=0~7) after 7 hours of milling. The 
thermal stability of these Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx amorphous powders was investigated by 
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The amorphous Ti50Cu35Ni15 powders without tin 
addition exhibit no glass transition behavior. While a wide supercooled region can be noticed 
for amorphous Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx powders with tin additions ranged from 3 to 7 atomic 
percent. The wide supercooled liquid region (i.e., ΔT) is 58, 59, and 61K for 
Ti50Cu35-xNi15Snx where x is equal to 3, 5, and 7 respectively. 
Using the vacuum hot-pressing technique, the as-milled Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders were 
consolidated onto a disc compact with a diameter and thickness of 10 and 3 mm at 723K for 
30 minutes under a pressure of 1.20 GPa. The Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 bulk metallic glass disc 
consisting of a mixture of an amorphous matrix and nanosrystals. The microstructure of the 
bulk metallic glass showed that nanocrystals with a size ranged from 5 to 25 nm are 
distributed randomly within the amorphous matrix. Partial crystallization occurred during 
vacuum hot pressing and the relative density of BMG was 94.3%. The supercooled liquid 
region was 43 K for BMG and smaller than that of amorphous Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 powders (61 
K). Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG exhibited Vickers microhardness and a fracture stress of 634 
kg/mm2 and 1830 MPa, respectively. The fracture stress was smaller than the estimated value 
obtained by one third of the microhardness. The pre-existing microcracks or defects, 
including porosity, pre-existing particle boundaries and/or interfaces between nanocrystals 
and the amorphous matrix, may serve as the crack initiation sites that propagate and grow 
rapidly. Under the compression test, Ti50Cu28Ni15Sn7 BMG exhibited brittle failure and an 
elastic strain of 2.48%. The electrochemical behavior and surface composition analysis of
