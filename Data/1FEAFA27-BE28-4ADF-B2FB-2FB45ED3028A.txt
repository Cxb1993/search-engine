 for the impurity, and 25℃ and 35℃ for the two temperature levels. First, 
in the absence of the magnetic field, the aragonite growth rate data will be collected at 
the two temperatures and at various concentrations of each impurity. Then, the growth 
experiment will be repeated under the same operation conditions, but in the presence 
of a magnetic field. Meanwhile, the microstructure of the seed crystals will be 
examined for the cases of different growth environments in order to explain the 
effects of the three factors. 
 
 
3. 文獻探討 
Scale prevention using a magnetic water treatment device (MWTD) in the 
cooling water system has been a controversial issue for a long time because effective 
and ineffective cases have been reported. The situation is similar to that judged from 
the results of lab-scale studies on the nucleation and crystal growth of calcite, which 
is the major component of scale (Baker and Judd, 1996). In order to explore the 
mechanism of the magnetic effect, the nucleation and growth behaviors of calcite and 
aragonite, i.e., the most common polymorphs of CaCO3, have been studied in our 
laboratory using the constant-composition method, which is the most suitable 
technique for controlling the pH and solution composition and for studying the 
crystallization of sparingly-soluble salts, such as calcium carbonate (Parsiegla and 
Katz, 1999; Tai et al., 2006a) and calcium fluoride (Tai et al., 2006b; Tai and Chen, 
2011). To investigate the magnetic effect on the crystal growth of the CaCO3 
polymorphs, the experimental work started by measuring the crystal growth rate of 
calcite at 25℃in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field (Tai et al., 2008), 
then the seed crystals were replaced by aragonite. In addition, nucleation of CaCO3 
was investigated in the same apparatus (Chang and Tai, 2010). From the experimental 
facts on nucleation and crystal growth, a mechanism was proposed to explain the 
effect of a magnetic field (Chang and Tai, 2010). The growth experiments of calcite 
were further conducted in a simulated cooling-water environment, i.e., at higher 
temperature and in the presence of impurity (Tai et al., 2011b). Then, the MWTD was 
incorporated into the growth system to observe its effect on the growth of calcite 
seeds (Liu et al., 2011).                    
   The first work published in our laboratory on investigating the magnetic effect 
dealt with the growth behavior of calcite (Tai et al., 2008). In the absence of a 
magnetic field, the growth rate of calcite seeds was measured at 25℃ and within the 
metastable region in the order of 10
-11
 to 10
-10 
m/s. When the supersaturated solution 
was magnetized with an MWTD, the growth rate was reduced by an order of 
magnitude; it even stopped growing at lower supersaturations. The growth experiment 
 4
and Sr
2+
, were chosen from the two groups, based on the atomic radius being smaller 
and larger than that of Ca
2+
, respectively, for a further study of impurity in our 
laboratory (Tai et al., 2011b) The former, which favors the formation of aragonite 
(Sohnel and Mullin, 1982), reduced the calcite growth rate in accordance with the 
result reported by Herzog et al. (1989), while the Sr
2+
, which favors the formation of 
calcite (Sohnel and Mullin, 1982 ), accelerated the calcite growth rate. Tai et al. 
(2011b) postulated that the adsorption of different impurity species on the crystal 
surface brings forth the adverse effect. Then, the impurity effect was investigated in 
the presence of the magnetic field (Liu et al., 2011). The calcite did not grow without 
adding an impurity. When a small amount of either impurity, i.e, 0.5ppm, was added 
to the solution, the calcite growth rate jumped to a significant value. Then, the growth 
rate decreased and increased with a further increase in the Fe
2+
 and Sr
2+
 concentration, 
respectively. Liu et al., (2011) used the cluster transformation mechanism again to 
explain the sudden jump of the growth rate at the impurity concentration of 0.5ppm. 
In the absence of impurity, all of the calcite-like clusters existing in the solution had 
transformed to aragonite-like clusters after magnetization, resulting in no growth of 
calcite; however, the presence of either impurity would cause the two types of clusters 
to be in equilibrium. Therefore, the growth rates were measurable even at the low 
concentration of 0.5ppm. As for the adverse effect of the two impurities at higher 
concentrations, Liu et al. (2011) postulated that the adsorption of different impurity 
species on the crystal surface brought forth the difference. For the case of Fe
2+
, the 
adsorption of more FeCO3 at higher impurity concentrations blocked more growth 
sites, thereby reducing the growth rate. On the other hand, the adsorption of more Sr
2+
, 
which favors the formation of calcite at a higher impurity concentration, caused more 
nuclei to form on the seed surface, thus accelerating the growth rate. In addition, the 
equilibrium constant between the two types of clusters in the presence of an impurity 
might be a function of the impurity concentration and may cause the difference in the 
growth rate. 
 
 
4. 研究方法 
4.1. Preparation of aragonite seed crystals. 
The procedure of preparing aragonite seeds was the same as that reported by 
Chang and Tai (2010). Here, we will briefly describe the curing step, which is crucial 
for the reproducibility of the growth rate data. A chunk of natural aragonite from 
Morocco was crushed and ground into small particles, then sieved to give a sample 
with an average size of 774µm using 16 and 24 mesh sieves. The sieved seeds were 
rinsed with ethyl alcohol and deionized water before being stored in a sealed bottle.

field. In this case, the circulating loop of the crystallizer was removed and the 
premagnetization step was skipped. The other steps of the experimental procedure 
were essentially the same as those in the presence of the magnetic field.  
 
4.3. Correction of temperature-related constants. 
The equation for estimating the relative supersaturation, σ, is the same as that 
used by Liu et al. (2011) in the study of calcite: 
                    (2) 
The solubility product, Ksp, of aragonite is different from that of calcite. It can be 
expressed as a function of temperature (Plummer and Busonburg, 1982):  
    (3) 
where T is in Kelvin. On the other hand, the activity coefficient, γ, varies little with 
temperature in the range studied, i.e., between 25℃ and 40℃, according to the Davies 
equation (Tai et al., 2011a). The calculated values of 0.588 and 0.580 were used for 
25℃ and 40℃, respectively. In addition, the constants in the mass-action equation 
should be corrected for temperature as well (Lowell et al., 1970). They are not 
presented here because there are too many to list. 
 
 
5. 結果與討論 
5.1. Surface structure of aragonite seed. 
The photographs of aragonite seed at different stages of the experiment are shown in 
Figure 2, in which Figure 2(a) is a chunk of natural aragonite used as the starting 
material, Figure 2(b) is the surface of the ground aragonite, Figure 2(c) is the surface 
of the seeds after curing, and Figure 2 (d) is the seed surface after growth. The surface 
of the ground natural aragonite is rather flat, with some crystal dust adhering to it, as 
shown in Figure 2 (b). After the curing process, as shown in Figure 2(c), the surface 
of the aragonite seeds was covered with acicular particles of micron size, which is the 
most common form of aragonite. After the growth process, the acicular particles grew 
larger, as shown in Figure 2(d). Thus, the linear growth rate measured in this 
experiment is the increment of solute volume deposited on the acicular crystals 
divided by the surface area of the uncured crystals.  
    To ensure the structure of seed crystal, the ground particles were analyzed by an 
X-ray diffractometer, as shown in Figure 3, together with the JCPDS card of aragonite. 
The peaks appearing in Figure 3(a) and (b) match each other.   
 
 8
crystals on the seed surface still kept the same shape as that before growth. This 
means that the crystal structure did not change in the pressure of Fe
2+
. Nevertheless, 
the numerical density is higher at the higher temperature (Figure 5(a) vs. Figure 5(b)) 
under the same concentration [Fe
2+
] of 0.5ppm, and the crystals are larger at higher 
Fe
2+
 concentration (Figure 5(b) vs. Figure 5(c)). The two cases yielded higher growth 
rates, as shown in Figure 4. 
The reason for the growth of aragonite seeds at 35℃ but not at 25℃ has been 
explained using the hypothesis of cluster transformation (Tai et al., 2011a). The ratio 
of the two types of clusters existing in the supersaturated solution was dependent 
upon the temperature. At 25℃, calcite-like clusters formed and would not incorporate 
into the aragonite seeds. At 35℃, some clusters transformed into the aragonite-like 
clusters and the two types of clusters were at equilibrium, thus the aragonite seeds 
would grow. In addition, the jump in the growth rate to a significant value as the Fe
2+
 
concentration increased from 0 to 0.1ppm must be also related to the change in 
driving force, i.e., the transformation of calcite-like clusters into aragonite-like 
clusters. Nevertheless, the actual working mechanism of Fe
2+
 is unknown. Sohnel and 
Mullin (1982) reported that Fe
2+
, which has a radius smaller than Ca
2+
 and has higher 
hydration energy, favored aragonite formation. No matter what causes the formation 
of aragonite clusters, the effects of Fe
2+
 on the nucleation and growth of aragonite are 
consistent. As to the larger difference in the growth rate between the two temperatures 
at the higher concentration, the interaction between the temperature and Fe
2+
 remains 
unclear due to a lack of understanding of the Fe
2+
 effect.        
 
5.4. Impurity effects of Fe
2+
 with magnetization at two temperatures. 
With the magnetic device incorporated into the growth system, the aragonite 
rates were also measured at the Fe
2+
 concentration ranging between 0 and 2ppm and 
at the two temperatures of 25℃ and 35℃. The measured growth rates are shown in 
Fig. 6, in which the aragonite growth rates measured in the absence of magnetic field 
are also presented for comparison. Without adding Fe
2+
 to the solution, i.e., [Fe
2+
] = 
0ppm, the growth rate of aragonite was significant at either 25℃ or 35℃. When Fe2+ 
was present, the growth rates decreased with an increase in the Fe
2+ 
concentration for 
both temperatures and were faster at the higher temperature. Nevertheless, the 
difference in the growth rate between two temperatures at [Fe
2+
] = 0ppm was quite 
small as compared with other Fe
2+
 concentrations. This implies that there is an 
interaction between temperature and Fe
2+
 on the aragonite growth. When we compare 
the growth rates with and without magnetization, it is surprising to see that Fe
2+ 
has an 
adverse effect on the aragonite growth for both temperatures i.e., the growth rate 
decreased with an increase in [Fe
2+
] with magnetization and increased with an

5.6. Impurity effects of Sr
2+
 with magnetization at two temperatures. 
The aragonite growth rates in the presence of Sr
2+ 
impurity at 25℃ and 35℃ 
under the influence of a magnetic field are plotted in Figure 10. In the presence of a 
magnetic field, the growth rates decreased with an increase in Sr
2+
 concentration for 
both temperatures, and the growth rates at 25℃ were higher than those at 35℃, 
except at 0ppm of Sr
2+
. The SEM microphotographs of different magnifications for 
the seed surfaces under different growth environments are presented in Figures 11, 
including the case of 2.0ppm Sr
2+ 
at 25℃ and 35℃. Figure 11(a)-(c) are photographs 
of 25℃ with increasing magnification. The crystals on the surface looked more like 
calcite of rhombohedral form. The photographs for the case of 35℃ are shown in 
Figures 11(d)-(f), in which (e) and (f) are the enlarged photos of (d). In Figure 11(f), 
some needle-like aragonite can be seen. We may conclude that the surface of the seed 
became complicated under the influence of Sr
2+
 and magnetic field simultaneously 
and that the growth rate measured became meaningless. 
 
 
6. 結論及建議 
With or without magnetization, the growth rates of aragonite seeds have been 
measured in a stirred-tank crystallizer by varying the following variables: impurity 
concentration of Fe
2+
 and Sr
2+ 
between 0-2.0ppm and temperature at 25℃ or 35℃. In 
the presence and absence of Fe
2+
, the needle aragonite adhered to the seed surface 
preserved after growth, so that the growth behavior of the aragonite seed was 
predictable. The aragonite seed did not grow at 25℃ in the absence of the impurity 
and magnetic field, but did grow at 35℃ in a similar environment. The cluster 
transformation mechanism was able to explain the growth behavior. As far as the 
impurity effect was concerned, the growth rate increased with the Fe
2+
 concentration 
for both temperatures, but tended to level off for the case of 25℃. This was probably 
due to the saturation of Fe
2+
 adsorption at higher concentrations. The mechanism of 
Fe
2+
 effect on the aragonite growth is uncertain; nevertheless, the effect is in 
accordance with the formation of aragonite. In addition, the growth rates were higher 
for the case of 35℃, consistent with the general trend of most systems reported in the 
literature, and the synergetic effect of temperature and Fe
2+ 
on the aragonite growth 
was tremendous. When the supersaturated solution was magnetized, significant values 
of growth rates were measured in the absence of Fe
2+
 due to the transformation of 
clusters induced by the magnetic field and the growth rate decreased with an increase 
in Fe
2+
 concentration because of the increase in equilibrium constant in favor of 
calcite clusters. This trend was the opposite of the case without magnetization. The 
magnetic field and Fe
2+
 favored the aragonite growth individually, thus it is surprising
