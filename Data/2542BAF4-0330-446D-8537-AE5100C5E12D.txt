一、前言 
    近年來由於微機電系統技術的開發與
成熟，利用微流體技術進行生物醫學方面
的研究已是時代的潮流。而一些微流系統
元件也依序地被開發出來，其元件包含微
幫浦、微感測器、微流道、微閥等。而其
中又以微幫浦在微流系統中占的比重較
高，其原因在於微幫浦是整個微流系統的
動力來源，負責驅動微流系統的工作流
體，由此可見微幫浦的重要性，微流體技
術之關鍵元件即為微幫浦如圖 1，除此之外
根據微流體特性而開發出來的相關元件包
含微流道、微反應器、微閥門、微幫浦、
微混合器及微分離器等。其中微幫浦除用
來驅動傳輸及定量化微流體外，亦是控制
化學反應時序的關鍵元件[1]，第一類為非
機械式微幫浦，其包含電液動式、彈性平
面波式、電滲流式、連續電濕潤式、磁液
動式及氣泡式等。第二類為機械式微幫
浦，為最常見的機械式微幫浦架構，包含
微致動器、薄膜、腔體及微閥門等結構，
分別提供薄膜變形力、彈性回復力、流體
通道與儲存及控制流體朝特定方向流動等
功能。在操作上是利用微致動器驅動薄膜
變形後產生抽吸壓力，此時流體通過進口
端閥門而進入腔體，隨後微致動器驅動薄
膜往反方向變形造成推進壓力，而使得腔
體內的流體通過出口端閥門輸出。

四、結論 
    微細系統的動態特性與微細系統的作

實際操作微流體技術控制中，往往因微型
幫浦的穩定或動態特性不佳而導致流體流
動性誤差大，使得流體傳輸行為及反應程

所以微型幫浦的動態特性分析是有其必要
性。 
    本計劃是先以理論分析此微型幫浦之
動態特性，以下是對於本文所做的分析做

3. 系統在反相正模時，上方樑與下方樑，

Abstract—For smaller mechatronic device, especially for micro 
Electronic system, a micro machining is a must. However, most 
investigations on vibration of a mill have been limited to the 
traditional type mill. In this article, vibration and dynamic 
characteristics of a micro mill were investigated in this study. The 
trend towards higher precision manufacturing technology requires 
producing miniaturized components. To improve micro-milled 
product quality, obtain a higher production rate and avoid milling 
breakage, the dynamic characteristics of micro milling must be studied. 
A stepped pre-twisted mill is used to simulate the micro mill. The 
finite element analysis is employed in this work. The flute length and 
diameter effects of the micro mill are considered. It is clear that the 
effects of micro mill shape parameters on vibration in a micro mill are 
significant. 
Keywords—micro system, micro mill, vibration. 
I. INTRODUCTION
HE milling is frequently employed in manufacturing to 
produce many goods. A precisely milling leads to a high 
quality product and its accuracy is based upon the milling 
process. During this process, cutting location errors, reaming 
and mill fracture occur. The trend towards higher precious 
manufacturing technology requires more micro machining, 
such as micro milling. To improve quality, produce a higher 
production rate and avoiding micro mill breakage, the cutting 
force and dynamic characteristics of a micro milling must be 
studied. In this work, the effects of rotation speed, feed velocity 
and cutting depth on vibration were considered and the cutting 
critical force was also investigated. Recently, some 
investigations as [1-3] turned attention to these micro milling 
problems. However, most studies are focused on the cutting 
chip, force operation or prediction. Few investigations 
examined the micro mill dynamic characteristics, even though 
the dynamic properties may change the machining performance 
significantly. This study considers the micro mill dynamic 
characteristics. 
Most traditional end milling analysis focused on the cutting 
force and chip deformation, such as [4, 5]. Few studies focused 
the dynamic mill properties as in [6], which examined the

complex geometry of cutting bits. Some investigations, such as 
[7] reported that the helical flute structure may affect the 
dynamic characteristics of a mill. The helical flute structure and 
complex cutting bits are often found in a mill. Some studies [8, 
9] reported on the vibrations in a pre-twisted beam, modeled as 
a drill or end mill. The effects of the pre-twisted angle and 
rotation speed on vibrations in the beam were presented. The 
effects of complex geometry or the cutting chip on dynamic 
mill bit properties were also examined. Even a small variation 
in the geometry or symmetry could produce a very strong 
influence on the cutting and dynamic properties of a cutting 
system, such as [10]. Such models can provide useful 
information for mill bit design 
In nearly all cases, micro machining is widely used to cut 
miniaturized components in the electronic, aerospace and 
biomedical industries. The micro machining problem has 
recently attracted many researchers [11, 12]. However, few 
investigations examined the dynamic properties or vibration of 
complex stepped structures in micro end mills. Complex 
stepped micro mill sections with helical flute structure are 
considered in this article. A stepped pre-twisted mill was used 
to simulate the micro mill structure. Using the finite element 
analysis to solve the micro mill natural frequency problem is 
considered. 
II.FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS
Figure 1 and 2 show photographic and enlarged views of a 
micro end mill. This micro mill was simulated as a stepped 
pre-twisted mill. This mill is a cantilever stepped pre-twisted 
beam with a constant rotation speed of  :  as shown in Fig. 3. 
The total mill length is L. Notations 
1L  and D were employed 
to denote the length and diameter of the mill shank. A 
pre-twisted beam was used to simulate the micro mill body.  
and t b  were used to denote the thickness and breadth of the 
mill body.

For a high precision micro machining, the vibration 
amplitude of cutting tool may change the cutting quality, even 
for a little residual vibration. The residual vibration effect is 
considered in this article. Figure 8 shows the residual vibration 
amplitude in a micro mill with different diameter. Generally, a 
larger diameter of a micro mill may have stronger stiffness, so 
the excited vibration is lower. By another word, the residual 
vibration will be decreased as the diameter of a micro mill is 
increased. The residual vibration amplitude in a micro mill with 
different cutting flute length is shown in Fig. 9. As the Fig. 6, 
the natural frequency will be depressed as the cutting flute 
length is increased. It is found that the mill stiffness is 
dependent on the flute length. In this Fig. 9, however, the result 
also displays that the residual vibration amplitude is depressed 
if the cutting flute length is decreased. The tapered shank length 
of a micro mill effect is also considered. Fig. 10 shows the 
residual vibration amplitude in a micro mill with different 
tapered shank length. Results indicate that the residual 
vibration amplitude will be depressed if the tapered shank 
length is decreased.  
In actual engineering, the lower mode natural frequencies 
affect the dynamic characteristics of system more than the 
higher mode. Hence, only the lower four modes are displayed 
in this article. The large displacement occurs only on the micro 
mill helical flute. This phenomenon agrees with the micro mill 
in actual milling process.  The dynamic characteristic of a 
micro stepped mill is different from the traditional mill. Figure 
11 illustrates the frequency response in a micro mill with 
different mill diameter. At lower mode, the 1st natural 
frequencies are almost identical even though they have 
different diameter. However, at higher mode, the natural 
frequency may shift a higher domain frequency as the micro 
mill has a smaller diameter flute. The frequency response in a 
micro mill with different mill diameter is shown in Fig. 12. The 
longer cutting flute length of a micro mill with weaker stiffness 
in unavoidable. Hence, in this figure, the natural frequencies 
including the lower and higher mode are depressed if the 
cutting flute length is increased. To proceed farther into the 
tapered shank length effect on the frequency response, the 
variations in frequency response with different tapered shank 
lengths is shown in Fig. 13. Results indicate the natural 
frequency peaks shifted the lower frequency domain if the 
tapered shank length is increased

Abstract：The dynamic properties of tubes are frequently affected by the existence of local flaw. These tubes are worn 
from the fluid shock waves. The variation of the dynamic characteristics of a multi-tubes system in cross-flow is 
investigated in this work. Periodically coupled water tubes are used to approximate a multi-tubes system. Each tube is 
considered to be coupled to adjacent tubes through the squeezed water film in the gaps. For simplicity, the tubes are 
approximated as Euler-Bernoulli beams with round and hollow cross sections. The fluid stiffness model is employed to 
couple the fluid filled tubes. The Galerkin’s method was used to derive the discrete modal equation for this periodic 
system. A dynamic model of the coupled tube bundle is proposed. The numerical results reveal that the fluid flow defect 
may affect dynamic properties in a periodically coupled tubes system significantly. The effects of fluid flow velocity, fluid 
density and tube thickness on dynamic properties of a tube system are considered. 
Key words：tube system; natural property; fluid flow 
 
 
1  INTRODUCTION 
 
An investigation on the effect of fluid flow on 
natural properties in multi-tubes system is considered 
in this work. The multi-tubes system is employed to 
simulate the heat exchangers system. These heat 
exchangers are employed to provide cooling water for 
principal component systems in a nuclear power plant. 
The heat exchanger system is the main safety facility 
for the prevention of nuclear accidents. Unfortunately, 
abrasions often appear near the center of tube due to 
impact friction and wear during operation. Hence, a 
study on natural properties in a heat exchangers 
system is necessary. Structural defected in the tubes 
can be observed after the system is operated under 
severe conditions[1-3]. This local structural defected 
caused by the fluid flow in the multi-tubes system. 
This fluid flow effect may also markedly alter the 
dynamic behavior of a periodically arranged tube 
system. Therefore, the fluid flow effect on natural 
properties of a heat exchanger is considered in this 
work. 
Most studies on heat exchangers focused on the 
heat or flow therein[4, 5]. Some papers as[6-9] studied the 
dynamic behavior of such heat exchanger systems. 
However, no investigation on mode localization in a 
heat exchanger with cross-flow has been reported yet. 
As noted in papers[10-14], focusing only on the tube 
structure is insufficient in addressing the structural 
failure mode potential. The effects of cross-flow fluid 
and the localization effect introduced from local 
defects on the dynamics of heat exchanger tubes must 
also be examined. References[10-14] have addressed the 
fluid effects on the dynamic behaviors of heat 
exchanger tube systems. The fluid in and around tubes 
has been observed to significantly affect the dynamic

,  ,  ,  jk jk jk jkα σ τ β′ ′ ′ ′  are the added fluid-stiffness

The fluid flow direction is in the u direction. Therefore, 
the effect of transverse displacements components vk on 
the exciting force components gj and hj are so small that 
can be neglected in the analysis. Only the u displacement 
components are considered, the Eqs 2(a) and 2(b) can be 
simplified as

Due to the flow fluid introduced force, the jth tube would 
be excited by the force with components gj and hj from 
surround tubes. Consider all the tubes are vibrated 
harmonically with a frequency i.e. cosk ku u tω=  .

Figure 6 presents the fluid density effect on the 
natural frequencies of the heat exchanger system with 
an average flow velocity of U=0.05 m/sec. In this 
figure, fluid density effect can affect the natural 
frequency of a heat exchanger with fluid flow velocity. 
It is found that the natural frequency of the system 
decreases as the fluid density is increased. Fluid 
density effect on vibration is similar as the effect of 
mass in this periodic structural system is observed.  
The effect of fluid velocity is also considered in this 
work. The variations of natural frequencies with 
different fluid velocity are displayed in Fig. 7. Fluid 
velocity is slow as such the velocity from zero to 
0.075m s  is also considered. Results indicate that the 
natural frequency of this system is decreased as the 
fluid flow velocity is increased. Fluid flow velocity 
may depress the natural frequency of a heat exchanger 
is clear. Finally, the tube effect on dynamic properties 
is investigated. Figure 8 illustrates the variations of 
natural frequencies with different tube thickness. The 
natural frequency of a heat exchanger is changed 
significantly by the tube thickness in this figure. In this 
figure, the natural frequency of this system is 
increased as the thickness increases is also found. In 
fact, the tube thickness can enlarge the stiffness of heat 
exchanger. The phenomenon of numerical analysis 
matches the real engineering well.
