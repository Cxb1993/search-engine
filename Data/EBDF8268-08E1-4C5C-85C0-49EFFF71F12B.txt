1-1.英文摘要 
In recent year, the traditional floating 
gate memory devices face a challenge 
about data retention with the device size 
scaling down and tunneling oxide 
thinning. Hence, using the 
oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) and the 
nanodots structure to be the trapping 
layer was proposed sequentially. These 
structures are thought to be the next 
generation of the nonvolatile memory 
devices. The SONOS memory devices 
store the data by trap the charges in the 
trap-rich nitride. The stored charges are 
not lost because the isolation of the

 2. Introduction 
Today, non-volatile memory (NVM) 
devices attract much attention as the 
requirements of portable products 
increase. However, a dry oxidation 
process, which is above 900 ℃, is the 
most common fabricating process to 
form the memory tunneling oxide. 
Applications of the current NVM are 
limited because the devices need a 
high-quality thermal oxide as the 
tunneling oxide to assure the 
charge-storage ability after a long 
duration operation. In order to low the 
fabricating temperature, 
low-temperature oxide deposited 
technologies will be critical for the next 
generation NVM. Several methods had 
been proposed to form a high-quality 
oxide at lower temperature such as the 
electron beam gun evaporation, atomic 
layer deposition and the 
supercritical-fluid treatment. However, 
aforesaid methods need an expensive 
instrument or have a throughput issue. 
Recently, nitric acid oxidation has been 
confirmed as a novel and attractive 
method to form a thin and high quality 
oxide at low temperature. We also 
believe that the nitric acid oxidation 
technology is also effective to form the 
NVM tunneling oxide. In addition, 
previous studies have shown the 
nanocrystals (NCs) devices need enough 
energy to help the NCs to aggregate. It is 
disadvantageous to apply the NCs if the 
NCs need a higher fabricating 
temperature. Self-assembled method to 
form NCs indicates that the aggregation 
of NCs depends on the initial nuclei 
formation and NCs growth rate. It had 
been proposed about the method to 
enhance the NCs aggregation through 
diffusing the additional elements to form 
more nucleation centers. Moreover, we 
believe that the similar idea that the 
nucleation process improved by the 
internal elements of the self-assembled 
layer can also enhance the NCs 
formation. In our project, we want study 
the possibility for the Al2O3 film, which 
is prepared by the nitric acid oxidation 
method, is used to be the tunneling 
oxide of CoSi2 nanocrystals (NCs) 
memory device. Also, the 
metal-insulator-silicon (MIS) structure 
was fabricated to test the quality of the 
formed Al2O3. Then, we deposited the 
self-assembled CoSi2 film to be the 
trapping layer of the memory device. 
After the fabrication of the 
metal-oxide-insulter-oxide-oxide 
(MOIOS) structure, the charge-storage 
ability of the NCs memory devices with 
the nitric acid oxidized Al2O3 as the 
tunneling oxide has been discussed by 
the material and electrical analyses. 
Moreover, we want to find the extra 
material to form the trapping layer of 
memory devices such as a high-k 
material or novel NCs. Then, we 
proposed the novel NCs memory 
structure fabricated by annealing the Ni, 
Si and Ge mixed (NiSiGe) film. After a 
RTA process, it is found that the 
annealed NiSiGe film showed a higher

 2HNO3 Æ 2NO+H2O+3O         (1) Fig. 1 (a) C-V result of the MIS (b) 
cross-section TEM images of the formed 
CoSi2 nanocrystals memory device. 
The oxidation mechanism is the 
decomposition of HNO3 provides a high 
concentration of atomic oxygen to 
oxidize the Al film. Hence, the oxidation 
can be accomplished by the brief 
immersion. Additionally, the 
aggregation of the CoSi2 NCs is 
indicated by the appearance of peak at 
778.3 eV as shown in Fig.2 (c). During 
the 700  ℃ annealing process, the 
deposited CoSi2 film tends to aggregated 
by minimizing the surface energy and 
relaxing the interface stress. Then, the 
CoSi2 NCs attribute the charge-storage 
sites for the memory application. 
Figure 1 demonstrates the C-V MIS 
structure. It is found the nitric acid 
oxidized Al2O3 (after only 400  ℃ RTA 
process) shows a negligible hysteresis 
phenomenon at ±3V gate voltage 
operation as shown as the Fig.1(a). The 
electrical results confirm that the quality 
of the Al2O3 is excellent even the oxide 
was formed by the brief nitric acid 
immersion and RTA process. Figure 1 (b)  
is the cross-section TEM images of the 
formed CoSi2 NCs memory device. 
After the 700 °C RTA process, it is 
found the Al2O3 formation and CoSi2 
NCs aggregation obviously. The formed 
Al2O3 film is about 4~5nm and the 
CoSi2 NCs are about 5nm, respectively. 
The 700℃ rapidly annealing is used to 
promote the CoSi2 NCs to aggregate. In 
addition, the quality of the nitric acid 
oxidized Al2O3 also can be further 
improved through the annealing. In 
order to confirm the Al2O3 formation 
and NCs aggregation, XPS analysis was 
used. Fig. 2 (a)~(c) shows the XPS 
results of the tunneling oxide and 
trapping layer. In the result of Al 2p 
XPS analysis (Fig.2 (a) and (b)), it is 
found that only a binding energy is 
found at ~75 eV, reported by the 
previous literature indicated as Al-O 
binding. It is believed that the deposited 
Al film is effectively oxidized after the 
brief nitric acid immersion according to 
the chemical equation (1). 
3 
 
 and electrical results assure the Al film 
can be oxidized completely after 
immersing the nitric acid solution. By 
the fabricating the MOIOS structure, the 
formed CoSi2 NCs memory reveals an 
excellent memory effect. A lower 
temperature but high-quality Al2O3 film 
is advantageous to improve the thermal 
budget issue for the thermal oxide 
demand of the conventional NCs 
memory devices.

(3.2 NiSiGe nanocrystals for nonvolatile 
memory devices) 
3-2-1 (Experiment) 
The fabrication of memory structure was 
started with a dry oxidation at 950 °C to 
form a 5 nm-thick tunneling oxide on 
p-type (100) Si wafer which had been 
removed native oxide and particles by 
RCA process. Afterward a 6-nm-thick 
NiSiGe thin film was deposited by 
co-sputtering the NiSi2 and Ge targets, 
simultaneously. Then, a 20-nm-thick 
capped oxide was deposited to form a 
tri-layer structure by plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). 
Subsequently, a rapid thermal annealing 
(RTA) at 600 °C was performed for 30s 
in N2 ambient to form NCs structure. 
After the RTA process, a 30-nm-thick 
blocking oxide (SiO2) was capped by 
PECVD system. Finally, Al gate 
electrode was patterned to form MOIOS 
structure. In addition, the structure with 
NiSi NCs was formed by the same 
process for comparison. Transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM), Raman 
spectroscopy, XPS and EDS were used 
to analyze the NCs formation. Related 
electrical measurements such as 
capacitance-voltage (C-V), retention 
measurement were used to study the 
charge-storage ability of the NCs 
memory devices. 
3-2-2 (Discussions) 
Figure 4 shows the plane-view and 
cross-sectional TEM images of the NiSi 
[Figs. 4(a) and 4(c)] and NiSiGe [Figs. 
4(b) and 4(d)] layer after thermal 
annealing process. After the 700 °C 
RTA process, it is found that the NiSi 
NCs aggregated at the tunneling oxide 
obviously. The size and density of the 
NCs (>2nm) calculated from the 
plane-view TEM is about 2~3nm and 
3.02×1011 cm-3, respectively. In addition, 
the aggregation of the NiSiGe NCs also 
can be found in annealed NiSiGe film 
(600 °C). 
 
Fig. 4 The plane-view and cross-section 
TEM micrographs of the annealed NiSi 
(a&c) and NiSiGe (b&d) film. 
It is confirmed the NiSiGe NCs, which 
is about 8~10 nm and 4.95×1011 cm-3, 
 
 electron charging and discharging effect 
of the MOIOS structure. In Fig. 6(a), the 
conventional NiSi NCs memory device 
shows flat-band voltage (VFB) shift of  
4.5V under ± 10 V gate voltage 
operation. In contrast to the NiSi NCs, 
the NiSiGe NCs memory device exhibits 
9V flat-band voltage shift in Fig. 6(b). 
The larger window of NiSiGe NCs due 
to the improved NCs formation is 
advantage to be defined as “1” or “0” for 
the logic-circuit design.

Fig. 7 Retention characteristic of the (a) 
NiSi and (b) NiSiGe NCs memory 
device. 
Figure 7 shows the retention 
characteristic of (a) NiSi NCs and (b) 
NiSiGe NCs device. It is found that the 
NiSiGe NCs device reveals better 
charge-storage ability than the NiSi NCs 
after 104 sec. The better retention 
characteristic is because the NiSiGe NCs 
have lower quantum confinement effect 
due to the larger NCs size distribution. 
Also, it is confirmed the Ge elements of 
the NiSiGe film did not damage the 
tunneling oxide quality.  
3-2-3 (Conclusion) 
In conclusion, we demonstrate the 
NiSiGe NCs memory device formed by 
annealing the NiSiGe film. It is 
confirmed the Ge element of NiSiGe 
film can offer more nucleation centers 
and enhance the NiSiGe NCs formation 
by the related material analyses. Evan at 
lower annealing temperature, the NiSiGe 
film obtains larger NCs size and higher 
density distribution. Furthermore, the 
NiSiGe NCs memory device shows 
superior charge-storage ability to the 
conventional NiSi NCs due to the 
improved NCs formation process. The 
good retention characteristic of NiSiGe 
NCs device is also advantageous to 
apply into the current memory 
fabricating process. 
(3.3 Nitric Acid Oxidation of Si for the 
Tunneling Oxide Application on CoSi2 
Nanocrystals Nonvolatile Memory) 
3-3-1 (Experiment) 
 
Fig. 1 The process flow proposed in this 
work. 
Figure 1 is the process flow of the 
experiment. The fabrication of the 
memory structure started with a 
sputtering process to form a Si thin film 
about 2 nm thick on a p-type (100) Si 
wafer, from which native oxide and 
particles had been removed by the RCA 
process. Then, the Si film was immersed 
in nitric acid solution (HNO3:H2O = 
1:10) for 60 s at room temperature to 
 
 Fig. 3 The Si 2p XPS spectra of (a) the 
as-deposited Si film and the NAO-SiO2 
(b) before and (c) after the RTA set at 
700°C for 30 s. 
indicates that the NAO-SiO2 without 
serious leakage current has potential for 
the application of the electric device. In 
the J-V result, a nonsymmetric leakage 
behavior was obvious. The higher gate 
injection current density under negative 
gate voltage resulted from the electrons 
injected from the Al gate to the Si 
substrate. In contrast, a current 
saturation of the J-V characteristic is 
found when a positive gate bias is 
applied because the gate leakage current 
in the deep depletion region is related to 
the generation of minority carriers via 
the bulk traps and interface states in the 
depletion region. 
Figure 3 demonstrates the Si 2p XPS 
spectra of (a) the as-deposited Si film 
and the NAO-SiO2 (b) before and (c) 
after the RTA at 700°C for a 30 s 
process. Figure 3a shows a peak at about 
99.3 eV corresponding to the Si–Si 
bonding energy. We found an additional 
peak at about 103 eV, which is 
attributed to the native oxide formed 
during the sample fabrication. After the 
nitric acid immersion, an obvious 
transition of Si elements to SiO2 shows 
that most of the as-deposited Si film was 
oxidized by the nitric acid solution, as 
shown in Fig. 3b. The oxidation 
mechanism of the nitric acid oxidation 
explains that the decomposition of 
HNO3 can provide a high concentration 
of atomic oxygen with a strong 
oxidizing ability to oxidize the sputtered 
Si film. In addition, some suboxide 
(SiOx,x < 2) is found in Fig. 3b, which 
confirms that the oxide still has a poorer 
quality. As an annealing temperature 
was used to improve the oxide quality, 
the Si–O peak was shifted toward higher 
binding energies and the suboxide 
element was reduced. Hence, the 
oxidation was accomplished by the brief 
nitric acid immersion and a POA 
treatment. To study the feasibility for the 
NAO-SiO2 layer to be applied to the NC 
memory device, the MOIOS structure 
was fabricated and measured. After the  
9 
 
 diffuse into the Si substrate even after a 
700°C thermal annealing process, as 
shown in Fig. 5d. We also used a 
secondary-ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) 
to further study the possibility of Co 
contamination. 
 
Fig. 6 The SIMS analysis of the CoSi2 
NCs memory device. 
Figure 6 shows the results of SIMS 
analysis for the CoSi2 NCs memory 
device. The main Co signal only 
accumulated at the tunneling oxide. 
Hence, it is believed that the Co 
contamination issue of the CoSi2 
memory device using the NAO-SiO2 
thin film as tunneling oxide can be 
excluded. 
 
11 
Fig. 7 The (a) C-V and (b) J-V curve of 
the MOIOS structure using the 
NAO-SiO2 as device tunneling oxide. 
Figure 7a shows the high frequency (1 
MHz) C-V curves of the formed CoSi2 
NC memory structure. When the gate 
voltage of the device was swept by a ±
10 V operation, a floating-band voltage 
shift of 7 V was observed. The 
counterclockwise C-V hysteresis loops 
mean that the injected carrier is related 
to the inversion layer of the Si substrate. 
The obvious memory window of NC 
memory devices is advantageous as the 
judgment of the logic circuit. In addition, 
the J-V characteristic of MOIOS 
structure was also investigated, as 
shown in Fig. 7b. Compared with the 
J-V result of the MIS structure in Fig. 2b, 
the MOIOS structure shows a lower 
leakage characteristic and symmetric 
behavior. The result is attributed to 
blocking oxide, which restrains the 
passing charge in both the positive and 
the negative gate voltage modes. To 
study the reliability characteristics of the 
formed CoSi2 NC memory device, 
retention and endurance characteristics 
were also demonstrated. The retention 
characteristic of the MOIOS structure 
was extracted by the capacitance–time 
measurement, as shown in Fig. 8a. The 
normalized capacitance, △ Cret, is 
defined as Eq. 1 
△Cret = [C(t) − CFB]/[C(0) − CFB]  (1) 
where C(0), C(t), and CFB are the initial 
capacitance after the programming 
operation, the measured capacitance 
during the retention test, and the referred 
capacitance defined at flatband voltage, 
respectively. The △Cret of the memory 
device can be stable at about 48% of the 
initial capacitance after a 104 s test even 
with an obvious 20% capacitance drop 
within the first 100 s. In addition, we 
 
 layer during exposure to atmosphere. 
Subsequently, a rapid temperature 
annealing was carried out at different 
temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 °C 
for 2 min to format NCs dots. After the 
samples were annealed, another 30 nm 
thick silicon oxide, i.e., a total thickness 
of 40 nm including the previous oxide, 
was deposited to act as a blocking oxide. 
Finally, a 500 nm thick Al gate electrode 
was deposited and patterned by shadow 
mask to form a capacitor structure. For 
comparison, control samples with only a 
10 nm thick TiSi2 film as a trapping 
layer were also fabricated in the same 
following conditions.

3-4-2 (Discussions) 
 
FIG. 1 Shows cross-sectional TEM of 
the Ti-based germanosilicide samples 
after annealed at (a) 500 °C and (b) 600 
°C. 
Figure 1 shows cross-sectional 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
of the Ti-based germanosilicide samples 
after annealed at (a) 500 °C and (b) 600 
°C. Formation of NCs dots were 
observed in both of the samples 
annealed at 500 and 600 °C in Fig. 1. 
Nevertheless, a continuous Tibased 
germanosilicide film was observed to be 
maintained even after a 400 °C 
annealing treatment (not showed here). 
According to the TEM results, therefore, 
a higher temperature treatment than 400 
°C was essential to separate the 10 nm 
thick blanket Ti-based germanosilicide 
layer into NCs structures. The size of 
NCs also expanded to ~9 nm with a 
higher thermal treatment of 600 °C. 
 
FIG. 2 (a) Shows a comparison on 
overall region XPS spectra between the 
Ti-based germanosilicide samples 
annealed at 500 and 600 °C. Figures 
2(b)–2(d) show XPS of Si, Ge, and Ti 
on the samples after annealed at 500 °C, 
respectively. 
Figure 2(a) shows x-ray 
photon-emission spectroscopy (XPS) 
spectra of overall region on the Ti-based 
germanosilicide samples annealed at 500 
and 600 °C, detected with Ar ion milling 
of the 10 nm thick blocking oxide. The 
elemental Ti, Si, Ge peaks appeared in 
the sample annealed at 500 °C. However, 
after undergoing a 600 °C 
heat-treatment, the Si and Ti peaks still 
can be detected and nearly intact with 
the exception of Ge peaks, indicating 
thermal desorption of Ge atoms occurred 
severely. From the point of view of 
quantitative XPS analysis, the atomic 
 
 NVMs applications were almost 
fabricated above this temperature. 
Therefore, we suggest that the exhibition 
of large memory effect was strongly 
associated with the addition of Ge in 
Ti-based NCs, but not Ge or TiO2 NCs 
only.

FIG. 4 Shows retention and endurance 
characteristics of the 
titania-germano-silicide NCs memory 
capacitor annealed at 500 °C. 
Figure 4 shows retention and endurance 
characteristics of the 
titania-germano-silicide NCs memory 
capacitor annealed at 500 °C. After the 
device was operated in the 
program/erase of +5 V/−5 V condition, 
the memory window retained ~0.93 V 
after 107 sec as well as ~3.5 V after 105 
times programmed /erased cycles. 
3-4-3 (Conclusion) 
In conclusion, the memory effects of the 
titania-germano-silicide NCs fabricated 
by cosputtering titanium silicide and 
germanium targets were fabricated and 
demonstrated at relatively low 
temperature of 500 °C due to the 
presence of Ge atoms. The thermal 
desorption of Ge atoms was also 
observed to degrade the characteristic of 
threshold voltage shift severely while 
further increasing the annealing 
temperature to 600 °C.
