一、中文摘要
面臨世界金融危機的衝擊，在各
行各業不景氣的情況下，勢必要開源節
流 。 「 供 應 商 管 理 存 貨 」
(Vendor-Managed Inventory；VMI)，即
是企業為了使生產和銷售目標順利達
成而採用之一種有效的快速回應管理
利器。
本計畫考慮與實際狀況較為契合之供
應鏈，即一家核心廠 (例如，友達光電 )
與供應商之多階層 (例如，三階層 )VMI
系統，首先定義操作性變數之符號與提
出基本假設，建構數學規劃模式，發展
有效的求解方法，並進行實驗設計及求
解效能分析。然而，本計畫因為模式為
NP-hard，故將針對小型問題使用數學
規劃套裝軟體 (LINGO)求最佳解，所求
得的最佳解用來評估本計畫基因演算
法 (GA)的求解效能。本計畫期望以此存
貨整合模式來改變過去供應鏈廠商單
獨擬定決策，轉以合作方式降低成本，
維持供應鏈長期穩固合作關係，最終使
得整體供應鏈更具競爭力。此外，本計
畫的實證結果與業界的觀點和實際情
形非常吻合，印證本計畫實證結果的正
確性，希望藉由本計畫案例提供未來研
究導入 VMI 的廠商之重要參考依據。
關鍵詞：供應商管理存貨、薄型液晶顯

Abstract
In the face of the seriously
economical crisis in today’s world, 
businesses in each industry should save
costs and make an effort to find
profitable opportunit ies in the situation
where the global economics is in a state
of deep depression. The main purpose of
this project is to construct an integrated
VMI system. The VMI system (e.g., a
three-level supply chain) includes a core
TFT-LCD company (i.e., AU Optronics
Corporation (AUO)) and its up-stream
vendors. This project first defines the
notations of operational variables and
makes the basic assumptions. Then, an
optimization package (e.g., LINGO) is
used for the small-scale problems since
the problem has been proven to be
NP-hard. For the reason of difficultly
obtaining an optimal solution, an
effective heuristic method (i .e., genetic
algorithm) is applied for solving the
large-scale problems. In addition, an
experiment and a computational
efficiency analysis will be also
conducted. It is hoped that our model
can be used as an effective approach for
VMI supply chain practitioners to
cooperatively make their procurement,
production, and delivery decisions, to
maintain long-term stable partnerships,
and to improve global competition.
4作的重要因素並與去年的結果對照。
(3)基因演算法（使用 Gene Hunter 2.4
軟體）：基因演算法也是一種人工智慧
(artificial intelligence)搜尋技術，取法
於自然界「物競天擇，適者生存」之道。
每一物種在某一特定的環境中，彼此競
爭、淘汰，最後只留下適應性強的物
種 。 故 其 最 基 本 之 精 神 即 在 演 化
(evolution)及篩選 (selection)。所謂演化
就是經由個體的複製 (reproduction)、交
配 (crossover)及 突 變 (mutation)去 產 生
出新的個體，作不同的嘗試。
四、改善後三階層供應鏈斐氏圖與 VMI
數學規劃模式建構
目前三階層供應鏈很少有關於VMI
流程圖之文獻和斐氏圖相關的廠商制
度資料，且牽涉到三階層相關之文獻非
常缺乏。圖 1為導入VMI改善後的斐氏
流程，改善後VMI斐氏圖暫態與激態之
意義如表 1所示。

PC:供料 t2:訂料轉換機制與排程敲
t3:供料商接收到訂料需求

t4:製造商接收到品項需求
資訊後，運送回品項給
PA 組裝
友達接到顧客下達訂單之後，將訂
單轉換成需求用背光模組 (Back Light;
B/L)批量數，籍由電子資料交換 (EDI)
系統分享給中強光電敲定自動補貨排
程，中強光電配合友達之排程向千代田
光電分享需求用導光版 (LGP)批量數與
敲定自動補貨排程，千代田光電將生產
製造 LGP 缺少之需求量，依 VMI 雙方
所 敲 定 之 排 程 運 送 回 中 強 光 電 進 行
B/L 組裝，中強光電進而生產製造 B/L
缺少之需求量，依 VMI 雙方所敲定之
排程運送回友達進行 TFT-LCD 生產。
為求得供應鏈各成員在計畫期內
的最適訂購、製造或供料次數 (N1、N2
或 N3)及最適補貨週期時間 (t1、 t2；可
由 n1 和 n2 計算而得 )，使供應鏈 VMI
總成本最低。三階層 VMI 數學規劃模
式建構如下：
(一)計畫期內核心廠總成本：
計畫期內的核心廠總成本包括訂
購成本、存貨持有成本、資訊分享成本
C1 (N 1 , n 1 ) = S 1 N1 + h 1 [ + ]
+ I N 1 (1)
(二 )計畫期內製造商總成本：
計畫期內的製造商總成本包括訂
購與生產設置成本、品項與關鍵零組件
存貨持有成本、運送成本和補貨成本、
資訊分享成本和製造商管理存貨成本
C2 (N 1 , N2 , N3 , n 1 , n 2 ) = (S 2 + )N2 + (U1 (N1 , N2 ,
n 1 ) + U2 ( N 3 , n 2 ) )+ (M + a + ) n 1 N2
+ (I + F)N2 (2)
其中 U1(N1 , N2 , n1)為品項存貨持有成
本，U2(N3 , n2)為關鍵零組件存貨持有
成本
6個測試問題 10 次複算之後，本計畫 VMI
數學規劃模式利用啟發式基因演算法
與非線性優化軟體所求得之解值差異
不大，平均求解時間啟發式基因演算法
為 3.2 秒，明顯比非線性優化軟體 8.1
秒更快，所得結論為中、小型問題採用
數學非線性規劃軟體求解就可以了，但
如遇到中、大型問題時，則採用本計畫
啟發式基因演算法求解較好 (用 LINGO
需花較多的時間才可求得結果 )。
(三 )經 由 實 驗 設 計 和 模 式 比 較 之
後 ， 總 平 均 目 標 函 數 值 偏 離 值 為
5.9%，平均求解時間比值為 39.4%。結
果顯示當生產率、需求率、生產設置成
本、儲存成本、資訊分享成本、運送成
本、供應商管理存貨成本快速變動時，
本計畫所提出之啟發式基因算法在求解
方面展現極高的效率性和實用性，當求
解大型問題時效果更為顯著。
(四)敏感度分析結果顯示，除供料商單位
時間的材料生產率(p2)、其它重要參數包括製
造商每次生產設置成本(S2’)、供料商每次生產
設置成本(S3)、核心廠每件貨品的月儲存成本
(h1)、製造商每件貨品的月儲存成本(h2)、製
造商每件材料的月儲存成本(h3)、供料商每件
材料的月儲存成本(h4)、每批次運送貨品或材
料的成本(M)、每次訂購、製造或供料所發生
的資訊分享成本(I)、供應商管理存貨成本(F)
等均對總成本有顯著的影響。因此供應鏈成
員須謹慎估計上述相關參數，並應善加運用
VMI 技術亦能降低整體供應鏈總成本。
(五)本計畫啟發式演算法輸入當期相關
參數，可求得最佳訂購、製造、供料、分批
交貨次數，能夠有效減少訂購行政作業、降
低運送車次，故本計畫模式能使供應鏈總成
本下降，提升整體供應鏈之競爭力。
(六 )導入 VMI 斐氏圖流程改善，預
期之成效為能夠提升訂貨速度且節省
人力和敲定排程所花費之時間，碰到問
題 時 雙 方 能 夠 快 速 回 應 降 低 最 大 損
失，且迅速將整體供應鏈排程重新調整
而準時交貨，大幅降低庫存管理費用並
節省人力資源與降低錯誤發生機率，亦
能提高配送載運量、降低運送成本。

3. 論文題目：Amendment to proactive supplier distribution channels — An  
 analytical framework  
發表者：Ying Zong 
發表日期：June 29, 2010, 11:30~12:30 (Session B3) 
摘要：The retailer-led channels improve market prosperities and people's living 
standards, but it is established in certain background. However, with the changes 
of the market situations of circulation channels, the problems emerged in the 
mismatch between the channel members who are strongly driven by economic 
interests and have different channel information and the problems occurred in 
channels efficiency losses objectively demand the original circulation channels 
to be continuously adjusted, re-designed and selected, That's to say, the original 
retailer-led circulation channels need to be amended. From the perspective of 
proactive suppliers, this paper, which respectively regards the retailers, the 
suppliers and the consumers' information feedback system as the breakthrough 
point of amendment, focuses mainly on two-way evaluation system directed at 
retailers and suppliers, and then builds an initiative research framework based on 
proactive suppliers' circulation channels. Furthermore, this article, taking the 
fast-moving-consumer-goods model and the channels of supermarkets as the 
examples, analyzes the model's operation mechanism and optimization of the 
revised channels. It is hoped that the paper can provide reasonable reference for 
retailer-led distribution channels.

發表者：Jen-Shiang Chen 
發表日期：June 29, 2010, 14:00~14:30 (Session D4) 
摘要：This study considers together machine scheduling and finished product 
delivery. A single machine scheduling model is developed that incorporated 
delivery vehicle routing decisions which serves one customer location with 
multiple vehicles. The objective is to minimize makespan. The problem is 
NP-hard in the strong sense in general. A mixed binary integer programming 
model is developed to optimally solve this problem. Also, an illustrated example 
is proposed to find the optimal schedule using the proposed model.

significant changes in services or their production or
delivery and the reconfiguration or improvement of
existing service (Eurostat, 1995; Gallouj and Weinstein,
1997; Miles, 1994). Service innovations are not new to
the world, but they may still be new to your company,
customers, or network partners (Gustafsson and Johnson,
2003).
Due to dynamics and displaying features, service
innovation requires new theories and instruments (Djellal
and Gallouj, 2001). In addition, it is necessary for the
service industry to take a broad view of innovation and
innovation processes (Damanpour, Walker and
Avellaneda, 2009; Gallouj and Weinstein, 1997). To
improve the understanding of innovative activities in
service industries, den Hertog, Broersma and van Ark
(2003) proposed the four-dimension model. The four
dimensions are ‘new service concept’, ‘new client
interface’, ‘new service delivery system’ and
‘technological options’and any service innovation
involves a specific combination of the four dimensions.
There are some other viewpoints discussing the service
innovation model: Tether (2005) contended that it would
be better for service firms to innovate through
collaborating with customers and suppliers; Leiponen
(2005) found that innovation in service firms is affected
by external knowledge, especially from customers and
competitors; Maffei et al. (2005) proposed a model based
on the source of service innovation, i.e. from the
company itself, the competitors, the customers and the
suppliers.
However, the above models focus on the delivery end
of service innovation. That is they concentrate how to
generate and provide service innovation. They do not
consider user mindset towards accepting service
innovation. This may influence the diffusion of service
innovation in the acceptance end.
2.2 Social Learning Theory
A technology-based service innovation is usually more
complicated (den Hertog, Broersma and van Ark, 2003),
thus learning of this innovation is essentially required.
Social learning theory proposed by Bandura (1977) is the
theory that people learn new behavior through overt
reinforcement or punishment, or via observational
learning of the social factors in their environment. If
people observe positive, desired outcomes in the
observed behavior, then they are more likely to model,
imitate, and adopt the behavior themselves. In this study,
both the positive and negative observation outcomes
resulted in learning behavior of individuals are explored.
2.3 Evidence-based Medicine
The idea of EBM was initiated by clinical
epidemiologists at McMaster University in Canada
(Haynes, 2002). Cohen et al. (2004) pointed out that the
core concepts of EBM originated by applying the
principles of epidemiology to the practice of patient care
during the 1970s and 1980s. EBM is a tool used to
integrate the best research evidence, clinical expertise
and patient values into the practice of patient care
(Cohen et al., 2004; Delvenne and Pasleau, 2003; Haynes,
2002; Sackett, et al., 2000).
The basic scenario for the usage of an EBM system is
described as follows. An EBM server, which consists of
a knowledge database system, a management system and
medical knowledge sources, functions as a platform of
knowledge management. It mainly provides a medical
knowledge database for any linked user (or client). Users
can access the EBM system to acquire medical
information and knowledge through a search engine.
Furthermore, suggested solutions can be provided to
support decision-making in medical treatment (Cheng et
al., 2009). The practice of EBM is a rigorously
systematic and scientific way of learning and
applications. The operational steps (Gambrill, 1999;
Delvenne and Pasleau, 2003) are: 1. Convert information
needs into answerable clinical questions; 2. Find the best
evidence with maximum efficiency; 3. Critically appraise
that evidence; 4. Apply this appraisal to developing
solutions; 5. Constantly evaluate the performance.
Evidence-based medicine’s (EBM’s) potential to
support medical research, improve medical quality and
reduce costs has galvanized clinicians, policy-makers,
insurers and others in health care to speed its
implementation in hospitals (Scalise, 2005b). Although
the concept of EBM has been around for three decades,
hospital leaders have paid serious attention to EBM only
within the last three years (Scalise, 2005a). In Taiwan,
EBM is new to many hospitals so it is viewed as one
kind of technology-based service innovation within the
hospital industry.
2.4 Related human-technology studies
2.4.1 Human computer interaction (HCI)
In recent research HCI studies have concentrated on
user experience (McCarthy and Wright, 2004). The main
stream in HCI issues has a trend for emphasizing the
perceptual and experienced sensitivity of users. The
researchers in this school place emphasis on the
relationship between human and technology from the
perspective of esthetics. They emphasize the importance
of human experience and further contend that the human
experience is fed back to technological design (Norman,
1988). For the HCI design issues, there are some studies
concentrating the viewpoint of usability. Usability
consisting of certain quality indicators is used to evaluate
whether the technology is ease of use and whether the
technology can make users definitely, directly,
sensitively and effectively carry out their work (Ferreira
and Pithan, 2005). However, the emotion and aesthetic
experience of users are receiving more attention on the
design of human-machine interaction (Hasswnzahl, Beu
and Burmetester, 2001). The designers also transfer their
focus to the emotional reactions of general users
(Shneiderman, 2004). Moreover, McCarthy and Wright
(2004) contended that the interaction between humans
and the environment becomes a way of participation and
communication when humans completely experience and
grasp the existent situation.

4. RESEARCH FINDINGS AND PROPOSITIONS
Based on social learning theory we establish the EBM
service innovation acceptance model shown in Figure 1.
According to the conceptual diagram, the induced
constructs and corresponding propositions are described
as follows.
4.1 The relationship between perceived advantage
and learning intention
The perceived advantages of physicians towards
accepting the EBM system are induced as ‘perceived
cognitive advantage’ and ‘perceived emotional
advantage’. The two constructs are described as follows.
4.1.1 Perceived cognitive advantage
The perceived cognitive advantages of physicians
towards accepting the EBM system are induced as
‘supportiveness’, ‘efficiency’, and ‘quality’. The
examples of quotations are shown in Table III.
4.1.2 Perceived emotional advantage
The perceived emotional advantages of physicians
towards accepting the EBM system are induced as
‘fashion’, ‘confidence’, ‘pride’, ‘enjoyment’ and
‘embodiment’. The examples of quotations are shown in
Table IV.
4.1.3 Propositions
The following propositions are developed based on
social learning theory.
Proposition 1: The perceived advantage is positively
related to learning intention towards EBM service
innovation.
Proposition 1.1: The perceived cognitive advantage is
positively related to learning intention towards EBM
service innovation.
Proposition 1.2: The perceived emotional advantage is
positively related to learning intention towards EBM
service innovation.
4.2 The relationship between perceived anxiety and
learning intention
The perceived anxiety of physicians towards accepting
the EBM system are induced as ‘Information anxiety’,
‘Patient education’, ‘Patient misunderstanding’,
‘Colleague competitiveness’, and ‘Coercive force of
institution’. The examples of quotations are shown in
Table V. We establish the following proposition:
Proposition 2: The perceived anxiety is positively
related to learning intention towards EBM service
innovation.
4.3 The relationship between learning intention and
learning infusion
Innovation learning plays an important role in the
process of accepting a technology-based service
innovation. In the study, the innovation learning is
induced as two stages: ‘learning intention’and ‘learning
infusion’. The higher learning intention is, the higher
learning infusion becomes. For examples: “It (perceived
advantage) can promote my desire to learn and hence I
actually devote myself in the EBM training courses.”
“This (perceived anxiety) initiates my intention to learn
it (EBM) … So I have to participate in the training
courses.”There are many conversations showing the
same viewpoints. Therefore,
Proposition 3: Learning intention towards EBM service
innovation is positively related to learning infusion
towards EBM service innovation.
Proposition 3 is partly matched with the theory of
planned behavior proposed by Ajzen (1985). Behavioral
intention is an indication of an individual's readiness to
perform a given behavior. It is assumed to be immediate
antecedent of behavior, which means an individual's
observable response in a given situation with respect to a
given target (Ajzen, 2002).
5. CONCLUSIONS
This study uses the case of EBM realization to propose
a technology-based service innovation acceptance model
based on social learning theory. The model concerns
‘perceived advantage’and ‘perceived anxiety’of users
(antecedents), ‘learning intention’ (mediator), and
‘learning infusion’ (consequence). The ‘perceived
advantage’ is the positive outcome observed by
individuals and it includes perceived cognitive advantage
and perceived emotional advantage. The ‘perceived
anxiety’is the negative outcome observed by individuals
and it includes information anxiety, patient education,
patient misunderstanding, colleague competitiveness and
coercive force of institution. Besides there are three
propositions induced from the study. This study
theoretically initiates the perspective towards accepting
technology-based service innovations based on social
learning theory. As for the practical contribution, this
study provides a more specific and complete viewpoint
towards accepting technology-based service innovations.
