ABSTRACT
In this study, white-light ZnO based phosphor was synthesized by solid-state reaction
method. The activators were europium (Eu), yttrium (Y), tungsten (W), gallium (Ga), cerium
(Ce), gallium (Ga), and the fluxes were lithium (Li) and potassium (K) elements. The doping
concentrations of activators and fluxes were varied to find the optimum doping concentration,
meanwhile, the sintering temperature and sintering time were optimized. In addition, the
synthesized phosphor was ground with different time and frequencies to obtain fine particles of
phosphor. From the measurements, it shows that the luminescence properties of ZnO phosphors
were strongly influenced by the synthesis conditions. The field emission display (FED) and
electroluminescence device (ELD) were prepared with the optimized characteristics of phosphor.
The luminescence properties of phosphor film, FED and ELD were measured and discussed. The
characteristics of white-light ZnO based phosphor were presented in several symposiums and
published in the journals; a patent is applied and is under examined.
INTRODUCTION
Luminescence is the emission of light generated by low temperatures. It is different from
incandescence occurring at high temperatures. It can be emitted by photoluminescence,
cathodoluminescence, electroluminescence, thermoluminescence, chemiluminescence,
bioluminescence, and triboluminescence. Luminescence is also a process in which the molecule
in the excite state relaxes to the ground state by radiation to release energy [1-3]. The radiation
process can be divided into fluorescence and phosphorescence by the decay time. The different
between fluorescence and phosphorescence is that the fluorescence doesn’t involve the change of 
the spin. The life time of the fluorescence is 10-9 ~ 10-5 s and the life time of the phosphorescence
is 10 -4 ~ 10 s. The reason of the short lifetime for fluorescence is that the S1→S0 transition is
dipole-allowed, and the long lifetime of phosphorescence is because of the low probability of
T1→S0 transition [4,5]. The luminescence property of the phosphor is dependent on the elements,
4analysis (EDX) was used to analyze the chemical characterization of phosphor. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) is a measurement technique used to identify the crystalline property of materials. The
JEOL, JAMP-9500F Auger electron spectroscopy with a Mg Kαphoton source of 500 W and the
binding energy (BE) ranging from 0 to 1100 eV, was used for XPS measurement of the sample.
The Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 150 W xenon lamp and a
monochrometer was used to measure the PL spectra and PLE spectra of phosphor under room
temperature. The commission internationale de l′Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and luminescence
properties of devices were measured by Konica Minolta CS-100A colorimeter.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1(a) shows the ZnO:Ce phosphor prepared with 2 mol% Ce doping concentration,
which was sintered at 1000 for 8 hours.℃ Its CIE coordinates is located at (0.38, 0.42). It shows
that this is a yellow-green phosphor. Figure 1(b) shows the ZnO:Y phosphor prepared with 3
mol% Y doping concentration, which was sintered at 1300 for 8 hours℃ ; its CIE coordinates was
located at (0.29, 0.45), was a green phosphor. And Fig. 1(c) shows the CIE coordinates of the
ZnO:WO3, where the doping concentration of WO3 was 50 mol% and the sintering temperature
was at 1100℃. The CIE coordinates were much closed to (0.24, 0.29). Fig. 1(d) shows the CIE
coordinates for the ZnO:Eu2O3 phosphor prepared with 3 mol% of Eu doping, which was sintered
at 950 for℃ 4 hours. Its CIE coordinates is located at (0.41, 0.41), was a yellow phosphor. Figure
1(e) shows the CIE coordinates of ZnO:Ga2O3 phosphor. It is observed that when the Ga doping
concentration 4 mol%, the near white light emission phosphors could be acquired; the CIE
coordinates were (0.32, 0.34). From the measurements of CIE coordinates, it was found that the
ZnO-based phosphors was not a pure white emission; the maximum emission intensity was
obtained from the ZnO:WO3. Hence, complementary phosphor was adopted to achieve
white-light emission. Figure 1(f) shows the CIE coordinates of Y2O3:Eu,Li mixed with ZnO:WO3
phosphor. The Li-doped Y2O3:Eu2O3 phosphor was doped with 11 mol% of Eu dopant and 20

6The XRD patterns of the K+-doped ZnWO4 phosphor showed that the crystallinity of
phosphor did not change significantly when the temperature was increased. The peaks (200) and
(220) were enhanced as the temperature was increased. The SEM images of the K+-doped
ZnWO4 phosphor prepared at 700 and 900℃ are shown in Fig. 3. The particle size of phosphor
was increased with the sintering temperature, and it was about 2-10μm. The PL measurements of
the K+-doped ZnWO4 phosphor with different sintering temperatures showed that the highest
luminous intensity was obtained when it was synthesized at 900℃. The luminescence was
increased 30%, when the doping concentration of KCl was 7 mol%, as shown in Fig. 4.

FIG. 4. PL properties of the ZnWO4 phosphor without and with 7 mol% K+ doping.
In order to prepare fine particle of K+-doped ZnWO4 phosphor, the phosphor powder was
ground. It was observed that a high grinding frequency (≧15 Hz) led to severe surface crack of
the phosphor. When the grinding frequency was above 25 Hz, the particle of phosphor was
broken. The PL spectra of the K+-doping ZnWO4 phosphor show that when the grinding
frequency increased, the luminous intensity was increased. Nevertheless, when the grinding
frequency was above 20 Hz, structural damage of the phosphor resulted in a decreased PL
intensity. It was found that the luminance of the phosphor after grinding was increased around
10.97, 16.53, 21.13, 25.36 and 3.62% when the grinding frequency was increased from 5 to 25
Hz. The luminance intensity was declined because of immoderate grinding at high frequency of
20 Hz.
The SEM images of the K+-doped ZnWO4 phosphor prepared with grinding frequency at 20
Hz. It is observed that when the grinding time was increased, the particle of phosphor was
cracked. A clear rift was observed when it was ground for 2 minutes, and the particle was broken
when the grinding time was over 3 minutes. Structural damage of the phosphor particle led to a
reduced luminescence when the grinding time was over 2 minutes. The luminescence was
enhanced around 9.63%, 25.36% and 3.08% as the phosphor was ground for 1, 2 3 min,
respectively. When the phosphor was ground over 3 minutes, over grinding led to structural
damage, consequently, the luminescence was decreased significantly. Figure 5 shows the PL
spectra of the K+-doped ZnWO4 phosphor with and without grinding; the grinding frequency was
set at 20 Hz and the phosphor was ground for 1 min.
In this study, the white-light ZnO based phosphors on FED and ELD applications were
carried out. The white-light phosphor was consisted of K+-doped ZnWO4, the ZnO based
phosphor, and the complementary phosphor of Y2O3:Eu,Li. Figure 6(a) shows the performance
image of FED in which the field emitters were ZnO nanorods and the white-light phosphor screen
was made of mixed phosphor by screen printing. The emission area of FED was 2×2 cm2. When

CONCLUSIONS
For the preparation of white-light ZnO based phosphors, it was found that white-light
phosphor was obtained from the ZnWO4, the emission color could be improved by
complementing with phosphor of Y2O3:Eu,Li. In the mean time, the addition of KCl flux
enhanced the luminance of phosphor. When the fine particles of phosphor were obtained by
grinding, a higher luminance was achieved. The optimal grinding parameters were frequency at
20 Hz and ground for 1 min.
