ABSTRACT 
Multilayer titanium photonic crystals are fabricated with the mature integrated circuit (IC) technology, which is similar 
to the Damascene interconnect process. The photonic crystals that we created have the face-centered-tetragonal lattice 
symmetry. In each layer, the feature size, height and the spacing of the titanium rods is 100 nm, 200 nm and 300 nm, 
respectively. To our knowledge, this is at the first time that the three-dimensional titanium photonic crystals are realized 
successfully with 100-nm line width. The reflectance spectra of three- and four-layer titanium photonic crystals are 
measured with the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and simulated with the three-dimensional finite different 
time domain method. Through both the experimental observation and the calculation verification, the characterization 
of the photonic band gap is demonstrated at near-infrared wavelengths and the optical behavior of titanium photonic 
crystals is discussed for incident light waves of s- and p-polarization. Moreover, the absorption spectra are derived from 
the reflectance and transmittance spectra due to the law of conservation of energy. It is found that absorption near the 
photonic band edge is modified and enhanced in a narrow bandwidth because of the well-known recycling-energy 
mechanism. The large band gap can suppress black body radiation in the mid-infrared range and recycle energy into the 
near infrared. According to Kirchoff’s law, the absorptance of a body equals its emissivity. Thus, the multilayer 
titanium photonic crystals would be applied as an efficient near-infrared light source with a narrow bandwidth, and 
produced on a mass scale with the standard IC technology.  
Keywords: Metallic photonic crystals, nano optics. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Photonic crystals (PCs) are artificial materials with periodic changes in the dielectric constants, analogous to crystal 
structures of semiconductors, and the photonic band gaps (PBGs) can be created for certain ranges of photonic energies 
[1]. Three-dimensional (3D) PCs can provide complete band gaps, in which the propagation of electromagnetic waves 
is prohibited for all wave vectors. Among a variety of proposed 3D PC structures, the so-called woodpile structure is 
attractive for its large PBG and simple design rule [2]. This structure has been successfully realized with dielectric 
materials by some state-of-the-art technologies, such as wafer bonding [3], multiphoton lithography [4] and atomic 
layer deposition [5]. Metallic PCs have been investigated for the last decade. The special electromagnetic phenomenon, 
as efficient light sources, has been demonstrated [6] due to their large band gaps and the absorbing properties. Such a 
large band gap could suppress broadband blackbody radiation at the mid-infrared wavelengths, and recycle its energy 
into the high frequency range. Therefore, it has been suggested that 3D metallic PCs may be useful for the incandescent 
lamp application and the thermal photovoltaic power generation [7]. However, fabricating 3D metallic PCs in a large 
scale is still a challenge. 
In this report, we use mature integrated circuit (IC) technology, which is like Damascene interconnect process to 
accomplish 3D titanium photonic crystals with 100-nm feature sizes. By means of this method, 3D Ti PCs can keep 
good quality in an area of 5×5 mm. To probe the PBG properties of 3D titanium PCs, we use a Fourier-transform 
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer to measure polarization dependence of the samples, and confirm the measurement results 
by the 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Moreover, thermal emission spectra taken from the 3D 
titanium PCs are shown and compared to the measured reflectance spectra.

and (d) cross-sectional view of the four-layer titanium PC. The width and height of titanium rods are 100 nm and 200 nm, 
respectively. The rod-to-rod spacing is 300 nm.  Some misalignment appears between the second-nearest neighboring layers, such 
as the second and the fourth layers. The rod width of the third layer is reduced due to deviation in the RIE process for the titanium 
film. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Measured Spectra at Normal Incidence 
To investigate the PBG behaviors of 3D titanium PCs, we measure the samples by the FTIR spectrometer (BRUKER 
H2K) at normal and grazing incidence of light. This FTIR spectrometer is equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and a 
mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector for mid-infrared wavelength range. When measuring for near-infrared 
wavelength range, the beamsplitter and the detector would be changed as a CaF2 beamsplitter and an InGaAs detector. 
In our experiment, the reflectance spectra as shown in Fig. 3, are normalized to that of a gold mirror.

Fig. 3 Measured reflectance spectra of the 3D titanium PCs at normal incidence. The incident light is (a) unpolarized, (b) s and p 
polarized. In this report, s- and p-polarization is defined as the electric field of incident light parallel and perpendicular to extension 
direction of titanium rods in the most upper layer, respectively. 
The four-layer titanium PC exhibits higher reflectance than the three-layer one for wavelengths  7≧  m　 , and the 
reflectance decreases sharply at shorter wavelengths. It can be seen that the four-layer sample shows clearer PBG 
behavior than the three-layer one, because the four layer structure forms a unit cell of a FCT lattice. As shown in Fig. 
3(a), the photonic band edge locates at a wavelength of 5 　m (where reflectance = 0.5) for the 3D titanium PC along 
the <001> axis. Comparing with a 3D copper PC [8], a titanium PC exhibits a band edge at longer wavelengths. Since 
the plasma frequency of titanium is lower than that of copper, intrinsic absorption from titanium metal plays an 
important role at wavelengths ＜ 7 　m, resulting in the band edge of the titanium PC locating at a wavelength much 
longer than its feature size. To understand the material dependence on the PBG, we consider the simplest case, 
reflection and absorption by metal films. The reflectance at the interface of metal and air for the case of normal 
incidence is given by

Fig. 6 Measured reflectance spectra of the four-layer titanium PC at grazing-angle incidence. The angles of incidence beam is from 
52.2° to 84.2° at a time. The tilt-angle geometry is as shown in the inset.  
To investigate the effect of tilted angle for the 3D titanium PC, we use the grazing incidence objective in the FTIR 
spectrometer. The angle of incident beam is from 52.2° to 84.2° at a time. Fig. 6 shows the measured results of 
grazing-angle incidence. It can be seen that the reflection decreases for polarized and unpolarized light, especially for 
p-polarization. The band edge for the unpolarization case is slightly shifted to a longer wavelength in such large tilted 
angles of incident light. For s-polarization, the reflectance keeps 0.5 at wavelengths ＞ 8 　m and goes down to a very 
low value at a wavelength of 1.5 　m. On the other hand, the reflectance is lower than 0.2 in the measured wavelength 
range for p-polarization, and no clear band edge is observed. This may be attributed to layer number dependence on the 
PBG of the four-layer titanium PC. A unit cell of FCT lattice is only sufficient for supporting a PBG of p-polarization in 
the stacking direction of a 3D PC. For providing the forbidden bands in other symmetrical directions of a 3D lattice, 
increasing the layer number of titanium rods is necessary to constitute a more complete FCT lattice.

4. CONCLUSION 
In summary, the 3D titanium PCs with 100-nm feature sizes have been fabricated with the mature IC technology. The 
PBG effect of PCs is examined by measurement of reflectance spectra at normal and grazing incidence, and these 
measured results are verified by the 3D FDTD method. For the stacking direction of the 3D PC, the band edge locates at 
a wavelength of 5 　m. It is found that the optical behavior of p-polarized light in 3D titanium PCs dominates the range 
of complete band gap. Furthermore, the thermal emission spectra of the 3D titanium PC are measured at different 
temperatures. The emission peak at a wavelength of 3.5 　m with a FWHM of 1.2 　m is observed.

Abstract 
This paper presents a computational intelligence technique, genetic algorithms (GAs), to automatically extract a set 
of optimal electrical and structural parameters for the integrated electron-optic systems. A tool combines the GAs, as 
the optimizer, and a ray-tracing modeling, as the simulator, has been developed, ensuring us to numerically optimize 
versatile electron-optic systems for obtaining the optimum electron optical properties. In this paper, a representative 
design example, the novel electron-beam lithography system is considered. From the reported results, we show that our 
design tool is very robust and well applicable for the optimization-design of electron-optic systems in vacuum micro- 
and nano-electronic applications. 
Introduction 
In the nano-electronic era, electron-optic system has played a vital role in a wide range of vacuum micro- and 
nano-electronic applications, such as the electron microscopy and inspection equipment1-3, novel parallel electron beam 
lithography4-5, field-emission displays (FEDs)6-10, X-ray source and accelerator physics, among others. Typically, many 
electron-optic applications are sophisticated and integrated systems comprising a number of electric, magnetic and 
structural parameters. In this paper, we use an effective global optimization method, genetic algorithms (GAs) to 
automatically extract a set of optimal electrical and structural parameters for the electron-optic systems. GAs is one of 
computational intelligence technique with the idea comes from the Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution - natural 
selection or survival of the fittest. Since GAs is a directed and adaptive search method, it is most suitable for the 
electron-optic optimization problems, especially for designs with large parameter space2,4-5. We take the novel parallel 
nanolithography system6-7, which can be considered as a multiple lenses electron-optic system, to verify GAs’ global 
search ability and robustness. Our purpose is to optimize the e-beam focusability by GAs.  
Parallel Electron Beam Lithography System 
Very recently, field-emission array (FEA) has been widely used for the realization of directed-write 
nanolithography4-5 and flat panel display6-10. In these applications, each element of FEA consists of a sub-micron field 
emitter, which is located at the center of the extraction gate. When the extraction gate is biased to a large enough 
positive voltage with respect to the emitter, electrons are first emitted from the surface of field emitter to vacuum 
through Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and then are accelerated to the anode plane. However, the most critical design 
issue is how to suppress the beam divergence, which imposes the limitation on the available resolution of e-beam on the 
anode plane (image plane). To enhance the e-beam focusability, one6-7,9 or several4-5 focusing gates, serving as the 
electrostatic lens, are coaxially and vertically integrated on the top of the extraction gate (see Fig. 1) and separated by 
the dielectric (SiO2 with εox=3.9), in order to focus the e-beam. In such an integrated system, the electrons may be traced 
through the focusing, acceleration, and deflection field generated by the electrostatic lens and then arrive at the anode 
plane. The beam diameter at the anode plane is desired to be as smaller as possible, which in turn gives a higher e-beam 
resolution. To this end, one has to simultaneously adjust the position and biased voltage of the multiple lenses system.  
As mentioned above, how to determine structural and electrical parameters of the electron-optic system for 
obtaining the optimal electron optical properties is an important subject. Take the pentode-gate FEA shown in Fig. 1 for 
example, the e-beam trajectories are dependent on the position and bias voltage of the focusing gates, which can be 
impossible to optimize all parameters simultaneously and land the results in the global minimum by the traditional 
optimization methods based on mathematical algorithms, such as the gradient-based method and Powell method. 
Therefore, these methods will not be considered in this paper. It is believed that GAs is particularly suitable to 
multi-dimensional overall problems, where the search space potentially contains multiple local minima. In the following, 
we will briefly describe the implementation of GAs.  
GAs-optimization process is illustrated in Fig. 2. In GAs, each unknown parameter to be extracted is regarded as 
a “gene,” which is a floating-point number that are directly generated:  
 Pi = Pmin +λ× (Pmax - Pmin); λ∈  {0,1}  (4) where Pi represents the ith parameter to be extracted, Pmax 
and Pmin are the initial setting of the range of adjustable parameters (see table 1). Take the PG-FEA for example, there 
are eight genes, which are associated to its number of parameter vectors (h1,h2,h3,h4,V1,V2,V3,V4); all genes are 
embedded on the “chromosome,” which is the basic entity GAs’ evolution process, also called an individual. At the 
starting of GAs, Nc (Nc = 80 here) individuals are randomly generated according to equation (4) to form the initial 
population. Each individual is then assigned a fitness value that provides an indication of solutions which are most 
probable to evolve towards a better next generation. Here fitness value, F, is defined as the e-beam diameter, De-beam, at 
the anode plane, which is evaluated by the ray-tracing modeling. We notice that the emitted electrons should not hit the 
gate electrodes. This will generate backscatter electrons, which may infiltrate to the dielectric surface and induced the 
charging, micro-discharges and arcing. In the conditions of max(De-beam) > 1500nm or electron trajectories have touched 
one of the gate electrodes, the fitness value is set to 1500. Based on the fitness values, the next generation is produced 
by the “reproduction” process utilizing the biologically analogous operators of selection (S), crossover (C), and 
mutation (M). In these steps, we define Gk and Gk+1 as the current and the next generations, respectively.  
In Selection (S), a pair of individuals is selected from the current generation for mating. Here, the 
tournament-selection strategy is used, four individuals are randomly chosen and the best two individuals are selected as 
the “parents.” Therefore, individual having better fitness values are more likely to be reproduced. 
In Crossover (C), the parent will interchange their gene material, with a crossover probability Pc = 0.8, to create a 
new pair of individuals called the “children” for the used of the next generation. Here, the intermediate-crossover 
strategy is used, in which the children are created by a weighted average of the parents:  
Pchild = Pparent,1 + λ × (Pparent,2 – Pparent,1);  λ∈  {0,1}   (5) In Mutation (M), mutation is also necessary to maintain the 
diversity in the population and explore the solutions which are not yet present, thus preventing the results to be trapped 
in the local minimum. Here, we use an adaptive mutation, in which each gene is possibly to be replaced by an arbitrary 
number with the mutation probability Pm= 0.1:       
 Pchild’ = min( max( N(Pchild , σ) , Pmin ) )     (6) where σ is the step size:

          (7) 
where N is the number of current generation. 
Therefore, the value of σ is time dependent and decrease with time until σ = 0.1 is achieved. In such a manner, the 
mutation is stronger at the beginning of an optimization to support the sampling of the search space and comes to be 
smaller displacements towards the end, which can aid in fine tuning optimum values with the way analogous to the 
local search method.   
Additionally, the gradient local searches12-13 with initial guess values based on GAs’ results in table 2 are 
performed for each case. The GAs + local search results are summarized in Table 3. The optimized e-beam diameters 
for DG-, TG-, QG-, and PG-FEA are found to be improved to 58.618nm, 45.394nm, 43.389nm, and 38.218nm, 
respectively. As compared to the results found by GAs, the e-beam diameter of each FEA type has just been slightly 
improved (less than 3.67 %). “This further confirms that our GAs can guarantee to find a set of parameters that land the 
results in the global optimum of the solution space.”  
In brief summary, the GAs can give several advantages as compared to the traditional gradient-based local search 
methods: (1) GAs is a global optimization method. Through directed and adaptive search, the GA-optimized results 
may not be trapped in the local minimum, especially when the number of variables increases, (2) the population-based 
and parallel search nature of GAs offers a straightforward approach for parallelism. Through distributed computing 
technique, the computing time can be highly reduced and it will be linearly speeded up with increasing the number of 
processors.  
In many practical applications, the electron-optic systems are more sophisticated, usually involving both electric 
and magnetic force, thus more parameters are needed to be optimized simultaneously (i.e., multiple lenses, 
beam-splitters, mirrors and E×B filters). In these cases, GA will be very useful for the initial design and optimization 
work.  
Conclusions 
We have demonstrated that GAs can work well in the automatic extraction of a set of optimal parameters for the 
ion-optic systems. Furthermore, combining GA with the local search optimization method, the results can be slightly 
improved. “The minor improvement also confirms that the GA-optimized results have been exactly landed in the global 
optimum region.” We notice that this minor improvement can be achieved by increasing the population size or number 
of generation in GAs. Our GA-based design methodology will significantly benefit the initial design work of ion- and 
electron-optic system in the semiconductor manufacturing and nanotechnology industries.

Nano Au metallic wire array is the structure of potential negative permittivity and plasmonic behavior, 
which is very useful to sense and detect the bio-molecular. It is interesting in sensing the Ferritin 
molecular by using this Au WA. Not only can show the better detectivity on bio- sensing with surface 
plasma resonance, but it is also possible to demonstrate the meta-material behavior under combining 
negative and the magnetic properties of Ferrritin. Thus, we utilized e-beam lithography, Au evaporation 
and lift-off techniques to fabricate Au metallic nanopatterns on glass substrate. The dimensions in length, 
width and height of this metal wire are 500 nm, 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The x-direction and 
y-direction intervals between two metal wires are varied among 300 nm, 400 nm, and 500 nm, 
respectively. The transmission measurements were taken by using the BRUKER Micro-FTIR 
Spectroscopy among near-infrared and mid-infrared regime. The resonant positions will depend on the 
intervals distance. We can find out the x-direction and y-direction intervals between two metal increase 
100 nm, the dips of the transmission spectrum will shift 55~60 nm. When the dielectric around the Au 
metallic wire array changes the dip of the transmission spectrum will also change. In order to understand 
the effects caused by different substances and concentrations, we add three kinds of substances (BS-DNA, 
Apo Ferritin, Ferritin) with three kinds of concentration in each. We analyze the wavelength departure of 
the dip caused by different substances and concentrations at several of Au metallic wire array patterns.

1. A parallel Genetic-Algorithm Optimization for Electron-Optic 
Applications

described as: traj(x,y,z) = traj(h1,h2,h3,h4,V1,V2,V3,V4). The variables to be optimized form a parameter vector in an 
optimization problem; all possible parameter vectors (h1,h2,…,hn; V1,V2,…,Vn) constitute a multidimensional search 
space. The ranges of adjustable parameters (search areas) for each parameter vector are summarized in table 1. We 
notice that the search areas should be carefully chosen in order to avoid the electrical breakdown and the arc problem 
between two gate electrodes. The fixed parameters in this study are: 0.5 µm and 1.5 µm for the extraction gate (rg) and 
focusing gate (rf), respectively; 0.1 µm for the thickness of the gate electrodes (t); 0.6 µm and 20 µm for the 
extraction-gate-to-cathode (hg) and anode-to-cathode (d) distance, respectively; 0 V, 75 V, and 300 V for the voltage 
applied on the grounded cathode and field emitter, extraction gate (Vg), and anode (Va), respectively. In this case, a 
single carbon fiber (CF) is used to serve as the field emitter4-5, 8-10. The CF emitter is modeled as a cylinder with a dome 
cap; the length (hCNT) and radius (RCNT) of the cylinder are 0.6 µm and 20 nm, respectively.  
To calculate the electron trajectories, we have developed a theoretical ray-tracing modeling for a 2-D case. In the 
absence of charges, the electric potential satisfies Laplacian equation as: 
02

2
2 =∂
∂+∂
∂=∇
yx
φφφ
            (1) 
where φ  is the electric potential. The Laplacian equation is solved using the finite-different method2-3,8, thus the 
distribution of theta created by electrode at fixed potential can be found numerically. In this case, we limit our 
simulation to a single unit cell of FEA with periodic boundaries. After calculating the potential distribution, the electric 
field distribution can be derived by numerically differentiating the potential with respect to the Cartesian 
coordinates, E
r=∇− φ . The electron trajectories are then governed by the equation of motion (Lorentz equation):

rrrrr ×+==
 
))x(Bv)x(E(q
dt
vdm)v,x(F
rrrrr ×+==
 (2) where q and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively. 
Due to the absence of the magnetic field, equation (2) can be reduced to:

⎛= φ2

.      (3) 
After first solving the equation (1), the electron trajectories are calculated by using the 4th order Runge-Kutta 
method14 for time integration. The typical simulated electron trajectories are shown in Fig. 1(b) (the parameters used 
here are randomly chosen from the corresponding search areas (see table 1). With this ray-tracing modeling, we can 
estimate the e-beam focusability of electron-optic systems with different parameter sets. In this study, the 
GAs-optimization will be performed for the double-gate (DG), triple-gate (TG), quadruple-gate (QG), and pentode-gate 
(PG) FEA for making a detail comparison. 
Genetic Algorithm Optimization 
GAs is a powerful and attractive global optimization method proposed by Holland and his colleagues15 and has 
been applied to several electromagnetic optimization, such as the functional antennas16-17 and photonic crystals18. Here, 
we intend to introduce GAs to the field of electron-optic. For problems involving large search space, it is almost 
Here we also used the elitist strategy, in which the top 5% chromosomes defined as the “elite chromosomes” from 
the preceding generation are preserved and directly inserted into the new generation. This procedure ensures the “elite” 
of each generation can survive more often than the non-elite ones to be used as the parents in the next generation.   
These processes, including selection, crossover, and mutation are repeated until the size of the new generation is 
the same as the current generation. The relationship of the next generation and current generation can be described as 
(Gk+1 = M{C{S{Gk}}}). GAs processes are iterated until Ng (Ng = 60 here) generations are calculated and the best 
chromosome are saved.  
In this case, 4800 runs of ray-tracing simulation are needed for 80 chromosomes evolving over 60 generations. To 
reduce the computational time to an acceptable level, a parallel scheme to GAs is used to accelerate the evolution. 
Taking advantage of the inherent parallelism of GAs, it is possible to use the distributed computing in the fitness 
evaluation. In the distributed computing, Nc chromosomes in each generation are equally assigned to eight processors 
(CPU nodes) of a PC-cluster, resulting in Nc/8 chromosomes having to be treated in each processor. Thus, the fitness 
evaluations are computed in a parallel form and then are gathered by the master processor and the reproduction process 
begins. In such a manner, the computing rate will be speeded up linearly with the increasing of the number of 
processors. GAs is written in open-source program, Python, and a computer intelligence technique optimization 
platform, CITO lab, written in Python has been developed for the intercommunication between the optimizer and the 
simulator. In each generation, the individuals ever appear in the GAs processes and the associated fitness values are 
automatically saved to the database in the CITO lab. Hence, the fitness of the same gene reappears in the subsequent 
generations will not be recalculated and the computing time can be reduced.  
Results and Discussions 
After GAs-optimization, the optimized design parameters and the corresponding e-beam diameter for DG-, TG-, 
QG- and PG-FEA are summarized in table 2. Fig. 2(a) shows the best and average progress of the GAs-optimization for 
PG-FEA as a function of the number of generations. It is seen that a good evolution behavior is presented and the value 
of the best individual eventually converges to a minimum (we notice that the average values in the former generation 
are cut because the values are too high). Upon completion of the GAs, the globally optimized solution of the PG-FEA 
yields an e-beam diameter of 38.74 nm. The corresponding beam shape for the best individual is shown in Fig. 2(b), as 
compared to that in Fig. 1(b) (arbitrarily generated parameters are used) the over-focusing effect has been eliminated 
and a well focused beam shape is presented using the GA-optimized parameters. The optimized e-beam diameters for 
DG-, TG-, QG-, and PG-FEA are 58.982nm, 46.846nm, 45.041nm, and 38.741nm, respectively. It is easily found that 
PG-FEA possesses the smallest e-beam diameter. The e-beam diameter decreases, almost linearly, with increasing 
number of focusing gates. This can be attributed to the increase in design flexibility (more adjustable parameters are 
available to tune the beam shape) when the number of focusing gates in the multiple lenses system increases. Moreover, 
the extracted parameters for each FEA type do not follow the same rule in finding the best e-beam focusability. This is 
because GAs is a parallel and adaptive search method and will independently search the unique optimum in the 
parameter space for each specific problem. This makes GAs a unique optimization method for problems with many 
variables. In addition, it can find that too high or low applied voltages (gate height) are not preferred in all cases; this 
confirms that our search space is large enough to cover all possibilities of finding a global optimum.
