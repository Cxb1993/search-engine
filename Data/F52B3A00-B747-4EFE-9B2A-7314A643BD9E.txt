Abstract 
    This research is focused on the experimental study of the structural strength of cold-formed 
steel wall frames with sheathing under monotonic shear loading. Two aspect ratios, 1.0 and 2.0 
were utilized in the design of wall specimens. Three different kinds of sheathing material, 
gypsum board, calcium silicate board, and oriented-strand board, with two different thicknesses 
(9 mm and 12 mm) were adopted in the test specimens. The strain gages were also used to attach 
the wall specimen to study the stress distribution during the test. The ultimate strength, stiffness, 
energy absorption, and ductility ratio were studied for each test specimen. In addition, the 
sheathing material tests such as elastic modulus and shear modulus were conducted to obtain the 
relative parameters. It was observed that the ultimate strength of the wall frame with sheathing 
is much greater than the strength of the wall frame without sheathing material. And the ultimate 
strength of wall frame with sheathing increases with increasing the thickness of board. The 
ultimate strengths of specimens with 12 mm-thick boards are about 9.11% greater than those of 
specimens with 9 mm-thick boards for the wall frames having aspect ratio of 1.0 and with 
one-side sheathing only. The ultimate strengths of specimens with two-side sheathing are about 
45.40% greater than those of specimens with one-side sheathing for the wall frames having aspect 
ratio of 1.0. And the ultimate strengths of specimens having aspect ratio of 1.0 are about 65.44% 
greater than those of specimens having aspect ratio of 2.0 for the wall frames with the same 
sheathing configuration. In final, the ductility ratios of the cold-formed steel wall frames similar 
to the wall configuration conducted in this study are proposed.

 columns. These stainless steel structures are sometimes the preferred choice due 
to their superior corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, ease of maintenance 
and high strength. In the United States, ASCE Standard Specification, 
SEI/ASCE 8-02 (ASCE, 2002), can be used for the design of cold-formed 
stainless steel compression members. Because of the difference in mechanical 
behavior as shown in Fig. 1, the design of stainless steel columns is more 
complicated than those of carbon steels (ASCE, 1991). Stainless steels also have 
gradually yielding type of stress-strain curves with relatively low proportional 
limits (Johnson et al., 1969; Yu, 2000). Due to the nonlinear stress-strain 
behavior, the design of such compression members has long been followed by 
using the tangent modulus theory (Johnston, 1976; Galambos, 1968). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Stress-Strain Curves of Carbon and Stainless Steels 
 
Tangent modulus is used to account for the inelastic buckling of stainless 
steel compression components. It can be determined by using the modified 
Ramberg-Osgood equation (Ramberg et al., 1943; Hill, 1944) for specified types 
of stainless steels. Because of the nonlinear nature of tangent modulus, the 
column buckling stress is determined through an iterative process until the 
satisfied tolerance is reached. Previous research studies discussed different 
methods to deal with the nonlinear calculations (Rasmussen et al., 2000; 
Rasmussen et al. 1997). This type of calculation is often tedious and 
time-consuming as compared with that of hot-rolled steel column design.

in which Eo is the initial modulus of elasticity and n is the coefficient used for 
determining tangent modulus of specified type of stainless steel. Table 2 gives 
values of Eo and n for austenitic type stainless steels as specified in the ASCE 
Standard.  
 
Because of the correlation between the buckling stress and tangent modulus 
in Eq. (2), an assumed buckling stress Fn is needed to determine the value of Et. 
Then, this calculated value of Et is substituted into Eq. (1) to determine the 
buckling stress, Fn. Since the calculated buckling stress is seldom equal to the 
first assumed buckling stress, further successive iterations are required to obtain 
the true buckling stress. Though the process is tedious and time-consuming, this 
buckling stress can be achieved when the satisfied convergence of iteration is 
reached.

Development of Mathematical Formulation 
 
A simplified approach was developed to determine the flexural buckling 
stress without using iterative process. The tangent modulus value obtained from 
the modified Ramberg-Osgood equation was used to generate the simplified 
design equation. Numerical approximation by using Taylor series expansion is 
applied to simplify the calculations.

Comparisons of Results 
 
Comparisons are made between the predicted buckling stresses computed 
from the ASCE Standard design equations and the proposed design formulas. 
This paper summarizes the result of comparison. Type 304 stainless steel 
columns are used to compare the predicted flexural buckling stresses. The 
specified material properties used to determine the buckling stress for ASCE 
Standard are given in Table 2. The design parameters for the same materials 
determined from the proposed design equations are listed in Table 3. For this 
type of stainless steel, the computed buckling stresses, Fn,ASCE and Fn,prop, and the 
ratios of Fn,prop/Fn,ASCE with respect to the slenderness ratios, KL/r, in 
longitudinal compression are given in Table 4. In this table, Fn,ASCE and Fn,prop are 
predicted flexural buckling stresses determined from the ASCE Standard and 
proposed design equations, respectively. This comparison is also illustrated in 
Fig. 4. It is shown that the proposed design equations, without having iterative 
calculations, can predict good results as compared with the ASCE Standard 
results.  
 
Conclusions 
  
The buckling stress of cold-formed stainless steel compression members is 
determined on the basis of the tangent modulus theory because of the nonlinear 
stress strain behavior of the materials. The determination of flexural buckling 
stress needs iterative process which is often tedious and time-consuming for a 
typical column design. In order to simplify the design calculation, mathematical 
approximations are utilized to calculate flexural buckling stress which needs 
non-iterative process. This paper discusses the reasoning behind for the 
development of the simplified formulas. Comparisons are made between the 
predicted column flexural buckling stresses determined from the ASCE design 
formulas and the proposed design equations. It is shown that the flexural

columns. These stainless steel structures are sometimes the preferred choice due 
to their superior corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, ease of maintenance 
and high strength. In the United States, ASCE Standard Specification, 
SEI/ASCE 8-02 (ASCE, 2002), can be used for the design of cold-formed 
stainless steel compression members. Because of the difference in mechanical 
behavior as shown in Fig. 1, the design of stainless steel columns is more 
complicated than those of carbon steels (ASCE, 1991). Stainless steels also have 
gradually yielding type of stress-strain curves with relatively low proportional 
limits (Johnson et al., 1969; Yu, 2000). Due to the nonlinear stress-strain 
behavior, the design of such compression members has long been followed by 
using the tangent modulus theory (Johnston, 1976; Galambos, 1968). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Stress-Strain Curves of Carbon and Stainless Steels 
 
Tangent modulus is used to account for the inelastic buckling of stainless 
steel compression components. It can be determined by using the modified 
Ramberg-Osgood equation (Ramberg et al., 1943; Hill, 1944) for specified types 
of stainless steels. Because of the nonlinear nature of tangent modulus, the 
column buckling stress is determined through an iterative process until the 
satisfied tolerance is reached. Previous research studies discussed different 
methods to deal with the nonlinear calculations (Rasmussen et al., 2000; 
Rasmussen et al. 1997). This type of calculation is often tedious and 
time-consuming as compared with that of hot-rolled steel column design.

in which Eo is the initial modulus of elasticity and n is the coefficient used for 
determining tangent modulus of specified type of stainless steel. Table 2 gives 
values of Eo and n for austenitic type stainless steels as specified in the ASCE 
Standard.  
 
Because of the correlation between the buckling stress and tangent modulus 
in Eq. (2), an assumed buckling stress Fn is needed to determine the value of Et. 
Then, this calculated value of Et is substituted into Eq. (1) to determine the 
buckling stress, Fn. Since the calculated buckling stress is seldom equal to the 
first assumed buckling stress, further successive iterations are required to obtain 
the true buckling stress. Though the process is tedious and time-consuming, this 
buckling stress can be achieved when the satisfied convergence of iteration is 
reached.

Development of Mathematical Formulation 
 
A simplified approach was developed to determine the flexural buckling 
stress without using iterative process. The tangent modulus value obtained from 
the modified Ramberg-Osgood equation was used to generate the simplified 
design equation. Numerical approximation by using Taylor series expansion is 
applied to simplify the calculations.

Comparisons of Results 
 
Comparisons are made between the predicted buckling stresses computed 
from the ASCE Standard design equations and the proposed design formulas. 
This paper summarizes the result of comparison. Type 304 stainless steel 
columns are used to compare the predicted flexural buckling stresses. The 
specified material properties used to determine the buckling stress for ASCE 
Standard are given in Table 2. The design parameters for the same materials 
determined from the proposed design equations are listed in Table 3. For this 
type of stainless steel, the computed buckling stresses, Fn,ASCE and Fn,prop, and the 
ratios of Fn,prop/Fn,ASCE with respect to the slenderness ratios, KL/r, in 
longitudinal compression are given in Table 4. In this table, Fn,ASCE and Fn,prop are 
predicted flexural buckling stresses determined from the ASCE Standard and 
proposed design equations, respectively. This comparison is also illustrated in 
Fig. 4. It is shown that the proposed design equations, without having iterative 
calculations, can predict good results as compared with the ASCE Standard 
results.  
 
Conclusions 
  
The buckling stress of cold-formed stainless steel compression members is 
determined on the basis of the tangent modulus theory because of the nonlinear 
stress strain behavior of the materials. The determination of flexural buckling 
stress needs iterative process which is often tedious and time-consuming for a 
typical column design. In order to simplify the design calculation, mathematical 
approximations are utilized to calculate flexural buckling stress which needs 
non-iterative process. This paper discusses the reasoning behind for the 
development of the simplified formulas. Comparisons are made between the 
predicted column flexural buckling stresses determined from the ASCE design 
formulas and the proposed design equations. It is shown that the flexural

The feature of scaffolding system includes the single-row assembly model 
with cross-brace removed at the side nearer to the façade of a building. 
    In construction, wall scaffolds provide a good working platform for 
workers for assembling and disassembling of formworks and stuccoing 
works, etc.  According to a recent survey of construction sites, it was found 
that the anchor rods connecting scaffolds and façade of buildings do not 
have a proper installed method.  The grade 3 rebar of diameter equal to 3/8 
in, 0.9525 cm and nominal design strength 275 N/mm2, is substituted for the 
patent anchor rod in construction sites.  Furthermore, during stuccoing and 
finishing process of buildings, anchor rods are even frequently removed for 
the purpose of working convenience. 
    The wall scaffold needs to be paved with plank for working operation.  
Since the wall scaffold is installed in a single row for the convenient setting 
of formwork or finishing works for facades so that the lateral side adjacent 
to the constructing building has no cross-brace in the construction stage as 
shown in Fig. 1.  The set plank should be able to enhance the critical load 
of a scaffolding system and strengthen the weak point of having no 
cross-brace as well.  This scale of its enhancement should be studied. 
    Previous study by Godley and Beale (1997) indicated that the behavior 
of system scaffolds involved the windward standard to uplift forces relative 
to the horizontal load.  Peng et al. (2008) revealed the effect of simple 
eccentric loads to the scaffolding systems without considering the plank and 
anchor rod.  Most research on scaffolds (Peng et al. 2001, Yu 2004, 
Weesner et al. 2001) involved the strengths of shoring systems.  These 
studies were not related to the scaffolding systems for finishing works. 
    This research investigates the critical loads of scaffolding systems 
under concentric and eccentric loads for probing into the effect of use of the 
anchor rod and the plank.  The type of research mainly emphasizes on the 
test and analysis.  The outlines of this research can be classified as the 
following five categories: (A) the structural behavior of the basic setup 
scaffold, (B) the effect of anchor rod to the critical load, (C) the effect of 
plank to the critical load, (D) the effect of both anchor rod and plank to the 
critical load, (E) the effect of inner knee brace to the failure model. 
    The analysis presented in this study is based on a three-dimensional 
second-order elastic analysis using semi-rigid joint.  The analysis software 
adopted here is GMNAF program developed by Chan (1988).  For 
simulating the initial imperfection of the scaffolding system, the notional 
lateral force is applied to the structure in the analysis.  This lateral notional 
force is approximated as 0.1~0.5% of the factored gravitational load. 
 
2. Material Properties 
    The type of the tested scaffold used in this research is the door-shape 
steel-pipe scaffold with inner diagonally reinforced bracing bars, i.e. knee 
braces, shown in Fig. 2.  The sectional dimensions of the scaffolding 
 18
placed at the position (d/2, 3L/4) of the xy coordinate.  L/4 eccentric load 
is located at (d/4, L/2) of xy coordinate shown in Fig. 5(III).  In TL/4 
eccentric loading test, the load was applied at asymmetric location along 
upper & lower and left & right directions, i.e. at the location (d/4, 3L/4) of 
xy coordinate shown in Fig. 5 (IV).  All of the 4 types of eccentric loading 
tests are separately processed with the two types of erection as single-side 
cross-brace with the removal of cross-brace at the access location. 
 
4. Discussions of Test and Analysis 
4.1 Structural Behavior of Basic Setup Scaffold 
    The basic setup scaffold is defined as the restrained boundary with no 
lateral displacement and under a concentric load.  The critical load of the 
basic setup scaffold is considered as a basis for comparison with the other 
scaffolding cases.  The averaged critical load of the 2-story scaffold with 
cross-brace at both sides is 117.7 kN.  The averaged critical load for the 
2-story scaffold with only one single-side cross-brace is 102.9 kN.  The 
averaged critical load for the 3-story scaffold with cross-brace at both sides 
is 104.1 kN.  The averaged critical load for the 3-story scaffold with 
cross-brace at only single side is 70.2 kN.  From the aforementioned test 
result of basic scaffolds, it is found that the second or repeated loading test 
results of the four groups are reduced for more than 40%.  Therefore, it is 
known that the effect of the variation between brand new and worst used 
and old scaffolds to their critical load is enormous. 
 
4.2 Effect of Anchor Rod 
    The tests in this research adopt a No. 3 rebar as an anchor rod to 
connect scaffolds.  Two types of connections are respectively 45 and 90 
degrees to the scaffold.  As shown in Fig. 5(I), the angle of the anchor rod 
is defined as 90 degrees.  Due to the feature of temporary accessory, 
anchor rods in construction sites are frequently connected in a slight 
inclination.  As it is taken as 45-degree connection in this research, it is 
deemed as the worst connection.  The 90-degree connection is the standard 
connection angle and is deemed to be the best connection of the anchor rod. 
    During the test, the applied loads are the concentric load and the TL/4 
eccentric load.  It is intended to check the effectiveness of anchor rod to 
critical load of the scaffold under the eccentric loading condition.  The 
2-story scaffold is tested with the cross-brace of the lowest story of scaffold 
removed. 
 
4.2.1 Test Result

    The test without anchor rod is carried out for comparing with the 
strength of scaffolding structure with anchor rod and plank.  Owing to

system with removal of cross-brace at access location as Type (1), and (2) 
the scaffolding system with only single-side cross-brace as Type (2). 
    As Type (1) has its bottom story cross-brace removed, its critical load 
is rather low.  The averaged critical load is 18.1 kN.  The averaged critical 
load of the Type (2) scaffolding system with single-side cross-brace is 32 kN.  
Compared with the concentric load condition, the critical load of Type (2) is 
reduced by approximately half as 0.51(=18.1/35.7) and 0.52 (=32/62), 
respectively.  It indicates that the joint of the scaffolding system under 
TL/4 eccentric load generates a greater extent of damage, which greatly 
reduces the critical load of the scaffold. 
 
• 45 Degree Anchor Rod [Type (1)] 
    This research adopts TL/4 eccentric load in simulating the worst 
eccentric load condition of the scaffolding system in construction sites.  
The system is a 2-story scaffold with the removal of cross-brace at access 
location.  The anchor rod is applied with inclination θ equal to 45 degree 
connecting the scaffold as shown in Fig. 5(I).  The test result indicates the 
critical load as 32.9 kN 
    The averaged critical load of the scaffolding system having 45 degree 
erection of anchor rod is 32.9 kN.  Compared with the critical load of 44.3 
kN with 45 degree anchor rod scaffold under concentric load, the critical 
load of 32.9 kN is rather low.  The ratio of the two is about 0.74 
(=32.9/44.3).  However, it is quite close to the critical load 35.7 kN of the 
scaffolding system without anchor rod and under concentric load.  This 
indicates that after the scaffold is fixed with 45 degree anchor, its restraining 
effect drops about 25% when compared with 90 degree connection.  
Nevertheless, when compared with the scaffold without anchor rod and 
under concentric load, the boundary condition can be transformed from 
laterally movable to unmovable conditions making the effect of TL/4 
eccentric load insignificant. 
 
4.2.2 Analysis of Anchor Rod Stiffness 
    The research mainly implements a 2-story scaffolding system where 
the anchor rod is taken as linearly elastic spring providing elastic stiffness as 
ks (=EA/L).  If the anchor rod length taken as L=30 cm and the elasticity 
modulus as E = 20012.4 kN/cm2 (a nominal value of steel) are adopted for 
the analysis, the rebar stiffness is varied by simply changing its 
cross-sectional area A, i.e. changing the rebar diameter. 
    The analysis result is shown in Fig. 7.  When the diameter is increased 
to No. 3 rebar diameter 0.9515 cm, the stiffness of anchor rod ks = 475.1 
kN/cm and the analyzed scaffolding critical load is 89.5 kN as shown in Fig. 
7.  The Figure further indicates that when the anchor rods diameter is 0.2 
cm, i.e. at ks = 21 kN/cm, the analyzed scaffolding critical load is close to 
89.5 kN.  Therefore, it is found that if 30 cm long No. 3 rebar is applied as 
 22
insignificant effect to the critical loads of overall scaffolding systems.  
Under the same loading conditions, the critical loads of the scaffolding 
systems with 2 to 12 stories vary only slightly.  This is quite close to the 
observations in another publication that the scaffolding systems under the 
various eccentric loads without plank (Peng et al. 2008). 
    If the worst condition of the planking end connection is applied, the 
planking end is assumed to connect to the scaffold with the hinged joint.  
In this case, the analysis results are compared with the critical loads of the 
scaffolding systems with and without the plank.  The comparison is shown 
in Fig. 8 using the data from reference (Peng et al. 2008).  Fig. 8 reveals 
that the critical loads of the scaffolding systems concentrated at two regions 
though various eccentric loads are taken into consideration.  The region is 
divided into areas with the plank and without the plank. 
    As shown in Fig. 8 and under concentric loading condition, the 
scaffolding system with plank increases the critical load for 2.7 (=60.9/22.4) 
times.  Under T/4 eccentric loading condition, the critical load is increased 
by 2.6 (=44.9/17.8) times.  Under L/4 eccentric loading condition, the 
critical load is increased by 3.5 (=51.1/14.7) times.  Under TL/4 eccentric 
load condition, the critical load is increased by 3.3 (=40.9/12.3) times.  
From the analysis results shown in Fig. 8, it is found that if a scaffolding 
system is installed with the plank, the critical load of the scaffolding system 
can dramatically increase twice.  The added plank can make up the 
partially lost strength of the scaffolding system when the single-side 
cross-brace is removed.  Therefore, the plank should not be removed from 
the working scaffolding system in construction sites. 
 
4.4 Effect of Both Anchor Rod and Plank 
    This paper analyzes the effect of the simultaneous setup of the plank 
and the anchor rod in scaffolds to the critical load of the scaffolding system.  
In addition to installing the single-side cross-brace and the plank in every 
story, anchor rods are also installed on both sides of every 2-story of the 
scaffolding systems for analysis of scaffold from 2 to 12 stories.  The 
boundary condition is the same as the one in construction site condition.  
Hinged connections are assumed between the anchor rod and the scaffold.  
The connections between the plank and the scaffold remain the same, 
respectively as hinge joint, rigid joint and semi-rigid joint.  Their spiral 
elastic stiffness is 490.5 kN-cm/rad. 
    Fig. 9 shows the analysis results of hinged joint of planking ends under 
different eccentric loads.  From the test results being very close to each 
other in the end stiffnesses, hinged joints, rigid joint and semi-rigid joint, it 
is found that the connection stiffness between the planking end and the 
scaffold has insignificant effect to the critical load of the scaffolding system 
furnished with planks and anchor rods.  This is similar to the analysis 
results of the planked scaffolding system without the anchor rod described 
 24
    If the linear elastic stiffness of the anchor rod varies, the changes of the 
scaffolding system within and without inner knee brace can be studied.  Fig. 
13 indicates a 4-story scaffolding system, when the horizontal elastic 
stiffness of the anchor rod changes to 21 kN/cm, i.e. when a rebar 0.2 cm 
diameter is used, the critical load of the scaffolding system is 89.5 kN and 
that of the portal frame is 52.2 kN.  Also, as shown in Fig. 13, the critical 
loads of the scaffold and portal frame systems do not totally increase in line 
with the increment of the anchor rod stiffness.  The critical loads of two 
systems respectively approach a certain fixed value. 
 
4.5.3 Scaffold with Anchor Rod and Plank in Every Story 
    This paper studies the effect of installing anchor rod in every story to 
the critical load.  The analysis and comparison are made for the scaffold 
and the portal frame system, i.e. scaffold without inner knee brace, from 2 to 
5 stories.  Fig. 14 shows the analysis result of the 4-story systems with the 
anchor rod at every story where all analysis assumptions are the same as 
above, except with the installation of anchor rods.  It is found in Fig. 14 
that, regardless of having inner knee brace or not, the failure mode changes 
from the original in-plane direction to the out-of-plane direction.  Since the 
installation of the anchor rod in every story caused a change in the failure 
mode so that the effective length is reduced.  This makes the critical load 
of the scaffold systems within and without the inner knee brace unrelated to 
the installation height of the scaffolds.  Moreover, the strengths of the two 
systems with the anchor rod in every story are higher than those in scaffold 
with anchor rod placed every 2 stories. 
    Fig. 15 shows the analysis result of scaffolding system within and 
without inner knee braces from 2 to 5 stories.  It is found from Fig. 15 that 
the critical load of the scaffolding system within the inner knee brace with 
every story installed with the anchor rod is 165.5 kN.  Compared with the 
scaffolding system having anchor rods installed in every 2-story, the critical 
load approximately increases by 1.8 (= 165.5/89.5) times.  It is also known 
from the figure that the critical load, 162.9 kN, of the scaffold not using the 
inner knee brace is slightly less than that of the scaffolding system with the 
inner knee brace.  This discrepancy is not like the analysis result for the 
two cases where anchor rods are used in every 2-story of the scaffold. 
 
5. Conclusions 
z Based on this study, the critical load of the 2-story scaffolding system 
can increase by 1.5 times compared with that of scaffolding systems 
without anchor rods.  The anchor rod of No. 3 rebar of 30 cm length is 
assumed in the studies.  If both the No. 3 rebar and the plank are setup, 
the critical load of the scaffolding system can even increase by 4 times.  
While construction works is in progress, the plank and the anchor rod 
should not be removed.
