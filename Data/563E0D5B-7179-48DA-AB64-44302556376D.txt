Maximum-Likelihood Decoding for Nonorthogonal
and Orthogonal Linear Space–Time Block Codes
Hong-Yu Liu and Rainfield Y. Yen
Abstract—It is a general consensus that an orthogonal
space–time block code can achieve full diversity, and due to its
orthogonal nature, the multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO)
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding metrics can be decoupled
into single-input–single-output (SISO) ML metrics based on linear
processing at the receiver, thus greatly reducing the decoding
complexity. In fact, nonorthogonal codes also currently exist that
can achieve better symbol-error-rate performance without rate
reduction and complexity increase for correlated fading channels.
In this paper, we show by detailed derivations that nonorthogonal
linear space–time block codes can also be decoded by ML decou-
pling through receiver linear processing. Our derived expressions
for the decoupled ML metrics automatically contain the design
information for the receiver linear processors.
Index Terms—Antenna diversity, fading channels, linear
space–time block codes (LSTBCs), orthogonal space–time block
codes (OSTBCs).
I. INTRODUCTION
I T IS a general impression that due to the orthogonal struc-ture of the orthogonal space–time block code (OSTBC),
simple maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding based on linear
processing at the receiver can be achieved through decoupling
of transmitted signals [1]–[7]. Moreover, the OSTBC can be
designed to achieve maximum diversity order [5]. Therefore,
it has gained vast popularity. Several codes with a complex
orthogonal design (COD) [5], [8]–[13] and a generalized COD
(GCOD) [5], [14] have been unveiled.
Li et al. [15] then presented a general derivation to de-
couple ML decoding for COD multiple-input–multiple-output
(MIMO) channels into single-input–single-output (SISO) ML
decoding forms. An equivalent proof with more brief deriva-
tion is given in [16]. Later, Xu and Kwak [17] derived the
decoupling of the MIMO ML metric into SISO ML metrics for
GCOD channels.
However, a space–time block code (STBC) can also be
nonorthogonal. As defined in [16], a major category of the
space–time code is the linear STBC (LSTBC) that encompasses
both orthogonal and nonorthogonal codes. An LSTBC becomes
a COD if and only if the code matrices satisfy the amicable
orthogonal design (AOD) [16]. Then, under slightly different
conditions, an LSTBC may become a GCOD code. Recently,

some researchers have developed a nonorthogonal LSTBC by
precoding an OSTBC [18]–[20]. It is shown in [19] that when
fading channels are correlated, nonorthogonal codes resulting
from optimum precoding of the OSTBC can achieve better
symbol-error-rate (SER) performance than the OSTBC. The
SER is the ultimate system performance measure and is more
important than diversity order. In this paper, we introduce a
more general class of LSTBC with code matrix satisfying
conditions broader than those of the AOD. Such an LSTBC
class may generally encompass orthogonal (including GCOD
and COD) and nonorthogonal codes. In fact, the nonorthogonal
codes of [18]–[20] fall into this class of LSTBC. We then
prove, in a more general way than those given in [15] and
[17], which are only for orthogonal codes, that ML decoupling
through receiver linear processing is also feasible for this class
of LSTBC, whether orthogonal or nonorthogonal. Thus, simple
ML decoupling is not a prerogative of only the orthogonal
codes. A by-product of our proof derivation is the revela-
tion of the design structures of the receiver linear processors.
Moreover, some of the codes discussed here may possess the
following properties: 1) that equivalent virtual channel gains
for the real and imaginary parts of signal symbols are unequal
and 2) that the equivalent additive complex Gaussian noise
may be noncircularly symmetric. In short, our contribution
is to introduce and formulate a general class of LSTBC that
encompasses orthogonal and nonorthogonal designs and prove
that nonorthogonal codes can also be decoded through the
decoupling of ML metrics. Furthermore, the simple derived
forms of the decoupled ML metrics automatically contain de-
sign information for the receiver linear processors.
A word is in order here. We have not made available how
to construct the said general class of LSTBC. Whether such
LSTBCs can be constructed remains an open and challenging
subject and, hence, needs to be further investigated. Fortu-
nately, as stated earlier, some LSTBCs that indeed fall into
this class have recently appeared in the literature [18]–[20],
and a nonorthogonal code constructed following the technique
given in [19] is delineated in the numerical example section for
demonstration. Although many nonorthogonal codes have yet
to be discovered (just like many orthogonal codes have yet to
be discovered), it does not mean that they do not exist. Our
theory merely opens a door for a further research challenge.
Section II presents the general class of LSTBC with code
matrix satisfying the broad conditions. Section III proves the
ML decoding capability for this class of LSTBC, whether
orthogonal or nonorthogonal. Then, Section IV explores ML
decoding for various special cases by relaxing the broad condi-
tions. Section V gives an example of the existing nonorthogonal

It is apparent that Rk,1 and Rk,2 are real. Also, Rk,3 is easily
seen to be real due to the fact that x2kcW∗k,1 + x2ksW∗k,2 +
xkcxksW∗k,3 is Hermitian (the Hermitian of a real number is
the real number itself). Thus, the metric DML,k of (14) is real,
as it should be. In light of (13) and (14), we see that although
the code may be nonorthogonal, the ML decoding of (11) can
still be decoupled into M ·K metrics, as given by (14). Thus,
the simple ML decoupling is not the prerogative of the OSTBC.
However, the expression given by (14) is in an awkward form
and, thus, is not convenient for analysis. We thus seek further
refinement.

eigenvalues are simply the equivalent channel gains, which are

∗
k,2hq =
Q∑
q=1
∥∥BTk hq∥∥2 . (32b)
Thus, xkc and xks will experience unequal channel gains. As
remarked in Section III, these gains a2k and b2k are correlated
RVs. The two metrics of (29) become
DML,kc =
(
Rk,1 − a2kxkc
)2 (33a)
DML,ks =
(
Rk,2 − b2kxks
)2
. (33b)
By applying (2)–(9) and (15), (16), and (32) along with Wk,3 =
0 onto (33), we can readily show that the two noise components
Rk,1 − a2kxkc and Rk,2 − b2kxks can be expressed as
nkc =Rk,1 − a2kxkc
=

[
nHq B
T
k hq −
(

. (34b)
We have already shown that for fixed channel realizations, these
two noise components are nonidentical Gaussian RVs with
zero mean and variances σ2kc = a2kσ2n/2 and σ2ks = b2kσ2n/2,
respectively. It should be noted here that although Wk,3 = 0,
we still have a nonorthogonal code if Wk,1 and Wk,2 are not
diagonal matrices.
Case 2: In addition to Wk,3 = 0, if Wk,1 = Wk,2 (this
means a2k = b
2
k but not Rk,1 = Rk,2), we have a circularly
symmetric situation. That is, xkc and xks will experience equal
channel gains, and the equivalent noise is a circularly sym-
metric Gaussian RV [nkc and nks are independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.)]. Again, if Wk,1 and Wk,2 are not diagonal
matrices, the code is nonorthogonal.
Case 3: In addition to Wk,3 = 0, we further let Wk,1 =
Λk,1 and Wk,2 = Λk,2, where Λk,1 and Λk,2 are diagonal
matrices of the following forms:
Λk,1 =


αk1 0 · · · 0


 . (35b)
This will make GGH diagonal. Thus, we have now an orthogo-
nal code. From (18) and (19), we see that both Wk,1 and Wk,2
are positive semidefinite, and hence, Λk,1 and Λk,2 must now
be positive semidefinite. Thus, all αkp and βkp are nonnegative.
In addition
a2k =

. (37b)
Therefore, for this orthogonal code, the real and imaginary
signal components will experience different channel gains. It
can also be readily shown that the equivalent virtual noise will
have the real and imaginary components given by
nkc =Rk,1 − xkc
Q∑
q=1
P∑
p=1
αkp|hp,q|2 (38a)
nks =Rk,2 − xks
Q∑
q=1
P∑
p=1
βkp|hp,q|2. (38b)
Both nck and nsk have zero mean and variances, respectively,
given by
σ2kc =

Q∑

αkp|hp,q|2 (39a)
σ2ks =
σ2n
2
Q∑
q=1
P∑
p=1
βkp|hp,q|2. (39b)
Thus, for this orthogonal code, both noise components nkc and
nks also have different variances and, hence, are not identical.
Case 4: If in Case 3, we let Λk,1 = Λk,2 = Λk, then αkp =
βkp. The metrics for the real and imaginary symbol components
become
DML,kc =
(
Rk,1 − xkc

This is equivalent to an order P ×Q maximal ratio combining
(MRC) system with channel gains {√αkphp,q}. In addition,

Since the matrix in (52) is not diagonal, C is a nonorthogonal
LSTBC. In fact, C belongs to Case 2, as given in Section IV.
However, as analyzed in [19], this nonorthogonal C will yield
a lower SER than the orthogonal G for the same SNR. We will
not repeat here the analysis of SER performance as our main
subject is to prove the ML decoupling capability of the LSTBC.
Next, we want to design the receiver linear processors.

Abstract—It has been recently shown that, for non-orthogonal 
space-time block code (STBC), the multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) maximum-likelihood (ML) metric can also be 
decoupled into single-input single-output (SISO) ML metrics for 
decoding simplification just as for orthogonal STBC. In this 
work, we utilized the decoupled metrics of a non-orthogonal 
STBC to derive the symbol error rate (SER) in correlative 
fading channels and show that, when the non-orthogonal code is 
generated by converting an orthogonal code using proper 
precoding, the conversion will improve the SER performance 
when the MIMO channels are correlated. 
Keywords - space-time block code, MIMO, maximum-
likelihood decoding, corrrelative fading channels 
I. INTRODUCTION 
DUE to the orthogonal structure of the orthogonal STBC, the 
decoding of data symbols can be made simplified by 
decoupling the MIMO ML metric into separate SISO ML 
metrics [1]-[3]. However, recently, it is found that non-
orthogonal STBC can also be decoded by exactly the same 
simple manner [4]. This means decoupled ML decoding is 
not the prerogative of the orthogonal STBC. Both non-
orthogonal and orthogonal STBCs belong to the class of 
linear STBCs [2], [4] and new codes for both are yet to be 
discovered, though more attention has so far been paid to the 
design of orthogonal STBCs [1], [5]-[7]. A non-orthogonal 
STBC may be derived from an orthogonal STBC by proper 
precoding to achieve minimum SER for correlative fading 
communications [8]. Since minimum error rate is the 
ultimate performance measure for data communications, we 
are motivated to investigate the SER performance of non-
orthogonal STBCs so formed for correlative fading channels. 
  In this work, we shall derive symbol error rate (SER) 
expression for a non-orthogonal STBC over correlative 
fading channel models. This non-orthogonal code has been 
given in [8] and falls into a class of linear STBC specified in 
[4]. Comparison will be made between the SER performance 
for an orthogonal STBC and the corresponding non-
orthogonal STBC derived from that orthogonal STBC. We 
will assume QAM signaling over Rayleigh fading channels 
in our SER derivations.  
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II 
briefly reviews the class of linear STBC introduced in [4]. 
Section III derives the SER of a non-orthogonal STBC for 
M-QAM transmission over correlative fading channels. Then, 
Section IV presents numerical examples including 
performance comparisons between orthogonal and non-
orthogonal codes. Finally, Section V draws conclusions.  
 
II. NON-ORTHOGONAL STBC 
We consider a wireless communication system with P 
transmit antennas and Q receive antennas employing linear 
STBC transmission. Let the equivalent baseband path gain 
from the pth transmit antenna to qth receive antenna be qph , , 
Pp ,...,2,1= , Qq ,...,2,1= . 
A linear STBC transmission can be described by a NP×  
code matrix as [2]

 is no more diagonal. The SER vs. 
average received SNR performance for square 16-QAM over 
correlative Rayleigh fading channels using the above data is 
presented in Fig. 1. Theoretical curves using (15) and Monte 
Carlo simulated curves are both given. It is seen that 
theoretical results are in excellent agreement with Monte 
Carlo simulated results. Note that small correlation yields 
better performance resulting from larger diversity. Then, Fig. 
2 presents the comparisons between the SER curves for the 
orthogonal code of (18) and the corresponding non-
orthogonal code for 6.0=ρ  and 9.0=ρ . Clearly, we see 
that the non-orthogonal code outperforms the orthogonal 
counterpart.  
 
V. CONCLUSION 
  We derive the SER for a non-orthogonal STBC coupled 
with QAM signaling in correlative fading channels. The non-
orthogonal code is formed by precoding an orthogonal STBC 
using optimum power loading. MIMO ML metric decoupling 
into SISO metrics is still applicable to the non-orthogonal 
code. Simulation results of SER performances for a code 
example in excellent agreements with theoretical results 
show that non-orthogonal codes outperform the orthogonal 
counterparts when MIMO channels are correlated.
