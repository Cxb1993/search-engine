chamber of rabbit eyes has been used for 
repopulation of the damaged corneal 
endothelium, but the transplantation method has 
a major drawback such as difficult control of the 
distribution and size of cell grafts [3]. 
Additionally, cells in suspension undergo 
apoptosis due to their lower ocular immune 
privileged properties relative to cells in 
well-organized sheets. 
Along with the rapid advance in tissue 
engineering, several biomaterials such as gelatin, 
collagen-coated dextran, Descemet’s membrane, 
poly-L-lysine/fibronectin-coated methyl 
methacrylate/N-vinyl pyrrolidone copolymer, 
amniotic membrane, and collagen have been 
investigated for CEC cultivation and 
transplantation [4]. However, the permanent 
residence of culture substrate materials in the 
body may cause the poor graft-host integration 
and high risk of foreign body reaction. In order 
to overcome the problems associated with 
traditional tissue engineering approaches, we, as 
others, have presented a technique to fabricate 
bioengineered human CEC sheets on 
thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) 
(PNIPAAm)-based culture supports [5,6]. 
Without the use of biomaterial substrates, the 
thermally detached cell sheets with proper 
structure and function can feasibly be used as 
tissue equivalents for replacing compromised 
corneal endothelium [7]. It is known that the 
anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid 
(i.e., aqueous humor), which leads to unstable 
attachment of donor cell/tissue grafts onto 
corneal posterior surfaces. To deliver and retain 
the transplants at the site of injury is essential 
for achieving high tissue regeneration efficiency. 
In the author’s previous work, the bioadhesive 
gelatin discs were developed as temporary 
carriers for delivery of CEC sheets [8]. 
Although the application of gelatin-CEC 
sheet constructs partially restores corneal clarity 
in a xenogeneic model [4], the gelatin discs with 
dense structure in the anterior chamber may 
interrupt the transport of nutrients and upset the 
balance of intraocular pressure (IOP) (Figure 
1a). This study aims to address the concerns of 
existing gelatin-based delivery systems by 
developing highly efficient cell sheet carriers. 
We hypothesize the introduction of porous 
structure to the biopolymer (i.e., gelatin or 
hyaluronic acid) discs will dramatically improve 
aqueous humor circulation, thereby minimizing 
adverse effects of carrier materials on the 
reconstructed corneal tissues (Figure 1b). 
In this paper, we designed a simple stirring 
process combined with freeze-drying method to 
endow the biopolymer carriers with enlarged 
pore structures that impart better delivery 
capabilities. Prior to freezing at -20°C, the 
aqueous gelatin or hyaluronic acid solution was 
vigorously stirred at 25°C (i.e., below the 
gelling temperature) to entrap gas bubbles, 
thereby producing enlarged pores in the 
hydrogel matrix. The samples prepared by 
air-drying method served as controls. After 
cross-linking with 1 mM EDC, various carriers 
were investigated by determinations of swelling 
ratio, mechanical strength, glucose permeability, 
degradability, biocompatibility, and cell sheet 
transferability. The information from functional 
assessment is necessary to evaluate whether the 
proposed porous structure will further improve 
the safety and efficacy of biopolymer carriers 
applied in CEC transplantation therapy.

delivery of cell sheet grafts using gelatin carriers

Experimental 
 
Preparation of Cross-Linked Porous Carriers 
An aqueous solution of gelatin or 
hyaluronic acid was cooled to 25°C and stirred 
with a rate of 350 rpm. After casting into the 
mold, the solution was freezed at -20°C and 
lyophilized. Then, the biopolymer hydrogels 
were cross-linked with 1 mM EDC. Using a 
trephine device, the biomaterial sheets were cut 
out to obtain small discs. 
 
Characterization of Biopolymer Carriers 
The surface and cross-section 
morphologies of carrier discs were examined 
using scanning electron microscopy. Twenty 
different pores were randomly selected, and the 
simultaneous presence of ice crystals and gas 
bubbles resulted in large pore size (461 ± 85 
µm) and high porosity (48.0 ± 1.9%) of 
cross-linked SFD1 carriers.

statistically significant differences (*p < 0.05; n = 5) 
between the non-cross-linked (EDCb) and 
cross-linked (EDCa) groups for each type of gelatin 
disc. 
 
Swelling Tests 
In the AD groups, the swelling ratio 
reached a plateau level of approximately 2.1 
within 1 h of incubation in BSS at 34°C (Figure 
3a). By contrast, significantly higher water 
uptake rates were observed in the SFD1, FD1, 
and FD2 groups. At each time point from 1 to 
12 h, the order of increasing swelling ratio for 
the discs was FD2 > FD1 > SFD1, indicating 
that the extent of cross-linking had a profound 
influence on the water absorption capability of 
gelatin samples. The osmotic driving force of 
the network chains towards infinite dilution will 
cause the hydrogel to imbibe additional water 
after the polar and hydrophobic sites of 
macromolecules have interacted with water 
molecules [9]. The formation of covalent 
cross-links between adjacent polymer chains 
can lead to an elastic network retraction force 
against additional swelling. A higher number of 
cross-links in the SFD1 samples would further 
support the theory that cross-links reduce the 
swelling of gelatin matrices. 
After immersion for 1 h in BSS, all the 
gelatin discs with initial dimension of 7 mm in 
diameter and 700 µm in thickness exhibited 
rapid swelling (Figure 3b-e). In the AD groups, 
the samples disintegrated into small pieces at 18 
h, and therefore the swelling tests were not 
performed entirely. The three types of porous 
gelatin carriers remained structurally intact at 
the end of swelling, although the FD2 samples 
were partially dissolved.

AD, (c) SFD1, (d) FD1, and (e) FD2 are shown 
before testing and after incubation for distinct time 
periods. Incubation time point: hour (h). 
 
 
Biocompatibility Studies 
It is important to examine the cellular 
responses in the adoption of chemical 
cross-linkers due to concerns such as 
cytotoxicity. The biocompatibility of gelatin 
hydrogel carriers was assessed by implanting 
test discs in rabbit anterior chamber. The AD 
samples were visible in the center of the anterior 
chamber and appeared as rigid discs (Figure 7a). 
By contrast, in the SFD1 groups, the 
implantation sites were completely filled with 
pliable porous materials immediately after 
surgery (Figure 7b). At postoperative 6 h, both 
the AD and SFD1 implants became swollen and 
tender, which indicates that the gelatin carriers 
in the intraocular cavity exhibited hydrogel 
properties and might be considered as a 
viscoelastic filler for cell sheet delivery 
applications. On the first postoperative day, 
severe corneal swelling and cloudiness were 
found in the AD groups, while the cornea 
remained clear and the anterior chamber was 
quiet in the SFD1 groups. The differences in the 
tissue responses to implants are probably due to 
the role of material structure. The rabbits 
receiving gelatin discs with dense structure had 
significant corneal inflammation and 
neovascularization at 8 weeks postoperatively. 
However, corneal transparency was maintained 
throughout the 8 weeks after implantation of 
samples with enlarged pore structure. 
The morphology and density of CEC were 
observed by specular microscopy before surgery 
and 8 weeks after gelatin implantation (Figure 
7c). The native rabbit corneal endothelium is a 
single cell layer. The CECs on Descemet’s 
membrane packed together and could be easily 
identified by cellular hexagonality, which was 
found to be a sensitive indicator of endothelial 
damage or instability. The mean preoperative 
CEC density of three rabbit eyes was 3135 ± 
193 cells/mm2. At postoperative 8 weeks, the 
endothelial cell counts of AD groups were not 
available from specular microscopic images 
because the biological responses were too 
severe to be observed (Figure 7d). No 
significant difference was noted in the CEC 
density of SFD1 groups (3041 ± 119 cells/mm2) 
compared with the values before operation (p > 
0.05) (Figure 7e).

the (a) AD and (b) SFD1 groups at different time 
periods after implantation of gelatin discs in the 
anterior chamber. Follow-up time point:

before surgery and 8 weeks after insertion of (d) AD 
and (e) SFD1 samples in the anterior chamber. CD: 
cell density (cells/mm2). Values are mean ± standard 
deviation (n = 3). 
 
To guide successful corneal reconstruction, 
the biomaterial carriers must exhibit excellent 
biocompatibility and biostability. Figure 8a 
shows the IOP profile of AD and SFD1 groups. 
Mean baseline IOP values ranged from 16.5 to 
19.7 mmHg. A sharp fall in the IOP was 
observed immediately after insertion of the 
gelatin discs in the anterior chamber, 
presumably due to the loss of a large amount of 
the aqueous humor through the corneal/limbal 
incision [11]. At postoperative 3 h, the presence 
of swollen hydrogels was able to maintain the 
shape of the anterior chamber. However, a 
significantly higher increase in IOP was noted in 
the AD groups as compared to the SFD1 groups 
(p < 0.05), indicating that the dense gelatin 
materials may result in a greater aqueous humor 
outflow resistance in the trabecular meshwork. 
The IOP changes due to SFD1 implants reverted 
to baseline level within 6 h. By contrast, in 
rabbits receiving AD samples, the IOP was 
maintained at a high level (i.e., about 35 mmHg) 
even at 6 h. During the follow-up period from 1 
SFD1 samples to generate the gelatin-cell sheet 
constructs (Figure 9b). The cross-sections were 
stained for H&E to examine the histological 
structure of the constructs (Figure 9c). The 
fibroblasts were organized as intact cell sheets 
on porous gelatin carriers. To identify the cell 
layers, sections were counterstained with 
Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye to show the 
location of nuclei (Figure 9d).

Conclusions 
 
In this work, we investigated a delivery 
system of porous gelatin hydrogels as cell sheet 
carriers. Among all the gelatin samples studied, 
the discs prepared by a simple stirring process 
combined with freeze-drying method showed 
the best in vitro and in vivo compatibility and 
the most appropriate swelling characteristics 
without squeezing effect on the anterior segment 
tissues of the eye. The enlarged pore structure 
also allowed the materials to contain the highest 
fraction of mobile water and exhibit the lowest 
resistance to the glucose permeation. As a 
temporary supporter, the biodegradable gelatin 
hydrogel could facilitate cell sheet transfer and 
avoid long-term residence of foreign carriers in 
the body. It is concluded that the gelatin discs 
with enlarged pore structure have suitable 
functionality to be further developed as carriers 
for intraocular delivery of cell/tissue sheets. Our 
future interest will be toward more fully 
exploring the potential of this delivery system 
for corneal tissue engineering and regenerative 
medicine.

aims to address the concerns of existing gelatin-based delivery
systems by developing highly efficient cell sheet carriers. We
hypothesize that the introduction of porous structure to the
gelatin discs will dramatically improve aqueous humor circula-
tion, thereby minimizing adverse effects of carrier materials on
the reconstructed corneal tissues (Figure 1b).
There are currently a variety of techniques for fabricating
materials with porous structures such as fiber bonding,17 gas
foaming,18 phase separation,19 and electrospinning.20 Neverthe-
less, these methods involving additives are limited because of
the possible residual toxicity of organic solvents and foaming
agents. Gelatin is well-known to be an aqueous polymer. A
combined procedure, using water as porogen solvent, followed
by freeze-drying, has been proposed to produce porous gelatin
hydrogels.21 As the frozen ice crystal is sublimated in a freeze-
drying process, numerous cavities are created within the bulk
of the biopolymer matrix. In terms of tissue engineering
applications, the pore size and distribution of biomaterials are
of particular importance for regulating nutrient uptake to and
waste removal from the cultured cells. The porous structure of
freeze-dried gelatin hydrogels can be controlled by the size of
ice crystals formed during freezing at different temperatures.21,22
To fabricate highly porous gelatin matrices, an overrun process
method based on the injection of air bubbles and ice recrystal-
lization has been developed.23 Although it is beneficial to mass
transfer, the increase in pore size and porosity may result in
decreased mechanical properties and accelerated degradation
rates of biomaterials. Cross-linking is a necessary step to prepare
stable porous gelatin hydrogels under physiological conditions
while preserving their multifunctionality for cell sheet delivery
use. Gelatin has been chemically modified with various cross-
linkers, including formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, epoxy com-
pounds, carbodiimides, and genipin.24,25 Among them, 1-ethyl-
3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) is particularly
preferable because it can induce cross-linking of biomaterials
without taking part in the linkages but simply change to water-
soluble urea derivatives that have very low cytotoxicity.26
In this article, the gelatin hydrogels with different pore sizes
and porosities were respectively fabricated by adjusting the
freezing temperature to -20 and -196 °C. Furthermore, we
designed a simple stirring process combined with a freeze-drying
method to endow the gelatin carriers with enlarged pore
structures that impart better delivery capabilities. Prior to
freezing at -20 °C, the aqueous gelatin solution was vigorously
stirred at 25 °C (i.e., below the gelling temperature) to entrap
gas bubbles, thereby producing enlarged pores in the hydrogel
matrix. The gelatin samples prepared by air-drying method
served as controls. After cross-linking with 1 mM EDC, various
gelatin carriers were investigated by determinations of swelling
ratio, mechanical strength, glucose permeability, biodegrad-
ability, cytocompatibility, biocompatibility, and cell-adhesive
ability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to
demonstrate the potential advantage of using cross-linked porous
gelatin hydrogels as cell sheet delivery systems. The information
from functional assessment is necessary to evaluate whether the
proposed porous structure will further improve the safety and
efficacy of gelatin carriers applied in CEC transplantation
therapy.
Experimental Section
Materials. Gelatin (type A; 300 Bloom), EDC, and matrix metal-
loproteinase-2 (MMP-2, EC 3.4.24.24) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. Balanced salt solution (BSS, pH 7.4) was obtained from Alcon.
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from
Gibco-BRL. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the antibiotic/antimycotic
(A/A) solution were obtained from Biological Industries. Temperature-
responsive culture dishes (35 mm in diameter, UpCell Surface) were
purchased from CellSeed.
Preparation of Cross-Linked Porous Gelatin Carriers. An
aqueous solution of 10 wt % gelatin was prepared by dissolution of
gelatin powder in double-distilled water at 40 °C. The 5 mL of resulting
solution was then poured in a polystyrene planar mold (5 × 5 cm2, 1.5
cm depth), subjected to freezing at -20 (FD1 group) or -196 °C (FD2
group) for 24 h, and lyophilized at -55 °C for 2 days. On the other
hand, the 5 mL of gelatin solution was cooled to 25 °C and stirred
with a rate of 350 rpm for 20 min. After casting into the mold, the
solution was subjected to freezing at -20 °C (SFD1 group) for 24 h
and lyophilized at -55 °C for 2 days. As a control, the gelatin solution
(35 mL) prepared at 40 °C was poured in the mold and air-dried for
three days at 25 °C (AD group).
All fabricated gelatin hydrogel sheets were cross-linked by immersing
in an ethanol/water mixture (8:2 v/v, pH 4.75) of 1 mM EDC at 25 °C
for 12 h. The samples were thoroughly washed with double-distilled
water to remove excess EDC and urea byproduct. Subsequently, the
cross-linked gelatin hydrogels were subjected to freezing at -20 °C
for 24 h and lyophilized again. Using a 7 mm diameter corneal trephine
device, the hydrogel sheets were cut out to obtain gelatin discs (∼700
µm in thickness).
Characterization of Cross-Linked Porous Gelatin Carriers.
Specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
as previously described.27,28 The surface and cross-section morphologies
of gelatin discs were examined using SEM (Hitachi). Twenty different
pores were randomly selected, and the average pore diameters were
calculated.
The solvent replacement method was used for porosity measure-
ments.29 Each gelatin disk was first dried to constant weight (Wi) in
vacuo. The test samples were immersed in absolute ethanol overnight,

structure.

possessed enlarged pore structure without dense surface skin
formation. The simultaneous presence of ice crystals and gas
bubbles resulted in large pore size (461 ( 85 µm) and high
porosity (48.0 ( 1.9%) of cross-linked SFD1 carriers. The order
of increasing cross-linking index for the discs was SFD1 > FD1
> FD2 > AD, indicating that the material structure may play an
important role in the cross-linking reaction. Detailed results and
discussion are provided in the Supporting Information.
Swelling Tests. It is known that the swelling ratio is one of
the most important parameters for evaluating hydrogels and is
correlated to the biomaterial structure. The mechanism of
hydration of gelatin is a capillary phenomenon of water
molecules penetrating the tiny interstices of triple-helical fibrils
in the gelatin matrix.9 In this study, the water absorption
capability of various gelatin discs was determined by a
gravimetric method (Figure 3a). In the AD groups, the swelling
ratio reached a plateau level of ∼2.1 within 1 h of incubation
in BSS at 34 °C. In contrast, significantly higher water uptake
rates were observed in the SFD1, FD1, and FD2 groups. At
each time point from 1 to 12 h, the order of increasing swelling
ratio for the discs was FD2 > FD1 > SFD1, indicating that the
extent of cross-linking had a profound influence on the water
absorption capability of gelatin samples. The osmotic driving
force of the network chains toward infinite dilution will cause
the hydrogel to imbibe additional water after the polar and
hydrophobic sites of macromolecules have interacted with water
molecules.36 The formation of covalent cross-links between
adjacent polymer chains can lead to an elastic network retraction
force against additional swelling. A higher number of cross-
links in the SFD1 samples would further support the theory that
cross-links reduce the swelling of gelatin matrices. It was noted
that although the AD carriers had the lowest cross-linking index,
these samples showed the relatively low swelling ratio at 6 h.
Risbud et al. have shown that bulk water is unable to penetrate
the matrix because of the very low porosity of air-dried hydrogel
membranes.35 Our findings suggest that the porous structure of
gelatin carrier may be responsible for its high water absorption
and high water retention properties.
An ideal condition for intraocular grafting of CEC sheets is
that the hydrogel carriers should swell rapidly to a size large
enough to facilitate the attachment of bioengineered cell
monolayers onto corneal posterior surfaces. The residence of

In the whole range of frequencies investigated, G′ of EDC
cross-linked gelatin hydrogels was higher than G′′, and no
crossover point between G′ and G′′ was observed. This indicates
that the sample behaves like an elastic solid. For cross-linked
biopolymer with the formation of an elastic gel network, G′
and G′′ maintain a constant value and are parallel to each other
at higher degrees of cross-linking.40 Our results suggest that
among the porous gelatin carriers, the SFD1 samples can possess
relatively high mechanical strength to support surgical handling.
Determination of Freezable Water Content. The nature of
water in hydrogel materials is important to control the solute
diffusion mechanism.41 There are three main types of waters
in swollen hydrogels: nonfreezable bound water, freezable bound
water, and free water.42 For the AD samples, the lower
temperature peak (about -1 °C) was attributed to freezable
bound water, and the higher temperature peak (about 3 °C) was
attributed to free water (Figure 5a). In contrast, only one melting
peak was observed in the curves for SFD1, FD1, and FD2
samples at ∼0 °C. A study from Wan et al. demonstrated that
sharp peaks at ∼2 °C were found for porous fibrous membranes
made from acrylonitrile-based polymers, whereas a visible
shoulder appeared for the corresponding dense membrane.43 In
accordance with these data, we found that freezable bound water
did not exist in porous gelatin discs, or the amount of this type
of water was very small. One possible explanation is that the
water molecules filled in the space between network chains and
the center of pores are almost freely mobile. However, for
gelatin samples with dense structure, the movement of water
molecules was restricted by the limited free volume.
The solute permeability of hydrogels strongly depends on the
fraction of water that is available for solute diffusion (i.e.,
freezable water). The content of freezable water is indicative
of the total amount of freezable bound and free water in swollen
gelatin hydrogels. As shown in Figure 5b, the freezable water
content in the AD, SFD1, FD1, and FD2 groups was 0.59 (
0.03, 0.88 ( 0.03, 0.83 ( 0.01, and 0.77 ( 0.01, respectively.
This indicates that the mobile fraction of water significantly
increased with increasing porosity of gelatin materials (p < 0.05).
In addition to pore structure, the extent of cross-linking is
another important factor affecting freezable water content of
gelatin hydrogels. The water molecules in swollen discs may
be interacted with free carboxylic acid and amino groups of
gelatin by hydrogen bonding. When the two hydrogen atoms
of water molecules are firmly fixed to the amino acid residues
of gelatin, such water is referred to as nonfreezable bound water
(Figure 5c). With increasing cross-linking index, the number
of remaining free carboxylic acid and amino groups significantly
decreased. Therefore, the SFD1 samples had the least amount
of nonfreezable bound water, whose mobility is completely
retarded. These findings suggest that the gelatin carriers prepared
by a simple stirring process combined with freeze-drying method
contain a high fraction of mobile water and may be beneficial
to solute diffusion.
Glucose Permeation Studies. The aqueous humor is an
intraocular fluid responsible for the supply of nutrients to and
removal of metabolic wastes from the avascular cornea. Because
the implantation of gelatin hydrogels in the anterior chamber
may affect mass transport, it is necessary to measure nutrient
permeability through carrier materials for predicting their
success. At each time point, the amount of permeated glucose
was significantly higher in the SFD1 groups, compared with
those of the AD, FD1, and FD2 groups (p < 0.05) (Figure 6).
Additionally, we noticed that the initial relatively rapid perme-
ation rate decreased with time as the SFD1 samples became
saturated with the solute. Yanagawa et al. have shown that the
permeability of dextran is strongly influenced by the complexity

of the loss of a large amount of the aqueous humor through the
corneal/limbal incision.32 At postoperative 3 h, the presence of
swollen hydrogels was able to maintain the shape of the anterior
chamber. However, a significantly higher increase in IOP was
noted in the AD groups as compared with the SFD1 groups (p
< 0.05), indicating that the dense gelatin materials may result
in a greater aqueous humor outflow resistance in the trabecular
meshwork. The IOP changes due to SFD1 implants reverted to
the baseline level within 6 h. In contrast, in rabbits receiving
AD samples, the IOP was maintained at a high level (i.e., about
35 mmHg) even at 6 h. During the follow-up period from 1 to
5 days, the IOP gradually decreased below baseline values. One
possible explanation is that the swelling of AD implants causes
a squeezing effect on the tissue (Swelling Tests section), thereby
enlarging the corneal/limbal incision and producing a substantial
loss of aqueous humor. Our data demonstrate that the material
structure of gelatin carriers may affect the balance of IOP.
To evaluate the biodegradability of gelatin implants in the
anterior chamber, we analyzed the aqueous humor from each
rabbit eye for hydroxyproline, which is an amino acid marker
of collagen. At 8 weeks postoperatively, the amount of
hydroxyproline did not show a significant difference between
the control (9.9 ( 0.3 µg/mL of aqueous humor) and SFD1
(10.3 ( 0.3 µg/mL of aqueous humor) groups (p > 0.05) (Figure
9b). Furthermore, these values were significantly lower than
those of the AD (35.1 ( 0.2 µg/mL of aqueous humor) groups
(p < 0.05). The total hydroxyproline content is 12.5 g per 100 g
protein in collagen.34 In this study, the initial weight of a gelatin
disk was ∼30 mg, indicating that the amount of hydroxyproline
was 12.5 mg/mL of aqueous humor immediately after surgery.
Although the differences in amount of hydroxyproline between
AD and SFD1 groups are noted, both samples have a very high
in vivo degradability of >99.7% at the end of follow-up.
The histological findings for various groups at 8 weeks
postoperatively are shown in Figure 9c-e. In the control groups,
no inflammation reaction was observed. H&E staining demon-
strated normal cornea and iris. The cornea comprises three
layers: the multilayered epithelium, the thick stroma consisting
of keratocytes and orthogonally arranged collagen lamellae, and
the endothelium. In the AD groups, significant infiltration of
inflammatory cells was noted on the anterior and posterior
surfaces of cornea. Additionally, the exposure to dense gelatin
materials caused corneal neovascularization and stromal edema.
In contrast, no adverse inflammatory reaction was found after
implantation of SFD1 samples, indicating good biocompatibility.
To guide successful corneal reconstruction, the biomaterial
carriers must exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biostability.
In general, biocompatibility is governed mainly by the interface
between foreign materials and host living tissues.32,33 Here the
implant-tissue interaction was determined by corneal morpho-
logical studies, IOP measurements, and histological examina-
tions. The results suggest that the implantation of AD samples
may induce undesirable host reactions and some adverse
biological effects. Sweeney et al. have shown that after insertion
into the feline cornea, the membrane implants with pore diameter
<100 nm interferes the nutrition from the aqueous humor and
leads to the degeneration of both the stroma and the epithelium
accompanied by ulceration and neovascularization.51 Similar to
their observations, our study clearly shows that the pore size of
gelatin carriers is a potential factor involved in the maintenance
of nutritional needs of the cornea and the regulation of tissue
responses to implants. The CEC counts are not significantly

keratoplasty, a temporary air bubble in the anterior chamber is
used for donor tissue adherence.53 Additionally, the viscoelastic
filler is commonly applied in cataract surgery to maintain
anterior chamber depth and protect the corneal endothelium.54
On the basis of these previous reports and our experience, the
bioadhesive gelatin hydrogel may be considered as a candidate
to develop an efficient carrier material in cell sheet delivery
applications.9 Here we further investigate the role of pore
structure on the functionality of novel cell sheet carriers.
Although the materials lose some mechanical strength when
fabricated into porous matrices, the EDC cross-linked gelatin
carriers with enlarged pore structure can provide sufficient
support for cell sheet attachment.
Conclusions
In this work, we investigated a delivery system of porous
gelatin hydrogels as cell sheet carriers. Among all of the
gelatin samples studied, the discs prepared by a simple
stirring process combined with the freeze-drying method
showed the best in vitro and in vivo compatibility and the
most appropriate swelling characteristics without squeezing
effect on the anterior segment tissues of the eye. The enlarged
pore structure also allowed the materials to contain the
highest fraction of mobile water and exhibit the lowest
resistance to the glucose permeation. As a temporary sup-
porter, the biodegradable gelatin hydrogel could facilitate cell
sheet transfer and avoid long-term residence of foreign
carriers in the body. It is concluded that the gelatin discs
with enlarged pore structure have suitable functionality to
be further developed as carriers for intraocular delivery of
cell/tissue sheets. Our future interest will be toward more
fully exploring the potential of this delivery system for
corneal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

simple stirring process and freeze-drying, can possibly eliminate the problem of mass transfer due to 
skin formation. 
Irrespective of cross-linking, the samples from the AD group were structurally very dense, having a 
porosity of approximately zero. The carrier porosity in the SFD1 (61.3 ± 0.9%) group was significantly 
higher than those of the FD1 (41.7 ± 1.2%) and FD2 (14.0 ± 0.8%) groups (p < 0.05), which possibly 
suggests that the entrapment of gas bubbles could increase the pore volume of the non-cross-linked 
samples. A similar trend in porosity variation was found for the cross-linked porous gelatin matrices. 
Our results also showed that the EDC cross-linking significantly reduced the porosity of SFD1 or FD1 
samples (p < 0.05). 
Gelatin is an aqueous biopolymer and can be easily dissolved in physiological condition. To improve 
the stability of delivery carriers, the gelatin materials used in this work were treated with 1 mM EDC. 
The reaction mechanism for the EDC cross-linking of gelatin has been reported in the literature.4 The 
formation of cross-links (i.e., amide bonds) within the gelatin is achieved by nucleophilic attack of the 
free amino groups of lysine and hydroxylysine residues on the activated carboxylic acid groups of 
glutamic and aspartic acid residues, with release of water-soluble urea by-products. The cross-linking 
index in the AD, SFD1, FD1, and FD2 groups was 5.3 ± 1.0, 45.8 ± 1.0, 33.0 ± 1.4, and 13.9 ± 1.8%, 
respectively (Figure S1a). It has been reported that the generation of cross-links within the triple helices 
of collagen is affected by the collision frequency of tropocollagen molecules with chemical cross-
linkers.5 As shown in Figure S1b, the existence of pores greatly increased the contact area between the 
gelatin and EDC. Therefore, the exposure of porous carriers to cross-linkers increased the collision 
frequency and reaction probability compared with that obtained for the discs with dense structure. This 
may explain the highest extent of cross-linking observed for SFD1 sample.

Gel Permeation Chromatography. 
Methods 
After enzymatic degradation, five replicates of aqueous solutions collected at each time point were 
combined, vortexed, and pipetted into a syringe for filtration (0.45 µm filter, Millipore). The system for 
GPC consisted of a HPLC-pump and a RI 2000 refractive index detector (Schambeck SFD) with four 
thermostated (37°C) columns (Shodex SB series, OHpak SB-802 HQ (exclusion limit 4 × 103 Da); 
OHpak SB-802.5 HQ (exclusion limit 1 × 104 Da); OHpak SB-803 HQ (exclusion limit 1 × 105 Da); 
OHpak SB-804 HQ (exclusion limit 1 × 106 Da); Showa Denko). The mobile phase was 18 g/l sodium 
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in Milli-Q water. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and 
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) standards (Polymer Standards Service) ranging between 434 and 932000 
g/mol were used for calibration. The chromatograms were analyzed with Analab EC2000 Data System. 
Results and discussion 
The interest in gelatin for the production of cell carriers is its biodegradability in the body. Gelatin is 
composed primarily of amino acid residues and is susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. Collagenolytic 
enzymes, including gelatinases, are capable of causing scission of peptide bonds within the 
characteristic poly-l-proline type of helical regions of the molecule.6 Figure S2 shows the GPC 
chromatograms of various gelatin hydrogels after enzymatic degradation for 1 day. The most rapid 
elution took place for the molecules of the SFD1 samples as they passed through the chromatography 
column. This indicates that the formation of more amide linkages within the gelatin hydrogels may 
contribute to the increase in molecular weight of biomacromolecules.

Cytocompatibility Studies. 
Methods 
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board and were performed in 
accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Ten 
adult New Zealand white rabbits (National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center, Taipei, 
Taiwan, ROC) were used for cytocompatibility studies. Primary rabbit CEC cultures were prepared 
according to previously published methods.7 
Second-passage rabbit CECs (7 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates containing regular 
growth medium and incubated overnight to allow cell attachment. Cells were synchronized in the G0-
phase of the cell cycle (quiescence) by a further incubation for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS. 
Then, the medium was replaced with fresh Medium 199 containing 2% FBS, to mimic the lower serum 
conditions of the anterior chamber in vivo. Using cell culture inserts, each well of a 24-well plate was 
divided into two compartments. The gelatin discs were sterilized in a 70% ethanol solution overnight. 
Subsequently, the samples were thoroughly rinsed in sterilized PBS and placed into inner well of the 
double-chamber system to examine the cultures after exposure to test materials. Rabbit CECs in 
Medium 199 containing 2% FBS without gelatins served as control groups. 
After incubation for 2 days, the qualitative and quantitative assays were performed as described 
previously.8 Cell morphology was observed by phase-contrast microscopy (Nikon). In addition, cell 
growth was estimated using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation MTS Assay 
(Promega). All experiments were performed in five replicates, and the results were expressed as relative 
MTS activity when compared to control groups. Cell viability was determined by a membrane integrity 
assay, using the Live/Dead Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes). Under fluorescence 
microscopy (Carl Zeiss), three different areas each containing approximately 500 cells were counted at 
100× magnification. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the viability of the cultures was 
expressed as the average ratio of live cells to the total number of cells in these six different areas. 
Results and discussion 
 9
gelatin hydrogels with lower cross-linking degrees is probably due to ionic interactions between the test 
biopolymers and nutrients in culture media. These results support the report by Park et al. showing that 
the medium nutrient components (i.e., basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β) 
can be easily enveloped in the molecules of negatively charged hyaluronic acid, thereby leading to less 
cell proliferation.11 For the hydrogel carriers prepared by a simple stirring process combined with 
freeze-drying method, EDC cross-linking consumes large amounts of both free carboxylic acid and 
amino groups of gelatin and reduces the strength of ionic interactions. Furthermore, the enlarged pore 
structure may facilitate nutrient availability to cells. Thus, the SFD1 samples are well tolerated during 
rabbit CEC proliferation.

noted that the cells exposed to formaldehyde cross-linked gelatins 
had relatively higher lactate dehydrogenase activity, cytotoxicity, 
and interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 levels than did those to 
carbodiimide cross-linked samples. In contrast to other three types 
of cross-linked gelatins, the carriers modified with carbodiimide 
showed better capability for delivering intact retinal sheets. 
Conclusions: The present study suggests that carbodiimide cross-
linked gelatin carriers may have great potential for retinal tissue 
engineering.
