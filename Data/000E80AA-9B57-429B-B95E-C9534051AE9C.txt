beam with inclination and setting angle is investigated. The extensional deformation and the 
Coriolis force effect are both taken into account. The beam considered is doubly symmetric so that 
the centroidal axis and the neutral axis are coincident. By utilizing the Hamilton’s principle and the 
consistent linearization of a geometrically non-linear beam theory, three coupled governing 
differential equations with variable coefficients are derived. In general, the exact solutions of the 
system are not available. In the present study, the governing equation is solved using the 
semi-analytical transition matrix method. Utilizing the proposed solution procedure, the respective 
effects of taper ratio, setting angle, inclination angle, hub radius, rotational speed on the natural 
frequency of the beam are systematically explored.  
 
 
 
 
2  Dynamic System 
Consider the free vibration of a rotating inclined tapered Timoshenko beam, as shown in 
Figure 1. The beam is mounted with a setting angle ψ  and an inclination angle θ  on a hub with 
radius rh. It rotates with a constant angular velocity Ω. Three coordinate 
systems, 0 0 0O X Y Z− , 1 1 1G X Y Z−  and 2 2 2G X Y Z− , are used in expression of the configuration (see 
Fig 1). The centroidal axis of the beam is correspondent with X2 axis. It is assumed that the 
thickness of the beam is relatively small to the width of the beam. Let 1P  (see Fig. 2) be an 
arbitrary point in the beam element, and P be the point corresponding to 1P  on the centroidal axis. 
The position vector of point 1P , after deformation, can be expressed as

It is noted that the nonlinear term for normal strain in Eq. (5) is required not to be removed in order 
for appropriate explanation about the influence of centrifugal force on the bending stiffness. Using 
of a first-order linear normal strain will result in a spurious loss of bending stiffness. 
By utilizing the Hamilton principle and the consistent linearization of the non-linear beam 
theory [8], the governing differential equations for the rotating inclined Timoshenko beam are

4  Governing Characteristic Dimensionless Differential Equations

solution of equations (17a-c) in the form

5  Solution Method 
In the governing equations, it is noted that rA  rI  and pN  are all variable with position ξ . 
Generally, it is not easy to obtain the exact solution of the governing equations. A semi-analytical 
method is proposed in the present paper. The governing equations are expressed with state variables 
in the following.

However, it is difficult to determine the multiple integrals of the series analytically or numerically. 
Hence, an approximate transition matrix is required. In this paper, a simple and efficient algorithm 
program is developed to find the approximate transition matrix. 
By approximating the coefficient matrix ( )A ξ  by n piecewise constant coefficients matrices 
( ), 1, 2,..., ,iA s i n=  one obtains a characteristic governing equation with constant coefficient matrix. 
Here, is  can be a any value between [ ]1 ,i iξ ξ−  and iξ  denotes the coordinate position at the end 
of the i th subsection. Consequently, the transition matrix of the i th subsection from 1iξ −  to iξ  
can be obtained as 
 1( )( )1 1( , ) , ( , )i i

After applying the composition property of the transition matrix, i.e., 
1 1 1 1( , ) ( , ) ( , )i i i i i iT T Tξ ξ ξ ξ ξ ξ+ − + −= , the transition matrix from the first subsection to the ith 
subsection is obtained

It can be seen that if the coefficient matrix A  in the Peano- Baker series is constant, the 
transition matrix (28) is the same as Eq. (36). Hence, when the number of subsection approaches 
infinity, the approximate transition matrix becomes the exact one. It can be obtained at any desired 
level of accuracy by taking a suitable number of subsections.

account to investigate the effect on the free vibration of a rotating beam. The Coriolis force effect is 
considered. The axial deformation is also considered. Timoshenko beam model is assumed. Based 
on large slenderness, the centrifugally stiffened force is obtained such that the axial deformation is 
ignored. Due to complication, the governing equations are solved using the semi-analytical 
transition matrix approach. The conclusion is in the following: 
1. The natural frequencies significantly increase as the rotating speed increase due to the 
centrifugally stiffened effect of rotation as expected. 
2. Increasing the taper ratio in the thickness or breadth increases the fundamental natural 
frequencies observably. 
3. A rotating beam with a large setting angle has a low natural frequency. 
4. The natural frequencies of the second mode decrease with a nearly linear manner as the taper 
ratio along the breadth direction increases, and near the taper ratio come near the value 1, the 
natural frequencies oppositely increase. 
5. A rotating beam with a small inclination angle has a high natural frequency.
