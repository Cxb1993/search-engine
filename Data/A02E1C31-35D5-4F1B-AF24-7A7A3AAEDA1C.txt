I. Introduction 
With developing of optical fibers in communication system, for both long 
distance and local area networks, much effort has attracted the realization of high 
speed and high efficiency optical detectors operated at the low-loss wavelength of 
1310 nm. III-V semiconductors show high detection efficiency at the same 
wavelength; however they are difficult and expensive when applied in 
well-established silicon (Si) technology. In contrast, germanium (Ge) material has 
been applied on high-speed photodetectors (PDs) integrated with Si substrate in terms 
of the advantages of potential compatibility with Si integrated-circuit technology, high 
carrier mobility, and high optical absorption coefficient at 1310 nm [1].  
Metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) PDs are promising candidates for 
optoelectronic IC due to their low capacitance, large device bandwidth, and easy 
fabrication [2, 3]. However, the observed high dark current in MSM-PDs is a major 
fatality due to low Schottky barrier-height (SBH). The high dark current would be 
further aggravated when Ge is employed because its narrow band gap of 0.66 eV and 
strong Fermi-level pinning at metal/Ge interface [4]. Previously, many methods were 
proposed to reduce such dark current, for example, inserting of a-Ge or Si:C between 
metal and semiconductor [5, 6], sandwiching dopant segregation layer at 
metal/semiconductor interface [4], asymmetric metal electrodes [7], and passivating 
 4 
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured by an HP-4155B semiconductor 
parameter analyzer with an illumination at 1310 nm from a laser source. 
III. Results and Discussion 
Fig. 2 shows I-V characteristics for samples A and B. Observation show that the 
sample A has about the same photo- and dark-current, demonstrating a poor 
signal-to-noise ratio is obtained in MGM-PDs. The rather large dark current is 
resulting from the carriers over the barrier-height at Au/Ge interface and surface 
defect centers. After inserting a-Si:H layer between Au and Ge, the dark current is 
reduced from 7.65x10-3 A for sample A to 4.46x10-5 A for sample B under 3-V 
bias-voltage. Such a result clarifies larger barrier-height existed at Au/a-Si:H interface 
than the barrier at Au/Ge. In order to measure the barrier-height, Schottky diodes of 
Au/a-Si:H/Ge and Au/Ge were fabricated. Using thermionic emission model and SBH 
were evaluated to be 0.55 and 1.05 eV for the samples A and B, respectively [10]. The 
SBH of 0.55 eV for the sample A is consistent with the previous report, where the 
Fermi-level is pinned between 0.54 and 0.61 eV below the conduction-band edge [11]. 
From Fig. 2, although with the reduction in dark current, the photo current responding 
to 1310 nm light source is also lowered by a magnitude of 31 in sample B.  
The reductions in dark- and photo-current can be explained using band-diagram, 
depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows band-diagram of pure MGM-PDs. The dark current 
 6 
magnitude of 1116. The dark current for sample C is even lower than in sample B by a 
magnitude of 6.6, meaning the a-Si:H acted as a role of passivation is more effective 
in reducing dark current than the a-Si:H as SBH enhancement layer. It was reported 
that the Ge surface has much surface state, caused by the dangling bond, resulting in 
Fermi-level pinning between metal and Ge [4, 11]. These surface states also offer the 
leakage path between two metal electrodes in MGM-PDs. When a-Si:H is passivated 
on Ge surface, the hydrogen in a-Si:H can diffuse into the defect sites, effectively 
passivating dangling bond states, leading to lower dark current [9,12]. Another 
advantage for the sample C is higher photocurrent due to no a-Si:H block-layer 
existed between Au and Ge. Responsivity of sample C responding to 1310 nm light 
source is 0.72 A/W, which has a quantum efficiency of 68 % under bias-voltage of 
3-V. Noise rejection ability in MGM-PDs can be expressed by photo-to-dark current 
ratio (PDR) and shown in Fig. 5. Samples A and B show smaller PDR than 10, 
demonstrating a poor noise rejection and can not be applied in photodetectors 
practically. In contrast, a very high PDR of 6530 is achieved in sample C due to most 
of the defect centers on Ge surface is passivated by a-Si:H. 
IV. Conclusions 
A-Si:H has been applied on MGM-PDs to reduce dark current. Observation 
shows that the a-Si:H can effectively enhance SBH, hence suppressing dark current,
