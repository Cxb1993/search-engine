Abstract 
A  high-tech industry imperatively needs a 
shop floor information system to monitor the 
production dynamics for improving the productivity 
and efficiency. In the industrial application, the 
manufacturing execution system (MES) is adopted to 
perform the task. MES have evolved to fill the 
communication gap between the manufacturing 
planning system (MRP, MRPII, ERP) and the control 
systems used to run equipment on the plant floor. 
Therefore, data collection is an important issue for 
MES. RFID is considered as a useful device for 
collecting and tracking the real time status of WIP, 
mobile resources and production-supported 
resources for its abilities of wireless transmission and 
multiple read/write. For implementing RFID on the 
shop floor, we must establish the integration 
infrastructure firstly. In our research, standard coding 
rules for items and carriers, data handshaking model 
between reader and tag, data collection architecture 
will be proposed. RFID based cell controller will also 
be implemented in this research. Practical WIP 
tracking systems based on RFID technology are also 
developed in this research. 
The goals of this research are to: (1) design 
information infrastructure for RFID based 
manufacturing systems; (2) develop a cell controller 
for RFID based manufacturing systems; and (3) 
develop an RFID based WIP tracking model. In the 
third year, we have completed four major tasks: (1) 
Establish an RFID based flexible manufacturing 
system. (2) Control FMS based on WIP data written 
on RFID tags. (3) Integrate with Intelligent Decision 
Support System. (4) Develop PDA application with 
FMS.

The goals of this research are to: (1) design 
information infrastructure for RFID based 
manufacturing systems; (2) develop a cell controller 
for RFID based manufacturing systems; and (3) 
develop an RFID based WIP tracking model. In the 
third year, we have completed four major tasks: (1) 
Establish an RFID based flexible manufacturing 
system. (2) Control FMS based on WIP data written 
on RFID tags. (3) Integrate with Intelligent Decision 
Support System. (4) Develop PDA application with 
FMS. 
 
Accomplishment 1: Establish an RFID based flexible 
manufacturing system. 
We have es tablished an RFID-based FMS in 
the MES Lab of National Taipei University of 
Technology. This FMS consists of four virtual 
equipments, one loading station, one RGV, one 
unloading robot (ABB IRB 2000) and nine buffer 
stations. Omron passive tag (530KHz, 254 Bytes) is 
attached in each pallet and each pallet contains four 
workpieces (as shown in Figure 1). In this system, the 
updated status of pallet is written to pallet’s tag by 
means of reader when the operation is completed in 
each virtual equipment. When workpiece finish all its 
operation steps and pallet is moved to unloading 
station, the robot will pick each workpiece to its 
position according to the tag content written in 
previous operation steps.

Accomplishment 2: Control FMS based on WIP data 
written on RFID tags. 
In the second year, we have constructed 
modular Colored Petri Models for equipment (CNC), 
material handling system (mobile robot), Loading 
station, unloading machine and RFID reader. In the 
third year, we attempt to write attributes (color of 
places) of CPN model into RFID tags. The updated 
status of pallet (i.e. colored token of CPN model) is 
written to pallet’s tag by means of reader when the 
operation is completed in each virtual equipment. The 
content of colored tokens of CPN model and related 
RFID tag content are listed as shown in Table 1. Some 
reading and writing screens shown in monitor screen 
of cell controller are shown in Figure 1-2.

Accomplishment 3: Integrate with Intelligent 
Decision Support System. 
We have integrated our RFID based FMS with 
Intelligent Decision Support Sytsem (IDSS), 
developed by ITRI. Cell controller sends all shop floor 
status to IDSS, and IDSS feedbacks inferring results 
(i.e. RGV from to command) to cell controller. IDSS 
runs over JESS (Java Expert System Shell) which is a 
rule engine and scripting environment written entirely 
in Sun's JavaTM language. The JESS shell provides the

3. Evaluation 
The accomplishments of this research are the 
same as the proposal listed. The RFID based FMS is 
the only one existed in Taiwan’s college. It also offers 
a testbed for testing various RFID applications in 
production system.
