ENIG/SnxCu/ENIG, We investigates the electromigration 
(EM) effect on the different interfacial compound 
phases at Sn(Cu) solder/ENIG  interfaces.  The 
interfacial Ni3Sn4 phase at the Sn0.7 wt.% Cu/ENIG 
joint interface was quickly depleted after a short 50 
h of current stressing. The inference drawn is that 
the Ni atoms in the Ni3Sn4 phase at the joint 
interface are likely forced out under current 
stressing； however, the ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound 
effectively reduces the EM-driven Ni flux into a Sn 
bump； thus, a significantly lower Ni(P) consumption 
was observed at the Sn1 wt.% Cu/ENIG interface.  
However, for the Sn1 wt.% Cu/ENIG case, formation of 
a Ni3P layer was scarcely observed. Moreover, the 
initial (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the interface appeared 
compact with a layer-type structure, which reduced 
the EM-driven Ni diffusion.

作一系統的說明與討論。主要分為兩個部分 (1) Sn5Ag/Cu系統和
(2)SnxCu/ENIG系統。第(1)部分，我們發現一個可以抑制電遷移效應誘發銅墊

會逆電子流方向移動，同時在陰極端Sn5Ag/Cu界面上形成Ag3Sn的化合物層。
這現象指出電遷移效應對於銀 (Ag)雜質原子在錫 (Sn)母體中，其靜電力
(electrostatic force)較常見的電子風力(wind force) 更主宰了銀(Ag)雜質原子的

1. Introduction 
    Flip-chip technology was first invented 
by IBM in 1960s. The key features of the 
flip-chip technology are: (1) micro solder 
bumps are fabricated on the IC (Integrated 
Circuit) chip side and (2) the bumped chip is 
flipped over to join the metal bond pads on the 
package substrate. Nowadays, flip-chip 
technology has been successfully used for 
CPU (Center Process Unit) assembly for 
decades. According to the semiconductor 
roadmap, the expected size of the flip-chip 
solder bump should approach 50 μm by 2010 
[1]. Hence, the current density in the solder 
bumps will also increase substantially to over 
104 amp/cm2 [2]. Under such a high current 
density, electromigration-induced failure 
becomes a serious reliability issue for the 
shrinking flip-chip solder bumps [2-5]. 
It is known that alloying can enhance the 
electromigration resistance of metals. For 
example, alloying with a small percentage of 
Cu can increase the electromigration lifetime 
of Al(Cu) over conventional Al interconnect 
lines by at least one order of magnitude [6]. It 
has also been shown by some researchers that 
the electromigration resistance of Sn-based 
solder alloys can be improved by alloying 
with Cu additives [6-8]. Also, Ag is a very 
important additive in the current Pb-free 
solder candidates, because it can enhance the 
mechanical properties, such as, fatigue and 
creep lifetime [9-11]. Hence, how the Ag 
additives affect the electromigration behavior 
of Sn-based solder bumps is an important 
issue to examine. So, In the first study, we 
investigated Ag electromigration in 
current-stressed SnAg/Cu solder bumps.  
However, another compelling issue also has 
been focused, which is about the EM induced 
failure on ENIG/Sn-based solder joint.  
An electroless nickel/immersion gold 
(ENIG) bond pad has been used as a surface 
finish for decades and continues to offer many 
significant advantages to the printed circuit 
board (PCB) industry [12-13]. An ENIG bond 
pad has many advantages including a low-cost 
plating process and high corrosion resistance; 
however, the major advantage for using the 
ENIG bond pad is its excellent barrier 
function against an excessive soldering 
reaction and out-diffusion from the metal 
bond pad beneath the ENIG bond pad, such as 
a Cu soldering layer [14-15]. At the present 
time, Pb-free solders are normally used in the 
electronic packaging industry [16-18]. 
Many studies have shown that most Pb-free 
solders contain a high Sn content, typically 
over 95 wt% [19-20]. When a Sn-rich Pb-free 
solder is used to solder the ENIG Ni(P) bond 
pad, both Ni3Sn4 and Cu6Sn5 phases may form 
at the joint interface between the Ni(P) and the 
Sn-rich solder, which also contains Cu. If the 
Cu content in the Pb-free solder is lower than 
0.3 wt%, only (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 is formed at the 
interface; however, when the Cu concentration 
is higher than 0.6 wt%, the ternary 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound phase forms. When 
the Cu concentration is between 0.3 and 0.6 
wt%, both (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 
phases may coexist at the joint interface 
[21-23]. The purpose of the second study is to 
investigate the EM effect (under a high 
current density of 104 A/cm2) on the different 
interfacial compound phases formed at 
Pb-free Sn(Cu) solders/ENIG interfaces. This 
study concluded that the phases of the

3. Results and Discussion 
(I) The Sn5Ag/Cu system: 
Figs. 3 (a) and (b) show cross-sectional 
SEM images of pure Sn solder bumps on Cu 
foils after 5 h and 40 h current-stressing at 130 
℃. The stressing current density is 5000 
A/cm2. We found that a significant amount of 
Cu6Sn5 compound phase formed in the Sn 
solder bumps after current-stressing. 
 
 
Fig. 3: SEM cross-sectional images of Sn 
joints on Cu foils under 5000 A/cm2 after: (a) 
5 h; (b) 40 h of current stressing time 
 
   It has been reported by many researchers 
that this significant Cu6Sn5 compound phase 
formation is caused by electromigration 
induced Cu dissolution from the Cu pad [2,4]. 
The dissolved Cu atoms electromigrate into 
the solder bump to form Cu6Sn5 compound 
phase in the solder bump. Fig. 4 shows SEM 
cross-sectional images of the current-stressed 
Sn5Ag/Cu bumps under 5000 A/cm2 for 
different stressing times at 130 ℃.

current-stressed Sn5Ag/Cu bumps under 5000 
A/cm2 for different stressing time at 130 ℃: 
(a) 5 h; (b) 40 h 
 
Remarkably, Ag3Sn compound phase was 
found to form in the interfacial Cu6Sn5 
compound layer at the Sn5Ag/Cu joint 
interface. In addition, unlike the case of the 
current-stressed pure Sn/Cu bump, there was 
no obvious Cu6Sn5 compound phase to be 
observed in the solder bump. The above 
results suggest that the formation of the 
Ag3Sn compound layer on the interfacial 
Cu6Sn5 compound layer prevented the 
dissolution of the Cu pad into the solder 
bump.      
The formation of the Ag3Sn compound 
layer on the interfacial Cu6Sn5 compound 
layer could either be caused by the thermal 
annealing process or by electromigration 
effect. To identify the major root-cause of the 
Ag3Sn compound formation, Sn5Ag/Cu 
samples were annealed at 130 ℃ for 500 and 
1000 h. Fig. 5 shows SEM cross-sectional 
images of the thermal annealed Sn5Ag/Cu 
samples. The Ag3Sn compound phase did not

stressing through the solder joint interface can 
be achieved. Figs. 5 (a)-(d) show SEM 
cross-sectional images of Sn5Ag/Cu bumps 
with different current densities after 5 h of 
current-stressing time at 130 ℃. Regardless of 
the current density, there was distinct 
formation of the Ag3Sn compound on the 
interfacial Cu6Sn5 layer for all Sn5Ag/Cu 
bumps. As mentioned previously in Fig. 6 
(a)-(b), due to the formation of Ag3Sn 
compound layer, we can observe no obvious 
EM-induced Cu consumption. Yet, in Figs. 6 
(c)-(d), with a relatively high current density, 
EM-induced Cu consumption can be clearly 
observed beneath the Cu6Sn5 compound layer. 
The above results imply that the EM-induced 
Cu consumption could be retarded by the 
Ag3Sn compound formation, particularly, in 
the low current density (less than 5000 A/cm2). 
This finding seems to agreeing with the result 
by Ebersberger et al. [28]. They found that 
while Sn-Ag solder bumps were stressed at 
the low current density (less than 5000 A/cm2), 
the EM lifetime of SnAg solder bump 
approaches to the lifetime of SnAg solder 
bump under HTS (high temperature storage) 
test, i.e., without stressing with current. 
However, literature refers EM failure in 
Sn-Ag bumps under the current density less 
than 5000 A/cm2 [29]. One of the major 
reasons for no EM failure observed under low 
current density regime in the present study 
could be that the current EM test structure 
does not incorporate current crowding effects 
during EM test. Thick Cu pads were used in 
the present study, which helps the current 
flowing evenly through the solder/Cu pad 
interface. On the other hand, the current 
crowding would occur in the real flip-chip 
Sn-Ag bumps.

joints on Cu foils after 5 h current stressing

A/cm2; (d) 20000 A/cm2 
 
(II) The Sn(Cu)/ENIG system: 
Fig. 7 shows SEM cross-sectional images 
of the as-jointed Sn0.2Cu solder bumps on the 
Ni(P) bond pad. The interfacial compound 
layer of the Sn0.2Cu sample was determined 
to be the Ni3Sn4 phase by FE-EPMA, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a1). As stated, when the 
10 
 
phase below Ni3P layer is the ternary 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 phase, which contains 31.4 at.% 
Cu, 22.1 at.% Ni and 46.4 at.% Sn analyzed 
with EPMA.

stressed Sn0.2Cu/ENIG interfaces at 150 °C 
for (a) as-reflowed (b) 50 h (c) 120 h (d) 220 
h. 
 
Fig. 9(c1) shows SEM cross-sectional 
images of the as-jointed  
Sn1Cu solder bumps on the Ni(P) bond pad. 
The interfacial compound phase at the joint 
interface is the ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound 
with a layer-type morphology. Figs. 
9(c2)-9(c4) show SEM cross-sectional images 
of the current-stressed Sn1Cu/ENIG solder 
joints at 150 °C.  After 50 h of current 
stressing, the morphology of the interfacial 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound was transformed into a 
needle-like structure. A Ni3P formation was 
not detected beneath the ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 
compound layer. After 120 h of current 
stressing, the appearance of the interfacial 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound layer transformed into 
scallop-shaped grains. With a prolonged 
current stressing time of 220 h, the Ni(P) layer 
was completely consumed; however, there 
was only a minor formation of the Ni3P layer.

current stressed Sn1Cu/ENIG interfaces at

One of the major reasons for no EM failure 
observed under low current density regime in 
the present study could be that the current EM 
test structure does not incorporate current 
crowding effects during EM test. Thick Cu 
pads were used in the present study, which 
helps the current flowing evenly through the 
solder/Cu pad interface. On the other hand, 
the current crowding would occur in the real 
flip-chip Sn-Ag bumps. 
 
(II) The Sn(Cu)/ENIG system: 
Fig. 11 shows the Ni atomic fluxes along 
the current stressing across the cathode joint 
interface. J1 is the EM Ni atomic flux from the 
Ni(P) layer to the interfacial compound layer. 
J2 is the EM Ni atomic flux from the 
interfacial compound layer to the Sn(Cu) 
solder matrix. J3 is the EM Ni atomic in the 
Sn(Cu) solder matrix. With reference to Fig. 
11, the following presents a discussion on 
three EM behaviors at the cathode joint 
interfaces of Sn(Cu)/ENIG interfaces. 
 
Fig. 11: Ni atomic fluxes along the current 
stressing across the cathode joint interface. 
 
(a) EM-induced dissolution at the interfacial 
compound layers: 
From the SEM cross-sectional results of 
the Sn0.2Cu sample shown in Figs. 
7(a1)-7(a4), with the current stressing time 
increased, increased depletion of the 
interfacial Ni3Sn4 phase at the joint interface 
was observed. After 50 h of current stressing, 
the interfacial Ni3Sn4 compound phase was 
significantly depleted. No interfacial Ni3Sn4 
compound phase was observed after 120 h of 
current stressing. The inference drawn is that 
the consumption of the Ni3Sn4 phase at the 
joint interface is likely under current stressing. 
After the interfacial Ni3Sn4 phase at the joint 
interface was depleted, the Ni atoms began to 
be forced out of the Ni(P) layer and into the 
solder matrix. Evidence for depletion of Ni in 
the Ni(P) layer was the formation of the Ni3P 
layer, and is referred to as EM-induced Ni 
dissolution. For the mechanism of the 
EM-induced dissolution in the metal bond pad, 
please refer to the cited reference [32]. As 
shown in Figs. 7(a3) and 7(a4), the 
EM-induced dissolved Ni atoms were 
observed to accumulate in the solder near the 
cathode interface and formed a large 
concentration of the Ni3Sn4 phase. The 
inference drawn from this observation (the 
large concentration of the Ni3Sn4 phase near 
the cathode interface) is that, under current 
stressing, the rate of the EM Ni atomic flux in 
the solder matrix is moderately low and is 
smaller than the EM-induced Ni dissolution, 
that is, J2. From this analysis, it is concluded 
that, among the three EM Ni atomic fluxes (J1, 
J2, and J3), J2 is the fastest and J3 is the slowest 
in the Sn0.2Cu/ENIG case. 
For the Sn0.7Cu/ENIG case, as shown in 
Fig. 8, the interfacial ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 
compound layer remained at the joint interface 
after 120 h of current stressing. After 220 h of 
current stressing, disappearance of the 
interfacial ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound 
14 
 
ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound layer remained 
at the interface during the EM effect; hence, 
the Ni(P) consumption rate from the 
interfacial ternary (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound 
layer into the Sn0.2Cu solder was controlled 
by the EM-induced Ni dissolution. The slope 
of the Sn1Cu/ENIG curve represents the 
dissolution rate (0.018 μm/h) of the interfacial 
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound into the Sn1Cu solder. 
For the Sn0.7Cu/ENIG case, phase 
transformation occurred at the interfacial 
compound layer, and indicates a complex 
kinetic mechanism for the Ni(P) consumption 
process.

本計畫為三年期的國科會計畫，本計畫從 99年 8月份執行至今已有豐碩的成果，關於
本計畫內容(無鉛銲料中微量成分(如:金,銀,銦,銅)之電遷移行為)，本實驗室近三年來已投稿
多篇國際期刊且被接受 26篇。 
在第一年的研究成果中，我們發現一個可以抑制電遷移效應誘發銅墊層消耗的新穎現
象，在特定電流密度條件測試下，銀(Ag)原子在電遷移效應下會逆電子流方向移動，同時
在陰極端 Sn5Ag/Cu 界面上形成 Ag3Sn 的化合物層，並且得到初步的實驗證實。此一現象
對現今產業界有極大的幫助，錫銀二元合金系統(Sn-Ag binary alloy system)的共晶成分是
96.5Sn-3.5Ag(wt.%)，其共晶溫度為 221 ℃，較錫鉛共晶溫度(183 ℃)約高 38 ℃。此合金冷
卻後之微觀組織為細顆粒之 Ag3Sn介金屬化合物，均勻分散在 β-Sn相的周圍，因為具有分
散強化的機制，所以錫銀合金之機械性質一般較優於傳統錫鉛合金。如果錫銀二元合金系
統其中的銀(Ag)原子在電遷移效應下會逆電子流方向移動，那錫銀合金對於銲點接點的可
靠度價值更加提升。 
在第二年的研究成果中，我們針對 Ni(P) bond-pads和錫球銲料的接點上通以電流密度
高達 104 A/cm2的電遷移測試，從中發現大量的 Ni(P)消耗和不尋常的電遷移效應誘發介金
屬 Ni3Sn4擴散的新穎現象。然而，當於 Ni(P)層上再鍍上一層無電鍍 Pd層時，上述提及的
兩種現象皆會被有效的抑制。此種抑制電遷移的效應皆得到初步的實驗證實。此一現象對
現今產業界有極大的幫助，針對無電鍍鎳金層(ENIG)和無電鍍鎳鈀層(ENEPIG)兩者作電遷
移測試的探討中發現，在無電鍍鎳金層(ENIG)系統，電遷移效應加速 Ni原子的擴散，因而
造成大量的 Ni(P)層消耗，另一方面也發現原先在界面上的介金屬層 Ni3Sn4有剝離(spalling)
的現象，這些都是電遷移效應促進 Ni原子擴散的表徵。在無電鍍鎳鈀層(ENEPIG)系統中，
前面所提及的現象皆完全被抵制，針對此點我們推論是因為界面上介金屬 PdSn4 或三元的
Ni3Sn4溶 Pd的產生，有效的抑制了 Ni原子的擴散，進而抑制了電遷移效應。 
    在第三年的研究成果中，我們針對無電鍍鎳金層(ENIG)/Sn-xCu銲料銲點系統之電遷移

Abstract: 
    Upon current-stressing a Cu/Sn cathode joint interface, the Cu atoms in the 
Cu-Sn compound layer would experience two major driving forces, which are EM 
force and difference of Cu chemical potential in the Cu-Sn compound layer and in the 
Sn solder with deficient Cu solubility.  Both forces would simultaneously result in 
Cu dissolution fluxes from the Cu-Sn compound layer into the Sn joint.  In this 
study, we design a special T-shape solder joint structure to separate this two driving 
force of EM-induced Cu dissolution in Cu-Sn compound.  The current work has 
demonstrated that the EM-induced deficient Cu solubility in Sn solder is the dominant 
driving force for the dissolution in the cathode Cu-Sn compound layer under current 
density of 104 A/cm2 at 150 ℃.

Abstract: 
 Patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) is a trend for the high-power GaN-based 
LEDs.   In the past, most PSS researches focus on the effect of PSS pattern on the 
external quantum efficiency, EQE, which includes lighting extraction efficiency and 
internal quantum efficiency.  However, the research of the effect of the pattern 
morphology (ex: the shapes of pattern features, the pattern coverage, and the incline 
angle of the pattern facets) on the light emission pattern has not been addressed 
extensively.   
 In this study, nature patterned-sapphire substrates (n-PSS) were produced by a 
mask-free wet-etching process.  By varying the etching parameters, different pattern 
morphology can be created.  Then, MOCVD GaN LED epitaxial layers were grown 
on those n-PSS wafers.  1x1 cm high-power horizontal LED chips were fabricated 
on the n-PSS epi-wafers.  Firstly, the light emitting patterns of To-caned LEDs on 
different PSS epi-wafers were measured.   Based on the preliminary results, we 
found that the pattern coverage (i.e., the pattern size) would promote the directionality 
of the light pattern.  On the other words, the light pattern in the lateral direction 
decreases with the pattern coverage.  In addition, we notice that the light patterns of 
the LEDs on different n-PSS wafers were found to be greatly affected by the shapes of 
the pattern features on PSS.  We will discuss the effect of the shapes of the pattern 
features on the light pattern in this talk.  Besides the light pattern, the light output 
Heat spreading improvement on thin-GaN Light-Emitting Diodes by using 
diamond-like carbon passivation layer

Abstract 
    It is known that the heat spots (i.e., non-uniform temperature distribution) on the 
horizontal high-power light emitting diode (LED) cause poor heat dissipation 
efficiency.  To improve the temperature distribution and thermal dissipation of the 
high-power LED chip, the thin-GaN LED structure was developed.  The key feature 
of the thin-GaN LED is that the GaN epi-layer is stripped from the original sapphire 
substrate and transferred onto the thermal conduction substructure, such as, Cu or Si 
substrates.  Previous researches show that the thermal conduction substrate 
underneath the GaN epi-layers can improve the temperature distribution on the LED 
chip.  Yet, the current crowding occurred due to the limited size of the top n-GaN 
electrode would still result in non-uniform temperature distribution on the thin-GaN 
LED chip.   
 Currently, the passivation layer on the n-GaN surface is fabricated by SiO2 thin 
film, which has a relatively low thermal conductivity (0.014 W/cm-degK at 300 K).  
So, in this work, we replace the SiO2 passivation layer on the n-GaN surface with 
diamond-like carbon (DLC) thin film.  DLC thin film is an amorphous film 
consisting both sp2 and sp3 C-C bonding, which has a high thermal conductivity close 
to the thermal conductivity of the diamond thin film.  In addition, it also has a good 
adhesion on various substrates.  The DLC passivation layer provides a good thermal 
spreading path to unify the heat spots generated by the current crowding due to the 
limited n-pad on the n-GaN surface.  In this talk, a comparison study would be 
conducted between the thin-GaN LEDs with either SiO2 or DCL passivation layers on 
the n-GaN surface.  The light-current-voltage (L-I-V) curves of the thin-GaN LEDs 
with either SiO2 or DCL passivation layers would be characterized.  Also, the 
junction temperature of the thin-GaN LEDs with either SiO2 or DCL passivation layer 
would be measured to evaluate the heat-spreading performance of the DLC 
passivation layer on the thin-GaN LEDs.
