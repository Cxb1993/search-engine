Abstract 
This project studies admission control of a 
unreliable station when arrivals are internal.  
Since arrivals are internal, the system controller 
needs to reroute the rejected job to other stations.  
Under admission control at arrival epochs, a job 
will know whether it is accepted or rejected by a 
station only at its arrival epoch, and the system 
controller may need to try several stations before 
it finds one that will accept the job.  To make 
the job routing easier for such system, we move 
the admission control epochs from arrival  
epochs to departure epochs and delegate the 
server the task of switching on or off the arrival 
stream by setting up a sign indicating the 
admission status of its station.   Thus an 
upstream station will have information of the 
admission status of all its downstream stations 
and can route its job to a station that will accept 
its job.  We prove that when failure of a server 
is caused by a cumulative shock process, the 
optimal admission policy at departure epochs 
has monotonic switch curve structure.

Admission Control of a Unreliable Service Station under at
service completion epoch

1 Introduction
The main concern of most studies in the admission control of a service station is on how to
adjust its input ﬂow to reduce station congestion level and ﬂow times. Very often the control
of input ﬂow of a station is implemented at arrival epochs via accepting or rejecting a job. Past
studies ([2],[5],[6],[8],[12]) indicate that the optimal admission policy is of control limit type:
reject the job when number of jobs in the station exceeds a certain control limit and accept
the job otherwise. Such control can be implemented by setting queue capacity of the station
to be the control limit and the implementation of the optimal control is easy. All the studies
above assume that the service station does not fail. Obviously, this assumption does not hold
in real applications. When the server is subject to a cumulative shocks failure process, [3]
proves that the optimal admission policy at arrival epochs is still of control limit type for
M/M/1 queue and the optimal admission control limit is such that the controller rejects more
arrival when the state of the server deteriorates more. To implement the admission policy
for such unreliable queue, we need to adjust the queue capacity of the station according to
the deterioration state of the server and the implementation of the optimal policy is more
troublesome.
On the other hand studies in the admission control often assume that the arrivals to
the station are external to the system and thus do not concern themselves about destinies
of the rejected jobs. When sources of arrivals of the service station are internal, such as
departures from stations upstream the target service station, under the admission control
at the arrival epochs mechanism, the upstream stations have to compete for service/waiting

2 Problem description and formulation
The service station is modeled as a M/G/1 queue with a server that deteriorates with usage
and eventually fails. Server failures are caused by a cumulative shock process imposing on the
server while the server is busy. The shock stream is a stationary point process and each shock
brings in an independently and identically distributed (iid) amount of damage to the server.
Damages on a server are cumulative. When the cumulated damage to a server exceeds a
random threshold, the server fails. This kind of failure process is commonly used in modeling
fatigue failures of mechanical part ([7][10][11]). To capture the state of the server, it would
be best if we can monitor the cumulated damage on the server. To achieve this, the server
should be equipped with some complicated device to measure the cumulated damage. This
is impossible to achieve in practice ([1]). If the server is equipped with some counter which
records the number of shocks that the server experienced since new, we will have information
on the cumulated damage on the server. In practice, unless the consequence of a server failure
is catastrophic or the shock count is used as an input for the processing of a job, not too
many servers are designed with this feature. Thus, we assume that the design of the server is
such that neither the cumulated damage nor the shock count that the server experienced are
monitored and the only piece of information we have on the deterioration state of a server is
number of services it has completed since new. Since the shock stream is a stationary point
process, damages caused by each shock are iid and processing times are iid; the incremental
damages incurred in each service are also iid. Let the incremental damage during a service
time be a. When the accumulated damage exceeds a random threshold value D, a failure
occurs. Let rk be the conditional probability of having a failure in the next service time given
that the server has operated k services since new without failure at the start of a service.
Then rk = P (
∑k+1
j=1 aj ≥ D |
∑k
j=1 aj < D) and is nondecreasing in k. It is logic to deﬁne the
deterioration state of a server, k, as the number of service completions it experienced since
new.
Assume that failures are detected at the service completion epochs. When a failure is
detected, the server is minimally repaired. Minimal repair restores the state of the server
to the state right before failure. If the state of the server is k at the start of a service and
the server fails during this service, then after minimal repair, the state of the server becomes
k + 1. After minimal repair, the job under service when server fails restarts its processing
3
Y : Minimal repair time.
Z : Preventive maintenance time.
rk : Probability of a server fails during a service given that the state of the server is k at
the start of a service.
h : Holding cost rate per job per unit time.
R : Random reward collected at the arrival epoch.
3 Discounted cost
Let Ci(m, k) and Co(m, k) be the expected one stage holding costs given that the state is
(m, k) and we choose to turn on and oﬀ arrival stream, respectively. Denote W (t) as the
distribution function of a random variable W . Then
Ci(m, k) = E{
∫ ∞
0
e−αth(m + N (t))dX(t)}+ rkE{e−αX
∫ ∞
0
e−αth(m + N (X))dY (t)}
Co(m, k) = E{
∫ ∞
0
e−αthmdX(t)}+ rkE{e−αX
∫ ∞
0
e−αthmdY (t)}
Let Vn(m, k) be the optimal value function when there are n decision epochs remaining and
the system state is (m, k). In(m, k)(On(m, k)) is the value function when there are n decision
epochs remaining and we choose to turn on (turn oﬀ) the arrival stream given that the system
state is (m, k). Pn(0, k)(Nn(m, k)) is the value function when there are n decision epochs
remaining and we choose to conduct (not to conduct) the preventive maintenance on the
server given that the system state is (0, k). Then, the dynamic programming recursion of
this SMDP is
Vn(m, k) = min{In(m, k), On(m, k)}, m ≥ 1, k = 0, 1, 2 . . .
Vn(0, k) = min{Pn(0, k), Nn(0, k)} k = 0, 1, 2 . . .
V0(m, k) = 0 m ≥ 0, k = 0, 1, 2 . . .
where
In(m, k) = Ci(m, k)−E[R(X)]+ E[Un(m +N (X), k)]
On(m, k) = Co(m, k) + Un(m, k)
Un(m, k) = E{e−αX [(1− rk)Vn−1((m− 1)+, k + 1) + rkE{e−αY Vn−1(m, k + 1)]}
Pn(0, k) = E(e−α(Z+T )Vn−1(1, 0))

equations for this inﬁnite horizon discounted SMDP and the extension of the result of the
ﬁnite horizon problem to the inﬁnite horizon problem. Assumption 1 ensures that there is
no inﬁnite number of transitions occuring in any ﬁnite interval. Since P (T = 0) < 1 and
X > 0, assumption 1 is satisﬁed. To prove assumption 3, which is Vα(m, k) < ∞ for all m
and α, consider the policy, π which keeps the arrival process oﬀ always and always conduct
preventive maintenance at the end of busy periods. Then, the value function under policy
π, Vα,π(m, k) < ∞ for all m. Since Vα,π(m, k) ≥ Vα(m, k), assumption 3 is satisﬁed. Hence,
there exists a Vα(m, k), the optimal value function of the inﬁnite horizon discounted problem,
satisfying
Vα(m, k) = min{Iα(m, k), Oα(m, k)}, m ≥ 1, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Vα(0, k) = min{Pα(0, k), Nα(0, k)} k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where
Iα(m, k) = Ci(m, k)− E(R(X))+ Uα(m +N (X), k)
Oα(m, k) = Co(m, k)Uα(m, k)
Uα(m, k) = E{e−αX [(1− rk)Vα((m− 1)+, k + 1) + rkE{e−αY Vα(m, k + 1)]}
Pα(0, k) = E{e−α(Z+T )Vα(1, 0)}
Nα0, k) = E{e−αTVα(1, k)}
The policy which attains the maximum at the optimality equations is the optimal policy. To
extend the structure of the optimal policy from ﬁnite horizon to inﬁnite horizon, we need to
prove that Vn(m, k) converges to Vα(m, k) as n approaches inﬁnity.
Lemma 1 If Co(0, 0) + C(1) − ER(X) ≥ 0 then Vn(m, k) is nondecreasing in n and ap-
proaches to a limit Vα(m, k) as n approaches inﬁnity.
proof : When Co(0, 0) + C(1) − ER(X) ≥ 0, Co(m, k) + C(k) − ER(X) ≥ 0 for all m ≥
1, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Thus
V1(m, k) = min{Ci(m, k), Co(m, k)} = min{C(k)−ER(X), 0}+ Co(m, k) ≥ 0 = V0(m, k)
V1(0, k) = 0
7
U ′n(m, k) = E{e−αX [(1− rk)V ′n−1((m− 1)+, k + 1) + rkE{e−αY V ′n−1(m, k + 1)]}
P ′n(0, k) = E(e
−α(Z+T )V ′n−1(1, 0))
N ′n(0, k) = E(e
−αTV ′n−1(1, k))
This set of DP recursion will give us the same optimal policy as the original one. To derive
the condition of “always oﬀ” policy, we will work on this set of DP recursions: Since c(k) is
nondecreasing in k, E(R(X))< C(0) implies E(R(X))< C(k) for all k ≥ 0 m ≥ 1. At n = 1
V ′1(m, k) = min{c(m, k)− E(R(X)), 0}
Since c(m, k)−E(R(X)) > 0, we choose to turn oﬀ the arrival stream . Hence V ′1(m, k) = 0
and “oﬀ” is optimal at n = 1 for all m ≥ 1 and k ≥ 0. Now by induction, we have “oﬀ” is
optimal for all n ≥ 1 and all m. 
4 Average cost
To extend the results of the discounted reward to the average reward case, we need to prove
that the 5 assumptions listed in [9] are satisﬁed here. In Section 3, we prove that assumptions
1 and 3 are satisﬁed. E(T ) < ∞ ensures that assumption 2 is satisﬁed. It is obvious that
the mean ﬁrst passage time from a state (m, k) to state (1, 0) under policy π deﬁned in
Section 3 is ﬁnite; hence, assumption 4 is satisﬁed. Finally, in Section 3, we proved that
Vn(m, k) is nonincreasing in m and k, and Vα(m, k) = limn→∞ Vn(m, k). Thus, Vα(m, k) is
also nondecreasing in m and k, and assumption 5 is satisﬁed. The action space is ﬁnite, thus
for any sequence of discount factors {αn} decreasing to 0, there is a subsequence {βn} of {αn},
numbers k¯ and m(k), such that limn→∞mβn(k) = m(k) and limn→∞ kβn = k¯. Let policy Ψ
be the policy determined by the control limit m(k) at state (m, k), m ≥ 1, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
and k¯ at state (0, k), k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. From any initial state (m, k), the semi-Markov process
induced by policy Ψ eventually reaches positive recurrent states (1,0). By [9] we have
Theorem 6 Under policy Ψ, there exist a constant g and a function H(m, k) with M(m, k) ≥
H(m, k) ≥ −N , where N and M(m, k) are as deﬁned in [9], satisfying
g[E(X)+ rkE(Y )] +H(m, k) ≥ ci(m, k)− E(R)E(X)
E(T )
+ (1− rk)E(H(m+N (X)− 1, k + 1))

vn(m, k) = Vn(m, k)−EV (m+ N (X), k)−C(k)
Note that On(m, k)−In(m, k) = Un(m, k)−EU(m+N (X), k)−C(k)+ER(X) = un(m, k)+
ER(X). If un(m, k) is nonincreasing in m for ﬁxed k, we have the result. To prove this , we
consider the following statements:
(A1): Un(m, k) is nonnegative and nondecreasing in m.
(A2): un(m, k) is nonincreasing in m.
(B1): Vn(m, k) is nonnegative and nondecreasing in m.
(B2): vn(m, k) is nonincreasing in m.
(C1): Un+1(m, k) is nonnegative and nondecreasing in m.
(C2): un+1(m, k) is nonincreasing in m
We will show that (A1) and (A2) imply (B1) and (B2), and (B1) and (B2) imply (C1) and
(C2). To start the induction, at n = 0, U0(m, k) = 0 and u0(m, k) = −C(k). Thus (A1) and
(A2) are true at n = 0. Assume that (A1) and (A2) are true at n. By (A1) and (A2) we
have for all m ≥ 1
Vn(m, k) = Un(m, k) + (un(m, k)− ER(X))−
=
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
Un(m, k)− un(m, k) + ER(X) if un(m, k)−ER(X) < 0
Un(m, k) if un(m, k)−ER(X) ≥ 0
where (a)− = −min(a, 0). (B1) is proved. To prove (B2), note that
vn(m, k) = Vn(m, k)−E(Vn(m +N (X), k))− C(k)
= [Un(m, k) + (un(m, k)− ER(X))−]
−E[Un(m +N (X), k)+ (un(m+ N (X), k)− ER(X ′))−)]− C(k)
= {Un(m, k)− E(Un(m +N (X), k)− C(k) + (un(m, k)− ER(X))−}
−E[(un(m+ N (X), k)−ER(X ′))−]
where variables X and X ′ are two independent service times. If un(m, k) − ER(X) ≥ 0,
then the terms in {} becomes Un(m, k)−E(Un(m+N (X), k)−C(k) = un(m, k), otherwise,
it becomes ER(X). Thus, the terms in {} can be combined into max{E(R(X)), un(m, k)}
which is nonincreasing in m. Next we need to prove that the last term −E[(un(m+N (X), k)−
ER(X ′))−] is nonincreasing in m. Note that if N (X) = l, then E[(un(m + l, k)− ER(X ′))
can be < 0 or = 0 or > 0. Since un(m, k) is nonincreasing in m, there exist a l(k) such that
11
F4 = E{e−αX ′rkE(e−αY E(Vn(m+N (X), k+1))}−E{e−αX ′rkE(e−αY Vn(m+N (X), k+1))}
then un+1(m) = F1 + F2 + F3 + F4. By (B2) F1 is nonincreasing in m. F2 is independent of
m thus is nonincreasng in m. For m ≥ 1
F3 = E{e−αX ′(1−rk)EVn(m−1+N (X), k+1)}−E{e−αX ′(1−rk)Vn(m+N (X)−1, k+1)}
= E(e−αX
′
)(1−rk)EVn(m−1+N (X), k+1)−E(e−αX ′)(1−rk)EVn(m+N (X)−1, k+1) = 0
Similarly,F4 = 0, thus un+1(m) is nonincreasing in m. 
Proof of Theorem 3: When Y = 0, C(k) = E{∫∞0 e−αthN (t)dX(t)} is independent of
k and is denoted as C. If un(m, k) is nonincreasing in k for ﬁxed m, we have the result. To
prove this , we consider the following statements:
(A): un(m, k) is nonincreasing in k
(B): vn(m, k) is nonincreasing in k.
(C): un+1(m, k) is nonincreasing in k
We will show that (A) imply (B), and (B) imply (C). To start the induction, at n = 0
u0(m, k) = −C. Thus, (A) is true at n = 0. Assume that (A) is true at n. As noted in the
proof of Theorem 2 that
vn(m, k) = max{E(R(X)), un(m, k)}−E[(un(m +N (X), k)−ER(X ′))−]
We need to prove that the last term −E[(un(m + N (X), k)− ER(X ′))−] is nonincreasing
in k. Since un(m, k) is nonincreasing in m, there exist a l(k) such that E[(un(m + l, k) −
ER(X ′))− > 0 if l ≥ l(k) and E[(un(m+ l, k)−ER(X ′))−] = 0 if l(k) ≥ l. Let l(k, k+ 1) =
min{l(k), l(k+ 1)}. Then
−E[(un(m + l, k)−ER(X ′))−] = −
∞∑
l=l(k,k+1)
[−un(m+ l, k) + ER(X ′)]P (N (X) = l)
=
∞∑
l=l(k,k+1)
[un(m + l, k)−ER(X ′)]P (N (X) = l)

∞∑
l=l(k,k+1)
[un(m + l, k + 1)− ER(X ′)]P (N (X) = l) = −E[(un(m + l, k+ 1)− ER(X ′))]
Hence, vn(m, k) ≥ vn(m, k + 1). Next we prove (C).

Abstract: Manufacturing plants have many stations each having 
different maintenance requirements. Unless the stations are 
well maintained they will have increasing failure rates by time 
and degrade system throughput. Our decision support system 
helps maintenance supervisor scheduling preventive 
maintenance depending on stationsâ€™ remaining useful life 
and prioritizing repair of simultaneously failed stations.

Abstract
This paper ﬁnds the optimal economic production quantity and the optimal preventive
maintenance plan of a failure prone production system under the EPQ setting. Assume
that the production machine may fail and its failure, unobservable, causes the process
to shift from in-control to out-of-control. Because of inherent variability, the machine
may produce defective items even when it is in-control. Statistical process control is
implemented to detect machine failures. Expression of average cost per unit time is
derived based on renewal reward theorem and sensitivities of machine related parameters
on the minium average cost per unit time are investigated.
1 Introduction
Because of its easy implementation and inherent robustness, economic production quantity
(EPQ) is a popular tool for production planning and inventory control in the real world
applications. Beside constant demand rate and constant production rate assumptions, the
EPQ also assumes that the production machine never fails and all the outputs are nondefec-
tive. Many researchers worked on relaxing some EPQ assumptions to make it more realistic.
Groenevelt et al. (1992b) studies a multiperiod EPQ model with machine failures and as-
sumes that time to machine failure is exponentially distributed and repair time distribution
is of general distribution. Kim and Hong (1997) extends the model of Groenevelt et al.(1992)
and allows the time to machine failure to be a general distribution, however, they consider
only a single period model. Moini and Murthy (2000) studies one period EPQ model with
exponentially distributed time to machine failure and repair time. Cheung and Hausman
(1997) studies multiperiod production system with a production rate that barely meets the
1
quantity and optimal PM time. Section 4 concludes the paper.
2 Problem formulation
Consider a production system under the EPQ setting. Production runs are initiated whenever
inventory level drops to zero, thus the production process alternates between producing items
and not producing items. Deﬁne time between two consecutive production starts a production
cycle and the time in which the production machine engages in production in a production
cycle a production period. Let time till a machine failure be a random variable X assumed
to have increasing failure rate. To reduce the number of defective items produced, preventive
maintenance, implemented at the end of the production period of the V th (a decision variable)
production cycle is used to restore the machine to good as new state. Deﬁne a PM cycle
as V consecutive production cycles. The repair time S1 , a random variable, includes the
preparation time needed to collect the repairman, material and equipment required for repair
and time needed to restore the machine. Since PM is planned, the required repairman,
material and equipment should be ready when PM starts, we assume PM time S2 to be a
constant.
Under the original EPQ setting, the production machine starts production when the
inventory level drops to zero and stops production when the inventory reaches a certain level,
say Q. Here, the machine may fail during a production period and the repair time is random
and thus the system may run out of stock before the end of repair. When this happens, the
unsatisﬁed demand is lost and the system incurs a lost sale penalty cost and will start a new
production cycle at the end of repair. If the inventory level is positive at the end of repair, the
stopped production process will be restarted when these inventory is depleted. Similarly, if
inventory is depleted before PM is completed, a new production cycle will start at the end of
PM. If inventory level is positive at the end of PM, then a new production cycle will start as
soon as these inventory is depleted. Thus, each time when the system starts a new production
cycle with the machine state being good as new, the system renewals itself. Such epochs are
renewal epochs and constitute a renewal process. By renewal reward theorem, average cost
per unit time for such a system can be obtained by dividing the expected renewal cycle cost
by the expected renewal cycle length. The cost considered here include holding cost, lost sale
cost, item sampling cost, machine failure cost, machine repair cost, and machine inspection

h : sampling interval
X : machine lifetime, a random variable with distribution F (x)
S1 : repair time, a random variable with distribution G(y)
S2 : PM time, a constant
O : setup cost per production
M : machine failure cost
Ch : inventory holding cost per item per unit time
Cd : penalty cost per defective item found during sampling
CI : sampling cost per unit sampled
CM : machine inspection cost per inspection
CP : penalty cost for each defective item delivered to customers, CP > Cd
Cl : lost sale cost per unit demand unsatisﬁed
Cr : repair cost per unit time

Under the EPQ setting, a feasible production system must maintain a nonnegative in-
ventory incremental rate during production period. The inventory incremental rate during
a production period is Kh−dinK−DTˆ

= Kh−dinK−D
Kh
P
Kh/P = P − D − din Ph . Thus we assume
P > D1−din/h . To derive the expected renewal cycle cost and the expected renewal cycle
length, we need to consider six possible scenarios that can occur during a renewal cycle.
Case 1: No machine failure occurs before PM and inventory level is positive at the end of
PM. The renewal cycle ends when the inventory left at the end of PM is depleted. Case
2: No machine failure occurs before PM and inventory is depleted before PM is completed.
The renewal cycle ends at the end of PM. Case 3: Machine failure occurs before PM and is
not detected before PM. The renewal cycle ends when the inventory left at the end of PM
is depleted. Case 4: Machine failure occurs before PM and is not detected before PM. The

2.3 Case 3: Failure occurs before PM, not detected and nonnegative in-
ventory level at PM completion epoch
Deﬁne the production cycle where the failure occurs as failure production cycle. Conditioning
on the machine lifetime X = x, let N (x) be the number of production cycles before machine
failure, not including the failure production cycle. N (x) = 0, 1, 2, . . . , V − 1. Observe that
when nKhP < X < (n+ 1)
Kh
P , N (x) = n. Thus
P (N (x) = n | X ≤ V Tˆ ) =

nKh/p
dF (x) /
∫ V Tˆ
0
dF (x), n = 0, 1, . . . , V − 1
Given N (x) = n, we deﬁne the following related notations :
tn = x− nTˆ : the length of time from the start of failure production cycle till machine
failure epoch
Z = V − n : number of production cycles after machine failures till the end of PM cycle,
including the failure production cycle
Un : number of production cycles after machine failure till SPC detects process shift
Un = 0 indicates SPC detects process shift on the failure production cycle.
Un = 0, 1, 2, . . . , V − n− 1.
mn : number of samplings made in the failure production cycle counting from the start
of production till machine failure mn = 0, 1, 2, . . .K
Ln : number of sampling made from machine failure till SPC detects process shift
A(n,mn, Un) : time from which machine is stopped for repair till the inventory is depleted
N (x) = n, mn, Un
τn,u : detection delay, given N (x) = n, Un = u
To derive the expected renewal cycle length and renewal cycle cost under case 3, we
need to distinguish two subcases: (1)PM is implemented on the failure production cycle

3 Numerical studies
In this section, we conduct some numerical studies to investigate how the minimum average
cost ATC∗, optimal production quantity Q∗ = K∗h and optimal PM cycle V ∗ are aﬀected
by production machine parameters: mean lifetime E(X), mean repair time E(S1), failure
cost M , process mean when machine is out-of-control μout and PM time S2. We adopt
the data of Cheung and Hausman (1997) to set machine lifetime, X as a Gamma random
variable with α = 3 and β = 170, ( E(X) = αβ = 510) and to set repair time S1 as a
gamma random variable with α = 2, β = 4. For quality characteristics, W set mean and
standard deviation of the normally distributed as μin = 120, μout = 135 and σ = 8. Thus
din = 0.0013, dout = 0.1304, α = 0.0013 and β = 0.86964. Other parameters are set at
values: D = 0.5, P = 1, h = 5, O = 100, M = 300, Ch = 0.5, Cd = 4, CI = 2, CM =
5, CP = 10, CL = 8, Cr = 50 and CV = 10. The average cost per unit time is a very
complicated function of K and V , we use the commercial solver Mathematica to ﬁnd the K∗
and V ∗, we also compare ATC∗ and K∗ for systems with PM and without PM (i.e., V = ∞).
From Table 1 we observe that the optimal production quantity Q∗ = K∗h is not aﬀected by
19
• On the eﬀect of changes in mean repair time: As mean repair time increases, the optimal
PM cycle gets shorter , ATC∗ increases for both without PM and with PM cases and
the ATC* reduction percentage due to PM gets larger. The rates of increase are larger
for without PM case. Thus, not only PM reduces the ATC* but also diminish the eﬀect
of mean repair time on ATC*.
• On the eﬀect of changes in PM time: As PM time increases the optimal PM cycle
increases and ATC∗ increases. If we compare the eﬀect of change of mean repair time
and that of PM time on optimal PM cycle, we ﬁnd that optimal cycle time is more
sensitive to the change of PM time than that of the mean repair time.
Insert Table 2 here
Table 2: Rate of increase in ATC∗
Next we study the rate of increase in ATC∗ per unit increase in production machine param-
eters. Table 2 summarizes the result for both without PM and with PM cases. First note
that when there is PM, the eﬀects of change of each of these production machine parameters
on ATC∗ diminish. When there is no PM, changes in mean repair time has largest impact
on ATC∗, followed by μout. Thus, to reduce ATC∗ under without PM case, one should try
to reduce the mean repair time ﬁrst. When PM is implemented, PM time has largest impact
on ATC∗ followed by mean repair time.
4 Conclusion
Applying renewal reward theorem, this paper derives the average cost per unit time of the
EPQ model with unobservable machine failure, defective outputs, and SPC under PM policy.
Optimal production quantity, preventive maintenance time and minimum average cost per
unit time are found numerically. We found that the optimal production quantity is not
aﬀected by changes in machine parameters. Numerical studies also reveal that PM is eﬀective
in reducing minimum average cost per unit time and is most eﬀective when the system has
small mean lifetime,large failure cost , large mean repair time and large process mean when
system is out-of-control. In addition, when there PM is not implemented, to reduce minimum
