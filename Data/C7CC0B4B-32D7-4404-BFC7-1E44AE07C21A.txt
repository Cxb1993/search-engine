by Wolff and Fleeter [3], nonlinear effects were 
quite likely to be associated with larger 
amplitudes of blade oscillation as well as 
unsteady transonic flows with shock motion 
induced by oscillating blades at small amplitudes.  
In recent years, a number of Euler [3-9] and 
Navier-Stokes [8-12] solvers have been presented 
to simulate the blade vibration problems. On a 
quadrilateral-triangular mesh, Hwang and Yang 
[6] presented a rigid-deformable dynamic mesh 
algorithm to investigate transonic flows around 
an oscillating cascade of four blades.  The 
time-accurate Euler/Navier-Stokes analysis [8] 
using NPHASE code [9] was applied, and 
computed results were compared with those 
based on linearized code [13]. Recently, 
experiments had been carried out to enhance the 
understanding of turbulent flows over vibrating 
blades with interblade phase angles [15-19].  
As mentioned by Sheng et al. [20], the biggest 
advantage of the unstructured grid approach over 
the structured grid approach was that the process 
of grid generation for complex geometries was 
greatly simplified. Also mentioned by Mavriplis 
[21], unstructured grid techniques offered the 
potential for greatly reducing the grid generation 
time associated with complex geometries.  
Furthermore, unstructured mesh approaches 
enabled the use of adaptive meshing techniques 
[22-24], which held great promise for increasing 
solution accuracy at minimal additional 
computational cost.  In the author’s previous 
study [25], a refining error indicator in which 
unified magnitudes of dynamic grid speed, 
substantial derivative of pressure, and substantial 
derivative of vorticity magnitude were 
incorporated to study inviscid transonic flows over 
vibrating blades with interblade phase angles. The 
locally implicit scheme was originally developed 
by Reddy and Jacock [26] on structured 
quadrilaterals. This scheme is locally implicit, 
but globally explicit. Hwang and Liu [27] 
developed the locally implicit scheme and 
anisotropic dissipation model on triangular mesh. 
In the author’s previous study [25], the locally 
implicit scheme and anisotropic dissipation 
model were developed on the mixed 
quadrilateral-triangular mesh for inviscid flow 
calculations.  In this study, the locally implicit 
scheme and anisotropic dissipation model are 
extended for turbulent flow calculations on 
dynamic adaptive meshes. As far as the 
turbulence model is concerned, the 
low-Reynolds-number k-ε turbulence model 
proposed by Abe et al. [28] is adopted.  This 
model was modified from the 
low-Reynolds-number k-ε turbulence model of 
Nagano and Tagawa [29]. 
 There are two objectives in the present study: 
(1) To develop a locally implicit scheme with an 
anisotropic dissipation model on dynamic 
adaptive meshes for turbulent flow calculations; 
and (2) To investigate turbulent flows over 
vibrating blades with interblade phase angle on 
dynamic adaptive meshes.

 To solve Eq. (6), a locally implicit scheme [25, 
26, 32] is implemented.   
3.2 Dynamic Adaptive Algorithm 
As far as the dynamic adaptive solver on 
unstructured meshes is concerned, the author had 
developed a refining error indicator in his 
previous Euler calculations [25], where unified 
magnitudes of dynamic grid speed, substantial 
derivative of pressure, and substantial derivative 
of vorticity magnitude were incorporated to 
study inviscid transonic flows over vibrating 
blades with interblade phase angles equal to 90 
deg as well as -90 deg. The error indicator in the 
previous Euler calculations [25] was formulated 
as

where Dt
Dp
, Dt
Dω
 and gV
v
 are the 
absolute values of the substantial derivative of 
pressure, substantial derivative of vorticity 
magnitude, and velocity vector of dynamic grid 
respectively. maxDt

, maxDt
Dω
 and maxgV
v
 are the 
maximum values of Dt
Dp
 , Dt
Dω
 and gV
v
 
among all the computational cells respectively. 
Since the order of magnitude of Dt
Dω
 
outnumbers those of Dt
Dp
 and gV
v
, it is 
essential to adjust all at the same order. Hence, 
Dt
Dp

 are divided by maxDt

, 
maxDt

 respectively. 1β and 2β  
represent the weighted coefficients. For the 
calculations of transonic flows over vibrating 
blades, 1β and 2β  are set to be 2.0 and 1.0 
respectively.   
In this project, the error indicator in Equation 
(7) is further improved to account for the viscous 
effect. The present error indicator is formulated 
as

Dωβ  is the absolute value of the 
substantial derivative of weighted vorticity 
magnitude. Ywall is the minimum distance 
between the computing cell and the vibrating 
blade surface, C is the chord length of the 
vibrating blade.  β* represents the weighted 
function.  The purpose of imposing β* in 
Equation (8) is to counteract the effect that the 
value of DtDω  increases abruptly as it 
approaches the boundary layer, especially in the 
viscous sublayer. 
  As for the two-level refinement technique, 
 6
by the following relation 
α=α0+αIsin(2Mkτ+mσ)              (9) 
where α, α0, αI, M, k, τ and σ represent 
instantaneous angle of attack, mean flow angle of 
attack, oscillation amplitude, inlet Mach number, 
reduced frequency, nondimensionalized time 
scale and interblade phase angle, respectively.  
The blade number m=0, 1, 2 and 3 represent each 
blade from the lowest to the highest one, 
respectively. On the initial 
quadrilateral-triangular mesh (Fig. 3), a layer of 
O-typed quadrilaterals is generated around each 
blade surface to match the experimental 
geometry [40], where the leading and trailing 
edges are rounded with a small radius of 
curvature (0.33% of chord length). After creating 
the quadrilaterals, the unstructured triangles are 
distributed elsewhere according to the mesh 
generation technique [41]. This 
quadrilateral-triangular mesh contains 17134 
cells and 12923 nodes.   
As for the case with σ, k , α0 and αI equal to 
-90 deg, 1.0, 7deg and 3.0 deg respectively, 
instantaneous adaptive meshes and pressure 
contours during the sixth cycle ((2MKτ-10π)=0, 
π/2) are plotted in Figs. 4-5. After comparing the 
instantaneous adaptive meshes (Figs. 4a and 4b) 
and pressure contours (Figs. 5a and 5b), it is 
observed that the flow behaviors repeat and 
proceed one pitch distance in the upward 
direction for quarter time period.  From the 
results given in Figs. 4a and 5a, a shock on the 
upper surface of the second blade and a shock on 
the front protion of upper surface of the lowest 
blade come into view. Within the passage 
between the third and highest blades, a shock is 
depicted, whose strength is strong enough to 
choke the flowfield.  Meanwhile, two shocks in 
front of the highest blade and on the lower 
surface of the second blade are also observed, 
respectively.  
4.3 Conclusions 
A locally implicit scheme with an 
anisotropic dissipation model on dynamic 
adaptive quadrilateral-triangular meshes is 
presented to simulate turbulent flows over 
vibrating blades with interblade phase angle. As 
indicated in the instantaneous adaptive meshes 
and pressure contours, flow behaviors repeat and 
proceed one pitch distance in the upward 
direction for every quarter time period when 
interblade phase angle is equal to -90 deg.  The 
unsteady pressure wave and shock wave 
phenomena of turbulent flows over vibrating 
blades with interblade phase angle are 
demonatrated and discussed.

六、計畫成果自評： 
After completing this project, four major 
items have been achieved and stated as follows. 
1. In this project, the dynamic adaptive 
solver on unstructured 
quadrilateral-triangular meshes has been 
developed to study turbulent flows over 
vibrating blades with arbitrary 
interblade phase angles.  This approach 
enables both researchers and engineers 
to efficiently as well as accurately 
investigate vibrating blade flow 
problems encountered in 
turbomachinery.  It benefits the 
development as well as upgrades of 
industries related to turbomachinery, 
and our national development also 
benefits from the upgrade of industries.  
2. Unstructured mesh techniques offer the 
potential for greatly reducing the grid 
generation time associated with complex 
geometries.  Furthermore, unstructured 
mesh approaches enable the use of 
adaptive meshing techniques, which 
hold great promise for increasing 
solution accuracy at minimal additional 
computational cost.  The unstructured 
dynamic adaptive techniques  
developed in this project is a valuably 
academic reference for researchers and 
engineers who are involved in this field. 
3. For personnel participating in this 
project, the programming capability of 
the unstructured dynamic adaptive 
techniques has been greatly enhanced.  
Furthermore, the understanding of 
physical phenomena concerning blade 
vibration problems in turbomachinery 
has been greatly promoted.   
4. Through the support of this project, one 
international journal paper [Ref. 1] has 
been accepted and one international 
conference paper [Ref. 2] has been 
published. Moreover, several journal as 
well as conference papers are currently 
under submitting.
