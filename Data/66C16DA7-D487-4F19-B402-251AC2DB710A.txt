coatings. To the best of our knowledge, there seems no single research group in Taiwan that 
numerically models the detailed multi-physics numerically inside the magnetron sputtering chamber, 
although it is very important to understand the physics even from a practical point of view. Thus, 
the capability of accurately simulate magnetron sputtering mechanisms is expected to reduce the 
costs of research and development. 
1.1.2 Multi-physics and Multi-scale Problems of Magnetron Sputtering Process 
In addition to its wide applications in various industrial disciplines, the magnetron sputtering 
process is also fundamentally important, because it involves complicated multiple time- and 
length-scales and multiple physics during the materials processing. Understanding these intervening 
physics may help to control or design better processing equipments in the future. A typical 
DC-magnetron sputtering chamber along with its related multi-physics processes is illustrated in 
Fig. 2. This typical arrangement will be used for our modeling in the current proposal. Although it 
may represent one of the simplest types of plasma in the practical world, while it possesses fruitful 
physics yet to be fully understood. Usually the cathode is negatively biased with 400-600V with 
other conductors grounded. This low operating voltage results from the use of magnetic field near 
the cathode as mentioned earlier. Electron number density in the bulk plasma region is 
approximately 109 cm-3. In addition, low gas pressure is preferred (typically 0.1-10 Pa) to preserve 
the ion bombarding energy towards the target by reducing the collision probability with background 
gas molecules. Another advantage of low gas pressure is fewer collisions between sputtered atoms 
and background gas molecules, which can reduce the possibility of scattering the sputtered atoms to 
the chamber wall or back to target surface.

sputtering process), micro-scale (e.g., trench coverage process on the wafer) to chamber scale (e.g., 
transport of sputtered vapor atoms to the wafer); while time scale ranges from fento-seconds (e.g., 
sputtering process), nanoseconds (e.g., electron movement in the plasma) to minutes (or even hours) 
(e.g., thermal diffusion of the vapor atoms on the substrate). Because of the complexity of 
magnetron sputtering related process, increasing reliance is placed upon numerical modeling and 
the use of in-situ sensors to achieve the needed atomic scale control. However, it is still a very 
challenging task to numerically modeling these multi-scale and multi-physics processes in the DC- 
or RF-magnetron plasma sputtering chamber nowadays.  
Sputtering phenomena from the solid is very complicated in essence. Details of the description 
can be found in Smentkowski [3] and the references cited therein. Linear (Fig. 3) and nonlinear (Fig. 
4) cascade phenomena are often used to describe the sputtering process for low and high incident 
ion energies, respectively. The linear Boltzmann transport equation considering binary collision can 
be used to correctly describe the linear cascade phenomenon, while it fails to represent nonlinear 
cascade phenomenon due to complicated collision mechanism. Several experimental studies [3 and 
references cited therein] have shown that sputter yield (atoms per unit time) can be correlated as a 
function of ion bombarding energy and incident angle with respect to the normal of the target, as 
well as the properties of the target materials. A typical example, as shown in Fig. 5, shows the 
sputtering yield as a function of the incident angle of Ar+ bombardment at different energies, where 
θ is defined as the angle between incident direction and the normal of the target. Thus, the 
distribution of ion energy along the target surface and angular distribution of incident ions has direct 
influence on the sputter yield distribution along the target surface, which in turns affects the 
transport of sputtered atoms in the chamber. In addition, the angular and velocity distribution of the 
sputtered vapor atoms above the wafer directly control both the deposition rate and deposition 
uniformity [4]. In summary, the multi-scale and multi-physics modeling is indispensable in better 
understanding the physical processes involved in the magnetron sputtering process. Multi-scale 
modeling may lead to the identification of some novel approaches that utilize adatom energy control 
or control surface diffusion in a systematic way, which can be used for manufacturing some novel 
nano-scale devices [1].

1.1.3 Numerical Modeling of a DC-Magnetron Sputtering Chamber 
Disparity of scales in length and time complicates the numerical modeling of a DC- or 
RF-magnetron sputtering chamber. The influence has several folds. The first is that there is no 
single numerical method covers all scales in length and times. The second is that self-consistent 
iteration, between different length and time scales, is often required, although it does not guarantee 
the converged solution. The third is the solution is obtained in a sequential manner if 
self-consistent solution is practically impossible. Numerical modeling the atoms sputtering and 
transport in a DC- or RF-magnetron sputtering chamber requires simulation tools in several 
disciplines, including DC- or RF-magnetron plasma simulation, target sputtering simulation and 
transport of sputtered vapor atoms. In the following, we will review related literatures and related 
background concerning numerical simulation in each discipline.  
1.1.3.1 DC-magnetron plasma simulation 
Plasmas in materials processing have been modeled numerically using the fluid model [5] or 
the particle method [10]. The fluid model is generally computationally efficient if mobility and 
diffusion coefficients are provided in advance. However, it is valid only when the deviation of 
electron and ion velocity distribution from the Maxwellian (equilibrium) is small and the flow is

PIC method, charge at each charge particle has to be interpolated onto the grid points around them, 
and electric and magnetic fields have to be interpolated back to each charge particle for the purpose 
of computing the Lorentz force. This back-and-forth interpolation has to be done each time step 
during the simulation. However, the interpolation is often ad hoc, either using volume- or 
inverse-distance or even least-square weighted method. Fifth, the computational cost is often very 
high due to the PIC/MCC method. Vector supercomputing is often required to speed up the 
computation, which is not always accessible to most researchers. Parallel computing on 
memory-distributed machines may remedy this at a very cheap price. Thus, a more general 
three-dimensional plasma simulation tool that can deal with complicated geometry and parallel 
processing is strongly required for engineering purpose. 
1.1.3.2 Target Sputtering Simulation 
There are two different kinds of computational methods for target sputtering simulations [20 
and references cited therein]: binary collision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics (MD). 
The BCA method is based on binary collisions and takes into account multiple interactions of the 
projectiles with the target atoms by different approximations. In the approximations, the binding of 
target atoms is not taken into account directly. It is often used successfully to investigate the 
collision process during ion implantation. On the other hand, MD simulation handles the multiple 
interactions of the colliding atom with the target atoms, and the interactions between the target 
atoms simultaneously. Thus, it is more reliable to use MD simulation at all energy levels as 
compared with BCA simulation, although much more time-consuming.  
In the past, there are several MD computations [e.g., 20-22] used to simulate the sputtering 
process from copper (and other metals) surface at different lattice structures. Several issues were 
discussed in these papers, including the effects of different surface lattice structures, depth of origin 
of atoms sputtered, effects of topology of the copper surface, to name a few. In addition, effects of 
different interatomic potentials used in MD simulations were also tested and compared [20,21]. 
These potentials include pairwise ZBL [23] or Molière [21] repulsive potentials for Ar-Cu 
inetraction, pairwise potential (repulsive Molière + cubic spline + attractive Morse) [21] or 
embedded-atom method (EAM) [24] for Cu-Cu interaction. 
Some details of evaluating EAM potential will be given here. In this model, the potential 
energy of the ith atom in the lattice is written as

CHAPTER 2 Research Approaches 
Since we are interested in simulating the multi-scale and multi-physics of a model 
RF-magnetron sputtering chamber (Fig. 2), we will describe the numerical and experimental 
methods, respectively, in the following in turn. 
2.1 Numerical Methods 
In the original proposed 3-year study, the one of the final objectives is to couple the 
multi-scale and multi-physics simulation modules in a RF-magnetron sputtering chamber. Proposed 
flowchart to achieve this goal is shown in Fig. 6. The abbreviations besides each module represents 
the numerical methods used to complete the task. FEM stands for finite element method as usual. 
MD simulation for sputtering process from the copper solid should be integrated directly between 
the plasma simulation module and neutral transport module in a true multi-scale simulation as 
shown in Fig. 6. However, it is not practical or not feasible to do it even with the most modern 
computing power nowadays. Thus, the alternative is to separately conduct the MD simulation for 
sputtering process and to summarize the simulation results into sputtering-yield correlation (model), 
for example, as a function of ion bombarding energy and angle of incidence, among others. This 
correlation then serves as the “glue” at the target surface for adhering the plasma simulation and the 
neutral transport simulation. Each module in this proposed multi-scale and multi-physics simulation 
will be described in the following in turn. Since the original 3-year proposal was cut into a 2-year 
period, the coupling of these multiscale and multiphysics becomes impossible due to the limit of 
time. Thus, only the separate simulations for different types of physics were conducted. 
  14
First, we are interested in developing a three-dimensional simulation code that can deal with 
complicated geometry. Second, we would like to have the flexibility in parallel processing 
employing dynamic domain decomposition on memory-distributed machines, such as PC-Cluster 
system. The argument is especially important since the particle-based plasma simulation is expected 
to be time-consuming and strongly non-balancing in workload distribution if static domain 
decomposition is used instead. In our laboratory, we had a lot of experiences in parallel 
implementation of similar particle simulation code, e.g., DSMC [see our webpage at 
http://wwwdata.me.nctu.edu.tw/must]. Third, since the plasma number-density distribution is 
generally not known in priori, we would like to apply adaptive mesh refinement [see our webpage 
at http://wwwdata.me.nctu.edu.tw/must] in the future if necessary to best resolve the plasma 
distribution, especially in the sheath region near the cathode. Fourth, by solving the field equation 
using finite element method, the interpolation between grid and charge particles comes naturally 
from the numerical method (FE) itself. 
General flowchart of the proposed plasma simulation in RF-magnetron sputtering chamber is 
shown in Fig. 7. We will briefly describe this flowchart as follows. First, the parallel DSMC method 
(PDSC) (see our webpage at http://wwwdata.me.nctu.edu.tw/must) is used to obtain the distributions 
of number density and temperature of the neutrals (argon) in the chamber. Most plasma simulation 
assumes uniform background gas distribution, which may not be correct in the current case. 
Distributions of initial static magnetic field (B) and static electric field (E) due to initially distributed 
charged particles are solved by vector potential Poisson equation and Poisson equation, respectively. 
Using this initial EM field, we then continue our PIC/MC method and field equation repeated 
solving process. Note that considering the physics of much fast electrons (as compared with ions) 
and practical limit, we plan to use the ion time step about 10 times of electron time step. Of course, 
we will conduct some sensitivity study of this issue in the project. In the following, we will describe 
the details of first the PIC/MCC method, then the field equation solver and finally the parallel 
processing on memory-distributed machines. Note in the present report, no PDSC is used to obtain 
the neutral flow field due to limit of time. 
 
2.1.1.1 PIC/MCC method 
The PIC method [6] was originally designed for collisionless charged particle simulations. It 
models the movement of charged particles under the influence of Lorentz force ( )( BvEqF ×+= ,

In order to reproduce plasmas, one has to inevitably resolve the smallest time scale, i.e., 
electron time scale. It is estimated that electrons are the fastest particle in the plasma, with their 
velocities in the range of 105-106 m/s. Thus, this requires an electron time step of 10-10-10-9 s to 
properly model the electron trajectories in the presence of magnetic field. Thus, the time steps of

Since the coefficient matrix is sparse, but symmetric and positive definite, we have applied the 
preconditioned conjugate iterative method [43] and use compressed sparse row (CSR) to store the 
resulting matrix to solve this linear algebra equation.

Details can be found in these references, we will only briefly describe the method here. In this 
parallel technique, Stop at rise (SAR) scheme is used, based on a degradation function, to detect the 
necessity of repartitioning of the computational domain that uses multilevel graph-partitioning 
technique. In addition, the PIC method is only a way of interpolation of between nearby charged 
particles and nodal points; thus, it should pose no problem in parallelizing it. 
2.1.1.3.2 Parallel field equation solver 
For parallel processing field equation (Poisson equation), we need to formulate the system of 
equations in parallel format by storing the coefficient matrix in a distributed manner. As a first step, 
we used the same grid distribution (Fig. 11) used by the PIC/MCC method since we expect the 
computational overhead in PIC/MCC would be much higher than that of solving field equation. We 
will solve equations using parallel version of preconditioned conjugate gradient method [43] using 
compressed-sparse-row (CSR) concept. In this method, we need to update the data at the interface 
nodes between sub-domains by communication using MPI.

method 
2.1.2 Target sputtering simulation  
In the current proposed study, we will use MD simulation as the computational approach for 
studying the sputtering phenomena due to the several reasons mentioned previously. Target material 
is chosen to be copper solid since there are abundant sputtering yield experimental data available in 
the literature [3 and references cited therein]. In addition, there exist several reliable potential 
models such as the EAM [24] and the tight binding model [26] for Cu-Cu interaction. Proposed 
flowchart for the MD simulation is shown in Fig. 12. First, MD simulation is run for the Cu atoms 
  22
)( ijij rUf −∇=  
Equation of motion will be solved using the Gear’s predictor-corrector fifth-order scheme [44]. As 
for the potential models, we will use either pairwise ZBL [23] or Molière [21] repulsive potentials 
for Ar+-Cu interaction, embedded atom model [24] or tight binding model [25,26] for Cu-Cu 
interaction. 
2.1.2.2 Boundary conditions 
In the proposed MD simulation for the sputtering study, a typical arrangement of the atoms 
along with the solid boundary conditions is illustrated in Fig. 13. In the simulation, copper solid 
will be arranged in a fcc lattice structure. In this arrangement, at the bottom, 2-3 layers of atoms 
shall be kept fixed without any vibration energy. On its top, 2-4 layers of atoms will be used for 
wall temperature control. Either simple rescaling method [39,40] or constraint method [45] was 
used for temperature control.

2.1.2.3 Parallel processing 
In order to obtain more reliable data to build up sputtering yield model, large-scale MD 
simulation is inevitable. One of the cheapest ways is to parallelize the code on memory-distributed 
machines, such as PC-Cluster system. There are several methods to parallelize the MD code if 
short-range forces are used, see [46]. It includes atom decomposition, force decomposition and

Another test concerning about the ability to simulate the magnetic field with current sources is 
demonstrated in Fig. 22a. A specified current source with finite volume is simulated and compared 
with analytical solution. Excellent agreement is found as can be seen from Fig. 22b. The above tests 
show that the VPPES is relatively general, which can handle problems with magnetization and 
current source.

gas discharge takes place between two parallel circular electrodes enclosed in a cylindrical chamber. 
Chamber wall with very high dielectric constant is assumed, where we use Neumann boundary 
conditions for Poisson’s equation solver. Considering geometrical symmetry, we only use 1/16 of 
the full chamber for simulation. Simulation conditions are similar to those presented in quasi-1D RF 
gas discharge in previous section except ~0.16 million tetrahedral cells are used. Speedup test is 
conducted on HP-IA (64-bit) clusters parallel machines (distributed-memory) up to 32 processors.  
Figure 25 illustrates the resulting speedup as a function of the number of processors. Results 
show that speedup increases with increasing number of simulation particles per cell. Also the use of 
dynamic domain decomposition (DDD) each 1500∆te improves the parallel performance 
appreciably as compared with the case using only static domain decomposition, especially when 
there are more particles in the simulation. Note that DDD activated each 1500∆te results in the best 
parallel performance in the current simulation condition. Using 32 processors, parallel efficiency as 
high as 83% can be obtained if 40 particles/cell is used, while only 58% can be obtained if 40 
particles/cell is used. Typical evolution of the domain decomposition is illustrated in Fig. 26, which 
clearly shows that the DDD can adaptively adjust the partitioning domain.

3.4 Parallel Molecular Dynamics Simulation Code 
Fig. 29 shows the parallel molecular dynamics simulation using one million argon atoms 
under different temperatures and pressures. Corresponding parallel performance using dynamic 
domain decomposition is illustrated in Fig. 29. Parallel efficiency is in the range of 40-60% for all 
cases considered, which is otherwise even lower if static domain decomposition is used instead.

Fig. 35 Number of sputtered copper atoms as a function of energy at incident ion energy of 5,000 eV. (left) 
theta=0 degree; (right) theta=20 degrees. 
Fig. 36 show that the highest sputtered yield occurs at 20 degrees of incidence as presented 
earlier. In addition, elongation of sputtered-yield distribution in the direction of incidence is clearly 
seen in Fig. 36b, especially for the case of 20 degrees of incidence.

Due to the budget constraint and limit of time, we have only measured the DC gas discharge 
without and with magnetron using a newly installed Langmuir probe. The overview of the system 
can be found in Fig. 37, where the Langmuir probe is installed in the left-hand side. Fig. 38 shows 
the picture of sputtered aluminum target, while Fig. 39 shows the picture of permanent magnet 
assembly system behind the target.
