Inside the channel of the PDMS PHP, different heating powers were employed to 
observe the working situation, flow direction of the vapor plug, liquid slug and the 
structure form of the flow. A high speed video camera was used to record the 
formation, combination, collapse, flow direction and the different kinds of flow of the 
bubble. At the same time, we can find out the vapor plug and liquid slug are unstable 
and uneven in growth and distribution which caused the PDMS PHP to oscillate and 
work.

final product has been tested and the results were analyzed. 
A Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) appears to turn many meandering which includes 
evaporator and condenser sections. The straight part in the middle is the adiabatic 
section. Vapor bubbles are produced in the evaporator section and the liquid slugs are 
produced in the condenser section. The PHP is according to the changes of the 
pulsating motion principle of the vapor-liquid two phase system, which can transfer 
heat from one end to the others, to meet the high demand for the distribution of heat 
from miniaturized electronic products.  
The working fluids are heated in the volume expansion, which cools to shrink 
and partly condense. Motion of the cooling process in the working fluids will transfer 
vapor bubbles to the condenser section and transfer condensed liquids back to the 
evaporator section. When heat is imported it causes high pressure in the vapor area for 
the evaporator section. Because of the high pressure of the vapor bubbles they also 
form and offer an energy source to drive the liquid slug to flow. As long as the heating 
and cooling system exists, the motion of the liquid and vapor occurs spontaneously.  
 
1-2 Literature Review 
The technology of PHP which is circulates the working fluid within the 
meandering capillary tube. It is called meandering capillary tube heat pipe, or 
self-excited oscillation (pulsation) heat pipe or Akachi pipe named after Hisateru 
Akachi (see Fig.1-01 and Fig.1-02) [1]. 
When one end of the capillary tube is heated (the evaporator), the working fluids 
evaporate and increase the pressure of vapor, thus causing the bubbles in the 
evaporator zone to grow. This pushes the liquid towards the low-temperature end (the 
condenser). Cooling of the condenser results in a reduction of vapor pressure and 
condensation of bubbles in that section of the heat pipe. The growth and collapse of 
bubbles in the evaporator and condenser sections, respectively, results in an oscillating 
motion within the tube. Heat is transferred through latent heat in the vapor and 
through sensible heat transported by the liquid slugs [2]. 
In 2004, C.Y. Tsai et al. found that some of the gold particle solution could be 
used in the application of heat pipes. At a same charge volume, there is a significant 
reduction in thermal resistance of heat pipe with nano-fluid as compared with DI 
water. The measured results also show that the thermal resistance of a vertical meshed 
heat pipe varies with the size of gold nano-particles [3]. 
In 2006, S. W. Kang et al. discuss the thermal enhancement of heat pipe 
performance using silver nano-fluid as the working fluid. The higher thermal 
performance of nano-fluids indicates nano-fluid potential as a substitute for 
conventional pure water in grooved heat pipes. This finding survey makes nano-fluid

inside the heat pipe is very complex, due to phase changes and interactions between 
the slugs and plugs. Close to a horizontal orientation (between 5° and 15° to 
horizontal) all oscillations ceased completely, the heater area dried out and thermal 
resistance increased drastically to a value of the order of the reference empty structure 
resistance [12]. 
A wide range of PHP has been experimentally studied, thus providing vital 
information on the parameter dependency of their thermal performance. The results 
indicate a strong influence of gravity and a number of turns in the performance. The 
thermo physical properties of working fluids affect the performance which also 
strongly depends on the boundary conditions of the PHP operation [13]. 
J. L. Xu et al. provided very good descriptions of previous work focusing on the 
thermal performance evaluation and simple flow visualization. The present paper 
reports detailed high-speed flow visualization experiments [14]. 
Y. H. Lin et al. reported preliminary experimental results on using copper tube 
having an internal and an external diameter of 2.4mm and 3mm respectively. Finally, 
for a filling ratio of 60% and a heating power of 85W, the temperature difference was 
less than 7.79ºC and the thermal resistance was also less than 0.092ºC/W [15-16].  
Y. Honghai et al. presented an experimental study on the operational limitations 
of closed loop PHPs, the effects of the inner diameter, operational orientation; filling 
ratio and heat input flux on thermal performance were investigated. The results show 
that, for the CLPHP with 2 mm ID tubes, the best performance was in the vertical 
orientation with heating from the bottom [17]. 
The measured thermal resistances were strongly influenced by the tilt angle, fill 
rate and cross sectional geometry. The best performance of the PHPs with rectangular 
cross section was observed with fill rates of less than 10% in a vertical orientation 
[18]. 
It is rare to find a combination of such events and mechanisms like bubble 
nucleation and collapse, bubble agglomeration and pumping action, flow regime 
changes, pressure/temperature perturbations, dynamic instabilities, metastable 
non-equilibrium conditions, flooding or bridging etc., all contributing together 
towards the thermal performance of a device [19].  
When a sufficiently large volume of gas is injected into a vertical pipe filled with 
stagnant or flowing liquid, large air bubbles are formed. Those bubbles, usually called 
Taylor Bubbles, have a bullet shape and occupy most of the pipe cross section. The 
bubble is surrounded by a thin liquid film that flows downward [20]. 
Through steady state experiments, the effect of heat flux, mass flux and inlet sub 
cooling on pressure drop and heat transfer in narrow channels is obtained. Flow 
patterns and the transition of flow patterns along the channel axis are observed

Chapter 2 
Effect of Silver Nano-fluid on PHP Thermal Performance 
 
2-1 Introduction 
The first section of this study gives the initial experimental results of using 
copper tubing with an internal diameter of 2.4 mm and an external diameter of 3mm 
in pulsating heat pipe experiments. The working fluids used were silver nano-fluid 
water solution and pure water. 
  We compared 20nm of silver nano-fluid at different concentrations (100ppm and 
450ppm) and different filling ratios (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, respectively) with 
different heating powers (5W, 15W, 25W, 35W, 45W, 55W, 65W, 75W, 85W 
respectively). Experimental results indicated that the middle filling ratios (40% and 
60%) gave the best results. The heat dissipation effect is compared to the heat 
exchange and at 60% filling ratio, the more liquid slugs are produced able to carry 
more sensible heat. Heat dissipation is better at 60% filling ratio than at 40%, and the 
best working fluid is 100ppm silver nano-fluid. 
 Observations with silver nano-fluid were compared with similar observations 
taken using pure water. With the heating power at 85W, the average temperature 
difference and thermal resistance of the evaporator and condenser decreased by 
7.79°C and 0.092°C/W respectively. 
 
2-2 Experimental Set-up 
2-2-1 PHP Set-up 
The experiments were conducted with closed loop type pulsating heat pipe, 
serpentine and joined with the same pipe with internal diameter 2.45mm and external 
diameter 3mm. We can consult the experimental apparatus (Fig. 2-01), the under part 
is the evaporator and the upper part is the condenser. Heating were supplied for five 
turns and the interval is about 2mm, working fluid are pure water and silver 
nano-fluid. About the tube design, the most important condition of PHP is the 
production of the liquid slug. According to the literature review, Akachi (1996) [26] 
proposes that the appearance and movement of bubbles are affected by surface tension 
and buoyancy in the channel. Relation of surface tension and buoyancy could be 
explained by the following dimensionless formula: 
( )

The other one dimensionless formula is the Froude Number, 
 
 
 8
(5) Turn on the temperature scanner and power supply, adjust the heating power to 
5W, and then begin to observe and note down the temperature at each point 
through the computer. 
(6) After the temperature curve is balanced, adjust the heating power to 15W (plus 
10W). Again, after the temperature curve is balanced and the heating power is 
adjusted to 25W. Repeat this step until 85W or PHP dries out. 
(7) Filled in with the working fluid of different filled ratio or concentration again. 
Steps 4-6 are repeated. 
 
2-3 Results and Discussion 
The PHP depends on the bubble pulsation and pushes the liquid slug to the 
condensation which results heat dissipation, too high filled ratio will make the bubble 
not easy to drive, showing poor pulsation and efficiency results. Too low filled ratio is 
rather easier to make the bubble pulsation and get easier to make it dry out. 
 
2-3-1 Pure Water as in Working Fluid 
According to Fig. 2-04 to Fig. 2-11 show when the heat input is higher than 35W, 
40%~80% of filled ratio in temperature difference shows almost of the same behavior, 
and 20% shows an increase by a large margin. 20% of filled ratio in thermal 
resistance values shows increases and appear in a half dry out state from 35W to 65W. 
The test indicated that 75W afterwards the state of the thermal resistance curve shows 
totally dry out. Due to the thermal resistance value, it could be observed before 35W, 
causing a low heat input and the amount of the steam gradually becomes less, so 
dissipating the heat result mainly depends on the bubble pulsation and it is easier for 
bubble pulsation in a small quantity of filled amount of PHP, so   thermal resistance 
value gets low. In addition, we can also observe that there is an increased filled 
amount at 80%, it is slow to start and apparently it starts to work from 25W. As a 
result, the 60% of filled ratio is the best. 
 
2-3-2 Influence of Silver Nano-fluid Concentration. 
(1) Concentration is 100ppm. 
It is more obvious to start at 25W for every group of the experiment. Under the 
low heat input (i.e. under 45W), the dissipating heat result still mainly depends on the 
bubble pulsation. Hence the amount of the filled ratio distribution shows the 
difference in temperature and thermal resistance (Fig. 2-04 to Fig. 2-11). At the stage 
of increased heat input for every group evaporator, it shows a violent and boiling 
situation, causing vapor bubble pushes liquid slug that includes sensible heat amount 
which can also influence the efficiency. On the whole, too many or too few filled 
 
 
 10
(4) Filled ratio is 80％. 
This will have a direct consequence of the average temperature difference and 
thermal resistance for up to 85W, the best efficiency is 100ppm in silver nano-fluid 
water solution. Secondly it is pure water and 450ppm in silver nano-fluid water 
solution. It is clear that before 65W, the efficiency of pure water is better than 
nano-fluid, when the filled ratio is 80% as shown in Fig. 2-10 and Fig. 2-11.  
It is difficult to get formulation and pulsation of the bubble, so the viscosity of 
the nano-fluid (450ppm) will be more difficult to obtain. When the heat input is 
getting higher, the advantage of nano-fluid could be seen clearly [27].

(8) PDMS work normally in temperatures from -45ºC to 200ºC and the life-span is as 
long as two years. 
(9) PDMS becomes elastic after solidification, the modulus of elasticity is 1.4Mpa and 
the coefficient of thermal expansion is 3.14×10-4/ºC. 
 
3-3 Experimental Set-up 
3-3-1 PDMS PHP Designing 
(1) Channel Diameter Design 
Akachi, the originator of the oscillating/pulsating heat pipe, presented a paper 
[31], on these heat pipe types, which operate on the basis of movement of bubbles, 
governed by surface tension and buoyancy in the heat pipe channel.  
We can refer to the ratio 2-2-1 when calculating the channel diameter of PDMS 
PHP. The size of channel cannot be too large or too small, as it will influence the 
working of the PHP. The best range for the channel diameter is given in the survey of 
A. A. M. Delil [32] and its references [33-35], and in [36]:

acceleration of gravity) 
Table 3-02 gives for the different working fluids in the internal channel diameters 
for a saturation temperature of 20°C. 
(2) Evaporator Design 
Evaporator section heats the working fluid inside the channel to bring out 
working of the experiment. The heating temperature of the working fluid should range 
in between the coexisting of liquid and vapor phases. Utilize the higher heat transfer 
efficiency of copper block (56mm×10mm) to take as the heating area. In the mean 
time, the 6mm diameter and 31mm length heating bar with 60W heating power 
imbedding in the copper block as the heat source. It will cover with heat insulation 
material all around the copper block which can prevent heat from being lost and 
influencing the experimental result. Eventually, the heating bar was connected with 
the power supply to conduct the heat work. 
(3) Design of the adiabatic section 
Due to its lower thermal conductivity and the heat conduction coefficient is 
0.2W/mk, PDMS is a good heat insulating material. Therefore heat is not easily lost 
from the tube wall. So in the adiabatic section the extra heat insulation is unnecessary. 
However, the fabrication process must control the bonding result of PDMS basic and 
 
 
 14
Before bonding we must clean the PDMS which influences the complete bonding 
successfully, in order to get rid of impurities, such as dust particle, oil and organic 
matter that still remain on the surface of PDMS, except for using the oscillating 
machine of ultrasonic waves and organic solvents cleaning method, the procedure is 
as follows: 
(1) Apply de-ionized water (DI Water), and put into the oscillating machine of 
ultrasonic wave and oscillate for 10 minutes. 
(2) Put acetone into the oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave and oscillate for 10 
minutes. 
(3) Use isopropyl alcohol (IPA), in the oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave and 
oscillate for 10 minutes. 
(4) Put DI water in the oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave to oscillate for 10 
minutes. Ultimately blow it dry with nitrogen (N2). 
The last step of the PDMS PHP manufacturing process is bonding (Fig. 3-05 
bonding with Fig. 3-06). The PDMS Sticking Method uses the unhardened PDMS as 
the bonding pharmaceutical to bond the PDMS basic at 5mm thickness (Fig. 3-05) 
and PDMS mould placing it in T-type thermocouples fixed in a suitable position (Fig. 
3-06). It was then put into the oven and heated in order to make the combination as 
shown in Fig. 3-07. 
 
3-3-4 Extracting and Filling 
After finishing the PHP device, one keeps the vacuum and fills the working fluid 
inside the PHP. The two processes could be regarded as the finalization of PHP. 
Air extraction included extracting the air from the inner part of the PHP and 
eliminating the non-condensable gases of the working fluids. One uses a vacuum 
pump to lower the pressure on the inside of the PHP. The purpose of the vacuum 
inside the pipe enables the working fluid to reach its saturated state at lower 
temperatures, to reduce its boiling point and to eliminate the non-condensable gases of 
the working fluids from the PHP. Fig. 3-08 shows a schematic of the extracting and 
filling. 
 
3-3-5 Experimental Apparatus and Parameters 
The structure of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 3-09. This 
experiment will be tested by the way of water cooling, with the  regular filling with 
methanol and ethanol, in vertical and horizontal orientations at different heating 
powers to measure the thermal performance. The design of the experiment and its 
parameters are shown in Table 3-03. 
 
 
 
 16
3-4-2 Ethanol-Vertical Orientation 
When the heating power is 3W and before PHP has not yet started (Fig. 3-11), 
the temperature rises rapidly in the evaporator, that is, the thermal convection of a 
single phase, but the heat transfer is not satisfactory. As the heating power increases 
and PHP has begun to start working, we can find out the temperature curve line of the 
evaporator which has no working starting point and the temperature does not rise from 
4W to 8W in the evaporator. We can call this area the oscillating period of the PHP 
and the result shows the best conduction of heat. 
Compare the evaporator temperature and thermal resistance of methanol and 
ethanol are shown in Fig. 3-12 and Fig. 3-13. 
 
3-4-3 Methanol and Ethanol-Horizontal Orientation 
When the working fluid is methanol, in horizontal orientation, pressure shows a 
uniform state inside the channel. Although it causes a pressure difference between the 
evaporator and the condenser, but this pressure difference does not make vapor plugs 
and liquid slugs work efficiently, so the conduction of heat effect is not efficient. 
When the heating power is 4W, the temperature reaches to 100°C in the evaporator. 
When the heating power is 5W, the evaporator shows the drying-out phenomenon as 
shown in Fig. 3-12. 
When the working fluid is ethanol, the conducting heat effect is the same as for 
methanol, which doesn't show good results in a horizontal orientation. When the 
heating power is 4W in the evaporator, it will exceed 100°C. When the heating power 
is 5W, the evaporator also shows a drying out phenomenon. Both methanol and 
ethanol show the drying-out phenomenon with the horizontal orientation as shown in 
Fig. 3-13 and Fig. 3-14. 
The conduction of heat effect does not show good results and the thermal 
resistance can not descend in methanol and ethanol (Table 3-04), due to the higher 
thermal resistance via the experimental, these two working fluids unsuitable for 
horizontal orientation. 
 
3-4-4 Influences on PDMS PHP of the Gravity 
The experiment set in vertical orientation of the PHP, the working fluid inside the 
channel, due to the influence of the gravity, forms a pressure drop, the following 
pressure is higher than the pressure above, and hence it is easy to produce greater 
pressure differences which contribute to the working of the vapor plug and liquid slug. 
After condensation the working fluid can be influenced by gravity and reaches the 
evaporator very quickly. 
When the PHP is set in a horizontal orientation, the working fluid is free of

Chapter 4  
Visualization of PDMS PHP 
 
4-1 Introduction 
The following experiment is the last chapter, according to   results of 
transparent PDMS in observing the working flow, vapor bubble and working fluids 
pulsating inside the channel of the PDMS PHP. 
This section discusses the preliminary experimental results obtained using 
polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) to manufacture a visual pulsating heat pipe 56 mm long, 
49mm wide and with an internal diameter of 2mm, including the manufacturing 
process, vacuum management, filling and packaging. The working fluids were 
methanol and ethanol. The pipe was filled to a ratio of 60%. Thermal performance 
was tested using heating power values ranging from 3W to 8W. A high-speed video 
camera was used to record the working performance of the working fluid inside the 
channel. The results were discussed and analyzed. 
A high-speed camera was used to observe and record the activity inside the 
channel of the PDMS PHP. Varying heating powers were used in experimental 
working of the PHP. Observations were made of the working situation, including the 
flow direction of the vapor plug, liquid slug as well as the structure and formation of 
the flow. Observations were made of the formation, combination, collapse, flow 
direction and kinds of flow of the bubble. Notice was taken that the vapor plug and 
the liquid slug are unstable and uneven in growth, formation and distribution which 
caused the PDMS PHP to oscillate and work  
 
4-2 Results and Discussion 
4-2-1 Methanol/Vertical Orientation/4W 
When the heating power is 3W in vertical operation, due to the convection heat 
transfer at this stage, there forms mostly small bubbles and a few big bubbles. The 
production velocity of bigger bubbles is slower than with the smaller bubbles. 
Consequently, the oscillating force is relatively smaller. On the other hand, the 
bubbles make an up-and-down motion of low oscillation amplitude inside the centre 
of the channel majority. 
When the heating power is 4W, as shown in Fig. 4-01, we can observe the 
relative motion of the vapor plug and liquid slug is greater than 3W. We can also see 
that big bubbles, similar to the slug bubble are produced inside the channel.  This is 
capillary slug flow as the bubbles make up-and-down and motion of higher oscillation 
amplitude central inside the channel.

condenser originally will move down to the evaporator pushed by the vapor plug and 
liquid slug from above. When vapor plugs A and B are pushed and shoved to the 
condenser sustaining means the latent heat and sensible heat that are already absorbed 
will be released. The liquid slug C is pushed and shoved to the evaporator with 
absorbs the heat sustaining. Finally the working fluid forms a cycle of heat 
absorb-release as illustrated in Fig. 4-05 (c) and (d). 
 
4-2-5 The Flow Pattern inside the Channel of the PDMS PHP 
(1) The vapor plug and liquid slug distribution in the vertical orientation. 
The effect of surface tension is greater than gravity and causes the working fluid 
inside the channel with isothermal in the vertical orientation of the PHP showing an 
uneven distribution of different sizes of the vapor plug and liquid slugs (see Fig. 
4-06). 
(2) The vapor plug and liquid slug type of the evaporator and condenser. 
The nuclear boiling formation in evaporator of the PHP that absorbed heat 
continuously from input heating power. When the working fluid reaches the saturation 
temperature, it will make a phase change and produce bigger vapor plugs. The 
expansion and shrinkage of the vapor plug produced a similar pump action to push 
liquid slug in the vicinity setting them in motion. The flow pattern of the evaporator is 
shown in Fig. 4-07(a). Due to the working fluid absorbing heat continuously, boiling 
and nuclear boiling phenomena were observed. When the bubbles get combine 
together constantly, it will form the bigger vapor plugs and the flow direction is 
toward the condenser. 
Due to the liquid gathering in the condenser, bigger bubbles released their latent 
heat and gradually broke into smaller bubbles as shown in Fig. 4-07 (b). The flow 
pattern of the condenser is mostly changing from slug bubble flow into minute bubble 
flow. 
 
(3) The combination of vapor plug. 
The short vapor plug combined with long vapor plug inside the channel of PHP 
as illustrated in Fig. 4-08 (a). The longer vapors plug (A) moves upwards while when 
the shorter vapor plugs, B and C move with greater speed. The vapor plugs collide 
and combine to form a single larger vapor plug as shown in Fig. 4-08 (b) and (c). We 
also observed big vapor plugs separate into many small vapor plugs. This vapor plug 
type is the most commonly seen in the visualization flow which has similar 
characteristics of the slug shape.  
(4) The flow pattern of the minute bubble. 
The flow pattern of the minute bubble is as shown in Fig. 4-09. The

5-1 Conclusions 
The PHP makes use of bubbles to pulse and promote the liquid slug development 
and dispel the heat to the condensation section. In PHP, considerably a high filled 
ratio will hinder the pulsation of the bubble and the efficiency of the heat transfer will 
not be favorable enough. The low filled ratio will get pulsation of the bubble easily, 
but it dries out extremely easily. So the most effective filled ratio is between 40% and 
60%. The results will be enable to explain, maybe in these two filled ratio and at a 
high heating power, bubble production and the effect of pulsation get balanced. The 
dissipated latent heat of the bubbles are close to, but 60% of the liquid amount is more, 
therefore the liquid slug amounts will turn and carry more sensible heat. So in these 
four kinds of filled ratio, the best one is 60%. 
Compare through the experiment, the greater efficiency of heat transfer is 
100ppm concentration of silver nano-fluid water solution; the worse one is 450ppm 
with the concentration of silver nano-fluid water solution. Although the nano-fluid has 
the higher heat-conduction coefficient that dispels more heat theoretically. But the 
higher concentration will make the higher viscosity. The higher viscosity makes the 
bubble difficult to produce and the force of friction causes obstruction of the liquid 
slug with tube wall becomes larger, so obstruction is relatively greater when the 
bubble is promoted and influences the whole efficiency of the heat transfer. 
The experimental shows the best filled ratio is 60%, and the better filled fluid is 
100ppm of silver nano-fluid. When the filled ratio is 60% and the heating power is 
85W, the average temperature difference of evaporator and condenser compared with 
the pure water is less than 7.79ºC, and the thermal resistance is also less than 
0.092ºC /W. 
The mini PDMS pulsating heat pipes were employed due to the low materials 
cost in the manufacturing process and application of the potential advantage (utilizing 
the mould group type and taking the device of this research by inserting into the 
electronic products of 3C). 
When the experiment is set in a vertical orientation, and the heating power is 
raised from 3W to 8W, the evaporator temperature for methanol is lower than for 
ethanol. When the heating power is increased, the thermal resistance of these two 
working fluids decreases gradually. The thermal resistance for methanol is lower than 
for ethanol. When the heating power is 3W, the thermal resistance for methanol is 
reduced to 4.5°C/W, as compared to ethanol. When the heating power is 4W, the 
temperature of evaporator is lowered to 15°C.

Abstract - English 
This device combines the Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) and a Heat Spreader with 
heat dissipation technology of two kinds of heat transfer devices. PHP is, according to 
the change of pulsating motion principle of the vapor-liquid two phase system, able to 
transfer heat from one end to another end to meet the high demand for heat 
distribution in miniaturized electronic products. On the other hand, the heat spreader 
has the ability to spread heat evenly from the surface to heat sink and to eliminate hot 
spots on the device. This patent combines these two cooling devices and is called Flat 
Pulsating Heat Spreader. 
 
B-1 Introduction 
B-1-1 Illustration of the Patent Technology 
1. New Developments 
After checking relevant patents, scientific and technological literature and journals, 
I found that there was nothing that was even similar, thus it is a new development.  
2. Progress (problems which can be solved with this invention) 
   Consumer electronic products are becoming smaller due to   developments in 
micro-electronics, such as cell phone, notebook computers, etc. Because the volume is 
reduced, function and performance has improved but they generate more heat. Many 
heat transfer devices have been designed but most have been unsuccessful. In order to 
solve the problem of removing large amounts of waste heat from electronic equipment, 
 
 
 64
Akachi (1996) [1] utilized the pulse-flow mechanism of heat-driven inside the 
heat pipe early most and the heating power is 5W/cm2. The heat flow ability of the 
PHP was very low at that time. Zuo [2] took porous material combined with 
pulse-flow to manufacture a high performance of PHP. This patent is regarded as the 
PHP applied to a heat spreader that can attain the best heat spread and heat dissipation 
results. 
The micro channel used in this new type structure of heat sink and heat pipe [3] 
were deemed to have the effect of laminar flow inside the micro channel heat sink and 
is better than the turbulent flow inside a larger-sized pipeline. A lot of bottlenecks 
appeared when this technology was applied to the heat spreader. The research group 
of micro-electro-mechanical in the Tamkang University engaged in the study of 
micro-heat-pipe heat-spreaders, and published many papers in international journals 
and conferences [4−7]. In addition, the Electronics Research & Service Organization 
developed the Cu-Wu micro-heat-pipe heat-spreader [8]. The bottleneck was a space 
problem, so this patent employs the technologies of micro-channel heat sink in 
manufacturing the PHP and utilizing the mechanism of pulse flow to build the effect 
of heat spread. 
 
B-2-2 Purpose of Invention 
The systematic technology of micro-electro-mechanical has grown vigorously in 
recent years. The semiconductor process also benefits from micro-electro-mechanical 
technology to make the leading wire of the central processing unit (CPU) of the 
personal computer shrink day by day. The operational capability according to the 
Moore’s Law will grow up one time every eighteen months. The heat dissipation 
problem means that the operational speed of the central processing unit and drawing 
chip are unable to improve at present. The biggest bottleneck is the inability to solve 
effectively on the problem of heat dissipation. There are two treatment methods for 
heat dissipation with high efficiency of the central processing unit. First, it will break 
away the heat from the chip of the central processing unit. Second, take the heat 
diffusion to greater area of the heat dissipation. This patent is directed against the 
second method to propose the pulsating heat spreader. It will take the heat source 
diffusion to greater area quickly and develop the greater benefit from the sink-fan 
module, heat-pipe module and other ways of radiator at present. The pulsating heat 
spreader is as shown in Fig. A-2. 
This technology was developed so that it could be manufactured in bulk at low 
cost and with wide application in a variety of products where heat dissipation is 
necessary.  
The manufacture of the micro-structure heat spreader used 
 
 
 66
evaporator. If it is heated continuously, the boiling will turn into the forced convection 
boiling. The continuous structure of liquid slugs and the vapor bubbles are formed by 
the meandering channel of the pulsating heat pipe. When the process starts a large 
amount of working fluid pulsates in the condenser. When operating at a steady state 
only some pulsation happens inside the heat pipe. During the circulation of the 
working fluids of the evaporator will come from the condenser. The heat transfer 
process is successive and improves the performance of the heat dissipation. 
Although there is no capillarity structure in the pulsating heat pipe, the restoring 
force of evaporator’s working fluids comes from the driving force near the turn in the 
channel. This restoring force is responsible for the working fluids between evaporator 
and condenser, so the working fluids to go back to the evaporator and repeat another 
heat transfer in the circulatory system. Hence, it is essential to the working of 
pulsating heat pipe for the reciprocation between driving force and restoring force. 
Accordingly to the coordination of these two forces make the heat transfer mechanism 
successive from the evaporator to the condenser. 
This patent is expounded for a new type of pulsating heat spreader that utilizes 
the processing methods of carve, etch and turning over the mold. The finished 
pulsating heat pipe structure is made of various types of materials, such as copper, 
aluminum, silicon and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) etc. 
 
B-3 Conclusions 
One of the methods to improve the heat dissipation of the central processing unit 
is to set about the thermal conduction characteristics inside the packaging. The heat 
spreader will prevent heat from concentrating and forming a high temperature area. 
The effect of pulsation will increase the velocity of thermal movement and the 
performance of heat dissipation which can eliminates the concerns of thermal stress in 
electronic products. 
The pulsating heat pipe is different to the traditional heat pipe and there is no 
need to increase the capillarity structure inside the channel. It is easy to work 
according to forces with the capillary. The structure is simple and the manufacturing 
process is easy. The pulsating heat spreader can also be developed according to 
various designs including the radiation type, the  straight line type and the double 
straight line type as are shown in Fig. A-3, Fig. A-4 and Fig. A-5.

ABSTRACT 
 
This paper reports on preliminary experimental results on using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to 
manufacture mini type pulsating heat pipe. Aluminum mold was utilizing mold turning process to finish the 
pulsating heat pipe by using PDMS material that includes the vacuum management for filling and packaging. 
Try to design a standard process to manufacture the prototype and to complete the test platform structure. 
Eventually, the semicircle groove diameter and the depth of the channel are 2mm and the final experimental 
device size is 56mm×50mm×10mm in this research. When the working fluid is methanol, according to the 
heating power versus thermal resistance, increasing the heating power, then the PHP is making and moving. 
When the heating power reaches 8 watts and the PHP will making and moving obviously. So we can get the 
lowest thermal resistance. But as the heating power increases continuously, because the condenser is unable 
to offer a satisfactory condensation result, working fluid of the evaporator will become less gradually at this 
moment, namely to cause dry-out and thermal resistance of the condenser and the evaporator will become 
higher. 
 
KEY WORDS: PDMS, Pulsating Heat Pipes, Turn Over the Mold, Filled Ratio 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Modern integrated circuit follows the continuous 
improvement of semiconductor minute 
manufacturing techniques, the quantities and 
densities of 3C electronic components on a single 
chip increases rapidly. To deal with miniaturization 
tendency of light, thin, short and small in the 
electronic components. The heat dissipated of 
miniaturized make chips to be operated in higher 
temperature which decreases not only the speed of 
electronic components but also the stability of the 
chips. Hence needs to seek a kind of faster and 
more effective heat dissipation technology. Utilize 
the processing methods of carve, etch and turn over 
the mold, finished the pulsating heat pipe structure 
on various types of materials, such as copper, 
aluminum, silicon and polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) etc. 
 
Appearances of the Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) turn 
to many meanderings which includes evaporator 
and condenser section. Straight part in the middle is 
the adiabatic section. Vapor bubbles are production 
in the evaporator section and liquid slugs are 
production in the condenser section. PHP is 
according to the change of pulsating motion 
principle of the vapor-liquid two phase system, can 
transfer heat from one end to another end, to meet 
the high demand for distributing heat of 
miniaturization electronic product. The working 
fluids are heated in the volume expansion, which 
cools to shrink and condense partly. Motion of 
cooling process in the working fluids will transfer 
vapor bubbles to the condenser section and transfer 
condensation liquids back to the evaporator section. 
When import in heat will cause high pressure in 
vapor area for the evaporator section. Because high 
pressure of the vapor bubbles also form and offer 
energy source to drive liquid slug to flow. As long 
as heating and cooling system exists, motion of the 
liquid and vapor are spontaneous.  
 
To complete the structure of pulsating heat pipe by 
using the PDMS material that includes the vacuum 
management for filling and packaging. Try to 
 283
This research observes fluids making and moving 
inside the channel for being convenient, and then it 
is comparatively suitable for a channel structure of 
PHP to choose the transparent material. After 
finishing aluminum mould making of PHP, we can 
use PDMS to turn over the mould and make PHP. 
The whole fabrication process utilizes liquid silica 
gel and solidification pharmaceutical by the 
proportion of 10:1 is mixed evenly, and it produces 
a lot of bubbles in the course of stirring, so put the 
above mixed PDMS in the vacuum oven first for 
air-extraction to 30 minutes, utilize low-pressure to 
remove the bubbles produced while mixing, after 
finishing air-extraction, pour the PDMS into the 
aluminum mould. Before pouring the PDMS into 
the inside of aluminum mould, in order to prevent 
PDMS from leaking, we use the gummed tape to 
seal the aluminum mould with four sides. At the 
same time, we will put the good heat conduction of 
copper blocks into the aluminum mould, and these 
copper blocks are the evaporator and condenser, 
then put the semi-finished product device into the 
vacuum oven for air-extraction to 30 minutes, after 
finishing the air-extraction and continue heating in 
the vacuum oven, heat 60  for an hour to make ℃
PDMS totally solidified. After complete 
solidification of PDMS, strip with the aluminum 
mould, namely the PDMS material of PHP finished 
is in contrary to aluminum mould shape as shown in 
Fig. 3.

About the device manufacturing process, the last 
one step is bonding. This experiment is to use 
oxygen plasma method to make the bonding, and 
utilize the reaction ion etching (RIE) to change the 
surface character of PDMS. Utilizing the low radio 
frequency power of oxygen plasma in short 
processing time, the result of the surface activates 
are better than the high radio frequency power of 
oxygen plasma in long processing time, and 
bonding the PDMS with glass finally. Four 
important parameters which use oxygen plasma 
method are as follows: 
(1) Power (70W) 
(2) Pressure (75mtorr) 
(3) Flow quantity (20sccm) 
(4) Time (10sec) 
 
Before bonding we must clean the PDMS and glass 
which influences the complete bonding successfully, 
in order to get rid of the pollutant, such as dust 
particle, oil and organic matter that make the 
surface remain of PDMS and glass, except using the 
oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave and organic 
solvent cleaning method, the procedure as follows: 
(1) Use the de-ionized water (DI Water), and put 
into the oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave 
to oscillate for 10 minutes. 
(2) Use the acetone, and put into the oscillating 
machine of ultrasonic wave to oscillate for 10 
minutes. 
(3) Use the isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and put into the 
oscillating machine of ultrasonic wave to 
oscillate for 10 minutes. 
(4) Put into the DI water, and the oscillating 
machine of ultrasonic wave to oscillate for 10 
minutes. Finally blow it to dry with the nitrogen 
(N2). 
 
After finishing management and cleaning, we can 
bond PDMS with glass immediately; do not need to 
exert any external force and binder. Take the PDMS 
and glass aim at the bonding and put for 80 , 60 ℃
minutes on hot plate. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show 
finished bonding of the PDMS with glass picture.

Fig. 8. 50% in filled ratio of methanol / average 
thermal resistance of evaporator and condenser 
 
The methanol acts as the working fluid, and when 
the heating power is plotted against the thermal 
resistance, the heating power gets to increase; the 
PHP is making and moving accordingly. When the 
heating power attains to 8 watts and apparently the 
PHP will be making and moving. Thus, we can get 
the lowest thermal resistance from the figure. But as 
the heating power increases without stopping, 
because the condenser is not able to give a good 
and satisfactory condensation outcome, working 
fluid of the evaporator will become momentary less 
at this moment, namely resulting dry-out and 
thermal resistance of the condenser and the 
evaporator will reach higher. 
 
 
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mini pulsating heat 
pipes were fabricated employing the molding and 
oxygen plasma bonding technology. Now we can 
find the low materials cost manufacturing process 
and application of the potential advantage (utilizing 
the mould group type and taking the device of this 
research by inserting into the electronic products of 
3C). 
 
From this experimental survey, we will continue to 
conduct the following research： 
(1) Improve the cooling method of the condenser 
(constant temperature of water trough or the 
wind-tunnel). 
(2) Choosing the other working fluid. 
(such as nano-fluid) 
(3) Increase the test of different filled ratio and find 
 out the data of the best filled ratio. 
 
Further studies on bonding strength and device 
reliability will be performed.
