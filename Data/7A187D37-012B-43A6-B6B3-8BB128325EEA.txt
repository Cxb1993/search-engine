Equation of motion of structure with SAPTMD 
The schematic representation of the semi-active control of pendulum-like tuned mass damper 
(SAPTMD) is shown in Figure 1. The SAPTMD consists of pendulum and its fulcrum (tube ring), 
actuator and slide. The fulcrum (tube ring) of pendulum is constrained in the X-direction 
(horizontal direction) and can move at any desired position in the Y-direction (vertical direction) 
by actuator. When the fulcrum (tube ring) of the pendulum moves downward, this action offers 
increased stiffness of the SAPTMD; and when the fulcrum (tube ring) of the pendulum upward, 
this action offers decreased stiffness of the SAPTMD. Therefore, the SAPTMD develops 
controllable restoring force due to the position of the pendulum length.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of SAPTD 
A primary structure is modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) structure with mass sm , 
damping coefficient sc  and stiffness sk . The SAPTMD is attached to the SDOF structure and 
the mass and stiffness of the SAPTMD are dm  and sa ( )k t . According to the pendulum length 
of the SAPTMD sa ( )L t  which is the sum of the constant pendulum length L  and the adjusted 
pendulum length sa ( )iL t  of the SAPTMD, the stiffness of the SAPTMD sa ( )k t  is derived as

where g

sa2L  
is
 
adjusted pendulum length for tracking instantaneous frequency of structure, and

Since the stiffness of SAPTMD sa ( )k t  is variable due to the adjusted pendulum length sa ( )iL t , 
the stiffness of SAPTMD can be divided into two parts  
sa d sa( ) ( ) 1,2,3ik t k k t i                                                       (3) 
where sa ( )ik t  is the controllable stiffness of the SAPTMD which is not constant and varied by 
the adjusted pendulum length sai ( )L t . Through Lagrange’s equation, the motion equation of 
SDOF structure with SAPTMD and control force 
pF
 
of SAPTMD can be derived. The control 
energy 
pE  is also obtained by integrating the control force pF
 
multiplied by the adjusted 
pendulum length sai ( )L t . Furthermore, by employing the state space and some assumptions, the 
discrete-time first order difference equation, control force 
pF , and control energy pE  
are as 
follows

Finally, the discrete-time controllable restoring force sar[ ]f n  that is the relative displacement of 
SAPTMD multiplied by the discrete-time controllable stiffness of the SAPTMD sa1[ ]k n  takes 
the following equation

d z d z d z  is constrained by Equation (5) and the term 
T 2
1( [ ])nd z  is 
positive and increases with the stroke (relative displacement) of the SAPTMD. Moreover, the 
gain parameter G  must be negative to ensure the stability of the SAPTMD. For these reasons, 
the term inside the bracket is positive and variable so that the time-variant restoring force of 
SAPTMD is the similar as time-variant viscous damping force with varying damping coefficient. 
In order to determine the optimal gain parameter 
optG  of the optimal stiffness control algorithm, 
the optimization procedures in reference [1] can be used to find the optimal gain parameter 
optG . 
Tracking instantaneous frequency of SAPTMD with variable pendulum length 
In order to eliminate the detuning effect of the SAPTMD, a stiffness control algorithm for 
tracking instantaneous frequency of structure is proposed. It can track the instantaneous 
frequency of structure and then adjust the pendulum length to keep the optimal frequency ratio. 
Since it can deal with the detuning effect, it is named as adaptive stiffness control algorithm. To 
avoid the detuning effect occurred, the frequency ratio 
f [ ]R n  of the SAPTMD must remain the 
optimal value opt
fR . Therefore, when instantaneous frequency of structure s[ ]n  at the n-th step 
is identified by Hilbert transform-least-squares method or relation of maximum structural 
response method [1], the pendulum length of the SAPTMD sa[ ]L n  at the n-th step can be 
derived as

In the numerical analysis the pendulum length of SAPTMD sa[ ]L n  is indirectly achieved by the 
adjusted pendulum length sa2[ ]L n  that is the difference between the pendulum length of 
SAPTMD sa[ ]L n  and the constant pendulum length L  of the SAPTMD.

Substituting Equations (1) and (2) into Equation (3), the discrete-time controllable stiffness of the 
SAPTMD sa2[ ]k n  leads to

cm and 6.54 cm/sec
2
, respectively. The requirement of comfort for building occupants is not 
satisfied because the structural acceleration is larger than 5.00 cm/sec
2
. Therefore, vibration 
suppression and energy dissipation system is needed for the Taipei 101.   
Subjected to the design wind force with return period of half a year, the PTMD installed in 
Taipei 101 is re-design according to the proposed optimization procedures in reference [1] such 
that the acceleration ratio is minimized. The PTMD damping exponent   is set as 2.0 which is 
the same as that the original PTMD in Taipei 101. After re-design, the optimal frequency ratio 
opt
fR  is 0.9755 and optimal damping coefficient 
opt
dc  is 937.86 kN-sec
2
/m
2
. The effective 
damping ratio is 0.069 according to reference [3]. Furthermore, the optimization results for the 
FPTMD by the three-dimensional and contour plots are very close to those by the optimization 
method. Following the PTMD design, time-history analysis of the wind-excited Taipei 101 with 
re-design PTMD is conducted to investigate the response of structure and PTMD. From the 
numerical results, the acceleration ratio is reduced to 0.6986. The peak structural displacement is 
reduced to 5.53 cm. It is about 70.45 % of the one without PTMD. The peak structural 
acceleration is reduced to 4.58 cm/sec
2
. It is about 70.03 % of the one without PTMD. The 
PTMD match the requirement of comfort. Furthermore, the peak PTMD stroke (relative 
displacement) and damping force are 23.05 cm and 20.37 kN, respectively.  
Considering the installation space and funding, the case for the PTMD without damper is 
considered. Through time-history analysis of the wind-excited Taipei 101 with non-optimal 
PTMD, The response of structure and PTMD can be obtained. The acceleration ratio is increased 
to 0.9773. The peak structural displacement is increased to 7.36 cm (Figure 2) and it is about 
133.09 % of the optimal PTMD. The peak structural acceleration is increased to 7.24 cm/sec
2 
(Figure 3) and it is about 158.08 % of the optimal one. The peak stroke (relative displacement) 
and damping force are about 56.29 cm and 0 kN, respectively. Therefore, the semi-active control 
of pendulum-like tuned mass damper (SAPTMD) using optimal stiffness control algorithm with 
exponent 2.0   is adopted to make up the required energy dissipation. After design, the the 
optimal gain parameter optG  is -1391.011 sec
2
/m
2
. Following the SAPTMD design, time-history 
analysis of the wind-excited Taipei 101 with SAPTMD using optimal stiffness control algorithm 
is conducted to investigate the response of structure and SAPTMD. The acceleration ratio is 
reduced to 0.7053. The peak structural displacement is reduced to 5.76 cm (Figure 2) and it is 
about 104.16 % of the optimal one. The peak structural acceleration is reduced to 4.77 cm/sec
2 
(Figure 3) and it is about 104.15 % of the optimal one. The peak stroke (relative displacement) 
and controllable restoring force are about 21.74 cm and 44.02 kN, respectively. The peak control 
force and adjusted pendulum length are about 1.10 kN and 5.20 m (Figure 4), respectively. 
Furthermore, the control energy is 408.7 kN-m. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the hysteretic 
loop is butterfly-shape due to the control algorithm.  
Due to structural damage or design error, the pendulum length of the PTMD may be not 
optimal. Therefore, assume that the stiffness of the PTMD varies 50%  of the optimal one. 
Through time-history analysis of the wind-excited Taipei 101 with non-optimal PTMD, the 
response of structure and PTMD can be obtained. The acceleration ratio is increased to 0.8907. 
The peak structural displacement is increased to 6.97 cm (Figure 2) and it is about 126.04 % of 
the optimal PTMD. The peak structural acceleration is increased to 6.06 cm/sec
2
 (Figure 3) and it 
is about 132.31 % of the optimal one. Furthermore, the peak PTMD stroke (relative displacement) 
and damping force are 15.65 cm and 10.14 kN, respectively. The PTMD with 1.5 times of the 
optimal stiffness do not satisfy the requirement of comfort. Therefore, SAPTMD using adaptive 
stiffness control algorithm is adopted to eliminate the detuning effect. The time-history analysis 
of the wind-excited Taipei 101 with SAPTMD using adaptive stiffness control algorithm (Hilbert 
transform-least-squares method) is conducted to investigate the response of structure and 
SAPTMD. The acceleration ratio is reduced to 0.7011. The peak structural displacement is 
reduced to 5.48 cm (Figure 2) and it is about 99.10 % of the optimal PTMD. The peak structural 
acceleration is reduced to 4.17 cm/sec
2 
(Figure 3) and it is about 91.05 % of the optimal PTMD. 
The peak stroke (relative displacement) and controllable restoring force are about 27.25 cm and 
102.69 kN, respectively. The peak control force and adjusted pendulum length are about about 
1.62 kN and 8.57 m (Figure 4), respectively. Furthermore, the control energy is 144.2 kN-m. It
