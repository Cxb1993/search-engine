Magnaudet and Eames [9]. 
In quiescent pure water which is a low Morton number liquid, the particular range of 
Reynolds number 501 ≤≤ Re  corresponds to bubbles having a diameter between 100 and 
mμ500 .  Unfortunately, experimental study on such a tiny bubble is very difficult as well 
because the surface-active impurities have a larger influence on small bubbles than on large 
bubbles [1].  For convenience, bubbles below mμ500  diameter will be referred to as 
“microbubble” in the paper.  Microbubbles occur in MENS systems, fuel cells, and many 
industrial devices.  They could block a microchannel without a proper treatment. 
Numerous numerical simulations have been performed to investigate bubbles of fixed 
shape, either spherical [12, 13] or oblate-spheroidal [14, 15].  Such a treatment cannot 
properly explore the deformation of real bubbles.  Ryskin and Leal [16] employed a 
boundary-fitted coordinate system on a specified bubble shape to solve the flow outside the 
bubble.  Both shear-free and zero normal velocity conditions (will be referred to as the 
“conventional boundary conditions” in the present paper) were imposed on the bubble surface.  
The bubble shape then was modified such that the force balance equation normal to the 
bubble surface was satisfied.  Drag coefficient was obtained for each pair of given Reynolds 
number and Weber number.  Streamlines for cases of large bubble distortion at high 
Reynolds number and high Weber number were presented.  Similar numerical simulation 
can be found in Yang et al. [10] for three bubble diameters rising in pure water.  The 
distortion parameter λ  obtained by them for the three bubbles diameters 720 mμ , 1000 mμ , 
1200 mμ  are 1.027, 1.116, and 1.235, respectively. 
There are a few numerical methods that solve the free surface problem on fixed 
Cartesian grid system such as the continuum surface force method, the continuum surface 
stress method, the volume of fluid method, and the front tracking model.  The conventional 
boundary conditions cannot be imposed on the liquid-air interface because the liquid-air 
interface is treated as an internal boundary.  It has been proven particularly difficult to 
simulate an air bubble in water of less than mμ1000  diameter with this branch of numerical 
methods, due to “parasitic current” or unacceptable volume losses caused by the improper 
surface tension treatment [17-19].  The situation would be even worse when the bubble 
diameter deceases (or curvature increases).  The purpose of the present paper is to propose a 
new numerical method for the flow structure around a deformable microbubble on a fixed 
nonstaggered Cartesian grid system.  Instead of applying the conventional boundary 
conditions on the bubble surface, the strong pressure jump across the liquid-air interface is 
 4
velocity cU  and the reference altitude refz  are to be defined.  Mathematically, the 
dimensionless density ρ * and viscosity μ * are step functions across the bubble surface.  
They have the value of unity in the liquid region and jump to another constant in the air 
region, i.e. 
⎩⎨

la μμμ                         (7) 
where the subscripts a  and l  denote, respectively, the properties of the air and the liquid.  
Under this particular formulation, the bubble surface is regarded as an internal boundary of 
the physical domain, and thus no additional treatment is needed for the shear stress on the 
bubble surface. 
Across the bubble surface, the pressure jump is expressible as the force 
balance equation [24, 25]

a concave liquid surface.  The bubble surface is represented by

The primes in Eq. (8b) stand for the differentiation with respect to z .  For a rising 
microbubble considered in the present study, the normal stress nnσ  on the bubble surface 
would be negligibly small as compared to the capillary force and the body force.  Hence, the 
pressure jump (8a) across the bubble surface reduces to

The extended weighting function scheme 
The governing equations (1)-(4), the pressure jump (14), and the associated boundary 
conditions (17) constitute a problem of partial differential equations.  In the present study, 
the numerical procedure is performed on a uniform Cartesian grid system ),,( kji zyx , i.e.

that the origin of the coordinate system is at the desired location.  For convenience, let the

by the conventional notations W, E, S, N, B, T, respectively.  In case all of the seven points 
are located in the same phase (either liquid or air), the conventional weighting function 
scheme [26] is employed to discretize the momentum equation (2).  The resulting algebraic 
equation is expressible as

from Eq. (8b).  Figure 1 shows the curvatures for a few distorted bubbles.  The curvature is 
constant ( 2−=κ ) for spherical bubble ( 1=λ ). 
For a given bubble diameter d (or Bond number Bo ) and a tube width β , the 
steady-state solution is solved with a guessed terminal velocity ∞w~  for the boundary 
condition (17).  Once the velocity of the stagnation point )1,0,0(  at the bubble top 
)1,0,0(wws =  is available, the terminal velocity is updated by swww += ∞∞ ~ .  The 
numerical procedure is iterated until 0=sw  is achieved within a prescribed tolerance.  All 
of the computations are performed on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid system coving the 
entire cross-section ββ ≤≤− x  and ββ ≤≤− y  of the square tube.  The numerical 
domain is truncated at 8−=z  and 8=z .  Oscillating wake behind the bubble (if any) can 
be detected through the numerical instability of the solution procedure. 
Figure 2 shows the resulting velocity in the vicinity of the bubble for the case of 
md μ250=  (or 002098.0=Bo ), 4=β  and 1=λ  based on the grid mesh 
1.0=== zyx ΔΔΔ .  The corresponding isobars pˆ  are revealed in Fig. 3.  As expected, 
the pressure variation inside the bubble is negligibly small as compared to that in the 
environmental liquid.  This implies that the pressure on the liquid side of the bubble surface 
lpˆ  is essentially equal to the pressure jump (14) itself.  The surface pressure of the bubble 
generates a tangent water flow along the bubble surface.  For a non-distorted bubble ( 1=λ ), 
the hydraulic buoyancy is the only driven force that pumps the water downward along the 
bubble surface.  The hydraulic buoyancy potential which is proportional to z gives rise to a 
minimum surface pressure at the bubble bottom, and thus induces a downward pressure 
gradient below the bubble (see Fig. 3).  This might account for the upward flow on the 
bottom of the bubble as depicted in Fig. 2. 
The fluid flow revealed in Fig. 2 seems to go across the bubble surface.  It enters the 
 14
present study by monitoring only two points ( °= 0φ  and °= 180φ ) with two parameters 
( ∞w  and λ ).  This evidences that the distorted microbubble under study here is of the 
oblate spheroid type.  Similar treatment (monitoring only °= 0φ  and °= 90φ ) was 
employed in the derivation of Moore’s drag law [7] when the Weber number function 
)(λWe  was determined.  The influence of the bubble size on the distortion parameter λ  is 
shown in Fig. 7. 
The same solution procedure was repeated on a coarse grid system, i.e. 
2.0=== zyx ΔΔΔ .  For both fine and coarse grid systems, the successive-over-relaxation 
factors (SOR) employed in the numerical procedure are 0.2 and 0.8 for the velocity and the 
pressure, respectively.  The computation is terminated when both criterions

the result of the k-th grid point at the n-th iteration.  The resulting velocity and isobars are 
shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.  Numerical results including the terminal velocity ∞w , 
the distortion parameter λ , and the velocity and pressure are found to agree with that from 
the fine grid system within one percent.  The CPU times needed for the fine and coarse grids 
on a Pentium IV personal computer starting from the initial guess )0,0,0(),,( =wvu  are 125 
min and 10 min, respectively.  The ratio is 12.5 times, although the grid number ratio is only 
8 times.

Magnaudet et al. [13] found that the computational domain should be as large as 40≥β  to 
avoid the confinement effect.  Fortunately, the wall effect was reported to be negligible for 
rising bubbles when 8≥β  [21].  In the present study, computations were performed also 
for the cases of 8=β  and 2=β  at various Bond numbers.  The resulting terminal 
velocities for 2=β , 4 and 8 are shown in Fig. 10.  The analytical solutions for ∞=β

In the formulation of the present NAPPLE algorithm, a pressure jump pˆΔ  is introduced 
into the pressure-linked equation (see Eqs. (31), (35) and (36)) on the bubble surface.  This 
is equivalent to imposing a “mass source/sink” on the bubble surface that alters the flow 
velocity on the bubble surface.  The normal velocity should all automatically vanish along 
the bubble surface when a “correct” pressure jump distribution is employed.  In the present 
study, the pressure jump (14) is determined by assuming that the bubble is of the oblate 
spheroid type (41), while the bubble volume does not change under distortion (42).  This 
leads to a velocity field shown in Fig. 4 for the case of md μ250=  and 4=β .  As 
observable from Fig. 4, the normal velocity residual is small but fore-aft symmetric (positive 
at °= 30φ  and negative at °=150φ ).  This means that the bubble is not exactly an oblate 
spheroid. 
To investigate the wall effect on the bubble rising, a moving grid system covering the 
bubble is used while the surrounding liquid is formulated on a fixed Cartesian coordinate 
system as shown in Fig. 11.  The mesh of the surround grid system is five times as large as 
that of the moving grids (see Figs. 12(a) and 12(b)) to conserve the CPU time.  There is an 
overlap between the two grid systems, through which the numerical solutions (velocity and 
pressure) of the two grid systems are coupled.  In the coarse of the bubble rising near a 
vertical wall, the bubble might rotate due to an additional shear force from the wall.  Hence, 
the bubble is allowed to rotate with respect to the moving grid system as shown in Fig. 13. 
Figures 14(a) and 14(b) show, respectively, the resulting velocity and pressure around 
the bubble when the bubble is released in a location near a vertical wall.  The trajectory of 
the bubble centroid is depicted in Fig. 15(a) while the inclination angle of the bubble axial is 
given in Fig. 15(b).  The result reveals that the bubble moves away from the wall due to the 
additional shear force from the vertical wall until the wall effect is negligibly small. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A simple numerical method for surface tension force dominant flow without smearing the 
free surface is presented in the paper.  Performance of the present numerical method is 
examined through an example of a single microbubble rising in quiescent pure water.  Based 
on the numerical result, the following findings are remarked. 
1. Use of the present numerical method prevents the occurrence of parasitic current on the 
bubble surface. 
2. The distorted microbubble is essentially of the oblate spheroid type.

的動態變化，因為毫無規則可循，這是亟待解決之事。回國後，筆者
一再思考這些寶貴的意見。最後決定放棄原本擬以理論分析直攻動態
接觸角的計畫，改為廣泛蒐集有關實驗之氣泡照片並加以分析，目前
已有令筆者意想不到的結果出現。筆者非常感謝本次會議與會學者的
指教。
