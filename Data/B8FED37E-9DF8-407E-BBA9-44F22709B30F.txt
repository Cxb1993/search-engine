2. System Overview 
The solar power management system (SPMS) 
is designed to obtain electric energy from the solar 
system and to make the required power available 
for the on-board computers and other electronic 
circuitries for an experimental UAV. The overall 
system structure is depicted in Figure 2. In this 
research, we use mono-crystalline solar cells as the 
power source. To accommodate the aircraft 
configuration, the solar cell panels are divided into 
three panels, namely left wing, right wing and 
fuselage panels. Pictures of these solar cell panels 
are shown in Figure 3. Under a standard test 
condition, the solar panels will generate a 
maximum power of up to around 57.2W. The 
maximum power point voltage and current are 
around 30V and 1.91A respectively. The electric 
characteristics of each panel are list in Tables 1 to 3.

4. Battery Management 
The battery management system monitors and 
controls the storage and delivery of the energy drew 
from the solar panels. The system block diagram of 
the battery management system is shown in Figure 
7. The system consists of three major subsystems, 
namely the lithium battery modules, an 
auto-ranging power converter, and a charge 
controller. The input power of the battery 
management system comes from the output of the 
MPPT system. The output of the battery 
management system supplies the required power to 
the power conversion system (the last stage of the 
power management system) to provide all the 
required power for the on-board computers and all 
other electronic circuitries.

The battery modules selected in this system 
are Lithium ion (Li-Ion) polymer rechargeable 
battery (HECELL company, battery model: 
H6849D5-4800mAh). A battery sub-module 
consists of three battery cells, the nominal voltage 
is 12.6V and the nominal current is 4800mA. The 
battery management system contains two battery 
modules. Each module consists of four sub-modules, 
arranged as shown in Figure 8. Its nominal current 
is 9600mA and nominal voltage is 25.2V.

the Li-ion battery, the battery is charged at a

panels and transferred to the load are also shown in 
Figure 13. .The efficiency shown in the figure is the 
efficiency of the MPPT circuitry not the efficiency 
of the solar cell panels. The results also show the 
rapid changes of the power when it suddenly 
became clouded.

Figure 14 shows the experimental results that 
was conducted on September 1, 2006. The 
temperature measured on the solar cell panel is 
about C. The power we obtained is lower than 
we got at the previous experiment due to obvious 
panel temperature changes.

Figure 15 shows the results for varying the 
incident angle of the sunlight. We rotate the solar 
cell panel for up to  degrees with a 
incremental of 5 degrees. This is essential for 
aircraft maneuver considerations. Attitude changes 
directly affect the power drew from the solar system. 
This in turn will limit the pitch angle of the aircraft 
maneuver and must be taken into consideration for 
optimal flight path design. The results show that 
pitch angle may be limited to 20 degrees.
