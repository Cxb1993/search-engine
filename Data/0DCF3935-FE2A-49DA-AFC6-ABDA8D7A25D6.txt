Abstract 
  A body-implantable miniaturized and 
broadband stacked antenna suitable for 
biotelemetry communication is proposed. By 
properly arranging a rectangular three-layer 
slotted patch structure, the designed antenna 
with only 10×10×1.9 mm3 can provide a -10 dB 
impedance bandwidth of 50 MHz in the 402-405 
MHz medical-implant-communication-service 
frequency band. Comparing to the reported most 
compact antenna, the proposed design achieves 
not only a more monopole-like radiation pattern 
with a double radiation efficiency of 0.61% but 
also a size reduction of 43%. 
  
Keywords: compact, implantable antenna, PIFA,

1. Introduction 
     Recently, there is growing research activity 
on short-range wireless telemedicine application 
for treating human diseases and monitoring 
various physiological parameters. As the 
physiological signals are wirelessly transceived 
between implantable medical devices and 
exterior equipment at some defined medical-
implant-communication-service (MICS) 
frequency bands such as 403/868/915 MHz and 
2.4 GHz, the antenna, with compact size and 
good radiating performance, suitable for 
implanting inside a human body is thus 
becoming a critical component for the 
biotelemetry communication. To reduce the 
antenna size and broaden the impedance 
bandwidth, the stacked planar inverted-F 
antenna (PIFA) structure is the most used design 
technology. So far, several such kinds of 
antennas have been proposed, including the 
  4
generate radiated power less than 25 µW for 
ERP limitation. This also meets the requirement 
of  ≤ 4.76 mW for the delivered power. 
  
4. Conclusions 
 A miniaturised broadband stacked 
implantable PIFA antenna for biotelemetry 
communication has been proposed and 
implemented. With the insertion of selected slots 
to the radiating rectangular patches, the 
proposed antenna can be designed to have 50 
MHz bandwidth at MICS 403 MHz band, but 
has higher radiation efficiency, more monopole-
like radiation pattern, and more compact in 
antenna size than the reported designs. This 
antenna is robust and very suitable for 
implantable medical devices in order to 
communicate between the biotelemetry links.

Abstract—The performance of a multi-band meandered 
monopole antenna with protruded ground strips for wireless 
communication is presented. The proposed antenna comprises of 
a microstrip-fed monopole with an additional meandered strip 
and a truncated ground plane on the opposite side of the 
substrate. By adding three protruded strips to the main ground 
plane, good impedance matching for multi-resonant mode is 
obtained. Tuning effects of the additional ground strips to the 
different resonant modes were examined and prototypes of the 
proposed antenna have been numerically constructed and 
experimentally studied. The measured results explore resonant 
modes covering the PCS-1800/UMTS/IMT-2000 and the 
2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz WLAN operating bands, a stable radiation 
pattern, and a good antenna gain for this design..

I. INTRODUCTION  
Portable wireless communications have evolved at an 
astonishing rate during the last decade. There is much present 
interest in developing a system with the ability of to integrate 
more than one communication standards in a single compact 
module. To meet the demands, the future communication 
terminal antennas must not only be with a multi-band 
operation, but also have a simple structure, compact size, and 
easy integration with the circuit. Such an antenna can therefore 
be used simultaneously in different frequency bands for 
different mobile services. However, the difficulty of antenna 
design challenges engineers when the number of operating 
frequency bands increases. So far, with the usage of multi-
band characteristics in wireless communication system, many 
promising techniques such as the planar monopole antennas 
[1-3], planar patch antennas [4-6], planar inverted-F antennas 
[7-9], and coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed antennas [10-12] 
have been proposed. However, in these designs, most effort 
was focused on etching the patch shape for producing a multi-
resonant mode and a large plane is usually used for the ground. 
Thus, this mostly results in the requirements of either greater 
complexity in antenna shapes or larger antenna size for 
practical applications. 
In this study, referring to reported work [13], which has 
shown that a microstrip-fed monopole antenna with an 
additional ground strip can excite broadband and dual-
frequency operation, a simple multi-band design of the 
microstrip-fed monopole antenna consisting of a meandered 
strip element and a truncated ground plane with three protruded 
strips is presented. By properly adding strips to the truncated 
ground and carefully selecting the positions and sizes of these 
strips, good impedance bandwidths as well as radiation 
characteristics suitable for multi-band wireless communication 
systems such as the personal communication system (PCS)-
1800, universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), 
international mobile telecommunication (IMT)-2000, and 
2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network 
(WLAN) operations can be achieved. Details of the antenna 
design were studied and prototypes of the proposed antenna 
were numerically constructed and experimentally examined to 
verify the antenna performance, including input return loss, 
impedance bandwidth, surface current distribution, radiation 
pattern, and antenna gain. 
 
II. ANTENNA DESIGN 
Fig. 1 illustrates the geometry of the proposed meandered 
monopole antenna with protruded strips for triple-frequency 
operation. This antenna, which is etched on a single side of an 
FR4 epoxy substrate with relative permittivity 4.2 and 
substrate thickness 1.6 mm, consists of a meandered strip and 
a truncated ground plane on the other side of the substrate. The

GHz resonant mode. As for the case without strip 2, the fist 
(lowest) mode at 1.75 GHz almost unchanged, while the 
second mode becomes vanished and accompanied with a little 
frequency shift (about 1.7%) for the third mode resonating at 
5.8 GHz. Finally, we found if the strip 3 is removed, as 
expected, the lowest resonant mode is destroyed. However, it 
should be noted that in this case not only the first mode but 
also the second mode is affected, unexpectedly. This is due to 
the fact that the strips 2 and 3 were situated very close and 
therefore significant electromagnetic coupling effect appears 
between them. Clearly, the above results show that the three 
resonant modes for the proposed antenna can be effectively 
tuned by properly adding/cutting the three appropriate 
protruded strips to the truncated ground plane. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 4 shows the excited surface current distributions 
obtained from the IE3D simulation, on the radiating 
meandered line for the proposed antenna, as shown in Fig. 1, 
at the resonance frequencies of 1.8, 5.1 and 5.7 GHz, 
respectively. As expected, the three excited resonant bands are 
primarily obtained from the electromagnetic coupling effects 
between the meandered-strip element and the three protruded 
ground strips. For the lowest band excitation, a larger surface 
current density is observed along the longest strip (i.e. strip 3), 
whereas for the second- and highest-band excitations, the 
current distribution becomes more concentrated along the 
strips 2 and 1, respectively.
