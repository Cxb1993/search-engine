However, having the secondary transmitter send its 
own message simultaneously with the relayed signal 
causes interference at the primary receiver and, 
thus, limits the effectiveness of their strategy.  
 
In this project, the use of clean relaying by the 
secondary transceivers (i.e., relaying 
without simultaneous transmission of SU＇s own 
message) is investigated to improve the quality of 
the relayed signal and, thereby, increase the rate 
achievable between the secondary transceivers. Two 
new transmission schemes are considered: (i) clean 
relaying by secondary transmitter (CT) and (ii) clean 
relaying by secondary transmitter and receiver (CTR). 
Our CT includes the work of Jovicic and Viswanath as 
a special case when the clean relaying is not used. 
We will calculate their rates and multiplexing gains 
with full channel state information at the 
transmitter or only its statistics. Our theoretical 
analysis and simulation results indicate that the 
proposed schemes have significant improvement. The 
results of this project improve the performances of 
the state-of-art interference-mitigation based 
cognitive radios, and stimulate more interesting 
researches on this topic.

by
Y2(t) = h12(t)X1(t) + Z2(t), (2)

Y4(t) = h14(t)X1(t) + h24(t)X2(t) + h34(t)X3(t) + Z4(t),
(4)
respectively, where hij(t) is the channel coefficient between
nodes i and j, and Zi(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise
process at node i. We assume that {Zi(t)}nt=1 are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) circularly-symmetric com-
plex Gaussian, i.e., Zi(t) ∼ CN (0, 1). Note that all nodes are
half-duplex.
In this paper, we examine the performance of our proposed
scheme under both slow and fast fading scenarios. For both
scenarios, we assume that all receivers have full knowledge of
its receiving channels. In the slow fading scenario, we assume
that the channel remains constant throughout the transmission
of a codeword, i.e., hij(t) = hij = |hij |ejθij , for t = 1, . . . , n,
where θij is the channel phase. When transmitting, we also
assume that node 1 has perfect knowledge of h14, whereas
nodes 2 and 3 have perfect knowledge of all channel coeffi-
cients. The CSIT at node 2 can be obtained by overhearing
and utilizing the channel feedback sent from the receiver
to the transmitter, as proposed in [4]. The CSIT at node 1
and 3 can be obtained similarly. In the fast fading scenario,
we assume that the channel coefficients {hij(t)}nt=1 are i.i.d.
CN (0, σ2ij) and that only the channel statistics are known at
the transmitters. Specifically, we assume that node 1 knows
only the statistics of h14(t) and that nodes 2 and 3 know the
statistics of all channels (except those they are receiving on, in
which case, full CSIT is available). Similar to [7, Sec. II], we
also assume that SU is able to obtain knowledge of the PU’s
target rate by eavesdropping on the PU’s control channel.
In cognitive radio systems, PUs should not be required to
change their transmitting and receiving strategies due to the
presence of SUs. Therefore, as in [4], the primary transmitter
and receiver, i.e., nodes 1 and 4, are restricted to using only
single-user encoders and decoders, i.e., those that can be used
to reliably transmit messages over point-to-point channels
[4]. Let En1 be a rate R1 encoder at the primary transmitter
that encodes the PU’s message w1 ∈ {1, . . . , 2nR1} into
a length-n codeword Xn1 , [X1(1), . . . , X1(n)] ∈ Xn1 ,
where X1 is the channel input alphabet for the primary
transmitter. Assume, without loss of generality, that the
maximum-likelihood decoder is employed at the primary
receiver [8]. A single-user achievable rate is defined as
follows.
Definition 1: A rate R1 is single-user achievable if there
exists a sequence of (2nR1 , n)-codes that can be decoded with
a single-user decoder at the primary receiver with vanishing
error probability as n→∞.
On the other hand, since SUs are trying to access PU’s
channel, it is possibly beneficial for SUs to encode their
messages utilizing knowledge of PU’s codebook (when it can
be reliably obtained). The availability of PU’s codebook at
secondary transmitter and receiver is for enabling the SU to
decode the PU’s message. Together with the received signals,
the secondary transmitter and receiver can decode the PU’s
messages according to the PU’s codebook, respectively. Now
we can define SU’s achievable rate as follows. Suppose that
w2 ∈ {1, . . . , 2nR2} is the message to be transmitted by the
secondary transmitter and let En2 be a rate R2 encoder that
encodes the message pair (w1, w2) into a length-n codeword
Xn2 , [X2(1), . . . , X2(n)] ∈ Xn2 , where X2 is the channel
input alphabet for the secondary transmitter. We introduce the
following coexistence constraint, which is one of the main
differences between the considered model and the common
interference channels considered in [9] [10].
Definition 2: The coexistence constraint is a constraint that
requires the SU to ensure that, under its own transmission,
PU’s required rate R1 is still single-user achievable as per
Definition 1.
The SU’s achievable rate is defined as
Definition 3: A rate R2 is achievable by the SU if there
exists a sequence of (2nR2 , n)-codes with encoders En2
that can be decoded with vanishing error probability at the
secondary receiver as n→∞ while satisfying the coexistence
constraint.
In the following sections, we denote PU’ target rate as RT ,
and select it as
RT = C(|h14|2P¯1), (5)
i.e., PU’s maximum achievable rate in the absence of SUs,
where C(x) , log(1+x). In addition, improved transmission
strategies based on the clean relaying technique are proposed
to increase the rate achievable by the SU under the coexistence
constraint.
IV. CLEAN RELAYING BY SECONDARY TRANSMITTER
(CT) UNDER FULL CSIT
In this section, we describe the proposed CT scheme and
derive its performance under full CSIT. To improve upon [4],
the CT scheme employs an additional clean-relaying phase to
improve the quality of relaying by the secondary transmitter.
As opposed to [4], our analysis also takes into account the
portion of the codelength required for the secondary trans-
mitter to reliably decode PU’s message when computing the
achievable rates. The signaling in each phase of the CT scheme
is described as follows and is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).
Recall that X1(t) and X2(t) are the signals transmitted
by nodes 1 and 2, respectively, at symbol-t. The CT scheme
employs three phases of transmission that occupy a total of
Lemma 1: Consider a Gaussian scalar channel where the
signals received over n channel uses can be expressed as
Y n = HnXn + Zn. Here, Hn is an n × n diagonal matrix
with the n channel coefficients on its diagonal and Zn is the
Gaussian noise vector. By assuming that Hn is known at the
receiver, then rate R will be single-user achievable if
R < lim
n→∞
1
n
log
( |HnKXn(Hn)H +KZn |

, (9)
where KZn and KXn are the covariance matrices of Zn and
Xn, respectively.
The lemma can be proved following the procedures given in
the proof of Theorem 5 in [11]. With (5), the rate achievable
by the SU with the CT scheme can be derived as follows.
Notice that, with this choice of RT in (5), no information can
be transmitted by the SU if node 2 cannot decode or does
not help forward PU’s message.
Theorem 1: For the CT scheme assume that full CSIT is
available at node 2. The rate R2 is achievable by the SU if
R2 ≤ max
η1, η2, α1, P ′2
η2C
(|h23|2(1− α1)P ′2) , (10)
subject to RT ≤ η1C(|h12|2P¯1) (i.e., PU’s message is decod-
able at node 2) and the coexistence constraint
RT ≤ η1C(|h14|2P¯1) + η2C
((|h14|√P¯1 + |h24|√α1P ′2)2
1 + |h24|2(1− α1)P ′2
)
+ η3C

|h14|√P¯1 + |h24|
√
P¯2 − η2P ′2
1− η1 − η2
2
 .
(11)
In fact, the optimal value of η1 is given by
η∗1 = RT /C(|h12|2P¯1), which is the minimum portion
of the code length required for node 2 to decode PU’s
message.
This result takes into consideration the latency required for
node 2 to decode PU’s message, which is in contrast to the
scheme [4] with unrealistic assumption that the SU can know
w1 without Phase 1 (where η1 is set as 0). Moreover, in [4], the
clean relaying phase was not employed (i.e., η3 = 0) and, thus,
much of node 2’s available power must be used to forward
PU’s message in order to overcome the interference caused
by UD2 (t). This reduces the effectiveness of relaying by node
2.
Following the definition in [12] [13], the multiplexing gain
(or degree of freedom) of SU for a fixed value of P¯1 is defined
as
m2 = lim
P¯s→∞
R2
log P¯s
, (12)
where P¯s is the average transmission power of SU. Note that
P¯s is equal to the average transmission power of node 2 in
the CT scheme, i.e., P¯2 = P¯s (P¯s is equal to the total average
transmission power of nodes 2 and 3 in the CTR scheme (c.f.
Section IV).) From (5), and let (η∗1 , η∗2 , α∗1, P ′∗2 ) be the optimal
solution given by Theorem 1. Notice that, since P¯1 is fixed, RT
is finite and, thus, the coexistence constraint can be satisfied
with finite P ′′2 in Phase 3. In this case, by the constraint that
η2P
′
2+η3P
′′
2 = P¯s, the power P ′2 used in Phase 2 approaches
P¯s/η2 as P¯s → ∞. Hence, the multiplexing gain achieved
with the CT scheme can be upper-bounded as
m2 = lim
P¯s→∞
η∗2C

)+
, (13)
where the last inequality is obtained by replacing η∗1 with
RT /C(|h12|2P¯1) as given in Theorem 1. The upper bound
obtained here becomes tight as P¯s goes to infinity since, in
this case, the coexistence constraint can be satisfied with an
arbitrarily small Phase 3 duration (i.e., 1 − η1 − η2 → 0 as
P¯s →∞). This shows that the multiplexing gain is limited by
the portion of the codelength node 2 can successfully decode
in Phase 1, i.e., C(|h14|2P¯1)/C(|h12|2P¯1). Motivated by this
observation, in the following section we propose the CTR
scheme that improves upon this by allowing the secondary
receiver to share the load of relaying PU’s message.
V. CLEAN RELAYING BY SECONDARY TRANSMITTER AND
RECEIVER (CTR) UNDER FULL CSIT
In this section, we propose a scheme that allows both the
secondary transmitter and receiver to help and perform clean
relaying. In this scheme, node 2 need not always be able to
successfully decode node 1’s message. In fact, whomever is
able to successfully decode PU’s message after Phases 1 and 2
will be allowed to perform the clean relaying in Phase 3. Since
node 2’s transmission may also be used to help node 3 decode
PU’s message, we choose to use coding schemes designed for
MAC with common message [6] instead of DPC. Note that this
coding scheme has lower complexity compared to DPC [14].
Since different coding schemes are used, the CTR scheme
cannot be viewed as a generalization of the CT scheme and,
in fact, does not always perform better. However, we will show
that, with full CSIT, the multiplexing gain of CTR is no less
than that of CT (and its special case in [4]). The advantage is
even more evident in systems with only statistical CSIT as to
be shown in Section VI.
Recall that Xi(t) is the signal transmitted by node i at
symbol t, for i=1, 2, and 3. Similar to the CT scheme,
the CTR scheme employs three phases of transmission that
occupies a total of n channel uses. The signaling in each
phase of the CTR scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2(b) and is
described as follows.
Phase 1: In the first n1 channel uses, only node 1 transmits
while both nodes 2 and 3 attempt to decode the message w1.
Unlike in the CT scheme, n1 in the CTR scheme need not be
long enough to ensure successful decoding at node 2.
Lemma 2: Let Xn and Un be two independent blocks of
length-n Gaussian symbols transmitted through a scalar MAC
and let HnxXn +HnuUn +Zn be the received signals, where
Hnx and Hnu are n×n diagonal matrices with n corresponding
channel coefficients on its diagonal and Zn is the Gaussian
noise with covariance matrix KZn . By assuming that Hnx
and Hnu are known at the receiver, the rate pair (R1, R2)
is achievable if
R1 ≤ lim
n→∞
1
n
log
( |HnxKXn(Hnx)H +KZn |

R2 ≤ lim

n
log
( |HnxKXn(Hnx)H+HnuKUn(Hnu)H+KZn |
|KZn |
)
,
where KXn and KUn are the covariance matrices of Xn
and Un, respectively.
By combining the results in [6] with Lemmas 1 and 2,
one can show that SU’s codebooks can be chosen such that
successful decoding of both messages is ensured at node 3
and that the coexistence constraint is met at node 4. When
deriving the achievable rate, we consider the same setting as
(5). As shown in Table I, we consider three cases: both nodes
2 and 3 can successfully decode, only node 2 can successfully
decode, and only node 3 can successfully decode. From (5),
the coexistence constraint can not be satisfied unless R2 = 0
for the case where neither node 2 nor node 3 can decode.
This case is trivial and excluded. Since the three cases are
mutually exclusive, SU’s achievable rate can be found as
the maximum rate among them. Note that in addition to
the coexistence constraint, Table I also lists the constrained
parameter sets and variable sets under which the three cases
occur, respectively. Then the achievable rate of the CTR
scheme can be found by taking the maximum among the
rates of the three cases as in the following.
Theorem 2: For the CTR scheme, assume that full CSIT
is available at nodes 2 and 3, and that RT = C(|h14|2P¯1).
Given P1, P ′′2 , and P3, the coexistence constraint is satisfied
if
RT ≤η1C(|h14|2P¯1) + η2C

∣∣∣h14 + h24√α1P ′2P¯1 ejθ1∣∣∣2P¯1

|h14|
√
P¯1 + |h24|
√
P ′′2 + |h34|
√
P3
)2)
.
(17)
In this case, the rate R2 is achievable by the SU if
R2 ≤ max{R2,1, R2,2, R2,3}, where R2,1, R2,2 and R2,3
given in (18), (19), and (20) (shown in the next page), are
the achievable rates for the three cases, respectively, with the
corresponding constrained parameter sets Sk, for k = 1, 2, 3,
specified in Table I.
Note that the coding scheme used in CTR is different from
that in CT and, thus, does not always guarantee rate advantage
over CT (at least under the full CSIT assumption). Indeed, if
the same relaying ratio α1 is used for both CT and CTR, the
coding scheme of CT performs better than that of CTR (c.f.
(10) and (18)). However, due to the new channel for clean
relaying from node 3 to node 4, CTR may have smaller α1
than CT, and thus may have rate advantages. Moreover, unlike
CT, even if node 2 is not able to decode message w1, the
coexistence constraint may still be met with CTR by having
node 3 relay the message. This allows the CTR to have longer
portion of the code length for transmitting SU’s own message
and to achieve a higher multiplexing gain as shown in the
following corollary. The multiplexing gain is defined as in
(12), where the average transmission power of the SU is now
equal to
P¯s = η2P ′2 + η3P
′′
2 + η3P3 = P¯2 + P¯3. (21)
Corollary 1: With full CSIT at nodes 2 and 3, the multi-
plexing gain m2 is achievable by the CTR scheme, where
m2 = max
m,
(
1− C(|h14|
2 P¯1)

with m = a, when |h14| < |h13|, and m = 0, otherwise, for
any
a ∈
[
C(|h14|2P¯1)
C(|h13|2P¯1) , 1
)
.
In fact, the multiplexing gains
(1− C(|h14|2P¯1)/C(|h12|2P¯1))+
and m correspond to the CTR scheme using only node 2
and only node 3 to help relay PU’s message, respectively.
Also increasing a requires larger SNR for the generalized
multiplexing gain (GMG) [16] of practical systems to
approach the performance predicted by the MG analysis.
Comparing (22) with (13), we observe that, in the case
with full CSIT, the multiplexing gain achieved by the CTR
scheme is larger (or at least no less) than that of CT (and its
special case in [4]). In the next section, we will investigate
the performance of the CTR and CT in fast Rayleigh fading
channels with only statistical CSIT. The CTR is even more
promising in this setting.
VI. CLEAN RELAYING IN FAST RAYLEIGH FADING
CHANNELS WITH STATISTICAL CSIT
In this section, we derive the ergodic rates achievable by
the SU in fast Rayleigh fading environments, where only
statistical CSIT is available. The achievable rate of the CTR
scheme is first derived and later shown to be better than
that of the CT scheme. Here, the CT and CTR schemes
also follow the three phase transmission schemes described

rate since the channel between nodes 1 and 2 is too bad
such that node 2 cannot decode PU’s message to meet the
coexistence constraint by relaying. However, the CTR may
still have positive rates due to the clean relaying at node 3.
Moreover, from Corollary 1, CTR has a non-zero multiplexing
gain and scales with SU’s transmit power at the high SNR
regime. Thus the maximum gain can approach infinity. The
statistical CSIT case follows similarly from Corollary 2.
VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we provide numerical results to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed clean-relaying schemes. In the
following, we will abbreviate the results of adding Phase 1 to
the scheme in [4] (which is equivalent to CT with η3 = 0) as
JV. The noise variances at the receivers are set to unity, and
the average transmit power of PU (i.e., P¯1 in (1)) is set to 20
dB. We assume that the SU in both CT (including JV) and
CTR have the same average transmit power P¯s, which can be
computed according to (8) (P¯s = P¯2) and (21), respectively.
We define the transmit SNR, which is used in the figures, as
the ratio of the transmit power to the noise variance. Note that
since our system is a multi-user network, it is more convenient
to use the transmit SNR instead of the conventional receive
SNR while the former is usually larger than the latter. We
also set the PU’s transmission rate RT as the capacity of the
primary link in the absence of SUs, i.e., C(|h14|2P¯1) in the full
CSIT case and E[C(|H14|2P¯1)] in the case with only statistical
CSIT.
We first compare the rates measured in bits per channel use
(bpcu) in the full CSIT case. The channel gains of each figure
are listed in Table II where the unit of the phases is radian. In
Fig. 3, we can see that with large enough |h34| as specified
in Table II, clean relaying by node 3 allows CTR to achieve
the best performance. When |h34| is sufficiently smaller than
|h24|, as shown in Fig. 4, CTR may prefer clean relaying by
node 2 over node 3 in the considered SNR regions, that is,
P ′′2 > P3 = 0. Without the aids of additional clean relaying
from node 3, the CT outperforms CTR in Fig. 4. However,
we can find that the rates of CT and CTR converge when
the SNR increases. This is because in the considered channel
setting, the first argument of the upper bound of R21 in (18)
is selected at high SNR. Then the rate formulae of CTR and
CT are the same (c.f. (18) and (10)). Moreover, the considered
|h34| is sufficiently smaller than |h24| in this figure and thus
CTR uses node 2 to relay in Phase 3 (P3 = 0). The α1 of

CTR will be close to that of CT. This result comes from that
with P3 = 0, the coexistence constraints for CT and CTR
in (11) and (17) will be approximately the same except that
there is an additional relaying phase term θ1 for CTR in (17).
However, as long as the transmit power of SU increases, the
effect of θ1 decreases. Then α1, and thus the rate of CTR will
converge to those of CT in Fig. 4. In both Figs. 3 and 4, we

unknown. We modify the recently proposed reinforced belief
propagation (RBP) algorithm [13] so that the LDPC, whose
edge degree is originally optimized for channel coding, is
good for source coding. The codebook of the second stage
of our residual WZC is chosen as a low-density generator
matrix code (LDGM). We also apply the RBP algorithm to
LDGM, which is much simpler than the well-known hard-
decimation-based algorithm [14] for LDGM, and reduces the
overall WZC complexity a lot. More detailed comparisons
between our practical construction and previous works can
be found in Section IV-B.

where v is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

A. Structure of the proposed residual Wyner-Ziv coding
We brieﬂy review the residual WZC in [8], and the coding
structure is depicted in Fig. 1. First, we introduce some
deﬁnitions as follows
Deﬁnition 1: Given a vector x = (x1, . . . ,xn)T and a prede-

where QA(xi) is the nearest multiple of A to xi, ∀i.
Deﬁnition 2 (mod-A distance): The mod-A distance be-
tween two vectors a = (a1, . . . ,an)T and b = (b1, . . . ,bn)T is

[(bi−ai) mod A]2.
The residual WZC is described in detail as follows:
Encoder part: The input of the ﬁrst-stage quantizer C1 in
Fig. 1 is
(αx+d) mod A,
where α is a scaling factor which will be determined later, d is
a randomly generated dither signal known both at the encoder
and the decoder, and A is called as the modulo size. The
entries of the dither are uniformly distributed in the interval
[−A2 , A2 ]. According to Crypto Lemma in [8] [4], we know
that (αx+ d) mod A is uniform in the region [−A2 , A2 ]n and
independent of x. Then the distribution of x, determined by
the distribution of side information ya from (1), will not affect
the quantization result of our residual WZC encoder. The
ﬁrst-stage quantizer C1 searches a codeword −c1 in C1 such
that the mod-A distance (in Deﬁntion 2) between αx+d and
−c1 is minimized, under the distortion constraint 1nE[e1T e1]≤
αD+α2PV . The quantization error after the ﬁrst stage is
e1 = (αx+d+ c1) mod A. (4)
The input of the second-stage quantizer C2 in Fig. 1 is the
quantization error e1 of the ﬁrst stage in (4). The distortion
constraint for the second stage is 1nE[e2
T e2] ≤ αD, and the
quantization output and the quantization error of the second
stage are c2 and
e2 = (e1− c2) mod A, (5)
respectively. Finally, the encoder sends the index representing
c2 to the decoder.
Decoder part: The decoder receives the index representing
c2 and the side information ya. As in Fig. 1, the decoder ﬁrst
computes w = (c2−αya−d) mod A. From [8], equivalently
we have
w = (c1+αv− e2) mod A. (6)
Then we can channel decode c1 from w, by treating
αv− e2 (7)
as the equivalent channel noise, where e2 is given in (5). By
denoting the channel decoder output as cˆ1, we can compute
vˆ, the reconstruction of v, as vˆ= (w− cˆ1) mod A. Finally, the
reconstruction xˆ is
xˆ = ya+ vˆ.
Let the code rates of C1 and C2 be R1 and R2, respectively.
According to [8], by letting α be
α= 1−D/PV , (8)
there exists codebooks C1 and C2 such that the MSE distortion
constraint (2) is met if
R1 ≥ logA− 12 log(2πe(αPV ))+ ε1,R2 ≥
1
2
log(
PV
D
)+ ε2 (9)
R1 ≤ logA− 12 log(2πe(αPV ))+ ε1, (10)

σ2n,ε and D2,ε can be obtained via numerical simulations. From
(15), we know that Ap selected according to (17) is lager than
Aε. Although increasing the modulo size can solve the channel
decoding beyond capacity problem, there will be a loss in the
ﬁnal distortion compared with the theoretically predicted D
using R2 in (11) owing to the increment of the quantization
error variance of e2 in (5) from (14).
Edge degree for SSC LDPC : One of the critical parts
of our residual WZC is the requirement of a practical SSC
code C1. The best known SSC so far is the trellis coded
quantation (TCQ)/modulation. However, according to the sim-
ulation results in [15], using TCQ as our C1 will result in
signiﬁcant performance loss compared with the Wyner-Ziv
bound. Alternatively, in [12], LDPC was proved to be an
SSC code for the binary source/channel under the optimal en-
coder/decoder. However, the theoretical proof in [12] gives no
hints for the edge degree design and the practical quantization
algorithms for SSC LDPC. Recently, the RBP algorithm was
proposed in [13] for the quantization of the binary source with
LDPC. However, the LDPC in [13] is not SSC, since its edge
degree exhibits the ultra-sparse structure which makes LDPC
poor for the channel coding when the belief-propagation (BP)
algorithm [16] is used.
To solve the practical design problem for SSC LDPC, we
propose using LDPC with the edge degree optimized for the
channel coding, and modifying the binary RBP in [13] for
our continuous LDPC quantization with mod-A operation.
Although our edge degree for the ﬁrst-stage quantizer C1 in
Fig. 2 is sub-optimal for the source coding, our simulation
results show that it sufﬁces to make the overall residual WZC
approach the Wyner-Ziv bound. Indeed, our simulation results
in Section IV-A show that our LDPC has a shaping loss [9]
about only 0.5 dB away from the rate-distortion bound when
the quantizer input is uniformly-distributed. Our modiﬁed RBP
algorithm is given in Sec. III-B.
B. Design ﬂow and encoding/decoding algorithms
Our overall design ﬂow is summarized in Table I and is
explained in detail as follows. The Step 1 and 2 in Table I are
described previously in Sec. III-A. To design the edge degree
of the SSC LDPC in Step 3, as discussed in Sec. III-A, we
adopt the EXIT chart ﬁtting approach in [17] to obtain an
LDPC good for the channel coding. By running the BP channel
decoding algorithm, we can calculate the σ2n,ε described before
(15) for our LDPC with the PAM constellation points. For Step
4, the rate of the LDGM is given in (11), and the quantization
alphabet is uniformly spaced with energy α2PV suggested in
[8]. The edge degree of LDGM is obtained similarly as in
[18].
To calculate D2,ε in Step 4 of Table I, we modify the RBP in
[13] as the quantization algorithm for both LDPC and LDGM
at the WZC encoder in Fig. 2. The RBP is a generalization
of BP by adding an reinforcement term controlled by the
constants γ0,γ1 ∈ [0,1] to the marginal L-value calculated from
the variable nodes (VND) of the graph-based code. The main
modiﬁcation of our RBP algorithm is the a priori information
TABLE I
DESIGN FLOW OF RESIDUAL WZC
1: Determine the target (ideal) MSE distortion D:
Given PV and WZC rate R2, determine D from (11)
2: Determine code rate R1 of the 1st-stage quantizer:
Given ε, ﬁnd A= Aε such that ε1 < ε from (12).
Compute R1 from (9) with A= Aε.
3: Find the maximum tolerable noise variance σ2n,ε of the channel
decoder with A = Aε:
Design SSC LDPC with rate R1. Calculate σ2n,ε with BP.
4: Find the distortion D2,ε of the 2nd-stage C2 with A = Aε
Design LDGM with rate R2.
Calculate D2,ε with modiﬁed RBP applied to LDPC and LDGM.
5: Determine the practical modulo size Ap:
Calculate Ap using the RHS of (17). If the LDPC decoder fails,
increase Ap until it succeeds. Test the ﬁnal MSE with the ﬁnal Ap.
from the source. Taking quantizer C1 as an example. We let
ui be the ith element of C1’s input (uniform), and c1,i be the
ith coded symbol of codeword c1. To reﬂect the modulo Aε
operation before C1 in Fig. 1, we use the following conditional
probability density function (PDF) to calculate the a priori
information
fui|c1, i = ∑
b∈Z
fG,σ2n,ε(ui− c1,i+Aεb), (18)
where fG,σ2n,ε(g) is the PDF of N(0,σ
2
n,ε), and Z is the integer
set. The rest of the algorithm is the same as that in [13] and
is omitted here. After obtaining D2,ε in Step 4, we can follow
Step 5, which is described in Sec. III-A, to get the practical
modulo size Ap in Fig. 2 and complete our design.
Finally, note that the complexity of the BP channel decoding
algorithm for our WZC decoder is linear [16] in codelength
(i.e. O(n)), also is the RBP algorithm used in our WZC
encoder. Adopting the RBP algorithm instead of the O(n2)
hard-decimation-based one in [14] [18] signiﬁcantly reduces
our computation complexity.
IV. DESIGN EXAMPLE AND DISCUSSIONS
In our design example, different from the Gaussian side
information in [10] [19], we let each element of the side
information y in (1) be uniformly distributed in [−A/2,A/2].
Due to the dither, the distribution of y will not affect our
performance. The details of our design example is given in
Sec. IV-A, with the distortion performance given in the end of
this subsection. Finally, Sec. IV-B provides more discussions
on our work.
A. Design example with detailed code parameters selection
Following our design ﬂow in Table I, we ﬁrst set PV in
(3) as 0.28 and the WZC rate R2 = 0.953, and then the ideal
distortion D is 0.0747. For Step 2, given ε=0.005, we ﬁnd
that choosing Aε as 3 is sufﬁcient. R1 is 0.68 bpcu. For Step
3, we use 2-PAM LDPC to implement C1 with constellation
points ±Aε4 . To achieve the WZC bound, we choose codeword
length n = 105 symbols per source block. The degree proﬁle
is : check nodes (CND): 100% of degree 12; VND: 35.36%
of degree 2, 44.74% of degree 3, and 19.89% of degree 9. By
applying the BP channel decoding algorithm, we obtain σ2n,ε
as 0.185.
