Table I. Definitions of the variables and parameters in simulation 
Symbols Definition description 
NT The dopant concentration (cm-3). 
Na(za) The absorption population of the absorber fiber, Na1-Na2, (line density, cm-1). The initial 
Na(za,t=0) = NT×A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the fiber core. 
Ng(zg) The population inversion of the gain fiber, Ng2-Ng1, (line density, cm-1).  
n(z),  The number of photons passing through a point location z in a roundtrip time tr, as IνAtr/hν.  
nai(za): n(z) in the za region propagating from za1 to za2, 
nar(za): n(z) in the za region propagating from za2 to za1, 
na(za) = nai(za)+ nar(za),  
ng(zg): n(z) in the zg region. 
Kg, Ka  Coupling coefficients Kg = σg/(Atr), Ka = σa/(Atr). 
pg, pa pg=(1+g2/g1) for the gain fiber, pa=(1+g1/g2) for the absorber fiber, where g2, g1 are the 
energy level degenerations. In simulation, pg=pa=2 is assumed for erbium laser materials.  
α1, αf, α2  Cavity loss coefficients, as the transmission loss 1-exp(-α1) from zg2 to za1, the FBG 
reflection loss 1-exp(-αf) and the transmission loss 1-exp(-α2) from za1 to zg1. 
In simulation, time is scaled by t=k×tr, where tr is the roundtrip transit time and k is a positive integer. In 
every time slice, Ng(z) and Na(z) are solved iteratively by the rate equations:

The pump rate and the population relaxation are negligible in the Q-switching duration and ignored in the 
equations. In every time step, once Ng(z,k) and Na(z,k) are obtained, n(z,k) is calculated accordingly along the 
propagation direction by

The simulation starts from the threshold condition when the gain is equal to the total loss. The initial variables 
and parameters are ng(zg1,0)=1×102, A=1.26×10-7 cm2, tr=18 ns, σg=σa=5×10-21 cm2 and NT=1.38×1019 cm-3. The 
parameters are based on the characteristics of the erbium fiber employed in the experiment. The transmission 
losses of 0.6 dB are assumed (i.e. α1=α2=0.1382 correspondingly). The reflection loss of the FBG output 
coupler is 0.6 dB. The length of the absorber is 10 cm and that of the gain fiber is 70 cm. The simulation result 
is shown in Fig. 2(a). A passively Q-switched pulse has peak power of 1.72 W and pulse duration of 198 ns. 
Three temporal points ta, tb and tc are chosen for later observation, when nai(za2, tb) reaches the pulse peak, and 
nai(za2, ta)=nai(za2, tc)=nai(za2, tb)/100. Figure 2(b) shows Ng(zg) and Na(za) at the moments ta, tb and tc, normalized 
by the initial Ng(zg1,0) and Na(za2,0). It is clear that the SAQS fiber is saturated faster than the gain fiber, and 
well bleached at the end of the pulse. The saturation intensity of an erbium fiber with a core diameter of 4 µm is 
about 0.5 mW at 1550 nm. The inner peak intensity through the SAQS is 25 W. Thus the SAQS is about 10% 
saturated at the observation point ta when the passing intensity reaches 0.25 W, about 90% saturated with 25 W 
and completely saturated after the pulse. The extraction efficiency of the total gain population (Ng integral over 
zg) can be calculated to be 0.93, indicating a highly efficient Q-switching performance.
