for measuring the strategic, tactical and operational level performance in a SC. Shepherd and Gunter (2006) 
provided a taxonomy framework of performance measures. Bhagwat and Sharma (2007) developed a 
performance measurement of SCM based on a balanced scorecard. 
Despite the panoply of approaches and methods for measuring and improving SC performance, relatively 
little research is performed for the construction industry. Most published literature in construction are limited 
to cause-and-effect or correlational relationships between measures (or actions) and SC performance (e.g., 
Briscoe and Dainty, 2005; Ergen and Akinci, 2008; Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008; Jeong et al., 2006; Li 
and Womer, 2008; Loosemore and McCarthy, 2008; Polat et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007; Wong and Wong, 
2008; Xue et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2007; Yeo and Ning, 2002). Little research addresses the development of 
SC performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the construction industry. Hence, there 
appears short of the development of systematic and balanced SC performance measurement systems in 
construction. 
Further, for a balanced approach, while financial performance measurements are important for strategic 
decisions, day-to-day operational control of manufacturing and distributions is often handled better with 
non-financial measures (Maskell, 1991). Although considerable research (for industries other than 
construction) on developing SC performance measurement models in a balanced framework (e.g., Bhagwat 
and Sharma, 2007; Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Saad and Patel, 2006; van Hoek, 1998) has been reported, 
relatively few studies address how to systematically relate metrics from strategic (financial) to operational 
levels. As a result, there appears to be lack of models capable of reflecting quantitative financial performance 
from perceptual operational performance measures. (For example, how much will the profit margin be as the 
perceptual measure of delivery performance is given?) 
Furthermore, although the volume of SC performance measurement models have been developed (e.g., 
Beamon, 1999; Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Gunasekaran 
et al., 2001, 2004; Neely et al., 2005; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Stewart, 1995; 1997; van Hoek, 1998), little 
research performs longitudinal analysis of operational and financial performance measures in SCs. 
Accordingly, there appears to lack the development of SC performance measurement models capable of 
projecting quantitative financial performance based on perceptual operational metrics in previous time 
periods. 
1.2.  Objective of this research 
Responding to these limitations and restricting the focus to the construction industry, we propose the 
development of a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) prototype system for supporting 
continuous improvement of firm financial performance. To achieve the objective of our research, we have 
developed three research questions (see sections 3.1 to 3.3). Answers to each of these research questions claim 
significant contributions to the state of knowledge, and we treat each of them in turn. Collectively, we will 
contribute new theory and empirical insight with solid experiment evidence and relevancy, which in return 
provide management a clear detailed picture and understanding of what to expect with regard to firm financial 
performance while the values of certain perceptual operational performance metrics change.

systematic approach to identify a set of iterative key performance indicators, such as procurement flexibility, 
process improvement, and SC stability. 
Whilst researchers (e.g., Cai et al., 2009; Chalasani and Sounderpandian, 2004; Charan et al., 2008; 
Dehning et al., 2007; Fawcett et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2007 Ohdar and Ray, 2004; 
Ramos,2000; Rungtusanatham, et al., 2003; Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005; Spekman, et al., 1998; 
Spekman et al., 2002; Zailani and Rajagopal, 2005) continue to study the cause-and-effect or correlational 
relationships between measures and SC performance, one group of writers (e.g., Archie and Kevin, 2004; 
Beamon, 1999; Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lai et al., 
2002; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Lau et al., 2002; Green et al., 2008; Gunasekaran et al., 2001, 2004; Neely 
et al., 2005; Neely et al., 2000; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Saad and Patel, 2006; Shepherd and Gunter, 2006; 
Stewart, 1995; 1997; Swinehart and Smith, 2005; van Hoek, 1998; Wong and Wong, 2007, 2008) take a more 
comprehensive approach to SC performance management. This group of writers focus on the design and 
development of systematic and balanced SC performance measurement systems. 
For example, van Hoek (1998) developed a preliminary framework for a SC measurement system based 
on the strategic context and operational contribution of players in the SC competitiveness. Beamon (1999) 
utilized a systematic approach to develop a framework for manufacturing SC performance measurement 
systems based on three separate types of performance measures, including resource, output, and flexibility 
measures. Lambert and Pohlen (2001) used a link-by-link approach to develop a framework for SC metrics, 
allowing to align performance from point-of-origin to point-of-consumption with the overall objective of 
maximizing shareholder value for the total SC and for each company. 
Chan and Qi (2003) further developed an innovative framework that adopts a system-thinking 
perspective for measuring the total SC performance based on fuzzy set theory, providing a means for 
identifying important performance metrics. Building from this work, Gunasekaran et al. (2001, 2003) 
developed a framework for measuring the strategic, tactical and operational level performance in a SC, using 
an intensive literature survey and the result of an empirical study on 21 British companies. 
Recently, Shepherd and Gunter (2006) provided a taxonomy framework of performance measures and 
outlined specific implications for future research, followed by a critical evaluation of contemporary 
performance measurement systems designed to evaluate the performance of SCs. Bhagwat and Sharma (2007) 
developed a performance measurement of SCM based on a balanced scorecard to assess business operations 
from financial, customer, internal-business-process, and learning and growth perspectives, each perspective is 
evaluated using 10, 17, 15, and 12 measures, respectively. 
More recently, Karen et al. (2008) developed a framework for tour operators to use in the 
implementation of SCM processes to improve and assess sustainability performance, using the analysis of 
Deming Cycle of 'plan-do-review' on a sample of industry associations and key tour operators. Using 
Meredith's (1993) philosophical conceptualization, Seuring and Muller (2008) further developed a conceptual 
framework for SC risk and performance management based on an intensive literature review on SCM, taking 
191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. 
This research proposes to develop a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) prototype system 
for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction industry. Multiple reasons 
support the need for developing such a performance measurement system. First, despite the fact that the sector 
(industry type) variable plays a significant role in performance measurement studies (e.g., Evans and Jack, 
6 
 
In particular, SC performance measurement in the current empirical operations management literature 
has relied largely on perceptual measures of operational and financial performance (Ketokivi and Schroeder, 
2004). The values of these perceptual measures, for example, a 5-point Likert scale measuring the degree to 
which the respondent perceives the performance as "extremely low" (=1) to "extremely high" (=5), are then 
used to test hypotheses or to develop models. Despite the reliability and validity of such perceptual measures 
have been rigorously proven by researchers (e.g., Ketokivi and Schroeder, 2004), the perceptual measures, 
however, fail to provide quantitative financial performance measures. For example, how much will the profit 
margin be as the perceptual measure of delivery performance is given, and how much will Return on Assets 
(ROA) be if the perceptual measure of customer satisfaction performance is evaluated? 
Third, despite the panoply of approaches to SC performance measurement models (e.g., Beamon, 1999; 
Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Gunasekaran et al., 2001, 
2004; Neely et al., 2005; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Stewart, 1995; 1997; van Hoek, 1998), little research 
performs longitudinal analysis of operational and financial performance measures in SCs. To the writer's 
knowledge, there appears to be lack of development of SC performance measurement models, capable of 
projecting future quantitative financial performance based on perceptual performance measure metrics in 
previous time periods, although SC operational measures could be a useful predictor of financial performance 
(e.g., Bernhardt et al., 2000; Christensen et al., 2007). For example, through the time series data of a chain of 
fast-food restaurants, Bernhardt et al. (2000) concluded that customer satisfaction is significantly related to 
firm financial performance. Their study, however, only provided the results of the hypothesis tests. Similarly, 
Christensen et al. (2007) concluded that SC lead-time variance is a useful predictor of financial performance 
based on the confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of 210 firms; however, their study only provided the 
results of the hypothesis tests. 
 
研究方法及流程 
In the previous section, existing SC performance measurement models and approaches were extensively 
critiqued. The criticism suggests the following: First, there is short of SC performance measurement models 
for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction industry. Second, existing SC 
performance measurement models fail to provide quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational 
performance metrics. Third, existing SC performance measurement models appear unable to project future 
quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational performance metrics in previous time periods. 
The criticism suggests that much of current basis of SC performance measurement models remains inadequate 
to its task, and new models have to be developed, particularly with regard to the construction industry. To 
achieve this task, three research questions are posed as the following. 
2.1. Research question 1: How does this research develop a holistic SC performance measurement 
(HSCPM) model for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction 
industry? 
As demonstrated in section 2 of this proposal, the sector (industry type) variable plays an important role 
in organizational performance measurement studies. However, relatively few published studies in SC address 
the development of SC performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the construction 
8 
 
2.2. Research question 2: How does this research develop the HSCPM model to project current and 
future quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational performance metrics? 
As illustrated in section 2 of this proposal, the key limitations of existing SC performance measurement 
models are the incapability of projecting current and future quantitative financial performance measures by 
perceptual performance measure metrics. This incapability eventually translates to failures in providing 
management with a clear picture of what to expect and thus how to manipulate while the values of certain 
perceptual performance measures change. To resolve this incapability of SC performance measurement 
models requires the development of new methods. As a result, the contribution is to create a novel approach 
that enables a perceptual SC performance measurement model to generate quantitative and predicted 
quantitative figures of financial performance. 
The methodology to generate this novel approach is fourfold. In the first stage, we will develop a 
longitudinal survey instrument for data collection. The development of this survey instrument is achieved 
through two steps. First, based on those firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange1, 
we will benchmark firm financial performance, using the longitudinal analysis detailed in (Bernhardt et al., 
2000). Second, in conjunction with the benchmark data generated in stage 1 and the survey instrument created 
in research question 1, we will develop the longitudinal survey instrument to bridge (connect) perceptual 
operational performance measures to the benchmarked measures of firm financial performance. 
In the second stage, we will develop nexus between perceptual operational performance measures and 
numerical figures of firm financial performance based on the bridge (connection) found in the first stage and 
ratio analysis of financial statements2 detailed in (Anthony et al., 2000; Wild et al., 2004). In the third stage, 
based on the nexus found in step 2, we will further investigate what relationships exist between financial 
performance ratios in current and previous time periods, providing the foundation for developing a forecasting 
ability of the HSCPM model. 
In the fourth stage, we will formalize and model the findings in stages 2 and 3 to provide the HSCPM 
model with the ability of projecting current and future quantitative financial performance by the 
corresponding perceptual performance measure metrics. This will be achieved by combining time series and 
regression analysis that is well detailed in (Freund and Wilson, 1998; Hanssens et al., 1990; Shumway and 
Stoffer, 2000). The model's formulation will be further shaped using additional guidelines on existing work 
(e.g., 曾惠斌、蕭文雄, 1998; Brandt, 2000; Dehning et al., 2007; Hallowell et al., 1996; Christensen et al., 
2007). 
With the existing methodology of time series and regression analysis (e.g., Freund and Wilson, 1998; 
Shumway and Stoffer, 2000), it is relatively easy to model the relationships developed in stages 2 and 3 for 
projecting current and future quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational performance 
metrics. The challenge comes from how to validate the relationships developed in stages 2 and 3 and, thus, 
ensure that the forecasts and estimation of the HSCPM model are unbiased. Handling this challenge demands 
a comprehensive understanding of design and analysis of surveys and experiments associated with statistical

the Financial Supervisory Commission, a commission of the Ministry of Finance, subordinate to the Executive Yuan of Taiwan. 
At this point in time (2008Q4), there are 55 firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

研究結果討論 
This research project developed a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) prototype system for 
continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction industry. Multiple reasons support 
the need for developing such a performance measurement system. First, although the sector (industry type) 
variable plays a significant role in performance measurement studies, relatively few published studies in SC 
address the development of SC performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the 
construction industry. Although considerable construction research on developing SC performance models 
has been reported, most published literature in construction are limited to cause-and-effect or correlational 
relationships between measures (or actions) and SC performance. 
Second, despite the panoply of studies (for industries other than construction) on developing SC 
performance measurement models in a balanced framework have been reported, relatively few studies address 
how to systematically relate metrics from strategic to operational levels, i.e., linking financial performance to 
operational performance. Especially, SC performance measurement in the current empirical operations 
management literature has relied largely on perceptual measures of operational and financial performance. 
Despite the reliability and validity of such perceptual measures have been rigorously proven by researchers, 
the perceptual measures, however, fail to provide quantitative financial performance measures. Our research 
results provide a solution to this limitation. Third, despite considerable approaches to SC performance 
measurement models, little research performs longitudinal analysis of operational and financial performance 
measures in SCs. Our model is able to project quantitative financial performance based on financial 
performance measure metrics in previous time period. 
In sum, while the research results provide the improvement in financial performance of project-based 
corporations, more research should be carried out to evaluate the possibility of commercialization of the 
model system. 
 
計畫成果自評 
The results of this research project are complacent and are mostly as what we expected. At this moment, 
we are working on several papers based on the research findings. In particular, the development of our 
HSCPM prototype further supports continuous improvement of construction firm financial performance, 
which provides management a clear detailed picture and understanding of what to expect with regard to firm 
financial performance while the values of certain perceptual operational performance metrics change.

The Impact of Payment Terms on Project Contractors’ Contracting Behavior 
 
Dr. Hong Long Chen, Associate Professor, National University of Tainan, Taiwan 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
Project supply-chain (SC) payment management has become an area of interest in construction and manufacturing research 
because managing SC payments is a pivotal component of SC cash flow performance. However, despite the panoply of prior studies 
that acknowledge the importance of SC payment terms to cash flow management, researchers have conducted relatively little 
behavioral analysis of how SC payment terms influence the SC cash flow performance of project contracting firms. Through 
surveys of 118 construction contracting corporations, this study addresses how project contractors, project owners, specialist 
contractors, and suppliers might behave when negotiating payment terms that improve contractors' SC cash flow. The findings not 
only suggest that payment terms greatly affect contractors’ project working capital, but reveal the existence of certain behavioral 
patterns among payment variables and that those patterns influence contracting behavior.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Payment management of projects has become an area of interest in construction and manufacturing research because 
managing payments is an important component of cash flow performance (Carmichael and Balatbat, 2010; Chen, 2010; Hinze and 
Tracey, 1994). Although previous studies that acknowledge the importance of payment terms to cash flow management (e.g., Chen, 
2010; Chen, 2007; Heron and Lie, 2002), researchers have conducted relatively little behavioral analysis of how project contractors, 
project owners, specialist contractors, and suppliers negotiate and behave together.  
Therefore, the objective of this research is to analyze how the project owner-contractor-supplier (or 
owner-contractor-specialist) triad behaves in the context of negotiating payment terms to improve the contractors' cash flow. Such 
behavioral analysis is important, as it provides project owners, contractors, suppliers, and specialists (subcontractors) with useful 
information about how each party might negotiate payment terms to optimize cash flow during the contracting phase of a project. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
Prior studies acknowledge the importance of SC payment terms to planning and predicting cash flows (e.g., Carmichael 
and Balatbat, 2010; Chen, 2010; Jackson and Gilliam, 1999; Navon, 1996). For example, Akpan and Igwe (2001) note the 
importance of payment time lags on cash flows and developed a methodology for evaluating project price variations using 
discounted cash flows. Pujawana and Kingsmanb (2003) present both analytical and experimental studies of lot-sizing rules for 
lumpy demand situations. They conclude that payment terms offered by the supplier to its contract buyers play an important role for 
SC cash flows. Chen et al. (2005) investigates the influence of contractor SC payment terms on cash flows. Based on three-way 
factorial experiments, they conclude that payment lags, components, and frequency significantly affect cash flows.  
Recently, Caron et al. (2007) develop a decision support framework based on the bid/no bid decision and payment terms 
that helps project-based corporations obtain a better balance of the overall portfolio of projects in the engineering and contracting 
industry. Motawa et al. (2008) and Motawa and Kaka (2009) present a model that provides alternative payment terms across SCs in 
a transparent and negotiated manner, creating planned cash flows that meet the needs of project stakeholders. 
More recently, Kwon et al. (2010) examine three types of project payment terms commonly used in practice, fixed price, 
time-based (i.e., price depends on he realized project completion time), and cost-based (i.e., price depends on the actual cost). They 
conclude that time-based, cost-sharing can achieve optimal channel coordination, which in return achieve optimal SC cash flow 
performance. Chen (2010) further quantifies the effects of SC cash flow performance on the financial performance of construction 
project contractors; he simultaneously reports several important behavioral patterns in how project owners navigate payment terms 
with project contractors during the contracting phase of construction projects. 
Despite that many studies acknowledge the importance of SC payment terms to cash flow management (e.g., Carmichael 
and Balatbat, 2010; Caron et al., 2007; Chen, 2010; Chen et al., 2005; Heron and Lie, 2002; Kwon et al., 2010), researchers have 
done relatively little empirical behavioral analysis of SC payment terms. A few studies do clarify contractor behavior concerning 
payment lag, component, and frequency variables (e.g., Chen, 2010; Hinze and Tracey, 1994), but these studies are confined mainly 
to owner-contractor or contractor-supplier dyads. Thus, there appears to be a lack of research that analyzes how the project 
owner-contractor-supplier (or owner-contractor-specialist) triad behaves.

To support the analysis of project contractors’ contracting behavior, this study develops three hypotheses: 
 
Hypothesis 1: The payment frequency of project contractors to specialists and suppliers does not depend on the frequency 
from project owners to contractors. 
 
Hypothesis 2: The payment lags of project contractors to specialists and suppliers do not depend on the lags from project 
owners to contractors. 
 
Hypothesis 3: The payment components of project contractors to specialists and suppliers do not depend on the 
components from project owners to contractors.

Table 5 exhibits the result of the chi-squared test for IH 4 of Hypothesis 1. The table shows that the chi-squared value is 
3.1 and the associated p-value is larger than 0.05. The null hypothesis of IH 4 is therefore accepted, indicating that the frequency in 
contractor payment terms with specialists does not depend on that from project owners when the owners do not split payments.

Chi-Square statistic 2.0 3.1

Because of the rejection of individual Hypothesis 2, Hypothesis 1 is therefore rejected. This study concludes that the 
payment frequency of project contractors to specialists and suppliers depends on the frequency from project owners to contractors. 
Similar conclusions are also drawn for Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3. (Due to space limitations, the tests of Hypothesis 2 and 
Hypothesis 3 are not presented here.) The rejections suggest that the payment lags of project contractors to specialists and suppliers 
depend on the lags from project owners to contractors (Hypothesis 2), and that the payment components of project contractors to 
specialists and suppliers depend on the components from project owners to contractors (Hypothesis 3). 
 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
 
The suggested behavioral pattern for a rejected IH is: While contracting, when a project owner who does not split payments 
increases the frequency paying its project contractor, the probability that the project contractor increases the frequency in paying its 
specialists is high (IH 2 of Hypothesis 1). The suggested behavioral pattern for an accepted IH is: While contracting, when a project 
owner who does not split payments increases the frequency paying its project contractor, the probability that the project contractor 
increases the frequency in paying its suppliers is low (IH 1 of Hypothesis 1). As such, the suggested behavioral patterns are a direct 
benefit to practitioners, providing project owners, contractors, suppliers, and specialists with useful information about how each of 
these parties might negotiate payment terms during the contracting phase of a project in order to manipulate cash flows.
