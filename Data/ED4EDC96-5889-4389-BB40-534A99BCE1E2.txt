that retained the robustness of natural systems (Holland [9]). During the last decade, 
GA, which is a search technique based on the mechanics of natural selection and 
natural genetics, has been commonly used to solve global optimization problems. 
Khouja et al. [10] studied the application of GA for solving lot-sizing problems. 
Poulos et al. [11] derived a Pareto-optimal genetic algorithm for warehouse 
optimization.  
In this study, supplier selection for a single buyer and multi-product with 
stochastic demand is developed. A mathematical model with various constraints is 
derived in section 2. After illustration of GA solution procedure (section 3), a 
numerical example and sensitivity analysis are carried out in section 4-5. The 
concluding remark is given in the last section. 
2. Mathematical modeling and analysis 
The mathematical model in this paper is developed on the basis of the following 
assumptions: 
(a) Multi-supplier, single buyer and multi-product with  
    constraints of service level and budget are assumed. 
(b) Each product is supplied only by single supplier. 
(c) The production rate of each supplier is instantaneous. 
(d) A stochastic demand with a known probability density  
function for each product is assumed. 
(e) Shortage is allowed. 
(f) A single period with a salvage value in the end of  
selling season is considered. 
(g) Fixed cost is not considered. 
 
The following notation is used: 
jx   Stochastic demand of product j, j= 1, 2, 3…n 
( )jj xf  Demand’s probability density function of product j 
aj   Demand lower bound of product j 
bj   Demand upper bound of product j 
P ij   Selling price of product j supplied by supplier i   
jQ   Order quantity of product j

The left side of (7) is the actual service level of product j when Qj is ordered. 
Constraint (9) is to make sure that each product is supplied only by single supplier. 
The number of variables in (6) is mn+n. 
 
3. GA solution procedure 
Using a direct analogy to this natural evolution, GA presumes a potential solution 
in the form of an individual that can be represented by strings of genes. Throughout 
the genetic evolution, some fitter chromosomes tend to yield good quality offspring 
inherit from their parents via reproduction. 
This study derives the number of deliveries per period to minimize the total cost. 
The objective function is ),( ijj YQEP  with decision variables Qj and Yij. GA deals with a 
chromosome of the problem instead of decision variables. The values of Qj and Yij can 
be determined by the following GA procedure:

Two experiments are conducted to investigate the relationships between the 
average expected profit and trials, and combination of crossover and mutation rates. 
4.1.Trials  
The first experiment is conducted as follows: Let population size, crossover rate 
and mutation rate as 30, 0.5 and 0.1 respectively. Run 10 times for number of trials: 
5000, 6000, 7500, 10000, 12500, 15000, 20000 and 30000. The result is listed in 
Table 1. The relationships of the average expected profit with respect to trials are 
shown in Figure 2. One can see that the expected profit is convergent and the standard 
deviation approaches zero when the number of trials is 20,000 or over. The stopping 
rule of this study is set at 30,000 trials.

5. Sensitivity analysis 
 Sensitivity analysis is carried out when the budget or the service level is changed 
with or without the constraint of service level or budget. Two relations are discussed. 
One relation is between the expected profit and the budget used. The other relation is 
between ROI/EP and service level. 
5.1. Expected profit vs budget 
If there is no constraint of service level, the relation between the expected profit 
and budget is given in Table 3 and Figure 4. The expected profit increases when the 
budget increases from $60,000 due to more sales revenue. While, when the used 
budget increases from $91,371, the expected profit decreases due to more units unsold. 
The optimal expected profit is $31,555.67 and the budget used is $91,371. The 
optimal solution is given in Table 4: Q1 is 201 units supplied by supplier 1, Q2 is 276 
units supplied by supplier 4, Q3 is 387 units supplied by supplier 3, Q4 is 311 units 
supplied by supplier 2, Q5 is 151 units supplied by supplier 2, and Q6 is 163 units 
supplied by supplier 1.

demand is developed. Using GA to maximize the expected profit subject to 
constraints of budget or/and service level. Pareto optimal solutions are provided to 
decision maker alternative options of proper budget and service level. We also show 
that the service levels corresponding to the maximum EP and ROI are quite different. 
The results are helpful for manager to make decision.

The second experiment is conducted as follows: Let 
population size be 70 and the stopping rule be setup at 
10,000 trials. There are three levels of crossover rate: 0.4, 
0.5 and 0.6; and three levels of mutation rate: 0.05, 0.10 
and 0.15. Run ten times for nine combinations of the 
crossover and mutation rates. The result is listed in Table 2. 
The relationships of the average expected profit and 
standard deviation with respect to each combination are 
shown in Figure 3. One can see that when the crossover and 
mutation rates are 0.4 and 0.1 respectively, the average 
expected profit is the largest value and the standard 
deviation is less.

5. Sensitivity analysis 
 
 Sensitivity analysis is carried out when the budget or 
the service level is changed with or without the constraint 
of service level or budget. Two relations are discussed. One 
relation is between the expected profit and the budget used. 
The other relation is between ROI/EP and service level.
