disassembly sequence by the total number of 
removed components. They consider the optimal 
selective disassembly sequence to be the sequence 
with the minimum number of removals [19, 20, 21]. 
Although their evaluation function is simple, it might 
not satisfy the demands of many realistic product 
design problems. Therefore, Chung and Peng added 
more evaluation criteria, e.g., disassembly time, tool 
changes, and cost, to selective disassembly sequence 
planning using the wave propagation method [7].  
Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms and 
genetic algorithms (GA) have also been used for 
optimal selective disassembly sequence planning [7, 
23, 24, 25, 27]. Prior methods often consider all 
geometric constraints of the assembly and evaluate 
each selective disassembly sequence, with respect to 
number of reorientations and number of removed 
components, to find the optimal solutions.  
Kara et al. reversed and modified assembly 
sequences and used a liaison diagram to evaluate 
geometric connections to find selective disassembly 
sequences [14]. Aguinaga et al. used a rapid-growing 
random tree method to find optimal sequences. 
However, their method generates many paths, and, 
thus, it takes a significant amount of time to find 
optimal sequences. In addition, their results might 
not be consistent [2]. Shyamsundar and Gadh 
developed a recursive method that considers both 
separation direction and disassembly direction to 
disassemble a target component [18]. Since their 
method allows a component to be disassembled from 
any direction, the input information required 
regarding separation and disassembly directions is 
relatively complicated. Their method also requires 
input information concerning sequential disassembly 
and additional disassembly constraints, which makes 
their method difficult to use for general products. 
Srinivasan and Gadh also developed a global 
selective disassembly method, which includes spatial 
constraints and user-defined constraints [22].  
Most searching methods use specific 
information in their searching processes: geometric 
constraints [2, 11, 15, 22, 23, 26], topological 
positions [7, 15, 22, 26], liaison relationships [14], 
AND/OR graphs [2, 11], precedence graphs [11], 
fastener accessibility [5], and component 
accessibility [22]. Criteria used to evaluate 
disassembly sequences include the number of 
removed components [1, 7, 11, 15, 22, 23, 24, 26], 
disassembly time [2, 6, 13, 14, 25], reorientations 
[23, 25, 27], and tool changes [7, 25, 27]. To reduce 
disassembly cost, most selective disassembly 
sequence planning methods focus on minimizing the 
number of removed components, disassembly time, 
and reorientation time.  
Selective disassembly sequence planning 
research aims to find optimal solutions to the 
selective disassembly planning problem. However, 
finding an optimal solution is a difficult problem. 
Most prior methods either enumerate all solutions or 
use stochastic methods to generate random solutions. 
Methods which enumerate all solutions can find 
optimal solutions. However, they might require a 
tremendous amount of computational resources. 
Therefore, they are generally not practical for 
solving realistic product design problems. As a result, 
most recent methods aim to find near-optimal or 
heuristic solutions. Stochastic random methods, such 
as ACO and GA, might generate solutions which 
meet geometric and topological constraints. 
However, the given solutions might not be practical 
for use in reality.  
This report presents a rule-based recursive 
method for obtaining optimal heuristic selective 
disassembly sequences. The method uses certain 
disassembly rules to eliminate uncommon or 
unrealistic solutions. In addition, rather than consider 
geometric constraints for each pair of components, 
the developed method only considers the geometric 
relationship between a part and its neighboring parts. 
The topological information and fastener 
accessibility of a product is examined from inner to 
outer components. As a result, the developed method 
can effectively find an optimal heuristic solution 
while greatly reducing computational time and space. 
Our method can handle both single-component and 
multiple-component disassembly problems. The 
evaluation function includes disassembly time, 
reorientations, and number of removed fasteners and 
components.

4. Cost Function 
Our cost function for evaluating disassembly 
sequences includes disassembly time, reorientations, 
and number of components and fasteners removed. 
partswionsreorientatwtimewvalueCost ×+×+×= 321   
--Eq.(1) 
In Equation 1, we can choose weight values w1, w2, 
and w3 to establish the weighted importance of each 
of the cost parameters in determining the outcome of 
the search process. The final best or optimal 
selective disassembly sequence which is found has 
the lowest cost value. 
4.1 Time 
Some prior studies use time as an evaluation 
parameter. However, the time values cannot be 
easily verified. Boothroyd et al. [3] reported 
experimental times, which we use for comparison 
purposes. Boothroyd et al.’s reported time values 
consider the effects of part symmetry, grasping or 
manipulating with hands or with the aid of grasping 
tools, and parts which are either inserted without 
being immediately secured, as well as parts which 
are immediately secured by screws fastened with 
power tools [27]. 
4.2 Reorientations 
During disassembly, if the number of 
disassembly direction reorientations is reduced, 
disassembly time is also reduced [23, 24, 25, 27]. 
Since we only consider principal disassembly 
directions, each reorientation requires either a 
90-degree or a 180-degree direction change. For 
example, if the disassembly direction changes from 
+x to +y, –y, +z, or –z, the reorientation requires a 
90-degree direction change, for which we increase 
the reorientations cost function parameter by 1. 
However, if the disassembly direction changes from 
+x to -x, the reorientation requires a 180-degree 
direction change, for which we increase the cost 
function parameter by 2. When no reorientations are 
needed, we set the reorientations cost function 
parameter to 0.  
4.3 Parts 
Many research studies consider the problem of 
reducing the number of components which need to 
be removed. Most prior methods include number of 
components in their cost functions for evaluating the 
quality of a disassembly sequence [2, 11, 15, 21, 22, 
23, 24, 26]. With our cost function, if fewer parts 
need to be removed to disassemble a target 
component, the cost of the disassembly sequence is 
lower and less time is also required to complete the 
disassembly process. 
 
5. Case Study 
Figure 1 shows a gear reducer assembly from 
Scrinivasan and Gadh (2000). To simplify the 
problem, we only considered disassembly in the x 
direction. Figure 2 shows the corresponding DF, DC, 
MF, and MC. 
Following the process shown in Figure 3 to 
disassemble target component C5, after fasteners f1, 
f2, f3 are removed, DC2 is be updated to (C1 : C3,8 :0 : 
0 :  0: 0 : 0 : 0), and MC2 is updated to (0 : 0 : C1,3,7 : 
C1,3,7 : C1,3,7 : C1,3,7). 
By continuing to follow the process diagram, 
one disassembly sequence f1, f2, f3, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, 
can be found. The disassembly sequence includes 3 
fasteners and 5 components. Since Scrinivasan and 
Gadh (2000) did not consider time and reorientations 
in their study, to compare our results with their 
results, we set our cost function weights for time and 
reorientations to 0. Thus, our cost for the sequence = 
0 + 0 + 8 = 8. 
If, in our process, component C6 is chosen first 
instead of C4, the disassembly sequence found is: f6, 
f7, f8, f9, C23, C22, C21, C20, C19, C6, C5, and the cost 
value = 0 + 0 + 11 = 11. 
Comparing the two disassembly sequences, the 
first sequence is better than the second because the 
first only removes 8 elements, while the second 
sequence removes 11 elements. For 
single-component disassembly, in their example, 
Scrinivasan and Gadh (2000) chose component C3 as 
the target component, and they did not consider 
disassembly of fasteners, in which case, C1, C2, C3 is 
the obvious best disassembly sequence solution.

create modular designs. Using their method, initial 
values for the number of modules and content size 
need to be set before the algorithms runs. Later, Gu 
and Sosale [6] used simulated annealing algorithms 
with an interaction matrix of components to form 
modular designs. They only focused on physical 
relationships and design objective interactions 
among components. Falkenauer [11] determined that 
classical genetic algorithms have three major 
limitations: encoding wastes space due to data 
redundancy, generating high quality offspring 
populations is not easy, and genetic operators tend to 
affect the quality of the offspring population. 
 Falkenaur also used group genetic algorithms 
(GGAs) to deal with clustering problems and thereby 
to improve upon performance achieved with 
classical genetic algorithms. Kreng and Lee [12] 
used a case study to illustrate the capability of GGAs 
for modular design. They showed that, using their 
method, different population sizes and genetic 
operators could be modified to affect results. Meehan, 
Duffy and Whitfield [13] used GGAs to explore the 
capabilities of modular design for promoting 
engineering “design for reuse” and developed a 
multi-view modular design methodology to fulfill 
design objectives. Tseng, Chang and Li [14] also 
used GGAs to form product modules. They used a 
cost index and a green pollution index to evaluate 
clustering results. 
However, most methods which use GGAs have 
the same problems. First, they might easily reach 
unreasonable solutions. Second, when the 
complexity of a product increases, computational 
time increases dramatically. To overcome the 
limitations of prior methods, an innovative method 
was developed which uses atomic theory to solve the 
modular product design problem. An atom contains a 
positively charged atomic nucleus and negatively 
charged electrons. Because opposite electric charges 
attract each other and the same electric charges repel 
each other, each individual atom achieves a final 
structure. 
In the remaining sections of the report, we 
describe a new method for modular design. In our 
proposed method, we apply atomic theory to help 
product designers create modular designs, based 
upon design requirements, at the initial stage of the 
product design process.  
Section 2 introduces atomic theory and explains 
how atomic theory can be applied to engineering 
design. Section 3 describes how our implementation 
of atomic theory in modular design. Section 4 
presents a case study, with implementation results. 
Finally, section 5 offers conclusions. 
 
2. Atomic theory in engineering design  
Atomic theory was proposed by Dalton in 1803. 
Dalton established that “everything in nature is 
composed of atoms”. In 1911, Rutherford found that 
an atomic nucleus carries a positive electrical charge. 
Rutherford then established the fundamental 
properties of the atomic theory, which include: 
 
1. An atom is composed of a positively charged 
atomic nucleus and negatively charged 
electrons. 
2. Like positive or negative electrical charges 
repel each other, while opposite electrical 
charges attract each other. 
3. A Coulomb force between charges causes them 
to either attract or repel each other. 
 
Since “everything in nature is composed of 
atoms”, we assume that most engineering problems 
can be solved using fundamental atomic properties. 
In this report, we applied atomic theory to modular 
product design.  
In addition to the three properties above, we 
also applied several other atomic principles. First, we 
assumed that, the positively charged particles in the 
atom’s nucleus are the most important objects in the 
atom, and that the negatively charged electrons 
outside the atom’s nucleus are less important objects. 
Second, a single atom contains both positively and 
negatively charged particles. If the valence numbers 
between the positively and negatively charged 
particles are equal, the atom is called electron 
neutral.  
Finally, in atomic theory, the magnitude of the 
electrostatic force between two electrically charged 
objects can be calculated using Coulomb’s law, as 
12 
between components, which include any physically 
touching components and any connection 
relationships between components: 
0=ijT : component i and component j do not touch 
each other 
1=ijT : component i and component j touch each 
other 
0=iiT  
Thus, the touch matrix T for the product in Figure 1 
is:

3.2 Total Touch Matrix and Valance Matrix 
We define a Total Touch matrix TT, and 
∑
=
=
n
j
iji TTT

, where n is the total number of components 
in the product. We use TT, to show the number of 
touched components associated with component i. 
Thus, the total touched matrix TT of the product in 
Figure 2 is: 
 
TTT ]213422[=  
 
Usually, if a component touches more 
components, that component is relatively more 
important. We define a Valence matrix, Q, to show 
the valences of the components. If component i is an 
important component, ii TTQ = , and, for the 
remaining less important components, 1−=≠ijQ . 
From the total touch matrix TT for the product in 
Figure 2, component 3 has the most touched 
components. Thus, component 3 is chosen as a 
positively charged atomic nucleus with a valence of 
+4. The other components are then considered 
negatively charged electrons. Each electron is 
assigned a valence of -1. Thus, the Valence matrix Q 
for the product in Figure 2 is: 
 
TQ ]111411[ −−−+−−=  
 
Product designers can establish the number of 
positively charged atomic nuclei (modules) desired 
based on requirements for the modules. However, the 
number of total touched components for each 
nucleus needs to be greater than two. Otherwise, if 
the number of the total touched components is too 
small, it would be meaningless to form modules. If 
more modules are desired, more positively charged 
atomic nuclei can be chosen, and, as a result, more 
modules will be formed. 
3.3 Distance Matrix 
A Distance matrix D represents the distance 
between each pair of components.  
1=ijD : component i and component j touch each 
other 
2=ijD : component i and component j do not 
touch each other 
iiD = 0. 
Most components are connected by fasteners, and 
fasteners greatly affect the efficiency of the recycling 
process. If we totally separate a fastener from the 
first touched component, the other connected 
component(s) will also be separated from the 
fastener. Thus, when creating the distance matrix, we 
only consider touching relationships between 
fasteners and their first touched components. For 
example, in Figure 2, parts 1 and 2 are fasteners. Part 
1 touches parts 3 and 6, and Part 2 touches parts 3 
and 4. Part 3 is the first touched component for parts 
1 and 2. Therefore, we only consider the touching 
relationships between parts 1 and 3, and parts 2 and 
3. Therefore, the Distance matrix D of the product in 
Figure 2 is:

If the distance ijD  between two charges is larger, 
the force between them is correspondingly smaller.

Figure 4. Modules formed by the atomic theory 
method for the motor system in Figure 3 
 
touching relationships would be chosen to be 
positively charged atomic nuclei. The resulting 
Touch matrix T, Total Touch matrix TT, and 
Valence matrix Q are shown in Table 1. From 
the Touch matrix, there are four positively 
charged atomic nuclei which touch more than 3 
components, which are parts 1, 7, 9 and 12. The 
rest of the components were assigned to be 
negatively charged electrons. The Distance 
matrix, D, is shown in Table 2. 
4.2 Force Matrix 
From the Valence matrix Q, we know that 
parts 1, 7, 9 and 12 are positively charged 
atomic nuclei and the rest of the components are 
negatively charged electrons. The k value in 
Equation 2 is generally set to be one. However, 
when some positively charged atomic nuclei 
have the same valence value, in Valence matrix 
Q, the value of k is increased sequentially for the 
given components. 
The Force matrix F can be easily 
calculated. For example, the force between 
components 7 and 9 is

the Force matrix of this case study is shown in 
Table 3. 
4.3 Maximum Force Matrix 
 From the Force matrix, the Maximum 
Force matrix, MF, can be obtained:

From Maximum Force matrix, we know 
that MF12= MF15= MF16= +4; MF1= MF17= 
MF18= MF19= MF20=+5; MF2= MF8= MF9= 
MF10= MF11=+11, MF3= MF4= MF5= MF7= 
MF14=+6; MF6=+1; MF13=+1. Since 
components which have more than 3 touched 
components are assigned positive valences, the 
minimum force should be:

Here, the force values for MF6 and MF13 
are less than 4. Therefore, MF6 and MF13 can be 
regarded as two individual modules. Thus, the 
resulting modules are [1,17,18,19,20], 
[2,8,9,10,11], [3,4,5,7,14], [12,15,16], [6],[13], 
as shown in Figure 4. 
From the results, parts 7 and 14 are in the 
same module. Part 7 is a worm and part 14 is a 
worm gear. However, from the original design, 
it’s apparent that, during the assembly process, 
parts 7 and 14 are difficult to assemble because 
part 14 needs to be inserted through the holes in 
parts 12 and 9 to be joined to part 7. Thus, 
designers should strive to redesign the module 
to improve assemblability of the given product. 
For example, parts 9 and 12 can be redesigned 
by removing material above the lower half of 
the holes, so that the worm and worm gear could

PART III: OPTIMIZING PRODUCT 
CONFIGURATIONS FOR GREEN 
PRODUCT DESIGN  
 
1. Introduction  
In the current modern market, the life-cycle 
of most products is short, due to severe market 
competition, advances in technology, and variety 
of available products. Under such conditions, 
waste problems arise. Many methods have been 
developed to solve the problems. However, 
much research still focuses on recycling, 
disassembling, and waste classification of an 
existing product, which cannot effectively 
reduce waste from end-of-life products. Since 
product spatial configuration determines the 
ease of maintenance and disassembly, a more 
effective way to reduce waste is to examine 
product spatial configuration in the initial design 
stage. For example, if customers or service 
personnel need to replace a certain component 
regularly, a good product configuration should 
provide an easy access to the component. If the 
product configuration causes difficulty in 
disassembling the component, customers may 
just throw the product away. 
Product disassembly is defined as an 
organized process to take apart a systematically 
assembled product [1]. Products may be 
disassembled into subassemblies during its 
retirement stage. Disassembly sequence 
planning has been studied by many researchers. 
A good disassembly sequence planning reduces 
product lifecycle cost and increases product 
value [2]. Usually, it is uneconomical and 
impractical to disassemble a whole product if 
only a few components need to be reused, 
recycled or remanufactured. Under such 
condition, selective disassembly is a better 
solution. A selective disassembly sequence for a

this report, a fifth parameter flow is defined: else 
function (ES). If I/O function cannot be 
categorized into any of the four types, it will be 
classified into ES. In this research, the inputs 
from and outputs to the outer environment are 
not considered. 
The parameter flows include 
non-directional flow and directional flow. The 
latter contains one-directional and 
two-directional flows. Here, a functional net 
(FN) graph is defined to show the parameter

For the given product configuration, 
component H (sensor) is the target component 
which has to be maintained regularly. The given 
selective disassembly sequence for component 
H is: 3 (+z)  4 (+z)  5 (+z)  K (-z)  F 
(+z)  C (-y)  6 (+y)  7 (+y)  I (+y)  H

3.1 Redesign of Components 
From the FN graph and the original 
configuration, product design engineers can 
determine whether it is able to relocate a 
component. In the case, if component H is to be 
relocated, components which have direct 
parameter flows with H need to be examined. 
They are components C, F, G, and I. 
Components C and F are connected to H. The 
relationships still need to be maintained even if 
H is not at the original location. Components G 
and I are used to fix H. If H moves to another 
location, the relationships can be replaced by 
other methods. Thus, redesign the location of H 
is acceptable and the parameter flows between 
component H and components G and I can be 
redesigned. The redesign analysis is listed in 
Table 7. 
Here proposes a conceptual redesign 
configuration, as shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6, 
component H is installed and fixed by a snap fit 
on one side of component K. The design 
changes shown in Figure 6 are listed: 
1. Fasteners 3, 4, 5 are replaced by a snap fit to 
connect components K and G.  
2. Fasteners 6, 7 and component I are replaced 
by a snap fit to connect components K and 
H. 
3. Component G is modified due to the 
location change of component H.

Figure 1. Using AR in geometric difference checking. 
At the end of the Symposium, there was a panel discussion. A mailing list, 
W3C POI WG, was formed for participants to communicate each other 
concerning their research. Researchers also discussed about the future trend 
in AR. For example, the tracking method has shifted from marker-based to 
natural feature-based. Figure 2 shows the Gartner’s hype cycle of AR. 
Figure 3 shows an image of the paper which got the Best Paper Award. The 
author developed a real-time natural feature-based tracking method. 
During the expert panel discussion, AR researchers agreed that using 
HMDs will be the future trend for AR applications, due to their portability 
and usability, although current HMD technology is still not fully mature 
and users might complain about comfort and use, e.g., sore necks, or HMDs 
falling off, when wearing them. However, the hardware technology

3. Conclusion 
During this trip, I learned a lot of new technologies and applications in the 
areas of MR and AR. Although there were only 24 papers accepted for 
presentation, there were about 300 participants in the conference. Figure 4 
was taken during the conference. I met several professionals in the AR and 
MR areas. I also got several new research ideas during the conference. It 
was a very fruitful and informative trip for me.
