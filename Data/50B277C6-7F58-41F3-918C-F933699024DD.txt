Inamura et al [26-28]發表在準靜態條件時震動原子的平均位置的改變即是最小能量位置之
奈米模擬加工模式，所用的條件仍是剛體刀具在真空的環境下對材料進行加工。Inamura et al 
[26-28]視原子為節點，且結合 Morse potential 以計算原子間之作用。以此為基礎，他們歸納出
原子級的有限元素法，且用兩種原子的 Morse potential 來當模擬例子，最後得到切削的形成的
改變現象，切削的性能。 
為了計算切削時工件之等效應力場，所以 Lin and Huang [29]、Lin et al.[30]發展出結合分子
動力學與有限元素法之奈米級正交切削模式，在此模式是剛體刀具在真空中採增量式逐步往前

由以上文獻探討可知，大多的文獻模擬奈米加工所用的條件是剛體刀具在真空的環境下對
材料進行加工。工件因加工所產生熱量，皆是在工件之底部設計一個溫度控制層來模擬工件之
熱傳。而國際文獻針對切削產生溫度場之探討較少見，且將刀具視為剛體就無法分析加工時之
刀具溫度變化與磨耗情況，因此導入一個更能普遍適用於各種晶格、差排缺陷、粗糙表面的材
料條件的應力計算模式是需要的。本研究擬建立一個考慮熱傳導與熱輻射效應的奈米切削加工

現象乃是國際文獻常用之方法，亦即在銅工件之自由移動區與剛體邊界層間之一層原子視為恆
溫原子(thermostat atoms)，亦即將此層之原子設為溫度控制層(Temperature controlled layers)，以
吸收朝向主胞室之熱傳。當溫度吸收層之溫度高於所設定之銅工件設定之溫度時，即以方程式

彈性體鑽石刀具並非奈米鑽石薄膜，故其熱傳方式並不需要使用聲子熱傳[39]理論來計算，
因此本計畫彈性體鑽石刀具之熱傳導方式仍是以溫度吸收層之方式來達成熱傳導。其計算過程
如上述銅材料之處理方式。本計畫先以單顆原子的動能直接轉換並先假設為單顆原子溫度(T

熱輻射係指特定溫度下的物體藉由電磁波和環境作能量交換[40]，材料放射率(emissivity)實
際上會隨著材料的波長、溫度與表面狀況而改變，因此為方便分析，因此本文將銅工件與彈性
體鑽石刀具視為理想灰體(gray body)，放射率(emissivity)取不同波長輻射比的積分之平均值，由
文獻[41]可查出在銅材料與碳的平均放射率，如此即可用於計算銅工件與彈性體鑽石刀具在加工
時因熱輻射所損失之能量。 
本文不考慮工件與刀具間熱輻射的交互影響，因此僅在刀具與工件的自由表面方考慮熱輻
射效應。本文以 centrosymmetry (CSP) 參數[42]的分析確認出表面原子的原子總數與分布位置，
即可計算出銅工件表面區域的大小，在將其值減去刀具與工件的交接面區域，以可計算出工件
之自由表面。 
 
3.2 原子級應力計算模式 
在奈米加工時，刀具與銅工件的應力分布是重要加工訊息，而在奈米尺度時，應力的計算
與巨觀並不相同，所以本計畫擬以BDT stress[43]來探討在奈米加工時刀具與銅工件的應力分布。 
BDT stress是在1971年由Basinski、Duesberry以及Taylor [43]所提出原子級應力計算方式，此
方法當材料為均質的假設下，且計算出單一原子應力，其計算式如下所示：

Abstract 
Five nanostructured Cr2N/Cu multilayer coatings were deposited by a bipolar asymmetric 
reactive pulsed DC magnetron sputtering system, and various bilayer periods (Λ) were achieved by 
controlling the holding time of Si substrates in the plasma of Cr or Cu. The hardness and elastic 
modulus of multilayer coatings were investigated by means of a nanoindenter. Nano-scratch and 
nano machining experiments on multilayered coatings were conducted using atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) in air and DI-water, respectively. According to the groove depth, width and 
coefficient of friction (COF) obtained from nano-scratch tests, influences of scratch cycles number 
and bilayer periods on the scratchability of Cr2N/Cu multilayered thin films were examined. 
It was observed that the bilayer periods of the nanostructured multilayered coatings were 
controlled ranging from 5 to 20 nm. After nano-scratch experiments in air and water, the COF 
values increased with increasing bilayer period. A same tendency was also observed on the 
relationship between the amount of material removed and COF values. After nano-machining tests 
in air and water, different types of the cutting chip pile-ups were observed. In this work, the surface 
tribological properties and machinability of Cr2N/Cu multilayered thin films by using an AFM were 
discussed. 
Keyword: Cr2N/Cu, multilayer, AFM, nano-scratch, nano-machining, nano-pattern, machinability 
1. Introduction 
Since the TiN/VN superlattices coatings with hardness value exceeding 50GPa were developed 
 3
work [2]. Five multilayered thin films were deposited by alternately rotating the substrates from the 
plasma of Cr target to the plasma of Cu target. The target power values of Cr and Cu were adjusted 
to achieve a fixed thickness ratio of Cr2N/Cu around 9:1. Various bilayer periods, Λ, were achieved 
by controlling the holding time of Si substrates in the plasma of Cr or Cu. Typical deposition 
conditions of Cr2N/Cu bilayers and designation for each coating are listed in Table 1. 
The hardness and elastic modulus of multilayered thin films were investigated by a 
nanoindenter (Triboscope, Hysitron, USA) using a Berkovich 142.3o diamond probe at a maximum 
applied load of 4 mN. The surface roughness of each coating was investigated by an AFM (DI 3100, 
Veeco, USA).  
2.2 AFM probe preparation 
A doped diamond coated probe (VEECO, DDESP-10) was used for AFM scratching test. To 
obtain an accurate normal spring constant, Kn, the resonance frequency, f, of the probe was 
measured based on the following equation [10]: 
K
K
f
f n=0    (1) 
where f0 and K are resonance frequency and normal spring constant provided by the manufacturer, 
equal to 410KHz and 80 N/m, respectively, for DDESP-10 doped diamond coated probe. The f and 
Kn are the resonance frequency of measurement and the actual normal spring constant, equal to 
413.01KHz and 81.18 N/m, respectively. The probe dimensions were determined by scanning 
electron microscopy and showed in Fig. 1. The length of cantilever, tip height and tip radius are 
111.63 μm, 15.67 μm and 50 nm, respectively. 
2.3 Normal force and friction force measurements 
The normal (loading) force, FN, was calculated from force-displacement curves (f-d curve) 
obtained by recording the deflection signal of the probe during the tip approach and retraction. The 
deflection signal was then converted to force (FN) and distance (D) curves using probe stiffness,  
FN = KNd (where FN is the loading force, KN is the probe spring constant, and d is the deflection of 
the probe measured as a distance).

same loading force and scratch speed. The scratch and machining directions were perpendicular to 
the longitudinal axis of the probe. All the experiments were made at 25oC and 25% relative 
humidity.  
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Hardness and roughness 
The hardness and elastic modulus value of coatings are listed in table 1. For the L12 coating, 
the maximum hardness and elastic modulus values of 17.2GPa and 210.6GPa are reached, 
respectively, whereas the minimum hardness value, 15.3GPa, of L20 coating is found. The hardness 
increases with decreasing bilayer period and reaches a maximum value at Λ= 12 nm and levels off 
at Λ= 6-12 nm, followed by a drastic decrease when the bilayer period decreases to 5 nm, 
apparently. On the other hand, the average surface roughness, Ra, of each coatings is also listed in 
table 1. A rather low surface roughness with a Ra=0.69 nm is found on the L5 coating. It can be 
seen that the surface roughness increases with increasing bilayer period. 
3.2 The effect of scratch cycle 
The cross-sectional profiles of coatings after scratch for 10 cycles in air and water are 
illustrated in Fig. 2. The values of groove depth (d) and full width at half maximum (wf) from these 
profiles can be calculated and listed in table. 2. For scratched in air, the maximum groove depth and 
width values of 3.57 nm and 49.13 nm are reached on the L8 coating, respectively, whereas the 
minimum groove depth and width values, 1.24 nm and 24.17 nm, of L6 coating is found. For 
scratched in water, the maximum groove depth and maximum width values of 1.62 nm and 76.22 
nm are observed on the L20 and L12 coating, respectively.  
In order to evaluate the amount of material removed, the scratch coefficient, ks, is calculated [6, 
7, 14]. The ks is defined as: 
V = d wf L            (5) 
k s = V/(LFn) = dwf/Fn   (6) 
where the V and L are the scratch volume and length. The Fn is the loading force. The ks value is

were executed to discuss the influence of scratch parameters on the coefficient of friction. The COF 
versus scratch speed in air and water are showed in Fig. 4. The COF value decreases with 
increasing scratched speed and reaches a maximum value, 1.63, at a scratch speed of 0.1 μm/s in 
scratched in air. It indicates that a higher scratch speed will reduce the friction force between the 
sample and probe. In addition, a different trend is observed on the scratch test in water. The COF 
value in water is significantly higher than that in air, and increases with increasing scratch speed. It 
might be attributed that the water resistance increased with increasing scratch speed due to the 
increasing twisty angle of cantilever, which could cause the COF values to increase accordingly. 
Also, the loading force decreased due to the buoyancy by the water. 
3.4 The nano-machining pattern 
To investigate the machining property on multilayered coatings, the L5 coating is selected to 
fabricate nano-patterns in air and water. Fig. 5 and 6 depict the AFM images of surface 
morphologies of L5 coating after nano-machining in air and water, respectively. The cutting chips 
were push by the tip to the upon and the lower parts of the pattern after scratched in air. It is caused 
due to the machining direction is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the probe. The SEM 
morphology is also inserted in Fig. 5 and the cutting chips are found obviously. On the other hand, a 
different type of cutting chip pile-up is observed after machining in water. Randomly distributed 
cutting chips are found adjacent to the machining pattern. It is suggested that cutting chips were 
agitated by water during nano-machining process in water. In this work, the nano-patterns were 
manufactured in air and water by an AFM tip successfully. 
4. Conclusion 
Nanostructured Cr2N/Cu multilayered coatings with bilayer thickness ranging from 5 nm to 20 
nm were deposited periodically by a bipolar asymmetric pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering 
technique. The nanoscale scratch and machining experiments had been performed by using an AFM 
with diamond-coated probes on multilayered coatings. The tribological and machining properties of 
multilayered coatings were also investigated in different environments successfully. It was observed

The maximum ks value of 3.5 nm2/μN is observed on the L8 coating, 
whereas the minimum ks value, 0.6 nm2/μN, of L6 coating is found. It

Results and Discussion
The effect of scratch speed
Scratch speeds ranging from 0.1 to 5 μm/s with a 
contact loading force of 50 μN on L5 coating were 
executed.
The effect of scratch speed

The COF value decreases with increasing scratch speed when 
scratched in air. 
It indicates that a higher scratch speed will reduce the friction force 
between the sample and probe.

In addition, a different trend is observed on the scratch test in water. 
The COF value in water is significantly higher than that in air, and 
increases with increasing scratch speed.

Conclusions
It was observed that the number of scratch cycles had no 
significant effect on the COF values. Beside, obvious 
increase of COF was observed for each coating when 
scratched in water.
A same tendency was also observed on the scratch 
coefficient, ks, which was defined in terms of the amount 
of material removed.
On the contrary, the maximum ks values were found on 
the high hardness L8 and L12 coatings. It indicates that 
the hardness can not be completely represented the 
material removed in nano-scratch test.
44
Conclusions
On the other hand, a higher scratch speed reduced the 
COF values. Indicating a higher scratch speed would 
reduce the friction force between a sample and probe. 
In this work, Cr2N/Cu multilayered coatings with adequate 
machinability was achieved successfully, which showed 
promising applications in the fabrication of nano-pattern 
on the nano-scale.

property. The size of reinforcement reduces from micrometer to nanometer, because the progress of 
nanotechnology. Carbon Nanotube (CNT) was discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991[1]. CNT is 
valued as the most potential strengthening material by its high strength, well-flexible, larger ratio of 
length to diameter and lower density. The application of CNT on nanocomposite materials has 
become promising and successful in the last decades. 
Lourie and Wagner [2] examined the fragmentation of multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) in 
polymer films and estimated that the MWNT–matrix stress transfer efficiency was at least one order 
of magnitude larger than that of conventional fiber-based composites. Cooper et al. [3] concluded 
that the effective modulus of SWNTs dispersed in a composite (epoxy resin/nanotube mixture) 
could be over 1 TPa and that of MWNTs was about 0.3 TPa. Qian et al. [4,5] reported that 1 wt.% 
CNT additions in a PS matrix resulted in 36–42% and ca. 25% increases in elastic modulus and 
breaking stress. Ajayan et al. [6] suggested that the nearly constant value of the Raman peak in 
tension was related to tube sliding within the nanotube ropes and indicated poor interfacial load 
transfer between the nanotubes. Schadler et al. [7] studied the load transfer of MWNT/epoxy 
composites in tension and compression. They found that the compressive modulus higher than the 
tensile modulus of the composites, and the Raman peak shifted only in compression. These findings 
suggested that during load transfer only the outer layers were stressed in tension because of inner 
wall sliding effects, whereas all layers responded in compression. From the above indirect 
experimental measurements, the accurate value of the interfacial strength could not be obtained. 
Cooper et al. [8] directly measured the interfacial strength by drawing out individual SWNT ropes 
and MWNTs bridging across holes in an epoxy matrix using a scanning probe microscope tip. 
Based on these experiments, the interfacial shear strength between the MWNTs and the epoxy 
matrix were calculated to be in the range of 35–376 MPa, whereas most of SWNT ropes were 
fractured instead of being pulled out of the epoxy matrix. Wagner [9] applied an expanded form of 
Kelly–Tyson model by modifying for a hollow tube to calculate the interfacial strength between the 
SWNT and polymer. It was shown that high values of the interfacial strength are attainable. Lau et

in Fig. 2. In Fig. 3 the formation of a cross-link between epoxy resin and curing agent can be found. 
The molecule continued to react with another epoxy molecule at the site of HN and formed 
cross-link at the atom N [12]. We extend the length of epoxy chain to triple, in order to have 
polymer characteristics, and the molecular model of cured epoxy resin shown in Fig. 4. 
2.3 Molecular model of nanocomposite 
The nanocomposite model was composed of SWNT/cured epoxy resin. The model of 
nanocomposite with 7260 atoms which consisted of a supercell in the range of 50Å×50Å×100Å is 
shown in Fig. 5. To make a reasonable nanocomposite model and find low energy adsorption sites, 
the Monte Carlo method was used in this study. A conjugate-gradient method was employed to relax 
the nanocomposite to its local potential energy minimization. The model was put into an NVT 
ensembles simulation with no external stress, and temperature of 298 K for 20ps (the time step was 
1fs) using the COMPASS force field. The purpose of this step was to generate initial amorphous 
matrix. The simulation temperature was then set to 298 K, for another 25ps to generate more 
reasonable model of SWNT/epoxy resin composite. Then, a constant-strain minimization was 
carried out with strain being varied from 0% to 3% in discrete steps, as described in Section 3.2.  
3.Simulation methodology 
A standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method was applied to construct the atomistic 
models of the SWNT/ cured epoxy resin. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to the models 
along both the SWNT axis and transverse directions. In this study, the potential function is 
COMPASS potential, MD simulation were carried out by the Forcite module in Materials Studio® 
(Accelrys Software Inc.)[13]. After equilibration at setting temperature, a constant-strain energy 
minimization method was applied to calculate the Young’s modulus and interfacial energy of 
nanocomposite from MD simulation.  
3.1 Calculation of the SWNT/epoxy interfacial energy 
In the nanocomposite, the bonding strength between the nanotube and epoxy resin can be 
evaluated by interfacial bonding energy. The nature of interfacial bonding energy comes from the 
 6
obvious larger than the epoxy alone. According this result, the nanocomposite can be strengthened 
by the addition of SWNT in epoxy. 
4.2 Influence of chiral angle SWNT on nanocomposite interfacial energy 
The interaction energy of the SWNT/cured epoxy resin composite was calculated according to 
Eq. (1) and listed in Table 2. This case, the interaction energy came from both van der Waals and 
electrostatic interactions between the SWNT and cured epoxy resin. The negative values of 
interaction energies were assumed to be attractive forces between the SWNT and cured epoxy resin. 
The electrostatic forces resulted from columbic attraction between the positive hydrogen on both 
ends of the SWNT and cured epoxy resin. However, carbon atoms of the SWNT were neutrally 
charged. Therefore, the electrostatic forces were much smaller than the van der Waals forces. From 
the Table 2, it can be found that the total interfacial energy between the (6, 6) SWNT and cured 
epoxy resin was larger. Both Table 1 and Table 2 presented that total interfacial energy and 
interfacial energy in unit area increase with increases the chiral angle of SWNTs. It could also 
explain strengthen of nanocomposite was better with larger chiral angle of SWNTs.  
4.3 Effects of temperature on strengthening phenomena of nanocomposite 
To consider the influences of the system temperature on strengthening phenomena of the 
(6,6)SWNT/cured epoxy resin, the nanocomposite was set at 298K, 403K and 473K, respectively, 
to evaluate the Young’s modulus in Z axis. After simulation, as shown in Fig. 6, the results were 
30.1554 GPa, 31.1492 GPa and 31.2423GPa, individually. It indicates that the strength of 
nanocomposite is less sensitive to system temperature. 
5. Conclusions   
In this work, the MD simulation was used to investigate the effects of SWNTs with different 
chiral angle on the strengthening phenomena of nanocomposite based on the Young’s modulus and 
interfacial energy results. In addition, influences of system temperature range were also discussed. 
The conclusions were the following: to start with, the nanocomposite was strengthened with 
different SWNT. Then, proof the interfacial energy of nanocomposite was larger with different
