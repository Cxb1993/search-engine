motion is realized through no-sliding wheels, the problem associated with 
nonholonomic constraints naturally arise. Based on Jourdain’s variational equation, it is 
possible to formulate the dynamics of such system in terms of the privileged coordinates.  
Given the desired trajectory, the corresponding reduced Appell’s equation can be used to 
design the control law for the privileged coordinates. On the other hand, to track the 
non-privileged coordinates, the conditions of constraints are re-structured from which 
the compensations for the desired values of privileged coordinates are computed. From 
the simulation results, it is shown that such hierarchical tracking control strategy which 
simultaneously takes kinematics and dynamics into consideration indeed gives rise to an 
effective algorithm for tracking problem. 
Next, we start from the Principle of Virtual Power to study the thermo-mechanical 
problems of viscous fluid with heat-conduction and the constitutive relation of 
micro-polar material. In dealing with the thermo-mechanical problem of viscous fluid 
with heat-conduction, we conventionally separated the variables from the mechanics 
and thermodynamics for analyzing. With the help of the Principle, the two different 
variables, velocity and velocity gradient from mechanics and temperature and entropy 
from thermodynamics, can be integrated. By selecting appropriate internal energy 
function and dissipative function, we could derive the equations of motion to assure the 
applicability of the Principle of Virtual Power on the thermo-mechanical problems of 
viscous fluid with heat-conduction. Moreover, in the aspect of micro-polar material, the 
Principle is also able to be applied to derive the constitutive relations. We assume the 
micro-polar acts like a rigid body for deriving the constitutive law. The detail is 
described in section 5. Besides, we also use the Reduced Appell Equation to investigate 
the tracking control problem and to construct equations of motion of the privileged 
coordinates. We adopt the backstepping method applied to the chained form of the 
kinematic equation to compute the compensated values for the privileged variables. 
Simulation results on the tracking control of wheeled vehicle show that the performance 
is excellent. 
Finally, we used the Principle to investigate the pseudo-rigid motion coined by 
Cohen [21] in the third year. In short, a pseudo-rigid body is a deformable body with 
spatial homogeneity of the deformation throughout, which can be viewed as a 
continuum subject to a set of kinematic constraints. The variational approach adopted 
here is based on the Principle of Virtual Power proposed by [2]. To apply the Principle 
in analyzing the characteristics of pseudo-rigid motions, we simply impose the 
kinematic conditions on the body and derive the compatibility conditions on the virtual 
velocities. The material property of the body is introduced through the internal energy 
and dissipation functions. With the internal structure and the compatibility conditions, 
the variational equation for a pseudo-rigid body is established from the variational 
equation of virtual power for a continuum. If there are no further constraints, the 
equations of motion can then be derived. It is neither necessary to apply the 
complementary Principle of Balance of Moment of Momentum as used in [21], nor to 
adopt the axiomatic definition proposed in [22]. To explore the internal stress structure, 
the variational equation for a continuum can be used to find the constraint body force 
and the constraint stress by using the method of Lagrange-multipliers. The variational 
approach thus provides a consistent framework for various theories. 
  
From this law, the equation of continuity ρ˙ + ρ∇ · v =0 can be derived.

linear momentum is

where fB denotes the body force per unit mass, and t(n) the surface force per unit
area acting on dA with unit outer normal vector n. Euler postulates the additional
principle of angular momentum expressed as
d

∫
B
r× r˙dm =

(6) Euler’s Equation for a Rigid Body — A body is said to be rigid if the
distance between each and every pair of particles or mass elements remain constant.
For a rigid body, the two Eulerian equations of motion are
mr¨c = F, Ic·ω˙ − ω × Ic·ω= LC , (2.7)
where m =

of angular momentum, Ic is the moment of inertia of the body rotating with the
angular velocity ω.
(7) The Cauchy Equations for Deformable Continuum — Cauchy intro-
duced the stress tensor σ in the Principle of Stress,
t(n) = n·σ. (2.8)
He then applied the divergence theorem to the surface integral in eqs. (2.5), (2.6)
to derive the local linear and angular momentum equations for a mass element ρdV,
ρv˙=ρfB +∇·σ, (Cauchy 1st eq.) (2.9)
σ = σT , (Cauchy 2nd eq., σij = σji) (2.10)
where v ≡ r˙ and it is given approximately by ∂u/∂t in linear theory of deformation
with displacement u.
(8) Constitutive Equations — The constitutive equations for material bodies
are originally established from observations. The equation for elastic solids was
based on Hooke’s law and extended by Cauchy to the following anisotropic form
σ = C : ε = C : ∇u, (elastic solid) (2.11)
where ε is the strain of the body approximated by (∇u + u∇)/2 in linear theory
of elasticity, and C is a fourth ranked tensor of material constants. For viscous
fluids, the equation was based on Newton’s law of viscous flow, and extended to the
following anisotropic form by Stokes:
σd = C′ : D = C : ∇v; (viscous fluid) (2.12)
where σd is the dissipative part of σ, D = (∇v + v∇)/2 is the stretching tensor of a
continuum, and C′ is another tensor of material constants. Substituting the previous

3. Principle of Virtual Power
In our formulation of variational principle of thermomechanics, we retain the
conservation law of mass (2.4), the first law of thermodynamics (2.13), and the
modified second law by adding the internal dissipation of energy R to equation
(2.18). The inequality of entropy is then modified to an equality in the following
form:
∫
V
ρS˙dV =
∫
V

)dV +
∫
V
R

dV, (3.1)
where
R ≡
∫
V
RdV ≥ 0. (3.2)
The combination of the equality and the inequality in the previous two equations
replaces the second law of thermodynamics.
Substituting the expression of (ρqb −∇ · q) from eq. (3.1) in local form into the
integrand of Eq.(2.13), we obtain
W +Q′ = U˙ +R, R ≥ 0 (3.3)
where Q′ is called the net applied heating given by
Q′ =
∫
V
ρθS˙dV −
∫
V
∇θ
θ
· qdV. (3.4)
This is called the modified second law of thermodynamics in this paper.
On the basis of the modified second law which defines the upper bound for heat-
ing conversion and energy dissipation in a thermomechanical process, we introduce
a basic principle of thermomechanics, the Principle of Virtual Power, as follows:
In all thermo-mechanical processes, the sum-total of virtual power by
the net forces and that by the net heating is balanced by the virtual
change of internal power of the material body for all virtual changes of
time-rate state variables compatible with constraints on the body.
This Principle can be expressed mathematically by the variational equation

∫

θ
∇θ · δ1q)dV
= δ1U˙ + δ1R
′, (3.5)
where R′, which is called the dissipation function of the body, is different from R
in general. The virtual change of the velocity and other rate variables in thermo
kinetics are denoted by the symbol δ1v with the understanding δ1r =δ1t = 0 as
first introduced by Jourdain [7]. The δ1 variation operates only on rate variables of
mechanics and thermokinetics such as the v, ∇v, S˙, q.
The constraints mentioned in the Principle include the traditional condition of
geometric constraints and that of kinematic constraints. The constraint on the
velocity and displacement of a rigid body are regarded as one of the constitutive

4.1 Part I
(1) Dynamics of Particles
For a discrete system of particles, we omit all the considerations of heat flow
(δ1Q
′ = 0) and set δ1U˙ and δ1R
′ to be zero. The variational equation (3.5) is re-
duced to the Jourdain variational equation of particles in Eq. (2.3). Based on this
reduced form, we can recover all dynamical equations of particles, such as Lagrange’s
equation, Appell’s equation, Gibbs-Appell equation, and so on [1]. In addition, we
can derive the equations of motion for systems with nonlinear kinematical con-
straints. Details will be reported by Li-Sheng Wang in this workshop along with a
comparison of differential variational principles and integral variational principles.
The former was based upon the point variations and the latter on the path variation
of physical variables describing the motion of the system.
(2) Dynamics of Rigid Bodies with Heat Conduction
For a heat-conducting material body, we convert the internal energy density U to
the free energy density F in the variational equation by the definition U ≡ F + θS.
The variational equation (3.5) is then converted to
∫
B
δ1v·(dF− r¨dm) +
∫

(−ρSδ1θ˙ −
1
θ
∇θ · δ1q)dV
=
∫
V
(ρδ1F˙ + δ1R
′)dV. (4.1.1)
Applying the condition of kinematic constraints on a rigid body, r˙ = r˙c +ω×(r−rc)
and assuming that F is a function of θ only and R′ is a function of θ and q only, we
reduce the previous variational equation into a simple form of variational equation
in δ1v
c, δ1ω, δ1θ˙, and δ1q. From the first two variations, we recover the Euler’s
equations of motion for a rigid body, Eq. (2.7), and from the last two we recover
the Fourier equation of heat conduction
q = −κ∇θ, (4.1.2)
where κ denotes the coefficient of heat conduction as a constitutive equation. In
addition, if we assume that F is a function of θ, q, we can recover the Maxwell-
Catteneo equation which gives rise to the wave equation for the temperature θ in
heat conduction [20]. Details will be given by Kuo-Ching Chen in another report of
this workshop.
(3) Dynamics of Thermoelastic Solids
For a deformable material body, we first applied the variational equation (3.5)
with dF =ρfBdV + t(n)dA to a cubic element bounded by six rectangular planes
∆AJ , with unit outer normal nJ , J = 1, ..., 6. and found that the relation between
the stress vector t(n) and the stress tensor as in the Cauchy stress principle. We then
obtain another variational equation involving five virtual variables, δ1v, δ1D, δ1Ω =
δ1(∇v − v∇)/2, δ1θ˙, and δ1q. By assuming that F is a function of θ, ε,and R
′
a function of θ ,q , we can recover the Cauchy’s first equation (2.9) and second

constraints. The hierarchical tracking control algorithm proposed in this paper suits such 
need. 
The practical problem to be solved in this paper is the tracking of a desired 
trajectory for a three-wheeled mobile robot, cf. [24], whose configuration is depicted in 
Figure 4.1, moving on a horizontal plane. The system may be modeled by a rigid body 
interconnected with two rolling-without-sliding wheels, cf. Figure 4.2. The castor wheel 
is ignored due to its negligible effects on the dynamics of the system. The motion of the 
wheels may be described by (xj, yj, ,j jψ θ ), 1,2j = , where (xj, yj) denote the coordinates of 
the center of mass and ,j jψ θ  are the rotation angle and the orientation angle of the 
wheels, respectively. The body may be characterized by (x3, y3, 3θ ), where 3θ  denotes 
the heading angle of the vehicle. There are total of 11 variables which are subject to five 
holonomic constraints: (4.2.1) 1 2θ θ θ= ≡ , (4.2.2) 2 3θ θ θ= ≡ , (4.2.3) 3 1 cos siny y b dθ θ= − + , 
(4.2.4) 3 1 sin cosx x b dθ θ= + + , (4.2.5) 2 1 2r r bϕ ϕ θ= + && & ; and four nonholonomic constraints: 
(4.2.6) 1 1 cosx rϕ θ= && , (4.2.7) 1 1 siny rϕ θ= && , (4.2.8) 2 2 cosx rϕ θ= && , (4.2.9) 2 2 siny rϕ θ= && . It is 
assumed further that the two wheels are rotated by motors which generate torques 1 2,τ τ , 
respectively. The objective of the design is to obtain a controller which enables the 
system to track a reference trajectory (xjr(t), yjr(t), 3 3 3( ), ( ), 1,2, ( ), ( ), ( )jr jr r r rt t j x t y t tψ θ θ= ) 
which satisfies the above-mentioned geometric and kinematic constraints.  
(3) The Methodology 
Based on Jourdain’s variational equation and Appell’s approach, cf. [1], one may 
choose 1,ψ θ as privileged coordinates, and derive the reduced Appell’s equations of 
motion as follows:

where , , 'c wm m m  denotes the masses of the components of the system. It is noted that 
these two equations are decoupled from the non-privileged coordinates, and the 
controller can be designed independently to track ( 1( ), ( )t tψ θ ). Various methods can be 
applied to obtain such a controller. Here, the adaptive sliding mode controller is adopted 
due to its capability of dealing with parameter uncertainties.  
While the privileged coordinates can be drived to the desired values without too 
much effort, the non-privileged coordinates may deviate from the reference values 
significantly if the initial conditions are not set appropriately or there are some 
disturbances during the motion. To solve this problem, it is noted from the practical 
experience of driving that we may change the reference values of the privileged 
coordinates to steer the non-privileged coordinates. The compensated values for the 
privileged coordinates may be computed from the kinematic equations:(4.2.6-7), 
(4.2.8) 2 1 cos 2 cosx r bϕ θ θ θ= + &&& , (4.2.9) 2 1 sin 2 siny r bϕ θ θ θ= + &&& , and those for the reference

invoked to track the new reference, which in turn drives the non-privileged coordinates 
5. Accomplishments in Year 2
5.1 Part I
(1) Equation of Motion of Viscous Fluid
With the first three sections, now we can discuss the application of Principle of Vir-
tual Power on viscous fluid with heat-conduction. It is easier to measure temperature
than entropy, so here we replace the internal energy U with the free energy F = U−θS.
According to F˙ = U˙ − θS˙ − Sθ˙, the variational Eq.(3.5) can be rewritten as:
∫
V
(ρfB +∇ · σ − ρr¨) · δ1vdV
+
∫

θ
∇θ · δ1q)dV
=
∫
V
(ρδ1F˙ + δ1R
W )dV. (5.1.1)
When discussing a system function, we must consider the Principle of Frame Indiffer-
ence, that is, if the system is in translational or rotational motion , the density of the
internal energy function U and the internal dissipation function RW should remain the
same. In other words, U and RW are irrelevant to δ1v and δ1ω. Therefore, we assume
that the free energy is the function of specific volume v(= 1/ρ) and temperature, and
the internal dissipation is the function of stretching tensor, temperature, and heat flux,
and it is given by
F = Fˆ (v, θ), RW = RˆW (D, θ,q). (5.1.2)
Hence, we can obtain the δ1 variation of F˙ and R
W as
δ1F˙ =

In the above equation, the five virtual variables δ1v, δ1ω, δ1D, δ1θ˙ and δ1q are all
independent from each other, thus we have

while c is critical viscosity, Γ is the matrix of thermal resistance coefficient. By the

These are the constitutive equations of thermal field. Eq. (5.1.19) represents the re-
lationship between entropy and temperature derived by free energy, and the latter
represents heat flux and temperature derived by the function of internal energy dis-
sipation. Let κ = Γ−1 be the heat conductivity coefficient, and we obtain Fourier
Law:
q = −κ∇θ. (5.1.21)
In the new theory of thermodynamics, Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics (EIT)
[47], a general function of free energy density is a function of specific volume and
temperature. Moreover, heat flux is added to be a variable in the function, which is
represented by
F = Fˆ (v, θ,q), (5.1.22)
therefore, the following equation is obtained:
δ1F˙ = δ1(
∂Fˆ
∂v
v˙ +
∂Fˆ
∂θ

Subsequently, we further assume that F can be reduced to an independent function
relative to v, θ and q:
Fˆ = Fˆ1(v) + Fˆ2(θ) + Fˆ3(q), (5.1.24)
and we will have
δ1F˙ =

q, (5.1.25)
with
Gq ≡

∂q
= Gq(q). (5.1.26)
Let Gq be the linear function of q:
Gq ≡ Λqq, (5.1.27)
when the function of internal energy dissipation and free energy are variational, they
both have the variable δ1q˙, therefore we obtain the following equation according to
Eq. (5.1.20) and (5.1.25):
τ q˙ + q = −κ∇θ, (5.1.28)
with the relaxation time τ = ρκΛqθ. Eq. (5.1.28) is the Maxell-Cattaneo Equation,
which represents general relationships between temperature and heat flux.
(3) Constitutive Law of Micro-polar continuity
Micropolar continuity is a kind of material with microrotational and rotational
inertia. It sustains couple-stresses and distributed bending moment. The force that
can work includes four parts: the external force F per unit mass, bending moment I
per unit mass, stress t, and couple-stresses c. On the other hand, the kinetic energy

Assume that free energy is the function of specific volume v, temperature θ and K =

∇∇× u , that is,
F = Fˆ (v,K, θ).
Also, assume the dissipation function is the function of heat flux q,
RW

= RˆW (q).
Then the δ1 variation of R
W ′ is,
δ1F˙ =

5.2 Part II
(1) Introduction
Rolling wheels are frequently installed to enhance the mobility of a robot such that
the working space can be enlarged significantly. However, due to the appearance of
the nonholonomic constraints, the motion planning and the tracking control of wheeled
mobile robots are difficult to be managed. In the phase of motion planning [26, 27], a
suitable trajectory is designed to connect the initial posture (i.e. the position and the
orientation of the robot) and the final one such that no collisions with obstacles would
occur and the kinematic constraints are satisfied. Once the optimal path is obtained,
the navigation and control process enters the tracking phase in which the kinematics
as well as the dynamical equations must be considered. To appropriately integrate
the kinematics and the dynamics such that every path can be followed efficiently and
globally is the main subject of this paper.
Among various schemes in performing nonholonomic motion planning and stabiliza-
tion, the transformation of the kinematic equations to chained form or skew-symmetric
chained form attracts the interests of many researchers [28, 29] due to their simple struc-
tures. Based on the chained form, time-varying feedback [30], discontinuous feedback
[31], and hybrid strategy [32] can be applied to circumvent the under-actuated problem.
In particular, the idea of backstepping [33, 34] can be adopted to systematically design
recursive algorithms for the stabilization of a multi-input chained system such as a fire
truck [35], the tracking of a two-input chained system such as an articulated vehicle
[5], or the tracking with saturation constraint for a class of unicycle mobile robot [36].

(2) Problem Description  
The practical problem to be attacked in this paper is the tracking of a desired trajectory 
for a four-wheeled mobile robot, as shown in Fig. 5.1, moving on a horizontal plane. The 
system may be modeled by a platform with mass mc, width w, length l, and height hc, 
attached by four rolling-without-sliding wheels with equal masses mw and radius a. To 
simplify the analysis, we assume that the two wheels on each axle (front or rear) can be 
treated as a single wheel centered at the midpoint of the axle (Qf or Qr , respectively), cf. 
Fig. 5.2. The approximated model is the so-called car-like mobile robot, which consists of a 
platform (body c), a front wheel (body f) and a rear wheel (body r). The masses of the rim 
of each wheel and platform are denoted by 
w
m′  and cm′ , respectively. Let fρ , rρ  be the 
distance between the point Qf , Qr and the mass center of platform C, respectively. The 
contacts between the wheels and the ground are assumed to be pure rolling without 
slipping. 
The translational motion of body i (i = c, f, r) may be described by the position of its mass 
center, which is expressed with respect to the inertial frame { , , }x y zE E E  as  
.
C x y z
i i i ix y z= + +r E E E           (5.2.1) 
To describe the rotational motion, the type (3-1-2) Eulerian angles are used to rotate the 
inertial frame { ,  ,  }x y zE E E  to ' ' '{ ,  ,  }zi i i =i j k E  by the heading angle iθ , and then to 
" ' " "{ ,  ,  }i i i i=i i j k  by the camber angle iψ , and finally to the pre-specified body frame 
"{ ,  ,  }x y zi i i i=e e j e  of body i by the spin angle iϕ . If the rotation is time-varying, the rates of

The six variables ( ), , , , ,i i i i i ix y z ψ ϕ θ  are adopted here to describe the configuration 
of body i, and therefore there are eighteen variables to be specified for the system. However, 
due to physical constraints, the number required may be reduced. By the assumption that 
the motion is horizontal, we have (i)

Various control schemes can be used to fulfill the objective of steering the privileged 
variables with (17). To deal with uncertainties on the parameters of the system, one may 
apply the idea of adaptive control for which some intrinsic properties of the reduced Appell 
equations is essential. For the dynamic systems, the following lemmas can be established. 
Lemma 1: M(y) is an m×m positive-definite symmetric matrix. 
Lemma 2. ( ) 2 ( , )−M y C y y& &  is skew-symmetric.    
If all the system parameters such as masses, moments of inertia, and physical 
specifications of the mobile robot, etc, are known, we may use traditional methods to steer 
the privileged coordinates. However, in many cases, some parameters are unknown or 
uncertain, which may form an uncertain parameter vector pR∈
Θ
. By appropriate 
re-arrangement, we may express the left-hand side of (5.2.4) in the following linear 
parametric form

where ( ) m pR ×⋅ ∈Y  is termed the regressor matrix, whose elements consist of known 
functions of y , y& , and y&& . This form shall be used later to design the adaptive control 
law in the dynamic level. In particular, by choosing the unknown vector of parameters as

It is noted that z does not appear in (5.2.4), and hence the system of mobile robot is 
reducible so that the idea of the hierarchical control proposed in this paper is applicable. 
(4) Hierarchical Tracking Controller Design 
As described in the previous section, the dynamics of a reducible mechanical system 
may be separated into two parts: the reduced Appell equation and the corresponding 
kinematic equation relating the privileged velocities and the non-privileged ones. Since the 
reduced equations are decoupled from the kinematic equations, a controller may be 
designed to steer y to the desired yd(t) independently. However, if the initial condition is not 
perfect or there are some disturbances during the motion, the desired non-privileged 
variables zd(t) cannot be tracked. It is then necessary to invoke the kinematic relation to 
fulfill the control objective. To accommodate the constraints and take the advantage of the 
decoupling property of the mobile robot system, the idea of hierarchical tracking controller 
with three levels was proposed in [43]. The specific structure with the backstepping 
controller in the kinematic level for the car-like robot is described below, with details given

It is seen that if ( ) 0

corresponds to the posture of the vehicle that ( ) ( 2) ,  ( 0, 1, )d at k kθ pi pi= + ∈ ± L . As a 
result, around 2dθ pi= ± , the tracking of the chain form (5.2.11) with the transformation 
(5.2.10) is not feasible. To overcome the above problem, we construct another set of 
coordinate transformation ( )= Ξξ x  and input transformation ( )=u Ψ x v  by using the 
same procedures described before, as

It is then observed that singularity occurs when 0
rdy =& , which corresponds to 0,dθ pi= ± . 
Thus, the set of equations (5.2.11) is complementary to that of (5.2.14), which shall be used 
interchangeably according to the following switching mechanism.  
B. Switching Mechanism 
To avoid the singularity arising in the tracking process, we adopt two sets of 
complementary chained form systems to design the backstepping controller. From the 
above discussion, If θ  is closed to ( 0, 1)k kpi = ± , it is desirable to adopt the ξ  
subsystem to design the kinematic compensator ( )c tu . On the other hand, if θ  is closed 
to ( 2)pi± , then one should change the chained form to the one with ξ . Depending on the 
heading angle θ  of the mobile robot, a mechanism is designed to perform the switching, 
which is divided into two phases. As θ  increases, cf. Figure 5.3(a), the switch from 
  
 24 
be steered to the desired value asymptotically.

(5) Continuation Method in Kinematic Compensator Design  
After the state equation being transformed into the chained forms, the technique of 
backstepping can be applied to design an effective controller. While the method discussed 
in [30] may be adopted, a new algorithm is developed here to efficiently generate the 
controller.

Recall that in the above analysis, the asymptotic stability is guaranteed if 1 20,  0.k k> >  
Therefore, we may adjust the control parameters in the positive region to make 
c
u  
continuous during switching. If F or F  becomes singular, which means that 3χ  or 4∆  
is zero, both (5.2.23) and (5.2.24) lead to the original desired value of u , and the value of 
K or K  becomes immaterial. We simply set *=K K  or *=K K . On the other hand, if 
the slack variables iχ  are away from zero, both F and F  are nonsingular. We may try to 
find the appropriate control parameters such that the difference between (5.2.23) and 
(5.2.24) is minimized. Nevertheless, the performance of the controller may be sacrificed, 
and a mechanism must be used after switching to drive the control parameters to their 
designed value *k ’s. Detailed process for switching from ξ -system to ξ -system consists 
of the following two steps. 
Step 1: Given K , find the control parameters 0K .

(7) Simulation Results 
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed global backstepping tracking control 
methodology, computer simulations for a car-like mobile robot were performed. The system 
parameters of a large vehicle shown in Fig. 5.1 were selected as a = 0.3m, rρ = 0.5m, fρ = 
0.75m, l  = 1.75m, w = 1.5m, mc = 20kg, 6 , 1 , 2c w wm kg m kg m kg′ ′= = = . The desired 
trajectory (xrd(t), yrd(t)) is obtained by finding a cubic B-spline function (cf. [45]) passing

where ∇v is the spatial velocity gradient tensor. Hence, for a continuum, we have
the following constraint,
L = ∇v. (6.1.8)
Furthermore, we have
F¨ = (L˙+ L2) · F. (6.1.9)
The velocity and the acceleration of the material point in a pseudo-rigid body are
then given respectively by
x˙ = v = x˙c + L · s, (6.1.10)
x¨ = x¨c + (L˙+ L2) · s, (6.1.11)
where s = x − xc = F · S. While for a pseudo-rigid body the constraint condi-
tion (6.1.8) can be derived from (6.1.10), they are independent by treating the body
as a general continuum.
(2) Variational Equation for a Pseudo-Rigid Body in Motion
The Principle of Virtual Power and the associated variational equation (3.5)
described in Section 3 is now applied to derive the variational equation for the
dynamics of a material body subject to the (internal) kinematic constraint (6.1.10).
The compatibility condition on the virtual velocity can be obtained from (6.1.10) as
δ1v = δ1x˙
c + δ1L · s. (6.1.12)
Substituting this relation and the acceleration equation (6.1.11) into the left-hand
side of Eq. (3.5), the virtual net-working δ1WA is expressible as
δ1WA =

By selecting appropriate forms of Uˆ and RˆW with material parameters, equations
(6.1.20), (6.1.21), and (6.1.26) (a total of 12 equations) comprise a complete set of
ordinary differential equations for the 12 unknowns xc and F. They can be used to
study the motion of a pseudo-rigid body.
Eqs. (6.1.21) and (6.1.26) can be combined to yield the following tensor equation,

Without the dissipation term, this equation corresponds to that derived by Cohen
and Muncuster [25], with differences in the term including the internal energy which
is replaced by Σ, identified as Σ =
∫
V
σdV . However, by Cauchy’s stress principle,
the traction t(n) imposed on the exterior surface of the body is related to the stress
tensor σ according to t(n) = n · σ. It follows that the externally specified force
is related to the material property through Σ, which leads to an inconsistency. It
shall be shown in Section 6.2 that the discrepancy occurs due to the existence of a
constraint stress. As a result, in the following development, the traction is specified
by the problem at hand, which is not directly related to the internal energy U .
6.2 Consistency with Other Theories
Based on the Principle of Virtual Power, we have derived the variational equation
for a pseudo-rigid body by incorporating the compatibility conditions directly. If no
further constraints exist, the variations on rate variables in Eq. (6.1.19) are arbitrary
and the equations of motion for a pseudo-rigid body can be obtained. However,
if further constraints exist such that the virtual rate variables are restricted by
the associated compatibility conditions, the equations of motion for a constrained
pseudo-rigid body may not be in the form given by (6.1.20), (6.1.27). Either direct
substitution of the compatibility condition or use of a Lagrange multiplier may be
applied to deal with this situation.
Consider in particular, a special type of pseudo-rigid motion, namely the rigid
body motion. The additional constraint is
D = sym(L) = 0. (6.2.1)
By directly substituting the compatibility condition,
δ1D = 0, (6.2.2)
34
One may interpret Υ as the constraint stress in the pseudo-rigid body to ensure
rigidity. Upon the inclusion of the constraint stress, Eq. (6.1.27) becomes valid for
rigid body motions. However, the additional unknowns in Υ make the problem
harder to solve. One would rather use the impressed moment tensor in (6.2.12),
which leads to the Euler equation, to find the motion, and apply (6.2.13) to compute
the constraint stress.
On the other hand, a pseudo-rigid body can be regarded as a constrained con-
tinuum. In sections 6.1, the compatibility condition δ1v = δ1x˙
c + δ1L · s for a
pseudo-rigid body was substituted for δ1v in the developed variational equation for
a continuum. Since for a pseudo-rigid motion the constraint condition is spatially
homogeneous, the global form of the variational equation could be derived. To ob-
tain the internal structure (the constraint forces and stresses) against the external
load to maintain the pseudo-rigidity, we could use Lagrangian multipliers in (3.5) to
free the variations from the pseudo-rigid motion, and then derive the corresponding
equations of motion and constitutive equations. In particular, with respect to the
kinematic constraints (6.1.8) and (6.1.10), the compatibility conditions on δ1v and
δ1∇v are, respectively, given by
δ1v = δ1x˙
c + δ1L · s, (6.2.14)
δ1∇v = δ1L. (6.2.15)
Let λ and Λ be the associated Lagrange multipliers, which may be interpreted as a
constraint force density and constraint stress, respectively. The variational equation
of a pseudo-rigid body is then derived from (3.5) as∫
V
(ρ(b− x¨) +∇ · σ) · δ1vdV +

Λ : (δ1∇v − δ1L)dV, (6.2.16)
With the inclusion of the Lagrange multipliers, the variations δ1v and δ1∇v are now
free. Under the assumption that U = Uˆ(E) and RW = RˆW (D), the virtual internal
power in (6.2.16) can be expressed as
δ1U˙ = (F · ∂Uˆ(E)

since F · ∂Uˆ(E)

are symmetric. Substituting (6.2.17)–(6.2.18) into
(6.2.16), the variational equation may be expressed as∫

6. Conclusion
As another attempt to unify principles of mechanics and laws of thermodynam-
ics, a principle of virtual power with the associated variation equation has been
introduced. In conjunction with the two basic laws, the balance of mass and that of
energy-entropy, we have derived the classical balance equations of linear and angu-
lar momentum for continuum from the variational equation. In addition, we have
established by applying the same principle the variational constitutive equations for
materials, elastic or dissipative, and that of heat conduction (such as the Fourier
law) in a continuum. Such an addition is made possible by treating the internal
energy U and the dissipation function RW as unknown system functions, and by
invoking the relaxation process on the variations of pertinent rate variables of the
thermo-mechanical system.
With the approach of Principle of Virtual Power, we can easily derive the equa-
tions of motion and the constitutive relation in one variational equation of the
micropolar continuum. There are six indepent virtual rate variables: δ1v, δ1ω, δ1D,
δ1(∇ω), δ1s˙, and δ1q in the variational equation. Since the first two variable δ1v
and δ1ω are indepent of the internal energy U˙ and the dissipation function R′, we
can obtain the balance equations of linear and angular momentum. Next, we choose
the appropriated variables ν, K,and θ of the free energy function and get the rela-
tionships between the free energy and the stress tensor, the stress couple tensor and
the specific entropy. We assume the dissipation function has only one parameter,
the heat flux q, for the micropolar elasticity and obtain the relation between the
dissipation function and the temperature. That can be derived to the Fourier law,
q =− κ∇θ, the constitutive law of thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a global tracking controller was designed for a car-like mobile robot
after its model being established based on the reduced Appell equation, which is
decoupled from the kinematics for the tacitly selected privileged variables. The ad-
vantage of the decoupling feature was taken in the hierarchical design in which the
control scheme is separated into the kinematic compensator and the dynamic con-
troller. The updated reference values for the privileged variables were obtained from
the compensator were fed into a sliding mode controller for the reduced dynamics
to steer the privileged variables and all the other variables shall follow suit due to
the nature of the system. This concept is quite different from that of the two-stage
controllers discussed in [30, 31, 32] such that it is possible to run the controller and
the compensator at different sampling rates in our design. Our design scheme may
be even more beneficial in dealing with more complicated systems. A mobile robot
in fact consists of many components interacting with each other and the Lagrangian
formulation may not be tractable. The formulation of Appell’s equation is much
more transparent and leads to a suitable structure for controller design as shown in
this paper.
In the development of the kinematic compensator, the state equation was first
transformed into chained forms such that the structure becomes simpler and the
idea of backstepping can be applied directly. To deal with the singularity problem
arising from the transformations, a switching mechanism based on the posture of the
robot was proposed. A continuation algorithm was then invoked to yield continuous
changing of the desired privileged variables by adjusting the control parameters.
The performance of the controller is maintained by the approaching method such
