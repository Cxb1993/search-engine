II.2 6BApproach 
We devised a resilient application layer multicasting (ALM) mechanism, which has several desirable 
properties. (1) Peers can tolerate a small number of packet delay or loss and they still can receive 
complete message in time. (2) A sudden breakdown of some peers or links won’t disrupt the 
reception of downstream peers. (3) Streaming data can be retrieved only by the peers subscribing to 
the ALM service, but not by the peers helping to provide the service. 
 
Figure 1 : Application Layer Multicast (ALM) System 
We solve the asymmetric connectivity issue by making full use of peers’ upstream bandwidth and 
increasing the total upstream bandwidth of the service. To reach the purpose we described, we use 
three approaches, which are described in the following paragraphs. 
(A) 19BInformation Dispersion 
Rabin’s Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) is used to process the message generated from 
source peer and a message will be divided into several stripes. The peers can’t know any content 
without receiving sufficient number of stripes. There are two meanings. First, it means you can’t 
know any content of the message from one or few stripes. Therefore, if some peers have no authority 
to read the message, we only need to make sure not to let them receive too many different stripes of 
the message. Second, it means peers don’t need to receive whole stripes of a message and they can 
still know the complete message. By this characteristic, we can improve the fault tolerance and 
robustness of data transmission. 
(B) 20BMultiple Path Transport 
Each message transported from source peer that provide streaming data will be divided into several 
stripes. In the multicasting tree formation, we not only construct one tree, we construct as many 
different trees as the number of stripes that one message is divided into. And each tree transmits 
different stripe of the message. This approach will lead to two advantages. First, each stripe will pass 
through different path. When one peer leaves or crashed, descendants of the peer will only lose one 
stripes and they still can receive other stripes. Furthermore, when a hop of the path is congested, it 
only influences on the reception of one stripe. Second, a stripe is much smaller than a message. The 
advantage is that a peer with low upstream bandwidth can also support several children because the 
data it needs to retransmit is small enough. Therefore, every peer can fully utilize their upstream 
bandwidth. 
(C) 21BHelper Recruitment 
Because the lack of upstream bandwidth, even we use multiple stripes approach to fully utilize every 
peer’s upstream bandwidth; it is still possible that new peers cannot find the parent in the tree that 
can provide them smooth streaming data. Therefore, the service will request some peers called helper 
that still have unnecessary bandwidth to join and share their bandwidth to increase the total upstream

The retransmission is controlled by receiver. When receiver wants to receive a multimedia data 
unit, receiver will send a request message to sender ask for the data unit. If in next time slot, 
receiver dose not receive the data unit, receiver will decide whether resend a request message to 
sender or not depends on the transmission policy.   
 Receiver-driven Aggressive Retransmission 
The different with Receiver-driven Retransmission is that sender will send the data unit 
continuously until receiver sends an ACK message which represents receiver received the data 
unit. 
 Rate-distortion Estimation 
Expected Distortion Value 
𝐷(𝐿,𝑇)(𝝅) = 𝐷0 − ∑ 𝛥𝐷(𝐿′,𝑇′) ∏ (1− 𝜖𝜋(𝐿′′,𝑇′′))
ℵ𝐺(𝐿′′,𝑇′′)≼ℵ𝐺(𝐿′,𝑇′)ℵ𝐺(𝐿′,𝑇′)∈𝑆(𝐿,𝑇)
+ 𝒞(𝐿,𝑇)  
Expected Transmission Cost Value 
𝑅(𝐿,𝑇)(𝝅) = ∑ (𝐵(𝐿′,𝑇′) + 𝐻 ⋅ 𝑁(𝐿′,𝑇′))
ℵ𝐺(𝐿′,𝑇′)∈𝑆(𝐿,𝑇)
𝜌𝜋(𝐿′,𝑇′)  
III.2 Transmission Policy Optimization 
 Optimization Algorithm 1 
We used Greedy algorithm to find next possible policies according to extraction path. And then 
compute the expected rate and distortion choose the optimal improvement from these policies as 
our next policy. Find out the next policy step by step. Finally, we can get the optimized policy. 
 Optimization Algorithm 2 
Algorithm 2 is also greedy but it did not take the extraction paths into account. When we tried to 
find the next policy, the algorithm will regard all possible policies as candidates even if some of 
them do not have any dependency with the data units that receiver has already received. Use this 
algorithm we find out another possible optimized solution.
