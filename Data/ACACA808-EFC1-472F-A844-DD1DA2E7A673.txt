Abstract 
In recent years, Service Oriented Architecture has become a popular issue in information technology. 
It attempts to solve the compatibility problem and shares services on the internet. The purpose of this 
study is to apply the concept of service oriented architecture (SOA) to design the news knowledge 
extraction and representation system. The main goal of this study focuses on converting legacy system 
to Web Service based on SOA. We create a light-weight and corpus-based Chinese Segmentation 
Service. We collected a total of 11,881 Chinese news reports that belong to politics category from 
March 1st to May 31rd in 2008 from Yahoo!Kimo as test data set. Finally, we compare the execution 
time of Chinese Corpus Segmentation (CCS) service with CKIP, and the execution time of CCS is 
faster than CKIP.

1. Introduction 
With the advent of internet, most people use internet to deliver and get information they need. It is a 
dramatic change for human habits and practices to acquire new information in current knowledge 
economy. Therefore, Electronic Newspapers is one of important way to disseminate information. Now, 
there are many people read Electronic Newspapers instead of newspapers. 
The rapid growth of information leads to the serious problem for Information Overload. Hundreds 
of news documents are generated every day, and increase the phenomenon of Information Overload. 
Over the few years, our previous studies [1-4] focus on solving problems of Information Overload on 
Chinese online news documents, and do well. However, with the evolution of legacy system, while we 
want to add a new function or a subsystem, we have to rewrite code again and again. Thus, we shift

2.2 Web services 
Web Services technique plays an important role in achieving the spirit of SOA. The W3C (World 
Wide Web Consortium) framework for Web Services consists of a foundation built on top of three 
core XML specifications[6].The three core XML specifications are SOAP[7] (Simple Object Access 
Protocol), WSDL[8] (Web Services Description Language) and UDDI[9] (Universal Discovery 
Description and Integration). However, Microsoft, IBM and SAP shutdown the public UDDI Business 
Registry[10].  
In 2000, the UDDI Business Registry (UBR) was provided by Microsoft, IBM and SAP. The primary goal of the UBR is 
to prove the interoperability and robustness of the UDDI specifications through a public implementation. And now they 
achieve the target. Because of the success of UBR, UDDI specifications become the standards of OASIS. Now some 
software suppliers include UDDI into their software products as a key characteristic. That is the reason why Microsoft, 
IBM and SAP shutdown the public UDDI Business Registry. In this study, we use Seekda which is Web Services portal as 
our service registry. Then we publish the WSDL to Seekda.Service provider publishes their WSDL to the service 
registry. Service consumer search services in a service registry. In this study, we publish the WSDL to 
Seekda which is Web Services portal. It allows user to find service they need through UDDI. 
Web Services is one of standard to realize the concept of SOA. This study uses Apache Tomcat and 
Apache Axis 2 as the implement platform because their update speed is the fastest and corresponds 
with the specifications of W3C. There are two implementations of the Apache Axis 2 Web services 
engine, including Apache Axis2/Java and Apache Axis2/C. Tomcat is not only a Servlet Container 
based on Java, but with the functions of Web Server.

Table 1 The description of six services 
Service Description 
CCS 
The CCS service is a Chinese term segmentation service. It segments news terms 
from news documents. 
NTE The NTE service collects news reports and stores news terms in database. 
TDT 
The TDT service clusters the news reports and news terms belong to the same 
event. 
TCS 
The TCS service provides the news reports in the form of Topic Story according 
to two aspects, event-oriented and people-oriented. 
NAN The NAN service builds a relational network for topic, event, and episode. 
KDM The KDM service provides the news reports in the form of knowledge maps. 
When we finish converting our existing system to services, we publish WSDL to Web Service portal. 
In this study, we use Seekda which is Web Services portal as our service registry. Then we publish the 
WSDL to Seekda. Users search services on Seekda. Users use our services through Seekda. Figure 2 
depicts the architecture of NKERS based on SOA.

4. System Implementation 
In this study, we divided our existing system into six services. There are six services in this system, 
and we take CCS Service as an example. CCS is a Chinese term segmentation service. It segments 
news terms from news documents. The majority of terms is extracted by Terms Extraction, and by 
applying the corpus database we would extract the unknown terms from the sentences. 
We publish the WSDL for CCS service to Seekda. WSDL describes the public interface to the web 
service, so CCS service can be easily employed by publishing this WSDL document. Figure  shows 
the part of WSDL for CCS service. Figure 5 depicts Web Service details: Segmentation is displayed on 
the Seekda. The methods provided by CCS service are shown as Figure 6.

When user invokes the CCS service, user has to choose the one binding. Figure 7 shows transport 
details. Users invoke this service is shown as Figure 8. Figure 9 depicts the result of segmentation.
