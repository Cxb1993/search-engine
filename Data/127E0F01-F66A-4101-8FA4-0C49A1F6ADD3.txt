Abstract 
The development of a microthruster based on 
gaseous pulsed detonation is presented in this 
study. The feasibility of cyclic valveless pulsed 
detonation at frequencies over 100 Hz is first 
experimentally investigated in a microchannel with 
1 mm × 0.6 mm rectangular cross-section. Highly 
reactive ethylene/oxygen mixtures are utilized to 
reduce time and distance required for the reaction 
wave to run up to detonation in a smooth channel. 
High speed visualizations have shown that the 
reaction waves reach detonative state through 
highly repeatable flame acceleration and 
deflagration-to-detonation transition processes in 
the channel. The validated concepts are 
implemented for the development of an integrated 
pulsed detonation microthruster. The volume of the 
reaction channel in the microthruster was 58 mm3. 
The pressure measurements showed that the 
reaction wave propagated at velocities larger than 
2000 m/s before reaching the channel exit. The 
impulse bit generated by the detonation pulse is on 
the order of 10Ns.

1. Introduction 
With the decreasing size and increasing 
functions of microsatellites, the development of 
micro propulsion units capable of providing small 
but precise thrust and impulse bits while 
consuming little power become imminent. In 
addition to the challenges in performance, the 
overall dimension and weight of the propulsion 
unit have to be compact enough for integrating into 
the microspacecraft. Chemical microthrusters are 
able to meet a relatively wide range of propulsion 
needs; the microthrusters are also advantageous 
from the power consumption perspective 
comparing to electrical microthrusters. In this 
paper, we present a new type of chemical 
microthruster based on pulsed detonation. These 
devices are generally called pulsed detonation 
engines (PDE) when applied to aerial vehicles or 
pulsed detonation thrusters (PDT) if the purpose is 
for space propulsion. The relatively simple 
structure of a PDT is advantageous for 
miniaturization. The feasibility of the device was 
validated by using a prototype microchannel 
assembly made of stainless-steel.  
Most chemical microthrusters rely on high-
pressure steady-state deflagrative combustion of 
liquid or gaseous propellants to generate power. 
Extra work has to be supplied for injecting the 
reactants into the high pressure combustion 
chamber. Detonation is a type of “pressure gain” 
3 
 
Highly reactive fuels are also preferred for 
microthruster. With pure oxygen as the oxidizer, 
quenching distance for reactive fuel such as 
ethylene and acetylene can be as small as a few 
hundreds micrometers. The quenching distance for 
hydrogen is also very small, but the condensation 
of the water vapor in the burned gas region may 
interrupt flame acceleration and DDT in 
millimeter-scale channel. So, Ethylene and oxygen 
are selected as fuel and oxidizer in the present 
study. 
2.2 Valveless pulse detonation 
Pulsed detonation engines can be operated with 
and without inlet valves. Proven microvalves that 
are able to repetitively sustain intermittent blaze of 
high temperature wave (> 1500 K) and pressure 
(>1 MPa) detonation waves.operate at frequencies 
at hundreds Hz are however not available. The 
valveless inlet design was therefore utilized for the 
present pulsed detonation microthrusters. The 
design is also relatively simple and easier to be 
miniaturized. The working principle of valveless 
designs is based on gas dynamics in the detonation 
tube. As the pressure in the detonation tube during 
the detonation transmission phase becomes larger 
than the pressure at the inlets of the reactants, the 
adverse pressure gradient works as a valve that 
blocks the fuel and oxygen supply. The pressure in 
the tube decreases as the burned gas being 
discharged from the tube. The reactant mixture 
begins to refill the tube when the tube pressure is 
lower than the inlet pressure.  
Brophy et al. [14, 15] developed a valveless 
PDT that was operated with both gaseous 
(methane, ethylene) and liquid (JP-10) fuels. The 
PDT generates detonation by direct initiation, and 
using a divergent tube to transmit the reaction 
wave into the combustion chamber. In their 
research using ethylene as the fuel [15], a semi-
valveless design, a valveless design for oxidizer 
inlet and a control valve at the fuel inlet, was 
applied to achieve more precise control of the fuel 
quantity. They also implemented absorption 
spectroscopy to monitor the detonation 
propagation. The size of combustion chamber is 
however relatively large; the tube was 10.16 cm in 
diameter and 58.5 cm in length. The maximum 
operation frequency was 55 Hz. Flow dynamics of 
the valveless operation were revealed by Ma et al. 
[16, 17] using numerical simulations. They 
concluded that maintaining suitable flow rates in 
the detonation tube as well as the initiator section 
are essential for successful valveless operation.  
3. Validation of micro pulse detonation 
3.1 The pulsed detonation channel assembly 
Fig. 1 conceptually shows the inlet and 
detonation channel configuration for validating the 
feasibility of a microthruster based on pulsed 
detonation using valveless inlets and DDT to 
initiate detonation wave. Oxidizer flows into the 
detonation channel from the back end of the 
detonation channel, while fuel is injected 
perpendicularly from the sides to avoid the 
formation of a stagnation plane between fuel and 
oxidizer. The configuration effectively prevents the 
stabilization of a non-premixed flame in the 
mixing section, which is 16.1 mm long between 
the channel intersection and the ignition point. The 
total length for reaction channel including the 
mixing section is 101.1 mm. So, transition to 
detonation should occur within 85 mm in the 
microchannel for pulsed detonation operation to be 
feasible. Locations of the pressure taps for 
measuring the dynamic pressure in the channel are 
also depicted in Fig. 1.

pulsed detonation microthruster. P1 to P4 are the 
locations of pressure taps on the wall of the 
channel. 
 
Fig. 2. Exploded view of the microchannel 
assembly for testing micro-scale pulsed detonation 
concepts. 
A stainless-steel assembly was fabricated to 
test pulsed detonation operation in the 
microchannel. Fig. 2 is the exploded view of the 
microchannel assembly, which consists of 4 major 
pieces. The detonation chamber and the inlet 
5 
 
sequences. The repeatability of the flame 
acceleration and DDT process are also found in Fig. 
4(b), which shows the velocity evolutions of the 
reaction wave along the channel. 
Figs. 4 also show that the flame accelerates 
rapidly after ignition, and transition to detonation 
occurred at ~ 40 mm downstream from the ignition 
spot. The propagation velocity of the reaction 
sharply increases during the transition. The 
luminosity of the reaction wave also abruptly 
intensifies. Terminal velocity of the reaction wave 
before leaving the channel was ~ 2000 m/s, which 
was close to Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocities for 
ethylene/oxygen mixtures. The velocity evolutions 
show that the reaction wave underwent DDT 
process in the microchannel, and the near C-J 
velocities characterized at the end of the channel 
verify that the reaction wave had reached 
detonation state before leaving the channel. The 
visualization also shows that the time for the 
deflagrative flame to evolve into detonation wave 
is ~ 110 s.  
It is also observed that the reaction wave 
propagates upstream in the mixing section initially 
after ignition. However, the reaction wave was 
quenched in the oxygen inlet section where there 
would be insufficient fuel for the reaction to be 
self-sustainable. The images also show that there is 
no stabilized diffusion flame at the cross 
intersection of fuel and oxidizer streams 
confirming that the inlet configuration can 
effectively eliminate the stabilization of a non-
premix flame in the mixing section that would 
interrupt the valveless pulsed detonation cycle. The 
cyclic detonation initiation through DDT also 
demonstrates that extra purging gas stream is 
unnecessary in the present design.

 Pulsed detonation operations at 100 Hz were 
carried out under a variety of upstream pressures. 
Table 1 shows the terminal velocities characterized 
using high-speed imaging under different ethylene 
and oxygen supply pressures. The terminal 
velocities were all beyond 1900 m/s, indicating 
that the reaction waves had reached detonation 
state. The highest terminal velocity is found for the 
case with ethylene and oxygen supply pressures at 
0.340 MPa (50 psig) and 0.204 MPa (30 psig), 
respectively. The supply pressure of ethylene is 
higher than the pressure of oxygen in this case, so 
the duration that the fuel is able to charge the 
chamber is longer than the oxidizer. The mixture 
stoichiometry is likely fuel rich. The terminal 
velocity is equivalent to C-J velocity of mixture 
with estimated equivalence ratio, Φest, equals to 1.1. 
Actual equivalence ratio of the mixture should be 
higher because velocity deficit exists for 
detonation wave propagating in small channels. 
The reduced detonation propagating velocities in 
small channels are due to the excessive momentum 
and heat losses. The losses can result in as much as 
15-20 % velocity reduction. 
It is also found in Table 1 that the terminal 
velocities are the same when equal pressures for 
the fuel and oxidizer at 0.272 MPa (40 psig) and 
0.340 MPa (50 psig) are supplied. Stoichiometry 
for the two cases is therefore identical. But the 
terminal detonation wave velocity with a lower 
supply pressure at 0.204 MPa (30 psig) is slightly 
slower although the pressure upstream of the 
orifices are the same for ethylene and oxygen. The 
difference may be an indication of insufficient 
flow rate to fully refill the channel under low 
supply pressure. The charging duration is too short 
to completely refill the volume. Lowest terminal 
velocity occurs when 0.204 MPa (30 psig) was 
applied for ethylene and 0.340 MPa (50 psig) for 
oxygen, the terminal velocity was slightly lower 
than 2000 m/s. The estimated equivalence ratio for 
the mixture is 0.44, which is approaching lean limit 
for the propagation of near C-J detonation waves. 
Similarly, the actual mixture stoichiometry may be 
closer to stoichiometric due to the reduction in the 
measured detonation velocity in the small channel. 
The high-speed visualization also shows that 
duration of the reaction wave propagation phase is 
very short in the microchannel. The thrust duty 
cycle for the pulsed detonation microthruster is 
very short. It takes ~ 0.2 ms for the detonation 
wave to travel from the ignition spot to the exit, so 
the duty cycle is potentially on the order of 1 % 
when operated at 100 Hz.

300 m/s, which is approximately the sonic speed of 
the unburned gas. The average velocities between 
ignition spot and P2 for all 5 cases were close, at ~ 
500 m/s. The average velocities between P2 and P3 
in = 1 and 1.25 mixtures were already over 2000 
m/s, while the velocities for the other cases were 
still at approximately 1500 m/s. The velocity 
trends of = 1 and 1.5 cases showed that the 
propagating velocities were reaching asymptotic 
values as the waves propagated towards the exit. 
The sudden velocity surge followed by near C-J 
velocities indicates that transition to detonation 
occurred in the section between P2 and P3 for the 
mixtures. The velocity trend for  = 1.5 case 
shows that the pressure wave was still accelerating 
between P3 and P4. 
Velocities between P3 and P4 were all beyond 
2000 m/s except in  = 0.5 mixture. The lower 
average velocity between P3 and P4 and the 
relatively higher peak pressure at P4 further justify 
that transition to detonation occurred in the vicinity 
of P4 location in the  = 0.5 mixture. Detonation 
induction distance was shorter in = 0.75 mixture 
comparing to  = 0.5 mixture. The velocities 
between P2 and P3 were almost identical in  = 
0.5 and 0.75 mixtures, but the average velocity 
between P3 and P4 in  = 0.75 case were 
considerably higher. Transition to detonation 
therefore occurred in the section between P3 and 
P4, and the velocity overshoot during the transition 
enhances the velocity average. In general, both the 
high-speed visualization and the pressure 
measurements prove the feasibility of utilizing 
valveless pulsed detonation as the mechanism for 
thrust generation at sub-millimeter scale using 
ethylene/oxygen mixtures.

MPa in one successive pulsed detonation cycle 
Figs. 7 show the pressure pulses at P4 when the 
pulsed detonation channel operates at 100 Hz 
under different ethylene and oxygen supply 
pressures. It takes 70 – 90 s for the flame wave to 
reach P4 after ignition voltage breakdown for the 
case with PC2H4 equals to 0.207 MPa. Similar run-
up time is required for cases with 0.275 MPa 
ethylene supply pressure. The peak pressures of the 
pulses are over 2.75 Mpa. Figs 7(c) shows the 
arrival time of the reaction wave in PC2H4/ PO2 
equals to 0.346/0.207 MPa takes ~120 μs which is 
longer than the other cases. 
Ethylene and oxygen consumption rates are 
metered by pressure tranducers on the supply 
cylinder, which is 1 liter in volume. The pressure 
changes after 15 sec of pulsed operation are 
converted into mass consumption rates by applying 
ideal gas law. Table. 2 show the impulse bit and
