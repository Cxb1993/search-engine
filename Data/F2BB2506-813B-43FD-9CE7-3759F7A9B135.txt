 Serious defects such as spiking, cold 
shuts, root porosity readily occur in 
high-intensity electron or laser beam 
keyhole welding. Spiking represents a 
non-uniform, irregular or periodic 
projection in the root of the fusion zone. 
Many spikes have voids in lower portions 
because molten metal does not fill in 
completely. When molten metal flows into 
spikes it can easily trap bubbles of 
contaminant gases. If cooling rate is rapid, 
the fluid may freeze before the gases can 
be convected away. This gives rise to 
porosity in the fusion zone. A cold shut or 
crack also takes place for a rapid cooling.  
 A keyhole (or cavity) oscillated in size 
and shape during high-intensity beam 
welding, as first observed by Tong and 
Giedt [1]. Tong and Giedt [2] proposed that 
when the electron-beam strikes the surface 
of the molten pool, the intense heating 
vaporizes the material and the recoil 
pressure exerts a downward force on the 
melt. The cavity is observed to grow 
latterly near its base, but constrict at a 
higher location. The melt eventually rolls 
over or slides into the cavity leaving a 
large melt region beneath the electron 
beam and through which the electron beam 
must once again penetrate. The severity of 
spiking (and rippling) depends on the 
frequency of the oscillation of the cavity, 
welding speed, and the material to be 
welded.  
 Armstrong [3] found that spiking was 
controlled by power and its density. 
Raising the focal spot above the surface the 
root became smoother but the penetration 
also decreased. Spiking seemed to be a 
direct function of high concentration, and 
anything that reduces the heat 
concentration would reduce spiking and 
penetration. Weber et al. [4] used a pinhole 
camera with X-ray exposures to observe 
the impact point between the beam and 
metal. The beam may strike the cavity 
periodically from the base to half way up 
the cavity wall near the surface in a few 
millisecond. This reflected a 
closure-fallback mechanics. When the 
beam striked the cavity base, the liquid at 
the base is heated and pushed up the cavity 
wall. As the liquid layer began to thicken, 
it ceased the upward movement and finally 
falled back into the cavity as a closure. 
Once the closure formed, the beam was 
intersected. Lower portions of the cavity 
cooled and even solidified. Spiking 
resulted when the closure-fallback 
mechanism failed so that the electron beam 
dwelled on the cavity base.  
 Arata et al. [5] used a cine-fluoroscopic 
technique to study dynamic behaviors of 
the keyhole. Spiking was found to be 
related to the movement of wall-caves and 
wall-knobs from strong oscillation of the 
keyhole wall. Schauer and Giedt [6] 
proposed a dimensionless ratio S defined 
as a length ratio H/ h to predict tendency 
for spiking. The length H represents the 
distance between the keyhole base and the 
location where surface tension and vapor 
pressure becomes equilibrium. As S is 
greater than 0.5 spiking became serious. 
Tsukamoto and Irie [7] found that as the 
focal spot was located at the keyhole base 
spikes readily took place. 
 Giedt [8] proposed a model to predict 
the periodic melting of spiking. Spiking 
resulted from the peak beam intensity 
momentarily concentrated on the cavity 
base. The time scale for the formation of a 
spike was the ratio between the energy 
distribution parameter and welding speed. 
It is found that the depth ratio between 
spike and fusion zone is inversely 
proportional to 0.638 power of Peclet 
number but independent of beam power.  
 Wei and Ho [9] proposed that spiking is 
due to relative motions between the focal 
spot and keyhole base. As the focal spot is 
above the base, energy flux absorbed is 
lower in the central region. For the focal 
spot below the base, energy flux absorbed 
is similar to a Gaussian distribution. Hence, 
absorption exhibits a sudden increase near 
the axisymmetric axis as the focal spot 
changes from above to below the base. 
Strong and periodic melting therefore 
occurs at the base.  
 Experimental and theoretical study of 
surface rippling on pure metals and alloys 
with negative surface tension coefficient 
was first provided by Wei et al. [10]. 
 
Surface roughness on 5083 Al is 
shown in Fig. 1 (a)-(c). It can be seen that 
spiking, rippling, and fusion zone width are 
increased with decreasing welding speed, 
and lowering the focal spot location. Fig. 
2(a) and (b) show that the spiking and 
rippling both become serious as the focal 
spot was lowered. It can also be seen that 
porosity and cold shuts occur with spiking.  
 Fig. 3(a) and (b) show spiking and 
rippling on the surface of 1050 Al. It can 
be seen that spiking and rippling are 
comparatively better those in welding 5083 
Al. The difference lies in the volatile 
element of Mg, as can be seen from Eqs. (1) 
and (6). Fig. 4 confirms spiking amplitude 
as a function of welding speed for different 
focal locations.  
 
五、結論 
 
1. Spiking and rippling for 5083 Al are 
worse than 1050 Al. The reason for this is 
that a volatile solute Mg exists in 5083 Al. 
2. Spiking, rippling, and fusion zone 
width and depth are decreased with 
increasing welding speed. 
3. Spiking and rippling increase by 
lowering the focal spot from above to 
below the workpiece surface.
