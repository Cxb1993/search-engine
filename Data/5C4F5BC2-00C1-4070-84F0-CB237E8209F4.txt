2. Configuration and Magnetic Field in AMS01 
The AMS01 adopts the new high magnetic energy product Neodydium iron boron (NdFeB) material with the 
inner diameter in 1.1m, the outer diameter in 1.4m, length in 0.8m and weight about 1.9 tons. The magnet is 
divided into 64 fan-shaped magnetic blocks to arrange along the circumference. The angle difference of 
magnetized direction for each magnetic block is about 11.250. For example, the magnetized direction of No.1 
magnetic block is 5.62500, the second is 16. 87500,…, No. 33 is -354.37500,…, No. 64 is -5. 62500. The magnet 
adopts the magic ring structure to limit the stray magnetic field. The magnet is with the characteristics of light 
weigh, strong magnetic field, small leak field, small dipole moment etc.. The distribution of magnetic induction 
is calculated by the finite element method.. It shows that the central magnetic induction B is 0.138 T. 
Because of the dissimilarity of the working point in each permanent block in the AMS01 magnet, it makes 
the magnet has dipole moments which are in the opposite direction of the main magnetic field. The AMS 
magnet installed in the satellite will be launched by the rocket into the space. Due to the satellite platen with 
small weight, the influence of the dipole moment should be near to zero so as to control the satellite operation. 
The interaction between the dipole moment in the AMS magnet and earth magnetic field to generate the torque 
is more than 1000 times as the total disturbing torque from the satellite platen. Therefore, the problem of dipole 
moment is critical to the operation of the AMS01 in outer space. Based on the original design requirement by 
NASA, the AMS will be transported by shuttle and operated in the international space station, therefore the 
interactive torque between the dipole moment and the earth magnetic field should be less than 2.7 Nm. On the 
operating orbit of the magnet, the Earth’s magnetic induction B is about 5×10-5 T, which equals 5.4×104 Am2 in 
the dipole moment.  
3. Measuring Method and Devices for Dipole Moment 
If the permanent magnet AMS01 has a dipole moment, when it is put in the magnetic field, the interaction of 
the magnetic field and dipole moment will result in a torque. The torque is calculated as following: BPT ×= , 
where P is the dipole moment, B is the background magnetic induction. The AMS01 magnet is in the 
homogenous magnetic field generated by the Helmholtz coils, the interaction between the background magnetic 
field and AMS magnetic field generates the torque. If the torque through the spring balance is measured, the 
dipole moment of AMS01 can be calculated. The experiment research by the method was carried out to 1/3 
model magnet, the 1/3 model permanent magnet consists of 64 blocks of N30 NdFeB with the length of 0.3 m, 
the inner radius of 0.157 m, the outer radius in 0.173 m, gap between blocks in 0 m. The background magnetic 
induction is 10-3 T.  
A. Design of the practical measuring system 
Fig.1. illustrates the device for the measurement of dipole moment. The Helmholtz coils are with the diameter 
about 3.4m and the distance between tow coils in 1.8 m, the total turns of each coil is 150. The bigger size of the 
coils can obtain more uniform of magnetic induction. The coils are designed to generate central magnetic 
induction more than 1.5×10-3 ∼2.0×10-3T. The continuously operating time is over 4 h with operating constant 
DC power supply.  
B. Measurement result of the coil magnetic induction 
In order to test the magnetic induction B of the coils, two different methods were used. The magnetic 
induction in each coil is tested. The central magnetic induction of the Helmholtz coils can be calculated by the 
superposition principle. The measurement result of each coil is 4.3×10-4T at 10 A, this shows that the coil has a 
good symmetrical characteristic. Therefore, the total magnetic induction is about 8.6×10-4T.  
The second method is to test the total magnetic induction combined the Helmholtz coils and the AMS01 
magnet. The total magnetic induction is from the Helmholtz coils and AMS01 generated magnetic induction. If 
the directions of the two fields are the same, the central magnetic induction will increase, otherwise it decreases. 
When the current is 0 A, the central magnetic induction of the AMS01 magnet is 0.1344 T. When the current is

0.1m×0.1m×0.5m) magnets with the magnetic energy product about 230.4kJ/m3 can compensate dipole 
moments in 740Am2±20%. It shows that the permanent magnet blocks with the high magnetic energy product to 
compensate dipole moments are an effective method because of its light weight and small volume. It not only 
can greatly reduce the dipole moments which make the directly transmit AMS01 with satellite possible, but also 
brings less influence on magnetic induction distribution in the AMS01. Because of the symmetrical 
configuration of AMS01, the compensation to the AMS01 is not sensitive to the position and the distance to the 
central of the magnet. The experimental and numerical analysis showed that the reasonable installing position of 
permanent magnet blocks can reduce the influence to the central magnetic induction in AMS01. Compensating 
magnet blocks have a little influence on the field distribution of AMS01.

III. MEASURING METHOD AND DEVICES FOR DIPOLE MOMENT
If the permanent magnet AMS01 has a dipole moment, when
it is put in the magnetic field, the interaction of the magnetic
field and dipole moment will result in a torque. The torque is
calculated as following:
(1)
where is the dipole moment, is the background magnetic
induction. The AMS01 magnet is in the homogenous magnetic
field generated by the Helmholtz coils, the interaction between
the background magnetic field and AMS magnetic field gener-
ates the torque. If the torque through the spring balance is mea-
sured, the dipole moment of AMS01 can be calculated by (1).
The experiment research by the method was carried out to 1/3
model magnet, the 1/3 model permanent magnet consists of 64
blocks of N30 NdFeB with the length of 0.3 m, the inner radius

of 0.157 m, the outer radius in 0.173 m, gap between blocks in
0 m. The background magnetic induction is T.
A. Design of the Practical Measuring System
Fig. 2 illustrates the device for the measurement of dipole mo-
ment. The Helmholtz coils are with the diameter about 3.4 m and
the distance between tow coils in 1.8 m, the total turns of each
coil is 150. The bigger size of the coils can obtain more uniform
of magnetic induction. The coils are designed to generate cen-
tral magnetic induction more than T.
The continuously operating time is over 4 h with operating con-
stant DC power supply.
B. Measurement Result of the Coil Magnetic Induction
In order to test the magnetic induction of the coils, two dif-
ferent methods were used. The magnetic induction in each coil
is tested. The central magnetic induction of the Helmholtz coils
can be calculated by the superposition principle. The measure-
ment result of each coil is T at 10 A, this shows that
the coil has a good symmetrical characteristic. Therefore, the
total magnetic induction is about T.
The second method is to test the total magnetic induction
combined the Helmholtz coils and the AMS01 magnet. The total
magnetic induction is from the Helmholtz coils and AMS01
generated magnetic induction. If the directions of the two fields
are the same, the central magnetic induction will increase, other-
wise it decreases. When the current is 0 A, the central magnetic
induction of the AMS01 magnet is 0.1344 T. When the current
is 10 A, the central magnetic induction of the AMS01 magnet is
0.1336 T. When the current direction is changed, the magnetic
induction direction will be opposite to that of AMS01 magnet,

effective way to reduce dipole moment. The permanent magnet
blocks with high magnetic energy product are employed. In
Sections I and III, NdFeB permanent magnet blocks with size of
m m m were installed, the dipole moments
decreased from 220 Am to 110 Am . When the NdFeB per-
manent magnet blocks with size of m m m
are fixed as above methods, the dipole moments are reduced to
very small.
The compensating methods for dipole moment in AMS01
are studied. The dipole moment with homogeneously magne-
tized permanent magnet block can be calculated as: ,
where is intensity of magnetization, is the volume. The
NdFeB permanent magnetic material with relative permeability
is approximately zero. If we want to compensate 7300 Am ,
the weight of permanent magnets of N47 is about 50 kg. The
permanent magnet blocks effectively reduce the dipole moment
of AMS01. Numerical analysis by FEA implies that permanent
magnet blocks of N47 NdFeB with size in m m
m can compensate the dipole moment of 7300 Am to
zero.
The additional permanent magnet blocks effectively reduce
dipole moment, but it has a little influence on the distribution
of main field in AMS01 magnet. Fig. 5 shows the distribution
of magnetic induction . The distance on the Fig. 5 is from the
center of the compensation magnet blocks to the center of the
AMS01. The compensation magnet blocks are N47 and about
50 kg weight. The influence on the main field is neglected when
the distance is over 1.0 m.
To check the numerical analysis and 1/3 model magnet ex-
perimental results, we take four permanent magnet blocks with
the dimension of m m m to be fixed outside of
AMS01 as shown in Fig. 1(a). The direction of magnetization is
along side length of 0.5 m in the cuboid with the magnet energy
produce in 230.4 kJ/m . The installation of permanent block is
based on as follows:
1) To fix two magnet blocks in sections of I and III as shown
in Fig. (1a), then test of dipole moments;
2) To add two magnet blocks in sections of II and IV, then test
of dipole moments;
3) To subtract two magnets from Sections II and IV, and then
test of dipole moments;
4) To subtract another two magnet blocks from the section of
I and the section of III, then test dipole moments.
The detailed experimental results show that two permanent
magnet blocks can compensate AMS01 dipole moment in
740 Am . The theoretical analysis shows about 860 Am . It
has small influence on the inner magnetic field distribution for
AMS01 magnet due to adding permanent magnet blocks. After
adding permanent magnet block in the sections of I and III,
it results in the center magnetic induction to increase about
T.
VI. CONCLUSION
Experiment shows that the dipole moment in the AMS01 is
about Am . According to the current testing en-
vironment and available permanent magnets, the 7.5 kg (two
magnets with the size of m m m) magnets with
the magnetic energy product about 230.4 kJ/m can compensate
dipole moments in Am . It shows that the permanent
magnet blocks with the high magnetic energy product to com-
pensate dipole moments are an effective method because of its
light weight and small volume. It not only can greatly reduce the
dipole moments which make the directly transmit AMS01 with
satellite possible, but also brings less influence on magnetic in-
duction distribution in the AMS01. Because of the symmetrical
configuration of AMS01, the compensation to the AMS01 is not
sensitive to the position and the distance to the central of the
magnet. The experimental and numerical analysis showed that
the reasonable installing position of permanent magnet blocks
can reduce the influence to the central magnetic induction in
AMS01. Compensating magnet blocks have a little influence on
the field distribution of AMS01.

Abstract 
The development of magnetic suspension (MS) technology has been widely applied 
in high-tech industry.  MS actuator has features of contact-free, friction-free, low 
contamination and low noise.  This paper describes the design and examination of 
the hybrid MS actuator referring to our previous works with different analysis 
aspect to improve the overall performance of actuator and system. The re-designed 
MS actuator is analyzed and controlled by deriving its magnetic force and system 
state equations.  This paper uses Solid Work for design process, ad 
MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the stability and robustness of system. The sliding 
mode control (SMC) is applied in the balance and stable the classic ball and beam 
system.  The drive circuit and MS actuators are controlled by the microcontroller 
in ball and beam system, and it accomplishes the mechatronics.  The stable control 
of system is to derive the dynamic equation of ball and beam system and uses SMC 
to simulate.  The combined SMC and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) are also 
introduced to control the adjustable stable position.  Different situations are tested 
separately with conformed results to desired responses.  Finally, comparison and 
analyses of the results in laboratory (1) have presented good improvements on the 
proposed system.

1. Introduction 
New advanced technologies and well-developed high technologies dominate world industry as a 
modern trend.  Mechanical equipment is still relatively fundamental to most industries but is 
demanding for better precision and better performance.  The traditional precision machines are 
cooperated with other mechanisms to reach the anticipated system performance quality.  Several 
practical problems are confronted in the machine, such as friction, vibration, noise, heat, and etc.  To 
overcome the above mentioned problems, the system can be improved by its machining precision, or 
applying lubricant to reduce friction, and introducing control force to lessen vibration.  The magnetic 
suspension technology is a feasible solution to improve the traditional mechanical system defeats in 
study (2).  The magnetic suspension system decreases the mechanical system from heat damage 
resulting from contact, friction and vibration and extends the machine lifecycle, to release mechanism 
size problem, but improve its precision substantially. 
The principle of magnetic suspension system counteracts the weight of controlled material by 
magnetic force, and levitates operating parts in the open space in contact-free manner.  Conventional 
mechanical damage resulting from friction and contact can be eliminated to enhance the operating 
capability.  The features of magnetic suspension system are suitable for many different fields, such as 
magnetically levitated transport track, magnetic bearing, magnetic suspended wind tunnel, precision

Consider the MS system by neglecting air resistance and mechanical friction, the equation of 
motion describing by Newton’s Second Law of Motion to get: 
and adjust its angle to change the ball position.  Two power supplies are used to offer actuator drive 
and microprocessor controller to separate ground to avoid interference from analog circuit to digital 
circuit.  The system procedure is reading the signal of ball position from the sensor by the way of 
analog to digital converter (ADC) of microcontroller.  Next step, the microcontroller calculates the 
current using the control software.  The control signal sends to the drive circuit by Pulse Width 
Modulation (PWM); then, the control current conveys to MS actuator from drive circuit.  The process 
is repeating until the ball reaches at the target position.  In Figure 4, the ball position sensor consists 
of a bronze cylinder and an acrylic cylinder.

4. Dynamic Model of the Ball and Beam System 
In this ball and beam system, Newton’s Second Law can be used for derivation.  In order to avoid 
an incomplete consideration of force, the Euler-Lagrange method is actually used to derive the dynamic 
behavior of the ball and beam system.  Euler-Lagrange is processing by calculating energy, and can 
effectively deal with more complex conditions. 
4.1 Single Control Force in the Ball and Beam System 
The motion equation of proposed system as illustrated in Figure 5, the beam is controlled to rotate 
in the vertical plane by applying a torque to the pivot at left end from the right side actuator.  The 
beam rotates in either counterclockwise or clockwise on the horizontal plane (1).  The ball needs to 
remain in contact with the beam to connect the ball position sensor by rolling without sliding.  This

By applying the Euler-Lagrange’s equation, the mathematical model for the proposed system is

5. Application of SMC in the Ball and Beam System 
The ball and beam system control is a classic non-linear control problem.  Following the previous 
work by Lin and Ker (1) on the ball and beam system, the sliding mode control method is adopted in this 
paper to simplify its control complexity.  MATLAB / Simulink is also used to verify the feasibility of 
SMC method. 
Considering the ball and beam system, the state-space equation of the single control force in the 
ball and beam system becomes:  
are shown in Figure 8.  The test response indexes are obtained as: Setting time=3.2 sec, 
Overshoot=83.7%, Rise time=0.2 sec, Peak time=0.9 sec.

6. Application of FSMC in the Ball and Beam System 
After L. A. Zadeh created the fuzzy set theory in 1965 (4), the fuzzy set theory has been widely 
used in systems engineering, signal process, control engineering and other fields.  Fuzzy logic control 
law let the control law express a set of qualitative conditional statements and inaccurate decision rules, 
and quantify it by fuzzy mathematics.  To improve the control effect, fuzzy logic control is combined 
to sliding mode control in the ball and beam system (5)(6).  The control forces source is provided by 
either one or both MS actuators.  Finally, compares both performances by their responses. 
Figure 9 shows the control flowchart.  First of all, the analogy to digital converter of MSP430 
reads the data of ball’s current position.  When the data are read cumulatively to five, the bubble sort 
method will sort the data and choose the middle value as the desired data.  Bubble sort method 
removes the larger and smaller data that decrease the error while converting from analog to digital.  
With the purpose of recognizing the position and velocity, the desired data must be two.  Although 
 Fig. 11 Direction for ball position error, ball velocity and control input. 
 
The rule of Table 2 is like the fuzzy sliding mode control, when the current state is far from the set 
point.  The system will be given a large control force to stable the beam.  However, when the current 
state is near to the sliding surface, the system will oscillate around the set point.  Therefore, the 
system must be coordinated with rule table or forecast table as Table 3.

In Table 3, the forecast table predicts the next step and let the control force occur in advance to improve 
the stability control system.  In this way, it can take a brake before the state reaches to the equilibrium 
position, so that the speed of the ball will drop zero.

7. Conclusions 
This paper presents the design of MS actuator and its application in a ball and beam system.  The 
design concept is based on the previous analysis of the magnetic field simulation and the results of 
implementation in our laboratory (2, 3).  The drawing software “Solid Work” is applied to establish the 
component design and to simulate its combination state.  Accordingly, the design to derive the 
magnetic force equation for MS actuator is successfully accomplished.  Besides, the 
MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the system control performance.  The system hardware and 
software implementations including MS actuator, drive circuit, sensor system, microcontroller and 
controller, are accomplished in mechatronics of hybrid MS actuator with a new version. 
By carefully examining our previous work (1), some modeling improvement as well system 
dynamic formulations are discussed in the paper.  The improvement has lead into better performance 
result in the constructed ball and beam system.  
In order to test the performance of the MS actuator, so as to apply a pair of MS actuators into the 
ball and beam system, both MS actuator and the ball and beam system are nonlinear obtained from the 
dynamic equation.  FSMC system is applied to simply the control effort on this the nonlinear ball and 
beam system.  The test items of MS actuator examine the position tracking and the external 
disturbance recovery.  The ball and beam system controls the ball to stop at any position on the beam, 
by either at pivoted operation or two-end free operation of the proposed MS actuators separately as 
input control forces.  Finally, the observed response of system operation determines the superiority of 
the fuzzy sliding mode performance in this type of system.  
MATLAB/Simulink simulates the MS actuator and the ball and beam system using the sliding
