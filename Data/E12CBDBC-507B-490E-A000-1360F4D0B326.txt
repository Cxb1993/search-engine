Abstract  
Many rivers in western area of Taiwan are 
nearly perpendicular to the major north-south 
highways. The rivers in Taiwan usually have 
steep slope gradients and rapid flows. During 
the typhoon or storm seasons, the flood stages 
usually vary rapidly and the flood durations are 
short for these rivers. 
The main objective of this 2-year project is 
to conduct a series of experiment to examine 
the physical characteristics of the clear water 
bridge scour around the non-uniform piers 
under steady and unsteady flows. Besides the 
laboratory experiments, a simulation model is 
developed to simulate the temporal variations 
of the local scours around the non-uniform 
piers with discontinuous surface located at 
different elevations (i.e. different exposure 
elevations). Emphasis is placed on the process 
of enlargement of the scour hole near the 
discontinuous surface of the pier. The results of 
this study highlight our understanding of the 
physical process of steady bridge scour around 
non-uniform piers. By analyzing experimental 
data with steady flows, a scheme is proposed to 
calculate the temporal variation of scour depth 
with unsteady flows. In general, the simulated 
results based on the proposed method 
correspond well with the experimental data. 
Keywords: unsteady flow, non-uniform pier, 
local scour 
二、前言與研究目的 
台灣西部河川與南北主要道路呈現垂直
交錯，必須構築跨河橋樑聯絡交通，以利河
川兩岸居民之生活與經濟活動。近數十年來
國內經濟發展迅速，交通運輸需求量增加，
且土地利用與集水區過度開發，導致河道遷
移或沖刷加劇，影響跨河橋樑基礎之安全。
此外，台灣河川坡陡流急，並有人為砂石開
採問題，自民國 85 年迄今，已發生諸多因沖
刷而導致橋樑基礎裸露或沉陷，甚至如高屏
與后豐大橋斷橋等嚴重事件。 
目前橋樑基礎設計多以沉箱及群樁基礎
為主，甚少採用單圓柱形式之基礎。無論沉
箱或群樁基礎，其基礎與墩柱之間皆存在一
不連續面（墩柱沉箱基礎或群樁樁帽之交界
面），執橋墩沖刷研究牛耳之美國聯邦公路總
署(FHWA)與地質調查所（USGS）已發展出
著名之 HEC-18（Richardson and Davis, 2001）
等局部沖刷經驗式。然其僅限於定量流平衡
沖刷之試驗結果，且大多針對基礎裸露之情
況作探討。在覆土面鄰近不連續面之狀況，
一旦洪水刷開不均勻面，橋墩迎水面積增
加，沖刷速率將急遽上昇，橋樑在短時間內
即可能陷入危險狀態。 
考慮橋墩基礎之幾何複雜性與河川之變
量流特性，傳統橋墩沖刷預估公式或模式顯
得不敷使用。此外，以長時間定量流況所推
導之平衡沖刷公式，作為橋墩設計之準則，
可能高估沖刷量而造成浪費。因此，在兼顧
安全與經濟效益之前提下，非均勻橋墩基礎
局部沖刷歷程之研究，深具其迫切性。

 (2) 定量流均勻墩沖刷模式 
Melville（1975）與 Hjorth（1977）認為墩
前馬蹄形渦流主導沖刷歷程之發展，Kothyari
（1992）以此一概念提出沖刷歷程之模式。

Mia 與 Nago（2003）更進一步利用此沖刷
概念，假設沖刷坑之體積可近似於正倒三角
錐，並應用 Yalin（1977）河川平衡輸沙公式，
發展出均勻圓柱形橋墩之沖刷模式。由實驗
觀察得知，隨著墩前渦流逐漸增大，沖刷坑
體積亦逐漸加大，且墩前渦流挾帶泥砂顆粒
之強度亦隨之減弱，一旦渦流強度減弱至無

墩於變量流清水沖刷之條件下，其沖刷歷程
可藉由定量流作用下之沖刷歷程予以疊加來

圖 7 變量流流量歷線型態 
本研究以中峰型歷線為例進行解說，詳細
圖 8 顯示各個定量流流量梯段之個別沖刷過
程，其中各梯段流量大小關係為 Q0＜Q1＜Q2
＜Qp 。就流量為 Q0 之試驗而言，歷經 Δt 時
間，定量流之沖刷歷程為曲線 A (沖刷深度由
0 到 ds1)，將此歷程疊加至變量流第一個梯段
之沖刷曲線 A′，如圖 9 所示。於變量流第一
個梯段流量沖刷歷程 A′結束後，其沖刷深度
ds1 即成為第二個梯段流量 Q1 之沖刷歷程 B′
之起始沖刷深度。 
進入第二流量 Q1，此時沖刷深度達橋墩之
不均勻面，下降流受不均勻面之影響而受
阻，墩前沖刷深度停留在不均勻面上，形成
墩前沖刷深度不變，而沖刷坑體積卻逐漸擴
大之現象。 
定量流Q1沖刷歷程B直接疊加至變量流之
第二流量梯段，疊加後呈現沖刷深度不變之
情形。於變量流第二個梯段流量沖刷歷程 B′
結束後，其沖刷深度 ds2即成為第三個梯段流
量沖刷歷程C′之起始沖刷深度。同樣地，就
流量為 Q2 而言，變量流第三個梯段流量沖刷
歷程C′  (沖刷深度由 ds2到 ds3)會與定量流沖
刷歷程 C 相同。 
於變量流第三梯段流量沖刷歷程 C′結束
後，其沖刷深度 ds3 即成為第四梯段流量沖刷
歷程 D’之起始沖刷深度，故可將定量流沖刷
歷程 D (沖刷深度介於 ds3 與 ds4)，視為變量
流第四梯段之沖刷歷程 D′。

The field experiments for the bridge scour was conducted in the middle Cho-Shui River, the 
longest river in Taiwan.  There was no scour countermeasures at the Ming-Chu Bridge.  The 
drainage area upstream of the bridge is 2,105 km2.  There is a low weir named Chi-Chi Weir 
located about 6.5 km upstream of the Ming-Chu Bridge.  As there is no tributary between the 
weir and the bridge, the discharge measured at the Chi-Chi Weir is fairly close to the flow at 
the bridge.  The average river bed slope near the bridge is about 1/140. 
Figure 1 gives the typical size distribution of the bed material for the Ming-Chu Bridge.  The 
median size was d50 = 35 mm, and the geometric standard deviation gσ  = 14.1, indicating a 
remarkable nonuniform gradation. 
The Ming-Chu Bridge was built in 1990.  The bridge consists of 28 spans and 29 cylindrical 
columns each of 2.2 m diameter. Each column rests on the center of a cylindrical concrete 
footing of 5.6 m diameter buried below the streambed.  The peak discharge of record was 
13,500 m3/s, which occurred on July 30, 2001. According to the flood frequency analysis, the 
5-year and the 100-year flood flows at the site are 6,800 m3/s and 16,700 m3/s, respectively.

FIELD EXPERIMENTS 
 
Existing local scour monitoring systems such as SMC (sliding magnetic collar) and FBG 
(fiber Bragg grating sensor) are not suitable for steep rivers because of the possible damages 
induced by the debris in the rapid flows.  After careful consideration of safety, reliability and 
the cost of the instruments, both general and local scour depths were measured with the 
“numbered-brick columns”.  
In general, the maximum general and total scour depths occur in the main channel of a river.  
To select the location of the scour monitoring system, both field investigations and the 
aerophotos taken during the typhoon seasons were considered.  Figure 2 shows the aerial view 
of the Cho-Shui River during the receding flood stage of Typhoon Toraji, which occured on 
July 2, 2001 and had a flood peak of 13,500 m3/s.  With consideration of the cross sectional 
measurement after the flood, the upstream pier P9 for the Ming-Chu Bridge was selected as 
the best location for bridge scour monitoring.  In fact, as shown in Figure 3, P9 was again 
located near the center of the main channel during Typhoon Mindulle, which occured on July 
6, 2004 and had a flood peak of 7,250 m3/s.

COMPARISONS OF LOCAL SCOUR FORMULAS 
Two major flood events had been observed during the study period, i.e. Typhoons Dujuan 
(Sept. 2, 2003) and Mindulle (July 2~6, 2004).  Figure 5 gives the hydrographs near the 
Ming-Chu Bridge for these two floods.  As shown in Figure 5, the peak flow duration for 
Typhoon Dujuan was longer than that for Typhoon Mindulle.  The measured and calculated 
field data for both events are summarized in Table 1.  The contraction scour depths were 
calculated with Laursen’s formula (1963). 
For the Typhoon Mindulle flood, it was found that the numbered-brick columns buried 
upstream and that at P9 were completely washed out during the flood.  Only the general scour 
depth downstream of P9 was measured accurately to dGD = 4.0 m.  In other words, the true 
total scour depth at P9 (dT) and the general scour depth upstream of P9 (dGU) were greater 
than 9 m and 6 m, respectively.  As an approximation, however, it is assumed that the scour 
depth was close to the thickness of the buried numbered-brick column when it was washed 
out by the flood, i.e. dT = 9 m and dGU = 6 m. 
Melville and Coleman (2000) found for a ratio of flow depth to pier diameter y/b exceeding 
about 1.5, the increasing rate of local scour depth is negligibly small.  For the flood event of 
Typhoon Mindulle, when dT = 9 m and dGU = 6 m, the calculated y/b value was 1.9.  
Therefore, the previous assumption was physically reasonable. 
As shown in Table 1, the ratio of general scour to total scour near the bridge (dGP/dT) 
increased with an increase of the peak flow discharge.  Moreover, the ratio of general scour to 
local scour (dGP/dLM) near the pier  may even be greater than 1 for high discharge.

Table 2 is a comparison of the calculated local scour depths using different scour formulas.  
The parameter values of the approach flows were calculated based on the peak discharges.  It 
is seen from these two flood events that the majority of the formulas overestimated the local 
scour depths (dLE/dLM >1).  Partial bed armoring occurred during the floods for the gravel 
river reach under investigation due to the wide bed material gradation.  Among the local scour 
formulas listed in Table 2, only the HEC-18 (1995) accounts for the bed armoring effect.  As 
a result, it gives the most accurate prediction in Table 2. 
Most of the empirical formulas overestimate the local scour depths based on the peak 
discharges.  This was mainly due to the fact that most of the bridge scour formulas were 
derived based on the data for equilibrium scour conditions.  Sometimes it may take several 
days for the experiment to reach an equilibrium condition (Melville and Chiew, 1999).  In the 
 A-6
Dujuan and Mindulle, respectively.  It is seen that the estimated scour depth was about 50% 
of the measured value when a peak flow duration of 6 hrs was assumed for either typhoon.  
However, the ratios of the estimated to the measured scour depths were 1.39 and 1.05 for 
Typhoons Dujuan and Mindulle, respectively when a peak flow duration of 1 hr was assumed.  
The results of Tables 3 and 4 imply that the effect of the peak flow duration on the scour 
prediction was significant.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Based on a field study conducted in a steep gravel river reach, the following conclusions can 
be drawn : 
1. In general, flows in steep river reaches are rapid and highly turbulent.  It is hard to apply 
the traditional equipment to measure the scour depths near the bridge piers for these sites 
since the equipment may be damaged due to debris problem.  In this case, the “numbered-
brick columns”, as used in this study, is a powerful tool for measuring either the maximum 
general or total scour depth, especially for ephemeral rivers. 
2. In this study, the general scour depths upstream and downstream of the bridge pier were 
measured to estimate the general scour at the bridge pier.  The local scour depth at the pier 
was then calculated by subtracting this estimated general scour depth and the contraction 
scour depth from the total scour depth.  This strict procedure is a more reasonable 
estimation of the “pure local scour depth.”

Abstract 
The development of a soil erosion prediction model applicable to Taiwan (subtropical area) is a very important 
issue for the sustainable development of soil and water resources. Both the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) 
and the Revised USLE (RUSLE) are the most widely used soil erosion prediction models in the world at present. 
However, the regional variability of the parameters (including the rainfall erosivity factor) needs to be 
considered during the application of the models. The main objective of this study is to investigate the variations 
of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) and the rainfall characteristics in different areas of Taiwan. 
 
Experimental results indicated that both the median raindrop diameter and the rainfall kinetic energy increased 
with an increase of the rainfall intensity. In general, for the western area of Taiwan (west of the Central 
mountains) the mean annual rainfall amount was about the same, while the mean annual rainfall erosion index 
increased with a decrease of the latitude due to the increasing effect of Typhoons. On the other hand, both the 
mean annual rainfall and the mean annual rainfall erosion index increased with an increase of the latitude due to 
the influence of the northeast monsoon for the northern and eastern areas of Taiwan. In addition, an isoerodent 
map of Taiwan was also developed for the practical application.

INTRODUCTION 
Soil erosion is caused by the interaction of the rainfall erosivity and the soil erodibility. Based 
on the raindrop size distribution data collected by Laws and Parsons (1943) at Washington D. 
C., Wischmeir and Smith (1958) developed a sem-logarithmic relationship between rainfall 
kinetic energy and rainfall intensity 
IE log331916 +=  (1) 
in which E  is the rainfall kinetic energy (ft-tonf/acre-in), and I  is rainfall intensity (in/hr). 
Wischmeir and Smith (1958) found that the soil loss for a rain storm is highly correlated to 
the product of rainfall kinetic energy and the maximum 30-min rainfall intensity. Both the 
Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE; Wischmeir and Smith, 1978) and the Revised USLE 
(RUSLE; Renard et al., 1997) are the most widely used soil erosion prediction models in the 
world at present. However, the regional variability of the parameters (including the rainfall 
erosivity factor) needs to be considered during the application of the models. 
In the USLE or RUSLE, the rainfall erosivity factor ( R -factor, an index of the rainfall erosive 
potential) is defined as 
100
30EIR =  (2) 
where 30I  is the maximum 30-min rainfall intensity (which indicates the prolonged-peak rates 
of detachment and runoff).

RAINDROPS COLLECTION AND ANALYZING SOFTWARE 
Raindrops collection 
In this study, natural raindrops are collected by means of dyed filter papers. The first step is to 
mix 1000 c.c. clear water with 1 gram chemical dye of Rhodamine B (Basic Violet 10). The 
solution is then used to dye the pure white U.K. Whatman number 1 filter paper pink. 
An artificial raindrop-collecting instrument was developed on the basis of camera shutter 
theory. During the rainfall, three samples of natural raindrops are collected at the same time in 
order to increase the quantity of raindrop samples in a single case, and to improve the 
accuracy of raindrop analysis. 
In our laboratory, the waterdrops are produced through a series of syringe needle heads of 
different diameters, and are regarded as spheres. Then they are allowed to fall freely from an 
airless tube of 9 meters high, and drop on the dyed filter paper below the tube. By regression 
analysis, the relation of the two factors is 
394.09576.1 AD =  (3) 
in which D  is the waterdrop diameter (in mm) and A  is the stained area (in cm2). Equation 
(3) can be used to transform the stained area of a natural raindrop collected through the dyed 
filter papers into raindrop diameter. 
 
Efficient raindrop image acquisition system 
Lu et al. (1996) developed an “efficient raindrop image acquisition system” to measure and 
analyze the natural raindrop dada. In this research, the method is further modified using 
Borland C++ language for the Windows platform. Based on the TWAIN_32 interface in the 
operation system, the software can be run with a color scanner, and thus scan the stains on the 
dyed filter papers. The natural raindrop size distribution can be accurately calculated when the 
stained areas, following the software identification and sequencing, are in operation with 
Equation (3). 
 
RAINFALL ENERGY CALCULATION 
For the convenience of calculations, a relationship between the raindrop terminal velocity v  
and raindrop diameter D (mm) is derived by the regression analysis using Gunn and Kinzer’s 
(1949) laboratory data as follows: 
32 0566.09044.09626.41927.0 DDDv +−+−=  (4) 
The unit rainfall kinetic energy (E, foot-tonf/ acre-in) for a rainfall event can then be 
calculated by 
∑∑= 32
2
1
iii VvmE  (5) 
in which im , iν  and iV  are the mass, terminal velocity and volume for the ith raindrop, 
respectively. Finally, based on the measured raindrop size and rainfall intensity data, 
relationships between the rainfall kinetic energy E and the rainfall intensity I, IbaE log+=  
for different test sites are developed.

Seasonal variation of rainfall erosivity 
Figure 3 shows a comparison of the monthly variations of the rainfall amount for various test 
sites. It can be seen that for most areas the highest monthly rainfall amount occurred during 
the period of June-September, i.e. typhoon seasons in summer and autumn. Due to the effect 
of the northeast monsoon, the rainfall amounts in winter for the northern and eastern areas 
were higher than those for the western areas. Figure 4 is a comparison of the monthly 
variations of the rainfall erosivity. Again, the highest R values occurred during the period of 
June-September for most areas. This trend is especially obvious for Kaoshiung and Chiayi 
 B-7
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the average-annual values of the erosion index in 
most areas of subtropical Taiwan are greater than 500 (100 ft·tonf·in/ac·hr·yr), while they are 
less than 550 (100 ft·tonf·in/ac·hr·yr) in most areas of the United States (Wischmeier and 
Simth, 1978). Hence, serious soil erosion hazards may occur when the vegetal cover is 
removed due to either the natural causes or human activities, e.g. earthquake or highway 
construction.
