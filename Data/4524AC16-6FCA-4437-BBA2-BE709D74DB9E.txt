一、 前言 
The family of the double random phase encryption (DRPE) schemes for image encryption 
was first proposed by Refregier and Javidi [1]. DRPE schemes for image encryption are 
important for image security. Later, Unnikrishnan and Singh [2] extended the DRPE scheme in 
the Fourier domain of Refregier and Javidi to the continuous fractional Fourier transform (FRT) 
domain by replacing the conventional continuous Fourier transform with the continuous FRT. 
The resulting keys for decryption of the DRPE scheme in the fractional Fourier domain include 
additional one fractional parameter of the employed continuous FRT and the random phase 
codes of the encryption process. Pei and Hsue further enhanced image security by proposing the 
DRPE in the multiple-parameter discrete fractional Fourier transform (MPDFRFT) domain to 
encrypt digital images. The MPDFRFT domain encryption method significantly improves data 
security because all of the multiple fractional parameters of the MPDFRFT can be used as keys 
for decryption.   
 
二、研究目的 
Youssef [3] recently claimed that the family of the DRPE schemes for image encryption is 
linear and thus is vulnerable to the plaintext attack, no matter they are in discrete Fourier 
transform (DFT), discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFRFT), or MPDFRFT domain. 
Although some researchers think that the plaintext attack is not very useful for linear image 
encryption method because it requires one to know a huge number of plaintext-ciphertext image 
pairs [4]. However, the DRPE schemes for image encryption are insecure in theory since they 
are linear. In this project, we propose a method to nonlinearize the DRPE schemes in the DFT, 
DFRFT and MPDFRFT domains to enhance security of this family of important image 
encryption methods. 
 
三、文獻探討 
The DFRFT is a generalization of the DFT. In [5], Pei and Yeh defined a single-parameter 
DFRFT whose transform results approximate samples of the continuous FRT based on the 
Dickinson-Steiglitz commuting matrix of the DFT matrix [6]. The continuous FRT is the  
generalization of the conventional continuous Fourier transform [7]-[11]. Later, Candan et al. 
[12] consolidated and provided rigorous discussions on the definition of DFRFT in [5]. Pei and 
Hsue [13] extended the single-parameter DFRFT definition in [5] and proposed a 
multiple-parameter DFRFT (MPDFRFT). The MPDFRFT has N independent fractional 
parameters, where N is the number of the input data points. When all of the N fractional order 
parameters of the MPDFRFT are the same, the MPDFRFT degenerates to the DFRFT of Pei 
and Yeh [5].  
In [1], Refregier and Javidi first proposed a DRPE scheme in the Fourier domain for image 
encryption. In the DRPE scheme in the Fourier domain, two random phase encodings in the 
input plane and the Fourier plane are used to encrypt the input image, and the encrypted output 
image is demonstrated to be stationary white. Unnikrishnan and Singh [2] extended the DRPE 
scheme in the Fourier domain of Refregier and Javidi to the fractional Fourier transform 
domain by replacing the conventional continuous Fourier transform with the continuous FRT. 
The double random fractional Fourier domain encoding is the continuous version of the DRPE 
in the DFRFT domain [13]. In [13], Pei and Hsue further enhance image security by proposing 
the DRPE in the MPDFRFT domain to encrypt digital images. This MPDFRFT domain 
encryption method significantly improves data security because all of the additional fractional

Consequently, if one has N⋅M independent ciphertext-plaintext pairs, from (6), the 
key-dependent matrix K can be solved by N⋅M systems of linear equations, each with N⋅M 
unknown variables [3]. The required computation is O(NM⋅(NM)3)=O((NM)4). Since DFT and 
DFRFT are both special cases of the MPDFRFT [13], the DRPEs in the DFT, DFRFT and 
MPDFRFT domains are all linear and thus all vulnerable to this plaintext attack [3].

C. Some Notes on the Random Nonlinearizing Block 
 Some notes on the random nonlinearizing block are worthy to mention: 
1) The nonlinearizing block used in Fig. 4 should be random. If it is deterministic, the cracker 
can compute Q from ciphertext Q′ in Fig. 4. For this case, since the relationship between the 
plaintext P and Q in Fig. 4 is linear, one can still apply the plaintext attack to crack this 
encryption scheme. 
2) In Fig. 4, we place the random nonlinearizing block immediately before producing the output 
encrypted image. To make the DRPE in the MPDFRFT domain resistant for the plaintext attack, 
the random nonlinearizing block can also be placed at other stage of the encryption process in 
Fig. 4, for example, before or after the second random phase encoder [exp(jβ)]. However, the 
random nonlinearizing block can not be placed immediately before the first random phase 
encoder [exp(jα)]. One decryption output for this case with randomly generated decryption key 
R is shown in Fig. 6, which fails to protect information of the original input image. 
3) Since the DRPE in the MPDFRFT domain is an extension for both of the DRPEs in the DFT 
[1] and the DFRFT [2] domains, using random nonlinearizing block to nonlinearize and thus 
improve security for the DRPE in the MPDFRFT domain can also be applied to nonlinearize 
the DRPEs in the DFT and the DFRFT domains. In general, the nonlinearizing technique may 
also be applied for other existing linear encryption schemes to protect them from the plaintext 
attacks. 
 
五、結果與討論 
 For the random nonlinearizing technique to be effective for resisting the plaintext attack, it 
is necessary that the output decryption image in Fig. 5 is sensitive to errors of at least one of 
decryption keys random binary matrix R and the power factor b. In the following simulations, 
we assume that the decryption keys a , b , c , d  and random phase matrix β are known by 
the decryption process to focus on the effect of decryption keys errors for R and b. And the 
encryption keys a , b , c , d  and random phase matrix β are generated by the same methods 
described in [13]. Fig. 7(a) is the 256×256 original image to be encrypted. Fig. 7(b) is its 
corresponding encrypted image (magnitude only) using the random nonlinearized DRPE in the 
MPDFRFT domain. In Fig. 7(b), the employed encryption keys b=0.45 and entries of the 
256×256 random binary matrix R are independent and uniformly distributed over the 
two-element set {0,1}. Fig. 7(c) is the output decrypted image of Fig. 7(b) when all of the 
decryption keys are correct. Fig. 7(d) is the output decrypted image of Fig. 7(b) when the used 
decryption keys are b=0.45 and 2% of the entries of random binary matrix R are incorrect. Fig. 
7 shows that one can successfully decrypt the encrypted image if the decryption keys are known 
and the decrypted output is sensitive to errors of the random binary matrix encryption key. 
 To further understand sensitivity of decryption output to key errors of the random binary 
matrix R, Fig. 8 plots mean square errors (MSEs) in dB of output decrypted image B when 
various error percentages of entries of the random binary matrix R are used for decryption. In 
Fig. 8, all of the experiments use correct power factor b=0.45 for decryption and MSEs of ten 
independent realizations are averaged. The MSE between the output decrypted image B and the 
correct decrypted image P is defined as

 From our computer experiments, when the MSE is larger than 50dB, we cannot recognize
