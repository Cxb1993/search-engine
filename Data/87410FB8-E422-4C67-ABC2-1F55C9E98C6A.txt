Abstract 
The objective of this study is to establish a monthly water quality predicting model using a grammatical 
evolution (GE) programming system for Feitsui Reservoir in Northern Taiwan. Grammatical evolution (GE) 
has an ability to find out significant input variables and combine them to form mathematical equations 
automatically. In this study, GE model was fed with fifteen input variables to determine a reasonable 
nonlinear mathematical equation for predicting the total phosphorous (TP) concentration in reservoir. Three 
significant input variables, including two TP sources and maximum rainfall were chosen through GE process. 
Because the obtained GE model can effectively simulate the dynamics of reservoir water quality, a 
Macro-Genetic Algorithm (MGA) was then used as an optimization model mixed with this GE predicting 
model to control the nutrient loads from the watershed and maintain the in-reservoir TP concentration 
efficiently.

            | 1.0 …………………………………..…rule 1 
 
2.2 Mapping Process 
The genotype is used to map the start symbol onto terminals by reading codons of 8 bits to generate a 
corresponding integer value from which an appropriate production rule is selected by using the following 
mapping function: 
Rule = (codon integer value) MOD (number of rules for the current nonterminal)…….(1) 
Considering the following rule, i.e., given the nonterminal op, there are four production rules to select 
from: 
<op> :: = +  ………………………… ..rule 0 
         | -  …………………………. .rule 1                             |    
/  ………………………….. rule 2 
       |*  .…………………..…….. rule 3  
If we assume the codon being read produces the integer 6, then 
6 MOD 4 = 2 
would select <op> as rule 2:  /. Each time a production rule has to be selected to map from a 
nonterminal, another codon is read. In this way, the system traverses the genome. 
For example, considering the individual in Table 1, there are fourteen 8-bit binary codons in one string. 
The decoding process is described as follows: 
 
(1) First, concentrating on the start symbol <expr>, four possible productions to be chosen are distinguished. 
To make this choice, we read the first codon from the chromosome “11001000” and use it to generate a 
number “200”. Because the standard decode of the binary 11001000 equals to 200. This number will 
then be used to decide which production rule to use according to Eq. (1) in BNF. Thus, we have 200 
MOD 4 = 0, meaning we must take the zeroth production, rule (0), so that <expr> is now replace with 
<expr><op><expr>. 
 
(2) Continuing with the first <expr>, i.e., always starting from the leftmost nonterminal, a similar choice must 
be made by reading the next codon value 160 and again using the given formula we get 160 MOD 4 = 
0，i.e., rule 0. The leftmost <expr> will now be replaced with <expr><op><expr> to give

3. The Case Study 
3.1 Feitsui Reservoir 
Feitsui Reservoir at 25027’ N and 121033’ E is the most important reservoir of Northern Taiwan, 
supplying drinking water for more than five million people in the Taipei City. The main dam is located at the 
downstream of Peishih Creek, a tributary of Hsintien Creek (Fig. 2). The reservoir construction started in 
mid-1979 and completed in 1987 with an initial storage of 406× 106m3. It has a surface area of 10.24 km2 (at 
EL.170m), and its catchments area is 30 times the total reservoir area. With about 20 km in length, the 
mainstream is of meandering morphology. The effective storage capacity near the dam was 359 million m3, 
39.68 m and 113.5 m for the mean depth and maximum depth, respectively. The average bed slope is 0.3%. 
The main landscape in the reservoir watersheds is terrace and hardwood montane. Most banks of this reservoir 
are the previous agricultural farms, primarily tea farms, which were flooded after the reservoir operation. The 
average annual precipitation is around 2,500 mm or more. The main geological substrates are interstratified 
with sandstone and shale formed after the Oligocene. The primary soils are Entisol and Inceptisol according to 
Soil Taxonomy. Agricultural activities are surrounded the catchment area, while there are no industrial 
activities over the catchments, and accordingly the reservoir is isolated from any industrial pollution sources. 
The atmospheric influx and domestic sewage as well as agricultural fertilizers would be the primary sources for 
most anthropogenic chemicals. Feitsui reservoir is one of the most extensively monitored reservoirs in Taiwan. 
Although water quality in Feitsui Reservoir is among the best in Taiwan, the reservoir still receives much 
attention because of significant watershed nutrient loads. The nutrient loads are mainly from non-point 
agricultural and tourist activities. Under the Carlson trophic state index, water quality of the reservoir is listed 
as mesotrophic most of the time and eutrophic for only a few months in recent years.  
 
3.2 TP Data Set 
All the nutrient loads in Feitsui Reservoir were considered the summation of three sources of the main 
flow Peishih Creek and two tributaries, Diyu Creek and Kingkwa Creek in this case study (Fig. 2). The monthly 
monitoring data records of 1996–2005 were obtained from the Feitsui Reservoir Administration Bureau and the 
Research Center for Environmental Change, Academia Sinica. The first 6-year records were used for model 
training (calibration) and the following 4-year records for model testing (verification) The input variables 
includes the phosphorus loads (which indicates the main inflow Peishih Creek, the tributaries Diyu Creek, and 
Kingkwa Creek), two meteorological variables (including average and maximum rainfall inthe watershed), and 
two hydrological variables (including inflow and outflow). These seven input variables are chosen as the main 
factors to predict the TP in reservoir. Study done by Kuo et al. (2006) used similar data sets in reservoir water 
quality prediction. However, the TP concentrations in Feitsui Reservoir become increasingly high in recent 
years. Under such circumstance, by employing only the seven input variables early mentioned cannot achieve a 
satisfied accuracy of prediction in this study. Therefore, total fifteen input variables contain seven input 
variables described above at time step t and the other seven input variables: their values one step ahead (time 
step t-1), as well as one input variable: the TP in reservoir at time step t-1. This system identification problem 
may be viewed as a searching for a proper function (and its parameters) which maps fifteen input values onto an 
output value (average TP in reservoir at time step t). Table 2 presents the statistical parameters of the data set 
used in this study in order to prescreen the data characteristics. In the Table 2, the xmean, Sx, Cv, xmax and xmin 
 6
satisfied or a predetermined number of generations are achieved. According to a couple of our previous works, 
real-coded GAs has advantages over binary coded GAs (Chang and Chen, 1998; Chen, 2003a; Chang et al., 
2005). Hence, in this study, we only considered real-coded GAs. Blend crossover (BLX-α) uniformly picks 
values that lie between two points contain the two parents, but may extend equally on either side determined by 
a user specified GA-parameter α (Chen and Chang, 2007). 
In standard GA, the selection operator chooses individuals with a probability proportional to their relative 
fitness, but this can lead to “premature convergence”. Therefore, a macro-evolutionary algorithm (MA) is 
presented as a selection scheme to improve the capability of searching global optimum solutions in GA, which 
is called MGA. Unlike population-level evolution, which is employed in standard evolutionary algorithms; 
MGA is evolution at the higher level. The model exploits the presence of links between “species” that represent 
candidate solutions to the optimization problem (Chen, 2003 b). In addition, MGA has many advantages when 
compared with GA using a traditional selection operator. First, MGA can reach higher fitness values than 
traditional GAs for equal population sizes. Second, the probability of success in reaching a good fitness value 
in a typical run is higher in MGA than in GA. Finally, the time needed to reach the optimum using the same 
population size is lower in MGA (Marin and Sole, 1999). This method has been applied successfully to water 
resources optimization problems that can be formulated in terms of an optimization function even if the 
function is highly multimodal or highly multidimensional (Chen et al., 2007), . 
 
3.5.2 Objective Function 
The objective function of optimization model can be written as: 
∑ + 2321Minimize μμ ……………………………………………………….(7) 
subject to: 
The in-reservoir TP concentration achieves the expected water quality which is considered as two 
scenarios: the first scenario is set to be 20 (μg/L) and the second scenario is set to be 30 (μg/L). 
Here u1 is the phosphorus reduction rate of the tributary Diyu Creek; and u3 is the phosphorus reduction 
rate of the main flow Peishih Creek. The range of the two phosphorus reduction rates is set to the same 
interval 0–1. Applying real-coded GA to the optimization problems, chromosomes may be generated that fail 
to meet constraints. Therefore, each generated chromosome must be checked against such constraints.  
The optimum values of the phosphorus reduction rate of the two sources, u1 and u3, obtained by using the 
MGA for scenario 1 to control Feitsui Reservoir water quality are presented in Fig.5. The average phosphorus 
reduction rate (u1) of scenario 1 (TP in reservoir under 20 (μg/L) is 0.024(2.4%) for the tributary Diyu Creek; 
and average u3=0.298 (29.8%) for the main flow Peishih Creek. It indicates that the reduction rate of main flow 
is larger than that of the tributary at most time periods. In the scenario 2, the optimum values of u1 and u3 are 
also presented in Fig.5. Based on the calculation, the average u1 and u3 are equals to 0.016 (1.6%) and 0.022 
(2.2%), respectively. The result shows that these two reduction rates are close to each other for scenario 2 (TP 
in reservoir under 30 (μg/L). Fig. 6 reveals the TP concentration in Feitsui Reservoir through reducing the 
phosphorus loads from the watershed for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, the average reduction rate 
of TP in reservoir equals 81% for scenario 1; while it reaches 95% for scenario 2.
