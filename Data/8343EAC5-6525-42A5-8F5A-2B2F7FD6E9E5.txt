英 文 摘 要 ： The transactions records first were transformed into 
the format of RFM model. Later, SOM and K-means 
method are used to classify all of the customers into 
appropriate clusters. By summarizing the information 
regarding R, F, M, demographic information, and the 
like for each cluster, valuable customers based on R, 
F, and M can be easily identified. In addition, the 
grand average R, F, and M values of all clusters and 
the average R, F, and M values for each cluster were 
computed such that each R/F/M value in each cluster 
were compared with the grand average R/F/M value. If 
each R/F/M value in each cluster is greater than the 
respective grand average, a symbol of  is added, 
and vice versa. Therefore, the major targeted 
customers would be ’R F M ’  and then ’R F
 M ’  and ’R F M ’ . 
The original transactions data then were further 
transformed into the figures of 1-5, and then we 
performed RFM model, used SOM and K-means for 
customer segmentations. Classification and regression 
tree (CART) was used where the output was set to be 
the monetary. The input variables included such as 
gender, zip code, frequency, and so on, to establish 
a CART model for forecasting. 
The transactions records were transformed into the 
format of LRFM model. By the same token, sixteen

Targeted customers 
 
2. Introduction and Research Objectives 
RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model is a behavior-based model that can be used to 
analyze the behavior of a customer and then make predictions based on the behavior in the database. 
By adopting RFM model, decision makers can effectively identify valuable customers and then 
develop effective marketing strategies to meet customers’ needs. With a wide variety of applications, it 
is worth reviewing the definitions of RFM model and its applications in various areas. In addition, 
RFM model has been further extended by taking variable(s) into consideration. Since some researchers 
identify the deficiencies of RFM model in evaluating the length of customer relationship, length (L) 
has been added into the original RFM model to become LRFM (Length, Recency, Frequency, and 
Monetary) model. The combinations would be increased from 8 (RFM model) to 16 (LRFM model). 
Moreover, different types of customers can be classified in accordance with the performance of L, R, F, 
and M variables. Therefore, it would be of interest to discuss the definitions of LRFM model and its 
applications as well. More importantly, the difference between RFM model and LRFM model should 
be further investigated to show the advantage of adding length in the original RFM model. 
 
3. Literature Review 
RFM model is the most frequently adopted segmentation technique, including three measures - 
recency, frequency, and monetary which are combined into a three-digit RFM cell code, covering five 
equal quintile (20 percent group). The process to quantify R, F, and M variables is as follows. First, 
sort the database by each dimension of RFM and then divide the customer list into five equal segments. 
The method is known as exactly equal size. Different RFM quintile has different response rates. For 
recency, sort customers by purchase dates. Recency is commonly defined by the number of periods 
since the last purchase, which measures the interval between the most recent transaction time and the 
analyzing time (i.e., days or months). The lower the number of days, the higher the score of recency. A 
customer having a high score of recency implies that he or she is more likely to make a repeat 
purchase. The top 20 percent segment is coded as 5. The next 20 percent segment is assigned as a code 
4 and so forth. Finally, the recency for each customer in the database is denoted by a number from 5 to 
1. 
For frequency, the database is sorted by purchase frequency (the number of purchases) made in a 
certain time period. The definition of frequency is often simplified to consider two states, including 
single and repeated purchases. The top quintile is assigned as a value of 5 and the others are given the 
values of 4, 3, 2, and 1. Higher frequency score indicates greater customer loyalty. A customer having 
 5 
is very valuable in predicting response and can boost a company’s profits in a short term. Third, it is 
very effective to model with RFM variables as the purchase behavior can be summarized by using a 
very small number of variables. Fourth, RFM variables are gathered via an internal databases 
containing customer-specific information regarding the transaction history and are not obtained 
through the aggregate level information in the demographic databases. Hence, RFM is more 
meaningful for targeting particular customers. Fifth, RFM is a long-familiar method to measure the 
strength of customer relationship as RFM can effectively identify valuable customers. 
One major drawback of RFM model is that RFM model cannot segment which customers have 
long-term or short-term relationship with the company. The customer loyalty depends on the 
relationship between a firm and customers, revealing that the key of customer loyalty is built from a 
long customer relationship management. The definition of length from the database is to define the 
length (i.e., days, months, or years) between the first purchase and the last purchase. Therefore, the 
longer “L” a customer has, the more behavioral loyalty the customer shows when the other three 
variables are fixed. The long-term or short-term relationship can be classified based on “L” variable. 
Data mining techniques have been widely applied to different domains. As the transactions of an 
organization becomes much larger in size, data mining techniques, particularly the clustering technique, 
can be used to divide all customers into appropriate number of clusters based on some similarities in 
these customers. Clustering technique is used to identify a set of groups that both minimize 
within-group variation and maximize between-group variation according to a distance or dissimilarity 
function. 
SOM is a popular unsupervised neural network methodology to clustering for problem solving 
involving tasks such as clustering, visualization and abstraction and market screening. Compared to 
traditional clustering techniques such as the K-means algorithm, SOM has the following advantages. 
SOM network is a competitive and cooperative neural networks, the theory of which is motivated via 
observing the operation of the brain. 
SOM is trained by an unsupervised competitive learning algorithm and can automatically detect 
strong features in large data sets. While SOM maximizes the degree of similarity of patterns within a 
cluster and minimize the similarity of patterns belonging to different clusters, it can produce 
two-dimensional arrangement of neurons from the multi-dimensional space. SOM network includes an 
input layer and an output layer. Originally, SOM’s patterns in a high-dimensional input space are very 
complicated.  After SOM maps similar input vectors onto similar output units on a two-dimensional 
map, its structure on a projected graphical map display becomes more transparent and more 
understandable. Hence, SOM provides the recognizable technique of the inherent relation between the 
input and output. More importantly, unlike the supervised methods, this unsupervised method can be 
applied to cluster data without prior knowing the class memberships of the input data. 
K-means method belonging to one of non-hierarchical methods is a very popular approach for 
classification due to its simplicity of implementation and fast execution. This approach has been 
widely applied to various areas, such as market segmentation, pattern recognition, information 
 7 
structure will be provided. If both training and testing data sets show high accuracy in forecasting 
outcomes, customers’ behaviors can be analyzed in terms of the input variables. 
Third, use the original data set for cluster based on LRFM model. Apply both SOM and K-means 
method to determine the number of clusters. Summarize the demographic information such as gender, 
age groups, average L, R, F, and M values, and the like. With the above information, marketing 
strategies can be designed to meet different types of customers’ needs. 
Fourth, transform the original data set into figures 1-5 based on LRFM model. Use CART to 
identify critically important variables, to summarize the rules, and to generate tree-type structure. If 
both training and testing data sets show high accuracy in forecasting outcomes, customers’ behaviors 
can be analyzed in terms of the input variables. 
Fifth, evaluate the difference between RFM model and LRFM model in terms of cluster and 
CART results. 
 
5. Results and Discussions 
In order to understand RFM model thoroughly, we first wrote a review journal article and a 
review conference paper (Ref. 3 and 11) to summarize the history of RFM model, the definition of 
RFM model, applications of RFM model, advantages of RFM model, and disadvantages of RFM 
model. Later, we use RFM model along with SOM and K-means method for market segmentation in a 
hair industry (Ref. 4 and 10) and a pediatric dental clinic (Ref. 9). After that, we further apply LRFM 
model along with clustering techniques for market segmentation in a pediatric dental clinic (Ref. 1 and 
12), an outfitter (Ref. 2), and a hair industry (Ref. 6). We also have papers published by applying 
classification and regression tree in a pediatric dental clinic (Ref. 7 and 8) to estimate patients’ 
behaviors. However, the accuracy is not as good as we expected because the data were skewed. The 
forecasted model can only provide good estimates in some categories rather than all of the categories. 
In order to explore data mining as broad as possible, one conference paper (Ref. 5) uses Bayesian 
network along with LRFM model in a pediatric dental clinic. 
During these two years, four international conferences outside Taiwan has been attained, 
including The Second POMS-HK International Conference, The 2011 International Conference on 
Asia Pacific Business Innovation & Technology Management, International Proceedings of Economic 
Development and Research - Innovation, Management and Service, and The International Conference

ABSTRACT 
An LRFM (Length, Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model is applied in a children’s dental clinic to 
segment dental patients. Twelve clusters are recommended by self-organizing maps for the overall 2258 
patients. The average values of LRF are computed for each cluster and the overall patients, excluding 
monetary covered by the National Health Insurance program. The variable for each cluster greater than the 
overall average will be identified. The results show that two clusters have the above average LRF values (463 
patients) which can be viewed as loyal patients; while four clusters (618 patients) have no any variable above 
the average.

1. Introduction 
Capon (1982), Rutsohn and Ibrahim (2000), and Wang et al. (1996) concluded that developing marketing 
strategies has become an essential issue for medical care industry, particularly for dental care. In Taiwan, with 
the introduction of the new total payment rule of National Health Insurance (NHI) program executed by 
Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwanese government since March 1995, the medical care industry is 
getting more and more competitive (Lee et al., 2008; Shieh et al., 2010). This is particularly true for Taiwan’s 
dental services. In addition, with the cost-containment mechanism and global budgeting systems for dental 
care in Taiwan, dental care is covered as part of the benefit package in NHI program. Thus, a dentist’s income 
is limited when serving a dental cares covered by NHI program as NHI program will cover most of cost 
except for the co-payment and registration fee per visit (Lee and Shih, 2009). This reveals the importance for 
Taiwanese dentists to identify profitable customers and to retain important customers so as to market dental 
services. 
Segmentation technique is often used to discover profitable quotient. RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) 
model is the most frequently adopted segmentation technique and has a long history in the application of 
direct marketing. Decision makers can effectively identify valuable customers and then develop effective 
marketing strategy in accordance with the results provided by RFM model (Cheng and Chen, 2009). Recent 
paper suggests that the predictability of RFM models can be improved by adding additional variables when 
predicting customer behaviors (Hosseini et al., 2010; Yeh et al., 2008). Based on Reinartz and Kumar (2000), 
limited to the use of RFM model, firms cannot effectively distinguish between the short-life and long-life 
customers. In light to the above, this paper extends RFM model to LRFM model by adding an additional 
variable – length (L) in a children’s dental clinic in Taiwan to effectively identify valuable customers for 
dental services marketing.

by purchase dates by descending order. The top segment is given a value of 5 and the others are descendingly 
assigned of 4, 3, 2 and 1. For frequency and monetary, to sort customer visiting frequency data and the 
customer data related to the amount of the money spent in descending order, respectively. The top 20% is also 
assigned the value of 5.  The value of 4 is also given to the next 20% and so on (Hughes, 1996; Kahan, 1998; 
Tsai and Chiu, 2004). 
 
Some literature has summarized the need to extend RFM model by adding variables (Hosseini et al., 2010; 
Yeh et al., 2008). Reinartz and Kumar (2000), in particular, stated that RFM model cannot segment which 
customers have long-term or short-term relationship with the company. The customer loyalty depends on the 
relationship between a firm and customers (Chow and Holden, 1997), revealing that the key of customer 
loyalty is built from a long customer relationship management (Chang and Tsay, 2004). In this regard, RFM 
model is extended as LRFM model by taking length (L) into account in this study. 
 
3. Case Study 
The purpose of this case study is to identify profitable customers in a children’s dental clinic in Taiwan. This 
dental clinic begins its operation since September 17, 1995. By definition, the patients must be less than 18 
years old to be classified as children. When the patients become 18 years old, they must go to an adult dental 
clinic instead. In order to identify most profitable patients, it is necessary to consider the “age factor” in this 
children’s dental clinic. Thus, the time period taken in this study to measure the frequency becomes essential. 
This study collects the data set with 2,258 patients who visited this clinic from January 1, 2008 to July 15, 
2010. 
 
The profile for each patient consists of the membership number, gender, birth date, the days from the first visit 
date to the last visit date, the last visit date, and visit frequency. Monetary value for each patient is excluded in 
the profile as the majority of a dentist’s income is from the co-payment and registration fee per visit by NHI 
program in Taiwan (Lee and Shih, 2009) and thus is proposed to be fixed. The notations in some demographic 
information are depicted below. Gender equals 1 if the patient is the male and 0 if the patient is the female. 
The birth date is classified into four age groups. The age of 5 and below is coded as 1, the age of 6-10 is 
coded as 2, the age of 11-15 is coded as 3 and the age of 16 and above is coded as 4. The definition of LRFM 
model is reported in Table 1. 
 
Table 1.  The definitions of LRFM model 
Variables Definitions  
Length (L) refers to the number of days from the first visit date to the last visit date since September 
17, 1995 
Recency (R) refers to the number of days since the last visit from January 1, 2008 to July 15, 2010 
Frequency (F) refers to the number of visit in a specified time period (January 1, 2008 to July 15, 2010) 
Monetary (M)* refers to the co-payment and registration fee per visit (*proposed to be fixed) 
 
The descriptive statistics for L, R, and F are presented in Table 2. For the length, if the first and the last visit 
dates are identical, the length is coded as 1. In this study, the maximum and minimum values of lengths in 
 9 
resource is limited. 
 
The rest eight clusters can be analyzed as follows. For Cluster 11, only the average of recency is above the 
total average. Besides, the average length and frequency is low.  In this regard, the patients of Cluster 11 are 
likely to be new customers. Pertaining to the marketing strategies for customers in Cluster 11, the dental clinic 
should enhance customer relationship management to keep in touch with the patients and find ways to meet 
their demand by attracting them to visit more often. For example, special attention and treatment is 
particularly vital to children patients when receiving dental care (Barnes and Mowatt, 1986). 
 
For Clusters 3 and 9, the average values of recency and frequency are above the total average values of R and 
F. The only difference between the patients for Cluster 11 and the patients for Clusters 3 and 9 is that the latter 
groups visited the dental clinic more often. The dental clinic should keep frequent contracts with the patients 
of Clusters 3 and 9. For instance, the dental clinic might consider quipping its waiting room with children’s 
accessories or minimize their waiting time for the treatment so as to develop closer and longer relationships 
with them. 
 
Among the rest five clusters, Clusters 1, 5, and 10 would be the core customers as they have a close 
relationship with the dental clinic by visiting recently and visiting frequently. They are loyal both in attitude 
and behavior in the dental clinic. Loyal customers are profitable as they would contribute positively to the 
success of their dental care experience. Therefore, the dental clinic should focus on the patients of these three 
clusters. 
 
The averages of L and R for Clusters 6 and 8 are above the total averages whereas the averages of F for both 
clusters are low. This shows that the customers in both clusters are likely to be loyal customers as they keep 
stable relationship with the dental clinic by visiting recently though their visit frequency is still low. Under 
such circumstance, the dental clinic can provide some particular medical promotions or discounts to boost 
their willingness to visit. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Marketing expertise plays a vital role of dental clinics in remaining viable in the dental market (Lee and Shih, 
2009). Customers believe dental advertising can be done according to each unique taste and dentists should 
market their services (Clow et al., 2007). A successful marketer, namely dentist, must identify the needs of 
customers in different segments (Capon, 1982). This paper applies LRFM model based on RFM model by 
adding the length parameter and uses self-organizing maps to segment patients and target important patients in 
a children’s dental clinic in Taiwan. Twelve clusters are formed by SOM technique. 
 
The patients of Clusters 1, 5 and 10 would be the most important patients for the clinic. They would be 
regarded as the highest loyal customers in the clinic, revealing the necessary for the dental clinic to 
committing more resources to the patients of the three clusters. The patients of Clusters 6 and 8 are also likely 
to be loyal customers.  In order to increase the number of the visit of the patients, the dental clinic can 
provide better after-medical care activities and small gifts with the provision of the medical services. The

Information technology has been constantly improved to help firms create a well-managed customer 
database [5]. RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model is employed to measure the values of 
customers for firms by examining customer past and existing purchasing behaviors and make predictions on 
customer future behavior. RFM model involves three variables. Recency measures the latest purchase amount. 
Frequency measures the total number of purchases during a particular period. Monetary measures total 
spending monetary value during a particular period. Firms adopt RFM model to sort individuals into different 
customer groups. RFM model can help decision makers understand customer needs and adjust their marketing 
strategies under limited resources [6-9]. 
 
 
II.  THE DEFINITION AND THE SCORING SCHEME OF RFM MODEL 
 
The three measures namely recency, frequency, and monetary of RFM model have been widely applied in 
marketing studies and are often used to segment customers. RFM model can be transformed into a three-digit 
RFM cell code, including five equal segments (20 percent group). Next, this paper illustrates how to quantify 
customer behavior by applying RFM model. In the beginning, the database is sorted by each RFM variable. 
Later, customers are divided into five equal quintiles and each has equal size. Recency is generally defined as 
the number of periods since the last purchase, which can be measured by days, months or even years. When 
the number of periods is lower, the score of recency is higher. In this case, customers have higher response 
rate and have higher retention possibility. The top 20 percent quintile is assigned as a code 5. The next other 
20 percent quintiles are coded as 4, 3, 2 and 1 [10-12]. 
Frequency identifies the purchase frequency in a particular time. The top segment is coded as 5 and the 
others are assigned the values of 4 and so forth. The higher the frequency score, the higher customer loyalty. 
Monetary measures the total amount of monetary spent during a particular time. Finally, all customers are 
depicted by 555, 554, 553, …, 111. This creates 125 RFM cells [2, 13-15]. The above RFM scoring method 
proposed by Miglautsch [15] is called customer quintile method. 
Another scoring method proposed by John Wirth (The founder of Woodworker’s Supply of New Mexico) 
is called behavior quintile scoring method, sorting customers according to their behavior. The scoring method 
of recency includes five intervals: 0-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-12 months, 13-24 months and 25+ months 
(coded as 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively). As for frequency, Miglautsch [15] combined behavior quintile 
scoring method and the mean scoring method proposed by Ted Miglautsch (V. P. Development, Miglautsch 
Marketing, Inc.). The score of frequency is defined that the single purchasers are assigned as a score of 1. 
Then, average the remaining frequency values to determine the mean. Once a customer’s total frequency 
value is lower than the mean, a score of 2 is given to this customer. The process may be repeated more than 
two times. Pertaining to monetary, five segments are still created and each has equal amounts of sales. 
Other studies suggest that the possible combinations of RFM can be obtained by assigning ↓ or ↑ based on 
the average R (F, M) value of a cluster being less than or greater than the overall average R (F, M) value. This 
leads to the creation of 8 segments. The composite value of RFM is obtained via multiplying normalized RFM 
values of each customer and the weight of RFM variables [6-7, 16]. 
Two ways are proposed to create a single RFM value when discussing the weighting method of RFM 
  21
(i.e., the purchased items and associated monetary expenses from transactional customer histories). Through 
segmentation, a designated RFM model is used to analyze the relative profitability for each customer cluster, 
which provides more marketing opportunities and helps marketers adjust their marketing strategies. 
Chan [25] introduced a technique to combine customer targeting and customer segmentation for campaign 
strategies adopting RFM to identify customer behavior and a CLV model to evaluate proposed segmented 
customers by investigating Nissan automobile retailer. The results indicated that the novel methodology 
achieves better results in targeting valuable customers than random selection. Lumsden et al. [8] used RFM 
model to discriminate customer value based on pre-purchase motivations of membership initiation in and 
all-inclusive travel vacation club. 
Jonker et al. [9] used a decision support system to determine mailing frequency for active customers such 
that direct mailers with tools can define preferred response behavior and provide advices on the mailing 
strategy that can motivate customers towards this preferred response behavior. The system examines the 
mailing pattern of customers via RFM model and offers mailing policies for multiple time periods. Colombo 
and Jiang [26] presented a simple stochastic RFM model to target customers in the firm’s database through 
only considering recency and frequency to predict response rate and predicting an expected contribution with 
the combination of the response rate and monetary value. Hsieh [4] introduced an integrated data mining and 
behavioral scoring model to manage existing credit card customers in a bank through a self-organizing maps 
neural network to predict profitable groups of customers according to repayment behavior and RFM 
behavioral scoring predictors. The findings reveal that the values of RFM and repayment behavior are 
behavioral scoring predictors influencing customer segmentation. 
Ha and Park [23] used data mining techniques to boost the amount of sales of the target duty-free shop 
according to RFM data extracted from the customer information of the data mart via the enterprise Intranet. 
Cheng and Chen [27] proposed a procedure that joins RFM attributes and K-means algorithm into rough sets 
theory in order to improve classification accuracy and extract classification rules for attaining an excellent 
CRM for enterprises. RFM model is adopted to analyze customer consuming behavior to segment different 
groups of customers. 
RFM model has been used to calculate CLV [6, 16]. Liu and Shih [6] introduced a new product 
recommendation method that combined group decision-making and data mining methods by applying AHP, 
clustering, and association rule mining techniques. In addition, they used RFM to evaluate CLV and compare 
the following four methods, including weighted-RFM method, non-weighted RFM method, the non-clustering 
method, and the typical collaborative filtering (CF) method.  Weighted-RFM method (non-weighted RFM 
method) takes (does not take) the relative importance of RFM dimensions into account via AHP. The results 
revealed that the novel method yields better recommendations based on higher quality. 
Li et al. [21] combined RFM and a modified Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measures to calculate 
the influential power of real online users by their reviews. They analyzed the comments written by each 
reviewer via text-mining techniques, which were quantified by a modified PMI measure. Meanwhile, they 
measured the RFM scores of the reviewers by quantifying the reviewing recency and frequency of the authors. 
Then, they combined the PMI- and RFM-based scores so as to determine whether a reviewer has the infective 
ability and is valuable in word-of-mouth marketing. The results indicated that the novel methodology can 
accurately identify which reviewers should be selected to become the influential nodes. 
  23
WRFM-based method) or the preference-based collaborative filtering (CF) method in enhancing the quality of 
recommendations of products. Their results showed that the propsed hybrid methods outperformed than the 
other two methods. 
 
VI.  SUMMARY 
 
Traditionally, RFM model is often adopted in marketing area to examine customer behavior, which 
facilitates firms to make effective marketing strategies by focusing on highly valuable customers. 
Nowadays,   the application of RFM model has been extended to other practical areas. By reviewing 
the literature on the application of RFM model, this paper attempts to provide more comprehensive 
understanding on RFM to researchers and decision makers. First, this paper examines how RFM is 
defined in the literature dealing with different practical areas, including marketing, information 
technology and financial industry, etc. Second, this paper briefly introduces the scoring scheme of RFM 
and depicts the application of RFM model. Finally, this paper discusses the strength and the weakness of 
RFM model as well as comparative advantages and disadvantages of RFM and other models. 
This paper provides a rigorous literature review on RFM model. This makes important contributions 
to both researchers and decision makers. Specifically, researchers can get vital insights into how RFM 
model is applied and may possibly extend RFM model to more practical areas. In addition, researchers 
may develop more novel methodology by refining RFM model. This facilitates to enhance the 
predictability of RFM model when calculating the possible customer response rate and identifying 
valuable customers. For decision makers, RFM model helps them make accurate decisions and solve 
problems. Marketers can identify loyal customers and develop effective strategy for profit organizations, 
non-profit organizations, and government agencies. Decision makers can use RFM model to segment 
customers [10-11], estimate the response probability for each offer type [20], observe customer behavior 
[34], calculate customer value and customer lifetime value [6, 16], and evaluate on-line reviewers [21]. 
In sum, researchers and decision makers would be benefit from understanding how RFM model is 
applied and its comparative advantages. In doing so, more research on examining the application of RFM 
model can be expected and effective strategies to solve a wide variety of the problems can be developed 
as well.

In this case study, the transactions data in a pediatric dental clinic in Taiwan were used. The data were first 
transformed into LRFM (Length, Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) format as well as gender and age were 
classified into two and four clusters, respectively, and then analyzed by classification and regression tree 
(CART) to classify each patient into appropriate group with rules and to predict the frequency of a particular 
patient based on these transactions data. 
2. Literature Review 
2.1. LRFM model 
RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model is a behavior-based model to analyze the behavior of a 
customer and then make predictions based on the behavior in the database (Hughes, 1996; Yeh et al., 2009). 
Specifically, recency represents the length of a time period since the last purchase; frequency denotes the 
number of purchase within a specified time period; and monetary means the amount of money spent in this 
specified time period (Wang, 2010). The traditional approach to quantify customer behavior based on RFM 
model is as follows. First, sort the database by each dimension of RFM and then divide the customer list into 
five equal segments. The top 20% segment is coded as 5. The next 20% segment is assigned as a code 4 and 
so forth (Hughes, 1996; Kahan, 1998; Tsai and Chiu, 2004). Therefore, all customers can be presented by 555, 
554, 553, …, 111 with possible 125 (5×5×5) RFM cells. 
Chang and Tsay (2004) added length into original RFM model to become LRFM (Length, Recency, 
Frequency, and Monetary) model since length measures the time period between the first visit and the last 
visit of a particular customer. Reinartz amd Kumar (2000) stated that RFM model cannot segment which 
customers have long-term or short-term relationship with the company. With the introduction of length, the 
relationship between the customer and the company can be determined from numerical viewpoint. In order to 
divide the customer into five equal segments, prioritize the length values by descending order and then select 
the top 20% values as the number of 5. The next 20% values can be assigned as a value of 4 and so forth. 
Therefore, the numerical length values can be transformed into 5 to 1. 
RFM models have been widely applied to a wide variety of areas, such as nonprofits, financial organizations 
(Hsieh, 2004; Sohrabi and Khanlari, 2007), government agencies (King, 2007), on-line industry (Li et al., 
2010), telecommunication industry (Li et al., 2008), travel industry (Ha and Park, 1998; Lumsden et al., 2008) 
and marketing industry (Spring et al., 1999; Jonker et al., 2006). In addition, RFM model can be used to 
segment customers, calculate customer value and customer lifetime value (CLV), observe customer behavior, 
estimate the response probability for each offer type and evaluate on-line reviewers (Wei et al., 2010). 
2.2. Classification and regression tree 
Solomon et al. (2006) summarized that the decision tree model is a powerful and popular tool to classify and 
predict data patterns since rules are generated more straightforward and relatively easy to be interpreted. In 
addition, from business management viewpoint, decision trees can generate a set of rules from the classified 
data set which can be applied to the unclassified data set and predict the outcomes by aiding the future 
decision-making process (Lee and Siau, 2001). Classification and regression tree (CART) is one of the most 
commonly seen algorithms in decision tree models (Solomon et al., 2006; Rokach et al., 2007). 
Classification and regression tree is one of the decision tree algorithms for classification by constructing a 
  35
 
In order to transform the LRFM data into categorical data for CART, L, R, and F values were divided into five 
equal segments with each segment containing 20% of the entire data for each variable. The specific 
information is summarized in Table 2. Since M is proposed to be fixed, the target for CART was chosen to be 
the frequency. The higher value the frequency, the much money the dental clinic would make under NHI 
program. The input variables of CART included gender, age, L, and R. Clementine 12.0 was used to perform 
CART with “expert” mode by using the default values for all parameters. The maximum surrogates and 
minimum change in impurity were set to 5 and 0.0001, respectively. The impurity measure for categorical 
targets was Gini. The stopping criteria were based on the percentage with minimum records in parents branch 
(%) of two and minimum records in child branch (%) of one. Furthermore, training partition size and testing 
partition size were set to 55 and 45 percents, respectively. 
Table 2: The transformed data with codes for classification and regression tree analysis.

4. Results 
The tree depth was six, and the variable importance values of gender, age, L, and R were 0.006, 0.034, 0.003, 
and 0.957, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the model, stated in Table 3, was well over 58% for both 
training and testing data sets. To further examine the coincidence matrix as shown in Table 4, where row 
shows actual category while column makes the prediction of the category, the second, third, and fourth 
categories of frequency were less than 50%. Only the first and fifth categories of frequency could be 
accurately predicted for both training and testing data sets.

1. Introduction 
With increasing living standards and the sustainable changing patterns of people’s lives, people, 
particularly for the women, spend more on improving their beauty so as to fulfill successfully their roles in 
various socioeconomic categories. Kéïta et al. (2005) pointed out that hairdressing is a common way for 
people to present a well-groomed face to the world, including haircuts, hairstyles, hair perming, hair color, 
hair care, and scalp massages (Gerson, 1999). At present in Taiwan, the hairdressing industry is one of the 
popular service industries for the women when choosing their occupations. Hairdressers must receive the 
basic hairdressing certificate and can earn higher wage than ever before. In contrast to the traditional values 
for the hairdressing industry, the hairdressing industry is not a low-skilled and low-waged industry anymore. 
The hairdressing industry has become a highly competitive industry in developed and developing 
economies, showing that the hairdressing industry has significant impact on the economy in developed and 
developing countries (Picot-Lemasson et al., 2001; Brookes & Smith, 2009). There is no exception to Taiwan, 
particularly a rapid growing aging population. People with higher age demand more frequently to change their 
hair styles and increase more services to disguise their graying hair. Thus, the importance of the hairdressing 
industry in Taiwan is increasingly growing. Wang (2010) stated that Taiwanese hairdressing industry has the 
urgent need to identify profitable customers and retain loss customers so as to effectively market the services. 
Prior literature rarely investigates how the customer relationship management (CRM) is implemented in 
the hairdressing industry and thus there is little known about the marketing strategies of the hairdressing 
industry. Investigating customer behavior facilitates hair salons to make marketing strategies according to 
particular demand of customers for the services (Brown & Beale, 2008). Under such circumstance, it is vital 
to provide examinations on how hair salons target valuable customers and make marketing strategies for 
different types of customers by observing customer behaviors to segment customers. For example, by 
observing customer behaviors, when finding that particular customers visiting a certain hair salon more 
frequently and more recently whereas spending less than others would expect more to cope with their dry hair, 
the hair salon can make particular marketing strategies for the customers such as providing the newest 
promotional activities and recommending preferential products that can effectively improve their hair health 
so as to increase their consumption in the hair salon. 
Nowadays, the ability to generate useful information from data is critically important for the 
management. By applying data mining (DM) techniques, the hidden and unknown customer information can 
be obtained and effective CRM strategies can be made (Lee & Siau, 2001; Ranjan & Bhatnagar, 2011). DM 
techniques help management to systematically analyze customer profiles by segmenting customers and 
targeting valuable customers. When service providers understand customer preference, they can develop 
adequate marketing strategies for customers and thus can meet their demand, enhance their satisfaction for the 
services, and increase their willingness to purchase (Fu et al., 2011; Kim, 2011). 
This paper adopts DM techniques, combining the self-organizing map (SOM) and K-means methods 
along with the application of RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) model, to examine a hair salon in 
Taiwan to effectively identify its valuable customers and develop its marketing strategies. RFM model has 
been extensively applied in direct marketing to systematically examine existing customer data to analyze their 
consumption habits, which benefits marketers to identify profitable customers in an effective way and develop 
adequate marketing strategies and helps marketers to seek ways to retain lost customers (Wei et al., 2010).

time length since the most recent purchase; frequency means the number of purchases during the same time 
period; and monetary refers to the total amount of money spent on all purchases. In this study, we adopt this 
approach for RFM model. 
 
3. Case Study 
The transaction data were from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2008, namely the first quarter of 2008, with 
9,620 transactions by 789 customers from a particular professional hair salon in Taiwan. Each transaction 
includes the customer’s membership number, purchase date, purchase item, product category, item price, item 
quantity purchased, and total purchase amount of money. In this study, recency is defined as the most recent 
purchase in the database. That is, recency measures the number of days since the last purchase from January 1, 
2008 to March 31, 2008. Specifically, January 1, 2008 is given by a number of one, January 2, 2008 is 
assigned by a number of two, and March 31, 2008 has the value of 91. To transform the data set into 
frequency, count the number of purchase for a particular customer in the first quarter of 2008. Finally, 
monetary is measured by computing the total amount spent in this quarter for a particular customer. 
The descriptive statistics regarding the maximum, minimum and average values of recency, frequency, 
and monetary values are summarized in Table 1. The maximum and minimum recency values are 91 and 1, 
respectively. For the frequency, the maximum and minimum values are calculated to be 28 and 1, respectively. 
The maximum and minimum monetary values are calculated to be $102,776 and $125 (calculated in New 
Taiwan Dollars), respectively. 
 
Table 1 The descriptive statistics of recency, frequency and monetary 
 Maximum Minimum Average Standard deviation 
Recency 91 1 61.7 25.2 
Frequency 28 1 3.2 2.8   
Monetary 102,776 125 5,225.8 7,818.3  
 
Eleven clusters are recommended by SOM. Later, the number of clusters of K-means method is set to 
eleven. Table 2 summarizes the sample size, average recency (R), average frequency (F), average monetary 
(M), and the symbol of R, F, and M above the average. By observing Table 2, if the average R (F/M) value of 
a cluster exceeds the total average R (F/M) value, then an upward arrow ↑ is shown; otherwise, a downward 
arrow ↓ is shown. Clusters 1, 4, 10, and 11 have R, F, and M values greater than the average R, F, and M 
values (R↑F↑M↑), representing the customers in these clusters have high contribution to this hair salon, 
defining as loyal customers. For this type of customers, regularly sending latest catalogs, understanding their 
shopping habits and their needs through the transactions and actively using mobile phone text messages to 
provide suitable information and limited time offer for new products are the means to increase their loyalty.
