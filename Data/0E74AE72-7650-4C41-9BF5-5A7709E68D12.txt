The drive for system-in-package (SiP) designs has led to a significant increase in 
function densities and reduction in interconnect dimensions at package level. While the 
smaller package-level interconnect dimensions are still significantly larger than the die-level 
feature sizes, they present significant challenges in both fabrication process and component 
reliability due to the large amount of organic materials used for packaging. One of the 
primary root causes for process yield loss (such as excessive die position shifting and 
package warpage, etc.) and reliability failures is associated to the interaction between 
chemical reaction and mechanical response during various process steps. In order to 
overcome these difficulties, a coupled chemical-thermo-mechanical model for the stress and 
warpage evolutions during various process steps is needed such that the ultimate goal of 
process and reliability optimization during the design phase can be realized. 
In this research a comprehensive model for the constitutive behavior of epoxy molding 
compound is developed and applied for simulating deformation and stress during packaging 
processes. The effect of curing process on the warpage of encapsulated electronic package is 
considered by using a coupled chemical-thermo-mechanical modeling methodology. A 
cure-dependent constitutive model that consists of a cure kinetics model, a curing and 
chemical aging induced shrinkage model and a degree of cure-dependent viscoelastic 
relaxation model was implemented in a numerical finite element model for warpage 
simulation. Effects of polymerization conversion and chemical aging on the warpage 
evolution of a bimaterial dummy package after molding and during the post-mold curing 
(PMC) process were investigated by using the proposed modeling methodology. Shadow 
Moiré warpage analyses were also performed to validate the numerical results. It was found 
from the warpage analyses that the chemical aging, while contributing little to the overall 
crosslinking during PMC, has a significant effect on package warpage. 
The proposed coupled chemical-thermo-mechanical modeling methodology can be 
extended to consider other organic package constituents such as die-attach adhesive, underfill 
and substrate, and can be served as the framework to enable simulation-based process 
optimization for warpage or stress reduction in advanced electronic packages containing 
organic packaging materials. Advantage of this approach is that it would provide a 
physics-based, quantitative assessment on the effects of process time- and temperature- 
profiles on warpage and stress in the package, as opposed to exhaustive 
design-of-experiments data collection and analysis for warpage reduction. In addition, 
evaluation of new package designs using this methodology can be performed at the beginning

三、報告內容 
3.1  Introduction 
The tendency of thermosetting polymers to expand or contract more significantly than 
other package constituents during processing is widely recognized as a critical issue for 
electronic packages: from the assembly yield perspective, the deviation of the package from a 
planar state, or warpage, as a result of the mismatch in volume changes would increase the 
difficulty in achieving good interconnection to circuit board for surface mount area array 
packages; from the reliability perspective, the associated residual stress would accelerate 
defect growth and product failure. Polymeric packaging materials, such as epoxy molding 
compound (EMC), underfill, and substrates undergo significant volume changes during 
assembly processes because of their high coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) and the 
chemical shrinkage occurring at high temperatures. 
With the higher reflow temperatures associated with Pb-free assembly processes, packages 
are more prone to the warpage and stress issues related to the mismatch in package material 
expansion or contraction. In addition to that, the technology trend of system integration at 
package level and finer package-to-circuit-board-interconnect pitch are placing more 
tightened specifications on both coplanarity and in-plane alignment accuracy. For example, in 
state-of-the-art embedded wafer level packaging process, two of the key challenges are the 
silicon die location shift and warpage of the reconfigured wafer, both of which are related to 
the shrinkage of the molding compound used for encapsulating the reconfigured wafer [1]. In 
order to meet the more stringent requirements for deformation and warpage during package 
fabrication and board mounting processes, it is important to identify the mechanisms of 
residual deformation and stress generations, and incorporate these effects into the prediction 
model of warpage for optimizing the packaging processes. 
The subject of package warpage and stress resulted from CTE mismatch has been 
considered extensively, and quantitative models for packages under either assembly reflow or 
temperature cycling conditions were developed by many researchers, e. g., [2, 3]. On the other 
hand, the effect of polymer chemical shrinkage on package warpage and stress was less 
discussed. Chemical shrinkage of polymer is related to the crosslinking of the molecular 
chains. As the crosslinking density increases, the polymer experiences a reduction in free 
volume, an increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg), and changes in volume and 
mechanical behavior.  
For typical polymeric packaging materials such as EMC and underfills, the 
catalyst-assisted crosslinking taking place during the packaging processes may be separated 
into two regimes: the polymerization conversion and the chemical aging. The polymerization 
conversion regime corresponds to the majority of the crosslinking reaction during which a 
considerable amount of heat is generated from the reaction. Level of the polymerization

In the simulation, the dummy sample is assumed to be warpage-free immediately after the 
175 °C/90 s transfer molding process and is subjected to thermal history consisted of (i) 
cooling from the molding temperature (175 °C) to 30 °C in 30 min, (ii) heating from 30 °C to 
PMC temperature (175 °C) in 11 min, (iii) PMC at 175 °C for 1 hr, 2 hr or 4 hr (iv) cooling 
down to 30 °C in 27 min. Analysis of the coupled chemical-thermo-mechanical problem was 
implemented in a sequential approach such that the evolution of  over time was first 
determined from the cure kinetics model (3), the viscoelastic relaxation modulus (2) and the 
chemical shrinkage strain (11) were then calculated as a function of time, followed by solving 
the viscoelastic problem numerically using the FE method. Note that it requires two 
independent moduli for properly describing the multidimensional viscoelastic behavior. In 
addition to the relaxation modulus (4), it is assumed that the bulk modulus of the molding 
compound is constant (26.7 GPa), since the molding compound is 90%-filled with silica, of 
which the elastic modulus remains roughly the same in the temperature range considered. 
11 
can be seen that the numerical results agree well to the experimental measurements. In 
addition, from Figs. 7-10 it is observed that, comparing to the 175 °C PMC schedule, the 150 
°C schedule would shift the final warpage towards either less positive or more negative. The 
analysis demonstrated that accurate warpage and stress predictions can be achieved by 
including both chemical shrinkage and viscoelastic behaviors in the numerical simulation.

3. 4  Conclusions 
A coupled chemical-thermo-mechanical modeling methodology is developed for 
considering the constitutive behavior of epoxy molding compound. The methodology consists 
of a cure kinetics model for determining the degree of curing reaction, a reaction-thermal 
model that considers the stress-free volume expansion or contraction as a function of 
chemical reaction and temperature change, and a cure-dependent viscoelastic relaxation 
model. The model was applied to simulate the warpage evolution of a bimaterial dummy 
package under process conditions and validated to shadow Moiré measurements. From the 
analysis results it is observed that, while the chemical aging of the molding compound 
contributed little to the total crosslinking reaction, its effect on warpage of the encapsulated 
package is as significant as the effect of thermal expansion mismatch. Simulations using the 
proposed methodology can be applied to optimize packaging process for improving 
manufacturing yields and package reliability.

ABSTRACT 
A series of monotonic and cyclic experiments, including 
constant strain-rate, creep and cyclic loading tests at 
isothermal temperatures between 25°C and 150°C, were 
performed to characterize the viscoplastic behavior of Pb-free 
Sn2.4Ag solder. The constitutive model of the solder was 
developed by fitting the monotonic test results to the Anand 
viscoplastic model. Finite element model based on the Anand 
constitutive model was then applied to simulate solder 
responses under various cyclic loading histories, and 
compared to the experimental results. From the comparison it 
was observed that the Anand model reproduces the isotropic 
hardening behavior of the Sn2.4Ag solder; but as a result of 
lacking tensorial state variable, the model could not capture 
the kinematic hardening response under load reversal. 
Nevertheless, the thermal recovery behavior of the Sn2.4Ag 
solder is limited under cyclic creep loading, and the Anand 
model is still suitable for predicting the Sn2.4Ag solder 
response under low-stress cyclic loading conditions. 
KEY WORDS: lead-free, viscoplastic, cyclic, Anand model 
INTRODUCTION 
Driven by environmental awareness and government 
legislation, there was a major movement in the last decade for 
developing Pb-free technology as an alternative to the toxic 
Pb-bearing materials in soldering interconnections. The 
activities have resulted in a large amount of knowledge and 
Pb-free electronic products on the consumer market segment. 
However, insufficient understanding on the material response 
under extended cyclic stressing conditions had limited the Pb-
free conversion in application spaces requiring high reliability. 
In order to successfully implement Pb-free solders for these 
applications, it is important to re-establish the reliability 
model, related acceleration factor and testing approach for Pb-
free interconnects. As a first step towards this goal, the 
constitutive behavior of a Pb-free Sn2.4Ag solder under cyclic 
loading is characterized in this study. 
Solder joints work both as electrical and mechanical 
interconnections in electronic devices. Under typical service 
conditions, the temperatures of Sn-based solder joints are 
higher than half of their melting points (in absolute 
temperature scale), and as a result, the solder joints would 
exhibit strong time-independent plastic and time-dependent 
creep behaviors. For the purpose of modeling solder 
constitutive behavior for reliability prediction, both plastic and 
creep responses should be included in the inelastic constitutive 
model for solder joints. 
A widely used approach for modeling the time-dependent 
inelastic behavior of solder is the unified viscoplastic model. 
The phrase “unified” represents that the inelastic response is 
considered by coupling creep and plastic strains into a single 
quantity. A number of unified viscoplastic models have been 
proposed for solder alloys, e.g., Busso et al. [1], Fossum et al. 
[2] and Bai et al. [3]. One of the most popular constitutive 
models that have been adopted for describing solder joint 
behavior is the Anand model [4, 5]. In the Anand model, a 
state variable is used for describing the nonlinear hardening or 
softening effect of microstructure. Many researchers had 
applied the Anand model to simulate Pb-bearing and Pb-free 
solder behaviors (e.g., [6]).

In the constant strain-rate experiment the solder sample 
was loaded with strain rate of 210-6 1/s, 210-5 1/s or 210-4 
1/s, at a constant temperature of 25°C, 75°C, 125°C or 150°C. 
In these tests solder samples were loaded in the environment 
test chamber 100 min prior to test starting to ensure thermal 
equilibrium. Results of the constant strain-rate monotonic tests 
are shown in Fig. 3. It was observed from Fig. 3 that, as the 
strain rate increases, the saturation stress increases. In addition, 
the saturation stress decreases as test temperature increases. 
The test results for the 210-6 1/s conditions exhibited 
softening behaviors which is typically observed in low strain-
rate tests.

In the creep experiments, for the purpose of characterizing 
the low strain-rate responses, solder column samples were 
tested at temperatures of 25°C, 75°C, 125°C and 150°C with 
stress levels below the saturated stresses obtained from the 
constant strain-rate tests. For the cases of 25°C tests, creep 
characterizations were conducted at constant stresses of 13 
MPa, 15.5 MPa, 18 MPa and 21 MPa. For the 75°C cases, 
tests were conducted at 4 MPa, 7.5 MPa, 11.5 MPa and 15 
MPa. For the 125°C cases, tests were conducted at 3 MPa, 5.5 
MPa, 8 MPa and 10.5 MPa. For the 150°C cases, tests were 
conducted at 2 MPa, 4 MPa, 6 MPa and 8 MPa. During the 
test the samples were first loaded at a constant deformation-
rate of 2.510-4 mm/s to the designated creep stress level, and 
then held until steady-state creep deformation fully developed. 
Results of the creep tests are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen 
from Fig. 4 that the Sn2.4Ag solder exhibits both strong 
transient and steady-state inelastic responses under creep 
conditions. 
UNIFIED VISCOPLASTIC MODEL 
For describing the inelastic behavior of the Sn2.4Ag solder, 
a unified constitutive model was applied for fitting the 
constant strain-rate and creep experiment results. Unified 
viscoplastic constitutive model is established using state 
variables: internal state variables are related to the states of 
material microstructure, and are used to represent the 
macroscopic inelastic responses. The internal state variables 
could be considered as the average effects of dislocation and 
their interactions with other microstructures. Two types of 
state variables with critical microstructural effects had been 
suggested for viscoplasticity [7]: the scalar-valued drag stress, 
and the tensor-valued back stress. The scalar drag stress is 
used to model the development of hardening or softening 
associated with isotropic effects. The back stress tensor is used 
to model the kinematic hardening effect. 
The viscoplastic unified model considers the inelastic 
response by combining creep and plastic strains as a single 
quantity, which is defined as

The pairs of the saturated stress and the corresponding stain 
rate (*, I ) were obtained from the steady-state responses of 
the creep tests and the stress plateaus of the constant strain 
rate conditions. By fitting the experimental data points of the 
saturated stress vs. corresponding stain rate to (11) using a 
nonlinear least-square fitting procedure, the values of A, m, n, 
Q/R and the ratios ˆ /s were obtained. Comparison of the 
fitted model and the experimental results is shown in Fig. 5.

The second step of the fitting procedure focuses on the 
evolution of the state variable during the transient stage of the 
constant strain rate tests. Under constant strain rate condition, 
(7) can be casted in terms of the slope of the stress-strain 
curve by substituting (9) into (7). Because data fitting by using 
this equation requires calculating the slopes of the 
experimental curves, a better approach is to perform data 
fitting by using the integral form of the equation, given by

The values of s0, h0, a, and  were obtained by fitting (12) 
with the constant strain-rate experimental results. The 
remaining parameter, sˆ , was then obtained from ˆ /s . The 
fitted Anand model parameters for the Sn2.4Ag solder are 
given in Table 1. Note that the experimental data for the 
higher strain rate conditions (210-4 1/s) had a different trend 
from those for the lower strain rate conditions (210-5 1/s and 
210-6 1/s). A single set of Anand model parameters was 
inadequate for describing these rate-dependent responses, and 
a more complicated viscoplastic model would be required to 
properly consider the solder responses over the full strain rate 
space. Since in this study the focus is toward modeling the 
responses of solder under minimal creep conditions, the 
Anand model parameters given Table 1 were developed in 
favoring the low strain rate situations. Comparisons of the 
fitted model and the constant strain-rate experimental results 
are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6 it can be seen that the Anand 
model correlates better to the low strain-rate experimental data. 
BEHAVIORS UNDER CYCLIC CONDITIONS 
For investigating the Sn2.4Ag solder response under cyclic 
loading conditions and evaluating the applicability of the 
monotonic experiment-deduced Anand viscoplastic model 
under cyclic condition, experimental and numerical analyses 
were performed for both stress- and strain-controlled cyclic 
loading conditions. The solder specimen and the test apparatus 
used in the cyclic experiment were identical to those used in 
the monotonic characterization tests. In the numerical analysis, 
the Anand viscoplastic model was implemented in the finite 
element software ANSYS for calculating the inelastic strain 
response. The finite element model consists a single row of

Stress-controlled cyclic creep tests under isothermal 
conditions were first investigated. The loading waveform 
considered for the cyclic creep test consists of ramping the 
stress with a constant strain rate of 210-5 1/s to a high stress 
level, holding the stress at the high level for 1000 s, unloading

CONCLUSION 
In this study the Anand unified viscoplastic model for Pb-
free Sn2.4Ag solder was developed based on tensile creep and 
constant strain-rate experiments. Numerical finite element 
simulations based on the Anand model were applied to model 
solder inelastic responses under stress-controlled cyclic creep 
and strain-controlled cyclic condition with a triangular 
waveform, and compared to experimental measurements. 
From the comparison it was observed that, experimentally the 
Sn2.4Ag solder exhibits both kinematic hardening and thermal 
recovery effects, while the Anand model does not. The 
inability to reproduce these responses can be attributed to that 
the Anand model only considers the isotropic hardening effect. 
Nevertheless, the Anand model gives reasonably good 
prediction of the total inelastic strain response under cyclic 
loading condition. To further improve the model accuracy, an 
alternative viscoplastic model that contains state variables for 
considering isotropic as well as kinematic hardening effects is 
desired for considering the constitutive behavior of the 
Sn2.4Ag alloy.
