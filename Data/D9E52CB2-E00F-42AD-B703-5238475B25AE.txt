Abstract  
This project investigates a generalization of Morse's theorem and its applications in nonlinear 
time-varying (NLTV) systems. The target is to establish a new stability theorem and provide 
certain useful tools so that the designs of controllers are more flexible. The theorem of Morse came 
from adaptive control theory and becomes a very powerful tool for the stability analysis of linear 
time-invariant (LTI) systems. Roughly speaking, Morse's theorem says that a LTI system is stable 
provided that it is detectable and has bounded output energy. In this project, we has completed a 
generalization of the classic Morse's theorem and proposed several possible applications in control 
areas.  
Morse's theorem is strongly related to the Lyapunov theory. Most of classic results need the 
existence of a positive definite Lyapunov function to guarantee asymptotic stability. This gives an 
unnecessary restriction for the design of controllers. For examples, in the parking control of 
nonholonomic car, it is easy to find a positive semi-definite Lyapunov function so that its 
derivatives along with trajectories of system are non-positive. But, it is not easy to construct a 
positive definite Lyapunov function with negative definite derivatives. Thus, several well-known 
theorems such as Lyapunov theorem and Kransovski-LaSalle theorem cannot be used here. 
Alternatively, it needs to prove the Lyapunov stability directly and guarantees the attractivity by 
using LaSalle invariance principle. In contrast to the classic Lyapunov theorems, this project 
relaxes the assumption of positive definiteness by employing an integrable condition of output 
function in a spirit of Morse's theorem. From the view-point of applications, this will greatly help 
the design of controllers as in the case of the parking control of nonholonomic car. Due to the 
complex structure of NLTV systems, the classic definition of detetcability in LTI systems cannot 
be used directly to deduce asymptotic stability. Thus, we first propose a suitable and practically 
applicable definition of detectability for NLTV systems. Under the condition of bounded output 
energy, asymptotic stability of equilibrium point can then be guaranteed. One contribution of this 
result is that it not only extends classic Lyapunov theorems but also generalizes a theorem of 
Anderson and Moore in linear time-varying systems as well as certain results of Byrnes and Martin 
in autonomous systems. Besides, the project also propose several possible applications of the 
extended Morse's theorem in control systems such as the design of observers in NLTV systems and 
the stability analysis of interconnected systems, e.t.c.. Through these applications, we demonstrate 
how the results of the project can provide a solid foundation of control theory and a new tool for 
the design of controllers.   
 
Keywords: Detectability, positive semi-definiteness, bounded output energy, Lyapunov stability, 
Morse theorem, observers, interconnected systems.

([24,35])，主要的改革為減弱能量函數導數為負定的條件，只需其為半負定並假設某些不變
特性成立下，仍可斷定系統是李阿普諾漸進穩定的。在實際的物理系統應用上，往往找到的
能量函數(通常為動能加位能)其導數只為半負定(negative semidefinite)，故無法應用李阿普諾
的穩定性定理，此時 LaSalle 不變法則即可派上用場。因此，從 1960 年代直到現在，LaSalle
不變法則在實際的應用上，一直廣受歡迎。從理論的角度來看 LaSalle 不變法則，其減弱能
量函數的條件可有效增加能量函數的選擇性(即增加 Lyapunov functions candidates)，使控制
器設計更有彈性。從這樣的角度來看，假如能進一步減弱李阿普諾函數的正定性假設，將可
允許更多的 Lyapunov functions candidates，使控制器的設計有更多的選擇，並減化整個設計
的過程。從實際的應用層面來看，有些系統連正定且具有半負定導數的李阿普諾函數都不容
易找到，故李阿普諾定理甚至 LaSalle 不變法則都不足以協助穩定性的判斷，此時，若可放
鬆李阿普諾函數的相關假設(如允許半正定的李阿普諾函數或其他有用的條件)並可獲致相同
的穩定性結果，將對控制器設計有很大的助益。本計劃正是朝向這些目標，提出了一個更廣
泛的穩定性定理，以協助控制器設計。 
 
C. 推廣古典的摩斯定理之好處 
本計劃所研究之穩定性定理是以線性系統中的摩斯(Morse)定理為推廣目標，其敘述如下 
[10,32] ﹕ 
定理一: (Morse) 令 A 及 C 為 p*p 與 q*p 矩陣，則 Axx =& 為穩定性系統若且惟若(C, A)
為可偵測的(detectable)且輸出函數 Cxy = 滿足下列不等式: 
.)(
2
0
∞<∫ ∞ dtty                               (1) 
摩斯定理常使用在線性系統的適應性控制上，其不需假設能量函數(即李阿普諾函數)的正定
性即可證明系統的穩定性，並以系統的有限輸出能量(式(1))來取代能量函數的半正定性與導
數之半負定性，將可允許更多的 Lyapunov functions candidates，使控制器的設計更具彈性，
P. 6  
更廣義的 Ricatti 方程式之對稱矩陣解有關，一般而言該對稱矩陣也只是半正定的，卻可用
來確定內在穩定性(internal stability;即無干擾下的穩定性)[13]。在這些情況下，李阿普諾矩
陣所對應的李阿普諾函數 PxxV T= 並非正定的，故無法使用古典的李阿普諾定理來證明系統
的漸進穩定性。因此，我們若希望推展這些結果到更廣泛的非線性時變系統，類似的方法將
無法再使用。事實上，線性代數無法在非線性系統中使用，若同時無法引用標準的李阿普諾
定理(因缺乏正定性)，此時將需要類似定理一的廣義摩斯定理來協助之。 
從以上的討論可見，摩斯定理的推廣無論在理論基礎或實際應用上，皆有其重要性與便
利性。其在一般的非線性時變系統之推廣，對整個控制理論的發展與我國的學術地位均有很
大的幫助。除此之外，摩斯定理亦與許多常見的穩定性定理有關，推廣了摩斯定理也將同時
推廣了這些相關定理，由此可見推廣摩斯定理的重要性與理論價值。 
 
D. 國內外相關研究 
有關穩定性分析的相關文獻，國內外均相當豐富，因為篇幅因素，以下僅列出與摩斯定 
理相關之結果並分成三段討論之。 
D.1 穩定性相關理論的發展 
李阿普諾(Lyapunov)可以說是近代穩定性分析的奠基者。他在 1892 年的博士論文中
[31](英譯本)，定義了何謂穩定性，並給予一個現今文獻稱之為李阿普諾函數的驗證方法，
李阿普諾定理的均勻漸進穩定部份其條件是必要的，即 UAS 蘊含存在有一個正定且
decrescent 並具有負定的導數之李阿普諾函數(稱為 converse Lyapunov theorem [23,40])。但就
如前面所述，實際應用上不容易找到這種李阿普諾函數。例如在力學系統中，李阿普諾函數
(即能量函數)通常取動能加位能，其導數往往只為半負定(negative semidefinite)，常見的例子
有單擺及高階的力學系統[23]，在這種情形下，將有必要推廣李阿普諾定理。大約在 1952 
年，文獻[5] 提出改良的一個新理論，即減弱能量函數導數的條件為半負定並假設某些不變
特性成立下，仍可斷定系統是李阿普諾漸進穩定的。不約而同的，LaSalle 在 1960 年代左
右提出了一個現今稱為 LaSalle 不變法則的較廣泛定理，亦可推得相同的結果，在當代的文
獻中就通稱該定理為 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理[40]。其中所謂的不變特性指的是在能量函數導
數的零根集合內之軌跡只有零軌跡，若我們令能量函數導數為虛擬輸出，則該不變特性亦可
翻譯為零態可觀性[27] (zero-state observability，定義詳見[10])。從 1960 年代直到現在，
LaSalle 不變法則或 Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理在實際的應用上，一直廣受歡迎。可惜的是，
Krasovskii-LaSalle 定理只適用於週期系統，對一般的時變系統並不適用。以控制應用的角度
P. 8  
推廣。至於一般的時變系統，則還有發展空間。其中，[19]處理一般的非線性時變系統，但
僅考慮非時變的李阿普諾函數，[22]則考慮互聯(interconnected)系統，對各別子系統滿足某些
降階的均勻漸進穩定性條件下，提出一個 UAS 的結果。這些結果都還不完全，對於一般的
非線性時變系統，類似定理的完整結果仍有待研究。文獻[6]與[17]則是這些結果在控制器設
計問題上的應用。 
假如我們令 V 的導數為虛擬輸出，則平衡點 x=0 對限制在 V 的導數之零根集合內之軌
跡是均勻漸進穩定的條件，可視為一可偵測性條件，且積分 V 的導數可得(1)，以這樣的觀
點來看，上述結果可看成摩斯定理的特例，因此推廣摩斯定理也同時推廣了半正定的李阿普
諾定理，反之則不一定成立，這說明了研究摩斯定理之推廣的另一個理論價值。 
D.3 摩斯定理的其他相關研究 
摩斯定理除了相關於半正定的李阿普諾定理以外，亦與其他的研究有關。首先考慮李阿
普諾矩陣方程式(5)，設系統 x& = Ax 且輸出 y=Cx，令 P 是滿足(5)的半正定對稱矩陣，取半
正定的李阿普諾函數 V=xTPx，可得 2yV −=&  ，此時(1)成立。反之亦成立。亦即李阿普諾矩
陣方程式(5)有半正定的解等價於(1)式成立，而摩斯定理則等於說 A 是穩定的若且唯若(C,A)
是可偵測的，這正是廣為人知的有關李阿普諾矩陣方程式(5)的定理[42]。Anderson 和 Moore 
在文獻[2]推廣了此一結果到線性時變系統，其考慮下列的微分矩陣方程式 
0)()()()()()()( =+++ tCtCtPtAtAtPtP TT&                       (6) 
並假設均勻完全可觀(uniformly completely observable)之條件成立，則[2]證明系統是 UAS 若
且唯若 (6)有一個均勻正定與有界的解。若令 P(t) 是滿足 (6)的解並取李阿普諾函數
V=xTP(t)x，可得 2yV −=& ，此時(1)成立而且可觀的條件可由可偵測性的條件來推廣之，因此
Anderson 和 Moore 的結果亦可視為摩斯定理的一個特例。除了線性時變系統的相關結果，
文獻[10]提出了一個定理推廣摩斯定理到非線性週期系統，但仍須假設較強的零態可觀性條
件。綜觀上述，要推廣摩斯定理到非線性時變系統又僅用可偵測性條件，雖具有相當的挑戰
性(由於時變系統的複雜性)，但將有意義的推廣了上述古典的穩定性定理。 
 
E. 本計劃研究目的與重點 
穩定性分析做為控制理論的一個重要基礎，雖然不像控制器的設計可立即得到具體的應
用，但是其對控制器的設計方法與方向卻有很大的啟發作用。國際上已有多位著名的學者投
入相關的研究(如 Teel 的團隊，[29]-[30]，或 Aeyels 的團隊，[1] )，其著眼點在於建立
了基礎的穩定性理論，可協助發展新的控制器設計，例如自走車的非線性控制發展史即為最

其中 Xx∈  為狀態變數， X∈0 為歐式空間 pℜ 的一個開且連通 (open and connected, i.e.,

有起始時間 0tt = 且起始狀態 0xx = 之(7)的解將以符號 ),,( 00 xttφ 表示之。 
為了推廣摩斯定理到非線性時變系統，我們需要定義何為弱零態可偵測性(weak 
zero-state detectability ; WZSD) 及漸近可偵測性(asymptotic detectability; AD)如下。 
Definition 1. System (7)-(8) is weakly zero-state detectable if, for any unbounded sequence { nt } 
in ),0[ ∞  and any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ  of solutions of (7) which, lies within a compact subset 
K of X and satisfy the following equation 
                   ..,0)),,(,(lim eaxttttth nnnnnn =++∞→ φ ,       (9) 
there is a subsequence }{ mn of }{n  and a time sequence }{ ms  with mm ns ≤≤0  such that

It is said to be locally weakly zero-state detectable if WZSD holds on some open neighborhood of 
the origin. 
Definition 2. System (7)-(8) is asymptotically detectable (AD) if, the following conditions hold. 
(a) For any 0>ε , any 0>s  and any unbounded sequence { nt } in ),0[ ∞ , there exists a 
0)( >εδ  such that if δ<nx ,, Ν∈∀n  and the following equation

0)( >εδ  such that the following implication holds: 
εδ <⇒< )()0( sxx                               (17)

for almost all t  in ],0[ s . Moreover, for any limiting solution x  w. r. t. { nt } that satisfies (18) 
for almost all t  in ),0[ ∞ , it holds that either 0)( 0 =tx  for some 00 ≥t  or the origin is a 
ω -limit point of x .  
    下列的結果可用以簡化 AD 之驗證。 
Proposition 1. Consider system (7)-(8) where h is continuous in x, uniformly in t. Suppose (C1) 
and (C2) hold. Then, the system is asymptotically detectable. 
    藉由上述結果，我們可使用在一個集合內之一致均勻穩定性條件(UAS)進一步簡化 AD
之驗證工作，相關定義如下。 
Definition 4. Consider ordinary differential equation (7) and let S  be any subset of X×∞),0[  
satisfying S⊆×∞ }0{),0[ .  
(a) It is said that all solutions constrained in XS ×∞⊆ ),0[  are uniformly globally bounded if, 
for any 0>r  there exists a r~  such that for any rx <0 and any solution ),,( 00 xttφ of (7) 
satisfying 0,)),,(,( 000 ≥≥∀∈ ttSxttt φ , we have .,~),,( 000 ttrxtt ≥∀<φ  
(b) It is said that the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable in S  if there exists an open subset 
U of X , with U∈0 , such that the following conditions hold. 
(c) For any 0>ε , there exists a 0)( >εδ  such that for any 00 ≥≥ ts , any δ<0x , and any 
solution ),,( 00 xttφ of (7) satisfying sttSxttt ≤≤∀∈ 000 ,)),,(,( φ , we have εφ <),,( 00 xts . 
(d) For any 0>ε , there exists a 0)( >εT  such that for any 00 ≥t , any Tts +≥ 0 , any 
Ux ∈0 and any solution ),,( 00 xttφ of (7) satisfying sttSxttt ≤≤∀∈ 000 ,)),,(,( φ , we have 
εφ <),,( 00 xts . 
If pX ℜ= , all solutions constrained in S are uniformly globally bounded and (c)-(d) holds with { }rxxU p <ℜ∈=  for any 0>r , it is then said that the origin is uniformly globally 
asymptotically stable in S.  
    以下為了討論方便，對任何的函數 qXg ˆ),0[: ℜ→×∞  定義一個集合如下:

結合 Theorem 1 與 Proposition 3 並使用下列假設可推得廣義的摩斯定理如下。 
(H2) There exists a function ),0[: ∞→Xβ , with 0)0( =β  and continuous at the origin such 
that, for all 00 ≥≥ tt  and all solutions ),,( 00 xttφ  of (5),

Theorem 2. (GMT). Consider a system of the form (7)-(8) where (C1) and (C3) holds. Suppose 
the system is locally asymptotically detectable and (H2) holds on some open neighborhood of the 
origin. Then, the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable. If pX ℜ= , all solutions are uniformly 
globally bounded and (H2) holds with β  being locally bounded, then the origin becomes 
uniformly globally asymptotically stable under asymptotic detectability.                     
    使用 Proposition 2 來簡化 AD 條件，則由 Theorem 2 可得下列定理。 
Proposition 4. Consider a system of the form (7)-(8) where f and h are both continuous periodic 
functions with the same period. Suppose the origin is UAS in )(hZ and (H2) holds on some open 
neighborhood of the origin. Then, the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable. If pX ℜ= , all 
solutions are uniformly globally bounded and (H2) hold with β  being locally bounded, then the 
origin is uniformly globally asymptotically stable under the condition that the origin is UGAS in 
)(hZ .   
Proposition 4推廣了Byrnes及Martin在非線性非時變系統的結果[10]，並可推得下列推廣
的Krasovskii-LaSalle定理[39]，此定理首先由Kalitine在1982年發現[21]。 
Corollary 2. Consider a differential equation of the form (7) where f is a continuous periodic 
function. Let X be an open and connected neighborhood of the origin and ),0[),0[: ∞→×∞ XV  
be a continuously differentiable function with the same period as f and 0,0)0,( ≥∀= ttV . Suppose

origin is UAS in )(VZ & . By further assuming that pX ℜ=  and all solutions are uniformly 
globally bounded, the origin is uniformly globally asymptotically stable provided that the origin is 
UGAS in )(VZ & . 
當考慮線性時變系統時，Theorem 2 可推得下列定理。該定理推廣了 Anderson & Moore
在 1969 年的結果[2]，並將可觀性的條件減弱為可偵測性條件。 
Proposition 5. Consider a linear time-varying system of the form (7)-(8) where pX ℜ= , 
xtAf )(=  and xtCh )(= . Suppose A  is bounded. Then, the origin is exponentially stable

下列常見的選擇，可使α 滿足上述(1)-(2)的條件。 
(3) .)sin( yt=α  
(4) .)sin()cos( ytxt +=α  
因此對於自走車之停車控制問題，我們可找到許多可能的控制器使閉迴路系統之原點為
UGAS。這個過程所設計出的穩定性控制器與早期非拘束系統最常使用的控制法則很接近
[34,36]，但使用不同的 approach 與證明。若根據 Theorem 2 則可放寬α 為連續的週期函數
之假設，允許α 為非週期函數，並可考慮更一般的追蹤控制問題，此時相同的推論亦可適用，
但需考慮『極限系統』，詳細推導請參考附錄二的英文全文。 
 
C. 相關應用 
    在控制器的設計上，經常會產生互聯系統的形式，非線性系統的設計由於其複雜性，我
們一般希望將其降階處理之，以簡化控制器設計。最常用的方法則為化成串聯系統，當個別
子系統皆有某種特性，我們希望整個系統亦具有類似的特性。以穩定性為例，若個別子系統
皆為漸進穩定的，我們希望推得整個系統亦為漸進穩定的。這樣的一個結果，已在文獻[38]
提出來，而文獻[22]再加以推廣，我們將應用推廣的摩斯定理將這些結果進一步推廣。此外，
在線性系統裡面有所謂的分離法則(separation principle)，該法則敘述穩定系統之控制器設計
與觀測器的設計可分開處理之，其概略的敘述為使用狀態迴授之穩定性控制器若代入觀測得
到之估測狀態，依然可以穩定整個系統[12]，本段將使用針對互聯系統所推得的結果來設計
具有分離法則特性的觀測器。這些結果強化了推廣的摩斯定理之重要性與用處。 
為了簡化討論，本段假設 pX ℜ= ， pX ℜ≠ 的局部情形可類推而得。假設存在一個參考

    在結束本段的討論之前，我們討論Kokotovic在1992年得獎演說上所提到的一個知名例子

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The paper investigates uniform asymptotic stability 
(UAS) for nonlinear time-varying (NTV) systems 
from the state-output viewpoint. Uniform Lyapunov 
stability (ULS) as well as uniform attractivity are 
treated simultaneously by employing detectability 
and an integral inequality relating to output function. 
The goal is to extend a theorem of Morse proposed in 
linear time-invariant systems (LTI) to NTV systems.  
 
Morse's theorem is closely related to the following 
Lyapunov matrix equations: 
                             ,0=++ CCPAPA TT                        (1) 
where A  and C are pp × and pq × matrices, 
respectively, and ),( AC  is a detectable pair. It is 
well-known that A is stable if and only if (1) has a 
positive semidefinite solution P (Wonham, 1985). 
Moreover, the solution is unique and can be 
described as .)(
0
dtCeCeP AtTTAt∫ ∞=  If we define an 
output map as Cxy = , it can be verified that 
,)(
2
000
dttyPxx T ∫ ∞=  ,0 px ℜ∈∀  where 
)()( ⋅=⋅ Cxy and )(⋅x  is a solution of Axx =  with 
.)0( 0xx = Then, the condition that ∞<∫ ∞ dtty 20 )(  is 
equivalent to the existence of positive semidefinite 
solutions of (1). Particularly, the following result 
first discovered by Morse is readable from the 
observation above (Morse, 1990; Byrnes and Martin, 
1995). For the simplicity, it will be referred as 
Morse's theorem throughout this paper. 
Theorem 1. Let A  and C be pp × and 
pq × matrices, respectively. Then, A is stable if and 
only if ),( AC  is detectable and the following 
inequality holds: 
                        ,)(
0
2 ∞<∫ ∞ dtty                              (2) 
where )()( ⋅=⋅ Cxy  and )(⋅x  is a solution of Axx = . 
 
Morse's theorem is very useful for those systems 
having an output function given in priori, such as 
dissipative systems. On the extension of Morse's 
theorem to NTV systems, the main problem is how to 
define a suitable detectability condition such that a 
similar result as in Theorem 1 holds. Implicitly, this 
is related to the positive definiteness of Lyapunov 
functions. To see such relation, let P be a solution of 
(1) and PxxV T=  be the associated Lyapunov 
function. If ),( AC  is observable, it is well-known 
that V is  positive definite (Khalil, 1992). By contrast, 
it can only be guaranteed to be positive semidefinite 
under the detectability condition in general. Thus, the 
standard Lyapunov theory cannot be used due to 
lacking the positive definiteness.  
 
In present literature, observability is frequently used 
to replace detectability in order to avoid the difficulty 
described in the above. In (Anderson and Moore, 
1969), a concept of uniform complete observability 
(UCO) was defined. Moreover, they consider the 
following differential matrix equation 
     0)()()()()()()( =+++ tCtCtPtAtAtPtP TT      (3) 
     
constant )(0 Kk  which dominates g  over K×∞),0[ . 
The following lemma shows that (A1) is implied by 
the uniformly bounded property of  f. 
Lemma 1.  Consider (5) with f being uniformly 
bounded. Then, (A1) holds. 
Proof. For any compact XK ⊂ , let )(0 Kk  be a 
positive constant which dominates f over K×∞),0[ . 
Define 0,)( 0 ≥∀= ssksKµ . Then, it can be directly 
checked that (7) holds and hence (A1) is true. This 
completes the proof of this lemma.                             ■ 
 
 
2.2 Asymptotic detectability: basic definitions and 
relations  
 
Let us recall the weak zero-state detectability from 
(Lee and Chen, 2002) and define a stronger 
detectability condition as follows. The latter will be 
used to guarantee the ULS and UAS properties. 
Definition 1. System (5)-(6) is weakly zero-state 
detectable (WZSD) if, for any unbounded sequence 
{ nt } in ),0[ ∞  and any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ  of 
solutions of (5) which, lies within a compact subset K 
of X and satisfy the following equation 
..,0)),,(,(lim eaxttttth nnnnnn =++∞→ φ ,                  (8) 
there is a subsequence }{ mn of }{n  and a time 
sequence }{ ms  with mm ns ≤≤0  such that 
0),,(lim =+∞→ mmmm nnnmnm xttsφ .                       (9) 
It is said to be locally weakly zero-state detectable if 
WZSD holds on some open neighborhood of the 
origin. 
Definition 2. System (5)-(6) is asymptotically 
detectable (AD) if, the following conditions hold. 
(a) For any 0>ε  and any 0>s , there exists a 
0)( >εδ  such that if δ<nx ,, ℵ∈∀n  and the 
following equation 
0)),,(,(lim =++∞→ nnnnnn xttttth φ                          (10) 
holds for almost all ],0[ st ∈ , we have  
εφ <+∞→ ),,(inflim nnnnn xtts                               (11) 
where { nt } is any unbounded sequence in ),0[ ∞  and 
)},,({ nnn xttφ  is any sequence of solutions of (5) such 
that Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, stn ≤≤∀ℵ∈∀  for some 
compact subset K of X . 
(b) If )},,({ nnn xttφ  satisfies the following equation 
0)),,(,(lim =++∞→ nnnnnn xttttth φ                      (12) 
for almost all t in ),0[ ∞ , there is a subsequence 
}{ mn of }{n  and a time sequence }{ ms  with 
mm ns ≤≤0  such that 
0),,(lim =+
∞→ mmmm nnnmnm
xttsφ                         (13) 
where { nt } is any unbounded sequence in ),0[ ∞ and 
)},,({ nnn xttφ  is any sequence of solutions of (5) such 
that Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, ntn ≤≤∀ℵ∈∀  for some 
compact subset K of X. 
It is said to be locally asymptotically detectable if AD 
holds on some open neighborhood of the origin. 
 
From the definitions, it can be seen that AD is a 
stronger condition than WZSD. More interestingly, 
the following result shows that WZSD also implies 
AD under certain standard stability conditions.  
Lemma 2. Consider a system of the form (5)–(6). 
Suppose the origin is uniformly Lyapunov stable. 
Then, the system is locally asymptotically detectable 
if and only if it is locally weakly zero-state detectable. 
In addition that pX ℜ=  and solutions are globally 
bounded, the system is asymptotically detectable if 
and only if it is weakly zero-state detectable. 
Proof. Without loss of generality, it is sufficient to 
prove the “if” part. By the ULS property, for any 
0>ε  there exists a constant 0)( >εδ  such that, for 
any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ  of solutions of (5) with 
,, ℵ∈∀< nxn δ  the inequality 
2/),,( εφ <+ nnnn xtts holds for all 0>s  and all 
.ℵ∈n  This results in 
.0,2/),,(inflim >∀<≤+∞→ sxtts nnnnn εεφ  Thus, 
condition (a) in Definition 2 holds. Now suppose that 
the systems is locally weak zero-state detectable. Then, 
there is an open set U  containing the origin such that 
WZSD holds on U. Since the origin is uniformly 
Lyapunov stable, there is also an open subset U~  of U 
containing the origin such that, every solution 
),,( 00 xttφ of (5) with Ux ~0 ∈  lies within a compact 
subset of U. Thus, (b) also holds on U~  in view of the 
WZSD condition. Thus, local weak zero-state 
detectability implies local asymptotic detectability 
under the uniformly Lyapunov stable condition. In 
addition that pX ℜ=  and solutions are globally 
bounded, all solutions having the initial conditions 
contained in a compact set of pℜ  must be contained 
in another compact set of pℜ . In this case, it is easy 
to see that (b) in Definition 2 is equivalent to the 
WZSD condition. This completes the proof of the 
lemma.                                                                         ■ 
 
In (Lee and Chen, 2002), it was shown that WZSD is 
a necessary condition of UAS. In view of Lemma 2, it 
can be deduced that AD is also a necessary condition 
of UAS. Particularly, the following result is readable 
from Lemma 2 and the result given in that paper. 
Lemma 3. Consider a system of the form (5)–(6). 
Then, the system is locally asymptotically detectable 
if the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable. In 
addition that pX ℜ= , the systems is asymptotically 
detectable if the origin is uniformly globally 
asymptotically stable (UGAS).  
 
 
2.3 Specification to continuous periodic systems 
 
In this subsection, the AD condition will be further 
characterized by the zero-state detectability condition 
and a Lyapunov stable condition constrained in the 
zero-locus of the output function for continuous 
     
and 1T .  Using the fact that 0/1limˆlim =≤ ∞→∞→ nx nnn  and 
Lemma 4, it can be seen that ∞→nt . Let

)ˆ,ˆ,(ˆ),,( nnnnnn xttxtt φφ = , nttNn ≥∀≥∀ ,0 . Then, 
),,( nnn xttφ  is also a solution of (5) starting from nx  
at time ntt =  for each .0Nn ≥  Moreover, we 
have δφ == nnnnn xxtt ),,( , 2/ˆ),,( 0εφ =nnnn xts  
and .,,2/ˆ)~,,( 00 Nnsttxtt nnnnn ≥∀<<∀<< εφδ  
Replacing the sequence }{n by a suitable subsequence, 
we can assume that the limit 1)(lim TtsT nnn ≥−= ∞→  
exists. In the following, let us divide the proof into 
two parts according to the value of T .  
(a) The case of .∞<T  Let 
02/2/ˆ 11 >≥−= TTTT . We first claim that 
1),,ˆ( εφ ≥+ nnnn xttT  for large enough n. Since 
Tts nnn =−∞→ )(lim and 1ˆˆ TTTT +<< , the inequality 
1
ˆˆ TtTstT nnn ++<<+  holds, for large enough n. If 
1),,ˆ( εφ <+ nnnn xttT , we have 2/ˆ),,( 0εφ <nnnn xts  
for large enough n, by the choices of 1ε  and 1T . This 
contradicts the fact that 2/ˆ),,( 0εφ =nnnn xts . Thus, 
the claim is true.  
 
Moreover, the fact nn stT <+ˆ  implies that for large 
enough n, )ˆ,ˆ,(ˆ nnn xttφ is contained in the compact 
subset { }2/ˆ00 ε≤ℜ∈= xxK p  of  X  for all t in 
]ˆ,ˆ[ Ttt nn +  by the choice of ns . Let ε  be any positive 
constant. In view of (H1), there exists a 0),(~ 0 >Kεδ  
such that (14) holds for all 0ˆ 0 ≥≥≥ tss  and all 
solutions ),,( 00 xttφ of (7) having δ~0 <x  and 
contained in 0K  on the interval ]ˆ,[ 0 st . Since 
0ˆlim =∞→ nn x , (14) can be applied to the solution 
)ˆ,ˆ,(ˆ nnn xttφ  on the interval ]ˆ,ˆ[ Ttt nn +  for large 
enough n. Thus, the following inequality holds (with 
nts =  and Tts n ˆˆ += ):

results in

From the theory of real analysis (Lang, 1983), we can 
replace the sequence }{n by a suitable subsequence

fact that .,)ˆ,ˆ,(ˆ nnnnn stxt ≤<∀> τδτφ  This completes 
the proof of the theorem.                                             ■ 
 
 
3.2 A generalized Morse's theorem 
  
In this subsection, a generalized Morse's theorem will 
be proposed by combining Theorem 2 with a newly 
developed criterion given in (Lee and Chen, 2002). 
First, let us state a condition as follows. 
(C2) For each compact XK ⊂ , there exists 
0)( >KM such that, for all solutions ),,( 00 xttφ  of (5)

The following result comes from (Lee and Chen, 2002) 
by employing Theorem 1 and Proposition 3 in that 
paper. 
Proposition 2. Consider a system of the form (5)-(6). 
Suppose the origin is uniformly Lyapunov stable and 
(C2) holds. Then, the origin is uniformly 
asymptotically stable when the system is locally 
WZSD. In addition, if pX ℜ= and the solutions are 
globally uniformly bounded, then the origin becomes 
uniformly globally asymptotically stable under the 
WZSD condition.                                                        ■ 
 
Consider the following hypothesis like (2).   
(H2) There exists a function ),0[: ∞→Xβ , with 
0)0( =β  and continuous at the origin such that, for 
all 00 ≥≥ ts  and all solutions ),,( 00 xttφ  of (5) that

Now, the following result that generalizes Morse's 
theorem can be proposed based on Theorem 2 and 
Proposition 2. 
Theorem 3. Consider a system of the form (5)-(6) 
where (A1)-(A2) holds. Suppose the system is locally 
asymptotically detectable and (H2) holds on some 
open neighborhood of the origin. Then, the origin is 
uniformly asymptotically stable. In addition that 
pX ℜ=  and solutions are uniformly bounded, the 
origin is uniformly globally asymptotically stable 
provided that the system is asymptotically detectable 
and (H2) hold with β  being locally bounded.                     
Proof. Notice that AD implies WZSD. Thus, it is 
sufficient to show that (H2) implies (C2) and (H1) in 
view of Theorem 2 and Proposition 2. Since β  is 
continuous at the origin and (H2) holds on some open 
neighborhood of the origin, we can replace X  by a 
smaller open and connected neighborhood of the

Abstract 
This paper investigates uniform (global) asymptotic stability (UAS and UGAS) for nonlinear time-varying 
(NTV) systems from the state-output viewpoint. We propose a generalization of Morse's theorem which 
essentially says that based upon a new detectability and a bounded output-energy conditions, uniform 
Lyapunov stability (ULS) and uniform attractivity of the origin can be guaranteed simultaneously. 
Furthermore, the new detectability condition can be verified by a simpler condition involving limiting 
solutions, and is implied by several well-used assumptions such as the classical detectability condition, the 
uniformly complete observability condition and a UAS property constrained in the zero-locus of output 
function. Consequently, we deduce an extension of the well-known Krasovskii-LaSalle theorem proposed 
by Kalitine where the assumption of “positive definite” Lyapunov functions is relaxed to only 
“nonnegative”. Moreover, the observability conditions often assumed in present literature can be loosened 
by merely requiring detectability. A practical example from nonholonomic chained systems is employed to 
illustrate that based on the proposed generalization of Morse's theorem, the UGAS property can 
effectively be guaranteed without finding a positive definite Lyapunov function. As an application of main 
results, a new stability criterion is presented. It contains a recent result proposed by Kalitine, and can be 
viewed as a general separation principle in NTV systems. A well-known example from a paper of 
Kokotovic is provided to demonstrate its use in helping the designs of observers. These applications 
justify the value of this paper.

(4) if and only if (2) holds under the UCO condition. Recently, the paper (Byrnes & Martin, 1995) dealing 
with nonlinear time-invariant systems proves that if a system is zero-state observable, the origin is 
uniformly Lyapunov stable and (2) holds, then the origin is UAS. Quite recently, an interesting integral 
characterization of UGAS for differential inclusions was proposed (Teel et al., 2002). Under a mild 
assumption, Theorem 1 of that paper shows that the origin is UGAS when (2) holds for )( xy α=  with 
α  being a class K function1 (which in turns implies “observability”). While these results generalize the 
Morse's theorem by using some kind of observability, it still has a room to be improved. Particularly, it is 
interesting and important to ask if it is possible to use detectability rather than observability to guarantee 
the same result as in Theorem 1 for general NTV systems.  
To answer this question, uniform Lyapunov stability needs to be studied first. As explained before, it 
is related to the use of positive semidefinite Lyapunov functions. Historically, the development of 
Lyapunov theory via nonnegative Lyapunov functions was triggered by (Bulgakov & Kalitine, 1978) and 
further extended by several authors (Bulgakov, 1980; Bulgakov, 1981; Aeyels & Sepulchre, 1992; Kalitine, 
1995; Iggidr et al., 1996; Iggidr et al., 1999, Iggidr & Sallet, 2003). In the early stage of this research, the 
object was to generalize Lyapunov as well as Krasovskii-LaSalle Theorems (Barbashin & Krasovskii, 
1952; LaSalle, 1968) for autonomous and periodic systems (Bulgakov, 1980; Bulgakov, 1981; Kalitine 
1982). In recent development, it is focused on possible extensions to more general time-varying systems 
(Kalitine, 1995; Aeyels & Sepulchre, 1992; Iggidr & Sallet, 2003).  
More explicitly, these results show that the origin is ULS when there is a positive semidefinite 
Lyapunov function V with 0≤V& , so that the UAS property holds for those trajectories constrained in the 
zero locus of V. By further assuming that the UAS property holds in the zero locus of V& , UAS of the 
origin can then be guaranteed. By defining a virtual output ,),( xtVy &−=  (2) can be derived from 
0≤V&  and the UAS property constrained in the zero locus of V&  can be interpreted as a detectability 
condition. In this way, nonnegative Lyapunov functions based theorems can be viewed as a generalization 
of the Morse's theorem in some respect. Conversely, generalizing Morse's theorem can also provide an 
alternative way to derive and extend the Lyapunov theorems via nonnegative functions. In present 
literature, there are other approaches to investigate the asymptotic property of systems. For       
instance by assuming ULS and using a nontrivial extension of classical persistent excitation condition, a 
novel result was proposed to guarantee UGAS for a class of NTV systems (Loria et al., 2001). Based on a 
nested Matrosov’s theorem, a further generalization was proposed in the paper (Loria et al., 2005). In  
                             
    1A function ),0[),0[: ∞→∞ρ  is said to be a class K function if it is continuous, strictly increasing 
and 0)0( =ρ .

2. Preliminaries 
2.1 Two useful lemmas from real analysis 
In this subsection, two useful lemmas from real analysis are given. These results will frequently be 
used throughout this paper. In this paper, we denote 222

and the Lebesgue meaure of a set pS ℜ⊆  as S . Let I be any (open or closed) interval. It is said that a 
statement )(tP  holds for almost all t in I if { } 0)( =∈ falseistPIt  (Lang, 1983). 
In the following, a well-known result about the relation between the convergence in pL  space and 
the pointwise convergence is given (Lang, 1983). 
Lemma 1. Let I be an (open or closed) interval contained in ),0[ ∞ with I∈0 and }:{ qn If ℜ→ be a 
sequence of measurable functions that are pL -integrable on every compact interval of I, for some p >0.

    Next, a lemma similar to the intermediate-value theorem in the theory of real analysis is proposed. 
Lemma 2. Let 1l  and 2l  be two constants, and 
pba ℜ→],[:λ  be a continuous function. Suppose that

Due to 2)(lim)( ltd dt ≤= −→ λλ , we have 2)( ld =λ  and bda << . Let { }.)(,sup 1ltdtatc ≤≤≤= λ  
Using a similar argument, it can be shown that 1)( lc =λ , dca << , and .,)( 1 dtclt ≤<∀>λ  This 
completes the proof of this lemma.                                                        ■ 
2.2. A basic assumption and two related results 
In this subsection, a basic assumption is made and will be used throughout this paper. Two interesting 
results regarding the basic assumption are also proposed briefly.  
In this paper, we study a nonlinear time-varying system described as 
),( xtfx =&                                            (5) 
),( xthy =                                            (6) 
where x is contained in an open and connected subset (i.e., a domain) X of pℜ  with X∈0 , qy ℜ∈ , and  
f and h are both measurable functions defined on X×∞),0[  with f(t,0)=h(t,0)=0 for all 0≥t . 
Throughout this paper, we assume that f  satisfies the Caratheodory condition to guarantee the existence 
and extension theorems of solutions of (5) (Hale, 1980). Moreover, we denote ),,( 00 xttφ  as a trajectory 
of (5) starting from 0x  at time 0tt = .  
A basic assumption that will frequently be used is given below (Artstein, 1978; Narendra & 
 7
∞<+≤ ≥≥ 1),(sup),(sup 000 xtgztg tt , 00 δ<−∀ xz . Thus, { } Sxzz ⊆<− 00 δ . Therefore, S  is an 
open set. Now, let us show that S  is also a closed set. Let 0x  be a limit point of S. Then, there exists a 
sequence { }kx  contained in S  such that 0lim xxkk =∞→ . Again, since g is continuous in x, uniformly in 
t, there exists a 01 >δ  so that ,1),(),( 0 <− xtgztg 0≥∀t , 10 δ<−∀ xz . Particularly, there exists a 
large enough 0m  such that ,1),(),( 00 <− xtgxtg m 0≥∀t . This also implies that 
∞<+≤ ≥≥ 1),(sup),(sup 0000 mtt xtgxtg  and thus, Sx ∈0 . Hence, S is a closed set. Since X  is 
connected, we have XS =  (Lang,1983). Particularly, the claim is true.  
In the remainder, we prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose g is not uniformly bounded. Then, 
there exists a compact XK ⊂0  such that, for each Ν∈n  we have nxtg nn >),(  for some 0≥nt ,  
0Kxn ∈ . Since 0K  is compact, there exists a subsequence { kn } of { n } such that { }knx  converges to a 
point 0x  in 0K . The continuity of g implies that ∞== ∞→∞→ ),(lim),(lim 0 kkk nnknk xtgxtg . This 
violates the claim above. Thus, g is uniformly bounded and particularly, (C1) holds with f replaced by g. 
The proof of the lemma is then completed.                                                  ■ 
3. Asymptotic Detectability 
In this section, a practical example from nonholonomic chained systems is proposed to point out the 
difficulty on defining detectability when one would like to extend the Morse's theorem to one in 
non-periodic time-varying systems. Then, asymptotic detectability (AD) that is stronger than WZSD 
defined in the paper (Lee & Chen, 2002) is introduced to resolve the raised difficulty. Moreover, limiting 
solutions introduced in that paper is refined and used to simplify the AD condition. For periodic systems, 
it is shown that the AD condition is implied by a UAS property constrained in the zero-locus of output 
functions and thus, can be derived from the classical detectability condition in LTI systems.  
3.1 A motivated example 
In this subsection, a benchmark problem from nonholonomic chained systems is revisited to indicate 
the difficulty on defining detectability in non-periodic time-varying systems.  
Example 1. Consider the following third order chained system (Murry & Sastry, 1993). 
                           
,3
32

&

where u and v are the control variables. It is well known that this system cannot be stabilized by using 
time-invariant continuous feedback (Brockett, 1983). We refer readers to the survey paper (Kolmanovsky 
& McClamroch, 1995) for more extended discussions. Here, we focus on the stability analysis.  
Following the paper (Loria et al., 2005), let us consider a time-varying controller as 
),,( 321 xxtxu χ+−=  and 32 xuxv −−=  where ℜ→ℜ×∞ 2),0[:χ  is a continuous and uniformly 
bounded function with 0)0,0,( ≡⋅χ . Then, the closed-loop system can be written into  
 9
detectability condition in the following. The latter will be used to guarantee the ULS and UAS properties 
in next section. 
Definition 1. System (5)-(6) is weakly zero-state detectable (WZSD) if, for any unbounded sequence { nt } 
in ),0[ ∞  and any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ  of solutions of (5) which, lies within a compact subset K of X 
and satisfy the following equation 
..,0)),,(,(lim eaxttttth nnnnnn =++∞→ φ ,                   (12) 
there is a subsequence }{ mn of }{n  and a time sequence }{ ms  with mm ns ≤≤0  such that 
0),,(lim =+∞→ mmmm nnnmnm xttsφ .                       (13) 
It is said to be locally weakly zero-state detectable if WZSD holds on some open neighborhood of the 
origin. 
Definition 2. System (5)-(6) is asymptotically detectable (AD) if, the following conditions hold. 
(a) For any 0>ε , any 0>s  and any unbounded sequence { nt } in ),0[ ∞ , there exists a 0)( >εδ  such 
that if δ<nx ,, Ν∈∀n  and the following equation 
0)),,(,(lim =++∞→ nnnnnn xttttth φ                       (14) 
holds for almost all ],0[ st∈ , we have  
εφ <+∞→ ),,(inflim nnnnn xtts                           (15) 
where )},,({ nnn xttφ  is any sequence of solutions of (5) such that 
Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, stn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀  for some compact subset K of X . 
(b) For any unbounded sequence { nt } in ),0[ ∞ and any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ of solutions of (5) that 
satisfies Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, ntn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀  for some compact subset K of X, and the following 
equation 
0)),,(,(lim =++∞→ nnnnnn xttttth φ                    (16) 
for almost all t in ),0[ ∞ , there is a subsequence }{ mn of }{n  and a time sequence }{ ms  with 
mm ns ≤≤0  such that 
.0),,(lim =+∞→ mmmm nnnmnm xttsφ                     (17) 
It is said to be locally asymptotically detectable if AD holds on some open neighborhood of the origin. 
Remark 1. Roughly speaking, condition (a) in Definition 2 states a Lyapunov stable condition when 
solutions are constrained in the zero locus of the output function. As for condition (b), it states an 
attractivity condition and is similar to WZSD with a minor difference. Indeed, condition (b) says that (16) 
⇒  (17) for those sequences )},,({ nnn xttφ  of solutions satisfying that for each n in Ν , ),,( nnn xttφ  
belongs to a fixed compact set of X for all t in the compact interval ],[ ntt nn + . This requirement is 
implied by the condition that the whole solution ),,( nnn xt⋅φ  is lying with a fixed compact set of X. 
Particularly, condition (b) in Definition 2 guarantees attractivity for more rich sequences of solutions and 
thus, it is a slightly stronger condition than the WZSD condition by the definition.                  ■ 
    From the definitions, it can be seen that AD is a stronger condition than WZSD. Conversely, the 
following result shows that WZSD also implies AD under certain standard stability conditions.  
 11
Thus, it is omitted here.  
Lemma 7. Consider a differential equation of the form (5). Suppose (C1) holds. Let s  be a positive 
constant and K be a compact subset of X. Then, for any sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ of solutions satisfying 
Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, stn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀ there exist a continuous function x  defined on ],0[ s  and a 
subsequence { kn } of { n } such that, the associated subsequence { }),,( kkkk nnnn xttt +φ  converges 
uniformly to x on ],0[ s . If ∞→nt  and )},,({ nnn xttφ satisfies Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, ntn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀  
then there exist a limiting solution x  and a subsequence { kn } of { n } such that the same conclusion 
holds for all 0>s .                                                                    ■ 
The following lemma shows that limiting solutions satisfy certain limiting equations relating to the 
original system. Since it can be proven along the same line as in Proposition 1 of the paper (Lee & Chen, 
2002), we omit it. 
Lemma 8. Consider a differential equation of the form (5) where f is continuous in x, uniformly in t. Let 
s  be any positive constant and { nt } be any unbounded sequence in ),0[ ∞ . Then, every limiting solution 
x , defined on ],0[ s  and w. r. t. { nt }, satisfies the following equation:

≤≤∀++= ∫∞→ τττ                    (18)  
    By employing limiting solutions, the following simplified condition can be proposed to guarantee the 
AD condition. 
(C2) For any 0>ε , any 0>s  and any unbounded sequence { nt } in ),0[ ∞ , there exists a 0)( >εδ  
such that the following implication holds: 
εδ <⇒< )()0( sxx                                    (19) 
for any limiting solution x  defined on ],0[ s  w. r. t. { nt } with   
                             0))(,(lim =+∞→ txtth nn                                  (20) 
for almost all t  in ],0[ s . Moreover, for any limiting solution x  w. r. t. { nt } that satisfies (20) for 
almost all t  in ),0[ ∞ , it holds that either 0)( 0 =tx  for some 00 ≥t  or the origin is a ω -limit point of 
x .  
    The following result gives a simplified condition for asymptotic detectability.  
Proposition 1. Consider system (5)-(6) where h is continuous in x, uniformly in t. Suppose (C1) and (C2) 
hold. Then, the system is asymptotically detectable. 
Proof. We first show that (C2) implies (a) in Definition 2. Let 0>ε  be any constant. According to (C2), 
there exists a 0)( >εδ  such that implication (19) holds. Let 0>s  be any constant, { nt } be any 
unbounded sequence in ),0[ ∞  and )},,({ nnn xttφ  be any sequence of solutions of (5) that satisfies 
2/δ<nx ,, Ν∈∀n  and Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, stn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀  for some compact subset K of X. To 
verify (a), we can further assume that (14) holds for almost all ],0[ st∈ . In view of Lemma 7, there exist 
a limiting solution x  defined on ],0[ s and a subsequence { kn } of { n } such that the subsequence { }),,(
kkkk nnnn
xttt +φ  converges uniformly to x on ],0[ s . Since (14) is true and h is continuous in x, 
 13
qXg ˆ),0[: ℜ→×∞  as follows: 
{ }0),(),0[),()( =×∞∈= xtgXxtgZ .                            (22) 
It will be frequently used throughout the paper.  
In the remainder of this subsection, let us show that the UAS property in )(hZ , as a more natural 
detectability condition, implies the AD condition for continuous periodic systems. Its proof is postponed 
to Appendix.  
Proposition 2. Consider system (5)-(6) and the associated set )(hZ . Suppose that f and h are both 
continuous periodic functions with the same period. Then, local asymptotic detectability holds provided 
that the origin is UAS in )(hZ . By further assuming that pX ℜ= , asymptotic detectability is implied by 
the UGAS property of the origin in )(hZ .                                                   ■ 
    In LTI systems, it is easy to see that the classical detectability is equivalent to the UAS property 
in )(hZ . Particularly, the following result is readable from Proposition 2. 
Corollary 1. Consider a system of the form (5)-(6) where Axf = and Cxh =  for some matrices A and C. 
Then, the system is asymptotically detectable if (C, A) is detectable.                             ■    
4. Main Results 
In this section, a theorem, called the generalized Morse's theorem (GMT), is proposed. We first show 
that uniform Lyapunov stability of the origin is implied by local asymptotic detectability and an integral 
condition. Then, by strengthening this integral inequality, we further show with the help of the paper (Lee 
& Chen, 2002) that uniform attractivity can also be guaranteed. Thus, we obtain uniform Lyapunov 
stability and uniform attractivity simultaneously under the same set of assumptions. Essentially this is the 
GMT, see Theorem3. Moreover, it is shown that the GMT extends certain results proposed in (Anderson 
& Moore, 1969) and (Byrnes & Martin, 1995) by relaxing observability conditions. To demonstrate the 
practical applicability of GMT, Example 1 is revisited where we use GMT to show that under some 
condition, the UGAS property of the origin can be guaranteed both in periodic and non-periodic cases.  
4.1 A new stability criterion for uniform Lyapunov stability 
In this subsection, we study the ULS property with the help of output function. First, let us consider 
the following assumption. 
(C3) Any solution )0,,( 0ttφ  of (5) starting from the origin is the zero function, i.e., 00 ,0)0,,( tttt ≥∀=φ . 
    Under (C3), the following lemma can be proposed. It will be used in the proof of the main theorem in 
this subsection. The proof is postponed to Appendix.  
Lemma 9. Consider a system of the form (5)-(6). Suppose (C1) and (C3) hold. Let 0ε  be a positive 
constant, { nt } be any sequence in ),0[ ∞  and { }),,( nnn xttφ  be any sequence of solutions of (5) 
satisfying 0lim =∞→ nn x . Suppose there exists a sequence { }ns  such that 0≥≥ nn ts  and 
0),,( εφ =nnnn xts , .Ν∈∀n  Then, { ns } is an unbounded sequence in ),0[ ∞ , i.e., .lim ∞=∞→ nn s     ■ 
To state the main result in this subsection, we need the following hypothesis. It plays a central role in 
 15
Theorem 3. (GMT). Consider a system of the form (5)-(6) where (C1) and (C3) holds. Suppose the 
system is locally asymptotically detectable and (H2) holds on some open neighborhood of the origin. Then, 
the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable. If pX ℜ= , all solutions are uniformly globally bounded 
and (H2) holds with β  being locally bounded, then the origin becomes uniformly globally 
asymptotically stable under asymptotic detectability.                     
Proof. Notice that AD implies WZSD. Thus, it is sufficient to show that (H2) implies both (C4) and (H1) 
in view of Theorem 2 and Proposition 3. Since β  is continuous at the origin and (H2) holds on some 
open neighborhood of the origin, we can replace X  by a smaller open and connected neighborhood of 
the origin such that β  is also locally bounded and (H2) holds on X  in the local case. By the local 
boundedness of β , ∞<= ∈ )(sup xM Kx β  for each compact XK ⊂ . Then, it is straightforward to see 
that (25) implies (24). Thus, (C4) can be derived from (H2) where X  is replaced by a suitable open 
neighborhood of the origin. In the following, let us show that (H1) can also be deduced from (H2). Let 
0>ε  be any constant. Since β  is continuous at the origin, with 0)0( =β , there exists a 0)( >εδ  
such that εβ <)(x  for all .δ<x  Let 0ˆ 0 ≥≥≥ tss , δ<0x  and ),,( 00 xttφ  be any solution of (5) 
defined on the interval ]ˆ,[ 0 st . According to (H2), the following inequality holds: 
).1ˆ()()),,(,()),,(,( 0
ˆ 2
00
ˆ 2
00
0
+−≤<≤≤ ∫∫ ssxdxthdxth stss εεβττφτττφτ  
Thus, (23) holds. The local case of the theorem follows from Theorem 2 and Proposition 3. Obviously, the 
same argument can be applied to global case, i.e., pX ℜ= , under the extra conditions that all solutions 
are uniformly globally bounded and β  is locally bounded. This completes the proof of the theorem.   ■ 
Remark 3. In Theorem 1 of the paper (Teel et al., 2002), a novel integral characterization of UGAS w.r.t. a 
set was proposed for differential inclusions. If we consider the case of a single point for ordinary 
differential equations, (10) of that paper says that (H2) holds for )( xh α=  and )( xγβ =  where α  
and γ  are both class K functions. Then, the system is “observable” by the property of class K function 
and particularly, AD holds. Moreover, the condition that all solutions are uniformly globally bounded can 
be derived from UGSTS and (10) of that paper. Since 0)0( =β , we have 0,0))0,,(( 00 ≥≥∀= ttttφα  
by (H2). Thus, (C3) is also true. Consequently, under a mild assumption (C1), Theorem 1 of that paper can 
be derived from Theorem 3.                                                             ■ 
Remark 4. Quite recently, there exist several interesting theorems regarding the UGAS property of the 
origin (Loria et al., 2001; Loria et al., 2005; Lee & Jiang, 2005). By assuming ULS previously, these 
results focus on the study of uniform attractivity to propose certain criteria that can be used to guarantee 
UGAS. In contrast to these results, in Theorem 3, uniformly Lyapunov stability and uniform attractivity 
are treated simultaneously by employing an integral inequality and a detectability condition.          ■ 
    In general, the verification of AD is not simple. However, it can be checked by certain simplified 
conditions as it was shown in section 3. Particularly, the following result can be proposed for continuous 
periodic systems by combining Theorem 3 and Proposition 2.  
 17
the definition. The corollary follows from Proposition 4. The proof of the lemma is then completed.    ■ 
    Before closing this subsection, let us revisit Example 1 proposed in subsection 3.1 to demonstrate the 
practical usefulness of the proposed generalized Morse's theorem. From this example, it can be seen that 
based on our approach, uniformly Lyapunov stability as well as uniform attractivity can be verified 
simultaneously without using a positive definite Lyapunov function.  
Example 2. Consider again system (8a)-(8c). In addition, we assume that χ  is continuous in Txx ),( 32 , 
uniformly in t. By employing Theorem 3, we would like to show that the origin is UGAS under the 
following condition. 
(C5) For each 02 ≠x  and any unbounded sequence { }nt  in )0[ ∞ , there exists a subsequence { }knt  of { }nt  such that { })0,,(:ˆ 2xttt knk +χχ a  converges uniformly to a non-constant function ),( 2x⋅χ  on 
every compact subset of )0[ ∞ .  
Indeed, (C1) holds by Lemma 4 and (H2) is true with V=β  in view of (9). Moreover, 
023 ≤−= xV&  implies that all solutions of subsystem (8b)-(8c) are uniformly globally bounded, and any 
solution Txxxt ))(),(),(()0,,( 3210 ⋅⋅⋅=⋅φ  of (5) starting form the origin has 032 ≡= xx . In view of (8a), 
we also have 01 ≡x  and hence, (C3) holds. Since 11 xx −=&  is a linear stable system, it is BIBS stable 
(Chen, 1986). By employing the uniformly bounded property of χ , all solutions of subsystem (8a) are 
also uniformly globally bounded. Particularly, all solutions of (8a)-(8c) are uniformly globally bounded. 
To guarantee UGAS, it remains to check the AD condition according to Theorem 3. Due to the continuous 
and time-invariant properties of output function, Proposition 1 can be used to guarantee the AD condition.

4.3 Specification to linear time-varying systems 
Throughout this subsection, we assume that pX ℜ= , xtAf )(=  and xtCh )(=  where A  and 
C  are some time-varying matrix-valued functions with A  being bounded. The generalized Morse's 
theorem is used to relax the observability condition assumed in the paper (Anderson & Moore, 1969). As a 
corollary, the Morse's theorem, i.e., Theorem 1, can be deduced from the proposed results. For simplicity, 
we omit the precise statement that pX ℜ= , xtAf )(=  and xtCh )(=  in most of situations.  
First, let us show that (H2) is implied by the following condition. It can be viewed as a time-varying 
version of (2).  
(C6) For each px ℜ∈0  and any solution ),,( 0xtsφ  of (5), the following inequality holds:

Lemma 10. Consider a linear time-varying system of the form (5)-(6). Suppose A  is bounded. Then, (C6) 
holds if and only if there exists a positive constant b  such that the following inequality

Proof. The sufficient part is trivial. It remains to show that the necessary part is also true. Thus, we can 
assume that (C6) holds. Let { }peee ,,, 21 L  be an orthonormal basis of pℜ . Then, every vector px ℜ∈  
can be described as ii

1986). By employing Cauchy inequality, it can be seen that the following inequality holds:

,,)( 2 pxxbx ℜ∈∀=β  it can also be seen that (H2) holds. This completes the proof of the lemma.     ■ 
In the sequel, a technique condition is assumed below. It is a part of the UCO condition (Anderson & 
Moore, 1969).

The following lemma shows that (C7) always holds under the bounded assumption of C.

asymptotically stable. It is well known that uniform asymptotic stability implies exponential stability in 
LTV systems (Khalil, 1992). Furthermore, (C7) is implied by (C6) in view of (28) in Lemma 10. This 
shows that (b) also implies (a) and hence, (a) and (b) are equivalent. Let P be a solution of (3) satisfying 
(31). Consider a Lyapunov function .)( xtPxV T=  Then,  
.,0,)())()()()()((),( 2 pTT xtxtCxtPtAtAtPtPxxtV ℜ∈∀≥∀−=++= &&           (32) 
This implies that (C6) holds by integrating the two sides of (32) and using (31). Thus, (c) implies (b). It 
remains to show that the converse is also true under the extra condition that A and C are both continuous.  
This part is standard in linear system theory, see for instance the book (Khalil, 1992). Indeed, let

                      ,0),()()()()()()( ≥∀−−−= ttCtCtPtAtAtPtP TT&  
as in the proof of Theorem 3.10 in the book (Khalil, 1992). Then, P also satisfies (3). This shows that (b) 
implies (c). The proof of the proposition is therefore completed.                                 ■    
    The following corollary is readable from Lemma 11 and Proposition 5. 
Corollary 3. Consider a linear time-varying system of the form (5)-(6). Suppose A  and C are both 
continuous and bounded. Then, the following conditions are equivalent. 
(a) The origin is exponentially stable.  
(b) The system is asymptotically detectable and (C6) holds.  
(c) The system is asymptotically detectable and (3) has a nonnegative and uniformly bounded solution P. 
    In Corollary 1, it was shown that asymptotic detectability is implied by usual detectability condition 
in LTI systems. Moreover, (27) is equivalent to (2). Then, classical Morse's theorem, i.e., Theorem 1, can 
be deduced from Corollary 3. From this, it can be seen that Theorem 3 generalizes the Morse's theorem in 
LTI systems without using extra condition. 
In the following, let us show that AD is implied by uniformly complete observability (UCO) defined 
in (Anderson & Moore, 1969). This indicates that the classical theorem proposed in that paper can also be 
deduced from Proposition 5. Recall that ))(),(( tAtC  is UCO if the following condition holds:

5. Application to the designs of observers  
In this section, a new stability criterion is presented based on GMT. It extends a result proposed in 
(Kalitine, 1995) as well as a well-known result for cascaded systems (Panteley & Loria, 1998). Two 
examples are proposed to illustrate how it can help the designs of observers. From these applications, it 
can be seen that we don’t need to find a positive definite Lyapunov function with negative definite 
time-derivative to guarantee the UAS property of overall systems. Rather, we can verify an integral 
inequality and check certain stability conditions (in order to check AD condition) separately. Thus, the 
proposed criterion can be viewed as a “general separation principle” for nonlinear time-varying systems. 
These applications stress the importance of GMT. To simplify the whole discussion, we only consider the 
global case and assume that pX ℜ=  throughout this section. The local case can be treated similarly. 
Consider again a nonlinear time-varying system of the form (5)-(6). Assume that there exists an 
auxiliary variable pxx ˆ)(ˆ ℜ∈= λ  where pp ˆ: ℜ→ℜλ  is a differentiable function with 0)0( =λ . 
Moreover, it satisfies the following equation: 
),()ˆ,(ˆˆ xtgxtfx +=&                                         (35) 
where ppf ˆˆ),0[:ˆ ℜ→ℜ×∞ is locally Lipschitz in xˆ , uniformly in t, and ppg ˆ),0[: ℜ→ℜ×∞  is 
defined as ),()())(,(ˆ),( xtfxxxtfxtg ∂∂+−= λλ  for all ,0≥t px ℜ∈ . We also assume that (35) is in 
the output-injection form in the sense that Kxtxthxtg K ∈∀≥∀≤ ,0)),,((),( η , for any compact subset 
K of pℜ  and some locally bounded function ),0[: ∞→ℜqKη  continuous at the origin with 
0)0( =Kη . 
In the following, two assumptions are made. 
(C8) The origin of the unforced system )ˆ,(ˆˆ xtfx =&  of (35) is UGAS. 
(C9) The following inequality holds: 
                      ,,0)),(),(ˆ,,(),,( 000000
pxtttytxxttxtt ℜ∈∀≥≥∀−≤ αφ              (36) 
where ),,( 00 xttφ  is a solution of (5), )),,(()(ˆ 00 xtttx φλ= , )),,(,()( 00 xttthty φ=  and 
),0[),0[: ˆ ∞→ℜ×ℜ×ℜ×∞ qppα  is continuous at the origin, uniformly in t, with 0)0,0,0,( ≡⋅α , and for 
each fixed 0x  in 
pℜ , the following equation holds: 
                           .0),ˆ,,(lim 00,0ˆ, =→→∞→ yxxtyxt α                              (37) 
    We also need the following condition that is more easily checked than (H2) in practical applications.  
(H3) There exist a positive definite continuous function ),0[: ∞→ℜqγ  and a locally bounded function 
),0[: ∞→ℜ pβ , with 0)0( =β  and continuous at the origin such that, for all 00 ≥≥ tt  and all 
solutions ),,( 00 xttφ  of (5),

Based on Theorem 3, the following result is proposed. It can be viewed as a separation principle for 
general nonlinear time-varying systems. Such viewpoint will be illustrated by two examples below. To

If we define an extended state TTT xxx ),ˆ(= and a virtual output xxy −= ˆ , it can be checked that 
yLCAy )( −=& . Consequently, (H3) holds. Moreover, the first equation is in the form of (35) with 
xBKAf ˆ)(ˆ +=  and BKyg −= . Then, it is in the output-injection form and (C8) just says that the 
closed-loop system using state feedback is stable. Due to the inequality yxxxxx ++≤+≤ ˆˆˆ , (C9) 
holds with yx += ˆ2α . Since all solutions of yLCAy )( −=&  are uniformly globally bounded and 
stable linear systems are BIBS stable, all solutions are uniformly globally bounded. Thus, the well-known 
separation principle can be deduced from Theorem 4.                                         ■      
    From the example above, Theorem 4 can be viewed as a separation principle in nonlinear 
time-varying systems, also see the discussion in Remark 12. In the following, let us show that Theorem 5 
of the paper (Kalitine, 1995) can be deduced as Corollary 5 below from Theorem 4. 
Corollary 5. Consider an ordinary differential equation of the form (5) where f is locally Lipschitz, 
uniformly in t. Assume that the state vector x and the function f can be decomposed as

),0[: 2 ∞→ℜ pia , ,3,2,1=i  are three positive definite continuous functions. Furthermore, assume that 
there exist a function 21),0[: pp ℜ→ℜ×∞ψ  which is locally Lipschitz, uniformly in t, with 
,0,0)0,( ≥∀= ttψ and a continuously differentiable function ),0[),0[: ∞→ℜ×∞ pV such that the 
following inequalities hold:

subsystem )),(,,( 1111 xtxtfx ψ=& , 0=x  is UGAS w.r.t. whole system (5).  
Proof. Define a virtual output ),( 12 xtxy ψ−= . Then, h is continuous in x, uniformly in t, and (H3) holds 
by employing (40) and integrating the two sides of (41). Let 1ˆ xx =  be an auxiliary state and

pxtxtxtfxtf ℜ∈∀≥∀= ψ . By assumptions, fˆ  is locally Lipschitz, uniformly in t, and 
(C8) is true. Furthermore, equation (35) holds with

pp xxtxtxtfxxtfg ℜ∈∀ℜ∈∀≥∀−= ψ .

By the local Lipschitz condition and Lemma 4, Kη  is locally bounded and continuous at the origin with 
0)0( =Kη . Thus, Kxtxthxtg K ∈∀≥∀≤ ,0)),,((),( η , and (35) is in the output-injection form. Due to 
the inequality yxtxxxx ++≤+≤ )ˆ,(ˆˆ 2 ψ , (36) holds with )ˆ,(supˆ 0 xtyx t ψα ≥++=  where α  is 
only the function of xˆ  and y. By assumptions, it is easy to verify that α  is continuous at the origin, 
 27
Furthermore, we have

Then, it is easy to see that (C9) holds with .ˆ3 yx +=α  Thus, the origin of the closed-loop system is 
UGAS by Theorem 4.  
It is interesting to observe that the above arguments can be applied to the following more general 
time-varying systems:

Then, the UGAS property can also be guaranteed based on Theorem 4.                           ■ 
6. Conclusions            
A generalization of the celebrated Morse's theorem has been obtained by employing a new 
detectability condition. Applications to several well-known stability criteria were also provided. An 
interesting example was given to demonstrate flexibility and usefulness of the proposed generalized 
Morse's theorem in the design of nonlinear time-varying systems, especially in the case that a positive 
Lyapunov function is not easily found. The achieved results were further applied to the design of 
observers. Particularly, a new criterion that can be viewed as a general separation principle in NTV 
systems was also proposed. It is possible to build a more general method to study the AD condition by 
employing the concept of limiting systems along the most recent setting (Lee & Jiang, 2005). This issue 
will be addressed in the forthcoming paper. Other future work may toward to applying the achieved new 
stability criteria to study the designs of observers based on separation or certainty-equivalence principles.  
Appendix A: Proof of Proposition 2 
Proof. By the UAS property in )(hZ , there exists an open subset  U of X , with U∈0 , such that 
conditions (a)-(b) of Definition 4 hold for )(hZS = . Since f and h are both continuous periodic functions, 
they are continuous in x, uniformly in t. Thus, (C1) holds and (C2) can be used to guarantee the AD 
condition based on Proposition 1. Let x  be any limiting solution lying within a compact subset of U and 
defined on ],0[ s  w. r. t. an unbounded sequence { nt } in ),0[ ∞ . Then, it satisfies integral equation (18) 
by Lemma 8. To verify (C2), we can assume that (20) holds for almost all t  in ],0[ s . Again by the 
continuous and periodic properties, there exist a subsequence }{

of this part and the theorem.                                                             ■ 
Appendix D: Proof of Theorem 4 
Proof. Based on the Lipschitz condition, (C1) and (C3) hold by employing Lemma 4 and the uniqueness 
theorem of solutions (Hale,1980), respectively. Define a new output )),((~ xthy γ= . Then, (H3) implies 
(H2) where h  is replaced by hoγ  and β  is locally bounded. In view of Theorem 3, it remains to 
check the AD condition for the new output y~ . By the assumption of local Lipschitz and employing both 
Lemma 4 and Proposition1, it is sufficient to verify (C2). Let s  be any positive constant and x  be any 
limiting solution defined on ],0[ s  w.r.t. an unbounded sequence }{ nt  in ),0[ ∞ . Then, there exist a 
compact pK ℜ⊂  and a sequence )},,({ nnn xttφ of solutions, with 
Kxttt nnnn ∈+ ),,(φ ,0,, stn ≤≤∀Ν∈∀  and such that, )},,({ nnnn xttt +φ  converges uniformly to x  
on ],0[ s . By employing (C8) and the converse Lyapunov theorem (Khalil, 1992), there exist three 
positive definite continuous functions ),0[: 2 ∞→ℜ pia , ,3,2,1=i  a locally bounded function 
),0[: ˆ ∞→ℜ pb , and a continuously differentiable function ),0[),0[: ˆ ∞→ℜ×∞ pV such that the 
following inequalities hold:

For simplicity, we denote )),,(()( nnnnn xtttt += φλϕ . Computing the time-derivative of V along the

for almost all ],0[ st∈  via the positive definiteness and the continuity of γ  and using the continuity of 
h. Integrating the two sides of (A12) and taking the limit, the following inequality can be derived:

According to (36)-(37) and the inequalities above, the following inequalities can be derived:

Then, the origin is a ω -limit point of x . Thus, (C2) holds and the proof is then completed.          ■
