ABSTRACT 
The first year project has accomplished the research work concerning the theory and efficient design 
techniques of 2-D general recursive digital filters with linear phase response based on the least square error 
(L2) and minimum peak error (L∞) criteria. We first develop the theory of 2-D general recursive DAFs with 
linear phase response and nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) filter coefficients. Then, 2-D general recursive 
NSHP digital filters with linear phase response constructed by using the 2-D general recursive DAFs has been 
investigated. Moreover, efficient techniques based on the L2 and L∞ criteria has been also developed for 
designing 2-D general recursive NSHP digital filters with linear phase response. The effectiveness of the 
proposed design technique is demonstrated by several simulation examples. The second year project has 
accomplished the research work concerning the theory and efficient design techniques of 2-D general 
recursive Doubly Complementary (DC) digital filters with linear phase response based on the least square 
error (L2) and minimum peak error (L∞) criteria. Based on the theory of 2-D general recursive DAFs with 
linear phase response and nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) filters accomplished in the first research year, 
2-D general recursive DC digital filters with linear phase response constructed by using the 2-D general 
recursive DAFs has been investigated. Moreover, efficient techniques based on the L2 and L∞ criteria has been 
also developed for designing 2-D general recursive DC digital filters with linear phase response. The 
effectiveness of the proposed design technique is demonstrated by several simulation examples. The third year 
project has accomplished the research work for the research topic of developing the theory of 2-D recursive 
QQMF banks with linear phase response for video and image signal processing. The research on the 
development of the theory regarding the 2-D recursive QQMF banks with linear phase response constructed by 
the 2-D general recursive DC filter developed during the second year has been conducted. Efficient design 
techniques based on the L2 and L∞ criteria for the 2-D recursive QQMF banks with linear phase response has 
been developed. The developed theory and proposed design techniques achieve the goal of producing fast and 
satisfactory design results, which is more suitable for the subband coding of video and image signals of 
multimedia data. Simulation results are presented for illustration and comparison.

CHAPTER 1 Design of 2-D general recursive digital filters using 
nonsymmetric half-plane allpass filters 
一 前言:  
A novel structure using recursive nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) digital allpass filters (DAFs) is 
presented for designing 2-D recursive digital filters. First, several important properties of 2-D recursive DAFs 
with NSHP support regions for filter coefficients are investigated. The stability of the 2-D recursive NSHP 
DAFs is guaranteed by using a spectral factorization-based algorithm. Then, the important characteristics 
regarding the proposed novel structure are discussed. The design problem of 2-D recursive digital filters using 
the novel structure is considered. We formulate the problem by forming an objective function consisting of 
the weighted sum of magnitude, group delay, and stability-related errors. A design technique using a 
trust-region Newton-conjugate gradient method in conjunction with the analytic derivatives of the objective 
function is presented to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem. The novelty of the presented 2-D 
structure is that it possesses the advantage of better performance in designing a variety of 2-D recursive digital 
filters over existing 2-D filter structures. Finally, several design examples are provided for conducting 
illustration and comparison. 
 
二 研究目的與文獻探討: 
Many techniques have been presented in the literature for the design of 1-D recursive digital filters using 
the parallel combination of 1-D allpass sections [1]-[5]. The designed 1-D recursive digital filters structures 
possess very low passband sensitivity and doubly complementary (DC) properties. The design of 1-D DC 
digital filters composed of two complex allpass sections is considered in [2], [3] and two real allpass sections 
is discussed in [4], [5]. Furthermore, 1-D allpass filters are utilized to construct the analysis/synthesis filters of 
quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks. It has been shown in [3]-[5] that the designed IIR QMF banks can 
provide approximately linear phase response without magnitude distortion. In [14], 1-D allpass filter 
structures have been successfully applied to the design of two-channel nonuniform-division filter (NDF) 
banks.Recently, the extension of the 1-D allpass structure to the design of 2-D recursive digital filters has been 
widely considered in the literature [6]-[9]. In the technique of [6] for the design of 2-D recursive circularly 
symmetric lowpass filters (CS-LPF), a 2-D allpass filter with quarter-plane (QP) support region for filter 
coefficients is constructed by using a parallel connection of a 2-D allpass filter and an appropriate delay 
element in the form of 21 21
MM
zz

. However, this structure induces some undesired passbands so that a 
noncausal system and a 1-D lowpass guard filter are required to eliminate the extra spikes and achieve the 
circularly symmetric characteristics. To get rid of the delay elements, a modification to the technique has been 
developed in [7] by utilizing a parallel connection of two allpass sections with filter orders appropriately 
selected. Nevertheless, causality and stability of the designed filters are not guaranteed by using these two 
techniques. Unlike the above two design techniques, the techniques presented in [8], [9] employs four allpass 
building blocks with appropriate delay elements to achieve arbitrary cut-off boundaries for 2-D recursive 
digital filters with QP coefficients. During the design process, the stability of the 2-D recursive digital filters is 
guaranteed by assigning a 2-variable very strictly Hurwitz polynomial to the denominator of a 2-D analog 
allpass function and discretizing the analog function through double bilinear transformation. The main 
limitation of these design techniques is that none of them possesses the capabilities in designing most general 
2-D causal recursive digital filter subject to the approximation of frequency response in some optimal sense.  
In this chapter, a novel structure composed of the 2-D recursive digital allpass filters with non-symmetric 
half-plane (NSHP) support regions for the design of 2-D recursive filters is presented. It has been shown in 
[10]-[13] that the 2-D recursive NSHP filters outperform the 2-D recursive QP filters in terms of 
approximating more general frequency response specification. We first develop the theory of the 2-D

CHAPTER 2 Two-dimensional non-symmetric half-plane recursive doubly 
complementary digital filters 
一 前言: 
   This Chapter deals with the problem of two-dimensional (2-D) recursive doubly complementary (DC) 
digital filter design. We present a structure of 2-D recursive DC filters by using 2-D non-symmetric half-plane 
(NSHP) digital all-pass filters (DAFs). The novelty of using 2-D NSHP recursive DAFs to construct a 2-D 
recursive DC filter is that the resulting 2-D NSHP recursive DC filter shows better performance than 
conventional 2-D recursive DC filter based on 2-D quarter-plane (QP) DAFs. Moreover, the proposed 
structure possesses a favorable 2-D doubly complementary half-band (DC-HB) property that allows about half 
of the 2-D NSHP recursive DAF’s coefficients to be zero. This leads to considerable savings in computational 
burden. To deal with the stability of the 2-D NSHP recursive DC filter during the design process, we can 
either impose some necessary constraints on the phases of the 2-D NSHP recursive DAFs or utilize a penalty 
function involving a stability error computed by using a spectral factorization-based algorithm to ensure the 
stability of a designed 2-D NSHP recursive DC filter pair. Design of a diamond-shape 
decimation/interpolation filter is presented for illustration and comparison. 
二 研究目的與文獻探討: 
Two digital filters become a complementary pair if the passbands of one matches the stopbands of the 
other and vice versa. Therefore, complementary digital filters are widely used in many signal processing 
systems where different frequency bands are to be processed separately to measure signal strengths at each 
band or to achieve for example, data compression or noise reduction. Furthermore, a complementary filter 
pair is used to split the input signal in two adjacent bands, and also is of importance for constructing complex 
multirate systems and filter banks. A pair of complementary digital filters H(z) and G(z) can be designed to 
exhibit (1) all-pass complementary property: H(z) + G(z) = A(z), where A(z) is an all-pass function and (2)  
power complementary property: H(z)H(z
-1
) + G(z)G(z
-1
) = 1. This class of H(z) and G(z) is called doubly 
complementary (DC) filters. Various techniques have been presented for the design of one-dimensional (1-D) 
DC filters based on a parallel structure of two 1-D all-pass building blocks [1-4].   
    It has been shown [5,6] that a 1-D recursive DC filter realized using a parallel structure of two all-pass 
building blocks possesses the advantages of very low passband sensitivity because of structure boundedness 
and reduced computational complexity. Recently, the design of 2-D recursive digital filters using a parallel 
connection of four 2-D all-pass filter sections with quarter-plane (QP) support region for filter coefficients and 
delay elements in the forms of 11
z and 12
z was presented in [7]. Due to the advent of digital video systems 
and the rapidly increasing use of digital signal processors, a study of the properties of two-dimensional (2-D) 
DC digital filters and their design methods are of considerable interest. It has been shown in [8] that an 
appropriate structure consisting of 2-D non-symmetric half-plane (NSHP) digital all-pass filters (DAFs) can  
                                           7 
  
Property 1: The phase  )(arg)( 2121  jj e,eD,   of )( 21  jj e,eD is equal to zero at the following specific 
frequency points (termed as the crucial points [8], CPs) in the (ω1,ω2) plane, where arg{x} denotes the phase 
of x: 
                    2 1  0Ω 21 ,i,,ω|ω,ω icp   . 
Property 2: The frequency responses of )( 21  jj e,eA are restricted to 1 or –1 only for (ω1,ω2)ΩCP. The 
details of this property are listed in Table 1. 
We note from Property 2 that that some unwanted passbands or stopbands may be induced when )( 21  jj e,eA  
is utilized for the construction of a 2-D NSHP recursive digital filter. The orders M and N of this 2-D NSHP 
recursive DAF must be appropriately specified to avoid the possible unwanted passbands or stopbands [8]. 
    To ensure the stability of ),( 21 zzA during the design process of determining the coefficients of 
),( 21 zzD , we can impose the following two constraints shown by [9] on the phase of )(
21  jj e,eD : 
 ),(  )2( 2121   ,                         (7) 
and 
 ),(  )2( 2121  , .                        (8) 
An alternative approach to guarantee the stability of a designed ),( 21 zzA  is to employ the spectral 
factorization-based algorithm presented by [8]. During the design process, a numerical stability error 
s (m,n) = d(m,n) – ds(m,n)                             (9) 
can be utilized as a penalty function to constrain the stability of ),( 21 zzA , where d(m,n) denotes the 
denominator’s coefficient array of ),( 21 zzD and ds(m,n) denoting the causal spectral factor of |D(
21  jj e,e )|

is obtained by the use of the spectral factorization-based algorithm. Consider the following two 2-D digital 
filters

following two properties can be easily obtained

Therefore, the construction for G(z1,z2) and H(z1,z2) shown in Figure 3 forms a 2-D NSHP recursive doubly 
complementary (DC) filter pair. In the following, we examine the frequency characteristics of the 2-D NSHP 
recursive DC filters. 
Let the frequency response of these 2-D NSHP recursive DAFs be expressed by

This shows that ),( 21  jj eeG  and its shifted version ),( )()( 21   jj eeG  possess the 2-D DC properties, i.e.,

It is clear from (24) and (25) that G(z1,z2) possesses the DC symmetry with respect to the half-band (HF) 
frequency (ω1,ω2)=(π/2,π/2) in the first quarter of the 2-D frequency plane. These two properties are called the 
DC-HB characteristics. The 2-D DC-HB characteristics in the first quarter plane obtained from the proposed 
2-D NSHP recursive DC filters are depicted in Figure 4. The passband ΩP and stopband ΩS of ),( 21
 jj
eeG are 
symmetric with respect to the half-band frequency. If we set 1 1 2 2p s p s        , the passband of the 
shifted version of ),( 21  jj eeG , i.e., ),( )()( 21   jj eeG , will cover the passband of ),( 21  jj eeH . Moreover, 
(23) shows that we have to find only about half of the independent coefficients di(m,n) for the 2-D NSHP 
recursive DAFs during the design process. These DC-HB characteristics lead to significant reduction in 
computational burden in design and implementation. Conventional 2-D HB filters designed by using 2-D 
finite impulse response (FIR) filters [10,11] consider the magnitude-complementary HB property, 
i.e., 1),(),( )()( 2121    jjjj eeGeeG  only. 
From (15) and (17), we observe that ),( 21  jj eeG  and ),( 21  jj eeH  are simultaneously determined by 
two phase functions θm(ω1,ω2) and θp(ω1,ω2) as follows 
            θm(ω1, ω2) = ),(),(

can be formulated as a problem of finding the phases

四、研究成果與討論 
We present the results of designing a 2-D diamond-shape decimation/interpolation filter using the proposed 
2-D NSHP recursive DC filters. 2-D diamond-shaped decimation/interpolation filters have been widely 
considered for conversion processing between rectangular and hexagonal sampling structures because they 
allow a maximum resolution in the horizontal and vertical directions. The design example of an ideal 2-D 
diamond-shaped filter with a quadrantal symmetry in magnitude response is shown in Figure 4 with ω1p = π/2, 
ω2p = π, and ω1p +ω1s = ω2p +ω2s = π. Moreover, we set the desired phase functions for θm(ω1,ω2) and θp(ω1,ω2) 
as follows: θmd(ω1,ω2) = 0 and θpd(ω1,ω2) = －(M1+M2)ω1/2 －(N1+N2)ω2/2, respectively. Then, the desired 
phase responses 
id (ω1, ω2) corresponding to the denominators Di(z1,z2), i = 1, 2 are given by

Chapter 3  Two-channel quincunx quadrature mirror filter banks using 
two-dimensional digital allpass filters 
一 前言: 
   This Chapter presents a novel structure for the analysis and synthesis filters of two-channel quincunx 
quadrature mirror filter (QQMF) banks. This structure uses an appropriate combination of two-dimensional 
(2-D) recursive digital allpass filters (DAFs) with symmetric half-plane (SHP) support regions. The proposed 
analysis/synthesis filters possess a 2-D doubly complementary half-band (DC-HB) property that facilitates the 
design and implementation of the proposed two-channel QQMF banks. Moreover, the proposed structure 
provides approximately linear-phase response without magnitude distortion. The design problem of the 
proposed QQMF banks is appropriately formulated to result in a linear optimization problem that only 
minimizes the linear-phase error associated with the 2-D SHP DAFs in the pth-norm (Lp) sense. Efficient 
design techniques are developed to solve the Lp optimization problem for finding the coefficients of the 2-D 
recursive SHP DAFs. Finally, we provide simulation results for illustration and comparison. 
二 研究目的與文獻探討: 
Two-dimensional (2-D) quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks have been widely considered for high quality 
coding of image and video data at low bit rates [1, 2]. For this application, a signal is decomposed into several 
frequency subband components. Each subband component in the analysis system is decimated, subband coded, 
and then interpolated at the synthesis system to reconstruct the output signal. 2-D QMF banks are required to 
reconstruct the input signal from the subband signals perfectly when subband coding is not implemented. 
Hence, the design problem of 2-D QMF banks with perfect reconstruction characteristics has been considered 
extensively so far [16,17].  
In the literature, many techniques have been proposed for designing two-channel recursive QMF banks 
with one-dimensional (1-D) allpass digital filters (DAFs) [3-5]. 1-D DAFs are utilized to construct the 
recursive analysis/synthesis filters of QMF banks. The reason of using DAFs as building blocks for 
constructing recursive QMF banks is that the designed recursive QMF banks possess the frequency response 
with approximately linear phase and without amplitude distortion. In [6], 1-D allpass filter structures have 
been also successfully used to the design of two-channel nonuniform-division filter (NDF) banks. 
    In this paper, we present a 2-D recursive symmetric half-plane (SHP) DAF and a parallel structure using 
the 2-D recursive SHP DAF to construct the analysis and synthesis filters of a recursive two-channel quincunx 
QMF (QQMF) bank. The resulting analysis/synthesis filters possess the 2-D doubly complementary (2-D DC) 
properties, i.e., 2-D allpass-complementary and power-complementary properties. Moreover, the proposed 
2-D DC-based analysis/synthesis filters possess an attractive DC symmetry with respect to the half-band 
frequency (ω1,ω2) = (π/2,π/2) in the first quarter of the frequency plane, i.e., the DC-HB property. This 
property leads to the favorable results that almost half of the required filter coefficients can be set to zero and 
                                           19  
  
From (6), we have the overall transfer function of the 2-D two-channel QQMF bank as follows:

for all (ω1,ω2), where 
1d
g  and 
2d
g  represent the system delays of the 2-D QQMF bank. This imposes 
constraints not only that H0(z1,z2) should be an ideal lowpass filter, but also that its behavior for all (ω1,ω2) 
should satisfy the condition given by (8). The designs of 2-D QQMF banks using conventional FIR or IIR 
structures for H0(z1,z2) usually induce magnitude and phase distortions. Moreover, (7) shows that a slight 
modification of the system is required to avoid the transmission nulls at certain frequency points [7]. However, 
this additional modification is unnecessary when the DC-based structure proposed in the next section is 
employed to construct 2-D QQMF banks. Besides, the frequency constraints [8-10] should be satisfied since 
the aliasing artifacts on the flat areas of pictures are particularly visible distortions for human perspective. The 
frequencies (±π,±π) are occupied by the spectral repetitions of sampled signals with the sampling matrix given 
by (1). Hence, the magnitude response of the prototype filter H0(z1,z2) is required to be as small as possible at 
(±π,±π) in order to eliminate the spectral repetitions, as well as the magnitude response of H0(z1,z2) must be 
equal to one at the origin (0,0). By employing the proposed 2-D DC-based structure in the next section, we 
find that the prototype filter H0(z1,z2) would naturally satisfy these frequency constraints. 
First, we present two 2-D recursive digital allpass filters (DAFs) as follows:

As to the stability of the 2-D recursive DAFs Ai(z1,z2), the authors in [11] have extended the stability 
constraints for 1-D IIR DAFs to 2-D case. The stability constraints guaranteeing the stability of Ai(z1,z2) are 
summarized as follows: (I) ),( 21 i  is monotonically decreasing along ω1 axis and θi(π,ω2)= θi(0,ω2)－Miπ
 
for －π≦ω2≦π; (II) ),( 21 i  is monotonically decreasing along ω2 axis and θi(ω1,π)= θi(ω1,0)－Niπ
 
for －
π≦ω1≦π. For simplicity, by specifying the desired phase response ),( 21,  di  to satisfy the above two 
constraints, we can neglect the stability problem and focus on the phase minimization problem given by (23) 
only. Conventional 2-D recursive DAFs have the denominator polynomial Di(z1,z2) in (9) with quarter-plane 
(QP) support region for its coefficients, i.e.,    1 2 1 2

recursive QP DAFs do not possess quadrantally symmetric characteristics. As a result, they are not suitable 
for designing quadrantally symmetric filters such as fan filters and diamond-shaped filters. In contrast, we can 
modify the transfer function (10) by setting di(－m,n) = di(m,n) for 1≦m≦Mi  and 1≦n≦Ni. With this 
modification, the number of independent coefficients can be significantly reduced and the corresponding 
frequency response of Di(z1,z2) becomes

Next, we develop efficient techniques for solving the design problem in the p-th norm error criteria. 
According to the design problem formulated by (23), we find the filter coefficients di(m,n) of the recursive 
SHP DAF Ai(z1,z2) such that the resulting phase response ),( 21 i  given by (25) approximates the desired 
phase response ),( 21,  di , i = 1, 2, 3. The weighted Lp design problem can be written as

Using Definition 3.1 of [14], we can obtain the standard primal form of a linear programming problem as 
follows:

                                             (50) 
where x denotes the primal variable. Next, we describe how to adopt the primal-form affine scaling variant of 
Karmarkar’s algorithm (the PAS algorithm) of [12] for solving (50). Assume that an initial solution x which 
satisfies the constraints is given. Then, x is mapped into a vector y

 with all entries equal to one as follows: 
y

where Dx denotes a diagonal matrix containing the entries of x. Based on the mapping, we create 
             A

To satisfy the equality constraints, we project c~  onto the null space of A

 to obtain 
           
pc  = P c

so that y

equal to zero. We then find a new feasible solution x

 for (50) by taking the inverse mapping of y

    Consider the projection operator given by (54). Substituting (52) into (54) yields

四、研究成果與討論: 
Here, we present simulation results of designing a two-channel 2-D DC-based QQMF bank for 
illustration and comparison. The design results using the proposed technique and the technique presented in 
[15] are presented. The performance for the designed 2-D QQMF bank is evaluated in terms of the peak stop 
attenuation (PSA) of H0(z1,z2), the passband magnitude mean-squared error (PMSE) of H0(z1,z2), the stopband 
magnitude mean-squared error (SMSE) of H0(z1,z2), the phase mean-squared error (PPMSEi) of  ),( 21

Using the same magnitude characteristic as that of [15], we set the stopband edge of H0(z1,z2) to ωs=1.2. 
Correspondingly, the desired magnitude response of  H0(z1,z2) can be written as

We note that the magnitude characteristic given by (61) possesses the HB property. Therefore, about half of 
the coefficients can be set to zero and only uniformly sampled passband frequency grid points are considered 
during the design procedure. The 2-D DC filters H0(z1,z2) and H1(z1,z2) are obtained by selecting M1 = M2 = 5 
and N1 + 1 = N2 = 8, and the order of the phase equalizer is M3 × N3 = 5×7. Based on (34), the ideal group 
delays are 3211 MMMgd  and 3212 NNNgd  . We design a SHP DAF Ai(z1,z2) whose denominator phase 
response )},(arg{ 21  jji eeD  approximates the desired passband phase response ),( 21,  di  obtained by 
substituting 
θm,d(ω1,ω2) = 0                                                     (62)

into (22) for i =1, 2. Then, the proposed design techniques developed in Section V are applied to find the 
coefficients of Ai(z1,z2) in the L2, L1, and L∞ optimal senses, respectively. Since ),( 21,  di  satisfies the 
stability conditions discussed in Section 4.1, we can omit the stability issue and focus the design problem on 
approximating the desired phases. Moreover, the designed analysis/synthesis filters can achieve 
approximately linear-phase responses in the passband with the ideal phase specification given by (63). 
The parameters used for this design are listed as follows: μ = 0.97, ε = 1.0×10－8, and ρ = 1.1×10－7. The 
weighting matrix W is an identity matrix. Significant design results obtained by using the technique of [15]
