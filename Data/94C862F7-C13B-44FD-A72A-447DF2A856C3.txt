was neglected because it is very thin and soft
compared with other components in this study.
So, the MEA can be neglected without
influence the results of deformation and
pressure distribution significantly. The
micro-flow channel plates are composed by a
brass base and a copper structure plate of
micro-flow channel on the base. The
cross-sectional area of the micro-channel is
2×10-4 m (height) by 1.75×10-4 m (width), and
the length of the channel is 2.21×10-2 m. The
dimensions and material properties for the rest
of component of the cell are shown in Table 1

2.2 Boundary Conditions and Assumptions
A single micro-fuel cell was modeled
and the commercial software ANSYS was
adopted for simulation. In order to retrench
computer memory and time of solving for this
case, the element mode SOLID 45 was chosen.
It has a few nodes than other higher grade
element modes, and easily to decide the
boundary conditions on interfacial contact area
than the plane element mode SHELL. Through
the convergence simulations, it can be found
that the simulated results will be converged for
element size level less than 4. So, in this study,
the element size level 3 was chosen. Figure 2
shows the meshed model of the fuel cell. The
bolts and nuts were neglected in the model.
The pressure resulted from the bolts locking
was simulated by loading on the six hollow
circular areas on the surface of the end plates.
Since only the relative deformations and
pressure distributions of the flow-channel
plates caused by the bolts locking sequences
will be studied in this work and elastic
deformations were assumed, the actual loading
on each bolt is not important. So, a pressure of
1 Mpa was chosen as the applied loading on
each bolt for the following numerical
simulations.
Figure 2. Finite element model
All the degrees of freedom of a central
circular area with 0.5 mm radius on interfacial
contact area of GDLs were fixed, and rest of
the interfacial contact areas of GDLs were
fixed on Z-component deformation. The
contact element 170 and contact element 174
[11] were applied between the end plate and
the flow-channel plate, also were applied
between the flow-channel plate and the gas
diffusion layer. The contact elements 170 and
174 can maintain contact behavior between
two adjacent layers when the cell was
deformed. All components of the layers neither
passed through the contact elements nor glued
to each other. The glue command [12], which
in ANSYS, could let the two different
components to share a same node, line or area.
The gasket and gas diffusion layer were
simulated as they were glued together (Figure
1).

shown in Figure 4, will be discussed in each
simulated cases.

Figure 4. The 20 lines for discussions
Figure 5 shows a typical analytical result
of the displacements of one line. Considering
the deformation of Z-component in the chart,
let D2 be the max displacement of the line, and
D1, D3 be the displacements at both ends of the
line. Then one can define W12 and W23 as W12
= (D2-D1) / (d2-d1) and W23 = (D2-D3) / (d2-d3),
respectively. The warp value of each line, W,
was defined as the maximum value between
W12 and W23 of each line. Let Wmax and Wmin
be denoted as the maximum and minimum
warp values of the 20 lines, respectively, of the
flow-channel plate, then the uniformity of the
deformations of the flow-channel plate, WR,
was defined as WR = Wmax / Wmin. The value of
WR more approach to unit, the flow-channel
plate deformed more even.
Table 2 shows the results of simulation
for all bolts locking sequences of every locking
modes. The uniformity of the deformations of
the flow-channel plate, WR, corresponding to
each locking sequence is shown in the table.
Also, the warp values, W, along lines S5 and S6
are shown in the table since they are related to
the deformation of the serpentine
flow-channel.
By comparing the resulted variations,
which are shown in the Table 2, between
different sequences of every locking modes, it
can be concluded that, for diagonal, clockwise,
and counterclockwise modes, changing the
bolts locking sequence might affect the
deformation patterns of the flow-channel plate
significantly. However, for horizontal and
vertical locking modes, the bolts locking
sequence is insignificant.
The previous discussions focused on the
influences of bolts locking sequence on the
deformations of the flow-channel plate
subjected to same bolts locking mode. In order
to study the influences of different bolts
locking modes, the values of WR in the Table 2
were examined. From Table 2, it can be
concluded that the diagonal, clockwise, and
vertical modes resulted in more even
deformations of the flow-channel plates than
counterclockwise and horizontal modes. Also,
the worst deformation uniformity of the
flow-channel plate resulted from the horizontal
bolts locking mode
Figure 5. The result of displacements
6usually occurred at the flow-channel region no
matter what are the bolts locking modes and
sequences. It means that the pressure
distribution on the flow-channel region is
smaller than the pressure distribution on the
rest portions of the flow-channel plate.
By comparing the uniformity
variations of the pressure distribution, which
are shown in the Table 3, between different
locking sequences of every different locking
modes, it can be concluded that changing the
bolts locking sequence might affect the
uniformity of the pressure distribution of the
flow-channel plate significantly if the locking
modes are diagonal, clockwise, horizontal and
vertical bolts locking modes. However, for, the
counterclockwise bolts locking modes, bolts
locking sequences are insignificant. Also,
among the five different bolts locking mode,
the most even pressure distribution resulted
from the counterclockwise locking mode.
3.3 Experimental Verification
In order to verify the simulated results
of pressure distribution in this study, the
experimental results shown in reference [14]
was adopted for comparison. The FEM model
and numerical simulation for the experimental
micro-fuel cell was executed. The
z-component normal stresses obtained from
the numerical simulation and the experimental
study were compared. The percentage error
was within the range of 10% to 30%.
4. Conclusions
In this study, the variations of the
deformation mode and pressure distribution of
the flow-channel plat in a micro-PEM fuel cell
assembly subjected to different bolts locking
sequences was studied by using FEM
simulation. Five different bolts locking modes,
including the diagonal mode, the clockwise
mode, the counterclockwise mode, the
horizontal mode, and the vertical mode, were
adopted. In each mode, the effects of three or
four different locking sequences were
investigated. For certain locking modes, the
simulated results showed that changing the
bolts locking sequence might affect the
deformation patterns and the uniformity of the
pressure distribution of the flow-channel plate
significantly.

Abstract 
In this study, the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of thin film, which was a MEMS product, were determined 
by using digital image correlation (DIC) technique and inverse approach. Firstly, a loading frame was designed to fix 
the thin film and let the thin film subjected to out-of-plane displacements. Then, the displacement fields were 
measured by using DIC technique. In order to measure the out-of-plane displacement field, a new formula for 
calculating DIC three-dimensional displacement field was developed by using the concept of coordinate 
transformation. Finally, by combining the measured displacement fields, finite element method, and optimization 
technique, the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the thin film can be determined through the inverse approach. 
By comparing the result obtained from the proposed approach with the result obtained from the nano-indentor, the 
error was within 10%. However, the corresponding cost of the proposed approach was much lower than the 
corresponding cost of the nano-indentor.  
Key Words: thin film; Young’s modulus; Poisson’s ratio; digital image correlation; inverse approach 
 
1. Introduction  
The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are important mechanical properties of the MEMS product-thin films. 
Conventionally, those mechanical properties were determined by using nano-indentor [1, 2, 3]. However, 
nano-indentor is an expensive instrument. So, in this study, a cheaper system for determining mechanical properties 
was proposed. Digital image correlation (DIC) technique, finite element method (FEM), and inverse approach were 
adopted in the proposed system.    
DIC technique was first proposed by Peters and Ranson [4] in 1982. They used DIC to observe deformed object. 
Continually, Sutton et al. [5] used interpolation to calculate gray values of obtained images. Chu et al. [6] studied the 
applications of the DIC technique to experimental mechanics. Suttons et al. [7] proposed that there were three 
important factors which can improve the analysis precision of DIC in 1988. By applying DIC to measure 
three-dimensional displacement fields were performed by many researchers [8, 9, 10] since 1987. In this study, a set 
of easier equations, by using the concept of coordinate transformation, for determining three-dimensional 
displacement fields by applying DIC was introduced.  
 
2. Theory  
2.1 Proposed Method for Determining Mechanical Properties of a Thin Film 
     The corresponding flow-chart of the proposed method for determining mechanical properties of a thin film was 
shown as in Figure 1. Firstly, a loading frame was designed to fix the thin film and let the thin film subjected to 
out-of-plane displacements. Then, the displacement fields were measured by using DIC technique. Finally, by

By utilizing the DIC technique, (du1, dv1) and (du2, dv2) can be obtained from the images taken by the CCD 
cameras at position1 and position 2, respectively. It should be noted that dv1 = dv2 = dv since position 1 and position 2 
are located at the same X-Z plane. Then the values of du and dw can be determined from the values of du1 and du2 
by as shown in the following.

3. Experimental Results and Discussions 
3.1 Experiment for Validity 
     In order to test the validity of equations (5) and (6), a loaded cantilever beam was chosen as shown in Figure 
5. 
 
     
                 (A)                                        (B) 
Figure 5: Loaded cantilever beam 
 
The beam shown in the Figure 5 is 106.3 mm of length (from the fixed end to the free end), 11.1 mm of height, and 2.1 
mm of thickness. At a location 20 mm from the free end, a load of 6.5 N was applied on the beam along the negative 
Y-axis direction. Simultaneously, at the same location, a load of 0.29 N was applied on the top face of the beam along 
the negative Z-axis direction. The displacement fields of three points on the surface of the beam were measured by 
both holographical interferometry and DIC with equations (5) and (6). As shown in the Figure 6, all three points were 
located on the X-axis and the spacing between any two adjacent points was 18 mm and 22 mm.

Figure 8: Experimental arrangement of thin film experiment  
 
In the experiment shown in the Figure 8, angle θ was chosen as 30o and angle ϕ was chosen as 15o. 1 cm of 
obtained image contains 430 pixels, so the minimum in-plane and out-of-plane displacements which can be 
detected were about 5 μm and 20 μm, respectively. The out-of-plane displacements, dwA, dwB, and dwC, of three 
points, A, B, and C, respectively, on the thin film were chosen to determine the Young’s modulus, E, and Poisson’s 
ratio, ν, of the thin film by using the proposed method shown in the Figure 1. The coordinates of points A, B, and C 
are (7, 0, 0) mm, (9, 0, 0) mm, and (11, 0, 0) mm, respectively. Table 2 shows the DIC experimental results.

-54.385 -65.977 -78.908 
 
For any given values of E and ν, the out-of-plane displacements of points A, B, and C can be obtained by using 
FEM also. Let dwA’, dwB’, and dwC’ be the out-of-plane displacements of points A, B, and C, respectively, obtained by 
utilizing FEM. By setting the objective function, F(E,ν), as  
 
F(E,ν) = (dwA – dwA’)2 + (dwB – dwB’)2 +(dwC – dwC’)2     (7) 
 
The actual values of Young’s modulus, EA, and Poisson’s ratio, νA, of the thin film can be determined through 
the flow chart shown in the Figure 1.
