formation. In our previous studies,15–17) a computer-aided
analysis system was developed to simulate the formation,
ejection, and impact of the droplet on the substrate for a
piezoelectric inkjet printing device. The numerical model
was also validated by comparing the simulated results with
experimental observations/measurements. The simulated
results are rather consistent with the experimental observa-
tions in terms of droplet morphology, break-up time, ﬂying
distance, and droplet volume. We also studied the eﬀects of
ink properties including viscosity and surface tension and
operational characteristics including pressure wave shape
and cavity length on the formation of liquid droplets.
According to the literatures mentioned, the ﬂow behavior
of inkjet printing process depends strongly on print-head
design, operating parameters and ﬂuid properties. The
parametric studies have been performed by mathematical
model or experimental observation in many previous works.
To authors’ knowledge, few of literature are focused on how
the actuating pressure wave aﬀects the droplet behavior in
ejection process. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
present numerical experimental results for a piezoelectric
inkjet printing process and study the eﬀects of the individual
component of the actuating pressure wave conditions,
including the positive and negative amplitudes of pressure
wave, operating time, and acceleration of positive pressure
on the formation and ﬂying of liquid droplet. The quality of
droplets is evaluated by indices of the satellites separating
from a main droplet, the shape and volume as well as velocity
of droplets during ejection.
2. Mathematical Model
Because of the complexities involved, transient initial
value problems and ﬁnite deformation of a liquid-gas
interface, which describe a droplet ejection process, the
numerical calculation should then be capable of dealing
with the free surface ﬂow, tracking the interface location,
imposing the eﬀects of surface tension and handling the
complicated boundary conditions. In this study, a three-
dimensional numerical approach comprising of the Volume-
Of-Fluid (VOF)18) method for tracking the interface location
and the Continuum Surface Force (CSF)19) method for
modeling the eﬀects of surface tension is employed.
2.1 Governing equations
The most inks used in inkjet printing are dilute polymer
solutions in water. Their viscosity is a weak function of
shear rate and consequently can be approximated by a
Newtonian (constant viscosity) ﬂuid. Like most liquids these
inks are also incompressible. The equations of motion can
be written in the form of the Navier-Stokes equations as
following.

Where  (kgm3) is density;  (Pas) is viscosity; P (Pa) is
pressure ﬁeld; ~V (ms1) is the velocity ﬁeld; ~Fb (N) is the
body force; ~g (ms2) is the acceleration due to gravity.
The velocity ~V is constrained by the continuity equation
(conservation of mass), which, for an incompressible ﬂow,
takes the form
r  ~V ¼ 0 ð2Þ
2.2 Treatments for the free surface ﬂow
Three crucial problems in modeling free surface ﬂows
are how to estimate the free surface location, monitor the
evolution of the ﬂuid domain and handle the free surface
boundary conditions. In this study, a Volume-of-Fluid (VOF)
interface tracking method, which was developed by Nichols
and Hirt,18) is adapted to represent the ﬂuid domain and to
track the evolution of its free boundaries.
With the VOF method, a ﬁeld variable, Fðx; y; z; tÞ, is
designated to each computational element to indicate the
volume fraction of liquid in that particular cell. When F is
equal to 1, it means the cell is full of liquid. When F is
equal to 0, it means the cell is full of gas (or empty of liquid).
When F is between 0 and 1, the element contains both liquid
and gas and an interface is then allocated in that particular
cell. Thus, the F value can indicate the domain of ﬂuid ﬂow
and it is a step function. From the law of mass conservation,
the volume fraction of ﬂuid, F, is governed by the following
equation:
@F
@t
þ ð ~V  rÞF ¼ 0 ð3Þ
As the ﬂow ﬁeld (u; v;w) is known, it can update F according
to eq. (3). Thus, it can get new conﬁguration and distribution
of ﬂuid. However, if this equation is solved by using regular
ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, F is soon smeared due to numerical
diﬀusion and interfaces are no longer sharp. Furthermore,
liquid volume may not be conserved exactly and therefore,
must be treated by other methods.
When dealing with the advection of F, the interface in
a surface cell must be constructed to provide the correct
F value transported. A number of techniques have been
proposed to maintain a well deﬁned interface within the
volume fraction framework. The well known SLIC (Simple
Line Interface Calculation) method20) was developed to deal
with the interface position in earlier works. The original
SLIC method approximates the interface in each mesh cell
as a line parallel to one of the coordinate axes in a two-
dimensional analysis. The interface representation using
SLIC is obviously very rough. However, it has been adopted
in many problems, especially when less deformation was
involved. The PLIC (Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation)
method, which was developed by Youngs,21) gave a useful
reﬁnement to the SLIC method with the use of a straight line
to approximate the interface within each computational cell.
The direction of the straight line is determined by the liquid
volumes in that particular cell and its neighboring cells.
The PLIC22–24) method is adopted and then coupled with
the VOF method in this study. It approximates the interface
by a plane, where the orientation is properly determined,
within each computational cell. Once the interface is
constructed or reconstructed, its motion by the velocity ﬁeld
must be modeled by a suitable advection algorithm. This can
be achieved by either an Eulerian or a Lagrangian scheme.

observation of the droplet ejection behaviors caused by a
single or a double voltage pulse is successfully explained
through the propagation of acoustic pressure waves.25,26)
During positive pressure period, the meniscus at the nozzle
exit is formed and then a jet is created. The ejected liquid
is separated from nozzle when the negative pressure is
applied.
The pressure waveform at the nozzle inlet, as shown in
Fig. 3, is imposed in this study to discuss the eﬀects of
pressure parameters on the droplet ejection. The positive
pressure is imposed in the duration of 0 to tp, and the negative
pressure wave is imposed during tp to tn. The breakup of
droplet is most occurred in the period of tp to tn. No more
pressure wave is applied after tn. The pressure pulse
parameters tested in this work are amplitude, operating time
and accelerated rate, as shown in Table 1. The baseline is as
the standard case and compares with the other 8 cases. The
inﬂuence of (1) the positive pressure amplitude (Pmax), (2) the
negative pressure amplitude (Pmin), (3) the total operating
time (to ¼ tr1 þ tf1 þ tr2 þ tf2), (4) acceleration of the posi-
tive pressure (ap ¼ Pmax=tr1) on ejection behavior are
discussed. The ap is deﬁned as 1 for the baseline. Therefore,
the ap values for the case 7 and case 8 are 2 and 2/3
respectively.
Three diﬀerent mesh systems, 4848200, 6060250
and 7272300, were evaluated for the baseline as shown in
Figs. 4–6. During droplet formation period (at 16 and 32 ms),
the droplet shapes and velocities of these three systems are
almost the same. From 54 to 102 ms, the droplet shapes and
velocities of the 6060250 and 7272300 systems are
consistence, but are diﬀerent from the 4848200 system.
After 138 ms, the velocity of the satellite droplet of the
6060250 system is diﬀerent from the 7272300
system, but the droplet shape and velocity of the main
droplet are consistence. Therefore, the simulation system is
divided into a uniform as well as rectangular mesh system of
6060250. The simulated results are shown in Figs. 7–14.
The cross-section views at center plane of modeling area
are presented by a sequence of pictures to show the droplet
morphology and velocity contour. From a close examination
of the droplet ejection sequences, it can be divided into two
stages, droplet formation process and droplet ﬂying process.
During droplet formation period, the ink is pushed out and the
meniscus forms at nozzle exit. After breakup from nozzle
exit, the droplet changes shape, ﬂies and hits on the substrate
during ﬂying sequences. The pictures (a)–(c) in each ﬁgure
show three sequences of drop formation at time instants of
0:5tp (a), tp (b) and breakup time (c). The pictures (d)–(g) in
each ﬁgure show the sequences of drop separating from the
nozzle exit, ﬂying and hitting on substrate. The picture (d)
is at time instant of stopping applied pressure (time ¼ tn),
and (g) is at time when drop hits on substrate. The pictures
of (e) and (f) are the ﬂying instants chosen at equi-interval
between (d) and (g).

3.1 Droplet formation process
3.1.1 Droplet formation process of the baseline case
Time evolution of the droplet shape together with velocity
contours in the ﬂuid is depicted in Fig. 5 for the baseline
case. As time progresses after the pressure is applied, the
liquid ejected out of nozzle exit gradually changes its shape
from a meniscus to a teat-shape droplet. In the period of tr1
from 0 to 16 ms, the accelerated positive pressure is applied
on the inlet of nozzle and the liquid is ejected at the exit of
nozzle. The shape of the liquid is like a meniscus as shown in
Fig. 5(a). In tf1 from 16 to 32 ms, the positive pressure reduces
from Pmax to 0, still keeps exerting its eﬀect on the liquid, and
a droplet with column tail forms, as shown in Fig. 5(b). This
shape is formed because the ejected liquid has a higher
velocity at the drop tip than that at the nozzle exit. In the time
period of 32 to 64 ms (tr2 þ tf2), the negative pressure is
applied and the liquid near the exit is aﬀected by both the
upward pulling force and downward inertia force. Then,
necking of the ejected liquid occurs at the tip of the nozzle.
At around 54 ms in this case, the liquid’s forward inertia
momentum overcomes the opposed eﬀects of surface tension
and viscous force, and a droplet breakup is observed with a
tailing droplet, as shown in Fig. 5(c). In other words, the
ejected ink separates from the nozzle exit. During the droplet
ﬂying process (Fig. 5(d)–(g)), the droplet undergoes shape
ﬂuctuation and reaches the print media.
3.1.2 Inﬂuence of Pmax on the droplet formation process
The eﬀect of the positive pressure amplitude Pmax on the
droplet formation is illustrated in pictures (a)–(c) of Figs. 7, 5
and 8 with Pmax ¼ 0:03, 0.05, and 0.07MPa, respectively.
It is found that the breakup time is 52, 54 and 54 ms, and the
corresponding length of the broken liquid column is 128, 224
and 296 mm. The breakup time is not changed obviously
with the positive pulse amplitude Pmax under the same tp, tn
and Pmin. However, the tail length and velocity of droplet
increases with an increase in Pmax. Tail length and velocity
increase with applied pressure due to the fact that at higher
pressure amplitude, a larger force acts on the ink in the nozzle
and therefore drop velocity increases.
3.1.3 Inﬂuence of Pmin on the droplet formation process
The pictures (a)–(c) in Figs. 9 and 10 present the droplet
formation for Pmin ¼ 0:01 and 0.04MPa at constant other
parameters (Pmax ¼ 0:05, to ¼ 64 ms and ap ¼ 1). Comparing
with Fig. 5(a)–(c), it is found that the breakup time decreases
from 58, 54 to 52 ms when the Pmin increases from
Pmin ¼ 0:01, 0.025 to 0.04MPa, and the corresponding
lengths of the broken liquid column are 244, 224 and
216 mm, respectively. The amplitude of the negative pressure
aﬀects the breakup time of the liquid column. The lager Pmin
induces larger upward pulling force and results in the
tendency of the shorter breakup time and the shorter length
of the liquid column. No apparent diﬀerence is observed in
the drop velocity with changes in Pmin.
3.1.4 Inﬂuence of to on the droplet formation process
The pictures (a)–(c) in Figs. 11 and 12 show the sequences
of droplet formation at pulse length to ¼ 48 and 32 ms.
Comparing with Fig. 5(a)–(c), it is found that the breakup
time decreases from 54, 46 to 34 ms when the total operating
time decreases from to ¼ 64, 48 to 32 ms, and the corre-
sponding lengths of the broken liquid column are 224, 180
and 120 mm, respectively. The length of droplet tail increases
with to because of the increasing of the width of the positive
pressure. Mostly, the breakup time of droplet occurs in the
period of tp-tn, negative pressure applying. However, in the
case 6, the droplet separates from nozzle exit at 34 ms, longer
than tn (¼ 32 ms) as shown in Fig. 12(c)–(d).
3.1.5 Inﬂuence of ap on the droplet formation process
Pictures (a)–(c) in Figs. 5, 13 and 14 show the sequences
of droplet formation for ap ¼ 1, 2 and 2/3. Comparing
pictures (a) and (b) in Figs. 5, 13 and 14, it is observed that
the velocity in Fig. 11 (ap ¼ 2) is highest at 16 ms and slowest
at 32 ms than others because of the positive pressure reaching
maximum value in shortest time (tr1 ¼ 8 ms), and the smallest
positive pressure during 16–32 ms. As seen in the simulation

Generally, the higher droplet velocity could improve the
process throughput, but accompanies the larger droplet
volume, which decreases the process resolution. Comparing
the case 1 with the case 5, both ones possess smaller droplet
volume, but only the case 5 can also obtain higher droplet
velocity.
4. Conclusion
In this study, a fully three-dimension and multi-ﬂuid ﬂows
computational system is established to simulate the liquid
ejection process in a piezoelectric inkjet print-head. The
numerical experiments are performed by replacing pulse
voltage with a pressure waveform. The inﬂuence of pressure
pulse parameters, such as positive pressure amplitude,
negative pressure amplitude, operating period and acceler-
ation of pressure on droplet ejection is presented. The major
results taken from simulation are summarized as follows:
(1) Increasing the amplitude of the positive pressure Pmax
could cause the longer tail length, faster droplet velocity
and larger droplet volume. The eﬀect of the amplitude
of positive pressure on break-up time is not obvious.
(2) Increasing the amplitude of the negative pressure Pmin
could result in a shorter tail length, shorter breakup time
and smaller droplet volume. No apparent diﬀerence is
observed in the droplet velocity with changes in Pmin.
(3) The tail length, velocity and volume of droplet would
increase with increase of pressure pulse operating time
to.
(4) Increasing the acceleration of the positive pressure ap
would cause the longer tail length, faster droplet
velocity and larger droplet volume.
