Abstract 
A strong blue photoluminescence emission at 450 nm was observed from alumina films 
prepared from the alumina precursor. Photoluminescence measurement indicates the peak 
intensity of the blue emission changes with the pH value of the peptizing solution, annealing 
temperature, and atmosphere. The blue emission appears at a low temperature of 50°C and 
reaches a maximum strength at 400oC and 600oC in oxygen atmosphere and nitrogen 
atmospheres, respectively.  HRTEM image shows the alumina films are composed of 
nanoparticles with a diameter about 8-10 nm. It is believed that the observed strong 
photoluminescence is associated with inherent defect centers in the material, which are related 
to the structure transition and transformation from boehmite phase to γ-alumina phase and 
bond cleavage.

boehmite and gibbsite phases. At a higher pH solution, i.e. larger than 9, both phases of 
boehmite and bayerite were detected [16]. However, there has not yet been a complete 
investigation on blue light-emitting alumina nanoparticles and films, including the associated 
phase transformation and fluorescent mechanisms contained therein. In addition, it was 
believed that the photoluminescence and characterization behaviors of the PL band for 
alumina nanoparticles seem strongly depend on the structural transition and inherent defect 
centers in the material. 
In this work, a simple method of combining the aqueous solution process with a thermal 
treatment is proposed to develop Al2O3 films with strong blue emission. The effect of thermal 
treatment and pH value on structure development and optical properties of alumina films on 
Si wafer will be investigated. The easy and convenient route to synthesize alumina films 
demonstrates a new way to develop nanostructures for optoelectronic applications. 
 
2. Experimental  
Aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3‧9H2O) was dissolved in deionized water. The hydroxide was 
co-precipitated in NH4OH solution at pH=10 and then washed several times with deionized 
water to remove unreacted ammonia and nitrate. The precipitate was then peptized to form a 
precursor solution with the pH value adjusted at 2 and 6. Subsequently, the precursor was 
deposited on a Si wafer by dipping process to fabricate alumina thin film and then dried at 50 
oC. The samples were then rapidly annealed at different temperatures in air, oxygen, nitrogen 
When the samples were annealed at 400°C for 1 hour, γ-alumina started to be developed from 
the alumina nanoparticles [18]. As the annealing temperature was raised above 400 °C, the 
phase of the alumina nanoparticles gradually transformed from γ-alumina to θ-alumina. 
Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the alumina nanoparticles annealed from 400 to 800 
°C for 1 hour. It can be observed that the broad peak at 3300 to 3600 cm-1significantly 
decreases as a higher annealing temperature is used. This decreased broad peak corresponds 
to a decreasing concentration of hydroxyl bonds as the annealing temperature is increased, 
which is due to the phase transformation from pseudo-boehmite to γ-alumina, and then later 
to α-alumina. A sufficiently high annealing temperature provides sufficient energy for the 
hydroxyl bond to break. The broad peak at 1650 cm-1 corresponds to the concentration of 
water molecules in the alumina nanoparticles. Similarly, this peak decreases as the annealing 
temperature is increased. The broad peak at the 500 to 1000 cm-1 range corresponds to 
different coordinates of the Al-O bonding. The nearby peaks at 800 to 1000 cm-1 are 
attributed to the four coordinates of Al-O. The broad peak near 600 cm-1 is due to the six 
coordinates of Al-O. In general, the γ-alumina coordinates is composed of four and six 
coordination but the boehmite structure may be six coordinated aluminum. From Fig. 2, the 
phase transition of the alumina nanoparticles from boehmite to γ-aluminum is clearly 
described by the transitioning of peaks corresponding to six coordinates, to peaks 
corresponding to four coordinates. Figure 3 shows the TEM image of the alumina films 
prepared from precursor with pH value of 2 annealed at 200oC. The TEM micrograph in Fig. 
Fig. 5(a) shows the PL spectra of alumina films fabricated from the pH=2 precursor sols 
and then annealed at 50 to 800 °C in oxygen environment. As depicted by Fig. 5(a), a PL 
spectrum at a wavelength of 450 nm was detected for as-deposited alumina films at 50oC. 
With increasing temperature to 400oC, as dehydration proceeds, the structure evolves through 
a series of disordered states during the phase transformation from pseudo-boemite to γ-phase 
as demonstrated in Fig. 1. In this condition, it was believed that a certain transient phase 
exists between six-coordinate pseudo-boehmite structure and four-coordinate γ-phase 
structure, which causes five-coordinated aluminum sites and singly ionized oxygen vacancies 
(F+ center) generated. Therefore, an ultra-strong blue emission could be observed. At a higher 
temperature, i.e. 600oC, although the positions of the blue emission remain unchanged, it was 
found that the peak intensity is weakened compared to that annealed at 400oC. This indicates 
the defect density of the main defects (F+ centers) responsible for blue emission is decreased 
with increasing annealing temperature up to 600oC. It means that the F+ centers would be 
reduced due to compensation in O2 atmosphere.  At a higher annealing temperature above 
600oC, the compensation from oxygen atmosphere is more apparent and the phase 
transformation from γ to θ was induced, which not only leads the reduction of the F+ center 
but also the disappearance of the blue emission for the samples annealed above 800°C.  
Furthermore, it was noted that the blue emission of post-annealed alumina films is not only 
dominated by the annealing temperature but also the annealing atmosphere because the PL 
emission is very sensitive to defect type.12 As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), when the alumina films

In the ZnO synthesis process, a chrysanthemum-like precursor of Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2.was firstly produced by
hydrothermal reaction using zinc acetate dihydrate and urea as reactants. After calcining, the Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2
decomposed and converted into flake-like, porous-structured ZnO powders with nanorystallites. Two obvious
emission peaks, a narrow near-UV emission (located at ~380 nm) and a broad green one (centered at ~500 nm),
were observed in all the room temperature photoluminescence spectra of the as-synthesized ZnO powders. Both
product’s crystalline size and the intensity ratio of the UV emission-to-green emission could be affected by several
experimental parameters, i.e., the hydrothermal time, calcining temperature and calcining time.

calcination to form ZnO. Depending on the experimental parameters, it is expected that the resulting
ZnO would show various properties such as the crystalline size, the photoluminescence nature, etc.
The Taguchi method, which is a combination of mathematical and statistics techniques used in an
empirical study, 5, 6 was thus introduced in this work to identify the optimal conditions and to select
the parameters having the most principlal influence on the crystallite size and the optical properties
of the resulting ZnO products.
The objectives of this work are: (1) to examine the formation mechanism of nanocrystalline
ZnO powders synthesized by the proposed route, (2) to apply the Taguchi method to evaluate the
effects of experimental parameters on the crystalline size and the optical properties of the resulting
ZnO products, and (3) to optimize the experimental parameters and to perform the verification
experiment using the optimal conditions.
2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
The precursor was firstly prepared by the following hydrothermal route: 0.05 mol zinc acetate
dihyrate and 0.1 mol urea were dissoloved in 100 ml de-ioned water at room temperature to from a
clear solution. Then, the mixed solution was transferred into a Telfon-lined autoclave of 120 ml and
sealed securely. The solutions contained in the autoclave were heated in a electronic furnace at a
temperature of 120 ℃ for 2-4 h. It was quenched to stop the reaction using cold water. The
precursor was centrifugalized, washed 2 times with de-ioned water, and then dried in a vacuum
oven at 25 ℃ for 12 h. The disired products, ZnO, were obtained by calcining the dired procusors
in a muffle furnace at 350-650 ℃ for 0.5-2 h. An orthogonal array of L9 (34) was adopted for the
design of experiments of synthesizing ZnO nanoparticles. Three parameters with three levels are
contained in nine experiments,7 as shown in left-side of Table 1. Measured properties were
performed on three samples and then averaged as mean.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a SIEMENZ D-5000 X-ray diffractometr
with Cu-Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). The crystalite size was estimated using the Scherer 
formula.8 Morphology features of samples were observed with scanning electron microscpe (SEM,
Joel JSM-T330A) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi H-7100). Simultaneous
analyses of the thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the
as-obtained precipitations were carried out at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in air by using a thermal
analyzer (NETZSCH, Instruments 404). At the same time, the gas escaping form the TG-DSC cell
was analyzed with a mass spectrometer (NETZSCH, QMS Skimmer). Photoluminescence (PL)
spectra of the powders as-synthesized were measured at room temperature using HeCd laser (λ=325 
nm) as excitation source.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. PRODUCT CHARACTERIZATIONS AND REACTION MECHANISM
Fig. 1 shows the typical results of simultaneous TG-DSC analyses of the precursor. There were
two stages of weight loss lying in the temperatures ranges of 200-290 ℃ and 310-350 ℃,
respectively. The obvious endothermic peak centered at ~250 ℃ on DSC curve, accompanying
with a significant weight loss of ~25% and the abundant release of H2O and CO2 gases (as analyzed
by MS), could be attributed to the thermal decomposition of the precursor. The other minor
exothermic reaction occurred between 300 and 350 ℃, which may correspond to the oxidation of
residual organic/carbonaceous matters in the precursor as evidenced by the slight weight loss of ~2
% and the detected escapes gases of CO2 and H2O.
Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of the precipitating precursor, which is consistent with that of
JCPDS file No. 19-1458. It was thus proved that the precursor is basic zinc carbonate with the
chemical composition of Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2. After the precursors were respectively calcined at 350
℃ for 0.5 h, 500℃ for 1 h, and 650 ℃ for 2 h, all the as-obtained powder had the same phase
composition of wurtzite ZnO with P63mc structure (JCPDS 36-1451) and their crystallite size were
estimated to be ~15, 24, and 46 nm, respectively (Fig. 2(b)-(d)).
optimum conditions for optimizing the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles with smaller crystalline size
and better crystalline quality (i.e., a larger Ri value) The former is the characteristic type of
“smaller-the-better”while the latter belongs to the“larger-the-better”response. Their S/N ratios are
respectively defined as
)log(10)(/ 2ydBratioNS  and )1log(10)(/ 2ydBratioNS 
where y is the mean of measured property. Both the average crystalline size and the average Ri
value of ZnO particles prepared by the various conditions of parameter design are presented in
right-side of Table 1. Their corresponding S/N ratios can thus be calculated by the above equations,
separately. The average S/N ratio for each parameter at each level and the range of S/N ratio for
each parameter are then determined. Fig. 5 shows the S/N ratio response graph of S/N ratios for
“smaller-the-better”of crystalline size and for “larger-the-better”of Ri value. It is known that, the
larger the S/N ratio, the larger the contribution of one experimental parameter at that level for the
object of function. Moreover, the larger the slope of connected line of S/N ratios, the larger the
effect of the parameter on the object of function. Therefore, the best conditions for the crystalline
size are: 0.5 h of hydrothermal time, 350 ℃ of calcining temperature and 1 h of calcining time;
whereas those for the Ri value are: 4 h of hydrothermal time, 500 ℃ of calcining temperature and
2 h of calcining time. The calcining time has the most important influence on the crystalline size
while the calcining temperature has the first impact on the Ri value. However, the hydrothermal
time seems to be relatively indifferent to the crystalline size and the Ri value as compared with the
other two parameters. The variation range of S/N ratio in hydrothermal time is much small, so it
could be neglected and regarded as an error variance. Based on our experimental experiences, it was
found that the formation of the precursor was enhanced with the increase of hydrothermal time and
thereby increased the yield of ZnO product. (Note that the product yield is limited mainly due to
uncompleted reactions/chemical equilibrium in hydrothermal treatment. The washing process may
also cause product loss, but not to affect the reproductivity in this work.)
In order to prepare the ZnO powders with the coexisting characters of smaller crystalline size
and larger Ri value, the calcining temperature and the calcining time were selected to be 500 ℃
and 1 h, respectively. That is because the experimental condition of 500 ℃ could give rise to the
largest S/N ratio (9.83) for the Ri value and the greatest variance
(Δ=delta=S/Nmax-S/Nmin=9.83-(-7.88)=17.71) in the Ri value as well (see Fig. 5). Furthermore, the
adoption of the other experimental condition, 1 h, instead of 2 h, was a compromise to avoid the
over-growth of ZnO crytallites and to obtain an acceptable Ri value (see Fig. 5). On the other hand,
single-factor experiment was carried out to investigate the correlation among the hydrothermal time,
the product yield, the crystalline size and the Ri value. As evidenced in Table 2, increase of the
hydrothermal time indeed enhances the product yield substantially. Considering experimental
economics, four hours was thus selected as the appropriate level for the hydrothermal time, though
the resultant product’s properties were just close to the superlative ones (i.e, the smalest crystaline 
size and the largest Ri value). It is thus suggested that, 4 h of hydrothermal time, 500 ℃ of
calcining temperature and 1 h of calcining time, are the optimal conditions in this work. The
confirmation experiment has been preformed and the yield as well as the product properties is listed
in Table 2. Judging from the TEM observation (see Fig. 6), the actual crystalline size of the
resulting ZnO nanoparticles synthesized with the optimal conditions was estimated to be ~25 nm,
which agrees well with the experimental result obtained by the X-ray line-broadening technique.
The actual Ri value of 4.54 obtained at the optimal conditions (see Table2) is better than those of
most experiments shown in Table 1. Consequently, it is confirmed that the crystalline size and the Ri
value (i.e., the crystalline quality) of the synthesized ZnO powders can concurrently be reduced and
improved acceptably with the Taguchi method. Meanwhile, a product yield of ~70% could be
attained under the optimal conditions.

Abstract: Fine-powders of hard-magnetic SrFe12O19 incorporated with high-dielectric SrTiO3 (up
to 15 mol%), which are being investigated as a potential material for microwave absorbers, were
synthesized simultaneously in one step through a solution combustion reaction using nitrates and
glycine as reactants. The desired products, simply composed of SrFe12O19 and SrTiO3, could be
obtained after calcation of the as-burned nanocrystalline products at 900 ℃ for 1 h. The effects of
the SrTiO3 content on the relative complex permittivity ( "'  jr  ), permeability ( "'  jr  ) and
the behavior of microwave absorption in the frequency range of 1 MHz-1.8 GHz have been
investigated. Adding more SrTiO3 to SrFe12O19 was demonstrated not only to improve the r but
also to modify the r. Besides, it was found that the sintered specimens showed a characterstic of
broad-band absorption and their absorbing efficiency were enhanced with increasing SrTiO3
content.

1. INTRODUCTION
Strontium ferrite (SrFe12O19) is an M-type hexagonal ferrite, which has been well-established as a
high performance permanent magnetic material and is widely being used to develop new
applications such as high-density perpendicular recording media, injection-molded pieces,
multilayer chip inductor (MLCI) production, microwave absorbers, and so on.1 Its electromagnetic
properties can be adjusted by by introducing high dielectric materials such as SrTiO3, BaTiO3,
SrxBa1-xTiO3, and so forth, 2 or incorporating with the pair of di- and tetra-valance metallic cations
such as Ni2+-Zr4+,Co2+-Ti4+ and Zn2+-Ti4+.3, 4 Recently, a number of works have also been done to

Required amounts of metallic nitrates were dissolved in deionized water firstly. Then, glycine
and NH4NO3 were also dissolved in deionized water according to the reactant composition. The
latter solution was slowly added to the former one under constant stirring. The resulting red colored
solution was and heated at ~80 ℃ and continuously stirred to thoroughly homogenize.
Consequently, a viscous reactant mixture was obtained, which was ignited afterwards to start the
combustion reaction by using mini gas burner in air. By doing so, red flame and smoke evolution
are produced, and the products left behind are voluminous and fluffy in nature.
All the as-burned products with different η values were ground and calcined at 900 ℃ for 1 h.
After grinding, the calcined powders were pressed into toroidal samples (18 mm outside diameter,
6mm inside diameter, ~2 mm thickness). Then the green compacts were sintered in air at the
temperature of 1200 ℃ for 2 h to obtain a denser sintered body.
2.2. CHARACTERIZATION
Phase formation was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD; SIEMENS D5000) using Cu-Kα radiation. The
grain size of the as-burned product was observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi, T-7100)
and the morphological feature of the sintered sample was imaged with scanning electron microscope (SEM;
Hitachi S-3000N). Qualitative elementary analysis was performed using an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM; Toei, VSM-5) was used to determine the hysteresis loops of the calcined
powders at room temperature in an operating range of ±15 kOe. Both the relative complex permeability
( "'  jr  ) and permittivity ( "'  jr  ) of the sintered samples were measured using an HP4291B
impedance/materials analyzer in the frequency range of 1M-1.8GHz. The efficiency of microwave absorption can
be represented as the reflection loss (R.L.) and calculated by the following equations:7

where Zin is the normalized input impedance related to the impedance in free space, d is the thickness of the
is intrinsically smaller than that of perovskite titanate,3 the increase of both ' and " with an increase in theη
value could be attributed to the abundance of the perovskite STO phase incorporated into the hexagonal Sr-M. On
the other hand, it is reported2 that the dielectric properties vary in the 100 MGHz-1 GHz mainly due to the
intrinsic dipole polarization and thus the relaxation peak may take place when the hopping frequency of electric
charge carriers is approximately equal to that of the externally applied AC electric field. This phenomenon is
correlated with electric domain structure, grain size and so on. Hence, it is suggested that, the better integrity and
the larger size of the Sr-M grains in the sintered body with an increased STO content may exert an influence on
the resonance behavior.
Fig. 5 illustrate the real and the imaginary parts of the relative complex permeability ( ' and ") spectra
in the frequency range of 1 MHz-1.8 GHz for the sintered samples with variousηvalue. The real part of the
relatively permeability, ', corresponds to the degree up to which the material can be magnetized under the
presence of an external magnetic field.9 The imaginary part of the relatively permeability, ", is related to the
magnetic loss and arises due to the lag of orderly alignment of magnetocrystallites vis-to-vis the alternating
magnetic field.10 The lag is ascribed to the imperfections in the crystal structure.1, 2 It was found that both the
values of ' and " increase as the STO content increases. The ferromagnetic resonance peak is present with
the resonance frequency decreasing form 1G to 400M Hz, and magnetic loss of the samples could be observed
obviously beyond 100 MHz.
Since low magnetic anisotropy is one of conditions for low coercivity and low " value,1 the experimental
results obtained agree with the expected outcomes. Fig. 6 shows the magnetic hysteresis loops of the sintered
which can be derived by using Eqs. (4) and (5). Note that the smaller the reflection loss, the better will be the
microwave absorbing efficiency. As can be seen, the absorbing efficiency enhances with increasing theηvalue
and the measuring frequency. Moreover, it is expected that all the samples may exhibit a characteristic of broad
reflection loss since the lowest point on each curve may appear beyond the range of 1 MHz-1.8 GHz.
4. CONCLUSIONS
(1) A synthesis route, derived from the aqueous solution combustion method, has been employed to prepare
the materials of Sr-M with STO additive simultaneously. Although the as-synthesized products need further
calcination, the route is simpler and more economical when compared with other methods, and can be employed
to prepare analogous materials composed of ceramic oxides.
(2) All The sintered samples are composed of Sr-M and STO. It is found that the STO additive absorbs on the
grain surface of Sr-M; moreover, the addition of STO may exert an effect to promote the growth and the integrity
of the Sr-M grains. The electromagnetic properties (i.e., r, r , and iHc) of the Sr-M can be adjusted by
incorporating an appropriate amount of STO into the Sr-M, which may be useful for other possible applications.
(3) A preliminary result presents that, the microwave-absorbing character of the sintered
speciemens were enhanced as the increases of the STO content and the measuring frequency.
Moreover, it is expected that the all of them possess a broad-band absorption behavior.
