Diversity-Combining and Error-Correction Coding
for FFH/MFSK Systems over Rayleigh Fading
Channels under Multitone Jamming
Yu-Sun Liu, Member, IEEE
Abstract—The combined application of diversity and error-
correction coding for combating multitone jamming (MTJ) in fast
frequency-hopping/M-ary frequency-shift-keying (FFH/MFSK)
systems over Rayleigh fading channels is investigated. A log-
likelihood-combining metric which requires only easy-to-obtain
system parameters for its computation is proposed. In addition,
four soft-decision coding schemes which employ the proposed
diversity-combining metric as decoding metric are considered.
An upper bound on the bit error rate of the proposed metric
is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed metric
outperforms robust metrics. Moreover, the improvement is most
substantial for low signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR). Performances
of convolutional codes and turbo codes together with either bit-
interleaving or symbol-interleaving are examined. Upper bounds
are derived for the bit error rates of the convolutional coding
schemes, and simulations are performed for all coding schemes.
The results show that significant performance improvement can
be achieved in difficult transmission conditions by changing the
interleaving method from bit-interleaving to symbol-interleaving,
but without changing the code. In particular, the symbol-
interleaved turbo coding scheme is the best among the four for
maintaining system performance at an acceptable level for most
situations.

I. INTRODUCTION
FREQUENCY-HOPPING spread-spectrum (FHSS) fre-quency shift keying (FSK) techniques have been widely
utilized in military communication systems to provide protec-
tion against jamming. A countermeasure which a jammer can
take to reduce the effectiveness of these systems is by using
intelligent jamming strategies. Partial-band noise jamming
(PBNJ) and multi-tone jamming (MTJ) are the two principal
categories of intelligent jamming strategies, among which the
n=1-band MTJ is know to cause the worst damage to system
performance [1]. In general, the effectiveness of FHSS/FSK
systems can be regained through the combined application of
diversity and error-correction coding. In this paper, we con-
sider the diversity combining strategies and coding schemes

for fast FH/M-ary FSK (FFH/MFSK) systems in the presence
of n=1-band MTJ over Rayleigh fading channels.
On the use of diversity combining, various techniques have
been studied in the literature, which fall into two categories:
diversity combining with robust metrics and diversity combin-
ing with log-likelihood metrics. The robust-metric diversity-
combining techniques, such as linear-combining [2], [3], self-
normalization-combining [1], [2], [4], product-combining [5],
[6], and clipped-combining [7], [8], can be accomplished by
computing metrics from the outputs of the matched filters.
In contrast, the computation of the log-likelihood-combining
metrics [9]–[11] requires not only the matched filter outputs
but also side information including exact knowledge of chan-
nel state in each hop (i.e., whether the hop is jammed and if so,
the identity of the jamming tone), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR), and energy of signal. While
log-likelihood-combining metrics outperform robust metrics
when side information is available, they are not applicable
when side information is not available. Note that some side
information is much more difficult to obtain than the others.
In particular, the knowledge about channel state of each hop
is especially difficult to acquire in FFH systems.
In this paper, we propose a log-likelihood-combining metric
which can be computed using only easy-to-obtain system
parameters like SNR, SJR, energy of signal, and jamming
ratio (which all are statistical averages) but not the exact
channel state of each hop. An analytical upper bound on the
bit error rate of the proposed combining metric is established.
Simulation results show that the proposed metric achieves
significantly better performance than robust metrics, and the
improvement is most prominent for low SJR where robust
metrics incur large bit error rates.
Regarding the use of error correction coding, while a large
body of literature exists for the use of error-correction coding
in FH/FSK systems for combating jamming signals, most has
focused on hard-decision coding schemes [12], [13]. Relative
few results were published for soft-decision coding. Kang
and Stark [14] and El Gamal and Geraniotis [15] studied the
performance of turbo codes in slow FH/BFSK systems under
PBNJ. In their research, a log-likelihood metric is used in the
decoder both for decoding and iterative channel estimation
purposes. They showed that the soft-decision turbo codes
seem to outperform hard-decision coding schemes. Cheun
and Stark [16] investigated the performances of convolutional
coding schemes in FFH/MFSK systems under PBNJ, in which

and 𝑍 is a zero mean complex Gaussian random variable with
𝐸(𝑍𝑍∗) = 2𝑁0. From (5), we observe that the real and imag-
inary parts of 𝑈ℓ𝑗 are independent and identically distributed
zero-mean Gaussian random variables with variance
𝛿(𝑚, 𝑗)𝐸ℎ + 𝛿ℓ 𝛿(𝑛, 𝑗)𝐸𝐽 +𝑁0. (7)
It follows that given 𝛿(𝑚, 𝑗), 𝛿ℓ, and 𝛿(𝑛, 𝑗), the envelope
detector output 𝑉ℓ𝑗 = ∣𝑈ℓ𝑗 ∣ is a Rayleigh distributed random
variable with parameter 𝜎2 equal to (7).
III. DIVERSITY-COMBINING METRICS
In this section, we consider the case that the signal is
transmitted without coding (i.e., code rate 𝑟 = 1), and the
maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver makes a hard decision
for each bit based on log-likelihood-combining metric. Let
𝑉 ℓ = (𝑉ℓ0, 𝑉ℓ1, . . . , 𝑉ℓ𝑀−1) be the output vector of the 𝑀
envelope detectors in hop ℓ, and let 𝑽 = (𝑉 1, 𝑉 2, . . . , 𝑉 𝐿)
be the output matrix of a transmitted 𝑀 -ary symbol. Based
on this output matrix, the log-likelihood-combining metric of
each bit in the symbol is computed in the receiver. In this
paper, we assume that the receiver has perfect information
about the average energy per hop 𝐸ℎ, the SNR value, the SJR
value, and the jamming ratio 𝜌. However, the receiver knows
neither whether a particular hop is jammed nor the identity of
the jamming tone.
A. Log-Likelihood-Combining Metric
The likelihood function of 𝑀 -ary symbol 𝑚 is given by
𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚) =
𝐿∏
ℓ=1
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚), (8)
as the 𝐿 output vectors of one symbol are independent
given the transmitted symbol 𝑚. Let 𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1) and
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0) denote the conditional likelihood functions
of symbol 𝑚 given that the hop is and is not jammed,
respectively. Equation (8) can be rewritten as
𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚) =
𝐿∏
ℓ=1
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1) ⋅𝜌+𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0) ⋅(1−𝜌).
(9)
Let 𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1, 𝐽 = 𝑛) denote the conditional likelihood
function given that the hop is corrupted by the jamming tone
𝑛. The conditional likelihood function 𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1) can
be expressed as
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1) = 1
𝑀
𝑀−1∑
𝑛=0
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1, 𝐽 = 𝑛) (10)
=
1
𝑀
𝑀−1∑
𝑛=0
𝑀−1∏
𝑗=0
𝑝(𝑉ℓ𝑗 ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1, 𝐽 = 𝑛)
(11)
where the last equality follows from the observation that
given the transmitted tone and the jamming tone, the outputs
of the 𝑀 envelope detectors 𝑉ℓ𝑗 , 𝑗 = 0, . . . ,𝑀 − 1, are
statistically independent. Moreover, 𝑝(𝑉ℓ𝑗 ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 1, 𝐽 = 𝑛)
is the Rayleigh probability density function with parameter
𝜎2 = 𝛿(𝑚, 𝑗)𝐸ℎ + 𝛿(𝑛, 𝑗)𝐸𝐽 +𝑁0 (12)
for all 𝑗 = 0, . . . ,𝑀 − 1, which is a direct result of (7).
Similarly, the conditional likelihood function 𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0)
can in turn be expressed as
𝑝(𝑉 ℓ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0) =
𝑀−1∏
𝑗=0
𝑝(𝑉ℓ𝑗 ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0). (13)
Moreover, 𝑝(𝑉ℓ𝑗 ∣𝑚, 𝛿ℓ = 0) is the Rayleigh probability
density function with parameter
𝜎2 = 𝛿(𝑚, 𝑗)𝐸ℎ +𝑁0. (14)
Finally, combining (9), (11), and (13), we can obtain the
likelihood function of each transmitted symbol 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚). As-
suming that all transmitted symbols are equally likely, the log-
likelihood-combining metric of each bit 𝑏 is given by
log 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑏 = 𝑐) = log 2
𝑀
∑
𝑚∈ℳ𝑐
𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚), 𝑐 = 0, 1 (15)
where ℳ𝑐 is the set of all symbols of which the bit 𝑏 equals
𝑐. The ML receiver makes a hard decision for each bit based
on maximum-log-likelihood-metric criteria using the metric in
(15).
B. Upper Bound on Bit Error Rate
We derive an upper bound on the bit error rate of the ML
receiver while ignoring the effect of the background thermal
noise (i.e., 𝑁0 = 0) and assuming that the system performance
is dominated by the jamming signal. Let 𝑃ML denote the bit
error rate of the ML receiver. Following an argument similar
to the one in [17], [18] and observing that the binary channel
for each bit is a symmetric channel, we obtain
𝑃ML =

IV. FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION WITH
LOG-LIKELIHOOD-COMBINING METRIC
For forward error correction, we consider two binary er-
ror correcting codes, convolutional code and turbo code,
together with two interleaving methods, bit-interleaving and
symbol-interleaving. In each coding scheme, the proposed
log-likelihood-combining metric is used as decoding metric.
There are totally four coding schemes with soft-decision de-
coding, bit-interleaved convolutional coding (BICC) scheme,
symbol-interleaved convolutional coding (SICC) scheme,
bit-interleaved turbo coding (BITC) scheme, and symbol-
interleaved turbo coding (SITC) scheme. The turbo code
considered here is the parallel concatenation of two identical
recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes (with code
rate 𝑟′ = 2𝑟) via a interleaver [19]. Bit-interleaving means
that binary coded sequences are first randomly interleaved
and then mapped into sequences of 𝑀 -ary MFSK symbols.
Hence, decoders of BICC and BITC schemes use the proposed
log-likelihood-combining metric of each coded bit (defined
in (15)) as bit metric in the decoding process. In contrast,
symbol-interleaving means that binary coded sequences are
first mapped into sequences of 𝑀 -ary MFSK symbols which
are then interleaved. Thus, the convolutional code in SICC
scheme can be viewed as a (1, 𝑘) convolutional code, in the
encoder of which at each instant of time, 𝑘 = 𝑟 log2𝑀
data bits are fed into the encoder, and one coded 𝑀 -
ary symbols is calculated. Therefore, the decoder of SICC
scheme uses the log-likelihood-combining metric of each 𝑀 -
ary symbol log 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚), 𝑚 = 0, . . . ,𝑀 − 1, as the joint
decoding metric of the log2𝑀 consecutive coded bits and
decodes 𝑘 data bits at each decoding step. In the encoder
of the SITC scheme in Fig. 4, the two RSC encoders are
connected via a block-interleaver in which the data sequence
is partitioned into data blocks of length 𝑘′ = 𝑟′ log2𝑀
bits before interleaving. Therefore, the data bits of a block
at the inputs remain in one block after interleaving. At the
encoder outputs, the coded sequences of both RSC encoders
are separately symbol-interleaved. At the decoder, both RSC
decoders use log 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚) as the joint metric of the log2𝑀
consecutive coded bits to obtain the joint extrinsic informa-
tions of data blocks, which in turn are used as the joint a
priori informations of data blocks in the next decoding stage
after being interleaved (or deinterleaved), as shown in Fig. 5.
The rate-1/2 and rate-1/3 convolutional codes considered in
this paper are memory six convolutional codes with octal
generators (133, 171) and (133, 165, 171), respectively. The
rate-1/3 turbo code consists of two identical rate-2/3 RSC
codes with memory four and octal generator (23, 35). Random
interleavers with length of 1920 bits are used for simulation
results; infinite-length random interleavers are assumed for
deriving theoretical upper bounds on bit error rates.
A. Upper Bound on Bit Error rate
We derive upper bounds on the bit error rates of the BICC
and SICC schemes assuming that 𝑁0 = 0. Assuming that
infinite-length random interleaver is used, each coded bit in the
BICC scheme is transmitted through a stationary memoryless
channel. We first consider the bit error rate of the BICC

rates for the two convolutional coding schemes and a RS coding scheme with

B. Simulation Results
Fig. 7 plots the simulated worst-case bit error rates of the
two convolutional coding schemes and the (60, 20) RS coding
scheme with parameters 𝑟 = 1/3, 𝑀 = 64, and 𝐿 = 3. Since
the diversity order 𝐿 is large, the BICC scheme outperforms
the SICC scheme for high SNR, as predicted by the theoretical
upper bounds. In contrast, as SNR decreases, and the identities
of the transmitted tone and jamming tone are obscured by
AWGN, the SICC scheme performs better than the BICC
scheme in the worst-case jamming. It is also observed that both
convolutional coding schemes achieve better performance than
the RS coding scheme. The obvious choice to further improve
bit error rate performance is turbo code. Fig. 8 plots the worst-
case bit error rates of the two turbo coding schemes and
two convolutional coding schemes with parameters 𝑟 = 1/3,
𝑀 = 64, 𝐿 = 3, and SNR = 5.55 dB. The value of SNR is
5.55 dB instead of 6.75 dB because at SNR = 6.75 dB, the
bit error rate of SITC scheme is too small to obtain accurate
simulation result for most SJR values. We observe that the
SITC scheme indeed further decreases bit error rate, and more-
over, it is the only scheme which yields an acceptably small
bit error rate among the four coding schemes. In contrast,
the BITC scheme which is the parallel concatenation of two
bit-interleaved RSC codes does not improve the performance
of the BICC scheme. This is because the bit error rate of
the BICC scheme is large (≥ 10−2), and the bit error rates
of the component codes in the BITC scheme can only be
larger. Consequently, no improvement is obtained by iterative
turbo decoding. In order to show the relative performances
of these coding schemes under different SNRs and diversity
orders, Figs. 9 and 10 plot the bit error rates of the four
proposed coding schemes under worst-case jamming (which
means that bit error rates are maximized over all jamming
ratios and SJRs) with parameters 𝑟 = 1/3 and 𝑀 = 64 for
diversity orders 𝐿 = 1 and 3, respectively. We observe that
for low SNR or low diversity order 𝐿, the symbol-interleaving
schemes outperform the bit-interleaving schemes. Moreover,
if the system designer’s goal is to maintain bit error rate at
an acceptable level for most situations, the SITC scheme is

the best choice which achieves good-enough performance for
SNR ≥ 6.5 dB. Finally, for comparison, the bit error rates
of the uncoded ML diversity-combining receiver, which can
be viewed as a repetition coding scheme, are also plotted in
Figs. 9 and 10. It can be seen that all four proposed coding
schemes are more effective in jamming suppression than pure
diversity-combining for large diversity order 𝐿. Moreover,
even for low diversity order 𝐿, the SICC and SITC schemes
still outperform the pure diversity-combining scheme.
V. CONCLUSION
We proposed a log-likelihood-combining metric for
FFH/MFSK systems under n=1-band MTJ over Rayleigh
channels. The proposed metric requires only the information
about the average signal energy per hop, the SNR value, the
SJR value, and the jamming ratio for its computation. An
upper bound on the bit error rate of the ML receiver using
the proposed metric is obtained. Simulation results show that
compared with receivers using robust metrics, the proposed
metric not only decreases bit error rate, but also alters the
relationship between bit error rate and SJR. In particular, the

where 𝑅𝐸 = 𝐸ℎ/𝐸𝐽 is the signal-to-jamming energy ratio.
The function that is minimized in (39) is a convex function
in the the range 0 ≤ 𝜆 ≤ 1 and has a minimum point at
𝜆 = 1/2. This reduces 𝐷0 to the Bhattacharyya bound given
in [17], and

It can be easily proved that (𝑅𝐸 +1)(1/𝑅𝐸 +1) is a convex
function of 𝑅𝐸 for 𝑅𝐸 > 0 and has a minimum point at
𝑅𝐸 = 1. Therefore, for any fixed jamming ratio 𝜌, 𝐷0 and thus
the upper bound on 𝑃ML are maximized when the energy ratio
𝑅𝐸 equals 1. The following example with parameters 𝑁0 = 0,
𝐿 = 1, and 𝑀 = 64 illustrates the preceding conclusion. Let
the indices of the desired tone and the jamming tone be 0 and
63 which correspond to bit sequences 𝑏0𝑏1𝑏2𝑏3𝑏4𝑏5 = 000000
and 111111, respectively. It follows that only two envelope
detector outputs 𝑉ℓ0 and 𝑉ℓ63 in the output vector 𝑉 ℓ are
nonzero. Using an argument similar to the one used in deriving
(37), we obtain

In the case of 𝐸𝐽 ≫ 𝐸ℎ, 𝑉ℓ63 > 𝑉ℓ0 and thus 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚 = 0) >
𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚 = 63) occur with high probability. It follows that
the log-likelihood-combining bit metrics satisfy log 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑏𝑖 =
0) > log 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑏𝑖 = 1), and the receiver makes the right
decision most of the time. By a similar argument, we can
show that in the case of 𝐸ℎ ≫ 𝐸𝐽 , the receiver also makes
the right decision most of the time. However, when 𝐸ℎ = 𝐸𝐽 ,
𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚 = 0) = 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚 = 63), and there is a tie between the
bit metrics for 𝑏𝑖 = 0 and 𝑏𝑖 = 1, which increases the bit error
rate.
Let’s now look at the upper bound for the worst-case bit
error rate. Differentiating 𝐷0 with respect to 𝜌 and noting
that the energy ratio 𝑅𝐸 is a linear function of 𝜌 as shown in
(21), we find that 𝐷0 is a strictly increasing function of 𝜌 for
𝜌 ∈ (0, 1]. Therefore, the upper bound on 𝑃ML for 𝜌 = 1 is
an upper bound for the worst-case 𝑃ML. Finally, we observe
that the only inequality in the derivation of the upper bound
appears on (17). Thus the upper bound is tight if and only if
the two likelihood functions 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑏 = 0) and 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑏 = 1) are
equal. By following an argument similar to the one between
(35) and (36) and comparing 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚0) in (37) and 𝑝(𝑽 ∣𝑚1)
in (38), we find that the upper bound is tight if and only if
𝐸ℎ = 𝐸𝐽 .

comparing the two copies of DL_Frame_Prefix. Moreover, the 
DL-MAP contains a CRC-32 which is used to check the 
content of DL-MAP message. Thus, for those SSs which have 
successfully received FCH and DL-MAP, the subcarriers 
carrying the coded bits of FCH and DL-MAP can be used as 
additional pilots for channel estimation of the data subcarriers 
in the following DL bursts. We will present three channel 
estimation methods which make use of these additional pilots. 
Before describing these new channel estimation methods, we 
first describe a popular 2D linear interpolation method which 
uses only the pilot subcarriers defined in the standard for 
channel estimation.  
A. 2D Linear Interpolalation Estimation Method 
This is the most popular estimation method in WiMAX 
systems [2]. The physical subcarriers in WiMAX are divided 
into clusters, each containing 14 adjacent subcarriers. 2 out of 
the 14 subcarriers are designated for pilots in each cluster. Fig. 
2 shows the cluster structure for even and odd OFDMA 
symbols, where the horizontal dimension represents different 
frequency subcarriers, and the vertical dimension represents 
OFDMA symbols. Note that pilot subcarriers are different for 
even and odd symbols, and moreover, the pilot subcarriers are 
not spaced evenly in the spectrum. The receiver uses a two-step 
estimation method to estimate the frequency responses of data 
subcarriers. First, as shown in Fig. 3, the frequency responses 
of data subcarriers in even (and odd) symbols which have the 
same subcarrier indexes as the pilot subcarriers of the two 
adjacent symbols are estimated using linear time-domain 
interpolation between the frequency response estimates of 
these pilot subcarriers. We will refer to these data subcarriers 
as pseudo-pilots. Second, the frequency response estimates of 
the rest data subcarriers are obtained by linear frequency-
domain interpolation between estimates of the nearest pilots or 
pseudo-pilots. This estimation method will be referred to as the 
2D estimation method, and the estimate of physical subcarrier 
k  in OFDMA symbol n  will be denoted as ),(2 nkH D

 in the 
rest of the paper.

               Figure 4.  An example of static weighted-average estimation. 
B. Time-Domain Extrapolation Estimation Method 
In this method, in addition to the pilots defined in the 
standard, the data subcarriers carrying FCH and DL-MAP 
coded data are also used as pilots for the following DL-bursts. 
The frequency response estimates of data subcarriers in 
OFDMA symbols n  and 1n  are obtained by zero-order 
time-domain extrapolation (i.e., the average) of the estimates 
of the same subcarriers in OFDMA symbols 1n  and 2n , if 
these subcarriers in symbols 1n  and 2n  are pilots or carry 
FCH and DL-MAP coded data. Zero-order time-domain 
extrapolation is used instead of first-order extrapolation 
because only two points are included in the extrapolation and 
thus, the effect of AWGN noise may be amplified by first-
order extrapolation. This estimation method will be referred to 
as the time-average estimation method, and the estimate of 
physical subcarrier k  in OFDMA symbol n  will be denoted 
as ),( nkHTA

 in the rest of the paper. 
C. Static Weighted-Average Method  
We consider a mixed channel estimation method in which 
the frequency response estimates are the static weighted-
averages of ),(2 nkH D

 and ),( nkHTA

. From Fig. 3, it is easy to 
see that in 2D estimation, the frequency response estimates of 
subcarriers further away from any pilot or pseudo pilot are less 
meaningful and are subject to greater uncertainty than those of 
the subcarriers near a pilot or a pseudo pilot. Similarly, in time-
average estimation, the estimates of OFDMA symbol 1n , 
based on OFDMA symbols 1n  and 2n , is less reliable than 
those of OFDMA symbol n . This difference in reliability can 
be addressed by giving extra weights to more reliable estimates 
in the weighted averages. Define the frequency distance 
between two physical subcarriers as the number of subcarriers 
in between plus one. For example, the frequency distance 
between two consecutive physical subcarriers is 1. Define the 
symbol distance between different OFDMA symbols as the 
number of OFDMA symbols in between plus one. Let )(ka  be 
the minimum frequency distance between physical subcarrier 
k  and any pilot and pseudo-pilot in the same OFDMA symbol. 
Let )(nb  be the minimum symbol distance between OFDMA 
symbol n  and the last OFDMA symbol included in the zero-
order time-domain extrapolation for the estimations of symbol 
n . The frequency response estimate of physical subcarrier k  in 
OFDMA symbol n  is given by

the simulation, only DL sub-frame of which both FCH and DL-
MAP are successfully decoded are included in the calculation 
of BER, since the SS can only demodulate and decode data 
bursts in these sub-frames. From the figures, we observe that 
the 2D estimation method outperforms the time-average 
estimation method if the channel model is 3GVA (i.e., with 
short delay spread) and vice versa if the channel model is 
3GVB (i.e., with long delay spread). However, the SSs may not 
have information about the channel model to help them choose 
between the two estimation methods. We expect a mixed 
estimation strategy, like the static weighted-average estimation 
method or the adaptive weighted-average estimation method, 
may achieve “good” performance for both channel models. We 
observe that the static weighted-average estimation method 
achieves a BER between those of 2D estimation and time-
average estimation for all channels considered except 3GVB 
with speed 100 km/h. However, its performance is much worse 
than the standard 2D estimation method over 3GVA with speed 
100 km/h. Thus, adaptive weighting is necessary to achieve 
“good” performance for all possible transmission situations. 
The adaptive weighted-average estimation indeed achieves a 
performance approaching the better of the two performances 
attained by 2D estimation and time-average estimation or 
outperforms both of them for all channels considered. We

Figure 9. Decoded BER for 3GVB with speed 100 km/h and 16QAM rate 1/2. 
 
conclude that the adaptive weighted-average estimation method 
is the best estimation method for all channel models considered. 
The 3GVB channel with speed 100 km/h is the toughest 
channel for channel estimation among the four channels 
considered. The BERs of both 2D estimation method and 
time-average estimation method for such channel remain high 
even for high 0/ NEb . Both weighted-average estimation 
methods outperform the 2D estimation and time-average 
estimation. This is because over this channel with long delay 
spread and high speed, mixed estimation strategies (i.e., the 
two weighted-average estimation methods) with more pilot 
subcarriers improve the BER performance. Let’s now consider 
the error probability of an FEC block called block error rate. 
We deduce from Fig. 9 that since the number of data bits in an 
FEC block is 288 bits, the block error rates of the two 
weighted-average methods are almost 1/2 for 20/ 0 NEb dB. 
This block error rate is too high for most applications. One 
way to decrease the block error rate and thus increase the 
throughput is to change the modulation scheme from 16QAM 
to QPSK. Fig. 10 shows the BER performance of the decoded 
data for QPSK with code rate 1/2 (which is the lowest 
transmission rate in the WiMAX) over the same channel

This paper deals with three channel estimation methods for 802.16e downlink. The reviewer judges that 
the proposed “adaptive weighted‐average method”, which combines two channel estimation schemes, 
has sufficient novelty. In addition, this paper clearly shows the detailed explanation and availability of the 
proposed schemes. 
The reviewer’s comments are as follows.   
  ‐ The reviewer can't understand the reason why QPSK modulation result 
      in Fig. 10 is described. He believes that the author should mention 
      the detailed explanation in the case of QPSK modulation. 
  ‐ In Figs. 1 and 2 & 3, the axis dimensions (time and frequency) are 
      seemed to be different. For reader’s easy understanding, the author 
      should modify its inconsistency.
