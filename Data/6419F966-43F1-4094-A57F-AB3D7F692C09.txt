ABSTRACT 
 The endoscopy is a common diagnosis method for the detection of colorectal 
cancer and there are two methods to improve the diagnostic sensitivity. One is 
chromoendoscopy, and the other is magnifying endoscopy. Color contrast dye, such 
as indigo carmine, usually is sprayed on the surface of the intestine and can 
accumulate in the pits and crevices of the mucosa to enhance the identification of the 
lesion. However, this color contrast dye does not have target-specific and 
local-retention properties. For these reason we encapsulated indigo carmine into 
chitosan nanoparticles (CNIC) by the ionic gelation to increase the retention time on 
intestine surface, and conjugated folic acid with chitosan nanoparticles (fCNIC) to 
target specifically to adenomatous polyps. The size and zeta potential of CNIC and 
fCNIC measured by transmission electron microscope and zetasizer were both at the 
range of 120-140 nm and 20 mV, respectively. The loading efficiency of indigo 
carmine in fCNIC was in the range of 60-70% and depended on the concentration of 
acetic acid solution used to dissolve chitosan and folic acid-chitosan conjugates and 
folic acid conjugation percentage. Bioassy results of fCNIC targeting to HT-29 colon 
cancer cells revealed that the prepared particle with high folic acid conjugation had a 
better adhesion effect. 
Moreover, we also report a high-performance nanoparticle for photodynamic 
detection of colorectal neoplasm, where alginate is physically complexed with folic 
acid-modified chitosan to form nanoparticles with improved drug release in the 
cellular lysosome. We found that the incorporated alginate molecules could complex 
stably with chitosan via electrostatic attraction, and the z-average diameter and 
zeta-potential of the prepared nanoparticles (fCAN) was 115 nm and 22 mV, 
respectively, enough to keep the nanoparticles stable in aqueous suspension without 
aggregation. When loaded with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA; 27% loading 
efficiency), the nanoparticles (fCANA) displayed no differences in particle size or 
zeta-potential compared to fCAN. Moreover, the fCANA nanoparticles were readily 
taken up by colorectal cancer cells via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
Subsequently, the loaded 5-ALA was release in the lysosome, and this was promoted 
by the deprotonated alginate to reduce the attraction intensity between chitosan and 
5-ALA, resulting in a higher intracellular PpIX accumulation for the photodynamic 
detection. 
These results implied that fCNIC with high folic acid conjugation could serve as 
an ideal vector for a colon-specific targeting system. And the alginate incorporated 
and folic acid-conjugated chitosan nanoparticles are an ideal vector for 
colorectal-specific delivery of 5-ALA for fluorescent endoscopic detection. 
According to this concept, we designed a novel detection system to enhance the 
accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis for colorectal cancer.

nanoparticle. 
properties, which can prevent it from bacterial uptake in the GI tract [9]. Furthermore, 
chitosan is a linear polyamine containing a number of free amino groups which are 
available for cross-linkages [10]. Chitosan is a suitable material for constructing 
nanoparticles because of its reactive amino groups, which make it more possible to 
chemically modify and conjugate it with various ligands or antibodies. Its cationic 
amino group can form complexes with negatively charged drug/DNA through a 
strong electrostatic interaction [11]. Nanoparticle preparation and encapsulation can 
be manipulated in aqueous solution without involving toxic organic solvents. 
 In order to enhance the targeting ability and uptake of the nanoparticles into 
targeted cells, target-specific ligands, such as folic acid, are used to conjugate to the 
surface of the polymer carrier. Folic acid is a stable, inexpensive, and generally 
poorly immunogenic chemical, and has a high affinity to the folate receptor [12, 13]. 
The folate receptor over-expresses on many human epithelial cancer cell surfaces, 
and the targeting ability of drug/DNA can be performed by producing the delivery 
carrier conjugated with folic acid [14-18]. Folic acid conjugates, which are covalently 
derivative via folate’s γ-carboxyl moiety, can maintain a high affinity to the folate 
receptor, and the mechanism of cellular uptake of folic acid conjugates by folate 
receptors is as well as that of folic acid chemical [19, 20]. They can enter cells by 
folate receptor-mediated endocytosis and move through many organelles by vesicular 
trafficking, which can supplies materials to release into cell cytoplasm. Later, the 
un-ligated folate receptor may recycle to the cell surface to transport more folic acid 
conjugates in the cell cytoplasm [13, 14]. This process has more advantages for the 
efficient intracellular delivery of anticancer agents or macromolecules than the one 
that relies on cell membrane markers. 
Our previous study using folic acid-modified chitosan conjugates as a vehicle for 
5-ALA has shown that the accumulation of PpIX in colorectal cancer cells could be 
enhanced and observed clearly using a spectral confocal and multiphoton system after 
12 hours of incubation [24]. However, the release 5-ALA from the prepared particles 
was lower than that required for fluorescent endoscopic detection. In order to 
improve the release of 5-ALA in the targeted cells, a negatively charged polymer 
might be physically incorporated into the folic acid-modified chitosan nanoparticles 
to compete with 5-ALA for cationic residues of chitosan under conditions 
encountered in the lysosome.  
Alginate, a polyanionic copolymer of 1-4 linked β-D-mannuronic acid and 
α-L-glucuronic acid, can be extracted from brown algae or bacteria [25,26]. It is most 
frequently employed for cell immobilization due to its abundance, superior gelling 
properties, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability [27,28]. At neutral pH, 
carboxyl groups of alginate are deprotonated so that the polymer is highly negatively 
charged. Addition of divalent cations, such as Ca2+, can induce cross-linking of the 
polymer and subsequent gel formation. The advantage of this gelling process is that it 
maintains the biological activity of incorporated molecules in the calcium-crosslinked 
hydrogel or bead under mild aqueous conditions without the need for toxic reagents 
let folic acid conjugate onto chitosan molecules. The solution was dripped with 
diluted NaOH aqueous solution and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm to spin down the folic 
acid-chitosan conjugate. The precipitate was dialyzed first against phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.4) for 3 days and then against water for 4 days. Finally, the folic acid 
conjugated-chitosan was isolated as a sponge form by lyophilization and kept for 
follow-up study. 
 
2.3 Preparation of chitosan nanoparticles 
 The preparation of chitosan nano-particles loaded with indigo carmine was based 
on the ionic gelation interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively 
charged STPP at room temperature [18]. Ionized indigo carmine with negative charge 
also partially contributed to the gelation interactions in this study. The preparation 
process is briefly described as follows: 0.05% chitosan and folic acid-chitosan 
conjugate solution were prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg chitosan powder and 
folic-chitosan conjugate sponge in 1 ml 0.01 M and 0.02 M acetic acid at pH 4.0. 
Indigo carmine powder was dissolved into 0.5 mg/ml STPP solution, where STPP 
were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) beforehand, to the following 
concentrations: 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mg/ml and adjusted the pH value by NaOH to 7.4. 
2 ml of indigo carmine solution were added slowly in 5 ml of chitosan solution or 
folic acid-chitosan conjugate solution by peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min 
to prepare CNIC and fCNIC. Which the folic acid modification tendency in the 
prepared nanoparticles was f06CNIC > f04CNIC > f02CNIC. The prepared CNIC 
and fCNIC nanoparticle suspensions would be directly used in later experiments 
without further treatment. 
The preparation of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with 5-ALA was based on the 
ionic gelation interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively charged 
STPP at room temperature. The negative charge of ionized 5-ALA also partially 
contributed to the gelation interactions in this study. The preparation process is 
briefly described as follows: 0.05% chitosan and folic acid-chitosan conjugate 
solutions were prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg chitosan powder or folic acid-chitosan 
conjugate sponge in 1 ml of 0.01M acetic acid solution at pH 4.0. The 0.15% 5-ALA 
solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5 mg 5-ALA powder in 1 ml of 0.05% STPP 
solution (STPP dissolved in PBS). Either 2 ml of STPP solution or 2 ml of 5-ALA 
solution was added to 5 ml of chitosan or folic acid-chitosan conjugate solution using 
a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min to prepare the CN, CNA, fCN, and 
fCNA nanoparticle suspended solutions. The preparation process of fCAN and 
fCANA was similar to that of fCN and fCNA, but the STPP and 5-ALA solutions 
were exchanged with 0.01% alginate solution and 5-ALA/alginate (15/1 w/w) 
solutions. The prepared nanoparticle suspended solutions were later used directly 
without further treatment. 
 
2.4 Average particle size and zeta potential 
 Carbon coated 200 mesh copper grids were immersed in CNIC, fCNIC, CNA, 
fCNA, or fCANA solutions. The grids were placed on delicate-task-wipers to absorb 
excess liquid and were dried in a desiccator overnight. The dried copper grids with 
CNIC, fCNIC, CNA, fCNA, or fCANA were examined under the JOEL JEM-1230 
Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL Co. Ltd., JAPAN). 
 
2.7 Determination of targeting efficiency on HT-29 cells 
HT-29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) 
supplement with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 10mM 
non-essential amino acids, 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 Ag/ml streptomycin, at 37°C 
and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cultured medium was changed on alternate 
days until confluent. HT-29 cells were seeded on 6-well culture plates at a cell 
density of 1.8×106/well. After HT-29 cells were cultured for 3 days to confluence, the 
medium was replaced by a fresh medium with pure drug of indigo carmine, CNIC or 
fCNIC added, in which the concentration of indigo carmine was maintained at 0.5 
mg/ml. CNIC or fCNIC solutions was concentrated to 20 times by Amicon Ultra 
(Centrifugal Filter Devices, MILLIPORE) to remove the unloaded indigo carmine 
beforehand. HT-29 cells were further cultured for 1 and 3 hours to allow 
nanoparticles target to cells surface. Then the cells were rinsed with PBS for 3 times 
and added 250 μl DMSO to dissolve. The OD value of the mixture was read at 618 
nm by ELISA reader (Sunrise-Basic Tecan, Switzerland). The OD618 value of indigo 
carmine-treated cells was arbitrarily defined as 100% 
 
2.8 Measurement of accumulated PpIX 
A total of 1.2×105 HT29 cells/well were seeded onto 24-well culture plates and 
grown for 24 hours. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing CNA, 
fCNA, or fCANA. The particle solutions were concentrated beforehand using 
Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove 
the unloaded 5-ALA. Moreover, because of no blood supplement in the 
gastrointestinal tract, fresh medium without serum supplement was used. Cells were 
further cultured for 12 hours to allow uptake of the nanoparticles and to convert 
5-ALA to PpIX. In order to determine the effect of folic acid/folate receptor mediated 
endocytosis on the endogenously synthesized PpIX, fresh culture media (both with 
and without free folic acid) was tested at the same time. The concentration of free 
folic acid (5 mM) used was expected to result in complete saturation of the folate 
receptors.19 After removal of the cultured medium, plates were washed three times 
with PBS. The PpIX was extracted with DMSO and the fluorescent intensity of PpIX 
was determined using a spectrofluorometer (SpectraMax Gemine XS; Molecular 
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an 
emission wavelength of 635 nm. The fluorescent intensity was expressed as the 
accumulative percentage. 
In order to evaluate the feasibility of using the prepared fCNA for detection of 
Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA) and then 
snap-frozen on dry ice. Cryosections of 5� m thickness were fixed with acetone at 
4oC for 5 min and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or examined 
directly using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, 
Göttingen, Germany). 
 
2.11 Statistical Analysis 
All experiments were repeated and measured in triplicate, and mean, standard 
deviation, and graphs were used to describe the data. One-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was made to assess the differences in the OD618 of indigo carmine while 
HT-29 cells fed with indigo carmine, CNIC and fCNIC for 1 and 3 hours. All p values 
were two-sided and their significant level was 0.05. SPSS 11.0 was used to conduct 
all statistical analysis. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles 
 The characteristic of the folic acid-chitosan conjugates has been determined with 
the ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and shows that folic acid can be conjugated 
onto chitosan molecules by the conjugation of its γ-carboxyl moiety to amino group 
of chitosan, and the different content of conjugated folic acid can be fabricated by 
manipulating the amino groups to folic acid molar ratio in the production process [17, 
21]. 
Figure 1A shows the average particle size of CNIC and fCNIC those were 
prepared by adding different concentrations of indigo carmine into chitosan and folic 
acid-chitosan conjugate solutions, where chitosan and folic acid-conjugates were 
dissolved in 0.01 M acetic acid solution beforehand. The average particle size of the 
prepared nanoparticles showed a slight increase with raising the conjugated folic acid 
content and was in the range of 100-200 nm when the concentration of indigo 
carmine solution was 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml. However, if the indigo carmine 
concentration in the solution was 0.75 mg/ml, the particle size of CNIC was 200 nm 
and sharply increased when the CNIC was modified with folic acid, as was so-called 
fCNIC. Furthermore, when adding 0.75 mg/ml indigo carmine into chitosan or folic 
acid-chitosan solutions, the particle size was unstable and got a large standard 
vibration depending on the content of folic acid conjugation. When chitosan or folic 
acid-chitosan conjugates are dissolved in 0.02 M acetic acid solution and then added 
with different concentrations of indigo carmine solution to prepare nanoparticles, the 
results of average particle size are shown in Figure 1B. The particle size was in the 
range of 100-150 nm and independent on the folic acid conjugation while the 
nanoparticles were prepared at the indigo carmine concentration of either 0.25 mg/ml 
or 0.5 mg/ml. When adding 0.75 mg/ml indigo carmine solution into chitosan and 
folic acid-chitosan conjugate solutions, the particle size of CNIC and fCNIC were 
hindrance of folate derivatives on the chitosan backbone might inhibit the interaction 
between chitosan and 5-ALA. When alginate was incorporated into the fCNA 
particles, the loading efficiency of 5-ALA decreased to 27%, suggesting that alginate 
bound with the cationic residues of chitosan and reduced the available cationic 
residues able to bind with 5-ALA. As such, the loading efficiency of the particles 
appeared strongly dependent on folic acid conjugation and alginate incorporation. 
 Figure 4 shows the particle size of CNIC, fCNIC, CNA, fCNA, and fCANA as 
determined by transmission electron microscopic examination. When the particles 
were prepared at 0.5 mg/ml indigo carmine and used 0.02 M acetic acid solution to 
dissolve chitosan and folic acid-chitosan conjugates, the particle size was all in the 
range of 20-100 nm and independent from the conjugated folic acid content. The 
particle size distribution of CNA was primarily in the range of 60–150 nm, but this 
fell into the range of 100–400 nm for fCNA. If alginate was complexed with the folic 
acid-modified chitosan to form fCANA, the distribution of particle size was in the 
range of 120–500 nm. Therefore, the particle size distribution strongly depended on 
and increased with folic acid conjugation and alginate incorporation. The results are 
smaller than that measured by dynamic light scattering measurements using the 
Zetasizer-3000 (this data is not shown).  
 
3.2 Determination of targeting efficiency on HT-29 cells 
 Figure 5 shows the OD618 value of indigo carmine targeting to the HT-29 cell 
post-fed with pure indigo carmine, CNIC and fCNIC for 1 and 3 hours. In which the 
bright intensity of pure indigo carmine group was designated as 100%. When fCNIC 
with the highest folic acid modification, f06CNIC, was fed to HT-29 cells for 1 hour, 
the increase in intensity of brightness was 73% compared to the pure indigo carmine 
group (Figure 5A). However, there was not a significant difference between pure 
indigo carmine and CNIC or fCNIC with low folic acid conjugation, such as 
f02CNIC and f04CNIC. If incubating f06CNIC with HT-29 cells for 3 hours, the 
OD618 of indigo carmine targeting to the HT-29 cell was up-to 325% in comparison 
with the pure indigo carmine (Figure 5B). In addition, when the folic acid 
conjugation percentage in the prepared fCNIC decreased, the relative targeting 
efficiency of indigo carmine to HT-29 cells decreased. 
 
3.3 Measurement of accumulated PpIX 
Figure 6A shows the relative fluorescent intensity of PpIX in the HT29 cells 
cultured in a medium with or without addition of free folic acid. The emission value 
of the CNA group was designated as 100%. Figure 6A shows that the increase of 
PpIX emission in HT29 cells was only 46% when the cells were cultured with fCNA 
for 12 hours. However, when HT29 cells were cultured with fCANA, the increase in 
emission intensity significantly was up to 129%, suggesting that folic acid 
conjugation resulted in a stronger affinity of the prepared particles to the folate 
receptor at the HT29 cell membrane and a higher efficacy of internalization, and the 
calcein at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0 in the presence or absence of alginate. As shown in 
Figure 8, there was no significant difference between the calcein release profiles of 
CN and fCN at pH 7.4 in the presence of alginate, suggesting that the electrostatic 
interaction between chitosan and calcein or alginate was weak due to the 
deprotonation of amino groups on chitosan and that the calcein release from the 
particles was mainly governed by diffusion. However, at pH 5.0, which mimicked the 
lysosomal environment, the release rate of calcein in the presence of alginate was 
higher than that in the absence of alginate for both the CN and fCN groups. A 
comparison was made of the absolute values of the slopes of the curves generated 
over the first three hours of the experiment. When alginate was added into the CN 
solution, the increase in the slope of the calcein release curve was 21%, and this was 
significantly increased to 104% after addition of alginate to the fCN solution. This 
suggested that alginate could reduce the intensity of the interaction between chitosan 
and calcein by competing for cationic residues, thereby allowing release of calcein 
under these conditions. Therefore, these results revealed that the release of 5-ALA in 
the lysosome could be improved by the incorporation of alginate, and subsequent 
accumulation of PpIX might be sufficiently enhanced for fluorescent endoscopic 
detection. 
 
3.5 Photodynamic detection of intestinal neoplasm 
 To obtain direct photodynamic detection of intestinal neoplasm, 
C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J strain mice with highly susceptible to spontaneous intestinal 
neoplasm formation are appropriate as an animal model for this study. Three- to 
four-month-old C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J male mice were pre-fed with 5% glucose solution, 
5-ALA, or the prepared fCANA nanoparticle solutions. After 18 hours, all mice were 
sacrificed; the small bowels and colons were opened longitudinally, rinsed with 
ice-cold PBS, and examined under a fluorescence stereomicroscope to identify the 
tumors. As shown in Figure 9B, no red fluorescence in intestinal tumors could be 
observed under a fluorescent stereomicroscope when mice were fed only with a 5% 
glucose solution. However, when mice were fed with pure 5-ALA or the prepared 
fCANA solutions, the engulfment of pure 5-ALA or 5-ALA in the prepared 
nanoparticles in tumor tissues was released in the lysosomes and converted into PpIX 
and observed as red fluorescence (Figure 9D and F). In addition, the fCANA group 
exhibited a stronger red fluorescence than the 5-ALA group, suggesting that fCANA 
could be substantially internalized into neoplastic tissues via folate receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. In contrast, when the C57BL/6J strain mice, which do not demonstrate 
spontaneous intestinal neoplasm formation, were fed a 5% glucose solution, 5-ALA, 
or fCANA for 18 h, no red fluorescence was observed in the intestinal tissues (Figure 
9H, J, and L). 
 The histology of the intestine from C57BL/6J-ApcMin/J strain mice fed with 5% 
glucose, 5-ALA, or fCANA was evaluated by H&E staining and observed under an 
inverted fluorescence microscope. There was no visible red fluorescence in the
