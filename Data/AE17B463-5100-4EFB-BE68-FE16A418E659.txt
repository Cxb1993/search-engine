1. Introduction 
To precisely allocate the unique peptide motifs from an enzyme family employing current 
biological tools, it is necessary to prepare a large number of well-defined chemical derivatives 
and partial segments from the protein sequences for enzymatic activity tests.  The complete 
experiments and pathway from protein sequence to monoclonal antibody and vaccine 
development are ever so much cost- intensive and lengthy. Therefore, it is important and incentive 
to predict candidate peptides computationally prior to development of hands on experiments. 
Previous methods for epitope prediction focused on distinguishing possible candidates by 
examining the presence of the appropriate primary/secondary anchor residues (1) (2). These 
prediction methods are based on the identified and published motifs for anchor identification. 
Lately, the prediction strategies give emphasis on pattern matching technologies including 
statistical, machine learning methodologies and structural information (3)(4)(5)(6).  However, 
pure sequence based methods have inherent statistical limits, and the use of structural information 
have been shown to increase both the sensitivity in detection and accuracy in alignment. The 
Protein Data Bank (PDB) currently holds more than 31,700 structures and many more protein 
structures being experimentally determined in structural genomic initiatives. Since the ultimate 
goal is to unveil the function of all proteins, it is obvious that 3D structure comparison becomes a 
significant task and it may reveal biologically interesting similarities which are not detectable by 
direct sequence alignment. Several protein structure comparison tools, and many of the 
methodologies focus on the superposition of protein structures to obtain the results of sequence 
alignment based on their structural information. Structural comparison results lead to 
understanding of the evolutionary relationships and physico-chemical interactions among protein 
sequences. At this moment, only a few public web services are available to perform multiple 
protein structure alignment, such as MultiProt(7)  (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/ MultiProt/) 
which finds the common geometrical cores between the input molecules and detects high scoring 
partial multiple alignments for all possible number of molecules from the input ; CE (8) 
(http://cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html) which employs the combinatorial method on aligned fragment pairs of 
a given length; JOY(9) (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/joy/ ) which is developed to display 3D 
structural information in a sequence alignment and to help understand the conservation of amino 
acids in their specific local environments; COMPARER(10) 
(http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/COMPARER/) which utilizes the DiCE structural alignment 
program to superimpose selected structures and provide output file in the JOY format. 
After multiple structures have been superimposed by three-dimensional rigid body rotation, a 
common measurement of structural similarity is evaluated by the RMSD between the positions of 
the corresponding amino acid pairs on these aligned protein structures. However, it has been 
argued that the RMSD measurements are ambiguous with respect to distantly related proteins 
(11). One of the reasons is that portions of mismatched substructure tend to dominate the RMSD 
values for remotely related sequences. To avoid such a dilemma, the RMSD was selected as a 
measuring parameter of the proposed system, and at least 30% sequence identity among protein 
sequences was set as the basic requirement prior to our CMSFA. This assumption is reasonable 
when our main goals are to search the unique peptide motifs from a family protein sequences 
based on their tertiary structure information. 
 Here we present a new method that combines multiple combinatorial features and multiple 
structure alignments for identification of unique peptide motifs. This combination enhances both 
sensitivity of sequence search and quality of structural alignment. In our approach, combinatorial 
features of related family sequences are aligned by applying dynamic programming on labeled 
local consensus motifs which are searched by interval jumping approximate searching 
algorithms(LIJSA) (12). These combinatorial subsegments represent common characteristics of a 
protein family and positions of the corresponding key amino acids were selected for efficient  and 
effective three-dimensional multiple structure alignment processes. The aligned structures were 
then compared and measured for identification of residues comprising substructures or surface 
regions that were conserved with respect to the target protein, yet unique with respect to other 
proteins in the family.  In this paper, the methodology was applied to identify unique structural 
features in RNase A superfamily and ricin A related sequences that could be targeted for 
developing reagents for antibody binding assays.  More details of the proposed algorithms are 
introduced in the following sections.   
suggested to execute the clustering operations prior to combinatorial feature extraction 
procedures.  The clustering algorithms utilize the searched consensus segments from the 
previous module and their respective clustering scoring matrices are calculated for grouping 
procedures. The agglomerative clustering algorithms are employed to cluster sequences into 
several subgroups, and our system takes the simple linkage, a kind of hierarchical measurement 
to determine which sequences should be grouped together.  After the clustering for all imported 
protein sequences, each clustered subgroup family is then individually performing consensus 
motif searching operations with target protein sequence followed by the combinatorial feature 
analysis. The combinatorial feature analysis module performs indexed multiple sequence 
alignment based on Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms. The fundamental elements in DP 
algorithms are labeled consensus motifs instead of individual residues. Details of the algorithms 
will be introduced in the other submitted paper entitled as “Group Feature Extraction from 
Multiple Indexing Sequence Alignment Based on Indexing Consensus Motifs.”  The output 
results from this module provide combinatorial features sequentially for each subgroup family, 
and those features are composed of merged local consensus motifs and will enhance the 
important characteristics of each subgroup.  One of the output examples of RNase A superfamily 
is shown in Figure 1, and the combinatorial features are represented in large and uppercase amino 
acids. 
2.4  Alignment and Unique Pattern Searching  
The modules in second phase include key residues analysis, constrained 3D feature 
alignment, and unique peptide identification.  According to the combinatorial features, the 
module of key residue analysis evaluates priority score, )( jc p , of each residue for further 
identification.  The priority score is determined by protein interaction properties including 
homology ( ][×HO ), charge ( ][×CH ) and hydrophilicity ( ][×HY ).  In this procedure, identical amino 
acids from aligned segments are referred as candidates of key amino acids and assigned into the 
homologous set ][×HO .  If an amino acid in ][×HO  is charged and possesses hydrophilicity, it is 
assigned with the highest score of 3.  Assume the amino acid possessing charged feature only, it 
obtains a score of 2.  The amino acid will be assigned a score of 1 when it holds hydrophilic 
feature only.  All other amino acids without charged and hydrophilic features will not be 
assigned with any score by the system.  Consequently, if )( jWi  belongs to one consensus 
segment, the priority score represents its degree of chemical properties of the protein, and is 
formulated as )]([)]([)]([)( jWHYjWCHjWHOjC iiip ++= .  For proteins possessing enzyme activities, 
the system will regard the set of residues, }{×KR  possessing the highest scores in each 
combinatorial feature segment, as the potential key residues for further constrained multiple 
structure feature alignment. 
Afterwards, the geometric centers of the selected key sites in each aligned consensus motif 
are calculated as )

are utilized to perform constrained multiple structure feature alignment.  With these centers, the 
module will randomly choose three candidates for multiple alignments, since three spatial 
positions can determine a surface plane and then confirm the orientation of each structure. Based 
on the target protein fo r the unique peptide identification, all other proteins in each subgroup 
family will be aligned rapidly with their fixed plane in 3D space constructed from the selected 
points.  The pseudo-codes of the three-point alignment are described in the followings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The unique peptide identification module calculates RMSD values between target protein and 
others in each subgroup family.  The module will allow users to input two parameters for 
searching unique segments.  The first parameter, rmsdT , is the RMSD threshold which provides 
the evaluation of distant deviation.  The module will pick the residue that )( jRk  is greater or 
equal than rmsdT .  Then, the uniqueness of each residue of tW  are computed by the following 
formula, å

Assume the selected three points of the target protein (no change) are 
C0, C1, C2 in sequential order and C0’, C1’, C2’  for the aligned 
protein (to rotate and translate), the steps of the alignment: 
Step1: translate C0’ to C0. 
Step2: fixe C0’(C0), rotate '1'0 CC  to 10CC  according to the C0C1’C1 
plane. 
combinatorial features hold tolerant characteristics in our system which guarantees the realization 
of combinatorial feature extraction if basic requirements of more than 30% identity are satisfied. 
However, if the importing sequences indeed possess diversely distributed residues, the 
combinatorial features may not exist and therefore CMSFA can not provide appropriate solutions. 
So far, under wide range of testing cases, our proposed algorithms provide superior performance 
in terms of accuracy and efficiency.  Here, we compare the performance of CMSFA with that of 
well-known structural alignment systems such as DALI (14), CE (8), LGA (15), and FAST (16).  
The test cases were performed on the following pairs of known protein structures (15)(16): 
(1df4:A, 1qce:A), (1hx8:A, 1hg5:A), (1oyc:_, 2tmd:A), (1af6:A, 1a0t:_), and (2sim:_, 1nsb:A).  
[Four character PDB codes followed by a colon and the chain identifier identify the protein 
polypeptide chains whereas proteins with unassigned polypeptide chains are symbolized by an 
underscore (_).]  The comparison results are showed in Table 2.  All the RMSD values for our 
CMSFA are less than or equal to those of the existing programs and the number of matched 
residues successfully identified are greater than or equal to those of the best conditions of other 
algorithms.

In this study, we have implemented a novel algorithm for multiple  protein structura l alignment and 
provided the pre-aligned results called Protein Hierarchical Selection (PHS) for various protein families.  
The proposed algorithm is developed based on the combination of sequence features, secondary structure 
information, and molecular surface distribution, which provides outstanding performance in terms of 
speed and accuracy comparing with other multiple structural alignment algorithms.  To evaluate the 
proposed algorithm, the SCOP, a database of structural classification of protein families, is incorporated 
and analyzed.  The SCOP provides manually delineated protein domain definitions and contributes a 
completely curated manual classification revealing different levels of relationship.  We have designed an 
interactive tree-structure interface for efficiently browsing and retrieving the aligned PDB files from the 
SCOP hierarchy structures.  In addition to the visualization of a tree structure, the keyword searching and 
sequence identity filter functions on superfamily, family, and protein levels are also provided in our 
developed system.  The well known problems of protein structures include that the majority of domain 
sequences in the PDBs are highly homologous to each other, or a protein structure may contain various 
IDs from different research laborator ies.  Such redundancy or duplicated data might affect further 
analysis on distinctive or conserved feature patterns.  Therefore, we include the information from 
ASTRAL database to reduce the redundancy by selecting high quality representatives based on the 
considerations of the resolution of PDB files, chemical structure, and the background structure database.  
In this report, we focus our experiments on the family and protein levels of the SCOP database.  The 
constrained multiple structure feature alignment is performed on each defined family and the results are 
recorded for further advanced researches such as key active site recognition, protein interaction, and linear 
and conformational epitope prediction.  To construct the PHS database, one representative structure is 
selected from different species for the protein level alignment and one from each protein levels for the 
alignment of family sets.  All the key structures are chosen according to ASTRAL’s definitions, and a 
total of 1512 sets in protein level and 1035 sets in family level are employed for evaluation.  The results 
show that 96% of protein level and 81% of family level sets are aligned properly from the proposed
