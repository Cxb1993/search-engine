  
from 56℃ to under 21℃ similar to the behavior reported 
for SmC* phase [4]. The strength of these current peaks 
increase slightly with decreasing temperature, but the 
relative position of these peaks is almost unchanged. 
Figure 3 shows that the tilt angles increase as the 
temperature decreasing. The maximum apparent apparent 
tilt angle is about 32 degree. 
    Figure 4 shows some representative results of 
spontaneous polarization Ps as a function of temperature 
measured for the series Ⅲ(m=8-10). The maximum Ps 
values are in the range 40~91 nC/cm2. The temperature 
dependence of the dielectric constants ε′ measured at 
100Hz in 25µm homogeneously cells was investigated. The 
dielectric measurement were employed using an HP4282A 
precision LCR mater, and data were analyzed with a 
resistor-capacitor parallel circuit model. The result of the 
dielectric constants ε′ as a function of temperature 
measured for this series is shown in Figure 5. During 
cooling, the ε′ in the SmA* phase is small and increases at 
the SmA* to SmC* transition. The great enhancement of 
dielectric constant SmC* phase is due to the contribution of 
the Goldstone mode [5]. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Chiral materials derived from 
(S)-1-(2,2,3,3-trifluorobutoxy)-2-propanol have been 
demonstrated to possess a ferroelectric SmC* phase. The 
relationship between molecular structure and physical 
properties in the SmC* phase has been primarily 
established. The temperature range of the SmC* phase 
increased with the chain length of terminal achiral chains 
increased. The maximum magnitude of spontaneous 
polarization (Ps) is about 91 nC/cm2.

PART 2: TGBA* phase in diftuoro-Substituted chinal liquid crystal materials 
 
ABSTRACT 
A novel series of diftuoro-substituted chiral liquid crystals 
derived from (S)-2-alkoxypropanoic acid chiral tail was prepared 
and the mesomorphic phases investigated. It was found that 
materials with shorter chiral chain length (n = 2 to 3) favor the 
formation of Twist Grain Boundary Phase. An increase of 
non-chiral carbon chain length results in disappearance of 
TGBA* Phase. In this series, all of the materials exhibited N* 、
SmA* and SmC*. The switching current, spontaneous 
polarization, tilt angle, dielectric constant and electro-optical 
response for the materials in SmC* phase were investigated. The 
maximum magnitude of spontaneous polarization (PS) is about 
100 nC/cm2. The maximum tilt angle is about 26°. The 
electro-optic responses measurement showed a single hysteresis 
loop properties in ferroelectric phase.     
Keywords: twist grain boundary phase, ferroelectric property, 
single hysteresis loop.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Twist grain boundary (TGB) phases in liquid crystals is one of 
nature’s most remarkable phases. TGB are known to occur at the 
transition from smectic A (SmA) or chiral smectic C* (SmC*) to 
chiral nematic (N*) or isotropic (Iso.) phases. The TGB phase 
consists of blocks of semectic layers, the successive blocks being 
rotated by a constant angle to give a helical structure [1]. 
In 1972 de Gennes [2] put forward the idea that smectics 
composed of chiral molecules can twist by developing screw 
dislocation (in analogy to type II of superconductors). In 1976 
existence of ferroelectricity experimentally proved, 
ferroelectricity-smectic phases with chiral molecules tilted from 
the layer normal (SmC* phase). In 1988 Renn and Lubensky[3,4] 
theoretically described new phase consisting of defects TGB, 
highly defected phase, generally frustrated. In 1989 Goodby and 
coworkers [5,6] reported first experimental observation of 
TGBA* phase. 
     In this series, we investigate the effect of lengthening the  
non-chiral carbon chain length (m = 8-9) and chiral chain length 
(n = 2-5) on the formation of TGBA* phase. 
 
 
 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
The chemical structures for intermediates and target materials 
were analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using 
a Jeol EX-500 FT NMR spectrometer. Infrared spectra were 
recorded on a Horiba FT-720 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) 
spectrometer. The Purity was checked by thin layer 
chromatography TLC and further confirmed by elemental 
analysis using a Perkin-Elmer 2400 spectrometer. Transition 
temperatures and phase transition enthalpies of compounds were 
determined by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) using a 
Perkin-Elmer DSC7 calorimeter at running rates of 5 ℃ 
min-1.Mesophases were principally identified by microscopic 
texture of the materials sandwiched between two glass plates 
under crossed polarizing microscope using a Nikon 
MICROPHOT-FXA with an Mettler FP82 hot stage. 
     The physical properties of the ferroelectric phase for the 
materials were measured in 5µm homogeneously aligned cells, 
which were purchased from E.H.C.Co.Japan. The magnitude of 
spontaneous polarization (PS) was measured by a triangular wave 
method [7]. 
     A triangular wave was applied to the sample from a Yogaw 
AG1200 arbitrary waveform generator. The induced current was 
displayed by measuring the voltage across a wire-wound resistor 
using a Hewlet-Packard HP54502A digital storage oscilloscope. 
    The measurement of optical transmittance versus applied 
electric field was conducted by using a He-Ne laser (5mW, 632.8 
nm) as a probe beam [8,9].  
     The optical transmittance of the probe beam passing 
though the cell between crossed polarizers, whose axes were 
parallel and perpendicular to the smectic layer normal, was 
detected by a photodiode. The signals were monitored by the 
digital oscilloscope (HP54502A). The voltage applied to the cell 
was produced by the arbitrary wave form generator (AG1200) 
and amplified by a homemade power preamplifier.  
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Phase Sequences and Transition Temperatures 
The mesophases, transition temperature, and enthalpies of 
the transitions for the materials are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 
shows:(a) The oily streaks texture of N* phase，(b) The grandjean 
texture of TGBA* phase，(c) The focal-conic texture of SmA* 
phase and (d) The striated focal-conic texture of SmC* phase.  
3.2 Switching Current Behavior 
Figure 2 shows the electrical response to the switching of 
series I (m，n = 8，2) in a 5µm thick cell under a triangular wave 
voltage with the field frequency of 20 Hz and the amplitude of 5 
V. The switching currents display one current peak from 110  to ℃
under 60  similar to the behavior reported for SmC℃ * phase [10]. 
The strength of these current peaks increase slightly with 
decreasing temperature, but the relative position of these peaks is 
almost unchanged. 
3.3 Spontaneous Polarization and Optical Tilt Angle 
Figure 3 shows some representative results of spontaneous 
polarization PS as a function of temperature measured for the 
series Ι (m = 8-9，n = 2-5). The maximum magnitude of 
spontaneous polarization (PS) is about 100 nC/cm2.  
Figure 4 shows that the tilt angles increase as the Series I (m,n)
