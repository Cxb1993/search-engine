在導電薄膜的應用方面，近年有許多利用
旋轉塗佈、真空過濾、印刷、以及觸媒成長等

三、研究方法 
A. 滲濾模型 
我們採用蒙地卡羅法來建立滲濾模型。碳管
長度固定為 1 m，每根碳管的位置和方向，由
三個均勻分佈的隨機數決定，分別是 x:水平座
標，y:垂直座標，:角度，亦即碳管的起點座
標為(x, y)，旋轉角度為，長度為 1 m。重複
N次，即可建立 N根碳管的網絡。在此模型中，
我們只考慮碳管網絡能否連結源極和汲極電
極，暫不考慮碳管是半導體或是金屬性質。只
要有一個連結路徑，就稱為導通，反之則為不
導通。 
碳管密度 D 定義為碳管數量除以通道面
積，亦即 D=N/(LxW)，其中 L和 W分別為通
道長度和寬度。對每一個 N, L, W的組合，產
生 m個碳管網絡，其中使 99%的網絡導通的 D
定義為臨界密度。 
 
B. CNT NWTFT製作 
本研究製作複晶矽背閘極元件結構，剖面及
平面示意圖如圖 1，此元件具有複晶矽背閘
極、Al2O3閘極介電層、Pd源極/汲極接觸金屬。 
製作流程如圖 2 所示。以六吋 p-type 矽晶
圓為基板，高溫氧化成長 150 nm 的氧化層，
以隔離元件和基板。接著沈積 50 nm的同步摻
雜複晶矽，併在 900 C退火使載子活化並穩定
結晶。經第一次微影蝕刻製程，定義出背閘極
區域，如圖 2(a)所示。接著以原子層沈積(ALD)
系統沈積 10nm的 Al2O3，再施以 700C氮氣退
火 30分鐘，完成閘極介電層，如圖 2(b)所示。
以第二次微影蝕刻製程，將背閘極接觸窗處的
Al2O3 去除，接著以旋轉塗佈方式形成 CNT 
NW，如圖 2(c)所示。旋塗條件如下：以 1 mg
平均長度 1.4 m 的 CNT 粉末溶於 40 ml 的
DMF溶液，經 24小時超音波震盪使 CNT均勻
懸浮於其中。將約 0.1ml 的溶液滴於試片表
面，以 500 rpm/10 sec以及 2500 rpm/20 sec的
兩階段旋轉，使 CNT均勻分佈在試片表面。為
了提高 CNT密度，可以重複此旋轉塗佈製程，
本研究採用 20, 30, 40 , 60次塗佈。 
接著以第三次微影製程，加上氧氣電漿蝕
刻，將元件區域外的 CNT NW去除。再以第四
次微影製程定義源極/汲極電極圖案，以濺鍍系
統沈積 60 nm的 Pd，再以掀離法去除光阻區的
金屬，及完成元件製作，如圖 2(d)所示。 
 
C. CNT NWCF製作 
本研究亦採用旋轉塗佈技術，製作高密度的
碳管網絡，以期得到高導電係數的薄膜。測試
結構是如圖 3所示的四端點橋式電阻，碳管網
絡分為固定長度以及固定寬度兩群組，固定長
度的群組，長度為 100 m，寬度 5 m到 500 
m，相當於長寬比是 0.2到 20。固定寬度的群
組，寬度為 5 m，長度從 5 m到 1000 m，
長寬比是 1到 200。金屬連線是厚度比例 9:1，
總厚度 60 nm的 Pd/Ti。使用的碳管是 Carbolex
公司以 arc 放電方式生產的奈米碳管粉末，直
徑約 1.4 nm，平均長度是 3.5 m，半導體性和
金屬性碳管的比例約 2:1。碳管粉末中，含有
50%~70%的 Y, Ni等觸媒殘留。碳管溶液的配
製是將 2 mg的碳管粉末置入 40 ml的 DMF溶
液，經 24小時超音波震盪使 CNT均勻懸浮於
其中。為了提高碳管密度，並避免碳管糾結，
每次塗佈是滴吸取 0.5 ml溶液，旋轉塗佈後，
以 120 C烘烤。塗佈次數包括 20, 40 , 160次，
使用溶液量分別是 10, 20 , 40 ml。經過多次塗
佈，即形成單層(SL)碳管網絡。碳管網絡圖案
是以氧氣電漿蝕刻定義。製作流程如圖 4 所
示。為了提高導通量率，我們也嘗試多層薄膜
結構，在第一層碳管薄膜形成之後，以 ALD
沈積一層 Al2O3，在進行第二次旋轉塗佈，形
成雙層結構(DL)。其餘製程條件均與單層結構
相同。

較高的導電率以及導通良率，即使長寬比達到

通良率。圖 32解釋導通良率改善的機制，如果
只有一層碳管網絡，任何一個地方沒有形成導
通路徑，薄膜就成為斷路，對於雙層結構，某
一層斷路的位置，其上方或是下方的網絡如果
是通路，電流可以穿隧到另一層傳導，如果上
下層都是通路，則有並連的作用，因此導電率
較高且導通良率大幅提升。 
圖 33 是以滲濾理論分析導通方式的結
果，單層結構在很低的長寬比就進入
percolation region，雙層結構則比較晚進入
percolation region，但是因為較高轉速的碳管密
度較低，即使是雙層結構，也沒有觀察到 linear 
region。 
圖 34顯示降低旋轉塗佈速率為 100 rpm後
的導電率和長寬比的關係。因為單層的碳管密
度增加，所以單層結構的導通良率也獲得改
善，但是當長寬比超過 100時，單層結構的導
通良率幾乎是零，而雙層結構還是有較高的導
通良率。以 20 ml溶液量，雙層結構在長寬比
為 1的情況下，最高導電率可以達到 1x10-5 S，
雖然仍低於銅導線的理想值，我們相信如果採
用多層結構，減少半導體性碳管比例，可以更
進一步提高導電率、減小變異；提高導通良率。

developed an effective method to enhance the conductivity of
spin-coated CNT networks by depositing CNT on three types of
substrates (silicon, glass, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET))
that were treated with amine-rich poly-L-lysine (PLL). The results
show that they have improved the sheet conductance of spin-
coated CNT networks to about 7  105 S [26]. This work attempts
to address a simple and low temperature fabrication process, slow
spin rate coating and dry etching, to construct various sizes of CNT-
interconnects and demonstrate the size associated characteristics
of the conductance, variations, and conductive probability of the
CNT-interconnects. In addition, the transition of CNT-interconnect
electrical properties resulting from different times of coating cycles
and the area of CNT-interconnect regime will be shown and inter-
preted by percolation theory as well.
2. Experiments
Two sets of CNT-interconnects were designed for the size
dependent conductivity investigation as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The
CNT-interconnects in the ﬁrst set have ﬁxed length at 100 lmwith
width varying from 5 lm to 500 lm, while the other set has ﬁxed
width at 5 lmwith length varying from 5 lm to 1000 lm. The for-
mer set is named width varying CNT-interconnects and the num-
ber of squares is in the range of 0.2–20. The latter is named
length varying CNT-interconnects and the number of squares is
in the range of 1–200. The square number, the length of intercon-
nect (L) divided by the width of interconnect (W), is a common fac-
tor for designing interconnects in the VLSI technology. The
conductance of each CNT-interconnect was measured by a four-
terminal bridge resistor as depicted in Fig. 1b. The starting mate-
rial, boron-doped (100)-oriented 4-inch-diameter silicon wafer,
was ﬁrst capped by a 200-nm-thick thermal oxide and followed
by a 1-nm-thick layer of Al2O3 deposited by an atomic-layer depo-
sition (ALD) system in order to improve the uniformity of CNT dis-
tribution [27,28]. In this experiment, we adopted AP-grade CNT
powder commercially available from Carbolex which contains the
CNTs with an average diameter of 1.4 nm and an average length
of 3.5 lm. The distribution of the semiconducting and metallic
CNT in the powder is about 2:1 as determined by Raman spectros-
copy [29]. In addition, the purity of CNT powder is 50–70% with
residue catalyst Yttrium (Y) and Nickel (Ni). The CNT solution for
the experiment was prepared by dissolving 2 mg arc discharge
grown CNTs in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent and then was
uniformly dispersed by 24 h sonication. By several coating cycles,
uniform and dense CNT networks were expected. In each cycle,
about 0.5 mL of the CNT solution was ﬁrst dropped at the wafer
center, and then the wafer was spun by the spin speed of
100 rpm for 10 s and followed by a 120 C baking to evaporate
the DMF solvent entirely. The CNT networks formed on the wafer
after 40 cycles (20 mL) are shown in SEM image of Fig. 1c. From
several images, the average spin-coated CNT density per unit area
by the amount of 20 mL CNT solution could be approximated about
8.5 CNTs/lm2 by manually counting. The four-terminal bridge
resistors for conductance measurement were fabricated by depos-
iting 60 nm Pd/Ti metal with the ratio about 9/1 by a sputtering
technique and patterned by a lift off process. Finally, the CNT-
interconnect regimes were speciﬁed by O2 plasma etching. The
main process ﬂow of CNT-interconnect construction is illustrated
in Fig. 2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Conductance distribution of the CNT-interconnects
Fig. 3a and b shows the conductance distribution of the width
and length varying CNT-interconnects, respectively, fabricated by
the amount of 10 mL (20 coating cycles), 20 mL (40 coating cycles),
and 80 mL (160 coating cycles) CNT solution. The statistical distri-
bution shows that the conductance of every CNT-interconnect is
apparently enhanced by the increase of the times of coating cycles.
It can be understood that the more CNTs randomly distributed in
the CNT networks, the higher the probability for CNTs to connect
conductive paths. Moreover, the sheet conductance of the CNT-
interconnects formed by the amount of 10 mL, 20 mL, and 80 mL
CNT solution ranges from 3.42  106 to 8.05  105 S, 1.50 
105 to 1.21  104 S, and 7.40  105 to 2.09  104 S, respec-
tively. It is known that the interconnects between two metallic
or two semiconducting CNTs have lower resistances than a metal-
lic/semiconducting interface [30]. This would affect the conductiv-
ity of the CNT-interconnects because the carrier transportation in a
CNT random network is dominated by the Schottky emission [27].
It is noted that except for some points with extreme values, the
conductance variations of each size of CNT-interconnect mostly be-
come narrow as the times of coating cycle increase. Additionally,
most of the CNT-interconnects fabricated by the amount of
80 mL CNT solution have the conductance variation around one or-
der. These results verify that the CNT network is effective to lower
the variation as the CNT density increases in the interconnect re-
gime. These results further show that the CNT-interconnects with
the size of L W = 1000 lm  5 lm are probable to be conductive
and possess the average conductance approximately 5.22  107 S
as shown in Fig. 3b.
Compare Fig. 3a with b, under the same square number of CNT-
interconnects and the same coating cycles for CNT networks for-
mation, the CNT-interconnects with a smaller area of interconnect
regime mostly possess lower conductance and larger variation. The
results could be interpreted that the spin coating technique and
the 1-nm-thick layer of Al2O3 could facilitate the uniformity of
CNT dispersion on the wafer, but the distribution of CNT conduc-
tive paths within the speciﬁc CNT-interconnects with the same
square number might not be the same once the interconnect re-
gimes were speciﬁed. In terms of the probability, the CNT-inter-
connects with larger interconnect area is likely to contain more
end to end CNT conductive paths.

As determined in percolation theory, a = 1.33 is for a two dimen-
sional ﬁlm [33]. The formula (1) was applied to ﬁt the relation be-
tween the average conductance and the square number of the
width varying CNT-interconnect as shown in Fig. 5. The proportion-
ality constants corresponding to 10 mL, 20 mL, and 80 mL CNT solu-
tion for the CNT network formation are 1.53  105, 1.33  104
and 4.25  104, respectively. These proportionality constants are
mainly involved with CNT self-resistance and tube-to-tube contact
resistance, and this resistance originates from CNT diameter, spe-
cies, chirality and defects, etc. [34]. Therefore, research has only dis-
cussed the critical density. In 2004, Hu et al. investigated the
percolation phenomena in an ensemble of CNTs by using a ﬁltration
method to ﬁlter a dilute suspension of nanotubes in a solvent over a
porous alumina ﬁltration membrane (length 3 mm and width
5 mm) [35]. With the times of vacuum ﬁltering increasing, more
and more CNTs were stuck on the membrane and resulted in higher
and higher probability of formation of CNT connected conductive
paths. Eventually, they obtained the percolative relation between
the conductance of the CNT networks on the porous alumina ﬁltra-
tion membrane with cumulative CNT density. In our experiment,
because of the thin layer of Al2O3 under the CNT networks, the CNTs
would uniformly spread on the wafer by spin coating. Furthermore,
CNT densities fabricated by slow spin rate coating were expected to
be very dense, so CNTs per unit area could be reasonably assumed
as constant. However, such high density CNT networks were difﬁ-
cult to assess the density by manually counting, so we made a rea-
sonable assumption that the average CNT density per unit area is

This paper mainly focuses on the conductive mechanism and
interconnect structure design of CNT-interconnects, and the reli-
ability of CNT-interconnects is a critical issue and worth further
researching. According to our preliminary experiments for CNT-
interconnect reliability test, we discovered that the disconnection
occurred at the contact between metal pad and CNTs, not at CNT
tubes after long-time ejection of current through the CNT-inter-
connect. It is mainly because of that current crowding caused by
the large difference between the width of a metal pad and the total
width of CNTs. This non-homogeneous current density ﬁnally leads
to electromigration at the metal/CNT contact.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we used slow spin rate coating and dry etching to
fabricate the CNT-interconnects with various sizes. The size effect
and the correlation between the size effect and the times of coating
cycles were investigated. The results show that not only the
amount of the CNT solution coated for forming the CNT network,
but also the area of CNT-interconnect regime would affect the con-
ductance, variation, and conductive probability of CNT-intercon-
nects. Next, the yield of working CNT-interconnects does not
show direct relation between the conductive probability with the
times of coating cycles for CNT network formation. Finally, the
power ﬁtting approach applied to the average conductance and
the reciprocal of the square number of CNT-interconnects under
different conditions was shown and interpreted by percolation
theory. In addition, we classiﬁed the characteristics of the average
conductance of CNT-interconnects with different sizes into three
categories: percolation region, power region and linear region.
The phase transition phenomena were also demonstrated with
the increase of the times of coating cycles. As the density of the
CNT network increases continually, the conductance would enter
the linear region and behaves as a conventional resistor.

great enhancement. Next, the size-dependently percolative 
characteristics of the CNT-interconnect conductance were 
demonstrated. At final, the conduction of 1000-μm-long

Abstract 
Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is a promising next 
generation lithography technology. In this paper, EUV 
irradiation damage effect on the reliability of the metal 
gate/high dielectric constant (high-k) dielectric MOSFET is 
evaluated.  State-of-the-art nMOSFET is investigated by 
positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) measurement 
before and after irradiation. It is observed that the influence of 
the irradiation is much weaker than the PBTI stress itself so 
that the ionizing radiation does not affect the PBTI reliability 
of the state-of-the-art nMOSFET significantly. 
Keywords: PBTI, EUV, Irradiation 
Introduction 
Recently, extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography 
technology achieves great progress. Several pre-production 
tools have been delivered since 2010 and several full-field 
EUVL technologies have been demonstrated [1-5]. However, 
the energy of EUV light is higher than most radiations 
generated by conventional IC processes. Our previous study 
observed that oxide traps, border traps, and interface traps 
would be generated by extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) irradiation 
in various high dielectric constant (high-k) gate dielectrics 
[6-8]. The reliability issues of high-k materials are related to 
the interfacial layer as well as the high-k dielectrics layer. 
Generally, the PBTI degradation of nMOSFET is more severe 
than the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) of 
pMOSFET with high-k gate dielectric [9-12]; hence this work 
investigates the PBTI degradation after EUV and X-ray 
irradiation. 
Experiments 
The device used in this study is planar structure n-channel 
MOSFET fabricating by the gate last process. The isolation 
technique is shallow trench isolation (STI) and the Ni-silicide 
was formed on source/drain to reduce the parasitic resistance. 
The materials of gate electrode and gate dielectric are TiN and 
Hf-based dielectric, respectively. The gate dielectrics consist 
of a 2-nm-thick HfO2 and a 0.2-nm-thick interfacial oxide. 
Fig.1 shows the cross-sectional structure of the gate stack. 
Irradiation was conducted at the National Synchrotron 
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. In 
this work, the beamline 08A1 was used for EUV experiments 
and the beamline 07A was used for 10 keV X-ray experiments.  
Results and Discussion 
Figs.2 and 3 shows the typical transfer characteristics of 
devices experienced EUV and X-ray irradiation, respectively. 
The threshold voltage shift is less than 10 mV and the 
subthreshold swing (S.S.) degradation is negligible. The 
increase of off-state current is explained by the interface states 
generated at the field oxide/Si substrate interface and the 
trapped charges in field oxide. It seems that EUV irradiation 
produces heavier damage than X-ray irradiation. This 
phenomenon can be explained by the higher absorption 
coefficient of EUV in field oxide. 
Figs.4 and 5 show the Id-Vg curves after PBTI stress at room 
temperature and 150 C, respectively. It is observed that the 
Vth shifts toward positive in parallel, and the S.S. does not 
change a lot after stress. It implies that the main mechanism of 
PBTI is due to oxide trapped charge. Besides, the Vth 
degradation at 150 C is more apparent than at room 
temperature. The average Vth shift after 104 s stress is about 30 
mV at room temperature, and about 90 mV at 150 C. It means 
that high temperature stress may cause severe electro-chemical 
effect in the gate dielectric, and generate more defects. All of 
the above observations are consistent with those reported in 
literature. 
Figs. 6-11 show the distribution of Vth degradation without 
irradiation, after EUV irradiation to a dose of 1000 mJ/cm2, 
and after 10 keV X-ray irradiation to a dose of 1000 mJ/cm2 at 
room temperature and 150 C. Fig. 12 compares the average 
Vth degradation without irradiation and after irradiation to a 
dose of 1000 mJ/cm2 by different radiation sources. It is 
observed that the distributions of the Vth after EUV and 10 keV 
X-ray irradiation are nearly equal to that of the samples 
without irradiation both at room temperature and 150 C. 
In fact, the state-of-the-art nMOSFET offers excellent 
radiation hardness, the gate dielectric is damaged slightly by 
EUV and 10 keV X-ray irradiation. The Vth shift is only 
several mV after irradiation; nonetheless, the Vth shift is much 
larger for the sample under PBTI stress than exposing under 
ionizing radiation. For example, after a 100 s PBTI stress at 
room temperature, the average Vth shift is 15 mV which is 
about two or three times larger than that after ionizing 
radiation exposure. In other words, on the part of device’s 
damage, the influence of PBTI stress is much evident than 
ionizing radiation. 
Conclusions 
In summary, we investigate the PBTI reliability of the 
state-of-the-art nMOSFET after irradiation by EUV and X-ray. 
It is observed that no matter what radiation source is used, the 
distribution of Vth degradation is nearly the same either at 
room temperature or at 150 C. This result implies that the 
ionizing radiation do not affect directly on the PBTI reliability 
of the state-of-the-art nMOSFET.
