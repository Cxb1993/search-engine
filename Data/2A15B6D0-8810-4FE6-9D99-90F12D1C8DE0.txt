2. Abstract 
 
The project of demonstration and analysis of micro proton exchange 
membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack performance, assembling and durability tests. 
The present study was designed to fabricate a micro PEM fuel cell stack in-house 
through a deep UV lithography technique and the SU-8 photoresist was used as 
microstructure mold for fuel cell bipolar plates/flow channel plates. In the present 
study, the micro PEM fuel cell stack performance test (VI/PI curve) was carried out to 
get in situ information on examining the effect of the serpentine flow channel patterns, 
as well as the operational parameters such as different cell number (single cell、2-cell 
and 3-cell stacks), and different channel-to-rib width ratio (2、1 and 0.5) of micro 
PEM fuel cell stack. The experimental results are presented in the form of polarization 
curves (VI/PI curve) under above operating conditions. In the present study, 3-cell 
stack performance, at an output stack voltage of 1.5 V, 110 mA/cm2 current density 
and 150 mW/cm2 maximum power were found under the channel-to-rib width ratio 1 
and stack temperature 25 oC, with reaction gas flow ratio of 10 sccm and 60 sccm on 
anode and cathode, respectively, at same anode and cathode back pressure of 97 kPa. 
The influence of the aforementioned parameters was presented and discussed. 
 
 
3. Introduction 
 
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks are currently 
considered suitable candidates to power stationary or mobile applications, especially 
cell phone and laptop, due to their high performance, high power density, and low 
 3
z Different cell number and different channel-to-rib width ratio of micro PEM fuel 
cell stack 
Flowfield configuration seems the greatly affect both the gas diffusion and 
electric conduction. Quick gas diffusion favors wider channel (narrower rib) width of 
flow channels. In the present study, for a higher electric conduction, a narrower 
channel of flowfield configuration is needed to achieve a higher electric conduction. 
Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the geometric parameters involved with flow 
channels such as the flow channel type, the channel-to-rib width ratio, the rib shape, 
and the diffusion layer thickness on cell performance. In the present study, we will 
focus on three different 5 cm2 flow channel patterns with various rib widths for three 
cell number of micro PEM fuel cell stacks. The different channel-to-rib width ratio 
and different cell number are detailed listed in Table2. 
 
z Performance test 
The electrode-electrolyte assemblies were investigated in a fuel cell stacks. 
Steady state performance was achieved by operating the fuel cell with pure hydrogen 
and air feed. In the typical vertical series fuel cell stacks (single cell、2-cell stack and 
3-cell stack), the performance test with different channel-to-rib with ratio (0.5、1 and 2) 
in stack temperature of 25 oC at same anode and cathode back pressure of 97 kPa. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
z Electroforming bipolar plate design and fabrication 
Fig. 1 show, utilize electroforming of bipolar plate/flow channel plate employ 
deep UV lithography was proposed which is also quite similar to that reported in [1]. 
SU 8 materials were chosen for prototypal complex geometric structures for flow 
channels. All samples had an active area of 2.25 cm long and 2.25 cm wide (5cm2). 
 
z Types of stack design in vertical series and different cell number and different 
channel-to-rib width ratio of micro PEM fuel cell stack 
Fig. 2 shows, the conventional vertical stack design and different cell number 
(2-cell and 3-cell) of micro PEM fuel cell stacks. For small power applications, these 
planar designs (planar flip-flop and banded) can have advantages in terms of power 
density, manufacturability, and packaging flexibility. However, the series combination 
of multiple cells on a single membrane can also lead to complications. Some of these 
disadvantages include the potentially higher ohmic resistance of planar interconnected 
cells, and the increase difficulty of ensuring equal reactant distribution to multiple 
cells in a plane.
