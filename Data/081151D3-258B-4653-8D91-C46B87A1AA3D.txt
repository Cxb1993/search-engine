1. Introduction 
Neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs) possess the ability to self-renew and 
generate the three characteristic cell types of central nervous system (CNS): neurons, 
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [1, 2]. Regulating neural lineage differentiation from 
NSPCs is a challenge of neuroscience research. Many investigators have concentrated 
on elucidating the role of extrinsic and intrinsic signals coming from medium 
components, culture substrates, and intercellular interactions in the regulation of 
behaviors of NSPCs [3, 4]. Serum is a complex mixture containing a variety of 
components with different molecular weights. It has been shown that NSPCs are 
influenced by a numerous of factors in serum including various growth factors, 
cytokines, neurotransmitters, proteins, and polyamines [5]. Furthermore, many 
components in serum might have a synergistic effect to influence stem cells. For 
example, Choi et al. showed that combinations of basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF) and insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) had an additive effect on neural 
differentiation. [6]. Kokuzawa et al. reported that addition of hepatocyte growth factor 
(HGF) to medium containing bFGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased the 
promoting effect of HGF on the proliferation of NSPCs [7]. Pachernik et al. showed 
that mouse embryonic stem cells cultured in the media with insulin, transferrin, 
selenium, and fibronectin preferentially supported the development of neural cells [8]. 
Our previous reports have demonstrated that NSPCs were principally induced to 
differentiate into astrocytes when the medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) in the absence of additional growth factors[4, 9-12]. Therefore, NSPCs can be 
cultured to divide continuously or to enhance the differentiation of more NSPCs into 
neurons in serum-free medium supplemented with various growth factors, but such a 
culture condition is not available in the biological environment. Up to now, serum 
components have never been systematically identified how they influence NSPC 
phenotypic choice. In order to determine the compositions in serum which are 
responsible for the NSPC fate specification, FBS was divided into different molecular 
weight fractions by filtration. The effect of serum fractions on proliferation, 
differentiation and migration of NSPCs from embryonic rat cerebral cortex were 
measured, and compared to that of whole serum, which dominate non-neural lineage 
differentiation. It was found only high molecular weight molecules in serum 
possessed the similar differentiation-promoting effect to whole serum. Conversely, 
low molecular weight serum fraction had the proliferation-promoting effect, and 
comparable to a mitogenic action of bFGF. Interestingly, serum fraction even could 
change the role of bFGF from promoting NSPC proliferation to inducing neural 
differentiation pathway. It was hoped that, studying the roles of serum fractions in the 
process of neurogenesis might serve as an experimental system for simplification of 
 
2.3. Preparation of culture media and cell culture 
High and low molecular weight molecules of whole fetal bovine serum were 
removed by centrifugation in a the manufacturer's instructions with different 
molecular weight exclusion of below 3 kDa (3KD), 3 kDa to 50 kDa (3K-50K), below 
50 kDa (50KD), 50 kDa to 100 kDa (50K-100K), below 100 kDa (100KD) and above 
100 kDa (100KU) (Amicon® Ultra, Millipore, MA) for a total of 50 min at 2600 g at 
room temperature to obtain serum fractions. The serum fractions were reconstituted 
with sterilizing double-deionized water to the original volume. And then, 
neurospheres cultured in DMEM-F12 containing 3KD, 3K-50K, 50KD, 50K-100K, 
100KD, 100KU, and control medium, DMEM-F12 (DM) and DMEM-F12 containing 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence or absence of bFGF 20ng/ml. 
To assess the proliferation abilities of media, above descried, in the presence or 
absence of bFGF on the number of neurospheres. Neurospheres were culture in 24 
well culture plates at 70±9 neurospheres/well. After 3d of incubation, the 
neurospheres were counted and under a phase-contrast microscope (IX71, Olympus, 
Japan). 
 
2.4. Immunocytochemistry 
For immunocytochemical characterization, cultured cells were fixed in ice-cold 
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed three times in PBS at indicated 
time points. After fixing, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS 
containing 0.5% Triton-X-100 and 10% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 ℃. The 
primary antibodies and their dilution used in this study were mouse 
anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 polyclonal antibody (anti-MAP2; 1:250; 
Millipore, Bedford, MA), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein polyclonal antibody 
(anti-GFAP; 1:250; Millipore, Bedford, MA) [17-19]. FITC- and Rhodamine- 
conjugated secondary antibodies were used to visualize the signal by reacting with 
cells for 1.5 hr at room temperature. The secondary antibodies and their dilution were 
FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (preabsorbed with rabbit and rat serum 
protein; 1:50; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse 
IgG (preabsorbed with rabbit and rat serum protein; 1:50; Millipore, Bedford, MA). 
Cells were also counterstained with DAPI. These immunostained cells were 
visualized by indirect fluorescence under the fluorescent microscope (Lieca DMI600, 
Germany). 
For quantification of immunocytochemical procedures, the quantitative analysis 
were used a microscope (Lieca DMI600, Germany) collocated with standard 
fluorescence illumination and a digital camera (Lieca DFC360 FX, Germany). A total 
fasciculated feature in presence of FBS was different from that grown in the high 
molecular weight fraction of serum. 
Because these cultures represent a heterogeneous population of cells at different 
stages of neuronal and glial development, immunocytochemical staining with neuron 
marker MAP2 and astrocyte marker GFAP was performed to analyze differentiated 
cell phenotypes [18, 19]. As shown in Figure 2, both antibodies indicated positive 
results for neurospheres cultured in the presence of FBS and 100KU after 7 days of 
incubation. Thus, when serum or its fraction with high molecular weight molecules 
more than 100 kDa was present, the differentiated MAP2-positive neurons and 
GFAP-positive astrocytes could be obtained. Furthermore, MAP2- and GFAP-positive 
cells from an independent neurosphere were counted to quantify the number of 
differentiated cell phenotypes in different culture medium. Figure 3 shows, after 7 
days of incubation, there was no significant difference in cell phenotypes between the 
addition of FBS or 100KU into the culture medium. The average percentages of 
differentiated neurons and astrocytes were 26.5±3.1% and 73.5±3.1% in FBS, and 
33.8±6.8% and 66.2±6.8% in 100KU. In addition, only a small proportion of the cells 
were not stained by any of the used markers. 
When bFGF was not present, differentiated cells would not migrate out of 
neurospheres to reach confluence after 7 days of incubation. Conversely, under the 
activation of bFGF, these cells revealed an enhanced migratory capacity, and would 
migrate far away from the neurospheres to reach confluence after 7 days of culture, as 
shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, these cells were identified as either neurons 
(anti-MAP2) or astrocytes (anti-GFAP) cells (Figure 5). Interestingly, when bFGF 
was added into the culture medium in the presence of 100KU, more neurons were 
obtained (Figure 6). The percentage of differentiated neurons was slightly increased 
from 33.8±6.8% without bFGF to 40.8±2.3% with bFGF, indicating bFGF had a little 
effect on NSPCs differentiating into neurons in the presence of 100KU. 
 
3.2. Behavior of neurospheres cultured in the presence of serum fraction with 
molecular weights less than 100 kDa (3KD, 3K-50K, 50KD, 50K-100K and 100KD) 
Conversely, neurospheres did not attach onto the TCPS surface when the 
medium contained serum components with molecular weight less than 100 kDa, as 
shown in Figure 7. After 3 days of culture, it seemed that some serum fractions could 
promote the proliferation of NSPCs. Compared to neurospheres grown in DMEM-F12 
without the addition of any serum fraction (70±16 neurospheres/well), significantly 
higher neurosphere numbers 123±10, 92±9 and 104±7 neurospheres/well were found 
for 3KD, 3K-50K and 50K-100K, respectively (p<0.05). Since the majority of cells in 
the sphere were immunoreactive for nestin (not shown here), neurosphere cells were 
functional presynaptic terminals before and 150 s after the start of stimulation. 
Qualitatively, the fluorescence of synaptic puncta on all substrates was lowered after 
150 s of stimulation. In order to measure the quantity of the difference in fluorescence 
intensity between fully stained and fully destained puncta (150s after the start of KCl 
stimulation), 12 random fields were recorded. Compared to FBS, Figure 10 (b) shows 
the decrease in the rate of FM1-43 unloading in differentiated neurons was 
considerably enhanced by serum fractions 3K-50K, 50KD, 50K-100K, and 100KD in 
the presence of bFGF after 7 days of incubation. 
 
3.4. Behaviors of neurospheres on different substrates 
Figure 11(a) shows photomicrographs of neurospheres cultured on PVDF, EVAL, 
and PVA in the medium containing serum fraction 100KD and bFGF. Neurospheres 
attached onto all substrates and forming-neurosphere cells migrated out with the 
typically differentiated processes during the 7-day culture period. Compared to PVA, 
PVDF and EVAL were able to induce more cells to migrate out from their original 
aggregates. Figure 11 (b) shows that the extending processes and migrating cells 
consisted of GFAP-positive astrocytes and MAP2-positive neurons simultaneously. 
Figure 11(c) shows their quantification analysis. Similar to neurospheres culture on 
TCPS, more differentiated neurons were observed on all substrates. 
 
4. Discussion 
It is well known that most types of normal cells require attachment to a substrate 
to be able to survive and grow, and that this dependence on anchorage is reduced in 
malignantly transformed cells [21]. NSPCs can proliferate in suspension to form 
neurospheres that do not need to attach onto the substrate surface [2], thus, can be 
considered as anchorage-independent cells. On the other hand, neurospheres are 
considered as the anchorage-dependent cells, which differentiate into different cell 
types when they attach onto the substrate under appropriate conditions. The factors 
responsible for suspension (or proliferation) and adhesion (or differentiation) of 
NSPCs has been the subject of intense investigation. These factors include extrinsic 
signals coming from various diffusible factors [1-6, 20] and interactions between 
NSPCs and substrates [4, 9-12] to either augment or inhibit cellular proliferation or to 
impart new functional capabilities of NSPCs. Serum is a complex mixture, which has 
been demonstrated to induce the adhesion of NSPCs to differentiate into 
GFAP-positive astrocytes predominantly [4, 10, 11]. It is reasonable to assume not 
whole serum, but just part of serum compositions is responsible for the NSPC fate 
determination. Therefore, it is interesting to study whether the interaction of NSPCs 
with different serum fractions can direct cells to attach onto the substrate surface or to 
remarkably, bFGF successfully increased the percentage of differentiated neurons 
from 33.8±6.8% without bFGF to 40.8±2.3% with bFGF in the medium-containing 
serum molecules of more than 100 kDa (Figures 4-6). However, more interestingly, 
instead of promoting NSPC proliferation, when serum fractions with molecular 
weights between 3 and 100 kDa were added into the bFGF-containing medium, 
NSPCs rapidly attached onto the TCPS surface and more than 50% migrating-out 
cells were predominantly induced into mature neurons (Figure 9). In addition, bFGF 
could enhance migratory capacity of differentiated cells when the medium contained 
higher molecular weight fractions (Figures 4 and 9). Compared to whole serum, about 
2 times decreased percentages of FM1-43 fluorescence intensity in differentiated 
neurons by serum fractions 3K-50K, 50KD, 50K-100K, and 100KD in the presence of 
bFGF (Figure 10), indicating higher and better neuron function. Therefore, there was 
a significant synergism between bFGF and different serum fractions to exert 
progression effects on NSPC differentiation into MAP2-positive neurons with the 
neuronal-network structure. 
 Finally, the result of differentiated neurons dominating the pattern of NSPC 
growth could be applied to other biomaterial substrates (Figure 11). In our previous 
studies, PVDF, EVAL and PVA with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties 
could exert different influences on NSPC fate specification [11, 12], but the combined 
administration of bFGF and serum molecules with molecular weight between 3 and 
100 kDa significantly altered NSPC phenotypic choice. More differentiated neurons 
were observed on all substrates, which is different from biomaterial itself inducing 
non-neural differentiation pathways in cultured NSPCs or inhibiting NSPC 
suspension. This suggests that substrates cannot solely influence the behavior of 
NSPCs. Therefore, the behavior of NSPCs is versatile, which is dependent on the 
complex environmental conditions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The present study demonstrated that both proliferation- and 
differentiation-promoting molecules were present in the serum, which could be 
simply divided by molecular weight. In addition, serum fraction with molecular 
weights between 3 and 100 kDa could interact synergistically with bFGF to exert 
progression effects on NSPC differentiation into more MAP2-positive neurons. These 
results are very encouraging since this information should be useful for the 
development of strategies for controlling the behaviors determination of NSPCs in 
neuroscience research.

二、與會心得 
第一次出國參加國際研討會，雖然下了很多工夫在準備投影片上，口說方面
仍然略顯有點緊張，短短十分鐘的口頭報告可以再在更流利，但也體會到不同於
