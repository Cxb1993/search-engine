round in the protocol and an additional preparation 
phase before the beginning of the first round. In the 
period of preparation phase, all nodes initially 
perform cluster head selection process and then send 
their messages with statuses of being a candidate 
cluster head or not, node IDs, and geographical 
positions to the base station. As the base station 
received the messages from all nodes, it then 
searches for an optimal probability of nodes being 
cluster heads via a genetic algorithm by minimizing 
the total energy consumption required for completing 
one round in the sensor field. The preparation phase 
is performed only once before the set-up phase of the 
first round. The selected CHs broadcast advertisement 
messages to all common nodes, which are the nodes 
without claiming as CHs themselves, in order to form 
clusters. In our protocol, the efficient transmission 
routing is achieved via the cooperation of CH, 
aggregation node (AN) and transmission node (TN) in 
every round. The AN is chosen by the CH if it is 
located near the geometric center of the cluster and 
its residual energy level is over the average of the 
cluster, and TN is also chosen by the CH if it has a 
maximum residual energy in the cluster. At steady-
state phase, alive nodes in each cluster transmitted 
their sensed data to the AN of the cluster first, and 
then the AN aggregated the received data and 
transmitted the aggregated data to the TN of the 
cluster. At the end of steady-state phase, the TN is 
responsible for transmitting all data packets 
received from the AN to the base station (BS). The 
proposed transmission routing will effectively 
amortize the loads by the synergy of CHs, ANs, and 
TNs, and resulting in an extension of lifetime for 
the network. Moreover, the energy dissipation in 
transmitting/receiving a large size of cluster＇s 
data will be effectively shared out among nodes in 
rotation.

41 Introduction
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been
extensively applied in tactical combat situations,
habitat monitoring, home security, and so on [1-3].
Considering that a wireless sensor network is
composed of a large number of tiny sensor nodes with
limited energy, an energy-efficient network protocol is
one of the essentials in the WSN design. As reviewing
the proposed protocols in the literature, cluster-based
communication protocols can produce superior
performance to achieve more balanced patterns of
energy use in WSNs [4]. The well-known cluster-based
communication protocol was Heinzelman et al.’s
LEACH, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy [5,
6], which energy loads could be well amortized by
periodically creating a small number of clusters based
on a threshold function T(s) with a priori probability p
(say, 5%), in the set-up phase. The technique uses
cluster heads (CHs) to aggregate the sensed data from
member nodes and forward the aggregated data to base
station (BS). Simulation results in [5, 6] show that
sensor nodes in the sensor field tend to dissipate the
same level of energy over time since the CHs are
dynamically rotated among nodes. However, LEACH
uses a threshold function parameterized by a
probability p that is needed to specify by user. The
performance of sensor network is sensitive to the value
of p. When p is large, many clusters are formed as a
result of high energy consumption since many CHs
could dissipate more energy in transmitting aggregated
data to the BS. On the other hand, when p is small,
only a few clusters are formed, which could increase
energy dissipation of member nodes in transmitting
sensed data to CHs. Accordingly, some researchers
presented that the optimal value popt depends on
parameters such as the total number of nodes
distributed in the sensor field, the size of sensor field,
the location of BS, and so on [7, 8]. Therefore, present
work proposes a genetic algorithm-based (GA-based)
energy-efficiency via role sharing protocol, termed
ERoS-GA, to predict the optimal values of probability
effectively for WSN applications.
1.1 ERoS: An energy-efficiency via role sharing
protocol
LEACH as we know it is a stochastic cluster head
selection algorithm shown in Fig. 1, which CHs are
selected dynamically and periodically according to a
threshold function in every round. The operation of
LEACH is employed via several rounds, each round
consisting of set-up and steady-state phases. In the set-
up phase, the sensor field is divided into a small
number of clusters. Each cluster includes a CH and
several member nodes. Thereafter, in the steady-state
phase, each member node transmits its collected data
form surroundings to the closest CH, and then each
CH receives and aggregates the data from its cluster
members and forwards the aggregated data to the BS
through a single-hop relay. It is clearly that each CH in
LEACH is responsible for cluster management, as well
as data aggregation and transmission. This places an
excessive energy burden on the CH. Therefore, most
protocols try to distribute this energy burden across the
network by rotating the CH role between nodes chosen
either randomly, or according to some residual-energy
metric. However, the use of residual energy in CH
selection still yields sub-optimal energy balance and
network lifetimes. Based on this insight, we proposed
a new protocol called ERoS (Energy-efficiency via
Role Sharing) protocol in the previous work [9]. In the
ERoS protocol, CHs are selected randomly based on a
probability p in each round, yet achieves excellent
energy balance by off-loading the data aggregation and
transmission functions to other selected nodes. The
role of CHs is just to form clusters. Data aggregation
within each cluster is performed by an aggregation
node, and data transmission to BS by a transmission
node.

Each round in ERoS is divided into set-up and
steady-state phases, just as in LEACH. The selection
of CHs is determined purely using a probability value
p. At the beginning of set-up phase, each sensor node
picks a random number t in the interval [0, 1]. If t < p,
the node advertises itself as a CH. Since CHs in ERoS
are randomly selected, based only on a specified
parameter p, several CHs could be located near each
other, causing a local imbalance in energy

3 Analysis of energy dissipation in ERoS
We use a first-order radio model [5] in analyzing
ERoS protocol. The parameter values used in our
simulation model are listed in Table I. According to
the radio energy dissipation model illustrated in Fig. 3,
the energy required by the transmit amplifier ETx(l,d)
for transmitting a l-bit message over a distance d
between a transmitter and a receiver is given by

Comparing (10) and (12), we can see that although
ERoS increases required power by eleclkE2 , this
increase is small, since number of cluster k is small.
However, it reduces the energy consumption roughly

4 Analysis of optimal number of cluster
in ERoS
From the mathematical expressions of (10), the
total energy consumption TotalE is a function of the
number of clusters k. Assuming that nkn  )( , the
analytical optimal solution for k can be obtained via
setting the derivative of TotalE to k equal to zero.
Therefore, the optimal number of clusters (kopt) and
probability for generating CHs (popt) can be formulated
as

Clearly, the value of kopt is approximated as 2/1
times the value of LEACH-GA presented in Ref. [10].

Equation (16) states that the parameter popt is just
function of the total number of sensor nodes only when
the BS located at the center of sensor field. Namely,
the value of probability at the center of sensor field is
independent of the domain size.
5 Genetic algorithm-based clustering
At the beginning of preparation phase, each node
initially determines whether or not it should be a
candidate cluster head (CCH), using the following
cluster head selection procedure. First, every sensor
node selects a random number r from the interval [0,
1]. If r is smaller than pset, based on a prescribed
probability pset, then the node is a CCH. The value of
pset can be a large value in our protocol, pset=0.5 for
example. Thereafter, each node sends its ID, location
information, and whether or not it is a CCH to the BS.
As the BS receives messages sent by all nodes, it
performs GA operations to determine the optimal
probability, popt= kopt/n, by minimizing the total
amount of energy consumption in each round.
Therefore, the objective function used in the GA can
be formulated as

The values of xc are

is zero. The parameters =fs and =2 were used for
d<d0; while, =mp and =4 were set for dd0. The
symbol q represents the number of member nodes in a
cluster. The optimal probability popt is determined by
the 2/1 times the value of obtain from GA based on
(14). Once the optimal probability popt is found, the BS
broadcasts the value of popt to all nodes. The set-up and
steady-state phases begin. The procedures of set-up and
steady-state phase are the same as in LEACH.

7 Conclusions
This paper proposed a GA-based ERoS protocol,
termed ERoS-GA, to determine the optimal probability
for cluster formation in WSNs. The LEACH or
previous proposed ERoS protocol requires the user to
specify a probability to determine whether a node
becomes a CH or not. Considering that the probability
value (p) for forming clusters in the protocols is
difficult to obtain an optimum setting from available
prior knowledge. Thus, we designed an additional
preparation phase prior to the set-up phase of the first
round in the ERoS-GA protocol to gather information
about node status, IDs, and location and send it to the
BS, which determines the optimal probability to use in
the CH selection mechanism. Results showed that the
distributions of optimum probability obtained using
ERoS-GA was comparable to that of energy model
analysis for BS located at different positions in the two

datasets. Although the data mining has several different definitions from the scholars, its purpose is
discovering useful knowledge and information from database. Generally, data mining technologies include
(1) Associate Rules, (2) Classification, (3) Clustering Analysis, (4) Regression Analysis, (5) Particle Swarm
Optimization and (6) Time Series Analysis, and so on [4, 12]. This work proposes two kinds of EvoDM
algorithms, which combines a clustering algorithm, K-means, with two evolutionary algorithms, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) and Momentum Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO). The below introduce clustering
analysis, GA, and MPSO.
2.1. Clustering Analysis
Clustering Analysis is a main method for exploring data mining and also is a common technique for
statistical data analysis. It can be applied to machine learning, image analysis, pattern recognition,
information retrieval, and bioinformatics. The K-means algorithm is the one of often used method in the
clustering algorithms. When the number of clusters is fixed to k, K-means algorithm gives a formal
definition as an optimization problem to specify k cluster centers and assign each instance to its belonging
cluster with the smallest distance from the instance to assigned cluster [4]. The flowchart of K-means
depicted in Fig. 1.

2.2. Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm is a stochastic search algorithm which based on the Darwinian principal of natural
selection and natural genetics. The selection is biased toward more highly fit individuals, so the average
fitness of the population tends to improve from one generation to the next. In general, GA generates an
optimal solution by means of using reproduction, crossover, and mutation operators [3, 9]. The fitness of the
best individual is also expected to improve over time, and the best individual may be selected as a solution
after several generations.
2.3. Particle Swarm Optimization
The PSO algorithm was first introduced by Kennedy and Eberharth [6] in 1995. The concept of PSO is
that each individual in PSO flies in the search space with a velocity which is dynamically adjusted according
to its own flying experience and its companions’flying experience. Each individual is treated as volume-less
particle in the D-dimensional search space. Shi and Eberhart modified the original PSO in 1999 [12]. The
equation is expressed as follows:

where 1c and 2c are the cognitive and social learning rates, respectively. The random function 1r and 2r are
uniformly distributed in the range [0, 1]. Equation (1) reveals that the large inertia weight promotes global
exploration, whereas the small value promotes a local search.

4.3. Case 2: initial cluster centers are determined by averaging training set
Table 5 lists the accuracy of three different algorithms for Case 2 which the initial centers are obtained
by averaging all training set for each attributes. The overall accuracy of using the three algorithms for the
case was higher than that of the previous one. Computational results also showed that the accuracy of
presented two EvoDM algorithms was better than that of K-means algorithm. Moreover, Table 6 lists the
optimal weights of six attributes obtained using GA-Kmeans and MPSO-Kmeans algorithms. The attributes
for claim amount and attorney were relatively significant than other attributes for determining the clusters.
5. Conclusion
This study introduced the K-means algorithm and two EvoDM algorithms including GA-Kmeans and
MPSO-Kmeans algorithms to the insurance fraud prediction. The two EvoDM algorithms were hybrid by
incorporating the K-means algorithm with GA and MPSO, respectively. Two initial cluster centers
conditions were studied to check the robustness of the algorithms. From our computational results, the
accuracy for test set prediction obtained using GA-Kmeans and MPSO-Kmeans algorithms was 86.325% for
Case 1 which the initial cluster centers were selected from training set randomly, whereas the accuracy
obtained using K-means algorithm was 37.9% only. From the weight distribution of Case 1, the attributes of
claim amount, claim times and attorney showed the relatively important in judging the insurance fraud.
Furthermore, this work made changes for the initial cluster centers, termed Case 2, by averaging all the data
training set for each attributes. The accuracy for test set prediction obtained using GA-Kmeans and MPSO-
Kmeans algorithms for Case 2 was significantly enhanced to 97.6% while the accuracy obtained using K-
means algorithm was 89.725%. From the weight distribution of Case 2, the attributes of claim amount and
attorney demonstrated relatively important in judging insurance fraud. Accordingly, the accuracy of
insurance fraud prediction can be enhanced by using the presented two EvoDM algorithms.
