1. Introduction 
In the past decades, efforts [1-3] on fundamental modeling of PEMFCs have 
been developed to better understand transport phenomena and performance of 
the cell.  
    Bernardi [4] proposed a one-dimensional mathematical model to describe 
the gas transport in electrodes, and the membrane was considered as uniformly 
wetted. Results showed that water balance in the fuel cells was extremely 
important. Imbalance between production and evaporation rates could result in 
either membrane dehydration by deficient water or flooding of the electrode by 
excessive water, and both of which affected the limiting current density. 
Temperatures, pressures, and gas flow rates of humid gases also influenced the 
cell. The lower current density, higher gas flow rate, lower humidity, higher 
temperature, and low pressure brought about deficient water in general. On the 
contrary, the higher current density, lower gas flow rate, higher humidity, 
lower temperature, and higher pressure brought about excessive water. When 
temperature is higher, the amount of evaporated water is higher and the current 
density of water balance is also higher, and liquid water reached balance when 
anode relative humidity was about 55%. Excessive humidification caused water 
transport to cathode side and resulted in flooding. In gas transport, since the 
hydrogen diffusivity was approximately seven folds than oxygen diffusivity, 
the hydrogen depletion gradient was so slight relative to oxygen depletion 
gradient. Hydrogen transport limitation was essential nonexistence in 
experiment. However it didn’t take liquid water into consideration and 
electrodes were free of water droplets.

membrane and electrodes became more vital in addition to activation 
overpotential. The study also indicated the effect of porosity and thickness of 
electrode on the limiting current density in the respect of mass transfer. With 
regard to the membrane, the cell performance was better with the thinner 
membrane. For different types of membranes, the Dow membrane had larger 
porosity and larger pore diameter than Nafion membrane and the performance 
of Dow membrane was superior, even though the Dow is thicker. 
    Springer et al. [7] presented a one-dimensional, isothermal, steady state 
model for the whole cell with Nafion 117 membrane. The study probed into the 
relation between water transport phenomenon and cell performance. Besides, 
water diffusion coefficient, membrane conductivity, electro-osmotic drag 
coefficient, and water sorption were functions of water content. Results 
revealed that the water content in the membrane decreased with increasing 
current density, and the membrane resistance increased. The membrane 
resistance decreased with increasing anode stoichiometry, and cell performance 
was better. With the raising inlet humidifier temperature, the membrane 
resistance increased with current density was lower, and the performance also 
promoted. For membrane thickness, the thinner membrane decreased resistance, 
and the ohmic loss in polarization curve was lower. All above analyses were 
confirmed experimentally.  
    Springer et al. [8] considered a fit between polarization curve of 
simulation and experiment for different cathode gas compositions of PEM fuel 
cells. The model used the effective oxygen concentration to simplify oxygen 
depletion along the channel. For polarization curves at different exchange 
current densities, higher exchange current density represented the chemical 
 6
low current density. With the increasing current density, the temperature profile 
between anode and cathode electrode was nearly linear, indicating heat 
conduction was predominant. Nevertheless, the temperature profile was 
no-linear in the membrane since there was heat generation. With reduced 
thermal conductivity, the temperature variation in the cell was higher, and it 
was very important for the design of fuel cell stacks. In the respect of 
humidification, results suggested that we should reduced humidification in the 
cathode at high current density if there was sufficient humidification in the 
anode 
    Singh et al. [11] extended [5] mathematical model, and presented a 
two-dimensional, isothermal model for complete fuel cell by finite volume 
method to discuss water management in PEM fuel cells. Results predicted that 
the polarization curve was lower than the one-dimension estimate as reactant 
gas was consumed along the channel. For different flow structures, co-flow 
case shifted the limiting current density to higher value. And higher 
stoichiometry also had higher limiting current density. For different electrode 
porosities, the mass transfer limitation took place at higher current density with 
increasing porosity, since transfer resistance was smaller. For water 
management, variation in current density influenced the water transport 
between anode and cathode side. At low current density, back diffusion took 
place and liquid water transported form cathode to anode. With the increasing 
current density, electro-osmotic drag dominated liquid water transport, and 
liquid water flowed from anode to cathode. At some transitional current density 
region, gas flow direction between inlet and outlet also differed. 
    With regard to analytical solution of mass transport in the PEM fuel cells, 
 8
layer was obtained by effective diffusion coefficient of liquid and gas. The 
study analyzed the operating parameters of the cell and compared with 
experimental data. Results revealed that flooding increased with increasing 
current density at low current density and the water generation increased. 
Nevertheless, with the increasing current density, flooding decreased due to 
higher water removal rate and then flooding decreased with increasing current 
density. For different operating temperatures, lower temperature brought about 
the flooding initiated at lower current density. For different operating pressure, 
the onset of flooding took place at lower current density with the increasing 
pressure. The use of air reduced electrode flooding as a result of higher gas 
flow rate. 
    Jordan et al. [15] discussed the effect of the gas diffusion layer on the cell 
performance experimentally. The electronic conductivity increased with 
increasing thickness of the gas diffusion layer. However, if the diffusion layer 
too thick, it would worsen gas diffusion properties as a result of longer path for 
gas diffusion. Sintering enabled the distribution of polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE) in the gas diffusion layer more uniform, and the gas diffusion layer was 
more hydrophobic. Hence the cell performance was better as water removal 
rate was higher.  
    Lim and Wang [16] studied the effect of hydrophobic polymer content in 
carbon paper on the performance of fuel cell experimentally. Results showed 
that contact angle decreased with increasing temperature. Surface morphology 
of carbon paper was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and was 
crucial to the cell performance. When fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) 
content in carbon paper ranged form 10 to 40wt.%, the difference in contact 
 10
showed that current density increased with increasing pressure drop between 
inlet and outlet channel as gas flow rate was higher. For electrode thickness, 
thicker electrode thickness increased gas flow rate at the same pressure drop. 
However, the effective oxygen concentration at catalyst site reduced when 
electrode thickness was too thick and the average current density decreased. 
The cell performance improved with increasing number of channels, thinner 
shoulder width, for a fixed area. However, the manufacturing cost increased 
with increasing number of channels. For different ratios between the channel 
and shoulder widths, shorter shoulder width was favorable to get higher 
performance. 
    Natarajan and Nguyen [19] developed a two-dimensional, two-phase, 
multicomponent, transient model in PEM fuel cell using conventional gas 
distributor. The gas transport was expressed by multicomponent diffusion 
equation, and liquid water transport was defined by Darcy’s equation. From 
transient profile, it was seen that liquid water transport in the cathode was 
sluggish, and was the main reason for transport limitation. Gas transport was 
quite fast so the time to reach steady state was shorter, and the slower transport 
of liquid water was crucial to reach a new steady state in the transient analysis. 
The cell performance increased with increasing operating temperature as the 
transport limitation reduced. This was compound effect of higher 
electrochemical reaction, higher rate of evaporation, higher diffusion 
coefficient, higher saturated pressure, and smaller amount of liquid water in the 
electrode. At lower current density, increasing humidity of the inlet stream 
decreased membrane dehydration. However, the cell performance decreased 
with increasing humidity of the inlet stream at high current density since the 
 12
relative humidity exceeded 100%, vapor concentration in the GDL was 
calculated by saturation pressure which was function of temperature, and water 
was considered only as vapor when relative humidity was smaller than 100%. 
Liquid water transport was expressed by viscous forces and capillary pressure 
terms, and the cell performance was affected by liquid water. Results showed 
that liquid water saturation didn’t exceed 10% at both anode and cathode side, 
and increased non-linearly with current density. GDL permeability was found a 
crucial parameter, and liquid water saturation in the electrode increased with 
decreasing permeability. 
Nam and Kaviany [22] developed one-dimensional mathematic model in 
hydrophobic porous media to describe liquid water transport. The effective 
diffusion coefficient was functions of the porosity and liquid water saturation. 
The cell performance decreased with increasing liquid water saturation as the 
effective diffusion coefficient was reduced. With regard to liquid water 
transport, the model considered both micro- and macro- transport 
simultaneously. Capillary flow was considered in macro-transport, and 
condensation was considered in micro-transport. The effect of fiber diameter, 
porosity, and capillary force on the cell performance was also observed in this 
study. Finally, the effect of bi-layer diffusion media on liquid water saturation 
was explored and the design details on reduced liquid water saturation were 
suggested.  
Siegel et al. [23] presented a two-dimensional, computational, steady state 
model in PEM fuel cells including liquid water transport. Model showed the 
importance of liquid water transport in porous media. Liquid water was 
transported by capillary force and mass transfer between different phases. 
 14
results showed that gravitational effect in two-phase region was negligible 
since Bond number, ratio of gravitational and surface tension forces, was about 
0.04. The convection effect was negligible in the single-phase region but was 
significant in the two-phase region since the Peclet number of gas transport was 
0.08 and 0.32 for single-phase and two-phase flow, respectively. The largest 
liquid water saturation predicted in this study was 6.3% and was obviously 
lower than experimental data. This is because series-connected channels were 
used in the experiment and the liquid water saturation increased with the 
increasing effective channel length. The GDL was considered as hydrophilic 
structure in this study, but the GDL should be hydrophobic structure in reality. 
You and Liu [26] developed a two-dimensional, two-phase flow model in 
the cathode for PEM fuel cells, and previous study [25] didn’t include the 
catalyst layer and the membrane. Result showed that the threshold of two-phase 
flow depended on current density, operating temperature, and humidification 
temperature. Liquid water transport through the membrane depended on 
electro-osmotic drag, back diffusion, and hydraulic permeation. The liquid 
water saturation increased with increasing current density. At lower operating 
temperature, the water activity was higher and resistance in the membrane was 
lower. However, it needed larger overpotential to produce the same current 
density. Therefore, there existed an optimum operating temperature. Liquid 
water was likely to produce at lower operating temperature. The cell was easier 
to produce liquid water with increasing air humidification temperature, 
especially when the air humidification temperature exceeded operating 
temperature. And the limiting current density was lower with the increasing air 
humidification temperature. The limiting current density decreased with 
 16
low gas flow rate. When liquid water saturation was lower, the effective 
porosity would reduce as a result of liquid water generation, but the oxygen 
concentration in the GDL enhanced, this was because the reduced porosity was 
not significant to counteract the convection mechanism induced by the 
two-phase flow. Furthermore, the effect of a micro porous layer (MPL) was 
considered in porous diffusion media. The liquid water saturation was obtained 
by continuity of phase pressure, and the effect of porosity, thickness, and 
contact angle of the MPL on liquid water saturation profile was elaborated. 
During fuel cell operation, increasing humidity of the inlet stream is often 
provided in order to increase proton conductivity of membrane. However, 
when water vapor pressure exceeds saturation pressure, water vapor will 
condense into liquid water. At the presence of liquid water, the effective 
porosity of the GDL reduces and the mass transfer resistance increases, 
hindering oxygen transport to reaction site. 
    From previous studies, most of them only consider reactant gas transport 
in the GDL and neglect liquid water effect. The two-phase transport in the 
hydrophobic GDL and liquid water effect on the cell performance is scarce. 
This motivates the present study. In this study, we elaborate the liquid water 
effect on the cell performance under several physical parameters. The results of 
simulation are helpful to the design of PEM fuel cell.

2. Mathematical model 
 
2.1 Basic assumption 
The present model focuses on transport phenomena in PEM fuel cells by 
two-phase flow model. As the reaction rate at anode is higher than cathode, the 
electrochemical reaction to the cell performance is mainly limited by cathode. 
Besides, the effect of flooding often takes place in the cathode GDL. Therefore, 
the problem domain only takes cathode into consideration. The schematic of 
the model domain is shown in Fig.2.1, inclusive of the cathode channel, the 
cathode GDL, and the cathode catalyst layer.   
 20
term on the LHS of equation is the advection term. The first two terms on the 
RHS of equation is the Fickian diffusive flux within various different phases. 
The last term on RHS of equation is the diffusive flux across phases. Where 
superscript α  represents species of water or oxygen, and subscript k  
represents phase of gas or liquid. Liquid water saturation, s , represents the 
volume ratio of liquid water phase to the void space of porous media.

Where σ  is the surface tension at the liquid water and air interface. cθ  is 
contact angle. Generally speaking, GDL is Teflonized in order to be more 
hydrophobic for efficient removal of liquid water. And at different Teflon 
content, the contact angle will also change. When GDL is hydrophilic, the

is o18090 <<° cθ .

Eq. (2-34) is the governing equation of liquid water saturation, and it is a

water saturation, s, which needs one boundary condition to be solved 
numerically. 
  
2.2.3 Oxygen transport 
Since oxygen is insoluble in the liquid phase:

Eq. (2-43) is the governing equation of oxygen concentration, and it is a 
non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation which also needs one 
boundary condition. From Eq. (2-43), we can see that oxygen transport by 
advection, capillary force and diffusion. In the diffusion term, the effective 
diffusion coefficient of oxygen decreases with increasing liquid water 
saturation. And when GDL flooded with water, it will hinder oxygen transport 
to reaction site. Compared with Eq. (2-34), there is no diffusion term, this is 
because the liquid water in the gas phase is constant; hence, the gas diffusion 
term of water vanishes. 
  
 
2.3 Boundary condition 
Both Eq.(2-34) and Eq.(2-43) are non-linear-first-order ordinary differential 
equation and each needs one boundary condition. In this study, we assume the 
channel is free of liquid water under large air stoichiometry, and at the interface 
between channel and GDL, the liquid water saturation is zero.

porosity, GDL thickness, inlet velocity, and channel length were discussed as 
follows. 
 
3.1 Effect of GDL contact angle  
Fig.3-1 shows the effect of liquid water saturation in the GDL at different GDL 
contact angles. Generally speaking, the GDL is a hydrophobic material and the 
contact angle is larger than o90 . Fig.3-1 suggests that, the influence of liquid 
water saturation is significant at different contact angles of hydrophobic GDL. 
When the GDL is more hydrophobic (larger contact angle), it has higher water 
removal rate by capillary force, and the lower liquid water saturation in the 
GDL. Besides, when the GDL is less hydrophobic, the GDL may incur severe 
flooding.   
  Fig.3-2 shows the effect of oxygen concentration in the GDL at different 
GDL contact angles. In Fig.3-2, there is one single-phase flow model which 
there is no liquid water present, and the effect of liquid water on effective 
diffusion coefficient is excluded. In the two-phase flow model, even if the GDL 
has higher water removal rate ( o120 ), the effect of liquid water on oxygen 
concentration can not be neglected especially at high current density. With the 
presence of liquid water, the effective porosity of the GDL decreases and the 
mass transfer resistance increases. As the GDL is less hydrophobic, the liquid 
water is not facile to remove, and the liquid water saturation in the GDL is 
higher, the mass transfer resistance is also higher, so the oxygen concentration 
at the interface between the GDL and the catalyst layer is lower. 
Fig.3-3 demonstrates the effect of polarization curve at different GDL 
 34
variation is significant with the increasing current density. Therefore, when the 
GDL is less hydrophobic, the change in liquid water saturation profile at 
different current densities is very important. 
The effects of oxygen concentration in the GDL at different current 
densities are shown in Fig.3-5. Results indicate that, for the same contact angle 
in GDL, the higher current density leads to a lower oxygen concentration in the 
GDL. This is because the electrochemical reaction is more active with the 
increasing current density, so the consumption of the oxygen increases and the 
distribution of oxygen concentration is lower. At low current density, the 
two-phase flow model is closed to the single-phase flow model in the oxygen 
concentration profile. This is because when liquid water saturation is low, 
although liquid water renders the effective porosity of the GDL lower, the 
convection mechanism by two-phase flow improves oxygen transport. 
Therefore, liquid water effect on the oxygen concentration profile is negligent 
when current density is low. At high current density, liquid water effect on the 
oxygen concentration profile is significant. For different GDL contact angles, 
the discrepancy in the oxygen concentration profile is larger when GDL is less 
hydrophobic. To depend on above, liquid water effect on the distribution of 
oxygen concentration is significant at high current density. 
 
 
3.3 Effect of GDL porosity 
Fig.3-6 displays the effect of liquid water saturation in the GDL at different 
GDL porosities, for a local current density of 13000 A/m2. Results show that 
the liquid water saturation decreases with increasing GDL porosity, which 
means that liquid water removal rate is higher. For different GDL contact 
angles, it is seen that the liquid water saturation has a great influence at 
 36
density. For the case of different contact angles, when the GDL is less 
hydrophobic, the liquid water effect on the cell performance is higher as the 
liquid water saturation in the GDL is higher. With the decreasing porosity, the 
liquid water effect on the cell performance is higher as the liquid water is not 
facile to remove. With higher porosity, liquid water is facile to remove and the 
liquid water effect on the cell performance is slight so the performance is better. 
However, the electrode conductivity decreases with increasing GDL porosity, 
the omhic loss of the electrode will increase especially at high current density. 
The effect of omhic loss of electrode should take into consideration in the 
optimization of fuel cell performance. 
 
 
3.4 Effect of GDL thickness 
Fig.3-9 shows the effect of liquid water saturation in the GDL at different GDL 
thicknesses for a local current density of 14000 A/m2. It reveals that the liquid 
water saturation increases with increasing GDL thickness. As the mass transfer 
path increases with increasing GDL thickness, the liquid water generate at the 
catalyst layer is not facile to remove. Fig. 3-9 also indicates that the contact 
angle affects the distribution of liquid water. The liquid water saturation 
increases faster in the GDL with the lower contact angle. Besides, it is apparent 
that the discrepancy at different GDL thicknesses enlarges with the lower 
contact angle case. 
Fig.3-10 shows the effect of oxygen concentration in the GDL at different 
GDL thicknesses for a local current density of 14000 A/m2. It is seen that the

3.5 Effect of inlet velocity 
The two-phase flow in the GDL enhances oxygen transport when the oxygen 
concentration is high. However, when the oxygen concentration in the channel 
is low, the reduced diffusion by liquid water dominates over the convection, as 
proposed in previous study [28]. Since the oxygen concentration in the channel 
is affected by inlet velocity and channel length. Various inlet velocities and 
channel lengths result in different oxygen concentration in the GDL. Effect of 
inlet velocity and channel length on the cell performance is discussed as 
follows. 
    Fig.3-12 shows the effect of oxygen concentration in the GDL at different 
inlet velocities. Results show that the oxygen concentration profile is higher 
with higher inlet velocity because more fuel is supplied to the channel. For this 
reason, the depletion of fuel along the channel is slighter and the oxygen 
concentration at the interface between the channel and the GDL is also higher. 
The effect of various inlet velocities to the oxygen concentration profile is 
discussed at different current density. The consumption of oxygen increases 
with increasing current density, for this reason the distribution of oxygen 
concentration is lower. The liquid water effect on mass transfer is not 
significant for a lower current density, I = 9000 A/m2. With the increasing 
current density, the mass transfer loss takes place for inlet velocity of 0.2 m/s at 
a local current density of 16000 A/m2. With the increasing liquid water 
saturation in the GDL, liquid water effect on the oxygen concentration profile 
is more significant especially in the case of lower contact angle.

Eq.(2-48). The effect of increasing channel length is similar to decrease inlet 
velocity, and thus the effect of different channel lengths to the cell is not 
repeated here. Fig.3-14 shows the effect of oxygen concentration in the GDL at 
different channel lengths. Fig.3-15 shows the effect of polarization curve at 
different channel lengths.

decreases with lower inlet velocity and longer channel length, since 
the oxygen concentration at the interface is lower. The difference of 
GDL contact angles is remarkable, particularly at high current density, 
as more liquid water generate.  
    The following suggestions can be adopted when it comes to further study: 
1. This study focuses on the two-phase flow transport phenomena of 
cathode gas diffusion layer, and the catalyst layer is considered as an 
interface in this study. If we can extend the two-phase flow model 
into the catalyst layer or the whole system, the water management in 
the PEM fuel cells will become more completed.  
2. In the aspect of liquid water transport in the GDL, several 
correlations are based on porous media like soil, and there is a 
deficiency of experiment on water transport in the GDL. The problem 
could be improved by experimental measurement. 
3. A one-dimensional model has been developed in this study. However, 
there are some differences in real physical situation. Therefore, to 
construct the three-dimensional fuel cell model become the main 
point in the future. Furthermore, the non-uniform temperature might 
be important for fuel cell stacks, if we can take temperature variation 
into account, the water and thermal management will become more 
completed in fuel cells.
