High performance polyether ether ketone (PEEK) has become the best candidate material due 
to the unique combination properties of good thermal stability, chemical resistance and 
excellent mechanical performance. However, higher hydrophilicity is necessary to sustain 
more water electrolyte in the free volume of polymer chain to allow the ionic transport during 
electrochemical cell discharge. Several researchers have studied blendings with second 
polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) [3], polyphenyl sulfone (PPSU) [4], polyether 
sulfone (PES) [5], and polyphenlyene sulfide (PPS) [6]. In addition, it was found that 
polyaryl ether ketones under sulfonation instead of perfluorinated polymers are durable under 
fuel cell conditions over several thousand hours [7-11].  
This paper reveals a simple method to increase the hydrophilicity of PEEK by sulfonation in 
concentrated sulfuric acid at long time and high temperature. The sulfonated PEEK is 
incorporated with nano SiO2 and further treated by supercritical CO2 (scCO2). The CO2 
molecules have a plasticizing effect by Lewis acid-base interaction between the CO2 and the 
electron donor species on polymer chain. The Tg and melting temperature (Tm) can be both 
reduced [12, 13]. The ion exchange capacity (IEC) and degree of sulfonation (DS) were 
studied. In addition, the methanol permeability for PEEK SPE samples was also evaluated.  
 
2. Experimental 
The polyether ether ketone (PEEK, 450G, M.W. 34000) was received from Victrex USA. The 
sulfonation reaction was conducted by dissolving PEEK granules in 98% concentrated 
sulfuric acid (Aldrich) with the polymer/H2SO4 ratio of 5% g/mL The reaction was 
performed in a continuous mechanical stirring from 75 to 175 h and at the temperature of 
90oC. After the reaction, the marroon color sulfonated PEEK solution was then rapidly 
quenched in iced deionized water with mechanical agitation, and the white precipitate would 
appear. The sulfonated PEEK precipitate samples were repeatedly rinsed in freshly prepared 
D.I. water under ultrasonic vibration for several times, until the pH value of the washing 
water reached 6-7, and the sulfonated sample was dried at 60oC in a vacuum oven for 2 days.  
The sulfonated polymer was firstly dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrro-lidone (NMP) solvent. The 
appropriate amount of nano-SiO2 (avg. size = 10+5 nm, specific area = 640+5 m2/g) was also 
added to NMP solvent in another beaker under ultrasonic vibration. The two NMP solutions 
were then mixed under continuous mechanical agitation for 36 h. The mixture solution was 
then casted onto a glass plate at 90oC in a vacuum oven for 2 days to remove the residual 
solvent. In addition, the prepared composites could be further treated in supercritical CO2 
fluid (scCO2) by a scCO2 extraction system with a flow rate of 2mL min-1 in the reactor at 
40  and 20 MPa for 30 min℃ . The samples were then cooled to the ambient temperature to 
obtain transparent composite membranes. 
The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were measured by DSC (TA DSC 2010) with N2 gas 
  
The PEEK/SiO2 composites cannot elevate the ionic conductivity and water absorption while 
the content of SiO2 is lower than 10 wt.%. The high hydrogen bonding between SiO2 
and –SO3H groups and higher SiO2 particles would occupy the finite free volume in PEEK to 
reduce the space for water content. However, when the SiO2 content is more than 10 wt.%, 
the more SiO2 particles would loose the tight PEEK polymer chain and could sustain more 
water content, thus the ionic conductivity and water absorption was to be elevated. When the 
composite membranes were conducted in super critical CO2 fluid treatments, the interaction 
between SiO2 and sulfonic groups was destroyed and the SiO2 particles can apparently loose 
the tight PEEK polymer chain and largely increase the free volume to contain more water. 
Hence, the ionic conductivity and water absorption for the treated composite membranes 
were both improved, and were significantly elevated to 1.54×10-2 S cm-1 and 63.1%, 
respectively.  
The TGA thermographs for the sPEEK and sPEEK/SiO2 membranes were shown in Fig. 4 
and Fig. 5, respectively. The polymer exhibited one-step degradation for the membrane 
without sulfonation. The derivative scan had a peak loss at 600°C. For the highly sulfonated 
sPEEK membrane, a two-step thermal degradation process was observed. There was a weight 
loss of about 10-20% at the temperature range of 300-350°C when the degree of sulfonation 
had been increased to 68%, however, this is nearly the melting temperature of PEEK 
(Tm=350oC). For the higher nano SiO2 content in sPEEK from 1% to 20%, the weight loss at 
this temperature domain was increased to 30%. The later decomposition temperature were 
observed from the peak loss of the derivative scan at 500-600°C. Therefore, the sulfonation 
and nano SiO2 contain in sPEEK could slightly reduce the thermal degradation resistance for 
the sPEEK membrane after prolonged treatment. 
The mechanical strength and elongation properties were determined by the tensile 
stress-strain test andshown in Fig. 6 and 7. The experimental results for the sPEEK blended 
with SiO2 at room temperature. The higher the SiO2 content, the higher the tensile strength of 
10.5 MPa was found for 10wt.% SiO2 blending in the polymer membrane. The sPEEK 
membrane without SiO2 content exhibited a lower tensile strength of 6.5 MPa but with good 
elongation-at-break value of 76%. The tensile strength gradually reduced to 8.5 MPa when 
the SiO2 content higher than 10wt.%. and the elongation-at-break was also down to 28% 
when DS of the membrane was 68. This could be attributed to the interaction of hydrogen 
bonding between SiO2 and sulfonic groups but the higher SiO2 content over 10 wt.% had 
been partially destroyed the tight polymer chain. The mechanical properties were thus 
decreased with the increase in the degree of sulfonation for the sPEEK membranes. 
Fig. 8 shows the methanol permeability through the sPEEK membranes with 68% DS at 25oC 
and as a function of SiO2 content. The methanol permeability of the the sPEEK composite 
membranes were decreased as increasing the SiO2 content and compare to the Nafion 117 
membrane was calculated as 1.77×10-6 cm2 s-1 in the reference study [14]. The sPEEK owns
