2. 子計畫六成果報告英文摘要及關鍵詞 
3D electromagnetic RF and analog modeling, 3D system in packaging (SiP) and 3D integration (3D IC) 
technologies have become important design-for-manufacturability (DFM) research subjects in semiconductor 
design and manufacturing industry. The major achievements in the past three years of the PI, Keh-Jeng Chang, 
consist of: 
(a) Between 2006 and 2009, the PI worked with TSMC on “Nanometer FEOL and BEOL device extraction 
for DFM” project that includes 3D IC electromagnetic modeling using through silicon vias (TSVs). One 
US patent 7,772,868 was awarded on August 30, 2010. 
(b) In 2009 and 2010, the PI worked with an electronic company in Hsinchu Science-Based Park on designing 
and taping out an “Analog ADC SoC multimedia processor in 0.18um CMOS to perform long duration 
music and speech.” The chip has been tested as functional and successful. 
(c) In 2008, the PI worked with Etron and Synopsys on “3D RLCK modeling extraction and validation for 
accurate analog, mixed-signal, VLSI, and SoC simulations” project that generates an SiP tool called 
NAIM (i.e., NTHU advanced interconnect modeling system) and licensed the technology to Synopsys. 
 
Advanced IC packaging can act as severe loading and noise source at gigahertz-level, so it has attracted the 
research attention of many institutions where gigahertz-level VLSI and CMOS products are designed. During 
our past six-year research tasks on DFM, SiP, TFT-LCD, RLC transmission-line effects, Wafer Acceptance 
Testing (WAT) and Known-Good-Die(KGD), we have published the needs of 3D transmission-line and 
thermal models that can affect the signal integrity, power integrity, and thermal integrity of VLSI/SoC 
products. Circuit simulators such as HSPICE [8], SmartSPICE, Spectre, Eldo, and HSIM [9] have been 
widely used in nanometer VLSI product designs. Providing time-domain R,L,C,K models can enable those 
circuit-level simulations to play the same important role in gigahertz-level 3D IC product designs because 
CMOS foundries such are providing accurate time-domain FEOL transistor models for sub-65nm nodes and 
beyond. the interconnect design methodology called NTHU Advanced Interconnect Modeling (NAIM) that 
uses parallelized electromagnetic field simulations on multiple CPUs to generate R,L,C,K tables. 
With higher frequency and higher performance, transmission-line and thermal models become essential to the 
parametric yield of the electronic system designs using 3D IC. New statistic interconnect parasitic parameters 
for through silicon vias are proposed and described in details in this three-year project proposal.

system in packaging, SiP, transmission-line and thermal models, via-first, via-last, characterization circuit, 
electronic design automation, EDA tool, WAT, KGD, signal integrity.

7772868. 
 
The overall research achievements are (a) one awarded patent; (b) one submitted journal paper that is 
accepted with minor revision and is expected to appear in 2011; (c) eight international conference papers; (d) 
one licensed technology to Synopsys, Mountain View, USA; (e) the NSC project “超高畫質電視系統之設計技
術與智財研發總計畫” was recognized with second best reward in the NSOC 研究成果展 on November 21, 
2009, by NSC.  
 
With the growing importance of immersion lithography and double patterning resolution enhancement 
technologies (RET), the PI has developed lithography and OPC research work with Silvaco TCAD that can 
perform 3D TCAD and lithography simulations. The resulsts are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 4. Test patterns designed for parametric comparison for DFM [3]. 
Besides parametric yield measurements and quality assurance tasks in [1][2], there are defect-limited yield 
improvement tasks that have been essential to DFM. Several examples are Critical Area Analysis (CAA) and 
hotspot library based Lithography Process Check (LRC) [7][8]. The PI has had several meetings with the 
academic and industrial gurus. They all felt the need to speed up CAA and LRC, whose turn-around time for 
each VLSI chip should be decreased from ten to twenty hours to less than one hour. Rule based and edge 
placement error (EPE) based methods were used to efficiently screen out major random defects as well as 
lithography-unfriendly (or lithography-difficult) systematic defects. The PI observed that “design-aware” 
features should be added during defect inspections to speed up the turn-around time. 
In essence, various test structure arrays and product designs in GDS layouts were taped out and silicon 
fabrications were measured and compared with electromagnetic and lithography simulations [3][4][5]. In 
sub-65nm nodes, contacts are not only acting as parasitic resistors but also parasitic capacitors that can cause 
performance degradations signicantly, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. 
 
Figure 5. The growing importance of contact process window (Source: IBM). 
 
Examining Figures 5 and 6, our past research projects summarized that modeling the contacts is essential 
because they can have four first-order effects on the parametric effects of MOSFET transistors: (1) Idsat; (2)

Figure 8. NTHU Advacned Interconnect Modeling (NAIM) software. 
NAIM software allows IC designers to look up the tables efficiently and to execute SPICE through a graphic 
user interface (GUI). On top of Figure 8, the entries labeled as “A” group are for the thickness and material 
electrical properties of metal and inter-metal dielectrics. The data for the entries in A are process-dependent 
and are unique to each BEOL. The entries labeled as “B” group in Figure 8 are for the specification of the 
dimensions of TSVs, metal traces, and ground planes. The entries in “C” group in Figure 8 are for the 
stimulus specification during SPICE simulations. Getting around the time-consuming pitfalls of the 3D 
electromagnetic field simulation tools such as Raphael, Clever, and FastHenry [3][4][5] to come up with a 
feasible EDA methodology for gigahertz-level 3D IC designs is described to help designers achieve timing 
and signal integrity. Funding from NSC and funding and collaborations with local semiconductor companies 
have enabled us researchers to monitor misalignments using an innovative parametric testing method using 
test structure arrays and to publish 15 conference papers and to have journal papers published and accepted in 
the past five years.  
 
For successful high-frequency product designs, NAIM is being designed to use electromagnetic field 
simulations to the interconnects to achieve timing and signal integrity. NAIM is under expansion to become a 
new 3D IC EDA design methodology with accurate R,L,C,K interconnect models for SPICE simulations, as 
shown in Figures 9 and 10.

報告內容應包括下列各項： 
一、參加會議經過 
Dozens of world-wide VLSI researchers including USA, Japan, and Taiwan speakers attended 
the Ambient GCOE VLSI Workshop 2009 in Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan on September 
08, 2009. The goals are to attract research ideas on global center of excellence (GCOE) on 
ambient VLSI such as sensors and EDA software. There are total 20 speakers in two parallel 
sessions with total workshop attendees around 80.  
 
二、與會心得 
Even though there was world-wide economic recession in 2009, Waseda University has held 
more than 10 Ambient GCOE workshops without any interruption. Their 2009 workshop 
results show that many good researches such as analog, RF, EDA, and thermal VLSI 
technologies are helping the global ambient environment.  
 
三、建議 
We can see many young researchers from several Japan research institutes and many graduate 
students from Waseda University. They helped the event and listened to the speeches. They 
raised many good questions during the breaks that gave me very good impression about the 
university and the continuous investment of the Japan government on the importance of the 
global environment and VLSI trend. There is no similar workshop in Taiwan but it is needed. 
 
四、攜回資料名稱及內容 
We received: (1) the speakers’ presentation material and (2) the related past and the present 
Waseda Ambient GCOE programs and results. The four-page paper presented by by Keh-Jeng 
Chang in Waseda University is shown below. 
 
五、其他 
We also discussed the plans on two 2010 VLSI conferences in Taiwan: ASPDAC and 
SASIMI.
