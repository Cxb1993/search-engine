二、Abstract: 
We investigated the effects of pretilt angle and d/p on the stability of bistable chiral-tilted 
homeotropic nematic (BHN) liquid crystal (LC) devices by experiments and simulation.  The 
stability and experimental phenomena of BHN LC devices can be explained explicitly by 
calculating the free energies of the devices.  Among the three BHN LC device varieties, (0, 2π), 
(−π/2, 3π/2), and (π/2, 5π/2), the former two varieties are truly bistable devices in the high pretilt 
angle regime.  However, the π/2 and 5π/2 states of the (π/2, 5π/2) BHN LC device will always 
relax to the intermediate 3π/2 twisted state.  We also analyze the energy barriers between the 
two stable states of (0, 2π) and (−π/2, 3π/2) BHN LC devices.

1. Introduction 
Optically bistable liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have received increasing interest since 
Berreman and Heffner1) discovered bistable twisted nematic (BTN) LCD in 1981.  Their 
memory effect enables images to be displayed without driving voltages.  Re-addressing is only 
required upon changing the image content; therefore, bistable LCDs consume very low power.  
The major drawback of BTN LCDs is that their two states (φ and φ +2π ) are metastable with 
short lifetimes.  It is because the intermediate φ +π twist state processes a lower free energy, 
hence both the φ and φ +2π states will decay to it in a matter of time.  Berreman inferred that in 
some high pretilt angle regime and owing to splay deformation, the free energy of the φ and φ 
+2π  states will be lower than that of the intermediate φ +π state.  With suitable LC elastic 
 5
these processes are shown in Fig. 1(b). 
These results indicate that there exists a range of pretilt angle for the stable (0, 2π) BHN LC 
cells.  To investigate this range, we calculate the free energies of the three states, i.e., T, TH, and 
π states, and their correlations with pretilt angles.  Besides, d/p can affect free energy and is 
included as a parameter in the simulation.

2.2  Simulation 
We used the commercial simulator LCD Master (Shintech) and DIMOS 
(autronics-MELCHERS) to calculate the free energy to investigate the stability of various BHN 
LCDs.  The LC configuration is function of z only and the boundary directors are aligned in the 
x-axis with rigid anchoring.  The parameters of the liquid crystal material used in the simulation 
are as follows: K11 = 17.3 pN, K22 = 7.4 pN, and K33 = 30.3 pN. 
 
2.2.1 Effect of pretilt angle on free energies of two stable and intermediate states 
Since the intermediate state is a major problem in BTN LCDs and their varieties, we 
investigate the free energy of (0, 2π) BHN LCD as a function of pretilt angle and d/p ratios.  
The two stable states of (0, 2π) BHN LCD are the TH state, whose directors are nearly 
homogeneously aligned with very high tilt angles, and the T state whose directors twist 2π7.  
Since the surface anchoring is assumed to be rigid, the total free energy per unit surface area, Ftot, 
is calculated using the Frank-Oseen elastic energy density: 
[ ]∫ ×∇×++×∇⋅+⋅∇= dtot dtnnKqnnKnKF   0 2332022211 .)()()(21                   (1) 
Here, n is the unit vector director; d is the cell thickness; and K11, K22, and K33 are the splay, 
twist, and bend elastic constants, respectively.  q0 = 2π/p; p is the intrinsic chiral pitch of the 
liquid crystals.  Since the directors of the TH state are nearly homogeneously aligned, elastic 
free energy increases when d/p increases.  On the other hand, the elastic energy of the T state 
decreases as d/p increases and reaches a minimum then increases again.  Owing to the increase

We apply the same techniques to two varieties of BHN LCDs, i.e., (−π/2, 3π/2) and (π/2, 
5π/2), which operate between the −π/2 and 3π/2 twisted states and between the π/2 and 5π/2 
twisted states, respectively.  With the d/p ratios shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the free energies of 
the −π/2 twisted states (the same as that of the 3π/2 state) and intermediate π/2 twisted state of 
the (−π/2, 3π/2) BHN LC device as functions of pretilt angle are plotted in Fig 4.  Figure 4 
reveals that the intermediate π/2 twisted state has a higher free energy when the pretilt angles are 
larger than 60°.  However, using the same techniques in the (π/2, 5π/2) BHN LC device, the 
free energy of the intermediate 3π/2 twisted state is always lower than those of the π/2 and 5π/2 
states for every pretilt angle depicted in Fig. 5 with the d/p ratios shown in the inset.  This 
means that the intermediate state is the long-term final state no mater what pretilt angle the (π/2, 
5π/2) BHN LC device possesses.

3 Discussion and Conclusions 
Through the calculation of free energy, the phenomenon of bistability in the (0, 2π) BNH 
LC devices is explicitly revealed.  Mainly due to the bend deformation produced by high pretilt 
angle in the intermediate π state, the free energy of the π state is higher than those of the two 
stable states, T and TH states.  The devices are very stable when pretilt angle is in a high value 
range.  As the pretilt angle of a cell decreases, the free energy of the π state decreases faster 
than those of the two stable states and it becomes the lowest energy state among the three.  
Although we can still switch the device between the T and TH states, eventually, it will relax to 
the intermediate state.  These simulation results successfully explain the phenomena we 
observed in switching the (0, 2π) BHN LC device with varied pretilt angles. 
By analyzing the free energy of the two stable states and the intermediate π/2 state, the 
variety (−π/2, 3π/2) BHN LC device is also truly stable in the high pretilt angle regimes.  
However, we did not find a truly stable range of pretilt angle for the variety (π/2, 5π/2) BHN LC 
device using the parameters in the simulation. 
To have stable bistable LCDs, the height of the energy barrier of the two stable states must 
be as high as possible.  However, the height of the simulated energy barrier increases when the 
pretilt angle decreases; the appearance of the intermediate state limits the lowest pretilt angle.  
For the different LC materials used in BHN LCD, there exists a pretilt angle range for optimized 
stability. 
In this paper, we successfully explain the phenomena observed in the experiments through 
the simulation of the states in the (0, 2π) BHN LC device.  We also analyze two varieties, (−π/2, 
3π/2) and (π/2, 5π/2) BHN LC devices, and the results of the former variety show that it is as 
promising as the (0, 2π) BHN LC device.

二、與會心得 
 
出國參加別的國家辦的國際研討會與參加我們辦的國際研討會（如 IDMC），在心境
上還是不一樣，上台緊張多了。也因為同屬外來的客人，比較會和國際人士交流，真正像
參與國際會議。 
聆聽幾位國際資深的液晶與液晶顯示器教授的論文報告，發現除了在解決競爭激烈的
顯示器問題外，還有很多基礎的液晶與光學問題（如：Shunsuke Kobayashi 的 Compatibility 
Among Physics, Mathematical Expressions, and Conventions in the Optics of Liquid 
Crystals），尚待我們注意、發覺與研究。 
 
 
The device is switched to the biased twisted state (BT state) due to the flow effect of the DFLC when the frequency 
suddenly changed.  When the voltage is off, the directors relax to T state. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the experiments, to switch BHN LC devices from T to TH state successfully, the smaller the applied voltage the 
longer the pulse duration is needed.  For each applied pulse voltage, the zero relaxation times are achieved if the 
pulse duration is larger than a critical value.  To switch the BHN LC device from TH to T state successfully, the 
combined pulse voltages and durations also have some restrictions and some fast relaxations are observed13. 
 
2. Simulation 
To optimize the switching pulse duration and voltage, we simulated the dynamic behaviors of the directors based on 
the Ericksen–Leslie–Parodi theory14.  Table I shows the parameters used in the simulation.  Due to lack of the Leslie 
coefficients of MLC-2048, these coefficients are taken from the values of MBBA.  The time step of the simulation is 
10−5 second.  And we assumed that all the parameters but the dielectric constants of DFLC are the same at two 
frequencies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 shows the simulated transmittance of BHN LC device for switching successfully from T to TH state. When 
the pulse is long enough (the curve of pulse duration 40 ms in the diagram), the directors will keep moving to biased 
homeotropic state (BH state).  In this process, the corresponding transmittance is decreasing till almost zero in BH
