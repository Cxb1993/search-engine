Despite considerable efforts, the fabrication of protein chips using a self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) with a long chain length remains a challenge, due to its steric hindrance and the formation of
disulfides, which may generate multilayers and block the terminal carboxylate groups of the SAMs,
and thus, reduce the sensitivity of the chips. To eliminate those problems, the feasibility of using a
short-chain SAM, 4,4- Dithiodibutyric acid (4,4- DTBA, disulfide), as a monolayer for the protein
chips based on a gold surface was studied. Experiments for characterizing 4,4- DTBA were
performed by contact angle goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ellipsometry. Additionally, the fluorescent assay of 4,4- DTBA
was characterized using protein A-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate). The results of 4,4- DTBA
were compared with those of 11- MUA (11- Mercapto-undecanoic acid). The comparison results
indicate that 4,4- DTBA can be adopted as a monolayer for the protein chips.
Key words: self-assembled monolayer, 4,4- DTBA, 11- MUA, protein chip
several years [13, 14]. These studies revealed the formation of well ordered monolayer of
n-alkanethiols (CH3(CH2)xSH, x > 10) on gold. The long-chain thiol generally has a long alkyl
chain and van der Waals attractive forces among the molecules, which result in high packing
density and well ordered structures of SAMs [15-17]. However, the SAMs of pure long-chain
thiol have several problems, such as high densities of surface terminal groups leading to a steric
hindrances [18, 19] and the formation of multilayer caused by deposition of disulfides resulting
from the oxidation of thiols [20]. Additionally, the length of the aliphatic chain noticeably affects
the rates and extent of the oxidation and desorption process [21]. Moreover, the thiols of
long-chain SAMs are unstable in EtOH solution [22]. Therefore, the short-chain SAMs have
drawn attention to be a monolayer in the biochip technology [23, 24].
The activity of proteins such as immunoglobulin (IgG) immobilized on a solid surface is
typically lower than that in the aqueous phase. The main reason for the activity reduction is the
random orientation of the protein molecules on the solid substrate. A well-known protein A is
adopted as a binding material to improve and construct a well-defined antibody surface. Protein A,
a cell wall component of Staphylococcus aureus, can bind with the Fc part of the antibody.
Therefore, the use of protein A leads to highly efficient immunoreactions, and enhances detection
system performance [25-30].
Protein requires much care to maintain its three-dimensional structure and bioactivity function
owing to the unique properties of protein, particularly its sensitivity to substrate surfaces. The
fabrication of nanoscale structures with SAMs to combine protein A with solid substrates has
attracted much attention due to the interest in two-dimensional molecular assembly and its potential
applications in molecular devices, sensors and surface engineering.
In this study, the short-chain SAM, 4,4- DTBA, was investigated as an alternative monolayer
for the protein chip based on a gold surface. The results of 4,4- DTBA were compared with those
of the long-chain SAM, 11- MUA (11- Mercapto-undecanoic acid), which was mostly used. The
characterizations of the monolayers fabricated busing 4,4- DTBA and 11- MUA were examined by
contact angle, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), AFM (Atomic Force Microscope),
2.2. Formation of monolayers
The gold substrates were cleaned using a hot solution of HCl / H2O2 / distilled water (1:1:6,
v/v) for 15 min, and rinsed with distilled water. The clean substrates were immersed into silaned
OEG / tetrahydrofuran (THF) (1:10, v/v) solution for 12 h [37]. The substrates were then
immersed into 11- MUA (450561-5G, Sigma-Aldrich) and 4,4- DTBA (C15605-10G,
Sigma-Aldrich) ethanolic solution with concentrations of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mM for 24 h.
The residual self-assembled monolayers were then washed with degassed ethanol three times by an
ultrasonic cleaner, and dried in a stream of nitrogen.
2.3. Immobilization of protein A-FITC
Additionally, the treated samples were immersed into EDC (03450, Fluka, USA) / NHS (56480,
Fluka, USA), 75 mM/25 mM, which had been dissolved in a PBS buffer (pH 7.4, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g
NaHPO4, 8 g NaCl and 0.24 g KH2PO4 in 1L distilled water) for 4 h, and were again dried in a
stream of nitrogen. A drop of protein A-FITC with a concentration of 0.0167 mg/ml (P3838,
Sigma, USA) was placed on the treated substrates. The samples were then incubated at 4 for 24℃
h to immobilize protein A-FITC onto the substrates. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the two-step
reaction scheme employed to immobilize protein A on a self-assembled monolayer.
2.4. Measurement of contact angle
The contact angles of droplets on the substrate were measured by contact angle goniometry
(MigicDrop, Future Digital Scientific. Corp, USA). The relative humidity in the environment was
47%, and the temperature varied between 25 and 27 . The volume of the droplet was 5℃ μl. 
The gold substrates were initially immersed into the solutions of SAMs with a concentration of 10
mM for 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours, and then prepared by immersion into solutions of 10, 20, 40, 80 and
160 mM SAMs for 24 h. The substrates were then cleaned with ethanol and dried in a N2 stream.
Finally, the contact angles of the modified surface with the 4,4- DTBA and 11- MUA SAMs were
average of five points for each sample using a 3-phase model. Figure 3 shows a schematic of the
ellipsometric 3-phase model.
2.8. Characterization of binding capacity using protein A-FITC
Fluorescent images were characterized for studying the immobilization of protein A-FITC with
SAMs based on the ratio of fluorescent area to total area against fluorescence intensity. The
results were then normalized in accordance with the fluorescence intensity of the control sample.
The fluorescent images were using a CCD camera (Evoluting VF, Q-imaging, USA) and analyzed
using Image-Pro Plus 5.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Contact angle analysis
The activation of 4,4- DTBA and 11- MUA utilizing contact angle goniometry was observed in
this study. Figures 4 and 5 show the results of this analysis. The contact angle of the uncleaned
surface was 82.4° ± 2.1°. After washing with a hot solution of HCl / H2O2 / distilled water (1:1:6,
v/v), the contact angle was reduced to 71.8° ± 2.3°. The surfaces of the substrates became more
hydrophilic after treating the hot solution. Figure 4 shows the values of the contact angle obtained
for 4,4- DTBA and 11- MUA at a concentration of 10 mM for different immersion times.
According to Fig. 4, the gold surfaces modified by the SAM solutions became increasingly
hydrophilic as the contact angle decreased and the SAM immersion time increased. The contact
angle of the 11- MUA layer decreased to 58.1° ± 1.14° after 2 h, but that of the 4,4- DTBA
decreased slightly to 71.3° ± 0.43°. With increasing immersion time, the 11- MUA contact angles
decreased from 58.1° to 50.3°. After 24 h, the contact angle of 11- MUA was 54.4°±1.24°, and
that of 4,4- DTBA was 62.3°±0.87°. Figure 5 shows the contact angles of 4,4- DTBA and 11-
MUA. The angles were 52.5°±0.78° after the substrate was immersed into 10 mM 11- MUA for
24 h, and 57.3° ± 0.65° for 4,4- DTBA. However, the contact angles of both 4,4- DTBA and 11-
nanoscale. The surface roughnesses of the 11- MUA layer and 4,4- DTBA layer on the gold
substrate are shown in Fig. 7 measured using this approach. The surface roughness of 4,4- DTBA
was 0.7 nm at a concentration of 10 mM, and 0.5 nm at 160 mM. The surface roughness of 11-
MUA was 0.9 nm in the 10 mM solution, and 4.1 nm at a concentration of 160 mM. The
increasingly surface roughness of 11- MUA may be caused by disulfides which were oxidized from
thiols. Disulfides could precipitate onto the SAMs/Au surface resulted from the interaction
between the terminal methyl groups of the SAMs/Au [20]. The above results demonstrate that
4,4- DTBA can be a uniform layer for protein chip.
3.4. Thickness measurement using ellipsometry
The thicknesses of the 4,4- DTBA and 11- MUA layers were computed by ellipsometry.
Ellipsometry is an important tool for investigating various aspects of the structures of thin films,
such as their thickness, optical parameters and deposition kinetics. An ellipsometer was used to
measures the change in the state of polarization for reflected polarized light. In this study, the
thickness of SAMs was measured using the complex refractive index, N = n + ki, N = 1.45. For
the ellipsometric analysis, the underlying Si wafer was assumed not to affect the spectra of the
ellipsometric angle, because the gold was deposited thickly onto the Si wafer (150 nm). In this
study, the optical model consisted of gold, interface (SAM) and ambient layer (air). This
three-phase layer model adopted an interface to model the roughness of the gold surface using the
Bruggeman effective-medium approximation (EMA). When the fitting procedure was completed
with the void volume fraction and thickness of interface layer as the unknown variables, the optical
model was optimized at 38% for the void volume fraction, and the thicknesses of the 11- MUA and
the 4,4- DTBA layers were found to be 1.61 ± 0.17 nm and 0.54 ± 0.01 nm, as shown in Fig. 8.
Figure 8 shows that the thickness of 4,4- DTBA was more stable than that of 11- MUA, and did not
increase with concentration. Since the disulfide of 4,4 –DTBA is more stable than thiol in EtOH
solution, it may reduce the deposition of disulfides onto the substrate, which is formed by the
oxidization of thiols [20-22]. According to the results, 4,4- DTBA can be a suitable monolayer,
and NSC 94-2218-E-006-043. The authors also would like to thank the Center for Micro/Nano
