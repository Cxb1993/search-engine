半導體之製程愈來愈精密，積體電路中之元件密度隨之愈來愈高，伴隨而來是使 
用中之高熱現象。目前對於具有高熱之電子元件或處理器，配置散熱器已為必然之
選擇。CPU(Central-Process-Unit)，GPU(Graphics-Process-Unit)世代交替速度不
斷加快，為了維持PC(Personal-Computer)的穩定運作，散熱效能之提升也與日俱
增，因此散熱器產業在電腦零組件產業中扮演愈來愈重要的角色。 
 
二．研究目的 
   目前市面上CPU 散熱器種類繁多，但一般離不開氣冷、熱導管以及液冷三大類。
鰭片式氣冷結構雖然簡單便宜，但散熱效果跟不上微處理器飛速發展的要求。熱導
管技術由於傳熱效率高、架構緊湊等優點得到越來越多地運用。但除了熱導管本身5 
種局限以外，其安裝方向也有限制。對於需要高度散熱之場合，液冷式散熱器顯然
較符所需。由於液冷式散熱器需要有幫浦輔助冷卻液循環，而幫浦又需要有電力驅
動始能動作，但要在封閉的冷卻液流動管路中配置電力系統，其組裝成本與組裝難
度均相對較高。由於漏水以及體積的原因，目前的市售液冷系統將導熱座和散熱模
組分離，因此難以在市面上推廣。本計畫將總結上述散熱器的優缺點，試圖研發取
眾家所長補眾家所短的新一代CPU 散熱系統。 
 
三．研究方法 
首先我們利用 3D CAD 軟軆設計各組零件（圖 1），再利用 CAE 軟体進行電腦模

CAE 使用 Star CD, CAM 則使用 PowerMill。

同而不同的，因此同樣的散熱器在不同的測試裝置上，測試結果會不一樣。可是對
於不同的散熱器，在同一測試裝置上，只要仔細測試，反復驗證，還是可以得到可

Abstract 
This paper presents the development process of an internal liquid cooling system for Center Process 
Unit (CPU) or Graphics Process Unit (GPU), which can be installed inside the computer case. Commercial 
available computer aided design (CAD) software and rapid prototyping (RP) technology were used in this 
forward engineering process for the design and fabrication of the critical parts. Hereby this paper shows a 
general description of the components involved in CPU/GPU liquid cooling system. 
Then the experimental verification is presented on how the device was tested.  The adequate working 
conditions obtained as well as the system performance trends are shown graphically.

Introduction 
With the increasingly tendency of higher density microprocessors and new software requirements for 
example; Basic Microsoft’s Vista requires at least 800MHz processor, 512 MB storage and a video card 
supporting DirectX 9. For upgraded Vista, 1GHz processor, 1GB storage and 128MB video card is needed. 
Heat dissipation has become more of an issue since current microprocessors are reaching a point where 
they can no longer be cooled by traditional air cooling systems. Another factor adding more complexity to 
the cooling process is that new dual core chips have a greater non uniform heat distribution, two “hot spots” 
will require a different cooling approach.  
Current microprocessors consume up to more than 100 W/cm2, and the heat generation of the CPUs also 
follows Moore’s Law. With the amount of transistors doubling-up every 18 months so does in very similar 
pattern heat generation.  
Common CPU failure mechanisms tend to be mechanical (solder bump bridging, die fracture, corrosion) 
and electrical (overstress, migration and diffusion, gate oxide breakdown). Following the Arrhenius 
equation, (for die temperatures operating in the range of -20ºC to 140ºC) every 10ºC decrease in 
temperature reduces the failure rate by approximately a factor of 2. Therefore a reduction in chip failure 
rates with lower operating temperatures can be expected. 
Liquid cooling can be directed to the exact place where the heat is being generated. This is something that 
can only be achieved with this technique. The liquid cooling system requires an active mechanism to move 
the fluid from the liquid block, where it absorbs the heat generated by the CPU/GPU, into the radiator 
where the heat is transferred trough air cooled fins into the ambient. 
Liquid cooling is currently one of the best and most immediate options for non uniform heat sources of 
high performance CPU/GPU. One of the main drawbacks of this alternative is that many customers may 
not be very enthusiastic to install a device that could some how leak into their computers. This project 
intends to develop a new generation liquid cooling system that is leakage-free.  
This paper presents the development of a liquid cooling system that can be installed in the interior of the 
computer case, following the concepts of forward engineering and using RP Technology to generate parts 
for the device being developed.  
 
Basic Design 
 
A CPU/GPU liquid cooling system has three basic components; a liquid block, a liquid pump and a 
radiator. These three closed linked components will extract the heat generated by the microprocessor and 
transfer it out of the computer system into the ambient.

k copper box, with 1mm x 1mm x 0.5mm grids machined onto the inside bottom surface to increase the 
liquid-solid interface area. The 80mm x 80mm x 40mm radiator has 40 fins and the 8mm diameter bronze 
tubing. All these components were connected in close loop with flexible plastic hosepipes for the 
convenient observation. During the trials, 80mm x 80mm fans from JetArt and Vantec were tested 
separately. In the development, two different pump types were tested, the first one was an axial pump 
(concentric shafts with sloped leaves) and an eccentric pump (eccentric shaft arrangement in the chamber). 
The later type design gave better results for the desired performance. Since liquid will cause corrosion in 
the system, motorcycle coolant was used in the experiment. For fixing the cooling unit onto the heat source, 
spring steel pressure clamp was used.

In order to find th
s were conducted. The system was mounted on a heat source that provided 57.2 Watts using a 
commercially available thermal heat-sink grease and pressure clamp. 
Due to the scale of the Amp-meter used in the laboratory, the Amp
Local voltage is about 110 V, therefore, the supply power in the experiments was 57.2 Watts.  
The room temperature fluctuates day and night about ± 2 ºC. Therefore ∆T = TCPU-Troom is pre
 paper, where TCPU is the temperature measured in the interface between the heat source and the liquid 
block.

flow rate instead of pump RPM is presented here, because this is a Single-Motor-System. That is to say, the 
liquid pump leaf is driven by the fan motor. The variation of the liquid flow rate was achieved by changing 
the pump design under the same shaft RPM. The temperature lectures after the system stabilized at one 
temperature produced the following curve.

Conclusions & Overlook 
The RP technology continues to be a great tool for engineers, during the development of this system 10 
different leave designs and 8 pump cases were tested; all of these were fabricated by using the RP 
technology. Without RR capabilities it would be very difficult, if not at all impossible, to test all these 
different designs, taking into count the timing and the budget. 
Internal liquid cooling for CPU is doable, but must overcome actual design limitations for the internal 
installation sake. In an internal liquid cooling system for CPU or GPU, it is important to notice that not 
only the flow rate generated by the pump but also the cooling capabilities of the radiator used. It is clear 
from the experimental data presented that fan speeds above 1000 RPM are required for minimum operation. 
A harmonic combination of these two factors will lead to the greater cooling; otherwise the system will just 
move the heated liquid around. 
To get better results and closer to commercialization, more or all metal parts will be used after the 
optimization with the RP technology in future study. Moreover, research from this project will expand to 
the optimization of a liquidblock that can work better with the internal pump system presented as well as 
the efficiency of the radiator section.

This paper presents the study of different water-block designs to best fit the internal liquid pump, using commercial 
available CFD software (STAR-CD), targeting the understanding of the flow maldistribution and its effects on the 
heat performance of the water-block. A serious of different flow paths are presented as well as different inlet-outlet 
locations.

Assumptions and Simulation Method 
The study of flow field and heat transfer was performed using commercially available CFD software, STAR-CD. The 
governing equations were solved using PRO-STAR which uses the finite volume method. 
There are 12 different cases (3 major designs) analyzed in this paper, each case was simulated for different operating 
conditions such as, inlet geometry and flow rate, liquid path and input heat. 
The heat source is located on the opposite side of the inlet and outlet of the water-block, which can be referred as the 
“back side” of the devise, the remaining walls are considered to be adiabatic. 
The CAE simulation parameters are based on our newly developed internal liquid cooling system shown in Fig. 1 
through Fig. 3. The size of the water-block is 50x50mm and the wall thickness connected to the heat source is 2 mm. 
The heat source generates at a constant power of 50 W or 100 W. The thickness of the channels inside the water-block 
varies from 1mm or 7mm according to the design. 
Four different inside structures are presented, the first is a hollow block with no internal configurations to force the 
flow. The second is a hollow box with small grids evenly distributed on the bottom as shown in Fig. 2. The third is a 
labyrinth style design, with the inlet on one end of the water-block and the outlet on the opposite side (labyrinth I) as 
shown in Fig. 3. To reduce pressure drop, a labyrinth with double passage (labyrinth II) was created. For labyrinth 
design I the cooling channels have a 4 mm width, and 8 mm height. For design II the passage has two cooling channels 
of 7 mm wide. For the hollow block design the inlet is located on one corner of the water-block and the outlet is placed 
on the opposite corner, letting the fluid flow freely inside the water-block.

pressure drop and the maximum liquid speed are almost the same, no mater how the heat source varies. This is 
because of the assumptions of incompressible flow and constant liquid properties under different temperature. This 
confirms the results of the simulation. 
The advantage of the grids design is very obvious from the CAE analysis, because with moderate increase of 
pressure-drop, the temperature reduced quite significantly.  
Labyrinth I design, leads to the lowest temperature. However, the pressure-drop increased dramatically to 6204 Pa, 
compared with 462 Pa from hollow block design. To compensate this drawback, labyrinth II design which has two 
parallel paths was considered. Through the labyrinth II design, a happy medium seems to be found.

It is suggested from the results showing in Table 1, 2 and 3, that the combination of the double labyrinth and the grid 
pattern is an effective way to increase the heat transfer and maintain low CPU temperature. The following section is 
going to outline the parametric study of the combination which leads to the optimization of the water –block design. 
Parametric Study of Major Dimension  
The designs containing labyrinth and grids demonstrate the best thermal performance; however the labyrinth presents 
a higher pressure drop which is unwanted since it demands more on the liquid pump. 
The starting point for the optimization is to reduce pressure drop without sacrificing too much thermal performance. 
The double labyrinth was first redesigned by reducing the back-flow zones, especially in the middle area. This 
optimization was achieved by tuning the length of the individual ribs inside the water-block. Results are presented in 
figure 9, where D1 through D4 are different configurations of the inside structure. The evaluation parameters to 
determine the effectiveness of the changes are ∆-Temperature and ∆- Pressure.

It is obvious to us that D4 is the best candidate for the next step of the optimization, since it has a relative low 
pressure drop while maintaining an acceptable ∆-Temperature. 
The next step is to introduce a grid pattern with different heights in the optimized flow double labyrinth design (Fig. 
10).

risk of premature failures on the CPU. 
Regarding the grid height, the higher the grids, the lower the temperature; however the height effect on the pressure 
drop is not as severe. Therefore it is suggested that as long as manufacturing process allows, highest possible grids 
should be adopted  
Finally from this CAE analysis, each water-block design should have its optimum height above which there would 
not be a major performance contribution that justifies the extra space and material used.
