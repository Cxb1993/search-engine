2摘要
全球人口增加，都市化程度愈形顯著，都會區因此環境品質每下愈況，在此之時，
公園在改善都會區之生活品質與微氣候扮演重要的角色，亦是野生動物之都市棲息
地，可將自然生態引入都市營造優質都市生態系統。本研究在探討公園改善都市環
境品質上，利用大量問卷調查探討在公園內活動居民住所至公園之平均距離，分析
台北市與金門縣各類公園之服務範圍與可及距離，同時比較城鄉居民使用公園特性
之差異，。
由本計畫研究有關台北市與金門縣公園使用民眾住所至公園之平均距離可發現，台
北市使用小型公園之民眾住所多位於公園400公尺之範圍內，大型公園之民眾住所則
多位於4,000公尺內，而金門縣使用公園之民眾住所多位於公園12000公尺範圍內。
而公園使用者年齡層分布方面，台北市小型公園使用者年齡多數介於40~79歲間
(81%)，金門之公園使用民眾年齡層分布相頗為均勻。另一方面，台北市小型公園與
金門縣公園使用者之性別比例相近，皆為男性約為女性之二倍，但台北市大型公園
則民明顯不同而呈現女多於男之現象，都市民眾以步行與自行車為主(近80%)，而相
對的，金門僅67%，金門居民則因生活交通習性，使用機車或汽車前往公園之比例
相對偏高。鄉間離島與都會區公園之可及距離差異相當明顯，居民使用公園之態度
亦不同，因此在規劃鄉間公園時不可直接引用都市公園標準，應另行研究以符合地
區特性。
關鍵詞: 都市公園，可及距離，性別比例，交通工具，金門
4壹、前言
根據聯合國人口基金組織(United Nations Population Fund, UNFDA)統計，當前
全球人口已超過67億，其中50%約(3.3億)居住於都市中，此人口集中之現象日益顯
著，推估在2030年將有80%之人口居住於都市中，然而都會區人口擁擠、交通繁忙、
空氣污染等皆不利於都市之發展與其環境品質之維持。同時全球氣候變遷與暖化，
隨伴著能源之耗用及都市建築與舖面之水泥化，都市之熱島效應也益形嚴重，種種
人口集中於都市之效應對都市之運作產生不良的影響，亦造成居民生活品質之降
低。有鑑於都市環境之惡化，都區之綠地、公園與綠廊更形重要，公園綠地不僅提
供民眾活動休憩之場所，同時亦可降低局部地區之熱島效應，改善空氣品質，美化
景觀，是不可或缺之都市元素。
台灣大都會區大約每提昇10﹪的綠覆率，對周圍平均氣溫有降低0.13~0.28℃的
效果(林憲德，2005)，綠地系統的規模大小，直接影響綠地對於都市氣溫環境的改
善效果，在台灣四大都會區之熱島分佈中可發現，都市中規模夠大的綠帶、植樹園
道、公園等綠地系統對於都市氣溫環境的改善，提供了莫大的助益與效果，然而綠
地之效用不僅呈現於環境層面，在都市生態系統中亦具有關鍵之區位，都會區內地
下水之補注、土壤之保育及野生動物之引入皆有賴良好規劃管理之綠地公園，尤其
親近野生動物為都市居民所最嚮往最缺乏者，若公園之植被得以吸引島類或小型哺
乳動物之駐留，則都市之生態品質將可大幅提昇，人與自然將不致於如此遥遠，生
態都市將可逐步建構。台中市景賢生態公園的研究歸納雖生態公園之蝶相不若鄰近
都市化程度較低地區之蝶相豐富，惟亦顯示在高度開發的都市環境仍具有營造蝶類
棲地之潛力(李大維，2007)，因此都市公園仍具備動物棲地之功能。
公園綠地不僅可營造生物棲地，亦可吸引都市民眾停留、休閑或活動，同時也
是都市內極重要之地景區塊(Patch)，對於居住在水泥叢林中之都會居民是不可或缺
之元素。一般而言，大型公園可吸引較大區域範圍內之居民經常性造訪活動，有時
甚至外地民眾亦不定期前來，而小型鄰里公園則多僅能作為緊鄰公園之住民休憩之
用，其影響範圍十分侷限，若能了解經常性使用公園之居民住所位置，並量測住所
6兒童遊樂場

平均300，最大400
平均600，最大800
鄰里公園 ≒20000 800
鄰里公園 <10000 800
由以上資料顯示，公園規模與服務半徑差異相當大，其中服務半徑為居民住所
至公園中心之距離，此定義與可及距離有所出入，對小型公園而言誤差不大，但中
型或大型公園則有待商榷，服務區應該以居民住所至公園邊界之距離為其範圍方是
合理，本研究探討有關台北市與金門縣公園使用民眾住所至公園之平均距離並比較
城鄉居民使用公園特性之差異。
貳、研究目的
公園與人的關係為重要課題，針對都市居民而言公園何種特性可吸引較大範圍
住民之使用，其住民對公園之親近度亦是公園綠地規劃之重點，此問題尚未有相關
研究，十分值得加以探討。本計畫之研究目的在實際探討城鄉居民使用公園之各項
特性與公園可及距離，透過問卷調查歸納居民使用公園的態度，男女比例，交通工
具等特性，以反映城鄉環境之差異與居民習性對公園形態之喜好程度，期望成果可
塑造正確知公園規劃思維。
參、研究方法
台北市都市計畫法規中將公園定義為：政府為促進都市美觀、國民健康、兼具
防洪、避難、防災等功效而負責設計規劃、投資、與開闢的綠化園地(黃淑姿，1982)。
台北市列管之公園共187 處，其中有小型鄰里公園、自然公園、綜合公園及河濱公
園等(台北市公園路燈工程管理處，2007)。市民公園親近度調查本項調查在了解不
同公園特性吸引臨近地區市民進入之距離，預期小型鄰里公園僅能吸引緊鄰公園旁
住民休憩，大型公園則可吸引更遠距之市民使用，唯其平均距離為何則有待探討。
本計畫將於各公園不同時段進行問卷調查，若公園之規畫在照顧廣泛市民，各類公
園之親近距離將是重要之決定因素之一，由此親近距離可決定都市公園之涵蓋度，
8表3 本研究問卷調查表
調查分上午7:00–9:00與下午17:00–19:00兩時段，其中台北市各小型公園皆僅
調查一次，青年公園與大安森林公園因面積較大，故調查二次，分析時亦將二公園
獨立處理，訪談目標主要為在公園活動之民眾，並要求受訪民眾於地圖上指出住所
位置，所獲資料帶回研究室利用地理資訊系統(Geographic Information System, GIS)
量測受訪民眾住所至公園邊界之最近距離，使用者住所至公園之平均距離為最近距
離之平均值，而最遠距離則為該公園受訪民眾中住所至公園邊界之最遠者。由平均
距離與最遠距離之統計資料探討公園可及度(或親近度)，以作為公園規劃時之基本
參考依據。

二、交通工具
有關前往公園使用之交通工具，經統計有以下各圖說之結果
圖8 金門縣居民前往公園使用之交通工具(數量，百分比)
14
民眾以步行與自行車為主(近80%)，而相對的，金門僅67%，二者之差異可能是在使
用公園之態度與目的，台北市居民至公園活動以休閒及運動為主，交通工具之選擇
亦以相同之態度，步行與自行車最能達到休閒及運動之目的，而金門縣居民則以”
前往景點”為主要之目的，且調查之金門縣大型公園鄰近地區住家較少，公園與民眾
住所距離較遠，因此使用較快捷之交通工具，離島鄉間不似都會區之環境形態，生
活習慣上多以機車代步，較不利於步行或自行車之使用。
三、性別分布
台北市居民前往大安森林公園與青年公園等大型公園、小型公園與金門縣居民
前往各類公園使用之性別分布情形如下表
表4 公園規模使用者性別分布
男 女
台北市大型公園 38.9% 61.1%
台北市小型公園 63.3% 36.7%
金門縣公園 65.3% 34.7%
由表4可清楚發現台北市小型公園與金門縣公園使用者之性別比例相近，皆為男
性約為女性之二倍，但台北市大型公園則民明顯不同而呈現女多於男之現象，且差
距甚大，是否某些大型公園特質足以吸引更多之女性民眾，未來可加以進一步研究
或進行交叉分析。
四、年齡層分布
本研究嘗試建立性別對公園之偏好情形問卷調查時亦顯示公園使用者之性別，
其結果如以下各圖說。
16
受訪居民年齡
圖13 金門縣居民前往各類公園之年齡分布情形
台北市與金門縣內各小型公園人數並不多，基本上多數民眾皆已受訪，而大型
公園因人數較多，調查之基本原則為隨機抽選，因此受訪民眾之年齡層分布應以具
備代表性，台北市小型公園使用者年齡多數介於40~79歲間(81%)，此反映上下午該
時段多數為鄰近較高齡之居民使用，都市生活緊湊，年輕人多位工作忙碌，上午
7:00~9:00與下午17:00~19:00皆為通勤時間，年輕人公園使用率低，而大安森林公園
與青年公園等大型公園雖規模較大，功能多樣，可滿足各族群需求，亦較有名氣，
但在該二時段並未能吸引年輕族群活動，因此年齡層分布與小型公園相似。另一方
面，因由人口結構因素，原預期金門之公園使用民眾應屬較高齡者，但調查結果卻
發現金門之公園使用民眾年齡層分布相頗為均勻，據推測可能因金門之公園規模皆
較台北市大，公園不僅作為鄰近居民之休閒空間，同時亦成為小型之觀光景點，可
吸引不同年齡層之民眾前往，反映了鄉間島嶼之公園使用特性。

1A Report of Attending International Conference of Ecology and Transportation
Shyh-Chyang Lin
National Kinmen Institute of Technology
Before attending the ICOET conference, I visited Dr. Tony Clevenger at Canada's Banff
National Park and his animal crossing facilities. Tony took me and my co-attendees,
Weling and Yu-Huei, to different crossing facilities. There are mainly three kinds of
crossing structures, overpass, underpass, and culvert. The decision of the location of
passages is mainly based on 4 field survey data: (1) road kill data, (2) animal footprint
tracking, (3) radio tracking, (4) computer simulation and GIS data. For those where field
data is limited, Dr. Clevenger suggests that computer simulation co-op with experts'
opinions can be very helpful in deciding the suitable locations to construction passages
since there is little difference with the results of computer simulation/expert system from
that of 4 field survey data. The overpasses are used for most bears especially for the
endangered Grizzly Bears. From the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH), we easily spot the
overpasses as below.
Animal overpasses above TCH
It is hardly to know we were on the overpass (as shown below) where the vegetation was
intensified to make the local landscape naturally.

Size of the culvert. Dr. Clevenger and the camera
I personally also checked an underpass as I traveled to Banff. The underpass is installed
under TCH but is high above adjacent ground. As I climbed up to the underpass, I could
see the dimension of the underpass that is virtually a bridge with intensified vegetation. I
did not spot a camera but from the sign for the structure, camera is fixed somewhere that
is aimed to the center of the underpass to record animal crossing.

Climbing the fence Discussion
International Conference of Ecology and Transportation 2009 (ICOET 2009) was held in
9/13 to 9/17 in Duluth, Minnesota. This is the fifth biennial ICOET bringing together
world experts to share the most current knowledge and practices at the intersection of
transportation and the ecological sciences. "Adapting to Change" is 2009 conference
theme, and it reflects the times. The environmental challenges that come with addressing
transportation needs seem more urgent and more complex, requiring innovation and
adaptation.
The conference is very friendly to Taiwan such that the Taiwan's national flag was shown
in the hall. Three of us took terms to take picture with our flag.
7My presentation
After the presentation, I have attended 14 technical presentations. Some topics are of
interesting but some are more like short reports. However, we can see that everyone is
doing his/her best to make this world more ecological friendly. Some outlines of the
presentations are recorded as following.
Session 211-1: In Utah, the fresh water coming from mountain providing different
habitats adjacent to Salt lake therefore increases its biodiversity. Lake is always in
dynamically changing as water drying, the lake provides food for avian.
Session 213-4: GIS and road kill data has been used for analysis and planning, especially
the animal habitat (Big horn sheep) must be shown to decide the location for mitigation.
9Ungulates: 27813
Focal species: 1,249
Focal carnivores: 166
Applying GIS overlay road kill concentration areas with wild life linkage data and
standardized inter-agency data collection/report is powerful in road kill mitigation.
There is also poster session in the conference. Professor Berry presents the assessment of
fragmentation of China natural areas by applying GIS. It shows the how powerful GIS is.
A French participant use chick bodies to measure road kill survey bias. The idea is
interesting and results may be applied to Taiwan's road kill survey. Weiling and
Yun-Huei's poster presented the effect of sound barriers in lowering bird-vehicle collision.
The result is inconclusive. High barriers may keep birds fly high over a highway but may
also attract birds stop at barriers and eventually fly to the road and got hit. More study
may be needed to assess the effect of sound barriers.
One of important things of participating an international conference is to meet people. We
met our old friend Professor Alison Berry of University of California at Davis. Alison had
been in Taiwan 2 years ago. She is a good friend of Taiwan and is a important scientist
with influence in road ecology. We were very happy to din with Professor Berry and Dr.
Tony Clevenger. We also talk to chairman of the conference Mr. Wagner about possibility
of moving the conference to Taiwan. But because of funding from USDOT Federal
Highway Administration, it will be difficult to hold the conference outside of the US.
However, there is still a similar conference that will be held in Europe in 2010 that we
may be able to attend.

Ecological Effects of Road Construction on Regional Ecosystem

Abstract
The impact of road networks on regional ecosystems is often overlooked by
transportation planners and civil engineers. Due to a lack of scientific data, the ecological
impact a road has on adjacent areas is the topic of debate between conservationists and
engineers in developing countries. The extent of ecological impact varies depending upon
species and is not sufficiently studied for some endemic species. Most research about
ecological impact zones examines existing roads with adjacent ecosystems in a stable
condition. Few studies have been carried out for roads under construction where dynamic
and intense disturbances from construction may attract or repel animals from nearby
natural areas. Those short term impacts may cause instant local extinction for some
sensitive species and change local biodiversity. This study, performed on Kinmen Island,
Taiwan, investigates the ecological impact of road construction. The species studied are
mainly rodents, invertebrates, and amphibians. It was found that the Brown Country Rat’s 
(Rattus losea) edge habitat is broader next to farmland (35m) than it is next to the road
(15m). The disturbance of construction also reduces the edge habitat area. Since the
Ornate Rice Frog (Microhyla ornate) typically resides and forages in dim and humid
environments, they instinctually avoid edges. The dry environment and brightness of the
road side prevent them from entering the edge area. Most invertebrates captured were
found at an edge depth of 15m along the road side and 35m along the farmland. Our data
suggests that road construction can decrease the edge habitat area within woodlands more
so than farmlands, but the creation of new edges by a road can provide more edge
habitats for edge species and, therefore, may lead to an imbalance within the ecosystem.
Edge depth and ecological impact data found in this study can be applied to planning,

Scope of investigation
On Kinmen Island, Taiwan - where the highway system is not elevated - vegetation
rehabilitation during the Chinese Civil War (1950~1990) created an ideal habitat for
various species, especially migratory birds. Over the last 15 years construction and
development on Kinmen has caused the destruction of vegetation and woodland areas.
The subject of our study will be Wuan Dau West Road (WDW), which is currently under
construction (Figure 1). Construction commenced on June 27, 2006. The road is 337m
long and 15m wide, including a pedestrian walkway on one side. The road bisects a 9.97
hectare area of woodland into two sections (Figure 2). The eastern section of the
woodland is 4.04 hectares, and, the western section is 5.01 hectares. The ecological effect
research was conducted in the western section. The woodland canopy is mostly covered
by Beef woods (Casuarina equisetfolia) with dispersed Acacia confuse and Eucalyptus
robusta. Under the canopy there are Melisa azedarach, Litsea glutinosa, Albizzia lebbeck,
Celtis sinensis, a few Pinus massoniana, Cinnamomum camphora, Sapium sebiferum,
Vitex negundo, and Dodoneae viscose. The understory species are mainly Lantana
camara, and Murraya paniculata, with dispersed Asparagus cochinchinensis, Berchemia
lineate, Elaeagnus oldhamii, Maytenus diversifolia, Pteris semipinnata, Lygodium
japonicum, Cocculus orbiculatus, and Commelina auriculta. Of the total 107 species, 72
are native, 1 endemic, 1 endangered, and 3 rare. The western woodland was selected for
study due to its large area in comparison to the eastern woodland. The eastern side of the
section is under construction, the southern side is WDW road, and the west and northeast
sides are farmland. The woodland is an ideal site to evaluate the effects roads and
farmlands have on edge habitats. The survey was designed to measure the distance from
the road to the spots where animals (target species being rodents, invertebrates, and
amphibians) are captured or trapped. The subsequent results allowed us to evaluate the
ecological effects road networks have on the regional ecosystem.

route one wire-mesh trap and pitfall were placed at 10m intervals from the roadside into
the core of the woodland. The research commenced on July 1, 2006 and concluded on
January 7, 2007. It was conducted 16 times. Three days were needed for each survey and
animals were given a two week recovery period. On the evening of the first day, bait was
put into the wire-mesh traps and pitfalls were filled with fresh water. The next morning
(around 7 AM), researchers checked for captured animals. The small mammals (mostly
rodents) were marked with paint and then released. A large number of invertebrates
trapped in the pitfalls died. They were marked and brought back to the laboratory for
identification. After bringing back the captured animals, the wire-mesh traps were
washed thoroughly to prevent unnecessary odours. On the evening of the same day, the
traps were refilled with bait and the pitfalls were filled. The same procedures were
performed on the morning of the third day. During the period of investigation, two routes
(I and J) were greatly altered and shortened by construction and then abandoned. Since
only a few routes were slightly altered, the research was carried out with little change.

Results and Analysis
Construction was scheduled to be completed in 210 days. However, due to design
changes, the project had not yet been finished at the completion of this paper. Since some
survey routes E, F, G were destroyed by construction, the survey in those areas had to be
stopped. During the construction period, the most common mammals captured were the
Brown country rat (Rattus losea), the House shrew (Suncus murinus) and the Red-bellied
tree squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus). Pitfalls collected a great number of invertebrates,
spiders, and amphibians. Nine birds were also, unexpectedly, attracted by the bait in the
wire-mesh traps and captured during the investigation. The results are listed in Table 2.

Ecological edge effects of road construction on Brown country rat distribution
In Kinmen, the Brown country rat is the dominant small mammal in the field and it
was captured with great frequency during our research. In calculating the collected data
(shown in the Figure 4), we found a considerably higher rate of capture (the average
number of capture per night) for rodents near the road and farmland edge as opposed to
the inner area of the woodland. In this case, the resources and microclimate of the edge
encourage the rodents to forage, where they are captured, by the wire-mesh traps. We,
therefore, characterize Brown country rats as an edge species. However, the locations
closest to the road (0m) have a lower frequency than the second closest locations (10m).
This indicates that the constant and intense disturbance of road construction prevents the
rodents from getting too close to the job site. To evaluate the depth of the ecological edge
along the road (d), correlation analysis and p-value were calculated by taking d =5m, 15m,
25m with a 95% accuracy. Since route I and J are too short and route E falls into the edge
area at the other end of the woodland, they are excluded from the following statistical
analysis. The lengths of other routes are between 70m and 100m. Table 3 shows results
of point-biserial correlation analysis for the edge along the road. A value (d) with the
highest correlation coefficient (r) and lowest p-value is the most accurate representation
21
change of landscape (i.e. farmland/woodland) provides better habitat quality for the
rodents. Although the Brown country rat is a generalist, the disturbance of road
construction can reduce the depth of edge habitat for the species. Our depth edge
numbers for the Brown country rat differ from those for small mammals (120~200m)
found by other researchers (Stevens and Husband, 1998; Laurance, 1994). This is due to
the fact that edge size is highly dependent upon landscape, vegetation, geology, road
condition, and species; survey site vegetation cover and species characteristics of the
small mammals studied in this research are distinct from the other two.

Ecological Edge Effects of Road Construction on Invertebrates
Invertebrates are a primary species in a trophic system which is dependent on them
for supplementary nutrients. Although an elementary species, they are important and
abundant members in an ecosystem. Due to their low tolerance of interferences, the
population size and species of invertebrates are ideal indicators in evaluating the impacts
23
Similarly, we can analyze the effects of the farmland edge on the distribution of
invertebrates by setting the irregular woodland/farmland boundary as an edge. The results
of invertebrates captured are shown in Figure 7. The results of correlation analysis were
obtained and are shown in Table 6. With the highest correlation coefficient r=0.294 and
the lowest p-value p=0.041, the depth of the ecological edge along the woodland adjacent
to farmland is d=35m and is statisticaly sound. This is due to the woodland invertebrates’ 
attraction to the microclimate and light or resources in the area near the farmland edge.
Here, the gradient of ecological variation is much lower than road/woodland edges.
Therefore, captivity of invertebrates is higher along the woodland/farmland edge.
Another explanation for this result is that invertebrates prefer the farmland habitat over
the woodland. This phenomenon merits further study to clarify invertebrates' habitat
preferences.

relatively low and randomly dispersed. Based upon their ecological features, we conclude
that the Spectacled toad is a generalist which migrates or forages over developed and
natural areas. Road construction may have minor ecological impacts on this species.
Road Network Ecological Impact Analysis
Assuming that the road network in a region is a square grid, as shown in Figure 8
(Lin, 2006), the road density can be obtained as
LL
L 22
2  , (1)
where, L denotes the length of road in either direction within the unit area (Figure 9). The
ratio of edge area to total area of the region (γ, including roads themselves) can then be 
obtained by calculating the ratio within the unit area as

where, R denotes road width and d is the depth of edge. Equation (2) represents the
relationship between road density and edge area ratio, γ, in the regional landscape. The 
relationship between road width, the ratio of edge area and road density can then be
obtained (refer to Figure 9) as: R=15m and d=15m, 25m, 35m respectively. From the
results of this research, the edge depth for Brown country rats and invertebrates is about
15m. Once the road has been widened, the edge area ratio in the region will increase and
the population of edge species will augment. Therefore, in a fragile island ecosystem like
Kinmen, the balance of the regional ecosystem is in jeopardy. Some interior species, such
as rice frogs, avoid roads and road edges and retreat to fragmented and diminishing inner
habitats with limited resources and a small habitat area. This will cause the reduction of
their population and, more seriously, high road density could cause local extinction for
sensitive interior species.

If we take road width R=20m of a normal secondary road and refer the distance of edge
effects on various species in Table 1, we can assess the ecological impact of road density
on a species at the regional scale.
Discussion
A special ecological edge habitat is created on either side of the road as construction
commences. The disturbances of construction and the changes of microclimate instantly
afect terestrial animals’ behaviors by atracting or expelling them. Non-native plants
then gradually invade the natural area, starting from the edge, further altering the
distribution of animals by the change of vegetation. Finally, a stable strip-like
micro-ecosystem along the edges is established as road construction is completed. For
edge species (rodents and invertebrates in this research), edges provide favorable habitats
and lead to higher interior population density. For interior species (rice frog), the adverse
edge environment forces them to retreat into the inner portion of the woodland. As
regional development progresses, most interior species are prone to become threatened or
locally endangered, and are in need of conservation. As discussed earlier, the edge depth
varies depending on the species. A broad edge area can increase the number of edge
29
the methods used in development and construction in order to conserve the species that
need protection. Quality of habitat (resource and environment) and configuration of
habitat (structure and arrangement) are two major factors affecting population and spatial
distribution of insects (Grundel and Pavlovic, 2007). This argument is also true for most
terrestrial species. Roads change the ecological quality and configuration of the habitat
edge. They alter the population and distribution of terrestrial and avian species and
corresponding mitigation measures should be implemented at each phase of road
engineering. At the road planning stage, connectivity of habitats or natural areas must be
the leading priority. Alternative road alignment to avoid natural habitat should be
seriously considered. Building animal passages is an important mitigation measure.
Regional critical road density derived in this research is a useful indicator to evaluate
road planning and allow focal species enough area to thrive. Road construction
immensely impacts regional ecosystems. Only congregational development, ecologically
friendly design and construction can achieve conservation and transportation convenience
at the same time and, thus, meet the needs of both human beings and nature.
