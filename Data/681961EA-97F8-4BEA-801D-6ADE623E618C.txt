Abstract—We report on the development and system 
integration of a human-size biped robot. On the hardware side, 
several topics are addressed, including active joint assignment, 
mechanism design, mechanical arrangement, mechatronic 
system layout, system integration, etc. On the software side, two 
topics are included: (1) walking/turning gait development based 
on the inverted pendulum model, and (2) dynamical simulation 
within ADMAS/Matlab environment to preview the 
performance of the designed gaits. After that, the empirical 
robot experiments are carried out. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Humanoid robotics is one of the robotic fields which draw 
audience’s great attention in recent years [1-5]. Research of 
the humanoid robot have various aspects; for example, 
human-robot interaction, actroid, etc. In this paper we would 
like to focus on the “motion” side; more specifically, design 
bipedal legs which is capable of performing biped locomotion. 
The most challenge task in developing a humanoid robot is to 
generate a stable gait, so lots of research on gait analysis or 
other related topics [6-9]. The method of producing a 
human-like gait for biped robots has been proposed [10]. 
Some control methods for biped robot with stable walking 
gaits have been reported as well [11-13]. 
Before applying  new designed gaits or control methods to 
a biped robot for performance evaluation, simulations are 
usually carried out first to ensure the stability of the designed 
gait. Thus, preventing a possible damage of the expensive and 
complicate physical robot, which is composed of lots of 
sensors, actuators, mechanisms, etc. Buschmann et. al. 
demonstrates that dynamics simulation is a valuable tool for 
biped robot hardware and controller design [14], and 
Hirukawa et. al. shows the correspondence between dynamic 
simulations and the experiments of biped walking of 
humanoid robots [15]. Here, instead of developing 
customized dynamic environment by ourselves, we utilize 
commercial software ADAMS and Matlab to simulate the 
designed gait. After that, the designed gaits are applied to our 
physical robot for experimental evaluation.  
Section II briefly reports the leg design, including joint 
arrangement, mechanical design, and mechatronics 
subsections. Section III and IV describe the walking and 
turning trajectory generation, respectively. Section V 
introduces the simulation work, and Section VI reports the 
experiment evaluation of walking and turning behaviors. 
Section VII concludes the work.

II. LEG DESIGN 
A. Degree of freedom of the leg 
Considering robot design, there  
always exists trade-offs among 
active/passive degree of freedoms 
(DOFs), mobility, flexibility system 
complexity, and controllability.  
Great mobility is the common goal; 
however, how to select right 
components is indeed not an easy task. 
By comparing with various existing 
humanoid robots around the world, in 
the current prototype we utilize 12 
active DOFs in the whole leg 
mechanism. As shown in the Figure 1, 
3 DOFs, 1 DOF, and 2 DOFs are used 
at hip joint, knee joint, and ankle joint, 
respectively.  
B. Mechanical Design 
Motor Maxon RE-series brushed DC motors are selected 
based on their high performance and easy interface with 
general amplifier circuits. The detailed selection of particular 
models is based on the preliminary static analysis as well as 
result from Adams simulation. 
Harmonic drive Instead of gearbox, harmonic drive is 
used in our system for major speed reduction due to its 
excellent performance of limited backlash as well as compact 
size with high reduction ratio. 
Belt and pulley Because of geometrical constraints, it is 
impossible to connect selected motors to the corresponding 
harmonic drives directly in the multi-DOF hip and ankle joints. 
Thus, in these two joints several DOFs are also designed with 
timing belt-pulley transmission system between the motors 
and the harmonic drives. In addition, this also preserves the

The motor drive unit contains a motor drive board and a 
sub-breakout board. To simplify the electronic layout and 
wiring, custom breakout boards are designed to be placed next 
to the motor amplifiers near all driving axes as shown in 
Figure 6.Due to the rest space of the mechanism and the 
number of motors, we design six different motor drive units. 
Fig. 7 is one of the motor drive units. 
So far, we have finished the integration between 
mechanisms and electronic circuits. Before we applied the 
trajectories to the robot, homing for the robot is a preliminary 
work because we must make sure that the gesture of robot is 
straight and can stand on the ground. Figure 8 illustrates the 
motion of homing. The steps of homing include roll, yaw, 
pitch orientation, and the motors rotate until the photo 
interrupters detect the edge of the workspace of the joints, and 
then the motors rotate reversely back to the homing position. 
After homing for the robot, we finally finish mechatronic 
integration and hardware work, and then we can apply the 
desired trajectories to carry out gait experiments. 
III. WALKING TRAJECTORY PLANNING  
While biped robot walks stably, not only reaction force 
between sole and ground and inertia force but also all the 
moment created by those force must balance, so the ZMP 
(Zero-Moment Point) of the  robot on the sole must  lie in the 
support plane on the ground [8]. In order to simplify dynamic 
model, there are some assumptions needed to be considered. 
Furthermore, it is necessary to consider two general phases 
when robot walks, one is SS (Single Support) phase, and the 
other is DS (double support) phase. Because the underlying 
physical principals are different, the trajectory of COM is 
derived from different dynamic models.  
    This section describes how to generate COM trajectories 
while the robot operates in the SS and DS phases. In the single 
support phase, the inverted pendulum model is used to 
generate the trajectory of COM. Figure. 9 explains the 
simplified model in the sagittal x-z plane, which assumes 
point mass, weightless leg , and no-slip on the ground.. M is 
the mass of robot, g represents gravity, r is the vector from the 
contact point to the center of mass, and τ is zero if the inverted 
pendulum is a joint contact with ground. In order to reduce the 
calculation when producing the trajectory, there is a constraint, 
the height is constant, added to the inverted model, and this 
model is called a linear inverted pendulum. Figure 10 shows 
the free body diagram of the inverted pendulum model with 
constant height. Mg represents the gravity force, f is the 
reacting force by the ground, and  is the inertia force 
created by the acceleration. In addition, this model is not only 
generating the trajectory for the single support phase but also 
providing the initial and final condition for the double support 
phase. 
While the robot walks, there is one double support phase 
between two single support phases, but the linear inverted 
pendulum is not suitable for the double support phase. 
Therefore, to keep continuous motion when the phase 
changing, the polynomial is used to connect the trajectory for 
the double support phase with initial and final conditions 
mentioned in the previous paragraph in Fig. 11.

right turn, the motor of left hip yaw turns to make the body 
turn right during Body Turn. Then, in Leg Turn, the robot lifts 
the left leg up and the motor of left hip yaw turns back to make 
two legs parallel to each other. So, in this turning mode, there 
is only one motor of hip yaw that turns during the whole 
turning process. The top view of the robot motion in Body 
Turn First mode is in Figure 16, and, here the green line means 
the trajectory of COM. 
B. The Second Turning Mode: Leg Turn First 
The second turning mode was generated by changing the 
orders of Body Turn and Leg Turn. The flowchart is in Fig. 17, 
and the Fig. 18 shows the top view of the robot turning in Leg 
Turn First mode. In Leg Turn, the motor of right leg hip yaw 
turns to turn the right leg into new direction. Then the motor of 
right leg hip yaw turns back and let the body of robot turns in 
Body Turn. It also only uses one of the two hip yaw motors to 
turn. 
C. The Third Turning Mode: Simultaneity Turn 
In the design of the biped robot, there are some restrictions 
in mechanism that limit the work angle of the motor in hip yaw 
from -40 degrees to 40 degrees. Because of the restriction of 
mechanism, the maximum angle that robot can turn is under 
40 degrees. Therefore, Simultaneity Turn mode is used to 
make the robot turn more. The flowchart of the third mode is 
showed in Fig. 19. In Simultaneity Turn mode, if the robot 
takes a   turning motion, one of the motors in hip yaw takes a  
2/ turn and the other takes a 2/ turn in Simultaneity 
Turn 1st, and the body takes a 2/  turn. And in the 
Simultaneity Turn 2nd, each of those two motors turns back. 
After Simultaneity Turn 2nd, the robot finishes a whole   
turn. Simultaneity Turn mode could overcome the restriction 
of mechanism and let the angle that the biped robot is able to

VI.  EXPERIMENT EVALUATION 
A. Walking Experiments 
In the walking Experiments,  the effect of clearance from 
mechanism appears during Single Support step. So, in order to 
reduce the effect, the motor in hip roll of the support leg  needs 
a compensation of angle.  Figure 26 and figure 27 show the 
snapshots of the walking experiment. Figure 26 is the front 
view and figure 27 is the side view. After finding the suitable 
walking parameters, five experiments have been carried out, 
and those walking parameter are in figure 28. The 
measurement data of the figure are collected from current 
sensor and calculated with the parameters. The power 
efficiency is evaluated according to the “specific resistance” 
[21], which was determined by weight of the robot, mg, its 
averaged power consumption, P, and its averaged forward 
speed, v. It’s shown below:  
mgv
P
S  . 
There are some conclusions in TABLE I, the average 
power consumption in five experiment is almost the same, and 
the maximum currents in experiment 2 and 4 are much greater   
than the other because the clearance compensation need more 
torque to fix the clearance, in this way, the robot have well 
landing. The smallest specific resistance of those experiments 
is experiment 5 because its walk speed is the biggest and the 
power variation of different experiments is quite small.

are three experiments to show the performance of the robot 
when it takes a 10 degrees left turn. The first turning mode is 
shown in Fig 28. The results of the second mode and the third 
mode are shown in Fig.29 and Fig.30.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we report on the development and system 
integration of the human-size biped robot. The robot has 12 
DOFs, 6 DOFs on each leg. The mechatronic system is 
customized to fit with commercial embedded system 
single-board RIO from NI. The walking trajectory is mainly 
composed of the single support phase with the linear-inverted 
pendulum model and the stable double-support phase in 
between. The derived trajectory are simulated in physical 
engine (Matlab and ADAMS) before the  robot experiments, 
to make sure their stability properties. The robot can 
successfully walk in the simulation environment. After that, 
the empirical experiments are executed. The robot can stably 
walk at 1.08m per minute and can turn 30deg per stride. The 
performance confirms that development of the human-size 
biped robot is successful. 
We are currently in the process of developing feedback 
strategy which utilizes the sensory information of 6-axis force 
transducer and 6-axis IMU; thus the locomotion can be 
performed in the environment with disturbance.
