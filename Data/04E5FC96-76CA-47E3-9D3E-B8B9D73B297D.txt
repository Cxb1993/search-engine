Abstract 
This study investigated the electrochemical and corrosion performance of Mg–Li–Al–Zn 
anodes with Al compositions of ~3 wt.% and ~9 wt.%. Mg–Li–Al–Zn alloy with~9 wt.% Al had 
a relatively negative open-circuit potential and a high discharge voltage in MgCl2 electrolyte, 
owing to the distribution of numerous AlLi particles in the matrix of the alloy. AlLi particles 
were believed to transform to Al particles during the corrosion of the Mg–Li–Al–Zn anode. The 
high-Al anode material exhibited good corrosion performance since a dense and continuous 
Mg(OH)2/Al composite layer covered the surface of the high-Al anode. Experimentally, increas-
ing the Li+ concentration in the electrolyte improved the corrosion performance of the Mg anode.

2.2. Observation of cross-sectional microstructure 
and X-ray diffraction analysis 
Mg alloy foils (0.2 mm × 10 mm × 15 mm) 
were mounted in epoxy resin, ground and finally 
polished with alumina powder in 99.5 vol. % 
ethanol solution until they were mirror-bright.  
Some cross-sectional microstructures of AZ31, 
LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 alloy foils were observed 
under an optical microscope.  The crystal struc-
tures of Mg foils were characterized by X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV at 
a scanning rate of 1 degree min-1. 
2.3. Open-circuit potential measurement 
A Princeton Applied Research Model 263A 
Potentiostat/Galvanostat was employed to deter-
mine the electrochemical properties of the samples.  
All tests were performed at room temperature.  
The corrosion cell used in present work was a 
three-electrode assembly, in which platinum foil 
and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter electrode 
and the reference electrode, respectively.  Mg 
alloy foils with an exposed area of 150 mm2 were 
applied as the working electrode.  A 2 mol Kg-1 
MgCl2 aqueous electrolyte solution ([Cl-] = 4 mol 
Kg-1) was prepared from ACS grade MgCl2 (E. 
Merck, Germany) in deionized water, with a pH 
value of 5.69 ± 0.07.  Open-circuit potential was 
measured in the corrosion cell that contained 300 
ml MgCl2 solution.  Measuring time was 1 hour. 
2.4. Discharge studies 
Figure 1 schematically shows the experimen-
tal setup that was used to investigate anode effi-
ciency and discharge behaviour.  As shown in the 
figure, highly pure copper foil (+0.34 V vs. SHE 
[20]) was selected as the cathode material.  Cop-
per has been used as a cathode material in a simple 
Volta battery [21].  Copper (cathode) and Mg 
alloy foil (anode) of equal size (0.2 mm × 10 mm 
× 15 mm) were fixed to two copper strips (2 mm × 
25 mm × 90 mm) that were separated by a Teflon® 
block (10.5 mm × 25 mm × 70 mm) (see Fig. 1).  
Each Mg alloy foil was weighed prior to discharge 
test.  The device was lifted by a Teflon® support 
in a beaker that contained 100 ml of 2 mol Kg-1 
MgCl2 electrolyte solution.  The cell was dis-
charged at constant discharge currents of 1, 10, 20 
and 30 mA each for 1 hour.  The Mg foils after 
discharge tests were then immersed in a boiling 
15% CrO3 solution of 1% Ag2CrO4 for 3 minutes.  
The specimens were rinsed in 99.5 vol. % ethanol 
solution, and then dried at 120 °C for 12 hours.  
The dried samples were weighed.  The difference 
between the weight of the sample before immer-
sion and that of the dried sample was actual 
weight loss.  Anode efficiency was calculated by 
dividing the theoretical weight loss by the actual 
weight loss.  The equation is:

at constant discharge currents of 10, 20 and 30 mA 
(6.67, 13.33 and 20 mA cm-2) to a cut-off voltage 
of 0.1 V.  Capacities of the cells (Mg foils/2 mol 
Kg-1 MgCl2/Cu) were calculated using the follow-
ing equation [24;

At least four samples were tested for each meas-
urement of anode efficiency and discharge behav-
iour. 
2.5. Examination of Mg samples following immer-
sion in electrolyte 
AZ31, LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 foils were 
immersed, respectively, in 100 ml of 2 mol Kg-1 
MgCl2 solution at 30 ± 1 °C for 5 hours.  The 
exposed area was 150 mm2.  At the end of the 
experiments, each Mg alloy sample was removed 
from the solution, and then rinsed with deionized 
water and dried.  Some of the samples were 
mounted in epoxy resin, and then ground on sili-
con carbide grinding papers.  Ethanol was used 
as lubricant.  Afterward, the samples were pol-
ished by alumina slurry (alumina powder mixed 
with ethanol) until the samples were mirror-bright.  
Surface morphologies and cross-sectional micro-
structures of the samples were elucidated using 
FE-SEM (JEOL JSM model 6700F).  Images 
were obtained by backscattered electron (BSE) 
imaging.  The corrosion products that formed on 
samples’ surfaces were investigated by glancing 
angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) using Cu Kα 
radiation at 40 kV and a scanning speed of 1 de-
gree min-1.  Glancing incidence angle was set to 1 
degree.  Electron spectroscopy for chemical 
analysis (ESCA) was employed to examine the 
surface of Mg-Li-Al-Zn samples.  ESCA analysis 
was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 
250 spectrometer with an Mg and Al dual-anode 
X-ray source.  Mg Kα of 1253.6 eV was adopted 
as an X-ray source in this study.  After sputtering 
the Mg-Li-Al-Zn sample surface by Ar ion for 500 
seconds, an analysis was carried out.  The area of 
the analysis was about 1 mm square.  During the 
 4 
ever, their research only focused on the corrosion 
of the Al alloys, the effect of the AlLi particles on 
discharge behaviour was not discussed [30].  In 
the present work, much more AlLi particles were 
present in LAZ1291 sample than in LAZ1231 
sample (see X-ray patterns in Fig. 2(a), and the 
microstructures in Figs. 2(c) and (d) for compari-
son).  According to Haferkamp et al. [13], the 
electrochemical potential of AlLi phase (-1.960 V 
vs. SHE) is much more negative than bcc Mg ma-
trix (-1.258 V vs. SHE) in standardized 
ASTM-seawater.  Experimentally, the present 
work suggested that AlLi particles had strong ef-
fect on lowering the OCP of Mg alloy (Fig. 3) and 
increasing the discharge voltage (Fig. 5) of 
Mg-Li-Al-Zn anode material in MgCl2 electrolyte. 
3.3. Corrosion performance and microstructural 
characterization 
Figure 7(a) presents the glancing-angle X-ray 
diffraction (GAXRD) patterns of the three Mg al-
loy foils that had been immersed in 2 mol Kg-1 
MgCl2 solution for 5 hours.  The spectrum of 
AZ31 sample included sharp hcp magnesium and 
relatively weak Mg(OH)2 peaks.  The diffraction 
patterns of both LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 samples 
yield high X-ray intensities of Mg(OH)2, indicat-
ing that the X-ray signals were mainly from the 
corrosion product on each sample surface.  AlLi 
and Al peaks were also observed in the spectra of 
LAZ1231 and LAZ1291.  Figures 7(b), (c) and (d) 
show cross-sectional microstructures (BSE images 
obtained by FE-SEM) of AZ31, LAZ1231 and 
LAZ1291 samples, respectively.  An irregular 
and loose Mg(OH)2 corrosion product (grey con-
trast) was observed on the surface of the AZ31 
sample (Fig. 7(b)).  Similar corrosion morphol-
ogy was observed in an AZ31 alloy that was im-
mersed in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution [16].  Contrar-
ily, uniform and contiguous Mg(OH)2 layers were 
found on both LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 samples, 
as presented in Figs. 7(c) and (d), respectively.  
Figures 8(a) and (b) display high-magnification 
BSE images of cross-sectional microstructures of 
LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 samples, respectively.   
AlLi particles (arrowed with black arrows) dis-
tributed in the bcc Mg matrix of LAZ1231 and 
LAZ1291 samples.  Particles, as indicated by 
white arrows, distributed in the Mg(OH)2 films of 
both LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 samples.  The inset 
in Fig. 8(a) is an enlarged BSE image of the parti-
cles that were present in Mg(OH)2 layer on 
LAZ1231 sample.  The outside of the particles 
appears white; the inside appears black.  The par-
ticle size was ~1 µm (see Fig. 8(a)).  The parti-
cles, as shown in Fig. 8(b), in the Mg(OH)2 layer 
on LAZ1291 sample had ~2 µm in diameter.  
Cracks are present in the Mg(OH)2 layers (Figs. 
8(a) and (b)).  As presented in Fig. 8(a) (from 
LAZ1231 sample), several cracks penetrated 
Mg(OH)2 layer from surface to the substrate metal.  
Cracks that penetrated through the whole thick-
ness of Mg(OH)2 layer were not found in 
LAZ1291 sample (as shown in Fig. 8(b)).  Figure 
9 plots the corrosion rates of LAZ1291, LAZ1231 
and AZ31 samples in 2 mol Kg-1 MgCl2 solution at 
30 ± 1 °C for 5 hours.  The corrosion rates of the 
three Mg alloys in 2 mol Kg-1 MgCl2 solution fol-
lowed the order LAZ1291<LAZ1231<AZ31. 
AZ31 alloy had the highest corrosion rate 
among the three Mg alloys (as shown in Fig. 9).  
Chloride solutions aggressively corrode magne-
sium because chlorides, even in small amounts, 
typically break down Mg(OH)2 film on magne-
sium surface by replacing OH- with Cl- and to 
form the highly water-soluble MgCl2 [31,32] or 
MgOHCl [33] (For example, 55 g of MgCl2 can 
dissolve in 100 ml of water at 20 ºC [34]).  The 
corrosion rates of LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 sam-
ples were both lower than that of the AZ31 sample 
(Fig. 9).  Corrosion of LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 
in aqueous MgCl2 caused dissolution of some bcc 
Mg matrix.  Thus, the addition of Li+ in chloride 
solution due to the corrosion could occur.  
Sivashanmugam et al. [11] suggested that when 
Mg-13 wt.% Li alloy is immersed in 2 mol L-1 
MgCl2 solution, Li+ due to the corrosion of the 
Mg-Li alloy anodically generates LiCl compound 
until the compound precipitates out as an imper-
vious layer in the pores of the superficial hydrox-
ide layer.  It was reported that the LiCl com-
pound increases the corrosion resistance of the 
Mg-Li alloy [11].  However, LiCl is highly wa-
ter-soluble (63.7 g of LiCl can dissolve in 100 ml 
of water at 0 ºC [35]).  Moreover, in the present 
work, no LiCl intensity peak was identified in the 
glancing angle X-ray diffraction patterns.  To 
elucidate the effect of Li+ on corrosion, AZ31 foil 
was immersed in aqueous MgCl2 with LiCl addi-
tive.  The concentrations of lithium ions in the 
solutions were 0, 0.5 and 1 mol Kg-1.  Figure 10 
plots the corrosion rates of AZ31 foil in aqueous 
MgCl2 with different Li+ concentrations.  The 
corrosion rate decreased as Li+ ion content in-
creased.  The result indicates that, even in rela-
tively concentrated chloride solution, the presence 
of Li+ ions could evidently reduce the corrosion 
rate of AZ31 foil. 
Figures 11(a) and (b) present cross-sectional 
BSE images of LAZ1231 and LAZ1291 samples, 
respectively, that had been immersed in MgCl2 
electrolyte for 5 hours, together with their corre-
sponding mappings of magnesium and aluminium 
in the analyzed field.  AlLi particles in bcc Mg 
matrix were indicated by black arrows while parti-
cles in corrosion product, Mg(OH)2, were indi-
cated by white arrows (Fig. 11).  The mapping 
results reveal that the AlLi particles and the parti-

powders include Al [13,14] and Mg [15-17].  
However, preparation of metallic powder gen-
erally utilizes the high-energy ball-mill method 
with milling time as long as 8 h [15,16].  Thus, 
costs are incurred by the additional energy used 
for the preparation of the metallic powder.  
Additionally, hydrogen production using metal-
lic waste has recently been investigated [18-21].  
Martínez et al. [18,19] proposed a method using 
aluminum used beverage can (Al UBC).  The 
decoated Al UBC was immersed in a highly 
concentrated NaOH water solution to produce 
H2. 
The authors of the present work investigated 
the possibility of generating hydrogen from the 
hydrolysis of low-grade magnesium scrap 
(LGMS) in NaCl solution [20,21].  However, 
in our previous studies [21] metallic catalyst (Pt 
coated Ti) net has to be pressed on Mg sample 
and rotated against the Mg sample simultane-
ously for a better H2 generation rate [21].  That 
is, extra energy is required during the H2 gen-
eration [21].  In this study, a hot dipping proc-
ess was investigated to combine low-grade Mg 
scrap (LGMS) and metallic catalyst (AISI 304 
stainless steel net) together.  Extra energy was 
not required during H2 generation in NaCl solu-
tion. 
Corrosion of Mg alloy in a NaCl solution is 
generally accompanied by H2 generation [22].  
Notably, Mg alloy is one of the most active 
metals in the galvanic series, and its corrosion 
potential (Ecorr) is −1.67 V/S.H.E. [23].  The 
corrosion potential of AISI 304 stainless steel 
(−0.38 V/S.H.E. [23]) is much nobler than Mg 
alloy.  Accordingly, macrogalvanic corrosion 
occurs when Mg alloy contacts steel.  Based 
on the overall reaction of the corrosion of mag-
nesium [22], the chemical reaction herein may 
be expressed as: 
LGMS+2H2O  H2 (g) + Mg(OH)2 (s)(1) 
The half-chemical reaction of anode and cath-
ode are shown as: 
Anode (LGMS):Mg  Mg2+ + 2 e-   (2) 
Cathode (AISI 304 S.S.): 2 H2O + 2 e-   H2 
+ 2 OH-                  (3) 
In this study, LGMS coupled with AISI 304 
stainless steel net was placed in NaCl solutions 
to accelerate the generation of H2 and Mg(OH)2 
via the chemical reaction.  The effect of NaCl 
solution in different concentrations and vol-
umes on the amount of hydrogen generated was 
examined.  The conversion of the generated 
hydrogen to electricity via a PEM fuel cell 
stack was also reported. 
2. Experimental procedure 
In this study, LGMS (i.e., post-consumer or 
end-of-life Mg products) was used as the raw 
material for hydrogen generation.  The 
chemical compositions of the LGMS (in wt.%) 
were 15.58 Al, 0.60 Si, 0.13 Fe, 0.015 Ni, 0.1 
Cu, 0.77 Zn, 0.17 Mn; Mg made up the balance.  
Compared with the chemical composition of an 
AZ91D alloy (one of the most popular Mg al-
loys), the alloy should have 8.5–9.5 Al, 0.08 
max Si, 0.004 max Fe, 0.001 max Ni, 0.025 
max Cu, 0.45–0.9 Zn, and 0.17–0.4 Mn, with 
the balance as Mg (according to ASTM B93 
specification [24]).  In the present study, AISI 
304 stainless steel (AISI S.S.) net was used as 
catalyst.  First, the LGMS was remelted into a 
semi-solid state at about 580oC.  Second, 75% 
of the area of the 304 S.S. net was dipped into 
the LGMS bath such that the net had an LGMS 
overlayer covering.  Figure 1 shows the dipped 
samples.  Hereafter, LGMS/S.S. represents a 
sample of LGMS combined with AISI 304 
stainless steel net.  One piece of the 
LGMS/S.S. couple (as shown in Fig. 1) was 
placed in a sealed stainless-steel reactor (1.5 
liters) or a sealed PP reactor (3.5 liters), respec-
tively.  The NaCl solutions of different con-
centrations (3.5, 7, 14 and 28 wt.%) were pre-
pared and pumped from a storage tank until it 
filled the reactor.  The generated hydrogen 
then went through a low temperature dehumidi-
fier (−15±1oC) to condense most water vapor 
out of the H2 steams.  The generation rate (li-
ter/min) was measured by a mass flow meter 
(M-10SLPM-D) (Alicat Scientific Co., Ltd.) 
and recorded by a personal computer via a data 
acquisition device.  Total volume of generated 
H2 was calculated by integrating the experi-
mentally measured H2 generation rate over 
time. 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 2 presents the hydrogen generation 
data for LGMS/S.S. couple in NaCl solution of 
different concentrations and volumes.  Figure 
2(a) shows the volume of generated H2 as a 
function of NaCl concentration.  In general, 
the volume of generated H2 increased in the
