ABSTRACT 
 
In the present study, we perform the statistical dynamic analysis on the bridge–vehicle interaction 
problem with randomness in material properties and moving loads. The bridge is modeled as a laminated 
composite beam with Gaussian random elastic modulus and mass density of material with moving forces on 
top. These forces are time varying with a coefficient of variation at each time instance and they are 
considered as Gaussian random processes. The first order shear deformation theory is assumed for the 
laminated composite beam model. The mathematical model of the bridge–vehicle system is established based 
on the finite element model in which the Gaussian random processes are represented by the Karhunen–Loéve 
expansion and the equations are solved by the Newmark-β method. Some statistical properties such as the 
mean value and standard deviation of the structural response are obtained, and the results based on the 
proposed method match with those from Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, the effects on the dynamic 
deflections due to different vehicle velocity and different driving frequency of the moving loads are 
investigated.

1. Introduction 
 
Recently, bridge condition evaluation has been very popular among the researchers, and the evaluation 
under operation condition is the main problem to be investigated in practice. When a vehicle passes over a 
bridge deck, an amplification of the dynamic response will occur which needs to be considered in the 
response analysis for the evaluation. The dynamic response of a bridge structure under moving vehicular 
loads has been investigated for decades. Fryba [1] presented the analytical solutions for simply supported and 
continuous beams with uniform cross-section. Green and Cebon [2] obtained the solution on the dynamic 
response of an Euler–Bernoulli beam in the frequency domain under a “quarter-car” vehicle model using an 
iterative procedure with experimental verification. Similar work was also investigated by Yang and Lin [3] 
who studied the dynamic interaction between a moving vehicle and the supporting bridge using the modal 
superposition technique with closed-form solution. Research on a multi-span non-uniform beam under a 
moving load was conducted by Zheng et al. [4]. The beam bridge model was extended by Zhu and Law [5] to 
an orthotropic rectangular plate simply supported on a pair of parallel edges under a stream of moving loads 
based on the Lagrange equation and modal superposition. Marchesiello et al. [6] also proposed an analytical 
approach to the vehicle–bridge dynamic interaction problem with a seven degrees-of-freedom vehicle system 
moving on a multi-span continuous bridge deck modeled as an isotropic plate. 
For more complex bridge–vehicle models, the finite element method has been utilized to perform the 
dynamic interaction analysis. Henchi et al. [7] presented an efficient algorithm for the dynamic analysis of a 
bridge discretized into three-dimensional finite elements with a stream of vehicles running on top at a 
prescribed speed. The vehicular axle loads acting on the bridge deck are represented as nodal forces using 
shape functions of the finite element. The coupled equations of motion of the bridge–vehicle system are 
A simply supported beam with various constitutive materials is the most popular structure that has 
ever been adopted in the study of vehicle induced vibrations. Laminated composite and functionally graded 
beams due to their appropriate properties are extensively used in the engineering structures. Hence, it is 
necessary to know the dynamic characteristics of these structures subjected to the dynamic loads in 
environmental conditions. Kadivar and Mohebpour [26] developed a solution based on a FEM for three 
deformation theories (classical lamination theory, first order shear deformation theory and higher order shear 
deformation theory) to study the dynamic response of the orthotropic laminated composite beams with shear 
effect and rotary inertia under the actions of moving loads. Chen derived the dynamic equilibrium equations 
of composite nonprismatic beams made of anisotropic materials considering the effects of transverse shear 
deformations and structural damping using Hamilton’s principle [27]. Lin and Chen investigated the 
problems of dynamic stability of spinning pre-twisted sandwich beams with a constrained damping layer 
subjected to periodic axial loads by using the FEM [28]. Kim presented the dynamic stability behavior of the 
damped laminated beam under the uniformly distributed subtangential forces using the finite element 
formulation based on kinematic assumptions consistent with Vlasov beam theory. The effects of various 
boundary conditions, fiber orientation and external and internal damping have been studied [29]. Simsek and 
Kocatürk studied the free and forced vibration behavior of a functionally graded (FG) beam subjected to a 
concentrated moving harmonic load [30]. They derived the equations of motion by using Lagrange’s 
equations under the assumptions of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. Simsek investigated the vibration of FG 
beams under a moving mass considering the different beam theories using the Lagrange’s equations [31]. 
Also, he studied the non-linear vibration analysis of a FG Timoshenko beam under action of a harmonic load 
[32].  Recently, Mohebpour et al. [33] investigated the dynamic response of composite laminated beams 
subjected to the moving oscillator by using an algorithm based on the finite element method. The first order 
shear deformation theory (FSDT) is assumed in their beam model.   
A stochastic finite element model is proposed in the present study for the dynamic response 
calculation of a bridge structure considering stochastic loading with inherent randomness in a bridge–vehicle 
system. The algorithm based on the proposed model can handle complex random excitation forces with large 
uncertainties and relatively small uncertainties in system parameters. The bridge is modeled as a simply 
supported laminated composite beam with Gaussian random elastic modulus and mass density of material 
and random moving forces on top. The forces have time-varying mean values and a coefficient of variation at 
each time instance, and they are considered as Gaussian random processes. The equation of motion of the 
bridge–vehicle system is presented using the Karhunen–Loéve expansion and the response statistics are 
obtained by solving the system equation of motion using the Newmark-β method. Some of the numerical 
results based on the proposed stochastic approach are checked by those obtained from the Monte Carlo 
simulation.

the structure, respectively. M, C, K are the stochastic mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the bridge

In the following numerical computations, the laminated composite beam under a harmonic moving load with 
constant velocity is dealt with using the FSDT and the proposed method.  The following properties of the

The elastic modulus and mass density are assumed as Gaussian random process and they have the 
spatial correlation represented by an exponential auto-covariance function as:

where    is the standard deviation of the system parameter,   and 1 2| |x x are the correlation 
length and the positive dislocation of two points in a spatial domain of interest which are set to be 1m and 5m, 
respectively. Both the random elastic modulus and mass density are assumed with the same spatial 
correlation and the same level of Coefficient of Variation (COV). In the present study, COV is assumed as 
10% for the elastic modulus, mass density and the harmonic moving load. In addition, the damping ratio is 
assumed to be the same for all the modes. 
In Fig. 2, the time history of mean value of the non-dimensional dynamic deflections at the midspan are 
presented for various values of the damping ratio in the case of * 0.10, * 0.0.V     It is noted that the 
non-dimensional dynamic deflections are normalized by the static deflection, D, of a beam under a point load 
0P  at the midspan. As it can be seen from Fig. 2, the non-dimensional dynamic deflections get smaller as the 
damping ratio increases, in addition, the numerical results based on the present study are checked by the 
Monte Carlo simulation and they are in excellent agreements. Fig. 3 shows the time history of standard 
deviation of the non-dimensional dynamic deflections at the midspan, the results from the Monte Carlo 
simulation are a little higher than those from the present study, especially for zero damping ratio. 
Nevertheless, they are still in fairly good agreements. Figs. 4-5 present the mean value and standard deviation 
of the non-dimensional dynamic deflections at the midspan individually for the case of * 0.10, * 0.20.V      
Once again, the numerical results from the present study match pretty well with those from Monte Carlo 
simulation as it can be found from Figs 4-5. As the frequency ratio increases from 0.00 to 0.20, the maximum 
non-dimensional dynamic deflections at the midspan also increase, which is quite reasonable. For simplicity, 
the Monte Carlo simulation check won’t be performed in the following figures. Figs. 6-7 present the  
mean value of the non-dimensional dynamic deflections at the midspan for various values of the damping 
ratio in the case of * 0.10, * 0.50V     and * 0.10, * 1.00.V     According to the figures 2, 4, 6 and 7, 
different velocity parameter depending on the excitation frequency ratio. It should be noted that the statistical 
dynamic response based on the proposed method plays an important role in estimating the structural 
reliability of the bridge-vehicle system. 
 
 
 
8. SELF-EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT REPORT 
This project report has accomplished most contents and goals proposed by the original project, also the 
academic values of this research are very promising and outstanding. However, the original proposal applied for 
two-year projects but was only approved by NSC for one year. Therefore, the statistical dynamic analysis of 
laminated composite plates in Bridge-Vehicle interaction problem is not performed in the current project report. 
Part of the results from this research has been organized and has already been submitted to SCI journal in 
January, 2013 for possible publication.

2. ROD MODEL BASED ON NONLOCAL 
ELASTICITY THEORY  
Based on Eringen nonlocal elasticity model20, the stress at a 
reference point x in a body is considered as a function of strains of 
all the points in the near region. The above assumption is in 
agreement with the atomic theory of lattice dynamics and 
experimental observations on phonon dispersion. Consider a 
homogeneous and isotropic elastic solid, the constitutive equation 
is 
0( ) : (| |, ) ( ) ( )
V
dV    σ x C x x ε x x            (1) 
where symbols ‘:’ is the inner product with double contraction, 
0C  is the elastic stiffness matrix of classical isotropic elasticity, σ(x)  denotes the nonlocal stress tensor at x, and ε(x )  is the 
strain tensor at any point x′ in the body. The kernel function 
(| |, ) x x  is the nonlocal modulus, | | x x is the 
Euclidean distance, and 0 /e a l   , where 0e  is a constant 
appropriate to each material, a is an internal characteristic size 
(e.g. size of C–C bond, lattice spacing, granular distance) and l  
is an external characteristic size (crack size, wave length etc.). The 
volume integral in Eq. (1) is over the region V occupied by the 
body. The kernel function is given as 20 
2 1
0(| |, ) (2 ) ( / )l K l    x x x                (2) 
where 0K  is the modified Bessel function.  
By incorporating Eq. (1) and (2), the following equation can be 
derived  
2 2 2
0 0(1 ) :e a  σ C ε                               (3) 
Based on Eq. (3), the equation of motion for free-vibrating axial 
non-uniform and non-homogeneous nanorod in the nonlocal 
elasticity can be derived in the following form: 
   2220 2 2 ,( , )( ) ( ) 1 ( ) u x tu x tE x A x e a m xx x x t
             
    (4)  
 
where  ,u x t  is the axial displacement, m(x) is the mass per unit 
length, E(x) is the Young’s modulus and ( )A x  is the area of 
cross-section of the non-uniform and non-homogeneous nanorod 
respectively. Eq. (4) is the consistent fundamental equation of the 
nonlocal non-uniform and non-homogeneous rod model for axial 
vibration of a thin rod. It is noted that the scale 0e a  in the Eq. (4) 
will lead to small scale effect on the response of non-uniform and 
non-homogeneous nanorod, furthermore, the classical (local) 
elasticity theory is recovered if the scale coefficient 0e a  is set to 
be zero. In the present study, clamped–clamped (CC) and 
clamped–free (CF) boundary conditions are studied and the 
related conditions are given as follows: 
: (0, ) ( , ) 0
: (0, ) ( , ) 0
CC u t u L t
CF u t N L t
 
                         (5) 
where N denotes axial force per unit length for nonlocal elasticity 
and L is the length of the non-uniform and non-homogeneous 
nanorod. 
 
3. SOLUTIONS BY FINITE ELEMENT 
METHOD  
In the present study, the finite element method is used to 
determine the solutions to Eqs. (4-5). The finite element 
formulation is generally effective for obtaining approximate 
solutions for complicated problems with high accuracy. With 
account of boundary conditions, the finite element formulation in 
the spatial domain is then given by  
      0M U K U                                (6) 
where  U  is a vector of the system global displacements of the 
structure and [ ]M and [ ]K  are global mass and stiffness 
matrices of the nonlocal nanorods, respectively. For a self-excited 
vibration, the solution of Eq. (6) can be written in the following 
form: 
   sin( )U U t                                    (7) 
Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. 6), a generalized eigenvalue problem 
can be achieved as follows: 
     2( ) 0M K U                               (8) 
where   and  U  are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
the system. To determine a non-trivial solution to Eq. (8), the 
determinant of the coefficient matrix must vanish, that is, 
   2det( ) 0M K                              (9) 
Based on the above equation, the natural frequencies (eigenvalues) 
of the nonlocal non-uniform and non-homogeneous nanorods can 
be computed for various parameter values. 
 
4. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
In the present study, the non-uniform and non-homogeneous 
nanorod is assumed as hollow to have an inner diameter  id  of 
0.35 nm and an outer diameter 0d  of 0.95 nm at x=0. The 
thickness of the nanorod is taken as h=0.30 nm, and the inner 
diameter of the nanorod at any point is  2( ) 1 / 4i id x d x L   
and the outer diameter is hxdxd i 2)()(0  . The mass density 
and the Young’s modulus of the nanorod are assumed respectively 
as follows:  
0( ) [1 0.2cos( / )],x x L   

5. CONCLUSION 
An elastic rod model is developed to study the small scale effect 
on axial vibration of non-uniform and non-homogeneous nanorods 
by using the theory of nonlocal elasticity. The finite element 
method is adopted to obtain the numerical solutions to the model. 
The effects of nonlocal small scale, different lengths, mode 
numbers and different boundary conditions on the vibration 
frequency of the non-uniform and non-homogeneous nanorods are 
investigated. The frequency ratio is defined as the ratio of nonlocal 
frequency to local frequency to illustrate the effects of small length 
scale on the axial vibration of non-uniform and non-homogeneous 
nanorods. Several results are presented on the variation of natural 
frequency ratio of the non-uniform and non-homogeneous 
nanorods for various parameter values. It can be concluded that 
the nonlocal frequency is less than the local (classical) frequency 
thanks to the effect of small length scale. In addition, increasing 
the nonlocal scale coefficient tends to decrease the frequency ratio, 
which is equivalent to decrease the frequency of the non-uniform 
and non-homogeneous nanorods. Furthermore, the frequency ratio 
decreases with the increase of the non-uniform and 
non-homogeneous nanorod length and the nonlocal effects 
disappear when the length exceeds a certain value. Finally, it is 
detected that the nonlocal effects are more pronounced for higher 
modes and stiffer structure. All the finding of the present study can 
be treated as good reference on the axial vibration of single-walled 
carbon nanotubes.
