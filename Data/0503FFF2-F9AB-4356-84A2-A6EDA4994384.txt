11.前言與文獻探討
越來越多的產品講究輕薄短小，在現今快速的社會中，文數字輸入的按鍵配置套用在微
型產品上早以不敷使用。要讓使用者在打字作業上避免手部或其他身體上的傷害風險，又要
兼顧維持使用者對速度的要求，克服使用者對傳統文數字按鍵的慣性依賴，必須從按鍵的既
有設計與使用方式做改善與創新設計。文數字輸入設備依使用地點可分做固定式與攜帶式。
固定式輸入設備以鍵盤為代表，攜帶式輸入設備以手機最為常用。本研究欲探討文數字輸入
按鍵，創新設計新式按鍵，來提昇文數字輸入的績效，評估新式按鍵應用在鍵盤與手機上的
輸入績效。
以資訊產品來說，使用者介面可分為兩大類：圖像使用者介面 GUI(Graphic User Interface)
以及實體使用者介面 SUI(Solid User Interface)。對於使用者所接觸的 SUI，其主要在強調實體
產品操作時的標示、按鍵、旋鈕或搖桿等重要性，是否有符合人因設計的要點，尺寸、作業
姿勢、視覺、聽覺或觸覺等等水準。人們大量的使用行動資訊產品，產品之輸入設備仍然沿
用先前傳統的鍵盤。其所定義的按鍵相當多，使得其尺寸無法適當的縮減，也不適用於行動
攜帶，此外雙手在鍵盤上游移的操作方式，更導致手指、手腕及前臂肌肉的傷害(Rose, 1991)。
Baumann與Thomas(2001)也提出，由於現有的資訊產品講求多功能，單鍵對應單功能的
作法已經不太可行了，若要如此使用將使得按鍵佔據大部分面積、製作成本提高，亦增加使
用者負擔，造成操作上錯誤率的提高。手機的控制按鍵設計是影響操作的重要因素，操作時
盡量以自然姿勢操作可避免傷害的造成，操作時能使產品之重心位於掌心，有效改善操作時
之握持姿勢，並增加握持穩定度。
Fitts(1954)定律是一個設計操作按鍵的重要條件，這一關係式被當作為準確度以及速度的
衡量標準(Jagacinski, 1980)。在先前已有不少學者(Card等人, 1983; Drury, 1992; Hoffmann, 1995;
Danion等人, 1999; Sorensen, 2005)在相關領域運用了該定律去探討其影響的結果，種種研究顯
示，此移動的距離將影響鍵入時間之法則是在進行鍵盤設計或是評估時，極具參考價值的一
個定律，尤其是想要針對人因作業效率方面著手進行之案例。
行動性產品的微小化，扮演文字輸入重要角色的鍵盤，越來越不適合用在輸入介面上。
雖然，越來越多的產品採用虛擬化的文字輸入，例如:運用螢幕呈現鍵盤的樣式，讓人用觸控
筆去輸入文字。或將標準鍵盤排列以紅外線投影的方式來輸入文字(Siggraph ,2003)，Rempel
等人認為按鍵設計對鍵盤很重要(Rempel等人, 1997)。因為這些方式不能代替實體按鍵輸入所
帶來的真實感與滿足感。市面上的實體鍵盤包括：外接式鍵盤、嵌入式鍵盤、和弦鍵盤。和
弦鍵盤將按鍵進行整合工作，可使鍵盤上的按鍵數目減少，而能減少手部位移，減輕工作負
荷以及改善作業姿勢，進而降低作業所造成的累積性傷害(Rose, 1991)。
手機在硬體按鍵的設計至今沒有太大的變化。以英文系統來說，為了要將 26 個英文字母
以及標點符號，以 12 個按鍵來輸入，單一鍵具有三、四個字元特性，以多次按壓按鍵或其他
方式來進行選取，如此輸入方式，造成輸入作業效率不佳和手部肌肉骨骼上的負擔。人們希
望手機有更大的畫面來顯示資訊，但是手機的按鍵鍵盤已佔了大部分面積，使螢幕尺寸受限。
若將螢幕變大，手機整體也會變的過大不易攜帶；將按鍵變小，又會造成使用上的不方便。
在資訊產品上，既要增加功能又要減小體積，成為人因學上的疼痛點(Hare, 2002)。因此，本
3測驗。練習時，以電腦程式紀錄練習時間、錯誤數。練習後，再量測一次手指指尖握力值。
測驗時，隨機出現 40 個字元，包括 26 字母、0~9 的數字以及 4 個常用符號。此 40 字元只出
現一次。以電腦程式紀錄練習時間、錯誤數，並用網路攝影機紀錄手指移動的姿勢。最後，
請受測者針對該鍵盤評估主觀滿意度，包括:速度感、學習性、生理感受等心理量。
2.1.3 資料收集與握力測量分析
欲瞭解不同按鍵設計的鍵盤，是否會影響打字速度與指力。故，在練習階段與測驗階段
收集受測者的打字時間、錯誤數、手指指力。打字速度的計算方式為:打字速度=(題目總字數-
錯字數)/打字總時間。手指指力的計算為:四指指力=│練習前的力量-練習後的力量│。為了
解使用者對鍵盤使用的滿意度，故於測驗階段實施後填寫主觀滿意度量表，並進行個別訪談。
本量表要求受測者依學習性、速度、舒適度、整體性對所有鍵盤進行評分，最喜歡到最不喜
歡的等級以 1-10 來評比四種新式鍵盤。根據評分的高低，對受測者進行訪談，以作為未來改
良設計的依據。由測驗階段所得數據，對五鍵盤類型在速度、指力的差異使用 ANOVA 重複
性測量，用 Tukey-Test 作多重比較來了解其顯著性。使用者滿意度的差異則使用 ANOVA 重
複性測量，用 Tukey-Test 評估顯著性。
2.2 手機按鍵設計

型號 三視圖 按鍵配置
三連鍵型
(A2 型)
四角鍵型
(B2 型)
觀察 17 位設計相關科系之大學部學生使用手機姿勢，根據觀察結果設計了八款不同握持
姿勢之手機模型。手機的按鍵位置分別落在手指握持手機之部位，並將按鍵分群，使得五指
得以分工進行輸入，將肌肉負荷分擔至各手指上，此外，依不同手指負荷有所不同，針對小
指及無名指減少其按鍵之負擔。此為參考前人曾提出以自然姿勢來進行操作時的指尖觸及位
置(Eilam, 1989)。請 10 位具有手機使用經驗 3 年以上的人對八支模擬手機評估握持操作姿勢。
將得到最高分之款式做細部設計。根據現有按鍵以及手指分工之設計原則，數字按鍵分佈在
5整體而言，C1型(方型按鍵)學習容易度最低，A1型學習最容易。長條形的鍵盤中，以A1
型學習較容易，方形的鍵盤中，以D型學習較容易。在學習性的同質性檢定上，P值為
0.243>0.05，所以接受虛無假設，4組變異數之間沒有顯著性差異，各組之間的變異數有同質
性，可進行變異數分析。變異數分析之F值為3.746，P=0.016<0.05，拒絕虛無假設。推論不同
的鍵盤設計在學習容易度的評價上有差異。進行事後比較四種鍵盤的學習容易度，從多重比
較表中，只有A1型與C1型有顯著差異，A1型學習容易度的評分較C1型來得高。(表2)

*The mean difference is significant at the .05 level.
平均而言，C1型(四角方形式) 舒服感的評價最低，B1型(分開連鍵式) 舒服感的評價最
高。在舒服感的同質性檢定上，P值為0.561>0.05，所以接受虛無假設，4組變異數之間沒有顯
著性差異，各組之間的變異數有同質性，可進行變異數分析。變異數分析之F值為3.132，
P=0.032<0.05，拒絕虛無假設。可得知不同的鍵盤設計在舒服感的評價上有差異。事後比較四
種鍵盤的舒服感，只有B1型與C1型的舒服感有顯著差異，B1型舒服感評分較C1來得高。
在四種鍵盤的整體評價中，以 B1 鍵盤評分最高。C1 鍵盤的評價最低。在受測者針對使
用四種新式按鍵鍵盤所做的意見陳述中，少數喜歡 A1 鍵盤者(n=4)認為直式按鍵跟標準鍵盤
一樣，可以很容易適應它，單一按鍵的形狀如能夠根據手指移動的方向設計並且根據手指長
短排列，例如:自然手指位置，按鍵會使用更容易。然而，喜歡 A1 鍵盤者在 A1 的速度上沒有
比其他三種鍵盤快。多數喜歡 B1 鍵盤者(n=8)認為字母與數字之間有高低差較佳，三個字母
一組的按鍵可以更容易記憶。惟需要在字母中間有定位點或其他形狀區辨的記號，讓手指在
觸覺上能夠辨識字母的位置。喜歡 1C 鍵盤者(n=1)，認為按鍵再大一點會更易使用。而喜歡
D1 鍵盤者(n=2)，覺得按鍵形狀很容易區別位置，因為有上下左右的方向性，比起 B 鍵盤字
元採水平式的排法，更具有直覺性，而能準確找到字元位置。有受測者指出，四種鍵盤中，
各手指在單一位置上，二手之間的按鍵距離太近導致手肘或肩膀不舒服。訪談中，多數受測
者（n=7）表示 D1 鍵盤較適合應用在商務用手機文字輸入的鍵盤上，方形按鍵可以縮小面積，
很適合小型行動輸入的產品。而 D 型的按鍵具有方向性，容易學習使用的方式。C 鍵盤與 D
鍵盤相比，D1 鍵盤更容易掌握住訣竅。
3.2 和絃手機按鍵設計結果與分析
所有實驗過程中量測了受測者在操作時所花費時間以及錯字數，經由轉換後分別以輸入
7與B2型新手機被歸類為同群組。
平均輸入速率方面，以一般手機為最快，每分鐘可輸入 23.37 個字元，接著是 A2 型新
手機的 18.51 個字元、B2 型新手機 16.78 字元；正確率來說仍然是一般手機領先其他兩支新
型手機，正確率分別為一般手機 98.07%以及 A 型手機 95.8%和 B 型手機 94.8%。以跟現有手
機比較之達成率來說，速率方面，A2 型手機可達到現有手機速率的 79.2%，B2 型可達 71.8%，
而以正確率來說，A2 型可達現有手機正確率的 97.69%，B 型可達到 96.67%。(表 5)
在進行ANOVA分析之前的同質性檢定，英文部分在輸入速率方面與正確率方面P值分別
為0.032與0.157，僅有英文部份的正確率P值大於0.05可進行ANOVA分析。ANOVA分析之後，
在英文部分的作業正確率三隻手機有顯著的差異，P值分別為小於0.001小於0.05，達到顯著性
差異。(表6)
表 6 正式實驗英文部分 ANOVA 分析
平方和 自由度 平均平方和 F檢定 顯著性
正確率 組間 0.011 2 0.006 9.808 0.000*
組內 0.033 57 0.001
總和 0.044 59
在主觀滿意度方面，分為績效評量、生理舒適度與使用性滿意度，分別有七、八以及五道題
目，答題時同時針對單一問題進行三隻手機之比較，並在連續性量表上點出該手機之得分。
量表上並沒有刻畫任何刻度，僅只有原點與終點兩點給予受測者瞭解可勾選之範圍，量表為
一直線段，長度為 10 公分，受測者可在任意位置進行點選，以受測者所勾勒之筆跡與量表接
觸點為得分數值，事後以量尺由起點進行長度量測，所測得之長度為該題之得分，分數由 0
分至 10 分，計算至小數下一位。
在績效與舒適度評量方面，三隻手機的數字部分以及英文部分都沒有通過同質性檢定，
因此沒有辦法進行 ANOVA 分析。滿意度評量方面有通過同質性檢定，數字與英文滿意度的 P
值分別為 0.1 以及 0.133 皆大於 0.05 之標準值，因此可以進行 ANOVA 分析。分析結果顯示，
三隻手機在數字滿意度以及英文滿意度方面皆無達顯著差異，P 值分別為 0.514 與 0.215 大於
0.05。因此使用者對於這三隻手機輸入作業的滿意度是沒有顯著差異的。
4.結論與討論
雖然四種鍵盤的配置設計不影響速度，然而，加入標準鍵盤的速度作單因子變異數分析
時，則 5 種鍵盤在速度上有顯著差異。多重比較其速度平均值，發現標準鍵盤明顯與其他四
款的速度有差異，按鍵的縮小有可能對使用者而言是不同於標準鍵盤的按鍵性質。
指力的測量上，四種鍵盤之間沒有差異。探討其原因，有可能是使用握力器的量測上有
誤差。在實驗設計上曾考慮用其他儀器代替握力器，但又考慮在打字期間讓受測者在手指上
佩帶指力檢測的儀器，會影響速度績效的量測，因此，才以練習前後的握力值當作測量指力。
可惜，運用握力器所得數據不能取到小數點後二位，導致指力差非常微小。未來須在對指力
檢測上作實驗設計上的修正。
在學習容易度上，A1 鍵盤的學習容易度評價最高。主要是因為 A1 型完全符合標準鍵盤
9現有手機的速率來的快，其為 A2 型 87.04 而現有手機為 82.07CPM。此外，在最終次英文單
字的練習部分，A2 型與 B2 型新手機的速率也都是較正式實驗中的現有手機來的快，分別是
A2 型 29.53、B 型 26.9 相較於一般手機的 23.37CPM。而兩款新式手機在練習階段的最後一次
測驗速率也都是較快於正式實驗時的表現。(以上皆以實驗數據平均值計算)
推斷其原因，由於在練習階段之九天的測驗時程是比較緊湊的學習過程，受測者可說是
天天在練習新式手機的操作。然而為了要等待所有受測者完成其練習作業，在練習結束後到
正式實驗中間隔了一段時間，有可能讓部分受測者對於新式手機的操作產生了退步的跡象。
也有可能在正式實驗時因為告知了受測者該次為最終的實驗成果，造成了心理上的緊張，因
此為了怕失誤而變的小心翼翼的操作，也造成了正式實驗時的速率不如練習階段之最終次測
驗的成果。
主觀量表分成數字與英文兩大部分，又針對績效評量、舒適度評量以及滿意度評量分成
六個主題來探討。但是經過 ANOVA 檢定過後發現並沒有顯著性的差異，此一現象可解釋成
受測者在使用不同手機時，無論在進行數字或英文輸入，對於績效、舒適度以及滿意度的主
觀評分並沒有太大的差異。換個角度來說，也就是受測者是可以接受不同輸入裝置來進行輸
入的。觀看原始分數與訪談後得知，現有的手機仍舊是受測者的最愛，儘管在人因學上曾經
提出過諸多理論警告，但受測者對於習慣的設備還是給予最高的滿意度分數。此外，受測者
表示由於固有款式鍵盤配置已經深根於他們大腦中，因此 A2 型手機的配置是較 B2 型手機好
記憶的，不過也有受測者表示，因為 B2 型手機的子按鍵配置非上則下，非左則右，若是能夠
長期學習將其配置牢記之後，他們認為是有可能較現有按鍵以橫排三子按鍵來的優。另一方
面，探究效率與舒適度上就不如一般手機這麼的受歡迎的原因，可能是手機原型的按鍵與現
有產品的差異造成使用者不易使用而影響到結果，此外，由於和弦式的輸入也會造成使用者
在還未充分熟悉時增加他們的心理負擔，但本創新確實解決了傳統鍵盤尺寸問題。

Abstract: As multimedia system is lead into families around the globe, the most natural mode of control is not through any
device but rather the use ofuser’s own body as the tool for interface input. This research began with collecting references
concerning cognition and visual symbols as the principle theory. Through user questionnaires, vocabulary commands of
gesture symbols are selected. Focus Group is further used to formulate the analysis form of gesture symbols. Visual symbol
rules and sign language developments are combined to create new gesture symbols, they are as follows: icon, index and
symbol. Through learning ability, confusion matrix, subjective evaluation and quantification theory type 1, the relations
between factors are evaluated and the most intuitional gestures are gained. These are then labeled as the most appropriate
gesture symbols for common users.
1. INTRODUCTION
Due to the popular use of home audiovisual multimedia, this research is based on the innovative design and evaluation of sign
languages development. References on cognition and visual symbols are collected, through usability questionnaire,
vocabulary command that is suitable for gesture development. Using methods concluded from experts, the research
formulates morphological analysis chart for gesture symbols, this is created with rules of the visual symbols and sign
languages. The gesture symbols includes: icon, index and symbol. This is evaluated though learning, subjective evaluation
and quantification and various analytical methods. This aims to find gesture symbols suitable for users and to provide future
designers a reference for their home audiovisual multimedia.
Due to the development of technology, home audiovisual multimedia has become more dynamic in its mode of control.
In the current study of visual recognition within 3D space, there are: gesture recognition system (Oka & Sato, 2002), facial
expression recognition and its application (Christian & Tombre, 2001). These are al developed from human’s natural 
movements and transforming it to 3D space symbols and symbolical gesture symbols, in the aim of redesigning gesture
symbol language within 3D space. This evaluates the cognition, recognition and reflection of users with gesture symbols
within 3D space and finally, creating suitable gesture symbols within 3D space.
Baxter(1995) mentioned in the book, “Visual cognition” that visual cognition is something one accumulates through 
various experiences in life. Frantz etc. (1991) indicated that sign symbols based on sense and cognition are recognized faster
than texts, therefore sense should be paid with more attention.
The function of sign language can be categorized as the expression of sound, word, form and meaning. Form and
meaning are natural sign languages. Sound and word are grammar sign languages. Natural sign language is expressed mainly
through complex combinations of posture, facial expression, action and gestures. Grammar sign language is a mixture of
colloquial language, grammar and word formation.
2. DESIGN METHOD

image compositing method has been widely used in Augmented Reality applications (Zhang, 1995). This research applies
image compositing technique to emulate different effects of different ties and shirts.
TOPSIS method is a multi-attribute evaluation method provided by Hwang & Yoon (1981). The basic concept of
TOPSIS is defining PIS (positive ideal solution) and NIS (negative ideal solution). PIS is the one that is most beneficial and
the one that costs the least from the proposal; NIS is the one that is least beneficial and the one that costs the most from the
proposal. Selection of the proposal is from the one that is closest to PIS and furthest from NIS. This study uses TOPSIS
approach and applies it to Kansei Engineering, using the operation characteristics of ideal solution and inducts consumer
preferences into the preference ranking of products.
The analytical process of TOPSIS can be divided into the following steps: (1) Formulating decision-making matrix, (2)
Standardizing decision-making matrix, (3) Calculating weighted standardization decision-making matrix, (4) Deciding max
PIS and min NIS, (5) Calculating distance between max PIS and min NIS of each proposal, (6) Calculating similarity of PIS,
(7) Proceed with proposal ranking.
The TOPSIS approach uses “the value closest to max PIS” to formulate the ranking, this avoids obtaining a proposal that
is closest to NIS; and a proposal that is furthest to PIS, which result in the dilemma of not being able to choose a proposal.
2. RESEARCH PROCEDURE
This research uses the TOPSIS approach to study the matching based on the color of shirts and the pattern of ties. The
selection on color parameters is based on focus group method (Beck et al., 1986) to scale down the parameters, in order to find
the representative ties and shirts; patterns of ties are based on the collection of available products and compiling statistics,
eventually gaining quality and parameter of the experiment. This is followed by the synthesis of ties and shirts, thereafter
combining each parameter and undergoes Kansei Engineering experiment. Before the start of the experiment, KJ method is
applied to build a hierarchy between the expected goal of the selected expected image word values and the candidates. This is
followed by descriptive statistics and reliability analysis to understand the correlation of parameters. Finally, using the result
gained from expected image word values evaluation to undergo TOPSIS decision-making analysis and finding the expected
suggestions for consumers. Figure 1 shows the research procedure.
Figure 1. Research Procedure
Color parameters are gained through focus group method. There is one chairman and four group members in the focus
group. Group members have the experience of selling ties for more than five years. Focus group considers sales and fashion
elements of the tie during the selection to gain the final parameter numbers of ties and shirts. In the end, 10 ties and 9 shirts
were obtained (Table 1), creating a 90 types of combination.

3. EXPERIMENT AND TOPSIS APPLICATION
The Kansei-engineering experiment is conducted on 30 Industrial Design students, 28 of them being post-graduates and
the other 2 being undergraduates, all having design background and high sensitivity to colors. They have a good eye sight of
1.0 without any color-blindness. The gender of the candidates is 15 males and 15 females. The average age is 25 years old (the
oldest being 32 and the youngest being 21) with the standard deviation of 2.29. The experiment uses semantic differential
scale and bases the four groups to divide image words into nine groups, which is graded with one to nine points. After
perfoming statistical analysis, points are gained from all the parameter combinations in each of the four groups. These are
then inducted into the TOPSIS matrix, which firstly undergoes reliability analysis in Table 4.The Alpha value is greater than
seven in the chart, meaning that the experiment shows a high reliability.

Abstract: Two-dimensional Image Map is a kind of tool that helps the designer to stimulate the inspiration and catch the idea 
of form design. However, two-dimensional (2D) Image Map cannot present the detail level of topographic correctly and how 
they’ll relate to each other. In recent years, scientist study many kinds of interface forms for adapting to different works. 
Usually, there are two kinds of interface to be presented: the 2D and the three-dimensional (3D) interfaces. Besides the type of 
interfaces, the virtual and physical presentation objects should be considered. Hence, by combining the different types of 
presentation object and interface showed in this research are divided into four kinds Image Maps. In this study, the mobile 
phone is used to be the presentation product. The result shows that according to the answer correctness: 3D tangible interface 
performs best. For reaction time, we found subjects perform fastest in 3D tangible interface. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Every product form design starts with an idea: "I want to design a mobile phone to have a high-tech form," for example. You 
probably want to use a more freeform process to come up with your requirements. But traditional Image Map (A 2D board, 
which has two-dimension, and each dimension represent a pair of Kansei words are the opposite image of the object.) is a kind 
of tool that helps the designer to stimulate the inspiration and catch the idea of form design. However, two-dimensional (2D) 
Image Map cannot present the detail level of topographic correctly and how they’ll relate to each other. In recent years, 
scientist study many kinds of interface forms for adapting to different works. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of 
interface to be presented: the two-dimensional (2D) and the three-dimensional (3D) interfaces. 
Levy’s (1996) research shows that the 3D chart have benefit for showing the detail of data, helping people for long time 
memory, and the 2D chart has benefit for showing the trend of data change, immediately presenting, and reading the data by 
oneself. Cleveland (1984) studies vary kinds of forms, angle, and block, which transmit different information. And the result 
shows that by using 3D depth chart cannot help people for understand 2D information, that is, the subjects must process the 
excess information (1985). About the way to choose 2D, 3D interface, John (2000) proposes that for judging the type of 
object by using 3D interface will perform well, and the relative position of the objects is by using 2D interface. By using 3D 
interface will help subject for judging the level of topographic correctly. So, the benefit of using 2D or 3D interface is related 
to different works. Furthermore, John’s (2001) report discusses the results of two experiments where participants placed 
antenna objects on a terrain map in 3D or 2D. Antenna placement was performed better with a 2D interface than a 3D 
interface. Antenna placement was performed best when participants were provided both a 2D and 3D interface. Therefore, 
both 2D and 3D interfaces presented will enhance user performance during antenna placement. 
Regarding issues related to the type of interfaces, the virtual and physical presentation objects should be considered. The 
virtual interface in this research is based on Augmented Reality (AR), which combines the virtual object in a real world. 
Augmented Reality can enrich a user’s real environment by adding virtual objects to it. The users wear head-mounted 
displays (HMD) with built-in camera which is connected to PC. The tracking technique is based on the ARToolKit marker 
tracking library (Kato, 1999). Augmented reality technology is a powerful tool for designers to visualize the design concept 
and provide an intuitive way for interacting between concepts (Chen, 2004). By combining the different types of presentation 
object and interface showed in this research are divided into four kinds Image Maps, which are 2D tangible interface, 3D 
tangible interface, 2D virtual interface, and 3D virtual interface, as shown in Figure 1.  In this study, the mobile phone is used 
to be the presentation product. The analytical results from four kinds Image Maps provide the most correct interface form 
selection for early design process.

 3. RESULTS 
 
The results of the experiment are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Table 2 shows the correctness rate and the response time. And, 
Table 3 shows the result of two subjective questions in 7-point Likert scale. According to the correctness rate, 3D tangible 
interface performs best; the secondly is 3D virtual interface; all 2D interfaces are the worst, no matter the tangible or virtual 
interface, especially on the 6th question (comparing the difference in height of two cell-phone components), only 2 subjects 
are judged correctly.  
And according to respond time, 3D tangible interface make subjects performs fastest; secondly is 2D tangible interface; 
And the virtual interface let the subjects response slowest. From two subjective questions, subjects think that by using 3D 
tangible interface can more easily judge the figure of the cell-phone than 2D tangible interface; but the subjects think that by 
using 3D virtual interface can not easily judge the figure of the cell-phone through the HMD. However, subjects feel 3D 
interface, no matter the tangible or virtual, can help user to understand the shape of products.

4. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
 
This study investigated the different interfaces for Image Maps. From the experimental result, 3D tangible interface 
demonstrates the best performance in four kind interfaces either at correctness rate and response time because subjects can 
easily receive the shape information of the cell-phone through the physical cell-phone model. In 3D virtual interface has most 
close correctness rate to 3D tangible interface, but 3D virtual interface is reacting for more 1- 2 seconds. This residual 
response time could figure out that the subject get the fully information of the cell-phone shape by 3D virtual interface. And, 
this time can be divided into two parts, a part is an operation time to need of a system, another part is differentiated time by the 
persons who are examined.

Abstract. This article describes experimental investigations of the effects of 
color name displayed and screen layout on customized product color 
combination selection. In the experiment, 6 interface designs were developed by 
systematically varying with 2 factors (interface layout type and color name type) 
in order to explore the relations between the interface of the massive number of 
product color combinations and users’ performance. Results from the experiment 
show the layout type of itemized color chips, which is divided into some items 
according to the customized color module parts of product, has the best grouping 
type for customized product color combination selection in search time by users. 
Besides, users view various color combinations for products directly with or 
without the aid of color names, it gets important whether displayed colors are 
correct or not as users make judgment and choices according to the product 
colors on the screen. 
Keywords: Screen layout, Mass customization, Product color, Color name.  
1   Introduction 
Consumers prefer to choose products from the wide variety of styles that combine 
different colors and forms. Yun et al. (2003) regarded color as a product characteristic 
closely related to consumer impression of a product. Lai et al. (2006) demonstrated that 
the product color has a greater affect on product image than product form. They 
suggested providing consumers with various colors in addition to different product 
forms. Therefore, it is easier to vary product color than form when meeting individual 
consumer preference. Numerous products employ color changes in mass customization 
to create product variations and styles. Currently, many products allow consumers to 
customize color, such as sofas, system furniture, clothing, athletic shoes, cars, 
motorcycles, mobile phone, etc. However, the exhibition area can only show few 
samples and other color combinations can be seen in catalogs or by virtual images 
designed to allow consumers to choose product color via the Internet/Intranet. Kahn 
34 C.-Y. Chen et al. 
and 75HZ refresh rate displayed the experiment stimuli (i.e. the experiment samples of 
interface layouts). All experiment stimuli were shown on the monitor in random order, 
and subjects were asked to perform specific experimental tasks.  
2.2.2   Leather Sofa Deconstruction 
Since most leathered sofas on the market are single-colored or dual-colored, the 
experiment divides a sofa into two module parts – the backrest and the sofa body –for 
purposes of color combination (see Fig. 1).  
Using a focus group method, the five interior designers selected 12 popular colors 
(as shown in Table 1) often used in sofa-related industries. Image compositing 
technique was then applied to two randomly chosen colors to display the color 
combination on the backrest and sofa body, and then 144 (12×12) color combinations 
(including 12 single-colored and 132 dual-colored combinations) of the sofa image 
produced by image compositing technique. Descriptions and procedures with 
regard to image compositing technique can be found in the research conducted 
by Wu et al.(2003, 2004).

2.3   Experimental Design 
In the experiment, the factors affecting the interface design of diverse color selection of 
customized products include color name (with two levels) and arrangement type (with

3   Results and Discussion 
3.1   Analysis of Mean Search Time 
The mean search time spent by each participant and error rate are listed in Table 3. The 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on the mean search time spent seeking 
sofa color combinations. Based on the ANOVA results listed in Table 4, the main effect 
of interface arrangement type significantly influence the mean search time. However, 
color name was found to be insignificant, indicating that there is no obvious difference 
between searching color combinations with or without color name. Table 5 lists the 
mean search time for each factor at different levels.

Regarding the main effect of interface arrangement type, table 5 shows that the mean 
search time for the arrangement type using itemized color chip (B3: 7.58sec) is 
superiorto the arrangement of color chips (B1: 12.05sec) and the arrangement of 
product thumbnails (B2: 12.25sec). The interface arrangement type based on itemized 
color chip (B3) includes 2 groups of single-colored color chips (i.e. the backrest and the 
sofa body) While clicking each one of the two itemized color chips, then the composite 
image of color combination is immediately shown on the screen. In that case, color

Table 7. This result demonstrates that color name type and interface arrangement type 
do not obviously influence error rate.  
3.3   Analysis of User Subjective Satisfaction  
When each subject has completes an assigned interface task, they must complete a 
questionnaire for that interface. The questionnaire includes items dealing with ease of 
use, ease of discrimination of product colors and preference, to which the subjects 
select sofa colors with the 6 interfaces. Table 8 lists the mean satisfaction degrees.  
Regarding arrangement types, two items are clearly significant in operating the 6 
interfaces (as listed in Table 9):  1.ease of use, 2.preference. From the mean of 
subjective satisfaction listed in Table 8: The mean of itemized color chips (B3: easy of 
use, 4.42; preference, 4.45) exceed those of color chips (B1: ease of use, 3.42; 
preference, 3.78) and product thumbnails (B2: ease of use, 3.65; preference, 3.58); 
consequently, the layout of itemized color chips (B3) is clearly superior. Users consider 
the arrangement type of itemized color chips to be easier to use, and thus prefer it, 
because in the color combinations involved in multi-colored sofas, an interface 
structured around two groups (each group involves the 12 colors) of color chips, for 
backrests and sofa bodies, is less confusing and easier to search. On the contrary, there 
are 144 color combinations in the arrangement type of color chips and product 
thumbnails. Consequently, numerous combinations appearing on the screen 
simultaneously create an impression of difficulty of use.

2   Method 
Input devices are being classified into two categories, pointing and text input. Most 
studies in the past focused only on the efficiency or design of keyboard input; there 
are hardly any complete evaluations on the integration of input device research. This 
study will include pointing device and keyboard input research and undergo different 
combinations of chord grouping with touch pens in various experiments. These 
experiment results are being compared with the available keyboards and mouse to 
obtain the best input device design. 
2.1   Research of Existing Keyboard and Mouse Input 
Keyboard and mouse are the most common input devices used nowadays; most 
computer users have accepted and became accustomed to this combination. But this 
combination is not the best selection for input gesture and efficiency. Due to the 
development of icons on computer user interface, a mouse is used much more often 
than a keyboard. The development of the internet has also resulted in the frequent use 
of a mouse. This experiment makes use of a mouse and keyboard for the purpose of 
comparison; based on its common usage and the problem that arises from its usage. 
The experiment will start by testing a mouse and keyboard, it will act as a procedure 
to adjust to the experiment and furthermore to act as a standard of comparison for the 
new input combination.   
2.2   Formulating Combination of Touch Pen and Chord Keyboard 
In the vast amount of input devices, this research focuses on the future of mobile 
products. It puts into consideration various new types of input combination based on 
gestures and input efficiency, with the goal of providing the best combination for 
input devices. The pointing device we have chosen is a touch pen; this is based on 
the fact that human’s reliability on the usage of pens has not decreased due to 
technological development [5]. This experiment uses a touch pen merely as a simple 
pointing device. It hopes to reach the input efficiency of a mouse and avoid the 
physical harm caused by the usage of a mouse. In terms of text inputs, a chord 
keyboard is considered due to its size and input efficiency. Due to the lack of usage 
in academic studies, learning curve of the input device will be an element of this 
study. This study hopes that the chord keyboard which has been seen as a special 
input device will be recognized for common usage; promoting common usage of the 
device. 
2.3   Selection of Chord Keyboard Grouping 
This experiment requires the collocation of chord keyboard and touch pen; based on 
their individual characteristics and arrangement, “Single-hand control” and “text-
number input” is chosen. Product reliability, popularity and developmental stage are 
also placed under consideration. The following three sets of keyboard are used as 
experiment variables:  
 Improvements of Chord Input Devices for Mobile Computer Users 1029 
has a ordering similar to existing mobile phones. These three keyboards are all paired 
with touch pen. A QWERTY keyboard is paired with a mouse that acts as a pointing 
device for the task. 
b. Dependant variable:  
(a) Input rate: CPM, characters per minute. 
(b) Error rate: the number of errors typed per hundred words. 
(c) Operating gesture: the elbow, wrist and upper body gesture. 
(d) The record of wrist deflection angle. 
(e) Objectivity chart: comfort of the shoulder and wrist and the learning curve.  
2.4.2   Subjects 
15 voluntary subjects (7 females and 8 males), the subjects have over three years of 
keyboard, mouse input and mobile text message input experience. Their ability of 
typing words per minute is between 20 to 30 words per minute. All the subjects are 
right-handed.  
2.4.3   Experiment Equipment 
Three sets of chord keyboard including BAT chord keyboard, Half chord keyboard, 
NEW chord keyboard, QWERTY keyboard; a touch pen, tablet computer, mouse and 
digital camera; 0.5mm black tape and transparent tapes for wrist deflection 
adjustment. 
2.4.4   Experiment Task 
The experiment task consists mainly of pointing and text input. The pointing task 
includes clicking and dragging; clicking refers to the clicking of buttons. “Begin task” 
and “complete task” buttons are clicked accordingly. Dragging is designed to 
dragging computer icons on a user interface. Text input tasks require the subjects to 
enter the assigned alphabet; when an error is made, the subject is asked to delete the 
mistake and enter the correct text.  
The experiment enters the instruction page, after reading the instructions the task 
of pointing and text inputting is proceeded. The experiment begins by clicking on the 
start button and enters the dragging task screen where the subject has to drag the 
image into a block. Next page can be accessed by clicking on the link where the task 
of English text input begins. One hundred texts are entered according to the screen 
display, the font size is 14, and the text contents are simple extracts from the 
children’s fable “The Little Prince”. The alphabet contents are distributed normally to 
avoid rare texts and display common input texts. The two tasks are criss-crossed and 
the pointing and text inputting tasks are being executed five times.  
2.4.5   Experiment Procedure 
a. Phase one: In order to understand the learning curve and operating gesture, phase 
one is preceded in five days, each procedure undergoes 30-40 minutes. A practice 
session of 10 minutes is proceeded before entering the actual program. 15 subjects are 
divided equally between BAT chord keyboard, Half chord keyboard and NEW chord 
keyboard. All three groups are collocated with a touch pen. The experiment 
instructions and settings are introduced on the first day where existing keyboard and

3.1.2   Phase One Input Rate and ANOVA 
In order to understand the differentiation of the input rate from the various groups 
after phase one of the experiment, Scheffe’s test is applied to investigate the relation 
of various group input rates on day five. According to Table2, the salience of BAT 
and Half is 0.002, and the salience of BAT and NEW is 0.015, using Scheffe’s 
method. Both results are smaller than the level of significance of 0.05. The salience of 
Half and NEW is 0.467, higher than the level of significance of 0.05. This indicates 
that there is a significant difference between the input rate of Half and BAT, and 
NEW and BAT. There is no significant differences with the combination of Half and 
NEW. Furthermore, according to Table3, Scheffe’s method groups together Half and 
NEW and isolates BAT.

more difficult to use initially, the other two keyboards uses existing keyboard 
grouping which lowered the input error rate. 
In order to investigate the error rates of each group, the error rate and the various 
groups of phase one undergoes One-Way ANOVA. The test of homogeneity of 
variance salience is higher than the level of significance which is 0.05. This shows 
that the variance of various groups are the same, and the error rate variance of each 
group can be analyzed. After five days of training, according to Table5, error rates of 
all three sets of chord keyboard decreased accordingly and they are not far from the 
error rate of normal keyboard (1.0%-1.4%). This shows that after a short period of 
practice, the input error rate can be adjusted to the levels of a normal keyboard. 
Overall, NEW keyboard have kept the error rate minimal and at a steady decease. 
This shows that a grouping that is similar to the groupings of a mobile phone will 
lower the error rate of the subject.  
3.2   Phase Two Experiment Result and Analysis 
After a week of experiment training is stopped, phase two of the training experiment 
is continued which consists of duration of two days. A Paired Samples T Test is done 
on the three new sets of chord keyboards and touch pen. After stopping a week from 
the training, the salience is 0.01 which reaches salience from day five of phase one 
and day one of phase two. This indicates that there is a remarkable degeneracy in the 
input rate. But compared with the second day which had a salience of 0.262 showing 
no noticeable change. This indicates that the subject could recall the new form of 
input and there are no significant differences to the learning of chord keyboard during 
phase one. 
In order to investigate the relation of the input rate of various groups, the input rate 
and groups undergoes One-Way ANOVA. After the test of homogeneity, the level of 
significance is set at 0.05. The input rate of day one undergoes square transformation 
to conform to the test of homogeneity, so they can undergo variance analysis. After 
the training stops for a week, on day one of phase two, BAT keyboard’s input rate is 
24.98cpm, Half keyboard’s input rate is 41.33cpm and NEW keyboard’s input rate is 
42.55cpm. There is a decline in the input rate of the three set of keyboards. BAT 
keyboard showed that after a period of learning, the memorization for the grouping 
decreases and therefore slows down the input rate. The other two groups makes an 
alteration to existing input method which helps with the memorization of the 
keyboard formation. Therefore, the input rate will not decline after a week of not 
using the keyboard.  
The second day of phase two, the input rates of all three sets increased. BAT and 
Half is close to the input rate of day five from phase one. NEW has even improved by 
7.48cpm, indicating that after a short period of practice, the grouping of chord 
keyboard can be memorized and recovered to the previous standard. NEW keyboard 
did not have a decline and furthermore rapidly grow, surpassing Half keyboard to 
become the most fast input rate of the three groups. Memorization of this phase had 
the best evaluation. Therefore this keyboard is chosen as the candidate for the next 
phase to seek combination with the most efficient input rate.
