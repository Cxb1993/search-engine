Abstract 
In this research project, we consider a retailer chain with a single distribution center dealing with a single 
type of seasonal product.  Inventory of the product is stored in the retailers and the distribution center to 
satisfy the uncertain and price-sensitive demands of the product in a finite planning horizon.  The permanent 
markdown pricing method is adopted by the retail chain.  The decisions are the exact pricing strategy across 
periods and the inventory replenishment of the retailers from the distribution center so as to maximize the 
overall profit of the retailer chain.  The optimal decisions for small-size problems can be found by dynamic 
programming.  By making use of the concavity of the objective function in adding items to retailers, several 
iterative heuristics using average demand in each period are developed to approximate the optimal decisions 
for large-size problems. This report describes the design of several heuristic variants and demonstrates the 
computational results. The results show the effectiveness of the developed heuristics.

1. Introduction 
Retailers mark down the sale prices for promotion or clearance.  The former is a usually held temporary for a 
specific period, with price raised back to normal off the period.  The policy is often a means to attract 
customers to create the demand, especially when over-stocked.  The later is a standard procedure for 
fashionable or perishable products with life time defined by trend, nature, or technology; see the price changes 
of apparel in a retailer outlet across a season, of fresh sea food in a wet market in a day, or canned food in a 
supermarket towards its shelf time.  Such price markdowns are routine, recurrent, and generally planned 
ahead to maximize the profit from a product.  It is precisely this type of price markdown that we study in this 
paper.   
As demonstrated by Lazear (1986), markdown down pricing appears naturally when a retailer only know 
the distribution of reservation value of a product, a term used in later works to denote the valuation of the 
product by customers.  With simple models Lazear shows that the expected revenue of the retailer increases 
with chances to reduce the price of the product to attract otherwise unresponsive customers.  In practice, 
markdown pricing has long history; e.g., Pashigian (1988) traces the variation of markdown pricing of US 
department stores from 1925-1984.  Among others, two striking observations are that the markdowns as a 
percentage of sales has been increasing from after World War II to 80’s, and that there are empirical evidence 
showing more markdowns with fashionable products.  These results are further confirmed by Pashigian and 
Bowen (1991).  For the current trend, a good rule-of-thumb indicator for the markdown may be 10% as 
shown in a representative example in Fung, Fung, and Wind (2008).  It does not need to read the statistics 
such as the 2006 total revenue of US$ 1, 252.8 billion in global apparel industry (fashionproducts.com (2010)) 
customers are willing to pay, it can be very difficult to know the exact customer arrival rate. 
 
3. Methodology 
In this section, we first present a dynamic programming formulation to solve the problem exactly. Due to the 
computational complexity of DP, we design several heuristics to tackle the underlying problem. 
 
3.1 Dynamic Programming Formulation 
 In the following, the subscript j is associated with retailers, i.e., j changes from 1 to J.  The subscript k is 
associated with periods, i.e., k changes from K to 1 as time advances forward in the convention of backward 
dynamic programming.  For the dynamic programming (DP) formulation, let: 
 
 hj be the inventory holding cost per piece per unit, where j = 0 is for the DC and 1 ≤ j ≤ J are for the 
retailers;   
 fj be the fixed shipment cost;   
 cj be the variable shipment cost;   
 sj be the penalty cost per piece of loss sales for retailer j;        
pjk be the price of retailer j in period k;     
yjk be the amount ordered by retailer j in period k, and  
I0k be the inventory of the distribution center at (the beginning of) period k.   
 
The inventory cost of the distribution center at period k = h0k(I0k - Σj yjk);   
 the shipping costs of the distribution center at period k =     ∑ >

 the penalty cost of retailer j in period k = sjE[Djk – (Ijk+yjk)]+;  
 the revenue of retailer j in period k = pjkE[min(Djk, Ijk+yjk)].   
 
At any period k, let Ik = (Ijk) be the inventory vector of and pk be the price vector adopted by all retailers;  
Vk(pk+1, pk, Ik) be the maximum revenue from period k to period 1 if pk+1 and pk  are chosen at periods k+1 
and k, respectively, and the inventory status of period k is Ik.

Let Vk(pk+1, Ik) be the maximum revenue from period k to period 1 if pk+1 is chosen at period k+1 and the

heuristics) iterate repeatedly till the optimal price vector and the optimal allocation converge.  At the end of 
one phase before convergence, there are also specific rules to convert the results of the phase just completed 
to the parameter values of the next phase from.  Refer to Section II.? for the initialization rules and the 
conversion rules of the heuristics.       
 
3.2.1 The PMD Heuristic: Prices from Mean Demands  
 
The PMD heuristic estimates the optimal values of the price vector (pjK, …, pj1) for retailer j for a given 
allocation A of inventory to the retailer.  The procedure to deduce the exact value of Ajk is documented in 
Section 4.  Here, given A and approximating the actual demand of price pjk by its mean demand djK(pjK), we 
deduce expressions to estimate the various monetary terms.  The estimated revenue in period K for retailer j 
is  
 
pjK min (AjK, djK(pjK)),  
 
and the inventory at the beginning of period K-1 is  
 
Aj,K-1 = [Aj,K -djK(pjK)]+.   
 
In general, the total revenue (without considering any cost) for retailer j in the planning horizon is 
 
 vj =  where Aj,k-1 = [Ajk-djk(pjk)]+. (5) ,))(,min(

 The estimated shortage cost = s max( jd - AjK, 0);   (6)

To estimate the inventory cost, we note that at the beginning of period K, IjK pieces of inventory are in retailer 
j and another AjK - IjK are in the DC for retailer j.  Let kI be the first period that demand at retailer j is satisfied 
by inventory in DC, i.e.,  and   Then for periods K to kI+1, the 
inventory levels at the beginning of a period for retailer j is given by

 3.1° For the first to the N(M, K)th price vector {

 } 
}      
 
As the output, Algorithm 1 gives the best price vector for each retailer across the K periods.   
 
 Algorithm 1 applies no matter the retailers have the same price option or not.  If there is the additional 
constraint that all retailers must have the same price in a period, we simply add up all the estimated profit of 
retailers in a period and the price vector that maximizes these sums of all retailers in the K periods.   
 
3.2.2 The IPV Heuristic: Inventory from Price Vectors  
 
 The PMD heuristic suggests good price vector pj for a given allocation of inventory.  The IPV heuristic 
determines the allocation of inventory for the retailers across the K periods and hence gives the executable 
inventory transfer decisions from the DC to retailers, if any, for period K.  It estimates various monetary 
terms in a fashion similar but different from the PMD heuristic.  To prepare for the IPV heuristic, consider 
the functions gj(⋅) and Gj(⋅) for retailer j for the given price vector pj, where gj(⋅) and Gj(⋅) are the functions for 
the initial inventory at retailer j and at the DC for retailer j, respectively.

Note that in gj(⋅) we have dropped the fixed transfer cost fj as well as certainly inventory costs.  Their effects 
will be considered after establishing the concavity of gj(⋅).   
 
 
Lemma 1. The function gj(y) and Gj(y) are concave for all j.   
 
Proof.  We establish the result for gj(y).  The case of Gj(y) is established in the similar fashion.   
 
 It is simple to check that for fixed d the function min(d, y) is concave for y and [y-d]+ and [d-y]+ are 
convex.  Taking expectation when replacing d by the random variable Djk preserves these properties.  The 
result follows by noting that the expression subtract E[y-Djk]+ and [Djk-y]+   

j in period k.    
3° // Allocation of the Initial inventory of the Distribution Center I0K 
 Allocate the initial inventory I0K of the DC one by one to the periods of all retailers according to the 
maximum marginal expected profit, as long as the value is positive.  At any generic step, the marginal 
expected return of retailer j in period k is Gjk(ajk+1)-Gjk(ajk)-(K-k)h0, where Gjk(⋅) = Gj(⋅) for each k, and 
(K-k)h0 is to account for the difference in inventory cost to store an item across different periods.     
4° // Adjustment of Inventory Allocation for the Fixed Transfer Cost 
 Now check the total profit of the inventory allocated to a retailer in a period.  Cancel any allocation 
made in 3° in a period for a retailer if the profit is less than the fixed shipment cost. Re-allocate all 
cancelled item in the fashion of 3° as long as the expected marginal profit is positive. 
 
At the end of Algorithm 2, let ajk be the final amount of inventory allocated to retailer j in period k.  Among 
these, let bjk be allocated from the initial inventory of DC, where the value of bjk is determined by during the 
execution of Algorithm 2.  Note that it is possible that bjk = 0.        
 
 The estimated total profit of retailer j in period k  
= gjk(ajk-bjk) - gjk(0) + Gjk(bjk) - Gjk(0);   (15)

Note that (15) and (16) are not the exact total profit.  They miss the fixed transportation cost, and in (13a) 
and (13b), the mean demands there are imprecise estimates of the sales revenue.   
 
3.2.3 The Determination of A 
 
The PMD heuristic needs A to start.  At the very first iteration, we simply set the get the average 
demand of the highest price for all retailers in all periods.  In particular, if  for all j, set

3° The IPV-PMD Heuristic: Now we have the PMD heuristic that determines the price vectors for the given 
inventory allocation and the IPV heuristic that determines the inventory allocation for given price vectors.  
We iterate on these two heuristics to determine the decisions on price and inventory allocation of the 
system. 
4° Variations of IPV-PMD: Several other heuristics such as IPV-II and IPV-III, are designed to improve 
IPV-PMD.  
 
4. Computational Results 
The computational experiments are conducted in a computer with Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600, 2.4 GHz 
and 1.98 GB of RAM. Several experiments (Experiments 1 to 5) are done to evaluate the performance of the 
heuristics. A couple of experiments are also done in order to get some more insight of the problem by using 
our proposed heuristics. 
 
Comparison of Heuristics and DP 
¾ Experiment 1: One-retailer with different number of periods 
¾ Experiment 2: Multiple-retailers with different number of periods 
¾ Experiment 3: Three-period-two-retailer with different numbers of DC inventory 
¾ Experiment 4: Three-period-two-retailer with different inventory allocation 
¾ Experiment 5: Two-period-three-retailer with different inventory allocation  
¾ Experiment 6: The impact on ordering in the first period by the number of decision periods 
¾ Experiment 7: The structure of price and mean demand 
 
Three heuristics are tested including IPV-PMD (with three different variants depending on their initial prices: 
H2, P-Max and P-Min), IPV-II, and IPV-III. The average profits of each of these three methods are obtained 
using a simulation of 1,000 replications that attain desired accuracy. The gap between the DP profit and the 
heuristic profit is calculated if the DP result is available. Several experiments are designed to test the 
performance of the proposed heuristics. The comparison also includes DP when the results of it are available. 
 
Experiment 1: One-retailer with different number of periods 
In this set of instances, the size of the DC inventory is fixed while the number of decision periods is varied. 
The arrival rate is adjusted to match the number of periods in the corresponding instance. When there is only 
one period, the arrival rate is λ. If there are K periods (in the order of K, K-1,…,1) then the sum of arrival 
rates of these K periods equals λ. That is λK+λK-1+…+λ1=λ. Furthermore, the arrival rate is assumed to 
decrease over time if the price is not changed. The price menu is assumed to be fixed for each period. The 
pricing strategy is assumed to be monotone non-increasing. The arrival rates relationship between two 
consecutive periods can be described as follows: 
λk-1 = ηk λk, 
 12
KWithout loss of generality, let ηk = η for all {1, , }k ∈ … , then λk = ηK-kλK for all . {1, , }k K∈ …
 
Table 2 shows the settings of 1-retailer instances. Note the notation of “PiRj” represents the class of problem 
The setting of the arrival rate of one-retailer can be illustrated in Table 3 (initial DC inventory = 160, retailer 
initial inventory = 0)

Table 4 compares the resulting profit for one retailer with different numbers of periods. Table 5 and Figure 1 
demonstrate the gap between each of the heuristics and the DP algorithm. In average, IPV-II achieves the best 
performance. IPV-III performs well except for the P5R1_1 instance.

Experiment 7: The structure of price and mean demand 
This experiment investigates the relationship between the price and mean demand. In the previous 
experiments, it is assumed the mean demand changes based on the price in the price menu. Suppose the price 
menu consists of q different prices p1, p2, …, pq, where p1>p2>…> pq. The mean demand when price equals to 
pi is di where 1≦i≦q.  
i q
id d
q
=  
For example, if there are four prices in the price menu including $30, $24, $18 and $12, then the mean 
demands would be 0.25d4, 0.5d4, 0.75d4, and d4, respectively. The products of price and mean demand in this 
case are 7.5d4, 12d4, 13.5d4, and 12d4, respectively. In a myopic point of view, setting the price as $18 would 
maximize the profit. One way of letting the products equal in this case, is to change the price menu to be {$30, 
$15, $10, $7.5}. This design is certainly legitimate theoretically, but the first discounted price (the second 
price) is relatively small in comparison to the full price. This may be different from what is observed in

As mentioned in the third observation, it is interesting to find out whether changing the DC inventory will 
affects the pricing and order policy.  
 
Conclusions 
In this project, a dynamic programming model is set up for a fashion-product retailer chain to determine 
the pricing strategy and ordering policy (from the distribution center). Several heuristics have been designed 
and implemented. The results of several experiments are shown in this report. The results show the strength of 
our developed heuristics, which can help to make pricing and order decision much quicker in a very accurate 
way.

In this project, we have successfully modeled the problem using dynamic programming, and 
designed several heuristics to solve the retailer-chain markdown pricing problem. The problem is 
more complex than we thought but we managed to encounter the difficulties and developed good 
tools. In comparison to the dynamic programming algorithm, our proposed heuristics are able to 
deliver reasonable good results in a fraction of time.

 Paper abstract 
In this paper, we consider a retailer chain with a single distribution center dealing with a single 
type of seasonal commodity.  Inventory of the commodity is stored in the retailers and the 
distribution center to satisfy the uncertain and price-sensitive demands of the commodity in a 
finite planning horizon.  The permanent markdown pricing method is adopted by the retail 
chain.  The decisions are the exact pricing strategy across periods and the inventory 
replenishment of the retailers from the distribution center so as to maximize the overall profit 
of the retailer chain.  The optimal decisions for small-size problems can be found by dynamic 
programming.  By making use of the concavity of the objective function in adding items to 
retailers, several iterative heuristics using average demand in each period are developed to 
approximate the optimal decisions for large-size problems.

I attended the 21st Annual POMS Conference held in Vancouver from May 7th to 10th 2010. 
The conference theme is “operations in emerging economics”. In particular, critical global 
issues like supply chain sustainability and health care are highlighted in this conference. This 
conference was taking place at Vancouver downtown. This conference was organized by the 
Production and Operations Management Society (POMS). This conference provided the 
international research community in POM and SCM an opportunity to get together, present 
research results, and exchange ideas. On Saturday, May 8th, Prof. Wan and I presented our 
paper entitled “Markdown Pricing of Seasonal Products in Retail Chains”. We exchanged ideas 
with the audience after the presentations. It was a great presentation. On the other hand, the
