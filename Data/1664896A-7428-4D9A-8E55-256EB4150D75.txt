ABSTRACT. Covalently cross-linked non-
ﬂuorinated hydrocarbon ionomers are synthesized
by introducing sulfonate groups and a siloxane
cross-linker through thermally and chemically stable
imide bonding on Poly- (styrene-co-maleic
anhydride). The three- dimensional polysiloxane
framework, which does not only act as a robust
scaffold but also provide sites for the hydrogen
bonding with water, contribute to the increase in
bound water degree, higher proton conductivity at
lower ion exchange capacity, and greatly decreased
methanol permeability. The spherical-shaped ionic
clusters produce a comparable proton conductivity
(10−1 S cm−1 above 60 ◦C) to Naﬁon-117. The
conductivity of the hybrid ionomer does not
decrease to gain its selectivity, but instead increased.
Methanol permeability is ∼70% lower than that of
Naﬁon-117, but has a higher water uptake and IEC.
The membrane with IEC values of 1.1 mequiv. g−1
exhibits a constant conductivity for 200 h in
hydrolytic stability test, and produce a power density
20% higher than Naﬁon-117 in single DMFC
operation.

Introduction
Fuel cels are clean and efﬁcient electrochemical 
power source that generate electric power via
chemical reaction of fuels and oxygen and therefore
have received a great deal of attention as potential
high energy density power supplies [1–4].
Perﬂuorinatedionomers (Naﬁon®, du Pont) has long 
been the standard polymer for use in proton
exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) [5,6]. The main
purpose for the electrolyte is to allow protons to pass
through freely while being a barrier to electrons and
reactants. The perﬂuorinated ionomers arehighly
proton conductive upon hydration with water and
chemically and physically stable at a temperature
lower than 100 ◦C, however, fail as a barrier to
methanol solutions. High methanol permeability,
high cost, and environmental concerns of the
ﬂuorinated materials are also serious drawbacks for
the practical application of this type of fuel cell
applications [7].
Alternatively, there has been interest in
developing nonﬂuorinated ionomers having
the capacity to conduct protons. Engineering
thermal plastics, acid-doped polymers, and solid
acids with superprotonic phase transitions all fall
within this category [8–10]. As has been recently
reviewed, interest in such materials has led to the
development of blending nonﬂuorinated ionomers
with inorganic ﬁlers, such as SiO2 and nanoclay,
as well as inorganic acids and superprotonic oxides
[11]. The blending technique, which is appearing to
be an extremely promising chemical modiﬁcation
4ratio of AESA-Na and APTES (the repeat unit of
AESA-Na, x = 0.077, 0.199, 0.234, 0.313 for
membranes A, B, C, D, respectively).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of the Hybrid
Ionomer
The imidation of poly(maleic anhydride-co-
styrene) with 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid sodium
salt (AESA-Na) and aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) proceeded quantitatively in DMSO to give
the title ionomers (Scheme 1). A series of hybrid
ionomers A-D with different side chain sulfonate
groups (x) and APTES (1-x) were synthesized. The
side chain composition was set at x = 0.077 –0.313
by moles to obtain the ionomers with titrated
ion-exchange capacity (IEC) ranging from 0.28 to
1.10 mequiv g-1 (Table 1). The molar ratio of
siloxane to sulfonate group (= (1-x)/x) represented
the cross-linking degree in the membrane. Casting
from DMSO solution of the ionomers gave a tough
and flexible brown membrane with a thickness of
200 m following a thermal imidation process at
200 oC under vacuum. The ionomers after thermal
imidation would not dissolved in any polar aprotic
solvent. These membranes were characterized by
FT-IR, solid-state 13C and 29Si CP/MAS NMR.
The FTIR spectra in the 800 –2000 cm-1 region
of the hybrid membranes and the raw poly are
shown in Figure 1. For poly(maleic anhydride-co-
styrene), two absorption bands, at 1780 and 1857
cm-1, show the valence oscillation of the cyclic
anhydride structure. For the hybrid ionomers, the
characteristic absorption bands at 1702, 1775 and
1342 cm-1, being ascribed to symmetric and
asymmetric imide carbonyl groups and the C-N-C
absorption of the imide ring, [26] respectively, with
the absence of the cyclic anhydride peaks
demonstrated the formation of imide structure and
the success of the side chain reaction. The first
noticeable difference among these membranes is the
sharpening of the peaks at around 1042 and 1215
cm-1 which are assigned respectively to the –SO3-
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations. [27]
A progression in the relative intensity of these two
bands toward a higher absorbance indicated an
increasing concentration of a sulfonate group for
membranes A to D.
Figure 2 shows the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of
the membranes with different concentration of
sulfonate groups on side chain. The two peaks at=
10 and 23 ppm are assigned to the methylene
carbons in the α and β positions of the silicon atom, 
respectively. A broad signal, which ranged from 30
to 60 ppm, is composed of three superimposed peaks:
the methylene carbon in the and positions at 36
and 52 ppm of the sulfonate group on the pendent
AESA chain, and the methylene carbon on polymer
backbone at = 42 ppm. The other downfield peaks
at = 128 and 180 ppm are ascribed to the aromatic
carbon atom and carbonyl carbon of imide ring. [28]
Solid-state 29Si NMR measurements were
performed to gain further information regarding the
structure of the inorganic side and to provide further
information about the levels of condensation and the
structure of the inorganic network of the hybrid
materials. Figure 3 shows the 29Si CP/MAS NMR
spectra of the samples which were prepared with
different sulfonate contents, together with
assignment to each T1-, T2- and T3-group of silicon.
These signals are attributed to condensed siloxane
fragments in T3 [RSi(OSi)3] at = 65 ppm, T2
[RSi(OR)(OSi)2] at  = 55 ppm and T1
[RSi(OR)2(OSi)] at  = 47 ppm arrangements,
respectively. [29,30] The intensity of the T3
resonance is found to be much higher than that of T2
and T1 in all samples, indicating a predominating
degree of the three-dimensional silsesquioxane
network in the hybrid membranes.
The aforementioned hybrid ionomers were
subjected to differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
measurements to evaluate their thermal
characteristics. The DSC thermograms of the
6divided by IEC values, as shown in Table 3. It has
been known that the number of water molecules per
sulfonic acid group correlates closely with the size
of ionic clusters in ionomers. [33] Figure 4 displays
the dependence off andb on cross-linking density.
The reduced concentration of sulfonic acid groups,
as well as the cross-linked siloxane framework
occupying the space for free water, brought about
the decreasing curve for f. Furthermore, the
similarity between the two curves of b and t
suggested that bound water dominates the behavior
of water adsorption in the hybrid membranes. The
V-shaped curves of b and t are referred to as a
compromise between the sulfonic group and
siloxane matrix. At low cross-linking degrees (=
2~4), the decrease in b followed with the decrease
in IEC values. At = 12, sulfonic acid groups were
confined in the robust polysiloxane network, and
were expected to be incapable of binding with
numerous water molecules; however, increasing
siloxane segments encouraged a strong interaction
between water and the well-established polysiloxane
framework by hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, this
bonding led to an increase in b. The specific
interaction between water and the cross-linked
polysiloxane network was characterized by the
lower Tm2, which appeared in DSC thermograms as
reported previously. [24] In Table 3, the membrane
A, B and C showed bound water degrees being
higher than 85%. The bound water degree of
membrane D is 78%, but even then it is still higher
than Nafion-117 (60%). These results suggest
significant phase-separated microstructures, as
discussed below together with the results of TEM
analyses.
Proton Conductivity
The proton transfer behavior through the
cross-linked hybrid membranes is envisaged as
being essentially affected by the temperature, water
uptake, IEC values and the cross-linking degree. The
in-plane proton conductivity () of the fully
hydrated hybrid membranes (100% R.H.) is plotted
as a function of temperature, as shown in Figure 5a.
The dependence of proton conductivity on
temperature showed an Arrhenius relationship for all
membranes. The conductivity at 30 oC, as shown in
Table 2, increased as the IEC increased. The D
membrane showed the most preferable conductivity
of 5.7×10-2 S cm-1 at 30 oC, which is comparable to
Nafion-117, and increased with rising temperatures
to the order of 10-1 S cm-1 above 60 oC. Moreover,
the slope in Figure 5a is similar for the hybrid
ionomers and Nafion-117, suggesting that these
membranes have the same proton transfer kinetics
involving Grotthus-type conduction. The
conductivity measurement was carried out at 60 oC
and 100% RH on a longer time scale (Figure 5b).
The D membrane showed a drop in proton
conductivity within 20 h, but then kept a constant
conductivity value of 0.06 S cm-1 within acceptable
error for 200 h, which confirms satisfactory
hydrolytic stability.
The effect of the cross-linking degree on water
uptake behavior and proton conductivity of the
hybrid membranes is illustrated in Figure 6.
Apparently, this system showed a decrease both in
conductivity and water uptake with an increasing
cross-linking degree. A similar trend was observed
for water uptake and conductivity in that a lower
cross-linking degree (α < 4) results in a greater slope 
than the higher α. This trend is related to the 
transition between the water bound with –SO3H and
the one associated with the polysiloxane framework.
Here, the water bound with the polysiloxane
framework played an important role in proton
conductivity in the highly cross-linked membrane.
Since the IEC at high cross-linking degree was
rather low, the main contribution in proton
conductivity would be from the bound water
retained around the siloxane segment rather than
from the water surrounding with sulfonic acid
groups, as discussed in the water state section. This
8are larger than those of membrane B, and therefore,
favors faster proton transportation. Furthermore, the
poor connectivity between the spherical-shaped
ionic clusters could be the reason for the attainment
of the low methanol permeability. We suggest that
the diffusion of the large complex formed by
methanol and water is likely obstructed by the
cross-linked polysiloxane network between the
spherical ionic clusters; thus resulting in the high
selectivity, as mentioned previously.
Single DMFC Performance
The performance of the membrane electrode
assemblies (MEAs) in the DMFC with membrane D
and Nafion-117 as electrolyte membranes, E-TEK
20% Pt/XC-72 as cathode, and E-TEK 20%
PtRu/XC-72 as anode, were evaluated in a single
DMFC. The electrolyte membrane was sandwiched
between the cathode and the anode by hot pressing.
Membrane D exhibited a higher current density than
Nafion-117 by 19 mA cm-2 in the ohmic resistance
region (0.29 V), as shown in the polarization curves
of Figure 9a. The corresponding power density
curves of these MEAs are also displayed in Figure
9b. Membrane D showed a good power density of
25.0 mW cm-2, which is better than that of
Nafion-117.
Conclusion
Proton conducting hydrocarbon ionomers,
manifested as sulfonated poly(maleic
imide-co-styrene), were synthesized. Covalently
cross-linked polysiloxane/poly(maleic
imide-co-styrene) hybrid membranes showed good
proton conductivities comparable to Nafion. The
methanol permeating behavior was found to depend
on the cross-linking degree and the hydrogen
bonding between water molecules and the
polysiloxane networks. The state of water, as
indicated by thermal transitions, can be directly
connected to the resulting properties of respective
membranes. By combining the microstructure
observations, proton conduction and the methanol
permeation results, it can be concluded that the
incorporation of polysiloxane framework in
sulfonated poly(maleic imide-co-styrene) induced a
significant reduction in the ionic cluster size. The
well-distributed spherical ionic clusters effectively
block the permeation of methanol. The resultant
methanol permeability was more than 1 order of
magnitude lower than Nafion-117.
