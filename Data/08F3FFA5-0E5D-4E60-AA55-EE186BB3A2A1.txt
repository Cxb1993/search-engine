on perfusion of the lungs in 43 patients after repair TOF using PC-MRI. They calculated forward
flow volume, backward flow volume, net flow volume and regurgitation fraction in the left and right
pulmonary arteries. Comparsion of the perfusion between the left lung (L%) (L%=left lung/left + right
lung) was provided in their PC-MRI measurements. In terms of the comparsion, they also found that
the PR phnomenon of LPA is higher than RPA in repaired TOF patients.
Helbing et al. [4] explored the abnormalities in right ventricular (RV) diastolic function with 19
children after repair of TOF and 12 healthy volunteers by PC-MR technique. They found that right
ventricular end-diastolic volume (RV EDV) of repaired TOF patients is larger than a healthy person’s.
Furthermore, it was revealed that right ventricular ejection fraction of repaired TOF is lower than
healthy children. Frigiola et al. [5] demonstrated that RV systolic function in 124 patients with
surgically treated TOF is affected by PR. In all patients, right ventricular systolic function of repaired
TOF patients is poorer than healthy children. RV isovolumic acceleration is inversely proportional
to PR in Friginla et al.’s results. van den Berg et al. [6] indicated that some risk factors including
RV abnormal dilation, long QRS duration and severe PR are associated with RV dysfunction in terms
of PC-MRI measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) of 59 patients after repair of TOF. Grothoff
et al. [7] described that PR is an important factor influencing prolongation of QRS duriation in
ECG measurements for 67 patients after repair of TOF. They indicated that PR phenomena usually
accompany QRS prolongation.
Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) has been shown to improve ventricular function, stabilize QRS
duration, and reduce atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in the foloowing studies. For instance, Vliegen
et al. [8] confirmed that PVR can reduce regurgitation and shunting defects in 26 patients after repair
TOF using MRI. Their results showed that the mean preoperative PR was 46±10%. 80% patients had
no residual PR after PVR. They also found that right ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased from
305±87 to 210±62 mL and RV end-systolic volume also decreased from 181±67 to 121±58 mL. van

varing PR in pulmonary ateries after repair of TOF patients by CFD simulations. They also confirmed
that the PR fraction in LPA is higher than in RPA and in LPA. Also, they found that vortices move
toward the pulmonary valve during regurgitation in numerical results. The vortex motion may damage
the pulmonary valve.
Recently, many studies applied medical images to reconstruct 3-D arterial peripheral models for
undertaking accurate CFD simulations. Redaelli et al. [14] detailed reconstruction of 3D vascular
numerical models from magnetic resonance images and performed CFD simulations using the recon-
structed vascular models. Moreover, Tang et al. [15] combined MRI and CFD to analyze bllod flow in
normal pulmonary arteries under resting and exercise states. They reported wall shear stress (WSS),
oscillatory shear index (OSI), and the variation of energy efficientcy due to exercise in pulmonary ar-
teries. They found the low mean WSS regions in the distal pulmonaary arteries no matter in rest or
exercise conditions. High OSI values occurred in those low mean WSS regions and branching locations
where swirling fow and separation flow were observed. They discoverd the energy efficiency average
decrease of 10 % between rest and exercise conditions. They concluded that this approach is useful for
investigation of the disease development and applications of surgical planning. Das et al. [16] calculated
the total energy of the MPA to assess the RV performance between after repaired TOF and normal
pulmonary arteries using MRI and CFD. Their results indicated that the repaired TOF RV has lower
stroke work than the normal one. They also computed the net energy transferred at the MPA that
normal case has higher net energy than repaired TOF case.
CFD has been applied to surgical planning for pulmonary arteries as well (see [17] -[18]). For
example, Hsia et al. [19] studied that the influence of various inferior vena cavas connected to pulmonary
arteries on blood flow using CFD simulations. They considered four basic TCPC geometries which were
reconstructed from angiographic measurements. They demonstrated that the anastomosis in which
extracardiac conduit is connected with left pulmonary artery has the lowest energy loss among four

observe the blood flow distribution and to discuss the effect of geometry on PR in pulmonary arteries
by CFD simulation coupled with 3D reconstructed MRI pulmonary artery models. Futhermore, to find
the reason to cause higher PR in LPA than in RPA, numerical simulations are performed to provide
distribution of pressure, mass flow rate, regurgitation fraction and blood flow streamlines in pulmonary
arteries after repair of TOF.
2 MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE ANDNUMERICALMODEL
In this study, the branching pulmonary artery geometry obtained by MRI is utilized to establish a
numerical model in computational fluid dynamics. The pulmonary artery is a Y shape bifurcate vessel
including LPA and RPA. Various pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF are measured by MRI and
considered to observe regurgitation phenomena. First of all, MRI measurements of pulmonary arteries
after repair of TOF are reconstructed as CAD models. Subsequently, mesh generation is undertaken in
those reconstructed CAD models. Blood flows are then simulated using a flow solver in those numerical
models of pulmonary arteries. Details are demonstrated in the following sections.
2.1 MRI and Grid Generation
In order to establish a realistic 3-D numerical model of pulmoary artery, MRI measurements are utilized
to obtain peropheries of pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF and a healthy person. Regions of the
branching pulmonary arteries are remarked in slice planes of MR images based on DICOM format.
Every slice thickness of Cases 1-3 were 3.6 mm, 4.4 mm and 4.4 mm, respectively. The normal one was
4 mm. Those 2-D remarked regions are connected together be a complete 3-D CAD pulmonary artery
model. Thoes features of four pulmonary models are listed in Table 1. We found that the MPA dilation
phenomenon and an acute angle between LPA and MPA appear in all reconstructed CAD models of
pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF.

2.3 Boundary Conditions
Regurgitation occurs in the pulsatile blood flow of pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF. Regurgitation
fraction, RF, is defined as the ratio of backward blood volume to forward blood volume in a cardiac
cycle. A health person’s RF is usually without regurgitation or very low. High RF indicates that
abnormal blood flow behavior occurs in pulmonary arteries. That is, low RF means that most blood
flows into lungs to exchange oxygen. RF is defin as
RF =
Backward volume in a cardiac cycle,Qb
Forward volume in a cardiac cycle,Qf
, (3)
where Q b and Qf refer to backward and forward blood flow volume in a cardiac cycle, respectively.
To solve those equations, appropriate boundary conditions are required. Fig. 2 shows boundary
conditions used in the proposed numerical model. Blood flow velocity profiles of individual patients
were measured by phase contract MRI at the inlet boundary of the MPA entrance. The PC-MR image
matrix was 256 pixels×256 pixels. The image voxel size of Cases 1-3 were 0.141×0.141, 0.078×0.078
and 0.082×0.082, repectively. The normal case was 0.0625×0.0625. The measured non-uniform flow is
provided for the inlet condition. The interpolation method is used to map the inlet velocity profile to
inlet grid points. Also, RF of Cases 1-3 are 0.337, 0.164, and 0.288 as shown in Table 2, repectively.
The atmospheric pressure is imposed at the exits of the RPA and LPA as the outlet boundary
condition. The vessel wall is regarded as a rigid object. Non-slip boundary conditions are imposed in
vessel wall. That is, velocity is zero in the wall. For the initial conditions of the pulmonary artery,
velocity is set as zero.
2.4 Parameters Setting
The software, CFD-ACE+, based on a finit volume method that is used to calculate the blood flow in a
pulmonary artery. The finite volume method has been applied to solving the Navier-Stokes equations in
many engineering applications. For example, Georgioa and Ioannis [27] used the finite volume method

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Influences of Bifurcation Angles and Geometry of Pulmonary Artery
on Blood Flow
Pulmonary regurgitation is a common phenomenon in patients after repair of TOF, but its effect on
pulmonary arteries is not clear. The established numerical pulmonary artery models include one health
and three pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF. Table 1 shows that Cases 1-3 have smaller angles
between LPA and MPA than a healthy one. θ2 indicating the angle between LPA and MPA are 52◦,
83◦ and 70◦ in Cases 1-3, respectively. Nevertheless, θ2 in a normal pulmonary branch is 112◦. On the
other hand, angles between RPA and MPA in Cases 1-3 are larger than the normal one. θ1 indicating
the angle between RPA and MPA in Cases 1-3 are 134◦, 106◦ and 136◦, respectively. The angle of the
normal one is 125◦.
Fig. 4 desctibes streamlines of the healthy case in a central vertical sectional plane within a cardiac
cycle. There is no regurgitation in healthy pulmonary arteries. Fig. 4 (a) shows the flow pattern in
the acceleration of systole. A smooth forward flow pattern is found in this stage. Subsequently, two
recirculations occur in LPA and RPA due to the deceleration of the forward flow in Fig. 4 (b). Those
two vortices grow and stay in entrances of LPA and RPA in diastole of a cardiac cycle as shown in Figs.
4 (c) and (d).
Since vortices are found in MPA of Cases 1-3 in regurgitation, it is interesting to investigate the
flow structure in specified cross sections. Fig. 5 shows flow patterns of the healthy one and Cases 1-3
in specified cross sections of MPA, LPA and RPA in diastole. According to Perry and Steiner’s [31]
definitions of larger vortex in 3-D flow, a stable node is found in the cross section a-a’ of the healthy
MPA. Sable focuses appear in cross sections b-b’ and c-c’ of healthy RPA and LPA. The stable node in
healthy does not occur in Cases 1-3. One or more one focus are found in MPA of Cases 1-3. A unstable
11
Cases 1-3. It is found that the peak values of pressure of Cases 1 and 2 are higher than the healthy
one in systole. Moreover, negative pressure happens in Cases 1 and 2 in the diastole since regurgitation
happens. It is found that the extreme prssure variation exists at the inlet of MPA of Cases 1 and 2.
The cardiac cycle of Case 3 is longer than other cases, so the systole period of Case 3 is longer than
other cases as well. Due to the larger inlet cross section of Case 3 than other cases as shwon in Table 3,
the peak value of inlet pressure of Case 3 is not so large as Cases 1 and 2. However, obvious negative
pressure due to regurgitation exists in Case 3 in diastole. It is known that the damage of the semilunar
valve is one of complications in patients after repaired TOF. Large inlet pressure variations shown in
Cases 1 and 2 may be one of reasons to induce dysfunction of the pulmonary valve.
3.3 Mass Flow Rate and Regurgitation
The pulmonary artery geometry effects the mass flow rate distributions in MPA, LPA and RPA. Fig. 8
shows time histories of mass flow rates in LPA and RPA of Cases 1-3 in a cardiac cycle. Solid and dashed
curves representing mass flow rates in RPA and LPA, respectively. Red curves shows the variations of
mass flow rates in the healthy one. The mass flow rates in LPA and RPA are very close in the healthy
one. There is no regurgitation in LPA and RPA. Blue, black and green curves represent mass flow rates
in Cases 1-3. Serious regurgitation is found in RPA and LPA of Cases 1-3 in diastole. Also, it is found
that regurgutation always appears in LPA first in three cases. The forward flow amount of LPA is less
than RPA in Cases 1 and 2. The phenomenon does not happen in Case 3. It may be because the
diameter of LPA is larger than that of RPA as shown in Table 3. Meanwhile, the amount of reversed
flow in LPA is larger than RPA in Cases 1-3. Table 3 presents regurgitation volumes of RPA and LPA
of Cases 1-3 in a cardiac cycle. The ratio of regurgitation of LPA to RPA is always higher than 1.
Diameters of RPA and LPA of Caes 1 and 2 are close to each other (see Table 1). Nevertheless, the
ratio of θ1 to θ2 of Case 1 is larger than that of Case 2. As a result, the ratio of regurgitation of LPA
13
recirculation region is found in LPA of all pulmonary arteries after repair of TOF in acceleration of
systole. It obstructs the blood flow toward to the left lung. The strong vortices are found in the dilation
area of MPA in repaired pulmonary arteries during diastole of a cardiac cycle. Nevertheless, there is
no such vortex in healthy MPA in diastole. In the ends of systole and diastole, 3-D complex vortices
motion appears in repaired TOF pulmonary arteries. The blood flow of the health one is smoother than
those. According to numerical results, it is found that the dilation causes abnormal flow distribution
in MPA during regurgitation period in a cardiac cycle.
The comparison of the flow patterns and regurgitation proves that regurgitation happens first in
LPA. The amount of regurgitation in LPA is larger than RPA in numerical results. The effect of
predicted pressure distribution is also discussed. The dilation has extreme pressure change in a cardiac
cycle. Nevertheless, the health MPA does not have such extreme pressure variation. The high pressure
is one of the important factors to generate pulmonary arteries dilation.
We could understand the influnce of pulmonary regurgitation and the blood flow patterns through
this study. The results will be a useful refernce for medical doctors before they perform operations for
TOF patients.

INTRODUCTION
Fluid-structure interactions are common phenomena in flow physics and heat transfer problems, e.g. a 
uniform flow past cylinders and wind past rotating blades. Simulations of fluid-structure interactions are 
challenging and difficult. First of all, the configuration of a structure is often complex, so a distorted or 
unstructured grid is necessary. In addition, given that the solid structure moves or rotates, grids will have to be 
re-generated due to the movement of the solid structure. The flow and heat transfer in a jet engine is a typical 
fluid-structure interaction problem. Air enters to the engine and flows past a series of rotating blades and 
stators. Fuel is burned and combustion occurs in the engine, so heat is generated and transmitted by the 
products of combustion to the rotating blades. Simulations of the air flow and heat transfer in the jet engine 
become difficult due to the complex configuration of the passageway and fast rotating blades. That is, the 
fluid domain always changes and its mesh generation is costly. 
9using an immersed boundary method. The momentum and energy forcing terms are imposed into momentum 
and energy equations followed by the projection method to uphold solve the divergence free condition in a 
non-staggered grid configuration. Some cases regarding heat conduction, forced and natural convection were 
simulated and validated with success. Pan [2006] introduced an immersed boundary method on unstructured 
Cartesian meshes for incompressible flows with heat transfer. The solid body  is identified by  a volume-of-
body (VOB) function analogous to the volume-of-fluid (VOF) function. This VOB approach can also be 
applied to the energy equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition. 
In this present work, we propose an immersed boundary method to simulate fluid-structure interactions with heat 
transfer via the direct-forcing method. The solid object immersed within a flow field can be denoted by  the 
volume of solid function . A cell fully occupied by solids will be denoted as  = 1, while the one fully 
occupied by fluids will be  = 0. A cell occupied party  by  fluids and solids, commonly  called a cut  cell, will be 
denoted by a fractional  which is the volume fraction of solids in the cell. The momentum and energy equations 
for fluids are solved simultaneously with extra virtual forcing and energy  source terms for a solid regime to 
achieve desired boundary conditions on fluids imposed by solids. Numerical details will be described in the 
following section and several flow and heat  transfer problems involving a moving body are computed to 
demonstrate the capability of the present scheme in handling fluid-solid interactions with heat transfer.
MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE AND NUMERICAL METHODS
The governing equations  The continuity, momentum and energy conservation laws are used as the 
governing equations for fluid flows. A Newtonian fluid is considered in this study. The Boussinesq 
approximation for the buoyancy due to the density variation of a fluid is employed. The governing equations 
for an incompressible Newtonian fluid are expressed in the following non-dimensional forms:
 (1)
  (2)
  (3)
where u, p and  are non-dimensional velocity, pressure and temperature, respectively. The dimensionless 
temperature is defined as  , where  is the wall/body temperature and  is a reference 
temperature. In Eq. (2), f represents the virtual force only applied to solids.  is the buoyancy with the 
direction of gravity being . In Eq. (3),  represents the virtual heat source term only  applied to solids to 
achieve desired temperature distribution of the solid object which will further imposes wanted thermal 
boundary conditions on fluids. The dimensionless parameters ,  and  in Eqs. (2) and (3) are defined 
differently later depending on whether the convection is forced or natural. For forced convection without 
buoyancy,  = 1/Re,  = 0 and  = 1/RePr where Re and Pr are Reynolds number and Prandtl number, 
respectively. For natural convection in which buoyancy is important,  = Pr,  = RaPr and  = 1 where Ra 
is Rayleigh number, or we have , ,  and , where  is the 
Rayleigh number.

solid that is known in advance. This is accomplished by the virtual force applied only  to solid part and stated 
as follows 
  (12)
Likewise, we need to compensate the solid temperature to a desired distribution by the virtual heat  source 
term and this gives the following step in advancing  to : 
  (13)
Note that in Eqs. (12) and (13)  and  automatically for a pure fluid cell ( ). For a pure 
solid cell, ( ),  and  are known in advance and the virtual force  and virtual heat source 
 can be computed reciprocally. The integration of virtual force will be a good approximation of the 
resultant force exerted on a non-accelerated solid object via viscous and pressure gradient physically, 
  (14)
The thermal boundary  conditions on a solid surface are  and  for hot and cold surfaces, respectively 
(see Dhole et al. 2006). Once the velocity  and temperature fields are obtained, the local Nusselt number on the 
solid surface is evaluated using 
  (15)
where  is the normal direction of the solid surface. Afterward, surface-average Nusselt number becomes 
  (16)
where  is the total surface area of the solid object . 
In summary, the numerical procedure of the current method at each time step is given below: 
1.Determine  through the position and orientation of the solid rigid object. 
2.Calculate  and  via Eqs. (4) and (5)). 
3.Solve the Poisson equation (Eq. (11)) and advance to  via Eq. (8). 
4.Update the solid velocity to the prescribed value and compute the virtual force required. 
5.Update the solid temperature to the prescribed value and compute the virtual heat      
source required. 
The scheme is basically 2nd order accurate in time and space. However, an extra error may be introduced at a 
fluid/solid boundary and may degrade the total accuracy to be super-linear, unless we interpolate the fluid 
velocity  to fit the exact boundary  condition exerted by the solid object at the boundary, which will generate 
non-physical internal flow inside the solid object. We did not do the interpolation here to maintain the 2nd 
order accuracy in space for the following reason. Herein, by Eq. (12), we let the velocity in each solid cell (
=1) satisfy the actual rigid-body motion felt by the solid object  and the velocity  of a cut  cell ( ) satisfy 
the weighted average (by ) of solid and fluid velocity to compute the virtual force in each cell, which 
summarizes to obtain the total force exerted on a solid object easily. The price of doing this is that it causes 
extra boundary error and sacrifices the 2nd order accuracy in space to be a super-linear one (see Fadlun et al.

Natural convection in a square enclosure with a moving heated circular cylinder  To further demonstrate 
the capability of the present immersed boundary  method in handling fluid-solid interactions with a moving 
hot object, we perform the simulations of natural convection in a square enclosure with a moving heated 
circular cylinder. The cylinder has a diameter , where  is the length of the square enclosure. The 
cylinder sways sinusoidally in the horizontal direction with the amplitude of  as shown in Fig. 7 and 
the non-dimensional swaying frequency  is equal to 1. The instantaneous displacement  of the cylinder 
from its mean position is given by . The cylinder is at  the center of the square enclosure initially. 
The simulation is performed till it reaches a periodic phenomenon. The instantaneous streamline and isotherm 
contours during a cycle are shown in Fig. 8. It should be noted that thermal physical properties of fluid in this 
case are as same as the case of natural convection at Ra = . It is found that  the thermal plume which also 
occurs in a stationary cylinder case as shown in Fig. 8 sweeps above the cylinder due to the sway  of the 
cylinder. The thermal plume plays a vital role in the heat dispersion from the cylinder as shown in Table 3. It 
is interesting to know the effect of the cylinder motion on the behavior of the thermal plume and the heat 
dispersion from the cylinder. In the case of horizontally moving cylinder (Fig. 8), two main eddies due to the 
thermal plume occupy the entire enclosure.  The sizes of those two counter rotating eddies change periodically 
due to their interaction with the cylinder.  In addition to the sway  of the cylinder, the vertical motion of the 
cylinder, which is in the direction of the gravity is also worthy  of investigation. Hence, the simulation which 
considers a cylinder bouncing up and down is undertaken at Ra = . Snapshots of the instantaneous 
isotherm, streamline and vorticity contours during a cycle are presented in Fig. 9.

convection in a square enclosure with a moving heated circular cylinder.

In addition to swaying and bouncing cylinders, we extend our simulation by combining those motions, i.e. the 
cylinder moving in a counter-clockwise circular orbit  which is concentric with the enclosure and has the 
radius . Such a movement stirs the flow inside the enclosure in a more complicated way and may further 
cause more complicated patterns in the natural convection. The description of this problem is given in Fig. 10. 
The isotherm, streamline and vorticity contours during a cycle are given in Fig. 11.
