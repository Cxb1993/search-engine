1. Abstract 
 
This study endeavors to investigate the 
kinematics and head accelerations of real-world 
pediatric headfirst falls in order to improve 
understanding of how head and brain injuries occur 
in children. The mechanisms and thresholds of 
pediatric head injury are not well understood, mainly 
due to difficulties in obtaining pediatric specimens.  
The results from this set of new data using 
multi-body modeling should serve to provide 
researchers a chance to investigate in vivo pediatric 
head injury and reiterate the need for more biofidelic 
models and pediatric post-mortem human subject 
testing.

2. Introduction 
 
Pediatric falls are a leading cause of accidental 
death in children. Falls result in more emergency 
room visits and hospital admissions than any other 
source of injury [1,2]. Head trauma, specifically, is 
the most common injury in children. It has been 
reported that in the United States alone, 500,000 
emergency room visits and 95,000 hospital 
admissions can be attributed annually to pediatric 
head injuries, at a cost of $1 billion [3,4]. Despite 
the prevalence of pediatric head injury, the 
mechanisms of head injury are not as well 
understood in children as in adults. It is clear that the 
mechanisms of the same injury can vary as a 
function of age, due to the differences in the 
developing anatomy of children. Of particular 
interest in head trauma is the development of the 
skull, brain, neck muscles and cervical spine. 
    It is well-known that children are not simply 
small adults, but rather underdeveloped adults.  
However, current pediatric testing surrogates are 
designed based on data scaled from adults [5,6].  
Because of the aforementioned nature of physiologic 
development in children, scaling may not accurately 
represent the properties of the pediatric body.  
Injury tolerance curves for the pediatric population 
are based mainly on scaling from adult cadaveric 
impact responses  
The lack of knowledge in the area of pediatric 
injury response is due to several factors, most 
notably the difficulty in procuring pediatric 
post-mortem human subjects. Because of this, 
methods must be developed in order to study 
pediatric head injury without using specimens.  
Mathematical modeling has been used successfully 
to study adult head and brain injury, but many of the 
more sophisticated finite element models are still 
based on post-mortem human subject data for model 
validation. Since this data is unavailable for children, 
an intermediate modeling step may be useful.  
Multi-body models can provide kinematics and 
biomechanical data, which can yield insight into 
injury if the models are based on well-characterized 
known injury scenarios. 
 
3. Methods  
 
Data collection  
The cases used in this study were collected at 
the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in 
Tainan, Taiwan during a period from December 
2000 to December 2003. Each subject sustained a 
head injury related to a headfirst fall and was 
admitted to the emergency room. This study utilizes 
medical diagnosis and data available  from 
physicians, as well as additional data collected by 
field investigators. These investigators were sent to 
the scene of the fall to gather firsthand accounts 
from eyewitnesses and to survey the scene in detail.  
The circumstances surrounding the fall, head and 
body orientations of the subject at impact, fall height 
and impact surface were all recorded. Data was 
 4 
impact severity and the clinical injury severity does 
allow one to draw some insight from the models of 
these case studies. The only fatal impact modeled, 
Case 7, did not result in the largest predicted head 
accelerations. Instead, two of the cases modeled 
using the P3/2 dummy gave higher results, although 
the injuries in those cases were not as severe 
according to clinical data. Case 4 also showed very 
high head acceleration and was modeled with the 
P3/2 dummy. It is possible the high values found for 
Cases 1, 3 and 4 are due to differences in the P3/2 
dummy as compared to the other P-series dummies.  
However, the differences in the P3/2 dummy are not 
related to the head and neck, but to the thorax, which 
may affect the kinematics of the neck. Results from 
models using other P-series dummies seemed to be 
more reasonable. 
 
6. Conclusions  
      
Although the absolute data generated by these 
models does not accurately predict the accelerations 
seen in the real world cases, it may allow for 
comparison of the relative impact severity between 
cases with their relative head injury severity if the 
same dummy model is used. Even with 
well-characterized cases, the current lack of data 
involving child impact response impedes the ability 
of researchers to create biofidelic models. Results 
from this study could be greatly improved with the 
development of a biofidelic child model that could 
be validated against crash impacts and fall impacts 
for maximum utility. In order to develop improved 
test dummies or dummy models , more data is 
needed on pediatric response in impact situations.  
This data could also be used to develop improved 
contact characteristics for pediatric multi body 
models or to develop sophisticated finite element 
models which are a more economical alternative to 
dummy tests.
