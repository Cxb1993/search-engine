Abstract 
 
Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely studied due to the unique properties. In this study, 
we propose a new design to prepare polyurethane-gold (PU-Au) nanocomposites. The 
11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUD) coated gold nanoparticle (MUD-Au) acts as the chain extender 
and reacts with isocyanates to form covalent bonds between PU and GNPs. A gold nanoparticle 
becomes a center of hard segments, and special star-like cross-linking polyurethane is formed. The 
surface plasmon absorption confirms the existence and size of GNPs in the PU-Au nanocomposite, 
and the intensity increases as the Au content of the added reagents increases. The FE-SEM pictures 
suggest GNPs can be dispersed uniformly in the PU matrix. Maltes-cross delegated the spherical 
crystal are obviously observed in the PU-Au nanocomposites, and the size of crystals decreases 
with the increasing Au content of the added reagents. As the Au content of the added reagents 
increases, both thermal decomposition temperature and the temperature of the maximum 
decomposition rate increase while the amorphous glass transition temperature, crystal melting 
temperature, and melting enthalpy of the soft segment also increase progressively. The results in 
this study indicate that the increasing number of multi-functional GNPs concentrates more hard 
segments and results in increases of the heterogeneous nucleation, the phase separation, and 
elasticity.

Introduction 
 
Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely studied due to the unique properties, such as 
electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, optical properties, chemical absorption, and catalysis [1]. 
Although many research groups have developed the synthesis of GNPs using various 
homopolymers, block copolymers, and dendrimers as the stabilizing or reducing agents [1,2], most 
of them focused their researches on the structural design of polymers to control the shape, size, 
distribution, and application of GNPs and nanocomposites. In these studies, physical or chemical 
absorption between GNPs and polymers can avoid aggregation of GNPs and improve the amount of 
GNPs in the polymer matrix. For the view on applications, preparation of solid bulks, films, or 
membranes of the polymer−gold nanocomposite should have high potentials and be interested. 
Actually, preparation of nanocomposites with GNPs dispersed in the polymer matrix has been 
reported recently and developed quickly due to various applications, such as electrode materials 
[3,4], conducting or semi-conducting [5–7], high-dielectric constant [8], light-emitting [9–12], 
photon-to-thermal energy conversion [13], vapor sensing [14], bio-electrocatalysis [15], and

Experimental Part 
 
Materials 
 
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (Acros), 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUD, Aldrich, 
97%), lithium triethylborohydride (super-hydride, Aldrich, 1.0 M in THF), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD, 
Acros, 99%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, Tedia, 99.9% anhydrous), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 
Tedia, 99.9% anhydrous), and methyl alcohol (Echo, HPLC) were used as received. 
4,4-Diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI, Acros, 99%) and poly(tetramethylene adipate) diol (PTAd, 
Aldrich) with a molecular weight (Mn) 1000 g/mol were dried in a vacuum oven before use. 
 
Synthesis of MUD−Au nanoparticles 
 
In this study, synthesis of MUD stabilized GNPs (MUD−Au) was carried out in a modified 
single-phase system [32]. At room temperature, 300 mg of HAuCl4·3H2O and 151 mg of MUD were 
dissolved in 28.7 ml of THF and stirred for 30 min. The concentration of Au in the mixture solution 
was 26.5 mM. Reduction was conducted by 4.95 ml of super-hydride added drop-wise to the above 
solution under violent stirring, and the reaction was continued for 1 h. MUD−Au nanoparticles were 
purified by centrifugation (9000 rpm) and dried under a vacuum at 35 oC. The amount of MUD on 
the gold surface was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [32], resulting in 28.8 wt.-% 
organic material, corresponding to 71.2 wt.-% gold content. A Zetasizer Nano system (Malvern, 
Zetasizer-3000HS) was used to measure the particle size of MUD−Au redissolved in DMF, and the 
concentration for size measurement was 0.3 g/l. The result showed in Figure 2 indicates the average 
and main particle sizes are 50 nm and 60 nm respectively. 
 
Preparation of PU and PU−Au nanocomposites 
 
A one-step process by solution polymerization in DMF solvent was employed to synthesize the 
poly(ester urethane) and its nanocomposites with gold. The chain extender, 1,4-BD, was replaced 
by MUD−Au in the PU−Au nanocomposites. The sample names and the amounts of added reagents 
were listed in Table 1. A typical synthesis procedure is described below, and the solid content in the 
synthesized solution is 20 wt.-%. PTAd was added into a round-bottomed, three-necked flask 
equipped with a nitrogen inlet and stirred for 30 min at 60 oC. After that, 1,4-BD or MUD−Au 
dissolved in DMF were added into the above flask, and the mixture was stirred at 70 oC for 10 min. 
A DMF solution of MDI was finally added to the flask at 80 oC, and the reaction was continued for 
3 h. The synthesized polyurethane or nanocomposite was precipitated in methyl alcohol at room 
temperature, filtered by reduced pressure, dried under a vacuum at 60 oC for 12 h, and finally stored 
in the dark. 
 
Characterization 
 
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were performed by a Nicolet Magna-IR 550 
spectrometer. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra were performed by an UNICAM UV 500 
spectrometer. X-ray diffraction measurements were made using a Bruker D8 Advance 
diffractometer with a Cu Ka radiation of 1.54 A°. Diffraction patterns were collected from 2θ = 
10–70o with steps of 0.05o and a scan time of 3 s per step. The surface and cross-section images of 
the prepared cast films were observed by a Leo 1530 field emission scanning electron microscopy 
(FE-SEM). An Olympus CX41 polarizing optical microscope (POM) was used to observe the 
morphology of a thin film of the prepared PU or PU−Au nanocomposite.

cross-section FE-SEM image of the TA-Au3 cast film. As showed in the TA-Au1 cast film, well 
dispersed and uniform GNPs are observed, and the particle sizes are around 40–65 nm. The particle 
sizes of GNPs in TA-Au1 are in good agreement with the particle size measurement in DMF. Some 
larger GNPs are observed as the Au content of the added reagents increases, but the sizes of these 
larger GNPs are maintained less than 100 nm. This result consists with the UV-Vis spectra. From 
the literatures [21], an assembly of GNPs was formed when only hydrogen-bonds without covalent 
bonds existed in the polymer matrix. The FE-SEM pictures suggest a gold nanoparticle become a 
center of hard segments in the polyurethane and thus can be dispersed uniformly in the PU matrix.  
 
The crystal morphology of TAB, TA-Au1, TA-Au2, and TA-Au3 cast films by POM are 
presented in Figure 7. Maltes-cross delegated the spherical crystals are obviously observed in the 
PU–Au nanocomposites while the crystals of the pure PU are fine and not obviously observed. The 
size of spherical crystal decreases with the increasing Au content of the added reagents. There are a 
number of spherulites impinging on each other in the higher Au content samples because of the 
increasing nucleation and crystallinity. The POM pictures interpret the expected result that a gold 
nanoparticle becomes a center of hard segments in the polyurethane, and a star-like cross-linking of 
polyurethane is formed. The increasing number of GNPs concentrates more hard segments and also 
increases the heterogeneous nucleation and crystallinity. 
 
Thermal and Mechanical Properties 
 
The TGA curves of TAB, TA-Au1, TA-Au2, and TA-Au3 cast films prepared in this study are 
showed in Figure 8, and the TGA data of all PU and PU–Au nanocomposites are listed in Table 2. 
The prepared ester-type PU and PU–Au nanocomposites have only one step of decomposition 
because the earlier decomposition of the hard segment removes and closes to the later 
decomposition of the soft segment. The accepted reason is the disruption of the phase separation 
resulted from the hydrogen bonding formed between the hard segment and the soft segment. The 
thermal decomposition temperature (Td) defined by 5 wt.-% loss of TAB is 343 oC, and the 
temperature at the maximum decomposition rate (Tp) of TAB is 432 oC. As the Au content of the 
added reagents increases, both Td and Tp increase, and the enhanced thermal stability of PU–Au 
nanocomposites ought to be attributed to GNPs. 
 
Hsu et al. showed small-sized (~5 nm) GNPs in low content (0.0435 wt.-%) in the water-based 
polyurethane could serve as the nucleating agent for crystallization and enhance hydrogen bond 
formation. Molecular motions of the glass transition phenomenon are restricted, and the prepared 
nanocomposite has a better thermal stability and mechanical strength [28]. PU–Ag and PU–ZnO 
nanocomposites also show that the interaction between nanoparticles and PU constrains the 
mobility of polymer chains and increases the glass transition [29,30]. However, the addition of ZnO 
nanoparticles disrupts the phase separation, resulting in weaker mechanical properties after the glass 
transition of the soft segment [29]. The crystal nature of PU might explain the different effects upon 
the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. The improved mechanical strength after the glass 
transition is related to the increased crystallinity of the soft segment induced by GNPs, and the 
opposite behavior results from the less crystallized soft segment, polypropylene glycol (PPG), used 
in the PU–ZnO nanocomposites. 
 
In this study, the DSC curves of TAB, TA-Au1, TA-Au2, and TA-Au3 cast films are showed in 
Figure 9, and the amorphous glass transition temperature (Tg), crystal melting temperature (Tm,s), 
and melting enthalpy (ΔHm,s) of the soft segment are listed in Table 2. As the Au content of the 
added reagents increases, Tg, Tm,s, and ΔHm,s increases gradually in both series. These results are 
similar to the previously mentioned literature [28]. Increases of the fraction of hydrogen-bonded 
carbonyl resulted from the existence of GNPs might also explain the increasing Tg. The melting 
behaviour of PTAd is quite complex, and there are four main melting peaks in the mixture of
