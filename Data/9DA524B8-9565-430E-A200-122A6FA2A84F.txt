Abstract 
An adaptive control system, using a recurrent cerebellar 
model articulation controller (RCMAC) and based on sliding 
mode technique, is developed for a linear ultrasonic motor 
(LUSM). Since the dynamic characteristics and motor 
parameters of the LUSM are highly nonlinear and time 
varying, an adaptive RCMAC-based sliding mode control 
system is designed without mathematical dynamic model to 
control the position of the moving table of the LUSM to 
achieve high-precision position control with robustness. The 
proposed dynamic structure of RCMAC has superior 
capability to the conventional static cerebellar model 
articulation controller (CMAC) in efficient learning 
mechanism and dynamic response. The control architecture 
employs an adaptive RCMAC to mimic the ideal sliding 
mode controller and a compensated controller is designed to 
recover the residual of the approximation error. The on-line 
adaptive laws of the control system are derived based on the 
Lyapunov stability theorem and the gradient descent method, 
so that the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, 
the effectiveness of the proposed control system is verified 
by experimental results of LUSM control system. 
Experimental results show that accurate tracking response 
and superior dynamic performance can be obtained because 
of the powerful on-line learning capability of the proposed 
control system. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
In control engineering practice, stability and robustness 
are of crucial importance. Various approaches have been 
proposed for analysis and design of nonlinear control 
systems. Sliding mode control (SMC) has been confirmed as 
an effectively robust control approach for nonlinear dynamic 
systems [1], [2]. The most outstanding features of SMC are 
insensitivity to system parameter variations, external 
disturbance rejection, and fast dynamic response [3]. 
However, the SMC suffers from two main problems; the 
control input chattering caused by the discontinuity of the 
control action and the assumption of known bounds of 
uncertainties and disturbances. Moreover, to satisfy the 
existence condition of the sliding mode, a conservative 
control law with large control effort usually results. 
Recently, powerful approximation capabilities of neural 
networks (NNs) have motivated intensive research for their 
applications in nonlinear systems identification and control 
[4-11]. According to the structure, the NNs can be mainly 
classified as feedforward neural networks (FNNs) [6-8] and 
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9-11]. As known, the 
FNN is a static mapping. The RNN is a dynamic mapping 
and demonstrates good control performance in the presence 
of unmodelled dynamics [10], [11]. However, no matter for 
the FNNs or RNNs, the learning is slow since all the weights 
are updated during each learning cycle. Therefore, the 
effectiveness of the NN is limited in problems requiring 
on-line learning. 
The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) 
has been proposed in the literature [12], which is classified 
as a non-fully connected perceptron-like associative memory 
network with overlapping receptive-fields. The CMAC has 
been applied in the closed-loop control of complex 
dynamical systems for the following reasons. First, it has 
good generalization capability. Second, it has fast learning 
property and is suitable for on-line applications such as 
signal processing, pattern recognition, and control system. 
The advantages of using CMAC over NN in many practical 
applications have been presented in recent literatures [13-15].

A. Recurrent Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller 
A RCMAC is proposed and shown Fig. 2, in which T  
denotes a time delay. This RCMAC is composed of input 
space, association memory space with recurrent weights, 
receptive-field space, weight memory space and output 
space. The signal propagation and the basic function in each 
space are introduced as follows. 
1) Input space Q: For a given nTnqqq ℜ∈= ],,,[ 21 Lq , 
each input state variable iq  must be quantized into discrete 
regions (called elements) according to given control space. 
The number of elements, En , is termed as a resolution. 
2) Association memory space A: Several elements can be 
accumulated as a block, the number of blocks, Bn , in 
RCMAC is usually greater than two. The A denotes an 
association memory space with An  ( BA nnn ×= ) 
components. In this space, each block performs a 
receptive-field basis function, which can be defined as 
rectangular [12] or triangular or any continuously bounded 
function (e.g., Gaussian [14-17], or B-spline [13]). The 
Gaussian function is adopted here as the receptive-field 
basis function, which can be represented as

where ikφ  represents the kth block of the ith input iq  with 
the mean ikm  and variance ikσ . In addition, the input of 
this block can be represented as 
 )()()( Ttrtqtq ikikiri −+= φ  (14) 
where ikr  is the recurrent weight, ikTik Tt φφ Δ− )(  denotes 
the value of ikφ  through delay time T . It is clear that the 
input of this block contains the memory term ikTφ , which 
stores the past information of the network and presents a 
dynamic mapping. This is the apparent difference between 
the proposed RCMAC and the conventional CMAC. Each 
block in this space has three adjustable parameters ikm , ikσ  
and ikr . 
3) Receptive-field space T: The number of receptive-field 
(areas formed by blocks), Rn , is equal to Bn  in this study. 
Each location of A corresponds to a receptive-field. The 
multidimensional receptive-field function is defined as

experimental results indicate that the high-accuracy motion 
tracking responses can be obtained for both nominal and 
parameter variation cases by using the proposed adaptive 
RCMAC sliding control system with unknown of system 
dynamics.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has demonstrated the effective control 
performance of the adaptive RCMAC sliding control system 
for the linear ultrasonic motor (LUSM) control system. In 
this adaptive RCMAC sliding control system, an adaptive 
RCMAC capturing the dynamic performance is the main 
tracking controller used to mimic an ideal sliding mode 
controller and a compensated controller is designed to 
recover the residual of the approximation error. The on-line 
adaptive laws of the control system are derived based on the 
Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the stability of the 
system can be guaranteed. In addition, in order to relax the 
requirement of approximation error bound, an estimation 
law is derived to estimate the error bound. The experimental 
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control 
scheme for the uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown
