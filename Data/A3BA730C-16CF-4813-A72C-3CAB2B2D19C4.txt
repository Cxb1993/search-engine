required to stabilize the distorted 
structure. Hence Cr3+ ions will move to 
off-center positions where leads to 
strong polarization in the structure. 
2. Experimental procedures 
 The Ca1-xBixNb1-xCrxO3 
(x=0.01-0.5) powders were prepared by 
the sol–gel method using 
[Ca(NO3)2·4H2O], [Bi(NO3)3·5H2O], 
[Cr(NO3)3·9H2O], Titanium (IV) 
n-butoxide [C16H36O4Ti] and citric acid 
anhydrous (CA). Their purities are over 
99.9%. First, the stoichiometric amount 
of Calcium nitrate, Chromium nitrate 
and Titanium (IV) n-butoxide were 
dissolved in ethanol (99.8%). Bismuth 
nitrate was dissolved in de-ionized water. 
Sufficient amount of citric acid were 
added to the former solution as a 
chelating agent to form a solution. Citric 
acid to the total metal ions in the molar 
ratio of 3:2 was used for this purpose. 
The precursor was dried in an oven at 
120 oC for 10 h and then the 
Ca1-xBixNb1-xCrxO3 (x=0.01-0.5) 
powders were obtained after calcinations 
at 800-1000 oC for 5 h in air. The 
calcined powders were then ground and 
pressed at 200 MPa into discs with 
diameter of 10-11 mm and thickness of 
2-3 mm. The discs were sintered in 
ambient air at 1100 oC for 5 h and 
finally gold was deposited on the 
surfaces for microstructural observation. 
The electrodes for dielectric 
measurements were deposited on the 
disk surface by rubbing on an In–Ga 
alloy. 
The phase-purity, structure and the 
lattice parameters of the samples were 
determined by X-ray power diffraction 
(XRD, Rigaku D/max) with Cu-Kα 
radiation at room temperature. The grain 
morphology and grain size were 
characterized by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-3000N). 
The relative density of the sintered 
Ca1-xBixNb1-xCrxO3 were measured 
using the Archimedes’ method in 
de-ionized water. As the temperatures 
ranged from -35 oC to 190 oC, the 
dielectric constants and dielectric loss 
were measured using a LCR meter 
(HP4284A). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Microstructure 
 The TG–DTA curves of the dry 
Ca0.5Bi0.5Nb0.5Cr0.5O3 precursor are 
shown in Fig. 1. The exothermic peak at 
300-500°C in DTA and 17% of the 
initial weight loss in TG is due to the 
burnout of excessive citric acid and 
ethanol and the other exothermic peak 
originates from the burnout of the 
organic groups in citric acid. The 
exothermic peak around 850°C, is 
associate the phase formation from the 
amorphous gel to the polycrystalline 
ceramic. 
 For preparing the ceramic powders, 
the amorphous organometalic gel must 
be heat-treated to pyrolyze the organic 
components for crystallization. Figure 2 
shows the X-ray diffraction patterns 
obtained for various samples calcined at 
1100 oC for 5 h. The single-phase solids 
 2
constant is low at x=0.05 and 0.1 
between the temperatures from -35 to 
190 °C. The dielectric constant of 
around 500 at x=0.05 is less than that of 
around 5000 for x=0.1 at room 
temperature. The dielectric constant 
curve with temperature at x=0.5 exhibits 
two peaks at 25 °C and 55 °C, due to it 
contents two phases. The dissipation 
factors (D) were showed in Fig. 5b. 
When the temperature exceeds 130 °C, 
all of the curves of dielectric loss against 
temperature are warped upwards by the 
effect of leakage current since the 
oxygen vacancies migrate at elevated 
temperatures [14].  
 Figure 6 shows the x-ray 
photoelectron (XPS) spectra of the 
samples (x=0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.3). The 
XPS spectra were analyzed for the 
Cr2P3/2 and Cr2P1/2 levels. Cr2O3 
(576.87 ev), and CrO3 (579.00 ev) [15] 
were observed in the samples (x=0.1 and 
0.3), and the intensity of CrO3 peak was 
increased as Cr contents. This indicates 
that the bulk with high doped BiCrO3 
has presented more Cr+6 ions in sintered 
process. In addition, the dielectric 
properties were also changed due to the 
changes in the components of CrOx. 
 These materials are also expected 
to lose traces of oxygen during sintering 
at higher temperatures [16]. This may be 
represented by the reaction: 
Oo →  1/2O2+ +2 .      (1) OV•• ′e
The oxygen vacancies had a double 
positive charge at higher temperature. 
Below 550oC, the oxygen vacancies 
exist as a single ionized defect  OV
• [17] 
according to the reaction: 
OV
••  + ′e  → OV•      (2) 
From the X-ray powder 
investigations the compound 
Ca1-xBixTi1-xCrxO3 can crystallize with 
structures of the perovskite type. For 
octahedral coordination the metal ionic 
radii Cr3+ = 0.62 Å and Ti4+ = 0.60 Å are 
almost equal. It is therefore likely that 
the metal ions of the compounds are 
randomly distributed in the same 
positions of the perovskite structure.  
The sintering process induces 
trivalent Cr3+ ions substituting for Ti4+ 
ions acting as extrinsic acceptors. 
Similarly, Ti4+ tetravalent ions substitute 
Cr3+ ions acting as extrinsic donors. 
Therefore, OV
••  or  combine with OV
•

TiCr +
+ ′  will form dipoles due to the 
coulombic attraction. These dipoles are 
expressed as OV
• − or 43TiCr ++
′
OV
•• −2 43TiCr ++
′ . These dipoles may 
change their orientation due to the 
hopping of electrons between Cr3+ and 
Cr6+ as mentioned earlier. Jumping of 
oxygen ions through vacant oxygen sites 
will also lead to the re-orientation of the 
dipoles. Nowick et al. [18] observed 
dielectric loss peaks at lower 
temperature in acceptor-doped 
 4
x=0.01 and 0.03, and then the 
coexistence of orthorhombic perovskite 
and the tetragonal structure of BiCrO3 
was verified as presented for x=0.05-0.5. 
No further phases were found. Grains of 
micro-cube topography were obtained 
for x=0.3-0.5. The average grain size is 
about 0.4 and 1.1 μm for x= 0.3 and x= 
0.5 respectively. The highest dielectric 
constant peak was measured at around 
55°C for x=0.5 and at 75°C for x=0.3. 
The amount of Cr6+ increased as x was 
increased. The higher dielectric constant 
value was due to the formation of barrier 
layers at the interface of the bi-phase 
mixed ceramics. Space charge 
polarization contributes to the observed 
behavior.
