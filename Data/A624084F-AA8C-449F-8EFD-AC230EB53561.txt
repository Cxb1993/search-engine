ﬁlm annealed at 450 °C is nearly amorphous. Crystallization of BFO
takes place at temperatures higher than 500 °C. The crystallized thin
ﬁlms consist of randomly-oriented perovskite phase. There are traces
of bismuth oxide observed in the 500 °C annealed BFO ﬁlm. The ﬁlm
annealed at 550 °C consists of pure perovskite phase.
Themicrostructures of BFO ﬁlms annealed at various temperatures
are composed of more or less uniform grains, as shown in Fig. 2. Grain
sizes increase with annealing temperatures. The average grain sizes
are about 10 nm, 30 nm, and 100 nm, respectively, for the BFO ﬁlms
annealed at 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C. It is difﬁcult to distinguish the
second phase from the perovskite phase partly due to the small
amount of bismuth oxide, and partly due to the small grain size. All
BFO ﬁlms are highly densiﬁed without observation of pores.
3.2. Polarization vs. voltage hysteresis curves
Fig. 3 shows the polarization (P)–electric ﬁeld (E) hysteresis
curves of the BFO ﬁlms annealed at 450, 500, and 550 °C. The BFO ﬁlm
annealed at 450 °C is amorphous and paraelectric, its P–E curve is
essentially linear without hysteresis even when the applied voltage is
higher than 24 V (Fig. 3(a)). The P–E hysteresis curves exhibit
signiﬁcant polarization only when the applied voltages are higher
than 12 V for the 500 °C (Fig. 3(b)) and 550 °C annealed (Fig. 3(c))
BFO ﬁlms. The coercive voltage (2 Vr), which is relatively insensitive
to the applied voltage, is about 22 V and 20 V for the 500 °C and 550 °C
annealed ﬁlms, respectively. In contrast, the remnant polarization is
apparently increased by the leakage current.
3.3. Initial current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the annealed BFO
ﬁlms
Fig. 4 exhibits the initial I–V characteristic of the BFO ﬁlms
annealed at 450, 500, and 550 °C, indicating that the leakage current
increases with the annealing temperature. The leakage current is low
for the 450 °C annealed ﬁlm. When voltage increases to about 5.3 V,
the increasing rate of leakage current becomes higher than that in the
low voltage region, but there is no abrupt increase or breakdown
within the measuring range of the equipment (20 V). As for the other
two ﬁlms, the leakage currents increase abruptly at about 3.9 V and
2.3 V, respectively for the 500 and 550 °C annealed ﬁlms. The
threshold voltages of the electric current for these two BFO ﬁlms are
lower than the coercive voltages needed to develop their P–E
hysteresis curves. It demonstrates that the abrupt increase of the
leakage current is not due to rapid increase of polarization in the
ferroelectric ﬁlms.
The leakage current characteristics of each ﬁlm can be divided into
essentially 2 regions. The slopes of ln(I)/ln(V) in each region are
shown in Fig. 4. The slopes of the low voltage region in each ﬁlm are all
very close to 1, which is considered to be caused by Ohmic conduction.
The slopes in the high voltage region are 4.7, 26.1 and 18, respectively
for the 450, 500, and 550 °C annealing ﬁlms. The steep increase in
currents can be explained by the trap-ﬁlled-limit model [14]. After all
traps are ﬁlled up, the subsequently injected carriers will be free to
move in the ﬁlm, so that at a threshold voltage, i.e. 5.3 V, 3.9 V and
2.3 V, respectively for the 450, 500 and 550 °C ﬁlm, the trapped I–V
characteristics transit to the trap-free I–V characteristics. This current
conduction model has already been used to explain the current
conduction mechanism in Mn-substituted BFO ﬁlms [15,16]. The
variation of the Ohmic leakage in the low voltage region indicates that
the carrier concentration in the BFO ﬁlm increases with the annealing
temperature.

the 450 °C annealing ﬁlm does not show resistive switching
phenomenon, which is probably due to low leakage currents.
3.5. Conduction mechanisms of the two resistance states HRS and LRS
To gain more insight in the unipolar resistance switching, the
conduction mechanisms for the HRS and LRS are analyzed. The LRS
can be excellently ﬁtted by the Ohmic conduction model, while the
HRS deviating signiﬁcantly fromOhmic conduction should be ﬁtted by
other nonlinear models. Other conduction mechanisms are classiﬁed
into two categories: bulk-limited conduction and interface-limited
conduction. The interface-limited mechanism includes Schottky
emission which arises from a difference in Fermi levels between a
metal and an insulator or a semiconductor. The Schottky emission can
be expressed as [17]:
J = AT2 exp− Φ
KBT
− 1
KBT
q3V
4πε0Kd
 !1=2" #
where A is the Richardson constant, Φ is the height of the Schottky
barrier, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, K is the dielectric constant
of the ﬁlm, and d is the sample thickness. The bulk-limited
mechanisms include the Poole–Frenkel emission, the SCLC (space
charge-limited current), and Ohmic conduction. The Poole–Frenkel
emission is described as [18]:
J
V
= c exp− Ei
KBT
− 1
KBT
q3V

 !1=2" #
where c is a constant and Ei is the trap ionization energy. The trap-free
SCLC can be expressed as [19]:
J =

8
V2
d3
where μ is the carrier mobility. The Ohmic conduction [20] can be
expressed by:
J≅V
d
exp −c= Tð Þ:
I–V characteristics in the HRS of the BFO ﬁlm annealed at 500 °C
are plotted in Fig. 6(a)–(d) using various current and voltage scales, as
well as those of the LRS (Fig. 6(a)). Fig. 6(a) (lnJ/lnV) illustrates that
the LRS (slope=1) is ﬁtted excellently by the Ohmic conduction
model. The nonlinear conduction of the HRS is ﬁtted by Schottky
emission, Poole–Frenkel emission, and SCLC models in Fig. 6(b)–(d).
Fig. 6(b) and (c), plotting as J vs. V2 and ln(J/T2) vs. V1/2 respectively,
demonstrates that SCLC and Schottky emission models are not
suitable for the HRS in the high voltage region. Fig. 6(d) which
displays the data as ln(J/V) vs. V1/2 exhibits that the Poole–Frenkel
emission model has excellent ﬁt for the HRS in the high voltage
region. Therefore, the HRS can be interpreted as Poole–Frenkel
emission. The Poole–Frenkel emission is effective only for traps
which are neutral when ﬁlled and charged when empty. Traps which
are neutral when they are empty and chargedwhen they are ﬁlled will
not manifest this emission for the lack of Columbic interaction [21].
Fig. 6(d) shows that the slope is 2.3. After substituting the data into
the equation, the optical dielectric constant εi is calculated to be 8.2,
which is very close to the dielectric constant calculated from
εi=n2=6.25 (diffractive index n=2.5) [22]. This further assures
the appropriateness of the Poole–Frenkel emission for the HRS. The
ﬁtting result of the 550 °C annealed ﬁlm is the same as that of the
500 °C annealed ﬁlm and is not shown.
3.6. A tentative description of the resistive switching mechanism
Since the HRS is ﬁtted excellently by the Poole–Frenkel emission, it
is proposed that the observed resistance transition is due to a bulk
effect not an interface effect. Based on the P–E curves, the resistance

I. Introduction 
Recently, nonvolatile resistance random access memory (RRAM) has attracted 
great attention due to its potential application in next-generation nonvolatile memory 
devices [1]. The RRAM devices possess advantages such as nonvolatility, fast speed, 
small bit size, and low power consumption. The memory effect is fulfilled through the 
switching characteristics between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance 
state (LRS). The resistive switching effect was observed in transition metal oxide 
(TMO) materials such as TiO2 [2], NiO [3], and ZnO [4] as well as perovskite oxides 
[5-8] and other materials [9]. Among those materials, TMO materials are compatible 
with present semiconductor manufacturing processes. Electric- pulse- induced 
resistance switching behavior was reported on S and Co doped ZnO thin films [10]. 
Lately, resistance switching behavior was also reported on sputtered pure ZnO and 
sol-gel (Mg0.2Zn0.8)O thin films [4,11]. The resistance ratio of the HRS to the LRS 
was reported to be about 25 at a voltage of 0.65 V (approximately 20 kV/cm) for the 
sol-gel (Mg0.2Zn0.8)O thin films.  Based on the ZnO-MgO phase diagram, 20 % of 
MgO in ZnO is much higher than the reported solubility limit [12], which may result 
in problems of long term stability.  
In this manuscript, we investigated sol-gel (Zn1-x Mgx)O films with MgO 
4 
 
with the Cu Kα radiation. 
III. Results and Discussion 
(A) Effect of film thickness on I- V characteristics 
         To investigate the resistive switching characteristics of the (Zn1-x Mgx)O films, 
the currents were measured by a voltage sweeping mode with 0.1 V step voltage, 
delay time 0.5 s, and hold time 1 s. The current compliance was set at 10 mA to 
prevent films from hard breakdown. Fig.1 shows the I- V characteristics of the pure 
ZnO and (Zn0.9 Mg0.1)O films with 9 and 12 layers thick. The resistance of either the 
pure ZnO or the (Zn0.9 Mg0.1)O film increases with the film thickness. Fig.1(a) shows 
that the pure ZnO film of 9 layers annealing at 700 
o
C does not show resistance 
switching. The current reaches the current compliance before the resistance changes. 
In contrast, the pure ZnO film of 12 layers exhibits resistance switching behavior. The 
current follows through the sequence 1 to 6 as indicated in Fig.1(b). The path 1 is the 
original state before forming. After forming where the resistance changes to a low 
resistance state (LRS), the current follows the path 3, which is the LRS. When the 
voltage increases to Vreset, the resistance switches (resets) to a high resistance state 
(HRS). Then the current follows the path 5 (HRS) until the Vset, where the resistance 
switches again to LRS. The resistance switching behavior is repeatable. Fig.1(c)-(d) 
6 
 
size of Mg
2+
 (0.057 nm) is smaller than that of Zn
2+
 (0.060 nm). In addition, Fig.2(b) 
illustrates that the lattice constant c of the (Zn0.9 Mg0.1)O films decreases with the 
annealing temperature. The decrease of c with annealing temperature is possibly 
caused by higher residual stresses induced after annealing and by higher MgO content 
dissolving into ZnO lattice at higher annealing temperatures. It is also shown that the 
diffraction intensity increases (Fig.2(a)), while the full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) decreases (Fig.2(b), with annealing temperature, indicating that the crystal 
quality improves significantly with increasing temperature. After calculation, the 
decrease is partly due to the increase of the grain sizes, and partly due to the improved 
crystal qualities with temperatures.   
The surface microstructures of all the (Zn1-x Mgx)O films are similar except that 
the grain sizes are different. Figs.3 (a)-(c) show the typical SEM photographs of the 
surface microstructures of the (Zn0.9 Mg0.1)O films annealed at 500, 600 and 700
o
C, 
revealing that the films are uniform and dense. The average grain sizes are 31, 43, and 
65 nm, respectively for films annealed at 500, 600 and 700
o
C. The cross-sectional 
SEM is also exhibited in Fig.3(d), showing that the (Zn1-x Mgx)O films are composed 
of equiaxial grains, not columnar grains.  
The oxidation states of the Zn, O, and Mg ions in the (Zn0.9 Mg0.1)O films were 
8 
 
100 kΩ, and 400 kΩ, respectively for the (Zn0.9Mg0.1)O films annealed at 500, 600 
and 700
o
C. This is probably caused by the significantly improved crystal qualities 
produced at higher temperatures. In addition, the resistance was found to increase 
with the dissolved MgO content.  
A forming process was performed first using the voltage sweeping mode to 
form a LRS before I- V measurements. The I- V curves were measured at least for 50 
cycles. Fig.5(a) displays the I- V characteristics measured at room temperature in 
semi-log scale for the (Zn0.9Mg0.1)O films annealed at 500, 600, and 700
o
C. When the 
applied voltage increases, the current follows the arrow 1 (LRS), switching to a HRS 
at Vreset which is about 1 V. If the voltage is applied between -1.5 and 1.5 V reversibly, 
the current follows the arrows 2 and 3 back and forth, staying in the HRS without 
switching to the LRS. If the voltage is higher than a certain value (Vset), the film 
switches back to the LRS. The distributions of the Vreset  and the Vset measured for 
about 20 cells are displayed in the inset of Fig.5(a). The distribution of the Vreset is 
much narrower than that of Vset. Fig.5(a) also demonstrates that the resistance of the 
LRS remains relatively constant, but that of the HRS varies significantly with the 
annealing temperature. The HRS in films annealed at higher temperatures possesses 
higher value which consequently results in higher resistance ratio (HRS/LRS). The 
10 
 
filamentary model [15]. In order to better understand the process of formation and 
rupture of filaments in the filamentary model, the conduction mechanisms of the two 
resistance states are investigated. I- V curves of the (Zn0.9Mg0.1)O films annealed at 
different temperatures possess almost the same characteristics, therefore, only typical 
curves are shown in Fig.6(a). The I- V curve of the LRS reveals a linear Ohmic 
conduction with a slope of about 0.95-0.98. As for the HRS, the slope equals 1 
initially when the voltage is lower than 0.2 V. Since both slopes in low voltages are 
close to 1, the mechanisms for the LRS and the HRS in the low voltage region are 
supposed to be Ohmic conduction. In higher voltages, the HRS has nonlinear I-V 
characteristics. Nonlinear conducting mechanisms including Schottky emission, space 
charge limited current (SCLC), and Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission were employed to fit 
the nonlinear section of the I-V curves. The nonlinear section is best fitted by the PF 
model:

where J is the current density, E is the applied electric field, q is the electric charge, 
B is the voltage barrier in zero applied electric field, εr is the dynamic dielectric 
constant, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the 
temperature, and r is a coefficient ranging between 1 and 2 [14]. For r=1, the 
12 
 
Highly c-axis oriented sol-gel pure ZnO and (Zn1-x Mgx)O films with x=0.05 
and 0.1 were deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates. Reversible resistive switching 
behaviors with stable switching and high resistance ratio were demonstrated for the 
(Zn0.9Mg0.1)O films. Higher substitution of Mg for Zn results in higher resistance of 
(Zn1-x Mgx)O films, which is beneficial for resistive switching to occur at thinner film 
thickness. The resistance ratio of the (Zn0.9Mg0.1)O films varies from 140 to 1000, 
which is much higher than the value 25 reported recently for sol-gel (Zn0.8Mg0.2)O 
films. Films annealed at higher annealing temperatures possess higher resistance ratio 
due to fewer defects and higher HRS.

Transition from bipolar to unipolar resistance switching of Pt/SrTiO3/Pt stacks

Abstract 
     Pure perovskite SrTiO3 (STO) films were fabricated by rf-magnetron sputtering. 
To investigate the transition from bipolar to unipolar resistance switching of STO 
films, current-voltage characteristics, delay time studies, and capacitance-voltage(C-V) 
measurements were performed.  Bipolar resistance switching of the Pt/STO/Pt stacks 
is proposed as the trapping and de-trapping of ionic defects in the Schottky barriers.  
The variation of the Schottky barrier is supported by C-V measurements.  The 
conduction mechanisms are fitted as Ohmic and SCLC in unipolar switching.  
Therefore, trapping and de-trapping of carriers in the bulk of STO films are proposed 
for resistive switching occurring in the unipolar resistive states.

     STO targets of the nominal composition Sr/Ti= 0.9 with 2 inch diameter were 
prepared by a conventional ceramic processing method. STO thin films were 
deposited on Pt (120nm) /TiO2(50 nm) /SiO2(120 nm) /Si substrates by rf-magnetron 
sputtering.  A gas mixture of Ar/O2 ratio = 80/20 was flown into the chamber to 
build up the working pressure of 10 mTorr.  The sputtering condition was power 60 
W and substrate temperatures of RT, 450, 500, and 550
o
C. The crystal structures of 
the deposited STO films were determined using a grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction 
(MAC MXP-18). The surface morphology of deposited STO films was observed by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6500F). The thickness of the all 
deposited STO films is about 100 nm as obtained from the cross-sectional observation 
by SEM. For electrical measurements, top electrodes of Pt with diameters of 100 µm 
were patterned by rf-magnetron sputtering using metal shadow mask and then 
rapid-thermally annealed at 300
o
C for 4 min. The current-voltage (I-V) properties 
were determined by an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer.  The 
dielectric constant and the dissipation factor were measured with an Agilent 4284A 
LCR meter. The capacitance as a function of voltage (C-V) was also measured with 
the Agilent 4284A LCR meter.  The bottom electrode was grounded in all electrical 
measurements. 
Fig.1 shows the XRD diffraction patterns of STO films deposited at room

not bipolar. When the maximum sweeping voltage is within 3-5 V, the I-V curves 
show bipolar characteristics, as shown in Fig.3(b). The resistance switches from high 
(0→positive) to low (positive→0→negative) and back to high (negative→0). The I-V 
characteristics become increasingly asymmetric, demonstrating that interface effects 
are in charge of conduction.  The resistance is higher in the positive voltage side than 
in the negative voltage side. The current becomes negative during decreasing │V│, 
which is similar to Fig.3(a).  When the maximum sweeping voltage increases to 7-11 
V (as shown in Figs.3(c)), the I-V curves become almost symmetric, implying that 
bulk effects are gradually responsible for conduction.  When the maximum sweeping 
voltage is 12 V, the resistance decreases abruptly and becomes unipolar LRS.  
Negative currents are rarely observed.  The unipolar characteristic is exhibited in 
Fig.3(d) by setting current compliance = 10 mA.  The low resistance state (LHS) 
switches to the high resistance state (HRS) at 1.5 V.  The HRS switches back to LHS 
at 2.8 V.  The resistance ratio (HRS/LRS) of the unipolar state is about 10
3
 which is 
larger than 10
1
 of the bipolar state.  In the bipolar state the HRS remains essentially 
constant, while the LRS changes significantly with the sweeping voltage.   
The hysteresis and negative currents observed in Figs.3(a) and (b) are 
considered to be caused by relaxation.  It can be proved by changing the delay time, 
i.e. the time between the start of measurement and the applied voltage, during I-V 
7 
 
in the bottom STO/Pt Schottky barrier, leading to the lowering of barriers and the 
decrease of resistances. The observed bipolar switching behavior in this work can be 
explained by trapping and de-trapping of ionic defect in the Schottky barriers.
11,14
  
The bipolar resistive states represent states of two different Schottky barrier heights.  
To free the trapped ionic defects, high opposite field should be applied.  Therefore, 
the film remains in the bipolar LRS unless high opposite field is applied.     
The presence of Schottky barrier is demonstrated by C-V measurements.  
Fig.5(a) displays the C-V properties of STO films after applying various sweeping 
voltages.  To prevent the change of the states of the electrically stressed STO films 
during C-V measurements, the applied voltage was limited to ± 2 V.  The C-V curve 
of the original STO film (0 V, i.e. before I-V measurements) exhibits obvious 
M-shape. The M-shape C-V characteristics are similar to those of back-to-back 
Schottky barriers.
16
 The Pt/STO/Pt stack acts like back-to-back Schottky barriers.  
The two maxima are not symmetric, indicating that the two Schottky barriers are not 
exactly the same due to the difference in deposition condition of the top and the 
bottom Pt electrodes. The degree of M-shape decreases with increasing sweeping 
voltage. The M-shape disappears and the C-V curve becomes symmetric when the 
sweeping voltage is larger than 8 or 9 V which corresponds to the symmetric I-V 
characteristics shown in Fig.3.  It indicates that the top and the bottom Schottky 
9 
 
great heat occurring in conduction filaments (at Vreset) in the LRS de-traps carriers, 
which results in switching to the HRS.
18
   
In summary, the transition from bipolar to unipolar resistive switching 
characteristics of Pt/SrTiO3/Pt films was investigated.  Reversible bipolar resistance 
switching of the Pt/STO/Pt stacks is proposed as the trapping and de-trapping of ionic 
defects in the Schottky barriers. The variation of the Schottky barrier is supported by 
C-V measurements.  Since the conduction mechanisms of the LRS and HRS in 
unipolar resistance switching are identified as Ohmic and SCLC, respectively, 
trapping and de-trapping of carriers in the bulk of STO films are proposed for 
switching occurring in the unipolar resistive states.

Effect of reverse remnant polarization on unipolar resistance switching behavior 
of ferroelectric BiFeO3 thin films

Abstract 
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) films were fabricated on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by 
chemical solution deposition. After annealing, the BFO films possessed unipolar 
resistance switching behavior. The effect of reverse remnant polarization on unipolar 
resistance switching was investigated. Reverse remnant polarizations were produced 
by applying a negative voltage under 1μA current compliance for 1.5 s. It is found 
that applying a reverse voltage lower than the coercive voltage reduces the resistance 
of the high resistance state and speeds up its degradation. However, if the reverse 
voltage is higher than the coercive voltage, the stability of the HRS is enhanced.  
 
Keywords: unipolar resistance switching, reverse remnant polarization, bismuth

be polarized. In contrast, the high resistance state (HRS) can be polarized due to its 
capacitive nature. There are some problems in studying the effect of ferroelectricity or 
remnant polarization on unipolar resistive switching. First: if the coercive field is 
higher than the switching field of the HRS (i. e. set voltage), the HRS switches to the 
LRS and cannot be polarized. To overcome this problem, an electric field is applied to 
the HRS of the BFO film under a low current compliance (1 μA) for a period of time 
(1.5 s) so that the HRS will not switch to the LRS, however it can be polarized. 
Second: in the operation of unipolar resistance switching, the electric field is applied 
on one side, either positive or negative, without reversing the applied field. If the film 
has been polarized during unipolar resistive switching, it will not be necessary to 
further polarize the film in the same direction as the electric field. In this case, I-V 
characteristics obtained are already under the influence of remnant polarization. I-V 
characteristic without the influence of remnant polarization cannot be measured. If the 
remnant polarization is produced in a direction different from the electric field 
employed in resistive switching, the effect of the remnant polarization is possible to 
be verified. Among them, applying an electric field in the reverse direction (negative 
field) to invoke a reverse remnant polarization is one of the most convenient methods.  
In this investigation, we report the effect of reverse remnant polarization on 
unipolar resistive switching of BFO thin films.

Fig.1 shows that crystallization of BFO films occurs at temperatures higher than 
500
o
C. The film annealed at 450
o
C remains amorphous.  BFO films annealed at 500 
and 550
o
C show randomly-oriented perovskite structure. The 500
o
C-anneled film 
contains some second phases as evidenced by diffraction peak at 2=28o, which is 
probably not completely reacted Bi2O3. The BFO film annealed at 550
o
C shows 
single-phase perovskite and stronger diffraction peaks. 
Fig.2 shows the surface morphologies of BFO films annealed at 450, 500, and 
550
o
C. The film annealed at 450
o
C is very smooth, which is a characteristic of 
amorphous films. The BFO films annealed at 500 and 550
o
C possess grained 
microstructure. The surface roughness increases with the annealing temperature. The 
area surrounding grains in the 500
o
C-anneled BFO film is considered amorphous. In 
the 500
o
C-anneled BFO film, the area surrounding large grains changes to smaller 
grains, which is due to continuous crystallization of perovskite in that area. The result 
is stronger perovskite diffraction as observed in Fig.1. The thickness of the annealed 
BFO film is about 160 nm as determined from the cross-sections of the BFO film by 
SEM. Since the 550
o
C- annealed film possesses better crystallization of perovskite 
and is single-phased, the following characterizations were based on the 
550
o
C-anneled BFO film.  
Polarization-electric field (P-E) curves are shown in Fig. 3(a), exhibiting that 
 7 
Fig. 4(a) shows the I-V characteristics of the first ten cycles with a -2 V reverse 
voltage, indicating that the LRS remains essentially constant, but the HRS tends to 
approach the LRS during the successive cycles. Fig. 4(b) shows the I-V characteristics 
of the first ten cycles with a -5 V reverse voltage, demonstrating that the approach of 
the HRS towards the LRS is much smaller than that shown in the case of the -2V 
reverse voltage. To illustrate the behavior clearly, the variations of currents measured 
at 0.2 V in the two resistance states during successive cycles with different reverse 
voltages are displayed in Fig. 5. The currents of the LRS remain relatively constant, 
while those of the HRS show rapid increase initially, and then change slowly for some 
cycles; finally a rapid increase of current occurs again. The cycle number where the 
final rapid increase of current occurs depends on the magnitude of the reverse voltage. 
They are the 17th, 15th, 7th, 7th, and higher than 20th, respectively, for 0 V( no 
reverse voltage), -2 V, -3V, -4V, and -5 V reverse voltages, as shown in Fig. 5. 
Different measuring points show similar trend. When the reverse voltage is lower than 
a certain level, the resistance of the HRS is invoked to approach that of LRS faster 
than the one without a reverse voltage. However, when the reverse voltage is higher 
than a certain value, -5 V in this case, the degradation of HRS is postponed or 
eliminated. P-E curves shown in Fig.3 indicate that the boundary is closely related to 
the coercive voltage, which happens to be around 4 to 5 V in this BFO film. Therefore,

In summary, the effect of reverse remnant polarization on unipolar resistive 
switching of ferroelectric BFO films was investigated.  It is found that applying a 
reverse voltage lower than the coercive voltage reduces the resistance of the high 
resistance state and speeds up its degradation. However, if the reverse voltage is 
higher than the coercive voltage, the stability of the HRS is enhanced.

Abstract 
     Perovskite SrZrO3 (SZO) films were fabricated by sol-gel spin-coating method 
on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates. The effect of current compliance on the reset switching of 
the low resistance state (LRS) was investigated. The current compliance was found to 
influence the reset characteristics to a great extent. With increasing current 
compliance, the distributions of the reset current and the reset power of the LRS 
increase with increasing current compliance, while the distribution of the reset voltage 
of the LRS decreases. Higher current compliance is advantageous for voltage-driven 
reset switching and lower current compliance is beneficial for current and 
power-driven reset switching.

parameter for resistive switching effect is the value of the compliance current. By 
setting the compliance current to a larger value, TiO2 thin films were reported to 
change from bipolar switching to unipolar switching characteristics
22
. In addition to 
the type of resistive switching, current compliance may influence the reliability of 
actual write operation. In this letter, we report the effect of current compliance on the 
unipolar resistance switching of SZO thin films. 
       The precursor solution of SZO was synthesized by dissolving 
strontium acetate (99%, Strem Chemical) and zirconium acetylacetonate (98%, Fluka) 
individually in propionic acid (99%, Riedel-de Haen) at 80
o
C for 30 min. The two 
dissolved solution were combined in a mixed solvent with propanol (99.7%, 
Seedchem) : butanol (99.5%, Scharlau) = 6:4 by weight at 80
o
C for 30 min. The 
prepared 0.1 m SZO precursor solution was spin-coated on Pt (50nm) /Ti (50 nm) 
/SiO2(140 nm) /Si substrates at 150 rpm for 10 s followed by 3000 rpm for 20 s to 
form thin films. The deposited films were pre-baked at 160
o
C for 5 min followed by 
baking at 400
o
C for 20 min.  The spin coating was repeated 4 times to build up 
suitable thickness. The deposited films were annealed at 500, 600, and 700
o
C for 10 
min in air atmosphere. The crystal structures of SZO films annealed within 500-700
o
C 
were determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku x-ray diffractometer. The 
surface and cross-sections of SZO films were examined by scanning electron 
5 
 
SZO MIM device with a current compliance 5 mA. The HRS and LRS change with 
the chosen current compliances. Fig 3(b) shows three LRSs under different current 
compliances. The resistances of the typical LRS are 127, 106, and 66 , respectively, 
for current compliances 0.5, 5.0 and 50 mA in the figure.  The resistance of the LRS 
decreases with the current compliance. The result can be explained by the commonly 
accepted filament model (or categorized as thermal effect)
14,23,24
. Typical resistive 
switching based on thermal effect exhibits a unipolar characteristic. It is initiated by a 
voltage-induced partial dielectric breakdown in which the material in a discharge 
filament is adjusted by Joule heating. Because of the compliance current, only a weak 
conductive filament with a controlled resistance is formed. During the reset transition, 
this conductive filament is again disrupted thermally due to high power density 
generated locally
25,26
. The strength of conductive filaments increases with the current 
compliance. Stronger filaments can resist higher heat from rupture. Therefore, it is 
generally thought that higher current compliance will result in higher reset voltage 
and higher reset current. However, the reset voltages and reset current generally have 
certain distribution, higher compliance is not necessary to cause higher reset voltage 
in practical operations. Little work was contributed to the study of the distribution of 
these parameters. 
 Fig.4 plots the reset currents and reset voltages during successive voltage 
7 
 
by current pulse, lower current compliance will be more helpful for the write 
operation due to its smaller distribution. Another way to show the effect of current 
compliance on reset switching is in terms of reset power (= reset voltage x reset 
current), which is shown in Fig. 5(c). The average reset power increases with current 
compliance as expected. In addition, the reset power distribution also increases with 
the current compliance. There are cases which reset switching needs power as high as 
two times of the average value. Therefore, if the reset switching is written by power 
pulse, the lower current compliance is more advantageous because of smaller 
distribution. Based on the distribution and analysis of the reset data, current 
compliance deserves further investigation for best memory operations. 
Fig.6 shows the reset power versus the resistance of the LRS. The resistance of 
the LRS at 50 mA current compliance remains almost constant, while the reset power 
has a higher distribution. In contrast, the change of the reset power is relatively small 
for lower compliances: 0.5 and 5.0 mA, while the variation of the resistance of the 
LRS is huge. 
In summary, current compliance was found to affect the reset characteristics to a 
great extent. The distributions of the reset current and the reset power increase with 
increasing current compliance, while that of the reset voltage decreases with 
increasing current compliance.  Higher current compliance is advantageous for
