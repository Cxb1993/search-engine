4. Research Methods 
In this research, an image is segmented into several clusters using the K-means 
algorithm based on the similarity of colors, and the root-mean-square standard 
deviation (RMSSTD) is used to measure the similarity between clusters. Artificial 
neural networks are harnessed to develop the Rust Intensity Recognition Approach for 
Steel Bridge Surface Coating Images Based on Artificial Neural Networks (RIRAN). 
The processed results by RIRAN are compared to the clustering results of statistical 
analysis. 
 
4.1 Regional Clustering 
The objective of image segmentation is to cluster an image into multiple groups so 
that objects could be identified and the image could be easily analyzed [7]. Clustering 
analysis is one of the image segmentation techniques to group multivariate objects 
into several clusters based on similarity, such as distance between colors, etc. 
Although clustering analysis is applied in image segmentation, its procedure is often 
faced with one problems, determining the right number of clusters [8]. Most 
previously developed steel bridge surface assessment methods segment a rust image 
into two clusters, namely, rust and background. Yang et al. recently classified a rust 
image into three parts: background, rust, and non-defined colors. However, these 
methods lack the ability of recognizing rust intensity, since the number of clusters is 
pre-determined. To provide better assessment, Chen [8] used the root-mean-square 
standard deviation (RMSSTD) [9-10], defined in Eq. (1), to measure the standard 
deviation of all the variables. A smaller RMSSTD indicates greater similarity between 
groups.

To start, all pixels of a color image were grouped into two to ten clusters by the 
K-means algorithm based on the similarity of pixels in the RGB color space. Eq. (1) 
was then used to calculate the RMSSTD value of each cluster, and all the RMSSTD 
values were input to the ANN. Afterwards, the survey results were employed to set the 
target values. By comparing with the target values, the ANN was trained and updated. 
 
To obtain the target values for ANN, a questionnaire survey was conducted to collect 
the number of clusters for each rust image. The number of clusters recognized by 
most survey participants (i.e., the mode value) for a rust image was deemed as the 
target value for that image. The questionnaire comprised 47 256×256- pixels images, 
and there were 41 participants in the survey. Fig. 5 shows some example rust images 
in the survey and their corresponding clustering results using K-means.

Approach based on ANNs (RIRAN). 
 
First, a rust image is converted to RGB. All pixels of an image are then divided into 
two to ten clusters using the K-means algorithm based on the similarity of color 
features. Second, RMSSTD is calculated for each cluster, and all RMSSTD values are 
input to a pre-trained ANN. The output, K, of the ANN is the best clustering number. 
Finally, the K-means algorithm is applied to segment the image into K groups [12].

Fig. 8: Recognition results by RIRAN and statistical analysis. 
 
According to Fig. 8, the images were mostly segmented into two clusters by statistical 
analysis because the most significant difference is between the rust and background. 
Image no. 3 was segmented into three clusters by statistical analysis because the color 
difference between dark and light rust colors was significant. 
 
It is clear that RIRAN segmented all the images correctly in Fig. 8. Moreover, RIRAN 
can provide more detailed information, such as rust intensity. The rust percentages of 
Image no. 4, for example, are 40.18% and 29.47% by RIRAN and statistical analysis, 
respectively. The lightly rusted area near the boundary of the rust can be identified by 
RIRAN, which fails to be recognized by the statistical analysis. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This research combines RMSSTD and ANNs to develop a new rust image recognition 
method called RIRAN, which is able to recognize rust intensity. RIRAN can be used 
for steel bridge coating assessment, and its effectiveness is proven through 
comparison with the statistical analysis.

rust ratio. However, they are usually lack of the ability to 
recognize the intensities of rust defects. In order to provide 
a precise assessment, Yang et al. [7, 8] developed the 
adaptive ellipse approach (AEA) to classify the images into 
three parts: background colors, rust colors, and non-defined 
colors (such as mild rust colors, etc.). In AEA, background 
colors and rust colors are defined by the fundamental 
ellipse, and non-defined colors could be identified by 
adjusting fundamental ellipse. It is still insufficient in 
describing gradually changed colors and thus unable to 
classify those colors automatically. In this regard, this 
paper is focused on the development of a new approach 
that could classify the rust images into suitable number of 
groups for describing gradually changed colors 
automatically, which has been a hurdle in the two- or three-
group systems. To start, the image is segmented into 
several clusters based on the similarity of colors by K-
Means algorithm, and the root-mean-square standard 
deviation (RMSSTD) is used to measure the similarity of 
each cluster. Artificial Neural Network is then adopted to 
develop the proposed method, a rust intensity recognition 
approach for steel bridge surface coating images based on 
Artificial Neural Networks (RIRAN). The segmentation 
results of RIRAN will be compared with the clustering 
results by statistical analysis. 
 
2. REGIONAL CLUSTERING 
The objective of image segmentation is to partition an 
image into multiple groups so that objects could be 
identified and the image could be easily analyzed [9]. 
Clustering analysis is one of the image segmentation 
techniques to groups multivariate objects into several 
partitions based on the similarity measure, such as distance 
between colors. Although clustering analysis is applied in 
image segmentation, its procedures often faced one 
unavoidable problems [10], defining the number of cluster. 
Most of the previously developed steel bridge surface 
assessments grouped images into two clusters, rust and 
background. Yang et al. latterly classified the images into 
three parts: background colors, rust colors, and non-defined 
colors. However, these methods are lack of the ability to 
recognize rust intensity automatically, as the number of 
image clusters has been fixed. 
In order to provide a flexible assessment, Chen [10] used 
the root-mean-square standard deviation (RMSSTD) [11, 
12], defined in equation (1), to measure the standard 
deviation of all the variables. The smaller value of 
RMSSTD means more similarity within the groups.

where k denotes the number of clusters and S2j means the

Fig. 1b shows the plot of RMSSTD value under different 
number of clusters using Fig. 1a as a model. The value of 
RMSSTD decreases along with the increased number of 
clusters.

In order to avoid too many trivial groups, Chen chose the 
largest difference of the RMSSTD value between n and n-1 
clusters as an appropriate number of clusters, n.

First, rust images were converted into RGB space. All 
pixels of the images were segmented into 2-10 clusters 
using K-Means algorithm based on the similarity of color 
feature. Second, we calculated the RMSSTD values of 
each number of clusters. The series of RMSSTD value 
were the input to the pretrained ANNs. The output, K, of 
ANNs would be the best clustering number. Finally, we 
applied K-Means algorithm to segment image into K 
groups, and identified the rust groups by image 
segmentation methods base on color feature [14]. 
The main chemical compounds consisting rust are either 
FeOOH or Fe2O3．3H2O [15]. It is possible to define the 
rust in a specific color range by its color feature because 
the color difference between or within the two compounds 
is not significant. In order to define an appropriate color 
range for rust, we collected a set of sample color of rust. In 
this research, we collected several bridge images and cut 
off rust area by naked eyes. Pixels of these rust areas were 
collected in rust database. The color spectrum of the rust 
database is shown in Fig. 7. These data have been collected 
as a specified color range to define the color range of rust. 
 
Fig. 7 Color spectrum of rust database. 
We then evaluated the ‘average’ color of the set. The 
average would be the center of the specific color range. By 
determining whether the ‘average’ color of a group is 
within the specific color range or not, we could classify 
each group in an image. The group was classified as rust if 
it’s ‘average’ color was inside the specified color range. 
Afterward, the rust percentage can be calculated after 
identifying rust groups.
