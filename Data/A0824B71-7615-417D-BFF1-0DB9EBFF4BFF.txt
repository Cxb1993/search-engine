Abstract 
Low frequency damping properties of Ni2MnGa and NiMnTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) 
were investigated by dynamic mechanical analyzer I this study. The Ni2MnGa alloys can 
possess good inherent internal friction under isothermal conditions at a wide temperature range 
from -100 to 100oC. The Ni2MnGa SMAs with higher martensitic transformation temperature 
are candidates for high damping applications since they can perform good inherent internal 
friction above room temperature. The NiMnTi SMAs possess an internal friction peak with tan δ 
=0.087 at approximately 125oC. The NiMnTi SMAs also exhibit a relaxation peak with tan δ 
=0.027 at approximately -45oC and its activation energy is calculated as 0.64±0.03 eV. The 
damping capacity of the relaxation peak decreased with the increase of thermal cycling. The 
NiMnTi SMAs possess an inherent internal friction peak with tan δ =0.009 at temperature 
approximately 140oC and may serve as a high damping alloy for practical engineering 
applications. However, the undesirable brittle characteristic of the Ni2MnGa and NiMnTi SMAs 
critically limits their workability and should be overcome before serving as high-damping 
materials. 
Keywords: shape memory alloys (SMA); martensitic transformation; internal friction; dynamic 
mechanical analysis (DMA).

Ni2MnGa SMAs reported by Chernenko et al. 
[9], curve 1 can be classified as Group I 
Ni2MnGa SMA because its TM temperature is 
well below room temperature and TC. Besides, 
curve 2 can be categorized as Group II SMA 
since its TM temperature is close to room 
temperature but below TC. Curve 3 can be 
labeled as Group III SMA due to its high TM 
temperature (above TC). As shown in Fig. 1, 
the IF peaks for Groups I and II SMAs exhibit 
a high tan δ value above 0.11 while that for 
Group III SMA only shows an inferior value 
about 0.08. In addition, in Fig. 1, the IF peak 
of Group I SMA at TI temperature only has a 
low tan δ value (about 0.02) in cooling. This 
owes to that the parent to intermediate phase 
transformation (P→I) is only associated with a 
soft 1/3TA2 phonon mode condensation, 
instead of a significant martensitic 
transformation (P→M or I→M) with 
structural change [9].  
Figure 2 shows the tan δ curves of the 
NiMnTi SMA. In the tan δ curve, there was an 
IF peak with tan δ=0.087 observed at 
approximately 125oC, which is corresponded 
to the β → 'θ  martensitic transformation. 
Except for the β → 'θ  IF peak, there was 
also a lower internal friction peak with tan 
δ=0.027 observed at approximately -45oC. 
This extra peak is the relaxation peak [3]. The 
formation of the relaxation peak is related to 
the interaction of hydrogen with the motion of 
high-density twin boundaries in martensite 
[10]. In the present study, the hydrogen atoms 
could originate from the chemical reaction of 
the trace residual H2O in the evacuated quartz 
tube with the NiMnTi SMA ingot at a high 
temperature of 900oC. 
Figure 3(a) demonstrates the DMA 
cooling tan δ curves versus temperature for 
the NiMnTi SMA measured at different 
frequencies from0.5 Hz to 10 Hz. The peak 
temperature (TP) of the relaxation peak 
gradually shifted to a higher temperature with 
the increase of the frequency. Consequently, 
the activation energy E of the relaxation peak 
can be calculated by the following equation 
[10]: 
1)/exp(2 PB0 == TkEfτπωτ         (1) 
where ω is the angular frequency, τ the 
relaxation time, f the frequency, E the 
activation energy for the relaxation process, 
and kB the Boltzmann constant. Figure 3(b) 
plots lnf versus 1/TP for the relaxation peak of 
the NiMnTi SMA. Using the slope and the 
intercept of the fitting line (R2=0.998), the 
values of the activation energy and the 
relaxation time are calculated as E=0.64±0.03 
eV and τ0=1.7×10-16±0.2 s, respectively. The 
activation energy value for the relaxation peak 
of the NiMnTi SMA is comparable to that of 
Ti-Ni-Cu (about 0.67-0.76 eV) [10], 
Ti-24Nb-3Al (about 0.5 eV) [11], and other 
TiNi-based SMAs (about 0.5 eV) [12-14] 
SMAs. However, the peak temperature for the 
relaxation peak of the NiMnTi SMA is 
approximately -45oC when measured at 1 Hz, 
which is much higher than the peak 
temperatures of Ti-24Nb-3Al (about -120oC) 
[11], Ti49.2Ni50.8 (about -73oC) [14], Ti50Ni50 
(about -75oC) [4], and Ti49Ni41Cu10 (about 
-60oC) [15] SMAs. Relaxation peaks possess 
the advantage that their damping capacity 
does not decrease as significantly as the 
damping capacity of normal martensitic 
transformation IF does [15]. Nevertheless, the 
relaxation peak temperature of the NiMnTi 
SMA was still too low for practical 
applications. Furthermore, the damping 
capacity of the relaxation peak gradually 
diminishes with the number of thermal cycling, 
because the DMA experiments were 
 6
min isothermal treatment. Figure 5 shows that 
an inherent β → 'θ  martensitic transformation 
IF peak, i.e., 
'IPT )IF(IF θβ →+  with tan δ=0.011 
appeared at approximately 150oC. Comparing 
to the tan δ curves measured under isothermal 
conditions for Ti50Ni50 [4], Ti51Ni39Cu10 [14] 
and Cu-13.5Al-4Ni [19] SMAs, both Ti50Ni50 
and Ti51Ni39Cu10 SMAs exhibit good damping 
capacity of IFPT+IFI peaks during martensitic 
transformations (tan δ > 0.02) and IFI in the 
transformed martensite phase (tan δ > 0.01), 
because the transformed martensite phases 
(R-phase and B19’ for Ti50Ni50 SMA, B19 and 
B19’ for Ti51Ni39Cu10 SMA) all possess 
movable twin boundaries to dissipate energy 
during damping [4, 15]. However, Ti50Ni50 
and Ti51Ni39Cu10 SMAs only exhibit good 
damping properties at temperatures below 
75oC. On the other hand, Cu-13.5Al-4Ni SMA 
has a 
'
11
)IF(IF IPT ββ →+  peak at about 175
oC. 
Nevertheless, the damping capacity of the 
'
11
)IF(IF IPT ββ →+  peak is extremely low (tan 
δ<0.005) because the transformed '1β  
martensite has an ordered 9R structure with 
stacking fault rather than a twinning structure 
with movable twin boundaries [19]. Compared 
to other SMAs, the 
'IPT )IF(IF θβ →+  peak of the 
NiMnTi SMA possess an acceptable inherent 
internal friction with tan δ =0.009, but also 
exhibit a high inherent internal friction peak 
temperature at approximately 140oC. 
Consequently, the NiMnTi SMA could be a 
potential high damping alloy, especially for 
applications at elevated temperatures. 
Nevertheless, the undesirable brittle 
characteristic of Ni-Mn-Ga and Ni-Mn-Ti 
SMAs critically limits their workability and 
should be overcome before serving as 
high-damping materials. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Groups II and III Ni-Mn-Ga SMAs can 
exhibit and maintain high damping capacity as 
well as Ti50Ni50 and Ti51Ni39Cu10 SMAs even 
after repeating thermal cycles. Nevertheless, 
the undesirable brittle characteristic of 
Ni-Mn-Ga SMAs critically limits their 
workability and should be overcome before 
serving as high-damping materials. The 
NiMnTi SMA possessed a 'θβ →  martensitic 
transformation IF peak with tan δ =0.087 at 
approximately 125oC in the DMA tan δ 
cooling curve. The NiMnTi SMA also exhibit 
a relaxation peak with tan δ =0.027 at 
approximately -45oC and its activation energy 
is calculated as 0.64±0.03 eV. The damping 
capacity of the relaxation peak decreases with 
the increase of thermal cycling. The relaxation 
peak diminished due to the dissipation of 
hydrogen atoms when the specimen was 
heated to an elevated temperature. The 
NiMnTi SMA possessed an inherent internal 
friction peak with tan δ =0.009 at temperature 
approximately 140oC and may serve as a high 
damping alloy for practical engineering 
applications.
