interconnect analysis are under avid 
research in recent years. On-shelf 
commercial tools based on the finite 
element method (FEM), such as Ansoft 
HFSS and Q3D, are too computationally 
expensive for calculating S-parameters 
or equivalent circuits in whole-chip 
simulation. Since IE-based methods only 
involves surface unknowns, the number 
of unknowns is far less than that of FEM. 
Therefore, the former is more promising 
for solving large-scale problems than the 
latter. However, the superior 
computational efficiency of the IE-based 
method is not without cost. The 
multilayered Green’s function involves 
singular integral in spectral domain and 
is much harder to be formulated and 
implemented than the FEM. Besides, the 
multilayered Green’s function becomes 
unstable when the dimension of the 
structure is less than one wavelength. 
The only remedy is to decompose the 
electric current by loop and tree 
functions at low frequencies, so the 
magnetostatic and electrostatic 
contributions to the field can be captured 
accurately. Furthermore, the results 
obtained from frequency-domain EM 
simulation, such as S-parameters, cannot 
be readily used in timing analysis of 
interconnects. Therefore, it is necessary 
to convert system transfer functions into 
broadband equivalent circuits, so the net 
lists can be incorporated seamlessly into 
SPICE-like circuit simulators. 
 
In this report, we will introduce key 
accomplishments of the one-year project, 
including the decomposition of 
multilayered Green’s function at low 
frequencies, fast algorithms for loop and 
tree extraction, and an optimal algorithm 
for broadband equivalent circuit 
extraction. 
 
II. Decomposition of the Multilayered 
Green’s Function at Low Frequencies  
 
For interconnects embedded in 
dissimilar dielectric layers, the most 
efficient way to analyze signal 
propagation is to apply IE-based 
methods, such as the method of 
moments (MoM) with dyadic Green’s 
functions for multilayered media [1]. If 
we apply the surface integral 
formulation, currents are assumed to 
flow on the surface of conductors. Since 
only surface unknowns are involved, it 
generally requires less computational 
resources than volume-unknown based 
methodsm, such as FEM and 
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) 
method. 
 
The dyadic Green’s function can be 
decomposed into TM and TE 
contributions [2]. We further separate 
the divergence-free and 
non-divergence-free contributions from 
the TM and TE components to make the 
integral equation stable at low 
frequencies. 
 
If both source and observation points are 
located in the same layer of dielectric 
materials, the dyadic Green’s function 
has the form

where RWGG  represents the interaction

If the source and field points are in 
different layers, the dyadic Green’s 
function assumes a different form 
 
more efficient for extracting loops on 
structures with large surfaces and a few 
interconnects. Hence, it is especially 
advantageous for the analysis of 
interconnects in between large reference 
planes. 
 
IV. Broadband Equivalent Circuit 
Generation for Large-Scale 
Interconnect Analysis 
 
For the broadband equivalent circuit 
generation, we find that the vector fitting 
method (VFM) [6] is superior to the 
complex frequency hopping (CFH) 
method [7]. The main reason is that 
VFM can predict poles outside of the 
range of sampling frequencies, where 
CFH can not. More detailed comparison 
of the two methods can be found in 
Wang’s thesis [8], where broadband 
macromodels (i.e. equivalent circuits) 
are generated for simple antenna 
systems. For dipole antennas with clear 
resonant/anti-resonant peaks, there must 
be one pole associated with each peak. 
Only VFM can extract the correct poles 
associated with the 
resonant/anti-resonant peaks. 
 
We further modify VFM for 
macromodel generation of a 32-port PCI 
Express bus on a PCB. With

Express bus on a PCB. 
 
proprietary technologies, the number of 
circuit elements generation by our 
in-house code is 32% less than the 
traditional VFM (291,230 vs. 427,584). 
The reduction in circuit simulation time 
is even more obvious (1,890 vs. 10,593 
sec).  As the number of ports increases, 
our algorithm exploits the distinctive 
characteristic of individual transfer 
function. Therefore, the number of poles 
for the state-space realization is 
significantly reduced. A statistic model 
has also been developed for predicting 
the percentage reduction of circuit 
elements prior to equivalent model 
generation. Detailed results will be 
shown in [9].

V. Conclusions 
 
We have developed three key 
technologies for interconnect analysis at 
low frequencies. Using the topologically 
based algorithm for loop-tree extraction, 
there is no need to discern the types of 
basis functions. The loop reduction 
process guarantees the independence of 
loops. Therefore, there is no need to 
perform independence check repetitively 
as in the greedy method. Besides, the 
decomposition of multilayered Green’s 
function at low frequencies enables us to 
see divergence-free (loop) and 
non-divergence-free (tree) current 
components even before the surface 
current is discretized. It also make the 
computation of MoM impedance matix
