    Introducing the share ride has enhances the car occupancy rate can not only relieve traffic congestion,but 
can also cheapen the travel cost and save energy. But fairness would affect share ride members that join in the 
activity.Therefore, we propose an architecture based on Multi-agent Based Computation Modelling and 
Simulation (MACM&S) in order to dispatch a fleet of vehicles in a purely dynamic transportation on demand. 
The major focus of shared ride’ MACM&S system match the travel demand of transport a client with the 
supply of electrical vehicles, or hosts, so that the client find rides to their destinations in the shortest time 
possible to enhance passenger satisfaction. Meanwhile, the design of the human-agents for unexpected events 
handling and its dynamic route guidance. The perspectives of this research work on human-agents interaction 
involve three levels. Firstly, we construct a MACM&S with simulation mechanism that can quickly make a 
quality response and decision to environment to enhance management. Secondly, one of the perspectives of 
this work is to put forward a multi-agent design method for more interactive applications in the process 
control/command field. Finally, our current research concerns the study of the utility and performance 
assessment methods for such MACM&S.

1. Introduction 
 
   The research area of Multi-agent Based Computation Modelling and Simulation (MACM&S) continues to 
produce techniques, tools, and methods. In addition, a large number of applications of MACM&S have been 
developed. By MACM&S application we here mean actual computer simulations based on multi-agent based 
modelling of a real (or imagined) system in order to solve a concrete problem[1,2]. This research presents and 
discusses a model of a shared ride system is to developed with a view to as the decision analysis and support

2. Purpose 
 
The research projects within the MACM&S systems concern two different themes. On the one hand, 
models and methods are being developed to realize agents cooperate with each other to accomplish a certain 
shared rides goals. On the other hand, unexpected events management methods are studied to guarantee the 
execution of coordinated plans in dynamic situations. This multi-agent model allows testing different 
communication and way-finding strategies in peer-to-peer shared ride systems. The inheritance design of the 
model makes it easy to extend and suitable for other related investigations and further other research.  
 
3. Methods 
The general principle of MACM&S is the distribution of the problem, which in our study is human–agents 
interaction, into a certain number of cooperative entities which can communicate and coordinate their 
behavior in order to reach a common objective[8]. One of the advantages of the multi-agent approach to an 
interactive system concerns its ability to class the user as an agent belonging to the modeled system. The user 
interactions are therefore specified in the cooperating knowledge of each of the system’s software agents. In 
our architecture, we suggest using a division into three functional containers, which we have called, 
respectively: agent container, environment container, and scenario container (see figure 2). These three 
containers group together agents: 
 
Figure 2. The architecture of shared rides’ MACM&S system 
 
(1) The agent container, which have six kinds of agents: electric-taxis, control center, passengers, electric 
stations, road and stops. Agents are divided into two types. First type is active agents those have their own 
structures and behaviors. Second type is passive agents those only have their structures. The specification of 
each type of agent is as follows: 
(i) Passive Agents (PA): This category of agents represents entities that have a structure, without a behavior.

longest transverse thick-line). Electric-taxis those are in operation with electricity shortage ask electricity 
shortage information to control center and other electric-taxis those are in replenishing (step 4-1 and 4-2). The 
electric-taxis that are in replenishing and control center to other electric-taxis those are in operation (step 5-1 
and 5-2). And then electric-taxis those are in lack of electricity select a most suitable electricity station 
according evaluation criteria (step 6). After, electric-taxi moves to selected elected station (step 7). When 
electric-taxis enter in or leave the selected electricity station, the electricity station will update its’ state 
(busy/idle) (step 8-1 and 10-1). When electric-taxi arrives at electricity station, driver has to waiting for 
replenishing until there are no cars in front of him (step 8-2 and 9). Finally, after replenishing finished, 
electric-taxi will move to the closest stop and stand by for assignment (step10-2). 
 
 In this traffic jam management interactive spatial behaviors (Figure 5); there is one type of agents: 
Electric-taxis. The detail of behaviors is described as below: In the beginning user execute the simulation 
(step1). Immediately, simulation initial and generate two kind of actors (step 2-2 and 2-3), and simulation time 
is begin running and updating (step 2-1). During the simulation period, road will update its’ state (traffic jam/ 
freely flowing) (step 3). After generating and simulating for a while, electric-taxi can be divided into two kind 
of electric-taxis：Some electric-taxis are getting in traffic jam and others are moving freely (represented by the 
longest transverse thick-line). The electric-taxis those are getting in traffic jam send traffic jam information to 
each other and other electric-taxis those are not getting traffic jam (step 4-2, 4-3 and 4-4). When electric-taxis 
enter in or leave road, the state of road will be changed into jam-packed or uncrowded (step 4-1 and 6-1). 
When electric-taxi moves to a traffic jam road, driver will find another shortest path that excluded the traffic 
jam road (step 5 and 6-2). And then electric-taxi will switch into another road and move on (step 7). Finally, 
when electric-taxis that are leaving the traffic jam road, they will sending the traffic jam information again 
(step 8).

In our simulation, we use java language as our program language. Java is an object-oriented program 
language. That makes modeling of agent-based simulation become easier. And its’ flexibility makes it can 
operate in many different platforms (for example: Linux, Unix, Mac, Microsoft Windows and so on). That’s 
also its’ the biggest advantage. On the other hand, AnyLogic is a java-based simulation platform[9], it just 
match our need. So we chose AnyLogic as our simulation platform. According to the architecture in figure 2,

  This project has been correctly carried out according to its original proposal. Major
accomplishments include: 
 The goal of achieving highly flexible and adaptive behavior that would allow interface agents 
and humans to work effectively in shared rides problem situations. 
  The development of user interfaces, following the “Design-for-all” philosophy, oriented 
towards a multi-agent system interacting with an intelligent engine.. 
 The shared rides’ MACM&S system will be useful in determining whether the vehicles are 
servicing customers according to the generated schedule. It is also useful in emergency handling
and its dynamic route guidance. 
 The theoretical findings obtained in this project provide an important foundation for a systematic 
implementation of human-agents interface agents design. Three journal papers based on this related 
research have been published. The results of this work enable a systematic and easy implementation 
of a MACM&S system for emergency handling and its dynamic route guidance. They are of a high 
value in practical applications. Collaborations with and technology transferring to industries are 
greatly feasible.
