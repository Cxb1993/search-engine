2shafting technique. A large master motor is
usually required to drive all the loads
downstream and to cover various losses during
power transmission. Load impacts and external
disturbances of one axis may reflect to other
axes resulting unsatisfactory performance. In
addition, nonlinearities in the transmission
mechanisms can degrade the synchronization
precision. Finally, for effective long-distance
mechanical couplings, there are no general
solutions available.
By using the control strategies, these
synchronization problems can be alleviated in
general as long as special care is placed on the
closed loop stability problems. In this approach,
the motions of the driving and driven axis are
activated by electric motors, and the electric line
shafting is thus realized with the communication
technology. Since it transfers only information
not energy, the size of the master motor can be
much smaller. Disturbances in an axis can easily
be blocked locally, and individual controller in
each axis can thus be designed for effective
disturbance rejection. In addition, as long as the
communication channel is properly connected,
there will be no limitation in the distance of any
two synchronized axes.
Various designs have been reported in
recent years for motor synchronization
problems. Koren (1980) proposed the Cross
Coupled Technique for biaxial synchronization
problems in manufacturing systems. It detects
and corrects the synchronization error in
response to the torque load variation.
Perez-Pinal et. al. (2003) improved the
cross-coupled technique by the Relative
Coupling Strategy by including a speed relative
command between motors added to each
velocity signal to regulate the damping in each
motor. The Electronic Line-Shafting (Lorenz
and Schmidt 1989; Brandenburg et. al. 1999;
Valenzuela and Lorenz 2001; Anderson et. al.
2001; Perez-Pinal 2004) had been proved to be
able to replace mechanical line shaft effectively.
Most of these approaches above, however,
focused on linear systems without consideration
of system uncertainties. Few results can be
found for the analysis of closed-loop stability or
transient response bounds. In this project, we
consider the output synchronization problem of
two non-autonomous systems not restricted to
motors. The systems contain uncertainties and
disturbance, and FAT-based adaptive controllers
(Huang and Kuo 2001; Ge et. al. 2001; Spooner
et. al. 2002; Huang and Chen 2004a, 2004b;
Chen and Huang 2005; Huang and Liao 2006;
Chien and Huang 2007) are to be designed to
give proper performance. The closed-loop
stability is proved with the Lyapunov-like method,
and the transient response bounds are also
estimated. An experimental setup is designed and
built to justify the proposed strategy which shows
that it is effective to give good performance
compared with traditional designs.
2. Adaptive Control of Individual Motor
Suppose an electric motor under subject to
various external disturbances and internal
uncertainties can be modeled as a second order
non-autonomous system
)(),(),( tdutgtfx  xx (1)
where  Txx ][ x is the state vector andis
a subset in 2 denoting the set of feasible states.
The function  2:),( tf x is an uncertain
term and :)(td is the external
disturbance. Both of these two functions are
assumed to be time-varying without knowing
their variation bounds. The uncertain function
 2:),( tg x is to be bounded with
maxmin ),(0 gtgg  x (2)
where gmin and gmax are known constants. We are
required to design an adaptive controller
Uu such that the output x can track
the desired trajectory  ddx with good
performance regardless of the uncertainties and
disturbances. Let us represent (1) into the form
utgtfx ),(),( xx  (3)
where )(),(),( tdtftf  xx is a lumped
uncertainty, and consider the uncertainty model
for g(x,t) as ),(),( tggtg m xx  where minmax gggm 
is a nominal value for g andg is a time-varying
function satisfying

Define dxxe  as the tracking error, and
consider a feedback linearization based control
law
4tracking error can be proved to be u.u.b. In this
section, we are concerned with the output
synchronization of two motors. Intuitively, if
the two motors track an identical reference
trajectory, then the synchronization can be
indirectly achieved. Here, we would like to
follow the same concept but with the
consideration of the uncertainties and
disturbances in the systems.
Let 2][  iTiii xx x be the state
vector for the i-th motor, i=1 and 2, and the
system is modeled as the one in (1)

The tracking error for the i-th motor with

Then, by applying the controller law (5) and

Here, we see that each motor is exactly in the
form of (1), and hence we may use the design in
the previous section to complete the stability
analysis and transient performance evaluation.
5. Experimental Study
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed
control strategy, several experiments are
conducted. The system consists of two 60W DC
motors as shown in Figure 1. An eccentric load is
attached to the motor 2 to provide a time-varying
disturbance. A PIII-800MHz PC-compatible is
used to couple with the motors via the AD7541
D/A chip and the LM1875 amplifier. The
HCTL2032 chip is used to sample the encoder
pulses. The proposed controller and update laws
are implemented in a timer interrupt service
routine under 1KHz sampling rate under the
MS-DOS.
Three cases are considered here. In case 1,
both motors are controlled by PID without any
load dis- turbances. Case 2 is the same as case 1,
but with the load disturbance applied to motor 2.
Both motors are controlled by the proposed
strategy in case 3, and motor 2 is under the effect
of the disturbance. For all of these three cases,
the motors start from )0()0( 21 xx  T]00[ to
track a large-amplitude high-frequency trajectory
)2sin(8 txd  .
CASE 1: In this case, the motors are controlled
with the PID controller without load disturbances.
The gains are selected as
Motor1: 55.91 PK , 0002.01 IK , 50.551 DK .

中國控制研討會為中國境內年度最大的控制研討會。原先該研討會的參與者
只侷限於中國的學者，幾年前開始國際化後，近兩年的中國控制研討會已經完全
是國際研討會的樣貌了。今年的中國控制研討會係由北京技術學院(Beijing Institute
of Technology)主辦，所以舉辦地點設在北京市的國家會議中心。此國家會議中心
是中國最大、最新、最豪華的會議中心。其位於 2009年奧運園區內，緊鄰鳥巢運
動場以及水立方游泳館。此研討會的規模極大，每年都有數千篇的論文發表。由
於其審稿的嚴謹度已獲得肯定，所以自 2005年起已被收錄在 ISTP裡，2006年起
更被 IEEE的 Conference Publications Program收錄，2007年起則被 EI收錄！
搭乘華航直航北京班機，只需要三個小時整就可以飛抵北京首都機場。為迎
接奧運所建的新航廈，大得驚人，但是一切規劃得很有條理，所以入關手續走得
很便捷。而機場捷運更是方便，在二十分鐘內就直接到達北京市中心。北京的捷
運四通八達，只是乘客太多了，始終都很擁擠。
在三天的一般議程中，大會安排了許多國際知名學者進行 Keynote Speech。這
包括七月二十九日上午的 L. Ljung 教授的演講，其講題為”Approaches to
Identification of Nonlinear Systems”。Ljung教授是系統視別領域裡的大師級人物，
這個講題由他深入淺出的闡述，讓聽者領略到此一領域最前緣的研究概況，真是
不虛此行。另一場在七月三十日上午舉行的由 The University of Melbourne 的
Professor Iven Mareels所講的”Extremum Seeking–60 years of adaptive control”。由
於本講題與本人研究相關，所以聽得特別有收獲，其關點雖然未必全面，但是已
經很能涵蓋這些年來適應控制的梗概。這是此行中另一大滿足。R. Tempo教授在
七月三十日上午另有一場題為”Randommized Algorithms for Design of Uncertain
Complex Systems”亦頗為經典。這是近年來很新的一個研究焦點，Tempo教授的題
