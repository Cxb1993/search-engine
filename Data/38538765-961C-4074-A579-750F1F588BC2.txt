Abstract 
 
Furfural, a cellulose model species, was converted into gasoline-range fuels 
through catalytic fast pyrolysis. H-ZSM-5 based catalysts were employed in a 
continuous fixed bed system. The reaction temperature, contact time of reactant, and 
catalytic promoter are the key to manipulate product distribution. The onset of 
furfural conversion is decarbonylation to furan, followed by furan conversion to 
aromatics, coke, light olefins, and carbon oxides. At 500 oC, the highest yield of 
aromatics and the lowest amount of coke could be generated. A long contact time (~ 
1.5 s) also provided the highest aromatic selectivity. The promoter, zinc oxide, is 
proposed to be a hydrogen atom transfer; high aromatic yields with low 
hydrogen-containing byproducts, e.g. furan, were achieved by Zn promoted H-ZSM-5. 
This is attributed to the change of acid site concentration and newly formed Lewis 
acid site by anchored Zn ions. The mechanism of furfural conversion by pure and 
substituted H-ZSM-5 was thereby proposed.

omnivorous for different feedstocks.  
In comparison with catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and its derivatives, however, 
relatively fewer efforts have been dedicated to catalytic pyrolysis of furfural, 
especially under fast pyrolysis environment. The Dao group [35, 36] studied glucose 
related compounds, including furfural, over ZSM-5 based catalysts. The yields of 
hydrocarbon products were poor (less than 10%), with mostly furan and CO derived 
from furfural thermal decarboxylation. Grandmaison and collaborators [37] employed 
ZSM-5 in both furfural and furan conversion. The latter was found to be more stable 
than the former. Nevertheless, converting these furanic compounds showed low 
hydrocarbon yields with long contact times (more than 1000 seconds). Recently, 
furans conversion in both batch and continuous systems at short contact time was 
conducted by the Huber group [38-40]. More than 30% yield of aromatics can be 
achieved. They also demonstrated that by proper reaction environments and catalyst 
design, the product distributions can be manipulated.   
The objective of this paper is to investigate catalytic pyrolysis of furfural to 
gasoline-range fuels. The effects of reactant’s contact time, pyrolysis temperature, and 
catalytic promoter were studied. ZSM-5 based catalysts, including H-ZSM-5 and 
Zn/H-ZSM-5, were employed in a fixed bed system. Zinc cations were introduced 
into H-ZSM-5 because of their capability in hydrogen atom transfer, which is the key 
in aromatization [41-44]. This work presents that it is possible to adjust the product 
distribution by catalyst design and reaction environments in a continuous catalytic 
pyrolysis system. In addition, plausible mechanism of furfural pyrolysis was 
proposed.  
 
2. Experimental 
 
2.1. Material 
Furfural (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, 99%) was directly used without 
purification. ZSM-5 (Zeolyst, CBV 8014) with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 80 was calcined 
in air at 600 oC overnight prior to further treatments. H-ZSM-5 was synthesized by 
ion-exchange method using a 1.0 M solution of NH4NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich ACS reagent, 
99%) at 70 oC for 1 h. The residual was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 
100 oC for 10 h, and calcined at 600 oC overnight. The remaining powder was 
regarded as H-ZSM-5. Zn/H-ZSM-5 was prepared by incipient wetness method with a 
0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 solution. Approximately 0.5 and 1.5 wt% loading of Zn was used. 
The remaining paste was dried in air at 100 oC for 10 h then calcined at 550 oC 
overnight. All catalysts were sieved ranging from 150 to 200 (80mesh) μm before 
trials.

These condensed products were washed out for analysis using acetone as the solvent. 
Qualitative and quantitative analyses of gas and liquid products were performed using 
a GC/MS (Agilent 5890, DB-5MS capillary column, 60 m x 0.25 mm) and a GC 
TCD/FID equipped with a methanizer (SRI 8610, molecular sieve 13X and silica gel 
columns). Standards including benzene, toluene, phenol, furfural, p-xylene, 
benzofuran, naphthalene, and indene were injected into GC/MS; CH4, CO, CO2, 
ethylene, propylene, furan, benzene, toluene, and p-xylene were detected by GC 
TCD/FID. Due to the lack of standard reagent, the responses of methyl-naphthalene 
and methyl-indene were set equal to naphthalene and indene, respectively. Generated 
coke was determined by measuring the weight loss of post reaction catalyst using an 
elemental analyzer (EA, Perkin Elmer series II 2400). The sample was treated in a 
10% O2/He stream at 150 oC for 30 min, followed by a 10 oC/min heating rate to 600 
oC.  
 
2.4. Soluble coke analysis   
To identify the species preserved inside spent ZSM-5, a leaching method 
developed by Guisnet and Magnoux [46] was conducted. About 20 mg of used 
catalysts (H-ZSM-5 and 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5 in 500 oC) was soaked in 0.5 mL of 2% 
hydrofluoric acid at ambient temperature. After vigorous stirring for an hour, the 
sample was allowed to stand overnight. The soluble compounds were extracted by 
adding 0.5 mL methylene chloride in the solution. The organic phase was then 
analyzed by GC/MS.   
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1. Physicochemical properties of catalysts 
Figure 2 depicts the XRD patterns. Similar profiles were recorded for investigated 
catalysts. This indicates that the crystalline structure of ZSM-5 was intact after 
preparation. In addition, characteristic responses of ZnO were absent for 0.5 and 1.5% 
Zn/H-ZSM-5, suggesting Zn ions were well dispersed.  
Figure 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of freshly prepared catalysts. The peak 
position, acid site distribution, and the overall acid site amount were presented in 
Table 1. Two desorption peaks were indentified. Accordingly, these peaks can be 
classified into weak and strong chemisorbed ammonia. The low desorption 
temperature (Td) is associated with non-framework Lewis acid sites; the high Td is 
related to Brønsted acid sites on Si-O-Al groups. 
With increasing Zn loadings, the Td of Lewis acid site increased from 177 to 216 
oC. In contrast, the Td of Brønsted acid site decreased from 365 to 338 oC. This 
 8
Figure 5 shows the TPO signals of used H-ZSM-5 at 300, 400, and 500 oC, 
respectively. These profiles can be regarded as the combustion of deposited coke on 
the catalyst. According to Cheng and Huber [40], the TPO pattern contains 
combustion of both oxygenated and graphite-type coke. Therefore, we deconvoluted 
the TPO pattern through Gaussian peak fitting; two or three peaks were employed. 
The peak below 500 oC was regarded as oxygenated coke; beyond 500 oC, 
graphite-type coke. Table 2 summarizes the coke composition obtained by 
deconvolution of TPO. With increasing reaction temperature, more and more 
graphite-type coke could be formed. The visual observation also indicates that 
different forms of coke were generated: after used in 300 oC, the surface was dark red, 
which then turned light grey for post-reaction of 500 oC. This is in accord with earlier 
study [40], which shows the dark red color was the deposit of PAHs while the grey 
color is the graphite coke.   
 
3.3. Reactivity of Zn-promoted H-ZSM-5 
Figure 6 illustrates the product distribution of 0.5 and 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5. The 
reaction environments were set as those used for H-ZSM-5. Like the trend observed 
for H-ZSM-5, aromatic yields were enhanced with increasing temperature at 
WHSV=0.67 s-1. 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5 produced slightly higher aromatics (~5%) than 
0.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5. Compared to untainted H-ZSM-5, Zn-doped H-ZSM-5 catalysts 
yielded greater aromatics and olefins with less furan and coke under the same reaction 
platforms. Furan was completely consumed for 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5 at 500 oC, 
WHSV=0.67 s-1. 
The selectivity of aromatics revealed different outcomes compared to pure 
H-ZSM5. Although PAHs still dominated at low temperature, benzene and toluene 
showed different trends as those of H-ZSM-5: the former increased whereas the latter 
decreased with elevating temperatures.  
With decreasing contact time, aromatics and coke declined, and furan became the 
major product. In contrast to H-ZSM-5, ~10% aromatics can be generated by 1.5% 
Zn/H-ZSM-5 at the shortest contact time. Benzene and toluene, approximately in a 
2-to-1 ratio, are two major species with varying WHSV at 500 oC. 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5 
produced slightly higher benzene and lower toluene than 0.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5.  
Figures 7 and 8 display the TPO of post-reaction 0.5 and 1.5% Zn/H-ZSM-5; their 
position of peak, coke composition, and coke type were summarized in Tables 2 and 3, 
respectively. Peak positions for different type of cokes were similar for all catalysts. 
However, with increasing Zn loading, less and less graphite-type coke was formed 
compared to those of H-ZSM-5. For 1.5% ZN/H-ZSM-5, oxygenated coke became 
prominent species on its surface. At post-reaction of 500 oC sample, TPO response of 
 10
amount of zinc content, graphite-type coke could not be specified. This indicates that 
zinc ions play a significant role in aromatization of the intermediates inside ZSM-5 
pores; however, the activity of alkylation was suppressed. Different types of coke also 
suggests varying pathway for untainted and promoted H-ZSM-5.      
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Furfural can be converted into aromatics by catalytic fast pyrolysis over ZSM-5 
based catalysts. Reaction platforms and promoters are the key to manipulate the 
reaction pathway. Under low temperature, PAHs and oxygenated coke are favored; 
high temperature, mono-ring aromatics, light gases, and graphite-type coke. Zn-doped 
H-ZSM-5 can improve furan conversion, yielding greater benzene, carbon oxides, and 
alkenes than untainted H-ZSM-5. However, alkylation was inhibited by Zn 
substitution. This may be correlated to the varying acid sites of catalytic surface.
