Abstract 
This project studies and implements a high efficiency LiFePO4 battery charger. The modular design 
can satisfy the requirements of series/ parallel charging for electric vehicle applications. A CC-CC-CV 
charging scheme is also realized to meet the characteristics of LiFePO4 battery stacks. A 2kW laboratory 
prototype is built and tested. The experimental results are shown to verify the feasibility of the proposed 
scheme. 
Keywords: LiFePO4 Battery Charger, Series/Parallel Charging, CC-CC-CV, Bridgeless PFC. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The worldwide increase in demand for fossil fuels and the need to reduce the green house gas 
emissions has fostered the development in electric vehicle (EV) technology. Using electric energy for 
transportation applications will help reduce not only the green house gases but also the dependency on 
conventional fossil fuels [1-4]. The increasing popularity of electric vehicles is presenting the automotive 
industry with new challenges. One key problem is the operational mileage range in one charge of battery, a 
major energy-storage component in the electric vehicles. Battery characteristics such as lifetime, energy 
density, charging time, and cost are still encumbering its commercial application. For traditional batteries, 
such as Lead-acid batteries used in many applications where cost is more important than space and weight, 
the energy density is too low to meet the energy requirements when vehicles accelerate, decelerate and 
battery charger for electric vehicle applications. The studied battery charger can be series-connected or 
parallel-connected to satisfy the requirement of high-voltage and high-power operation. Voltage balancing 
and current sharing among battery stacks can be achieved by the developed charging scheme. 
 
Figure 1 LiFePO4 Battery Charger 
I. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
Figure 2 shows a series-charging configuration for the LiFePO4 battery stacks in high-voltage output 
applications. Each charger module can individually charge the corresponding low-voltage battery stack 
connected in series with the others. Because high-voltage devices are not necessary at the output-side of 
the studied battery charger, low circuit cost and high system reliability can be achieved. Figures 3(a) and 
3(b) show two parallel-charging configurations for the LiFePO4 battery stacks in high-current output 
applications. In Figure 3(a), each charger module can individually charge the corresponding battery stack 
connected in parallel with the others. The studied charger modules also can charge the identical battery 
stack with high energy capacity.

II. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
In this study, a constant-current→ constant-current→ constant-voltage (CC-CC-CV) charging scheme 
shown in Figure 5(a) is designed for LiFePO4 batteries. The requirements for long battery lifetime, fast 
charging speed and simple control can be satisfied. Charging starts by checking the initial battery voltage. 
If it is below a threshold voltage (VT), charging with a low current (IB1) will sustain to avoid the 
occurrence of over-temperature due to high battery impedance. If the battery voltage reaches VT, a fast 
charging current (IB2) will be applied until the upper voltage limit (VS) is reached. Then, CV mode starts 
until either the charging current drops to a threshold value. Figure 5(b) shows a control circuit design for 
the studied charging scheme. A current-sensing resistor Rsense is series-connected with the battery stack to 
sense the charging current Ib. A current-error-amplifier (CEA) with voltage-gain KCEA is used to keep a 
constant low-current IB1 as Equation (1) output before the battery voltage reaches to a given value VT as 
Equation (2). It can be observed that sampling resistors R3, R4 and comparator (COM) are used to 
determine whether shunt transistor (Q) should be turned-on. As long as the battery voltage reaches to a 
given value VT, a fast charging current IB2 as Equation (3) is applied. Sampling resistors R8 and R9 are 
used to determine whether the upper voltage limit (VS) as Equation (4) is reached. A 
voltage-error-amplifier (VEA1) in the phase-shift control IC is used to realize the constant-voltage control 
to prevent battery over-charging.

zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) DC-DC converter with current-doubler shown in Figure 8 is designed to 
achieve high conversion efficiency and wide-range of well-regulated output [17-20]. By using the charging 
control circuit shown in Figure 5(a), voltage balancing and current sharing among battery stacks connected 
in parallel/ series can be achieved.

Figure 9(a) shows the measured waveforms for AC input current and voltage. It can be observed that 
a sinusoidal input current in phase with AC line voltage can be achieved. Soft-switching waveforms of the 
phase-shifted full-bridge DC-DC converter are measured and shown in Figure 9(b). As shown in Table 3, 
high efficiency performance can be achieved by the zero-voltage turn-on features on the primary switches. 
Figure 10(a) shows the measured charge I/V curve for the 86V/18Ah LiFePO4 battery pack. When the 
battery voltage is below the threshold voltage of 78V, a low charging current of 3.6A (about 0.2C) is 
sustained. As the battery voltage reaches 78V, a charging current of 18A (1C) is applied until the battery 
voltage reaches to 86V. Then, CV mode starts and the battery charging current rapidly drops with an 
exponential profile to prevent overcharging. Figures 10(b) and 10(c) respectively show the series and 
parallel charging waveforms. By using the studied battery charger, voltage-balancing and current-sharing 
features during charging process can be achieved.
