Abstract 
This research is engaged in the new synthesis 
methods of parallel-coupled microstrip bandpass 
filters (PCBPFs) with accurate bandwidths and the 
Chebyshev responses. The proposed filters are 
synthesized based on insertion loss (IL) function 
derived by converting the composite ABCD matrices 
of all coupled stages. The synthesis improves 
prediction of circuit bandwidth. Simultaneous 
equations for Chebyshev filters of order N ≤ 9 are 
derived for determining geometric parameters of the 
coupled stages. Emphasis is also placed on trade-off 
between fractional bandwidth Δ and ripple level R. 
For circuits with N ≥ 4, the passband response is 
specified by a maximal in-band ripple level. One 
filter with R = 0.1 dB and Δ = 40 % and the other 
filter with R = 0.04 dB and Δ = 40 % are fabricated 
and measured. The results show very good 
agreement with theoretical prediction. 
 
Keyword: Chebyshev response, filter synthesis, 
insertion loss function, parallel-coupled line filter, 
tapped line. 
 
II. Introduction 
The parallel-coupled configuration has been 
widely used for realization of microstrip bandpass 
filters (BPFs) [1]-[4]. Approximate equations are 
well documented for determining dimensions of the 
coupled stages [3]-[4]. Based on these equations, 
BPFs will have a bandwidth (BW) less than 
specification, and the BW decrement deteriorates as 
filter order or design BW is increased [5]. 
Various methods have been proposed for 
designing microwave filters with accurate passband 
responses. For example, the Q distribution method [6] 
provides accurate design solutions to 
quarter-wavelength-coupled filters, and the insertion 
loss (IL) functions are derived for filters with 
short-circuited quarter-wave stubs [7] and filters in 
the parallel- coupled configuration [8]. 
Note that the BPFs synthesized in [6]-[8] are 
limited to maximally flat responses. Chebyshev 
filters have more design flexibility than the 
maximally flat type due to the degree of freedom in

 In 5(c), QT is the total Q (quality factor) of the filter 
and θm is the electrical length of each coupled stage 
at either passband edge. It is important to note that a 
variable k is purposely introduced to (5a). It provides 
an extra freedom in matching coefficients in (5a) 
with (3) and preserves the specified Chebyshev 
response at the same time. 
Substituting N = 2 into (3), the IL function 
becomes

The term [T2(x)]2 will provide an equal-ripple 
response in the passband, and its coefficient 
[2T12T2ksinθ]–1 not only defines the ripple level but 
also implies a transmission zero at 2fo where θ = π. 
Note that in (7) there are five unknowns, i.e., k, S1, S2, 
T1, and T2, to be determined. By imposing the given 
ripple level to (8), the system has four conditions and 
there is one degree of freedom in choosing the 
solution. If in (5a) the variable k is not introduced, 
however, the system will be fully determined. 
B. Filters of Order N ≤ 9: 
When N is large, the derivation and expression for 
each matrix entry can be long and tedious. One can 
utilize the structural symmetry to reduce the 
numbers of variables and algebraic matrix 
multiplication. The simultaneous conditions for 
solving Si and Ti can be established by matching 
coefficients of the cosnθ terms of the IL function with 
those of TN(x). Here, we derive the IL functions for 
filters of order N ≤ 9, and the results are

when 2 ≤ N ≤ 9. The Chebyshev conditions are listed 
in Table I. It is found that S1 = 2 for each N. Note that 
total number of unknowns Si and Ti for an N-order 
filter is N+1 for odd N and N+2 for even N. The 
number of conditions, including the specified ripple 
level, is less than that of unknowns when N ≥ 4. In 
addition, the variable k introduces an extra degree of 
freedom in matching the coefficients of the power 
series. Thus, the degrees of freedom for N ≤ 9 are 
[N/2], an integer by truncating N/2. This 
under-determined feature is very useful for circuit 
realization and will be addressed in Section IV. 
As in (10), the equal-ripple characteristic is 
completely specified by the Chebyshev polynomial. 
The extra frequency- dependent term 1/sinθ  will 
then alter the specified ripple level R to a certain 
extent. To tackle this, a method for correcting R will 
be formulated for N ≤ 3 and a strategy for reducing 
the fluctuation of R will be investigated for N ≥ 4. 
C. Ripple Level Specified by θm: 
For the second-order filter in (8), the ripple level 
can be obtained by evaluating the IL function at θ =

respectively, smaller than the theoretical design. In 
measurement, in-band IL is 0.7 dB. Photograph of 
the fabricated circuit is in Fig. 7(b).  
2)Filter β (N = 7, Δ = 40 %, R = 0.04 dB):  
When N = 7, eight variables have to be 
determined. From d/dx(T7(x)) = 0, we have θd = 
cos−1 (0.901×cosθm). There are three degrees of 
freedom for choosing the solutions. We take k, S3 
and T1 as sweep variables to solve the simultaneous 
equations. The possible roots for S2, T2, S3, T3, S4 
and T4 with respect to T1 are plotted in Fig. 8 with k 
= 0.5. Fig. 9 plots the root loci for Zoo and Zoe of the 
second, third and fourth stages with Zo = 50 Ω. Each 
end stage with Zoe1 = 87.83 Ω and Zoo1 = 12.18 Ω is 
replaced by a tapped section with Z1 = 37.8 Ω. As 
shown in Fig. 10(a), the simulated and measured 
results match very well with the theoretical 
prediction. Detailed data show that both simulated 
and measured responses have Δ = 38.5 % and 37.3 
%, respectively. The circuit photograph is in Fig.

V.  Conclusions 
Parallel-coupled line filters with Chebyshev 
responses for order up to nine are directly 
synthesized based on derived insertion loss 
functions. Simultaneous equations and the ripple 
level condition are formulated and tabulated for 
determining geometric dimensions of each coupled 
stage. The ripple level condition can be modified to 
recover the error resulted from the 1/sinθ term in the 
derived Chebyshev expressions for the particular 
parallel-coupled configuration. When filter order N 
≥ 4, the in-band peak ripple levels of the synthesized 
filters have a small fluctuation. The fluctuation is 
negligible when the designated ripple level or the 
bandwidth is small. Two circuits are fabricated and 
measured to validate the formulation. All measured

本計畫所發展之合成理論具有原創性，相當適合在國際學術期刊發表，目前
準備將部分研究成果撰寫為論文投稿。從國際著名期刊持續刊登此類論文而
言，後續仍有大幅研究的空間。而本計畫所採用之平行耦合微帶線濾波器架
構亦非常實用與普遍，符合 RF 業界的需求，相信必會引起學界與業界的注
意與採用。 
 
 
二、本計畫之相關研究： 
 
在此感謝國科會所提供之研究補助，對於本案間接相關之濾波器性能提
升研究亦有重有助益。由於現代通訊系統中的濾波器要求具備很寬的截止頻
帶（Wide stopband），因此如何消除或壓抑虛假響應也是近幾年來國際性文
獻上所熱切討論的議題之一。在執行本案同時，我們也針對微波共振腔新構
型進行研究，提出以開迴圈微帶線共振腔來實現具有虛假響應抑制能力之微
波帶通濾波器，希望能同時縮小濾波器尺寸及盡量延伸帶通濾波器上截止頻
帶的寬度，以提高濾波器的性能。初步研究成果已發表於著名之 IEEE 
Microwave and Wireless Components Letters上，請參考
