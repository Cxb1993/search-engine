The differential characteristic impedance of an isolated differential pair is [10] 
 
               (1) 
where k is the coupling coefficient between two traces. Figure 3 demonstrates the distributed 
equivalent circuit of a single differential pair, which ignores the dielectric and conductor loss. 
The term L11 represents self inductance, C1g is the capacitance between the conductor and ground 
plane, Ch specifies the packaging parasitic capacitance, and C12 and k stand for the mutual 
capacitance and coupling coefficient between the two traces of a differential pair, respectively. 
This study uses the transmission line theory [11] and curve-fitting method to establish the 
relationship between the structure’s parameters and its equivalent circuit model. For an isolated 
differential pair, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), Table I summarizes the extracted parameters of the 
equivalent circuit model. With L11, C1g, C12, and k, the differential impedance Zdiff is calculated 
and also demonstrated in Table I. As Table I shows, the distance (S) between the traces of a 
differential pair is in inverse proportion to the coupling coefficient k and mutual capacitance C12, 
but in proportion to Zdiff.

By definition [10], the differential characteristic impedance of a vertical coupling structure is  
 
                (4) 
In a typical structure, as summarized in Table II, the km2 is larger than km1. By this equation, the 
differential characteristic impedance Zdiff_v is larger than that of a single differential pair.  
The following is an analysis of the horizontal coupled structure. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the 
relations between voltage and current are as follows 
 
 
   
                                                              (5)

In the same way, the differential characteristic impedance Zdiff_h of a horizontal coupled 
differential pair is represented as 
 
                  (6) 
 
When km3 is smaller than (km1+km2)/2, as shown in Table III, the differential characteristic 
impedance of horizontal coupled pairs is smaller than that of a single differential pair. Tables II 
and III illustrate that all km and Cm are in inverse proportion to Q and H. Therefore, the 
differential characteristic impedance in the edge-coupled double loop design can be optimized by 
tuning S, Q, and H.

To support high-speed differential signal transmission, the impedance matching should be 
improved. By using the simulator, a differential signal is injected form L1 travels up to L6 through 
the inner pairs, and finally travels down through the outer pairs. As depicted in Fig. 9, Ln 
represents the layer number, and the subscripts i and o correspond to inner- and outer pair, 
respectively. As we can see in this time domain figure, the differential-mode impedance from 0.2 
ns to 0.317 ns exhibits maximum discrepancy to the target of 90 ohm. By calculating the signal’s 
propagating velocity, the corresponding structure is located at the top layer L6. This is because 
when the injected differential signal propagates through this region, the dominant coupling 
structure is only horizontal. As expressed in Table III, a negative [km3-(km1+km2)/2] of (6) results in 
a low differential-mode characteristic impedance.

 Based on the previous structural analysis, two methods can be applied to improve the 
differential-mode impedance. In method 1, according to (4) and the parameters in Table II, the 
thickness between L5 and L6 is reduced from 150 μm to 30 μm. The value of (km2-km1) in (4) 
increases from 0.02 to 0.11. As Fig. 10 indicates, this method increases the impedance from 30

Conclusion 
To meet the sequential printing requirements of the via-less wet process, an edge-coupled 
common-mode filter is designed in this study. We then propose two methods to improve the 
impedance matching of this double loop common-mode filter. The controlled coupling 
coefficients of differential pairs demonstrate the efficiency of improving impedance mismatching. 
In method 1, decreasing the substrate thickness between L5 and L6 increases the differential 
characteristic impedance from 30 Ohm to 60 Ohm. In method 2, increasing the space between the 
differential pair on L6 increases the impedance from 60 Ohm to target of 90 Ohm. Using both 
methods, the reflection coefficient of -10 dB increases from 3.3 GHz to 6 GHz. As a result, we 
are able to improve the insertion loss and optimize the via-less edge-coupled design.

Abstract—In demand of high-speed differential data 
communication, the common mode filter is usually presented. 
The new common mode filter demonstrated in this paper is 
designed by edge-coupled differential pairs. By using double 
loops routing structure, the coupling inductance is increased. To 
achieve sufficient common mode noise suppression while 
introducing minimal signal insertion loss, the full-wave time 
domain EM simulator is applied. 
 
Keywords—Common mode filter, differential signal, multi-layer. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, science and technology have grown quickly and 
applications for high-speed data rates are required. The speed 
of data rates is directly proportionate to the bandwidth and 
carrier frequency. Therefore, with the increasing customer 
demand for high-speed data rates, more unwanted 
electromagnetic interference is introduced and interferes 
signal integrity [1-2]. 
Since the differential signal is referenced to itself, it has 
the advantage of common mode noise suppression [3]. But, 
the differential pair has the disadvantage that the routing area 
is twice as big as the single end transmission line. Also, when 
the differential signal is imbalanced in phase or amplitude, the 
common mode current will introduce on itself [4]. This 
common mode current is the dominant source of radiated 
emission at high frequencies [5-6]. 
II. 3-D MULTI-LAYER DESIGN 
In this paper, the common mode filter is designed to 
achieve sufficient common mode current suppression by 
multilayer ceramic process. In order to increase the common 
mode impedance, this common mode filter is composed of an 
edge-coupled differential pair, as shown in Fig. 1. The filter 
has a ceramic substrate with relative permeability 1, relative 
permittivity 4.8, and dielectric loss tangent 0.0016. The 
conductor is silver. We used full-wave time domain EM 
simulator to improve the impedance matching. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Structure of edge-coupled differential pair 
 
Fig. 2 shows an initial common mode filter made of multi-
layer ceramic process. The differential impedance of the 
single differential pair is Zdiff = 2Z0(1-k) [7], and it is 
decreased when the coupling coefficient k between the 
differential pair is increased.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Structure of multi-layer common-mode filter 
 
The equivalent lumped circuit of the single differential pair 
is demonstrated in Fig. 3, which ignores the dielectric and 
wiring loss. L11 represents self inductance, C1g is the 
capacitance between conductor and ground plane, C12 and k 
stand for the mutual capacitance and mutual coupling 
coefficient between the traces of the differential pair. Table I 
summarizes the extracted parameters of the equivalent circuit 
model with the single differential pair. As depicted in Table I, 
the coupling coefficient k [8] and mutual capacitance C12 are 
in inverse proportion to the distance of the traces of the 
differential pair.

III. CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE IMPROVEMENT 
Fig. 6 shows the structure of the multi-layer common 
mode filter. The positive signal propagates on the gray line 
and another one is negative. This common mode filter has six 
layers and there are two loops from L2 to L5, which are 
divided into inter- and outer traces. Fig. 7 shows the 
simulation S parameters of the common mode filter. This edge 
coupled filter provides better than 10 dB common mode 
attenuation Scc21 [10-11] over the frequency range from 0.515 
to 2.37 GHz, low differential mode insertion loss of Sdd21 > -2 
dB up to 2.9 GHz, and differential mode matching with Sdd11 < 
-10 dB only up to 3.325 GHz [12].  
To further improve the bandwidth of this common mode 
filter, the differential mode characteristic impedance is 
simulated in time domain as demonstrated in Fig. 8. The 
differential signal passes through this filter from inner-circle 
to outer-circle. Ln represents the number of the layer; i and o 
correspond to inter- and outer differential loop respectively. 
The differential mode impedance from 0.2 ns to 0.317 ns has 
maximum difference to the target of 90 ohm. It locates at L5’s 
inner left side circle and L6 as depicted in Fig. 6. The reason 
is that L6 and inner left side circle of L5 are not as coupled as 
upper- and under differential pairs as the middle layers are. In 
equation (3) the (km2-km1) is lower, and the differential mode 
impedance is directly proportionate to it. So, the differential 
mode impedance can be increased by improving k, km1 and km2.

Fig. 8. Simulation of TDR 
 
By using the three fundamental structures analysis of 
differential pairs, two methods are applied to improve the 
differential mode impedance. In case 1, as shown in Fig. 9 (a), 
the thickness between L5 and L6 is reduced to the process 
limit, first. The value of (km2-km1) is increased from 0.02 up to 
0.14, as the illustration of Fig. 10 shows, which increases the 
impedance from 30 ohm to 60 ohm. Case 2 is the increased 
space between differential pair and decreased the value of 
coupling coefficient k of L6 as demonstrated in Fig. 9 (b). The 
impedance is increased from 60 Ohm to 90 Ohm as depicted 
in Fig. 11. The TDR comparison between initial and improved 
structures is shown in Fig. 12. The impedance of the original 
designed structure is the worst with about 30 Ohm at 0.3 ns. 
However, after using these two methods to improve the 
coupling coefficients, the impedance is increased to 90 Ohm.

The impedance is increased from 60 Ohm up to 90 Ohm. 
Through the two methods, the bandwidth of -10 dB is 
increased from 3.325 GHz up to 6 GHz. As the result, we 
improve impedance mismatching to optimize the design by 
using time domain method of common mode filter structure.
