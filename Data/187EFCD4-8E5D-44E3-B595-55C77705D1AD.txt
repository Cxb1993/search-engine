relatively high homologous temperature (T/Tm) for the Ni1-xO/NiAl2O4,2 and Co1-
xO/Y-PSZ composites3 resulted in a faster orientation change and more significant 
coalescence of the particles than the Ni1-xO/Y-PSZ composite at a specified annealing 
temperature of 1600oC.1  Reorientation of the intragranular particles in these 
composites has little to do with sintering,4 diffusion induced recrystallization5 or 
dynamic recrystallization,6 but can be reasonably explained by rotation of the 
particles above a critical temperature for anchorage release at the interface with 
respect to the host grain.1-3 
 
In such a thermally activated rotation process of the intragranular particles, 
Brownian motion of the particles in terms of interfacial diffusion of atoms was 
suggested to happen1-3 as for the case of f.c.c. metal crystallites migrating and rotating 
on single crystal substrate, KCl(100) with or without steps.7-12  The size and 
temperature dependence of diffusivity of the crystallites has been measured over 
KCl(100)7 and found to be in accordance with Brownian-type motion of the 
crystallites in terms of interfacial diffusion of atoms from leading edge to trailing edge 
of the crystallites.  Einstein's molecular theory of heat,13 Eyring's transition-state 
model14 and frictional force at a viscous interface were thus adopted to formulate the 
diffusivity equation of the crystallite over the single crystal substrate.8-10  The size 
dependence of orientation change of intragranular particles was also verified by 
annealing experiments for the case of Co1-xO particles in Y-PSZ grain.3 
 
Recently, oxidation-decomposition facilitated Brownian rotation of crystallites in 
the (NimCo1-m)1-δO polycrystals was studied.15  We further showed here that Brownian 
rotation of compound ZrTiO4 particles readily occurred during their reactive sintering 
and incorporation into Zr-dissolved rutile grains until the two phases reached specific 
crystallographic relationship with a beneficial low interfacial energy. 
 
2. Experimental 
Powders of reagent grade ZrO2 (Cerac, 99.9%, 3 µm in size) and TiO2 (Aldrich, 
99.9%, 5 µm in size) in 1:4 molar ratio (denoted as Z20T80) were mixed by a 
magnetic stirrer in ethanol at 50oC for 2 h.  The slurry was dried in an oven at 70oC 
and ground with an agate mortar and pestle.  The specimens were dry-pressed at 650 
MPa to form pellets ca. 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness.  The dry-pressed 
pellets were reactively sintered at 1600oC for 0.5 to 36 h, in air and then air-quenched 
or furnace cooled to room temperature.  For a better understanding of the reactions of 
phases, the pellets were also fired at 1400 or 1500oC for 1 h in air and then air 
quenched.  The fired specimens were polished by SiC sand paper and then diamond 
paste, followed by thermally etching to reveal grain boundaries of the sintered 
composites. 
 
X-ray diffraction (XRD, CuKα, 40 kV, 30 mA) and least-squares refinement of 
the d-spacings were used to determine the lattice parameters of the ZrTiO4 and Zr-
dissolved TiO2 in the fired composites.  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-
6400, 20 kV) was used to study the size and distribution of the phases in the sintered 
grains.  Thin sections of the fired samples were Ar-ion milled to electron transparency 
and studied by analytical electron microscopy (AEM, JEOL 3010) at 300 kV.  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed for selected area electron 
diffraction (SAED) pattern, bright field image (BFI), dark field image (DFI) 
observations of the ZrTiO4 particles embedded in the Zr-dissolved TiO2 grains.  
The incipient exsolution of ZrTiO4 particle was hardly prevented during furnace 
cooling, although the precipitation of ZrTi2O6 and the high to low-temperature 
transformation of zirconium titanate is very sluggish.18  In fact, diffuse diffraction 
streaks along [011] direction were always observed for the ZrTiO4 particles as 
represented by an intergranular one in [011] zone axis for the sample fired at 1600oC 
for 36 h and then cooled in the furnace (Fig. 6). 
 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Reorientation of embedded nonepitaxial ZrTiO4 particles in the composites 
Analogous to the high-temperature dynamics of Y-PSZ particles in Co1-xO 
grains,19 the size-dependent orientation change of the ZrTiO4 particles in Zr-dissolved 
rutile grain can be rationalized by a Brownian-type rotation of the particles in terms of 
anchorage release (i.e. debonding) at the ZrTiO4/rutile interface.  The diffusion 
coefficient (D) of spherical particles confined in a grain was formulated to decrease 
exponentially with the increase of number of atoms in anchorage (i.e. atoms in good 
coherency) at the interface, whereas increase exponentially with ∆T above a critical 
temperature (To) for anchorage release:3 
D=2a2(kT/h)exp(∆So/R)exp(-∆Ho/RT)exp(-πd2∆hm/a2R)(1/T-1/To)      (I) 
where πd2/a2 is the number of atoms in anchorage (assuming crystallite as a sphere of 
diameter d), a the periodic distance of an atom, ∆Go (=∆Ho -T∆So) for viscous motion 
in terms of atom diffusion along the interface, ∆hm the latent enthalpy to untie an atom 
from the interface, h the Planck constant and other symbols have their usual meanings. 
 
Due to the capillarity effect, To as well as the free energy is in fact a function of 
the particle size. Thus, the reasons that a smaller particle has a higher diffusivity are 
two-fold: firstly, a smaller number of atoms in anchorage at the interface; secondly, a 
lower To.  A range of To, corresponding to a specific size range of the particles, is thus 
expected.  Above To, the migration-rotation of a crystallite is determined by the 
“viscous” diffusion along interphase interface, rather than debonding at the interface.  
The activation energy of such a “viscous” motion is independent of particle size. 
However, To must be reached before the particle can move under a frictional force, 
due to interfacial viscosity.8,9,12  Under such circumstances, the diffusivity of the 
particles was derived from I as:20 
D=2a2(kT/h)exp(∆So/R)exp(-∆Ho/RT)                                (II) 
The so-called nanophase effect commonly refers to dominant surface energy 
contribution and related properties in the range 1-100 nm.21  The nanophase effect 
does not apply to the present case of ZrTiO4 particles because they were much larger 
than 100 nm in size.  In any case, the critical temperature To for anchorage release at 
the ZrTiO4/rutile interface should be lower than 1600oC in order to activate the 
Brownian motion of the embedded particles in the solid state.  This is justified by a 
high homologous temperature (T/Tm= 0.92) at 1873 K, given the eutectic temperature 
2033 K for the binary ZrO2-TiO2 system.22 
 
A considerable amount of vacancies due to interdiffusion of atoms across the 
interface is expected to benefit the anchorage release at the interface, hence facilitates 
particle rotation for the ZrTiO4/rutile composite.  This vacancy effect on debonding of 
atoms at interface can be further enhanced when there is considerable net vacancies 
flux to form Kirkendall pores under the constraint of equilibrium solid solubility at 
the interface.  (The mutual solid solubility is about ca.15 at. % Zr in rutile and ca. 3 at. 
local maximum relative to a small rotation to either side of the symmetric operation 
for lower interface energy.  In the present composites fabricated by reactive sintering 
at high temperatures, the mixed strain effect is expected to vary with complicated 
interdiffusion at the scale of individual ZrTiO4 and rutile grains and may therefore 
select metastable epitaxy route in Fig. 4.  As shown by the stereographic projections 
(Fig. 8), this relation is allowed to change into the primary crystallographic 
relationship by rotation within ca. 17.93o, either clockwise or counterclockwise, about 
α]010[ / r]110[  pole until the (101)α and (211)r planes are superimposed.  Since the 
(010) plane appeared to be vague for this epitaxial ZrTiO4 particle (Fig. 4) it is by no 
means clear, whether such a rotation over (010)α really occurred. 
 
5. Conclusions 
1. ZrTiO4/rutile composites were fabricated by reactive sintering of ZrO2 and TiO2 
powders (1:4 molar ratio) at 1400 to 1600oC in air. 
2. Upon firing at 1600oC (homologous temperature = 0.92) in air, the ZrTiO4 
particles (subscript α) became lath-like in Zr-dissolved rutile grains (subscript r) 
following the epitaxy relationship α]010[ // r]110[ ; (001)α //(011)r. 
3. This relationship is the same as the natural TiO2 polymorphs, though with a well-
developed (101)α/(211)r interface rather than a better oxygen-matched 
(001)α/(011)r interface. 
4. The reorientation of the embedded ZrTiO4 particles can be rationalized by 
reactive-sintering facilitated Brownian rotation of the particles until energetically 
favorable interface state is reached under the combined influences of lattice 
mismatch, Coulumbic interactions and mixed strain effect.
