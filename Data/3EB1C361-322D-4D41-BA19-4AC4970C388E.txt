Gabor wavelet, which offers the ability for multi-channel and 
multi-resolution analysis [5] [7], is used to effectively evaluate 
the topographical features which are representative of different 
age groups. The topography data obtained are used to process 
age synthesis on the test images. Results are compared for the 
conventional ASM algorithm and proposed integrated ASM 
algorithm. The manipulated target images are evaluated against 
reference [5] to ensure satisfactory results. The auto alignment 
process developed in the proposed system saves time by 
eliminating the need to perform manual alignments, and it also 
reduces learning time required for personnel training.  
II. METHODOLOGY 
A.  ASM Algorithm 
The Active Shape Model (ASM) algorithm was proposed 
by Cootes and Taylor [8] in 2000 to cut and divide images, 
including facial images. Its common applications include 
pattern recognition systems and object tracking systems which 
analyze rigid objects or objects with similar features, such as 
human faces and palms. The ASM algorithm is often used to 
extract the outlines and patterns of target objects for the 
purpose of evaluation and comparison during image post 
processing. 
To generate the ASM model in this system, sets of features 
must be defined which are then used to describe the shape of 
the target object. Through the use of statistical analysis, the 
ASM model can be constructed to analyze the shape described 
by the feature sets. There are certain steps required to build the 
ASM model, including sample selection, landmark 
configuration, alignment training and model calculation. 
During the sample selection process, which in this case is for 
the purpose of face recognition, it is required that the images 
should only contain human faces and that any non-facial 
features be removed in order for the system to maintain 
accuracy. The ASM algorithm does not directly take test 
images as sample images; rather, it sets landmarks or 
important features on the test images. To minimize errors 
during age synthesis, alignments are performed during the 
training set where images are normalized before executing 
final evaluations of the skin topographies. In the model, the 
mean value, covariance of the training set, and the eigenvector 
and corresponding eigenvalue of the covariance are calculated.  
For the ASM model to recognize the reference image, the 
shape of the face in the image should first be identified. For 
example, in the reference image, k grayscale pixels are 
selected from inside of the recognized shape, and k grayscale 
pixels are selected from outside of the recognized shape. In the 
end, 2k+1 pixels form a grayscale vector. To minimize the 
influence of light settings and other environmental effects on 
the images, each grayscale vectors is normalized using the 
following equation: 
( )111 i
jii
v
v
v
∑
=        
where i is the ith sample, and j is jth entry in the grayscale 
vector vij. Then the mean value v¯ and covariance Sv are both 
calculated. As the test image is input into the system, the ASM 
model extracts 2k+1 pixels from the image and calculates the 
Mahalanobis distance between the reference image and the test 
image, as defined by the following equation: 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )21 ννννν ν −−= −Τ sss Sf   
where T is the transpose matrix. This step should be performed 
using iterative calculation until the smallest value of f (vs) is 
found. The final result defines the shape of the test image. 
B. Log-Gabor Wavelet 
In face recognition studies, usually the size of the face, 
skin surface topography and facial features are used as 
baselines. The Gabor wavelet is mainly used in face 
recognition systems to capture frequency information from 
facial features [5][7][9][10][11]. The Gabor wavelet employs 
multi-channel and multi-layer methods to capture facial 
features while simultaneously effectively identifying skin 
surface topographies of different frequencies on human faces. 
It can also be used in classifying facial expressions [9][10]. 
Gabor Wavelet is defined as: 
   ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )3,,,,, yxwfsyxfg θ=θ   
where ( )θ,fs  represents a complex sinusoidal wave, and ( )yxw ,  represents a second order Gaussian-shaped function. 
The Gabor wavelet has two main limitations, namely that 
its bandwidth is limited to approximately one octave, and that 
search time for larger images is extensive. Field [7] proposed 
the Log-Gabor wavelet method to overcome these limitations.      
The advantage of the Log-Gabor wavelet is that the DC 
components are removed, and the frequency can be extended 
into a wider range. 
In the frequency domain, a second order Gaussian-shaped 
function can be regarded as a logarithmic frequency value. A 
second order Log-Gabor wavelet can be represented in polar 
coordinates [9][10] as: 
             ( ) ( )4, θθ HHfH f ×=
                                                              
where Hf determines the radial components in different 
bandwidth, and Hθ determines the angular components for 
filters in different spatial directions. Equation (4) can also be 
represented as:

In Figure 6, the purple line defines the length between two 
inner corners of the eyes for the testing subject, and the green 
line is the length between two inner corners of the eyes for the 
reference subject. The image of the reference subject is 
zoomed and resized so the length of the green line is reduced 
to the same length as that of the purple line. The red line in the 
resultant image has the same length as the purple line and the 
adjustment is successfully achieved. 
Mathematically, the locations of the two inner eye corners 
of the test and reference images are respectively represented 
by landmarks PA75 [42] and PA75 [37], and landmarks PB75 [42] 
and PB75 [37], where the 42nd landmark is the left inner eye 
corner and the 37th landmark is the right inner eye corner. The 
distances between these points are calculated as Dx1 and Dx2 
and the resizing ratio ScaleWH is obtained as follows:

Once again following the concept of geometric invariance, the

right side of the nose, the 52nd landmark is the left side of the 
nose, and the 15th landmark is the bottom of the chin. The 
distances between the noses and the chins are calculated as Hy1 
and Hy2 and the resizing ratio ScaleH is obtained as follows:

IV. RESULTS AND VERIFICATION 
 During normalization of the images, the ASM algorithm 
is employed to identify facial areas and to calculate the 
locations of important facial features. In the proposed system 
with integrated ASM algorithm and Log-Gabor wavelet, the 
concept of geometric invariance is used and images are 
further adjusted to correct the alignments of those important 
facial features for the test and reference images. Figure 12 
compares the resultant images after normalization, where 
image set 12(a) uses conventional ASM algorithm and image 
set 12(b) incorporates the concept of geometric invariance. 
The improved feature alignment (synthesized image quality) 
of the proposed system is clearly visible in the latter image set. 
This improved accuracy is also evident in Table 2, which 
gives comparative success rates for facial feature alignments 
using both the conventional ASM algorithm and the proposed 
system. The conventional ASM algorithm shows a maximum 
feature alignment success rate of 62.8% (for eye alignment) 
and a minimum of just 2.5% (for mouth alignment), while the 
proposed system achieved 100% success rates for all cases. 
Normalization is a very important step in the age synthesis 
process, as accurate results can only be obtained when the 
important facial features of both the test and reference images 
are properly aligned.
