英文摘要 
High-efficiency multijunction or tandem 
solar cells based on group III–V 
semiconductor alloys are applied in a rapidly 
expanding range of space and terrestrial 
programs. Resistance to high-energy radiation 
damage is an essential feature of such cells as 
they power most satellites, including those 
used for communications, defense, and 
scientific research. Recently we have shown 
that the energy gap of In1-xGaxN alloys 
potentially can be continuously varied from 
0.7 to 3.4 eV, providing a full-solar-spectrum 
material system for multijunction solar cells.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Currently used multijunction solar cells 
are based on two or three junctions of 
different semiconductor materials connected 
in series.
1–3
 Efficiencies exceeding 30% have 
been achieved with Ga0.51In0.49P/GaAs/Ge 
triple junction devices.
4
 Theoretical 
considerations of the solar cell efficiency have 
shown that incorporation of a fourth junction  
 
 
made of a semiconductor with an energy gap 
of about 1 to 1.1 eV will significantly improve 
the performance of the existing multijunction 
~MJ! cells.
5,6
 One of the candidate materials 
for the fourth junction is the Ga1-yInyNxAs1-x 
alloy, which with the proper choice of the 
composition can be grown lattice matched to 
GaAs and has a bandgap in the desired energy 
range.
7,8
 There has been an intense effort 
aimed at fabricating four-junction solar cells 
by adding this material. However, so far the 
quality of these quaternary alloys is inferior to 
that of the other component materials of the 
existing MJ cells, and is detrimental to their 
overall performance.
9,10
 
Recently, the energy gap of wurtzite InN 
has been found to be about 0.7 eV.
11–13
 This 
gap is almost three times smaller than the 
previously claimed value of 2 eV.
14
 This 
discovery has extended the range of the 
energy gaps of group III-nitride alloys from 
the deep ultraviolet to the practically very 
important near infrared spectral region. It has 
been shown that the band gap of In1-xGaxN 
alloys can be varied continuously from 0.7 to 
3.4 eV.
15
 As is shown in Fig. 1, this spectral 
range provides an almost perfect fit to the 
solar spectrum, offering a unique opportunity 
to design MJ solar cells using a single ternary 
alloy system. 
Since outer space is one of the primary 
locations for applications of MJ solar cells, the 
sensitivity to high-energy particle damage is 
one of the most important characteristics of 
these materials.
16,17
 It is well-known that the 
primary cause for the degradation of solar 
cells in space are due to bombardment by 
protons and electrons in the energy range of 
electron volts to hundreds of million electron 
volts.

particle irradiation. The observed correlation 
between the energy position of EFS relative to 
the band edges and the effects of radiation on 
the material properties indicates that the 
radiation hardness of InN and InGaN alloys is 
an intrinsic property of these materials, rather 
than an extrinsic insensitivity caused by the 
high density of defects that already exist in the 
starting materials. This explanation is further 
supported by the effects of irradiation on the 
transport properties of these materials. FIG. 3

 proton irradiation. 
 
Fig. 3 
In the inset of Fig. 3, representative PL decay 
curves of In0.68Ga0.32N are shown. For 
un-irradiated samples the PL lifetime of 
Ga0.51In0.49P is 2.5 times longer the lifetime of 
In0.68Ga0.32N. However it is seen in Fig. 3 that 
the radiation damage has a dramatic effect on 
the lifetime of Ga0.51In0.49P with the lifetime 
reduced by an order of magnitude for the 
highest irradiation dose. In stark contrast, 
In0.68Ga0.32N is found to be much less 
sensitive to the radiation damage. The highest 
radiation dose reduces the PL lifetime by only 
50% to about 0.4 ns, which is more than two 
times longer than the PL lifetime of 
Ga0.51In0.49P after similar irradiation. This 
result is consistent with the PL measurements 
that show a much smaller effect of radiation 
damage on the PL intensity of In0.68Ga0.32N 
than on that of Ga0.51In0.49P. 
Prior to the irradiation, the GaAs film is 
n-type with a resistivity of 146 Vcm. After the 
irradiation with 1.123x10

 of protons, it 
becomes highly resistive with resistivity 
exceeding 10
4
 V cm. A similar increase in 
resistivity after irradiation has been reported 
for GaInP. And also observed in our GaInP 
films. On the other hand, as demonstrated in 
Fig. 4, InN shows only a small increase 
~about 15% in the free electron concentration 
and an 11% reduction in the free electron 
mobility, corresponding to a negligible change 
in resistivity from 0.0071 to 0.0069 Vcm. 
In0.68Ga0.32N shows a slight decrease in free 
electron concentration and a slight increase in 
mobility, corresponding to a decrease in 
resistivity from 0.027 to 0.019 Vcm.
