This project is a follow-up study of the 2009’s research project named “A Study for the 
Representation and Retrieval of Spatial Topology in a Case Library.” Via previous research 
results, i.e. an interactive encoding and retrieving tools of spatial topology, and encoded 
design cases information, this project will introduce more data mining algorithms into the 
case library for ranking and classifying searched results. The purpose of this project is to 
extend the knowledge representing abilities of our design case library for not only storing 
spatial topological information, but also can retrieve and classify design patterns, thereby 
assisting the user in learning the design knowledge within relevant cases. 
Concrete results of this study are as follows: 
1. Encoding spatial topology: A simple means of encoding spatial topology is 
proposed, which are more closing to an architect’s thinking in early design stages 
by the spatial associations, in order to evaluate the similarities of spatial topologies 
of house plans. 
2. Algorithm of the similarities of spatial topologies: Based on the previous encoding 
means, this study applied the cosine similarity algorithm, which is a clustering 
algorithm of similarity in data mining, to raking the similarities of house planes. 
3. Implementation of TPM: Improving the interfaces of previous STR system, TPM 
was implemented by integrated the similarity algorithm of spatial topologies to 
ranking the results of retrieved planes of house cases. 
4. Preliminary tests: Providing TPM to teachers and assistant for preliminary testing of 
spatial topology encoding and retrieval. It was found that the similarity algorithm of 
spatial topologies couldn’t revolve the differences of geometric features such as 
areas and shapes of spaces. How to integrate the geometric and topological features 
of house plans into the similarity algorithm will be the basis for the next phase of 
improvement. 
Through the implementation of TPM, the contribution of this project is to integrate the 
visual design language and graphic user interface in order to solve the problems for encoding, 
expression and acquisition of implicit “space topology” knowledge of a case library. 
Meanwhile, by providing the operating procedure of “spatial topology knowledge,” this 
project displays a different approach form the current BIM technology, and a digital tool, 
which more meets design logical thinking, and design procedures of an architect. The results 
of this project should be able to occur role model and inspire current CAAD software, which 
over-emphasis on relationships of solid geometry for the application of building construction. 
Second, for architectural design education, CAAD can no longer just a drawing, modeling 
techniques and perspective painting tools only, indeed can be used as a utility for design 
teaching, expression of design knowledge and design exploration.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Alexander proposed “a Pattern Language” for capturing perennial solutions of recurring problems within physical 
construction contexts[1]. His work inspired the idea of “design pattern” for formal documenting good practices of 
a solution to a design problem in a special expertise such as software engineering. In the field of architectural 
design, important precedents in textbooks or practices are important sources for acquiring design patterns. One 
reason for the development of an architectural design case library is the collection of the design knowledge and 
experience obtained from case studies[7]. Design patterns should be one of important knowledge within a design 
case library; however, design patterns are usually implicit and most of case libraries lack a feasible mechanism for 
automatically generalizing design patterns. 
Currently, an architectural deign case library is usually constructed by applying rational database technology, 
which requires selecting the most specific common features of a case and then converting those features into 
metadata of design information. The selected explicit features serve as the indexing mechanism and knowledge 
representation of the design cases for the library. However, this indexing mechanism using explicit features often 
overlooks the acquisition, re-indexing, and generalization of the implicit knowledge among different cases. 
This paper is a follow-up study of a previous project named “Spatial Topology Retrieval (STR).” STR established 
a visual and interactive tool for encoding and retrieving spatial topology of floor plans within a case library[9]. The 
case library is another previous project named “Open Case Study (OCS)”, which is an online house design case 
library with ontology-based authoring tools of metadata for case’s features[8]. This paper introduces clustering 
analysis algorithm to analyze and classify the pattern of spatial topology of floor plans within the case library. 
Based on the results of classifications, this paper proposes a visual interface named “Topology Pattern Mining 
(TPM)” to present and rank searching results in response to users’ queries. The purpose of TPM is to extend the 
capacity of OCS’s knowledge representation, which can not only store spatial topological information, but also 
retrieve and classify design patterns, which thereby helps designers as well as participants  to select appropriate 
cases from the library. 
2 THE APPROACH FOR MINING SPATIAL TOPOLOGY PATTERN 
The nature of architectural design is to appropriately create and arrange topological and geometric relations 
between vacant spaces and physical components of a building. Eastman proposed the building product models[3], 
which categorized a building’s information into three types – geometric, semantic, and topological information – 
and initiated  research on building information model (BIM). Presently, BIM is already applied in commercial CAAD 
tools, and is widely adopted by the AEC application field. However, most implementations of BIM are more aligned 
to document generation and final construction application [5]. Consequently, those implementations all lack the 
topological information of indoor or outdoor spaces, which is required for early architectural design and 
performance analysis. 
In the early design phase, an architect usually first considers the “topological relationship” among vacant 
spaces of a building program instead of the detailed geometric properties of physical components. For example, an 
architect may consider the adjacency among relevant rooms, the circulation formed by the connections of accesses 
and corridors among rooms, and directions of views formed by the opening, etc. From the view of case-based 
design, the topological knowledge for how to organize relevant spaces of a building project is stored in the case 
itself. However, how to index, retrieve, and represent this design knowledge still remains  a problem for the 
development of a case library. To solve this problem, a case library needs: (1) methods for encoding spatial 
topology of floor plans; (2) an algorithm for weighting the similarities of spatial topologies; (3) an algorithm for 
clustering similar spatial topologies, and; (4) a means for representing the results of classification. 
2.1 Encoding Spatial Topology 
The data model, which represents and reasons topological relationships among spatial features, is an important 
issue in geographic information sys-tem (GIS), but it is usually ignored in CAAD research. Basic topological 
relationships within GIS include adjacency, overlapping, disjointness, inclusion, etc.[11]. However, not all topologies 
are useful for architectural design; such as overlapping and inclusion. Other relations such as the accessibility, 
which is formed by accesses between interior spaces, are more important than basic topologies in GIS. 
In the previous study, STR modeled three manipulatable and two detectable spatial topologies for encoding 
spatial topology[9]. The three manipulatable spatial topologies are: (1) adjacency; (2) connection; and (3) 
combination. The two detectable spatial topologies are: (4) opening and (5) spatial orientation (Fig. 1).

3 REPRESENTATION OF SPATIAL TOPOLOGY PATTERNS 
“Design pattern” is a formal documentation of a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise. 
Therefore, “design pattern” seems to be a satisfied representation of design knowledge within a case library. 
However, scholars have pointed out that most of the early case-based systems have failed to require, re-index, and 
generalize design knowledge within the case libraries[4], and not to mention to represent design patterns of cases.  
The purpose of TPM is to extend the capacity of OCS’s knowledge representation, which can not only store 
spatial topological information, but also retrieve and classify design patterns of spatial topologies. For representing 
design patterns of spatial topologies, TPM proposes two approaches for visualizing similarities among floor plans 
of design cases and individual spaces in separate floor plans. 
3.1 Hybrid Representation of Floor Plan Patterns 
The display of a multidimensional vector representing the features of a specific data point on a two-dimensional 
screen is usually a problem encountered when trying to visualize ranking and clustering results in data-mining 
domain. However, the problem for TPM to display the ranking results of spatial topologies on a two-dimensional 
screen should be only one metric of similarity scores. 
 Therefore, TPM takes a hybrid approach which applies basic geometric features of floor plans, i.e. the differences 
of total areas of floor plans, as an other dimension of similarity. By integrating basic geometric features with 
topological similarities of separate floor plans, TPM can rank relevant floor plans for retrieved cases and display 
results of ranking on a two-dimensional screen at the same time that it avoids confusion. Figure 3 demonstrates 
the concepts of TPM’s interface for visualizing retrieved patterns. TPM arranges relevant floor plans along the y-
axis by topological similarity scores and along x-axis by differences of total areas. The distances between y-axis 
among cases are based on the reciprocals of similarity scores. The distances between x-axis among cases are based 
the different percentages of total areas. Therefore, if the retrieved case is C6 of the demonstrations in Figure 2, 
then all six cases may be displayed in TPM in the manner shown in Figure 5.

3.2 Partial Representation of Spatial Topology Patterns in a Floor Plan 
The similarity scores of spatial topologies in TPM are measured by all topologies in floor plans of all cases. 
Therefore, the similarity scores of two floor plans cannot be easily ranked according to partial similarities or 
differences between those plans. However, since the metric of every type of spatial topology is cumulated within 
the system, the ranking of topological weighting among different types of spaces can effectively reduce 
permutations of different types of spaces. Therefore, it is possible to implement an interface for the partial 
representation of spatial topologies and for retrieving relevant floor plans according to the ranking of topological 
weighting among different types of spaces.

proposals usually died in the process, with nothing left behind [6]. A tool like TRM, which can reveal past design 
patterns, should prove to be very helpful for architects and their clients in selecting appropriate proposals and 
avoiding tedious and inefficient communications. However, as mentioned above, the design situations and 
semantic explanations are still the keys for successful representations of design knowledge in the patterns. Further 
investigation is necessary for improving TRM to assist in communications between architects and their clients. 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
Alexander proposed the idea of “pattern language” for describing and organizing good design practices of building 
design, and inspired the concept of “design pattern” for many complex engineering tasks such as software 
engineering. Therefore, for representing design solutions and its problem, a case library can also be an 
architectural design pattern library. However, due to the lack of generalizing means for design patterns, the only 
representation of design pattern in most case libraries is the case itself. As a result, no case library can provide a 
mechanism for acquiring, then retrieving design patterns. 
TPM demonstrates a data-mining approach for detecting the topological features of floor plans, which 
automatically derives the patterns of spatial topologies. By applying data-mining algorithms to weight similarity 
among floor plans of cases, TPM can cluster similar floor plans in order to reveal their patterns of spatial 
topologies. TPM implements a visual retrieval interface for displaying relevant floor plans of cases based on 
topological similarity scores and basic geometric features. By applying the searching and mapping functions of 
database technology, TPM can map the partial topological layout as a query for retrieving similar floor plans from 
the library. 
However, the data-mining approach is a method that requires a large quantity of calculations. When a new 
permutation of spatial topologies appears, it requires time to re-measure and regenerate similarity scores among 
all cases. Therefore, an efficient implementation for weighting and clustering complex building types is a challenge 
for this approach. Finally, further investigation needs to be conducted on how to integrate more topological 
features, such as separating, opening and orientation, and geometric features, such as shape, dimensions and area 
of individual spaces in the floor plans, into the weighting and clustering algorithm.
