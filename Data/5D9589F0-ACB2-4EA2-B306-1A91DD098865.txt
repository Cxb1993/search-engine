二、緒論 
Ge(Se,S)2 series crystals are direct semiconductors that cover an energy range from green to blue 
visible portion. There are three crystallographic modifications appeared in germanium 
dichalcogenides depending on growth temperature. They are low-temperature (LT)-GeX2 (X=S, 
Se) with a complex three-dimensional crystal structure, high-temperature (HT)-GeX2 with a layer 
structure, and γ-GeX2 with hexagonal SnSe2 structure of CdI2 type. The basic building blocks for 
the GeX2 structure are the Ge(X1/2)4 tetrahedra. The tetrahedra in the LT phase are mutually 
connected via only sharing corners (SC). The tetrahedra in the HT modification are connected both 
via SC and via sharing edges (SE). The unit cells of HT- and LT-GeX2 are both monoclinic. The 
crystalline phase in the ternary Ge(Se1-xSx)2 (0<x<1) should be similar to that of HT- or LT-GeX2 
(X=Se, S). The band-edge characteristic for the HT- or LT- GeX2 is maybe different, however no 
optical evidence has been explored. 
In this report the optical properties of GeSe2, GeS2, and the mixed compounds of Ge(Se1-xSx)2 
(0<x<1) have been characterized using TR experiments in the energy range of 2-3.8 eV. Two 
excitonic features of EA and EB are observed in the band edge of all Ge(Se1-xSx)2 (0≤x≤1) samples. 
Composition-dependent TR spectra of Ge(Se1-xSx)2 showed that the transition energies of EB(n=1) 
are nearly invariant to a value of 3.244±0.008 eV with increasing the S composition from x=0 to 
x=1. This observation indicates the EB transition is originated from the larger Ge-Ge bonds in the 
germanium dichalcogenides. Resistivity measurements of Ge(Se1-xSx)2 show the higher in-plane 
resistivity of the higher S-incorporated germanium dichalcogenide due to the higher purity and 
larger band gap. 
 
三、實驗 
 
The chalcogenides crystals of Ge(Se1-xSx)2 with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 were grown 
by vertical Bridgman (VB) method. The detailed procedure for the VB growth were reported 
elsewhere. The as-grown Ge(Se, S)2 crystals were essentially layer type. X-ray diffraction 
measurements confirmed the high-temperature (HT) phase of the Ge(Se1-xSx)2 with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 
0.6, and 0.8. For GeS2, both of the diffraction peaks of HT- and LT- phases are simultaneously 
detected in the X-ray diffraction pattern. GeS2 is crystallized in the HT and LT mixed phases. The 
TR measurements were done with the layered samples put in air and operated at room 
temperature. The experimental details of TR were described elsewhere. For 
polarization-dependent measurements, a pair of Glan-Taylor-prism polarizers is utilized. The 
measurements were done with different angles of linearly polarized lights impinge on as-grown 
 6
a-axis and the other edge-shared tetrhedra linked in between the chains. From the optical 
anisotropy of the EB transition present in Fig. 1, it is inferred that the origins of EA and EB are 
different. EA is closely related to the transition of Se p lone-pair electrons to Ge-Se s* antibonding 
states. EB is the direct transition from undercoordinated Ge 4p bonding state to Ge 4s* 
antibonding state inside the SC or SE units. 
Fig. 1. Angular-dependent TR spectra of GeSe2 with the incident angles varied 
from θi=20° to θi=55°. The inset shows the experimental data of absorption 
coefficient for determining the optical gap of GeSe2. 
 
To determine the EB is dominant by SC or SE units, polarization-dependent TR measurements 
of θi=20° are carried out to verify. The experiments were done with the polarized angles of the 
linearly polarized lights set at 0° (E || b-axis), 45°, 90° (E || a-axis), and 135°, respectively. Fig. 2 
shows the polarized-TR spectra of the EA and EB features of GeSe2. The polarization dependence 
of transition amplitudes of EB shows the highest intensity is present in the 90° (E || a-axis) 
spectrum while the amplitude of the 0° (E || b-axis) spectrum is the lowest. The intensities of the 
spectra of 45° and 135° are nearly comparable and they are lying in between the values for 0° and 
90°. The largest intensity of EB feature in the spectrum of 90° indicates the EB transition is largely

MoSe2 and WSe2. From the angular-dependent and polarization-dependent TR experiments of 
GeSe2, the EB can be temporarily assigned as the excitonic transition from the Ge 4p 
spin-split-off valence band to the Ge 4s* antibonding conduction band at a lower symmetric point 
other than Γ (e.g. T point in the β-GaSe) in the band structure of GeSe2. However, a more 
detailed band-structure calculation should be carried out to verify this assignment.

Displayed in Fig. 3 are the unpolarized TR spectra of Ge(Se1-xSx)2 with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 
and 1. The energy value of EA demonstrates an energy blue-shift behavior with respect to the 
increase of sulfur composition from x=0 to x=1 while the EB feature reveals an energy invariant 
character in the substitution of S and Se. The energy invariant character verifies that the EB is 
originated from the Ge-Ge bond. The energy value of EA(n=1) for GeSe2, Ge(Se0.8S0.2)2, 
Ge(Se0.6S0.4)2, Ge(Se0.4S0.6)2, and Ge(Se0.2S0.8)2 is lower than that of EB in Fig. 3. This result 
indicates that the Ge(Se1-xSx)2 crystals with 0≤x≤0.8 are crystallized in the same crystal phase, i.e.

In summary, we have characterized the band-edge property of layered Ge(Se1-xSx)2 (0≤x≤1) 
using angular-dependent and polarization-dependent TR measurements at 300 K. Two Rydberg 
series of EA and EB are observed in the TR spectrum of GeSe2. The transition origins of EA and 
EB are evaluated. The TR experiments also verify that Ge(Se1-xSx)2 with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 
0.8 are crystallized in the HT-GeX2 (X=Se, S) phase while the GeS2 belongs to the mixed phases 
of HT- and LT-GeX2. For HT-GeS2, the transition energy is of EA < EB while the value is of EA > 
EB when the chalcogenide is crystallized in the major phase of LT-GeS2. High in-plane resistivity 
of the layers indicates the high purity of the germanium dichalcogenides.
