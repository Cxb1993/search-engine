the bimaterials presents a formidable challenge for analytical solutions for
problems with practical applications. Therefore, it is very important to develop
accurate and efficient techniques to study interface cracks.
The elasticity solutions of interface crack problems had been worked out by
variety researcher. Erdogan [1], England [2], Rice & Sih [3] obtained the the-
oretical solutions of the stress and displacement fields at the interface crack.
The solutions of the problems were based on the assumption that the crack
faces were traction free and the stresses possessed an oscillatory character of
the type r−1/2 sin (or cos), where r is the radial distance from the crack tip.
Following this open solution, Clech et al. [4] developed a finite element tech-
nique to determine stress intensity factors of no-slip bimaterial cracks. Lee &
Choi [5] determined the stress intensity factors for bimaterial interface cracks
using the subregion boundary element method. Tan & Gao [6] also utilised
the boundary element technique to analyse interface cracks under the open
solution. This assumption pointed out that the crack opening displacement
u+y − u−y also oscillates as r → 0, however, implying that the the crack open-
ing displacement is negative. This solution is contradictory because the gap
between the crack faces is negative on parts of the crack.
This paradox was resolved by Comninou [7], who presented a new theory of
elasticity in problems involving interface cracks. Comninou replaced the trac-
tion free boundary condition at the crack faces by the boundary conditions
for frictionless contact at the crack tips. This theory stated that contact trac-
tions can only be compressive and crack opening displacements can only be
positive. Comninou solution showed that there is a single contact zone at each
crack tip. Gautesen & Dundurs [8] developed exact solutions of the Comninou
integral equations. If a plane interface crack is loaded in tension, the contact
zones are very smaller than the crack length and will be smaller than the nu-
merical mesh size surrounding the crack tip, which numerical difficulties were
encountered because of the extremely small size of contact zones. However, if
the open solution and the contact solution differ significantly only within the
small mesh size, the difference is of little practical importance and the two
solutions might be regarded as interchangeable [9].
We have mentioned that there exists two models for interface crack problems,
namely, the open solution and the close solution. Following the above feature,
the present paper provides the stress intensity factors of the bimaterial in-
terface cracks using the mixed mode definition [10,11]. The open solution is
utilised only for extremely small crack tip contact zones, so that numerical
difficulties may be avoided. The close solution is adopted whenever the size of
crack tip contact zone may be large enough to be detected by the numerical
technique. The special subregion boundary element method [12,13] is used to
obtain the stress and displacement distributions on the bimaterial boundaries.
Furthermore, the discontinuous quarter point element [14,15] is employed to

respectively. Instead of using the boundary element system directly, the left

is given as [17]
K∗ = σ∞yy(1 + 2iε)

K∗ = (σyy + σxy)θ=0

and a is the the open part of the crack. As the contact zones are extreme
small in comparison to the length of the crack, Equation (12) will be equal to
the absolute value of Equation (13). Therefore, either the open or the contact
solutions would give the same value of the stress intensity factor. The present
numerical method gives sufficiently accurate results over the whole physical
range of 0 ≤ β ≤ 0.4, where β is defined as
β =
µ2(κ1 − 1)− µ1(κ2 − 1)
µ2(κ1 + 1) + µ1(κ2 + 1)
(15)
The result, using the normalising stress intensity factor |K∗|/T√piL , is plotted
in Figure 3. For comparison with the exact solution using the contact solution
[8], current numerical and Reference [8] results also are listed in Table 1, which
agree well within 0.8%.

Whereas, the size of a crack tip contact zone may also be large enough to be
detected by the numerical technique, then the close solution will be used. The
stress intensity factor is

The bimaterial properties keep the same as that employed in the previous
analysis. The interface traction matrix system (7) has to be rearranged while
the contact zones change the crack boundary condition. The feature on the
present numerical method is that only new rows and new columns need to be
added on the interface matrix system. The results are given for the five ratios
T/S = 0.4, 0.2, 0, −0.2 and −0.4. The variation of b/L, which determines the
extension of the large contact zone, is shown in Table 2. The variation with
β of the normalised stress intensity factor KII/(T
2 + S2)−1/2
√
piL at the tip
with large contact zone is shown in Figure 5. Comparison with the previusly
reported results by Gautesen & Dundures [20], the results for various loading
ratios T/S are listed in Table 3, which agree well within 1.2%. It is interesting
to note that, choosing the large contact zone roughly, the results of stress
intensity factor are still in good agreement with the exact solutions.
