一、計畫緣由與目的 
企業可利用競爭者技術佈局、產
業技術缺口或技術發展趨勢等相關情
報有效預測未來具研發價值的技術領
域，提早擬訂研發方向與策略，將有
機會比競爭者更早佈局新技術而獲取
商機與市場。有效地搶先佈局新技術
已成為提升企業競爭力的關鍵要素，
因此發展一套分析方法作為企業技術
佈局與創新研發的參考依據已成為當
務之急。新技術的創造者常運用專利
保護他們的智慧資產，藉以抵擋侵權
或實施商業攻擊 (Watanabe, Tsuji, & 
Griffy-Brown, 2001)。 
專利文件富含創新的技術資訊，
能及時辨別與確認技術的變化，若善
加分析專利資訊將有助於企業獲得價
值(Hall, Griliches, & Hausman, 1986; 
Mogee, 1991; Berkowitz, 1993)。透過專
利分析的成果，可以預測技術發展、
規劃研發方向、避免誤觸專利權而浪
費研發資源，並有效掌握企業發展動
向與市場需求(Campbell, 1983; 賴奎
魁、鄭伶如、張智翔，2002)。研發管
理者可依據使用之目的，選擇適當的
專利分析方式，透過分析結果擬訂策
略，協助企業獲取利益(王明妤、許旭
昇，2005)。 
專利資訊若以視覺化的方式呈
現，其優點是以最少的文字說明技術
情境，以及短時間內簡化與表達隱藏
的珍貴資訊(Yoon, Yoon, & Park, 2002; 
Yoon & Park, 2004)。專利資訊視覺化
的分析方法多數統稱為專利地圖，專
利地圖能容易地且有效地揭露專利分
析後的技術資訊(Kim, Suh, & Park, 
2008)。目前多數的專利地圖是依個別
變數(發明人、國家別、權利人等)呈現
敘述統計分析的結果，但無法同時呈
現多變數間的多重對應關係與揭露隱
藏的技術情報。 
統計方法中對應分析可將複雜的
資料以簡單且有效保存原有訊息的方
式轉換成視覺化的地圖，同時呈現變
數與類別資料的相對位置，並有效地
挖掘與分析多變數間的對應關係與隱
藏訊息(Dore, Ojasoo, Okubo, Durand, 
Dudognon, & Miquel, 1996; Dore, 
Dutheuil, & Miquel, 2000)。但多變數與
類別對應的二維平面圖易造成多點間
距離遠近或多點重疊的視覺錯覺，若
利用集群分析可釐清與改善此缺失
(Lebart, 1994)。因此，本計畫整合對應
分析與集群分析的視覺化效果呈現出
專利變數間相對應的複雜關聯性，並
藉由變數間對應的關聯性挖掘出隱藏
的珍貴訊息。 
    專利地圖的表達類型眾多，可依
照不同的使用目的選取專利說明書內
不同的變數資訊而呈現，若依據應用
類型可分為技術專利地圖、管理專利
地圖，以及權利範圍專利地圖(Korea 
National Statistical Office, 1999)。本計
畫依據使用目的選取技術專利地圖的
主要變數如權利人、分類號與申請日
期，形成「多重對應關係之技術專利
地圖」。多重對應關係之技術專利地圖
可依據不同的變數組合揭露出不同的
技術情報，權利人與分類號的變數組
合能協助研發人員掌握企業與其競爭
對手的技術佈局情勢與當前產業的技
術缺口，權利人、分類號與申請日期
的組合能察覺企業的技術動向與預測
技術的發展趨勢。因此本計畫將形成
兩種不同使用目的之技術專利地圖進

並於此發現專利文件於 1994 年的
累計數量之比率為 50%，因此分成
前、後二期各別是 1962~1994 年與
1995~2005 年。此時若有權利人的
專利分佈橫跨前、後二期，則在計

企業專利佈局的動向或技術發展趨

b. 專利變數分群：經由上一個步驟
後，各變數皆會形成(Dimension 1, 
Dimension 2)的座標資料型態。此步
驟是投入座標資料進行運算，運算
的過程可細分為二，首先是將座標
資料以華德法繪製成樹狀圖，用來
決定分群的數目，其次是使用 K 組
平均法將座標位置接近(或關聯性
較高)的變數歸為一群。 
c. 形成專利地圖：本計畫將繪製出二
種類型的多變數對應技術專利地

企業目前技術佈局的情況，以及探討
技術發展的缺口與趨勢，透過這些專
利情報進行研發策略的擬定。本計畫
分析結果期待作為提供企業經營者或

熟與受到重視，即可稱 H01L 為薄膜太
陽能電池技術發展的熱門領域。反觀
C22B、B05D、B32B、C03C 等僅出現
在群 II 之特定群組，可表示目前極少
廠商重視研發這些類型的技術，或技
術尚未普及，也就是說明了單晶、多

較具特殊、非主流的特性，或被忽視

僅有少數廠商掌握技術與研發，可視
為當前產業的技術缺口，值得廠商注
意在未來是否可能成為關鍵技術而使

    以群內比對發現群 III 的技術類型
最為多元，包括 C22B、B05D、B32B、
C03C、C23C、C25D、C30B、F24J 與
H01L，其完整的分類號更是多達 53
類，且權利人數為 68 個，包括廠商、
個人或研究單位，為專利密集的一級
戰區，即表示群 III 為最多廠商投入研

熱門技術區，包括鐘淵化學工業、富
士電機、大西洋富田、夏普、三菱、
英國石油等國際大廠皆座落於座標

    綜合上述群間與群內的交叉比
對，由群 I、II 與 IV 的技術情境得知
H01L 與 C23C 相對於其它技術領域的
發展較為成熟，但仍有可投入研發或
進行專利佈局之處，如 C23C14/22 僅

C25D、C30B、C22B 與 F24J 僅有少數

風險性之後，可以優先考慮研發這些
技術類型，將有機會比競爭者更早佈

have been developed to enhance the capability of benchmark
selection of traditional DEA. In terms of quality and operating
outputs, Sherman and Zhu [7] developed a Quality-Adjusted
DEA (Q-DEA) for selecting high-operating and high-quality
benchmark DMUs. However, the Q-DEA is limited to a single
output measure of quality objective. In particular, the Q-DEA
only provides appropriate benchmark DMUs for inefficient
DMUs in terms of the operating objective. Shimshak and
Lenard [2] then proposed a Two-Model DEA (TM-DEA), which
enhanced Q-DEA by considering the ability to cope with not
only multiple operating outputs, but also multiple quality
outputs. Importantly, TM-DEA provides inefficient DMUs with
appropriate benchmark DMUs on the operating and quality
objectives. Although recognized as an “advanced Q-DEA”, 
TM-DEA still has some potential limitations. For instance,
TM-DEA must establish minimally acceptable levels of
operating efficiency and quality efficiency to exclude
inappropriate benchmark DMUs from analysis. Additionally,
after removing inappropriate benchmark DMUs, the adjusted
DMUs in the final evaluation may retain some of the original
ones. Moreover, a situation in which the minimal acceptable
level is not adequately high, i.e., close to 100%, may pose that
the performance of some selected operating (or quality)
benchmark DMUs is dominated by that of the corresponding
inefficient DMUs under the quality (or operating) objective.
Thus, the purpose of this study is to overcome the above
potential limitations to seek appropriate benchmark DMUs in
the presence of two-objective outputs (or inputs).
2. LITERATURE REVIE
DEA with two-objective outputs might begin to receive
considerable attention around the 1990s. While considering an
early DEA study involving banking, Camanho and Dyson [5]
indicated that “profitability was not directly included in the 
DEA model as the output because it should be seen as a
diferent dimension from the operating eficiency”. Profitability
outputs are converted into a comprehensive profit index by
adopting the earning analysis system [5]. Operating outputs and
multiple inputs are converted into the operating efficiency by
using DEA [5]. Lastly, Camanho and Dyson [5] employed
“eficiency-profitability matrix” to present the bank branches’ 
performance profile.
Fig. 1. Efficiency-profitability matrix.
Figure 1 shows the efficiency-profitability matrix that was
originally proposed by Boussofiane, et al. [10]. Basically
efficiency-profitability matrix was the integration of the DEA
methodology and the BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix
[11]. The efficiency-profitability matrix is plotted as follows: (a)
the efficiency score of DMUs is measured by using DEA; (b)
DMUs are graphed on a two-dimensional space, where
efficiency score and profit index are placed on the horizontal
and the vertical axis, respectively; (c) the graph is subjectively
divided into four quadrants, i.e. starts, sleepers, cows, and dogs,
for representing high and low efficiency/profit; (d) DMUs are
assigned directions for improving their performance. For
instance, DMUs should increase their efficiency and maintain
their profitability if they are located on the second quadrant, i.e.
sleepers.
Soteriou and Stavrinides [4] and Soteriou and Zenios [6]
further considered that the outputs were derived from the quality
and operating objectives. In addition to measuring the quality
efficiency by using quality outputs, that study also evaluated the
operating efficiency by using operating outputs. All DMUs were
then graphed two dimensionally where operating efficiency and
quality efficiency were placed on the horizontal and the vertical
axis, respectively. Next, the graph was subjectively divided into
four quadrants for representing high and low operating
efficiency/quality efficiency; the directions of performance
improvement for DMUs were proposed as well. However, both
the efficiency-profitability matrix and efficiency-quality matrix
could not provide the appropriate benchmark DMUs because
DMUs with low profits or low quality efficiency may be
operating benchmark DMUs (100% operating efficiency). The
inefficient DMUs may emulate low-profit or low-quality
benchmark DMUs for improving their operating efficiency.
Two recently proposed benchmarking methods that attempt
to filter out inappropriate benchmark DMUs are introduced as
follows. One is the Q-DEA proposed by Sherman and Zhu [7],
and the other is the TM-DEA developed by Shimshak and
Lenard [2]. To avoid an automatic tradeoff between quality
outputs and operating outputs when executing the Q-DEA and
TM-DEA, quality and operating objectives are considered
independent dimensions.
The Q-DEA first evaluates operating efficiency without
including the single quality output measure (i.e. quality rating).
Decision makers then require subjectively selecting the minimal
acceptable level of the quality rating. Finally, if any DMU has
100% operating efficiency but gets the quality rating below the
minimal acceptable level, it will be removed from the analysis.
The DEA model is rerun to evaluate the operating efficiency for
the adjusted DMUs until no DMU has 100% operating
efficiency but low quality rating. The selected benchmark
DMUs must have 100% operating efficiency and a sufficiently
high quality rating.
The TM-DEA first separately evaluates operating
efficiency and quality efficiency. (The operational outputs are
adopted in evaluating operating efficiency; the quality outputs
are used in evaluating quality efficiency; evaluating the
operating and quality efficiency use the common inputs.)
Decision makers then require subjectively establishing the
minimal acceptable levels of operating efficiency and quality
efficiency. Lastly, the TM-DEA filters out the inappropriate
benchmark DMUs for the operating objective and quality
objective, respectively. In terms of the operating objective, any
DMU that has 100% operating efficiency but quality efficiency
below the minimal acceptable level is excluded from analysis.
The DEA model is rerun to evaluate operating efficiency and
quality efficiency separately with the adjusted DMUs until no
operating benchmark DMU exhibits low quality efficiency. In
terms of the quality objective, any DMU that has 100% quality
efficiency but operating efficiency below the minimal
acceptable level is excluded from analysis. The DEA model is
also rerun to evaluate operating efficiency and quality efficiency
separately with the adjusted DMUs until no quality benchmark
has low operating efficiency. The selected benchmark DMUs
must have 100% operating efficiency and a sufficiently high
quality efficiency (or 100% quality efficiency and a sufficiently
high operating efficiency).

the performance of DMU E is dominated by that of DMUs B
and C in terms of objective P. However, when using the
TM-DEA for benchmark selection for objective Q, DMU E is
selected as a benchmark for DMUs B and C; this is the
occurrence of the potential limitation (3).)

bDMUs achieving Q efficiency of 1 but P efficiency below 0.7
are removed from analysis.

various efficiency levels for objective Q and P, respectively.
4. TWO-OBJECTIVE DEA (TODEA)
To avoid involving value judgments in solution procedures
and excluding DMUs from analysis, the Two-Objective DEA
(TODEA) is proposed to identify the appropriate benchmark
DMUs whose performance is not dominated by the
corresponding inefficient DMUs under either a P or Q objective
when the outputs are derived from these two objectives. The
TODEA is executed on a two-stage solution process.
Stage 1 uses the stratification DEA model [14,15] to
partition all DMUs into various subgroups of efficiency levels
characterized by EP,g and EQ,h for objectives P and Q, where g =
1, …, G (level 1 to level G), h = 1, …, H (level 1 to level H).
Following Sherman and Zhu [7], Shimshak and Lenard [2], and
Shimshak et al. [3], an automatic tradeoff between objectives P
and Q can be avoided by analyzing the efficiency of these two
objectives as independent dimensions. The outputs included in
objective P are adopted to stratify the DMUs for objective P;
the outputs included in objective Q are adopted to stratify the
DMUs for objective Q; the common inputs are used to stratify
the DMUs for objectives P and Q. Let ΩP,g represent the DMUs
located on EP,g, and let ΩQ,h represent the DMUs located on EQ,h.
After executing the stratification DEA model, two significant
results are obtained [14,15].
(1) DMUs in a specific efficiency level can be viewed as
having equal performance.
(2) ΩP,g (or ΩQ,h) are dominated by ΩP,g’ (or ΩQ,h’) if g > g’ (or
h > h’).
Hence, the stratification results can be treated as a
hierarchical category of all DMUs for representing high and low
efficiency levels.
Stage 2 performs hierarchical comparisons between the
different categories of the categorical DMUs, i.e. DEA with
categorical DMUs [16]. The DMUs in the first efficiency level
are only compared with those in the first efficiency level; DMUs
in the second efficiency level are compared with those in the
first and second efficiency levels; DMUs in the third efficiency
level are compared with those in the first, second, and third
efficiency levels, etc. Thus, DMUs in the lower efficiency levels
are not selected as the benchmarks for DMUs in upper
eficiency levels. Note that ΩP,g (or ΩQ,h) are evaluated using Q
(or P) outputs and the common inputs. The DMUs included in
ΩP,1 (or ΩQ,1) are only compared with those included in ΩP,1 (or
ΩQ,1) for objective Q (or P). The ineficient DMUs among ΩP,1
(or ΩQ,1) for objective Q (or P) are assigned appropriate
benchmarks because the efficient frontier is constructed by the
DMUs among ΩP,1 (or ΩQ,1) that have equal performance with
the inefficient DMUs in terms of objective P (or Q) but
dominate the inefficient DMUs under objective Q (or P). The
DMUs included in ΩP,u (or ΩQ,v) where u = 2, …, G (or v =
2, …, H) are compared with the DMUs included in ΩP,m(or ΩQ,n)
where m = 1, …, u (or n = 1, …, v) for objective Q (or P). The
ineficient DMUs among ΩP,u(or ΩQ,v) are assigned appropriate
benchmarks because the efficient frontier is constructed by the
DMUs among ΩP,m (or ΩQ,n) that (a) dominate the inefficient
DMUs under both P and Q objectives or (b) have equal
performance with the inefficient DMUs in terms of objective P
(or Q) but dominate the inefficient DMUs under objective Q (or
P).
Let φdenote the whole set of the evaluated DMUs, e.g., φ
= {Ωc,k | k = 1, 2} = {Ωc,1 ∪ Ωc,2},φ = {Ωc,k | k = 1, 2, 3} = {Ωc,1
∪ Ωc,2∪ Ωc,3}, and c = P or Q. The TODEA can be
systematicaly formulated as an algorithm. When “outputs” are 
derived from objectives P and Q, the TODEA algorithm is as
follows:
Step 1: Run the stratification DEA model to obtain ΩP,g (g =
1, …, G) using the outputs included in objective P and
the common inputs and to attain ΩQ,h (h = 1, …, H)
using the outputs included in objective Q and the
common inputs.
Step 2: Select c = P or Q. If c = P (or Q), w = H (or G). Set j =
0.
Step 3: Let j = j + 1. If j > w, the algorithm stops. Otherwise, go
to Step 4.
Step 4:φ = {Ωc,k | k = 1, …, j}. As c = P (or Q), evaluateφusing
the outputs included in objective Q (or P) and the
common inputs for seeking the benchmark DMUs for
ΩP (or Q),j. Go to Step 3.
One should note that the proposed TODEA can also be
applied to cope with two-objective inputs when the above Step 1
and Step 4 are modified as follows:

2.2 Correspondence analysis
The process of correspondence analysis can be
explained easily with three stages, including step (1)
calculating the categorical profiles (the relative
frequencies), step (2) computing the distances between
the points (variables), step (3) finding the n-dimensional
space that best fits the points [6]. Figure 1 describes three
steps of Clausen’s concept, and completely imitates the
assignee and International Patent Classification (IPC),
explain as follows.
Fig. 1. Three stages of correspondence analysis
Step (1) Profiles and Masses: This step transforms the
frequencies in a cross classification into proportions,
which gives two sets called “row profiles”and “column
profiles.” Each row (and column) profile may be
represented as points on the map. The average row profile
is the total of the different columns divided by the total
sum, and represents the weighted average of the row
profiles. This point is called the centroid, and is placed at
the origin of the principal axes.
Step (2) Chi-Square distance: In this study, this distance
is called the “Euclidean distance.”The distances between
points in space can be calculated using the “Pythagorean 
formula.”Refer to Eq. (1).

'( , ') ( )ij i j

s i i a a  (1)
The Chi-Square distance is a weighted Euclidean distance,
where the weight is the inverse of the respective average
profile element. Refer to Eq. (2).

'( )( , ') i j i j

  (2)
Step (3) Geometric representation: As measure of
closeness was use the weighted sum of the squared
distances (z2) from the points to the axis, where the
weights are the row masses (r). Thus, the intention is to
minimize Σ(rz2). This is the same as maximizing the
weighted sum of the squared coordinates (Σrf2). The
geometric space is presented by the above-mentioned
calculation (see Fig. 2).
Fig. 2. Correspondent position of points [6]
Researchers have successfully applied
correspondence analysis in various scientific areas, such
as exploring the correspondence relations between total
quality management and learning organization [5],
exploring relationships between the Amino acid
composition of genomes, organism lifestyles, and
evolutionary trends [26], geochemistry applications [27],
market analysis [12], and cultural information and search
behavior [10]. Correspondence analysis maps cannot
always completely explain relationships between
variables and categories, and too many variables and
categories presented simultaneously on the map may
result in visual illusions of overlap or distance.
2.3 Cluster analysis for correspondence analysis
Integrating correspondence analysis and cluster
analysis produces a single correspondence cluster
dendrogram that clearly describes relationships of
multi-variables and categories. Correspondence-cluster
analysis also differentiates between multi-variable and
multi-category relationships [13]. This two-stage analysis
method can clarify multiple data characteristics by first
quantifying multiple data characteristics with multiple
correspondence analysis, and then analyzing them with
cluster analysis [1]. This two-stage analysis was
successfully applied to explore scientific development
between countries [8].
This study uses two-tier cluster analysis, which
enables mathematical calculation in two phases: first,

Fig. 4. Tree diagram for cluster of patent variables
In Fig. 5, comparing scenario between four clusters
shows that H01L is distributed over each cluster, and
C23C is distributed over two clusters, such as cluster II
and III. Other IPC fields only focus on one cluster. For
example, B32B only appears in cluster II (see TABLE III).
These findings show that H01L and C23C are valued by
R&D by corporations, and indicate that H01L and C23C
are popular fields in the thin film photovoltaic industry.
Other IPC fields were non-mainstream, ignored, or initial
technology.
In Fig. 5, comparing scenarios within each cluster
shows that the IPC variables of cluster II and III were
diverse, and show that Canon has multi-field IPCs and its
patent portfolio has the characteristic of being both
particular and non-mainstream, such as B05D, C23C,
C25D and C30B. So, Canon can be called the leader of
non-mainstream technology fields, such as the technology
of metal surface treating, coating, electroforming, etc.
Figure 5 also reveals the R&D directions of corporations
or technology trends, showing that BP solarex, Fuji
Electric, Sanyo, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Delaware
university have capabilities in continuing innovation (see
TABLE IV). BP solarex and Fuji Electric were across the
different technology fields, such as Fuji Electric from
H01L to H01L and C23C. Other corporations focus on the
single similar field. In 1995~2005 years, corporations still
valued fields related to H01L and C23C (see TABLE IV).

The above-mentioned analysis results show that
R&D directions of the present industry still value H01L
and C23C, and few corporations surmount from H01L
and C23C into other fields. Technology gaps of the
present industry are distributed into Canon and other
corporations. Canon had R&D related to B05D, C25D,
C30B, while others had B32B, C03C, C22B, F24J fields.
For filing dates in 1995~2005, technological fields never
appeared related to F24J, which indicates that this has
less R&D potential or is an outmoded field. Therefore,
short-term technology trends still hold related to H01L
and C23C as mainstream fields, but long-term technology
trends may change from H01L and C23C to B05D, C25D,
C30B, B32B, C03C and C22B fields. Therefore, B05D,
C25D, C30B, B32B, C03C and C22B fields may become
key technological types to allow the rapid advancement
of market or technology development in the thin film
photovoltaic industry.
V. CONCLUSION
This study integrates assignee, IPC, and filing date
variables on a technical patent map using correspondence
analysis and cluster analysis. This approach visualizes the
thin film photovoltaic information of an enterprise’s
patent composition, and mainstream industrial technology
gaps or trends. Patent analysis results can be separated
into two parts as follows:
I. Enterprise situation: The technology R&D directions of
thin film photovoltaic of Sanyo, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and
the University of Delaware placed important on single
technological field and continuing innovation; BP solarex
and Fuji Electric placed important across technical field
and continuing innovation. BP solarex valued R&D for
