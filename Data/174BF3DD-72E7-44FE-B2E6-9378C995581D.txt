using HTM and proposed an NC machine online compensation method [5]. The volume error for machine 
tool work space is the function of all error terms. To ensure the geometric accuracy of five-axis machine 
tools, machine assembly must go through a substantial, time-consuming calibration process.  
Currently, certain types of measurement devices are able to measure geometric errors in machine 
tools; the most common and most efficient of which is the API 6D laser interferometer [6]. This 
measurement device can simultaneously measure six degrees of freedom on a linear motion axis. The 
DBB, another common measurement device, is used to examine dynamic errors in linear motion axes [7]. 
Lei et al. (2007) applied the DBB to test for errors in the rotary axis of five-axis machine tools [8]. Lei 
and Hsu (2002) developed a probe-ball measuring device that could directly measure the overall errors of 
a five-axis machine tool and, thus, evaluate its accuracy [9]. Weikert (2004) showed that the R-test, which 
can measure static and dynamic errors in five-axis simultaneous machines, still had limited applications 
in analyzing five-axis geometric and dynamic errors [10]. The LaserTRACER offers an efficient, 
high-precision measurement system for volumetric calibration, but this measurement system is very 
expensive [11]. 
Although the theoretical error model of five-axis machine tool is known, it is still impossible to 
improve the accuracy of five-axis machine tool with the error compensation technique based on it. The 
reason is there are some not directly measurable location and component errors in the error model, such 
as the inaccurate location and component errors of rotary axes block. These errors are exist as deviations 
between coordinate systems and are difficult to access after the mounting process. It is clear that the key 
step toward effective accuracy enhancement of five-axis machine tools is the identification of these 
unknown location and component errors of rotary axes. 
The least square estimation (LSE) methods provide with mathematical procedures by which a linear 
model can achieve a best fit to experimental data in the sense of least-squared error. The methods are 
powerful and well-developed mathematical tools that have been proposed and used in a variety of areas 
for decades, including adaptive control, signal processing, and statistics[12]. In the field of errors 
estimation of five-axis machine tools, Lei and Hsu (2002) showed the probe-ball error model was 
constructed and based on the data accumulated by a probe-ball. For errors which the least square 
estimation method can be used to gain a precise estimate[13]. some other researches also used this 
method to estimate error components [14-16]. 
In this paper, the error model of the R-test measurement in five-axis machine tools be derived. the 
estimation of the unknown and not directly measurable location errors and ball position errors in the error 
model is addressed. Based on this relationship and the measured overall position errors with measuring 
path K4, the location errors of rotary axes and ball position errors can be estimated very accurately with 
the least square estimation methods. 
 
2. Error model of R-test measurement 
2.1 Geometric error definition of linear and rotary axes 
Definitions in IS0230 related to error test standards for CNC machine tools include the definition of 
geometric errors and the testing method. A linear motion axis is defined as possessing six component 
errors (three translational and three rotational errors), and a location (perpendicularity) error exists

Where ccc ZYX ,, are either the constant offset of the c home position with respect to the reference 
coordinate system in the x,y,z direction, respectively, or the kinematic parameter for the C-axis rotary 
turntable. XOC and YOC are the C-axis installation center and the ideal center, respectively, in the X, Y 
directional translational offset. AOC and BOC are, respectively, the location errors for the C-axis 
installation axis line and ideal coordinate system axis direction (in this example, the Y- and X-axis of the 
reference coordinate system), causing a small angular rotation in the directions of the X- and Y-axes 
between two coordinate systems. EXC, EYC, EZC, EAC, EBC, and ECC are six component errors for the 
C-axis. Finally, )sin( ECCCS mce += , )cos( ECCCC mce += , and mC is the servo-controlled position 
of the C servo-axis. 
In Equation (2), the first matrix is the kinematic parameter matrix for the offset in origin between 
two coordinate systems; the second matrix is the location error matrix for the C rotary-axis; and the third 
matrix is the component error matrix for the C rotary-axis. Thus, the C rotary-axis has ten geometric 
errors.

2.2 Error model for R-test measuring in five-axis machine tools 
Fig. 3 illustrates the investigated five-axis milling machine and its coordinate systems. The whole 
machine is modeled as a kinematic chain with several links connected in series by prismatic and 
rotational joints. At one end of the chain is the 3D measuring probe mounted on the spindle. The spindle 
block is mounted on the Z-slide. The Z-slide moves vertically on the Y-table with a prismatic joint. The 
Y-table moves on the machine column with a prismatic joint too. 
At the other end, the kinematic chain begins with the master ball which is fixed on the C-turntable.

where the pXΔ , pYΔ  and pZΔ  are the deviations in the probe coordinate system. Explicit expressions 
of the measured errors can be obtained after carrying out the matrix multiplications and neglecting the 
second and higher order errors as Table 1. 
Table 1 show that the overall error in the direction of the X-axis, pXΔ , is the product of each error 
multiplied by the error gain of each error. For example, the error contribution in the X-axis direction in 
EBX is EBX* )******( wawcawcacaa ZCYCSXSSZCZ −−−−+ . This table, which is considered a 
geometric error sensitivity analysis table, indicates that translational errors (such as EXX, EYX… ) are 
machine kinematic parameter-independent, while rotational errors (such as EAX, EBX,… ) are machine 
kinematic parameter-dependent.

The block diagram of parameter estimation is shown in Figure 5. The parameters of the five-axis 
milling machine tool are calibrated and are shown in Table 3. The five-axis milling machine tool is tested 
with three different test paths: the K1, K2 and K4. As can be seen in Table 2, the K4 test path, which all 
five axes driven simultaneously, is ideal in estimating error measurement to effectively calculate all errors. 
Therefore, the K4 test path is used for estimation and the K1,K2 paths are used for justification. The 
overall position errors and the setting positions jp  of each error sampling are registered for the purpose 
of error estimation. The total number of samples for K4 is 241. K1 is 361, and K2 is 121.

After the measurements, the values of error gain functions )(, jxif p , )(, jyif p  and )(, jzif p  in 
the error gain matrix H are computed for each setting position jp . The elements of the measurement 
vector q  are obtained through R-test measuring for each setting position jp . With the error gain matrix 
H and the measurement vector q known, the unknown error parameter vector a~  is obtained through 
solving Eq. (26) directly with the help of the mathematical tool software MATLAB. The solution of error 
parameter vector a~  involves great amount of computation with matrices and arrays. No iteration is 
necessary.  
Figure 6 is shown the R-test measurement in the target five-axis machine tool with Heidenhain iTNC 
530 controller, and the results of estimation based on the test K4 is shown in Table 4. For the sake of 
justification, the estimated location errors of rotary axes and ball position errors are set into the error 
model to compute the overall position errors along the K4 test path. The results are shown in Figure 7. 
The predicted and the really measured overall position errors are very close. The deviations in X-, Y- and 
Z-axis are in the range of ±12μm. To justify the effectiveness of the estimation further, the predicted and 
measured position errors along two different tests path K1 and K2 are also compared. The results are 
shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. With these test paths, the global tendency matches also very good. The 
deviations are greater and rise to the range of ±15μm.  
5. Conclusion 
The error modeling technique is very useful in predicting the volumetric errors of CNC machine 
tools. Until now the implementation of this technique in five-axis machine tools faces great problems. 
Although the majority of component errors in the error model are measurable with modern measurement 
devices, there are still some component and location errors of the rotary axes that are not measurable. 
In recent years, ISO/10791-6 has defined the error test methods for five-axis machine tools, and

related to the three-axis kinematic parameters where the overall errors 
was relative to the machine reference coordinate system. Given that the 
measurement of the linear axis in this model should be on the ideal 
motion axis, there were practical difficulties. Through a measurement 
method consolidating translational errors and rotational errors in the 
geometric error model, we simplified the three-axis geometric error 
model to a kinematic parameter-independent model. Finally, based on 
the new measurement method and compensation corresponding to this 
error model, we established a truly practical and more accurate error 
compensation technique for three-axis machine tools.

II.DEFINING GEOMETRIC ERRORS FOR LINEAR AXES
Definitions in ISO230 related to error inspection standards
for CNC machine tools include the definition for geometric
errors and the method for test. A single linear motion axis is
defined to possess six component errors(three translational
errors and three rotational errors), and a location
(perpendicularity) error exists between two linear motion axes.
According to the above definitions, a three-axis machine tool
with three linear axes would have a total of 21 geometric errors.
To describe three-axis machine tool geometric overall errors, it
is necessary to establish a geometric error model for the target
machine. Assuming the structure of the machine tool is a rigid
body, then a 4x4 HTM could be used to show the relationship
between each kinematic and servo control axis, and the machine
error model could go through an individual kinematic and driver
components HTM to obtain the order of products, depending on
the machine kinematic chain [1].
Fig. 1 displays a case study for the X-axis linear motion slide.
The geometric error model for kinematic parameters, location
errors, and component errors in X-axis linear slide, showing the
relationship of the x coordinate system with respect to the
reference coordinate system x
rT , is shown in the formula below.

where xxx ZYX ,, are the constant offset which the x home
position with respect to the reference coordinate system in the
x,y,z direction respectively, or the kinematic parameter for
X-axes linear slide. COX is the location error between linear X
axis and an ideal linear axis (in this example, Y-axis of the
reference coordinate system) which will cause a small angular
rotation at between two coordinate systems at the Z axial
direction. EXX, EYX, EZX, EAX, EBX and ECX are the six
component errors for linear X axis, and mX is the
servo-controlled position of the X-axis slide.
The order of products for the kinematic parameter matrix, the
location (perpendicularity) error matrix, and the 6D component
error matrix in the above formula is dependent upon the pattern
arrangement in linear X axis’s kinematic chain. First the 6D
component errors matrix for the X axis linear slide. And
assuming that when the X-axis slide goes home position the
Z-axis of the X coordinate system is identical with the Z-axis of
the reference coordinate system, then perpendicular error COX
exists between the ideal motion axis (the X-axis of the X
coordinate system) and the Y-axis of the reference coordinate
system, and so does the perpendicularity error matrix. When X
axis slide moves to the X home position, the X axis slide having
the kinematic parameter matrix for the origin coordinate offsets.

III. MODELING AND MEASUREMENT WITH KINEMATIC
PARAMETER-INDEPENDENCE
A. Geometric Error Modeling
For an ideal three-axis machine tool, each tool position
( www ZYX ,, ) and orientation ( www KJI ,, ) on the workpiece
coordinate system for the three machine motion axes has a
corresponding drive position to cut the needed work pieces and
the tool orientation can only be defined on the (0,0,1) direction.
Fig. 2 is the three-axis machine tool (Coordinate Measuring
Machine, CMM) and its coordinating system definition. The
machine’s kinematic chain is linked by several link components
and three linear motion axes. One end of the chain is a tool
holder and the holder should hold the tool. The spindle block is
mounted on the Z-slide. The Z-slide moves vertically with a
prismatic joint. The Z-slide is bolted on the X-slide and the
X-slide is then stacked on the Y-slide, making the three linear
axes (x,y,z) perpendicular to each other. Y-slide is then moves
on the beds with a prismatic joint. Finally, based on the ISO230
definition and this machine’s kinematic chain sequence, the
location errors are COX, BOZ, and AOZ.
Based on Fig. 3, the relationship of the tool (T) coordinate
system with respect to the holder (H) coordinate system, t

Using small-angle approximations assumption and the
second-order errors are negligible, and consolidating the
geometric errors, the geometric error model for this three-axis
machine tool is displayed in Table I. The overall error for the
direction of X, rX , is the product of each error multiplied by
each error’s error gain. For example, the error contribution for
the direction of X in ECX is –ECX* zY . This table, which is
considered a geometric error sensitivity analysis table, indicates
that linear errors (EXX, EYX, EZX, EXY, EYY, EZY, EXZ, EYZ,
and EZZ) are machine kinematic parameter-independent, while
rotary errors (EAX, EBX, ECX, EAY, EBY, ECY, EAZ, EBZ,
ECZ, COX, AOZ, and BOZ) are machine kinematic
parameter-dependent.

B. Measurement for Kinematic Parameter-independent
In defining geometric errors and deducing formulas above,
the three-axis machine tool linear axis was structured by
kinematic stacking and each motion axis had a home position.
For this reason, kinematic parameters were necessary between
linear axis coordinate systems to effectively describe their
movement relative to each other. However, in practice, the
position of the ideal motion axis line for the linear motion slide
was difficult to clearly define. Moreover, to avoid Abbe’s error,
the measurement device must be placed on this axis line when
measuring. This requirement creates practical measurement
difficulties if the linear motion slide is at a high position or there
is interference. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a new
measurement method for a geometric error model without
kinematic parameter.
Ideally, the geometric error model coordinate system should
be set up on the ideal motion axis line for the linear slide to

positioning repeatability, we can assume that when X axis slide
is located at a specified position, the zz XY , kinematic
parameter will be a constant. Due to the fact that the reflection
mirror was installed at the tool end of the spindle, the error
contribution of EAX* zY  and EBX* )( zX will be reflected in
EZX. For this reason, these two kinematic parameters can be set
to zero, and their other errors can be simplified in this way.
As Table II illustrates, all nine translational errors (EXX,
EYX, EZX, EXY, EYY, EZY, EXZ, EYZ and EZZ) contribute to
the tool end overall errors, but only five of the rotational errors
(EAX, EBX, EAY, EBY and ECY) contribute while four (ECX,
EAZ, EBZ and ECZ) do not. Therefore, only 17 (21-4)
geometric errors need to be measured in this model.  Also in
Table II, considering the home positions for X, Y and Z motion
axes in this model, the error gains for EAY, EBY, and ECY
require revision to properly express the total physical
significance of kinematic parameter. Xs, Ys, and Zs represent the
stroke for X, Y, and Z linear motion axes, respectively.

Constructing a kinematic parameter-independent three-axis
geometric error model and measurement method based on the
above measuring method is both practical and accurate.
Furthermore, compensating for persistent geometric errors can
also be facilitated by using this geometric error model to
establish a geometric error compensation model to effectively
compensate for three-axis geometric errors. The three-axis
machine tool geometric error compensation scheme is displayed
in Fig. 5. First, a laser interferometer device based on the above
measurement construction method was used to measure the 21
geometric errors in the three axes. The measurement data was
used to carry out coordinate translational, aligning it with the
error model coordinate system. The measurement results were
then plugged into the three-axis kinematic
parameter-independent error model. The results indicated that
when the three-axis machine tool moved to u(x,y,z) and the tool
end spatial errors are du, then the compensation applied by the
kinematic parameter-independent error compensation model is
–du. Finally, the x,y,z motion axis direction errors,
compensated through a controller, were returned to their ideal
position at cu .

IV. CONCLUSION
The three-axis geometric error models derived by traditional
methods all set the machine reference coordinate system at a
fixed point on the machine’s base and depend on the machine
kinematic chain to derive a machine kinematic
parameter-dependent model. For practical applications, this
dependence makes kinematic parameters impossible to
accurately obtain, measurement device operations inconvenient,
and overall errors overvalued. For this reason, this paper created
a measurement method-integrated “modeling for geometric
error model of three-axis machine tools with kinematic
parameter independent” technique. This technique, which
integrated simple geometric error measuring methods, which
constructed the corresponding three-axis geometric error
model, and whose geometric error model is machine kinematic
parameter-independent, is a practical, convenient, and accurate
integrated three-axis geometric error modeling and
measurement method.

技術說明
(中文) 本技術是應用 R-test量具進行五軸工具機的轉動軸的位置幾何誤差項鑑定。CNC
數控工具機的誤差模型描述個別幾何誤差項與機器總成誤差間的關係，現今已可
應用R-test量具直接量測到五軸工具機的總成誤差，若個別幾何誤差項為已知，
則此時可應用幾何誤差模型預測幾何誤差藉此實現誤差補償。因此，本論文中依
ISO230的幾何誤差定義，完整的建立五軸工具機R-test量具幾何誤差模型，並依
此一模型,在只考量轉動軸的位置誤差(location error)前題下，簡化五軸幾何
誤差模型。接著基於簡化模型及以R-test量具進行K4量測路徑的量測結果，可應
用最小平方法精確估測旋轉軸的位置誤差項。最後並以路徑K1及路徑K2有效驗證
誤差模型及鑑定方法的正確性，則此建立之誤差模型可應用於誤差補償以提升機
器精度。
(英文) The technique is to use an R-test measurement device to estimate the geometric location 
error of the axis of rotation of five-axis machine tools. Now, the R-test measuring device 
can be used to measure the overall position errors of five-axis machine tools directly. To 
improve the accuracy of CNC machine tools, error sources and its effects on the overall 
position and orientation errors must be known. 
This study thus based its definition on the geometric errors of ISO230 to construct a 
geometric error model used to measure errors in the five-axis machine tools for the R-test 
measurement device. Based on the simplified model and the overall position errors 
measured by the R-test with path K4, the location errors of rotary axes and ball position 
errors can be estimated very accurately with the least square estimation method. Finally, 
the results of the test showed that the model built in this study is accurate and is effective 
in estimating errors.
