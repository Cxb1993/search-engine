Validation with Single Particles and Z->µµ 
 
After misaligning the detector the next step was to validate it with single particles 
and physics samples like Z->µµ. Fig. 1 shows the reconstructed momentum of 100 GeV 
muons in the Inner detector. The black histogram is obtained using the nominal Inner 
Detector where the blue is the one obtained with the misaligned TRT. It is clear that with 
the TRT misalignment the distribution of reconstructed momentum is deteriorated. The 
plot is generated using Atlas software release 12.0.0.

histogram is obtained with nominal ID and blue with TRT misaligned. 
 
Distribution of reconstructed moment for different ID setups validated with physics 
sample Z->µµ is shown in Fig. 2. The black histogram is obtained with the nominal ID 
setup, the red histogram with only TRT misaligned, the blue is obtained with silicon and 
TRT both misaligned and the green is obtained with silicon plus TRT misaligned but with 
increase in error scaling during reconstruction. It is clear that silicon misalignment has 
dominant effect on reconstructed momentum. The increase in error scaling by a factor of 
10 does not improve track reconstruction. 
 
The Z->µµ invariant mass is shown in Fig. 3. The green color denote the invariant mass 
with nominal simulation, blue color is the invariant with misaligned TRT, pink with ID

  Due to the hostile space environment at ISS, common electronic components
which works normally on the Earth may malfunction or even totally  out of
order in the space, this will be a great challenge because in space experiment
we  can  not  tolerate  any  failure.  So  doing  beam  test  and  Monte  Carlo
simulation to study the effects of high energy charge particles in space on the
electronic components is absolutely necessary.
  The effect of the total ionizing radiation dose(600 Rads/year) was measured
for all key components and found to be negligible. However, a much larger
concern is heavy ion induced single event effects, including destructive latch
ups or gate ruptures and bit flipping upsets. Careful research must be done to
select candidate of high speed, low power components. A series of beam test
was done .  The main challenges for electronics in space such as:
Static Loads to = 40+10+10 g
Random Vibration to 6.3g(rms)
Pressure: 0.0 to 18.0 psi
Vaccum
Thermal Ranges: Storage: -40 to +80 C, Operation: -30 to +60C
Radiation Dose(ISS): ~kilorad/year.
Heavy Ion single event effects: upsets, latch-ups
Lifetime: 1 year test, 3+ years no access
Will all make it great different with respect to experiments on the Earth.
  
  We are setting up codes for  the  cosmic  ray  simulation on this  purpose,
namely to study the SEE(Single Event Effects) in electronics components of
AMS DAQ. Different primary particles and nuclei like proton, electron, helium
and other heavier components in the primary cosmic ray will be simulated in
the program on this effects. Fluxes on ISS are calculated using the CREAM96
Monte  Carlo  program.  Geant3(Geant4)  program  will  assist  us  to  simulate
particles transportations inside the ACOP. Monte Carlo  Simulation of cosmic
ray incident on to ACOP is undertaken.  Code to generate cosmic ray spectra
of various particles such as sea level muon, radiation belts electron, albedo
proton and electron, cosmic proton, electron/positron, anti-proton and  heavy
ions etc. Also need to take into account the simulation of the ISS movement on
the predefined orbit. Geant3/Geant4 code is integrated into program for the
detailed simulation of particle interaction and development inside the box. 
  We expect to find out which components in the primary cosmic ray spectrum
are most harmful  to the electronic components  like CPU, Host/PCI  bridge,
SDRAM 512 Mbit, SSRAM. The results of this study should give us a base on
the selection of these components of ACOP and therefore contribute to the
AMS-02 project on our side.
misaligned and black is ID misaligned with increased error scaling at reconstruction level. 
The effect of silicon misalignment is dominant in Fig. 3. It can be seen that due to the 
silicon misalignment the ID is no more able to reconstruct Z->µµ. This will be the 
situation with the first day real data taking and therefore the alignment of the detector is 
essential. I reported this work in different meetings[1-6]. Also an Atlas note about this 
work is under preparation. The note will be submitted in two weeks time. More details 
can be found under www.cern.ch/aahmad.

AMS-02 Work Report for May 2006 - Aug 2006
Jiawei Zhao
Academia Sinica, Taiwan
Aug 31, 2006
In order to build the electronics that can run for
space experiment like AMS-02 (Fig 1), the radiation
environment on space need to be fully understood.
Based on this understanding, a proper test beam line
can be setup to simulate the space environment and
used to select/test various components for this instru-
ment with proper beam type, intensity for a sufficient
period of time.
Figure 1: AMS02 structure (from R.Becker, Nov
2004)
The cosmic radiation at space is at a much higher
level than the normal environment on earth surface
due to the absence of atmosphere absorption and the
protection of the earth magnet field. The compo-
nents of cosmic radiation (Fig 3) on space (85% pro-
tons, 14% of alpha particles, and 1% of heavy ions,
together with ultraviolet radiation and x-rays) is also
very different from the muon dominant composition
on earth. The solar activity has a modulation effect
on the cosmic radiation, and in case of a sun flare
happens, a very high number of energetic particles
can be generated and increase the cosmic radiation
level greatly. The electronic components to be used
on space therefore will face a very harsh and differ-
ent environement than normal one. Cosmic parti-
cles interact with the electronic component and do
damage with both cumulative and single event effect.
Hadrons can displace atoms in the silicon lattice so
creating lasting damage. The total ionizing dose will
increase the leakage currents of the electronic com-
ponent, and single high ionizing particles and ener-
getic hadrons can produce sufficient charges locally
in the circuit and disturb its operation. Therefore
the computer to be used on space must be able to
stand all these effects by using radiation hard design.
The AMS-02 is expected to be mounted on the In-
ternational Space station (Fig 2). The environment
around the electronics can change the local radiation
composition, and its effects should also be considered.
We had been working on to understand the cos-
mic radiation environment and how it would affect
the computer operation. Various measurements had
been done before (for eg, AMS-01, Fig 4) on the en-
ergy spectrum and composition of cosmic radiation.
Based on these measurements, we can estimate the
total ionization dose of each important component of
the computer and put these components under test
using a test beam facility. Using Monte Carlo simu-
lation technique, we can also estimate the probability
of a single event effect will happen and how well the
fault tolerant/correction design can stand it. This ef-
fect is also put under test with the test beam. By
comparing the test beam result and the simulation
estimation, we can estimate the reliability and fault
rate of the computer build with the selected compo-
nents and also improve the MC simulation further.
The MC simulation is based on the highly advanced
Geant4 Monte Carlo library, which can simulate the
interaction of high energy particles with material very
accurately including trace on the secondary particles
down to the lowest relavant energy level.
This work is also carried on together with the
Monte Carlo study of cosmic ray detection with AT-
LAS detector, because the space cosmic will generate
what got measured at ATLAS level after propagation.
The understanding of the initial cosmic component
therefore can be used as input for the ATLAS study
also.
We have studied the energy loss of cosmic muons
in the overburden above ATLAS detector. For a cos-

mic muon with 100 GeV energy on the surface shoot
vertically towards the ATLAS detector center, it will
be deviated from the straight line extrapolation when
reaching ATLAS due to multiple scattering (as in Fig
5) and the total energy loss be like a Landau distri-
bution as in Fig 6).
For continum initial energy spectrum and shooting
angle, the energy loss situation is further complicated
by the complex material distribution pattern above
the detector. In this situation, the overall energy loss
for the continum spectrum will be like Fig 7, which
have also tails in the low end because of the possibility
of particles pass through the elevatorn tunnel (Fig
8) and loose very few energy. The average energy
loss and spreading is also different for different initial
cosmic energy (Fig 9).
From this we can see that the energy loss is sig-
naficant compared to the original muon energy, so to
measure the original muon flux will require a com-
plete understanding of the energy loss for muon with
all interested energy range and shooting directions.
This energy loss, spreading problem is usually solved
with the construction of a energy loss table, which
by using Monte Carlo simulation technique, the ef-
ficiency and mixing probability for each sub energy
range can be obtained. The origianl flux can then

Summary Report 
 
Ashfaq Ahmad 
05/01/2007 
 
Since May this year I have been working on the preparation and validation of the as-built 
geometry of the Inner Detector for the Computing System Commissioning (CSC) and 
Calibration Data Challenge (CDC). The CSC and CDC are intended to test the alignment 
and calibration algorithms with an imperfect (realistic) detector description of the Atlas 
experiment. Specifically for the Inner Detector, the as built geometry includes 
misalignment of the different subsystems, distorted material and distorted (tilted and 
shifted) magnetic field. 
 
The exercise is foreseen to be a closed-loop, where the alignment and calibration 
procedures will be computed after the reconstruction on a miscalibrated and misaligned 
simulated detector. Starting with imperfectly known constants, a first set of calibration 
and alignment parameters is derived and then applied in a subsequent data reconstruction. 
A new set of constants is then determined and the process repeated again. The 
performance of the detector (track parameters, fit quality, residual distributions, etc.) is 
expected to improve in successive reconstruction passes. 
 
To produce as-built geometry for the Inner Detector I misaligned the Transition Radiation 
Tracker (TRT) at two levels; 
 
i. Module level misalignment 
 
For the TRT barrel modules, the in-plane translations are generated randomly from 
a flat distribution centered at zero and widths of ±200um, ±100um and ±300um 
respectively for layer 0, 1 and 2. For the out-of-plane translations, a systematic 
radial shift of +1mm, -0.5mm and 1.5mm are applied for modules in layer 0, 1 and 
2 respectively. Misalignment numbers are summarized in table. 1. 
 
ii. Global TRT misalignment 
 
TRT barrel and two endcaps (Endcap A and C) are both shifted in X, Y Z and 
rotated with the numbers given table. 2.

situation with the first day real data taking and therefore the alignment of the detector is

                                               Work Report 
                                                                   Zhou Suijian
  The AMS-02 Crew Operations Post(ACOP) is a key component in the AMS-02
experiment which scheduled to be launched and operated on the International
Space Station(ISS)  in the near future.  The primary  purpose of ACOP is  to
provide  a  large  memory  space  to  record  AMS-02  experiment  data  and  to
provide  a  crew  monitoring  and  control  mechanism  for  the  attached  site
payload.   ACOP is  powered  and  active  whenever  AMS-02  is  active  and  it
maintains an active bi-directional connection via the HRDL interface to AMS-
02 at all times. All data transmitted by AMS-02 is recorded onto ACOP's hard
drives  as  a  master copy of  the  AMS-02 science data.  The planned 4  hard
drives installed in ACOP provide an estimated 20 days of recording and the 4
installed hard drives will require periodic replacement by the ISS crew from
the on board stock of empty drives. To successfully complete the task of AMS-
02, ACOP must meet the following requirements:
1. Operate effectively in the ISS space environment.
2.  Create an on-orbit  recording of all  AMS-02 science data on removable1
media-explicitly hard drives, preferably SATA based.
3.  Provide  not  less  than  20  days  of  recording  capacity  without  crew
intervention (based on 2Mbit/second rates), longer would be better.
4. Provide not less than 120 days of recording media capacity within a single
mid deck locker equivalent storage unit, longer would be better.
5. Recorded data is an archive. Disks must be provided for the entire 3+ year
mission without overwriting (a total of ~23 TByte).
6. For recording ACOP must support an orbital average data rate of not less
then 1 Hot swap software not required but performing a hardware hot swap
must not permanently damage the system 4Mbit/second with bursts of up to
20 Mbit/second.
7. Provide a continuous operations display of ad hoc AMS-02 data for the ISS
crew to monitor.
8. Provide a continuous means for the ISS crew to issue ad hoc predefined
commands without external equipment.
9. Provide, as needed, an exhaustive diagnostic, monitoring and operations
environment via the EXPRESS laptop computer.
10. Support the playback of recorded data to ground systems at selectable
data  rates  up  to  at  least  20Mbits/second  sustained  while  simultaneously
recording at prescribed rates.
11. Support ACOP to AMS-02 commanding at selectable data rates up to at
least 20Mbits/second sustained. (No requirement for simultaneous recording
or playback operations at higher rates.)
12.Support  an  alternate  AMS-02  ground  commanding  and  housekeeping
report path via the HRDL interface.
13. CompactPCI based. Preferably 6U form factor.
14. Crew serviceable for upgrades and repairs - hardware and software.
15. Provide for upgrades and expansion to ACOP using COTS subsystems.
   Careful materials selection, particularly of the cabling and connectors, and
the housing design, avoid problems due to vacuum, free atomic oxygen, solar
UV  radiation  and  impacts  from  micrometeorites  and  orbital debris.  Much
effort was spent on ensuring that the electronics will perform without physical
intervention over the three year mission.

Validation with Single Particles and Z->µµ 
 
After misaligning the detector the next step was to validate it with single particles 
and physics samples like Z->µµ. Fig. 1 shows the reconstructed momentum of 100 GeV 
muons in the Inner detector. The black histogram is obtained using the nominal Inner 
Detector where the blue is the one obtained with the misaligned TRT. It is clear that with 
the TRT misalignment the distribution of reconstructed momentum is deteriorated. The 
plot is generated using Atlas software release 12.0.0.  
 
 
 
Figure 1: Reconstucted momentum for 100 GeV single muon in Atlas Inner Detector (ID). Black 
histogram is obtained with nominal ID and blue with TRT misaligned. 
 
Distribution of reconstructed moment for different ID setups validated with physics 
sample Z->µµ is shown in Fig. 2. The black histogram is obtained with the nominal ID 
setup, the red histogram with only TRT misaligned, the blue is obtained with silicon and 
TRT both misaligned and the green is obtained with silicon plus TRT misaligned but with 
increase in error scaling during reconstruction. It is clear that silicon misalignment has 
dominant effect on reconstructed momentum. The increase in error scaling by a factor of 
10 does not improve track reconstruction. 
 
The Z->µµ invariant mass is shown in Fig. 3. The green color denote the invariant mass 
with nominal simulation, blue color is the invariant with misaligned TRT, pink with ID

Conversion Efficiency Matrix of Original, Observed Cosmic Energy

The LHC data dating is expected to be started
very soon next year. Interesting physics will be re-
vealed with this very advanced experiment. Big ques-
tions concerned by every physicist could be answered.
Clearly it is interesting for us to consider also the
physics topics besides cosmic study. Standard model
study including topics like W mass measurement and
triple gauge coupling could be studied with suitable
amount of statistics after one or more years of data
taking. It will be also interesting to look at physics
beyond standard model, supersymmetry for exam-
ple. ATLAS colaboration has prepared a wide range
of Monte Carlo samples covering different physics
channels. To make these samples available to physi-
cists located at different institutes to study conve-
niently need special organized data management us-
ing GRID, which we have been contributing to its
operation inside the DDM subgroup.
We have looked the event selection of some physics
channels. The W → eν event is characterized with
a hight pt electron and a high missing Et (Fig 11).
The H → ZZ → llll events can be searched for with
events having 2 pairs of high pt leptons, e+e− or
µ+µ− (Fig 12 and 13). The event selection of these
channels should then make use of the distinct char-
acteristics of these events.
To study the Monte Carlo events generated, the
generator information of the particles need to be un-
derstood. We developed an utility to view the event
generator information as a diagram, to see the gener-
ate and decay sequences of particles. Such diagram
can be used as a guildline when transversing the MC
info tree. Fig 14 is such a diagram for a W → eν
event. We can zoom in the part concerning W de-
cay to have a more detailed view (Fig 15). From this
diagram, we can see that eν information is stored
twice in the decay tree, which can be either a bug
or a special feature need to be taken care of when
try to get the eν information from W decay. This
double copy problem seems to be common for other
ATLAS Pythia Monte Carlo samples, for example the
W → τν sample and the H → ZZ → 4l sample (Fig
16 and 17).

event in η − φ plane. The green line stands for the
electron, white line for neutrino.

1. 5月 21日至 5月 25日是 NASA對 AMS-02的 PhaseII Safety 
Review。AMS-02提交了 1000多頁的報告。Safety Review在
Houston的 Johnson Space Center舉行，但參與審查的人員由
NASA的各中心派來，包括加州的 Jet Propulsion Lab，馬里蘭
州的 Goddard Space Center等，因此丁院士也趁此機會向參與
人員介紹 AMS-02實驗的物理目標，目前進度及預定時程。 
2. 由於 AMS-02 準備充分，且代表 AMS-02 的 NASA 的 AMS 
Project Office雨 AMS-02密切合作，先前針對此 Safety Review
已有多次預演，因此審查非常順利，提早在星期四下午結束，
AMS-02 通過重要的 PhaseII 安全審查，而且審查結果有三項
需追蹤的工作(action items)都是 NASA 方面需處理的問題，
AMS-02實驗組不需有任何工作。這也是 NASA史上從來發生
過的。 
3. 在會議期間，AMS-02各國代表與 JSC前任的 Director George 
Abbey 有多次接觸。George Abbey 是國際太空站(ISS)的原始
推動者，非常支持在 ISS 上從事國際合作的科學實驗特別是
AMS。在他的支持下，各國代表於星期五下午與德州眾議員
Nicholas Lampson見面，向其簡報 AMS-02實驗。美國前 NSF
