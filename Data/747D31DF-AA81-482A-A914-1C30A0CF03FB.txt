Abstract 
Novel epoxy-based semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs) of aromatic 
polyimide, derived from 2,2 -benzidinedisulfonic acid (BDSA), were prepared 
through a thermal imidization reaction. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were employed utilized to and verify 
the synchronization of the imidization of sulfonated poly(amic acid) (SPAA) and the 
crosslinking reactions of epoxy. The semi-IPNs of epoxy/sulfonated polyimides 
(SPI-EPX) exhibit excellent film-forming characteristics and mechanical integrity, as 
well as a high modulus at room temperature. Conductivities at 100 ℃ of 0.0243 S. 
cm-1 (SPI-EP30) and 0.0141 S. cm-1 (SPI-EP50) were obtained, which values are 
similar to that of the Nafion 117 control (0.0287 S. cm-1). The increase in the 
conductivity of SPI-EP(30.40) with temperature is more rapid than is that of Nafion 
117. The proton conductivities of the SPI-EP membranes depended significantly on 
the ion exchange capacity (IEC) at high temperature (50~100℃). The SPI-EPX 
exhibited lower methanol permeabilitity than did Nafion117. The microstructure was 
analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode, which 
demonstrated that SPI-EP exhibited a nanophase that was separated into an essentially 
reticulated and venous hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. TEM confirmed 
widespread and well-connected hydrophilic domains, proving the strong 
1. Introduction 
Fuel cells are efficient devices that efficiently generate electric power in a chemical 
reaction between fuel and oxygen. They have therefore attracted increasing attention 
as clean electric power sources [1~2]. A highly conductive, stable proton-conducting 
membrane is one of the most important elements of a highly performing high polymer 
electrolyte fuel cell (PEFCs). As a typical candidate such as Poly(perfluorosulfonic 
acid) (Nafion®), Poly(perfluorosulfonic acid) membranes are the most successfully 
used polymeric materials in practical PEFCs applications. The poly(perfluorosulfonic 
acid) membrane Nafion® is commonly used as an electrolyte in DMFCs, because of 
its favorable chemical and thermal resistance and ionic conductivity. However, the 
perfluorosulfonic acid polymers have some disadvantages such as high cost, low 
application temperature (<80 ℃) and a large amount of methanol-crossover in direct 
methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications [3,4]. This methanol permeability causes 
conversion losses, in the form of lost fuel and depolarization losses at the cathode, 
resulting in poor overall fuel cell performance. This fact has stimulated the 
development of research on alternative low-cost and high-performance nonfluorinated 
polymeric proton-conducting materials. Various sulfonated aromatic polymer 
membranes (partially perfluorinated [5-6] and nonperfluorinated [7-15]) have been 
synthesized and tested for use in fuel cell applications. They are typically synthesized 
of polyimides include (1) incorporating flexible linkages into monomers; [21] (2) 
incorporating monomers that do not have both a sulfonic acid group and an amine 
group in a single ring [22] (3) using diamines with high nucleophilicity, [23] (4) using 
alkane diamines, [24] (5) using napthalenic dianhydrides, [25,26] and (6) using diamines 
that have a sulfonic acid group in their side chains.[27]  Furthermore, one of the easy 
approaches for improving hydrolytic stability involves crosslinking. Rigid arylene 
polymers become brittle whenever crosslinked, and crosslinking is expected to reduce 
proton conductivity. Fortunately, semi-interpenetrating polymer networks can be 
formed without compromising on proton conductivity and brittleness. These methods 
improve hydrolytic stability, reducing methanol crossover. They also improve the 
mechanical stability and proton conductivity of the membrane in water. 
This investigation studies the synthesis and properties of a series of thin films of 
epoxy-based semi-IPNs of sulfonated polyimide. The semi-IPNs of sulfonated 
polyimide membranes must be cross-linked by epoxy to ensure physical and chemical 
stability in the presence of water, providing high hydrolytic stability, high proton 
conductivity, good mechanical strength and low membrane swelling. The methanol 
permeability, morphology and moisture of are analyzed and discussed in this work.
temperature for 24 h. The sulfonated polyimide (SPI) film was prepared by casting on 
a glass plate with 8.5 wt.% of sulfonated poly(amic acid)(SPAA). It was thermally 
imidized (by OR via) evaporation of the solvent and the imidization reaction 
proceeded as follows. After it had been dried at 70 ℃ for 6 h in an oven, the films 
were thermally imidized at an increased temperature of 150 ℃ for 3 h and 180℃ for 6 
h. The wt.% of EPOWIDE in the (SPI-EP) was varied (Table 1). Calculated amounts 
of SPAA triethylammonium salt solution (8.5 wt.%, NMP/DMSO) and EPOWIDE 
were stirred using a magnetic stirrer in a nitrogen atmosphere at the ambient 
temperature for 24 h. The solutions were cast onto glass plates and cured at 70 ℃ for 
6 h, at 150 ℃ for 3 h and at 180 ℃ for 6 h. The flexible SPI and semi-IPN SPI 
membranes were detached from the glass plate, and then immersed in 1M H2SO4 
overnight to convert the salt form of BDSA-Et3HN into its acid form, which was then 
washed several times using deionized water until a neutral pH was reached. Scheme 1 
presents the synthesis. 
2.3. Polymer Characterization 
2.3.1. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
The DSC data were obtained using a DuPont Q100 Modulated differential scanning 
calorimeter (MDSC) with a DSC model, purged with a nitrogen, and quenched with 
liquid nitrogen. The cell was calibrated using an indium standard. The mass of the 
broadband proton decoupling and normal cross-polarization pulse sequencing. A 
magic angle sample spinning (MAS) rate of 5.4 kHz was used to eliminate resonance 
broadening that was caused by the anisotropy of chemical shift tensors. 
2.4. Ion Exchange Capacity (IEC) 
The ion exchange capacity (also known as the IEC value) was measured (using 
the classical titration technique. After the samples had been immersed in distilled 
water, they were soaked in a large volume of 1M H2SO4 solution to change them into 
the H+ form. The samples were then washed in distilled water to remove excess 
H2SO4, and then equilibrated by adding 150 ml of 0.1M NaCl solution for 48h. The 
remaining liquid was titrated using 0.1M NaOH solution with phenolphthalein as an 
indicator. The IEC value was recorded as an average value for each sample in units of 
milliequivalents NaOH per gram of the polymer (mmol/g). 
2.5. Measurement Proton Conductivity  
The measurements of proton conductivity of the membranes were made after 
(they OR the membranes )  had been soaked in deionized water for one day at 30 ℃. 
An impedance spectrum was obtained from 10MHz to 100 Hz using an Autolab 
PGSTAT30 Impedance Analyzer. A cell geometry that ensured that the membrane 
resistance dominated the response of the system was used. The resistance of the 
membrane was measured at the frequency that minimized the imaginary response. All 
10wt. % methanol solution in deionized water. The other (VB) was filled with distilled 
water. The membrane (with an effective area of 2.986cm2) was clamped between the 
two compartments, in which the liquid was stirred during the experiment. A flux of 
methanol passed across the membrane as a result of the difference between the 
concentrations in the two compartments). Under pseudo steady-state conditions, 
which obtained during the experiment and for CB≫CA, the methanol concentration in 
the receiving compartment is given as a function by the following equation).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of SPI-EP 
Since the sulfonated polyimide (SPI) that is generated by the imidization of the 
sulfonated polyamic acid (SPAA) is insoluble in the epoxy oligomer or solutions 
thereof, the SPAA reaction solution, as described above, was mixed with the 
epoxy-SPAA with rapid stirring for 24 hours, until a homogeneous solution was 
obtained. Therefore, A clear and homogeneous solution was formed when the SPAA 
was mixed with EPOWIDE at room temperature, suggesting high compatibility 
between the two polymers. 
Since epoxy systems are cured mostly by an epoxide ring-opening reaction with 
primary and secondary amines and with carboxylic and hydroxyl groups, the systems 
herein were presumed to be cured by the reactions of these groups in the sulfonated 
polyamic acid oligomers and the concurrent competing imidization of the sulfonated 
polyamic acid. Also, the epoxy with the generated hydroxyl groups, the so-called 
etherification of the epoxy and epoxy/tertiary amine-catalyzed reactions were 
considered. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), augmented by FT-IR, revealed the 
interactions of the reaction components during curing. Possible complex reaction 
mechanisms for this particular system are suggested. Based on DSC, the activation 
energies and the heats of reaction associated with the epoxy and the primary, 
large (SPI-EP65). The following section presents a possible reaction mechanism 
(Scheme1) for the epoxy-based semi-IPNs of sulfonated polyimide (SPI-EP) to 
onfirm the synchronization of imidization of SPAA and the crosslinking reactions of 
EPOWIDE. 
3.1.2. FT-IR 
Figure 2 presents the FT-IR spectra of SPI-EP50 at various temperatures. The 
FT-IR spectra were employed to investigate the effect of curing temperature on 
imidization. The spectra of the components were obtained initially to identify 
characteristic peaks. Several distinct peaks are clearly observed. They corresponded to 
symmetric and asymmetric imide υC=O bands at about 1778 and 1726 cm-1, 
respectively, δ(O=C-N) at 726 cm-1, and imide υC-N bands at 1375 cm-1. at The peaks 
at 1205, 1031 and 1098cm1 correspond to the stretching vibration of the SO2 (Et3HN 
form). The peak associated with the amide υC=O bands at 1664 cm -1 declines as the 
curing temperature increases. As well as the typical imide peaks, others such as υC-N 
at 1375 cm-1, υC=O at 1726 and 1778 cm-1, δ(O=C-N) at 726 cm-1, are clearly visible 
in both spectra; the changes in the peak intensities were hard to quantify, confirming 
that the network of the SPAA and EPOWIDE does not inhibit the formation of the 
SPI.  
 
a reaction with primary or secondary amides and upon a reaction of the carboxylic 
groups of the SPAA. In the higher temperature range, the imidization of the SPAA is 
accompanied by the subsequent breaking of some of the bonds that formed between 
the SPAA and epoxy, producing three-dimensional epoxy network fragments, an 
extension of the epoxy network itself via hydroxyl crosslinking reactions of these 
newly created network fragments, and also the possible imide-catalyzed 
homopolymerization of the unreacted epoxide rings. 
 
3.2. Properties of SPI-EPX Membranes 
3.2.1. IEC, water uptake and proton conductivity 
The water content of the sulfonated polymers is a very important factor that directly 
influences their mechanical properties and the transport of protons across membranes 
made of such polymers. Protons can be transported in hydrogen-bonded ionic 
channels, along with such cationic mixtures as H3O+, H5O2+ and H9O4+, in the water 
medium. [28, 29] In a fully hydrated state, sulfonated polymers may be dissociated to 
produce immobile sulfonic acid groups and mobile protons in aqueous solution. The 
free protons thus formed move through a localized ionic network within fully 
water-swollen sulfonated polymer membranes. Accordingly, a suitable water content 
should be maintained in sulfonated polymer membranes to ensure high proton 
ether groups increased.  The proton conductivity of the SPI-EPX and Nafion117 was 
measured as the temperature increased, and is plotted in Fig.4. The proton 
conductivity of all of the SPI-EPX films increased with the temperature, but 
decreased as the EPOWIDE content increased. Proton conductivity generally 
increases with IEC and water uptake and declines with crosslinking. This result is of 
interest because proton conductivity increased, even though EPOWIDE content 
decreased, as IEC increased. The ether group was clearly responsible for the slightly 
hydrophilic character of the cured EPOWIDE, because the water molecules and the 
polymeric matrix interact weakly with polar and ionic groups at high temperatures of 
up to about 100℃. The results reveal that the SPI-EPX maintains its hydronium ion 
complex at high temperature when the EPOWIDE content is low. However, the IEC 
strongly affected the proton conductivity of the SPI-EPX membranes at high 
temperature because the water molecules interacted strongly with the sulfonic acid. 
 
3.2.2. Activation energy and proton conductivity 
The conductivity of the SPI-EPX was measured with increasing temperature, and the 
results are presentedin Table 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. All of the SPI-EPX had a lower 
conductivity than Nafion117 at temperatures of under 100°C. As the temperature 
increases, SPI-EP30 had a similar conductivity at 80°C and SPI-EP30 had a similar 
SPI-EPX films is substantially lower than that through Nafion117 films. The 
permeability values of the compared membranes are 7.3×10-7 for SPI-EP50 and 
2.8×10-6 cm2 s-1 for Nafion117. The methanol permeabilities of SPI-EPX membranes 
decreased as the amount of EPOWIDE increased. This result indicates that an 
increase in EPOWIDE content increases the amount of crosslinking in the structure, 
reducing methanol permeabilitity. 
 
3.3. Microstructural Analysis 
3.3.1. AFM 
Tapping mode AFM has been employed to investigate the surface morphology 
and ionic domains of Nafion. [32] Like Nafion, the hybrid materials considered herein 
contain sulfonic acid groups that act as the main proton carriers. Therefore, Nafion 
was analyzed by tapping mode AFM to investigate the possibility of phase separation, 
which would facilitate proton-hopping in the electrolyte. Figure 7 displays the AFM 
topographic and phase images. Figures 7(a, b) display) the tapping-mode 
simultaneously acquired AFM topographic and phase images of Nafion117 and 
SPI-EP50 that had been previously immersed in water. The lighter regions of each 
image correspond to areas of greater stiffness.[33] Published AFM studies of Nafion 
117 reveal very similar phase data, with areas of light and dark.[32] Other researchers 
provides good contrast. Figure 8 displays a cross-sectional micrograph of the 
SPI-EP50 membrane. The darker regions represent localized hydrophilic ionic 
domains and the lighter regions represent the hydrophobic polyimide backbone. In the 
TEM image of SPI-EP50 (Fig. 8), larger (15-10 nm) and smaller (<5 nm) ionic 
clusters were both observed. This result is similar to that of Watanabe et al. [24, 36] The 
crosslinked EPOWIDE causes the formation of smaller and larger ionic clusters than 
those displayed in Fig. 8, resulting in a more effective proton transport pathway.

which puts another burden to the ever-increasing 
cost of fuel cell systems. Moreover, they also 
suffer from a decrease in proton conductivity at 
temperatures above 80 oC, high methanol 
crossover, and high electro-osmotic drag among 
other drawbacks[3,4]. It is also difficult to 
process when compared to common polymers, 
limiting its designs to a novel fuel cell. It is 
therefore necessary to investigate new classes of 
proton conducting polymer membranes that are 
not prone to derive such deleterious properties. 
There are two main stratagems to obtain proton 
conductive membranes with high performance 
temperature ( ＞ 60 ℃) and low methanol 
crossover. One is the modifications on the 
perfluorosulfonic acid membranes such as 
blending Nafion with other polymers, 
compositing Nafion with inorganic nanoparticles 
or sputtering metallic blocking layers on Nafion 
surface [5–8]…etc. The second is to prepare a 
non-fluorinated membranes such as sulfonated 
poly(ether ether ketone), sulfonated polysulfon 
or polyphosphazene and so on [9–12]. The 
introduction of sulfonic acid groups into 
polymer backbone is usually by sulfonation on 
the base polymers. However, the disadvantage of 
this method is the sulfonationity is difficult to 
control. Another approach to get sulfonated 
polymers is through the polymerization directly 
from sulfonated monomers. This approach 
makes it easier to control the sulfonationity only 
by changing the mole ratio of the sulfonated 
monomers to non-sulfonated ones. 
Sulfonated polyimides (SPIs) with 
six-membered imide rings have been identified 
as one of the most promising membrane 
materials for PEMFC application due to their 
low methanol permeability, excellent thermal 
and mechanical stabilities, and good film 
forming ability [13–17]. Some of them have 
been claimed to display higher proton 
conductivity than perfluorinated materials. 
However, aromatic polyimides tend to hydrolyze 
under high moisture conditions and at high 
temperatures, which result in the degradation of 
the polymer main chain and a dramatic drop in 
mechanical strength. To achieve the high water 
stability, a variety of SPIs based on novel 
sulfonated diamines have been designed on the 
basis of knowledge acquired on the 
structure–property relationships. It was of 
interest to investigate the effect of highly 
flexibility on the sulfonated polyimied of the 
repeat unit, since one might expect enhanced 
proton conductivity, better hydrolytic 
stability[18~ 21] and, perhaps, modestly higher 
acidity due to strong electron-withdrawing by 
the sulfone group. 
In this study, a series of six-membered 
sulfonated poly(imide-siloxane)s were 
synthesized by altering the nonsulfonated 
diamine monomers having different bridging 
groups. These diamine monomers were selected 
on the basis of flexibility or angled of the 
bridging atom and their effect on properties were 
studied in detail. The effects of bridging groups 
on the SPI-SXx membranes properties 
(including proton conductivity, water uptake and 
dimensional change, and membrane 
morphologies) of the SPI-SXx membranes were 
evaluated through the study on their electrolytic 
properties. This will be instructional in designing 
better membranes for improved fuel cell 
performance.

(DDM; 97 ％ ) and α,ω-diaminopropyl 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Shin-Etsu 
Chemical Co., Ltd.) was used without further 
purification. 2,2’-Benzidinedisulfonic acid 
(BDSA; 70%, TCI) was dissolved in ethanol and 
was neutralized with triethylamine at 60 oC. 
BDSA was purified by recrystallization from the 
ethanol solution and was dried under vacuum for 
three days. m-Cresol were purchased from 
Riedel- de Haën®. m-Cresol and TEA were used 
without further purification. 
 
2.2. Synthesis of Sulfonated Poly(imide - 
siloxane) 
The synthesis of SPI-SX was performed by 
two-step method as shown in Scheme 1. Every 
SPI-SXx with different nonsulfonted diamine 
(ODA, DDM or m-PDA) was synthesized by 
changing the molar ratio of the diamines of 
ODA (or DDM or m-PDA), BDSA added. The 
SPI-SX membranes were the same of BDSA and 
PDMS content, but changing the nonsulfonated 
diamine by ODA, DDM or m-PDA (Table 1).   
For example, the synthesis of sulfonated 
poly(amic acid-siloxane) (SPAA-SXO) with 
molar ratio of 
NTDA:BDSA–Et3HN:ODA:PDMS = 1.05: 0.4: 
0.611: 0.039 was performed as follows. 
BDSA–Et3HN, ODA and 5 wt% of PDMS was 
dissolved in 6.66 g m-cresol into the 50 ml 
three-necked flask and stirred with magnetic 
stirrer under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, 4.0 
mmol of NTDA and 5.6 mmol of benzoic acid 
were added and the mixture was stirred at 
ambient temperature for a few minutes and then 
heated at 80 oC for 4 h and 180 oC for 20 h. 
After the reaction mixture was cooled to 80 oC, 
an additional 10 ml of m-cresol was added to 
dilute the highly viscous solution, and then the 
solution was poured into acetone. The fiber-like 
precipitate was filtered off, washed thoroughly 
with acetone, and dried in vacuum at 80 oC for 
15 h. The triethylammonium salt of sulfonated 
polyimides were dissolved in m-cresol, and the

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A series of SPI-SXs were prepared from 
NTDA, BDSA, and three unsulfonated 
diamines:ODA,DDM, and m-PDA. “One step” 
high temperature copolymerization was carried 
out in m-cresol in the presence of triethylamine 
and benzoic acid (scheme 1). PDMS, which has 
a flexible structure with a siloxane group, was 
used to provide flexible structur along the 
copolymer backbone. Therefore, the PDMS was 
introduced to enhance the proton conductivity 
and water uptake attributed from the highly 
flexibility of the siloxane segments. 
3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of 
SPI-SXx 
FT-IR was used to identify the molecular 
structure of the sulfonated copolymers and to 
estimate the structure of unsulfonated diamines. 
Figure 1 shows the FT-IR spectrum of the 
SPI-SXx copolymer. The characteristic 
absorption bond of the imide carbonyl groups at 
1710 cm-1 (symmetric stretching) and 1666 cm-1 
(asymmetric stretching) confirmed the formation 
of polyimides.  
Figure 1. The FT-IR spectra of SPI-SXx. 
The C-N-C absorption of the imide ring was 
observed around 1343 cm-1. The characteristic 
absorption bands at 1245 and 1196 cm-1 
correspond to aromatic sodium sulfonate 
symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations, 
respectively, which confirmed successfully 
introduction of sulfonated groups to the polymer 
chains. The C-H stretch of methyl group 
associated with PDMS was observed at 2923 
cm-1, and this absorption qualitatively confirms 
that siloxane segments were incorporated into 
the synthesized copolymers. The peak at 
1025-1096 cm-1 was assigned to Si-O-Si and 
Si-O stretch in the siloxane backbone. However, 
this signal overlaps with much weaker 
absorption from sulfonic acid groups appearing 
in the same region. The wide band at 704-881 
cm-1 is due to Si-C stretch. 
3.2. Properties of SPI-SX Membranes 
3.2.1. Thermal property 
Thermal stability of the SPI-SXs was 
investigated by TGA measurement. Fig. 2 shows 
the TGA curves of SPI-SXs Membranes. The 
SPI-SXs membranes are thermal stable within 
the temperature at around 300 oC. All the 
sulfonated polyimide films exhibited three-step 
degradation patterns. The initial weight loss 
around 100 oC was due to the evaporation of 
sorbed water in the sample. The second stage 
weight loss starting from 350 oC was attributed 
to the decomposition of the sulfonic acid groups. 
The variation in the structure of codiamine 
monomer affected the thermal stability of the 
polyimide. Polyimides based on DDM and 
m-PDA exhibited higher thermal stability than 
the other comonomers. The thermal stability was 
affected by both the rigid and the angled of 
bridging groups. Polyimides with ODA, which 
has ether groups, exhibited lower thermal 
stability than the DDM which contains methyl 
linkage. Polyimide with bulky ether groups 
exhibited lower thermal stability than the less 
bulky methyl and angled bridges. The TGA 
curve clearly indicates that this polyimide has 
fairly good thermal stability.

3.2.2. Water uptake and proton conductivity 
The water content in the sulfonated polymers 
is a very important factor that directly influences 
their mechanical properties and the transport of 
protons across membranes made of such 
polymers. Protons can be transported in 
hydrogen-bonded ionic channels, along with 
such cationic mixtures as H3O+, H5O2+ and 
H9O4+, in the water medium. [22, 23] In a fully 
hydrated state, sulfonated polymers may be

dissociated to produce immobile sulfonic acid groups and mobile protons in aqueous solution.  
The free protons thus formed move through a localized ionic network within fully water-swollen sulfonated polymer 
membranes. Accordingly, a suitable for water content should be maintained in sulfonated polymer membranes to ensure 
high proton conductivity. The amount of water taken up by the sulfonated polyimides depends strongly on the amount 
of sulfonic acid groups and is related to the IEC values. A higher IEC generally corresponds to higher water uptake. 
The IEC of the membranes was determined by titration and the values compared to theoretical values. These 
comparisons are reported in Table 2 and show good agreement (±10%) even for membranes possessing low IEC. This 
indicates that water is accessible to all sulfonic acid groups and that all protons should contribute to proton conduction. 
The proton conductivity of SPI-SX membranes is influenced by IEC, water uptake, flexibility of the polymer chain, and 
basicity of the sulfonted diamines. Sulfonated Poly(imide-siloxane)s with flexible structure and high basicity of the 
sulfonated diamine moieties tend to have good proton conductivity because the flexibility allows easy relaxation of 
polymer chain, as shown in Table 2. Accordingly, the IEC and water-uptake measurements were only performed on 
products that exhibit good proton conductivity. Products with PDMS feed composition greater than 5 wt % typically 
showed better proton conductivity compares in does not have the PDMS segments sulfonated polyimide (SPI). As 
expected, proton conductivity and water-uptake values both increase with PDMS content. In addition, The 
structure-property relationship of SPI-SX membranes is discussed in details according to the chemical structure of the 
various non-sulfonated diamines of SPI-SX membranes from the viewpoints of proton conductivity, ion exchange 
capacity (IEC) and membranes properties (water uptake, membrane swelling) at equal PSX content SPI-SXs. The 
conductivity of the SPI-SXm membrane is generally higher than that of the SPI-SXO and SPI-SXD membranes, 
because angled bridges increase membrane’s free volume corresponds to slightly higher water uptake than the other 
SPI-SX membranes.  
The conductivity of the SPI-SXO membrane is generally higher than that of the SPI-SXD membrane by about 6.2%. 
Water uptake data for the membranes are provided in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 3 to visualize the trend. This clearly 
indicates that ODA-based copolyimide membranes are much more conductivity than the corresponding DDM-based 
ones despite their similar IEC values, because the SPI-SXO content slightly higher water uptake than the other 
SPI-SXD membranes. Usually proton conductivity of membranes is strongly dependent on the water uptake which is 
mainly determined by the IEC. Membranes with lower water uptake should have badly proton conductivity. A 
comparison of the chemical structures revealed that these two kinds of copolyimides had quite different chain flexibility. 
DDM moiety is highly rigid because the two phenyl rings cannot rotate along the axis due to the steric effect of the 
polymer’s sulfonic groups. In contrast, ODA is fairly flexible due to the existence of a flexible linkage, ether bond, and 
therefore, the backbone of SPI-SXO should be much more flexible than that of SPI-SXD. A flexible chain can undergo 
relaxation more easily than the rigid one, and this is likely the main reason that SPI-SXO displayed much better proton 
conductivity than SPI-SXD. In addition, although all the copolyimide membranes had much larger IEC values than 
Nafion 117, their proton conductivities were roughly in the same level as that of Nafion 117. This is probably because 
Nafion had unique ion-rich channels (clusters) which were favorable for proton transport, whereas the present 
copolyimide membranes might have a rather homogeneous structure. 
Figure 3 shows the variation of proton conductivity of the copolyimide membranes at 100% relative humidity as a 
function of temperature. All the membranes displayed increased proton conductivities with increasing temperature, and 
m-PDA-based copolyimide membranes displayed high proton conductivities to the corresponding other membranes. In 
addition, SPI-SXO, SPI-SXm and SPI displayed similar proton conductivities than Nafion 117 at at about 80°C, 
whereas SPI-SX membranes showed fairly high proton conductivities, which were roughly comparable to that of 
Nafion 117.

humidity. 
3.2.3. Dimensional changes and activation energy 
The absorption of water necessitates an increase in volume of the membrane. Changes in the length and thickness of 
the membranes were measured and data listed in Table 2. Table 2 lists the ρ and water uptake values of the SPI-SX 
membranes equilibrated at 100% RH at room temperature (around 30 ◦C). The dimensions (thickness and diameter) of 
membranes were also measured at the same conditions. The dimensional change of SPI-SXD and SPI-SXm investigated 
were rather isotropic. As shown in Table 2, the SPI-SXO and SPI membranes displayed anisotropic dimensional change, 
which were different than of the SPI-SXD and SPI-SXm membranes. This may be attributed to the different 
water-swollen behavior of bridging group for these two kinds of SPI-SXx.  In the case of SPI-SXO and SPI, the 
soaking treatment also showed large dimensional change on the thickness. As a result, which has a flexible structure 
with ether groups of the SPI-SXO and SPI membranes lead to generally large dimensional change of the thickness. 
However, These SPI-SXD and SPI-SXm membranes showed clear anisotropic dimensional change with a slightly 
swelling degree in thickness and plane. The lower degree of anisotropic dimensional change in SPI-SXm may be due to 
the angled structures which promote entanglement of individual chains and restrict the remobilization of chains required 
for swelling. In SPI-SXD membranes, the chains are linear, rigid rods in nature, and thereby slightly swelling degree in 
thickness and plane.

Conclusion 
Sulfonated poly(imide-siloxane)s by varying the bridging groups in the nonsulfonated diamine monomer were 
synthesized and confirmed by the FTIR. The PDMS was introduced to enhance the proton conductivity and water 
uptake attributed from the highly flexibility of the siloxane segments. Furthermore, the structure of the bridging groups 
was systematically varied, for the first time to increase the free volume and it was found that the water uptake and 
proton conductivity increased with increase in free volume. The ether bond and angled non-sulfonated diamine 
monomers bridging group showed increased conductivity even at high temperature and also showed very high 
conductivity compared with Nafion117 under similar experimental conditions. They exhibited characteristic high 
thermal stability (>300oC) of SPI-SXx indicating its suitability for high-temperature operations. The presence of highly 
flexibility siloxane segments does significantly inhibit water uptake. The TEM experiments suggest that highly 
dispersal siloxane segments strongly influences membrances morphology and proton conductivity.
