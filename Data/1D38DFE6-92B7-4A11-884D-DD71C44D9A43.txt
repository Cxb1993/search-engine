Abstract 
Twelve young male participants were recruited to examine the effects of four exertion 
heights (48 cm, 84 cm, 120 cm, and 156 cm) and two hand exertions (one-handed and 
two-handed) on human maximum horizontal isometric pushing strength and foot 
placement while pushing. The results showed that participants preferred asymmetrical 
foot placements while exerting their maximum pushing strengths and the highest 
pushing strength was associated with the farthest trailing foot position to the vertical 
plane of pushing. People generally could push more strength and bear lesser strains on 
the load-bearing shoulder, arm and wrist while pushing with two hands than with one 
hand.

compared whether the manner in which participants executed a force on a load was 
affected between free and standardized foot placements. Outcomes suggested that 
participants chose reasonably similar characteristics in their base of support and there 
were no real differences in load kinematics between freely chosen and standardized 
foot placements when attempting a 20 % body mass submaximal isoinertial pulling.  
 
 
 
2. Method 
2.1 Participants 
A total of 12 healthy males participated in this study. Their mean (SD) age, body 
weight, and stature were 21.9(1.4) years, 63.7(7.6) kg, and 171.5(5.7) cm, respectively. 
They were right-handed and had some pushing experience.  
 
2.2 Apparatus and Experimental design  
A strength-testing fixture was constructed to adjust a load cell leveled at different 
exertion heights. A pair of height-adjustable support bars was used to support the 
exertion frame at the exertion height. A nonskid wooden floor was used to assure a 
sufficient high coefficient of friction between the floor and shoe soles. 
 
Participants’ maximum pushing strength was evaluated at four exertion heights 
(48 cm, 84 cm, 120 cm, and 156 cm, measuring from the floor), and two hand 
exertions (one-handed exertion and two-handed exertion). The dependent variables of 
this study were participants’ maximum pushing strength, leading foot position, trailing 
foot position and step length while pushing. The leading foot position and trailing foot 
position measured the horizontal distances from the toe of leading foot and heel of 
 6
length while pushing were measured for each test. Participants attempted three 
replications for each treatment.  
 
3. Results 
Strength measurements 
Table 1 lists the means, standard deviations for the maximum isometric pushing 
strengths. Table 1 shows the greatest pushing strength occurred at the exertion height 
of 84 cm. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the exertion height (F3,269 = 
429.2, p< 0.0001), exertion hand (F1,269 = 142.2, p< 0.0001) and their interaction 
(F3,269 = 26.9, p< 0.0001) all significantly affected human pushing strength. Figure 1 
demonstrates that two-handed pushing strength was greater than one-handed pushing 
strength across the four exertion heights, and the strength difference between 
two-handed pushing and one-handed pushing decreased with exertion height.  
 
Foot placement measurements 
Figure 2 shows the mean participants’ leading and trailing foot positions while 
pushing. Participants’ trailing foot reached to the farthest position when pushed at 84 
cm height. Additionally, statistical analysis indicated that hand exertion significantly 
affected participants’ trailing foot position (p < 0.05). The mean participants’ trailing 
foot position, averaged across the four exertion heights, for one-handed pushing were 
5.8 cm farther to the handle bar than those for two-handed pushing. Figure 3 shows 
the effects of exertion height and exertion hand on step length, revealing these effects 
were similar to those on trailing foot position. 
 
4. Discussion 
This study demonstrated that exertion height significantly affected human pushing 
 8
wrist for one-handed exertion were higher than those for two-handed exertion, this 
might possibly lead to an increased risk of injury due to inherent instability nature of 
the articulation of these joints (Fothergill et al. 1991). 
 
The participant’s foot placement while pushing is important for body stability and 
responsible for the magnitude of the strength produced. Allowing the participant the 
freedom to select an appropriate foot placement would facilitate the best-coordinated 
muscular synergism and obtain higher strengths (Daams 1993, MacKinnon 1998). 
Additionally, free foot placement is deemed as more realistic and task-related 
experimental protocols (Grieve and Pheasant 1981, Pheasant et al. 1982). Although 
any prescribed foot placement will be less than optimal for a given individual, 
MacKinnon (2002) suggested that this effect is of less concern for executing a 
submaximal, dynamic exertion than for an isometric exertion since an individual can 
choose different movement strategies to override the effects of less than desirable 
fixed foot placement.  
This study showed that participants tended to prefer asymmetrical foot placements 
while exerting their maximum pushing strengths with free foot placement. The 
advantages for adopting asymmetrical foot placement posture in pushing are twofold. 
First, asymmetrical foot placement allows a larger base of support and participants 
can regain balance more easily in the case of slip. Second, participants are allowed to 
fully utilize their trunk and lower extremities’ muscles in pushing. It is well 
recognized that participants’ trailing foot plays an important role on pushing strengths. 
Participants tried to lean forward more, pivoting about the trailing foot, while exerting 
their maximum pushing strength. Notably, exertion height greatly affects the degrees 
of freedom available for participants to place their optimal trailing foot position and 
thus base of support (step length) while pushing. Our results showed the effects of
