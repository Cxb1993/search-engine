method [8] can be activated by base 
treatment in aqueous medium. However, how 
the base treatment can influence the catalytic 
activity and how the treatment should be 
optimized were not discussed in the 
literatures. In this study, we prepared Al2O3- 
and TiO2-supported Au catalysts by an 
incipient wetness impregnation method and 
the effect of the following base treatment on 
the catalytic activity for CO oxidation was 
studied. How and why the base treatment 
may activate the prepared Au catalysts are 
discussed. This may provide insight to the 
active morphology of supported Au catalysts.

五、結果與討論 
    We reported earlier that the more 
effective procedure of the base treatment is to 
redisperse catalysts powders in basic 
acqueous solution. Three types of basic 
solutions were examined, namely, NH3(aq), 
NaOH(aq), and NaBH4(aq). Following the 
concept of pH adjustment, the pH of the base 
solutions before adding catalyst powders was 
maintained the same at 10. Figure 1 
compares the CO oxidation activity of the 
obtained as-is Au catalysts. The one treated 
by NaOH(aq) was the least active among the 
three catalysts. The pH of the aqueous 
solutions after catalyst treatment was 7.7, 5.5, 
and 10.2 respectively with NaOH(aq), NH3(aq) 
or NaBH4(aq). The molar ratio of [OH-]/ [Au] 
of the three base treatments was calculated as 
4.2, 0.3, and 130 respectively. 
 A second set of base treatment 
experiments was carried out at a constant 
[OH-]/[Au] of 4.5. All three solutions after 
catalyst treatment showed a pH of 7.7, 8.8, 
and 9.4 respectively. The CO oxidation 
activity of the obtained catalysts, as-is or 
after calcinations, was compared and shown 
in Figure 2. All three base solutions could 
activate the Au catalysts effectively. The 
catalyst treated by NaBH4(aq) show higher 
activity initially but the activity decreased 
after tests going up to 573 K and back down. 
The other two treated catalysts showed an 
opposite trend, i.e., lower activity initially 
and an increase in the activity after tests up to 
573 K and back. The calcined catalyst 
showed an improved activity which is stable 
during reaction tests from 323 to 573 and 
back to 273 K. Obviously, calcinations 
resulted in a stable active morphology and 
the increase in activity of the as-is 
NH3(aq)-treated catalyst during reaction tests  
can be attributed to in-line calcination by the 
oxygen during tests up to 573 K. 
Figure 3 shows the effect of OH-/Au ratio 
on the activity of the base-treated Au/Al2O3. 
All the catalysts were calcined at 573 K 
in-line before the test. It indicates that the CO 
oxidation activity, represented by T1/2 which 
is the reaction temperature achieving a CO 
conversion of 50 %, is the highest at an  
OH-/Au ratio of around 4. The trend is 
similar regardless of using NH3(aq), NaOH(aq), 
or NaBH4(aq) to treat the catalyst. All the base 
solutions after catalyst treatment were 
analyzed of the pH and the concentrations of 
Cl- and Au. Results shown in Table 1 indicate 
that at OH/Au > 3.5 (i) all solutions retained 
a pH higher than 8, (ii) all solutions 
contained negligible amount of Au, and (iii) 
almost all the Cl of the Au precursors were 
retained in the solutions. We demonstrated 
earlier that Cl presents mainly as Cl residue
