Introduction  
The lop ear deformity is a congenital malformation of the ear where the anti-helical fold 
is absent.  This is caused by a defect embryogenesis during the twelfth to sixteenth week 
of gestation, resulting in the ears protruding prominently.  Children with this deformity 
are often subjected to ridicule.  Currently, the deformity is treated using techniques that 
require incisions and sutures to recreate the natural anatomy of an anti-helical fold and 
balance the intrinsic forces within cartilage tissue that resist deformation. 
 
Laser-assisted reshaping of cartilage may be an alternative to these conventional 
techniques without the attendant morbidity of surgery.

  The main advantage of using a 
multimode optical fiber to illuminate and generate heat in cartilage is the ability to 
control the space-time temperature distribution and the time-dependent thermal 
denaturalization kinetics, resulting in reduced cellular injury that would be experienced 
by using other laser treatments such as laser illumination.
5
  Several studies have 
investigated laser-assisted reshaping of ear cartilage in porcine and rabbit ear.
6-10
  While 
successful reshaping has been demonstrated, nonspecific thermal injury to the superficial 
layers continues to be a problem.
11
  Moreover, the composite tissue of the ear is thin.  
This entails a broad penetration of laser energy deep into the tissue such that the 
superficial layers first penetrated by the laser are not the only layers affected.  Laser 
energy applied directly to a concave surface continues through the skin’s exterior, the 
cartilage in between, and finally through to the convex side of the specimen’s skin.   
 
Protection of both surfaces of skin is clinically important, however protection of the 
exterior skin surface is especially aesthetically important.  This study approaches this 
problem of superficial thermal injury by using a cryogen spray cooling (CSC) system.

Laser Systems  
Tissue specimens were illuminated with light from an Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1.064 µm, 
Sharplan lasers, Allendale, NJ).  The light was delivered by a 400 µm core diameter 
multimode optical fiber.  Spot size (~3mm) was estimated using burn paper (Zap-It, 
Kentek, Pittsfield, NH).  The fiber was secured to a vertically oriented caliper for 
increased accuracy and adjusted to a set-point of 0 mm).  The specimen was bent into a 
new shape (Fig. 2) using a vice that served as a jig.  The interior side of the specimen 
formed the inner portion of the bend and its exterior side formed the outer portion.  The 
distance between the two plates of the jig was 7 mm.  The fiber delivered laser energy to 
the composite cartilage grafts on the inner sides of the bend.  This method of bending 
the cartilage was selected, as it is analogous to creating the anti-helical curve in a human 
ear.  The concave side was illuminated at ten different sites with the centers of each 
laser spot separated from one another by 2 mm.  This resulted in an overlap of 
approximately 20%.  The center of the first spot was oriented 3.5 mm away from the 
upper edge of the specimen, which was also the case for the final spot with respect to the 
lower edge of the specimen.  
 
A broad range of laser parameters was systematically evaluated and a range of 
parameters that caused composite cartilage reshaping was determined.  Laser powers of 
10W, 20W, 30W, 40W, and 50W were selected for this project as they produced the most 
striking results exhibiting shape change in relation to thermal injury, relative to the use 
and absence of CSC.

to confirm the return to ambient temperature.  
 
Cartilage Reshaping 
Initially, tissue specimens assumed a flat shape with a deformation angle of 180°.  
These flat specimens were manually deformed by the jig where the grafts were 
essentially folded in a ―U‖ configuration with one half directly on top of the other half.  
This resulted in a deformation angle of 0°.  They were maintained in this shape during 
illumination.
20-23
  Following illumination, specimens were maintained in their 
deformations for only 15 minutes, at which time they were removed from the jig.  
Specimens were serially examined at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 14 days.  
Calculations of angle deformation observed among each specimen within every group 
were consolidated to form an average mean value to represent each illumination category.  
This mean value was configured by use of a Scale Graduated (cat# 187-201, Mitutoyo, 
Japan)  Deformation angle was defined as the angle between the two halves of the fold 
measured from a lateral point of view: 180° = flat, 0° = U-configuration in jig.  A 
smaller angle indicated more reshaping.  Then specimens were visually inspected and 
photographed to document shape change and acute thermal damage.  Specimens were 
kept in their isolated Petri dishes with saline dampened gauze strips and preserved at 4°C, 
to prevent decomposition of specimens, between recorded time slots.   Upon removal, 
each specimen underwent a series of recordings based on particular medical stain 
processes – Hematoxylin-Eosin stain, Safrain-O stain, and Acinic Blue stain in order to 
ensure the angulation of cartilage remained intact.

was to be administered for more dramatic and consistent reshaping.  Specimens that 
received 30W and above showed more dramatic deformation with limited skin 
destruction.  For those receiving 30W, an approximate 115° deformation was observed 
after 15 and 30 minutes.  After a 24-hour period, the reshaping was recorded at about 
130° after 14 days.  Specimens undergoing 40W showed a 98° reshaping after both 15 
and 30 minutes.  Following observation after 24 hours, those 40W-specimens displayed 
a 100° reshaping and remained approximately the same at 105° after 14 days.  Optimal 
reshaping that occurred and prolonged throughout the 14-day experimental observation 
period was obtained by the 50W-specimens.  A calculated 90.10 ± 2.05° and 91.50 ± 
2.51° deformation was observed after 15 and 30 minutes, and with a minimal retraction 
of 99.70 ± 1.89° after 24 hours and 14 days, making a final recording of 100.30 ± 2.78° 
deformation obtained by the 50W-specimens (Fig. 3).  Deformation figures and 
calculations were recorded and provided in Table 1. 
 
Thermal Injury  
Thermal injury was evaluated by inspection of the tissue noting color change, epithelial 
slough, and frank carbonization—all recorded with a digital camera.  Texture was 
evaluated qualitatively by touch.  In general, obvious thermal injury was not observed 
for specimens illuminated with CSC.  Control group specimens treated without CSC 
were the most damaged.  Nearly all specimens that solely received laser treatment 
displayed thermal damage.  Carbonization in the line of illumination was noted in all 
specimens.  At the time of the study, texture was rough and dry with a central 
depression center.

the antihelix, our study was attuned to achieving those results with the 50W-test group.
24
  
Best results were obtained and shown in specimens receiving 50W with controlled CSC, 
where 100° reshaping was achieved and recorded after 14 days.  With these results, a 
non-invasive method of cartilage reshaping was achieved, along with minimal observed 
thermal damage.  Depending on the subject, in regards to thermal damage as a result of 
laser application, recovery can occur in vivo over a period of time—naturally in 
accordance to the type of treatment.  The minimal thermal damage observed in this 
study is believed by the study’s conductors to surpass over time.  As opposed to 
conventional surgical reshaping methods that are known to leave scarring and/or 
permanent treatment markings, controlled CSC for laser treatment can be administered 
for reshaping composite tissues/cartilage.  Nonetheless, the study holds the recorded 
degrees of reshaping two weeks after procedures and further study on the prolonging of 
cartilage reshaping should follow.   
 
Most cutaneous CSC laser treatments are performed with the objective of generating heat 
below the specimen surface, with the superficial layers maintained at a safe temperature 
by the CSC delivery.  Usually for these cutaneous applications, both laser and CSC are 
delivered to the same surface of the target tissue.
16,25-31
  The study at hand used a novel 
approach in that CSC was applied to cool the graft on both sides of the specimens to 
where laser energy was to be delivered.  In this arrangement, excess damage due to 
overheating was avoided in the superficial tissues on both concave and convex surfaces 
of the specimens.  CSC application to both the convex and concave surfaces of the 
specimens allowed the laser illumination to more effectively heat and reshape the 
cartilage since it escaped the over-cooling interference of CSC delivery.  Graft viability

similar cases.  Observation was made during experimentation that the thermocouple 
would measure the temperature of actual laser beam at times.  Placement of the 
thermocouple on both concave and convex surfaces of specimens corresponding to the 
site of illumination theoretically places the wires only directly in the laser line of fire.  
Although the temperature tended to agree with the results of the study, they could 
theoretically have been due to the direct heat of the laser energy alone, not the heating of 
the actual tissue.  The structure of a thermopile could eliminate this problem as the use 
of a series of connected thermocouples would fully log the temperature of entire surface 
of specimen.  A thermopile is highly recommended for future study and experimentation.  
Future studies include histology of ex vivo specimens under various laser and CSC 
parameters.  At different wattage of laser application, specimens treated with different 
modes of CSC will be compared.  One anticipated observation is that high laser power 
creates a drastic decrease in tissue viability. 
 
Conclusion 
This project aimed to explore combinations of laser and CSC parameters that were 
unlikely to cause permanent injury in an ex vivo model while still being effective and 
practical for the reshaping of cartilage.  Direct high-power laser illumination of cartilage 
with CSC delivery to both sides of the superficial surfaces allowed rapid heating while 
minimizing injurious temperature elevations on both sides of the superficial epidermis.  
Specimens that underwent 50W with controlled CSC were found to produce significant 
reshaping with a minimal amount of superficial thermal injury.  As ex vivo specimens 
were administered under the experiment’s storage environment of 4°C, future in vivo 
subjects to undergo like procedures will be treated and protected under those regulations

angle that measured 90° after the initial elapsed time slot of 15 minutes.  
Further, at same wattage after 30 minutes post-illumination, the deformation 
angle remained at 90°.  After 24 hours, a small deformation angle of 
approximately 100° was measured.  Deformation angle was maintained at 
about 100° and nonetheless produced a favorable angle, as with other 
specimens of this group, that closely measured to that calculation throughout
