ABSTRACT 
An experiment is carried out in the present study to investigate the vortex flow 
patterns resulting from a round air jet impinging over a large confined heated 
horizontal circular disk. In the present experiment the jet flow rate is varied from 1.5 
to 6.0 (standard liter per minute) for the jet Reynolds number ranging from 101 to 406 
with the injection pipe diameter Dj = 20.0 mm and jet-disk separation distance H = 
25.0 mm. The temperature difference between the disk and the air injected at the inlet 
of the jet is varied from 0 to 5.0℃ for the Rayleigh number Ra ranging from 0 to 
7,340. 
 
The results from the flow visualization indicate that the vortex flow is 
characterized by the primary and/or secondary inertia-driven circular rolls along with 
several buoyancy-driven rolls. The number of the buoyancy rolls induced depends on 
the buoyancy-to-inertia ratio, which can vary from 1 to 5. Besides, at a low Gr/Rej2 
slightly deformed circular buoyancy rolls prevail in the test section. For slightly 
higher Gr/Rej2 the flow is dominated by the highly deformed curved rolls. The roll 
pattern becomes some what irregular for a further increase in Gr/Rej2 . For all cases 
examined here the vortex flow is unsteady and irregular to a certain degree since the 
buoyancy effect is rather strong for the large impinging plate tested here. In addition 
to the roll deformation, the merging and splitting of the buoyancy rolls occur 
nonperiodically in time. This unsteady and irregular vortex flow is also reflected in 
the data for the air temperature variations with time. 
 
     Some quantitative buoyancy-driven vortex flow characteristics such as the size 
and location of the buoyancy rolls are summarized and correlated empirically. Besides,

relevant to the vortex flow and heat transfer in the jet impinging onto a heated plate is 
reviewed briefly in the following. 
Considerable research has been carried out in the past to study the fluid flow and 
heat transfer in the round or slot jet impinging vertically downwards onto a large 
horizontal plate without confinement. Most of the studies focus on quantifying the highly 
efficient heat transfer associated with the high speed impinging jets. For example, heat or 
mass transfer in the impinging jets with side wall investigated by Hrycak[3] used the air 
as the work fluid and Dp/D = 16 , here Dp is the plate diameter and D is the nozzle 
diameter. Jambunathan et al.[4] and San and Shiao[5] also used air as the work fluid and 
L/D = 5.5~166.7 , W/D = 4.17~41.7 , here L is the plate length and W is plate width. 
They found that there is a maximum Nusselt number and they focused on effects of the 
jet size and plate spacing on the stagnation region. Similar investigations on the cooling 
efficiency of the impinging jets were carried out by Chou and Hung [5]. They used air as 
the work fluid with L/W = 20. Chung and Luo [6] used the same work fluid with L/D = 
4~10. Chou and Hung [5] found the correlations for Nusselt number and if the velocity 
distribution is parabolic , there is a maximum Nusselt number in stagnation region .  
Moreover, Sahoo and Sharif[7] and Gao and Ewing [8] investigated confined air jet 
respectively with L/W = 20 and L/D = 14.4~28.8. The numerical modeling of slot-jet 
impingement cooling of a constant heat flux surface confined by a parallel wall 
conducted by Sahoo and sharif [7] found that when the jet Reynolds number increased , 
the center of the primary and secondary inertia-driven rolls moved outward and when the  
buoyancy-inertia ratio increased , the strength and length of the secondary vortex 
decreases. While the investigation of the effects of the confinement on the heat transfer to 
round impinging jets exiting a long pipe examined by Gao and Ewing [8] found that the  
heat transfer resulting from the confined jet is smaller than that from the unconfined jet 
and when the jet Reynolds number increased , the location of the secondary maximum 
heat transfer moved outward.  
The flow field in the confined impinging jets with the presence of a side wall was 
investigated by Fitzgerald and Garimella[9] with L/D = 110~55 and W/D = 15~55. 
Besides, a study of the flow field of a confined and submerged round impinging jet of 
FC-77 was conducted by Morris and Garimella[10] for Dp/D = 15, here Dp is the diameter

1.3 objective of present study 
The above literature review clearly reveals that in a gas jet impinging onto a large 
heated disk the inertia and buoyancy driven vortex rolls aside from the circular rolls may 
be induced. But the patterns of these new vortex flows and the associated thermal 
characteristics remain largely explored. Experiment will be conducted in the present 
study to examine the possible presence of the inertia and buoyancy driven new vortex 
rolls in an air jet impinging onto a large heated disk with an upper parallel plate 
confinement and attention will be focused on delineating the conditions leading to the 
appearance of these rolls and the detailed flow characteristics of these rolls.

wood planes and one black sheet of lint to reduce the effects of the disturbances from 
discharging the flow to the ambient surrounding. 
(2) Heating unit 
The heating unit is designed to maintain the lower circular disk at the preset 
uniform temperature during the experiment. It is composed of a 15-mm thick high 
purity copper plate of 16-inch in diameter, acting as the impinging disk, which is 
directly placed on the heating elements. The edge of the heated disk is connected with 
a concentric insulated portion with an outer diameter about 25 inches. After the jet 
impinges the heated disk, it moves in the radial direction over the heated plate and the 
insulated portion. Then the air is discharged into the ambient. Besides, the heating 
unit consists of a resistance heating element, a holder and an insulator. The holder 
which is made of stainless steel can support the resistance heating element and the 
heated copper disk. The heater attached onto the back side of the copper plate is 
divided into 4 concentric zones (Fig. 2.3). Each zone is independently heated by a 
power supply with the D.C. current passing through the nickel coil placed on the 
stainless steel holder and its resistance is about 166 ohm. The entire heating unit is 
then placed on a Teflon plate. Additionally, to reduce the heat loss from the sidewall 
of the copper plate and Teflon plate, the lateral surface of the entire heating unit is 
wrapped with a 20.0-mm thick thermal insulation layer of superlon. A proper control 
of the voltage from each power supply allows us to maintain the copper plate at a 
nearly uniform temperature. Moreover, the copper plate temperature is measured by 
several corrected and calibrated T-type thermocouples at selected detection points 
located at 1-mm below the upper surface of the copper plate, which are fixed the 
detection points through the small holes drilled from the backside of the plate (Fig. 
2.4).

video camera DCR-PC330. The recorded images are later examined carefully in a 
personal computer.  
(5) Temperature measurement  
To understand thermal characteristics of the steady and unsteady vortex flows, 
the temperature of the air flow in the processing chamber is measured by inserting a 
thermocouple probe into the test section through twenty-four holes of 1-mm in 
diameter opened at the selected locations on the top of the chamber. In the experiment, 
the thermocouple tip is positioned at selected vertical distances from the upper surface 
of the disk. More specifically, the thermocouple probe is an OMEGA (model HYPO) 
mini hypodermic extremely small T-type thermocouple implanted in a 1-inch long 
stainless steel hypodermic needle.  
 
2.3 Experimental procedures 
For each case the experiment starts with the air at the room temperature Ta 
compressed first into the high pressure tank and the smoke generator through the 
connection pipe, and then injected into the test section. The air moves first over the 
disk and finally leaves the test section. In the meantime the temperature of disk and 
the air flow rate are controlled at the preset levels. As the air flow in the test section 
reaches steady or statistically stable state, we begin to visualize and record the vortex 
flow pattern in the space between the horizontal disks.

4.1 Vortex Flow Patterns  
 
At first the vortex flow pattern observed for the limiting ease of the unheated 
lower copper disk with ∆T= 0°C( Ra= 0) for the jet flow rate Qj varied from 1.5 to 6 
slpm ( Rej= 101 to 406 ) at long time when the flow already reaches steady state is 
illustrated in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2. The results indicate that there are two circular rolls in 
the test section. The mechanisms through with these two rolls are formed are 
examined. Specifically, upon impinging the heated plate the jet is deflected to move 
radially outward along the desk and slows down significantly due to the radial spread 
of the wall-jet flow. The wall-jet flow travels a certain distance from the stagnation 
point and then moves obliquely upwards as a result of the jet momentum is unable to 
overcome the wall friction and the retarding effects of the entrained flow by the upper  
confined plate. Then, the oblique flow is divided into two streams as it encounters the 
confined plate. One stream moves radial inward toward the low pressure region 
created by the viscous shearing of the surrounding fluid associated with the jet 
injection, forming the inner roll which is therefore considered as the primary 
inertia-driven roll. Another stream moves outward along the upper plate for a certain 
distance until it is unable overcome the wall friction of confined plate. Then it 
descends gradually and flows outward. The phenomenon is often seen at low flow rate.  
But at a high flow rate, a smaller second roll is induced near the primary 
inertia-driven roll which is found to be driven by the viscous shearing effects 
produced by the stronger and larger primary inertia-driven roll, which is termed as the 
secondary inertia-driven roll and has the opposite rotating direction with the primary 
inertia-driven roll. Besides, at decreasing flow rate both primary and secondary 
inertia-driven rolls become weaker and smaller. 
 
22 
 
buoyancy rolls are very weak. At slightly higher Gr/ Rej2 deformed circular rolls 
along with regular inertia roll prevail such as that given in Fig. 4.8 (d) ＆ (e), 4.9 (d) 
＆ (e), 4.10 (d) ＆ (e). For a further increase in Gr/ Rej2 the buoyancy rolls become 
highly deformed especially these near the exit of the test section ( Fig. 4.8(b) ＆ (c), 
4.9 (c), 4.10(c) ). For an even higher Gr/ Rej2 the buoyancy-driven vortex flow 
consists of irregular circular rolls, as is clear in Fig. 4.8(a), 4.9(b), 4.10(b). The inertia 
roll also deforms. At a still higher Gr/ Rej2 the vortex rolls become highly irregular ( 
Fig. .4.9(b), 4.10(a), 4.11(a) ＆ (b), and 4.12(a) ＆ (b) ). 
 
 
 
4.2 Effects of Jet Reynolds Number 
 
     The effects of the jet Reynolds number on the vortex flow patterns can 
also be revealed from the results in Fig. 4.1-4.12. For a given ∆T the strength and 
number of the buoyancy-driven rolls increases significantly at decreasing jet Reynolds 
number, obviously due to the increase in the buoyancy-to-inertia ratio. However, the 
inertia-driven rolls weaken at decreasing Rej, apparently owing to the reducing jet 
inertia. At the lowest Rej of 101 tested here the most inner buoyancy roll may contact 
with the primary inertia-driven roll for a high ∆T (Figs. 4.6 ＆ 4.7 ). Thus the 
interaction between the inertia- and buoyancy-driven vortex flows is stronger. Besides, 
at lower Rej the most outer buoyancy roll is much larger and stronger than the other 
buoyancy rolls. 
 
 
 
24 
 
20s. Later, the buoyancy rolls in the right half of the test section experience similar 
changes. The resulting vortex flow pattern is highly asymmetrical. 
     For a raise of ∆T to 2 °C the flow photos shown in Fig. 4.20 manifest that aside 
from the merge and split of the buoyancy rolls cyclic radial expansion and contraction 
of the buoyancy rolls are seen. Besides, the evolution of the vortex flow pattern is 
slightly quicker. Moreover, the radial extent of the primary inertia-driven roll varies 
noticeably with time. Furthermore, the degree of the roll asymmetry is more severe. 
This trend continues for a further increase of ∆T to 3°C, 4°C, and 5°C, as evident 
from the results shown in Fig. 4.21-4.23. 
 
 
 
4.5  Quantitative Characteristics of Buoyancy-Driven Rolls 
     In the impinging jet flow over a large heated plate investigated in the present 
study, the buoyancy-driven vortex flow is rather complicate. Here we summarize 
some important quantitative characteristics of the long time buoyancy-driven vortex 
flow in Table 4.1 deduced from the flow photos. These include the total number of the 
buoyancy rolls induced NBR and the radial position of center of the most inner 
buoyancy roll ZBR. Besides, SBR1 denotes the maximum radial extent of the first 
buoyancy roll. Similar symbols are used for the other buoyancy rolls. 
     The data given in Table 4.1 are correlated empirically as follows. For the first 
buoyancy roll the radial location of the center of the roll can be correlated as  
ZBR1/H= 
-23.529+7.372*(Gr/Rej2)-63.07*(Gr/Rej2)2+174.401*(Gr/Rej2)3-187.769*(Gr/Rej2)4 
+69.217*(Gr/Rej2)5+275.262/(NBR)-932.121/(NBR)21327.756/(NBR)3-647.541/(NBR)4

for 101≤ Rej ≥ 406 and 1468≤ Ra ≥ 7,340                               (4.8) 
when compared with the present measured data, the standard deviations of the above 
five correlations are 3.4%, 13.5%, 15.2%, 14.5%, and 1.2%, individually. 
 
 
 
4.6 Thermal Characteristics 
The time records of the non-dimensional air temperature at selected locations 
are presented in Fig.4.24-4.28 for various Rej and Ra. The results indicate that for the 
air jet impinging onto the large heated plate the air temperature is in unstable 
oscillation since the resulting vortex flow is unable even at low buoyancy-to-inertia 
ratio. In fact, nonperidic flow oscillation prevails for all cases with a high frequency 
oscillation superimposed on a low frequency oscillation. 
 
 
 
4.7 Flow Regime Map 
Based on the results obtained in the present study, a flow regime map for the 
cases with H = 25 mm delineating three different buoyancy-driven vortex flow 
patterns in the mixed convection confined impinging jet is shown in Fig. 4.29. The 
results in this plot manifest that at certain buoyancy-to-inertia ratio Gr/Rej2 the flow 
pattern changes from the irregular to incompleted vortex rolls and the decreasing  
Gr/Rej2 the flow pattern changes from the incomplete to regular vortex rolls. 
 
     First, the boundary separating the irregular and incomplete vortex rolls can be 
correlated as
