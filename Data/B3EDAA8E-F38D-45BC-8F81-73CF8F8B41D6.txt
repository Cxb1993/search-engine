Due to the therapeutic effectiveness, the new area CAM (complementary and 
alternative medicine) has drawn the attention of researchers and medical professionals in 
the past decades. Researches in biomedical engineering and life sciences should lay more 
stress on promoting the human health, in both the physiological and mental aspects. As a 
matter of fact, scientists of the West have been reporting substantial findings of the 
effectiveness of meditation practice in CAM not only on improving the physiological and 
mental health but on treating a number of diseases. Accordingly, the investigator has been 
devoted to the study of Zen-Buddhist meditation for the past years. We investigate, from the 
viewpoint of biomedical engineering, phenomena of the human life system under the 
orthodox Zen meditation practice. We study the time-varying characteristics and dynamic 
mechanism during meditation course in order to further establish the correlation among 
different electrophysiological signals and parameters. 
At the end of the twentieth century, life science and clinical medicine have begun 
striding into the new, insubstantial realm of research --- bioenergetic medicine. It states that 
all the living beings and the minerals consist of energy expressed in the form of various 
frequencies, called the information field. Our body is the simultaneous, integrating function 
of numerous information fields. The acknowledgement of information field involved in 
everything in the universe makes scientists in the pioneering research begin steering a new 
study on Intrinsic Data Field (IDF). According to the theory of IDF analysis, diseases may 
be re-defined as the weakness or deficiency of certain IDF frequency. We can accordingly 
quantitatively study the characteristics of spirituality, creativity, mood, stress, stress-counter 
ability, organ functions, etc. based on concept of IDF. 
In the scope of IDF study, bio-acoustic vocal profiling is one of the pioneering 
methods recently emerging in the field of CAM. Quantitative features of voice signals are 
investigated for the physiological and psychological conditions. In this study, we developed 
a scheme to remove the background noise and segment words of a sentence. Besides, we 
estimated three parameters including the main frequency (F0), power and the interval 
between two adjacent words. These parameters were then used to evaluate the effects of 
Zen meditation. Nine meditators (experimental group) and nine non-meditators subjects 
(control group) were involved in this experiment. We recorded their voices before and after 
the thirty-minute meditation/resting sitting. To justify this novel approach for prognosis, we 
also compared the results with those of HRV (heart rate variability) analysis based on ECG 
(electrocardiograph). Our preliminary results showed that, in the experimental group, the 
voice power increased and the main frequency F0 decreased after meditation, while the 
control group exhibited no significant difference. High efficiency of relaxation during 
meditation is assumed to cause the differentiation between groups.

Voice produces the waveform pattern (to be called voice print) containing a great deal of frequency 
information that appears to relate to the physical and emotional health and balance of the speaker. Since 
every person's voice is unique, the resulting frequency map may show indications of physical and/or 
emotional issues for the particular person at the recording time. 
In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of voice prints of subjects under stress test, which were 
then compared to the established database containing frequency assignments of vitamins, minerals, amino 
acids, bones, muscles and all manner of substances, including drugs and toxins. 
The study on voice/bio-sound diagnostics began no earlier than 20 years ago. Sharry K. Edwards 
(Edwards 2005) proposed that bio-sound diagnostics was aimed to explore the correlation between 
frequencies of voice print and physiological/psychological factors and, accordingly, establish a model 
characterizing the normal, healthy states of body and mind. We then may make diagnoses and even 
prognoses of human mind-body diseases. Tanja Bänziger and Klaus R. Scherer (Bänziger and Scherer 
2005) utilized F0 of voice print to resolve various emotional states. Jiménez and others (Jiménez et al., 
1997) analyzed the characteristics of voice prints of Parkinson’s patients. 
Although the study on bio-sound diagnostics is still in its infancy, the merits of easy implementation 
and non-invasive measurement make it a potentially favorite approach to be further investigated in the 
biomedical engineering field. Our research group has been investigating the effects of Zen meditation, 
based on conventional medical instrumentation, on human life system since 1998 and the results have 
been reported and published in a number of literatures. At current stage, we make a further stride to 
explore the possibility of modeling the meditation body-and-mind behaviors by other biomedical 
parameters. Accordingly, the experimental subjects were Zen-meditation practitioners, while the control 
subjects were healthy, normal non-practitioners within the same age range as the experimental group.

speech recognition systems are mostly based on HMMs (Hidden Markov Models). In this study, our 
speech signal was represented by the HMM recognition framework. In HMM, The content of speech is a 
series of states. For example, the term “??”(Shou3 Gi4) consists of two words, and each word contains 
a ‘consonant’ and a ‘vowel’. In this term, the consonants and the vowels (?, ?, ?, ?) string four 
states, and we label them as S1, S2, S3 and S4.  
In each state, we could observe one set of parameters, that were denoted by a vector. The vectors 
representing the same state may not always be the same. For example, the vector representing the vowel 
‘?’ may vary slightly when it appears at different moments. Therefore, statistical model based on 
probability distribution is often employed in the quantitative analysis of the vector set corresponding to 
the same state.  
During a section of speech, we observe a series of vectors representing the states. However, the 
transition between states is generally unknown. That is, the probability of the transition is ‘hidden’ and 
depends on what the last state is. The term ‘hidden Markov model’ originated from this phenomenon. 
Therefore, the speech process conforms to the hidden Markov model. In this study, estimation of the 
fundamental frequency F0 was based on the model application. 
 
2. State-temporal space and the optional path 
Consider N states in the sample space and T temporal units in the time scale. We then obtain a feature 
characterized by an N-by-T square in the state-temporal space. In the square, there exist NT paths from 
which we may find the potential result. The speech process is not reversible in the space, which means the 
state transferring from left to right can not reverse. We applied Viterbi algorithm to find out the optional 
path corresponding to the most potential path in the whole process.  
Define the probability variable ( )itγ  as 
 ( ) ( )λγ ,OsqPi itt == . (1.1) 
Accordingly, ( )itγ  represents, under a set of known outcomes observed, the probability of state is  
occurred at time t. The probability can be calculated as follows,

II.2  Three voice parameters 
1. Fundamental frequency F0 
When the vocal chords vibrates, the frequency of air decides the pitch we perceive. The perceived 
frequency is called the fundamental frequency (F0). Fundamental frequency relates to gender, the vowel 
we speak, the strength applied to the vocal chords, and so on. One may send out different F0 in different 
physiological or psychological statuses. In this study, we assume meditation may take effects on the 
subjects that can be observed from the variation of F0. 
Due to the quasi-periodic characteristic of voice print, the F0 component can be estimated based on 
auto-correlation approach. The auto-correlation function reaches the largest value at the delay of one pitch 
period. The formula to compute the auto-correlation function is

The Effects of Zen-Buddhist Meditation on Heart Rate Variability 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The heart rate variability (HRV) during various meditation techniques has been explored. However, in 
most of these techniques the slow breathing (<0.15Hz) is the major feature (Lehrer et al. 1999; Peng et 
al. 1999&2004). It has been known that respiration play an important role in adjusting HRV. Naturally, 
the HRV characters observed in these studies were hardly due to the slow breathing. This study explored 
the heart rate variability during Zen-Buddhist Meditation. For this technique, there is no request to the 
breathing rate. The meditators only to have their breathing smooth and the major thing they have to do is 
focusing on a specific Chakra. 
II. METHODS 
Subjects 
Two groups of subjects were recruited in this study. The experimental group consists of 9 subjects (6 
males and 3 females, mean age 27.8 years with S.D. 2.6 years). They have been practicing Zen-Buddhist 
meditation for an average of 6.7 years. The control group consists of 9 subjects (8 males and 1 female, 
mean age 25.3 years with S. D. 3.3 years). All subjects were free from cardiac, pulmonary, and other 
chronic diseases and their voice is normal. Also, none of them had the habits of smoking and having 
caffeine-containing drinks. 
 
Procedure 
For control group, the subjects rested (sat in a ~70? head-up tilt position with eyes closed) on a chair 
for 30 minutes. For experimental group, the subjects meditated (sat in a upright position with eyes closed) 
for 30 minutes. The subjects of experimental group were free to take either full-lotus or half-lotus posture 
which they were used to in usual. During meditation, what the experimental group subjects did was to 
concentrate their mind on the “Zen Chakra”, an energy point inside the third ventricle of human brain. All 
subjects breathed spontaneously. Because the human cardiac function can be regulated by autonomic 
nervous system (ANS), the experiments were conducted during the same period (3:30pm to 5:00pm) to 
ensure the approximately same state of ANS of all subjects.

Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses were carried out using Microsoft Excel. For each subject, variable values in the 
middle (10-20 minutes) of meditation/rest were averaged. Then the mean values of HRV variables and 
respiration rate were carried out for each subject. To examine the HRV difference between rest and 
meditation, the Student’s t test was used. The significant levels were set at p<0.05. 
 
III.  RESULTS 
The results of HRV analysis of control group during rest, experimental group during rest, and 
experimental group during meditation were illustrated in Figure 1 and numbered in Table 2.

addressed on the underlying mechanisms. The search for physical and psychological correlates of meditation has 
centered essentially on three methods: Yoga in India, Transcendental Meditation (TM) in the United States, and Zen 
Buddhism in Japan. Note that the Zen Buddhism in Japan (Kasamatsu 1966) was promulgated from mainland 
China where the orthodox Zen Buddhism originated. We briefly narrate the promulgating history of Zen Buddhism 
below. 
Buddha Shakyamuni??????? attained the Buddhahood and discovered the eternal truth of the universe 
in meditation under a linden tree. The eternal truth comprehends the light of the supreme wisdom, the noumenal 
energy, and the natural powers of the true self. The orthodox Zen Buddhism originated in the affair that Buddha 
Shakyamuni transmitted this light of wisdom to the Great Kashiyapa???????? some 2,500 years ago. The 
same path towards Buddhahood was promulgated to mainland China in 527 by Bodhidharma??????, the 28th 
patriarch. The current patriarch is Zen master Wu Chueh Miao Tien (or simply “Miao Tien” ??????), the 
85th patriarch of the orthodox Zen-Buddhism Sect since the Great Kashiyapa. In the promulgating history of 
orthodox Zen-Buddhism, very few disciples were able to catch the quintessence since it cannot be taught in any 
form of lectures. Written material and spoken words cannot pass on the true message of Zen. Although there are a 
few sects imparted from the Zen Buddhism, they cannot be the true Zen without succession to the supreme wisdom 
and the noumenal energy. The core essence is Zen-Buddhist practice rather than Sutra-texts studying. The current 
Zen master Wu Chueh Miao Tien established the Taiwan Zen-Buddhist Association to preach the orthodox 
Zen-Buddhism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic and wide-scale study on the meditation 
EEG of Zen-Buddhist practitioners in Taiwan. It was hoped that this study would provide some basis for further 
research into the benefits of Zen meditation.
