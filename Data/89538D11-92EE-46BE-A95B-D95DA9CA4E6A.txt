accident are obviously serious for the former. Due to safety considerations, most 
planning and constructing plants have been chosen for the latter. Until now, it has 
gained much attention for the alkylation reaction. To obtain higher operating 
efficiency and reduction of sulfuric acid consumption, feedstocks of different reactors 
have been in separate streams according to olefin gradients and acid strength of 
sulfuric acid [1, 2]. Those major operating parameters make obvious difference 
between each reactor, e.g. isobutane/olefin ratio and reaction temperature, owing to 
existence of chemical reactivity between olefins and sulfuric acid [3]. Several 
investigators tried to increase the interface between the sulfuric acid and 
hydrocarbons by impregnating the former solution over solid support to obtain higher 
selectivity of trimethylpentane [4, 5]. In another way, some additives have been 
developed to enhance solubility of hydrocarbons in sulfuric acid solution. Many oil 
companies made research in patents and applied industrially. For example, Cities 
Service Oil Co. proposed dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid and p-phenylenediamine, 
respectively [6], Texaco Co. found N,N',N"-tris(n-alkyl)phosphoric triamide [7] and 
sulfoamide [8], trifluoromethane sulfonic acid being also suggested as additive [9]. In 
our previous patents, N,N'-dimethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine and naphthalenesulfonic 
acid have been proved to be better additives [10, 11]. 
According to the study of Albright and coworkers [12, 13], the compositions of 
heavy end of alkylate and the selectivity of trimethylpentane are under the influence 
of olefins in feedstocks. The sulfuric acid/olefins volume ratio is responsible for the 
product distribution of the intermediate. Nonetheless, higher concentration of olefins 
induces to polymerization reaction which leads to production of heavy end. 
Furthermore, the alkylation process must be operated in low temperature (5℃10 ) ℃
to prevent its side reaction e.g. polymerization, disporprotination and cracking from 
happening. Another report has been issued in the past on the use of propylene, butene 
and pentene respectively as feedstocks [14], and for which a detailed investigation of 
the consumption of sulfuric acid and the yield pattern of alkylate have been made. 
Traditionally, the spent sulfuric acid consisting of excess of water and organic 
compounds would be disposed by sequential steps, including purification and 
concentration procedures [15]. For the former, the oxidative destruction of organics in 
spent acid was chiefly conducted by oxidants, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, ozone and 
potassium permanganate. For the latter, the contaminant-free sulfuric acid was 
concentrated by multiple vacuum evaporators under subatmospheric pressure [16]. 
Industrially, the spent acid was treated by an incineration method, which converted 
sulfuric acid and organic compounds into sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and steam. 
The 96 wt% concentration of sulfuric acid was achieved by absorption of sulfur 
trioxide resulted from oxidation of sulfur dioxide into dilute solution of sulfuric acid

throughout the testing. For the duration, the spent acid was periodically sampled from 
the reactor and undergone TOC and Karl-Fischer analyses to evaluate the residual 
organic compounds content and water amount, respectively. 
To investigate the effect of electrode potential on the destruction of organic 
compounds, three tests with various electrode potentials (3 up to 5V) were carried out. 
In addition, for the sake of elucidating the influence of dosage of oxygen on the 
removal of organic compounds, a series of tests with various flow rates of oxygen 
(100 up to 150 mL min-1) were undertaken. The electrochemical oxidation tests were 
also performed in the sulfuric acid concentrations of 80, 87 and 93 wt%, respectively 
to find out the optimal conditions for mineralization of organic compounds. 
Furthermore, the oxygen-free electrolysis was conducted to make clear the oxidant 
responsible for the oxidative degradation of organic compounds. 
2.2. Total organic compounds analysis (TOC) 
The spent acid which underwent electrolysis was analyzed utilizing a Tekmar 
Dohrmann Phoenix 8000 instrument fitted with an UV reactor and a nondispersive 
infrared (NDIR) detector. The organic compounds existent were oxidized to carbon 
dioxide by sodium persulfate with assistance of UV irradiation, which was 
subsequently quantified by the NDIR detector. On the contrary, the inorganic 
compounds, which had been acidified by phosphoric acid, would be eliminated in the 
form of carbonic acid. Prior to analyses, the concentration of organic compounds in 
samples was diluted to one fortieth to meet the measuring ranges (20-500 mg L-1), 
which had been calibrated by the potassium hydrogen phthalate standard solution. 
2.3. Karl-Fischer analysis 
The water contents of spent acid after various intervals of electrolysis were 
determined by a Karl Fischer Coulometric Moisture Titrator (MKC-510N Model), in 
which iodine acts as a titrant. In the course of analyses, the weight of samples was 
maintained below 0.5 mg to prevent the interference of sulfuric acid. 
2.4. Hydrogen peroxide concentration analysis  
The concentration of electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide was measured by the 
titanic sulfate method wherein the light absorbance of titanic-hydrogen peroxide 
colored complex was detected by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 850 model, 
Perkin Elmer) at a wavelength of 410 nm [19]. Prior to analyses, the samples were 
diluted to one fortieth to meet the measuring limit requirement. The data obtained 
were corrected by the standard solutions of hydrogen peroxide ranging between 0 and 
200 mg L-1.

conducted. It truly indicates that the TOC removal efficiency without dosage of any 
oxygen gas is slightly lower than those with a variety of dosages of oxygen. Owing to 
poor efficiencies in anodic oxidation of organic compounds by platinum electrode 
[22], the anodic oxidation mechanism is ruled out in this study. Consequently, the 
plausible interpretation is that at the anode water was oxidized to release oxygen, 
which was sequentially reduced to hydrogen peroxide at the cathode, in coincidence 
with the issues by several researchers [25]. Moreover, the hydrogen peroxide 
produced solely from electrolytic oxidation of water accompanied with oxygen 
reduction plays a major role for mineralization of TOC in spent acid. 
Another evidence is given on the contents of electrogenerated hydrogen 
peroxide in sulfuric acid (93 wt%) during the electrolytic testing in the absence of 
organic compounds. As shown in Fig. 5, the hydrogen peroxide concentration 
accumulated increases with electrolytic time at the oxygen flow rate of 120 mL min-1. 
Likewise, a similar increasing trend of the hydrogen peroxide concentration was 
observed in the case of absence of oxygen. The result supports previous hypothesis 
that electrochemical oxidation of organic compounds relies mainly upon the hydrogen 
peroxide produced at the cathode. Besides, it reveals that some of electrogenerated 
hydrogen peroxide comes from electrolytic oxidation of water. 
The water contents of spent acid treated are summarized in Table 1. It appears 
that water contents were gradually diminished. That may be ascribed to the oxidation 
of water to oxygen gas at the anode (see Equation 2). Likewise, a similar increasing 
trend of the sulfuric acid concentration during the electrolytic tests was observed. It 
may be also attributed to the loss of water molecules in spent acid by electrolytic 
oxidation. Consequently, the result supports above hypothesis that electrogenerated 
hydrogen peroxide lies partially in electrolytic oxidation of water into oxygen gas at 
the platinum anode.  
3.4. Effect of sulfuric acid concentration on electrolysis 
To elucidate the important role associated with sulfuric acid, experiments for 
electrolytic destruction of TOC at different sulfuric acid concentrations were carried 
out (shown in Fig. 6). Apparently, the TOC removal efficiency at the sulfuric acid 
concentration of 80 wt% is higher than that of 87 wt%. An identical trend was 
obtained as compared the data of sulfuric acid concentration of 87 wt% with that of 93 
wt%. The observation may be interpreted with the Equation 1, which was preferred to 
occur at high concentrations of proton and resulted in generation of large amounts of 
hydrogen peroxide. Upon consideration of solubility of oxygen in spent acid, there is 
a sligt difference among sulfuric acid concentrations investigated in this study [26]. 
Nevertheless, at the sulfuric acid concentration ( 80 wt%), water molecules are lean 
to dissociate sulfuric acid molecules. Therefore, a larger amount of proton is produced
