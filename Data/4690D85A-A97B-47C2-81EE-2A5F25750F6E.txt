Abstract 
The chloride migration test applied with electrical field has been widely used in recent 
year to evaluate the chloride permeability of concrete. However, the heavy amount of samples 
and chloride analysis are considered as time-consuming and expensive. This article presents two 
simplified test procedures for measuring the steady state chloride migration coefficient and the 
non-steady state chloride migration coefficient in cement-based materials using the accelerated 
chloride migration test (ACMT). Sixteen mixes of concrete were used and tested at three curing 
ages in this study to study the steady-state chloride migration coefficient. The initial electrical 
current and chloride-time curve in steady state period is measured during the test. The union 
fixed time of steady state is obtained from the maximum of start time and the minimum of end 
time in steady state period for all test specimens following the measurement of initial electrical 
current. According to the measurement of initial electrical current and the union fixed time of 
steady state, it provides a rapid way to estimate the steady state chloride migration coefficient 
based on the chloride migration rate by using Nernst Planck’s equation. In second approach, 
four mixes of mortar were used to evaluate the non-steady state chloride penetration profile with 
five different accelerated migration times and five applied potentials using ACMT. The test 
result shows that a linear correlation exists between the total amount of chloride and total charge 
passed. The total amount of diffusing chloride in specimen is obtained from the measurement of 
total charge passed. The predicted chloride penetration profile can be obtained rapidly from the 
measurement of total charge passed and surface chloride content. The non-steady state chloride 
migration coefficient is determined based on the chloride penetration profile and chloride 
penetration depth by using modified Fick’s second law. 
Keywords: chloride migration rate, initial current, total amount of chloride, chloride penetration  
profile.

answer: 
※ how to make concretes that are immune to these interlopers (ionic species), (durability). 
※ how to calculate how long our structures will last (service life prediction), 
※ how to determine the service-life in the field at early age so that we may accept or reject 
structures (testing).〞   
The durability of concrete mainly depended on the chloride ions because these ions can 
penetrate concrete from the environment surrounding the structure. Once the chloride ions have 
reached the reinforcement bars, they may initiate corrosion and induce the degradation of the 
concrete structure. This may lead to early repair or rehabilitation of the structure. The cost 
needed to rehabilitate deteriorated concrete structures is tremendous [2]. Therefore, the mention 
by Bickly [1], which to determine the concrete diffusivity of concrete at early age is an 
important work to the concrete durability. In order to assess chloride diffusivity of concrete, a 
test method is needed to develop to determine the chloride diffusion coefficient in a reasonable 
time. 
 In the past, the conventional diffusion test method was often to evaluate the chloride 
diffusion characteristics of cement-based materials by measuring the steady state chloride flow 
across the specimen, and the chloride diffusion coefficient can be calculated based on the Fick’s 
first law [3]. However, the conventional diffusion method requires a long time (several months 
or years) to obtain the chloride flux in steady-state, which was considered time-consuming and 
laborious. The conventional test is not suitable for concrete testing at early age or when the 
rapid results are needed. The immersion test methods such as 90-day salt ponding test [4] and 
Nordtest (NT Build 443 [5]), are also used to assess the ability of resistance of chloride 
penetration into concrete by diffusion mechanism. Instead of measuring the chloride flux in 
steady state of the conventional diffusion test, the non-steady state chloride profile in concrete is 
  4
penetration profile in concrete was used to determine the chloride diffusion coefficient by using 
modified Fick’s second law. Meck and Sirivivatnanon [13] set up the correlation of chloride 
penetration depth obtained from the colourimetric method and total charge passed of RCPT. 
Another studies used the electrical migration method to calculate the chloride diffusion 
coefficients by using the change of chloride concentration in the downstream cell [14-24]. 
According to the measurement of the chloride-time curve in downstream cell, the 
non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient can be determined based on the measurement of 
the breakthrough time for chloride ions penetrating through specimen by using modified Fick’s 
second law, and the steady state chloride migration coefficient can be calculated by using the 
Nernst Planck’s equation. Yang et al. [24] indicated that a linear relationship between the 
non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient obtained from ACMT method and the chloride 
diffusion coefficient obtained from 90-day salt ponding test. Yang and Cho [22] pointed out that 
a correlation between the chloride migration rate and the electrical current measured at a given 
charge passed in steady state. 
1.2 Objective of investigation 
 The accelerated chloride ion diffusion test, in which an external electrical field is applied 
to accelerate the movement of the chloride ions in concrete specimen, has shorten the 
experimental time of the conventional long-term diffusion test and rapid results can be obtained. 
However, the accelerated chloride migration test requires monitor and take liquid samples 
frequency for the chloride concentration analyses or the profile grinding technique needs special 
equipment, so that the chloride diffusion coefficient might be obtained. The procedure of 
migration test is considered laborious and expensive. The main objective of this thesis is 
therefore for the purpose to decrease the frequency of sampling and analyzing of chloride ions 
during the test and avoid the complicated acid-soluble test procedure for the chloride content of

LITERATURE REVIEW  
2.1 Mechanism of chloride ion transport in concrete 
 The penetration of chloride ions through concrete is one of the factors which induce the 
rebar corrosion and may shorten the service life of structure. Therefore, chloride penetration 
into concrete is one of the most decisive processes for durability. The time for these ions 
penetrated into concrete and reached rebar depend first on mechanism of ion transport and 
secondly, on the external concentration of the chloride ions and microstructure of the concrete 
[11]. The phenomena involved in the transport of chloride ion into concrete are very 
complicated and still not fully understood. Chloride ions, present in sea water, marine 
environment, and de-icing salts for instance, penetrate into concrete following three main 
different mechanisms [2, 25]:  
1. diffusion  
2. absorption 
3. forced convection 
The most familiar method for chloride penetration into concrete is diffusion. For this to 
occur, the concrete must have a continuous liquid phase and a chloride concentration gradient 
must be existed. Another common transport method is absorption. As the concrete surface 
exposed to the wetting and drying cycle environment, the water or moisture (possibly 
containing chloride ions) encounter with the dry surface of concrete, the chloride ions will be 
drawn into the pore structure through capillary suction. The mechanism of absorption is driven 
by moisture gradients. However, the depth of drying is small, and the absorption will not bring

solved applying the following boundary condition 0)0,0( CC tx =>= (the surface concentration is 
constant at 0C ), the initial condition 0)0,0( ==> txC (the initial concentration in the concrete is 
0), and the infinite point condition 0)0,( =>∞= txC (far enough away from the surface, the 
concentration will always be 0). The solution is [2]:

where ),( txC  is the concentration of ion species at position x  and time t , 0C  is the 
source concentration of ion species, erf  is the error function. Concrete is a porous matrix that 
included both solid and liquid components. The rate of ion diffusion in the solid portion of the 
concrete matrix is negligible compared to the ion diffusion in pore structure. The diffusion 
coefficient is controlled by the physical characteristics of the capillary pore structure. Therefore, 
the rate of diffusion is called here effective diffusion coefficient ( effD ). However, the natural 
chloride diffusion test is considered that it is time-consuming and takes weeks to obtain the 
chloride diffusion coefficient. The disadvantage of natural chloride diffusion test is improved by 
applying an electrical field to accelerate the rate of penetration of chloride ions.   
2.3 Ion transport in concrete under an electrical field 
 In order to accelerate the transport of chloride ions, the migration tests have been 
developed in last decades. The principle of the migration tests is to apply an electrical field 
  10
Not only chloride ions move toward anodic electrode, but also the ions in concrete or 
electrolyte solution take part in migration. According to the definition of the transference 
number ( it ) of an ion moving under the action of an external electrical field, the transference 
number ( it ) is defined by the proportion of the current carried by this ion in relation to the 
current carried by the rest of the ions. It is formulated as [11]: 
∑== λ
λ
zc
cz
I
I
t jjjji             (2-4) 
where jI  is the electrical current of the ion specie j , I  is total electrical current, jz  is ion 
valence of specie ion specie j , jc  is concentration of ion specie j , jλ  is the molecular 
conductivity of ion specie j . The transference number is a function of the ionic mobility or the 
equivalent conductivity. It means that higher molecular conductivity of ion specie will carry 
much more proportion current than lower one. Therefore, the measurement of the total electrical 
current is contributed by all of the ion movements.     
 The migration test which applied an electrical field is very quick when compared with the 
tests based on pure diffusion test. Table 2.1 shows that the ion mobility in aqueous solution at 
298 K [26]. The mobility of chloride ion is 8109.7 −× )/(2 sVm × . If an electrical field of 1 
V/cm is applied to chloride ions, the average speed is equal to 8 sm /μ . Although the speed of 
chloride ion movement might seem slow, however, if it is expressed in atomic scale, it means 
that one chloride ion is passing about 10,000 molecules of water per second. Therefore, the 
migration test is a rapid way to determine the ion diffusion coefficient by applied an electrical 
field. 
 
 
  12
the rate of diffusion is controlled not only by the ion diffusion through the pore solution but by 
the physical characteristic of the pore structure. The rate of chloride ions ingress into concrete 
depended mainly on the pore structure of the concrete, which is affected by the factors including 
materials, construction practices, and curing age. The factors will be influenced by: 
1. water-cement ratio 
2. supplementary cementitious materials 
3. curing age (degree of hydration) 
4. curing temperature 
5. chloride binding capacity of concrete 
The water-cement ratio determines the porosity of the harden cement paste at any age of 
hydration. If the water-cement ratio of the mix less than 0.38 by mass, complete hydration is not 
possible as the volume available is insufficient to accommodate all the products of hydration. 
However, if the water-cement ratio is higher than about 0.38 by mass, all the cement will be 
hydrated and the volume of the gel is not sufficient to fill all the space available to it so that 
come capillary pores will be present after the hydration process has been completed [27]. As 
hydration proceeds, the capillary network becomes increasingly tortuous as interconnected 
pores are blocked by the formation of C-S-H. When hydration complete in a mature cement 
paste, the water does not easily move through the small gel pores and the permeability 
controlled by the interconnected network of capillary pore. Mehta [28] indicated that in 
well-hydrated, low water-cement ratio pastes, the capillary pores mat range from 10 to 50 nm, 
however, in high water-cement ratio pastes, at early ages of hydration, the capillary pores may 
be as large as 3 to 5 μm. The water permeability and ionic diffusion may rise by the 
water-cement ratio [29]. The diffusing paths of chloride ion into concrete have three paths: the 
  14
diffusing ability and may restrict the movement of chloride ions. 
4. Fly ash and blast furnace slag have more C3A which can adsorb more chloride ions to form 
Friedel's salt (C3A．CaCl2．10H2O). 
Another influence on the pore structure of concrete is the degree of hydration on the 
concrete. The more mature concrete, the great amount of hydration will be occurred and the 
more highly developed will be the pore structure. This is especially for the concrete containing 
the slower reacting supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and ground granulated 
blast furnace slag that require a longer time to hydrate [32]. Thomas [33] also indicated that the 
incorporation of fly ash and slag have little impact on chloride transport properties at early age 
(e.g. 28 days), however, it have magnitude improvement on chloride transport properties in the 
long term.  
 The rate of chloride penetration into concrete is also affected by the chloride binding 
capacity of concrete. A portion of the chloride ions in pore solution reacts with the concrete 
matrix becoming the either chemical or physical bound, and these binding reduce the rate of 
chloride diffusion. If the diffusion coefficient is measured in non-steady state, not all of the 
binding have been occurred, therefore, the binding will affect the measurement of diffusion 
coefficient. However, in steady state condition, all the binding can be presumed and this effect 
will not be observed [2]. The chloride binding capacity is controlled by the cementing materials 
used in the concrete, also by the C3A content of the cement. The increased C3A content of the 
cement leading to increased chloride binding [34, 35] so that reducing the rate of diffusion. 
2.5 Existing experimental test methods 
In last decades, many various experimental test methods have been developed to 
understand the chloride transport properties in saturated concrete, and to evaluate the chloride 
  16
 
Fig. 2.3—Evolution of the chloride concentration in the downstream cell with time 
The constant of chloride flux measured in steady state can be used to calculate the steady 
state chloride diffusion coefficient by using the Fick’s first law: 
L
c
DJ upclcl =              (2-6) 
where clJ  is the steady state chloride flux (mol/m2/s), clD  is the chloride diffusion 
coefficient (m2/s), upc  is the upstream chloride concentration (mol/m3), and the L  is the 
thickness of test specimen (m). The duration of conventional diffusion test depends mainly not 
only on the thickness of specimen but also on the characteristic of concrete (w/c ratio, degree of 
hydration, supplementary cementitious materials,..). Conventional diffusion test was considered 
very well the real process of diffusion and the experiment equipment is easy to perform and not 
expensive.  However, the conventional diffusion test method requires several months or years 
to obtain the steady-state chloride flow across the specimen. Therefore, the conventional 
diffusion test method was a long term diffusion test and very time consuming for testing.

 Another common used of the immersion test method is in accordance with NT Build 443 
(Nordtest) [5]. The performance of bulk diffusion test is similar to the salt ponding test as can be 
seen in Fig. 2.5. The difference in test procedure from the salt ponding test is the initial moisture 
condition of specimen. The test specimen is saturated with limewater to prevent any initial 
sorption effect when the chloride solution is introduced. Instead of the coating on the side of 
specimen and leaving one face exposed to air, the only face left un-coating is the one exposed to 
NaCl solution. The test method of NT Build 443 prescribes the test duration of 35 days with a 
2.8 M NaCl solution.  
 
Fig. 2.5—NTBuild 443 Nordtest set-up 
At the end of exposure, the chloride penetration profile in concrete as can be seen in Fig. 
2-6 is determined by collecting powder samples at different depths, and the acid-soluble 
chloride content of each sample is determined in accordance with AASHTO T260 [38]. From 
the chloride penetration profile, the chloride diffusion coefficient can be calculated according to 
the Fick’s second law as:

ponding test and Nordtest) are still long-term tests. The minimum exposure period is 35 days for 
low quality concrete, however for higher quality concrete, there has been difficulty in 
developing a sufficient chloride profile. In order to develop a sufficient chloride may penetrate 
into concrete for a meaningful chloride profile, the test duration must be extended to 90 days or 
longer for chloride diffusion into concrete to allow the evaluation of higher quality concretes. 
Both of the process of conventional diffusion test and immersion test are very slow, these test 
methods are unsuitable for concrete testing at early age or when rapid results are needed.   
2.5.3 Migration test methods 
 In order to accelerate the chloride ions transport in concrete, the migration test methods 
have been developed to evaluate the ability of resistance of concrete specimen against chloride 
ions ingress into concrete. The principle of the migration test methods are applying an electrical 
field across to the saturated concrete specimen by means of electrodes placed on both side of the 
specimen. Under the influence of electrical field, the charged species such as chloride ion, 
hydroxide ion, and calcium ion are forced to move toward the electrode of opposite sign. 
2.5.3.1 ASTM C1202 Rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) 
 The Rapid Chloride Permeability Test (RCPT) (ASTM C1202-00 [39]), which was 
developed by Whiting [6], is the first test proposed for rapid qualitative assessment of chloride 
permeability of concrete by measurement of the total charge passed. The rapid chloride 
permeability test has been largely used in recent years to evaluate the quality of concrete. The 
performance of the RCPT as can be seen in Fig. 2.7, a 100 mm diameter and 50 mm thick 
saturated concrete specimen was placed between two compartments, each compartment with 
250 ml solution volume. One of reservoir was filled with 3.0 % NaCl solution and in the other 
reservoir was a 0.3 N NaOH solution. A 60 volt of DC voltage is applied across the concrete 
  22
electrical conductivity measured at the beginning of the test. Wee et al. [7] indicated that the 
charge passed through concrete (RCPT) was well correlated with the chloride penetration data 
generated through the 90-day soaking test. The RCPT method seems a convenient and rapid 
way to estimate the chloride penetrability of cement-based materials. However, some criticisms 
of RCPT have been summarized by many researchers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] as below: 
1. The amount of the charge passed depends on all of the ion species in pore solution not only 
on the chloride ions. 
2. The high voltage applied leads to an increase in temperature and flow speed. 
3. The measurements are made before steady-state migration is achieved. 
4. The charge transfer is mainly due to the hydroxide ions in pore solution not to the chloride 
ions. The concentration of hydroxide ion affects the pore solution pH and the RCPT result.  
5. The RCPT result (total charge passed) only can be used for ranking concretes penetrability 
(Table 2-2), however, it is possible to introduce the total charge passed in a predictive model 
for service life on structure.  
Table 2.2 RCPT ratings of chloride ion penetrability of concrete

2,000~4,000 Moderate 
1,000~2,000 Low 
100~1,000 Very low 
<100 Negligible 
 
As mention previously, the total electrical current is contributed by all of ion species in pore 
solution movements, the measurement of the total current passing across the cell is a function of 
the amount and type of ions, but not only of the chloride flux or chloride mobility [11]. it affect 
  24
nitrate solution to detect the depth of chloride penetration into concrete, colx , with the 
colorimetric method. The colorimetric method technique was developed by Collepardi et al [49], 
the silver nitrate solution have a chemical reaction with the concrete containing the chloride ions 
to product a visible whitish substance silver chloride. In the absence of chloride ions in concrete, 
the silver instead bonds with hydroxide ions present in the concrete, inducing a brownish 
substance.

condition:

Fig. 2.9—Accelerated Chloride Migration Test (ACMT) set-up  
A saturated concrete specimen is placed between two compartments. The concrete 
specimen can be of any size, but it usually a disk of 100 mm in diameter and 15 to 50 mm in 
length. The thickness of specimen will affect the duration of test, but a sufficient size is required 
to avoid aggregate interface influences. If the size of aggregate is comparable to the thickness of 
specimen, a weak interface transition zone (ITZ) exists between the aggregate and matrix and 
provides a faster path to the movement of chloride ions. In order to avoid the effect of ITZ, the 
thickness of concrete specimen must be about 3 times large than the maximum aggregate size [2, 
19]. The cathodic compartment was filled with 4500 ml sodium chloride solution and the anodic 
compartment was filled with sodium hydroxide solution, which each solution volume is 4500 
ml. Increase the volume of solution is one of reason for reducing the Joule effect [11], 
furthermore to provide sufficiently amount chloride ions to penetrate through the specimen from 
cathode cell. An electrical potential is applied across the concrete specimen by means of a DC 
power supply connected to the brass electrodes on each side of specimen. The electrical fields 
used for ACMT method was suggested in the range of 3 V/m to 10 V/m [2]. Work done by Yang 
et al. [16, 17, 18, 20] utilized the electrical field of 8 V/m for accelerating chloride migration in 
concrete, which is sufficient to accelerate significantly to movement of chloride and not high

used as the average chloride front reached the edge of the specimen in side of downstream [15, 
24, 52, 53, 54]. Tong and Gjorv [15] found a correlation between the initial electrical 
conductivity and the chloride diffusivity in non-steady state. Yang et al. [24] in their research 
works found that a linear relationship between the non-steady-state chloride migration 
coefficient obtained from ACMT method and the chloride diffusion coefficient obtained from 
90-day salt ponding test, and the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient is about 4 times 
large than the chloride diffusion coefficient. The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient 
obtained on the basis of chloride concentration is linearly related to the non-steady-state 
chloride migration coefficient obtained from electrical current [54].  
The ACMT method provided can be used to predict the long-term chloride diffusivity of 
concrete. However, not only the duration of the test is still significant for rapid investigation (10 
days to a month), but also the experiments are exhausting and expensive (frequent of sampling 
and analyzing of chloride concentration by titration).

Following the specification of ASTM C1202-97 [39], slice specimen was water-saturated 
under vacuum. Before the vacuum water-saturated, the slides or specimens were air dry for 1 
hour, and then the lateral surface of the specimens was coated with epoxy. After coating 
hardened, the specimens were then placed in a vacuum desiccative chamber containing a 
pressure less than 1 mmHg for 3 hours. The vacuum apparatus is shown in Fig. 3.2. The 
specimens were then immersed into de-aerated water at the same vacuum pressure level as 
before for one more hour. After then, the specimens were taken out from the chamber and kept 
in de-aerated water for at least 18 hours before the ACMT set-up.

Fig. 3.3—Test set-up of ACMT 
A schematic diagram of the ACMT set-up is illustrated in Fig. 3.3. The specimen was placed 
between two acrylic cells. The anodic cell was filled with 4.5 liter of 0.3 mole/L NaOH solution 
(anodic solution) and the cathodic cell with 4.5 liter of 0.52 mole/L (3 %) NaCl solution 
(cathodic solution). Two mesh electrodes (10 cm diameter, #20 mesh brass screen) were placed 
on two sides of the specimen in such a way that the electrical field is applied primarily across 
the test specimen. The cells were connected to a power source. The cathode is connected to the 
negative pole and the anode is connected to the positive pole of the power supply. The electrical 
current was measured and recorded at 5 minute intervals using a data logger. The ACMT 
apparatus is shown in Fig. 3.4. 
In this investigation, two experimental procedures were carried out for chloride analysis. 
One of the procedures is measure the quantity of chloride ions passing through the specimen in 
anode cell and determined periodically using potentiometric titration with 0.01N silver nitrate 
(AgNO3) solution. The apparatus of potentiometric titration titrator (Metrohm 702 SM) used in 
this study was designed by Metrohm company, as shown in Fig. 3.5. The steady-state chloride 
migration coefficient and non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient of concrete were 
determined on basis of chloride migration rate and breakthrough time respectively from the

The other experimental procedure is measure the chloride penetration profile of mortar 
specimen (Group B) in non-steady-state. Five different accelerated migration times less than the 
breakthrough time ( bt ) of each mixes on a potential difference of 24 volt and five different 
applied electrical potentials (18V, 24V, 30V, 36V, and 42V) less than 42 volt were used in this 
study. After completion of the migration test of ACMT, the specimen was taken out from the 
acrylic cells and allowed to dry. In order to avoid the adhesion of salt crystal on the exposed 
chloride surface, the surface of each specimen was wire brushed until all salt crystal buildup 
completely removed. Figure 3.6 shows that three cuboid specimens (2cm×2cm×5cm) were 
obtained by cutting from the ACMT specimen (Ø100 x 50 mm), and each cuboid specimen was 
dry cut from the exposed to chloride surface for every 5-mm. The slice specimen were then 
dried at 105 oC to constant mass and grounded to pass through a 300-μ m sieve.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this investigation, the electrochemical technique is applied to accelerate chloride-ion 
migration in cement-based materials to estimate the chloride permeability of concrete in a 
reasonable time span. This study presents two simplified test procedures for measuring the 
steady-state chloride migration coefficient and the non-steady-state chloride migration 
coefficient in cement-based materials using the accelerated chloride migration test (ACMT). 
4.1 Chloride Migration in ACMT 
The liquid samples were carried out frequently from anode cell during the accelerated 
chloride migration test (ACMT). The chloride concentration was determined from the solution 
in the anode cell by the average of the test results of three liquid samples. The typical result of 
chloride concentration is plotted in Fig. 4.1 as a function of time. Figure 4.1 shows that four 
stages exist, non-steady state, transition period, steady state, and attenuate with respect to the 
change of the chloride concentration. 
1. Non-steady state: The chloride ions were in the process of migrating through the saturated 
pores in concrete and have not yet reached the anode cell. 
2. Transition period: The movement of chloride ions in concrete reached the edge of the 
specimen in side of anode cell, and the breakthrough of chloride ions were cumulated in 
anode cell. The chloride-time curve measured in anode cell is non-linear due to an uneven 
distribution of the chloride content in the concrete specimen. 
3. Steady state: The flux of chloride ions passing through the specimen becomes constant. 
  44
chloride-time curve in Fig. 4.1, the start time AT  and the end time BT  was obtained 
corresponding to the start point A and end point B of steady state. The start time AT , the end 
time BT , and the duration of steady state BAT  ( BAT = −BT AT ) for all mixes tested at three 
curing ages are listed in Table 4.1. The start time AT  and end time BT  of steady state of all 
test specimens vary from 21 h to 333 h and 80 h to 637 h, respectively. The start time AT  and 
the end time BT  decrease with the increase of w/b ratio, and the start time AT  and the end 
time BT  show significant increase for concrete containing mineral admixtures. The duration of 
steady state ( BAT ) in Table 4.1 ranges between 55 h and 315 h for all mixes, it indicates that the 
constant of chloride flux exist in chloride-time curve at least about 2 days long in ACMT for all 
mixes tested at three curing ages. The duration of steady state is so long that the chloride flux 
can be easy obtained as the test procedure of liquid sampling at 8 h intervals from anode cell. As 
can be seen in Table 4.1, the duration of steady state ( BAT ) decrease with the increase of w/b 
ratio except the mixes of S35 at 56 days curing age, and SF45 at 91 days curing age.

1. Only what happens inside the concrete specimen is influencing the measurements. 
2. The term dealing with convection in Eq. (4-2) can be neglected. 
3. The diffusion component of Eq. (4-2) is considered negligible in comparison to that due to 
migration. 
4. The concrete specimen is thin enough to allow reaching a steady state condition in few 
hours. 
5. The chloride concentration in one chamber of the cell is much higher than in the other. This 
allows accept that the concentration of chlorides in one side of the cell remains 
comparatively constant. 
The first term and third term in Eq. (4-2) are the contribution of diffusion and convection. 
Hence they can be neglected in the migration test. As a result, the only second term in Eq. (4-2) 
is of parameter importance in the electrochemical process. Following the assumptions are

4.2.2 Chloride migration rate from start point and end point of steady state 
 In this study, the ACMT method was used to estimate the steady state chloride migration 
coefficient by using applied electrical potential. The ACMT method provides a shorter test 
period to obtain the steady state chloride migration rate than a conventional diffusion test 
method. However, the typical result of chloride-time curve as can be seen in Fig. 4.1 shows that 
the ACMT test procedure needs to take out the liquid sample from anode cell many times 
duration the test for the purpose of monitor the evolution of chloride concentration, the test 
procedure was considered laborious, expensive, and un-convenient. In order to decrease the 
frequency of sampling and analyzing the chloride ions during the ACMT, a simplified test 
procedure is developed in this study to obtain the steady state chloride migration rate.  
 The chloride concentrations AC  and BC  corresponding to the start time of steady state 
AT  and the end time of steady state BT  are shown in Fig. 4.1 and the test results of chloride 
concentrations AC  and BC  for all mixes test tested at three curing ages were listed in Table 
4.4. The mention previous that the slope of chloride-time curve in steady state is constant, 
therefore, the steady state chloride migration rate ABK  obtained from the start point A and the 
end point B of steady state portion as shown in Fig. 4.1 can be calculated as:

maximum of start time of steady state ( AT ) and the minimum of end time of steady state ( BT ) 
for all mixes. The union fixed time of steady state contained the steady state period of all mixes 
is from initial time ( iT ) of 55 h to terminal time ( fT ) of 80 h as can be seen in Fig. 4.18. The 
mention previous that the slope of chloride-time curve in steady state is constant, therefore,  
the steady state chloride migration rate can be determined rapidly from the measurements of 
chloride concentration in anode cell at the initial time iT  and terminal time fT  by using Eq. 
(4-5). Identification of the union fixed time of steady state of all mixes provides a simple 
sampling procedure to obtain the steady state chloride migration rate.   
In this study, the sixteen concrete mixes were tested at three different curing ages. 
However, a union fixed time of steady state of all mixes test at three different curing ages can 
not be determined from the 48 data bases used in this study. The concrete properties such as the 
chloride flux, the start time of steady state, the end time of steady state, and duration of steady 
state depend on the concrete characteristics, such as type of binder, mix proportion, and length 
of cure. In some cases, for example on the variation of chloride concentration as a function of 
time in steady state of SF series concrete tested at 28 days curing age was shown in Fig. 4.19. 
As can be seen in Fig. 4.19, the steady state period of SF35, SF45, SF55, and SF65 are from 180 
h to 396 h, 104 h to 346 h, 79 h to 205h, and 38 h to 121 h, respectively. The maximum of start 
time of steady state ( AT ) in Fig. 4.19 is 180 h, and the minimum of end time of steady state 
( BT ) in Fig 4.19 is 121 h. The initial time ( iT ) of 180 h is large than the terminal time ( fT ) of 
121h in this case, unfortunately, the empty set of the union fixed time is observed in the case of 
SF series concrete tested at 28 days curing age.

4.2.4 Initial electrical current and duration of steady state 
 The electrical current across the cells was recorded with a data logger during the 
experiment in this study. The test results of electrical current during ACMT for all mixed test at 
three curing ages were shown in Fig. 4.20 to Fig. 4.31 as function of time. The Fig. 4.20 to Fig. 
4.31 show that the electrical current decreases with the decreased w/b ratio or the concrete 
containing mineral admixtures. The measurements of initial electrical current ( iI ) at the 
beginning of the ACMT for each test specimen are presented in Table 4.6.

procedure. The value of the steady state chloride migration rate ifK  is very close to the ClK . 
  
Fig. 4.41—Correlation between the steady state chloride migration rate ifK  and ClK  
The 16 mixtures with different w/b ratio (0.35, 0.45, 0.55, and 0.65), mineral admixtures (C, 
F, S, SF series concrete), and different curing age (28, 56, and 91 days) were used in this study, 
to develop the rapid method based on the measurement of initial current and sampling time 
region. However, the previous study data [57] also can be satisfied to the rapid method as can be 
seen in Fig. 4.41. It means that it is not necessary to monitor the chloride concentration in anode 
cell during ACMT. The steady state chloride migration rate can be determined from two of 
chloride concentration measurement in sampling time region following the initial current. The 
future work is required to obtain enough data to prove the feasible way on rapid method for 
estimating the steady state chloride migration rate. 
  78
4.3 The rapid method for non-steady-state migration coefficient 
The electrochemical technique is applied to accelerate the chloride ion migration in mortar. 
Two approaches were used to obtain the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient. One of 
the approaches is to use the breakthrough time from chloride-time curve for determining the 
non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient. The other approach is to use the depth of 
chloride penetration into mortar for determining the non-steady-state chloride migration 
coefficient. In this approach, the chloride penetration depth is obtained from the chloride 
penetration profile in mortar. In addition, a simplified test procedure is developed to predict the 
chloride penetration profile by using measurement of the total charge passed and the surface 
chloride content to obtain the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient. 
4.3.1 Breakthrough time and non-steady-state migration coefficient from chloride 
concentration 
Studying on the chloride-time curve obtained from accelerated chloride migration test 
(ACMT) of cement based materials is a way to understand the non-steady-state chloride 
migration coefficient [24, 50]. In the ACMT, chloride ions transport in concrete under an 
applied electrical potential. The term of diffusion generally denotes diffusion caused by 
chemical potential. The gradient of the chemical potential acts a force ( f ) on the ions present 
in unit volume of solution is [12].

exists along the migration of direction, the driving force will be:

where RTREz /=β , 0C  is the chloride concentration in the source cell, erfc is

 From Eq. (4-13), when the electrical field is large enough and the penetration depth is

The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient in Eq. (4-14) is determined based on the 
measurement of the breakthrough time for chloride ions penetrated through the specimen [24]. 
The typical result of cumulative chloride concentration in transition period is plotted in Fig. 
4.42. Since the chloride concentration was not continually monitored and the duration of 
chloride ions penetrate over through the specimen was not easy to determine, a regression line is 
carried out for the transition period of the chloride-time curve to determine the time-span for 
chloride ion penetration through specimen as:

where aC  is chloride concentration gained in anode cell in mole/L, t  is the elapsed time in h,

in anode cell was considered a small number to determine the breakthrough time as the average

Considering the average penetration depth is equal to the specimen thickness ( x =5cm), 
the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient ( nM ) can be determined based on the 
breakthrough time ( bt ). According to the test results of breakthrough time in Table 4.8, the 
non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient ( nM ) for each specimen was calculated by 
using the Eq. (4-14) and presented in Table 4.8. The non-steady-state chloride migration 
coefficient ( nM ) relative to the external electrical potential for all mixes are shown in Fig. 4.47. 
It can be observed in Fig. 4.47 that the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient ( nM ) 
increase with the increasing w/c ratio, and the higher external applied electrical potential 
resulted in a higher non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient as the applied electrical 
potential over 30 volts. A higher external applied electrical potential used in ACMT might 
increase the velocity of chloride ions migration in cement-based materials.

4.3.2 Influence of accelerated migration time on non-steady-state chloride profile  
In this study, the chloride penetration profiles in mortar with various accelerated migration 
time and various applied electrical potential were investigated in ACMT. In addition to the 
electrical current was recorded by a data logger during the experimental program. Table 4.9 
shows that the five different of accelerated migration times and five different of applied 
electrical potentials were used to accelerate chloride ions penetration into mortar specimen of 
each mixes in ACMT, to study the effect of accelerated migration time and applied electrical 
potential on the chloride penetration profile of mortar in non-steady state.

Significant amounts of chloride have migrated into the specimen over a period of test. The 
chloride penetration profiles resulting from five different of accelerated migration times at a 
potential difference of 24 volt for MC35, MC45, MC55, and MC65 are shown in Fig. 4.49 to 
Fig. 4.52, respectively. It can be seen in Fig. 4.49 to Fig. 4.52, the chloride content is decreasing 
with the chloride penetration depth for each test specimen, and the depth of chloride penetrated 
into specimen is increasing with the accelerated migration time. For example, the chloride 
penetrated depths of MC35 with five different accelerated migration times in Fig. 4.49 are about 
1.6 cm, 2.4 cm, 3 cm, 4.6 cm, and deeper over than the specimen thickness (> 5cm), 
respectively. The chloride content at each slice is increasing with the accelerated migration time, 
and the chloride ions at a certain depth were cumulated in the specimen until the chloride 
content value nearest by the first slice, the chloride content at a selected depth of 10 mm of each 
specimen are about 0.1%, 0.42%, 0.63%, 0.65%, and 0.64%, respectively. The trend of chloride 
content-depth curve generated for increasing accelerated migration time as can be seen in Fig. 
4.49 to Fig. 4.52. However, the chloride content at the first slice increases slightly with the 
accelerated migration time, expect the tests of MC45-24V-53.7h, and MC55-24V-38.2h. The 
means of chloride content at the first slice ( 1C ) are 0.593, 0.551, 0.526, and 0.507 for MC35, 
MC45, MC55, and MC65, respectively. The results for test using various accelerated migration 
time indicate that there is no signification effect on the chloride content at the first slice.

(w/c) and the surface chloride content obtained from ACMT with the accelerated migration time 
of 24 hour and the applied electrical potential of 24 volt. By linear regression analysis, it can be 
seen that surface chloride content decreases with increasing of water-to-cement ratio.

4.3.2.3 Chloride penetration depth and non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient 
In order to determine the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient from chloride 
penetration profile of specimen, the chloride penetration depth is calculated from the chloride 
penetration profile. Using the chloride transport ability ( D ) and the surface chloride content 
( sC ) from the chloride penetration profile in Table 4.14, the chloride penetration depth ( dx ) 
corresponding to the total chloride content in concrete of %1.0=C  for each test specimen is 
calculated from Eq. (4-16) and listed in Table 4.16. McGrath and Hooton [56] mentioned that 
the 0.1% chloride content by mass of concrete value typically provided a precise and 
reproducible chloride penetration depth measurement. Using the test result of the chloride 
penetration depth ( dx ), applied electrical potential and the accelerated migration time ( t ) for 
each mixes in Table 4.16, the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient obtained from the 
experimental chloride penetration profile ( neM ) was calculated by using the modified Fick’s 
second law in Eq. (4-14) and presented in Table 4.16. The chloride penetration depth ( dx ) in 
Table 4.16 increase with the increasing accelerated migration time, however, the accelerated 
migration time have no signification effect on the non-steady-state chloride migration 
coefficient ( neM ) obtained from the experimental chloride penetration profile in mortar, the 
average of non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient ( neM ) for mixes of MC35, MC45, 
MC55, and MC65 at a potential difference of 24 volt are 7.61, 14.99, 21.51, and 25.96 
( scm /10 28−× ), respectively.  
 
 
 
  106
the cut slices taken from the ACMT samples after completion of the test for the specimens of 
MC35, MC45, MC55, and MC65 are listed from Table 4.17 to Table 4.20 respectively. The total 
chloride is expressed as percentage of the dry mass of specimen and the depth is the mid-point 
of each slice from the exposed chloride surface including the approximate 1.2 mm depletion by 
cutting.  
The chloride penetration profiles resulting from five different of applied electrical 
potentials for MC35, MC45, MC55, and MC65 are shown from Fig. 4.64 to Fig. 4.67, 
respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4.64 to Fig. 4.67, the depth of chloride penetrated into 
concrete is increasing with the applied electrical potential (V ). The chloride content at each 
slice is increasing with the applied electrical potentials, and the chloride ions at a selected depth 
were cumulated in the specimen until the chloride content value nearest by the first slice. The 
chloride content at a selected depth of 10 mm of MC35 with five different of applied electrical 
potentials shown in Fig. 4.64 are about 0.5%, 0.61%, 0.63%, 0.68%, and 0.71%, respectively. 
The trend of chloride content-depth curve generated for increasing applied electrical potential as 
can be seen from Fig. 4.64 to Fig. 4.67. The chloride content at the first slice increase slightly 
with the applied electrical potential (V ), the means of chloride content at the first slice are 
0.66%, 0.58%, 0.56%, and 0.55% for MC35, MC45, MC55, and MC65, respectively. The 
results for test using various applied electrical potential indicate that there is no signification 
effect on the chloride content at the first slice, and the chloride content at first slice decrease 
with the increased of water-to-cement ratio.

4.3.3.3 Chloride penetration depth and non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient 
The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient can be calculated using the chloride

of chloride transport ability ( D ) and the surface chloride content ( sC ) from the curve fitting by 
using Eq. (4-16), the chloride penetration depth ( dx ) corresponding to the total chloride content 
in concrete of %1.0=C  for each test specimen is calculated from Eq. (4-16) and listed in 
Table 4.23. Using the chloride penetration depth ( dx ), the accelerated migration time ( t ), and 
applied electrical potential (V ) for each tested specimen in Table 4.23, the non-steady-state 
chloride migration coefficient ( neM ) obtained from the chloride profile was calculated by using 
the modified Fick’s second law in Eq. (4-14) and presented in Table 4.23.

under a potential difference of 24 volt is shown in Fig. 4.77. The measurement of initial 
electrical current ( iI ) and final electrical current ( fI ) for all test specimens are listed in Table 
4.24 and Table 4.25.  
 
Fig. 4.77—Typical result of electrical current at a different potential of 24 voltage 
The test results in Table 4.24 and Table 4.25 show that the initial electrical current 
increases with both of the increasing of the water-to-binder ratio and the applied electrical 
potential. However, the final electrical current ( fI ) shows that no significant change compared 
with the initial current ( iI ), except the higher water-to-cement ratio specimen under higher 
applied electrical potential such as MC55-42V, MC65-36V, and MC65-42V. The variation of 
electrical current illustrates that the effect of ions in pore solution on the electrical current is not 
significant after the chloride ions penetration into mortar specimen.

respectively. The Fig. 4.78 and Fig. 4.79 show that the total charge passed increase with

4.3.5 Charge passed and total amount of chloride 
 The transference number of an ion in a given electrolyte solution is the fraction of the total 
electrical current carried in the solution by that ion [11]. Every specie in the electrolyte has a 
transference number, it , which must always be positive and between zero and one. According 
to the definition, the chloride transference number, clt  , can be calculated by the following 
equation as: 
Q
Q
I
It clclcl ==              (4-21) 
where clI  is the electrical current carried in the solution by chloride ions, and clQ  is the 
charge passed carried by chloride ions. 
 According to the Faraday’s results, the charge passed carried by chloride ions ( clQ ) is 
determined by the mole number of chloride that pass through the circuit. By definition: 
FzNQ clclcl =             (4-22) 
where clN  is the mole number of chloride in the anode cell in mole. From Eq. (4-21) and Eq. 
(4-22), the chloride transference number, clt , can be written: 
Q
FzN
t clclcl =              (4-23) 
 From Eq. (4-23), when the chloride ions penetrate into concrete in non-steady state, the 
total amount of chloride, m , is written: 
Q
Fz
ntnNm clclclcl =⋅=            (4-24) 
where cln  is the atomic mass of chloride (35.5 g/mol). The Eq. (4-24) shows that there is a 
relationship between the total amount of chloride ( m ) in non-steady state and the total charge 
  128
chloride ( m ) and charge passed ( Q ), and the correlation coefficient is 0.971. It indicates that 
the total amount of chloride ( m ) can be determined by using Eq. (4-25) from the measurement 
of the charge passed. The total amount of chloride obtained from charge passed ( Qm ) for all 
mixes with five different accelerated migration times are listed in Table 4.26, and the total 
amount of chloride obtained from charge passed ( Qm ) for all mixes with five different 
accelerated migration times are listed in Table 4.27. 
4.3.6 The rapid method to determine the chloride profile from the charge passed 
and the surface chloride content 
 The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient obtained from the chloride profile in 
non-steady has the disadvantage of requiring chloride profile grinding and the numerical 
complexity. An alternative rapid method is provided to determine the chloride profile in this 
study. According to the definition of total amount of chloride in specimen from chloride profile 
in Eq. (4-18), the solution of this equation can be calculated as:

transport ability of mortar ( D ) can be written as: 
VtC
LmD
s π2
224=              (4-27)

chloride content of first slice by using Eq. (4-29) for all mixes with five different accelerated 
migration times are listed in Table 4.26, and the prediction of surface chloride contents ( spC ) 
for all mixes with five different applied electrical potentials are listed in Table 4.27. 
The total amount of chloride in specimen ( Qm ) determined from the measurement of the 
total charge passed ( Q ), and the surface chloride content ( spC ) from the chloride content of 
first slice for all test specimen in Table 4.26 and Table 4.27 were used to obtain the non-steady 
state chloride profile in concrete by using Eq. (4-28). The figures from 4.82 to 4.86 illustrate the 
predicted curve of chloride penetration profile (dash line) and the chloride penetration profile 
obtained from the curve fitting based on experimental data (solid line) of the mix of MC35 with 
the accelerated migration time of 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 98.4 h under a potential difference 
of 24 volt, respectively. It can seen in Fig. 4.82, the surface chloride content ( 0=x ) obtained 
from the predicted chloride penetration profile is lower than the surface chloride content from 
the experimental chloride penetration profile, however, the predicted curve of chloride profile is 
very match to the chloride penetration profile obtained from the curve fitting based on the 
experimental data, as can be seen from Fig. 4.82 to Fig. 4.86. The figures from 4.87 to 4.91 
illustrate the predicted chloride penetration profile and the experimental chloride penetration 
profile of the mix of MC45 with five different accelerated migration times (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 
and 53.7 h) under a potential difference of 24 volt, respectively. From the Fig. 4.87 to Fig. 4.91 
appear that the predicted curve is close to the experimental chloride penetration profile, expect 
the test specimen of MC45-24V-53.7h cause by the lower chloride content of first slice ( 1C ). 
The predicted curve and the experimental chloride penetration profile of the mix of MC55 with 
five difference accelerated migration times (6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, and 38.4 h) under a potential 
  132
According to the results of predicted chloride profile from the Fig. 4.82 to Fig. 4.121, the 
predicted curve of chloride penetration profile based on the measurement of the coulombs and 
the measurement of the chloride content in first slice appears that it’s a rapid way to evaluate the 
chloride profile in non-steady state.

4.3.7 The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient from the rapid method  
By using the prediction curve of chloride penetration profile, the prediction of chloride 
penetration depth ( dpx ) corresponding to the total chloride content in concrete of %1.0=C  
[56] for all mixes test with five accelerated migration times and with five applied electrical 
potentials were calculated and listed in Table 4.28 and Table 4.29. A comparison of the chloride 
penetration depth dpx  obtained from the measurement of the total charge passed ( Q ) in Table 
4.28 and Table 4.29 with the chloride penetration depth dx  from the measurement of the 
chloride content in Table 4.16 and Table 4.23 is demonstrated in Fig. 4.122. By linear regression 
analysis, a good linear correlation was found between the predicted chloride penetration depth 
( dpx ) and the chloride penetration depth ( dx ) from experimental result, and the value of dpx  is 
very close to the dx .

profile and dpx  from the predicted chloride profile

migration coefficient ( nM ) obtained from the measurement of chloride content is given in Fig. 
4.123. The measurement of the coulomb and the chloride content in the first slice of 5 mm 
thickness obtained from ACMT is a rapid way to estimate the non-steady-state chloride 
migration coefficient.  
4.3.8 Summary of simplify test procedure to determine the non-steady-state 
chloride migration coefficient 
Since the chloride penetration profile in non-steady state obtained from ACMT needs to 
collect the powder samples at selected depth for chloride analysis, the test procedure was 
considered time-consuming, exhausting, and expensive. In order to avoid collecting the powder 
samples for chloride analysis, the rapid and simple way to obtain the chloride penetration profile 
in non-steady state and the non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient can be follow: 
1. Measure the electrical current and calculate the total charge passed ( Q ) during the test in 
ACMT. 
2. Determine the predicted total amount of chloride ( Qm ) from the measurement of the total 
charge passed (Q ) by using Eq. (4-25). 
3. Measure the chloride content in first slice approximately 5 mm exposure to the surface ( 1C ), 
and calculate the predicted surface chloride content ( sC ) by using Eq. (4-29). 
4. Determine the predicted chloride penetration profile based on the predicted total amount of 
chloride ( Qm ) and the predicted surface chloride content ( sC ) using the Eq. (4-28). 
5. Calculate the predicted chloride penetration depth ( dpx ) at 0.1% chloride content from the 
predicted chloride penetration profile. 
6. Calculate the predicted non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient ( npM ) based on the

CONCLUSIONS  
Cement-based materials resistance to chloride ingress can be determined from the chloride 
migration rate and chloride penetration profile obtained from the proposed ACMT. The steady 
state chloride migration coefficient of concrete based on the chloride migration rate was 
obtained in the steady state stage. The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient based on 
the chloride penetration profile in the non-steady state was obtained. Based on the results 
obtained from the present experimental investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn. 
5.1 Steady state chloride migration coefficient 
(1) The chloride migration rate ( clK ), the slop of the chloride-time curve at the steady state, is 
constant for all mixes studied. 
(2) The chloride migration rate ABK  is obtained from the results of the start point A and the 
end point B of the steady state, and clK  is obtained from the chloride-time curve in the 
steady state. There is a close relationship between the ABK  and the clK  
( ABcl KK 027.1=  and R2  = 0.994). This indicates that the chloride migration rate can be 
determined with any of the two chloride concentrations and they corresponding time 
obtained from the steady state. 
(3) The start time AT  and end time BT  of steady state and the measurement of initial 
electrical current obtained from ACMT depends on the concrete characteristics. The time 
AT  and BT  increase with the decrease of the initial electrical current, and a non-linear 
correlation exist between the start time of steady state AT , the end time of steady state BT  
  162
(2) The total amount of chloride and total charge passed increase with the increasing 
accelerated migration time and the applied electrical potential, and a closely linear 
relationship exists between the total amount of chloride ( m ) and total charge passed ( Q ), 
the correlation coefficient is 0.971. The total amount of chloride can be determined by the 
measurement of the total charge passed using Eq. (4-25). 
(3) The surface chloride content is 1.07 times higher than the chloride content getting from the 
first slice cutting from exposure chloride surface. The surface chloride content can be 
obtained form the first slice approximately 5 mm cutting from the exposure surface. 
(4)  The prediction curve of chloride penetration profile can be determined from the total 
amount of chloride Qm  and the surface chloride content spC . 
(5) The prediction curve of chloride penetration profile is very match to the chloride penetration 
profile obtained from the experimental result of chloride content in concrete. A good linear 
correlation was found between the chloride penetration depth obtained from measurement 
of the coulomb ( dpx ) and the measurement of the chloride concentration in concrete ( dx ). 
(6) As mentioned previously, the total amount of chloride and the surface chloride content can 
be determined by the rapid method to predict the chloride profile in the specimen, and the 
chloride penetration depth corresponding to %1.0=C  can be calculated from the 
chloride profile. The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient can be calculated based 
on the chloride penetration depth and accelerated migration time by using modified Fick’s 
second law.

A Rapid Method for Determination of the Chloride Migration
Coefficient in Concrete Using Electrical Field
ABSTRACT: The chloride migration test has been widely used in recent years to evaluate the durability of
concrete. However, the traditional technique of chloride analysis required a large number of samples and is
time-consuming and expensive. This paper presents a simplified procedure for measuring the steady-state
chloride migration coefficient in concrete using the accelerated chloride migration test ACMT. Sixteen
mixes of concrete were tested at three curing ages. From the test results, the measurement of the initial
electrical current and chloride-time curve in steady state period, the union of fixed time was obtained from
the maximum of starting time and the minimum of ending time in the steady-state period following the
measurement of the initial electrical current. According to the measurement of initial electrical current and
the union fixed time, ACMT provides an accurate and rapid way to estimate the chloride migration coeffi-
cient based on the chloride migration rate by using the Nernst-Planck equation.
KEYWORDS: chloride migration rate, initial electrical current, steady state, ACMT
INTRODUCTION
The resistance to chloride ion penetration into concrete is a significant parameter that affects the durability
of reinforced concrete structure especially when the structure is exposed to a marine environment, deicing
salts, or both. In the past, a conventional diffusion method was often conducted to evaluate the chloride
diffusion characteristics of cement-based materials by using the steady-state chloride flow across the
specimen 1. However, the conventional diffusion method requires considerable time to obtain the steady-
state chloride flow across a specimen, and it needs to sample and analyze the chloride content of the
solution used for the tests. The disadvantages of the conventional diffusion test are that it is time-
consuming, laborious, and expensive.
Many methods of rapid chloride ion diffusion have been developed based on the application of an
external electrical field. One of them is the Rapid Chloride Permeability Test RCPT ASTM C1202-97
2, which was developed by Whiting 3. The rapid chloride permeability test has been largely used in
recent years to evaluate the quality of concrete. Based on the review of the references in RCPT ASTM
C1202, Feldman et al. 4 showed that a good correlation between total charge passed and both initial
current and electrical conductivity measured at the beginning of the test. McCarter et al. 5 reported that
the conductivity of the free pore fluid increases with increased temperature and that the applied electrical
potential of RCPT heats up the concrete specimen, thus affecting the flow speed. Julio-Betancourt and
Hooton 6 pointed that the 1-min conductivity test, using the RCPT test equipment could be a practical
way of improving the RCPT standard. Pfeifer et al. 7, and McGrath and Hooton 8 mentioned that
reliable and proper correlations might not exist between the RCPT results and 90-day salt ponding test
results. The RCPT procedures should not be used in the specification without proper correlation to a
long-term test. Several methods for accelerated chloride diffusion have been proposed by applying an
electrical field to accelerate the ingress of chloride ions. Tang and Nilsson 9 introduced a method as an
accelerated non-steady-state migration test, the chloride penetration profile in concrete was used to deter-
mine the chloride diffusion coefficient by using modified Fick’s second law. Meck and Sirivivatnanon 10
set up the correlation of chloride penetration depth obtained from the colorimetric method and total charge
passed of RCPT. Several studies 11–13 used the electrical migration method to calculate the chloride
diffusion coefficients by using the change of chloride concentration in the downstream cell. Truc et al. 14

Before the vacuum saturation, the slides or specimens were air dry for 1 h, and the lateral surface of
the specimens was coated with epoxy. The specimens were then placed in a vacuum desiccative chamber
containing a pressure less than 1 mmHg for 3 h. The specimens were then immersed into de-aerated water
at the same vacuum pressure level as before for one more hour. After then, the specimens were taken out
from the chamber and kept in de-aerated water for at least 18 h before the ACMT set-up.
Experimental Procedure
The electrochemical technique was used to accelerate the migration of chloride ions in concrete to estimate
the chloride migration coefficient. A schematic diagram of the test set-up is illustrated in Fig. 1 13,16.
The specimen was placed between two acrylic cells. One of the cells was filled with 4.5 L of 0.3 N NaOH
solution and the other with 4.5 L of 3 % NaCl solution. The brass meshes  10 mm, # 20 mesh were
placed on the side of the specimen as electrodes, respectively. The cells were connected with a 24 V DC
power source, where the NaOH electrode acted as anode and NaCl electrode as cathode. The electrical
current was measured and recorded at 5-min intervals using a data logger. The quantity of chloride ions
passing through the specimen in anode cell was measured and determined periodically using potentiomet-
ric titration with 0.01 N silver nitrate AgNO3 solution.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Steady-State Migration Coefficient in ACMT
In this study, the chloride concentration was determined from the solution in the anode cell. For each
concrete mix, the chloride concentration was the average of the results of three tests samples. The typical
result of chloride concentration is plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of time. Figure 2 shows that three stages
exist, non-steady state, steady state, and attenuate with respect to the change of the chloride concentration
17. In the non-steady state, the chloride ions are in the process of migrating through saturated pores in
concrete and have not yet reached the anode cell. In the steady-state stage between points A and B in Fig.
2, the flux of chloride ions passing through the concrete specimen becomes constant. Points A and B are
obtained from the linear regression when the best correlation coefficient R21 of the linear line is found
by using trial and error method. In the attenuate, however, the amount of chlorides emerging to the anode
cell starts to decrease.
The times TA and TB corresponding to the points A and B in Fig. 2 and the duration of steady state TBA
TBA=TB−TA for all mixes are listed in Table 2. The start time TA and the end time TB of steady state vary
from 21 h to 333 h and 80 h to 637 h, respectively. The start time TA and the end time TB decrease with
the increase in w/b ratio and they show significant increases for concrete containing mineral admixtures.
The duration of steady state TBA ranges between 55 h and 315 h for all mixes, and it decreases with the
increase w/b ratio except for mixes S35, S45, and SF45.

regression analysis. By linear regression, the relationship between KAB and Kcl is derived as:

during steady state for SF series. Unfortunately, because the initial time Ti for SF series is longer than the
terminal time Tf, the empty set of the union fixed time for SF series is observed in Fig. 5b.
Initial Electrical Current and Duration of Steady State
In this study, the electrical current across the cells was recorded with a data logger during the experiment.
Measurements of initial electrical current Ii at the beginning of the ACMT for each specimen are
presented in Table 6. The initial electrical current in all test results varies from 13 mA to 181 mA. The
initial electrical current for series F, S, SF at 56 days and 91 days is lower than 36 mA, while the others
are higher than 44 mA.
The initial electrical current Ii obtained from ACMT relative to w/b ratios for all mixes at curing age
of 28 days, 56 days, and 91 days are shown in Figs. 6a–6c, respectively. In Fig. 6, the initial electrical
current increases with the increase of the w/b ratio at curing age of 28 days for all mixes. At curing ages
of 56 days and 91 days, the initial electrical current increases with the increased w/b ratio, but the others
are not significant different when the w/b ratio increases. For concrete containing mineral admixtures, the
initial electrical current decreases significantly.
Figures 7 and 8 show the initial electrical current obtained from ACMT versus the starting time TA and
the ending time TB during the steady state for all mixes at three curing ages. The starting time TA and the
ending time TB of the steady state increase with the decrease of the initial electrical current.
As previously mentioned, the empty set of the union fixed time in some cases is observed. To avoid
this condition, the initial current is used to obtain the initial time Ti and the terminal time Tf during the
steady state. The initial electrical current is classified into four ranks in this investigation: greater than
80 mA rank 1, 51–80 mA rank 2, 21–50 mA rank 3, and less than 20 mA rank 4. To determine the
distribution of the initial time Ti and the terminal time Tf during the steady state in ACMT with four ranks
of the initial electrical current, ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4, are shown in Figs. 9b–9d, respectively. The union
of fixed time in the steady-state period is defined as the time between the maximum of start time TA and
the minimum of terminal time TB in steady state for each rank. In rank 1 the initial electrical current Ii
greater than 80 mA, a union time of steady state from 40 h to 80 h Ti to Tf is obtained in Fig. 9a. In
Figs. 9b–9d, the union times for rank 2 Ii=51–80 mA, rank 3 Ii=21–50 mA, and rank 4 Ii
20 mA are 79–128 h, 201–245 h, and 333–415 h, respectively. The initial time Ti and the terminal
time Tf during the steady state in ACMT for each rank are shown in Table 7.
Since the accelerated chloride migration test needs to take a great amount of chloride sampling and
analysis to obtain the chloride-time curve, this kind of test is laborious and expensive. In order to reduce

the sampling and analyzing of chlorides during the ACMT, the initial electrical current is measured at the
beginning of ACMT, and the appropriate sampling time region according to the initial current can be
obtained from Table 7. Using any two chloride concentrations measured in the anode cell during the
sampling time region between the initial time Ti and the terminal time Tf and the sampling time, the
chloride migration rate is calculated by Eq 3. The steady-state chloride migration coefficient Ms based on
the chloride migration rate can be calculated by using the Nernst-Planck equation in Eq 2.
CONCLUSION
Concrete resistance to chloride ingress can be determined from the chloride migration rate obtained from
the proposed ACMT. Based on the results obtained from the present experimental investigation, the
following conclusions can be drawn.
1 ACMT results typically show three stages non-steady state, steady state, and attenuate of
changes in the chloride concentration of tested concrete specimens.
2 The chloride migration rate Kcl, the slope of the chloride-time curve at the steady state is
constant for all mixes studied.
3 The chloride migration rate KAB, obtained from the results of the initial point A and the end point
B of the steady state, has a close relationship with Kcl Kcl=1.027KAB and R2=0.994. This
indicates that the chloride migration rate can be determined with any of the two chloride concen-
trations and they corresponding time obtained from the steady state.
4 The duration of steady state TBA of the concrete specimens studied ranges from 55 h to 315 h,
which can be divided into four durations according to the initial electrical current. The durations
of sampling time for rank 1 Ii80 mA, rank 2 Ii=51–80 mA, rank 3 Ii=21–50 mA, and
rank 4 Ii20 mA are 40–80 h, 79–128 h, 201–245 h, and 333–415 h, respectively. The dura-
tions of sampling time allow enough time to obtain two chloride concentrations in the steady state.
The four ranks of initial electrical current can be used to determine the sampling time region as
shown in Table 7. Any of the two chloride concentration and sampling time obtained in the
sampling time region steady state can be used to calculate the chloride migration rate and the
steady-state migration coefficient.
5 The chloride migration coefficient can be determined from two random samplings and chloride
analysis in the union of fixed time region. This method provides an accurate and rapid way to
obtain the chloride migration coefficient.

RELATION BETWEEN THE CHLORIDE MIGRATION
COEFFICIENTS OF CONCRETE FROM THE COLOURIMETRIC
METHOD AND THE CHLORIDE PROFILE METHOD
Chung-Chia Yang* and C. T. Chiang
ABSTRACT
In this study the electrochemical technique is applied to accelerate chloride ion
migration in concrete to determine its transport property.  After the accelerated chlo-
ride migration test (ACMT; the electrochemical technique is applied to accelerate
chloride ion migration), the penetration depths of the colourimetric method were de-
tected by 0.1 N AgNO3 and the chloride penetration profiles of the profile method
were obtained from the chloride content of each depth.  The chloride migration coef-
ficients were calculated from the modified Fick’s second law based on the colourimetric
method and the chloride profile method.  In order to develop a better understanding of
the relationship between the migration coefficient obtained from the colourimetric
method and the chloride profile method, the migration coefficient obtained from those
two methods are compared.  The experimental result shows that the migration coeffi-
cients obtained from the colourimetric method and the chloride profile method are
linearly correlated, and the concentration of color change boundary, Cd = 0.07 mol/L,
can be used to determine the migration coefficient regardless of the concrete type.
Key Words: chloride migration coefficient, colourimetric, chloride profile, accelerated
chloride migration test.

I. INTRODUCTION
Chloride ions play a major role in the corrosion
of rebar embedded in concrete.  Therefore, the resis-
tance of chloride ion penetration into concrete is a
crucial parameter affecting the durability of rein-
forced concrete structures.  In order to improve con-
crete performance, it is essential to have a reliable
and simple method for determining and calculating
the transport properties in concrete.
The depth of chloride ions into concrete is usu-
ally obtained by the chloride content at various depths
(profile) in concrete.  An easy and quick method of
spraying silver nitrate on a cross-section of split con-
crete to identify the depth of chloride penetration into
the specimen is called the colourimetric method
(Colleparde et al., 1970), and the depth of penetra-
tion can be used to determine the non-steady-state
diffusivity (Tang and Nilsson, 1992).
Otsuki et al. (1992) found the free chloride con-
centration at the color change boundary was on the
order of 0.15% by weight of cement.  In Collepardi
(1995), the color change was found to be in the range
of approximately 0.01% by weight of cement as free
chloride content.  Andrade et al. (1999) pointed out
that the value of total chloride content at which the
change of color took place for concrete was 0.18 ±
0.2% by concrete weight or 1.13 ±1.4% by cement
weight (95% confidence).  Using the chloride pro-
files and the chloride front determined by 0.05 N
AgNO3 after a wetting and drying salt ponding test,
McPolin et al. (2005) found that the total chloride
content at the coloruimetric front varied from approxi-
mately 0.5 to 1.5% by weight of cement.  Meck and
Sirivivatnanon (2003) showed that the average level
of soluble chloride detected at the color-change bound-
aries was 0.9% by weight of binder or 0.12% by weight

the electrical field was applied primarily across the
test specimen.  One of the cells was filled with 0.30
N NaOH solution and the other cell was with 0.52 N
NaCl solution.  The cells were connected to a 24 V
power source for 24 hours in which the NaOH elec-
trode became the anode and the NaCl electrode be-
came the cathode.
After switching off the electrical field, the speci-
mens were split into two halves and the chloride pro-
file was determined by analyzing the total chloride
concentration at different depths.  The other half was
used to measure the penetration of chlorides by us-
ing the colourimetric method.
(i) The Total Chloride Content Profile
The cylindrical specimen (φ20 × 50 mm) was
obtained by coring from one of the halves specimens
as shown in Fig. 2(a).  Each cylindrical specimen was
cut from the surface exposed to chloride in seven 7-
mm thick slices as shown in Fig. 2(b).  The concrete
slices were dried at 105°C to a constant mass and then
ground to pass through a 300-µm sieve.  The pow-
dered samples were analyzed for total chloride con-
tent in accordance with AASHTO T260.
(ii) Colourimetric Method
In this study, the colourimetric method used was
similar to the test described in NT BUILD 492.  After
splitting the specimens, a silver nitrate aqueous solu-
tion (0.1 N AgNO3) was sprayed on one of the halves
specimen.  The chloride penetration depth was mea-
sured from the visible white silver chloride precipitation.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Migration Coefficient from Colourimetric
Method
The colourimetric penetration depths detected
by 0.1 N AgNO3 for all mixes are given in Table 2.
In this study, chloride ions transport the concrete
sample under a 24V voltage by using the ACMT.  The
non-steady-state migration coefficient (Mn) is calcu-
lated from the modified Fick’s second law (Tang,
1996):

where: C is the concentration of ions as a function of
distance x, at any time t, z is the electrical charge of
chloride, F is the Faraday constant, E is the strength
of the electric field between the anode and cathode;
R is the universal gas constant; T is absolute temperature.
For ACMT, the following conditions are used to ob-
tain the solution of Eq. (1), where: initial condition:
C = 0, x > 0, t = 0; boundary condition: C = Co, x = 0,
t > 0; infinite-point condition: C = 0, x → ∞, t = tM;
where tM is a large finite number.  The analytical so-
lution for Eq. (1) is (Tang 1996)
C(x, t) = Co2 e
βxerfc x + βMnt2 Mnt + erfc
x – βMnt
2 Mnt
,
(2)
where β = z FERT ,  and erfc is the complementary er-
ror function.
From Eq. (2), when the electrical field is large
enough and the penetration depth is sufficient (x > βMnt),
the term eβxerfc(x + βMnt/2 Mnt ) → 0, and the mi-
gration coefficient can be calculated as (Tang, 1996):
Mn = 1β x – α xt , (3)
where α = 2 1β erf
– 1 1 – 2CCo
, and erf –1 is the in-
verse of the error function.

centration in the cathode cell, and C is the concentra-
tion of chloride in the pore solution corresponding to

value of C/Co = 0.07/0.52 and the measurement of chlo-
ride penetration depth at which the color change is found.
In the chloride profile method, the migration coeffi-
cient is determined based on the measurement of chloride
penetration for 0.02% chloride content (C = 0.02%),
and the curve-fitted value of surface chloride content
(Co) which is obtained according to Eq. (4).   In Eq.
(3), α is the sole parameter that is affected by the ratio
of C/Co.  In order to evaluate the influence of C/Co on
the migration coefficient by using the colourimetric
method and the chloride profile method, the ratio of α
obtained from the colourimetric method and the chlo-
ride profile method is defined as
Ra =
αcp
αcol
, (6)
where αcp and αcol are the values of α obtained from
the chloride profile method and the colourimetric
method, respectively.
Figure 8 shows the relationship between Ra and
w/b ratio for all mixes.  Each series (C, F, S, SF) data
in Fig. 8 is obtained by linear regression analysis, and
the best fit is obtained as:
Ra = 0.21(w/b) + 1.31   for series C, (7)
Ra = 0.56(w/b) + 0.92   for series F, (8)
Ra = 0.65(w/b) + 0.99   for series S, (9)
Ra = 0.57(w/b) + 0.98   for series SF. (10)
The value of αcp obtained from the chloride profile
method is higher than the value of αcol obtained from
the colourimetric method for all mixes.  In Fig. 8, the
Ra ratio increases with the increase in w/b ratio, be-
cause the surface chloride content obtained from the
chloride profile increases as the w/b ratio increases.
The Ra ratio for series C is higher than those of the
other three series (S, F, and SF) with the same w/b
ratios.  In Eqs. (7)-(10), the slop of series C is lower
than the series S, F, and SF, but the difference be-
tween series S, F, and SF is not significant.  The value
of α is influence by the w/b ratios and types of
concrete.
5. The Migration Coefficient from Colourimetric
Method and Chloride Profile Method
In this study, the migration coefficient in Eq.
(3) is determined by three main variables, i.e., the
chloride penetration depth x, the chloride concentra-
tion C, and the initial chloride concentration Co.  It
was mentioned previously that the migration coeffi-
cient obtained from the colourimetric method, Mcol,
is determined based on a constant value of C/Co =
0.07/0.52 and the measurement of chloride penetra-
tion depth at which the color change is found.  The
migration coefficient obtained from the chloride pro-
file method, Mcp, is determined based on the mea-
surement of chloride penetration for 0.02% chloride
content and the curve-fitted values of surface chlo-
ride content from the chloride profile.  A correlation
between the migration coefficient of Mcol obtained
from the colourimetric method (in Table 2) and Mcp
obtained from the chloride profile method (in Table
4) is shown in Fig. 9.  By linear regression, the em-
pirical relationship between Mcp and Mcol is statisti-
cally derived as
Mcp = 0.94Mcol + 0.82 × 10–12, (11)
where Mcp and Mcol are expressed in m2/s.  By linear
regression, the correlation coefficient R2 for the model
[Eq. (11)] is 0.976.  It appears that the migration co-
efficient Mcp obtained from the chloride profile
method correlates linearly with the migration coeffi-
cient Mcol obtained from the colourimetric method re-
gardless of concrete mixes.
In order to evaluate the influence of C = 0.07
mol/L on the calculation of migration coefficient, the
migration coefficient (Mcolp) is determined from the
depth at which the chloride content reached 0.02%
above chloride profile, and a constant value of C/Co
= 0.07/0.52 when the colourimetric method is used.

ABSTRACT 
The salt ponding test has been widely used in recent year to 
evaluate the durability of cement-based materials. However, 
the duration of more than 90 days salt ponding is considered as 
time-consuming.  In this study, the electrochemical technique 
(ACMT; Accelerated Chloride Migration Test) is applied to 
accelerate the movement of chloride ion in the cement-based 
materials to reduce the duration of testing time. The chloride 
profiles are obtained from ponding test with various ponding 
times and ACMT with different accelerated migration times.  
The total amount of chloride in specimens are calculated from 
the profiles and compared.  Based on the total amount of chlo-
ride, the equivalent accelerated chloride migration time to the 
ponding time is obtained.  The experimental result shows that 
the total amount of chloride for the 9-h, 10-h, 11-h, and 12-h 
accelerated migration time in ACMT is close to the 60-days, 
90-days, 120-days, and 150-days ponding time in ponding test, 
respectively. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Chloride-induced corrosion is one of the major causes af-
fecting the corrosion of reinforcement in concrete. Since the 
rate of penetration of the chloride into concrete is very slow, it 
is important to find a simple and short test to assess the resis-
tance of concrete to chloride penetration.   
 The salt ponding test (ASTM C1543) is a common method 
for measuring the penetration of chloride into concrete.  For the 
salt ponding test, chloride ions require considerable time to 
penetrate the concrete specimen.  Therefore, several acceler-
ated chloride ions diffusion test methods by the application of 
an electrical field were developed to accelerate the movement 
of chloride ions. Whiting [9] developed the rapid chloride

permeability test (RCPT) procedure.  A 60-V power source is 
applied to accelerate the movement of chloride ions, and the 
total charge passed is used to assess the concrete durability.  
Andrade and Whiting [2] obtained the diffusion coefficients 
from the ponding test and after the RCPT (ASTM C1202).  
They reported that the diffusion coefficients from the ponding 
test are greater than from the RCPT, and it was suggested to 
reduce the voltage drop and increase the test period in RCPT.  
McGrath and Hooton [6] found that there is a poor correlation 
between the results of charge passed from RCPT and diffusion 
characters from ponding test when the standard tests were 
conducted and the ponding data was analyzed in the conven-
tional manner.   
 In the past, a conventional diffusion method was often 
conducted to evaluate the chloride diffusion characteristic of 
cement-based materials by using the steady-state chloride flow 
across the specimen [3, 5, 7]. However, the conventional dif-
fusion method requires considerable time to obtain the 
steady-state chloride flow across the specimen and need sam-
pling and analyzing chlorides during the tests.  The disadvan-
tages of conventional diffusion test are time-consuming, labo-
rious and expensive. The accelerated chloride migration test 
(ACMT) for accelerated chloride migration has been proposed 
by applying an electrical field to accelerate the ingress of 
chloride ions [10-12].  Using ACMT, Yang and Cho [11] ob-
tained a correlation between the chloride migration rate and the 
electrical current measured at a given charge passed in steady 
state. Yang and Chiang [12] presents a simplified procedure for 
measuring the steady state chloride migration coefficient in 
concrete using the ACMT.  
 The objective of this work is to determine if there exist a 
direct relationship between the duration of ponding test and the 
accelerated migration time of ACMT.  The total amount of 
chloride determined from chloride profile in ponding test and 
ACMT are used to obtain the relation ship between ponding 
time and migration time. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM 
1. Materials and specimen preparation 
In this investigation, four kinds of mortar with water to ce-
ment ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.65 were used. ASTM Type I

 boiling distilled water. Filtrate and washings were made up 
about 125 to 150 ml with distilled water. The sample of filtrate 
was analyzed using potentiometric titration with 0.01N silver 
nitrate (AgNO3) solution for quantitative analysis.  
 
2.2. Salt ponding test 
In this study, the ponding test similar to the test described in 
ASTM C1543 was used.  Before the test, specimens were 
air-dried, and then the lateral surface of specimens was coated 
with epoxy that was allowed to harden for up to 24 h.  The 
specimens were sealed around the outside edge using the 
acrylic ring to create the dam for chloride solution (Fig. 3).  The 
specimens with dams were subjected to continuous ponding 
with 3.0% NaCl solutions to a depth of 15 mm for 60, 90, 120, 
and 150 days.  The top of acrylic ring was sealed with plastic 
wrap to minimize evaporation, and additional solution was 
added if necessary to maintain the 15 mm depth.  After ponding, 
the solution was removed and the specimens were allowed to 
dry.  And then the chloride penetration profile of specimens 
was obtained from the same procedure as ACMT. 
Following the EGC is the frame synchronization which is 
attained by correlation filtering. The timing synchronization 
block performs the spreading code acquisition and tracking. 
The code acquisition is conducted by convolving the received 
signal with a correlation filter. By locating the peaks of the filter 
output, one can roughly synchronize the received signal with 
the locally generated spreading signal. The code tracking is 
performed by using a modified noncoherent DLL, which 
fine-tunes the alignment between the received signal and the 
locally generated spreading signal. The operation of the modi-
fied noncoherent DLL will be explained later. With the aid of 
the synchronized timing, the DS/SS signal can be despreaded 
and demodulated properly. The adaptive DD-DFE following 
the DS/SS demodulator is used to cancel the residual inter-
symbol interference (ISI) in the demodulated signal. The 
channel decoder performs the BCH decoding to correct poten-
tial data errors caused by the channel impairments. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
1. Breakthrough time in ACMT 
In ACMT, the chloride concentration was determined from 
the solution in the anode cell, and the chloride concentration 
was the average of the results of three tests samples. The typical 
result of chloride concentration is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function 
of time. Figure 4 shows that three stages exist, non-steady state, 
transition period, and steady state with respect to the change of 
the chloride concentration. In the non-steady-state, the chloride 
ions are in the process of migrating through saturated pores in 
specimen and have not yet reached the anode cell. In the tran-
sition period, the first chloride ion starts to penetrate over 
through the specimen. The chloride-time curve of transition 
period is non-linear due to an uneven distribution of the chlo-
ride content in the specimen [8]. In the steady state, the flux of 
chloride ions passing through the specimen becomes constant. 
 
 The cumulative chloride concentrations in transition pe-
riod of M35, M45, M55, and M65 are plotted in Fig. 5 as a 
function of time. Since the chloride concentration was not 
continually monitored and the duration of chloride ions pene-
trate over through specimen was not easy to determine, a re-

increased slightly with the increasing accelerated migration 
time of all mixes. The results of the mixes test with various 
accelerated migration times indicate that there is no significa-

The total amount of diffusion substance in specimen as

4. The relation between accelerated chloride migration 
time and ponding time 
In the past, the 90-day salt ponding test has been conducted 
to evaluate the chloride diffusion characteristic of ce-
ment-based materials. The ponding test requires 90 days to 
obtain the chloride ions penetrate into the specimen.  The 
disadvantage of ponding test is time-consuming.  Therefore, 
ACMT method was used to accelerate the movement of chlo-
ride ions by the application of an external electrical field.  In 
order to obtain the relationship between the accelerated chlo-
ride migration time in ACMT and the ponding time in salt 
ponding test, the total amount of chloride penetrated into 
specimen is used.  The accelerated chloride migration time is 
determined based on the total amount of chloride (m) obtained 
from ponding test and ACMT.  The equivalent accelerated 
chloride migration time to the ponding time is obtained when 
the total amount of chloride is the same.  
 Both of the m−Q curve (from Eq. (12)) and the t−Q  
curve obtained from ACMT are shown in Fig. 12.  Examples 
of the total amount of chlorides penetrated into specimen from 
the 90-day and 120-day salt ponding test for M55 as shown in 
Fig. 12 are 0.701 and 0.831 %-cm.  The required charges are 
4571 and 6066 coulomb in ACMT, and the equivalent accel-
erated chloride migration times are 10.0 and 11.9 h.  The re-
quired charge and the equivalent accelerated chloride migra-
tion time for all mixes from different ponding time are listed in 
Table 6.  The test result and model presented in this study can 
be used to obtain the relationship between the accelerated 
chloride migration time in ACMT and the ponding time in salt 
ponding test.  The surface chloride content may not consider in 
the result presented. The comparison between the ACMT and 
ponding test determined total amount of chloride provides a 
direction to obtain the relationship between the accelerated 
chloride migration time in ACMT and the ponding time in salt 
ponding test.  The accelerated migration time in ACMT 
needed for obtaining consistent values of the total amount of 
chloride for cement-based materials equilibrated with 60-day, 
90-day, 120-day, and 150-day ponding time are approximately 
9 h, 10 h, 11 h, and 12 h, respectively.

I. Introduction 
The chloride diffusivity of cement-based materials is a fundamental property 
relating to the durability of reinforced concrete structures exposed to marine 
environments. The conventional chloride diffusion test (1 Page et al. 1981) and the salt 
ponding test are the long-term tests used for measuring the chloride flow across the 
specimen and the penetration of chloride into cement-based materials, respectively. 
Several methods for accelerated chloride diffusion have been proposed by applying 
an electrical field to accelerate the ingress of chloride ions in the non-steady state. Tang 
and Nilsson (1992) introduced a method, the accelerated non-steady-state migration test, 
and the chloride penetration profile in concrete was used to determine the chloride 
diffusion coefficient by using a modified form of Fick’s second law. Meck and 
Sirivivatnanon (2003) set up the correlation of chloride penetration depth obtained from 
the colourimetric method and charge passed during RCPT. Tong and Gjorv (2001) 
found a correlation between the initial electrical conductivity and the chloride 
 3 
are linearly correlated. Andrade et al. (1994) applied an electrical potential in the 
ponding test, and the diffusion coefficient was calculated from the chloride 
concentration at the penetration depth.  
Since the determination of the chloride profile involves removing of cement-based 
material samples from various depths for chloride analyses and plotting the chloride 
content against the depth, the procedure is laborious and expensive.  The main 
objective of this study is to establish the correlation between the charge passed during 
from the ACMT and the total amount of chloride in the specimen during the non-steady 
state. Using the charge passed and the surface chloride content determine the chloride 
profile, and calculate the non-steady state chloride migration coefficient. 
 
II. Experimental program 
1. Materials and specimen preparation 
In this study, four kinds of mortar with water to cement ratios ranging from 0.35 to 
0.65 were used. ASTM Type I Portland cement and river sand were used as binder and 
fine aggregate, respectively.  The specific gravity of fine aggregate was 2.71 and the 
fineness modulus was 3.05.  Details of the mix proportions for the mortar mixes are 
summarized in Table 1. The amount of fine aggregate was kept constant at 1380.1 kg/m3 
 5 
(anodic solution) and the cathodic cell with 4.5 liter of 0.52 mole/L NaCl solution 
(cathodic solution). Two mesh electrodes (10 cm diameter, #20 mesh brass screen) were 
placed one on each side of the specimen in such a way that the electrical field was 
applied primarily across the test specimen.  The cells were connected to a 24-V power 
source.  The cathode was connected to the negative pole and the anode was connected 
to the positive pole of the power supply. The electrical current was measured and 
recorded at 5-minute intervals by a data logger. 
 
(i) Measurement of the breakthrough time 
  In order to measure the quantity of chloride ions passing from the cathodic cell to 
the anode cell, the chloride ions were determined periodically using potentiometric 
titration with 0.01N silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution for quantitative analysis in the 
anode cell.  Three of the specimens for each mixes were tested to determine the 
chloride concentration-time curve.  The typical result of chloride concentration is 
plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of time. Fig. 2 shows that three stages exist, non-steady 
state, transition period, and steady state with respect to the change of the chloride 
concentration. In the non-steady-state, the chloride ions are in the process of migrating 
through saturated pores in the specimen and have not yet reached the anode cell. In the 
 7 
(ii) Measurement of the chloride penetration profile 
To measure the chloride profile of a specimen in non-steady state stage, four 
accelerated migration times less than the breakthrough time ( ) for each mix in Table 2 
were used. After ACMT, the specimen was removed from the acrylic cells, and the 
surface of each specimen was brushed by using a wire brush. Three cuboid specimens 
(2cm×2cm×5cm) were obtained by cutting from the ACMT specimen (φ10 cm×5cm), 
and the dry cut method was used to produce slices of 5-mm thickness as shown in Fig. 4. 
The slice specimens were then dried at 105℃ to constant mass and ground to pass 
through a 300-μm sieve. The acid soluble chloride was extracted from the powder and 
analyzed according to the specification in AASHTO T260-97. The sample was analyzed 
using potentiometric titration with 0.01N silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution for 
quantitative analysis.

III. Results and Discussion 
1. The chloride profile and the non-steady-state migration coefficient 
 After ACMT, the chloride content was determined by collecting the powder 
samples at different depths from the surface that was exposed to the NaCl solution. The 
chloride content at different depths is listed in Table 3; each data pointis the average of 
 9 
and ), and correlation coefficient (R2) for four series mixes are listed in Table 4.  ob
The chloride profiles of series C35 obtained after the ACMT with four accelerated 
migration times are shown in Fig. 5. The curves of experimental results fitted by Eq. (2) 
are also shown in this figure. It can be seen in Fig. 5, the chloride content is decreasing 
with the penetration depth for each specimen, and the depth the chloride penetrated into 
the specimen is increasing with the accelerated migration time. The chloride content at 
equal depths increases with the accelerated migration time.  However, the chloride 
content of the first slice at different accelerated migration times is almost the same.  
The chloride content at any depth will eventually reach the same chloride value as the 
first slice.  The trend of chloride profiles for series C45, C55, and C65 are similar to 
that of C35.  
In the ACMT, chloride ions transport in specimen under an applied electrical 
potential. The non-steady-state chloride migration coefficient, , obtained from 
ACMT in non-steady state can be calculated as (Tang, 1996):

2. The chloride profile from the total amount of chloride and the surface chloride 
content 
There is another way to obtain the chloride profile from the total amount of 
chloride and the surface chloride content.  The typical result of a chloride 
content-depth curve in non-steady state after the end of ACMT is provided in Fig. 6.  
The total amount of chloride is determined by integrating the chloride-depth curve (in 
Fig. 6) and calculated by:

where  is the time-dependent total electrical current and  is the elapsed time. 
The charge passed obtained from the ACMT at four different accelerated migration 
times for all series are listed in Table 6.  
)(tI t
The evolution of the total amount of chloride (in Table 6) and the charge passed as 
a function of the accelerated time for all mixes are presented in Fig. 7 (a) and Fig. 7(b). 
Both the total amount of chloride and the charge passed increase with the increasing 
accelerated time. It can be realized from Fig. 7 that there a relationship exists between 
the total amount of chloride ( ) and the charge passed (Q ) in the non-steady state.  m
 The transference number of an ion in a given electrolyte solution is the fraction of 
the total electrical current carried in the solution by that ion (Andrade, 1993). Every 
specie in the electrolyte has a transference number, , which must always be positive 
and between zero and one. According to the definition, the chloride transference number 
( ) can be calculated by the following equation as

total amount of chloride and the charge passed is statistically derived as

where  is in %, and  is in Coulomb. The correlation coefficient m Q R 2  for the 
model [Eq. (16)] is 0.983, which shows a fairly good linearity between the charge 
passed and the total amount of chloride. Comparing the linear regression results with Eq. 
(15), it indicates that the chloride transference number ( t ) is not significantly different 
in this study. It appears that the total amount of chloride can be determined from the 
measurement of the charge passed.

Since the surface chloride content is not easy to determine, a comparison of surface 
chloride content ( ) in Table 4 and the chloride content at the first slice of 5 mm 
thickness ( ) in Table 3 is shown in Fig. 9. The linear regression is carried out, and the 
best fit is obtained as

C
.081.1 1Cao =              (17) 
From the linear regression analysis of Eq. (17), the surface chloride content is about 
1.081 times higher than the chloride content from the first slice from the exposed 
surface. Although some of the points in Fig. 9 are roughly scattered, the values of  
and  are very close. In this study, Eq. (17) is good enough to obtain the surface 
chloride content from the chloride content at the first slice of about 5 mm thickness.

penetration depth by using by using the modified form ofFick’s second law in Eq. 
(3). 
In order to compare the result of chloride profile from the curve fitting based on 
experimental data (conventional method in section 3.1) and from the rapid method in 
3.4, the chloride profiles of series C35 at different accelerated migration times are 
shown in Fig. 10.  It can be seen that the chloride profile obtained from the rapid 
method (dash line) is very close to the profiles obtained from the conventional method 
(solid line).  The depth at which the chloride content reached 0.05% was read from the 
chloride profile that obtained from the rapid method as shown in Fig. 10. These values 
of C35 at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h accelerated migration times are 0.94 cm, 1.87 cm, 
3.92 cm, and 4.86 cm, respectively.  Comparing the depth obtained from the rapid 
method with that from the conventional method (in Table 5), it can be realized that the 
rapid method can be used to obtain the chloride penetration depth and calculate the 
non-steady state chloride migration coefficient. Although 4 mixtures with different w/b 
ratios were used in this study, the results are only valid for the current binder.  Since 
another binder or different aggregate contents may change the charge passed, further 
work is required to obtain enough data in order to determine the relationship between 
the total amount of chloride and the charge passed.

rapidly using electromigration tests. A numerical approach, named66
TransChlor, was proposed to simulate transport phenomena of var-67
ious substances in concrete [10]. Yang et al. [11] obtained that a68
linear correlation between the non-steady-state migration coefﬁ-69
cients from chloride concentration and electrical current by using70
ACMT.71
The weakest (high porosity) pore structure in concrete is at72
the interface between aggregate and matrix. In normal concrete or73
mortar, the hydrated matrix surrounding the aggregate has differ-74
entmicrostructures resulting from thewater/cement ratio gradient75
developed between aggregate andmatrix [12]. This is called the ITZ76
(interfacial transition zone),which is characterizedby ahigher con-77
centration of calcium hydroxide crystals and an increased porosity78
relative to the matrix paste [13–15]. Based on the mercury intru-79
sion porosimetry (MIP) experimental data and on the analysis of80
a 3D mortar model, the maximum porosity of ITZ is about three81
times higher than the matrix paste [16]. Yang and Su [17] have82
investigated the effect of interfacial transition zone (ITZ) on the83
chloride migration coefﬁcient of cement-based material by the use84
of the accelerated chloride migration test (ACMT). Using the ACMT85
and regression analysis results, the approximate chloride migra-86
tion coefﬁcient of ITZ is approximately 3 times greater than that of87
the matrix for the ITZ thickness is assumed as 20m. In order to88
simulate the percolated ITZ, specimens with cylindrical aggregates89
of the same height as the specimen were used. Comparison with90
the neat mortar, the approximate percolated ITZ migration coefﬁ-91
cient is approximately 27 times, 30 times, and 34 times of the neat92
mortar for w/c of 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55, respectively [18].93
Thepurpose of this study is to investigate the chloridemigration94
of concrete after heating to temperature up to 95 ◦C. The chloride95
migration coefﬁcients (steady-state coefﬁcient and non-steady-96
state migration coefﬁcient) of unheated and heated concrete97
obtained from the accelerated chloridemigration test (ACMT)were98
studied and compared.99
2. Materials and experimental procedures100
2.1. Materials and specimens101
In this investigation, ASTM Type I portland cement, ﬂy ash (equivalent to ASTM102
Type F), and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) were used as binders.103
River sand with a nominal maximum size of 4.75mm was used as ﬁne aggregate104
and crushed limestone with a nominal maximum size of 10mm was used as coarse105
aggregate. Details of the 16 different mix proportions are listed in Table 1. Test106
specimens were marked in such a manner that the ﬁrst letter(s) indicates the type107
of binder, such as C, F (20% replacements of binder with ﬂy ash by weight), S (40%108
replacements of binder with slag by weight), and SF (30% replacements of binder 109
with 9% ﬂy ash and 21% slag by weight). The amounts of coarse and ﬁne aggregates 110
were kept constant as 946kgm−3 and 806kgm−3, respectively. A superplasticizer 111
was also used for concrete containing a low w/b ratio such as 0.35 and 0.45. 112
Concrete cylinders, each 100mm in diameter and 200mm in height, were cast 113
for each of the 16 concrete mixes. After the concrete cylinders were taken out of the 114
molds, they were cured in water at 23 ◦C for 90 days. After 90 days of water curing, 115
half of the specimens (control specimens) were left at ambient temperature for 90 116
days and the other half of specimens (heated specimens) were heated in an electric 117
furnace up to 95 ◦C for 90 days. The heating rate was about 5 ◦C/min measured in 118
the oven. After reaching the target temperature of 95 ◦C, the specimens were stored 119
in the oven for 90 days. Before testing, the heated specimens were allowed to cool 120
naturally to room temperature. At the age of 180 days after casting, the compressive 121
strengthand the transportproperties of concrete for all specimensweredetermined. 122
Compressive strength tests were carried out on 100mm in diameter and 200mm in 123
height cylinder specimens, and three specimenswere used for eachmixes. The com- 124
pressive strength of concrete obtained according to ASTM C 39 is listed in Table 1. 125
The compressive strength of concrete was the average of the results of three tests 126
samples. 127
Three specimens were used for the accelerated chloride migration test (ACMT). 128
Three specimens of 30±2-mm-thick slices for ACMT were cut from the central por- 129
tion of the cylinders and vacuum saturated according to ASTM C1202. Before the 130
vacuum saturation, the specimens were air dried for 1h, and the lateral surface 131
of the specimens was coated with epoxy. The specimens were then placed in a 132
vacuum desiccative chamber containing a pressure less than 1mmHg for 3h. The 133
specimenswere then immersed into de-aeratedwater at the same vacuumpressure 134
level as before for one more hour. After then, the specimens were taken out from 135
the chamber and kept in de-aerated water for at least 18h before the ACMT testing. 136
2.2. Experimental procedures 137
The electrochemical technique was used to accelerate the migration of chlo- 138
ride ions in concrete to estimate the chloride migration coefﬁcient. The accelerated 139
chloride migration test (ACMT) set-up is the same as the previous studies [19,20]. 140
The specimen was placed between two acrylic cells. One of the cells was ﬁlled with 141
4.5 L of 0.3N NaOH solution and the other with 4.5 L of 3% NaCl solution. The brass 142
meshes (10mm,#20mesh)wereplacedon thesidesof the specimenaselectrodes. 143
The cells were connected with a 24V DC power source, where the NaOH electrode 144
acted as anode and NaCl electrode as cathode. The quantity of chloride ions pass- 145
ing through the specimen in anode cell was measured and determined periodically 146
using potentiometric titration with 0.01N silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. 147
3. Results and discussion 148
3.1. Compressive strength 149
The compressive strength of control specimens (at room tem- 150
perature) and heated specimens (at 95 ◦C temperature) in Table 1 151
was compared. The compressive strengthof heated specimen for all 152
mixes (except for SF45 (19%) and SF55 (24%)) showed a reduction 153
of less than 15%. 154

the universal gas constant, T is absolute temperature (K), and erf−1200
is the inverse of error function.201
The ACMT result of chloride concentration in transition period202
for series C is plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of time, and the results203
of control specimen (at room temperature) and heated specimen204
(at 95 ◦C) are also shown in it. The breakthrough times are signiﬁ-205
cantly reduced under the condition of 95 ◦C temperature, and they206
are reduced to a limited range (3.5–2.4h). For series C, the break-207
through times of heated specimens are approximately 3–9 times208
shorter than that of the control specimens.209
The ACMT result of chloride concentration in transition period210
for series F, S, and SF have the same trend as the series C. It can be211
seen from the result of the breakthrough time in Table 2 that the212
breakthrough times (tb) are signiﬁcantly reduced under the con-213
dition of 95 ◦C temperature, and are shortened compared to the214
series C. For concrete containing mineral admixtures, the break-215
through time of control specimens is longer than the series C with216
the same w/b ratios.217
By using the breakthrough time tb and the specimen thickness218
in Table 2, the non-steady-state migration coefﬁcients (Mn) for219
all specimens are calculated from Eq. (2), and listed in Table 3.220
Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the non-steady-state migra-221
tion coefﬁcient and w/b ratio for all mixes. The results of control222
specimen (at room temperature) and heated specimen (at 95 ◦C)223
are shown in this ﬁgure. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that the224

steady state migration coefﬁcient and w/b ratio for all mixes, and274
the results of control specimen (at room temperature) and heated275
specimen (at 95 ◦C) are also shown in this ﬁgure. The steady state276
migration coefﬁcient of control specimens and heated specimens277
increases with the increase in w/b ratio. The steady state migration278
coefﬁcient for C series is higher than those of other three series279
(S, F, and SF) with the same w/b ratios. For concrete containing280
mineral admixture, the steady state migration coefﬁcients are281
2–2.5×10−12 m2 s−1, 2.7×10−12 m2 s−1, 2.7–3.8×10−12 m2 s−1,282
and 3.9–5.3×10−12 m2 s−1 with the w/b ratios of 0.35, 0.45, 0.55,283
and 0.65, respectively. The steady state migration coefﬁcients of284
heated specimen are signiﬁcantly increased under the condition of285
95 ◦C temperature. The steady state migration coefﬁcient for series286
C, F, S, and SF showed an increase of about 2–3 times, 4–6 times,287
4–6 times, and 4–5 times, respectively, when concrete specimens288
are exposed to 95 ◦C compared to the specimens stored at room289
temperature.290
3.4. Effect of pores connectivity on the chloride migration291
coefﬁcient from temperature292
The transport properties of concrete are inﬂuenced by the pore293
structure (porosity, pore size, and pore connectivity). Noumowe et294
al. [5] studied the pore structure of concrete after heating at differ- 295
ent temperatures with the MIP (mercury intrusion porosimetry). 296
The porosimetry measurements show that for temperature lower 297
than120 ◦C thenormal concreteporosity increasedonly about0.5%, 298
and the pores increase mainly at the pore diameter between 120 299
and 200nm. Poyet [26] studied the pore structure of concrete after 300
heating at 30 ◦C and 80 ◦C and kept at RH=3% with the MIP. The 301
porosities at 30 ◦C and 80 ◦C are 8.12% and 9.59%, respectively. The 302
increased porosity is 1.47%, and the pores increase mainly at the 303
pore diameter 110nm. 304
In order to understand the connectivity of the increased pores 305
around the aggregate, the volume fraction of the layers (VI) around 306
aggregate is estimated and compared with the increased porosity 307
(VP). Three conditions are assumed as following: 308
(1) a uniform layer surrounds every single aggregate, 309
(2) the thickness of the uniform layers is the same as themaximum 310
pore diameter, 311
(3) the pores are gathered along the interface. 312
The volume fraction of the layers can be estimated from the size 313
and the volume fraction of aggregate. If the increased porosity is 314
more than the volume fraction of the layer as shown in Fig. 6(a), 315
the increased pores around aggregate are connected. On the con- 316
trary, if the increasedporosity is less than the volume fractionof the 317
layers, the increased pores around aggregate are isolated as shown 318
in Fig. 6(b). When the shape of aggregate is assumed as spherical, 319
the volume fraction of the layers (VI) is calculated as [17]: 320
VI = Vf
∑
Ri
(ri + h)3 − r3i

, (5) 321
where R is individual retained ratio on i sieve and r is the average 322
radius of aggregate which restrained on i sieve, h is the thickness 323
of the layers, and Vf is the volume fraction of aggregate. 324
In this study, the volume fraction of ﬁne aggregate is 0.333 325
and coarse aggregate is 0.307. The average diameter of ﬁne aggre- 326
gate is about 450m (passing No. 30 sieve and retained on No. 50 327
sieve) and coarse aggregate is about 0.59 cm (passing 3/8′′ sieve and 328
retained on No. 8 sieve). Noumowe et al. [5] and Poyet [26] stud- 329
ied the pore structure of concrete after heating to temperature up 330
to 120 ◦C and 80 ◦C, respectively, with the MIP (mercury intrusion 331
porosimetry). The porosimetry measurements show that for tem- 332
perature up to 120 ◦C the normal concrete porosity increased about 333
0.5% [5], and the temperature up to 80 ◦C the porosity increased 334
about 1.47%. In this study, the chloride migration of concrete was 335
obtained after the specimens heating to temperature up to 95 ◦C. 336
Using Noumowe et al. [5] and Poyet [26] experimental result, the 337
volume fractions of the layers estimated from Eq. (5) are 0.089% 338
and 0.049%, respectively. The increased porosity from Noumowe et 339
Fig. 6. The increased pores around aggregate are connected (a), the increased pores around aggregate are isolated (b).
