2overlapping sections, in which every section consists of two pixels. Then two pixels of every section are
encoded successively according to two basic matrices. When all sections are processed, two non-expanded
sharing images will be constructed. Furthermore, superimposing two sharing images can reveal the secret
image. Experimental results show that the proposed method totally removes the disadvantage of pixel
expansion. However, the constructed sharing images are still meaningless.Most methods transform a gray-
level image into a halftone one, which will limit the applicability of secret sharing technique [17]. In 2005,
Lukac and Plataniotis [17] proposed a new secret sharing method based on bit-level decomposition. The
concept of the method is to decompose an image with B-bit into B bit planes, in which every plane can be
viewed as a binary image. By superimposing B encrypted bit planes, several B-bit sharing images are
constructed. To recover the original image, the similar decomposition process is utilized to decompose B-
bit sharing images first. After that, by performing the decrypting algorithm, the original image can be
revealed without any loss of information. Although the method can totally recover the original image, the
problem of pixel expansion is an unsolved problem.
Based on the above-mentioned discussion, a secret sharing method for color images is proposed in
this paper, in which the concept of random grid, multi-point encoding and bit plane will be introduced into
the proposed method. Furthermore, to simplify the sharing process, the color images will be transformed
to the halftone ones. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The proposed method is described in
Section 2. Experimental results are shown in Section 3. Conclusions are given in Section 4.
2. The proposed method
The method is divided into two phases, including the sharing phase and the reconstruction phase.
2.1 The sharing phase
Step 1: Transform a color secret image and a color cover image to the halftone color images.
Step 2: Decompose the halftone secret images and obtain the images SR, SG and SB of R, G, and B
components respectively.
Step 3: Decompose the halftone cover images and obtain the images CR, CG and CB of R, G, and B
components respectively.
Step 4: Generate three random grids R1, G1, and B1, which consist of random value of 0 or 1.
Step 5: Construct three random grids R2, G2, and B2, by the algorithm of random grid. A constructed
example of random grid R2 is as follows.

1 ;
( , ) 0;
2( , ) 1( , );
2( , ) 1( , );
For i to m
For j to n
If SR i j
R i j R i j
Else
R i j R i j
End
End
End

Step 6: Divide six random grids R1, R2, G1, G2, B1, B2 and cover images CR, CG and CB into non-
overlapping section, in which every section consists of two pixels.
Step 7: Successively take two pixels of every section from the results of Step 6 and construct twelve
sharing images R1CR1, R1CR2, R2CR1, R2CR2, G1CG1, G1CG2, G2CG1, G2CG2, B1CB1,
4(XOR) operation among the sharing images, the original image can be revealed without any loss of
information (Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c) show the results of performing the XOR operation between
two sharing images. Furthermore, the results of performing the XOR operation among three sharing
images are shown as Fig. 3(d)-(f). The experimental result show the original image wouldn’t recover
unless collecting four sharing images
4. Conclusions and furture works
In the paper, a secret sharing method for color image is proposed. To improve the problem of
expanded and meaningless sharing images and lossy reconstruction, the concept of random grid, multi-
point encoding and bit plane is introduced into the proposed method. Furthermore, to simplify the sharing
process, the color images are also transformed to the halftone ones. The experimental results show that the
proposed method owns the following advantages: (1) non-expanded sharing image, (2) meaningful sharing
images, and (3) lossless reconstructed image. In the furture, we will propose the method of smaller sharing
images.
