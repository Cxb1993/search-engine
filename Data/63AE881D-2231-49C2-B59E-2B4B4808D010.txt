Abstract- 
 
We report on the steady state modeling of an experimental methanol fuel reformer for fuel cell applications. The 
fuel reformer consists of an Auto Thermal Reformer (ATR) followed by an Oxygen Removal (OR) reactor, a 
Steam Reformer (SR) and Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor. The effluent from the WGS is fed to a series of three 
Preferential Oxidation (PROX) reactors which reduce the CO concentration to less than 20 ppm. A mathematical 
model of the reformer is developed and selected parameters of the model are fit to experimental data collected 
from a fuel reformer that was designed, built and operated by the Material and Chemical Research Laboratories 
(MCL) of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In order to develop a 
compact and high-performance fuel reformer system, the mathematical model is used to design a reformer that 
has the minimum possible combined volume of the steam reformer and water gas shift reactor. The result is that 
the volume of the optimized reactor units can be reduced by 17.2% without a significant change in the overall 
efficiency.  
 
Keywords: methanol fuel reformer, design

1. Introduction 
As a method of power generation, fuel cells have the potential to provide higher efficiency and therefore also 
reduced emissions compared to internal combustion engines [1]. Fuel cells have been designed that can directly 
oxidize fuels such as methane, methanol, dimethylether, etc. However, the greatest efficiency is achieved when 
elemental hydrogen is oxidized directly at the anode. However, as a fuel, hydrogen is difficult to store and 
transport. Therefore, in recent decades, considerable effort has been made in the design of fuel reforming 
systems that can produce a hydrogen-rich stream from a fuel such as methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether or 
hydrocarbon fuels. A detailed review is given by Song [2]. Further background information is available in [3-4].  
 There are a number of considerations in the design of fuel reforming systems [1]. Carbon monoxide is a 
poison for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, thus if this kind of fuel cell is used, the carbon 
monoxide concentration must be reduced to a very low level, typically less than 100 ppm. For transportation 
applications in particular but for stationary applications as well, it is desirable to make the fuel reforming system 
as small and lightweight as possible. Because many fuel reforming reactions take place at high temperatures, it 
is desirable to employ heat integration in order to improve the efficiency of the reforming process. Finally, it is 
desirable that the fuel reforming system start up and achieve steady state quickly, and respond quickly to 
changes in hydrogen demand. 
 Many fuels have been proposed for reforming to produce hydrogen, including methane, methanol, 
dimethyl ether, ethanol and even gasoline. Among these, methanol has the advantages that it has a relatively 
high hydrogen-carbon ratio, it is a liquid at room temperature, and it can be formed either from natural gas or 
from biomass. A number of authors have studied methanol fuel reforming for fuel cell applications, including 
[5-13]. 
 In this contribution, we report on the steady state modeling and design optimization of a 1.5 kW methanol 
fuel reformer built and operated by the Material and Chemical Research Laboratories (MCL) of the Industrial 
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The fuel reformer consists of feed preheating unit, 
autothermal reformer, oxygen removal reactor, steam reformer, high temperature water gas shift reactor, and 
preferential oxidation reactor.  
 According to a US Department of Energy report [14], the goals for future PEM fuel cell performance and 
power generation per volume of a feed reformer are 75%(LHV) and 2 kW/L by 2015. Reducing the volume of 
fuel reforming systems is an important step toward meeting these goals. Therefore in this work we also develop 
an optimized design with a minimized fuel reformer volume. 
 This manuscript is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss the experimental setup. In Section 3, we 
discuss each reactor unit and the mathematical model that is used to describe it, including the chemical reactions 
that are assumed to take place and the rate equations that describe them. In Section 4, we show experimental 
data from the MCL fuel reformer, and describe how model parameters were adjusted to fit the experimental data 
and the results of the fitting. In Section 5, we show how the mathematical model was used to design an 
optimized process that has the minimum possible combined volume of the steam reformer and water gas shift 
reactor. Finally, in Section 6 we present conclusions. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
2.1 Experimental set-up 
The experimental fuel processor was designed and installed in the facility of MCL of ITRI. The entire fuel 
processor setup is composed of several reactors, heat exchangers, and a pre-heating system (Regenerative 
Thermal Oxidizer, RTO). A conceptual sketch and a detailed schematic diagram of the fuel reformer system are 
shown in Figure 1. The feeds enter the system at room temperature. The methanol, water and air feed flow rates 
can be adjusted by pumps and a blower. The methanol and water mixture first passes through the RTO which 
uses a catalyst to burn residual hydrogen in the fuel cell exhaust gas or off-spec reformate gas to heat the feed 
stream and vaporize the water and methanol.  
  The vapor mixture then passes into the autothermal reformer. The reformer is made of stainless steel 
304 with good heat transfer capability. Monolith catalyst carrier is placed inside the reformer and the catalyst is 
coated on a ceramic support. The catalyst used here is a Pt /CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst developed by MCL of ITRI. 
Adding Pt on the catalyst surface increases the thermal resistance of the catalyst. 
 The hot reformer effluent is cooled down using a heat exchanger and direct water injection before entering 
the oxygen removal reactor. The purpose of the oxygen removal reactor is to remove the oxygen from the outlet 
stream of the autothermal reformer, because oxygen will poison the commercial Cu-ZnO/Al2O3 (MDC-3) 
catalyst in the steam reformer. 
 After passing through the oxygen removal reactor, the reformed fuel gas enters the steam reformer reactor. 
Following the steam reformer is the water gas shift reactor. Water injection between these two reactors is 
employed to cool the fuel gas. The operating temperature of the water gas shift reactor is 310 °C for HTS and 
Pt/mixed-oxide catalyst developed by MCL of ITRI is coated on honeycomb catalyst carriers in HTS.

 Cooling between reactor units is accomplished either by heat exchange with cooling water or direct cold 
water injection. Where direct injection of water was employed, the following energy balance is used to calculate 
the outlet temperature:

Where the term on the left hand side represents the temperature change of the hydrogen-rich gas stream and the 
right hand side represents the temperature increase and vaporization of the injected water. 
 
4. Experimental Data and Parameter Fitting 
The fuel reformer was operated at steady state with the feed conditions given in Table 3. The temperature and 
composition of the gas stream exiting each reactor was measured. Table 4 shows the steady-state inlet and outlet 
temperature and outlet composition for each reactor unit. In order to match the experimental data to the 
mathematical model, certain model parameters were adjusted iteratively according to the following procedure:  
(1) Initial values are supplied for the parameters U and kcond and the parameter group (hS). 
(2) Adjust certain kinetic parameters in order to match the steady-state reactor effluent compositions as 
closely as possible. 
(3) Using the values of the kinetic parameters from (2), calculate the temperature at the reactor effluent and 
compare with the experimental results. If there is significant deviation, return to (1) and adjust the 
parameters U and kcond and the parameter group (hS). If there is no significant deviation, proceed to (4). 
(4) Adjust capacity parameters ερg, ερgCp,s, (1-ε)ρsCp,s in order to match the dynamic response of the 
process. If a match is possible, then the process parameters have been appropriately identified. If not, 
return to (1) and adjust U and kcond and the parameter group (hS). 
 
 Table 5 shows the values of the physical property parameters that were identified by this procedure. 
Although this paper discusses only a steady-state process model, in step (4) some of the parameters of the 
steady-state model were determined by matching the dynamic response of the process with a dynamic model. 
Appendix A gives additional details about the procedure that was used. If a satisfactory match between the 
calculated and experimentally determined trajectories was not achieved, then the numerical values of the 
physical property parameters were again adjusted and the procedure repeated. Table 6 shows the values of the 
capacity parameters that were identified using dynamic data.  
 Figures 3-5 show the steady state temperature and composition profiles in the reactor as suggested by the 
mathematical model, along with the experimental data points. Figure 3 shows the temperature profile, Figure 4 
shows the mole fraction of methanol (left axis) and oxygen (right axis) on logarithmic scales, and Figure 5 
shows the composition of CO2 and H2 (left axis, linear scale) and CO (right axis, logarithmic scale). Along the 
top of each figure are labels which identify each reactor in the process. Note that as shown in Figure 1 there is 
water injection after the oxygen removal and steam reforming reactors, and inter-stage cooling and oxygen 
injection before each of the PROX reactors.  
 In the autothermal reactor, the temperature rises rapidly as the highly exothermic oxidation reaction (ROX) 
occurs first, and then decreases as the endothermic molecular decomposition reaction (RMD) and reverse water 
gas shift reaction (RW) proceed. Some thermal energy is also lost to the environment. In the ATR, the 
concentration of methanol and oxygen drop rapidly (Fig. 4), while the concentration of CO2, H2 and CO rapidly 
rise (Fig. 5), consistent with the occurrence of all three reactions. 
 In the oxygen removal reactor, the temperature rises due to the highly exothermal oxidation reaction 
(Fig. 3), while the concentration of oxygen rapidly drops almost to zero (Fig. 4). This is necessary because
oxygen present at this point in the gas stream will poison the copper catalyst in the water gas shift reactor. 
 any 
 In the steam reforming and water gas shift reactors, the temperature rises gradually (Fig. 3). The 
concentrations of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gradually rise, while the concentration of CO gradually falls, 
consistent with the occurrence of the water gas shift reaction (Figs. 4-5). 
 Before each of the PROX reactors, the gas stream is cooled in a heat exchanger and oxygen is injected 
into the reactor. The temperature rises in the reactor because the oxidation reactions are exothermic. Because 
concentrations are expressed on a mole fraction basis, there are discontinuities in the mole fraction of all species 
when air is injected into the system, because the air injection increases the total number of moles of gas in the 
stream. In each PROX reactor, the concentration of CO decreases and the concentration of CO2 increases, while 
there is a very slight decrease in the hydrogen concentration.  
 
5. Design Optimization 
One key consideration in the design of fuel reformers, particularly for transportation applications, is the weight 
and volume of the reformer components. Therefore, after a mathematical model of the process was developed, a 
design optimization was conducted, with the objective of minimizing the combined volume of the fuel reformer 
reactor units. Table 2 shows the volume of each reactor unit. The largest contributions to the total volume come 
 3
adapting kinetic expressions for the reactions taken from the literature. Certain physical property parameters, 
kinetic parameters, and capacity parameters were adjusted in order to match available experimental data. The 
model shows good agreement with the experimental data. The model was also used to develop an optimized 
design in which the volume of the reactor units is minimized.

Abstract- 
 
A current-voltage (I-V) curve, also known as a polarization curve, is generally used to express the characteristics 
of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. The behavior of a PEM fuel cell is highly nonlinear 
and it is important to incorporate process nonlinearity for control system design and process optimization. 
Therefore, it is essential to generate the I-V curve from the model as the operating condition changes. 
 A first principle one-dimensional water and thermal management model is developed to generate the I-V curve. 
The model considers the effects of: water transport across the membrane, activation overpotential, ohmic 
overpotential, concentration overpotential, pressure drops, and current density distribution along the channel of 
a PEM fuel cell. Design and modeling parametersare obtained via regression from four sets of experimental data. 
They are further validated as operating conditions (e.g., fuel cell temperature, anode pressure, cathode pressure, 
hydrogen stoichiometric ratio, air stoichiometric ratio, hydrogen humidification temperature, and air 
humidification temperature) change. A sensitivity analysis example is used to illustrate the usefulness of the 
predictive model. 
 
Keywords: proton exchange membrane fuel cell, I-V curve, modeling, optimization
1. Introduction 
A  PEM fuel cell is an electrochemical energy converter where no combustion occurs during the reaction. 
In order to design and optimize the PEM fuel cell, it is very important to determine the polarization curve which 
shows the performance characteristics of the fuel cell. As soon as the I-V curve is determined, other information 
about the fuel cell becomes obtainable, such as power output and efficiency which can be used as a design and 
control indicator. Appropriate water and thermal management plays a crucial role in the fuel cell operation. This 
is because too much water will cause flooding and too little water will cause the membrane dry out, both 
conditions will lead to cell operation failure. To maintain the operating cell temperature, heat as a by-product 
generated by the electrochemical reaction must be controlled by a cooling system otherwise excessive heat will 
also result in cell failure. 
Over the last few years, many studies on modeling a PEM fuel cell have been developed. In 
one-dimensional models, [1] were the first to consider and analyze water transport mechanism within the 
membrane and its effect on the cell performance. Moreover, various factors that could reduce the cell 
performance have been investigated in [2-5]. In particular, Ji and Van Nguyen [3] proposed the 
along-the-channel model to explore effects of design and operating parameters. Water and thermal management 
of a PEM fuel cell using two-dimensional models have been studied in [6-10]. More recently, a comprehensive 
three-dimensional model of transport phenomena in a PEM fuel cell has been developed and implemented into a 
commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package in [11-13]. The effect of temperature has been 
incorporated in three-dimensional and steady-state model in [14-15]. 
The objective of this work is to find a simplest possible predictive model for PEM fuel cell behavior 
description under various operating conditions. First, a one-dimensional water and thermal management model 
[3] has been adopted to generate the I-V curve. Instead of modeling a single operating temperature, the 
parameters have been adjusted to describe fuel cell behavior at different operating conditions. Then, two 
modeling parameters, (activation energy from [6] and diffusion layer thickness from [16]), two design 
parameters from [1], (open circuit voltage and membrane thickness), are obtained by minimizing the square 
errors between experiments and predictions for four sets of experimental data. Next, the model is further 
validated experimentally under various operating conditions. Finally, the prediction capability of the model is 
illustrated via sensitivity analyses. The effects of these parameters, such as the cell temperatures, the reactant 
flow rates, the humidity of the reactant gases and the pressures at the anode and cathode on the cell performance 
have been investigated to describe fuel cell performance and then to determine the optimum operating 
conditions. 
 
2. Experimental 
The experiments on a single fuel cell were performed at the Industrial Technology Research Institute/Energy 
and Environment Research Laboratory (ITRI/EEL) facility in Hsin Chu. An experimental single fuel cell is 
composed of several components: end plates, current connector plates, membrane electrode assembly (MEA), 
gas diffusion layer, flow field plate, locating pins, and gas feed connection. The assembled experimental device 
of a PEM fuel cell is 100 mm x 100 mm. A 100 mm x 100 mm bipolar plate is made of carbon graphite with two 
channels, each 1 mm wide, 1 mm deep and a total of 672 mm in length. There is 1 mm shoulder between the 
two channels to prevent deformation of the membrane electrode assembly. The channels’ configurations are 
serpentine. The active area of the MEA provided by Gore-Tex Inc. using PRIMEATM 5621 is 50 mm x 50 mm.  
The temperature of the cell is controlled by an electrical heating device as shown in Fig. 1. Pure hydrogen as a 
fuel is fed to the anode side and air as an oxidant is fed to the cathode side. The stoichiometric ratios (which are 
the molar ratios between the actual flow rate of a reactant and the theoretical flow rate according to reaction 
stoichiometry) of these two flow rates are kept constant. The flow rates of the reactant gases are controlled by 
mass flow controllers. Both gas flows go through humidifiers before entering the PEM fuel cell and the water 
vapor content in the reactant gases are adjusted and controlled by adjusting the humidifier temperature via 
corresponding temperature controllers. The PEM fuel cell consists of two gas channels separated by the MEA. 
On the surface of the anode and cathode sides of the MEA, the electrochemical reaction takes place. The flow 
rates of the outlet gases are modulated by backpressure regulators to keep the pressure along the channels fixed. 
Then power output is produced and the electronic load bank is used to measure the power to adjust the input 
flow rates, water and heat are by-products. During the experiments, the cell voltage is set to a constant value for 
each operating condition, the feed flow rates are changed to match the required power level. Thus, I-V curves at 
different operating temperatures were generated as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
3. Reactor Models  
With the experimental I-V curve, a first principle model can be constructed for operation. Here, a 
one-dimensional water and thermal management model of [3] is used for behavior description.

where Iavg is the averaged current density and L is the channel length; 
Due to the cell temperature uniformity within a PEM fuel cell, energy balance equations are negligible in this 
system. Table 1 summarizes the aforementioned equation notations used in this model. 
 
4. Results and Discussions 
4.1 Regression and validation 
At the modeling stage, a first principle model has been constructed and then modeling and design parameters 
can be identified via regression from the experimental data. First of all, the optimization equation with n data 
sets and r experimental data points per experimental condition can be formulated as:

= =
= − ,    ∈∑∑                            (9) 
In this work, four sets of experimental data with the cell operating at temperatures of 50 oC, 60 oC, 70 oC, and 
80 oC are used for the regression, and an optimization run takes about 2 minutes using IMSL (DBCONF) in 
FORTRAN. The two design parameters, open circuit potential (Voc ) and membrane thickness (tm ), and the two 
modeling parameters, activation energy ( Ea) and diffusion layer thickness (δ ), are obtained by minimizing the 
square errors between data and predicted values. The results are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 4 shows that 
reasonably good predictions can be obtained. However, one of the modeling parameters, diffusion layer 
thickness, which is used to describe the effect of concentration overpotential is not clearly identified. It is 
reasonable to correlate the oxygen molar flow rate with the diffusion layer thickness due to the mass transport 
phenomena. Fig. 5 clarifies a linear relationship between the average oxygen molar flow rate and the diffusion 
layer thickness for an improved fitting of the experimental data. The averaged oxygen molar flow rate is 
computed for a specific I-V curve for cell voltage between 0.6 V and 0.7 V. The diffusion layer thickness is an 
explicit function of average oxygen molar flow.

In the subsequent computation, the diffusion layer thickness is adjusted according to Eq. (11) as the operating 
condition changes. Once the I-V curve becomes available, one can generate the corresponding current density 
and power curve, Fig. 6 (for I-P curve for a given temperature), which is useful for process operation as the 
power demand changes. 
Next, the experimental data on different anode/cathode pressures, feed stoichiometric ratios, and humidification 
temperatures are tested on this predictive model while keeping the other operating variables at nominal values. 
As can be seen in Fig. 7, the predictive model captures the process trends well for various operating conditions. 
It should also be emphasized here that the predictive model provides reasonably good behavior without any 
adjustable parameter. 
 
4.2 Sensitivity analysis 
Once the steady-state model is available, it is possible to predict the behavior of a single PEM fuel cell. At the 
application level, operating at the peak power (maximum in Fig. 6) should be avoided because it results in sign 
reversal as the current density varies. In terms of process control, this will lead to instability if an integral action 
is employed in the controller. Therefore, a common practice is to set the operating cell potential to the range of 
0.6 V - 0.7 V [18-19]. It is obvious that the selected cell potential depends on the desired fuel cell size and 
power demand for various applications. Without loss of generality, we simply set the nominal operating point to 
0.65 V as shown in Fig. 8. At the operating level, the power output is often adjusted as the load varies. Thus, it is 
important to identify dominant process variables [20] to meet the load demand via feedback control. It is well 
known that the performance of the PEM fuel cell is influenced by many operating variables such as: the fuel cell 
temperature, the stoichiometric ratios of the reactants, the anode and cathode pressure, and the humidification 
temperatures of the reactants at the anode and cathode. In this section, the effects of these variables on the I-V 
curve and consequently the power output will be explored. All the changes are expressed in terms of percentage 
of the full operating range. The full range (transmitter span) for the cell temperature is 50 oC (from 30 oC to 80 
oC), for the stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen and air it is 2.5 X (from 1 X to 3.5 X), for the anode and cathode 
pressure it is 1.36 atm (from 1 atm to 2.36 atm), and for the humidification temperature it is 60 oC (from 25 oC 
to 85 oC). 
4.2.1 The fuel cell temperature 
Fig. 9 shows how power output varies due to changes of ±20% in the cell temperatures compared with the base 
case at a fixed cell potential of 0.65 V. A 20% increase in the cell temperature leads to an 8% increase in the 
 15
P and I) may change sign. Thus, a reasonable description of the I-V curves at different operating conditions is 
helpful to devise gain-schedule control, and, more importantly, to avoid possible unstable operation. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study an experimental setup was constructed and experiments were performed on a single PEM fuel cell 
at the ITRI Hsinchu facility. A first principle one-dimensional model is constructed and a solution procedure is 
formulated. Based on the temperature experimental data, design and modeling parameters are identified via 
constraint optimization. The predictive model gives reasonably good behavior description as operating 
conditions (e.g., fuel cell temperature, anode pressure, cathode pressure, hydrogen stoichiometric ratio, air 
stoichiometric ratio, hydrogen humidification temperature, and air humidification temperature) change. Next, 
the prediction capability of the model is illustrated via sensitivity analyses. The simulation results show that the 
following process variables, fuel cell temperature, cathode pressure, air feed stoichiometric ratio, and anode 
humidification temperature, are effective in changing the I-V curves and, subsequently, power output.

Abstract- 
 
NaBH4 hydrolysis for on-board hydrogen generation has received much attention recently due to its higher 
theoretical energy capacity and zero emissions. In this work, three different operating modes (adiabatic, 
isothermal, Partially-insulated) of a continuous hydrogen generation system using the NaBH4 hydrolysis 
reaction are explored. Partially-insulated operation is recommended for this system since it has a higher outlet 
temperature and lower temperature distribution in reactor, which both mitigate the NaBO2 precipitation problem 
so that a larger energy density can be achieved. A novel reactor design is proposed to overcome the effects of 
gas generation and multiphase flow from the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction. With a pinhole membrane set in the 
middle of reactor tube to provide gas and liquid channels respectively, the multi-phase flow problem is reduced 
and energy capacity increased since a separator is not needed for gas-liquid separation. Next, two control 
structures are developed and both give reasonable dynamic results. The on-supply structure gives fast response 
while the on-demand structure provides a simple control loop to adjust hydrogen generation directly. After 
control policies are designed, a cold start-up strategy is developed using a pulse plus step function feed input 
and reserved hydrogen from previous reaction to give rapid and sufficient hydrogen gas to supply a PEM fuel 
cell. 
 
Keywords:  hydrogen storage, process design, modeling, control, start-up
1. Introduction 
Hydrogen gas is considered to be a promising alternative to fossil fuels since it has a higher heating value and 
zero emissions, which may reduce global warming. However, the price of hydrogen is still too high to compete 
with traditional fossil fuels due to its high cost in transportation and storage. For example, the price for 
hydrogen produced by reforming hydrocarbons is 2 $/kg [1] while the cost for transporting is 2~4$/kg depend 
on the distance, which means total price is 3~5 $/kg while the price of oil is 2 $/kg. Therefore, efficient and 
economic storage technology is the key to commercializing hydrogen energy. 
With regard to technology for hydrogen storage, hydrogen can either be stored as a compressed gas, as liquid or 
in hydrogen storage materials. However, there are still problems to be solved for all of these storage methods. 
For instance, high pressure tanks have safety problems and low volumetric storage capacity. Liquefying 
hydrogen for storage consumes substantial energy. Metal chemical hydrides have good volumetric capacity but 
worse gravity capacity.  
Recently, chemical hydride hydrolysis reactions to produce hydrogen have attracted considerable attention due 
to the high hydrogen content and the ease of controlling hydrogen generation by the catalyzed reaction. Table 1 
2 [2] shows different kinds of chemical hydride hydrolysis reactions. Among them, sodium borohydride has the 
highest theoretical hydrogen storage as defined in Eq. (1 1).

 (1 1) 
Hydrogen gas generated from NaBH4 solutions can be used directly in internal combustion engines or in Proton 
Exchange Membrane fuel cells (PEM) with the following advantages [3]: 
1. NaBH4 solutions are stable and nonflammable under normal conditions. 
2. Because the hydrolysis reaction is initiated by a catalyst, H2 generation can be easily controlled. 
3. Byproduct NaBO2 is environmentally safe and recyclable to reactant NaBH4. 
4. Volumetric and gravimetric H2 storage efficiencies are high. 
5. The hydrolysis reaction can be initiated at room temperature. 
6. Because the hydrolysis reaction is highly exothermic, the generated H2 contains water vapor that will 
increase PEM fuel cell performance since prehumidified H2 is needed in PEM fuel cells. 
In addition to advantages above, it has been reported [4] that hydrogen storage using NaBH4 for PEM fuel 
cell has a higher energy density compared with Li-ion batteries. Table 1-1 shows that the 
NaBH4 system has energy density of 720 wh/kg while Li-ion batteries have energy density of 
170 wh/kg. 
1.2. Literature survey 
There have been many studies on hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. Different 
sodium borohydride preparations are used in these investigations which are mainly experimental. They are 
NaBH4 aqueous solution, solid NaBH4 reacting with liquid water, solid NaBH4 reacting with water vapor and 
NaBH4 gel. The following section will review the literature on using different types of NaBH¬4 reactant and 
remark on the energy density they achieved. 
1.2.1. NaBH4 aqueous solution 
In an early contribution, Amendola et al. [5] use sodium borohydride solution and achieved a hydrogen storage 
density 4.2wt% of using Ru catalyst. Zhang et al. [6] claimed 3.1wt% hydrogen storage while proposing a 
steady-state multi-component and multi-phase flow reactor model, which is only report in the open literature 
involving a hydrogen generator reactor model. The highest gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity ever reported 
for NaBH4 aqueous solution is Dong et al. [7], they reported 6.7wt% using NixB catalyst. 
1.2.2. Solid NaBH4 reacts with liquid water 
To further increase the energy density of the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction system, some researchers try to use 
solid NaBH4 to react with water to reduce the water needed to form NaBH4 solution. Kojima et al. [8] used 
solid NaBH4 reacting with liquid water to reach 9.0wt% hydrogen storage and Liu et al. [9] use the same 
method to achieve the result of 6.56wt%. Gislon et al. [10] obtain 6.5wt% capacity by designing different 
reactor layouts and geometries to control production of hydrogen. 
1.2.3. Solid NaBH4 reacts with water vapor 
Marrero-Alfonso et al. [11-12] used water vapor to initial the hydrolysis reaction while adding liquid promoters 
in steam hydrolysis reaction. Although there is no mention of hydrogen storage capacity reported in their studies, 
they confirm the feasibility of water vapor reacting with solid NaBH4 
1.2.4. NaBH4 gel 
In addition to the solid and liquid type of NaBH4, Liu et al. [13] propose an alkaline NaBH4 gel whose 
advantages include that the hydrogen generation rate from the alkaline NaBH4 gel is higher and fewer 
impurities are generated from NaBH4 gel. However, the NaBH4 gel will lose its function as a hydrogen or 
energy carrier when exposed to air.

2.3.3. Kinetic model 
The Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model is employed in this work because it is widely used to describe 
heterogenously catalyzed reaction. Furthermore; one study [18] indicates that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
kinetic model gives best description for the NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction. The kinetic model is:

2.4. Process constraints 
An important issue in the NaBH4 hydrolysis reactor is the solubility constraint of NaBO2. As can be seen from 
Eq. (2 1), NaBO2 is produced after the hydrolysis of NaBH4. NaBO2 will exceed its solubility limit and 
precipitate from the solution if there is not enough liquid water. NaBO2 crystals may not only block the active 
sites of catalyst and affect subsequent H2 generation rates but also block fluid flow in the PFR. Furthermore; the 
NaBO2 crystals precipitate as sodium metaborate dehydrate (NaBO2·2H2O) and sodium metaborate 
tetrahydrate (NaBO2·4H2O) [12], which will consume extra liquid water resulting in more water needed at inlet 
of reactor. Therefore, NaBO2 precipitation must be prevented by proper process design. Fig. 2 2 shows that the 
maximum concentration of NaBH4 and NaBO2 is linear function of temperature, which can be expressed as 
follows [20]: 
44 2 NaBH ,Max
Max. concentration of NaBH  (mol/mol H O) = S = 1.25 0.005T− +   (2-17)

Where  is the solution temperature and the unit is K. T
2.5. Isothermal operation 
2.5.1. Steady-state component profile 
Three design variables are considered in the hydrogen generator with isothermal operation. They are feed ratio 
(FR= FH2O,0 /FNaBH4,0 , molar ratio of inlet liquid water over NaBH4), temperature in reactor (THS) and 
total pressure in reactor (Pt). In the initial condition with feed ratio 12, reactor temperature equal to 20°C and

by adjusting the feed ratio (FR) and inlet temperature (Tin). It can be formulated as: 
in this case. 
2.6.2. Operability analysis 
As for the isothermal operation, we conduct an operability analysis for the adiabatic case. As can be seen in Fig
2 11, the outlet temperature of the reactor changes by only 0.03 °C with different inlet temperature. T
the maximum concentration of NaBO2 is almost constant so that the tolerance of NaBO2 decreases 
monotonically with increasing inlet temperature. Fig. 2 13 shows the tolerance of NaBO2 for different FR and 
different inlet temperature. The tolerance of NaBO2 and operable zone of Tin become narrower with a decrease 
in FR. The difference compared with isothermal operation is that the largest to
in for the smallest Tin for all FR due to its lower 
2.6.3. Optimization of operating variables 
After operability analysis, we try to optimize the same case considered in isothermal section, a 50W power 
demand for 9-hr laptop usage as shown in Fig. 2 7. The objective is to maximize the h

The optimal values of the operating variable are FR=11.7 and Tin=20°C as shown in Fig. 2 14, and the 
corresponding hydrogen storage density is 3.21wt%. The optimal point is located at in the smallest Tin because 
a smaller amount of water vapor is generated which causes a higher tolerance of NaBO2 as illustrated in Fig. 2

2.6.4. Summary of adiabatic operation 
The maximum solubility of NaBO2 at the exit of reactor increases when higher inlet temperature is made. 
However, the tolerance of NaBO2 decreases monotonically with an increase in inlet temperature.  Due to the 
solubility constraint of NaBO2, the optimal inlet temperature is at the minimal inlet temperature which is 20°C.

2.7. Hints from analysis of isotherm
2.7.1. Partially-insulated operation 
Under same inlet temperature (ie.20°C), adiabatic operation has higher temperature distribution in reactor than 
isothermal one as illustrated in Fig. 2 16. The higher temperature throughout the reactor results in larger w
vapor evaporation which is not preferred. On the other hand, the higher outlet temperature (near 90°C) is 
favored for increasing maximum concentration of NaBO2. From the temperature profiles and operability 
analysis in section 2.5 and 2.6, it seems that partially-insulated operation, which may provide lower temperature 
distribution in the reactor tube and higher outlet temperatu
problem and improve performance as shown in Fig. 2 17.

2.7.5. Summary of partially-insulated operation 
From the same case shown in Fig. 2 7 for three operations (isothermal, adiabatic and partially-insulated), the 
partially-insulated operation has the highest hydrogen storage as expected. The reason for this is that it has a 
higher outlet temperature than the isothermal case and a lower temperature distribution than adiabatic ca
partially-insulated system benefits from mitigating the N
three operations. Furtherm

temperature for people using this energy supply device.

In this chapter, we discuss the problem in NaBH4 hydrolysis reactors, which is a multi-component and 
multi-phase flow with high ratio of gas volume to liquid volume. The flow stream with high mixing of gas and 
liquid will cause some undesired phenomena such as low catalyst effic

In Chapter 2, we completed the optimization for adiabatic operation for the case of supplying 50W of power fo

simulation. Fig. 4 6 shows the result of +20% setpoint change using the on-supply control structure. 
Unfortunately, the concentration of NaBO2 exceeds the solubility limitation so that precipitation occurs. Th

Therefore, we modify the optimal condition to prevent precipitation as described in the following section

5.3.3. Dynamic results in start-up stage 
5.3.3.1. Feed input: first order 
Fig. 5 3 shows the dynamic response for a first order input with a time constant equals to 10. As can been seen
hydrogen, NaBO2 and water vapor outlet flow r
t  
the hydrolysis reaction is initiated when fuel contacts catalyst. The reactor outlet temperature increases rapid
due to the large heat of reaction. The rise time to full flow of the hydrogen gas production rate for this case is 
about 70 sec and NaBO2¬ does not crystallize. 
In order to reduce the start-up time, it may be desirable to introduce
means us g a smaller time constant for the first order
different time constants. For the different time constant of first order function we tried, the smallest start-up t
achieved is 60 sec in the case where the time constant is 1 second. 
5.3.3.2. Feed input: pulse plus step function 
Fig. 5 5 shows the dynamic response for a pulse plus step function feed input. The height of the pulse is 2.
times the nominal value of liquid volumetric flow rat
which is shorter than first order input case. The reason for this is that a larger amount of reactant enters the 
reactor in a smaller time compared to the first order case. Thus, a shorter rise time in hydrogen dynamic 
response is achieved using pulse plus step function. 
To further decrease the start-u
th
achieved for a height of pulse which is 3.0 times the nominal value 
precipitation is also avoided. 
 
5.3.4. Aid with reservation of hydrogen from previous reaction 
Start-up time can be further reduced by using pulse plus step function instead of
different cases of feed input we tried, the fastest start-up time achieved is 20 sec, which is still less than the 
target of 5~15 sec set by DOE. However, if we use the hydrogen remaining in the reactor from previous reac
