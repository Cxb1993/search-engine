Gear is a precision machine element. Design, manufacture and 
inspection of gears are under stringent size control to meet the 
requirement of high quality. This research focuses on the part of 
inspection, and investigates the measuring technique for gears. The 
limitation of span measurement and over-balls measurement is 
discussed. It is known that the tooth shape parameters won’t be shown 
in the above two measurements. Improvement will be made, and the 
technique modified is able to measure the tooth shape parameters. 
The proposed technique is based on the over-balls measurement. 
Different sizes of balls are used, and the geometric relationship 
between the gear and the balls is built. Taking the gear as a whole, the 
least square error method are used, and the equation derived can be 
used to solve the tooth shape parameters, such pressure angel and 
profile shifted factor. In additions, span measurement and over-balls 
measurement are no longer applicable for gears with modules under 
1mm or less. In view of this problem, the goal of this research is to 
extend this technique to the image analysis for the determination of 
tooth shape parameters of gears with modules under several tenths 
millimeter.

Fig. 1 Involute profile of a spur gear.
MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION
Using the gearing theory developed by Litvin [12], the
profile equations for the spur and helical gears with a nonzero
profile-shifted factor can be derived as follows:
(i) Spur gear
As shown in Fig. 1, TS is the involute part of the gear
profile. The position vector for a point on TS can be written
as

When generating the gear with a rack, cand  are the
pressure angle rack and the angular displacement of the gear
blank, respectively, and N , m and X are the tooth number,
module and profile-shifted factor of the gear, respectively.
Using a micrometer to manipulate the over-balls
measurement, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the distance D ,
which is a function of the rack pressure angle, the module and
the profile-shifted factor of the gear, can be expressed as2 Copyright © 2005 by ASME

The geometric relationship between the gear and the steel

C the steel ball center, and G the contact point between the
gear and the steel ball. Let d , mR , and MR be the diameter
of the steel ball, the distance from the gear center to the ball
center, and the longest distance from the gear center to the steel

Figs. 5 and 6 show the over-balls measurement of even-
tooth-number and odd-tooth-number gears, respectively. In the
derivations below, the subscripts e and o denote even-
tooth-number and odd-tooth-number gears, respectively, while
subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the first and second measurements,
respectively.
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the value of MR differs
between odd-tooth-number and even-tooth-number gears. For
an even-tooth-number gear, MR is written as

Using the data presented in Tables 2 and 3, the tooth
parameters are calculated using the proposed computational
algorithm. The results are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 for the
spur gear and helical gear, respectively. In these tables, Data I,

measurement procedure. Data I corresponds to the maximum
ball size, Data II to the minimum ball size, and Data III to an
intermediate ball size. The tooth number parameter for the spur8 Copyright © 2005 by ASME

Table 4 shows that the parameter values have good
precision and accuracy for the spur gear. For example, the
profile-shifted factor is designed to be 0.493, and the maximum
deviation of the measured values from this design value is
found to be 0.022 (=0.493-0.471), equivalent to 4.4% of 0.493.
Furthermore, the values obtained by span calculation and by
span measurement, respectively, are very close, as shown in
row M M . Meanwhile, for the helical gear, Table 5 shows
that the data has good precision, but poor accuracy. For
example, the profile-shifted factor is designed to be 0.900, and

where J1  and J2  are the polar moments of inertia of 
gears 1 and 2, respectively. Along the line of action, the 
displacements of gears 1, 2 are 
δ θ1 1 1= Rb  (3) δ θ2 2 2= Rb  (4) 
Therefore, the relative displacement between the two 
gears can be written as:

Consider that 
Aε  and ε B  are the composite profile 
deviations at the mating points A and B. The dynamic 
loads at contact points A and B can be calculated using the 
following: 
P KA A r A  ( )= −δ ε  (8) 
P KB B r B  ( )= −δ ε  (9) 
It is assumed that the dynamic alternation of output torque

where P0  is the reference load or the steady load, 
P T Rb0 1 1=  / . The effect of the damping force is 
incorporated into the dynamic load calculation by 
introducing a viscous damping force 2ζ ω δn r . Under 
this assumption, the converted equation of motion can be 
rewritten as: 
 δ ζ ω δ ω δ ξr n r n r r+ + =2 2  (12) 
The magnitude of damping ratio ζ  depends upon the 
lubrication film between the contacting teeth, and a value 
between 0.1 and 0.2 suggested by Hirano [23] and 
Ishikawa [24], for obtaining the correlation between their 
analytical and experimental results. In this study, however, 
a constant value of 0.17 for the damping ratio ζ , as 
proposed by Arikan [20], was used for analysis. 
The transmitted dynamic torque Tr , introduced by the 
dynamic loads PA  and PB  on gear 2, can be 
approximated as 
T P P Rr A B b= +( ) 2  (13) 
 
III. Parameters for the Dynamic Equation 
A. Position dependent mesh stiffness 
The mesh stiffness between an engaged gear pair consists 
of two parts; one associated with the local Hertzian 
deformation and the other associated with the tooth 
bending deflection. The unit width Hertzian stiffness Kh  
resulting from the tooth surface contact was first 
approximated by Yang [18] as: 
2/ 4 (1 )hK Eπ ν⎡ ⎤= −⎣ ⎦  (14) 
where E  is Young's module and ν  is the Poisson's ratio. 
It was noticed that the unit width Hertzian stiffness is 
related only to the gear material, and remains constant 
along the path of contact. 
Based upon the finite element analysis results, an equation 
for the calculation of single tooth bending stiffness for the 
addendum modified involute gear was proposed by Yang 
and Kuang [25]. The unit width stiffness K ri ( )   for a 
single tooth i at a loading position r can be approximated 
using the following equation:

The module m and the face width F in Eq. (26) are all 
measured in meters. The density ρ  and the inertia J are 
measured in ( kg / m3 ) and ( kg m 2⋅ ). 
 
D. Bending stress 
According Kuang and Yang [25], the bending stress at the 
contact points can be express as 
b f refKσ σ=  (28) 
where fK  and bσ  are the stress intensity factor and 
reference bending stress respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, 
the reference bending stress is defined at the highest point 
of single tooth contact point (HPSTC), and can be written 
as

Fig. 4 shows the influenc of tooth number on the failure 
mode of the pinion. As the tooth number increases, the 
failures of the pinion will happen at high input torques.  It 
is found the pinion with tooth number under 29 fails due 
to  the surface failure. When the tooth number is geater 
than 29, the break failure dominates.  
Fig. 5 shows the  influence of profile shifted factor on the 
failure mode of the pinion. As the value of profile shifted 
factor 1X  increases, the input torque will also increase to 
cause surface failure. However, it has little effects on the 
break failure. Generally, the break failure will dominate 
for positive values of profile shifted factor 1X , and the 
surface failure for negative values. 
Fig. 6 shows the influenc of tooth hardness on the failure 
mode of the pinion. As the tooth hardness increases, the 
failures of the pinion will happen at high input torques. It 
is found the pinion with hardness under 270 fails due to  
the surface failure. When the tooth hardness is geater than 
270, the break failure dominates. 
VI. Conclusion 
In this study, the influence of gear parameters on the 
pinion life was discussed. When pinion with fewer tooth 
number, negative profile-shifted factor and lower tooth 
hardness, the surface failure mode dominated. On the 
contrary, the break failure happened at high values of 
tooth number and tooth hardness, and positive profile-
shifted factor.
