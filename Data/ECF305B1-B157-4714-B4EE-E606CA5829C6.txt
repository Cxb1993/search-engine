Abstract 
Ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials often have high strength but poor tensile ductility. The 
poor tensile ductility can be attributed to the low work hardening rate during plastic deformation. 
Work hardening rate can be increased by dislocation and twin interactions. In this study, different 
stacking fault energy (SFE) Ni-Co alloys were fabricated and subject to high pressure torsion 
(HPT) + rolling to a large plastic strain to get a homogeneous UFG structure. Heat treatments 
were performed to annihilate some dislocations and twins. It is expected that dislocations and 
twins can be generated during the subsequent tensile tests and therefore higher work hardening 
rate and better tensile ductility can be obtained. The experimental results indicate that the tensile 
strength decreases but total elongation remains unchanged after annealing in the high SFE 
Ni-40wt.%Co alloy. However, the tensile strength decreases and total elongation increases with 
annealing temperature in the low SFE Ni-65wt.%Co alloy. 
Keywords: Ultrafine-grained material, Ni-Co alloy, severe plastic deformation, HPT, stacking

The microstructure and mechanical behavior of the annealed samples were investigated. 
 
2. Experimental 
Three Ni-Co alloys were produced by induction melting from Co and Ni pellets to give 
compositions of Ni-40wt.%Co, Ni-55wt.%Co and Ni-65wt.%Co. These three alloys form fcc 
solid solutions. It is well established that the addition of cobalt reduces the SFE of the alloy. 
Using a detailed compilation of SFE data for various Ni-Co alloys, which are plotted to give a 
line of best fit [23], the SFE were estimated as ~100, ~60 and ~20 mJ/m2 for the Ni-40wt.%Co, 
Ni-55wt.%Co and Ni-65wt.%Co alloys, respectively. The as-cast alloys were machined into discs 
of 1 mm in thickness and 10 mm in diameter and these discs were processed by HPT at room 
temperature to a total of 5 revolutions at 1 rpm under an applied pressure of 6.0 GPa. Following 
HPT, the discs were cold-rolled at ambient temperature to thin ribbons with a thickness of 0.2 
mm corresponding to a rolling reduction of 80%.  
The recrystallization temperatures of the three alloys were measured by differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) using a TA-MDSC 2920 under a constant heating rate of 10oC/min in a 
nitrogen atmosphere at the temperature range between 25oC and 550oC. Heat treatments of the 
three alloys were conducted at temperatures below their recrystallization temperatures.  
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were prepared from the as-deformed 
specimens by mechanically grinding samples to a thickness of ~150 μm. Final thinning was done 
by twin-jet electropolishing, in a 20% perchloric acid and 80% methanol solution at -20oC and 
10V. The microstructures were characterized using a Philips CM200 transmission electron 
microscope at 200 kV. Dark field images were employed to determine the grain sizes. Selected 
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were also recorded in both alloys and these patterns 
were used to determine the misorientation angles of the grain boundaries. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using Cu Kα radiation to estimate 
the dislocation densities. The θ-2θ scans were performed at room temperature at a scan rate of 
1º/min. Pure Al annealed at 400oC was used as an XRD peak-broadening reference for both the 
grain size and the microstrain calculations. The peak parameters, including the peak intensity, the 
peak-maximum position, the full-width half-maximum and the integral breadth, were determined 
using Microcal (TM) Origin® by fitting a Lorentzian function to the measured peaks. The entire 
tensile specimens were scanned for the XRD analysis.  
Tensile test samples were machined from the cold-rolled specimens to a gauge length of 10 
plastic deformation in low SFE materials (as seen in Table 1). However, when the grain size is 
too small, dislocation and twin densities are saturated. It is difficult to accumulate dislocations 
and twins during the subsequent tensile tests and therefore the work hardening rate remains low. 
This situation was improved by employing microstructure engineering. Heat treatments were 
used to annihilate some pre-existing dislocations and twins in this work. Differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) results indicate that the recrystallization temperature decreases with increasing 
SFE. The recrystallization temperatures for Ni-40wt.%Co, Ni-55wt.%Co and Ni-65wt.%Co 
alloys are 375oC, 345oC and 315oC, respectively. Therefore, temperatures below recrystallization 
temperature were used for annealing these alloys.

The engineering stress-strain curves of the three as-deformed and some selected annealed 
samples are shown in Fig. 2. The increase in strength of the as-deformed Ni-65wt.%Co alloy is 
derived from a smaller grain size, a higher twin density and a higher dislocation density where 
the SFE is low by comparison with the Ni-40wt.%Co and Ni-55wt.%Co alloys (Table 1). The 
increase in tensile ductility is primarily caused by the higher dislocation accumulation in the 
Ni-65wt.%Co alloy due to the higher initial twin density, which leads to a higher work hardening 
rate during tensile testing. It has been reported that a high density of initial pre-existing twins can 
produce both high strength and high ductility [24, 25]. This is because twins act as effective 
barriers that block the slipping dislocations and force them to accumulate on and near the twin 
boundaries. After the samples were annealed, YS and UTS are reduced in all three alloys. The 
strength decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The annealed Ni-40wt.%Co alloys 
have lower strength but the total elongation remains unchanged. However, total elongation 
increases with decreasing SFE. This is more evident in the high temperature annealed samples. 
For samples annealed slightly lower than their recrystallization temperatures (370oC, 340oC and 
310oC) in the Ni-40wt.%Co, Ni-55wt.%Co and Ni-65wt.%Co alloys, the total elongations are 
~7%, ~36% and ~40%, respectively. This result is coincident with our previous study [22], in 
size increases with increasing annealing temperature, as can be seen in Fig. 3a-d. The SAED 
pattern was taken from an area of 0.8μm2 (the selected area diffraction aperture diameter is 1μm) 
for each sample and the ring character becomes less evident with increasing annealing 
temperature. This indicates that grain size becomes larger with increasing annealing temperature. 
The annealed microstructure becomes less diffuse indicative of lower strain field, which reveals 
that dislocation density becomes lower after annealing. Twins can be observed in all samples. 
Additionally, grain boundary thickness fringes can be more easily observed in the annealed 
samples (Fig. 3c and d). In conclusion, the TEM micrographs reveal that (i) the grain size 
increases and (ii) dislocation density decreases with annealing temperature.

The XRD patterns of the as-deformed and annealed Ni-65wt.%Co alloy are shown in Fig. 4 
500nm 
in tensile testing is attributed to the improved dislocation accumulation and higher rate of 
strain hardening. 
2. The annealed samples have (i) increased grain size and (ii) lower dislocation density (strain 
field). 
3. The tensile strength decreases but total elongation remains unchanged after annealing in the 
high SFE Ni-40wt.%Co alloy. However, the tensile strength decreases and total elongation 
increases with annealing temperature in the low SFE Ni-65wt.%Co alloy. 
4. The significant drop of UTS and extensive increase of total elongation in the Ni-65wt.%Co 
alloy when the annealing temperature changes from 200oC to 250oC is related to the larger 
grain size, lower dislocation density and texture change.

此研究結果與原計畫內容相符：我們配置了不同疊差能之材料，並利用高壓扭轉變形

後及退火後之微觀組織由 TEM 及 XRD 分析。而排除固溶強化影響，發現疊差能對奈米晶
材料之機械性質影響頗大，降低材料之疊差能(SFE)可細化晶粒、增加差排與雙晶密度，而
使材料具高強度及延展性。此外，退火處理後可消去一些差排及雙晶，同時也增加晶粒尺

二、 與會心得 
Ultrafine-grained 及 Nanostructured materials (NS)之強度雖較粗晶材料高，但其延展性卻
很差，因而限制了其工業上之應用。主要原因為 UFG/NS 材料之晶粒尺寸小，差排於晶粒內
部滑移之時間與空間均較小，故差排交互作用機會小，而導致有限之加工硬化產生。加工硬
化可延遲頸縮(necking)的發生，而增加材料之延展性。因此目前世界上多個實驗室均以提升
UFG/NS 之加工硬化率及延展性為主要目標。Johns Hopkins University 之 E. Ma 等人在奈米晶
銅的基材裡，利用退火處理長出幾顆微米級的晶粒，即使其具 bimodal grain size 之微觀結構，
則可使其強度稍微下降一些，但是延展性可大幅提升。另外 K. Lu 等人及本人之前的研究則
是以改變材料之晶界結構，以得到高延展性。本人於此次的報告中，則是製作不同微觀結構
的純銅，並經退火處理以得到不同晶粒尺寸及雙晶密度來探討其對延展性的影響。此研究使
用銅，因其退火後易產生退火雙晶，雙晶晶界可為差排滑移時之障礙物，固可提高差排於晶
粒內部交互作用之機會，進而提升其延展性。相信在此研究不斷進行後，能對未來工業上的
應用給予有效的參考。
