二、計畫源由與目的
With the chemical sensors and
biosensors develop continuously, the
miniaturization, multi-function and
intelligence of sensors are attended
gradually. Nonetheless, the configuration of
conventional reference electrodes played
important roles in sensing system are
consisted of glass and ceramic, they are
huge, costly, and fragile. In addition, the
traditional reference electrode can’t integrate
with array sensors. The aimed problem of
them is that they can’t detect analyte in a
micro-amount, so the miniaturization and
the integration between reference electrodes
and working electrodes are the main task to
the point.
According to several literatures [1-9],
various reference electrodes have been
researched for many years. The purpose of
investigation is mainly to fabricate reference
electrodes that have characteristic of stable
responses on reference voltage. As far as
paper presents and commodities information
shows [10-12], the common operation
theory of reference electrodes is related to
“liquid junction mode”, it provides excellent
property to reference electrode.
Recently, the screen-printing
technology is applied to the fabrication of
sensors popularly. In this study, a silver
reference electrode based on polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) substrate was fabricated,
the device combined reference electrode and
working electrode on a substrate to carry out
a miniaturization and integration sensing
device.
三、研究方法
Fabrication of potentiometric pH sensor
based on SnO2/carbon/Ag/PET
At first, the polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) substrate was prepared before
sputtered a SnO2 thin film on it. Step one of
the fabrication is cutting a certain size
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate.
Then, the PET substrate is coated with Ag
paste and carbon paste by a special pattern
to form a primarily pH sensor. So far, the
potentiometric pH sensor is completed, but
we still have to sputter a SnO2 thin film on
carbon layer, in virtue of enhancing the
sensitivity of sensor in and of itself. Figure 1
shows the fabrication of potentiomtric pH
sensor based on SnO2/carbon.
四、結果與討論
Potentiometric response of pH sensor –
1×1 measurement
In this experiment, the multi electrode
based on PET substrate was utilized to
detect the hydrogen ions concentration of
buffer solution from a range of pH2 to pH12.
The readout circuit of all measurement
system was consisted by differential
pair-based integration circuit and the gain of
signal was maintained a uniform figure 1
V/V. Of all the electronic circuit applied in
this experiment is shown in Figure 2.
As the electrochemical knowledge, the
potentiometric response of pH electrode
always abides by Nerst equation, the
saturation value of pH electrode will
approach to 59 mV/pH ultimately. In
accordance with above mention, no sooner
had the response reached to the terminate
number, the pH sensor may was an ideal
device. Table 1 indicates the sensitivity and
the final saturation voltage of each eight pH
electrode, all of them was integrated into
one PET substrate. The best sensitivity was
60.3 mV/pH and the least significant one
was 36.3 mV/pH, besides using Nerst
equation to account the best one’s sensitivity,
the reason of worse one occurred may credit
the mistake of operation or the defects of
sensing thin film. The another one’s
calibration curve of eight multi electrodes
based on PET substrate is shown in Figure 3
and characteristic equation is 0.523X –
0.3118 = Y, linearity is 0.9742. The data
means this sensing electrode is well enough
