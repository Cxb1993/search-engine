Abstract Wavelet-based bispectral analy-
sis is addressed for condition monitoring of
induction machines. This advanced signal pro-
cessing technique combining wavelet analysis
and bispectral techniques allows the detection
and characterization of non-Gaussian and
non-stationary signals with time resolution
and the discrimination linear processes from
nonlinear ones. In the present investigation,
application of this new technique to detect
and identify an induction machine’s asymme-
try faults by measuring vibration data and
analyzing the nonlinearity of the machine, due
to the fact that damaged or faulty machines
often generate highly nonlinear signals. The
usefulness and statistical robustness of this
approach are confirmed in the experiment.
The results and analysis indicate that this
novel signal processing technique can be
successfully applied to induction machine
condition monitoring.

the analysis of machine vibration signal under
normal and faulty conditions.
三、 研究方法
Wavelet analysis is an approach which decom-
poses a time-domain signal into components in
different time windows and different frequency
bands and presents the resulting information
in the form of a surface in the time-frequency
plane, sometimes referred to as a scalogram
[6]. The scalogram is similar in concept to
the spectrogram but differs from in that the
frequency resolution of the scalogram is loga-
rithmic rather than linear, as is the case for
the spectrogram. Because of the nature of
the frequency resolution, the wavelet approach
is more effective in analyzing both the long-
time, low-frequency and the short-time, high-
frequency content of a time signal. This char-
acteristic is very useful for analyzing pulse-like
and non-stationary signals.
The continuous wavelet transform of a
square-integrable, continuous time signal x(t)
is the inner product between and the analysing
wavelet ψα,β(t), which gives the wavelet coeffi-
cients
Wx(α, β) =
1√
α
∫ ∞
−∞
x(t)ψ∗(
t− β
α
) (1)
where α is the dilation parameter governing
the wavelet frequency, β is the parameter lo-
calizing the wavelet function in the time do-
main and ψ∗(t)is the complex conjugate of the
analysing wavelet ψ(t).
Because the Fourier-based higher-order
spectral methods are not capable of captur-
ing the transient intermittent nonlinear in-
teractions. Therefore, the use of wavelet-
based bispectral analysis is the thrust of this
study. The wavelet-based bispectrum is given
by [7, 8, 9, 10]:
BWxyz(αk, αl, β) =∫
T
Wx(αk, τ)Wy(αl, τ)Wz(αm, τ)dτ (2)
where

The wavelet-based auto-bispectrum is de-
fined as
BWxxx(αk, αl, β) =∫

The bicoherence spectrum is a normalized
bispectrum which measures quadratic phase
coupling. The wavelet-based bicoherence spec-
trum is evaluated as:
[bWxyz(αk, αl, β)]

fective motor signatures, several faults in the
machines are used to investigate the proposed
technique.
The experimental setup used in this study
consists of a 2.2 kW, 1740 rpm, 4-pole in-
duction machine driving a 5 kW DC genera-
tor via a flexible coupling, as shown in Fig.
2. The generator is used to absorb the en-
ergy generated by the motor. In order to
test the proposed new signal processing tech-
nique for condition monitoring of induction
machines, several conditions are under inves-
tigation. There are the bearing fault under
full-load operation. Two bearings are of NTN-
type NTN6206. Their outer and inner diame-
ters are 62 and 30 mm, respectively and each
has 9 balls of diameter 9.5 mm. One bearing
is used for normal test and the other with a
hole in the inner race whose defect size is ap-
proximately 1.0 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in
depth is used for identifying the bearing faults.
The broken rotor whose defect size is approxi-
mately 5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in depth
is used for investigation of the rotor condition.
A piezo-electric accelerometer was mounted
on the housing of the induction electrical ma-
chine to measure vibration. The measured
vibration signal was fed to the National In-
struments SCC-ACC01 signal conditioning in-
stalled into the SC-2345. A real-time data ac-
5
the faulty rotor condition has been along the
shaft rotation frequencies. This phenomena
are easily observed from Fig. 3(d).
The definitions and estimations of wavelet-
based bispectral technique is introduced in this
report. In order to verify the effectiveness of
this new signal processing technique, it is used
to analyze an induction machine’s vibration
signatures. The results obtained show that
it is easily to identify the machine conditions
from the wavelet-based bispectral plots. In
the present investigation, it is confirmed that
the wavelet-based bispectral technique can be
used for analyzing machine vibration signals
and obtaining essential information for condi-
tion monitoring and fault detection of induc-
tion machines.

Abstract— The purpose of this research is to identify bearing
fault features. This approach uses continuous wavelet transforms
as a non-stationary signal preprocessor and the singular value
decomposition (SVD) technique as salient feature extraction.
Simulations of a model for bearing inner race defect as well
as actual bearing vibration data from a normal bearing and
the defective inner race bearing are used to demonstrate the
proposed method for bearing fault detection and diagnosis. The
results obtained have shown that this approach is effective for
bearing fault detection and diagnosis.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rolling element bearing is one of the most critical
components in rotating electrical machinery due to the fact
that the large majority of problems arise from faulty bearings.
A previous report [1] on failed components of induction
motors has pointed out that the most significant contributor
to bearing failure is inadequate maintenance, and this can, in
turn, result in winding failure within the machine. Therefore,
proper monitoring of bearing condition is highly cost effective
in reducing capital loss.
Vibration-based monitoring techniques, both in the time and
frequency domains, have been widely used for detection and
diagnosis of bearing defects for several decades. A brief review
of vibration monitoring techniques can be found in [2]. These
methods have traditionally been applied, separately, in the
time and frequency domains. A time-domain analysis focuses
principally on statistical characteristics of the vibration signal
such as peak level, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis
and crest factor. A frequency domain approach uses Fourier
methods to transform the time-domain signal to the frequency-
domain where further analysis is carried out, conventionally
using vibration amplitude and power spectra. It should be
noted that use of either domain implicitly excludes the direct
use of information present in the other.
However, a relatively new signal processing technique,
called wavelet analysis, is adopted here and used to de-
velop vibration signal processing procedures for bearing fault
detection. The wavelet approach has advantages over tradi-
tional Fourier methods for signal analysis, particularly for
signals containing discontinuities and shape spike. When
Fourier transformation is performed, the signal representation
is moved from the time-domain to the frequency domain and
this change of domain can lead to loss of information and
to interpretation difficulties. This disadvantage is overcome in
wavelet analysis which represents a signal by using shifted and
scaled versions of a so-called mother wavelet and this enables
examination of the frequency information of the signal as it
evolves with time. This ability to represent simultaneously
both time-domain and frequency-domain information is a
significant advantage of the wavelet approach.
The use of the continuous wavelet transform to study
bearings with outer race and inner race defects is presented
in [3]. Scale-wavelet power spectrum and time-wavelet energy
spectrum autocorrelation analysis method were used to extract
fault features. This approach provide a new way for rolling
bearing fault diagnosis. Li and Ma [4] used wavelet trans-
forms to study bearings with outer race and rolling element
defects under a range of load and speed conditions. Different
scales of wavelet transform can provide information about a
bearing defect at various locations, and this property makes
it more effective for the detection of bearing-localised defects
than traditional time-domain or frequency-domain methods.
The complex nature of information obtained from wavelet
transforms make subjective interpretation and diagnostic use
difficult. In order to effectively interpret the wavelet map, the
time-frequency domain is used instead of time-scale domain.
Hence, time-frequency distributions of two specifically simu-
lated signals and the associated singular values performed by
the SVD technique are presented in this paper.
In the following sections, the non-stationary signal process-
ing using the wavelet analysis will be introduced briefly in
Section II. The SVD technique for extracting bearing defective
features from the wavelet coefficients will be developed in
Section III. The simulation results of the proposed approach
for a model for a bearing defective inner race will be given
in Section IV. Experimental studies of normal and defective
bearing vibration signatures using the proposed approach will
be presented in Section V and a conclusion will be presented
in Section VI.

When an impact from the localized bearing defect causes the

the structure as a second-order mass-spring-damper vibration

achieve this goal. Fig. 1(e) shows the first left singular values,
u1 and the most significant frequency at 88 Hz is considered
to be contributed by the undamped natural frequency of the
structure, fn. By further investigations of Fig. 1(f) for the first
right singular values, v1, the times of the occurrence of the
patterns with circular and diamond-shaped markers in this non-
stationary signal are the same as those in Fig. 1(c). Because
the analyzing wavelet is complex-valued, the resulting wavelet
coefficients are complex numbers according to equation (1).
Therefore, only absolute values of the wavelet modulus are
considered and presented in the time-frequency domain.
From the above simulated defective bearing vibration re-
sults, they have demonstrated that the SVD approach is ca-
pable of identifying salient patterns from non-stationary time-
frequency wavelet vibration distribution.
V. ACTUAL BEARING VIBRATION ANALYSIS
In attempt to assess the suitability of the proposed wavelet
analysis and the SVD approach for identifying features useful
for describing defective bearing signatures, two bearings are
used to investigate the bearing faults.
Two bearings are of NTN-type NTN6206. Their outer and
inner diameters are 62 and 30 mm, respectively and each has 9
balls of diameter 9.5 mm. One bearing is used for normal test
and the other with a hole in the inner race whose defect size
is approximately 1.0 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in depth
is used for identifying the bearing faults. The output shaft
bearing of a 2.2 kW/1725 rpm three phase induction motor
drives a generator via a flexible coupling. The generator is
used to absorb the energy generated by the motor.
The bearing vibration signatures of 2048 points sampled at
12 kHz were recorded from the normal and defective bearings.
Fig. 2(a) shows the time signal for the normal bearing under
full-load operation. An example time signal for the defective
inner race under full-load operation is shown in Fig. 2(b).
In comparison with normal bearing time signal, shown in Fig.
2(a), the overall magnitude for defective inner race time signal,
shown in Fig. 2(b) is significantly increased. Figs. 2(c) and (d)
represent the wavelet time-frequency distribution of normal
and defective bearing vibration signatures, respectively. Fig.
3 shows the singular value patterns from the time-frequency
