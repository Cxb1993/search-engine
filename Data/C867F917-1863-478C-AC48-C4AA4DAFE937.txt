第一年期旨在應用車輛辨識系統（automatic vehicle identification, AVI）提昇靜態起迄旅
次矩陣之推估。車牌辨識系統（license plate recognition system, LPR）是 AVI 的一種技術，其
隨著影像辨識技術之成熟。該系統可用於自動辨識車牌號碼，並加以儲存、比對及處理。如
在高速公路上部分路段加以設置，即可比對各通過車輛之實際行駛路段，相較於路段偵測器
可提供更多起迄流量推估之所需資訊。基此，本研究建構一雙層數學規劃模式。其中，上層
以設置成本、起迄旅次推估誤差率及隱私權侵犯等最小化為目標，決策變數為 LPR 之設置區

利用遺傳演算法進行模式求解。為驗證本模式之有效性與應用性，分別應用於簡例及實例（中
山高）。結果均顯示 LPR 最佳設置區位位於路網兩端及中間流量較高之區段。次佳區位則會
選擇設在流量較低區段，以減少隠私權之侵犯。

41. INTRODUCTION
Accurate dynamic origin-destination (O-D) information is essential for implementing real-time
traffic control applications, such as route guidance and ramp metering. Over the past two decades,
some researchers have devoted to develop the estimation algorithms for the dynamic O-D matrices
based on observable mainline and ramp flow rates (e.g. Chang and Wu, 1994; Chang and Tao, 1996,
1999; Lin and Chang, 2005, 2007); while some others have introduced additional assumptions or
exogenous information, such as route choice behaviors, prior O-D matrix information, and sequence
of observational periods of traffic counts data, while estimating the dynamic O-D matrices (e.g. Bell,
1983, 1991; Yang et al., 1992, 1995; Lo et al., 1996; Hazelton, 2001). Yet estimation of dynamic
O-D matrices still remains challenging in that the number of estimated parameters is far greater than
the available information. To tackle this challenge, Chang and Wu (1994) subjectively assumed that
the vehicles entering a freeway in a specific time interval are distributed within a small range (i.e.,
two time intervals). This assumption certainly limits the applicability and accuracy of the
algorithms. Some previous studies (e.g. Chang and Wu, 1994; Chang and Tao, 1996; Lin and
Chang, 2005, 2007) also made subjective assumptions on traffic arrival distributions, which are not
valid for various traffic conditions from free-flow to gridlock.
In view of the importance of arrival distribution prediction in estimating the O-D matrices and the
essence of estimation efficiency for real-time applications, more recently, Chiou et al. (2010) have
proposed an integrated algorithm which combined cell transmission model (CTM) with extended
Kalman filtering (EKF) to respectively and iteratively estimate the arrival distributions and O-D
proportions. Firstly introduced by Daganzo (1994), the CTM can efficiently simulate traffic
hydrodynamics under various traffic conditions. However, the arrival distribution estimations using
CTM are based on an unrealistic assumption that the on-ramp traffic along a freeway remains
unchanged over time. To rectify this unrealistic assumption, a medium-to-long term (e.g. next two
to four hours) prediction model of on-ramp traffic along a freeway is required.
Most of the existing traffic prediction models use statistical methods or artificial intelligent methods
to conduct a short-term prediction (e.g. next 5 minutes). Such short-term prediction models may
experience low performance for medium-to-long term traffic prediction since traffic patterns can
change dramatically (e.g., from peak hours to off-peak and vice versa). According to field
observation, daily traffic patterns do repeat spatially and temporally over and over again. To
enhance the prediction performance for a medium-to-long term traffic, this paper proposes a novel
approach, which includes a two-stage prediction model with K-means algorithm to extract clusters
of traffic patterns and a genetic programming (GP) to predict the traffic for each cluster separately.
In the prediction process, 10 hours of historical traffic data are collected and used to identify the
similar cluster of traffic patterns. The input values of learned GP model belonging to that cluster are
used to predict the subsequent two hours. With the predicted medium-to-long on-ramp traffic, CTM
is used to simulate the arrival patterns. EKF is then employed to estimate the O-D proportions. To
validate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach, an empirical study on a freeway is
examined.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the definition of the problem,
variables and related parameters. Section 3 introduces the framework, the traffic prediction model,
the CTM arrival distribution model, and the EKF O-D matrices estimation. A freeway corridor with
15 interchanges is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed
approach in Section 4. Finally, concluding remarks and suggestions for future research are
discussed.
6Consider the speed variation among drivers, it is reasonable to assume that the travel time of
vehicles from node i to node j during time interval k are distributed among time intervals k-M,…, 
k-1, and k where M is the maximum number of intervals required for vehicles to traverse the entire
freeway section. The traffic volume leaving freeway from off-ramp j, )(ky j , can thus be expressed
as

Obviously, the system formulation has a large number of state parameters, i.e., bij(k) and )(km

 .
The number of these unknown parameters increases with the necessary M value. As such, some
more information is required to ensure this proposed model to be computationally efficient and
tractable.
To deal with the large number of unknown parameters, Chang and Wu (1994) simplified the
formulations by assuming that the speeds of vehicles entering the freeway at the same time interval
are distributed in a small range. Therefore, Eqs. (5) and (6) can be rewritten as

By simplifying the formulation as Eqs. (9) and (10), the number of unknown parameters reduces
from (M + 1)N(N + 1)/2 to 3N(N + 1)/2. However, if the target freeway corridor is sufficiently long
and experiences moderate congestion, the speeds of vehicles for the same O-D may vary in a wide
range. Then, Eqs. (9) and (10) are not adequate for capturing all complex interrelations between
traffic flows and O-D patterns. To deal with these limitations, Lin and Chang (2005) proposed a
new set of generalized formulations by employing a distribution to represent the potential variation
of travel times among drivers due to the impact of congestion and due to the difference in their
desired speeds. They assumed that the travel time of drivers departing from node i during time
interval k to node j follow a specific distribution. Since the travel times for the same O-D pair
drivers departing during the same time interval follow a distribution, Lin and Chang (2005)
replaced )(km

By applying the above travel time distribution concept, the relationships between ramp volumes and
O-D proportions can be rewritten as:

Figure 2 presents the detailed framework of the proposed approach. Throughout the prediction
process, K-means algorithm is used to cluster traffic patterns and genetic programming (GP) is used
to predict traffic information. Moreover, CTM is used to simulate the arrival patterns and EKF is
used to estimate the O-D proportions.

To replicate traffic behaviors by CTM, traffic demand of each OD pair has to be given in advance.
That is, a set of bij(k) has to be determined and used to assign the detected on-ramp traffics to
different downstream interchanges. Once the arrival distributions of all entering traffic have been
successfully simulated, )(km

entering traffic qi(k) by EKF, namely bij’(k). Then, the new O-D proportions bij’(k) will be used to

4. TWO-STAGE TRAFFIC PREDICTION MODEL
Although numerous studies have employed various methods to predict traffic flows, such as the
statistical time-series or regression model (Chang and Miaou, 1999), Sequential Learning model
(Chen, 2001), Artificial Neural network (Dia, 2001), Kalman Filtering model (Okutani, 1984), and
Grey Prediction model (Chiou et al., 2007). However, most of these studies mainly focused on
short-term traffic prediction under the assumption that the traffic pattern will remain unchanged. In
this case, the traffic flow for medium-to-long term traffic periods may significantly differ from
previous short-term traffic periods, hence the mentioned prediction models are inapplicable. In
Taiwan’s case, to stimulate the arrival distribution of traffic flow from Taipei to Kaohsiung,
on-ramp freeway traffic for the next four to six hours must be effectively and efficiently predicted.
Hence, medium-to-long term traffic prediction becomes necessary.
According to our field observations, traffic pattern did repeat spatially and temporally over and over
again. In order to simplify the prediction process, past historical traffic flows (a week or a month)
are divided into sufficient long traffic periods which will allow a specific pattern to be recognized
(e.g. twelve hours) with a rolling horizon concept. These traffic periods are then classified into
several clusters so that the traffic period in each cluster will exhibit a similar pattern. Finally,
genetic programming (GP) is employed to develop a traffic prediction model for each cluster
separately. Thus, two-stage traffic prediction model is proposed in this study.
With respect to the nature of traffic patterns which may repeat spatially and temporally, the purpose
of this study is to classify traffic patterns into a certain number of clusters each of which exhibit
similar patterns. The traffic pattern is defined as a sequence constituted by 5-minute traffic data
within a twelve hours period. Consequently, each of traffic patterns contains a total of 144 time
intervals (5-minute). By using a concept of rolling horizon as depicted in Figure 4, each of traffic
patterns is generated in a lag of one-hour. For example, the first traffic pattern of an on-ramp traffic
data is Monday 12:00 am ~ 12:00 pm, the second traffic pattern is Monday 1:00 am ~ 1:00 pm, the
third is Monday 2:00 am ~ 2:00 pm, etc. Taking the middle part of Taiwan No.1 Freeway between
Toufen Interchange to Beidou Interchange (a total of 15 interchanges) during May 25th to May 31st
(from a Monday to Sunday).The number of traffic patterns is totally 2,355.

By following the generation of traffic patterns, a K-means method is used to classify them into
several exclusive clusters. For each of clusters, the first 120 time intervals of each traffic patterns in
the same cluster is used to train the genetic programming (GP) prediction model while the rest of 24

Step 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until convergence. Typical convergence criteria includes no further
reassignment of patterns to new clusters, the change in error function E falls below a
threshold, or a predetermined number of iterations has been reached.
4.2 Traffic Prediction
The medium-to-long term traffic prediction models are developed in this study and employed to
predict a total of m  ththth mnnnei  ,...,2,1.. periods of sequence based on its historical and
primitive n time-series data,  nkkxX  1,00 for each cluster separately, where kx0 is a
time-series data at time k and m is the length of prediction period. Since the number of traffic
patterns needed to construct the prediction model is unknown a priori, the GP algorithm is
especially suitable for the traffic prediction model. Genetic programming is a technique for
programming computers by means of natural selection (Koza, 1992). It is a variant of the genetic
algorithm developed by Holland et al. (1975), based on the concept of adaptive survival in natural
organisms.
The GP algorithm is a global optimization scheme based on the mechanism of natural selection and
offspring generation. It starts with a population of randomly generated individual trees. Every tree
corresponds to the linear combination of traffic flow. Every generated tree is then evaluated for
fitness. The fitness value of every tree is utilized as the measurement for selection to generate
offspring trees. Brief introductions to these methods are provided below.
Step 0: Define function set and terminal set.
Programs are expressed in genetic programming as syntax trees rather than as lines of code.
The tree includes nodes and links. The nodes indicate the instructions to execute. Function
sets may consist of the arithmetic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division as well as a conditional branching operator; the function set, F, for this research is F
= {＋, －, ×}. The links indicate that the arguments for each instruction called terminals
set may consist of the program's independent variables and numerical constants. The
terminal set, X, for this research is X = {x(t),x(t-1), … ,x(t-10), x(t-11)}, and

4.4 Results
To examine the feasibility of the proposed prediction model, the traffic data sets were employed and
implemented. This research applied traffic counts with five minutes time interval in real-time
from loop detectors at the mid-section of Taiwan No.1 Freeway, a three-lane freeway measuring
120 km long, with 15 on ramp interchanges from Toufen Interchange to Beidou Interchange within
a week (2009, May 25th to 2009, May 31st). The week of traffic data an hour into the future are
then inputted into the proposed prediction algorithm.
This section introduces k-means algorithm to the cluster traffic patterns, and employs genetic
programming (GP) to develop a traffic prediction model for each cluster separately. The detailed
process and results is as presented.
4.4.1 Clustering Traffic Pattern with K-means
Using k-means to cluster a week of traffic data with a rolling horizon concept between Toufen
Interchange and Beidou Interchange, when traffic pattern reaches 2355, for example, the optimal
clustering number is 72 clusters. Within the 3 cluster groups, each cluster consist of 4 traffic
pattern. Cluster Group 1 includes Taichang (Mon.12-24), Taichang system (Tue.12-24), Taichang
(Wed.12-24) and Taichang (Thu. 12-24) traffic patterns. The Cluster Group 2 includes Taichang
system (Mon. 8-20), Taichang system (Tue.8-20), Taichang system (Wed. 8-20) and Taichang
system (Thu. 8-20). Fengyuan (Mon.21-Tue.9), Fengyuan (Tue. 21-Wed.9), Fengyuan (Wed.
21-Thu.9) and Fengyuan (Thu. 21-Fri.9) are in Cluster Group 3, with a total of 46 traffic patterns
clustered in the same group.

5. CELL-BASED ARRIVAL DISTRIBUTION MODELING
This study employs CTM to predict the arrival distribution of an O-D pair traffic, which will then
be used to compute )(km
ij
 .
5.1 Cell Transmission Model
As shown in Figure 8, a freeway is equally discretized into homogeneous sections (cells), numbered
consecutively from i = 1 to I starting with the upstream end of the road, where the length of each
cell is the distance traveled by a vehicle in one clock tick under light traffic.
Figure 8. Cell representation of a freeway corridor
In light traffic, all vehicles in a cell can be assumed to advance to the next cell with each click. It is
unnecessary to know where within the cel they are located. Therefore, the system’s evolution 
obeys:
ni+1(t + 1) = ni(t) for t= 0, 1, 2, …, T (24)
where ni(t) is the number of vehicles in cell i at time t. It is assumed that this equation holds true for
all traffic flows unless queuing occurs. The following two variables are introduced to incorporate
queuing in the model: (1) Qi(t), the maximum flow from cell i–1 to i during time interval t (when
the clock advances from t to t + 1), also known as “capacity,” and (2) Ni(t), the maximum number
of vehicles that can be present in cell i in time t. Thus, Ni(t)–ni(t) is the amount of empty space in
cell i at time t.
The CTM assumes a simplified version of the fundamental diagram, usually based on a trapezium
form, as shown in Figure 9, and provides simple solutions for realistic networks. It is assumed that a
free-flow speed v at low densities and a backward shockwave speed w for high densities are
constant (v ≥w).
Figure 9. Fundamental diagram of CTM
With these, we define yi(t) as the number of vehicles that can flow into i for time interval t as:
yi(t) = min{ni-1(t) , Qi(t) ,
v
w
[Ni(t)–ni(t)]} (25)
The CTM is based on a recursion where the cell occupancy at time t + 1 equals its occupancy at

8. CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper has developed an integrated estimation algorithm by combining cell transmission model
(CTM) and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) to respectively and iteratively estimate the arrival
distribution and the O-D proportions. Our results from an exemplified example of a freeway
corridor have shown that CTM can surely capture the traffic dispersion under various traffic
conditions. The degree of traffic dispersion will get enlarged as traffic flow increases. The results
from a case study on Taiwan No.1 Freeway have also shown that the proposed algorithm can
accurately estimate the O-D proportions with a low RMSE of 0.0414. The applicability of the
proposed integrated algorithm has been proven.
Several directions for future research can be identified. First, the applicability and efficiency of the
proposed algorithm on a large scale network should be further examined. Second, due to data
availability in the case study, the O-D matrices are arbitrarily given and then used to generate“real
time”detected traffic flows by traffic simulation software, DynaTaiwan. However, with advanced
traffic surveillance technologies, it is feasible to collect real time traffic information in the future
study to further examine the applicability of the proposed algorithm. Third, the proposed algorithm
is only valid for the case of linear freeway corridor. In the future study, route choice behaviors
should be incorporated to the proposed algorithm to suit for more complicated networks. Fourth, the
estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm under various traffic conditions also deserves further
investigation and comparison. Last but not least, comparisons with other algorithms should also be
conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

值（簡要敘述成果所代表之意義、價值、影響或進一步發展之可能性）（以
500 字為限）
本計畫為三年期計畫，具體完成之研究成果如下：
1.建立車牌辨識系統（LPR）預測模式
在進行動態起迄旅次矩陣預測時，由於 LPR 所辨識車輛之部份行徑資料必須加以進一步
推估及判斷，方能據以建立有效之流量方程式。基此，本研究利用中觀車流模式（cell
transmission model，CTM）及短及中長期交通量預測模式進行短期車輛推移之模擬，俾作為
起迄矩陣推估之用。
2.中長期交通量預測模式－兩階段預測模式
基於交通型態會重複發生的特性，本研究先利用 K-means 以滾動時間軸特性，進行上匝
道交通型態之分群，再利用遺傳規劃法（genetic programming model）進行各分群交通量預測
模式之建構，俾進行中長期交通量之預測（2 至 4 小時），以作為動態起迄矩陣推估之輸入資
料。
3.建立中觀車流模式
為能有效進行進入匝道交通量在研究路網上時空推移之模擬，本研究利用格位傳遞模式
（CTM）中觀車流模式模化在時間 t 進入高速公路之交通量，到達其目的地交流道之到達型
態分佈情形，俾反應不同交通狀態下，到達分佈擴散情形(dispersion)，以更精準推估動態起
迄矩陣。
4.建立動態起迄旅次矩陣之推估模型
本研究整合兩階段交通量預測模式、CTM 推估交通量到達擴散分佈型態預測模式，以及
LPR 增列之交通觀測方程式，利用卡門濾波理論進行動態起迄矩陣之推估。
以往有關動態起迄矩陣推估之相關研究，大多必須假設車輛到達目的地交流道之分佈型
態（平均分佈於少數區間內或假設為常態分配），其僅能適用於某一種交通型態（例如，自由
流、同步流或擁塞流）下之推估。本研究所提出之整合動態起迄矩陣推估模式，不僅可適用
於不同交通型態下之動態起迄矩陣推估，亦能進行中長期交通量預測，方能真正達到動態起
迄矩陣推估之目的。

Abstract: This paper proposed an integrated algorithm, which combined cell transmission model
(CTM) with extended Kalman filtering (EKF) to respectively and iteratively estimate the arrival
distributions and O-D proportions. A freeway corridor was used to investigate the capability of
CTM in replicating traffic dispersion phenomenon. Results showed that CTM can accurately
capture the traffic dispersion under various traffic conditions and that the degree of traffic
dispersion gets larger as traffic flow increases. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
algorithm, a case study of Taiwan’s freeway was conducted. Results showed that the proposed
algorithm can accurately estimate the O-D proportions with rather low RMSE.

1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate dynamic origin-destination (O-D) information is required for the implementation of
real-time traffic control measures, such as real-time route guidance and signal control. Numerous
studies have devoted to developing estimation algorithms for the dynamic O-D matrix based mainly
on observable mainline and ramp flow rates. The dynamic O-D matrices estimation algorithms can
be divided into two categories (Ho, 2008): assignment-based (e.g. Ashok and Ben-Akiva, 2000,
2002) and non-assignment-based (e.g. Chang and Wu, 1994; Chang and Tao, 1996, 1999; Lin and
Chang, 2005, 2007). The assignment-based method primarily relies on a dynamic traffic assignment
algorithm to generate link flows; while the non-assignment-based method directly estimates O-D
matrices. However, this issue remains challenging in that the number of parameters to be estimated
is always far greater than the available information, thus additional assumption or exogenous
information, such as route choice behaviors, priori O-D matrix information, sequence of
observational periods of traffic counts data (e.g. Bell, 1983, 1991; Yang et al., 1992, 1995; Vardi,
1996; Lo, et al., 1996; Hazelton, 2001), should be further considered.
One of the most challenging issues remained to be tackled in the context of dynamic O-D matrices
estimation is the impact of travel time variability on the time-varying O-D matrices. Chang and Wu

Compared to Chang and Wu (1994), the number of unknown parameters for eqs. (12) and (13) has
reduced from 3N(N + 1)/2 to 2N(N + 1)/2. On the other hand, Lin and Chang (2005) represented the
different speeds of vehicles for the same O-D pair by using the distribution of travel time.
Although the relevant studies (e.g. Chang and Wu, 1994; Chang and Tao, 1995; Lin and Chang,
2005, 2007) have shed light on the dynamic O-D matrices estimation, most of them made
subjectively assumptions regarding arrival distributions, which may not be valid for various
conditions from free-flow to gridlock. In addition, most of these models are too complex, causing
low efficiency in estimation. In view of the importance of the arrival distribution prediction and the
estimation efficiency required for real-time implementation, this study aims to develop a model that
can accurate capture the traffic hydrodynamics under various traffic conditions in an efficient
manner.
3. CELL-BASED ARRIVAL DISTRIBUTION MODELING
The CTM conceptual representation of spatial and temporal conditions of traffic is especially
suitable for dynamic O-D matrices estimation. The present paper employs CTM to predict the
arrival distribution of an O-D pair traffic, which will then be used to compute )(km
ij
 .
As shown in Figure 2, a freeway is equally discretized into homogeneous sections (cells), numbered
consecutively from i = 1 to I starting with the upstream end of the road, where the length of each
cell is the distance traveled by a vehicle in one time interval under free-flow traffic. In this study,
we set time interval as 30 seconds and free-flow speed as 120 km/hr. The cell length is then
determined as 1 km.
Figure 2 Cell representation of a freeway corridor
In light traffic, all vehicles in a cell can be assumed to advance to the next cell with each interval. It
is unnecessary to know where within the cel they are located. Therefore, the system’s evolution 
obeys:
ni+1(t + 1) = ni(t) for t= 0, 1, 2, …, T
where ni(t) is the number of vehicles in cell i at time t. It is assumed that this equation holds true for
all traffic flows unless queuing occurs. The following two variables are introduced to incorporate

5.1 Replicating Traffic Dispersion Phenomenon
To show the capability of CTM in replicating the traffic hydrodynamics and to investigate the
degree of traffic dispersion under various traffic conditions, a simulation on the above-mentioned
three-lane freeway section with 6 interchanges is conducted. Parameters are set as follows: free
flow speed=120 km/hr, jam density=125 vehicles per kilometre per lane, capacity=7,200 vehicles
per hour, cell storage capability=375 vehicles, time interval=30 seconds, and cell length=1 km.
Four scenarios with various traffic conditions are simulated, including free-flow, light synchronized
flow, heavy synchronized flow and congested flow. All entering traffic is increased step-by-step by
a same ratio ranging from 10% to 100%. The traffic condition of the roadway is determined by its
most critical segment (i.e. the most congested segment which is usually located at the middle of the
roadway). Until the traffic flow at the most critical segment reaches its capacity, it is under
free-flow condition. After oversaturation, traffic conditions are equally divided into three traffic
phases: light synchronized, heavy synchronized, and congested flows. For instance, for the traffic
leaving from the same origin 0 (Taishan Toll station) and heading for various destinations (Linkou
interchange to Yangmei Toll station) in time interval t=1, their arrival distributions under various
traffic conditions are graphically depicted in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6 (a), almost all the
ranges of arrival times cover only one or two intervals under free-flow condition. Once the traffic
flow increases, the degree of traffic dispersion will significantly appear. As shown in Figures
6(b)-(d), in light synchronized flow, the remaining storage capacity and flow capacity of next cell is
sufficient, all vehicles in a cell can be assumed to advance to the next cell with each interval, the
same entering traffic will arrive at destination among a wider range of time intervals ranging from
two to three time intervals, when the entering traffic increasing to the remaining storage capacity
and flow capacity of next cell is not sufficient, only part of them can move proportionally, four to
five time intervals under heavy synchronized flow, and six to eight time intervals under congested
flow, suggesting the capability of the CTM model in replicating traffic dispersion phenomenon.

generated (RG) approach and equal share (ES) approach. Take origin No.4 interchange as an
example, the associated O-D proportions are denoted as b45(k), b46(k), and b47(k). For the RG
approach, three random numbers 0.123, 0.341, and 0.782 are generated and then normalized such
that the sum of three proportions equals 1. Thus, b45(k)=0.099, b46(k)=0.274, and b47(k)=0.628. In
contrast, for the ES approach, three proportions for the same example is simply set as b45(k)=0.333,
b46(k)=0.333, and b47(k)=0.334.
The distributions of real b15 proportions (from Linkou interchange to Youth interchange) along with
estimated O-D proportions by RG and ES approaches are given in Figure 7. Note that the proposed
algorithm can predict real O-D proportions accurately regardless which initial value setting
approaches being adopted. However, the predicted result by RG approach is slightly superior to that
by ES approach. Thus, the RG approach will be adopted in predicting other O-D proportions.

however, individual contributing factors to the crash (e.g., driver demographics, driver behaviors,
vehicle types) are not considered and factors affecting the crash severity cannot be identified either.
Therefore, some studies employed individual approach to crash data analysis. The individual
approach is characterized by each individual crash case. The main focus of these studies was to
associate the crash severity with driver, vehicle and roadway factors by using ordered probit/logit
model or logistic regression (e.g., Shanker and Mannering, 1996; Dissanayake et al., 2002,
Al-Ghamdi, 2002; Delen, et al., 2002; Tay and Rifaat, 2007; Sze and Wong, 2007). More advanced
logit-based approaches, such as nested logit model or mixed logit model, were also employed to
analyze the same issue (e.g. Shanker, et al., 1996, Chang and Mannering, 1999, Milton, et al.,
2008).
Although statistic models are the commonly used methods in the context of crash data analysis
either collectively or individually, most of them have their own assumptions and complexity in the
model estimation and interpretation. Once the assumptions were violated, the model could lead to
erroneous estimation results, especially for the individual approach wherein most variables
explaining the individual crashes are categorical (e.g., driver gender, road type, lighting condition,
violation, weather condition, and severity degree, among others). It is difficult to develop
parametric statistical models based upon the categorical data. Therefore, a number of
distribution-free methods, such as decision tree (Chang and Chen, 2005; Chang and Wang, 2006)
and artificial neural network (Chiou, 2006; Delen et al., 2006), were adopted to deal with the
classification and prediction problems. However, two gaps still remain. First, the interpretations of
classification results with such methods are weak. The knowledge lying in the crash data cannot be
fully discovered, because artificial neural network is in essence a black box and the prediction error
of decision tree is usually high. Second, most of statistical methods only provide calibrated
parameters with significance tests, which are then used to examine the effects of the corresponding
variables on crash counts or crash severity. The interrelationship among explanatory factors cannot
be examined in details. According to“error chain theory,”a crash is often caused by a series of
errors, not solely by a single factor. As such, mining the explanatory rules is deemed necessary for
crash data analysis.
Rule mining, also known as rule generation, rule recovery, or classification/association rule mining,
is one of data mining techniques intended to mine for knowledge from available databases and
toward decision support. Rule mining is naturally modeled as multi-objective problems with three
criteria: (1) predictive accuracy, (2) comprehensibility, and (3) interestingness (Freitas, 1999; Ghosh
and Nath, 2004). To automatically search for the optimal combination of rules from a considerable
number of potential rules, genetic algorithms (GAs) are perhaps the most commonly used method.
By employing GAs to learn of rules is named as genetic mining rule (GMR) (e.g. Freitas, 1999;
Shin and Lee, 2002; Ghosh and Nath, 2004; Dehuri and Mall, 2006; Chen and Hsu, 2006). The
performances of rule mining algorithms have been proven and applied in many fields. Thus, this
paper aims to develop GMR model that can determine the optimal combination of appraisal rules to

In Taiwan, crash severity in police investigation report is classified into three degrees: A1 (fatal
crash), A2 (injury crash), and A3 (non-injury crash). The cases for these three degrees of crash
severity are 494, 4,073, and 41,177, respectively—an uneven distribution commonly seen in the
context of crash analysis. To avoid misleading results caused by sample disproportionate problem,
A2 and A3 crash cases are randomly re-selected to the same number as A1 crash cases (494), thus
making a total of 1,482 crash cases for our analysis. Furthermore, 70% of these 1,482 crash cases
are randomly chosen for training (i.e., 1,037 cases) and the remaining 445 cases are used for model
validation.χ2-test is performed and the result shows that severity distributions between training and
validation datasets do not significantly differ.
3. GENETIC MINING RULE MODEL
Genetic mining rule (GMR), which can automatically learn of comprehensive rules from available
dataset and toward decision support, is useful in accident analysis (Clarke et al., 1998). The
encoding method, fitness function, genetic operators, and rule selection of the proposed GMR
model are narrated below.
3.1 Encoding Method
To represent the relationship between explanatory variables and crash severity, each chromosome is
used to represent a potential if-then rule. The conditions associated in the“if part”are termed as
antecedence part and those in the“then part”are named as consequent part. Besides, the antecedent
part consists of at least one variable, but at most 22 variables, selected from Table 2. And the
consequent part is composed by, of course, only one variable: severity degree. In general, a rule is a
knowledge representation of the form“If A Then C,”where A is a set of cases satisfying the
表 Y04 第 22 頁
antecedent) is denoted by A : the cardinality of set A (the number of elements in set A). The
completeness of the rule (i.e., the proportion of cases of the target class covered by the rule) is given
by CCA / . The confidence of rule i (i.e., the predictive accuracy) is given by ACA /
(Freitas, 1999). After several trials on the combination of these three indices, this paper uses
predictive accuracy (PAi) and coverage ratio (CRi) as the fitness function (fi) of rule i, which can be
expressed as follows:
fi = 1000·(CRi) (PAi)2
(1)
3.3 Genetic Operators
Because the genes in our GRM model are not encoded binary, simple genetic algorithms proposed
by Goldberg (1989) cannot be used. Instead, we employ the max-min-arithmetical crossover
proposed by Herrera et al. (1998) and the non-uniform mutation proposed by Michalewicz (1992).
A brief description is given below.
(1) Max-min-arithmetical crossover
Let Gwt ={ gw1t ,…, gwkt ,…, gwKt } and Gvt ={ gv1t ,…, gvkt ,…, gvKt } be two chromosomes
selected for crossover, the following four offsprings can be generated:
G1t+1 = aGwt + (1-a)Gvt
(2)
G2t+1 = aGvt + (1-a)Gwt
(3)
G3t+1 with g3kt+1=min{gwkt, gvkt}
(4)
G4t+1 with g4kt+1=max{gwkt, gvkt}
(5)
where a is a parameter (0 < a < 1) and t is the number of generations.
(2) Non-uniform mutation
Let Gt = { g1t ,…, gkt ,…, gKt } be a chromosome and the gene gkt be selected for mutation (the
domain of gkt is [gkl, gku]), the value of gkt+1 after mutation can be computed as follows:

Table 2 shows the final selected rules along with its corresponding performance indices. Note that a
total of 39 rules are selected with a descending order according to fi. In terms of fitness value (fi),
the top nineteen rules have remarkably higher values than the rest of twenty rules, suggesting that it
is promising to use only the top nineteen rules to conduct the prediction. In terms of coverage ratio
(CRi), R1 can explain 920 cases, followed by R5 (287 cases) and R2 (135 cases). In contrast, some
rules cover only very few cases, such as R39 (2 cases) and R36 or R37 (5 cases). In terms of
predictive accuracy (PAi), R26 has the highest predictive accuracy (1.000), followed by R2 (0.941),
and R35 the least (0.333).
The importance of variable can be identified by the number of its presence in all rules. The number
of variables with values other than 0 (i.e. the variable is not considered by the rule) or 1 (i.e. the
variable describes a normal condition which is meaningless for accident prevention) in all rules is
then calculated. In this regard, x15 (travel period) is the most important variable which appears in 10
rules, followed by x21 (major cause), x22 (collision type), and x20 (journey purpose). Three variables
are shown in only one rule, which are x5 (obstacle), x9 (marking), and x12 (license), indicating their
least significance to crash severity. There are fourteen rules associated with A1 crash, twenty-two
rules with A2 crash, and three rules with A3 crash. Although not all the rules can be directly and
clearly explained, yet some important information can still be mined from these selected rules.
Taking R1 for instance, the rule indicates that once safety belt is fastened, the accident tends to be
less severe (A3 crash). As to R6, the accident occurring at shoulder or edge tends to be an A1 crash.
In contrast to R6, R9 indicates that the accident occurring in the accelerating/decelerating lane or
ramp tends to be an A3 crash. As to R12, a male driver without a license tends to cause A1 crash.
According to R30, the accident occurring during night-peak tends to be an A1 crash. The above-rule
interpretations might be useful references for law enforcement or management by the related
authorities.

5. COMPARISON
For comparison purpose, a decision tree (DT) model is also used to mine the rules explaining the
same crash dataset. The DT model is performed by SAS Enterprise Miner Release 4.3. Several
settings of the DT model are tried and the best performed settings are as follows. Splitting criterion
is Gini reduction. Minimum number of observations in a leaf is 1. Observations required for a split
search is 8. Maximum number of branches from a node is 2. Maximum depth of tree is 6. Splitting
rules saved in each node is 5. The learning process of the DT model is depicted in Figure 2. Note
that the misclassification rate decreases as the number of leaves gets larger.
Table 4 presents the number of cases with various degrees of severity predicted by the DT model.
Note that the DT model performs slightly better in predicting the A2 crash (correct rates in training
and validation are 78.84% and 77.18%, respectively) than the proposed GMR model. However, the
DT model performs much worse than the proposed GMR model while predicting both A1 and A2
crashes. Averagely, the overall correct rates of the DT model in training and validation are 63.84%
and 61.35%, respectively, which are inferior to the proposed GMR model.
In addition, to investigate and compare the performance of the tuned GMR and DT models, all
accident cases (a total of 45,744 cases) are used for validation. Results are shown in Table 5. The
overall correct rates of the GMR and DT models are 69.62% and 59.24%, respectively, which are
slightly lower than those on the balanced dataset. Thus, the performance and applicability of the
proposed GMR model has been demonstrated.

severity, identical numbers of A1-type, A2-type and A3-type of crash cases are drawn from
2003-2007 Taiwan’s freeway accidents dataset. A total of 19 rules have been mined which can
achieve an overall correct rate of 74.25% in training and 70.79% in validation, respectively. Our
proposed GMR model has demonstrated superior to the conventional decision tree (DT) model,
which can only achieve an overall correct rate of 63.84% in training and 61.35% in validation,
respectively, with the same database. According to the mined rules, x5 (obstacle) and x1 (surface
condition) are the two key factors contributing to crash severity. Consequently, attention must be
paid to these two factors to ameliorate the traffic safety.
Some directions for future studies can be identified. First, the neighboring traffic condition of the
crash is also an important factor to crash severity; however, the police accident investigation report
did not record such information. The crash data may be further matched with the traffic database so
as to gain more information regarding the contributing factors to crash severity. Second, since the
interrelationship among contributing factors can be quite different across the accident types,
segmentation of accident dataset according to accident types (e.g., one-vehicle, two-vehicle and
multi-vehicle collisions) prior to the model training will definitely enhance the performance of the
proposed model as it would provide more focused information. Such a data-segmentation deserves
further attempts. Third, in order to lessen the model complexity, various performance indices may
be integrated into an overall fitness function; namely, a multi-objective GMR model deserves
further elaboration. Last but not least, more comparisons can be made to other commonly used
methods (e.g., logistic regression model, ordered Logit model, artificial neural network) to
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.

Abstract: This study aims to empirically investigate customer satisfaction in China low cost carrier
(LCC) market. Three importance-performance analysis (IPA) methods –traditional IPA and two
revised IPA (partial correlation model, PCM and dummy regression model, DRM) are adopted and
compared. The results show that the top-priority attributes to be improved recognized by the
traditional IPA are Flight on-time and Complaint response, which are different to those suggested by
PCM-- Complaint response and Meal service. In addition, according to the evaluation results of
DRM on the passengers with various journey purposes, Attributes importance viewed by passengers
with various journey purposes significantly differs. Corresponding improvement strategies are then
proposed based on three methods.
Key Words: Low cost carrier, service quality, revised IPA
1. INTRODUCTION
The successful low cost air service business model of Southwest Airline has spread worldwide in
the late 2000s. A number of LCCs was established in EU during the late 1990s to the early 2000s. In
the mid of the 2000s, LCC entered Asian market, first in the Southeast Asia, then to China and India.
Numerous studies have focused on low cost carriers in the past decade, but most of the studies are
based in the carriers of EU and US. There is hardly any LCC research focusing on the greater China
market, which is one of the most rapidly growing air transport markets in the world and deserves
in-depth investigation. For better understanding the China LCC market, Shon et al. (2008)
employed traditional importance- performance analysis (IPA) to investigate passenger satisfaction
on the service quality delivered by LCC through an in-flight service quality survey. Based on the
IPA evaluation maps, several improvement and marketing strategies were then proposed.
Obviously, IPA has been applied as an effective method of assessing firm competitiveness,
identifying improvement opportunities, and guiding strategic planning. (Hawes and Rao, 1985;
Martilla and James, 1977; Myers, 2001; Deng, 2007). IPA evaluation map, a major outcome of IPA,
can straightforwardly illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the attributes under investigation
and thus identify directions for service improvement. IPA has also been widely used by researchers
in the fields of aviation and tourism management (e.g. Tonge and Moore, 2007; Huang et al., 2006;
Chen and Chang, 2005; Feng and Jeng, 2005; Zhang and Chow, 2004; Deng, 2007).
However, the interpretation of the IPA evaluation map is based on assumptions of independence
between importance and performance and linearity and symmetry between attribute performance
and overall performance, but many studies question the validity of these assumptions, especially
when respondents were asked to rate the degrees of importance and performance simultaneously
(Eskildsen and Kristensen, 2006). Actually, numerous studies indicate that the relationship between
customer attribute perception (performance) and overall satisfaction is asymmetrical, and the
relationship between attribute importance and attribute performance is causal (Deng, 2007). Thus,
表 Y04 第 32 頁

2.2 Revised Importance-performance Analyses
IPA is a simple and effective technique that can assist practitioners in prioritizing customer
attributes when enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction. Although IPA is an extremely
valuable method, several serious shortcomings still remain. Matzler et al. (2004) noted the
traditional IPA has two implicit assumptions: (1) attribute performance and attribute importance are
independent variables; and (2) the relationship between attribute performance and overall
performance is linear and symmetrical. These assumptions may be erroneous in the real world,
since the relationship between attribute-level performance and customer overall satisfaction is
asymmetrical (Kano et al., 1984; Matzler and Sauerwein, 2002; Matzler et al., 2003; Ting and Chen,
2003; Matzler et al., 2004), and the relationship between attribute performance and attribute
importance is causal (Sampson and Showalter, 1999; Oh, 2001; Ryan and Huyton, 2002; Matzler et
al., 2004).
Therefore, Kano et al., (1984) proposed a two-dimension quality model which classified the
evaluated attributes or products into five categories –attractive, one-dimensional, must-be,
indifference and reverse, based on the concept that the relationship between fulfillment of a need
and the satisfaction or dissatisfaction experienced is not necessarily linear. Obviously, Kano’s 
model can provide more insightful investigations on service quality survey. However, to develop a
Kano’s model, a burdensome questionnaire survey may be required. Therefore, Matzler and 
Sauerwein (2002) and Matzler et al. (2004) suggested a three-factor theory –basic factor,
excitement factor, and performance factor by regressing customer overall satisfaction on two
dummy variables. Based on the core logic, Deng et al. (2007) further proposed a new methodology
(partial correlation analysis with natural logarithmic two dummy variables) for replacing the
conventional Kano’s model to categorize two-dimensional quality attributes and get the customer
satisfaction increment index (CSII) and customer dissatisfaction decrement index (CDDI). Then,
the “effective improving service quality atributes” can be identified according to the graphicaly 
plotted customer satisfaction index matrix. The Deng’s “dummy regression model” comprises five 
steps:
Step 1: Introduce two dummy variables: D1 and D2, where D1 represents the high performance
index and D2 represents low performance index according to the following transformations

According to the questionnaire designed by IATA, air transport service can be represented via nine
service attributes, including seat reservation, ground service, cabin facility, meal service, cabin
service, baggage delivery, complaint response, flight on-time, and flight safety. Based on these
representation scheme, the above 21 statements in the second and third parts of the questionnaire
were aggregated to represent the nine service attributes.
3.2 Data Collection and Analysis
A total of 2,000 questionnaires were disseminated to travelers flying Spring Airlines in airports and
airplane cabins from March 5 to March 11, 2007. Customers completed the questionnaires
themselves before arriving at their destination airport. A total of valid 968 questionnaires were
returned. The breakdown of respondents’ demography is given in Table 2. Interestingly, customers
of Spring Airlines are roughly even split between males and females. Moreover, the majority
(73.6%) of the customers of Spring Airlines are aged below 40 years old, suggesting that young
people are the target market of the airline. Furthermore, in terms of personal occupation, the
customers of the airline are a very diverse group. Most of the customers of Spring Airlines earned
monthly incomes ranging from RMB2001-4000, representing a low income group in the context of
China. A slightly higher percentage of respondents do not hold VIP membership of Spring Airlines
than those having such membership. As for journey purpose, the largest segment is traveling for
tourism (39.4%), followed by business (32.6%), and finally visiting family or friends (28%).
However, the distribution among different journey purposes is relatively even.

表 Y04 第 38 頁
Figure 2 IPA evaluation map
Two attributes, Flight safety and Baggage delivery, are located in the Keep up the Good Work
quadrant. These are thus rated as important attributes in which the airline has achieved good
performance. Although Flight safety is assigned the highest importance among the nine service
attributes, customers are satisfied with the performance of Spring Airlines in this area. Obviously,
despite its good performance in this area, like all airlines Spring Airlines must continue to strive to
improve. Furthermore, a well-managed baggage delivery service also achieved a high importance
rating. This phenomenon indicates that the customers of LCC require a safe, efficient, punctual and
seamless air service. Obviously, Spring Airlines is doing well.
The two attributes of Cabin facility and Meal service are situated in the Low Priority quadrant.
Although these attributes exhibited below average performance, they are also relatively unimportant
to customers. As anticipated, LCC customers have minimal expectations regarding cabin facilities
and meal service. Thus, given resource constraints, such airlines are best allocating resources
elsewhere. To maximize flight profitability, LCCs usually fill the cabin with as many seats as
possible to as to accommodate the largest possible number of passengers. Spring Airlines is no
exception. Each Spring Airlines airplane (Airbus-320) is equipped with 180 seats, the maximum
number this type of aircraft can accommodate. It is suggested that Spring Airlines should reserve
seats near entrances/exits for handicapped customers and design some larger seats (by sacrificing
neighboring seats) for handicapped customers or those willing to pay higher ticket prices. Reducing
meal prices and providing a variety of meals will increase customer satisfaction.
The final three attributes, Cabin service, Ground service and Seat reservation, are located in the
Possible Overkill quadrant. These attributes were rated as low importance and high performance,
indicating the airline should not invest excessively in these areas. With respect to Cabin service,
Spring Airlines currently provides bottled mineral water for each customer. However, bottled water
could be replaced by a paper cup of water to reduce the water procurement costs and on-board
water weight (thus realizing fuel cost savings). Additionally, commercial advertisements on cups
offer a potential untapped revenue source. Since each aircraft accommodates a maximum of 180
customers, the number of check-in channels can be reduced as appropriate to minimize personnel
costs. Furthermore, automatic check-in machines can be installed at airports and customers
encouraged to use them, again reducing personnel costs. In addition, only 20-30% of customers of
Spring Airlines make on-line reservations, with most customers (over 60%) still booking via travel
agents. According to O’Connel and Wiliams (2005), the website booking channel of Ryanair, a
LCC, takes the lion’s share (77.9%) of seat reservations while in the case of Malaysia Airlines, a 
full service carrier, travel agents account for most reservations (50.8%). In fact, low cost airlines are
forcing change through the competitive advantage of online distribution. Spring Airlines thus
should strengthen its online reservation system. The online reservation ratio will increase as the

With the implicitly derived importance and satisfaction performance, the nine LCC service
attributes were plotted on the revised IPA diagram as depicted in Figure 3. Note that Complaint
response and Meal service were located in the Concentrate Here quadrant –perceived to be
important, but performed poorly. Three attributes -- Ground service, Cabin service and Baggage
delivery, were situated in the Keep up the Good Work quadrant, suggesting that passengers
comparatively satisfied with these service attributes delivered by Spring Airlines. Two attributes --
Cabin facility and Flight on-time, were loaded in the Low Priority quadrant. Although these
attributes performed below average, they were considered not very important to the respondents.
Two attributes -- Seat reservation and Flight safety, were identified in the Possible overskill
quadrant that was rated as having low importance and high performance.

4.3 Results of DRM
Table 7 presents the results of DRM. Note that only Seat reservation and Cabin facility are
classified as basic factor, a must-be factor. If the quality of these two attributes is low will
remarkably decrease customer satisfaction, but overfil the quality won’t enhance customer 
satisfaction. Other seven attributes are classified as indifference factor due to the insignificance of
atributes to overal satisfaction, suggesting that passengers don’t pay much attention to the service
quality of these attributes. Such findings are rather different from related studies and our
anticipation. The insignificance of the attributes might be caused by the smoothing effect by
aggregating different types of customers together. Based on this, the DRM is further applied to the
service quality analysis for the customers with various journey purposes.

4.4 Discussions
From the methodological aspect, three IPA methods adopted in this study are rather different.
Unsurprisingly, their evaluation results are also different as shown in Table 9. Noted from Table 9,
the results of DRM method fail to identify key improvement attributes due to the smoothing effect.
However, the DRM method can provide more improvement suggestions based on the segmentation
on journey purposes. Although the evaluation results of the IPA and PCM methods are not
consistent and even contractive, by taking a more conservative point-of-view for service quality
enhancement, this study suggests the airline focusing on the improvement of the attributes which
are identified in the Concentrate Here quadrant by either IPA or PCM, including Meal service,
Complaint response, and Flight on-time and removing resources from the attributes which are
located in the quadrants of Possible Overkill and Low Priority by both IPA and PCM, including Seat
reservation and Cabin facility.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
This study aims to empirically investigate customer satisfaction in China LCC market. The late
introduction of the LCC business model to China market explains little related researches which can
be found. The IPA method is a widely used analytical technique that can assist practitioners in
prioritizing customer attributes when enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction and is
suitable to accomplish the research purpose of this study. However, several drawbacks of IPA have
been identified. Therefore, numerous revised IPA methods have been proposed. To remedy the
drawbacks, two revised IPA methods, namely PCM and DRM models are also adopted. The
top-priority attributes to be improved suggested by IPA are Flight on-time and Complaint response,
while those suggested by PCM are Complaint response and Meal service. Although the evaluation
results of the IPA and PCM methods are not consistent and even contractive, by taking a more
conservative point-of-view for service quality enhancement, this study suggests the airline focusing
on the improvement of the attributes which are identified in the Concentrate Here quadrant by
either IPA or PCM, including Meal service, Complaint response, and Flight on-time and removing
resources from the attributes which are located in the quadrants of Possible Overkill and Low
Priority by both IPA and PCM, including Seat reservation and Cabin facility.
As to the results of DRM, due to the smoothing effect, two attributes (Seat reservation and Cabin
facility) are identified as basic factors and rest attributes are identified as indifference factors. The
results are quite not anticipated. To gain in-depth investigations, analysis was conducted on the
passengers with various journey purposes. As a result, the passengers on business or visit & home
trips view all nine attributes as performance factor; while the passengers on tourism trip rate four
attributes –Seat reservation, Ground service, Cabin facility, and Baggage delivery as excitement
factors and five attributes –Meal service, Cabin service, Complaint response, Flight on-time and
Flight safety, as performance factors, suggesting the necessity of the separated analysis.

of incidents are rather difficult to determine, some algorithms are only validated on simulated traffic
data, thus, their performances in field data have to be further examined. In addition, the California
and the Minnesota filtering algorithms require parameters being calibrated in advance or
subjectively preset, lowering down their transferability. Some algorithms employ (fuzzy) artificial
neural network, a black-box like algorithm, to detect incidents which may lack of possibilities for
examination and post-optimization of trained models, leaving much room for improvement.
In contrast, the genetic fuzzy logic controller (GFLC) can not only self-learn the optimal
combination of fuzzy rules and shapes of membership functions, which can provide such
possibilities, but it also has been proven to have excellent performance in many fields (e.g. Shieh et
al., 2002, Xiong and Litz, 2002, and Chiou and Lan, 2005). However, as to the authors’ best 
knowledge, none of studies have been conducted by applying GFLC to incident detection. Based on
this, the study aims to develop GFLC incident detection models based on field incident cases.
Basically speaking, the core logic of incident detection is to indicate whether an incident occurs by
partially or fully examining the differences of traffic information (including flow, speed and
occupancy) detected by a vehicle detector (VD) between two executive time horizons or detected by
upstream and downstream VDs at the same time horizon. Thus, there are a total of nine commonly
used variables, including the differences of flow, speed and occupancy detected by upstream and
downstream VDs between time t and t-δ, respectively and the differences of flow, speed and
occupancy between upstream and downstream VDs at the time t. However, the potential rules of the
GFLC model will rapidly become enlarged as the number of state variables increases, making it
rather difficult to search a comprising rule combination and representative shapes of membership
function. Taking nine state variables and each with five linguistic degrees for instance, the number
of potential rules equals to 510=1,953,125 and the number of rule combination equals to 21,953,125.
Obviously, it is barely possible to consider al of nine variables simultaneously. That’s why the 
number of state variables is usually less than three in the most of GFLC applications. Thus, this
paper employs two approaches to develop GFLC incident detection models. The first one is to
select partial variables (three out of nine) as state variables of GFLC. The second one employs
principal components technique to extracted factors from original variables as the state variables of
GFLC model with maximum percentage of variable explained. Comparisons among these GFLC
models and an artificial neural network (ANN) model which considers all of nine variables
simultaneously are conducted.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the GFLC model
proposed by Chiou and Lan (2005). Section 3 delineates the solution algorithm of the proposed
model. Section 4 provides the validation and comparisons results based on field incident cases on
Taiwan No.1 freeway. Finally, the concluding remarks and suggestions for future research follow.

2.2 Encoding method for membership function
Consider a triangle fuzzy number and let parameters ckr, ckc and ckl respectively represent the
coordinates of right anchor, cortex and left anchor of kth linguistic degree. Then 15 parameters need
to be calibrated for a variable with five linguistic degrees. Furthermore, it is assumed that the first
and last degrees of fuzzy numbers are left- and right-skewed triangles, respectively and that the
others are isosceles triangles as shown in Figure 5. Therefore, a variable with five linguistic degrees
has eight parameters to be calibrated and their orders are:

where cmax and cmin are the maximum and minimum values of the variable, respectively. The orders
between c5l and c3r, c4 l and c2 r, c3 l and c1 r are indeterminate. In order to tune these eight parameters,
nine position variables r1 ~ r9 are designed as follows:

To achieve two significant digits, each position variable is represented by four real-coding genes
also depicted in Figure 2. The maximum value of the position variables is 99.99 and the minimum
value is 0. Thus, in the example of two state variables and one control variable (each with five
linguistic degrees), the chromosome is composed of 108 genes.
表 Y04 第 50 頁
Consider an FLC with n state variables x1, x2 ,…, xn and one control variable y, each with d1, d2.,…, 
dn and dn+1 linguistic degrees. Note that the number of linguistic degrees of each state variable can
vary. Assume that the membership functions of all linguistic degrees to be triangle-shaped. The
iterative evolution algorithm is structured as follows:
Step 0: Initialization: s=1.
Step 1: Selecting logic rules.
Step 1-1: Generating an initial population with p chromosomes. Each chromosome has


genes, and each gene randomly takes one integer from the interval [0, dn+1].
Step 1-2: Calculating the fitness values of all chromosomes based on incumbent shapes of
membership functions.
Step 1-3: Selection.
Step 1-4: Crossover.
Step 1-5: Mutation.
Step 1-6: Testing the stop condition. The stop condition is set based on whether the mature rate
(the proportion of same chromosome in a population) has reached a given constantη. If
so, proceed to Step 2; otherwise go to Step 1-3.
Step 2: Tuning membership functions.
Step 2-1: Generating an initial population with p chromosomes. Each chromosome has 36(n+1)
genes and each gene randomly takes one integer from the interval [0, 9].
Step 2-2: Calculating the fitness values of all chromosomes based on the incumbent combination
of logic rules.
Step 2-3: Selection.
Step 2-4: Crossover.
Step 2-5: Mutation.
Step 2-6: Testing the stop condition. Let fs be the largest fitness among the population for the sth
evolution epoch. The stop condition is set based on whether the mature rate has reached
a given constantη. If so, proceed to Step 3 and let s=s+1; otherwise go to Step 2-3.
Step 3: Testing the stop condition. If (fs+1 - fs) ≦ε, whereεis an arbitrary small number, then stop.
Incumbent combination of logic rules and shapes of membership functions are the optimal
learning results. Otherwise, go to Step 1.
For simplicity, the numbers of linguistic degrees of all state and control variables are set equally in
this paper.
3. GFLC INCIDENT DETECTION MODELS
3.1 Traffic Information for Incident Detection
Generally speaking, an incident is detected by examining the differences of traffic information,
including volume, speed and occupancy, between two consecutive time horizons or two successive
VDs. According to the literatures, a total of nine variables for incident detection can be defined as
follows:
 Q u ( t ) = Q u ( t ) - Q u ( t -  )
( 1 7 )
 V u ( t ) = V u ( t ) - V u ( t -  )
表 Y04 第 52 頁
makes a total of 125 genes in each chromosome. In tuning membership functions, there are nine
position variables of each variable. That makes a total of 144 genes in each chromosome.
The aim of GAs is to minimize the total error between predicted and real incident information:

where, E is the total sum of squared error. ityˆ and yit are respectively the predicted and real
incident indicator, which are binary variables with the value of 1 representing ith incident occurred
at time click=t and 0, otherwise. I is the total number of incidents T is total number of time clicks
used to detect an incident. In this paper, we examine the traffic information detected during the
period of 5 minutes before and after the time of an incident occurred. With time click=30 seconds,
T=30. The fitness value of GAs is set as f=1/E.
3.3. Performance indexes
Three commonly used performance indices in incident detection are also adopted in this paper,
which are detection rate (DR), false alarm rare (FAR), and mean time to detection (MTD). They are
defined as follows.
DR is defined as the percentage of the number of incident cases correctly detected by the algorithm
to the total number of incident cases known to have occurred. One incident case is said to be
detected, if at least one detection signal is activated during the period of this incident.

where, n is the total number of incident cases being correctly detected. N is the total number of
incident cases known to have occurred. N-n is the total number of incident cases fail to be detected.
FAR is defined as the percentage of the number of false alarm incident cases to the total number of
incident free cases. Similarly to the definition of DR, one incident free case is said to be incorrectly
detected (a false alarm) by the algorithm, if at least one detection signal is activated during the
period of the incident free case.

4.3 Learning Results
The learning process of the Components model with crossover rate=0.7 and mutation rate=0.03 is
depicted in Figure 4. Notice that the E value decreases from 82.92 to 56.08. A total of two iterations
have been elapsed. A total of 117 fuzzy logic rules are selected. However, it is too many to be
interpreted as a whole. Proper reduction of the number of rules selected deserves further study. The
optimally tuned membership functions of four variables are depicted in Figure 5.

We further compare the performances of best performing GFLC models, i.e. the Components model,
and the best performing ANN model. The results are shown in Table 5. Note that the Components
model performs better than ANN model in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate, in contrast,
performs slightly inferior to the ANN model in terms of mean time to detection. In a word, the
Components model is the best performing incident detection model among other GFLC models and
ANN models proposed by this paper.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The paper aims to develop a freeway automatic incident detection model based on genetic fuzzy
logic controller (GFLC) proposed by Chiou and Lan (2005). There are a total of nine commonly
used variables, including the differences of flow, speed and occupancy detected by upstream and
downstream VDs between time t and t- , respectively and the differences of flow, speed andδ
occupancy between upstream and downstream VDs at the time t. Since the number of state
variables of GFLC is strictly constrained to avoid great number of potential logic rules to be
selected, two approaches, partial selection and principal components, are adopted in this paper to
select three state variables. Four GFLC models are developed with partially selecting state variables,
which are the Volume model, the Speed model, the Occupancy model, and the Integration model.
Then the Components model is developed by using the first three principal components extracted
from original nine variables based upon the traffic data of incident cases and incident free cases. To
further demonstrate the performances of proposed GFLC models, a widely applied method in
incident detection, ANN model, is also developed and compared. A total of 30 incident cases and
30 incident free cases with valid traffic information are collected from Taiwan No.1 freeway during
March to August in 2005. A threefold cross-validation method is adopted to train and validate the
models. The results show that the Components model performs slightly inferior to some of GFLC
models in terms of false alarm rate and mean time to detect, but it is the best performing GFLC
model because of its best performance in terms of detection rate which is considered as the most
important performance index of incident detection. To further compare with the ANN model, the
Components model can still perform better in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate, but
perform slightly inferior in terms of mean time to detection. The excellence performance of the
Components model has been proven.
Some directions for future research can be identified. Firstly, the recorded occurrence time of
incidents might be a bit later than their actual time. The time lag might negatively affect the
learning accuracy of incident detection models. To acquire the actual occurrence time of incidents is
essential for automatic incident detection. Secondly, too many invalid traffic data were found and
caused it to be hard to collect enough incidents with sufficient traffic data for training models. Thus,
more incident cases with various degrees of impact to the traffic can be collected to train the models
for being able to detect a wide spectrum of incidents. Besides, due to the difficulty of collecting
various real incident traffic data under various incident types and traffic conditions, using simulated
traffic data for the test of our proposed model maybe a deserving effort. Thirdly, a hybrid model of

material dispatchers’ problems, and its objective is to maximize each local government’s least 
satisfaction (the ratio of collected quantity to anticipated distribution quantity). Relatively, the
lower level presents material demander’s (local government) problems, and its objective is to 
maximize local government’s satisfaction. To verify the feasibility, this research also undertakes a
numerical experiment and solved by simplex method which can serve as a helpful reference for the
central disaster response center to dispatch stockpiles.
2. METHODOLOGIES
2.1 Stackelberg Game
After disaster occurred, the main goal for the stockpiles distributor is to allocate with equity
under the limited resources, however, to come to the maximum satisfaction for the stockpiles
requesters, the quantity of the reasonable needs are always exaggerated, requesters and distributor
make their own decision according to the action with each other, hence, the stockpiles allocation
problem is naturally a Stackelberg game.
The Stackelberg leadership model is a strategic game in economics in which the leader firm
moves first and then the follower firms move sequentially. It is named after the German economist
Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg who published Market Structure and Equilibrium (Marktform
und Gleichgewicht) in 1934 which described the model. In game theory terms, the players of this
game are a leader and a follower and they compete on quantity. The Stackelberg leader is
sometimes referred to as the Market Leader.
In this research, stockpiles distributor and stockpiles requester are seen as the leader and the
follower, respectively. The reason is that distributor owns the right to allocate the relief stuff.
2.2 Extended Kuhn-Tucker approach for linear bi-level programming
Chenggen Shi etc (2007) extended KT condition approach to bi-level programming, let write a
linear programming as follows.

：the cumulative proposed quantity for requester in every time period .
when .
：the satisfaction of requester in every time period .
：the quantity of requester proposed in every time period .
：the quantity of stockpiles dispatched to requester in every time period .
： minimum satisfaction between every requester
To meet the requirement of the maximum equity, distributor expects that the difference of
satisfaction between each requester is minimized, hence, we can treat it as the upper level. The
objective of upper level(leader) is to minimize the difference of satisfaction between requesters,
however, it still has several assumptions as follows:
1. The available quantity at the very beginning equals to stock quantity.
2. The total quantity of available stockpiles equals to the surplus of previous time period and
recruited current time period.
3. It’s not allowed of spare stockpiles when demand is greater than supply, the actual
dispatched quantity has to be the actual demand or the available supply.
4. Demand is great or equal to supply in very time period.
5. The quantity dispatched to requester is less or equal to the available supply.
The objective function of lower level(follower) is to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each
requester, still, there are two assumptions as follows:
1. The quantity of requester proposed must greater or equal to its actual quantity.
2. The actual quantity of requester needed is the quantity at current time period plus the
quantity at previous period which distributor didn’t satisfy to requester.
3.2 Model Formulation
We define the equity as the difference of satisfaction of each requester is even.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK
This study aims to formulate the behavior between the stockpiles distributor and requesters, it
assumes requesters may exaggerate their actual demand to the distributor because of that requesters
anticipate the quantity of stockpiles they will get must less than or equal to the quantity they
declaration, vice versa, stockpiles distributor also doubt the reality of the quantity the requesters
declared, usually, they assume the requester was over declaring. The interaction between the
requesters and distributor becomes a typical Stackelberg game naturally, furthermore, this study
treats distributor as the leader and requesters as the followers, and formulate the interaction to a
bi-level programming. Bi-level programming is hard to solve by its primitive form, hence, extended
KT approach has been adopted to transform the lower level problem(follower) to the constraint
functions of upper level problem, it can be easily solved by any kind of algorithms.
In the above simulated scenario, the proposed model can minimize the difference of satisfaction of
each request to meet the goal of equity, however, stockpiles supply still limited by the stock in any
time period. We also find out that distributor can almost grasp the actual demand of each requester
when the supply is able to meet the demand, that means the satisfaction and equity are almost reach
the expectation. This model illustrates the process of“suspect”and gives the direction to both sides

1. INTRODUCTION
The abrupt reduction of roadway capacity at incident sites can generate manifest shockwaves along
which apparent speed variations are emerged. Such speed variations are due to normal speed traffics
(free-flow phase) joining the gridlock traffics (congested phase), which not only decreases the
roadway throughput capability but also induces accidents occasionally. Recently, different variable
speed-limit (VSL) control algorithms have been proposed to eliminate, or, at least, to reduce the
sizes of such shockwaves. Traditionally, VSL systems are used in planned or anticipated incidents
such as work zones; however, VSL control systems become promising in managing the unexpected
incidents in the contexts of intelligent highway systems wherein advanced VSL signs are densely
placed along the roadways. Therefore, it is a challenging issue to determine the optimal VSL control
schemes for such unexpected incidents along the dense-VSL signs roadways.
In literature, to evaluate the performance of VSL control systems, the following two indexes are
typically used: (1) efficiency, represented by minimizing delay or maximizing throughput (i.e., total
number of vehicles passing through the incident site) during the evaluation period and (2) safety,
represented by minimizing crash potential (Lee et al., 2006) or crash likelihood (Abdey-Aty et al.,
2006). The VSL control algorithms can be roughly divided into microscopic and macroscopic
categories, depending on how traffic features are depicted. In microscopic literature, most VSL
algorithms utilized microscopic traffic simulators with consideration of crash likelihood and
throughput efficiency. For instance, Yadlapati and Park (2004) proposed and evaluated three VSL
control logics at work zones by a microscopic traffic simulator—VISSIM. Lin et al. (2004)
proposed and evaluated two online VSL control algorithms at highway work zones by a
microscopic traffic simulator—CORSIM-RTE. Lee et al. (2004, 2006) examined three VSL control
strategies by using a microscopic traffic simulator—PARAMICS to evaluate the proposed control
logics based on short-term variation of traffic flow characteristics. Abdey-Aty et al. (2005, 2006)
also employed PARAMICS to investigate the changes in crash likelihood function under 12
logically derived VSL control strategies. Kang and Chang (2006) proposed an optimal time-of-day
speed limit control (TOD SL) model with core logic to divide the entire day of operations into a
number of control periods based on historical traffic patterns and to determine an optimal
speed-limit control strategy for accommodating the time-varying traffic conditions within each
control period. The performance of the proposed model, in terms of operational efficiency and
traffic safety, was evaluated by CORSIM. In macroscopic literature, on the other hand, most VSL
algorithms normally utilized macroscopic traffic simulators and focused only on throughput
efficiency because the crash potential due to speed variation and interaction among vehicles can
hardly be analyzed or simulated. For example, Breton et al. (2002) and Hegyi et al. (2005)
respectively proposed a predictive coordinated ramp metering and a VSL model to extend the
control mechanism of ramp metering to increase the outflow, subject to the maximum on-ramp
queue length constraint. A macroscopic traffic simulator, METANET, was used to predict the traffic
demand and to evaluate the model performance.
Enhancement of safety and throughput efficiency should be regarded as the major purposes of
implementing VSL control systems; thus, it is crucial to develop a sophisticated VSL control model
which can simultaneously enhance both indexes or optimally compromise both. Most of the
existing VSL control algorithms, however, have subjectively determined the reduction of speed
limit without any optimization mechanism, thus the performance of speed-limit control cannot be
guaranteed. To remedy the shortcomings, this paper aims to develop a
genetic-fuzzy-logic-controller (GFLC) based model for optimal VSL controls with consideration of
throughput and safety. The GFLC model with an iterative evolution algorithm, proposed by Chiou
and Lan (2005), is employed to optimally determine the reduction of speed limit according to
real-time upstream traffic conditions and severity degrees of incidents. In order to evaluate the
performance of learned logic rules and tuned membership function, this study further revise the cell

2.2 Revised cell transmission model
To facilitate the learning process of the proposed model, an efficient traffic simulator is necessary to
evaluate the performance of a set of selected logic rules and tuned membership functions in a very
short period. Obviously, the learning time of the proposed model will rapidly grow intractably if a
microscopic traffic simulator is used. However, if a macroscopic traffic simulator is adopted, it is
impossible to evaluate the safety index due to the lack of information of interactive behavior among
vehicles. Thus, a mesoscopic traffic simulator can be considered. CTM, proposed by Daganzo
(1994, 1995) to simulate traffic hydrodynamic behavior in a mesoscopic manner, uses several
simple equations to govern traffic movements along the roadway which is represented by a series of
equal-length cells. These equations are expressed as follows:

where, ni(t) represents the number of vehicles in cell i at time t. yi(t) represents the number of
vehicles flowing into cell i at time t. qmi (t) represents the maximum number of vehicles entering
into cell i at time t. Ni(t) represents the maximum number of vehicles stored in cell i at time t. v and
w are the free-flow and shockwave speeds, respectively. The q-k fundamental diagram can be
depicted as Figure 1(a).
In this paper, to facilitate CTM to simulate traffic behaviors at the incident site where the capacity is
reduced and the traffic speed is restricted within the speed limits due to lane-closure, the q-k
diagram is further revised accordingly as depicted in Figure 1(b). As shown in Figure 1(b), jam
density (i.e. maximum storage capacity, Ni(t)) will be reduced from kj to θkj, where θdenotes the
percentage of lanes remained for traffic. For instance, θ= 2/3 indicates one-lane closure on a
three-lane freeway because 1/3 of storage capacity is blocked and unable to store any vehicles.
Furthermore, once partial lanes are closed the capacity (maximum flow rate) will be dropped from
qm toρqm, whereρdenotes the remaining capacity ratio. Table 1 reports theρvalues observed from
field survey in Taiwan. As expected, ρis smaller than θbecause the closely interacted movements
of merging traffics within the incident upstream stretch can further reduce the maximum outflow
rate.

3. VALIDATION OF REVISED CELL TRANMISSIONS MODEL
To validate the revised CTM in replicating the freeway traffic behaviors in Taiwan under various
traffic conditions, five sets of real traffic data were collected from Taiwan’s freeways. The upstream
detected traffic data are set as the input flow of CTM and the detected traffic data at the downstream
site of interest are used to validate the accuracy of the revised CTM. The results are respectively
given below.
(1) Basic segment under free flow: The selected study corridor is located at a three-lane basic
segment from 141+2K to 143+4K southbound (a length of 2.2 km) on Freeway No.3. The
validation result is depicted in Figure 5(a) with a MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) of
0.07.
(2) Weaving segment under free flow: The selected study corridor is located at a three-lane weaving
segment from 174+9K to 177+1K southbound (a length of 2.2 km) on Freeway No.3. The
validation result is depicted in Figure 5(b) with a MAPE of 0.10.
(3) One-lane closure under congested condition: The selected study corridor is located at a
three-lane basic segment from 198+6K to 197+1K northbound (a length of 1.5 km) on Freeway
No.1. An incident occurs at 197+9K causing one-lane closure with duration of approximate 1.3
hours (from 14:00~15:30). The validation result is depicted in Figure 6(a) with a MAPE of 0.12.
(4) Two-lane closure under congested flow: The selected study corridor is located at a three-lane
basic segment from 168+1K to 166+8K northbound (a length of 1.3 km) on Freeway No.1. An
incident occurs at 167+0K causing two-lane closure with duration of approximate 1.1 hours
(from 12:20~13:30). The validation result is depicted in Figure 6(b) with a MAPE of 0.13.
(5) Three-lane closure under congested flow: The selected study corridor is located at a three-lane
basic segment from 110+0K to 113+4K southbound (a length of 3.4 km) on Freeway No.1. An
incident occurs at 111+2K causing three-lane closure with duration of approximate 2.0 hours
(from 11:40~13:40). The validation result is depicted in Figure 6(c) with a MAPE of 0.12.

4.2 Model performance
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, six incident cases occurred on Freeway No.1
were investigated, as shown in Table 2. These incident cases represented slight (one-lane closure),
moderate (two-lane closure), and severe (all-lane closure) incidents under both free-flow and
congested-flow conditions. Their corresponding 1-minute traffic data, including mainline, on-ramp,
and off-ramp within the 15 km upstream stretch of the incident sites, were also collected and used
as the inflows of the revised CTM.

The control performances of the proposed model and the non-VSL (serving as baseline) are
presented in Table 3. Compared with non-VSL control, the proposed model can improve safety (CL)
from 1.02% to 14.49% at no expense or slight decrease of throughput (TT) by only up to 2.24%. In
terms of crash likelihood reduction, the proposed model performs better in the cases of less severe
incidents (e.g. one-lane closure) and under peak hours. It is because that the interactions among
vehicles become more prevalent as traffic volume increases. Lowering the speed limits can
effectively avoid seriously negative interactions among vehicles in different cells. In the cases of
severe incidents with more lanes closure, all upstream cells may exhibit very similar traffic
conditions, i.e. gridlock, soon after the incident occurs. This will make the VLS control less
effective. In addition to the safety enhancement, it is interesting to note that the proposed model did
not deteriorate the throughput (e.g., for three-lane closure under both off-peak and peak hours).
