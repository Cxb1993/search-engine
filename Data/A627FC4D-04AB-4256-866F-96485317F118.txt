Abstract 
     This project focuses on a novel design for power/ground planes. By implementing 
the novel EBG power/ground plane with wide bandgap, simultaneous switching noise 
(SSN) can be dramatically suppressed in omni-direction. The SSN resulting from the 
voltage perturbation degrades the output signal of the biased integrated circuit and leads 
to significant electromagnetic interference (EMI). Using the proposed EBG 
power/ground planes with the wideband bandgap, the RFI immunity for the RF circuits 
can be achieved on system in package, SiP. Ground surface perturbation lattice is 
porposed for replacing the rod with high dielectric constant in photonic crystal 
power/ground planes. The impact of the through hole via design for wide bandwidth is 
verified by equivalent circuit model, full-wave simulation, and measurement results. A 
novel EBG power/ground planes using LPC-EBG with multiple via ground surface 
perturbation lattice (MV-GSPL) is proposed. The MV-GSPL is periodically distributed 
metal patches shorting to the continuous ground plane and can be embedded in a 
coplanar type EBG structure to enhance its stopband. This structure is able to provide 
almost 140% fractional bandwidth without any additional component in a compact unit 
cell area. An efficient 1-D analysis model is also proposed. The 1-D model is able to

1.2 Simultaneous Switching Noises (SSNs) in Power 
Distribution Networks 
     Fig. 1-1 shows a typical scheme of a power distribution network (PDN) for 
integrated circuits. Generally, a power distribution network consists of power/ground 
planes of board-level packages, decoupling capacitors, and voltage regulator circuits. A 
power distribution network delivers power and necessary currents for integrated circuits 
to the integrated circuit connecting to it.  
     Additionally, simultaneous switching noise (SSN) refers to a noise fluctuation or 
voltage glitch generated in digital circuits due to rapid changes in current caused by 
switching of many circuits in the system at the same time [5]. The specific mechanism 
of SSN can be revealed by a CMOS buffer with PDN in Fig. 1-2.  As the CMOS buffer 
  4 
allowed power remains almost constant.  In addition, the suggested on-chip clock 
frequency trend is approximately 8% growth per year. As the forecasted supplied 
voltage is keeping shrinking, steady maximum allowed power suggests a rising 
supply-current trend. The increasing supply current accompanying with growing clock 
frequency implies a serious design dealing with SSN problem.

     The standing waves can be interpreted as the propagating fluctuation voltage of 
SSN inside PDN, causing undesired noise coupling to other circuits or signal lines on 
the board. In addition to coupling problem, the SSN propagating between the 
parallel-plate power/ground planes in package will also act as antenna at the resonant 
frequencies and cause EMI problems. The SSN noise coupling in package system is the 
target issue being studied in this dissertation. 
1.4 Research Contributions 
     The objective of the proposed research is to propose a novel stopband-enhanced 
EBG structure to suppress a wide frequency range of SSN coupling in mixed-signal 
systems. In addition, a C-band low noise amplifier is used which serves as a victim RF 
circuit to study the feasibility of EBG structure in a mixed-signal systems. Three main 
contributions have been achieved in this project. 
     First of all, the concept of ground surface perturbation lattice (GSPL) structure is 
investigated to suppress power noise in the power distribution network. In order to 
expand the bandgap bandwidth, a modified version of GSPL has been proposed. The 
design concept is using multiple vias to connect the patch of the mushroom-like EBG 
structure and the ground plane. Besides the multiple vias concept, the impact of the vias 
position on the stopband has been also investigated in both qualitative and quantitative 
analysis. The physical mechanism for lower and upper bound frequencies of stopband 
  8 
noise coupling from noisy source to LNA. Embedding EBG in the PDN can 
successfully eliminate these resonance modes, reducing noise coupling phenomenon. In 
the die-package measurement and simulation results, almost 50% intentional SSN noise 
is successfully suppressed in the output spectrum of LNA. This demonstration proves 
the noise isolation concept in mixed-signal systems using EBG structures 
1.5 Chapter Organization 
     This report is organized as follows: Chapter 2 reviews some typical solutions to 
suppress SSN coupling, including split power planes method, discrete and embedded 
decoupling capacitors, and electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure.  
     In Chapter 3, a ground surface perturbation lattice (GSPL) structure is 
investigated to suppress power noise in the power distribution network of mixed signal 
circuits. In order to enhance the bandwidth of the noise suppression, the GSPL structure 
is implemented by using multiple vias in the mushroom-like EBG structure. Under the 
concept of multiple vias, the lower and upper bound cutoff frequencies of the bandgap 
are influenced by the position of the vias. An optimum position for the vias is found to 
achieve maximum stopband bandwidth. In this report, the stopband mechanism of 
GSPL structure is investigated and the corresponding equivalent circuit model is 
proposed to quickly predict the lower and upper bound cutoff frequencies. Suitable test 
boards are fabricated and measured to demonstrate the accuracy of the design concept.

2.1 Power Plane Segmentation 
   Power plane segmentation is one of the most conventional methods dealing with 
SSN coupling [7]. This method is performed by isolating sensitive RF/analog circuits 
from noisy digital circuits by splitting the power plan as shown in Fig. 2-1. In some case, 
the ground plane of vulnerable circuits may also be split. This method is quite effective 
below GHz range, nevertheless, may not be functional at high frequencies since 
electromagnetic energy can still couple to the isolated planes without DC shorting paths.

2.3 Electromagnetic Bandgap Structure 
     In recent years, a large amount of research has applied electromagnetic bandgap 
(EBG) structure to suppress the SSN coupling. EBG structure has first drawn attention 
since its ability of suppressing undesired electromagnetic mode transmission and 
radiation in microwave and millimeter waves [10]. The ability can be applied to 
suppress the unwanted surface wave to enhance the gain of antenna [11] or suppress the 
mutual coupling wave between antenna [12]. Other characteristics such as frequency 
selective surface (FSS) to improve the antenna matching of low profile antenna [13] 
make this structure highly attractive 
     The EBG structures are periodic structures that can forbid electromagnetic wave 
to propagate within a certain frequency band. From the view point of electromagnetic 
wave, the EBG structures provide constructive and destructive interference of 
electromagnetic waves so as to create bandgap [14]. From the circuit point of view, this 
behavior can be considered as periodically cascaded series inductance shunt capacitance 
to form a band stop filter [15].

periodic structure [18]. The lower edge of the fundamental stopband ( fL ) can be written

     Furthermore, the stopband of the HIS power/ground layers can be broaden by 
cascading the HIS structures with different size around the board, as shown in Fig. 2-7 
[17]. The larger square patches provide lower stopband frequencies and the stopband of 
small square patch can cover higher frequency ranges. By designing the dimension of 
the cascaded HIS unit cell, properly, it is possible to obtain a wider stopband which 
cover both stopband frequency ranges. It is similar to the concept of cascading filter 
stages to achieve a larger bandwidth.

high impedance surface power/ground layers is that it needs three or four layers, thus 
the fabrication cost may become one of the major concerns.

2.3.2 Coplanar Type EBG Structure 
     Coplanar type EBG is a two-layer EBG structure realized by periodically etching 
either power or ground plane and keeping the other plane solid. The bandgap of 
coplanar EBG structure is obtained by designing the etching pattern of unit-cell to act as 
the periodic structure in microwave circuits. A number of etching pattern have been 
reported including Long Periodic Coplanar- EBG (LPC-EBG) [22], L-bridge EBG [23], 
and Alternating Impedance EBG (AI-EBG) [24] as shown in Fig. 2-9.

where b is the width of unit cell; c is the speed og light.  
     Based on these concepts, a large amount of research has demonstrate improved 
the stopband as shown in Fig. 2-11. The series inductance of unit-cell can be increased 
by meandering bridge pattern between patches of coplanar EBG [26]. The 
hybrid-planar-type EBG [25] structure has been proposed using SMT capacitors and 
inductors to lower the fL of coplanar type EBG. The Artificial Substrate EBG (AS-EBG) 
[28] is proposed using high-DK material and air holes to increase the shunt capacitance 
and shifting the resonating frequency of unit-cell.

(PCPL) [28]. By suitably choosing the pitch and the dimension of the embedded rods, 
the stop band of the PCPL can be designed at frequencies below 10 GHz, where the 
SSN dominantly distributed in the high-speed circuits. Similar to mushroom type EBG 
structure, the PCPL can provide superior SI performance in multi-layer structure. 
Nevertheless, Manufacture cost of high-dielectric constant material is the main concern 
in contrast with other solutions

2.4 Summary 
In this chapter, two conventional solutions to SSN coupling have been surveyed: 
power plane segmentation and decoupling capacitors. These methods show insufficient 
ability to suppress GHz frequency range. To solve this issue, a large amount of research 
about  EBG structure in power/ground planes has been proposed.  Previous works 
reveal the intention of enhancing the EBG stopband to cover the all possible frequency 
range of coupling. Comparison and discussion of stopband-enhanced techniques will be 
drawn in next chapter.

parameters of the GSPL structure are designed as (a, rp, rv, h1, h2, x) = (20 mm, 9 mm, 
0.15 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.5 mm, 3 mm). In addition, the GSPL and the mushroom-like EBG 
structure are with the same dimensions except the number of the vias. The magnitude of 
the transfer scattering parameters S21 and S31 are computed by using a finite integration 
technique based solver. As shown in Fig. 3-2 (a), the fL of the GSPL and the 
mushroom-like EBG structure are 1.344 GHz and 0.692 GHz, respectively; the 
corresponding fH are 3.732 GHz and 1.676 GHz, respectively. 
     By applying the periodic boundary condition to the unit cell, dispersion diagram is 
simulated using the full-wave simulator HFSS. Fig. 3-2 (b) shows the dispersion 
diagrams of the GSPL and the mushroom-like EBG structure. Their bandgap are from 
1.32 GHz to 3.43 GHz for the former and from 0.68 GHz to 1.6 GHz for the latter. They 
are consistent with the S-parameter results shown in Fig 3-2 (a). The absolute bandwidth 
of bandgap formed by the GSPL structure, 2.11 GHz, is wider than that of the 
mushroom-like EBG structure, 0.92 GHz. 
     The electromagnetic behavior of the two structures can be described by using the 
same principles. The main mechanism resulting in difference fL of the GSPL and 
mushroom-like EBG structure is the effective inductance formed by the current path from 
the patch to the ground plane. However the mushroom-like EBG structure has a larger

     Fig. 3-6 shows spatial distribution of |Ey| on the ground plane at the 
corresponding fH of the GSPL structure with different x. The equivalent cavity identified 
by the dashed circle in the Fig. 3-6(c) are formed among the patches for the case x = 5

the edge toward the center of the patch. Unfortunately, the upper bound frequency of the 
GSPL is not in proportion with x. The fH becomes higher because of the smaller 
equivalent cavity formed inside the patch as x changes from 0 mm to 3 mm. However, if 
x keeps increasing larger than 3 mm, the fH becomes lower due to the larger equivalent 
cavity formed among the patches. The highest fH is presented in the case x = 3 mm. 
Fractional bandwidth (FBW), defined as the ratio of the bandwidth to the center 
frequency, is also plotted in the figure with respect to x. The four vias located neither at 
the edge nor at the center of the patch presents the highest fractional bandwidth of the 
GSPL structure. The maximum FBW is presented in the case x = 4 mm. As a result, to 
find out the parameter x of GSPL structure with maximum fractional bandwidth, a 
method for predicting both fL and fH has to be developed.  
     On the other hand, it is worth noting that the case x = 9 mm represents the 
mushroom-like EBG structure. The maximum fractional bandwidth of the GSPL and 
the mushroom-like EBG structure are 90% and 80% under the same size assumption, 
respectively. It is worth emphasizing that not only absolute bandwidth but also 
fractional bandwidth is enhanced by GSPL structure. 
3.2 Equivalent Circuit Model for Bandgap Prediction 
     The one-dimensional dispersion relation of the periodic structure can be analyzed 
by using a one-dimensional equivalent circuit model with the periodic boundary

is comprised of a three layer stack-up (power plane, patch, and ground plane) and four 
vias. The section consisting of power plane and the patch can be regarded as a lower 
impedance transmission line and modeled as a capacitor CB. The vias are used to connect 
the patch to the ground plane, the current path from the patch to the ground plane through 
four vias behaves inductively and is modeled as an inductor LB.

results from full wave simulator are also shown in this figure to examine the accuracy of 
the developed equivalent circuit model. It is shown that the stopband prediction of the 
GSPL with respect to x is consistent with the results simulated by a full wave simulator. 
 
3.3 Experimental Results  
To verify the accuracy of the design concepts for bandwidth enhancement based on 
vias arrangement, measured results are needed to be compared to numerically simulated 
one. A test vehicle including GSPL structure, mushroom-like EBG structure, and 
reference board has been manufactured by using FR4 PCB fabrication. The relative  
  42 
60 mm by 60 mm with 3 by 3 unit cells. The geometric parameters of the GSPL and 
mushroom-like EBG test vehicles (a, rp, rv, h1, h2) = (20mm, 9 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.5 
mm) are the same. Two test ports are set at (2 mm, 2 mm) and (57 mm, 40 mm). 
For the PCB fabrication, the vias connecting the patches to the ground plane are 
plated through-hole (PTH) vias instead of blind vias or buried vias because of cost 
considerations. However, to maintain the DC voltage level of power plane, clearances are 
used to isolate the power plane from the plated through-hole vias. Fig. 3-13(a) also shows 
the clearances and the fed-in pad on the power plane. The simulation results of the GSPL 
structure implemented by PTH vias and blind vias are shown in Fig. 3-13(b). It is 
illustrated that the two kinds of structures do not have any significant impact on the 
electrical properties in the frequency range of interest. 
The parameter |S21| representing the noise coupling coefficient is measured by 
using an Agilent N5230A vector network analyzer and Cascade Microtech microprobes 
(ground-signal-ground with 350 μm pitch) on a microprobe station. Fig. 3-14 shows the 
simulated and measured results and they are compared in Fig. 3-15 by means of the 
feature selective validation (FSV) technique [30]-[32]. Although there is about 20 dB 
difference between the measured |S21| and the simulated one in the bandgap, the measured 
|S21| is at the level about -80 dB near the noise floor of the measurement equipment. 
It is worthy to note that the measured data are consistent with the simulated ones.

that fL shifts downward from 1. 6 GHz to 1 GHz as x increase from 0 mm to 8 mm. The fH 
of the GSPL structure with x = 3 mm is 3.5 GHz. It presents the highest fH than others. The 
accuracy of the design concept for GSPL discussed in section 3-2 is also confirmed. 
Besides, to compare the |S21| of GSPL structure with that of reference board, the GSPL 
power/ground plane provides over 30 dB of noise isolation in the bandgap. 
Fig. 3-16 shows the simulated |S11| and normalized radiation loss for the GSPL test 
board with x = 3 mm, where the material loss for the substrate and metal are assumed zero 
in the full-wave simulation. The magnitude of the reflection coefficient at port 1 is very 
close to unity in the bandgap from 1.4 GHz to 3.5 GHz. In addition, the normalized 
radiation loss, defined as 1−|S11|
2−|S21|
2
, is below 5% within the bandgap. It implies that 
the power noise within the bandgap is almost reflected at the input port and absorbed by  
  46 
qualitative and quantitative analysis. The physical mechanism for lower and upper bound 
frequencies of stopband have been given. It has been found there is an optimum position 
for the vias to achieve the maximum fractional bandwidth of the stopband. The equivalent 
circuit model of GSPL structure has been proposed to well predict the lower and upper 
bound cutoff frequencies of bandgap. The test vehicles with plated through-hole vias on 
the FR4 substrate have been designed, manufactured and measured. The agreement 
between simulated, modeled, and measured results is good. Under the same fabrication 
process, the bandwidth of the stopband of GSPL structure is enhanced from 0.92 GHz to 
2.11 GHz compared with the mushroom-like EBG structure. And the fractional 
bandwidth is also improved from 80 % to 90%. The GSPL structure has been proven to be 
an excellent and feasible solution for noise coupling isolation in multilayer 
PCBs/packages for mixed signal circuit design.

like EBG is shorted to ground with only one via at the center of patch. Fabricated in the 
same substrate-thickness and patch-size, MV-GSPL tends to possess stopband compared 
with mushroom type EBG. The shifting cut-off frequencies result from the lower 
via-inductance [33].   
A novel EBG power/ground planes is constructed by combing MV-GSPL with a 
LPC-EBG. Fig. 4.1 shows the embodiment view of a 3 × 3 unit-cells LPC-EBG 
power/ground pair with MV-GSPL. It is a three layer periodic structure. The top layer is 
a LPC-EBG pattern [22]. It consists of a square pad with bridges on the four sides. The 
adjacent cells are connected through the bridges. The bottom layer is a solid ground 
plane. The MV-GSPL is on middle layer with multiple vias to the solid ground plane.

hand, the fH of LPC-EBG is increased because the MV-GSPL may dominate the 
unit-cell cavity resonance. The resonance happens at the cavity formed by MV-GSPL’s 
patch and etched power layer. Since this cavity is smaller than original LPC-EBG unit 
cell, making fH higher. This idea can be demonstrated by examining the electric field 
distribution for a unit-cell. Fig. 4-3(a) and (b) show the patterns of electric field 
distribution of second-order mode of LPC-EBG only and the LPC-EBG with MV-GSPL 
obtained by numerical tool HFSS. It can be shown that the peak strength is around the 
etched pattern due to the self-resonance of unit-cell but near the center of the unit-cell 
for LPC-EBG with MV-GSPL. Therefore, the cavity formed by square patch of 
MV-GSPL at the second layer and the LPC-EBG on top layer may determine fH.

4.2 Proposed One Dimensional Equivalent Circuit Model 
4.2.1 ABCD Matrix and Periodic Boundary Condition (PBC) 
     The EBG power/ground planes are usually characterized by examining its 
transmission behavior (|S21|), or calculating its dispersion diagram which represents the 
relationship between the frequency and wave vector of the propagating wave. Waves 
within EBG power/ground planes scatter in a two dimensional way which must may 
involve two dimensional dispersion diagrams to determine stopband. Two dimensional 
dispersion diagram can be calculated by reduced Brillouin zone of a unit cell [15], as 
shown in Fig. 4-5. Three vectors, directing from Γ to Χ, Χ to Μ and Μ to Γ 
can fully describe all possible wave directions in two dimensionally distributed periodic 
structure.

From equation (4-12), we have the relationship of the wave vector versus frequency of 
the propagating wave in the periodic structure. Fig. 4-8 shows a typical dispersion 
diagram of a periodic EBG structure calculated by (4-12). 
     As can been seen in Fig. 4-8, the relation between frequency and wave vector 
determines traveling behavior of electromagnetic waves within the periodic EBG 
structure. The pass-band is defined as the frequency region with real  , while the 
stop-band is defined as the opposite. The frequency regions with real   solutions 
represent the possibility of propagating waves.

enough to deal with each part of unit cell and able to maintain each circuit electrically 
small. For the sake of efficiency, the stopband of proposed structure is calculated by 
separately evaluating fL and fH: 
(1) fL is obtained by using the method stated in 4.2.1, but with a simplified   
one-dimensional equivalent circuits and PBC. 
(2) fH is obtained by using another complete one-dimensional equivalent circuits, 
in which more segmenting works are involved than the simplified mode.  
     Since fH is determined by the cavity resonance of unit-cell, it can be predicted by 
calculating the complete equivalent circuits' first resonance frequency. That is, fH is the 
first input impedance peak of the complete equivalent circuit, which can be  
estimated by conventional SPICE-based circuit simulators. 
     The unit-cell is decomposed into two sections denoted by A and B as shown in 
Fig. 4-9. Section A represents the conductor-back coplanar waveguide (CB-CPW) with

4.3 Fabrication and Measurements 
     The accuracy of the proposed model is first verified using full-wave simulation 
(HFSS). The fL  and fH of those five type of via patterns in Fig. 4-4 are calculated both 
by the equivalent model and the full-wave simulation. The dimensions of the unit-cell 
and their corresponding L and C values are listed in Table 4-1. It is noted that the Lone, 
Ltwo and Lthree in Table. 4-1 are calculated through the method stated in previous section 
and  can be selectively substituted into Lv1 or Lv2 of the corresponding via patterns. Fig. 
4-15 shows the comparison of bandgap prediction results between full-wave simulation 
and proposed model. As can be seen in Fig. 4-15, the stopband (between fL and fH ) of 
the five cases can be fairly predicted using proposed model.  
     In addition to the accuracy information, Fig. 4-15 also indicates that the proposed 
model is capable of predicting the ascent of fH as the number of via increased and there 
is little deviation between different via patterns sharing the same number of via. In all 
the via patterns, the 8-via possesses the highest fH, conforming the design concept 
mentioned 
  70 
 
         8 via         5-via-2       5-via-1       4-via-2       4-via-1 
Fig. 4-15  Comparison of predicted stopband between simulation and proposed model  
 
and 8-via. The geometric parameters are the same as shown in Table 4-1. The board size 
is 60 mm by 60 mm containing 3 by 3 unit-cells. Two ports insertion loss measurements 
are conducted and compared with model-predicted results to validate the accuracy of the 
model. Fig. 4-16 shows the fabricated board 8 via case and its measured  
port- locations. All three cases are measured at the same locations using SMA 
connectors. 
     Fig. 4-17 shows the measurement results marked with model-predicted stopband 
bandwidth of three EBG boards. According to the measurement results from DC to 5 
GHz, the stopband bandwidth of three cases may be well predicted using proposed 
model. Again, Fig. 4-17 shows that there is a steady increase trend of fH as the number 
fH 
fL 
  72 
4.4 Parameter Analysis 
     Parameter analysis is conducted to understand the relationship between some 
critical design parameters and stopband bandwidth, thus allows designers to adjust the 
stopband bandwidth in an optimized way. Using the proposed model, the stopband 
bandwidth can be predicted faster than full-wave simulation and making the analysis 
efficient.  
     The parameter analysis are conducted through fixing the via pattern and adjusting 
other geometric parameters. The 8-via pattern is chosen here as an example. Two 
geometric parameters are selected: the width of square patch w and the normalized 
lattice thickness defined as 2 1 2( )t t t . The width of square patch is discussed because 
it may affect both fL and fH. In addition, the thickness ratio is discussed since it is a 
critical geometric specification that designers are required to implement EBG in a 
particular package substrate.  
     Fig. 4-18 shows the analysis results containing the trends of fL and fH as varying w 
and thickness ratio. The parameter w is normalized to unit-cell size a for design 
convenience. As can be seen in Fig. 4-18(a), decreasing w/a from 0.8 to 0.5 can move fH 
to higher. It is resulted from the dominant cavity resonance formed by the smaller 
MV-GSPL. However, this phenomenon may not continue if w/a is keeping shrinking 
from 0.5 to 0.4, because other parts of unit-cell, such as capacitance between LPC-EBG

4.5 Summary 
The novel EBG power/ground planes using MV-GSPL with LPC-EBG structure 
is presented alone with the modeling technique in this chapter. The proposed modeling 
technique is developed in order to have a faster prediction of the stopband than full 
wave simulation.  The feature of the proposed structure is that the higher edge of 
stopband (fH) may be shifted to higher frequency by decreasing the via inductance. 
It is found that the proposed modeling technique fairly predict the fH by 
computing the first input impedance peak of the one-dimensional complete model, and 
adding the inductance resulted from the assumed longitudinal currents to the via 
inductance. Although the modeling technique does not provide direct formula 
associated with designing fH, it may offer an approach to model multiple vias in similar 
structures [33]. 
In summary, some typical and recently-developed EBG structure are listed in 
Table 4-2 to be compared with the stopband of the proposed structure. The techniques 
involved additional elements such as high dielectric constant materials are marked with 
star symbols. As depicted in Table 4-2, although coplanar type EBG such as LPC-EBG 
provides over 100 BW(%), the unit size is much larger than any other kinds of structure. 
In this work, proposed structure has much compact size than coplanar type EBG and 
possesses comparable BW(%) without any other additional elements.

Application Study for EBG  
Power/Ground Planes in Mixed Signal 
System 
     Several previous works on PDNs with EBG structure to PDNs have usually 
considered the frequency responses of EBG structures by doing the insertion loss 
simulation or measurements. For better understanding of the noise-suppression ability 
of EBG structures in a realistic mixed-signal system, an application case study is 
demonstrated on an RF-SiP substrate with a C-band low noise amplifier (LNA). The 
under-test C-band LNA servers as a sensitive RF circuit in a mixed-signal system 
suffering from undesired power noise coupling. In this chapter, the C-band LNA under 
tested is introduced in the first section. In the second section, two types of package 
substrates are designed as the test off-chip PDNs to investigate the power integrity 
performance: a simple parallel plate power/ground pair (reference substrate) and a 
proposed EBG structure (EBG substrate). In the third section, the power integrity of the 
complete (off-chip and on-chip) PDNs and the influences of power noise on the LNA's 
spectrum are investigated. In the fourth section, the influences of power noise on the 
LNA's spectrum are examined in measurements supported. In the last section, summary 
is drawn including a table of measurement results.

     Fig. 5-4 depict the chip photo of C-band LNA. Vg1, Vg2 and Vd  represent the 
biasing pads on die for the gate of M1, the gate and drain of M2, respectively. On-chip 
bypass capacitors are connected to power lines between Vg2, Vd and M2. The 
input/output pad sets are lied at two opposite sides of LNA. Each is composed by one 
signal pad and two ground pads for ground-signal-ground GSG probing measurements. 
5.2 Design and Fabrication of Power Distribution Networks 
(PDN) 
     Two package substrates are fabricated in a four-layer FR4 process to supply DC 
bias voltages for the LNA: a simple parallel plate power/ground pair (reference 
substrate) and a proposed EBG structure (EBG substrate). The substrate thickness and 
the arrangement of layers of two packages are shown in Fig. 5-5(a) and (b).

DC power supply plus a high-frequency signal. The high-frequency signal is launched 
from a signal generator and is assumed as SSN noise coupling to Vdd. Fig. 5-6(b) shows 
ports locations of the noise coupling paths. P1 represent the location of SMA, while P2 
and P3  represent two metal pads on signal layer connecting to biasing pads Vg2 and Vd 
through bond-wires.   As the noise is injected at the SMA port, it may propagate 
within power/ground planes due to cavity resonance. The propagating noise may then 
couple to the LNA through bond-wires, thus affecting the performance of LNA. 
     The propose EBG power/ground planes consists of 4 by 4 proposed EBG 
unit-cells with geometrical parameters (a, w, t1 , t2, b, s, p1, p2, g1, g2)=(10, 0.127, 0.508, 
4.5, 2.25, 0.5, 0.5, 9, 0.5, 0.5 ), and (rv, ra) = (0.3048, 0.5588).

resistance can save Vg2 from power supply noise without disturbing biasing voltage level 
since there is no current flow into the gate of transistor.  
Fig. 5-8 shows the insertion loss S21 between P1 and P2 only considering the 
package effect. Both measurement and simulation are presented for reference and EBG 
substrates. The simulation is done by commercial tool of HFSS based on the finite 
element method. The agreement between measurement and simulation is reasonably 
good. It is seen the power noise coupling is significant for the reference board at 
frequencies 1.7 GHz, 3.2 GHz, 4.0 GHz, and 5.4 GHz due to the cavity resonance.  
Compared with the reference substrate, it is seen that the proposed MV-GSPL 
EBG structure could efficiently suppress the noise in wide stopband from 1.8 GHz to 
6.5 GHz. The measured insertion loss can reach about -30 dB for the EBG substrate 
around the C band. The insertion loss S31 between P1 and P3 is similar to S21 and, thus, 
not shown here.

5.4 Measurement Results of LNA under SSN Coupling 
     Using the two substrate package, measurements are conducted through setup as 
shown in Fig. 5-13. The bias-T circuit is used to feed a single tone noise to the DC 
voltage Vdd provided by a DC power supply. The 0 dBm single tone noise is provided by 
a signal generator with center frequency at 5.59 GHz and 5.61 GHz. A 5.6 GHz, -30 
dBm single tone signal is applied to the LNA as a desired signal. The output spectrum 
of LNA is examined when the noise is being fed. The measurements are conducted on a 
probe station with 100 um GSG probes as shown in Fig. 5-14.

simulations. From Fig. 5-15 to 5-16, almost 50% noise suppression is achieved. This 
experiment demonstrates that the proposed EBG have good noise isolation ability 
within its stopband and is able to block the noise from the power distribution network to 
have good signal integrity performance.

Conclusion 
 
     This project has proposed a novel EBG power/ground plane using LPC-EBG with 
MV-GSPL structure. which has almost 140 BW(%) without any additional elements. 
     A one-dimensional analysis model to predict the proposed structure is presented. 
This model is able to consider the number of via in the structure, which may influence 
the stopband in a significant way. The proposed model is successfully verified through 
both measurements and simulations. Design curves are constructed to further discuss 
how other design parameters affect the stopband.  
     Moreover, a C-band LNA is designed as a test die to perform power integrity 
study in mixed-signal system on MV-GSPL and reference substrate. From the analysis 
of total PDNs formed by each of these two package substrate, Embedding EBG in PDN 
can successfully eliminate the resonance modes of PDN. In the simulations and 
measurements of the operating LNA, almost 50 % intentional SSN noise are 
successfully suppressed in the output spectrum of LNA. This demonstration proves the 
ability of proposed EBG structure to noise isolation concept in mixed-signal systems.

The tooth-shaped compartment shielding is shown in Fig. 
1(a), which is composed of an L-type structure with a 
protruding space. The L-type structure is essential due to the 
mechanical stress. The protruding space is increased for the 
automatic assembly. The side view of the structure is shown 
in Fig. 1(b), where the total height of the structure is ht, the 
tooth height is ht-h, the tooth width is Wtooth and the period of 
the tooth-shaped structure is Wperiod. After the proposed 
structure is assembled, the only path for intra-system noise 
coupling to the other side is just between the teeth. Based on 
the shielding theory [5], we know that the smaller the aperture, 
the better the SE. The reason why we choose a tooth-shaped 
metal frame rather than a completely sealed one is that it 
possesses an extra feature, which is able to fix the metal frame 
while assembling. The dense of the tooth in this structure is 
defined as a factor called the filling ratio (FR) as follows:

                        (1) 
 
In this work, FR of the compartment shielding structure is 
chosen 0.6.  
B. Test Vehicle Design 
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
structure, a circuit which supplies a near-field coupled noise is 
required. Although the approach to estimate the characteristic 
of the compartment shielding in a real SiP module is the best 
way, it is too expensive for exploring a new technology. 
Therefore, a substitute test vehicle is necessary. To the best of 
our knowledge, the one-port test vehicle has been designed 
with lower unintended radiated noise to evaluate the 
performance of conformal shielding. The conception can be 
extended to design a two-port test vehicle. Similarly with [1], 
the test vehicle consists of two parts. One is the DUT; the 
other is the evaluation board (EVB). The DUT is designed to 
estimate the efficiency of the proposed structure and the EVB 
is a load board for it. The following section will introduce the 
DUT and EVB boards. 
1)  DUT board 
Fig. 2 is the stackup of the DUT. The dielectric constant of 
the substrate is 4.7. It consists of four metal layers and the 
thickness of substrate from top to bottom is 60um, 300um, and 
60um, respectively. Some guard traces are located at the 
periphery and the middle of the top layer to separate the DUT 
to two spaces. Subsequently, two matched microstrip lines are 
designed at each space of the top layer. They are routed as 
close as possible to generate a large intra-system coupled 
noise. Moreover, in Fig. 3, based on coupled line theory [6], 
the coupled port will receive more power than the isolated 
ports. Thus, the tightly backward coupled line is employed as 
the worst case. Two ports are set at the diagonal corners to 
avoid the unwanted coupling noise passing from ports directly. 
Thus, the top view of the DUT is drawn in Fig. 4.  
Except for the top layer, other layers are ground planes. 
Therefore, intensive ground vias are utilized to eliminate the

there exists a linear relation between the input and output 
power. Therefore, the received power is able to be moved 
away from the noise floor by tuning the input power of the 
signal generator; in other words, the tiny coupled noise could 
be measured accurately when the input power is appropriately 
adjusted.  
B. Comparison Results 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed compartment 
shielding structure, SE is defined as the equation (2), which is 
the received power ratio of the DUT board with and without 
the shield.

A 3-dimensional (3D) model is built by the commercial 
software, Ansoft HFSS. The results of the test vehicle without 
and with the compartment shielding are shown in Fig. 9 and 
Fig. 10, respectively. Subsequently, the SE of the proposed 
compartment shielding structure is calculated from these two 
diagrams and are drawn in Fig. 11. In these diagrams, the 
measured results of both approaches are compared with the 
simulated one. 
    The possible reason for the discrepancy in Fig. 10 is 
explained as follow. Because the efficiency of the 
compartment shielding is excellent, the unwanted noise 
outside the DUT easily dominate measured results. The 
uncertain noise is caused by manufacturing errors, such as the 
transition between the DUT and EVB or the stability of the 
process of the conformal shielding. They are not considered in 
the 3D model. However, the isolation after assembling the 
proposed structure is over 80 dB and it provides 
approximately 30 dB SE by measurement, which is good 
enough at industrial applications. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a mold-based compartment shielding 
structure is proposed to isolate the intra-system noise coupling 
in SiP modules. A test vehicle is designed with lower 
unintended noise to evaluate the SE and two approaches are 
suggested to measure the SE of the proposed structure. One is 
VNA, the other is the signal generator with the spectrum 
analyzer. Because the shield provides an excellent isolation 
performance, such a small signal is difficult to measure and 
easily affected by other noise. Although, there is a 
discrepancy between the simulation and measurement results, 
approximately 30 dB SE by measurement is good enough for 
commercial applications, such as handheld devices and 
wireless connectivity modules.

substrate or PCB by designing an open stub with shorting via 
connecting to the reference plane. Without requiring 
additional decoupling or filter-type components, this method 
provides the shorting path for the return current of common-
mode at GHz range and still maintains the isolation at DC 
level.  
II. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AND EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL 
A. Proposed Structure 
Figure 2 shows the proposed structure. A two-layer test 
board with length of Lgnd and width of Wgnd is taken into 
account. The height of substrate is H and the relative 
permittivity of the dielectric is εr. A slot with width Ws 
horizontally cuts the reference (bottom) plane, remaining the 
distance of Le to the right side. Meanwhile, the differential 
line with width of W and spacing of S asymmetrically cross 
the slotline with distance of Lo and Ls to the open-end and 
short-end of the slotline, respectively. Two ground resonators 
with respective distance of Sgro and Sgrs to the center of 
differential line is implemented. The ground resonators with 
width of Wgrs(o) and length of Lgrs(o) are fabricated in typical 
package or PCB process and two shorting vias are used to 
connect these open stubs to one side of slotline.  
The proposed idea is based on the method of impedance 
matching by placing the two asymmetrical ground resonators. 
By suitably adjusting the length or the width (characteristic 
impedance) of the ground resonators, the pole of common-
mode transmission can be easily relocated to the desired 
frequency, which can greatly reduce the radiation excited by 
the antenna-like slotline. This mechanism will be discussed in 
the following. 
B. Establishment of Equivalent Circuit Model 
The equivalent circuit model of the solution board, which 
includes the proposed structure, is established to characterize 
the transmission of common-mode as shown in Fig. 3(a) and 
3(b). Since the slotline is known as a dispersive medium, the 
frequency dependence of the characteristic impedance Z0s and 
phase constant βS of the slot line are taken into account [12]. 
As shown in Fig. 3(a), two identical transmission lines with 
distance of Lgnd/2 is connected in series with an input 
impedance of Zinc. The Zinc can be formulated as 
 
|| ,inc ino insZ Z Z                            (1) 
 
where Zino and Zins is the input impedance at the left and right 
slotline beneath the center of differential line, respectively. 
As to further understand the interaction of the integrated 
ground resonators, lossless transmission lines are used to 
characterize their influences as shown in Fig. 3(b). Since Zinc 
is determined by the value of Zino and Zins in parallel, the input 
impedance Zino and Zins must be derived.  Zino can be expressed 
as

 , which indicates the magnitude of material and radiation loss. 
If the material loss is neglected, Ln can be used to evaluate the 
strength of the electromagnetic radiation caused by the 
common-mode noise. Comparing the normalized total loss of 
the solution board with that of reference board, the reduction 
of Ln over 0.1 is from 2.15 to 3.31 GHz for simulation results 
and from 2.21 to 3.2 GHz for measurement results. This is 
mainly caused by the decrease of the Zinc for the solution 
board in that frequency range, which is similar to the effective 
bandwidth predicted by the equivalent circuit model. 
B. Reduction of Electromagnetic Radiation 
To show the suppression on radiation by the added ground 
resonator, the simulation results by full-wave simulator [13] 
are used to validate. The maximum electric field considering 
XY, YZ, and XZ planes at 10 meters are of interest and the 
common-mode input power is 0 dBm. The results are recorded 
from 1 to 5 GHz for both cases as shown in Fig. 6. Comparing 
the simulated maximum E-field of the solution board with the 
one of reference boards, the frequency range with at least 5 dB 
reduction is clearly observed from 2.34 to 3.55 GHz and the 
corresponding fraction bandwidth is 41.1%. The frequency 
range is reasonably consistent with the passband for the 
common-mode transmission shown in Fig. 5(b) and, thus, 
verifies the effectiveness of proposed method. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
A novel idea using a pair of the open-stubs asymmetrically 
placed on the slotted ground plane effectively provides the 
shorting path for the common-mode noise during the critical 
frequency range. The proposed equivalent circuit model can 
quickly characterize the common-mode transmission without 
time-consuming full-wave simulation. In order to demonstrate 
the suppression on electromagnetic radiation by utilizing the 
integrated ground resonator, the simulation and experimental 
results are both used to validate its effectiveness. Both the 
bandwidth evaluated by the decrease of the normalized total 
loss and the reduction of maximum electric field are 
consistent with the one predicted by the proposed equivalent 
circuit model, which is from 2.11 to 3.31 GHz. Therefore, the 
proposed idea can actually provide a low-cost and efficient 
way to suppress the EM radiation problems when high-speed 
differential signals inevitably cross the slotted reference plane.

differential feeding scheme is adopted to reduce the area of 
the essential transition in single-ended signalling. The 
parameters for the quasi-Yagi antenna are given in Table I. 
This antenna is simulated in electromagnetic simulator HFSS. 
The quasi-Yagi antenna is designed around 3.8 GHz and the 
simulation result of the differential-mode return loss is shown 
in Fig. 2. It can be observed that the differential-mode return 
loss is over 10 dB. Two different radiation patterns of the 
antenna are shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). One simulation 
result is obtained as the antenna is only excited by differential-
mode signal. The other is attained when the quasi-Yagi 
antenna is interfered with the common-mode noise. The input 
common-mode noise power is one-tenth of the input 
differential-mode signal power. The E-plane and H-plane 
results of the antenna at 3.8 GHz are shown in Fig. 3(a) and 
Fig. 3(b), respectively.  From Fig. 3(a), it can be observed that 
the radiation pattern is disturbed by the common-mode noise 
and the asymmetrical co-polarization radiation pattern is 
generated. The direction of peak gain is altered and the null of 
the radiation pattern is also affected. In Fig. 3(b), the amount 
of the cross-polarization is raised from -43 dB to -21 dB, but 
the co-polarization radiation pattern is slightly affected by the 
common-mode noise. When the common-mode noise is 
extremely raised in RF system, it will significantly change the 
direction of the peak gain and increase the unwanted cross-
polarization level. 
III. NEW FEEDING SCHEME 
A. Proposed balanced filter 
To prevent the antenna from interference of the common-
mode noise, a balanced filter is presented. Under the 
differential-mode excitation, the balanced filter should exhibit 
bandpass frequency response. A bandpass filter with ideal J-
inverters is shown in Fig. 4(a). To implement the J-inverters, a 
π-type inductance network is shown in Fig. 4(b). The required 
inductance with respect to the J-inverter value is given

transmission line stub due to the PEC symmetrical plane. The 
simulation results of the differential-mode insertion loss from 
HFSS agree with the measurement results and it is shown in 
Fig. 6. Only a slight deviation is observed and it may be 
caused by the tolerance of the fabrication process. The 
differential-mode insertion loss of the balanced filter is about 
2.71 dB and the return loss is around 13 dB in measurement 
results.  
For the common-mode excitation, a perfect magnetic 
conductor (PMC) symmetry plane is appeared and stopband 
frequency response is obtained due to the MIM capacitance 
and the inductance of the shorting via between the patch and 
ground plane. The stopband mechanism of the mushroom 
structure has been verified in [12]. The shorting via can be 
properly chosen to adjust the suppression frequency region. 
To have a stopband around the differential-mode passband, 
the required inductance can be achieved by a straight via. Fig. 
6 shows the simulation and measurement results of the 
common-mode insertion loss. The agreement between the two 
results is observed. The shift of the stopband region may be 
caused by the multilayer fabrication tolerance. The height of 
the substrate from the fabricated structure is smaller than the 
simulated one. Therefore, the measured suppression region is 
moved to the lower frequency region. The balanced filter 
exhibits good capability of common-mode suppression, and 
the rejection level is below -40 dB around the differential-
mode passband. By virtue of the good common-mode 
suppression ability and bandpass frequency response under 
the differential-mode operation, this balanced filter is suitably 
to prevent the antenna from the interference of common-mode 
noise.  
B. Performance of the proposed feeding scheme 
In order to suppress the common-mode noise, the proposed 
balanced filter is inserted before the noise coupled to the 
antenna. The schematic of the quasi-Yagi antenna and 
balanced filter is shown in Fig. 7. The proposed balanced filter 
is inserted into the input of the antenna. Since the proposed 
balanced filter can significantly reduce the common-mode 
noise around 3.8 GHz, it will not affect the radiation pattern of 
the antenna. The input common-mode noise power is the same 
as Section II, which is one-tenth of the differential-mode 
signal power. Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b) demonstrates the E- and 
H-plane with co-polarization and cross-polarization of the 
antenna radiation pattern, respectively. The solid line 
represents the radiation patterns of the antenna with the 
balanced filter and the dash line is the results of the antenna 
without the balanced filter. From Fig. 8(a), the symmetrical 
radiation pattern is obtained and the direction of the peak gain 
of the antenna is not affected because of the suppression of 
common-mode noise. The cross-polarization is minimized 
below -30 dB. In Fig. 8(b), the peak gain of the antenna is 
lowered due to the differential-mode loss of the balanced filter. 
However, the cross-polarization level is extremely reduced 
over 25 dB in the H-plane of the radiation pattern.

Abstract—A novel compact common mode choke is proposed 
and realized without using ferrite materials. It is fabricated on 
LTCC substrate and possesses a small size of 1.2 mm   2.0 mm. 
It provides over 10 dB common mode suppression from 1.4 GHz 
to 3.7 GHz and still maintains the differential signal transmission 
up to 8 GHz. To validate the common mode choke on USB 3.0 
cable, a series of experimental tests are executed, including eye 
diagram for differential signal, common mode noise suppression, 
and elimination of common mode current on cables. The eye 
diagram for the filter board keeps obvious eye width and eye 
height and almost the same result with that for the reference 
board. About 57 % common mode suppression is achieved after 
placing the common mode filter on the board with 8 mm skew 
line. Moreover, the common mode current on cables related to 
far field radiation is also measured by current probe and 
eliminated over 10 dB within designed stopband by using the 
common mode choke.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Differential signaling predominates in high-speed digital 
circuits due to its high immunity to noise, crosstalk, and 
electromagnetic interference (EMI). Differential interfaces, 
such as HDMI, USB3.0, PCI-E II, and SATA III, can support 
differential signals transmission up to Gb/s. Ideally, it 
transmits balanced differential signals from transceivers to 
receivers. However, in practical circuits, the differential traces 
may meet imbalances and unwanted common mode noise will 
be induced [1]. These imbalances may include unbalanced 
digital signal output, asymmetrical routing, bends, crosstalk, 
and discontinuities from connectors. These will result in 
unwanted common mode noise coupling to radiators and 
cause serious electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio 
frequency interference (RFI) problems [2]. Therefore, to 
prevent common mode noise from causing radiation becomes 
an essential issue for solving this kind of electromagnetic 
compatibility (EMC) problems. 
Compensation structures and common mode filter are two 
main strategies to suppress common mode noise. The former 
employs compensation length to improve the symmetry of 
differential traces [3]. The compensation length depends on 
the level of the imbalance and only mitigates the local 
imbalance. That is, common mode noise resulting from other 
imbalances will not be eliminated by the compensation design. 
The latter is to use surface mounted device (SMD) or 
embedded structures to filter the common mode noise and still 
let differential signals propagate. It can reduce the common 
mode noise over all systems and is a good candidate to solve 
EMC problem.  
Common mode chokes and embedded DGS filters are 
presented in [4]-[8]. Because of the larger size and lower 
flexibility of defected-ground-structure (DGS) filter, common 
mode chokes are preferred to be applied in today's high speed 
digital system. Moreover, a LTCC common mode choke is 
superior to the chokes using ferrite materials due to it lower 
cost and higher operating frequencies[2], [8]. As a result, the 
design of a compact LTCC common mode choke with wider 
band rejection for common mode noise imposes a challenge in 
wireless and mobile communication systems. 
In this paper, a compact and wideband common mode filter 
is presented and fabricated on low temperature co-fired 
ceramic (LTCC) substrate. Different from the conventional 
common mode choke using the ferrite materials, it possesses 
the properties of high frequency operation, low mode 
conversion and low cost. Its good performance will be 
investigated on the application of the USB 3.0 cable. The 
differential mode insertion loss, common mode insertion loss  
and mode conversion loss will be seen both in the simulation 
and measurement. The capability of common-mode 
suppression will be demonstrated in the time domain 
measurement. In addition, the eye diagram to verify the signal 
integrity of this device and its test of common mode current 
suppression on USB 3.0 cable will be executed in this work.  
II. THEORY AND CONCEPT 
An equivalent circuit model is established to explain its 
filtering properties for the novel common-mode choke as 
shown in Fig. 1. The circuit model consists of two T-type 
circuit with a series inductor and two shunt capacitor and a 
parallel resonator. The T-type circuit with L1, C1, Lm, and Cm 
corresponds to the coupled line and the parallel resonator is 
formed by L2 and C2.

 The eye diagram to evaluate the differential signal quality 
is also measured in this work.  The input source is a pseudo 
random bit sequences (PRBSs) with the bit rate of the 5Gb/s, 
which is the nominal transmission bit rate of USB 3.0 cable. 
The sequence with 2048 - 1 bits is launched into the device 
through the USB 3.0 cable and the eye diagram is observed by 
the digital oscilloscope. Two sample devices are manufactured 
for comparison. One is the reference case and the other is the 
experimental case. The reference case is the test vehicle 
without a choke but allow the differential signal pass through. 
The experimental case is the test vehicle with the choke 
mounted on it.  Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) shows the measured 
results for the reference case and common mode choke, 
respectively. The corresponding eye width and the eye height 
are tabulated on Table I. The eye widths for two cases are 
almost the same, but the difference of eye height between the 
two cases is 6 mV. This is because the extra loss of the 
common mode choke. In practice, the eye diagram, including 
USB 3.0 cable and common mode choke, proves the proposed 
common mode choke still can support differential signal 
transmission up to 5 Gb/s. 
B. Common mode Suppression 
The capability of common-mode noise suppression is also 
investigated both in frequency domain and time domain.  The 
common mode suppression in frequency domain, in terms of 
the common mode insertion loss, is demonstrated in Fig. 4. 
Common mode noise is reduced over 10 dB from 1.4 to 3.7 
GHz. A stopband for common mode with FBW of 90 % is 
accomplished. 
  To demonstrate the suppression degree of the common 
mode choke in time domain. The differential lines with a short 
coupled line (reference board) and with the common mode 
choke (filter board) are both measured for comparison. To 
excite the common-mode noise, a signal skew is created by 
designing a delay line (8 mm) on one of the differential lines. 
Two 5 Gbps PRBSs with 1 V peak-to-peak voltage are 
differentially launched into port 1 and port 2 by the pattern 
generator (Anritsu MP1763C). The output waveforms are 
measured at port 3 and port 4 using digital oscilloscope. The 
common-mode noise (Vcommon) in terms of the half of the sum 
of the two output signals is observed in Fig. 6.  It shows that 
the peak-to-peak output common-mode voltage for the 
reference board is 460 mV, but it is reduced to 200 mV 
employing the proposed common mode choke. Over 57 % 
improvement is achieved. It proves that the proposed common

Abstract—A novel electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure 
is proposed to mitigate power noise in the power distribution 
network of RF SiP. In order to enhance the bandwidth of the 
suppression stopband, the proposed EBG structure is 
implemented by employing multi-layer printed circuit board and 
multiple power/ground via pairs with narrow pitch. The design 
concepts for the enhancement of the lower/upper bound cutoff 
frequency are investigated in this paper. Test boards are 
fabricated and measured to validate the accuracy of the design 
concepts. The measured results show good consistency with 
simulated ones. To demonstrate the influence of the power noise 
on RF SiP, a simulation environment including a 60 GHz power 
amplifier and power distribution network on the package level is 
established. Besides, the proposed EBG power/ground plane is 
employed to suppress the power noise and intermodulation 
distortion of the RF output spectrum. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the demand of highly integrated functions, there is a 
tendency of consumer electronics toward the mixed-signal 
circuits designing on system in a package (SiP). To maintain a 
stable systemic operation, power integrity design [1] is 
becoming a major challenge under the trend toward low 
supply voltage level and high speed operation. 
Simultaneous switching noise (SSN) is induced when the 
transient switching current of the digital circuits flows through 
the parasitics of the power distribution network (PDN) [2]. 
The SSN coupling throughout the shared PDN will degrade 
the output behavior of the analog/RF circuits. To guarantee 
the system performance, it is required to isolate sensitive 
analog/RF circuits from the SSN. 
The PDN is commonly designed as a planar structure, 
because not only additional capacitance between power and 
ground planes but also lower parasitic inductance for current 
return path can be reached simultaneously [3]. However, the 
resonance of the cavity formed by the planar PDN can be 
excited by SSN. When the SSN propagates in the resonance 
frequencies, there are several serious concerns for power 
integrity, signal integrity (SI) [4], and electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) issues [5]. 
Several solutions for maintaining the power integrity in the 
mixed-signal SiP have been overviewed in [1]. Arranging 
decoupling capacitors between power and ground planes is a 
typical way [6]. The decoupling capacitors provide the 
perturbing power noise an additional low impedance return 
path, thus the stable supply voltage level is maintained. 
However, the decoupling capacitors may behave inductively 
above the self resonance frequency due to the equivalent 
series inductance (ESL) formed by the capacitors themselves 
and the decoupling current loop. The self resonance frequency 
is usually up to hundreds megahertz only.  
To mitigate the power noise in high frequency range, three 
kinds of EBG prototypes have been investigated in the early 
literatures, such as photonic crystal power/ground layer 
(PCPL) [7]-[8], coplanar electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) 
structure [9]-[10] and mushroom-like EBG structure [11]-[12]. 
The unique property of the EBG power/ground planes, to 
provide a bandgap with omni-directional suppression ability 
for electromagnetic wave, is employed to improve the noise 
isolation within the desired stopband above gigahertz range. 
The concept of the PCPL is periodically embedding high 
permittivity material rods into the original substrate between 
the power and ground planes. Even though the performance of 
the PCPL has been improved and highlighted in [8], the 
demand of the high dielectric constant material rods is the 
main constraint on printed circuit board (PCB) or package 
fabrication. Without high fabrication costs, the coplanar EBG 
structure which is implemented by patterning the power plane 
only have been proposed in [7]-[8]. Although the coplanar 
EBG structure is a low cost design for noise suppression, the 
patterned power plane will limit the amount of the flowing 
current because of IR-drop. To avoid the IR-drop issue, the 
mushroom-like structure is embedded into the solid 
power/ground plane. It is implemented in a three-layer stack-
up and suitable for the popular multilayer PCB standard 
fabrication. However, the drawback is that the bandgap of the 
mushroom-like EBG structure presents a narrow bandwidth of 
stopband. In order to enhance the bandwidth of the 
mushroom-like EBG structure, a novel EBG design has been 
proposed [13]. However, only simulation results are presented 
in [13], both the mechanism of the bandgap and the 
measurement results are lack. 
In this paper, the mechanism analysis of the bandwidth-
enhanced EBG structure is proposed. Besides, the 
measurement results and a case study about power integrity 
issue in RF SiP are presented. This paper is organized as 
follows: In Section II, the geometry of the proposed structure 
is presented and compared with other work. In Section III, the 
design concepts of lower and upper bound cutoff frequencies 
of stopband are explained. In Section IV, the PCB fabrication 
process and the measured data are discussed. In Section V, the 
proposed EBG structure is used to protect the RF signal from 
978-1-4577-0811-4/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 715
bandwidth to the center frequency, of the proposed EBG 
structure and the GSPL are 82% and 57.1%, respectively. The 
extended stopband is achieved by the proposed EBG structure. 
The following section will explain the mechanism of the 
bandwidth and improve the bandwidth of the proposed EBG 
structure further. 
III. DESIGN CONCEPT 
In this section, the design concepts for the lower/upper 
bound cutoff frequencies (fL/fH) of the proposed EBG structure 
are discussed. 
A. Lower Bound Cutoff Frequency 
From Fig. 2(b), the lower bound cutoff frequencies of the 
proposed EBG structure and GSPL are 1.8 GHz and 3 GHz, 
respectively. It is obvious that the lower bound cutoff 
frequency is improved by the proposed EBG structure under 
the same dimension of the unit cell and embedded patch.  
The behaviour of the lower bound cutoff frequency can be 
described by using the simplified equivalent model proposed 
in [15]. The main mechanism leading to the lower fL of the 
proposed EBG structure than that of the GSPL is that the 
larger effective capacitance embedded between power and 
ground planes is reached by the proposed EBG structure. Fig. 
3 shows the effective capacitance of the proposed EBG 
structure and GSPL. The effective embedded capacitance of 
GSPL is formed by the capacitance between the power plane 
and the embedded ground patch only. However, there are two 
additional capacitance between power/ground plane in the 
proposed EBG structure. Through proper via connection 
design, the total effective embedded capacitance of the 
proposed EBG structure is three times larger than that of 
GSPL because of the parallel connection. This additional 
capacitance contributes to the lower fL. 
B. Upper Bound Cutoff Frequency 
The upper bound cutoff frequency is determined by the first 
resonance frequency of the unit cell. In the four-layer parallel-
plate structure shown in Fig. 1, the first resonance is depended 
on the power/ground via pitch. 
To illustrate the impact of power/ground via pitch on the 
upper bound cutoff frequency, a one-dimensional four-layer 
parallel-plate transmission line structure with only one 
power/ground via pair is considered as shown in Fig 4(a). The 
parameter v’ denotes via pitch of the power/ground via pair of 
the 1-D parallel-plate structure. 
According to the practical structure shown in Fig. 4(a), the 
corresponding one-dimensional transmission line equivalent 
circuit model is shown in Fig. 4(b). This equivalent model is 
divided into five parts. Part A and E represent a transmission 
line section formed by the power/ground parallel plate. Part B, 
C, and D are four layer stack-up structure. Each of them is 
modeled as the three transmission line sections formed by 
adjacent metal planes. Lv represents the parasitic inductance of 
the power and ground via.  
Fig. 5 shows the Z parameter calculated by two approaches. 
One is the practical structure and calculated by full wave 
simulator based on finite element method (FEM). The other is 
the transmission line circuit model and calculated by spice

Non-linearity of the power amplifier will result in the 
presence of the additional interference in the adjacent 
frequency bands. The out-of-band interference may degrade 
the signal-to-noise ratio of the wireless link operating in the 
continuous frequency channels. To guarantee the acceptable 
bit error rate, the output spectrum of the power amplifier must 
be below a specified transmit spectrum mask.  
Not only input signal but also power noise will induce the 
intermodulation distortion (IMD) due to the non-linearity of 
the power amplifier. The former is due to the third-order 
intermodulation (IM3) distortion caused by the input signal 
consisting of two closely spaced frequencies [16]. The latter is 
caused by the power noise with wideband spectrum coupling 
into the power amplifier [17]. The injected power noise acting 
as additional source can be upconverted to adjacent frequency 
bands by mixing with RF signal. Consequently, RF SiP 
without well-designed PDN may result in degradation of RF 
performance due to violations of spectral mask. 
Fig. 7(a) shows an example of the aforementioned power 
integrity issue in a RF SiP environment. There is a voltage 
variation caused by the transient current of the high speed 
digital circuits in the RF SiP. The supply voltage at the digital 
circuit VDD1 is assumed as 200 mV peak-to-peak and 3 GHz 
sinusoidal variation. The power noise propagates through the 
PDN of the RF SiP and couples to the power supply, VDD2, of 
the power amplifier operating in 60 GHz. Then the power 
noise will mix with the RF signal. As a result, although the 
frequency of the power noise is just 3 GHz far away from the 
RF frequency, two unwanted tones in 57 GHz and 63 GHz 
appear in the whole band between 57 GHz to 64 GHz and 
degrade the operation in the adjacent frequency channels.  
The simulated results of this scenario shown in Fig. 7(a) are 
plotted in Fig. 7(b). Red line describes the relation between 
input and output power of the power amplifier operating in 60 
GHz. Dot and dash blue lines show the power in dBm of on-
chip power noise, VDD2 shown in Fig. 7(a), and second 
intermodulation tone in 63 GHz, respectively. Because the 
level of the second intermodulation tone in 63 GHz is just 
similar to that in 57 GHz, Fig. 7(b) shows the former only. It 
is worth noting that the 100 pF SMT capacitor and 3 pF on-
chip capacitor are not enough to suppress the power noise 
coupling in 3 GHz. In order to improve the power supply 
rejection, the original bare PDN in the RF SiP is replaced by 
the proposed EBG PDN shown in Fig. 2(a). The dot and dash 
green lines show the results of the RF SiP with the proposed 
EBG PDN. It is clear that not only on-chip power noise but 
also second intermodulation distortion is dramatically 
eliminated.  
VI. CONCLUSION 
A bandwidth-enhanced EBG structure has been proposed. 
The stopband of the proposed EBG structure is from 1.8 GHz 
to 5.1 GHz. The design concepts of proposed EBG structure 
are based on embedded patches and via position arrangement. 
The lower and upper bound cutoff frequencies are improved 
by the alternately embedded patches and narrowed via pitch, 
recpectively. Besides, the interaction between power noise 
and non-linearity of power amplifier has been demonstrated. 
A 60 GHz RF SiP with the proposed EBG PDN is used to 
eliminate the power noise and the intermodulation distortion.
