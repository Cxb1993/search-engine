I. INTRODUCTION
Because of the large number of applications of the internet and other public communication networks,
information hiding has received rising interest, and has played an important role in multimedia technology.
The encoding process of data hiding codes, also known as watermarking codes, is to hide or embed a
watermark into another host signal, such as a photograph, music, video, or text. The two main requirements
of information hiding are fidelity and robustness [1]∼[3], that is, the watermark message must not
cause severe degradation on the host signal and must suffer from some common signal processing and
channel attacks. Other design criteria for digital watermarking are payload, security, and detectability.
Fundamental tradeoffs occur among payload, robustness, and complexity. This study developed practical
algorithms by analyzing these tradeoffs, robustness, fidelity and complexity. The applications of digital
watermarking include copyright protection [4], [5], fingerprinting tracing [6], [7] media forensics [8], [9],
and content authentication [10], [11] and signature verification [12], [13]. Referring to [14] and [15] for
a comprehensive survey of data hiding codes, the considered watermarking system had no knowledge
of the host signal in the receiver, that is, a watermarking system with a blind detector. To embed a
watermark in such a system, a host signal can be viewed purely as noise, called blind watermarking,
or exploited as side information, called informed watermarking. The corresponding system with blind
detector and informed watermarking can be modelled as communication with side information at the
transmitter [16], and allows more effective watermark embedding and detection methods. In general, the
encoding process of informed watermarking is divided into informed coding and informed embedding.
The purpose of informed coding is to choose a message codeword from a collection of possible candidates
to represent this watermark. This message codeword must have minimal perceptual distortion to the host
signal compared to other candidates. The informed coding is also known as dirty paper codes [17], [18] or
channel coding with side information [19], [20], [21], in which the binning scheme is used to achieve the
information-theoretic capacity [22], [23]. In informed embedding, the message codeword from informed
coding is subsequently modified according to the host signal, attempting to attain an optimal tradeoff
between fidelity and robustness in the watermarked image [24], [25], [26], [27]. This study focused on
the informed embedding method, in which the watermarked image is a function of the watermarked
message and the host signal to achieve near optimal robustness and maintain constant fidelity, or vice
versa. Miller et al. [26] proposed a suboptimal trellis-based embedding algorithm that starts with the
host signal and iteratively constructs an updated watermarked signal toward to the interior of the Voronoi
region of the message codeword.
In Miller’s work [26], an informed embedding algorithm used randomly generated reference vectors
as arc labels. A disadvantage is that the generated reference vectors can be selected randomly; therefor,
the trellis code is not an optimally structured code. In addition, modification of trellis structure modifies
such generated reference vectors. Thus, it is impractical to use generated reference vectors as arc labels.
Although this [26] trellis-based algorithm can achieve an excellent tradeoff between the fidelity and
robustness in watermarked images, this method is computationally intensive and difficult to implement.
Instead of using randomly generated reference vectors as arc labels in [26], this trellis structure was
modified by using the codewords of a linear block code to label the arcs in the trellis. The advantage
of using such linear codewords is that the codewords as arc labels can be easily produced by use of a

of size 8× 8; subsequently each block was converted into the frequency domain with the DCT transform.
The first 12 low-frequency AC coefficients in each block, shown in Fig. 2 of [26], where extracted and
concatenated to form the extracted vector v. Every n coefficients of v was subsequently used to embed
each bit of an L bits watermark, where L = 4096 · 12/n, and forms the watermarked image x. Finally,
we replaced the elements of x into their respective DCT coefficients, and converted all DCT blocks back
to the spatial domain, called Iw in Fig. 2. Because the extracted vector v was available at the transmitter,
the output of the informed embedding was denoted by x = f(w, v, α, β), where robust factor α and step
factor β are controllable parameters for message codeword w and extracted vector v, respectively. The
embedding goal aims to satisfy two conflicting criteria, that is, x must be perceptually indistinguishable
to v, and x must also be sufficiently close to w to enhance robustness.
III. THE PROPOSED INFORMED EMBEDDING ALGORITHM
For the proposed informed embedding scheme, this study used section-based embedding algorithm
instead of the informed embedding algorithm of [26]. The four inputs to the embedder were the extracted
vectors from the host sequence v = {v1, v2, · · · , vL}, the message codeword w = {w1, w2, · · · , wL}, and
the controllable factors α and β, where the vk and wk are vectors of length n with 1 ≤ k ≤ L. The

find xk to minimize the degradation of xk from vk, and simultaneously be closer to αwk, compared with
other candidates αc, c ∈ Γ, i.e.,
d(αwk, xk) ≤ d(αc, xk), c ∈ Γ and c 6= wk, (1)
where d(a, b) is the Euclidean distance between a and b. The detailed procedure of finding such xk is
illustrated as follows.
Let hk be the sign vector between vk and wk. That is for each component of vk and wk, we define
hk,i = sgn(vk,i · wk,i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, (2)
where sgn(a) = 1 if a ≥ 0 and sgn(a) = −1 if a < 0. Subsequently, we construct the ith component of
xk as follows: if hk,i = 1, then xk,i = vk,i, and if hk,i = −1, then
xk,i =
{
vk,i − β · d(αwk, vk), if vk,i ≥ 0
vk,i + β · d(αwk, vk), if vk,i < 0.
(3)
In other words, we move vk toward to wk by a distance βd(αwk, vk) for those positions in which vk and
wk are of opposite signs. If current xk satisfies (1), we then move on to the (k+1)-section, otherwise we
substitute vk by current xk and repeat the procedures in (2) and (3). The proposed informed embedding
causes perceptual degradation of the host signal for distinct α and β, and we can thus adjust the value of
α and β to achieve excellent tradeoff between the fidelity and robustness in watermarked images.
The proposed informed embedding algorithm is summarized as follows.
1) Let k = 1 and initialize xk = vk with a choice of a robust parameter α ≥ 1 and step parameter
β ∈ [0, 1].
2) If the current xk satisfies the criterion (1), move to Step 4, otherwise substitute vk by xk.
3) Update the kth watermarked image xk by (2) and (3), and move to Step 2.
4) If k = L then terminate, otherwise let k = k + 1 and xk = vk, and move to Step 2.
For example, an type-1 informed embedding is illustrated with a (7,3,4) simple code with α = 10 and
β = 0.1 in TABLE I and TABLE II.
M = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7} positions is the complement sign and thus, host vk where k ∈M must be modified.
First, the decoding region of the initial xk = vk falls into c4 and the type-1 algorithm achieves the object.

c8 26.962 29.539 28.349
Instead of using (1) as the criterion for the kth component of the current watermarked sequence in the
previous algorithm, we used the accumulation metric (4) as the criterion. That is, in the kth section,
we continued to update xk until the accumulation metric with respect to the message codeword wk was
smaller than the accumulation metric with respect to any other codeword in Γ, i.e.,
Jwk(sk−1, sk) < Jc(sk−1, sk), c ∈ Γ and c 6= wk. (5)
The watermarked image based on the criterion (5) may lie in the boundary of the decoding region of the
message codeword. We can enhance the robustness of the watermarked image by
Rk = min
c∈Γ,c 6=wk
{Jc(sk−1, sk)} − Jwk(sk−1, sk). (6)
Several methods are used to choose Rk. We first choose a constant threshold R, and subsequently let
Rk = k
R
L
. We used the same procedure as in III-A; in particular, equations (2) and (3) were used to
update the current xk until xk satisfied the criteria (5) or (6). Moreover, after the final xk for the kth
section was found, we then updated each kth state metric in the k-section by
αk(sk) = min
sk−1
{αk−1(sk−1) + d(αc(sk−1, sk), xk)}, (7)
where the minimum is taken over those sk−1 connected to sk. This informed embedding algorithm with
distortion accumulation is summarized as follows:
1) Let k = 1 and initialize xk = vk with a choice of a robust parameter α ≥ 1, and step parameter
β ∈ [0, 1].
2) If the current xk satisfies the criterion (5), (6) respectively, move to step 4, otherwise substitute vk
by xk.
3) Update the kth watermarked image xk by (2) and (3), and move to Step 2.
4) If k = L, terminate; otherwise let k = k + 1 and xk = vk, update the state metric αk(sk) by (7),
and move to Step 2.
TBALE III reports the robustness results of informed embedding for various algorithms over addition
of Gaussian noise. For a fixed image quality, Watson distance is equal to 135, the error rate of the
type-1 algorithm is close to Miller’s for robustness measure. Although the error rate of type-2 informed
embedding algorithm is poor than type-1’s and Miller’s, the complexity of type-2 algorithm is much lower
than that of others.
can be found using the Viterbi algorithm to decode at the receiver. The received vector y is used for hard
decision, followed by Viterbi decoding. Although the decoding performance with a hard Viterbi algorithm
cannot parallel that by a soft type, the embedding coding with decoding performance can be improved at
the same level of distortion based on the structure referred to in Section III-A.
The idea is illustrated as follows: assuming the seven extracted vectors
vk = (7.9,−5.0, 2.2, 7.7,−0.7,−0.2, 1.1),
the codeword of the (7,3,4) simplex code is chosen as the label of the trellis structure. With the minimal
distance of simplex code as 4, the number of correctable bits is t = b(4 − 1)/2c = 1. Setting R to 0.1
and assuming the message codeword wk = (1,−1,−1, 1,−1, 1, 1) in the section k, the modification of
vk,i into xk,i is tabulated as follows: when hk,i = 1 and xk,i = vk,i, that is, vk,i and wk,i are of the same
sign, vk,i remains unchanged. The rest of vk,i of opposite signs are arranged in order as
Λ = {v˜k,6, v˜k,3} = {−0.2, 2.2}
v˜k,3 remains unchanged for the maximal t = 1 components, that is, xk,3 = v˜k,3. The remainder of v˜k,6 are
defined as
xk,6 =
{
−0.1, if v˜k,6 > 0
0.1, if v˜k,6 ≤ 0
From this equation, xk,6 = 0.1. Finally, xk is presented in TABLE IV.

xk,i 7.9 -5.0 2.2 4.7 -0.7 0.1 1.1
The algorithm proposed in this section uses preceding procedure to embed information. A low level of
distortion is acquired by use of the hard decoding at the receiver. The reasons that such algorithm requires
less embedding complexity than those referred to in the previous section are stated as follows:
1) It is not essential to accumulate metric as compared to Viterbi algorithm when performing trellis
operation in each section.
2) Iteration is not required when performing trellis operation in each section. It requires only one time
of sign reverse.
3) Viterbi decoding with hamming metric is used at the decoder.
Consequently, the execution complexity is reduce substantially.
D. informed coding with parallel branch structure
The basic idea about watermarking is to hide the information into the host signal such that the perceptual
fidelity of the host signal is minimal. The perceptual fidelity efficiency can be gained by informed coding
except informed embedding. An informed coding is a structure design of the trellis. We divide the informed
coding technique into parallel and scatter structure for a trellis structure. The parallel structure use parallel
configuration, which a current state connects to next same state by more one arcs, to generate multi-
selection codeword. However, the scatter structure is a design that current state connected to next other
state but the arcs without parallel configuration. The informed coding with scatter structure needs using
Viterbi algorithm to embed message. For informed coding with parallel structure, the message is embedded
without performing Viterbi algorithm instead of finding the close codeword in parallel arcs. Thus, the

Fig. 8. Modified informed coding : four states, sixteen arcs trellis
trellis as blind coding, but we have the double arcs of blind coding for this trellis. For encoding procedure,
the informed coding with parallel structure chooses the candidate arcs, which is close to the host signal,
according to the encoded message mk without performing Viterbi algorithm. Thus, the computational
complexity of parallel structure is lower than scatter structure’s. At the receiver, the detector employ
Viterbi algorithm. Finally,we find the hided message corresponding to each arcs for this path.
For robustness concerns over addition of Gaussian noise, we discusses the MER efficiency for various
structures such as blind embedding structure, parallel structure and scatter structure as TABLE V. TA-
BLE V reports that the informed coding using codeword of linear block codes as arc label is of superior
error rate than random codes as arc label of Miller’s.

E. Combine informed embedding with informed coding
For robustness concerns, the proposed informed watermarking system mainly contribute by the proposed
informed embedding. The type-1 informed embedding use a section-based and memoryless method
to enhance the robustness. The watermarked signal may as close to message codeword as possible
according to acceptable fidelity so that the informed embedding obtain high robustness. In fact, the optimal
sequence. If the S is equally distributed, it is known that the Viterbi algorithm is optimal with respect to
the MAP sequence criterion. By generalizing the Viterbi algorithm, we obtain

where P (y) denotes a constant with respect to the MAP sequence of states such that

The Viterbi algorithm [28] is the most efficient method to find an optimal state sequence S∗, or an

3) Low pass filter
Low pass filter, such as run average filters or Gaussian filters, are often applied in image processing.
We chose the Gaussian filter for our simulation. As shown in Fig. 13, the bit error rate performance
of these four algorithms can be optimized under the low pass filter attack when setting t = 3 and
7 in type-3. The [26] algorithm provides superior bit error rate performance; however, it requires a
higher complexity than type-1 and type-2. The algorithm of type-3 requires the lowest complexity
and provides superior performance to [26]. Fig. 14 shows the watermarked image through the

In addition, the survive path is up to Add-Compare-Select (ACS) operations in each section, and
it is for sure that different informed embedding algorithm brings about different number of ACS
operations. Consequently, for the same length of watermarked image, the computational complexity
is directly related to the average number of ACS operations in each section. In simple terms, a
larger number of ACS operations gives rise to a higher complexity and a longer period of time to
get the operations done. Taking a trellis with 32 states, each with 2 arcs, as an instance, it is known
that the metric accumulated in the previous section pertains to the trellis states and the number of
arcs. Since each current state is connected to two arcs, thus two adders are required to perform
additions, that is, it necessitates Ca number of adders in each section. Inasmuch as there are two
arcs connected to each next state, a comparer is thus required for comparison. In brief, there are
32 next states and 64 arcs in each section, that is, 32 comparers and 64 adders. Hence, the ACS
complexity Cs for each section is given as
Cs = Ca × Ce + Ca × adders+ (Ca/2)× comparers
As presented in Subsection III-A, the type-1 algorithm is a section-based informed embedding
algorithm, i.e. a memoryless informed embedding approach performed independently in each section.
In other words, it does not require any adder or comparer to perform any accumulation operations.
Yet, there are Ca number of comparers required in search for an object message codeword out of
all the arcs. The complexity required is expressed as
Ca × Ce + Ca × comparers
As for the type-2 algorithm, as presented in Subsection III-B, there exists a trade off between
the fidelity and the robustness specified a robust parameter R. Just as regular Viterbi algorithms,
it requires an accumulated metric, except that it is performed in an iterative manner until the
target value Rt of the robustness is reached with a specified complexity Cs. Due to iterations,
the total operation load varies across sections. Accordingly, the average value of Cs is adopted as
the complexity for each section. With Cavg representing the average number of operations in each

 (4) Audio and Acoustics Signal Processing: the Quest for High Fidelity continues  
 
每天的 Plenary Session後，就根據自己的專長及興趣，到各個不同的場次聽論文發
表，或與相識的國內外教授學者相互交談、交換意見。本人 poster presentation 安
排在３月２７日下午發表，論文題目為：A Suboptimal Embedding Algorithm for Binary 
Matrix Embedding。對於此篇海報論文，在場數位先進給於熱烈的討論及意見，令本人
獲益良多。3月 30日下午結束所有議程，本人於 3月 30日晚間返抵台中。 
 
二、與會心得 
本次 ICASSP2012 所發表的論文所有訊號處理與其相關技術領域各層面，參加人
數非常之多，是個可以提供與其他與會學者討論研究方向的國際會議。本人的專長主
要為錯誤更正碼，浮水印技術與資料隱藏技術，本次發表之論文為如何利用錯誤更正
碼應用於資料隱藏技術，參加本次會議最大的受益是了解如何將相關的技術應用於實
際的系統中。本人深感興趣之研究主要為 watermarking and data hiding之相關演講
與其應用。相關論文在本次會議中共超過 6個 sections，其中很多的論文均與本人的
研究有密切的相關性。其他數篇有關 communication systems 與 sensor network 的論文
也特別引起本人的興趣。這些觀念對我們的研究可提供一些不同的思考方向，的確令
人受益菲淺。訊號處理與其相關技術領域在工業或學術研究上都是一個非常重要的領
域，全世界均有許多學者投入這個領域的研究。本人由於會議的參與，認識不少國內
外學者，並使本人之論文得以與他人充分溝通及交換意見，收穫自然不少，提高國內
學術研究的風氣。
