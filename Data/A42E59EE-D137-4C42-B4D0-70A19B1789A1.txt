Abstract 
Microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A2+ = Zn, Co and x 
= 0.02–0.08) ceramics were investigated in this article. The forming of solid solutions was 
confirmed by the X-ray diffraction analysis, the EDX analysis, and the measured lattice parameters. 
A small amount of Zn- or Co- substitution for Mg has a significant effect on the Qf of the ceramics 
and indicates an up to 260% increase in its value compared to that of the pure Li2MgTi3O8. The 
relationships between ionic polarizability, packing fraction, and microwave dielectric properties in 
Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 ceramics were also discussed. Specimen using Li2(Mg0.96Zn0.04)Ti3O8 possesses 
a moderate dielectric constant of 28.7, a very small τf of –3.18 ppm/°C, and in particularly an 
extremely high Qf of 151,200 GHz, demonstrating an unique potential for low-loss microwave 
applications.

to improve the mentioned problem. The sintering temperatures of the compounds could be lowered 
by adding proper sintering aids[10], and substitutions were also employed to improve the 
performance of the dielectrics[11,12]. George et al. had reported the microwave dielectric 
properties of Li2Mg1−xZnxTi3O8 with an increment of 0.1 for x and shown the best dielectric 
properties with r  = 27, Q×f = 62,000 GHz, and f = 1.1 ppm/°C for x = 0.1.[11] Small 
substitution (< 10 mole%) has a significant effect on the Q×f improvement and have been shown for 
many ceramics. In fact, a small amount of Mg or Co substitution for Zn with an increment of 0.01 
in the Li2(Zn1−xAx)Ti3O8 (A = Mg, Co) system was investigated and produced a large increase in 
Qf for A = Mg at x = 0.06 ( r  = 26.1, Q×f = 150,000 GHz, and f  = –13.9 ppm/°C) and A = Co 
at x = 0.08 ( r  = 24.7, Q×f = 140,000 GHz, and f  = –13.4 ppm/°C).[12] Interestingly, it comes 
to a question asking if it is still valid the other way around, a small amount of Zn or Co substitution 
for Mg with an increment of 0.01 in the Li2(Mg1−xAx)Ti3O8 (A = Zn, Co) system. Also, the f  of 
Li2(Zn1−xAx)Ti3O8 (A = Mg, Co) system is still not small enough for practical applications. 
In this study, Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A2+ = Zn, Co and x = 0.02–0.08) solid solutions were 
synthesized to investigate the effect of a small amount of Zn and Co substitutions for Mg on the 
microwave dielectric properties of the ceramics. The resultant microwave dielectric properties were 
analyzed based on the densification, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, microstructures, ionic 
polarizabilities, and packing fraction of the ceramics. , In particularly, the correlation between the 
Qf and the microstructure, the densification, and the packing fraction were investigated.

3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 illustrates the XRD patterns recorded from the Li2(Mg1–xZnx)Ti3O8 and 
Li2(Mg1–xCox)Ti3O8 ceramics sintered at 1200°C and 1170°C, respectively. Strong XRD peaks of a 
cubic-structured phase of Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 type (indexed as Li2MgTi3O8, 
ICDD-PDF#00-048-0263, the space group P4332 (212)) was classified as the single phase and its 
position slightly shifted toward the lower angle with increasing Zn and Co contents due to the 
incorporation of larger Co2+ (0.745 Å, CN=6) and Zn2+ (0.74 Å, CN=6) in place of Mg2+ (0.72 Å, 
CN=6), which implied the compounds tend to form a continuous solid solution. The variation of 
lattice parameter, cell volume, and theoretical density as a function of x is shown in Table 1. All 
these three parameters also indicate a linear increase with increasing x. 
Table 2 illustrates the microwave dielectric properties of the Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A = Zn, Co 
and x = 0.02–0.08) ceramic system. The relative density and microwave dielectric properties of the 
system strongly depend on the compositions. The theoretical density is calculated from XRD results 
and illustrated in Table 1. The relative density of over 95% theoretical density (TD) is reached for 
all compositions under test with A = Zn, whereas there are only x = 0.05 and 0.06 for A = Co that an 
over 95% TD is reached. With the increase of x in the compound, the relative density increased to a 
where  is the linear thermal expansion coefficient of the dielectric ( is typically in the range of 
3–15 ppm/oC for most of dielectric ceramics). It is generally known that   is proportional to the 
relative magnitude of unit cell volume. However, the f  remains almost unchanged with different 
unit cell volumes. This is because the variation of unit cell volume is relatively small (Table 1) and 
the change of   can therefore be neglected. In addition to the relative density, the ionic 
polarizability is also a main factor that affects the dielectric constant of the ceramics and the 
relationship between dielectric constant and polarizability can be expressed through the 
Clausius-Mossotti equation. With increasing x value, the ionic polarizability ( D ) of the samples 
slightly increases to a maximum and decreases thereafter as shown in Fig. 3. Although the 
molecular volume linearly increases with increasing x, the variation of ionic polarizability is 
consistant with that of dielectric constant which suggests that in addition to the relative density, the 
variance in the dielectric constant can be attributed to the change in ionic polarizability. 
 The SEM images of the thermal-etched surfaces of Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A2+ = Zn, Co) 
ceramics are shown in Fig. 4. The Li2(Mg0.95Co0.05)Ti3O8 sample sintered at 1110°C shows a 
distribution of comparably small grain sizes and a noticeable amount of intergranular porosity, 
whereas grain growth is observed for Li2(Mg0.96Zn0.04)Ti3O8 sintered at the same temperature. The 
grain size increases with the increase of sintering temperature and the grains are closely packed and 
only a small amount of porosity can be observed at 1170°C for both compositions. The typical EDS 
data of the thermally etched surfaces of Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A2+ = Zn, Co) ceramics are presented in 
Table 2 and it indicates the Li+ atoms can not be detected by EDS. Accordingly, the element content 
 4. Conclusion 
Ceramics with the formula Li2(Mg1–xAx)Ti3O8 (A2+ = Zn, Co and x = 0.02–0.08) were prepared 
to study their microwave dielectric properties. XRD patterns can be indexed as a single cubic 
phase (P4332), confirming the formation of solid solution. The variation trend of dielectric 
constant is in accordance with that of the relative density and ionic polarizability. Both relative 
density and packing fraction have effects on Q×f for specimens with small substitutions. However, 
the compositional factor becomes dominant when x < 0.04 for A= Zn and x < 0.05 for A= Co. 
Although the cell volume linearly increases with the increase of x, the f  remains virtually 
unchanged in the entire compositional range since the variation of unit cell volume is small.
