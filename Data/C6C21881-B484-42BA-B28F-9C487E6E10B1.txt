resistance due to its chemical inertness (∆H298 = -365.2 kJ/mol) and the formation of an oxidation 
layer (ZrO2) [13], where nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms on the film surface.  
Since ZrO2 has very high corrosion resistance against chloride, ZrN film displays a better corrosion 
resistance than TiN film which has passivated surface to interact with the environment [10].  These 
superior properties of ZrN film attract interests of tool, microelectronic and decorative industries. 
For the industrial application, physical vapor deposition (PVD) is an environmental-friendly 
and productive method.  However, since Zr has a higher melting point, a lower vapor pressure, and 
higher susceptibility of the contamination by oxygen and carbon than those of Ti and Cr, it is more 
difficult to deposit ZrN films than TiN or CrN films by evaporation-related PVD methods.  As a 
result, fewer studies have been performed on ZrN than other popular transition metal nitride films. 
To meet the requirement of nanotechnology, the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance 
of the coatings can no longer rely on increasing the coating thickness.  Therefore, without 
increasing the cost on source materials, adding an interlayer may effectively enhance the adhesion 
of the coatings [14-16] and relieve the residual stress[17], and thereby improving the performance 
of the coatings.  Recently, many studies on the multilayer coatings indicated that the interlayer 
may result in higher thermal stability and hardness [18].  The processing of a film with interlayer 
can be controlled such that the structure is effectively adjusted for the dislocation and defection, 
which leads to high hardness and Young’s modulus [19,20]. Some researches indicated that the 
multilayer structure of films can improve the corrosion resistance of films by decreasing the pinhole 
density with respect to a single-layer film [21,22]. 
Many interlayer materials, such as Ti [4], Cr [23], Ni [24], have been used in industry, and the 
performance of the coatings has also been verified in commercial products.  However, relatively 
fewer studies have been carried out in Zr used as an interlayer material.  In this study, silicon wafer 
with pre-coated Zr interlayer is used as substrate material.  The purpose of this research is to 
investigate the effect of interlayer thickness on the structure and properties of ZrN coatings. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
The P-type Si (100) wafers were used in this study as the substrate materials. The dimensions 
of Si substrate were one-quarter of a four-inch silicon wafer with thickness of 0.52 mm.  Before 
the coating process, all specimens were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol, progressively, 
each for 5 minutes, and then dried by purging with nitrogen gas for a few minutes. 
The deposition of zirconium interlayer was carried out in an unbalanced magnetron sputtering 
(UBMS) system.  The coating chamber was continuously evacuated to a base vacuum of 8 × 10-4 
Pa (6 ×  10-6 torr).  Before deposition, the substrate was pre-sputtered at 350  by argon ℃
(99.9995% in purity) discharge at a bias of -1000V for 10 minutes to remove the surface oxide layer.  
A rectangular zirconium target (99.95% in purity) with dimensions of 248 × 130 × 10 mm3 was 
used for sputtering.  The target power supply was operated at 0.9 A using a constant-current mode.  
The flow rate of argon gas (99.9995% in purity) was fixed at 50 sccm with a partial pressure of 0.26 
Pa (2.0 mtorr).  The working pressure was maintained at 0.26 Pa during deposition.  The 
temperature of specimen was maintained at 350°C, which was monitored by attaching a thermal 
couple directly behind the substrate insulated by a mica sheet. 
The deposition of ZrN film was performed in a hollow cathode discharge ion-plating (HCD-IP) 
system.  Before deposition, the specimens were gradually heated to a temperature of 390°C.  The 
specimen temperature was monitored by attaching a thermal couple directly behind the substrate 
insulated by a mica sheet.  Meanwhile, the coating chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 
8×10-4 Pa (6×10-6 torr) to avoid the contamination during deposition. 
Prior to deposition, the specimen surface was bombarded by Ar ions for 10 minutes at a 
pressure of 14.63 Pa (0.11 torr) and a negative substrate bias of 250V.  The Zr source, with a purity 
of 99.95%, was evaporated by the electron beam from the hollow cathode tube, which was initiated 
by introducing 133.3 to 266.6 Pa (1 to 2 torr) of Ar gas (99.99995% in purity) and keeping the gun 
current at 200 A.  A negative bias voltage of 60 V was applied onto the substrate. During coating 
process, the working gas was consisted of 10.4 sccm (0.16 Pa) of Ar and 17.5 sccm (3.32 × 10-2 Pa) 
 4
4-circle diffractometer with psi goniometer geometry.  The operation power were 45 kV × 40 mA.  
The beam-defining collimating slit was 2 mm × 2 mm in this study.  The specimens were 
mounted on the goniometer, and nine tilted angles, ψ, ranging from -50° to +50°, were chosen.  
The grazing incidence angle θ was set at 2°.  The 2θ angle of the X-ray detector was ranged from 
54° to 60° to obtain the ZrN(220) peak (2θ=56.833° for ZrN(220) from JCPDS#35-0753).  The 
residual stress of ZrN can be obtained from the linear fitting of the following equation [30]:

αψ −  is the strain at the tilting angle ψ, E is the Young’s modulus, the value of α is 
the 2θ angle minus the grazing incidence angle 2°, ν is the Poisson’s ratio, and σ is the stress of 
the thin film.  
Young’s modulus can be obtained from nanoindentation using the following equation:

Whereνandνi (0.07) [31] are the Poisson’s ratios of the thin film and indenter tip material, 
respectively, and the Ei (1141 GPa) and Er are the Young’s moduli of the indenter tip material and 
the reduced modulus from the result of nanoindenter, respectively.  
 
3. Results And Discussion 
In the beginning of the experiment, the Zr interlayer was prepared using the HCD-IP system.  
Although two-layer structure was observed in the SEM photograph after the deposition of the top 
ZrN layer, as shown in Fig. 1, the AES depth profiles (Fig. 2) does not reveal the expected decrease 
of N in the interlayer where the composition is supposed to be pure Zr. 
A few approaches have been taken for solving this problem.  Highly purified Ar gas 
(99.99995% in purity) was used for the coating process, and minor leakages in the vacuum system 
were sealed to reduce the residual nitrogen gas content, and nitrogen gas was disconnected from the 
HCD-IP system.  Unfortunately, a pure Zr single layer still could not be obtained.  It was found 
that the surface color of the Zr single layer was always light gold, which is not the color of pure 
zirconium film.  XRD patterns, as shown in Fig. 3, also indicate that the deposited layer containing 
large amount of ZrN mingling with Zr. 
It is speculated that the highly ionized Zr ions by the large e-beam in HCD-IP system may 
drastically enhance the reactivity of Zr and residual nitrogen gas during deposition.  As a result, it 
is extremely difficult to deposit a pure Zr film without the contamination of N using the HCD-IP 
system. 
To solve this problem, the deposition of Zr interlayer was carried out in an UBMS system, and 
then ZrN was deposited on the Zr-coated Si substrate using the HCD-IP system.  A typical XRD 
pattern of the substrate which was coated a Zr layer by UBMS was shown in Fig. 4.  It can be seen 
that the Zr layer has a highly (0002) fiber texture (2θ = 34.834 °  for Zr(0002) from 
JCPDS#89-4902).  In addition, the surface color of the Zr layer was silver, which should be the 
color of pure Zr. 
Although a normal ZrN/Zr two layer specimen is expected when preparing the specimen using 
HCD-IP, the results are somewhat surprising and interesting.  The most intriguing result is the 
appearance of ZrO2 in the Zr interlayer.  The XRD and AES results of the four two-layer 
specimens will be presented and the oxide formation mechanism will be qualitatively discussed. 
Fig. 5(a) shows the AES depth profiles of the specimen S11. The sputtering yield of the two 
layers in AES spectra was calibrated using the thickness measured from SEM image of the same 
specimen.  A schematic layer diagram illustrated the layer structure with marked film thickness is 
depicted in Fig. 5(b).  From the AES results, it clearly indicates that the pre-coated Zr interlayer 
has been completely oxidized during the process of the deposition of ZrN.  The XRD pattern of the

Since the vacuum conditions of the system have been fully inspected and the base 
vacuum was 8 × 10-4 Pa, the oxygen in the Zr layer may come from the dissolving oxygen 
during deposition in UBMS system or the residual oxygen content during evacuation in the 
HCD-IP system before the deposition of ZrN.  It is known that Zr is a very good oxygen 
getter and oxygen can be dissolved in Zr to a very high concentration up to 20 at%, which is 
clearly demonstrated in the AES results of the specimen S21 (Fig.6(a)).  As mentioned, 
oxygen can be uptaken by the Zr layer during deposition of Zr in UBMS system or chamber 
evacuation before the deposition of ZrN, where the specimen was heated to 350°C for 3 
hours.  However, why does the oxidation occur in HCD-IP process but not in UBMS 
process? 
In the case of depositing Zr interlayer by UBMS system, since the ionization rate is 
much lower than that in the HCD-IP system, the corresponding energy input during 
deposition by ion impingement is also lower.  In addition, the Ar ion impingement during 
deposition will reduce oxygen adsorption on the surface.  This suggests that the oxygen 
uptake is low and the oxidation reaction is not easy to occur due to low input energy for 
overcoming the activation barrier, even the temperature during deposition is up to 350°C. On 
the other hand, in the HCD-IP chamber before depositing ZrN, there is no Ar ion 
bombardment and the Zr-coated specimen stays at 350°C for 3 hours.  It is reasonable that 
the oxygen occlusion in the HCD-IP system will be much higher than that in UBMS system.  
To understand the uptake of oxygen during the 3-hour heating period, a Zr-coated specimen 
was heat treated and the AES depth profile of the specimen is shown in Fig. 9.  It can be 
seen that the oxygen content is about 10-12 at%.  Obviously, more oxygen should be 
uptaken during the deposition of ZrN for the supply of oxygen to react with the Zr underlayer 
and form ZrO2.   Moreover, since HCD-IP has a much higher ionization rate, there will be 
higher ion impingement on the substrate surface and thereby delivering much higher energy 
into the substrate material during the deposition of ZrN.  This input energy may facilitate the 
overcome of activation barrier of the oxidation occurring in the Zr interlayer. 
In the case of S11, during the time duration of 420 seconds in depositing ZrN, the 
oxidation takes place through the whole Zr interlayer, which is evidenced by the 
disappearance of the Zr (0002) peak in XRD pattern and the appearance of ZrO2 in both XRD 
and AES results.  This suggests that in 420 seconds the dissolved oxygen and the oxygen 
uptaken in this duration can completely react with the Zr interlayer and convert the Zr 
interlayer to ZrO2.  Compared with specimen S11, S21 possesses a two times thicker Zr 
interlayer and the thickness of the ZrO2 layer is also larger than that of specimen S11.  Since 
the evacuation and heating duration before depositing ZrN was 3 hours for all four specimens, 
the dissolved oxygen content should be about the same for all samples.  In addition, both 
S11 and S21 have the same deposition time of ZrN.  From Fig. 6(a), the oxygen content in 
the Zr interlayer that is not oxidize is about 20 at%, which is presumable to be the oxygen 
solubility in the Zr interlayer before oxidation.  The AES depth profiles also indicate that the 
oxidation depth in 420 seconds is 158 nm, which is larger than the oxide layer in the 
specimen S11.  This suggests that the reaction depth of ZrO2 in 420 seconds is 158 nm.  On 
the other hand, oxygen can diffuse through the whole thickness of the 200 nm Zr interlayer, 
which can be evidenced by comparing the oxygen contents of the specimen before ZrN 
deposition (Fig. 9) with that after deposition (Fig.6(a)).   
The AES depth profiles (Fig. 7(a)) of the specimen S12 show a very interesting 
oxidation behavior.  The Zr, N, and O depth profiles in the original Zr interlayer indicate 
that the Zr interlayer has been completely oxidized and then the abundant Zr in the ZrO2 is 
squeezed out and precipitates in the Si substrate.  This can be explained from the 
stoichiometry of ZrO2.  For the stoichiometric ZrO2, the ratio of O to Zr should be 2:1.  To 
form ZrO2 compound, more oxygen should be absorbed in the interlayer and/or the abundant

RBS analysis was use to obtain the packing factors and N/Zr ratios of the thin films.  
The N/Zr ratio of single layer ZrN specimen, S01, S02 and S03, were calculated from the 
simulation results of the RBS analyses.  The N/Zr ratios of ZrN films with interlayers, i.e. 
S11 to S22, were obtained from the AES results, which were corrected by the simulation 
results of RBS.  All N/Zr ratios of the top layer of these specimens were 0.9±0.1. 
The electrical resistivity of the ZrN films was measured using a four-point probe.  The 
results of electrical resistivity of films are listed in Table 2.  It can be seen that the electrical 
resistivity of single layer ZrN films is ranged from 53.31 to 84.08 µΩ-cm, roughly in the 
same order of magnitude.  S01 has a little higher value than that of S02 and S03 due to its 
lower packing factor.  The electrical resistivity of multilayer specimens was varied from 
71.6 to 278.2 µΩ-cm.  It can be seen that the resistivity decreased with increasing thickness 
of ZrN layer of the film. 
The hardness of the ZrN films was measured by nanoindentation (NIP). Each reported 
hardness value was the average of ten indentations.  All hardness data are listed in Table 2.  
The hardness values of the ZrN films range from 14.2 to 22.6 GPa.  It appears that the 
hardness of deposited films is increased with increasing ZrN film thickness.  However the

奧地利與葡萄牙，美國仍為參加人數最多的國家約佔百分之三十。在
亞洲國家方面除了日本與台灣之外，韓國亦為參加人數較多的國家。
中國大陸方面今年有人由大陸直接來美與會，不過人數仍然很少。今
年內容一如以往具有學術與應用兩個面向，尤其是大會演講與各議程
中之邀請演講均有非常高的水準，因此參與此會收獲相當豐碩，在此
謹將心得報告如下。 
每年會議中最有分量也最精采的演講為開議日之 Plenary 
Session，今年為 G.B. Olson教授發表之”Systems Design of Materials”。 
Olson 教授為美國西北大學材料系教授，他是世界知名的冶金學家，
尤其在金屬材料相變化的研究為美國中生代之佼佼者。他的演講內容
非常具有前瞻性，主要提出一個未來材料發展的方向。自六十年代以
來，過去四十年中材料尤其是新材料的發展，大部分是由大學或工業
界實驗室中，經由嘗試錯誤的方法，再利用冶金或材料之熱力學與動
力學之原理作為導則，由實驗室小量製作再轉移到工業界量產。在此
模式中，經驗扮演極為重要的角色，而理論與計算僅居於陪襯的地
位。然而九十年代之後，由於電腦運算能力呈指數上升，而且材料分
析技術日新月異，尤其是電子顯微鏡與同步輻射 X 光，使得材料結
構之鑑定進入原子層次，因此固態物理與量子化學理論與計算日益扮
演重要角色。 
Olson 教授最近十五年來，主持一個非常大的計畫，耗資一億美
元，結合美國國內二十多個產學研的研究團隊，進行材料設計
(Material by design)之研究。他們的方法是，先設定所需材料之性質，
然後經由多尺度(multiscale)計算模擬，由最基本的量子物理計算，再
到分子動力學模擬材料為結構之變化，再往上到傳統的材料相變化與
固化理論之計算，得到可能的材料成分組合；然後再進行實際的材料
 4
沒有實際的計算結果證實此假說。但今年有多位與會學者提出第一原
理理論計算結果，雖然結果仍未能一致，但初步顯示節點分解可能發
生而且有實驗證據支持。此外加州理工學院 Goodard教授關於薄膜材
料結構與性質之第一原理計算預測的論文亦令人矚目。他的團隊主要
是由理論物理入手進行材料性質與結構之計算，並成功的預測一些高
分子薄膜之性質。由此可見材料計算科學在先進的研究團隊中，正方
興未艾，國內必須要開始籌組相似的團隊，以免落後。 
在濺鍍製程研究方面，與去年比較與會者多已能將理論的電漿計
算與電漿實驗量測搭配，對於將來近一步自動化製程奠定一個有利的
基礎，相信未來數年內電漿理論計算可能融入濺鍍製程設計之中。然
而據本人所知，國內在電漿領域的研究工作者，沒有從事此方面的研
究，而國內濺鍍機台製作廠商之水準，仍停留與仿製國外設計，由於
高科技業界使用濺鍍製程很多，我們應該有很大的提升空間。 
在薄膜機械性質方面，奈米壓痕法與奈米硬度機的相關研究仍是
各國發展的主力。除了新的計算方法與解釋之外，今年較特別臨場實
驗(in-situ)。其中美國普渡大學 Stach教授的報告最引人注目。他的研
究團隊結合奈米硬度機廠商 Hysitron Inc.發展在穿透式電子顯微鏡
中，裝設奈米硬度機，同時觀察薄膜在受到奈米硬度壓痕頭壓入後，
材料內部差排結構之變化。在報告中 Stach教授直接播放實驗中錄製
之影片，清楚的顯示差排與晶界受力後之連續的變化，澄清了許多過
去無法明確解釋之現象，同時亦發現在奈米晶薄膜中，因為受到應力
而引發的晶粒粗化現象。不過由於錄影的時間解析度過低，奈米晶的
塑性變形機制，如晶界滑動與晶粒轉動的現象仍未證實。 
在超硬膜的研究方面，今年論文數量仍有增加。鑽石膜、類鑽膜
與奈米碳管的論文仍然有一個議程。在多層與複合膜製作方面在本次
 6
我國而言，此市場應是傳統機械材料升級的最佳方向，我們應積極
投入以獲取最大之效益。 
 
在建議方面，有以下幾點： 
(1) 近數年來台灣參與本會議之人數平均有六十人以上，可見國內從
事鍍膜的產學研界人力相當多，參與的研究生亦相當多，此方面
的人力整合工作主要由台灣鍍膜科技協會負責。過去兩年除了舉
辦固定的年會外，台灣鍍膜科技協會亦曾在台北舉辦國際會議。
希望國科會能繼續支持協會之產學相關活動，以提昇國內鍍膜科
技水準。 
(2) 目前薄膜科技主要有兩大方向，超硬膜與電子元件薄膜此外生醫
薄膜亦開始受到重視。從與會各國的經費支持單位來看，在歐美
先進國家，除了業界投入研發經費外，國家的支持更是主力。國
科會在支持微電子元件鍍膜研究方面，已有顯著成效，但在硬質
鍍膜方面，尤其是 PVD方面，則經費相較之下，實有不足。建議
國科會能多加支持，以使國內之硬質鍍膜研究能與先進國家同步。 
(3) 目前國內計算模擬團隊仍然欠缺，尤其是第一原理計算的人才欠
缺，我們應從材料教育的學程調整著手，培養新一代的材料計算
科學人才，並開始組織研究團隊進行薄膜材料設計與薄膜成長計
算模擬研究，以趕上先進國家在此方面的優勢，計算材料科學已
可看出其未來潛力，值得支持研究。

會議論文摘要一本。 
 
ings[6,7,9–11,13]. To produce oxynitride coatings, two reactive
working gases (N2 and O2) should be introduced. Due to the
higher reactivity of O2, the amount of O2 added to a depositing
process is usually less than that of N2. The incorporation of
oxygen leads to the formation of ionic metal-oxygen bonds in
the transition metal nitrides [14]. In the matrix of covalent
metal-nitride bonds, the newly forming bonds result in a new
structure with different properties, and thereby the color and the
mechanical properties are varied with the oxygen content [7].
The structure of TMeNxOy film is dependent on the oxygen
content which can be controlled by varying the oxygen flow rate
during deposition [6,9,11,15]. Vaz et al. [11] observed that the
TiNxOy thin film with low oxygen content (16 at.%) possesses a
crystalline TiN structure with (111) preferred orientation. As the
oxygen content increases, the crystallinity of the TiNxOy films
significantly decreases, and the structure becomes nearly
amorphous at oxygen content above 34 at.%. They suggested
that some of the oxygen atoms may occupy the nitrogen
positions in the TiN lattice [10]. The incorporation of oxygen
atoms creates an unknown Ti–N–O phase, which increases the
defect density and therefore facilitate amorphization [11].
Similar results were reported by Cunha et al. [7] in the study
of ZrNxOy thin films. They proposed that the possible insertions
of oxygen atoms in the ZrN crystalline lattice induces
nonuniform microstress and also introduces a new Zr–N–O
phase. They observed an unknown broadened peak in the XRD
patterns, which was suggested to be either the amorphization of
ZrN phase induced by the oxygen incorporation, or the
formation of an amorphous oxide [7,12].
Oxygen content also affects the coloration of TMeNxOy thin
films. Vaz et al. [11] found that the TiNxOy films with low
oxygen contents possess a bright golden yellow color. As the
oxygen content increases, the color shifts gradually to dark
golden yellow. For the higher oxygen-content specimens, the
color of the film is dark blue. In addition, they found that
deposition conditions, such as ion bombardment, will change
the microstructures of the samples with the same oxygen
contents and hence displaying different coloration [10]. They
concluded that the film color is significantly influenced by the
film structure.
The residual stress, hardness and electrical resistivity of the
TMeNxOy films are also affected by oxygen contents
[6,9,11,15–17]. Previous study suggested that the increase of
oxygen content increases the amorphization of the films and the
consequent loose packing structure may increase the relief of
the residual stress [11]. The hardness value decreases from the
typical value of TiN film at the lowest oxygen content to that of
TiO2 films at the highest oxygen content [11]. However,
Makino et al. [15] observed that by adding a small amount of
oxygen, the TiNxOy film reaches a maximum hardness and then
hardness decreases when the oxygen content further increases.
Similar results were obtained by Vaz et al. [16] on ZrNxOy thin
films. They believed that the distortion of the lattice caused by
the oxygen insertion may inhibit the mobility of the dislocations
J.-H. Huang et al. / Surface & Coatand lead to the increase of hardness. Chappe et al. [6] and Jung
et al. [17] have reported that the electrical resistivity of TiNxOy
films is very sensitive to the oxygen content. As the O2 flow rateincreases, the resistivity of the films increases significantly for
several orders of magnitude, which clearly shows the transition
from metallic TiN to resistive TiO2.
Applying substrate bias in the thin film deposition process
may alter not only oxygen content but also film microstructure.
The oxygen contents of the ZrNxOy films decrease with
increasing negative bias voltage [16], which may be due to
the increase of sputtering of oxygen adatoms by Ar ions [18].
Ion bombardment may effectively change the film structure.
Previous studies [11,16] observed that hardness of the unbiased
sample is significantly lower than that of the biased samples.
Without ion bombardment the grain growth is unconstrained,
which leads to porous and open columnar structures in the thin
film. By applying a negative bias, a more dense structure is
formed and hence increasing the film hardness. In addition, the
ion bombardment induced by substrate bias changes the film
structure and consequently affects the film color [11].
In the deposition of TMeNxOy, the defects may be formed
due to the substitution of nitrogen atoms by oxygen atoms.
Furthermore, oxygen or nitrogen atoms may insert into the
interstitial sites from ion bombardment. Heat treatment can
enhance the diffusion and annihilation of the defects and
thereby relieving the internal stress [19]. Cunha et al. [7]
performed heat treatment on ZrNxOy films and investigated the
structure evolution. The results showed that there is no
significant change in the composition and the coloration of
the ZrNxOy films after heat treatment. However, XRD peaks
from zirconium oxide phase appeared at temperatures above
600 °C. They suggested that the segregation of nitrogen and
oxygen atoms from interstitial sites to grain boundaries
promotes the formation of the tetragonal and the monoclinic
phases of zirconium oxides. The rearrangement of the
zirconium, nitrogen and oxygen atoms effectively reduces
lattice defects and hence relieving the stress. They also
speculated that ZrN phase is embedded in an amorphous or
Zr–N–O phase, which plays an important role in stress
relaxation. Carvalho et al. [12] found similar stress relief effect
by annealing ZrNxOy thin films. Regarding hardness, samples
with lower oxygen contents show insignificant changes after
hear treatment. They concluded that the compressive residual
stress is not the main factor that affects the hardness, but the
particular structural arrangement of the film is the most
important factor. For the samples with higher oxygen contents,
the hardness decreases after annealing, which is due to the
recovery of film structure.
Among the TMeNxOy films, due to relatively simple
processing, titanium oxynitride (TiNxOy) films become eminent
for its capability for decorative coatings [2]. On the other hand,
similar coating material ZrNxOy is less studied, especially when
produced by methods other than magnetron sputtering. This is
partly due to the fact that the vapor pressure of Zr is much lower
than Ti, and hence it is more difficult to deposit ZrN or ZrNxOy
films than TiN or TiNxOy films by evaporation-related physical
vapor deposition (PVD). Since ion plating can provide dense
6405Technology 201 (2007) 6404–6413packing, smooth surface and good adhesion between the
coating and substrate than other techniques [9,20], the method
was adopted in this study to deposit ZrNxOy films. The purpose
of ZrN(220) or ZrO2(111) at 9 different ψ angles by glancing
incident XRD were measured. The residual stresses of the ZrN
and the ZrO2 phases can be obtained from the slope of the linear
fitting using the following equation

thickness does not vary in accordance with increasing oxygen
flow rate. Fig. 3 reveals the cross-sectional SEM images of the
thin films with different oxygen contents. It can be seen that the
microstructure varies distinctly with increasing oxygen content.
The typical microstructure of ZrN, samples deposited at 0 and
2 sccm O2, is shown in Fig. 3(a), which displays columnar
structure with a column width less than 20 nm. Fig. 3(b) depicts
the SEM image of sample deposited at 4 sccm O2, where the
columnar structure no longer exists; instead, finer grain structure
is formed. Similar microstructure structure can be observed in
sample deposited at 3 sccm O2. The typical image of samples
deposited at 5 and 6 sccm O2 is shown in Fig. 3(c), where a
different microstructure displaying a long-fiber carpet-like
structure is observed, and the fine grain size is smaller than
10 nm. Fig. 3(d) shows the representative microstructure of
samples deposited at 7 and 8 sccm O2, which reveals a relatively
flat structure.

No. 8 (the sample deposited at 0 and 8 sccm O2 flow rates) were
used for the E values of ZrN and ZrO2 phases, respectively. The
optical method measured the difference in curvature of a sample
with and without deposited film. The residual stress of thin film
was calculated using the Stoney equation [26].
3. Results
The contents of Zr, N and O elements were obtained from the
integrated intensities of the Zr 3d, N 1s and O 1s peaks in XPS
spectra. Fig. 1 shows the variation of the element contents with
the increase of oxygen flow rate. The content of O increases
from 3.5 to 44.0 at.% while the content of N decreases from
41.7 to 21.0 at.% as the oxygen flow rate increases from 0 to
8 sccm. The content of N, dividing into two groups, decreases
significantly with the oxygen flow rate ranging from 0 to 4 sccm
and remains almost constant from 5 to 8 sccm. When the
oxygen flow rate is above 5 sccm, the content of O is larger than
that of N. The content of Zr also displays decreasing trend withFig. 1. The variation of element contents with O2 flow rate.increasing oxygen flow rate, but varies slightly at oxygen flow
rates ranging from 2 to 5 sccm.
The integrated intensities of the ZrN, Zr(NO) and ZrO2 peaks
from the deconvoluted Zr3d XPS spectra are used to calculate
the bond fraction. Fig. 2 shows the variation of bond fraction
with the increase of the oxygen content. Increasing the oxygen
content, the fraction of ZrO2 bond increases while the fraction
of ZrN bond decreases; by contrast, the fraction of Zr(NO) bond
changes less significantly.
The color of the specimen varies distinctly with increasing
oxygen flow rate or oxygen content. Starting from the typical
golden yellow of ZrN, with increasing oxygen flow rate, the
color gradually approaches golden brown (4 sccm O2). As the
oxygen flow rate increases to 5 sccm, the specimen displays
blue color. For the specimens deposited at higher oxygen flow
rates, the specimen color turns to dark blue and finally slate
blue.
The microstructure of the deposited films was observed using
SEM. The thickness of the film can be measured from the SEM
images and is listed in Table 1. The results show that the film

significantly than that in XPS; the O content is larger and the
N content is smaller than those in XPS analysis for the sample
deposited at 8 sccm O2.
The grain size of ZrN and m-ZrO2 phase can be estimated
from the full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of ZrN(111),
m-ZrO2 (111) and m-ZrO2 (020) peaks using Scherrer equation.
The results are listed in Table 1. The grain sizes of the two
phases are both in nano-scale. The grain sizes of ZrN are ranged
from 5 to 13 nm, and the grain sizes of m-ZrO2 phase are
smaller, ranging from 2 to 8 nm.
Fig. 7 shows the variation of film hardness with ZrO2
fraction. The hardness values, ranging from 27.8 to 15.7 GPa,
can be simply divided into three regions. In the region A,
the hardness increases slightly from 24.1 GPa to 27.8 GPa as
the ZrO2 fraction increasing from 0 to 8.5%. In the region B, the
ZrO2 fraction increases further from 8.5% to 38.3% while
the hardness significantly decreases from 27.8 to 16.4 GPa. In
the region C, the ZrO2 fraction increases from 38.3% to 77.0%
while the hardness values are almost constant and close to the
value of m-ZrO2 thin film. In general, the hardness of the
deposited films is substantially affected by the fraction of ZrO2
or the content of oxygen.

the microstructure, mechanical properties, and electrical
properties of the films. The structure, mechanism and the
related properties changes of the phase separation phenomenon
will be discussed.
Previous studies have not reported distinct phase separation
in the as-deposited ZrNxOy films, but the phase separation did
occur after the films were annealed at higher temperatures [7].
Cunha et al. [7] suggested that high annealing temperature
supplies enough energy for the migration of oxygen and
nitrogen atoms from interstitial sites to grain boundaries, which
leads to the formation of tetragonal or monoclinic zirconium
oxides. In this study, ZrNxOy thin films were deposited using
HCD-IP process, unlike magnetron sputtering used by the
previous authors [6,7,10–14], the HCD-IP system has a much
higher ionization efficiency (40–70%), which may facilitate
6411ings Technology 201 (2007) 6404–6413from 3.43 GPa to 0.83 GPa also occurs in the samples with ZrO2
fractions between 12.3% and 29.3%. The compressive stress
varies between 0.4 and 0.9 GPa as the ZrO2 fraction further
increases from 29.3% to 77.0% and with no specific trend.
Noted that as the ZrO2 fraction increases from 29.3% to 77.0%,
the values of compressive stress are no longer consistent with
those in the ZrN phase, but are close to the stresses in ZrO2
phase determined by the XRD method.
Fig. 9 shows the electrical resistivity of the samples with
respect to the fraction of ZrO2 phase. The pure ZrN sample (No. 1)
possesses a quite low electrical resistivity of 37.3 μΩ-cm. When
the ZrO2 fraction increases to 12.3%, the resistivity increases
about 5 to 8 times. A rapid increase of resistivity occurs between
the sample No. 4 and 5, with ZrO2 fraction of 12.3% and 29.3%,
respectively. The samples with ZrO2 fraction of 29.3% (No.5) and
38.3% (No.6) have the resistivities of 3645.4 and 3285.7 μΩ-cm,
respectively. Another sharp increase of resistivity occurs as
the ZrO2 fraction increases from 38.3% to 54.3%, up to
1.1×105 μΩ-cm, and the resistivity of the sample No. 8, with
ZrO2 fraction of 77.0%, is 1.9×10
7 μΩ-cm.
4. Discussion
In this study, ZrN and ZrNxOy thin films were successfully
deposited on Si wafers using HCD-IP method. The flow rate of
oxygen was chosen as the single variable in the deposition
process. As shown in Fig. 1, the oxygen content of the thin film
determined using XPS is significantly influenced by the oxygen
flow rate. Increasing the oxygen flow rate, the oxygen content
of the ZrNxOy film increases and hence leading to the
occurrence of the phase separation phenomenon.
Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the deconvoluted XRD patterns. Two
phases, ZrN and m-ZrO2, can be clearly identified in the
patterns. The ZrO2 bonding fraction from XPS, as shown in
Fig. 2, also supports that there are ZrN and ZrO2 bondings in the
samples. In addition, XPS results show the existence of Zr(NO)
bonding, about 20%, which varies slightly with increasing
oxygen content. As shown in Fig. 5, the phase separation
phenomenon occurs when the oxygen flow rate is higher than
3 sccm, corresponding to 9.7% of oxygen content.
The fractions of ZrO2 and ZrN phases can be estimated from
XRD spectra and the atomic percentages of Zr, N and O
elements can also be calculated from the phase fractions. The
atomic percentage from XRD with respect to the oxygen flow
rate is shown in Fig. 6. Comparing the Zr, N, and O ratios from
the two methods, XRD and XPS, it can be found that the trends
are similar, except that the atomic percentages of N are smaller
while those of O are larger in XRD than that in XPS at high
oxygen flow rates. The disparities may be due to different
sources where the compositions were acquired. The composi-
tions determined by XPS are from those atoms that have ZrN,
ZrO2 or Zr(NO) bondings. On the other hand, the compositions
derived from XRD are from the atoms that are in ZrO2 and ZrN
crystalline phases, while the atoms with Zr(NO) bondings are
J.-H. Huang et al. / Surface & Coatnot included due to no crystalline phase formation.
The phase separation phenomenon occurring at O N9.7% is
an important finding in this study, which significantly affectshigh flux ion impingement. The high deposition temperature
(450 °C) and the high flux ion impingement during deposition
process may enhance the mobility of the adatoms and thereby
promoting the phase separation. As proposed by the earlier
study [7], the excess oxygen atoms may segregate at grain
boundaries. In a ZrN unit cell, Zr atoms locate on the FCC
lattice sites and N atoms fill in the octahedral sites. Since O
atoms are too large to be inserted into the interstitial sites of ZrN
lattice, they presumably tend to substitute N atoms. This is
evidenced in Figs. 1 and 6, which shows that as oxygen flow
rate increases, the N content decreases and the O content
increases. Moreover, as the oxygen content increases, the
substitution of O atoms into N sites of the ZrN lattice may
distort the lattice and thereby decrease the crystallinity of ZrN.
This is supported by the XRD spectra shown in Fig. 4(a) and
(b), where the FWHM of ZrN(111) peak mostly increases with
increasing oxygen flow rate, indicating that the crystallinity of
ZrN decreases with oxygen flow rate.
Since O atoms tend to segregate at grain boundaries [7], the
total number of N atom sites located at grain boundaries can be
assumed to be the upper limit that can be substituted by O
atoms. Suppose that the shape of ZrN grain is cubic, as shown in
Fig. 10, where G is the average grain size determined using
XRD, L is the lattice parameter of ZrN, and m is the number ofFig. 10. Schematic diagram of the simplified cubic ZrN grains.
