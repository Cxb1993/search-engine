Electro-phoretic deposition (EPD) is employed to make the 
photocatalyst metallic filter net.  By means of EPD, the improved TiO2 
nanophotocatalytic fluid proposed is evenly spread on the stainless 
steel filter net.  Then the net is sintered at high temperature so as for 
strengthening the connection between the coating layer and the 
stainless steel base material.  Since coating and sintering cannot be 
conducted easily on the filter net of larger area, the study further 
proposes the concept of “using small filter nets to form a large filter 
net.”  The small filter nets are fixed on the assembled frames.  In 
this way, the photocatalyst filter net is applicable to the equipments of 
different geometric shapes and sizes.

1.前言 
目前市面上的空氣清淨機，以活性碳
吸附方式最為普遍，但是活性碳吸附的缺
點為用在高溫高濕的條件下，其吸附的效
率會下降；且吸附的產物並非被分解殆
盡，所以有造成二次汙染環境的風險。而
目前處理有機氣體的技術中，採用低成
本、無汙染且可重複使用的光觸媒催化方
式來分解室內揮發性有機混合物。 
光觸媒催化技術，於 1972 年由
Fujishima 和 Honda[1]兩位日本教授所提
出，這兩位學者研究以 n 型半導體 TiO2
為電極，在特定光線照射下(λ<415 奈米)
激發 TiO2，發現在水的電解製氫有催化之
現象，相當於將光能轉變成化學能，當
TiO2表面吸附著水氣與空氣；光催化時會
產生電子與電洞，水分子與電洞進行氧化
反應產生氫氧自由基(OH)與過氧基等活
性氧(O2)成分，而氫氧自由基能氧化分解
有機氣體、微生物或細菌。而傳統的抗菌
表面處理[2]之薄膜之製作方式，常見的有
噴塗(spray coat)、旋鍍(spin coat)、浸鍍
(dipping coat)、濺鍍(sputtering)、滾輪塗佈
(roll coat)、通電氧化膜、熱氧化膜與噴塗
法等方式，而本研究使用製膜方式為電泳
沉積法(electrophoretic deposition，EPD)。
電泳沉積法於 1740年由印度科學家G. M. 
Bose 從液體虹吸管(liquid-siphon)實驗中
發現電泳現象。1807 年俄國科學家 F. F. 
Reuss 發現於黏土懸浮液中外加一電場
時，黏土顆粒會往陽極方向游離。然後於
1924 年 Hucke 推出電雙層理論在電雙層
厚度非常厚時之電泳速度，並了解速度受
到外加電場或表面電位的影響。1982 年
Choundhary 等學者以水系懸浮液沉積氧
化陶瓷材料。1988年 Clark等學者以氧化
鋁溶液沉積在鋁合金機板上。由於電泳沉
積法具設備要求低、操作製成容易、沉積
速率快、品質控制容易及可用材料眾多等
優點，因此已逐漸被各界應用。 
文獻中，Johann Cho等人[3]使用電泳
沉積的方式將奈米碳管(carbon nanotube)
與 TiO2披覆合成為一奈米結構。合成之薄
膜是使用電泳沉積方式結合在直徑範圍
為 20-30奈米的多層奈米碳管與商業上常
用的 TiO2 奈米粉末。採用連續電泳的方
式，奈米碳管與 TiO2的合成薄膜可電泳披
覆至四層，使用掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察薄
膜，發現兩層電泳時沉積於不銹鋼濾網之
薄膜品質佳並且 TiO2介面層強度高，但是
四層電泳披覆的薄膜則有裂縫產生。 
Maria等人[4]對於奈米電泳懸浮液特
性研究，發現要有成功的電泳沉積現象，
懸浮液的流變行為極為重要，研究中以
TiO2 奈米粉末與乙基丙酮(acetylacetone)
在沒有添加碘(iodine)，調配成電泳懸浮
液，結果顯示調配濃度為 1重量百分比的
懸浮液之流變行為有剪變稀的現象且電
泳沉積於不銹鋼板上效果理想，其他濃度
皆有剪變厚現象。而若是添加碘時，調配
成濃度為重量百分比的懸浮液之流變行
為有剪變厚的現象。而且將濃度為重量百
分比的懸浮液調配成 pH=5、電泳時間 2
分鐘且採固定電壓 10~15伏特的方式可獲

3.研究設備與方法 
3.1二氧化鈦奈米粉末基本性質分析 
本研究中所使用之二氧化鈦奈米粉
末為商用 Degussa P25二氧化鈦，首先以
微量天評量取 12.8 公克的二氧化鈦奈米
粉末並加入於 4000 毫升之異丙醇，調配
成濃度為 3.2(公克/公升)之二氧化鈦電泳
懸浮液[9]，並以超音波震盪器震盪兩小時
以上，使二氧化鈦粒子均勻分散於異丙醇
溶液中。為了避免實驗過程中懸浮液靜置
時，有團聚沉澱的現象發生，所以每次電
泳之前皆必須再以超音波震盪器，分散懸
浮液中之粒子。本研究使用穿透式電子顯
微鏡 (Transmission Electron Microscope, 
TEM)來觀察二氧化鈦奈米顆粒形狀。 
 
二氧化鈦的晶體結構中以銳鈦礦
(Anatase)的光催化活性效果最佳，為了瞭
解 Degussa P25奈米粉末在經過高溫燒結
處理後是否會影響其晶體構造，分別取微
量的 Degussa P25 奈米粉末置於鐵缽之
中，再放入高溫燒結爐中各以 100、200、
300、400、500、600及 700℃燒結四小時
後，再以X光繞射分析儀(X-ray diffraction, 
XRD)作晶體結構分析，觀察 Degussa P25
奈米顆粒隨著燒結溫度上升其晶構造是
否有所改變。 
 
3.2二氧化鈦光觸媒濾網製作方式 
電泳沉積法製備二氧化鈦薄膜，其步
驟如下： 
(1) 將孔徑為 2mm 之不鏽鋼沖孔濾網，
剪裁為長度 21公分與寬度 21公分之
尺寸。 
(2) 不鏽鋼沖孔濾網以酒精(ethanol)清洗
乾淨後，烘乾備用。 
(3) 異丙醇中加入 Degussa P25二氧化鈦
奈米粉末調配成濃度為 3.2(公克/公
升)的電泳懸浮液，再以超音波震盪
器震盪兩小時使其分散均勻。 
(4) 電泳過程中所選用之電極，陰極為不
鏽鋼濾網，陽極為不鏽鋼板，兩極之
間的距離固定為 15公厘，將懸浮液
置於電泳槽之中，並以直流電源供應
器給予固定電壓 40伏特，在電泳過
程中將電泳槽置於 5℃的恆溫冰水槽
中，如圖 3所示，電泳完成後，將不
鏽鋼濾網放入高溫燒結爐中燒結，如
圖 4所示，即完成二氧化鈦光觸媒濾
網製作。

3.3實驗變數對電泳披覆薄膜的影響 
光催化效果的好壞，披覆的均勻程度
是一個重要指標，因此本實驗將探討改變
各種實驗變數下，對於使用電泳沉積法披
覆二氧化鈦濾網的薄膜會產生什麼影
響，改變的實驗變數如下： 
(1) pH值的影響：將硫酸(H2SO4)加入去
離子水稀釋 100倍後，將稀釋後的硫
酸以 0.1毫升的微量針筒滴入配置完
成的二氧化鈦懸浮液中來改變懸浮
液的 pH 值，其設定的 pH 值分別為
  8 
(a) pH=1 (b) pH=2
(c) pH=3 (d) pH=4
(e) pH=5 (f) pH=6
(g) pH=7  
圖 6 電泳懸浮液之粒徑圖 
 
4.3燒結溫度對薄膜表面之觀察 
將Degussa P25二氧化鈦與異丙醇調
配成電泳懸浮液，利用電泳沉積的方式使
二氧化鈦披覆在不銹鋼濾網上，並將電泳
完成的濾網放入高溫燒結爐中，分別以
300、400、500、600及700℃的溫度做燒
結。圖7為顯示不同溫度燒結下的SEM薄
膜圖，圖7(a)為以300℃燒結的薄膜表面情
形，其表面均勻程度不明顯並且有細微的
龜裂產生，而圖7中(c)、(d)、(e)圖呈現的
現象是當燒結溫度越高，出現龜裂現象機
率越多，且龜裂程度也越來越大，這種現
象是說明使用懸浮液製作薄膜的陶瓷化
過程中，當溫度越來越高，使得溶液蒸發
與乾燥速度加快，實驗中所使用的懸浮溶
液分別是用二氧化鈦及異丙醇所調配製
作，乾燥蒸發速度並不相同，進而產生薄
膜龜裂現象，為了避免這種現象產生，建
議以燒結溫度400℃作為製作二氧化鈦光
觸媒薄膜的溫度。 
(a)300℃ (b)400℃
(c)500℃ (d)600℃
(e)700℃  
圖7 不同燒結溫度電泳薄膜圖 
 
4.4電泳時間對薄膜表面與厚度之分析 
本研究電泳時間分別以1、3、5、7及
9分鐘做為電泳的時間，電泳後的沉積厚
度如圖8所示說明，電泳1分鐘之厚度為
12.656微米、3分鐘之厚度為28.313微米、
5分鐘之厚度為38.906微米、7分鐘之厚度
為61.875微米、9分鐘之厚度為68.438微
米，現象說明沉積厚度隨電泳時間增加而
變厚。圖9顯示以不同電泳時間，並在燒
結溫度為400℃時薄膜披覆情形，圖9(a)
顯示的是電泳時間為1分鐘的SEM圖其薄
膜披覆並不均勻，圖9(b)顯示3分鐘的電泳
下有出現龜裂的情形，圖9(c)顯示5分鐘的
電泳下雖有細微裂縫但是薄膜披覆均

4.5懸浮液pH值對薄膜表面之分析 
電泳過程中懸浮液若越呈現鹼性現
象則粒子就越不易沉積披覆於不銹鋼濾
網上；是因為懸浮液 pH 值若呈現酸性，
懸浮液中的弱基酸越不容易解離，因此胺
基酸呈現正電荷狀態，而懸浮液 pH 值若
呈成鹼性，懸浮液中的弱基酸越容易解
離，因此胺基酸呈現負電荷狀態。所以本
實驗將 Degussa P25二氧化鈦與異丙醇調
配成電泳懸浮液，首先量測電泳懸浮液的
原始 pH值，測得結果 pH值約為 7.6，利
用硫酸 (H2SO4)將電泳懸浮液配製成
pH=1~pH=7的酸鹼值，並使用電泳沉積的
方式將懸浮液的二氧化鈦粒子披覆在不
銹鋼濾網上。圖 10所顯示的是在不同 pH
值之電泳懸浮液並且燒結溫度為 400℃
時，使用 SEM 拍攝的薄膜圖，觀察結果
顯示當懸浮液的 pH 值越呈現酸性時，其
薄膜的均勻程度越不顯著並且還會出現
薄膜龜裂，雖然懸浮液 pH 值呈現酸性容
易電泳沉積，但是硫酸會腐蝕懸浮液中的
粒子，進而影響披覆的均勻程度，所以建
議以 pH=7作為電泳懸浮液的酸鹼值。

Abstract This paper prepares different filters of TiO2 photocatalyst by Electrophoretic
Deposition (EPD). The crystalline structure of TiO2 film/steel samples was observed using the
XRD and SEM. Scratch tests reveal favorable interconnection of nanoparticles as well as
significantly higher adhesion to the filter substrate. Regarding the testing procedures, major
devices applied for the measurement method developed by this study were UV/VIS
spectrophotometer and quartz cuvette. The experimental procedures were not only simple but
also fast. In the experiment, specific kind of gas of a concentration was first injected into an
enclosed quartz cuvette, which is then placed in the UV/VIS spectrophotometer to carry out
tests to obtain an absorption spectrum. A calibration curve of UV light absorbance intensity vs.
various gaseous concentrations can also be obtained by using the same method. The
degradation efficiency of the photocatalysts was to be measured. The TiO2 filters were then
placed in cuvette. After injecting Toluene into a quartz cuvette, the cuvette is put under the
UV light irradiation to perform the degradation experiment. Afterwards, the cuvette was
transferred to the UV/VIS spectrophotometer for testing. The absorbance intensity of the
absorption spectra was then compared with the calibration curves. Based on the change of
the gaseous concentration, the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst is determined. The
experimental results reveal that the TiO2 nanocatalyst had excellent degradation efficiency
towards Toluene. When Toluene is exposed to UV irradiation for 60 minutes, the gaseous
concentration can be reduced to no more than 10% of the original concentration. In addition,
the degradation reaction rate constant of the TiO2 nanocatalyst towards Toluene was as high
as 0.018 min-1.
Where " ak " is the reaction rate constant.
There are many ways to determine the concentration of gaseous compounds in the air. Such
as: GC/ MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy), Raman spectra instruments, chemoluminescence instruments, tunable diode
laser absorption spectroscopy/NIR TDLAS/NIR techniques. The principles of each type of
instrument are also different. The main instrument used for this study is a VU/VIS
spectrophotometer quipped with a quartz cuvette. The experimental procedures are simple and
fast. Our results prove that our simple and convenient methods are new techniques for sample
pre-treatment and the measurement of TiO2 photocatalyst photo-degradation efficiency.
2. Experimental details
For detection, a fixed-gas analysis device equipped UV/VIS spectrophotometer
(Thermo) with a wavelength range of 190~1100 nm was used. Quartz cuvettes（Hellma),
volume 3 mL, UV light tube for irradiation of quartz cuvette was a Japanese-made 254 nm
tube, luminance 0.30mW/cm2; as fig. 1. Sample treatment technique: 0.001 mL samples of
various concentrations of liquid Toluene, were injected into separate quartz colorimetric
troughs, then heated to 50 to vaporize the℃ Toluene. Then each quartz colorimetric trough
was transferred to the spectrophotometer for UV exposure, as fig. 2. At the same time, the
spectrophotometer was heated to 50 in a thermostat tank℃ to avoid condensation of Toluene
in the quartz cuvettes. After the measurement, the absorption spectra diagram of Toluene at
various concentrations was obtained. The photocatalyst filters(L30mm×W7mm, ψ
=1.5mm) used in this experiment was a nanofluid TiO2, which was prepared by EPD method
with the commercial photocatalyst powder. Quartz glass substrates was coated with nanofluid
TiO2, and then baked at 400 . This process was repeated three times in order to fix the TiO℃ 2
onto the quartz glass substrates. Then the different photocatalyst-coated quartz glass
substrates were inserted into separate quartz cuvettes. Each quartz cuvette was then
transferred to the UV/VIS spectrophotometer to investigate the influence of various
intermediate product might make the organic substances of low volatility compulsorily
absorbed on the surface of catalyst. Only after the temperature exceeded 220℃ could the
intermediate product be obviously oxidized, desorbed or decomposed. Therefore, under the
experiment’s designed condition of 50 , ℃ TiO2 photocatalysis could not obviously decompose
the intermediate product of toluene. Fig. 5 shows the possibility of direct photolysis by
ultraviolet under the condition of no TiO2 photocatalyst. Since the C-H, C-C and C＝C bonds
in toluene might destroy the maximum wavelengths of bonding, being 289.7, 346.1 and
196.1nm respectively [9], and the bond C＝C (196.1 nm) was smaller than the UVC
wavelength 253.7 nm used in this experiment, so the possibility of direct photolysis under the
illuminaion of light at wavelength 253.7 nm was not high. However, this experiment
showed that it could destroy the bonding.
4. Conclusions
This paper maked efficiency of photocatalytic decomposition of gaseous toluene
between the use TiO2 nanoparticles. In termd of the design of experiment, it was a
simple and convenient measurement method to evaluate the result of photocatalysis.
The major deviced of the experiment were only ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer
and quart cuvette, and the procedures of experiment are simple and fast. After 60-min
photocomposition, TiO2 reduced the concentration of gaseous toluene to 10%. Fig. 5
shows that the rate constant of photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles for Toluene using
eq. (2) was 0.018min-1.

Abstract The paper combined TiO2 photocatalyst with stainless steel filters by using
electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to make TiO2 firmly fixed on the surface of stainless steel
filter. As to the mode of photocatalyst TiO2 filters, few pieces of 100-AiM stainless steel filter
were prepared. The filers were immersed in TiO2 solutions, the concentrations were 3.2, 4.8
and 6.4g/L, and the three different pH values measured were 4, 5 and 6. The application of
EPD was processed for the deposition of a crystalline coating of titanium dioxide onto fine
particles, which were then calcined at 400 - 700℃ for 30 minutes. The crystalline structure of
TiO2 film samples had been studied using the XRD and the results showed that it was apt to
make the surface form the carbon dreg when temperature was higher. Scratch tests revealed
favorable interconnection of the titanium nanoparticles as well as significantly higher
adhesion to the stainless steel filter substrate. The SEM was observed, and resulted that at
450℃, 3.2 g/L and pH 3, the particle was under the most favorable electrophoretic condition.
Keywords：EPD, TiO2 photocatalyst, stainless steel filters
1. Introduction
The phenomenon of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) refers to the flowing phenomenon of
charged particles in suspension liquid driven by the externally added electric field. Its
flowing with the externally added electric current in opposite or parallel direction is subject to
the electric charge carried by the particles. Ultimately, the particles will be deposited on the
anode or cathode surface. In 1808, Russian physician, Reuss [1] was the first person having
discovered electrophoresis phenomenon. In 1948, Tisulins [2] used electrophoresis to separate
different kinds of proteins. In 1998, Russ and Talbot [3] studied the phosphorous material on
base plate (length 10mm × width 7mm, ψ= 1.5mm) in order to avoid the phenomenon of
absorbance on the base plate. Besides, TiO2 thin film could not fall off easily, and could be
distributed evenly. The voltages of electrophoretic work (voltages at 30, 40 and 70) took
stainless steel plate as the anode, and stainless steel filter as the cathode. The distance
between the two electrodes was fixed at 15mm. The suspension liquid was placed in the
electrophoresis tank. Fixed voltage electrophoresis was externally added for 5 minutes.
After it was placed in a tank with icy water at 5℃, the stainless steel filter was placed in an
oven for sintering, and then the experiment was completed.
3. Experimental results and discussion
Regarding the experiment of crystalline structure, as known from fig. 2, when the
temperature of heat treatment increased to 700℃, nanopowder still kept its anatase crystalline
phase. Under sintering treatment at the temperature of 700℃, the photocatalytic activity of
nanopowder still remained. After electrophoretic processing, SEM was used to observe how
the suspension liquids of 3 different concentrations formed thin film coating on the surface of
stainless steel filter. As seen from fig. 3, the coating at the concentration of 4.8 g/L had more
obvious fissure than that of 3.2 g/L. As the concentration of suspension liquid increased, the
chances for fissures to appear on electrophoretic thin film coating would be increased. In
the electrophoresis process, an extremely fast temperature rise would lead to the rapid
volatilization of solvent, and produce fissures on the thin film coating easily. The faster the
drying speed, the thicker the coating. Accordingly, the greater the residual stress, the greater
the fissures produced. Between base plate and coating, the coefficients of thermal expansion
were different, so fissures would also be produced [5, 6]. In general application, fissures
would reduce the efficiency of photocatalysis.
As seen from the SEM diagram of thin film under the sintering temperatures of 400℃ and
450℃, more obvious fissures appeared on the thin film coating under sintering at 450℃ than
that at 400℃. In other words, an excessively low or excessively high temperature of heat
conditions, except Figure 5(c), all other thin films had obvious fissures on their surfaces. As
shown in the SEM diagram in Fig. 6, when the surface of coating at pH3 was compared with
the coating of EPD of suspension liquid at the original pH value, obvious fissures could still
be found, and the coating situation on the thin film surface could not be effectively improved.
Its reason might be that HCl would corrode TiO2 particles, influence the coating of particles,
and furthermore affect the coating situation on the thin film surface.
4. Conclusion
This paper showed that it was apt to make the surface form the carbon dreg when temperature
was higher. Tests revealed favorable interconnection of the titanium nanoparticles as well as
significantly higher adhesion to the stainless steel filter substrate. The SEM was observed,
and resulted that at 450℃, 3.2 g/L and pH 3, the particle was under the most favorable
electrophoretic condition. The experiment takes stainless steel punch filters as the reaction
base plate in order to avoid the phenomenon of absorbance on the base plate.

5. Introduction
The most common pollutant of an indoor environment is formaldehyde (HCHO).
Formaldehyde is usually originated from smoking and decoration materials [1]. When
studying and measuring the concentration of Formaldehyde indoors, Matthews et al [2] find
that based on the average temperature and relative humidity in summer and winter the
formaldehyde concentration in summer is 6 to 9 times of that in winter. It can be transmitted
through the staircase and the hallways outside the elevators, and even extended to different
stories of office buildings [3].
It is studied that formaldehyde can be removed by photocatalyst [4]. According to the
results of an experiment of photocatalyst-attached air cleaner done by Zhang et al. [5], the
formaldehyde removal efficiency is 70 ~ 80%, and the toluene removal efficiency is 35 ~
40%. Esswein et al. [6] report that the ozone-attached air cleaner has poor formaldehyde
removal efficiency. Ao et al. [7] finds out from a study that the volume of pollutants absorbed
by activated carbon decreases with the rise of temperature. Therefore, the condition of high
temperature is unfavorable to the absorption of pollutants [8].
The paper combines TiO2 photocatalyst with stainless steel filters, by using chemical binder
to make TiO2 firmly fixed on the surface of stainless steel filter. When the fiber-made filter is
testing the air and dust passing through the load filter, it is found that the gases of
formaldehyde and acetone are produced, and the dispersion increases day by day. Hence, it is
supposed that the dispersion is caused by the activities of microorganism in the greenhouse
and the accumulation of these gases on the fiber-made filter [9]. Therefore, the study uses
stainless steel filter, which will tremendously improve this shortcoming, and will not cause
the pollution and propagation of pathogenic bacteria for the second time.

3.2 Humidity Effect
As indicated in the related researches, water occupies a rather important position in
photocatalysis. The increase of photocatalytic humidity may facilitate, suppress, or firstly
facilitate and then suppress the photocatalysis. Although the effect of photocatalytic humidity
on photocatalysis had been extensively investigated by scholars, the influence of humidity
under different photocatalytic temperatures still had not been deeply investigated and
understood. Hence, the studied focuses the investigation on the influence of water on the
photocatalytic efficiency of formaldehyde under different photocatalytic temperatures. As
shown in fig. 4, when the temperature was 22oC and the humidity were 40, 50 and 60%RH,
the actual photodegradation rates were 38.36, 43.86 and 49.98% respectively; and when the
temperature was 25oC, the actual photodegradation rates were 40.6, 47.77 and 51.39%
respectively. From these results, it was known that when the temperature and humidity were
both increased, the photodegradation rate will be increased accordingly.
3.3 The circulated wind velocity Effect
In the formaldehyde photocatalysis experiment by TiO2 nanocatalyst with the circulated
wind velocities and the preset temperature being 22oC, the actual photocatalytic removal rate
was 36.17-46.11%. When the preset temperature was 25oC, the actual photocatalytic removal
rate was 36.42-51.93%. As known from fig. 5, under the conditions of wind velocity at 1.3m/s
and the temperature at 25oC, the photocatalysis of formaldehyde had a better degradation
effect. The experimental results revealed that the photocatalytic rate of formaldehyde rise
with the increase of wind velocity. Since the photocatalysis of formaldehyde mainly relies on
the photocatalytic contact between formaldehyde and the surface of the film of
nano-photocatalytic agent, when the duration for the contact of formaldehyde pollutants with
the surface of the film of photocatalytic agent was sufficient, the circulated wind velocity will
be greater, and the number of times of circulation within the fixed time of photocatalysis will
