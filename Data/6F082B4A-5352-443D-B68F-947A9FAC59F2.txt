large neck flexion and gaze angle for the 
two laptops. Besides, significantly large 
neck flexion angle, gaze angle, and muscular 
loads were reported for the 12 inch laptop 
compared with the other two types of 
computers. The desktop PC with 15 inch 
monitor was found with the smallest neck 
flexion and gaze angles and the muscular 
loads.

1. Introduction 
 
Owing to the space limit the standing 
visual display terminal (VDT) workstation 
was necessary and can not be replaced by 
sitting VDT workstation in practice at some 
workplaces such as the semiconductor 
fabrication cleaning room. The standing 
workstation was usually equipped with 
laptop personal computers (PCs). The guides 
or recommendations for standing VDT 
workstation were few. Only 
recommendation based on standing elbow 
height was reported. Besides, most laptop 
PCs are designed with the screen hinged to 
the keyboard and are non-detachable, 
resulting in an increase in neck flexion, 
torque and physical discomfort [1,2,3]. The 
elbow-height based recommendation for 
stand VDT workstation equipped with 
laptop PC will still possibly result in the 
neck/shoulder discomfort because of the 
lower monitor height. We wonder that, for 
laptop PC, will the operators prefer to set the 
keyboard height higher than their elbow 
height to reduce the large neck flexion and 
gaze angle. Though, in opposite, this might 
increase the upper arm and shoulder 
muscular efforts. 
Therefore, aims of this research project 
are to evaluate the preferred settings for 
standing VDT workstation especially for 
laptop PC and the associated postural and 
workstation settings and muscular loads.  
 
 
1.1.Objectives 
 
Specific aims of the study were to 
explore the preferred postural and 
workstation settings for two laptop PC and 
one desktop PC as the control by employing 
a self design electrically adjustable standing 
VDT workstation. The factor of initial desk 
height settings of the adjustable VDT 
workstation which may affect the preferred 
settings [4] was encompassed. 
Electromyogram and dynamic 
single/two-axis goniometer were utilized to 
evaluate the associated muscular loads and 
postural settings for the upper extremity. 
 
1.2.Relevance to industry 
 
Laptop computers have become widely 
used in many workplaces and are currently 
the largest growth area within the PC market. 
There has been substantial research carried 
out to evaluate the effects of desktop PC 
working on a sitting VDT workstation for 
the associated work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders (WMSDs). Therefore, in the laptop 
PC the issues of comfort, adjustability and 
ergonomics are also important to avoid 
foreseeable ergonomics and occupational 
health problems [5,2]. This study is unique 
as for the first time the preferred settings and 
muscular loads of standing VDT workstation 
will be explored especially for laptop PC.

The centre of the cable of the sensor were 
placed at the centre of the measured joint 
with the landmarks as seventh cervical 
vertebra (C7), lateral epicondyle of the 
humerus, and acromion respectively. For 
gaze angle the landmarks were eyeball and 
the centre of video display. The preferred 
desk height for placing mouse/keyboard was 
defined as the preferred height of the desk to 
the floor. 
 
2.4. Task 
 
The experiment task was a screen-based 
data entry task (see Fig. 2). Subjects were 
required to enter random text characteristics 
(including upper and lower case alphabet 
and number) at random assigned positions. 
The entered text was similar to the bar-code 
frequently used in industry. For laptop PC 
touch pad and keyboard were used and for 
desktop PC keyboard and mouse were used. 
 
2.5. Procedure 
 
Each subject conducted six sessions of 
experiment. The experiment period for each 
condition was about 15 to 20 minutes. Prior 
to performing the task of each session, 
subjects were offered five to ten minutes of 
familiarisation period on the computer. 
During this time subjects adjusted the desk 
height, monitor tilt, and monitor height (for 
desktop PC only) to their preferred settings. 
Subjects were given assistance in how to use 
the equipment adjustments but were given 
no information on recommended posture. 
Only when subjects had achieved their 
preferred posture did they begin the 
following 5 minutes of formal task and 
another five minutes of rest. Subjects were 
not allowed to sit down before they 
completed the whole six sessions of 
experiments. To avoid order effects, the 
sequence for the six sessions of experiments 
were randomized. 
The sampling frequency for dynamic 
goniometers and sEMG was both as 200 Hz. 
Full wave rectifying and filtering of the 
sEMG signal derived the muscular activity, 
using a time constant of 100ms. The 50th 
(median level) percentile of the muscle 
activity was then calculated for each muscle 
group. The maximum voluntary contraction 
force was measured before the formal 
experiments. The %MVC values were 
derived for further statistical analyses. 
It has been concerned if the preferred 
settings measured within a short time in the 
laboratory would be similar to the preferred 
settings measured under the practical 
conditions of daily VDT work. Grandjean et 
al. [7] conducted a four-day field study to 
assess the preferred settings under the 
practical conditions of daily VDT work. The 
results from these four days showed no 
noticeable differences. 
 
2.6. Statistical analysis 
 
 6
Regarding the postural setting, both neck 
angle and gaze angle were significantly 
affected by type of computers and initial 
settings (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The 
interactions between the two independent 
variables for neck and haze angle were not 
significant. Post pairwise comparison based 
on estimated marginal mean showed that the 
subjects’ neck flexion angles whilst using 
desktop PC were significantly smaller than 
the two types of laptop PCs. The differences 
of neck flexion angle between the two 
laptops were not significant. Further 
posterior pairwise comparisons also showed 
that the differences of subjects’ gaze angle 
among the three types of computers were all 
significant. 
The upper flexion angle was 
significantly affected by type of computer 
(see Table 2). Fig. 6 illustrates that the upper 
arm flexion angle for desktop PC is lower 
compared with those of the two laptop PCs. 
The muscular loads for the five 
measured muscles were all significantly 
affected by the type of computer and only 
the muscular load on left trapezius muscle 
was significantly affected by initial setting 
(see Table 2). Table 3 further illustrates that 
subjects had smaller muscular loads whilst 
working with the desktop PC compared with 
the two laptop PCs. The subjects’ muscular 
loads whilst working with the 12.1-inch 
laptop PC is highest compared with the 
14-inch laptop and desktop PC as shown in 
Table 3.

12.1-inch laptop PC is larger compared with 
the other two types of computers. The 
desktop PC with 15 inch monitor was found 
with the smallest muscular loads. Except for 
the minor effects of larger neck flexion 
angle on the muscular loads of left and right 
trapezius, the significant larger upper arm 
flexion angle and larger upper arm 
abduction angle (thorough not significant) 
may be the main reason (see Table 2 and 
Table 3). By further examining the recorded 
videotape and discussing with some of the 
subjects, we found subjects work with larger 
upper arm flexion and abduction angle 
because of the smaller size of the keyboard 
of the 12.1 inch laptop compared with the 
14-inch laptop and 15-inch desktop PC. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This study has featured some of the 
concerns affiliated to working on standing 
VDT workstation especially for laptop PC. 
Although the preferred desk height is 
independent of the utilized computer type as 
reported in our study, individual differences 
in visual and musculoskeletal systems make 
it unlikely that a single desk height of the 
standing VDT work station existed that is 
optimal for all users. However there is no 
doubt that whilst working on standing VDT 
workstation, desktop PC which can allow 
better adjustability of screen height is better 
compared with the laptop PC and that laptop 
PC with smaller screen should be avoided 
from prolonged use on the standing VDT 
workstation.
