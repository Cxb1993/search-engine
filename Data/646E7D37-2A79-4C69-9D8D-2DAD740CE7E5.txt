Abstract:  
 In the second year of this project, we consider the 
problems of minimal network usage networked feedback 
robust controller design for polytopic systems. For static 
scheduling case, we find an upper bound for the time slot in a 
specified period that the shared network should be allocated to 
a polytopic NCSs to guarantee robust stability. For periodic 
transmission networked feedback polytopic control systems, 
we derive a formula for verifying an upper bound for the 
allowable transmission period. For non-periodic transmission 
networked feedback polytopic control systems, based on the 
transmission-if-necessary scheme, we develop a formula to 
determine whether the current measured data should be 
transmitted to the networked controller. Finally, for 
model-based networked feedback polytopic control systems, 
we derive several sufficient conditions for the robust stability. 
 
 
I、INTRODUCTION 
A feedback control system with feedback loop 
closing through a real-time network is called a 
networked control system (NCS, please see [3]-[27]). 
The information in a NCS is exchanged using a network 
among control system components (sensors, controller, 
and actuators). For a complicated control system, there 
are many sensors and actuators spreading in different 
places. If the sensors and actuators are connected 
directly to the controller by traditional method 
(point-to-point connection), it will have the drawbacks 
of large amount of system wiring, difficulty in system 
diagnosing and maintaining, and lack of agility. For 
networked control systems, all sensors and actuators are 
connected to the controller by a shared network (see Fig. 
1). Comparing to the traditional direct connection 
control systems, NCSs have the advantages of reducing 
system wiring, ease system diagnosis and maintenance, 
and increasing system flexibility [27].  
In the second year of this project we consider the 
control problems for networked polytopic control 
systems. We want to design networked feedback 
controllers with minimal network usage to achieve 
robust stability.   
 3 
The time is split in period T (please see Fig. 2). In 
each period, let TON be the time that the network is 
allocated for the control system and TOFF= T- TON is the 
time that the network is used for other purpose. Under the 
assumption (3), we want to find the minimal TON to 
guarantee the robust stability of the NCS. We hope the 
value TTON /  is as small as possible since small 
TTON /  means small network usage. We consider the 
static scheduling case. Without loss of generality, suppose 
that the first TON time of each period is assigned to the 
NCS.

t=0                  t=T                 t=2T

 Under the above assumptions the dynamic behavior 
of the networked control system can be described by the 
following dynamic equation:

This is a switched control system. We will prove its 
stability by the Lyapunov stability theory. Under (3), it is 
known that ( ) 0)(Remax <+ FBA iijj λ . Let iη  satisfies

2.3、Model-based networked feedback robust 
control for polytopic systems

control systems design. The considered system is

iii tuBtxAtx α           (13) 
Suppose the open-loop system is unstable. First consider 
that the measured data is transmitted periodically, with 
period τ , to the controller. We construct an approximate 
mathematical model of the controlled plant in the 
controller side, as showing in Fig. 3: 
   )(ˆ)(ˆ)( tuBtAt += ξξ       (14)

Every times the measured data is transmitted via the 
network to the controller, the state of the approximate 
model (14) is updated. That is, )()( ττξ kxk = , 
k=1,2,…,m. For the time that the measured data does not 
been transmitted to the controller, the control signal is 
computing by using the state of the approximate model 
(that is, )()( tFtu ξ= ). Suppose the feedback matrix F is 
such that the following LMIs 
  0)()( <++++ QFBAPPFBA iiTii , i=1,2,…,p (15) 
has positive definite solution P  and Q. This implies that 
if the system and the controller is connected directly (not 
networked), then the closed-loop system is robust stable. 
Then, what is the maximal allowable transmission period 
τ ?

Inequality (18) gives us a rule to check whether a 
transmission period τ  is allowable. 
 Now, we consider the case that measured data is not 
transmitted periodically. It is transmitted only if necessary. 
We derive a formula for determining whether a measured 
data should be transmitted. For demonstration, let tj be the 
time of the j-th time transmission. The closed-loop system 
is:

III、CONCLUSIONS 
 In the second year of this project, we have derived 
an upper bound for the time slot in a specified period 
that the shared network should be allocated to a 
polytopic NCS to guarantee robust stability. Moreover, 
we have proposed a formula for verifying an upper bound 
for the transmission period for periodically transmitted 
networked feedback polytopic control systems. Furthermore, 
based on the transmission-if-necessary scheme, we have 
developed a formula to determine whether a measured data 
should be transmitted to the networked controller. Finally, 
for model-based networked feedback polytopic systems, we 
have presented several sufficient conditions for guaranteeing 
the robust stability. The next works in this year are to 
develop controller synthesis methods and find simulation 
examples for verifying the proposed results.

III. DESIGN OF WNNC SYSTEM 
The control problem of DC-DC power converter is 
to control the change of duty cycle dδ  so that the 
output voltage 
oV  can provide an output reference 
voltage. The output error voltage is defined as 
oref VVe −=  (5) 
where 
refV  is the output reference voltage. If the 
system parameters are well known, an ideal controller 
can be designed as [13]

A. Wavelet Neural Network 
A four-layer WNN shown in Fig. 2, which comprises 
an input layer (the i layer), a wavelet layer (the j layer), 
a product layer (the k layer), and an output layer (the o 
layer), is adopted to implement the neural controller. 
The signal propagation and the basic function in each 
layer are now introduced in the following paragraphs. 
Layer 1: Input Layer:

where ex =11  and )1(

time delay. 
Layer 2: Wavelet Layer: 
A family of wavelets is constructed by translations 
and dilations performed on the mother wavelet. In the 
mother wavelet layer each node performs a wavelet 
jφ  
that is derived from its mother wavelet. For the j-th node

( ) ( )2222 jjjjj netnetfy φ== , nj ,,2,1 …=  (10) 
where ijm  and ijσ  are, respectively, the translation 
and dilation in the j-th term of the i-th input 2ix  to the 
node of mother wavelet layer and n  is the total number 
of the wavelets with respect to the input nodes. In this 
paper, the Gaussian wavelet function 
( ) )exp(cos)( 2xxxj −= ωφ  is selected as a mother wavelet 
and one can take direct products of such scalar wavelets 
in the multi-dimensional case in which ω  is the 
frequency. 
Layer 3: Produce Layer: 
Each node k in the wavelet layer is denoted by ∏ , 
which multiplies the input signals and outputs the result 
of the product, i.e. the product of j mono-dimensional 
wavelets with respect to the input node. For the k-th rule

where 3jx  represents the j-th input to the node of 
wavelet layer and l  is the number of wavelets. 
Layer 4: Output Layer: 
The single node o in the output layer is labelled as 
Σ , which computes the overall output as the summation 
of all input signals

strength of the k-th output associated with the k-th 
wavelet, 4kx  represents the k-th input to the node of 
output layer, and 4oy  is the output of neural controller.

converter. 
 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The block diagram of the computer control system for 
the converter is shown in Fig. 4. A servo control card 
installed in the control computer includes multi-channels 
of D/A, A/D, PIO and encoder interface circuits. The 
control algorithm is realized in the Pentium using ‘‘Visual 
C’’ language. The amplitude of the dc-link voltage is 
controlled by the forward DC-DC power converter 
according to the output of the proposed WNNC system. 
The experimental case is addressed as follows: (1) output 
voltage variation case (the input voltage is set as 
VVi 20= ). In the output voltage variation case, the output 
reference voltages are changed (i) from V10  to V12  at 
300msec, (ii) from V12  to V8  at 600msec. The circuit 
parameter values of the forward DC-DC power converter 
are chosen as 3:4: 21 =NN , Ω= 20R , HL µ500=  and 
FC µ2200= . The converter runs at a switching frequency 
of HzK20  and the controller runs at a sampling 
frequency of HzK1 . A PWM IC SG1825 is used to 
generate the duty cycle and the generated duty cycle is 
directly proportional to the analog output of the controller. 
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design 
method, a comparison between a PI controller and the 
proposed WNNC is made. 
 
 
Fig. 4. Experimental setup of computer controlled DC-DC 
power converter. 
 
First, the PI control scheme proposed in [1] is 
applied to the forward DC-DC power converter to 
compare the regulation efficiency. The PI controller 
output is computed as 
ekeku dp +=  (41) 
where 
pk  and dk  are designed by the users. In (41), it 
is a PD control for dδ  and it can be regarded as a PI 
control for d . The experimental results of the PI control 
with 0005.0=pk  and 02.0=dk  for the output voltage 
variation case and load resistance variation case are 
shown in Fig. 5. The converter responses are shown in 
Figs. 5(a) and 5(c); and the associated control efforts are 
shown in Figs. 5(b) and 5(d), respectively. To speed up 
the convergence of the tracking error, the experimental 
results of the PI controller with 01.0=pk  and 2.0=dk  
for these two cases are shown in Fig. 6. From the 
experimental results in Figs. 5 and 6, it can be observed 
that when the control parameters are chosen for achieving 
fast response, the overshoot is relatively large. From this
