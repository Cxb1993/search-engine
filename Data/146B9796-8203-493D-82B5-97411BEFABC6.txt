二、緣由與目的
Open queueing network models provide a powerful and rich framework in many
fields, such as computer and communication networks, production and manufacturing
systems, service centers, traffic control, facility planning, and capacity planning
(Balsamo et al. 2003, Gross and Harris 1998). Many studies have been published on this
topic; recent studies include Yang et al. (2005), Rhee (2005), Azaron et al. (2005),
Sennott et al. (2005), Van Nyen et al. (2004), Sherman and Kharoufeh (2004), Haskose
et al. (2002), and so on. Most of these studies based on the classical queueing theory
assume that the interarrival times and service times are required to follow certain
probability distributions (Gross and Harris 1998). However, probability distributions
require either a prior calculable regularity or a posterior frequency determination to
construct. In real world situations, the information of the arrival pattern and service
pattern could be very little, and may be sometimes obtained from experts subjectively;
for example, they are sometimes described by linguistic terms such as fast, moderate, or
slow, rather than by probability distributions. Fuzzy set theory has been demonstrated to
be an appropriate means for modeling uncertainty arising from mental phenomena
(Zimmermann 2001). Therefore, queueing networks with fuzzy parameters are much
more realistic than the crisp queueing networks. If the performance analysis of queueing
networks can be extended to fuzzy environments, queueing network models would have
wider applications.
On a few articles address fuzzy queueing problems (for example, Prade 1980, Li and
Lee 1989, Buckley 1990, Negi and Lee 1992, Kao et al. 1999, Buckley et al. 2001), in
that few articles have been published on fuzzy queueing networks with fuzzy
parameters. For example, Zhang and Phillis (2000) applied fuzzy logic to the optimal
control problem of tandem two-station queueing network with two types of customers.
Jo et al. (1993) investigated the delay analysis and performance of a queueing network
model based on fuzzy set theory. They also applied fuzzy set theory to the open central
server network model and the closed single class Baskett-Chandy-Muntz-Palacios
(BCMP) network model for computer systems (Jo et al. 1996). Jo et al. (1997) extended
the results of previous studies to the multiclass BCMP model. However, the obtained
performance measure in most of these studies is shown as a triangular fuzzy number
which denoting the minimum value, a modal value and a maximum value of the
performance measure, yet the sense of fuzziness is not conserved completely. On the
basis of Zadeh’s extension principle (Zadeh 1978, Yager 1986, Zimmermann 2001), the
performance measure is often not necessarily a triangular fuzzy number, even if the all
of the input parameters are triangular fuzzy numbers. If we can derive the membership
function of some performance measure that maintains the fuzziness of input information
completely, we obtain a more reasonable and realistic performance measure that can be
used to represent the fuzzy queueing network more accurately.
In this project, we shall apply the extension principle to evaluate the performance
measure for a queueing network model with arrival rates and service rates being fuzzy
numbers. The obtained membership functions of performance measures conserve all the
fuzziness of input parameters completely. A pair of parametric nonlinear programs is
formulated to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the -cut of the performance
measure. Consequently, the membership function of the performance measure is derived
analytically or numerically by enumerating different values of .
Fuzzy open queueing networks
Consider a k-station queueing network system in which customers (jobs) arrive from
outside this system to station i , 1,2,...,i k , in accordance with independent Poisson

The membership functions in (5a) and (5b) are theoretically correct, but they are not in
the usual forms for practical use and they are very difficult to imagine their shapes.
Since the application of Zadeh’s extension principle to ( , )p R W could be viewed as
the application of this principle to the -cuts of ( , )p R W (Nguyen 1978), one
approach to construct the membership function ( , )p R W is to derive the -cuts of
( , )p R W . The -cuts of jr and , 1, 2,..., ,j j k  are defined as (Zimmermann
2001)
( ) { | ( ) }, ,

( ) { | ( ) },

y y j      Y  . (6b)
Note that ( )jr  and ( ), 1, 2,..., ,j j k   are crisp sets rather than fuzzy sets. By the
concept of -cut, the imbedded fuzzy Markov chain in the fuzzy queueing network can
be decomposed into a family of crisp Markov chains with different transition probability
matrices, which are also parameterized by . The arrival rates and service rates can be
represented by different levels of confidence intervals (Negi and Lee 1992).
6U( ) ,jy j  , vary over the interval [0, 1] , they fall into the category of parametric
programming (Taha 2003). For solving Models (8a) and (8b) that is a pair of nonlinear
programs with linear constraints and bound constraints, several methods can be adopted,
in that two of effective and efficient solution methods, namely sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) method and generalized reduce gradient (GRG) method are more
effective and efficient (Bazaraa et al. 1993). Moreover, many commercial computer
solvers, such as LINGO (LINDO Systems Inc. 1999), can be employed to solve them.
Clearly, the -cut of Lis the crisp interval L U[ , ]L L  solved from (8a) and (8b).
As stated previously, all -cuts form a nested structure with respect to . For two
cuts 1 and 2 such that 2 10 1    , the feasible regions defined by 1 in
Models (8a) and (8b) are smaller than those defined by 2 . Consequently, we have
1 1 2 2
L U L U[ , ] [ , ]L L L L    ; that is, LL is nondecreasing with respect to  and UL is
nonincreasing with respect to . This property assures that Lis a fuzzy number that
possesses convexity. Therefore, from the solutions of (8a) and (8b), the membership
function Lcan be constructed.
If both LL and
UL are invertible with respect to , then a left shape function
L 1( ) ( )L z L
 and a right shape function U 1( ) ( )R z L  can be obtained by taking the
inverse of LL and
UL, from which the membership function L is constructed as
follows:

Otherwise, by enumerating different  values, the set of intervals L U{[ , ] |L L 
[0, 1]} approximates the shape of L, although its exact function is not known
explicitly.
Clearly, the membership functions of other performance measures, such as the
expected sojourn time W~ , the expected queue waiting time qW, and the expected
queue length
qL
~ , can be derived in the same manner.
Note that the expected number of customers in the system constructed via the
proposed approach is expressed by a membership function rather than by a crisp value;
that is, it is a fuzzy performance measure. The benefit and significance of such a fuzzy
performance measure are that it maintains the fuzziness of input data, thus it can
represent the imprecise queueing network systems more accurately. This indicates that
the proposed approach can obtain more realistic performance measures when some
input data of queueing network systems are fuzzy.
2. Numerical examples
To illustrate how the proposed approach is applied to analyze fuzzy queueing network
systems, in this section we investigate two numerical examples. The first one, inspired
by Ross (2003), is a two-station queueing network that is relatively simple, thus a
close-form membership function can be derived by taking the inverse of its -cuts.
The second example consisting five stations is complicated, thus a close-form
membership function could not be possible to derive. By enumerating different 
values, the lower and upper bounds of the -cuts of the performance measure are
calculated to approximate the membership function. Therefore, to gain some insight into

On the basis of Models (8a) and (8b), the lower and upper bounds of the -cuts of L
can be derived by solving a pair of parametric nonlinear programs. Consequently, we

It is a challenging task to derive the inverse functions of (12a), (12b), (13a), and (13b)
since they are complicated, thus the closed-form membership functions for L and
W are hardly obtainable. Table 2 shows the -cuts of L and W of the
five-station queueing network system at 11 distinct -values: =0, 0.1, 0.2,…, 1.0. At
each of these possibility levels, the lower and upper bounds of the -cuts of L and
W could be obtained from its corresponding pair of parametric programs solved by
using the nonlinear programming solver LINGO (LINDO Systems Inc. 1999). These
values are exactly the same as those obtained via substituting these 11 distinct
-values into (12a), (12b), (13a), and (13b), indicating that these four derived equations
are correct. Figures 3 and 4 depict the shapes of L and W by enumerating fifty-one
values of : 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06,…, 1.00, respectively. The approximated shapes turn
out rather fine, just like continuous functions.

rate is fuzzy. The -cut of a certain performance measure represents the possibility that
it will appear in the associated range. Specifically, the =0 cut shows the range that it
could appear and the =1 cut shows its most possible value. In Example 1, referring to
(12), the support of Lis rather wide, ranging from 4548/3599 (or approximately
1.2637) to 111/4 (or 27.7500); this range indicates, although the expected number of
customers in the system is fuzzy, it is impossible for its value to fall below 1.2637 or
exceed 27.7500. The value of the expected number of customers in the system most
likely falls between 7/3 (or approximately 2.3333) and 2896/575 (or approximately
5.0365).
In Example 2, at one extreme end for the possibility level =1, the range of the
expected number of customers in the system is [6.0544, 12.9689] (referring to the
second and third columns of Table 2), indicating that it is definitely possible that the
expected the expected number of customers in the system falls between 6.0544 and
12.9689; and referring to the fourth and fifth columns of Table 2, the most possible
value of the expected sojourn time falls between [0.3187, 0.5404] (in minutes). At
another extreme end for the possibility level =0, the ranges of the expected the
expected number of customers in the system and the expected sojourn time are [3.1481,
63.4041] and [0.2249, 2.1863], respectively (referring to the first row of Table 2). These
two ranges indicate that the expected the expected number of customers in the system
will never exceed 63.4041 or fall below 3.1481, and the value of the expected sojourn
time is impossible to fall outside the range of 0.2249 and 2.1863. The above information
that conserves completely fuzziness of input data will be very useful for designing
queueing network systems.
Another thing worthwhile noting is the shape of the derived membership functions.
Note that both the arrival rate from outside of the system and the service rate are
assumed to be trapezoidal. However, referring to Figures 2-4, since they are transformed
via (5a) and (5b) based on Zadeh’s extension principle, the membership functions of
performance measures are not trapezoidal any more. Instead, they skew to the right and
have two nonlinear sides. This is different from the results reported in previous studies
(Jo et al. 1996), in that the membership functions have linear sides.
4. Conclusion
Open queueing network models have been widely applied to performance evaluations
in many practical systems. This paper uses a parametric programming approach to
derive performance measures of queueing networks with fuzzy parameters. The
parametric program has a nonlinear objective function with constraints formulated from
classical queueing theory and Zadeh’s extension principle. For simple problems, such as
Example 1 in the preceding section, the analytic solution of the membership function of
the performance measure can be derived by taking the inverse of its -cuts. For
relatively complicated problems, such as Example 2, numerical solutions for different
 values are calculated to approximate the membership function. Clearly, the proposed
approach is not confined to the performance measures stated in this paper. Other
performance measures, such as the waiting time distribution and the busy period, are
also applicable.
In real world, many phenomena are fuzzy in nature. If the obtained performance
measure is a crisp value, or it cannot conserve all of the fuzziness from input
information, then it may lose some useful information that could make the
decision-maker overconfident. With the approach proposed in this paper, more realistic
performance measures could be obtained, which provides the decision-maker with more
information to make better decisions.
