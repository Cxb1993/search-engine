i-Trust: Exploring Collective Wisdom for Ubiquitous Trust e-
Service 
Astract. Ubiquitous e-service is one of the most recent links in the chain of evolution that 
has characterized the different eras of the internetworking environment. In order to leap the 
trust barrier for the user to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, we present a collaborative 
iTrust e-service for exploring collective wisdom in the ad-hoc ubiquitous environment. 
Simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show significant improvement 
over traditional designs. The iTrust e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with 
the nearby user groups for establishing a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. 
It also facilitates and empowers the potential benefits of various ubiquitous e-service 
applications. 
1.   Challenges for Ubiquitous e-Service 
The ongoing, rapid developments in information systems technologies and networking have 
generated significant opportunities for streamlining decision-making processes and maximizing 
productivity through distributed collaborations that facilitate unprecedented levels of sharing of 
information and computational resources. We have witnessed the necessity of collaboration and 
resource sharing in many massively distributed computing systems such as the P2P file sharing 
for fast information dissemination, cooperative caching for Web content delivery, enterprise 
collaboration in E-commerce, and so on. Emerging collaborative environments need to provide 
efficient support for seamless integration of heterogeneous technologies such as mobile devices 
and infrastructures, web services, grid computing systems, various operating environments, and 
diverse products. Such heterogeneity introduces, however, significant security and privacy 
challenges for distributed collaborative applications. In such a loosely-coupled open computing 
system, trust management has become essential, together with traditional cryptography 
techniques, for building a healthy collaboration among participating peers (or agents). Hence, 
ensuring trust in an ubiquitous environment is one of the most important tasks of the new 
networking paradigm. Recent work [10] suggests that reputation based trust systems as an 
effective way for nodes to identify and avoid malicious nodes in order to minimize the threat 
and protect the system from possible misuses and abuses by malicious nodes in a decentralized 
overlay networks. Such systems typically assign each node a trust value based on the 
transactions it has performed with others and the feedbacks it has received. 
However, the ubiquitous environment is different from a traditional static environment. It 
presents significant challenges for users in determining which users are trustworthy. The notion 
of ambient e-services is proposed to identify a new scope of ubiquitous e-service, which 
addresses dynamic collective efforts between mobile users (enabled by Mobile-P2P technology), 
dynamic interactions with ambient environments (envisioned by Location-Based Services), 
moment of value, and low cost service provision [3]. Since the ubiquitous identities are not 
designed for long-term lived and historical information is also seldom available in the ad-hoc e-
[2], social trust is not blind, but derives from personal or interpersonal experience, and those 
experiences are gathered from the informal groups that constitute our daily life. Users may 
retrieve various experiences as the decision resource, but how are those experiences obtained 
from the ubiquitous e-service environment? 
2.1   Experience co-creation approach 
Experience co-creation occurs when users perceive powerful events from interaction 
experiences with other users. Reputation estimation is performed by aggregating these 
perceived experiences. For most commercial scenarios, reputation data is defined as 
transaction-based experiences. That is, when a transaction process is executed, reputation data 
will be established and recorded. Whether the transaction process is completed or abandoned, a 
reputation record from the transaction will still be generated (abandoned transactions usually 
have a negative effect on reputation). If reputation data is accessible, others may also take 
reputation data into their decision considerations. Experience co-creation in the iTrust e-service 
highlights the co-creation process and the shared experience of collective effort, which provides 
meaningful information for collaborative interactions. 
In an unknown environment, users may not be familiar with the other people around them. 
They may not understand who is reliable or trustworthy. There is seldom information available 
for trust decision in an ad-hoc ubiquitous environment. The iTrust e-service extends the 
information sources from traditional commerce scenarios that consider the transaction-based 
experience only. Instead, interaction-based experiences are also considered as another 
heterogeneous data source. 
Researchers have defined trust as an expectation. The expectations and determinations for 
trust are all related to the concepts of competence, benevolence and responsibility. Those are 
the major factors for satisfying the “Cognitive-based trust” and the “Affective-based trust” in 
interpersonal trust [8]. When applying emotional measurement factors to judge provided 
services, interaction-based experiences are desirable information sources for trust estimation -- 
the judgment of whether the service provider has the ability to give the needed service. Does the 
buyer can comprehend whether the service provider really cares for their needs in providing the 
service? More importantly, do the provided services actually fulfill the buyer’s urgent needs for 
all requirements? The following table (Table 1) indicates how those emotional factors are used 
for trust measurement in related research. The interaction-based trust is unfolded into those 
three the concepts as an alternative information sources. In addition to personal experience, 
available information sources also include the interpersonal experiences from one’s social 
network. Heterogeneous interaction-based trust estimations are collected from the proximal user 
groups which represent experience co-creation process for contributing the collaborative trust 
decisions.

The final score for trust candidate selection represents the aggregate results from obtained

A risk parameter β is also set up by the user in the User Profile as the trustworthiness threshold. 
Once the TrustFinalScore is lower thanβ, the corresponding interaction pseudonym is removed 
from the transaction candidate list. The best candidate will be the first priority for further 
service exchanges. 
3.   iTrust e-Service Design 
We have identified the major challenges in an ubiquitous environment and the urgent needs for 
collaborative iTrust e-service. We use an iTrust platform that considers privacy design, 
reputation management, and trust management as the central concepts for establishing an 
autonomous trust model for exploring the collective effort in the ubiquitous environment. 
Different from traditional architecture, the iTrust e-service highlights distributed peer-to-peer 
interaction under ad-hoc network composition, and accommodates the dynamic short-lived 
identity characteristics and the limited computational capacities of mobile device. Also, the 
iTrust e-service provides seamless unlinkability to ensure user protection and adopts 
heterogeneous data sources to enhance quality for trust collaboration. Classical method designs 
may be used for partial solutions to the problem, but require heavy computations that are 
difficult to carry out in a mobile device. But most previous designs cannot be applied to our 
problem as their architecture is not suited to an ad-hoc ubiquitous environment and their design 
concepts do not address the challenges of the ubiquitous environment.  
3.1   iTrust Privacy and Security Design 
The privacy protection design of iTrust is illustrated in Hwang and Yuan 2006 [4]. The iTrust 
privacy design concept is based on multiple layered pseudonyms to ensure identity security and 
unlinkability. The iTrust privacy design excludes a unique personal pseudonym for interactions 
to protect users from possible tracking and profiling. It uses multiple interaction pseudonyms to 
enhance the complexity of identity tracing by abstracting the design of role/relationship 
pseudonyms for service version selection and delivery. (i.e. versioning the services by specific 
types for performance consideration.)  For transaction security, iTrust design uses a transaction 
pseudonym to ensure safety for a one time payment. 
 
Fig. 2. Macro view of the Collaborative iTrust platform 
• Profile Management 
In the iTrust e-service platform, mobile users can manage their profile settings through a 
friendly user interface. The profiles includes their preferences and the roles they would like to 
play, and various attributes such as user's willingness to participate, the will to disclose their 
interaction experiences, the risk level they can tolerate, and the reliability threshold for 
determining whether to interact with nearby peers. Once an identity has been generated, those 
settings will be assigned to the interaction pseudonym automatically. 
• Anonymizer 
In the iTrust e-service platform, all interactions within the ubiquitous e-service environment 
are using the “Interaction Pseudonyms” instead of user’s real identity or personal pseudonyms. 
The main function for the Anonymizer is to generate diverse occasional interaction pseudonyms 
based on their given identity for various kinds of e-services. Those interaction pseudonyms are 
valid for a short period, and are localized to the corresponding e-service acquired. Because the 
randomized interaction pseudonyms are not linked to real personal identities and are valid for a 
limited range, others will be unable to trace their real owner via the interaction pseudonyms. 
Those interaction pseudonyms are generated by the Anonymizer and will inherit the attribute 
parameters automatically through the Profile management module. They are able to execute the 
versioning process and cope with the service management module to reduce irrelevance 
transmission and improve the efficiency of interaction.  
• Interaction Pseudonym Renew 
As mentioned in previous sections, iTrust e-service has overcome the problem of the 
dynamic composition of surrounding peers that may change rapidly. The Interaction 
Pseudonym Renew module is used to update the list of current nearby users, which exhibits all 
available nearby peer interaction pseudonyms. Users can interact with peers around themselves 
through the Communication module. The Interaction Pseudonym Renew module is connected 
Once the users have accomplished the transaction, a reputation evaluation token is 
exchanged. According to the feedback result recorded in the reputation evaluation token, the 
summarized global reputation data is updated automatically. The reputation evaluation tokens 
are blind-signed and enable unlinkability for keeping the reputation data from revealing the 
referee’s true identity. This Reputation Management module not only acts as the information 
source for credibility investigation, but is also linked to the Interaction Pseudonym renew 
module for global reputation updates. 
• Interaction Trust Management 
In contrast to the reputation management module that records the transaction histories, the 
interaction trust management module places emphasis on a user’s direct interaction experience. 
It highlights the perceived value from the interaction’s target peer and treats the interaction-
based experience as another vital information source. In cooperation with the Credibility 
Investigation module, it provides heterogeneous information based on user experiences stored 
in the social network for trust estimation of unfamiliar users. 
• Communication Module 
The ZigBee based communication module makes use of the security services that are already 
present in the 802.15.4 security specification. ZigBee infrastructure security includes network 
access control, integrity of packet routing, and prevention of unauthorized use of packet 
transport. ZigBee application data security includes message integrity, authentication, freshness, 
and privacy [9]. 
4.   Effect of Collective Wisdom 
In this simulation scenario, the goal is to verify whether the collective wisdom gathered from 
ubiquitous environment could improve the decision quality for estimating the trustworthiness of 
unfamiliar user. Two different reputation mechanisms are available for trust estimation: the 
traditional reputation mechanism allows users to estimate from the global reputation data and 
his/her owned personal transaction experience; the iTrust e-service equipped with credibility 
investigation module that can explore the collective wisdom of the ubiquitous environment as 
well as the global reputation data, and the user’s personal experience.  
In the ubiquitous environment, user’s perishability and their anxiety level may strongly affect 
their interaction behaviors. User behaviors can be distinguished from the two dimensions and 
sorted into 4 stereotypes. Perishability represents the level of urgency the user brings to 
completion of the task, the desire to obtain the service as soon as possible. With higher 
perishability, users prefer to consume their resources (eq. time and processing capability, etc.) 
in service discovery rather than comparing which user is more reliable. Instead, once the service 
provision is acceptable and the provider’s reliability fulfills their basic trustworthiness threshold, 
a transaction begins. The anxiety level represents the user’s mental perception of security 
protection and how they view the probability of privacy intrusions and security breaches. Users 
with lower anxiety levels may consider various received service information as an alternative 
choice even though the provided services may not be related to their request. By contras, users 
with a high anxiety level are serious about whether the provider cares about their needs. Since 
accepting messages consumes a user’s limited resources, spam messages or irrelevant service 
messages will be considered inimical actions. 
5. Significance & Contribution 
Considering the natural limitations of ad-hoc ubiquitous e-service environment, our iTrust 
design has several significant improvements and contributions. The collaborative iTrust 
platform accordingly is empowered to realize the vision of ubiquitous iTrust e-service in terms 
of the following perspectives: 
• Deliberation of short-term lived pseudonyms: Revises existing long term identity design 
concepts and ensures the unlinkability of identities. 
• Distributed data process consideration: Each interaction record within the iTrust e-service 
environment relies on the computational loading and data storage in the mobile device 
instead of the centralized server database. 
• Lightweight consideration: Different from the existing works of centralized gradational 
pseudonym design (the quantity of interaction data will be expanded in exponential growth), 
our design method integrates a user’s conceptual role information and relationship 
information into an abstract public information attached to the user’s identity. This attached 
abstract information can then provide hints to filter out inadequate service information that 
will reduce unnecessary data transmission. Since the required feature of lightweight 
computation for mobile devices is emphasized, our design reduces considerable expansion 
and makes it adequate to the ubiquitous e-service. Moreover, the adoption of the time stamp 
design is exerted to omit those overdue historical interaction data, which will further improve 
the strength of interaction pseudonym’s unlinkability. 
• Convenience requirement: Under the versioning scheme, irrelevant service information is 
filtered out. Only highly correlated services are delivered to the requester. The versioning 
design reduces communication costs and system loading while improving service efficiency. 
6.   Conclusions 
Trust has been considered as a top criterion for the acceptance of e-service adoption. This 
paper proposes a ubiquitous iTrust platform that exerts the identity design to deliver the visions 
of collaborative trust e-service with an integrated consideration of trust, reputation and privacy 
requirements. It is proposed to provide a feasible solution for quality decisions in the dynamic 
and distributed environment. iTrust e-Service highlights the collective effort focused on 
collecting the user group’s power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions. We have 
implemented the iTrust e-Service platform, and our on-going works include the evaluation of 
the design and the platform from different perspectives (trust, reputation, privacy, efficiency, 
usability, etc.). Preliminary evaluations results indicate the iTrust design can eliminate potential 
risk and provide appropriate estimation for trust decision in the ad-hoc ubiquitous environment.

ABSTRACT 
Understanding customer expectations is an important and essential issue in the field 
of service science. For instance, what factors would particularly affect the desired service 
level and the adequate service level of customer expectations? How can producers fulfill 
the variable needs for customer satisfaction? Hence, this study based on the domain 
knowledge of expectations is to propose a framework which aids in producing the service 
tactics for service providers. Our research aims to fit in different industries and leads the 
variety of providers to a better course of customer expectation management. This study 
themselves in the process of service production and delivery (i.e., service encounters). 
Customer participation in service encounters makes service tactics that are variously 
formed so that producers can develop particular a service episode (aiming at an individual 
customer) when delivering the service. Herewith, we define service tactics as the 
combination of customer efforts and producer efforts (i.e., continuity of co-production). 
Through manipulating the expectations (by engineering the factors which influence the 
expectations), businesses can then gain the capability of providing services swinging with 
customer expectations accordingly (or vice versa) and then reach an all-win situation 
(what is so called eco-efficiency). Generally, our research aims to fit in different 
industries and leads the variety of providers to a better course of developing the service 
episodes. Nevertheless, in the paper we will focus on service episode scenarios for 
product-based service industries. These scenarios will be demonstrated by applying the 
framework we propos. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follow. Section 2 introduces the theoretical 
background on customer expectation. Section 3 presents our analysis framework. The last 
section concludes the research and gives directions for future studies. 
 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Service Encounter Satisfaction Model 
James L. Walker (1995) proposed that the conceptualized service encounter 
satisfaction model which is divided into three separate stages of disconfirmation. This 
model considers “how zone of tolerance” and core and peripheral service performance 
influence customer satisfaction. 
 In the first stage evaluation, the customer encounters the peripheral service, before 
he/she consumes the core service. The appearance of a physical evidence of services 
plays a critical role on the consumers’ willingness. Peripheral service performance is a 
vital part of the total service offering. In the second stage evaluation, the core service is 
more anticipated by the consumer. Levitt (1983) and Hill (1986) argued that service 
consumers expect the core aspect to be paramount and marketers must understand that 
precluding dissatisfaction (with the core service) is a prerequisite for satisfying customers. 
Czepiel et al. (1985) suggested that only small deficiencies in the core service 
performance can be overcome. The conceptualized service encounter satisfaction model 
separates the second stage from the first stage and third stage evaluation. In the third 
stage, it’s for the post-core-service delivery interaction; it’s also a peripheral component 
in the overall offering service.  
McGill and Iacobucci (1992) also demonstrated that pre-consumption and 
the single level of expectation standard, which meant customer felt a service provider 
should offer. However, recent researchers kept evolving and extending the conceptual 
model of expectations, putting a lot of effort to pinpoint the critical element within 
customer expectations. These researchers offered multi-levels of customer expectations 
(Parasuraman et al., 1991; Zeithaml et al., 1993; Walker & Baker, 2000). According to 
their propositions, multiple standards would be more likely to completely understand the 
customer expectations of service. 
Parasuraman et al. (1991) proposed that customer service expectations comprise two 
levels: desired and adequate. Desired expectations represented the level of service a 
customer hopes to receive, defined as the level at which the customer wanted the service 
to perform. It was a combination of what the customer believed “can be” and “should 
be,” while adequate expectations, a lower level of expectation, considered to be 
customer’s acceptable level of performance. It was relied on the customer’s assessment of 
what the service “will be” (Zeithaml et al., 1993). The latter was the basic expectation 
level for customers to determine the service performance, whereas the former expectation 
level, which was higher than adequate expectation, could attract the customers, i.e., 
customers might be surprised and overwhelmed while the service providers were 
reaching or exceeding customer expectations. These actions directly made the customers 
tend to think the performance better and be satisfied with the service. In addition, in each 
service delivery process, customer service expectations were dual-level and dynamic. The 
level of desired and adequate expectation could vary from customers to customers and, 
potentially, from one situation to the next for the same customer (Zeithaml et al., 1993). 
Those situations differed from various industry sectors might even cause different 
expectation levels, enlarging the complexity of customer expectation. 
Antecedents of Zone of Tolerance 
Zeithaml et al. (1993) noted that the zone of tolerance of a customer would be 
influenced by several complex and multiple factors within service encounters. In other 
words, the desired and adequate service levels could change spontaneously because 
customers have physical and mental vibrations about services. Accordingly, the zone of 
tolerance would become wide or narrow naturally.  
Zeithaml et al. (1993) proposed a comprehensive framework of service expectations 
and clarified customer expectations by eleven antecedent factors which could affect the 
desired service level and the adequate service level (as depicted in Figure 2). Zeithaml et 
al. (1993) addressed that desired service expectations are determined by enduring service 
intensifiers and personal needs. Enduring service intensifiers are stable and individual 
factors that lead customers with a high sensitivity to be served. One factor of enduring 
price and tangibles. For example, a customer wants to buy an insurance form several 
firms which have different charges. The customer may consider that firms with high 
prices must provide them perfect service in high quality. Word-of-mouth communication 
is another important factor which influences desired service level of customers’ 
expectations and predicted service. In addition, word-of-mouth is personal and 
non-personal statements which proffer customers what the service encounter will be. At 
last, the internal factor is past experience which refers to customers’ previous exposure to 
service encounters. For example, when a customer wants to buy insurance from insurance 
firms, he would cogitate and consider about the experiences of insurance services in the 
past to make a correct decision.

arose from broadening the system to be optimized.  
PSS was winning for the producers/providers, the users and the environment, and 
thus could be said as win-win solutions. 
Three main business approaches to PSS could be seen as promising in terms of their 
win-win potential (systemic eco-efficiency) as below: 
z Services providing added value to the product life cycle. That means a company 
provided additional services to guarantee functionality and durability of the product.  
z Services providing “final results” for customers. It was the producer maintains the 
ownership of the products and was paid by the client just for providing the agree 
results.  
z Services providing “enabling platforms” for customers. It means a company offers 
access to enable clients to get the results they want. 
 
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
In this section we will illustrate our conceptual framework (as depicted in Figure 3) 
and show how the service providers can employ the framework to further the formulation 
of their service tactics.  
As we mentioned earlier, the customers play an active participative role in the 
service production and delivery process. Based on the service encounter triad (James and 
Mona, 2006), there are interactions between the three parties - service organization 
(service provider), contact personnel and customer – in the service encounter. This 
framework is then described in terms of the three phases:  
z Phase 1: Firstly, a service provider has to classify their objectives into a strategy type. 
According to different strategy types, such like selling new product or recovery 
services, each type is associated with a kind of state of expectation. This sate of 
expectation would capture a promise that while customers are under this kind of 
expectation (through the organization’s expectation-factor manipulation), the 
manipulator could not only achieve the objectives but have customer satisfied. For 
example, when a secondary service provider promotes a new product, their 
customers’ expectations may be too low, such as the lower adequate service level of 
customers, to expect a perfect and multi-functional product or service. However, if 
customers suffer a failure service in service encounters, their expectations should 
become high for the better recovery service from the service provider. In summary, 
service providers have to apply different strategy types to achieve customers’ 
expectations based on different service conditions. 
the product/service quality of the bicycle, the perceived risk of the bicycle might be in a 
high level. Nevertheless, the low perceived risk sometimes might also reduce the 
customer’s expectations. Hence, according to the above statement, the initial desired 
service level and adequate service level of customer expectation could be low. Our goal is 
manipulate customers’ expectations, such as raising the desired service level and adequate 
service level, in order to raise their expectations to purchase the bicycle. 
Based on the framework we mentioned earlier, the company could have the 
following operational strategies in order to reach the goal: 
z Explicit service promises 
The company can post advertisement on the popular portal websites, such like yahoo or 
Google, which have good selling skills in interacting with customer to raise the desired 
service level and adequate service level. 
z Word-of-mouth 
The company can build their customer relationship management system to continue to 
interact with their customers and build the good reputation of the company for their 
original customers. The desired service level and adequate service level would then be 
raised accordingly. 
z Past experience 
The company can set up an experience room to provide their customers with pre-purchase 
service experience. Hence, company could implement the virtual reality on the 
experience room to simulate within the real situation and providers can customize what 
customers want in real situations. The desired service level and adequate service level can 
then be raised. 
z Perceived service alternatives 
New bicycles can be augmented with different functions suggested by customers in order 
for the company to provide customization solutions for customers. Naturally the adequate 
service level will be raised. 
z Self-perceived service role 
Customers could know how to ride the bicycle suitably and how to perform their roles in 
the experience. If they perform well in the experience room, the adequate service level 
will be raised. 
In conclusion, the company can manipulate customers’ expectations through some 
strategies which utilize the influencing factors according to our framework. Zeithaml et al. 
(1993) noted that the desired service level is less subject to change than the adequate 
service level, and then the zone of tolerance will be narrower. 
 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we first give an overview about the service encounter and customer 
expectations research. After a critical analysis of the nature and determinants of customer 
expectations model, we propos a conceptual framework to describe what and how 
providers could manipulate their customers’ expectations by two interesting and logical 
scenarios about the product-based services. Based on these antecedents, which Zeithaml 
et al. developed, we comprehend what factors would particularly affect the desired 
service level and the adequate service level of customer expectations.  
However, there are several limitations associated with this paper. First, in order to 
achieve the satisfaction of customers, service providers should augment or narrow the 
zone of tolerance substantially depending on different service strategies. Although our 
research framework is extremely digestible and serviceable, how to categorize service 
providers’ strategy types based on the domination of customer expectations is an 
uncertain problem up to now. For example, what marketing or selling strategies service 
providers need to increase or decrease customers’ expectations is an important issue, 
nevertheless, literatures are insufficient for us to bind. Second, our research just pays 
attention to antecedent factors of the zone of tolerance rather than other influences. 
According to Zeithaml et al (1993), our research mainly tries to find out what and how 
service providers control their customers’ expectations.  
In conclusion, this preliminary study provides some ponderable insights and 
recommendations of customer expectations. Researchers can adopt this framework 
briskly to build the decision support systems for making service strategies in the future. 
More research is needed at the zone of tolerance to determine what sizes of the zone 
should be in terms of different service stages. Furthermore, simulation studies which are 
adaptable for the complicated problem may be conducted on the basis of this framework.
