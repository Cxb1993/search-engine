1摘要
摩擦與表面微結構破壞交互作用於工件與模具接觸之介面，是影響金屬成形製程的關
鍵效應。對於摩擦效應，一般採用固定摩擦係數之模式或磨潤模式作為模擬依據。固定摩
擦係數模式之數學形式簡單，但未考慮接觸介面之工件表面鋒隨製程變化之事實，而磨潤
膜模式雖已有考慮表面鋒變化之文獻發表，但其數學形式較複雜，仍無法廣泛應用於一般
的金屬成形模擬分析中。因此，本計畫提出一個以接觸表面之微結構破壞使表面鋒發生改
變進而影響摩擦效應之概念，以延性破壞準則為基礎推導一個工件表面破壞模式，經實驗
方式決定相關係數，用以預估表面粗糙度之變化，並將其導入修改的崔斯卡摩擦模式，作
為金屬成形工件與模具接觸介面模擬之依據，發展一個隨金屬成形製程進行而變化的摩擦
模式，並將所提出之摩擦模式植入發展中之軸對稱有限元素分析程式，配合相關實驗工作
之執行，對所提構想進行驗證。
研究重點包括：(a)推導以破壞準則為基礎之摩擦模式，並植入自行研發之有限元素分
析程式中，建構一個金屬成形模擬系統; (b)進行相關之實驗工作，以建立金屬成形模擬與摩
擦模式所需的相關係數值。工作包括利用拉伸試驗獲得應力應變曲線、設計並執行破壞應
變能與表面粗糙度關係實驗、執行雙杯反向擠出實驗以驗證所提理論。
總之，本計畫以新的方法處理金屬成形介面摩擦之問題，並以實驗驗證所提模式之可

有利於微尺度成形之模擬分析。經由理論與實驗之研究，對於如何處理其他工程問題中之

Abstract
The study proposes a new method based on the ductile fracture of workpiece surface to
modify the Tresca friction model for the use in metal forming simulation. The method considers
the roughness change and the incomplete filling at the contact interface due to exist of surface
asperities. During metal forming process, the surface asperities are being altered and mostly
flatten because of fracture and wear. The surface roughness and friction conditions are thus being
changed. This change can be directly related to the fracture at the contact interface. By using the
proposed ductile fracture criterion, it is possible to predict the change of the surface roughness
and thus the friction conditions at the workpiece-die interface in metal forming process.
The developed friction model was implanted into an in-house simulation program for the
metal forming process. The experiments were carried out to determine the mechanical properties
and coefficients for the proposed friction model. The double cup extrusion tests were performed.
The simulated and experimental results has been analyzed to verify the proposed friction model
for metal forming simulation.
Keywords: metal forming, friction, fracture criterion, surface asperity
3literature reviews show the surface asperities of the workpiece are flattened, thus the contact ratio
increases and the surface roughness decreases at the workpiece-die interface during metal
forming process. The change of the asperities also affects lubrication regime.
The reviewed research works do not consider the interaction between the friction and the
wear at the workpiece-die interface during the metal forming process. However, the deformation
of surface asperity may cause the contact ratio increase and influence the lubrication. Moreover,
the roughness and asperity vary with the plastic deformation of the workpiece. The experimental
works conducted by Lee et al. [15], Kato [16] and Lovell and Deng [17] show that the friction is
affected by the roughness, the sliding speed and the contact length at the contact interface. The
parameters also are the main factors for inducing the wear [18].
Due to the fracture and induced wear on the workpiece surface, this study proposed a new
approach based on the change in roughness on the surface to construct a friction model for the
simulation of the metal forming process. The fracture of ductile metals may be predicted by a
criterion based on the strain energy of plastic deformation [19-24]. For example, the
Cockcroft-Latham damage criterion considers the unit tensile strain energy 1C in terms of the
maximum principle stress m

For porous materials, Oyane et al. used a material constant A and the effective stress  to

Clift et al. proposed a criterion 4C of the unit strain energy calculated by the effective stress and

In the above equations, and f are the effective strain and the effective at fracture, respectively.
The criteria, 1C ~ 5C , can be estimated from metal forming experiments, such as tensile tests or
simple upsetting tests. Gouveia et al. [19] found that two criteria proposed by both Cockroft and
Oyane respectively can be sued to accurately predict the fracture in simple upsetting tests.
Goijaerts et al. [22] applied different fracture criteria in the stamping processes of metal sheets.
The results showed that the criteria proposed both Oyane and Rice provide good correlations with
5The pressure and sliding effects cause the strain energy change and thus induce the fracture
in the surface asperities. The surface change is shown in Figure 1. The rough surface of the
workpiece in contact with the die can be treated as a porous layer. The thickness of the layer is
related to the average roughness of the surface aR . By considering the roughness of the
workpiece surface wR and the roughness of the die surface tR , the effective surface roughness
eR may be expressed as
2 2
e w tR R R  .
Due to the normal pressure n , the surface roughness will be change. The effective strain of the
porous layer e can be expressed by
f i
e e
e i
e
R R
R
  ,
where ieR and
f
eR are the effective roughness at initial surface and the deformed surface,
respectively. By increasing normal pressure n , the effective stress effective strain curves can be
established. The strain energy per unit volume C is expressed as
0
fC d
  ,
where stress  may be constructed in different forms. For example, it can be formulated in
terms of the fracture criterion proposed by Crockroft and Latham in which  is the maximum
principal stress. The total strain energy of the surface asperity tC is summation of the strain
energy from the normal pressure nC and the strain energy from sliding fracture sC .

 ,
where the effective strain of normal pressure n is measured from simple upsetting tests without
sliding and the effective strain of sliding t is obtained from the deformed surfaces. Moreover,
n can be controlled and  can be measured in the experiments. Therefore, it is possible to
obtain the relationships between tC and e, and the change in the surface roughness can be
estimated.
After the roughness of the workpiece surface has been estimated, it is possible to use the
Wilson’s model [7] to describe the tribological efects. In this study, the Tresca friction model, 
which is common used in the metal forming process, is studied for the dray condition. The model
is expressed as
k  ,
where is estimated shear stress, k is the shear strength andis the friction factor. By
considering the effective roughness of the workpiece surface eR , the Tresca model can be written
as
( , ) se k

   ,
where sv is the sliding speed at the contact interface, and  is a function of eR can be
determined by a data fitting technique. The proposed friction model not only takes the sliding
7At the contact interface s between the workpiece and the die, the stress and the external
traction T can be expressed as follows:
n T ,
where n is the vector of the normal direction of the contact surface. The relative velocity
sv between the workpiece and the die is calculated by
s dv v v  ,
where dv is the velocity of the die. On the contact interface c , the material point to slide on the
die surface can be written as
0sv n .
This constraint is imposed by the penalty method in this study.
The proposed friction model  was applied to the modeling of the large deformation of
metal forming with isothermal condition. With the penalty method for dealing with impressibility,
the energy of a metal forming system  can be expressed by the following equation

where V and S are the volume and the sliding contact interface, respectively.  is an

4. Finite Element Formulations
To deal with incompressible or near incompressible material flows in metal forming problems,
the mini-element including a bubble node shown in Figure 3 is one of choices because of its
reliability and cost effectiveness in numerical computation. The mini-element uses the
conventional three-node triangle and adds an additional node at the center of the triangle to divide
the triangle into three sub-triangles. The shape functions are in similar forms to those defined in
the three-node triangle, but plus a “bubble” function 4 .

6. Conclusions
The study proposes a new method based on the ductile fracture of workpiece surface to
modify the Tresca friction model for the use in metal forming simulation. The method considers
the roughness change and the incomplete filling at the contact interface due to exist of surface
asperities. During metal forming process, the surface asperities are being altered and mostly
flatten because of fracture and wear. The surface roughness and friction conditions are thus being
changed. This change can be directly related to the fracture at the contact interface. By using the
proposed ductile fracture criterion, it is possible to predict the change of the surface roughness
and thus the friction conditions at the workpiece-die interface in metal forming process.
The experiments of the double cup extrusion and the double groove extrusion show that the
billet surface roughness will close to the one of the die surface for both dry and lubricant
conditions. The Tresca friction factor is close to 0.2 at later stage of extrusion.
