sampler (LS). For YLS with fines content (FC) at
18%, the samples were frozen above ground before
transporting (Huang et al., 2008). Field seismic
CPT, PS logging as well as standard penetration
tests were performed at Yuan Lin test site. Mono-
tonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on un-
disturbed specimens trimmed from Laval samples.
Upon tests the natural soil samples were remixed to
make reconstituted specimens.
With the available database, the authors were able
to evaluate the correlations among cyclic resistance
ratio (CRR), Vs and cone tip resistance (qc) common-
ly used in the simplified procedure for liquefaction
potential assessment, for the tested silty sand. For
YLS and MLS, the undrained monotonic and cyclic
strength generally decreased with FC. Consistent
with the earlier findings, under the same density and
stress states, the undisturbed specimens showed sig-
nificantly more dilatant behavior than the reconsti-
tuted specimens. The tests on MLS and YLS also
showed results that contradict to earlier postulations
in the effects of fines on the correlations among
CRR, Vs, and qc (Huang et al., 2005). The contra-
dictions may be a result of the fact that natural silty
sand, especially alluvial silty sand has a layered
structure. The natural silty sand deposit can be
much more permeable than the uniformly mixed la-
boratory specimens due to the existence of closely
spaced, thin coarse sand layers. Judging from the
earlier experience, to properly ascertain the effects of
fines and soil layering, it is imperative that we per-
form field tests or laboratory tests on undisturbed
soil samples. The cost of Laval sampling, albeit
much reduced than freeze sampling, is still prohibi-
tively high. Field test procedures that include pie-
zo-cone penetration tests (CPTU) at much reduced
penetration rate were carried out to evaluate the pos-
sibility of detecting the existence of soil layering.
A practical sampling tool referred to as the gel-push
sampler was used to take high quality samples in sil-
ty sand.
The slow CPTU was first experimented in Yuan
Lin sand. A test site was established in Kao-
Hsiung in Southern Taiwan where slow CPTU and
gel-samples (GS) were taken. A series of triaxial
tests were performed on the GS specimens. The
paper provides a brief background on the earlier
findings from laboratory and field tests in MLS and
YLS. Details on the slow CPTU and gel-sampling
techniques as well as results from triaxial tests on
GS specimens are described.
2 GEOLOGICAL ORIGIN AND PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES OF MLS & YLS
The origin of both MLS and YLS was the central
mountain range that lied on the east side of Taiwan.
Weathered sedimentary and metamorphic rocks on
steep slopes were eroded by rainfall and transported
by rapidly flowing streams before deposition on the
west plain, to a thickness of several hundred meters.
The process of transportation ground the fractured
rock into sand and silt particles. Figure 1 shows
grain size distribution curves of MLS and YLS sam-
ples taken from the field. MLS and YLS both had
significant amounts of relatively soft muscovite and
chlorite, in addition to quartz. The muscovite con-
tents are much more significant in fines than the
coarse material. The minimum void ratios ( mine )
and maximum void ratios ( maxe ) with the fines con-
tents (FC) to be described in this paper, specific
gravity (Gs), liquid and plastic limits (L.L. and P.L.)
of particles passing No. 200 sieve of MLS and YLS
are summarized in Table 1. More details on the
geological background of MLS and YLS, their grain
characteristics and mineral contents can be found in
Huang et al. (2004) and Huang et al. (2008).

3 LESSONS LEARNED FROM TESTS IN MLS
AND YLS
3.1 Correlations among CRR, qc and Vs
A series of 94 CPT calibration tests were performed
in MLS. Four levels of fines contents, FC (0%,
15%, 30% and 50%), three initial relative densities,
Dro (50%, 70% and 85%), three levels of effective
vertical stress,’v (100, 200 and 300 kPa), and three
ly uniform. Figure 4 demonstrates a natural YLS
specimen of 89% FC that had a large pocket of
coarse sand mixed in a body of silt. For a specimen
of 43% FC, the multi-layered natural YLS specimen
was coupled with different colors. In making the
reconstituted specimens however, the soil is often
thoroughly mixed to assure uniformity and repeata-
ble test results. Some of the discrepancies in me-
chanical behavior between natural and reconstituted
silty sand specimens may have stemmed from the
existence of layering in natural soil deposit. To
properly interpret the CPT or CPTU results in silty
sand, it would thus be very helpful to verify first, the
existence of closely spaced free graining sand layers
in the field.

3.2 The slow CPTU in YLS
In lieu of the importance in detecting the drainage
conditions during cone penetration in a silty sand
deposit, a test procedure that involved the use of a
larger cone and slow penetration rate was experi-
mented at the Yuan Lin test site. The rate of pore
pressure drainage around a cone tip is inversely re-
lated to the square of the cone tip diameter. With
the same penetration rate, a larger cone would have a
less drained condition, or the penetration induced
excess pore pressure would be higher. CPT at a re-
duced penetration rate should induce lower excess
pore pressure. A series of CPTU using a standard
cone (cone cross sectional area=10cm2) penetrating
at 20mm/sec (the standard CPTU), a large cone
(cone cross sectional area=15cm2) penetrating at
20mm/sec (the large CPTU), and a standard cone
penetrating at 1mm/sec (the slow CPTU) were con-
ducted at the Yuan Lin test site. The pore pressure
element was located immediately behind the cone
face, at the u2 position. The results shown in Fig-
ure 5 indicated no significant differences in qc in
spite of the drastic differences in cone size and/or
penetration rate. Because of the time consuming
nature, slow CPTU was conducted only in depth le-
vels where Laval samples were taken where the FC
ranged from 18 to 89%. The u2 values from large
CPTU were mostly identical to those from the stan-
dard CPTU. The u2 in slow CPTU had almost a
perfect match with the hydrostatic pressure, uo, indi-
cating that 1mm/sec was slow enough to allow the
penetration induced pore pressure to fully dissipate
and reach a balance with the surrounding pore pres-
sure. Without the presence of close spaced drai-
nage layers, the above phenomenon would not have
been possible, judging from the level of fines content
at the Yuan Lin test site and the experience gained
from CPT in MLS.

4 FIELD TESTING AND SAMPLING AT KAO-
HSIUNG TEST SITE
The Kao Hsiung test site in Southern Taiwan was es-
tablished near the O1 rapid transit station. Silty
sand soil samples were taken with the gel-push
sampler, regular CPTU and slow CPTU were con-
Coarse sand pocket
on gel-push samples. All triaxial specimens were
consolidated to an effective vertical stress (’v)
comparable to the in situ overburden stress. The Vs
value of the specimen upon consolidation was meas-
ured in the triaxial cell with bender elements. Fig-
ure 10 compares the Vs measurements from bender
elements and those from the field seismic cone pene-
tration tests (SCPTU). For the most part, the labor-
atory Vs falls within or close to the range of those
from SCPTU at comparable depths.
Results of CKoU-AC triaxial tests on gel-push
specimens are shown in Figure 11. The specimens
were retrieved from depth range of 17.5-18.5m.
The specimens were consolidated to’v of 176 kPa.
The results showed more contractive behavior with
higher excess pore pressure development during
shearing as fines content increased from 14.46 to
24.43%. The characteristics of the triaxial test re-
sults are similar to those of undisturbed YLS speci-
mens taken with a Laval sampler as reported by
Huang et al. (2007).

6 CONCLUSIONS
Laboratory calibration tests have indicated that prop-
er interpretation of CPT in sand with fines should
consider the drainage conditions around the cone tip.
In the use of CPT for liquefaction potential assess-
ment under the framework of simplified procedure,
the CRR-qc1N correlation should be adjusted accord-
ing to drainage conditions rather than the fines con-
tent itself. The natural silty sand deposits in West-
ern and Southern Taiwan, often contain closely
spaced thin and permeable layers. Because of the
potential existence of permeable layers, the fines
content can be very misleading as an index to predict
the drainage conditions in the field. Slow CPTU
can be an effective tool to ascertain if the silty sand
is indeed mixed with closely spaced permeable lay-
ers in the field.
The gel-push sampler is more cost effective than
Laval sampler. Both samplers are capable of re-
trieving high quality samples in silty sand under am-
bient temperature. The effectiveness in characteri-
zation of silty sand should be much improved by
combining undisturbed sampling with slow CPTU.
