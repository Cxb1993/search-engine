cp Nn nx L I w , where 
×∈ℜ cpL NcpL  
contains the last cpL  rows of NI , is transmitted in 
serial through a discrete-time (assuming symbol rate 
sampling) FIR channel with order L and is 
contaminated by an additive channel noise ( )v n . At 
the receiver, the received samples ( )y n  are collected 
into blocks of length + cpN L . Assume that the length 
of CP is greater than or equal to the channel order, 
that is, ≥cpL L . By discarding the first cpL  samples 
in the received data block, the input-output channel 
characteristics, in terms of block signals, is described 
as (assuming that the receiver is synchronized with 
the transmitter) 
 ( ) ( ) ( )= +n n ny GPs v ,  (2.2) 
where

matrix with

as the first column, and ( )nv  is the noise component. 
The frequency-domain equalization strategy, which 
exploits the circulant nature of G , can be 
implemented based on [3]. To this end, the channel 
information must be known at the receiver. Based on 
the pre-FFT data model (2.2), this project proposes a 
blind channel identification algorithm by using the 
second-order statistics of the received signal and the 
knowledge of the modulating sequence ( )p n . We 
make the following assumptions: (a) the source 
sequence ( )s n  is i.i.d. with zero mean and 
*( ) ( ) ( )δ= −Es k s l k l , where ( )δ ⋅  is the Kronecker 
delta function, (b) the noise ( )v n  is white Gaussian 
with zero mean, variance 2vσ , and is uncorrelated with 
( )s n , (c) the channel order L is known and ≥cpL L . 
III. BLIND CHANNEL IDENTIFICATION 
A. Identification Equations 
We will first consider the noiseless case. The 
proposed approach directly estimates the channel 
impulse response coefficients ( )h n , 0 ≤ ≤n L , and 
lies in exploiting the circulant structure of the channel 
matrix G . More specifically, let us define the ×N N  
permutation matrix

Since G  is circulant, it can be expressed in terms of 
its first column as

Based on (2.2), (3.2), and assumption a), the 
autocorrelation matrix of the block received signal

 (3.3) 
For a given (0)yR , the matrix equation (3.3) defines 
a set of 2N  scalar nonlinear equations in the 
unknowns (0),  ,  ( )"h h L . However, if we consider 
the product channel coefficients of the form 
*( ) ( )h k h l  as unknowns, we have a set of 2N  linear 
equations. As a result, in lieu of directly solving for 
(0),  ,  ( )"h h L , we propose to first compute the 
product coefficients *( ) ( )h k h l , 0 ,≤ ≤k l L . We also 
note from (3.3) that (0)yR  is a weighted sum of N 
rank-one matrices, each being an outer product of the 
circularly shifted zero-padding channel impulse 
response vector g . In light of this observation, we 
can further rearrange the 2N  linear equations defined 
in (3.3) in a more tractable expression, based on 
which there will be a systematic way of solving for 
the product coefficients. Toward this end, we need 
the following lemma. 
Lemma 3.1 [5, p-255]: The matrix equation

By definition of the Kronecker product, equation (3.4) 
can be further rearranged into 
 4
a sufficient condition for channel identifiability is that 
Q  is nonsingular. Based on the block circulant 
structure of Q , there is an elegant way of specifying 
this sufficient condition. More precisely, we have the 
following proposition. 
Proposition 3.2: Let F  be the ×N N  FFT matrix and 
define 
2 2 2: [ (0) (1) ( 1) ]= − ∈ℜ"T Np p p Np . (3.10) 
Then the matrix Q  defined in (3.5) is nonsingular if 
and only if the vector Fp  contains no zero entries.                                     
  
  Prop. 3.2 asserts that channel identifiability is 
guaranteed if there are no “spectral nulls” associated 
with the N-dimensional vector p  defined in (3.10). 
This condition holds for almost all choices of the 
modulation sequence ( )p n . In particular, we can 
appropriately choose ( )p n  to guarantee channel 
identifiability and, moreover, to obtain a well-
conditioned equation (3.8) against noise perturbation 
and finite-sample effect. This will be shown in next 
section. 
IV. OPTIMAL DESIGN OF MODULATING 
SEQUENCE 
This section considers the noisy case and 
addresses the problem of modulating sequence design 
for combating the noise effect. By examining the 
noise-perturbed equations, we will first introduce the 
design criterion. By further exploiting the BCCB 
structure of the matrix Q , the optimization problem 
is then formulated as a constrained quadratic problem 
which yields an analytic solution. Some properties 
regarding the optimal solution are discussed. 
A. Optimality Criterion 
  Assume that the channel noise is present. From (2.2) 
and (3.3), the autocorrelation matrix of the block 
received signal is thus 
( )1 2 2
0
(0) ( )  σ−
=
⎛ ⎞= +∑⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠
N nn H T
v N
n
p nyR J gg J I .  (4.1) 
By following the same procedures as shown in 
Section III, the equations for computing the product 
channel coefficients, viz., the noisy version of (3.8), 
then becomes 
2( (0)) ( ) ( )σ= + H v Nvec vec vecyR Q hh I .  (4.2) 
Since the noise variance 2σ v  is unknown, it is in 
general impossible to determine the exact solution 
( )Hvec hh  from the noisy data. For a given (0)yR , 
we can only instead compute the least squares 
solution, given as 
( ) 1( ) : ( (0))−= =  H T TLSvec vec yhh Q Q Q R                        
( ) 12( ) ( )σ −+   H T Tv Nvec vechh Q Q Q I . (4.3) 
From (4.3), it is easy to see that the least squares 
solution coincides with the exact solution if, and only 
if, the noise signature ( )Nvec I  is orthogonal to the 
range space of Q , that is, 
2( 1) 1( ) + ×= T N LvecQ I 0 . (4.4) 
In fact, if we think of the product channel coefficients 
( )Hvec hh  as the signal of interest in (4.2), the range 
space of Q  then defines the signal subspace, whereas 
the noise perturbation signature ( )Nvec I  spans the 
noise subspace. Accordingly, the condition (4.4) 
amounts to the requirement that the signal and noise 
subspaces are mutually orthogonal. Since the matrix Q  is completely determined by the modulating 
sequence ( )p n , one natural design criterion, therefore, 
is to choose ( )p n  to meet the orthogonality constraint 
(4.4), or to match it as exactly as we can if perfect 
fulfillment is impossible. This suggests the following 
performance measure

,  (4.5) 
where 
2∈ℜ Niq  is the ith column of the matrix Q . 
We note that γ  thus defined is the maximal 
correlation index among the pairs of vectors { },  ( ) i Nvecq I  for all 21 ( 1)≤ ≤ +i L ; it gauges the 
worst-case tendency of noise contamination upon all 
the signal components, and thus serves as a good 
measure of “closeness”, and hence orthogonality, 
between the signal and noise subspaces. Small values 
of γ , in particular, imply small noise contribution on 
the desired signals and are expected to yield better 
channel estimation accuracy. To achieve an utmost 
noise reduction, we then propose to minimize the 
quantity γ  in (4.5), subject to the following two 
constraints

The lengths of the symbol block and CP, respectively, 
are 32=N  and 8=cpL ; the source symbols are 
drawn from the QPSK constellation. Throughout the 
simulations, the index of peak power in the optimal 
sequence (4.12) is set to be 0=m . We compare the 
performances of the proposed method with the two 
subspace methods [8], [13] (denoted respectively by 
the d-subspace and s-subspace methods). For fixed 
SNR = 10 dB, Figures 1 shows the respective NMSE 
for different numbers of symbol blocks. From the 
figure, we can see that the performance of the 
proposed method (solid line) is improved as δ  
decreases; this is because a small δ  leads to small 
orthogonality measure (4.13) and hence good 
estimation accuracy. Also, compared with the 
subspace methods, the proposed method performs 
better as long as 0.8δ ≤ ; when 0.8δ =  and the 
number of symbol blocks is as small as 100, there is 
about a 10 dB improvement in the NMSE. Figure 2 
shows the NMSE of the three methods at various 
SNR levels (with 300 symbol blocks). The result 
shows that, in the medium-to-low SNR region (< 10 
dB), the proposed method attains the best 
performance even with 0.9δ =  for small power 
variation. For SNR larger than 10 dB, the output 
NMSE of the method [8] exhibits a fast decay. This is 
not unexpected since, owing to the finite-sample-
convergence property, the deterministic based 
approach can usually yield impressive estimation 
accuracy when SNR is high [11, p-1789]. We note 
that, in the series transmission scenario, similar 
tendency is also observed in [10, p-1942] when 
modulation-based identification is compared with the 
(deterministic) multi-channel subspace methods [7] 
and [12]. We note that, although both the proposed 
approach and the subspace method [13] are statistical 
based in nature, the former can better track the 
channels. This is because the method [13] directly 
relies on the “raw” estimated autocorrelation matrix 
for channel identification, and could be more 
sensitive to the finite-sample estimation errors. For 
the proposed method, the identification equations (3.8) 
would usually remain well-conditioned whenever the 
optimal sequence (4.12) with a moderate δ  (or small) 
is used (for 0.7δ = , the condition number of the 
matrix  TQ Q  is about 3.84). This could act as an 
inbuilt mechanism for combating the effect of 
imperfect data estimation. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
In this project we propose a blind identification 
scheme for the SC-FDE systems based on periodic 
power modulation. The proposed method exploits the 
circulant channel matrix property unique to the SC-
FDE systems as well as the linear relations between 
the autocorrelation matrix and the product channel 
coefficients. The resultant identifiability condition 
inherits the appealing feature common to most TIC-
based approaches: it depends entirely on the 
modulating sequence but not on the channel 
characteristics. In fact, almost all sequences yield the 
channels identifiable. The problem of modulating 
sequence design against noise amounts to a 
constrained quadratic problem which yields a closed-
form solution. Simulation results show that, in the 
low-to-medium SNR region or when the number of 
available data samples is small, the proposed method 
compares favorably with existing subspace 
algorithms applicable to SC-FDE systems.
