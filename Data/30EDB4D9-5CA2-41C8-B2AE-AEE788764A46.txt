Abstract
This project incorporates well-known Taguchi orthogonal arrays, which involve fractional facto-
rials based on orthogonal tables, with the classical simulated annealing to enhance the numerical
convergence and accuracy of the optimal solution for linear and nonlinear optimization problems.
The novel combination of the classical simulated annealing and fractional factorial analysis is
termed the Taguchi-SA herein. The performance of the proposed Taguchi-SA method is evaluated
by computing several representative global optimization problems, such as a multi-modal function,
nonlinear dynamic control and large parameter optimization. The numerical results show that the
proposed Taguchi-SA method markedly outperforms the classical simulated annealing in solving
global optimization problems. Further, the proposed method applies to airfoil optimization design to
examine the effectiveness of the Taguchi-SA method in practical aerodynamic optimization design.
The results of pressure distribution and aerodynamic data, such as lift, drag and pitching moment
coefficients, clearly indicate that the aerodynamic performance of the designed airfoil is better than
the original. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a high-lift airfoil shape design and an
optimal wing planform design to examine the effectiveness of the Taguchi-SA method in practical
aerodynamic optimization design. The aerodynamic data, such as lift, drag and pitching moment
coefficients, clearly indicate that the aerodynamic performance of the present airfoil is better than
that of the original. Moreover, the optimal wing planform obtained by the proposed Taguchi-SA
method also enhances the aerodynamic performance of the airplane.
Keywords: Orthogonal arrays, Taguchi-SA, airfoil optimization design, wing planform design.

2.3 Taguchi-Simulated Annealing Method
Generally, as seen in Eq. (4), the classical SA
method employs a random point-by-point
search to probe a new location in the dimN -
dimensional hyperplane. Population-based GAs
use many individuals to search for possible
optimum positions, and the classical SA
method lacks an inherent and available
mechanism for cooperation among individuals
as indicated in GAs. Therefore, this method is
inefficient in searching for an optimal solution,
especially for large parameter optimization
problems, owing to the large search
dimensions. Figure 1 depicts the probed
processes by the classical SA and Taguchi-SA
methods. The left figure demonstrates that a
point moves from the current position kx

to
the probed position px

, as specified according
to Eq. (4). The probed position is generally
determined randomly. This study performs
factorial experiments, according to orthogonal
tables, to determine the best combination of
design variables for systematically improving
the search ability. The right figure of Fig. 1
shows the movement of a point from the
current position kx

to the best position bestx

,
rather than the one of probed points. The best
position bestx

is determined by a fractional
factorial analysis to derive the optimal
combination of x

from the arrangement of
variable vectors of probed points. Notably, the
orthogonal tables illustrates that the probed
positions are uniformly distributed.

2.5 Illustration of Using Taguchi Factorial
Analysis to a Multi-modal Function
This work uses a multi-modal function to
demonstrate the numerical procedure of frac-

ables. The objective function is follows.

which are {-2.0, 9.0, 6.0, -5.5, 4.0, -2.0, 7.0}
and {4.5, 3.0, -3.0, 4.5, 8.0, 5.0, -2.0}, respec-
tively. These values are selected randomly in
the range [-10,10]. Accordingly, the functional
values of the current and probed states equal
4.18 and 12.09 based on Eq. (7). Eight function
values, 4.18, 11.38, … and 14.15, listed in col-
umn “Output” are obtained by computing Eq. 
(7) using eight design variable sets {-2.0, 9.0,
6.0, -5.5, 4.0, -2.0, 7.0}, {-2.0, 9.0, 6.0, 4.5, 8.0,
5.0, -2.0}, …,and {4.5, 3.0, 6.0, 4.5, 4.0, -2.0, -

tors 1 to 7 to levels “1”and “2”, 1iS and 2iS ,
are {179.4, 442.7, 616.9, 298.0, 502.7, 260.6,

functional value is remarkably increased to

2.6 Algorithm of Taguchi-SA Method
The pseudo-code of the Taguchi-SA
combines the classical SA method with the
Taguchi factional analysis, as follows.

Specify an initial temperature (T ) and a num-
ber of design variables ( dimN );

tial state ( 0k ). In this work, the initial
value 0x equals 100, and each ix is in the in-
terval [-200, 200]. The optimal value can be
analytically expressed in simple form,

In this study, the parameter dimN is chosen as
45, and the optimal value of objective function
equals 16180.4. Figure 5 plots the convergence
histories and optimal solutions obtained using
the two SA methods for Eq. (10). Clearly, the
proposed Taguchi-SA method converges and
reaches the optimal minimum value more rap-
idly than the classical SA method. As displayed
in Fig. 5, the optimal minimum obtained using
the presented Taguchi-SA method is 16180.4,
which is identical to the analytical optimum ob-
tained in calculating *J . The computational
results show that the proposed method outper-
forms the classical SA method in terms of con-
vergence rate.

tions obtained using the classical SA and Ta-
guchi-SA methods for a nonlinear dynamic

both SA methods when applied to large pa-

This function is also a multi-modal problem,
and its analytical minimum is zero. Design
variable values of 50 and 100 are chosen to in-
vestigate the characteristics of the two SA
methods used to solve large parameter optimi-
zation problems. Figure 6 indicates that the Ta-
guchi-SA method performs excellently in terms
of convergence rate and optimal solution for
solving large parameter optimization problems,
whereas the classical SA method is relatively
poor. Clearly, the fractional factorial analysis
considerably improves the intelligent selection
of optimal design variables.

tions obtained using the classical SA and Ta-
guchi-SA methods for 50dim N and
100dim N .
This study also makes a comparison with the
population-based method, such as GA and par-
ticle swarm optimization (PSO). The GA used
herein is a micro-GA proposed by Krishnaku-
mar [16-17], and PSO is the modified PSO de-
veloped by Shi and Eberhart [18] to enhance
the search efficiency of the original PSO [19].
The comparison of the results obtained using
the classical SA, Taguchi-SA, micro-GA and
modified PSO is listed in Table 3. Clearly, the
proposed Taguchi-SA outperforms others in
9airfoil are evaluated to be 44086.0lc ,
00817.0dc , 0826.0mc . Therefore, the
reduction in the pitching-down-moment coeffi-
cient is 9.11 percent. The values of the lift and
drag coefficients both satisfy the design crite-
rion constraints. The ratio of lift to drag im-
proves from 40.62 to 53.92 when using the pre-
sent designed airfoil, resulting an enhancement
in aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, this
work also uses a gradient method [1] as an opti-
mizer for optimizing the airfoil shape. Based on
the gradient optimizer and flow solver, the
aerodynamic data for the designed airfoil are
421.0lc , 0088.0dc , 0817.0mc . Al-
though the coefficient of the pitching-down-
moment obtained using the gradient method is
smaller than the datum obtained using Taguchi-
SA around 1%, the lift coefficient slightly vio-
lates the constraint of lift. Moreover, the ratio
of lift to drag equals 47.84, and which is
smaller than the present design obtained using
the Taguchi-SA method.

LS(1)-0417 Mod. airfoils.
3.3 Optimization Design of Wing Planform
The proposed Taguchi-SA is also applied to
the wing planform optimization design of an
airplane. This work uses an efficient drag esti-
mation program [23] to calculate the minimum
drag forces from the subsonic to supersonic
speeds. Moreover, this work employs a vortex
strip code [24] to analyze the aerodynamic data
of force and moment for an aircraft.
When the Mach number of the flying speed
of an airplane approaches one, a significant in-
crease in gradient drag always occurs due to the
shock waves acting on the surfaces of the fuse-
lage, wing, and tails. Therefore, an optimal air-
plane design with low drag force is desirable
for improving flight performance at supersonic
speeds. Because the wing planform design is
the most significant influence on flight per-
formance, this study chooses the swept-back
angle )( LE , aspect ratio )(AR , and taper ra-
tio )( of the wing as the design variables
for optimization. The fuselage and tails are
maintained as in the original configurations. In
the computation, the reference wing area and
exposed wing area are set constant and are
identical to the original. The original swept-
back angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio of the
wing planform are 44.31 , 3.063 and 0.2368,
respectively. Accordingly, this works employs
design variables for LE , AR and  within
the ranges [30, 50], [2, 4] and [0.2, 0.3]. The
objective function minimizes the drag coeffi-
cient ( DC ) of the airplane. Furthermore, the
constraints are 0/1 0  LL CC and
01/ 0 MM CC . The suffix “0”denotes the
solution of the original airplane. The optimal
swept-back angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio of
the wing planform obtained using the Taguchi-
SA are 60737.33 , 3.1915 and 0.20949, re-
spectively. Additionally, the values of the
swept-back angle, aspect ratio and taper ratio of
the designed wing planform obtained using the
gradient method are 80244.33 , 3.226986 and
0.20000. Figure 10 demonstrates the compari-
son of the original and presented optimal wing
planforms. The swept-back angle, aspect ratio
and span of the designed wing are larger than
the original; whereas, the taper ratio of the de-
signed wing is smaller that the original. Figure
11 displays that the reductions of the average
