在車載資通訊的網路環境中，不論使用 3G、WiMAX、GPS、Wi-Fi或DSRC等傳輸技
術，所有應用系統都是在開放的無線網路環境下提供服務，也因此無可避免的會遭遇各種
資通安全的威脅與攻擊；更嚴重的是，同樣的安全攻擊在傳統的IT系統可能只是破壞硬碟

訊中資訊安全的重要。雖然IEEE 1609車載資通訊傳輸技術標準中的IEEE 1609.2定義了一
些安全服務，然而其所提供的安全服務僅是基本的機密性、完整性、確認性及不可否認性，
但對於使用者非常擔心的隱私問題卻無有效的解決方案。因此，本計畫的主要目的之一是
要研究發展一個具保障隱私的匿名認證機制(Anonymous Authentication Mechanism)，主要

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II reviews the Yim-Choi-Kim scheme. In Section III,
we describe the strong unlinkability weakness of the Yim-
Choi-Kim scheme. Section IV presents our improvement.
Section V gives a conclusion.
II. THE YIM-CHOI-KIM SCHEME
A. System Model
There are three entities in the system: CA, vehicles with
OBUs, and RSUs. CA is in charge of the registration of
vehicles and RSUs. The RSUs are subordinated by the CA,
which hold storage units for storing information coming
from the CA and the vehicles. The OBUs are installed on
the running vehicles, which mainly communicate with each
other for sharing local traffic information. CA is fully trusted
by all parties in the system, while RSUs at road side may
be compromised by an attacker and in collusion with each
other.
B. Initiation
Let G be a multiplicative group of prime order q and g be
a generator of G. Let H1 : {0, 1}∗ → G, H2 : {0, 1}∗ → G,
and H3 : {0, 1}∗ → Zq be distinct hash functions modeled
as random oracles. These above are public parameters in the
system.
The key generation for vehicle v is as follows: The HSM
(Hardware Security Module) [19] in vehicle v picks up a
random element xv in Zq and computes yv = gxv . The
public key of v is pkv = {g, yv, G} and the corresponding
private key is skv = {pkv, xv}. The vehicle v registers his
public key to CA.
The CA classifies newly legitimate vehicle v into several
new groups depend on the vehicle’s attributes. For example,
v will be classified into group X as X = {· · · , v, · · ·}. The
CA then makes an ordered public key list for group X as
pkX = (· · · , pkv, · · ·).
In addition, each RSU Ri also has a private/public key
pair (skRi , pkRi), in which the public key has a correspond-
ing certificate signed by the CA. The certificate CertRi is
formed as follows.
CertRi = {Ri, pkRi , Expirationtime, SigskCA}
In the above, SigskCA denotes a signature signed on a given
message using the private key of the CA.
C. Authentication and Key Agreement
To access VANETs, a vehicle v and a RSU Ri perform
an authenticated key agreement protocol as follows.
1) Ri −→ v: α, αnRi , ts1, SigskRi , CertRi
The RSU Ri selects a random number nRi ∈ Z∗q ,
a random generator α in G and computes αnRi . Ri
signs on α, αnRi and current timestamp ts1. Then Ri
broadcasts the following message:
α, αnRi , ts1, SigskRi , CertRi
Each RSU will broadcast this message periodically to
declare service existence.
2) v −→ Ri: s, αnv , αr, ts2, ŜigRi,v
After receiving this message, a vehicle v proceeds as
follows.
a) First v verifies that ts1 is valid to prevent replay
attack. Then v confirms CertRi to verify pkRi
and the certificate expiration time. Also v verifies
SigskRi using pkRi .
b) If all the verifications are positive, v believes that
Ri is legitimate and executes the following:
i) First v selects two random numbers
nv, r ∈ Z∗q and computes αnv , αr.
Then v finds current index s and makes
m = (s, αnv , αr, ts2), where ts2 is
current timestamp. v also prepares the
tag L = {s, issue, pkX}. The value s
is the index which is not used and will
be exhausted at this time for generating
signature. The item issue can be an arbitrary
string in {0, 1}∗ and, in case of v, it will be
concatenation of the group identifier X and
the service expiration time of v.
ii) v computes h = H1(L) and σv = hxv , using
xv ∈ Zq .
iii) v sets A0 = H2(L,m) and A1 =
(σv/A0)
1/v .
iv) For all i 6= v in group X , v computes σi =
A0A
i
1 ∈ G. Notice that every (i, logh(σi))
is on the line defined by (0, logh(A0)) and
(v, xv), where xv = logh(σv).
v) v generates signature (cX , zX) on (L,m),
based on a non-interactive zero-knowledge
proof of knowledge for the relation derived
from language L = {(L, h, σX)|∃v′ ∈ X
such that logg(yv′) = logh(σv′)}, where
σX = (· · · , σv, · · ·), as follows: v first picks
up random wv ∈ Zq and sets av = gwv , bv =
hwv ∈ G. Second, v picks up at random
zi, ci ∈ Zq , and sets ai = gziyciv , bi =
hziσcii ∈ G for every i 6= v. Next, v sets
c = H3(L,A0, A1, aX , bX) where aX =
(· · · , av, · · ·) and bX = (· · · , bv, · · ·). Fi-
nally, v sets cv = c −
∑
i 6=v ci(mod q) and
zv = wv − cvxv(mod q). v then generates
(cX , zX), where cX = (· · · , cv, · · ·) and
zX = (· · · , zv, · · ·), as a proof of L.
c) v generates ŜigRi,v = (A1, cX , zX) as the sig-
nature on (L,m).
d) v computes the shared symmetric key with Ri:
KRi,v = (α
nRi )nv .
e) v sends the following back to Ri:
s, αnv , αr, ts2, ŜigRi,v

Abstract—For telematics applications, entity authentication
between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) with vehicle
anonymity plays an important role on providing security and
privacy. In 2009, Yim, Choi, and Kim proposed an anony-
mous authentication protocol in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks
(VANETs) for communications between vehicles and RSUs. The
Yim-Choi-Kim scheme employs a traceable ring signature with
t-times anonymity as a building block. The t-times anonymity
is for the privacy requirement of movement tracking avoidance,
however, it has a weakness in the strong unlinkability property.
This paper improves the weakness of the Yim-Choi-Kim
scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
The communication technology of ad hoc network [1] is
very applicable to the vehicular environment. The Vehicular
Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) [2] provide communications
among nearby vehicles and between vehicles and roadside
units (RSUs) [3]. Thus, the VANET technology is very
suitable to collect up-to-date location based information.
Many different feasible telematics applications will provide
many different services to the vehicle driver, for example,
traffic safety information or warning messages.
In VANETs, vehicles equipped with onboard units
(OBUs) can communicate with each other and with roadside
units (RSUs), which are located at critical points on the
road. In such an environment, there are many challenges,
especially in the aspects of security and privacy [4]. Many
anonymous authentication protocols [5], [6], [7], [8], [9],
[10], [11] that provide mutual authentication and privacy
preservation have been developed for secure vehicular com-
munications. Most of them are based on the public key
infrastructure (PKI) in which the certificate authority (CA)
is responsible for certificate issuing and revocation. Further-
more, the privacy preservation in VANETs is conditional,
where vehicles are anonymous to RSUs while traceable by
the CA. With traceability, the CA can reveal the source
identity of a message once a dispute occurs.
In 2007, Lin et al. proposed a secure and privacy preserv-
ing protocol GSIS [6] for vehicular communications based
on group signature [12] and identity based signature [13].
The GSIS protocol not only meets privacy, anonymity, and
other basic cryptographic requirements, but also provides
traceability of each vehicle. When any dispute occurs, the
identity of the vehicle is revealed by the authority. A short
group signature scheme [14] is employed to secure messages
launched by OBUs, where messages can be securely and
anonymously signed by senders, while the identities of
senders can be recovered by authorities. The RSUs use
an identity based signature scheme to sign each message
launched by RSUs to ensure their authenticity. But this
protocol has vulnerabilities deal with vehicle movement
tracking [6] when many of the RSUs are captured by
attacker.
In 2008, Lu et al. proposed a conditional privacy preserva-
tion protocol for secure vehicular communications based on
bilinear pairing, called ECPP [7]. The ECPP protocol also
provides privacy, anonymity, and traceability. But this proto-
col has vulnerabilities deal with vehicle movement tracking
when many of the RSUs are compromised. It is character-
ized by the generation of on-the-fly short-time anonymous
keys between OBUs and RSUs. And it can efficiently deal
with the growing revocation list while achieving conditional
traceability by the authorities. Zhang et al. [8] proposed a
location privacy preserving authentication scheme based on
blind signature in the elliptic curve domain. For user location
privacy, they use the BLS short signature [15], which is
employed to hide the identity and the trajectory of a vehicle.
The location privacy preserving authentication scheme con-
sider re-authentication when vehicle has handover process
in between RSU and the other RSUs. So it has fast re-
authentication method.
In 2009, Yim, Choi, and Kim et al. [9] proposed an
anonymous authentication protocol in vehicular ad-hoc net-
works based on traceable ring signature [16] with t-times
anonymity [17]. A ring signature scheme [18] allows a
signer to sign a message while preserving anonymity behind
a group. The original traceable ring signature [16] has
a gentle anonymity restriction, which prohibits excessive
anonymity and considers “one-more unforgeability” and
“double-spending traceability”. The Yim-Choi-Kim scheme
uses t-times anonymity to loosen anonymity restriction for
the privacy requirement of movement tracking avoidance.
However, it has a weakness in the strong unlinkability. This
paper improves the weakness of the Yim-Choi-Kim scheme.

3) Ri −→ v: αnv , αnRi , EKRi,v (Ri, αnv , αnRi )
After receiving this message from v, Ri carries out
the following to authenticate v.
a) Ri verifies ts2 and αr to make sure the freshness
of this message from v and also checks s by
confirming 1 ≤ s ≤ t where t is the access
number of v at maximum.
b) Ri verifies that ŜigRi,v is a valid signature as
follows:
i) Ri generates L as {s, issue, pkX} and
checks g,A1 ∈ G, ci, zi ∈ Zq , and yi ∈ G
for all i ∈ X .
ii) Ri computes ai = gziycii and bi = h
ziσcii
for all i ∈ X .
iii) Ri verifies that H3(L,A0, A1, aX , bX) ≡∑
i∈X ci(mod q), where aX = (· · · , ai, · · ·)
and bX = (· · · , bi, · · ·).
iv) If all the verifications are positive, Ri be-
lieves v is a legitimate vehicle and accepts
its access to the network, otherwise rejects.
c) Ri further computes the shared symmetric key
with v as KRi,v = (α
nv )nRi .
d) Ri sends the following back to v:
αnv , αnRi , EKRi,v (Ri, α
nv , αnRi ),
where EK(m) denotes the output of symmetric
encryption of m using the shared key K.
III. THE UNLINKABILITY PROBLEM
Tag-linkability (One-more unforgeability) is one of the
security requirements of a traceable ring signature. That is,
every two signatures generated by the same signer with re-
spect to the same tag are linked. The Yim-Choi-Kim scheme
introduces t-times anonymity for the privacy requirement
of movement tracking avoidance. Thus, for unlinkability,
each vehicle is enough careful not to use the same index
twice on the same tag. For continuous n times signatures
(n ≤ t), a vehicle prepares the tag Li = {si, issue, pkX}
with different si for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Even issue and pkX are
the same in these n tags, RSUs are still unable to determine
which member in X is the actual signer for each signature.
However, if two signatures have the same tag and index,
it implies that these two signatures have been generated by
different vehicles in the same group X . In the Yim-Choi-
Kim scheme, it is possible that two different vehicles that
belong to the same group X use the same index s in the tag.
In such a situation, though RSUs are still unable to determine
the actual signers for these two signatures, it violates the
notion of strong unlinkability. Here, the informal definition
of weak unlinkability is that no one can determine any two
different signatures are generated by the same signer, while
strong unlinkability is that no one can determine any two
different signatures are not generated by the same signer.
IV. THE IMPROVEMENT
The collision-free choice of index s, where 1 ≤ s ≤
t and t is a (limited) maximum access number, from two
different vehicles in the same group X is inherently difficult,
if no negotiation between these two vehicles or via a trusted
third party. Note that RSUs may be compromised and are
assumed to be untrusty. However, if the index s is a result
of a collision-free random number generator, we can say
that two different vehicles that belong to the same group X
will not use the same index s in the same tag. In addition,
for traceability to CA, we introduce a signcryption [20] on
vehicle’s long-term identity. Due to the limitation of space,
the following just describe the portion of improvement on
the Yim-Choi-Kim scheme.
In 2).b).i) of authentication and key agreement phase, First
v selects two random numbers nv, r ∈ Z∗q and computes
αnv , αr. Then v selects index s from a collision-free random
number generator and makes m = (ei, αnv , αr, ts2), where
ts2 is current timestamp and ei is a CA’s signcryption on ve-
hicle’s long-term identity 1 ≤ i ≤ t (t is the access number
of v at maximum). Every vehicle gets t CA’s signcryptions
on its long-term identity in the initial registration phase. v
also prepares the tag L = {s, issue, pkX}. The item issue
can be an arbitrary string in {0, 1}∗ and, in case of v, it will
be concatenation of the group identifier X and the service
expiration time of v.
In 3).a) of authentication and key agreement phase, Ri
verifies ts2 and αr to make sure the freshness of this
message from v and also verifies ei is a CA’s signature.
Now, Ri confirms that this message comes from a legitimate
vehicle, but still does not know the actual identity of the
vehicle. When a dispute occurs later, CA can easily trace
the actual identity of the vehicle from ei.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper improves the weakness of the Yim-Choi-Kim
scheme which is an anonymous authentication protocol in
Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) based on a traceable
ring signature with t-times anonymity. We use the ap-
proach of collision-free randoms for the strong unlinkability
problem of the Yim-Choi-Kim scheme. Also, the vehicle
traceability to CA is achieved by using CA’s signcryption.

transport, access control cards, event ticketing and management, and, more recently, 
in government identity cards and passports, and extensively in manufacturing supply 
chains and in logistics for goods distribution. RFID system provides convenience but 
also introduces new RFID security challenges. The main security risk is the 
unauthorized identification. Hence, the RFID authentication protocol plays an 
important role in RFID security. 
 
Due to its low-cost, the use of a RFID tag has several limitations in hardware. The 
number of logic gates in a RFID tag is about 5K-10K in which only 250-4K (López, 
2008) can be used for security operations. Thus, traditional cryptographic functions 
like AES, MD5 and SHA-1 cannot be supported in a low-cost RFID tag. 
 
In 2007, Chien (Chien, 2007) categorized the RFID tags into four classes based on the 
computational cost and the operations supported. The first class called full-fledged 
refers to those tags that support conventional cryptographic functions like symmetric 
encryption, cryptographic one-way function, or even the public key algorithms. The 
second class called simple is for those tags that support random number generator and 
one-way hash function. The third class called lightweight is for those tags that require 
a random number generator and simple functions like Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) 
checksum but not hash function. The fourth class called ultralightweight refers to 
those tags that only involve simple bitwise operations like XOR, AND, OR, etc. 
 
The number of logic gates on ultralightweight tags is very limited. Conventional 
cryptographic functions cannot be supported in ultralightweight tags. Chien also 
proposed an authentication protocol, called SASI, for ultralightweight tags. However, 
some weaknesses (Cao et al., 2009) (Sun et al., 2009) in SASI were presented later. In 
2008, López et al. proposed another ultralightweight authentication protocol, called 
Gossamer (Lopez et al., 2008), and they claimed that Gossamer is more secure than 
SASI. Though the authors of Gossamer declared that Gossamer’s implementation cost 
is similar to SASI and it is more secure than SASI, its design is too complicated to 
analyze its security. In this paper, we will design a new ultralightweight RFID 
authentication protocol in layered approach in which the authentication protocol is 
based on secure primitives and it leads to its security is easy to analyze. 
 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related works. 
Section 3 introduces our ultralightweight hash primitive which is developed by 
genetic programming. Then, our proposed ultralightweight authentication protocol 
based on the ultralightweight hash primitive is presented in Section 4. Section 5

programs or, alternatively, mathematical functions. They are usually represented 
as parse trees, made of functions (with arguments), and terminals. The initial 
population is made of randomly generated individuals. 
 A fitness function, which is used to measure the goodness of the given computer 
program represented by the individual. Usually, this is done by executing the 
codified function over many different inputs, and analyzing its outputs. 
 A set of genetic operators. In GP, the basic operators are reproduction, mutation, 
and crossover. Reproduction does not change the individual. Mutation changes a 
function, a terminal, or a complete subtree. The crossover operator exchanges 
two subtrees from two parent individuals, thereby combining characteristics from 
both of them into the offspring. 
 
The GP algorithm starts a cycle consisting on fitness evaluation and application of the 
genetic operators, thus producing consecutive generations of populations of computer 
programs, until an ending condition is reached. 
 
3.1 Implementation 
 
In this section, we use the lil-gp genetic programming library (Bill, 1995) to construct 
an ultralightweight hash function. We adjust the parameters in a GP toolkit of lil-gp to 
fit our requirement. 
 
1. Function Set 
Firstly, we define the set of functions we needed: xor (bitwise xor), vrotd (right 
rotation) and sum (bitwise sum). 
2. Terminal Set 
In the terminal set, we need two 32-bit random integers (a0, a1) for our hash 
function algorithm. 
3. Fitness Function 
The fitness of every individual is calculated as follows: First, we use the link 
http://randomnumber.org/ to generate two 32-bit random values (a0, a1) and store 
as O0. Then, we randomly flip one single bit of one of the two input values, and 
output as O1. Now, we compute and store the Hamming distance H(O0, O1) 
between those two output values. This process is repeated a number of times for a 
perfect Avalanche Effect.  
4. Tree Size Limitations 
When using genetic programming approaches, it is necessary to put some limits to 
the depth and/or to the number of nodes the resulting trees could have. We did not

4. The Proposed Ultralightweight RFID Authentication Protocol 
 
In the proposed protocol, the back-end database server uses a pseudo random number 
generator (PRNG) to generate a random number n1 for each round. For each tag, the 
information stored in the server includes: an identity (ID), an anonymous identity 
(IDS), and two secret keys (K1, K2), where the length of ID, IDS, K1, K2 are 96 bits. 
In each tag, it stores the identity ID with two sets (old and next) of anonymous 
identity and secret keys (IDSold, K1old, K2old), (IDSnext, K1next, K2next). 
 
There are three phases in the protocol: tag identification, mutual authentication and 
key update. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed protocol and Table 3 lists the symbols 
used in the protocol.

5. Security and Cost Analysis 
 
5.1 Security Analysis  
 
1. Mutual authentication 
In the proposed protocol, only valid readers that own shared secret keys (K1, K2) 
can compute correct message A||B. Also, only valid tag that own shared secret 
keys (K1, K2) can get n1 from A and compute correct message C. 
2. Tag anonymity 
The anonymous identity IDS and secret keys (K1, K2) are updated every round 
with a random number n1 and hash function. The public messages A, B, and C are 
also embedded with the random number n1. Thus, these values and messages for

RAM with length 96×6=576 bits. Thus, the total length is 7L, where L denotes the 
length of each item. 
3. Communication cost 
The transmitted messages for each round are Hello, IDS, A||B and C. They are 
(96×4)+40=424 bits and are about 4L. Table 5 shows the cost comparison of the 
proposed protocol with U-MAP protocols and SASI.

4. Hardware overhead 
The limitation of clock cycle in an ultralightweight RFID tag is 100 KHz (Lopez 
et al., 2006). It means that a tag must responds reader’s request within 100K clock 
cycles. Also, in an ultralightweight RFID tag, the number of logic gate for security 
is about 250-4K. Table 6 shows the needed number of logic gate and clock cycle 
in the proposed protocol.

Table 6 shows that the number of logic gate in our proposed protocol does not exceed 
the limitation of an ultralightweight RFID tag (250-4K). Hence, our proposed protocol 
can be effectively implemented in an ultralightweight RFID tag.
