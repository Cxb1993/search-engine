graphene. Then, the graphene deposited with Pt particles were put in ethylene glycol for a reflux at 120, 150 
and 180 °C for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.  
The results show that the electrode catalyst Pt particles have a smaller size and a better distribution on 
the surface of graphene under the following reducing condition: two-step reduction, reaction time of 12 hours, 
reaction temperature of 150 °C and the 1g/L of H2PtCl6. This PtNPs/GN composites exhibits superior 
electrochemically active surface area and high poison tolerance toward methanol oxidation compared to 
Vulcan XC-72-Pt with the same Pt content. This reveal that the PtNPs/GN can be used as promising 
electrocatalyst supports for direct methanol fuel cells.

1. Introduction 
Fuel cell is a device which can convert chemical energy into electrical energy directly and hence has 
higher energy conversion efficiency. Besides higher energy conversion efficiency fuel cell also has another 
advantage, that is, its chemical product in reaction process is only water. This is conformed the request for 
environmental safety. Therefore, Fuel cell is considered as the fourth technique for generating electricity 
following thermo-power, hydraulic power and nuclear power generation [1-3]. 
    PEMFC is one of fuel cells, which has been paid more and more attention recently due to its 
characteristics, i.e. high power densities, low weight, cost, volume and operation temperature, rapid start, 
without corrosive electrolyte and other advantages possessed by general fuel cells. PEMFC is very fit for

value (159.48 m2g−1) and less carbonaceous accumulation. 
 
2.  Experimental 
 In this work, the graphene oxide (GO) sheets were synthesized by modified Hummers and Offeman’s 
method [28]. Through this process, the natural graphite powder was exfoliated by strong oxidizing agent 
(KMnO4+ H2O2). For obtaining electrode catalyst Pt particles with a smaller size uniformly deposited on the 
surface of graphene (the Pt nanoparticles/graphene composites, which will be denoted by PtNPs/GN 
thereafter). The parameters, such as temperature, time and concentration, for the reduction of Pt were studied. 
The PtNPs/GN was produced by two different routes. One typical route (denoted one-step route), Pt 
nanoparticles were deposited on GO sheets by a chemical reduction of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) in 
ethylene glycol-water solution. The PtNPs/GN was manufactured as follows: GO (45 mg) were dispersed in 
40 mL of ethylene glycol by ultrasonic treatment 2 h. Then variable weight of H2PtCl6·6H2O was added under 
stirring. And the pH value of this mixture was adjusted to 2 using HCl. Finally the solution reflux at 120 
and150 °C for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. After rinsing and filtrating, the PtNPs/GN was dried at 60 
°C for 24 hours. The other typical route (denoted two-step route), GO (45 mg) were dispersed in 100 mL of 
ultrapure water by ultrasonic treatment 2 h. Then 800 mg NaBH4 was slowly added to the mixture, with 
stirring for 1 h under 80 °C. After this treatment, the graphene/GO was filtration, washed, and finally 
dispersed to DI water, denoted as GNs. Ethylene glycol (40 mL) and a variable weight of H2PtCl6·6H2O were 
added to 50 mL of the as-obtained GNs dispersion with magnetic stirring for 30 min. Finally the solution 
reflux at 120, 150, and 180 °C for 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. After rinsing and filtrating, the

 Figure 1(a) illustrates the one-step route of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites. Firstly, graphite oxide (GO) was 
prepared by chemical oxidation of graphite according to modified Hummers and Offeman’s method. Then, the 
GO nanosheets and H2PtCl6 were added to ethylene glycol under stirring. Finally, the composites of graphene 
decorated by Pt nanoparticles were obtained via reflux. Figure 1(b) illustrates the two-step route of PtNPs/GN 
nanocomposites. Firstly, graphite oxide (GO) was prepared by chemical oxidation of graphite according to 
modified Hummers and Offeman’s method. Then, the GNs were obtained via chemical reduction of GO using 
NaBH4 as reducing agent. Thereafter, the GNs and H2PtCl6 were added to ethylene glycol under stirring. 
Finally, the composites of graphene decorated by Pt nanoparticles were obtained via reflux.  
 
3.1 Characterization and evaluation of one-step route of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites 
To find the optimum reducing time for obtaining catalyst Pt particles with a smaller size and a better 
distribution on graphene, various reduction reactions of H2PtCl6·6H2O in ethylene glycol were carried out at 
120 and 150 °C for 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours, respectively, in which the weight of H2Pt Cl6·6H2O is 50mg/100ml 
(0.5g/L) and 100mg/100ml (1g/L). The XRD patterns of the original graphite, GO, and PtNPs/GN 
nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 2. For original graphite, the diffraction peaks at around 2 = 26.5° can be 
indexed to the (0 0 2) reflection of graphite. The other diffraction peaks at 2 angles of 26.5–77.5° in the XRD 
pattern can be assigned to hexagonal crystalline graphite. The broad peak at around 2 = 11.5° can be 
assigned to GO. It can be indexed to the (0 0 2) reflection of GO. The native graphite position peak at about 
26.5° disappears, implying the successful oxidation of the starting graphite. As shown in the XRD pattern of 
PtNPs/GN, the suppression of the GO peak indicates that the composite contained few layer graphene sheets.

catalyst Pt particles distribute on the surface of graphene is quite uniform (Fig. 4 (c)). However, in the case of 
the sample reflux at 120 °C for 24 hours, it can be seen that part of the Pt nanoparticles form aggregates (Fig. 
4(d)). This is probably caused by the longer time of reduction to make Pt nanoparticles form aggregates.  
To evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites, cyclic 
voltammogram (CV) experiments were performed in a solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scanning rate of 20 mVs-1. 
Fig. 5 shows the current density variation of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites with voltage in CV test for Pt 
particles were reduced on graphene in a solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O 1g/L at 120 °C for 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours, 
respectively. The electrochemically active surface area was estimated by integrating the voltammogram 
corresponding to hydrogen desorption from the electrode surface. The ECSAs for the reducing time 3, 6, 12, 
and 24 hours were estimated to be 10.71, 13.62, 43.93, and 23.2 m2g-1, respectively. Fig. 6 illustrated the 
ECSAs of samples reflux at temperature 120 and 150 °C with a reducing time range from 3 to 24 hours. 
Except the sample that was reflux at 120 °C in H2PtCl6·6H2O 0.5g/L. The ECSA increases as reducing time 
increases, reaches a maximum at 12h, and decreases for reducing time longer than12 hr. From the results of 
TEM plan views and ECSA test, the optimum reducing temperature is 120 °C at 12 hours in a solution of 
H2PtCl6·6H2O 1g/L for obtaining Pt particles with a smaller size uniformly deposited on graphene and a better 
ECSA accordingly, and the high ECSAs were favorable to electrochemical oxidation toward methanol. 
 
3.2 Properties of two-step route of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites 
Fig. 7 shows the current density variation of PtNPs/GN nanocomposites with voltage in CV test for Pt 
particles were reduced on graphene in a solution of 1g/L H2PtCl6·6H2O at 120 °C and 150 °C for 3, 6, 12, and

m2/g)[32], functionalized graphene and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes [Pt/(f-G-f-MWNT)]/ Pt 
NPs hybrids (108 m2/g)[33], The optimum reducing temperature is 150 °C at 12 hours in a solution of 
100mg/100ml H2PtCl6·6H2O for obtaining Pt particles with uniformly deposited on graphene and a better 
ECSA accordingly, and the high ECSAs were favorable to electrochemical oxidation toward methanol.  
Figure 10 shows the weight loss of graphene, one-step and two-step samples, which determined by TGA 
and the corresponding derivatives of the weight loss with respect to temperature. The weight loss around 390 
oC in two-step sample is lower than that of the one-step sample, indicating the decrease of the quantity of 
oxygenated functional groups on the graphene support.[31] The percentage of Pt NPs by weight is estimated, 
based on residue, to be 61 wt % and 78 % for the one-step and two-step samples, respectively. These results 
indicated that the reduction of GO films by NaBH4 can offer many active sites, which facilitates the high 
loading and uniform distribution of PtNPs on graphene. 
The resulting cyclic voltammograms for electro-oxidation of methanol measured at 1 M H2SO4 
containing 2 M CH3OH solutions at a scanning rate of 20 mVs-1.are shown in Fig. 11. As shown in Figure 11, 
the bare GCE does not show any electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of methanol as expected. The 
other two CV curves show a similar methanol oxidation current peak in the forward scan and an oxidation 
peak of residual carbon species in the reverse scan. For PtNPs/GN, The peak current density at about 0.78 V 
(versus SCE) in the forward potential scan and 0.63 V (versus SCE) in the backward potential scan are 8 and 
4.5 mA/cm2, respectively. Fig. 11 also shows that the forward anodic peak current density of PtNPs/GN 
nanocomposites is higher than that of Pt/Vulcan-XC-72. The ratio of the forward anodic peak current (IF) to 
the reverse anodic peak current (IR) can be used to describe the catalyst tolerance to the intermediate

oxides in the last few years. 
  The mechanism of zinc oxide thin films prepared by electrodeposition has been studied by Inamdar, A.I 
et.al.[5], and Yoshida, T. et.al[6]. Mahalingam,T. et.al.[7] have researched the microstructure of 
electrodeposition zinc oxide thin films. The electrochemical behavior of ZnO thin films has been investigated 
by Zhang, lisha et.al.[8]. The ZnO thin porous films have been prepared by cathodic electrodeposition in 
presence of additives, such as different organic acids (benzoic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, 
benzenetetracarboxylic acid) and a surfactant (sodium laurglsulfate) by Michaelis, E. et.al.[9]. Inamdar, A.I 
et.al.[10] have studied the effect of bath temperature on the electrodeposition ZnO and Otani, Shiji et.al.[11] 
have also studied the effect of bath temperature on the electrodeposition mechanism of ZnO. The 
nanocrystalline ZnO thin films have been formed by novel double pulse single step electrodeposition[12].  
  To the best of our knowledge, there are few researches concerning with the effect of anions in the 
electrodeposition baths on the morphologies of zinc oxides. In this work, the K2SO4, KNO3, and CH3COOK 
were respectively added into electrodeposition baths containing ZnCl2 and KCl as host composition to study 
the effects of SO42-, NO3-, and CH3COO- anions on the morphologies of zinc oxides. A formation mechanism 
for the zinc oxide with different shapes was also proposed and discussed. 
 
2. Experimental 
  The zinc oxide thin films were prepared in electrodeposition baths in which a silicon substrate coated with 
Pd metal is taken as the work electrode. A Pt plate is taken as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel 
electrode (SCE) is taken as the reference electrode. Before silicon substrate was coated with Pd metal, it was 
pre-treated [13]. A process containing seven times of sensitization in SnCl2 + HCl solution and activization in

sheet . When the concentration of K2SO4 is larger than 0.5 mM, there are zinc oxides with a shape of curved 
sheet appeared among those with a shape of hexagonal pillar, and the amount of zinc oxides with curved sheet 
shape increases with the increase of K2SO4 concentration. 
 
(c) Effect of pH 
  The morphologies of zinc oxide deposited in baths of ZnCl2 (4 mM) + KCl (50 mM) + K2SO4 (0.5 mM) 
with pH 4.5~8.0 were shown in Fig.3, (A) for pH 4.5 and (B) for pH 7.0. Most zinc oxides in Fig. 3(A) have a 
shape of curved sheet and all zinc oxide in Fig. 3(B) have a sheet of hexagonal pillar. When pH 6 the zinc 
oxides with curved sheet shape begin to appear among those with hexagonal pillar shape, and the amount of 
zinc oxides with curved sheet shape increases with the decrease of pH value. 
 
(d) Effect of CH3COO- anion 
  Fig. 4, (A) for 1 mM CH3COOK and (B) for 15 mM CH3COOK, showed the morphologies of zinc oxides 
deposited in baths of ZnCl2 (4 mM) + KCl (50 mM) + CH3COOK (0.1~50 mM). All zinc oxides in Fig. 4(A) 
have a shape of hexagonal pillar. As shown in Fig. 4(B), some of zinc oxides have a shape of hexagonal plate 
and most of zinc oxides are irregular in shape. When the concentration of CH3COOK is larger than 3 mM the 
zinc oxides with hexagonal plate or irregular shape begin to appear among those with hexagonal pillar shape, 
and the amount of zinc oxides with irregular shape increases with the increase of CH3COOK concentration. 
 
(e) Effect of NO3- anion  
  The morphologies of zinc oxides deposited in baths of ZnCl2 (4 mM) + KCl (50 mM) + KNO3 (0.1~50 mM)

pillar, and when the growth rate of (0001) plane is smaller than that of {01 0} planes the zinc oxides would 
become hexagonal plates, as shown in Fig.6 (A) and (B). 
  From the results of (a)~(e), it can be seen that the zinc oxides became a shape of sheet and hexagonal plate 
under the action of SO42- and CH3COO- anions, respectively. This phenomena can be ascribed to the 
electrochemical absorption of SO42- and CH3COO- on (0001) plane more easily than on {01 0} planes. 
Therefore, the growth rate of (0001) plane is smaller than that of {01 0} planes due to the presence of SO42- 
and CH3COO- anions on (0001) plane, which would hinder the growth of zinc oxides. Under the similar 
reasons, the zinc oxides became a shape of hexagonal pillar under the action of NO3- and Cl- anions, 
respectively, due to the electrochemical absorption of NO3- and Cl- on {01 0} planes more easily than on 
(0001) plane. 
 
4. Conclusion 
  The shape of zinc oxides deposited in baths of ZnCl2 (4 mM) + KCl (10~100mM) , and ZnCl2 (4 mM) + 
KCl (50 mM) + KNO3 (0.1~50 mM) is hexagonal pillar due to the electrochemical absorption of NO3- and Cl- 
on {01 0}planes more easily than on (0001) plane. The shape of zinc oxides deposited in baths of ZnCl2 (4 
mM) + KCl (50 mM) with addition of K2SO4 and CH3COOK became sheet and hexagonal plates due the 
electrochemical absorption of SO42- and CH3COO- on (0001) plane more easily than on {01 0} planes.
