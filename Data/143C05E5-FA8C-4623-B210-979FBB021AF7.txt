proposed method and to compare it with a linear precod-
ing method [12].
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is the
system model and problem statement. In Section 3, we
derive the method for MIMO SC-FDE block transmis-
sion systems and propose an estimation algorithm. The
effect of the precoding scheme on channel equalization is
discussed in Section 4. Simulation results are given in
Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper.
Notations used in this paper are quite standard: Bold
uppercase is used for matrices, and bold lowercase is used
for vectors. AT represents transpose of the matrix A,
and A∗ represents conjugate transpose of the matrix A.
IM is the identity matrix of dimension M × M , and
A ⊗ B is the Kronecker product of matrices A and B.
The symbols R and C stand for the set of real num-
bers and the set of complex numbers, respectively. In
addition, we define the following operations that will
be used in the derivation of the main result. First, for
any m ×m matrix A = [ak,l]0≤k,l≤m−1, define Γj(A) =
[a0,j a1,j+1 · · · am−1−j,m−1]T for 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, i.e.,
Γj(A) is the vector formed from the jth super-diagonal of
A. Second, for any Jn× Jn matrix B = [Bk,l]0≤k,l≤n−1,
where Bk,l is a block matrix of dimension J × J , define
Υj(B) = [BT0,j B
T
1,j+1 · · · BTn−1−j,n−1]T for 0 ≤ j ≤
n−1, i.e., Υj(B) is the matrix formed from the jth block
super-diagonal of B.
2 System Model and Basic As-
sumptions
Consider the K-input J-output discrete time SC-FDE
baseband system shown in Figure 1. At the transmitter,
the kth input signal vk(n) is first multiplied by an M -
periodic sequence, p(n) ∈ R, to obtain sk(n) = p(n)vk(n),
where p(n + M) = p(n), ∀ n. Then sk(n) is stacked
as a block s¯k(i) = [sk(iM) sk(iM + 1) · · · sk(iM +
M − 1)]T ∈ RKM . Then a cyclic prefix (CP), which is
the last P symbols of s¯k(i) is inserted in front of s¯k(i)
to form u¯k(i) ∈ CN , where N = M + P . Finally,
the resultant data block u¯k(i) is parallel-to-serial con-
verted to uk(n) and then transmitted through the MIMO
FIR channel. At the receiver, the jth received signal is
xj(n) =
∑K
k=1
∑Ljk
m=0 hjk(m)uk(n − m) + wj(n), where
wj(n) is the channel noise seen at the jth receiver, and
{hjk(0) hjk(1) · · · hjk(Ljk)} is the impulse response
from the kth transmitter to the jth receiver with order
Ljk.
Let x(n) = [x1(n) x2(n) · · · xJ(n)]T ∈ CJ , w(n) =
[w1(n) w2(n) · · · wJ(n)]T ∈ CJ , and H(l) = [hjk(l)] ∈
CJ×K be the channel coefficient matrix for l =
0, 1, · · · , L, where L = maxj,k{Ljk} is the order of the
MIMO channel. For each received signal xj(n), collect
the received signal into a block of dimension N and then
remove the first P > L symbols in the block. Then the
input-output relation of the system can be described as
follows [13]:

CJM×KM is a block circulant matrix with [H(0)T H(1)T
· · ·H(L)T 0 · · ·0]T ∈ CJM×K being its first block col-
umn.
The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to
blindly identify the MIMO channel coefficient matrices
H(m), 0 ≤ m ≤ L using second-order statistics of the
received data based on the following assumptions.
(i) The source signal v(n) =
[v1(n) v2(n) · · · vK(n)]T ∈ CK is a zero
mean white sequence with E[v(m)v(n)∗] =
δ(m − n)IK ∈ RK×K , where δ(·) is the Kronecker
delta function. The noise is white zero mean
with E[w(m)w(n)∗] = δ(m − n)σ2wIJ ∈ RJ×J . In
addition, the source signal is uncorrelated with the
noise w(n), i.e., E[v(m)w(n)∗] = 0K×J , ∀ m,n.
(ii) The channel impulse response matrix H =
[H(0)T H(1)T · · ·H(L)T ]T ∈ CJ(L+1)×K is full col-
umn rank, i.e., rank(H) = K.
3 Blind Channel Estimation
In this section, we develop the proposed method under
assumptions (i) and (ii). We first derive the estimation
method when noise is absent in Section 3.1. The optimal
design of the precoding sequence when noise is present is
discussed in Section 3.2. Some further discussion about
the proposed method is given in Section 3.3.
3.1 The Estimation Method
Let J ∈ RM×M be a circulant matrix with the first row
equal to [0 0 · · · 0 1] ∈ R1×M . Then HBC can be ex-
pressed as HBC =
∑L
l=0 J
l ⊗H(l), and thus for noiseless
case, (2.1) can be written as
x¯(i) =
(
L∑
l=0
Jl ⊗H(l)
)
s¯(i) (3.1)
Due to precoding, s¯(i) = (G⊗ IK) v¯(i), where
v¯(i) is similarly defined as s¯(i) and G =
2
Thus the constraint MT0Y = 0 in (3.13) is equivalent to
[q0 q1 · · · qL]Tb = 0. (3.15)
If the precoding sequence can be selected to achieve the
orthogonality condition (3.15), the effect of noise is com-
pletely eliminated. But this is impossible since the entries
of q0 q1 · · · qL and b are positive. Therefore we seek
to choose the precoding sequence such that b is as close
to being orthogonal to qi as possible, for i = 0, 1, · · · , L.
Define the following correlation coefficients
γi =
qTi b
‖qi‖2‖b‖2 , i = 0, 1, · · · , L. (3.16)
Since γi is nonnegative and by Cauchy-Schwarz inequal-
ity, 0 ≤ γi ≤ 1. In order to let b be as close to being
orthogonal to each qi as possible, we choose the precod-
ing sequence so that the correlation coefficient γi is as
small as possible for i = 0, 1 · · · , L. However, since for
i = 0, 1, · · · , L, qTi b = (Jip)Tb = pT (Ji)Tb = pTb =∑M−1
m=0 p(m)
2 = qT0 b and ‖qi‖2 =
√∑M−1
m=0 p(m)4 =
‖q0‖2, each γi assumes the same value. Thus we only
need to consider γ0. Based on this point of view, we for-
mulate the optimal selection problem as minimizing γ0
subject to the following two constraints:
1
M
M−1∑
m=0
p(m)2 = 1, (3.17)
p(m)2 ≥ τ > 0, ∀0 ≤ m ≤M − 1. (3.18)
Roughly, constraint (3.17) normalizes the power gain of
the precoding sequence of each transmitter to 1, and con-
straint (3.18) requires that at each instant, the power gain
is no less than τ . Note that the problem of selecting the
optimal precoding sequence is identical to the SISO case
considered in [8], and the resulting optimal sequence is
given by, for any fixed 0 ≤ m ≤M − 1,
p(n) =
{ √
M(1− τ) + τ , n = m√
τ , n 6= m, 0 ≤ n ≤M − 1 (3.19)
In addition, with the optimal solution in (3.19), the corre-
sponding γ0 = 1√
M(1−τ)2+τ(2−τ) . Note that γ0 decreases
as τ decreases, and thus the noise effect in the estimation
of the covariance matrix R is reduced and hence estima-
tion performance improves.
From the solution in (3.19), we know the optimal pre-
coding sequence p(n) is a two-level sequence with a single
peak in one period. However, the peak location, m, does
significantly affect the numerical condition of the linear
equation (3.7) since different choices of m result in differ-
ent matricesMj and the associated condition numbers. If
the condition number ofMj ∈ RJ(M−j)×J(L+1−j) is large,
then the solution Fj is sensitive to data error. However,
we will show that the condition number of Mj is equal
to that of a matrix Pj with a smaller size in the follow-
ing proposition, based on which the selection of the peak
location m is further simplified to the case considered in
[10]. Toward this end, let κ(A) be the condition number
of a matrix A. Then we have the following result.
Proposition 3.2: For j = 0, 1, · · · , L, κ(Mj) =
κ(Pj), where Pj = [q0(1 : M − j, 1) q1(1 : M −
j, 1) · · · qL−j(1 :M − j, 1)] ∈ R(M−j)×(L+1−j).
Proof: See Appendix B.
Let
µ = max
0≤j≤L
κ(Pj). (3.20)
Then our goal is to choose m so as to minimize the
largest condition number of the corresponding matrices
Pj , which is equivalent to minimize the largest condi-
tion number of the corresponding matricesMj according
to Proposition 3.2. The following result shows that the
peak location, m, can be classifed into three groups.
Proposition 3.3:
(a) At least one Pj , 0 ≤ j ≤ L, is not of full column rank
and thus µ =∞ if and only if M − L+ 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 2.
(b) Each of the (M − L) choices, m = 0, m = 1,· · · ,
m =M − L− 1 results in the same µ denoted by µ1.
(c) The two choices m = M − L and m = M − 1 result
in the same µ denoted by µ2. Also µ2 ≥ µ1.
Proof: See [10].
From Proposition 3.3, we know m = 0, or m = 1, ,· · · ,
or m = M − L− 1 will result in the minimum condition
number of µ. Hence the optimal precoding sequence has
a peak which locates at one of the first (M−L) positions.
3.3 Discussion
1) On ambiguity removal: To recover the transmit sig-
nal, some pilot symbols must be inserted in the data
blocks to remove the matrix ambiguity U. From the end
of Section 3.1, we knowH = ĤU, which implies (2.1) can
be written as
x¯(i) = HBC s¯(i)+w¯(i) = ĤBC(IM⊗U)¯s(i)+w¯(i) (3.21)
where ĤBC is the estimate of true channel matrix HBC .
Since Ĥ is of full column rank, ĤBC is also of full
column rank and can be used to form a matrix V =
(Ĥ∗BCĤBC)
−1Ĥ∗BC ∈ CKM×JM . Multiplying x¯(i) by V,
we have
y¯(i) = Vx¯(i) = (IM ⊗U)¯s(i) +Vw¯(i). (3.22)
Let y¯(i) = [y(iM)T y(iM +1)T · · ·y(iM +M − 1)T ]T ∈
CKM and n¯(i) = Vw¯(i) is similarly defined as y¯(i) ∈
CKM . Then (3.22) can be further rearranged as
Y(i) = US(i) +N(i) (3.23)
where Y(i) = [y(iM) y(iM + 1) · · ·y(iM +M − 1)] ∈
CK×M , and S(i) ∈ CK×M and N(i) ∈ CK×M are simi-
larly defined as Y(i). Usually we can let K < M by in-
creasing the stacking number M , which means Y(i) and
S(i) are fat matrices. If the transmitter send a pilot block
S(i) with full row rank, then the matrix ambiguity U can
be approximately solved by
U ≈ Y(i)S(i)∗(S(i)S(i)∗)−1. (3.24)

5 Simulation
In this section, we generate 100 2-input 2-output ran-
dom channels with L = 2 for each simulation (except
simulation 4 and 5) to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed method. We use M = 18 and P = 2.
Each channel coefficient in the channel matrix is gen-
erated according to the independent complexed-valued
Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit vari-
ance. The normalized mean-square-error (NMSE) of the
channel impulse response matrix is defined as NMSE =
(1/I)
∑I
i=1 ‖Ĥ(i) − H‖2F · ‖H‖−2F , where I = 100 is the
number of independent trials, and ‖ · ‖F denotes the
Frobenius norm. Ĥ(i) = [Ĥ(i)(0)T Ĥ(i)(1)T Ĥ(i)(2)T ]T
is the ith estimate of the channel impulse response ma-
trix H after removing the unitary matrix ambiguity by
the least squares method [17]. The number of symbol
blocks is S = 100. The input source symbols are i.i.d.
QPSK signals. The SNR at the output is defined as
SNR = E[‖x(n)−w(n)‖
2
2]
E[‖w(n)‖22] . The channel noise is zero mean,
temporally and spatially white Gaussian.
Simulation 1 – optimal selection of the precod-
ing sequence
In experiment 1, we use 5 precoding sequences which
all satisfy (3.17) and (3.18) to illustrate the effect of the
precoding sequences on the estimation performance. This
simulation demonstrates the results for the four optimal
sequences chosen based on (3.19) with τ = 0.7, but with
m = 0, 15, 16 and 17, respectively, and a nonoptimal
sequence chosen as p(n)2 = 0.7 for 0 ≤ n ≤ 9 and
p(n)2 = 1.3 for 10 ≤ n ≤ 18. Figure 2(a) shows that
NMSE decreases as SNR increases for every precoding
sequence. In this figure, we also see that the optimal pre-
coding sequence (3.19) withm = 0 orm =M−L−1 = 15
yields the smallest NMSE because the peak locates in one
of the first (M − L − 1) position of the sequence, which
results in a smaller condition number µ = 1.6387 than
µ = 3.2198 which is the result of the precoding sequence
(3.19) with m =M − 1 = 17 or m = N − L = 16.
In experiment 2, we use the optimal precoding se-
quences that satisfy (3.19) with m = 0, but with different
τ to test the effect of τ on the estimation performance.
Figure 2(b) shows that the estimation performs better for
smaller τ , which is consistent with our analysis in Section
3.2 .
Simulation 2 – robustness to channel order over-
estimation
In this simulation, we use the precoding sequences that
satisfy (3.19) with m = 0 and fix SNR= 10 dB. For each
upper bound Lˆ, 0 ≤ (Lˆ − L) ≤ 5, we choose P = Lˆ
and M = 9P for simulation such that the transmission
efficiency is maintained at 90%. Figure 3 shows that the
proposed method is robust to channel order overestima-
tion since the NMSE increases slowly for each τ as (Lˆ−L)
increases from 0 to 5.
Simulation 3 – Channels with more transmitters
than receivers
In this simulation, we generate 100 3-input 2-output
random channels to illustrate the performance of the pro-
posed method for channel with more transmitters than re-
ceivers. The precoding sequence is chosed based on (3.19)
with m = 0 and τ = 0.7. Figure 4 shows that for differ-
ent number of symbol blocks, S, the NMSE decreases as
SNR increases. It also shows that the proposed method
can apply to the channels with more transmitters than
receivers.
Simulation 4 – Trade-off in selecting τ
In this simulation, we use the following channel
H(z) =
»
0.36 + 0.21j 0.48 + 0.29j
0.26 + 0.16j 0.5 + 0.17j

» −0.49− 0.36j 0.93 + 0.06j
0.88 + 1.30j 0.87 + 0.68j
–
z−1

0.73− 0.14j −0.13− 0.27j
0.29− 0.4j −0.44− 0.55j
–
z−2
(5.1)
to discuss the trade-off in selecting τ when channel equal-
ization is performed. We use the proposed method with
the optimal precoding sequences (3.19) with m = 0
for channel estimation. Then the frequency-domain ZF
equalizer is implemented based on the estimated channel.
Figure 5 shows the channel NMSE decreases as SNR in-
creases. It also shows that the estimation performs better
for smaller τ .
Figure 6(a) shows that for 0.20 ≤ τ ≤ 0.90, the bit er-
ror rate (BER) performance deteriorates as τ decreases;
and Figure 6(b) shows that for 0.90 ≤ τ ≤ 0.98, the BER
improves as τ decreases. Figure 6 shows that there is
a trade-off between estimation accuracy and noise am-
plification: For τ ∈ [0.20 0.90], although decreasing τ
brings good channel estimation accuracy and hence im-
proves the accuracy of Dzf , the noise is amplified by
G−1. The dominant factor of equalization performance
for τ ∈ [0.20 0.90] isG−1 rather than the accuracy ofDzf
(or the estimation accuracy). Hence BER increases as τ
decreases. On the other hand, for τ ∈ [0.90 0.98], the
dominant factor of equalization performance is the accu-
racy ofDzf (or the estimation accuracy) rather thanG−1.
Thus although decreasing τ causes an increase in noise, it
also brings good channel estimation accuracy and hence
improves the accuracy of Dzf , and so BER decreases as τ
decreases. From Figure 6, τ = 0.9 seems to be a compro-
mising optimal selection.
Simulation 5 – Comparison with the method in
[12]
In this simulation, we compare the estimation and
equalization performance of the proposed method with
that of another precoding method [12]. The precoding se-
quence is chosed based on (3.19) with τ = 0.5 for the pro-
posed method; while the precoding matrix for the method
in [12] is chosen as 1√
M
DdEj for j = 1, 2, 3, where Dd =
diag[
√
(M − 1)p+ 1, ,√1− p, · · · ,√1− p] ∈ RM×M is
a diagonal matrix with p = 0.5, and E1, E2, and E3 are
M ×M Hadamard matrix, normalized IDFT matrix, and
identity matrix, respectively. The channel model used in
this simulation is (5.1). In this simulation, we setM = 16
instead ofM = 18 such that the Hadamard matrix can be
defined. Figure 7 shows that the estimation and equaliza-
tion performance of the proposed method is better than

Abstract
We propose a blind channel estimation method for sin-
gle carrier block transmission systems with frequency do-
main equalization. The method uses periodic precoding
on the source signal before transmission. The estimation
of the channel impulse response vector consists of two
steps: (1) obtain the channel product matrix by solving
a group of decoupled linear equations, and (2) obtain the
channel impulse response vector by computing the max-
imal eigenvalue and the associated eigenvector of a Her-
mitian matrix formed from the channel product matrix.
The identiﬁability condition is very simple. The design
of the precoding sequence which minimizes the noise ef-
fect and numerical error in covariance matrix estimation
is proposed. Simulations are used to demonstrate the
performance of the method.

1 Introduction
Single carrier block transmission with frequency do-
main equalization (SC-FDE) is an important transmis-
sion system because it provides a low complexity equaliz-
tion process as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM), and it avoids some shortcomings of OFDM, e.g.
subcarrier frequency oﬀset [1, 2]. However, to exploit the
potential advantage of SC-FDE systems, accurate channel
state information is required. Channel can be identiﬁed or
estimated using training signal which requires additional
bandwidth. As a means to eschew the need of training
signal and the associated bandwidth requirement, blind
channel estimation becomes an attractive candidate.
In this paper, we propose a method for blind chan-
nel estimation of SC-FDE systems with periodic precod-

ing. By exploiting the linear relation between the covari-
ance matrix of the received data and the channel prod-
uct matrix, the channel product matrix can be solved by
a group of decoupled Toeplitz linear systems. Then we
compute the channel impulse response vector by taking
eigen-decomposition of a Hermitian matrix formed from
the channel product matrix. The proposed method leads
to a very simple identiﬁability condition. The design of
the precoding sequence which minimizes the noise eﬀect
and numerical error in covariance matrix estimation is
proposed. Simulations are used to demonstrate the per-
formance of the method.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is the
system model and problem statement. In Section 3, we
describe the estimation method, discuss the design of pre-
coding sequences, and propose an estimation algorithm.
Simulation results are given in Section 4. Section 5 con-
cludes this paper.
Notations used in this paper are quite standard: Bold
uppercase is used for matrices, and bold lowercase is used
for vectors. AT and A∗ denote the transpose and conju-
gate transpose of A, respectively. IM denotes the identity
matrix of dimension M × M . A(r1 : r2, c) is the vector
formed from the r1th row to the r2th row and from the
cth column of A. Γj(A) is the vector containing the en-
tries on the jth upper diagonal of A. The symbols R and
C stand for the set of real numbers and the set of complex
numbers, respectively.
2 System Model and Problem
Statement
Consider the discrete time SC-FDE baseband model
shown in Figure 2.1. At the transmitter, the input signal
v(n) is ﬁrst multiplied by a positive N -periodic sequence,
p(n) ∈ R, to obtain s(n) = p(n)v(n), where p(n + N) =
p(n), ∀ n. Then s(n) is passed through a serial-to-
parallel block whose output is s(i) = [s(iN) s(iN +

3.2 Optimal Design of the Precoding Se-
quence
When the white zero mean noise is present, the covari-
ance matrix of the received data becomes
R = E[x(i)x(i)∗] =
L∑
k=0
L∑
l=0
h(k)h(l)∗JkG2(JT )l + σ2wIN .
(3.5)
From (3.5), we see the noise has only contribution to the
diagonal entries of R. Therefore, the (L + 1) decoupled
groups of equations in (3.3) remain unchanged, except for
the j = 0 group, which becomes
Γ0(R) = M0f0 + σ2wb (3.6)
where b = Γ0(IN ) = [1 1 · · · 1]T ∈ RN . Thus from
(3.4), an approximate solution of f0 can be written by
f̂0 = (MT0 M0)
−1MT0 (M0f0 + σ

Γ0(R)
= f0 + σ2w(M
T
0 M0)
−1MT0 b = f0 + z,
(3.7)
which is f0 plus a perturbation term due to noise. We
know that if b is orthogonal to every column of M0, i.e.,
MT0 b = 0, then z = 0, which implies f̂0 = f0. But this
is impossible since the entries of M0 and z are positive.
Therefore, we seek to appropriately choose the precoding
sequence p(n) such that every column of M0 is as close
to being orthogonal to b as possible. From the deﬁnition
of Mj , we know M0 = [q0 q1 · · · qL]. It is easy to
check that qTk b assumes the same value,
∑N−1
n=0 p(n)
2, for
k = 0, 1, · · · , L. Then we only need to consider the re-
lation between columns q0 and b. Deﬁne the correlation
coeﬃcient
γ =
qT0 b
‖q0‖2‖b‖2 (3.8)
where ‖ · ‖2 is the 2-norm. Since γ is nonnegative and by
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1. In order to make
the perturbation term z small, we choose q0 so that the
correlation coeﬃcient γ is as small as possible. Based
on this point of view, we formulate the optimal selection
problem as minimizing γ subject to
|p(n)|2 ≥ τ > 0, ∀ 0 ≤ n ≤ L (3.9)
1
N
N−1∑
n=0
|p(n)|2 = 1 (3.10)
Roughly, constraint (3.9) requires that at each instant,
the power gain (|p(n)|2) is no less than τ with 0 < τ < 1;
constraint (3.10) normalizes the power gain of the precod-
ing sequence to 1. Note that the problem of selecting the
precoding sequence is identical to the case considered in
[4]. Thus the solution of the optimal precoding sequence
p(n) is a two-level sequence with a single peak in one
period [4]. More speciﬁcally, for each m, 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 1,
p(n) =
{ √
N(1− τ) + τ , n = m√
τ , n 
= m, 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1
(3.11)
is an optimal precoding sequence. Because the precoding
sequence is periodic with period N , the single peak can
be placed at any one of the N positions which yield the
same γ = 1√
N(1−τ)2+τ(2−τ) . Note that γ decreases as τ
decreases, which implies that the noise eﬀect in the es-
timation of covariance matrix R is minimized and thus
estimation performance improves. However the peak lo-
cation m does signiﬁcantly aﬀect the numerical condi-
tion of the linear equation (3.3). More precisely, diﬀerent
choices of m result in diﬀerent matrix Mj and aﬀect the
numerical computation of fj , j = 1, 2, · · · , L, in (3.4) and
fˆ0 in (3.7), since diﬀerent MTj Mj may have diﬀerent con-
dition number. If the condition number is large, then
the matrix MTj Mj is ill-conditioned and the computa-
tions in (3.4) and (3.7) are sensitive to data error. Let
μ = max0≤j≤L κ(MTj Mj), where κ(A) is the condition
number of A. From the results in [5, p. 906], we know
m = 0, or m = 1, ,· · · , or m = N − L − 1 will result in
the minimum condition number of μ. Hence the optimal
precoding sequence has a peak which locates at one of the
ﬁrst (N − L) positions.
3.3 Estimation algorithm
So far, we have proposed a new method for blind chan-
nel estimation of the SC-FDE transmission system us-
ing optimally designed periodic precoding sequences. By
properly choosing the precoding sequence, the channel
can be estimated up to a scalar ambiguity. The proposed
algorithm requires solving a group of decoupled linear
equations and computing the maximum eigenvalue and
the associated eigenvector of a Hermitian matrix. The
performance of the algorithm depends on the precoding
sequence which is optimally designed to reduce the eﬀects
of noise and numerical error in estimating the covariance
matrix of the received data. We summarize the proposed
method as the following algorithm.
Algorithm:
1) Select the optimal precoding sequence p(n) given by
(3.12) with a peak at m = 0, or m = 1, · · · , or
m = N − L − 1, and form Mj , j = 0, 1, · · · , L as in
(3.4).
2) Collect the received data as x(i) and estimate the
covariance matrix R via the time average: Rˆ =
