1. Introduction 
   The study to integrate photonic devices on a single chip has become growingly 
interesting in recent years. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) is an attractive material for 
high-density photonic integration circuits because of high refractive-index contrast 
between its silicon core and oxide cladding. SOI is also suitable to fabricate optical 
components and circuits using standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor 
(CMOS) technology. However, due to the high refractive-index contrast, there is a 
huge mismatch between the fundamental mode of SOI waveguide and the mode of 
optical fiber. This makes an effective optical coupling in and out of silicon photonic 
circuits is still a big challenge. A variety of trials have been proposed to tackle this 
coupling problem. Among these, the compact and high efficiency grating coupler is 
believed to be the most potential waveguide coupler [1]. Grating couplers have some 
main advantages: they could couple light anywhere on a chip, thus avoiding cleavage 
or facet polishing; they allow wafer-level optical testing and possible low-cost 
packaging, and they have large alignment tolerance, wide optical bandwidth, and high 
coupling efficiency. 
Some strategies have been proposed to improve the coupling efficiency of a SOI 
grating coupler. The optimization of grating period, filling factor (duty cycle), grating 
height or buried oxide (BOX) thickness of a grating coupler can match the profile of 
diffracted field and the mode of optical fiber and thus enhance coupling efficiency 
[2-5]. In addition, a cladding layer, an antireflection coating, or a sub-wavelength 
mirror on the grating, a bottom reflector [a metallic mirror or a distributed Bragg- 
reflector (DBR) type mirror] under the grating or a reflector grating side by coupling 
grating can redirect the diffracted light and improve the directionality of grating to 
obtain high coupling efficiency [3-8]. On the other hand, the use of non-uniform 
grating [5, 9], slanted grating [10], stratified waveguide grating [11], binary blazed 
grating [8], or linearly chirped grating [12] is able to optimize coupling efficiency as 
well. A high efficiency SOI grating coupler based on a poly-silicon (poly-Si) overlay 
or amorphous silicon (a-Si) overlay which is compatible with standard CMOS 
technology processing has been designed and realized [13-15]. The high efficiency 
grating coupler for silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguide [14] and the concept of Si3N4 
membrane photonics [15] have also been demonstrated because Si3N4 has many 
advantages over silicon, such as good diffusion barrier against water molecules and 
sodium ions, better transparency window at visible wavelength, good chemical

Gaussian beam and its beam waist is ωo, the theoretical optimal grating coupling 
length LC satisfies  
                             
the following equation 
1.37 coso CLω θ= .                      (5) 
   We use optical simulation software based on the finite-difference time domain 
(FDTD) technique for the grating coupler design. We place, 10 μm above the grating 
coupler, a single-mode fiber tilted 10o θ with respect to the y axis, i.e. =10o, to avoid 
the second order reflection at the waveguide grating. The diameter of the core 
(n~1.446) and the cladding (n~1.440) of the fiber is 8.2 μm and 125 μm, respectively, 
and the mode-field diameter is 10.4 μm. We launch an incident light (Pin) at 1.55 μm 
for TE polarization (transverse electric field, E-field parallel to the grating grooves) 
with normalized power one from the left end of the waveguide layer as shown in Fig. 
1. We then detect the amount of light diffracted upward (Pup) and the light coupled 
into the fiber (Pfiber), and further calculate the fiber coupling efficiency (η) in terms of 
η = Pfiber/Pin. The monitor with a size of 10.4 μm for detecting Pfiber is placed 125 μm 
away from the grating surface. Here we calculate the coupling efficiency from the 
waveguide to the fiber. The coupling efficiency from the fiber to the waveguide is the 
same, due to reciprocity principle [19]. We also scan the wavelength of incident light 
during simulation to realize the spectral response of diffraction light, the coupling 
efficiency and the 1dB bandwidth at the wavelength of 1.55 μm. Fig. 1 illustrates the 
directions of all optical fields. In Fig. 1, Pdown is the light diffracted downward and 
 6 
 
than 0.57 μm, Pup is diffracted to the right (left) side of the normal of the grating 
coupler surface. The intensity of Pup is the strongest for Λ = 0.7 μm. However, the 
directional angle of Pup is greater than 10o at this time, leading to coupling difficulties 
because of a large deviation from the desired angle, i.e. 10o. We thus assign 0.62 μm 
to the grating period after considering the intensity of Pup and the directional angle 
of 10o. The grating period determined here can achieve phase match between the 
gratings and guided mode with a single-order diffraction coupled into the top cladding 
layer [4]. 
Figure 3 shows the power up, power down, and reflection efficiencies as a 
function of the etch depth (eWG) of the waveguide layer for Λ= 0.62 μm, tovl = 0.26 μm, 
ff = 0.5, tclad = 0 μm, and tgap= 1.5 μm. The adjustment range of eWG lies in 0~0.18 μm. 
The dependence of the intensity of Pup on eWG is also found to be an M-shape 
distribution. The lower central point corresponds to the eWG value of 0.11μm. The 
direction of Pup is perpendicularly upward at this moment, causing a substantial 
increase of Preflect and thus a decrease of Pup. The direction of Pup moves gradually 
from the right side of the normal of the grating surface to the left side as eWG increases. 
When eWG is less (greater) than 0.11μm, Pup is diffracted to the right (left) side. Pup is 
the strongest and the direction of Pup and the amount of Preflect are within an 
acceptable range when eWG is 0.07μm. We therefore choose 0.07μm to be the value of 
eWG. The etch depth into the silicon waveguide layer apparently plays a very important 
role in increasing the power up efficiency. 
The power up, power down, and reflection efficiencies versus the overlay 
thickness (tovl) within the range of 0~ 0.45 μm for Λ= 0.62 μm, eWG = 0.07 μm, ff = 
0.5, tclad = 0 μm, and tgap= 1.5 μm is shown in Fig. 4. We find from the field pattern of 
simulation (not shown here) that the direction of Pup remains at around 10o and the 
coupling angle hardly changes. In addition, the intensity of Pup in Fig. 4 forms a 
single-peak distribution as tovl increases. Since the intensity of Pup is the strongest at 
tovl = 0.23 μm, we choose 0.23 μm as the thickness of Si3N4
From the results of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we find that the output coupling efficiency 
can be optimized through increasing the grating groove depth (
 overlay. 
eWG plus tovl) to achieve 
the maximum coupling intensity. This is probably because the change of grating 
groove depth can shape the output beam and the average neff of the guided 
transmission field in the weak disturbed grating region depends on the grating groove 
depth [2]. The grating groove depth we obtained here is 0.3 μm which means rather

reflects and then partially transmits at the upper film interface yielding wave 4. The 
phase difference between wave 1 and 4 caused by multiple interface reflections is zero. 
If the OPD (i.e., 2ntoptcladcosθ) between wave 1 and 4 is mλ where m is an integer, 
then wave 1 and 4 interfere constructively. The power up effieiency reaches its 
maximum. At this moment tclad is equal to mλ/(2ntopcosθ), namely a half-wavelength 
optical thickness. Top cladding layer can therefore increase the power up efficiency. 
The thickness of tclad is chosen to be 0.73 μm to direct more light upward to enhance 
the power up efficiency. By the way, we also find that the variation of tclad has little 
effect on the direction of Pup. The output coupling angle remains at approximately 10o
 
. 
Figure 7 shows the impact of the gap (tgap) between the silicon waveguide layer 
and the DBR on the power up, power down, and reflection efficiencies for Λ= 0.62 
μm, eWG = 0.07 μm, tovl = 0.23 μm, ff = 0.5, and tclad = 0.73 μm. We set the adjustment 
range of tgap to be 0.5~2.5 μm. It can be seen that power up efficiency shows a 
periodic behavior as a function of the gap thickness. This effect could be explained as 
follows: the grating creates upward and downward radiated waves. The downward 
radiated wave mostly reflects at the oxide/DBR interface and interferes with the 
directly upward radiated wave constructively or destructively [13, 16, 20-22]. If the 
phase difference of the two waves is 2kπ (k is an integer), constructive interference 
can occur and the power up efficiency achieves its maximum. If the phase difference 
is （2k+1）π, destructive interference will take place, the power up efficiency reaches 
its minimum [8]. For this reason, the gap between the waveguide and the bottom 
reflector has great influence on the power up efficiency. Depending on the gap 
thickness, the power up efficiency varies between 45% and 80%. As tgap is greater 
than or equal to 0.5 μm, the thickness of BOX layer is greater than or equal to 1.26 
μm (including the thickness of the two-pair DBR mirror), which is sufficiently thick 
to prevent leakage of light into the silicon substrate [3,16, 23]. Besides, Pup is the 
strongest when tgap is 0.9, 1.4 and 1.9 μm. The tgap is accordingly chosen as 1.4 μm. 
And what is more, the direction of Pup
 
 does not change with the gap thickness. The 
output coupling angle remains unchanged. 
As revealed by the results of Fig. 6 and 7, the impact of tclad on the max-min 
power up efficiency is about 10%, while the impact of tgap is ~35%. It is evident that 
tclad and tgap, especially tgap
                    
, influence greatly the power up efficiency. Meanwhile, as 
a result of an interference effect, the maximum power up efficiency could be 
periodically achieved as a function of the top cladding layer and the gap thickness:

A Si3N4 overlay at the top of the grating or a partially etched silicon waveguide 
can increase the vertical asymmetry of the grating structure, thereby increasing the 
grating directionality and coupling efficiency. For a vertically symmetric grating of 
which the silicon waveguide is completely etched through and the top and bottom 
cladding materials are identical, the radiated field is the same in the top and bottom 
cladding. The grating directionality which is defined as Pup/(Pup+Pdown) is therefore 
limited to ~50%. If we reduce the etch depth of the silicon waveguide or add a Si3N4 
overlay on the grating, we could increase the vertical asymmetry of the grating and 
optimize the grating directionality or coupling length. In this study, by applying a 
Si3N4
 
 overlay on the grating, we introduce an additional degree of freedom for the 
grating design so the radiated power toward the top cladding layer increases but the 
power toward the substrate decreases (see Fig. 4). Hence, the grating directionality is 
enhanced. 
The lateral alignment shift of about 2 μm in any direction will cause an additional 
coupling loss less than 1dB for the grating coupler proposed here. Further calculation 
for the fabrication and other alignment tolerances of the grating coupler is still under 
study. The study includes the reasonable tolerance of fabrication error by varying etch 
depths and groove widths of the grating, the effect of a slight change of θ  on the 
central wavelength of the spectral response of the coupler, or the influence of the 
distance between the optical fiber end facet and the grating coupler on the coupling 
loss. All these results will be published elsewhere later. 
 
The fiber coupling efficiency in this work could be further improved. For example, 
the utilization of a simple genetic algorithm [4] or an iterative numerical method [24] 
could further optimize the design of a grating coupler. The application of a chirped 
grating or a non-uniform grating [5, 9, 22] could also enhance the fiber coupling 
efficiency. By changing the grating filling factor configuration, the grating coupler 
would act as a focusing lens [9] and the output beam could be shaped as well [5] so 
that the radiated field profile and the Gaussian optical fiber mode would achieve a 
better match to increase the fiber coupling efficiency [22]. Furthermore, the 
apodization of a grating by varying its groove widths and etch depths would enable a 
good overlap between the radiated field and the Gaussian-like fiber mode, too [21, 25]. 
As a result, a higher fiber coupling efficiency would be realized.

Figure 1(d) presents SH signals of poled bare fused silica and P-doped SiO2 planar waveguide as a function of the 
poling voltage for thermal poling at 275 °C for 60 min. As the poling voltage increases, SH signals of poled P-
doped SiO2 planar waveguide continuously increase parabolically but signals of poled bare fused silica increase 
first and then tend to saturation. Compared with SH signals of poled bare fused silica, poled P-doped SiO2 planar 
waveguide always shows stronger signals under various poling voltages. 
 
The SON of thermally poled fused silica is mainly correlated with the interaction between a strong space-charge 
electric field and the third-order susceptibilityχ(3) of silica glasses. During the poling treatment, charge transport of 
mobile ions (e.g. Na+) in silica glasses leads to a strong space-charge electric field within several micrometers 
beneath the anode surface. The detailed discussion of these characteristics can refer to Chen et al. (2003). Since no 
sodium ion sources exist in the P-doped SiO2 films prepared by PECVD, terminal [ 23 -PO ] groups or isolated [ 34PO − ] 
entities of the phosphate chains are probably related to be the origin of SON of the P-doped planar waveguides. 
This may explain why P-doped SiO2 planar waveguides possess lower/shorter threshold value of poling 
temperature/ duration. By means of hydrofluoric acid etching, Maker’s fringe measurement and grid search curve 
fitting using a double-step nonlinear profile, we obtained that a second-order nonlinear susceptibility of around 
0.58 pm/V was induced in the waveguide poled  at 5 kV and 275 oC for 60 min (Chen and Lin (2009)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
The SH signals of poled P-doped SiO2 planar waveguides are all stronger than those of poled bare fused silica 
under different poling conditions. P-doped SiO2 planar waveguides have lower/shorter threshold value of poling 
temperature/duration compared with bare fused silica. A nonlinear P-doped SiO2 planar waveguide was 
implemented in this study.
