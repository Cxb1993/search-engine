Abstract 
Universal Generating Function Technique (UGFM) has already been exploited in simple system 
reliabilities (e.g. AMIN) successively after being proposed in 1980. UGFM is simple and easy to use. It 
enumerates all possible states, and then solves the problem in a recursive way effectively and 
systematically. It is similar to a master key with full potential to solve more common and important 
problems. However, the advantage of UGFM has not been completely utilized yet. Hence, we aim to 
improve, strengthen, and popularize UGFM as follows. 
The 1st year: Improve UGFM to solve the reliability of WVS, ABAN and AMAN, separately. I had 
already simplified UGFM to solve AMIN reliability in an accepted SCI journal paper. These 
experiences are used to help further improve the UGFM and expand this technology to the flow network 
to solve the reliabilities of WVS, ABAN and AMAN, separately. 
The 2nd year: Strengthen UGFM to calculate the reliability of MNN, BAN and MIN, individually. The 
main purpose of this year is to strengthen and perfect the functions and structure of UGFM. After that, 
the novel UGFM can calculate the reliability of any kind of networks including MAN and MIN to 
enhance the applications of UGF.

coefficient v-1K is a MTP which is the probability that the signal can reach state I from node 1 via Gi. 
To obtain the subnetwork-UGF U(i), a recursive expression and the multiplcation operator  are 
introduced as follows:

The composition operator  is very similar to the union operator and has higher precedence than , i.e., 
ABC=(AB)C. It plays a central role in UGFMs and satisfies the commutative rule and the 
associated law: AB=BA and A(BC)=(AB)(AC), where A, B, and C are either node-UGFs or 
states of UGFs. The MIN reliability from node 1 to the non-empty target subset J is given by 
RJ= I
I T
J I
r

 , 
where rJ the probability of all nodes in J (T) receiving a signal directly from node 1 and all nodes in 
TJ receiving no signal directly from node 1. 
In the subnet-UGF, each state presents an MP-candidate which is a subset of an MP. In traditional 
UGFMs, all states must be correct and completely included in the subnet-UGF using U(i)=U(i1)u(i). 
This is assured by the fact that the sequence of finding the subnet-UGFs must follow the same order of 
the node labels, i.e., U(1), U(2), …, U(n). From Graph Theory, this special order of the node labels 
always exists in acyclic networks, as shown below: 
The nodes in an acyclic network can be topologically numbered in such a way that for any 
edge euvE with u<v. 
The definition and search of all states constitute the core of UGFMs. The formulation and 
modeling of states vary if the problem is different. The following is the generic UGFM for finding all 
one-to-all-target-subset symbolic reliability functions in AMINs. 
STEP 0. Find u(1), let U(1)=u(1), i=2, and construct u(i) for i=2,3,…,t. 
STEP 1. Calculate and simplify U(i)=U(i1)u(i). 
STEP 2. If i<t, let i=i+1 and go to STEP 1. 
STEP 3. Let rI=|VT|,I for all non-empty target subset I, and rT=RT. 
STEP 4. Let RJ= I

To the author’s best knowledge, the first UGFM for the AMIN reliability problem was proposed 
by Levitin [19], and has recently been improved by Yeh using some simple techniques [21-24]. Owing 
to the natural characteristic of #P-hard problems, the number terms obtained in symbolic reliability 
functions are exponential in size, and thus the results are superfluous and very complicated to be 
applicable in practice. 
Therefore, the main and purpose of this project is listed as follows as shown in their titles:  
A. The k-out-of-n Acyclic Multistate-Node Networks Reliability Evaluation Using the Universal 
Generating Function Method (Reliability Engineering & System Safety, Vol. 91, No. 7, 2006/7, pp. 
800-808)

must receive at least a certain amount of flows from its input edges. On the contrary, the k-out-of-n 
node will fail if it receives more than a certain amount of flows. It exists in many real-life situations, 
and it was newly introduced in this article. 
For the one-to-one (between the source node and only one target subset) reliability of the MNN 
including k+-out-of-n nodes, the best-known algorithm (a modified version of the method proposed in 
Yeh [7]) was proposed by Yeh based on some intuitive theorems that characterize the structure of the 
minimal cut (MC) without containing duplicated MCs [9]. To the author’s best knowledge, the AMNN 
was first investigated by Malinowski and Preuss [10]. For the one-to-all (between the source node and 
all target subsets) AMNN reliability evaluation, the best-known algorithm was proposed by Levitin 
using the universal generating function (UGFM, or the universal z-transform) [11]. However, many of 
the steps used in his method take an extra exponential time to simplify the terms obtained using a 
multiplication-similar operation of two UGFs and to collect the like terms in each iteration [11]. Yeh is 
the first one to show that each MNN reliability can be solved using any of the traditional binary-state 
networks reliability algorithm with a special code for the state probability [13]. Yeh also proposed the 
best-known algorithm based on MCs for the one-to-one AMNN reliability evaluation [14]. 
The proposed k-out-of-n AMNN is more practical and reasonable than MAN and MNN. In real-life 
cases, many networks such as computer and telecommunications include k+-out-of-n nodes for 
redundancy and k-out-of-n nodes for overload prevention. Thus, the need for an efficient and intuitive 
method to evaluate this novel network reliability thus arises. The purpose of this study is to present a 
novel network called the k-out-of-n AMNN (combining AMNN and k-out-of-n nodes), and to 
investigate a simple UGFM to evaluate one-to-all k-out-of-n AMNN reliability.

Notations: 
||: the number of elements in .  
Pr(): the probability of . 
k+(): the non-negative integer parameter indicates the minimum input flows required to 
activate node . 
k(): another non-negative integer parameter indicates the maximum flow allowed to pass 
through node . If k+()=1, k+()>1, or k+()=0, then  is a non-k-out-of-n node, 
k+-out-of-n node, and k-out-of-n node, respectively. 
G(V, E, k): a k-out-of-n AMNN with the node set V={1,2,…, n}, the edge set E, the integer

such a way that for any edge euvE with u<v [11-14]. For example [15], Figure 1 is a 
k-out-of-n AMNN of radio relay stations with a transmitter located at the root position, 
i.e. node 1, and receivers allocated in the terminal positions (i.e. nodes 4 and 5). Each 
intermediate station (i.e. nodes 2 and 3) has re-transmitters generating signals that 
reaches a set of next stations. If at least one intermediate station, say node 3, needs 
more than two signals to generate a signal to reach a set of next stations, then we have 
k+(3)1.

{2,3}. 
Assumptions 
The k-out-of-n AMNN satisfies the following assumptions: 
1. Each node is perfectly reliable, can be enabled to generate a flow except the target node set, and 
at least one node is a k-out-of-n node. 
2. Each edge has two states: working or failed. 
3. The signal can be retransmitted without following the flow conservation law. 
4. All of these probabilities of states of each non-sink node are according to a given distribution 
and assumed to be statistically independent. 
5. No maintenance is considered. 
A3. PRELIMINARIES 
The proposed algorithm improves the best-known algorithm for the one-to-all AMNN reliability 
evaluation proposed in [11] on simplifying and collecting the terms obtained in each iteration. It is 
based on the universal generating function method (UGFM) [15], which was introduced in [15] and was 
proven to be very effective for high dimension combinatorial problems [11]. The detailed description of 
UGFM applied to system availability estimation is presented in [11,15]. A brief introduction to this 
technique is given here after the following property which described the relationships between v and 
v, pv-1,v} and v-1,v}, respectively: 
Property 1: The following statements are true: 
1. 1=1. 
2. vv and each element in v is a subset of VVv. 
3. If wv, then {w}W for all Wv. 
 
There are two types of UGF: one is for the node and the other is for the sub-network. The UGF of 
node v is defined as a polynomial function of z: 
u(v)=
 vJ
J
vJ zp , (1) 
where 
 vJ
vJp =1, J is the set of nodes emanating from the node v, and pvJ is the probability that the 
node v can emit and send a signal to J. Let the UGF of the sub-network G(Vv,Ev,k) be 
U(v)= K
K




where vT, for all K is a possible state that the signal can reach after via G(Vv-1,Ev-1,k) and v-1K is 
probability that the signal can reach state K after via G(Vv-1,Ev-1,k). It is trivial that the following 
relationships related to u() and/or U(v) are true. 
Property 2: The following statements are true: 
1. u(1)=U(1).  (3) 
2. If evwE, then the terms pv,{w}z{w} and v,w}z{w} always in u(v) and U(v), respectively. 
3. The terms w.r.t. z{v} are not in the final result of U(v).

From Property 5, Eq.(15) can be simplified furthermore as follows: 
(p1,{2}p2,z

{3})+p1,{3}z
{3}=p1,{2}p2,{3}z

The following corollary is the base to simplify the result of U(v1)u(v). Its correctness comes 
directly from Corollaries 1 and 2. It combines Corollaries 1 and 2, and is merged in the procedure to 
find and simplify the result of U(v1)u(v) simultaneously.

The following discusses how to collect like terms efficiently during the procedure of calculation for 
U(v1)u(v) for all non-target node v. 
Property 7: If vK, KL, and Lv, then the following term is included in U(v1)u(v):

Property 8: If vK, Kv1, and M=KL{v}v for all Lv, then the following term is included in 
U(v1)u(v):

Corollary 4: If vK, Kv1, and the coefficient of zK{v} in U(v1)u(v) due to pv is

The next theorem is an extension of Properties 7 and 8. It is more efficient than the best-known 
algorithm for AMNN on simplifying U(v1)u(v). 
Theorem 1: If vI for all Iv-1, M=KL{v}v for all {v}Kv1 and Lv, then

The following two properties are also implemented in the proposed UGFM to remove the 
redundant terms w.r.t. k-out-of-n nodes for calculating each U(v) for all v|VT|. 
Property 9: If k(j)=, K= 11,Iip 22 ,Iip …  Iip , , j, and   ,...,2,1 ),( Ij > for all Irr then KzK is

theorem. 
Theorem 4: The above UGFM finds the one-to-all reliability for the k-out-of-n AMNN with a 
complexity of O(2
2|E||T|
). 
 
From Theorem 4, the number of terms obtained from each iteration in calculating U(v) increases 
exponentially. Hence, the total running time can be reduced dramatically if Properties 9 and 10 are 
implement to remove the redundant terms. 
A5. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE 
As in the two existing best-known methods [11,14], the evaluation of MAN reliability possesses a 
computational difficulty that, in the worse case, grows exponentially with the network size. Therefore, 
the suggested method can be applied for moderately sized networks. Owing to this inherent problem, 
instead of presenting practically large network systems, a moderate size network shown in Figure 1 
which is adapted from [11,14] is selected to demonstrate this methodology.  
Example 1: Consider the network presented in Figure 1 in Section 2, where k+(1)=k+(2)=k+(4)=k+(5)=1. 
The proposed algorithm is used to find the R{4,5}, R{4}, and R{5} for the following three 
different cases: 
(1) k(3)=1, 
(2) k(3)=1,  
(3) k(3)=2. 
Solution for the Case 1:  
STEP 0. Set up all universal generating functions for each non-sink nodes as follows: 
u(1) =p1,z
+p1,{2}z
{2}+p1,{3}z
{3}+p1,{2,3}z
{2,3} (31) 
 =p1,{2}z
{2}+p1,{3}z
{3}+p1,{2,3}z
{2,3} (32) 
u(2) =p2,z
+p2,{3}z
{3}+p2,{5}z
{5}+p2,{3,5}z
{3,5} (33) 
u(3) =p3,z
+p3,{4}z
{4}. (34) 
STEP 1. Let v=2, and 
U(1) =u(1) (35) 
 =p1,{2}z
{2}+p1,{3}z
{3}+p1,{2,3}z
{2,3}. (36) 
STEP 2. Implement Theorem 1 to calculate and simplify U(2)=U(v1)u(v)=U(1)u(2) as follows: 
U(2) =U(1)u(2) (37) 
 =(p1,{2}z
{2}+p1,{3}z
{3}+p1,{2,3}z
{2,3})(p2,z+p2,{3}z{3}+p2,{5}z{5}+p2,{3,5}z{3,5}) (38) 
 =p1,{3}z
{3}+[p1,{2}z
{2}+p1,{2,3}z
{2,3}][p2,z+p2,{3}z{3}+p2,{5}z{5}+p2,{3,5}z{3,5}] (39) 
 2,{3}z{3}+2,{5}z{5}+2,{3,5}z{3,5} (40) 
 where 
2,{3} =p1,{3}+[p1,{2,3}p2,+p1,{2,3}p2,{3}+p1,{2}p2,{3}] (41) 
2,{5} =p1,{2}p2,{5} (42) 
2,{3,5} =[p1,{2,3}p2,{5}+p1,{2,3}p2,{3,5}+p1,{2}p2,{3,5}]. (43) 
STEP 3. Since Case 1 is not a k-out-of-n AMNN , go to STEP 4. 
STEP 4. Since v=2<|VT|=3, let v=v+1=3 and go to STEP 2. 
STEP 2. Implement Theorem 1 to calculate and simplify U(3)=U(v1)u(v)=U(3)u(4) as follows: 
U(3) =U(2)u(3) (44) 
 2,{3}z{3}+2,{5}z{5}+2,{3,5}z{3,5}[p3,z+p3,{4}z{4}] (45) 
 2,{5}z{5}+2,{3}z{3}+2,{3,5}z{3,5}[p3,z+p3,{4}z{4}] (46) 
 3,{4}z{4}+3,{5}z{5}+3,{4,5}z{4,5} (47) 
 where 
3,{4} =2,{3}p3,{4} (48) 
 =[p1,{3}+(p1,{2,3}p2,+p1,{2,3}p2,{3}+p1,{2}p2,{3})]p3,{4} (49) 
 13
Properties 9 and 10. 
A6. CONCLUSIONS 
A new node called the k-out-of-n node which can not receive more than a certain amount of flows; 
i.e. its function is in total contrast to the k+-out-of-n node, is introduced in this article. A novel network 
called the k-out-of-n AMNN is then presented in this article. It extends AMNN by combining AMNN, 
k+-out-of-n nodes and k-out-of-n nodes. An UGFM based algorithm for finding one-to-all k-out-of-n 
AMNN reliability was developed. The proposed algorithm does not need to take extra time to remove 
redundant terms and collect like terms in each UGF. Hence, it is also more efficient than the best-know 
UGFM proposed in [11] for the one-to-all k-out-of-n AMNN reliability problem.

B. A Simple Universal Generating Function Method for Estimating General Multistate-Node 
Networks Reliability 
 
Abstract  Many real-world systems (such as cellular telephones, transportation, etc.) are multistate-node 
network (MNN) composed of multistate-nodes with different states determined by a set of nodes receiving 
the signal directly from these nodes without satisfying the conservation law. Current methods for 
evaluating the MNN reliability all derived from the universal generating function methods (UGFMs). 
Unfortunately, UGFMs are only effective for special MNNs without any cycle, i.e. acyclic MNNs 
(AMNNs). A very simple revised universal generating function method is developed for the general MNN 
reliability problem. The proposed UGFM allows cycles with the same time complexity as the best-known 
UGFM. The correctness and computational complexity of the proposed UGFM will be analyzed and 
proven. One example is given to illustrate how MNN reliability is evaluated using the proposed UGFM.  
Key Words  Reliability, Multistate-node, Acyclic Network, Universal Generating Function 
B1. Introduction 
Ever since the initial development of reliability engineering, network reliability has been one of the 
main subjects of research. The network reliability theory has been applied extensively in many real-world 
systems such as computer and communication systems, power transmission and distribution systems, 
transportation systems, oil/gas production systems, computer networks, cellular telephone networks, etc. 
The evaluation of the network reliability is a NP-hard problem (Colbourn, 1987;Shier, 1991). 
Reliability evaluation approaches exploit a variety of tools for system modeling and reliability index 
calculation. The network reliability, defined as the probability of connection of the source node with targets 
(i.e. target nodes). According to how the method used to transfer the flow (or signal) satisfies the flow 
conservation law, there are two categories of network reliability problems: the multistate-arc network 
(MAN) (Lin, 2004, 2006; Nahman, 1997; Shen, 1995; Soh, 2005; Sohn, 2005; Yeh, 2005) and the 
multistate-node network (MNN) (Levitin, 2001, 2005; Lisnianski & Levitin, 2003; Malinowski & Preuss, 
1996; Yeh, 2003a, 2006a). In MAN, each arc has a non-negative integer-valued random variable capacity 
(multistate-arc) and all flows in the network obey the conservation law. Conversely, all nodes in the MNN 
violate the conservation law. It has a source node (position) where the signal source is located, a number of 
sink nodes that only receive the signal, and a number of intermediate nodes that retransmit the received 
signal to some other nodes. The non-sink node has different states determined by a set of nodes receiving 
the signal directly from it. Both have their own applications, for example electrical power distribution can 
be modeled as MAN, and computer networks or cellular telephone networks be modeled as MNN (Levitin, 
 19
|| : the number of elements in .  
G(V, E) : a connected network free of self-loops and with the set of nodes V={1, 2, 3,…, n}, the 
set of arcs E, and the source node 1 which is the only node can emanate signal but cannot 
receive any signal, e.g. the network in Figure 1 is an acyclic network.

Figure 3. Three complete MTPs: p1:23p3:4p2:3, p1:23p3:4p2:5 and p1:23p3:4p2:. 
Sub-MTP: a part of MTP. For example, p1:23p3:4 is a sub-MTP of MTPs p1:23p3:4p2:3 (see Figure 
3a), p1:23p3:4p2:5 (see Figure 3b) and p1:23p3:4p2: (see Figure 3c). Note that there is a 
one-to-one relationship between MTP and MT, but a sub-MTP may be included in 
more than one MTP. 
Individual UGF:  the UGF for the basic element of UGFMs. 
Group-UGF: the UGF formed by individual UGFs. 
The multiplication operator: the operator to unify individual UGFs with group-UGFs. 
the flow conservation law: the total flow (signal) through into and from a node (not a source node, target 
nodes, or a target node) are all equal. 
AMNN: a special acyclic MNN which is a generalization of the tree-structured multi-state 
system, each node in AMNN has different states determined by a set of nodes that 
receive the signal directly without satisfying the conservation law (Yeh, 2003a;Yeh, 
2006a). 
Term: the individual product in the UGF, e.g. p1:z
, p1:2z
2, p1:3z
3 and p1:23z
23 are terms in 
U(1)=u(1)=p1:z
+p1:2z
2+p1:3z
3+p1:23z
23. 
one-to-all-targets: between the source node and all target subsets. 
Assumptions 
The MNN satisfies the following assumptions: 
1. Each arc is perfectly reliable. 
2. The signal can be retransmitted without following the flow conservation law. 
3. All of these state probabilities for each non-sink node are random variables according to a given 
distribution and assumed to be statistically independent. 
4. The network is connected and free of self-loops.

The multiplcation operator  is very similar to the multiplication except the exponent part of the z. It 
plays a central role in UGFMs. It also satisfies the commutate rule and associated law. 
Property 2: AB=BA, and (A+B)C=AC+BC, where A, B, C are either a UGFs or terms of 
UGFs (e.g. pi:Iz
I and/or i:IzI). 
 
After locating U(|V-T|), the coefficients of zJ, i.e. V-T:J, are determined for all non-empty target subsets 
J. The last step is to calculate the exact reliability between node 1 and each non-empty target subset in 
terms of V-T:J. The next property discusses the relationships between , r, and R. 
 25
The following four properties are true for both AMNN and MNN reliabilities, and they are all obtained 
from Eq.(6) and the definition of UGFs.

To reduce the number of terms in UGFs, i.e. the number of all possible MTPs, it is better to collect like 
terms and remove redundant terms after creating each U(i). The following property is implemented in the 
best-known UGFM to reduce redundant terms (Yeh, 2006b). 
Property 7: If IVi-1, then pi:IzIU(i1)=pi:IzI in AMNNs. 
For example, Eqs.(11) and (12) can be simplified before calculating using Property 7:

It is a time-consuming and burdensome job to calculate U(v) using Eq. (6) only. The next theorem is 
proposed in the best-known UFGM with simplification techniques developed from the collection of like 
terms (e.g. Property 7) to find and simplify the result of U(v1)u(v) efficiently and simultaneously. 
Theorem 2: If vI for all Iv-1, M=KL{v}v for all {v}Kv1 and Lv, then

pk:. The original pk: is the probability that the signal flows into but stops at node k. To help obtain all 
possible sub-MTPs, pk: is set to 1 in the following special situation in the proposed UGFM:

For example, p1:3p2:p3:4=p1:3p3:4 since there is a complete MT w.r.t. p1:3p3:4 in Figure 4. The following 
theorem shows that all sub-MTPs are found in the subnetwork-UGF after revising the definition of pk: in 
Property 9 and using Property 8 without the topological numbering. 
Theorem 3: All sub-MTPs in G[i] are included in U([i])=U([i1])u([i]). 
Proof: It is trivial that this theorem is true for i=2. Assume that it is also true for [i]=[j1]. If [i]=[j] 
and all sub-MTPs in G[j] are included in U([j])=U([j1])u([j]), then the proof is complete. 
Let =
[ ][ ]: [ ]:
[ ]
kj J k I
k
p p , for all [k]{1,[2],…,[i1]}. If ()G[j] but U([j]), then 
[ ][ ]:
[ ]
kk I
k
p U([j1]), i.e. ( [ ][ ]:
[ ]
kk I
k
p ) is not a sub-MTP in G[j-1]. It is contradicted to the 
topological numbering that theorem is true for i=j1. Hence, U([j]). The theorem is hold 
by the induction.    
Corollary 1: If U([i]), then =
1 [ 2] [ ]1: [2]: [ ]: iI I i I
p p p , i.e. one and only one [k] in the 1st subscribe for all 
[k]=1,[2],…,[i]. 
Corollary 2: Each MTP and its sub-MTPs are obtained in U([V-T]). 
The following corollary guarantees that a newly created MTP w.r.t. a new subnetwork-UGF, say U([i]), 
is the product of multiplying some sub-MTPs with part of u([i]). 
Corollary 3: If 
[ ][ ]: [ ]:
[ ]
ki I k I
k
p p  is a MTP created in U([i]), then [ ][ ]:
[ ]
kk I
k
p  is a sub-MTP in U([i1]). 
The MTP is a special way to represent a MT, and a sub-MT is a subset of a MT by removing some arcs 
or nodes from this MT. Hence, we have the following property immediately. 
Corollary 4: Let m be a sub-MT of MT M. If there is a MTP corresponding to M, then there is also a 
sub-MTP corresponding to m. 
The three major modifications can find all possible sub-MTPs. However, the number of all possible 
non-MTPs grows exponentially in size of MTPs. To reduce considerably the computational burden, we 
usually collect like terms and delete redundant terms after obtaining each new subnetwork-UGF. Some

The detailed of algorithm of the proposed UGFM is described as follows 
STEP 0. Let i=2 and U([1])=u(1)=

STEP 2. Calculate and simplify (including collect like terms) U([i])=U([i1])u([i]). 
STEP 3. If i<|VT|, then let i=i+1 and go to STEP 1. 
STEP 4. Let rJ=v:J for all JT. 
STEP 5. Calculate RJ=
JI
Ir  which is the MNN reliability from node 1 to node set J. 
Basically, the proposed UGFM is a complete examination of all possible states of each node, which 
implies its correctness. The major time complexity of the above proposed UGFM is induced from STEP 2. 
The number of states in u(v) is O(2deg(v)). The total degree of all nodes is discussed in the following 
theorem. 
Theorem 4: (the First Theorem Graph Theory) 

Vv
vdeg )( =2|E|. (28) 
The proposed UGFM is based on Theorems 1-4 and Properties 8-12. Thus, the correctness and the time 
complexity of the above the proposed UGFM are given in the following theorem. 
Theorem 5: The above UGFM finds the one-to-all-targets MNN reliability with a complexity of 
O(2
2|E||T|
). 
The proposed algorithm not only can solve the MMN reliability problem, but also can be applied to 
calculate the AMMN reliability simply by letting i=[i]. Moreover, the time complexity of the proposed 
UGFM is as the same as that of the best-known UGFM which works only for AMNNs (Yeh, 2006a). Hence, 
the proposed UGFM is more effective than the best-known UGFM. 
The difficulty with modeling network reliability is due to the size of the network. The matter becomes 
worse when there are multi-states in the networks. Indeed, an MAN (satisfying the flow-conservation law) 
with small number of nodes but very large number of states is quite difficult to solve when compared with 
an MAN with large number of nodes but small number of multi-states (Lin 2004; Nahman, 1997; Soh, 
2005; Sohn, 2005; Yeh, 2005). However, it seems that the above situation is not occurs in the MNN which 
is not satisfied the flow conservation from the Theorem 5.

B7. Conclusions and Future Works 
The UGFM had been proved to be very efficient in evaluating the one-to-all-targets AMNN reliability 
which is a special MNN without any cycle. However, cycles are very common in networks. A new UGFM 
is introduced in this article to overcome this serious obstacle. It modified the existing known UGFMs to 
evaluate the one-to-all-targets MNN reliability with the same time complexity of the best-known UGFM

The AMNDCS is a special case of MSN. According to [26], the methods of MSN reliability 
assessment involve four different approaches: the UGFM, the Monte-Carlo simulation, the extension of the 
Boolean models to the multi-valued case, and the stochastic process approach. Compared with other 
methods, the UGFM involves intuitively simple, straightforward, and universal recursive procedures 
combined with simplification techniques. The UGFM was introduced in Ref. [22] and was proven to be 
very effective for evaluating different types of one-to-all AMSN reliability (neglecting cost and/or capacity 
constraints) without requiring great computational effort [22-26,30]. To the author’s best knowledge, the 
first UGFM for the AMSN reliability problem was proposed by Levitin [25], and has recently been 
improved by Yeh using some simple techniques [30]. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to 
present a new approach using Yeh’s UGFM to solve the proposed problem.

7. The signal can be retransmitted without following the flow conservation law. 
8. All of these probabilities of states of each non-sink node are random variables according to a given 
distribution and assumed to be statistically independent. 
C3. Introduction to UGFM 
Before introducing the proposed UGFM, a brief introduction to the original UGFM with some useful 
properties is given here. Further developments and applications of UGFMs were presented in [22-26,30] 
and one can find detailed description in [23,24] that summarized recent achievements in the field of 
network reliability estimation. There are two types of UGFs in the traditional UGFM: one is for the 
individual UGF (called the node-UGF here) and the other one is the group UGF (called the subnet-UGF). 
Both kinds of UGFs record all their own possible states. The node-UGF is defined as a polynomial function 
of z: 
u(i)= :

{5}+p1:{2,3}p2:{3,5}z
{3,5} (12) 
To assure that all states are correct and completely included in the subnet-UGF, and to guarantee 
U(i)=U(i1)u(i), the sequence of finding the subnet-UGFs must follow the same order of the node labeled 
in the existing UGFMs, i.e. U(1), U(2), …, U(|VT|), for all UGFMs. From the Graph Theory, this special 
order of the node labels always exists as shown below. 
Theorem 1: The nodes in an acyclic network can be topologically numbered such that u<v if euvE [5]. 
 
Much of the development in existing-known UGFMs has relied on a simple but powerful idea. To 
generate an expanding sequence of states (coefficients) of the subnet-UGFs, we iteratively extend states 
along the sequence of node labels. Since the number of the AMNDCS states grows exponentially with the 
number of its elements, the number of all possible coefficients in subnet-UGFs increases very rapidly with 
the increase in size of degrees. Hence, the computation is tedious and time consuming. To reduce 
considerably computational complexity and burden, we usually collect like terms and delete redundant 
terms after obtaining each new subnet-UGF. Hence, 
U(2) =2,z+2,{3}z{3}+2,{5}z{5}+2,{3,5}z{3,5} (13) 
where 
2, =p1:{2}p2: (14) 
2,{3} =p1:{2}p2:{3}+p1:{3}p2+p1:{3}p2:{3}+p1:{2,3}p2+p1:{2,3}p2:{3} (15) 
2,{5} =p1:{2}p2:{5}+p1:{3}p2:{5}+p1:{2,3}p2:{5} (16) 
2,{3,5} =p1:{2}p2:{3,5}+p1:{3}p2:{3,5}+p1:{2,3}p2:{3,5} (17) 
The multiplication operator  is very similar to the multiplication process except for the exponent part 
of z. It plays a central role in UGFMs, and also satisfies both the commutate rule and associated law. 
Property 2: AB=BA, and (A+B)C=AC+BC, where A, B, C are either a UGF or terms of UGFs 
(e.g. pi:Iz
I and/or i,IzI).

From Theorem 1, Eq.(19) maintains a feasible states at each subnet-UGF. In addition, Eq.(19) specifies 
that each term in U(i) is composed of exactly one term in u(i) and at most one term in U(i1), i.e. each 
coefficient in U(i) is obtained from exactly one coefficient in u(i) and at most an old coefficient in U(i1). 
We have thus established the following results. 
Property 6: If : kk I
k
p    zKU(i), then K= ( { })kk I k , where for all kVi-1 (i.e. k<i). 
Property 7: pi:Ii-1,JzKU(i) if and only if i-1,JzJU(i1) and pi:IzIu(i), where Ii, Ji-1, and 
K=JI{i}. 
Corollary 1: : : ki I k I

J= ( { })k
k
I k , K=JI{i}, and for all kVi-1. 
Property 8: pi:IzI is an impendent term in both U(i) and u(i) if and only if JI= for all i-1,JzJU(i1). 
 
From the above discussion, we ensure that the basic equation U(i)=U(i1)u(i) is still held after 
redefining . Thus, the combinations of the above discussion ascertained the following theorem.  
Theorem 2: U(i)=U(i1)u(i) while  is defined using the new designation listed in Eq.(19). 
C5. The Proposed UGFM 
In this section we establish the proposed UGFM for finding all one-to-many reliabilities under the cost 
and capacity constraints between the source node 1 and the non-empty target subsets in AMNDCS by 
revising the existing known UGFM proposed in [30]. The UGFM is a problem-oriented, systematical, 
flexible, and universal methodology. Its formulation and model is different if the problem is different. From

According to the multiplication operator, the subnet-UGF U(i1) is enlarged to U(i) by unifying the 
node-UGF u(i). The original recursive expression is also changed simultaneously with the new definition of 
multiplication operator  introduced in Eqs.(34) and (35).  
Corollary 2: If : ( )k K k
k

Corollary 3: If : ( )k K k

p    zJ,C′,D′U(|VT|), then J= ( ( ) { })k K k k , C’<c*, D’>d*, and k<|VT|. 
Corollary 4: pi:IzI,C(I),M(I) is an independent term in both U(i) and u(i) if and only if JI= for all 
i-1,JzJU(i1). 
 
Basically, each individual term in subnet-UGF U(i), is a state indicating how the signal flows from 
node 1 to node subset i. It also represents the probability of a directed acyclic network connected to the 
 45
and the total degree of all nodes is discussed in the following theorem. 
Theorem 4: (the First Theorem Graph Theory) 


vdeg )( =2|E|. (36) 
 
Thus, the correctness and the time complexity of the above proposed UGFM are established in the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 5: The above UGFM finds all one-to-many AMNDCS reliabilities with a complexity of 
O(2
2|E||T|
). 
C7. An Illustrative Example 
The general procedure is best illustrated with an example. The difficulty with modeling the AMNDCS 
reliability is attributed to the size of the network. The matter becomes worse when there are multi-states in 
the networks. Owing to this inherent problem, instead of presenting practically large network systems, a 
benchmark network shown in Figure 1 adapted from the most frequently cited example proposed in [24-30] 
is selected to demonstrate this methodology as in all the existing algorithms. 
Consider the AMNDCS presented in Figure 1 of Section 2, where node 1 is the source node, and nodes 
4 and 5 are the target nodes, i.e. the signal is transmitted from top to bottom. The proposed algorithm is 
employed to find all one-to-many AMNDCS reliabilities from node 1 to each subset of target nodes with 
limited cost and capacity. Suppose that the cost and capacity demands cannot be greater than 8 and less 
than 7, respectively. The cost and capacity functions for the elements are shown in Tables 1 and 2, 
correspondingly.

C8. Conclusions 
Network reliability theory has been applied extensively in many real-world systems. However, 
most of the methods of network reliability evaluation consider only the cases without constraint or just a 
single constraint. In this paper, a special but practical problem that considers the AMNDCS reliability 
and the total cost together with the capacity of all components simultaneously is presented. 
The AMNDCS is an extension of the multi-state network. A new technique, which extended rather 
than repeated the existing UGFMs, is presented to solve all one-to-many AMNDCS reliabilities under 
cost and capacity constraints. The definitions of the multiplication operator “” (in Eq. (19)) and 
node-UGFs (in Eq. (27) are revised in the paper. A formula and also its simplified forms for special 
cases (see Eqs. (30)-(35)) are proposed for obtaining subnet-UGFMs. The cost and capacity constraints 
are not simply treated as constraints when evaluating reliability. They are merged together as a special 
exponent of “z” and operated efficiently to reduce unfeasible items in subnet-UGFs during the 
procedure (not the final result) of finding reliability to enhance the efficiency. Thus, the proposed 
UGFM is an intuitive, simple, efficient, and effective method.

D. The Extension of Universal Generating Function Method to Search for all One-to-many 
d-Minimal Paths of Acyclic Multi-State-Arc Flow-Conservation Networks 
Abstract  Evaluating the network reliability is an important topic in the planning, design, and control 
of systems. The acyclic multi-state-arc flow-conservation network (AMAFCN) is a special 
multi-state-arc flow-conservation network (MAFCN) of which each arc has independent, discrete, 
limited multi-states (capacities) and satisfied flow conservation. The AMAFCN is arranged in such a 
way that no flow leaving a node can return this node through any sequence of nodes, e.g. no cycles exist. 
For such networks, we are interested in evaluating the AMAFCN reliability, i.e. the probability that the 
flow from the source node to the sink node is equal to or greater than a demanded flow of d units. A 
general method for the MAFCN/AMAFCN reliability evaluation is using minimal path/cut vectors with 
system state d (called the d-MPs/d-MCs). In this study, we focused on developing an extension of the 
universal generating function method (UGFM) to find the entire one-to-many d-MPs before calculating

The evaluation of the MAFCN or MNFDN reliability is a NP-hard problem [4,5] even the network 
is acyclic. Many methods had been developed to solve the MAFCN reliability, including the exact 
methods based on cut/path set [1-16], which can calculate the exact value of reliability, and some 
approximate methods [17,18], which can estimate the approximate value of network reliability and 
avoid the NP-hard problem faced by the cut/path-based methods. Exact network reliability evaluation 
approaches exploit a variety of tools for system modeling and reliability index calculation. Among the 
most popular tools are network-based algorithms founded in terms of either d-MPs or d-MCs for the 
MAFCNs/AMAFCNs reliability evaluation. A minimal path/cut (MP/MP) is an arc subset and any 
proper subset of MC/MP is not a MC/MP, i.e. if any arc is removed from the MC/MP, then the 
remaining set is no longer a path/cut [5,6,11,12,16,24]. The d-MP/d-MC is a MP/MC vector such that 
the maximal flow (minimal cut) from the source node to the sink node (with no cycle) via this vector is 
d [7-10,13-16]. 
The general method for reliability evaluation limits the discussions to two-terminal reliability 
analysis. To the author’s best knowledge, most of the existing-known algorithms for finding all d-MPs 
need to search for all MPs first. Unfortunately, to search for all MPs or MCs is also a NP-hard problem 
[5,6,11,12,18,24]. Recently, Yeh proposed a novel algorithm to search for d-MPs without knowing MPs 
in advance based on a special mathematical programming model for the flow [15]. Yeh’s algorithm is 
very simple and easy to understand and implement. However, Yeh’s algorithm works only for the 
one-to-one d-MP problem [15]. It seems to be superfluous when applied to one-to-many AMAFCN 
reliability problem. The need for an efficient and intuitive method to search for all one-to-many d-MPs 
in the AMAFCN thus arises. 
UGFM was introduced in Ref. [19] and was proven to be very effective for evaluating the 
reliability of different types of multi-state network [20,21,23,25], because it does not require a great 
computational effort. The further developments and applications of UGF technique were presented in 
[21,22,25] and detailed description one can find in [21,22] that summarized recent achievements in the 
field. The UGFM is straightforward, effective, and universal [20]. It involves intuitively simple 
recursive procedures combined with simplification techniques. The purpose of the paper is to extend 
UGFM using the simple operation of sets to search for entire one-to-many d-MPs to calculate the 
one-to-many AMAFCN reliability. 
D2. UGFM: MAIN DEFINITIONS AND PROPERTIES 
The detailed description of the UGFMs is presented in [20,21]. In this section, a brief introduction 
to the traditional UGFM for the AMNFDN is given. Define UGFs and search for all states are two cores 
of the UGFM. To assure that all states are correct and completely included in the UGFM, there are two 
types of UGFs: the individual UGF (called the node-UGF in this study) and the group UGF (called the 
 61
D3. UGFM FORMULATION AND PRELIMINARIES 
This section presents the proposed UGFM for finding one-to-many d-MPs in AMAFCN. A brief 
introduction to the basic elements and the fundamental concept of the proposed UGFM with some 
useful properties is given here firstly. From above introduction, the key point to success implement 
UGFM is that each state of nodes and sub-networks must be correct and complete included in 
node-UGFs and subnet-UGFs. The UGFM is a complete examination of all possible states of each 
node-/subnet-UGF, which implies its correctness. In the proposed UGFM, both of node-UGFs u(i) and 
subnet-UGF U(i) are special set of arc subsets. All arcs in the former subsets included the same tail: 
node i; each element in the latter is a (i: iV
 )-MP. Before the formal introduction of the proposed 
node-UGF, the proposed node-UGF is defined as follows: 
u(i) = :
 and i
i I
I I V
z
 
  (6) 
where I iV   is a non-empty node subset emanating from the node i, and i:I is the arc subset s.t. the 
node i can send flows to all nodes in I via all arcs in i:I,. For example, in Fig. 1, we have u(1) and u(2) 
as follows: 
u(1) =
1
1:
 and {2,3}
I
I I V
z
  

I I V
z
  
  (9) 
 =2:3z+2:5z+2:{3,5}z (10) 
The function u(i) indicates all possible way to transfer flow from node i. For example, Fig. 3 shows 
the corresponding sub-networks w.r.t. to the coefficients in u(1) in Eq.(7).

The following simple observation, which we state without proof, lies at the heart of the correctness 
of the fundamental of the proposed UGFM. It discusses an important and special characteristic of 
one-to-many MPs.

Immediately from the above rules, some elementary facts concerning the node labels, and the 
coefficients of node-UGF and subnet-UGF are brought together as follows. 
Property 1: If there is a directed path from nodes i to j, then i<j. Moreover, there is a directed path 
from nodes i to j if and only if i<j and iT. 
Property 2: i:Iu(i) if and only if {eij | for all jI}E. 
Property 3: i:IBU(i) if and only if i:Iu(i), BU(i1), and Bi:I is a connected arc subset. 
Property 4: BU(i) and node i is not an endpoint in B if and only if BU(i1), and Bi:I is a 
disconnected arc subset for all i:Iu(i). 
 
From Corollary 1, Properties 1-4, and Theorem 1, we obtain the following fundamental result.  
Theorem 2: The following statements are equivalent. 
(a) BU(i).  (24) 
(b) B is a (1: iV
 )-MP.  (25) 
(c) B is a connected arc subsets, i.e. G({the endpoints of the arcs in B}, B) is a connected 
sub-network. 
(d) B=i:IB*, where i:Iu(i) and B*U(i1). 
 
Theorem 2 summarizes the preceding discussion about the relationships among the coefficients of 
subnet-UGFs U(i), (1: iV
 )-MP, and the corresponding sub-network of U(i). Moreover, it shows that all 
(1: iV
 )-MPs are correct and complete included in U(i), and vice versa. The following results are easy 
and immediate consequences of the preceding theorem. 
Corollary 2: { | for all (1: iV  )-MP }={B | for all BU(i)}. (26) 
Corollary 3: All (1:I)-MPs are included in U(i)=U(i1)u(i) for all I iV   and i.

where f represents the amount of flow in the network from node 1 to node n. The preceding linear 
programming model is adapted and revised into a special integer programming model to find all 
one-to-many d-MP candidates using the implicit enumeration technique. It is based on the definition of 
the d-MP candidate and the above max-flow mathematical programming model.

Proof:  Follow from the definition of the one-to-many d-MP candidate and Eqs. (28)-(30). 
 
Theorem 4 is based on the flow conversation law (Eq.(31)), the definition of d-MP candidates (i.e. 
the maximal flow for each one-to-many d-MP candidate is d, see Eq.(32)), the capacity limitation of 
each arc (Eq.(33)), and the flow needs to through all arcs in (1: iV
 )-MP (Eq.(34)). Obviously, all 
one-to-many d-MP are one-to-many d-MP candidates. The following lemma is an efficient tool to verify 
whether a d-MP candidate is a real d-MP. It is first proposed and proved in [16]. It is also true for 
one-to-many d-MP candidates. 
Property 5: A d-MP candidate X is a d-MP if there is no directed cycle in X. 
 
If the flow network is acyclic, then there is no directed cycle in each one-to-many d-MP candidate, 
i.e. each one-to-many d-MP candidate is a real one-to-many d-MP by Property 5. Therefore, we have 
the following theorem immediately. 
Theorem 5: If the network is acyclic, then every one-to-many d-MP candidate is a real one-to-many 
d-MP.

total number of states in U(|VT|) also equal to Eq.(36). Thus, we have therefore constructively proved 
the following result. 
Theorem 6: The proposed UGFM needs O(2
|E|
) time complexity to find all one-to-many d-MPs and 
O(2
|E|
) units of memory capacity to save all one-to-many d-MPs. 
D5. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES 
The general procedure is best illustrated with an example. The total degree of all nodes will grow 
exponentially with the number of nodes in the worst case [14,15]. The AMAFCN reliability evaluation 
possesses a computational difficulty that grows exponentially with the network size. Owing to this 
inherent problem, instead of presenting practically large network systems, a benchmark network shown 
in Fig. 1 is selected to demonstrate this methodology as in all existing algorithms [20-25]. 
The first example illustrates STEPs 0-3 of the proposed UGFM for finding entire (1:I)-MPs for all 
IV. These (1:I)-MPs are all transferred into one-to-many 2-MPs in Example 2 to solve the 
one-to-many d-MP problem for d=2 using STEP 4. 
Example 1: Consider the benchmark AMAFCN presented in Fig. 1, where node 1 is the source node. 
STEPs 0-3 of the proposed UGFM is used to search entire (1:I)-MPs for all IV. 
Solution: 
STEP 0. Let i=1 and set up 
U(1) =u(1)  (37) 
 =1:{2}z+1:{3}z+1:{2,3}z (38) 
STEP 1. Since i=1<n|T|=3, let i=i+1=2 and let X2={1:{2}}. 
STEP 2. Set up u(2) as follows: 
u(2) =2:{3}z+2:{5}z+2:{3,5}z (39) 
STEP 3. Calculate the subnet-UGF U(2)=U(1)u(2) as follows (also shown in Eqs.(19)-(23)): 
U(2) =U(1)u(2) (40)

D6. CONCLUSIONS 
The UGFM had been proved very efficient in evaluating the one-to-many-targets AMNFDN 
reliability, which is a special MNFDN without any cycle. However, there is no UGFM for the 
one-to-many AMAFCN reliability problem. A new UGFM is introduced in this article using the simple 
operation of sets to calculate entire one-to-many AMAFCN reliabilities. It first searches for all 
(1:I)-MPs for IV based on the proposed UGFM. Each (1:I)-MPs is then transferred into the 
corresponding one-to-many d-MPs. Finally, the entire one-to-many AMAFCN reliabilities are 
calculated based on one-to-many d-MPs.

E. Reliability Evaluation for the new type of Receiving Multi-state Signal Network  
Abstract 
 In this paper, we propose a new type of Multistate-Signal Network (MSN) which named 
“Receiving MSN”. The suggested algorithm “Receiving Universal Generating Function” (RUGF) is 
based on the improved UGF for the proposed receiving network. In the real world, we may only be able 
to obtain a signal’s information either on status or probability and the emanating probability cannot be 
obtained easily. The traditional UGF can only be used to solve the emanation-based network. Since the 
reliability of the proposed receipt-based network could not be evaluated by using the traditional UGF, 
we suggest a new reliability evaluation method for this new type of receiving network by using a 
generalization of the tree-structured multistate network and the receipt-based network system. An 
example has been given to illustrate the significant operation of the proposed RUGF. 
E1. Introduction 
 According to the adherence of the flow conservation law, there exists some reliability problems  
in these two categories of network: the Multistate-Flow Network (MFN) and the Multistate-Signal 
Network (MSN). In MFN, we assume that 1) each arc has non-negative integer-valued random variable 
capacity (multistate-flow). 2) The state of each node is perfect and all flows obey the flow conservation 
law. On the other hand, in MSN, we assume that 1) each arc in MSN is assumed to be perfect. 2) The 
state of each node is determined by a set of nodes receiving the signal directly from it without satisfying 
the flow conservation law (multistate-signal). These two networks have their own applications. For 
example, electrical power distribution can be modeled as MFN, and computer network or cellular 
telephone network can be modeled as MSN. 
 MSAN has three types of nodes: 1) source node that can only emit and send a signal to other nodes; 
2) a number of sink nodes that can only receive a signal; and 3) a number of intermediate nodes (neither 
source nor sink nodes) that retransmit the received signal to other non-source nodes. The signal is 
transmtted from a non-sink node to a number of non-source nodes along edges between these nodes, i.e. 
multistates. No signal leaving a node can return to itself through any node sequence. The probability 
that nodes (states) cannot be transmitted to the next node set is assumed known for each non-sink node. 
All of these probabilities are assumed to be statistically independent. MSAN is more practical and 
reasonable than a Traditional Network (TN) that satisfies the conservation law in many real-life 
situations such as computer or cellular telephone networks [1–13]. Therefore, the analysis of MSAN has 
become an important issue in system reliability.

According to Fig.1, these probabilities represent all possible states of sending signal flow from the 
emanating sets to the receiving sets. These two different probabilities are based on different roles of 
node, even if when they are in the same network. 
<< Insert Table 1 >> 
 We take node 2 as an example. If our viewpoint is based on emanation, the receiving set of node 2 
is {{3}, {5}, {3, 5}, {Ø}}. Alternatively, if our viewpoint is based on receipt, the emanating set of node 
2 is {{1}, {Ø}}. The sum of the total probabilities is 1. Note that the probabilities of transferring signal 
from node 1 to node 2 are different in these two situations. Because this node plays different roles and 
occupies different positions in particular sets, the probabilities that the same arc can work for various 
sets are different. 
E4. Traditional Universal Generating Function 
 This section will review the Universal Generating Function (UGF) technique. In this paper, we 
refer the traditional UGF as “Emanating UGF” (EUGF) and the suggested method as “Receiving UGF” 
(RUGF). The UGF (u -transfrom) of discrete random variable X is defined as a polynomial where the 
variable X has K possible values and qk is the probability that X is equal to Xk.

                 (1) 
 In order to represent all possible sets of MSAN nodes that emanate a signal, the equation will be 
redefined. The variable Xk shows all possible states and their probabilities; qk, corresponds to the 
occurred state k in MSAN system. However, this information could be accounted for redefining the 
u-function. When considering a certain node, there exists an equation to describe a signal transmission 
from node i to the corresponding receiving subset I.  
ui = pi,I                 (2) 
 Equation (2) represents the u-function, lists all possible probability of states of transmitted signals 
from the specific node k to the corresponding receiving subset j. 
 In order to combine these u-functions, we let Ui represent the group of the u-functions including 
u1... ui. For this purpose, we introduce a composition operator  over the u-functions of the individual 
states. Equation (2) can be written as follows: 
 Ui+1 = Ui  ui+1 ∀i∈V-T             (3) 
 In equation (3), the composition operator  is similar to the multiplication operator. We can obtain 
the group of u-functions which representing the distribution of MSAN when all the possible states are 
considered by applying the above equation. However, if the receiving set of each term in Ui can not 
match the next node (i+1), we conserve this term until the suitable u-function is found. 
 When Ui is obtained, there are some methods for simplifying the terms in Ui . Indeed, when

<< Insert Fig. 2 >> 
 According to the above example, we find that the EUGF has some limitations.  It can only apply 
to solve the multistate network and it could not solve the new receiving multistate network. Therefore 
we can only apply EUGF to solve the reliability problem for the multistate emanating network but not 
the new type receiving network as it is different from the traditional emanating network. 
E5. THE Preliminary and property of receiving msan 
 In order to represent random sets of receiving MSAN nodes that receive a signal, we modify the 
RUGF by redefining the equation (1). We define a new u-function which has included all the possible 
states and the probabilities that correspond to each possible state in the receiving MSAN system. When 
considering a certain node I, there exits an equation to describe a signal transmission from the 
corresponding set of emanating nodes to the node i. In order to represent the transmitted signals from 
emanating sets to the specific node i, we redefine equation (2) by substituting: 
ũi = pI,i                 (13) 
 Equation (13) represents the u-function which lists all possible probability of states corresponding 
to the transmitted signals from emanating sets to the specific node i. However, node 1 is a source node 
without receiving any arc out, so we do not need to list the u-function of node 1. Both equation (13) and 
equation (2) represent the signal transmission, but equation (2) is used to describe a receiving set for 
specific node i. 
  To represent all possible combinations of the states probability, one has to relate the 
corresponding probabilities (obtained by multiplying the probabilities of corresponding states) in these 
states. For this purpose, we introduce a composition operator ⊙ over u-functions of individual states. 
The u-function of the entire aggregate from node 1 to node k can be represented as Ui. It can be 
presented as equation (14). 
 Ũi= Ũi-1⊙ũi= {Ũi-1*+Ũi-1ũi} ∀i∈I              (14) 
 Equation (14) is an important recurring procedure. Note that this equation is different from 
equation (3). In this equation, we have conserved some original terms. These original terms will be 
combined with next u-function. If we do not conserve some original terms, we will lose some terms.  
 We take an example for operator ⊙ without considering the conserved terms, let 
ũ2 = {p1,2}                (15) 
ũ3 = {p1,3+p2,3+p{1,2},3}              (16) 
then  
 Ũ2 = ũ2                  (17) 
  = {p1,2}                (18) 
 Ũ3 = Ũ2⊙ũ3                 (19) 
 81
 From the above example, if have implemented equation (13), equation (14), properties 1 and 2 
together. We can see that the term, p1,2, has been conserved from equation (24) with property 1, and the 
term, p1,3, has been conserved from equation (24) with property 2. 
 However, it can be anticipated that there requires a lot computation power in the recursive 
procedure. Therefore we suggest a property to delete some terms in order to simplify the calculation and 
reduce the computation time for some situations before composing the next u-function. The suggestion 
has been shown in Property 3. 
Property 3: 
 If the subsets of Ũi can not connect to the specific node v ( i<v), we can delete these subsets before 
composing next u-function. Since the network is disconnected, the signal cannot be transmitted from the 
source node to the target subsets. It means that this part should not belong to any system reliability 
calculation. For example, if we continue the procedure from equation (24). We can list the next 
u-function of the node 4 and combine U3 and u4 by equation (14) as: 
  ũ 4 = {e3,4}               (25) 
then 
  Ũ4 = Ũ3⊙ũ4                (26) 
  = {Ũ3*+Ũ3 ũ4}               (27) 
  = {(p1,2+p1,2p1,3+p1,2p2,3+p1,2p{1,2},3+p1,3) 
  +( p1,2p1,3p3,4+p1,2p2,3p3,4+p1,2p{1,2},3p3,4+p1,3p3,4)}        (28) 
 We can see that the term, Ũ3⊙ũ4, is {p1,2p1,3p3,4+p1,2p2,3p3,4+p1,2p{1,2},3p3,4+p1,3p3,4}. Among these 
terms, the term, e1,2e3,4, will not be combined because the sub-network e1,2 and node 4 are disconnected. 
Therefore, we should delete it before we compose U3 with u4. 
 The final step is the implementation of the proposed RUGF to calculate the exact reliability. It 
follows immediately from the fundamental probability theory. This fact is obvious and easy to 
understand so we have omitted the proof in this paper.  The receiving MSAN system reliability from 
node 1 to all target subsets {t}, r{t}, is given from Un, and the illustrative example has been shown in 
section VII. The receiving MSAN system reliability from node 1 to the target subset t can be expressed 
as:  
      for all t at aR r a T               (29) 
 From equation (29), we can get all the possible states from the source node to the subsets of target 
set through the information of target nodes. Therefore, we can get the reliability of receiving MSAN 
system.

and all the nodes belong to target subsets (R{t}) can be obtained from the group of u-functions of target 
nodes, U5. 
 The suggested RUGF graph can show all the possible existing paths. However, the presentation of 
the paths from source node to target nodes between EUGF and RUGF are different. According to the 
above results, we can conclude that the suggested RUGF can solve the given receiving information 
problem which can not be solved by using traditional EUGF.
