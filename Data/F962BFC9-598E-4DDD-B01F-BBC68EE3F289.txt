Abstract 
Adaptation of modulation and transmission bit-rates for video multicast in a multi-rate wireless network 
is a challenging problem because of network dynamics, variable video bit-rates, and heterogeneous clients 
who may expect differentiated video qualities. Prior work on the leader-based schemes selects the 
transmission bit-rate that provides reliable transmission for the node that experiences the worst channel 
condition. However, this may penalize other nodes that can achieve a higher throughput by receiving at a 
higher rate. In this project, we investigate a rate-adaptive video multicast scheme that can provide 
heterogeneous clients differentiated visual qualities matching their channel conditions. We first propose a rate 
scheduling model that selects the optimal transmission bit-rate for each video frame to maximize the total 
visual quality for a multicast group subject to the minimum-visual-quality-guaranteed constraint. We then 
present a practical and easy-to-implement protocol, which constructs a cluster-based structure to characterize 
node heterogeneity and adapts the transmission bit-rate to network dynamics based on video quality perceived 
by the representative cluster heads. We further investigate a relay-based video multicast scheme that allows 
the clients experiencing a better channel condition to select a suitable transmission bit-rate and relay data for 
neighboring poorly connected clients. We show that our scheme can adapt to network dynamics and variable 
video-bit rates efficiently, and produce a gain of 2-5dB in terms of the average video quality as compared to 
the leader-based approach.

I.  Background 
Video streaming is arguably one of the most popular multimedia applications over wireless networks 
today. Taking advantage of the wireless broadcast nature, a video source can multicast a video object to a 
group of multicast members in order to reduce the bandwidth requirement, as compared with unicasting the 
data to each individual member. However, current commercial network devices typically transmit multicast 
packets at the base rate in the MAC layer, even though 802.11 standard supports multiple bit-rates up to 11 
 4 
that allows the clients that experience a better channel condition to relay data for other poorly connected 
clients. Consider another network in Figure 2(a), where client B can only receive data from the source if 
packets are sent at 1 Mb/s. In the single-hop case, the source must broadcast data at transmission bit-rate 1 
Mb/s to ensure that data can be delivered to every client. If we choose to make client A relay data at bit-rate 
5.5 Mb/s to other clients, as shown in Figure 2(b), the source can switch to use a higher bit-rate and, hence, 
improve the overall multicast throughput. However, by using a higher rate, a relay occupies less channel time, 
while also reducing overhearing opportunity for neighboring clients. We need to address this trade-off to 
selects the suitable relay nodes and allocates bandwidth resources to the relays optimally.  
 
Figure 2. Comparison between one-hop and relay-based multicast 
The contributions of this project are as follows: 
• We propose a practical protocol, called Quality-Differentiated Multicast (QDM), which exploits a 
sample-based technique to adapt the transmission bit-rate of each video frame to variable video bit- 
rates and client mobility without the need of any pre-process. Thus, it can be applied to real-time 
video streaming.  
• We investigate the benefit of relay-based streaming, and propose a joint time-allocation and 
rate-selection model mitigate data duplication and enhance relay efficiency. 
Our simulation results show that not only can QDM provide users differentiated video quality matching 
their channel conditions, but also produce a better average visual quality as compared with the leader-based 
schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed relay-based video multicast further improves the 
average PSNR by 2−5dB as compared to single-hop multicast. 
III.  Related Work 
Wireless Multicast for Reliable Transmission: Most work on rate selection for wireless multicast 
focuses on achieving multicast reliability by selecting the rate that can deliver data reliably to the member 
with the worst channel condition. In [12], the Leader-Based Protocol (LBP) is the first leader-based approach 
proposed to overcome the problem of feedback collision. It selects the worst node as the leader to 
acknowledge multicast packets. Other members can issue negative acknowledgements to collide the 
acknowledgement sent by the leader and, thus, trigger the sender to retransmit the lost packets. The goal of 
LBP is to support reliability by a single feedback. However, it does not adapt the transmission bit rate to 
dynamic channel conditions, but only sends data at the base rate. Thus, the rate adaptation algorithms, such as 
RAM [13] and ARSM [15], are proposed for the leader-based multicast protocol. They estimate link quality 
of the leader and determine a proper rate that can better reach the leader. Both of these techniques let each 
receiver embed the information about it receiving SNR value in the CTS frame. The sender can infer the 
 6 
to the receivers before the playback deadline TGOPn. 
To realize a practical protocol, we must consider the following problems: 1) How can the scheduler 
collect the visual quality perceived by each receiver efficiently? 2) How can the scheduler determine a 
suitable rate schedule for real-time streaming if the information about incremental visual-quality of each video 
frame is not computed by pre-processing? To cope with the above practical issues, we propose 
Quality-Differentiated Multicast (QDM), a practical video multicast framework including three components: 
(1) cluster construction: it clusters clients according to their channel conditions in order to characterize the 
heterogeneity of clients; (2) sample-based rate scheduling: it predicts the rate schedule by real-time sampling; 
(3) relay selection: it selects clients with high quality links to cooperatively relay the video stream. 
A. Cluster Construction 
A key challenge to characterizing heterogeneous channel conditions of multicast members is that 
simultaneous feedback from all members causes collision. Thus, the design of QDM is to separate members to 
multiple clusters C such that the receivers with similar channel conditions can be classified into the same 
cluster. Specifically, we let r(v) denote the best rate of member v∈V if it can receive the maximal throughput 
from AP at r(v). Those who have the same best rate ri∈R can be grouped into cluster Ci = {v: v∈V, r(v)= ri}. 
Hence, a multicast group can be divided to |R| clusters, each of which can select the one in Ci who experiences 
the worst channel condition as the cluster head of Ci (denoted by CHi) to represent all members in Ci. The 
scheduler can collect heterogeneous channel conditions from the cluster heads (CHs), and reduce the overhead 
of information exchange significantly. Based on the performance reported by the representative nodes (i.e., 
CHs), the scheduler can approximate the overall video quality of a multicast group by PSNRtotal =∑Ci∈C 
PSNR(CHi) * |Ci|. where |Ci| is the number of members in cluster Ci. 
In order to collect information about |Ci| and r(v) for each v∈V, AP can send a probe packet at each rate 
r∈R before broadcasting the video stream. Based on those probe packets, each member m can estimate the bit 
error rate of each rate r∈R, and select its best rate r(v) that can produce the highest throughput, It then 
responds a control message <v, r(v), SNRv> to the rate scheduler, where SNRv is the average SNR observed by 
v. The scheduler can then use the feedback of control messages to construct the clusters, select the CHs, and 
broadcast the information <ri, CHi, SNRCHi> to each cluster Ci∈C.  
However, we note that the channel condition of each client might change dynamically due to channel 
variation or client mobility. To adapt the rate schedule to such channel dynamics, the scheduler needs to 
update the clusters as the channel condition of certain nodes changes substantially. Therefore, we let each 
member v∈Ci measure the SNR value of its received data packets, and issue a re-clustering request to the 
scheduler if it detects that its average SNR is smaller than α*SNRCHi, where 0≤α≤1 is a sensitivity coefficient. 
Once the scheduler decides to perform re-clustering, it executes the same probing procedure as what it did in 
the initialization stage such that the clients can update its channel condition to the scheduler. 
B. Sample-based Rate Selection 
The goal of QDM is to find a suitable rate for each frame efficiently for real-time video streaming. To 
reduce the complexity of rate scheduling, we sort the frames of each GOP according to their decoding order, 
and partition each GOP into three sets: essential frames (Fe), supplementary frames (Fs), and discarded frames 
(Fd), as shown in Figure 3, where variables ne, ns, and nd are the number of frames in the sets Fe, Fs, and Fd, 
 8 
of binary variables where the ith bit equals 1 if the CH receives the ith packet of a GOP correctly, and 0 
otherwise. The scheduler can compute PSNRtotal of each sample GOP by decoding the stream with the packet 
losses pattern logged in the masks reported by CHs and comparing the decoded GOP with the original stream. 
The scheduler can set rs to the rate used by the sample GOP that achieves the highest PSNRtotal. After the 
sampling stage (i.e., the first three sample GOPs), the scheduler can use the updated rs and ne for the rest of 
GOPs in the current sampling interval. The whole procedure repeats for each sampling interval. 
C. Relay Selection 
The goal of relay-based multicast to allow relays to utilize Tdiff to help forward the enhancement layer 
such that the video quality can be maximized. The relay-based design faces the following challenges. First, 
since all of the sender and relay nodes contend for the channel time, we must allocate it to all forwarders 
efficiently. Second, each forwarder must select a suitable transmission bit-rate for packet transmission. Lastly, 
each forwarder must determine which frames should be relayed such that clients can avoid receiving 
duplicated data from different relays. To address the above issues, we first propose the following model to 
allocate time and bit-rate, and then apply network coding to alleviate the duplication problem.

kth packet if both A and B do not receive and encode the
kth packet. Thus, we can compute the probability of failing
to decode a packet by pfail = (1−psA(rs)) ∗ (1−psB(rs)).
Then, A and B can cooperatively relay the expected number
of packets n¯AB=

C can decode at most 13 packets.
4) Many-to-many: The above cases help us understand
the concept of choosing a suitable batch size. However, a
general environment, such as Figure 2(d), could be much more
complicated. Ideally, to maximize the goodput, all relays must
select their batch sizes cooperatively, which makes batch size
selection a challenging problem.
To reduce the complexity, we propose a heuristic scheme in
Algorithm 1 that allows each relay to coordinate with at most
one another relay. The rational behind this design is that, if
most of receivers can hear at most two relays, our algorithm
can approximate the solution that allows all relays to cooperate
with each other. In Algorithm 1, if a relay f does not cooperate
with any other relay, it can encode the first b received packets.
We define a 0-1 variable ωjf (b) that equals 1 if receiver j can
decode the packets sent by relay f using a batch size b, i.e.,
n′fpfj≥b and, at the same time, these decodable packets are
not duplicate with packets from other forwarders, and equals
0 otherwise. However, if two relays f and q cooperatively
encode the same native packets in a batch with size b, they
can relay the expected number of packets n¯fq=∑bk=0 kCbk(1−
pfail)
kp(b−k)fail for each receiver. Hence, we let κjfq(n¯fq) be a
0-1 variable that equals 1 if j can decode the packets from
f and q, i.e., n′fpfj+n′qpqj≥n¯fq and, again, these packets are
not duplicate, and 0 otherwise.
We use the example with the forwarder set F={A,B,C}
in Figure 2(d) to explain the proposed algorithm. For ease of
description, we assume that, in this example, the link reliability

between the sender and any relay equals 1, i.e., no packet loss
at each relay. The algorithm can also be applied to general
scenarios where the link reliability is not equal to 1. Table I
computes the number of decodable packets relayed by each
f∈F (i.e., pif ) for various batch sizes bf . Let us first consider
the case that relayB does not cooperate with any other relay. If
B sets the batch size b=12, it can only generate 12 decodable
packets because only E can receive 12 packets and decode
them. However, if B sets b=10, piB equals 10∗2=20 packets
because both E and F can receiver at least 10 packets relayed
by B and decode 10 native packets.
On the other hand, if B cooperates with A and sets the batch
size bB=20(A), which represents the batch size 20 selected
by B as cooperating with A, we get piB=20 because only E
can receive 20 packets (8 from A and 12 from B). However,
if B cooperates with C and set bB=18(C), it can produce
piB=18∗2=36 because both recipients E and F can receive
more than 18 packets from B and C. Then, the maximal
number of decodable packets relayed by B equals 36 as it
cooperates with C to set the batch size at 18.
Relay A and C can apply the same procedure to compute
their pi. Based on Table I, we observe that, in the first iteration,
B generates the maximal number of decodable packets (i.e.,
36) among all relays as it cooperates with C. Therefore,
we first assign bB=bC=18 and remove B and C from the
scheduling queue F . As a result, only relay A remains in F .
Then, since we allow each relay to cooperate with at most one
another relay, A can not cooperate with B and C anymore.
Consequently, we must delete the candidate (20(B), 20)) from
forwarder A’s entry. Now, since E and F already get 18
packets from B and C, i.e., dE = dF = 18. Now, the packets
from A become redundant for receiver E. Therefore, A can
adjust its table as shown in the second iteration of Table I,
and update A’s decision to (10, 10). The same procedure can
be applied until each relay selects its batch size, i.e., F=φ.
After solving the time schedule tf , rate selection rf , and
the batch size bf , the sender can broadcast such information to
all clients. A client f that is designated as a relay (i.e., tf>0)
must forward the coded packets at rate rf within the time
interval tf . If a relay is assigned to cooperate with another
relay, it must encode the packets with a sequence number no
larger than bf ; otherwise, it can encode the first bf packets.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION
We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the
proposed relay-based video multicast. We deploy the router
 
The above time-allocation rate-selection model considers a two-hop relay scenario; namely, each client 
only relays the packets received from the sender. F denotes the set of relays, and tf and rf denote the time and 
rate allocated to relay f, respectively. Thus, the first constrain  restricts that the amount of d ta forwarded by a 
relay f∈V cannot exceed the amount of data delivered from the sender to f. The second constraint bounds the 
total transmission time allocated to all forwarders up to Tdiff. The last constraint guarantees that the data rate 
received by each client cannot exceed the average video rate Rv. Finally, the objective is to maximize the total 
throughput for all multicast members. 
In general, the goodput, i.e., the rate of useful data, must be lower than the throughput derived in the 
model because a client might receive duplicated packets from different relays. Hence, in th  second phase, 
based on the time schedule solved in the model, we apply the network coding technology to alleviate packet 
 10 
locating nearby AP. However, the side effect is that it instead penalizes most of clients who cannot receive the 
enhancement layer, which is sent at a higher rate (i.e., the transmission bit- rate of the best node). Therefore, 
in H-ARSM, 47% of clients cannot achieve PSNRmin (i.e., 30dB), and, even worse, get lower PSNR than those 
in ARSM. Unlike H- ARSM that produces two extreme qualities (extremely high and low PSNR), QDM can 
exploit the cluster-based structure to characterize the heterogeneity of clients, and, thereby, provide each user 
a visual quality matching its channel condition. Besides, almost all clients in QDM can achieve PSNRmin.

client. We compare the following schemes: (1) Oracle:
the dynamic-programming-based solution with oracle
information, as shown in Algorithm 1; (2) QDM: the
proposed quality-differentiated multicast; (3) ARSM: the
leader-based solution, which selects the transmission bit-
rate based on the worst node; (4) H-ARSM: the two-
level solution, which selects the rate for the base layer
according to the channel condition of the worst node,
while selects the rate for the enhancement layer based
on the best node; (5) BASE-RATE: the baseline scheme
that always sends packets at the base rate.
5.1 Video Quality Comparison
We uniformly distribute 30 clients at random in a 100m
by 100m field. Figure 6 shows the CDF of PSNR per-
ceived by each client. Since the best rate of the worst
node in this scenario is the base rate (1 Mb/s), ARSM
performs the same with BASE-RATE. Thus, we exclude
the results of BASE-RATE from Figure 6. In ARSM,
because the stream is sent at the fixed base rate, all
clients can receive the same subset of frames and get the
same quality (about 32dB). On the other hand, since H-
ARSM sends the base-layer and the enhancement-layer
at two different transmission bit-rates, it can provide a
better video quality for the clients locating nearby AP.
However, the side effect is that it instead penalizes most
of clients who cannot receive the enhancement layer,
which is sent at a higher rate (i.e., the transmission bit-
rate of the best node). Therefore, in H-ARSM, 47% of
clients cannot achieve PSNRmin (i.e., 30dB), and, even
worse, get lower PSNR than those in ARSM. Unlike H-
ARSM that produces two extreme qualities (extremely
high and low PSNR), QDM can exploit the cluster-based
structure to characterize the heterogeneity of clients, and,
thereby, provide each user a visual quality matching its
channel condition. Besides, almost all clients in QDM can
achieve PSNRmin.
In Figure 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c), we compare the perfor-
mance of all schemes under three different node dis-
tributions, i.e., uniform, normal, and zipf, respectively.
The zipf distribution is defined as P [20 ∗ (i − 1) ≤
dist ≤ 20 ∗ i] = c
i
, for i=1, 2, · · · , K , where dist is
the distance between the client and AP, c = (
∑K
i=1
1
i
)−1,
and K is the network size (defined as the radius of a
topology) divided by 20m. The characteristic of the zipf
distribution is that the probability of placing a client
nearby AP is higher than that of placing it far from AP;
hence, it can represent an environment where most of
clients are close to AP, while only a few clients are distant
from AP and experience a worse channel condition.
On the other hand, the normal distribution means that
the distance between each client and AP follows the
normal distribution, which means that only few clients
are extremely close to or far from AP.
In the uniform and zipf distributions, we vary the net-
work size from 20m to 160m; in the normal distribution,
we fix the mean of the network size to 60m and vary
the standard deviation from 5 to 40 since the maximal
radius cannot be known in the normal distribution.
We note that, in all distributions, BASE-RATE provides
clients similar video qualities because AP always sends
the stream at the base rate without considering various
channel conditions of clients. On the other hand, ARSM
can outperform BASE-RATE when the network size is
small because it could select the rate according to the
channel condition of the worst node. Hence, when the
network size is small, the rate used by the leader could
be higher than the base rate. Thus, ARSM allows clients
to receive a higher throughput and video quality as
compared to BASE-RATE. However, when the network
size grows, the sender will transmit at the lowest base-
rate even if there is only a single client, the worst client,
that can only receive at the base-rate. In this case, ARSM
performs exactly the same with BASE-RATE when the
network size is larger than 80m.
Even though H-ARSM notices the heterogeneity of
clients, it enables clients using the same rate with the
best node to receive a better visual quality by penalizing
other clients. Such a two-level strategy could be suitable
for the zipf distribution, where most nodes gather nearby
the sender. However, it may perform worse than BASE-
RATE when most of nodes locate between the best node
and the worst node, such as in the normal or uniform
distribution. By contrast, the proposed QDM can provide
a higher average PSNR than other schemes no matter
in which node distribution. This is because the cluster-
 
Figure 6. Impact of Node Distribution on Visual Quality 
In Figure 6, we compare the performance of all schemes under three different node distributions, i.e., 
uniform, n rm l, and zipf, respe tively. In all distributions, BASE-RATE provi s clients similar video 
qualities because AP always sends the stream at the base rate without considering various channel conditions 
of clients. On the oth r h n , ARSM can outperform BASE-RATE when the network size is small because it 
could select the rate according to the channel condition of the worst node. Hence, when the network size is 
small, the rate used by the leader could be higher than the base rate. However, when the network size grows, 
the sender will transmit at the lowest base-rate even if there is only the worst client that can only receive at the 
base-rate. Even though H-ARSM notices the heterogeneity of clients, it enables clients using the same rate 
with the best node to receive a b tter visual quality by p nalizing other clients. Such a two-level strategy 
could be suitable for the zipf distribution, where most nodes gather nearby the sender. However, it may 
perform worse than BASE-RATE when most of nodes locate between the best node and the worst node, such 
as in the normal or uniform distribution. By contrast, the proposed QDM can provide a higher average PSNR 
than other schemes no matter in which node distribution. This is because the cluster-based structure can 
capture the heterogeneity of clients; hence, it can select an appropriate rate to transmit e ch video fr me, and 
maximize video quality for each cluster. Besides, unlike H-ARSM, which does not consider the minimum 
video quality requirement, QDM first provides each node a minimum video quality, and then attempts to 
i prove the total PSNR. Hence, the worst nodes in QDM do not suffer from the starvation problem.

in the center of a network, and distribute clients using polar
coordinates (d, θ), where d is the distance from the router to
a client and θ is the angular coordinate. For each client, we
select its angle θ uniformly at random, and apply different
distributions, such as uniform or normal, to randomly assign
the distance d. The default number of clients is 20. All nodes
support 802.11b bitrates 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mb/s. We set the
transmission power at 10dBm, and apply the 802.11b PHY
Simulink Model [10] as the channel error model. All figures
represent the average results over 10 random topologies.
The video streams foreman.yuv are encoded as the H.264
QCIF format and decoded by JM15.1 with the average video
bit rate 300 kbps. The frame rate is 30 frames per second so
that TGOP is 0.5s. Each simulation compares the following
schemes: (1) the proposed relay-based scheme, (2) the pro-
posed scheme without network-coding (3) the one-hop scheme
[8], which allows the sender to select a suitable bit-rate for
each frame.
We first let the radial coordinate follow the uniform distri-
bution, and vary the radius of a network from 150m to 300m.
Figure 3(a) shows that, even without network coding, the
relay-based protocol can improve the average PSNR by about
3dB as compared to the one-hop scheme. In addition, by using
network coding, we can reduce packet duplication, and further
improve the average PSNR by 2dB. For all schemes, the video
quality declines when the network size grows because the
channel quality becomes worse due to the long link distance.
However, the relay-based scheme can still provide 1.5dB
improvement even when the network radius is 300m.
We also examine the scenarios when users’ radial coor-
dinates follow the normal distribution, which represents the
scenario where most of clients have a similar distance to the
sender. In Figure 3(b), we fix the average distance d to 150m,
and vary the standard deviations to simulate how dense are
clients gathered. The figure shows that our scheme produces a
gain up to 7dB as compared to the one-hop scheme. We also
notice that the network coding gain in the normal distribution
case is not as obvious as that in the uniform distribution. The
reason is that when clients have similar distances to the sender,
they can be partitioned based on their angular coordinates
into multiple groups, each of which only requires one relay
to forward data. Therefore, the packet duplication problem is
relatively slight in the normal distribution cases.
Next, we evaluate the impact of node density by fixing the
topology radius to 200m and varying the number of clients.
Figure 3(c) shows that when the network becomes dense (e.g.,
25 clients), the average PSNR of the relay-based scheme
increases because the sender can find an enough number of
relays to forward packets for those poorly connected clients.
However, when the network becomes too dense, the average
PSNR decreases instead because the number of clients as-
signed to relay data increases, resulting in contention among
relays. It is worth noting that the relay-based scheme without
network coding performs poorly when the network is too
dense because the increasing number of relays increases the
probability of packet duplication.
V. CONCLUSION
We have introduced relay-based wireless video multicast,
which enables part of clients to relay data for poorly-
connected clients. We formulate a joint time-scheduling and
rate-selection model that allocates the channel time and the
suitable rate to each relay, and then propose an intra-stream
network coding scheme to mitigate packet duplication. The
simulation results show that our relay-based scheme can
produce a higher PSNR than single-hop multicast.
