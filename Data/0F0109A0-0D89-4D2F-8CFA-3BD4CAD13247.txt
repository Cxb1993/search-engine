（一）計畫中文摘要
本計畫主要是研究高精度工具機之快速進給系統中具有止推軸承支撐之滾珠導螺桿
在移動斜向負載作用下之動態行為。由於滾珠導螺桿是高精度工具機之快速進給系統中關
鍵性的零組件，而且在加工的過程中常會受到工作台的斜向作用力作用，工作台的斜向作
用力包括了垂直向下的力量以及推工作台移動的反作用力，因為工作台會由滾珠導螺桿之
作用而移動，在加工的過程中滾珠導螺桿的運動狀況直接影響到工件加工的品質，因此研
究滾珠導螺桿在移動斜向負載作用下之動態行為對高精度工具機的研發是非常重要的一個
課題。在本計畫中滾珠導螺桿以具簡支撐之旋轉軸來模擬，兩邊各由一個止推軸承及一般
軸承來支撐，而移動斜向負載包括了軸向推力及側向力。首先應用拉格朗至法推導出系統
運動方程式，並且利用朗吉—庫塔積分法求得系統在移動負載作用下的暫態響應，並以傅

（二）計畫英文摘要。
In this project the dynamic characteristics of a ball screw supported by a thrust bearing
under a moving skew load in the high feed drive system of high precision machine tools is
analyzed. The ball screw is one of the most important components in the high feed drive system
of high precision machine tools. It always sustains the reacting skew force of the moving working
table during the milling process. The reacting skew force of the moving working table contains
the straight down force and the force pushing the working table moving forward and backward.
The move of working table is controlled by the ball screw and the dynamic response of the ball
screw will affect the precision of the work piece during the working process. It becomes an
important issue to investigate the dynamic behavior of the ball screw under the moving skew load
for developing high precision machine tools. In this project the ball screw is modeled as a
rotating shaft with simple supports and it is supported by a thrust bearing and a journal on each
side. The moving skew load consists of an axial driving force and a lateral moving force. The
system equations of motion are derived by using the Lagrangian approach. The dynamic
characteristics include natural frequencies, mode shapes and transient response. They are
obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem and using the Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, the
Floquet theory is employed to analyze the system stability for the case of a periodic moving skew
load.
Keywords : high precision machine tools, high feed drive system, thrust bearing, ball screw,

(三)報告內容
In the high feed drive system of high precision machine tools, the ball screw is one of the
most important components. It always sustains the reacting skew force of the moving working
table during the milling process. The rotating ball screw supported by journal bearings are
equipped with a hydrodynamic thrust bearing in order to balance the axial load and prevent the
axial movement. For a feed drive system, the moving table usually moves on frictional linear
guides via a servomotor with a low friction ball screw. Although it is designed to have low
3screw, the three translational displacements ( U ,V ,W ) and two rotational displacements (Β,Γ).

In Eq. (2), θ is the skew angle between the skew force and axis in OY-direction, Pa expresses
the axial force which is the horizontal component of the skew force, whereas Pl express the
lateral force which is the vertical component of the skew force. The Lagrangian approach is used
to derive the equation of system motion. It requires the formulation of the shaft kinetic energy (Ts)
and the shaft potential energy (Us). A uniform shaft with a circular cross-section is assumed in the
present study. In the condition of constant rotating speed, the equations of motion in matrix form
are derived as following.

Under the effects of parameters including the skew angle θ, the moving speed α, the rotational

Figure 5 shows the instability boundaries v.s. and . They are obtained by adopting the first
mode and the second mode at =2.5 and β=0.03. It can be found that the instability
boundaries are very close to each other. Figure 6 presents two primary instability regions v.s. 
