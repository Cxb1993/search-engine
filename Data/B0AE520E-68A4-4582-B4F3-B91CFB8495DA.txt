Abstract
In this research project, we proposed to utilize the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)
technology to design and implement a three-dimensional trademark retrieval system. This project
focuses our research effort on Multiple-Query and its applications and applies the Multiple-Query
scheme on three-dimensional trademark retrieval problem. Multiple-Query has support flexibility
and plenty important information than single-query. A set of three-dimensional trademark images
which obtained from the website of Intellectual Property Bureau, Ministry of Economic Affairs,
R.O.C. and used as the benchmark set for verifying the retrieval system. This project can reduce
different angles measure inaccuracy, increase the precision of the retrieval and trademark
registration management, three-dimensional trademark should establish digital three-dimensional
image. Besides, the proposed approach can be applied to stereo trademark and stereo image
retrieval problem and all the research results of this project will be distributed.
Key words: Content-Based Image Retrieval, Multiple-Query, Three-Dimensional Trademark,
Stereo Image, Similarity Measurement

4. Brief summary and further comments for the author(s) if any for improvement of the paper. 
(Use a separate sheet if necessary) 
 
The authors proposed a new auto-focusing mechanism which uses the image sensor directly for 
measuring and estimating the focal distance. The experimental results are promising.

and DCT have an inseparable relation. The number of the
components after DCT is numerous and has to be further
marshal.
B. Standard Deviation
The STD is a measurement concept which is used to
observe the spread of one data set from the mean value. To
understand this concept of STD, the larger STD shows that
the most numbers are far apart form mean in the data set.
Comparatively, the smaller STD describes the numbers are
relatively close to mean in the data set [7]. It can be used to
compare between the ranges of the data sets when the mean
values of the data sets are equal. For instance, the following
two sets are  26,10,8,5,1 and  10,10,10,10,10 ,
respectively. The mean values of two sets are 10 identically,
but the first has the larger STD which spreads out more
clearly [7]. Accordingly, the STD can represent the spread
degree of the observed data. It is usually accepted in some
appraisal because it is easily used to calculate.
III. AUTO-FOCUSING MEASURE OF ROI
Figure 1 presents the proposed Auto-Focusing Measure
of ROI (AFMR) based on DCT, which is used to analyze
the features of ROI. For a given scene, we will first fix the
shutter speed and iris value, then capture series of pictures
with different focal distance. The ROI region is selected by
users. Each ROI is cut into several ji sub-regions. The
important Focus Value ( FV ) of sub-regions is acquired
through DCT. Finally, auto-focusing measurement will
base on the maximum on FV . The following subsections
introduce the details.
A. Pre-processing
There are totally m images. Each image has the same
scene including ten chairs and with different focal distance.
The proposed mechanism will pick out the best in-focus
image for each ROI. Let image denote the image
database of this paper, shown as Eq. 1.
 mtok;kimageimage 1for  (1)
B. Opting the ROI
The user can select the interesting region of each image
in this paper. The black rectangle marks the ROI in Fig. 2.
Let M denote the interesting region of users in the image.
The size of M is 21 bb  .
C. Cutting the Several Sub-regions
M is segmented into ji sub-regions. The size of
each sub-region is aa , where i and j are
a
b1
and
a
b2
respectively. 1b and 2b are the size of M. The size
a is an influence factor of performance of auto-focusing.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents the results of the proposed
mechanism. Our experiment has 57 images in the image
database, which are captured by the different focal distance.
The Image-1 has the shortest focal distance and the
Image-57 has the longest focal distance. Each image
contains ten objects with different depths. All the images
are taken by Canon EOS-1Ds with dimensions
27044064 pixels. Fig. 6 illustrates an example image in
database. Regarding experiment environment, it was as
follow. The hardware was Inter Core2 Quad Q8200 CPU
and 2.00GB RAM, running Microsoft Windows XP. All
programs were implemented in MATLAB 2009b.
The first experiment presents a realistic example of the
proposed auto-focusing mechanism in Table I with the
88 region size. The small black rectangles are the best
focus regions. In this realistic example, the FVI _ of
ROI labeled 1/2/3 are 287/275/213, respectively. That
means the first image has more detail information than
others two. The second experiment shows the experiment
results of the five different ROIs with the region size,
showing the FVI _ of each image in the proposed
mechanism, as shown in Table II. For instance, the best
focusing image of ROI-5 is Image-39 and the FVI _ is
97 in the fifth row and the third column. These five ROI
of chairs are arranged from near to far. The best focus
image are Image-22 for the first, Image-25 for the second,
Image-31 for the third, Image-34 for the fourth, and
Image-39 for the fifth. The chairs of ROI are selected from
near to far. Also the in-focus image number is increasing.
That is comfort to the image captured condition that is
image has shortest focal distance with smaller image
number. Observing all the image, the selected image by our
method is also the best in-focus image.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a new auto-focusing mechanism for
the digital camera images. And the experimental results
also demonstrated the proposed mechanism can select the
best focus image. However, the size of sub-region in ROI is
