Abstract:
The finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is useful to analyze the propagation of
theelectromagnetic wave. In FDTD method, Maxwel’s curl equations are discretized by utilizing 
central-difference equations with second-order accuracy, and the electric and magnetic field
components are located at the suitable positions on the Yee cell. Since the cell size is restricted by
the size of the smallest object in the computation domain and the maximum temporal increment
is limited by the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) stability condition, the simulation of the model
with fine components can cost enormous memory and computation resources.
The temporal increment is free of the CFL stability condition and the computational domain
can be discretized in non-uniform mesh distribution using the alternating-direction implicit
FDTD (ADI-FDTD) method, but the numerical error grows with the increase of the temporal
increment. By coupling wave-envelope technique with the ADI-FDTD method, it is found that
the envelope ADI-FDTD method in two- and three-dimensional domains maintain good
numerical accuracy for a large temporal increment. In this report, the numerical performances of
the envelope ADI-FDTD and ADI-FDTD methods are discussed. A two-dimensional scattering
model and a three-dimensional cavity model were also solved by the envelope ADI-FDTD,
ADI-FDTD, and FDTD methods, and the solutions showed the good performance of the envelope
ADI-FDTD method in this report.
Keywords:

2expanded in Cartesian coordinate and performed twelve differential equations. Following the
FDTD method and ADI technique, the electromagnetic-field components are distributed in
graded meshes as shown in Fig. 1, and the process of updating the electromagnetic-field
components in a time step in the FDTD method are divided into two half-time steps. In the first
half-time step, the formulations which discretized in temporal and spatial domain are given in the
first procedure, and the formulations in the second half-time step are given in the second
procedure. These updating procedures at each time step are shown as

In these half-time steps, the implicit formulations can be solved with a tridiagonal matrix [3]. At
the conclusion of the simulation, the wave envelope is modulated by the carrier to obtain the
actual wave propagation.

Fig. 4. 2-D scattering model with a PEC cylinder.
Fig. 4 shows a scattering model with a PEC cylinder in space and 30 layers of the PML
absorbing medium imposed in the outer space. The model was simulated for the ADI-FDTD and
envelope ADI-FDTD methods. After finishing eighteen-periods of simulation, the average
amplitudes in the final three periods at observation points were recorded and could be compared
with the analytical solution [13]. The cell sizes of x and y in this model are as follows: 6 mm
in the segments A and C, and 3 mm in the segment B. In model B and C, the CPU time for the
envelope ADI-FDTD method is about two times of the CPU time for the ADI-FDTD method. The
reason is the electromagnetic-field components in the ADI-FDTD method were modeled in real
number, and the components in the envelope ADI-FDTD method were simulated in complex
6The specifications of the structure are shown in Fig. 5. The thicknesses of the two fins are
0.15 mm. A Gaussian pulse with bandwidth 8 GHz modulated with a carrier frequency of 54 GHz
was introduced, and this problem was solved by using the ADI-FDTD, the envelope ADI-FDTD,
and the traditional FDTD methods. The mesh size in y direction is uniform and in x, z directions
are non-uniform. The mesh distribution near the PEC fin is shown in Fig. 6, and the definition of
the mesh size in x, z directions are as follows:
0.025 mm in Segment A
0.050 mm in Segment B
0.100 mm in other mesh.
This problem was solved by the ADI-FDTD and the envelope ADI-FDTD methods in
non-uniform mesh, and was also solved by the conventional FDTD method in uniform mesh
where the cell size was 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3. Here tCFL is set as (0.025m)·10-3/(c0· 3 ). The
simulation time in the ADI-FDTD and the envelope ADI-FDTD methods is 7.698 ns, and that in
the FDTD method is 7.698 ns(1) and 15.396 ns(2). We recorded the values of Ez field at the
observation point, padded zeros of twice the simulation time were added, and applied the discrete
Fourier transform to compute the resonant frequencies of the cavity. The resonant frequencies and
CPU time for all three numerical methods are listed in Table II. Since the cavity was discretized
by a uniform fine mesh in the FDTD method, we took the results of the FDTD method as the
reference and defined the relative error as
Relative error REFREFNUM fff  (6)
where fREF was solved by the FDTD method using a dense mesh. For the first resonant frequency,
it is found that the relative error of the envelope ADI-FDTD method is always less than that of
the ADI-FDTD method with the same CPU time. The envelope ADI-FDTD method also takes
less CPU time and obtains the same value of the first resonant frequency which was solved by the
FDTD method. Besides, the numerical error of the ADI-FDTD method increases with the
temporal increment, but the envelope ADI-FDTD method always maintains good performance
even when the temporal increment is large.

Conclusions:
The numerical accuracy and efficiency of the envelope ADI-FDTD method were presented
in this report. Comparing with the ADI-FDTD method, the numerical phase velocity for the
envelope ADI-FDTD method is much more accurate than that of the ADI-FDTD method. The
National Institute of Health Neural Interfaces Conference
國立交通大學資訊工程系暨生醫工程研究所蔡德明教授
(一)參加會議經過及心得
I attended the 2008 National
Institute of Health (NIH) Neural
Interfaces Conference from June
15~18. This is a conference
mainly sponsored by NIH for NIH
grantees and their affiliates.
Therefore, more than 95% of the
attendee is from the US, with a
few international researchers
from South Korea, Canada,
Australia, and me. I am the only
researcher from Taiwan. I met
some familiar face such as Prof.
Wen Tai Liu (劉文泰教授) from
Department of Electrical
Engineering, UC Santa Cruz and
Prof. Gerry Loeb of Department
of Biomedical Engineering,
University of Southern
California.
The conference has three
full days of program with the
first focus on Deep Brain
Stimulation. There were oral
20 presentations presented by
NIH grantee, including panel
discussion, video presentation
of surgeries and therapies.
There was also a poster session
throughout the three days
conference. The second day
addresses the other neural
prosthesis work such as
functional electrical
stimulation, brain implant,
retinal research, neural
protection, and neural
regeneration work. The second
day was equally packed with oral
presentations and panel
discussion. The last day
addresses other part of the
spectrum: including virtual
reality, neural probes, sensory
feedback, prosthetic limbs, new
neural interface materials, how
to build a seamless neural
interface. All the oral
presentations were presented by
NIH grantees or invited speakers.
I must have listened to more than
sixty presentations throughout
this conference. I thoroughly
enjoyed them and learned much
through this conference.
I presented my work on
virtual channels on neural
prosthesis. It was well
received.
Since the NIH is notorious
for its low research grant
passing rate, I learned a lot of
basic from these top researchers
through their presentations.
