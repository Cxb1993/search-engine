detection algorithm that separates 
noise-corrupted pixels from noise-free 
pixels. Then, only the noise-corrupted 
pixels detected are filtered, and the 
noise-free pixels are kept untouched such 
that the image details can be better 
preserved. The new ASVC filter here 
resembles the ATM filter, but not in the 
way that the parameters are not easily 
obtained for various noise ratios. In fact, 
the ASVC filter does not need to exploit 
the threshold parameter for LUM filtering. 
Basically, the proposed adaptive LUM 
filter uses an adjustable weight to best 
balance the tradeoff between impulse 
noise suppression and image detail 
preservation. A scalar quantizer (SQ) 
method and a learning approach based on 
the LMS algorithm are employed to obtain 
the optimal weight for each block 
independently (Kotropoulos & Pitas, 1996; 
Ohno & Sakai, 2001). With this new 
filtering framework, the proposed ASVC 
filter can perform significantly better than 
other median-based filters in terms of both 
noise suppression and detail preservation. 
Furthermore, the new filter also shows its 
excellent robustness at different impulsive 
ratios. 
 
二、支撐向量機法(SVMs)：  
Support vector machines (SVMs) 
have been recently proposed as new kinds 
of feedforward networks for pattern 
recognition because of their high 
generalization capability without priori 
knowledge (Haykin, 1999; Vapnik, 1995, 
1998). Based on the structure risk 
minimization, the support vector machine 
is a classifier used to find the hyperplane 
that maximizes the margin between 
classes. Without loss of generality, the 
theory of SVMs can be illustrated through 
a two-class classification problem. In this 
work, the SVM technique will be 
employed to classify a signal as either 
noise-corrupted or noise-free. 
Let },,1),,{( Niyx ii L=  be a 
training data set of N  data points, where 
n
i Rx ∈  and }.1,1{−∈iy  The training 
goal of the SVM is to find an optimal 
hyperplane that maximally separates of 
training data set Into two classes. The 
margin can be seen as a measure of the 
generalization ability; that is, the larger 
the margin, the better the generalization 
expected (Vapnik, 1995, 1998). The 
optimization problems in linearly 
inseparable and nonlinearly inseparable 
cases are discussed as follows [Cristianini 
& Shawe-Taylor, 2000]. 
For the linearly inseparable case, the 
optimal classification hyperplane is found 
by solving the following quadratic 
programming (QP) problem:

where W  is a weight vector, iξ  is a 
non-negative variable, b  is a bias of 
hyperplane and C  is a predefined 
positive constant. The optimization 
problem (2.1) can be rewritten as

For the nonlinearly inseparable case, 
the original data is projected into a certain 
high dimensional Euclidean space H  by 
 4
)(kx may be corrupted by impulsive noise. 
Most impulsive noise can be detected by 
using the variable )(kc  as an indicator. If 
we only take the )(kc  value to judge 
whether impulsive noise exists, then it is 
difficult to fully separate impulsive noise. 
For example, line components and edges 
are usually present in an image; therefore, 
if )(kx  is located on a line or an edge, it 
may be mistakenly interpreted as 
impulsive noise and be removed. To avoid 
wrong judgments, it is necessary to add 
other observations to it to improve the 
correctness. Therefore, we decide to take 
in two extra variables )(kl  and ).(ke   
Definition 2: 
)}(,),(),(,),({)( 1010 kxkxwkxkxMEDkc Nnn

Definition 3: )()()( 3 kckxkl −= .   
Definition 4: )()()( 5 kckxke −= .   
If the variable )(kl  is applied, then a 
pixel on an edge component in the filter 
window }{kw  will not be detected as 
noise because of the small )(kl  value. In 
addition, if the variable )(ke  is applied, 
then a pixel on a line component in the 
filter window }{kw  will not be detected 
as noise because of the small )(ke  value. 
In this work, according to the above 
three feature variables )(),( klkc  and 
)(ke , the feature vectors are given by 
))(),(),((}{ keklkckf = .          (3.1) 
The feature vectors }{kf  serve as the 
input data set to the SVM impulse detector. 
This feature information will be also used 
in the filtering stage. 
3.2.2 Training the SVM classifier 
The optimal separating hyperplane 
can be obtained through a training process 
by using a set of supervised class labels 
for the training corrupted image. The 
input in the training process is the set of 
unsupervised features }.{kf Figure 2 
shows the feedforward network 
architecture of the SVM impulse detector 
that identifies noise-free pixels and noise- 
corrupted pixels. This efficient design can 
minimize the risks of misclassification not 
only in the training set (i.e. training errors) 
but also in the test set (i.e. generalization 
errors). 
3.3 Adaptive weight of the LUM filter 
The adaptive weight l  can help the 
LUM filter perform different degrees of 
noise suppression and image detail 
preservation. To decide the adaptive 
weight l , the weight controller, namely 
the switching scheme shown in Fig. 3,  is 
proposed in this work. Note that )(⋅d  
shown in Fig. 3, which is defined as a 
function of the feature vector, is a 
classifier to determine the partitioning, 
and },,2,1{),( Miki L∈β  serves as the 
adaptive weight l  for the LUM filter. We 
use the scalar quantization (SQ) method to 
partition the feature vector space into M  
blocks, and a LMS learning algorithm is 
also used to set the weight for each block 
so that the mean square error of the filter 
output can be minimized.

3.4 Noise Filtering 
The noise filtering of the ASVC filter 
is a combination of LUM filtering and 
adaptive LUM filtering as shown in Fig. 
1. 
3.4.1 LUM filtering 
Firstly, if the input pixel is classified 
as impulse noise by the SVM impulse 
detector, the LUM filter is activated and it 
is replaced. Otherwise, the identity filter 
(no filtering) comes in to preserve the 
original intensity. Note that the inputs to 
the LUM filter here are selected from only 
the noise-free pixels decided by the SVM 
impulse detector within a filter window 
}.{kw  Here, to reduce the complexity, the 
weight 2/)1( += Nl  of the LUM filter 
is selected. That is, the LUM filter outputs 
the median value of those noise-free 
pixels in the filter window }.{kw  
3.4.2 Adaptive LUM filtering  
Owing to the possible mistakes the 
SVM impulse detector might make, 
undetection and mis-detection problems 
might happen with the ASVC filter. The 
undetected noisy pixels may remain in the 
restored image because the SVM impulse 
detector has not detected them to be noisy 
pixels. The mis-detected pixels, on the 
other hand, may be mistakenly modified 
by though they are good pixels. Therefore, 
to improve the performance, we 
incorporated adaptive LUM filtering in 
our ASVC filter to reduce both undetected 
and mis-detected pixels. Since the ASVC 
filter adaptively selects an optimized 
weight to carry out the filtering operation 
for each input pixel )(kx  corresponding 
to its )(kiβ  of block iΩ , better noise 
attenuation can be achieved without 
degrading the quality of the fine details.

(4.1) 
where )(ks  and )(kn represent the 
original noise-free image pixel and the 
noise substitution for the original pixel, 
respectively (Chen & Wu, 2001). There 
are two types of impulsive noise: fixed- 
valued and random-valued impulse. In 
8-bit gray-scale images, the fixed-valued 
impulse, which is also known as salt and 
pepper noise, has equal probability of 
noise intensity at 0 and 255, while the 
random-valued impulse is uniformly 
distributed over the range of [0, 255].  
In addition, 33×  filter windows are 
used in all the experiments. Notably, the 
quantization interval values employed in 
the partitioning processes are obtained 
experimentally, and [0, 2), [2, 5), [5, 15), 
[15, 35), [35, 255] for variables )(),( klkc  
and )(ke  turn out to be the satisfactory 
interval values (shown in Fig. 4) used 
throughout the experiments. 
The optimal separating hyperplane 
and optimal weight Miki ,,2,1),( L=β   
are obtained through a training image 
‘Couple’ corrupted by 20% impulse in the 
training process. Notably, the tested 
images are outside the training set so that 
the generalization capability could be tried 
out. Table 1 shows the accuracy of the 
SVM impulse detector (or SVM classifier) 
to some benchmark images corrupted by 
20% impulse noise.  
Several experiments are conducted to 
compare the new ASVC filter with the 
standard median (MED) filter, the tri-state 
median (TSM) filter (Chen, Ma, & Chen, 
1999), switching scheme I (SWM-I) (Sun 
& Neuvo, 1994), the fuzzy median (FM) 
filter (Arakawa, 1996), the partition fuzzy

Abstract—An adaptive median-type filter controlled by evidence fusion is proposed for fuzzy image restoration. The fusion of 
evidence based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, providing a way to deal with the uncertainty in the evidence fusion, 
indicates to what extent an impulsive noise is considered. The setting membership function of impulsive corruption is based on the 
belief value of the input signal sequence, and the weight is indicated for filtering operation. The efficient step-like function is used to 
partition the belief space, and the least mean square (LMS) algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal weight for each block. 
Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed filter can outperform many well-accepted median based filters in 
preserving image details while effectively suppressing impulsive noise.

where the input pixel )()( 1 kxkx n+=  is the central pixel. 
A. The Principle of the PBM Filter  
The basic structure of the proposed PBM filter based on 
the evidence sources is illustrated in Fig. 1. The output value 
)(ky  of the PBM filter with the current pixel )(kx  is 
obtained as follows: 
)),()()(()()( kfkxkkfky −+= α                            (6) 
where )(kf  denotes the median filter. Here, )(kα denotes 
the membership function indicating to what extent an 
impulsive noise is considered likely to happen at the pixel 
)(kx . If the weight )(kα can only be either 0 or 1, the filter 
corresponds to a decision-based median filters. To improve 
the filtering performance, the membership function )(kα  
should have a continuous range of value from 0 to 1 
according to fuzzy rules. To obtain the adaptive weight ),(kα  
in this work, the weight controller is proposed. 
B. The Production of the Evidence Sources and Mass 
Function Definition 
To apply the DSET, the frame of discernment includes two 
elements: noise-free )(F  and noise-corrupted ).(N Thus, the 
power set contains four elements: UNF ,,  (universe 
),FN ∪ and empty set ).(φ Therefore, there has to be a 
method to acquire the evidence and its corresponding mass 
function. In this work, the weight controller makes its 
decision on the basis of four bodies of evidences, mass 
functions, and information fusion by Dempster’s rule of 
combination. One can define the following four variables 
)(),(),( krkpkg and )(kl  according to the local information 
in the filter window to generate the bodies of evidence and 
their mass functions.

differences) statistic [13]. The noisy pixels have higher mean 
ROAD values than the uncorrupted pixels. According to 
Definition 3, the following fuzzy rule could be used to judge 
whether an impulsive noise exists or not. 
Rule C: If  )(kr  is LARGE then an impulsive noise is 
assumed present. 
Nevertheless, if )(kx  is located on the line components, 
the evidence )(kr  may be mistakenly interpreted as 
impulsive noise. To avoid wrong judgments, another variable 
)(kl  is provided, which is defined as follows [9].

If the )(kl  is applied, then the line component in the filter 
window }{kw will not be detected as noise because of the 
small )(kl . According to Definition 4, the following fuzzy 
rule could be used to judge whether an impulsive noise exists 
or not. 
Rule D: If  )(kl  is LARGE then an impulsive noise is 
assumed present. 
According to the knowledge of domain experts, Table I 
illustrates the combined decision rules according to linguistic 
variables ),(kg ),(kp )(kr and )(kl , and the action )(kα  
can take fuzzy sets {VERY HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, 
VERY LOW} of natural language as their values [9]. From 
Table I, the behaviors of the detection median filter can be 
described by means of sixteen combination fuzzy rules based

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS   
The random-valued impulse uniformly distributed over 
the range of [0, 255] is considered in 8-bit gray-scale images. 
Extensive experiments have been conducted on a variety of 
512512×  test images to evaluate the performance of the 
proposed PBM filter. In addition, 33×  filter windows were 
used in all the experiments. The peak signal-to-noise ratio 
(PSNR) has been employed to measure the restoration 
performance quantitatively, which is defined as

where 255 is the peak gray-level of the image. Larger PSNR 
values denote better image restoration. In addition, the mean 
absolute error (MAE) has also been taken as a quantitative 
measure to evaluate the levels of the edges and the details 
preserved, which is defined as

Smaller MAE values denote better image-detail preservation. 
All the weights Miki ,,2,1),( L=α  in the belief space 
could be trained independently by using Eq.(15). The optimal 
weights stayed constant during the filtering stage throughout 
the experiments. In approximating the weight function to a 
step-like function, the parameters concerning the width of 
each step such as 1−jλ  and jλ  in Fig. 3 were required; the 
axis was equally divided into piecewise regions with the 
number of blocks. Figure 4 shows the PSNR (peak 
signal-to-noise ratio) comparison results of the ‘Lena’ image 
corrupted by 20% impulsive noise when the various numbers 
of blocks were used. It can be observed from the Fig. 4 that 
the filtering performance is not so much influenced by the 
number of blocks. Therefore, 30=M  was used throughout 
the experiments. To improve the image restoration 
performance, recursive filtering, where the estimate of the 
current pixel is dependent on the filter outputs for the 
previous pixels, is implemented in the PBM filter.  
To assess the effectiveness of the new filter for different 
images, Table II presents the comparative PSNR results of 
removing 20% impulse showing how the new filter compared 
to other median-based filters. Figure 5 shows the results of 
filtering image ‘Lake’ corrupted by 20% impulse and its 
MAE value. Clearly, the PBM filter offered an excellent 
trade-off between noise attenuation and detail preservation. 
The new filter outperformed the others at all noise ratios. 
Figure 6 shows the comparative PSNR results of filtering the 
image ‘Boats’, where noise ratios switch from 5% to 50%. A 
training image ‘Couple’ with 20% noise was taken to obtain 
the weight ),(kiα independent of the actual corruption 
percentage. That is, the optimal weight )(kiα  of block iΘ  
was independent of the noise intensity in all experiments.
