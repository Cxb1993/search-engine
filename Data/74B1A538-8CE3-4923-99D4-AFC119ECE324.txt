 2
rather than the elements in the coefficient matrix. 
That is, a feasible numerical scheme should be 
established based on the eigensystem of governing 
equations to reasonably reflect the physical process. 
 
Upwind scheme has been extensively 
employed and successfully validated to solve many 
complicated physical problems [13]. It is 
constructed on the propagation of characteristic 
variables in the space-time domain where the 
propagating velocities are determined by the 
eigenvalues in the coefficient matrix. Therefore, in 
its original derivation, an upwind scheme can be 
only applicable for a hyperbolic equation system 
which possesses real eigenvalues and their 
associate eigenvectors [14-16]. Unfortunately, this 
may be not the case for the two-fluid model 
equations. In the two-fluid model equations, model 
terms accounting for the interface transportations 
are introduced to realize the physical processes [17, 
18]. These terms, including the virtual mass and 
interface pressure effects, may not guarantee to 
produce a hyperbolic system of equations [19-24]. 
To circumvent this difficulty, it is quite beneficial 
to develop a numerical solution procedure to 
calculate a system of equations regardless of its 
hyperbolicity. This purpose has been fulfilled in 
our previous work [11]. In our formulation, the 
original coefficient matrix is split into two parts: 
one with real and the other with imaginary part of 
the complex eigenvalues in the original equation 
system. It can be proved that the resulting 
eigenvectors in these two decoupled parts can be 
the same as those in the original form. The part 
with real eigenvalues can be treated as in a 
conventional upwind scheme and that with 
imaginary ones are handled by a compact 
difference approximation. That is, a conventional 
upwind scheme can be easily modified to solve the 
resulting equation system. Meanwhile, the solution 
procedure will be reduced to the conventional 
upwind scheme if the equation system becomes 
hyperbolic. Equipped with this useful methodology, 
solving general two-fluid model equations by an 
upwind scheme will become feasible even the 
equation system is non-hyperbolic. 
 
In addition to the above-mentioned equation 
hyperbolcity problem for a conventional upwind 
scheme, there remain some further obstacles needed 
to be overcome in numerical practice to solve the 
two-fluid model equations. Since different phase 
bears its own physical properties, the number of 
resulting equation system will be doubled as 
compared with the single phase circumstance. For 
example, in the one-dimensional situation, totally 
six coupled equations must be considered in the 
two-fluid model equations. It becomes very 
difficult to explicitly derive the resulting 
eigensystem for the equation system. Therefore, a 
straightforward but inefficient solution is to resort 
to call for the numerical subroutines in 
mathematical libraries for the required eigensystem 
in an upwind scheme. A lot of additional 
computational resource must be invested for this 
purpose since these eigensystem quantities are 
required at all interfaces of a computational cell. 
Such a calculation procedure will inevitably 
increase the computational load and decrease the 
solution efficiency. Meanwhile, equation 
characteristics may be concealed in the attainable 
numerical eigensystem. It will be a difficult task to 
interpret the computational results by the inherent 
characteristics in the governing equations. 
Furthermore, additional modifications must be 
considered if the equation system becomes 
degenerate. Therefore, it will be beneficial both in 
numerical and physical aspects to derive a simple 
algebraic expression for the eigensystem of two-
fluid model equations, although their explicit 
expressions are not easily attained. It is one of the 
main themes for the present study to clarify and 
resolve these issues. 
 
The objective of present work is to develop a 
feasible computational procedure for two-fluid 
model equations irrespective of its hyperbolicity. 
Besides the above introductory section, the 
remaining sections of this article are organized as 
follows. In Section 2, the considered governing 
two-fluid model equations are given with the 
virtual mass and interfacial pressure terms to 
accommodate the interface momentum transport 
between different phases, whose characteristics is 
analyzed and detailed in Section 3. A simple 
fourth-order polynomial is derived to algebraically 
determine the eigenvalues in the equation system. 
Some interesting observations are made to elucidate 
the limiting characteristics of the equation system. 
With the eigenvalues, their associate eigenvectors 
can then be appropriately expressed with some 
algebraic manipulations. The essential ingredients 
for the proposed numerical scheme are 
demonstrated in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to 
the numerical experiments including the interfacial 
problems in a Van der Waals fluid, one-
 4
)h,p( kkk ρ=ρ  (6) 
 
where the subscript k signifies that this equation 
can be applied to liquid (k=f) or gaseous (k=g) 
phase. 
 
As noted above, the governing system of 
equations (1-3) compose of continuity, momentum 
and energy equations for each phase. Only the 
interfacial transport terms containing temporal and 
spatial derivatives are retained. Terms modeled 
with algebraic expressions are not considered since 
they will not affect the equation characteristics and 
the key feature of our proposed methodology. Also, 
short-wave behavior will not be influenced by the 
omission of algebraic terms [17]. Finally, it shall be 
noted that both phases possess the same pressure in 
the above equations, which implies that the 
pressure relaxation time is much shorter than any 
time scale given in the equations. This common 
pressure assumption is valid for many practical 
two-phase flow problems and is also adopted by the 
aforementioned engineering-oriented computer 
codes [5-7]. 
 
3. Eigensystem Analysis 
For an upwind scheme, we must provide the 
eigensystem of the equation system to determine 
the numerical flux function. For clarity, governing 
equations (1-3) are rearranged as the following 
vector form to investigate its characteristics:

where v is the primitive dependent variable vector:

with superscript T indicating a matrix transposition. 
The coefficient matrices A and B can be derived by 
directly expanding Eqs. (1-3):

For these equations, rv  is the phasic velocity 
difference, 
 
fgr vvv −=  (7g) 
 
In this vector equation and all equation systems 
discussed in present article, boldface lower and 
upper case letters denote vector and matrix, 
respectively. 
 
Following the standard procedure for matrix 
computation [26], characteristics of the equation 
system (7) can be determined by solving the 
generalized eigenvalue problem, 
 
BRΛAR =  (8) 
 
where R is the eigenvector matrix which is 
composed of the right eigenvectors and Λ is a 
diagonal matrix with eigenvalues as its diagonal 
elements. Besides these two characteristic matrices, 
inverse of eigenvector matrix, 1−R , must also be 
determined to complete the numerical flux function 
in an upwind scheme.  
 
3.1 eigenvalues and hyperbolicity analysis 
From the generalized eigenvalue problem (8), 
eigenvalues can be determined based on the 
existence condition of non-trivial eigenvectors [26]: 
 
0=λ− BA  (9) 
 
where A  denotes the determinant of matrix A. By 
inserting the coefficient matrices in Eq.(7) into the 
 6
solved algebraically. Significant amount of 
computer time can be saved with this substitution. 
Physically, it will reveal important information to 
check equation hyperbolicity, even though it is 
difficult to derive general necessary criteria. For 
example, by carefully inspecting this equation, one 
can find that the hyperbolicity is independent of the 
arithmetic average velocity ( v ) and, with given 
model constants, depends only on void fraction 
( fα ), phasic density ratio ( fg /ρρ ), sound speed 
ratio ( fg c/c ) and dimensionless phasic velocity 
difference ( mr c/v ). It can also be proved that if z 
is a root of characteristic equation, 0)z(Pch =  with 
rv , then –z will be a root with rv− . These 
observations can be used to simplify the parametric 
study for equation hyperbolicity. That is, equation 
characteristics can be analytically studied with this 
characteristic equation instead of the more 
complicated 66×  coefficient matrix. For example, 
from this characteristic equation, we can easily 
deduce the following interesting conclusions:

One can easily prove that the equation system 
(7) will become hyperbolic if 
 
m

r c2v ρρ
ρρ>  (14) 
 
That is, if the phasic velocity difference is 
twice larger than the mixture sound speed, the 
equation system will possess all real 
eigenvalues. However, in a practical flow 
problem, this condition is seldom satisfied. 
Therefore, one should include interfacial 
momentum transport in the governing 
equation to obtain a hyperbolic system of 
equations. 
 
 (2) single phase limit 
Since the model constants may be 
dependent on the void fraction, we should 
expand these constants as well as the 
characteristic equation with respect to gα  to 
investigate equation characteristics at the 
single phase limit. 
 
...CCC 1,vmg0,vmvm +α+=  (15a) 
 
...1g0 +σα+σ=σ  (15b) 
 
...1,ig0,ii +δα+δ=δ  (15c) 
 
Substituting these relations into the 
characteristic equation and manipulating with 
simple perturbation theory, we can find the 
zeroth-order eigenvalues at the single phase 
limit, 0g =α ,

ff0,4 vc −−=λ  (16d) 
 
The first and last eigenvalues are related to 
the physically realistic eigenvalues in the 
single phase situation; while, the other two 
eigenvalues are the spurious ones for the 
diminished phase. If we impose an additional 
constraint that the eigenvalues in the single 
phase limit should be independent of the 
adopted model constants, then the model 
constant σ  should satisfy the following end 
condition, 
 
1=σ  for 0g =α  (17a) 
 
For the other extreme situation of 0f =α , a 
similar argument will lead to, 
 
1−=σ  for 0f =α  (17b) 
 
These end conditions have also been proposed 
by Drew [3] and employed by Drew et. al. [19] 
 8
hyperbolic equation system in this 
circumstance is: 
 
0v >Δ  (21b) 
 
For system without interfacial momentum 
transport, 0C ivm =δ=σ= , the determinant 
becomes: 
 
gfgfv 4 ρραα−=Δ  (21c) 
 
which implies a non-hyperbolic equation 
system. This observation is consistent with 
the analysis in the previous section. 
Furthermore, from the approximate 
characteristics given above, we can define the 
mixture sound speed as: 
 
gf
2
mvm
pm
2
mvm
m C
C
cc ρρ+ρ
ρρ+ρ=  (22) 
 
Obviously, the mixture sound speed is 
affected by the model virtual mass term and is 
independent of the interfacial pressure term. 
Thus, determination of vmC  can be verified 
by the mixture sound speed. For instance, it is 
the sound speed for stratified flow when 
0Cvm = , which results in gfpmmst /cc ρρρρ= ; 
however, the equilibrium sound speed can be 
obtained with ∞=vmC , meq cc = . Finally, it is 
also worth noting that the approximate 
eigenvalues shown in Eq.(20) in the 
incompressible limit is not affected by the 
model interfacial pressure term. Eigenvalues 
incorporated the ones with the mixture sound 
speed ( 1λ  and 4λ ) will remain real in the 
incompressible limit. 
 
Most of the above observations have been revealed 
in the existing literature [3, 4]; however, a much 
simpler analysis can be attained with the equivalent 
characteristic equation. The above three special 
cases are studied by perturbation theory since they 
are practically useful. Other flow parameters such 
as density ratio, ( fg /ρρ ), and sound speed ratio, 
( fg c/c ), can be studied in their limiting 
circumstances with the similar procedure. 
 
Since the characteristic equation (10) involves 
a fourth-order polynomial, there may exist two 
complex eigenvaule pairs as its roots. However, 
from the analysis of system without interfacial 
momentum transport, the characteristic polynomial 
becomes negative for 2/vz r= . That is, there at 
most exists one pair of complex eigenvalues in this 
circumstance. With this understanding, it is 
reasonable to speculate that this is may be also the 
case for the equation system with additional 
interfacial momentum transport terms since these 
terms are introduced to hyperbolize the equation 
system [27]. This speculation can be verified by 
directly evaluating the characteristic polynomial, 
)z(Pch . Figures 1a and 1b are the normalized values 
of characteristic polynomial for 3.0c/vr =  and 0.5, 
respectively. In these figures, the other parameters 
in the characteristic equation are assigned as: 1f =ρ , 
3
g 10
−=ρ , 5cf = , 1cg =  and 5.0f =α . Effects of 
added interfacial momentum transport terms are 
clearly shown in these figures. It is evident that the 
additional terms will hyperbolize the equation 
system since all the six roots in the characteristic 
equation become real. Nevertheless, it is 
impractical to check equation hyperbolicity for all 
possible flow region and model constants. Rigid 
proof can not be offered through numerical tests. 
However, in all the interested cases we have tested, 
there indeed exists at most one pair of complex 
roots in the characteristic equation. This fact can 
significantly simplify the numerical procedure in 
our proposed scheme. Meanwhile, analyses for the 
cases of incompressible and single limits are also 
quite helpful in numerical procedure because the 
equation system may become degenerate due to the 
occurrence of double eigenvalues. These 
advantages will become more obvious in describing 
the detailed procedure of our proposed numerical 
method. 
 
3.2 eigenvector matrix 
For an upwind scheme to simulate equation 
system, eigenvectors must be supplied to determine 
the numerical flux function. If eigenvalues for the 
equation system have been obtained from the 
characteristic equation (10), we can acquire their 
corresponding eigenvectors in the generalized 
eigenvalue problem (8). According to eigenvalue 
problem theory [26], the associate eigenvector for 
any eigenvalue of multiplicity one can be derived 
by deleting a redundant equation from the linear 
equation system, which in our case results in five 
independent equations. For convenience, we retain 
the phasic mass, mixture momentum and phasic 
 10
 
ff4 cv −=λ  (26c) 
 
5λ  and 6λ  are shown in Eq.(11) and do not impose 
any further difficulty because their corresponding 
eigenvectors illustrated in Eq.(24) are independent 
of the others. Therefore, it is the eigenvectors 
associate with multiple eigenvalues 2λ  and 3λ  
make the original derived eigenvector matrix (23) 
singular. To correct this deficiency, we rearrange 
the resulting eigen-problem by the following form: 
 
0

1r =−ρ+ rrr

5
1 rr ρ=  
 
2
f
6
1 rr ρ=  
 
where kr  denotes the k-th component in the 
associate eigenvector, r. From these relations, one 
can derive an additional constraint imposed on the 
model constants to avoid a trivial eigenvector: 
 
2r

The other four eigenvectors can be determined 
from the original formulation. Similar results can 
be obtained for another single phase situation for 
1g =α . 
 
For the case of equal phasic velocities 
( 0vr = ), these exists a eigenvaule of multiplicity 4 
( gf6532 vv ==λ=λ=λ=λ ) which can be directly 
determined from Eq.(20). The resulting coefficient 
matrix in the eigen-problem becomes:

This related coefficient matrix clearly shows the 
equation system becomes degenerate because its 
rank is 3 instead of 2. The coefficient matrices, A 
and B, can not expressed by the generalized eigen-
problem given in Eq.(8). They should be 
decomposed into the Jordan form to achieve the 
canonical expression [26]:

All eigenvectors except 3R  can be obtained from 
the original derivation in Eqs.(23) and (24). 
According to Jordan decomposition, we can 
determine the remaining eigenvector, 3R , by the 
following relation:

As compared with the original eigenvector for 
Eq.(8), this expression explicitly involves model 
virtual mass term for interfacial momentum 
transport. Therefore, it must be modified according 
to the adopted model terms. The other two 
eigenvectors arising from the apparent eigenvalues 
illustrated in Eqs.(10a) and (11) can be determined 
by directly inspecting the generalized eigen-
problem (33a): 
 
( )T5 0,1,0,0,0,0=Q   for g5 v=λ  (35a) 
 
and 
 
( )T6 1,0,0,0,0,0=Q   for f6 v=λ  (35b) 
 
These two eigenvectors are the same as those in 
original eigen-problem given in Eq.(24) and 
independent of the other four eigenvectors 
associate with eigenvalues derived from 
characteristic equation (12). 
 
It should be further emphasized that the 
derived algebraic expression for eigenvector in 
Eq.(34) is only applicable for eigenvalue with 
multiplicity one. As mentioned before, eigenvector 
associate with multiple eigenvalues must be 
modified to avoid a singular eigenvector matrix. In 
the case of single phase with 1f =α , we have the 
following relations derived from Eq.(33a):

It is noted that the model constant iδ  satisfies the 
relation given in Eq.(27) to avoid the occurrence of 
trivial eigenvectors. 
 
As discussed before, the equation system will 
become degenerate in the case of equal phasic 
velocities ( 0vr = ). The associate eigenvector

where v is the solution vector in real space, NR∈v  
(N is the total number of dependent variables), and 
C is a non-defective real coefficient matrix, 
NNR ×∈C , which can be diagonalized with non-
singular matrices, L and R: 
 
LΛRC =  (41a) 
 
where R and L are the matrix consisted of right and 
left eigenvectors, respectively. 
 
ILR =  (41b) 
 
where I is the identity matrix. In equation (41a), Λ  
is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues as its 
diagonal elements. Compared with the coefficient 
matrices of the present governing equations shown 
in Eq.(7a), the resulting coefficient matrix, C, can 
be derived as: 
 
ABC 1−=  (42) 
 
For a general coefficient matrix, its associate 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors may contain complex 
quantities: 
 
IR iΛΛΛ +=  (43a) 
 
and 
 
IR iRRR +=  (43b) 
 
IR iLLL +=  (43c) 
 
where subscripts R and I denote the real and 
imagery parts of a complex quantity, respectively. 
The unit imagery number is represented by i, 
1i2 −= . The key idea of handling the non-
hyperbolic system is to split the coefficient matrix 
into two parts: one with real eigenvalues and the 
other with pure imagery ones: 
 
ir CCC +=  (44a) 
 
where rC  contains real eigenvalues and iC  pure 
imagery ones. With this decomposition, we can 
construct the upwind scheme for the original 
equation system without difficulty. Meanwhile, for 
an originally hyperbolic system, the part with pure 
imagery eigenvalues, iC , will be vanished. 
Therefore, the proposed methodology will be 
applicable irrespective of equation hyperbolicity. 
 
The decomposition in Eq.(44a) can be 
fulfilled if the original eigensystem shown in 
Eq.(41a) is constructed to satisfy the following 
simple rules [11]: 
 
(i) if iλ  is real, then its associate 
eigenvector, ir , is real. 
(ii) if iλ  is complex and its complex 
conjugate, iλ , is also an eigenvalue 
which can be denoted as jλ , then their 
associate eigenvectors are also 
complex conjugate, ij rr = . 
 
The split coefficient matrices can be found as: 
 
 
LΛRC ~~ Rr =  (44b) 
 
and 
 
LTΛRC ~~ Ii =  (44c) 
 
with the following pseudo-eigenvector matrices: 
 
IR
~ RRR −=  (44d) 
 
and 
 
IR
~ LLL +=  (44e) 
 
One can easily prove that these two pseudo-
matrices satisfy the following relation: 
 
IRL =~~  (44f) 
 
The transform matrix, T, given in Eq.(44c) is 
defined as: 
 
(i) If iλ  is real, then )i()i( IT = ; 
(ii) If iλ  is complex and jλ  is its conjugate 
eigenvalue, then )j()i( IT = . 
 
where superscript (i) denotes the i-th column of a 
matrix. That is, imposition of matrix T will perform 
an operation of column or row exchange. With 
these definitions, we can prove the relation given in 
Eq.(44a) as well as the following relations:

Advantages of these expressions have been 
discussed in our previous work [11].  
 
As one can easily see, the present scheme is 
analogous to that for hyperbolic equation system 
[37]. Only the eigensystem matrices in the 
numerical flux function need to be modified. 
Meanwhile, the proposed numerical flux function 
will reduced to the conventional upwind flux if the 
equation system is hyperbolic. That is, the original 
benefits from the conventional upwind differencing 
will be preserved to handle the non-hyperbolic 
system. For a degenerate system with multiple 
eigenvalues, similar treatments can be obtained and 
had been shown in our previous work [11] where 
more detailed discussions are also presented. 
 
4.3 mixed variables 
In our above analyses on solution 
characteristics, we employed the primitive variables 
to derive the eigensystem for the equation system. 
It is well known that using primitive variables as 
calculation variables will lead to the incorrect 
prediction of wave propagation phenomena. This 
deficiency also emerges from the calculations of a 
conservation hyperbolic equation system [29]. 
Therefore, it is suggested to adopt the conserved 
variables, 
 
T

)h,h,v
,vv,,(
ραραρα

to calculate a conservative equation system for 
multi-component fluids. However, the model two-
phase equations can not be expressed as a 
conservation laws due to interfacial momentum 
transport terms. Spurious oscillation in calculated 
pressure near regions with steep change of void 
fraction will occur if conserved variables are 
adopted. This phenomenon had been carefully 
studied by researchers and had been attributed to 
the characteristics of interface propagation [28-30]. 
To alleviate above disadvantages, one can adopt 
mixed variables to calculate two-phase model 
equations, 
 
T

These variables incorporate conserved ones for 
mass and energy equations; while primitive ones 
for momentum equations which can not expressed 
with conservative form. The governing equation 
system (7) with primitive variables can be mapped 
into those with mixed variables with simple 
variable transformation:

5. Numerical Validations 
To validate our proposed numerical scheme 
for a non-hyperbolic equation system, we perform 
some numerical tests on two-phase flow problems. 
Three categories of test examples are considered in 
the present work.  
 
5.1 interfacial problems in a van der Waals fluid 
To effectively demonstrate the ability of our 
proposed methodology to solve non-hyperbolic 
equation system, we perform the one-dimensional 
calculations on interfacial problems of a simplified 
isothermal van der Waals fluid. This is a single 
component two-phase problem. In this case, the 
governing equations can be expressed by 
conservation laws of mass and momentum: 
 
0

=∂
∂+∂
∂ fu  (58a) 
 
with the following solution and flux function 
vectors: 
 
T)v,( ρρ=u  (58b) 
 
and 
 
T2 )pv,v( +ρρ=f  (58c) 
 
The van der Waals fluid is described by the 
following equation of state: 
 
2a
b1
RTp ρ−ρ−
ρ=  (59) 
 
where a and b are the state constants to 
accommodate the molecular effects deviating from 
an ideal gas. These constants can be determined 
from the state at critical point [25]. In the above 
equation of state, R is the particular gas constant 
and T the absolute temperature. In the present 
calculations, the state constants are assigned as: 
 
RT=1;  a=0.9  and  b=0.25 (60)  
 
which have been adopted by researchers to test the 
proposed numerical schemes [32-34]. The relation 
between pressure and density for this state equation 
is diagrammed in Fig.2. It is clearly shown that 
pressure will decrease with the increasing density 
in the region of βα ρ<ρ<ρ , where 9650.0=ρα  and 
7394.1=ρβ . This condition is determined by the 
following relation: 
 
0p =′  for αρ=ρ  and βρ=ρ  (61a) 
 
where p′  denotes pressure differentiated with 
respect to density: 
 
ρ=′ d
dpp  
 
This phenomenon ( 0p <′ ) violates general material 
behavior which leads to a negative isothermal 
compressibility. As will be shown in the equation 
characteristic analysis, the system becomes non-
hyperbolic in this region. As shown in Fig.2, there 
also demonstrates two important density values: 
5212.0=ργ  and 070.2=ρδ  which are determined 
by the following relation: 
 
)(p)(p βγ ρ=ρ  and )(p)(p αδ ρ=ρ  (61b) 
 
These parameters are of paramount importance to 
describe the characteristics of a van der Waals fluid.

As can been clearly seen from this flux function, it 
is not necessary to provide the eigen-system 
matrices to proceed with the numerical 
computations.  
 
Two shock-tube problems with interface are 
simulated to indicate the feasibility of the proposed 
methodology. All calculations were performed in 
the region of 1x0 ≤≤  with uniform grid spacing, 
005.0x =Δ  and maximum Courant number, 
5.0x/t
maxmax
=ΔΔλ=σ . The initial left and right 
states in the first shock tube problem are assigned 
as: 
 
⎩⎨
⎧ <=ρ
otherwise.)1,54.0(
125.0xfor.)1,8517.1(
)v,(  (65) 
 
That is, these states are separated by a diaphragm at 
125.0x = . Van Leer limiter function [37] is 
employed to determine the states at computational 
cell boundaries. The initial state jump in the 
problem satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot condition 
but does not form an admissible relation from 
Maxwell construction [25]. Therefore, these 
separated states can not sustain as the diaphragm is 
ruptured but will be composed of a left and a right 
running waves. Therefore, two intermediate states 
joined across an interface are formed. This 
phenomenon is different from the single phase 
situation, where only one intermediate state exists 
for system with two governing equations. The 
computational density distributions at 4.0t =  are 
displayed in Fig.3. Since it is difficult to derive the 
corresponding exact solution, a reference 
distribution based on refined grid spacing, 
0005.0x =Δ , is also illustrated for comparison. It is 
clearly shown that the present formulation can 
provide more accurate solution than the Lax-
Friedrichs scheme where the moving waves are 
heavily smeared. It should be noted that there exists 
small oscillation around the right running wave in 
the gaseous phase, which can be alleviated with 
refined grid. No significant oscillation can be 
observed in the liquid phase.  
 
The other test example chosen in this 
category are assigned with the following initial 
statues: 
 
⎩⎨
⎧ <=ρ
otherwise.)1,6667.2(
125.0xfor.)1,2222.2(
)v,(  (66) 
 
This problem is also suggested by several 
researchers [32-34] to verify the proposed 
numerical schemes. Figure 4 shows the 
computational results at 3.0t = . Two intermediate 
states joined across an interface are formed and 
produce two expansion waves. As compared with 
the Lax-Friedrichs scheme, the present formulation 
predicts more accurate result in this problem. In 
these two test examples, only one computational 
node in the non-hyperbolic region is observed by 
the present formulation. Very steep interfaces are 
illustrated in the computational results. 
 
5.2 one-dimensional two-component two-phase 
problems 
The numerical method developed in the 
present work is intended to simulate the two-
component two-phase problems. The governing 
equations, eigensystem and numerical scheme have 
been detailed in the previous sections. Several test 
examples are calculated to assess the applicability 
of the present methodology. In all test problems, 
the sound speed in liquid phase is assumed constant 
for simplicity. That is, the liquid density can be 
related to pressure in the following manner: 
 
)(cpp ref,ff
2
fref ρ−ρ=−  (67a) 
 
where the liquid sound speed, fc , is set to be 
1500(m/s). The reference pressure, refp , and 
density, ref,fρ , for liquid phase are 0.1013(MPa) 
and 900(Kg/m3), respectively. For gaseous phase, 
the equation of state is given by assuming a perfect 
gas law: 
 
ggh
1p ργ
−γ=  (67b) 
 
where γ  is the constant specific heat ratio which is 
set to be 4.1=γ  in our calculations. For the 
interfacial momentum transport terms, the model 
constant in the virtual mass term, vmC , is directly 
taken from RELAP5 program [5], 
 
 22
This is a two-phase shock-tube problem with the 
initial separating diaphragm located at the interface. 
The computational results of void fraction, pressure, 
mixture density and mixture velocity at 35.0t* =  
are shown in Figs.7a-7d, which is obtained with a 
more refined grid spacing, )m(60/1x =Δ . 
Location of interface almost remains unchanged 
since its convective velocity is much less than the 
pressure wave. The right running shock wave 
(transparent wave) in the liquid phase is much 
stronger than the left running expansion fan 
(reflective wave) in the gaseous phase. These 
phenomena can be interpreted by the relative 
impedance of wave propagation between liquid and 
gaseous phases. All computational results yield 
quite agreed distributions expected from physical 
understanding derived by the governing equations 
except there exists a severe oscillatory mixture 
velocity near the interface, which is clearly shown 
in Fig. 7d. This unpleasant phenomenon is due to 
the insufficient resolution of interface since it can 
be alleviated with a refined grid. As for the 
calculated phasic velocities, no significant 
oscillation can be observed near the interface, 
which is made evident in Fig.7e. That is, the 
possible reason for mixture velocity oscillation near 
interface is not caused by the phasic velocities. 
 
The fourth test example in this category is a 
two-phase problem with significant velocity 
difference:

3xfor)311.1,824.2,15,365,514.0,975.0(
)h,h,v,v,p,( fgfgg
 (74) 
 
This problem was raised by Toumi [15] as one of 
the benchmark problems in two-phase flow 
simulations. The computational results at 5.0t* =  
and 5t* =  are simultaneously displayed in 
Figs.8a-8d. At 5.0t* = , it can be clearly identified 
four propagating waves in the computational 
domain, especially from the mixture velocity in 
Fig.8d. No noticeable variation of void fraction 
across these waves can be observed. Such 
phenomena are consistent with reports by other 
investigations [15, 16, 39, 40] and can be 
interpreted by the characteristic analysis. Besides 
these waves, there also exists a small bump in void 
fraction near the initial separating location shown 
in Fig.8a. This is due to two slower propagation 
waves and not to spurious numerical oscillation. 
This speculation can be confirmed from the results 
at 5t* = . All the computed parameters except 
pressure illustrate an emerging intermediate state 
between these waves. Therefore, there exist six 
characteristic waves in this problem as expected 
from the characteristic analysis which can be 
clearly resolved from the present scheme. 
 
The last test case in the one-dimensional two-
component two-phase problems is the one with 
following initial distribution: 
 
⎩⎨
⎧ <

5xfor)338.1,093.3,0,0,20,25.0(
)h,h,v,v,p,( fgfgg
 (75) 
 
This is a two-component shock-tube problem with 
void fraction difference, which is also a benchmark 
problem in two-phase flow simulations [15]. It is 
noted that there does not exist any phasic velocity 
difference in the initial distribution. The 
computational results at 0.1t* =  are depicted in 
Figs.9a-9c. A right-running shock and left-running 
expansion wave are clearly shown in these figures. 
Pressure variations are also accompanied by the 
void fraction differences across these waves. These 
predicted phenomena are also evident from those 
calculated by other investigators [15, 16, 39, 40]. 
 
From the simulated results on these one-
dimensional two-phase shock-tube problems, it can 
be concluded that the present formulation is a 
feasible tool to predict two-phase flow problems 
including equal phasic velocities and single phase 
limit. Therefore, in the following section, this 
simulating methodology is employed to calculate a 
two-dimensional two-phase problem. 
 
5.3 shock across an immerged bubble 
The test example in the last category is a two-
dimensional gaseous bubble immerged in the liquid 
field experiencing a moving shock. The model

computational cell. Upwind scheme given in 
Eq.(49) is adopted to determine the numerical 
pseudo-flux function *kf  with some simple 
modification in the account of additional spatial 
dimensionality. Similar procedure to obtain 
algebraic expressions for eigensystem of equation 
system (76-80) can be derived as in the one-
dimensional case. These details are not 
demonstrated here for brevity and will be detailed 
in our forthcoming report. 
 
In the test example, the computational domain 
is chosen as 5y,x5 ≤≤− . A uniform grid of 
120120×  computational cells is adopted in the 
computational domain. The maximum Courant 
number to determine time step is chosen as:

results. The initial condition for solution vector is:

where 22 yxr += . This is a gaseous bubble 
located at coordinate origin, (0, 0), with a radius 
0.15 immerged in the liquid phase, where a right-
running shock wave will be formed owing to the 
discontinuous states across 25.0x −= . The 
computational results of velocity vector and 
pressure contour fields at various simulation times 
are illustrated in Figs.10a-10g. The original 
location of the gaseous bubble is also depicted in 
these figures. In this case, the characteristic length 
to determine the dimensionless time scale is chosen 
as the initial radius of the immerged bubble, 
L=0.15. In Fig.10a for 1.0t* = , the right-running 
shock is formed in the liquid phase and just 
impinges on the gaseous bubble. Meanwhile, a 
constant pressure intermediate state is emerging to 
separate the right-running shock and a left-running 
expansion wave. There also generates fluid motion 
in the originally quiescent liquid as the waves 
passing through. This scenery is quite typical for a 
single-phase shock-tube problem. At 2.0t* = , the 
computational results are shown in Fig.10b. The 
shock wave has impinged on the gaseous bubble 
and a refection wave is generated in front of the 
bubble. After the refection wave, the magnitude of 
velocity in liquid phase is augmented. Meanwhile, 
the strength of transparent wave in the gaseous 
bubble is significantly less than the original shock 
and refection waves. This phenomena can be 
attributed to the relative resistance, cρ , between 
gaseous and liquid phases. However, the velocity 
magnitude in the gaseous bubble is comparable to 
those in the liquid phase. Similar trends are 
observed in Figs.10c and 10d for the computational 
results at 3.0t* =  and 5.0t* = , respectively. In 
these figures, the originally generated expansion 
wave is moving away from the computational 
domain and a local low pressure region is 
developed around the gaseous bubble. That is, the 
shock wave in the liquid phase is significantly 
retarded by the existence of the gaseous bubble. At 
7.0t* = , the computational results shown in 
Fig.10e clearly demonstrates that the shock wave 
has passed through the gaseous bubble with 
significantly weakened strength. The internal 
generated wave in the bubble due to the shock 
wave has impinged on the perimeter of bubble and 
a reflection wave is clearly observed from the 
velocity field in the bubble. After the shock passing 
by, the pressure field near the bubble gradually 
recovers its magnitude. This phenomenon can be 
observed in Fig.10f for the computational results at 
9.0t =  since the pressure contour is shrinking 
toward the gaseous bubble. The detailed flow 
structure at 9.0t =  is shown in Fig.10g for a closer 
view. It is interesting to observe that the gaseous 
bubble behaves like a flow sink which attract the 
liquid mass. In this figure, contour of void fraction 
is also displayed to depict the location of gaseous 
bubble. As compared with the original location, the
