Abstract 
In the goal of this project, we focus on 
the application of IVC (Inter-Vehicle 
Communication) where we propose the 
geocast routing protocol for the 
real-time interactive multimedia 
transmission such the routing protocol 
can meet the requirement of the short 
response time for the interaction 
multimedia. We realize the algorithms 
proposed in our project on the real 
electric vehicles to provide a real 
application of the mobile KTV and to 
observe the differences between 
research results and real applications. 
二、計畫的緣由與目的 
隨著無線區域網路技術的進步，
許多關於無線區域網路的應用也越來
越普及。尤其是 IEEE 802.15.1/藍芽
（Bluetooth）、 IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee
等無線通訊標準的提出與發展，讓無
線網路裝置能在不具基礎架構的
(uninfrastructure)環境下，隨意連結形
成無基礎架構下的無線隨意網路
(Mobile Ad Hoc Wireless Network, 
MANET) ，因此以無線隨意網路所發
展的應用成為近年來被熱烈討論的研
究課題。另一方面也由於資訊科技與
通訊科技的進步，使得車載隨意網路
(Vehicular Ad Hoc Wireless Network, 
VANET)成為整合資訊與通訊為主軸
的一個新的研究課題。行動車輛經由
車上的 OBU(On-board Unit)連結一車
載隨意網路，將可使車輛在行進間，
與同行車輛進行即時無線通訊，也可
以 經 由 車 載 隨 意 網 路 ， 從
RSU(Road-side Unit)得知道路系統目
前的路況資訊與安全性警示，以提昇
道路行駛資訊、改善交通效能、娛樂
性與安全性的便利使用環境。車載車

上可能來不及通知與反應。但由於此
兩種應用在資料通訊的位置上有其地
緣的特性，如安全性事件的發生地
點，互動式影音資料群播傳播範圍
等，因此設計上，我們採用車輛間 V2V
的運作，以 Multiple Hop 的傳送方式，
將緊急事件與互動資料即時群播給週
遭的鄰近同行車輛。 
本計畫有兩個主要的研究課題：
(1.1) 行進車輛即時安全性事件資料群
播路由協定 (1.2) 行進車輛互動式影
音資料群播。 
(1.1) 行進車輛即時安全性事件資料
群播路由協定 
在 車 載 隨 意 網 路 上 的 群 播
(Geocast)與傳統的 Internet 網路上的群
播(Multicast)在功能上與做法上有其
差異。由於車輛行進間有特定的道路
軌道，因此對於車輛的安全性之群播
的對象大多有地緣關係。在車載隨意
網路上的群播大都是以某一個地理真
實區域為對象的群播，即群播的接收
者在其地理位置上有相鄰的特性。而
傳統的 Internet 網路上的群播，在接收
者之間是對於所要接收的群播訊息產
生需求，接收者可能分散在網路上的
不同位置，在地理位置上不一定存在
地緣關係。因此針對車輛行進安全緊
急事件之群播接收者的地緣關係建立
一個快速反應的群播路由協定，以利
安全事件的緊急通知是本計畫的研究
重點之一。 
過去針對車載隨意網路上的群播
路由協定被提出的方法大都延襲無線
隨意網路(MANET)的路由方法加以修
改，為對某一特定的目標區域為對象
進行路由的建立。因此路由的方法將
選擇鄰近節點中離目標區域最近的節
點為其中繼節點而建立路由，如圖 3-1
所示，當 source S 要傳送資料給
desternation D，S 將選擇距離目標最近
的鄰近節點 A 或距離目標角度最小的
節點 E 或 距離 S 最遠的節點為其中
繼節點 B 而建立路由，但這些方法並
未考量到在車載隨意網路上的節點車
輛是會快速移動的。若選擇的中繼節
點雖離目標區域近，但其行進方向若
背離目標區域，則所建立的路由將不
是一個有效率的路由路徑。 
 
圖 3-1. 
缺點： 
1. 車輛的選擇除了考量離目的區
域遠近外，車輛的移動方向亦是需要
同時考量的重要參數。 
2. 各車輛 OBU 等級各有不同，不
是每一個中繼節點都適合扮演路由器
的角色，收集相關路由資訊，並計算
出下一個中繼節點。 
3. 車道的車流密度也是選擇中繼
車輛須考量的重要參數，以避免將資
料傳送到某一區域而沒有其他車輛可
以繼續轉傳前進。 
因此我們提出適合各種車輛隨意
網路場景的有效路由方法。 
為了建立一個緊急快速反應群播
路由，以因應緊急訊息的群播，我們
將結合車輛的位置資訊、移動方向、
GIS 地圖與區域內各車道的車流密

由。 首先，對於環境場景進行初始設
定，假設車輛會行駛於單向多線道的
高速公路上，車輛依據功能可區分成
簡單廣播型車輛與路由規劃型車輛兩
類，簡單廣播型車輛不具路徑路由規
劃能力，只能單純幫忙鄰近其他車輛
或者自身將訊息以廣播的方式散佈出
去，以白色車輛表示之，而路由規劃
型車輛，具有路徑路由規劃能力，可
以進行車輛訊息傳輸路由資訊的蒐
集，可以指定接受訊息的車輛，以藍
色車輛表示，這兩類車型皆具有自身
定位的功能，能夠獲得目前車輛本身
行進的位置資訊。接著，在此將根據
前面問題描述，將演算法分成相對應
的四個步驟說明之。在現實 VANET 環
境中，因為藍色與白色兩類車輛皆隨
意行駛於同一高速道路上，所以無法
確保藍色車輛之間必定能夠直接進行
通訊，也就是藍色車輛之間可能有白
色車輛夾雜於其中，由於車輛本身功
能的不一致性，使得以傳統 CDS 方式
建構出來的結果，藍色車輛能夠正常
的決定是否成為 dominating vehicles，
但是，白色車輛則不能成為 dominating 
vehicle，因此無法產生連通的一傳輸路
徑，造成訊息連結斷裂的問題，所以，
本文提出一 weak CDS，也就是利用傳
統的 CDS 方法找出適合當 dominating 
vehicle 的藍色車輛，並且允許利用
dominating vehicles 周圍的白色車輛，
以廣播的方式幫忙轉傳訊息，以解決
訊息傳送連結斷裂的情形。 
如Fig3-7所示，假設 source vehicle 
A 要傳送訊息給 destination vehicle B，
dominating vehicle 為這些具有白色三
角形符號的藍色車輛，首先 A 車會透
過相鄰 dominating vehicle 將訊息傳遞
出去，而 dominating vehicle 會先去探
詢與鄰近的 dominating vehicles之間的
白色車輛轉傳數目，根據路由資訊選
出下一個 dominating vehicle，並且設
定廣播訊息的 TTL(Time to live)值，也
就是 TTL=白色車輛轉傳數目+1，再將
訊息傳遞出去，因此，即便下一個
dominating vehicle 不在直接通訊的範
圍內，也可透過這些具有紅色圓型符
號的白色車輛轉傳訊息，對於收到訊
息的白色車輛，會將 TTL 減 1，作修
改後，若 TTL>0 時再以廣播的方式再
將訊息擴散出去，也就是利用 TTL 值
限制廣播的範圍，中途可能經過多個
白 色 車 輛 的 轉 傳 ， 直 到 下 一 個
dominating vehicle 收到廣播訊息時，
再以前述方式持續路由，直到將訊息
廣播傳遞至 destination vehicle B 為止。 
 
四、結果與討論 
本計畫我們針對同行快速移動的
車輛，建立一個快速的反應路由，以
利同行車輛即時安全性事件資料群播

輛間 V2V 的運作，以 Multiple Hop 的
傳送方式，將緊急事件與互動資料即

此外我們也針對乘客間之即時互
動式連續影音傳送，須提供一個長時
間穩定且連續的路由路徑，以因應通
訊連線的斷裂。

Abstract With the advance of information technology and network technology, traditional 
learning differs considerably from communication methods. In light of current wireless 
communication technology, traditional learning approaches have made another 
breakthrough, which transform e-learning to m-learning, and furthermore integrate with 
Ubiquitous Computing, and establish users’ highly-interactive Ubiquitous Learning 
Environment. Traditional researches on Ubiquitous Learning Environment primarily 
focus on teaching-aid, with learning environment coverage restricted and with learning 
materials ready-made and motionless. This study aims to apply current information 
technology equipment and network technology to design and implement a Ubiquitous 
Learning Environment system framework on a “Vehicular Environment”. This system 
framework integrates the information-collecting and information-compiling functions of 
Cloud Learning as well as apply to “Bluetooth and WiFi Media Independent Handover” 
to break the limitation of traditional learning material sources. Furthermore, it not only 
expands learning environment coverage effectively but also enhances varieties of users’ 
accessibility to information, and in the meantime is applicable to promote everyone’s 
Ubiquitous life.

1 Introduction 
Recently, the rapid evolution and 
development of information technology and 
network technology has gradually increased 
people’s daily reliance on IT products, and has 
thus influenced on all aspects of modern people’s 
life. Nearly all kinds of traditional daily matters 
join on the “Future Life” ride; undoubtedly, 
traditional learning styles have accordingly 
renovated. Teaching activities used to be limited 
by classroom environment has transferred to 
e-learning, m-learning, and u-learning. 
Network application has been 
acknowledged the most efficient approach to 
deliver messages. Along with the wireless 
network development, the factor “mobile” has 
been added to everyone’s daily life, and thus 
promotes application development such as 
m-learning and m-business. The so-called 
“learning while living” style has no longer been 
desirable. With innovative technology of 
“Location-aware” and “Context-aware”, 
“Learning while Walking” has therefore been the 
latest fashion; lately all nations refer to 
Ubiquitous technology as an essential touchstone 
of national information technology. In 
Asia-pacific regions, the prospect “Ubiquitous 
Japan” will be reached by 2010; in Korea, 
operation of “IT-389 strategy” aims to help 
develop the related Ubiquitous technology 
application so as to reach the goal of U-Korea.[1] 
In 2003, among the “New Major Construction 
Projects” the Taiwan government put forward, 
“M Taiwan” stands out as the major focal point, 
aimed at enabling people to embrace 
high-quality life with information and 
communication technologies at anytime and 
anyplace, and of late “City U-life” has been in 
active operation. 
When it comes to related subjects of 
Mobile Learning and Ubiquitous Learning, all 
  13
Proceedings of 2010 Cross-Strait Conference on Information Science and Technology
recognize dangerous environments on campus. 
Following the above framework model to 
construct a ubiquitous learning environment, 
however, in some cases, it appears stretched. 
First of all, the studies of literature [3], [4] and 
[5], if the users themselves stay in a relatively 
fast-moving environment (e.g. when the users 
are taking a tour bus.), it is difficult to achieve 
location-aware by using the more economic 
RFID or infrared technologies. Second, in the 
study of literature [3], due to being the use of 
some high pricing mobile devices with the 
functions of GPS receiver and wireless network 
such as PDA and Smart-Phone, it is difficult to 
achieve universal. Furthermore, if all the 
necessary information is not only the 
streamlining content which supports teaching, 
and may be a huge all-inclusive information 
(e.g. high quality voice, digital video, or 
images), providing adequate storage and 
sufficient data transmission bandwidth would 
become an important issue when construct an 
ubiquitous learning environment. And this is 
the study of literature [4], the use of 
data-preloading to PDA, which is unable to 
meet the conditions. At last, traditionally, when 
it comes to establishing a Ubiquitous Learning 
Environment, mostly regarding teaching-aides, 
that information sources limited, coverage of 
learning environment require to be well 
planned and arranged beforehand and that no 
dynamic expansion mechanism exists for 
unscheduled cases have been overlooked. 
These are the above-mentioned studies that did 
not focus on and are required for further 
improvement. 
2.2 Innovation Research 
There is surely some consistency among 
the above references regarding technology and 
application to establish Ubiquitous Learning 
Environment. However, recently rethinking 
studies on Ubiquity and Context-Aware in 
innovative and practical perspectives has 
gradually been stressed. As the study in 
literature [7], it applied the concept of 
ubiquitous learning to a tourist industry. This 
study aimed to integrate GPS, RFID, and PDA 
to establish a personification digital mobile 
navigation concept and prototype, and it 
achieved the purposes of improving and 
enhancing the efficiency and quality of tourism. 
As another study in literature [8], it used the 
concept of “Context-aware” to enhance the 
library services. The purpose of the study was 
the use of RFID mechanism to develop a 
personalized library location information 
service system, and it would help users to 
search for the locations of the books they 
desired. 
This study will take the same innovative 
thinking as a starting point, and will propose a 
system application framework which is 
different from the previous ones. It will apply 
the ubiquitous learning environment in a 
vehicular environment. Let the users could 
obtain different situated learning information 
related to the scenery by their mobile devices 
when they take the tour bus. When the users 
leave the tour bus and take in-depth tourism, 
the users could obtain the localized attractions 
messages. For further study on the localized 
attractions messages they obtained, the mobile 
devices need to process the Media Independent 
Handover (MIH) to switch the communication 
interface to WiFi. After the MIH, the mobile 
devices can connect to sub server with larger 
bandwidth, and then they can obtain 
tourism-related information collected and 
compiled by ISIP (Cloud Services). The users 
can obtain further learning information related 
to the attraction messages they had obtained 
from the localized attractions. Thus the learning 
sources will not be limited in static information, 
which not only expands learning environment 
coverage effectively but also enhances varieties 
of users’ accessibility to information, and 
achieves the purposes of improving and 
enhancing the efficiency and quality of tourism.

(h) As the in
is faster, users’ mobile devices switch to 
the Bluetooth communication interface 
to receive broadcast messages related to 
tourism when they leave the tour bus 
and take in-depth tourism attractions. 
For further study on some messages 
related to tourism, the mobile devices 
need to process the Media Independent 
Handover (MIH) to switch the 
communication interface to WiFi. After 
the MIH, the mobile devices can 
connect to sub server with larger 
bandwidth, and then obtain 
tourism-related information collected 
and compiled by ISIP (Cloud Services). 
Thus the users can get further learning 
information related to the attractions 
within OPA. The method of MIH shown

the users could walk around in the OPA

receive the tourism-related message sent 
by “Ning-Hsia Night Market” with the 
Bluetooth broadcast mechanism. Then the 
user can obtain the dynamic stops 
information through the “Extensible 
Situated Learning Model” and the cloud 
learning mechanism of ISIP. Thus this 
system is not only expands learning 
environment coverage effectively but also 
enhances varieties of users’ accessibility 
to information, and achieves the purposes 
of improving and enhancing the efficiency 
and quality of tourism. 
4 Conclusions and Future w
The study recommends an u  
of
vative Ubiquitous Learning practice. In 
additional to containing the original notion of 
the general context-aware learning (General 
Context-aware Learning Model), it also 
mentions the “Extended Context-aware 
Learning Model”. By using OPA, HIM, and the 
clouding learning mechanism of ISIP, this study 
not only successfully designed and 
implemented a Ubiquitous Learning 
Environment system on a “Vehicular 
Environment”, but also expanded learning 
environment coverage effectively. In the 
meantime, it achieved the purposes of 
improving and enhancing the efficiency and 
quality of tourism. In conclusion, this study 
successfully implement the system in a tour bus 
simulation environment, which helps advance 
Taiwan toward the objective of U-Taiwan, and 
meanwhile points out a brand-new perspective 
of innovation and application for the following 
related researches.

identification by using the mobile phone with 
the built-in RFID. Furthermore, as this study 
aims to propose a set of innovative methods, it 
used the questionnaire to investigate and verify 
the effectiveness of structure. Thus this study 
will also focus on the uses’ feedback in the 
future research.

kinds of Network technology and 
“Context-aware” to reinforce all-around 
learning come along. Generally speaking, most 
of studies focus on issues about enhancing 
learning on campus (e.g. Smart Learning Class). 
However, the “Ubiquitous Learning 
Environment” based on Ubiquitous Computing 
should extended the applications to normal life 
such as life knowledge and information 
exchanges (e.g. Outside: Smart Learning Space). 
 In order to construct a “Ubiquitous 
Learning Environment”, the outdoor 
location-aware technology is definitely a key 
point when developing “Context-aware” 
technologies. With the users’ location 
information from GPS receiver, the learning 
system can offer different situated learning 
information. However, traditional researches on 
Ubiquitous Learning Environment primarily 
focus on teaching-aid, with learning 
environment coverage restricted and with 
learning materials ready-made and motionless. 
“Mobile Learning” emphasizes how to 
make a breakthrough on the space constraints, 
and let the users can obtain what they need 
without the space constraints. In addition to the 
element “mobility”, “Ubiquitous Learning” still 
needs to achieve the "context-aware" feature. 
Thus the information provider is able to detect 
the environment status of users, and offers the 
information and messages that the users require. 
As we use Global Positioning System (GPS) or 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to be a 
location-aware device, after the user receives 
the signal from GPS or RFID through Personal 
Digital Assistant (PDA), the learning system 
will obtain the information which stores in the 
mobile device in advance, or access the server 
through the wireless network to obtain the 
specific location information. Thus a so-called 
“Ubiquitous Learning Environment” can be 
established. Up till now there have been quite 
numerous related researches. For example: 
Literature [3] proposed the use of GPS and 
PDA to build a mobile learning environment 
which makes a breakthrough on the space 
constraints, and the mobile learning 
environment will be applied to an assisted 
leaning system of understanding historical 
monuments. Besides, Literature [4] proposed to 
use of GPS, PDA, RFID and other information 
technologies to construct a mobile English 
situated assistant learning system. For the 
purpose of location-aware, the users receive the 
signals from GPS and RFID by PDA, and then 
obtain the information which stores in the PDA 
in advance to learn English in the mobile 
English situated assistant learning system. 
Furthermore, literature [5] proposed the use of 
PDA and infra-red technology to achieve the 
purpose of context-aware, and obtain the 
information from the servers by local wireless 
network to apply to teaching aides for learning 
aquatic plants in campus. As in the study of 
literature [6], in addition to apply the 
ubiquitous learning system to the study of 
natural sciences, it extended the application to 
This study aims to design and implement a 
Ubiquitous Learning Environment system on a 
“Vehicular Environment”, and purposes to 
extend the mobile learning environment to a 
broader area. In addition to let users be able to 
obtain the situated learning information related 
to the attractions along the road, this system 
framework integrates the information-collecting 
and information-compiling functions of Cloud 
Learning as well as apply to “Bluetooth and 
WiFi Media Independent Handover(MIH)[9].” 
to break the limitation of traditional learning 
material sources. Furthermore, it not only 
expands learning environment coverage 
effectively but also enhances varieties of users’ 
accessibility to information, and achieves the 
purposes of improving and enhancing the 
efficiency and quality of tourism. In the 
meantime, it is applicable for everyone to step a 
more purposeful step towards "U Taiwan".

In this study, we will design and plan a 
framework of constructing a ubiquitous 
learning system, and apply it on a tour bus. 
Thus, the users could obtain the spots 
information and tourist attraction information 
along the road in a mobile vehicular 
environment. As we combine the mechanism of 
receiving broadcasts by Bluetooth with the 
technology of the media independent handover 
between Bluetooth and WiFi, we could 
effectively archive the extended the learning 
contents of unplanned spots by the 
information-integrated function of the ISIP, and 
increase the coverage of the ubiquitous learning 
environment dynamically. 
3.1 System Architecture 
The system planned and designed by this 
study could be divided into four parts. The first 
one is “Center Server Site (CSS)”; the second 
one is “sub Server Site (SSS)”; the third one is 
“Outside Point Area (OPA)”, and the last one is 
“Media Independent Handover (MIH)” 
between Bluetooth and WiFi. The system 
architecture shown in Figure 1, as described 
below:

3.1.1 Center Server Site (CSS) 
(a) Information & Service Integrated 
Platform (ISIP) is an 
information-and-service-integrated 
Learning”. The ISIP is set up in the tour 
bus company’s core server. In addition 
to being responsible for providing the 
user authentication and handle the 
storage static spots information, ISIP is 
also responsible for collecting and 
compiling the dynamic unplanned spots 
information required by users through 
the automated function based on 
“Clouding Computing”. It also offers 
various types of value-added services 
integrated from outside units.

when the users make requests by 
obtaining the localized attractions 
messages by their mobile devices. 
b Server Site (SSS) 
(c) The sub serve
updated the static spots information 
periodically from ISIP, and it also offers 
the user interface to let users to 
communicate with this learning system. 
) The GPS offers the location 
information about the area that the tour 
bus locates. Thus the sub server could 
switch the different spots information 
and tour information to the users 
) The tour bus built-in WiFi fu
(IEEE. 802.11G) offers the high data 
transmission rate between the users’ 
mobile devices and the sub server. 
 The external wireless network - W
- offers the connection and dynamic 
information exchanges between the sub 
server in the tour bus and the ISIP in the 
tour bus core server.

3.2 System Process Model 
 This study proposes 
the ubiquitous learning system, as "General 
Context-aware Learning Model" and "Extended 
Context-aware Learning Model", as described 
below: 
3.2.1 General
In the “General Context-aware Le
el”, ISIP will update the static spots 
information to the sub server. Thus the system 
will switch the corresponding static spots 
information based on the GPS location 
information which the tour bus locates, and the 
users can receive the static spots information by 
their mobile device. 
3.2.2 Extended Context-

mechanism to make the original ubiquitous 
learning environment on the tour bus to be able 
to expand its coverage and content dynamically, 
described as follows: 
In the OPA, the unplan
“Expended shops’ can send Bluetooth 
broadcasts, allowing users to “perceive” their 
existence. 
Even ther
unplanned expended spots or expended shops 
in ISIP, ISIP will collect and compile relative 
information, and deliver the integrated 
information back to the sub server on the tour 
bus. Thus the users are able to obtain the 
dynamic spot information which is not prepared 
in advance, and achieve to dynamically expand 
the coverage of the ubiquitous learning 
environment and strengthen the effect of 
diversified learning.
