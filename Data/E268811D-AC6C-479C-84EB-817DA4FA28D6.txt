 1. Introduction 
The ellipsometry is a noninvasive, surface-sensitive and well-developed optical method widely 
employed for characterizing the optical properties of a thin film [1,2], particularly in the 
situations of technical importance where the thickness of the thin film is smaller than the 
wavelength of light [3]. The optical properties of thin films, including the thickness and refractive 
index, can be characterized on the basis by the change in the linear polarization state of a 
monochromatic plane wave that is reflected by the surface of the test sample at an oblique 
incidence. The change in polarization state after reflection can be determined by measuring the 
ratio of the complex reflective coefficients, namely rP =|rP| exp(i Pφ ) and rS =|rS|exp(i Sφ ), of 
parallel (P) and perpendicular (S) polarized components of the monochromatic plane wave with 
respect to the incident plane using the equation

in which (|rP|, |rS|) and ( Pφ , Sφ ) are the absolute amplitude reflectance and phase shifts of rP 
and rS respectively. The angles ψ =arctan(|rP|/|rS|) and ∆ = Pφ - Sφ  are thus defined as the 
ellipsometric parameters. The change of the polarization state can be deduced from the Fresnel 
equations via the complex amplitude reflectance rP and rS, which are fully interpreted by (ψ , ∆ ) 
simultaneously. Therefore, the thickness, refractive index and extinction coefficient of the thin 
film can be calculated precisely in terms of (ψ , ∆ ) and the incident angle. 
Two different approaches, optical interferometry and ellipsometry, can be used to measure 
the thickness of a thin film in which the ellipsometry is more preferable for its capability of 
studying the properties of multi-layer thin film. To characterize the optical properties of thin film, 
an ellipsometric configuration made up of a polarizer-compensator-sample-analyzer (P-C-S-A) 
based on null detection is commonly employed [1,4]. However, due to time-consuming of null 
detection, P-C-S-A can only be used for single point detection on the test sample. To overcome 
the slow response of P-C-S-A, high speed photometric ellipsometry (PE) is developed in 
conjunction with a polarization modulation technique using a rotating polarizer or analyzer [5] or 
photoelastic modulator [6] for scanning the surface of sample under test, however, complicate 
control is required for scanning and sophisticate signal processing software is usually employed 
to generate 2-D information of the thin film from the collected single point data. On the other 
hand, 2-D scanning of the sample surface can also be implemented by heterodyne interferometric 
approach [7, 8], which provides high sensitivity and wide dynamic range for single point 
ellipsometric parameters detection based on amplitude and phase extraction with a lock-in 
amplifier. As a result, both approaches of PE and heterodyne interferometric ellipsometry are 
limited by the time required for 2-D data acquisition and become difficult to extend themselves 
into imaging ellipsometry. 
For characterizing the surface of thin film with imaging ellipsometry, Beaglehole [9] 
incidents onto a sample surface at an angle α , where the x-axis is laid on the incident plane. The 
linear polarization along this direction is denoted by the P wave. Meanwhile, the linear 
polarization along y-axis, which is perpendicular to the incident plane, is denoted by the S wave. 
The z-axis is the direction of beam propagation. After the linearly polarized laser beam is 
reflected by an isotropic thin film, the complex Fresnel reflection coefficients rP and rS with 
respect to the P and S polarizations of the incident beam are described by

If the reflected light wave passes through a QWP and a linear polarizer (LP), the output amplitude 
of the optical field EOUT becomes

are the Jones matrices of QWP and LP respectively. β  is the orientation of optical axis of QWP 
and γ  is the transmission axis of LP. Both angles are measured from x-axis. 1ϕ  and 2ϕ  are 
the phase shifts introduced by the QWP with respect to the wave polarized along the slow and 
fast axes of the QWP. nξ  is the common phase noise from the environmental disturbances. If 
the orientation of the linear polarization of incident beam is set at θ =π /4 and the transmission 
axis of LP is fixed at γ =0°, the electric field ET of the laser beam towards the CCD becomes 
ET=Eoexp(i nξ ){|rP|cos2(β )exp[i( 1ϕ + Pφ )]+|rP|sin2(β )exp[i( 2ϕ + Pφ )]

It is clearly shown by Eq. (7) that the optical waves, after passing through the optical system, is 
composed of four different plane waves that propagate in a common path and each of these 
carries a different amplitude and phase but presents with the same polarization. Therefore, the 
environmental disturbances induced in the phase shift nξ  can be cancelled due to their common 
nature. Meanwhile the amplitudes of the plane waves in Eq. (7) are a function of β  of the QWP 
and |rP|, |rS|, while the phase carried by these plane waves are a function of Pφ , Sφ  of the 
reflected P and S waves respectively. If a perfect QWP with a phase retardation of 
   3π /2≤ ∆ ≤2π  (I2-I4)≥0 and (I1-I3)≤0         (16d) 
Thus the determination of ψ  and ∆  in full dynamic range is achieved with only five image 
frames. This is one of the advantages of PM imaging ellipsometer compared with the method 
proposed by Beaglehole [9]. Simultaneously, the common factors in Eqs. (14), (15) are cancelled 
without being affected by any non-uniform response of pixels over CCD and this ensures precise 
measurement. At the same time, the effect of fluctuations in the laser intensity is also reduced. 
Thus, the sensitivity is improved significantly when carrying out 2-D measurements of (ψ ,∆ ). 
As a consequence, PM imaging ellipsometer has many advantages in terms of not only a full 
dynamic range of ellipsometry parameter measurements but also in terms of imaging capability 
due to the method’s insensitivity to laser source instability and non-uniform detector response. 
 
3. System description and measurements 
The optical arrangement of the proposed imaging ellipsometry is depicted in Fig. 1. A linearly 
polarized He-Ne laser is used in the setup where a Glan-Thompson polarizer (GTP) is adjusted to 
give maximum output intensity. A half wave plate (HWP) adjusts the linear polarization direction 
of laser beam at θ =45° so that equal amplitudes of the P and S light waves are incident on the 
sample. The diameter of laser beam is spatially expanded to 5.6 mm via a beam expander (BX) 
for the 2-D measurement. The beam divergence angle is lower than 0.01° in this arrangement. 
The reflected laser beam passes through a QWP and a LP, and then is collected by a CCD camera 
(640 x 480 pixels) for image recording. The QWP is mounted on a motorized rotation stage of 
which the rotation accuracy is better than 0.01°. Before the measurement, the orientation of 
optical axis of the QWP is calibrated using previous developed method [17,18] of which the 
uncertainty for the azimuth angle is 0.1°. The intensity images with respect to different azimuth 
angles of the QWP are then recorded by the CCD camera, and converted into a 10-bit digital data 
by the frame grabber.  
A commercially available step wafer [19] is adopted as the test sample in order to 
demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed PM imaging ellipsometer for thin film thickness 
measurement in 2-D. Using the three-phase model, the thickness of SiO2 is obtained from the 
measured 2-D ellipsometric parameters under an incidence angle α =70°. When the QWP is 
rotated at each given azimuth angle, ten images are recorded and averaged to improve the signal 
to noise ratio (SNR) of the measurements. Figures 2 to Fig.4 show the 2-D thickness 
measurements from the various areas of the step wafer. The step wafer is calibrated by the 
manufacturer [19] based on a refractive index n=3.88 and an extinction coefficient k=0.019 for 
the silicon substrate at wavelength 632.8 nm. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) are the distributions of the 
measured 2-D ellipsometric parameters ∆  and ψ , respectively, from area 6 of the calibrated 
step wafer. Table-1 shows the measured results with the calibration data for the various areas 
provided by the manufacturer. The difference between the measured data and the given data 
becomes larger as the SiO2 film becomes thinner in Table 1, this is probably due to the native 
oxidation of the thin film [20] may have increased its thickness compared to the given data. 
 
4. Error analysis 
The ellipsometer is a powerful and versatile tool for thin film thickness measurement. However, 
random fluctuations in the detected signal induce uncertainties in the measurement of ∆  and

In order to investigate more closely the measurement uncertainties, which contribute to these 
statistically independent errors, the calculations given in Eqs. (22) and (23) are based on firstly, 
the assumption that the random fluctuation ( )iδβ  at each step i equals 0.01°. Thus the averaged 
random fluctuation becomes δβ =0.01/ N  where N is the number of image frames to be 
averaged at step i. Secondly, it is based on random fluctuation in the incident intensity inIδ , 
which equals the random fluctuation of laser source at inIδ ≤ 0.02% according to the 
specification provided by manufacturer. Thus inIδ / inI ≤  0.0002/ N . Finally, it uses the 
uncertainty Iδ , which involves a random fluctuation σ j of the jth image frame following the 
relation

jσ=∑                                 (24) 
This random fluctuation includes [21] the shot noise σ sh, the camera noise σ cam and the 
quantization error σ quan   
   σ 2=σ sh2 +σ cam2 +σ quan2                            (25) 
σ sh2 is defined by the product of quantum efficiency η  of the pixel and the intensity I  of 
each frame  
σ sh2= η I                                    (26) 
where I  is assumed to be equal for the same pixel between frames. The camera noise σ cam is 
defined by 
σ cam =Iin/SNR                            (27) 
Theoretically, the maximum SNR is specified by the sum of the dark current noise and the 
electronic noise at full dynamic range. The quantization error [22] is defined by  
QWP can be written as

From Eqs. (33) and (34), it is obvious that qδ∆  is a function of ∆  and ψ  while qδψ  is 
ψ  dependent only. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively in which 
( )δ φ∆  is calibrated to 0.1°. The uncertainty δ∆ q becomes larger when ψ  approaches 0° or 
π /2, which implies that the P or S component of the laser beam is absorbed after laser beam 
interacted with the sample. A similar situation occurs with the uncertainty of qδψ  as shown in 
Fig. 9 when ψ  approaches π /2.  
 
5. Conclusions   
Theoretically, the proposed PM imaging ellipsometer for characterizing the thickness of thin film 
is based on a multiple wave-front interference. The 2-D ellipsometric parameters are determined 
by means of polarization modulation via the rotation of QWP. This arrangement is equivalent to 
PSI for a surface profile measurement in which an external reference channel with a varying 
optical path is required to shift the spatial fringes. In contrast, PM imaging ellipsometer provides 
a scheme where the reference beam coincides with the signal beam so that the reflected P wave 
and the reflected S wave are in common-path configuration. Therefore, the common background 
noise is reduced effectively, which improves the sensitivity of the ∆  measurement. Moreover, 
the surface relief of the sample induced phase change that is common to reference and signal 
beams are cancelled. In addition, the intensity ratio for the measurement of ellipsometric 
parameters by PM imaging ellipsometer is insensitive to non-uniform response of the pixels over 
the CCD. These enhance the sensitivity of thickness measurement of a test thin film. As a result, 
both PM imaging ellipsometer and PSI show the advantages in terms of insensitivity to laser 
intensity fluctuation as well. The advantage of PM imaging ellipsometer relies on the common 
phase rejection mode which is able to prevent phase noise being converted to amplitude noise 
during the thickness measurement. If we compare PM imaging ellipsometer with a conventional 
PE that based on polarization modulation, PM imaging ellipsometer is more suitable for imaging 
ellipsometry than PE because a phase lock-in amplifier is necessary in PE. This limits the 
scanning speed of image [25]. In the proposed ellipsometry, the orientation of rotated QWP that 
behind the sample in PM imaging ellipsometer avoids the possibility of disturbing the incident 
angle of laser beam onto the sample, which results in a better stability and lower systematic error 
for the thickness measurement. In conclusion, PM imaging ellipsometer integrates the features of 
PSI with PE that are able to obtain 2-D ellipsometric parameters simultaneously. Thus, the 2-D 
thin film thickness is determined precisely in near real-time. According to the analysis in 
Reference 3, the individual values |rP|2, |rS|2 are necessary for further improvement on the
