鉻及鉻合金覆層因其具高硬度、耐磨耗性及抗腐蝕性之特性，所以廣應用於精密機械
構件之表面處理。目前工業上一般對於鉻及鉻合金電鍍是以採用六價鉻為基礎鍍液，雖然
在六價鉻鍍液體系中可獲得鉻合金鍍層，但由於該體系氧化性極強，其他金屬離子與鉻離

Abstract 
The microstructures of as-plated and annealed Cr-Ni multilayers were studied. The as-plated 
multilayer was constructed of alternating layers of amorphous 150 nm Cr-rich and 
nanocrystalline 25 nm Ni-rich layers. After annealing at 400oC, aggregation of nanosized grains 
in the amorphous Cr-rich layer was observed. The multilayer is fully crystallized and shows the 
highest hardness (1050 Hv) after annealing at 550oC. This hardening mechanism is attributed to 
the presentation of fine crystalline grains and diamond membranes in the multilayer.  
 
Keywords: Cr-Ni multilayer, hardness, microstructure, annealing, hardening mechanism  
 
Owing to superior electrical, magnetic, and optical properties, multilayers (or compositional 
modulated alloys) have attracted the attention of many researchers [1-3]. Different fabrication 
methods for multilayers have been successfully applied by using physical vapor deposition [4], 
chemical vapor deposition [5], molecular beam epitaxy growth (MBE) [6], and electroplating. 
Among these types, electroplating is a promising fabrication method because of its low cost for 
production and convenient operation. Multilayers of Cu-Ni, Ni-W-P, Fe-Pt, and Co–Ni(Cu)/Cu) 
have been successfully obtained by using pulse electroplating in a single electroplating bath 
[7-10]. Based on our previous study [11], we proposed use of an electroplating bath containing 
environmentally-friendly trivalent Cr and divalent Ni ions to obtain Cr-Ni multilayers by 
pulse-electroplating. In the Cr-Ni multilayers, the nanosized thickness of amorphous Cr and 
crystalline Ni layers can be regulated with electroplating current densities and pulse periods.  
Because of the different chemical compositions and layer structures in a multilayer, phase 
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Philips Tecnai F30). The detailed preparation for 
cross-sectional TEM specimens was mentioned in the author’s previous work [16].  
Figure 1 shows the average hardness and standard deviation values of the as-plated and 
annealed Cr-Ni multilayers. The hardness of the as-plated Cr-Ni multilayer is 500 Hv and 
increases progressively to 1050 Hv with the increases in annealing temperature up to 550 oC, but 
decreases markedly to 750 Hv after annealing at 650 oC. The same annealing behavior has been 
reported with a Cr-C deposit, which was obtained from a trivalent Cr-based bath with an addition 
of formic acid shown to be a complex-former [17,18]. This implies that the hardening mechanism 
of the annealed Cr-Ni multilayer would be the same as that of the anneal-hardened Cr-C deposit. 
According to our previous study [19], we found that precipitation of diamond membranes is the 
mechanism for the significant hardness increase of an anneal-hardened Cr-C deposit. To clarify 
the hardening mechanism, microstructures of as-plated and annealed Cr-Ni multilayers were 
studied with XRD and TEM.   
Figure 2 presents the XRD spectra of as-plated and annealed Cr-Ni multilayers. From the 
results of XRD analyses, the as-plated Cr-Ni multilayer is mainly constructed from an amorphous 
structure, whereas crystalline structures were detected with the annealed Cr-Ni multilayers. The 
diffracted peaks of annealed Cr-Ni multilayers (as compared with JCPDS data which are shown 
in the bottom site of Figure 2) may be the result of the crystalline phases of Cr, Ni, Cr7Ni3, 
diamond, and carbon. This indicates that precipitation of a diamond structure would take place in 
the Cr-Ni multilayer after annealing. From the results of the hardness test, it can be reasonably 
assumed that the significant hardness increase of the annealed Cr-Ni multilayer has a strong 
relationship with the presentation of diamond structure.  
Figure 3a shows the TEM micrograph of the as-plated Cr-Ni multilayer, which is alternatively 
constructed from a 150 nm amorphous Cr-rich layer and a 25 nm nanograined Ni-rich layer. After 
annealing at 400 oC for 30 min, the interfaces between Cr- and Ni-rich layers in the multilayer 
can be clearly differentiated (see Figure 3b). Some parts in the Cr-rich layers were crystallized, 
while the structures of nanocrystalline Ni-rich layers seemed to be unchanged. The crystallized 
grains in the Cr-rich layer have a size of ca. 5 nm and tend to aggregate themselves. The results of 
Several researchers have pointed out that reduction of complex-formed Cr resulted in an 
amount of C-content in the Cr deposit [20,21]. According to our previous study [19], we found 
that numerous amorphous C membranes could be developed in Cr-C deposit during electroplating. 
Furthermore, the amorphous C membrane transforms to a crystalline diamond structure after 
annealing at a temperature higher than 500 oC. In this study, we confirm that the diamond 
membranes could also be observed in the Cr-Ni multilayer after annealing at a temperature above 
550 oC.    
To increase the hardness of a metallic component through annealing, precipitation of 
hardened phases could be the main hardening mechanism. However, the hardness could be 
decreased through grain growth and dislocation elimination during annealing at relatively high 
temperatures. In this study, we found that presentation of chromium carbides could only be 
observed in the Cr-rich phase in the multilayer annealed at 650 oC, but that the hardness is 
apparently lower than samples annealed at 550 oC. Therefore, the main hardening mechanism of 
the 550oC-annealed Cr-Ni multilayer is not the result of precipitation of chromium carbides. 
Although precipitation of diamond membranes and nanosized chromium carbides can be 
observed in the 650 oC-annealed Cr-Ni multilayer, obvious grain growth was also detected. This 
implies that the hardening mechanism of 550 oC -annealed Cr-C multilayer is attributed to 
relatively small grain size as well as precipitation of fine networks of diamond membranes.
