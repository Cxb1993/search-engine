Optical microscopy
Intestinal microvasculature plays a central role in nutrient absorption and immune response against
infections. Microscopic visualization of intestinal microvasculature under normal and pathological conditions
such as inﬂammatory bowel disease is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease.
Despite the intensive need to characterize the intestinal microstructure and vasculature in an integrated
fashion, 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of the gastrointestinal tissue is often limited by the spatial
resolution of the imaging tools. In this research, we aimed to apply optical clearing to minimize the random
light scattering in the mouse ileum, thereby facilitating photon penetration for high-resolution, 3D optical
microscopy of the tissue network without microtome sectioning. We applied cardiac perfusion of lipophilic
dialkylcarbocyanine dye DiD (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate) to label
the mouse blood vessels, including the intestinal microvasculature. The labeled and paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed
ileum was immersed in the aqueous optical-clearing solution to improve photon penetration. Optical
clearing revealed the interior domain of the mouse ileal mucosa and submucosa, where random light
scattering was suppressed and the size of the microstructure in the ﬁxed specimen remained the same. Using
ﬂuorescent labeling, the intestinal microstructure and vasculature were simultaneously imaged by 3D
confocal microscopy to allow for an integrated visualization of the tissue network with high deﬁnition. This
new optical approach provides a useful tool for 3D presentation and analysis of the microvasculature for
better understanding the intestinal physiology.

Introduction
Detailed morphological analysis of the gastrointestinal vasculature
is greatly needed in the basic and clinical research. However,
visualization of the vascular network is often limited by the spatial
resolution of the imaging tools (Wenner, 2009). The noninvasive
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for example, can image deep into
the tissue and provide 3-dimensional (3D) information; however, the
resolution is too low to observe the vascular and capillary structure at
the cellular level. With respect to the routine histochemical staining
and microscopy, the microtome-based 2-dimensional (2D) tissue
analysis allows micrometer-level resolution but conﬁnes the view at a
speciﬁc cut plane (Wu et al., 2005). In addition, the distortions and
artifacts caused by microtome slicing as well as the disconnection
between sectioned tissues prevent a global view of the vascular
network. To date, detailed morphologic analysis of the intestinal
microcirculation depends on vascular corrosion casts (Lametsch-
chwandtner et al., 1990; Djonov and Burri, 2004; Ravnic et al., 2007;
Filipovic et al., 2009; Folarin et al., 2010). However, this method is
destructive to the tissue, thus rendering it incapable of providing an
integrated visualization of the gut vasculature with its surrounding
mucosal architecture.
New advances in 3D optical methods, on the other hand, provide
the tools to build the vascular diagram with the associated mucosal
structure. First, the process of optical clearing (Tuchin et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2003; Xu andWang, 2004; Genina et al., 2008; Zimmerley
et al., 2009; Tseng et al., 2009; Hirshburg et al., 2007; Dickie et al.,
2006)–application of immersion solution to reduce random scattering
as light travels across media–generates transparent intestine by
minimizing refractive mismatch between the tissue constitutes
(refractive index at ∼1.46) and ﬂuids (water has a refractive index
at 1.33) (Fu et al., 2009). This allows a direct visualization of the
interior domain of the mucosa and submucosa via optical microscopy.
Second, in this research, we discover that the optical-clearing
immersion is compatible with blood vessel labeling with lipophilic
dyes (vessel painting) (Ravnic et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008) when the
intestine is immersed in the aqueous optical-clearing solution
FocusClear (US Patent 6472216) (Liu and Chiang, 2003). Our work
shows that the combination of vessel painting, optical clearing, and
confocal microscopy allows 3D presentation and analysis of the
intestinal vasculature in an integrated fashion. Panoramas of the
mouse intestinal vasculature and our approach of using optical

At the Movies: 3-Dimensional Technology and Gastrointestinal Histology

Gastrointestinal (GI) tissues consist of 3-dimensional(3D) microstructure, vasculature, and innervation
to coordinate physiologic activities. To examine these
cellular architectures, investigators often use microtome-
based 2-dimensional (2D) analysis, such as hematoxylin
and eosin or antibody staining and subsequent optical
or electron microscopy, to visualize the molecule/
structure of interest at a specific or a series of cut
planes. Because microtome slicing creates disconnections
between tissue sections as well as distortions and artifacts,
a microtome free, nondestructive imaging approach is pref-
erable to provide an integral visualization of the tissue
structure in situ.
Recently, significant progress has been made in optical
clearing of tissues and cells to generate transparent spec-
imens for microtome-free 3D microscopy.1–4 Visualiza-
tion of the image data over a region of tissue, such as a
suspicious area of the patient’s biopsy, provides a global
view of the tissue organization. This feature is particu-
larly valuable when intricate vascular and neuronal net-
works are the prime targets for inspection.
This article introduces the process of optical clearing
and its integration with deep-tissue microscopy for 3D
imaging of GI specimens with high definition. The goal is
to change our conventional planar view of the tissue
structure into a 3D panorama for better characterization
of the microstructure, vasculature, and innervation of the
GI tissues.
Optical Clearing Promotes Photon
Penetration in the Tissue
Light carries information about the tissue struc-
ture to detectors in optical imaging. For transparent
tissues such as the retina and the zebrafish embryo, light
can pass through with minimal scattering for visualiza-
tion of the molecules of interest. However, light is
strongly scattered by the GI tissues (particularly at the
visible spectrum), thereby limiting their optical accessi-
bility for deep-tissue imaging.
Optical clearing is the method of applying an immer-
sion solution to reduce random scattering as light travels
across media. The opaque tissue becomes transparent by
minimizing the refractive mismatch between the tissue
constitutes (refractive index at 1.46) and fluids (water
has a refractive index at 1.33; Figure 1A, B). Commonly
used optical-clearing solutions such as glycerol, dimethyl
sulfoxide, and polymer mixtures of polypropylene glycol
and polyethylene glycol have been applied in conjunction
with laser treatments of the skin to increase photon
penetration to reach the target for diagnostic as well as
therapeutic purposes.5,6 One specific feature of the opti-
cal-clearing effect is its reversibility. For instance, the skin
begins to increase its light transmittance in minutes
when immersed in glycerol. This increase can be reversed
by replacing glycerol with saline to restore the tissue
opacity and functions.
With regard to optical microscopy, optical clearing
increases the imaging depth and sensitivity by facilitating
laser penetration and fluorescence detection in confocal
laser-scanning microscopy. A number of approaches in-
volving treatment of agents such as xylene, mineral oil,
and methyl salicylate have been used to achieve refractive
uniformity in the fixed biological specimens, such as the
paraformaldehyde cross-linked GI tissues. These reagents
all have a refractive index higher than water and similar
to that of the glass coverslip and are used with oil-
immersion lenses.
Integration of Optical Clearing With
Deep-Tissue Microscopy
Confocal and 2- (or multi-) photon microscopy—2
forms of optical sectioning microscopy—are powerful
tools for investigation of the GI tissues. Whereas the
conventional wide-field fluorescent microscopy requires
microtome sectioning of the tissue to increase the light
transmittance and reduce the background, optical sec-
tioning imaging uses the pinhole and/or illumination
techniques to acquire optical slices from a thick specimen
by excluding the out-of-focus signals from the focal
plane. Recently, significant progress in confocal imaging
has led to the development of confocal laser endoscopy
for the in vivo diagnosis of GI disorders. This important

Abstract. Microscopic visualization of islets of Langerhans under nor-
mal and diabetic conditions is essential for understanding the patho-
physiology of the disease. The intrinsic opacity of pancreata, however,
limits optical accessibility for high-resolution light microscopy of islets
in situ. Because the standard microtome-based, 2-D tissue analysis
confines visualization of the islet architecture at a specific cut plane,
3-D representation of image data is preferable for islet assessment. We
applied optical clearing to minimize the random light scattering in the
mouse pancreatic tissue. The optical-cleared pancreas allowed pen-
etrative, 3-D microscopic imaging of the islet microstructure and vas-
culature. Specifically, the islet vasculature was revealed by vessel
painting—lipophilic dye labeling of blood vessels—for confocal mi-
croscopy. The voxel-based confocal micrographs were digitally pro-
cessed with projection algorithms for 3-D visualization. Unlike the
microtome-based tissue imaging, this optical method for penetrative
imaging of mouse islets yielded clear, continuous optical sections for
an integrated visualization of the islet microstructure and vasculature
with subcellular-level resolution. We thus provide a useful imaging
approach to change our conventional planar view of the islet structure
into a 3-D panorama for better understanding of the islet
physiology. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

1 Introduction
The islets of Langerhans are small endocrine organs scattered
in the pancreas that are crucial for maintaining the glucose
homeostasis. The spherical- or ovoid-shaped islet consists of
four major secretory cells of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin,
and pancreatic polypeptide, i.e., , , , and F cells, respec-
tively. The balance of the four cell types and the release of the
metabolic peptides are tightly regulated by a committee of
paracrine, endocrine, and neuronal cues, which poses a chal-
lenging task of analyzing the islet physiology as well as its
critical disorder—diabetes mellitus.1,2
Anatomically, the endocrine islets are surrounded by the
exocrine acini and constantly receive paracrine signals from
the neighboring acinar cells. In addition, islets are densely
vascularized, receiving 5 to 15% of the pancreatic blood sup-
ply, despite contributing only approximately 1% to the pan-
creatic volume.3,4 The structural and functional connections
between the islet endocrine cells and vascular endothelial
cells are important to provide oxygen and nutrients to the
endocrine cells and allow rapid transport of endocrine hor-
