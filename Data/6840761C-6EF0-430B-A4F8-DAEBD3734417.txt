L9-glioma bearing rat, and exhibited enhanced fluorescent contrast from tumor 
xenograft than normal tissue (150% maximal increase in the F9-teratocarcinoma cases 
and 75% maximal increase in the L9-glioma study) (14,15). The prolonged contrast 
lasted up to 48 hours, and was hypothesized to be in the tissue level correlating with 
the renal dominant dye metabolism and the tubular re-absorption for re-entering the 
circulation (15). In this study, we synthesized 
1,1’-bis-(4-sulfobutyl)indotricarbocyanine-5,5’-dicarboxylic acid diglucosamide 
monosodium salt (diglucosamid-SIDAG, the chemical structures of the two SIDAGs 
and ICG are shown in figure 1) to substitute diglucamid-SIDAG as contrast agent. 
The replacement of function groups on the two ends of the indocyanine from linear 
glucamine to cyclic glucosamine improves the molar absorption coefficient by 10% 
and quantum yield by 100% in the hydrophilic environment, and it can theoretically 
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical detection for more than two folds from 
the glucamid-SIDAG (15).

product was described in supplementary material 1.  
 
Sonogram 
High resolution sonograms of the xenografts were acquired by GE Logiq 700 Expert 
(GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) with a 9-12 MHz linear transducer. Before the 
examination, the mice received anesthetic agent, Zoletil (zolazepam hypochloride : 
tiletamine hypochloride = 1 : 1, Virbac Ltd., Milperra, New South Wales, Australia) 
by intramuscular injection at the dosage of 20-30 mg/kg. The localization and 
anatomical boundary of xenografts were firstly investigated by the 2-dimension gray 
scale mode detection; the color Doppler measurements were followed to monitor the 
blood flow on the xenografts region.   
 
In Vivo Fluorescence Imaging 
The in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice was acquired by Xenogen IVIS® Imaging 
System 200 Series (Caliper Life Science / Xenogen, Alameda, California, USA) 
within 24 hours after sonogram. Before and during the examination periods, the 
anesthesia of mice were initiated and maintained with inhalation of isoflurane 
(Halocarbon, River Edge, USA) in oxygen (1% to 2.5% isoflurane) within isolated 
chamber of the system. The contrast agent, diglucosamine-SIDAG in phosphate 
buffer saline, was administrated intravenously as a bolus through the tail vein at the 
dosage of 5mg/kg. Generally, a volume of 100μL solution in the concentration of 
4mM SIDAG was injected for a 30g subject. The mice were brought to the imaging 
chamber at indicated time frame, and placed in the center of field of view (FOV, 
deliberately chosen as 13cm × 13cm) with the aid of the green laser alignment 
projector grid. The in vivo fluorescence imaging processing procedure is illustrated in 
supplementary material 2. 
 
Anatomic Inspection and Histology of Xenografts 
The xenografts were harvested within 24 hours after in vivo fluorescence imaging, 
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The physical dimensions of those specimens 
were measured by electronic digital caliper (Long Jer Precision Industry Co. Ltd., 
Taiwan), and was applied in calculating the xenograft volume by using the formula V 
= 4π/3 × (product of the three diameters) (29). The specimens were subsequently 
paraffin-embedded, sectioned and processed with conventional hemotoxylin & eosin 
staining for visualization of general tissue morphology and mitotic figures under 
microscopic observation.

Anatomical Findings of Xenografts 
The anatomical information of all xenografts is listed in table 1. Generally, the 
appearance of the formalin-fixed malignant xenografts was in the oval to ellipsoidal 
shape with yellowish opaque appearance and relatively rough surface (Fig 2A), 
field microscopic images of the paraffin-embedded, sectioned tissue slice with 
hemotoxylin & eosin staining showed that the tumor masses were grown as enlarged 
cysts (Fig 2B). The more tumor cells, the more condensed fibrotic tissues around the 
tumor masses (compared to Fig 3C of benign xenograft), indicated the relative higher 
malignancy of the xenograft (Fig 2C). The tumor cells were round to oval in shape with 
mitotic features in the xenograft (Fig 2D). 
 The benign masses were composed of Matrigel substance and infiltrated by the 
fibrotic tissue inside, and encapsulated with relatively looser fibrotic tissue (compared 
to the encapsulation of the malignant xenografts, Fig 3C) attached to the boundary of 
the xenografts (Fig 2D).

mouse. A, the appearance of the xenograft is shown as formalin fixed tissue block for 
comparison. The mass appeared flat, and glossy-grey in color. B, 20X magnification, C, 100X 
magnification, D, 400X magnification, are bright field microscopic images of the 
paraffin-embedded, sectioned tissue slice with hemotoxylin & eosin staining for visualization of 
morphology. B, C & D, the mass was composed of Matrigel substance and infiltrated with 
fibrotic tissue inside, and encapsulated with relatively looser (compared to the encapsulation of 
malignant xenograft) fibrotic tissue attached to the boundary of the xenograft. 
 
Sonogram of Xenografts 
All of the 21 developed (malignant or benign) lesions could be positioned and 
measured under the sonogram. The benign masses appeared as flat disk in shape 
average longitudinal length of the malignant xenografts under sonogram was 0.87cm 
(ranged from 0.49cm to 1.08cm).  
 
In Vivo Fluorescent Imaging of Xenografts 
The epi-fluorescent (excited on the coronal plane above the back) of the control group 
mice reached peak value about 60-90 minutes after administration of 
diglucosamid-SIDAG, and faded gradually in the following hours as showed in Fig 5. 
The strongest signal was observed along the middle line of chest-back region, 
followed by the major muscle group such as thigh, then the edge of body trunk, which 
is hypothetically due to the accumulation of the hydrophilic dye in the circulation 
initially, and then perfusion effect in tissue reflecting the length of light path from the 
regional body thickness. The cross-section radiance profiles of control mice showed 
chiral symmetry about the axis of body middle lines, with the adjacent points on the 
mirror side had similar normalized radiance with bias less than 3% (Fig 6). The 
characteristic of the symmetrical profile was applied in the study as the criteria for 
evaluating the specificity in lesion depiction and radiance contribution of xenografts 
(Fig 8C, 10C).

The Pseudo-color scale bar at right represents the epi-fluorescence radiance 
(photons/sec/cm2/sr). The acquisitions at time post SIDAG injection are indicated below each 
image. D, the transverse cross-section radiance profile indicated by the double head arrow is 
plotted in Fig 6.

MCF-7 cell / Matrigel; right: PBS / Matrigel). B, C, D, the acquisitions at time post SIDAG 
injection are indicated below each image. 
 
The regional signal around 87.5% (7/8) of the developed benign xenografts can 
be located and depicted visually between the 6th and 9th hours as shown in Fig 6. The 
transverse cross-section radiance profile passing the pixel with the strongest signal in 
the region of benign xenograft also showed asymmetric distribution with the body 
trunk middle line as axis (Fig 10C). However, the pixels with the strongest radiance 
within the benign xenograft region were about +2% to -14% of the strongest signal 
outside the xenograft from the middle line on the same transverse cross-section. The 
only developed benign xenograft, which cannot be depicted visually on the in vivo 
fluorescence imaging, was also migrated from the implanted site to the ventral region. 
  
Delineation of Lesions from Optical Imaging with Sonogram as Reference 
In order to delineating the margin of the tumor xenografts, the signal of xenografts 
should be extracted from the gross signal in each pixel combining contributions from 
both xenograft and body trunk. The No. 7 mouse had the strongest center pixel 
epi-fluorescence value around the region of malignant xenograft, showed highest 
contrast compared to the value of body middle line pixel at the 7th hour post dye 
administration, and was selected as standard to be calibrated with the grey-scale 
 Figure 8: Radiance profiles of malignant xenograft from in vivo fluorescence imaging. The 
results demonstrated were detected from No. 7 mouse with strongest average and single pixel 
epi-fluorescence value around the region of malignant xenograft. A, the radiance map was 
processed by MATLAB from the epi-fluorescence (Fig. 8C) with the Pseudo-color scale bar at 
right representing the normalized radiance calculated by dividing its epi-fluorescence value to 
the value of the pixel with maximal epi-fluorescence around the center of the malignant 
xenograft in the figure. B, the contour traces of corresponding threshold values marked by the 
normalized radiance processed by MATLAB. C & D, The normalized value of each pixel was 
calculated by dividing its epi-fluorescence value to the maximal epi-fluorescence pixel value 
around the center of the malignant xenograft and applied in defining the threshold value. 
 
The acquisitions of fluorescence imaging and sonogram were from different 
angles as shown in supplementary material 6. It results in different detected xenograft 
transverse axis lengths in the two modalities. However, the detected xenograft 
longitudinal axis lengths from the two imaging system are theoretically in the same 
length. The longitudinal axis length of No. 7 mouse was 1.07cm under sonogram 
detection (Fig 4A).  
From Fig 8C, the signal from malignant xenograft (causing an extruding spike on 
the left edge of the semisphere-like distribution) can be located from 0 to 1cm along 
the axis, with the pixel signal value above 0.5 of the strongest signal pixel. If the 
threshold value of xenograft pixel was set at 0.5, the longitudinal axis length of No. 7 
mouse tumor xenograft was 1.408cm (Fig 8D), 32% longer than the expected length 
as the sonogram detection result, 1.07cm (Fig 4A). Although the tumor xenograft 
than the actual xenograft pixels. The threshold value is calibrated with the sonogram 
result and set to be 0.79 for resulting in the closest analytical dimension, 1.084cm, of 
the tumor xenograft longitudinal axis length from the fluorescence imaging as shown 
in Fig 8D. The comparison of the tumor xenogtafts longitudinal axes length detected 
by the sonogram and fluorescence imaging was listed in Table 2. With the calibrated 
threshold value, 0.79, the average error of the measured lengths between the two 
systems was 5.1%. The accuracy of agreement between fluorescence imaging 
measurements and sonogram reference for tumor xenograft longitudinal length was 
assessed by the method of linear correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis. A linear 
correlation (the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.8582 and the y-intercept is -0.0433 
cm) between the two methods is shown in Fig 9A. The average reading from 
fluorescence imaging is 0.05cm shorter than the average sonogram reading with the 
95% confidential interval ± 0.2274cm, which is acceptable bias for clinical medical 
imaging (Fig 9B).          
 
 
faded gradually in the following hours as showed in Fig 12A. The strongest signal 
was observed along the middle line of chest-back region, followed by thigh area, then 
flank area.

xenograft. A, the agreement was analyzed by Bland-Altman method. B, the linear correlation

average normalized contrasts (ratio of radiance) of the benign xenograft was about 
7-20% higher than the value from representative of normal tissue (thigh/flank), both 
values at same time-intervals usually cannot be differentiated with statistical 
significance. At the 7th hour, the average normalized contrasts of tumor xenograft 
increased by 74% (malignant implant/flank, 2.57 ± 0.14) comparing to normal 
tissues (thigh/flank, 1.48 ± 0.09); the benign xenografts (benign implant/flank, 1.76 
± 0.13) enhanced the contrast value by only 19% comparing to normal tissue.

The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and mouse microvascular endothelial cell 
line, SVEC 4-10, incubated with 600µM diglucosamid-SIDAG at indicated time intervals. The 
intracellular fluorophores were extracted and measured by fluorescence measurement for 
evaluating intracellular level at indicated time intervals. 
 
In Vitro Cell-line Study for Cellular Level Retention of Fluorophore 
In the cell line study, both cell lines were treated with 600μM diglucosamid-SIDAG, 
which is the similar concentration in the circulation of the in vivo study (30). After 
extracting the intracellular level of fluorophore for analysis, the tumor cell was found 
to have statistically significant increase in the uptake amount during the time-intervals 
of 1to 8 hours (Fig 12). Human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) showed enhanced 
intracellular uptake of diglucosamide-SIDAG during the “delayed wash-out period” 
than mouse endothelial cell line (SVEC 4-10) in the mean contrast value, 109%.    
 
Discussion 
The xenograft model established in this study had demonstrated several characteristics 
of malignant and benign lesions under both sonogram and histological analysis. 
Matrigel is composed of the basement membrane protein components extracted from 
acceptable error of longitudinal axis length of lesion assessment between sonogram 
and fluorescence imaging. The quantification of the “delayed wash-out phenomenon” 
contrast in fluorescence imaging highlighted during 6th to 9th hours post contrast agent 
injection, and the normalized contrast at 7th hour, exceeding 2.5, statistically 
indicating the malignancy of tissue, compared to that of benign xenograft and normal 
tissue with similar length of light path (body / tissue thickness) in the value below 2. 
The preliminary result suggested that the fluorescence Imaging contrasted by cellular 
preferential uptake of NIR fluorophore, diglucosamid-SIDAG, in malicious xenograft 
could be applied in malignancy screening and non-invasive delineation of breast 
lesions. However, two of the xenografts (one in control group and one in experimental 
group) cannot be efficiently specified in the study due to the translocation of implants 
to the hinder side away from the excitation / detection of the system, which might 
causing insufficient emission signal for reconstructing the xenograft imaging. The 
more advanced 3D tomography technology, such as fluorescence mediate tomography 
(28,32), can eliminate the limitation of excitation / detection angle of imaging 
reconstruction, could be a remedy of this fluorophore contrast imaging method for 
clinical applications.    
 Glucamid-SIDAG (with linear glucamine side groups) is generally considered to 
be a non-targeting perfusion type contrast agent, demonstrating the discrepancies 
between lesions based on tissue level physiological differences (15-20,28,31). The 
preliminary result of in vitro cell line study under diglucosamide-SIDAG (with cyclic 
glucosamine side groups) treatment showed preferential intracellular uptake in 
MCF-7 cells. The abnormal intracellular preferential uptake of similar indole 
fluorophore, ICG, through the existence of glutathione S-transferase subunit have 
been imply for the indication of human hepatocarcinoma (35). The cell line study 
indicated that the internalization of fluorophore reached saturation in one hour; 
however the in vivo study with similar regional dye concentration showed “delayed 
wash-out phenomenon” after 6th hour of dye administration. We hypothesized that the 
fluorescence signals were dominantly from the perfusion effect (accumulation of 
fluorophore in the tissue level interstitial fluids) in the early phase, and the effect of 
the weaker intracellular fluorophore level surfaced after partial clearance of 
extracellular accumulation of fluorophore from perfusion after hours of dye 
administration. The exact transportation mechanism of cellular uptake and its 
correlation with in vivo “delayed wash-out phenomenon” needs further in vitro and in 
vivo investigations.

with the mouse laid on the side and excitation propagated vertically above the surface 
of the lesion.

Effect of Epi-fluorescence Scattering in Turbid Bio-medium on Visual Discrimination 
of Xenograft Anatomical Dimension 
 
The emitted fluorescence is propagate in all directions, and highly scattered in 
biological medium between source and detector. The projected dimension of xenograft 
is supposed to larger than the actual size, because some pixels outside the xenografts 
region but near the edge of the xenograft were contaminated with the fluorescence 
signal from the xenograft. The normalized radiance (ratio of radiance) plot on top 
explains that although the pixel threshold level was observed to be 0.5 visually, the 
margin / pixels of the actual xenograft should be defined by higher threshold value, 
0.79.

xenograft margin had lower optical threshold value (0.5) than the actual xenograft 
margin with the threshold value, 0.79.

摘要 
 
Key word: NIR fluorophore, Optical imaging, Sonogram, Breast cancer diagnosis, 
 
The key of efficient breast cancer management is based on the early screening of 
lesion malignancy and efficient evaluation of lesion size/boundary. Presently, 
mammogram from 2-dimension tissue x-ray absorption is the gold standard of clinical 
screening, which is with limited contrast and inconclusive in the malignancy of 
suspicious lesions. More invasive needle biopsy procedure can provide the efficient 
evidence of malignancy, but it has the risk of metastasis from tumor cell detachment 
and release in the circulation.  
The project will evaluate the potential of the combination imaging tools (optical 
imaging with near infrared fluorophore, SIDAG, and sonogram) for non-invasive, low 
facility requirement and low cost breast cancer diagnosis. The average value of optical 
and echo signals from normal tissue, benign lesion xenografts (extracellular 
membrane extract from the EHS mouse sarcoma) and malignant tumor xenografts 
(MCF-7 cell) developed in nude mice will be recorded and mapped for the following 
procedures:   
1. Average threshold value of contrasts among the normal tissue, benign lesion 
xenograft and malignant tumor xenograft (screening). 
2. Size and boundary of tumor tissue (staging of cancer). 
3. Size and boundary of tumor tissue before and after chemotherapy 
(evaluation of treatment).   
The sonogram will be applied to estimate the boundary of both benign lesion and 
malignant tumors from the echo contrast with the background (normal tissue); and the 
Doppler imaging of sonogram will be detected to monitor the average threshold level 
of blood flow from angiogenesis in the malignant tissue and compared to the 
corresponding level in benign lesion xenograft. SIDAG is found to have superior 
optical properties, and biocompatibility than ICG, the only FDA-approved NIR
