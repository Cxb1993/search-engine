with the optimal real-time system management, 
are being promoted to reduce the use of central 
fossil fired power plant, increase the reliability 
and efficiency in delivery of energy and reduce 
emissions.  It is envisaged that flexible ac 
transmission systems (FACTS) devices or controllers 
are going to play a critical role in operating the new 
type of power systems under such a complex 
operating environment [1]-[5]. The basic concept 
drawn from the flexible ac transmission systems 
(FACTS) terminology emerges as a remedy to 
release the extremely transmission system tension. 
However, it needs the aid of modern power 
electronics and advanced control techniques to 
successfully replace the conventional mechanical 
controlled apparatuses in systems. By doing so, 
FACTS technology has been expected to offer a 
number of advantages, i.e. to bring the transfer 
capability of transmission line approaching its 
thermal limit without violating the stability 
criteria, to re-assign power flows at will and on a 
real-time basis so as to facilitate an ideal 
electricity market and to increase the riding 
through capability when critical faults are 
encountered. Besides, FACTS devices can also 
enhance the operating flexibility of the power 
system with their fast control characteristics and 
continuous compensating capabilities.  Of the known 
FACTS devices, the STATCOM being a new 
generation of reactive power compensating devices 
has been widely used in various power system control 
[5]-[17]. From the hardware point of view, a 
STATCOM is similar to the shunt branch of the 
unified power flow controller (UPFC) and can be 
controlled to provide concurrent real and reactive 
compensations with an external electric energy 
source adding to its internal dc bus. In the literature, a 
number of feasible hardware configurations have 
been proposed for the STATCOM to perform 
various reactive power and voltage control functions 
in power systems embedded with distributed 
generators; however, most of them are designed on a 
3-leg 6-switch (3L-6S) structure operated either 
by SPWM or multi-module and multi-level 
techniques [18]-[22]. To achieve a cost-effective 
design without sacrificing the control performances 
some possible topologies with advanced controllers 
and fast-response features are still call for 
investigations.   
 
(二) 研究目的 
 
The main objective of this research project is to 
design a low-cost and high-performance reactive 
power compensating device, i.e., a two-leg 
four-switch (2L-4S) STATCOM. The proposed 
hardware simplified STATCOM is designed to 
provide satisfactory performances in performing 
various dynamic reactive power flow control 
functions during steady-state and transient 
operations of power systems. To verify the overall 
performance of the hardware simplified 
STATCOM, two topologies (2L-4S and 3L-6S) 
with three switching techniques, i.e. sinusoidal 
pulse width modulation (SPWM), voltage 
hysteresis (VH) and space vector pulse width 
modulation (SVPWM), have been investigated in 
this project.  Comprehensive simulation studies 
are firstly carried out in the Matlab/Simulink 
environment and results of various power flow 
control examples are then evaluated to check the 
feasibility of the 2L-4S STATCOM hardware 
configuration and verify the effectiveness of the 
proposed control strategy. Finally, a DSP based 
STATCOM experimental system is constructed 
to practically test the overall performance of the 
proposed STATCOM. 
 
 (三) 研究方法 
 
z STATCOM hardware and its principles 
 
In a conventional STATCOM system, the 
internal 3 phase inverter normally constructed by 
a 3-leg and 6-switch (3L-6S, Fig. 1) configuration 
provides the main control functions via 
connecting its output voltage with a controllable 
magnitude and phase angle in shunt with the 
compensated power system through a transformer. 
In this project, a simple three-phase converter 
constituted by 2-leg and 4-switch (2L-4S, Fig. 2) 
is used to work with the designed power flow 
 4
the dc bus voltage of the STATCOM inverter. 
Since the dynamic model of an electrical power 
system is conventionally developed in a d-q frame, 
it is also desirable to obtain the model of 
STATCOM in the utility d-q frame. To transfer the 
abc variables to a d-q frame, a transformation 
matrix is selected such that the voltage and current 
components of STATCOM are proportional to its 
real and reactive power components respectively. 
Thus, the control of each current component 
regulating the corresponding power components 
can be achieved. The STATCOM variables in the 
abc frame can be transferred to the d-q frame by 
the following Clark transformation.  
 
 qdos abcsf Kf=                            (6)

The modeling steps of a space vector pulse 
width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm are 
adopted from the author’s previous work [21] and 
described again in this subsection. One feasible 
configuration is depicted in Fig. 4. The 
corresponding current paths are shown in Fig. 5 (a) 
to Fig. 5 (d).

derived as follows:

Fig. 9 . The control system block diagram of the proposed 
P-Q controllers. 
 
For identifying and controlling the dynamics 
of the power system and the 2-leg 4-switch 
STATCOM, the single-machine infinite-bus 
(SMIB) power system shown in Fig. 10 is simulated 
in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulink model 
tool is a commercial grade transient simulator of 
electric networks with the capability of modeling 
complex power electronics, controls and the 
nonlinear power network.  The power system 
shown in Fig. 10 comprises a voltage source 
(normally a synchronous generator with an 
automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is used), 
which is connected to a load bus through a 
transmission lines. The STATCOM is placed at the 
load bus to support the voltage. This simple 
system is chosen in order to evaluate the power 
flow control performances of the proposed new 
STATCOM configurations with two basic control 
strategies, i.e. reactive power and voltage 
regulations. The detailed control structure for the 
proposed STATCOM and the related system 
parameters can be found in Fig. 10.  In Fig. 10, the 
control scheme shown in Fig. 9 (PI and decoupled 
controllers) is used to perform the P (Vdc) and Q 
power flow control functions. Fig. 11 to 12 show a 
set of typical simulation results obtained in this 
study.  In Fig. 11 to 12, the control results 
concerning the real and reactive power regulations 
of a STATCOM are presented.  
To demonstrate the performance of the 
proposed hardware simplified STATCOM in 
voltage regulation, Fig. 13 to Fig. 18 show a set of 
comparative simulation results concerning the 
PCC voltage regulations under load disturbances 
(two-steps in load changes) with the various 
switching methods working on both the 3L-6S 
and the 2L-4S inverter topologies.

In this project, the proposed control scheme is 
experimentally tested as configured in Fig. 19 (a). 
In the hardware setup, a DSP based 2L-4S three

聆聽。筆者之論文被安排於 3 月 18 日上午 ICEE IV [ Day 3 (10:45 - 13:00) at Seminar Room E ]中
發表。此次除了論文之發表外也把握機會收集若干電力相關廠商及其新研發之產品等資訊並與若
干業界專家及學者充份討論，雙方均獲得良好的知識交流。 
 
二、與會心得 
此次筆者於會議期間參加多場次(Sessions)論文發表、聆聽及向與會學者討教若干電力控制等相關
問題，主要是在電力品質控制、分散式發電及微電網的發展現況與限制及未來可能之控制需求方面。
其實國外在分散式發電及微電網方面的研究已進行相當長的時間，研究成果也相當多，大部份已發
表在重要的期刊上。由於我國目前亦致力於分散式電源系統及微電網的規劃與推廣，筆者希望能藉
由此次的與會及討論心得吸取他人長處，並訂定及修正個人未來研究方向。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
無 
 
四、建議 
從此次的會議論文討論的議題可以觀察出，爾後電力工程學門研究工作將會是更加熱絡，特
別是電力電子系統之應用控制將日趨重要。此次的與會，見到多位活躍於電力界著名學者，能與
其交換個人研究心得，深感難能可貴，希望下次有機會能夠再次參加。筆者也由衷感謝國科會在
經費上給予補助。 
 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
攜回會議論文集: IMECS International Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE 2011) 一冊，
光碟 2 片，試用版電力系統及電力電子模擬軟體二套，免費技術論文及大容量電力電子元件及控
制器廠商相關資料一批。 
 
六、其他 
筆者之論文 “New Control Strategies for a Two-Leg Four-Switch STATCOM” 被安排於 18 日上午
