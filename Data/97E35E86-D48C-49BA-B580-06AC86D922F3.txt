well at a pre-assumed noise density level 
but poorly at other noise density levels.  
In this project, to avoid the 
counter-intuition problem and to improve 
the quality of images corrupted by 
impulsive noise, both data fusion and 
fuzzy techniques are incorporated into the 
framework of our new decision-based 
filter. The new decision-based fuzzy 
averaging (DFA) filter consists of two 
phases: the detection phase and the 
filtering phase, which are based on D-S 
evidence theory and fuzzy noise 
cancellation, respectively. An impulse 
detection approach that uses the final 
belief values of the classification of 
hypotheses to build the decision rule that 
distinguishes noise-free pixels from 
noise-corrupted pixels is proposed. For 
noise cancellation, a fuzzy averaging 
mechanism, where the weights are 
constructed using a predefined fuzzy set, 
is adopted.  Experimental results 
demonstrate that the proposed DFA filter 
outperforms other decision-based filters in 
terms of both noise suppression and detail 
preservation. Moreover, the proposed 
filter provides satisfactory results in 
removing a mix of Gaussian and 
impulsive noise. 
 
二、證據合成規則：  
The theory provides a way of 
combining independent bodies of 
evidence to increase confidence in the 
overall hypothesis. The n  combined 
bodies of evidence can be calculated by 
orthogonal sum nmmmm ⊕⊕⊕= L21  
for fusing independent information 
sources .im The orthogonal sum is 
associative and commutative; it is defined 
in Dempster’s rule of combination:

and 
.Ω⊆A  Note that 11 −− K  can be 
interpreted as a measure of conflict among 
the bodies of evidence to be combined. 
After the combination, a decision can be 
made among the hypotheses according to 
the decision rule chosen. There are three 
widely used decision rules: (a) maximum 
belief, (b) maximum plausibility, and (c) 
maximum belief without overlapping of 
belief interval (Hégarat-Mascle, Richard 
& Ottlé, 2003). The decision rules tend to 
be developed to fit the needs of specific 
applications. 
It is worth mentioning that 
combining conflicting evidence using 
Dempster’s combination rule may produce 
counter-intuitive results. To avoid some 
counter-intuitive effects that may be 
encountered when combining 
contradictory bodies of evidence, several 
authors have proposed other solutions. 
The K  in (2.1) is a normalizing factor 
which intuitively measures how much the 
mass functions are conflicting. Under an 
open-world assumption, Smets proposed 
his unnormalized combination rule: 
∑ ∏
=∩∩ =

L1 1
)()( ,  .Ω⊆∀A  
This rule implies that the mass of the null 
set may be nonzero, which violates the 
condition expressed by (2.1); such cases 
reflect contradiction in the state of belief. 
However, this cannot occur under a 
close-world assumption. The high conflict 
level is the effect of the fact that one of 
the sources is erroneous. In this project, 
we consider 0)( =φm  and use the 
normalized combination rule. There is a 
special case of the belief function, namely 
the simple support function, that is very 
good at representing evidence. The simple 
support function dedicated to a specific 
non-empty subset A  of ,Ω →Ω2:S  
]1,0[ , is defined on Ω2  such that: 
                    
 4
are the set of rank-ordered pixels. Thus, 
the difference )(kd  between the value 
)(kx  of the input pixel and the 
rank-ordered mean gray level in the filter 
window }{kw  provides efficient 
evidence about the likelihood of 
corruption for the current pixel. This way, 
)(kd  can be a body of evidence for 
detecting the probability of a 
contaminated input ).(kx  Therefore, the 
variable )(kd  can be represented as the 
mass function ).()( Nm kd  A large 
)()( Nm kd  value indicates that the input 
)(kx  is dissimilar to the rank-ordered 
mean value of the filter window },{kw  
suggesting that the central pixel )(kx  is 
likely corrupted by impulsive noise.  
To avoid the counter-intuition 
problem and the high computation 
complexity for Dempster’s combination 
rule, we follow the definition of the 
simple support function to make choices 
for the mass functions ,,, NFφ  and 
FN ∪  as follows:

where )(kx  is the mean gray level in the

Once the probability of the local contrast

impulsive noise since the associated local 
contrast is very different from those of its 
neighbors. Now, )(kp  can be 
represented as the mass function

Since impulsive noise pixels 
normally occur as outliners in a small 
neighborhood around the pixel, they 
generally cause large )(kd  and 
)(kp values. However, when a noise-free 
input pixel is located on an edge, )(kd  
and )(kp  values can also be relatively 
large. Therefore, we consider evidence

was used as the training image for the FM 
filter and PFM filter. Notably, no training 
process is needed for the DFA filter. Table 
1 shows the PSNR comparison results of 
noise removal for images corrupted by 
20% impulsive noise. It can be seen that 
the proposed DFA filter outperforms the 
other decision-based filters, providing 
higher PSNR values. Fig. 3 shows the 
results of filtering the ‘Lena’ image 
corrupted by 20% impulse and the MAE 
value. The DFA filter offers better visual 
quality in the restored image with more 
noise attenuation and detail preservation, 
giving the smallest MAE value. To 
demonstrate the robustness of the DFA 
filter, Figs. 4 and 5 show the PSNR and 
MAE comparisons, respectively, for the 
‘Lena’ image restored from corruption of 
2%-50% impulsive noise. Notably, 
although the SD-ROM filter has better 
restoration results at lower noise ratios, it 
performed poorly at higher noise ratios 
(Abreu & Mitra, 1995). Figs. 4 and 5 
clearly show that the proposed DFA filter 
outperforms the other filters. 
Although the DFA filter was 
originally designed for the removal of 
impulsive noise, it works well in reducing 
a mix Gaussian and impulsive noise. 
Performance comparisons were also made 
between the proposed filter and other 
decision-based filters. Table 2 shows that 
the proposed filter performed well, 
providing considerable improvement in 
PSNR over the other methods. Figure 4 
shows a comparison of image restoration 
results and MAE values for the ‘Bridge’ 
image corrupted by a mix of Gaussian 
)20( =σ  and impulsive noise (20%). As 
Fig. 6 shows, the DFA filter gives the best 
visual quality with fewer spots and other 
artifacts with the smallest MAE values. 
 
五、討論與結論： 
In this project, A decision-based 
fuzzy averaging (DFA) filter consisting of 
a D-S noise detector and a two-pass noise 
filter was presented. For DFA, bodies of 
evidence are extracted, and the basic 
belief assignment is defined using the 
simple support function, which avoids the 
counter-intuition problem of Dempster’s 
combination rule. The combination of 
noise-corruption belief values is used as 
the decision rule of the D-S noise detector. 
A fuzzy averaging method, where the 
weight is constructed using a predefined 
fuzzy set, was developed for noise 
cancellation. In addition, a simple 
second-pass filtering mechanism is added 
to the system to improve the final filtering 
performance. Experimental results show 
that the DFA filter suppresses impulsive 
noise and a mix of Gaussian and 
impulsive noise and enhances the image 
quality.

that 11 −− K  can be interpreted as a measure of conflict 
among the bodies of evidence to be combined. After the 
combination, a decision can be made among the different 
hypotheses according to the decision rule chosen. The 
decision rules tend to be developed to fit the needs of specific 
applications. 
It is worth mentioning that combining conflicting evidence 
in Dempster’s combination rule may produce 
counter-intuitive results [13]. To avoid counter-intuitive 
effects, several authors have proposed other solutions [16]. 
The K  in (5) is a normalizing factor which intuitively 
measures how much the mass functions are conflicting.

This rule implies that the mass of the null set may be nonzero, 
which violates the condition expressed by (1), and such cases 
reflect contradiction in the state of belief. However, this 
cannot occur under a close-world assumption, and the high 
conflict level is the effect of the fact that one of the sources is 
erroneous [18]. In this work, we will consider 0)( =φm  and 
use the normalized combination rule. There is a special case 
of belief function, namely the simple support function, that is 
very good at representing evidence. The simple support 
function dedicated to a specific non-empty subset A  of ,Ω  
]1,0[2: →ΩS , is defined on Ω2  such that

III. DESIGN OF  DFA FILTER 
Let )(kx  represent the input gray level of the image at the 
pixel .k  The filter window }{kw  is defined in terms of the 
image coordinates symmetrically surrounding the current 
pixel ).(kx The window size 12 += nS ( n  is a non-negative 
integer) can be given by 
},,,1,,,2,1:)({}{ Snnfkxkw f LL +==              (8) 
where the input pixel )()( 1 kxkx n+=  is the central pixel.  
A. The Structure of the DFA filter 
As a decision-based filter, the proposed DFA filter consists 
of a D-S noise detector and a two-pass filtering mechanism to 
remove impulsive noise as shown in Figs.1 and 2, 
respectively. The input pixels are first identified by the 
proposed D-S noise detector to be either noise-free or 
noise-corrupted. The output flag )(kα  indicates whether the 
pixel has been detected as impulse. The following subsection 
will discuss evidence extraction, basic belief assignment, 
evidence fusion and the belief decision rule. Then, in the 
noise-filtering process, the DFA filter operates mainly by a 
two-pass filtering procedure, as shown in Fig. 2. If the input 
pixel )(kx  is identified as a corrupted pixel, then a fuzzy 
filter will have it replaced. Otherwise, the pixel is kept 
unchanged. Second-pass filtering is performed by the simple 
decision filter to remove noisy pixels that may have been 
mistakenly left undetected by the D-S noise detector and to 
restore the mis-detected of good pixels. 
B. D-S noise detector  
The decision-making process is the key to a successful 
decision-based filter. In general, the decision measure is 
defined as a statistical parameter to capture and represent the 
local property of the region. However, the performance of a 
decision-based filter depends on the mechanism it uses to 
compute the threshold value. That is, there is a trade-off 
between noise detection and image restoration. The D-S noise 
detector of the proposed DFA filter takes bodies of evidence 
into consideration so that the smartest decision can be made. 
With the D-S evidence theory applied to the noise detector, 
the frame of discernment includes two elements: noise-free 
)(F and noise-corrupted ).(N  The hypotheses (power set) 
 
 
 
where ici = th smallest }.{ ia Excluding ),(kx for each pixel 
},{)( kwkxi ∈ ia  is defined as the absolute difference in 
intensity between )(kx and );(kxi  i.e., .)()( kxkxa ii −=  
Then, ia  values are sorted in increasing order into the 
sequence }.{ ia  The noisy pixels have higher mean ROAD 
values than the noise-free pixels. Therefore, the mean ROAD 
value )(ko can be regarded as a body of evidence providing a 
measure of how close a pixel value is to its three most similar 
neighbors. Now, )(ko  can be represented as the mass 
function ).()( Nm ko  A large )()( Nm ko  value indicates that 
the central pixel )(kx is probably corrupted by impulsive 
noise. Just as with evidence ),(kd the strategy for 
determining the corresponding mass function values can be 
also derived by using Eq.10. 
Similarly, line components are usually present in images; 
therefore, if )(kx  is located on the line, the above bodies of 
evidence )(kd and )(kp  may be mistakenly interpreted as 
impulsive noise. To avoid wrong judgments, it is necessary to 
add other observations to improve the correctness. Thus, 
another piece of evidence )(kq  is provided. It is defined as 
follows [11].

Note that )(1 kpc  and )(2 kpc  are selected to be the values 
closest to that of )(kp  among its adjacent pixels in the filter 
window }{kw [11]. If the evidence )(kq  is applied, then the 
line component in the filter window }{kw will not be detected 
as noise because of the small )(kq  value. Now, )(kq  can be 
represented as the mass function ).()( Nm kq  A small 
)()( Nm kq  value indicates that the central pixel )(kx  is 
noise-free. Just as with evidence ),(kd the strategy for 
determining the corresponding mass function values can be 
also derived by using Eq.10. 
B.2. Evidence combination   
The degrees of belief based on distinct bodies of evidence 
can be combined to form a new degree of belief. The different 
bodies of evidence may either strengthen or weaken the same 
hypotheses; in other words, these bodies of evidence may 
support the same conclusion or may conflict with each other. 
In our design, the four mass functions )()(),( , kokpkd mmm  
and )(kqm  can be combined to obtain the final mass function 
m  according to the orthogonal sum defined by Dempster’s 
combination rule. Notably, since the simple support function 
is applied, the conflict effect is not taken into account. Thus, 
the orthogonal sum is written for all non-empty subsets A  of 
the frame of discernment },{ FN as follows.

The belief and plausibility functions can be computed by 
applying (3) and (4), respectively, based on the final mass 
function .m  
B.3. Decision rule of the D-S noise detector 
In this work, the decision rule is determined by the final 
combined belief values. Then, the D-S noise detector of the 
DFA filter determines whether the input )(kx  is a 
noise-corrupted pixel )1)(( =kα or noise-free pixel 
)0)(( =kα according to the following belief decision rule.

That is, if the value of )(NBel  exceeds that of ),(NFBel  then 
the input  )(kx  is judged to be a noisy pixel.  
C. Two-pass noise filtering 
If the input pixel is classified as impulsive noise according 
to its )(kα  by the D-S noise detector, then the proposed 
fuzzy averaging (FA) filter is activated. Otherwise, the input 
pixel is not replaced. Since non-homogeneous neighborhoods 
may exist in the filter window, it is better to incorporate the 
knowledge of the other pixels to improve the filtering 
performance [19]. This is where the fuzzy approach comes 
into play. The output )(' ky of the first-pass DFA filter for the 
input )(kx  is given by

                                     V. CONCLUSION    
A new decision-based fuzzy averaging (DFA) filter 
consisting of a D-S noise detector and a two-pass noise 
filtering has been presented in this paper. Bodies of evidence 
are extracted, and the basic belief assignment is defined by 
using the simple support function which can avoid the 
counter-intuition problem of Dempster’s combination rule. 
The combination of noise-corruption belief values is used as 
the decision rule of the D-S noise detector. A fuzzy averaging 
method where the weight is constructed using a predefined 
fuzzy set is developed for noise cancellation. Experimental 
results have shown the success of the new DFA filter in 
suppressing impulsive noise and in enhancing the image 
quality.
