where |S| denotes the cardinality of set S, the summation is over all possible pairs of (Ai , Bj) 
such that α and β is an element of ps’(Ai) and ps’(Bj) respectively.  Then, the elements of 
the normalized DDI interaction matrix APαβ (so-called appearance probability matrix (Han 
et al. 2004) is defined by

The matrix element APαβ represents the DDI probability of domain combination α and β. 
If a DDI is found more frequently than expected by chance, it is likely that this DDI is a 
true interacting domain pair.   
The results of putative DDI are computed for seven species. For each species, a negative 
learning set is constructed in order to improve the accuracy of DDI prediction. That is, 
given N proteins having K protein-protein interactions among them, the size of the negative 
learning set is equal to CN2 + N – K. This number represents the total number of 
non-interacting protein pairs for a particular species. Then, we calculated the probability of 
the DDI for the negative set of domain combination pairs, but now in the non-interaction 
space. Introduction of the negative learning set generated three AP matrices, one for the 
DDI space, I, one for the domain-domain non-interaction space (derived from the negative 
learning set), R, and the matrix elements of these two matrices are denoted by APIαβ and 
APRαβ   respectively. The overlapping region of matrices API and APR   is denoted by APC, 
where C denotes the overlapping part.  In other words, the domain combination pairs of two 
proteins A and B could be classified into three categories, that is DCI(A,B), DCR(A,B) and 
DCC(A,B). 
After constructing the AP matrices, one can predict the interaction probability between 
the protein pair (A, B) based on the three AP matrices. Let X denotes the PPI and non-PPI 
events. A value of one and zero represent the PPI and non-PPI event respectively. Given the 
domain information for proteins A and B, one could determine the interaction probability 
using the Bayer’s rule, that is

number of DDI, EDDI, denotes single-domain interaction, and it does not include domain 
combination pair DDI, since these types of DDI are not available in InterDom. MDDI stands 
for the matched DDI, and the matching ratio SM is defined as MDDI/EDDI *100%.  
 
Table 1. The putative domain-domain interaction results (NDDI) obtained by the domain 
combination pair approach compared with that of the database InterDom. 
 
In the InterDom comparison study, the DDI matching ratio ranges from 66.3% to 89.5% 
for the seven species. An average matching ratio of 75.7% is obtained, this indicates the 
model is rather sucessiveful. 
3.2 The yeast septin complex 
To verify whether the pre-computed DDI results can provide potential PPI links between 
proteins, three biological pathways, i.e. the septin complex, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway 
and the blood coagulation pathway, are selected for further study. The predicted PPI events 
among those proteins in these three pathways are compared with the experimentally 
determined PPI networks.  
For the first comparison, the yeast septin complex, which composed of six proteins 
(CDC3, CDC10, CDC11, CDC12, GIN4, SHS1), is selected.  Thus, there are 15 (C62) 
possible PPI among the proteins. A PPI link is assumed if the PIP value is larger than or 
equal to 0.1, our method correctly predicted that all six proteins interact with each other, 
that is a prediction accuracy Q of 100% (15/15) is achieved as well as STP and STN. The 
same prediction accuracy is reported by InterDom. In contrast, PreSPI returned an error 
message (PIP_Value = error) for each of the 15 possible interactions. In this case, our 
prediction performed much better than PreSPI. 
The PIP threshold is set at the 0.1 level because this is the least stringent value among the 
three PPI cases we studied. Use of a small PIP threshold would predict more PPI, but most 
of them are false positive interactions. In order to show how the threshold affects the 
prediction accuracy and specificity performance, a higher threshold value of 0.6 is selected 
for further study, and the results are reported in section 3.3 and 3.4 
3.3 The E. coli chemotaxis pathway 
In the second study, the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is selected. Chemotaxis is the 
response of cells to chemical stimuli by directed movement. The chemotaxis pathway, 
obtained from KEGG (Kanehisa et al. 2006), composed of 11 proteins: MCP (consists of 
trg, tap, CheD, CheM), Aer, CheA, CheB, CheR, CheW, CheY, and CheZ. The predicted 
results based on DDI are depicted in Table 2 (a PPI is assumed if the PIP threshold is set to 
0.1 or 0.6). 
Table 2. Predicted number of protein-protein interactions and the statistical measure results 
with PIP threshold of 0.1 and 0.6 in the E. coli chemotaxis pathway, and compared with 
that of PreSPI. 
 
For the chemotaxis pathway, there are 55 (C112) possible interactions among the 11 
proteins. Our prediction returned a PIP value for each of the 55 interactions. PreSPI 
returned only 36 interactions, and the rest are not addressed. The accuracy of our prediction 
encouraging. 
3.6 Order index – the yeast cell cycle DNA damage checkpoint 
The yeast cell cycle DNA damage checkpoint in the G2 phase is selected in this study. In 
this pathway there are 20 regulatory relations among the following 22 proteins or protein 
complexes: Rad17, Rad24, Mec3, Ddc1, Rad9, Mec1, Ctr1, Chk1, Pds1, Rad53, Cdc5, 
(Clb1, Cdc28), Mih1, Cak1, Cks1, Swi5, Sic1, Swe1, (Scf, Met30), Gin4, Hsl1, (Hsl7, 
Hsl1). Since the domain annotation for Mec3, Ddc1, Pds1 and Sic1 are not available (four 
PPI relations are removed), the regulatory relations for Rad17-Rad24, and (Clb1, 
Cdc28)-Cks1 are not clearly defined by KEGG (two more regulatory relations are removed), 
therefore, only 14 relations (the second column in Table 4) among 15 proteins are 
considered in the prediction.  
Among the 14 relations, the relative dependence of Gin4-Swe1 and Hsc1-Swe1 are not 
determined because they have the same AP-order index values, hence, only 12 relations left 
(the third column in Table 4). Among the 12 relations, 7 relations are correctly predicted. 
The seven correct predictions are: Rad9-Mec1, Mec1-Chk1, Mec1-Rad53, 
Cdc5-(Clb1,Cdc28), Mih1-(Clb1,Cdc28), Cak1-(Clb1, Cdc28) and  Swe1-(Clb1,Cdc28). 
Hence, the regulatory order prediction accuracy for the damage checkpoint pathway is 
58.3% (i.e. 7/12). 
3.7 Order index – the yeast cell cycle spindle checkpoint 
For the spindle checkpoint pathway, there are 12 regulatory relations among the 
following 14 proteins or protein complexes: Mps1, (Bub1,Bub3), (Mad1,Mad2,Mad3), 
(APC/C, Cdc20), (APC/C, Cdh1), Cdc14, Swi5, Sic1, Esc5, (Dbf2, Mob1), Dbf20, Tem1, 
Bub2 and Let1. Since the domain annotation for Sic1 and Esc5 are not recorded in the 
SwissProt database, therefore, three of the protein regulatory relations cannot be 
determined. Furthermore, one relation has the same AP-order index value ((APC/C, 
Cdc20)-(APC/C, Cdh1)), hence 8 relations left. The order index method correctly predicted 
seven PPI regulatory order pairs out of the eight relations, these are Mps1-(Bub1,Bub3), 
(Mad1,Mad2,Mad3)-(APC/C,Cdc20), Cdc14-(APC/C, Cdh1), Let1-Tem1, Tem1-Dbf20, 
Cdc14-Swi5, and Bub2-Tem1. Hence, the method achieves a prediction accuracy of 87.5% 
(i.e. 7/8). 
3.8 Order index – the yeast MAPK signaling pathway, starvation 
In this study the yeast starvation, osmolarity and hypotonic shock pathways are selected. 
For the starvation pathway, there are six regulatory relations among the following seven 
proteins, Sho1, Ras2, Cdc42, Ste20, Ste11, Ste7 and Kss1. Among the six relations, the 
relative dependence of Ste7-Kss1 is not determined because it has the same AP-order index 
value. The order index method correctly predicted the regulatory order of the other five PPI 
pairs: Ras2-cdc42, Sho1-Cdc42, Cdc42-Ste20, ste20-ste11, ste11-ste7, ste7-Kss1. The 
method achieves a prediction accuracy of 100% (5/5). 
3.9 Order index – the yeast MAPK signaling pathway, osmolarity 
For the osmolarity pathway, there are eight regulatory relations among the following nine 
proteins: Sho1, Sln1, Ste20, Ypd1, Ste11, Ssk1, Ssk2, Pbs2, and Hog1. Among the eight 
relations, the PBs2-Hog1 relation has the same AP-order index value, hence seven relations 
left. The order index method correctly predicted the six PPI relations: Sho1-Ste20, 
binomial probability distribution test, the hypothesis t-test rejects the null hypothesis at a 
99% level. 
 
3.12 A web-based service for PPI and regulatory order prediction  
The predicted domain-domain interaction results are available at 
http://210.70.82.82/kzbio2/r_ap.php. Several query interfaces are implemented to facilitate 
data display, such as the DDI, PIP, PIP query and network reconstruction services. For 
instance, the PIP query service allows the user to input two proteins’ Swissprot 
(Boeckmann et al. 2003) ID and get the probability of their interaction, i.e. the PIP value. In 
case the actual Swissprot ID is not known, user can input domain’s PfamA ID, the system 
could return the predicted probability of the protein interaction. Furthermore, the network 
service allows the user to reconstruct PPI network, and predict the regulatory order of a PPI. 
To reconstruct the PPI network, user can either input a set of proteins or domains IDs, the 
system returns a text file where putative PPI interactions are predicted. The predicted PPI 
network can be visualized by reading the output file using Cytoscape (Shannon et al. 2003). 
We also have set up a web-based service for the public to use the AP-order index method 
for prediction, which is available at http://210.70.82.82/kzbio2/oi.php. For instance, if one 
wants to determine the regulatory order of Aer and (CheA, CheW), prepare the following 
line as an input,  
PF08447,PF00672,PF00015  PF01627,PF02895,PF02518,PF01584 
where the first and second columns denote the PfamA annotations of the Aer and (CheA, 
CheW) proteins.  
Paste the above line in the box provided in the AP-order index web page, give a name for 
the output file, select E.coil under the species manual, and press the send button. The 
platform will return a file which states the prediction result (either A regulates B or not able 
to determine the regulatory order). 
 
4. Conclusion 
The domain combination pair approach is employed to derive putative protein DDI from 
the PPI database DIP. To evaluate the prediction performance of the approach, the DDI 
predicted results are compared with that of the database InterDom, where an average 
matching ratio of 75.7% can be achieved (assuming the Jan. 16, 2006 version of DIP).  
Three PPI networks are chosen to test the prediction accuracy of our computation.  The 
yeast septin complex, and the blood coagulation pathways are reconstructed with a much 
better accuracy and true negative specificity than another study. For the E. coli chemotaxis 
pathway study, comparable PPI prediction accuracy is obtained whereas more PPI and a 
better true negative specificity are obtained in our prediction. This indicated the merit of 
our calculations. Furthermore, an entropy-like quantity, so called AP-order index, based on 
DDI data, is introduced to predict the regulatory order for a PPI. The prediction accuracy of 
this method is demonstrated for six PPI pathways. It is found that this method can achieve a 
prediction accuracy of 80.5%. This implies that the order index is a very reliable parameter 
to determine the regulatory order of PPI. 
There are two major obstacles for the PPI and regulatory order calculations: (i) many 
proteins do not have complete PfamA domain annotations, and (ii) there is the missing DDI 
information problem. Much further experimental works are still needed to resolve prior two 
problems.

Deliberations on memory mechanisms often seem to proceed on at least three independent 
tracks. One of these involves biochemical mechanisms for plasticity, including feedback loops and 
cellular activation. Space is another dimension, and is the arena for interactions between synapses, 
and propagation of signals between synapses, dendrites, and the cell body. Finally, electrical 
activity is a function of cell as well as network dynamics, and here too feedback may play a role 
through reverberating activity in network loops. It is an interesting process to develop models that 
impinge on all of these levels, because of the wide range of timescales, numerical techniques, and 
sheer computational load. It is especially tricky to get parameters for such models. I will describe 
a study where we have used coupled electrical and biochemical compartmental modeling, and 
weeded out several candidate models by comparing their predictions to our experiments. The 
surviving models incorporate chemical, spatial and electrical ingredients. They exhibit 
network-activity controlled single-cell reverberating activation, with interesting spatial 
consequences. We suggest that this is a form of short-term and spatially defined memory. It sits at 
the interface between individual synapses and dendrites, and also between network and cellular 
attributes of memory.

“Why bio-imaging, i.e. real time fluorescence imaging?" Currently, this is a topic of great 
interest in the bioscience community. Many molecules involved in signal transduction have been 
identified, and the hierarchy among those molecules has also been elucidated. It is not uncommon 
to see a signal transduction diagram in which arrows are used to link molecules to show enzyme 
reactions and intermolecular interactions. To obtain a further understanding of a signal 
transduction system, however, the diagram must contain the three axes in space as well as a fourth 
dimension, time, because all events are controlled ingeniously in space and time. Since the 
isolation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the bioluminescent jellyfish in 1992 and later 
with its relatives, researchers have been awaiting the development of a tool, which enables the 
direct visualization of biological functions. This has been increasingly enhanced by the marriage 
of GFP with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence cross-correlation 
spectroscopy (FCCS), and is further expanded upon by the need for "post-genomic analyses." It is 
not my intent to discourage the trend seeking the visualization of biological function. I would like 
to propose that it is time to evaluate the true asset of "bio-imaging" for its potential and limitations 
in order to utilize and truly benefit from this novel technique.

Bacterial gene networks are highly plastic, allowing radical reconnections at the summit of the 
表 Y04 
analysis, flux equates to growth rate. In category 2 experiments, the levels of individual gene 
products are altered, and the impact on the flux is measured. We have used competition analyses 
between the complete set of heterozygous yeast deletion mutants to reveal genes encoding 
proteins with high flux control coefficients. 
  For the bottom-up approach, the initial problem is one of systems identification. While a lot of 
time is currently spent debating the question “What is Systems Biology?”, why (in an organism 
where we know so much about its biochemistry, physiology, and cell biology as S. cerevisiae) 
should it be a problem to identify the biological sub-systems that must be fully characterised and 
built into a comprehensive model of the eukaryotic cell? This problem arises because we have 
previously studied these biological systems in isolation and in a rigorously reductionist fashion. 
Now, we must study them as parts of an integrated whole. The problem is that our current view of, 
say, a metabolic or signal transduction pathway is often two-dimensional (rather than 
four-dimensional) and is frequently poorly integrated, if at all, with other cellular pathways. Thus 
our view of the network of metabolic pathways may not be the same as the yeast’s. In order to 
gain a “yeast’s eye view”, we have coupled flux balance analysis with both metabolomics and 
genetics. Although the initial aim of these approaches is the identification of the ‘natural’ 
metabolic systems of yeast, the principles involved should be more widely applicable to the 
problem of biological systems identification.

八、與會心得 
The Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference 2007 is an annual forum for exploring 
research, development and novel applications of Bioinformatics which is held at the 
University of Hong Kong, from Jan. 14 to 17. 
The scientific program of APBC 2007 included 3 keynote talks, 3 tutorials, 35 oral 
presentations, 112 poster presentations and a HP industrial sessions as well. 
The symposium has received 104 papers and each submitted paper was reviewed.  All 
accepted papers had at least 2 positive recommendations.  The program committee accepts 
approximately 33% of papers, that is a total of 35 papers.  A variety of papers was 
presented at this conference and the topics include protein structures study, motif search, 
micro-array analysis, proteomics, pathways, networks and evolution study.   
I had two poster presentation on Jan. 16, 15:00 p.m. Title of my two posters 
presentation are “Applications of Domain-Domain Interaction in Pathways Study ”, and 
“Predicting Putative Human Mirna Precursor Candidates Associated with Promoter Regions 
and CpG Islands ”. On the other hand, I had attended most of the talks during the four days 
conferences. 
In my personal opinion, bioinformatics researches are growing very rapidly, and it is 
moving into the areas such as data integration, gene micro-array analysis, proteomics and 
system biology. There are several good tutorials, talks and posters presented in this 
conference.  I will highlight their main interesting results in below.

Selecting Genes with Dissimilar Discrimination Strength for Sample Class Prediction 
by Zhipeng Cai, Randy Goebel, Mohammad Salavatipour, Yi Shi, Lizhe Xu, Guohui Lin 
z Similar gene expression level does not give useful information 
z Gene selection methods carefully define a function to score the differential levels of 
gene expression inder a varity of conditions, in order to identify top-ranked genes 
z Such method suffer because some genes have very similar expression patterns so using 
them all in classification is largely redundant 
z These genes can prevent the consideration of other individually-less but 
collectively-more differentially expressed genes 
z The authors proposed to cluster genes in terms of their class discrimination strength and 
to limit the number of selected genes per cluster 
z The authors showed by experiments on two cancer microarray datasets that their 
methods identify gene subsets which collectively have significantly higher 
classification accuracies 
Attended the poster session. 
表 Y04 
z The rosetta structure prediction algorithm was used to make sequence based structure 
predications for the protein 
z Then screened the models produced by Rosetta for agreement with the helix skeleton

amino-acids in the sequences 
 
Fitting Protein Chains to Cubic Lattice is NP-Complete 
by Jan Manuch, Daya Gaur 
z It is known that folding a protein chain into the cubic lattice is an NP-complete 
problem. Given a 3D fold of a protein chain (the alpha carbon coordinates), the authors 
want to find the closest lattice approximation fo this fold. This problem has been 
studied under names such as “lattice approximation of a protein chain”, “the protein 
chain fitting problem” and “building protein lattice models”. The authors show that this 
problem is NP-complete for the cubic lattice with side 3.8A and the coordinate root 
mean-square deviation. 
 
Inferring a Chemical Structure from a Feature Vector Based on Frequency of Labeled Paths 
and Small Fragments 
by Tatsuya Akutsu, Daiji Fukagawa 
z This paper proposes algorithms for inferring a chemical structure form a feature vector 
based on frequency of labeled paths and small fragments, where this inference problem 
has a potential application to druh design. 
z Chemical structures are modeled as trees or tree-like structures. 
z The inference problems for these kinds of structures can be solved in polynomial time 
using dynamic programming-based algorithms. A branch-bound type algorithm is also 
proposed. 
z The result suggests that the algorithm can solve the inference problem in a few or 
few-tens of seconds for moderate size chemical compounds. 
 
session 5 – mapping and disease talks 
Exact and Heuristic Approaches for Identifying Disease-Associated SNP Motifs 
by Gaofeng Huang, Peter Jeavons, and Dominic Kwiatkowski 
z Some combinations of SNPs in the human genome are known to increase the risk of 
certain complex genetic diseases. The authors formulates the problem of identifying 
such disease-associated SNP  motifs as a combinatorial optimization problem and 
shows it to be NP-hard. Computational results are given to demonstrate that these 
approaches are sufficiently effective to support ongoing biological research. 
 
Genotype-Based Case-Control Analysis, Violation of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, and

De Novo Peptide Sequencing for Mass Spectra Based on Multi-Charge Strong Tags 
by Kang Ning, Ket Fah Chong, Hon Wai Leong 
z The authors presents an improved algorithm for de novo sequencing of multi-charge mass 
spectra. A simple de novo algorithm, called GBST (greedy algorithm with best strong tag) 
was proposed and was shown to produce good results for spectra with charge larger than two.
 
Complexities and Algorithms for Glycan Structure Sequencing using Tandem Mass Spectrometry 
by Baozhen Shan, Bin Ma, Kaizhong Zhang, Gilles Lajoie 
z The authors showed that glycan de novo sequencing is NP-hard. The authors provide a 
heuristic algorithm and develop a software program to solve the problem in practical case. 
Experiments on real MS/MS data of glycopeptides demonstrate that the authors’ heuristic 
algorithm gives satisfactory results on practical data. 
 
Semi-supervised Pattern Learning for Extracting Relations from Bioscience Texts 
by Shilin Ding, Minlie Huang, Xiaoyan Zhu 
z The authors proposed a semi-supervised model to combine both unlabeled and labeled data 
for the pattern learning procedure. First a large amount of unlabeled data is used to generate a 
raw pattern set. Then it is refined in the evaluating phase by incorporating the domain 
knowledge provided by a relatively small labeled data. It is showed that labeled data when 
used in conjunction with the unlabeled data can considerably improve the learning accuracy. 
 
Flow Model of the Protein-protein Interaction Network for Finding Credible Interactions 
by Masanori Arita, Kiyoshi Asai, Kinya Okada 
z The authors proposed the relative reliability score for protein-protein interaction (PPI) as an 
intrinsic characteristic of global topology in the PPI network. The score is calculated as the 
dominant eigenvector of an adjacency matrix and represents the steady state of the network 
flow. By using this reliability score as  cut-off threshold from noisy Y2H PPI data, the 
credible interactions were extracted with better or comparable performance of previously 
proposed methods which were also based on the network topology.
