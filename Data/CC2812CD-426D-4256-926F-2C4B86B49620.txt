1. Introduction 
Hydrocarbon-fueled catalytic micro- or mini-scale combustors have recently 
become the focus of intense research efforts [1, 2], as they can reliably supply the 
necessary thermal power for a variety of portable power generation systems with 
demonstrated energy densities considerably higher than those obtained with Li-ion 
batteries [3]. From the thermodynamic point of view a combustor creates a 
high-temperature energy reservoir that can be used as a power source for various 
applications such as the micro-gas turbine [4] and thermoelectric or 
thermo-photovoltaic power generation system [5-7]. With a size reduction 
micro-combustors have different problems compared to the conventional power 
sources such as high quenching distance, radical quenching and non-uniform 
temperature distribution [8]. The high surface to volume ratio of the micro-combustor 
particularly increases the heat loss and may cause combustion extinction [9-10]. 
Suitable thermal management and balance between the flow residence and chemical 
reaction times are necessary to obtain stable combustion in a micro- combustor [11]. 
Because the energy supply is the key component in micro-power generators, it is 
crucial to explore the combustion characteristics as the combustor size is reduced. 
 
The development of miniaturized, high energy density fuel cells for portable 
devices is an active research area. The major issue faced with the fuel cells is the fuel 
supply. Hydrogen is expected to be the most important fuel for fuel cells because it is 
the cleanest and the reaction products produce no pollution to the environment.  
Many processes such hydrogen reforming from hydrocarbon fuels have been 
developed and studied extensively [12]. Because steam reforming for hydrogen 
production is an endothermic reaction, energy must be supplied to the reformer to 
activate the methanol conversion. For the compact reformer design, recent studies 
have proposed integrating the catalytic combustor with the reformer and vaporizer to 
form a single hydrogen production unit [13-21]. In such design the combustor plays 
an important role because the steam reforming performance is determined by the 
combustor performance. The combustor must release enough energy for the 
vaporization and reforming reaction. Quick start-up for hydrogen production is also 
an important issue in the practical fuel cell use.  
Various fuels can be used for combustion in the integrated hydrogen production 
unit reactor. Park et al. [13], Won et al. [14] and Chein et al. [15] used methanol as the 
fuel in their methanol-steam reformer design. The advantage of this choice is that only 
methanol is required for the entire reactor operation. However, these experiments 
indicated that the reactor needs a long time to reach the 250~300℃ temperature range 
for methanol-steam reforming. The reason for this slow start-up is the large amount of

were inserted into the tube occupying a length of 70 mm at the middle of the tube. 
The catalyst spheres were held firmly by two pieces of quartz cotton placed at both 
ends of the catalyst-occupied region. The quartz cotton also served as a device for 
inducing uniform flow over the reaction zone because of its porous nature. Because 
the qurtaz tube is frigible, it is not easy to insert a thermocouples into the combustor 
to measure the bulk gas temerpature. To characterize the combustor performance, we 
used the temeprature variation along the combustor outer wall, measured by attaching 
seven thermocouples (P1 to P7) with equal spacing of 11.5 mm along the combustor 
outer wall. There was a temeprature difference between the combustor outer wall and 
bulk gas flow in the combustor because of the heat loss due to external convective 
heat transfer and thermal resistance of the combustor wall. Athough it is expected that 
the wall temeprature would be lower than the gas flow in the tube, it can still be used 
to reflect the combustion characteristics.  
 
Figure 2 shows the experimental setup for the combustion perforamnce 
measurement. A thermocouple holder was designed to ensure good contact between 
the thermocouples and quartz wall. All thermocouples were calibrated in a thermostat 
water bath with the accuracy within 1 K. The methanol/air mixture supply to the 
combustor was accompanied using a methanol-air bubbler similar to those used in the 
studies of Ma et al. [22] and Karim et al. [5]. Since the both methanol and air were 
kept at room temperature during the mixing process, the methanol/air mixture at the 
combustor inlet can be regarded as at room temperature.   
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Methanol/air supply 
As shown in Figure 2, the methanol/air mixture supply to the combustor was 
achieved using the methanol-air bubbler. The air was injected into the methanol liquid 
enriched with methanol vapor. Depending on the air flow rate Qin, the amount of 
methanol contained in the methanol/air mixture would be different. During the test, 
the methanol mass in the bubbler decreased gradually in a transient process. Because 
the methanol decrease rate is quite slow an averaged methanol mass flow rate can be 
evaluated based on the methanol mass decrease in the bubbler and test time. Using the 
averaged methanol mass flow rate the equivalence ratio of the methanol/air mixture 
used in the test can be evaluated. Figure 3 shows the equivalence ratio as function of 
the air flow rate. For an air flow rate ranging from 100 to 600 sccm the equivalence 
ratio varies from 1.8 to 0.97 in our methanol-air bubbler design. Based on the result 
shown in Figure 3, a fuel-rich combustion occurs when the air flow rate is low. The 
combustion is fuel-lean when the air flow rate is high. 
  4
of Karim et al. [5]. Temperature increases with air flow rate is primarily due to the 
increase in combustion energy released which is roughly proportional to the air flow 
rate. Without any insulation, the temperature decrease along the combustor wall may 
be attributed to the heat loss from the combustor to the environment due to external 
heat convection.  
 
Because combustion takes place in the near entrance region and the catalyst in the 
combustor downstream may be inactive, it is therefore suggested that the combustor 
length can be shortened. This leads to a more compact design when the combustor is 
integrated with the power source or hydrogen production unit which relies on the 
energy supply from the combustion.  
 
To examine the heat loss effect to the environment on the combustion 
performance, the time-dependent temperature variations at seven locations were 
measured when the combustor is wrapped with insulation material. Under the same 
operation conditions as those in Figures 5 and 6, the results are shown in Figures 7 
and 8, respectively. The transient temperature variations for the insulated combustor 
are quite different from those without insulation. For each measured location and air 
flow rate the wall temperature increases to a high temperature monotonically with 
time and reaches a steady-state value without any temperature decrease. The time 
required for reaching the steady state is longer than that in the un-insulated combustor. 
By referring to the temperature measured at 60 minutes as the steady-state 
temperature, the steady-state temperature variations for various air flow rates along 
the insulated combustor length are shown in Figure 8. Compared with Figure 6 higher 
temperature can be obtained for the insulated combustor case under the same air flow 
rate. For the insulated combustor the wall temperature increases from the combustor 
inlet, reaches a maximum value and then decreases along the combustor downstream. 
Theoretically, both the bulk gas and combustor wall should reach a constant 
temperature when the wall is perfectly insulated [28]. The reason for this result may 
be attributed to the imperfect insulation applied to the combustor. The results shown 
above indicated that heat loss from the combustor plays an important role in 
governing mini-scale combustor performance.  
 
3.3 Catalyst load effect      
 Figure 9 the catalyst load effect on the combustion performance using the 
steady-state temperature distributions for both insulated and non-insulated combustors. 
As shown in Figure 9 no significant difference was found for the temperature 
variation along the combustor with three different Pt loads. This means that the

where  is the molar concentration of methanol,  is the pre-exponential 
factor and n  is the reaction order. As pointed out by Pasel et al. [24], the 
pre-exponential factor, reaction order and activation energy depend on the degree of 
methanol conversion. As suggested by Karim et al. [5], a zero activation energy is 
assumed to give the self-ignition combustion. In this study, we adjust the 
pre-exponential factor and reaction order based on our experimental data. Using 
Q0=600 sccm as the reference case, it is found that when  and are given as,

the best fit between numerical result and experimental data can be obtained. It should 
be noted that we do not attempt to get exactly fit between the experimental data and 
numerical prediction by using the simplified reaction model but focusing on the 
general temperature variation characteristics and the heat loss effect on the combustor 
performance. 
 
Figure 11 shows the typical temperature distributions of the combustor predicted 
by the numerical model for various air flow rates with =5 W/m2K. There is a hot 
spot near the entrance of the combustor and the temperature increases with the 
increase in air flow rate. These results agree with the experimental observations 
shown in Figures 4 and 5. To examine the external heat loss effect, variations of bulk 
gas temperature along the combustor centerline and combustor outer wall temperature 
are shown in Figure 12 for varied in the 0 to 5 W/m2K range. As shown in Figure 
12 both the bulk gas and wall temperatures depend significantly on the air flow rate 
and the external heat transfer coefficient. For all cases studied it is seen that there is a 
high temperature increase for the bulk gas in the entrance region due to combustion 
energy release. The combustor wall absorbs heat and its temperature is raised to a 
high value from the combustor inlet but is lower than that of the bulk gas. At the 
combustor downstream the temperature decreases to a lower value due to heat 
absorbed by the combustor wall and heat loss to the environment. For the perfect 
insulated case with =0 W/m2K, both gas and combustor wall temperatures reach a 
constant value due to no energy loss to the environment. As the heat transfer 
coefficient increases the temperature decreases significantly even though the external 
heat transfer coefficients are small.
