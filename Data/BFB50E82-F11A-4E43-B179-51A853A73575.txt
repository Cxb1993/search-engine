latest situation of traffic. The forecast information should be renewed with the 
updated traffic data. 
 
This research will develop accident duration forecasting model and travel time 
forecasting model which involve three feature reduction technique issues in data 
processing stage. The feature reduction methods will be expected to decrease the data 
noise in forecasting model and improve the model performance in prediction. 
 
1.3 Research issues 
This research plans to build accident duration forecasting model and travel time 
forecasting model with feature reduction methods in data processing stage. The 
estimation model develops a functional relation between real-time traffic data as the 
independent variables and real accident duration time or travel time as the dependent 
variable. After the model is developed, the forecasted accident duration and 
forecasted travel time can be provided by plugging in real-time traffic data into the 
equation whenever desirable. 
 
As shown in Figure 1-1, to build the highway accident duration forecasting 
model and travel time forecasting with data feature reduction techniques is the target. 
After realizing the problem, the relevant literatures are reviewed, such as the accident 
duration, travel time and data feature reduction. The traffic data collection depends on 
the needs of this study and the existing data resources. Through the data analysis, the 
suitable data processes for the data, the adequate variables and the fitting data fusion 
techniques can be chosen for model building. 
 
In model building, three methods for feature reduction will be used to smooth the 
data noise to the model. According to the model effect, the best method will be 
recommended.  
 
The first year, this study analyzes the traffic environment, collect the traffic data, 
build the data process procedure and conduct the preliminary models with no data 
feature reduction, composition methods and cluster method. The second year, the 
feedback will used to adjust this study procedure and technique application. The 
model with feature reduction by GA selection methods was built in the second year. 
The effect analysis of data feature reduction method was addressed in the two year.

1.4 Limitation 
In this research, the travel time used in model building and evaluation is collected 
from the on-board GPS installed on the bus. The accident data only consider the data 
which significantly affect the normal traffic flow. Therefore, the predicted travel time 
of this model is more suitable for bus and the accident duration forecast model only 
can use to forecast the accident which significant affect the normal traffic flow.  
 
1.5 Main features 
 This research will adopt the existed resources and transfer the raw traffic data to 
the traffic information by the data fusion and data reduction procedure. The main 
features of this research are addressed as follows.  
 
1. User-oriented 
This research considers the travels’ needs in developing travel time model 
and accident duration model. On highway, the incidents that travelers most care 
about are the accident. During the accident, the travelers concern the latest 
situation and the influence of the accident. By this sequential update of accident 
duration model, the latest predicted information can be provided to the travelers 
during the accident. In order to fulfill the every possible O-D pairs of traveler, 
partitioning the freeway into links for modeling the travel time forecasting model 
is considered a proper approach. Once a link travel time forecasting model has 
been built, the forecasted path travel time can be obtained by summing the 
forecasted link travel time. The forecast travel time information can reduce the 
travelers’ uncertain feeling about the traffic, especially during the accident. This 
travel time model considers the influence of accident and mirror real traffic 
situation from user orientation. 
 
2. Sequential update of forecasting information 
Up to present, most researches about accident duration forecasting focus on 
building the static forecasting mode. The accident take a period of time from the 
start to the end. In the process of the travel or the accident, the traffic still 
changes continuously with time. The accident duration forecasting information 
needs be updated with the traffic change. 
 
3. Data fusion and data feature reduction 
With advance traffic data collection techniques, a variety of traffic data can 
be collected. Therefore, how to carefully and appropriately use the traffic data to

2. Literature Reviews 
There are many issues related to this study, such as travel time, accident duration, data 
fusion and data feature reduction. Section 2.1 reviews freeway travel time researches 
and compares the methodologies, data sources, model inputs, model performance and 
main features among the researches. Accident duration studies are reviewed in 
Section 2.2. Section 2.3 introduces the data fusion technique and artificial neural 
network. The issues related to data feature reduction are addressed in Section 2.4. 
Review of freeway travel time project is in Section 2.5.  
 
2.1 Freeway travel time 
For travel time research, partitioning the roadway into several sections is a crucial 
procedure. The primary requirement is that the traffic environment and geometry 
should be similar within each section and dissimilar among sections. It is generally 
assumed that the path travel time is the addition of the travel times estimated for 
various sections. In Chen and Chiens’ study [2001], it is shown that under recurrent 
traffic conditions, the direct measurement of path-based travel times, rather than 
section-based travel times, could generate more accurate predictions. Section-based 
methods, on the other hand, may be sensitive to unforeseen accidents. 
 
Developing a travel time forecasting model often follows one of two approaches 
[Wan & Nakamura, 2002]. One uses some analysis methodology to build a relation 
between the travel time and relevant traffic data, such as speed, volumes, occupancy 
and historical estimated travel time [Park & Rilett, 1998; Palacharla & Nelson, 1999; 
Krikke, 2002; Chien et al., 2002; Zhang & Rice, 2003]. Another uses an estimation 
methodology to calculate the travel time based on distance and speed [D’angelo et al., 
1999; Lindveld et al., 2002; Huisken & Berkum, 2002; Coifman, 2002; Li et al., 
2006]. Representative studies on highway travel time forecasting in the past few years 
are summarized in Table 2-1. After assessing the methods employed in the literature, 
the analysis method is considered more reliable than the estimation method and is 
adopted for this research. 
 
The variables considered in developing travel time forecasting models are 
diverse. They include traffic volume [Palacharla & Nelson, 1999; Chien et al., 2002], 
occupancy rate [D’angelo et al., 1999; Palacharla & Nelson, 1999], vehicle speed 
[Cortes, et al., 2002; Lint, et al., 2003], delays [Chien et al., 2002] and historical 
travel time [Park & Rilett, 1999; Dharia & Adeli, 2003; Xu & Barth, 2006; Dion & 
Rakha, 2006]. This implies that all of these variables can be used to some extent to 
describe the traffic situation. Actually, spending a long time to collect data is difficult

Park & Rolett [1998][1999] and Huisken & Berkum [2002] respectively 
compared the performance among different algorithms in highway travel time 
forecasting. The MAPE has been chosen as the primary criterion for model evaluation, 
as shown in equation 2-1. Typical MAPE values for data and their assessment are 
shown in Table 2-2 [Lewis, 1982]. As the MAPE becomes closer to 0, the forecasted 
value becomes more accurate. As shown in Table 2-3, ANN shows better performance 
than other algorithms in modeling and forecasting.

As the most prominent approach presently used for solving complex problems, 
ANNs have been recently gaining popularity in transportation studies [Dougherty, 
1997; Wei & Chen, 2001]. Many studies have demonstrated that ANNs have the 
potential to accurately predict traffic conditions on freeways [Wan & Nakamura, 2002; 
Huisken & Berkum, 2002; Chien et al., 2002].  
 
After assessing the methods in our literature review, we found that the analysis 
 12 
three models cover the whole accident period, the forecast is not continuous from the 
start of prediction to the accident cleared. In traveler information services, forecasting 
duration by stage does not meet the user’s need.  
 
Wei and Lee [2005] developed the accident duration model by the data fusion 
techniques. This model provides a forecasted duration at the accident notification 
moment. The MAPE of forecasted results of the accident duration are mostly under 
20%. By the factor sensitivity analysis, the significant factors can be identified. The 
factors, time of day, number of vehicles & vehicle type involved in accident and 
geometry, have high significance in conducting the duration model. 
 
Previous studies found several highly significant factors for us in developing an 
accident duration model. Different from the hazard-based model and the regression 
approaches, the studies examine the data fusion techniques in modeling. Additionally, 
we consider traveler’s need and forecast the accident duration from the accident 
notification to the accident cleared. 
 
2.3 Data fusion with artificial neural network 
Data fusion is an evolving technique concerned with the problem of how to combine 
data from multiple sensors in order to make inferences about a physical event, activity, 
or situation [Hall, 1992]. The procedure of data fusion includes preliminary data 
filtering, data collections management, data alignment, association analysis, position 
fusion, identity fusion and situation assessment, as show in Figure 2-2. 
 
First, the existing sources of data collection must be evaluated comprehensively. 
According to the needs of information service, the criteria of the data filtering and 
data alignment can be performed. Analyzing the association among the collected data 
is usually performed by the parametric association method or the estimation technique. 
Through the data analysis, the suitable variables can be chosen for position fusion and 
identity fusion. The position fusion associate data into sets of the data belonging to 
the same dynamic entity and combine the data to estimate the location and velocity of 
an entity. In the identity fusion, the mission is combining the data from sensors to 
establish the identity of objects and developing a model to fuse the searched data to 
the information. Physical models, feature-based inference techniques and 
cognitive-based models are the three major identity fusion approaches. In order to 
comprehend the reliability of the fused information, assessing the information 
accuracy will be included.  
 
 14 
adequately represented by the ANN models [Chen & Chien, 2001; Wei & Lee, 2003]. 
Therefore, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as the key technique 
to develop our data fusion model.  
 
The ANN approach is a data-driven, self-adaptive, nonlinear methodology. 
Originally the design of ANN was motivated by considering an abstraction of the 
neural architecture of the human brain. First attempts to use the underlying theories 
for computational purposes came as early as in 1943 [McCulloch and Pitts, 1943]. An 
ANN consists of a number of data processing layers interconnected in a network. 
Each layer is a computational mechanism with mathematical functions. A layer 
receives input values from one layer and aggregates input values based on an input 
function. Then, the layer generates output values based on an output function. The 
output values are then routed to other layers, as designed by the architecture of the 
network. 
 
With the publication of the backpropagation algorithm, the interest of the 
research community in neural networks has been increasing up to this day. Although 
work continued throughout it received relatively little attention until the last several 
years, during which a growing interest in this kind of adaptive modeling technique has 
emerged. Some reasons for this fact may be found in the availability of faster 
computing facilities, the development of parallel computing architectures, a better 
documentation of ANN-related theory, and the increasing number of successful 
real-world implementations. 
 
Figure 2-3 shows the backpropagation algorithm of ANN networks. When 
inputting variables into the network, the weights from input layer to hidden layer are 
calculated. Through the transfer function in the hidden layer, the input data are 
rescaled as inputs to the output layer. When the relationship between the input and 
output variables is nonlinear, a hidden layer helps in extracting higher level features 
and facilitates generalization of outputs.

2.4 Data feature rediction 
In many research, high-dimensional data are involved, because large feature vectors 
are generated to be able to describe complex objects and to distinguish them. But 
large feature vectors may cause some disadvantages to the model, such as more time 
in model training and more noises in modeling. To avoid these problems, the feature 
vectors must be reduced. The advantages of data simplification are as follows. 
 
1. Saving the computing time 
Simpler data, a result of the data-reduction process, can hopefully lead to a 
reduction in the time taken for model training. In Lee’s research [1997], smaller 
dimensional presentation not only saves the computing time but also reduces memory 
and storage requirements, and hardware implementation costs in object recognition.  
 
2. Improving the performances 
Irrelevant data may mislead a learning process and a final model, while 
redundant data may complicate the task of learning and cause unexpected results. 
Penaloza and Welch [1996] select the fewer features to classify polar scenes and the 
classification accuracy is increased to 93.4%. 
 
The way to reduce the data feature includes feature composition, cluster and 
feature selection. Three methods are described as follows. 
 
2.4.1 Composition 
Feature composition is dependent on knowledge of the application, and an 
interdisciplinary approach to feature composition tasks produces significant 
improvement in the preparation of data. For example, two variables, the height and 
the weight, can be used to present the body type. The height divided by the weight 
makes the ratio of the body types, and two variables can be combined as one variable. 
There are a lot of feature composition methods, such as hashing, principal component 
analysis [Shie, 2003] and entropy [Wu, 2004]. 
 
2.4.2 Cluster 
Cluster analysis is a set of methodologies for automatic classification of samples into 
a number of groups using a measure of association, so that the samples in one group 
are similar and samples belonging to different groups are not similar [Sharma, 1996]. 
The distance between the two instances is used as a measure of similarity.

installed at 0.5 to 9 kilometer intervals. TANFB also sets up a few automatic vehicle 
identifiers (AVI) near the signboards and important interchanges. AVI collects the 
actual travel time to calibrate the estimated travel time. 
 
The Taiwanese government also constructed the ETC system using in-vehicle 
transponder that incorporates integrated circuit card in 2003 when the annual average 
daily traffic volumes for highways increased from 1.0 million in 1996 to 1. 4 million 
in 2002 [Ministry of Transportation and Communications, 2006]. The construction 
was completed in 2005 and the system has administered by a company called Far 
Eastern Electronic Toll Collection since February 2006. As of June 2006, the ETC 
system is installed on 22 toll booths on highways in Taiwan and over 170,000 drivers 
fitted transponders in their vehicles. It is expected that the demand for transponders in 
Taiwan will be over 6 million in 2010 when the ETC system is fully administered on 
all highways around the country by that time. ETC can collect more accurate and 
reliable travel time of vehicles. Probe vehicle data and historical data are also 
considered to further enhance the estimation procedure in the near future. 
 
b) Information display 
The target users of travel time information services are the travelers of medium to 
long range. Therefore the contents of predicted travel time should be flexible. The 
information displayed on the travel time signboard will be rounded up to 300sec 
(5min) interval.  
 
c) System deployment 
TANFB installed ten signboards for travel time information in the central area of 
Taiwan. In the initial stage of development, the signboards are sited after the toll 
plazas on National Freeway No. 1 and No. 3. The spacing of travel time signboard is 
about 30 km. Figure 2-4 shows the signboard already in place. The travel time 
signboard in central area operated officially at late 2005. In the southern area, the 
travel time signboard built during 2005 and 2007. TANFB expects to complete the 
project of integrated traffic management system at 2008 for the entire 
Freeway/Expressway network. 
 
Before the operation of travel time signboard, TANFB had set up a website 
(www.freeway.gov.tw) which can provide the predicted travel time by inputting the 
origin and destination interchanges.  
 20 
2.5.2 Travel time information in Japan 
In Japan, travel time information is provided on the Metropolitan Expressway using a 
variety of media, including Information Website (www.jartic.or.jp), Travel Time 
Information Board, Metropolitan Expressway Radio and Vehicle Information and 
Communication System (VICS). Figure 2-5 shows the signboard. The predictive 
travel time will be calculated by estimation based on distance and speed. The average 
speed of traffic is collected from loop vehicle detectors which are installed at 0.3 km 
intervals. The unit of information in display is 300sec (5min). This system provides 
the forecasted travel time between any two important interchanges. The travel time of 
the path is less than 3300sec (55 minutes) [Hiroshi et al., 2001].  
 
 
Figure 2-5. Travel time information signboard in Japan 
 
2.5.3 Travel time information in USA 
In USA, several cities had provided the travel time information, such as Los Angeles, 
Chicago, Seattle, San Antonio and Ocean city. Table 2-4 shows the summary of each 
information system. Most systems provide the path travel time, speed, distances and 
congestion status and display the information by words. Usually, the origin and 
destination interchange of the paths are given by the information system. Only in Los 
Angeles and San Antonio, user can choose the any origin and destination for a trip to 
obtain the customized O-D path travel time. The update time of forecasted travel time 
is very short between 1 min and 5 min. Therefore, the unit of output information 
display is minute. The development of these information systems are leaded by the 
public sector.  
 
 22 
 
In San Antonio, America, the travel time information is provided by the 
TransGuide system. In this system, the media to provide the information include the 
Travel Time Information Board and the Internet Website 
(www.transguide.dot.state.tx.us). Figure 2-6 shows the signboard. By TransGuide, the 
forecasted travel time between main interchanges can be available. Users can choose 
the origin and destination for a trip of less than 30 minutes (1800sec) and the website 
will compute and display the forecasted travel time immediately. The predictive travel 
time is computed by estimation based on distance and speed. The average speed of 
traffic is collected from loop vehicle detectors which are installed at 2 or 3 mile 
intervals. The predicted travel time is displayed by range within 2min (120sec). This 
system provides the forecasted travel time between any two important interchanges. 
The travel time of the path is less than 50 minutes (3000sec). 
 
 
Figure 2-6. Travel time information signboard in San Antonio, America 
 
In Ocean city, research organization, University of Maryland, is one of main 
departments to develop the traffic monitoring systems. This system provides the 
forecasted travel time of 4 links between Bay Bridge and Ocean City, as shown in 
Figure 2-7. The predicted travel time is displayed by range within 4 min (240sec).

3. Data Analysis 
This study selected the southern part of the No.1 national freeway in Taiwan, which is 
from An-ding interchange to Lu-jhu interchange, as the experiment site. This double 
lane site has a length of 27.2 km, 1 toll stations, 3 interchanges and 2 system 
interchange, as shown in Figure 3-1. The southbound also has 7 VD’s, and a speed 
limit of 100 km/hr. The raw data are collected for 24 hours a day over a 6-month 
period from December 2004 to September 2005 (not include February, March, April, 
May 2005). The time period which covers weekdays/weekends and peak/non-peak 
hours adequately reflects real traffic conditions. In this period, the road lane between 
An-ding and Lu-jhu were not broadened as 3 lanes. Therefore, this study did not 
consider the data and traffic scenario with 3 lanes.

3.2 VD data 
The VD data and incident data are recorded with a preset time interval. From Taiwan 
Area National Freeway Bureau (TANFB), the VD data are recorded and accumulated 
every 300sec for each lane. The VD records the time, the vehicle running speed, the 
vehicle volume and the vehicle occupancy. The VD data in original form are shown in 
Table 3-3. Although the VD can recode the traffic data every minute, the quantity of 
traffic data is too huge to storage. In regular, TANFB storages the aggregated traffic 
data every 5-minute.

3.3 Incident data 
The incident data are supplied form Police Radio Station and updated every 180sec. 
Each incident is shown repeatedly in the database until it is cleared away from the 
traffic lane occupied. Table 3-4 shows the incident data in original form. The time, the 
incident type and incident location are recorded. The duration time of each incident

4.2 Model B: Sequential update of accident duration forecasting model 
After building the accident duration forecasting model for accident notification, 
sequential update of accident duration forecasting model is conducted for mirroring 
the variation of the traffic situation during accident existence. The aim of this model is 
to provide an updated forecast which considers the change of traffic situation till the 
accident cleared and traffic recovery. When an accident occurs, Model B takes over 
Model A to perform forecasts with updated data. In model training, the variation of 
traffic situation is included. 
 
The accident may cause fatality, injury and property damage. It is needed to pay 
more attention to reduce the inference from accident. We expect to quantify the 
influence of accidents and to provide the real-time forecasted accident duration by the 
models. 
 
4.3 Model structure 
The model process of data fusion for accident duration forecasting is shown in Figure 
4-2. This study considers the process of data fusion as a framework to conduct the 
accident duration forecasting model step by step. The processes include data 
collection, data filtering, data alignment and identity fusion.

4.4 Model inputs 
Accident data is updated every 180sec in the incident database (from Police Radio 
Station), while the VD data (from Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau) are 
recorded and accumulated every 300sec for each lane. The time-space relationship 
between the accident and the VD data is shown in Figure 4-4. In this figure, the 
accident occurs in Link 2 at 8:13 A.M. The figure further indicates that several gaps 
exist between the accident and the VD data. These gaps mean that differences will be 
existed between the scenario of data collection and the scenario of prediction, so that, 
the gaps must be considered when using the VD data to describe the traffic situation 
during the accident. For the model development, VD data from neighboring links are 
considered to present the time-space relation for accident existence. In order to 
recognize the change of traffic situation between the time when traffic data were last

Accident characteristics 
In our previous study [Wei & Lee, 2005], the significant factors to the accident 
duration are discussed by the factor sensitivity analysis. The factors, time of day, 
number of vehicles and vehicle type involved in accident and geometry, have high 
significance in conducting the duration model. In this way, the variables adopted in 
this study are based on our previous research. Accident characteristics include 
occupied lane, number of vehicles, and vehicle type involved in an accident.  
 
When the accident is reported, lane occupied by accident is one of the important 
features which are easy to be describe. Figure 4-5 shows five conditions of the 
occupied lanes. When only the inner lane or outer lane be occupied in accident, the 
mean of duration are very close to each other. We merge two conditions into one and 
consider one lane be occupied. Based on the same reason, the conditions that inner 
and outer lane be occupied and outer lane and shoulder be occupied are merged and 
 36 
Traffic data 
Based on accident location, traffic data collected by the first and the second VD at 
upstream and the first VD at downstream are used to present the traffic situation in the 
front and back of an accident. According to the spacing between the neighboring VDs 
in Taiwan, considering two upstream VDs can mostly cover the roadway affected by 
an accident. Model B is formulated to update the forecasted duration. Therefore, at 
every forecast, Model B considers real-time traffic data for the latest traffic situation 
during an accident. The input variables in Model B reflect a contrast between the 
traffic data before the accident has occurred and the real-time traffic data after the 
accident. 
 
Temporal relationship 
Figure 4-7 shows the relationship between the accident duration and time of day. The 
time of accident notification is related to the difference of accident duration between 
the daytime from 7:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and the nighttime from 6:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 
The VD data are accumulated and recorded every 300sec for each lane. There 
probably exists a time lag between the time of an accident notification and the 
recording time of VD data. The time lag is considered as an input to represent the 
possible variation of traffic situation between the time of accident notification and the 
recording time of VD data.

4.5.2 Cluster 
Cluster analysis is a set of methodologies for automatic classification of samples into 
a number of groups using a measure of association, so that the samples in one group 
are similar and samples belonging to different groups are not similar [Sharma, 1996]. 
The distance between the two instances is used as a measure of similarity. 
 
K-mean clustering method is adopted in this study. The procedure of the cluster 
analysis to reduce the data feature is as follows. 
 
Step 1: Select k initial cluster centroids or seeds, where k is the number of clusters 
desired. 
 
Step 2: Assign each observation to the cluster to which it is the closest. 
 
Step 3: Reassign or reallocate each observation to one of the k clusters according 
to a predetermined stopping rule.

Through the cluster analysis, the samples can be grouped as six clusters and a 
large number of VD data features can be replaced by one feature, namely traffic 
scenario. According to the feature, traffic scenario, the discrimination function can be 
found by discrimination analysis. Through the discrimination function, the real-time 
VD data can be discriminated as the one of the traffic scenarios. 
 
4.5.3 Selection 
The selected features can be considered as a subset among all possible sets in feature 
selection. In Model A, number of features from VD data is 48, the possible feature 
subsets are 248. In Model B, number of features from VD data is 96, the possible 
feature subsets are 296. Number of subsets is too huge to find the optimal subset by 
checking all subsets. The genetic algorithm (GA) is a good search engine and can be 
employed to search the almost optimal subset. 
 
The 96-length binary strings for N individuals are generated to build up the 
initial population. Each string represents a feature subset (coding of the feature subset) 
and the values at each position in the string are codes as either presence or absence of 
a particular feature. Then, the fitness is calculated for each feature subset. The fitness 
is an index to present how well a feature subset survives over the specified evaluation 
criteria. Better feature subsets have a greater chance of being selected to form a new 
 52 
Through the regression function, the estimated duration of each sample can be 
computed.

x : The independent variables 
 
The absolute error between the estimated accident duration and the actual 
accident duration is smaller, the regression function of feature subset is better. To 
evaluate the performance of chromosome, the fitness function is to sum up the 
absolute error of all samples.

Step 4: Generation of the offspring 
According to the fitness value of each chromosome, we use roulette wheel method to 
generate the offspring. 
 
Step 5: Alteration 
The alteration includes the crossover and mutation. According to the crossover rate, 
two chromosomes will be selected for one-position crossover. Comparing the fitness 
values between the offspring before and after crossover, the better chromosomes will 
be kept. According to the mutation rate, one chromosome will be chosen to change a 
gene value (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1). The mutation gives a chance to avoid 
 54 
Model B 
In order to select the best feature subset by GA, the following setups of GA are used.  
- The number of process variables (The number of genes): 96 
- Population size (The number of chromosome): 200 
- Crossover rate: 0.8 
- Mutation rate: 0.5 
- Stopping criterion: 100000 generations 
 
The selected variables in the best feature subset are shown in Table 4-5. Through the GA, 59 variables are selected from original 96 
variables. The selected variables mostly relate to the heavy vehicles (Bus or Trailer) and speed. In terms of the selected variables, heavy vehicle, 
speed variables and the traffic condition after accident notification have high influence on the accident duration.

4-8, where the output “y” is the estimated accident duration. Since a discrepancy 
might occur between the estimated output and the actual accident duration, the 
weights are adjusted repeatedly by a suitable training method until the resulting error 
is stabilized and negligible. The accident duration function inside the ANN model is 
formed after this training procedure is completed [Zurada, 1992].

The ANN algorithm was coded in MATLAB and run on a Pentium-M desktop 
computer. There are 120, 60 and 1 nodes in the input, hidden and output layers, 
respectively. The conventional method (i.e., the average value of the numbers of input 
and output nodes) was selected to determine the number of hidden nodes. The data 
were scaled between [-1, 1]. The sigmoid method was chosen as the transfer function. 
Figure 4-19 shows the plots for training performance and epochs. In model training, 
the train-error slightly decreases from 10-2 in 300 epochs to 10-3 in 1000 epochs. The 
performance improvement from 300 epochs to 1000 epochs is less than 0.09. 
Therefore, the difference of training performance is not significant between 300 
epochs and 1000 epochs. The epoch was set as 300 for training in this study. Training 
time is generally less than 17 sec.

accidents for model testing. In this section, the model performance is compared by 
plots, MAE, R2 and MAPE.

Figure 4-20, the plot, shows the relationship between the forecasted duration and the 
actual duration with four feature reductions. The plot configuration shows a linear 
relationship on the diagonal vector, indicating that most differences between the 
forecasted duration and the actual duration are stable within 1200 seconds.

road clearance and traffic recovery. With time past, the forecasted accident duration 
get closer to the actual duration. This result shows the sequential update of accident 
duration model can revise the prediction according to the real-time traffic data.

Table 4-9 shows the performance of Model B by MAE, R2, MAPE and 
computing time. In this study, Model B provides a sequential forecast for accident 
duration. In contrast to sequential forecasting, non-sequential forecasting provides the 
forecasted duration of each time point by subtracting the past time from the forecasted 
duration of Model A. The definition of past time is the time from accident notification 
to the time point of forecast. In terms of the MAE and R2, GA feature selection 
represents the best performance among three feature reductions. MAPE value of GA 
feature selection is around 28% as good as Composition method. This comparison 
results not only indicate that sequential forecasting concept has been effectively 
applied to the accident duration forecasting task, but also show that GA feature 
selection is a good method to reduce the noise for modeling.

5. Travel time Models 
For travel time models, first is the introduction of link travel time model in Section 
5-1. Section 5-2 shows the data process of travel time forecasting model. The detail of 
model inputs and data alignment is described in Section 5.3. The suitable variables for 
model training and testing will be determined. The identity fusion is shown in Section 
5.4. Section 5.5 evaluates the model forecasting effect for link, for path, with all data 
or without accident data. Section 5.6 summarizes the study achievements of accident 
duration forecasting model. 
 
5.1 Model C: Highway travel time forecasting model 
Highway travel time forecasting model is building a relation function between the 
traffic data as the model inputs and the travel time as the output variable. The traffic 
data includes the real time data form bus global position systems (GPS), vehicle 
detectors (VD), and incident databases. 
 
Before discussing the model development, we define the Link, the Section and 
the Path respectively and explain the relation among them. The Link is defined as the 
highway section between two neighboring interchanges. Each Link is connected to 
another. The Section refers the highway section between two particular interchanges 
according to the modeling request. Thus, a Section may cover several Links or be 
equal to a Link. Each Section is connected to another. As for the Path, we define it as 
an O-D pair between any two interchanges. The Path can be formed by linking 
consecutive Links. Each Path is independent of any others. 
 
If we were to build a travel time forecasting model for each O-D path, we would 
develop and maintain a large number of models. Although path-based travel time 
yields good accuracy, having too many models in a travel time information system 
rapidly becomes too complex to handle. Moreover, a path-based model is insensitive 
in reflecting the effect of irregular incidents in practice [Chen & Chien, 2001]. For 
developing a model more closely mirroring real traffic situations, partitioning the 
freeway into sections for modeling is considered a proper approach. Once a section 
travel time forecasting model has been built, the forecasted path travel time can be 
obtained by summing the forecasted section travel time. 
 
5.2 Model structure 
The flowchart of travel time model is shown in Figure 5-1. The data sources are most 
from GPS, VD, incident database and the forecasted accident duration.

5.3 Model inputs 
To qualify these data for data fusion, the base time is set when the designate bus 
passes through an interchange point. Figure 5-3 depicts the concept. If a bus passes 
through Interchange 2 at 8:13 A.M., the GPS data (bus running speed) are available at 
the same time. The existing accidents and duration of each accident are taken until 
8:13 A.M. Before the elapsed time, the latest VD data as the model inputs are updated 
at 8:10 A.M. To consider the space relation in the model, the data from the 
immediately neighboring links are also considered. The accident data for the entering 
link, previous link and next link are all used. The VD data are adopted from the 
previous and next links. The blocks marked with asterisks are the data selected for 
model development.

time in the daytime (6:00 a.m. ~ 8:00 p.m.) represents large variation between 300 sec 
and 1000 sec. According to the difference of travel time, the time of day is divided 
into four parts, 6:00 a.m. ~ 10:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. ~ 4:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m. ~ 8:00 p.m.

The traffic data from VD are recorded and accumulated every 300sec. Figure 5-7 and

point before buses pass through the interchange at Time T. The recoded time of VD 
data are closer to the passing time of bus, the VD data are more correlate with the

Under real traffic conditions, the stream may not propagate as suggested above. 
The speed of each vehicle will vary depending on individual drivers and traffic 
situations. The traffic data in a link may not be the same between Time T and Time 
T+5. As shown in Figure 5-10, representing one time interval later, traffic data Ta’ 
become lower than Ta, and Tc’ higher than Tc. The data Ta’ and Tc’ show the actual 
traffic situation, but cannot be effectively recorded by VD. Assessing the traffic data 
one time interval earlier results in a gap between the model inputs and actual traffic 
conditions. The adjacent links ought to be examined into model inputs at the same 
time. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been chosen as the key 
technique to explore the relation between the gap and travel time. The traffic variation 
is handled effectively in the ANN structure. The results are displayed in the next link.

Through the cluster analysis, the samples can be grouped as six clusters and a 
large number of VD data features can be replaced by one feature, namely traffic 
scenario. According to the feature, traffic scenario, the discriminant function can be 
found by discriminant analysis. Through the discriminant function, the real-time VD 
data can be discriminated as the one of the traffic scenarios. 
 
5.4.3 Feature selection 
The way to select the best feature subset is the same with the way used in accident 
duration model. 
 
The selected features can be considered as a subset among all possible sets in 
feature selection. In Model C, number of features from VD data is 64, the possible 
feature subsets are 264. Number of subsets is too huge to find the optimal subset by

5.5 Identity fusion 
In identity fusion, ANNs are the key technique. The ANNs approach is a data-driven, 
self-adaptive, and nonlinear methodology. After model training, the mapping between 
variables and travel time is formed. Then by inputting the data from tested examples 
into this trained model, the forecasted travel time is produced. Figure 5-11 is the 
schematic representation of an ANN network.

Figure 5-11. The model network in identity fusion 
 
When inputting variables into the network, the weights from input layer to 
hidden layer are calculated. Through the transfer function in the hidden layer, the 
input data are rescaled as inputs to the output layer. This process is shown in Equation 
5-4, where the output “y” is the estimated travel time. Since a discrepancy might 
occur between the estimated output and the actual travel time, the weights are 
adjusted repeatedly by a suitable training method until the resulting error is stabilized 
and negligible. The travel time function inside the ANN model is formed after this 
training procedure is completed (Zurada, 1992).

Figure 5-12. Plot for training performance and epochs 
 
After model training, the mapping between variables and travel time is formed. 
The forecasted travel time can be produced by inputting the data from the tested 
examples into this trained model. The plots, mean absolute error (MAE), R2 and mean 
absolute percentage error (MAPE) have been chosen for model evaluation. 
 
The plots are used to show the relationship between the forecasted travel time 
and the actual travel time. Actual travel time obtains from the bus which installs GPS 
and the bus travel time can be computed with the passing time at two interchanges. 
When the plot configuration shows linear relationship on the diagonal vector, this 
result indicates that most differences between the forecasted travel time and the actual 
travel time are small. 
 
The MAE has been chosen for each test example to present the difference 
between actual and forecasted travel time, as shown in equation 5-5. MAE value is 
smaller, and the forecasted travel time is closer to the actual travel time.

values, accident duration and accident characteristic are the important factors in 
estimating travel time. By incorporating the accident data into the model, the 
influence of specific accidents on travel time can be considered more directly. Only

6. Model validation 
The model validation includes validating the accident duration forecast and travel 
time forecast. Time period is 24 hours a day from August 12, 2005 to August 14, 
2005. 
 
6.1 Forecasted accident duration 
There are four accidents during these three days, as shown in Table 6-1. These 
accidents occur in different location and time of day. Figure 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 
show the validation results of forecasted accident duration. The forecasted accident 
duration decrease gradually with time past. These four figures display reasonable 
prediction results from accident notification to accident road clearance during traffic 
recovery. The first forecasted accident duration in each accident is a preliminary 
forecast by Model A and only uses the traffic data before the accident notification. 
After second prediction, Model B considers the real-time traffic data to adjust the 
forecasted results every five minutes. Therefore, the first forecast results do not near 
to the trend composed by other forecasts. In terms of this result, the real-time traffic 
data after accident notification is the important factor for providing the accurately 
forecasted accident duration.

6.2 Forecasted travel time 
Travel time model validation use the updated traffic data to provide forecasted travel 
time every 300sec (5 minutes) in 6 O-D pairs between An-ding and Lu-jhu 
intersection. Figure 6-5, 6-6, 6-7, 6-8, 6-9 and 6-10 show the forecasted travel time 
during August 12, 13 and 14, 2005. The forecasted travel time during a.m.8:00 ~ p.m. 
8:00 is longer than the forecasted travel time during p.m. 8:00 ~ a.m. 8:00. In the 
figures, the outliers are the prediction results affected by the accident.  
 
Accident 1 is notified at a.m. 7:56 in August 12 between An-ding and Yong-kang 
intersection. Due to the accident influence, the forecasted travel time during the 
accident duration from An-ding to Yong-kang, from An-ding to Tai-nan and from 
An-ding to Lu-jhu are longer than the forecasted travel time at usual. In the same day, 
Accident 2 occurs at 22:05 between Yong-kang and Tai-nan and increase the 
forecasted travel time of every path during 22:00 ~ 23:00. Between Tai-nan and 
Lu-jhu, Accident 3 occurs in the morning August 13. Every forecasted path travel 
time which pass through Tai-nan to Lu-jhu are affected during a.m. 8:00 ~ a.m. 9:00. 
 
When the accident duration decrease gradually, the longer forecasted travel time 
which affect by the accident are recover little by little to the normal range. Therefore, 
the predictions of this study really consider and reflect the accident influence. In terms 
of the plots in these six figures, Model C can provide the reasonable forecasted travel 
time with different traffic condition and time variation.

In order to clearly show the forecasting effect, the display unit of forecasted 
information is second in this study. However, the second of display unit is too detailed 
for traveler. Referring to travel time information systems in the world, the 
recommendation display unit is minute or five-minute.

input variables. Selection method utilizes the competition characteristic of genetic 
algorithm to choose the best subset of input variable and leave out the worthless 
variables. In terms of the model performance, feature reduction can decrease the 
number of model inputs and preserve the relevant traffic characteristics with a few 
inputs.  
 
7.2 Issues for future research 
There are still some following issues which are worth of further investigation. 
 
The accident duration forecasting model in this study only considers the accident 
data which significant affect the normal traffic flow. Future research could develop 
the incident duration forecast model which considers the other types of incident, such 
as barrier. The incident which does not involve the vehicle in is barrier. Something 
drops on the road or animal walks on the road are belongs to barrier. 
 
In this research, the travel time used in model building and evaluation is 
collected from the on-board GPS installed on the bus. Future research can use two 
methods to extend this research results for the car user. One is use the similar 
procedure of this study to build another travel time forecasting model which uses the 
data collected from car. The other is to build a relationship function between the bus 
travel time and car travel time. The forecasted car travel time can be provided by 
plugging in forecasted bus travel time into this relationship function whenever 
desirable. 
 
This study develops the link travel time model and combining the links model 
can fulfill the every possible O-D pairs. The future research can evaluate the forecast 
effect when applying this link model to the road network. The influence by system 
interchange will be an important factor when combining the forecasted travel time 
from different highway. 
 
For the surface street travel time forecasting, future research could apply the 
similar approaches and methods with this study and add other factors which 
interference the traffic flow of surface streets to develop the model.  
 
7.3 Study contribution 
 
1. A sequential accident duration forecast model has been developed. This model 
sequentially update the forecasted accident duration from accident notification to

不大，共收錄約 150篇文章。感覺主辦單位承辦經驗不足，在報到、接待、
報告安排等方面有待加強。

二、與會心得 
 
The 13th International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation 
Studies Transportation and Management Science雖然是香港地區交通運輸領
域一年一度的學術研討會，但其舉辦規模、與會先進、收錄研究皆十分的國
際化。所收錄的文章皆以英文撰寫，會議全程以英語進行，與會先進更是來
自世界各國知名大學講座與研究人員。除了相當具有國際觀之外，所收錄文
章的品質亦相當優質。相當佩服香港運輸學會能夠將本為區域性的學術活動
提升至國際性的層級，值得台灣借鏡與參考。 
參與此次會議能夠獲得其他國外學者對於本研究的寶貴意見與精闢的
見解，實為此行最大之收穫，有助於後續研究的精進。 
 
 
 
二、與會心得 
 
International Conference on Information Fusion為 IEEE成員內的研討會
之一，一年舉辦一次，至今已舉辦 12 屆。此會議舉辦地點的規劃，一年在
美國本土舉辦，下一年在美國以外的城市舉辦，之後再回到美國舉辦，如此
交替。第一次參加此一領域之研討會，發現全球專注在 Information Fusion
領域的專家不少，大多專注在資料、資訊的處理細節。共收錄約 250篇文章。
來參加本次研討後才發現此一研討會僅接受 5 篇智慧型運輸(Intelligent 
Transportation)相關的文章，本次投稿有幸能受大會青睞而收錄，甚感榮幸。

二、與會心得 
 
Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies為東亞地區運輸領域的重
要會議，兩年舉辦一次，三日的會議中吸收了來自世界各地的最新研究成
果，感佩日本學者的研究態度，可以聚焦在一單純的交通問題上，透過長時
間的資料收集與分析，尋找到解決問題的答案。 
大會另於會議最後一日安排技術參訪，參觀規模最大之城際巴士場站、
跨海大橋、搭乘專屬的通勤火車、郵輪，看見了印尼在交通上的投資與建設。 
參與此次會議能夠獲得其他國外學者對於本研究的寶貴意見與精闢的
見解，實為此行最大之收穫，有助於後續研究的精進。
