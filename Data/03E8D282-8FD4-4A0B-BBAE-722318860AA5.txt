Abstract 
 
 The facility location problem is 
concerned with the finding of the optimal 
location in a network for setting up a new 
service facility. We have studied location 
problems for about eight years and have 
proposed the best sequential and parallel 
algorithms for many of them. Very 
recently, a lot of researchers have turned 
their attention to a new kind of location 
problems, called the minmax regret 
location problems. The goal of this project 
is to continue our research experience to 
study the minmax regret location 
problems. Several related location 
problems are also studied in this project. 
 
Keywords: algorithms, parallel algorithms, 
location theory, optimization

E). We have the following improved 
result. 
 
Theorem A2. The minmax regret 1-median 
problem on a tree can be solved in O(n log n) 
time. 
 
B. The minmax regret 1-center problem 
 
For any scenario S ∈ Σ, and a point x 
∈ G, we define 
 
F(S, x) = maxv∈V ( × d(v, x)), Svw
 
which is the maximum weighted distance 
from any vertex to x according to S. Given 
a specific scenario S ∈ Σ, the classical 
1-center problem is to find a point x* ∈ G 
that minimizes F(S, x*). The point x* is 
called a 1-center of G under the scenario S. 
For any point x ∈ G, the regret of x with 
respect to a scenario S ∈ Σ is maxy∈G {F(S, 
x) – F(S, y)} and the maximum regret of x 
is 
 
Z(x) = maxS∈Σ maxy∈G {F(S, x) – F(S, y)}. 
 
The minmax regret 1-center problem is to 
find a point x ∈ G that minimizes Z(x). 
 
 Averbakh and Berman [2] had an 
O(mn2 log n)-time algorithm for finding a 
minmax regret 1-center of a graph G = (V, 
E). We have the following improved 
result. 
 
Theorem B1. The minmax regret 1-center 
problem on a general graph can be solved 
in O(mn log n) time. 
 
 On a tree T = (V, E), Averbakh and 
Berman [2] had an O(n2)-time algorithm 
for the minmax regret 1-center problem. 
We have the following improved result. 
 
Theorem B2. The minmax regret 1-center 
problem on a tree can be solved in O(n 
log2 n) time. 
 
C. Two generalized 2-median problems 
 
 The p-median problem on a tree T is to 
find a set S of p vertices on T that minimizes 
the sum of distances from T’s vertices to S. 
In this project, we study two generalizations 
of the 2-median problem, which are 
obtained by imposing constraints on the two 
vertices selected as a 2-median: one is to 
limit their distance while the other is to limit 
their eccentricity. Previously, both the best 
upper bounds of these two generalizations 
were O(n2) [13, 14]. Our results are as 
follows. 
 
Theorem C1 The generalized 2-median 
problem with distance constraint can be 
solved in O(nlog n) time. 
 
Theorem C2 The generalized 2-median 
problem with eccentricity constraint can be 
solved in O(nlog n) time. 
 
Theorem C3 The generalized 2-median 
problem with eccentricity constraint can be 
solved in O(nlog k) time when edge lengths 
are at most k = nO(1). In particular, it takes 
linear time for constant k. 
 
Theorem C4 The generalized 2-median 
problem with eccentricity constraint can be 
solved in linear time when vertex weights 
are polynomially bounded integers. 
 
D. The group median problem 
 
 Given a tree T = (V, E) and a vertex 
partition {S1, S2, ..., Sk} of V, the group 
median problem is to find a point g on T 
that minimizes ∑1≤i≤k max{d(v, g)| v ∈ Si}. 
In [8], Gupta and Punnen presented an 
O(nk)-time algorithm for the group 
median problem. Their algorithm requires 
O(n2) time when k = n. 
 Our result is as follows.
