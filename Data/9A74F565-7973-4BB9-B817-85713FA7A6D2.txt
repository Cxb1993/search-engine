(一) 前言： 
    本計畫主要研究一新型雙向直流-直流電源轉換器，以下將對研究的目的和文獻探討、研究方法、
研究結果、及討論詳加敘述。 
(二) 研究目的和文獻探討： 
雙向直流-直流電源轉換器使用於兩直流電源間做雙向能量傳送，可應用於電動車混合供電系統 
[1]-[3]、不斷電系統 [4], [5]、綠色能源與電池混合電力系統 [6]-[10]、及電池儲能/釋能系統 [11]-[13]. 
目前應用於雙向直流-直流轉換器之架構，如雙向直流-直流返馳式轉換器有架構簡單及容易控制之優點 
[2], [14], [15]。然而，由於變壓器漏電感能量的影響，導致功率切換開關遭受高電壓應力。因此為了回
收變壓器漏電感的能量及降低功率切換開關應力，一些文獻提出能量再生技術，回收變壓器漏電感的
能量及降低功率切換開關應力 [16]-[17]。另有部分文獻提出隔離型雙向直流-直流電源轉換器，包含半
橋型 [7], [8], [18], [19]、全橋型 [11], [20]，這些電源轉換器可調整變壓器的匝數比以達到高升壓比及
高降壓比之雙向功能。在非隔離型雙向直流-直流電源轉換器方面之研究，包含傳統的升壓/降壓型 [1], 
[4], [10], [12]，Sepic/Zeta 型 [21]，切換電容型 [22]，及耦合電感型 [23]。Sepic/Zeta 型由於是兩個電
力級所組成，因此其轉換效率較低。切換電容型及耦合電感型雖然可達到高升壓及高降壓的電壓增益
功能，但是其架構較為複雜，成本高。而傳統雙向升壓/降壓型如圖 1 所示，其優點為架構簡單、控制
容易，然而卻無法達到寬廣的升壓比及降壓比之功能。 
圖 2 為本計畫研製之新型雙向直流-直流電源轉換器。此轉換器採用的耦合電感之一次側及二次側
繞組為相同匝數。比較此轉換器及傳統升壓/降壓型轉換器，此轉換器有下列之優點： 
(1) 升壓模式時，具有較高的電壓增益。 
(2) 降壓模式時，具有較低的電壓增益。 
(3) 相同的電氣規格之下，流經新型轉換器切換開關之平均電流較傳統雙向升壓/降壓型轉換器為低。
可減少切換開關之導通損失，提高轉換效率。 
(4) 架構簡單、成本低。

Abstract – A single-phase isolated AC-DC converter is presented in 
this paper. The front semi-stage, which is a modified buck-boost 
converter, is used for power factor correction and is operated in 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to achieve high power 
factor and low total harmonic distortion of input current. The rear 
semi-stage, which is a forward converter, is operated in DCM for 
step-down voltage conversion. The proposed converter is suitable 
for universal input voltage (90~264 Vrms) and wide output-power 
range. This converter has the merits of low voltage stress on the 
DC-link capacitor and electrical isolation. Also, the operating 
principle and steady-state analysis is discussed. Finally, a 
prototype circuit is implemented to verify the feasibility of the 
proposed converter. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Traditionally, the diode bridge rectifier is used for AC-DC 
power conversion. It possesses the advantage of simple 
structure and low cost. However, this rectifier has some 
drawbacks, such as pulsating input current, high total harmonic 
distortion of input current (THDi), and low power factor. In 
order to improve these problems, many power factor correction 
circuits are presented. The two-stage converters can achieve 
high power factor, low voltage stress on the DC-link capacitor, 
and regulated output voltage. However, it has the disadvantages 
of control complexity and high cost. The AC-DC buck 
converters are utilized for power factor correction [1], [2]. 
Nevertheless, the power factor is low and the THDi is rather 
high. Some single-stage PFC converters, including CUK type, 
SEPIC type, boost-forward type, boost-flyback type, are 
developed [3]-[7]. Since the DC-link voltage varies with the 
variation of the input voltage and the load, the DC-link 
capacitor must bear high voltage stress for universal input 
voltage (90~264 Vrms). In order to reduce high voltage stress on 
the DC-link capacitor, some topologies are presented [8]-[9]. 
However, it causes poor THDi. A buck-boost converter 
integrated with a flyback converter is researched to achieve 
high power factor and low THDi [10]. However, it is not 
suitable for universal input voltage and wide output-power 
range. This paper researches a single-phase isolated AC-DC 
converter, which integrates a modified AC-DC buck-boost 
converter with a DC-DC forward converter. The proposed 
converter has the merits, such as high power factor, low THDi, 
low DC-link voltage. 
II. OPERATING PRINCIPLE OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER 
Fig. 1 shows the proposed converter, which integrates a 
modified AC-DC converter in the front semi-stage with a DC-
DC forward converter in the rear semi-stage. The two semi-
stage are both operated in discontinuous conduction mode 
(DCM) with a fixed duty ratio by using a simple pulse-width 
modulation controller. Switches, S1 and S2, are triggered using 
same control signal. A coupled inductor with same winding 
turns in the primary and secondary sides is employed in the 
proposed converter. The primary and secondary windings of the 
coupled inductor are charged in series from the line source 
during the switch-on period and are discharged in parallel 
during the switch-off period. The discharged time will be 
shortened. Namely, the duty ratio can be extended. Thus, the 
front semi-stage of the proposed converter can be operated with 
larger duty-ratio range than the conventional buck-boost 
converter with DCM operation. Therefore, the proposed 
converter can be applied for universal input voltage and wide 
output-power range. Fig. 2 shows some typical waveforms in a 
half line source period. Due to the symmetrical characteristics 
of the single-phase system, the following operating principle is 
analyzed for 0 < ωt < π, where ω is the line angular frequency. 
(I) Mode 1: The current-flow path is shown in Fig. 3(a). When 
the switches, S1 and S2, are turned on during time interval 
[hTs, th1], the primary and secondary windings of the 
coupled inductor are charged by series from line source and 
the energy stored in the DC-link capacitor C1 is discharged 
to output inductor Lo, output capacitor Co, and the load via 
the transformer Tr. 
(II) Mode 2: The current-flow path is shown in Fig. 3(b). While 
the switches, S1 and S2, are turned off during time interval 
[th1, th2], the primary and secondary windings of the coupled 
inductor release their energies by parallel to the DC-link 
capacitor C1 and the energy stored in output inductor Lo is 
released to output capacitor Co and the load. 
(III) Mode 3: The current-flow path is shown in Fig. 3(c). 
While the switches, S1 and S2, are still turned off during 
time interval [th2, th3].  The coupled-inductor currents, iL1 
and iL2, are equal to zero at t = th2. The energy stored in

III. STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER 
Due to the symmetrical characteristics of the single-phase 
system, the following analysis is discussed for 0 < ωt < π. For 
simplicity, the effect of the input filter is neglected. The line 
voltage is given as 
( ) ( ) 2 sin sin ,s s rms me t v t V t V tω ω= = =                        (1) 
where Vrms and Vm are the root-mean-square value and the 
amplitude of the line voltage. Since the switching frequency fs 
(fs = 1/Ts) is much larger than the line frequency f1, the line 
voltage can be considered as a piecewise constant during each 
switching period. Assuming m is the switching number within 
the time interval [0, π/ω], thus m is equal to fs/2f1. The 
following analysis is considered during the switching period 
[hTs, (h+1)Ts], where h = 0, 1, ….., m-1. 
Since the primary and secondary winding turns of the 
coupled inductor is same, the inductance of the coupled 
inductor in the primary and secondary sides are expressed as 
1 2 .L L L= =                                                                (2) 
Thus, the mutual inductance M of the coupled inductor is given 
by 
1 2 ,M k L L kL= =                                                     (3) 
where k is the coupling coefficient of the coupled inductor. 
The voltages across the primary and secondary windings of the 
coupled inductor are as follows:

Abstract – The paper presents a single-stage three-phase AC-DC 
converter, which integrates a three-phase AC-DC boost converter 
with a high step-up DC-DC converter by using single switch. The 
front semi-stage of the proposed converter is operated in 
discontinuous conduction mode for power factor correction and 
the rear semi-stage is operated in continuous conduction mode. 
The output-capacitor stack and the coupled inductor are utilized 
to achieve high voltage gain. The voltage stress on the switch is less 
than the output voltage. The low rating-voltage and conduction-
resistance MOSFET can be selected to reduce the conduction 
losses. The leakage-inductor energy of the coupled inductor is 
recycled for increasing the conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the 
operating principle and steady-state analysis are described. Finally, 
a prototype hardware circuit is implemented to illustrate the 
performance of the proposed converter. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Traditionally, the diode-bridge rectifier is used for AC-DC 
voltage conversion. However, the rectifier suffers pulsating 
input current, high total harmonic distortion of input current 
(THDi), and low power factor. Many topologies, such as buck 
types [1-3], boost types [4-6], and buck-boost types [7], [8], 
have been presented to improve the above problems. The boost 
types are used for step-up voltage conversion. They can be 
operated in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or 
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). However, these 
converters can not provide high step-up voltage gain. Thus, 
these converters must cascade a DC-DC converter to achieve 
high step-up voltage gain. It results in complicated control and 
high cost. 
In this paper, a single-stage three-phase AC-DC converter 
is proposed, as shown in Fig. 1. This converter can achieve 
high power factor and high voltage gain. The front semi-stage 
of the proposed converter utilizes a three-phase AC-DC boost 
converter, which is operated in DCM. The rear semi-stage of 
the proposed converter is a high step-up DC-DC converter 
using the output-capacitor stack and the coupled inductor, 
which is operated in CCM. 
II. OPERATING PRINCIPLE OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER 
The simplified circuit model of the proposed converter is 
shown in Fig. 2. The coupled inductor is modeled as a 
magnetizing inductor Lm, primary leakage inductor Lk1, 
secondary leakage inductor Lk2, and an ideal transformer. In 
order to simplify the circuit analysis, some conditions are 
assumed as: 1) All components are ideal. ON-state resistance 
Rds(on) of the active switch, the forward voltage drop of the 
diodes, and the equivalent series resistance of the coupled 
inductor and output capacitors are neglected. 2) Output 
capacitors C1, C2, and C3 are enough large, and the voltages 
across these capacitors are considered to be constant during 
each switching period.

are stacked to supply their energies for the load. At t = tk5, the 
energies stored in Lb and Lc are empty. 
Mode 6, [tk5, (k+1)Ts]: The current-flow path is shown in Fig. 
5(f). S1 is still turned off. The energies stored in Lm and Lk2 are 
released to C3. Thus, currents iLm and iLk2 are decreased. 
Meanwhile, the energy stored in Lk2 is recycled to C3. 
Capacitors C1, C2, and C3 are stacked to supply their energies 
for the load.

III. STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED CONVERTER 
A. Front semi-stage of the proposed converter: 
Due to the symmetrical characteristics of the three-phase 
system, the following analysis is discussed during [0o, 30o]. For 
simplicity, the effect of input filter is neglected and it is 
assumed that the three input phase voltages are given as follows: 
535
B. Rear semi-stage of the proposed converter: 
To simplify the steady-state analysis, the leakage inductors 
of the coupled inductor are neglected. When S1 is turned on, the 
voltage across Lm is derived as 
(on) 1.Lm cv V=                                                                 (13)

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A prototype circuit is implemented in the laboratory to 
verify the feasibility of the proposed converter for a micro-scale 
wind-power generation system. The output voltage and 
frequency of the three-phase generator is the input voltage and 
frequency of the proposed converter. In the proposed converter, 
the electrical specifications and circuit-component parameters 
are selected as follows: input line voltage/frequency Vin/f1 = 20 
Vrms/15 Hz~80 Vrms/62 Hz, Vo = 400 V, Po(max.) = 600 W, fs = 50 
kHz, L = 34 μH, Lm = 205 μH, C1 = 820 μF, C2 = C3 = 220 μF, Lf 
= 2.4 mH, Cf = 2 μF, and n = 1. Switch S1 and diodes D1~D4 are 
chosen to be IXFK64N50P and DSEP30-06A, respectively. 
Figs. 6 and 7 show some experimental waveforms under 
full-load conditions, Vin/f1 = 80 Vrms/62 Hz and Po = 600 W, and 
light-load conditions, Vin/f1 = 20 Vrms/15 Hz and Po = 30 W. One 
can see from Figs. 6(a) and 7(a) that the input phase voltage and 
input phase current is in phase. Figs. 6(b) and 7(b) show the 
three-phase input currents. It is seen that the current stress is 
reduced for the generator winding. Three output-capacitor 
voltages are shown in Figs. 6(c) and 7(c). Fig. 8 shows the 
measured efficiency for various conditions. It can be seen that 
the maximum efficiency is 88% at Vin/f1 = 61 Vrms/46 Hz, Vo = 
400 V, and Po = 360 W.
