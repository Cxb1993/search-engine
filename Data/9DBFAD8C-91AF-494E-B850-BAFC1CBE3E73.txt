Thermal Stresses in a Viscoelastic Tri-Material With a 
Combination of a Point Heat Source and a Point Heat Sink 
 
 
 
Abstract 
 
A general solution for a thermoviscoelastic trimaterial combined with a point 
heat source and a point heat sink is presented in this work.  Based on the method of 
analytic continuation associated with the alternation technique, the solutions to the 
heat conduction and thermoelastic problems for three dissimilar, sandwiched media 
are derived.  A rapidly convergent series solution for both the temperature and stress 
field, expressed in terms of an explicit general term of the corresponding 
homogeneous potential, is obtained in an elegant form.  The hereditary integral in 
conjunction with the Kelvin-Maxwell model is applied to simulate the 
thermoviscoelastic properties, while a thermorheologically simple material is 
considered.  Based on the correspondence principle, the Laplace transformed 
thermoviscoelastic solution is directly determined from the corresponding 
thermoelastic one.  The real time solution can then be solved numerically by taking 
the inverse Laplace transform.  A typical example concerning the interfacial stresses 
generated from a combined arrangement of a heat source and sink are discussed in 
detail.  The corresponding thin film problem is also discussed.

and a prime notation indicates the derivative with respect to its argument.  k  and 
G  denote the heat conductivity and elastic shear modulus, respectively.  
Furthermore, the material constants κ  and β  are defined as 3 4κ ν= −  and 
(1 )β ν α= +  for plane strain, and (3 ) /(1 )κ ν ν= − +  and β α=  for plane stress, 
where ν  is Poisson’s ratio, and α  is the coefficient of thermal expansion.  The 
components of displacements and stresses can be expressed in terms of two complex 
stress functions, ( )zΦ  and ( )zΩ , associated with a temperature function, ( )zθ , 
when the thermal effect is considered. 
 
2. Temperature field of a trimaterial 
 
Referring to Fig. 1, consider a dissimilar triple-layer medium with two perfectly 
bonded interfaces L ( 2 0x = ) and *L ( 2x h= ).  Suppose that the regions 
aD ( 2x h> ), bD ( 2 0h x> > ), and cD ( 2 0x < ) are occupied by materials a , b , and 
c , respectively.   
For the first argument, we regard regions aD  and bD  to be composed of the 
same material b  and region cD  of material c .  If 0 ( )zθ  signifies a potential for 
a singularity in an infinite homogeneous plane of material b , then 1( )c zθ , (analytic 
in cD ) and 1( )zθ  (analytic in a bD D∪ ) are introduced to satisfy the continuity 
conditions across L  as

The continuity of temperature and total heat flux across the interface, L , requires 
 
0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ + 0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ = 1 1( )c xθ + 1 1( )c xθ  
bk [ 0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ ]- bk [ 0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ ]= ck 1 1( )c xθ - ck 1 1( )c xθ             (6) 
 
Through standard analytic continuation arguments it follows that 
 
1( )zθ + 0 ( )zθ = 1( )c zθ , a bz D D∈ ∪  
1( )zθ + 0 ( )zθ = 1( )c zθ , cz D∈                           (7) 
and 
bk 1( )zθ - bk 0 ( )zθ =- ck 1( )c zθ , a bz D D∈ ∪  
- bk 1( )zθ + bk 0 ( )zθ = ck 1( )c zθ , cz D∈                        (8) 
 
Uncoupling Eqs. (7) and (8), we obtain 
 
1( )zθ = cbΛ 0 ( )zθ , a bz D D∈ ∪  
1( )c zθ = cbΠ 0 ( )zθ , cz D∈                            (9) 
with 
For the third argument, we again assume aD  and bD  are made up of the same 
material b , and region cD  is composed of material c .  Additional terms, 2 ( )zθ  
(analytic in a bD D∪ ) and 2 ( )c zθ  (analytic in cD ) are introduced to satisfy the 
continuity conditions across the interface L .  By using a similar way to the previous 
approach, we can let

we have,

The material constants without mention here, except the symmetric terms, are 
assumed to be zero for an isotropic material.  Note that when 0tη η= =  of the 
material a ( aD ) or c ( cD ), it indicates that the material properties of the medium are 
independent of time, or that the medium is assumed to be elastic for the sake of 
simplicity.  In the following cases, let the point heat source be located at 
sz 1 2( ,  / 2)s sx h x h= − = , and the heat sink at kz 1 2( ,  / 2)k kx h x h= = . 
 
Specific Case 1 - When a ( aD ) and c ( cD ) are the Same Material 
Fig. 2 shows the interfacial stresses along 2( 0)L x =  at 0t = , with a cG G= , 
a ck k= , a cα α= , / 1.2c bG G = , / /c b c bk k G G= , and / /c b b cG Gα α = .  It indicates 
that the normal stress is skew-symmetric to the 2x -axis, which becomes positive at 
the heat sink side and negative at the heat source side.  The maximum value of the 
normal stress occurs at 1 / 1.2x h = ± .  Meanwhile, the shear stress is symmetric to 
the 2x -axis and is positive in the region between the heat source and sink.  It also 
shows that the maximum shear stress occurs at 1 / 0.6x h = ± .  Note that the positive 
or negative interfacial stresses depend on the choice of material properties for the 
trimaterial.  Fig. 3 shows the evolution of interfacial normal stresses at points 
1 /x h =0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 2( 0)x = , respectively.  It indicates the normal stresses 
decrease with time because of thermoviscoelastic effects of material b .  Besides, 
the normal stress vanishes at the point 1 /x h =0.  Fig. 4 shows the evolution of 
interfacial shear stresses at points 1 /x h =0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 2( 0)x = .  It indicates 
that the absolute value of the shear stress decreases with time. 
 
Specific Case 2 – The Thin-Film Problem 
The trimaterial problem can be reduced to a finite thickness film/substrate 
problem by letting the upper or lower medium vanish.  Fig. 5 shows the interfacial 
stresses of a film/substrate, assuming 0aG → , 0ak → , and / 1.2c bG G = , 
/ /c b c bk k G G= , / /c b b cG Gα α = .  It shows that the interfacial stresses for the 
film/substrate problem have the same tendency as those in the trimaterial problem 
(comparing to Fig. 2), except that the values of the film/substrate problem (Fig. 5) are 
larger.  This happens because the free surface of the finite thickness film/substrate 
( *L ) is insulated ( 0ak = ), leaving the heat to flow to the substrate, resulting in an 
increase of the temperature on the interface L .  Fig. 6 shows the evolution of 
interfacial stresses of a film/substrate at 1 /x h =0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.  It shows the 
normal stresses decreasing with time at the beginning, and then converging to 
constants after a period of time.  Fig. 7 shows the interfacial shear stresses of a 
film/substrate, which also indicates that the absolute values of the shear stresses

1.  Introduction 
  Composite cylinders are one of the most frequently used structures in engineering 
applications, which have the advantage of dissimilar materials and behave flexibility 
in design. However, thermal stresses induced by the thermal mis-match of dissimilar 
media become the main mechanism in multilayered media failure since temperature 
difference increases rapidly in many components recently. Moreover, with the 
advance in material science, many multilayered components are polymeric base 
which behave particularly sensitive to the temperature change. The stress analysis of 
the interaction between time and temperature in multilayered viscoelastic structures 
becomes an important topic in modern design. 
The analysis of multilayered problems is complicated since the solutions must be 
forced to satisfy the continuity conditions of multiple interfaces. Consequently, the 
conventional approach to stress analysis for multilayered media problems requires the 
need to solve a system of simultaneous equations with a large number of unknown 
constants [1] and [2]. Some more efficient methods dealing with the complicated 
continuity conditions have been proposed. Based on the transfer matrix approach, 
which is expressed in terms of the infinite series expansion allowing solutions with 
various orders of approximation to be obtained, the elasticity problem of a 
multilayered medium was solved by [3]. Based on the Fourier transform technique in 
association with the stiffness matrix approach, the solutions for multilayered 
anisotropic elastic media were obtained by [4] and [5].  The alternating technique to 
obtain solutions for singularity problems in an isotropic and anisotropic trimaterial 
was given by [6] and [7]. An analytic continuation associated with the alternating 
technique to solve the thermoelastic problem of an isotropic trimaterial was provided 
by [8]. 
direction, respectively, and k  stands for the heat conductivity. Once the temperature 
function ( )zθ  is solved, the components of the displacement and stresses can be 
determined according to the prescribed boundary conditions. For a two-dimensional 
theory of thermoelasticity, the components of the displacement and traction force can 
be expressed in terms of two stress functions and a temperature function as [16]

The analytic continuation associated with alternating technique is applied to obtain 
the thermal potential for a trimaterial subjected to a uniform heat flow as shown in Fig. 
1. First, we regard regions Da and Db composed of the same material b and region Dc 
of material c. If )(0 zθ  represents a thermal potential for a singularity in an infinite 
homogeneous plane, )(0 zcθ  holomorphic in Dc and )(1 zθ  holomorphic in a bD D∪

Consider an isotropic material, the relations between elastic compliances and modulus 
are 
with a cG G= , a ck k= , a cα α= , / 2c bG G = , / /c b c bk k G G= , and / /c b b cG Gα α = . 
It shows that the normal stress decreases as time increases because of 
thermoviscoelastic effects of material b . It also shows that the normal stress becomes 
negative at 0iz be=  and / 4ibe π , and positive at 3 / 4ibe π  and ibe π . This indicates 
that the compressive (or tensile) normal stress prevails at the site with high (or low) 
temperature. Moreover, it indicates that the normal stress is symmetric to the 1x -axis 
and skew-symmetric to the 2x -axis. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of interfacial shear 
stresses in a three-phase cylinder with a cG G= , a ck k= , a cα α= , / 2c bG G = , 
/ /c b c bk k G G= , and / /c b b cG Gα α = . It indicates the shear stresses decrease with 
time and converge to constant values as / 2t λ > . The shear stress becomes positive 
at / 2iz be π−=  and / 4ibe π−  and negative at z = / 4ibe π  and / 2ibe π . On the contrary, 
the shear stress is symmetric to the 2x -axis and skew-symmetric to the 1x -axis. 
A three-phase cylinder can be reduced to a two-phase hollow cylinder by letting 
the inner medium vanish. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that the evolution of interfacial 
normal and shear stresses in a two-phase hollow cylinder with / 2c bG G = , 
/ /c b c bk k G G= , / /c b b cG Gα α = , by assuming 0aG → , 0ak → . The results show 
that the interfacial stresses have the same tendency as those in a three-phase solid 
cylinder (comparing to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) except that the values of the hollow cylinder 
case (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) are larger. This happens because of an increase of the 
temperature on the interface L in the hollow cylinder. 
In general, it is difficult to obtain the real time solution from inverse Laplace 
transform. The inverse operation often leads into instable results. For a 
Kelvin-Maxwell three-parameter model, we only have a pole at 1/λ−  ( tλ λ= ) in 
this work. Therefore, we can use Eqs. (41) and (42) to find the numerical solution
