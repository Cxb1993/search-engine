the linear interval regression weights. Finally, the 
average behavior of the root mean squared error and 
the square of the correlation coefficient in the 
framework of a Monte Carlo experiment are used as 
the performance index.

四、研究背景與重要性 
In many real word applications, engineers are 
often asked to deal with symbolic interval-values 
data [1, 2]. An often-seen example is the 
measurements obtained by the same/similar 
measuring instruments. The measured value ix~  is 
uncertain because measurements are never 100% 
accurate. Another case is the privacy in statistical 
databases. When ix~  corresponds to data that we 
want to keep private, e.g., health parameters of 
different patients, we do not want statistical 
programs to have full access to the data because 
otherwise, by computing sufficiently many different 
statistics, it is possible to uniquely reconstruct the 
actual value. One way of preventing this from 
happening is to supply the statistical data processing 
programs not with the exact data, but only with 
intervals of possible values of these data. Such type 
of data have been mainly studied in symbolic data 
analysis (SDA), which is a domain in the area of 
knowledge discovery and data management related 
to multivariate analysis, pattern recognition and 
artificial intelligence. The aim of SDA is to provide 
suitable methods (clustering, factorial techniques, 
decision trees, etc.) for managing aggregated data 
described by multi-valued variables, for which the 
cells of the data table contain sets of categories, 
intervals or weight (probability) distributions [3-6].  
In the literature, some approaches have been 
introduced to analyze the symbolic interval-values 
data [7-14]. In this study, the regression models for 
the interval-values data are considered and discussed. 
For the linear regression models, some of 
approaches are proposed for predicting the symbolic 
interval-values data. In [15], the authors introduced 
the first approach to fitting a linear regression model 
to the symbolic interval data sets from an SDA 
perspective. Their approach consists of fitting a 
linear regression model for the mid-points of the 
interval values assumed by the symbolic interval 
variables in the training data set. They applies this 
model in using the lower and the upper bounds of 
the interval values of independent symbolic interval 
variables to predict the lower and the upper bounds 
of the interval value of a dependent variable, 
respectively. In [16], the Centre and Range (CR) 
method to fitting a linear regression model for the 
symbolic interval data is proposed.  
However, the linear regression models are only 
considered in the above analysis methods. The 
modified RBFNs is studied for the above problems 
in this project. In these structures, the concepts of 
RBFNs with regression weights are used [17-19]. 
Moreover, it has been shown that the size of the 
RBFNs with regression weights significantly 
reduced [19]. In the structures, the Gaussian 
functions and the synaptic weights in the traditional 
RBFNs are replaced by the Gaussian function with 
interval distance measure and the linear interval 
regression weights, respectively. Additionally, the 
concepts of the regression models for MinMax 
method and CR method in [16] are considered in the 
linear interval regression weights of the modified 
RBFNs structures. In the modified structures, two

In these structures (i.e. RBFNs-LU and RBFNs-CR), 
two stages in the learning process are considered. In 
stage 1, the initialization of the proposed structures 
is obtained by interval competitive agglomeration 
(ICA) clustering algorithm. In stage 2, a 
gradient-descent kind of learning algorithms is 
applied to fine-tuning the parameters of the 
proposed structures.

The learning algorithm of the RBFNs-LU and 
RBFNs-CR 
 
The initial structure of the RBFNs-LU and 
RBFNs-CR independently obtained by the ICA 
clustering algorithm is only a rough approximation 
to the desired model due to no fine-tuning process in 
the algorithm. After obtaining an initial structure, 
they can then be adjusted by supervised learning 
algorithms to improve the modeling accuracy. This 
stage is referred to as the fine-tuning process. A cost 
function of the learning algorithm for the 
RBFNs-LU is defined as

ISVIRNs with maximum epsilon ( maxε ) is worse 
than proposed methods. The number of hidden node 
for ISVIRNs with maxε  is less than ISVIRNs 
with minε . For Fun3, the learning process often 
divergence when ISVIRNs with maxε . Hence, 
LRMSE and URMSE can not calculated. It is note that 
the lower bound and upper bound of the 
interval-valued data is only considered. Although the 
performance index of ISVIRNs with minε  is slightly 
better than proposed methods, the number of hidden 
nodes is larger than the proposed methods. Moreover, 
the performance index of ISVIRNs with 
non-properly chosen ε  is worse. That is, the 
parameters in the ISVIRNs are hardly determined.

on the generating procedure of symbolic 
interval-values data, the number of symbolic

separated as 188 for the training data set and 12 for 
the testing data set. In the performance indices, an 
average and the standard deviation of the RMSE are

Abstract—In the literature, some of methods are proposed for 
the symbolic interval-values data. They have the Centre method 
(CM), the MinMax method and the Centre and Range (CR) 
method. For the above methods, they needs solve the inverse of 
matrix. However, the dimension of this matrix is increased as 
increasing the variables. Moreover, the condition number of this 
matrix is large, it may cause a large error of solution (i.e. ill-
conditioned). The above methods do not guarantee that the 
predicted values of the lower bounds will be lower than the 
predicted values of the upper bounds. To overcome the above 
problems, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is 
applied to estimate the parameters of linear regression models. 
From the simulation results, the proposed method can provide 
satisfactory results. 
Keywords—symbolic interval-values data, particle swarm 
optimization algorithm and linear regression models. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
In many real world applications, engineers are often asked 
to deal with symbolic interval-values data [1, 2]. An often-seen 
example is the measurements obtained by the same/similar 
measuring instruments. The measured value   is uncertain 
because measurements are never 100% accurate. Another case 
is the privacy in statistical databases. When   corresponds to 
data that we want to keep private, e.g., health parameters of 
different patients, we do not want statistical programs to have 
full access to the data because otherwise, by computing 
sufficiently many different statistics, it is possible to uniquely 
reconstruct the actual value. One way of preventing this from 
happening is to supply the statistical data processing programs 
not with the exact data, but only with intervals of possible 
values of these data. Such type of data have been mainly 
studied in symbolic data analysis (SDA), which is a domain in 
the area of knowledge discovery and data management related 
to multivariate analysis, pattern recognition and artificial 
intelligence. The aim of SDA is to provide suitable methods 
(clustering, factorial techniques, decision trees, etc.) for 
managing aggregated data described by multi-valued variables, 
for which the cells of the data table contain sets of categories, 
intervals or weight (probability) distributions [3-6].  
In the literature, some approaches have been introduced to 
analyze the symbolic interval-values data [7-14]. In this study, 
the regression models for the interval-values data are 
considered and discussed. For the linear regression models, 
some of approaches are proposed for predicting the symbolic 
interval-values data. In [15], the authors introduced the first 
approach to fitting a linear regression model to the symbolic 
interval data sets from an SDA perspective. Their approach 
consists of fitting a linear regression model for the mid-points 
of the interval values assumed by the symbolic interval 
variables in the training data set. They applies this model in 
using the lower and the upper bounds of the interval values of 
independent symbolic interval variables to predict the lower 
and the upper bounds, respectively, of the interval value of a 
dependent variable. In [16], the Centre and Range (CR) method 
to fitting a linear regression model for the symbolic interval 
data is proposed.  
However, the above methods must solve the inverse of 
matrix. The dimension of this matrix is increased as increasing 
the variables. Moreover, the condition number of this matrix is 
large, it may cause a large error of solution (i.e. ill-
conditioned). Additionally, the above methods do not guarantee 
that the predicted values of the lower bounds will be lower than 
the predicted values of the upper bounds [17]. Hence, the 
particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to estimate the 
parameters of linear regression models. In this study, the linear 
regression models those using the representation of the centre, 
the minimum/maximum and the centre/range are considered 
and estimated by the PSO algorithm. 
This study is organized as follows. After this introduction 
section, the linear regression models for symbolic interval-
values data is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the proposed 
methods are described. In Section 4, the simulations are 
conducted and the results verify the applicability of the 
proposed methods. Finally, Section 5 concludes this study.。

III. CONSTRUCTING THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS FOR 
THE SYMBOLIC INTERVAL-VALUES DATA USING PSO 
ALGORITHM 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an emerging 
population-based meta-heuristic that simulates social behavior 
such as birds flocking to a promising position to achieve 
precise objectives in a multidimensional space [18-20]. Like 
evolutionary algorithms, PSO performs searches using a 
population (called swarm) of individuals (called particles) that 
are updated from iteration to iteration. To discover the optimal 
solution, each particle changes its searching direction 
according to two factors, its own best previous experience 
(pbest) and the best experience of all other members (gbest). 
In [20], pbest and gbest are called as the cognition part and the 
social part, respectively. 
Each particle represents a candidate position (i.e., 
solution).A particle is considered as a point in a D-dimension 
space, and its status is characterized according to its position 
and velocity. The D-dimensional position for the particle i  at 
iteration t can be represented as { }1 2, ,...,t t t ti i i iDx x x x= . Likewise, 
the velocity (i.e., distance change), which is also an D-
dimension vector, for particle i at iteration t can be described 
as { }1 2, ,...,t t t ti i i iDv v v v= . Let { }1 2, ,...,t t t ti i i iDp p p p=  represent the best 
solution that particle i has obtained until iteration t, and 
{ }1 2, ,...,t t t tg g g gDp p p p=  denote the best solution obtained from tip  
in the population at iteration t. To search for the optimal 
solution, each particle changes its velocity according to the 
cognition and social parts as follows: 
 
1
1 1 1 1( ) ( )
1, 2,...,
t t t t t t
id id id id gd idv v c r p x c r p x
d D
−
= + − + −
=
         (10) 
 
where 1c indicates the cognition learning factor; 2c  indicates 
the social learning factor, and 1r  and 2r are random numbers 
uniformly distributed in U(0,1). Each particle then moves to a 
new potential solution based on the following equation: 
 
1   1, 2,...,t t tid id idx x v d D
+
= + =                (11) 
 
The summary of the PSO can be presented in five steps in this 
study 
Step 1: Randomly generate initial particles. 
Step 2: Measure the fitness of each particle in the population. 
In this study, the roots mean square error (RMSE) is 
used as the fitness function. 
Step 3: Compute the velocity of each particle with Eq. (10). 
Step 4: For each particle, move to the next position according 
to Eq. (11). 
Step 5: Stop the algorithm if termination criterion is satisfied; 
return to Step 2 otherwise. 
IV. SIMULATIONS 
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust 
approaches, examples with two cases of outliers in the 
symbolic interval-values data and one real data set are 
considered in this study. The performance measures are 
obtained from the observed values ],[ UiLii yyy =  and their 
corresponding predicted values ]ˆ,ˆ[ˆ UiLii yyy =  for i=1,2,…,n. 
Two performance indexes are used. One is the performance 
assessment of these regression method is defined as [21]

In this study, the generating method of the symbolic 
interval-values data is stated as follows. The simple linear 
regression model is considered as 
0.5 1.2y x= + , ]2,0[Ux ∈ ,             (14) 
where ]2,0[U  is represented as the uniformly distributed in the 
ICSSE 2011  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this study, PSO is successfully applied to obtain the 
parameters of linear regression models for the symbolic 
interval-values data. In simulation results, the proposed 
methods present a satisfactory performance in the simple 
linear functions and the school interval data set.

Eclipse[11][12] is famous for the free cross-platform 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Initially 
mainly used Java, but now some people make it through

make Eclipse a better flexibility.  
C. API 
Application Programming Interface (API)[13] is the 
software interface different components of the system 
agreement. In recent years an increasingly large scale of 
software will often need to divide complex systems into 
smaller components, the programming interface design 
is very important. The practice of programming, the 
programming interface software system designed to 
make the first reasonable division of responsibilities. 
Good interface design can reduce the interdependence of 
the various parts of the system to improve the 
composition of unit cohesion, reducing the coupling 
between the component units to improve system 
maintenance and expansion of functionality.  
D. SDK 
Software Development Kit(SDK)[14] generally are 
used by software engineers for specific software package, 
software framework, hardware platform, operating 
system, application software development tools to 
establish a collection. It may simply provide for a 
programming language application programming 
interface of some files, but may also include embedded 
systems with a complex communications hardware. 
General tool for debugging and other purposes, including 
utility. SDK also often include sample code, support for 
the technical notes or other reference materials for the 
basic support for the document to clarify the doubts. 
Software engineers often the subject of system 
developers from the get software development kits. To 
encourage developers to use their system or language, 
many of SDK is available free of charge.

 In many real world applications, engineers are often asked to deal with 
symbolic interval-values data, which may also contain outliers.
 The measured value is uncertain because measurements are never 100% 
accurate.

 Global Position System, also known as global positioning system, was 
originally the U.S. Department of Defense for military timing, positioning 
and navigation purposes of the development, is now open for civilian use, 
the combination of satellites and communications technology in the 
development of private market is booming, in addition to providing 
precise positioning, but also provide precise time, height and speed, this
shows the GPS in the future is full of business opportunities.

Conclusion
 Applications of this research are mainly the way through the WI-FI 
connection and transmission do, positioning using WI-FI in the base station. 
Using Google Maps to map displayed on the phone above and shown by 
the Zoom size map of the lens to adjust the distance, and size is transferred 
into a 17, the greater the value the more detailed map of the details. 
Although this study has reached a GPS function, but there are many in the 
design development and improvement. For example: Layers can be 
increased above the map, and then increase near the top of their wish to add 
a landmark, shops, etc., can be shared among friends.
