一、中文摘要
半導體製造業具有高成本、低生命週期的性
質，如何提升其產品良率、減少不良品的發生，
進而使得企業獲利提升，是一個相當重要的課
題。改善良率的方式，可藉由在生產的過程中
快速的找到發生問題之加工站，進而立即尋求
改善，但是經過冗長資訊的回饋再做改善過程
的同時，不良品已經產生；而且，在生產製造
上已花了許多的時間，不僅無法有效的因應產
品生命週期的變化，對於分秒必爭的資訊科技
時代，無形中形成了一個阻擋企業成長的阻
力。如果能夠在製程問題發生之初，也就是在
設計階段就先將可能發生影響問題的原因找出
再加以解決，那麼不僅可以節省許多不必要的
製程成本，更可以縮短產品上市的時間，進而
提升良率，降低成本，最終達成更具有競爭力
的產品。
近年來越來越多的半導體製程將良率改善的重
點放在如何提升化學機械研磨製程的良率，並
藉由在晶圓的電路設計階段時，即預先考量加
工時會產生的問題，來降低晶圓在這道製程中
因碟盤效應而產生的產品不良現象。碟盤效應
（Dish Effect）是晶圓在化學機械研磨加工過
程中所產生的一種製程不良的問題，其原因是
來自於晶圓電路佈置圖上的電路密度分佈不
均，導致研磨墊加諸在晶圓上的應力不均，而
產生的晶圓表面凹陷現象。為了解決此一問
題，一般多以虛擬電路填入(Dummy Filled)的
方式，以改善晶圓表面之平坦化。本研究之目
的即是希望能透過一個有效的運算方式，來找
出最適當的虛擬電路填充方法，使晶圓表面達
到最佳平坦化，以進一步改善晶圓在化學機械
研磨加工過程中所產生之碟盤效應問題，提升
其良率。
本研究考慮大型積體電路（VLSI）中電路資料
層級多、密集且複雜的特性，因此首先嘗試將
電路資料以群集化分析減少其複雜程度，將龐
大的電路資料依其性質群聚後，當電路群的電
路密度小於臨界值時，該群的電路密度較低，
代表著其所分佈的電路較稀疏，表面電路分佈
較不平坦，因此需藉由填入虛擬電路來改善其
平坦度；接著在第一年度計畫中運用數學規劃
分析方法，結合多目標的觀念以及晶圓電路設
計的佈置規則，發展雙目標非線性規劃的數學
模式，分析求解虛擬電路的填充數量，使能達
到晶圓表面電路分佈最平坦化的目的。在本年
度計畫中則修正原先之數學模型，使之更接近
業者之實際需求。此外，為了降低資料的複雜
度，本年計計畫中進行了兩階段資料群集分
析，以簡化龐大的資料分析過程，接著才在不
違反電路規則之下，使用數學規劃的方法求解
虛擬電路的填充問題。

Abstract
Semiconductor manufacturing industry has
the characteristics of high production c
osts and short life cycle of the product
s. It is therefore very important to red
uce the amount of defective products and
find the way to enhance the production y
ield rate in order to bring more profits
to the enterprises. To find the problems
on the work station and activate the imp
rovements immediately is one approach to
improve the yield during the manufacturi
ng process. But the defective products h
ave already been produced at the same ti
3in later processes. If we use shorter wavelength to
expose, the resolution of an optical system can be
improved. That is the reason why the wavelength
is shorter and shorter in the technique of
photolithography process. Another important
characteristic in optical system is Depth of Focus
(DOF). For a bigger depth of focus, it is easier to
focus on photoresist in the wafer surface.
Unfortunately, depth of focus and resolution
always conflict with each other. In order to
improve the resolution we need shorter
wavelength or bigger Numerical Aperture. The
Depth of Focus will therefore be decreased. To
avoid this situation that wavelength influences the
variation of depth of focus, it is necessary to
reduce the concave and convex degree in wafer
surface under different of depth of focus.
Therefore, the technique of eliminating caves in
wafer surface is important.
Dish effect is due to the fact that the pad
exerts different stresses upon the wafers. Because
the variability of the circuit density, it will
decrease the planarity of the wafer surface. Caves
and defects may therefore be formed after the
CMP process. To solve this problem, it is
necessary to insert dummy circuits into
low-density layout regions such that the variability
of the circuit density can be reduced, the dish
effect can hopefully be eliminated and yield can be
increased at the same time. How to find the
optimizing pattern density in the wafer and to
improve pattern density uniformity is an important
issue in the process of CMP.
The objective of dummy circuits is to make
pattern density more uniform across a die. This
research focuses on how to insert dummy circuits
in original circuit layout to increase the circuit
density, improve the planarity of the wafer surface,
and therefore improve the yield.
One of the objectives in this research is to
eliminate the dish effect which we have mentioned
above. Dish effect will decrease the planarity of
the wafer surface because of the variability of the
circuit density. Through an efficient algorithm, it
is possible to find out an appropriate method of
inserting dummy circuits. And it can improve the
variability of the circuit density and uniformize the
stresses exerted upon the wafer in the process of
CMP. It is expectable that the failure will be
reduced in the process of CMP.
Another objective of this research is to reduce
the complexity of data analysis. In order to reach
this objective, we use a circuit layout diagram as a
Blue Print to perform a two-stage clustering
analysis to reduce the complexity of the data. We
use Hierarchical Clustering method to determine
the number of clusters (k) and then put the
determined k into Nonhierarchical Clustering
method. Then we use Mathematical Optimization
method to solve the optimizing dummy circuits
problem under a current circuit design. In other
words, we consider the influence of dish effect and
then insert dummy circuits to reduce the
variability of the circuit density in the stage of
circuit design. When the Pattern Density Variance
in the wafer is minimum, it means that the surface
of circuit layout is close to a plane. Therefore, we
can reduce the probability of failure happened,
improve yield and then save the production cost.
三、研究方法
This research discusses the dish effect caused
by CMP in semiconductor manufacturing. Dish
effect affects the degree of planarization in wafer
surface which directly influence the yield of whole
wafer. Usually, semiconductor manufacturing
improves the degree of planarization by adding
dummy circuits such that the wafer surface can be
evener.
Furthermore, since wavelength will influence
the variation of depth of focus, we need to reduce
the concave and convex degree in wafer surface.
Therefore, the technique of eliminating caves in
wafer surface is important. This is because the cost
of material, operation and equipment is very
expensive. Yield loss will cause great damage for
semiconductor manufacturing. If we can find out
the possible reasons for yield loss and solve them
before the happening of manufacturing problems,
we can not only reduce the manufacturing cost but
also shorten the time to market.
Under the hypothesis of not violating the
circuit design rule, we analyze the circuit layout
diagram and use mathematical optimization
method in low-density region to add dummy

Data Analysis
This research desires to build a model and
reach the objective of optimization of uniformity
of CMP. In this section, data transformation and
data clustering method are discussed in detail.
Data Transformation
Before clustering and analyzing the data we
need to transform the circuit feature data into
analyzable type. Because circuit feature data in the
wafer are spatial data, in order to transform them
well, we label “1” to represent that there is a 
circuit and label “0” to represent that there is no 
circuit. By this way we can divide the wafer circuit
data into two categories as shown in Figure 3.
Then we calculate the tile density data as inputs of
clustering analysis as shown in Figure 4. Thus, we
can use the density data in each tile to divide the
circuit layout into high-density clusters and
low-density clusters.
Figure 3 Data transformation
Figure 4 Tile density transformation
Data Clustering
After transforming the circuit feature data
into circuit density data, we then proceed to
clustering analysis. In this research we use a
two-stage clustering method which decides the
number of clusters by a hierarchical cluster
analysis and the number can be used in
non-hierarchical clustering analysis. We adopt
Ward’s method which is a hierarchical cluster 
method to determine the number of clusters such
that k-means can use the result to obtain the
satisfied effect.
The Dynamic Window Size Setting
In the process of polishing, the degree of
dishing and erosion strongly depends on both the
processing parameters and layout factors (density
and pitch) [Park et. al., 1998]. The densities of
tile’s neighbor wilinfluence the process of CMP.
Its influenced range is between 1000um to 5000um
[Park et. al., 1999]. Andrew, Divecha and
Tomozawa took some tiles as a window, it can
reflect the fact that one tile may afect the tile’s 
neighbor on the wafer [Andrew et al.,
1999][Divecha et al., 1998][Tomozawa, 1997]. It
is shown in Figure 5.

The purpose of setting windows in the circuit
layout is to reflect the influence of the neighbor
circuit in CMP process. Thus, we set the window
size in accordance with the window density
variance of neighbor circuits dynamically. In order
to reach the objective that pattern density
uniformity on the wafer, one of our objective
functions is to minimize the window density
variance within clusters, it is shown as follow:

However, this does not indicate that the
whole variance of circuit density on the wafer is
minimal. We also hope that the window density
variance between clusters is also minimal.
Therefore, another objective function is to
minimize the window density variance between
clusters, it is shown as follow:

Therefore, in order to minimize the window
9circuits inserting in window (i,j). Furthermore, the
multi-objective optimization model:
2211 ZZZ   , where α1 and α2 express the
weight of objective function Z1 and Z2. The values
of α1 and α2 are in the range of 0 and 1.Besides,
the summation of α1 and α2 is 1. The adjusting
rules of parameter α1 andα2 are:
1. If we pay much attention to the window
variance within clusters rather than the window
variance between clusters, we will set α1 bigger
than α2. If we do not pay attention to the
window variance between clusters, we can set
α1 to be zero. So the objective function Z can be
ignored.
2. On the other hand, if we pay much attention to
the window variance between clusters rather
than the window variance within clusters, we
will setα2 bigger thanα1.
3. If the importance of the window variance
between clusters is the same as the window
variance within clusters, we will set

四、結果與討論
We use a circuit diagram provided by a
semiconductor enterprise to perform the
experiment of dummy circuits problem in CMP.
Data Transformation
In the circuit layout diagram, we observe
whether there is a circuit or not in each pixel. We
label “1” to represent that there is a circuit and 
label “0” to represent that there is no circuit. We 
divide our circuit layout diagram into 525*400
tiles which is 60um*60um and then calculate the
density each tile. It is shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6 Circuit density diagram
The density of the original circuit diagram is
shown in Figure 7. The scale for density is in the
bar to the right of the map. It is easy to see that the
circuit diagram is uneven everywhere.

diagram
Data Clustering
In this research we use a two-stage clustering
method. In the first stage, we proceed the Ward’s 
method to determine the number of clusters. We
list portion of the results in Table 1 and Figure 8.
There are R-square (R2) and semi-partial R-square
(SPR2) in Ward’s method from the number of 
clusters 20 to 1. Because R2 may be considered as
a measure of the degree of difference between
clusters and it should be high. SPR2 measures the
loss of homogeneity after merging the two clusters
11
influenced range to be about 1000um which can be
equal to 17 tiles nearly in this research. So we
adjust the window size by the variance of window
density dynamically. We decide three window
sizes 15, 17 and 19, determine the window size
with a largest density variance. The model of this
research is shown as follow:

Through the above model, we solve the
optimizing number of dummy circuits and insert
dummy circuits into those tiles. We can see that in
this way the variance of density on the wafer is
minimal and the condition of unevenness on the
wafer surface can be improved successfully.
Analysis of the Results
Before not inserting dummy circuits, the
mean density of original circuit diagram is 0.6456
(see Figure 7). After inserting dummy circuits
through the model which we developed, the mean
density increases from 0.6456 to 0.7752 (see
Figure 9).

inserting dummy circuits

of circuit density before and after inserting dummy
circuits.

clusters and high-density clusters. For the
high-density clusters we do not need any dummy
circuits. The method considers the problems
formed by CMP process and solves it in design
phase, so it hopefully can help reach a high yield.
We use a circuit diagram which is provided by
a semiconductor enterprise to proceed the
experiment of dummy circuits problem in CMP.
After inserting dummy circuits on the wafer the
mean density increases from 0.6456 to 0.7752 and
the density standard deviation reduces from
0.3178 to 0.1208. It shows that the condition of
unevenness on the wafer has significantly been
improved after inserting dummy circuits according
to the results of mathematical optimization model.
