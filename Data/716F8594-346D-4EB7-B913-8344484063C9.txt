 A series of poly(aryl ether)s derived from a bipolar monomer containing triphenylamine and 
1,2,4-triazole were prepared and used to test the behavior of resistive switching memory devices. 
The poly(aryl ether)s showed high thermal stability (Td10> 500 oC) and glass transition 
temperatures (Tg) higher than 187 oC as well as excellent solubility in organic solvents. The thin 
films of the poly(aryl ether)s indicated bistable resistive switching behavior, while the switching 
on and switching off bias voltages of the polymers were affected by the bisphenol moiety.

Accordingly, a novel aryl difluoride monomer containing electron-donor triphenylamine and 
electron-acceptor 1,2,4-triazole moieties is synthesized and used to prepare a series of poly(aryl 
ether)s with various bisphenols. The preparation, properties and memory behavior of the 
poly(aryl ether)s are investigated in this study.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials 
The materials, 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride (from ACROS), 4-fluoronitrobenzene (from 
ACROS), diphenylamine (from ACROS), phosphorus pentachloride (from Riedel-de Haën), 
hydrazine monohydrate (from Alfa Aesar), 10% palladium on activated carbon (from Merck) 
were used as received. The solvents, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), N,N-dimethylacetamide 
(DMAc), toluene and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from TEDIA, 
1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) was purchased from Aldrich and 
tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from ECHO. These 
solvents were purified by distillation over calcium hydride and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves. 
Acetic anhydride and pyridine were purchased from ACROS and used as received. The 
bisphenols, 2,2'-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol-A, a; from TCI), 
2,2'-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane (bisphenol-F, b; from CHRISKEV), 4,4'-bisphenol 
(c; from TCI), hydroquinone (d; from SHOWA), and bisphenol-S (e; from SHOWA) were 
recrystallized before use. 
 
Measurements 
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer GX FTIR spectrometer. NMR spectra 
were recorded using a BRUKER DRX-500 NMR (1H at 500.13 MHz and 13C at 125.76 MHz). 
Elemental analyses were made on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 instrument. The inherent viscosity of 
polyimide was measured by Ubbelohde viscometer. Thermogravimetric data were obtained on a 
PerkinElmer Pyris 6 TGA under nitrogen or air flowing condition at a rate of 20 cm3．min-1 and a 
heating rate of 20 ℃．min-1. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis was performed on a 
PerkinElmer Pyris DSC 6 under nitrogen flowing condition at a rate of 20 cm3．min-1 and a 
heating rate of 10 ℃．min-1. Absorption spectra were measured with a UV 500 UV-Visible 
spectrometer at room temperature in air. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with a 
PerkinElmer LS 55 Luminescence spectrometer. Weight-average (Mw) and number-average 
molecular weights (Mn) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at room 
temperature. Four Waters (Ultrastyragel) columns (300×7.5 mm, guard, 105, 104, 103, and 500 Å 
in a series) were used for GPC analysis with tetrahydrofuran (THF; 1 mL‧min-1) as the eluent. 
Polystyrene was used as the standard. The eluents were monitored with a UV detector (JMST 
Systems, VUV-24, USA) at 254 nm. The memory device was fabricated in the structure of 
metal/polymer/metal. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were precleaned by 
ultrasonication with water, acetone, and isopropanol, in that order. The polymer films of about 
50nm in thickness were spin coated on ITO from 50 mg/mL polymer solutions in THF, followed 
by solvent removal in a vacuum chamber at 10-5 Torr and 60℃ for 12 h. Thermal evaporation of 
the aluminum top electrode of about 0.16 mm2 in area and 0.1μm in thickness, through a shadow 
flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and heated with stirring to 160°C for 48 h. After cooling, 
the solvent was evaporated and washed with ethyl acetate. The crude product was recrystallized 
from ethanol to give 0.95 g (59% yield) of BFTPTZ: m.p. 252 oC (by DSC at heating rate of 10 
oC/min). FT-IR (KBr, cm-1): 1512 (C=N), 1096 (C-F); Elem. Anal. Calcd for C32H22F2N4

Preparation of polymers (Scheme 2) 
The synthesis of poly(ary1 ether)s was conducted in a similar manner as described here for 
the polymer PAE-a derived from BFTPTZ and bisphenol A.  
A 15-mL three-neck flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, and 
Dean-Stark trap fitted with a condenser was charged with 1.000 g (2 mmol) of BFTPTZ and 
0.457 g (2 mmol) of bisphenol A. The monomers were carefully washed into the flask with 5 mL 
of DMPU. An excess of K2CO3 (1.11 g, 8 mmol) and approximately 6 mL of dry toluene were 
added. The reaction mixture was heated to 145 oC, at which point the toluene began to reflux. 
Toluene was removed from the Dean-Stark trap, and more deoxygenated toluene was periodically 
added and then subsequently collected and drained from the trap. The reaction mixture was 
maintained at this temperature for 4-6 h to ensure complete dehydration of the reaction. The 
temperature was then increased to 180 oC, and the mixture was allowed to react for another 35 h. 
The polymer was precipitated into 500 mL of a methanol-water (1:1) solution followed with 
vigorous stirring prior to filtering. The precipitated polymer, PAE-a, was washed several times 
with methanol and dried under vacuum, 1.34 g (>97% yield). The yields were essentially 
quantitative for all of the polymerizations. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Monomer Synthesis  
There are a number of known synthetic routes to 1,2,4-triazoles.25,31 We used a three-step 
synthesis as shown in Scheme 1 to prepare the novel difluorine monomer BFTPTZ, containing 
electron-donor triphenylamine and electro-acceptor 1,2,4-triazoloe moieties. The fluorobenzoyl 
chloride was reacted with hydrazine hydrate to give hydrazide (FFBBH) and then chlorinated in 
the presence of phosphorus pentachloride to give chlorinated azine (DBFDB).23 The chlorinated 
azine reacted with 4-aminotriphenylamine (ATPA), which was prepared by the condensation of 
diphenylamine with 4-fluoronitrobenzene followed by reduction according to the reference30, to 
give the desired product BFTPTZ via a facile cyclocondensation reaction. In this reaction, it is 
necessary to remove the HCl generated during the reaction. Usually, the most convenient method 
is to use an excess of the arylamine to achieve it. In this reaction, excess 4-aminotriphenylamine 
(ATPA) was used. Elemental analysis, FTIR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR spectroscopic techniques 
were used to identify the structures of the intermediates and the desired difluorine monomer, 
BFTPTZ. The cyclocondensation of chlorinated azine to triazole ring could be monitored by the 
change of IR spectrum. The characteristic band of chlorinated azine at 1593 cm-1 disappeared and 
ether that is generated in the polymer forming reaction. For example, the polymer PAE-a 
exhibited characteristic bands at 1508 cm-1 for the 1,2,4-triazole ring and 1238 cm-1 for the aryl 
ether.  
Scheme 2 
The yield, inherent viscosity and molecular weight of the polymers are summarized in Table 
1. All poly(aryl ether)s were obtained in almost quantitative yields. The measured inherent 
viscosities of the polymers ranged from 0.16 to 0.35 dL/g. The weight-average molecular weights 
(Mw) ranged from 22000 to 40000 except polymer PAE-e as measured by gel permeation 
chromatography (GPC), relative to polystyrene standards. The viscosity is lower but molecular 
weight is moderate. The lower molecular weight relative to other systems with triazole moiety in 
the main chain25 is due to the triphenylamine electron-donor connected to the triazole ring. The 
triphenylamine moiety will increase the electron density and reduce the activity of the fluorine. 
NMR is a valuable tool for evaluating the electron-withdrawing effect of substituents in potential 
monomers. NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to electron density at the particular nuclei of 
interest. The protons ortho to the triazole ring appear around δ 7.5 (Figure 1A), we would 
suggest that this monomer is only weakly activated in comparison with other systems.25 The low 
molecular weight of PAE-e might result from the strong electron-withdrawing sulfone group, 
which reduces the nucleophilic ability of bisphenol. 
Table 1 
Properties of polymers 
The qualitative solubility property of the polymers is summarized in Table 2. Almost all 
polymers were soluble in some organic solvents, such as NMP, DMF, THF and chloroform. 
Especially, the polymer PAE-b exhibited excellent solubility than the others as it was readily 
soluble in a variety of solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMPU, THF, chloroform and toluene 
at room temperature. The excellent solubility of PAE-b is due to the 6FDA (fluorine effect).26-29 
However, polymers, PAE-c and PAE-d showed lower solubility due to the presence of rigid 
biphenylene and phenylene units. 
Table 2 
The thermal properties of the poly(aryl ether)s were evaluated by DSC and TGA. The 
results are summarized in Table 3. Calorimetric measurements on these poly(aryl ether)s show 
that these materials have glass transition temperatures in the range of 187-234 ℃ depending on 
the bisphenol used in the synthesis. The glass transition temperatures of these polymers are 
among the highest reported for poly(aryl ether)s prepared by nucleophilic aromatic substitution. 
The polymer PAE-d obtained from hydroquinone showed the highest Tg (234 ℃) due to the 
presence of rigid phenylene unit. The thermal stability of the polymers was evaluated by TGA 
measurements in both nitrogen and air atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 ℃．min-1. The 
temperatures for 10% weight loss of polymers in nitrogen and air atmosphere were higher than 
500 ℃ except polymer PAE-e. The poly(aryl ether)s exhibited high thermal stability and glass 
transition temperatures may due to the presence of rigid heterocyclic 1,2,4-triazole groups. There 
is a large window between Tg and the decomposition temperature of these polymers, which could 
be advantageous in the processing of these polymers by the thermoforming technique.

CONCLUSION 
A novel bipolar aryl difluoride monomer containing electron-donor triphenylamine and 
electro-acceptor 1,2,4-triazole moieties was successfully prepared and used in nucleophilic 
aromatic substitution reaction with various bisphenols to prepare poly(aryl ether)s. The poly(aryl 
ether)s showed high thermal stability and Tg higher than 187 oC and exhibited excellent solubility 
in organic solvents. The thin film of the polymers showed bistable electric switching behavior 
with a high ON/OFF current ratio. The resistive switching behavior of the poly(aryl ether)s made 
them promising candidates for future nonvolatile memory applications.

Abstract 
 
A novel bipolar aryl difluoride monomer containing electron-donor triphenylamine and 
electron-acceptor 1,2,4-triazole moieties was synthesized by a three-step synthesis. The 
1,2,4-triazole structure formed by a facile cyclocondensation reaction from 
4-aminotriphenylamine and chlorinated azine compound. The novel bipolar aryl difluoride 
monomer was used to prepare a series of poly(aryl ether)s via aromatic nucleophilic substitution 
reaction with various bisphenols. The structures of the monomer, intermediates and polymers 
were confirmed by NMR, IR and elementary analysis. The poly(aryl ether)s exhibited excellent 
solubility in organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, chloroform, toluene, 
dimethylacetamide and tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The inherent viscosities were 
0.28-0.35 dL/g. The poly(aryl ether)s showed high thermal stability with Td10 higher than 500 oC 
in nitrogen and glass transition temperatures (Tg) higher than 187 oC due to the rigid heterocyclic 
1,2,4-triazole groups. The memory effect of the poly(aryl ether)s was investigated by the I-V 
characteristics of ITO/Polymer/Al sandwich devices. The thin films of the poly(aryl ether)s 
indicated bistable resistive switching behavior with ON/OFF current ratios as high as 103. The 
switching on and switching off bias voltages of the poly(aryl ether)s were affected by the 
bisphenol moiety. The good resistive switching behavior of the poly(aryl ether)s made them 
promising candidates for future nonvolatile memory applications.
