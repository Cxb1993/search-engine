前言與研究目的 
Perioperative hemodynamic instability during anesthesia is an important clinical issue. Hypotension is 
associated with adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
1
 In addition, Monk et al. reported an 
association of intraoperative hypotension with increased mortality during the first year after surgery.
2
 One of 
the critical periods of general anesthesia during which hypotension is prevalent is the period after the 
induction of anesthesia but before surgical stimulation. There is evidence that some predictors are associated 
with the occurrence of hypotension in the period after anesthetic induction.
3,4
 Factors related to a patient’s 
history, baseline clinical state, and the anesthetic technique might be associated with an increased risk of 
postinduction hypotension.
5,6
 However it is difficult to evaluate the risk of hypotension when many predictors 
concomitantly exist. A model that integrates related factors and predicts the risk of hypotension would be 
helpful and of practical value for clinical anesthesia. 
Intelligence algorithms such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are machine-learning tools and powerful 
classifiers.
7
 In the past few years, ANNs have been widely used in computer-aided diagnosis,
8-10
 medical 
signal processing,
11,12
 and medical decision support.
13-17
 In this study we developed ANN models to identify 
patients at high risk of postinduction hypotension during general anesthesia. Furthermore, we validated the 
feasibility of the ANN models in comparison with a logistic regression (LR) model and clinicians’ 
impressions. 
研究方法 
Data collection 
This study was done with the approval of the Institutional Review Board at Taipei Medical University 
Hospital. Anesthesia records from Taipei Medical University Hospital for the period of March to November 
2007 were analyzed. In total, 1371 records were registered for which general anesthesia was the primary 
anesthetic technique. 
Blood pressure (BP) recordings were automatically obtained from oscillometric BP cuffs or an arterial line 
monitor and recorded in the anesthesia records by anesthetists. All data, including age, gender, height, weight, 
hematocrit level, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, history of hypertension, 
history of diabetes, surgical category, emergency status (ES), position for surgery, anesthetic technique, 
anesthetic regimen for induction (thiopental, propofol, etomidate, and fentanyl), neuromuscular blocking 
agents, heart rate (HR), and BP recordings (systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and mean arterial pressure) 
were extracted from the anesthesia records. Doses of anesthetics were calculated for the period of the 
anesthetic induction but before the onset of surgical stimulation. 
We restricted the analysis to commonly used intravenous anesthetic induction regimens. We excluded all 
patients who underwent inhalation induction of anesthesia, patients who had received more than one of the 
usual drugs to induce anesthesia (i.e., thiopental, propofol, or etomidate), or rarely used regimens (e.g., 
ketamine). After exclusion, 1017 records were included in the development of the predictive models. 
Variable selection 
 4 
equation were tested for exclusion on the basis of the probability of a log likelihood test ratio. The analysis 
ended when no further variables for inclusion or exclusion were available. Furthermore, LR was used to 
estimate the coefficients (β) of these variables. On the basis of the results, the probability of hypotension was 
estimated using the logistic equation. 
External validation dataset 
The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
were used to measure the discrimination of the models. Calibration is a measure of how close the predictions 
of a given model are to the real probability. In this study, calibration was assessed using the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit (H) statistic which divides subjects into deciles based on predicted 
probabilities and then computes Chi-squared values from the observed and expected frequencies.
19-21
 A 
statistically good fitness was defined as a p value of > 0.05. To provide an unbiased estimate of the models’ 
discrimination and calibration,
22
 these values were calculated from an external dataset which derived from 
anesthesia records for the period of March to June 2008 (in total, 343 records were registered for which 
general anesthesia was the primary anesthetic technique) which were not used in the model-building 
processing.  Using the exclusion criteria defined previously, 45 records were excluded and 294 records were 
used as the external validation dataset to evaluate the ANN and LR models. Statistical differences between the 
areas under the ROC curves for different models were evaluated according to the method described by Hanley 
and McNeil.
23-25
  
Prediction of clinicians 
The external validation dataset was presented to three anesthesiologists. For each patient, the data of the 
eighteen independent variables were listed and presented to every clinician. One clinician had worked in 
clinical anesthesiology for 17 years and was an assistant professor at a medical university. One had worked in 
clinical anesthesiology for 10 years and was a lecturer at a medical university. The third had worked in 
clinical anesthesiology for 6 years. The clinicians were asked to make predictions about whether the patient 
would experience a hypotensive episode or not (yes/no) during the postinduction period of general anesthesia 
according to the presented data on a case-by-case basis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of their 
predictions were calculated. 
結果 
The characteristics of patients, surgical, and anesthesia data, along with the distribution of hypotension of the 
training set and the external validation set are shown in Table 1. In total, 1017 samples were used to generate 
the predictive models, and 294 independent samples were used to validate the quality of the models. The 
prevalence of hypotension of the training dataset and the external validation dataset were 37.0% and 36.1%, 
respectively. There were no significant differences in the demographic data between the two datasets. 
The results of the LR analysis are summarized in Table 2. Five variables were included in the final LR 
model: age, gender, ES, ASA physical status, and baseline SBP.  
The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the ROC curves of the LR and ANN models are 
presented in Table 3. The ROC curves of the LR and ANN models are plotted in Figure 2. The H statistic of 
the ANN model with a p value > 0.05 indicated that the ANN model was well calibrated. The area under the 
ROC curve of the ANN was 0.893 indicating good discriminatory power. The area under the ROC curve of 
the LR model was 0.840. There were statistical differences between the areas under the ROC curves for the 
ANN and LR models (p < 0.05). The H statistic of the LR model with a p value < 0.05 revealed that it was not 
well calibrated. The calibration curves for the ANN and LR models are plotted in Figure 3. 
The accuracies of the prediction of clinicians were 52.7%, 53.1%, and 50.3%. The sensitivities were 29.2%, 
34.0%, and 35.8%; and the specificities were 66.0%, 63.8%, and 58.5%. The clinicians had the lowest overall 
accuracy and sensitivity compared to the ANN and LR models. 
 6 
In conclusion, the ANN model developed in this study had good discrimination and calibration and could 
be useful in providing decision support to clinicians and in increasing vigilance for those patients at high risk 
of postinduction hypotension during general anesthesia.
