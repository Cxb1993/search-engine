Abstract 
  Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has several advantages over the other fuel cells. Except the cost of 
the cell, the SOFC has high energy convergent ratio (>60%), no hazard waste give-off, versatile 
fuel supply, etc. Recent report pointed out that SOFC could be operated at the temperatures as low 
as 500oC. This project has completed five main tasks and mostly submitted to publish. The first is 
hosting a workshop of Bi-ionic conductor. Totally 6 speakers, two from University of Koeln, were 
invited and gave interesting lectures. (see Appendix 1). The second and the third subjects are 
relating to the synthesis of Nb- and Y-doped Bi2O3 electrolyte materials. We used colloidal 
dispersion method to process the powder mixtures, and compared the composition homogeneity to 
electric conductivity. (see Appendixes 2 and 3). The fourth subject is preparing RO(ZnO, BaO, 
CaO)-Bi2O3-SiO2-B2O3 multiple oxide system used as the sealing glass of previous Bi2O3 
electrolytes. The long-term test and the results are completed and shown in Appendix 4. The last 
subject is about the review of the sealing glass of SOFC. The paper has published in the Journal of 
Recent Patent in Materials Science (Appendix 5).

Solid state reaction method is often adopted to synthesize ceramic/composites, yet few reports 
on compositional homogeneity of doped Bi2O3 samples are seen in literature. The homogeneity in 
structure and composition is greatly concerned in this study. Therefore, colloidal processing, a 
desirable method to make uniform parts, was used to prepare mixtures of two materials.  
One way to achieve the goals is to assure that particles of different kinds are mutually 
repulsive to each other in suspension state. Thus, the prepared mixtures without agglomeration and 
good homogeneity are achievable. Properties of powder surface in aqueous solutions are essential 
for colloidal dispersion [14-16]. The interaction between aqueous solvent, polyelectrolyte 
dispersants and powder is significant and important to achieve stable suspension. Previous works 
suggest the chemical reactions happened in colloidal state and surface chemistry of the colloids of 
multiple compositions should be concerned. 
This work tries to prepare stable, homogeneous suspensions containing binary Nb2O5-Bi2O3 
powder mixture, and to sinter good ionic-conductive electrolyte of 21 mol% Nb2O5-doped Bi2O3 
sample (abbr. B21N). The dispersion behavior of each oxide by polyelectrolytic dispersant and the 
solubility of Bi and Nb in aqueous solutions will be studied. The compositional homogeneity and 
electric conductivity of sintered samples were also characterized by a statistic method to recognize 
the condition of colloidal dispersion between two oxide powders. 
 
2. Experimental Procedure 
2.1 Colloidal Processing of B21N 
 Bi2O3 (99.5% purity, Riedel-de Haen, Germany) and Nb2O5 (99.5% purity, Alfa Aesar, USA) 
powders were used for the following tests and syntheses of B21N samples. The Bi2O3 and Nb2O5 
powders were prepared at 28 vol% solid loading. After 24 hr of ball-milling, Bi2O3 or Nb2O5 
suspension was mixed in the atomic ratio of Bi:Nb= 79:21. After additional ball-milling for 2 h, a 
gas pressure of 10 kg/cm2 was applied in pressure-casting to drain the liquid. The green pacts then 
were sintered at 800oC for 2 hr. The sintered samples were analyzed as described in the following. 
 
2.2 Properties of Powders 
Sedimentation test: This experiment is dedicated to recognize the effectiveness of dispersant. 
Powder of 5 vol% with respect to DI water was added with different dispersants. The prepared 
slurry was ball-milled for a day and then poured into a graduated cylinder. The effectiveness of a 
dispersant can be judged by inspecting the sediment at the bottom of the cylinder. The dispersants 
in use are Darvan C (ammonium salt of polymethylacrylic acid, Venderbilt Co., USA), D-134 
(ammonium salt homopolymer with a 2-propenoic acid group, Dai-Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd., 
Japan), CDB (benzalkonium chloride, Sino-Japan Chemical Co. Ltd, Taiwan), and R2 (lauryl betain, 
Sino-Japan Chemical Co. Ltd., Taiwan). The first two are anionic dispersants and the others are 
cationic. 
 Zeta-potential Measurement: Powders were put into aqueous solutions of different pH 
values. After 1 h aging under room temperature, solutions were ultrasonicated for 10 min. Zeta-
meter (Zeta-Meter 3.0+, Zeta-Meter Inc., USA) was utilized to measure the zeta-potential of the 
ultrasonicated solutions. 
 Solubility of Powder in Aqueous Solutions: For the measurement of solubility, the 
powders were initially added in a concentration of 100 ppm or 4 wt% with different pH values. 
After aging in 30oC water bath for 30 min. or under room temperature for 14 days, the supernatant 
was taken to the measurement after the suspended particles were removed by centrifugation 
(HERMLE Z380, Germany). The solubility of leached elements was measured by inductive 
coupled plasma (ICP-AES, Jobin Yvon, Ultima 2000, France).  
Measurement of Residual Organic Substances: The measurement of the fraction of 
dispersant adsorption was conducted by total organic carbons (TOC, TOC 1000, OI Analytical, 
USA) with the sample preparing procedure identical to that of the solubility measurement, except 
that the Bi2O3 slurry was firstly ball-milled before separation of the supernatant and powder. 
Further dilution of the supernatant was necessary in case of over the detection range of the 
10 
 
adsorption on Bi2O3. It implies that the adsorption has not reached a saturation value even for 5 
wt% of dispersant addition. 
 Particle size was measured as an indication of the best powder mixing conditions. Figure 5 
shows the particle size evolution with varied solid loading and amount of dispersant. For Bi2O3 case 
(Fig. 5(a)), the slurry with 28 vol% of the powder and 1 wt% addition (based on powder) of D-134 
exhibits the smallest particle size, implying the best dispersion among all data. Therefore, the 
slurries, 28 vol. % solid loading of Bi2O3 and 1 wt% D-134, are the best. For Nb2O5 case, as shown 
in Fig. 5(b), four combinations seem to exhibit similar effects. 28 vol. % of Nb2O5 powder and 2 
wt% of Darvan C were chosen as the processing parameters to ball-mill the Nb2O5 slurry. 
 
3.2 Sintered Properties of Colloidal-Processed B21N 
 The sintered density of the samples was able to reach 97-99% theoretical density (T.D.) for 
samples sintered at 775-850oC for 2 hr. Fig. 6(a) shows a dense B21N micrograph taken in back-
scattered electron mode. No significant contrast appears. However, if separate dispersion was not 
performed, impurities will be resulted as seen in Fig. 6(b). EDS analysis revealed the bright-contrast 
spots to be Bi-rich portion, indicating non-uniform distribution of Nb. 
 Table I shows one set of EDS result testing on the as-sintered surface of B21N. Ten different 
locations were randomly selected and tested. One of the data was designated 21.0 mol% Nb in the 
first test; the remaining data were quantified according to the first one used as a standard spectrum. 
The standard deviation of Nb content is 0.19 mol%. This implies a probability of more than 99% 
that the Nb content of whole sample falls within 20.7±0.57 mol% ( ±3 times standard deviation). 
The other case of B21N prepared by pressure-casting was investigated and compared. The 
EDS test on the cross-section along the direction of pressure casting was also investigated. Fig. 7 
shows the homogeneity result, where the Nb content is slightly rich on top surface than the bottom 
(21.0 vs. 19.5%). The standard deviation (1 σ) of three positions ranging from +0.2 to +0.8%, 
greater than the case shown in Table I. In other words, the separation of Nb2O5 from Bi2O3 resulted 
from pressure casting step is obvious.  
 The electrical conductivity of three B21N samples is shown in Fig. 8. The sample that 
performed separate dispersion clearly shows a better conductivity than those without separate 
dispersion in the mixing step. The former (same as Table I) appeared more homogeneous, while the 
latter exhibited the microstructure of binary phase, as shown in Fig. 6(b). One reported case [11] is 
also shown in the figure, in which the best B21N with separate dispersion has the electric 
conductivity 100% and 530% better than the data [11] tested at 700oC and 450oC, respectively. 
 
4. Discussion 
4.1 Dispersion in Single Slurry System 
 In order to thoroughly disperse the powder in solution, the best dispersion conditions of each 
powder in aqueous condition should be determined prior to mixing. The best dispersant could be 
selected according to the data in Fig. 1. D-134 and Darvan C are both anionic dispersants that are 
negatively charged in neutral condition (7<pH<9). Powder also exhibits negative charged surface in 
this pH range (Fig. 2). Attraction between dispersant and powder seems not valid unless the electro-
static interaction involves the adsorption of multiple-valent ions (e.g. Bi3+) on negatively-charged 
polymer in the solution. One possible reaction is that Bi ions on Bi2O3 powder may dissolve into the 
solution and are anchored by charged polymer. It is inferred that Bi3+ ions are attached to the end 
function groups of negative D-134 chain. The molecular reaction of an acidic bond on D-134 can be 
expressed as below.    
    [CH2]n-COO- + Bi3+ Æ ([CH2]n-COO-Bi)2+                        (1). 
Other than the attraction between charged macromolecules and Bi ions, the molecules can be 
adsorbed on powder surface in neutral solution governed by the equation below 
(Bi-O)- + ([CH2]n-COO-Bi)2+Æ (Bi-O)-Bi+-COO-[CH2]n             (2). 
Besides the contribution of Bi3+, protons can also play the role as the charged polymer:  
(Bi-O)- + H+ Æ (Bi-O)-H+                                       (3)

Abstract 
 
Bi2O3 in delta (δ)-phase is a highly oxygen conductive material, and potentially selected as solid 
electrolyte of fuel cells. The oxide needs phase-stabilizer to improve its phase stability between 
room to operation temperature (25-650oC). Nb2O5 is selected so to ensure phase stability. Y2O3 is 
further included to demonstrate better ionic conductivity. The doped Bi-oxide materials were 
characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM and TEM in order to understand the homogeneity of the 
microstructure. Detailed discussion on the relationship between the electric conductivity of the Bi-
ionic materials and phases will be reported. 
 
Introduction 
 
Bismuth oxide exhibits high ionic conductivity due to high concentration (25%) of oxygen 
vacancies, and is a potential material for electrolyte applied for intermediate temperature-solid 
oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFC). However, a phase transformation occurs at 730oC from a highly-
conducting cubic (i.e. δ-) phase to a less-ordered monoclinic (α-) structure making the conductivity 
decrease, from 100 to 10-3 S.cm-1. This is apparently detrimental to the application. Accordingly, 
researchers have tried several dopants to stabilize the δ-phase and make the system into binary 
oxides.1  
Phase stability is a key issue. The material not only should be stable at the temperature range 
in use, but is sustainable in prolonged testing and non-ambient atmosphere, such as reduction 
atmosphere encountered on the cathode side of SOFC. There are literatures dealing with long-term 
annealing tests, for example, the Bi2O3-Y2O3 and Bi2O3-Er2O3 systems.2 These two systems have 
achieved the best conductivity among fluorite structure doped-Bi2O3 systems. However, 
conductivity decay was observed. Watanabe suggests there is impossible for Y2O3-Bi2O3 system to 
stabilize δ-phase to room temperature in long-term test.3 Therefore, there seems to be a tradeoff 
between high conductivity and phase stabilization. 
            In order to strike a balance of both stabilization and conductivity behavior, ternary 
systems have been widely considered. For example, Meng et al. suggests, for Y2O3 and Nb2O5 as 
dopants, that the stabilization of high conducting δ-phase can be achieved by a less dopant addition 
than that required for separate dopants, simultaneously maintaining high conductivity.4 Therefore, 
research effort on ternary systems for achieving both high conductivity and stability are worthy to 
be made. 
            Powder mixing route is one among the key steps of multiple oxide systems. Separate 
dispersion rather than mixing in a batch was performed during powder milling. In previous study, 
comparing the samples with or without separate dispersion, the homogeneity is better for samples 
with separate dispersion, while those without separate dispersion sometimes show impurity phases. 
Moreover, the total electric conductivity of samples with separate dispersion of two-oxide mixture 
system is much higher than those without separate dispersing.5 In this regard, a fully quantitative 
24 
 
methods was adapted to all Q-EDS measurements. Contents of all components were firstly assumed 
to be normally distributed and, according to statistical application, the distribution for small 
sampling (n<30) is governed by Student (t-) distribution.6 The mean value of a number of data 
points can be described by 
      (1), 
where n and xi are the number and the value of data points, respectively. Also the standard deviation 
(σ) of data points for small sampling is expressed by 
  (2). 
Some useful results concerning a normal distribution are listed below: 
  (3) 
  (4) 
  (5) 
where P means the probability that test value, x, appears in the specified range , μ and σ are true 
mean and standard deviation. The Student distribution is close to normal distribution except a 
function of sampling number. Furthermore, it is known that if the number of data points is less than 
4, these data are not able to be represented by the Student distribution. Therefore, the number of 
measurement should be at least 4. In this study, the number of measurements is >10 so closer to 
normal distribution, and with confidence level better than 95%. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Phase Identification 
Fig. 2 shows XRD spectrum of B15N-6Y (6 mol% Y2O3, 15 mol% Nb2O5 and 79 mol% Bi2O3, or 
Bi0.79Nb0.15 Y0.06O1.65) and B18N-3Y (3 mol% Y2O3, 18 mol% Nb2O5 and 79 mol% Bi2O3, or 
Bi0.79Nb0.18Y0.03O1.68) samples. No new phase other than Bi3NbO7 (#89-5564) has formed. The Nb 
and Y doping contents were based on a total 21 mol% doping level of Bi2O3. Both spectrums were 
identified to be Bi3NbO7, i.e. a pure bismuth niobate phase, and almost no other peaks are seen in 
the figure. Krok et al.7 have mentioned that Y2O3 doping causes small distortion in lattice 
parameters due to a larger Y3+ size. They suggested that Y3+ might have been dissolved into 
bismuth niobate matrix and expand the lattice.

further ball-milling for 2.5 hr C slurry was finally included; “(A,B)+C” means A and B slurries were mixed directly in a

Conductivity Measurement 
Fig. 3 shows the conductivity of B21N (21 mol% Nb2O5-doped Bi2O3, or Bi0.79Nb0.21O1.71), B18N-
3Y and B15N-6Y. It is seen that the more Y3+ replaces Nb5+, the higher the total conductivity. This 
is because of higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, and a more open structure (Y3+ is bigger 
than Nb5+) that let ions or vacancies move more easily. However, the conductivity of B21N, in 
which no Y2O3 was doped in, behaves better than 3 mol% Y2O3 doping. This can be attributable to 
the extent of homogeneity. The standard deviation of B21N samples were tested and reported to be 
0.19,5 better than that of B18Y-3Y, which is shown in Table 2. For the issue of applicability, the 
ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is better to exceed 10-2 S/cm for SOFC. Bismuth niobates and 
Y2O3-doped bismuth niobates are expected to exhibit almost pure ionic conduction (transference 
number ti>0.9) at above 600oC. In this study, the conductivity exceeds this criterion at 650oC for 
B21N and B18N-3Y and 500oC for B15N-6Y, almost the lowest temperature that intermediate-
temperature SOFC (IT-SOFC) has been reached. Therefore, these materials can be used as potential 
electrolytes.

and dense gaskets that avoid connection between oxidant and fuel gases.   
    The seals are necessary to be applied to oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, and suffer a 
temperature variation from room temperature to operation temperature, as high as 1000oC for HT- 
SOFCs and 650oC for IT- SOFCs. Therefore, they should be stable in a wide range of temperatures 
and oxygen pressure, and durable in frequent thermal cycles.  
Furthermore, the sealant has to be chemically stable in wet environment, and does not provide 
any path for ionic diffusion nor reaction with electrolyte and interconnect. Therefore, glass should 
be an electric insulator so as to prevent conduction. Also, in order to form a stable stack, sealant 
should be non-spreading to fuel cell components. 
Other important requirements of sealing glass include good wetting behavior, relaxation of 
thermal stress though either creep or viscous flow at operating temperatures. Table A1 lists generic 
functional requirements for SOFC seals.  
If the sealing materials contain Bi2O3, more precautions should be taken because   
extraordinary properties of Bi2O3 make this application harder, as illustrated below. Firstly, due to 
low melting point (~825oC) of Bi2O3, the operation temperature should be kept below 825oC in 
order to prevent volatilization and melting of bismuth ingredient. Secondly, Bi2O3-based materials 
show CTEs higher than 14 ppm/K; too high that few glass systems can meet the requirement. Lastly, 
neither reactions nor diffusion are allowed, especially for temperatures close to the melting point of 
Bi2O3. Table A2 lists some vital criteria of prospective sealing glass used for Bi2O3-based 
electrolytes. 
 
1.3 Effect of Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) on Sealing Glass 
    Like most solid substances, glass expands in heating and shrinks in cooling. It has something 
to do with the change in energy stored in the intermolecular bonds. It is important to match the CTE 
between sealing materials and cell components to be sealed. Otherwise cracks, defects, even 
breakdown would occur due to induced stresses as a result of thermal expansion. 
    Fig. A2 shows the CTE of most SOFC sealant materials and appropriate range for various 
SOFC applications. The materials qualified for use are mostly alkaline-earth-included borosilicate 
glasses. They are limited to be used at higher temperature (>600oC) because of high Tg, indicated as 
a rectangle in dashed line. A few research had been conducted on the intermediate-temperature 
region pointed out by a rectangle in solid line, where the temperature, Tg, is between 500-650oC.  
    From Fig. A2, it seems that doping alkaline earth can increase CTE of glass to the extent that 
can match that of common SOFC electrolyte material- yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ, with CTE of 
~11.5 ppm/K). In addition, borate glass decreases the tendency of crystallization and shows higher 
CTE than the other glass systems. Boron oxide is a common glass former that is added into silicate

2. Experimental Procedure 
 
2.1 Sample Preparation 
The oxide powders for glass melting were all prepared in a conventional solid-state mixing 
method. There are two systems, which have been investigated, containing Bi2O3, one is Bi2O3-BaO-
B2O3-SiO2 (abbreviated as “BB”) glass and the other is Bi2O3-CaO-B2O3-SiO2 (abbr. “BC”). Raw 
powders used in this process are Bi2O3, BaCO3 (>99.9% purity, J. T. Baker, USA), H3BO3 (99.8% 
purity, Riedel-de Haen, Germany), SiO2 (>99.9% purity, Harrison-Walker Refractories, USA) and 
CaCO3 (98% purity, Nacalai Tesque, Japan). The composition of each ingredient that forms BB and 
BC glass is listed in Table A3.  
The ethanol was added to the powder mixture, which was then ball-milled for a day, and then 
ethanol was vaporized in a rotary vacuum evaporator (EYELA, Japan). After totally dried in a 90oC 
oven, the resulted powder of 20-25 g was placed in a platinum crucible and melted at 1200oC. The 
glass frit-chips were obtained by quenching the molten powder directly into distilled water. The 
procedure of fabricating BB and BC glass powders are summarized in Fig. A3.  
    Materials used in joint test were B21N and YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2, Teamcera, 
Taiwan), each being made as a pellet. B21N was fabricated via colloidal processing, while YSZ 
pellet was made by die-pressing as-received 8Y-SZ powder. In addition to BB glass, another two 
glass systems were used, G1A5 (prepared by Exojet Technology Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) 
and G6 glasses. Both are boro-alumino-silicate glass systems. The composition of each ingredient 
of G1A5 and G6 can be found elsewhere.

2.2 Characterization Methods 
 
2.2.1 Properties of Glass 
    Properties of a glass system can be investigated from several characterization techniques. 
Among them, thermal properties may be the most important part. Thermomechanical analyzer 
(TMA, TMA 2940 Analyzer, TA instruments, DuPont, USA) was used to measure the CTE of a 
glass and to determine the softening point (Ts). Differential thermal analyzer (DTA, SDT Q600, TA 
Waters LLC, USA) was used to measure the glass transition (Tg), crystallization (Tc) and melting 
temperature (Tm). The contact angle analyzer (Contact Angle System, OCA15, DataPhysics, 
Germany), composed of a tubular furnace and a camera, was used to measure the wetting angle 
between glass and electrolyte at high temperatures. 
    Microstructural observation was conducted under SEM (some data are from SEM, JEOL JS2-
6360LV, JEOL Ltd., Japan), and quantitative analysis was done by EDS (some data are from EDS, 
Oxford INCA-400, Oxford Instruments, UK) attached to the SEM. Semi-quantitative analyses on 
glass systems were performed. XRD (X’Pert PRO, PANalytical Co., Netherlands) was used to 
identify possible crystalline phases and estimate the extent of crystallization. 
 
2.2.2 Interfacial Analysis on Glass Systems Sandwiched between Electrolyte Materials 
    B21N and YSZ, that are prospective SOFC electrolyte materials, were used in the 
experiments. Two types of interfacial investigations were conducted. One is by sandwiching a 
designated glass between two B21N bulks; the other is by sandwiching a glass between B21N and 
YSZ bulk materials. Then both of them were heated to a certain temperature for good sealing at a 
ramp rate of 10oC/min., and held at that temperature for 15 min., assuring the glass became fully 
melted. The interfaces were observed under SEM. Line scan elemental analyses by EDS were done 
to check if any diffusion had taken place. 
 
3. Results and Discussion

3.1.1 Thermal Properties 
DTA curve is shown in Fig. A4, which shows several crystalline peaks observed before 
melting, while the glass transition occurs at about 450oC. Figs. A5 (a) and 5(b) show the TMA 
curves of BB glass pellets in as-quenched state and annealed (600oC, 10 hr) . The CTE of Β21Ν is 
around 14 ppm/K (TMA results not shown here), while that of reported barium silicate crystalline 
phase in the annealed sample is around 9-14 ppm/K. [91] Therefore, there is not much difference in

3.3 Interface Analyses on Sandwiched Glasses and B21N  
In this analysis, the glass was placed between two B21N bulk substrates. BB glass and G6 
were the glass systems to be investigated. 
 
3.3.1 B21N/BB glass/B21N Interface 
SEM micrograph of the B21N/BB glass/B21N interface is shown in Fig. A11. The sandwich 
was heated at 850oC at a ramp rate of 10oC/min. and held for 15 min for sealing. The micrograph 
shows a layer of porous area that indicates the location of the interface. However, no interface layer 
is appearing. In addition, line scan for Si mapping (Fig. A11(b)) shows consistent concentration, 
which means silicon, a component of BB glass system, has uniformly diffused toward both sides of 
the interface, and the reacted layer has expanded more than 70 μm. In other words, the glass layer 
had disappeared and diffused into both substrates. This is resulted from the heat treatment with the 
temperature exceeding the melting point of Bi2O3, causing volatilization and enhanced diffusion of 
bismuth. The relatively high porosity can be accounted for weakened interface resulted from the 
diffusion of Bi. The porosity may be resulted from grain pull-outs occurred on the weak interface 
during sample grinding. 
 
3.3.2 B21N/G6/B21N Interface 
    The sandwiched interface was fired to 950oC, holding for 15 min, in order to assure that G6 
glass can wet on B21N. Fig. A12 shows the resulted interface, which is similar to B21N-BB glass-
B21N interface. The G6 glass layer had disappeared as well, resulting in relatively high porosity. 
 
3.4 Analyses in Glass Systems Sandwiched between B21N-YSZ Interfaces 
There are three glass systems to be sandwiched between B21N and YSZ substrate, which are 
G6, G1A5 and BB glass. Three joined interfaces are shown in Fig. A13. All of them show similar 
trend according to the line scan results. Similarly, Zr and Nb diffusion into YSZ and B21N have 
occurred. There are abundant in Zr and Nb, respectively, appeared on the other side of interface. 
However, less Bi diffusion was observed. After Bi started volatilization above its melting point, Zr 
and Nb diffused out; Bi acted as “flux” to aid diffusion of other species. Nb and Zr had experienced 
widespread diffusion as seen in the figures. Moreover, Ba, a main component of glass systems, had 
also diffused throughout the sample, thereby making the glass layers disappeared. 
 
In summary, almost the same results were observed for all joint experiments.  
1. The glass layer disappeared, Bi has volatilized and weakened the interface, and  
2. Almost every element have diffused to the other side of the interface. Therefore, common high-
temperature sealing glass materials are not suitable for bismuth-based electrolytes.

INTRODUCTION  
 Recent demand of portable fuel cells (FCs) from 3C industries has driven the development 
of new technologies in order to improve the performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). 
Miniaturization and reduction of operation temperature are two major objectives that are generally 
recognized in the R&D of SOFC. [1,2] Up to date, several important breakthroughs on the 
performance of SOFC were reported in past few years. Stable operation life (>20,000 h) by 
Siemens-Westinghouse, [3] high fuel efficiency (>45% without heat recovery) by Julich (Germany), 
[4] and 500oC operation temperature by TOTO (Japan), [5] have achieved new records in this field. 
Those cases provide the evidences of potential applications of SOFC standing for new energy-
convergent devices. 
 One major shortage of SOFC is that all electro-chemical devices should operate at high 
temperature. The operation of SOFC, at present, still needs the temperatures higher than 500oC. The 
leakage of fuel and oxidant from the gaps between the components of SOFC at the operation 
temperatures should be prevented. One of the solutions is using sealing materials. The other is 
rarely reported by using a seal-less cell design. [6] The former solution has been practiced in several 
patent applications [7-26] and papers [28-30].  The main differences between them are the 
chemical composition of the sealing materials, e.g. glass, glass-ceramics, or glass-composites, and 
sealing designs of the SOFC structures.   
Glasses in very wider compositions have been designed to have unique properties for many 
scientific and engineering applications. Most of inorganic glasses and partially crystallized glasses 
(called “glass-ceramics”) can be processed as easy as molten glass or ceramic powder. The glass 
powder can easily composite with ceramic or metallic particulates, so performs very wide range of 
properties, for instance from electric insulator to electric conductor. [7] The final products have the 
mechanical properties as strong as a polycrystalline ceramic. As a result, multiple functions of 
glass-ceramics are known for decades and being widely applied in various applications. [31] 
The composition of patented inorganic glasses, which are mostly cited in US or the other 
countries, contains silicate in past century. [32] As the secondary and third choices, borate and 
phosphate glasses are noted, and known as major glass former. There are more than 1060 US 
patents with the keyword of “solid oxide fuel cell” since 1984. If taking “solid oxide fuel cell” in 
combined with “sealing glass”, “solder glass” or “sealing”, 22 patents can be sorted out [6-26, 33] 
from US patent data resource. [34]  
The number of SOFC patents counted by year is plotted in Figure 1, in which the patent 
number increases significantly from 1995, and reaches its plateau (>100 patents) after 2003. 
Correspondently, the patenting of sealing glass starts from 1993 [8], and gets much attention after 
54 
 
12 out of the 22 sealing patents report their CTE values of sealing glasses. The CTE of the 
seals must match other cell components, mainly the electrolyte in order to minimize the thermal 
stresses induced during temperature cycling. The CTE of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte 
is in the range of 10-11.5x10-6/K depending on the temperature range. Not only the materials of 
electrodes and all connectors, but the seals should have matched CTE with the electrolyte.  
The glass transition temperature is one of the thermal characteristics of glass and is a 
strong function of the chemical composition of glass. The Tg value is also influenced by the size of 
glass powder. [27] The smaller the particle size, the lower the Tg and crystallization temperatures. 
This property is an important indicator of wetting and flowing of the glass when fills in gap. In 
order to provide an adequate sealing function, the glassy seal maintains sufficient mechanical 
integrity and compliant properties to adapt slightly dimensional mismatch of cell components.  
Gas-leakage recently became the important issue for long-term application of the cells. 
[17,25,26,33]  The conditions were conducted at the temperature below 0oC to as high as the 
operation temperatures of 850oC, and with many thermal cycles and holding time as long as 550 hr. 
There was a very low leak of 1x10-2 sccm/cm between 600-850oC claimed in the patent. [26] The 
details of the composition and its design will be mentioned in the next section. 
The strength of glass determines the mechanical performance of the seal during thermal 
cycling, especially at the temperature below Tg. The glass is sensitive to tensile stress and any types 
of mechanical vibration [28,33] The strength of glassy materials typically reaches 150 MPa without 
degradation. This property determines the mechanical design of the structures of cell system, 
especially used in 3C portable or automobile applications. 
There are several interesting properties pointed-out in literature relating to long-term 
applications of the glass seals. The longest testing at 850oC for 550 hr was reported by Xue et al. 
[17]. In addition, the tests of the corrosion of glass by 4% H2/N2 up to 4 days [22], thermal cycling 
for 74 times [26], and the effects of crystallization of the glass on CTE [16,17] were also mentioned. 
Detail analysis of the changes of Tg, wetting angle, strength, CTE, and leak rate of gas was 
concerned as a cell aged. It is very difficult to get consistent glass-ceramic properties to meet all 
requirements in considering the practical life time of the SOFC used for portable or stationary 
applications.  
     
CHEMISTRY of GLASS-CERAMIC SYSTEM 
Only 21 US patents have demonstrated the uses of sealing glasses for SOFC (Table 1). They 
have the claims covered the glass compositions and applications that pursue the need properties in 
previous section. Basically, three types of the material systems of the seals are classified and shown 
as below.  
56 
 
electrolyte, which was only 8-YCZ mentioned in their examples. The composition of the glass 
(named G-18) was developed since 1999 to have good interfacial properties with the metal (430SS 
with bond coating) and 8 mol%Y2O3 doped CS (8YCZ). Besides, bond-coat (Fe-Al and MCrAlY) 
alloys were also used to compensate the thermal stresses on metal part (430SS) in order to limit 
interface diffusion of metallic species. Several properties, breaking strength, peeling load, and low 
leakage rate were reported in their patent examples as well. 
 Alkaline earth oxides, MgO and BaO, were used mostly to increase the CTE values of the 
sealing glass. Wang et al. [18] used 45-49 mol% MgO or 40-50 mol% BaO as the main 
compositions, and some of glass formers, B2O3 (10-21%) and SiO2 (7.5-35%) in their glass 
formulations. The additional ingredients, CaC (0 or 10%), ZnO (0, 5, 8%), Al2O3 (0 or 10%), and 
MgO+BaO were all refractory materials. The formulation rich in refractory ingredient needs careful 
planning on the sealing. The functions of melting and sealing offered by minor constituents of the 
B2O3 and SiO2 take engineering effort to find the processing window of melting and sealing. Their 
patent did not mention any properties of the glass-ceramics.  
 
(3) Electric Conductive Sealing Composites  
The glasses included metallic particles were developed in order to have electric conductive 
function, so to collect current from electrode and to bond cell components. [7,11, 33] Metallic 
particles, either W. Ta, Nb, Mo, Ti, [11], Ag, Au or Ag+Pd, [33] were used as electric conductive 
ingredients. The seals usually in paste form consist of various oxides, metallic particulates, 
polymeric binder, and solvents. The as-mentioned mixture can be applied on component surface as 
a bonding material. Oxide powders by AlliedSignal (US) in a content up to 30 wt% mixed with the 
metallic ingredients in the range of 1-50 wt% (Table 1). After sintering, the bonding showed the 
shear strength greater than 1 MPa. No electric properties or thermal expansion properties were 
claimed. A follow-up patent [13] also filed by AlliedSignal on Jul 1999 disclosed similar composite 
sealing materials, but the metallic alloy particles had the additional function, which was a filler for 
the gap in SOFC.    
The other case was disclosed by Dornier (Germany) [7] that the conductive phase was 
perovskite materials with specified composition of (La,M1)(Cr,M2)Ox, where M1 and M2 are 
selected metallic species. This composite mixed with 1.0-20 wt% glass material to have a 
conductivity better than 0.1 S/cm at 1000oC. The CTE of the conductive seal is well match with 
YSZ with tunable values between 8.0x10-6/K and 12.0x10-6/K.   
 
OTHER PROGRESS in PATENTING GLASS SEALING 
 
58 
 
systems in contact with CeO2 materials are still unknown in literature, but soon will be seen in 
Japan patent applications. 
Glass-ceramics can be an insulator with a resistivity better be than 106 ohm/cm, or better than 
0.1 S/cm as a conductor. Fairly wide electric conductivity of the glasses or glass composites can be 
achieved by engineering the composition of the material systems. Different structure parts, other 
than sealing, can consider the possibility of using glass-ceramics as the material.   
 Several potential electrolyte systems, CeO2-based or BiMeVOx, are in the stage of research. 
The improvements of the properties of those potential solid electrolytes are still in progress. As 
soon as a new electrolyte material is available, the manufacturing g of cell system needs new glass 
systems to meet all the requirements for the development of SOFC.  The CTE, Tg, and several 
properties are determined by the temperature of cell operation in future developments of a new cell 
system. The change of applicable electrolyte material will drive the development of totally new 
glass system.
