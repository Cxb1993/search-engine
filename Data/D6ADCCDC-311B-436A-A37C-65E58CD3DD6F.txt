摘要 
 
   本研究主要目的是探討石油化學品供應網路之規劃及排程,原油在供應鏈中
被轉化成許多不同石油化學產品,例如：乙烯、丙烯、液化石油氣、丁烯、苯、
甲苯、對二甲苯、汽油、煤油、柴油．．．等主產物及其他的副產品，而這些產
品多半藉由數個策略性建置的轉化精煉廠所製造出來的。一個完整的石化品供應
鏈至少須包含 13 個操作單元，即：常壓蒸餾塔、真空蒸餾塔、流體化床觸媒裂
解單元、輕石油腦裂解單元、丁烯分離單元、氫處理單元、苯環類分離單元、重
組單元、二甲苯分離單元,對位二甲苯分離單元、對二甲苯轉換單元、苯轉換單
元。傳統製造鏈之生產規劃會先被執行,再根據不同時期所需之產量去訂定排
程。然而詳細排程的限制條件在規劃時常常被忽略掉,因此不能保證此一層級式
規劃排程步驟之可行性。為了解決這類問題,我們使用單一混整數規劃模式
(MILP)來同時決定規劃及排程的各項參數，以便將供應鏈整體利潤最大化。藉由
這個模式可以提供我們最佳的原油採購量、產品供應量、最適的採購時期和對應
的製造流程。並且可得知每個時期間各個單元的進料量、反應單元的操作模式、
及適當的庫存量。 關鍵詞: 石化品供應鏈、混整數線性規劃、生產規劃與排程 
 
Abstract 
 
The overall scope of this study is concerned with the petroleum supply network 
operated by a typical oil company, in which the crude oil is consumed to produce 
ethylene, propylene, liquefied petroleum gas, butadiene, benzene, toluene, xylene, 
gasoline, kerosene, diesel and other by-products. These petrochemical products are 
usually manufactured with a cluster of strategically-located conversion refineries 1 . A 
complete petroleum supply chain consists of at least 13 different types of production 
units, i.e., the atmospheric distillation units, the vacuum distillation units, the cokers, 
the fluid catalystic cracking units, the naphtha crackers, the butadiene extraction units, 
the hydroytreaters, the aromatics extraction units, the reforming units, the xylene 
fractionation units, the parex units, the xylene isomar units, and the tatory units. 
Traditionally, the production plan of an industrial supply chain is created first and a 
compatible schedule is then identified accordingly. Since the detailed scheduling 
constraints are often ignored in the planning model, there is no guarantee that an 
operable schedule can be obtained with this hierarchical approach. To address this 
issue, a single mixed-integer linear program (MILP) has been formulated in this study 
to coordinate various planning and scheduling decisions for optimizing the supply 
chain performance. Solving this MILP model yields the proper procurement scheme 
for crude oils, the schedules for producing various petrochemical products, and the 
corresponding logistics. The appropriate sources (suppliers) of raw materials, the 
Planning (MRP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) production. Dogan and Grossmann5 
constructed a multi-period MILP model to integrate planning and scheduling 
decisions for continuous multi-product plants that consist of a single processing unit. 
It should be noted that, although interesting results have been reported in the above 
papers, none of them were concerned specifically with the operation of conversion 
refineries. 
 
2. Production Units in a Conversion Refinery 
 
Import and export facilities: The crude and other intermediate oils are usually 
imported by tankers to terminals equipped with jetties and storage tanks. These 
terminals can also be utilized to facilitate exportation. A pipeline network is available 
for connecting the jetties to the crude storage tanks. 
Atmospheric distillation unit: The crude oil is separated in an atmospheric 
distillation unit into a wide variety of products, i.e., light compounds with 3 and 4 
carbon atoms (i.e., C3s and C4s), light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene, diesel and 
residual oil .  
Vacuum distillation unit: The vacuum distillation operation is needed for separating 
the less volatile components, e.g., the lubricating oils, from the residual oil without 
subjecting these high-boiling hydrocarbons to the cracking conditions.  
Coker: Coking is a type of thermal-cracking operation used to convert the low-value 
by-products of vacuum distillation to coke, gas, and distillates.  
Fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) units: The raw materials of FCC process are 
residuum cuts ranging from crude tower bottoms to vacuum bottoms, including 
residua high in sulphur or nitrogen contents. The cracking reactions take place in the 
fluidized bed where the catalyst is dispersed in the hydrocarbon vapours. 
Naphtha cracker: Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is carried out in the refining 
process to produce ethylene, propylene, butadiene and other unsaturated compounds 
with higher molecular weights. The pyrolysis gasoline must be first treated in a 
hydrogenation process to remove the olefins, diolefins and sulphur contents, and then 
sent to the aromatics extraction units.  
Butadiene extraction unit: From the steam cracker, the mixture of C4 hydrocarbons 
contains 30 to 50% butadiene plus butane, 1-butene, 2-butene, isobutylene and small 
fractions of other hydrocarbons. A two-stage extractive distillation process is applied 
to achieve butadiene separation.  
Hydrotreater: Hydrotreating is generally used for improving product quality without 
appreciable alteration of the boiling range. In our study, the naphtha hydroytreater and 
platformer are combined and considered as an integrated unit.  
paper published by Kuo and Chang6 . In order to address both planning and 
scheduling issues simultaneously in an integrated mathematical program, two 
different time scales must be defined for these two tasks respectively. Specifically, let 
us introduce two distinct sets of time intervals, i.e. 
{ }|   is the label of the th planning periodtp tp tp=TP
       
 (1) 
{ }|   is the label of the th scheduling interval in the th planning periodtp ts ts ts tp=TS

4. Supply Chain Structure 
 
To facilitate construction of a comprehensive system structure, let us assume that 
one buffer-tank system is available for every feedstock and one for every product in 
each processing unit of the generalized supply chain.  It is also assumed that a mixer 
is installed before the former tank and a distributor is installed after the latter. The 
inputs of mixers in a production unit are originated from the distributors in upstream 
source units of its feeds and, similarly, the distributors in this unit are linked to the 
mixers in downstream sink units of its products. To construct an integrated planning 
and scheduling model, the unit models must be augmented with a complete 
mathematical description of the supply chain structure.  These formulations are 
outlined below: 
4.1 Mixer and Distributor Connections 
The material balance around a mixer can be written as

where,

by unit u ;

buffer tank in unit u  during interval ts ; 
, , ,u u s tsq ′  represents the accumulated amount 
of feedstock s  transported from unit u′  to unit u  during interval ts . On the other 
hand, the material balance around a distributor can be formulated with a similar 
equation, i.e.

where, crudeS  denotes the set of overseas suppliers of crude oils; vP  represents the 
set of different types of crudes provided by supplier v ;  ,v mtpTS denotes the set of 
scheduling intervals (within the planning period tp ) in which shipment of crude m  
from supplier v  can be scheduled (i.e., ,v mtp tp⊂TS TS ); , ,v m tsQCS  represents the 
amount of crude m  that can be obtained from supplier v  during the scheduling 
interval ts . Notice that, if ,v mtpts ∈TS , the binary variable { }, , 0,1Crv m tsi ∈  denotes 
whether or not the crude is selected. However, the constraint 
, ,
0Crv m tsi =  should be 
imposed if ,v mtpts ∉TS . 
  It is assumed that the major petrochemical products of the supply chain, i.e., 
ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, toluene and xylene, can also be purchased 
from oversea suppliers to fulfill contract obligations to the customers. A set of 
equality constraints are thus included in the model, i.e.

which shipment of product m  from supplier v  can be scheduled (i.e.,

can be expressed as: crude hvynap litnap mxyl pet=S S S S S SU U U U .
