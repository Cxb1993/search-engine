I. INTRODUCTION
Unknown inputs filtering has played a significant
role in many applications, e.g. bias compensation
(Hsieh & Chen, 1999; Ignagni, 2000), geophysical
and environmental applications (Kitanidis, 1987),
and fault detection and isolation problems (Chen,
1996). As is known (Hsieh & Chen, 1999), when the
statistics of the unknown inputs is perfectly known,
then the optimal state estimator can be represented
by the optimal two-stage Kalman filter (OTSKF),
which can be seen as a special implementation of
the KF via the TSKF structure. However, this TSKF
is limited to systems with unknown inputs that have
a prescribed statistical model. To be more general, it
may not be any knowledge concerning the model of
the unknown inputs.
A general approach to solve the aforementioned
state estimation for unknown inputs that have ar-
bitrary statistics is to apply unknown-input decou-
pled state estimation. Among these, four major ap-
proaches have been used in the literature. The first
is unbiased minimum-variance estimation (UMVE)
(Kitanidis, 1987; Chen & Patton, 1996; Darouach
& Zasadzinski, 1997; Darouach, Zasadzinski, &
Boutayeb, 2003; Hsieh, 2006; Hsieh, 2007a). In
this approach, the filter parameters are first deter-
mined to satisfy some algebraic constraints according
to the unbiasedness requirements of the filter. In
general, the solutions of the algebraic constraints
are parametrized by some parameter matrices. Next,
the parameter matrices are determined such that
the estimation error variance is minimum. A robust
version of the optimal UMVE and a parameterized
minimum-variance filter (PMVF) were also proposed
to solve the robust filtering problem for uncertain
systems with unknown inputs (Hsieh, 2007b). The
second is the equivalent system description (ESD)
method (Hou & Mu¨ller, 1994; Hou & Patton, 1998).
In this approach, an equivalent system description
for designing an unknown-input decoupled filter for
the considered system is first given. Then, the linear
minimum-variance estimation is derived by making
use of the innovations filtering technique. The sys-
tem considered in Hou and Patton (1998) has the
general form where the unknown inputs affect both
the system model and the measurements and the
system and measurement noises are correlated. In the
third, the filter is designed based on state estima-
tion techniques for descriptor systems (Nikoukhah,
Campbell, & Delebecque, 1999). The last is joint
input and state estimation (JISE) (Hsieh, 2000;
Hsieh, 2007c; Gillijns & De Moor, 2007a; Gillijns
& De Moor, 2007b; Palanthandalam-Madapusi, &
Bernstein, 2007). In Hsieh (2000), the UIF problem
is solved by applying the robust two-stage Kalman
filtering (RTSKF) technique, which is obtained by
making the OTSKF independent of the underlying
input model. Recently, a specific extension of the
RTSKF has been proposed serving as a useful mean
to derive the unified structure of unbiased minimum-
variance reduced-order filters (Hsieh, 2007d). The
result of Hsieh (2000) has also been extended to
the more general system with unknown inputs that
affect both the system model and the measurements,
which is named as the ERTSKF (Hsieh, 2007c). In
Gillijns and De Moor (2007a), a recursive filter is
developed where the estimation of the state and input
are interconnected. The input estimate is obtained
from the innovation by least-squares estimation and
the state estimation is transformed into a standard
Kalman filtering problem. The result of Gillijns and
De Moor (2007a) has been extended to the more
general unknown input filtering problem (Gillijns
& De Moor, 2007b), where the state estimation
is solved using the method developed in Kitanidis
(1987).
This research considers the optimal filtering for
systems with unknown inputs that affect both the
system model and the measurements via the JISE
approach. It should be noted that the filter developed
in Gillijns and De Moor (2007b), which is named as
the recursive three step filter (RTSF), has the most
recent result. However, the RTSF is obtained only
when the input matrix from unknown inputs to output
has full column rank. Unfortunately, this input matrix
rank constraint in general may not hold. If this is
the case, the unbiasedness of the obtained unknown
input estimator may not be guaranteed, and hence the
estimation of the system state may become a biased
one. Thus, in this research, we continue the research
in order to deriving a unified filter structure for sys-
tems with unknown inputs that may or may not have
a prescribed statistical model, and further purpose
a parameterized three-stage Kalman filter (PTSKF),
which serves as a unified solution to UMVE for
systems with unknown inputs that affect both the
system and the outputs. The PTSKF is characterized
by two design parameters and includes three parts:
one is for the main system state estimate, the second
is for the optimal unknown inputs estimate, and the
last is added to further enhance the robust filtering
performance. It is shown that the aforementioned
ERTSKF and OTSKF are special cases of this new
2
in which M+ denotes any one-condition generalized
inverse of M , i.e., MM+M =M , and
Vk = F¯k−1 −K x¯k S¯k (19)
S¯k =
[
Gk Sk
]
, Sk = HkFk−1 (20)
Ck = HkP x¯k|k−1H
′
k +Rk. (21)
The unbiasedness constraint of the above ARTSKF
is given as follows:
F¯k−1 − F¯k−1Kdk S¯k = 0. (22)
The other, on the other hand, is obtained by de-
coupling the unknown inputs from the measurement
equation. This is achieved by pre-multiplying (2) by
Tk = I −GkG+k (23)
which leads to
Tkyk = TkHkxk + Tkvk. (24)
Note that (24) exists only if rank[Gk] < p. The
obtained ERTSKF is named as the DRTSKF, which
is the alternative of the one presented in (Hsieh,
2007c), and is listed as follows:
xˆk = x¯k|k + V¯kdk|k (25)
Pk = P x¯k|k + V¯kP
d

k (26)
where x¯k|k is given by
x¯k|k−1 = Ak−1xˆk−1 +Bk−1uk−1 (27)
x¯k|k = x¯k|k−1 +K x¯k (yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (28)

k (30)
P x¯k|k = (I −K x¯kHk)P x¯k|k−1 (31)
dk|k is given by
dk|k = Kdk(yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (32)
Kdk = P
d

kC¯
+
k (33)
P dk|k = {S′kC¯+k Sk}+ (34)
and V¯k is given by
V¯k = Fk−1 −K x¯kSk. (35)
The unbiasedness constraint of the above DRTSKF
is given as follows:
Fk−1 − Fk−1KdkSk = 0. (36)
Now, we are in the position to show the
conditions under which the ARTSKF is equivalent
to the DRTSKF. To achieve this, the ARTSKF and
the DRTSKF are each reformulated as the Kitanidis’
UMVF form (Kitanidis, 1987).
1) ARTSKF-based UMVF:
xˆk = x¯k|k−1 + Lak(yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (37)
Pk = (I − LakHk)P x¯k|k−1(I − LakHk)′

Vk = F¯k−1 −K x¯k S¯k, P ak|k = (S¯′kC−1k S¯k)+ (40)
and K x¯k is given by (14). The gain matrix L
a
k
and Lagrange multipliers Λak satisfy the following
constraint:[
Ck −S¯k
S¯′k 0

=
[
HkP

k|k−1
F¯ ′k−1
]
. (41)
2) DRTSKF-based UMVF:
xˆk = x¯k|k−1 + Ldk(yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (42)
Pk = (I − LdkHk)P x¯k|k−1(I − LdkHk)′
+LdkRk(L

where
Ldk = K

k = V¯kP
d
k|k (44)
V¯k = Fk−1 −K x¯kSk, P dk|k = (S′kC¯+k Sk)+ (45)
and K x¯k is given by (30). The gain matrix L
d
k
and Lagrange multipliers Λdk satisfy the following
constraint:[
C¯k −Sk
S′k 0
] [
(Ldk)
′
(Λdk)
′
]
=
[
HkP
x¯
k|k−1
F ′k−1
]
. (46)
Note that the first equations of (41) and (46) are
obtained via solving the minimum-variance property
of the obtained filters, while the second ones are
obtained to achieve the unbiasedness requirements.
Next, we rewrite the gain matrices in (39) and
(44), respectively, as follows:
Lak = F¯k−1(S¯

)
(47)
Ldk = Fk−1(S

+
k Sk)
+S′kC¯
+

′
kC¯
+
k
×
(
I − Sk(S′kC¯+k Sk)+S′kC¯+k
)
. (48)
Defining the following notations:
Xk = C
−1/2
k S¯k, X¯k = (C¯
+
k )
1/2Sk (49)
and using the following relationship:
M+k = (M
′
kMk)
+M ′k (50)
4
Thus, using (63), (64), (66), and (67), the gain matrix
Kdk and the error covariance matrix P
d
k|k are given,
respectively, as follows:
Kdk = P
d
k|k−1S˘
′
k{S˘kP dk|k−1S˘′k + C˘k}−1 (70)
P dk|k = (I −Kdk S˘k)P dk|k−1. (71)
Next, we show how to determine the system state
estimate xˆk. Assume that x¯k|k and Vk in (3) to be
taken by the following forms:
x¯k|k = x¯k|k−1 +K x¯k (yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (72)
Vk = Uk −K x¯k S˘k (73)
where x¯k|k−1 is updated as follows:
x¯k+1|k = Akxˆk +Bkuk +Ψkdk|k. (74)
Using (1)-(3), (53)-(54), (56), and (72)-(74), we
obtain the error dynamics ek as follows:
ek = (I − LkHk)(Ak−1ek−1 + wk−1)− Lk
×(Gkwdk−1 + vk) + (Fk−1 − LkSˆk)edk−1
+(Fk−1 −Ψk−1 − Uk)dk−1|k−1 (75)
where
Lk = UkKdk +K
x¯
k (I − S˘kKdk). (76)
Using the unbiasedness constraint in (75) yields
Uk = Fk−1 −Ψk−1. (77)
Using (56), (59), (60), (62), and (77), the error
covariance matrix of (75) is described by
Pk = Lk{•}L′k + P x¯k|k−1 + F˘k−1P dk−1|k−1U ′k
−(P x¯k|k−1H ′k + F˘k−1P dk−1|k−1S˘′k)L′k
−Lk(P x¯k|k−1H ′k + F˘k−1P dk−1|k−1S˘′k)′(78)
where P x¯k|k−1 is given by (84). Finding Lk which
minimizes the trace of (78) and using (63), (66), (67),
and (73) in (76), one obtains
P x¯k|k−1H

k + F˘k−1P

k−1|k−1S˘

k

Solving (79) for K x¯k , one obtains
K x¯k = P
x¯

k . (80)
The error covariance matrix (78) corresponding to
(80) is given as follows:
Pk = (I −K x¯kHk)P x¯k|k−1 + VkP dk|kV ′k (81)
where (58), (63), and (73) are used.
Finally, the obtained OTSKF is summarized as

xˆk = x¯k|k + Vkdk|k (82)
Pk = P x¯k|k + VkP

V. THE DERIVATION OF THE PTSKF
It is known that the ARTSKF is an optimal filter
that is not affected by the values of the unknown
inputs, which is an important consideration when the
unknown-input model is highly non-Gaussian or has
unknown statistics. However, due to the limitation
of the existence condition, the ARTSKF may need
to include some information of the unknown inputs,
e.g., random-walk process, in order to enhance the
filtering performance. On the other hand, the OTSKF
can produce the global optimal system state estimates
when the unknown-input model is exactly known.
However, the OTSKF is not a robust filter and its
optimality can be compromised by a poor estimation
of the unknown inputs. In this section, we shall
derive the PTSKF, which may achieve an optimal
compromise between the ARTSKF and the OTSKF.
First, we rewrite the system (1) and (2) as
xk+1 = Akxk +Bkuk + F˜kdk + Fkdk + wk (85)
yk = Hkxk + G˜kdk + Gkdk + vk (86)
where
F˜k = Fk −Fk, G˜k = Gk − Gk (87)
in which Fk and Gk are design parameters that sig-
nify the terms Fkdk and Gkdk should be decoupled
6
Finally, summarizing the above results and using
(102) and (117)-(118), we obtain the PTSKF as
follows:
xˆk = x¯k|k + V¯kd¯k|k + V˜kd˜k|k (120)
Pk = P x¯k|k + V¯kP
d¯
k|kV¯
′
k + V˜kP
d˜
k|kV˜
′
k (121)
where x¯k|k, d¯k|k, d˜k|k, P x¯k|k, P
d¯
k|k, P
d˜
k|k, and V¯k are
given by (106), (108), (117), (107), (110), (99), and
(111), respectively, and
V˜k =
[
I 0
]
V ak
=
[
0 Fk−1
]
− (K x¯k + V¯kK d¯k)S˜k. (122)
Note that the above PTSKF can be easily rewritten
as the prescribed TSKF form (3)-(4), which is listed
as follows:
xˆk = x¯k|k + Vkdk|k (123)
Pk = P x¯k|k + VkP
d
k|kV
′
k (124)
where Vk =
[
V¯k V˜k
]
, dk|k =
[
d¯′k|k d˜
′
k|k
]′
,
and P dk|k = diag{P d¯k|k, P d˜k|k}.
VI. ON THE UNBIASEDNESS OF THE PTSKF
To facilitate the following discussions, the PTSKF
is rewritten, by using (106), (111), (108), (117), and
(120), as follows:
xˆk = (I − LkHk)x¯k|k−1 + Lkyk + (U¯k − Lk
×S¯k − V¯kK d¯k(S˘k − S¯k))d¯k−1|k−1 (125)
Lk = K x¯k + V¯kK
d¯
k + V˜kK
d˜
k . (126)
First, we show that the gain matrix Lk, given by
(126), satisfies the following constraint:
LkS˜k =
[
0 Fk−1
]
(127)
which is the unbiasedness constraint of the PMVF.
Using (98), (99), (122), and (126), we obtain
LkS˜k = (K x¯k + V¯kK
d¯
k)(C
X
k )
1/2(Mk −MkM+k
×Mk) +
[
0 Fk−1
]
M+k Mk (128)
where Mk = (CXk )
−1/2S˜k. One can easily check that
under the following condition:
rank
[
Mk[
0 Fk−1
] ] = rank [ Mk ] (129)
the constraint (127) is satisfied.
Next, we show the unbiasedness requirement of
the filter (125). Using (1)-(2), (87), (105), (112),
and (125)-(127), we obtain the error dynamics ek
as follows:
ek = (I − LkHk)(Ak−1ek−1 + wk−1)
−Lk(G˜kwdk−1 + vk)
+
(
(I − LkHk)F˜k−1 − LkG˜k)
)
edk−1
+V¯kK d¯k(S˘k − S¯k)d¯k−1|k−1
which is unbiased if V¯kK d¯k(S˘k − S¯k) =
V¯kK
d¯
k S˜k
[
I I
]′
= 0. This is always satisfied if
one has
V¯kK
d¯
k S˜k = 0. (130)
Note that the ARTSKF and the OTSKF both satisfy
the unbiasedness requirement (130), which are given
by V¯k = 0 and S˜k = 0, respectively.
VII. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
To show the proposed results, the numerical exam-
ple given by Darouach, Zasadzinski, and Boutayeb
(2003) is considered, where the parameters of system
(1) and (2) are given as follows:
Case 1:
Ak =
[
−0.0005 −0.0084
0.0517 0.8069
]
, Hk = I2×2,
Fk =
[
0.0129 0
−1.2504 0
]
, Gk =
[
0 0
0 1
]
,
Qk =
[
0.0036 0.0342
0.0342 0.3249
]
, Rk =
[
0.01 0
0 0.16
]
.
Without loss of generality, the known input uk is not
considered in this simulation case. The initial state
and its estimate are both assumed to be zero, and the
initial covariance is given by P0 = diag(10, 200).
The unknown inputs are given by
dk =
[
5us[k]− 5us[k − 20] + 5us[k − 70]
4us[k]− 4us[k − 30] + 4us[k − 65]
]
where us[k] is the unit-step function. In this
simulation example, we assume that Qdk =
diag{0.025, 0.016}, and the simulation time is 100
time steps.
As considered in Hsieh (2007b), four forms of
Fk−1 and two of Gk are chosen as follows:
F1k−1 =
[
0 0
0 0
]
, F2k−1 =
[
0 0
−1.2504 0
]
,
G1k =
[
0 0
0 0
]
, F3k−1 =
[
0.0129 0
0 0
]
,
F4k−1 =
[
0.0129 0
−1.2504 0
]
, G2k =
[
0 0
0 1
]

Robust LQ Reliable Control for Networked Control
Systems with Long Time Delays and Missing
Measurements
Chien-Shu Hsieh
Department of Electrical Engineering/Ta Hwa Institute of Technology, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.
Abstract—This paper considers the design of robust LQ reliable
control (RLQRC) for networked control systems (NCSs) whose
network-induced delay is longer than a sampling period and the
measured output may be lost. Both of the full state feedback and
ﬁlter-based output feedback controls are considered. The derived
controls may have the potentiality to tolerate control failures
and sustain parametric uncertainties. A parameterized minimum-
variance ﬁlter (PMVF) is presented for estimating the system
state and control failures when the parametric uncertainties are
modeled as unknown inputs. It is shown that the proposed RLQRC
may be seen as an extended version of the existing stochastic
optimal control.
I. INTRODUCTION
Networked control systems (NCSs) have received much
attention in the past years because of their applicability to
complex systems, such as advanced aircraft, spacecraft, and
manufacturing processes, as well as having many advantages in
practical applications, e.g., increased system ﬂexibility, beneﬁts
from sharing of the resources, low cost, and simpler installation
and maintenance [1]-[2]. However, many emerged problems of
an NCS, such as network-induced delay (sensor-to-controller
delay and controller-to-actuator delay) and missing measure-
ments (packet dropout), are needed to be solved; see, e.g., [3]-
[6] and the references therein.
One of the main issues in NCSs is network-induced delays,
which can deteriorate control system performance, and may
even cause system instability. Therefore, various approaches for
the delay issue in NCSs have been presented in the literature;
see [1] and [7]-[8]. In this paper, the considered network-
induced delay model is an extended version of the one given
in [9] as suggested by [1]. Hence, we consider the NCS whose
network-induced delay is longer than a sampling period, the
sensor is time driven, and the controller is event driven. Another
important issue in NCSs is the missing measurements problem,
which is also known as one of the major causes of deterioration
in system performance. There are many approaches to handle
this kind of problem, e.g., the stochastic system approach
[10] and the switched system approach [2]. In this paper, we
adopt the missing measurements model of [2] to use a switch
to denote the state of the sensor-to-controller channel. When
the switch is closed, the measurement output is successfully
transmitted to the controller; whereas when the switch is open,
the measurement output is held at the previous value and the
missing measurement phenomenon is happened.
System component failures may also be a critical problem
in sophisticated control system design, especially for those
high safety critical systems, e.g., aircraft and space craft.
Hence, reliable controller designs guaranteeing stability while
permitting control component failures (e.g., actuator failures
and/or sensor failures) have received great attentions in the
literature [11]-[15]. Moreover, for most practical systems, the
system model is always subject to uncertainties. In this paper,
we shall study the reliable control design problem for discrete-
time NCSs which are subject to parametric uncertainties and
actuator failures in the framework of linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) design method [16]-[18].
It is often impossible and/or impractical to get full state
information. A common approach to solve this problem is to
derive the optimal ﬁlter, e.g. the Kalman ﬁlter, to estimate the
unavailable state. This has motivated the develop of output
feedback control law. State estimation with unknown inputs or
bias has received considerable attention during the last decades.
It is known that the optimal ﬁltering for systems with unknown
inputs that have arbitrary statistics and affect both the system
model and the measurements has played a signiﬁcant role in
many applications, e.g., geophysical and environmental appli-
cations [19] and fault detection and isolation problems [20].
There are many approaches in the literature to solve this kind
of problem, e.g., the unbiased minimum-variance estimation
[19]-[23], the equivalent system description method [24], the
state estimation technique for descriptor systems [25], and the
parameterized minimum-variance ﬁltering (PMVF) [26]. In this
paper, we shall show how to apply the PMVF to solve the
considered NCS that has incurred parametric uncertainty and
control failure problems.
Putting all the aforementioned issues into consideration
has motivated this research to design the ﬁlter-based output
feedback robust LQ reliable control (RLQRC) for NCSs that
simultaneously with long time delays, missing measurements,
control failures, and parametric uncertainties. This paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, the statement of the problem
is addressed. Section III presents the design of the RLQRC
of the uncertain NCS with full state and control information.
The dedicated PMVF design for the considered NCS that has
only partial state information is presented in Section IV. Then,
the RLQRC design via output feedback is given in Section V.
Finally, simulation results are given in Section VI.

III. ROBUST LINEAR QUADRATIC RELIABLE CONTROL
DESIGN VIA STATE FEEDBACK
When the system has full state and control information, i.e.,
xak is perfectly known, using wk = 0 and (4) in (13) yields
xak+1 = (Φk + ΔΦk)x
a
k + (Γk + ΔΓk)Nku¯k. (19)
In this section, we consider the robust linear quadratic reliable
control (RLQRC), or the resilient guaranteed cost control
(RGCC), design problem (see [18] for details).
Motivated by the work of [17], the RLQRC that minimizes
cost function (18) and subjects to system (19) can be obtained
as follows:
u¯k = −
(
I + (RkaTk)
−1T¯k
)−1
S−1k
× (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/εk)D′2D1)xak (20)
where
Tk = (S−1k −Rka)−1 (21)
T¯k = diag{δ21 , δ22 , · · · , δ2m} (22)
Sk = Γ′kPk+1Γk + R¯ + (1/εk)D
′
2D2 (23)
Xk = Φ′kPk+1Φk + Q˜k − (Φ′kPk+1Γk + (1/εk)D′1D2)
× (Sk + (I − T¯k)−1(Rka)−1T¯k)−1
× (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/εk)D′2D1) , XN = Q¯0 (24)
Q˜k = Q¯1 + (1/εk)D′1D1 (25)
Pk+1 =
(
X−1k+1 − εkMM ′
)−1
> 0 (26)
in which Rka is a diagonal matrix such that 0 < Rka < S−1k and
εk > 0 satisﬁes the following relationship
I − εkM ′Xk+1M > 0. (27)
Note that if system (19) does not suffer from control failures
problem, i.e., Nk = I , then one has T¯k = 0, and hence
the RLQRC become to the following guaranteed cost control
(GCC) [16]:
uk = −S−1k (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/εk)D′2D1)xak (28)
where
Xk = Φ′kPk+1Φk + Q˜k − (Φ′kPk+1Γk + (1/εk)D′1D2)
×S−1k (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/εk)D′2D1) . (29)
Furthermore, if one considers the normal system of (19), then
the above GCC will become to the stochastic optimal state
feedback control [1], which can be rewritten as follows:
uk = −S−1k Γ′kPk+1Φkxak (30)
where
Sk = Γ′kPk+1Γk + R¯ (31)
Pk = Φ′kPk+1Φk + Q¯1
−(Φ′kPk+1Γk)S−1k (Γ′kPk+1Φk). (32)
IV. PARAMETERIZED MINIMUM-VARIANCE FILTER DESIGN
It is often impractical to get full state and control failures
information. In order to implement the proposed RLQRC, a
suitable ﬁlter that can effectively estimate the state vector and
the control failures is needed to be constructed. Using the
following notations:
zk =
[
(xbk)
′ θ′k
]′ (33)
xbk =
[
x′k u¯
′
k−h · · · u¯′k−1
]′ (34)
θk =
[
n1k · · · nmk
]′ (35)
dk =
[
Δk(D1xak + D2uk)
Δ¯kD3xak
]
(36)
Eqs. (13) and (14) can be reformulated, respectively, as follows:
zk+1 = Φ¯kzk + Γ¯ku¯k + Fdk + D¯w¯k (37)
yk = C¯zk + Gdk + vk (38)
where
Φ¯k =
[

in which nˆik is the estimate of the control failure nik. Let the
covariance matrices of w¯k and vk be given as W1 and W2,
respectively. Thus, the ﬁltering problem in this section is to
estimate xk and θk from the outputs {yt}, 0 ≤ t ≤ k (or
0 ≤ t ≤ k − 1), such that tr(E[eke′k]) is minimized, where
ek =
[
(xk − xˆk)′ (θk − θˆk)′
]′
.
It is known that the optimal linear unbiased ﬁlter for sys-
tem (37)-(38) under the assumption that the obtained ﬁlter
zˆk is not affected by the unknown inputs dk is given by
the optimal unbiased minimum-variance ﬁlter (OUMVF) [23].
However, the unbiasedness constraints in the OUMVF may
be too restricted to be applied, and hence they may result in
ﬁltering performance degradation problems. To alleviate these,
the PMVF, which is a special form of the RPMVF presented
in [26], is used in order to relax the unbiasedness constraints.
The ﬁlter form of the PMVF takes either of the following two
forms:
1) Estimator ﬁlter
zˆk = Ψkzˆk−1 + Υku¯k−1 + Lkyk + Vkdˆk−1 (39)
2) Predictor ﬁlter
zˆk = Ψkzˆk−1 + Υku¯k−1 + Kkyk−1 + Vkdˆk−1 (40)
where dˆk is a suitable chosen unbiased minimum-variance
ﬁlter of dk, and matrices Ψk, Υk, Lk, Kk, and Vk are to
where
Lk = P¯k−1C¯ ′(C¯P¯k−1C¯ ′ + W2)−1 (78)
P¯k = Φ¯kP¯k−1(I − LkC¯)′Φ¯′k + D¯W1D¯′. (79)
Using notations (12) and (74) in (77) yields
xˆk = xˆk|k−1 + L0k(yk −Hxˆk|k−1) (80)
where
xˆk+1|k = Asxˆk +
h∑
i=0
Bki uk−i (81)
L0k =
[
I 0 · · · 0 ]Lk
= Pk|k−1H ′(HPk|k−1H ′ + W2)−1 (82)
Pk+1|k =
[
I 0 · · · 0 ] P¯k [ I 0 · · · 0 ]′
= As(I − L0kH)Pk|k−1A′s + Wx (83)
in which Wx =
[
I 0
]
W1
[
I 0
]′
. Note that in deriving
(79), we have used the following relationship:
P¯k =
⎡

⎥⎥⎥⎦ (84)
which reﬂects the fact that uˆk−j = uk−j (j = 1, · · · , h) and
nˆik = 1 (i = 1, · · · ,m).
V. ROBUST LINEAR QUADRATIC RELIABLE CONTROL
DESIGN VIA OUTPUT FEEDBACK
When the system state and control failures are not accessible,
i.e., xak is not perfectly known, and considering that the mea-
surements may be lost, the RLQRC (20) should be modiﬁed
by using the estimate zˆk and the network-induced output y¯k.
To simplify the discussions, in this paper we only consider
the special case that the output y¯k only has the following two
values: yk and yk−1, which correspond to the switch conditions:
sk = 1 and (sk = 0 & sk−1 = 1), respectively.
First, assume that xˆak and xˆbk take respectively the following
forms:
xˆak =
[
xˆ′k uˆ
′
k−h · · · uˆ′k−1
]′
xˆbk =
[
xˆ′k u¯
′
k−h · · · u¯′k−1
]′
.
Then, one has
xˆak =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
I 0 · · · 0
0 Nˆk−h · · · 0
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
0 0 · · · Nˆk−1
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦ xˆbk. (85)
Second, using (44) and (57), the estimate xˆbk can be obtained
using the network-induced output y¯k as follows:
1) for switch condition: sk = 1[
xˆbk
dˆk
]
=
[
(I − K˘kC)Φ˘k−1 V˘k
−KdkCΦ˘k−1 I −KdkS

yk(86)
θˆk = θˆk−1 + V˜kdˆk−1
+Kθk(yk − CΦ˘k−1xˆbk−1 − CΓ˘k−1u¯k−1) (87)
where
V˘k =
[
I(n+h·m)×(n+h·m) 0(n+h·m)×m
]
×
(
F˜ − Lk(C¯F˜ + G˜)
)
K˘k =

]
Lk
V˜k =
[
0m×(n+h·m) Im
] (
F˜ − Lk(C¯F˜ + G˜)
)
Kθk =
[
0m×(n+h·m) Im
]
Lk
2) for switch condition: sk = 0
xˆbk = Φ˘k−1xˆ
b
k−1 + Γ˘k−1u¯k−1 + V˘kdˆk−1
+K˘k(yk−1 − CΦ˘k−1xˆbk−1) (88)
dˆk−1 = (I −Kdk−1S)dˆk−2 + Kdk−1
×(yk−1 − CΦ˘k−2xˆbk−2 − CΓ˘k−2u¯k−2) (89)
θˆk = θˆk−1 + V˜kdˆk−1 + Kθk(yk−1 − CΦ˘k−1xˆbk−1) (90)
where
V˘k =
[
I(n+h·m)×(n+h·m) 0(n+h·m)×m
]
(F˜ −KkG˜)
K˘k =
[
I(n+h·m)×(n+h·m) 0(n+h·m)×m

[
0m×(n+h·m) Im
]
(F˜ −KkG˜)
Kθk =
[
0m×(n+h·m) Im
]
Kk.
Finally, using separation theorem and the results in Section
III, the RLQRC with output feedback is implemented as
u¯k = −
(
I + (RkaTk)
−1T¯k
)−1
S−1k
× (Γ′kPk+1Φk + (1/εk)D′2D1) xˆak (91)
where 0 < Rka < S−1k and Tk, T¯k, Sk, Pk+1, εk, and xˆak are
given by (21), (22), (23), (26), (27), and (85), respectively.
VI. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
To show the proposed results, the simulation Example 1
given by [1] is extended that the obtained uncertain discrete-
time model is given as follows:
