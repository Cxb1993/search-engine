Abstract —  
A new sliding mode observer is proposed for a class of uncertain systems through sliding 
mode control theory in this paper. Based on strictly positive real concept, the stability of 
the equivalent error system is verified. Further, using the generalized matrix inverse 
approach, the proposed switching term can drive the error states to zero, and it ensures the 
global reaching condition of the sliding mode of the error system. Moreover, the presented 
sliding mode observer possesses invariance property to the uncertainty and/or external 
disturbance is proposed. Finally, an example with a series of computer simulations is 
illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed sliding mode observer.

the error system has the desired behavior once the error system states reach the switching 
surface. Secondly, a new SMO is designed such that the estimated states will approach to 
the system states. The most important is that the invariance property to uncertainties and/or 
external disturbance of the proposed SMO is ensured.  
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. System and SMO description are 
introduced in Section II. The invariance property and the discussion of stability on the 
switching surface are presented in Section III. Section IV elaborates the attractiveness to 
the switching surface. Illustrative example of the proposed SMO design and concluding 
remarks are given in Sections V and VI, respectively. Throughout the remainder of this 
paper, (M)T denotes the transpose of (M),  ||(M)|| denotes the Euclidean norm when (M) is 
a vector, or the induced norm when (M) is a matrix. Sometimes, the arguments of a 
function will be omitted in the analysis when confusion will not arise.  
 
 
II. System and Sliding Mode Observer Description  
 
Consider a class of uncertain systems modeled by the following equations    
),;,,()()()( tpuxftButAxtx                                                          (1) 
y(t) = C x(t),                                                       (2) 
where , ,  and  are the measured output, state vector, 
control input and parameter uncertainty, respectively. f(x, u, p; t) is the lumped 
uncertainty which is composed of model uncertainties and/or external disturbances. State 
matrix A, input matrix B, and output matrix C are of appropriate dimensions. And assume 
that the nominal system (A, C) is completely observable.

nR
 
Remark 1: Because (A, C) is observable, so that there exists a matrix K rnR  , such that the 
eigenvalues of the matrix  
 
A = A – KC                                                           (3) 
lie in the open left half plane.   
 
The following assumptions are made for using in the subsequent sections.   
 
Assumption 1: There exists a positive scalar valued function  for the lumped 
uncertainties f(x,u,p;t), such that  
)(tρ
 
  f(x,u,p;t) = B fm(x,u,p;t), 
)();,,( tρtpuxfm  .                                                     (4)  
III. Invariance Property and Stability of the Switching Surface  
 
e is to discuss the stability of the equivalent error 
n the error system operates on the sliding mode, the 
ollowing conditions are satisfied

ence,    
 
                                (11) 
herefore, the equivalent control Req is given as  
 Req = (FB)-1F[ A
In this section, we will show two important things. One is that the motion of the 
uncertain error trajectory on the switching surface possesses the property of insensitivity to 
the lumped uncertainty. The other on
dynamics on the switching surface.  
In studying the theory of the stability of the equivalent error dynamics on the switching 
surface, it is well known that whe

  s = 0s .
H
s= F[(A –KC) e + f – BReq] = 0.

 easily show that the equivalent error dynamic on the switching surface is 
 the form of  
 
Using (4), it can
in
 
  )(te  = Ae – B(FB)-1FAe = Ae + Bus,                                       (13)  
where, for convenient reading, we using us to denote –(FB)-1FAe.  
It is worth noting that the resulting equivalent error dynamic obtained from (13) has to 
be asymptotically stable, and the dynamic of the system in sliding mode along s = GCe is 
dominated by the triple (A, B, GC). 
Before discussing the stability of the equivalent error dynamics, a brief description for 
e SPR concept is summarized in the following [17].  
efinition: A transfer function T(q) is positive real, if  
  (14) 
t is SPR if T(q 
th

  Re[T(q)]  0  for all  Re[q]  0                                 
I –  ) is positive real for some  > 0, where q is a complex number.  
ow, let the transfer function matrix formed by the triple (A
 
N , B, GC) is as follow.  
 
T1(q) = GC(qI – A)-1B                                                   (15)  
sing the aforementioned statement, we can now establish the following Remarks.  
 
U
 
 
Theorem 1: Consider the uncertain dynamic system described in (1) and (2), and the SMO 
as modeled in (8), or the error dynamic system (9). If Assumption 1 is satisfied and the 
switching term (19) is applied to the error dynamic system, then the sliding mode and the 
ness to the sliding surface (7) will be established.  
aking the time derivative of the Lyapunov function (17), it yields

 Since the error state e contains other un-measurable state x, to avoid using un-measurable 
state, we utilize the generalized matrix inverse to overcome this problem. Hence, from (7), 
+
ying (4), (19), and the property
we have e = F s.   
BAAB   to the above equation, one gets

where )(min Q
T2
  denotes the minimum positive eigenvalue of Q. Because 1 , one can 
easily verify the negative definiteness of )(tV , that is, the sliding condition (16) is satisfied. 
As a consequence, the sliding mode and the attractiveness to the sliding surface are 
establi                                                             shed.   

error system has been demonstrated. In addition, the proposed switching term can drive the 
error states between the system states and the estimated states to zero, and it ensures that

e proposed approach is demonstrated by the theoretical proof and numerical simulation.
