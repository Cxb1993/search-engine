Abstract 
In this research report, a new approach 
that the current cells optimal switching 
sequences that have the minimum variance of 
error is presented for one-dimensional linear 
gradient error compensation in 
current-steering digital-to-analog (DAC) 
arrays. In the preliminary simulation result 
shows that the proposed method has the 
lowest variance compared to those in other 
methods. The DAC is realized in a 1P6M 
0.18-μm 1.8V CMOS process and the power 
consumption is no more than 25 mW. At this 
low power supply environment, the circuit 
still can achieve 250Ms/s and 10-bit 
resolution. 
Keywords: Digital-to-analog converter, 
DAC, current steering, switching sequences. 
 
2 . Motivations and Goals 
Nowadays, wireless communication 
systems, such as WLAN 802.11 and now 
WiMax 802.16, are growing demand for 
technologies that offer high data rates and 
low power consumption [1] . High speed and 
high precision digital-to-analog converters 
(DACs) and (analog-to-digital converters) 
ADCs have many applications in the 
different region. For example, in the wireless 
communications applications, the data 
converting rate between the digital and the 
analog is increasing. The resolution and the 
sampling speed in the high-speed application 
are the most important parameters that 
determine the system performance. Many 
works will focus on the high speed and the 
high precision data converter design in the 
future.  
It is no doubt that the high-speed and 
the high-resolution DACs are the key 
components in the data processing system. 
The DAC architectures are based on the 
voltage division, the charge redistribution, 
the current steering, and the sigma delta. 
These architectures focus on the speed, the 
resolution, the power consumption, and the 
area of layout requirements on DAC to 
estimate the trade-off among these 
requirements. In order to realize the high 
update rates and the resolutions, the proposed 
DACs employ a current steering architecture 
with partition architecture [2] . 
As mentioned above, this research 
report will focus on designing a high speed 
and high precision DAC with the low power 
consumption. The circuit can achieve the 
250Ms/s sample rate and a 10-bit resolution 
at the 1.8V supply voltage.

on Figure 5, and the three arrays will be 
surrounded by the guard ring to prevent the 
noise disturbance. Finally, the DAC is 
realized by TSMC 0.18μm CMOS process, 
and the whole chip layout is presented in 
Figure 6.  
3.4 Simulation 
The following figures are the simulation 
results, which are simulated with the Hspice 
for the proposed DAC. Figure 7 and 8 are the 
full code simulations of the proposed DAC. 
The output swing is from 0.5V to 0.5V. 
Figure 9 is the frequency domain 
performance at 250Mhz sample rate. Figure 
10 and 11 are INL and DNL errors which are 
less than 0.5 LSB. Therefore, the output is 
monotonic. Table 1, 2, and 3 are the process, 
the supply voltages, and the temperature 
variation simulations.
