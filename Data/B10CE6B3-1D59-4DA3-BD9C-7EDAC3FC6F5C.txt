A Frequency-Domain MIMO-OFDM Receiver for
Multi-Specifications Packet Accesses
I. Introduction
For most wireless broadband applications, two modulation techniques can be used: Single carrier
(SC) modulation or multi-carrier with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
OFDM is reported to the robustness in the coping with severe time dispersion effects of multipath
propagation. Also, the computationally-efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and simple
one-tape equalizer make OFDM become more and more popular in recently wireless standards.
However, the requirement of the front-end for OFDM is strict because the Peak-to-Average
Power Ratio (PAPR) and the sensitiveness in carrier frequency offset (CFO) [1]; on the other hard,
the good characteristics of friendly front-end implementation and insensitive impact on CFO are
well-known in SC modulation [2]. But conventional SC transmissions use time-domain
equalization to cope with the dominant propagation impairment of multipath. The time-domain
equalizer main consist of one or more transversal filters which introduces very high receiver
complexity in solving hard ISI problem and keeping good BER performance. Therefore, the
single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) with lower complexity of
implementation is proposed in recently years [2]-[11]. In fact, there are already many applications
of OFDM which range from digital audio and video broadcasting DAB and DVB standards [12,
13] to wireless LAN standards [14]-[16]. There are also several applications of SC modulation,
such as wireless LAN standards [15, 17] or cellular mobile communications [18]. Recently, the
design of modern receivers tends to suffice multi-standards requirement. Software Defined Radio
(SDR) [19, 20] or multi-mode receiver provides good approach in the capability of supporting
various communication systems [4]. Under this situation, how to design a high integrated receiver
to accomplish better hardware reuse becomes more and more important. A frequency-domain (FD)
SCBT receiver is a potential solution which not only increases the hardware reuse with OFDM
equalizer but also reduces the drawback of complexity implementation in time domain
equalization.
This work proposes a new FD solution to non-CP SCBT receiver without any help of IFFT
and extra CP. The proposed receiver architecture performs synchronization, equalization and data
decision in the frequency domain which can easy apply to OFDM receiver architecture. Moreover,
the GI free block transmission can significantly increase the bandwidth efficiency. But, the
non-CP limitation leads the SCBT cannot tolerate non-optimize symbol timing and suffers from
-6-
utility of performance results, even if there isn’t any CP against the fading distortions.
II. FD-OFDM Architecture
As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed receiver architecture deals with all received procedures over
frequency domains, such as packet acquisition, synchronization, equalization and demodulation.
After ADC samples at the Nyquist rate and AGC adjusts the received gain, the energy detection
(ED) takes the responsibility to detect signal coming and enable FFT operation. Once ED detects
signal coming, FFT input window will slide through the received samples one by one. FD packet
acquisition detects if packets are coming and finds the correct symbol boundary from the
frequency response of received signals in FFT input window. FD packet acquisition is composed
of packet detection (PD) and boundary detection (BD). Although ED provides the best energy
efficiency at low packet rates and can be implemented simply in analog domain or summation in
digital domain, it suffers for low detection reliability with low SNR situation. PD takes advantage
of high reliability with low SNR, but matched filters/correlators needed for PD are power hungry
and running them continually at chip rate would lead to significant energy drain. Therefore, our
strategy for low standby power schedule is described as follow: Let ED runs all the time. Once
ED detects a peak of received signal energy during FFT input window, it enables FFT and PD.
When PD detects the preamble portions of a packet, it enables BD to detect the correct symbol
boundary. To further considering the reduction of FFT computations, FFT which is enabled by
ED runs at the sliding mode until packet boundary is got. After symbol boundary is detected
successfully, FFT input window changes to a serial-to-parallel (S/P) operation. The mainly
components are parallel cross-correlation and trellis search. Parallel cross-correlation provides
the likelihood of each pattern to receive signals. The trellis search performs maximum-likelihood
sequence estimation (MLSE) algorithm to enhance the robustness of boundary detection. The
detail description of FD packet acquisition is in the following section. Frequency recovery could
be done by estimating frequency offset in frequency domain and feedback for cancellation in time
domain. Moose shows the maximum likelihood estimation for the carrier frequency offset which
is calculated in the frequency domain after taking the FFT [22]. The idea of Moose’s method uses
repeated preambles of OFDM system to estimate the carrier frequency offset. The proposed
non-CP SCBT packet format includes preambles part and are processed after FFT as well as
OFDM system. It means Moose’s method can be applied directly to the proposed receiver
architecture. The limit of the acquisition range for the carrier frequency offset is the symbol
interval of the repeated preamble. The residual frequency offset after frequency recovery causes

3-1 System Assumption
A. System Description
Indoor frequency-selective fading, e.g., IEEE and JTC, is assumed to roughly span two symbols
of L-sample preambles and M-bit block codes. The proposed packet format of non-CP SCBTs is
that datum are encoded by block code (K code sets contain M bits), modulated by QPSK and
synchronized via L-sample preambles (LM). The jth received signal can be expressed as
1 0j L j U jr H s H s n   (1)
where jr is the j
th 1L received vector, 0n is 1L complex additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) vector with variance 2n , and js is the j
th 1L transmitted symbol, e.g., preambles
single-carrier (SC) block codes, or multi-carrier datum. Both LH and UH are the lower
triangle (including diagonal entries) matrix and upper triangle matrix of channel impulse response
L Lh  , respectively.

B. Problem Statement
Linear convolution of two finite sequences is commonly conducted by extending the input
sequences with zeroes. Based on the smalest power of ≥2 times the longer of two input 
sequences, their convolution can be obtained theoretically by multiplying Fourier transforms of
input sequences with zero padding. In SISO-OFDM and MIMO-OFDM systems, the CFR can be
obtained from the FFT of the received signal divided by the FFT of the transmitted sequences.

namely preamble reconstruction. Taking all possibilities of QPSK modulations, the preambles

Table 3-1 classifies two kinds of averages in the proposed FD-CE. For method 1, LH b and UH b
are obtained for each cycle when two different cases of preambles are received and detected.
Method 2 calculates LH b and UH b until sufficient information is collected for averages,
meaning that additional preambles are needed in operations. After solving and averaging
LH b and UH b , the CFR is measured by one-tap division.

where  indicates the code set and jd is an M-bit block code. Reducing the complexity of
implementations and sharing with an MIMO-OFDM modem, an ML decision is replaced by
sphere decoder. Although CFR NˆH is estimated using linear convolution with a preamble
reconstruction, the body part and the aliasing term of each ideal code set must be separated for
decoding references. Instead of re-transforming to time domains for L jH d and 1ˆU jH s  , a
separation operator G is constructed to extract  N L j zeF H d via the linear convolution of jd

without noise enhanced; (3) an LUT to save ideal frequency responses of M-bit block codes as
decoding references; (4) a CFR buffer to save the estimated CFR; and (5) a point-to-point
multiplier (shared with FD-CE) to generate new references for sphere decoding. The key to make
the single-FFT SC-FDE work properly is the DF-AC.
Compared with MIMO-OFDM receivers, the overheads of the proposed FD-CE are the
preamble reconstruction and an LUT. In Fig. 2, with Q-bit ADC, the preamble reconstruction
mainly utilizes “addition” and “subtraction”, and the size of the LUT is about N*Q bits. For the
single-FFT SC-FDE, the additional costs are an LUT (K*M*Q bits) to store frequency responses
of M-bit block codes and the separation operator Gof DF-AC to eliminate FFT aliasing. Since
NF , G and
1
NF
 are fixed, matrix multiplications of the separation operator can be
implemented using an N*N*Q-bit LUT. As other modules, e.g., cross correlator, sphere decoder,
point-to-point multiplier and average, can be shared with an OFDM-based MIMO modem, the
additional complexity is acceptable.
3-3 Performance Evaluation
With WiFi systems and a linear block code as the evaluated references of non-CP SCBTs, the
FFT size is 64 and the number of preambles is 56—a significant amount of additional
information is available, even when method 2 is adopted for collecting two different
combinations of current and previous preambles in Eq. (4). Each preamble is spreading with
11-chip Barker code. Only one antenna is utilized to receive the non-CP SCBTs in an
MIMO-OFDM modem. The packet error rate (PER) is the performance index, that the required
PER is 8% in frequency-selective fading. The packet length is 1024 bytes, encoded by linear (8, 4)
code with BPSK modulation and complementary code keying (CCK) with QPSK modulation,
respectively. The generator matrix of a linear (8, 4) code is given by

B. Problem Statement
Despite the advantage of easy implementation in receivers, the correlation-based methods obtain
poor performance in frequency-selective fading. Low SNR also makes frame synchronizer
function difficultly. Most frame synchronizers are hard to integrate into the FD-OFDM structures
directly because they handle the TD preambles in time domain. The objective of this work is not
only to perform a robust FD frame synchronizer in low SNR and severe fading, but also to
support OFDM and non-OFDM frame synchronizations via FD-OFDM modems.

IEEE 802.11n vs. IEEE 802.11 VHT 
 IEEE 802.11n 
(MIMO OFDM) 
IEEE 802.11 VHT 
(Very High Throughput) 
Throughput 100Mbps to 600Mbps over 1Gbps 
Bandwidth 20MHz or 40MHz over 80 MHz bandwidth 
Band 2.4 GHz or 5GHz 5GHz or 60GHz or  
more higher carrier 
 
Challenges of IEEE 802.11 VHT MIMO OFDM 
1. 20 to 40 dB increased free space path loss in 60G wireless channel. 
2. Suffering from 15 up to 30 dB/km atmospheric absorption. 
3. Multipath effects are vastly reduced at 60G non-lineof-sight (NLOS) communication.  
4. Increased phase noise, limited amplifier gain, and the line modeling of the transmission. 
5. The time domain of OFDM symbol transmitted signal is observed to have large peak to 
PAPR. 
6. OFDM systems are also severely susceptible to frequency offsets culminating in higher 
design costs for synchronization. 
7. 20 dB signal power will be lost if LOS component is blocked by a person. 
 
Developing Technologies 
1. Steerable Beam Antennas: Enable 60G systems that do not rely on LOS links. 
I. Such steerable beam antennas discover the best direction to point through a searching 
algorithm of the antenna 
II. Using several antenna elements to construct a phased array with optimized radiation 
patterns
