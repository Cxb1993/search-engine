1. Introduction 
The theory for survival data has been sufficiently developed to analyze the function of risk or survival of a 
patient. The methodology is designed to determine which variables affect the form of the risk function and 
to obtain estimates of these functions for each individual. This project involves the following individuals 
until the occurrence of some event of interest. Frequently, this event does occur for some units during the 
period of observation, thus producing censured data. Another characteristic of survival data is that some 
events of interest are not terminal, events which are able to occur more than once for the same individual, 
producing the recurrent events. In fact, recurrent events pervade many studies in variety of fields, and hence 
it is of paramount importance to have appropriate models and methods of statistical analyses.  
Lifetime data where more than one event is observed on each subject arise in areas such as, 
manufacturing and industrial reliability, biomedical studies, criminology, demography, the event of primary 
interest is recurrent, so that for a given unit the event could be observed more than once during the study 
[13]. For example, several tumors may be observed for an individual; medical settings include outbreak of 
disease (e.g., encephalitis), repeated hospitalization of end-stage renal disease patients, recurrent pneumonia 
episodes arise in patients with human immunodeficiency syndrome; and angina pectoris in patients with 
chronic coronary disease. That is, the data on the i-th individual consists of the total number, im  of the 
events observed over the time period ],0( iT  and the ordered epoch of the im  event, 
iimiii Ttttt i  3210 . Additionally, we may have covariate information on each subject defined by a 
vector of censoring indicators. In more studies, interest may lie in understanding and characterizing the 
event illustrate process for individual subject or may focus on treatment comparisons based on the time to 
each distinct event, the number of events, the type of events and interdependence between events. The 
development of statistical models based on counting process data were originally introduced by Aalen (1978) 
[1]. Several methodologies have been proposed to analyze the problem of recurrent events. Lawless (1982) 
[21] apply the Poisson process to develop models that focus on the expected number of events occurred in 
determined time interval. There is an extensive literature about point process models, (e.g., Cox and Isham 
1980) [16]; this approach offers us tools powerful enough able to generalize several situations.  
In this project the problem is treated under the focus of punctual counting process. Poisson process has 
been well studied many recent discussion about lifetime and stochastic process transition data have focused 
on modeling and analyzing the effects of so called unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, the model 
presented will be studied under a Bayesian perspective. It is well known that under a Bayesian perspective 
the posterior distribution for the quantity of interest represents the most complete inference that can be made 
the respect of this quantity. The posterior distribution combines the information contained in the data with 
the prior information about on the quantity of interest. The use of the prior function that represents lack of 
prior knowledge about the quantity of interest, has been a constant in the history of the Bayesian inference. 
Key pointers to the relevant literature include Bayes (1763) [2]. Reference analysis, introduced by Bernardo 
(1979) [11] and widely developed by Berger and Bernardo [5-8] is widely considered today the most 
successful algorithm to derive non-informative prior. In this paper, reference analysis is developed for a 
survival model based on proportional intensity Poisson process, where individuals may expected to 
experience repeated events and concomitant variables are observed. This project applied Bayesian reference 
analysis to an inferential problem of recurrent cervical cancer in survival analysis. A formulation is 
considered where individuals are expected to experience repeated events, along with concomitant variables. 
In addition, the sampling distribution of the observations is modeled through a proportional intensity 
homogeneous Poisson process. This direction will give us hopefully some additional therapy strategies for 
patients with recurrent cervical cancer.

depend on the probabilistic model that is assumed to have generated the data, the idea basic is by allows the 
amount of information about an amount of interest θ, that we expect to learn how a clinical record to 
provide information regarding θ, is obviously a function of our prior knowledge regarding θ. Thus, if we 
already have a good prior knowledge of θ then we do not expect to learn much the clinical experience; on 
the other hand, if the prior knowledge regarding θ is scarce, then the data may be expected to provide a 
large amount of useful information. In other words, the bigger amount of available prior information, the 
lesser will be the quantity of information to be expected from the data. An infinitely larger clinical trial 
would eventually supply to all the information still regarding the amount of interest. Bernardo (2005) called 
this quantity missing information. Thus, it is natural to define a prior that determine no prior knowledge, or 
better, that becomes a posterior dominated for the data, as a prior that maximizes the missing information on 
the quantity of interest. However as missing information is defined as a limit that is not necessarily finite, 
the reference prior is defined as a type special of limit of a sequence of priors that maximize the expected 
information of successively having clinical trials. In this section we synthesize the formal construction 
reference priors as following [6]. 
3.1 One Parameter 
Definition 1: Consider a clinical record   which consists of one observation x from  |xp ,  . 
Let  kk xxz ,...,1 the result of k independent replications of  .  
Then, under suitable regularity conditions,  
 kX kkk dzzqzpk )(log)(exp)(                               (1) 
where  kzq |  is an asymptotic approximation to the posterior distribution  |kzp . 
The reference posterior distribution is a function  x|  such that

A reference prior   is a function which, for any data, provide the reference posterior  x|  by formal 
use of Bayes theorem, i.e., a positive function  x  such that, for all x , 
                                 

Thus the reference prior    is the limit of the sequence   ,...2,1, kk   defined by (1) in the precise 
sense that the information-type limit of the corresponding sequence of posterior distributions   ,...2,1,| kxk   is the posterior obtained from    by formal use of Bayes theorem.  
 Proposition 1: (Reference priors under asymptotic normality).  
Let   xxp ,| , be a probability model with one real-valued parameter  . If the asymptotic 
posterior distribution of   given k replications of the clinical record is normal, with standard deviation

4. Model Formulation 
Suppose that n  individuals may experience a single type of recurrent event. Let im  denote the number of 
events occurring for the i-th individual. Assume that the i-th individual is observed over the interval  iT,0 , 
where 
iT  is determined independently of im . Let iimii Tttt i  ...0 21  where the variable of interest ijt  
denote the continuous failure times for the i-th individual and the j-th occurrence events ( ni ,...,1  and 
imj ,...,1 ). Besides that we are going to consider that individual carry a covariate vector represented by x, so 
data from i-th individual consist of the total number of events im observed about a time period  iT,0  in the 
ordered occurrence, 
iimi
tt ,...,1 and the covariate vector x. It is assumed that the repeated events of an 
individual with 1k  covariate vector x occur according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with 
intensity function given by 
    )exp()()( '0  ix xtti  , 0t , i = 1,2,…,n                                             (4) 
where  t0  is a baseline intensity function and ),...,,( 21 ikiii xxxx   and k ,...,1  is a vector of unknown 
parameters. The corresponding cumulative or integrated intensity function is 
                             t xxx etduut 0 '0 )()()(                                     (5) 
where     t duut 0 00  . 
Methods of analysis will be considered semi parametric if )(0 t  is arbitrary, and completely parametric if 
)(0 t  is specified by a parameter vector  . In the case of the function of baseline hazard to be constant, this 
is a homogeneous Poisson process (see Cox and Isham, 1980). The Poisson process model (4) is often 
known as Cox proportional risk model (see, Cox, 1972). Considers a parametric Poisson process where 
);()( 00  tt  . Then, the likelihood function for the model (4) for   and   is given by (see, Cox and 
Lewis 1996),

5. Reference Analysis for Survival Model Parameters 
Following the methodology described in section 3, now we derive the reference prior considering two 
potential groups (with surgically hysterectomy or not), which corresponds to the ordered partition },{ v , 
where },...,,{ 21 k   and v  is considered to be the quantity of interest (to see Berger and Bernardo, 
1992b). Hence the joint posterior distribution of the parameter is often asymptotically normal (see e.g., 
Bernardo and Smith, 1994. Sec.5.3). In this case, the reference prior is easily derived and reference prior 
only depends on Fisher information matrix found in (11). So the reference prior relative to this ordered 
parametrization is of the following form )()|(),( vvv   . From Corollary of Proposition 3 where the 
nuisance parameter space  )(  is independent of v , it is easy to see that

7. Conclusion   
In this project, we have summarized definition and derivation of reference posterior and illustrated the theory 
with an important example in survival analysis and we have mentioned some results which may be used to 
substantiate the claim that they constitute the more promissing avaliable method to derive non-subjective prior 
distributions. The same technique can be developed for other parameter of interest in the model. In simulation 
studies we know the true value of the parameter and so we can compare the approaches to see which one is 
more accurate in estimating the parameters of the model.   In this problem, we observe that the obtained 
marginal reference posterior distribution showed to be adequate for estimating the parameter of interest. 
Response to therapy did not differ in both examined groups in this study. In our study we confirmed that the 
lack of response to initial therapy, whatever treatment scheme was used, depended on clinical stage of cervical 
cancer, which appeared to be the main prognostic factor.

combines the information contained in the data with the prior 
information about on the quantity of interest. The use of the 
prior function that represents lack of prior knowledge about 
the quantity of interest, has been a constant in the history of 
the Bayesian inference. Key pointers to the relevant literature 
include Bayes (1763), Laplace (1812). Reference analysis, 
introduced by Bernardo (1979) and widely developed by 
Berger and Bernardo [5-8] is widely considered today the 
most successful algorithm to derive non-informative prior. In 
this project, reference analysis is developed for a survival 
model based on proportional intensity Poisson process, where 
individuals may expected to experience repeated events and 
concomitant variables are observed. The methodology is 
illustrated using the recurrent cervical carcinoma data which 
medical records and pathology were reviewed for all patients 
accessible by the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital

by the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital Medical 
Institutional Review Board.  
Section 2 presents a review of research problem relevant to 
the study. Section 3 contains an overview of reference 
analysis, where the definition is motivated, heuristic 
derivations of explicit expressions for the one parameter, two 
parameters, and multi-parameter cases are sequentially 
presented. In Section 4 we describe the survival model. In 
Section 5, the theory is applied to an inference problem, the 
parameters survival model, for which no objective Bayesian 
analysis has been previously proposed. Some work items and 
expected contributions are presented in Section 6. 
II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
Cervical carcinoma remains one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related death among women globally [19, 24]. Even 
though the morbidity and the mortality have been decreasing 
in recent years, the morbidity rates of Cervical Carcinoma are 
the second leading type in women and the mortality rates are 
the sixth of the top ten cancers in Taiwan. The cure rate of 
cervical carcinoma is quite high if detected early, but 
approximately 30% of International Federation of Gynecology 
and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB2 to stage IV disease will 
ultimately recur with modern multimodality treatment [20, 28]. 
Once the primary treatment has failed, the opportunity of 
secondary cure is slim. Probably several factors exist which 
indeed affect the ultimate prognosis of early stage cervical 
carcinoma other than clinical staging. In other words, early 
detection of recurrence may impact survival. Moreover, 
detection of asymptomatic recurrences is associated with 
prolonged overall survival and survival from the time of initial 
detection of recurrence [12]. Therefore, this paper attempts to 
improve surveillance after treatment might lead to earlier 
detection of relapse, and precise assessment of recurrent status 
could improve outcome. 
In Taiwan, cervical carcinoma is the second most common 
malignancy for women and contributing to a quarter of all 
female cancer cases. It remains one of the most pressing 
medical problems for women. The natural history of cervical 
carcinoma begins with a normal epithelium which progress 
through various stages of dysplasia - cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia grade CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3 - and finally, to invasive 
cervical carcinoma (ICC). There is a long time interval for the 
progression to ICC, and consensus on the fact that regression 
occurs in CIN. The most important part of therapy is to detect 
and eradicate local CIN 3 lesions before the progression to 
ICC and metastasis can occur. In general, the Papanicolaou 
(Pap) smear has been used widely as the most effective 
screening tool for detecting precancerous cervical lesions. 
Though screening and treat in its early phase, cervical 
carcinoma will be decreased significantly to its rate of 
incidence as well as death. Because cervical carcinoma is a 
cancer which can be controlled and avoided, the studies 
related to the causes of and the treatment to the cervical 
carcinoma has been described sufficiently in lots of advanced 
researches. On the other hand, there are few researches on its 
relationship between recurrent events and the mortality and 
incidence rate. Indeed, recurrent cervical carcinoma is a 
devastating disease for those women unfortunate enough to 
suffer such an event. Patients with recurrent disease or pelvic 
metastases have a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate 
between 15 and 20% [4]. Since, the treatment of recurrent 
cervical carcinoma is still a clinical challenge. When the 
recurrence is not surgically resectable, and/or suitable for 
curative radiation, therapeutic options are limited. In some 
advanced countries, the combination of cisplatin and 
topotecan is preferred since this is the only regimen which 
was able to show a statistical significant improvement of 
overall survival (OS) (9.4 months) without impairing quality 
of life due to intolerable toxicity [22]. But one has to be 
careful, because due to a change in primary therapy since 
1999, when concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
became standard [23, 25-27], and due to the current 
investigation of the role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy 
(EORTC 55994 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
2004)), most people with recurrent cervical carcinoma will 
have had some challenge with a chemotherapeutic agent. This 
will influence responses in secondary treatment lines and will 
limit comparison of new studies with older ones including 
more chemonaive patients. Therefore, in the absence of 
surgical/ radiotherapeutic indications, chemotherapy should be 
targeted to the prolongation of survival with minimum 
morbidity and to the improvement of subjective symptoms, 
thus preserving quality of life. Unfortunately, in these 
conditions, there is no evidence of a significant impact on 
survival or on quality of life. For these reasons, the role of 
chemotherapy in recurrent disease remains to be defined and 
the search for more active and less toxic agents must be 
continued. 
However, the question remains: What is the rate of 
progression, regression, and/or stasis from one stage to 
another? What is the time interval in which these changes are 
detected? At stake is the considerable financial cost and cost-
effectiveness of implementation; in other words, the rate of 
progression for all the stages of dysplasia from normal to ICC 
must be established and the frequency of progression for the

C.  The Multiparameter Case 
The approach to the nuisance parameter are considered 
above was based on the use of an ordered parametrization 
whose first and second components were   , , respectively, 
referred as the parameter of interest and the nuisance 
parameter. The reference prior for the ordered parametrization   , , was then successively constructed to obtain 
      |,  . 
When the model parameter vector   has more than two 
components, this sequential conditioning idea can obviously 
be extended by considering as an ordered parametrization,  m ,...,1 , and generating, by successive conditioning, a 
reference prior, relative to this ordered parametrization, of the 
form

Interval estimates and hypothesis tests for the parameters 
can be performed, in principle, by considering the asymptotic 
normal distribution of the maximum likelihood estimates and 
the asymptotic chi-squared distribution of the likelihood ratio 
statistics, respectively. 
B. The Matrix of Information of Fisher Associated with the 
Model 
The posterior distribution of the parameter is often 
asymptotically normal (see e.g., Bernardo and Smith, 1994, 
Sec.5.3). In this case, the reference prior is easily derived. If 
the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal, than 
reference prior only depends on Fisher information matrix. 
Considering the log of the likelihood function (10) we have 
the first and second derivatives given by

V. REFERENCE ANALYSIS FOR SURVIVAL MODEL 
PARAMETERS 
Following the methodology described in section 3, now we 
derive the reference prior considering two potential groups 
(with surgically hysterectomy or not), which corresponds to 
the ordered partition },{ v , where },...,,{ 21 k   and v  
is considered to be the quantity of interest (to see Berger and 
Bernardo, 1992b). Hence the joint posterior distribution of the 
parameter is often asymptotically normal (see e.g., Bernardo 
and Smith, 1994. Sec.5.3). In this case, the reference prior is 
easily derived and reference prior only depends on Fisher 
information matrix found in (11). 
So the reference prior relative to this ordered parametrization 
is of the following form )()|(),( vvv   . From 
Corollary of Proposition 3 where the nuisance parameter 
space  )(  is independent of v , it is easy to see that
