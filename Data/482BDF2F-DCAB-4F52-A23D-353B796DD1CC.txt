Abstract 
 
This is the complete report for the progress of the third-year and the final results of this 
three-year project. IC design and measurement of both a 8-bit 250MHz Nyquist-rate A/D 
converter and a 14-bit 200MHz Nyquist-rate D/A converter will be accomplished in this 3-year 
project. The performance of the ADC and DAC, which can be used as IPs in 
System-on-chip(SoC) of wideband communication systems is superior to those of the literatures 
which have been published so far. In the third year, high-speed high-resolution Nyquist-rate 
ADC and DAC are implemented. 
Flash structure is adopted for the ADC to achieve 250MHz sampling frequency. Among 
the high-speed and high-resolution ADC, averaging and reinterpolation techniques are utilized 
in ADC to reduce the static error caused by element mismatches and the dynamic error when 
signal is switching for the achievement of 8-bit resolution. This project proposed a new 
auto-zeroing with averaging and reinterpolation to reduce static and dynamic errors containing a 
new switching preamplifier to avoid the use of non-overlap control signals required by 
conventional auto-zeroing and to eliminate the interference caused by the high-speed 
auto-zeroing operation at input nodes. The design ADC had been fabricated and measured. The 
total area is 1.33mm x 1.057mm. It consumes 180mW. 
Current steering structure is used for the DAC to fit the high-speed requirement because it 
can drive a resistive load directly without high-speed amplifier. Therefore, current steering 
structure has more potential for high-speed application than other structures. In order to reduce 
the error caused by element mismatched of current sources, a new calibration algorithm is 
proposed. Furthermore, a fixed-period return-to-zero method is adopted to solve the problem of 
nonlinear transient output and both improve the static and dynamic linearity. The design DAC 
had been fabricated and measured. The total area is 1.07mm x 1.07mm. It consumes 43mW.

Introduction 
 
 
 
 
 The proliferation of digital computing and signal processing in electronic systems is 
often described as “the world is becoming more digital every day.” Compared with analog 
circuits, digital circuits exhibit lower sensitivity to noise and more robustness to supply and 
process variations and offer more extensive programmability. In particular, scaling properties 
of very large scale integration (VLSI) processes have allowed digital processors to attain 
higher speed. In order to interface digital processors with the analog world, a high-speed 
analog-to-digital converter and a high-speed digital-to-analog converter are needed. 
 
 
1.1 Motivation 
 
With the continuous advance of semiconductor technology and scaling of devices, digital 
circuits have achieved both high speed and low power dissipation. However, to keep this trend 
sustainable on mixed-signal integrated circuits(ICs), the ADCs must be implemented in 
mainstream CMOS technology and comply with scaling-down power voltage, which pose a 
serious challenge to mixed-signal integrated circuit design. Therefore, ADCs often appear as 
bottleneck in high-performance mixed-signal system. The goal of this research on high-speed 
A/D converter is to develop new A/D conversion techniques, which lead to low cost, 
moderate power and high speed in CMOS technology. The continuous operation of an 8-bit 
Nyquist-rate ADC is required at the conversion rate up to 200MHz. Therefore the A/D 
converter must operate high speed and demand low or moderate accuracy, the flash 
architecture is used to implement the A/D converter. In order to solve random offset error 
caused by process variation, which is the main problem of flash-type ADCs, averaging or 
autozeroing techniques is needed for this ADC. But, the high expense must be paid for the use 
of these techniques presently. Therefore the thesis proposes several techniques for the flash 
ADC to solve the problems and achieve the required target. 
 For high-speed D/A conversion, the current-steering DACs are often used, since they can 
drive an output resistive load directly without requiring the use of an extra buffer. However, 
the static linearity of current-steering DACs is sensitive to current-source mismatch. Not only 
the current-source mismatch in process variation, but also the glitch effect limits the dynamic 
performance. In this report, a new calibration structure to improve the matching accuracy of 
the current sources will be proposed. Because of the lower matching requirement of the 
current sources, the chip area is smaller and the cost is lower, too. Besides, we propose a 
novel return-to-zero scheme to eliminate the glitch effect without losing too much power of 
output signal. 
 
 
 
 
1.2 Organization 
 
The organization of this report is described as follows. First of all, some introductions 
and the motivation of this project are presented in chapter 1.

In the chapter, we introduce the existing techniques applied for the flash ADC. Fist, we 
describe the concepts of the existing techniques and their problems to implement the 
high-speed flash ADC. The common techniques like the autozeroing, averaging [1] [2], 
interpolation [1], reinterpolation techniques are included in the descriptions. Next, we 
incorporate the new techniques to solve the met obstacles for the designed ADC target. Of 
course, the verification of these techniques are also done for the practicability by themselves. 
 
2.1 Averaging Technique     
 
In CMOS flash ADC, random offsets in the comparators, which are often considerably 
large than the least significant bit (LSB), limit the achievable linearity to 6bit. The random 
offsets can be suppressed by increasing the size of the comparators, but at the expense of 
power consumption and capacitance. Thus the averaging technique is proposed [2] to solve 
the random offset problem. The idea is insert lateral resistors between output nodes of 
adjacent repetitive cells to reduce the random offset of each cell since the different 
impendence seen by the random offset currents and the signal currents as Fig2.1. In other 
words, this technique lets the each cell output be contributed by its neighbors and itself cell, 
thus the random offset also be averaged by its neighbors and itself cell. In fact, the lower 
value of the lateral resistor leads to greater improvement in random offset. From the Fig2.1, 
the inserting resistors decrease the gain of the preamplifiers because it lowers the output 
impendence so that at some time it will increase the dynamic random offset of the 
regenerative latch as referred to the total input offset. Thus, the inserting resistor value and the 
preamplifier’s gain need be carefully considerate for our designing random offset suppression. 
However, the gain-bandwidth trade-off limit the preamplifier’s benefit; that is, the higher the 
preamplifier’ gain, the lower its bandwidth (BW), thus lower the ADC’s conversion rate. 
However, the averaging technique can increase bandwidth since the output impendence 
decrease so that it is suitable for the high-speed ADC architecture.

The impulse response in Eq.(2.5) is plotted in Fig 2.3, where n is the node position along the

offset averaging. R1/R0 ration or b in Eq. (2.5) defines the impulse width and therefore 
available averaging range. Figure 2.4 shows relationship between b and R1/R0 ration. 
Reduction in R1/R0 ration increases the impulse width. Conceptually, smaller R1/R0 ration 
introduces more interaction from the adjacent node to the node of interest, and this increase in 
interaction widens the spatial filter bandwidth.

averaging network. When the averaging network is applied to an array of differential 
amplifiers, the uncorrelated random offset currents from the nearby differential amplifier 
within the “averaging region” are collected to the zero-crossing node by the impulse response 
of the resistive averaging network. The averaging of the collected random offset currents 
results in reduced net offset current at the zero-crossing node, and the input-referred offset is 
also reduced by a factor described as Error Correction Fact (ECF), shown as the dark shaded 
region in Fig. 2.6.

2.1.3 Mathematical Derivation of Averaging Network 
 
Averaging network influences both the random distribution of the offset voltage and 
transconductance (gm) of the amplifiers in an array connected to the network. 
Transconductance can be reduced by the network to work against the input-referred offset 
reduction. Because the input-referred offset is determined by the zero-crossing distribution on 
the x-axis (Fig. 2.6), both reduction in gm and random offset distribution counteracts so both 
should be considered to calculate the net impact of the averaging network on the 
input-referred offset distribution. 
The input-referred offset reduction with the averaging network is described as the ratio 
of gm reduction (before and after averaging) to the random offset distribution reduction 
(before and after averaging) and defined as the error correction fact (ECF) in Eq. 2.8.

The ratio of gs to gn (ECF) results in input-referred random offset reduction, as shown in 
Fig. 2.8. Assuming no tail-current mismatch (Nn=L), random offset reduction by the square 
root law can be observed when R1/R0 ratio becomes zero. The maximum achievable random 
offset reduction of averaging network with given amplifier transition region is expressed as

σσ −− = +                   (2.24) 
and the value matches with the offset reduction factor with R1/R0 of zero in Eq. (2.22). Offset 
averaging is limited by the amplifier tail-current mismatch and reduces the offset reduction, 
shown as gray lines (Nn=∞) in Fig. 2.8. 
      The resistive averaging network lowers the input-referred random offset by reshaping 
and narrowing the offset’s distribution curve, but improper termination at the network 
boundaries may introduce systematic offset. An averaging termination circuit has been 
designed to resemble the infinite string of resistors and amplifiers. By applying termination to 
the averaging network, the amount of overrange amplifiers and, therefore, the power 
consumption is reduced, while the linearity and speed performance are maintained.

of the preamplifier. Since Hn is highpass function, the low-frequency component of Vn are 
suppressed by this operation. So, dc offset voltage and much of the input-referred flick noise 
will be eliminated. Therefore, the basic operation described above is called autozeroing offset 
cancellation technique. 
 
2.2.2 Autozeroing Topology 
 
In generally, the basic autozeroing technique can be categorized into two types [4]: Input 
Offset Storage (IOS) and Output Offset Storage (OOS). This former technique (IOS) 
measures the input offset of the preamplifier by closing a unity-gain feedback loop around it 
and stores the resulting offset on capacitors in series with the input. Fig 2.10 depicts a 
configuration employing this technique. However, this latter technique (OOS) measures the 
output-referred offset of the preamplifier by grounding its inputs and stores the result on 
capacitors in series with the preamplifier output. Fig 2.11 depicts a configuration employing 
this technique. From Fig2.10 and Fig 2.11, the total input-referred offset of the two types can 
equalized as:

2.2.3 Modified Autozeroing  
 
The autozeroing technique is a effective resolution to reduce the random offset caused by 
the MOS device. However, there are many critical problems by using this technique as shown 
by : 
1. Non-overlap autozeroing control clock is difficult to provide with the increasing 
conversion rate. 
2. Autozeroing period shorten with the conversion rate, which leads to recovery fast hard 
3. Interference caused by the high-speed autozeroing operation is serios on the input nodes 
of preamplifier (IOS) 
4. The requirement of reference ladder resistance depends on conversion rate 
5. Power supply noise is caused by the large difference of power supply current between 
autozeroing and comparison. 
6. The value of capacitance using in the autozeroing technique is usually large caused by 
charge injection, and attenuation considerations.  
Since the above problems are by autozeroing technique, several modified autozeroing 
skills are provided to solve these problems. First, the direct way is to extend autozeroing 
period and shorten the transition between autozeroing and comparison is led to overcome the 
mentioned problems. Thus Fig 2.13 illustrated the operation action with the timing diagram.

generator and more areas than the original way. Thus, it is not a effective way to implement 
the high-speed flash ADC. However, the latter is it primarily uses the interpolation technique 
to replace the autozeroing comparator for the corresponded output signal generation, as 
shown in Fig2.14(b). However, this skill also needs a complex timing-control generator (the 
extra cost) and it is hard to operating at high-speed flash ADC since the large numbers of 
interpolating resistors are needed in this skill. So if the timing-control requirement has been 
relaxed, the autozeroing technique is most effective way to reduce offset problems of flash 
ADC, and can operate at the high-speed conversion.      
 
2.3 Interpolation Technique 
 
One of the critical disadvantage of the flash architecture is the large input capacitance. 
This problem can be alleviated by applying interpolation technique as shown in Fig2.15. The 
idea is that if Vin crosses , then crosses zero, increasing the resolution by a 
factor of two. In essence, interpolation adds zero crossings to the set of input/output 
characteristics of flash stage.

2.3.1 Interpolation Type 
 
In general, there are three basic types to implement the interpolation techniques. They 
are voltage interpolation, current interpolation, and active interpolation as well as the 
respective description are as follows.  
A widely used interpolation type is called voltage interpolation, which interpolates by 
using resistor and transmission gate network [9]. Fig2.16 illustrated the diagram. In the kind 
of interpolation, output signals of the pramplifiers are generated by linear preamplifiers with 
finite gain, and then interpolation signal is added by adjacent preamplifier output. Thus the 
linear portion of the two interpolating preamplifiers must extend enough large to keep off 
interpolated errors. Note that the interpolated zerocrossing point’s location of the 2x 
interpolation can’t be affected by the nonlinearity due to the gain curves used by the 
interpolation identical and odd 
symmetry.

When the interpolation signal is the form of current, this interpolation is called current 
interpolation.Fig 2.17 illustrated this technique.

2.4 Reinterpolation Technique 
 
As mentioned in above sections, an important benefit of interpolation is the reduction of 
the differential nonlinearity resulting from the offset of the preamplifiers [10]. 
However, the integral nonlinearity still remains uncorrected, demanding large input 
preamplifier device. To solving the problem, a “ reinterpolation” technique is introduced [11]. 
As depicted in Fig 2.18, the original output  from the preamplifiers are fed into 
another bank of interpolation preamplifiers to generate a second set of interpolated 
outputs ( ' , which though different from  contain Sufficient information to represent 
the original analog input signal. If the random offset voltage of the adjacent  are 
uncorrelated, the standard deviation of the random offset voltage of the corresponding  
is reduced by a factor of the square root of 2. As depicted in Fig 2.19,

defined as the maximum random offset error of the zerocrossing of  or  
respectively. If only the interpolated zerocrossing ,are sensed by the following stages 
and the original zerocrossing  are discared, then the overall INL is reduced by 
approximately 30%. The reduction of the INL translates into a higher tolerance of random 
offset voltage in the preamplifiers, allowing “smaller input devices” of the preamplifiers and a 
“two-fold reduction” in the capacitance seen by the T/H circuit driving the preamplifiers.

2.5 Proposed New Autozeroing with Reinterpolation and 
Capacitor Averaging  
 
Since the trend of high-speed conversion and moderate resolution(6-8 bit) at low voltage 
in the ADC implement, the flash ADC consisting of chopper comparators is commonly the 
best choice to meet the object and no operational amplifiers can be employed in the design. 
But, it has the disadvantage of large power consumption and high input capacitance as the 
number of comparators increases exponentially with the resolution specification. However, 
the random offset problem of comparators and a large number of comparator are always 
bottlenecks to practice the high-speed flash ADC. From the above discussion technique, the 
autozeroing technique is the most effective way to solve the offset problems in the flash ADC. 
But, it has critical problems at high-speed autozeroing operation, which is the same as 
conventional autozeroing operation. Fig 2.20 shows a conventional autozeroing diagram to 
explain the problems of the used autozeroing techniques. In the diagram, while the 
autozeroing period shortens with the increasing conversion rate, the required

non-overlap clock control timing is more and more difficult to be produced and the 
interference to comparator input becomes urgently serious during autozeroing operation mode 
which the induced ripple voltage from the interference settle to zero 
eventually, but they considerably limit the maximum conversion speed of the flash ADC. Here, 
it is noted that low latency and continuous input conversion are required for the discussion 
except the high sampling rate; otherwise application of the flash ADC will be limited. As to 
background autozeroing enables continuous conversion, but requires complex clocking that is 
incompatible with high-speed operation [7][8].            
Because in flash ADC architecture, it has the problem that input capacitance and area of 
the used input preamplifiers are large with high-speed operation. From the above discussion 
technique, the reinterpolation and averaging techniques are the most effective way to reduce 
the area and input capacitance of the used input preamplifiers practice the high-speed flash 
ADC. Therefore, combined the above discussion , we propose a new technique which is 
called “New Autozeroing with Renterpolation and Capacitor Averaging” to overcome the 
mentioned drawbacks.

Beside, the non-overlap clock controls have no need in the switching preamplifier if the 
loop switches(CLK) of the following preamplifier are off before the switch (CLKL) is off. 
The switching preamplifier operates at two phase. At autozeroing phase as Fig 2.23, the 
switch CLKL models a resistor R0, so the switching preamplifier *( 1 0 / 2)gain gm R R=   and 
at the input signal of the following preamplifier is reset to . At Amplify phase as Fig 2.24, 
the switching preamplifier , so at the input signal of the following preamplifier 
becomes .Where gm is the transconductance of the 
switching preamplifier. So, we proposed new technique “New Autozeroing with 
Reinterpolation and Capacitor Averaging” with switching preamplifier that can work at 
high-speed, low-latency and continuous data conversion. However, “New Autozeroing with 
Reinterpolation and Capacitor Averaging” with the switching preamplifier also has a 
advantage that the random offset of the switching preamplifier can be reduced without 
increasing transistor size by Reinterpolation and Capacitor Averaging techniques. Therefore, 
the area and input capacitance of the switching preamplifiers can be reduced to practice the 
high-speed flash ADC and this will be explained by this following treatments.

Circuit Design of ADC 
 
 
 
 
In the chapter, we proposed the flash architecture is introduced at first. Therefore, the 
building blocks and the circuit design of the flash ADC are discussed. The required resolution 
is 8-bit, targeting to the conversion rate at 250MS/s.  
 
3.1 Proposed the Flash ADC Architecture 
 
First of all, the architecture with proposed skills of the flash ADC is shown as Fig3.1 and it 
mainly based on “New Autozeroing with Reinterpolation and Capacitor Averaging” technique 
and interpolation technique to construct the ADC. The flash ADC is preceded by an on-chip 
track and hold. The switching preamplifier put in font of the sampling capacitor not only solve 
the problems of the conventional autozeroing as mentioned, and by using reinterpolation and 
capacitor averaging also reduce the area and offset of the switching preamplifier. This is 
important since it can reduce the large input capacitances and power consumption for the flash 
ADC. The feedback loop is connected at two cascaded differential preamplifiers, one is high 
gain and another is high swing for operation low voltage supply. Besides, 2x interpolation is 
adopted at the third preamplifier and 4x interpolation is adopted at the input of the latch for 
reducing the number of preamplifiers, power, and area. The outputs of the comparator are 
buffered with an extra circuit [15], and it can reduce metastability. However, the outputs of 
extra circuit are applied to the error correction circuit. The thermometer code produced by the 
comparators is processed by the digital error correction logic before the thermometer-to-binary 
conversion is done by a precharged ROM with optimized pull-down transistors. The ROM 
outputs are held for a whole clock period with a high-speed true single phase clocked (TSPC) 
flip-flop and are brought off-chip by output buffers

3.2 Front-end Track-and-hold Circuit 
 
Due to the usage of the front-end T/H, the distributed skew problem is alleviated. 
However, the setting behavior of the front-end T/H thus determines the dynamic performance 
of the whole ADC. Therefore, we adopted the time-interleaved T/H [12] to solve the problem, 
and the implementation of the T/H circuit is shown in Fig3.2, which is a pseudo-differential 
type to cancel the second harmonic.

The interleaved T/H has several advantages. First, the acquisition time available for each 
T/H is twice that which would be available if a single T/H circuit was used. This makes the 
design of the T/H circuit more manageable. A second important advantage of interleaving T/H 
 33
circuit” to solve the problem. As shown in Fig3.2 “dummy capacitor cancel circuit”, the 
operation action is through “dummy capacitor cancel circuit” sampled the another differential 
T/H circuit vgn value stored at vgtt node. Because vgp and vgn is differential mode, thus vgp 
and vgn is mixed at next period through “dummy capacitor cancel circuit” and it will become 
common voltage at vgp and vgn node. So at same moment the next differential sample value 
is also stored at vgp and vgn node, thus the common voltage and the next differential sample 
value store at vgp and vgn node. Because the T/H circuit is differential mode, the common 
voltage is canceled. Therefore, through “dummy capacitor cancel circuit” can solve the 
second disadvantage.   
The design of the interleaved T/H circuit is under the 1.8V supply voltage. However, to 
meet the settling requirement, the bias current of the main source follower used to drive the 
input loading of the comparators must be large enough. Consider the application of a small 
step input, in order to reach the required value, the bias current needs to charge the input 
loading of the comparators quickly. The condition set the lower bound of the slew rate as 
/ 2

Where the I, , LC stepV , and sT  are the bias current of the main source follower, the input 
loading of the comparators, the input step magnitude, and sampling period.     
The limited headroom and high driving requirement of it makes a tradeoff between power 
consumption and dynamic performance. Shown in the Fig3.4 is the post-layout simulation 
result of the T/H alone with input loading of the comparators when acquiring input of a 
40.0390625MHz full-scale sine-wave at 250MS/s.However, the SNDR performance is 55dB.

3.3.4 Preamp3 Circuit 
 
Because 4x interpolation technique is used in the preamp3 circuit, the linearity of the 
preamp3 circuit does be cared very much. Thus the PMOS load is applied for the preamp3 
circuit to have better linearity. However, the interpolation technique has a main problem that 
the ADC speed will be decrease by a large RC time constant due to large impendence at the 
interpolation node. Because the large impendence is generated by large interpolation 
impendence for the requirement of enough interpolation signals to overcome noise and offset 
errors. However, the interpolation impendence can also lower the gain of the preamp3 circuit 
that it needs large interpolation impendence to maintain desired gain to overcome offset. 
Hence it has becomes a quite large problem to implement a high-speed flash ADC with the 
interpolation approach. In order to solve the problem, it adopted the circuit [16] as shown in 
Fig3.8. Because it has a high output impendence that it is effective for inserting the

clock signal goes down, transistor 15 16M M−  still works as a cascade transistor, resulting a 
high impendence, but as soon as transistor 15 16M M−  is switched off completely, the 
impendence becomes infinite and reduce kickback. Therefore, the    
reset time constant can be approximately by

enough to cause a relatively large initial voltage imbalance in two regenerative nodes x and y. 
During the regenerative phase (CLK clock is low), the injection of the current imbalance 
stops, and the conductance of the switch 5M  drops to zero. The regeneration speed is 
governed by a positive pole approximately 
given by [16],[17].

Note that both the NMOS and PMOS regeneration loops contribute with 
transconductance and with parasitic capacitance to the definition of this pole. If the size of the 
PMOS regenerative loop relatively large compared with the size of the NMOS regenerative 
loop, the regenerative speed is strongly reduced because of the following reasons. First, the 
PMOS transistors add too much capacitance to the regenerative nodes and add a limited 
transconductance. Second, the threshold voltage of the latch moves toward VDD, leading to a 
higher overdrive voltage of the NMOS transistors and, consequently, to a lower 
transconductance (for the same current budget)   Consequently, in order to improve the 
regeneration speed the ration between the size of the PMOS regeneration transistors and the 
NMOS regeneration transistors should smaller than the ration between the carrier mobility of 
the NMOS and PMOS transistors. In the design, the transistor sizes have been scaled so that 
both the transconductance and the capacitances associated with the top and bottom 
regeneration loops are about equal. Another important aspect is the ability to recover from a

Fig 3.11 comparison between (a) a Gray encoded ROM and (b) a binary encoded ROM when a 
metastable state of the comparator occurs. 
 
In the presence of a small input signal, a low regeneration gain might be insufficient to amplify 
the input voltage to a valid logic level, increasing in this way the probabilities of having an 
error. In short, the metastability error probability (and the number of errors 
per unit of time) is inversely proportional to the regenerative gain. Since the error rates increase 
exponentially with the acquisition frequencies, the meatastability errors might increase by 
orders of magnitude for very high-speed converters. On the other hand, the error rates are 
exponentially proportional to the regenerative time constant. Therefore, the most effective way 
of reducing the metastability error rates is to reduce the regenerative time constant, that is, to 
increase the positive regenerative pole as described before. Although this provides an efficient 
way of reducing the error rates, other approaches have been used to reduce the metastability 
errors even further and to make the converter degrade gracefully in the presence of an error. 
One possible approach consists introducing pipelined latches immediately after the comparators 
 43
selected, and there is no problem. Finally, if the one pf outputs of the circuit is settling to zero 
when the ROM is clocked(the other output is a valid one), then one ROM line is selected, and 
one ROM line can be in a invalid level. The selected line generates the correct output, while the 
other line can only alter the state of one output bit (assuming a Gray coded ROM) which can be 
regenerated at the ROM output. In short, by ensuring that one of signals driving the logic decoder 
is always at a valid one, a Gray coded ROM properly handles the entire situation resulting 
metastable comparator outputs. Fig 3.13 shows the circuit presented in [15] to convert the 
metastable input (the comparator outputs), in valid high logic level. When the circuit inputs are 
equal, the top transistors are on and hold the circuit output are at VDD. When the difference 
between the input voltages is higher than the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistors, one of 
the outputs is pulled to low while the other remains at VDD. In Fig 3.13(b), the described 
behavior is graphically illustrated by presenting the typical signals at the input and output of this 
circuit. Thus, we adopted the circuit to reduce the metastability errors.

3.4 Digital Encoder Design 
 
In a flash ADC, the function of an encoder is to convert the thermometer code to 
weighted code (like binary or gray code) for the following process and it also can suppress 
some errors (like bubble and metastability errors). Thus the digital encoder is indispensable to 
the flash ADC and the encoder become a limitation while the overall conversion rate is 
increasing. Therefore, for the purpose of implementing the derired encoder to a flash ADC, 
the encoder needs to be discussed carefully and it canapproximately focus on the following 
issues.  
 High-speed operation and low latency 
 Efficient coding scheme to reduce bubble and metastability errors 
 Circuit complexity and area 
 Power consumption   
 
3.4.1 Considerations of Digital Encoder  
 
In generally, the type of encoder usually has two kinds, which has ROM-based and 
logic-based. For a ROM-based, it is very popular structure and used extensively in flash ADC

3.6 Timing Generator Circuit 
 
In a high-speed ADC system, the clock generator requires special attention. However, the 
clock generator circuits in our design are composed of two part: one for the high-speed clock 
at the front-end T/H circuit, and the other is for the comparator array and digital circuit. 
Timing diagram of the whole ADC Converter is shown in Fig 3.18. It is clear that only one 
external clock source is needed for the generation and distribution of the different phase clock 
required by the overall ADC. Although a front-end T/H relaxed the timing skew between 
comparator clock and analog input signal, but the dynamic performance is determined by the 
sampling clock to T/H circuit. So special care must be paid on the clock timing from the input 
source to the clock driver. Because phase noise and sampling jitter is already exists on the 
original clock generator source but is accumulated by the electronics of the clock driver and 
supply noise. To suppress these effect, the number of gates that driving the T/H clock traveled 
through must be minimized and it also can reduce the supply noise. Furthermore the power 
supply of the sampling T/H clock drivers must be separated from other comparator clock 
drivers and digital drivers. However, the proper stage ration is used to get a sharp clock edge 
for suppression of the sampling jitter effect and have the accepted rising time and falling time 
for the ADC operation. Of course, the delay adjustments between the required phase need to 
be arranged by suitable size rations in the timing generator. Finally, the whole timing 
generator circuit is shown in Fig 3.19.

circuits. Beside, to decrease the serious coupling of output buffers, the guard ring is also 
applied for the buffers to decrease the coupling of the output buffers. Moreover, the empty 
area of the chip is placed by the about 1.5nF decoupling capacitors to eliminate the bounce of 
the power supply. Since the chip is measured at the high sampling rate, no ESD devices are 
added at the precedence of each bonding pad and no package is used for the chip. Finally, the 
active area of the ADC is  and the total area is about  since the chip is 
fabricated by TSMC 0.18um 1P6M CMOS technology.

3.8 Simulation Results  
 
In the post-simulation of the proposed flash ADC, 3nH inductance is included to 
approach the inductance of bonding wire connecting the pads and pins. Since the output of the 
proposed flash ADC chip will be linked to a logic analyzer in the measurement, the input 
impendence model of the logic analyzer is covered into the post-simulation. To guarantee the 
ADC chip with a work function, simulation items need to include process variation, 
temperature variation, and supply variation. The FFT results in three design corner are shown 
in Fig 3.21, Fig 3.22, and Fig 3.23, respectively. The largest harmonic tone form -60dB in fast 
case to -40dB in slow case. The dynamic performance is plotted in Fig 3.24 , which indicates 
ENOB of 6B to input frequency of 125MHz. In conclusion, Table 3.1 listed the performance 
summary.

Architecture design of DAC 
 
 
 
 
4.1 Introduction 
 
 For high-speed and high-resolution applications, the current-steering architecture is 
preferred since it can drive a resistive load directly without the need for a voltage buffer [27]. 
However, there are also several causes to limit the static and dynamic performances. In this 
chapter, we will talk about these nonlinear causes in the first section. Next, the 
output-resistance limit of current sources is described. We also discuss the relation between 
the area and the variance of each current source. Finally, we propose a new calibration 
structure to improve these problems. 
Traditionally we use the return-to-zero method to overcome some dynamic nonlinearity. 
But it also loses the half power of output signal and has low power efficiency. Here we also 
propose another fixed-time return-to-zero scheme to achieve high dynamic performance and 
to have high power efficiency simultaneously. 
 
 
4.1.1 Shortcoming of Current-Steering DAC 
 
 Error sources that limit the current-steering DAC performance are as follows [28]-[38]: 
 Output impedance of current sources: 
The finite output resistance affects the linearity of the converter. This is primarily 
due to the fact that the output resistance of the converters is signal-dependent. We often 
use the cascade structure to increase the output impedance of current sources. 
 Voltage drops in the supply lines: 
If the resistance between each current source and power lines is different, it causes 
different voltage drops, which affects the linearity. This error is reduced by widening the 
metal of supply lines or the careful unit-cell placement. 
 Mismatch considerations: 
Since variations in the process cause the oxide thickness and threshold voltage, to 
vary, the unit currents are unequal, which also affects the linearity. This error is often 
eliminated by designing the large unit-cell area. 
 Doping and thermal gradients: 
Since doping and thermal gradients cause the oxide thickness and mobility to vary, 
the unit currents are unequal, which also affects the linearity. This error is often 
overcome by using the careful unit-cell placement. 
 Edge effects: 
Edge mismatch error occurs when the elements does not see the same surroundings 
within a certain radius around them. This error is often eliminated by placing a number 
of dummy rows and columns around current source arrays and the external cost is the 
area of dummy current sources.

phase. The first response is produced with an ideal DAC having a single time constant. 
The error here is linear with the input signal. The second response is produced with an 
ideal DAC having slew rate limited. It will result nonlinearities due to the harmonics 
tones by the squared response.

 Linear Settling Phase: 
Figure 4.3 (a) and (b) display two analog output responses in the linear settling 
phase. The first response is produced by an ideal DAC and the second response is 
produced by a real DAC. The two are compared in Figure 4.3 (c). Mathematically, ( ) ( )-Area  -Area  difference   Area +=               (4-1) 
It can be seen that over a single clock period the nonideal response accumulates 
some error (Area difference) as compared to the ideal response. A dynamic nonlinearity 
will result if this error is not linear with the input signal.

4.2 Design of Current Sources 
 
 In this section, we present several behavioral-level models of current sources in 
current-steering DACs. These models are the topics about output impedance, variances, and 
sizes of current sources. We can also design some parameters by using these models. 
 
 59
 
Figure 4.5 Simulate INL error in different output-impedance conditions. 
 
Also, we can approximately use the following equation to calculate the integral 
nonlinearity in certain output impedance of current sources:

 where N is the total of current sources and Ro is the output resistance of unit current 
source. 
 Next, we talk about how the output impedance affects the dynamic performance. 
Because of differential output signals, the second harmonic is decreasing and the third 
harmonic is dominating the distortion. Figure 4.6 shows another example how the output 
impedance affects the SFDR for differential output. This implies that the output impedance of 
unit current source must be larger than 20 MΩ if the SFDR is guaranteed to larger than 80dB. 
 We also can use the below equation to probably estimate SFDR:

 Figure 4.9 shows Monte-Carlo simulations for dynamic performance in different 
variance of current sources. Here, we discuss the relation between SFDR and various 
variances of current sources. There are 500 samples which are randomly generated and we 
assume 14-bit input data are thermometer-coded. It implies the distribution of SFDR is better 
as the variance of unit current source is smaller.

 In comparison with the above minimum required matching for high static performance, it 
also indicates the minimum required matching for dynamic performance is more relaxed. So 
we choose the minimum required matching to achieve high static linearity as the final 
minimum required matching in this thesis. In next section, we will discuss the choice of area 
and gate-drive voltage to achieve the minimum required matching.

 In conclusion, the above result points out the fact that large-area current sources are 
widely used to maintain high static linearity. But this results in large chip area and high cost. 
In this thesis, a new calibration structure is proposed to compensate the mismatches of current 
sources and to achieve high linearity. With this method, only 9-bit LSB array is not calibrated 
since it needs only to maintain 9-bit accuracy. Furthermore, the chip area is smaller and the 
cost is lower, too.  
 
4.3 Proper Number of Thermometer-Coded ULSB 
 
 The above section indicates the minimum required matching is expected to be less than 
1.31% for the good INL error at 9-bit current-steering DACs. In this section, we will talk 
about how to choose the number of thermometer-coded ULSB to get the good DNL error. 
 In the thermometer architecture, the input code is converted to a thermometer code that 
controls the switches. The advantages of this architecture are its good DNL error and the 
small dynamic switching errors and the disadvantages are the complexity, area, and power 
consumption of the thermometer decoder [46]-[47].

Figure 4.12 Calibration circuit. 
 
 The operation of two-phase calibration is shown in Figure 4.13. 
 At first, shown in Figure 4.13 (a), the LSB and REF currents are connected to node A. 
The transistor generates the store current (Istore) which is equal to the difference between 
LSB and REF currents. It also means that this store current is stored in the charge of the 
capacitance. The phase of adjusting reference currents is completed. 
 Next, shown in Figure 4.13 (b), the path between the node A and the capacitance is 
turned off so the charge of the capacitance will not disappear. Then, the MSB, CAL, and REF 
currents are connected to node A and CAL currents are swept from the highest value toward 
zero. It is shown in Figure 4.14. When the total of MSB and CAL currents is littler than the 
sum of REF and store currents, the comparator changed its state. Here, the calibration result is 
stored into D flip-flop registers and does not disappear until the chip supply is turned off. The 
phase of calibrating most significant bit currents is completed.

4.4.3 Calibration Process 
 
 We have determined the number of calibrating MSBs and the calibration step in above 
sections. Next, we will talk about the error range due to the calibration step and the 5-bit 
calibration process. 
 Figure 4.15 displays the two error range after the 1-bit MSB calibration and explains 
how the external 1/6 LSB current is needed. Figure 4.15 (a) shows the error range of MSB 
current after the calibration. The calibration current is swept from the highest value toward 
zero and holds on after the sum of the MSB and calibration currents is larger than the sum of 
LSB currents. Here, the 1-bit MSB calibration is finished and this calibration current is stored. 
This indicates the error range is between ∑ LSBI  and LSBILSB 3/1−∑ . This is distinct 
from the condition which we assume in prior section. Then, Figure 4.15 (b) shows the 
different error range of MSB current by using external 1/6LSB current during the calibration. 
That results the new error range is between LSBILSB 6/1+∑  and . 
And that implies the external 1/6LSB is needed.

One common solution to improve the dynamic nonlinearity problem is to use the 
return-to-zero (RZ) scheme at the DAC output [36]-[38], [49]. This is shown in Figure 4.17. 
Figure 4.17 (a) draws the timing of the output and control signals and Figure 4.17 (b) displays 
the circuit of the return-to-zero scheme. 
 During the first half of the clock cycle, the transistors operate as a low resistance and 
lower the effective output resistance. At the moment, the output is attenuated by the parallel 
connection of a low resistance. Because these nonlinearity causes occur at this moment, these 
errors are eliminated and the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the DACs is raised. 
During the second half of the clock cycle, the low resistance is removed and the output tracks 
the original DAC output. In conclusion, this return-to-zero scheme effectively improves the 
dynamic performance at the cost of half output power.

4.5.1 Proposed Return-to-Zero Method 
 
 We have discussed the advantage and disadvantage of the common return-to-zero 
scheme. Here, we propose a new fixed-time return-to-zero method to improve the 
disadvantage of power efficiency. It can improve the dynamic linearity with raising the output 
efficiency. Because the nonlinearity causes like glitch happen during the fixed time when the 
output of an input code changes to the output of the next input code. It means this fixed time 
is the best time of attenuating output signal. If the DAC output is attenuated only during this 
fixed time, some output signal power can be saved. It is a good solution to maintain high 
dynamic linearity and to simultaneously raise output power efficiency. 
 Figure 4.18 (a) draws the proposed short-pulse circuit to produce the attenuate signal, 
atten. When the value of clock signal is low to high, there is a short pulse at the attenuate 
signal. The width of this pulse is determined by the delay of the inverter arrays and the 
maximum width is limited by the positive half period of clock signal. Figure 4.18 (b) and (c) 
display the timing of the attenuate and output signals. It means the output signal (Vout_RZ) 
only attenuates at the fixed time when the nonlinearity causes occurs. Figure 4.18 (d) shows 
the circuit of the return-to-zero scheme. It is similar to the conventional return-to-zero circuit

 We illustrate the result in Figure 4.19. Figure 4.19 (a) draws the not-return-to-zero signal. 
Figure 4.19 (b) shows the conventional return-to-zero DAC. This DAC has 50% duty cycle of 
output signal, α=0.5. The power efficiency is also equal to 50%. Figure 4.19 (c) and (d) 
display the proposed return-to-zero DAC. These DACs have 75% and 87.5% power efficiency 
of output signal and do not produce any harmonics corresponding to in-of-baseband 
frequencies. Besides output power efficiency, the magnitudes of images in these DACs are 
also different, but these images will be filtered out by using the low-pass filter.

 In conclusion, the above result indicates this fixed-time return-to-zero method is a good 
method to eliminate the glitch effect, achieve high dynamic linearity, and maintain high 
output power efficiency. 
 
 
4.6 Summary 
 
 In this chapter, we determine the proper output impedance, variance, and the size of 
current sources. To achieve small chip size and low cost, we invent a new calibration structure 
to correct the mismatch error of current sources. To achieve high dynamic nonlinearity and 
high output power efficiency, we propose the novel fixed-time return-to-zero scheme. It can 
achieve high dynamic performance without losing too much power at DAC output.

5.2 Digital Circuits 
 
 In this section, the digital circuit of calibration structure and the binary-to-thermometer 
decoder are described. First circuit is used to turn the switches on and off during the 
calibration and to memorize the data of correcting the MSB currents. Second is to convert the 
input binary code to the thermometer code. 
 
5.2.1 Digital Circuits of Calibration Structure 
 
 The states of the calibration are illustrated in Figure 5.2. The adjusting state is to adjust 
the reference current to equal to the ULSB and LLSB currents with an external LSB current. 
Next, the calibrating state is to trim the MSB current to the above reference current. It means 
that eleven states are needed since five MSBs are calibrated.

5.3 Current Cell 
 
 The base components of current-steering DACs are current cells. In this chapter, we talk 
about current source cells, reference current cells, and calibration current cells. The next two 
cells are used during the calibration. 
 
5.3.1 Current Source Cell 
 
 The current source cells generate the output current which directly drives the external 
resistance. But one source of nonlinearity is the finite output impedance of the current sources. 
When the output voltage varies between zero and full scale, a different number of current 
sources are connected to the output and different impedances are seen at the output node. This 
finite output impedance is lower at the MSB current cells which are implemented by 
connecting many units of the array in parallel. Here we use the gain-boosting structure to raise 
the output impedance in MSB cells. This is shown in Figure 5.7 (a) and Figure 5.7 (b) 
displays the ULSB and LLSB cells.

where ( )bMmsbgMmsbgMmsb RoRogA ___ //≅                       (5-2) 
 And the output impedance of ULSB and LLSB cells is given by 
 McsMcasMswpMcasMswpLLSBULSBimp RoRoRoggZ ≅,_                  (5-3) 
 where gMswp and RoMswp mean the transconductance and output impedance of the 
transistors, Mswp. 
 
 Besides of finite output-impedance effect, the mismatch is also an error source that will 
limit the static and dynamic linearity. We use the careful layout placement and add dummy 
cells to overcome the symmetry mismatch. This is shown at the final section of this chapter. 
Here, only the random mismatch is discussed. The above chapter indicates that the matching 
requirement is smaller than 1.31% for 9-bit accuracy. There are two dimensions of the unit 
current source transistors which used in this DAC, as listed in Table 5.2. This meets the 
matching requirement. 
 
 85
5.3.3 Calibration Current Cell 
 
 The calibration current varies during the calibration and holds on after the calibration. 
The calibration current is swept from the highest value toward zero. When the sum of MSB 
and calibration currents are equal to the sum of ULSB and LLSB currents with an external 
LSB current, the sweep is stopped. 
 Figure 5.10 displays the circuit of calibration current cells. The crossing point voltage of 
switching current to output is low when the sw signal is high-to-low. The output current is 
settled faster and therefore it increases the speed of the calibration. On the contrary, for a 
low-to-high transition of the sw signal, the crossing point voltage is high. Here, the current is 
switched to ground and does not affect the output calibration current.

 Next, we will decide the resolution of calibration DACs which we need. 
 In this thesis, the variance of the unit current source cell is 1.31% to achieve 9-bit 
linearity since the 5-bit MSBs are calibrated. So, the range of calibration DACs must be large 
than the worst-case change of MSB current cells. Here, we assume the variance of the 5-bit 
MSBs is in the Gauissian Distribution. This probability where the range of the variance is 
smaller 3.5σ is large than 99.95%. Table 5.3 lists the results about the range of the variance 
of 5-bit MSB.

amplifier is realized by one-stage opamp. Besides, there is a large capacitance which connects 
the voltage Vbr and the ground to generate noise-insensitive current, Imain. Figure 5.12 (b) 
displays the local bias circuit of current source cells. The local biasing is separated into eight 
sections. There is no direct connection between any two sections. The will reduce the 
systematic and graded errors in current sources but the complexity of the whole connection 
increases. We will discuss the placement of current cells of eight sections lately. 
 Figure 5.13 draws the brief bias circuit about the relation of MSB, ULSB, LLSB, 
reference, and calibration currents. This indicates the main bias circuits produces three 
various currents. One is reference currents and the other two is used for bias circuit of MSB, 
ULSB and LLSB current cells. And the calibration currents are mirrored from the LLSB 
currents. This implies when the main current increases, various currents in this DAC also 
increase, and it does not cause any nonlinearity.

5.5 High-Speed Latch 
 
 The dynamic performance of current-steering DACs can be characterized by the 
dynamic nonlinearities associated with current source switching. These nonlinearities are 
mainly caused by the following effects: 
 ․An imperfect synchronization of the current switches. 
․Current variance due to a drain voltage variation of the current sources when both 
current switches are simultaneously in the off-state. 
 91

5.6 Layout 
 
 In this section, we will talk about the placement of the MSB and ULSB cells. Next, the 
floorplan of the whole DAC is drawn. Finally, the layout of the whole DAC is displayed. 
 Figure 5.18 draws the placement of MSB and ULSB current cells. It is divided into eight 
areas, as shown in Figure 5.18 (a) and there are eight local bias circuits placed on them. The 
shaped area represents the dummy cells which are added to avoid edge effects. Figure 5.18 (b) 
draws the Magnifier of Area 1 in Figure 5.18 (a). Since five MSBs are calibrated, the target of 
the placement of MSB current cells is to let the variance of MSB currents less than the 
calibration range which we designed in above section.

Measurement Results of ADC and DAC 
 
 
 
 
6.1 Measurement Results of ADC 
 
Here, some issues of the proposed flash ADC measurement are discussed, which contain 
measurement setup and PCB fabrication. Since the device under test will work at the high 
sampling rate, a careful consideration of the testing needs to be paid; otherwise, the 
experiment result may be fail. 
 
6.1.1 Measurement Setup 
 
A correct measurement setup decides whether a actual performance of the ADC can be 
gotten or not so that some considerations about the setup are discussed here. At first, Fig 6.1 
show a overall setup of the ADC testing. In the setup, an input signal is produced by a RF 
signal generator and passes through a low-pass filter. To decrease high-band noise caused by 
the signal generator. Then a following RF transformer(balun) converts the input signal to the 
differential signal for the ADC chip. To provide power supply voltage for the ADC, four 
power supplies are used for the chip power and two precision power supplies give the 
reference voltages. As to the clock generator, it uses a high-speed data generator with jitter 
rms <25ps (typical 10ps) and the maximum clock rate 1GHz. The logic analyzer with the 
maximum external clock rate 1GHz and input capacitance 0.2pF can capture digital codes of 
the ADC output. Then MATLAB programs are used to do FFT works.

6.2 Measurement Results of DAC 
 
 Figure 6.5 displays the test environment to measure the DAC [51]. The several 
instruments which are needed to test are as follow: 
․Pulse Generator (HP 80000) which produces a low-jitter clock for the chip and the 
instrument of pattern generator to synchronize the input data. 
․Pattern Generator (HP 16522) which produces the 14-bits input digital data. 
 ․Power Supply (HP 66332A) which produces the clear analog and clock power. 
 ․Power Supply (HP 3310A) which produces the digital power. 
 ․Two 50Ω resistances which convert the output current to output voltage. 
․The transformer which converts differential output to single output. 
․Spectrum Analyzer (HP3589A) measurement the spectrum of the output voltage 
signal. 
 
 
Figure 6.5 Test environment of the 14-bit 200-MHz DAC. 
 
 
 Figure 6.6 shows the photograph of PCB to measure the static and dynamic performance 
of 14-bits 200-MHz DAC. 
 Figure 6.7 displays the measured integral and differential nonlinearity performances. The 
INL and DNL are 3.88 LSB and 5.66 LSB. The function of calibration is failed because the 
variance of MSB currents is larger than the designed calibration range. So the INL and DNL 
can not be less than 0.5 LSB. 
Figure 6.8 and Figure 6.9 shows the output spectrum for different output frequency. The 
spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is 65dB at 174 kHz and 68dB at 1.98 MHz when this 
DAC operates at the clock of 20 MS/s. Figure 5.13 shows the measured SFDR as a function 
of the signal frequency. The SFDR remains above 60 dB up to a signal frequency of 3-MHz at 
the update rate of 20 MS/s.

ersion at 250MHz. Several new circuit techniques are proposed for the flash ADC so that 
the ADC can operate at high operating rate. A Switching preamplifier is proposed to avoid 
using non-overlap control signals required by conventional autozeroing ADCs and to 
eliminate the interference, caused by the high-speed autozeroing operation, at input node. 
Besides, New autozeroing with renterpolation and capacitor averaging technique is proposed 
to reduce the area and input capacitance of the used switching preamplifier to practice the 
high-speed flash efficiently. 
In order to ensure good
 high speed digital circuit, the A/D converter is implemented in fully differential 
architecture. To relax timing problems in high-speed converters, like limited comparator 
bandwidth and timing skew between analog input signal and comparator strobe signal, a 
wide-band T/H circuit is used at the front-end of ADC converter. Offset problems are the main 
errors of the flash ADC and thus, the proposed technique has been verified to reduce the offset 
efficiently. The ADC is controlled by a correct timing generator and has the excepted actions. 
Based on 0.18um 1P6M CMOS process, the ADC has an active area 0.935mm2 and 
consumes 180 mW (including output buffers) at 1.8V power supply . 
 Also, a 14-bit 200-MHz DAC is implemented. We propose
structure and fixed-time return-to-zero scheme to improve the static and dynamic linearity. 
The size of unit current sources is larger with the increase of the resolution. With the 
self-calibration, only 9-bits accuracy is required and the area, cost, and power consumption is 
lower. Then, we use the Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the minimum matching 
requirement and the optimum thermometer-coded ULSBs. Several components such as 
current comparator, calibration DACs, and digital circuits are also designed to realize this 
calibration structure. Besides, the nonlinear output transient degrades the dynamic linearity. 
Recently, the return-to-zero method is used to attenuate the output when this nonlinear 
transient occurs, but loses half of output power, too. Here, we design the short-pulse circuit to 
generate the fixed-time pulse signal to attenuate the output. With the fixed-time return-to-zero 
scheme, we can achieve high dynamic performance without losing much output power. 
 The DAC occupies 1.07mm X 1.07 mm in a 0.18-um 1P6M CMOS process. 
si lation, the INL and DNL is expected to be less than 0.5 LSB and the SFDR is 77dB at the 
lower output frequency and 68dB at the high output frequency when this DAC operates at the 
design clock of 200MS/s. It consumes 25mW during the calibration and 43mW after the 
calibration from a 1.8V supply. In the measurement, the INL is 3.66LSB and the SFDR 
remains above 60 dB up to a signal frequency of 3-MHz at the update rate of 20 MS/s.
