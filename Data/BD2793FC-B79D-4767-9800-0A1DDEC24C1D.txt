shell, displacement and thermal stresses are calculated numerically. To illustrate the foregoing 
analysis, numerical calculations for a circular multi-layered conical shell subjected to the cooling 
process and the blasting pressure at the boundary surface were performed. In this examined case, 
the laminated circular conical shell with bottom surface clamped is composed of three different 
isotropic layers, in which the nondimensional thickness of each layer is taken for =0.3, 
=0.1 and =0.3, respectively. The nondimensional length along the x-direction is =4.5 and 
the semi-vertex angle of the cone is 
1h
2h 3h L
6πα = . The nondimensional inner and outer radii of the 
cone at the small and large edges are assumed to be 1.0 and 1.7 respectively. The nondimensional 
outer and inner temperatures are assumed to be  and 150, respectively. The top and 
bottom nondimensional temperatures are assumed to be 25 and 150, respectively. Furthermore the 
blasting pressure is assumed to be  on the inner surface. The nondimensional rate 
of the cooling and the blasting pressure are all assumed to be 1.0.

For the convergence test of the present method, we calculate the temperature values at the 
point x =1.73, z =1.70 with different number of finite difference gird points and different time 
as shown in Table 1. Results show that the temperature changes very small as the number of the 
grid point increases, say gird points is 144 )12( =N . From Table 1, we can see that under various 
number of gird points of finite difference method, the solutions are rapidly convergent. It is well 
known that the temperature tends to steady as the time increase. As the time increases, for 
example, =6.0 to 8.0, the temperatures vary slightly in each layer, since the steady state is 
approached as the time increases. Therefore, in the present study, we chose gird points = 
196  to evaluate the temperature distribution, displacement and thermal stresses in a 
laminated circular conical shell for small time =0.1, which is in transient state, and large time 
=8.0, which approaches the steady state.

which can be applied to design useful structures or machines in engineering applications. There is 
no limit to the number of layers in such a circular conical shell, and the hybrid Laplace 
transform/finite-difference method can be applying various time-dependent boundary conditions. 
Application of the present theory to laminated circular conical shells reveals that the finite 
difference method is rapidly convergent. The discontinuity of circumferential stress at the 
interfaces was found. It was found that the temperature distribution, the displacement and the 
thermal stresses vary slightly as time intervals increase.
