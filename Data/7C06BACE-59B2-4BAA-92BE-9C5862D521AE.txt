 In present study, a numerical wave tank model was developed to 
simulate the breaking of a solitary wave over a continental shelf.  The 
unsteady, two-dimensional Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) 
equations and the turbulence model ( ε−k  model) were solved to 
simulate the realistic fluid. A hybrid particle level set method (Enright 
et al., 2002) was applied to capture the interface between the air and 
water phases. A piston-type wavemaker was located at the upstream of 
the wave tank and generated the incident waves.

LEVEL SET METHOD 
The level set method is a numerical technique proposed 
originally by Osher and Sethian (1988) for treating the evolution of 
interfaces and shapes.  Advantage of the level set method is that one 
can perform numerical computations involving curves and surfaces on 
an Eulerian approach (with a fixed Cartesian grid). Also, the level set 
method makes it easy to follow shapes which change topology, e.g. 
when a shape splits in two, develops holes, or the reverse of these 
operations. 
In two dimensions, the level set method represents a closed 
curve Γ in the plane as the zero level set of a two-dimensional 
auxiliary function φ , 
}{ 0),(),(Γ == yxyx φ  (12) 
and then manipulating Γ implicitly through the function φ .  This 
function is called a level set function. In general the signed distance 
function was chosen as the level set function. In this study, the 
interface Γ between the air and the water is the zero level set of a 
smoothed distance function )(x,y,tφ , with 0<φ  denoting the air 
region and 0>φ  the water region. The function φ  is defined as the 
signed normal distance from the interface Γ and satisfies 1=∇φ . 
During the time evolution, φ  could be seen as a property convected 
with the flow field.  Hence, 
O
x
U
t j
j =∂
∂+∂
∂ φφ  (13) 
However, numerical diffusion will arise after a finite amount of 
computation time, i.e. the level set φ  will become irregular and no 
longer be a distance function. Thus, the level set function φ  must be 
re-initialized at each time step to ensure that the level set function φ  
maintains a smooth distance function. This aim can be achieved by 
iterating the following partial differential equation to reach a steady 
state and then replacing )(x,y,tφ  by )(x,y,τd  (Peng et al., 1999). 
( )dSd ∇−=∂∂ 0.1)(φτ  (14) 
where τ  is an artificial time and )(φS  is a smoothed sign function 
expressed as  
222
)(
Δ∇+
≡
φφ
φφS  (15) 
In the numerical computation, the thickness of interface, 2Δ, is chosen 
at least three cells in the direction normal to the interface Γ. Thus, the 
level set function will remain as a distance function with φ∇  
converges to unit without changing its zero level set. In numerical 
implementation, however, mass error may arise during the re-
distancing procedure. 
HYBRID PARTICLE LEVEL SET METHOD 
To overcome the drawback of level set method, Enright et al. 
(2002) proposed the particle level set method to improve the mass 
783
  
 
numerical computation is 100×100 with a uniform grid size of 
5.0== yx ΔΔ  and a constant time step of 25.0Δ =t . The slotted disk 
is initially centered at (50,75) and rotates around a centre (50,50) with 
a constant angular velocity 0.01.Notably from Fig. 2 that the level set 
function has advanced quite well as compared with the original shape. 
Besides, the contour distribution implies that the level set function re-
distances accurately as a signed distance function during the time 
evolution. Furthermore, combined the numerical results of the hybrid 
particle level set method with traditional level set method in the same 
figure, it reveals that hybrid particle level set method has substantially 
overcome the numerical diffusion of traditional level set method, 
which dominates the conservation of mass. Using such hybrid method, 
we could investigate complex phenomena of wave motion, such as 
wave breaking, overtopping etc., more precisely.

particle level set method; (- - -) target level set distribution ( L )

To demonstrate the accuracy of present model for simulating the 
wave breakings, the numerical results of the wave profile on a 
continental shelf, from the incident stage to the breaking point, were 
compared with the experimental data. Figure 3 shows a schematic 
diagram of the experimental setup performed by Yasuda et al. (1997). 
The still water ho was set at 0.31m, the height of the shelf is 0.263m, 
and the incident solitary wave height was Hi = 0.1314m. Four wave 
gauges (P1 to P4) were distributed near the leading edge of the 
continental shelf to record the temporal water surface elevation. To 
reduce the computational time, the numerical wave flume was set up in 
a finite domain of 10.5 meters long (about 5.0 times of the effective 
wave length) and 0.6 meter high (about 2.0 times of the still water 
depth) using 3500 × 200 uniform computation cells. The upstream 
boundary condition was applied to generate the desired incident 
solitary wave coincident with that recorded at station P1, i.e. with 
incident wave height of 0.4 ho. The shelf was installed at 8.5 meters 
(about 4.0 times of affective wave length) away from the wave paddle, 
and the wave probes were arranged at the same relative locations to the 
shelf as in Yasuda’s experiments. Figure 4 compares the numerical and 
experimental water surface elevations at wave gauges P2 to P4. The 
wave gauge P4 was placed in the vicinity of the breaking point (B.P.). 
In this figure, lines represent the numerical results and symbols 
represent experimental data. The comparison shows that evolution of 
the wave profiles from the initial incident stage to the wave breaking 
can be properly simulated using this model.

EVOLUTION OF THE OVERTURNING WAVE ON A 
CONTINENTAL SHELF 
Figure 5 presents the evolution of the breaking solitary wave on 
the continental shelf from the initial incident wave at 20.2=t  sec, Fig. 
5 (a), to 96.3=t sec, Fig. 5 (i), when the third splashup has reattached 
the free surface. The incident wave conditions and the shelf in Fig. 5 
are the same as those presented in Fig. 3. Figures 5 (b) to (d) show that 
when the solitary wave propagates over the continental shelf, the 
leading part of the wave rises due to the shoaling effect. For shallow 
water waves, the phase speed of the wave increases with the water 
depth. Hence, the top portion of the wave propagates at a faster speed 
than the bottom of the wave. This causes the wave steepening toward 
the front, see Fig. 5(e), and the leading part of the wave eventually 
topples over, see Fig. 5(f). This gives rise to the typical picture of wave 
breaking. Notably from Fig. 5(e), the breaking point (B. P.) occurs at 
xb = 30.2 ho, in the vicinity of the wave gauge P4.  Due to gravity, a 
series of splash-up occurs subsequently.  The entrained air bubbles and 
the splash-up process of the overturning waves could be observed 
clearly from Fig. 5(g) to (i). Evolution of the overturning wave as 
described above is similar to the laboratory’s observation of solitary 
wave overturning on a slope (Li and Raichlen, 2003). The results in 
Fig. 5 demonstrate that the present model is able to capture the 
complex phenomena involved in the wave breaking, such as the wave 
deformation, overturning, and splash-ups.

CONCLUSIONS 
In present study, the numerical model developed for simulating 
breaking waves was applied to investigate the evolution of breaking 
solitary waves over a continental shelf. The unsteady Reynolds 
Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the ε−k  model were 
solved to resolve the turbulent viscous flows. The hybrid particle level 
set method was applied to capture the complex free surface evolution, 
beginning from the steepening of the wave profile to the wave 
breaking. Based on the numerical results, the following conclusions 
can be drawn. 
1. The Zalesak’s problem was performed to examine the particle level 
set method. By comparing the numerical results of the hybrid 
particle level set method with traditional level set method, it 
revealed that hybrid particle level set method had substantially 
overcame the numerical diffusion of traditional level set method, 
which dominated the conservation of mass. 
2. The numerical results of the wave profile on a continental shelf, 
from the incident stage to the breaking point, were shown to be in 
good agreement with the experimental data. 
3. Simulation of the evolution of a breaking solitary wave on a 
continental shelf demonstrates that the present model is able to 
capture the complex phenomena involved in the wave breaking, 
such as the wave deformation, splash-ups and reattachments. 
4. The numerical results reveal that the maximum speed of the fluid 
particles as the wave front begins to overturn is about 0.89 Co, 
while as the ejected jet re-attaches the undisturbed water (first time 
of re-attachment), it is about 1.30 Co, and as the splashed water re-
attaches the undisturbed water (second time of re-attachment), the 
maximum speed is 1.84 Co. Thereafter, the maximum speed 
decreases gradually to 1.27 Co as the third time of re-attachment 
occurs.
