以矽為基板材料的 MOSFETs，預估在 2011 年之前，閘極線寬將到達被認為是最小物理極
限的 10 奈米，因此，近年來三五族電晶體的技術，特别是以砷化銦鎵(InxGa1-xAs)為通道
的 MOSFETs 與異質結構高電子遷移率電晶體(HEMT)，由於擁有比傳統矽基材 MOSFETs

三、  報告內容  
研究背景  
在過去的幾十年內，以矽為主要基材的金氧半電晶體元件(MOSFETs)遵循著摩爾定
律，尺寸的微縮進入了次微米的領域；然而，在二十一世紀，閘極線寬卻到達了 10 奈米
的製程瓶頸；因此，當前最重要的課題，即是提出解決的辦法來增加 CMOS 元件的運算速
度與降低其能量消耗並突破摩爾定律的障礙。為了降低能量消耗，我們可以降低外加偏壓
於元件上，但是這同時也會降低元件的操作速度；由於在直流電性下，三五族材料展現出
低電功率耗損以及高載子遷移速度的特性，因此，本計畫研究以砷化銦鎵(InGaAs)為通道
之三五族金氧半電晶體元件(III-V MOSFETs)與高電子遷移率電晶體(HEMTs)，藉由改變半
4 
 
(例如：銻化銦， InSb)，除此之外，還可以形成不同的三元化合物 (例如：砷化
銦鎵， InxGa1-xAs, 0≦ x≦ 1)，甚至於是四元化合物；這種多元的化合物能夠
藉由改變化合物內的元素含量，進而改變材料的能階差、電子遷移速率…等性
質。   
選擇砷化銦鎵做為研究的方向，是因為在本實驗室的研究中發現，以砷化
銦鎵為通道的  MOS 電容器，有極佳的累積與強反轉表現，這項成果為發展  
III-V MOSFETs 奠定了一個良好的基礎。另外，砷化銦鎵材料，具有高電子
遷移率 (約為 10000 cm/Vs)、高峰值電子漂移速率 (約 2.4 x 101 7cm/s)以及非常
低的電子有效質量 (~0.045 電子質量 )，其中又會因為此種化合物所含銦的成份
不同而性質有所不同；一般而言，當銦的含量不斷提高時，電子遷移速率與高
峰值電子漂移速率都會大幅提升，而電子有效質量則是會顯著下降。然而，在
元件應用方面，因為砷化銦鎵材料其價帶與導帶間的能階較小，電子容易跳越
能帶差距而產生漏電流，所以需要一個能間隙高的介電層材料，以降低閘極的
漏電流情形。   
 
(2)氧化層的選用  
當選用 III-V 族化合物半導體材料做為新一代 MOSFETs 元件時，氧化物
的選擇是一個很重要的問題，這是由於  III-V 族化合物材料並不像矽一樣，能
夠自身與氧分子形成高緻密性、能階間隙大的自身氧化物，因此，必須將目標
轉往其他間接材料。一般而言，要符合適用於高效能  MOSFETs 元件的閘極介
電層材料，需要具備以下的性質：   
(a) 高介電係數 (10 < k < 50)  
(b) 具有很大的能階間隙 (通常接近於或大於六個電子伏特 )  
(c) 等效氧化層厚度小 (等效氧化層厚度 =二氧化矽介電係數 х  高介電材料厚
度 /高介電材料的介電係數 )  
(d) 低漏電現象，高絕緣特性   
(e) 造成很小的平帶電壓平移   
(f)  材料內部缺陷密度低   
(g) 不具有磁滯現象   
(h) 高熱穩定度   
(i)  沉積或成長製程上容易   
在此研究，將以氧化鉿、氧化鑭、氧化鐠與氧化鈰等氧化層材料為主，製作 III-V MOSFETs。 
 
˙閘極介電材料與半導體間介面處理  
製作高效能金氧半電容器與電晶體，最重要的步驟在於閘極氧化物鍍膜前
的表面處理，在本計劃中將採用多種酸性溶液浸泡，利用酸液對原生氧化物的
清除能力，洗去在磊晶表層因成長不均勻且品質不穩定的原生氧化物；接著再
以硫化銨浸泡，經過這個步驟之後，硫化銨溶液中的硫離子會與表面的懸鍵結
合形成一層薄薄的保護層，可以同時達到修補表面缺陷與進一步形成表層保護
膜的效果。

(1)  Study of the inversion behaviors of Al 2O3 /InXGa1 - XAs 
The epitaxial structures of the InXGa1 -XAs MOS capacitors with different In contents of 
0.53, 0.7, and 1.0 in this study are as shown in Fig. 1-1. These structures were grown on a 3-inch 
n+-InP substrate by MBE method. The n+-InP substrates were used for easy Ohmic formation on 
the backside. For all the InXGa1 -XAs layers in these structures, the Si doping concentration was 
5х1017/cm3. For higher In content structures, the structures were graded from In0.53Ga0.47As to 
In0.7Ga0.3As, and then to InAs to adjust the lattice mismatches between the InXGa1-XAs epitaxial 
layers with different In contents. Al2O3 ﬁlms were deposited on these epitaxial structures using 
ALD method as high-j dielectric for the MOS capacitor study. After HCl (10%) solution etch for 
1 min, (NH4)2SX treatment at 60
0
C for 30 min [1,2] was used to passivate the surface and reduce 
InXGa1-XAs surface native oxides [3]. The sulfur treatment of MOS capacitors can reduce the 
leakage current and improve the C–V characteristics of the MOS capacitor [4]. After (NH4)2SX 
treatment, the growth of ALD Al2O3  was carried out at 300
0
C, using Trimethylaluminum (TMA) 
and H2O as the precursors, and purged with N2 gas. Al2O3  layers of 16 nm were deposited on 
these epitaxial layers for was performed at 500
0
C for 60 s in the forming gas ambient. Then, 
Ti/Pt/Au metal was deposited as gate metal by lift-off process. The backside Ohmic contacts were 
formed by Au/Ge/Ni/Au evaporation followed by rapid thermal annealing at 450
0
C for 30 s. The 
schematics of the cross sections of the MOS capacitors are as shown in Fig. 1-1.  
 
Fig. 1-1 Epitaxial structures of the InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors with different In contents. 
 
To study the formation mechanisms of the accumulation and inversion regions of the 
InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors, InXGa1-XAs layers with different In contents of 0.53, 0.7, and 1.0 
were grown on the n+-InP substrate with structures as shown in Fig. 1-1, and the 
capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics as a function of frequency were measured for these 
InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors. For these measurements, the dc voltage was swept from negative to 
positive voltages (-4 to 4 V) on these capacitors. The dc voltage was swept slowly at a ﬁxed step 
of 0.05 V to allow the inversion charges to respond to the ac probe frequency to obtain 
low-frequency curve. However, if the dc voltage was swept slowly to allow the inversion charge 
to form but the ac probe frequency was too high for the inversion charges to respond, then the 
high-frequency curve obtained will be of very low capacitance even at high negative gate bias [5].

 due to the lower bandgap of InAs material. Compared toτR 
of In0.53Ga0.47As τR of InAs is extracted to be shorter. Because of the shorter response time of 
minority carrier in InAs, a strong inversion layer is formed and can response to the 
high-frequency external ac signals [9]. On the other hand, for the operation of MOSFETs, the 
inversion voltage Vi and the maximum depletion width dp can be expressed as the following 
equations [10]:

Where ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration, Na is the doping concentration, and es is the 
substrate dielectric constant. From the two equations above, small Vi and dp in InAs can be 
obtained because of the high intrinsic carrier concentration. Therefore, the C–V curve for InAs 
at 1 MHz exhibits strong inversion due to the high intrinsic carrier concentration for narrow band 
gap InAs material [6].

/n-In0.53Ga0.47As/n+-InP MOS capacitors under various 
frequencies from 1kHz to 1MHz. 
 
Fig. 1-5 Comparisons of C-V characteristics at 1MHz for 
InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors. 
 
These results are in agreement with the data shown in Table 1-1, i.e., as the In content 
increases in the InXGa1-XAs ﬁlm, the Cinv/Cacc ratio at 1 MHz becomes larger due to the shorter 
response time of the minority carriers [11]. The stronger inversion efﬁciency with higher 
Cinv/Cacc ratio was observed for InAs capacitor at 100 kHz and 1 MHz. Table 1 also exhibits 
that inversion layer capacitance DCinv, 1K–1M (Cinv,1K–Cinv,1M) which is deﬁned as the 
difference in inversion capacitance between the frequency of 1 kHz and 1 MHz for InXGa1-XAs 
layers. Overall, InAs has the smallest inversion capacitance difference of 12.41 pF as compared 
to that of 93.87 pF for In0.53Ga0.47As and 38.85pF for In0.7Ga0.3As. Due to the shorter minority 
response time of InAs, a strong inversion in InAs channel was formed and can respond to a 
high-frequency external ac signal at the gate. 
As summarized in Table 1-1 and explained earlier, InAs has the highest Cinv/Cacc ratio and 
smallest inversion capacitance difference DCinv, 1K–1M, this can be attributed to the strong 
inversion of InAs capacitor due to higher drift velocity and shorter minority response time of 
InAs. These data are in accordance with the inversion phenomena observed for the ALD 7.8-nm 
10 
 
occurrence depends on the quality and the densiﬁcation effect of the high-dielectric [13]. It can be 
seen that hysteresis voltage in the C–V curves for the InXGa1-XAs materials were very small, 
which implies very good Al2O3 ﬁlm quality. 
One of the key parameters for the MOS devices is the leakage current through the high-j 
dielectric for low power logic application. The high tunneling gate leakage current would 
increase the power consumption of the devices. As can be seen from Fig. 1-8, the gate current 
density (JG) of In0.53Ga0.47As, In0.7Ga0.3As, and InAs MOS capacitors are in 10
-8
A/cm
2
 range at 
gate voltage (VG) of 3V. In addition, the tunneling current at biases above 5 V has a good 
consistency with the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism, indicating a low trap density 
inside Al2O3 dielectric. Overall, very low leakage current density around 10
-8
A/cm
2
 for 
InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors can be achieved using Al2O3 as the gate dielectric which is important 
for high-performance low power logic applications.

investigated with several post deposition annealing (PDA) temperatures. Hafnium (HfO2) based 
gate dielectric is deposited using molecular beam deposition (MBD) methods. After oxide 
deposition, the HfO2/n-InAs/InGaAs structures were annealed at different PDA temperatures of 
400 
o
C, 450 
o
C, 500 
o
C, and 550 
o
C. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements and the X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed to study the influence of different post 
annealing temperatures on the improvement of interface quality of the HfO2/n-InAs/InGaAs 
MOS structures. 
The wafers used in this work were molecular beam epitaxy grown 51017 cm-3 Si-doped 
n-type 5 nm InAs / 3 nm In0.7Ga0.3As/ 10 nm In0.53Ga0.47As epi-layers on the 3 inch n
+
 InP 
substrates. The MOS capacitor process steps include surface treatments, oxide deposition, post 
deposition annealing, gate metal deposition, and formation of ohmic contact on the backside of n
+
 
InP substrate. After degreasing in acetone and isopropanol, the wafers were cleaned in a HF 
solution (49 %) for 3 minutes, and then followed by sulfur treatment in a (NH4)2S solution (7 %) 
for 30 minutes at room temperature. The surface treated wafers were loaded into the MBD system 
for the deposition of 15 nm HfO2 at 300 
o
C with an oxygen pressure at 10
-8
 torr. The growth rate 
was controlled in 0.05Å  per sec and detected by crystal. After that, post deposition annealing 
(PDA) process was performed with temperatures ranging from 400 
o
C to 550 
o
C in forming gas 
for 5 minutes. Finally, Ni metal (contact size: 50 μm in diameter) was deposited on the front side 
of the wafer as gate contact metal and Au metal was deposited by sputtering process on the 
backside of n+ InP substrates to finish the fabrication process.  
Figure 2-1 shows the cross-sectional high resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM) 
micrograph of as deposited HfO2/n-InAs/InGaAs sample. The TEM image shows good 
HfO2/InAs stack with indistinguishable interfacial layer. On the HfO2/In0.53Ga0.47As structure 
which underwent very similar process condition, a TEM image exhibited a thin native oxides 
layer between HfO2 and In0.53Ga0.47As (data not shown). This indicates that the HfO2/InAs 
structure seems to have better interfacial quality than that of HfO2/InGaAs structure. The studies 
of high-k/InGaAs with various In content were discussed
1, 2)
 and it was believed that the less 
Ga-related oxide formation when increasing In content would result in the improvement of 
high-k/InGaAs interfacial quality.

Figure 2-4 shows the bidirectional C-V curves of samples at frequency of 100 kHz. The 
values of C-V hysteresis near flat-band of samples are shown in the Table 1. As can be seen from 
the figure and table, there is remarkable improvement of the C-V hysteresis, from 810 mV to 40 
mV when the temperatures increased from 400

the negative shift of flat-band voltage with the increase of PDA temperatures from 400

The C-V hysteresis was significant increased and the flat-band voltage showed positive shift 
again when the PDA temperature was up to 550

C due to the significant increase of In-oxides.

(3) Capacitance increase by replacing Pr6O11 to HfO2 as gate oxide on InXGa1­XAs  
To investigate the capacitance increasing by replacing Pr6O11 to HfO2 on InGaAs channel, 
two type oxides with the same thickness were grown on In0.7Ga0.3As channel. Fig. 3-1 shows the 
C-V curve of these two devices. The accumulation capacitance was arising apparently in Pr6O11 
applied sample. The inversion phenomenon was not clear, which may due to high interface traps.

Fig. 3-2 compares the capacitance-voltage characteristic of Pr6O11(10nm)/In0.53Ga0.47As 
devices annealed at 450, 500 and 550
0
C. The accumulation capacitance of 450
0
C annealed device 
showed almost no saturation. The transition from accumulation to depletion was not very sharp, 
indicating poor interface quality. After increasing annealing temperature to 500
0
C, the transition 
became conspicuous, and the accumulation capacitance began to saturate, but the inversion 
behavior still not very apparent as compared to former device using HfO2, indicating Fermi level 
pinning at the oxide/semiconductor interface. The 550
0
C annealed device showed inversion 
behavior, which we speculate that the Fermi level was unpinned. The deep-depletion 
phenomenon of 550
0
C annealed sample could be explained that more oxide charges (including 
fix oxide charges and oxide trap charges) were generated during high temperature annealing, 
which caused large hysteresis as compared to the 500
0
C annealed device, which is shown in the 
inset of Fig. 3-2 (b). The other possible explanation for the deep-depletion phenomenon in the 
550
0
C device could be in the microstructure view. Fig. 3-3 shows the TEM image of the 550
0
C 
annealed device, the oxide is neither single-crystalline nor amorphous, but poly-crystalline type, 
which provided leakage current paths for the minority carriers. Since the minority carriers tunnel 
through the oxide to the gate electrode, the inversion layer could not form [1]. Again, the 
depletion region will continue to increase to maintain charge balance when keep biasing the 
device, which resulting in deep-depletion. 
From the discussion, we expect that the accumulation capacitance could increase if 
single-crystalline of amorphous type Pr6O11 could be grown for better insulation capability.

(4) Electrical Characteristics of HfO2 and La2O3 Gate Dielectrics for n-In0.53Ga0.47As MOS 
Structure 
InGaAs MOS capasitor were fabricated on a n-type In0.53Ga0.47As substrate, epitaxially 
grown on a n-type InP substrate. (Si dopant density was 5х1017cm-3). After chemical cleaning 
with acetone and ethanol, followed by HF dipping, either HfO2 or La2O3 were deposited by 
electron-beam deposition in an ultra high vacuum at a pressure of 10
-8
 Pa. Prior to aluminum 
metal gate deposition, post deposition annealing (PDA) was conducted in forming gas (H2:3%, 
N2:97%) at 600
0
C. Finally, Al back contacts were formed. 
Fig. 4-1 shows the gate leakage current  characteristics (Jg-Vg) of the fabricated capacitors; 
HfO2 single layer, La2O3 single layer and La2O3/HfO2 stacking. La2O3 capacitor showed large 
value among the three MOS capacitor, whereas suppressed Jg can be obtained HfO2 or stacked 
film. Fig. 4-2 shows the C-V characteristics of these three MOS capacitors. La2O3 capacitor 
performed a large capacitance value than HfO2 one, however, a large dispersion in capacitance 
value was observed. La2O3/HfO2 stacked capacitor showed large capacitance as well as small 
frequency dispersion. InGaAs MOS capacitors with HfO2 and La2O3 gate dielectrics have been 
investigated. A large leakage current with La2O3 can be suppressed by La2O3/HfO2 stacking. A 
large capacitance value with small frequency dispersion can be obtained with La2O3/ HfO2 
stacking.

Fig. 5-2 TEM images and EDX of the 9 (nm) HfO2 n-In0.7Ga0.3As MOS capacitor 
Thus direct deposition of CeO2 on n-In0.7Ga0.3As layer will caused Iinterdififfusion of these 
two materials. Therefore, a diffusion barrier layer of Pr6O11 with k value of 32 and energy band 
gap of 5.5 (eV) was used to prevent In, Ga and As diffusion into CeO2. Meanwhile keep high k 
value for the dielectric stack, two steps PDA process was used to achieve the optima performance 
for the Ce6O2/Pr6O11 n-InXGa1-XAs MOS capacitors. Fig. 5-3 shows the C-V characteristics of 
CeO2 (6nm)/Pr6O11(4nm) on n-In0.53Ga0.47As MOS capacitor. The first step PDA was performed 
after Pr6O11 deposition at 600
0
C to reduce the native oxide on oxide-semiconductor interface. The 
second step PDA was 400
0
C and was performed after CeO2 deposition to improve the CeO2 
quality and to avoid Pr6O11 interaction with CeO2. PDA at 600
0
C after Pr6O11 deposition 
effectively reduce native oxide thickness and increase the capacitance for the 
CeO2(6nm)/Pr6O11(4nm) n-In0.53Ga0.47As MOS capacitor. However, PDA at higher temperature 
will result in the interdiffusion of Pr6O11 and n-In0.53Ga0.47As materials.

(6)  Effects of Wet Chemical and Trimethyl Aluminum Treatments on the 
Interface Properties  in Atomic Layer Deposition of  Al 2O3  on InAs 
The samples used in this study were a molecular beam epitaxy grown 
n-InAs/In0.7Ga0.3As/In0.53Ga0.47As (5х10
17
/cm
3
 doping) structure on n-InP wafers. After 
degreasing in acetone and iso-propanol, the native-oxide-covered samples were loaded into an 
atomic layer deposition (ALD) chamber. In situ trimethyl aluminum (TMA) pretreatments was 
done by using 1, 5, and 10 cycles of TMA/N2 (half ALD cycles) with a duration of 0.2 s for a 
TMA pulse and 5 s for a N2 pulse. After that, Al2O3 films (TMA/N2/H2O/N2 with periods of 
0.2/5/0.2/5 s) were deposited over 20 growth cycles. The thickness of the Al2O3 ﬁlm estimated 
from the number of growth cycles, is about 2 nm. High-purity N2 was used as a purging gas and 
the wafers were kept at a temperature of 200
0
 C during both pretreatment and deposition 
processes. In addition, two kinds of chemical surface treatments, i.e., HCl treatment and sulﬁde 
[(NH4)2S] treatment were also carried out before 10 cycles of TMA pretreatment and ALD Al2O3 
deposition. 
The HCl treatment was performed for 1min using HCl: H2O (1:10) solution followed by 
rinsing in water for 1min and blowing dry by N2 gas. For (NH4)2S treatment, the samples went 
through HCl treatment ﬁrst, followed by 20min in (NH4)2S: H2O(1:3) solution; after that, the 
samples were rinsed for 1min in water and blown dry by N2 gas. X-ray photoelectron spectrum 
(XPS) measurements were performed in a commercial Microlab 350 XPS system equipped with 
an Al Kα source in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (~109 Torr) with a 600 takeoﬀ angle. 
The MOS capacitance (MOSCAP) structures were fabricated on untreated, HCl-treated, and 
sulﬁde-treated samples with 10 half cycles of TMA pretreatment followed by 10 nm ALD Al2O3 
deposition at 200
0
C. Postdeposition annealing (PDA) was performed at 400
0
 C for 30 s in N2. 
After that, Ti/Pt/Au gate metal and Au/Ge/Ni/Au backside ohmic metal were deposited, followed 
by postmetal annealing (PMA) at 400
0
 C for 30 s in N2. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) and 
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using an HP4284A LCR meter and a 
Keithley 4200 semiconductor analyzer system, respectively.

Fig. 6-2. (Color online) XPS As 3d and In 3d5/2 spectra of 
InAs samples after (a) HCl and (b) (NH4)2S treatments 
and the wet-chemical- treated samples after 10 cycles of 
TMA pretreatment followed by 20 cycles of ALD Al2O3 
[(c) and (d)]. 
Figure 6-2 shows the As 3d3/2,5/2 and In 3d5/2 XPS spectra of the InAs surface after diﬀerent 
wet chemical treatments [Figs. 6-2(a) and 6-2(b)] and after wet chemical treatments followed by 
10 cycles of TMA pretreatment and ~2 nm Al2O3 deposition [Figs. 6-2(c) and 6-2(d)]. The 
(NH4)2S-treated surface shows the same chemical species as the HCl-treated surface but with an 
additional peak in the As 3d spectrum at~1.6 eV above the As-bulk peak, which is assigned to 
As–S bonds.2) The peak separation between In–O and In–S is very small (~ 0:1 to 0.2 eV),2) 
thus, it is diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate these two bonds from the In 3d5/2 spectrum. As shown in Figs. 
6-2(a) and 6-2(b), the reduction of As2O5 bonding to below the detection level of XPS was 
observed after both kinds of surface treatments. Moreover, the As2O3 oxide signal could not be 
detected in the sulﬁde-treated sample and was signiﬁcantly reduced in the HCl-treated sample. 
From these results, it is clearly seen that the As-related oxides were eﬀectively reduced when 
subjected to chemical surface treatment compared with samples with pure TMA pretreatment 
only. Although the reduction of In–O (S) bonds was not as eﬀective as that of As–O bonds in 
both chemical surface treatments, these bonds decreased in number by approximately 40% 
compared with those by the TMA pretreatment. 
Figures 6-2(c) and 6-2(d) show the As 3d3/2, 5/2 and In 3d5/2 spectra of the 
wet-chemical-treated samples following 10 cycles of TMA treatment and 2 nm ALD Al2O3 
deposition. The residual As2O3 after HCl treatment was removed by the TMA pretreatment as 
shown in Fig. 6-2(c). In the sulﬁde-treated sample, after the TMA pretreatment, the As–S 
bonding was also reduced as indicated in Fig. 6-2(d). The results imply that the combination of 
chemical treatments and TMA pretreatment may be an eﬀective way to remove native oxides. 
Figure 6-3 shows the multiple-frequency C–V characteristics of the MOSCAP structures as 
well as the corresponding bidirectional C–V responses at a frequency of 1MHz. The frequency 
dispersion in the accumulation and depletion regions is relatively low for all samples, i.e., <2.3% 
perdecade in accumulation. Moreover, the C–V hysteresis near the ﬂat band voltage was also 
small (≦100mV) as shown in Fig. 6-3. This indicates a low Dit within the upper half of the InAs 
band gap. In the inversion region, a “low-frequency＂ C–V response is observed at a 
26 
 
smaller frequency dispersion in the inversion region, as shown in Figs. 6-3 and 6-4(a). The 
Jg–V curves of samples are shown in Fig. 6-4(b). The leakage current density in the 
HCl-treated sample is the smallest (≦2 х 106 A·cm2) and is 2 orders lower than that of the 
other samples (≦2 х 104 A·cm2) within 2V gate bias range. The leakage current is aﬀected 
by interface-trap-assisted tunneling and/or interface-induced conductance band oﬀset 
lowering between the high-k and III–V compounds. 11) A lower leakage current implies a 
smaller eﬀect of interface trap. This indicates that a better Al2O3/InAs interface quality was 
achieved by HCl treatment plus TMA pretreatment. The interface trap densitiesnear the 
middle of the gap are about 4 × 1012, 2 ×1012, and 2.5 ×1012 eV1 · cm2 for the 
pure-TMA-treated, HCl-plus-TMA-treated and sul ﬁ de-plus-TMA-treated samples, 
respectively, as determined by Hill’s method.12)

(8) Capacitance Enhancement by CeO2 / HfO2 Composite High k Dielectrics for InXGa1-XAs 
MOS Capacitor 
The MOS structure used in this study is as shown in Figure 8-1. For the MOS capacitor 
fabrication, the InGaAs/InP epitaxial wafers used were first cleaned in the 50% HF solution 
for 3 minutes, followed by 30 minutes dipping in the (NH4)2S solution at room temperature. 
Then, the wafers were loaded into the MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) system for HfO2 
(5nm) and CeO2 (10nm) depositions. The deposition temperature was 300
0
C, and after each 
deposition, the wafers went through PDA at 400
0
C. After PDA, W (tungsten) was deposited 
on the wafer by sputtering as gate contact metal. Finally, Au (gold) was deposited by 
sputtering on the backside of the n+ InP substrates to form Ohmic contacts.

For the MOS capacitor fabrication, the interface trap density of the capacitor usually can 
be reduced by PDA process. However, when the low energy band gap CeO2 is in direct 
contact with InXGa1-XAs material, In, Ga and As elements tend to diffuse into CeO2 after PDA 
process. Figure 8-2 (a), (b) shows the C-V characteristics of the 9 nm CeO2 on n-In0.7Ga0.3As 
MOS capacitors with PDA temperatures at 400
0
C and 500
0
C, respectively. The capacitance 
increased rapidly when the frequency is low (especially for 1kHz), this was caused by the 
high trap density at the oxide /semiconductor interface caused by In, Ga and As diffusion into 
CeO2 after PDA process [1]. Compared with 400
0
C annealing, 500
0
C annealing caused more 
serious interdiffusion between InGaAs and oxide, and the capacitance of MOS capacitor at 
lower frequency as shown in Figure 8-2 (b).

spectroscopy (EDX) for the 9nm CeO2 on n-In0.7Ga0.3As structure after PDA at 500
0
C is 
shown in Figure 8-3. The TEM image shows around 5 (nm) crystalline CeO2 layer on top of 4 
(nm) amorphous CeO2 layer on n-In0.7Ga0.3As. EDX data indicates that certain In, Ga and As 
atoms out-diffused into CeO2 especially in the 4 (nm) amorphous layer. The 4(nm) 
amorphous CeO2 layer formed on top of n-In0.7Ga0.3As may be caused by the interaction 
between CeO2 and InGaAs.

p-In0.7Ga0.3As MOS capacitors, respectively. It can be seen clearly that there is frequency 
dispersion in the accumulation region. The frequency dispersion may be caused by the thin 
layer formed at the interface, which has relatively low resistivity [5]. On the other hand, 
Figure 4-6 shows capacitance compression in accumulation region at low frequency when the 
bias voltage was increased, the lower energy band gap of InAs also results in higher leakage 
current.

(9) An Al2O3 AlGaAs/InGaAs Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor PHEMT SPDT Switch with Low 
Control Currents for Wireless Communication Applications 
In this study, ALD Al2O3 with a high dielectric constant (8.6-10) and a high breakdown field 
(5~10 MV/cm) was used as high-κ material for AlGaAs/InGaAs MOS-PHEMT switches [1]. The 
major requirements for good RF switch are low insertion loss, high isolation, high power 
handling capability and low control current [2]. To achieve low control current, the methods 
include reducing the gate current and the size of devices. The MOS-PHEMT switches with extra 
high resistance between control electrode and signal path provide good isolation and results in 
much lower control current as compared to conventional PHEMT switches. 
The MOS-PHEMT switches were grown on semi-insulating GaAs substrates by MOCVD. 
The sketch of the MOS-PHEMT cross section is shown in Fig. 9-1(a). The structure, from bottom 
to top, is comprised of a 600 nm buffer, a 13 nm undoped In0.2Ga0.8As channel, a 3 nm undoped 
Al0.25Ga0.75As spacer, a delta-doped layer, a 37 nm undoped Al0.25Ga0.75As barrier layer, a 1.5 nm 
AlAs etch-stop layer and a 60 nm n
+
-GaAs cap layer. 
The switches use dual-fingers 0.5 μm gate length MOS-PHEMT. Its processing includes the 
following steps: mesa isolation, wet chemical recess, oxide deposition, Ohmic formation, gate 
formation, interconnect metallization, and passivation. The mesa isolation was achieved by 
H3PO4/H2O2/H2O solution. The n
+
-GaAs cap layer was selectively etched by citric 
acid/H2O2/H2O solution with AlAs layer as etch stop layer. The AlAs layer was removed by 
HCl(10 %) solution. Then, the AlGaAs was treated with (NH4)2Sx at 60 ℃ for 30 mins before 
Al2O3 deposition [3]. (NH4)2Sx treatment before ALD Al2O3 deposition can reduce the interface 
trap density between oxide and semiconductor and form a thin layer 5 ± 1 Å  of sulfide on the 
surface [4], which results in further reduction of device leakage current. After (NH4)2Sx treatment, 
16 nm Al2O3 was deposited at 300 ℃ as gate dielectric by ALD and was annealed at 500 ℃ for 
60 s in forming gas. Ohmic contacts were Au/Ge/Ni/Au and were annealed at 410 ℃ for 30 s. 
Ti/Pt/Au gate metal was formed on Al2O3 layer. PECVD silicon nitride was used as the dielectric 
layer for the capacitors and for final passivation. The interconnect metals are comprised of a Ti/Pt 
adhesion layer with 2 μm plated gold. 
 
 
 
34 
 
on-state resistance (VDS = 0.5 V, VGS = 0 V) of 3.75 Ω．mm, the threshold voltage Vth of -0.98 V, 
and the peak extrinsic transconductance of 248 mS/mm (VDS = 2 V) were achieved for 
MOS-PHEMT. As shown in Fig. 9-3, the MOS-PHEMT with the Al2O3 gate dielectrics 
demonstrated much lower gate current as compared to the conventional PHEMT [5-6]. Therefore, 
it appears that the application of Al2O3 gate dielectric for MOS-PHEMT can obtain the 
comparable DC performance and effectively lower the gate leakage current for the switch 
application.

As exhibited in Fig. 9-4, the MOS-PHEMT switch has an insertion loss of 0.3 dB, an 
isolation of 33.4 dB, and a return loss of 18.5 dB (control voltage = +3/0 V, input power = 0 dBm) 
at 2.5 GHz. The RF characteristics of the MOS-PHEMT switches were comparable to those of 
the PHEMT switches. The small deviations of the RF results from these two switches were 
primarily due to the insertion of Al2O3 gate dielectric. 
Fig. 9-5(a) shows the MOS-PHEMT switches had comparable input P1dB of 31.4 dBm at 2.5 
GHz as compared to PHEMT switches. Considering the switch power limitation, the maximum 
input power is described as:

where Z0 is the line impedance, Vth the threshold voltage, and Vc the absolute control voltage 
[7-9]. The input P1dB for switches with and without Al2O3 were identical because the Vth shift was 
very small (Vth, MOS-PHEMT= -0.98 V, PHEMT= -1 V). Based on Equation 1 above and the 
test results, it can be seen that the power handling capability was closely related to the threshold 
characteristics, and Al2O3 did not affect the power handling capability. Fig. 9-5(b) compares the

The AlGaAs/InGaAs MOS-PHEMT SPDT switch with ALD Al2O3 gate dielectric was 
fabricated for the first time. Gate current was improved as compared to the conventional PHEMT. 
The RF characteristics of the MOS-PHEMT switch exhibited an insertion loss of 0.3 dB, an 
isolation of 33.4 dB, a return loss of 18.5 dB, and a high input P1dB of 31.4 dBm at 2.5 GHz. 
Much lower control current of less than 10 μA when biased from 1.5 V to 5 V was achieved. It’s 
evident that MOS-PHEMT can be used for MMIC switch applications with excellent RF 
performance and low DC power consumption.

技術說明
(中文) 本技術研究藉由沈積新穎的高介電值氧化物介電層La2O3，以改善元件之EOT值，
但由於La2O3高介電值材料之低能間隙特性，易造成半導體與氧化物層間之相互
作用，造成層間界面的不穩定性與半導體元件的電性失效，因此本實驗利用HfO2
作為La2O3的擴散阻擋層，以抑制La2O3與三五族複合物基板間的相互擴散，亦可
更進一步提昇半導體元件金屬-氧化物-半導體元件之EOT。 
本報告欲保護的專利範圍，包括: 
1.將氧化鑭/氧化鉿(La2O3/HfO2)的氧化物複合層技術應用於砷化銦三五族複合
物半導體元件金屬-氧化物-半導體電容結構。 
2.藉由使用氧化鉿(HfO2)當作擴散阻擋層，抑制高介電係數之氧化層如氧化鑭
(La2O3)、氧化鈰(CeO2)等與三五族複合物半導體基板間的相互擴散。 
(英文) In this patent，a brand new high dielectric constant oxide La2O3 was used to 
improvement EOT for FET devices. However, the lower energy bandgap of La2O3 will 
result in interdiffusion on between semiconductor and oxide layer, and the device failure. 
Therefore, in this patent, we supply the technique that is using HfO2 as barrier layer to 
avoid the inter-reaction between semiconductor and La2O3 and hence improve EOT for 
device.
