Abstract: In this project, a systematic procedure is proposed for the generalized design of decoupling 
multivariable controller, which may result in a complete decoupling, partial decoupling or no decoupling, 
to achieve a better disturbance rejection response. Before the decoupling, a relative load gain (abbr. RLG) 
is defined to determine which control loops need to be decoupled and which control loops don’t. By a 
transitional design matrix and its adjoint matrix, a completely or partially inverse-based multi-input-multi-
output (MIMO) decoupler with generalized form is presented to decouple the process into the specified 
open-loop process. This decoupled open-loop process is further decomposed into several equivalent single-
loop systems, equivalent open-loop processes and disturbances. Finally, the controller can be synthesized 
based on each equivalent system for disturbance rejection. Stability robustness of the system is tuned with 
measures for the modeling errors in the decoupled open-loop process. Simulation examples are illustrated 
to show that this proposed method is effective for disturbance rejection in MIMO systems. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Most chemical plants belong to multi-input-multi-output 
(MIMO) processes having multiple delays. The main 
characteristic of MIMO process is interaction existence 
between loops and that leads to difficult use for the 
conventional SISO controllers. Because of this, many 
methods have been developed to construct multivariable 
control systems. Lots of them intend to make the system 
strictly or roughly dominated by diagonal elements or to 
reduce the effect from loop interactions. In general, these 
multivariable controllers are considered to have better control 
ability than multi-loop SISO controllers. However, 
Niederlinski (1971) reveals that multiloop SISO controllers 
may give better load rejection than inverse-based 
multivariable controllers for some cases. To analyze 
differences of load responses between multi-loop SISO 
controllers and inverse-based multivariable controllers, 
Stanley et al. (1985) proposed the relative disturbance gain 
(RDG) which is defined as a ratio of the manipulated variable 
under perfect control at steady-state and single-loop control. 
Actually, the control structure that has superior ability for 
disturbance rejection may be neither the multi-loop SISO 
controller nor inverse-based multivariable controller (Chang 
and Yu, 1992; Fragervik et al., 1983). It can be any structure, 
for example, partial decoupling, that is a structure between 
two extreme cases. Some forms of partial decoupling have 
been proposed such as block diagonal decoupling (Linneman 
and Wang, 1993) and triangular decoupling (Gómez and 
Goodwin, 2000). Most of them only discuss the delay-free 
systems which seldom exist in chemical processes. Although 
some one-way decoupling methods (Fragervik et al., 1983; 
Arkun et al., 1984) can be easily applied to TITO systems 
having multiple delays, they are difficult to extend to higher 
dimensional systems. Besides, most methods only pick on 
one control structure and lack a criterion to select a proper 
structure. 
In this project, a systematic procedure is proposed to design 
the multivariable controller with generalized form to perform 
well disturbance rejection. A relative load gain (RLG) is 
defined to determine the decoupling structure even for the 
partial decoupling case. Moreover, RLG has explicit physical 
meaning and direct connection to control performance. A 
method is proposed to design the generalized decoupling that 
could be a complete decoupling, partial decoupling or non-
decoupling. Furthermore, measures of modeling error are 
given to facilitate the analysis of system robustness. 
2. GENERALIZED DESIGN OF DECOUPLING 
A multivariable control scheme with unity feedback loop is 
shown in Fig. 1. To control this MIMO system, two common 
methods are usually used. One is the complete decoupling 
(i.e. the inverse-based multivariable control) that results a 
fully controller ( )K s  and inverse-based decoupler ( )D s . 
The other is non-decoupling (i.e. the decentralized control) 
that brings ( )K s  decentralized and ( )D s  identity. Consider 
a n n´  system as the following: 
 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )LY s G s U s G s l s= +  (1) 
where, ( )Y s  and ( )U s  designate the output and input 
vectors, ( )l s  and ( )LG s  represent the load and its transfer 
function vector (abbr. TFV), and ( )G s  is the process transfer 
function matrix (abbr. TFM). Both ( )G s  and ( )LG s  are 
open-loop stable. The objective of generalized decoupling is 
to remove loop interactions in some loops but to remain them 
 
 
     
 
magnitude in the output is proportional to the load gain of the 
system during this period. Thus, RLG is closely linked to the 
control performance. From the definition in (7), RLG can be 
computed as: 
 
(0)

g k
g k
g = =  (8) 
where Lik  and Lik  are the gains of ( )Lig s  and ( )Lig s , 
respectively. ( )Lig s  is defined as the effective disturbance 
that means the total effect of load input to the ith loop when 
all loops except i are closed. In order to derive the ( )Lig s , the 
matrices in (1) are first permuted and partitioned into the 
following forms:

Then, the effective disturbance of the ith loop is given as: 
( ){ }1 1( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )12 22 22 2 2i i i i iLi Li C Lg g G G I I G G G- -= - - +é ùë û  (10) 
The RLG can be applied to determine that the loop favours to 
be decoupled or not. Furthermore, the outputs that have their 
absolute value of ig  more than one can be suggested to be 
decoupled so MISO controllers are used here. On the other 
hand, 1ig £ , these loops favour to use SISO controllers. 
The selection of controllers can be based on the following 
criterion: 
1;  MISO controller is preferred for 
1;  SISO controller  is preferred for 
i i

Notice that, if both SISO and MISO controller are needed in 
an MIMO process, the controller needed will be a partial 
decoupling controller. 
3.2 Design of ( )D s

specified by the following criteria:

where , ( )iA s· , , ( )oiG s· , and , ( )iI s·  designate the ith rows 
of ( )A s , ( )oG s , and a unit matrix I , respectively. To 
implement ( )D s  of (5), each ( )ijA s  is reduced to a simpler 
transfer function, that is,

where n and p are the number of first order leads and lags 
respectively and they obey the inequality of 2 0p n+ - > . 
The parameters in the model of (12) can be obtained by 
solving the following optimization problem:

g i r i p pd t t t tP , fw  is a frequency band 
which is chosen as ten times frequency bandwidth of ( )ijA s . 
In order to make each element of ( )D s  realizable, a number 
of excess zeros of  ( )iz s  is given as the following: 
 { }[ ( )] min [ ( )],  1,2,...,ez epi jiN z s N s j nf= =  (14) 
where [ ( )]ep jiN sf   is the number of excess poles in   ( )ji sf . 
From (6), the dynamics of decoupled parts in ( )Q s  are 
dominated by { }11det oG . According to that, the decoupled 
loop in the proposed design can be obtained by a simpler 
expression as the following:

Similarly, the parameters in (16) can be obtained by solving 
the optimization problem as in (13) except that ( )sj  and 
( )w s  are instead of ˆ ijA  and ( )ijA s . fw  is chosen as ten 
times frequency bandwidth of ( )w s . Then, by re-allocate the 
pole(s) and zero(s) in ( )sj , ( )iz s  provides the availability 
to modify undesirable dynamic characteristics in ( )w s , and 
thus can improve the dynamics resulting from some large 
time constants or excessive lags. The decoupler ( )D s  is thus 
implemented via the transfer functions of the following:

4. STABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS 
Assume that m loops are decoupled in an arbitrary n n´  
system, where [ ]1, 2, ,m nÎ K . For convenient analysis, the 
loops the have been decoupled are permuted to the forehead 
loops of the system, hence the open-loop process ( )Q s  and 
the controller ( )C s  are rewritten as the following:

where [ ]1 1,diag iiC c= , [ ]2 2,diag jjC c= , [ ]11 11,diag iiQ q= , 
[ ]21 21, jiQ q=  and [ ]22 22 , jjQ q=  for all [ ]1, 2,...,i mÎ  and 
[ ]1, 2,...,j m m nÎ + + . According to the proposed design, 
the control scheme in Fig. 1 can be regarded as an equivalent 
multivariable control scheme as shown in Fig. 2 that 
conjugates a multivariable decentralized control system with 
some single-loop control systems. Because each element of 
the process ( )G s  in (1) is an open-loop stable function, the 
decoupled open-loop process ( )Q s  in (19) and the 
generalized decoupler in (17) are designed to be open-loop 
stable. Under the conjunctive framework in Fig. 2, the 
stability of the system can be individually discussed by two 
steps: one is 1 ( )C s  stabilizes a diagonal system 11 ( )Q s  and 
the other is 2 ( )C s  stabilizes a full system 22 ( )Q s . However, 
the approximation of ( )D s  in (17) leads to the existence of 
modeling error in the desired process ( )Q s . Thus, the 
nominal stability of the proposed control scheme in Fig. 1 is 
guaranteed by designing ( )C s  to satisfy the following 
conditions: 
(1) ( )C s  stabilizes ( )Q s  in a simple closed loop. 
(a) 1, ( )iic s  stabilizes 11, ( )iiq s  for all [ ]1, 2,...,i mÎ . 
(b) 2, 22 ,1 ( ) ( ) 0ii E ic s q s+ =  has no RHP zero, and 22 , ( )E iq s  
has no RHP pole for all [ ]1, 2,...,i m m nÎ + + .

 where 22 ,E iq  is the effective process of 22Q , and s  
denotes the largest singular value.  
 
Due to approximation made in (12), ( ) ( )G s D s  may not 
equal to ( )Q s  exactly. As a result, a model error (i.e. ( )Q sD ) 
originating from this approximation can be estimated by the 
index ije  of (18) in the frequency range of concerned for 
nominal stability, and then the second condition can easily be

( )G s , consider the control system has an additive uncertain, 
where the real process is presented as: 
 ( ) ( ) ( )G s G s s= + D%  ;     ( ( )) ( )j js w wD £ l  (28) 
where the perturbation ( )sD  is bounded on ( )jwl . And, the 
system will be robust stable iff:

where

Thus, by selecting an adequate , ( )E ih s , the controller ( )ic s  
is synthesized also to satisfy the robust stability in (28).
