was distributed within the α matrix [10]. 
 
2. Experimental 
The present study therefore focuses on 
the corrosion behavior of Ti6Al4V treated 
with the THP. The effects of grain 
refinement and α2 phase formation resulting 
from the THP treatment are examined. The 
starting material for the THP was Ti6Al4V 
ELI alloy [10]. Prior to the THP treatment, 
the samples used in this study were 
subjected to β-solution treatment at 1000oC 
in vacuum for 0.5h, followed by furnace 
cooling [10]. A Sievert’s volumetric 
apparatus [11] was used for the THP 
treatment. The effective hydrogen pressure 
was calculated via the ideal gas law, and the 
amount of hydrogen dissolved in the 
specimen was then calculated by a 
volumetric method where a resolution of 
8x10-6 mole of hydrogen in the specimen 
could be obtained. In order to control the 
different microstructures, two 
hydrogenation treatments were conducted at 
different temperatures and hydrogen 
loadings, and subsequently dehydrogenation 
was carried out in vacuum at proper 
temperatures for 1 or 2h, followed by air 
cooling in about 0.5h to room temperature. 
There was no residual hydrogen left in the 
dehydrogenated specimens [10]. The 
specimen conditions are given in Table 1. 
The phases were determined by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. 
Microstructural characterization was carried 
out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, 
JEOL-5410 and JEOL-6500F) and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 
FEI G2).  
Prior to the electrochemical test, the 
sample was sealed in epoxy resin with an 
exposed area of 1.13cm2. The sample was 
then ground and polished to obtain a strain 
free surface. The potential dynamic 
polarization test was conducted using 0.15M 
NaCl solution as the electrolyte for 
assessment of corrosion resistance of 
bio-materials for human body [12]. This 
standard is adopted for corrosion evaluation 
for potential applications in hip prosthesis. 
The electrolyte was deaerated with N2 
during the entire test. An electrochemical 
cell fitted with three electrodes, a working 
electrode, a reference electrode (saturated 
calomel electrode, SCE) and a platinum 
counter electrode, was employed for the 
electrochemical experiment. The 
electrochemical measurement was 
performed using a potentiostat of Solartron 
1287A electrochemical interface. 
 
3.Results and Discussion 
The XRD patterns of Ti6Al4V with 
different treatments are presented in Figure 
1. The XRD pattern of the β-solution treated 
specimen shows very different relative peak 
intensities from those of standard pattern, 
indicating a strong texture [10]. After the 
THP treatment, the peak positions of α 
phase in specimen A are similar to those in 
the β-solution treated specimen. However, a 
shift of β phase peaks to the lower angle 
was observed, indicating that a high internal 
stress existed in specimen A. Based on the 
shift, the expansion in lattice parameter is 
approximately 2.2%, i.e., a volume 
 4
treated specimen, consistent with those 
reported previously [25-27]. However, a 
significant decrease in corrosion resistance 
is observed for both specimens A and B, 
particularly at 80oC. With regard to 
specimen A, the α matrix is considerably 
refined. As a result, the area of grain 
boundaries is increased, leading to poorer 
corrosion resistance than the β-solution 
treated specimen at higher temperatures [16, 
17]. For specimen B, the existence of α2 
phase within the α matrix further enhances 
such galvanic corrosion due to its higher 
concentration of Al than in the α matrix 
[20-23]. This suggests that the α2 phase 
formed during the THP is detrimental to the 
corrosion resistance of Ti6Al4V and needs 
to be eliminated. Specimen B possibly 
exhibits better ductility for fabrication, but 
its lower strength and worse corrosion 
resistance would exclude its application for 
bio-implantation. The reason why the 
corrosion resistance of specimens A and B is 
so sensitive to the high temperature is not 
clear and requires further study. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In summary, this study examined the 
corrosion resistance of Ti6Al4V after the 
THP treatment. With grain refinement, 
specimen A exhibits higher hardness and 
comparable corrosion resistance at 37oC. It 
may have better performance when used as 
a bio-implant material. Both A and B show 
decreased corrosion resistance at 65oC and 
80oC, that might be ascribed to the increased 
grain boundaries and α2 precipitates.

Recently, a uniform and different thickness of inert layer, alumina, has been coated on GaQ3 
nanowires by using ALD process as shown in Fig. 2 [13]. The outer layer, alumina, can be well 
controlled by the cycle number.  In this study, different thicknesses of alumina layer were coated 
on GaQ3 nanowires by ALD.  The degradation time of photoluminescence of the core-shell 
nanowires was examined in different atmospheres at different temperatures.

The sample holder includes a heater, a thermocouple, a copper plate and a thin aluminum foil. 
The sample was pasted between the copper plate and holder. A heater was attached on the plate. A 
thermocouple was placed in the hole of the copper plate. After the sample and heater were fixed, a 
thin aluminum foil was screwed up to fix the position as shown in Fig. 4.

3. Gas sources 
Except water vapor, all gases from the cylinder tank were used. The gas flow was controlled by 
an MFC. Water vapor was produced by heating water in a constant temperature water bath and 
carried by argon to the box as shown in Fig. 5. Table. 1 shows the humidity in the box with different 
purging time. With the purging time exceeding 90min, the humidity became nearly saturated. 
 
 
III. Experimental procedures 
1. Photoluminescence measurement of GaQ3 nanowires in argon and oxygen at different 
temperatures 
Argon and oxygen were used to purge the box. The gas flow was controlled at 500 sccm by an 
MFC. In the beginning, the gas was purged into the box for 10 min to remove the residual gas. After 
10 min, the heater was turned on. As soon as the temperature reached 80°C, the measurement was 
begun and lasted for 30 min for each run. The total measurement time was 210 min. 
2. Photoluminescence measurement of nanostructure in water vapor at different temperatures 
Water vapor was produced by heating water in a water bath at 40°C. The flow rate of argon, 
used as carrier gas, was 1000 sccm.   
IV. Results   
1. Photoluminescence spectra of the GaQ3 and GaQ3-Al2O3 core-shell nanowires in different 
gases at room temperature and 80°C 
Figs. 6 and 7 show the photoluminescence spectra of the GaQ3 and GaQ3-Al2O3 core-shell 
nanowires, respectively, in different gases at room temperature. The peak emission wavelengths of 
the nanowires in different gases are the same, 520nm, for both pure and core-shell nanowires. 
However, the emission wavelengths of GaQ3 and GaQ3-Al2O3 core-shell nanowires at 80°C in 
different gases show a 6nm blue shift compared to those at RT, as shown in Fig. 8 for GaQ3 
nanowires in argon.  The blue shift may be due to the heat to excite the higher level of molecular 
vibration. More detailed investigation of this part will be done in the future.

2. Stability of photoluminescence of GaQ3 and core-shell GaQ3-Al2O3 nanowires in argon at 
different temperatures 
There is no difference between the emission wavelengths of GaQ3 and core-shell nanowires in 
argon at room temperature. The emission wavelengths are all located at 520nm. The stability plot 
shows no much degradation among these nanostructures up to 180 min, as shown in Fig. 9. It 
indicates that argon could be a good protector for organic nanostructures. However, all the samples 
were degraded very much at 80°C in the beginning. The GaQ3 nanowires coated with 200 cycles of 
alumina shows slightly better protection than the others at 80°C in argon as shown Fig.10. There is 
no much difference between low cycle-number coatings and uncoated nanowires at 80°C.  
 
3. Stability of photoluminescence of GaQ3 and GaQ3-Al2O3 core-shell nanowires in air at 
different temperatures  
Fig. 11 shows the stability of GaQ3 nanowires with different shell thicknesses in air at room 
temperature. Only uncoated GaQ3 nanowires were degradated. No degradation is observed among 
the other core-shell nanowires, even with only 50 cycles of coating. TEM image shows that the 
thickness of nanowires coated with 50cycles is about 1.7nm. It means that only with this thickness 
of the alumina outer layer can well prevent GaQ3 nanowires from reacting with air.  Fig. 12 shows 
the results for core-shell organic nanostructures tested in air at 80°C. Right in the beginning, the 
degradation of all nanostructures occurs, although the GaQ3 nanowires with 200 cycles coating have 
a slightly better stability.  After 30min, the photoluminescence intensity of the nanowires becomes 
stable.  
 4. Stability of photoluminescence of GaQ3 nanowires in oxygen at different temperatures  
Fig. 13 shows the degradation of GaQ3 nanowires with different cycle numbers of coating at 
room temperature. All the nanowires were degraded in oxygen as time increased. Before 120 min, 
the degradation is proportional to the cycle number. As the cycle number increases, the degradation 
decreases. The degradation rate of nanowires coated with 200 cycles of alumina is the slowest in all 
samples. After 120 min, the degradation of the nanowires with 50 cycles of coating suddenly 
dropped. The degradation rate is even faster than that of the uncoated nanowires.  At 80°C, more 
significant degradation of the nanowires can be observed as shown in Fig. 14, although 200 cycles 
of coating shows a better stability.
