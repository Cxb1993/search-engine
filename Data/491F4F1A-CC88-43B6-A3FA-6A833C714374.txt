in [1]. We also propose an ML decoding algorithm for
NBC-MPSK. The proposed ML algorithm is modiﬁed
from the A* decoding of linear block codes in [10]-[11].
Error performance and complexity of various decoding
algorithms is compared by simulations.
The NBC-MPSK scheme was generalized to multiple-
antenna systems in [2], called noncoherent space-time
block-coded MPSK. Using this scheme, good unitary
space-time codes [12],[13] can be designed. Herein, for
this scheme, we propose a new signal set with set par-
titioning and use the proposed ML decoding algorithm
to obtain satisfactory error peformance.

A．Review of Noncoherent Block-coded
MPSK
For the convenience of presentation, the signal constel-
lation considered is 8PSK. However, they can be easily
extended to the cases of M-PSK with M = 8. Con-
sider an 8PSK signal constellation as given in [14], in
which each signal point is labeled by (a, b, c), where
a, b, and c ∈ {0, 1}. By successive two-way partitions
of 8PSK signal set, the intra-subset squared Euclidean
distances are δ2a = 2 −
√
2, δ2b = 2 and δ
2
c = 4 respec-
tively [14]. Let (a1, b1, c1), (a2, b2, c2), · · · , (aN , bN , cN)
be a block of transmitted 8PSK signals with length N .
A multilevel BCM C is designed in such a manner that
ca = (a1, a2, · · · , aN) is a codeword of a binary block
code Ca, cb = (b1, b2, · · · , bN) is a codeword of a binary
block code Cb and cc = (c1, c2, · · · , cN) is a codeword of
a binary block code Cc. Herein, Ci represents the binary
block code used for coding level i, where i ∈ {a, b, c}.
Denote the codeword of C which is composed of ca, cb
and cc by v = (v1, v2, · · · , vN) = ca + 2cb + 4cc.
The ith symbol of the baseband received block r =
(r1, r2, · · · , rN), where i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N}, is given by
ri = ζ
vi ejθ + ni (1)
where ζ is deﬁned by ζ = exp{j2π/M}, ni is an inde-
pendent zero-mean complex Gaussian noise, and θ is an
arbitrary phase shift which is uniformly distributed over
[0, 2π) and assumed to be constant for N consecutive
signals.
At the noncoherent receiver, the ML decoder selects
the codeword vˆ which satisﬁes
vˆ = argmax
v∈C
|(r, ζv)| (2)
where (r, ζv) denotes the complex inner product be-
tween r and ζv, deﬁned by (r, ζv) =
∑N
i=1 riζ
−vi. A
squared noncoherent distance between any two code-
words v and v′ of C is deﬁned by
d2nc(v,v
′) = N − |(ζv, ζv′)|. (3)
The minimum squared noncoherent distance of a code
C, denoted by d2nc, is deﬁned as the minimum value of
d2nc(v,v
′) between any two codewords v and v′ of C
which correspond to diﬀerent information bits [3].
In [1], the minimum squared noncoherent distance of
block-coded MPSK C is shown to be
d2nc = min{N −
√
(N − 2−
√
2
2
dncH,a)2 +
d2ncH,a
2
,
N −
√
(N − dncH,b)2 + d2ncH,b, 2dncH,c} (4)
where dncH,i is the minimum noncoherent Hamming dis-
tance of Ci for i ∈ {a, b, c}, deﬁned as
dncH,i = min{di, N − dmax(Ci)} (5)
in which di denotes the minimum Hamming dis-
tance of Ci and dmax(Ci) denotes the maximum
value of Hamming distance between any two code-
words corresponding to diﬀerent information bits in
Ci. When N → ∞, (4) becomes d2nc = min{((2 −√
2)/2)dncH,a, dncH,b, 2dncH,c}
Noncoherent block-coded MPSK proposed in [1] is
illustrated as follows. Assume that C ′i is an (N, ki +
1, di) binary linear block code with a generator matrix
containing an all-one row. The generator matrix of C ′i
can be represented as G′i =
(
1
Gi
)
where 1 is an all-
one 1 × N matrix and Gi is a ki × N matrix. Let
Ci denote the (N, ki, di) code deﬁned by the generator
matrix Gi for i ∈ {a, b, c}. Note that C ′i = {Ci, Ci⊕ 1}
and dncH,i of Ci is di ∀i ∈ {a, b, c}. Moreover, if C ′i
has the largest minimum Hamming distance di among
all (N, ki + 1) binary linear block codes, then Ci has
the largest minimum noncoherent Hamming distance
dncH,i among all (N, ki) binary linear block codes [1].
Noncoherent block-coded MPSK C is deﬁned as the
BCM whose component codes for coding level a, b and
c are Ca, Cb and Cc respectively. By properly choosing
component codes, we obtained some examples of NBC-
MPSK in [1]. Because three values in the parenthesis
of (4) should be as close as possible, these well-designed
examples have da ≥ db ≥ dc, and thus ka ≤ kb ≤ kc.
Two multistage decoding algorithms for noncoherent
block-coded MPSK were proposed in [1]. The ﬁrst algo-
rithm in [1] is too complicated for the component code
2
bits as ci, where i ∈ {a, b, c}. That is, NBC-MPSK
composed of Ca, Cb and Cc can be viewed as the BCM
composed of C ′a, C
′
b and C
′
c, in which two codewords
ci ∈ Ci and ci ⊕ 1 correspond to the same informa-
tion bits and only ci is used at the transmitter, where
i ∈ {a, b, c}. This provides another explanation of (6)
and (8). By doing so, since Ungerboeck’s labeling is
used, C ′a is RI under an integer multiple of π/4 phase
shift, C ′b is RI under an integer multiple of π/2 phase
shift, and C ′c is RI under π phase shift. Because C
′
b
and C ′c are not RI for all integer multiples of π/4 phase
shift, θˆ should be adjusted at decoding stage a and b.
At decoding stage a, if the phase ambiguity is likely
an odd integer multiple of π/4 phase shift, one should
adjust the phase ambiguity to be an integer multiple of
π/2 phase shift, as (7). Similarly, at decoding stage b, if
the phase ambiguity is likely an odd integer multiple of
π/2 phase shift, one should adjust the phase ambiguity
to be 0 or π, as (9).
We can apply the near-optimal linear-complexity
noncoherent detector in [9] to the multistage decoding
in Section II to further improve the error performance of
NBC-MPSK. The detector for DPSK in [9] uses the esti-
mate of θ, θˆ, from the family Φ = {0, 2π
ML
, · · · , 2π(L−1)
ML
}.
The size L of Φ can be tuned to approach the optimal
performance as close as required. This near-optimal
linear-complexity noncoherent multistage decoder for
NBC-MPSK is illustrated as follows.
Step 1 For each θˆ ∈ Φ, perform the multistage de-
coding (6)-(10). This yields a decoded codeword
vˆ(θˆ) = cˆa + 2cˆb + 4cˆc.
Step 2 Among the candidates {vˆ(θˆ), θˆ ∈ Φ}, choose
the one which has the largest noncoherent metric
|(r, ζ vˆ)|.
C．Maximum-Likelihood Decoding Al-
gorithm for Noncoherent Block-Coded
MPSK
The ML decoding of noncoherent block codes is per-
formed according to (2), in which for each codeword
v of C, the value of |(r, ζv)| should be calculated. If
the number of codewords is too large, the ML decoding
would be too complicated to be realized. Motivated by
the A* decoding of binary linear block codes [10], [11],
we propose an ML decoding algorithm for NBC-MPSK
in this section. The description of the proposed algo-
rithm, modiﬁed from the description of A* algorithm
in [11], is given as follows.
Let C ′i of NBC-MPSK is associated with a (ki+1)×N
systematic generator matrix G′i whose ﬁrst column is
(100 · · ·0)T . Because the ﬁrst column of Gi is all-zero,
the ﬁrst code bit is always zero. The code of NBC-
MPSK is represented by a tree with 2k (k = ka+kb+kc)
depth N leaves representing codewords. Any node at
level l ≤ kc in the tree is fully deﬁned by the path
pl = v1v2 · · · vl of code symbol from the root to the
node.
The proposed algorithm searches the code tree for the
path that maximizes the path metric function s(r,v) =∣∣∣∑Ni=1 riζ−vi∣∣∣. On each iteration, it expands a node
that is likely to yield the optimal path and eliminates
any nodes that can only have suboptimal descendants.
Nodes are selected for expansion and eliminated from
consideration using an overestimate of the path met-
ric function, called a heuristic function in [10], [11]. A
heuristic function f(l) of a node at level l must up-
per bound the true path metric function for all paths
that pass through the node. Since the path metric over
all codewords that begin with the path pl is upper-
bounded by
s(r,v) ≤

we deﬁne a heuristic function f1 by f1(l) =∣∣∣∑li=1 riζ−vi∣∣∣ +∑Ni=l+1 |ri|. Let ZNM denote the set of
length N vectors whose components are the modulo-M
integer group and v′ denote (vl+1, vl+2, · · · , vN). Be-
cause max

∣∣∣∑Ni=l+1 riζ−vi∣∣∣ ≤ max
v′∈ZN−lM
∣∣∣∑Ni=l+1 riζ−vi∣∣∣ ≤∑N
i=l+1 |ri|, we deﬁne another heuristic function f2 by
f2(l) =
∣∣∣∑li=1 riζ−vi∣∣∣ + max
v′∈ZN−lM
∣∣∣∑Ni=l+1 riζ−vi∣∣∣, where
max
v′∈ZN−lM
∣∣∣∑Ni=l+1 riζ−vi∣∣∣ can be obtained by using the fast
ML detection of DPSK in [15].
Han et al. [10] noted that if the bit positions cor-
responding to the more reliable received symbols are
expanded ﬁrst, then the search will be directed more
quickly to close candidate codewords. The greater the
magnitude of the received symbol the more reliable that
symbol is. Our algorithm also sorts the received sym-
bols by their magnitude except the ﬁrst symbol, and
reorders the columns of the generator matrix to match
the symbol sorting and then tries to row reduce the
generator matrix so that it is systematic (except the

D．Noncoherent Space-Time Block-
Coded QPSK
Consider a communication system with MT transmit
antennas and MR receive antennas. The channels be-
tween antenna pairs are Rayleigh-fading and indepen-
dent of each other. The fading coeﬃcients are constant
for a block of T symbol periods. Let CN (0,1) denote
zero-mean, unit-variance, complex Gaussian distribu-
tion. The received signals are given by
R =
√
ρ
M
SH + W (13)
where R is the T ×MR matrix of received signals {rtn},
S is the T ×MT matrix of transmitted signals selected
from a unitary space-time constellation {stm}, H is the
MT ×MR matrix of channel transfer whose entries are
CN (0,1), W is the T × MR matrix of additive white
Gaussian noises with CN (0,1) entries, and ρ is the ex-
pected SNR at each receiver antenna.
Let I denote an identity matrix and † denote conju-
gate transpose. The constellation of L unitary space-
time signals is S1 =
√
TΦ1, · · · , SL =
√
TΦL, where the
T ×MT matrix Φ satisﬁes Φ†Φ = I for 1 ≤  ≤ L [12].
The noncoherent ML decoder is [12]
Sˆ = arg max
S=S1,··· ,SL

where
∥∥R†S∥∥2 = ∑MRn=1∑MTm=1 ∣∣∣∑Tt=1 rtns∗tm∣∣∣2. In [2],
constellations are chosen that maximize ξ2 = T

Let A0 = {S ′(0), S ′(1), · · · , S ′(15)} represent a signal
set containing space-time signals, in which each signal
S ′(k) at time i is labeled by (ai, bi, ci, di), where k =
ai + bi × 2 + ci × 4 + di × 8. The transmitted signals S
of noncoherent space-time block-coded MPSK C in [2]
is determined by
S =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
S ′(a1 + b1 × 2 + c1 × 4 + d1 × 8)

where ca = (a1, a2, · · · , an), cb = (b1, b2, · · · , bn), cc =
(c1, c2, · · · , cn), and cd = (d1, d2, · · · , dn) are codewords
of binary block codes Ca, Cb, Cc, and Cd respectively.
Herein, we propose a new A0 using QPSK
for MT = 2 deﬁned by S′(0) =
(

)
,
S′(8) =
( −1 1

, S′(7) =

, and S′(15) =( −j 1

)
. Note that signals in A0 are in the
form
(
s1 s2
−s∗2 s∗1
)
, which is the space-time block code
(STBC) in [19]. For C using this A0, by a procedure
similar to the proof in [2], it can be shown that
ξ2 = min{dncH,a(1− dncH,a
n
), 2dncH,b(1− dncH,b
n
),
2dncH,c(1− dncH,c
n
), 4dncH,d(1− dncH,d
n
)}. (17)
When n approaches inﬁnity, (17) becomes ξ2 =
min{dncH,a, 2dncH,b, 2dncH,c, 4dncH,d}.
The component codes Ci of noncoherent space-time
block-coded MPSK C [2] is modiﬁed from C ′i containing
1 for i ∈ {a, b, c, d}, as NBC-MPSK in [1]. To use the
tree-search ML decoding algorithm, for i ∈ {a, b, c, d},
we also let C ′i is associated with a (ki + 1) × N sys-
tematic generator matrix G′i whose ﬁrst column is
(100 · · ·0)T . By doing so, the ﬁrst space-time signal
is always S ′(0). To decode C, we can use the proposed
ML decoding algorithm for NBC-MPSK with a diﬀerent
