二、緣由與目的 
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, approximately 1% of people 
in the world have epilepsy. One third of the patients cannot be controlled with today’s 
available antiepileptic drugs. 8% may profit from epilepsy surgery and the remaining 25% of 
epilepsy patients cannot be treated sufficiently by any available therapy. If seizures cannot be 
controlled, the patient experiences major limitations in family, social, educational, and 
vocational activities. Recently, alternative techniques, such as vagus nerve stimulation or deep 
brain stimulation (Theodore and Fisher, 2004; Stacey and Litt, 2008), have been proposed. In 
addition to an open-loop seizure controller, a real-time, close-loop device is more convince 
for seizure control (Feddersen et al. 2007; Stacey and Litt, 2008). 
A number of methods have been proposed to detect epileptic seizures from EEG. 
Time-frequency analysis approaches such as short-time Fourier transform and wavelet 
transform (Hese et al., 2003; Schuyler et al., 2007; Bosnyakova et al.,2007) that analyzed the 
fundamental frequencies and the harmonic frequencies of seizure events were proposed for 
seizure detection. Complexity analysis of EEG such as entropy (Kannathal et al., 2005; Rosso 
et al., 2007; Srinivasn at al., 2007) has also proposed to analyze seizure discharges. 
Combination of wavelet and entropy or Lyapunov exponents were also proposed to analyze 
the complexity of specific EEG sub-bands for seizure detection (Ghosh-Dastidat et al., 2007) 
Due to self-training capability neural networks have also been utilized for classification of 
normal and seizure event according to the spectral or entropy of the EEG recordings 
(Srinivasn at al., 2007; Ghosh-Dastidat et al., 2007). Most of the existing seizure detection 
methods only distinguish the abnormal discharges and the waking EEG. In addition to normal 
waking EEG, the detection method must be robust enough to differentiate seizures from 
spindles (in sleeping) and motor artifacts that are similar to the patterns of seizures. 
In stead of a large-scale fixed machine, the physiological signal monitoring system will 
be extremely useful in many areas if they are portable and capable of wirelessly monitoring 
target physiological signals and analyzing them in real time. However, most of the existing 
physiological signal monitoring systems can only record the signals without the capability of 
automatic analysis. Recently, with the development of embedded system and signal 
 4 
communication. The ZigBee module transceiver was connected to the computer through its 
USB port by a USB to UART module.  
 
A. The Seizure Detection Method 
Fig. 1 shows an example of EEG patterns corresponding to various behavioral states 
including wakefulness (WK), spike-wave discharge (SWD), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and 
movement artifact in a continuous recording of a Long-Evans rat. In order to develop a 
seizure monitoring and controlling system in freely moving subjects, the seizure detection 
must be robust enough to avoid false alarms caused by various daily activities.

Fig. 2 shows the functional block diagrams of the proposed seizure detection method. 
Approximate entropy (ApEn), a measure that quantifies the regularity or predictability of a 
time series, is utilized to analysis the complexity of EEG signals. Since ApEn values of the 
ictal EEGs sometimes overlap with those of the interictal EEGs, so EEG spectrum analysis is 
also included for feature extraction in this paper.

bands of spontaneous brain waves because of its well-established implementation in various 
microprocessors. To determine spectral indexes for adequately extracting an SWD feature,

Results 
Performance of the on-line closed-loop seizure controller applied on six adult male 
Long-Evans rats was assessed. Subjects 1, 2 and 3 were subjected to absence seizures and 
Subject 4, 5, and 6 were subjected to PTZ-induced seizures.  
In Fig. 4(a) and 4(b), the EEG signals of subject #2 without and with applying the 
proposed system are shown, respectively. In Fig. 4(a), the length of the SWD event is about 
3.5 seconds. When the seizure controller was applied, the seizure was detected in 0.44 
seconds after its onset, shown as the duration between two vertical lines in Fig. 4(b). Upon the 
detection of the seizure, SWD was suppressed by the ZI stimulation (the bottom of Fig. 4(b)). 
Fig. 4(c) shows a similar result for a PTZ-induced seizure on subject #3. Fig. 4(d) shows no 
obvious disturbance of EEG during sleep when a false electrical stimulation took place. No 
abnormal brain activity or sleep interference was found in wake-sleep states according to the 
video recordings in all rats. Fig. 5 shows that nine seizures are detected and then suppressed 
during a 40-second period on subject #2. The seizure detection latency was found consistently 
less than 0.6 s.

 Fig. 6 depicts a representative example of seizure suppression by continuous ZI 
stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6A, 90% or more of SWDs could be suppressed by a single ZI 
stimulation. In contrast, only 60-70% of PTZ-induced epilepsy could be suppressed by a 
single ZI stimulation (Fig. 6B). On average, >90% of ZI stimulation with a single or two 
pulse trains successfully controlled epilepsy.

microwires, including tissue impedance, was measured using the Agilent 4294A Impedance 
Analyzer. As shown in Fig. 7A, the left side of the vertical dashed line was a 2-hr execution of 
the system on the rat. After this 2-hr execution of the system, the brain tissue impedance was 
measured continuously last for 168 hours, that is a week (Fig. 7B). We observed that the brain 
tissue impedance restored the original impedance.

Purpose: Lamotrigine (LTG) is an antiepileptic on both convulsive and 
nonconvulsive seizures. However, LTG effects on various epileptic animal models are 
controversial because of different administering routs or durations. In this study, effect 
of chronic LTG treatment on a rat model of absence epilepsy was assessed. 
Methods: To clarify LTG effect on absence seizures and its comorbidity of anxiety 
and depression, LTG (10 mg/kg) or water was perorally administered twice daily on 
Long-Evans rats with spontaneous spike-wave discharges (SWDs) for 35 days. 
Anxious behavior was assessed by open field and elevated plus maze tests, and 
depressive behaviors by sucrose consumption and forced swimming tests. 
Key Findings: Acute LTG administration had no effect on seizure frequency. Total 
SWD duration, SWD number, and mean SWD duration were significantly decreased 
in rats with 35-day LTG treatment compared to those of rats receiving vehicle. Rats of 
LTG group displayed significantly longer duration entering the central zone of an 
open field and higher frequency exploring open arms of an elevated plus maze. 
During forced swimming test, immobile duration of rats receiving LTG was 
significantly shorter than that of control group. Moreover, the LTG group showed 
tendentiously higher sucrose intake than that of vehicle group in sucrose consumption 
test. 
Significance: Our results suggest that chronic LTG treatment has a benefit on 
suppression of absence seizures and amelioration of seizure-related 
anxious/depressive comorbidity.
