隨著無線通訊技術與寬頻網際網路的發
展日趨成熟，隨時隨地無線上網的願景即
將實現。在過去幾年當中，傳輸分集技術
有相當深入地研究以改善無線系統的錯
誤性能，許多新的時空碼不斷地被發明出
來。時空區段碼可使用簡單的解碼架構達
到完全分集，但無法提供額外的編碼增
益。時空籬柵碼能夠獲得最佳分集增益與
一些編碼增益，但其編碼增益仍然不夠
好。將一個外部碼與時空區段碼作聯結可
以獲得更高的編碼增益，然而外部碼的保
護位元會造成聯結碼的傳輸率下降。為了
改善這項缺點，若以時空區段碼的擴展集
合(超越正交時空區段碼)作為聯結碼的內
碼，將不會有傳輸率下降的問題。在本計
畫中，我們首先建構正交時空區段碼的集
合分割，配合多階層區段碼設計出多階層
時空碼。之後我們將建構超越正交時空區
段碼的集合分割，並在不同區段間加入編
碼而提出一項時空碼的新設計。

時空碼。
Abstract
Over the past several years, transmit
diversity has been studied extensively to
provide improved error performance for
wireless systems. Many space-time coding
scheme, including space-time block codes
and space-time trellis codes, have been
proposed. Space-time block codes provide
full diversity and a very simple decoding
scheme. However, they do not provide the
additional coding gain. Space-time trellis
codes can provide full diversity gain as well
as additional coding gain at the price of
higher decoding complexity. By
concatenating an outer trellis encoder and an
inner space-time block code, the
concatenated scheme can achieve full
diversity gain and improved coding gain.
However, the outer code has redundancy
and the overall transmission rate of the
concatenated scheme is reduced. Hence, the
set of inner space-time block code needs to
be expanded to achieve a higher coding rate.
The super-orthogonal space-time trellis code
is constructed based on the concept of set
partitioning on an expanded set of the
space-time block code. In this project, a
systematic method of combining multilevel
block codes and set partitioning of a
space-time block code is discussed. Then,
we consider the set partitioning of the
super-orthogonal code, and show how to
provide interblock coding between different
levels of adjacent blocks in the multilevel
space-time block code.
Keywords: Interblock memory, set
partitioning, super-orthogonal space-time
codes.

According to the rank and determinant
criteria described in [1], the design target of
the multilevel space-time code is to achieve
full diversity and maximize CGD over all
pairs of distinct coded blocks.
Generally, the expanded OSTBC is not a
full diversity code if .ii   As the result,
we propose an improved multilevel coding
scheme by providing interlevel coding [15]
between adjacent coded blocks. There are
two major advantages in our new design.
First, full diversity can still be warranted.
Second, the coding rate of the improved
scheme can be increased as compared to the
original multilevel coding scheme. An
example code of two transmission antennas
and one receive antenna using the QPSK
constellation is presented to illustrate the
design.

The proposed scheme can be decoded
by using the Viterbi algorithm on the
decoding trellis of .ˆC The squared
Euclidean distance is used as the decoding
metric. The four-state trellis of Cˆ is shown
in Fig. 3, which is a composition of six
partial trellises for .ˆ,,ˆ,ˆ )1()5()6( CCC  The
trellis structure is very simple. Simulation
results using two transmit antennas and one
receive antenna on the quasi-static Rayleigh
fading channel are given in Fig. 4. Each
frame consists of 130 symbols out of each
transmit antenna. The frame error rates of
some space-time coding schemes (the TSC
code [1], the SOSTTC codes [8], [9], the
STBC-MDSP code [10], and the extended
SOSTTC code [11]) are also included. It can
be seen that the proposed example has the
best error performance. For a frame error
rate of ,10 3 our four-state code
outperforms the 256-state SOSTTC code by
2 dB.
4. Conclusion
A novel multilevel space-time coding
scheme with full rate and full diversity has
been proposed. The error performance of the
proposed scheme is good due to the large
coding gain distance. This conclusion is
further enhanced by the simulation results.
