as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 
and nitrited PAH (regarded as carcinogens), 
reduction of deforestation, increased lubricity for 
long-life utilization, and a higher flash point for 
safer storage and management. Its somewhat lower 
heating value, on the other hand, could be 
compensated for by mixing it with petroleum diesel. 
In doing so, performance would not be greatly 
affected and combustion may still be carried out 
within the existing burners. In spite of these 
observed features, few reports have been given in 
the literature in terms of a systematic investigation 
for the burning characteristics of diesel/biodiesel 
mixtures, as those frequently performed for droplet 
combustion with spherical flame geometry in the 
absence of natural convection. Also, most studies 
were performed directly in the practical burning 
devises such as internal combustion engines, which 
could involve complex factors whose roles and 
effects cannot be clearly identified. 
In this study, we have systematically 
investigated the burning of biodiesel fuel based on 
the fundamental structure of a spherical droplet in a 
microgravity condition, which hence reduced the 
influence of external convection particularly from 
buoyancy. Furthermore, the fuel was mixed with 
diesel and/or alcohol (methanol, ethanol and 
propanol), which was another source of biological 
energy, for investigation of the possibility for 
making a better blend according to the desired 
properties. In particular, as compared to pure diesel 
and alkanes, biodiesel was found to yield much less 
tendency to a soot layer that could be formed in a 
spherical symmetry of droplet flame under the 
reduced-gravity condition [1]. Its mixture with the 
other fuels also exhibited reduction of such soot 
accumulation. The harmful products could further 
be mitigated by addition of alcohol, which however 
needed biodiesel to serve as a connector if it was to 
be blended with diesel. Thereby the fundamental 
work revealed plausibility of using such a blend of 
biodiesel and/or alcohol for mitigation of pollutant 
production specifically of soot.

2. Experimental Setup 
The experimental configuration of the drop 
tower is shown in Fig. 1, about 3.5 m in height. A 
combustion chamber is built in a drop package, as 
shown in Fig. 2, which is enclosed by a drag shield 
used to further reduce the g-level (estimated to be 
10-2  10-4) and hence the Grashof number (about 
10-4). A fuel droplet, with size being adjusted 
through controlled injection of multiple droplets by 
a piezoelectric generator [1], was stabilized 
initially on the crossing point of two ceramic fibers, 
whose diameter was 2.5 µm. The whole package 
was hung by an electromagnet before it was 
released after triggering of an electronic signal. The 
droplet was heated during the drop by a pair of hot 
wires (0.2 mm) made of Kanthal, a metal alloy that 
can withstand high temperature and has superior 
electric resistance.

Due to higher evaporation rate, methanol has 
larger tendency of increasing the burning rate, as 
compared to ethanol and propanol. As shown in Fig. 
5(a) and 5(b), respectively, the average burning rate 
is increased with higher fraction of methanol and 
the heating delay is decreased.

3.3 Soot formation 
The quantity of soot is usually not measured 
with ease. In the microgravity condition, however, 
due to creation of a soot shell, one may compare 
qualitatively the formation of soot particles for 
various fuels. As shown in Fig. 6(a), a soot shell is 
formed during the burning of a droplet. By adding 
methanol (Fig. 6b), which is an essentially 
non-sooting fuel, the formation becomes weaker. 
With addition of ethanol or propanol, as shown in 
Figs. 6(c) and 6(d), almost no clear soot shell is 
established.

propanol 
 
This method can be applied to mixtures of 
diesel, which has large tendency toward soot 
formation. As shown in Fig. 7(a), a solid and 
condensed structure of soot particles is formed 
throughout the burning. With addition of 35% 
ethanol and 15% biodiesel as a connecting 
interface, the solid layer becomes looser and could 
be softened during combustion.
