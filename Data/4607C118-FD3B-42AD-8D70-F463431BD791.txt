1. Introduction 
The pioneering investigator, 
Nusselt, conducted the research on film 
condensation in 1916. Thereafter, some 
studies had been made on the laminar 
film condensation of a quiescent vapor. 
For example, Sparrow [1] did a research 
on the problem of vapor condensation 
on a horizontal cylinder. And Hasson 
and Jakob [2] investigated the free 
convection in laminar film condensation 
on inclined tubes. Furthermore, 
Shekriladze et al. [3] explored the 
problem of laminar film condensation of 
flowing vapor and analyzed film 
condensation on horizontal tubes under 
low velocity vapor flow conditions. 
Subsequently, some literature relating to 
research into forced convection of 
laminar film condensation on horizontal 
tubes were published, e.g. Fujii et al. [4] 
who studied the two-phase boundary 
layer equations of laminar film 
condensation on a horizontal cylinder. In 
a later study, Rose [5] considered the 
effect of the pressure gradient on forced 
convection laminar film condensation on 
a horizontal tube. Meanwhile, Mosaad 
[6] researched into combined free and 
forced convection laminar film 
condensation on an inclined circular 
tube with an isothermal surface. 
 Hsu and Yang [7] studied the process of 
combined forced and natural convection 
laminar film condensation on a 
horizontal tube with variable wall 
temperature. And Yang et al. [8] 
investigated the analytical solution for 
transient laminar film condensation on a 
horizontal elliptical tube. Besides, 
Sarma et al. [9] presented a study 
performed theoretical research into 
turbulent film condensation on a 
horizontal tube. However, there is little 
investigation on the issues relating to 
turbulent film condensation on inclined 
tubes under variable wall temperature. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to 
investigate turbulent film condensation 
on an inclined tube considering  wall 
temperature amplitude and to calculate 
local condensate film thickness and the 
heat  
transfer characteristics.   
                                  
2. Analysis 
Consider an inclined tube 
immersed in a downward flowing pure 
vapor. The saturation temperature of the 
vapor is Ts, and the vapor is moving at a 
uniform velocity, u∞. The variable wall 
temperature is represented by )(θwT . 
Condensation occurs on the wall of the 
tube, and a continuous film of the liquid 
runs downward over the tube. The 
physical model and the coordinate 
system adopted in this study are shown 
in Figure 1. The governing equations for 
the turbulent condensate film are 
described by the following equations:

3. Results and discussion 
Figure 2 presents the variation of 
condensate dimensionless film thickness 
when the angle of inclination is π/6. 
Seeing from the figure, the 
dimensionless thickness will increase 
when both the value of θ  and 
dimensionless longitudinal coordinate 
z+ increase. The dimensionless 
thickness reaches its maximum value at 
the downstream of the tube ( πθ = , 
++ = LZ ). 
Figure 3 shows the variation of the 
local Nusselt number around the overall 
circumference of the tube. Regarding the 
variation of the heat transfer around the 
peripheral of the tube, i.e. the variation 
of x- direction, it can be seen that the 
value of the shear Reynolds (R*) number 
gradually increases with increasing 
angular position from its minimum value 
at the upper stagnation point to its 
maximum value at 
2
πθ = . 
Subsequently, the value of the shear 
Reynolds number decreases gradually as 
the angular position increases, and R* 
reaches its minimum value at the lower 
stagnation point. According to the 
former phenomenon, the local Nusselt 
number presents the same distribution
