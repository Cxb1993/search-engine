1. Introduction 
 
In the IC industry, the packaging processes play a key role to determining the quality of the IC 
components and products. The quality problem in the IC packaging processes is changeable and typical of 
multiple responses in nature. The data collected from experiments are always probabilistic in nature. It is 
desirable to investigate the multi-response quality problem for the IC packaging processes using 
probabilistic-based optimization techniques. Then, a satisfactory combination of control parameters may be 
obtained to meet the demand for quality and competitive advantages. 
In manufacturing sectors, when new products are being developed or product quality is being controlled, 
Taguchi method as well as response surface method is considered as a reliable technique to find a satisfactory 
combination of design parameters for the single response quality problem. As for the multi-response quality 
problem, different approach might be needed. In the early years, several approaches such as assignment of 
weights to each quality response, application of principal components, or utilization of regression analysis 
have been considered for dealing with multi-response problems. Limited results are gained from those 
approaches. One different approach to adopting desirability function or loss function for combining multiple 
responses into single response was applied. The approach to applying the desirability function did not 
consider the covariance effect among quality responses and the adoption of loss function demands too 
complicated data computations. 
Recently, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been applied to cope with multi-response quality 
problems with certain expected results. Still, some conventional DEA methods cannot provide complete 
ranking results for possible combinations of parameters. Not to mention the capability for dealing with the 
issues of covariance effect among quality responses and probabilistic nature in experimental data. Thereby, it 
is imperative to develop a desirable DEA model that can simultaneously consider probabilistic and covariance 
effect problems while providing complete ranking results. 
In this study, the multi-response quality problem for IC packaging processes will be investigated and 
analyzed for the selection of control parameters and response factors. Taguchi method will be used to design 
robust experiments using the selected control factors. Experimental data for response factors will be collected. 
A stochastic super-efficiency DEA model will be proposed for dealing with probabilistic output data while 
providing complete ranking results. Sensitivity analysis will be performed to show the sensitivity of ranking 
results to changes in probability distribution. Finally, a satisfactory combination of control parameters and 
levels will be obtained using the signal-to-noise ratio additive model. 
 
2. Literature Review 
   Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was proposed by Charnes et al. (1978) by formulating an input-based, 
constant return to scale DEA model. The DEA model they built has been coined as the CCR model. Their 
efforts initiated a study of performance measure method and modeling. Later, Banker et al. (1984) extended 
 4 
robust parameter design to determine those quality-influencing parameters (controllable factors) and noise 
factors (uncontrollable factors and environment-inducing factors) for finding optimum combination of factors 
and the associated levels. The aim is to reach the expected target value while reducing variance and meet the 
customer demand while reducing the cost (Phadke, 1989). Taguchi’s method is mainly applied to resolve the 
single response quality problem. Although there are many research papers that address single-response quality 
problem, practical problems often involve several characteristics of multi-response quality problems. For the 
multi-response quality problem, more advanced techniques should be considered. 
    An early survey by Khuri (1996) showed that most of the existing multi-response approaches combine 
multiple responses into a single response by appropriate transformation. Recently, many scholars devoted to 
develop different methods for dealing with multi-response quality problems. Those methods can be 
summarized as weight assignment method, regression and mathematical programming method, principal 
component method, fuzzy logic method, grey relationship analytical method, data envelopment analysis 
method, and neural networks method. 
   Shiau (1990), Tai et al. (1992) and Antony (2001) presented a method to convert the multi-response 
problem to single response problem by assigning weight to each response. It is difficult in the real-world to 
find acceptable weights for each response variable. Dabbas et al. (2003) proposed multiple response 
optimization using mixture-designed experiments and desirability functions in semiconductor scheduling.  
Su and Tong (1997) and Fung and Kang (2005) applied principal components technique to solve Taguchi 
method for multiple responses optimization problems. The principal components technique converts all the 
interrelated response factors into a few independent components and provides a satisfactory combination of 
factors and levels for parameter design. The main weakness of principal components might lie in the fact that 
it tries to interpret the whole variation using small variance. Its effort is not enough to fully explain the 
variation in the multi-response problem. 
Hsieh et al. (2005) adopted statistical regression and fitness function for optimizing multi-response 
problems. Reddy et al. (1997) unified robust design and goal programming for multi-response optimization 
problems. Yang and Tseng (2002) and Goel et al. (2007) combined response surface optimization and goal 
programming approach to solve for multi-response problems in integrated-circuit ink marking problems. In 
fact, no goal-programming problem was actually solved in their method. Koksoy (2008) presented a nonlinear 
programming model using mean square deviation function and devised a generalized decent gradient 
algorithm for solving parameter combination problems. Tong and Su (1997) solved a multi-response design 
problem using a multiple-attribute decision-making method. They considered the quality loss of each response 
and adopted a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to optimize the 
multi-response design problem. Later, Yang and Chou (2005) applied TOPSIS method to find an optimal 
parameter combination by assigning and normalizing a surrogate objective function for each response. Tarng 
et al. (2000), Lin et al. (2000), and Chien et al. (2008) applied fuzzy logic methods for solving multi-response 
problems. Lin and Lin (2002) and Chiang and Hsieh (2009) used orthogonal array with grey relational

values are equal to 0, then the evaluating oDMU  is said to be efficient. Basically, the BCC model can be 
used to evaluate efficiency or inefficiency for each DMU. 
Based on the BCC model, Anderson and Peterson (1993) developed a so-called super-efficiency model.  
This output-oriented super-efficiency DEA model is defined as follows.

Efficient DMUs have an index equal to or less than 1. It represents the maximum possible 
proportional decrease in an output vector retaining DMU efficiency. Inefficient DMUs are 
assigned an index of efficiency greater than 1, which could be interpreted as the minimum 
increase in output vector that is required to make a DMU efficient. It is worth emphasizing that 
we can solve the proposed super-efficiency model to find efficient DMUs as well as rank them. 
This derives from the fact that efficient DMUs have efficiency score less than or equal to 1.  
The conventional DEA models don’t allow stochastic variations in input and output. To remove this 
weakness in the conventional DEA models, some scholars incorporated stochastic input and output 
variations into the DEA models (Huang and Li, 1996; Cooper et al., 2004; Khodabakhshi and Asgharian, 
2009; and Khodabakhshi, 2009).  
In this study, stochastic version of the output-oriented super-efficiency model will be proposed, 
which allows for the consideration of stochastic variations in output data. Following Cooper et al. (2004), 
let )~,...,~(~ sjijj yyy  be random output related to ),...,1(, njDMU j  . Suppose that all output components 
are jointly normally distributed. The stochastic version of the super-efficiency DEA model may be 
expressed as follows.

Therefore, the model (6) is equivalent to model (4).  
Theorem 1. If 5.0 , then results of the model (6) and model (2) are the same. 
Proof: Since 1 (0.5) = 0, it is obvious. 
Theorem 2. For 5.00  ,

  (2) Suppose that for DMUo, 1

sup* o  in model (2). 
Proof:  
(1) Note that since 5.00  , Φ-1(α) < 0. Therefore, y’ro > yro. Thus, if , then there exists a 
solution with  for the super-efficiency model (2), when evaluating DMUo, which is 
in contrast with . Therefore, this contradiction shows that we must have 1
sup* o .

This follows directly from (1).

Proof:

These theorems for sensitivity analysis suggest that the ranking results will be the same for both stochastic 
and deterministic super-efficiency models when the significant level equal to 0.5, that is, 5.0 . Otherwise, 
the ranking results might be different.
