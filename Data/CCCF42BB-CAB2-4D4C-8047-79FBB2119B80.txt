the inability of the leading end to match the 
input end movement precisely as described 
above presents a challenging task for control 
engineers to design such a medical robot. To 
overcome this obstacle, a thorough 
understanding of the mechanics involved in 
the stent procedure is desirable. This project 
is a response to this need. 
       
Wire deformation  
Figure 2 shows the plane section 
passing through the circular center line of the 
rigid tube, which models the artery. On this 
plane section the outer and inner radii of the 
tubular housing measured from the center of 
the curvature are or  and ir , respectively. ψ  
is the span angle of the tube.  
  
Deformation pattern 1: point contact on 
inner radius at the middle point 
In the case when ψ  is not very large, 
for instance, 2/πψ =  as shown in Fig. 2, 
the wire may contact the tube at three points, 
A, B, and C, when it is placed inside the 
tube. During the stent procedure the surgeon 
pushes in the wire from the input end. At the 
output end B the wire can be blocked by 
obstacles in the blood vessel. As a 
consequence, the wire can be considered as 
being under external compressive force F 
tangential to the wire at end points A and B. 
It is noted that the direction of the tangential 
force F changes with the deformation of the 
wire. Therefore, F is a non-conservative 
force. When F increases to a certain value, 
the wire and the inner radius may lose 
contact and eventually the wire will contact 
the outer radius instead. In the following we 
explain how to determine the shape of the 
deformed wire.  
First of all we establish an xy-
coordinate system with the origin at point A. 
The moment equation at any point (x,y) of 
the deformed wire can be written as 
( ) ( )xFNyFN

dEI ααααθ sincoscossin +−+−−=
      (1) 
N is the force provided by the corner of the 
tube in the direction normal to the wire at 
point A. It is noted that the resultant force on 
the wire at point A is not constrained to be 
tangential to the wall or tangential to the 
wire. α  and θ  are the slopes of the wire at 
point A and at the point (x,y), respectively. 
EI is the flexural rigidity of the wire. s is the 
length of the wire measured from point A. 
For convenience we introduce the following 
dimensionless parameters (with asterisks):  
( ) ( )

Similarly, we may introduce the 
dimensionless distributed force (per unit

will be used later, as

Eq. (1), and dropping all the superposed 
asterisks thereafter for simplicity, we obtain 
the dimensionless equilibrium equation

force +CR  at point C splits into two point 
forces +HR  at H and continues to increase as 
F increases, as shown in Fig. 6(b). In this 
deformation pattern the contact angle +Hψ  
increases from zero when F increases from 
6.3, as shown in Fig. 6(d). The contact angle 
+
Hψ  is equal to about 16/π  when F=10. In 
the meantime the distributed contact force q 
increases as F increases, as shown in Fig. 
6(e). It is noted that +Hψ  will not be equal to ψ  no matter how large the magnitude of F 
is. This is because the bending moments at 
the end points are zero, and as a consequence 
the curvature of the deformed wire will never 
match the curvature of the outer radius near 
the end points. In the deformation patterns 3 
and 4 the middle point of the wire remains 
on the outer radius so that 1.0=ε  as shown 
in Fig. 6(a).  
The total length of the wire inside the 
tube depends on the compressive force F and 
the deformation pattern. For instance, when 
the wire is first inserted into the tube, the 
total length inside the tube can be calculated 
from Eq. (13) with F=0. We denote this 
length as 0l . When F increases, the total 
length l inside the tube increases, as can also 
be calculated from Eq. (13). Therefore, if 
one end of the tube is blocked, we can push 
in the wire a distance 0lll −=Δ  from the 
other end with increasing F. This lΔ  is 
responsible for the lagging phenomenon we 
mentioned in the beginning of this paper. 
Figure 6(f) shows lΔ  as a function of the 
compressive force F. It is noted that if the 
wire is undergoing deformation pattern 2 and 
the output end is blocked, then increasing the 
compressive force magnitude at the input 
end will result in the wire protruding out of 
the input end instead of pushing in. 
To conveniently observe the wire 
deformation in the laboratory we build a 
circular channel with two walls on a table, as 
shown in Fig. 7. The span angle ψ  is 2/π . 
The outer and inner radii are 15 and 13.5 cm, 
respectively. Therefore the radius ratio 
.9.0=η  The metallic wire is taken from a 
stent kit. The diameter of the wire is 
negligible compared to the clearance of the 
channel. The left end of the channel is 
blocked. The wire is pushed in by hand from 
the right-hand end. Figure 7(a) shows the 
deformation (the black line) pattern 1 when 
the wire is initially put in the channel. The 
wire is in point contact with the inner radius 
at the middle point. Figures 7(b), (c) and (d) 
show the deformation patterns 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively, when the wire is pushed in by 
hand.  
   
Conclusions 
In this paper we study the deformation 
of a guidewire inside a blood vessel during 
stent deployment procedure. Some 
conclusions can be summarized as follows: 
 
(1) Due to the constraint on the inner and 
outer radii, the deformation pattern of 
the wire changes as the magnitude of the 
external compression at the end changes.  
(2) The total length of the wire inside the 
tube varies as the wire undergoes 
bending deformation through the 
exertion of end compression. This 
mechanism is responsible for the lagging 
phenomenon observed in the laboratory.  
(3) There exists a range of compressive 
force magnitude for which one force 
magnitude corresponds to three different 
deformation patterns. Each of these three 
deformation patterns corresponds to a 
different slope of the compressive force. 
All of them are realizable in the 
laboratory. As a consequence, a 
deformation pattern jump may occur 
simply by adjusting the direction of the 
input force while holding the magnitude 
of the force constant.
