1.  Introduction 
Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is considered to have superior potential for 
commercialization thanks to its high energy conversion efficiency, self-reforming 
ability, compatibility with common hydrocarbon fuels, use of solid state materials, 
and no need of noble metals as catalysts [1]. SOFC can be used in large-size 
stationary power facilities or applied to heat and power generation for homes and 
businesses as well as auxiliary power units for electrical systems in transportation 
vehicles. Planar-type SOFCs are superior to those with tubular designs because of 
their simple manufacturing process and the promise of a high power density [2].  
Conventional electrolyte-supported SOFC structure limits the minimum 
electrolyte thickness to ≈ 150μm, thereby requiring an operating temperature of 
about 900 to 1000°C to minimize the high-ohmic loss due to the thick electrolyte 
[3]. Such a high operating temperature implies poor long-term stability and places a 
stringent constraint on material selection; cost of materials, especially that of 
interconnect materials, can thus be fairly steep. In recent years, enormous research 
efforts have been invested on the development of intermediate temperature SOFCs 
(IT-SOFCs) capable of operating at temperatures between 500 and 700°C [4]. 
However, the performance of IT-SOFCs depends strongly on the ionic conductivity 
of the electrolyte and the polarization resistance (Rp) of the electrodes [5]. The 
former problem can be solved by using alternative electrolytes with higher ionic 
conductivity at low temperatures, such as La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3-δ (LSGM) and 
Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (SDC) or by using a thin yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte 
film [6].  
Several film-deposition approaches have been used to reduce the thicknesses of 
electrolyte layers. These approaches can be categorized into three classes: (a). 
Physical methods including sputtering [7], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [8]; (b).

2. Experimental Procedure 
Commercially available raw materials for SOFC, including Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (SDC; 
Fuel Cell Materials, USA; d50 = 0.53 μm and BET surface area = 6.2 m2g-1), 
La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF: Fuel Cell Materials, USA; d50 = 0.99 μm and BET 
surface area = 5.4 m2g-1), and NiO (anode functional layer: Fuel Cell Materials,  
USA, d50 = 0.8 μm and BET surface area = 3.4 m2g-1; current collector layer: 
SHOWA, Japan, d50 = 10.1 μm and BET surface area = 0.06 m2g-1), were used in this 
study. The anode substrates built were composed of a current collector layer (outer 
layer) of pure NiO and two functional layers of NiO-SDC composites with ratios of 
60 wt%/40 wt% and 50 wt%/50 wt% respectively. Ceramic raw powders were mixed 
with 19.7 wt% of organic binder (B74001; Ferro), 25.6 wt% of solvent (60 wt% 
toluene/40 wt% ethanol) and 0.7 wt% of dispersant (M1201; Ferro) to form colloidal 
ceramic suspensions. The anode substrates were then built via tape casting process, 
and the dried and laminated tapes drilled into discs. 25 mm in diameter, the discs were 
co-fired at 1400oC for 2 hours at a heating rate of 2°Cmin-1. 
A Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ thick film was deposited on the anode substrates by AD method 
using Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ powder. The AD apparatus is schematically shown in Figure 1. 
Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ powders were heat treated at 1300°C for 4 hours, ball milled in methyl 
alcohol solution using polyethylene jars with zirconia balls for 6 hours, and 
subsequently oven dried at 80°C for 30 hours. The scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM; Hitachi S4700) image shown in Figure 2 reveals a granular morphology of the 
powder particles. The powders report an average particle size of 1.08 μm, as 
measured by light scattering analysis (Zeta 1000). The Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ fine powders 
were placed in a flask, into which carrier gas of O2 was introduced at the bottom of 
the powder bed to form an aerosol that was subsequently transferred to the deposition 
  - 8 -
(EIS) were measured after holding the cells under OCV for 15 minutes at each 
temperature. The EIS measurements were performed with a four-lead two-electrode 
configuration using a multi-channel Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Solartron 1470E) and a 
1260 frequency response analyzer with a computer interface and Corr-view software. 
The frequency range was from 105 Hz to 0.015 Hz, and the signal amplitude read 10 
mV. I–V curves and power curves were obtained using linear sweep from OCV to 0.2 
V at a sweep rate of 5 mVs-1. After testing, the microstructure of the cells was 
examined by SEM (Hitachi S4700). 
 
3.  Results and Discussion 
Figure 4 shows the SEM and Backscattering Electron Image (BEI) micrographs 
of the anode supported single cell structure of the SOFC with Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-δ (SDC) 
electrolyte layer deposited by AD method after electrochemical measurements. The 
interfaces among the anode, electrolyte, and cathode layers showed no sign of crack, 
discontinuity, or delamination. The anode electrode consists of three layers with a 
total thickness of approximately 0.66 mm, including a current collector layer of NiO 
(≈20 μm) and two functional composite layers (with the NiO/SDC ratios of 60/40 
wt% and 50/50wt%, and the thicknesses of ≈636 μm and ≈6 μm, respectively, as 
indicated in Table 2). XRD analysis confirmed the complete reduction of NiO to Ni at 
the anode after the electrochemical test. Both the anode and cathode layers were 
marked with the presence of porous microstructures. As shown in Figure 5(b), the 
observation of surface microstructure reveals that the SDC film has fine grain 
microstructures. The grain size of the SDC film is approximately 67 nm with a round 
morphology. The cross-sectional micrographs exhibit dense and granular 
microstructures [Figure 5(a)]. The film shows a fairly uniform thickness of 
approximately 1.5 μm. It can be observed that the SDC electrolyte deposited by 
  - 10 -
cell (R0), including the resistive contributions of the electrolyte, the two electrodes, 
the current collectors, and the lead wires. The lowest frequency intercept gives the 
overall resistance of the cell, and the distance between the two intercepts corresponds 
to the total interfacial polarization resistance (RP) [31]. Figure 8 presents the 
temperature dependence of R0 and RP of the single cells, and Table 3 lists the results. 
It can be observed that the R0 of the single cells increased continuously from 0.060 to 
0.62 Ω-cm2 as the measurement temperature went down from 700°C to 550°C. This is 
a typical occurrence due to the dependence of the ionic conductivity of the SDC on 
temperature. The SDC content at both the electrolyte layer and the Ni-SDC anode 
layer may serve as the major cause of the rising R0. It is evident from Figure 8 that RP 
rose as the temperature dropped, particularly at temperatures ≤ 600°C. It should be 
noted that the contribution of R0 to the total resistance (Rtot = R0 + RP) is small due to 
the thinner electrode layer (1.5 μm). The ratio of R0 to Rtot read approximately 35% at 
700°C and decreased dramatically as the operating temperature was reduced (<22% at 
550°C), suggesting that the SDC electrolyte film prepared by AD method appears to 
possess good quality and thus the performance of the cells depends critically on the 
polarization resistance of the electrode. 
The cell performance as a function of operating temperature and the temperature 
dependences of OCV and maximum power density for the anode supported SOFC 
with a SDC electrolyte deposited by AD method are shown in Figures 9 and 10, 
respectively. The SDC electrolyte layer possessed a higher electronic conduction that 
led to a lower OCV at high temperature, and the cells reported a higher degree of 
concentration polarization at high temperature as indicated by the convex-up 
curvature of the I-V curves at high current densities as shown in Figure 9 The open 
circuit voltage (OCV) of the single cell decreased with the rise in temperature, 
dropping from 0.81 V at 500°C to 0.59 V at 700°C. These OCV values are lower than 
  - 12 -
cathode layers for all cells showed good adhesion. 
b. The grain size of the film (67 nm) was much smaller than the particle size of the 
starting SDC powder (1.08 μm). No additional post annealing was required for 
solidification and densification after deposition. The XRD patterns of the 
as-deposited film confirmed the well-crystalline fine grains and random 
orientation microstructure. No additional phases were detected in the films. 
c. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the single cell dropped from 0.81 V to 0.59 V 
and the maximum power densities (MPD) escalated from 0.1 to 0.34 Wcm-2 as the 
operating temperature increased from 550°C to 700°C.
