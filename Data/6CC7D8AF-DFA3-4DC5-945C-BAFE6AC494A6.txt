3.Purpose
In the present study, an ultra-fine
samaria-doped ceria (Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9, SDC)
electrolyte prepared by the EDTA-citric
complexing method was developed for
intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells
(IT-SOFCs). The influence of pH value on the
synthesis of SDC powder based on the
combined EDTA–citrate complexing process
has been investigated. The influence of
calcination temperature and pH value on grain
resistance and grain boundary resistance due to
grain size after sintering was also investigated
in this study.
4.Experiment
4.1 Preparation of SDC Electrolyte
All the chemical reagents used in this
experiment were of analytical grade. Typically,
metal nitrates and oxides were used as the
metal sources. Stoichiometric amounts of 0.08
M (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 and 0.02 M Sm2O3 were
mixed into a solution. The necessary amount of
EDTA dissolved in an NH3 solution was then
dropped into the mixed metal nitrate solution,
followed by the addition by stirring of solid
citric acid (mole ratio of total metal ions to
EDTA and to citrate=1:1:2). Then, NH4OH was
used to adjust the pH of the solution to the
desired value. The solution was heated, and
above 80 it turned into a transparent gel; it℃
was then heated in a 180 oven to convert it to℃
a solid precursor. Next, the precursor was
calcined at a high temperature in air for the
preparation of a dense ceramic electrolyte. The
synthesized powders were uniaxially pressed
into green discs (13 mm in diameter) under the
pressure of 300 MPa, followed by sintering at
1400 for 2h in air, for densification of the℃
electrolyte.
4.2 Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the
powders was performed using a Netzsch
STA449C simultaneous thermal analyzer at a
heating rate of 10℃ min-1 in air. The
microstructures of the SDC powders were
characterized using X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD) and following the rule of Ni-filtered
CuKα radiation (Rigagu MultiFlex, Japan).
The morphology of the SDC powders was
analyzed using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Hitachi S-3000N, Japan) and a
transmission electron microscope (TEM,
Philips Tecnai G2 F20 FEG-TEM, Netherlands).
The average crystalline size of the powder was
calculated by adopting the XRD data and the
Scherrer formula as follows [22]:
D = 0.9λ / (βcosθ) (1)
where D is the crystaline size, λ the 
wavelength of the incident X-rays
(CuKα;λ=0.15406 nm), θ the difraction angle, 
and β the corected half-width. Relative density
was determined by the Archimedes method.
The composition of the SDC powder was
analyzed using an energy dispersive
spectrometer (Philips Tecnai G2 F20
FEG-TEM). The ionic conductivity of the SDC
electrolytes was determined by an
electrochemical workstation (Hioki 3532-50
LCR Hitester, Japan) at an operation
temperature ranging from 500 to 700 .℃ ℃
5.Results and Discussion
5.1 Characterization of GDC Precursor Powder
Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) powders prepared by
a non-ion selective EDTA-citric complexing
method for intermediate-temperature solid
oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs) were first
investigated. After the evaporation of water at
80℃, the deep yellow gel of the EDTA
complex was obtained. The gel was pre-dried
to a soft gel at 80℃, and the solid precursor
dried at 180℃ for 18 h in air. Thermal analysis
of the soft gel was performed after the
pre-drying at 80℃. Figure 1 shows the
TG-DTA curve of the precursor powder that
was prepared in solution with a pH value of 10.
The corresponding DTA curve had two
endothermic peaks: one at 200℃ for the citrate
and the other at 260℃ for the EDTA complex
formation. The weight loss of these precursors
was nearly 20% in the temperature range of
300 to 500℃. The same results were observed
for other pH values; however, the weight loss
increased with decreasing pH values, from 20%
with a pH of 10 to 78% with a pH of 4,
respectively. Many organic compounds (e.g.,
citrate and EDTA complex) existed in the SDC
cross-section micrographs. The same results
were obtained in the investigation of the
relative density of sintered bodies by the
Archimedes method (Fig. 9). It was found that
the SDC pellets, with powder derived from the
EDTA–citrate–metal precursor calcined at 900
℃ for 3 h, displayed a sintering density of
>95% with a pH of 8 after sintering at 1400℃
for 2 h, and nearly 99% with a pH value of 10.
The morphology of the SDC powders still
exhibited a reticular structure after calcination
at 900℃ with a pH value of 8, compared with
those obtained at other pH values. Therefore,
the pellet exhibited bed sinterability after
calcination. The average grain size from these
images has been summarized in Table 2. It was
found that the average grain size of the pellets
was nearly nano-scale and depended on pH
values. The average grain size was 477~494 nm
for pH values of 4 and 10, 522 nm for a pH of 6,
and 366 nm for a pH of 8, respectively. The
results indicated that the average grain with a
pH of 8 was smaller than that with other pH
values; however, the crystalline size of the SDC
powders after calcination was smaller with a
pH of 8 than that obtained with other pH values,
as depicted in Fig. 6. Usually, a small crystal
with a high surface-activity can grow a larger
grain during the sintering process. However,
the opposite results were found in this work. It
was estimated that factors of grain growth
during the sintering also had the morphology of
powders, except the surface-activity of the
powder, and a large amount of reticular
structure existed in the SDC powders,
inhibiting grain growth with a pH value of 8.
Figure 10 indicates the total electrical
conductivities, at temperatures ranging from
500 to 700℃, of the SDC pellets sintered at
1400℃ for 2 h in air with various pH values in
solution. The Arrhenius relationship can be
expressed asσ=(σ0/T)exp(-Ea/kT), whereσ0
is the pre-exponential factor, Ea the activation
energy, and k the Boltzmann constant.
Furthermore, ln(σT) is plotted against 1000/T,
and a linear relationship should exist. Results
indicated that the electrical conductivity of the
SDC pellets decreased with increasing pH
values, from 6.1×10-3 Scm-1 with a pH of 4 to
3.5×10-3 Scm-1 with a pH of 8, then increased
sharply to 1.0×10-2 Scm-1 at 700℃when the pH
value was 10. The results indicated that
different quantities of organic impurities
affected the microstructure of SDC precursors
synthesized with various pH values. The
resulting microstructure tended to affect the
sinterability and conductivity of the SDC
electrolytes. The electrical conductivity of the
SDC electrolyte mainly depended on the
resistances of bulk (grain, Rb) and grain
boundary (Rgb). The value of Rb was
determined from the bulk arc (higher frequency
region), and that of Rgb was determined from
the grain boundary arc (lower frequency region)
according to the impedance diagram; then they
were converted to bulk (σ b) and grain
boundary (σgb) conductivities (Table 2). It was
obvious that the grain boundary conductivity
was smaller than the bulk conductivity for all
samples synthesized with various pH values;
however, the total electrical conductivity of the
SDC electrolyte depended greatly on the
synthesized condition of the pH value in
solution. Of these samples the best electrical
conductivity was 0.01 Scm-1 at 700℃ with a
pH of 10. A small grain size increased the grain
boundary resistance of the pellet, but no
significant difference existed in grain
conductivity. Similarly, Rambabu et al.
reported that σbulk was less dependent on grain
size, while σbound was greatly dependent on
grain size [25]. A small grain size generated a
high percentage of grain boundary region,
hence, greater grain boundary resistance.
Furthermore, pores or defects in the grain
boundary also increased resistance.
