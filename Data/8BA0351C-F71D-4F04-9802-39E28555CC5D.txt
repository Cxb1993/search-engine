Abstract: 
In this project, we have studied the design of 
the interleaved split-phase/amplitude coded 
modulation for an OFDM system over the 
frequency-selective fading channels with 
additive white Gaussian noise where multiple 
transmit and receive antennas are employed.  
The split-phase/amplitude coded modulation is 
used to take advantage of space and frequency 
diversity gains. In comparison with the existing 
space-time block coded schemes, the proposed 
diversity code is designed under the 
consideration of its low implementation 
complexity while providing a comparable error 
performance to those of the existing STBC 
schemes. The proposed scheme can be regarded 
as a power-efficient coded MIMO-OFDM 
system where OFDM is used to keep the 
diversity replicas orthogonal and reduce ISI 
effects. Analytic and simulation results have 
been presented to show the distinguished error 
performance.  
Keywords: coded modulation, diversity 
technique, OFDM, MIMO, fading channel 
I. Introduction 
Space-time modulation (STM) techniques 
(e.g. [1][2][3]) effectively exploit the spatial 
diversity created by multiple transmit antennas 
over fading channels. Space-time trellis codes 
and space-time block codes (STBC) from 
orthogonal designs are two streams of typical 
examples. In these cases, coding is performed 
across both spatial and time dimensions. STM 
schemes send the transformed copies of the 
signals, which bear the same information bits, at 
K distinct symbol intervals from all the individual 
transmit antennas, and thus K symbol periods of 
the decoding delay is brought about. For example, 
such decoding delay in Alamouti's two-branch 
scheme is two symbol periods. Obviously, this 
decoding delay is related to the dimension of the 
employed STM code. In spite of providing 
maximum diversity and large coding gains, 
space-time trellis codes operate at the expense of 
implementation complexity which also depends

At each symbol interval, the Tn duplicated copies 
of the coded OFDM symbols are modulated and 
emitted each from an individual antenna at the 
same time. Fig. 2 presents the considered 
receiver. The recostructed signal at each receive 
antenna is a noisy superposition of the Tn coded 
OFDM signals corrupted by fading. The 
coherently demodulated output of each receive 
antenna is then fed into an FFT demodulator to 
extract the component of the received signals 
corresponding to nx . Consider the receiver is

Abstract—In this paper, a DFT-based channel estimation (CE) 
with an interference detector is proposed for OFDM systems. 
Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme 
achieves a similar performance as the interference-free case and 
significant enhancement as compared with conventional methods.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [1], 
promising robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) 
and efficiency in spectrum utilization, is a potential technique 
to provide the high-data-rate service, and has become the next 
generation wireless communication standards, e.g., the 
European digital terrestrial television standard [2]. In practice, 
since the OFDM systems usually operate over a frequency-
selective and noisy channel, the channel estimation (CE) is 
indispensable to make the system achieve higher data rates [3]. 
The pilot-based CE, obtained in accordance with the least-
square (LS) criterion, was widely used to achieve a reliable 
performance as long as the pilot signals are correctly obtained 
beforehand [4]. However, its performance significantly 
degrades due to both the intercarrier interference (ICI) and 
noise. As a remedy, the DFT-based CE possessing the high-
resolution interpolation was proposed for the slowly-varying 
noisy channels [5]. Unfortunately, these algorithms fail due to 
the significantly-distorted pilot signals, which are caused by 
strong interference (SI) introduced by the overlay systems or 
intentional jammers [6]. This is because that the erroneous 
channel estimates will lead severe aliasing as the high-
resolution interpolation transformation (DFT) is used.  
In this paper, a DFT-based CE with an interference detector 
is proposed. Specifically, the LS CE is first used to obtain the 
channel frequency response (CFR) of the pilot subcarriers. We 
propose an interference detector to detect existence of SI. As 
the resultant of the interference detector is true, an interference 
remover is then used to block SI. Finally, the DFT-based CE is 
applied to the pre-processed signal chiefly consisting of the 
carrier signals and noise only. The computer simulations are 
given to confirm correctness of the analysis results, and to 
demonstrate its efficacy and robustness against SI. 
II. DATA MODEL AND DFT-BASED CHANNEL ESTIMATION 
The scenario considered herein is an N-subcarrier OFDM 
system using the pilot-based signal correction, in which the 
transmitted information data is encoded into multiamplitude-
multiphase signals (QAM). The data sequence is first encoded 
and then the pilot signals are uniformly inserted. Furthermore, 
the N-point IFFT block converts the pilot-included data 
sequence (in the frequency-domain) into the N parallel data (in 
the time-domain). The guard interval is then inserted to 
combat the multipath effects. Finally, the resultant data is sent 
to a lowpass filter and then transmitted to the communication 
channel. Note that the guard interval is used to eliminate inter-
block-interference and preserve the orthogonality among the 
tones. At the receiver-end, the guard is removed from the 
received symbol, and then the time-domain received data is 
converted into the frequency-domain by FFT. Finally, the 
pilot-based signal correction [1] is performed on the FFT 
processor outputs and the decoder is used to extract the 
transmitted data.  
Assume that total /K N M=  pilot subcarriers of an equal 
complex value α , for simplicity, are uniformly spaced by M  
subcarriers, yielding that the kth subcarrier of the OFDM signal 
is given by

After passing through the channel and removing the guard

the detection ratio γ  versus INR with CNR equal to 30 dB. 
As expected, the values of γ  significantly increase with the 
INR values. This demonstrates that the increment in γ  can be 
used to detect the existence of SI.

B. Proposed Channel Estimation Algorithm 
The LS CE is first used to obtain the CFR on the pilot 
subcarriers. As the resultant of the interference detector is true, 
the CFR of the interfering pilot subcarrier locating at the qth 
pilot subcarrier is replaced by the averaging one of the 
neighboring pilot subcarriers:

With the assumption of the slowly-varying channel used, 
obviously, the CFR of the interfering pilot subcarrier can be

The next step is to apply DFT on the pre-processed CFR, and 
then send to a “low-pass” filter to block the “high frequency” 
signals chiefly contributed by the noise. Finally, the estimated 
CFR of all subcarriers are obtained by performing the N-point 
IDFT on the transformation domain sequence with inserting 
zeros at the “high frequency” region. 
IV. COMPUTER SIMULATION 
Computer simulations were conducted herein to ascertain 
the efficacy of the proposed DFT-based CE scheme with an 
interference detector. Specifically, a 128-subcarrier QPSK-
OFDM system with uniformly-distributed pilot subcarriers was 
employed over the one-path fading channel, in which the pilot 
subcarrier spacing was four (i.e., 4M = ) such that the number 
of all pilot subcarriers was 32 (i.e, 32K = ). A BPSK-
modulated narrowband interference with varied power 2Iσ  was 
impinged at the 6th subcarrier ( 6q = ). The input CNR is fixed 
at 10 dB. For performance evaluation, the efficacy of the 
proposed algorithm was examined by the normalized mean 
squared error (MSE):

For comparison, the results obtained with the optimal 
estimator (without interference case), the LS method 
incorporated with the linear interpolation technique [2], and 
the conventional DFT-based CE [5] were also included.  
The first set of simulations examines the MSE performance 
of the proposed estimator as a function of INR. Each 
simulation result is obtained by 1000 independent trials, with 
each trial using different channel gains and a different set of 
data and noise sequence. The corresponding normalized MSE 
depicted in Fig. 3 indicates that the proposed CE producing a 
similar performance of the optimal estimator can achieve 
excellent robustness against SI. This confirms again that the 
carrier signals can be effectively collected and SI can be 
successfully removed. It is noteworthy that the DFT-based CE
