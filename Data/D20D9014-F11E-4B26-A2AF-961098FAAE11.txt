2Abstract
Bioaerosols are a type of suspended sediments that contribute to poor air quality in Taiwan.
Bioaerosols include allergens such as: fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, arthropods and protozoa, as
well as microbial products such as mycotoxins, endotoxins and glucans. When allergens and
microbial products are suspended in the air, local air quality will be influenced adversely. In
addition, when the particle size is small enough to pass through the respiratory tract entering the
human body, the health of the local population is also threatened. Therefore, the purpose of this
study is to attempt to understand the concentration and types of bacteria and the bacteria numbers
for various particle size ranges during a study period of June 2005 to February 2006 in Taichung
City, Central Taiwan. The results indicate that the total average bacterial concentration by using NA
medium incubated for 48 h were 8.0 × 102, 1.4 × 103, 2.4 × 103 and 1.3 × 103, 1.9 ×
103, 3.5 × 103 cfu/m3 for CMES, TRIPS and RFS sampling sites during the daytime and
nighttime period of June 2005 to February 2006. Moreover, the total average bacterial concentration
by using R2A medium incubated for 48 h were 8.5 × 102, 1.5 × 103, 2.2 × 103 and 1.2 ×
103, 1.7 × 103, 2.5 × 103 cfu/m3 for CMES, TRIPS and RFS sampling sites the daytime and
nighttime during the same sampling period. The total average bacteria concentration was the same
in either NA or R2A medium for the same sampling times or sites. The total average bacterial
concentration was higher in daytime period than that of nighttime period for CMES, TRIPS and
RFS sampling sites. The high average bacterial concentration was found in the particle size range of
0.53–0.71 mm (average bioaerosol size was in the range of 2.1–4.7 μm) for each sampling site.
Also, 20 kinds of bacteria exceeded levels for each sampling site and were classified as according to
shape: rod, coccus and filamentous.

4Taichung Harbor Road and Chung-Ming Nan Road on the side of Chung-Ming elementary.
Taichung Harbor Road and Chung-Ming Nan Road have a traffic density of 10,000 vehicles per
hour during the sampling period. TRIPS is located on the west side of Taichung City. It is near the
entrance of the Taichung Refuse Incineration Plant and on the side of Wen-Shen Golf Course.
Garbage trucks often pass by the front of the site at a density of 80 vehicles per hour. RFS is located
on the northwest side of Taichung City. It is near a rice field, and the traffic density is very low
(about 120 vehicles per hour).
Sampling process
Samples were taken during the period of 30 June, 2005 to 11 February, 2006. The sampling
times were 8–12 a.m. and 6–10 p.m. The total number ofsampling days was 17. The height of the all
sampling sites is approximately 1.5 m above ground level. The average humidity and temperature at
the sampling sites during the period of June 2005 to February 2006 are shown in Table 1.
Each collection plate, with the cover removed, is inserted on each stage of the sampling
instrument. After starting the pump, the air to be sampled enters the inlet cone and cascades through
the succeeding orifice stages with successively higher orifice velocities from stages 1 to 6.
Successively smaller particles are inertially impacted onto the NA (R2A) collection surfaces. Viable
particles are retained on the agar plates, and the exhaust air is carried through the vacuum hose to
the vacuum source. The flow rate is 28.3 L/min and the sampling time is 3 min. After the sampling
is complete, the NA (R2A) collection plates are removed from the sampling instrument, and the
cover is replaced on each Petri dish. All agar plates are inverted to prevent condensation drip then
placed in an incubator at 35◦C for 12–60 h. After incubation, the number of colonies on each plate
is counted using a standard bacterial colony counter. The average number of viable particles
(aerobic bacteria) per unit volume of air is calculated using the following formula: the average
concentration of bacteria (cfu/m3) = number of colony (cfu) ×1000 (l/m3) /[28.3 (l/ min) ×3 min]
To measure the bacterial numbers for various particle size ranges, the average bacterial
concentration was calculated in terms of dn/d log dp (where n is the average bacterial concentration
at 48 h; and p is the particle size). The preparation of experiment, sampling and the calculation of
the total bacterial number were all conducted with caution. And the procedure for all the researchers
is needed to be aseptic with 70% ethanol. Besides, this aseptic procedure was carried out three times
prior to each sampling period.
Result and discussions
CMES
Table 2 shows the average concentration of bacteria for daytime and nighttime sampling
periods at the CMES sampling site during June 2005 to February 2006 by using NA and R2A
medium. While the unit area bacterial number for different incubated time at various particles size
ranges isalso presented, the results show that the average bacterial concentration increased as the
incubated time increased for each particle size ranges. This result is independent of sampling times
and medium types.
Table 3 shows the unit particle size average for bacterial concentrations at 48 h incubation time
during daytime and nighttime periods at the CMES sampling site during June 2005 to February2006
6NA and R2A media. Total average bacterial concentration is the sum of the average bacterial
concentration for each particle size ranges. According to Fig. 3, the results indicate that the total
average bacterial concentration increased as the incubated time increased. This result is independent
of sampling site, sampling time and medium type. Compared to the rest of the other sampling sites,
the result revealed that the RFS has the highest bacterial concentration (when the medium was NA,
the total average bacterial concentrations at 48-h incubation time during daytime and nighttime
periods were 8.0 × 102, 1.4 × 103, 2.4 ×103 and 1.3 × 103, 1.9 × 103, 3.5 × 103 cfu/m3 for
sampling sites of CMES, TRIPS and RFS, respectively. When the medium was R2A, the total
average bacterial concentrations at 48-h incubation time during daytime and nighttime periods were
8.5 × 102, 1.5 × 103, 2.2 × 103 and 1.2 ×103, 1.7 × 103, 2.5 × 103 cfu/m3 for sampling sites
of CMES, TRIPS and RFS, respectively). The postulated reason here is that this sampling site is
near the rice ground. The high concentration of bacteria was tended to be founded in straw. In
addition, the straw reaping and burning were usually caused the high concentration of bacteria in
the atmospheric environment. The above-mentioned factors lead to the high total average bacterial
concentration at the RFS sampling site. However, the high concentration of bacteria found at the
TRIPS sampling site was caused by garbage trucks passing by during the sampling period, landfill
size, incinerator and the nearby golf course. Although a high concentration (104 cfu/m3) of bacteria
was found at the RFS sampling site, this value did not exceed 104 cfu/m3 regulated in 1986 by
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist (Lin et al. 2004). Thus, it will likely
not impact the surrounding local ecosystem.
Figure 3 also indicates that the total average bacterial concentration was the same in either NA
or R2A media for the same sampling times or sites. In addition, it also shows that the total average
bacterial concentration was higher in daytime period than that of nighttime period for CMES,
TRIPS and RFS sampling sites. The proposed reason still needs further studies to verify the cause
of this finding.
Tables 3, 5 and 7 indicate that high average bacterial concentrations were found in the particle
size range of 0.53–0.71 mm (average bioaerosol size was in the range of 2.1–4.7 μm). In general,
aerosols which are greater than 3 μm are easily deposited in bronchial passages, while aerosols
which are less than 3 μm in size are easily deposited in pulmonary alveola (Heyder et al. 1986).
Though the average bacterial concentration obtained at three sampling sites may have no significant
impact to local ecosystem, the influence on lung disease patients still needs further study.
Conclusions
The total average bacterial concentration were 8.0 × 102, 1.4 × 103 and 2.4 × 103 cfu/m3
by using NA medium incubated for 48 h at sampling sites of CMES, TRIPS and RFS during the
daytime period of June 2005 to February 2006. The total average bacterial concentration were 1.3 ×
103, 1.9 × 103 and 3.5 × 103 cfu/m3 by using NA medium incubated for 48 h at sampling sites of
CMES, TRIPS and RFS during the nighttime period of June 2005 to February 2006.
The total average bacterial concentration were 8.5 × 102, 1.5 × 103 and 2.2 × 103 cfu/m3
by using R2A medium incubated for 48 h at sampling sites of CMES, TRIPS and RFS during the
daytime period of June 2005 to February 2006.
