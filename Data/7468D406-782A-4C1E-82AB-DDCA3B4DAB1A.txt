I. INTRODUCTION
Unknown input ﬁltering has played a signiﬁcant
role in many applications, e.g., bias compensation
(Friedland, 1969; Hsieh & Chen, 1999), geophysical
and environmental applications (Kitanidis, 1987),
and fault detection and isolation problems (Chen &
Patton, 1996). To be more general, it may not be
any knowledge concerning the model of the unknown
input.
A common approach to solve this unknown input
ﬁltering problem is to produce the unknown input
decoupled state estimation, which may be achieved
by making use of unbiased minimum-variance es-
timation (Kitanidis, 1987; Chen & Patton, 1996;
Darouach & Zasadzinski, 1997; Hsieh, 2000; Gillijns
& De Moor, 2007a). In this approach, the ﬁlter
parameters are ﬁrst determined to satisfy some al-
gebraic constraints according to the unbiasedness
condition of the ﬁlter. Next, the parameter matrices
are determined in such a way that the state estimation
error variance is minimum. It is shown that the
results presented by Kitanidis (1987), Darouach and
Zasadzinski (1997), and Hsieh (2000) are globally
optimal for systems with unknown inputs that only
affect the system state (Kerwin & Prince, 2000;
Gillijns & De Moor, 2007a). It should be noted that
in the above works, only those of Hsieh (2000) and
Gillijns and De Moor (2007a) explicitly address the
problem of joint input and state estimation.
Trying to extend the aforementioned optimal ﬁlters
to the case where unknown inputs affect both the
system state and the output, Darouach, Zasadzinski,
and Boutayeb (2003) have applied the previously
proposed parameterizing technique to derive the op-
timal estimator ﬁlter (OEF). More recently, Gillijns
and De Moor (2007b) have also proposed a recursive
three-step ﬁlter (RTSF) to solve the problem of joint
input and state estimation for systems with direct
feedthrough of the unknown input to the output. It
is noted that the RTSF is less restrictive than the
OEF since the estimation of the state and the un-
known input are interconnected in the former, which
may yield better ﬁltering performance. However, the
RTSF is applicable only to the case that the direct
feedthrough matrix (of the unknown input to the
output) has full rank. Some other approaches have
also been used to solve the addressed unknown input
ﬁltering problem, e.g., the minimax-optimal method
(Borisov & Pankov, 1994), the equivalent system
description and innovations ﬁltering method (Hou
& Patton, 1998), and the time-delayed optimal state
estimator design method (Sundaram & Hadjicostis,
2006).
In this technical communique, we intend to present
an extension of the RTSF (ERTSF) based on the
approaches developed by Gillijns and De Moor
(2007b) and Darouach, Zasadzinski, and Boutayeb
(2003) to estimate both the system state and the
unknown input. The result is applicable to the gen-
eral case where not only unknown inputs affect both
the system state and the output, but also the direct
feedthrough matrix has arbitrary rank. Moreover, the
relationship between the ERTSF and the ﬁlters in
Borisov and Pankov (1994), Darouach, Zasadzinski,
and Boutayeb (2003), and Hou and Patton (1998) is
also addressed.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
Consider the linear discrete-time stochastic time-
varying system with unknown inputs in the form
xk+1 = Akxk + Gkdk + wk, (1)
yk = Ckxk + Hkdk + vk, (2)
where xk ∈ Rn is the state vector, dk ∈ Rm
is an unknown input vector, and yk ∈ Rp is the
measurement vector. The process noise wk ∈ Rn
and the measurement noise vk ∈ Rp are assumed
to be mutually uncorrelated, zero-mean, white ran-
dom signals with known covariance matrices, Qk =
E[wkwTk ] ≥ 0 and Rk = E[vkvTk ] > 0, respectively.
The matrices Ak, Gk, Ck, and Hk are known and it
is assumed that (Ak, Ck) is observable and that x0
is independent of vk and wk for all k. Moreover,
an unbiased estimate x˘0 of the initial state x0 is
available with covariance matrix P x0 .
Recently, to solve the addressed problem, Gillijns
and De Moor (2007b) proposed the following RTSF:
Step 1: Estimation of unknown input
R˜k = CkP xk|k−1C
T
k + Rk, (3)
Mk = (HTk R˜
−1
k Hk)
−1HTk R˜
−1
k , (4)
dˆk|k = Mk(yk − Ckxˆk|k−1), (5)
P dk|k = (H
T
k R˜
−1
k Hk)
−1. (6)
Step 2: Measurement update
Kk = P xk|k−1C
T
k R˜
−1
k , (7)
xˆk|k = xˆk|k−1 + Kk
×(yk − Ckxˆk|k−1 −Hkdˆk|k), (8)
P xk|k = P
x
k|k−1 −Kk(R˜k −HkP dk|kHTk )KTk ,(9)
(P dxk|k) = (P
xd
k|k)
T = −(KkHkP dk|k)T . (10)
2
There exists matrices M∗k and L
∗
k satisfying (27) and
(28) if and only if
rank[Sk] = rank[Hk] + rank[Gk−1Πk−1],
which can be obtained by using the approach of
Darouach, Zasadzinski, and Boutayeb (2003).
Third, we consider the minimum-variance unbi-
ased state estimation. Using (22)-(24) and (27)-(28),
the expressions for (6), (9), and (10) are updated,
respectively, as
P dk|k = E[(d˜k|k −Πkdk)(d˜k|k −Πkdk)T ]
= M∗k R˜k(M
∗
k )
T , (29)
P xk|k = E[x˜k|kx˜
T
k|k]
= P xk|k−1 − L∗kR˜k(L∗k)T + L∗kΨk
+(L∗kΨk)
T , (30)
P dxk|k = E[(d˜k|k −Πkdk)x˜Tk|k] = M∗kΨk, (31)
where
Ψk = R˜k(L∗k)
T − CkP xk|k−1. (32)
We are now in place to derive the gain matrix L∗k.
Applying the approach of Kitanidis (1987) and using
(28) and (30), we form the following linear system
of equations:[
R˜k −Sk
STk 0
] [
(L∗k)
T
ΛTk
]
=
[
CkP
x
k|k−1
ΓTk
]
, (33)
where Λk is the matrix of Lagrange multipliers. The
system (33) has a unique solution if and only if
STk R˜
−1
k Sk is nonsingular. In general, this condition
does not hold. To remedy this problem, the Moore-
Penrose pseudo-inverse M+ is used instead of the
inverse M−1. Thus, the gain matrix L∗k is obtained
as follows:
L∗k = Kk + (Γk −KkSk)S∗k , (34)
where
S∗k = (S
T
k R˜
−1
k Sk)
+STk R˜
−1
k . (35)
It remains to determine the gain matrix M∗k . Ac-
cording to the well-known matrix equation solution
theory (Rao & Mitra, 1971), the general solution of
M∗k to (27) is
M∗k =
[
Φk 0m
]
S∗k + Zk(Ip − SkS∗k), (36)
where Zk is an arbitrary matrix. Using (36) and
solving (29) for Zk that minimizes the trace of P dk|k,
we obtain Zk = 0. Using this optimal Zk and (27),
we obtain[
Φk 0m
]
(I − S∗kSk) = 0. (37)
One possible solution of the matrix Φk satisfying
(37) is given as Φk = H+k Hk, by which we obtain
M∗k =
[
H+k Hk 0m
]
S∗k , (38)
Sk =
[
Hk CkGk−1(Im −H+k−1Hk−1)
]
,(39)
Γk =
[
0n×m Gk−1(Im −H+k−1Hk−1)
]
.(40)
Using (25), (27)-(28), and (37)-(38), we obtain
ΞkΠk−1 = H+k CkΓk(I − S∗kSk)
[
0 I
]′
= 0.
Finally, the proposed ERTSF is given by (3), (7),
(11)-(12), (17)-(18), (29)-(32), (34)-(35), and (38)-
(40).
Remark 2. The above ERTSF can be slightly
modiﬁed and applied to the following linear dynamic
indeterminate-stochastic system (ISS) (Borisov &
Pankov, 1994):
xk = Akxk−1 + Gkdk + wk,
yk = Ckxk + Hkdk + vk.
This is achieved by replacing the time update equa-
tions (11) and (12), respectively, with
xˆk+1|k = Akxˆk|k, P xk+1|k = AkP
x
k|kA
T
k + Qk, (41)
system matrices Sk (39) and Γk (40), respectively,
with
S˜k =
[
Hk CkGk
] [
I I
]T
,
Γ˜k =
[
0 Gk
] [
I I
]T
,
and by using the following substitutions: Ak →
Ak+1, Gk → Gk+1, and Qk → Qk+1 in the ERTSF.
IV. RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EXISTING
LITERATURE RESULTS
A. Gillijns and De Moor (2007b)
Consider the special case that the matrix Hk is
of full column rank, i.e., rank[Hk] = m. Then, we
have Πk = 0 for all k ≥ 0, and hence one has the
following gain relationships:
M∗k = Mk, L
∗
k = Kk(I −HkMk).
Moreover, it can be easily veriﬁed that the matrices
(29), (30), and (31) are equivalent to the correspond-
ing covariance matrices given in (6), (9), and (10),
respectively. Thus, the ERTSF will be equivalent to
the RTSF.
4
hold, the ERTSF, which is given by (3), (7), (11)-
(12), (17)-(18), (29)-(32), (34)-(35), and (38)-(40),
is equivalent to the OLMVE, that is referenced by
(55)-(65).
Proof. It sufﬁces to verify that Lk, x¯k+1|k, and
P˘k+1 are equivalent to L∗k, xˆk+1|k, and P
x
k+1|k,
respectively.
Using (59), (65), and (68), we obtain
Lk = ΓkS∗k + (P˘kC
T
k R˘
−1
k − ΓkS∗k)(I − SkS∗k). (69)
Using (27)-(28) and (67)-(68), we obtain
Mk = H+k (Sk − CkΓk)S∗k
=
[
H+k Hk 0m
]
S∗k . (70)
Using (59), (61), and (65)-(67), we have
RkL
T
k − CkPk = (I − CkLk)Ψ¯k,
Ψ¯k = R˘kLTk − CkP˘k,
H+k (I − CkLk) = H+k RkT¯ Tk R¯+k T¯k + Mk,
by which P˘k+1 in (58) can be reformulated as
P˘k+1 = AkPkATk + Qk + GkMkΨ¯kA

where
Δk = H+k RkT¯
T

[

Using (69)-(72), one can easily verify by induction
that Lk, x¯k+1|k, and P˘k+1 are equivalent to L∗k,
xˆk+1|k, and P xk+1|k, respectively.
V. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
Consider the numerical example given by
Darouach, Zasadzinski, and Boutayeb (2003). In this
simulation, three cases of Hk, i.e., Hk = H1k =
diag(0, 1), Hk = H2k = diag(1, 0), and Hk =
H3k = I2, and the ﬁlters OEF, OLMVE, RTSF
∗,
ERTSF, and the TDOSE (time-delayed optimal state
estimator) given by Sundaram and Hadjicostis (2006)
are considered. We list the root-mean-square-errors
(rmse) in the state estimates of the aforementioned
ﬁlters in Table 1, where the estimator delay α of the
TDOSE is chosen by 1, 1, and 0 for H1k , H
2
k , and
H3k , respectively.
From Table 1, we may conclude the following
results.
1) The TDOSE and the OEF have similar perfor-
mances for α = 1 and may not give the best
performance.

2) Except for the special case GkΠk = Gk (Hk =
H1k ) the OEF has the worst performance.
3) The RTSF∗ may not give the best performance.
4) The ﬁltering performances of the ERTSF and
the OLMVE are the same; both give the best
performance. Note that the former also explic-
itly gives the unknown input estimates.

A Uniﬁed Extension of The Robust Two-Stage Kalman Filter and Its
Application to Functional Filtering
Chien-Shu Hsieh
Abstract—This paper extends previous work on robust two-
stage Kalman ﬁlter (RTSKF) for systems with unknown inputs
affecting both the system state and the output. By making use
of an augmented known input model, an augmented unknown
input model, an unknown input error dynamics model, and
the previously proposed RTSKF, a uniﬁed extension of the
RTSKF is further proposed to enhance the unknown input
ﬁltering performance. Through the global optimality analysis
technique, the conditions under which the unknown input ﬁlter
and the system state estimator of the RTSKF can both achieve
the globally optimal ﬁltering performances are provided. An
application of this new RTSKF to functional ﬁltering problem
is addressed.
I. INTRODUCTION
Unknown inputs ﬁltering (UIF) has played a signiﬁcant
role in many applications, e.g., bias compensation [1], [2],
geophysical and environmental applications [3], fault de-
tection and isolation problems [4], and functional ﬁltering
[5]. Except for the ﬁrst above-mentioned application, the
UIF problem is often solved by assuming that no prior
information about the unknown input is available, which is
the main concern of this paper.
A general approach to solve the state estimation for
unknown inputs that have arbitrary statistics is to apply
unknown inputs decoupled state estimation, in which four
major approaches have been used in the literature: the ﬁrst is
unbiased minimum-variance estimation (UMVE) [3], [4], [6],
[7], [8], [9], the second is the equivalent system description
(ESD) method [10], [11], the third is designed based on state
estimation techniques for descriptor systems [12], and the
last is joint input and state estimation (JISE) [13], [14], [15],
[16]. For the description of the above approaches and papers,
see [17] for further information.
In this paper, we continue the previous research [13],
[16], [17] and further consider a uniﬁed extension of the
previously proposed RTSKF [13] to solve general unknown
input ﬁltering problems that the unknown input may also
affect the output. It is shown that using an augmented
known input model, an augmented unknown input model,
an unknown input error dynamics model, and the RTSKF, a
uniﬁed extension of the RTSKF is proposed to enhance the
unknown input ﬁltering performance. The issue of global
optimality concerning the unknown input and system state

estimators of this RTSKF is also explored. Through this new
RTSKF, a reﬁned version of the previously proposed uniﬁed
two-stage functional ﬁlter (UTSFF) [5] is further proposed
to enhance the functional ﬁltering performance.
II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Consider the discrete-time stochastic linear time-varying
system with unknown inputs in the form
xk+1 = Akxk + Bkuk + Fkdk + wk (1)
yk = Hkxk + Gkdk + vk (2)
where xk ∈ Rn is the system state, uk ∈ Rm is the known
input, dk ∈ Rq is the unknown input, and yk ∈ Rp is the
output. wk and vk are uncorrelated white noises sequences
of zero-mean and covariance matrices Qk ≥ 0 and Rk > 0,
respectively. The initial state x0 is with unbiased mean xˆ0
and covariance matrix P x0 and is independent of wk and vk.
The problem of interest in this paper is to design an
optimal state estimator of xk, denoted by xk|k, such that
tr(P xk|k) = tr(E[eke
′
k]) is minimized under the unbiasedness
condition E[ek] = 0, where ek = xk − xk|k and ′ denotes
transpose. The ﬁlter considered in this paper is given as the
following RTSKF ﬁlter:
xk|k = x¯k|k + Vkdk|k
P xk|k = P
x¯
k|k + VkP
d
k|kV
′
k
where x¯k|k, dk|k, P x¯k|k, P
d
k|k, and Vk are to be determined;
this extends the original ﬁlter [13] to more general systems
with direct feedthrough of the unknown input to the output.
The main aims of this paper are 1) to derive a uniﬁed
extension of the RTSKF in [13] to solve the more general
unknown input ﬁltering problem, 2) to explore the optimality
issue of the obtained new RTSKF, and 3) to enhance the
ﬁltering performance of the two-stage functional ﬁltering
problem [5] by using the proposed RTSKF.
III. A UNIFIED EXTENSION OF THE RTSKF
First, we give an optimal estimate of the unknown input
as follows (see [16] for details):
dˆk = Mk(yk −Hkx¯k|k−1) (3)
P dk = MkCkM

where the matrix G1k is of full column rank. This is achieved
by using the similar approach in deriving (15)-(16) to obtain
an alternative to the system (35)-(36) as follows:
xk+1 = Akxk + B¯ku¯k + F¯kd¯k + wk (37)
yk = Hkxk + G¯kd¯k + vk (38)
where B¯k =
[
Bk F
1
k
]
, F¯k =
[
0 F 2k
]
, G¯k =[
G1k 0
]
, u¯k =
[
u′k (dˆ
1
k)
′ ]′, d¯k = [ (d1k)′ (d2k)′ ]′.
And then, applying the RTSKF (17)-(32) to the system (37)-
(38), we obtain the dedicate result. Note that in this speciﬁc
RTSKF, the system parameters Φk, Sk, and Vk are given as
Φk = I, Sk =
[
G1k HkF
2
k−1
]
Vk =
[ −K x¯kG1k (I −K x¯kHk)F 2k−1 ] .
IV. ON THE GLOBAL OPTIMALITY OF THE
UNKNOWN INPUT ESTIMATOR
In this section, we show the global optimality of the
unknown input estimator of the new proposed RTSKF by
verifying that it satisﬁes the following requirements:
E[dk − dˆk] = 0, min E[||dk − dˆk||2]
within the general framework for obtaining the linear
minimum-variance unbiased (LMVU) estimate of dk as
addressed in [18]. The derivation basically follows those of
[18] and [14].
First, we note that the most general estimate of dk can be
written in the form (see [14] for details):
dˆk = Mky˜k +
k−1∑
i=0
Diy˜i + E0xˆ0, (39)
where y˜k = yk − Hkx¯k|k−1. A necessary and sufﬁcient
condition for (39) to be an unbiased estimator of dk is given
in the following lemma.
Lemma 1: The estimator (39) is unbiased if and only if
E0 = 0 and Mk and Di (0 ≤ i ≤ k−1) satisfy the following
conditions:
Mk
[
Gk HkF˜k−1
]
=
[
I −Dk−1Gk−1
]
,
Di+1Hi+1F˜i = −DiGi (0 ≤ i ≤ k − 2). (40)
Proof: Using (1), (2), and (19), we obtain
y˜k = Hk(Ak−1ek−1 + wk−1 + Fk−1d˜k−1) + vk
+Gkdk. (41)
Using (6), (13), and the facts: E[ei] = 0, E[wi] = 0, and
E[vi+1] = 0 for i < k, and substituting (41) into (39), we
obtain
E[dˆk] = MkGkdk + (MkHkF˜k−1 + Dk−1Gk−1)dk−1
+
k−2∑
i=0
(Di+1Hi+1F˜i + DiGi)di + E0xˆ0
from which we obtain that the estimator (39) is unbiased if
and only if E0 = 0 and Mk and Di satisfy (40).
Next, to proceed to show the conditions under which
the unbiased estimator (39) can achieve the minimum mean
square error (MMSE), we have the following lemma.
Lemma 2: For every i < k and every Di satisfying DiSi =
0, E[y˜k(Diy˜i)′] = 0 and E[dk(Diy˜i)′] = 0.
Proof: Deﬁning notations y¯i and e¯i as follows:
y¯i = Hie¯i + vi, e¯i = Ai−1ei−1 + wi−1 + Fi−1d˜i−1 (42)
we have
E[e¯ie¯′i] = P
x¯
i|i−1, E[e¯iv
′
i] = 0. (43)
Using (1), (17), (20), (26), (29), and (42), we obtain the error
dynamics ei as follows:
ei = (I − LiHi)e¯i − Livi (44)
where Li = K x¯i + ViK
d
i . Using (44) in (42) yields
e¯i+1 = Ai(I − LiHi)e¯i −AiLivi + wi + Fid˜i (45)
from which and using (43), we obtain
E[e¯ie¯′j ] = Ai−1(I − Li−1Hi−1)E[e¯i−1e¯′j ] (46)
E[e¯iv′j ] = Ai−1(I − Li−1Hi−1)E[e¯i−1v′j ]
−Ai−1Li−1E[vi−1v′j ] (47)
where i > j. Then, we note that
E[dk(Diy˜i)′] = dkd′i(DiGi)
′ = 0
E[y˜k(Diy˜i)′] = HkE[e¯ky¯′i]D
′
i. (48)
Using (7), (22), (27), (42), (43), and (45)-(47), we obtain
E[e¯ky¯′i] = A¯(k − 1, i)(E[e¯i+1e¯′i]H ′i + E[e¯i+1v′i])
= A¯(k − 1, i)(A¯iP x¯i|i−1H ′i −AiLiRi)
= A¯(k − 1, i)Ai(P x¯i|i−1H ′i −K x¯i Ci − ViKdi Ci)
= −A¯(k − 1, i)AiViP di|iS′i (49)
where A¯i = Ai(I − LiHi) and
A¯(m,n) = A¯m × · · · × A¯n+1, m > n, A¯(m,m) = I.
Using (49) in (48) yields that E[y˜k(Diy˜i)′] = 0 if all Di(i <
k) satisfying DiSi = 0.
Finally, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1: Let rank[Gk] = q and dˆk given by (39) be
unbiased, then the mean square error σ2k = E[‖dk − dˆk‖22]
achieves a minimum when D0 = D1 = · · · = Dk−1 = 0.
Proof: Using F˜k = 0, Lemmas 1 and 2, and the proof of
[14,Theorem 10], the theorem is proved.
V. ON THE GLOBAL OPTIMALITY OF THE STATE
ESTIMATOR
In this section, we show the global optimality of the state
estimator of the new proposed RTSKF by verifying that it
satisﬁes the following requirements:
E[xk − xk|k] = 0, min E[||xk − xk|k||2]
within the general framework for obtaining the LMVU
estimate of xk as addressed in [18]. The derivation basically
follows that of [18].

A. Rank Condition (62) Holds
Assuming that the rank condition (62) holds, and
one can ﬁnd suitable matrices Γk and Dˆk, where
rank
[
Γ′k Dˆ
′
k
]′
= dim(yk), such that[
y¯1k

=
[

[
Γk

ηk (63)
where y¯1k = Γkyk, y¯
2
k = Dˆkyk, and
D¯k = DˆkCkHk, C¯k = DˆkCkGk, Γkηk = 0
then, applying the GTSKF [20] to the system [(59), (60), and
(63)], one obtains the following OROF:
zk|k−1 = A¯k−1zk−1|k−1 + B¯k−1uk−1 + F¯k−1y¯1k−1(64)
zk|k = zk|k−1 + Kzk(y

where
yzk =

(69)
Rzk =
[
P dk|k−1 − K˜zkP zk|k−1(K˜zk)′ 0

]
(70)
in which
dk|k−1 = A˜k−1zk−1|k−1 + F˜k−1y¯1k−1 + B˜k−1uk−1 (71)
P dk|k−1 = A˜k−1P

Note that the above OROF (64)-(73) is an alternative to
that given in [5,(50)-(59)]. Moreover, using dk|k−1 = 0,
P dk|k−1 = 0, D¯k = 0, and Γkηk = 0 in the above OROF
and replacing (66) with the following
P zk|k−1 = A¯k−1P

one obtains the SOROF in [5,(62)-(65)].
In the following, we show that (65) and (68) can be fur-
ther simpliﬁed by using the two-stage measurement update
equations, i.e., [20,(73)-(80)], respectively, as follows:
zk|k = z˜k|k + K¯zk(y¯
2
k − D¯ky¯1k − C¯kz˜k|k) (74)
P zk|k = (I − K¯zk C¯k)P˜ zk|k (75)
where
z˜k|k = zk|k−1 + K˜zk(y¯

B. Rank Condition (62) Does Not Hold
Assuming that the rank condition (62) does not hold, then
the ﬁrst equation of (63) is discarded by using Γk = 0 and
Dˆk = Im. Thus, (63) reduces to
y¯2k = C¯kzk + D¯kdk + Dˆkηk. (79)
Applying the new proposed RTSKF (17)-(32) to the system
[(60) and (79)], one obtains

Finally, combining the OROF [(64), (66), (71)-(73), and
(74)-(78)] and the RTSKF [(80)-(93)] into a uniﬁed result, a
reﬁned version of the previous proposed UTSFF [5] is given
