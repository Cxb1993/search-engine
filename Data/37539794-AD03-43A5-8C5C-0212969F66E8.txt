macro scale applications with three-dimensional, multi-degree- 
-of-freedom motion, the potential of hooked type fingers will 
be realized in this paper. This paper also extends our conference 
paper [22] with added focus on self-sensing and 
implementation. Begin from Sec. II, we computationally 
analyze and design a monolithic microgripper actuated by 
distributed SMA wires. In Sec. III, the gripper is fabricated for 
motion and contact force characterization. A resistance to 
contraction force relation is established in Sec. IV to self-sense 
SMA force for gripping range control. Finally in Sec. V, a 
self-powered gripper module is demonstrated by showing 
several manipulation tasks. The specifications of our gripper 
are listed in the last row of Table 1.  
II. SMA WIRE ACTUATED GRIPPER DESIGN 
We begin by presenting a model for the proposed 
two-fingered microgripper. The model predicts SMA strain and 
finger deflection given a SMA contraction force.  Based on this 
model, gripper initial shape and SMA wire dimension are 
optimally designed to achieve high range to length ratio with 
sufficient gripping force.  
2.1 Finger model 
Fig. 1 shows a finger schematic with end view. The finger 
consists of three straight columns that connect two flexible 
segments from position n1 to n2 to n3. Each column has length Δ 
and the overall span of the finger is L. To distribute the 
actuation force evenly, the end of each column is attached with 
a hook to guide SMA wires. A SMA wire goes from position n0 
to n4 and then back to n0. It is denoted as a V-shaped wire since 
the route looks like a V from the end view. The wire exerts 
forces at n4 and n5. It is equivalent to two SMA wires 
connecting separately from n0 to n4, except that the V-shaped 
wire can be conveniently actuated at n0. The initial shape of the 
two flexible segments are characterized by functions η1(u) and 
η2(u) where u [0 1] is the non-dimensional arc length along a 
segment and η is the corresponding slope (in terms of radians). 
For example, η = c0 indicates a straight segment; η = c0 + c1u 
indicates a segment shape that is a circular arc (c0 and c1 are 
constants). Higher order shapes can be further expected. As the 
wire contracts, it behaves like a tendon pulling the finger. Since 
the flexural rigidities of the columns are much higher, the 
manipulation relies on the deflection of the two flexible 
segments. A different initial segment shape (different η(u)) 
would exhibit a different deflection. 
The hooks are made by drilling two holes at the end of each 
column. The wire goes through the holes and both ends of the 
wire are attached on the same side for power input. The holes 
are assumed to be in frictionless contact with the SMA wire. 
Thus the contraction force remains the same everywhere along 
the wire. The resultant force from the two halves of the 
V-shaped wire is denoted as F. The flexible segments are 
modeled as beams (represented by its neutral axis) and 
analyzed by the generalized multiple shooting method 
[23]−[24], which is capable of predicting accurate beam large 
deflection. The merits of this method have been shown by 
comparing with other numerical methods. For our finger model, 
the deflected shape is determined by a given F. Detailed 
solution formulations to solve for the deflected shape are 
derived in the appendix. They are employed to calculate the 
simulations presented in the rest of this work. 
Once the deflected shape of the finger is obtained, we can 
calculate the deformed positions ni = [nxi nyi] (i=4−5). The 
shortened length of the SMA wire is obtained as

On the right hand side of (1), the length Lex is a fixed value 
while the other two terms decrease with increasing magnitude 
of deflection. To distinguish LS from the un-actuated length, we 
denote LSi as the SMA wire length before actuation. The strain δ 
of the SMA wire can be defined as follows. 
 1 / 100%S SiL L     (2)
Usually the strain is 4% for a wire type SMA. The bending 
angle of the finger depends both on F and the strain δ. The 
above model relies on a given (measured) F in order to 
calculate SMA strain and finger deflection. The merit of this 
approach is that the force measurement is more precise and 
convenient than strain or deflection at a smaller scale.  
2.2 Design of finger initial configuration 
Based on the model in Sec. 2.1, we propose a finger shape 
design given a specified SMA wire length. Ideally, the SMA 
wire can be made very long (by extending Lex) to produce a

for example) of phase transformation. Operation using partial 
strain can also benefit from the notable increase of SMA wires 
fatigue life than full strain [26]. Since strain is proportional to 
SMA temperature, partial strain further prevents SMA from 
overheating that would thermally deform the finger.  
The length of SMA wire in our proposed finger is 2(Lex+L). 
By fixing the finger length to 1cm, a proper wire length 
depends on the choice of Lex. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the 
length Lex on the required SMA strain in order to achieve 
specified contraction forces (F = 3.04 N and 3.82 N). Take F = 
3.82 N as an example, length of Lex less than 2 cm is infeasible 
because strain is limited by 4%. As Lex increases, the required 
strain gradually decreases.  The rate of decrease becomes much 
smaller when Lex further increases up to 6 cm. Thus a wire 
length up to 6cm is practically unnecessary. In our design we 
choose to manipulate within 1.67% strain. At this strain, Lex = 
6.28 cm is required to produce a force that bends the finger to 
its maximum allowable extent (SF = 1.2). For convenience we 
choose Lex = 6 cm; the wire length is 14 cm.  
III. MOTION AND FORCE CHARACTERIZATIONS 
We consider two fingers, different mainly in thickness, with 
specifications listed in Table 2. Finger 2 is the one we specified 
in Sec. 2. Finger 1 is 0.1 mm thicker with a slightly smaller 
curvature for the arc segments. Both are fabricated by using a 
CO2 laser cutting machine (M-300, Universal Laser Systems) 
with 48 W power and 80 mm/s cutting speed. The matching 
number of power and speed are to ensure straightness of finger 
cross-section. The hooks are made by laser-drilling two holes at 
distance 0.9 mm from the top of the columns. 
Since the manufactured finger may not be precisely of the 
same dimension as designed, a sensitivity analysis is required 
to identify the most critical dimension that would affect finger 
deflection. From the model in Sec. 2.1, the dimensions that 
would greatly affect finger tip displacement are the in-plane 
thickness t and column length Δ. Given an F, the displacement 
D can be expressed as a function of t and Δ. For both fingers, 
the sensitivities to tip displacement are defined as follows. 
( , ) /t FS D t t    ; ( , ) / FS D t      (3)
The partial derivatives in (3) are calculated in a finite difference 
fashion. For the allowable force range, the sensitivities are 
plotted in Fig. 7. Apparently, the sensitivity of t is much higher 
than Δ for both fingers. For Finger 2 with F = 2.76 N, a 0.01 
mm difference of t would cause a 0.25 mm difference of D. 
Note that since Finger 1 is thicker than Finger 2, the sensitivity 
(St)1 is smaller than (St)2.   
To study the motion characteristics, we set up an experiment 
platform shown in Fig. 8(a). A computer-based LabVIEW 
system gives voltage commands through a NI PCI-6229 card, 
which controls the power to the SMA wire from a standard 
power supply. A force sensor (Futek LSB 200, ±0.1% accuracy, 
±5 mN noise error) is screw-connected to the SMA wire of each 
finger to measure the contraction force. A microscope captures 
the images (640480 pixels, 7.634 μm resolution) and 
measures the finger deflection through standard image 
processing techniques. The linear stage adjusts the pretension 
force Fp for the SMA wire. Figs. 8(b−c) show the open and 
closed views of the microgripper, respectively. 
Fig. 9 shows the force F to bending angle θb relations of 
Fingers 1 and 2; the SMA wire of each finger is given a 1/90 Hz 
triangular voltage input. The imprecision from image blur is 
roughly ±0.5°. The bending angle agrees well with the 
simulation results for small force. However, the difference 
increases with increasing force. The difference is due to the 
inaccurate machining; especially its in-plane thickness t is 
made slightly smaller than designed. As explained in Fig. 7, the 
sensitivity of t is large and increases with increasing force. In 
addition, the gap between heating and cooling paths is partially 
caused by friction. Friction affects heating more than cooling. 
Hence heating produces a slightly smaller bending angle for the 
same F. For Fingers 1 and 2, the maximal gaps are less than 
7.6% and 8.8% of the corresponding largest bending angles. 
The small gaps justify the assumption of negligible friction.  
When gripping an object, the SMA wire force is used both to 
deflect the finger and provide contact force for securing the 
object. For the same gripper, the amount of gripping force 
depends on the contraction force and the distance between 
gripper tip and object. The larger the distance, the larger the 
contraction force is required to produce the same gripping force. 
An experiment setup illustrated in Fig. 10 studies the effect of 
contraction force on gripping force. To measure the gripping 
force, another identical force sensor (emulate an external object) 
is placed with distance d next to the tip of one finger. When the 
wire is being heated, it first displaces the finger tip by distance 
d to contact the force sensor. The contraction force then 
experiences a sudden change of slope when the gripping force 
is been detected by the force sensor. By providing triangular 
voltage inputs, the contraction forces and corresponding 
gripping forces are recorded. Two distances d for Finger 2 are 
tested and results shown in Fig. 11. As expected, the gripping 
force increases with increasing F. Fig. 11 shows a linear curve 
fit of the gripping force versus F. Since the maximum allowable 
F is 3.82 N from Sec. 2, the achievable maximal gripping force 
is 0.49 N, which represents a mechanical advantage of 0.128.

hysteresis. Unlike hysteresis curves of SMA strain to 
temperature that display a large gap between heating and 
cooling, the gap of an F-R hysteresis curve is much smaller. For 
Fp = 0.06 N, the heating and cooling paths almost partially 
merge. With increasing wire pretension, we observe that the 
cooling path shifts to the left hand side of the heating path. This 
trend is consistent with that in [19], except that strain rather 
than force is sensed in [19]. The shift is explained by the effect 
of pretension on SMA microstructure (presence of R-phase) 
during cooling. Regardless the shift of the cooling path, the gap 
between heating and cooling in Fig. 13 remains small.  
For the same pretension, the F-R curve depends on input 
voltages of different amplitudes, frequencies, and waveforms. 
While the effects of frequencies and waveforms only slightly 
change the cooling path, different amplitudes change the size of 
the hysteresis curve. To study its effect, we test the hysteresis 
curves of another wire (Fp = 0.04 N) in Fig. 14. A sinusoidal 
voltage input with 1/90 Hz is given. The one with amplitude 2.7 
V is denoted as the major hysteresis curve. Two other minor 
curves in Fig. 14 are generated with amplitudes 2.6 V and 2.5 V. 
A smaller curve is seen to resemble, and roughly enclosed by, a 
larger curve. It is also observed that the major hysteresis curve 
remains stable and exhibits minimal drift for successive cycles. 
Taking advantages of (i) the resemblance of minor curves with 
the major curve and (ii) the stable closeness of the heating and 
cooling curves, an F-R model can be established to self-sense 
the force of microgrippers.  
Although the resistance increases and decreases during 
heating, the increase portion due to temperature rise (A to B in 
Fig. 14) only slightly changes the initial contraction force and 
can be ignored. Portion B to C (primarily due to transformation) 
maps the decrease of resistance to almost the entire range of the 
contraction force. Thus the F-R relation can be established in 
this portion. We adopt the polynomial model (see [28] for an 
example) to establish the F-R relation. The hysteresis curve is 
first divided into the heating and cooling curves. A normalized 
resistance λ is introduced between maximal resistance Rmax and 
minimal resistance Rmin. 
( - ) / ( - )min max minR R R R   (5)
In the rest of this section, we consider the hysteresis curve in 
Fig. 14, where Rmin = 16.176 Ω and Rmax = 17.335 Ω. For 
convenience, the polynomial fits start from F = 0.3 N to Fmax = 
2.062 N for both paths. The polynomial functions for the 
heating and cooling paths are expressed as follows. 
( )hF g  ; ( )cF g   (6)
Fig. 15 shows the sixth order polynomial fits together with the 
major hysteresis curve of Fig. 14. Explicit forms of the 
polynomials are given inside Fig. 15. Higher order polynomials 
can be used with limited accuracy improvement. The gap 
between the heating and cooling paths is computed by using 
(gh – gc)/Fmax 100%. Using this formula, the maximal gap is 
12.05% and it occurs at R = 17.11 Ω; there is a zero gap at the 
crossover R = 16.55 Ω. The percentage of the maximal gap is 
used to indicate the closeness of the heating and cooling paths. 
The smaller the maximal gap, the better the SMA resistance can 
serve to self-sense its contraction force. 
Since the heating and cooling curves are very close to each 
other, a simple yet practical means to reconstruct the F-R 
relation is to average the two paths. Thus the equation that 
relates a required resistance R (or λ) to a desired contraction 
force F is given as follows. 
F = ( )ag  = 0.5 [ ( ) ( )h cg g  ] (7)
The average path is also plotted in Fig. 15. Note that the F-R 
relation can be established by more sophisticated methods such 
as neural networks [19] or Preisach model [29]. Based on the 
F-R model in Fig. 15, we implement a PID controller with 
schematic in Fig. 16 to control the contraction force. A fuzzy 
logic operator is employed to schedule-tune the PID gains 
online. The determination of proper PID gains during transient

V. IMPLEMENTATION OF A SELF-POWERED GRIPPER MODULE 
Based on the design and control presented in the previous 
sections, we implement a self-powered gripper module shown 
in Fig. 20. The assembled gripper module weights 70 g with 
dimension 457020.5 mm3. The top layer stores the 
batteries to power the SMA wires and operational amplifiers. 
We use an off-the-shelf cell phone Lithium battery (3.6 V with 
1000 mAh) and two coin batteries (CR2032, 3 V). The bottom 
layer stores the printed circuit board and the gripper. The 
fingers are monolithically made with 90° apart. They are 
independently actuated by two SMA wires with Lex = 3 cm (δ = 
3% when F = 3.82 N). The fingers including the SMA wires 
only consist 1/5 of the space. The end of the module is attached 
with cables for input and output. Two reference voltage signals 
are input to actuate the two SMA wires. The outputs are the 
voltages VSMA and VR for each finger, which will be converted to 
the wire resistance by using (4). The overall system can 
continuously operate for more than three hours.    
Since the module is self-powered, it can be attached to 
various robot arms provided reference signal is given. A robot 
arm can move the gripper module to any position for 
manipulation, for example: minimally invasive surgery, micro 
assembly, and biological objects harvesting. To demonstrate 
the capability of the gripper module, we attach it on a small 
robot arm (adapted from Bioloid) in Fig. 21(a). The small robot 
arm can move the gripper module to any particular position for 
manipulation. Figs. 21(b)−21(c) show two such arm-gripper 
modules for coordinated manipulation of a string of 0.1 mm 
diameter and a screw with a nut. In Fig. 21(d), a different 
microgripper is fabricated with an extended front segment on 
each finger to handle much smaller objects. The finger with its 
front segment may be monolithically fabricated into various 
geometries depending on the tasks. Fig. 21(e) shows the gripper 
for harvesting flies. The self-sensing finger deflection control 
can prevent over-squeezing of delicate biological objects. Figs. 
22(a)−22(b) illustrate the gripper for picking up screws with 
diameters 1.7 mm and 4 mm. The gripper can pick up a 6 mm 
screw without noticeable out-of-plane deflection. This 
demonstrates the gripper for handling objects of various sizes 
and weights. Fig. 22(c) shows the gripper digging up another 
screw from a 1010 mm2 opening. Note that since the gripper 
is self-sensing, the battery and driving circuit in the module can 
be relocated to the fixed robot base such that the gripper module 
size can be further reduced. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a compliant 2-DOF microgripper 
actuated by distributed SMA wires. The gripper shape and 
SMA wire dimension are designed to achieve large gripping 
range and force in a limited space. The prototype gripper has 
arm length 10 mm, actuatable range 5.5 mm per arm, and 
sufficient out-of-plane stiffness. The demonstrated range to 
length ratio (55%) and gripping force (0.49 N) outperforms the 
existing microgrippers in Table 1. The proposed contraction 
force to SMA resistance model further provides self-sensing to 
control the gripper deflection. The integrated gripper module 
weighs no more than 70 g and can operate for more than three 
hours. A full grip-and-release takes approximately two seconds. 
The gripper can be conveniently attached to a robotic arm for 
manipulating tasks. Since our approach is rather generic, we 
expect it to be employed for the design of SMA wire actuated 
microgrippers of various sizes and configurations.

The purpose of this trip is to present a research paper in the 2010 IEEE International 
Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) held in Anchorage, Alaska, USA. 
The 2010 ICRA consists of numerous multidisciplinary technical conferences. More 
than 2062 papers were received but only 856 papers made to the final technical 
program. The acceptance rate is about 42%. There are also several keynote lectures, 
tutorials/workshops, and forums. This is a very big conference where you can meet 
scholars from different backgrounds. 
 
The title of my paper is “A Compliant Constant-Force Mechanism for Adaptive Robot 
End-Effector Operations”. This paper belonged to the “Compliance and Force 
Control” session on the second day (May 5, 2010) of the conference. The research 
focus of robot force control this year, from my observation of other presentations, was 
on the implementation of variable stiffness actuators for human-friendly interactions. 
I have also participated in several related sessions and found some of the topics 
interesting and inspiring. 
 
Finally, I would like to thank National Science Council of Taiwan for supporting my 
travel. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
目的與過程 
The purpose of this trip is to present a research paper in the 2010 International 
Conference on Robotics and Automation held in Anchorage, Alaska, USA. The title of 
my paper is “A Compliant Constant-Force Mechanism for Adaptive Robot 
End-Effector Operations”. The abstract of this paper is provided as follows. 
Force regulation is a challenging issue of robot end-effectors when interacting 
with unknown environments. It often requires sophisticated sensors with 
computerized control. This paper presents a constant-force mechanism (CFM) to 
regulate the contact force of a robot end-effector. The proposed CFM is a monolithic 
compliant mechanism that has no frictional wear and is capable of miniaturization. 
Due to the passive mechanism, additional sensors and control effort are minimized. 
We propose a design formulation to find the optimal CFM shape that produces the 
most constant force. The reaction force to input displacement curve is invariant of size 
and flexural rigidity. The curve can be manipulated depending on the desirable 
situations. The CFM is validated through an experiment. When equipped with the 
CFM, an illustrative end-effector can adapt to a surface of variable height, without 
additional motion programming. With the merits shown, we expect this type of elastic 
mechanism can be utilized in robot end-effectors to provide friendly contact with 
environment.  
This paper aims to develop a compliant CFM that is suitable for end-effector 
designs. I believe a practically useful design method should be simple and 
straightforward, at the same time the two major problems can be solved. My students 
and I are aiming at developing a design of this kind of actuator and we believe it can 
one day be a better design and even outperforms existing ones.  
I have also participated in several related sessions and found some of the topics 
interesting and inspiring. This is the second year that I attend this conference since I 
come back to Taiwan. This is a very good conference and I will continue to attend this 
conference if there are available travel grants.
