Abstract 
 
Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films have many excellent properties such as high hardness, 
low friction coefficient, chemical inertness, and biocompatibility. Their good 
biocompatibility is a result of their chemical composition containing only carbon and 
hydrogen which are biologically compatible. Previous studies on biocompatibility of 
DLC films focus primarily on morphological issues like roughness and wettability. 
However, we believe that the inclusion like nanocrystal or carbon nanotubes and the 
associated surface properties in the films are equally important. In exploring this effect, 
the multiwall carbon nanotubes were spin coated on silicon substrate and the deposited 
DLC with CH4 and Ar via PECVD. The film roughness was increased by larger CNTs 
contents. Different CNT contents DLC films were prepared by culturing the human 
endothelial cell ECV304 for 72 hours. The DLC films were examined by AFM, Raman 
spectroscopy, XPS, sessile drop and surfcorder to study the morphology, chemical 
bonding, wettability and residual stress. For DLC surface properties, as the CNT contents 
increases, the residual stress decreases and the sp3/sp2 ratio decrease. Meanwhile, the 
surface became more hydrophobic. The stress caused by different CNT contents seems to 
be correlated with the surface properties of DLC. As for the ECV304 cell culture, the 
viability for bare silicon without DLC is almost zero. This indicates that silicon is not 
biocompatible for ECV 304. The cell number of ECV in CNTs/DLC/Si is larger than that 
in CNTs/DLC in a 72-hour cell culture. This implies that a CNTs/DLC/Si whose surface 
properties are affected by CNTs is advantageous to ECV cell culture.  
bacteria attachment [23], hemocompatibility [24, 25], and dermal fibroblast adhesion 
[26]. 
In these works, the cellular response is influenced either by surface physics (surface 
roughness, wettability and surface energy) or by chemical bonding (doping and sp3/sp2 
ratio). Other factor such as residual stress might be as important. In this study, the effect 
of residual stress and the associated surface properties in biocompatibility are 
investigated by the cellular response of the human endothelial cell ECV304 in a 72-hour 
cell culture. The surface properties associated with the residual stress are reported to 
cross-examine their individual role in cellular viability. 
 
2. Experimental Procedure  
2.1 Diamond-like carbon film deposition 
The doping of nanocrystal or carbon nanotubes has been shown to affect the residual 
stress and mechanical properties [27, 28]. One-sided polished single crystalline silicon 
(100, CZ-grown p-type) was chosen as the substrate for DLC deposition. To fabricate a 
CNTs modified DLC film on silicon substrate, different contents (0.005 – 0.015 wt%) of 
multiwalled carbon nanotubes were spin coated on the silicon substrate, and then the 
DLC film was grown by r.f. plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with acetylene  
(C2H2) at base pressure 10-3 Torr and at substrate temperature 200 °C. The flow rate of 
acetylene is 20 sccm and the bias is at 300 V. The surface roughness of the film was 
measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instruments DI 500). The bonding 
structure of the DLC films was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw, wave length 
514.5 nm). The water contact angle was measured by AST VCA 2000 with distilled 
water, glycerol and diiodomethane with CCD to capture the contact angle. The idle time 
is 30 seconds for stabilization. The surface energy was calculated based on these 
measurements. The sp3 fraction and hydrogen content in the film was measured by X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Model ESCALAB 210) using A1 K monochromatic 
X-ray source. The residual stress is estimated by measuring the curvature of the 
film/substrate from a surfcorder (ET4000, Kosaka, Japan). The residual stress and the 
associated surface properties (surface roughness, contact angle, surface energy, ID/IG ratio, 
sp3/sp2 and hydrogen content) were examined to explore the role in biocompatibility in 
data can be used to calculate the solid surface free energy based on the following 
equation [30]:

where   is the contact angle, L , dL and PL are total surface free energy, dispersion 
component and polar component of the wetting liquid, respectively. For a solid surface, 
d
S  (dispersion component) and PS  (polar component) of the total free energy S can be 
solved from Eq (1) by two wetting reagents with given properties. The total solid surface 
free energy S is then the sum of these two components:

We use the contact angle of distilled water and glycerol to calculate the dispersive and 
polar components for DLC under different substrate surfaces. Fig. 6 illustrates the total 
surface free energy changes versus different CNT content DLC films. For higher 
CNTs/DLC film, rougher substrate surface (lower residual stress) has a larger contact 
angle and smaller surface free energy. Meanwhile, the free surface energy is dominated 
by the polar component. The hydrophobic surface nature and less surface free energy 
have been shown to affect the cellular response [19, 20].  
 
3.2 Film composition   
The film composition depends on the deposition process and its parameters, and the 
composition in the film might control cell adhesion and growth. The ID/IG ratio of DLC 
film was obtained by Raman spectra and the results are shown in Fig. 7. For higher CNTs 
contents DLC, the ID/IG ratio is higher which implies the degree of graphitization is 
higher for larger CNTs contents. Apart from the ID/IG ratio, other critical factors in 
biocompatibility are 23/spsp  and H content [22, 26]. Many methods determine the 
content of sp3/sp2 by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) [31], Auger 
electron spectroscopy (AES) [23] and spectroscopic ellipsometry and spectroscopic 
refractometry [32] and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [25]. We use XPS to 
determine the sp3 and sp2 fraction and estimate the total H content from 23/spsp  by the 
following equation [33, 34]: 
DLC, lower residual stress and higher ID/IG ratio seems to be preferable to cell culture. 
The results in the present work indicate that different CNT contents influences the surface 
properties of DLC and plays an important role in ECV 304 biocompatibility. The other 
indicator for biocompatibility is hydrogen content where hydrogen bonding is the 
mechanism for hydrophilicity [22]. For different DLC modified DLCs, the hydrogen 
content is inverse proportional to the CNTs content in DLC even though the variation is 
not significant. Little has been done to correlate film stress to biocompatibility. However, 
we found that lower residual stress is good for film adhesion, surface roughness and it is 
favorable for cell viability in particular. Based on these results, higher ID/IG ratio, lower 
surface free energy, slightly lower hydrogen content and small residual stress are 
advantageous for cell viability. All these results are consistent with previous studies. 
Wettability [19-21], roughness [21, 22], surface free energy [22] and hydrogen content 
[23-26] are common factors used to examine hemocompatibility in DLC. Here we 
demonstrate that the biocompatibility in CV 304 in DLC is also affected by different 
CNT contents. 
 
4. Conclusion  
Diamond-like carbon films modified by different CNT modified deposited on silicon 
substrate are used to examine the factors that affect biocompatibility. The films are 
characterized by surface roughness, contact angle, surface free energy, ID/IG, sp3/sp2, H 
content and residual stress. The roughness in the film is affected by hydrogen precursor 
plasma acting as an etching agent and CNT contents. The H content in different CNT 
contents varies depending on the amount of CNTs. The residual stress is reduced by 
higher CNT contents. The wettability, surface free energy, ID/IG, sp3/sp2 and residual 
stress are affected by the CNT contents. They play different roles in ECV 304 cell 
biocompatibility. Rough surface, hydrophobic, slightly lower surface free energy, low 
hydrogen content and small residual stress are good for cell viability.

Abstract 
Diamond like carbon (DLC) films is useful in many applications like optics, 
micro-electronics, tooling, the automobile industry. The drawbacks in DLC properties are 
its low toughness and high internal stress. To improve the tribological properties in DLC, 
we spin coat the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) (20-40 nm diameter, 5-15 m 
length, 95% purity) with 0.015%, 0.025% and 0.05%wt solution on (100) silicon. DLC 
was then deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with C2H2 
and H2. The surface and tribological properties of CNT doped DLC composite films were 
characterized by Raman spectroscopy and nanoscratch. The results show that the ID/IG 
ratio is increasing with higher CNT content. On the other hand, the friction coefficient 
and the critical load are decreasing with larger CNT doping. The decreasing friction 
coefficient is attributed to the graphitation on the surface due to the increasing sp2 content. 
The decreasing critical load is attributed to the high internal stress. The effect of friction 
coefficient and CNT concentration on stress distribution by a nanoscratch test are 
analyzed by a finite element method. The results indicate that low friction coefficient and

1. Introduction 
Diamond like carbon (DLC) film is characterized by low friction, high wear 
resistance, high hardness, chemical inertness and good biocompatibility. The property in 
DLC is determined by the hybrids of sp3 and sp2 bonding. Different deposition methods 
and operation parameters often results in different DLC property. Many DLC application 
in high wear resistance requires good adhesion and low friction coefficient. For example, 
wear protective coating in hard disk [1,2], tool steel [3,4] and orthopedic material [5,6]. 
Many factors affect the DLC coating performance such as hydrogen content [7], humidity 
[8] and metal doping [9,10]. The doping of DLC with different metals (Ti, Fe, Mo) leads 
to the changes in the mechanical properties (lower stress, improved adhesion) and 
tribological properties (lower friction coefficient). The effect of friction coefficient 
reduction depends on the doping material and the operation condition [10]. Other than 
metal, carbon nanotubes have shown to be effective to increase fracture toughness [11]. 
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have significant properties like high elastic modulus (1-1.8 
TPa), exceptional tensile strength and high fracture toughness. CNT has been used as 
reinforcement in various matrix like ceramics or polymer to enhance stiffness, strength, 
and toughness [12,13]. New strengthening mechanisms like CNT collapse and shear 
banding occur and increase the fracture toughness [14]. Only a few studies regarding 
CNT doping for hard film DLC. Kinoshita et al. [11] fabricated the vertical CNT doping 
DLC and found increased toughness and reduced hardness. The other doping method by 
electrodeposition is found to decrease the residual stress [15]. In these works, the role of 
CNT concentration and the effect on friction coefficient is not clear. Motivated by these 
 5
3. Finite Element Analysis in Nanoscratch 
Follow the approach of Tkaya et al. [16], a 2D scratch analysis was used to study the 
effect of friction coefficient and CNT concentration. A hard conical with an apical angle 
of 40◦ and a spherical tip with a radius R = 200 m  is used as a indenter. The domain is 
a 2D plane with a height h = 101 mm and a length L=100 mm. Fig. 1 shows half of the 
finite element mesh corresponding to the region. The displacement of the mesh in all 
directions was prevented in plane 02 x . 2D Elements with four node rectangles and 
reduced integration were used. Near the work zone, the mesh was refined (Fig. 1). The 
scratch test has two steps: an indentation step where the indenter was moved vertically 
( 2x ) with a depth d = 500 m , and a scratching step where the indenter is blocked in the 
normal direction and moved horizontally d = 15 mm with scratch speed 20 mm/s. The 
scratch test was quasi-static and the materials are homogeneous and isotropic for DLC 
and CNT. The constitutive law is elastoplastic for DLC and is elastic for CNT. The elastic 
behavior was modelled by a linear law with two constant parameters: Poisson’s ratio,  = 
0.25 and 2.0 for DLC and CNT, respectively; Young’s modulus, E= 120 GPa and 1000 
GPa for DLC and CNT, respectively. For DLC, the von Mises yield criterion was used 
with the initial flow stress 0 = 4610 MPa. After yielding, the power law hardening was 
employed and was expressed as follows: 
,nK   for EY /                                                  (1) 
where 120K GPa and 55.0n  for DLC. The effects of friction coefficient and CNT 
weight percentage were studied. The overall trend is used to compare with the 
experimental results. 
 
 7
the high stressing zone caused by the friction induced traction is similar, the unloading 
region varies for different friction coefficient. The comparison of the magnitude of the 
maximum von Mises stress caused by different friction coefficient is shown in Fig. 7. The 
increase of friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.08 caused large stress increment. When the 
friction coefficient exceeds 0.08, the effect of friction coefficient in stress increase is not 
significant. The linear correlation between friction coefficient and stress magnitude 
implies higher stress in induced during the scratch process for larger friction coefficient 
and this is adverse for adhesion. Larger friction coefficient means less adhesion strength. 
Another factor affecting the scratch process is the weight percentage in CNT. The effect 
of CNT content in stress distribution is shown in Fig. 8. The increasing of CNT weight 
percentage leads to reduction in stress magnitude. The mechanism for stress reduction in 
high density CNT is caused by the distribution and orientation of the CNT which can 
effectively resist the scratch load. The magnitude in stress reduction for different CNT 
content is shown in Fig. 9. The stress reduction is most effect when the weight percentage 
increase from 0.34% to 0.68%, after that the increase of CNT content does not further 
reduce the stress magnitude. From these results, lower friction coefficient and larger CNT 
content is favorable for stress reduction and is advantageous for adhesion. Our 
experiments results show higher CNT contents and lower friction coefficient results in 
lower critical load. The explanation for this discrepancy is the high internal stress 
occurred during deposition. Therefore, the reduction of high internal stress is important in 
increase of the critical load.

ARTICLES
A ﬁnite element study on the hardness of carbon nanotubes-doped
diamond-like carbon ﬁlm
Chehung Weia) and Jui-Feng Yang
Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei 104, Taiwan
(Received 5 May 2011; accepted 26 August 2011)
The hardness of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) ﬁlms is modeled
by a nanoindentation ﬁnite element analysis. A three-dimensional (3D) formation where CNTs
are modeled as transverse isotropy is compared with a two-dimensional (2D) analysis with isotropic
CNTs. The results showed that for small CNTs volume fraction, the overall hardness of CNTs/
DLC/Si composites is controlled by the elastic modulus along the indentation direction. For vertical
CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the hardness in 3D analysis is close to that in 2D analysis if the isotropic
elastic modulus is taken as the long-axis direction. However, for horizontal CNTs-doped DLC
ﬁlms, the hardness in 3D and in 2D is similar if the 2D isotropic elastic modulus is taken as the
short-axis direction of the 3D elastic modulus. As a result, for small CNTs volume fraction,
the hardness of CNTs/DLC/Si composites can be modeled by a 2D isotropic inclusion as long as
the elastic modulus is chosen properly. The hardness in CNTs/DLC/Si composites depends on the
orientation of CNTs and the volume fraction. The mechanisms in hardness enhancement for
different CNT orientations are explained by shear stress and the effective projected area. The issues
like interface strength and indentation size effect are also addressed in terms of CNT orientations.
I. INTRODUCTION
High hardness, low friction coefﬁcient, chemical in-
ertness, biocompatibility, and wear resistance are good
properties associated with diamond-like carbon (DLC)
ﬁlms. To further improve the properties, carbon nano-
tubes (CNTs) have been doped into DLC ﬁlms. The
elastic modulus of CNTs is at the order 1–3 TPa,1 which
is 1,000 times higher than high-strength steel alloys.2
They also exhibit superior electrical and thermal prop-
erties.3 Research on CNTs doping is popular in the ﬁeld
of polymer composites for its effectiveness in improv-
ing the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties,4
as well as in the ﬁeld of metal matrix composites.5,6 The
matrix can be either soft or ductile. For hard matrix like
ceramics, many new strengthening mechanisms such as
CNT collapse and shear banding occur.7 Recently, CNTs
have been included in DLC ﬁlms to increase toughness,8
reduce friction coefﬁcient,9 or lower residual stress.10
However, the discrepancy in hardness of CNTs/DLC
composites seems to depend on CNT orientations. For
vertically grown CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the overall
hardness is reduced compared to undoped ones,8 while
for horizontal dispersed CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the
overall hardness is increased.9 This phenomenon poses
the question of exactly how the hardness in CNTs-doped
DLC ﬁlms is affected by CNT orientation. In this work, we
address this question by carrying out a nanoindentation to
calculate the hardness of CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms on
silicon substrates via three-dimensional (3D) and two-
dimensional (2D) ﬁnite element analysis. The effects of
modulus anisotropy, CNT orientation, interface strength,
and indentation size effect (ISE) on hardness and associ-
ated mechanisms are questions to be addressed.
II. THE THEORY OF NANOINDENTATION
HARDNESS
Indentation has been an effective tool to measure the
hardness and elastic modulus of a material. The hardness
measurements of the Knoop, Vickers, and Rockwell tests
are derivations from indentation. Nanoindentation applies
similar principles except that the indentation depth is
measured in nanometers rather than in microns. Nano-
indentation relies on continuous measurements of in-
dentation depths with increased loading and elastic
unloading. Mechanical properties like hardness and
elastic modulus can be extracted from the measurements.
The theory of nanoindentation is based on the contact
depth, hc, which is a function of indentation depth, the
applied load, and the contact stiffness as follows11:
hc ¼ hmax  ePmaxS ; ð1Þ
where hmax is the maximum indentation depth, Pmax is the
maximum applied load, S is the contact stiffness, and e is

evenly distributed in the matrix, CNT distribution in our
modeling is along the interface. The content of CNTs is
based on the volume fraction in 3D and area fraction in 2D
of CNTs over DLC ﬁlms. Based on the experiments, the
volume (area) fraction of CNTs is less than 1%. As for the
effect of CNT orientation on hardness, two additional
orientations such as 45° and random orientation are used to
compare with those in vertical and horizontal orientations.
As for the material properties, the diamond tip is
modeled with E 5 1140 GPa and m 5 0.07. The
constitutive law is elastoplastic for DLC ﬁlms and is
elastic for CNTs. The elastic behavior in CNTs is modeled
by a linear law with ﬁve constants in the 3D case and with
two constants in the 2D case. Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio for DLC is E 5 120 GPa and m 5 0.25.
As for plastic behavior, the von Mises yield criterion is
used with the initial ﬂow stress r0 5 4610 MPa. After
yield, the power law hardening is used and expressed as
follows:
r ¼ Ken for e > Y=E ; ð4Þ
where K 5 120 GPa and n 5 0.55 for DLC. The elastic
constants of CNT used in the 3D and the 2D simulation are
summarized in Table I.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For transversely isotropic inclusions like CNTs, the
modeling is 3D in nature. However, a comparison with
the 2D isotropic counterpart demonstrates how the degree
of modulus anisotropy affects the overall hardness in
dilute CNTs/DLC/Si. Therefore, 3D simulations with
volume fraction 0.17% with transversely isotropic
CNTs/DLC are compared with the 2D modeling with
the same fraction and isotropic CNTs/DLC. The results
for overall hardness in vertical CNTs-doped DLC for 2D
isotropy with E 5 1 TPa, 3D transversely isotropic, and
2D isotropy with E 5 0.5 TPa are shown in Fig. 1.

respectively. For shear stress, there is a decline in shear
stress for all orientations after the indentation depth
exceeds 30% of the ﬁlm thickness with the biggest
decrease in horizontal direction [as shown in Fig. 7(c)].
Not only is the magnitude of the shear stress for horizontal
and random CNTs smaller, but the sign of the stress in
horizontal orientation changes from positive to negative.
Recently, we have shown that smaller positive shear
stress and larger negative shear stress lead to a higher
hardness.12 Therefore, the lower stress in horizontal and
random CNTs/DLC increases the hardness and this might
be the reason why the hardness in these orientations is
higher.
The other possible hardness enhancement mechanism
is the effective projected area of different CNT orienta-
tions. The idea of projected area is shown schematically
in Fig. 8 for vertical, 45°, and horizontal CNTs. For high
aspect ratio CNTs, the effective projected area of vertical
CNTs is very small compared to that of horizontal CNTs.
Even though horizontal CNTs (E 5 0.5 TPa) have lower
modulus along the indentation direction than horizontal
CNTs (E 5 1 TPa), the larger effective area in the former
will actually lead to higher hardness. This argument is
further veriﬁed by increasing the diameter of vertical
CNTs (d) or the length (L) of horizontal CNTs without
changing the modulus. For same volume fraction, vertical
CNTs with a larger diameter or horizontal CNTs with
longer length will increase the effective area in the single
CNT but decrease the total number of CNTs. Figure 9(a)
compares the hardness in vertical CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms
with varying diameters with the same length under the
same CNT concentration. For vertical orientation, a larger
diameter but with a smaller number of CNTs seems to be
more effective in hardness enhancement than those with
a smaller diameter but with more quantity. Similar results
are shown in Fig. 9(b) for horizontal CNTs with different
lengths but the same diameter. It is worth mentioning that
hardness difference due to dimensional change is not
proportional to diameter change or length change. There-
fore, it is not a pure geometrical effect. Other effects like
stress might be responsible for such nonlinearity. For
random orientation, the coupling and interaction effects
among each CNT might be the reason why random CNTs
have the best hardness enhancement among all orienta-
tions. For dilute CNT concentration, different stress
distribution and varying effective projected area under
different CNT orientations are the underlying mechanisms
for hardness enhancement.
There are certain issues that might affect the hardness
for CNTs/DLC. One is the interface strength between
CNTs and DLC ﬁlms. Even though DLC ﬁlms are
amorphous in nature, therefore the lattice misﬁt along
different CNT orientation might not occur; it is still
important to probe the role of interface strength in overall
hardness. We model the interface between CNTs and

A ﬁnite element study on the hardness of carbon nanotubes-doped
diamond-like carbon ﬁlm

The hardness of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) ﬁlms is modeled
by a nanoindentation ﬁnite element analysis. A three-dimensional (3D) formation where CNTs
are modeled as transverse isotropy is compared with a two-dimensional (2D) analysis with isotropic
CNTs. The results showed that for small CNTs volume fraction, the overall hardness of CNTs/
DLC/Si composites is controlled by the elastic modulus along the indentation direction. For vertical
CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the hardness in 3D analysis is close to that in 2D analysis if the isotropic
elastic modulus is taken as the long-axis direction. However, for horizontal CNTs-doped DLC
ﬁlms, the hardness in 3D and in 2D is similar if the 2D isotropic elastic modulus is taken as the
short-axis direction of the 3D elastic modulus. As a result, for small CNTs volume fraction,
the hardness of CNTs/DLC/Si composites can be modeled by a 2D isotropic inclusion as long as
the elastic modulus is chosen properly. The hardness in CNTs/DLC/Si composites depends on the
orientation of CNTs and the volume fraction. The mechanisms in hardness enhancement for
different CNT orientations are explained by shear stress and the effective projected area. The issues
like interface strength and indentation size effect are also addressed in terms of CNT orientations.
I. INTRODUCTION
High hardness, low friction coefﬁcient, chemical in-
ertness, biocompatibility, and wear resistance are good
properties associated with diamond-like carbon (DLC)
ﬁlms. To further improve the properties, carbon nano-
tubes (CNTs) have been doped into DLC ﬁlms. The
elastic modulus of CNTs is at the order 1–3 TPa,1 which
is 1,000 times higher than high-strength steel alloys.2
They also exhibit superior electrical and thermal prop-
erties.3 Research on CNTs doping is popular in the ﬁeld
of polymer composites for its effectiveness in improv-
ing the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties,4
as well as in the ﬁeld of metal matrix composites.5,6 The
matrix can be either soft or ductile. For hard matrix like
ceramics, many new strengthening mechanisms such as
CNT collapse and shear banding occur.7 Recently, CNTs
have been included in DLC ﬁlms to increase toughness,8
reduce friction coefﬁcient,9 or lower residual stress.10
However, the discrepancy in hardness of CNTs/DLC
composites seems to depend on CNT orientations. For
vertically grown CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the overall
hardness is reduced compared to undoped ones,8 while
for horizontal dispersed CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms, the
overall hardness is increased.9 This phenomenon poses
the question of exactly how the hardness in CNTs-doped
DLC ﬁlms is affected by CNT orientation. In this work, we
address this question by carrying out a nanoindentation to
calculate the hardness of CNTs-doped DLC ﬁlms on
silicon substrates via three-dimensional (3D) and two-
dimensional (2D) ﬁnite element analysis. The effects of
modulus anisotropy, CNT orientation, interface strength,
and indentation size effect (ISE) on hardness and associ-
ated mechanisms are questions to be addressed.
II. THE THEORY OF NANOINDENTATION
HARDNESS
Indentation has been an effective tool to measure the
hardness and elastic modulus of a material. The hardness
measurements of the Knoop, Vickers, and Rockwell tests
are derivations from indentation. Nanoindentation applies
similar principles except that the indentation depth is
measured in nanometers rather than in microns. Nano-
indentation relies on continuous measurements of in-
dentation depths with increased loading and elastic
unloading. Mechanical properties like hardness and
elastic modulus can be extracted from the measurements.
The theory of nanoindentation is based on the contact
depth, hc, which is a function of indentation depth, the
applied load, and the contact stiffness as follows11:
hc ¼ hmax  ePmaxS ; ð1Þ
where hmax is the maximum indentation depth, Pmax is the
maximum applied load, S is the contact stiffness, and e is

evenly distributed in the matrix, CNT distribution in our
modeling is along the interface. The content of CNTs is
based on the volume fraction in 3D and area fraction in 2D
of CNTs over DLC ﬁlms. Based on the experiments, the
volume (area) fraction of CNTs is less than 1%. As for the
effect of CNT orientation on hardness, two additional
orientations such as 45° and random orientation are used to
compare with those in vertical and horizontal orientations.

modeled with E 5 1140 GPa and m 5 0.07. The
constitutive law is elastoplastic for DLC ﬁlms and is
elastic for CNTs. The elastic behavior in CNTs is modeled
by a linear law with ﬁve constants in the 3D case and with
two constants in the 2D case. Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio for DLC is E 5 120 GPa and m 5 0.25.

used with the initial ﬂow stress r0 5 4610 MPa. After
yield, the power law hardening is used and expressed as
