achieve smoothness of the control signals, and hence
chattering reduction and accuracy control are decou-
pled together. Another advantage of DSMC is that it
is immune to the measurement noise since the low-pass
filter in Figure 1 can effectively filter out the noise con-
tained in the signal w.
Despite its superiority to the BLC, the design of
DSMC is challenging for the following reason. In the
DSMC design, the sliding variable is different from that
in the BLC design since the augmented system in Fig-
ure 1 is one dimensional larger than the original system.
As a result of this, the resultant new sliding variable in
DSMC contains an uncertainty term due to the exter-
nal disturbance and/or parametric uncertainty. Eval-
uation of the new sliding variable in DSMC becomes
difficult. To overcome the problem of sliding variable
estimation in DSMC, this project proposes using a two-
dimensional LTR observer (Doyle and Stein, 1979) for
estimation of the potentially unbounded sliding vari-
able in DSMC. The LTR observer, which was origi-
nally proposed for gain and phase margins recovery for
observer-based LQ control, finds new applications in
this project in the estimation of state-dependent un-
certainties in a dynamic system. Rigorous analysis will
be given for the estimation results of the LTR observer
as well as for the stabilizing property of the proposed
DSMC. The method proposed in this project is bet-
ter than existing methods since it does not need the
bounded trajectory assumption (Bartolini, 1989), nor
the differential inequality condition (Bartolini and Py-
dynowski, 1996), nor the detection of the change of sign
of the derivative of an accessible signal (Bartolini et al.,
1998).
2. Boundary Layer Control
Consider the sliding mode control design for
a linear system with uncertainty :
x˙ = Ax+B(u+ e), e = ∆ax+ d (1)
y = Cx
where x ∈ Rn is the system state, u ∈ R1 is the scalar
control input, and e = ∆ax+d is system uncertainty, in
which d is an unknown disturbance satisfying |d| ≤ d¯,
|d˙| ≤ d¯1, and ∆a ∈ R1×n contains uncertain parame-
ters with known upper bounds: ‖∆a‖ ≤ a¯. The system
state x is accessible for measurement. (A,B) is con-
trollable, and (A,C) observable. Furthermore, the row
vector C ∈ R1×n is chosen such that all zeros of the
system (A,B,C) are in the open left-half plane; i.e.,
the system (1) has a stable zero dynamics. The pur-
pose of this section is to review a boundary layer slid-
ing mode control that achieves practical stability in the
sense that given any initial condition, the control can
drive the system state to approach any pre-specified
small neighborhood of the origin asymptotically.
To facilitate the stability analysis of sliding mode
control, introduce a state transformation,
x = T
[
z
η
]
(2)
where T ∈ Rn×n is an invertible transformation ma-
trix, and the first group of new state z ∈ Rr is called
the external state (Marquez, 2003), consisting of output
derivatives,
z =


z2

y˙
...
y(r−1)
 =

Cx
CAx
...
CAr−1x
 (3)
where r is the relative degree of the system (1). The
second group of new state η ∈ Rn−r is the internal
state or zero dynamic state (Marquez, 2003) satisfying
η˙ = Qη + Pz, (4)
for some matrices Q, P , where Q is a square matrix
whose eigenvalues are open-loop zeros of the system
(1) (Isidori, 1989). From the stable zero assumption,
Q is known to be stable.
To design a boundary layer sliding mode control,
one first chooses a sliding variable
s1 = y(r−1) + λr−2y(r−2) + · · ·+ λ1y˙ + λ0y
= (CAr−1 + λr−2CAr−2 + · · ·+ λ0C)x, (5)
where r is the system relative degree, and the coef-
ficients λi’s are chosen such that the sliding surface
s1 = 0 defines a stable ODE of y.
Then, choose the control input u to drive the slid-
ing variable s1 in (5) to almost zero:
u = φ+ v, (6)
where φ is a nominal control for the case when there is
no system uncertainty,
φ =
1
CAr−1B
(−CArx− λr−2CAr−1x− · · ·
− λ1CA2x− λ0CA1x− σs1), σ > 0 (7)
and v is a boundary layer control (Slotine and Li, 1991)
to suppress the adverse effects of system uncertainties,
v = − e¯(x)
CAr−1B
sat(

where the output injection gain L2 is given by
(I +A2)Q+Q(A2 + I)T − 1
µ
QCT2 C2Q
+piB2BT2 = 0, L2 =
1
µ
QCT2 , (15)
where pi is sufficiently large, and µ > 0.
Lemma 2 (Doyle and Stein, 1979) : Since (A2 +
I,B2, C2) is minimum-phase, the solution Q of the ob-
server Riccati equation (15) satisfies limpi→∞ Qpi = 0.
Based on Lemma 2, one can now show that the
proposed LTR observer achieves small estimation er-
rors of q by using a sufficiently large design parameter
pi in the observer Riccati equation (15).
Theorem 3 : The LTR observer (14) and (15) achieves
a small estimation error q˜ = q − qˆ in the sense that
lim
t→∞ ‖q˜(t)‖ ≤ 1‖x‖+ 2|u|+ 3, (16)
where limpi→∞ i = 0 for all i = 1, 2, 3.
Since y˜(r) is the second component of q˜, it satisfies
|y˜(r)| ≤ ‖q˜‖. Hence, it follows from Theorem 3 that
lim
t→∞ |y˜
(r)(t)| ≤ 1‖x‖+ 2|u|+ 3, (17)
with limpi→∞ i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3.
In other words, the estimate yˆ(r) of y(r) obtained
from the proposed LTR observer (14) achieves a small
estimation error, whose magnitude can be controlled by
the design parameter pi in the observer Riccati equa-
tion (15). Following the notations used in the study of
adaptive system analysis, Equation (17) can be written
as y˜(r)(t) = o(‖x‖) + o(|u|) + o(1).
Recall from (9) that for the dynamic sliding mode
control, the new sliding variable s2 is
s2 = y(r) + λr−1y(r−1) + · · ·+ λ1y˙ + λ0y, (18)
where the first term y(r) can now be approximately
estimated by the robust LTR observer (14). Hence, an
estimate of s2 is obtained as
sˆ2 = yˆ(r) + λr−1y(r−1) + · · ·+ λ1y˙ + λ0y, (19)
= yˆ(r) + λr−1CAr−1x+ · · ·+ λ1CAx+ λ0Cx
with yˆ(r) the second element of qˆ in the LTR observer
(14).
In the above paragraph, one has introduced
the design of sliding variable s2 in dynamic sliding
mode control, and presented a solution to its evalu-
ation problem via the LTR observer. Having obtained
an estimate sˆ2 in (19) for the sliding variable s2, one
can now present the control design for the control vari-
able w = u˙ in Figure 1, which aims to drive s2 to almost
zero,
u˙ = w = φ(sˆ2) + v(sˆ2), (20)
where φ(sˆ2) is a nominal control for the situation when
there is no system uncertainty,
φ(sˆ2) =
1
CAr−1B
{−CAr+1x− CArBu−
λr−1yˆ(r) − · · · − λ0CAx− σsˆ2} (21)
and v(sˆ2) a switching control to suppress the adverse
effects of system uncertainty,
v(sˆ2) = − δ(x, u)
CAr−1B
sgn(sˆ2),
δ(x, u) = ρ1‖x‖+ ρ2|u|+ ρ3, ρi > 0 (22)
in which ρi’s are chosen large enough so that δ(x, u) is
an upper bound of |∆p| in (13); that is, δ(x, u) > |∆p|.
From (20), the true control input to the system is
given by
u = H(s)(φ+ v), H(s) =
1
s
(23)
Even though the switching control v in (22) contains
high-frequency chattering, this high-frequency chatter-
ing will be filtered out by the low-pass filter H(s). The
control input u to the real system then becomes chat-
tering free.
The stabilizing property of the proposed control
(23) is proved by the theorem below.
Theorem 4 : The proposed dynamic sliding mode
control (23) practically stabilizes the system (1) with
bounded control u, in the sense that the system state
is asymptotically driven into a residual set around the
origin, with the size of residual set approaching zero
as the design parameter pi in observer Riccati equation
(15) approaches infinity.
Remark 2 : Notice that for the dynamic sliding mode
control in Theorem 4, the steady state error is con-
trolled by the LTR observer parameter pi in (15), while
the chattering reduction of the control signal u is, as
explained before the Theorem, achieved by filtering.
Hence, the mechanism of chattering reduction and that
of accuracy control are decoupled in the dynamic slid-
ing mode control design.
