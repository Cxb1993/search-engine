temporal dynamics.  This is particularly difficult when one 
attempts to synthesize moving sources with smooth sound 
impression.  Second, using HRTFs to synthesize multiple 
sound sources can be computationally prohibitive, given the fact 
that a HRIR is generally of several hundred coefficients.  
These limitations have prompted the development of functional 
representations of HRTFs.  It is desirable to develop efficient 
means in synthesizing HRTFs for real-time applications.  
Perhaps Batteau’s work represents the first functional approach 
of modeling HRTFs.  He suggested that the external ear could 
be modeled as a three-channel, two-delay and sum, acoustic 
coupler.  Another effort is that of Genuit(1986) who adopted a 
filter-bank of 16 time-delay channels to represent the combined 
effects due to the external ears, pinnae, head, shoulders, and 
torso.  Duda(2000) also proposed structural models for HRTFs 
on the basis of the spherical-head model and a monaural pinna 
model.  Chen derived a beamformer model for the external 
ears from measured HRTFs.(Chen et al.,1992)  Alternatively, 
low-dimension and orthogonal representation for measured 
HRTFs have been developed(Chen et al.,1995; Kistler et 
al.,1992; Middlebrooks et al.,1992) by applying the principal 
component analysis (PCA) to the logarithms of the HRTFs’ 
magnitudes after the direction-independent, frequency 
dependency is removed. 
In this paper, an order-reduced model, the HRTF 
Interpolation and Reduced Order Model (HIROM), is suggested 
for HRTFs approximation.  In comparison with Chen’s 
model(Chen et al.,1995), the present method is based on 
acoustic principles and a simpler decomposition.  The HRTF 
database measured by the MIT Media Laboratory(Gardner et 
al.,1994) is used for the verification of this method.  The data 
consist of the left and right ear impulse responses from a 
Realistic Optimus Pro 7 loudspeaker, mounted 1.4 meters from 
Knowles Electronics Manikin for Acoustic Research (KEMAR) 
dummy head.  Specifically, 710 different positions were 
measured at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.   
Performance analysis of the algorithm will be presented 
in terms of the computational efficiency and storage 
requirement.  Listening tests for sound localizations will be 
carried out and the results will be discussed.

HRIR BASED ON INTERPOLATION AND 
REDUCED ORDER MODEL (HIROM) 
In this section, a brief review of HRTF problem is given, 
followed by the formulation of the algorithm, HIROM. 
A. Reduced Order Model of HRIR 
In essence, HRTFs can be associated with the scattering 
pattern around the head, generated by incident plane waves.  
By acoustic reciprocity (Kinsler et al.,1980),this problem is 
equivalent to the free-field radiation pattern produced by a point 
source located at the ear position.  The development of 
HIROM was motivated by the solution of wave equation in the 
spherical coordinate system.  In a 3D exterior domain, the 
sound pressure function p at an arbitrary position ( )φθ ,,r  of 
an exterior domain can be expressed as the following 
expansion(Williams,1999):

B. Interpolation of HRIR 
In practice, interpolation may be required to achieve finer 
resolution than the given finite number of discrete data points.  
This is especially the case when smoothness in synthesizing 
moving source is important.  Hence, the discrete 
direction-dependent vector ( ),m p pθ φu  in Eq. (5) is further 
interpolated into continuous functions of θ  and φ .  This 
method is less computationally intensive than direct 
interpolation on the original matrix H in that the length of 
( ),m p pθ φu  is generally shorter than that of ( ),p pθ φh . 
One way of interpolation is the bilinear method(Savioja 
et al.,1999; Freeland et al.,2002) that computes the HRTF 
corresponding to a given point on a reference sphere as a 
weighted mean of the measured HRTFs associated with the four 
nearest points surrounding the point to be interpolated.  
Referring to Figure 2, an alternative method is devised in this 
paper for interpolating the discrete vector ( )ppm φθ ,uˆ  into a 
continuous function ),( φθmu  by using the following 
formula: 
( ) ( )∑=
p
ppmpm uwu φθφθ ,ˆ,             (6) 
where the weighting function at the pth direction

= ∑  
with the distance pd  defined as 
( ) ( )2 2p p pd θ θ φ φ= − + −              (7) 
When the desired position falls on the grid line between 
two measured points, only these two elements of ( )ˆ ,m p pθ φu  
connecting the grid line were used to calculate ),( φθmu  (p = 
1, 2).  In the limit when one of the distances tends to zero, the 
desired position coincides with the measured point with unity 
weight.  Although more elaborate methods can be used for 
interpolation, the present method seem to be acceptable for our 
purpose.  Thus, HRIRs at any locations ( )φθ ,  can be 
synthesized as

It should be aware that ),( φθmu  is a continuous-space

vector.  Equation (8) is referred to as the HRIR based on 
Interpolation and Reduced Order Model (HIROM).

IMPLEMENTATION OF HIROM 
ALGORITHM 
A virtual acoustical image can be created by direct 
convolution of the input program signal with the appropriate 
HRTF at that specified source direction.(Cheng et al.,1999)  
The resulting signals are presented at the listener’s left and right 
ears over headphones, as shown in Figure 3 (a).  The direction 
),( φθ  determines which pair of HRTFs to use.  The FIR 
filter representing the HRTF usually has more than 100 taps at a 
typical audio sampling rates, 44.1 kHz.  Figure 3 (b) 
demonstrates an architecture that positions multiple sound 
sources in different directions.  Sound source signals 
1, , Ks s"  are filtered by the corresponding HRTF pair, and 
then summed up separately at the left and right channels.  This 
direct approach is computationally intensive due to the required 
large number of filtering operations.

Comparison of Eqs. (12) and (13) reveals that doubling the 
number of sources does not double the number of convolutions.  
It only results in M extra multiplications and M-1 additions.  
Since convolution involves N multiplications and N-1 additions 
per sample, if M << N, the saving of operations can be 
remarkable.  We can apply the same principle to arbitrarily K 
sources.  Generalization of the reasoning to the case with K 
independent sources is straightforward

The output signal is the sum of each spatially weighted 
source convolved with the respective HRIR.  The inner 
summation requires MK multiplications and M(K-1) additions 
for M modes and K sources.  A typical digital signal processor 
(DSP) would take MK instructions to perform the inner 
summation.  For a N-tapped ( )mv n , the outer summation 
and the convolution would take M(N+1) instructions to 
complete.  The total number of instructions needed is 
M(N+1)+MK = M(N+K+1), as compared to the KN instructions 
required by the direct convolution.  The computational 
efficiency of the proposed method versus the direct approach 
can be quantitatively assessed, with the aid of the following 
performance index 
 ( )1++= KNM
KN
cη .               (15) 
Note that MN→η  as ∞→K .  Clearly, Eq. (14) 
requires only M convolutions irrespective of how many sources 
are present.  Each source requires M multiplications and M-1 
additions.  It follows that Eq. (14) is more efficient than the 
direct convolution when K M> .  The saving can be 
substantial when K is significantly larger than M. 
Interpolation may be needed if the desired locations do 
not coincide with the measured grid points of the HRTF 
database.  Assume that the interpolation takes Q instructions 
for each point (Q = 2 for linear interpolation ).  According to 
Eq. (8), the interpolation of HIROM is performed on 
( ),mu θ φ , which takes MQ instructions.  By contrast, the 
interpolation performed on the original HRIR database would 
take NQ instruction.  Thus the index of computational 
efficiency cη  is further improved

Figures 5 and 6 plot cη  against K, with M as the parameter for 
different filter length N.  Equations (15) and (16) correspond to 
the lower bound (solid line) and the upper  bound (dash line), 
respectively.  Linear interpolation is assumed (Q = 2).  In 
practice, not all positions need interpolation, the predicted 
efficiency will fall somewhere between Eqs. (15) and (16).  
However, these results show the general trend of the 
computational benefit obtained using HIROM for large number 
of sources. 
D. Storage Requirement 
Assume that a measured HRIR database requires a 
memory space to store a total of PN taps of all HRIRs with P 
and N representing, respectively, the number of positions and 
the length of each filter.  By contrast, we need to store only the 
matrices U, Σ , and V for HIROM.  Furthermore, only the M 
diagonal elements of Σ  need to be stored.  Thus HIROM 
would take up (PM+M+NM) memory spaces, as compared to 
PN for the direct approach.  The storage requirement can be 
assessed by defining the following ratio 
( )1++= PNM
PN
sη                  (17) 
where in general P and N are large and M is small. 
If I points are needed for interpolation, the storage 
requirement can be reduced by a factor I1 : 
( )1++= PNM
PNI
sη .               (18) 
Figure 7 plots sη  as a function of P without 
interpolation.  For large N and small M, the 
improvement on the storage requirement, as indicated 
by sη , can be quite large.  For example, the

SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF HIROM 
ALGORITHM 
   A subjective experiment was carried out to evaluate the 
adequacy of HIROM.  The assessment criterion lies in the 
ability of localizing virtual sources using headphones.  The test 
stimuli were generated, by using three different methods: (1) the 
measured HRTFs from MIT database, (2) a 15th-order HIROM, 
and (3) a 8th-order HIROM.  The HRTFs of the horizontal 
plane measured by MIT and the reconstructed result using the 
8th-order HIROM are compared in Figure 8.

(b) 
Figure 5.  The HRTFs on the horizontal plane.  (a) 
Measured, (b) reconstructed with an 8th-order 
HIROM. 
An 8th-order HIROM suffices to represent the gross 
characteristics of the HRTFs, whereas the 15th-order HIROM is 
able to capture more details.  A random noise band limited to 
20 kHz and a female speech signal were used as the input 
signals to these filters.  Ten human subjects with normal 
hearing participated in the experiments. 
Both azimuths and elevations were investigated in the 
experiments.  Both the random noise and the speech signal 
were used in the azimuth test, whereas only the former was used 
in the elevation test due to the fact that the energy of the speech 
signal concentrates below 5 kHz with little elevation cues in the 
band.  Twelve directions, starting at 0∘with a 30∘interval on 
the horizontal plane were examined in the azimuth test.  Five 
directions from -30∘to 90∘with a 30∘interval were simulated 
for the elevation test.  The geometrical arrangement of the 
virtual sound sources for the experiments is shown in Figure 9. 
 10
Figure 11 shows the results of the azimuth test for the 
speech signal.  Similar to Figure 10, front-back reversals 
increase when the order of HIROM is reduced to 8.  The 
accuracy of localization is not as good as the result of the 
random noise because the energy of the speech signal 
concentrates only at low frequency range.

decreasing order of HIROM.  These experiments indicate that 
the HIROM of order 15 produces quite accurate approximation
