Abstract 
 
  The aim of this research project is to develop 
a robust real-time visual-servo system using the 
low cost and off the shelf software and 
hardware. Moreover, a vision-based rotational 
inverted pendulum apparatus is used to 
evaluate the performance of the developed 
visual-servo system. To enhance the real-time 
performance of image processing, the FPGA 
device is used to provide high computational 
power and high data bandwidth. Moreover, less 
computationally demanding algorithms are 
adopted to meet the real-time requirement. 
However, it will result in less precise 
measurement of the object’s position. Such 
measurement inaccuracy, quantization error, 
and variance in illumination are regarded as 
white noise. The mixed 2 /H H¥  controller is 
then designed to stabilize the system, achieve 
noise attenuation and improve robustness of the 
system. The resulting controller is implemented 
on a digital signal processor. Finally, 
experimental results are given to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the developed visual-servo 
system. 
 
Keywords: Hand-eye coordination; Mixed 
2 /H H¥  control; Visual-servo control. 
 
1.  Motivation and Objective 
 
  Hand-eye coordination is a dexterity ability 
of the advanced creatures. To imitate the action 
of the human being in the humanoid robotic 
systems, the development of the hand-eye 
coordination ability is an important task. The 
visual-servo techniques are always exploited 
for achieving this goal. Shirai and Inoue [1] 
used the vision feedback control for the robotic 
positioning. This is the first appearance of 
vision servo, and the first time to apply the 
image information to control the end-effector. 
But due to limitation of the hardware, the real- 
time performance of systems is limited. 
Today’s advances in development of the 
integrated circuits have facilitated the vision-

Actually, the edge detection is the spatial 
filtering of an image, and it uses a mask to 
process all pixels of the image. The spatial 
filtering is illustrated in Fig. 2. The method of 
this process is to move the filtering mask from 
one pixel to another, and the response of the 
filter at every pixel ( , )x y  is obtained by the 
sum of the filter parameters times the 
corresponding the gray level of the pixels 
where the filter mask covers. For instance, the 
filter response R of a 3 3´  mask at the pixel 
( , )x y  of the image shown in the Fig. 2 is 
given by

and K is the controller. The aim of the 
controller design is to design a feedback 
controller u Ky=  such that the closed-loop 
system is asymptotically stable. Moreover, the 
closed-loop system satisfies the following 
design specifications: 
1. The H¥ -norm of the closed-loop transfer 
function wzT ¥  from w to z¥  must less 
than 1g  to guarantee robust stability, i.e. 
1wzT g¥ ¥ < ; 
2. The 2H -norm of the closed-loop transfer 
function 
2wz
T  from w to 2z  is minimized 
to achieve the optimal 2H -performance.

7.  Conclusion 
 
  In this research study, we have developed a 
framework for robust visual-servo-based 
control systems. In general, the image 
processing algorithms are often 
computationally demanding. It is an obstacle to 
the real-time applications in this study. To 
overcome this difficulty, the FPGA was used to 
provide high computational power and high 
data bandwidth. Moreover, less 
computationally demanding algorithms were 
adopted to meet the real-time requirement. It 
resulted in less precise measurement. Such 
measurement inaccuracy was regarded as white 
noise. The mixed 2 /H H¥  controller was then 
designed to stabilize the system and achieve the 
noise attenuation. Finally, the experimental 
results were presented to show effectiveness of 
the developed system. 
 
8.  Self-evaluation of significance 
 
In conventional inverted pendulum systems, 
position feedback of the pendulum is obtained 
by the optical encoder. In this research study, 
an inverted pendulum system is stabilized by 
the visual feedback using a CMOS image 
sensor instead of the optical encoder. The 
results show that the performance of visual 
feedback is as good as the encoder feedback. 
Significance of the results of this research is to 
use the hardware to enhance the real-time 
performance of image processing and utilize 
the modern control theorem to improve the 
performance and robustness of the visual-servo 
system. The results of this research were 
submitted to the 2008 IFAC and received the 
Excellence Award of 2006 TI Taiwan DSP 
Application Design Competition.
