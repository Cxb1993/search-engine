1 Preface
By assuming that the stock price follows the lognormal diﬀusion, Black and Scholes (1973)
arrive at their ground-breaking option pricing model for non-dividend-paying stocks. Merton
(1973) extends the model to the case where the underlying stock pays a non-stochastic
continuous dividend yield. In reality, however, almost all stock dividends are paid discretely
rather than continuously. For simplicity, this dividend setting is called the discrete dividend
setting if the amounts of future dividends are known today. Pricing options on a stock
that pays discrete dividends seems to be investigated ﬁrst in Black (1975). The discrete-
dividend option pricing problem has drawn a lot of attention in the literature. Frishling
(2002) summarizes that there are three diﬀerent ways to model the stock price process with
discrete dividends. But only one model that assumes the stock price jumps down with
the amount of dividend paid at the exdividend date can produce reasonable option prices.
However, it is hard to derive analytical pricing formulas for this model and some numerical
methods like lattices are ineﬃcient when used to implement it. My project will provide a
novel tree model for solving this problem.
2 The Goal of This Research Project
My research project intends to construct a new lattice, the stair lattice, that simulate the
stock price process with discrete dividends. It can successfully model the jumping of stock
price at the exdividend date. It is also guaranteed to converge to the price process of the stock
that pays multiple discrete dividends. And the stair lattice is proved to be constructable
and eﬃcient. Besides, the stair lattice can be extended so a future dividend paid at time
t depends on the stock prices and the dividends prior to time t in arbitrary ways. This
extension makes the stair lattice more realistic and ﬂexible.
3 Literature Review
Frishling (2002) summarizes that there are three diﬀerent ways to model the stock price
process with discrete dividends. These three diﬀerent models are introduced as follows:
Model 1. Roll (1977) suggests that the stock price is divided into two parts: the stock
price minus the present value of future dividends over the life of the option and the present
value of future dividends. The former part (call it net-of-dividend stock price) is assumed
to follow a lognormal diﬀusion process, whereas the latter part is assumed to grow at the
risk-free rate. Thus vanilla options can be computed by applying the Black-Scholes formula
with the stock price replaced by the net-of-dividend stock price. Cox and Rubinstein (1985)
also call this model the ad hoc adjustment.
Model 2. Musiela and Rutkowski (1997), following Heath and Jarrow (1988), suggests
that the cum-dividend stock price, deﬁned as the stock price plus the forward values of
the dividends paid from today up to maturity, follows a lognormal diﬀusion process. Thus
vanilla options can be computed by the Black-Scholes formula by replacing the stock price
with the cum-dividend stock price and by adding the forward values of the dividends prior
to maturity to the strike price.

The initial stock price is S. The upward and downward multiplicative factors for the stock

and pd, respectively.
not be easily extended for pricing American options.
Model 3 can also be implemented by the lattice or the related PDE method. But a
naive application of these methods results in combinatorial explosion. Take the well-known
Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial lattice as an example. Assume that the lattice starts
at time step 0 and ends at time step n. Let R stand for the gross risk-free return per time
step. When the stock does not pay dividends, in one time step the price S becomes Su (the
up move) with probability pu and Sd (the down move) with probability pd ≡ 1− pu, where
pu ≡ (R − d)/(u − d). The relation ud = 1 is enforced by the CRR binomial lattice. A
simple 3-time-step binomial lattice is illustrated in Fig. 1. The binomial lattice recombines;
thus the size of the lattice is only quadratic in n. Unfortunately, the recombination property
disappears if the stock pays discrete dividends. Consider the 4-time-step binomial lattice
with an ex-dividend date at time step 2 in Fig. 2. This lattice splits into 3 lattices after
the ex-dividend date. Each such lattice will be split further into more separate lattices for
each subsequent ex-dividend date. As a result, the lattice size grows exponentially with the
number of exdividend dates. It will be referred to as the bushy lattice. The bushy lattice
implements the Model 3, but the exponential complexity renders it impractical.
In additional to the ﬁrst two models mentioned in Frishling (2002), eﬃcient numerical
algorithms and simple formulas can also result by approximating the discrete dividend with
either (1) a ﬁxed dividend yield on each dividend-paying date or (2) a ﬁxed continuous
dividend yield. The ﬁrst approach is followed by Geske and Shastri (1985). They replace
the discrete dividends with ﬁxed dividend yields. The resulting lattice hence recombines and
lattice model, it is assumed that there are n equal time steps between year 0 and year T .
The length of each time step ∆t is equal to T/n. Thus, time step i in the discrete-time
model corresponds to year i∆t in the continuous-time model. The upward and downward
multiplicative factors u and d for the stock price equal eσ
√
∆t and e−σ
√
∆t, respectively, for
the CRR and stair lattices. Si denotes the stock price at year i∆t (or, equivalently, time
step i for a lattice). The stock is assumed to pay m dividends Dt1 , Dt2 , . . . , Dtm , where Dti
is paid out at time step ti. Assume that t1 < t2 < · · · < tm for convenience. Under the
discrete dividend assumption, any arbitrary dividend Dti is already known at time step 0. In
general, Dti can be determined by a function of stock prices and/or the dividends paid up to
time step ti under the path-dependent dividends assumption. The stock price simultaneously
falls by the amount αDti . For simplicity, α is assumed to be 1 throughout the paper, but a
general α poses no diﬃculties to the stair lattice. When the ex-dividend stock price becomes
negative, it is assumed to stay at zero from that point onward. Harvey and Whaley (1992),
in contrast, assume that the dividend is not paid if its amount exceeds the prevailing stock
price. The stair lattice can easily incorporate their assumption, too.
The option is assumed to start at time step 0 and mature at time step n. The strike
price for this option is K. Deﬁne (A)+ to denote max(A, 0) for simplicity. The payoﬀ for a
European option at maturity is
ﬁnal payoﬀ =
{
(Sn −K)+, for a call,
(K − Sn)+, for a put.
An American option gives the holder the right to exercise the option before maturity. The
exercise value for an American option at a non-dividend-paying time step i is
exercise value =
{
Si −K, for a call,
K − Si, for a put.
The exercise strategy for an American option at an ex-dividend date is only slightly
more complicated. It is never optimal to exercise an American call immediately after the
underlying stock pays a dividend because it is dominated by the strategy of exercising the
call immediately before. Similarly, it is never optimal to exercise a put before the stock pays
a dividend. Consequently, the exercise value for an option at a dividend-paying time step i
is
exercise value =
{
S∗i −K, for a call,
K − Si, for a put,
where S∗i and Si denote the stock price immediately before paying the dividend, and the
price immediately after paying the dividend, respectively. An option will be exercised early
by the owner if the option’s continuation value (i.e., the value to hold the option) is smaller
than its exercise value.
4.2 Construction of the Stair Lattice
The main ideas are illustrated by the 4-time-step lattice in Fig. 3. This 4-time-step stair
lattice contains two ex-dividend dates: one at time step 1 and the other at time step 3.
For simplicity, the same D-dollar dividend is paid at each ex-dividend date. The price drop

Nodes X and Y are at the ﬁrst ex-dividend date (time step 1). Both nodes are represented
by dotted ellipses. The cum-dividend stock prices at X and Y are Su and Sd, respectively,
whereas the net-of-dividend stock prices at X and Y are SX(≡ Su−D) and SY (≡ Sd−D),
respectively. The stock price for the top node at time step 2 is S ′ (= SXu). The integer
k in parentheses for each node at time step 2 means the stock price equals S ′ekσ
√

cross right above Z denotes the mean of the stock price process one time step from Y , or
SY e
(r−σ2/2)∆t. The three branches of Y are marked with thick solid lines.
a V -log-price of z implies a stock price of V ez. Since the stock price for each node on the
second tread can be expressed in terms of S ′uk for some even integer k, the S ′-log-prices for
nodes at time step 2 in Fig. 4 are integral multiples of 2σ
√
∆t .
The branches from node Y are constructed as follows. Let the ex-dividend stock price
for node Y be SY . At least three branches are required for node Y to match the ﬁrst two
moments of the logarithmic stock price process for degrees-of-freedom considerations. Three
nodes at time step 2 follow node Y . By the lognormality of the stock price, the mean and
the variance of the SY -log-prices at these nodes equal
µ ≡ (r − σ2/2)∆t,
Var ≡ σ2∆t.
Note that the distance between two adjacent nodes’ SY -log-prices at time step 2 is 2σ
√
∆t .
Thus there exists a unique node Z at time step 2 whose SY -log-price µˆ lies in the interval
[µ− σ

√
∆t).
In other words, the SY -log-price of node Z, i.e., µˆ, is closest to µ among the SY -log-prices
of the nodes at time step 2. Use µˆ to denote the mean tracker of node Y . The middle
βγ + Var ≥ 0, αγ + Var ≤ 0, and αβ + Var ≥ 0 under the premise β ∈ [−σ√∆t, σ√∆t).
Indeed,
βγ +Var = β2 − 2βσ
√
∆t + σ2∆t = (β − σ
√
∆t)2 ≥ 0,
αγ +Var = β2 − 4σ2∆t + σ2∆t = β2 − 3σ2∆t < 0,
αβ +Var = β2 + 2βσ
√
∆t + σ2∆t = (β + σ
√
∆t)2 ≥ 0,
as desired.
4.4 Extend the Stair Lattice Model to Price Options on a Stock
That Pays Path-Dependent Dividends
The stochastic dividend assumption is more general and realistic than the discrete dividend
assumption. However, the option can only be hedged if the dividends are known exoge-
nously or completely determined by the stock price process as argued in Cox and Rubinstein
(1985) unless one adds nonstandard derivatives such as the forward contracts on dividends
in Chance et al. (2002). We call Cox and Rubinstein’s assumption the path-dependent divi-
dends assumption since the future dividend, says Dti , completely depends on the stock prices
and the dividends prior to time step ti. To be more precise, Dti can be expressed as
Dti ≡ f(S0, S1, S2 . . . , Sti , Dti−1 , Dti−2 . . .)
for some function f . In reality, dividends can be explained by a variety of factors such as the
net operating proﬁts, long-run sustainable (or permanent) earnings, and so on. If the stock
prices and the dividends paid previously serve as good proxies for these factors, a dividend
function that ﬁt the path-dependent dividends assumption can be constructed. Indeed,
some empirical dividend models do attempt to ﬁt path-dependent dividends assumptions
with slight modiﬁcation. I will ﬁrst review one of such dividend models proposed by Marsh
and Merton (1987), and then show how the stair lattice can incorporate their dividend model.
Marsh and Merton (1987) derive a dividend model by following Lintner’s (1962) stylized
facts established by Linter in a classic set of interviews with managers about their dividend
policies. Their dividend model can be expressed by a regression formula of the permanent
earnings and the dividends paid previously. They argue that their formula can not be directly
estimated because management assessments of changes in a ﬁrm’s permanent earnings are
not observable. Thus they assume the permanent earing to cum-dividend stock price ratio
is a positive constant. Under this assumption, their dividend model can be expressed by
a regression formula of the net-of-dividend stock prices and the dividends paid previously.
To illustrate the main idea brieﬂy on how the stair lattice incorporate Marsh and Merton’s
dividend model, their dividend model is expressed by assuming that the length between two
ex-dividend dates is two time steps as follows:
log
[
Dt+2
Dt
]
+
Dt
St−2
= a0 + a1 log
[
St + Dt
St−2
]
+ a2 log
[
Dt
St−2
]
+ u(t + 2), (4)
where u(t+2) denotes the disturbance term at time step t+2. One of their empirical studies
uses the value-weighted NYSE index over the period 1926–81 to estimate the parameters a0,
dividend date) of a state is marked directly on that state. The settings are listed as follows.
The stair lattice begins at time step 0 with stock price 100. The length of each time step of
the stair lattice is 0.25 year, the risk-free interest rate is 10%, and the volatility of the stock
price is 30%. Thus the upward multiplication factor (u) and the downward one (d) are about
1.162 and 0.861, respectively. The settings for dividends are given as follows. The dividends
are assumed to be paid for each 2 time steps and the last dividend paid at time step -1 is
5. Let the net-of-dividend stock prices at time step -1 and -3 be 110 and 80, respectively.
Note that two dividends will be paid at time step 1 and time step 3, respectively. These two
dividends are estimated by Eq. (5).
The cum-dividend stock price at time step 1 are 100×u ≈ 116.183 and 100×d ≈ 86.071,
respectively. The dividend paid at time step 1 is obtained by substituting D−1 (=5), S−1
(=110), and S−3 (=80) into Eq. (5) to get 4.518. Thus the net-of-dividend stock prices at
time step 1 are 116.183 − 4.518 ≈ 111.666 and 86.071 − 4.518 ≈ 81.553, respectively. By
following the method for constructing the stair lattice mentioned before, the stock prices
at time step 2 can be represented as 129.737 × uk for nonpositive even integers k. The
binomial and the trinomial branching schemes for the two nodes at time step 1 can also be
constructed.
To compute the dividend paid at time step 3 (D3) by Eq. (5), three parameters S−1,
D1, and S1 are needed. While S−1 and D1 are known to be 110 and 4.518 respectively, two
possible net-of-dividend stock price (111.666 and 81.553) may occur at time step 1. These
two possible prices result in two diﬀerent dividend payouts at time step 3. Thus, additional
states are added to the stair lattice to keep the information about S1. These states are
colored in light-gray and the dark-gray to denote the cases that S1 are 111.666 and 81.553,
respectively. The branches that connect these two types of states are also colored in light-
gray and the dark-gray, respectively. Since no dividend is paid at time step 2, all the states
at the same node at time step 2 have the same stock prices. By substituting S1 = 111.666
and S1 = 81.553 into Eq. (5), we compute the dividend D3 as 4.043 and 3.547 , respectively.
For the top node (with cum-dividend stock price 150.773) at time step 3, the net-of-dividend
stock price is 150.773 − 4.043 ≈ 146.690. For the second node (with cum-dividend stock
price 111.666) at time step 3, two possible dividend payouts should be considered. The
net-of-dividend stock price is 111.666− 4.043 ≈ 107.622 for the state B that represents the
case S1 = 111.666. The net-of-dividend stock price is 111.666−3.547 ≈ 108.119 for the state
C that represents the case S1 = 81.553. The net-of-dividend stock prices for other nodes at
time step 3 can be similarly computed. The stock price for the top node at time step 4 is
146.690×u ≈ 170.249. All the stock prices at time step 4 can be represented as 170.249×uk
for nonpositive even integers k. The branching schemes for all the colored states at time
step 3 can be constructed by following the method for constructing stair lattice mentioned
before. The trinomial branching probabilities for all the states with trinomial branches are
listed in Table 1.
5 Discussions and Conclusions
I will ﬁrst give some numerical results to verify the superiority of the stair lattice model. A
simple conclusion is then given to summarize fruitful results of this project.

The numerical settings are the same as those settings in Table 2. Mix the mixture approach
of Bos and Vandermark (2002). Vol denotes the volatility adjustment approach of Bos and
Shepeleva (2002). RMSE is the root-mean-squared errors. MAE is the maximum absolute
error.
Note that MC in each two-discrete-dividend case in Table 3 is lower than that in the
corresponding case (except one case) in Table 2. The stair lattice model successfully captures
this trend, but all other models fail. Note that both Model 1 and Hull’s volatility adjustment
approach produce similar option prices in the single-discrete-dividend case and the two-
discrete-dividend case. This is because the net-of-dividend stock price in the single-discrete-
dividend case (=100 − 5e−0.03×0.6) is almost equal to that in the multiple-discrete-dividend
case (=100 − 2.5e−0.03×0.4 − 2.5e−0.03×0.8). Model 2 also produces similar option prices in
both cases since the cum-dividend stock prices for both cases are almost equal.
To derive approximation analytical formulas for Model 3, Bos and Vandermark (2002)
present an approach (denoted as Mix) that is a mixture between the stock and the strike price
adjustment or, in other words, Model 1 and Model 2. Bos and Shepeleva (2002) suggests that
the volatility of the net-of-dividend stock price be adjusted by a complex formula. Use Vol
to denote their approach. These two approaches and the stair lattice approach are compared
in Table 4 and 5. Both the root-mean-squared errors and the maximum absolute errors of
the stair lattice model are lower than those of these two approaches. Thus we conclude that
the stair lattice provides more accurate values than the other two approaches. Note Model 3
(see MC) produces lower option prices in each two-discrete-dividend case in Table 4 than that
in the corresponding case in Table 5. Bos and Vandermark’s approach successfully catches
this trend, but Bos and Shepeleva’s approach fails.
5.2 Conclusions
Traditional approaches to pricing options on discrete-dividend-paying stocks either produce
biased results or are ineﬃcient. This project suggests a recombining lattice, the stair lattice,
that solves the problem. Numerical results conﬁrm that the stair lattice is both eﬃcient and
accurate. When compared with the existing methods, the stair lattice is found to be more
eﬃcient, more accurate, and/or more general. Moreover, the stair lattice can be extended
so the a future dividend paid at time τ depends on the stock prices and the dividends up to
time τ . This extension makes the stair lattice model more realistic and ﬂexible.
6 Self Evaluation on this Project
This project provides a novel, eﬃcient numerical model for pricing options on discrete-
dividend-paying stocks. It seems that similar ideas can be applied to model the company
asset’s process when solving the credit risk problem with structural form. I plan to revise
my paper and submit it to an academic journal. I will also study how to apply the stair
lattice model to solve the credit risk problem in the future.
