Abstract 
This project concerns the development of a sliding-mode tracking controller with friction 
compensation for a precision positioning stage with cross-roller guides. Experiments including 
prerolling and rolling friction regimes are conducted, and then a two-stage parameter estimation 
algorithm is used to identify the parameters of a friction dynamic model (Dynamic NonLinear 
Regression with direct application of eXcitation, DNLRX, model). This model allows estimation of 
the friction force in combination with the system dynamics against displacement, and can be used as 
a feed-forward controller to compensate for the friction effect. To compensate for model error and 
uncertain disturbances, an integral sliding-mode controller with a disturbance estimation scheme is 
designed and combined with the DNLRX feed-forward controller to control the motion of a precision 
stage. Experimental results show that with the proposed controller, tracking performance can be 
improved.

1. INTRODUCTION 
N micro-technology and nano-technology, positioning with high resolution is necessary for measuring or 
manipulating objects. Generally, high precision stage is used to realize this task. Today’s technology 
progress in electronics, the semiconductor industry, the optical industry, biotechnology and many others 
arise the need for an enlarged operation range (mm ranges) of such stages. To realize motions up to several 
ten even hundred millimeters in a vacuum, ball bearing (or cross roller) guides are commonly used to 
support the motion axis. Under this circumstance, one of the main disturbances during dynamic motion is 
the friction force. Friction is highly nonlinear phenomenon that can lead to tracking errors, limit cycles, 
stick-slip motion and so on [1-3]. In order to achieve precision dynamic positioning over wide velocity 
ranges, frictional effects must be overcome.  
Over the past two decades, dynamic friction modeling and compensations have made great advances. 
Generally, physically or empirically motivated models in combination with efficient identification method 
based on experimental data are used for friction compensation. Several different friction models (Dahl [4], 
LuGre [5, 6], Leuven [7, 8], the generalized Maxwell-Slip [9, 10], Hsieh-Pan [11]) and identification 
techniques [12-16] have been proposed for this purpose. Many friction compensation methods based on 
these models have been proposed in [17-31]. 
Previous research on [17-19] disturbance observer methods based on the LuGre model [17, 18] and 
generalized Maxwell-Slip model [19] has been conducted. In [20], [21], and [22], adaptive compensators 
based on the LuGre model were presented. In [23] and [24], adaptive neural networks were used to 
approximate the nonlinear and uncertain parts of the LuGre model for friction compensation. In [25], a 
multi-objective H controller was designed based on the LuGre model for friction compensation and 
position control.  
Because of strong robustness properties, sliding-mode control methods have also been used to 
compensate for nonlinear friction [26-32]. In [32], a sliding-mode controller was designed to compensate 
for the friction that is modeled as a constant multiplied by the sign of the velocity. A chattering-free 
sliding-mode controller with a LuGre model-based friction compensator is considered in [26]. In [27], two 
sets of integral-type sliding-mode controllers corresponding to the Hsieh-Pan based-static friction and 
dynamic-friction model (linear viscous friction) were used to compensate for nonlinear friction. In [28], Lin 
et al. combined presliding/sliding friction models based on the Hsieh-Pan model and linear viscous friction 
to predict the friction force and then used a disturbance observer-based sliding-mode controller to reject 
external disturbances and to improve robustness in the system. In [29-31], hybrid control methods (based 
on the LuGre model) that combine sliding-mode control, neural networks, and adaptive controls were 
proposed. This type of controller can compensate for nonlinear friction well, but its computation burden is 
heavy.

by an extension of the basic Maxwell-Slip model structure that is proposed in [14], and is shown in Fig. 2. 
It consists of M elastic-slide elements, all of which have displacement )(tx  as input. Each element has 
negligible inertia, and maximum spring deformation i  and a state variable i , which represents the 
appropriate spring deformation. For spring deformation smaller in magnitude than i ( ii  ) the 
corresponding operator sticks; otherwise, it slips (
ii  ). The entire system sticks only if at least one 
operator sticks, and slides only if all elements slip. The explained sticking/slipping behavior of each 
element could be expressed in discrete time with one nonlinear state expression:

Fig. 4   Block diagram of the sliding-mode controller. 
To measure the displacement in the Z direction, interferometer Iz (SP-2000, SIOS Meßtechnik GmbH) 
is used. The laser beam that comes from the interferometer Iz is bended upward to plane mirror Mz. The 
reflected light is then used for the measurement of the displacement in the Z direction with a resolution of 
1.236 nm. By using interferometers Iy and Ix (RLE, Renishaw), the displacement along the Y-axis and 
X-axis (with a resolution of 9.8 nm) can be obtained. Fig. 6 shows the photograph of the stage and the 
measurement system. 
The real-time controller of the stage is implemented by a dSPACE system (DS1103) with a 10-kHz 
sampling frequency. The linear voice-coil motors are driven by linear current amplifiers (TA-115, Trust 
Automation) because they provide higher positioning stability than pulsewidth modulation amplifiers. 
5. Experimental Results 
The proposed control method is used to control the X-axis of the stage to investigate the performance of 
friction compensation. When executing the experiments, the Y-axis and Z-axis of the stage are locked.

5.1 Results of Identification 
First, an experiment was conducted to identify the DNLRX model of the system. The operation of the 
experiment must include both friction regimes. During identification, the input voltage of the current 
amplifier is used. Therefore, the dynamics of the drive system is included in the DNLRX model. Fig. 7 
shows the data set of the experiment and the result of the identification. The estimated value of the model 
with M=7, n=5 and 0n  is also shown in Fig. 7. The estimated input can fit the actual input relatively 
 10
the normalized root mean square (NRMS) error is 4.42%. With feed-forward friction compensation, the 
maximum error decreases to 0.73 μm, and the NRMS error becomes 2.55%. Fig. 11 shows the control 
results of the proposed sliding-mode controller. Without friction compensation, the maximum tracking 
error is 0.88 μm, and the NRMS error is 3.53%. When the friction compensation is on, the maximum error 
becomes 0.73 μm, and the NRMS error is 2.45%. 
The PID controller cannot follow the reference trajectory satisfactorily, especially at motion reversal. 
During motion reversal, the friction effect switched from the pre-rolling domain to rolling domain, and the 
friction force changed suddenly. To obtain better performance, the response speed of the controller must be 
fast. Fig. 11 shows that the disturbance estimator of the sliding-mode controller can estimate and 
compensate for some part of the friction force and provide better performance than the PID controller. 
When the DNLRX model is used as a feed-forward compensator, both the PID controller and the 
sliding-mode controller can follow the trajectory satisfactorily. Because the DNLRX model can predict the 
force needed to reach the next set-point, the task of the feedback controller is to compensate for only the 
rest of the model uncertainty and external disturbances.

6. Conclusions 
Sliding-mode tracking control with friction compensation for precision stages has been addressed. The 
DNLRX model is used to model the dynamic and friction effects of the stage. After identifying and 
verifying the model, the model error increases when the working position is different from where 
identification was executed. To compensate for the model error and unknown disturbances, a sliding-mode 
controller with a disturbance estimation scheme is designed. The DNLRX model obtained (as the 
feed-forward compensator) in combination with the sliding-mode controller (in the feedback loop) is used 
to control the motion of the stage. Experimental results show that with this controller, model error can be 
compensated for, and the tracking performance can be improved.

Abstract— Control of a two dimensional high precision 
positioning stage is presented in this work 1 . This stage is 
composed by two kinds of stages, a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) 
(X and Y) linear cross roller guideway supported stage and a 4-
DOF (Z, șx, șy and șz) piezo-stage. Two linear shaft voice coil 
motor are used to actuate the roller guided X-Y stage and five 
piezoelectric actuators are used in the piezo-stage. The 
positioning range of the X-Y stage is 25 mm ൈ 25 mm and the 
piezo-stage is designed to compensate the vertical position, row, 
pitch and yow errors throughout the whole working range. A 6-
DOF optical measurement system that consists of three laser 
interferometers and two quadrant photo-diodes is used to 
measure the attitude of the stage. The resolution of this 
measurement system is about 9.8 nm and 0.1 arc second. Integral 
sliding-mode controllers are used to control the linear motor 
driven stage while PID controllers are used to control the piezo-
stage. Experimental results show that the positioning uncertainty 
is about ±20 nm. 
Keywords- Precision stage; piezo-stage; sliding-mode controller; 
PID controller; six-degrees-of- freedom; voice coil motor. 
I. INTRODUCTION
In micro-technology and nano-technology, positioning with 
high resolution is necessary for measuring or manipulating 
objects. Generally, high precision stage is used to realize this 
task. Today’s technology progress in electronics, the 
semiconductor industry, the optical industry, biotechnology 
and many others arise the need for an enlarged operation range 
(mm ranges) of such stages. Recently, several precision stages 
that can reach mm ranges were reported [1-10]. For working 
ranges in about several tens millimeters, magnetic actuator [1-
3], voice coil motor [4] or stick and slip piezoelectric actuator 
[5] are usually used. For longer working ranges (more than 100 
mm), hybrid stages are usually applied [6-8]. This kind of stage 
has two components: a coarse stage and a fine stage. The fine 
stage, connected to the coarse stage, improves positioning 
accuracy, resolution and bandwidth, whereas the coarse stage 
carries the fine stage over long strokes. The driver used in 
coarse stage may be linear motor [6, 7], DC servo motor with 
ball-screw [8] or pneumatic cylinder [9, 10]. For fine stages, 
magnetic actuator [6, 7], piezoelectric actuator [8, 10] may be 
used. 
In this paper, the control of a two dimensional high 
precision positioning stage is presented. This stage is composed 
of two stages, a 2-DOF (X and Y) cross roller guideway

Two voice coil motors are used to drive the X-Y stage and

. The piezo-stage is 
designed for compensating the vertical positioning error and 
angle deviations.  
This paper is arranged as follows. In Section II, the 
structure of the stage is described. The 6-DOF measurement 
system for measuring the feedback signals is presented in 
Section III. Section IV describes the setup of the whole system 
and the feedback controller. Experimental results then 
presented in Section V. Finally, some conclusions are given in 
Section VI. 
II. THE STAGE
The structure of the stage that developed in this work is 
shown in Fig.1. It is composed by two kinds of stages, a 2-
DOF (X and Y) linear cross roller guideway supported stage 
and a 4-DOF piezo-stage. The piezo-stage is arranged on the 
top of the X-Y stage to compensate the vertical position, row, 
pitch and yow errors throughout the whole working range of 
the X-Y stage. In the following, these two stages will be 
described. 
A. The linear stage 
Fig. 2 depicts the structure of the two dimensional stage. 
Each axis of this stage is supported by two linear cross roller 
guide ways and is driven by a linear voice coil motor. The 
operation range of this stage is 25 ͪ 25 mm2. High rigid cross 
roller guideway (VR4-240×23Z, THK Inc.) is used to increase 
the strength of the stage. Voice coil motor (AVM60-25, LTN 
Servotechnik GmbH) is chosen because that it cause no 
backlash, no cogging force and can move smoothly at low 
speed. 
B. The piezo stage 
The structure of the piezo stage is shown in Fig. 3. This 
stage is a flexure hinge based design. All of the parts are made 
out of medium carbon steel. It is composed of four arc flexible 
bodies, three 2-DOF flexible bodies, five piezoelectric 
actuators (PSt 150/7/20 VS12, Piezomechanik GmbH), five 
preload adjusting mechanisms, working stage, șz-stage and the 
base. The actuators P1 and P2 are fasten horizontally to 
provide the uniformly rotational motion along the Z-axis (șz). 
Three actuators (Z1, Z2 and Z3) are fasten vertically. At one

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND THE FEEDBACK 
CONTROLLER
A. Experimental setup 
The block diagram of the whole system is presented in Fig. 
6. In this study, the real-time controller of the stage is 
implemented by a dSPACE system (DS1103). This controller 
has six channels of D/A outputs, three channels of A/D inputs 
and three channels of digital encoder interface with a 5-kHz 
sampling frequency. The linear voice coil motors are driven by 
linear current amplifiers (TA-115, Trust Automation) because 
they give higher positioning stability than pulsewidth 
modulation amplifiers. Five channels of piezo drivers 
(SVR150-3, Piezomechanik GmbH) are used to drive the 
piezo actuators. Two precision amplifiers (OT-301, On-Trak) 
are used to process the output currents of quadrant photo-
diodes and to transfer the position of laser light spot to 
corresponding voltage signal. 
For measuring the rotational angle correctly, the 
characteristic line of quadrant photo-diode must be determined. 
When determining the characteristic line, the stage is rotated 
by driving the corresponding piezo actuators then the 
measured rotational angle (By using an autocollimator.) and 
the output voltage of QD amplifier are recorded. By using 
these data, the characteristic line of the angle sensor can be 
determined. Fig. 7 depicts the determined characteristic lines 
for angle measurement sensors. It can be seen that the 
rotational ranges of șx, șy and șz are about ±40, ±40 and ±8 
arcsecond respectively. 
B. The feedback controller 
In this study, four single-input-single-output (SISO) PID 
controllers are used to control the piezo-stage and two integral 
sliding-mode controllers are used to control the linear X-Y 
stage as shown in Fig. 8.  
In order to design the PID controllers properly, the open 
loop frequency response of the piezo-stage is measured. When 
measuring the frequency response, a bias voltage was added to 
push the stage to the nearby of the original point. Then a 
random excitation signal was sent to the corresponding 
piezoelectric actuators, and the displacement and rotational 
angle was measured and recorded. In order to reduce the effect

of hysteresis nonlinearity, the amplitude of the excitation 
signal was kept small. Fig. 9 shows the test results obtained by 
driving the inputs utx and uty. Based on the measured results, it 
can be found that the coupling effect is weaker when the 
frequency below 100 Hz. Therefore, the PID controllers were 
designed such that the bandwidths of each SISO subsystems 
were kept below 50 Hz to avoid the effect of coupling. 
For controlling the cross roller guideway supported stage, 
two integral sliding-mode controllers with uncertainty and 
disturbance estimation scheme [11] were designed. We chose 
this controller because it has good robustness property and can 
estimate then compensate the disturbance (friction).
