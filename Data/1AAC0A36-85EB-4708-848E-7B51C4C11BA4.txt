Abstract: The difficulty to realize the addition and
subtraction operations of a voltage-mode signal makes
two special active elements, differential difference
current conveyors (DDCCs) and fully differential current
conveyors (FDCCIIs), both of which are with the ability
of addition and subtraction operations, become very
important for voltage-mode analog filter design. Note
that the recently reported Analytical Synthesis Methods
(ASMs) have been illustrated to be very effective for
achieving the three criteria simultaneously for the design
of Operational Trans- conductance Amplifier and
Capacitor (OTA-C) filters. However, none of the ASMs
uses DDCCs and FDCCIIs to do the voltage-mode filter
design. In this paper, how to realize the DDCC and
FDCCII-based all-pass filter structures with either equal
capacitance or equal conductance type through a new
ASM is presented. Only n current conveyors (the least
active component count), n grounded capacitors, and n
grounded resistors (the minimum passive component
count) are used for realizing an nth-order voltage-mode
all-pass filter structure. Moreover, the new all-pass filter
structure achieves low individual and null group
sensitivities, the smaller component spread for equal
denominator conductance design, and high input
impedance attractive for cascadability. Finally, H-Spice
simulations, using 0.35 μ m process and 65.1 V
supply voltages, validate theoretical predictions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade or so numerous current
conveyor-based second-order or high-order filters have
been reported [1-20]. Using signal-flow graph approach,
several nth-order transfer function syntheses [15-22]
using current conveyors were proposed. For example, it
needs four second-generation current conveyors, two
floating and one grounded capacitors, and seven floating
and two grounded resistors to realize a third-order
all-pass current conveyor filter [19]. Another one [21]
employs four second-generation current conveyors, two
floating and one grounded capacitors, and seven floating
and one grounded resistors to realize a third-order
all-pass current conveyor filter. In order to let all the
capacitors be grounded, five current feedback amplifiers
(CFAs), each of which is equivalent to a plus-type
second-generation current conveyor following a voltage
buffer, and a few resistors, i.e., eight floating and three
grounded resistors in addition to three grounded
capacitors are necessary for synthesizing a third-order
all-pass filter [22]. It is apparent that too many resistors
used to synthesize the above all-pass filters are the
problem and need to be reduced to the minimum.
On the second hand, since the addition and subtraction
operations of voltage-mode signals needs the addition
and subtraction circuitries for realization, respectively,
unlike the current-mode signals, two recently presented
active elements, differential difference current
conveyors (DDCCs) [23] and fully differential current
conveyors (FDCCIIs) [24], with the intrinsic voltage
addition and subtraction ability, become very attractive
used for the design of voltage-mode filters [12-14].
On the third hand, recently, the Analytical Synthesis
Methods [25-28] were clearly and effectively
demonstrated in the case of realizing high-order
current/voltage-mode Operational Transconductance
Amplifier and Capacitor (OTA-C) filters, where a
complicated nth-order transfer function is manipulated
and decomposed by a succession of innovative algebra
operations until a set of simple equations are produced
which are then realized using n integrators and a
constraint circuitry. In fact, the new analytical synthesis
method can be used in the design of any kinds of linear
system with a stable transfer function.
Therefore, the combination of both the uses of DDCCs
[23] and FDCCIIs [24] with voltage addition and
subtraction ability and of the Analytical Synthesis
Method [23-26] with very effective operations to
condense the structure is applied to the realization of
high-order voltage-mode all-pass filters in this paper.
The new Analytical Synthesis Method has been
developed in this paper for reducing the component
count of the voltage-mode high-order current conveyor
based all-pass filters. Only n-1 DDCCs, one FDCCII, n
grounded capacitors and n grounded resistors, i.e., the
least active and passive component counts when
compared to the recently reported work [19, 21, 22], are

Note that only two types of equations exist in the n
equations shown in Eqs. (13-0) to (13-n-1). The simple
equation (13-n-1) can be realized by using a negative
type of differential difference current conveyor (DDCC-)
[23] (whose input-output characteristics
are xZ II  , ,01YI ,02 YI 03 YI ,
and 321 YYYX VVVV  ), a grounded capacitor and a
grounded resistor shown in Fig. 1. Eqs. (13-0), (13-2),
(13-4) ……, and (13-n-3) similar to Eq. (13-n-1) have
the same circuit structure as that shown in Fig. 1 but
with only different capacitances and different node
voltages.

The other type of circuit implementation realized from
Eqs. (13-1), (13-3)……, and (13-n-2), which needs to
have a node with the node voltages  inout VV ' and
2nV to connect with terminals Y1 and Y2, respectively,
of the minus-type DDCC shown in Fig. 1, has the
realized circuit structure shown in Fig. 2 using a single
fully differential current conveyor (FDCCII) [24]

Eqs. (18), (19), and (21) can also be combined and
obtain a combination form similar to Eq. (20). Then, in
general, Eq. (17) can be re-arranged and combined as

PERFORMANCE
In the above section, although we assign each
conductance for Fig. 4 (resp. Fig. 7) with equal
capacitance or each capacitance for Fig. 5 (resp. Fig. 8)
with equal conductance a special value, in fact, all of the
capacitances and conductances can be given flexibly.
The restriction of the values of the conductances and the
capacitances shown in Figs. 4 and 5 (resp. Figs. 7 and 8)
is used for being consistent with the derivation process
and the original given transfer functions shown in Eq. (3)
(resp. Eq. (4)). If we replace the values of the grounded
conductors, 10 aa , 21 aa ,
32 aa , ……, 12  nn aa , nn aa 1 , in Figs. 4 and 7 by
G1, G2, G3,……, Gn-1,and Gn and the corresponding
values of the capacitances by C1, C2, C3,……, Cn-1, and
Cn, respectively, then circuit analysis yields the
following transfer functions of Figs. 4 and 7 and Figs. 5
and 8, respectively:

The denominator and numerator coefficient sensitivities
to jC and kg are easily calculated to equal unity or zero,
all of which are small.
The sensitivities of the transfer function of the proposed
third-order all-pass filter structure shown in Fig. 6 to
each individual capacitance and conductance are shown
as follows. Circuit analysis for Fig. 6 yields the

Another parameter which needs comparison when
considering different filter structures is the spread of
filter component values which may be large for
high-order filters. A wider spread of filter component
values leads to increase the total capacitance value or the
total power dissipation due to the need of larger biasing
currents, in other words, a worse implementation carried
out in CMOS processes which will create larger chip
area or the quadratic current ratios. To give insight into
what the component spread of the new filter structure is,
as an example, we have compared the component spread
of third-order Butterworth all-pass filters realized using
the circuits in [19, 21, 22] and the new third-order filter
shown in Fig. 6. The common third-order Butterworth
all-pass transfer function is given by

Table II gives the component spread for equal
denominator conductance (GD) and equal capacitance (C)
designs for the comparison of the third-order
Butterworth all-pass filters designed using the new
analytical synthesis method (Fig. 6) and those reported
in [19, 21, 22]. In Table II, GD and GN represent the
conductances in the denominator and the numerator,
respectively. The comparison results over all are shown
as below.
(i) The filters shown in Figs. 10 and 11 have the
larger component spread for both equal
capacitance and equal denominator
conductance designs.
(ii) The filter shown in Fig. 12 has the smaller
component spread for equal capacitance design.
(iii) The new proposed filter shown in Fig. 6 has the
smaller component spread for equal
denominator conductance design.
Table II Component spread comparison of third-order
all-pass Butterworth filters
Finally, only the new third-order all-pass filter has high
input impedance good for cascadability with the former
stage circuit. Moreover, it should be noted that a voltage
follower may be necessary at the output of each of the
above three filters shown in Figs. 6, 10, and 11 (except
the one shown in Fig. 12) to buffer the output and avoid
the effects of load capacitance or resistance changing the
response of the filter.
V. H-SPICE SIMULATIONS
To verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed equal
capacitance filter structures shown in Fig. 6, a
third-order all-pass filter has been simulated using the
H-Spice with TSMC035 process ( 1.65V supply
voltages), and the CMOS implementations of the DDCC
and FDCCII presented in [23, 24]. The component
values are given by all C=20pF, R1=3.98kΩ, R2=7.96k
Ω , and R3=15.9k Ω . The simulated all-pass
phase-frequency is shown in Fig. 13 with simulated
fo=986.54k Hz (1.35% error when compared with the
theoretical 1MHz). As can be seen, there is a close
agreement between theory and simulation. On the other
hand, the sensitivity simulations have also been done.
The sensitivity simulations with +5% C1, +5% C2, +5%
C3, +5% R1, +5% R2, and +5% R3 tolerances have
fo=976.9k, 958.7k, 976.8k, 977.5k, 958.3k, and 976.9k
Hz, with -0.97%, -2.81%, -0.98%, -0.91%, -2.86%, and
-0.97% errors (compared with the nominal fo=986.54k
Hz), respectively. These show that all of the individual
