1. Introduction 
  From the viewpoint of applied mechanics, 
one of the most important characteristics of 
superplastic materials is the high strain rate 
sensitivity of flow stress. The strain-rate 
sensitivity exponent, m (in the 
approximation of mKεσ &= ), is the key in 
controlling the ductility of a superplastic 
material at elevated temperatures: the higher 
the value of m, the higher is the necking 
resistance. However, fine-grained 
superplastic materials exhibit high m-values 
only in a narrow range of strain rates, 
requiring careful process control to maintain 
the desired constant strain rate during 
superplastic forming (SPF). A significant 
problem in the commercial application of 
SPF on AZ31B alloy is low deformation 
rates (10
−3
–10
−4
 s
−1
) compared with other 
metal forming processes [1-4], which is 
undesirable in mass production. 
  Recently, to extend the industrial use of 
SPF, efforts have been devoted towards 
reducing forming times. As a result, quick 
plastic forming (QPF) technology has been 
developed [5-7]. The major difference 
between SPF and QPF lies in the 
deformation controlling mechanism. 
Superplasticity corresponds to deformation 
conditions in which grain boundary sliding 
(GBS) is the dominant controlling 
mechanism, with a value of m close to 0.5. 
However, the dislocation creep is expected 
to be the major deformation mechanism at 
higher strain rates and/or at lower 
temperatures [6,8,9], which are the 
deformation conditions for QPF. The 
dislocation creep produces medium 
strain-rate sensitivity (m ~ 0.33 to 0.2), 
although not as high as that of GBS creep. 
Moreover, it can provide sufficient tensile 
ductility [8,10,11]. QPF has been mainly 
studied in the case of Al alloys [9,12-15] 
and, to a much lesser extent, in the case of 
Mg alloys [8,16,17]. 
One of the authors recently examined the 
tensile flow behavior of a fine-grained 
AZ31B Mg alloy thin sheet and found an 
m-value of approximately 0.27 at a 
temperature of 370°C, with initial strain 
rates in the range of 4×10
−3
 to 1×10
−1
 s
−1
 
[18]. This result implies that for a 
fine-grained AZ31B Mg alloy, the 
dislocation creep can be the controlling 
mechanism and QPF could be a possible gas 
blow forming process. In the present study, 
further, the deformation characteristics of a 
fine-grained AZ31B alloy were investigated 
using the stepwise pressurization profiles 
and constant pressure forming, with the 
intention of reducing forming time during 
gas blow forming. The effects of 
pressurization profiles on gas blow 
formability were studied. Results were 
quantitatively analyzed, and a detailed

PT300-160, PT370-150, and PT420-142 
were classified as low pressurizing rate 
profiles. Meanwhile, PT370-75, PT420-71, 
and PT420-83 were classified as high 
pressurizing rate profiles. 
The fine-grained AZ31B sheets were 
successfully formed into hemispherical 
domes at 300–420ºC following the 
pressurization profiles depicted in Fig.3. 
Although the dome could be formed at a 
temperature as low as 300ºC, it took a higher 
pressure and a longer time because the 
material had a higher flow stress. The final 
dome height revealed that forming at a low 
temperature of 300ºC would decrease 
formability. A lower pressure could be used 
to achieve a similar dome height at a higher 
temperature. The forming time could be 
significantly shortened using a profile with a 
higher pressurizing rate at the same 
temperature. 
  Constant pressures during forming were 
used to compare the deformation 
characteristics with those of the stepwise 
pressurization profiles. A constant pressure 
of 1.18 MPa for forming at 370ºC has been 
performed in this work. However, 
theforming failed at a dome height of 
approximately 16 mm. At a higher 
temperature of 420ºC, the sheet was 
successfully deformed into a hemispherical 
dome at a constant pressure of 0.74 MPa 
(PT420-83). Although the forming 
temperature of the pressurization profile 
PT370-75 is lower than that of PT420-83, 
using a stepwise pressure increment could 
reduce the forming time to achieve a similar 
dome height to that of PT420-83. This result 
indicates that a stepwise pressurization 
profile is likely to be a better process in 
reducing forming time at lower 
temperatures.

increases in instantaneous strain rates 
occurred. Fig. 5b reveals that the significant 
thinning at the apex observed at the 
beginning of forming is consistent with the 
relatively high instantaneous strain rate 
imposed for forming at PT420-71 and 
PT420-83. Rapid increases in the 
instantaneous strain rates at the end of 
forming also led to the significant decreases 
in thickness for forming at PT370-75 and 
PT420-71. 
  Deformation behavior is presented in 
Fig. 6 as a relationship between dome apex 
height and forming time. Two different 
evolution behaviors could be observed for 
forming at various pressurization profiles.

Using a stepwise pressurization profile 
provides a nearly linear relationship of the 
dome height with forming time; whereas, 
forming with a constant or near constant 
pressurization profile exhibits a near power 
law relationship. Chung et al. [19] 
investigated the biaxial forming behavior of 
fine-grained AZ61 Mg alloy sheet using 
constant gas pressure and reported that the 
deformation process could be characterized 
by three distinctive regions. Initially, the 
height of the deforming dome increases 
rapidly, and an apparent steady state 
deformation stage is then reached. Finally, 
the deformation rate increases again as the

is subjected to a gas pressure to develop a 
part of the hemispherical geometry, the 
orthogonal stresses are equal at the apex, 
and the stress state is that of equi-biaxial 
tensile. At the edge of the dome, the 
constraint of the clamped sheet around the 
periphery results in a plane strain. A stress 
state gradient is evident from the apex of the 
dome to the edge in this geometry. The flow 
behavior of a fine-grained alloy sheet obeys 
the von Mises criterion [22]; hence, the apex 
experiences a higher stress than the edge, 
leading to a higher strain rate. The stress 
gradient in a forming dome causes a more 
rapid thinning at the apex, resulting in a 
strain rate gradient. Fig. 8 also shows that a 
more uniform distribution of the average 
strain rate was observed for forming at a 
higher temperature of 420ºC. A more 
uniform distribution of the average strain 
rate could lead to a more uniform 
deformation, reducing the gradient effect. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The deformation behaviors of a 
fine-grained AZ31B Mg alloy sheet were 
examined by gas pressure forming tests at 
temperatures of 300, 370, and 420ºC with 
various pressurization profiles in this work. 
Using the proposed pressurization profiles 
led to a non-constant strain rate deformation, 
which allowed the average strain rate at the 
apex in the order of 10
−2
 s
−1
 to be reached 
and the forming time to be reduced. The 
maximum average strain rates of 1.43x10
−2
 
and 1.56x10
−2
 s
−1
 were achieved for forming 
at temperatures of 370 and 420°C, 
respectively. It was feasible to form a 
hemispherical dome with a height of 
approximately 19 mm in less than 85 s at a 
temperature higher than 370ºC. A higher 
pressurizing rate could significantly reduce 
the forming time for forming at the same 
temperature. Two distinctive regions in the 
variation in instantaneous strain rate with 
forming time were observed for forming 
under a stepwise pressurizing profile, while 
a relatively high strain rate was found at the 
beginning of deformation under a constant 
or near constant pressure forming. The 
thinning behavior at the dome apex could be 
associated with the variation in 
instantaneous strain rate with forming time, 
and the evolution of the dome height with 
forming time related to the stress developed 
at the apex.
