2. Literature Review 
Earlier studies supported the notion that 
adopting IT is beneficial. The prior research 
also indicated that IT plays an important role in 
knowledge management (Robinson et al., 2004; 
Yin et al., 2008; Tserng and Lin, 2004; Tserng, 
and Chang, 2008; Abdul-Rahman et al., 2008; 
Carrillo et al., 2004; Chang et al, 2008; Chen et 
al., 2008; Egbu, 1999; Glass, 2005). A review 
of the literature suggests that the adoption of IT 
as a means to enhance knowledge management 
activities has been supported. As indicated by 
the literature, IT applications may be positively 
related to knowledge management.  
Generally, many researchers have 
suggested that IT provides significant benefits 
to knowledge management. On the other hand, 
knowledge management has been shown to 
play an important role in the performance of 
organizations or projects. In previous research, 
knowledge management was found to be 
associated with a critical determinant of 
performance outcomes (Liu et al., 2004; 
Adenfelt, 2010). Additionally, Carayannis 
(1999) investigated the role of knowledge 
management in fostering a synergistic 
symbiosis between IT and organizational 
cognition. The prior studies indicated that 
knowledge management may play a mediating 
role in the relationship between information 
technology and performance outcomes. This 
study extends previous studies by addressing 
the associations among information technology, 
knowledge management, and capital facility 
project performance. Based on the relevant 
literature, the following hypotheses were 
postulated and tested: 
H1: IT applications are positively 
associated with capital facility project success. 
H2: Knowledge management may have a 
positive impact on capital facility project 
performance. 
H3: Knowledge management may act as a 
mediator between information technology and 
capital facility project performance. 
 
3. Research Methodology 
3.1 Survey Process 
A survey instrument was used to measure 
the degree of IT and knowledge management 
use on capital facility projects and their 
associations with project performance in the 
Taiwanese construction industry. Study 
participants were first asked to identify a recent 
project that they were familiar with for 
assessment. For the subject project, the survey 
requests the participant to provide information 
about the levels of IT applied on the projects. 
The second section of the survey measures 
levels of knowledge management on the subject 
project. The third section evaluates the 
performance of projects from various aspects. 
The fourth and fifth sections obtain information 
concerning the project and the respondent.  
 
3.2 Sample Selection and Data Collection 
Capital facility projects in the Taiwanese 
construction industry were considered in this 
study. An industry-wide survey of IT 
applications, knowledge management, and the 
performance of projects was conducted 
between March and June 2010. The data 
collection tool was developed to collect project-
based data. Individuals participating in the 
study were identified by a search from various 
industry associations and an investigation of 
several online databases. The targeted 
respondents were identified as the senior 
individuals who were familiar with capital 
facility projects. In order to obtain a truly 
representative sample, not only was the 
geographic mix of projects intentionally diverse, 
but a diverse mix of participation was sought 
with respect to project type. Additionally, a 
specified mix of project budget and duration 
was targeted in order to obtain a representative 
sample of the industry.  
All of the companies were then contacted 
via phone or email to identify the manager or 
the person involved in projects by name and 
title. Project responses were collected from all 
sources and by all means, including phone/fax

have received substantial attention, the number 
of studies dealing with the impacts of IT and 
knowledge management on capital project 
success is rather scarce. This study attempts to 
fill this void of empirical evidence by 
identifying the quantitative relationship among 
IT applications, KM adoption, and project 
performance in the construction industry.  
The findings of the research indicate that 
IT applications for project management appear 
widely accepted. IT applications are 
significantly related to levels of project 
performance. The results also suggest that KM 
fully mediated the effects of IT on project 
success in terms of schedule performance, cost 
performance, quality performance, and overall 
satisfaction. 
In summary, this research provides 
empirical evidence that supports the 
expectation of gaining significant benefits with 
higher levels of IT applications and KM 
practice. Findings from this study are helpful to 
managers in deciding whether to adopt IT and 
KM practice on capital projects.

derived from integration technology application. Research on integration utilization at 
the phase and task levels and its associations with project success should offer 
tangible evidence of advantages from using technologies. 
For the purposes of this research, the integration is defined as the sharing of 
information between project participants or melding of information sourced from 
separate systems (O’Connor et al. 2000). While many studies have promoted 
technology as a means to enhance project performance, very few published empirical 
studies in construction have explored the direct effects of integration on project 
deliverables from the perspectives of various types of stakeholders. Empirical 
evidence that supports the link between integration usage and project deliverables is 
lacking. Thus, developing such support will illustrate the benefits of integration 
technology adoption. This study attempts to fill this void of empirical evidence by 
identifying project deliverable-leveraging tasks and common characteristics 
associated with these critical tasks. The purpose of this research is three-fold. The first 
objective of this study was to examine empirically the impact of phase-level 
integration technology adoption on project deliverables. The second objective was to 
identify project deliverable-leveraging tasks. The third objective was to investigate 
the characteristics associated with these project deliverable-leveraging tasks to gain 
deeper insights into how integration usage may impact project success. Project 
success parameters analyzed include correctness, timeliness, completeness, and 
flexibility of providing deliverables. 
 
2. Literature Review 
A considerable body of research has been conducted on the adoption and use of 
information technology in the A/E/C industry. Much of the project/construction 
management literature relevant to this research is associated with the adoption of IT, 
factors influencing the implementation of IT, and the expected benefits associated 
with the use of IT. Issues discussed include the use of IT for specific project tasks, 
technology strategy, and the application of integration. The review of the literature 
suggests that the use of information technology as a means to enhance project 
performance has been widely supported. Generally, many researchers have suggested 
that information technology provides significant benefits to capital facility projects. 
The primary objectives of any construction project generally fall into three 
categories: cost, schedule, and quality. Thus, project performance is usually measured 
in the three major areas, which are of primary interest to the project stakeholders. 
While many studies have evaluated the technology investments in deriving the 
probable benefits to the project and promoted technology as a means to enhance 
project cost and schedule performance (Griffis et al. 1995; Back and Moreau 2000; 
  
Taiwanese industry, levels of technology utilization are the most uniform for the 
Design phase and relatively dispersed for the Construction Management phase. In the 
U.S. industry, levels of technology utilization are least-dispersed for the Construction 
Execution phase and relatively variable for the Operations/Maintenance phase. 
Some previous studies discussed the use of specific technologies; however, 
these technologies may quickly become out-dated. If a new metric is to be employed 
over a longer period of time, the metric should be task-based, in order to ensure some 
degree of longevity (Kumashiro 1999). One advantage of measuring technology by 
task is the relative stability in the project tasks. In summary, there has been much 
research conducted on the use of specific technology and the benefits derived from its 
application, although little work has been done on technology use in common tasks on 
projects. Thus, it is useful to develop a measure that encompasses common project 
tasks. 
There has been also much work conducted on the valuation of IT and its 
associations with the level of success in other industries (Doerr et al. 2006; Clemons 
1991; Epstein and Rejc 2005; Jin 2006; Closs et al. 1997). Researchers in a number of 
disciplines outside of construction have also suggested that technology is becoming 
increasingly critical to assist in the management functions of planning, operations, 
and control (Evangelista and Sweeney 2006). To address this gap in the literature, the 
following research hypotheses were developed: 
 H1: Levels of integration utilization in certain project phases correlate with 
projects’ levels of correctness/timeliness/completeness/flexibility of providing 
deliverables 
 H2: Levels of integration utilization in certain project tasks correlate with 
projects’ levels of correctness/timeliness/completeness/flexibility of providing 
deliverables 
 H3: Task characteristics can explain the links between integration utilization 
and correctness/ timeliness/completeness/flexibility of providing project 
deliverables. 
 
3. Research Process 
This research was divided into two phases. Phase 1 included determining the degree, 
if any, to which phase- and task-level integration usage contributes to quality of 
project deliverables. An industry-wide survey of integration use levels on capital 
facility projects was conducted in Taiwan between October 2004 and June 2005. 
Phase 2 of the research entailed explaining the links between integration utilization 
and quality of project deliverables. The survey of characteristic applicability was 
conducted between February 2006 and April 2006. As such, the survey in Phase 2 was 
  
For each project, major stakeholders including the Owner, A-E, and GC were 
interviewed to examine the degree of integration usage on capital facility projects and 
the impact of integration on quality of deliverables. A total of 110 interviews 
(structured interviews) were conducted and some were not included in the analysis 
because they contained insufficient information. Each interview encompassed three 
executives from the Owner, A-E, and GC groups (one from each group). In addition, 
the projects were examined to ensure that no duplicate project information was 
collected. Ultimately, 98 project responses were used in the analysis. Characteristics 
of sampled projects are presented in Table 2. 
 
4.3 Measurement: Integration Usage Metrics 
Most prior literature simply measured the level of money invested on technology 
(Weill 1992; Li and Ye 1999) rather than the level of utilization. Measuring dollar 
investment on technology does not necessary guarantee effective use of technology 
(Jin 2006). The research assessed the degree of integration technology used in 
executing tasks on capital facility projects. The measures for integration were based 
on O’Connor et al. (2000), which developed specific measures for technology 
implementation levels. In assessing the degree of integration used in executing each 
task, respondents could choose from four levels: Level 1, where no electronic tools 
are used and information is conveyed verbally or on paper. Level 2, where there are 
“3 or fewer” specialized electronic tools involved and information is stored in a 
stand-alone electronic format. Level 3, where “more than 3” specialized electronic 
tools are involved and information is stored in a stand-alone electronic format. Level 
4, where integrated electronic tools are used. Information is stored on a networked 
system where all participants can access and share information easily. Levels 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 are associated respectively with the lowest, medium low, medium high, and 
highest levels of integration utilization in executing tasks. The characteristics of four 
levels provide quantitative measures of integration usage for each task. In addition, 
“Not Applicable” and “Don’t Know” responses were also available for each item.  
Task integration index was developed to measure the use of integration 
technology for common project tasks across the industry. For any given task, the level 
of integration employed is the task score. The sum of these scores was then divided by 
the total number of responses to yield the integration index for that task. The Phase 
Integration Index is a measure of the level of integration technology used in a single 
phase of a project. The Phase Integration Index was then computed to equally weight 
all associated task score. 
 
 
  
studies (O’Connor et al. 2000; Welch 1998; Juran et al. 1974; Crosby 1979; Ishikawa 
1985; PM4DV2007; Olsson 2006; Chinyio et al.1998; Yang et al. 2007) and seven 
discussions with construction executives. A specified group involvement was targeted 
in order to acquire a comprehensive knowledge from different perspectives. The 
industry interviews encompassed nine executives from the Owner, A-E, and GC 
groups (three practitioners from each group). The interviewees included 3 presidents, 
1 design manager, and 2 project managers, and 3 project engineers. With respect to 
years of experience, 3 of the interviewees are more than 20, 3 are between 16 and 20, 
and the remaining 3 are between 10 and 15. These professionals averaged 18 years of 
experience. Furthermore, 1 of the interviewees indicated that he held a Ph.D. degree, 
while another 5 held a master's degree. The remaining 3 held a bachelor's degree. The 
refined assessment items were included in the final survey. Based on previous studies 
and discussions with these construction experts, the four levels from O’Connor et al. 
(2000) were accepted as possessing content validity. Consideration was also given to 
determine if the 61 tasks can be applied to various types of projects during the 
development of survey items. Each task was then tested to ensure it was fundamental 
to the project delivery process. Effort was made to seek project tasks common to most 
projects. Finally, copies of a draft survey were sent to several industry professions to 
pre-test for the clarity of questions. Their insights were also incorporated into the final 
version of the survey. 
The construct validity was tested by factor analysis. The primary purpose of 
factor analysis is data reduction and summarization. Factor analysis is a statistical 
technique design to (1) reduce the number of variables and (2) detect structure in the 
relationships between variables, that is to classify variables (Hill and Lewicki 2007). 
Alwin (2000) identified four uses for factor analysis: (1) scale construction, (2) 
exploration, (3) conformation (hypothesis-testing), and (4) latent variable. Factor 
analysis has been widely used to assess the construct validity of a test or a scale (Hair 
et al. 1998). A factor analysis can be used to investigate the validity of the construct 
included in an instrument. More specifically, the factors can correspond to constructs 
of a theory (Green et al. 2000). This technique is useful when a researcher wants to 
construct scales from sets of questionnaire items. Factors were extracted using 
varimax rotation. As suggested by Hair et al. (1995), an item is considered to load on 
a given factor if the factor loading from the rotated factor pattern is 0.40 or more for 
that factor. Two items were dropped due to low factor loadings. These two items are 
"Field input on construction methods” and “Contractors submit requests for 
payment.” Finally, the factor loadings for the items used in the study are more than 
0.40 with an average value of 0.73.  
 
  
interviews encompassed nine executives from the Owner, A-E, and GC groups (three 
practitioners from each group). The interviewees included 2 presidents, 1 vice 
president, 2 design managers, 1 project manager, and 3 project engineers. With 
respect to years of experience, 2 of the interviewees are more than 20, 4 are between 
16 and 20, and the remaining 3 are between 10 and 15. These professionals averaged 
17 years of experience. Furthermore, 1 of the interviewees indicated that he held a 
Ph.D. degree, while another 6 held a master's degree. The remaining 2 held a 
bachelor's degree. Based on previous research (Won 2002) and the six discussions 
with construction experts, the survey items were accepted as possessing content 
validity. The draft version of the data collection instrument was then sent to several 
construction professionals to pre-test for the clarity of questions. Their insights were 
incorporated into the final version of the survey. 
 
5.3 Analysis of Responses 
For any given characteristic, the assessed degree to which a task relates to that 
characteristic was established as the Characteristic Score. In order to perform 
quantitative analysis, responses were converted to Characteristic Scores as follows: 
Strongly Agree = 4, Agree = 3, Neutral = 2, and Disagree = 1. The mean 
Characteristic Applicability Index was then calculated to identify the characteristics 
with high applicability to the project deliverable-leveraging tasks. A Characteristic 
Applicability Index score of zero indicates “not applicable.” A value of 3.00 or 
greater indicates “highly applicable” (an index value of 3.00 is associated with Agree 
response). If a characteristic has high applicability to the project 
deliverable-leveraging tasks, it indicates that this characteristic may explain project 
deliverable-leveraging. 
 
6. Results and Analysis 
6.1 Project-Level Integration Usage and Project Success 
Table 2 present project-level integration index descriptive statistics for each of the 
data class variables. The overall highest mean level of integration technology usage is 
associated with Large projects. Beyond Large projects, generally higher levels of 
integration technology usage are associated with Medium projects. This may be 
explained by the fact that Large and Medium projects are more often high-stakes 
projects. Small projects are often neglected in general and this appears to be true in 
terms of the levels of technology used as well. The overall lowest mean level of 
integration technology usage is associated Industrial projects. In addition, the 
integration utilization level of Public projects is higher than that of Private projects. 
There doesn’t appear to be linkage between the use of technology and the profit 
  
information- and data-intensive tasks are involved in the Design phase. These data- or 
information-intensive tasks are easily computerized using integration technology. 
This may be a reason way the Design phase is more associated with quality of project 
deliverables than other phases. In addition, many tasks in the Construction phase are 
labor intensive and involve mechanization. Thus, advancements in automation may 
tend to precede those in integration for tasks in the Construction phase. Tasks 
involved in the Construction phase may be more associated with “automation” due to 
their labor intensive and mechanized characteristics for which “integration” is 
difficult to accomplish. 
 
6.3 Identification of Project Clusters with the Same Perceptions of Quality 
Cluster analysis was used in an exploratory mode to develop an objective 
classification of projects. This research was exploratory; therefore, different sets of 
clusters consisting of two, three, four, and five groups were examined. In order to 
identify homogeneous projects clusters with the same kinds of perceptions of 
correctness, a K-means cluster analysis was performed on the basis of the correctness 
dimension. To validate the results of the cluster analysis, a discriminant analysis was 
conducted. Discriminant analysis is a useful tool for detecting the variables that allow 
the researcher to discriminate between different groups. This technique has been 
widely used to validate the cluster solutions (Romensburg 1985). Once the clusters 
are formed, discriminant analysis can be used to observe what internal variables 
account for the clustering (Hair et al. 1998; Afifi and Clark 1990; Aldenderfer and 
Blashfield 1984).  
The cluster analysis has identified two clusters for correctness, with the cluster 
mean values of discriminating variables given in Table 5. The discriminant analysis 
classified 100.0 percent of the projects as the cluster analysis did, indicating 
extremely good differentiation and a correct classification. These results further 
suggest that the two clusters are distinctive. In addition, independent-samples t tests 
were undertaken to assess the internal validity of the cluster results. The 
independent-samples t tests shown in Table 5 confirm that the variable of correctness 
does significantly differentiate across the two clusters. Combining these results with 
those of the discriminant analyses, the analysis ended with a two-cluster solution. The 
analysis also indicates that the three-, four- and five-cluster solutions are not adequate. 
Specifically, the cluster analysis has identified two clusters for correctness, including 
high correctness cluster (Cluster 1) and low correctness cluster (Cluster 2). The 
analyses indicate that Cluster 1 has, on average, higher levels of correctness than 
Cluster 2 from the perspectives of major stakeholders involved in projects, including 
the Owner, A-E, and GC groups. Thus, Cluster 1 is associated with project success 
  
7. Conclusions and Recommendations 
While many studies have promoted technology as a means to enhance project cost and 
schedule performance, very few published empirical studies in construction have 
explored the direct effects of technology on project quality. The purpose of this study 
was to examine empirically the impact of phase-level integration adoption on the 
quality of project deliverables and identify project deliverable-leveraging tasks and 
common characteristics associated with these critical tasks. Regression analyses were 
used to investigate the degree to which the four quality dimensions were influenced 
by the five phase-level integration practices. Based on the regression analyses, the 
models of correctness and completeness are statistically significant. Furthermore, 
hypothesis testing was performed to determine the relationships between task-level 
integration utilization and quality of deliverables. For each of the tasks, levels of 
integration usage were analyzed to identify project deliverable-leveraging tasks. The 
tasks with a significant difference in integration usage between projects with high and 
low quality are associated with project deliverable-leveraging tasks. The correctness-, 
completeness-, and flexibility-leveraging tasks were further analyzed using 
characteristic analysis to explain the links between integration utilization and project 
success. The analyses suggest that data/information intensive and management-related 
characteristics greatly influence the quality of project deliverables. The key findings 
are presented in Tables 6 and 7. 
The previous research supported the various effects of time saving by 
implementing IT. There may be several reasons why there are no significant 
associations between technology and project timeliness in this study. First, the metric 
developed to assess schedule success in this research is different from those used in 
the previous studies. In this research, timeliness represents the degree to which all 
project assignments are completed on-schedule. However, time measurement 
commonly used in the previous studies is project schedule performance. This metric 
measures the degree to which the project is completed on time. Second, technology 
assessed in this study is integration technology. Electronic tools may not be the only 
way to measure the IT application. Different types of technology applications may 
have different impacts on the project performance parameters. 
In summary, this study developed a total of 61 “common” project tasks, which 
are commonly performed on a wide variety of capital facility projects, including 
projects in highly developed and developing countries. The questionnaire items used 
in this study were designed to eliminate cultural response bias. In addition, this study 
provides objective measures of integration technology usage for each task. Thus, the 
results may be generalized to other countries’ industries. This research identifies the
