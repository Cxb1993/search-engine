with the intermolecular acids (e.g. benzoic acid, isophthalic acid, and trimellitate)19 or 
intramolecular acidic groups (carboxylic or amino acid groups).20 In this study, a 
series of novel soluble PEG-imidazole compounds were synthesized and investigated 
as thermal latent catalysts for the polymerization of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A 
(DGEBA) under liquid–liquid or liquid–solid (≧ PEG1000) phase-separated 
systems.21  
The soluble polymer-supported synthesis22 of small organic molecules is a 
subject of intense research activity due to they profit from both the advantageous 
features of homogeneous solution chemistry23 (high reactivity, lack of diffusion 
phenomena, analytical simplicity) and of solid-phase methods (ready isolation and 
easy purification of the products).22,24 Modified poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs) are 
very popular soluble supports.24a,25 They are inexpensive,21b,26 diversification to 
provide the functional and different molecular weights PEG supports, and readily 
functionalized with different spacers and linkers.27 They are insoluble in nonpolar 
solvents and simply purified by precipitation. As a consequence, the synthesis and the 
immobilization of several organic molecules on PEG supports have been reported 
over the last few years.21b,25,28,29  
In this paper, we reported first use of soluble PEG-imidazole compounds 1–430 
with different molecular weight PEG supported materials as the thermal latent 
catalysts for the polymerization of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). Their 
structures were shown in Scheme 1. In liquid–liquid or liquid–solid phase-separated 
systems, soluble PEG-imidazole catalyst serves as the form-stable composite at room 
temperature in epoxy resin system. At elevated temperature (>175 oC), the 
ring-opening reaction of epoxy resin (DGEBA) could be initiated by attacked with the 
imidazoyl nucleophilic part of PEG-imidazole catalysts to underwent propagation and 
polymerization. Finally, the polymerization was terminated by the protonation of 
 - 4 - 
diethylether (50 mL), which was stirred and cooled at 0°C. After 20 ± 30 min stirring 
at 0 °C, the obtained suspension was filtered through a sintered glass filter and the 
solid was repeatedly washed on the filter with diethylether (up to 100 mL). The 
residue was recrystallized from ethanol/ether to obtain the soluble PEG-Imidazole 
products 1 (in 81% yield), 2 (in 83% yield), 3 (in 86% yield), and 4 (in 78% yield) as 
white solids.

performed under a flow (30 mL/min) of dry N2. Temperature scans were performed 
from 30–300 °C at heating rate of 10 °C/min. The amount of sample was limited to 
12–15 mg to minimize the experimental errors. The glass transition temperature (Tg) 
of the cure of DGEBA (DGEBA, NPEK-114M, 188–199 g/eq) with the soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalyst 1–4 at a concentration of 3 wt % are measured and 
determined by a second run; the thermogram presents no residual heat. The epoxy 
(DGEBA) with commercially available imidazole was also done for comparison 
purpose. 
Result and Discussion 
Synthesis of soluble PEG-imidazole compounds (1–4)   
The different molecular weights of soluble PEG-imidazole compounds were prepared 
by following the previous published procedure using mesylation and substitution 
reactions (see Scheme 2).30 Various poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEG, 5), including 
PEG-200, 400, 600, and 1000, were successfully converted to mesylate products  
(MsO–CH2(OCH2CH2O)nCH2–OMs, 6) in good to excellent yields by means of 
mesylchloride with triethylamine. Consequentially, the mesylated compounds (6) 
were reacted with commercially available catalyst imidazole and cesium carbonate in 
DMF solution to afford a serous of soluble PEG-Imidazole products 1–4 in 78 – 86% 
yields as white solid.

The curing mechanism study of DGEBA with new soluble PEG-imidaz
thermal latency catalysts (1–4) 
The curing mechanism for DGEBA
 was proposed and shown in Scheme 3.  The first initiation step in curing 
process is involved the nucleophilic attack by the N-3 of the imidazole to open the 
oxirane ring of DGEBA for the formation of alkoxide anion. The nature of soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalysts affected the overall rate of polymerization reaction. 
Continuously, three types of propagation reactions were happened to cause chain 
growth for polymerization at elevated temperatures. Three propagated etherifications 
contained another imidazole moiety of catalyst, the new formation alkoxide anion,  
and the hydroxyl group of DGEBA,  would attack the additional epoxide groups in 
epoxy resin to perform the propagation. In the etherification propagation process, the 
imidazoyl group and alkoxide anion would contribute to the mainly efficiency and 
determine the final properties of the network for the cross-linking polymerization. 
Finally, the polymerization was terminated by protonation or hydrogen-migration.

The cure behaviors of DGEBA resin with imidazole, 2E4MZ-CN, and soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalysts 1–4 (3% w/w) were studied with TG/DTA in the dynamic 
scanning mode at different heating rates. The cure activation energy (Ea) of the overall 
process was determined by the Kissinger method: 33-35

Differential Thermometry Analysis (TG/DTA).  
Results from TG/DTA analysis for the curing of DGEBA by use of soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalysts 1–4 at four concentrations were summarized in Table 2, 
which showed the exotherm onset, exotherm peak, and total heat for the 
polymerization. We found that the peaks shifted towards lower temperatures when the 
amounts of catalysts 1–4 were increased. That might due the enhancement of the 
reaction rate by more catalysts.36 Total heat output revealed that all the 
polymerizations were exothermic, and that for the curing by typical imidazole and 
2E4M-CN (1–5 wt %) were 64–862 J/g.18 For soluble PEG-imidazole compounds 1–4 
possessing two nucleophilic imidazole moieties, the higher exothermic heats were 
generated (184–794 J/g, 1–5 wt %, see Figure 5 and 8). The total heat output is 
important to evaluate the feasibility for the curing system, for the reason that too little 
total heat output indicates that no polymerization take place. However, too high total 
heat output revealed that the reaction may not be scaled up to industrial scale with a 
satisfactory safety level.37

Measurement of glass transition temperature (Tg) and Conversion. 
The glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important single parameters to determine 
the applications and properties of polymer materials.38 The Tg values of DGEBA 
cured with catalyst depend on the amount and property of the catalysts,39 the epoxide 
equivalent weight of DGEBA, and the blending agents (i.e. hardener, and filter).38 For 
DGEBA cured with imidazole and 2E4M-CN, the Tg value indicated the complete or 
near complete curing systems in 151 °C and 150 °C, respectively.18 When soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalysts 1–4 were applied in curing DGEBA, the Tg value could be 
obtained, which ranged from 152 °C to153 °C (see Table 3 and Figure 9). The 
PEG200-imidazole catalyst (1), containing more imidazole equivalent amount in the 
same weight, were able to participate the polymerization and thus increased the 
crosslinking density of the polymer.40 As a result, the Tg values and the thermal 
stabilities were enhanced in this curing system by use of 1.

The water-absorption properties. 
For the study the water-absorption of the polymers, DGEBA resin and soluble 
PEG-imidazole catalysts 1–4 (3 wt %) were mixed and cured at 150 °C for 7–8 h. The 
polymers were chopped into specimens of 3 × 7 × 50 mm in size and exposed to 
humid environments (72 h at 85°C/85% R.H.). The resulting moisture absorptions 
were obtained from weight difference and found to be lower than 1%. When the 
specimens in same size were cook in the boiling water for 48 h, the average 
water-absorptions were also lower than 0.7 wt %.   
Conclusions 
In this work, we successfully developed a series of soluble PEG-imidazole 
compounds 1–4 as the curing agents to initiate the polymerization in the molding 
temperature (100–175 oC). Due to the liquid–liquid two phase system, the reactivity 
of imidazolyl moieties of PEG-imidazole catalysts was reduced in the curing epoxy 
resins to provide the good latent properties. Based on the studies of the viscosity and

Novel soluble PEG-imidazole compounds were evaluated as thermal latent catalysts 
for the polymerization of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). Commercial 
available catalysts containing imidazole and 2E4MZ-CN were used as compassion 
molds with soluble PEG-imidazole catalysts to cure epoxy resin systems to 
investigate their thermal latency and storage stability. Results from the cure activation 
energy, the viscosity-storage time and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the 
catalysts, the soluble PEG-imidazole catalysts showed better thermal latency than 
commercialized catalysts.
