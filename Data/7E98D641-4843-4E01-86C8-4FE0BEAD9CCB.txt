examine the dermal absorption capability among various glycol ethers in vitro. They found 
that EEAc was similar to its parent compound, 2-ethoxyethanol, having relatively high 
dermal absorption capability (Dugard et al., 1984). Johanson and Boman exposed male 
human volunteers to ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE) vapor at 50 ppm via inhalation 
and skin for two hours separately and they concluded that the dermal EGBE vapor uptake 
accounted for about 75% of the total uptake during whole body exposure. (Johanson and 
Boman, 1991). Dugard et al further found that the skin permeability capability for EEAc 
was even higher, about 4-fold of EGBE (Dugard et al., 1984). Several lines of indirect 
evidences from the field studies also suggested that exposure through the dermal tract 
could play a more important role with respect to the total body burden in the actual 
occupational environment. A field study conducted in a varnish manufactory found the 
urinary EAA levels among the EEAc-exposed workers were 167.8 mg/L, relatively higher 
than BEI of 100 mg EAA/g creatinine, but the airborne EEAc concentrations were only 
about 2.7 ppm, only about a half of current TLV of 5 ppm (Angerer et al., 1990). Another 
field study carried out in a painting plant lead to a similar conclusion based on the finding 
of no significant correlation (r = -0.082, p = 0.708) between airborne EEAc and post-shift 
urinary EAA as well as no apparent decrease in the post-shift urinary EAA for the workers 
wearing a respirator (Vincent et al., 1994). These findings conducted using in vitro, human 
volunteers and human field studies consistently indicated that the dermal exposure for 
EEAc could not be overlooked. To date, however, no actual EEAc dermal exposure 
measurements were performed in any human field studies. The lack of empirical 
measurement could result in the incapability in the identification of dermal exposure 
source and the further development of quantative dose-response relation of inhalation 
and/or skin exposure to total body burden of EEAc exposure. Therefore, the purposes of 
this study were to explore the relations between dermal EEAc exposure to airborne EEAc 
and identify the dermal exposure source from various anatomical sites. Moreover, the 
extracted with 1.5 ml carbon disulfide (HPLC grade; Tedia, Fairfield, OH, USA) as 
extraction solvent for 30 min before instrumental analysis. Analysis was performed using 
gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Hewlett- 
Packard 5890 series II, CA, USA) using splitless injection. The injection port and detector 
temperatures were at 230˚C and 250˚C, respectively. A DB-WAX (WCOT coating with 
1.0 μm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) column 0.53 mm ID and 30 m 
in length was used as the analysis column. The oven temperature was initially 55˚C for 2 
min, and then increased at a programmed rate of 6˚C/min to a final temperature of 100˚C 
for 2 min. The hydrogen, air, nitrogen (carrier gas), and nitrogen (make-up gas) flow rates 
were 40, 400, 6.3, and 13.7 ml/min, respectively. All sample analysis was completed 
within 1 week of the sample collection. 
All quality assurance protocols for the sampling and analysis were completed before the 
field study. The high and low concentration calibration curves of airborne EEAc ranged 
from 160 to 1926 μg/ml and 2.5 to 160 μg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) 
of this method, determined by three times the signal-to-noise ratio at the concentration of 
2.5 μg/ml, was found as 1.3 μg/ml. The correlation coefficients (γ) of the calibration 
curves were > 0.995. The recovery tests were conducted by spiking three different levels 
(1 ×, 2 ×, and 4 × PEL) of liquid EEAc solution into the charcoal. The recovery test 
result was 94.5%±4.66% (mean ± standard deviation (SD)). All of the airborne samples 
in the field study were adjusted for the recovery. 
 
Environmental Monitoring for Dermal Exposure to EEAc 
Personal dermal exposure monitoring was conducted for each participant using post shift 
tape stripping during five continuous workdays. After the factory walk- through and 
consultation with the participating workers, the investigators decided that the possible skin 
exposure sites for workers were the hands and forearms because other body sites were 
 Data Analysis 
The Shapiro-Wilks W-test was performed to assess the normality of the airborne and 
dermal sample concentrations. The one-way analysis of variation (ANOVA) was used to 
determine whether the difference was significant between day-to-day airborne EEAc and 
day-to-day dermal EEAc. The Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) test and 
Mann-Whitney U test were used in post hoc comparisons. The Pearson Correlation test 
was used to determine the correlation between airborne EEAc and dermal EEAc. The 
Spearman Rank Order Correlation was used to determine the correlation of the day-to-day 
airborne EEAc among five continuous workdays. Multiple linear regression was used to 
determine the main determinants significantly associated with dermal EEAc 
concentrations. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistica Software (release 6.0; 
StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) was used for all statistical analysis. 
 
RESULTS 
The demographic data for all 20 participants showed their average age and working 
duration were 28.2 (± 3.3) y/o, 5.3 (± 4.2) yrs, and that 12 (60%) were male. The 
proportions of alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking were 15% and 20%, respectively. 
General compliance to the wearing personal protective equipment among the participants 
was relatively poor. No workers wore respiratory masks and only a quarter of the 
participants wore protective gloves while they cleaned the template (Table 1). 
(Table 1 should be shown here) 
The airborne concentration distribution was shown to have a normal distribution. 
Therefore, the arithmetic mean (AM) and standard deviation (SD) were used to present the 
central tendency and the degree of dispersion of the airborne EEAc measurements. The 
time-weighted air concentration averages (mean ± SD) of EEAc for all the participants in 
levels could be categorized into two groups: W3, W4 and W5 were at higher end while 
W2 and W6 at lower end (Table 4). Basically, the dermal exposure levels were generally 
consistent with the air concentrations, i.e., W4 and W5 were at higher end and W6 at the 
lower end.  
(Table 4 should be shown here) 
When the skin exposure locations were examined, we found the dermal EEAc 
concentrations on the palms highest (GM = 0.79 μg/cm2), following by the dorsum, 
interior forearm, and exterior forearm (GM =0.56, 0.52, and 0.56 μg/cm2, respectively), 
and second lowest on forehead (GM = 0.41 μg/cm2), and the lowest on backneck (GM = 
0.32 μg/cm2) (Table 5). EEAc exposure on the palms were 1.4-fold, 1.8-fold, and 2.3-fold 
higher than the dorsum-forearm, forehead, and backneck, respectively. This finding is 
consistent with the field observation that EEAc was used to clean the printing template 
using the bare hands and suggested that the dermal exposure levels decreased while the 
distances to the emission source increased. 
(Tables 5 should be shown here) 
Although the day-to-day variability of dermal exposure levels were substantial (Table 
4), the concentration fluctuations were quite consistent across the five consecutive days 
and individually dependent, namely, once an employee’s dermal EEAc concentration was 
high on Tuesday, his dermal concentrations would be also relatively high on the rest of the 
day (Table 6). A similar consistency was also observed for examining the dermal exposure 
distribution among various anatomical sites. Significantly satisfactory coefficients of 
correlation (all P values<0.05), ranging from 0.71 to 0.86, were found among various 
anatomical sites (Table 7). Indicating the concentration distribution was quite consistent 
over different skin locations and individual-dependent.  
(Tables 6&7 should be shown here) 
When the relationship between airborne EEAc concentrations and the exposure levels 
even after the adjustment of other potential affecting variables. Moreover, both 
within-variability and between-worker variability posed substantial effects on dermal 
exposure although between-worker variability only reached marginal significance. 
Moreover, for the within-worker effect, dermal concentrations could be significantly 
different day to day within a week (P<0.001). When peering at the finding in Table 4, we 
could conclude that the dermal concentrations could increase toward the end of the week 
for the same worker. On the other hand, a slight but not significant effect of 
inter-individual variability on dermal concentrations could be found. After adjusting other 
factors, the differences in dermal concentrations on different skin sites were significant 
(P<0.001). This finding along with that in Table 5, indicating some skin sites like palms 
could have higher exposure than other sites like beckneck. Again, the multiple regression 
analysis outcome revealed the similar finding in gloves as shown in Table 9: gloves might 
have most protective effects on palms than the other skin sites. The relatively high model 
R2 of 0.71 suggested that other unexpected variables could only affect the variability of 
dermal EEAc less than 30%. Taken together, all the findings in the multiple regression 
analysis were supportive of the previous univariate analyses (Tables 4, 5 and 9) 
 (Tables 10 should be shown here) 
 
DISCUSSION 
Recognition of the significance of EEAc dermal exposure on body burden has been 
shown in several literatures. Direct and indirect laboratory study evidence has shown that 
the dermal exposure for EEAc could not be overlooked (Dugard et al., 1984; Kezic et al., 
1997). These EEAc skin absorption conclusions, however, might be different from those 
in the field due to the difference between exposure scenarios. Such as the study conducted 
by Dugard et al. used diffusion cell to estimate the skin absorption parameters. That was a 
quite different exposure scenario from that of the factory workers, who only contacted 
relatively high boiling point of EEAc (156 °C), the assumption could be accepted to some 
degree. In addition, exposure from both skin lipid and skin vapor was considerable (Mraz 
et al., 1992; Yang et al., 2000). Both liquid and vapor forms of EEAc were measured 
together by using the tape stripping method. However, this study was not able to make a 
clear distinction between them. 
Due to the inter-day and inter-individual variability of the exposed chemical 
concentrations in the workplace are normally enormous (Buringh and Lanting, 1991; Lin 
et al., 2005), there is a need to evaluate whether the air-skin relationship and the 
distribution of dermal exposure among various anatomical sites were different over a week. 
The EEAc levels on six different anatomical skin sites were found significant in the 
association with airborne EEAc (Table. 8). For EEAc-exposed workers, therefore, besides 
direct contact with the EEAc solvent by the hands, airborne EEAc could also be another 
important source of skin exposure. 
In this study, we found that there were significant differences between the dermal 
exposure of EEAc levels across five consecutive working days (p < 0.001) (Table 4). 
These results were similar to the airborne EEAc levels across five consecutive working 
days and were also consistent with our observation, highest workload on Thursday and 
Friday, during sampling period. In addition, we also found that there is significant 
difference between the EEAc dermal exposure levels among six skin locations from 20 
workers (p < 0.001) (Table 5). The highest dermal EEAc level showed in palm (GM±
GSD=0.79 μg/cm2) and was significant higher than other anatomical sites. This could be 
due to the highly opportunity of direct contact of solvent with palms during the cleaning 
process. Moreover, the dermal EEAc levels among six skin locations decreased by degree 
following by the distance away from the printing machines.
