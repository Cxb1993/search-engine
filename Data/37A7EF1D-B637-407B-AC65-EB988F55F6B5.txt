were bonded onto the flex substrates, specimens 
were utilized to assess the reliability of the HTS, 
PCT, TCT and (HT/HH) tests. Environmental 
parameters used in the reliability test were 
consistent with joint electron device engineering 
council (JEDEC) specifications. After the 
reliability test, the die-shear test was applied to 
examine changes to the die-shear forces. The 
microstructure of test specimens was analyzed to 
evaluate reliability and to identify possible 
failure mechanisms. 
Die-shear force decreased slightly as HTS test 
duration increased. When the duration of the 
HTS test was increased, the percentage of gold 
bumps that peeled off of the surface of copper 
pads on the chip side increased, and 
delamination existed at the bonding interface 
between gold bumps and bond pads of silicon 
chips. This delamination was due to thermal 
stress generated during the HTS test, and 
degraded the die-shear force of the assembly of 
chips and flex substrates. A clear atomic 
interdiffusion of gold and sliver was obtained by 
Auger line scanning after the specimen was 
subjected to the HTS test at 150°C for 1000 h. 
Atomic interdiffusion effectively improves the 
bonding strength. However, die-shear forces 
decreased slightly as the duration of the HTS test 
increased, indicating that decreases in die-shear 
forces during the HTS test were dominated by 
delamination between gold bumps and the bond 
pads of silicon chips.  
With the PCT, die-shear forces decreased 
significantly as test duration increased, and 
die-shear forces were lower than the minimum 
requirements in the JEDEC specifications for 
test durations of 96-336 h. Delamination existed 
at the interface between deposited layers of 
copper electrodes after specimens were 
subjected to the PCT for various durations, and 
the typical failure mode was deposited layers of 
copper electrodes being pulled out by gold 
bumps after the die-shear test. Fracture location 
was the Ni/Cu interface. This delamination was 
mainly due to the inability of the deposited layer 
to withstand the high moisture, high pressure, 
and high temperature of the test environment. 
Moisture penetrated into the deposited layers of 
copper electrodes, deposited layers lost their 
adhesion, and delamination propagated to the 
bonding area from outside of the bond area to 
the central bond area as test duration increased. 
The gold bumps finally separated fully from the 
surface of copper electrodes; thus, die-shear 
forces decreased significantly as the PCT 
duration decreased.  
Die-shear forces were significantly decreased 
with increasing the tested periods of TCT from 0 
to 400 cycles, and then die-shear forces varied in 
the narrow range of 545 gf and 535 gf for further 
increasing tested periods of 400 to 1000 cycles. 
The die-shear forces were slightly below the 
minimum required measure of 547 gf. Three 
categories of fracture modes can be found in the 
specimens subjected to TCT after die-shear test, 
gold bumps peeled-off from the surface of bond 
pads on silicon chips, the deposited layer of 
copper electrodes was pulled-out by gold bumps 
and gold bumps peeled-off from the surface of 
copper electrodes. As increased the tested 
periods of PCT, gold bumps peeled-off from the 
bonds of silicon chips became a major fracture 
mode, and the dleamination existed at bonding 
interface between the gold bump and the bond 
pads of silicon chips. This delamination was 
contributed to that thermal stress forming due to 
mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient 
between the gold bump and the silicon chip.  
A blister appeared on the surface of bond pads 
of silicon chips after the HT/HH test with 
various tested periods. The moister penetrated to 
deposited layers of bond pads and then results in 
forming the defect of the blister. The major 
fracture mode was gold bumps pulled-out the 
deposited layers of bond pad after HT/HH test. 
The die-shear forces would depend on the 
location of blister formation after HT/HH test. A 
die-shear force would decrease if the blister 
formed at bonding area between the gold bump 
and the deposited layers of bond pads. Thus, an 
obvious fluctuation of die-shear forces was 
observed after specimens subjected the HT/HH 
test with various tested periods.

三、文獻回顧 
隨著高科技產業的發展日新月異，使得
電子產品所用的元件朝向輕、薄、短小及高功
能性之高精密技術發展，促使產品尺寸微小化
及方便攜帶。晶片與軟性基板接合技術，大部
分採用膠合製程之覆晶接合技術居多，但此一
製程須精準控制膠之固化溫度與固化時間
[1-2]，顯見需控制之製程參數遠較熱音波直接
接合為多，而熱音波覆晶接合於軟性基板，因
軟性基板具撓性，超音波功率不易傳遞至接合
介面，但如鍍著一層鎳膜將有助於超音波功率
傳遞至接合介面，以提升接合強度與接著率
[3-5]。Ji[6]等人以超音波銲線製程，將金線銲
著於鋁銲墊上，經過高溫儲存後發現，金線與
鋁銲墊間生成介金屬化合物(IMC)，因金線與
鋁銲墊之擴散速率差異，介金屬化合物生成同
時，易產生成柯爾達孔洞(Kirkendall voids)，
此孔洞隨高溫儲存的時間增長而增加，最終孔
洞聚合而成裂痕。Breach[7]等人探討金線與鋁
銲墊於高溫儲存測試中之失效機制，於高溫儲
存 1500 小時後，剪力測試明顯下降，於金相
所示，未經高溫儲存測試之金凸塊與矽晶片銲
墊之接合介面完整，未發現脫層等缺陷，而經
高溫儲存 400 與 1000 小時候，金凸塊與矽晶
片銲墊間可清楚發現脫層之缺陷，但金凸塊與
軟性基板之介面接合良好且未發現缺陷，推論
此脫層缺陷之產生原因為矽晶片具較佳之剛
性且銲墊鍍層材料與金凸塊存在熱膨脹係數
之差異，故於長時間與高溫之測試環境中，矽
晶片銲墊與金凸塊之接合介面易產生熱應
力，進而於金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊接合周圍產生
脫層之缺陷，該缺陷可能導致高溫儲存測試
後，矽晶片與軟板剪力值微幅衰退之原因。 
5.1.3 破斷面分析 
觀察剪力測試後之破斷模式 (fracture 
mode)，可歸納出三種破壞模式出現於未經高
儲存測試或經高溫儲存測試後之試片，分別為
金凸塊連同軟板鍍膜拔離(pull-out)、金凸塊與
軟板鍍膜間產生剝離(peel-off)、金凸塊與矽晶
片銲墊間之剝離(peel-off)，如圖四所示。金凸
塊連同銅電極鍍膜拔離之破壞模式顯示金凸
塊與軟板銅電極之接合強度大於銅電極鍍膜
之接著力，故於剪力測試時由銅電極鍍膜層間
破裂，如圖四(a)所示；而金凸塊與銅電極表面
剝離或金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊表面剝離之破壞
模式，圖四(b)、(c)所示，均表示金凸塊與軟
板銅電極或金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊表面之接著
情況不佳或經高溫儲存測候其接合介面產生
缺陷所致，此兩種破壞模式均可能引致矽晶片
與軟板接合強度之下降。 
比較未經高溫儲存測試與在不同高溫儲
存測試時間下，剪力測試後，金凸塊與軟板銅
電極破壞模式之變化，如圖五所示。未經高溫
儲存測試之試片經剪力測試後，其主要之斷裂
模式為金凸塊連同軟板鍍膜拔離與少量金凸
塊於銅電極表面剝離之破裂模式，並未出現金
凸塊與矽晶片銲墊剝離之破裂模式，圖六(a)
所示為軟板銅電極於剪力測試時，部分鍍膜被
拔離而形成凹洞之表面型態，且於破裂周圍出
現微小裂縫(crack)，圖六(b)為剪力測試後金凸
塊殘留於矽晶片之表面型態圖，以能量光譜儀
(EDS)檢測軟板銅電極與金凸塊殘留於矽晶片
之組成元素，點 1(point 1)之組成元素為銅，
點 2(point 2)之組成元素為鎳與銀，此一分析
結果說明銅電極之部分鎳膜與銀膜於剪力測
時，轉移至金凸塊表面，於銅電極表面形成凹
洞，該結果顯示金凸塊與軟板銅電極具良好之
接著強度。 
圖七為高溫儲存測試 1000 小時後，矽晶
片與軟板經剪力測試後之破裂模式，圖七(a)、
(b)為金凸塊連同軟板鍍膜拔離之破裂模式，相
對圖六所示未經高溫儲存測試之破裂模式相
似，在軟板側部分鍍膜被拔離而形成凹洞；圖
七(c)、(d)為金凸塊與軟板銅電極鍍膜間之剝
離，該破裂模式僅在軟板側表面留下金凸塊接
著痕跡，且無銅電極鍍膜被拔離，但剪力測試
後殘留於矽晶片側之金凸塊產生明顯變形且
軟板銅電極鍍膜產生裂縫，顯示該斷裂模式之
接合強度雖低於鍍膜拔離之破裂模式，但其接
合強度不致太低；圖七(e)、(f)為金凸塊與矽晶
片銲墊間剝離(peel-off)之破裂模式，金凸塊殘
留於軟板側，而矽晶片銲墊接著區中間部分出
現銲墊鍍膜被拔離而形成凹洞，銲墊接著外圍
區域則未出現鍍膜拔離現象，顯示金凸塊與銲
墊接著區之外圍部份在未進行剪力測試時，已
出現脫層之缺陷，而該脫層缺陷來自於高溫儲
存測試時所形成之熱應力所致，此一結果與圖
三金凸塊橫截之觀察結果相符。 
隨高溫儲存測試時間增長，金凸塊連同銅
電極鍍膜拔離之破裂模式便逐漸下降，而由金
凸塊與軟板鍍膜間產生剝離、金凸塊與矽晶片
銲墊間之剝離破裂模式隨之提高，如圖五所
示。顯示於高溫儲存測試中，因矽晶片與金凸
塊之熱膨脹係數差異，因而於接合介面產生熱
應力，導致斷裂於晶片端之百分比增加，此一
結果引致矽晶片與軟板接合強度之微幅下
降，斷面觀察結果與高溫儲存測試後橫截面觀
察結果(圖三)、剪力值之變化(圖一)相符。 
5.1.4 接合介面之歐傑電子能譜儀分析 
以歐傑電子能譜儀進行線掃瞄 (line 
scanning)分析接合介面間原子之交互擴散現
象，圖八(a)為高溫儲存 1000 小時後，金凸塊
與 軟 板 銅 電 極 之 接 合 介 面 微 結 構
(microstructure)，圖中可清楚發現金凸塊與軟
板銅電極具良好接著且無孔洞或脫層等缺
陷，銅電極鍍膜與金凸塊間未發現介金屬化合
物(intermetallic compound)之存在，圖八(b)為
接合介面元素之線掃瞄結果，經高溫儲存 1000
小時後，金銀原子明顯產生交互擴散，少量金
原子擴散至鎳層中，該金、銀原子之交互擴散
有助於提升接合介面之接著力。 
綜整上述之實驗結果得知，經高溫儲存測
試後，金銀原子產生明顯交互擴散，應有助於
接著強度之提升，但金凸塊與晶片銲墊間因熱
膨脹係數差異所引致金凸塊於晶片端形成接
合介面之脫層缺陷，隨高溫儲存時間之增長，
由晶片端斷裂之模式增加，故高溫儲存測試
後，矽晶片與軟板之剪力值較未進行高溫儲存
測試者之剪力值微幅下降。 
5.2高溫蒸煮測試 
5.2.1剪力測試 
矽晶片接合於軟板之試片經高溫蒸煮測
試後，以剪力測試矽晶片與軟板剪力值之變
化，矽晶片接合於具鎳鍍膜軟板之剪力值隨高
溫蒸煮試驗時間增長而大幅下降，且於測試時
間 96 小時候，該剪力值低於 JEDEC 規範最低
溫度循環測試之矽晶片與未鍍鎳膜軟板試片
之接合強度遠低於 JEDEC 規範之最低要求，
亦即接合試片內存在許多接合缺陷或接合品
質不佳，故於溫度循環測試時，其剪力值下降
幅度較低。 
5.3.2 破斷面分析 
矽晶片接合於具鎳膜軟性基板試片經溫
度循環測試 1000 週期後，剪力測試後之斷裂
模式(fracture mode)可為三類，分別為凸禿塊
自銅電極鍍膜拔離(pull-out)、金凸塊與軟性基
板接合介面之剝離(peel-off)與金凸塊由晶片
端銲墊剝離(peel-off)，三種斷裂模式分別圖四
(a)、(b)與(c)所示。 
溫度循環測試 1000 週期後，軟板銅電極
鍍膜被金凸塊拔離而形成銅電極之破斷面如
圖十五(a)，圖十五(b)所示為從軟板銅電極鍍
膜拔離而殘留於矽晶片側之金凸塊，由軟板之
破斷型態圖可清楚發現銅電極之鍍膜於剪力
測試時，部分鍍膜被拔離而留下凹窩且殘留裂
縫於銅電極表面，而殘留於矽晶片端之金凸塊
則 出 現 剪 力 測 試 後 之 塑 性 變 形 (plastic 
deformation)，此一破裂模式與未經溫度循環
測試之破斷模式相似，如圖六(a)與(b)所示。
為進一步確認軟板銅電極鍍膜被拔離鍍膜之
成分(composition)，以能量光譜儀分析於軟板
銅電極鍍膜剝離處(point 1)，顯示該凹窩之鍍
膜為銅，如圖十五(c)所示，而殘留於晶片端之
金凸塊(point 2)主要成分為鎳、磷與銀，如圖
十五(d)所示，此一分析結果顯示銅電極鍍膜被
拔離的薄膜轉移至金凸塊上方，而且拔離介面
位於鎳膜與銅膜之接合介面，金凸塊與銀膜之
接合強度甚至高於銅電極鍍膜間之接著力，而
軟板銅電極未被拔離區域(point 3)之主要組成
為金與銀，如圖十五(e)所示，此結果說明部分
金凸塊殘留於軟板銅電極，顯示金凸塊與銀膜
具良好接著強度，晶片側凸塊中間區域(point 4)
之主要組成為金與銀，如圖十五(f)所示，銅電
極表面之銀膜亦部分轉移至金凸塊，代表金凸
塊中間部分與軟板銅電極接著。由破斷面組成
元素之分析與觀察殘留金凸塊產生明顯塑性
變形之結果，得知此種斷裂模式顯示金凸塊與
軟性基板具良好之接合強度。 
矽晶片接合於金凸塊經溫度循環測試
1000 週期且經剪力測試後，金凸塊由軟性基
板銅電極鍍膜剝離之破斷面，如圖十六(a)與(b)
所示，軟性基板之銅電極鍍膜並未剝離，接點
邊緣也未發現裂痕，僅留下金凸塊與軟板銅電
極之接著區域，且殘留於矽晶片端之凸塊未產
生明顯之塑性變形。由能量光譜儀分析軟板銅
電極表面接合區域之中間部份(point 1)與接合
區域之外側部分(point 2)，兩者之主要組成元
素為銀，如圖十六(c)與(d)所示，顯示無任何
金凸塊殘留於軟板銅電極表面。對殘留於矽晶
片金凸塊之中間(point 3)與金凸塊外側(point 4)
進行元素分析，前者之主要組成元素為銀，後
者主要為銀與金，如圖十六(e)與(f)，由元素分
析之結果顯示，金凸塊與銅電極之接合品質不
佳，銅電極鍍膜無明顯拔離且凸塊亦無明顯之
塑性變形，且僅部分銀膜轉移至金凸塊之外側
區域，此種破斷模式顯示矽晶片與軟板之接合
強度不佳。 
試片經溫度循環測試 1000 週期後，金凸
塊斷裂於晶片端銲墊而殘留於軟板之破斷
面，如圖十七(a)與(b)所示。以能量光譜儀分
析殘留於軟性基板端之金凸塊，金凸塊上中間
部分(point 1)之主要組成為銀，如圖十七(c)所
示，顯示金凸塊該區域係由晶片銲墊鍍膜銀層
剝離；分析金凸塊周圍區域(point 2)之主要組
成元素為金，如圖十七(d)所示，推論該區域未
進行剪力測試時，金凸塊與矽晶銲墊存在脫層
(delamination)之缺陷，故其外觀呈現平滑且剪
力測試後未發現矽晶片銲墊鍍膜元素。矽晶片
銲墊鍍膜剝離處(point 3)之主要組成元素為
鈦，未剝離處(point 4)之主要組成元素為銀，
如圖十七(e)與(f)所示。由元素分析與破斷表面
型態之觀察，得知此類破斷形式稱生於矽晶片
端鍍膜，矽晶片銲墊周圍並無裂痕產生，且金
凸塊也未變形，由此推論矽晶片銲墊與金凸塊
經可靠度測試後，其接合介面已產生脫層缺
陷，故此類破斷模式顯示矽晶片與軟板之接合
強度不佳。 
為進一步說明斷裂模式與溫度循環週期
之關係，統計所有溫度循環試驗試片金凸塊總
數之破斷模式，如圖十八所示，當隨溫度循環
週期增加，金凸塊於晶片端銲墊剝離和金凸塊
與軟性基板接合介面剝離之斷裂模式百分比
隨之增加，此兩種斷裂模式均顯示矽晶片與軟
性基板之接合強度不佳。金凸塊於軟板銅電極
拔離之斷裂模式隨溫度循環週期增加而降
低，但於溫度循環 400 週期後，此種斷裂模式
維持於 20-25%區間，此破斷模式之趨勢與剪
力值之變化(圖十四)相符，且溫度循環 400 週
期後，金凸塊於晶片銲墊剝離之斷裂模式約佔
50-60%，故推論此種破模式為剪力值下降之主
因。 
試片經溫度循環後，統計試片所有金凸塊
斷裂模式之發生位置，將本實驗使用矽晶片之
金凸塊分為外圍與中央兩的部分，屬外圍之金
鍍膜均可能形成氣泡狀之脫層缺陷，而該缺陷
為恆溫/恆濕測試下，水氣進入矽晶片鍍膜層
所形成之缺陷，導致剪力測試時金凸塊接著於
銲墊鍍膜全部拔離，甚至金凸塊接著附近之鍍
膜亦可能遭拔離，而矽晶片與軟板之剪力值隨
測試時間之變動，應受氣泡脫層缺陷出現於金
凸塊與銲墊接著區數量多寡而影響，因而矽晶
片與軟板之剪力值隨恆溫恆濕之測試時間而
變動。 
六、結論 
高溫儲存測試後矽晶片與軟板之剪力值
出現微幅下降，隨高溫儲存測試時間之增長，
金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊之剝離個數隨之增加，且
於橫截面之觀察金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊出現明
顯的脫層缺陷，該脫層缺陷為高溫儲存測試
時，金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊間因熱膨脹係數差異
產生熱應力所致。歐傑電子儀分析結果得知高
溫儲測試存後，金凸塊與銅電極間明顯出現
金、銀元素之交互擴散，但矽晶片與軟板之剪
力值並未隨之提升，推論高溫儲存測試後，矽
晶片與軟板之接合強度主要金凸塊與晶片銲
墊間產生之脫層缺陷所主導。 
經高壓蒸煮測試後，矽晶片與軟板之剪力
值大幅下降，並低於業界相關規範之要求，矽
晶片與軟板接合試片於高壓蒸煮之破壞機制
為高壓蒸煮之蒸汽由金凸塊與銅電極接合之
鍍膜層滲入，造成銅電極鍍膜間產生脫層之缺
陷，隨測試時間之增長，侵入水氣隨之增多，
造成金凸塊與軟板銅電極分離而失效，致使矽
晶片與軟板之接合強度大幅下降，脫層之缺陷
出現於銅電極鍍膜之銅膜與銀膜間，故由此失
效機制推論填充底膠(uderfill)防止高壓水氣之
滲入或以製程改善銅膜與鎳膜於高壓蒸煮測
試之接著力，應是有效提高矽晶片與軟板於高
壓蒸煮可靠度之方法。 
溫度循環測試後，矽晶片與軟板之剪力值
明顯下降，由破斷模式數量之統計，得知金凸
塊與矽晶片銲墊產生剝離之破斷模式隨循環
週期增加而提高，該種斷裂模式大量出現於矽
晶片外側之金凸塊，且金凸塊與矽晶片銲墊出
現完全分離之缺陷，反觀矽晶片中間部分之金
凸塊大多接合良好則接著良好，因金凸塊與矽
晶片於溫度循環測試時產生熱應力而產生金
凸塊與矽晶片銲墊脫層之缺陷，且矽晶片外圍
產生叫大變形，故外圍凸塊易出現與矽晶片銲
墊完全分離之缺陷，該缺陷亦造成矽晶片與軟
板剪力值之大幅衰退。 
恆溫/恆濕測試後，矽晶片與軟板之剪力值
於測試初期明顯下降，之後隨測試時間增長而
產生高低之變動，觀察剪力測試後之主要斷裂
模式為金凸塊從矽晶片銲墊鍍膜拔離且矽晶
片鍍膜出現氣泡狀之脫層缺陷，該缺陷形成原
因為恆溫 /恆濕測試時，水氣進入銲墊鍍膜
中，長時間加熱下使銲墊鍍膜失去接著強度而
形成氣泡之脫層缺陷，該脫層缺陷為剪力值下
降之主要因素。 
綜整上述之實驗結果，降低金凸塊與矽晶
片銲墊間之熱應力與防止濕氣進入金凸銅電
極鍍膜、矽晶片銲墊鍍膜為確保矽晶片與軟板
可靠度之有效方法。

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence 
of the nickel layer on the bondability and die-shear force of 
chips and flex substrates they were assembled using 
thermosonic flip-chip process. The copper electrodes over the 
flex substrate that were electroplated with a 0.5μm-thick 
nickel layer on the surface of copper film and the silver film 
was then deposited on the nickel layer to be as the bonding 
layer. This nickel layer was expected to improve the 
bondability and die-shear force of the assembly of chips that 
were thermosonically flip-chip bonded on the flex substrates. 
The thermosonicially flip-chip bonded experiments were 
conducted using an automatic thermosonic flip-chip bonder 
developed by ITRI. After chips bonded on the flex substrates, 
a subsequent die-shear test was performed to evaluate the 
bonding quality according to the JESD22-B116 standard. 
Chips were successfully thermosonically flip-chip bonded 
on the copper electrodes that deposited with a 0.5μm-thick 
nickel layer using the adequate parameters. 100% bondability 
can be obtained and the die-shear force was higher than the 
minimum required values stated in the JEDEC standards for 
the assembly of chips they were thermosonically flip-bonded 
on copper electrodes with depositing a 0.5μm-thick nickel 
layer. A poor bondability and low die-shear force were 
existed when chips thermosonically flip-bonded on the copper 
electrodes that the nickel layer without depositing on them. 
According to observation on the surface morphology of the 
copper electrodes that were deposited with the nickel layer, a 
clear bonding trace can be observed, indicating the nickel 
layer was effective to improve propagation of the ultrasonic 
power to the bonding interface between the copper electrodes 
and the gold bumps. Enhancing the bonding quality of the 
assembly of chips and substrates during thermosonically flip-
chip bonded process. Both bonability and the die-shear force 
are thus improved. In this study, the adequate bonding 
parameters of chips they were thermosonically flip-bonded to 
the flex substrates were an ultrasonic power of 20.66 W, a 
bonding force of 625 gf, a bonding time of 0.3 s and a 
bonding temperature of 200°C. 
Deposition of the 0.5μm-thick nickel layer on the copper 
electrodes over flex substrates is effective to improve the 
bondability and die-shear forces of the assembly of chips they 
were thermosonically flip-bonded on the flex substrates. 
Keywords: Thermosonic flip-chip bonding, Flex substrate,

Introduction 
The flex substrates have been widely used in consumed 
electronic products due to their flexibility and lighter than 
those of the rigid substrates. However, the thermal stability 
and mechanical properties of flex substrates are inferior to 
those of rigid substrates. Several challenges must be 
overcome before flex substrates can be used in the packaging 
of electronic products. For example, the thermosonic flip-
bonded process is difficult to be applied to the assembly of 
chips and flex substrates. The temperature of the thermosonic 
bonding of gold balls onto rigid substrates is approximately 
200°C [1]. Most flex substrates soften at such an elevated 
bonding temperature and dynamic sinking therefore occurs 
during thermosonic bonding [2]. Furthermore, the ultrasonic 
power could not propagate to bonding interface between the 
gold ball and the copper electrodes, and the bonding 
efficiency of the ultrasound is thus reduced. The gold ball 
cannot well bond on the copper electrode over the flex 
substrate [3]. 
In a flip-chip-on-flex (FCOF) assembly, the anisotropic 
conductive paste (ACP) and the non-conductive paste (NCP) 
were added to bind the chip and flex substrate [4, 5]. To 
obtain a sound bond with the sufficient bonding strength 
between the chips and the flex substrate, the curing time and 
curing temperature should be precisely controlled. These 
features in adhesive binding process would increase the 
manufacturing cost in the electronic packaging. Therefore, a 
direct bonding process for the assembly of chips and flex 
substrates is required. In general, there are three categories of 
bonding process have been used in direct assembly of silicon 
chips and rigid substrates, thermal compression bonding, 
ultrasonic bonding and thermosonic bonding, respectively. 
The major bonding energy of thermal compression bonding 
process was thermal energy and bonding load. Nave et. al [6] 
has point out that the bonding parameters of silicon device 
flip-bonding on the ceramic substrates using the thermal 
compression bonding process were 0.5 N in bonding load for 
each bump and 300°C in bonding temperature. At this 
elevated bonding temperature, the thermal stress would be 
formed at bonding interface and the electronic device could 
be damaged. The ultrasonic power is the major energy source 
of the ultrasonic bonding process. The bonding quality is 
highly depended on the ultrasonic power. Too small 
ultrasonic power is insufficient to produce good bonding 
quality between chips and substrates. A crating could be 
formed underneath the bond pads when an excessive 
ultrasonic power was applied to assemble the chips and 
substrates. Therefore, the ultrasonic power should be 
controlled in the moderate range in the ultrasonic bonding 
process. The thermosonic bonding process combines two 
energy sources, ultrasonic power and thermal energy. This 
bonding process is a matured process for the assembly of 
chips and rigid substrates. However, the thermosonic bonding 
process is difficult to be applied to the assembly of chips and 
flex substrates directly since the dynamic sinking occurred at

As increase the ultrasonic power to 4.4 W, the bondability 
of chips they were thermosonically bonded to copper 
electrodes without nickel layer only approximately 30%. Most 
of chips cannot be bonded on the copper electrodes, and the 
bonding marks with limited scrapes left on the surface of 
copper electrodes over the flex substrates, as shown in Fig. 
2(a). It well known the scraping traces on the surface of 
copper electrodes over the flex substrates was made by the 
vibration of ultrasonic power during thermosonic bonding 
process. Therefore, the bonding marks with the limited 
scraping traces imply that the ultrasonic power at the bonding 
interface between the gold bumps and the copper electrodes 
was not sufficient to form the sound bonds. The low 
ultrasonic power of 4.4 W results in a poor bondability of 
chips they were thermosonically bonding to copper electrodes 
without depositing the nickel layer. In contrast to a poor 
bondabilty of chips and copper electrodes without depositing 
the nickel layer they were assembled using a low ultrasonic 
power of 4.4 W, 100% bondability can be achieved using a 
low ultrasonic power of 4.4 W for the assembly of the chips 
and copper electrodes depositing with a 0.5μm-thick nickel 
layer over the flex substrates. All tested chips were 
successfully bonded on the copper electrodes depositing with 
the nickel layer over the flex substrates as shown in Fig. 2(b). 
The nickel layer deposited on the copper electrodes was 
effective in improving bondability of chips they were 
thermosonically bonding to copper electrodes over the flex 
substrates at low ultrasonic power. In authors’ previous study 
has been verified that the rigidity of a copper electrode over 
the flex substrate can be strengthen by depositing a nickel 
layer on its surface and this nickel layer improved the 
bondability of a gold ball it was thermosoniclly bonding to 
the copper electrode over the flex substrate [3]. The nickel 
layer could enhance the propagation of the ultrasonic power 
from chips to the bonding interface, and the bondability was 
thus improved. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the ultrasonic power was varied from 14.46 W to 
27.56 W, the bondability of the assembly of chips and flex 
substrates maintained at 100%, implying all the chips were 
successfully bonded on the both test specimen, copper 
electrodes without depositing the nickel layer and copper 
electrodes depositing with the nickel layer. Increasing the 
ultrasonic power provides the sufficient bonding energy at 
bonding interface, and the perfect bondability can be obtained. 
However, the bondability of chips they were thermosonically 
bonding to copper electrodes without the nickel layer reduced 
to 80% when the applied ultrasonic power increased to 36.22 
W. An excessive ultrasonic power applied to copper 
electrodes without depositing the nickel layer could not be 
formed a firm contact between the gold bumps and the copper 
electrodes, and then the ultrasonic power could hard to 
propagate to the bonding interface during the thermosonic 
flip-chip bonding process. The bondability is thus degraded. 
One hundred percent bondability was shown in Fig. 1 for 
chips they were thermosonically bonding to copper electrodes 
with depositing the nickel layer at high ultrasonic power of 
36.22 W. Depositing a nickel layer on the copper electrode 
improved the elastic modulus. The elastic modulus increased 
with the thickness of the nickel layer from 68.7 GPa with no 
such layer to 108 GPa when a 0.5μm-thick nickel layer was 
deposited on the copper electrode [3]. Therefore, the 0.5μm-
thick nickel layer deposited on the copper electrodes over the 
flex substrates could enhance the rigid contact between the 
gold bumps and copper electrodes for a high ultrasonic power 
of 36.22 W applied to bonding process, and the perfect 
bondability can be maintained.  
Deposition of the 0.5μm-thick nickel layer on the copper 
electrodes over the flex substrates is an effective way to 
improve the bondability of the assembly of chips and flex 
substrates. Based on the experimental results, two advantages 
can be obtained as follows; the first is that the nickel layer 
enhances the propagation of the ultrasonic power to the 
bonding interface for a low ultrasonic power of 4.4 W was 
applied to bonding process. The other is that the nickel layer 
could improve the rigidity of copper electrodes over the flex 
substrates and could provide a firm contact between the gold 
bump and the copper electrode for a high ultrasonic power of 
36.22 W was applied to the thermosonic bonding process.  
To examine the influence of the ultrasonic power on the 
die-shear force, each chip with eight gold studded bumps was 
thermosonically flipped-bonding to flex substrates at different 
ultrasonic powers. The thermosonic bonding parameters were 
625 gf in bonding force, 0.5 s in bonding time, 200°C in 
bonding temperature and the ultrasonic power varied from 0 
W to 36.22 W. Figure 3 presents that the die-shear force of 
chips they were thermosonically bonding to copper electrodes 
with the nickel layer and to copper electrodes without 
depositing the nickel layer increases with the ultrasonic power 
form 0 to 20.66 W, and then decreases with the ultrasonic 
power is further increased from 27.56 to 36.22 W. The 
bondability of the assembly of chips and flex substrates is 
zero when the applied ultrasonic power was 0 W, no die-shear 
force can be thus obtained. It is well known that the minimum 
required die-shear force stated at JEDEC standards is highly 
depended on the contact area at bonding interface between the 
bumps and the copper electrodes. In this study, the average 
contact diameter of the bonded bumps at different ultrasonic 
power was measured using SEM as shown in Fig. 4. At low 
ultrasonic power of 4.4 W, the average contact diameters of 
bonded bumps after chips they were thermosonically bonded 
on copper electrodes with the nickel layer and on copper 
electrodes without the nickel layer were approximately 75μm

 ultrasonic power of 36.2 W as shown in Figs. 6(a) and (b). 
This experimental result indicates that bonding power was 
excessive and the bonding load seemed insufficient to keep a 
firm contact between the gold bumps and the copper

As increase the bonding load to 925 gf, the sound bonding 
interface can be achieved at ultrasonic power of 36.22 W after 
chips they were thermosonically bonded on copper electrodes 
with the nickel layer and on the copper electrodes without the 
nickel layer as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. These 
observations can be used to interpret why the degradation of 
die-shear force at the range of the ultrasonic powers from 
27.56W to 36.22 W, as shown in Fig. 3. The bonding energy 
of the ultrasonic power at the range of 27.56W to 36.22 W 
was excessive and the bonding force at 625 gf was 
insufficient to maintain a firm contact between the gold 
bumps and the copper electrodes. The ultrasonic power could 
not be transferred to the bonding interface to produce a sound 
bond with the sufficient die-shear force. This experimental 
result indicates that increasing bonding load appropriately is 
essential when a large ultrasonic power was applied to 
thermosonic bonding process. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects of bonding time on the die-shear force 
The SEM was used to examine the bonding interface 
between the gold bumps and the copper electrodes for the 
assembly of chips and flex substrates at ultrasonic power of 
20.66 W, as shown in Fig. 9(a). A large magnification of the 
SEM micrograph shown in Fig. 9(b) displays that a slight 
delamination can be found at the interface between the bond 
pad of chips and gold bumps after chips they were 
thermosonically bonded on copper electrodes with the nickel 
layer. This delamination could decrease the service life of 
chips. A short bonding time of 0.3 s was thus choice to be 
applied to the thermosonic bonding process. A die-shear force 
of the assembly of chips and flex substrates was 
approximately 600 gf and the average contacted diameter of 
gold bumps was 102 um at bonding time of 0.3 s. The 
minimum requirement stated in JEDEC standard is 
approximately 466 gf when the contacted diameter was 102 
um. This die-shear force is higher than those stated in the 
JEDEC standard. Neither the delamination nor defects was 
found at bonding interface of the assembly of chips and flex 
substrates at bonding time of 0.3 s shown in Figs. 10(a) and 
(b). This observation indicates that a sound bond without 
defects can be achieved by reducing the bonding time. This 
phenomenon can be explained by the interfacial energy

 at ultrasonic power of 4.4 W. As increasing ultrasonic power 
to 20.66 W or 27.56 W, the deposited layers on the copper 
electrodes were pulled out to form caves as shown in Figs. 
13(b) and (c), indicating the bonding strength between the 
gold bump and the copper electrode is higher than the 
adhesive strength between deposited layers of the copper 
electrode. This experimental result reveals again that high 
ultrasonic powers resulted in high die-shear forces of the 
assembly of chips they were thermosonically bonded to 
copper electrodes with the nickel layer, as mention in Fig. 3.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In contrast to a round indention left on the surface 
morphology of copper electrodes for chips they were 
thermosonically bonded on the copper electrodes with 
depositing the nickel layer, neither scratches nor clear round 
indention was observed on the surface morphology of copper 
electrodes for chips they were thermosonically bonded on 
copper electrodes without depositing the nickel layer at 
various ultrasonic powers, as shown in Figs. 14(a), (b) and (c). 
It well known that high ultrasonic power results more 
scratches forming at bonding interface. Thus, more ultrasonic 
power was propagated to bonding interface for chips they 
were thermosonically bonded to copper electrodes with 
depositing the nickel layer. Deposition of the 0.5μm-thick 
nickel layer on the copper electrodes over the flex substrates 
are effective in improving the transmission of ultrasonic 
power to bonding interface, and the die-shear force of 
assembly of chips and flex substrates was enhanced. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
Deposition of the 0.5 μm-thick nickel layer on the copper 
electrodes over the flex substrates, the chips were successfully 
thermosonically bonded on the copper electrodes over the flex 
substrates. With the suitable bonding parameters, a perfect 
bondability and a high die-shear force of the assembly of 
chips and flex substrates can be achieved. This nickel layer 
was effective to enhance rigidity of copper electrodes, 
increasing the bonding efficiency of ultrasonic power at 
bonding interface between the gold bumps and copper 
electrodes during the thermosonically flip-chip bonded 
process. The bonding quality of the assembly of chips and 
flex substrates are thus improved. In this study, the adequate 
bonding parameters of the assembly of chips they were 
thermosonically bonded to the flex substrates were an 
ultrasonic power of 20.66 W, a bonding force of 625 gf, a 
bonding time of 0.3 s and a bonding temperature of 200°C. 
As a large ultrasonic power was applied to the 
thermosonic bonding process, increasing bonding load is 
essential to make a firm contact between the gold bump and 
the copper electrode, and the ultrasonic power can be 
transferred successfully to the bonding interface between the 
gold bumps and the copper electrodess. The die-shear force is 
thus enhanced. Extending bonding time results a delamination 
forming at bonding interface, because an excessive bonding 
energy was provided. To obtain a sound bond with the 
sufficient bonding strength, the thermosonic bonding 
parameters should be controlled in a suitable range. 
According to the observation of the surface morphology of 
copper electrodes after chips they were separating from the
