摘要 
加速試驗是收集產品壽命資訊的一種方法，由於加速試驗需花費較長的時間和較高的成
本來收集資料，所以需要一套有效率的實驗規劃方法，來降低試驗的時間與成本。反應
曲面法是一種實驗設計方法，每個實驗變數僅需要兩個水準即可收集到足夠的實驗數
據，若將反應曲面法應用到加速試驗中便能有效的節省實驗次數與實驗時間。過去所採
用的壽命-應力模式多忽略應力之間的交互作用關係，在實務上，大多數的環境應力彼
此都會存在著交互作用，而反應曲面法的應用可以探討環境應力之間的交互作用。許多
的電子產品的壽命均服從韋伯分配與對數常態分配，因此，本研究以反應曲面法之中央
合成設計(Central Composite Design,CCD)與D-Optimal設計建構多重應力的加速試驗
計畫，並假設產品壽命符合韋伯分配與對數常態分配，以反應曲面迴歸式做為壽命-應
力模型，並與機率分配結合，以最大概似估計法建立參數估計式，並計算出各參數的估
計值，藉由迴歸模式與壽命分配來評估該產品可靠度與使用壽命等資訊。

Abstract 
Accelerated life testing (ALT) is an important approach to collect the lifetime data of 
products. To carry out ALT always requires longer testing time and expends higher 
cost. A faultless testing plan can reduce the time and cost. Response surface 
methodology (RSM) which is one kind of design of experiment always uses two-level 
factorial designs to collect the observations efficiently. Applied RSM to plan ALT can 
reduce the testing time and cost. In the past literatures of ALT, the life-stress 
relationship models always disregarded the influence of stress interaction terms on 
lifetime. In fact, stress interaction terms may heavily influence the lifetime of 
products, and the application of RSM can analyzes this influence. Lifetime of 
electronic products always follows the Weibull distribution or the Log-normal 
distribution. In this proposal, RSM Central Composite Design (CCD) and D-Optimal 
criterion will be applied to plan the multiple-stress ALT. RSM polynomial regression 
model will be used to fit the life-stress relationship model, and assumed the lifetime 
distribution of electronic products is respectively a Weibull distribution and a 
Log-normal distribution to develop the parametric estimators with maximum 
likelihood estimation method (MLE). Since the RSM polynomial regression model 
and lifetime distribution applications can infer the reliability and lifetime information 
of products.

壽命參數與環境應力會具有壽命-應力模式之關係，Nelson（1990）曾經談到將 
壽命-應力模式與機率分配結合，來評估各應力條件下的可靠度值，若採用反應 
曲面法來規劃加速試驗，則可以用一階具有交互作用項的迴歸模型來建立壽命- 
應力模式。 
  
 將一階具有交互作用項的迴歸模型 21322110 xxbxbxbb +++=η 分別代入 Weibull 與

Unlike the case of the single stress ALT, little work has been done on designing 
multiple-stresses accelerated life testing plans. Escobar and Meeker (1995) develop 
statistically optimal and practical plans with two stresses with no interaction between 
them. Park and Yum (1996) develop ALT plans in which two stresses are employed 
with possible interaction between them. The lifetime distribution of test units is 
assumed to be exponential. Elsayed and Zhang (2007) design two-stress ALT plans 
based on the proportional hazards (PH) model. No assumptions about the failure time 
distribution of the test units are made and the plans are optimized such that the 
variance of the reliability prediction is minimized. Guo and Pan (2007) formulate the 
D-optimal design for two-stress ALTs with Lognormal failure time distribution. 
 
In this study, we develop the RSM-based life-stress models for multiple-stresses ALT 
by assuming a linear relationship between the life (response) and the stresses (design 
factors). The lifetime distribution of test units is assumed to be either a Weibull 
distribution or a Lognormal distribution. The model parameters are estimated by the 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) technique. In the following sections, the 
approaches of life-stress model development and the parameters estimation are 
introduced. An example with simulation of right-censored failure data is also given. 
 
ACCELERATED LIFE MODEL AND PARAMETERE ESTIMATION 
 
In an effective quantitative accelerated life test, the practitioner chooses one or more 
stress types that cause the product to fail under normal use conditions. Stress types 
can include temperature, voltage, humidity, vibration or any other stress that directly 
affects the life of the product. For example, if a product normally operates at 290K 
and high temperatures cause the product to fail more quickly, then the accelerated life 
test for the product may involve testing the product at 310K, 320K and 330K in order 
to stimulate the units under test to fail more quickly. 
 
 
 
Accelerated life model 
 
Using the life data obtained at each accelerated stress level, we can use standard life 
data analysis techniques to estimate the parameters for the lifetime distribution that 
best fits the data at each stress level (e.g. Weibull or Lognormal). This results in an 
overstress failure density function for each accelerated stress level. Another

      (3) 
The scale parameter (or characteristic life) of the Weibull distribution is η. The 
Arrhenius-Weibull model pdf can then be obtained by setting η = L(V) in Eq. (4). 
       (4) 
and substituting for η in Eq. (3), 
   (5) 
RSM-based life-stress models 
 
RSM is a powerful technique for testing multiple process variables because fewer 
experimental trials are needed compared to the study of one variable at a time. Also, 
interactions between variables can be identified and quantified by such a technique.  
 
The prediction equation for a two-factor linear main effect model with interaction 
takes the form 
 
21322110 xxbxbxbby +++=      (6) 
 
where y is the response, b0 is the y-axis intercept, and (b1, b2, b3) are the coefficients 
of the factors. These model parameters can be estimated by the Maximum Likelihood 
Estimation (MLE) technique. 
 
To develop the life-stress model for the Weibull distribution (ARL-Weibull model), 
we set 21322110 xxbxbxbb +++=η  and substitute for η in Eq. (3) to get Eq. (7). The 
similar approach can be applied to derive the life-stress model for the Lognormal 
distribution (ARL-Lognormal model). By setting 21322110 xxbxbxbbtmedian +++=  and 
substituting it into the pdf of Lognormal distribution, we will be able to get Eq. (8).

The life time of an electronic part is assumed to be affected by both temperature and 
humidity.  A 22 full factorial design is applied on the ALTs to test system reliability 
of this product.  The temperature stress is set at either a high level of 398K or at a 
low level of 375K.  The humidity stress is set at either a high level of 0.8% or at a 
low level of 0.4%. The design matrix with failure data is given as Table 1. The

design team needs to listen to the Voice of the Customer 
(VOC). The VOC should represent the customer needs and is 
expressed in customer words. Usually, it is determined 
through personal interviews and/or focus groups. Based on the 
customer needs requirements are identified. After 
identification of requirements, a quantitative marketing 
research is conducted to evaluate the competitive position of 
the product in the market in terms of customer satisfaction and 
the importance given by customers to each requirement. Based 
on the competitive analysis, a target for customer satisfaction 
is set for each requirement. 
 
The final relative weight of the requirements is then 
calculated [4, 11] (Fig. 1). Thereafter, a set of design attributes 
that could fulfill the customer requirements is determined. 
Further, customer requirements and design attributes are 
correlated in a matrix called House of Quality, translating the 
voice of the customer into product specifications. 
 
 
Figure 1. House of quality [3] 
3. Kano’s model 
The customer is usually not able to accurately specify the 
desired product attributes in the real buying situation. With a 
simple questionnaire, only the tip of the iceberg and not the 
real needs of the customer are often identified [7]. Therefore, 
methodical support is necessary to clearly identify the relevant 
customer requirements. One method capable of identifying the 
core of the customer requirements is the Kano method. Kano 
introduced the theory of attractive quality. Based on 
theoretical foundations a two-dimensional model of quality 
attributes was presented. Further, a method was illustrated to 
use this theory in practice [5]. 
 
The theory of attractive quality proposes five dimensions 
of perceived quality (i.e., attractive, one-dimensional, must-be, 
indifferent and reverse quality). As shown in Figure 2, it 
evaluates these dimensions on the basis of the relationship 
between degree of fulfillment of a quality attribute and 
customer satisfaction with the quality attribute. For the last 
two decades, this theory is receiving attention of researchers 
and practitioners in strategic thinking, business planning, and 
product development to provide guidance with respect to 
innovation, competitiveness, and product compliance [6]. 
 
The different quality elements of the theory of attractive 
quality are as follows [5, 7, 9, 11]: 
 
1. Must-be requirements (M): must-be requirements are a 
decisive competitive factor, and if they are not fulfilled, the 
customer will be extremely dissatisfied and will not be 
interested in the product at all. On the other hand, as the 
customer takes these requirements for granted, their 
fulfillment will not increase satisfaction level significantly. 
2. One-dimensional requirements (O): in this category of 
requirements, customer satisfaction is proportional to the 
level of fulfillment of need— the higher the level of 
fulfillment, the higher the customer’s satisfaction and vice 
versa. One-dimensional requirements are usually explicitly 
demanded by the customer. 
3. Attractive requirements (A): these requirements are the 
product criteria having the greatest influence on how 
satisfied a customer will be with a given product. 
Attractive requirements are neither explicitly expressed nor 
expected by the customer. Fulfilling these requirements 
may lead to more than proportional satisfaction. However, 
there is no feeling of dissatisfaction if they are not met. 
4. Indifferent requirements (I): this category means that the 
customer is not much interested in it, whether it is present 
or not. 
5. Reverse requirements (R): this means that, not only do the 
customers not desire that product attribute, but they also 
expect the reverse of it. 
 
Figure 2. Kano’s model (Berger et al.,1993) [2] 
 
By using the Kano model and integrating it in the QFD the 
design team can enhance the understanding of customer needs, 
leading to superior product design. Researchers have shown 
keen interest to somehow reflect the understandings and 
results of the Kano model into QFD planning matrix, i.e., 
House of Quality. Kano model can be more accurately 
integrated into QFD for deciding the importance rating and 
prioritizing customer requirements so that a product or service 
can satisfy a customer more prominently and a competent 
product can be made available to the market. 
 
From Table 1, there are nine Must-be requirements which 
are Speaker, Touch Panel, Barcode Scanner, Bluetooth, 
Keypad, IrDA, LCD, USB Transmission, and Battery. Both 
Vibrator and SD Card are Indifferent requirements. WLAN is 
an One-dimensional requirement and Rugged design is an 
Attractive requirement. Both Battery and Rugged design have 
the highest values of adjusted improvement ratio and adjusted 
importance.
 
Table 1. Final importance of requirements with Chaudha’s approach 
 
6. Conclusion 
The traditional QFD approach uses importance ratings and 
customer satisfaction with the company’s product and its 
competitors to establish priorities among customer 
requirements and deploy them in the design process. After 
identifying unexpected and unspoken features, which can be 
attractive to the customer, the Kano model of customer 
satisfaction can be successfully integrated to prioritize 
customer importance with the calculation of its adjusted 
improvement ratio. 
The integration of the Kano model with QFD provides a 
mean for organizations to delight customers by including their 
voice into the product design process. The application of the 
Kano model is useful for better discrimination of customer 
needs whereas its integration in QFD matrix will help product 
designers to decide most important product development 
activities and to achieve maximum customer satisfaction. 
Results from the case example can provide useful 
information to the design of EDAs. By focusing on the 
important attributes, design of an EDA can better meet real 
customer requirements.
