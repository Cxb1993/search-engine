Introduction
Electric arc furnace (EAF) flue dust is generated during EAF steelmaking from
iron-containing scrap such as recycled automobile bodies. It is estimated that about 20 to 30 Kg
of EAF dust are generated per ton of steel produced. The growth of EAF steelmaking indicates
an increasing recycle of steel scrap and has obvious economic and resource conservation benefits.
As a result of these developments there has been an increasing volume of EAF dust to be handled.
At present Taiwan produces 2.8 million tons of EAF dust per year. The EAF dust is considered
as a hazardous waste in most countries because it fails the toxicity characteristic leaching
procedure (TCLP) test for Pb, Cd and Cr. However, the relatively high level of Zn in EAF dusts
provides a potentially valuable resource, even though the zinc is present as oxide phases such as
zincite (ZnO) and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4). Usually EAF dusts contain an average of 20-30% of
Zn in weight with a proportion of 50% in the zinc ferrite form. At present most options
developed to recover Zn and possibly other metals from EAF dusts were concerned with
pyrometallurgical and/or hydrometallurgical routes. Zn in zincite form can be recovered
without too many difficulties for both pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes. But
recovery of Zn in ferrite is considerably complex and difficult due to that ferrite is very stable and
the ferrite must be decomposed before the Zn in ferrite can be recovered. In other words
operating conditions for Zn recovery from zincite and ferrite differ significantly. Thus it seems
to be advantage to separate zincite (ZnO) and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) particles in EAF dusts with a
relatively simple process before a pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical Zn recovery process.
It was found that the finest particles in EAF dust, whose sizes are lower than 2 or 3 um, are
frequently agglomerated to each other or around a bigger particle. Sofilic et al. shown that EAF
dusts were composed of solid spherical agglomerates with Fe, Zn, Pb, and O as the principal
element. After analyzing EAF dusts collected from 13 steelmaking plants in Taiwan, Lee and
Tsai found that EAF dust exists as irregular agglomerates from 3 to 20 um in size and are made
up of much smaller round particles from 0.3 to 1 um in size. The agglutinative substance was
identified as being ZnCl2．4Zn(OH)2．H2O. Evidently, a method is needed to effectively liberate
ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles from agglomerates and maintain a stable suspension amenable to the
subsequent separation of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles. In this work, a method to liberate and
disperse ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles in aqueous suspensions of EAF dust was developed and the
efficiency of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles separated by classification was evaluated.
Experimental
Materials
EAF dust sample used in this study was obtained from dust containers located at the bottom
of baghouses in a steelmaking plant at southern Taiwan. The dust sample was pre-wash with
distilled water to remove dissolvable salts. Five analytical grad deflocculants, citric acid
(C6H8O7) (3COOH+1OH), sodium citrate (C6H8O7), oxalic acid (C2O4H2) (2COOH),
hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA-Na4, Na4C10H12N2O6) obtained
from Merck were used in this study.
Fig.1 The X-ray diffraction pattern of the pre-washed EAF dust
Selected SEM images of EAF dust are given in Fig 2a and 3a. The dusts comprise small and large
particles of various shapes but with dominant larger spherical particles. Many small particles
appear to be stuck or fused to large spherical particles. The results of X-ray energy dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) on selected particles (enclosed by a square in SEM images) are shown in Fig.
2b and 3b. Fig 2b shows that the major element of spherical particles is Fe (84.56%). In
contrast, Fig 3b indicates that the major element of small irregular particles is Zn (63.68%).
Combining information obtained from Figs. 1, 2 and 3, it is reasonable to identify the EAF dusts
as agglomerates of small irregular ZnO particles stuck or fused to large ZnFe2O4 spherical
particles. The fine nature of ZnO grains relative to the coarser ZnFe2O4 particles is consistent
with the test results discussed latter. Fig.4 demonstrates the hydrodynamic particle size
distribution of raw EAF dust (dust without citric acid in Fig. 4) determined by the Andreasen
pipette method. The fact that most of particles in raw EAF dusts are coarse than 10 um
indicates raw EAF dusts are highly agglomerated and an effective dispersing method is needed to
liberate and disperse ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles in aqueous suspension. Results of HCl
leaching tests (Fig.5) shown that leaching curve for both Zn and Fe demonstrated a break-point at
0.3 N HCl which indicated the onset of zinc ferrite dissolution. Thus the amount of Zn leached
out corresponding to 0.3 N HCl is a good estimation of Zn in zincite form. It is estimated that
about 50.7% of Zn in this dust is in the zinc ferrite form. This means that a complete separation
of zincite (ZnO) and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) particles will result in a 49.3% recovery of Zn in dust.

The deflocculation efficiency and concentration of Zn dissolved out for EAF dust
suspensions as a function of deflocculant dosage for various defocculants are shown in Fig. 6.
The dosages of deflocculant applied are expressed in mmol of deflocculant per gram of dust
(mmol / g of dust). In here we are seeking for a deflocculant to effectively dissolve the
agglutinative substance binding ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles together and consequently disperse
EAF dust suspensions. It is clear that citric acid and Na-citrate, both a tetradendate chelating
agent, demonstrated the best deflocculation efficiency among defocculants tested (Fig. 6a and 6b).
Dosage of 0.06 mmol/g of dust citric acid and 0.16 mmol/g of dust Na-citrate resulted in a
deflocculation efficiency of 24% and 33% respectively for EAF dust suspension. In addition the
amount of Zn ion released was 5 ppm and 1.1 ppm respectively at those deflocculant dosages. It
is noted that in the absence of deflocculant, EAF dust suspension is fully agglomerated (0%
deflocculation efficiency). Fig. 6 also indicated that Fe ions released for all deflocculation tests
were neglectable in contrast to Zn ions. This implies that Zn containing species such as ZnCl2．
4Zn(OH)2．H2O are responsible for the agglomeration of EAF dusts. It is seen from Fig. 6(a)
that deflocculation efficiency increases dramatically with the addition of citric acid, with constant
deflocculation efficiency being maintained at 0.06 mmol/g of dust dosage of citric acid or higher
even though the amount of Zn ion released is continuous to increase. Thus, it is reasonable to
speculate that dust suspension will be disperse once the agglutinative substance (such as ZnCl2．
4Zn(OH)2．H2O) binding ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles together (5ppm Zn in solution) having been
dissolved at 0.06 mmol/g of dust dosage of citric acid. Further increase of citric acid dosage
resulted only in more Zn ions released probably due to the decrease of solution pH (Fig. 7). For
the deflocculation of dust suspensions by Na-citrate (Fig 6b), the deflocculation efficiency was
found to increase with increasing Na-citrate dosage. However the amount of Zn ion released is
quit low (0 ppm –1.2 ppm) comparing to deflocculation using citric acid. Because of the
relatively high pH conditions result from using Na-citrate (Fig. 7), we speculate that Na-citrate is
a weak base which releases Zn ions mainly by forming Zn-citrate complexes in solution. The
effect of citric acid on the liberation and dispersion of EAF dust was further support by the
hydrodynamic particle size distribution of EAF dust after citric acid addition (Fig. 4). The
average particle size (d50) of dust decreased from 20 um to 3 um with a 0.06 mmol/g of dust citric
acid addition. However double the citric dosage did not further decrease particle size of dust
and this result was in line with result from deflocculation test (Fig 6a). It is also interesting to

Classification test
The effect of deflocculation on subsequent classification of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 particles in
aqueous suspensions of EAF dust was evaluated by a sedimentation test adapted from the
Andreasen pipette method using citric acid at a dosage of 0.16 mmol/g of dust. Table 1 showed
the mass and Zn, Fe content of solids collected from a settling suspension of EAF dusts at
specified times each corresponding to a certain settling velocity. Thus each sample of solid
represents a portion of EAF dust that be elutriated by an upward flowing fluid with a rising
velocity equal to the settling velocity. The parameters used to evaluate the separation are
percent Zn recovery and Zn grad of collected dust. Fig. 8 plot dust recovery, Zn recovery and
Zn grad of overflow products as a function of elutriation velocity during classification. It is
noted that the dust recovery curve was relatively parallel to the Zn recovery curve presumably
due to that only 49.3% of Zn in zincite (ZnO) form was recoverable by classification. This
means that a complete separation of zincite (ZnO) and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) particles will result
in a 49.3% recovery of Zn in dust. However elutriating at 0.01 (cm/min) fluid velocity we could
recover 30% of Zn at a grad of 70% Zn and 10% dust recovery from well liberated and dispersed
suspension of EAF dust. This high-grad zincite concentrate may be reused directly and the 90%
underflow product may require further treatment to separate Zn and Fe.
