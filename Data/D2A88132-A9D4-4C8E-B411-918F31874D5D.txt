2 The Stochastic System Description 
Consider a stochastic system as depicted in Figure 1 where 
u(k) and y(k) denote observations of inputs and outputs in 
discrete time, v(k) represents the stochastic disturbance (or 
noise), d is the integer number of pure time delay, and G(q) 
is the process transfer function. The system can be 
described by the following difference equation:

where 1−q  is the backward shift operator and An  and Bn  
denote the orders of the polynomials, A(q) and B(q), 
respectively.  
With the orders and the delay given, the SLS method has 
been developed to estimate the model parameters ia  and 
ib  based on observations of inputs and outputs. However, 
the method stipulates that the noise should be described by 
an AR model structure:

where e(k) is a realization of a white-noise process.

The above LSE is unbiased and consistent because the 
sequence indicated in Eq. (3) is zero-mean and independent. 
On the other hand, a large number of noise characteristics 
do not fall into the category of (2). As a result, the SLS 
method would generally lead to biased parameter estimates. 
The GLS and IV4 methods were proposed to deal with such 
situations. Both methods assume explicitly or implicitly a 
more complicated AR noise model as

On the basis of postulation (7), the GLS and IV4 methods 
resolve partially the stochastic identification difficulty that 
the noise characteristics may vary widely in practice. 
However, our thorough investigation has revealed that the 
two methods could be neither unbiased nor efficient if the 
actual dynamics of noise v(k) consist of significant zeros or 
are much faster than the process dynamics (e.g. 
measurement noises). Both conditions imply that the noise 
dynamics cannot be adequately described by Eq. (7). 
3 EWMA Parameter Estimators 
To make an improvement over the GLS and IV4 methods 
in the face of multifarious noise characteristics, we 
introduce the EWMA as 
)()1()1()( kykk λζλζ +−−=  (9) 
where 10 ≤< λ  is the weighting constant and the starting 
value ( 0k  is an arbitrarily assigned starting instant) is 
0)( 0 =kζ  
The EWMA )(kζ  is a weighted average of all past and 
current output observations. The value of λ dictates the 
weight assigned to the current observation y(k). 
Substituting Eq. (1) into the y(k) term in Eq. (9) and 
ignoring the effect of noise v(k) could arrive at a linear 
regression equation:

(16) with y, u, and w replaced by Fy , Fu , and Fw , 
respectively. 
The proposed off-line algorithm entails repeated use of the 
preceding four-step procedure to find the optimal λ value 
that minimizes the error criterion (20), thus giving the best 
final estimates of model parameters aˆi , bˆi , and cˆi . These 
parameter estimates constitute an ARARX model of Eq. (8). 
Note that with the assumption of the ARARX structure, the 
noise of unknown dynamics is approximated by a 
high-order AR structure (7). The efficiency of such an 
approximation has been discussed by Wahlberg [7].  
To convert the identified ARARX model to an ARMAX or 
BJ model, we employ the relative error balanced model 
reduction (REBMR) technique presented by Wahlberg [7] 
to estimate the ARMA part of the ARMAX or BJ model as 
follows: 
Step 1. Calculate the output error OE(k) defined in Eq. (17), 
which represents the noise v(k). The prefilter F(q) 
estimated by Eq. (19) constitutes an alternative high-order 
AR disturbance estimate:

Step 2. Find the ARMA disturbance model (H(q)/D(q)) by 
applying the REBMR technique to the above AR estimate. 
6 Model-Based Monitoring and Control 
The standard assumptions for most conventional control 
charts used in process monitoring are that the process 
(noise) data when it is in statistical control are normally and 
independently distributed [8]. Both the mean and standard 
deviation are considered fixed and unknown. An 
out-of-control condition is a change or shift in the mean (or 
standard deviation) to some different value. Unfortunately, 
the dynamic feature of Eq. (23) implies that the process 
data tend to be autocorrelated over time, causing the 
conventional control charts to make too many false alarms. 
One can use the identified disturbance model to remove the 
autocorrelation from the noise data v(k) and apply control 
charts to the residuals or prediction errors as depicted in 
Figure 2. Suppose that Eq. (23) for the noise disturbance is 
available. The one-step-ahead prediction for the noise at 
time k made at time k − 1 is given by 
[ ] )()()()(ˆ1)(ˆ 1 kvqFkvqFkv pk =−=−  
The sequence of one-step-ahead prediction errors  
)(ˆ)()( 1 kvkvkx k −−=
is independently and identically distributed with mean zero. 
When the process is under automatic control, the noise 
observation data can be calculated by 
)()()( kykykv M−≈
where yM(k) is the predicted process outputs by passing the 
controller outputs u(k) through the identified process model 
)(ˆ qG .
The EWMA control chart has been frequently applied to 
monitor small-to-moderate shifts in the process mean [8]. 
The EWMA ϖ(k) for the prediction errors is defined as 
)1()1()()( −−+= kkxk ϖηηϖ  
The EWMA control chart is constructed by plotting ϖ(k) 
versus the sample number k (or time). Inasmuch as x(k) 
approximates an independent random sequence with mean 
zero and variance σ2, the upper and lower control limits are 
known as 
( )ηησ −+= 2LxUCL
( )ηησ −−= 2LxLCL
where the center line is the process target (or mean) x− and L

system gives rise to the discrete-time system employed by 
Ljung [4] for verifying the IV4 method. We employed this 
example to explore the joint effects of T (between 0.17 and 
5), N, and NSR supposing that the sampling period for e(k) 
was fixed at 0.17 and the experiment time Nt  was limited 
to 100. For each selected sampling period T for u(k) and 
y(k), 500 simulation runs were performed subject to the 
type II or type III disturbance. The variance of e(k) was 
adjusted so as to produce test data with NSR = 40% at T = 
0.17. Obviously, NSR would decrease with an increase in T. 
Note that N would also decrease with T as TN 100≈ . 
Application of the proposed algorithm with 2== BA nn , 
4== FC nn , d = 0 yields the identification results for 
different sampling periods, which are compared with the 
GLS and IV4 methods for the type II disturbance in Figures 
3(a) and 3(b) and for the type III disturbance in Figures 3(c) 
and 3(d). Note that the type II disturbance is close to the AR 
structure of (7). Hence, all the three methods obtain 
unbiased and efficient parameter estimates for T < 3 as 
expected. Nevertheless, the IV4 method is poorer in bias 
properties. The type III disturbance can be used to 
represent measurement noise and is considerably deviated 
from the AR structure of (7). The present algorithm is still 
the best because the resulting estimator remains unbiased 
and efficient for the widest range of the sampling period 
(0.17 < T < 4). Both the GLS and IV4 methods work well 
for a much narrower range of the sampling period. 
Next we apply the EWMA control charts [8] to the data 
samples from Example 2 subject to the type IV disturbance. 
A test run under proportional-integral control was 
performed to obtain the process model and the prefilter F(q) 
with nF = 6 using the off-line algorithm with T = 0.25, N = 
200, NSR = 50%, and λ = 0.1. A small T was chosen 
because of fast disturbance dynamics. Thereafter, the 
process was switched to the generalized minimum variance 
control at sample number zero and a process shift of 
moderate magnitude was introduced at sample number 100. 
The EWMA control chart (η = 0.1, L = 2.7) based on the 
prediction errors signals at sample number 110 as shown in 
Figure 4(a), so we would conclude correctly that the 
process is out of control. Figure 4(b) shows clearly that the 
two GMVC schemes with k1 = 0.1 outperform the system 
without control. 
8 Conclusion 
It has been demonstrated that the proposed EWMA 
identification method yields unbiased and efficient 
parameter estimates for a wide variety of process dynamics 
and noise characteristics. In particular, the method is very 
robust with respect to the noise level as well as choices of 
the sampling period. As a result, it can identify models 
suited to various monitoring and control techniques from 
limited process data acquisition. 
For process monitoring and control, the stochastic 
disturbance is described by an AR model, whereas the 
process shift is assumed to be a deterministic step change.
