Jet trenching and backfill monitoring of river sediment beds  
with an underwater ROV 
 
1. Objectives and achievements 
The overall research effort is aimed at developing a novel approach for the in situ 
characterization of underwater sediment beds. The approach is based on the deployment of a 
small-scale underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) equipped with jetting and imaging 
devices. To implement this approach, the project must address three challenges: 1) the 
development and testing of a vehicle suitable for river deployment; 2) the development of 
imaging techniques, to guide ROV navigation and measure the topography of the river bed; 3) 
quantitative understanding of the jetting process, to be achieved through computational 
modelling and laboratory experiments.  
 
Key achievements that were documented in the previous report include:  
1) The completion of the vehicle body and its tracked propulsion system, combined with 
modelling of the resulting vehicle behavior over uneven terrain. 
2) The development and testing of a laser-based strategy for simultaneous localization and 
mapping (SLAM) over uneven terrain. 
In this report, we document the following key achievements of the last year of the project: 
3) The comprehensive development and laboratory validation of a theoretical and numerical 
model of underwater jet trenching by plane jets. This is documented in detail by the first 
journal paper provided in appendix: 
Perng, A.T.H., and Capart, H. (2007) Underwater sand bed erosion and internal jump 
formation by travelling plane jets. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, in press. 
4) The extension of the approach to three-dimensional trenches created by point jets and more 
complex swords with multiple jets. Partial results from this effort were presented at the 32nd 
Congress of the International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research, in a paper 
that is also provided in appendix:

overspill due to moving point jets. Proceedings of the 32nd IAHR Congress, Venice, Italy,

Figure 1 shows the transverse plane jet configuration that we have investigated in order to 
better understand the erosional action of moving underwater jets (Perng and Capart, 2007). 
By choosing a plane jet and operating it within a parallel-walled flume, the flow can be made 
uniform in the transverse direction, and can be modelled using a one-dimensional shallow 
flow description, extended to account for erosion and entrainment.

bed close to a transparent flume wall, yielding a 3D trench shape and flow pattern. 
 
While such a simplification greatly facilitates analysis, it limits significantly the kind of 
phenomena that can be treated. When dealing with flows that are of interest in practice, their 
three-dimensional nature must be taken into consideration. The jetting configurations used in 
practice by actual jet trenching vehicles, in particular, are not so simple (Capart et al., 2006).

device is a thin needle fed mounted on a moving arm of adjustable orientation and fed with 
high-pressure water from an irrigation pump. 
 
A typical configuration allowing three-dimensional jet trenching flows to be observed both 
from the side and from the top is illustrated in Figure 4. In these experiments, the point-like 
jet moves at constant speed along the sand bed, eroding and suspending sand that deposits 
further away, backfilling the incised trench. Time-lapse images of a needle jet experiment, 
imaged from two different angles with the use of a mirror, are presented in Figure 5.

4. Shallow flow modeling with erosion and entrainment 
The modeling approach that we have developed for plane jets is a shallow flow description of 
underwater jet-induced currents. The description takes into account turbulent entrainment of 
ambient water as well as erosion and deposition of sand from the bed. The conceptual view 
adopted for this model is illustrated in Fig. 6.

and are based on conservation principles for mass and momentum, which must be 
complemented by energy considerations (Perng and Capart, 2007). Sample results from 1D 
computations are shown in Fig. 7 and compared with transverse plane experiments.

Challenges remain for the extension of such a modelling approach to three-dimensional jets. 
The corresponding mathematical and computational developments will have to be pursued in 
future work. Based on the experimental observations, however, a preliminary understanding 
of the dominant processes has been obtained, and is illustrated in Figure 8. These observations 
will help guide the choice of assumptions in future three-dimensional models.

bottom using ships or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs): (a) suction dredging, in which sand
is mined from the bed; (b) water injection dredging (after Knox et al. 1994), in which jetting

ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). The ‘product’, cable or pipeline, is ﬁrst simply laid
onto the sea bottom. The vehicle then uses two upright or oblique swords lowered on
both sides of the product to inject high-speed water into the sand bed. The jets scour
a temporary trench, travelling with the vehicle, which allows the cable or pipeline to
descend into the sea bed before being buried under the re-depositing sand further
downstream of the trencher. Similar tasks have also been carried out using the suction
hoppers of dredging ships (ﬁgure 1a), with the pumps operated in reverse to produce
jets instead of suction (van Melkebeek 2002).
Although extensive testing and operational experience has been accumulated for
jet trenching vehicles (see for instance Machin 2001), the ﬂow processes involved are
not yet well understood. Practical diﬃculties hindering such understanding include
operation in diﬃcult and turbid environments, as well as complicated patterns of
water and sand motions.

sublayered description in which the turbulent bottom current is assumed stratiﬁed into
sediment-laden and sediment-free sublayers. A generalization of the sharp interface
view adopted by Fraccarollo & Capart (2002) will then be used to treat erosion
and entrainment across the interfaces bounding these sublayers. Secondly, the steep
trenching fronts obtained near the point of impingement will motivate the adoption
of curvilinear coordinates. In similar contexts, such curvilinear coordinates have been
used in two recent works to describe turbulent entrainment by curved jets (Jirka 2006)
and basal erosion by shallow subaerial landslides (Chen, Crosta & Lee 2006). Finally,
we will transform the governing equations to moving coordinates in order to describe
the steady ﬂows observed after long travel times in a frame of reference attached to
the moving jets.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the laboratory experiments
performed to characterize jet trenching ﬂows. In § 3, we derive our proposed sublayered
shallow-ﬂow equations. Section 4 is devoted to the construction of special travelling-
wave solutions to these equations. The ﬂow and solution details that must be addressed
in order to compute long proﬁles of the bed and current are treated in § 5. Comparisons
between computations and measurements are presented in § 6. Finally, conclusions
are proposed in § 7.
2. Laboratory experiments
2.1. Experimental apparatus
To characterize the sand-bed response to the action of moving jets, small-scale
experiments were performed at the Hydrotech Research Institute of National
Taiwan University. The laboratory apparatus and procedure are shown in ﬁgure 2.
Experiments take place in a rectangular tank having the following dimensions:
length=180 cm; height= 50 cm; inner width B =12.6 cm. To obtain an unobstructed
view, each sidewall is formed of a single glass panel of area 180 cm× 50 cm, with
a thickness of 12mm chosen to minimize deformation. The bottom of the tank is
composed of an 18 cm thick layer of sand, submerged under a 29 cm deep clear-water
ambient. Before each experiment, a scraping plate is used to give the sand surface a
ﬂat horizontal proﬁle (dashed line in ﬁgure 2a). The level of the free surface of the
water is kept constant during jetting by way of a siphon overﬂow. Photographs of
the set-up are provided in Perng (2006).
The jetting device used to produce a plane jet is formed of three cylindrical jetting
heads of width=4.1 cm, placed side by side. Made of machined and welded copper,
each head is supplied with high-pressure water (through a ﬂexible polyurethane tube),
and discharges the water at high speeds into the tank through a row of 19 nozzles
of internal radius R=0.25 mm. The resulting individual round turbulent jets can be
expected to merge into a single uniform plane jet within distances of around 5 to
10 times the nozzle separation distance of 2mm (Jirka 2006). The speciﬁc momentum
ﬂux per unit width of the corresponding equivalent plane jet is given by
Σ =hv2 =
Q2
BNπR2
, (1)
where N =3× 19=57 is the number of nozzles, R their radius, B the channel width,
and Q the total discharge fed to the jetting heads. The choice of three aligned but
separate jetting heads is made to attain a more uniform spanwise distribution of
jetting strength. In earlier tests, we found that we could not achieve the desired degree
of uniformity with a single head spanning the entire tank width. The high-pressure

standoﬀ distance of the nozzles above the undisturbed bed was set to Z=5mm.
Three jetting discharges Q=90, 107 and 122ml s−1 were examined. This corresponds
to water velocities at the nozzles of 8.0, 9.6 and 10.9m s−1, respectively, and to
jetting strengths Σ1 = 5.8 l s
−2, Σ2 = 8.1 l s−2, and Σ3 = 10.6 l s−2. For each discharge,
tests were performed at various speeds of advance U . Further tests conducted with
another standoﬀ distance Z=10mm are described in Perng (2006).
2.2. Sand properties
The sand material used for the tests is a medium quartz sand of density
ρS =2670 kgm
−3, median diameter d50 = 0.33mm, and coeﬃcient of uniformity
d60/d10 = 2.0. The volumetric sand concentration in the static sedimented bed is
estimated to be in the range 0.58<n0 < 0.62. The settling of sand grains is known
to depend on the concentration of the suspension (Richardson & Zaki 1954; van
Rijn 1984). Measurements of fall speed and settling rates were therefore conducted
at various concentrations (ﬁgure 3). Fall speeds are measured by timing the fall
of individual sand grains between two horizontal lines, whereas settling rates are
measured using sedimentation column experiments (ﬁgure 3b). For each concentration
n, a known volume of sand is thoroughly mixed with water in a closed column, then
left to settle under the action of gravity. Assuming that both the bed surface and
turbid interface behave like kinematic shocks (see Ungarish 1993), their elevations z(0)
and z(1) will change at rates governed by
dz(0)

where w=w(n) is the settling rate at the given concentration. The settling process
leaves both the suspended sediment concentration n and the total sediment volume

(0) + nh1 unchanged. In the actual sedimentation column tests, only the bed
interface z(0) is suﬃciently sharp to be identiﬁed precisely. We therefore estimate
the settling rate w(n) from the formula

of sediment mass (neglecting variations in sedimented sand concentration before and
after trenching), the scour hole travelling to the left leaves behind a sand heap in
the start-up region, with equivalent positive and negative volumes on either side of
the initial horizontal bed proﬁle. The experiment ends as the jetting tool reaches the
opposite end of the tank, when both the carriage and pump are stopped.
The diﬀerent ﬂow patterns produced when varying the speed of advance of the
jetting tool relative to the sand bed are shown in ﬁgure 5. Our discussion here is
qualitative, but a phase diagram will be presented in § 6.2 to delineate these various
regimes in a more quantitative manner. To provide a point of reference, the ﬂow
observed when the jetting tool is held stationary is ﬁrst presented in ﬁgure 5(a). In
that case, sand eroded from the bed forms two triangular heaps on both sides of a
stationary scour hole, attaining a steady shape in less than 1min. Within this leveed
scour hole, a mixture of sand and water circulates counterclockwise around a spanwise
vortical axis. Clear water injected at high speed by the jetting head churns around then
discharges to the ambient by detraining at low speed across a boiling turbid interface
separating the turbulent suspension below from the clear water above. The observed
pattern is similar to that documented by Rajaratnam (1981) in his early stationary
plane-jet experiments. Unlike the threshold-of-motion conditions considered by Hogg
et al. (1997) and Gioia & Bombardelli (2005), here the bottom of the scour hole
attains a dynamic equilibrium in which turbulent entrainment of sand from the bed
is balanced by gravitational settling of sand grains out of suspension.
10 A. T. H. Perng and H. Capart
(2005), probably the best that could be expected from a simpliﬁed theory would be to
obtain basic scaling relations between the jetting strength and the dimensions of the
scour hole, to be compared with empirical scaling relations such as those obtained
by Rajaratnam (1981). Likewise, the complicated ﬂow pattern of ﬁgure 5(b), where
both breaching and ﬂow separation are observed, appears to lie beyond the reach
of a simple theory. The situation is more favourable, however, for the conditions
of ﬁgures 5(c) and 5(d), where the ﬂow appears suﬃciently well-behaved to permit
a hydraulic theory of the interaction between jet, ambient and sediment. In what
follows, we restrict our attention to these two regimes, which also correspond to the
conditions of practical interest in jet trenching applications.
2.4. Proﬁle measurements
As shown in ﬁgure 6(a), time-lapse photographs like those shown in ﬁgure 4 are used
to extract longitudinal ﬂow proﬁles. The photographs are taken using a low-distortion
wide-angle lens, capturing the entire tank length, and oriented with the image plane
parallel to the tank walls. Image acquisition is performed at the rate of one image
per second. To obtain quantitative measurements, proﬁles are extracted from these
images using manual mouse clicks, then converted to physical coordinates using a
calibrated scale factor and rotation adjustment. Coordinates in the travelling frame
of reference are obtained by measuring distances with respect to a moving origin
chosen as the position of the nozzle closest to the sidewall, projected vertically down
onto the initial sediment bed proﬁle.
As illustrated in ﬁgure 6(a), two proﬁles are extracted from each image. The ﬁrst is
the bed proﬁle (ﬁlled circles), separating the motionless sand deposit below from the
ﬂowing current above. As for the settling column tests, this boundary is rather sharp
and its visual identiﬁcation does not suﬀer from much ambiguity. The second proﬁle
extracted (open circles) is an upper boundary of the zone occupied by suspended
sediment. As seen in ﬁgures 4 and 6(a), this transition between sediment-laden and
sediment-free regions is reasonably sharp in some places, but rather diﬀuse in others,
leaving ample room for the subjectivity of the analyst. This second proﬁle should
therefore be taken as indicative only.
To gauge the rate of convergence of the trench proﬁle towards a steady shape in
the travelling frame of reference, the bed proﬁles corresponding to the time-lapse
images of ﬁgure 4 are plotted together in ﬁgure 6(b). For clarity, the proﬁles are
distorted vertically by a factor of 2, and plotted in the moving coordinates. They
are observed to converge rather rapidly towards a steady-state limit, the more so for
positions located closer to the jetting tool. Convergence is slowest for the far end of
the trench, where bed levels exceed the initial bed elevation as a result of the start-up
heap, which requires a signiﬁcant travel distance to be left behind. With the exception
of the distal tail, where proﬁles may not be fully converged, proﬁles captured near
the end of a run are thus checked to approximate an asymptotic steady shape, and
will be used in § 6 for quantitative comparisons with steady calculations.
2.5. Simple model and characteristic parameters
Before developing a more complete theory, it is useful to sketch a simple model
which explains how moving jets lead to the formation of a steady scour proﬁle in a
travelling frame of reference. Let z(0), h and u denote, respectively, the bed height,
current thickness and longitudinal current speed along the curved proﬁle of a shallow
12 A. T. H. Perng and H. Capart
speed of advance U from right to left), the proﬁle z(0)(x, t) reduces to z(0)(xˆ) where
xˆ = x + Ut. (6)
It follows that

dz(0)
dxˆ
=−Eu + DW, (7)
which equates the ﬂux of sand across the sloping bed surface to the rate of erosion
and deposition by the jet-induced current. In ﬁgure 6(a), the thickness of the current
is observed to vary roughly linearly with distance from the jetting head, i.e. h≈C xˆ
where C ≈ 1/10. If we assume that the momentum ﬂux of the current Σ =hu2 is
approximately conserved as the current entrains bed material and ambient water,
then u(xˆ)≈√Σ/h(xˆ), and therefore
U

which constitutes an idealized model of the trench response. The erosion rate is
strongest near the jetting head and decays with distance, whereas the settling rate
does not vary as long as suspended sand is available for deposition. The trench
consequently deepens as long as erosion exceeds deposition, but rises back towards
the undisturbed seabed level when settling starts to predominate. Neglecting the
standoﬀ distance between the jetting device and the sediment bed, this simple ODE
can be solved immediately over the interval 0  xˆ  L to yield

are, respectively, the maximum depth and the length of the trench. The dimensionless
proﬁle obtained in this way is plotted in ﬁgure 6(c). The trench shape is asymmetric,
with the point of maximum scour located at xˆ/L=1/4, in qualitative agreement with
the observed proﬁle of ﬁgure 6(a). Approximate quantitative agreement for the trench
depth and length for this and similar runs can be obtained by setting D=0.6 and
E=0.035.
The above simple model and approximate coeﬃcient values can be used to provide
rough estimates of various characteristic parameters. The aspect ratio of the trench
is for instance

as suspended load, with eroded sand grains eventually falling back to the bed by
gravitational settling.
To model the above processes, a sublayered shallow-ﬂow description is adopted.
Because the bed proﬁle may adopt a steep slope near the jet impingement, boundary-
ﬁtted coordinates are used. The curvilinear coordinate s denotes arclength along the
bed. The bed proﬁle (x(0), z(0)) can then be integrated from
∂x(0)
∂s
= cosβ,
∂z(0)
∂s
=−sinβ, (14)
where β is the local bed inclination below the horizontal. It is assumed that β is
a slowly varying function of time and space, which can be considered constant on
the scale of the adaptation time and length of the shallow current. Measured normal
to the bed, the depth h of the ﬂowing layer is considered small compared to the
radius of curvature  of the bed proﬁle, i.e. h . The turbulent layer is further
assumed to be sharply stratiﬁed into two distinct sublayers having depths h1 and
h2, where h1 + h2 =h. The lower sublayer of depth h1 is composed of a turbid
mixture of turbulent water and suspended sand. The upper sublayer, on the other
hand, features turbulent water taken to be entirely sediment-free. These two sublayers
are distinguished in order to let turbulent water detrain from the turbid layer. As
suggested by the experimental photographs of ﬁgures 4 and 5, the overall jet-induced
turbulent layer of depth h can be expected to expand monotonously owing to mixing
with the ambient, yet the thickness of its internal turbid layer h1 can eventually
decrease owing to the settling of sand grains. In addition to the bed proﬁle (x(0), z(0)),
two other interfaces are therefore of interest: turbid interface (x(1), z(1)) marks the limit
between the sediment-laden and clear-water sublayers, and outer interface (x(2), z(2))
16 A. T. H. Perng and H. Capart
respectively. Transfers are deﬁned positive when volume is transferred from a lower
layer to an upper layer. Conversely, transfers take negative values when volume
goes from an upper layer to a lower layer, as expected for instance for turbulent
entrainment from the outer ambient into the ﬂowing current across interface z(2).
Because their mass densities remain constant, equations for the mass balance of the
bed and sediment-free sublayers can be obtained simply by multiplying (21) and (23)
by the corresponding densities ρ0 and ρ2. In the turbid layer, however, the sediment
concentration and associated sublayer density can evolve. An additional equation for
mass balance is thus required and can be written
∂
∂t
(ρ1h1) +
∂
∂s
(ρ1h1v)= i
(0) − i(1), (24)
where the terms i(a), a=0, 1, denote mass transfers across the corresponding interfaces.
Again, mass transfers are deﬁned positive when going up from a lower to an upper
layer or sublayer. Two other useful equations can be obtained by linear combination of
equations (21)–(24). The ﬁrst is a balance equation for the overall mass m= ρ1h1+ρ2h2
of the ﬂowing layer (per unit bed surface):
∂m
∂t
+
∂
∂s
(mv)= i(0) − i(2), (25)
where the mass ﬂux i(2) across the outer interface is given by i(2) = ρ2e
(2). The second
is a conservation equation for the total sediment mass
∂
∂t
{(ρ0 − ρ∞)z(0) cosβ + (ρ1 − ρ∞)h1} + ∂
∂s
{(ρ1 − ρ∞)h1v} = 0, (26)
where the ﬁrst term denotes the local rate of change of the sediment mass contained
in both the bed and turbid sublayer, and the second term is the divergence of the
turbid ﬂux. In this equation, there are no non-conservative products on the left-hand
side, and no source or sink terms on the right-hand side. It is the only one of the
governing equations that can be cast in such a pure conservation form.
Because the two turbulent sublayers are assumed to share the same velocity v, a
single momentum equation is needed, with only along-bed momentum considered.
The corresponding balance equation is obtained for a control volume enclosing both
sublayers jointly (ﬁgure 7c). Neglecting non-hydrostatic eﬀects, momentum balance
in the normal-to-bed direction reduces to an expression for excess pressure (relative
to a sediment-free hydrostatic water column)
p(y)=
{
(ρ1 − ρ∞)g cosβ(h1 − y), 0  y  h1,
0, h1 <y,
(27)
where y is a local normal-to-bed coordinate, p(y) is the local excess pressure, and g
is the acceleration due to gravity. Including the thrust from these excess pressures,
momentum balance in the along-bed direction s can be written

The terms on the left-hand side of this equation represent momentum change and
ﬂux, pressure thrust, and the along-bed component of the submerged weight. On the
right-hand side, terms j (0) and j (2) represent momentum transfers across the lower and
upper boundaries separating the turbulent current from its underlying sediment bed
and outer ambient. Upwards transfers are again deﬁned positive. Equations (21)–(28)

For interface (x(1), z(1)) separating the turbid and clear-water sublayers, we have
i(1) = ρ1e
(1) + ι(1)1 = ρ2e
(1), (33)
where mass drift is absent on the right-hand side because of the assumption that the
top sublayer is entirely sediment-free. Because the two sublayers are assumed to share
the same velocity v, no relation for the momentum ﬂux j (1) is required. Finally, for
interface (x(2), z(2)) separating the turbulent layer and outer ambient, compatibility of
the momentum ﬂux requires
j (2) = vi(2) − τ (2)2 = 0, (34)
where i(2) = ρ2e
(2) = ρ∞e(2) and where τ (2)2 is the turbulent shear stress applied below
the interface. There is no mass drift on either side because both the upper sublayer
and outer ambient are composed of water alone. Furthermore, the right-hand side of
(34) is zero because the outer ambient is assumed to be devoid of both current and
turbulence. The mass drift and shear-stress functions discussed above are illustrated
in ﬁgure 7(d).
The balance equations and interface relations can be combined to obtain two
additional equations that will be useful for the calculations below. The ﬁrst is an
evolution equation for the mass density of the turbid sublayer

which takes the form of an advection-source equation, where the source function
is associated with mass drifts at the top and bottom of the sublayer. The second
equation is an equation of motion for the turbulent layer:

where the right-hand-side sink term involves two shear stresses: the free-shear
turbulent shear stress τ (2)2 acting along the inner side of the upper boundary of
the turbulent current, and the wall shear stress applied along the upper side of the
erodible bottom τ (0)1 (see ﬁgure 7d).
3.4. Mass drift and shear stress functions
Up to this point, the balance equations (21)–(28) and compatibility relations (31)–
(34) are direct consequences of our basic assumptions, combined with conservation
principles. To complete the description, however, it is necessary to provide semi-
empirical laws for the turbulent mass drift and shear stress functions. For the mass
drift functions, we adapt the classical sediment suspension theory of Rouse (1937)
and write

ι
(1)
1 = ξ
√
k(ρ1 − ρ2) − (ρ1 − ρ∞)ω cosβ, (38)
where each drift function is expressed as the sum of an upwards turbulent diﬀusive
ﬂux and a downwards gravitational settling ﬂux. The turbulent diﬀusive ﬂuxes are
assumed proportional to the square root of the speciﬁc turbulent kinetic energy k(per
unit mass), multiplied by the density diﬀerence experienced across the corresponding
interface. The non-dimensional proportionality constant ξ represents a ratio of eddy
length l to shear-layer thickness δy, both assumed to scale with the depth h of the
20 A. T. H. Perng and H. Capart
of an additional balance law for the evolution of the speciﬁc kinetic energy k of the tur-
bulent velocity ﬂuctuations, which intervenes in the three functions (37), (38) and (40).
3.5. Balance of mechanical energy
To close the description, energy balance must be invoked. The total mechanical energy
of the system is composed of three diﬀerent contributions: (i) the potential energy
of the bed, current, and ambient system; (ii) the kinetic energy of the mean ﬂow;
(iii) the kinetic energy of the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations. For the latter, we do not
distinguish between the solid and ﬂuid phase, and consider the joint kinetic energy
of the mixture. Approaches resolving the two phases separately have been proposed
by Hsu, Jenkins & Liu (2003) and Ten Cate et al. (2004), but exceed the level of
detail sought in the present work. Accordingly, the total energy ﬂux across a vertical
transect is due to advection of the diﬀerent energy components complemented by the
work of the excess pressure forces. The resulting balance equation is

(42)
where the ﬁrst term on the left-hand side is the time rate of change of the total
mechanical energy (sum of potential energy, mean ﬂow kinetic energy, and kinetic
energy of the turbulent ﬂuctuations, per unit bed surface), and the second term on the
left-hand side is the divergence of the energy ﬂux. Note that the potential energy is
measured with respect to a ground state in which the settled sea bed rises to elevation
z(0) = 0 below a sediment-free water ambient. The symbol γ on the right-hand side
of (42) is the energy dissipation function. Assuming an isothermal system, the second
law of thermodynamics requires that this dissipation function be everywhere positive,
i.e. γ  0 (see e.g. Abbott 1979).
In order to obtain a balance equation for the kinetic energy of the ﬂuctuations
alone, we can form the quasi-linear combination
(equation (42))− 1

(43)
After repeated application of the chain rule, a considerable amount of algebra,
and right-hand-side substitutions based on the compatibility relations (31)–(34), the
resulting equation simpliﬁes to

which is one of the key results of the overall derivation. This equation is a balance law
for the turbulence intensity k, where we recognize on the right-hand side the following
source and sink terms. The ﬁrst two terms are production terms associated with the
work of the mean ﬂow against the interfacial shear stress τ (a)b , and correspond to a
loss of kinetic energy by the mean ﬂow. The third term is a sink term associated
with the work of the turbulent ﬂuctuations against gravity, and corresponds to a gain
of potential energy induced by the upwards mass drifts ι(a)b . Finally, the last term
is the energy dissipation function, inherited from the overall balance of mechanical
energy (42). It is seen from the right-hand side of (44) that both the production and

4. Travelling-wave solutions
4.1. Equations in moving coordinates
We now consider the case of a plane jet travelling along an initially horizontal
sea bed. Approximating a steadily advancing injection dredge or jet trencher (see
ﬁgure 1b, c), the jetting device is assumed to move at constant speed U to the left.
To describe the resulting water ﬂow and sand bed response, it is then convenient to
postulate an observer moving with the jetting device at the same leftward speed U .
The corresponding change of independent variables (x, t) ↔ (xˆ, tˆ) is given by
xˆ = x + Ut, tˆ = t, (50)
where xˆ denotes horizontal distance from the origin of the travelling jet (ﬁgure 8a).
The associated curvilinear coordinate sˆ is such that
dxˆ
dsˆ
=
dx
ds
= cosβ. (51)
Using the chain rule, it follows that the time and spatial derivatives in balance
equations (21)–(28) transform to

In the moving frame of reference, furthermore, the bed and ambient acquire apparent
velocities uˆ0 = uˆ∞ =U , and the apparent velocity of the turbulent current becomes
vˆ= v + U/ cosβ. (53)
In terms of moving coordinates (sˆ, tˆ), transformed governing equations can be written

The ﬁrst three eigenvalues λ0, λρ and λk are associated with (54), (57) and (58), which
are already in characteristic form and are decoupled from the others. Eigenvalue λ∗
is associated with advection of the depth ratio h1/(h1 + h2) at the shared apparent
velocity vˆ of the two sublayers. Finally, λ− and λ+ are the speeds of the left and right
internal gravity waves. Although there are at least three repeated eigenvalues, the
system is endowed with a complete basis of six independent eigenvectors provided
that (ρ1 −ρ∞)h1 is non-zero (i.e. provided that suspended sand is present). The system
is then hyperbolic. If the bottom current is entirely free of suspended sediment, on
the other hand, eigenvalues λ− and λ+ and their eigenvectors collapse together, and
the eigenvector basis becomes deﬁcient.
As illustrated in ﬁgure 8, the jet-induced current will be assumed to ﬂow from left
to right, hence in what follows we restrict our attention to cases in which both U > 0
and vˆ > 0. Under these restrictions, the Jacobian matrix J will be regular everywhere
except at locations where
λ− = vˆ − c=0, (68)
causing the determinant to be equal to zero and the matrix to become singular. This
will occur for the following critical value of the local Froude number
Fˆ r =
vˆ
c
=
v + U/ cosβ√{(ρ1 − ρ∞) cosβ gh21}/m =1. (69)
The above is a generalized deﬁnition of the internal Froude number, modiﬁed
to account for the moving frame of reference, the sublayered structure, and the
ﬂow inclination. Using this revised deﬁnition, however, the Froude number can be
interpreted as in standard hydraulics to precisely identify distinct regimes of ﬂow.
Where Fˆ r > 1, the ﬂow is supercritical, and all wave speeds of the system are oriented
to the right, i.e. λa > 0 for a=0, ρ, k, ∗,−,+. Where Fˆ r =1, the ﬂow is critical, with a
stationary wave speed λ− =0, and a singular Jacobian matrix. Where Fˆ r < 1, ﬁnally,
the ﬂow is subcritical, with ﬁve wave speeds oriented to the right, i.e. λa > 0 for
a=0, ρ, k, ∗,+ and one wave speed oriented to the left, λ− < 0.
4.3. Longitudinal ﬂow structure
We now further restrict our attention to ﬂows which have attained steady state in
the moving frame of reference. The resulting solutions are known as travelling-wave
solutions (see e.g. Hydon 2000). As discussed in § 1, such solutions are of great
practical interest because dredging and jet trenching tools often operate continuously
over great distances, allowing the ﬂow pattern that they induce to converge to steady
state in a frame of reference attached to the jetting device. Such solutions are obtained
by setting the time derivatives ∂/∂tˆ to zero in (54)–(59). In matrix form, the reduced
system of equation can be written
J
dV
dsˆ
= S, (70)
which represents a coupled system of 6 ordinary diﬀerential equations. Before
integrating (70), we must ﬁrst clarify the appropriate boundary conditions and
consider the possible occurrence of critical sections where the matrix J will be
singular.
For a horizontal sea bed, we anticipate that the jet-induced sediment motion will
only take place over a ﬁnite distance behind the jetting device. Flowing to the right,
the jet-induced current will dissipate energy until it is no longer able to sustain a
sediment suspension. Consider the consequences of conservation equation (61), which

5. Flow and solution details
5.1. Jet expansion before impingement
We examine ﬁrst the development of the pure-water plane jet, before impingement
onto the sand bed. A highly concentrated point-like source of momentum is
considered, located at horizontal position xˆ =0 and elevation Z above the unperturbed
sea bed (ﬁgure 8a). This standoﬀ elevation is taken to remain constant as the jetting
device translates to the left. The jet is oriented at an angle α below the horizontal,
where 0<α< 90◦. The jet-induced water speed is assumed to be much larger than
the travelling speed, v U , and the inﬂuence of the latter is neglected at this stage
(i.e. we approximate vˆ ≈ v). Before impingement, the problem considered is thus the
expansion of a neutrally buoyant turbulent jet in a quiescent ambient. This is a
classical problem of turbulence research, which need not be solved anew, but it is
useful to treat it using the equations derived above in order to clarify their meaning
and consequences. Measuring distance using curvilinear coordinate sˆ, deﬁned again
along the lower interface of the expanding jet, we can write equations

These three equations describe balance of volume, momentum and turbulence
intensity, specialized to the case of a pure water jet in contact with a quiescent
water ambient along both its upper and lower boundaries. They constitute reduced
versions of (23), (28) and (44), with h1 = 0 and h=h2. The interface relations and
semi-empirical functions described above can also be adapted to express
e(0) =−e(2) = ξ√k, τ (0)2 =−τ (2)2 = ρ∞ξ

Using (78), we can express h=Σ/v2 where Σ =hv2 denotes the constant speciﬁc
momentum ﬂux of the jet. We now seek a similarity solution to (77)–(79) using the
ansatz
√
k=Av, where A is a dimensionless constant to be determined. It can then
be checked that the explicit solutions
h(sˆ)= 4ξ A sˆ, v(sˆ)=

Σ/h(sˆ),
√
k(sˆ)=Av(sˆ), (80)
satisfy (77)–(79) provided that constant A take the value A=
√
ξ/(χ − 2ξ ). In
accordance with a wealth of experimental data for plane turbulent jets, the result is
a jet of linearly increasing thickness h(sˆ)= 2 tan δ sˆ, where the wedge semi-angle δ is

and the volume and mass ﬂuxes q =hvˆ and m˙=mvˆ are also shock invariants. The
current thickness h′ downstream of the jump is then given by the following relation
h′ = 1

h{
√
1 + 8Fˆ r2 − 1}. (86)
This turns out to be identical to the classical jump relation of open-channel hydraulics
(Bakhmeteﬀ 1932), save for the non-standard deﬁnition (69) of the Froude number
Fˆ r .
An equation for the balance of mechanical energy can also be written

2
(ρ1 − ρ∞)g cosβ h21 + mk}vˆ + 12(ρ1 − ρ∞)g cosβ h21v]=−Γ, (87)
where Γ is the rate of energy dissipation associated with the jump. Note in (87) that
the convective ﬂux component features apparent velocity vˆ, but the term associated
with work of the pressure forces involves the original velocity v. Using relations
(84)–(87), lengthy but straightforward algebra leads to the following relation
[mkvˆ]= m˙ [k]= m˙c2
(h′ − h)3
4h2h′
− Γ, (88)
governing the change in turbulence intensity [k]= k′ − k across the jump. The ﬁrst term
on the right-hand side of (88) is a production term associated with the mechanical
energy lost by the mean ﬂow, and constitutes a generalization of the dissipation
formula for classical hydraulic jumps and bores (Stoker 1957). The second term on
the right-hand side, Γ , denotes the rate of dissipation of the total mechanical energy
(mean ﬂow+ turbulent ﬂuctuations), by processes acting locally within the jump. We
will neglect this term and simply set Γ =0.
Whereas the ﬂow thickness h on the upstream side of the jump is much smaller
than both the trench depth H and its local radius of curvature , this is not true
on the downstream side of the jump, where h ∼ H ∼ . As a result, the curvilinear
description no longer applies, and we revert to a Cartesian view for the region
xˆ > xˆJ downstream of the jump. In this region, we further apply the small-slope
approximation
sinβ ≈ tanβ, cosβ ≈ 1. (89)
To ensure compatibility of the pressure thrust terms, which dominate on the
downstream side of the jump, assumption (89) will be adopted for the shock relations
as well. With this precision, (85), (86) and (88) provide a complete set of relations
allowing us to compute the conjugate state downstream of the jump based on the
known upstream state. The matter of determining the jump position xˆJ , however, is
left unresolved, and will be addressed in the next subsection together with the critical
section.
5.3. Passage through the critical section
If the sediment-laden bottom current undergoes an internal hydraulic jump, then of
necessity it must pass through a critical section before reaching the end of the trench.
Let xˆC be the location of this critical section, where the local Froude number takes
the precise value Fˆ r =1 on the way back from sub- to supercritical ﬂow. Where
Fˆ r =1, however, the Jacobian matrix J is singular, and cannot be simply inverted
to determine the primitive variable gradients dV/dsˆ at that location. In fact, the
governing equations have no admissible solution at the critical section, unless the
source vector S of system (70) satisﬁes there the solvability condition
ST W (−) = 0, (90)
30 A. T. H. Perng and H. Capart
impingement point. For this purpose, an explicit second-order Runge-Kutta scheme
is used, advancing from curvilinear position sˆ to position sˆ+sˆ in the two successive
sub-steps
V (sˆ + 1
2
sˆ)= V (sˆ) + 1
2
sˆ J−1(V (sˆ)) S(V (sˆ)), (97)
V (sˆ + sˆ)= V (sˆ) + sˆ J−1(V (sˆ + 1
2
sˆ)) S(V (sˆ + 1
2
sˆ)). (98)
In order to preserve exactly the invariant (72), however, the turbid sublayer density
ρ1 is adjusted after each sub-step using
ρ1 = ρ∞ + (ρ0 − ρ∞)(−z(0)U )/(h1vˆ). (99)
Integration halts when either one of the following conditions are met. If the depth
h1 of the turbid sublayer drops to zero, then the end of the trench has been reached,
and the solution is complete. If, on the other hand, the Froude number decreases
below critical value Fˆ r =1 at some point along the way, then the assumption of a
fully supercritical ﬂow fails, and a solution featuring an internal hydraulic jump must
be sought instead. Let us deﬁne function F (xˆ) as the value of the Froude number
obtained at position xˆ using supercritical integration. An admissible supercritical
trench proﬁle will then be such that Fmin = minF (xˆ)> 1.
To construct a solution with a jump, a supercritical integration is ﬁrst performed
as described above, starting from the point of impingement. Each point along the
way is then a possible candidate for the location xˆJ of the internal hydraulic jump.
We associate with each candidate jump position xˆJ a value of the solvability function
G(xˆJ ), constructed as follows. The jump relations (85)–(88) are used to determine the
conjugate state V ′(xˆJ ) immediately downstream of the assumed jump, based on the
state V (xˆJ ) before the jump known from the supercritical integration. Integration of
the subcritical proﬁle is then continued, again from left to right, using the same Runge–
Kutta scheme, until a section xˆC is reached where the Froude number rises back to
the critical value Fˆ r =1. Having calculated the ﬂow state W (−)(xˆC) at that critical
section, the local source terms S(xˆC) can be obtained from (60), hence the solvability
product (92) can be evaluated at the critical section, i.e. G(xˆJ )= ST (xˆC)W (−)(xˆC). This
is interpreted as a function of the jump position xˆJ since the proﬁle downstream of
the jump depends on where the jump is assumed to occur.
The equilibrated jump position sought is therefore such that G(xˆJ )= 0, and the
problem becomes one of ﬁnding, if it exists, the root xˆJ of the solvability function
G. This function takes negative values near impingement, rises in the downstream
direction, then decreases again, taking a maximum Gmax = maxG(xˆJ ) at a certain
candidate jump location xˆJ,max =argmaxG(xˆJ ). If Gmax > 0, then a jump is possible
in the interval xˆI < xˆJ < xˆJ,max . The function G(xˆJ ) is found to be monotonous in this
interval, hence it is straightforward to ﬁnd the simple root xˆJ using bisection. Once
this root has been found, we can continue the left-to-right integration past the critical
section until the end of the trench is reached.
The conditions under which admissible solutions with and without jumps can be
constructed can thus be summarized as follows. A fully supercritical proﬁle (without
jump) is such that Fmin > 1. An admissible transcritical proﬁle (with an internal jump
along the way), on the other hand, is such that Gmax > 0. Depending on the jet and
sand properties, it turns out that three cases are possible. For certain values of the
governing parameters, Fmin > 1 and Gmax < 0, implying that only the fully supercritical
proﬁle is admissible. For other values, Fmin < 1 and Gmax > 0, which means that only
the solution with a jump is admissible. Finally, there is a domain of overlap where

exhibits a curved proﬁle which transitions smoothly from a steep trenching front
upstream to a backﬁll tail of milder adverse slope. In the upstream part of the
trenching front, close to the point of impingement, the bed proﬁle features a steep

suspended sediment concentration n1, the asymptotic result is n1 → n0/2. Because of
the upstream boundary conditions, constraints (49) and (83), and the lag distance
required for equilibration, however, the concentration will start from below and never
quite reach this value. Value n1,max = n0/2 thus constitutes an upper bound for the
suspended sediment concentration that can be attained in the turbid sublayer.
Figure 10 shows corresponding plots for a slower speed of advance, set to value
U =3 cm s−1, with all other parameters kept the same as before. For this case, the only
admissible solution features an internal hydraulic jump. As illustrated in ﬁgure 10(a),
the eroding jet ﬁrst plunges down a steep trenching front, limited by constraint (83)
shown as a dash-dotted line. This intense erosion is cut short when the thin shooting
current undergoes an internal hydraulic jump, beyond which the turbid interface
slightly overshoots the original sea-bed level. Shown in ﬁgure 10(b), the current
velocity v undergoes a sudden drop at the jump transition. The modelled turbulence
intensity k, on the other hand, rises across the jump owing to the assumed energy
transfer from the mean ﬂow. This enhanced turbulence intensity allows the slower
ﬂow to erode the sea-bed gently beyond the jump, delaying re-deposition until further
downstream.
Eventually, turbulence dissipates, at which point the backﬁll limb of the trench
approaches the turbid pool approximation of (93)–(96), with a linear rise of the bed
proﬁle (dash-dotted line), back to the undisturbed sea, bed level where the trench
terminates. For this case, the jump is located at position xˆJ = 0.034 m, such that
the steady ﬂow passes smoothly through a critical section at position xˆC = 0.221m,
before the trench ends at position xˆE =0.244m. Figure 10(c) shows how the sand
concentration in the turbid sublayer rises along the supercritical upstream stretch
of the proﬁle, then drops slightly immediately after the jump, where entrainment of
ambient water exceeds erosion of bed material. The suspended sand concentration
then rises again to approach a constant value in the downstream turbid-pool region,
but this value lies below the limiting concentration n1,max = n0/2 (dash-dotted line).
Figure 11 shows the case of intermediate speed of advance, set here to value
U =5 cm s−1, with all the other parameters again left unchanged. For this speed, the
admissibility conditions overlap, and solutions with and without a jump can both
be constructed. Figure 11(a) shows the ﬂow pattern computed under the assumption
that no jump forms, while ﬁgure 11(b) shows the resulting proﬁles when a jump is
introduced. Both ﬂows represent admissible steady-state solutions for the exact same
model and operating parameters. The resulting proﬁles are therefore strictly identical
in their upstream portion, where the ﬂow is supercritical. Figure 11(a) shows how the
supercritical proﬁles can be continued to the end of the trench without any regime
transition. The current gradually expands, but remains thin throughout the erosion
and deposition process. Figure 11(b), on the other hand, shows the alternative steady
proﬁles obtained when an internal jump is allowed to form. The ﬂow then undergoes
a sudden expansion at the jump, with the turbid sublayer invading the whole depth
of the trench. Eventually, however, the suspended sand settles back to the bed which

ratio H/L, where H and L are, respectively, the trench depth and trench length. The
eﬀective settling speed ω, on the other hand, inﬂuences both the size and aspect ratio
of the trench, with larger sizes and smaller H/L ratios obtained for lower values of
the eﬀective settling speed. Although results are sensitive to the precise choice of f
and ω, the tuned values nevertheless fall within the range expected from past work
(for the friction factor) and from our settling column tests (for the settling speed).
Without forcing or case-by-case tuning, the proposed model is thus able to predict
the main features of the system response over a range of jetting conditions.
6.2. Trench depth
Figure 14 further documents the dependence of the trench depth H on the speed of
Q1
advance U and jetting strength Σ , using data from a larger set of 38 experimental runs.
The trench depth is deﬁned as the maximum drop of the bed proﬁle below its initial
level, i.e. H = max(−z(0)(xˆ)). As noted previously, this depth tends to increase for
higher jetting strengths and slower speeds of advance. In ﬁgure 14, data points from
runs with and without a hydraulic jump are plotted using ﬁlled and open symbols,
respectively, with diﬀerent symbol shapes associated with the three jetting strengths
tested Σ1 = 5.8 l s
−2, Σ2 = 8.1 l s−2, and Σ3 = 10.6 l s−2. For comparison, calculated
curves for the internal jump case and purely shooting-ﬂow case are plotted as solid
and dashed lines, respectively. For intermediate speeds of advance, both types of
solution are admissible and the two sets of curves overlap.
For jetting strengths Σ1 and Σ3, the obtained relationship between trench depth
and speed of advance features a break of trend at the transition between regimes
with and without jumps. In the absence of internal jump, the trench depth varies
roughly with the inverse of the speed of advance (dashed lines and open symbols).
A deeper trench results when the sand bed is exposed longer to the erosive action

ﬂows (algebraic symbols), observed at very slow speeds of advance; ﬂows with an
internal hydraulic jump (ﬁlled symbols) observed at slow speeds; and shooting ﬂows
(open symbols) observed at high speeds of advance. These correspond, respectively,
to ﬁgures 5(a) to 5(d), reproduced in cartoon form on the phase diagram of ﬁgure 15.
To facilitate comparison with results from other tests, we have provided in ﬁgures 14
and 15 alternative abscissae and ordinates expressed in dimensionless form, taking
the fall speed W and acceleration due to gravity g as normalizing variables.
On the same diagram, lines are used to delineate the domains of admissibility
of solutions with and without jump, as computed on the basis of our shallow-ﬂow
theory. The solid line denotes condition Gmax =0 which, for a given jetting strength,
represents the fastest speed of advance at which a jump may form. The dashed line
denotes condition Fmin =1, which likewise represents the slowest speed of advance at
which the ﬂow can remain supercritical throughout the trench. The sector comprised
between these two curves represents the domain of overlap in which both types of
solution are admissible.
Agreement between theory and experiments requires that only open symbols
(shooting ﬂows) be observed to the right of the solid line, and that only solid
symbols (ﬂows with internal jumps) be found to the left of the dashed line, with both
types of symbol allowed inside the sector of overlap (where both ﬂow patterns can
theoretically occur). The observations are found to be consistent with these domain
predictions. Nevertheless, we emphasize again that the experiments conducted at zero
and very slow speeds of advance (circled and uncircled algebraic symbols) lie outside
the scope of the theory. For these conditions, the jet-induced ﬂow either rolls up into
a spanwise vortex or separates from the bed, and the theory breaks down.
7. Conclusions
In the present work, theory and experiments were used to examine underwater
sand beds exposed to the geomorphic action of travelling plane jets. This jetting
action leads to the formation of a translating scour hole of permanent shape, in
which the turbulent current negotiates a dynamic equilibrium with the curved bed
proﬁle. The turbulent underﬂow erodes and deposits sediment from the static bed,
while simultaneously entraining quiescent water from the outer ambient. Because of
sediment suspension, the bottom current acquires a higher density than the ambient,
allowing gravity to aﬀect both the turbulence generation and the longitudinal balance
of the ﬂow. In particular, gravitational inﬂuence on the sediment-laden current can be
strong enough to force a transition between supercritical and subcritical ﬂow, leading
to the formation of an internal hydraulic jump.
As a result, the jet-induced bottom currents can equilibrate into two types of steady
proﬁle inside the travelling trench: shooting ﬂows, which remain thin throughout,
or ﬂows featuring a sudden expansion at the internal hydraulic jump. For constant
jetting strength, the transition from shooting-ﬂow to internal-jump regimes takes place
when the speed of advance of the travelling jet goes from fast to slow. Slower speeds
of advance lead to longer exposure of the bed to the erosional action of the plane jet,
leading to a deeper scour hole. Eventually, the sediment-laden current cannot ﬂow
out of the deep hole it has dug itself into without ﬁrst undergoing an internal jump.
By slowing down the current, the jump curtails its erosive action and acts as a limiter
on the trench depth. Internal-jump formation also leads to trenches of shorter length.
On the downstream side of the jump, the sediment-laden current ponds into a turbid
pool where sand grains settle back to the bed.

DUE TO MOVING POINT JETS

ABSTRACT  
Laboratory experiments are performed to investigate the water and sediment motions due 
to needle jets moved steadily along a submerged bed of fine sand. These point-like jets 
represent small-scale analogues of the jetting swords used by Remotely Operated Vehicles 
(ROVs) to bury submarine cables and pipelines under a protective sand cover. The features 
observed in the experiments include the longitudinal flow structure and bed profile within the 
jet-incised trench, as well as the turbid overspill induced when the jet-induced sediment-laden 
current flows over the lateral walls of the trench. Distinct overspill patterns are observed 
depending on the power and travelling speed of the moving jets. For a given power, slow 
speeds induce overflow turbidity currents that radiate outward and propagate ahead of their 
point of emergence from the trench. Fast travelling speeds, by contrast, induce swept back 
turbid plumes that spread only in the downstream direction, away from the jets. Overspill 
patterns are important in practice because they control the loss of sediment from the trench, 
the resulting loss of sand cover for the buried product, and possible adverse environmental 
effects due to the stirring and dispersal of turbid plumes.  
 
Keywords: jet trenching, turbidity current, moving jet. 
 
1  INTRODUCTION 
Developments in the energy and telecommunication industries have led to the rapid 
growth of extensive networks of submarine cables and pipelines. The laying and maintenance 
of such underwater links increasingly relies on the use of jet trenchers. These are remotely 
operated vehicles (ROVs) designed to bury, in a single pass, a cable or pipeline (the product) 
under a protective sand cover. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the vehicle travels steadily along the 
exposed product, laid previously along the seabed, and uses powerful jetting arms (or swords) 
to scour a temporary trench which extends for some distance to the rear of the vehicle. The 
cable sinks into the trench, and is then buried further away from the trencher by the sediments 
settling out of the jet-induced plume. The jets operate continuously as the vehicle travels over 
long distances, burying the product along the way down to typical depths of 1 to 2 m under 
the seabed. Such burial depths are required to protect the product from fishing nets and 
trailing anchors.  
In keeping with the main theme of the Congress, “Harmonizing the Demands of Art and 
Nature in Hydraulics”, the design and operation of jet trenchers raises a number of technical 
and environmental issues. From the point of view of engineering art, the problem is one of 
determining the jetting configuration and operating conditions which can produce the desired 
product burial at minimum cost. To achieve this goal, it is important to better understand the 
influence of jetting parameters and seabed properties on the depth and length of open trench 
created by the jetting swords. Furthermore, one must seek to minimize the loss of sand from 
the trench, which depletes the sand cover protecting the cable or pipeline after the jetting pass. 
From an environmental point of view, a key consideration is to minimize disturbances to 
submarine life during and after the trenching process. This again requires limiting the amount 
of seabed sediment suspended and dispersed away from the trench by the jetting process. 
 
Figure 1. Jet trenching configurations used in the field and in our small-scale laboratory 
experiments: (a) actual jet trencher vehicles are typically equipped with a pair of jetting swords, 
placed on both sides of the product (cable or pipeline) to be buried. The pipeline sinks into the 
seabed thanks to the temporary open trench eroded by the jets, and is then buried by the 
sediment settling out of the turbid plume further away from the advancing trencher; (b)

simultaneously acquire side and top views of the jet-induced flow pattern. 
 
Figure 3. Time-lapse photographs of the flow pattern generated by a rapidly advancing jet (U = 
3.2 cm/s) operating at low power (Q = 175 ml/min). The mirror shown in Fig. 1d is used to 
produce the top views observed in the background. The marks on the scale bars are 1 cm long. 
 
Unlike the transverse plane jets considered by Perng and Capart (2006), the circular jet 
can erode the loose sidewall of the trench as well as the bottom. Nevertheless, vertical erosion 
is much more rapid than lateral erosion, and the jet-induced turbulent current at first confines 
itself within a narrow trench. Beyond the internal hydraulic jump, overspill occurs once the 
upper boundary of the turbid current exceeds the trench wall. At this point turbid water flows 
laterally outwards and entrains suspended sand out of the confines of the trench. The 
corresponding sand loss leads to an incomplete backfill of the trench. In the present 
experiments conducted with very fine sand, the backfill material does not immediately 
For both flow rates, similar evolutions are observed when the speed of advance is 
increased. First, because the jet has more time to exert its eroding action when the jet 
advances more slowly, deeper trenches are observed for slow speeds of advance. The 
corresponding jet-induced turbid currents are also thicker and slower, and redeposit their 
sediment earlier. For the lower flow rate case (Fig. 4), the internal hydraulic jump switches 
from strong to weak as the speed of advance increases. For the higher flow rate case (Fig. 5), 
a slower speed of advance leads to a drowned hydraulic jump which has migrated right up to 
the upstream limit of the trench. At higher speed of advance, the jump is pushed back into the 
trench.  
 As seen in panels (c) of Figures 4 and 5, turbid overspill above the trench walls 
exhibits different patterns depending on the speed of advance of the jets. At low speeds of 
advance, the overspill radiates outward and propagates ahead of their point of emergence 
from the trench, leading to the formation of a curved wave front. Fast speeds of advance, by 
contrast, induce swept back turbid plumes that spread only in the downstream direction, away 
from the jets. Similar transitions between U-shaped and V-shaped overspill patterns are 
observed for both low and high values of the jet flow rate, although the transition occurs at 
different values of the speed of advance.

5  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we described some preliminary results from laboratory experiments devoted 
to travelling circular jets. The experiments involve needle jets moved along sand beds, 
representing small-scale analogues of the swords used by submarine jet trencher vehicles. 
Despite the simplified conditions considered, rather complicated patterns of water and 
sediment motions can be observed. Within the jet-incised trench, interesting features include 
the formation of an internal hydraulic jump and the accumulation of liquefied backfill. 
Outside the trench, different overspill patterns are observed depending on the speed of 
advance of the jetting tool, with a likely impact on sand loss from the trench and sand 
dispersal in the surrounding environment. A great deal of further work will be required to 
understand the physical mechanisms involved, describe quantitatively the influence of the 
various controlling parameters, and upscale experimental findings to prototype conditions.
