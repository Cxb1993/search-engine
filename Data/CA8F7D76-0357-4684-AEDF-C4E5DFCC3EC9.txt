1. Scope and Purposes 
As we all know, the supplier will 
offer the retailer a trade credit period to 
induce a huge orders, an important 
problem associated with inventory 
maintenance is to decide where to stock 
the items. Maybe rented warehouse is 
used when the ordering quantity exceeds 
the limited capacity of the owned 
warehouse.  
Therefore, we study a deterministic 
inventory model for deteriorating items 
under limited storage capacity (own 
warehouse and rented warehouse) and 
permissible delay in payments is 
developed to help the decision-maker to 
make the decision. Herein, it is assumed 
that deterioration rates of items in the 
two warehouses may be different. Firstly, 
expressions are derived for the total a 
cost of the inventory system, respectively. 
Secondly, for these models, the optimal 
solution not only exists but also is unique. 
Thirdly, a theorem is developed to 
determine the optimal cycle time and 
order size. Finally, sensitivity analysis of 
the optimal solution with respect to the 
parameters of the system is carried out. 
2. Literature Review  
Recently, several researchers have 
discussed a two-warehouse inventory 
system such as Hartely (1976). In this 
system, it is assumed that the holding

Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) considered an 
EOQ model with an exponential 
deterioration rate under the condition of 
permissible delay in payments. Chu et al. 
(1998) examined the economic ordering 
policy of deteriorating items in Aggarwal 
and Jaggis’ model. Jamal et al. (1997) 
further generalized Aggarwal and Jaggis’ 
model to allow for shortages. Shah (1993a) 
extended an EOQ model in which delays 
in payment were permissible and items 
in inventory deteriorated at a constant 
rate over time. Chen and Chung (1999) 
analyzed buyer’s economic order model 
under trade credit. Davis and Gaither 
(1985) developed an EOQ model for firms 
offering a one-time opportunity to delay 
payments for the order of a commodity. 
Shah (1993b) developed a probabilistic 
time-scheduling model for an 
exponentially decaying inventory when 
payment delays were permissible. Hwang 
and Shinn (1997) developed a retailer’s 
pricing and lot-sizing policy for 
exponentially deteriorating products 
under the condition of permissible delay 
in payments. Sarker et al. (2001) 
developed an optimal payment time 
under permissible delay for payment for 
products with deterioration. The other 
relevant papers related to the delay of 
payments such as Arcelus and Srinivasan 
(1993), Chung (1998), Chung et al. (2001), 
Chung and Liao (2004, 2006), 
Daellenbach (1986), Haley and 
Higgins(1973), Jaggi and Aggarwal 
(1994), Jammal et al. (2000), Shinn 
(1997), Shinn and Hwang (2003) and 
their references.

5. Self-Evaluation 
This research corresponds to the 
original plan and has attained its aim. 
Hence, the study is of great academic 
value and suitable for publication in 
academic journals.
