ABSTRACT 
Recent publications have presented successful implementations of adaptive control techniques in 
various applications. The advantage of a model reference adaptive structural control (MRASC) 
algorithm is to adjust the control command signal while estimating the system parameters of the 
controlled structure in real time. An adaptive control application based on Lyapunov stability 
theory is presented in this report. The Lyapunov equation used to define the adaptation law is 
designed based on a quadratic Lyapunov function candidate. This energy-like scalar function 
comprises tracking error states and estimation-error matrix of the adjustable feedback parameters. 
The adaptive feedback control force is calculated from both the measured states and the 
adjustable parameters estimated from the adaptation law. The error states illustrate the trajectory 
tracking performance between reference model and controlled system. The global asymptotical 
stability is guaranteed by choosing a pair of positive-definite weighting matrices for the 
time-invariant linear system. A series of control performance investigation is performed in this 
study to determine appropriate combination of parameters embedded in these weighing matrices. 
Finally, a real-time fiber-optic connected share memory network is proposed to perform the 
experimental verification of proposed MRASC algorithm. 
 
Keywords: active control, model-reference adaptive structural control, nonlinear control,

一、 前言 
在主動控制系統實際設計與安裝中，欲確保主動或半主動減振裝置能達到原始之設計
效果，其關鍵在於準確識別出受控系統的特性，並憑以設計及選擇適當有效的控制法則與
參數；於實務施行上，必須將理論之控制律轉化為能實際產生控制訊號之控制器，以及準
確根據回饋量測訊號，計算並發出即時控制命令以掌握控制裝置之運行。為了要達到這樣
的需求，必須克服許多訊號量測之誤差、油壓制動器之非線性特性及受控結構參數不確定
等效應。本研究引入自適應式主動結構控制之概念，用以控制參數不確定系統於地震作用
下之動態反應，並採用記憶體共享光纖網路設備進行控制訊號發送與控制成效之實驗驗證。 
二、 研究目的 
建築或設備結構之振動控制研究主要為減低環境振源對系統之影響，而且實務應用之
振動控制設計要求，必須能隨時掌握變動中之外在振源之動態特性，及能確保控制效果強
健性以包容輸出訊號量測之雜訊誤差或甚而系統之非線性特性，並藉以調節或補償所採用
之減振裝置，以達到最佳之振動控制效果。本研究利用自適應式主動結構控制之概念以達

五、 參考模型自適應式結構控制效果 
本文中提及的自適應控制是一種非線性控制，控制效益及追蹤之效果與參數的選擇有
關。在適應律中，除了與追蹤誤差相關也和系統反應量有關，亦即與輸入地震絕對地表加
速度(PGA)有關。然而P和Γ的選擇有許多的限制條件，本文利用隨機外力為輸入，依收斂
的速率來選擇控制參數，並用1940 El Centro南北向地震記錄(如圖二)來驗證控制效果。 
5.1 參數誤差權重係數選擇 
對於一單自由度的主動鋼鍵受控系統如圖三所示(Chung et al. 1998)，質量為2922.1 
kg，自然振動頻率為2.5 Hz，阻尼比為1.24 %。其自適應式主動控制力U( )t = 4 cos ( )ck u tα
可經由移動與預力鋼鍵相連的千斤頂而產生，其中，鋼鍵勁度 ck 為371910 N/m，夾角α 為
36D。為了測試參考模型適應式控制的效果，選定之理想模型系統具有與受控系統相同的質
量，但是設計的自然振動頻率為3.52 Hz，阻尼比為11.66 %。此單自由度系統之參數誤差權
重矩陣為

前述為利用隨機外力輸入來測試控制效果，一般來說地震波的特性和隨機外力輸入有
很大的差異。地震波大概可分3個階段，初始的前震通常較小，緊接著會有較大的強震，之
後是較小的終震。在這樣的狀況下，若利用隨機外力所計算的參數，直接應用於受地震作
用情況通常會過於保守。Case 5至case 7為受控系統受El Centro地震作用之測試，其結果如
圖六和圖七所示。如先前所預期在case 5的參數調整過於緩慢，最好的解決方式為將參數誤
差權重係數放大。由圖六和圖七中可看出case 5的可調整參數在約2.5秒，case 6約於2秒左右
才穿越理想參數的位置，但在case 7中約1秒左右就穿越理想參數的位置。 
六、 應用即時結構反應模擬器(RTSS)進行試驗驗證 
6.1 即時結構反應模擬器(RTSS)簡介 
為簡化整體結構控制即時模擬試驗技術，並整合資料傳遞之界面處理與溝通技術，本
研究利用 Mathworks 配套開發程式(Matlab+Simulink+RTW+xPC Target) (MathWorks, 2006)
進行研發，並引入記憶體共享光纖網路之硬體設備及其可執行即時平行運算之觀念，藉由
已開發完成之記憶體共享光纖網路卡硬體驅動程式庫，來進行應用「記憶體共享光纖網路
平行運算與模擬控制試驗」架構之即時控制效果模擬測試平台之軟體研發與硬體測試；「記
憶體共享光纖網路平行運算與模擬控制試驗設備」包含三組個人電腦與兩組 SCRAMNet 
SC150e PCI 界面卡，詳細之測試平台包含四項設備如圖八所示。 
其中即時建模及主控電腦(PC-1)用以建立「即時結構反應模擬器」所欲模擬之建築結
構離散時間 Simulink 模型、「即時結構反應積分器」Simulink 模型以及「自適應式即時控制
訊號產生器」Simulink 模型。個別之 Simulink 模型根據所採用之 PCI 界面「記憶體共享光
纖網路平行運算與模擬控制系統」，利用 Virtual C++編譯程式及開放式硬體驅動程式庫
(RTW)，將其自動轉譯為一般個人電腦處理器之機器語言，並配合專屬之 xPC Target 作業
環境，藉由無線網路，將個別要件之模型載入個人電腦之處理器(xPC-1, xPC-2)，以進行即
時控制模擬測試。 
即時結構反應模擬器用以模擬欲控制結構之動態反應，基於離散時間狀態空間理論進
行數值積分計算，產生受到環境外力作用時之實際動態反應，經由「記憶體共享光纖網路
平行運算與模擬控制系統」傳送至自適應式控制訊號產生器，用以提供計算控制力所需之
系統狀態量測訊號。也可以經由人為調整時間延遲之長短或加入訊號量測噪音等真實應用
時會面臨之問題，因此利用此系統可實際由動態反應輸出之效果或穩定性，直接觀察並驗
證所採用之自適應式控制律之優劣或成效。 
自適應式即時控制訊號產生器負責控制力之計算。經過參考模型自適應式結構控制律
之控制力計算，再將所預備施加在原始結構之控制力，傳回共享之記憶體位址，提供「即
時結構反應模擬器」用以併入下一步階結構動態反應積分計算之中，經由此即時互動式控
制模擬試驗 可驗證數值模擬之控制效果是否真實有效。 
記憶體共享光纖網路平行運算與模擬控制系統能將分散式電腦內部的記憶體經過數值
運算後，透過光纖網路快速地更新到每一部電腦，各部電腦在我們所分配區塊內記憶體的
資料會保持相同，因此這樣的環境就如同所有的電腦共用一個記憶體一樣。在「記憶體共
享光纖網路平行運算與模擬控制系統」中，電腦內存放的記憶體是隨著運算而改變，當有
新的資料寫入記憶體內時，修改後的資料會立刻以 150Mbits/sec 的速率，經由高速光纖傳
送到其他網路節點並更新共享的記憶體。資料在每一個結點傳送的時間只須要 250-800奈
秒。並且可以利用光纖訊號，同時更新相距 3500 公尺內的 256 個結點。此項技術使分散式

雷利阻尼(Rayleigh damping)假設，受控之原始結構之第一和第二模態之阻尼比皆設為5%。
而參考模型選定的阻尼比皆為15%。參數的設計方式和先前討論的單自由度相同，先選擇
均勻分佈輸入雜訊，然後估算參考模型一樓、二樓和三樓的位移和速度分別為0.02m、0.04m、 
0.05m以及0.1m/sec、0.2m/sec、0.3m/sec。求解理亞普諾夫方程式，可得對應之P矩陣。此
例因只增加系統的阻尼比，因此理想時變增益 *θ 之上半部 *1θ 的值皆為0，其對應的 1γ =

地震記錄進行測試，其可調參數的改變歷時如圖十五所示，由其歷時可看出在前5秒受控結
構和參考模型之系統誤差較大，因此可調參數改變速率相當快，在10秒後其改變速率變慢，
其值並趨向理想時變增益 *2θ 中每一個元素值。圖十六和圖十七為其控制效果，由其結果可
知受控結構之位移和速度反應較未控制時小，達到良好的控制效果。自適應式控制的位移
和速度追蹤效果如圖十八和圖十九所示，由其模擬結果可知在5秒內就可讓受控的系統和設
計之理想模型有相同的反應。 
八、 結論 
本研究應用參考模型自適應式控制理論，並推導自適應機制中所需要的適應律，利用
自適應式控制力來讓受控制的結構和理想參考模型反應接近。由於適應律中有許多參數要
決定，本研究亦闡述相關參數的選定方式，最後並將此理論嵌入即時控制效果模擬測試平
台中進行模擬測試，以了解實際控制所會面臨的問題。

2 MODEL-REFERENCE ADAPTIVE 
STRUCTURAL CONTROL (MRASC) 
ALGOTRITHM UNDER EARTHQUAKE 
EXCITATION 
2.1 Equation of Motion of MRASC Controlled 
Systems 
The block diagram of a model-reference adaptive 
structural control (MRASC) system is shown in Fig-
ure 1. It is composed of four parts: a controlled 
structure containing unknown parameters, a refer-
ence model structure for specifying the desired out-
put of the controlled structure, an adaptive controller 
to generate feedback control force based on system 
states and adjustable parameters, and an adaptation 
mechanism (defined as the adaptation loop) for up-
dating the adjustable parameters. To gain insights 
about the behavior of the MRASC systems and also 
to avoid mathematical complexity, we assume the 
unknown parameters of the controlled structure are 
constant. In practice, the MRASC algorithm is often 
used to handle time-varying unknown parameters.

For illustration purpose without loosing its gen-
eralization, we apply this MRASC algorithm to a 
linear time-invariant system subjected to earthquake 
excitation as follow,

In equation (1)，M , pC , and pK are the nn×  
mass, damping, and stiffness matrices; ( )p tx , 
( )p tx , and ( )p tx  are the 1n×  relative displace-
ment, velocity, and acceleration vectors. 
( ) ( )t t=U τu  is the 1m×  adaptive control force 
vector distributed by the mn×  controller location 
matrix 2b , among which ( )idiag τ=τ  ( 1i m= ∼ ) 
is the m m×  diagonal matrix, and ( )tu  is the 
1m×  adaptive control signal vector. In practical 
application, iτ  is the scaling constant between the 
control force and the adaptive control signal of the i-
th controller. Due to earthquake acceleration excita-
tion ( )gx t , )(txgMh− is the 1×n  equivalent iner-
tia force distributed by the 1×n  influence vector

respectively.  
2.2 Equation of Motion of the Reference Model 
According to the concept of model-reference adap-
tive structural control, reference model is to generate 
the desired structural responses (ideal trajectories) 
that will be tracked by the controlled system during 
the complete episode of an earthquake. Here, we 
choose a reference model with designed dynamic 
properties (natural frequencies and damping ratios) 
and the known mass matrix. Its equation of motion 
can be similarly formulated as

trix, and the 2 1n×  external loading location matrix 
of the reference model, respectively. They are de-
noted with subscript m, whereas, the corresponding 
matrices of the controlled structure are denoted with 
subscript p. 
2.3 Design of Adaptive Feedback Control Law 
An adaptive state-feedback control law is proposed 
here to move the poles of the controlled system into 
its model-reference counterpart with the time-
varying adjustable parameters and the measurements 
of system states. The adaptive control force ( )tU  
defined in equation (1) can be calculated according 
to the adaptive control signal ( )tu  as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )T pt t t t=U τu = τ θ X  (5) 
where ( ) ( ) ( )T T Td vt t t⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦θ = θ θ  is the 2m n×  time-
3 CONTROL PERFORMANCE OF MRASC 
Due to the non-linearity of the proposed adaptive 
scheme, the control effectiveness and tracking per-
formance are obviously dependent on the selection 
of control parameters as well as the types of input 
excitation. In the absence of modeling errors, the 
previous adaptive laws assure parameters conver-
gence of the adjustable parameter vector ( )tθ to the 
ideal value *θ  provided that the input excitation is 
persistently exciting. (Ioannou & Datta 1991).   
However, some restrictions should be applied on the 
selection of adaptation weighting matrices P  and 
Γ , which dominate the scalar function of 
Lyapunov’s direct method. In this study, a system-
atic investigation is conducted firstly on a single de-
gree-of-freedom structure, shown in Figure 2, sub-
jected to a uniformly distributed random excitation 
to demonstrate their influence. The appropriate 
choice on these parameters is recommended for fast 
convergence rate. Secondly, the ground acceleration 
record of 1940 El Centro earthquake (N-S compo-
nent), shown in Figure 3, is used as the base excita-
tion for performance verification.

3.1 Procedures for Selecting Appropriate 
Adaptation Parameters 
An idealized SDOF active tendon system with mass, 
m = 2922.1 kg, natural frequency, pω = 2.5 Hz, and 
damping ratio, pζ = 1.24%, as shown in Figure 
2(Chu et al. 2004). The adaptive control force 
U( )t =  4 cos ( )ck u tα  can be generated through the 
movement of actuator connected to pre-stress ten-
dons, where ck = 371910 N/m, and 36α = D  are the 
stiffness and inclination angle of the tendons, re-
spectively. Also, we choose a reference model with 
natural frequency, mω = 3.52 Hz, and damping ratio, 
mζ = 11.66%. 
In order to fulfill the asymptotically stability 
requirement, the adaptation mechanism derived in 
equation (15) must be applied in real-time to adjust 
the adaptive control signal correspondingly. For a 
SDOF system, its adaptation weighting matrix re-
lated to the parameter estimation error can be de-
fined as

Equation (18) illustrates the relevant factors 
that will contribute to the convergence rates of cor-
responding adjustable parameters. 12P  and 22P  de-
termine the weighting between displacement track-
ing error and velocity tracking error, whereas 1γ  
and 2γ  dominate the adaptive rates directly. With 
so many controlling factors involved in the design of 
adaptation law, few suggested design rules are given 
in the referred articles. A preliminary study (Chu et 
al. 2004) is conducted by varying those parameters 
individually and shows that the combined adaptive 
rate will dominate the performance of a MRASC 
system. 
First of all, a necessary and sufficient condition 
for the error state system defined by equation (8) to 
be asymptotically stable is that, for any symmetric 
positive definite matrix Q, the unique matrix P , 
solution of the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov equation 
(12), be symmetric positive definite. (Slotine & Li 
1991). For demonstration, we choose a symmetric

According the qualifying verifications performed 
based on random input, we now proceed to apply the 
recommended MRASC scheme subjected to a 
destructive earthquake. In general, the wave profiles 
of real earthquakes are different from the assumed 
uniformly distributed random input. They usually 
consist of initial-motion, strong-motion, and residual 
-motion stages, respectively. Therefore, the 
recommend adaptation parameters will be too 
conservative for aseismic applications. 
For El Centro earthquake input, the evolution 
profiles of ( )d tθ  and ( )v tθ  for Cases 5~7 are il-
lustrated and compared in Figures 7-8. As expected, 
the convergence of adjustable parameters is poor for 
Case 5 and is improved gradually as the adaptation 
gains increase. The adjustable parameters drop 
across their ideal value within 2.5 sec. for Case 5 
and only 1 sec. for Case 7. Nevertheless, the chatter-
ing behavior is apparent for Case 7 especially in the 
strong-motion stage. 
4 CONCLUSIONS 
The basic idea of a Model-Reference Adaptive 
Structural Control system is introduced and the deri-
vation the proposed adaptive feedback control algo-
rithm to fulfill the implementation requirement of 
civil structure under seismic loading is investigated. 
The real time control performance of proposed 
MRASC system and its parameter estimation con-
vergence are assured. A systematic procedure to de-
termine appropriate combination of parameters em-
bedded in the weighing matrices of Lyapunov 
function is suggested.

MODEL REFERENCE ADAPTIVE STRUCTURAL CONTROL  
ON UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS

SUMMARY 
 
With the rapid application of digital apparatus and the wide usage of PC-based controllers, the 
application of adaptive control technique becomes the focus of automatic control practicing 
engineers and researchers recently. However, its application on civil infrastructures is not well 
established, especially, by taking the advantage of overcoming parameter uncertainty commonly 
encountered on the structural vibration control. An adaptive control application based on 
Lyapunov theory is presented herein. The Lyapunov equation used to define the adaptation law is 
designed based on a quadratic Lyapunov function candidate. This energy-like scalar function 
comprises weighted tracking-error states and parameter-estimating-error matrix. The adaptive 
feedback control force is calculated from both measured states and adjustable parameters 
estimated from the adaptation law. The error states illustrate the trajectory tracking performance 
between reference model and controlled system. The global asymptotical stability is guaranteed 
by choosing a positive definite adaptation weighting matrix for the time-invariant linear system. 
With the time varying adaptation control force, a simple single-degree-of-freedom model with 
parameter uncertainty is used to demonstrate the control performance based on a pre-selected 
target reference model. The advantage of a model-reference adaptive structural control (MRASC) 
algorithm is to adjust the control command signal while estimating the system’s parameters of the 
controlled structure in real time. The control performance of this MRASC system is verified and 
compared by using the El Centro earthquake records. The results show that even with parameter 
uncertainty, the MRASC system can reach the expected control performance of the pre-designed 
reference model.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Adaptive control involves modifying the control law used by a controller to cope with the fact that the 
parameters of the system being controlled are slowly time-varying or uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, 
its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; we need a control law that adapts itself to such 
changing conditions. Adaptive control is different from robust control in the sense that it does not need a priori 
information about the bounds on these uncertain or time-varying parameters; robust control guarantees that if the 
changes are within given bounds the control law need not be changed, while adaptive control is precisely 
concerned with control law changes. In the traditional structural control framework, researchers usually design 
time-invariant active control gains based upon minimization of total energy or performance index and implement 
these control gains through feedback scheme to improve the vibration suppression ability (Soong, 1990; Chu et 
al., 2005). However, for adaptive control, the time-varying adjustable parameters are generally integrated from 
parametric adaptation rule, which is designed using direct Lyapunov method in order to achieve asymptotically 
perfect tracking performance (Slotine and Li, 1991; Åström and Wittenmark, 1995). The basic idea of a Model-

Equation of Motion of the Reference Model 
 
According to the concept of model-reference adaptive structural control, a reference model is designed to specify 
the improved performance of the controlled system subjected to the same earthquake excitation. The purpose of 
this reference model is to generate the desired structural responses (ideal trajectories) that will be tracked by the 
controlled system during the complete episode of earthquake. The choice of the reference model is part of the 
adaptive design. It should reflect the control performance specification in the response reduction and should be 
achievable by the MRASC system. There are some inherent constraints on the structure of the reference model. 
Therefore, it is appropriate to design a reference model with similar order and degree of freedom to those of the 
controlled system. Here, we choose a reference model with designed dynamic properties (natural frequency and 
damping ratio) and the same mass matrix as the controlled structure. Its equation of motion can be similarly

reference model, respectively. They are denoted with subscript m, whereas, the corresponding matrices of the 
controlled structure are denoted with subscript p. It is assumed that all poles of the designed reference model are 
located in the left-half plane to ensure the stability of final control performance. 
 
Design of Adaptive Feedback Control Law 
 
The majority of adaptive control researches focus on the feedforwad-feedback control scheme that is impractical 
for the response reduction under earthquake excitations, since the information of the earthquake is unknown 
prior to the activation of control scheme. An adaptive state-feedback control law is proposed here to move the 
poles of the controlled system into its model-reference counterpart with the time-varying adjustable parameters  
( )tθ and the measurements of system states. The adaptive control force ( )tU defined in equation (1) can be 
calculated according to the adaptive control signal ( )tu  as

with the condition of equation (11). Although V& is negative semi-definite at its equilibrium point ( )(0) (0)η ,θ%  
( , )= 0 0 , however, based on the LaSalle’s invariance principle (Barkana, 2005), the desired asymptotically 
perfect tracking is achieved. By applying the Lyapunov’s direct method, the asymptotical stability of the 
proposed Lyapunov candidate function is ensured. With the adaptive controller defined by the control law of 
equation (5) and the adaptation mechanism aforementioned in equation (13), the error state will converge to zero 
as the control process starts. A few numerical investigation cases are performed to illustrate its performance on 
systems with uncertain parameters. 
 
NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS  
 
SDOF active-tendon model and MRASC controller design 
 
In this study, a systematic investigation is conducted on a single-degree-of-freedom structure, shown in Figure 2, 
subjected to the 1940 El Centro earthquake (Figure 3) to demonstrate the control performance of MRASC on 
systems with parameter uncertainty. An idealized SDOF active tendon system with mass, m = 2922.1 kg, natural 
frequency, pω = 2.5 Hz, and damping ratio, pζ = 1.24%, as shown in Figure 2 (Chu and Chang, 2004). The 
adaptive control force U( )t = 4 cos ( )ck u tα  can be generated through the movement of actuator connected to 
pre-stress tendons, where ck = 371910 N/m, and 36α = o  are the stiffness and inclination angle of the tendons, 
respectively. Also, we choose a reference model with natural frequency, mω = 3.52 Hz, and damping ratio, 
mζ = 11.66%.

Due to the non-linearity of the proposed adaptive scheme, the control effectiveness and tracking performance are 
obviously dependent on the selection of control parameters as well as the types of input excitation. The 
procedures for selecting appropriate adaptation weighing coefficients are investigated and proposed based 
uniformly distributed random input and different earthquake excitations by Chu and Lo (2007). In order to fulfill 
the necessary and sufficient condition for the error state system defined by equation (8) to be asymptotically 
stable, a symmetric positive-definite matrix (1000,1000)diag=Q  are chosen and its corresponding 
tracking-error weighting matrix [1.02 97.14]T=2P  can be determined by the Lyapunov equation (11) with the 
knowledge of designed parameters of reference model. Therefore, the relative weighting between displacement 
tracking-error and velocity tracking-error is fixed and the convergence of tracking-error is also guaranteed. From 
equation (11), it can be shown that the relationship between Q  and P  is linear. Moreover, the adaptive rates 
can be simply magnified or diminished solely by adjusting the adaptation weighting coefficients 
1 2( , )diag γ γ=Γ . For fast convergence rate on the adjustable parameters and in the meanwhile preventing initial

To the extreme situation, Case G of scenario 3 demonstrates the condition that both natural frequency and modal 
damping ratio are identified incorrectly. The evolution profiles of time-varying adjustable feedback parameters 
( )d tθ  and ( )v tθ  of Case G are illustrated and compared with Cases A, E, and F in Figure 5 as well. The tracks 
of ( )d tθ  of both Cases E and G overlap as shown in Figure 5(a) and converge to the same ideal value as 
calculated in Table 1; meanwhile, the evolution profiles of ( )v tθ  reach their corresponding ideal value within 5 
seconds after the MRASC controller starts. The ideal adaptive parameters as defined in equation (6) actually 
depend on the difference of stiffness and damping between the controlled system and the reference model. The 
perfect performance on parameters’ convergence demonstrates the robustness of proposed MRASC control 
algorithm and illustrates the feasibility of recommend adaptation weighing coefficients.

Performance on response reduction 
 
Another important issue has to be examined is the control performance on the response reduction if the 
parameters of controlled structure are identified incorrectly. As was pointed out in the beginning of this study, the 
parameter uncertainty due to the accuracy of system identification procedure increases the difficulty in 
estimating the stiffness and damping properties correctly, therefore, it is hard to come up with a so-called optimal 
control design for traditional control algorithms. This limitation can be released since the adaptive control 
requires little or no a priori information about the controlled structure. Since the time-varying adjustable 
feedback-parameters ( )tθ  of Cases A~G estimated in real time through the adaptation mechanism proposed by 
equation (13) converge to their ideal value within 5 seconds as the MRASC controller starts as demonstrated in

incoming technological revolution. The broad but strongly interdisciplinary field of smart 
structures seeks to apply multifunctional capabilities to existing and new structures. Smart 
structures and materials are those that can sense external stimuli and then respond to those 
stimuli by some means in real or near real-time. However, reliability, performance, and life 
cycle costs are the primary concerns for almost all in-service structures such as transportation 
systems, civil infrastructures, mechanical and aerospace systems, medical devices, etc. The 
vision for addressing these concerns is to develop future structures that are capable of 
self-sensing and monitoring, self-diagnosis and prognosis with intelligence, self-healing and 
repair, and adaptive response to prevent loss of human life and catastrophe, to minimize 
maintenance and life-cycle costs, and to prolong service life. 
 
The abstracts and papers presented in this conference are received from authors from 
China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, USA and the rest. My presentation was scheduled in the 
“Morphing Structures and Systems” session from 10:30am ~ 12:30pm in May 26. This 
conference provide a broad forum for professional structural and construction engineers and 
researchers working in Asia and around the world to present recent progress in research and 
development, and to discuss the implementation of new tools and technology in professional 
applications. In particular, this conference also promotes mutual understanding and shares 
common ideas.

2 MODEL-REFERENCE ADAPTIVE 
STRUCTURAL CONTROL (MRASC) 
ALGOTRITHM UNDER EARTHQUAKE 
EXCITATION 
2.1 Equation of Motion of MRASC Controlled 
Systems 
The block diagram of a model-reference adaptive 
structural control (MRASC) system is shown in Fig-
ure 1. It is composed of four parts: a controlled 
structure containing unknown parameters, a refer-
ence model structure for specifying the desired out-
put of the controlled structure, an adaptive controller 
to generate feedback control force based on system 
states and adjustable parameters, and an adaptation 
mechanism (defined as the adaptation loop) for up-
dating the adjustable parameters. To gain insights 
about the behavior of the MRASC systems and also 
to avoid mathematical complexity, we assume the 
unknown parameters of the controlled structure are 
constant. In practice, the MRASC algorithm is often 
used to handle time-varying unknown parameters.

For illustration purpose without loosing its gen-
eralization, we apply this MRASC algorithm to a 
linear time-invariant system subjected to earthquake 
excitation as follow,

In equation (1)，M , pC , and pK are the nn×  
mass, damping, and stiffness matrices; ( )p tx , 
( )p tx , and ( )p tx  are the 1n×  relative displace-
ment, velocity, and acceleration vectors. 
( ) ( )t t=U τu  is the 1m×  adaptive control force 
vector distributed by the mn×  controller location 
matrix 2b , among which ( )idiag τ=τ  ( 1i m= ∼ ) 
is the m m×  diagonal matrix, and ( )tu  is the 
1m×  adaptive control signal vector. In practical 
application, iτ  is the scaling constant between the 
control force and the adaptive control signal of the i-
th controller. Due to earthquake acceleration excita-
tion ( )gx t , )(txgMh− is the 1×n  equivalent iner-
tia force distributed by the 1×n  influence vector

are the 2 1n×  state vector, the 2 2n n×  controlled 
system matrix, the 2n m×  controller location ma-

respectively.  
2.2 Equation of Motion of the Reference Model 
According to the concept of model-reference adap-
tive structural control, reference model is to generate 
the desired structural responses (ideal trajectories) 
that will be tracked by the controlled system during 
the complete episode of an earthquake. Here, we 
choose a reference model with designed dynamic 
properties (natural frequencies and damping ratios) 
and the known mass matrix. Its equation of motion 
can be similarly formulated as

are the 2 1n×  state vector, the 2 2n n×  system ma-
trix, and the 2 1n×  external loading location matrix 
of the reference model, respectively. They are de-
noted with subscript m, whereas, the corresponding 
matrices of the controlled structure are denoted with 
subscript p. 
2.3 Design of Adaptive Feedback Control Law 
An adaptive state-feedback control law is proposed 
here to move the poles of the controlled system into 
its model-reference counterpart with the time-
varying adjustable parameters and the measurements 
of system states. The adaptive control force ( )tU  
defined in equation (1) can be calculated according 
to the adaptive control signal ( )tu  as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )T pt t t t=U τu = τ θ X  (5) 
where ( ) ( ) ( )T T Td vt t t⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦θ = θ θ  is the 2m n×  time-
3 CONTROL PERFORMANCE OF MRASC 
Due to the non-linearity of the proposed adaptive 
scheme, the control effectiveness and tracking per-
formance are obviously dependent on the selection 
of control parameters as well as the types of input 
excitation. In the absence of modeling errors, the 
previous adaptive laws assure parameters conver-
gence of the adjustable parameter vector ( )tθ to the 
ideal value *θ  provided that the input excitation is 
persistently exciting. (Ioannou & Datta 1991).   
However, some restrictions should be applied on the 
selection of adaptation weighting matrices P  and 
Γ , which dominate the scalar function of 
Lyapunov’s direct method. In this study, a system-
atic investigation is conducted firstly on a single de-
gree-of-freedom structure, shown in Figure 2, sub-
jected to a uniformly distributed random excitation 
to demonstrate their influence. The appropriate 
choice on these parameters is recommended for fast 
convergence rate. Secondly, the ground acceleration 
record of 1940 El Centro earthquake (N-S compo-
nent), shown in Figure 3, is used as the base excita-
tion for performance verification.

3.1 Procedures for Selecting Appropriate 
Adaptation Parameters 
An idealized SDOF active tendon system with mass, 
m = 2922.1 kg, natural frequency, pω = 2.5 Hz, and 
damping ratio, pζ = 1.24%, as shown in Figure 
2(Chu et al. 2004). The adaptive control force 
U( )t =  4 cos ( )ck u tα  can be generated through the 
movement of actuator connected to pre-stress ten-
dons, where ck = 371910 N/m, and 36α = D  are the 
stiffness and inclination angle of the tendons, re-
spectively. Also, we choose a reference model with 
natural frequency, mω = 3.52 Hz, and damping ratio, 
mζ = 11.66%. 
In order to fulfill the asymptotically stability 
requirement, the adaptation mechanism derived in 
equation (15) must be applied in real-time to adjust 
the adaptive control signal correspondingly. For a 
SDOF system, its adaptation weighting matrix re-
lated to the parameter estimation error can be de-
fined as

provided that the system state and tracking error 
state are defined according to equations (2) and (7). 
For the given parameters of the designed reference 
model, the adaptation weighting matrix correspond-
ing to tracking errors is

Equation (18) illustrates the relevant factors 
that will contribute to the convergence rates of cor-
responding adjustable parameters. 12P  and 22P  de-
termine the weighting between displacement track-
ing error and velocity tracking error, whereas 1γ  
and 2γ  dominate the adaptive rates directly. With 
so many controlling factors involved in the design of 
adaptation law, few suggested design rules are given 
in the referred articles. A preliminary study (Chu et 
al. 2004) is conducted by varying those parameters 
individually and shows that the combined adaptive 
rate will dominate the performance of a MRASC 
system. 
First of all, a necessary and sufficient condition 
for the error state system defined by equation (8) to 
be asymptotically stable is that, for any symmetric 
positive definite matrix Q, the unique matrix P , 
solution of the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov equation 
(12), be symmetric positive definite. (Slotine & Li 
1991). For demonstration, we choose a symmetric 
positive definite
