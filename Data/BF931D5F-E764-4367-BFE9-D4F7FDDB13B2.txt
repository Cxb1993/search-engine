1I. INTRODUCTION
The problem of multicasting is to efficiently distribute com-
mon information to a group of receivers. Typical applications
include multimedia streaming and the distribution of software.
Recently, it is found that coding techniques can be used
for increasing the efficiency of multicasting in two different
directions. First, the transmission rate of multicasiting can be
increased remarkably and it can be shown to reach optimality
if the intermediate nodes can do “network coding”, not just
store-and-forward([1], [6]). The other direction, the focus of
this paper, is to use an erasure code (also called FEC (Forward
Error Correction) in the literature) to speed up the multicasting
process. The sender uses an erasure code to map a group of
message packets onto a larger set of check packets so that any
receiver can decode the original group of message packets after
receiving a sufficient number of these check packets. The main
advantage of using erasure codes in the multicasting process
is that the transmission of check packets can correct different
loss patterns among the receivers. Hence a little more check
packets can result in much more reliable receivers without
causing excessive retransmissions(see e.g.,[11]).
More recently, rateless erasure codes have been applied in
multicasting for efficient content distribution(see e.g., [2], [10],
[9]). The rate of an erasure code is defined as the ratio of the
number of message packets to the number of check packets.
With a fixed-rate erasure code, if the sender has transmitted
all the check packets and there are still receivers that have not
received enough packets to decode all the original message
packets, the sender may have to retransmit the check packets.
This is not very efficient because the receivers could receive
packets which were already received before. With a rateless
code, the encoder can map a group of n message packets to
a set of check packets whose size is exponential in n([8],
[12]). Hence, with a rateless erasure code, the sender virtually
will not use up the check packets and can avoid the packet
retransmission. Motivated by providing theoretical justification
for this more efficient scheme, we continue the approach in
[7] and relax the assumption that the erasure code has a fixed
code rate.
In what follows, we first consider a direct multicasting
model using rateless erasure codes in Section II and obtain
a strong law of large numbers for the asymptotic throughput.
Several numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate
the usage of the throughput equation and comparisons with
the results in [7] are made to demonstrate the advantage of
using rateless erasure codes instead of using fixed-rate earsure
codes. The formal proof of the strong law is given in Section
III. In Section IV, we further extend the results in Section II
to the model with one common shared link . Finally, simple
conclusions are made in Section V.
II. THE ASYMPTOTIC THROUGHPUT OF THE DIRECT
MULTICASTING MODEL
We make the following assumptions for the direct multicas-
ting model (see Figure 1).
(A1) There is an ideal rateless erasure code which can map
a group of n message packets on to an arbitrarily
lager set of check packets. The sender transmits
these check packets one by one, and any receiver
can decode the original n message packets once he
has successfully received any collection of κn check
packets for some κ ≥ 1.
(A2) There are one sender and rn receivers for some
r > 1. The sender sends fixed size packets to the
receivers. Packets to the receivers are lost indepen-
dently with probability q < 1.

Fig. 1. The direct multicasting model
Assumption (A1) is a somewhat simplified assumption when
considering practical rateless erasure codes. In fact, rateless
codes can map a group of n message packets to a set of check
packets whose size is exponential in n, not arbitrary. This is
not a problem since we want to prove a nonzero asymptotic
throughput which should not consume exponentially many
check packets. Also practically, a receiver can decode all the
original message packets after he has received a collection of
slightly more than n check packets([8], [12]), not exactly κn
check packets. This also is not a problem theoretically, since
we can change the value of parameter κ to obtain the upper
bound and lower bound of the practical asymptotic throughput.
In our model, there are three key parameters: the ratio of the
number of check packets to the number of message packets
for successful decoding κ, the packet loss probability q, and
the exponent coefficient of the number of receivers log r. We
want to show in this section how these three parameters affect
the throughput of the multicasting problem when n is large.
To be precise, let T (n) be the number of packets sent by the
sender until all the receivers receive at least κn packets. Then
we can define the throughput of the sender S(n) as the ratio of
the number of message packets to the number of transmitted
packets, i.e.,
S(n) =
n
T (n)
. (1)
One of our main results is a strong law of large numbers
that shows S(n) converging to an asymptotic throughput S
when n → ∞. The asymptotic throughput S is characterized
by the unique solution of an equation in terms of the three
key parameters κ, q and log r.
In Theorem 1, we prove a strong law of large numbers
for the asymptotic throughput. The strong law shows how the
3(iv) For 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α),
Λ∗(γ, α) = αD(
γ
α
‖1− q) > 0. (8)
(v) For a fixed 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α) = α(1 − q), Λ∗(γ, α)
is continuous in α > 0.
(vi) For a fixed 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α) = α(1 − q), if
Λ∗(γ, α) > 0, then Λ∗(γ, α) is strictly increasing
in α > 0.
(vii) For a fixed 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α) = α(1− q),
lim
α→∞Λ
∗(γ, α) =∞.
Proof. (i) Obviously, Λ(θ, α) in (2) is continuous in α.
(ii) This is also obvious since log((1 − q)eθ + q) < 0 for
θ < 0.
(iii) Note that
Λ′(θ, α) = α
(1− q)eθ
(1− q)eθ + q (9)
is strictly increasing in θ and Λ′(0, α) = α(1− q). Thus, for
γ ≥ Λ′(0, α), the function θγ − Λ(θ, α) is increasing in θ
for all θ ≤ 0 and thus its maximum occurs at θ = 0. This
leads to Λ∗(γ, α) = 0γ−Λ(0, α) = 0 for all γ < Λ′(0, α) (as
Λ(0, α) = 0).
(iv) For 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α), the maximum of the function
θγ − Λ(θ, α) occurs uniquely at a negative θ(γ, α) , which
can be easily obtained from solving θ in the equation
Λ′(θ, α) = γ.
In fact, we can obtain that
θ(γ, α) = log(
γ
α− γ
q
1− q ).
Hence, after some algebraic operations, we get
Λ∗(γ, α) = θ(γ, α)γ − Λ(θ(γ, α), α) = αD(γ
α
‖1− q).
As the maximum is unique,
Λ∗(γ, α) > Λ∗(Λ′(0, α), α) = 0
for 0 < γ < Λ′(0, α).
(v) This is obvious from (iv).
(vi) From (3), (ii),(iv), it follows that for any ² > 0
Λ∗(γ, α+ ²) ≥ θ(γ, α)γ − Λ(θ(γ, α), α+ ²)
> θ(γ, α)γ − Λ(θ(γ, α), α)
= Λ∗(γ, α). (10)
It remains to show that
Λ∗(γ, α− ²) < Λ∗(γ, α). (11)
If Λ∗(γ, α − ²) = 0, then (11) holds trivially as Λ∗(γ, α) >
0. On the other hand, if Λ∗(γ, α − ²) > 0, we can use the
argument in (10) to show (11).
(vii) Since Λ∗(γ, α) ≥ θγ −Λ(θ, α) for all θ ≤ 0, we have
from (i) that for all θ ≤ 0
lim
α→∞Λ
∗(γ, α) ≥ θγ − lim
α→∞Λ(θ, α) = θγ − (−∞) =∞.
Now we first show the solution in (7) is unique in the
following lemma.
Lemma 3 For r > 1 , there is a unique solution S of (7).
Moreover, 0 < S < (1− q)/κ.
Proof. The existence of a unique solution follows from
Lemma 2 (v), (vi) and (vii). That S > 0 is trivial as
limα→∞ Λ∗(κ, α) = ∞. To prove S < (1 − q)/κ, it suffices
to note that Λ∗(κ, κ1−q ) = 0.
Let Zi(m), i = 1, . . . , rn, be the indicator random variable
for the event that the ith receiver has succesfully received the
mth packet when m packets are sent by the sender. Also, let
Yi(α) =
∑bαc
m=1 Zi(m) be the number of packets that have
been received by the ith receiver after bαc packets are sent by
the sender. As T (n) is the number of packets that the sender
sends to ensure all the receivers receive at least κn check
packets, we then have
T (n) = inf{m : min
1≤i≤rn
[Yi(m)] ≥ κn}. (12)
In the following lemma, we use the large deviation bounds to
derive some probabilistic bounds that will be used in the proof
of Theorem 1.

where Λ∗(γ, α) is defined in (3).
(iii) If γ < Λ′(0, α), then for every ² > 0, there exists an
n0 <∞ such that for all n ≥ n0
P(Y1(αn) < γn) ≥ exp
(
−n(Λ∗(γ, α)+²)
)
. (15)
(iv) If γ < Λ′(0, α), then for every ² > 0, there exists an
n0 <∞ such that for all n ≥ n0
logP( min
1≤i≤rn
[Yi(αn)] ≥ γn)
≤ − exp
(
n(log r − Λ∗(γ, α)− ²)
)
. (16)
Proof. (i) Without loss of generality, assume that αn is an
integer. As packets are lost independently and P(Zi(m) =
1) = 1− q ,
Yi(αn) =
αn∑
m=1
Zi(m) (17)
is simply the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables.
Computing the moment generating function of Yi(αn) yields
the desired result.
5IV. MULTICASTING WITH ONE COMMON SHARED LINK
In this section, we extend our result to multicasting with
one common shared link (see Figure 4). We make the same
assumptions as in Section II except that each packet from the
sender to a receiver has to go through one shared link and
one dedicated link. This model corresponds to mutlicasting
via a satellite in [5]. The sender first sends packets to the
satellite and the satellite then broadcasts the packets back
to the receivers. Assume that packets are lost independently
with probability q1 on the shared link and with the same
probability q2 on all the dedicated links. Also, we assume
that the intermediate node is transparent in the sense that it
simply relays every packet (it receives from the sender) on
all the dedicated links. As in Section II, we show that there
is a strong law for the asymptotic throughput of the sender.
Let T˜ (n) be the minimum number of packets transmitted by
the sender so that all the receivers receive at least κn distinct
packets. Similarly, define S˜ = n
T˜ (n)
to be the throughput of
the sender.

Theorem 5 Let
Λ˜(θ, α) = α(1− q1) log((1− q2)eθ + q2), α > 0. (24)
Also, let
Λ˜∗(γ, α) = sup
θ≤0
[θγ − Λ˜(θ, α)], (25)
be the one-sided Legendre transform of Λ˜(θ, α). Then for γ <
α(1− q1)(1− q2),
Λ˜∗(γ, α) = α(1− q1)D( γ
α(1− q1)‖1− q2), (26)
and
lim
n→∞S(n) = S, a.s., (27)
where 0 < S < (1 − q1)(1 − q2)/κ is the unique solution of
the following equation
Λ˜∗(κ,
1
S
) = log r. (28)
The proof for Theorem 5 is based on the fact that when
conditioning on the transmission result of the shared link, the
spatial loss correlation between receivers can be removed. As
such, we can then apply the methods used for the proof of
Theorem 1.
To ease our presentation, we call the model in Section II
the direct multicasting model and the model in this section
the satellite model. Let N(αn) be the random variable repre-
senting the number of packets that are successfully transmitted
on the shared link after the sender sends bαnc packets in the
satellite model. Denote by Y˜i(αn) the number of packets that
are successfully received by the ith receiver after the sender
sends bαnc packets in the satellite model. Let Yi(γn) be the
number of packets that are successfully received by the ith
receiver after γn packets are sent in the direct multicasting
model. Then conditioning on the transmission result at the
shared link N(αn) = γn, we have
Y˜i(αn) = Yi(γn). (29)
Once we establish the connection between these two mod-
els, the rest of the proof of Theorem 5 can be argued
heuristically in the following two steps. First, observe that
N(αn)/n converges to α(1− q1) almost surely by the strong
law of large numbers. Moreover, the probability that N(αn)/n
deviates from α(1 − q1) is exponentially small by the large
deviation principle. Intuitively, when n is large, the outcome
at the shared link is almost deterministic and it is near
α(1 − q1)n. The second step is then to reduce the satellite
model to the direct multicasting model by conditioning on
N(αn)
n = α(1− q1). Hence we can apply the same method in
the proof of Theorem 1 to obtain probabilistic bounds under
the condition that N(αn) = α(1− q1)n. The formal proof of
Theorem 5 is omitted here due to space limitation.
Note that Theorem 1 becomes a special case in Theorem
5 with q1 = 0 and q2 = q. To gain more insights between
these two models, we present several numerical results for the
asymptotic results in Theorem 1 and Theorem 5. In Figure 5,
we choose q1 = 0.05, q2 = 1/19 in Theorem 5 and choose
q = 0.1 in Theorem 1. By so doing, the (end-to-end) packet
loss probabilities are the same as q = q1+q2−q1q2 = 0.1. As
shown in Figure 5, the asymptotic throughput in the satellite
model link is always better than that in the direct multicasting
model when log r is kept the same.
In Figure 6, we vary the loss probability q1 on the shared
link, but keep the end-to-end packet loss probability fixed by
choosing q2 with q1 + q2 − q1q2 = 0.1. As q1 → 0, the
model becomes the direct multicasting model. On the other
hand, as q1 → 0.1 (q2 → 0), it becomes a single link model.
Thus, increasing q1 increases the spatial loss dependency. As
shown in Figure 6, the asymptotic throughput S˜ increases as
q1 increases. This shows that the spatial correlation increases
the asymptotic throughput of a multicast system and displays
the same phenomena as the fixed-rate scheme in [7].
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this project, we consider two multicasting models that use
rateless erasure codes, and prove several strong laws of large
numbers for the asymptotic throughput. Several numerical
experiments are performed to demonstrate the usage of these
asymptotic throughput equations. These strong laws not only
provide rigorous justification for using rateless erasure codes
in the multicasting process, but also may be used to shed light
on some phenomena in the multicasting process.
