2Different control schemes were proposed to attack the piezo-actuated system. Among these,
Choi et al. [1] designed a sliding-mode controller for fine motion tracking control of the objective
lens in vertical direction. Lin and Yang [2] employed a PI feedback control together with an
observer-based feedforward compensation to overcome the nonlinearity of the PA. Bashash and
Jalili [3], on the other hand, proposed a modelling and control methodology for real-time
compensation of nonlinearities along with precision trajectory control of PAs in various range of
frequency operation. Liaw et al. [4] presented a robust motion tracking control methodology for
flexure-based four-bar micro/nano manipulator driven by a PA. Other control techniques involving
feedback and feedforward-feedback features have also been proposed to remove the
hysteresis-caused tracking error [5-9]. Usually, the feedback control techniques do not utilize a
precise hysteresis model. In contrast, the feedforward-feedback algorithms deal with the hysteresis
and structural dynamics separately, i.e., apply a compensator in the feedforward loop to cancel out
the undesired effects caused by the hysteresis while design a feedback controller to control the
structural dynamic effect. Although the feedforward compensator can deal with nonlinear hysteretic
effects, the effectiveness of the method relies heavily on the accuracy of the inverse hysteresis
model.
A model-free FAT-based adaptive sliding-mode controller is employed in this study to cope with
the piezoelectric control problem without detailed knowledge of the system. FAT has been
successfully utilized to design adaptive sliding-mode controller for different nonlinear systems
containing unknown time-varying uncertainties [10-12]. Usually, the unknown uncertainties are
represented by using a finite combination of orthogonal basis functions, which in this case are Haar
wavelets, with unknown constant coefficients. Compared to other bases such as Fourier basis,
wavelet basis possesses the localization and multi-resolution properties, which is advantageous in
dealing with time-varying signal processing. Furthermore, Haar wavelet has simple, analytical
expression, with only finite number of values on certain bounded time domain. Such a property
greatly increases the computation efficiency that is especially important in implementing control
algorithms on a real system. Thus, Haar wavelet rather than Fourier basis is selected in
implementing the FAT here. Appropriate update laws for the weighting coefficients of Haar series
can be selected based on the Lyapunov stability theory to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop
system. Asymptotic convergence of the output error can even be assured if a sufficient number of
orthogonal basis functions have been adopted.

In order to validate the effectiveness of the models shown above, the same PRBS were sent to

in the sense that they can capture most of the system dynamics. The fitting percentages, for X and Y
axis, are both larger than 90. These models will be applied for the design of sliding mode controller
(SMC) afterwards.

elaborated in the next section.
4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to examine the feasibility of the proposed method, two control trajectories are adopted.
These include a circular (20 mm diameter) and a window (width, 16 mm) contour. Control
parameters selected for these trajectories and the FAT-based adaptive sliding controller are listed in
Table 1 while those for the SMC are presented in Table 2. 16 Haar basis were adopted in
implementing the FAT-based method in which the sampling rate was chosen as 2,000 Hz. gm was
chosen as 10,000 while the weighting coefficients are updated at each sampled time step in order to
capture the system dynamics.
When conducting the experiments, control parameters of SMC were tuned to an extent at which
the best tracking performances were obtained while chattering phenomenon was avoided. In other
words, parameter values larger than those listed in Table 2 could induce chattering. In contrast,
control parameters for the FAT-based method were tuned so that best performances can be achieved.
Based on these parameters, tracking experiments focusing on the circular path were carried out and
results are presented in Figures 5-9 and Table 3. In this case, the desired motions are sinusoidal so
that the resultant trajectory is a 20-mm circle. It can be seen in Figs. 5-7 that proper control
performance can be obtained regardless the presence of the time-varying uncertainty. The control
input corresponding to this case is presented in Fig. 8 while the comparison between performances
of the SMC and the proposed FAT-based ASMC are listed in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3
that the proposed method evidently outperforms the traditional SMC. For example, the largest
tracking error of the SMC is about 2.1% while that of the proposed method is 0.2%. When the root

Although simulation results, presented in Figs. 2 and 3, more-or-less indicate the reliability of
the identified model depicted in Eq. (2) and (3), chattering phenomenon which features the
traditional SMC deteriorates its control performance when a real system is facing. In contrast, the
FAT-based ASMC approximates the system uncertainty well so that better tracking performance
can be achieved. When the window contour is of concerned, comparison between the desired
trajectories and the control output are presented in Figs. 10 and 11, whereas the tracking errors
associated with the SMC and the proposed method are shown in Fig. 12. Furthermore, Fig. 13
illustrates features of the control inputs of the X and Y axis while Fig. 14 demonstrates the estimate
of the system dynamics in the window-contour case.

輪箱之噪音與振動預測與控制等。
本年度研討會除了大會專題演講之外，其他論文發表分三天半同時進行 16
個場次超過七百多篇之論文發表，並且有連續三天超過 30 家之振動噪音量測設
備廠商參展，就發表論文內容之綜合分析如下：
1.本次會議分為 45 個 Structured Sessions (SS)以及 56 個 Regular Sessions
(RS)，其中 SS 係由各領域專家主動組織形成，RS 為大會依照發表論文主
題組織規劃。
2.主動振動與噪音控制(active sound and vibration control)是傳統主題之一，有
相當多類別的論文，應用領域也相當廣，諸如鐵路振動噪音、智慧型材料
結構等，筆者即參加此主題之發表會。
3.在機器診斷與健康監測，除了有一場專題演講，也有多個場次於失效診斷
(failure diagnosis)、狀態監控(condition monitoring)、結構健康監測(health
monitoring)等。
4.本屆之場次如同以往，從天上飛的航空器，地上的鐵路、汽車、建築物、
橋樑，到海上船舶等，都有振動與噪音相關主題之技術報告。
另外，大會也依慣例安排儀器設備廠商參展，由於 ICSV 已經舉辦 16 屆已
經是振動噪音領域極其重要的研討會之一，集聚世界各地的產、學界人士，因此
參展的廠商不僅踴躍超過 30 家，也有相當的排場。本次大會將 B&K 及 Polytec
兩大廠分列為金獎及銀獎贊助商。今年度大會安排的場地，大致能維持過去的水
準，美中不足之處為各場地相當分散，與會者必須走不少路，因此在場地更換時
較為不方便。另外用餐處所太少，導致用餐時需苦候多時，亦為另與會人士詬病
之處。
筆者也抽空由大會安排參觀當地著名的Wieliczka Salt Mine鹽礦，到達深入
地底下 135公尺，令人嘆為觀止。也參訪位於 Auschwitz-Birkenauy在二次大戰期
間納粹之集中營，回顧令人髮指之不堪回首的悲慘歷史，讓人更加深思人類平等
價值與自由民主之可貴。第三天的大會也依例舉行晚宴中，除了筆者還有台北科
大李春穎教授、大葉大學林海平教授、羅正忠教授、張舜長教授、屏東科技大學
王柏村教授以及中央大學吳炤民教授，共 7位也形成一個團體。另外也遇到一位
清華大學博士生及工研院材料所人員，根據資料顯示，台灣共有 11 篇論文及 11
位發表人，在各國數量排名第 19，在亞洲國家論文發表數，次於南韓(51)、日本
(44)、中國(21)及伊朗(12)。
四. 與會心得
ICSV 研討會可以說是振動噪音領域最重要的學術研討會之一，本年度參加
ICSV 的與會人士以當地波蘭人最多，鄰近的英國及德國分居第二、第三，南韓
則為第四，日本為第五，台灣總計有 11 位教授、學者及博士生與會，據大會統
計共有 53 個國家人士參與，顯見聲音振動在各國研究受重視的程度。就筆者在
本次研討會的綜合觀察如下：
1.由振動噪音儀器設備廠商參展踴躍及展示內容的盛況，可以看出廠商對
ICSV研討會的重視，同時也深知與會人士對振動噪音儀器設備應用的廣大
