摘要 
本研究發展出一精確的掉落測試壽命評估理論與方法，本分析流程可應用在具應力緩衝層晶圓級封裝的
金屬導線可靠度分析。這個封裝結構添加了一層較厚的應力緩衝層來吸收衝擊波以保護錫球接點，但若
設計不當將使破壞機制移轉至金屬導線。這種破壞機制並不常見於一般的封裝結構，因此其相關破壞評
估理論尚未健全。如何發展出一能精確預估導現在受衝擊下的壽命，為今日先進封裝結構所迫切需要。 
 
1. Introduction 
Accompanying the increasing 
popularity of portable and handheld 
products, high reliability and high 
resistance of drop impact capability 
of handheld products becomes a 
great concern for semiconductor 
and electronic product 
manufacturers. It is more and more 
important to study the dynamic 
response of packages during the 
mechanical shock caused by 
customer usage in portable devices 
and mobile applications. In line 
with this, the board level drop-test 
regulations formed by JEDEC [1], 
[2] were published to assess drop 
performance for surface mounted 
IC package. 
About the study of board level 
drop test, several researches have 
been published. Tee et al. [3] 
proposed “Input-G method” to 
reduce the huge computation 
amount of drop test simulation. The 
input-G method ignores the drop 
table, fixture and contact surface, 
and instead, the impact pulse is 
taken as input acceleration loading 
at 4 screws of test board. Chiang et 
al. [4] proposed “Modified Input-G 
method”, which considered the 
effect of screw tightness. The 
residule stress caused by tight 
screw condition was applied on the 
test board. Results showed that the 
drop performance was lowered 
when the screw tightness became 
worse. However, few studies 
mentioned about the life prediction 
model for board level drop test. 
Because of the highly uncertainty 
of the drop test and the lack of 
precise simulation model, it is 
difficult to develop a stable life 
prediction model with good 
experimental correlation. Tee et al. 
[5] proposed impact life prediction 
model using the maximum peeling 
stress of critical solder as failure 
criteria to determine the drop life of 
packages. Results showed that the 
characteristic impact life is a more 
consistent parameter compared 
with first-failure life, as the process 
and testing variation is minimized 
through averaging test data. 
In this research, the 
board-level drop test, failure 
analysis, dynamic simulation, and 
impact life prediction model are 
established. Afterward, the 
structural optimal design is carried 
out to improve the drop test 
performance of packages. The 
stress-buffer-enhanced package 
 
Because the failure mode of 
stress-buffer-enhanced package 
focused on the fatigued metal traces, 
the configuration of trace layout 
becomes a significant factor 
affecting the impact reliability of 
this package. Therefore, two kinds 
of trace layout, the straight trace 
and the curved trace, were then 
experimented. The fatigued metal 
trace failures were recorded as 
shown in Fig. 3. And the 
experimental results were listed in 
Table 1. In Table 1, P1 represented 
packages pass 90 drops, while P2 
represented packages pass 240 
drops. Interestingly, the failure 
occurred in the order of U1, U11, 
U5, and U15. The experimental 
resut is caused by the asymmetric 
configuration of solder joints and 
trace layout, shown in Fig. 4. 
Figure 4 shows the straight trace 
layout which has sparse solder 
joints at bottom-left corner. The U1 
package has relatively the shortest 
distance between the sparse solder 
joint area and the fixed screw. As a 
result, the impact wave from the 
screw attacks the weak sparse area 
directly, causing the first failure of 
U1 package. Therefore, in this 
research, we assume that every 
position of the packages, i.e. U1, 
U2, …, U15, should be treated as 
an individual experiment during 
board level drop test, even though 
they are all mounted on the same 
test board.

For ensuring the accuracy of 
dynamic simulations, the 
experimental validation with 
simulation result was performed. 
The acceleration of package U15 
(package side) was validated in this 
study. Because package U15, the 
detailed model, was chosen as the 
correlation of life prediction model, 
the more accurate of the simulation 
result of package U15, the more 
reliable of the impact life prediction 
model. Figure 8 shows the 
acceleration validation of package 
U15. The validation shows good 
agreement between experimental 
data and simulation result. Based 
on the simulation results, the 
development of life prediction 
model was made as described in the 
following section.

4. Impact Life Prediction Model 
In order to quantitatively 
estimate the impact performance of 
packages, five drop experiments, 2 
straight trace layout and 3 curved 
trace layout, were selected to 
construct the related finite element 
model as shown in Fig. 9. 
According to the aforementioned 
experimental results, every position 
of the packages, i.e. U1, U2, …, 
U15, should be treated as an 
individual experiment during board 
level drop test due to their 
asymmetric trace layout and solder 
joint distribution. Case1 and case2 
represented models of straight trace 
layout at different position, U1 and 
U15. Case3, case4 and case5 
represented models of curved trace 
layout at different position; 
especially, case5 has a thinner 
dielectric layer. Besides, in order to 
decrease the computation amount, 
all the five cases only have one 
critical trace where the failure was 
frequently observed in drop 
experiments, shown in Fig. 9. 
All the simulations were 
conducted from 0ms to 6ms, which 
represented the period of the 
fundamental natural vibration of 
test board. The simulation results 
are shown in Fig. 10. Results show 
chosen to be the predicted models 
using the anterior correlation 
parameters. Table2 list the 
prediction results. The 
characteristic life in Table 2 was 
obtained using Weibull distribution. 
Results show that there is a good 
correlation for impact life 
prediction model. Accordingly, the 
cumulative plastic strain is suitable 
for the impact life prediction model, 
because the failure of drop test 
belongs to low cycle fatigue which 
is dominated by plastic strain.

on horizontal S-type traces are 
shearing loading, while they are 
bending loading on vertical S-type 
traces. The S-type trace layout 
provides extra buffers when the traces 
are deformed by the solder joints and 
dielectric layer during drop impact. 
The simulation results also indicate 
that the plastic strain of S-type trace 
layout only occurs at the neck area 
between trace and pad. The S-type 
trace layout can release lots of stress 
concentration because of its high 
flexibility. Figure 14 shows the plastic 
strain propagation of traces. The 
maximum plastic strains of S-type 
traces are all smaller than that of 
I-type traces.

z Sandwich Structure Design 
The stress-buffer-enhanced 
package provides a good stress buffer 
to protect the solder joint. However, 
the deformation of soft dielectric 
layer becomes much larger than the 
conventional wafer level package. 
The metal trace embedded in the 
dielectric layer becomes a dangerous 
portion during drop impact. For a 
compromise between the reliabilities 
of solder joint and trace line, the 
“sandwich structure” is proposed as a 
structural improvement for the 
stress-buffer-enhanced package, 
shown in Fig. 15. The so-called 
sandwich structure is to laminate one 
more lamination on the top of stress 
buffer. This lamination is a dielectric 
layer with much higher Young’s 
modulus, such as PI, BCB materials.

Fig. 14: Illustration of sandwich structure 
 
Figure 15 shows the 
comparison of plastic strain at trace 
between stress-buffer-enhanced 
package and sandwich structure. One 
can observed that the plastic train of 
sandwich structure is much reduced. 
The trace of sandwich structure 
reveals brilliant reliability because the 
PI layer can “hold” the stress buffer 
from large deformation. For the 
inspection of solder joint reliability, 
the solder joint is well protected 
packages subjected to drop impact. 
Several LS-DYNA simulations were 
conducted to elucidate the mechanical 
behavior of test board and packages. 
After validating the simulation results 
with experimental data, the 
development of impact life prediction 
model were then accomplished. The 
impact life prediction model was 
proposed using the cumulative plastic 
strain as failure criterion related to 
impact life. Results showed that the 
cumulative plastic strain is suitable 
for the impact life prediction model, 
because the failure of drop test 
belongs to low cycle fatigue which is 
dominated by plastic strain. There is 
good correlation between impact life 
predicted by simulations and 
measured by experiments. 
Afterwrds, several 
interconnection designs including 
trace layout design, sandwich 
structure, and chip size /package size 
design are proposed to enhance the 
metal trace reliability. In the trace 
layout design, it is recommended that 
the curved trace layout can release the 
stress concentration. The 
experimental results also indicate the 
curved trace layout is capable to bear 
higher drop numbers. The sandwich 
structure and small chip size design 
are proposed in this research. The 
so-called sandwich structure is to 
laminate one stiffer lamination (PI, 
BCB) on the top of stress buffer. The 
trace of sandwich structure reveals 
brilliant reliability because the PI 
layer can “hold” the stress buffer 
from large deformation. For chip size 
design, the small chip size can 
increase the filler area. The Young’s 
modulus of the filler polymer is 
similar to the dielectric layer, which 
indicates that the filler area is actually 
a big stress buffer with 190μm 
thickness (the thickness of chip layer). 
When traces and solder joints are 
placed outside the chip to the filler 
area, reliabilities of solder joints and 
traces are much improved because the 
filler polymer absorbed a large 
portion of impact energy.

 摘要 
發光二極體由於具有低耗能、使用壽明長與無汞汙染等優點，目前
已被廣泛應用於許多產品上，如紅綠燈、汽車車尾燈與液晶螢幕的背光
模組。在發光二極體晶片被製造成上述之產品之前，仍需要進行晶片之
封裝來完成與外部電訊之連接導通，目前發光二極體的封裝形式，依照
其後段封裝結構與製程的不同分為銀膠接合、打線接合及覆晶接合三種
形式，然而在成本及封裝廠商需求的考量之下，又以打線接合為最常使
用的方法。但在打線接合時，金球無法附著、墊片金屬層破壞及墊片下
方晶片的破壞等問題常常在打線的過程中發生，造成封裝良率的下降及
成本上面的損失。本研究提出單點探針試驗搭配具焦離子術顯微鏡系統
進行實際晶片破壞強度之檢測，並搭配有限元素分析，將實驗量測值帶
入模擬分析中以求得一絕對的極限破壞強度，此做極限破壞強度將作為
新型發光二極體研發設計時的一個設計參考，來減少研發時所花費之時
間。
