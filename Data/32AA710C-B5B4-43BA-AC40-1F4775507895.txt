Introduction 
The metal-backed bearing-surface in total knee prosthesis can be either fixed or 
mobile. In 1978, Goodfellow and O’Connor, in an attempt to mimic natural knee 
articulation, first introduced the concept of the mobile bearing (Oxford meniscal knee 
system) to knee arthroplasty.9 Buechel and Pappas designed the New Jersey 
Low-Contact Stress (LCS; DePuy, Warsaw, IN) total knee prosthesis, introducing the 
meniscus-bearing knee system in mid 1970s and also the rotating-platform bearing 
knee prosthesis shortly thereafter.3 Mobile bearing total knee arthroplasty was 
designed to diminish contact stress on the bearing surface and minimize the stresses at 
the interface of the implant composite to bone. It allows both congruity and mobility 
to improve wear resistance and minimize loosening. 
LCS rotating-platform bearing knee prosthesis was found to be performing well, 
with durable clinical and radiographic results.4 Several studies have discussed whether 
the bearing insert of rotating-platform design performed rotation after total knee 
arthroplasty as the designers intended. Emyr and co-worker found the mobile-bearing 
prosthesis could not cope with tibial tray rotation about its longitudinal axis by using 
cadavers and a pressure device.8 However, Dennis and co-worker showed 
polyethylene bearing mobility occurs following mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty 
and mobility is maintained during the time interval tested by fluoroscopic analyzed.7 
We also have reported the mobile-bearing knee can reduce maximum contact pressure 
more significantly than the fixed-bearing knee when tibiofemoral malalignment 
occurs.5,16 This result supposed the presence of polyethylene bearing mobility should 
result in lower contact stresses and reduce wearing of polyethylene. However, all 
above studies were indirect observation of polyethylene bearing insert of 
mobile-bearing knee prosthesis. 
Many investigations of wear pattern have been done to analyze the wear 
average time-interval from the primary operation to revision was 104 months (range 
from 48 to 180 months). All the tibial polyethylene bearing inserts were sterilized 
with gamma radiation in open air, and storage in vacuum package. The shelf life was 
no longer than two years. The diagnoses for primary surgery were osteoarthritis in all 
knees. All prostheses were fixed with cement. 
There were 12 Low Contact Stress rotating-platform prostheses (LCS, DePuy, 
Warsaw, Indiana) in mobile-bearing group. The LCS prosthesis was a posterior 
cruciate ligament sacrificed type and had a fully conforming (curve-on-curve) 
articular surface. In fixed-bearing group, there were 22 Porous-Coated Anatomic 
prostheses (PCA; Howmedica, Rutherford, New Jersey), and 39 Miller-Galante 
prostheses (MG, Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) were available for wear analysis. Both designs 
were posterior cruciate ligament retained type and had moderate conformity 
(flat-on-flat) articular surface. 
The wear patterns were analyzed by a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ6, Leica 
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and a digital image analysis system (Leica 
IM-1000, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A modified grading system for 
the severity of surface damage was used in this study.1,11,17 The tibial articulating 
surface was divided into medial and lateral sides and each side was further divided 
into three equal zones along the anteroposterior direction.1 The grading system 
consists of two parameters, one is “Damage amount present” and the other is 
“Severity factor”. Regarding to the “Damage amount present”, grade 0 to 3 was used 
to quantify the size of the worn area in each zone. Grade 0 meant that the damage was 
absent. Grades 1, 2 and 3 denoted the damage was less than 10%, 10% to 50%, and 
over 50% of the surface area respectively. Regarding to the “Severity factor”, seven 
grades correspond to the severity of wear modes. The grade 1 to 7 indicate burnishing, 
abrasion, cold flow, scratching, pitting and metal embedded, delamination, and wear 
was not found in LCS prostheses.  
Wearing of all kind of prostheses occurred most common in zone 2 and zone 5. 
PCA and MG prostheses showed a “straight-line scratch” pattern (Figure 2A) and 
LCS prostheses showed a “curve scratch” pattern (Figure 2B) in these two zones.  
Asymmetric wear: The incidence of asymmetric wear was shown in Table 4. 
Asymmetric wear were found in 3 of 12 (25.0%) LCS prostheses, 16 of 22 (72.7%) 
PCA prostheses, and 33 of 39 (84.6%) MG prostheses. The overall incidence of 
asymmetric wear was much higher in the fixed-bearing knee (49/61, 80.3%) than that 
in the mobile-bearing knee (3/12, 25%) (p=0.001). M/L asymmetric wear occurred in 
all types of prosthesis but was more common in the fixed-bearing knee (59.1% in 
PCA prostheses and 38.5% in MG prostheses) than that in the mobile-bearing the 
(25.0% in LCS prostheses). Asymmetric wear occurred more common in medial side 
(21 cases) than in lateral side (10 cases) of component. A/P asymmetric wear only 
occurred in the fixed-bearing knee (27.3% in PCA prostheses and 33.3% in MG 
prostheses) but not in the mobile-bearing knee. These asymmetric wear occurred more 
common in posterior portion (13 cases) than in anterior portion (6 cases) of 
component. I/E Rotational asymmetric wear occurred only in the fixed-bearing knee 
(22.7% in PCA prostheses and 25.6% in MG prostheses) and none in the 
mobile-bearing knee. 
 
Discussions 
Previous studies have been investigated the wear pattern of the polyethylene 
bearing insert.1,6,10,11,22,24,25 However these studies did not make any reference to the 
difference of wear pattern in mobile-bearing knee and fixed-bearing knee. Present 
results showed that the mobility of tibial tray in mobile-bearing design affects the 
wear pattern. 
the mobile-bearing knees may explain the reason for the generation of smaller and 
more granular wear debris in mobile bearing knees as we found in our previous 
study.12  
A high incidence of wear through (45.5%) is noted in PCA prostheses. Heat 
pressing of the polyethylene in PCA prostheses during manufacturing produced 
numerous defects in the material.6,20 This may contribute to this catastrophic damage. 
High prevalence of metal embedded in MG tibial inserts (10.3%) was found in 
this study. The wear of femoral component and severe wear of patella component 
were also noted during revision surgery. In our previous study, fixed-bearing group 
has a significant higher incidence of severe metal loss than that of mobile-bearing 
group.13 This resulted in metal-to-metal contact, which generated metal debris and 
third-body wear, and contributes to metal embedded on articulating surface of knee 
joint. These damages of metal component may also associate with the material of 
metal (titanium-alloy).2 
The scratching patterns in zone 2 and zone 5 show a “straight-line scratch” in 
PCA and MG prostheses while a “curve scratch” in LCS prostheses. These revealed 
that main direction of reciprocal motion between tibiofemoral joint was different in 
mobile-bearing and fixed-bearing knees. In fixed-bearing designs, the superior aspect 
of a polyethylene insert sustained multidirectional motions. These multidirectional 
motions resulted in anteroposterior and rotational scratch patterns on articular surface 
in fixed-bearing knees. In contrast with fixed-bearing knee, the rotating-platform knee 
is designed to have only rotational motion patterns (no AP translation). This design 
allows smooth rotation through the tibial tray/polyethylene-bearing articulation and 
effectively reduces polyethylene wear by decoupling multidirectional motions to two 
unidirectional motion patterns at differing interfaces (the superior and inferior 
surfaces). 
mobile-bearing prosthesis could not cope with tibial tray rotation about its 
longitudinal axis. However, the axial loading, which needs to drive the rotational 
motion of tibial insert in mobile-bearing knee, was not sufficient in their study. On the 
other hand, in vivo fluoroscopic studies have shown that bearing insert mobility 
occurs following mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty and mobility is maintained 
during the time interval tested.7  In present study, I/E rotational asymmetric wear was 
only found in fixed-bearing knee and did not occur in LCS rotating-platform mobile 
bearing knee. It verified the mobility of the polyethylene bearing insert allows 
spontaneous adjustment when malposition of the tibial baseplate occurred in vivo.  
In knee motion, the internal-external rotation of tibiofemoral joint will occur 
simultaneously when knee is flexed. In fixed-bearing design, the internal-external 
rotation occurred major on the articulating surface. However in mobile-bearing design, 
this internal-external rotation occurs on the interface between tibial insert and 
baseplate, it can reduce the rotational torque and further reduce the rotational wear. 
The present data showed the axial rotation occurs as designers of mobile-bearing 
knees intended, it occurs at the polyethylene bearing insert/tibial tray interface.  
 
Conclusions 
The mobile-bearing knee had lower wear score than the fixed-bearing knee. Low 
grade damage modes were more frequently seen in the mobile-bearing knee, while 
high grade damage modes were more frequently seen in the fixed-bearing knee. The 
mobile-bearing knee also had a lower incidence of asymmetric wear. No I/E 
asymmetric wear observed in the rotating-platform mobile-bearing knees. The results 
of this study prove the spontaneous adjustment of tibiofemoral malrotation in 
mobile-bearing knee dose occurred in vivo. These results also support the advantages 
of lower contact stresses, unidirectional wear, and reducing the potential for
