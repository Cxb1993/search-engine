ABSTRACT 
This work describes a novel modeling scheme to elucidate the frequencies of carbon 
nanotubes via continuum mechanics by considering the van der Waals force interaction based 
on differential quadrature simulations, in which nanobeam-bending paradigms are utilized. 
The proposed modeling scheme is highly promising for advanced carbon nanotube 
applications. This work investigates multi-walled carbon nanotube frequencies via continuum 
mechanics based spline collocation simulations using nanobeam-bending models. This 
modeling approach is suitable for the development of multi-walled carbon nanotube 
applications. The spline collocation procedure converts partial differential equations of 
vibration problems of multi-walled carbon nanotubes into a discrete eigenvalue problem. The 
effects of surrounding elastic medium stiffness and van der Waals forces on the dynamic 
 4
important material feature. The stiffness of carbon nanotubes is a hundred times higher than 
that of steel [6,7]. Additionally, the nanomechanical behavior of carbon nanotubes was 
elucidated using finite element analysis [8]. Ke et al. [9,10] investigated single- and double- 
clamped nanotubes under electrostatic actuation. Keblinski et al. [11,12,13] noted an 
essentially classical distribution of charge density with a significantly charged concentration 
at the tube end of conductive nanotubes. Poncharal et al. [14] determined that static and 
dynamic mechanical deflections were electrically induced in cantilevered, multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes in a transmission electron microscope. The nanotubes were resonantly 
excited at the fundamental frequency and high harmonics, as determined by their deflected 
contours, which closely correspond to those determined for cantilevered elastic beams [14]. 
By adopting the differential quadrature scheme, this work attempts to generate the problems 
of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in a matrix form. The integrity and computational accuracy 
of the differential quadrature approach for solving the carbon nanotube problem are evaluated 
through numerous case studies. Vibration analysis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes has 
seldom been performed using the differential quadrature method. Figure 1 schematically 
depicts an embedded carbon nanotube. The van der Waals pressure should be a linear function 
of the difference of the deflections of the two adjacent layers at the point [15-18]. The van der 
Waals forces include all intermolecular forces. The van der Waals forces act between 
electrically neutral molecules. Numerous complex nanobeam problems have been solved 
 6
For a beam problem, the most feasible approach is to select equally spaced sample points. 
However, an extremely poor accuracy is typical when using such a sample point distribution.  
Accurate and stable results have been achieved using this sample method. Validity of the 
proposed modeling scheme is demonstrated by considering several examples of the vibrations 
of the carbon nanotubes. Figures 2 and 3 present the frequencies of the fixed-free carbon 
nanotubes obtained using the differential quadrature method. The material and the geometric 
parameters of the carbon nanotube are 1 1.4outD nanometer= , 1 0.7nnD nanometer= , 
140L nanometer= , 3 32.3 10 /kg mρ = ×  and E 1 TPa=  [16]. Various numbers of 
sample points for each nanotube, i.e. 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, are selected for accuracy in 
analysis. The numerical results calculated using the differential quadrature method with the 
Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto distribution and thirteen sample points correlate well with the 
exact solutions. The numerical results obtained using the differential quadrature method with 
the uniform distribution and fifteen sample points closely correspond to the exact solutions. A 
more accurate discrete model of the carbon nanotube can be derived by the differential 
quadrature method with the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto sample grid points than the uniform 
sample grid points. Accuracy of the numerical results depends on both the number of sample 
points and the sample point distribution. Figure 4 displays the frequencies of the clamped-free 
carbon nanotubes for various length-to-radius ratios,

clamped-free carbon nanotubes generally increase rapidly with a decreasing length of the

compared with the literature results [16]. Numerical results obtained using the differential 
quadrature method with the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto distribution and seventeen sample 
points closely correspond to results in literature [16]. Numerical results obtained using the 
differential quadrature method with the uniform distribution and nineteen sample points 
closely correspond to results in literature [16]. The accuracy of the differential quadrature 
method depends on the selection of the locations of the sample points. The 
Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto distribution typically yields better results than the uniform 
distribution. Figure 12 describes the frequencies of the simply supported carbon nanotubes for 
various length-to-radius ratios,

supported ends decrease with an increasing length of the nanotubes. Figure 13 illustrates the 
frequencies of the carbon nanotubes for various surrounding medium stiffnesses. The 
frequencies of the simply supported carbon nanotubes increase with an increase of 
surrounding elastic medium stiffnesses. Figures 14, 15, 16, and 17 display the frequencies of 
the five-walled carbon nanotubes with clamped-free ends. The material and the geometric

DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF MULTI-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES USING THE 
SPLINE COLLOCATION METHOD 
 
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes have good nanomechanical and electrical characteristics.  
ive elastic moduli of carbon nanotubes for nanocomposite structures. The spline collocation 
method is employed to formulate vibrational problems of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in a 
matrix form. The integrity and computational accuracy of the spline collocation method in 
solving this problem is evaluated through a range of case studies. This is the first time the 
spline collocation method is successfully applied to the dynamic problem of multi-walled 
carbon nanotubes. Solutions to numerous complex nanobeam problems have been efficiently 
obtained using fast computers and various numerical methods, including the Galerkin method, 
finite element technique, boundary element method, and Rayleigh-Ritz method. In this work, 
the spline collocation method is employed to formulate discrete eigenvalue problems of 
various multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Prenter et al. [33-36] investigated spline and variation 
methods. Bert and Sheu [36] presented static analysis results for beams and plates using the 
spline collocation method. El-Hawary et al. [37] discussed quartic spline collocation methods 
to solve linear elliptical partial differential equations, and derived optimal quartic spline 
 22
the surrounding elastic medium stiffness increases the frequencies of carbon nanotubes. 
Figure 28 shows the frequencies of the simply supported carbon nanotubes for various 
degrees of surrounding elastic medium stiffness. The frequencies of simply supported carbon 
nanotubes increase as the surrounding elastic medium stiffness increases. Numerical results 
obtained using the spline collocation method are very close to the numerical results derived 
using the finite element method. Figure 29 shows the frequencies of clamped-free carbon 
nanotubes with various degrees of surrounding elastic medium stiffness. The frequencies of 
clamped-free carbon nanotubes typically increase rapidly as elastic medium stiffness 
increases. The numerical results obtained using the spline collocation method closely follows 
the numerical results obtained using the finite element method. The simply supported 
boundary conditions give rise to higher frequencies of carbon nanotubes compared with those 
for clamped-free boundary conditions. The clamped-clamped boundary conditions generate 
higher frequencies of the carbon nanotubes than those generated by simply supported 
boundary conditions. Figure 30 plots the frequencies of fixed-free multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes. The material and geometric parameters of the multi-walled carbon nanotube are 
1 2.08outD nanometer= , 1 0.68innD nanometer= , 2 3.48outD nanometer= ,

The ease in using the spline collocation method has been clearly demonstrated. Space 
derivatives are discretized successfully using the spline collocation approach. This study 
demonstrates the accuracy of the spline collocation method for vibration analysis of 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The demonstrated accuracy and simplicity of the spline 
collocation approach make it a good candidate for modeling relatively more complex 
problems in other scientific fields.
