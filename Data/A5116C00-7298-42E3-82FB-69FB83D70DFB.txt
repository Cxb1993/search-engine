1. Abstract
Electrical, optical properties, and
microstructures of ZnNb2O6 thin films prepared
by the sol-gel method on ITO/glass substrates
at different annealing temperatures have been
investigated. The selected-area diffraction
pattern showed that the deposited films
exhibited a polycrystalline microstructure.
All films exhibited ZnNb2O6 (031), (131),
(060), and (162) orientation perpendicular to
the substrate surface and the grain size with the
increase in the annealing temperature. At an
annealing temperature of 700C, the ZnNb2O6
films with 55 nm thickness possess a dielectric
constant of 24 at 1 kHz, a dissipation factor of
0.16 at 1 kHz, a leakage current density of
7.04×10-6 A/cm2 at an electrical field of 30
kV/cm and an optical bandgap of 3.9 eV.
Considering the primary memory switching
behavior of ZnNb2O6, ReRAM based on
ZnNb2O6 shows promise for future nonvolatile
memory applications.

2. Introduction
Dielectric materials have been developed
to meet the requirements of various
applications in recent years because they can be
utilized for filters, stabilize the frequency of
oscillation in microwave integrated circuits,
and increase the storage capacitance density in
dynamic random access memory (DRAM). In
addition, high permittivity dielectric films with
low leakage current are of great importance for
a variety of integrated devices, such as
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors. For
the next generation of ULSI DRAM, it is
widely believed that dielectric materials with
high dielectric constant, such as SrTiO3, Ta2O5,
and (Ba,Sr)TiO3, are needed for storage
capacitors.1,2 The use of such thin films that are
fabricated with high dielectric constant
materials makes it possible to reduce the size of
storage capacitors and to simplify the memory
cell structure for higher integration density. On
the other hand, these prepared thin films are
also capable of reducing the dimension of
device in communication integrated circuit
system.
The columbite structure, MNb2O6 (where
M = Ca+2, Co+2, Ni+2, Zn+2, Mg+2 and Mn+2)
series, have attracted much attention for their
high Q-values and low dielectric constant in
comparison with the complex perovskites.3-5
ZnNb2O6 has been widely used in microwave
ceramic capacitors and resonators because of its
high dielectric constant, high Q-values, and
thermal stability.6-8 The ZnNb2O6 exhibits the
microwave dielectric properties with a good
quality factor Q×f value of 83,700 GHz, a
dielectric constant of 25, and a temperature
coefficient of resonant frequency of -56 ppm/oC.
Many experiments were performed to study the
preparation and properties of ZnNb2O6,
however, most studies on ZnNb2O6 have been
limited to the bulk ceramic form.9,10
On the other hand, thin-film capacitors
fabricated using an electrode pattern are often
used in the fabrication of high-frequency
circuits. The characteristics of thin-film
capacitor elements include capacitance per unit
area, temperature coefficient of capacitance,
leakage current, dissipation factor, and
breakdown voltage. As previously mentioned,
ZnNb2O6 has excellent characteristics such as
high dielectric constant, which is much higher
than SiO2, low dielectric loss, and
high-temperature stability. On the other hand,
out of a number of available thin-film
deposition techniques, the sol–gel technique
offers a number of unique features, such as
purity, better homogeneity, excellent control
over the stoichiometry of thin films, lower
processing temperature, easier introduction of
dopant for tailoring the properties, substrates
with non-planer shapes, large area deposition,
and more importantly, the process can be easily
made on-line with the existing semiconductor
with increasing annealing temperature. It may
due be to organics reduction and film
crystallization occurring at higher annealing
temperature.

thin films with various annealing temperatures.

ZnNb2O6 thin films deposited at various

The influences of the annealing
temperature on the surface morphologies of the
film were studied by atomic force microscopy
(Fig. 4). From Figure 4, we observe that each
deposited film had close–packed columns and
the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the
films decreased as the annealing temperature
was increased. The corresponding RMS
roughness of ZnNb2O6 films obtained from
AFM images reveals that the surface roughness
decreased from 9.7 nm to 7.5 nm as the
annealing temperature increased from 500oC to
700oC, while the grain sizes were almost
invariant and the surfaces of the ZnNb2O6 films
were more uniform. This may be due to the
higher kinetic energies which improve the
microstructure.13,14 Therefore, suitable
annealing temperature causes a surface energy,
which improves the surface morphology of the
growing film.

thin films at different annealing temperatures (a)

Figure 5 shows the transmittance spectra of
ZnNb2O6 thin films deposited on ITO/glass
substrate with various annealing temperatures.
The transmittance values for the ZnNb2O6 films
have already been taken out of the transmittance
value of the ITO/glass substrate. The average
optical transmission percentage was calculated
for wavelengths ranging from 400 to 800 nm.
The transmission in the visible region depends
on the wavelength. Surface morphology also
has a strong influence on the optical properties
of the films. The transmittance exhibits wave
trough at the wavelength ~480 nm due to the
interference effect of light between two
interfaces the air–film and film–substrate. The
increase in transmittance by applying the
annealing treatment may be due to a decrease in
optical scattering caused by the densification of
grains followed by grain growth and the
reduction of grain boundary density. The
average transmission in the visible range is over
70% and the sharp absorption edges are
observed in the ultraviolet region at an
annealing temperature of 700oC.
In addition, the optical absorption
coefficient is defined as α = (1/t)ln[T/(1 –R)2],
where t is the thickness of the film, T is the
transmittance, and R is the reflectance. The
optical bandgap, Eg, was determined from the
absorption spectra using the equation: αhν=
A(hν–Eg)m/2, where m = 1 for direct transition,
m = 4 for indirect transition, h is the Planck
surface morphology. The morphological
structure is more dense and uniform with
increasing annealing temperature. In addition,
decreased crystal defect and increased grain
size were also produced with increased
annealing temperature.17,18 Because the
deposited atom would obtain more kinetic
energy with higher annealing temperature,
ZnNb2O6 films with uniform grains and lower
surface roughness could be fabricated, which
resulted in a reduction of the leakage current. A
leakage current density of 7.04×10-6 A/cm2 was
obtained near an electrical field of 30 kV/cm
with an annealing temperature of 700 °C, a
value that is close to the leakage current density
of SiO2.

Pt/ZnNb2O6/ITO/glass MIM structure at
different annealing temperatures.
Fig. 10 Dissipation factor of ZnNb2O6 thin
films at different annealing temperatures.
Figure 9 shows type J –E1/2 curves of the
ZnNb2O6 films deposited on an ITO/glass
substrate at different annealing temperatures
with positive bias (from 0 to 5 V) to the top
electrode. When leakage currents of ZnNb2O6
films are plotted as a function of electric field, it
is observed that they follow either Schottky
emission or Frenkel–Poole emission. Schottky
emission occurs at the interface between the
films and the electrode where a Schottky barrier
is formed. It is shown that the leakage currents
are almost proportional to the electrical field.
This effect was attributed to the absorption
current due to the dielectric relaxation
phenomena of the ZnNb2O6 capacitors. Besides,
the current density depends on the polarity of
the applied voltage. However, the plot ln(J)
versus E1/2 shows a linear relationship with a
dependent electric field. This result indicates
that the I–V characteristics of ZnNb2O6
capacitors can be explained by Schottky
emission in the external electric field region.19,20
The dissipation factor is due to the leakage
current through the loss by a parallel resistance.
Therefore, the loss tangent increases as the
resistance decreases and leakage current
increases. Figure 10 shows the dissipation factor
of ZnNb2O6 thin films with various annealing
temperatures. As the annealing temperature
increases, the dissipation factors decrease due to
uniform thin-film morphology. With an
annealing temperature of 700oC, a dissipation
factor of 0.16 was measured at 1 kHz.
Figure 11 shows a pronounced hysteretic
I–V characteristic with two different conduction
states. Depicted at voltage sweep 0negative
biaspositive bias0, the resistance switch for
ZnNb2O6 is obtained in a clockwise way, i.e.,
the current increases and enters into its high
current (on) state at negative switching voltage
and into low current (off) state at a positive one.
We observed two distinct conduction states of
ZnNb2O6 devices, as shown in Fig. 11. Gate
bias was directly applied to Pt-gate with the
substrate at ground. The high-resistance state
was switched to a low-resistance state by
voltage stress with current compliance with
various preheating temperatures at different
annealing temperatures. The distinct difference
between high-resistance and low-resistance has
been observed with the higher preheating
temperature and annealing temperature was
developed in the ZnNb2O6 thin films. The on/off
