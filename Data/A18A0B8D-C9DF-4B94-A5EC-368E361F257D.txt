2. Abstract 
2, 2-Dimethoxy-Propane (DMP) was studied 
as an additive in 1 mol dm-3 LiPF6 ethylene 
carbonate and diethyl carbonate (1:1 by weight) 
for lithium ion battery, which was characterized 
by cyclic voltammetry and half cell tests. Cyclic 
voltammetry and half cell data show that the use 
of DMP as an additive to the organic solutions at 
very low level (ca. 0.005 wt%) offers the 
advantage of forming fully developed passive 
films on the graphite anode surface. The 
electrochemical performance of the 
additive-containing electrolytes in combination 
with LiCoO2 cathode and graphitic anode was 
also tested in commercial cells 103448. The 
results reveal that the cyclic life test and storage 
performance at high temperature (ca. 60 oC) in 
electrolyte with DMP additive was better than 
that in an electrolyte without additive. Therefore, 
DMP can be considered as a desirable additive in 
electrolyte for lithium ion batteries operating at 
high temperature, ca. 60 oC..

3. INTRODUCTION 
In commercially available lithium - ion 
batteries, lithium ion is electrochemically 
intercalated into the graphite negative electrode 
during charging, and de-intercalated during 
discharging [1, 2]. These reactions are basically 
reversible, and however, the reversibility depends 
greatly on the kind of electrolyte solution. Alkyl 
carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC), 
diethyl carbonate (DEC), and dimethyl carbonate 
(DMC), are among the most important solvents 
for electrolyte of lithium ion batteries because 
they are aprotic, polar, and non-volatile. It has 
been found [3-6] that the carbon material has 
good cyclic life and maintains a high potential in 
EC/DEC electrolyte due to the formation of a 
good passive film on the carbon surface. Zaghib 
et al. [5] found that the formation of the passive 
film was not only due to solvent decomposition 
but was also affected by nature of salt in the 
EC/DEC system. EC/DEC mixed solvent systems 
are currently used in commercially available 
lithium - ion cells employing graphite as a 
negative electrode.

surface. In this half cell investigation, there is no 
difference between graphite electrodes, and 
therefore, the performance of discharge capacity 
involves the different SEI film caused by DMP 
addition. Based on this opinion, it can be 
assumed that DMP electrolyte additive involves 
the formation of SEI film. According to the 
above data, it indicates that 0.005 wt% DMP 
addition in this work exhibits constructive 
efficiency of half cell discharge for Li-ion 
battery. 
5.2 Electrochemical test 
According to the above half cell results, it is 
assumed that DMP electrolyte additive involves 
the formation of SEI film. In order to confirm 
this assumption, cyclic voltammetry is employed 
for this purpose. Fig. 1 shows the cyclic 
voltammograms of graphite electrode in 1 mol 
dm-3 LiPF6-EC/DEC (1:1 by w/w) with different 
DMP addition. For all plots in Fig. 1, there is an 
obvious oxidation peak, which is interpreted as 
the deintercalation of lithium from the graphite 
layer into the electrolyte, at about 0.5 V. The 
relative maximum reduction current, which is 
contributed by the intercalation of Li+ into the 
graphite layer, is at 0 V. Besides, it can be 
observed another reduction peak at 0.5 V. It is 
caused by the formation of SEI film. Note that 
the plot with no DMP addition has the highest 
reduction peak current of SEI film formation. 
The reduction peak current is decreased with 
DMP addition, which indicates the decrease of 
graphite-electrolyte reaction for SEI film 
formation. 
The less graphite involves the SEI film 
formation, the more active site of graphite layer 
can be used for lithium storage. However, an 
examination of Fig. 1, it can be found that the 
oxidation peak current becomes lower after DMP 
addition. It can be interpreted that the SEI film 
becomes more thin and dense, and therefore, it is 
difficult for the transfer of lithium.  
5.3 Full cell investigation 
Subsequently, the full cell test is employed 
in order to confirm the better performance after 
DMP electrolyte additive addition. The cell 
formation is an important step for SEI film 
formation, and Table 2 shows the formation data 
in this study. The interior resistance (ACR) after 
cell formation becomes lower than that (ACR1) 
before formation because of the SEI film 
formation. The similar thickness of the both cell 
indicates that there is no extortionate gas formed 
due to the addition of DMP. Interestingly, the 
discharge capacity becomes higher after the 
addition of DMP. It indicates that less graphite 
loss on the formation of SEI film and more Li+ 
can be stored in the graphite layer. 
Fig. 2 shows the results of cycling number 
test at different temperature for comparison the 
contribution of DMP additive. Note that, with the 
increasing cycling numbers at 23oC, the 
discharge capacity of the cell with DMP becomes 
worse than that without DMP addition. However, 
at 45oC, there is no distinct difference in the 
performance of cycling number whether DMP is 
added or not. Surprisingly, the cell with DMP 
addition exhibits better discharge capacity after 
60 cycling test at 60oC. This differential behavior 
is caused by the SEI film modified with DMP 
electrolyte additive. 
Since the cell shows better performance 
with DMP electrolyte additive addition at high 
temperature, the cells with/without DMP addition 
are stored at 60oC for one week for comparison. 
The results of high temperature storage are 
shown in Table 3. The discharge capacity of the 
first cycle (0.2 C) shows no difference whether 
DMP is added or not. However, the cell with 
DMP addition maintains higher discharge 
capacity (0.2 C Ret.) than that without DMP 
addition after one week storage at high 
temperature. One reason of the above 
phenomenon represents the destruction of SEI 
film at high temperature. The other is the increase 
graphite-electrolyte interface reaction. In order to 
confirm the contribution of DMP electrolyte 
additive, the cells after high temperature storage 
are re-charged/discharged. As we can see in Table 
3, the cell with DMP addition still shows higher 
discharge capacity (0.2 C Rec.). Based on this 
evidence, it can indicate that the SEI film with 
DMP modification is stable and protect graphite 
from the reaction with electrolyte at high 
temperature. The cell is subsequently studied the 
cycling number test at 60oC. After 100 cycling 
number test, the cell with DMP addition still 
shows better performance for discharge capacity 
(C100) than that without DMP.
