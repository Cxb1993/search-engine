Key words: endoscope, wireless capsule endoscope, embedded image sensing system, CMOS
image sensor, CMOS imager
The goal of this research project is to develop an embedded image sensing system utilized for a
wireless capsule endoscope (WCE). The wireless capsule endoscope is a non-intrusive way for
medical doctors to examine the patients’digestion system and does much less harm to the patient’s
body compared with traditional endoscopes.
The WCE project is partitioned into the following five sub-systems: a three-dimensional
wireless position control system, an embedded image sensing system, an analog-to-digital
converter, a signal compression and processing system, and a wireless communication, wireless
power transfer system. The embedded image sensing system consists of an integrated light emitter,
a miniature optical lens, an image sensor array and associated readout circuitry. The image sensing
system is the most front-end analog interface of the whole system. It converts the image signals
from optical domain into electrical domain for the following electronic sub-systems to process.
Since the sensor will be used on a wireless capsule endoscope, systematic issues such as power
consumption, chip area, sensor array resolution, and system integration capability are critical
factors to be considered. Among the major two solid-state image sensor technologies–CCD
(Charge Couple Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technologies,
CMOS image sensor technology turns out to be the better choice with the above considerations.
CMOS image sensor technology was developed based upon logic or mixed-mode CMOS
technologies. Several image sensor processing modules are inserted in the fabrication process to
optimize optical sensing performance. Therefore, it is suitable for building an on-chip imaging
system. From power consumption perspective, CMOS imagers typically consume one tenth of
power compared with CCD imagers. That’s because CCD imagers require high frequency, high
1Achievements:
This project contains design, manufacturing, and testing of CMOS image sensor
chips for wireless capsule endoscope application. The achievements of this research
include the following items:
 Design an embedded CMOS imager chip for wireless capsule endoscope
application. The imager design is ready to be used for an imaging
system-on-chip.
 Design an efficient sensor array readout circuit for analog-to-digital
conversion as the following stage.
Results:
Figure 1 shows the circuit blocks for the imager chip. It contains a 640x480
sensor array, readout circuitey, bias circuits, row/column recoders and on-chip
analog memories for signal buffering.
Figure 2 shows the die photo of the final imager chip.
Table I demonstrates the characterization results of the embedded CMOS imager
chip. Important parameters are the followinjg. The resolution of the sensor array is
640x480. Readout speed can reach at least 30 frames per second. The pixel size is
3.3μmx3.3μm. Dynamic range of the imager chip can reach 67dB, equivalent to 
10bit resolution roughly.
Figure 4 shows the setup of the characterization system. Key equipment include
an uniform illumination light source and its controller, an optical meter for
measuring the illumination levels, a PC with an image frame grabber to display the
captured image, a second PC with a GPIB interface for integrating all instruments,
and a light shield box for illumination level control.
