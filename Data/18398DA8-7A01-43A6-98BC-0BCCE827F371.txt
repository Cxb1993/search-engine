一、 計劃中文摘要(關鍵詞：逆散射，完全
金屬物體、動態差異形演化法) 
本報告研究一數值方法，主要研究頻域穿
牆之電磁成像問題，利用動態差異形演化法則
來重建埋藏於牆之後的完全金屬導體形狀與位
置。假定一個未知形狀的完全金屬導體埋藏在
牆壁之後，從外部入射電磁波照射掩埋在牆壁
之後的未知物體，並在牆壁外部接收量測其散
射場，再利用動態差異形演化法，將電磁成像
問題轉化為求解最佳化問題。藉由將量測而得
的散射場和動態差異形演化法所計算出的散射
場數值相比較，若兩個散射場之差值越來越小
時，則表示重建出來的未知物體越良好。 
 動態差異形演化法為一全域搜尋之最佳化
方法，動態差異形演化法是以族群差異度進行
演化，由於初期時族群差異度較大，使得早期
探索全域能力較強，而隨著演化的演進，差異
度變小，使得後期在開發能力增加。此法的優
點可突破傳統最佳化法的解答只能收斂於局部
極小值，即使最初的猜測值與實際值相距甚
遠，但仍可以求出準確的數值解，成功的重建

英文摘要(Keywords：Through-Wall Imaging 
(TWI), Shape Reconstruction, Dynamic 
Differential Evolution (DDE). 
    A model for two-dimensional layered 
medium is proposed for the through-wall imaging 
problem. The ability of dynamic differential 
evolution (DDE) stochastic searching algorithm 
for shape reconstruction of 2-D conducting targets 
hidden behind a homogeneous building wall is 
demonstrated by using simulated backscattered 
fields. After an integral formulation, a 
discretization using the method of moment (MoM) 
is applied. The through-wall imaging (TWI) 
problem is recast as a nonlinear optimization 
problem with an objective function defined by the 
norm of a difference between the measured and 
calculated scattered electric field. Thus, the shape 
of metallic cylinder can be obtained by minimizing 
the objective function. Simulations show that DDE 
can successfully reconstruct the through-wall 
imaging for metallic cylinders. In addition, the 
effect of Gaussian noise on the reconstruction is 
investigated.  
二、計劃緣由與目的 
微波成像(microwave imaging)是一種藉由儀
器量測所得之微波能量訊號並將此能量訊號經
由適當處理轉換成影像的形式來呈現的一種技
術。此技術經常被應用於非破壞性檢測、遙測
礦產資源、醫學影像等問題。由於微波能量具
有穿透力，因此微波能量照射在介質物體上會
產生反射、散射與透射波。並且此散射波會因
為入射波的極化、頻率提供不同的微波能量訊
息。因此近年來微波成像技術受到學者們的重
視也使得微波成像(microwave imaging) 於逆
散射之領域一直不斷地發展。然而微波成像技
術 亦 有 其 天 生 之 缺 憾 : 非 唯 一 解 問 題
(non-uniqueness) 、 不 良 情 況 問 題 (ill- 
posedness)、非線性問題(nonlinearity)。

2. THEORETICAL FORMULATION
Let’s consider a conducting cylinder buried in a lossy homogeneous half-space, as shown in Fig. 1.
The media in regions 1 and 2 are characterized by the permittivity and conductivity (ε1, σ1) and
(ε2, σ2), respectively, while the permeability µ0 is used for each region, i.e., only non-magnetic
media are concerned here. The cross section of the cylinder is described by polar coordinates in
the xy plane through the shape function ρ = F (θ). The cylinder is illuminated by a plane wave
with time dependence exp(jωt), of which the electric field is assumed parallel to the z-axis (i.e.,
transverse magnetic or TM polarization). Let Einc denote the incident E field from region 1 to
region 2 with incident angle φ1. By using the induced current concept, the scattered field can be
expressed as the integral of the two-dimensional Green’s function multiplies by the induced surface
current density, which is proportional to the normal derivative of the electric field on the conductor
surface [3, 12]. As a result, for the direct problem, given the shape of the object, we can use the
boundary condition to solve the surface current density, then calculate the scattered field by using
the two dimensional half-space Green’s function. For numerical calculation of the direct problem,
the contour of the object is first divided into sufficient small segments so that the induced surface
current density can be consider constant over each segment. Then the moment method is used to
solve the equations with a pulse basis function for expanding and Dirac delta function for testing.
Let us consider the following inverse problem: given the scattered field, determine the shape
F (θ). Here the shape F (θ) is assumed to be star-like. In other words, F (θ) can be expanded as:
F (θ) =
N/2∑
n=0
Bn cos(nθ) +
N/2∑
n=1
Cn sin(nθ) (1)
where Bn and Cn are real coefficient to be determined, and N is the number of unknowns for shape
function of the object. In the inversion procedure, the SSGA is used to minimize the root mean
square error of the measured scattered field and the calculated scattered field, through three genetic
operators: reproduction, crossover and mutation. When the root mean square error changes by less
than 1% in two successive generations, the SSGA is terminated and a solution is then obtained.
Note that the regularization term can be added to avoid ill-conditioned problems. Please refer the
reference [11] for detail.
3. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Let us consider a conducting cylinder buried in a lossless half-space as Fig. 1. The permittivity in
region 1 and region 2 is characterized by ε0 and 2.56ε0 respectively. A TM polarization plane wave
of unit amplitude is incident from region 1. The frequency of the incident wave is chosen to be
1GHz, 2GHz, 3GHz, 4GHz and 5GHz. The object is buried at a depth 0.1m and the scattered
field is measured on a probing line along the interface between region 1 and region 2. Our purpose
is to reconstruct the shape of the object by using the scattered field at different incident angles. To
reconstruct the shape of the object, the object is illuminated by incident waves from three different
directions and 20 measurement points at equal spacing are used along the interface for each incident
angle. There are 60 measurement points in each simulation. The measurement is taken from x = 0
to 0.2m for incident angle −pi/3, from x = −0.1 to 0.1m for incident angle 0, and from x = −0.2 to
0m for incident angle pi/3. To save computing time, the number of unknowns is set to be 9. The
population size is chosen as 100. The binary string length of the unknown coefficient, Bn and Cn, is
set to be 16 bits. The binary string length of conductivity is also set to be 16 bits. In other words,
the bit number of a chromosome is 144. The search range for the unknown coefficient of the shape
function is chosen to be from 0 to 0.1. The extreme value of the coefficient of the shape function
can be determined by the prior knowledge of the objects. The crossover probability and mutation
probability are set to be 0.8 and 0.1 respectively. In our example, the shape function is chosen to
be F (θ) = (0.027+0.01 sin 3θ)m. The reconstructed relative root mean square errors for the shape
versus different frequencies are plotted in Fig. 2. It is found that the reconstruction for 1GHz and
5GHz are poor, which the reconstruction for 2GHz, 3GHz and 4GHz are fair. Roughly speaking,
the reconstruction for 3GHz is fairly satisfactory. Physically this can be explained by the fact that
the information available from the shadow region decreases if the wave number increases. On the
other hand, the scattering pattern becomes isotropic at very low frequencies and thus insensitive
to the variation of shape resulting in large errors.

Abstract— A new modulation scheme for short range signal transmission is considered. The
signal is modulated by sinusoidal waveforms and it is based on the majority of positive or negative
waveforms in a symbol interval to determine which symbol, 1 or 0, is transmitted. The system
performance implemented with this new modulation scheme is simulated and compares with the
traditional BPSK modulation, it has the result that when the system is not synchronized and
the transmitted signal suffers a delay greater than a threshold then the new design modulation
scheme has a better performance than the traditional BPSK modulation and its allowable delay
range is also larger than the BPSK format. With this modulation method we can simplify the
receiver terminal hardware structure and to reduce the total system cost.
1. INTRODUCTION
As time evolves, many new wireless communications [1–3] have been developed and some wireline
communications have been replaced by their equivalent wireless communications. Wireless commu-
nications have been applied in our surrounding environments either in the long range transmission
or in the short distance communications; however in the wireless transmission it has serious inter-
ference problems [4] than that in the wireline transmissions. In this paper it is mainly considers
the synchronization problem. In the communication system the goodness of synchronization at the
receiving terminal determines the correctness of the demodulated signal and in order to generate
correct demodulated signal it needs to know the correct starting position of the received symbols
otherwise the system performance will be deteriorated. In this paper for short range transmission
we develop a new modulation scheme and compare its performance, such as Bit Error Rate (BER),
versus signal transmission delay time with the traditional applied BPSK modulation [5–8]. This
paper is organized as follows. A new modulation format and its associated demodulation mecha-
nism are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3 the system performance with the new modulation
scheme is performed through MATLAB simulation. Finally a conclusion is drawn in Section 4.
2. CONSTRUCTION OF SIGNALS
As shown in Fig. 1 is the definition of the transmitted signals. For the symbol 0 it is the combination
of one positive sinusoidal wave and two negative sinusoidal waves while for the symbol 1 it is
the combination of two positive sinusoidal waves and one negative sinusoidal wave as shown in
Equations (1) and (2) respectively with period of 3pi.

the result with 10 sample points is shown with solid line with circle while for 128 sample points it
is represented by the solid line.
3.2. Simulation Results Without Delay
The system performance, BER vs. SNR, is compared between our proposed new modulation
method and the traditional BPSK modulation with a period of 2pi. The system performance
is simulated in the channel with additive white Gaussian noise when the transmitted signal is
maintained at the same power level [10, 11]. The simulation result is shown in Fig. 5 where the
solid line with hollow circle represents the result from the implementation of Method I modulation,
solid line with solid circle is the result from using Method II modulation and the solid line is
the result from BPSK modulation. It also reveals from the figure that at the same SNR the
BPSK has the lowest BER performance and under no delay assumption it has 2 dB degradation
in Method I modulation comparing with the BPSK modulation while it is 13 dB worse in the
Method II modulation. Since the new modulation we proposed is for short range transmission we
will then consider when the SNR is fixed the delay effect on the system performance when the noise
effect is ignored.
3.3. The Allowable Delay Range When the SNR Is Fixed
In this subsection we consider when SNR is fixed at certain level the relation between delay and
system BER, it has simulation results as shown in Fig. 6 where we maintain the SNR at 16 dB and
find how long the delay will be when the BER is so large that we could not successfully demodulate
the transmitted signal. In the simulation the period for BPSK is selected as 2pi while it is 3pi
for the new modulation method and its result is shown in Fig. 6. In the figure the dotted line
represents the Method I modulation while Method II results is represented by the line with solid

Abstract— LTE-A technique will play an important role in the next generation wireless com-
munications due to it has the advantages of high transmission rate and wide communication
bandwidth especially it also provides high quality throughput when the user is moving in high
velocity. The system performance and parameters characteristics resulting from utilizing LTE-A
technique will be provided to the system designers valuable references in their development of
future IMT-Advanced wireless communication systems. When the system bandwidth becomes
wider the system utilization performance will be varied widely and may become inefficiency when
the number of users served in the system coverage areas varies and the communication environ-
ments change. It could adopt the coordination technique among base stations to effectively utilize
the system resources and to reduce the possible interferences among signals in their transmissions.
In this paper it considers of how to utilize repeaters in the base station coverage areas to optimize
the spectral efficiency of the base station in its backbone transmission. It utilizes repeaters to
improve the indoor signal transmission quality when the users in the indoor environment could
not receive the signal transmitted from the outdoor base stations.
1. INTRODUCTION
As the emergence of new wireless communication technologies the demand for network applications
becomes diversified and the request for service quality is also correspondingly increased; the network
has become an indispensible apparatus in human life. It then incurs the issue of how to properly
utilize and apply the network resource anytime and anywhere. Early generations of wireless mobile
communication system are unable to meet the current users requirements that the network service
providers need to expand their system bandwidth through new wireless technology development
and meanwhile to expand their wireless networks coverage range. The new interface standard
proposed by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and IEEE 802.16m all contains the
advantages of high transmission data rate, broad bandwidth and wide coverage area; and it comes
to the problem of how to select or set the optimum system parameters for the new development
systems in practical operations. As shown in Figure 1, a user is located in the coverage area of many
base stations. After the user is inter-connected by many base stations through the implementation
of the coordination operation among base stations, the user’s receiving gain can be increased and
also its interference can be reduced by implementing the techniques such as Coordinated Multi-
input Multi-output (Co-MIMO) and Coordinated Multiplexing (CoMP) [1–3]. In this paper it
will analyze the probable bandwidth occupied by the base station when users are interconnected
by many base stations and then to determine the proper situation to implement the coordination
scheme among base stations to improve the system performance. When base station 1 (BS1) and
base station 2 (BS2) use different carrier frequencies, the user equipment (UE) or the user can base
on the magnitudes of each base station’s signal to noise ratio to determine which link has better
receiving signal quality; on the other hand when both stations use the same carrier frequency the
UE will have enhancement in its received signal strength by using proper combining technique.
2. CHANNEL MODEL
Channel fading plays an important role in the wireless communication; when a signal transmits
through the channel it will encounter various interferences such as the multipath effect when the
signal transmits through the buildings, forests and terrains. The multipath effect will enhance or
fade the transmitted signal to make it is impossible at the receiver terminal to accurately deter-
mine the transmitted signal but by using statistical consideration. The channel model in wireless

3. SYSTEM SIMULATION PARAMETERS
In this section we perform the system performance simulation of LTE system and it also makes
comparison and analysis of the system performances when it has or without coordination scheme
implemented. The system simulation parameters are listed in Table 1. The System Simulation

The users’ service performance and the BS throughput statistics are listed in Table 2.
The total base stations capacity of integrating three base stations with and without repeaters
implemented is shown in Figure 7. It appears that it generates higher BS capacity when repeaters
are implemented in the system.
5. CONCLUSION
When system bandwidth becomes wider in next generation communication systems the users den-
sity in the base stations coverage areas may be varied depending on the communication schedule,
communication environment etc. When the spectrum efficiency becomes worse it could possibly
increase the spectrum efficiency and improve the user’s signal quality when coordination scheme is
implemented. In the outdoor to indoor signal transmission it showed in this paper from simulation
results that the spectrum utilization of the base station had greatly improved when repeaters are
implemented comparing with without using repeaters.

D. The Flow Chart of the System Operation 
As shown in Fig. 3 is the wireless transmission system 
flow chart, it is used to demonstrate the operation of the 
receiver digital circuit. When the receiver receives the 
transmitted signal it is delayed by 7.5 us by the denounce 
circuit and is transmitted to the next stage circuit and it then 
uses the shift register to store the length of the period and to 
determine whether it needs to clear the shift register when the 
counter in the shift register is over 13. When the shift register 
has count of 13 it simultaneously triggers the F check to 
determine the length of the signal is between 265 us to 365 us 
when the counter has count 13. If the length is not in this 
range it outputs a wrong message. If it is then it next counts 
another 13 times signal to have a total of 26 times signal and 
it then generates a 2.5 us pulse signal.  
Fig. 4 is the resulting circuit after the above digital circuit 
has been modified to generate four different types of packet 
format signals as shown in Fig. 5-9. The four different types 
of packet format signals instead of only a fixed format signal 
can be generated in the original circuit but main function of 
the original circuit has been maintained. In Fig. 5 it depicts 
the first type of packet format, it is A session, B session, C 
session and D session respectively considered from the front 
end. The A session is 25 us *60 and is designed as a dynamic 
session that its length can be varied and is used as the control 
signal. Session B = 25 us * 40 and is used to carry the start the 
position of the information message, C session = 25 us *40 to 
carry the end location of the information message and D 
session = 25 us * 120 denotes the end location of the 
transmitted packet. The second format is A session = 25 us * 
90, the third format is A session = 25 us * 120 and the fourth 
format is A session = 25 us * 140 [3]. As shown in Figs. 10 
-13 are the packet length of each digital circuit under various 
packet formats. 
III.  SYSTEM DESIGN AND SIMULATION 
It first uses ModelSim software to simulate our designed 
wireless transmission system, it has the advantages of simple 
in the timing pulse design and also it runs fast in the program 
compilation when using the ModelSim and consequently it is 
fast in the validation of the program in the debugging and 
modifying the programs to save some operating time. 
We used the Pathfinder, a small scale low cost hardware 
system with size of a notebook, developed by GFEC, Taiwan 
as shown in Fig. 14 in the hardware simulation of our 
designed system. The Pathfinder has a built-in Stratrix 
EP1S30 FPGA system, it can simulate around 470000 ASIC 
logic gates and it possess 7.4 Mbits embedded RAM. The 
Pathfinder is a low cost system comparing with the 
simulation system or the large scale prototype system it has 
been considered as the test platform for IC industry. 
The overall Co-Emulation has the process as shown in Fig. 
15. After the whole system has been designed and compiled 
the MapMaker generates the Tcl file that has the format as 
defined by the Pathfinder. The Tcl file is then from the pins 
positions as defined by Pathfinder and is synthesized through 
QuartusII and to the logic circuit of the circuit layer. The 
ModelSim then uses the Wrapper file, generated from 
MarpMarker, to generate the Testbench by adding the signals 
to be tested, it then combines with the synthesized circuit 
generated from Quartus II and this combined signal is 
downloaded and written into Pathfinder. The baseband 
circuit will be written into the actual circuit through Stratix 
30 of the Pathfinder and the Testbench will be through the 
Pathfinder to synthesize the actual signal and to be used to 
test the operation of the circuit; finally the signal passes 
through the circuit will be transmitted back to ModelSim to 
validate the operation of the transmission system through the 
operation of the circuit. 
Finally the designed transceiver is written into the 
Pathfinder to validate its results. As shown in Fig. 16 is the 
simulation result for the first type of the packet signal it has 
exactly the same result as shown in Fig.10. For the test of 
type 2 packet signals it has the results as shown in Fig. 17, it 
is exactly the same as the result shown in Fig. 11. Similarly 
for the tests of type 3 and type 4 packets they have the test 
results as shown in Figs. 18 and 19 respectively, they are 
matched the results as shown before in Fig. 12 and 13 
respectively. 
A. Noise Simulation 
When the transmitted 40 kHz is changed to 100 kHz or to 5 
kHz they have the simulation results as shown in Figs. 10 and 
11 respectively, they prove that if the system has an input 
signal with frequency not as the designed 40 kHz then the 
system will have no output signals. With interference signals 
it has the simulation results as shown in Figs. 12, 13, 16 and 
17. The result in Fig. 14 is the Pathfinder hardware 
manufactured by Galaxy Far East Corp Company and Fig. 15 
is the result of the Co-Emulation of Pathfinder and ModelSim, 
it appears that all interfering signals with frequency below 35 
kHz and above 50 kHz have been filtered by the designed 
system [4][5].  
B. Simulation of the Counter 
As shown in Figs. 18, 19 and 20 are the simulation results 
when the T counter length is 2.5 us*30, 2.5us*20 and 2.5us * 
15 respectively, it will not occur any mis-detection situations. 
But as shown in Fig.21 when the T counter length becomes 
2.5 us * 10 it occurs mis-dections, this is because the 
separation between A session and C session is not far enough 
to have the detection working properly [6]. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we designed a transmission system with 200 
kHz timing pulse and the packet information was transmitted 
at low power and low carrier frequency at 40 kHz. The 
system  
can transmit the information and control signal 
simultaneously at four sessions (session A, session B, session 
C and session D) of test pattern and it completed the wireless 
transmission by adding small amount of analog circuits. In 
the interference test it is found through simulation that the 
signals with rate below 35 kHz or above 50 kHz will be 
filtered by this transmission system. The design was 
developed and Co-simulated through the Verilog hardware

 Abstract—This paper reports a two-dimensional 
time-domain inverse scattering algorithm based upon the 
finite-difference time domain method for determining the 
shape of a perfectly conducting cylinder. Finite difference 
time domain method (FDTD) is used to solve the 
scattering electromagnetic wave of a perfectly conducting 
cylinder. The inverse problem is resolved by an 
optimization approach and the global searching scheme 
dynamic differential evolution (DDE) is then employed to 
search the parameter space. By properly processing the 
scattered field, some electromagnetic (EM) properties 
can be reconstructed. A set of representative numerical 
results is presented to demonstrate that the proposed 
approach is able to efficiently reconstruct the 
electromagnetic properties of metallic scatterer even 
when the initial guess is far away from the exact one.

I. INTRODUCTION 
UMERICAL inverse scattering studies found in the 
literature are based on either frequency or time domain 
approaches. Time domain approaches can exploit causality to 
limit the region of inversion, potentially reducing the number 
of unknowns. Time-domain inverse-scattering problems 
somewhat related to the present study commonly appear in 
the area of geosciences and remote sensing [1]–[2]. The

scatterer reconstruction belongs to the general category of 
limited angle microwave imaging problems. These problems 
are both nonlinear and ill-posed [3]. The ill-posedness is 
often a mathematical characteristic of inverse problems. In 
general, the ill-posedness can be treated by traditional 
regularization schemes or transformed into a better condition 
problem [4]. In the latter possibility a type of regularization is 
also inherent. 
In general, the nonlinearity of the problem is coped with by 
applying iterative optimization techniques [5]-[6]. Those 
algorithms based on stochastic strategies, offer advantages 
relative to local inversion algorithms including strong search 
ability simplicity, robustness, and insensitivity to 
ill-posedness.  
 Some population-based stochastic methods, such as 
genetic algorithm (GA) [7], differential evolution (DE) [8], 
particle swarm optimization (PSO) [8]-[9] are proposed to 
search the global extreme of the inverse problems to 
overcome the drawback of the deterministic methods. To the 
best of our knowledge, there is still no investigation using the 
DDE to reconstruct the electromagnetic imaging of perfectly 
conducting cylinder with arbitrary shape in free space under 
time domain. 
 In this paper, the computational methods combining the 
FDTD method [10] and the DDE algorithm is presented. The 
forward problem is solved by the FDTD method, for which 
the subgridding technique is implemented to closely describe 
the fine structure of the cylinder. The shape of scatterer is 
parameterized by closed cubic spline expansion. The inverse 
problem is formulated into an optimization one and then the 
global searching scheme DDE is used to search the parameter 
space. In section II, the subgridding FDTD method for the 
forward scattering are presented. In sections III and IV, the 
inverse problem and the dynamic differential evolution of the 
proposed inverse problem are given, respectively. In V 
section, the numerical result of the proposed inverse problem 
is given. Finally, in VI section some conclusions are drawn 
for the proposed time domain inverse scattering. 
 
II. FORWARD PROBLEM 
Let us consider a two-dimensional metallic cylinder in a 
free space as shown in Figure 1. The cylinder is parallel to z 
axis, while the cross-section of the cylinder is arbitrary. The 
object is illuminated by a Gaussian pulse line source located 
at the points denoted by Tx and reflected waves are recorded

coefficients of the modified DDE are set as below: The 
operational coefficients are set as below: The crossover rate 
CR is set to be 0.8. Both parameters F  and   are set to be 
0.8. The population size Np is set to be 110. 
 The reconstructed images for the relative error of the third 
example are shown in Fig 2. The shape function of this object 
is given by ( ) 29.75 5.95cos(3 ) 5.95sin(2 )F      mm. 
Figure 3 shows that the relative errors of the shape decrease 
quickly and good convergences are achieved within 30 
generation. The r.m.s. error DF is about 2.8% in the final 
generation.  
 
VI. INVERSE PROBLEM 
In this paper, we study the time domain inverse scattering 
of an arbitrary cross section metallic cylinder in free space. 
By combining the FDTD method and the DDE, good 
reconstructed results are obtained. The inverse problem is 
reformulated into an optimization one, and then the global 
searching scheme DDE is employed to search the parameter 
space. By using the DDE, the shape of the object can be 
successfully reconstructed.
