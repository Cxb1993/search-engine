Abstract—In this paper, we provide comprehensive 
comparison for Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) and 
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) with channel coding or 
not with Minimal Mean Square Error (MMSE) filter or not. 
The following three cases (1) uncoded (2) long code CDMA 
without MMSE filter (3) short code CDMA with MMSE filter 
are not found in the literatures. In the simulation results, we 
find that bit error rate (BER) of the long code CDMA system 
with MMSE filter and scrambling is close to that of the IDMA 
system. The other types of CDMA systems significantly under-
perform the IDMA system. When the number of users increases, 
the IDMA system may have slightly larger bit error rate than 
the long code CDMA system with MMSE filter and scrambling 
at times.

I. INTRODUCTION 
CDMA is mainly limited by Multiple Access Interference 
(MAI), but the iterative decoding and the symbol-by-symbol 
PIC/MMSE filter Multi-User Detection (MUD) scheme that 
used in [1] helps CDMA mitigates MAI. 
Recently, Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) is 
taking a lot of attention [2]-[3]. Unlike CDMA system, 
IDMA uses different interleavers to distinguish each user’s 
signal. The receiver of IDMA does not need MMSE 
instantaneous filter and is achieved by chip-by-chip (CBC) 
estimation algorithm. It’s complexity for each user is 
independent of the user number unlike CDMA. In [3] we can 
find comparison of IDMA and short code CDMA with 
scramble and without MMSE filter, in [4] we find 
comparison of IDMA and long code CDMA with MMSE 
filter.  
In [4], the same framework is used to model both IDMA and 
CDMA since IDMA is a variation of CDMA but with more 
randomness by large-period random chip interleavers. But in 
[3] and [4] they don’t compare (1)uncoded system, (2)long 
code CDMA without MMSE filter and (3)short code CDMA 
with MMSE filter. In this paper, we make comprehensive 
comparisons including the above three cases not found in 
previous papers[3][4]. 
The remainder of this paper is presented as follows. 
Section II presents the system model of IDMA and CDMA. 
Then the receiver with or without MMSE filter operation is in 
Section III. The simulation results are presented in Section IV, 
and we conclude this paper in Section V. 
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
The system models for IDMA and CDMA transmitters are 
shows in Fig. 1, and ][nbk  denotes the information bits 
for user k , k =1,…, K,K is the number of users， n  is the 
index of information bit. Then ][nbk  are encoded by rate 
cR  convolution encoder which generates coded bits 
][' ick ， i  is the index of symbol. For IDMA, the output 
][' ick  is then encoded by the rate pR  repetition code that 
repeats pR  times to form ][' jdk ， j  is the index of chip. 
Then the chip interleaver kπ  permutes ][' jdk  to form 
][ jdk  which is modulated into BPSK symbol ][ jxk . For 
CDMA the output ][' ick  is permuted to ][ick  by symbol 
interleaver kπ ，then modulated into BPSK symbol ][isk . 
][isk  is spread by length Nu spreading code 
]][],...,[[][ ,0, iuiui uNkkk =u  to form ][ jxk ， ][iuk  has 
the symbol index i  so that it may vary over symbols within 
each block.

III. THE ALGORITHM OF RECEIVER 
A.The algorithm for IDMA or  CDMA without MMSE filter: 
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 present the receiver structure of 
uncoded and coded IDMA/ CDMA without MMSE filter, 
respectively. The difference between Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 is that 
the coded one use soft-input soft-output decoder DEC to 
decode and feedback to SPREAD, and uncoded one use 
output of DESPREADER that combing chips LLC of  the 
data symbol, as (8) then feedback to SPREADER. In 
IDMA/CDMA without MMSE filter receiver we use 
Elementary Signal Estimator (ESE)[3] to detect signal as 
follows: 
First, we defined interference from other path and other 
users 
][][][][, jxlgljyj kckclk c −+=ζ                                  (4) 
where j  is the chip index, cl  is the index of chip delay. 
From the central limit theorem, ][, jclkζ  can be 
approximated as Gaussian variable and the conditional 
probability )1][|][( ±=+ jxljyp kc can be characterized 
by a Gaussian probability density function.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In the following simulations, we first observe the BER 
performance of uncoded IDMA and CDMA then illustrate 
the PDF and variance of received signal in Rayleigh fading 
channel. In our simulation we consider total transmit 1000 
blocks,  one block has 128 information bits and encoded by 
rate 1/2 memory 4 convolution code with generator 
polynomial [23, 35]8 ,the trellis for this convolution encoder 
is terminated by 4 zero bits to return to all zero states, and 
thus resulting 256 coded bits. For IDMA , the coded bits are 
repeated by the length 4 repetition code resulting 1024 chips. 
Therefore, the interleaver size of πk is 10244256 =× . The 
length of spreading code for CDMA is 4 random codes for 
number of user K=4 and the interleaver is generated 
randomly and independently for each user. 
Fig. 7 shows BER performance of uncoded IDMA, long 
code and short code CDMA with or without scramble and 
with or without MMSE filter in Rayleigh fading channel, 
path= 8, user K=4, iteration=8. We can observe the long code 
CDMA have as good as performance to IDMA.

Fig. 8 shows the PDF of received signal of uncoded IDMA, 
long code CDMA with and without MMSE filter and short 
code CDMA without MMSE filter. The PDF of IDMA and 
long code CDMA with MMSE filter are approximated, the 
PDF of long code CDMA without MMSE filter is more 
incline to left and the PDF of short code CDMA without 
MMSE filter is more flat than long code CDMA without 
MMSE filter. Table.1 shows that the variance of receive 
signal in uncoded IDMA, long code and short code CDMA, 
in Table.1, the variance of receiver with MMSE filter is 
smaller than the receiver without MMSE filter and the 
smallest variance is IDMA. Corresponding to Fig. 8 and 
Table.1, the smaller variance of received signal and PDF are 
more similar to Gaussian distribution that will have better 
BER performance, so that in Fig. 7, the receiver for CDMA 
with MMSE filter have better BER performance than CDMA 
without MMSE filter. But IDMA without MMSE filter have 
similar PDF and smaller variance to long code CDMA with 
MMSE filter.

CDMA without MMSE filter. The PDF of IDMA is similar 
to long code CDMA with MMSE filter, and we can observe

more similar to Gaussian distribution which will have better

with MMSE filter have better BER performance than CDMA 
without MMSE filter. But IDMA without MMSE filter have

Abstract—In this paper, we study the combination of 
Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) and Code Division 
Multiple Access(CDMA). IDMA is a system that uses different 
interleavers to separate different users, but previously it is not 
combined with CDMA. Simulation results show that the 
combination improve the performance. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The iterative decoding and the symbol-by-symbol 
PIC/MMSE Multi-User Detection (MUD) scheme in [1] help 
CDMA mitigates Multiple Access Interference (MAI). 
Recently, an attractive multiple access system was 
proposed, so called IDMA [2]-[3]. Unlike CDMA system, 
IDMA uses different interleavers to distinguish each user’s 
signal. The MUD of IDMA only applies soft interference 
cancellation without MMSE instantaneous filter and is 
achieved by chip-by-chip (CBC) estimation algorithm, which 
requires significantly less complexity than CDMA, is a very 
low-cost detection scheme, because its MUD estimation’s 
complexity for each user is independent of the user number. 
In this paper, we study the combination of IDMA/CDMA 
which is compared to IDMA only system with the same 
spreading gain. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
We propose the hybrid IDMA/CDMA system in Rayleigh 
fading channel. Block of 32 information bits are encoded by 
rate 1/2 and memory 2 convolutional code with generator 
polynomial [7, 5]8 ,the trellis for this convolutional encoder is 
terminated by 2 zero bits to return to all zero states, and thus 
resulting 68 coded bits. The proposed hybrid IDMA/CDMA 
system has separate spreading gain 8 for IDMA and CDMA 
parts, respectively, and the composite spreading gain is 
8x8=64. For fair comparison, the IDMA only system also has 
spreading gain 64. All interleavers and spreading codes are 
randomly generated. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
Fig. 1 shows that the BER performance. Clearly the 
proposed IDMA/CDMA outperforms the IDMA system.   
Perhaps, the hybrid system
