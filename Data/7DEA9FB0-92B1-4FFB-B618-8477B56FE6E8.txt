Abstract: As the VLSI technology advances into the nanometer era, power consumption becomes a critical issue of 
evaluating a chip system performance. Voltage-island design methodology uses multiple supplying voltages is one of 
efficient ways to reduce overall power consumption. This work proposes an algorithm to complete an X-clock tree that 
connects several voltage-islands. We first construct the X-clock tree for each voltage-island and then combine these 
X-clock trees based on a well-defined connection with inserted level-shifters to reduce power consumption. 
Experimental results show that two- and three-voltage-island-based X-clock trees can save 11.1% and 19.6% in power 
consumption, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Due to the advanced VLSI fabrication technologies, a lot of devices can be implemented on a single chip. Hence, 
power consumption becomes an important issue in nanometer chip design. Nowadays, a system-on-chip (SoC) usually 
has multiple operation frequencies because the required performances of all functional blocks are not the same [1]. The 
voltage-island design methodologies [2-4] assign different supplying voltages to individual functional blocks in a 
system for reducing power consumption. For instance, the performance-critical block (e.g., processor) requires the 
highest supplying voltage and other blocks (e.g., control logics and peripheral units) can operate at lower voltages. For 
transmitting a signal on the different voltage islands, a level-shifter (LS) has to be inserted into the interconnection that 
transmits a signal from a low-voltage island to a high one because a circuit may suffer from excessive leakage energy 
when low voltage gates directly drive high voltage ones [1, 4]. 
Many works addressed the floorplan and placement [8-9] issues of multi-voltage-based designs. However, 
constructing a clock tree that connects all the clock sinks of voltage-islands is a new challenge and has not been 
discussed more. Generally, there are two straight approaches. The first approach is to complete the whole clock tree 
routing, then insert level-shifters for post refinement and compensate clock skew to be zero. Figure 1(a) shows a clock 
tree that connects three voltage-islands (e.g., Islands 1, 2, and 3 respectively operate at 1.0V, 1.1V, and 1.2V). 
Therefore, level-shifters are required for the interconnections from the low-voltage island (Island 1) to other two 
high-voltage islands (Islands 2 and 3). Notably, the clock skew has been refined to be zero. 
Another approach is to route the subclock tree for each voltage-island, then combine all the subclock tree routings to 
be a complete one with level-shifter insertion. Figure 1(b) shows that a clock tree routing combines three subclocks 
(CLK1, CLK2, and CLK3) with two level-shifters those respectively connect Island 1 (1.0V) to Island 2 (1.1V) and 
Island 3 (1.2V). Compared with the first approach shown in Fig. 1(a), the second one can save four level-shifters. 
In this work, we apply the second approach to complete the clock routing on multi-voltage islands. As shown in Fig. 
1(b), the system clock source adopts the voltage of 1.0V of Island 1 and two level-shifters are required for driving 
Islands 2 and 3. That is, two subclocks CLK2 and CLK3 are first combined and then CLK1 is integrated with two 
level-shifters and them. On the other hand, we may select the voltage of 1.1 V of Island 2 as the system clock source, 
such that the subclocks CLK1 and CLK3 are first combined and a level-shifter is inserted when CLK2 is integrated with 
them. Based on the above discussion, we can get that different combinations of subclocks may cause another 
whole-chip clock routing with distinct inserted level-shifters, clock delay, and power consumption. However, delay and

Fig. 3. The proposed MuVIX algorithm. 
In the algorithm, for a given set of voltage-islands, denoted as VI, and a set of supplying voltages, denoted as SV, the 
supplying voltage for the system clock source, denoted as SVsys, is first determined. Then, the PMXF [5] algorithm 
constructs the X-clock tree for each voltage-island belonging to VI and marks these constructed X-clock trees to be leaf 
nodes. To connect the leaf nodes for minimum power consumption of integrating these island-based X-clock trees, all 
the connection sequences of voltage-islands with different combinations, denoted as CS(VI), can be obtained. For a 
connection sequence vi ∈ CS(VI) associated with the SVsys of these islands, level-shifters are required to insert into the 
interface from low-to-high voltage islands. The combination of connection sequences with level–shifter insertion is 
denoted as CS(LS). After that, we combine all the leaf-nodes of island-based X-clock trees and calculate the power 
consumption for each connection sequence ls ∈ CS(LS). Finally, we can get a multi-voltage-island-based X-clock tree 
with the well-defined connection sequence for minimum power consumption. 
A. Determine Supplying Voltage for System Clock Source 
Before constructing the system clock tree that connects all the island-based subclock trees, we define the supplying 
voltage for system clock source SVsys as follows. 
kvisys
SVSV

min
∀
=            (4)  
For each voltage-island vik ∈ VI, vik can operate at several supplying voltages SVk = {sv1, sv2, ...}. In this work, we 
set the lowest supplying voltage of all the islands as the SVsys for the expectation of minimum power consumption, but 
some level-shifters should be required for the interfaces from low-to-high voltage islands. 
B. Construct X-clock Tree for a Voltage-Island 
To construct the X-clock tree for each voltage-island, we apply the PMXF algorithm [5] for it. Given a chip with 
several voltage-islands, as shown in Fig. 4(a), PMXF connects all the clock sinks in one of multi-voltage islands with 
X-architecture routing scheme to complete a subclock tree. Figure 4(b) shows the sub-X-clock tree for Island 2. A 
system clock source enters the clock source of Island 2, denoted as CLK2, to drive all the clock sinks synchronously. 
Here, we let its clock source CLK2 be a leaf-node, denoted as Leaf-node2, and present its supplying voltages as SV2 = 
{sv1, sv2, ...}. Similarly, Leaf-node3 and SV3 respectively represent the clock source and supplying voltage of Island 3.

C. Connection Sequences of Voltage-Islands 
To construct a multi-voltage island-based X-clock tree, we should know how to connect these islands with different 
supplying voltages to achieve minimum power consumption. Because the construction of X-clock tree is based on 
binary tree structure, the combination of connection sequences is k! if there are k leaf-nodes. For the three 
voltage-islands shown in Fig. 4(a), they are labelled as Leaf-node1 for Island 1, Leaf-node2 for Island 2, and Leaf-node3 
for Island 3 with three supplying voltages 1.0V, 1,1V, and 1.2V, respectively. Hence, there are six connection 
sequences (i.e, 3!), denoted as CS(VI) = {vi1, vi2, vi3, vi4, vi5, vi6}. For vi1 ∈ CS(VI) shown in Fig. 5(a), Leaf-node1 and 
Leaf-node2 are connected first and then they are connected with Leaf-node3 to complete the voltage-island-based 
X-clock tree. Figure 5(b) shows the other connection sequence vi6 ∈ CS(VI).

E. Time Complexity Analysis 
For given a set of n clock sinks in a set of m voltage-islands, the proposed MuVIX algorithm shown in Fig. 3 can 
complete the design of multi-voltage-island-based X-clock tree. PMXF [5] constructs the X-clock tree for each 
voltage-island in O(nlogn). For each connection sequence, it takes O(mlogm) to combine m leaf-nodes with inserted 
level-shifters. Because we always determine the lowest supplying voltage as the supplying voltage for system clock 
source, the combination of connection sequences for searching the minimum power consumption is less than m!. 
Moreover, m << n. Hence, the time complexity of MuVIX algorithm is O(nlogn). 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed MuVIX algorithm has been implemented by using the C++ programming language and performed on 
a Windows machine with 2.5GHz Intel processor and 2GB memory. The fabrication parameters of FED delay model [7] 
and level-shifter (LS) under 130nm process are listed in Table I for delay and power calculation. For comparative study, 
the adopted benchmarks contain IBM r1-r5 [10], MCNC Primary1-2 [11], and ISCAS89 s1423, s5378, and s15850 
[12].

In the experiments, the X-clock tree of a given benchmark with single voltage-island is first constructed by using 
PMXF. To design a multi-voltage-island-based X-clock tree, the benchmark is partitioned into several voltage-islands. 
Here, we respectively perform two and three voltage-islands, as shown in Fig. 8. The width (w) and height (h) of 
benchmarks are listed in the second column of Table II. After partitioning, we use PMXF to connect the clock sinks in 
each voltage-island and to construct the island-based sub-X-clock trees. Then, we determine the connection sequence of 
islands associated with the different supplying voltages to achieve minimum power consumption. Finally, all the 
island-based sub-X-clock trees are merged to a new one and the level-shifters are inserted if the clock signal is 
delivered from a low-voltage island to a high-voltage island.

delay, respectively, but more wirelength by 2.9% is required.

Moreover, we construct the three-voltage-island-based X-clock trees and compare the results with single-voltage 
ones, as listed in Table III. When a benchmark is partitioned into three voltage-islands, there are six (i.e., 3!) connection 
sequences for these islands. Therefore, the best and worst results in power consumption, delay, and wirelength are 
reported. Compared with single-voltage-island-based X-clock trees, the worst case of three-voltage-island-based 
X-clock trees averagely achieves the improvements of 14.3% and 19% in power consumption and delay, respectively, 
but more wirelength by 4.5% is required. For the best result of three-voltage-island-based X-clock trees, it averagely 
saves up to 19.6% in power consumption, but more delay and wirelength by 2.7% and 2.6% are respectively required.
