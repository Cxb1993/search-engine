ABSTRACT 
 
The channel statistics are analyzed and evaluated 
for cooperative selection diversity with an amplify-
and-forward (A&F) relay over Rayleigh fading 
channels. The average level crossing rate (LCR) and 
average fade duration (AFD) of the signal envelope for 
the dual-hop path and the cooperative selection 
diversity are evaluated. The moment generating 
function (MGF) of the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and 
the amount of fading (AOF) are derived, and the 
symbol error rate (SER) of different modulation 
schemes are evaluated. Numerical results of are 
presented for performance examinations.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In wireless communication systems, the 
cooperative diversity with relays can be 
employed to enhance the receiver performance. 
In [1], the receiver performance was analyzed 
for both the non-regenerative A&F and the 
regenerative decode-and-forward relays with 
varying relay gains, where the maximal ratio 
combining was employed to process the signal 
from the cooperative diversity paths. For the 
relay with a normalized relay gain [1], the state 
information of the channel between the source 
and the destination must be estimated 
continuously, which results in a varying-gain 
relay and may be not realizable in practice. For 
the consideration of fixed-gain relays, the dual-
hop path on Rayleigh fading channels has been 
studied in [2]. In [3], the outage-optimal 
opportunistic relaying was addressed. In [4], it 
has been proved that the outage probability is 
minimized with the strategy of the single-relay 
selection. 
On the other hand, the average LCR and AFD 
of the signal envelope are important second-
order statistics for the design and simulations of 
wireless communication systems [5]. For 
example, if a cooperative diversity system 
employs the adaptive modulation on a fast 
fading channel, the value of the LCR and/or 
AFD can be used as a decision criterion for 
changing the modulation level. The average 
LCR and AFD for selection diversity without 
cooperative relays have been addressed for 
Rayleigh fading channels in many literatures 
(e.g. [6]). To analyze the second-order channel 
statistics over the dual-hop path, the LCR of the 
signal transmitted via dual hops has been 
evaluated in [7], where complex integrations are 
needed to evaluate the average LCR or the AFD. 
In this report, the non-regenerative A&F relay 
is considered for the cooperative selection 
diversity over the Rayleigh fading channel. 
Although the maximal ratio combining (MRC) 
or the equal-combining (EGC) may achieve a 
better receiver performance, the power-
consumption and implementation complexity of 
the MRC and EGC at the destination are much

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
In the numerical illustrations, for 
simplification, the symmetric case is considered, 
where 0 1 2 ,γ γ γ γ= = = 0 1 2 ,λ λ λ λ= = =  and 
thus 2 2 2 20 1 2 .σ σ σ σ= = =  Let / .η λ γ=  The 
average SERs of BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM are 
plotted in Fig. 2 with 3dB,η = where the 
dashed-lines are the results of the cooperative 
selective diversity, the solid-lines are from using 
the direct path alone, and the dotted-lines are 
from using the dual-hop channel.  In Fig. 3, the 
AOF versus the fading parameter 22σ  for the 
three different channels are compared, where the 
cooperative selection diversity results in the 
least AOF. The illustrations in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 
disclose that the cooperative selection diversity 
can effectively enhance the receiver 
performance. 
The average LCR and AFD of the dual-hop 
path and the cooperative selection diversity as 
well as their corresponding bounds are all 
dependent on .η  The normalized AFD of the 
dual-hop path is presented in Fig. 4. The 
normalized average LCR and the normalized 
AFD of the cooperative selection diversity are 
plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively. Notice 
that, for the cooperative selection diversity, the 
bounds on the average LCR and AFD yield very 
good estimates, where the bounds and the exact 
average LCR and AFD almost merge at some 
values of thresholds. From Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, we 
observe that the selection diversity can 
effectively reduce the AFD for most values of 
the envelope thresholds, which will improve the 
receiver performance at the destination. 
Although only the selection diversity over the 
Rayleigh fading channel is addressed in the 
context, the method used to derive the upper 
bound and the lower bound for the evaluation of 
the average LCR and the AFD can also be 
employed to analyze the second-order statistics 
of other cooperative diversity schemes over 
general fading models.
