Abstract 
A lot of tasks require fast computation for real-time response or processing a great 
volume of data sets. These tasks include weather forecasting, aerodynamic simulations, 
chemical-reaction simulations and image processing. Parallel processing of data sets can be 
used to increase processing speed significantly. A parallel processing system comprised of a 
multitude of tightly coupled processors and memory modules connected by an 
interconnection network. The performance characteristics of different interconnection 
networks vary from each other. An interconnection network might support one application 
well but might prove inefficient for others. We need an approach to find a cost-effectiveness 
solution for an assigning application. 
The memory reference models also affect the performance of an interconnection 
network. The performance of the same interconnection network varies with different 
memory reference models. Multiprocessor designers need analytical techniques to evaluate 
the performance of interconnection networks under various memory reference models. An 
important research problem needs to be solved is the combined effect of multiple memory 
reference models. This project is intended to propose new analytical models for precisely 
evaluating the performance of interconnection networks under multiple memory reference 
models.  
Keyword: multiprocessor, parallel processing, interconnection networks, memory reference 
model, performance analysis, simulation.

Abstract: In a tightly coupled multiprocessor system, the processors and memory modules are connected via an interconnection 
network. In each time unit, the processors can make request to one of the memory modules. When two or more processors attempt to 
access the same memory module, only one request can be accepted. The bandwidth, which is defined as the expected number of 
requests accepted per unit time, is the most common performance parameter used in analyzing the multiprocessor systems. The 
performance/bandwidth of a multiprocessor system is influenced by the processor-to-memory request/reference pattern, i.e., memory 
reference model. Several analyses were reported for different memory reference models, including uniform and hot-spot. The focus of 
this study is the effect of another interesting phenomenon, Pareto principle, which means that a certain ratio of the requests is intended 
for the significant few groups of memory modules. By using simulation, the paper tries to find the performance characteristics of 
multiprocessor systems with Pareto phenomenon. 
Keywords: Pareto principle, simulation, bandwidth, multiprocessor systems, memory reference model. 
1. Introduction 
In a tightly coupled multiprocessor system, the processors are connected via an interconnection network (IN) to the memory 
modules such that the memory modules are shared by all processors in the system. A crossbar interconnection network supports all 
possible distinct connections between processors and memory modules simultaneously. When two or more processors attempt to 
access the same memory module, a memory conflict occurs and only one request can be accepted while all the others are blocked. The 
bandwidth -- defined as the expected number of requests accepted per unit time -- is the most common performance parameter used in 
analyzing the multiprocessor systems (Bhuyan et al., 1989; Feng, 1981). Surveys of analytic models of the crossbar interconnected 
multiprocessors can be found in Bhuyan et al. (1989) and Marsan et al. (1986, Ch. 6). 
Previous analyses (Atiquzzaman and Banat, 1993; Atiquzzaman and Sayeed, 1994; Awdeh and Mouftah, 1993; Bhuyan, 
1985; Chang and Yuan, 1993; Patel, 1981; Pombortsis and Halatsis, 1988) simply assume that the blocked requests are discarded. 
Thus, the successive requests generated by a processor are assumed to be independent of each other. Although this approach simplifies 
the analysis, in practice, a blocked request must be re-sent in the next memory cycle (Liu and Wang, 1989). However, Liu and Wang 
only consider the uniform reference model (URM) in their work. 
The accessing of memory records is not necessary random (uniform); the distribution may have an 80/20 distribution (also 
known as the Pareto Principle). Pareto (1909) observes that approximately 80% of wealth is in the hands of about 20% of a population; 
and this 80/20 phenomenon has been reported in many kinds of human activities. For example, in libraries 80% of circulation 
activities involve only 20% of holdings. Similarly, 80% of computer usage involves only 20% of the available resources (Heising 
1953). The 80/20 rule does not specifically claim that all distributions should follow this fixed number, but rather, it is an observation 
that the majority of usage is by a minority population. The Pareto Curve (sometimes called the Pareto Diagram) shows the cumulative 
responses plotted in the descending rank order of their frequencies (Berenson and Levin 1999). Therefore, we pick a point on the 
‧ ri = R, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ M. 
‧ pij = 1/N, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ M and 1 ≤ j ≤ N. 
‧ cij = ripij = R/N, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ M and 1 ≤ j ≤ N. 
3.2 Pareto Principle 
In general, the Pareto principle states that a% of processor (-to-memory) request are concentrated at b% of memory modules (a + 
b = 100, though not implying a complement). Then, for i = 1,…,M,

If we let a = b = 50, then, pij = 1/N, ∀ i = 1,…,M and j = 1,…,N. That is, URM is a special case of Pareto principle. 
4. Numerical Results and Discussion 
In Table 1, the bandwidth is shown to have a skew distribution (that is, follows the general sense of Pareto Principle) for 10 x 10, 
20 x 20, 30 x 30, ..., 100 x 100 crossbar multiprocessors, respectively. For each pair of M, N and h, the simulation is run one time. 
Each time the simulation runs 105 memory cycles. The simulate result is as follows (Fig. 1, Table1). 
(1) When the size of crossbar increases, the Bandwidth enhances along. For example, when the teaching hour increases, the 
students’ dedicated degree also increases. 
(2) From gradually elevates 90/10 to 50/50 slopes. Although each slope is different, if we must pursue the same bandwidth, the 
same bandwidth may be achieved as long as the size of crossbar may continuously promote. Therefore, if 50/50 wants to 
pursue 10 of the bandwidth, the size of crossbar needs to promote to 20 then the result will be achieved. However, if 90/10 
also wants to pursue that bandwidth is 10, the size of crossbar promotes to 100. It may also be achieved.
