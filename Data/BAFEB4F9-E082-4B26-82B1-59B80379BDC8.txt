critical fluid extraction and distillation of RBO have indi-
cated that the quality of the extracted oil is superior to
that extracted by Soxhlet n-hexane extraction. Kuk et al.
[17] obtained a maximal oil yield of 20.4% using a SC-CO2
extraction of rice bran powder at 62 MPa and 373 K. Ram-
say et al. [18] examined the 5wt% ethanol modified SC-
CO2 extraction of RBO and showed that the total oil yield
was 18.23% at 30 MPa and 348 K. This work studies the
SC-CO2 extraction of RBO from powdered rice bran,
which used a response surface methodology to search for
the optimal extraction conditions.
2 Experimental
2.1 Reagents andmaterials
A local rice bran producer (Taichung, Taiwan) donated
10 kg of fresh rice bran powder, which was stored in a
cooler at 269 K before use. The water content of this rice
bran powder was estimated to be less than 10%, as deter-
mined using a moisture meter (A&D, AD-4714A, Japan).
De-ionized water was obtained using a Milli-Q reverse
osmosis purification system (Millipore, USA). Analytical
grade reagents – 99.95% CO2 (Toyo gas, Taiwan), 99.7%
nitrogen (Toyo), 99.8% hydrogen (Toyo), 99% air (Toyo),
99.9% n-hexane (Mallinckrodt, USA), 99.9% methanol
(Mallinckrodt), 99.9% dichloromethane (Mallinckrodt),
99.9% ACN (J.T. Baker, USA), 99.8% acetic acid (Merck, Ger-
many) and 95% ethanol (Taiwan Sugar, Taiwan), were
purchased from a local supplier and used without treat-
ment. Authentic standards, including 95% mixed stand-
ard c-oryzanols (Wako, Japan) and a fatty acid methyl
esters standard (Supelco, USA), were used herein for
quantification.
2.2 Quantification of c-oryzanols, FFA and
triglycerides
HPLC quantifications of four c-oryzanols (cycloartenyl
ferulate, 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate, campesteryl
ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate) and three FFA (oleic acid,
linoleic acid and linolenic acid) were performed using a
RP analytical column (YMC RP-18, 5 lm, 25064.6
mm id). The column was linked to a UV/Vis detector (L-
4200H, Hitachi, Japan) by an intelligent pump (L-7100,
Hitachi) and software was used to control the interface
(D-7000, Hitachi). The column temperature was main-
tained at 313 K using a column oven (TCM-004657,
Waters-Millipore, USA). The UV absorptions of samples
were detected at wavelengths of 330 and 210 nm for four
c-oryzanols and three FFA. The injection volume of the
sample was 20 lL. Amobile phase consisting of 90% ACN,
6% dichloromethane and 4% acetic acid was used for the
c-oryzanols quantification. Another mobile phase con-
sisting of 85% ACN, 5% methanol and 10% de-ionized
water with 1% acetic acid was used to quantify three FFA.
All R-square correlation coefficients of the calibration
curves of four c-oryzanols and three FFA were at least
0.999. The concentration range of the calibration curve
of four c-oryzanols and three FFA were 29.41–499.05 lg/
gsolution and 58.07–714.8 lg/gsolution, respectively. The LOD
for four oryzanols and three FFA were in the range of
0.125–0.513 lg/gsolution and 0.375–0.545 lg/gsolution,
respectively.
The methylation was performed by weighing 0.1 g of
the extracted oil and placing it in 50 mL test tube, where
it was mixed with 2 mL of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide meth-
anol solution. The test tube was vortexed and placed in a
373 K water bath for 5 min for saponification (cleaving
the chain of lipids and converting it to sodium salts).
Then, 2 mL of 14% boron trifluoride (Sigma-Aldrich)
methanol solution was added to the test tube, which was
then incubated in a water bath for 15 min at 343 K. The
solution was cooled to room temperature and then 8 mL
ethyl ether (Mallinckrodt) and 2 mL sodium chloride of
saturated solution was added. Finally, the solution was
placed at room temperature to allow phase separation.

extracted solution was collected and the solvent was
removed using a vacuum rotary evaporator. The residue
was weighed and stored at 273 K before use. The total
yield, the extraction efficiency and the concentration fac-
tor of c-oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides in the extracts
were then calculated. In this study, a three-level, three-
factor RSM experimental design with a central compo-
site scheme was employed to find the three-dimensional
response of dependent variables on the basis of the
change of independent variables. Total oil yield, extrac-
tion efficiency and concentration factor of components
in the extract were considered as responses. A quadratic
polynomial equation including an individual term of
mean, linear, and cross-product coefficients was used as
the regression model for each response. This model was
determined from the F testing and analysis of variance.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Classical solvent extraction
Table 1 presents the total yield of the extract, the
extracted amount (Wory, WFFA, WTG), the extraction effi-
ciencies (Rory, RFFA, RTG) and the concentration factor (bory,
bFFA, bTG) of c-oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides, obtained
by Soxhlet solvent extractions. The maximal concentra-
tions of c-oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides in the Soxhlet
n-hexane extracted oil were 15.2 mg/gRBO (mg c-oryzanols/
g RBO), 95 mg/gRBO (mg FFA/g RBO) and 800 mg/gRBO (mg
triglycerides/g RBO), respectively. Extracted amounts of
c-oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides in rice bran powder
reached 3.03 mg/gRB, 19.01 mg/gRB and 160 mg/gRB after
4 h of the 300 mL Soxhlet n-hexane extraction of 15 g
rice bran powder. These data were regarded as represent-
ing 100% recovery of c-oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides
from rice bran powder.
3.2 SC-CO2 extraction of RBO
Parameters that potentially affect SC-CO2 efficiency
include CO2 flow rate, extraction time, temperature,
pressure and the ratio of CO2 to rice bran powder (SSR). A
series of preliminary sensitivity tests were performed by
varying the amount of rice bran powder from 10 to 35 g;
varying the CO2 flow rate from 6 g CO2/min to 14 g CO2/
min, and varying the SSR from 40 to 120 g. Experimental
data obtained in these tests indicated that the amount of
rice bran powder, the amount of CO2 consumed and the
CO2 flow rate significantly influence the total oil yield
and the extraction efficiencies (Rory, RFFA, RTG) at 350 bar
and 313 K. Table 1 presents experimental data obtained
in preliminary tests associated with the down-flow and
top-flow SC-CO2 extractions of RBO. The down-flow proc-
ess was generally used for extracting high-density com-
pounds, but the up-flow process was used for extracting
low-density compounds.

that of temperature. Figure 5 (D) shows that the extrac-
tion efficiency of FFA decreased as pressure increased,
reaching 104 mg/g oil (i. e. 10.4 wt%) at 350 bar and 333 K
(Exp. No. 9 in Table 2). Temperature did not consistently
affect the extraction of FFA from the oil. Figures 6 (A), (B)
and (C) show that the concentration factors of oryzanols
and triglycerides (bory, bTG) increased with the increasing
pressure, but the concentration factors of FFA (bFFA)
decreased as the pressure increased. Nevertheless, the
concentration factors of oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides
in this down-flow SC-CO2extraction were similar to those
in Soxhlet n-hexane extraction.
3.5 Experimentally designed up-flow SC-CO2
extraction
Table 3 presents experimental data on the RSM-designed
up-flow SC-CO2 extractions of RBO from 35 g rice bran
powder at temperatures from 313 K to 333 K and pres-
sures from 250 bar to 350 bar. The effects of these two
factors on the extraction efficiencies and the concentra-
tion factors seem to be of the same order of magnitude.
Figures 7 (A), (B), and (C) show that the total oil yield,
extraction efficiency of c-oryzanols (Rory) and extraction
efficiency of triglycerides (RTG) reached maxima of 19.6,
94.4 and 94.6%, respectively, at 350 bar and 333 K (Exp.
No. 9 in Table 3), and increased with pressure. However,
the effect of temperature was not strong. Figure 7 (D)
shows that the extraction efficiency of FFA fell as the
pressure increased, falling to 96.8 mg/g oil (i. e. 9.68%) at
350 bar and 333 K. The low concentration of FFA at high
pressure extraction may be explained by the high yield
of other components in the extracted oil. Figure 8 plots
the concentration factors of oryzanols and triglycerides
(bory, bTG). Figures 8 (A) and (B) show that it increased with
the increasing pressure, but the concentration factor of
FFA (bFFA) decreased as shown in Figure 8 (C). The concen-
tration factors of oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides in up-
flow SC-CO2 extraction exceeded that in Soxhlet n-hexane
extraction. In summary, the extraction efficiencies of
oryzanols, FFA and triglycerides in the up-flow SC-CO2
extraction were higher than those in down-flow SC-CO2
extraction.
4 Conclusions
This work studied the down-flow and up-flow SC-CO2
extractions of oryzanol-enriched RBO from rice bran
powder. The total oil yield, the extraction efficiencies of
oryzanols, triglycerides and FFA and the concentration
factors in the extractions were obtained. An RSM with
varying pressures and temperatures in down-flow and
up-flow SC-CO2 extractions indicated that varying pres-
sure is more effective than varying temperature at
enhancing the extraction efficiency of oil components.

Abstract
This study examined pilot-scale extraction and lab-scale deacidification of rice bran oil by using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). Two
purest gamma-oryzanols (-oryzanols) (>98 wt%) were initially obtained by preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction at 300 bar and 313 K from 1.03 kg powdered rice bran indicated a total yield of oil of 15.7% with a free fatty
acids content of 3.75%, obtained from 20.5 kg of carbon dioxide in 8 h. In the SC-CO2 deacidification, pressure ranged from 200 bar to 300 bar,
temperature ranged from 343 K to 363 K and consumption of carbon dioxide ranged from 900 g to 2700 g: the efficiency of removal of free fatty
acids from 13 g extracted oil in deacidification at 250 bar and 353 K reached 97.8% using 2700 g of carbon dioxide. Finally, three-factor center
composite scheme of response surface methodology was employed in designing a SC-CO2 deacidification system, which demonstrated that the
pressure and consumption of carbon dioxide are significant in retaining triglycerides and in removing free fatty acids from rice bran oil.

1. Introduction
Rice bran consists of 11–15% proteins, 34–62% carbo-
hydrates, 7–11% crude fibers, 7–10% ashes and 15–20%
lipids, which are a by-product of the rice-refining process [1].
This material comprises nutritional and non-nutritional com-
pounds that benefit humans. Rice bran oil contains 95.6%
saponifiable lipids, including glycolipid and phospholipids; and
4.2% unsaponifiable lipids, including tocopherols, tocotrienols,
gamma-oryzanol (-oryzanols), sterols and carotenoids [2]. The
saponifiable lipids are mainly triglycerides. However, these
triglycerides are easily hydrolyzed by lipase to form free fatty
acids.
The -oryzanols content in the rice bran oil is approximately
1.8–3%, according to the experimental data of Hu et al. [3].
Xu and Godber [4] adopted a low-pressure normal phase-silica
column to obtain oryzanols-containing fractions, which were

further partitioned using a preparative normal phase HPLC
column. They have reported that 10 molecular structures of -
oryzanols were identified using a reverse-phase HPLC column
that is coupled with a GC–mass chromatograph. Cycloartenyl
ferulate, 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate and campesteryl fer-
ulate are evidently major -oryzanols in rice bran. -Oryzanols
have certain biological and physiological abilities, such as anti-
oxidation [5], anti-blood cholesterol [6] and anti-carcinogenic
[7–10]. The LC–MS/MS method has been frequently adopted in
elucidating the structures of -oryzanols [11]. Sto¨ggl et al. iden-
tified and quantified tocopherols, -oryzanols and cartenoids
in rice bran [12]. Aguilar-Garcia et al. performed a biological
study of the correlation between the quantities of -oryzanols
and anti-oxidant capacity [13].
The edible rice bran oil only allows a maximal acid value of
0.2, in general equivalent to 0.1 wt% free fatty acid. The Indian
regulation for the refined rice bran oil allows a maximal acid
value of 0.5, which is equivalent to 0.25 wt% free fatty acid [14].
Triglycerides in the wasted rice bran oil had been processed into
biodiesel by acid-catalyzed trans-esterification [15]. In recent
years, supercritical fluid extractions of powdered rice bran have

1% acetic acid was used to analyze the free fatty acids. The R-
square correlation coefficients of the calibration curves of both
-oryzanols and free fatty acids exceeded 0.99. The limits of
detection of -oryzanols and free fatty acids were 0.125g/g
and 0.545g/g, respectively.
GC quantification of seven triglycerides was performed using
a non-polar capillary column (007-CW, Quadrex, USA) in a gas
chromatographer (GC-14B, Shimadzu, Japan). The column tem-
perature was initially set to 443 K, and programmed to increase
to 488 K at 5 K/min, then to 496 K at 2 K/min, and finally to

2.5. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of rice bran oil
Fig. 2 displays a schematic flow diagram of pilot-scale SC-
CO2 extraction of rice bran oil from powdered rice bran. A mass
of rice bran powder varying from 0.6 kg to 1 kg was individually
packed inside a 5 L stainless steel tubular extractor. Liquid CO2
from a cylinder (1) was passed through a chiller (3) at 277 K, and
was compressed to the desired working pressure using a high-
pressure pump (2) and heated to supercritical conditions using
a pre-heater (6-1). This carbon dioxide flowed into the extractor
(7); came into contact with the rice bran powder, and was used
to extract the oil. A heating circulator (9-1) was maintained at
a constant temperature; a metering valve (12-5) located at the
outlet was manually adjusted to maintain constant extraction
pressure. A drop in the pressured drove the oil-laden CO2 into a
1 L separator (8) following the extraction. The SC-CO2 extract
then precipitated in a separator that was maintained at 50 bar and
308 K. The amount of low-pressure CO2 was measured using a
wet gas meter (10) and thus returned to the ambient conditions.
At the end of each experiment, the extracted oil was collected
through a metering valve (13-3). The oil was weighed and stored
at 273 K before use. The total yield, the extraction efficiency,
the concentration factors of -oryzanols, free fatty acids and
triglycerides in the extracts were then calculated.
2.6. Supercritical carbon dioxide deacidiﬁcation of rice
bran oil
Fig. 3 presents a schematic flow diagram of the SC-CO2
deacidification of rice bran oil. The  type stainless steel packed
material was directly loaded into a 275 mL (2.2 cm I.D. × 75 cm
L) high-pressure distillation column (8). Then, 13 g of the rice
bran oil obtained from the SC-CO2 extraction at 300 bar and
313 K was loaded and prepared for the SC-CO2 deacidification.
Liquid CO2 from a cylinder (1) was passed through a cool-
ing bath (3) at 277 K, preheated by a hot plate (6) through an
oil bath (7), and was compressed using a syringe pump (4).
This carbon dioxide, maintained at a flow rate of 10 g/min,
flowed into the deacidification column whose pressure was
maintained by a back-pressure regulator (9-1). A heating ele-
ment, equipped with a PID temperature controller (16), was
thermo-statically maintained at a constant temperature. Fol-
lowing SC-CO2 deacidification, a drop in pressure drove the
acid-laden CO2 into a separator (12), and the gas was then
expanded through a spiral-type nozzle at 50 bar. The amount
of low-pressure CO2 was measured using a wet gas meter (14)
before the gas was returned to the ambient conditions. Follow-
ing this process, the deacidified oil was collected in a flask (13)
after depressurization using a metering valve (11-3) and was
then ready for analysis and calculation. In addition, the free fatty
acids-enriched extracted oil was also collected in the sample vial
by opening a metering valve (11-2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Three puriﬁed γ-oryzanols
The 99% pure cycloartenyl ferulate was purchased from a
chemicals supplier. The 98.5% pure 24-methylenecycloartanyl
ferulate and the 98% pure campesteryl ferulate were obtained
by semi-preparative HPLC chromatography. Fig. 4(a)–(c)
shows the 1H NMR chemical shifts of cycloartenyl ferulate,
24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate and campesteryl ferulate,
respectively. The 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate chemical
shifts pattern obtained using 1H NMR in CDCl3, δ was 7.60
(d, J = 15.8 Hz), 7.08 (dd, J = 1.8, 8.1 Hz), 7.04 (d, J = 1.8 Hz),
6.92 (d, J = 8.4 Hz), 6.30 (d, J = 16.1 Hz), 5.85 (br s), 4.72
(br s), 4.71 (m), 4.67 (br s), 3.94 (s), 2.24 (sept., J = 7.0 Hz),
1.04 (d, J = 7.0 Hz), 1.03 (d, J = 6.6 Hz), 0.98 (s), 0.92 (s), 0.9
(d, J = 5.5 Hz), 0.9 (s), 0.60 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, endo) and 0.37 (d,
J = 4.0 Hz, exo). The campesteryl ferulate chemical shifts pattern
revealed by 1H NMR in CDCl3, δ was 7.60 (d, J = 15.8 Hz), 7.07
(dd, J = 1.8, 8.4 Hz), 7.03 (d, J = 1.8 Hz), 6.91 (d, J = 8.4 Hz),
6.28 (d, J = 16.1 Hz), 5.84 (br s), 5.40 (m), 4.71 (m), 3.92
(s), 2.41 (br s), 2.39 (br s), 1.05 (s), 0.92 (d, J = 6.6 Hz), 0.85
(d, J = 6.2 Hz), 0.81 (d, J = 6.8 Hz), 0.78 (d, J = 6.6 Hz) and
0.69 (s). Yasukawa et al. reported these three NMR patterns
[7].

first batch of rice bran. The #1 feed was fresh and the other two
feeds were aged for 6 months. The #4 fresh feed was from the
second batch of rice bran. The aging process by the lipase trans-
formation at room temperature results in relatively high content
of free fatty acids in the rice bran oil. The maximal concentra-
tion of -oryzanols in the oil extracted from these four samples
was 15.2 mg/goil, after in 4 h of the 300 mL Soxhlet n-hexane
extraction of 15 g rice bran. Triglycerides and free fatty acids
are two major components in the extracted oil. Table 1 indicates
that the summation of these two compounds reached 90%. The
lowest content of free fatty acids 38.9 mg/goil, was found in the
fourth extracted oil.
3.3. SC-CO2 extractions of rice bran oil
Table 2 presents experimental data on the SC-CO2 extraction
of rice bran oil from 35 g of rice bran powder. The oils extracted
in Experiments #1 and #2 in Table 2 were produced from the first
and fourth feed materials in Table 1, respectively. Total oil yield
exceeded 16% upon extraction at 300 bar and 313 K when 2450 g
of carbon dioxide was used. Table 3 presents experimental data
on the SC-CO2 extraction of rice bran oil from 0.6 kg to 1.03 kg
of powder. The total oil yield exceeded 15% upon extraction at
300 bar and 313 K using a constant solvent-to-feed ratio of 20.
The concentrations of -oryzanols, free fatty acids and triglyc-
erides remain unchanged. The oil extracted in Experiment #4
was used for following SC-CO2 deacidifications.
3.4. Experimentally designed SC-CO2 deacidiﬁcations of
rice bran oil
A center composite scheme of pressure, temperature and CO2
consumption of response surface methodology (RSM), config-
ured with six axial points, eight factor points and one center
point, was designed for the SC-CO2 deacidification of 13 g of
rice bran oil, obtained in Experiment #4, as indicated in Table 3.
The flow rate of CO2 was constant at 10 g/min and the height
of the packed column was fixed at 45 cm with 67.5 g of pack-
ing material. Table 4 displays experimental data on this RSM
designed SC-CO2 deacidification at pressures from 200 bar to
300 bar and temperatures from 343 K to 333 K, using 900 g to
2700 g of carbon dioxide.
In SC-CO2 deacidification experiments, the amount of
remaining triglycerides and the removal efficiencies of free fatty
acids are two major variables of interest. The free fatty acid con-
tent, 0.13%, in the deacidified oil was obtained at 250 bar, 353 K
and 2700 g of CO2 extraction. This experiment demonstrated
that the retention efficiency of oil and the removal efficiency of
free fatty acids were 82.2% and 97.8%, respectively. The prod-
uct of these two responses reached 80.4, which is the highest
value among all 15 RSM experiments. Further examination of
these data revealed that the concentration factors of oryzanols
and triglycerides increased, but the concentration factors of free
fatty acids decreased to zero (datum #9), implying that active
compounds in the deacidified oil were concentrated and the free
fatty acid content in the oil was substantially decreased.

Fig. 7. Response surface methodology optimization of the multiple value of oil retention and free fatty acids removal efficiency responses (F-testing: R2 = 0.9451,
S.D. = 4.04). (a) WCO2 : 2160 g, (b) temperature: 363 K, and (c) pressure: 260 bar.
Fig. 5 shows that effects of pressure and the amount of con-
sumed CO2 are important to the removal efficiency of free fatty
acids. Fig. 6 reveals that the effect of pressure is more signifi-
cant than that of CO2 consumption. The effect of temperature is
insignificant because the operative region is close to the cross-
over pressure and the solubility of triglycerides in supercritical
carbon dioxide increases as the fluid density increases with pres-
sure. Fig. 7 plots the effects of the pressure and CO2 consumption
associated with a multiple response of the retention of oil and
the FFA removal efficiency. The value of this response is opti-
mal at 260 bar, 363 K and with 2160 g of CO2 consumed. The
CO2 consumption and pressure both affect the retention of oil
and the removal of free fatty acids.
4. Conclusions
The purest 24-methylenecycloartanyl ferulate and
campesteryl ferulate were successfully isolated from a mixture
of -oryzanols using a preparative C18 high-performance
liquid chromatography method. The 15.7% of rice bran oil was
obtained by using a pilot-scale SC-CO2 extraction at 300 bar
and 313 K, the recovery of extracted oil was 94.0%, which was
close to that by using a lab-scale SC-CO2 extraction at the same
operation conditions. The oryzanol and free fatty acid contents
in the extracted oil were 0.63% and 3.75%, respectively. An oil
retention efficiency of 82.2% and an FFA removal efficiency of
97.8% were achieved using SC-CO2 deacidification at 250 bar
and 353 K with 2700 g of CO2 consumed. The three-factor
center composite designed SC-CO2 deacidifications of rice
bran oil demonstrate that carbon dioxide consumption and
pressure significantly influence the removal efficiency of free
fatty acids and the retention efficiency of triglycerides.

This study elucidates supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) anti-solvent precipitation of 3, 5-diprenyl-
4-hydroxycinnamic acid (DHCA) from the ethyl acetate solution of ultra-green Brazilian propolis. The
SC-CO2 anti-solvent process at 20MPa and 328K generated the precipitates containing DHCA (306mg/g)
more than that of the Soxhlet ethyl acetate extract (204mg/g). A two factorial central composite response
surface methodology was adopted to examine the effects of CO2 ﬂow rate and CO2 expansion volume
on mean particle size of the precipitate. Analysis of the DHCA recovered indicated that both factors are
signiﬁcant. The mean particle size fell as the CO2 ﬂow rate or the CO2 volume increased. Finally, the dose-
dependent concentrations from 25 to 400g/mL demonstrated that aqueous samples of the precipitated
SC-CO2 particulates effectively inhibited the growth of human colon (colo-205) cancer cells.

1. Introduction
Propolis is a resinous product collected from bee hives and
gathered by honey bees from various plant exudates. This prod-
uct is composed of 45% resins, 30% waxes and fatty acids, 10%
essential oils, 5% pollens and 10% organic compounds and minerals
[1]. Propolis has been utilized in folk medicine for several years,
especially in Europe and Japan, because of its various therapeu-
tic activities, including antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inﬂammatory,
antioxidant, immunomodulatory, free radical scavenging, and hep-
atoprotective [2–6].
A few bioactive compounds in propolis are ﬂavonoids and
phenolic acids as well as derivatives, which include two major
anti-cancer materials—caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and
3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (DHCA). Numerous recent
studieshave reportedon thebiological properties of theDHCAcom-
pound, especially those associated with the inhibition of growth
of cancer cells, such as human leukemia and colon cells [7–11].
DHCA exhibits an anti-oxidative activity toward normal cells and
an excellent inhibitory effect on growth of grams-positive bacte-
ria such as Staphylococcus aureus [12–15]. Bohlmann and Jakupovic
were the ﬁrst to identify the DHCA compound, which exclusively

exists in Brazilian propolis [16,17]. In recent year, various super-
green approaches that are based on the use of supercritical ﬂuids
have been applied on propolis to yield high valuable products. Stahl
et al. ﬁrst removed wax using SC-CO2 extraction to enhance the
concentration of ﬂavonoids in the extract [18]. You et al. increased
the amount of ﬂavonoids inwater-soluble propolis by using SC-CO2
extraction [19]. Wang et al. obtained the antioxidant components
frompropolis by SC-CO2 fractionation [20]. Catchpole et al. concen-
trated ﬂavonoids from propolis tincture using SC-CO2 anti-solvent
[21]. Lee et al. extracted DHCA fromBrazilian propolis using SC-CO2
that was modiﬁed with co-solvent, followed by column chro-
matography to obtain highly pure DHCA [12]. Chen et al. using a
SC-CO2 extract containing41.2% (wt)DHCAsuccessfully suppressed
growths of human colo-205 cancer cells, however, total yield of
the SC-CO2 extract was relatively low compared with Soxhlet ethyl
acetate extract [30].
Supercritical anti-solvent precipitation of solutes from liquid-
phase solution has been extensively applied in pigment dispersion
and pharmaceutical recrystallization to produce ﬁne particles with
high yield [22,23]. This approach has been also utilized in the sepa-
ration of bioactive compounds from natural materials, including
ﬂavonoids, -carotene, ginkgolides and lycopene [21–26]. Addi-
tionally, experimental data on the phase equilibrium between
SC-CO2 and organic solvent are important to understand the super-
critical anti-solvent (SAS) process, as supercritical, superheated,
liquid and co-existing phases directly inﬂuence the morphology,

(16). Temperatures in the system were monitored using several K-
type thermocouples (14-1–14-5) and pressures in the system were
monitored by several Bourdon-type pressure gauges (2-1–2-6).
The batch SC-CO2 anti-solvent process was started by pump-
ing the ethyl acetate solution into the precipitator after the CO2
had pressurized the vessel. The continuous processwas initiated by
continuously feeding the solution and the CO2 ﬂow simultaneously
through a coaxial nozzle into the precipitator after the pressures in
the precipitator and separator reached.
2.3. Analysis of precipitates
After each anti-solvent precipitation, a drying process using a
CO2 ﬂow at the operating pressure was carried out to remove the
solvent residue, then, the precipitatorwas open, the precipitatewas
collected, and the particulatewas suspended in de-ionizedwater to
form a sample. The mean particle size and particle size distribution
were determined using a light scattering particle size analyzer (BI-
90, Brookhaven Instruments Inc., USA). To determine the particle
morphology, the dried particulate was preliminarily coated with a
platinum ﬁlm by vacuum sputter, and then analyzed under a ﬁeld
emission scanning electronmicroscope (FE-SEM) (JSM-7401F, JEOL,
Japan). The weight of the precipitates was calculated as the differ-
ence between theweight of solids in the fed and theweight of solids
contained in the liquid eluent that was collected in the ﬂask sepa-
rator. The total yield (TY), the recovery (Ri) and the enhancement
factor of ﬂavonoids and DHCA (ˇi) were then calculated from the
following equations:
TY = weight of precipitate

weight of i in precipitate
weight of i in feed material
× 100%; recovery (2)
ˇi =

2.4. Quantiﬁcation of DHCA and ﬂavonoids
A Waters HPLC system (USA), which comprising a 600E multi-
solvent delivery pump, a 717 plus auto-sampler, a 486 UV/vis
detector and Millennium 2010 system manager software, was
adopted to analyze the SC-CO2 precipitates. The samples had been
ﬁltered through a 0.45mPVDFmembrane (Millipore, USA) before
the analysis, and then a 20L samplewas injected into a C8 column
(4.6mm×250mm, 5U, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and a C18 col-
umn (4.6mm×250mm, 5U, Hichrom, UK)-reversed phase column
at a ﬂow rate of 1mL/min to partition the ﬂavonoids and DHCA,
respectively.
The mobile phase that was used to analyze ﬂavonoids consisted
of 0.1% phosphoric acid (A) and methanol (B). The gradient was ini-
tially set to 65% A; reduced linearly to 50% A within 15 min; held
at 50% A for 20min, and ﬁnally reduced to 35% A within 15min.
The correlation coefﬁcient (R2) exceeded 0.996 for each linear cal-
ibration curve from 10 to 400g/g for ﬂavonoids, and the limit of
detection was in the range of 90–150ng/g. The HPLC analysis of
seven ﬂavonoids was reported by Chen et al. [31]. The mobile phase
thatwas utilized to analyze DHCA comprised 55%methanol (A) and
80%methanol (B), bothofwhich contained0.5% acetic acid. The gra-
dient was initially set to 100% A for 55 min; reduced linearly to 40%
A from 56 to 85min, held at 40% A for 10min, and ﬁnally increased
to 100% A from 96 to 120min. The R2 of the linear calibration curve
exceeded 0.99 from50 to 800g/g for DHCA, and the limit of detec-
tion was 4300ng/g. The temperature of the column was controlled
at 308K, and the detection wavelength was set to 280nm for both
analyses.
2.5. Growth inhibition of human colon cancer cells
Human colon cancer cells (colo-205, CCL-222) were cultivated
in the RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL, USA), to which was added
10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cultured media were supplemented
with 100units/mL penicillin, 100g/mL streptomycin, 2mM l-
glutamine (Gibco BRL, USA) and all of the cells were incubated
in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 310K. Before treat-
ment, the media containing cells were collected, re-suspended and
stained with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma,
USA). The cellswere counted using a hemocytometer (0.0025mm2,
Marienfeld, Germany) under a phase contrast-inverted micro-
scope (Axiovert 25, Zeiss, Germany). 5×103 Cells were individually
seeded in each well of a 96-well dish, and dosed with a diluted
DMSO solution of Soxhlet solvent extracts and SC-CO2 precipi-
tates, while the blank solution, with the same DMSO concentration
(<0.1%) was dosed and used as a control. Following 24, 48 and 72h
of cells incubation, 20L of yellow MTT reagent (Sigma, USA) was
added into each cell-well to react with the mitochondrial dehydro-
genase enzyme of living cells for 3h at 310K. A solution of sodium
dodecyl sulfate in 0.01M HCl was then added to dissolve the insol-
uble purple formazan crystals, and the intensity of the color at
570nm of each well was measured using an ELISA reader (Anthos
2001, Austria). The cell viability was quantiﬁed as the ratio of OD570
of the dosed sample to that of the control sample. The EC50 values of
the cytotoxic assay for each treated sample were regressed using a
linear calibration curve (R2 =0.99). The data presented correspond
to mean values of results from triplicate experiments.

the RSM response parameters, including total yield, concentration
and recovery, of DHCA and ﬂavonoids as well as mean particle size
were analyzed using an ANOVA table in the Design-Expert soft-
ware package with a quadratic regression model. The variation in
the 3D plots of RSM response surfaces with independent factors is
investigated below.
Fig. 2(a) demonstrates that the total yield at CO2 ﬂow rate
of 10.8 g/min markedly exceeded that at 32.6 g/min because the
expansion process provided a sufﬁcient contact time between the
CO2 and the solution for precipitation. Experimental data also show
that the CO2 expansion volume slightly inﬂuenced the total yield
when the volume exceeded 50L. On the other side, both factors
substantially affected the concentration of DHCA, as presented in
Fig. 2(b), suggesting that the concentration of DHCA decreased
as the amount and ﬂow rate of CO2 increased. Fig. 3(a) plots the
obvious effect of these two factors on the recovery of DHCA. The
fact of the 3D shape of the DHCA recovery surface was similar to
that of the DHCA concentration surface indicates that the DHCA
precipitation increased with the total amount of precipitate. In
contrast, Fig. 3(b) displays the drop in the mean particle size of
the precipitate as the CO2 ﬂow rate and CO2 expansion volume
increases, revealing that a high ﬂow rate and large expansion vol-
ume cause the anti-solvent to expand fast and continuously with
an increase in CO2 ﬂow rate given a ﬁxed amount of the feed
solution.
3.3. Morphology and particle size distribution of the particulate
Fig. 4 plots the particle size distribution (PSD) of particles that
were generated by continuous SC-CO2 precipitations at 20MPa,
328K with a CO2 volume of 100 L. A narrower PSD pattern corre-
sponds to a higher CO2 ﬂow rate. The smallest mean particle size
of the precipitate was 4.02m (datum # 6 in Table 3). Fig. 5(a)–(c)
depicts the sphere-shape morphology of the precipitates for 10.8,
21.7, 32.6 g/min, respectively, imaged at 1000× by a ﬁeld-emission
scanning electron microscope, indicating that the higher CO2 ﬂow
rate gives a clearer growth boundary between the particles. Fig. 5(c)
displays the smallest mean size of the particulates generated by a
SC-CO2 precipitation of 3.95m at 20MPa, 328K, a CO2 volume of
150 L and a CO2 ﬂow rate of 32.6 g/min of datum#9 in Table 3. Fig. 6
shows a magniﬁed microphotograph of the 32.6 g/min particulates
imaged at 5000 times.
3.4. Cytotoxicity assay of the precipitates
A few experimental bioassays of growth inhibition on human
colon cancer cells that were treated by SC-CO2 precipitates were
conducted herein. Table 4 presents the effective concentration for
50% inhibition (EC50) of colo-205 cells treated with samples after
72h. The experimental results show that the cytotoxicity of the
ethanol Soxhlet extract toward colo-205 cells was close to that
of the Soxhlet ethyl acetate extract. However, the EC50 value of

This study elucidates supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) anti-solvent precipitation of 3, 5-diprenyl-
4-hydroxycinnamic acid (DHCA) from the ethyl acetate solution of ultra-green Brazilian propolis. The
SC-CO2 anti-solvent process at 20MPa and 328K generated the precipitates containing DHCA (306mg/g)
more than that of the Soxhlet ethyl acetate extract (204mg/g). A two factorial central composite response
surface methodology was adopted to examine the effects of CO2 ﬂow rate and CO2 expansion volume
on mean particle size of the precipitate. Analysis of the DHCA recovered indicated that both factors are
signiﬁcant. The mean particle size fell as the CO2 ﬂow rate or the CO2 volume increased. Finally, the dose-
dependent concentrations from 25 to 400g/mL demonstrated that aqueous samples of the precipitated
SC-CO2 particulates effectively inhibited the growth of human colon (colo-205) cancer cells.

1. Introduction
Propolis is a resinous product collected from bee hives and
gathered by honey bees from various plant exudates. This prod-
uct is composed of 45% resins, 30% waxes and fatty acids, 10%
essential oils, 5% pollens and 10% organic compounds and minerals
[1]. Propolis has been utilized in folk medicine for several years,
especially in Europe and Japan, because of its various therapeu-
tic activities, including antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inﬂammatory,
antioxidant, immunomodulatory, free radical scavenging, and hep-
atoprotective [2–6].
A few bioactive compounds in propolis are ﬂavonoids and
phenolic acids as well as derivatives, which include two major
anti-cancer materials—caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and
3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (DHCA). Numerous recent
studieshave reportedon thebiological properties of theDHCAcom-
pound, especially those associated with the inhibition of growth
of cancer cells, such as human leukemia and colon cells [7–11].
DHCA exhibits an anti-oxidative activity toward normal cells and
an excellent inhibitory effect on growth of grams-positive bacte-
ria such as Staphylococcus aureus [12–15]. Bohlmann and Jakupovic
were the ﬁrst to identify the DHCA compound, which exclusively

exists in Brazilian propolis [16,17]. In recent year, various super-
green approaches that are based on the use of supercritical ﬂuids
have been applied on propolis to yield high valuable products. Stahl
et al. ﬁrst removed wax using SC-CO2 extraction to enhance the
concentration of ﬂavonoids in the extract [18]. You et al. increased
the amount of ﬂavonoids inwater-soluble propolis by using SC-CO2
extraction [19]. Wang et al. obtained the antioxidant components
frompropolis by SC-CO2 fractionation [20]. Catchpole et al. concen-
trated ﬂavonoids from propolis tincture using SC-CO2 anti-solvent
[21]. Lee et al. extracted DHCA fromBrazilian propolis using SC-CO2
that was modiﬁed with co-solvent, followed by column chro-
matography to obtain highly pure DHCA [12]. Chen et al. using a
SC-CO2 extract containing41.2% (wt)DHCAsuccessfully suppressed
growths of human colo-205 cancer cells, however, total yield of
the SC-CO2 extract was relatively low compared with Soxhlet ethyl
acetate extract [30].
Supercritical anti-solvent precipitation of solutes from liquid-
phase solution has been extensively applied in pigment dispersion
and pharmaceutical recrystallization to produce ﬁne particles with
high yield [22,23]. This approach has been also utilized in the sepa-
ration of bioactive compounds from natural materials, including
ﬂavonoids, -carotene, ginkgolides and lycopene [21–26]. Addi-
tionally, experimental data on the phase equilibrium between
SC-CO2 and organic solvent are important to understand the super-
critical anti-solvent (SAS) process, as supercritical, superheated,
liquid and co-existing phases directly inﬂuence the morphology,

(16). Temperatures in the system were monitored using several K-
type thermocouples (14-1–14-5) and pressures in the system were
monitored by several Bourdon-type pressure gauges (2-1–2-6).
The batch SC-CO2 anti-solvent process was started by pump-
ing the ethyl acetate solution into the precipitator after the CO2
had pressurized the vessel. The continuous processwas initiated by
continuously feeding the solution and the CO2 ﬂow simultaneously
through a coaxial nozzle into the precipitator after the pressures in
the precipitator and separator reached.
2.3. Analysis of precipitates
After each anti-solvent precipitation, a drying process using a
CO2 ﬂow at the operating pressure was carried out to remove the
solvent residue, then, the precipitatorwas open, the precipitatewas
collected, and the particulatewas suspended in de-ionizedwater to
form a sample. The mean particle size and particle size distribution
were determined using a light scattering particle size analyzer (BI-
90, Brookhaven Instruments Inc., USA). To determine the particle
morphology, the dried particulate was preliminarily coated with a
platinum ﬁlm by vacuum sputter, and then analyzed under a ﬁeld
emission scanning electronmicroscope (FE-SEM) (JSM-7401F, JEOL,
Japan). The weight of the precipitates was calculated as the differ-
ence between theweight of solids in the fed and theweight of solids
contained in the liquid eluent that was collected in the ﬂask sepa-
rator. The total yield (TY), the recovery (Ri) and the enhancement
factor of ﬂavonoids and DHCA (ˇi) were then calculated from the
following equations:
TY = weight of precipitate
weight of feed material
× 100% ; total yield (1)
Ri =
weight of i in precipitate
weight of i in feed material
× 100%; recovery (2)
ˇi =
concentration of i in precipitate
concentration of i in Soxhlet extract
;

2.4. Quantiﬁcation of DHCA and ﬂavonoids
A Waters HPLC system (USA), which comprising a 600E multi-
solvent delivery pump, a 717 plus auto-sampler, a 486 UV/vis
detector and Millennium 2010 system manager software, was
adopted to analyze the SC-CO2 precipitates. The samples had been
ﬁltered through a 0.45mPVDFmembrane (Millipore, USA) before
the analysis, and then a 20L samplewas injected into a C8 column
(4.6mm×250mm, 5U, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and a C18 col-
umn (4.6mm×250mm, 5U, Hichrom, UK)-reversed phase column
at a ﬂow rate of 1mL/min to partition the ﬂavonoids and DHCA,
respectively.
The mobile phase that was used to analyze ﬂavonoids consisted
of 0.1% phosphoric acid (A) and methanol (B). The gradient was ini-
tially set to 65% A; reduced linearly to 50% A within 15 min; held
at 50% A for 20min, and ﬁnally reduced to 35% A within 15min.
The correlation coefﬁcient (R2) exceeded 0.996 for each linear cal-
ibration curve from 10 to 400g/g for ﬂavonoids, and the limit of
detection was in the range of 90–150ng/g. The HPLC analysis of
seven ﬂavonoids was reported by Chen et al. [31]. The mobile phase
thatwas utilized to analyze DHCA comprised 55%methanol (A) and
80%methanol (B), bothofwhich contained0.5% acetic acid. The gra-
dient was initially set to 100% A for 55 min; reduced linearly to 40%
A from 56 to 85min, held at 40% A for 10min, and ﬁnally increased
to 100% A from 96 to 120min. The R2 of the linear calibration curve
exceeded 0.99 from50 to 800g/g for DHCA, and the limit of detec-
tion was 4300ng/g. The temperature of the column was controlled
at 308K, and the detection wavelength was set to 280nm for both
analyses.
2.5. Growth inhibition of human colon cancer cells
Human colon cancer cells (colo-205, CCL-222) were cultivated
in the RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL, USA), to which was added
10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cultured media were supplemented
with 100units/mL penicillin, 100g/mL streptomycin, 2mM l-
glutamine (Gibco BRL, USA) and all of the cells were incubated
in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 310K. Before treat-
ment, the media containing cells were collected, re-suspended and
stained with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma,
USA). The cellswere counted using a hemocytometer (0.0025mm2,
Marienfeld, Germany) under a phase contrast-inverted micro-
scope (Axiovert 25, Zeiss, Germany). 5×103 Cells were individually
seeded in each well of a 96-well dish, and dosed with a diluted
DMSO solution of Soxhlet solvent extracts and SC-CO2 precipi-
tates, while the blank solution, with the same DMSO concentration
(<0.1%) was dosed and used as a control. Following 24, 48 and 72h
of cells incubation, 20L of yellow MTT reagent (Sigma, USA) was
added into each cell-well to react with the mitochondrial dehydro-
genase enzyme of living cells for 3h at 310K. A solution of sodium
dodecyl sulfate in 0.01M HCl was then added to dissolve the insol-
uble purple formazan crystals, and the intensity of the color at
570nm of each well was measured using an ELISA reader (Anthos
2001, Austria). The cell viability was quantiﬁed as the ratio of OD570
of the dosed sample to that of the control sample. The EC50 values of
the cytotoxic assay for each treated sample were regressed using a
linear calibration curve (R2 =0.99). The data presented correspond
to mean values of results from triplicate experiments.

the RSM response parameters, including total yield, concentration
and recovery, of DHCA and ﬂavonoids as well as mean particle size
were analyzed using an ANOVA table in the Design-Expert soft-
ware package with a quadratic regression model. The variation in
the 3D plots of RSM response surfaces with independent factors is
investigated below.
Fig. 2(a) demonstrates that the total yield at CO2 ﬂow rate
of 10.8 g/min markedly exceeded that at 32.6 g/min because the
expansion process provided a sufﬁcient contact time between the
CO2 and the solution for precipitation. Experimental data also show
that the CO2 expansion volume slightly inﬂuenced the total yield
when the volume exceeded 50L. On the other side, both factors
substantially affected the concentration of DHCA, as presented in
Fig. 2(b), suggesting that the concentration of DHCA decreased
as the amount and ﬂow rate of CO2 increased. Fig. 3(a) plots the
obvious effect of these two factors on the recovery of DHCA. The
fact of the 3D shape of the DHCA recovery surface was similar to
that of the DHCA concentration surface indicates that the DHCA
precipitation increased with the total amount of precipitate. In
contrast, Fig. 3(b) displays the drop in the mean particle size of
the precipitate as the CO2 ﬂow rate and CO2 expansion volume
increases, revealing that a high ﬂow rate and large expansion vol-
ume cause the anti-solvent to expand fast and continuously with
an increase in CO2 ﬂow rate given a ﬁxed amount of the feed
solution.
3.3. Morphology and particle size distribution of the particulate
Fig. 4 plots the particle size distribution (PSD) of particles that
were generated by continuous SC-CO2 precipitations at 20MPa,
328K with a CO2 volume of 100 L. A narrower PSD pattern corre-
sponds to a higher CO2 ﬂow rate. The smallest mean particle size
of the precipitate was 4.02m (datum # 6 in Table 3). Fig. 5(a)–(c)
depicts the sphere-shape morphology of the precipitates for 10.8,
21.7, 32.6 g/min, respectively, imaged at 1000× by a ﬁeld-emission
scanning electron microscope, indicating that the higher CO2 ﬂow
rate gives a clearer growth boundary between the particles. Fig. 5(c)
displays the smallest mean size of the particulates generated by a
SC-CO2 precipitation of 3.95m at 20MPa, 328K, a CO2 volume of
150 L and a CO2 ﬂow rate of 32.6 g/min of datum#9 in Table 3. Fig. 6
shows a magniﬁed microphotograph of the 32.6 g/min particulates
imaged at 5000 times.
3.4. Cytotoxicity assay of the precipitates
A few experimental bioassays of growth inhibition on human
colon cancer cells that were treated by SC-CO2 precipitates were
conducted herein. Table 4 presents the effective concentration for
50% inhibition (EC50) of colo-205 cells treated with samples after
72h. The experimental results show that the cytotoxicity of the
ethanol Soxhlet extract toward colo-205 cells was close to that
of the Soxhlet ethyl acetate extract. However, the EC50 value of
