where Un and Pn are the complex amplitude 
of the displacement and the stress at the 
intersection of cell n and n+1, respectively. 
a1 and a2 can be calculated by the structure of 
cell. It is noted that a1 and a2 are dependent 
on the local coordinate for each cell, x , but 
independent on the cell number n. Based on 
wave equation, the relations between the 
displacement and stress at the ends of cell n  
can be expressed by[7] 
 
nnn BPAUU += −1     (2a) 
 
nnn APCUP += −− 11     (2b) 
 
Expressions (2a) and (2b) are illustrated by a 
new TWSF graph model as shown in Fig. 2. 
Based on the graph model for a single plate 
segment, a graph model to describe the 
generalized coordinate for all of the plate 
may be constructed. Figure 2 shows that Un 
and Pn for n=1, 2, ⋅⋅⋅, N, are dependent on two 
input variables U0 and PN . We can express 
Un and Pn as a function of both input 
variables

Using some mathematical operations, the 
functions given in Eqs. (3a) to (3b) are 
reduced to

 As the right end of the plate is free, 
the stress of the plate at the right end is zero, 
0=NP . The responses of the plate at each 
intersection of cells Un and Pn relative to a 
unity the driving displacement can be 
determined by Eq. (3). Hence

Wave motion of the plate relative to the 
driving displacement are determined by (1), 
in which Un-1 and Pn are replaced by the 
results given in Eq. (5a) with substitution of 
n-1 for n and (5b), respectively, as

respectively. We see that both Ω and ϕw are 
dependent on the local coordinate x  but all 
Ω, ϕD and ϕw are independent on the cell 
number n. 
 If the right end of the plate is fixed, 
the displacement at the right end of the plate 
is zero, UN=0. From Eq. (3) we find that PN 
should be only dependent on U0 . For the 
excitation of a unity displacement, we have
