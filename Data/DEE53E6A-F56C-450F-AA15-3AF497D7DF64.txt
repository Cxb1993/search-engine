一、英文摘要 
This is the final report of the 3-year project. The objective of the first year is to improve the 
low temperature deposited nanoscale AlN dielectric films for OTFTs. The objective of the second 
year is to investigate the interfacial properties between dielectric films and pentacene organic 
transportation layer. The objective of the third year is to search new dielectric materials for OTFTs 
and to evaluate their OTFT related applications. The primary research results of the project are (1) 
to find out the effects of carbon aging and methance exposure on the device performance of 
pentacene OTFTs with AlN as the gate dielectric, (2) to find out the effect of infrared exposure on 
the structure quality of pentacene and the device performance of OTFTs and (3) to find new low 
temperature gate dielectrics (HfON, bensimidazole-copper complex, and silk fibroin) as the gate 
dielectrics for OTFTs.

二、計劃緣由及文獻探討 
在軟性電子以及可撓式面板等前瞻技術的推動下，近年來有機薄膜電晶體(OTFT)的相
關研究已成為「有機薄膜元件」的研究主流之一【1-3】，而有機薄膜電晶體(OTFT)是否可
以成功被應用於低成本大面積、或可攜式、可拋式的產品中，有兩項重點：〈一〉提升有機
薄膜電晶體電性傳輸特性，包含改善有機/閘極介電層、提高有機薄膜載子遷移率、以及降低
電晶體操作電壓。〈二〉提升有機薄膜可靠度，包含提升元件抗水氧的穩定度、以及長期偏
壓操作下的電性穩定度。 
有機薄膜電晶體的最主要的缺點在於有機薄膜層的載子遷移率（carrier mobility）偏低，
在 1980年代末期，有機薄膜層的最佳載子遷移率記錄只有~10-5 cm2/Vs，當改用 Regioregular 
polythiophene 當作有機薄膜層後，載子遷移率提升至~0.1 cm2/Vs，近年來已發現若改用短的
有機分子，例如並五苯（pentacene），當作有機薄膜層，載子遷移率提升至 ~3 cm2/Vs，但
這記錄只有在有方向性排列時才會發生。【4】雖然有機薄膜層的最佳載子遷移率比單晶矽的
載子遷移率的 1000 cm2/Vs，要差 300 多倍，但並五苯有機薄膜層的載子遷移率比非晶形矽
（amorphous Si; a-Si）的0.1-1 cm2/Vs來得好，此結果點燃有機薄膜電晶體(OTFT)的研發腳步，
尤其是「有機薄膜電晶體(OTFT)」有製程簡單、重量輕以及成本低等優點，【3】使得有機
薄膜元件在產業的競爭力大大增加。

因材料特性不同，製備介電層薄膜的方法不同。其中氮化鋁、HfON 兩種介電層，必須以射
頻反應式磁控濺鍍系統製備介電層薄膜，benzimidazole-copper complex、蠶絲蛋白可以旋轉塗

件特性。（1）以紅外線改進材料界面結構，提升元件特性。（3）開發新的低溫介電薄膜，

deposition rate was 0.5 Å/s as monitored by a quartz crystal
oscillator. Finally, 100 nm thick Au pads were deposited
through a shadow mask to function as the source and drain
contacts. The device channel width and length were defined
as 1000 and 400 m.
B. Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS model ESCA
PHI1600 was used to analyze the surface composition and
chemical bonding states of a material using a monochro-
mated Mg K line at 1253.6 eV. The instrument base pres-
sure was 510−9 torr. The C 1s at 284.5 eV was used as a
reference for all detected peak positions. To separate chemi-
cal bonding states in the XPS spectra, the spectral line shape
was simulated using a suitable combination of Gaussian and
Lorentzian functions.
This study used contact angle measurements to deter-
mine the migration of hydrophobic and hydrophilic func-
tional groups. The water contact angle was sensitive to the
chemical composition of the film surface.13 The contact
angles in this study were obtained by the KRŰSS contact
angle system for universal surface testing model GH-100.
Material surface energy was then derived using three stan-
dard liquid contact angles DI water, diiodo-methane, and
ethylene glycol. The surface energy was calculated using
Fowkes and Young’s approximation, as in Eq. 1 Eq.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Device characteristics
Pentacene-based OTFTs were fabricated on AlN dielec-
tric surfaces that were aged in a dry box for various periods
of time. Differences in aging time revealed the effect of car-
bon attachment on the performance of AlN dielectric OTFTs.
All electrical characteristics of OTFTs were measured using
Agilent 4156 and Agilent 4284 analyzers. Figure 1a com-
pares the transfer characteristics of OTFTs fabricated on an
as-deposited AlN surface and on an AlN surface that was
aged with carbon attached in a dry box for 14 days. Table I
lists the typical parameters of OTFTs extracted from the data
in Fig. 1a, including mobility, threshold voltage, Ion / Ioff
current ratio, subthreshold swing, and interface state density
NS.S.. The mobility and threshold voltage values are ex-
tracted by the slope and intercept of the square root of drain
current ID versus gate voltage VG curves in Fig. 1a,
respectively. The interface state density was extracted using
Eq. 2, as proposed in Ref. 17,
NS.S. = S logekT/q − 1Ciq , 2
where q is the electron charge, S is the subthreshold swing, T
is the temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and Ci is the
insulator capacitance per unit area.

faces. The enhanced carbon attachment on the AlN surface
makes the surface hydrophobic and lowers the surface en-
ergy.
The carbon required for carbon attachment to occur
probably comes from the atmosphere during sample transfer
or from the surface of the dry box at room temperature.
However, the following argument shows that carbon in the
atmosphere is most likely not the possible source of contami-
nation. The AlN surface energy maintains the same value if
the as-deposited AlN is removed from the deposited chamber
and then put into a vacuum bag for 30 days at less than 1 atm
using a vacuum sealing system FoodSaver Co., model
VAC550. This means that the short air exposure time before
putting the AlN samples into the vacuum bag would not
affect the AlN surface energy. In other words, the change in
AlN surface energy is due to carbon desorption from the
surface of the dry box at room temperature for a long stay
time.
The signals of oxidized carbon components, C–O and
O–C=O, decrease when carbon attaches to the AlN surface.
This result agrees with the reduction in polar component
surface energy at longer aging times in Fig. 3b. This reduc-
tion in surface energy is thus attributed to carbon attachment
that may enhance C=C bonds and reduce the relative amount
of C–O and O–C=O bonds on the aged AlN surface. Carbon
attachment reduces polar functional groups and surface en-
ergy to match the pentacene surface energy. Similar to the
dielectric surface treated with a self-assembled monolayer
SAM before pentacene growth, the organic SAM material
increases the C=C signal on the dielectric surface and en-
hances the performance of pentacene-based OTFTs.16,21,22
D. Pentacene morphology
The reduction in surface energy plays an important role
in affecting pentacene growth and morphology. Figures
5a–5d present atomic force microscope AFM images of
pentacene deposited on an AlN surface. These AFM images
were measured using an AFM Dimension 3100, Digital In-
strument in tapping mode. Surface roughness and surface
energy affect pentacene growth. Previous research shows
that surface roughness has an effect on pentacene
growth.23,24 The AlN surface roughness remains about the
same after aging for 14 days. The surface roughnesses of all
AlN surfaces remain at 0.240.02 nm. Therefore, penta-
cene growth is not affected by surface roughness in this
study. Figures 5a and 5b show the morphologies of pen-
tacene islands on the as-deposited AlN surface and the 14
day aged AlN surface in the initial deposition stage. The
AFM images above demonstrate that a fixed amount of pen-
tacene deposited on the aged AlN surface creates larger is-
lands and covers a larger area than the same amount of pen-
tacene deposited on the as-depositing AlN surface. The fixed
amount of pentacene was controlled using the same deposi-
tion rate and deposition time in the same run. Pentacene
covers approximately 29% of the as-deposited AlN surface
and 53% of the 14 day aged AlN surface. The larger island
size and area coverage on the aged AlN surface are strongly
correlated with a lower AlN surface energy due to carbon
attachment. The C=C bonds on the aged AlN surface seem

The device performance of a pentacene-based organic thin-film transistor OTFT fabricated on an aluminum nitride AlN surface
can be improved by exposing AlN to a methane CH4 gas before device fabrication. The mobility of the OTFT was enhanced
from 0.046 to 0.924 cm2/V s by exposing AlN to CH4. Its threshold voltage was reduced from 4.5 to 1.9 V. After the CH4
exposure, the reduced surface energy of AlN was correlated with the improvement of the OTFT performance. The reduction of
surface energy was correlated with the replacement of O–CvO bonds by C–O bonds and hydrocarbon CHx on the AlN surface.

Organic thin-film transistors OTFTs are currently the focus of
considerable research for electronic applications requiring full com-
patibility with flexible substrates, low temperature processing, low
cost manufacturing, and large area coverage.1-3 The high threshold
voltage of organic transistors is usually a limitation in terms of
electronic applications. Aluminum nitride AlN is a good candidate
as a high-k dielectric because it exhibits a high chemical and physi-
cal stability, high breakdown voltage, low leakage current, and high
dielectric permittivity3,4 AlN was illustrated to be an appropriate
gate dielectric in pentacene-based OTFTs to lower the threshold
voltage to less than 5 V.3,5 For flexible pentacene-based OTFT ap-
plications, the AlN dielectric can be fabricated at a low temperature
150°C using a radio-frequency rf sputtering system. In our
previous work,6 high performance OTFTs were achieved when OT-
FTs were fabricated on the hydrophobic AlN surface. The as-
deposited AlN film is hydrophilic because of polar bonding of Al–N
bonds on the surface. Carbon attachment occurs on the as-deposited
AlN after storage in a dry box for a period of time, which transforms
the AlN surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. A low surface
energy and high water contact angle after carbon attachment on the
surface were reported.5,7 Pentacene-based OTFTs deposited on the
surfaces of gate dielectrics with low surface energy were reported to
exhibit a better device performance.8,9 The AlN dielectric after car-
bon attachment exhibits a surface energy of 51 mJ/m2, similar to
that of pentacene.3,5 This supports the fact that the attachment of
carbon to the AlN gate dielectric surface improves the performance
of OTFT devices.5 To obtain an optimum device performance, the
carbon attachment on the AlN gate dielectric, however, takes a very
long time 2 weeks before the fabrication of pentacene-based
OTFTs. The time for carbon attachment can probably be shortened
by exposing the AlN dielectric to a carbon-containing gas such as
methane CH4.
In this article, we present the effect of CH4 exposure on the AlN
gate dielectric in pentacene-based OTFTs. Carbon attachment on the
AlN gate dielectric surface can be enhanced by CH4 exposure within
15 min, which is much faster than that in air exposure. The carbon
attachment through the exposure of methane is a method to reduce
the surface energy of AlN. A good quality of pentacene can be
formed on the methane-exposed AlN. The device characteristics of
pentacene-based OTFTs with CH4-treated AlN gate dielectric exhib-
its a better performance.
Experimental
Heavily doped n-type silicon 100 wafers with a doping concen-
tration of 5  1015 cm−3 were used as substrates. A 1200 Å AlN
film was deposited onto the as-cleaned silicon wafers at a low tem-
perature 150°C substrate temperature in an rf-sputtering
system.3,5,10 Mass flow controllers were used to monitor mixed ar-
gon and nitrogen gas at an Ar/N2 ratio of 2/9. The total pressure for
AlN film deposition was 2.5 mTorr. All relevant experimental details
were published elsewhere.3,5,10 After AlN film deposition, the as-
deposited samples were exposed to the methane CH4 gas in a
vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 3.5  10−2 Torr. The expo-
sure of AlN/Si100 substrate to CH4 was operated at a total pressure
of 7  10−1 Torr and at a flow rate of 100 sccm. The AlN/Si100
substrate was heated to 150°C during CH4 exposure.
A rectangular piece of pentacene Aldrich Chemistry, not puri-
fied defined by a shadow mask was deposited onto the AlN surface.
The AlN/Si100 substrate was heated to 70°C during pentacene
deposition at a pressure of 3  10−6 Torr. The pentacene film was
1000 Å thick, and the deposition rate was 0.5 Å/s monitored by a
quartz crystal oscillator. X-ray diffraction XRD was used to deter-
mine the crystalline phase of pentacene on the CH4-treated AlN film.
Finally, 100 nm thick Au pads were deposited through a shadow
mask to function as the source and drain contacts. The device di-
mension was patterned with a channel length L of 500 m and a
channel width W of 1000 m.
Results and Discussion
Device characteristics.— Pentacene-based OTFTs were fabri-
cated on AlN dielectric surfaces that were exposed to CH4 gas be-
fore device fabrication. All electrical characteristics of OTFTs were
measured using Agilent 4156 and Agilent 4284 analyzers. Figure 1a
compares the transfer characteristics ID-VG of OTFTs fabricated
on the as-deposited AlN surface and on the CH4-exposed AlN sur-
face. Table I lists the typical parameters of OTFTs extracted from
the data in Fig. 1a, including mobility, threshold voltage, Ion/Ioff
current ratio, and subthreshold swing. The mobility and threshold
voltage values are extracted by the slope and the intercept of the
square root of the drain current ID vs the gate voltage VG curves
in Fig. 1a, respectively. OTFTs fabricated on the CH4-exposed AlN
surface exhibit a low threshold voltage and high field-effect mobility
FE in the saturation region. OTFTs fabricated on the
CH4-exposed AlN surface exhibit the highest value of field-effect
mobility 0.924 cm2/V s. However, the subthreshold swings of
the OTFTs fabricated on the AlN films with and without CH4 expo-
sure are almost unchanged. The subthreshold swing is a measure-
ment of trap defect density, which is influenced by interface prop-
erties surface roughness, atomic defects, etc. and carrier mobility.
The mobility increases with the subthreshold swing unchanged, im-
plying that the interface properties dominate the transport mecha-
nism. The unchanged subthreshold swing is probably due to the
deep states that were not affected by the exposure of CH4.

trics providing a low energy surface close to that of pentacene.8,9
The hydrophobic surface low surface energy enables the pentacene
molecules to align vertically in favor of carrier hopping among the
-orbitals such that electrical characteristics can be improved.9
Contact angle measurements with deionized DI water, diiodo-
methane, and ethylene glycol were performed on the as-deposited
AlN and the CH4-exposed AlN surfaces. Surface energies were de-
rived using three standard liquid contact angles DI water, diiodo-
methane, and ethylene glycol. Surface energies were calculated us-
ing Fowkes and Young’s approximation.11,12 All relevant surface
energy details were analyzed elsewhere.5,13 The data on water con-
tact angles are used to illustrate the variation in surface energies at
different CH4 exposure times, as shown in Fig. 3. The water contact
angles are approximately 37.5° on the as-deposited AlN surface and
84.5° on the AlN surface exposed to CH4 for 15 min. The triangle
, the filled circle symbol , and the empty circle symbol  in
Fig. 3 show the variation in surface energy, the corresponding polar
components, and the disperse components, respectively. After ex-
posing CH4 for 15 min, the surface energy and its polar component
reduce quickly to the lowest value within 15 min and remain ap-
proximately at the lowest value for a longer time. In contrast, the
disperse component stays at a value of 35 mJ/m2 not influenced
by the CH4 exposure. This implies that the reduction in surface
energy is mainly contributed by surface bonds with polar characters
on the CH4-exposed AlN surfaces.
Surface bonds on CH4-treated AlN film.— To understand the
surface chemistry on the CH4-exposed AlN surfaces, X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy XPS, model ESCA PHI1600 was used to
characterize the surface bonding information. The C 1s at 284.5 eV
was used as the reference to calibrate the energy positions of all
detected peaks because the AlN film is insulating. Figure 4a and b
shows the XPS C 1s spectra from the as-deposited and 15 min
CH4-exposed AlN surfaces. The prominent C 1s peak at 284.5 eV
does not necessarily indicate CvC double bonds because most hy-
drocarbons CHx show up at approximately 284.5 eV. By compar-
ing the prominent C 1s peaks in Fig. 4a and b, the peak intensity
slightly increases when the as-deposited AlN surface is exposed to
CH4. In other words, the contribution of the prominent C 1s peak is
small when the as-deposited AlN surface is exposed to CH4. The
prominent C 1s peak in Fig. 4a is thus assigned as CvC bonds for
the as-deposited AlN surface without CH4 exposure. The shoulder
next to the prominent C 1s peak indicates the existence of other
C-containing bonds. Three carbon components CvC, C–O, and
O–CvO peaks are required to obtain a consistent fit for all the C
1s spectra. The curve-fit data using Gaussian–Lorentzian functions
indicate that the C 1s signal consists of a CvC peak at 284.5 eV, a
C–O peak at 286.7 eV, and an O–CvO peak at 288.5 eV.14-17 No
Al–C bonds at 281.5 eV were observed in the C 1s data.18 The
existence of CvC, C–O, and O–CvO bonds on the as-deposited
AlN surface indicates that carbon and oxygen strongly react with Al
on the AlN surface in air right after AlN deposition. The increase in

Ordering of pentacene in organic thin film transistors induced
by irradiation of infrared light
C. H. Wang, S. W. Chen, and J. Hwanga
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsin-Chu City, 30013
Taiwan, Republic of China
Received 15 June 2009; accepted 17 August 2009; published online 8 September 2009
The device performances of pentacene-based organic thin film transistors OTFTs were greatly
improved by irradiation of infrared light. The field effect mobility and maximum drain current
increase from 0.200.01 to 0.570.02 cm2 /V s and 1.1410−5 to 4.9110−5 A, respectively.
The 001 peak of the pentacene “thin film” phase increases in intensity by 4.5 times after infrared
irradiation at 50 W for 2 h. Two types of crystal orientations, i.e., “crystal I” 2=5.91° and “crystal
II” 2=5.84°, coexist in the pentacene. The improvement of the characteristics of OTFTs is
attributed to crystallization and crystal reorientation induced by infrared light. © 2009 American
Institute of Physics. doi:10.1063/1.3222979
Organic thin film transistors OTFTs are currently the
focus of research for flexible electronic applications, because
of low-temperature processing and low manufacturing cost.
Pentacene, a fused-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is
one of the promising materials for the active layers in OTFTs
since it exhibits field effect mobility higher than other or-
ganic materials.1–5 The field effect mobility strongly depends
on the crystal orientation and the molecular ordering of the
pentacene in the channel in OTFTs. The most efficient carrier
transport occurs in a crystal with the overlapped - orbitals
in parallel to the surface of gate dielectric. The ordering of
pentacene molecules favoring the overlapping of - orbit-
als has been extensively investigated in past years.6
The crystal orientation and the molecular ordering of
pentacene depend on the gate dielectric material used in OT-
FTs. Silicon dioxide SiO2 is the frequently used dielectric.
The microstructure of pentacene depends on the deposition
temperature. The pentacene film usually consists of polycrys-
talline crystallites, misoriented molecules, grain boundary,
and defects, especially deposited at room temperature.7,8
Thermal annealing is a common step to increase the ordering
of pentacene such that the device performances of pentacene-
based OTFTs can be improved.9–11 Kang et al.10 reported that
field effect mobility could improved from 0.19 to
0.49 cm2 /V s by thermal annealing at 90 °C for 2 h. Ther-
mal annealing was performed in situ right after the deposi-
tion of pentacene in ultrahigh vacuum. The 001 peak of
pentacene in the x-ray diffractometer XRD data increases
in intensity after thermal annealing at 60 °C for 60 min,
reported by Ye et al.9 The increase in 001 peak was attrib-
uted to the elimination of misoriented molecules and defects.
In other words, crystallization of misoriented molecules and
annihilation of defects occur during thermal annealing. There
exists a critical temperature at 60–90 °C beyond which
the ordering of pentacene degrades according to the reduc-
tion in the 001 peak in XRD spectra.9,10
In this article, we present another approach to increase
the ordering of pentacene by irradiation of infrared light. It is
a simple and low-cost process. The field effect mobility can
be improved by approximately three times after irradiation of
infrared light for 90 min. The improvement of the character-
istics of OTFTs is attributed to the ordering of pentacene
resulting from crystallization and crystal reorientation of
pentacene.
Prior to the fabrication of pentacene-based OTFTs, pen-
tacene was deposited onto the SiO2 /Si100 surface and then
irradiated by a midinfrared tube of 2500–25000 nm in wave-
length at 50 W for various irradiation time in the vacuum of
5 mTorr. The effect of infrared irradiation on the device per-
formances of pentacene-based OTFTs is presented. Figure
1a shows the output characteristics of the pentacene-based
OTFTs and the 90 min infrared irradiated pentacene-based
OTFTs. All the OTFTs with/without infrared irradiation ex-
hibit standard output characteristics of transistors. The maxi-
mum drain current increases with infrared irradiation time
from 1.1410−5 A no infrared irradiation to 4.91
10−5 A 90 min infrared irradiation. This suggests that
the resistance of pentacene in the channel is reduced after
infrared irradiation. Figure 1b shows the square root of
drain current ID versus gate voltage VG curves, from
which field effect mobility FE and threshold voltage are
extracted by the slope and by the intercept, respectively. The

crystal I to crystal II is achieved after 180 min infrared irra-
diation. The increase amount of crystal II is, however, much
larger than that of crystal I. This supports that some amount
of crystal II results from the recrystallization of misoriented
pentacene molecules. The pentacene crystal reorientation and
the crystallization of misoriented pentacene occur concur-
rently during infrared irradiation, which is deduced from the
XRD data. This agrees very well with the enhancement in
device performance of OTFTs shown in Figs. 1 and 2 since a
larger grain of pentacene exhibit higher field effect mobility
and higher maximum drain current.
The crystallization of misoriented pentacene and the
pentacene crystal reorientation would results in the ordering
of pentacene that is activated by the irradiation of infrared
light. The ordering of pentacene is assisted by the molecular
vibration excited by the absorption of infrared light. Szc-
zepanski et al.16 reported that different vibration modes
could be generated in pentacene in the measurement of Fou-
rier transform infrared spectroscopy. Stretching and bending
modes of the CH bonds in pentacene appear at
3039–3089 cm−1 and 902 cm−1, respectively.17
The schematic diagrams showing the crystallization of
misoriented pentacene and the crystal reorientation of penta-
cene at different infrared annealing time are illustrated in
Figs. 5a–5c. The deposited pentacene consists of crystal I,
crystal II, and misoriented pentacene based on the XRD data
in Figs. 3 and 4. The infrared light may induce molecular
vibration of stretching and bending modes in pentacene as
plotted in the inset in Fig. 5b. The molecular vibration
helps pentacene molecules either “misoriented” or crystal I
to line up with the crystalline pentacene structure crystal II.
The alignment of pentacene molecules toward crystal II re-
sults in the grain size enlargement of crystal II. After infrared
irradiation for 3 h, the pentacene crystal reorientation, from
crystal I to crystal II, is completed according to the XRD
data in Fig. 4. However, the completion of crystallization of
misoriented pentacene is unknown since misoriented penta-
cene cannot be detected by XRD. Some residual misoriented
pentacene molecules probably exist at the grain boundaries
of crystal II after infrared irradiation.
The infrared irradiation treatment is very effective in the
enhancement in the device performance of OTFTs. The field
effect mobility increases from 0.21 to 0.59 cm2 /V s after 90
min infrared irradiation. The increase in field effect mobility
results from the grain size enlargement of pentacene in the
channel of an OTFT. The grain size enlargement is attributed
to both the crystallization of misoriented pentacene and the
crystal reorientation of pentacene. The treatment is a fast and
low-cost process, which simply irradiates infrared light onto
the device channels of pentacene-based OTFTs.

2. Experimental section
The HfON ﬁlms with and without a Hf-ﬂash metal layer
were chosen as the gate dielectrics for pentacene-based
OTFTs. Fig. 1 shows the schematic of a pentacene based
OTFT structure. The n+-Si(1 0 0) wafers were cleaned in
the deionized water, and then ultrasonically cleaned in
acetone. The n+-Si(1 0 0) wafers were dipped in a dilute
HF solution (HF:H2O = 1:100) in order to remove the native
oxide. HfON ﬁlms of about 50 nm thick were then depos-
ited on the as-dipped n+-Si(1 0 0) wafers at low-tempera-
ture (150 C) in a radio-frequency (RF) sputtering
chamber. The as-dipped n+-Si(1 0 0) wafers were ﬁrst
transferred to the RF sputtering chamber that was pumped
down to a base pressure to 2  106 torr. The chamber was
admitted with a mixing gas of Ar, O2, and N2. Mass ﬂow
controllers (MFCs) were used to monitor the ﬂow ratio of
the mixed gas. The working pressure was 0.25 mtorr. Be-
fore the HfON ﬁlm deposition, a Hf metal layer was ﬂashed
onto n+-Si(1 0 0) by RF sputtering. The Ar ﬂow rate was set
to 10 sccm and the RF gun power was operated at 100 W.
The bonding characteristics of the HfON ﬁlms were charac-
terized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS;
ESCA1600). With a shadow mask pattern, pentacene ﬁlms
were deposited onto the HfON gate dielectrics with or
without a Hf-ﬂash metal layer. The thickness of the penta-
cene ﬁlm was about 80 nm and the deposition rate was
0.5 Å/s, which was monitored by a quartz crystal oscillator.
The substrate temperature was heated to 50 C, and work
pressure was pumped to 1  106 torr. Finally, Au was
deposited as the source/drain electrodes. Au ﬁlm thickness
was 100 nm, and the shadow mask was used to deﬁne the
pad. The device channel width and length were deﬁned as
1000 and 100 lm. A metal–insulator–metal (MIM) struc-
ture (Al/HfON/Al) with same ﬁlm thickness of HfON
(30 nm) was fabricated to measure the gate leakage cur-
rent density and the dielectric constant. The area of the
Al pad was 1650  1000 lm2. All electrical characteristics
were measured using Agilent 4155c and Agilent 4284
analyzers.
3. Results and discussion
Surface roughness and leakage current density (Jleak) are
critical in the fabrication of an excellent gate dielectric for
OTFTs [6,12]. Polycrystalline HfO2 is not appropriate for
gate dielectric since it exhibits high surface roughness
and Jleak due to the existence of grain boundaries. Amor-
phous HfO2 (a-HfO2) ﬁlm is a better choice for gate dielec-
trics since it may exhibit low surface roughness and Jleak by
removing grain boundaries. In our work, three a-HfO2 re-
lated materials (a-HfO2, a-HfON, and a-HfON with a ﬂash
Hf metal layer) are compared and evaluated to be gate
dielectrics in terms of surface roughness and Jleak. The eval-
uation results are listed in Table 1. The a-HfO2 ﬁlm was
deposited onto Si(1 0 0) by magnetron sputtering Hf metal
target in a chamber ﬂowing with a mixed gas of Ar/O2
(ﬂow rate ratio = 2:4) at 150 C and 30 W RF gun power.
The surface roughness (Ra) is 2.3 nm and Jleak is around
8  107 A/cm2. By incorporating nitrogen into a-HfO2
using the gas ﬂow ratio Ar:O2:N2 = 2:4:14, the Ra value of
the a-HfON ﬁlm is reduced to 1.9 nm and the Jleak is
lowered down to 107 A/cm2 at an electric ﬁeld of 1 MV/

leakage current density (107 A/cm2). By lowering surface
roughness, the scattering probably is reduced in the trans-
port channel at the pentacene/a-HfON interface so that lFE
is enhanced. Moreover, the reduction of leakage current
density makes the drain current higher such that a higher
value of lFE can be obtained. Similarly, the VTH value of
OTFTs reduces from 0.9 to 0.7 V when nitrogen is incor-
porated into a-HfO2. The slight reduction of VTH is attrib-
uted to the generation of negative ﬁxed charges due to
the replacement of oxygen by nitrogen. For a-HfON with
a ﬂash Hf metal layer, VTH reduces further down from
0.7 to 0.3 V. The ﬂash Hf metal layer is very thin, which
is transformed into a-HfON at the interface during the
deposition process of a-HfON. The extra formation of a-
HfON due to the ﬂash Hf metal layer is not expected to re-
duce VTH. In 2008, Suemori et al. reported that the VTH va-
lue of a pentacene based OTFT was reduced by smoothing
the surface roughness of SiO2 gate dielectric [14]. The VTH
shift was attributed to lattice distortion in pentacene lay-
ers deposited on rough SiO2 surfaces. The VTH shift is
0.4 V in our work that is thus attributed to the reduction
of surface roughness. For OTFTs with either one of the
three gate dielectrics (a-HfO2, a-HfON, and a-HfON with a
ﬂash Hf metal layer), the Ion/Ioff values are about the same.
The Ion/Ioff value of the a-HfON–OTFT with a ﬂash Hf metal
layer is slightly higher, which is attributed to its lowest
leakage current density.
Since the subthreshold swing represents the interface
quality and the trap behavior [15], the maximum interface
trap density is approximated to be [16],
NSS ¼ S  logðeÞkT=q  1
 
 Ci
q
where S is the subthreshold swing; Ci is the capacitance per
unit area; k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. Substituting Ci = 787 nf/cm2 and S =
209 mV/decade, the approximate interface trap density is
determined to be 1.9  1013 cm2 eV1 for the a-HfON–
OTFT with the ﬂash Hf metal layer. The trap density is
lower than that of a-HfO2–OTFT and a-HfON–OTFT. This
indicates that the defects at the pentacene/a-HfON inter-
face can be lowered by ﬂashing a very thin Hf metal layer
before depositing HfON ﬁlm. Very probably, the defects at
the pentacene/a-HfON are strongly affected by the surface
roughness of a-HfON. With a smoother surface, a better
quality of pentacence can be deposited on the surface of
a-HfON at the beginning of the deposition. And the reduc-
tion of the interface trap density would speed up the
carrier transport, which is in agreement with the increase
of lFE.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, a-HfON–OTFTs exhibits better device
performance than a-HfO2–OTFTs since nitrogen incorpora-
tion into a-HfO2 can reduce leakage current density. The
device performance of a-HfON–OTFTs can be further im-
proved by ﬂashing a very thin Hf metal layer on the bottom
gate electrode before depositing the a-HfON gate dielectric.
The ﬂash Hf metal layer helps to reduce surface roughness
of the a-HfON gate dielectric. The fabrication of the Hf
ﬂashed a-HfON gate dielectric is a low temperature process
(150 C), which may be applicable to either metal or poly-
mer substrates and is potentially useful for soft organic
electronics.

1.5 min. A SABCC film was selectively deposited onto the
patterned Cu electrodes. The thickness of the SABCC film
can be adjusted by repeating the immersion step. The penta-
cene material obtained from Aldrich without any purification
was directly placed in a thermal coater for deposition. The
patterned pentacene film was deposited through a shadow
metal mask onto the SABCC/Cu/PET substrate by thermal
evaporation. The substrate was heated to 70 °C during the
deposition of pentacene at a pressure of 310−6 Torr. The
deposition rate of pentacene was around 0.3 Å/s, monitored
by a quartz crystal oscillator. Finally, Au was deposited
though a shadow metal mask and was defined as the source/
drain electrodes on the pentacene film. The channel width
and channel length were defined as 600 and 125 m, re-
spectively. The metal-insulator-metal structure of Cu/
SABCC/Cu was also fabricated to measure the dielectric
constant of the SABCC film. The dielectric constant of
SABCC was determined to be 3 at 1 MHz. Device perfor-
mance of the top contact SABCC-insulator OTFT devices on
the PET substrate can be extracted by device characteristic
curves that were carried out by the Agilent 4155c and Agi-
lent 4284 analyzers in air without any encapsulation. The

effect mobility , on/off current ratio ION/OFF, subthresh-

priate as the gate-insulator for an OTFT device, the device
performance of a SABCC-insulator OTFT and its leakage
current are characterized. Figures 3a and 3b show the

A double-thin-film structure of self-coated benzimidazole–copper complex SCBCC is utilized as the gate insulator for pentacene
organic thin film transistors OTFTs. The SCBCC double thin film is composed of a 2-heptyl benzimidazole–copper complex and
a 2-naphthalene-2-ylmethylbenzimidazole–copper complex. The fabrication features of the SCBCC double-thin-film are self-
coating, water-based processing, selectivity of deposition, and short time. The SCBCC double-thin-film insulator OTFT exhibits
better device performance than the SCBCC single-thin-film insulator OTFT made with the 2-heptyl benzimidazole–copper com-
plex. The field-effect mobility, on/off current ratio, and subthreshold swing of the SCBCC double-thin-film insulator OTFT are
determined to be 0.21 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.2  104, and 1.3 V/dec, respectively.

Organic thin film transistors OTFTs fabricated by solution pro-
cessing have attracted much attention due to their large area and low
cost.1 In the development of solution processing for OTFTs, organic
semiconductors, gate insulators, and electrodes have been the focus
in the past years.2,3 Among the solution-processed organic gate in-
sulators, polymers and the self-assembled monolayer SAM have
been intensively studied.4,5 The application of the SAM as gate in-
sulators for OTFTs was initially investigated by Vuillaume and
co-workers.6,7 SAM insulator OTFTs are usually fabricated on non-
flexible, rather than flexible, substrates due to better device
performance.8,9 In our recently published article,10 the concept of
self-assembling is applied to fabricate a benzimidazole–copper com-
plex insulator on the copper Cu gate electrode in a structure of
pentacene OTFT on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate PET
substrate. The benzimidazole–copper complex is named as a self-
coated benzimidazole–copper complex SCBCC because it is made
with a solution-based process using dip-coating. The SCBCC insu-
lator is made with the 2-heptyl benzimidazole–copper SCBCC-H
complex, a new material, as the gate insulator for OTFTs. The major
fabrication features of the SCBCC gate insulator are self-coating,
water-based processing, and selectivity of deposition only on Cu.
The field-effect FE mobility , on/off current ratio Ion/off, and
subthreshold swing SS of pentacene OTFT with the SCBCC insu-
lator are 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1, 4  103, and 4.4 V/dec,
respectively. In practice, the SCBCC film should be thick enough
350 nm to obtain good OTFT characteristics. However, a
thicker SCBCC gate insulator exhibits a larger surface roughness
Ra. The low magnitude of  is attributed to the rough surface of
SCBCC. To further enhance the device performance, in particular ,
a fabrication technique of a smooth SCBCC needs to be developed.
In this article, we present the fabrication of a smooth SCBCC
double-thin-film gate insulator and its pentacene OTFT perfor-
mance. The SCBCC double-thin-film gate insulator is made of an
SCBCC-H complex and a 2-naphthalene-2-ylmethyl
benzimidazole–copper SCBCC-N complex, which is self-coated
by dipping the Cu electrode into their respective water-based solu-
tions in sequence.
Benzimidazole is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound con-
sisting of benzene and imidazole. Two N atoms are located in the
opposite sides of imidazole in benzimidazole, through which Cu
ions can bond with benzimidazole to form an SCBCC layer on the
Cu surface.11 The SCBCC film is an organic complex, which was
also treated as a polymeric material in previously published
articles.12 The fabrication processing of the SCBCC is very similar
to the organic solderability preservative film processing, a well-
developed technique in the field of surface finish.13,14 Both 2-heptyl
benzimidazole and 2-naphthalen-2-ylmethyl benzimidazole com-
pounds are used to fabricate the benzimidazole–copper complex
double-thin-film structure SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N on patterned Cu
gate electrodes. The chemical structures of 2-heptyl benzimidazole
and 2-naphthalen-2-ylmethyl benzimidazole are sketched in Fig.
1a.
The SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N structure was implemented as the gate
insulator for top contact OTFT devices fabricated on a flexible PET
substrate. The top contact SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N insulator OTFT de-
vice is sketched in Fig. 1b. The fabrication of the SCBCC-H/
SCBCC-N insulator OTFT devices is described as follows. First, a
transparent PET substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with deionized
DI water for 10 min. Cu was deposited onto the as-cleaned PET
substrate by thermal evaporation with a shadow metal mask to form
patterned Cu gate electrode arrays directly. Two kinds of water-
based solutions of 2-substituted benzimidazole were prepared. The
first solution pH  2 was made with DI water, formic acid, acetic
acid, and 2-naphthalen-2-ylmethyl benzimidazole Chemwell,
99% purity. The second solution pH  3 was made with DI wa-
ter, acetic acid, and 2-heptyl benzimidazole Chemwell, 99% pu-
rity. The PET substrate with patterned Cu electrode arrays was
immersed into the first solution 27°C to form the
benzimidazole–copper complex layer SCBCC-N. The second so-
lution 40°C was employed to fabricate the benzimidazole–
copper complex layer SCBCC-H on the SCBCC-N layer. The
SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N insulator was formed selectively onto the pat-
terned Cu gate electrode array after immersion. The immersion time
for each layer was 1 min. Second, a patterned pentacene film was
deposited through a shadow metal mask onto the SCBCC-H/
SCBCC-N/Cu/PET substrate by thermal evaporation. The substrate
was heated to 70°C during the deposition of pentacene at a base
pressure of 3  10−6 Torr. The thickness of pentacene was
100 nm, monitored by a quartz crystal oscillator. Finally, Au was
deposited though a shadow metal mask and was defined as the
source/drain electrodes on the pentacene film. The thickness of Au
was 850 nm. The channel width and channel length were defined
as 600 and 125 m, respectively, to compare with our previously
reported device characteristics of the SCBCC-H insulator OTFT.
Capacitance and current measurements were performed on the
metal-insulator-metal MIM structures by using Agilent 4284A and
4155C, respectively. The device characteristics of the SCBCC-H/
SCBCC-N insulator OTFT devices on the PET substrate were car-
ried out by using Agilent 4155C analyzers in air. FE mobility ,
on/off current ratio Ion/off, and SS were used to characterize the
device performance.

and diffusion of Cu ions from the Cu electrode in an organic acid
occur in the self-coating process.
The formation of the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N structure can be veri-
fied by Raman analysis. The Raman spectra taken from the SCBCC-
H/SCBCC-N structure are shown in Fig. 2a, which exhibit promi-
nent peaks the same as those taken from the SCBCC-H film alone
also shown in Fig. 2a. To verify the existence of SCBCC-N in the
SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N double-thin-film structure, Raman spectra are
taken from a scratched SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N structure. Figure 2b
shows that the prominent Raman peaks taken from the scratched
SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N are the same as those from SCBCC-N. The
formation of the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N double-thin-film structure is
clearly supported by the Raman spectra.
The qualities of the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N dielectric bilayer are
characterized by capacitance–voltage C-V and current–voltage
I-V measurements. An MIM structure was made with copper and
the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N dielectric. Figure 3a shows the C-V
characteristics of the MIM structure at 1 MHz. The measured ca-
pacitance was determined to be 23.1 nF/cm2. The thickness and
dielectric constant of the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N bilayer are
120 nm and 3.1, respectively. The capacitance–frequency char-
acteristics of the MIM structure were measured at a fixed bias volt-
age of 13 V and are shown in the inset of Fig. 3a. The dielectric
constant is almost independent of frequency within the detection
range 10 K  1 MHz and close to 3 of SCBCC-H in a previ-
ously published article.10 Figure 3b shows the I-V characteristics of
the SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N bilayer. The maximum current density is
about 7  10−6 A/cm2 at a bias voltage of 13 V.
Figure 3c and d shows the output and transfer characteristics,
respectively, of a typical SCBCC-H/SCBCC-N insulator OTFT de-
vice fabricated on the PET substrate. The output curves exhibit typi-
cal OTFT characteristics that consist of very clear linear and satu-
ration regions within the drain–source voltage VDS of 11 V at a
gate–source voltage VGS varying from 0 to 11 V at steps of 2.6
V. The Ion/off and SS are determined to be 1.2  104 and 1.3 mV/
dec, respectively, from the transfer curve in Fig. 3d. The  can be
extracted from the transfer curve through the relationship between
the square root of drain saturated current IDS,sat1/2 and VGS, which

 Organic thin-fi lm transistors (OTFTs) are promising compo-
nents for fl exible and portable electronics, such as e-paper, [ 1–3 ] 
radio-frequency identifi cation (RFID) tags, [ 4,5 ] and biosen-
sors. [ 6,7 ] OTFTs usually exhibit very low switching speed and 
are diffi cult to use instead of inorganic thin-fi lm transistors 
(TFTs), although they possess the merits of fl exibility and 
low cost. Several challenges for OTFTs of large area are high 
fi eld-effect mobility ( μ FE ), low operating voltage, and solution 
processing. The  μ FE value and operating voltage of pentacene 
OTFTs strongly depend on the gate dielectric material. [ 8–10 ] 
Pentacene is usually deposited on various organic and inor-
ganic dielectrics, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), 
poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), SiO 2 , and AlN, using the bottom 
gate OTFT confi guration. [ 11–13 ] The reported  μ FE values are in 
the range of 0.5–4 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 and the operating voltages vary 
from –5 to –40 V. The low  μ FE values are mainly limited by the 
quality of pentacene and the interface scattering in OTFTs. 
Many attempts have been made to improve the  μ FE value by 
modifying the surface of the gate dielectric. The maximum 
 μ FE value has been improved to ca. 6 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 . [ 14 ] In 2004, 
Hosono’s group reported a  μ FE value larger than 10 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 
for amorphous InGaO 3 (ZnO) 5 (a-IGZO) TFTs. [ 15 ] The  μ FE value 
is much higher than that of pentacene OTFTs. The research in 
fl exible electronics has focused on a-IGZO TFTs since then, 
especially in the fi eld of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). 
However, the fl exibility of amorphous semiconducting oxide 
TFTs is lower than OTFTs. An urgent requirement of fl exible 
electronics is to fi nd fl exible materials able to improve greatly 
the  μ FE value of OTFTs. 
 Here we present a pentacene OTFT made on a fl exible 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic substrate with a very 
high  μ FE value of 23.2 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 in the saturation regime and 
a low operating voltage of –3 V. Silk fi broin was chosen as the 
gate dielectric and fabricated in thin fi lm form by a low-cost 
solution process at room temperature. The device performance 
is so high that the pentacene OTFTs outperform a-IGZO TFTs. 
 Silk fi broin is one of the silk proteins emitted by the silk-
worm; silk fi broin forms the structural center of silk and sericin 
surrounds it. Silk fi broin is a natural biopolymer consisting of 
the repeated amino acid sequence of alternating Gly and Ala [ 16 ] 
( Figure  1 a). The silk fi broin thin fi lm in our work is amorphous 
and its secondary structure is characterized by the Fourier 
transform infrared–attenuated total refl ection (FTIR-ATR) spec-
trum in Figure  1 b. The silk fi broin thin fi lm consists of turn 
(ca. 1666, ca. 1678, ca. 1690 cm  − 1 ), random-coil (ca. 1642, ca. 
1651 cm  − 1 ),  α -helix (ca. 1659 cm  − 1 ), and hydrogen-bonded C = O 
(ca. 1704 cm  − 1 ) according to the curve-fi tting results based on 
previously published FTIR-ATR data. [ 17 ] Silk fi broin has been 
used as a material for contact lenses, [ 18 ]  a platform for transis-
tors, [ 19 ] and photonic devices, [ 20 ] owing to its unique characteris-
tics of optical transparency, electrical insulation, and fl exibility. 
 A silk fi broin aqueous solution of ca. 2% (wt/v) was prepared 
for the thin-fi lm deposition in accordance with the published 
procedure. [ 21 ] Cocoons of  Bombyx mori were boiled for 20 min 
in an aqueous solution of 0.5% Na 2 CO 3 , and then rinsed with 
deionized water to extract the glue-like sericin proteins. The 
leftover silk fi broin was dissolved in 85% phosphoric acid at 
60  ° C for 1 h, yielding a 50% (wt/v) solution. The solution was 
dialyzed against deionized water using a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis 
cassette (MWCO 14000, Pierce, Rockford, IL)  at room temper-
ature for 3 days to remove the phosphoric acid. The dialyzed 
solution was further fi ltered to obtain an electronic-grade silk 
fi broin aqueous solution of ca. 2% (wt/v). 
 A pentacene OTFT with silk fi broin as the gate dielectric and 
Au as top electrodes in the bottom gate confi guration is sketched 
in  Figure  2 a. The pentacene OTFTs on PET are fl exible and rol-
lable (Figure  2 b). A silk fi broin thin fi lm of 30 nm thickness was 
coated onto the PET substrate patterned with Au gate electrodes 
by spin coating. A dipping step is required to obtain a thicker 
silk fi broin gate layer. After dipping, the samples were dried 
on a hot plate at 50  ° C for 30 min. The silk fi broin thin fi lm 
is ca. 420 nm thick, as determined by fi eld emission scanning 
electron microscopy (FESEM; Figure  2 a). The FESEM image 
showing the silk fi broin thin fi lm on the Au gate electrode was 
diffi cult to obtain since the silk fi broin thin fi lm was easily 
bent during electron bombardment. A 70-nm-thick pentacene 
layer (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was then deposited onto the dry 
silk fi broin thin fi lm by thermal evaporation at room tempera-
ture. The surface roughness of the silk fi broin thin fi lm is ca. 
0.3 nm, as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM; 
Figure  2 c). The fl at surface of the silk fi broin thin fi lm is impor-
tant for the fabrication of OTFTs with good device performance. 
Au was used to defi ne the source and drain electrodes in the 
pentacene OTFT. The channel length and width were 75  μ m 
and 600  μ m, respectively. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction 
(GIXRD) was performed to characterize the crystal quality of 
pentacene by using a diffractometer (Rigaku TTRax III) with 
Cu K α radiation (wavelength  λ  = 1.54 Å). The capacitance of 
the silk fi broin thin fi lm was measured using an Agilent 4284 
impedance analyzer. A quasi-static capacitance versus voltage 
curve was taken at a sweep rate of 0.25 V s  − 1 using a Keithley 
595 quasi-static CV meter. Current–voltage characteristics

where the channel length and width are 50 and 600  μ m, respec-
tively. Figure  4 b illustrates good inverter performance, where 
the output voltage switches between –2.5 V (the applied supply 
voltage  V DD ) and 0 V as the input gate voltage is swept from 
–3 to 1 V. The inverter is sketched in the inset in Figure  4 b. 
The output voltage of the inverter responds well to a 1 MHz 
square-wave input voltage signal. The switching speed depends 
on the channel length. Higher switching speed is expected if 
the channel length is further shortened. In 2008, Cho et al. 
reported that an inverter made of an OTFT with poly(3-hexy-
lthiophene) (P3HT) with a  μ FE,sat value of 2 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 . [ 25 ] The 
channel length and width are 20 and 1400  μ m, respectively, in 
their design. The switching speed of their stand-alone inverter 
can reach 10 kHz. The much higher switching speed (1 MHz) 
in our present case results from the very high  μ FE,sat value, 
which demonstrates the potential for practical applications. 
 For a typical fabrication process of pentacene OTFTs, the pen-
tacene thin fi lm deposited on a dielectric layer by thermal evap-
oration usually consists of amorphous and crystalline phases. [ 26 ] 
In contrast, a great reduction of amorphous pentacene occurs 
when pentacene is deposited onto silk fi broin, which is sup-
ported by the GIXRD spectra in  Figure  5 a, where the same 
thickness (25 nm) of pentacene was deposited onto SiO 2 and 
yields a maximum interface trap density ( N ss ) of ca. 3.12  × 
10 11 cm  − 2 eV  − 1 , derived from  [ 24 ]

 where  S is the subthreshold swing;  C i is the capacitance per unit 
area;  k B is Boltzmann’s constant, and  T is the absolute temper-
ature. The very low  N ss value serves as experimental evidence 
for the formation of a good pentacene/silk fi broin interface. 
Furthermore, very small hysteresis appears in the  I DS –  V GS 
curves at a constant  V DS of –3 V (Figure  3 e), indicating very 
low charge trap density at or near the pentacene/silk fi broin 
interface. This supports that only very few ionic impurities 
reside inside the silk fi broin thin fi lm. The very low charge trap 
density also explains well the low threshold voltage (–0.77 V). 
Only a low gate voltage is required to attract holes to fi ll the 
charge trap states before accumulation occurs during operation 
of the OTFT, which results in a low threshold voltage. 
 The very high  μ FE,sat value was further confi rmed by meas-
uring the switching speed for an inverter made of a pentacene 
OTFT and an external resistor of 200 k Ω . The transfer charac-
teristics of the OTFT in the inverter are shown in  Figure  4 a,

 μ FE,sat value of our OTFTs is attributed to the preferred forma-
tion of the pentacene orthorhombic phase on silk fi broin. The 
pentacene orthorhombic phase acts as the channel for carrier 
transport in OTFTs. Moreover, the  μ FE,sat value of 23.2 cm 2 V  − 1 
s  − 1 is much larger than 0.22 cm 2 V  − 1 s  − 1 determined for the pen-
tacene OTFT with SiO 2 as the gate dielectric that was fabricated 
for comparison in our work. The low  μ FE,sat value of 0.22 cm 2 
V  − 1 s  − 1 is strongly correlated with the large amount of amor-
phous pentacene on SiO 2 , as sketched in Figure  5 c. Another 
factor affecting the  μ FE,sat value is the quality of the pentacene/
dielectric interface. The preferred formation of polycrystalline 
pentacene orthorhombic phase indicates that the pentacene/
silk fi broin interface is very good. This leads to a very low inter-
face trap density of ca. 3.12  × 10 11 cm  − 2 eV  − 1 , which is at least 
one order of magnitude lower than the reported values for other 
pentacene OTFTs. [ 30 ] This may partially contribute to the very 
high  μ FE,sat value as a result of low interface scattering. More-
over, the carrier injection from the top Au electrode also affects 
the  μ FE,sat value. The large amount of pentacene thin-fi lm phase 
on silk fi broin (Figure  5 d) also favors the  I DS,sat value and may 
make a partial contribution to the very high  μ FE,sat value. 
 Our results show that the operating speed of pentacene 
OTFTs can be greatly improved by the correct selection of the 
gate dielectric material. Silk fi broin increases the potential of 
pentacene OTFTs as high speed devices with the ability to out-
perform a-IGZO TFTs in display technologies. The merits of 
silk fi broin in OTFTs are its low cost, light weight, and large 
area, which give it great potential for a wide variety of applica-
tions, especially e-paper, RFID tags, and biosensors.
