1. Introduction 
In the 1960s, the mathematician Benoît 
Mandelbrot had been indicated the fractal 
objects whose complex geometry cannot be 
characterized by an integral dimension [1]. It 
represents fractal applies to objects in space or 
fluctuations in time that possess a form of 
self-similarity [2]. Self-similarity is one way to 
calculate fractal dimension. For example, one 
can subdivide a line segment into m 
self-similar intervals, each with the same 
length, and each of which can be magnified by 
a factor of n to yield the original segment [3]. 
Due to the fractal geometry is an 
approximately copy of the whole. Hence, the 
fractal dimension is consistent over a wide 
range of scales, which is known as scale 
invariance [4]. 
DFA method was developed from a modified 
root mean square analysis of a random walk to 
exclude the local trend induced by 
characteristic time scales from the fluctuations 
of the multi-component systems, and get a 
long-range correlation [5-7]. It was originally 
a method to measure scale invariant behavior 
developed by Peng et al. that evaluated trends 
of all sizes in the presence or absence of 
fractal correlation properties of time series 
data [8,9]. This method has been applied to 
heart rate dynamics such as autonomic nervous 
system [10], congestive heart failure [8], 
dilated cardiomyopathy [11], ventricular 
fibrillation [12], and other physiological 
non-stationary time series systems (DNA 
sequences [13], neuron spiking [14,15], human 
gait analysis [16], electroencephalogram (EEG) 
in sleep [17-20], stock returns [21], periodic 
trends [22], estimating dependence [23] etc.). 
Experience has shown that mono-dimensional 
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) used in 
the scaling analysis of fractal time series is 
accurate and easy to implement regardless in 
long-term and short-term time scale series [24, 
25]. In recent years, there are some modified 
DFA method researches are proposed such as 
generalized the mono-dimensional DFA and 
multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis 
(MFDFA) to higher dimensional versions and 
derived multifractal detrended 
cross-correlation analysis method to 
investigate the multifractal behaviors in the 
power-law cross-correlations between two 
time series or higher-dimensional quantities 
recorded [26-28]. Those study results validated 
well for distinguishing fractal/multifractal 
properties of synthetic surfaces, one/two 
dimensional cross-correlation of two financial 
time series, and linear/nonlinear correlation 
analysis of traffic time series. 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is

A straight line of log F(n) vs. log n plot 
indicates the presence of power law (fractal) 
correlation between scales and the fluctuations 
of the detrended time series. The slope of 
log-log plot is defined the DFA scaling 
exponent α. The larger value of the scaling 
exponent α represents the smoother the time 
series [6]. 
As the application of DFA in image analysis, 
two-dimensional algorithm of DFA should be 
refined in both integration and detrending 
processes. Moreover, the least square plans 
with size of s × s were used to fit the sth 
segment of local trends in images. Then, we 
can remove the sth trend from the integrated 
image to derive the sth fluctuation. DFA 
scaling exponent is defined as the power-law 
correlation between the using scales and the 
derived fluctuations. Finally, we can get the 
DFA scaling exponent α by the straight line of 
log F(s) vs. log s plot. 
 
2.3. Statistical analysis 
Values were expressed as means ± SD. Data 
were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) (SigmaStat statistical software, 
Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The Tukey 
test was conducted for multiple comparisons 
when the null hypothesis was not applicable 
for the same group. It also was used for all 
pairwise comparisons of the mean responses to 
the different treatment groups. Differences 
were considered significant at a value of P < 
0.05. 
 
3. Results 
3.1 Simulation 
We use 24 images (960×720 pixels) to check 
our inference of DFA method in image 
analysis. Different shape, color and size 
images are used. The image shape has circle 
and square two types, which color has white, 
black, red, green, blue and mix color six 
modes, and size has large and small two 
categories. The short-term correlation 
exponent α1 was calculated within the range 
between s = 4 and s = 11 [7,37,38], and the 
long-term correlation exponent α2 was 
calculated within the range of s between s = 12 
and s = min(M/4,N/4). We selected α1 to 
calculate total 24 simulation images and 
compared between the different shape, color 
and size as shown in Table 2. 
 
3.2 BL and DLBCL image calculated results 
Like simulation images, we used α1 to 
calculate total 38 lymphoma images of three 
groups. From Table 3, the mean values of the 
short-term correlation exponent α1 of groups 
A, B, and C are 0.370±0.033, 0.382±0.022 and 
0.435±0.053, respectively. We were found that 
the α1 value of BL image (both low and high 
grade BL) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) 
than DLBCL image. Hence, it can be 
concluded that α1 values based on DFA 
statistics concept can clearly distinguish 
pathologic states between BL and DLBCL 
images.  
 
4. Conclusions 
The DFA method almost use in time series 
data field. We try applied DFA method in 
image analysis. The two-dimensional matrix 
algorithm of DFA both in integration and 
detrending processes was derived. In this 
paper, the DFA method has been used to 
investigate the characteristic of different type
