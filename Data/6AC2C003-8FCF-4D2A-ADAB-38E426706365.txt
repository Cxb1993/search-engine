Abstract 
The amount of pollutants produced 
during manufacturing processes of 
TFT-LCD (Thin-film transistor liquid 
crystal display) substantially increases 
due to an increasing production of the 
opto-electronic industry in Taiwan. The 
total amount of wastewater from 
TFT-LCD manufacturing plants is 
expected to exceed 200,000 CMD in the 
near future. Typically, organic solvents 
used in TFT-LCD manufacturing 
processes account for more than 33% of 
the total TFT-LCD wastewater. The 
main components of these organic 
solvents are composed of the stripper 
(dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 
monoethanolamine (MEA)), developer 
(tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide 
(TMAH)) and chelating agents. These 
compounds are recognized as non- or 
slow-biodegradable organic compounds 
and little information is available 
regarding their biological treatability. 
This study was conducted to 
evaluate the long-term performance of 
two bioreactors, anaerobic-aerobic (A/O) 
sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and 
aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR), 
treating synthetic TFT-LCD wastewater 
containing DMSO, MEA, and TMAH 
with different loadings.  For the A/O 
SBR, the influent wastewater was 
composed of 800 mg MEA/L, 430 mg 
DMSO/L, and 90 mg TMAH/L, 
respectively.  After reaching 
steady-state, SBR was able to achieve 
more than 99% degradation efficiencies 
for the three compounds examined.  
For the case of aerobic MBR, the 
influent wastewater was composed of 
550 mg MEA/L, 270 mg DMSO/L, and 
330 mg TMAH/L, respectively, and 
degradation efficiencies for the three 
compounds achieved more than 99%. 
Although both different reactors shared 
similar and satisfactory degradation 
efficiencies for DMSO, MEA, and 
TMAH, the microbial ecology of these 
two reactors, as elucidated with 
molecular methods, was apparently 
different.  The 16S rDNA-based 
cloning/sequencing results indicated that 
the dominant sequences retrieved from 
the aerobic MBR, including 
Hyphomicrobium denitrificans, 
Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii, 
Rhodobacter sp., and Methyloversatilis 
universalis, showed a clear linkage to 
their physiological properties of DMSO 
and TMAH degradation.  On the other 
hand, Zoogloea sp., Chlorobium 
chlorochromatii, Agricultural soil 
bacterium, and Flavosolibacter 
ginsengiterrae were proliferated in the 
A/O SBR Run1, while Thiobacillus sp., 
 4
al., 1981; Zinder and Brock, 1978), so 
anaerobic process is usually used to treat 
DMSO containing wastewater. But in 
such process, malodorous toxic 
compounds such as DMS and H2S, 
which cause other environmental 
problems, may be produced. Some 
research groups suggested using a 
combination of advanced oxidation 
process and biological process to 
enhance the efficiency of DMSO 
degradation (Koito et al., 1998). It has 
been shown that many microorganisms, 
such as Escherichia coli (Bilous and 
Weiner, 1985), Klebsiella sp., Serratia 
sp., Citrobacter braakii (Luckarift et al., 
2004), Cryptococcus humicolus 
(Murakami-Nitta et al., 2003), 
Hyphomicrobium species. (De Bont et 
al., 1981; Suylen et al., 1986; 
Murakami-Nitta et al., 2002; Kino et al., 
2004), and Rhodobacter capsulatus 
(Kappler et al., 2002), are capable of 
degrading DMSO under different 
cultural conditions.  The metabolic 
pathway of DMSO degradation by 
Hyphomicrobium sp. has been studied in 
detail as shown in Figure 1 (De Bont et 
al., 1981).  
MEA is a viscous colorless liquid 
with amine and alcohol functional 
groups in the same molecule. As a result, 
it undergoes a wide variety of reactions 
common to amine and alcohol. MEA can 
act as carbon and nitrogen source at the 
same time, therefore, no extra nitrogen 
source is needed. MEA is hydrolyzed to 
ammonia and acetate as shown figure 2. 
(Ndegwa et al., 2004) The 
biodegradation of MEA has been studied 
by different groups (Ndegwa et al., 2004; 
Knapp et al., 1996; Lai and Shieh, 1996).  
TMAH is used as the major component 
of positive photoresist developers in the 
photolithography process of LCD 
manufacturing. The degradation of 
waste fluid contained TMAH is usually 
difficult in activated sludge treatment. 
 
Figure 1. Degradation pathway of DMSO (De Bont et al., 1981). 
(Urakami et al., 1990) The proposed 
intermediate substances in TMAH 
degradation are trimethylamine, 
dimethylamine, methylamine, and 
formaldehyde as in figure 3. (Anthony, 
1982) But these intermediate 
compounds were not detected during the 
biodegradation of TMAH, only 
ammonium ion was found. (Urakami et 
al., 1990) During degradation of these 
nitrogen-containing compounds, 
ammonia can be released, resulting in an 
 6
biodegradation of DMSO, MEA, and 
TMAH lacks. Several studies have 
shown the feasibility of biological 
degradation on individual compounds of 
MEA, DMSO, and TMAH, but the 
biodegradability study on their mixture 
is relatively few.  Furthermore, the 
community members responsible for 
TFT-LCD wastewater treatment in 
biological processes have never been 
investigated.  In this study, aerobic 
membrane bioreactor (MBR) and 
anoxic-oxic sequencing batch reactor 
(A/O SBR) was used for evaluating the 
efficiency of bio-degradation of the 
synthetic TFT-LCD manufacturing 
wastewater. Batch tests were also 
conducted to find the optimum condition 
for bio-degradation of DMSO, MEA and 
TMAH. Besides traditional water 
analysis, molecular tools including 
cloning/sequencing techniques and 
terminal restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (T-RFLP) methodology 
were employed to study the microbial 
ecology developed in an aerobic MBR 
and an A/O SBR treating TFT-LCD 
wastewater.   
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Anoxic/Oxic Sequencing Batch Reactor 
(A/O SBR) 
A 10L SBR with a working volume 
of 8L was used in this study (Figure 501) 
to evaluate biodegradability of 
TFT-LCD wastewater under A/O 
operation conditions.  The seeding 
sludge for the A/O SBR was obtained 
from a TFT-LCD wastewater treatment 
plant.  Synthetic wastewater containing 
stripper (DMSO and MEA) and TMAH 
wastewater, obtained from the TFT-LCD 
manufacturing process, together with 
additional nutrients, was used as influent.  
The main components of the nutrients 
were: NaHCO3 (600 mg/L), K2HPO4 (30 
mg/L), MgSO4 (20 mg/L), FeCl3 (10 
mg/L), CoCl2 (1 mg/L), Yeast extract 
(1mg/L), Na2MoO4 (1mg/L) and CuCl2 
(1mg/L) (Lai and Shieh, 1996).  The 
SBR was operated in a 24-hour cycle 
mode as shown in Figure 2. The mixed 
liquor volume in the SBR at the 
beginning and the end of the fill were 5 
and 8 L, respectively and 3 L of treated 
supernatant was withdrawn after settling.  
Mixed liquor was withdrawn daily at the 
end of the aerobic phase to maintain a 
target sludge age. The pH in the SBR 
was controlled at 7±0.1 using a pH 
controller with addition of 5% of H3PO4 
and 2% of NaOH throughout the 
experiments. 
 
Aerobic Membrane bioreactor (MBR) 
    A lab-scale submerged 
membrane bioreactor (MBR) was used 
to treat TFT-LCD wastewater in this 
study.  The working volume was 40 L 
with an internal diameter and length of 
27 and 70 cm, respectively.  The 
membrane module developed by KNH 
Enterprise Co., Ltd. Taiwan was a 
frame-plate type made by nonwoven 
materials with a filtration surface of 0.47 
m2.  The permeable flux of membrane 
2%

suspended solid (SS) (Standard Method 
2540D) and volatile suspended solid 
(VSS) (Standard Method 2540E) are 
analyzed using methods described in 
Standard Methods for the examination 
of Water and Wastewater. (APHA, 1995) 
Samples of DMSO, MEA and 
TMAH were filtered through a 0.2μm 
membrane filter before analysis. The 
concentration of DMSO was measured 
by Shimadzu 14-B gas chromatography 
with a flame ionization detector 
(GC-FID) (Shimazu, Japan). The 
column used was Restek Rtx-1 60m x 
0.53mm x 1.00um and the carrier gas 
was N2. A dionex-120 ionic 
chromatography (IC) equipped with 
Dionex Ion Pac CS15 and CG15 
columns, is used for MEA and TMAH 
measurement. The suppressor used was 
CSRS Ultra II 4-mm. 
 
DNA extractions and Polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)  
    The UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation 
Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Solana Beach, 
CA) was used to obtain genomic DNA 
from the activated sludge samples.  An 
universal primer set including forward a 
primer 11F (5’ 
GTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3’) and a 
reverse primer 1512R (5’ 
TACCTTGTTACGACTT 3’) was used 
for amplifying a 1500-bp fragment of 
16S rDNA gene of bacteria (Kane et al., 
1993). The thermal profile used for the 
amplification was: a hotstart at 95 ℃ for 
3 min, 26 cycles of denaturation (1.5 
min at 95 ℃), annealing (45 s at 52 ℃) 
and extension (2 min at 72 ℃), and a 
final extension at 72 ℃ for 3 min. 
 
Clone library construction and analysis  
    PCR products (1501bp) of 
11F-1512R were purified by 
electrophoresis in a 1.5% (wt/vol) 
agarose gel, recovered using a gel 
purification kit (Gene-Spin TM 1-4-3 
DNA extraction Kit), and used in the 
construction of the 16S rDNA clone 
libraries.  The purified PCR products 
were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy 
Vector System (Promega, Madison, WI, 
USA) and transformed into into DH5α 
Escherichia coli competent cells 
following the manufacture’s protocol 
(Invitrogen).  Plasmids of clones were 
extracted by WizardR Plus minipreps 
DNA purification system (Promega, 
Madison, WI, USA). DNA sequencing 
reactions were performed using ABI 
3100 and 3730 capillary sequencers 
(Applied Biosystems) and sequencing 
was performed at the National Cheng 
Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.   
 
Phylogenetic and molecular 
evolutionary analyses  
    BioEdit was used to align cloned 
and published sequences.  The 16S 
rDNA sequences of representative 
clones were aligned and compared to 
available 16S rDNA sequences in 
GenBank using the NCBI BLAST 
program (Altschul et al., 1997).  Finally, 
phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary

respectively. 
 
Time-course profile of A/O SBR in one 
cycle 
Time-course profiles of the A/O 
SBR in one cycle for both runs were 
monitored at day 31 (Run 1) and day 
203 (Run 2), respectively, as shown in 
Figure 3.  Similar trend was observed 
in the degradation of the three 
compounds for both runs.  MEA and 
TMAH showed good degradability 
under anoxic conditions.  TMAH and 
MEA were completely degraded within 
1 and 3 hrs, respectively.  For DMSO, 
the results were slightly different 
between the two runs.  About 25 mg/L 
of DMSO was degraded in the anoxic 
phase in Run 1, but almost no 
degradation was observed in the anoxic 
phase in Run 2.  This may be caused by 
a higher nitrate concentration presented 
at the beginning of anoxic phase in Run 
2. In the study of De Bont et al.(1981), 
DMSO was proposed to serve as 
electron acceptor in the reaction. Since 
nitrate is an alternate electron acceptor, 
higher initial nitrate concentration may

inhibit the bacterial utilization of 
DMSO.   
The ammonia, nitrite and nitrate 
concentration profiles are presented in 
Figure 3b and 3d. Under anoxic 
conditions, nitrate concentration 
decreased due to denitrification while 
the ammonia concentration increased.  
The increased ammonia concentration 
implies that MEA and TMAH may be 
degraded, resulting in release of 
ammonia, since the only nitrogen source 
 12
LCD50/LCD18/LCD36 (representing 
6%) were related to Rhodobacter sp., 
which may possess ability of degrading 
DMSO with DMSO reductase (Adams 
et al., 1999; Kappler et al., 2002).  
Clone LCD66 (6%) was closely related 
to Methyloversatilis universalis, which 
can utilize methanol, methylated amines, 
formaldehyde and formate, as well as a 
variety of organic compounds 
(Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2006), and may 
account for TMAH degradation in the 
aerobic MBR.  The remaining clones 
LCD67 (7%), LCD83 (4%) were 
affiliated with Hydrogenophaga sp., and 
Acidobacteriaceae bacterium, 
respectively. 
    Cloned sequences retrieved from 
the A/O SBR Run1 were clustered with 
diverse populations including Zoogloea 
sp., Chlorobium chlorochromatii, 
Flavosolibacter ginsengiterrae and 
Agricultural soil bacterium clone 
SC-I-12., without a clear known linkage 
to their ability in degrading TFT-LCD 
wastewater compounds.  On the other 
hand, for the cloned sequences retrieved 
from the Run2, clones AOII57 and 
AOII58, which were affiliated with 
Thiobacillus group, were dominant in 
the Run2.  The presence of DMSO 
reductase in Thiobacillus denitrificans 
ATCC 25259 suggests that T. 
denitrificans may use DMSO as an 
electron acceptor and account for its 
degradation under anaerobic conditions  
(Beller et al., 2006). Clone AOII95, 
closely related to Nitrosomonas sp. 
Nm47, which may account for ammonia 
oxidation, was found in the A/O SBR 
Run2.  Furthermore, clone AOII63, 
appearing in Run2, was related to 
anaerobic denitrifiers Thauera 
aromatica and Azoarcus sp. (Anders et 
al., 1995).   
    In comparison of microbial ecology 
of the aerobic MBR and A/O SBR, the 
dominant sequences retrieved from the 
aerobic MBR showed a clear linkage to 
their physiological properties reported in 
previous studies, while those from the 
A/O SBR did not, although both 
bioreactors performed satisfactory 
removal performance for DMSO, 
TMAH, and MEA.  A possible 
explanation for this observed difference 
is that a higher organic loading (Table 2) 
applied for the aerobic MBR provided 
an enriched condition for TFT-LCD 
degrading bacteria, resulting in a distinct 
population responsible for TFT-LCD 
wastewater treatment.   
 14
T-RFLP Biomonitoring of 
LCD-degrading bacteria 
    A T-RFLP methodology was 
developed based on the sequencing 
results obtained from the aerobic MBR 
and applied to determine the TFT-LCD 
degrading populations in the aerobic 
MBR. The expected terminal fragments 
and the corresponding TFT-LCD 
degrading bacteria, as well as the 
TRFLP electropherogram results of 
TFT-LCD degrading populations in the 
aerobic MBR, are shown in Figure 5.   
The TRFLP profiles for Runs 3 and 4 
were dominated by terminal fragments 
at 646 bp, 679 bp, and 741 bp, 
representing DMSO-degrading bacteria, 
and TFs at 763 bp, representing 
TMAH-degrading bacteria.  The TFs at 
646 bp, 679 bp, 741 bp, and 763 bp 
remained present in Run 5, but 
electropherogram intensity of 
TMAH-degrading bacteria (763 bp) 
decreased, corresponding to a slightly 
decrease in removal efficiency of 
TMAH.
