ABSTRACT 
 
This two years project performs a simulation investigation into the nonlinear static and 
dynamic characteristics of electrostatically driven shaped micro-actuators in 
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). 
The model proposed in the current nonlinear pull-in deflection study considers various 
boundary conditions for the electrostatically actuated structures, e.g. the cantilever beam and the 
fixed-fixed beam, and takes account of the electrical field fringing effect and the axial residual 
stress. Initially, the Adomian decomposition method is employed to evaluate the response of a 
micro-actuator incorporating a rectangular micro-beam and a flat electrode by obtaining the 
closed-form solution of the corresponding nonlinear equation. Since no iteration is required in 
solving the nonlinear deformation, this decomposition method is one of the most efficient 
methods available for evaluating the unstable pull-in behavior of an electrostatically driven 
micro-actuator.  
The present study implements both small and large deflection assumptions when simulating 
the response of the micro-actuator in order to explore the possible effects of the two models on 
the accuracy of the simulation results. The shaped micro-beam with a curved electrode 
micro-actuator is further assessed using the differential quadrature method (DQM) to examine 
the influence of the nonlinear pull-in effect. This project also studies the contact force and the 
pull-in deflection of shaped micro-tweezers. The DQM is employed to solve the nonlinear 
interaction between the curved electrostatic field force and the corresponding deflection of the 
shaped cantilever actuators. The numerical results confirm the ability of the DQM to treat this 
form of nonlinear actuator problem accurately, efficiently and systematically. 
To evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the electrostatic micro-actuator, the DQM is

1.1 Electrostatic Micro-Electro-M  
Peterson [4-5] introduced a fabrication procedure for an electrostatic deflectable 
metal-coated oxide cantilever beam with a planar electrode as a light modulator array for 
micro-mechanical switches. Meanwhile, in 1995 Yasuda et al. [6] fabricated a micro-electrostatic 
elastic joint and investigated its on-off control characteristics. Elwenspoek et al. [7] proposed an 
active joint using a bent micro-beam pulled against a fixed electrode. Attia and Tremblay [8] 
fabricated gold microstructures for low-voltage electrostatically actuated switches and conducted 
a nu
Chen et al. [9] and MacDonald et al. [10] developed and simulated the chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) of tungsten with an isolated silicon dioxide for the micro-electro-mechanical 
structures of micro-tweezers. Meanwhile, a hybrid FEM-BEM method was proposed to solve the 
nonlinear-coupled electrostatic and mechanical equations for micro-tweezers [11] (Shi et al., 
1995). The SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technique has also been presented for the fabrication of 
echanical Systems (MEMS)
Electrostatic actuators possess the inherent advantages of good scaling properties, reduced 
power driving characteristics, large deflection capabilities, and relatively straightforward 
fabrication processes. Hence, the use of electrostatic-actuator applications in 
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) has increased significantly in recent years. 
Electrostatically driven actuators are key components of many of today’s MEMS systems, and 
have been incorporated in a wide variety of electrostatic micro-systems, as described below.

microstructures were also investigated.

1.1.2 Micro-sensors and Micro-actuators 
Electrostatic resonators, with their high precision, good performance, relative ease of 
fabrication, and low power consumption, are fundamental components of many 
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Electrostatically actuated micro-sensors, 
micro-resonators and micro-actuators are comprised of an electrostatically driven micro-beam 
and a fixed electrode. Static deflection of the micro-beam not only alters the capacitance of the 
resonator, but may also shift the natural frequencies of the micro-beam. 
Laterally driven polysilicon resonant microstructures were investigated by Tang et al. [25] 
in 1989. Meanwhile, capacitive pressure sensors with large deflections were assessed by Tong et 
al. [26], and a resonant beam type pressure sensor was fabricated and investigated by Petersen 
[27]. Kiesewetter et al. [28] employed the resonant method to determine the Young’s modulus of 
0.54 mµ  LPCVD SixNy films in 1992. 
Zook et al. [29] proposed beam and plate finite element models, which took shear 
deformation and rotary inertia aspects into consideration, but excluded mid-plane stretching, to 
calculate the natural frequencies of a micro-beam subjected to axial loads. A comparison of the 
numerical results with those measured experimentally demonstrated that the simulated data were 
slightly higher than their measured counterparts. No significant difference was identified 
between the results of the two types of models. The static and dynamic responses of an 
electrostatically actuated micro-beam were investigated by Ijntema and Tilmans in 1992 [30], 
thereby realizing the air-gap capacitor characteristics of this type of actuator. In this study, an 
 4
Bienstman et al. [38] presented the characteristics of an oscillator circuit for electrostatically 
driven one-port resonators.  
Legtenberg et al. [39-40] proposed the use of curved electrodes as a means of realizing 
large-displacement actuators. Meanwhile, the designed and fabricated process of curved 
electrode using surface micro-machined method was also shown in Fig. 1-1 and Fig. 1-2. In 1997, 
Osterberg and Senturia [41] employed electrostatic pull-in results obtained from various actuator 
structures, including cantilever beams, fixed-fixed beams, and clamped diaphragms, to obtain the 
Young’s modulus and residual stress in micro-actuators. A three-dimensional coupled 
electromechanical model was proposed to represent the interaction between the actuator 
deflection and the electrostatic force, and the Rayleigh-Ritz method was utilized to solve the 
associated 1-D small deflection energy models. The simulation results were then compared with 
the corresponding experimental data reported in the literature. Various designs for the shaped 
beam and curved electrode were proposed by Hirai et al. [42-43]. The nonlinear large bending 
deflection effect was emphasized in the formulation.  
Electrostatic forces and their effects on different capacitive mechanical actuators were 
investigated by Puers and Lapadatu [44]. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional modeling of contact 
problems and mechanical hysteresis in coupled electro-mechanics was presented by Gillbert et al.
[45]. Lee and Chao [46] applied a quality factor control method for laterally driven 
micromechanical resonant microstructures. To avoid pull-in instability, Seeger and Crary [47] 
proposed the simple addition of a series capacitance to extend the operational range of 
electrostatically actuated mechanical devices. A novel type of low voltage, large deflection 
electrostatic micro-actuator was developed by Yasuda et al. [48]. In 1998, Gill et al. [49] 
introduced the concept, analysis, fabrication and testing of a new anchor without the additional 
 
 6
actuator incorporating a corrugated membrane was designed, fabricated and tested [62]. 
Madanagopal and Tien [63] presented the system design and open loop positioning of a large 
displacement, single crystal silicon, folded spring lateral actuator. Since the measurement of 
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) geometries is critical in the design and fabrication of 
MEMS devices, an electrostatically driven laterally resonant comb-drive test structure with a 
prescribed change in spring width was proposed by Gupta, 2000 [64]. In 2001, Yael and Ofir [65] 
derived a model for the pull-in parameters of a general electrostatic actuator with a single input. 
A laterally driven electrostatic repulsive-force induced by an asymmetric distribution of the 
planar electrostatic field was presented by Lee and Chao [66]. Emmanuel et al. [67] introduced 
an advanced 3-D self-assembling technique for surface micro-machined polysilicon structures to 
realize actuators for optical applications such as micro-mirror arrays with large deflection angles. 
To enhance the accuracy of the calculated natural frequencies around the electrostatically 
actuated deflected micro-beam, Abdel-Rahman, Younis and Nayfeh [68] considered the 
mid-plane stretching effect. The analytical results indicated that the failure to consider this 
stretching effect might cause the stability limits of the model to be underestimated significantly. 
It was demonstrated that the nonlinear micro-beam model could provide designers to use a wide 
range of dc polarization voltages in resonators. Pamidighantam et al. [69] recently derived the 
closed-form solutions for simplified fixed-fixed and fixed-free micro-beam actuators. 
Microstructures with either symmetrical or asymmetrical actuated, resulting in different pull-in 
voltages and operational specifications such as hysteresis and reproducibility, were examined by 
Rocha et al., 2002 [70]. Li and Aluru [71] presented a Lagrangian approach to the evaluation of 
electrostatic conductors undergoing deformation or shape changes. This approach enabled the 
surface charge densities on the deformed conductors to be computed without the requirement to 
 8
parallel-plate electrostatic actuator to a.c. signals with different bias voltages was measured using 
a laser interferometer [80]. Bourgeois et al. [81] developed an analytical model for the design of 
capacitive silicon accelerometers by minimizing the global energy of the elastic, inertial and 
electrostatic forces acting on the moving mass and the reacting dissipative forces in the gas. 
Yang et al. [82] proposed a methodology for extracting the macro-model parameters of the 
compressible isothermal squeezed-film damping for flexible MEMS structures undergoing small 
amplitudes of oscillation. A Green’s function method was presented to allow the resulting forces 
from the compressible squeeze-film damping to be calculated rapidly for any acoustic venting 
condition along the edges of a movable structure [83]. V. L. Rabinovich et al. [84] proposed a 
mod field effects induced by etch holes on the 
mech
uation in order to extend its application to the squeeze-film damping of 
perforated plates by adding a term relating to the damping effect of the gas flow through the hole. 
A novel approach combining the compressible Reynolds equation and the governing equation of 
plate deflection was proposed to model the behavior of flexible microstructures operating under 
the effects of squeeze-film damping [90]. 
el for evaluating the influence of the fringing 
anical properties of micro-actuator. A method for calculating the fluid dependent forces in 
movable micromechanical structures with nontrivial geometries was introduced by Mechner et al. 
[85]. Francais and Dufour [86] presented the simulation principles for a micro-pump taking the 
pull-in effect and the hysteresis phenomenon into consideration. Kim et al. [87] focused on the 
influence of the size and number of perforations on the squeeze film damping effect within 
microstructures. The vibrations of a micro-beam with one fixed end were investigated in order to 
explore the influence of the gap size on the damping effect [88]. In 2003, Bao et al. [89]

characteristics of the out-of-plane optical actuators of Al micro-beams were investigated as a 
function of the laser beam power, spot size, and modulation frequency [106]. Lin et al. [107] 
developed a method using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) mode synthesis to construct a 
macro-model for the dynamic simulation and analysis of a structurally complex MEMS device. 
A novel, low frequency measurement setup was presented to conduct the reliability and lifetime 
testing of capacitive RF MEMS switches [108].

The present study employs the Adomian decomposition method and the differential 
quadrature method (DQM) to overcome the difficulties inherent in the nonlinearly coupled 
equations relating the electrostatic force and the mechanical restoring force of microstructures.  
The decomposition method proposed by Adomian [109-111] has been widely used to solve 
both linear and nonlinear differential problems. A convenient and systematic formula was 
introduced by Rach [112] for evaluating the nonlinear Adomian polynomials. Further 
modification of the Adomian polynomials was provided by Adomian and Rac
ergence and generalization of the Adomian polynomials were addressed in several papers 
[114-115]. A comparison between the Adomian decomposition method and the Taylor series 
approximation revealed that the decomposition method was far more efficient than the Taylor 
series [116]. The decomposition method has been applied widely to the solution of different 
types of nonlinear problems, including nonlinear oscillatory problems [117-119] and inverse heat 
conduction problems [120]. A powerful modification of the Adomian decomposition method was 
proposed by Wazwaz [121] to accelerate its convergence to a solution. An efficient algorithm for 
 12
element method (DQEM) was also proposed for the solution of a vibrating beam resting on an 
elastic foundation [135]. 
In order to simplify the nonlinear equations and to minimize the effort involved in 
evaluating the Jacobian derivative matrix in the Newton-Raphson method, Chen et al. [136] 
proposed the Hadamard and SJT product approach. The modified differential quadrature method 
(MDQM) and the modified differential quadrature element method (MDQEM) were presented 
for structural analysis [137]. Recently, Liu and Wu [138-140] applied the GDQR to treat forced 
vibration problems in the spatial and time dimensions simultaneously, hence eliminating the 
requirement for the separate use of classical methods in the time dimension. Tanaka and Chen 
[141] proposed the use of the dual reciprocity BEM in space combined with the DQM in time for 
the numerical analysis of transient elastodynamic problems. Fung [142] investigated the stability 
and accuracy of the DQM when applied to the solution of dynamic problems under different 
sampling point methods. Shu et al. [143] considered time-dependent problems, and introduced 
an efficient method for their investigation involving marching in the time direction block by 
block and applying the DQM in each block to discretize both the spatial and temporal derivatives. 
An iterative method based on differential quadrature rules was proposed to simulate nonlinear 
coupled oscillators [144].

Chapter 2 Nonlinear Pull-in Effect of Electrostatic Micro-actuators  
This chapter investigates different types of rectangular beam micro-actuators, including the 
 actuator and the cantilever beam actuator. In establishing the nonlinear pull-in 
fect of electrostatic actuators, the Adomian decomposition method is employed to overcom
lated difficulties associated with the nonlinear equation of motion. This particular
position method is one of the most efficient techniques available for evaluating the 
unstable pull-in behavior of an electrostatic micro-actuator since solving the nonlinea
ation requires no iteration. The simulation model presented in this chapter considers th
icro-actuators with rectangular beams and deliberately excludes residual axial st

position dependent electrostatic pressure, ( , )eF x V , is created which pulls the deformable beam
toward the ground electrode. The electrostatic pressure is approximately proportional to the 
inverse of the square of the gap between the beam and the electrode. When the magnitude of the 
applied voltage exceeds the critical pull-in voltage of the device, the fixed-fixed beam w

 2.3.2 Simulation Model of Cantilever Beam Micro-actuator 
The nonlinear differential equation for a cantilever beam type micro-actuator can be derived 
from Eq. (2.3). As discussed by Legtenberg et al. [40], the rectangular polysilicon beam shown 
in Fig. 2-2 can be used in a cantilever micro-actuator. In the current example, the length of the 
beam is bL = 500 mµ , thand its ickness and width are 0h =1.6 mµ  and b =4.6 mµ , 
respectively. Furthermore, the maximum height of the actuator is s =32.2 mµ .  ensure a fair 
comparison with the published results [40], the following analyses ignore the electric fringing 
effect.

volta re ian decomposition method is reasonably close to the 
result of 112 volts calculated numerically by the energy model [40]. However, a significant 
discrepancy is noted between the current numerical result and the experimental value of 223 V. 
The reason for this difference may arise from the deliberate exclusion of electrical field fringing 
ects at the f ee end of the cantile ice, the electrostatic field between the beam and 
the electrode is not distributed uniformly. Since the gap between the beam and the electrode is

3.2 Analysis Model of Nonlinear Pull-in Deflection 
The electrostatic force generated when a driving voltage is applied between the beam and 
the electrode causes a deflection of the cantilever beam. Generally, the electrostatic force is 
approximately proportional to the inverse of the square of the gap between the beam and the 
electrode. For simplicity, this chapter assumes a parallel-plate approximation [39]. When the 
voltage exceeds a certain critical voltage, the cantilever beam will be pulled suddenly into the 
electrode. In evaluating the nonlinear large deflection term and the boundary conditions effects 
in the deflection equation, this chapter considers two models for the cantilever actuator beam and 
one m

ides a simple and effective means to handle the nonlinear differential equations associated 
with the DQM. The advantage of the Hadamard product lies in its explicit matrix form and in its 
easily programmable expressions. The formulation of the Hadamard product is straightforward, 
particularly when compared to the traditional DQM polynomial approximation expressions. 
The Hadamard product and the SJT product are defined as follows.

The Newton-Raphson method is a fundamental numerical technique for
n ions of ear differential quation set resulting from the DQM for
proposed the post-m trix and vector.  
The SJT product enables the analytical solution of the Frechet derivative matrix to be 
obtained. The computation effort required for one SJT product sim ly involves an

This chapter investigates shaped cantilever beam type micro-tweezers and considers the 
 In order to investigate the feasibility and 
to the nonlinear deflection equation of the 
icro-tweezers problem, the DQM is initially applied to simulate the rectangular beam type of 
i ntal 
e available literature. To evaluate the operational range of micro-tweezers, 
 type micro-tweezers are studied and analyzed in an attempt 
to extend their operating range.  
 
4.1 Models of Micro-tweezers 
 
4.1.1 Analysis Model 
Figure 4-1 shows a schematic illustration of the cantilever beam type micro-tweezer 
comprising two individual micro-beams. The application of an external voltage, V , between 
these two deformable beams establishes a position dependent electrostatic pressure, ( , )eF x V , 
which pulls the two b . The electrostatic pressure is approximately 
proportional to the inverse of the square of the gap between them, and hence a parallel-plate 
approximation can be applied. When the applied voltage exceeds a critical pull-in voltage, the 
two cantilever beams are pulled suddenly together. 
As shown in Fig.4-1, the nonlinear differential equations for a shaped cantilever beam type 
icro-tweezer can be expressed as [39,40]:

beam width is b =2.7 mµ . Furthermore, the thickness of the rectangular beam is 0h =2.9 mµ  
and the initial gap is 0 0d 2g 4 mµ= = . Table 4-1 summarizes the details of the beam geometry. 
Fig. 4-2 indicates that the gap between the two cantilever beams reduces gradually as the applied 
voltage is increased toward a critical voltage. Beyond this critical voltage, the two ca
beams are pulled sudd . It can be seen that a good agreement exists 
betw  the proposed DQM and the pull-in voltage of 
78 V reported by Shi et al. in 1995 using the hybrid FEM-BED method [11]. The difference 
between the two sets of results is found to be less than 2%.

assumption is made that the micro-tweezer arms are symmetr
along the centerline of the gap between the two arms.  
This study uses a simple spring at the free end of the micro-beam to model the effect of the 
two arm tips contacting the gripped object. Hence, when the tips are in contact with the object, 
the beam is no longer cantilevered, but is considered to be spring-supported at the tip. This

DQM for different numbers of selected sampling points is shown in Fig. 4-7. As discussed 
previously, the locations of the sampling points along the beam are selected in accordance with

The comparisons presented above for the rectangular cantilever beam type micro-tweezers

4.2.2 Shaped Cantilever Beam Micro-tweezers  
In this section, the beam length, width and material properties are the same as those 
presented previously in Section 4.2.1.3. However, the shape of the beam thickness profile is 
different. As shown in Fig. 4-1, the beam thickness, h , has a shape order of m  and the 
thickness at the two ends is given by ,x 0 1= . Table 4-2 summarizes the dimensions of this 
 74
electrostatic micro-tweezers. 
 Using shaped beam micro-tweezers can reduce the critical pull-in voltage from 141 V 
(rectangular beam) to 87 volts ( m 2= , .1h 0 3 mµ= ).

The residual axial stress influences the natural frequencies of the electrostatically actuated 
micro-beam. Fig. 5-3 displays the variation in the lowest four natural frequencies with different 
residual forces, bT , and actuating voltages. The beam length is 210 mµ  in each case. The 
remaining beam parameters are listed in Table 5-1. It is observed that the natural frequencies 
increase with residual axial stress. As noted in [68], the natural frequency only reduces 
significantly for the lowest natural frequency, 1ω , when the actuating voltage, V, increases. The 
higher natural frequencies do not display any significant variation  
Fig. 5-4 displays the variation in the four natural frequencies of the 210 mµ  micro-beam 
for different gap sizes and actuating voltages. As in [68], Fig. 5-4 utilizes a dimensionless gap 
parameter of ( )20 06 g hγ = . The results reveal that the first fundamental frequency, 1ω , is the 
most sensitive to the gap distance and actuating voltage. Specifically, a smaller gap size results in 
a smaller pull-in voltage for the first natural frequency. For the second natural frequency, 2ω , 
the pull-in effect is only observed at .1 0γ =  and .3 7γ = . By contrast, no obvious pull-in 
effect can be observed for the third or fourth natural frequencies.

6.1 Model Description 
6.1.1 Governing Equation of a Cantilever Micro-beam Type Actuator 
 Consider the cantilever beam type micro-actuator with a gate electrode shown in Fig. 
6-1. The dynamic deflection, ( , )y x t , of the cantilever micro-beam with a parallel-plate 
electrostatic load induced by a step voltage, V , [78,105] (Hosaka et al., 1995 and McCarthy 
et al., 2002) is given by the following nonlinear differential equation:

where ( , )y x t  is the downward deflection of the micro-beam, pC  is the force per unit length 
provided by the squeeze-film damping pressure between the electrode and the micro-beam, 
and Aρ  is equal to the mass per unit length of the micro-beam. The definitions of the 
remaining parameters are as provided previously.  
It is considered that the electrostatic force acts only on the micro-beam in the region 
directly above the gate. Hence, the electrostatic forces at different positions can be 
approximated as follows [105]:

If Eq. (6.3) is substituted into Eq. (6.2), and it is assumed that aρ  and µ  are constant 
throughout the fluid and are independent of z , then integrating across the width of the 
micro-beam yields:

Although this equation is nonlinear in g , for a specified g , Eq. (6.4) is linear in ( )P x . 
Before the pressure in Eq. (6.4) can be substituted into Eq. (6.1), it most first be converted to 
the force per unit beam length pC  in Eq. (6.1). This conversion is obtained by integrating 
( , )
µ∂ ∂+ − =       (6.4) 
p x z  in Eq. (6.3) across the beam width to give: 
( )p

Hence, the current analytical methodology involves an iterative calculation between Eqs. 
(6.1)
ain the dynam c gap at each time instant. 
If the beam length is much greater than its width, then a narrow-bearing approximation 
e beam length direction can be neglected. The 
original initial gap, 0g , is further assumed to be uniform and the vibration amplitude is taken 
to be f r smaller than 0g . Hence, Eq. (6.2) can be sim lified as [78]: 
 and (6.4), i.e. the damping pressure can be calculated for the initial gap by using Eq. 
(6.4). The solution of Eq. (6.4) is then substituted into Eq. (6.1), and the equation of motion 
calculated (6.1) in order to obtain the dynamic gap at the next time step. This gap size is then 
substituted into Eq. (6.4) as before and the damping pressure calculation performed. This 
iterative procedure is repeated step by step to obt i

rectangular beam ( )0 1h h 2 mµ= = is also provided for reference purposes. The settle time for 
the uniform rectangular micro-beam is seen to be approximately 60 microseconds after four 
oscillatory bounces. 
As the tip thickness of the beam is first reduced to .1h 1 75 mµ=  and then subsequently 
 120
reduced to 26 microseconds without even a single oscillatory bounce. 
 
6.3.4.3 Residual Vibration of a Shaped Beam with a Shape Parameter of m=2.0 
This section considers the case of different 2  order polynomial shaped micro-beams 
with a partial electrode design. The responses of these micro-beam systems are shown in Fig. 
6-6. The settle times of the micro-beams with tip thicknesses of .1h 1 75 m
nd
µ=  and 
.1h 1 5 mµ=  are found to be 55 and 50 microseconds, respectively, following three oscillatory 
bounces. Reducing the tip thickness to .1h 1 25 mµ=  suppresses the residual vibration such 
that the settle time 5 microseconds following two oscillatory bounces. Similarly, when the 
tip thickness is .1h 1 0 m
 is 4
µ= , the settle time is approximately 42 microseconds after a single 
bounce. Finally, if the tip thickness of the shaped beam is further reduced to .1h 0 9434 mµ= , 
 of the mi icroseconds without a single bounce. 
emarks 
conclusions can be drawn: 
Wi
the settle time cro-beam is 25 m

 Residual vibration of the micro-switch with a squeeze-film damping force will reduce 
the lifetime of the micro-actuator. This study has investigated various shaped 
micro-beams with partial electrodes and has identified the geometric parameters 
which successfully suppress residual vibration. 
 
7.2 Future Research 
Based on the excellent accuracy of the results presented in this study, the proposed 
analysis methodology can be used to study the following areas in the future. 
 The further study of shaped beams and curved electrodes with the intention of 
further enhancing the performance of micro-actuators. 
 The proposed simulation method can also be applied in the study of rotational type 
micro-actuators. 
 Regarding the design of the micro-actuator, the performance and lifetime of the 
device under different environmental conditions are very important considerations. 
Hence, the response of micro-actuators under different environ ental excitation 
loads is a necessary future research initiative.
