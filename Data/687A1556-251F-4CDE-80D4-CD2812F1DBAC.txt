I. 前言  Introduction 
In sports medicine, the knee ligaments are some of the most common injury sites.  Ligaments are bands of 
parallel dense connective tissue, made of collagen fibers (mostly type I), that mediate normal joint movement 
and stability.  Ligament injuries, called sprains, happen mostly to the medial collateral and anterior cruciate 
ligaments of the knee (MCL and ACL).  While MCL exhibits reliable healing even without treatment, ACL 
uniformly fails to mount a healing response, even if repair is attempted [1-2].  A novel treatment option, 
called enhanced primary repair, places a provisional matrix at the tear site to promote cell infiltration of the 
wound and aims to reestablish the structure-function relationship of the ACL [3].  This approach of guided 
tissue regeneration offers potential benefits of retaining the complex native tissue matrix structure, innervation, 
and vascularization as compared with grafts.  A major aspect of this procedure is enhancing ligament 
fibroblast infiltration into the matrix material and promoting matrix synthesis.  We previously demonstrated 
that applied electric fields (EFs) enhance knee ligament fibroblast migration, alignment, and collagen gene 
expressions on pl anar substrates [4].  In our previous projects funded by the NSC, ligament fibroblasts 
exhibited enhanced and directed migration on native ligament matrices in applied EFs.  Based on t hese 
results, we proposed to establish an in vitro explant model to investigate the effects of applied DC EF on 
fibroblast migration from the ligament explant into a 3D collagen material.  
 
II. 研究目的  Specific Aims 
Our hypothesis was that applied DC EF can improve ligament explant integration with collagen hydrogel in 
vitro by enhancing cell infiltration, alignment, matrix production and fiber organization, and hence improving 
the mechanical strength at the repair site.  Based on this overarching hypothesis, we proposed the following 
specific aims (SA): 
 
SA1 Establish ligament explant cultures with hydrogel as an interfacing material at the wound site.  
Design and manufacture electrical stimulation chamber suitable for long term 3D EF 
application. 
SA2  Characterize the effects of applied constant DC EF on ligament fibroblast migration into the 
hydrogel and subsequent cell and fiber organization.  Examine collagen production, cell 
proliferation, fiber alignment, and mechanical properties (tensile modulus and ultimate tensile 
strength) in EF stimulated constructs. 
SA3  Optimize ligament fibroblast response in applied DC EF with addition of growth factors or 
modifying EF application parameters.  TGF-β1, PDGF-AB, FGF-2, and GDF-5 are candidate 
growth factors known to affect ligament fibroblasts.  Periodic monophasic EFs that is often 
used in physical therapy will also be applied at frequencies from 0.01 to 10 Hz and amplitudes 
from 0.1 to 10 V/cm.   
 
III. 文獻探討  Background 
A Electric Fields 
EFs can play a significant role in modulating cellular behaviors.  An electrical gradient of 1-5 V/cm has been 
found in embryonic tissue and wound sites to promote cell migration [5-7].  In cultured cells, it is  
hypothesized that the electric fields creates an electro-osmosis force to recruit membrane proteins to polarize, 
3 
 
The explants and constructs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). 
Constructs were placed in a customized EF chamber (
EF Stimulation 
Figure IV-1A).  Briefly, the customized chamber was 
housed in a petri dish with PDMS supports on either side to create a rectangle chamber.  Agarose salt bridges 
completed the circuit from the power supply (Keithley SourceMeter) via Ag-AgCl electrodes to the chamber.  
Constructs were subjected to 1 hour of applied EF at 0.1 V/cm everyday for 5 days followed by 2 days of rest.  
Control constructs were placed in the chamber without the application of EF.  
A.2 Results 
Figure IV-1B illustrates ACL fibroblast outgrowth from the explant into the provisional collagen gel matrix.  
Quantification of the images revealed a significant increase of cell number in the provisional matrix with time 
(Figure IV-1C).  No difference was found between the control and electrical stimulation groups in terms of 
cell number, which was confirmed by the DNA quantification results on day 7 (1.88 ± 1.31 µg/g of collagen 
gel for the control group, 1.15 ± 0.24 µg/g for the EF group, p=0.35, n=4).  No difference was found in cell 
density between the regions closer to the cathode or anode.  Longer studies of 2 weeks failed to reveal the 
ultimate increase in cell infiltration (data not shown). 
 
A.3 Discussion  
A model system was developed to simulate ligament fibroblast infiltration into the provisional matrix.  This 
system allows for real-time optical monitoring as well as application of various physical and chemical factors.  
Furthermore, in addition to collagen gel matrix, other provisional matrix materials such as fibrin or Matrigel 
can be easily incorporated into the system.  In the current study, a high density collagen hydrogel was used to 
examine the effects of applied EF on cell outgrowth.  No significant differences in cell density were found 
within the one-week experimental period.

B.1 Introduction 
Ligament fibroblasts reside in a highly fibrous and anisotropic microenvironment.  The type I collagen that 
made up the majority of the ligament extracellular matrix are organized into fiber bundles and crimp

cell migration, the tensional balance achieved by forward and backward forces determines cell migration 
speed and directionality [37].  In the current study, substrate thickness, and the resulting effective stiffness, 
modulates EF-induced directional migration in 3D. Interestingly, the same phenomenon was not found in 2D 
studies (data not shown).  F urthermore, we found different actin-microtubule interactions in the two 
substrates, which were influenced by the ROCK inhibitor (Figure IV-4).  While less understood than the 
individual filament systems, interactions between actin and microtubule is fundamental for cell polarization 
[38].  Future studies will investigate the signaling mechanisms of mechanosensing and actin-microtubule 
interactions. 
 
V. 計畫成果 
While the original proposal was for 2 years, in the significantly reduced budget and allotted time (one year), 
we have achieved more than half of the proposed goals.  We aimed in the first phase of the project, to 
establish ligament explant cultures as well as a long-term electrical stimulation device.  As illustrated in 
Section IVA , we successfully established the explant culture system with capabilities of applying electrical 
stimulations.  Additionally, we proposed to investigate the effects of long-term electrical stimulation on 
ligament fibroblast infiltration into the provisional matrix.  No differences were found for the two week 
studies.  As the original project intended to conduct longer-term cultures of the aforementioned systems, 
time restraints have only allowed us to begin such experiments and are currently ongoing.  In the mean time, 
we explored the effects of collagen fiber organization and structure on ligament fibroblast migration in 3D 
gels.  We found that collagen gel size, and the corresponding effective material stiffness, modulates cell 
directionality as well as cytoskeletal organization (Section IVB), which is mediated through RhoA signaling.  
We also found that applied EFs polarize α2β1 integrins at the cell surface, which in turn activates RhoA 
signaling to promote directed migration in ligament fibroblasts (see Appendix).  Results of these researches 
have been accepted for presentations at the prestigious 2012 annual Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) 
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, on February 4th, 2011.  ORS is the premiere conference for orthopaedics 
related research with low abstract acceptance rates.  These publications are appended.  We are also in the 
process of preparing manuscripts for full-length article submissions.  In addition to the ongoing manuscript 
preparations, we have obtained further funding based on these results from the NSC to further examine the 
effects of 3D matrix structure on tissue development and morphogenesis.  These investigations will provide 
insights into the EF-induced cell behaviors in a native 3D microenvironment and mechanisms behind cell 
mobility.  M oreover, these findings will aid in design and modification of medical devices that can promote 
soft tissue repair via electrical stimulation.

Figure 2 illustrates ACL fibroblast outgrowth from the explant into the 
provisional collagen gel matrix.  Quantification of the images revealed 
a significant increase of cell number in the provisional matrix with 
time (Figure 3).  No difference was found between the control and 
electrical stimulation groups in terms of cell number, which was 
confirmed by the DNA quantification results on day 7 (1.88 ± 1.31  
g/g of collagen gel for the control group, 1.15 ± 0.24 g/g for the EF 
group, p=0.35, n=4).  No difference was found in cell density between 
the regions closer to the cathode or anode (data not shown).  
Interestingly, when the rate of infiltration was calculated from the data 
presented in Figure 3, a significant increase was found in the EF group 
by day 5, suggesting a delayed migration response to electrical 
stimulation (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION  
A model system was developed to simulate ligament fibroblast 
infiltration into the provisional matrix.  This system allows for real-
time optical monitoring as well as application of various physical and 
chemical factors.  Furthermore, in addition to collagen gel matrix, 
other provisional matrix materials such as fibrin or Matrigel can be 
easily incorporated into the system.  In the current study, a high 
density collagen hydrogel was used to examine the effects of applied 
EF on cell outgrowth.  While no significant differences in cell density 
were found within the one-week experimental period, the increase of 
cell infiltration rate after 5 days of electrical stimulation suggests a 
delayed response in cell outgrowth and future studies will examine the 
long-term effects of the applied EF.  In addition, numerous electrical 
stimulation parameters have been utilized to stimulate cell migration 
and wound healing [2, 4].  At higher field strengths (10 V/cm), Sun 
and coworkers found mesenchymal stem cell alignment in applied EFs, 
which also resulted in collagen matrix reorientation [5].  We also 
recently reported ligament fibroblast cell migration and orientation 
enhancement in 3D aligned collagen matrix with applied EF [6].  
While no particular cell orientation was found in the current report, 
future studies will systematically investigate the effects of EF dose 
response, waveforms, and provisional matrix composition and 
structure on ligament fibroblast migration in 3D.

INTRODUCTION  Guided cell migration has important implications in 
tissue development, repair, and engineering.  We have previously 
demonstrated that ligament fibroblast migration is differentially 
modulated by applied electric fields (EFs) in a number of physical 
therapy treatment modalities [1].  Using different waveform and field 
strengths, we discovered a decoupling of cell shape and directionality, 
which suggests disparate mechanisms [1-2].  In the current study, we 
examined the mechanisms behind the distinctive responses.  Integrin, a 
major extracellular matrix receptor, has been proposed to contribute to 
EF-induced directed migration [3-6].  We demonstrated the involvement 
of integrin polarization on EF-induced cell directionality and signaling. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE   EF-induced directed migration plays an important 
role in development and wound healing [7-8].  Understanding of EF-
induced directionality can provide insight into morphogenesis and 
optimize parameters to promote wound healing. 
 
METHODS AND MATERIALS  Cell Culture: Anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) fibroblasts were harvested from explant cultures.  The 
explant and cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS 
(Invitrogen).  Prior to experiments, the ACL fibroblasts were seeded on 
glass slides at 2x105 cells/cm2 for 2 hours.  Pharmacological treatments 
included cholesteryl hemisuccinate (Sigma) at 1 mM for 30 minutes, 
anti-α2β1 integrin antibody (Chemicon) at 2.8 µg/mL for 30 minutes, 
and C3 transferase (Cytoskeleton) at 100 µg/mL for 2 hours.  EF 
Stimulation: A customized electrical stimulation chamber as used as 
previously described [9].  Constant direct current (DC) EF was applied 
at 6 V/cm across the chamber using a Keithley SourceMeter.  The 
sinusoidal waveform (sine) was applied using a custom stimulator 
(Dynaprog, MingQuo, Taiwan), with a peak intensity of 1.2 V at 50 Hz.  
Cell Migration Analysis: Images were taken every 15 minutes during the 
one-hour stimulation and cell migration speed and directionality were 
analyzed from the displacement of the centroid locations of each cell.  
Directional velocity represents cell migration speed in the direction of 
EF.  Immunohistochemistry: Upon completion of EF, cells were fixed 
with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated overnight with the primary 
antibodies (anti-α2β1 integrin and anti-RhoA, Cytoskeleton).  FITC-
conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon) was used for detection. An 
confocal microscope (Olympus) was used to visualize the fluorescent 
signals.  To quantify distribution, each cell was divided into four equal 
quadrants and Image J was used to measure the fluorescence intensity in 
each region.  Asymmetry index (AI) was calculated by subtracting the 
normalized intensity of the region facing cathode from the region facing 
anode, and normalized to the overall average intensity of the cell [10], 
where a positive value indicates cathodal distribution.  Statistics: 
Statistical analysis were performed using Statistica (Fisher’s LSD, 
α=0.05, StatSoft). 
 
RESULTS  Applied EFs enhance ACL fibroblast migration, while DC 
and sinusoidal waves promoted opposite directionality (Fig 1, [1]).  α2β1 
integrin labeling revealed a cathodal accumulation in the DC treated 
cells and anodal accumulation in the sinusoidal waveforms, as evidenced 
with AI, corresponding with the migration direction (Fig 2).  In short 
term studies, integrin redistribution started as early as 5 minutes in DC 
EF (Fig 2A).  Decreasing the membrane diffusivity with cholesterol 
decreased the cell directionality as well as integrin redistribution. 
Specific inhibition of the α2β1 integrin by incubating with the antibody 
also abolished migration directionality without affecting motility (Fig 1).  
Interestingly, integrin still redistributed as in the control group (Fig 2).  
RhoA staining revealed a lack of RhoA redistribution with functional 
blocking of integrins, suggesting inhibited intracellular polarization (Fig 
3A) [11-12].  Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA activation had a similar 
effect on cell migration in applied EF with integrin blocking (Fig 3B). 
 
DISCUSSION  Polarization is essential in directed cell migration.  A 
number of mechanisms have been proposed to mediate EF-induced 
directionality in several cell types [13]. Electro-osmosis of cell surface 
proteins such as integrin and EGF receptor is one of the proposed 
sensing mechanisms [4, 14].  In the current study, we report on the 
involvement of α2β1 integrin mediated RhoA polarization in EF-induced 
migration.  α2β1 integrin specifically binds to the main ligament matrix 
component, type I collagen, and α2 integrin has been shown to modulate 
ligament fibroblast migration [15].  By functionally blocking α2β1 
integrin with its antibody, we inhibited directionality without changing 
motility.  This response coincides with the lack of RhoA polarization 
(Fig 3A).  Inhibition of RhoA also abolishes EF-induced directionality 
(Fig 3B).  RhoA regulates membrane protrusion at the leading edge and 
localized RhoA activation can be an important mediator of cell 
polarization [16].  Future studies will investigate integrin and RhoA 
activation as well as the intermediating signaling events.
