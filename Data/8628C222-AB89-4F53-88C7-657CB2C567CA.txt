Abstract: 
As the rapid development of 
information technologies, the transmission 
contents over the Internet change from pure 
text to multimedia data, including VoIP and 
video. The integrating need of multimedia 
application and network communication 
services has become the guide of the future 
technology developments. However, the 
existing Internet architecture and the 
emerging wireless Internet still has some 
improvement space considering the 
transmitting speed, quality of service, and 
security. Supporting Quality-of-Service 
based scheduling scheme similar to the 
coordinated distributed scheduling as 
defined in [1]. We assume all SSs are 
equipped with omni-directional antennas, 
use single channel, and all SSs transmit at 
the same power level. 
 
2.1.2.1 The Network Model 
In a WMN, a condition must be 
satisfied for a successful wireless 
transmission. It’s that the signal to 
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at 
receiver must be no smaller than its capture 
threshold denoted as CPThresh. This is 
referred to as the capture threshold 
constraint. 
For the wireless communications, the 
physical interference model and the spectral 
efficiency (the sustainable transmission rate 
per Hz bandwidth) model similar to those 
proposed in [2][3][4][5] are assumed. Under 
the physical model, the signal quality 
(SINR) of a TX/RX pair is given as follows:

where PTX is the transmitter power of

stations TX and RX, and α  is the 
path-loss exponent which is a parameter of 
the environmental condition of the deployed 
WMN. Its typical range is between 2.0 to 
6.0 [6]. PIFi is the transmitter power of 
transmitter IFi, dIFi<->Non_Intended_RX is the 
distance between the interfering transmitter 
and the non-intended receiver, and |I| is the 
number of the other concurrent 
transmissions in the same slot. 
 
2.1.2.2 Network Utilization – Transmission 
Concurrency and Spectral Efficiency 
To maximize the network capacity 
throughput, an effective approach is to 
exploit spatial channel reuse and obtain the 
maximal number of concurrent 
transmissions at each time slot. 
Let ρ represent the network utilization 
which is defined as the ratio of the total 
transmission pairs scheduled to the 
maximum number of possible transmission 
pairs in a data time slot in the wireless mesh 
network.  
∑=

Let Tnet(l) represent the network 
capacity throughput at time slot l which is 
the sum of the individual link rate (or the 
transmission spectral efficiency) that are 
scheduled to transmit in the slot, i.e.

There is a tradeoff between the 
transmission spectral efficiency employed 
by individual links and the number of 
concurrently schedulable (successful) 
transmission pairs. Basically, to allow more 
number of schedulable concurrent 
transmissions, one would need to reduce 
individual transmission’s spectral efficiency. 
On the other hand, if a transmitter increases 
its transmission spectral efficiency, the total 
number of schedulable concurrent 
transmission pairs must be limited to avoid 
unnecessary interference.  
In this work, we propose Tier-k 
their transmission does not affect this 
transmit/receive pair. Likewise, for every 
SS scheduled to receive on a data slot, all its 
tier-1 neighbors, except for the target 
transmitter, are prohibited from transmit 
simultaneously. Figure 1(a) shows an 
example of tier-0 clean-air policy in which 
all SSs are either transmitting or receiving. 
Hence, this transmission pattern has 100% 
network utilization. Figure 1(b) and 1(c) 
depict two example transmission patterns of 
the tier-1 and tier-2 clean-air conditions, 
achieving 50% (i.e. one half of the total SSs 
are either transmitting or receiving) and 
33% network utilization, respectively. 
 
2.1.2.4 Schedulers that implement “Tier-k 
Clean-Air Policy” with given network 
utilization ρ 
Given a target ρ in a data slot and the 
tier-k clean-air policy, next step we will find 
an algorithm that can generate an 
appropriate control/data subframe access 
schedule and appropriate spectral 
efficiencies of every transmission that 
meets the target ρ while satisfying the tier-k 
clean-air spatial reuse condition. Different 
policies are with different network 
utilization and degree of interference. We 
explore the network capacity throughput 
that can be achieved by tier-0/tier-1/tier-2 
policies. To evaluate the performance, first 
we will assume regular hexagonal topology 
of the WMN with always backlogged SSs 
to explore which policy gives the maximum 
network capacity throughput. Second we 
examine the impact of realistic deployment 
scenario by introducing random 
perturbations to mesh SSs. Third, instead of 
assuming all SSs are backlogged, we 
randomly add traffic to different pairs of 
stations to explore which policy gives the 
maximum network capacity throughput. 
 
2.2 子計畫二：下一代多層級多媒體服務
匯流網路之疊加層網路關鍵技術 
2.2.1 研究目標 
The design of search algorithms is 
critical to the performance of unstructured 
peer-to-peer (P2P) networks [7].  In the 
unstructured P2P networks, each node does 
not have the global information about the 
whole topology and the location of queried 
resources.  Because of the dynamic nature 
of unstructured P2P networks, it is also 
difficult to correctly capture the global 
behavior [8] [9].  Therefore, it depends on 
the search algorithms to help locating the 
queried resource and routing the message to 
the target node. 
Previous works about the search issue 
in unstructured P2P networks can be 
classified into two categories: breadth first 
search (BFS)-based methods, and depth first 
search (DFS)-based methods.  These two 
types of search algorithms tend to be 
inefficient, either generating too much load 
on the system [10][11], or not meeting 
users’ requirements[12]. 
In this project we propose the dynamic 
search algorithm (DS) which is a 
generalization of flooding and RW.  DS 
overcomes the disadvantages of flooding 
and RW, and takes advantage of different 
contexts under which each search algorithm 
performs well.  The operation of DS 
applying APS search builds a probability 
table for each neighbor and each object.  It 
consistently refines its probability table by 
the search experiences.  If a search query 
for some object delivers to certain neighbor 
successfully, the probability entry 
corresponding to that neighbor and object is 
increased.  If the search fails finally, it will 
decrease the probability entry.  In 
accordance with APS, when a certain node 
receives a hit from peer i, it adds 10 points 
for the entry of peer i; if peer i fails to 
respond the hit to that node, the node 
subtracts 10 points for the entry of peer i. 
Fig. 2 shows an example of 
knowledge-based DS algorithm. Node A 
initializes a search for a certain object.  It 
makes its forwarding decision of which 
neighbors should be sent to in accordance 
with the probability table shown in TABLE 
1.  Assume the messages are sent to node 
B, C, F.  When node B receives the 
message, it checks its probability table 
shown in TABLE 1 and generates another 
two query messages to node I and G. 
We apply Newman’s random graph as 
the network topology, adopt the generation 
functions to model the link degree 
distribution [13], and analyze DS based on 
some performance metrics, including the 
success rate, search time, query hits, query 
messages, query efficiency, and search 
efficiency.  The analysis by generating 
functions talks about a graph all of whose 
parameters are exactly what they should be 
on an average random graph. 
 
2.2.2.3 Performance Metrics 
Success rate ( SR ) is the probability 
that the query is success, i.e., there is at 
least one query hit.  Assume that the 
queried resources are uniformly distributed 
in the network with a replication ratio R  of 
the queried object, and then SR  can be 
calculated as 
( )1- 1- CSR R=  
where R  is the replication ratio and C  is 
the coverage. 
To represent the capability of one 
search algorithm to find the queried 
resource in time with a given probability, 
we define the search time ( ST ) as the search 
time it takes to guarantee the query success 
with success rate requirement reqSR .  ST  
represents the hop count that a search is 
successful with a probabilistic guarantee. 
ST  for DS is

idling, leaving, and joining again to form a 
cycle.  The joining and leaving operations 
of peers (include idling) are inferred and 
then modeled by the uptime and session 
duration distributions measured in [16] and 
[17].  These measurement studies show 
similar results in the peer uptime 
distribution, where half of the peers have 
uptime percentage less than 10% and the 
best 20% of peers have 45% uptime or more.  
We use the log-quadratic distribution 
suggested in [17] to re-build the uptime 
distribution, which is plotted in Figure 4.  
But for the session duration distribution, 
those two studies lead to different results.  
The median of session time in [17] is about 
15 minutes while it is 60 minutes in [16].  
In our modeling, we choose the median 
session duration time to be 20 minutes. 
By these two rebuilt distributions, we 
can generate a probability model to decide 
when a peer should join or leave the 
network and how long it should continually 
be online.  The basic rule to assign peers’ 
attributes is that peers with higher link 
degrees are assigned to higher uptime 
percentages and longer session durations, 
and vice versa.  With these conditions, we 
map a two-hour long dynamic join/leave 
pattern for peers.  On average, there are 10 
peers joining or leaving simultaneously.  
Since the mean value of uptime distribution 
is about 18%, the resulting average number 
of online peers is 18,152.  Moreover, the 
maximum number of online nodes is 24,218 
while the minimum number is 4,886. 
We model the dynamic querying model 
as Poisson distribution with idle time λ= 50 
minutes; that is, each peer will initiate a 
search every 50 minutes on average.  Since 
there is no direct measurement about the 
idle time, we just use an experiential value.  
The choice of this parameter is insensitive 
to our search performance evaluation.   
With the idle time 50 minutes, there are thus 
about 6 queries or searches processing 
concurrently in the network on average.  
Totally, in this 2-hour simulation, we 
generate 43,632 search queries.  
Furthermore, for the query distribution of 
search objects, we model it as zipf 
distribution with parameter a = 0.82.  
Finally, our simulator’s central clock is 
triggered per second, which measures a hop 
for messaging passing and serves as a basic 
time unit for all peer operations.

2.2.3.1 Effects of Parameters n and p of DS 
Fig. 4 illustrates that how the decision 
threshold n  of DS would affect the system 
performance.  Due to the page limit, we 
only show the result when p  is set as 1.  
The case of 1n =  is analogue to RW search 
with K  equal to the number of the first 
Fig. 4. SE  vs. hop count when p  is set as 1 and 
n  is changed from 1 to 7.  Power-law topology 
with 10000N = .  When n  is set as 2, DS gets 
the best performance for almost all hop counts. 
Similar results can be obtained when the 
parameters are set as other values.  The 
numbers of walkers K  for RW are set as 1 
and 32.  The decision thresholds n  are set 
as 2, 3 and 7, and p  is set as 1.  TTL  is 
set as 7 in this case, thus DS with 7n =  is 
equal to flooding.  From Fig. 7 DS with 
large n  always gets the short ST  because 
it always covers more vertices.  On the 
contrary, RW with 1K =  always gets the 
longest ST  since its coverage is only 
incremental by one at each hop.  When K  
is set as 32, its coverage is enlarged and ST  
can be improved.  However, DS still 
performs better than RW with 32 walkers 
even when n  is set as only 2.  Note that 
when n  is set as 3, DS performs as well as 
that with 7n = , i.e., flooding, while does 
not generate as many query messages.  In 
summary, DS with 2n =  and 1p =  would 
get the best SE  and significantly improve 
ST  in this case.  While increasing n  to 3, 
although SE  is a little degraded, the 
shortest ST  is obtained. 
 
2.2.3.3 Performance of Knowledge-based 
Dynamic Search 
The experimental results for different 
search algorithms with knowledge building 
mechanism are shown in Fig. 8.  With APS 
knowledge building mechanism, all search 
algorithms perform much better than they 
do without knowledge.  Comparing these 
three search algorithms, for the case at 
7h = , SE  of DS is 24% better than that of 
RW, and 31 times better than that of MBFS. 
The outstanding performance results from 
the good tradeoff between the search 
performance and the cost. 
2.2.3.4 Conclusion 
In this project we propose DS 
algorithm which is a generalization of 
flooding, MBFS, and RW.  DS algorithm 
overcomes the disadvantages of flooding 
and RW, and takes advantage of various 
contexts under which each search algorithm 
performs well.  The operation of DS 
resembles flooding or MBFS for the 
short-term search, and RW for the 
long-term search. 
We analyze the performance of DS 
based on some metrics including the 
success rate, search time, number of query 
hits, number of query messages, query 
efficiency, and search efficiency.  
Numerical results show that proper setting 
of the parameters of DS can obtain the short 
search time and provide a good tradeoff 
between the search performance and the 
cost.  Under different contexts such as the 
number of peers in the network and the 
replication ratio of interested objects, the 
proposed DS algorithm always performs 
well.  When combined with the 
knowledge-based search algorithms, the 
performance could be further improved.

with the knowledge-based search mechanisms.  
DS always performs the best. 
We assume that the customer arrival 
processes of the MVNOs are all Poisson but 
the arrival rates could change across 
different intervals. The arrival rates during 
Ij are denoted by λj = [λj1, λj2,…, λjN]. The 
service time distributions are assumed 
general but do not change with time. Bi(t) 
denotes the CDF of the service time of 
MVNO-i and 1/μi is its average service time. 
sj = [sj1, sj2,…, sjN] denotes the system state 
at the beginning of interval Ij and sji is the 
number of customers in MVNO-i at jT. The 
cost vector which WBP charges the 
MVNOs per customer per second can also 
vary across time intervals and is denoted by 
cj = [cj1, cj1,…, cjN]. 
The bandwidth allocation during Ij is bj 
= [bj1, bj1,…, bjN] and the total bandwidth W 
of the WBP should not be exceeded, i.e. 
1
,N jii b W j= ≤ ∀∑ . Once the WBP determines 
bj at jT, it enforces new upper bounds to the 
number of customers of the MVNOs. This 
mechanism might incur some dropping of 
the customers. In compensation, the WBP 
should pay di to MVNO-i for each customer 
dropping event. 
 
2.3.2.2 Estimate of the Income 
According to the system model, we 
could model the behavior of each MVNO 
with an M/G/c/c queue with variable arrival 
rate. However, it is difficult to derive the 
transcient distribution of the number of 
customers in an M/G/c/c queue as the 
arrival rate changes. Therefore, in order to 
estimate the income of MVNO-i during 
interval Ij, we first derive the transcient 
behavior of an M/G/∞ system. Afterwards, 
we truncate the probability mass function 
(PMF) of the M/G/∞ queue so that its 
maximum system size equals the capacity 
limit of the MVNO, and use the result as an 
approximate transcient distribution of the 
M/G/c/c queue. 
We assume that Xji(t) is the number of 
MVNO-i's customers who entered the 
system during (jT, jT+t] and are still in the 
system at jT+t, and Yji(t) is the number of 
MVNO-i's customers who were in the 
system at jT and remain in the system at 
jT+t. Consequently, we have Xji (0) = 0 and 
Yji (0) = sji. For t > 0, Xji(t) and Yji(t) are 
random variables. According to [21], it can 
be shown that the conditional probability of 
Xji(t) = n given arrival rate λji, denoted as 
fji(n,t; λji), would be

Therefore, the overall complexity is

the number of possible bandwidth 
allocations. 
Note that one can incorporate as many 
stages of recursion as possible when 
computing the optimal allocation. However, 
the solution would converge after extending 
to certain number of stages. Since the 
computing process of the DPA is actually 
backward, it is important to decide the 
number of stages in advance to avoid the 
waste of computing power. There are more 
discussions on this issue in next subsection. 
 
2.3.3 結果與討論 
2.3.3.1 Simulation Environment 
We evaluate the effectiveness of the 
proposed DPA with C++ coded simulations. 
There are two MVNOs in the simulated 
scenario. MVNO-1 is a VoIP operator and 
MVNO-2 is an IPTV operator. We also 
assume the WBP operates a WiMAX based 
wireless access network. 
The total MAC layer bandwidths 
provided by one single BS are set to be 
9Mbps and 6Mbps for downlink and uplink 
respectively. According to [23], these 
amounts of bandwidth can be achieved via 
either a 5 or 10 MHz channel if efficient 
modulation and coding schemes are 
adopted. 
We assume that the VoIP system 
adopts the G.711 codec and thus each 
direction of a voice call requires 80Kbps of 
bandwidth at MAC layer. The distribution 
of the call duration is exponential with 
mean = 100 seconds. The bandwidth 
requirement for a downlink IPTV stream is 
assumed to be 768Kbps and the service 
time distribution is exponential with mean = 
2500 seconds.  
Fig. 12 shows the arrival rate patterns 
for a 24-hour period and Table II gives the 
costs and the dropping penalties of each 
MVNO. The pricing policy together with 
the traffic pattern affects the expected 
revenue from each MVNO and thus the 
allocation strategy of the WBP. Therefore, it

stages increases, the gain of the total 
revenue gradually saturates just as expected. 
Fig. 14 gives an example of the 
resulting bandwidth allocations via 
computing different number of stages in 
DPA. We find that the results of 4 and 
5-stage DPA are very close to the 3-stage 
DPA in most simulation repetitions under 
the default parameter settings. Hence, only 
the plots of 1 to 3-stage DPA bandwidth 
allocations are shown in Fig. 14. This 
example shows that one can get “smoother'” 
bandwidth allocations, i.e. there are less 
bandwidth fluctuations, if more stages are 
incorporated in the DPA. In addition, since 
the average service time of IPTV customers 
is longer than the length of a single stage, 
DPA with 3 or more stages can predict the 
behavior of them well and allocate more 
resources to MVNO-2. On the other hand, 
the results in the first two plots do not 
allocate as sufficient bandwidth to 
MVNO-2 during the peak of its arrival 
pattern. 
The blocking probabilities under 
different stages of DPA are shown in Table 
III. Obviously, all DPA results outperform 
the fixed allocation scheme. As the number 
of stages increases, the blocking 
probabilities of IPTV customers decrease 
while those of the VoIP customers increase. 
This is because the optimality equation 
considers only the total revenue. It is 
possible to add some QoS constraints, such 
as the minimum blocking probability, in the 
service level agreements between WBP and 
MVNOs, and thus the optimality equations 
should be revised to reflect the change in 
the model. 
In order to examine the relationship 
between the number of stages and the 
average service time, we ran another set of 
simulations with the average connection 
duration of the IPTV customer doubled (i.e. 
mean = 5000 sec.). Accordingly, the arrival 
rates are halved to maintain the same traffic 
loads. Fig. 15 is the resulting average total 
revenues. Notice that the total revenues are 
higher while the traffic loads are kept the 
same. This is because that the blocking rate 
of IPTV customers decreases as the arrival 
rate gets smaller. Therefore, the increase in 
revenue mainly comes from MVNO-2.  
The revenue improvements vary from 
17.7% to 23.9% in the second set of 
simulations. Furthermore, unlike the 
previous case, the improvement of total 
revenue saturates after incorporating 4 
stages instead of 3 stages. It shows that 
more stages are required if the probability 
that a connection duration might span 
several stages increases. However, the
