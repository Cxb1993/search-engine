proposing designing the procedure in
Sliding-Crank mechanism dynamic
analysis and much goal optimization, in
order to design suitable for washing and
cutting the organization measurement
processed automatic allying. Adopt the
mouth method in the field to design many
goal optimizations in the article, in order

from the previous studies, the vision
servo system of an non-contact
measurement of a charge coupled device
(CCD) camera is employed in this paper
to control the color pattern output state
instead of using the expensive linear scale
or encoder of the motor-mechanism
coupled system. Finally, from the well
agreements between numerical
simulations and experimental results, it is
convinced that the proposed controller by
using of machine vision is robust to
external disturbances for a punching
machine system.

3of a toggle mechanism have been studied
previously. Lin et al. [4] proposed a
fuzzy logic controller, which was based
on the concept of hitting condition
without using the complex mathematical
model for a motor-mechanism coupled
system. The fuzzy neural network
controller [5-7] was applied to control a
Slide-Crank servomechanism. The
numerical results via the inverse
dynamics control and variable structure
control are compared [8] for an
electrohydraulic actuated Slide-Crank
mechanism. The variable structure
control [9] was employed to a
Slide-Crank mechanism, which was
driven by a linear synchronous and the
joint coulomb friction was considered. In
these studies, the linear scale or encoder
was employed as the sensor to feedback
the position and speed.
In the previous papers [4-9], the
controllers are difficult to realize if the
feedback sensor can not be installed in a
Slide-Crank mechanism for real
operational condition. In many
motor-mechanism systems, the same
tough problem is difficult to install a
feedback sensor in the mechanism.
Therefore, the non-contact measurement
vision system exhibits its merit to
measure the responses of a output slider
of the punching machine and the state of
the Slide-Crank mechanism.
Chapter 2 Dynamic formulation of a
slider crank mechanism
A slider-crank mechanism is a single
looped mechanism with a very simple
construction shown in Fig. 1 and the
experimental equipment of a slider-crank
mechanism is shown in Fig. 2. It consists
of three parts: a rigid disk, which is
driven by a servomotor, a connecting rod
and a slider.

Fig. 2 Experimental Instrument of a Slider-Crank
Mechanism.
Figure 1 shows the physical model of a
slider-crank mechanism, where the mass
center and the radius of the rigid disk are
denoted as point “O” and length “r”, 
respectively. And “l” is denoted as the 
length of the connected rod AB . The
angle  is between OA and the X-axis,
while the angle  is between the rod
AB and the X-axis.
Hamilton’s principle, Lagrange
multiplier, geometric constraints and
partitioning method are employed to
formulate the differential-algebraic
equation (DAE) for a slider-crank
mechanism. The angles  and  are
selected as the generalized coordinates.
The complete derivation of the equations
of motion is given in [6]. By taking
account of the control force and
constraint force, the equation in the
matrix form can be obtained as
5Therefore, the S/N ratio of design factors
are all less then -28.29Db (-10 log262).
Chapter 4 Motion measurement and
control based on machine vision system
In the real situations, the general
problem encountered in the design
controller is that the bounds of the
uncertainties and exact mathematical
model of a motor-mechanism system are
difficult to obtain for practical
applications. Moreover, the parameters
can not be obtained directly and the
output slider B must be unconstrained
measured for a Sliding-Crank mechanism.
Finally, the red color pattern is applied as
the feedback signal by machine vision
system for these controllers
experimentally.
4.1 PD-type fuzzy logic controller
The control problem is to find a
PD-type FLC law such that the output
Bx can track the desired trajectories
*
Bx
in the presence of uncertainties. Let the
tracking error be
*
BB xxe  (2)
The signals of e and eare selected as
the inputs for the proposed PD- type
FLC.
The control input of the PD-type FLC
is u , which denotes the change of
controller outputs. The signals of e and
ecould be respectively transferred to
their corresponding universes of
discourse by multiplying scaling factors
pk and dk , namely,
., depe keEkeE   (3)
Since the control input u of the FLC is
in its corresponding universe of discourse,
the u could be transferred, by
multiplying a scaling factor uG , to an
actual input of the plant, namely,
.* uGuU  (4)
Because the data manipulation in a
PD-type FLC is based on the fuzzy set
theory, the associated fuzzy sets involved
in the linguistic control rules are defined
as follows:
N : Negative, Z : Zero, P : Positive NB :
Negative Big, NM : Negative Medium
NS : Negative Small, ZE : Zero
PS : Positive Small PM : Positive
Medium PB : Positive Big
and their universe of discourse are all
assigned to be [-10, 10] that of the range
is for a real experimental motor. In the
following, the rule base of the proposed
PD-type FLC are systematically
constructed on the basis in a Lyapnuov
function fL
2
2
1
eL f  and .eeL f  (5)
According to Lyapnuov stable theory,
if the system is stable, the conditions
0ee are necessary. Therefore,
according to Eq. (5), if 0e , increasing
u will result in decreasing ee; if 0e ,
decreasing u will result in decreasing
ee. Hence, the control input u can be
designed in an attempt to satisfy the
condition 0ee .
4. 2 PI-type fuzzy logic controller
In this section, the proposed PI-type
FLC [3] is designed based on the concept
of hitting switch conditions. The
switching functions s and s are
selected as the inputs. In practical
implementation, s can be approximated
by
7point .02.0 df HC  1f , 2f and 3f
are the objective functions respectively.
Step 2: confirmation experiment
To find different responses of nonlinear
effects, three parameters are selected for
each design factors and the control
factors A, B and C are arranged
respectively. Considering the design
factors are not influence each other and
the degree of freedom of design factors is
8.
Step 3: Analysis of variance
One method of analyzing data for
process optimization is to use the analysis
of variance (ANOVA), which is a quick
and easy method to analyze results of
parameter design. When the above
optimal level of the control factors have
been selected, the final step is to verify
the improvement of the quality
characteristic by using the best design
parameters. The designer can select
satisfy size in some condition from the
solution sets effectively.
Step 4: achievement estimation
The optimal design of a Sliding-Crank
mechanism is shown in Table 1.

5.2 Machine vision system
In the practical experiments of the
Sliding-Crank mechanism system, the
main characteristic is that the machine
vision system of a digital CCD camera is
employed as a feedback sensor. Its merit
is to paste only a color pattern on where
want to be controlled; that is the output
position can be controlled to a desired
position by use of the digital CCD
camera to acquire the color pattern image.
The experimental control system does not
need to set up the complex and expensive
measurement sensors, for examples: the
linear scales or encoders.
The machine vision system used in this
paper takes a circular red-color pattern. It
has advantage to use color pattern in
differentiating slider B from its near
monotonic surrounding fast. In the vision
system, one full frame of image consists
of 752582 pixels. Searching the whole
video data of a full frame for the moving
object of slider B usually takes a quite
long time, and degrades the performance
of the visual serving system. Thus, the
image frame is adjusted by a CCD
camera to contain the controlled position
of the slider B.
After the experimental calibration,
pattern matching is the first step for
implementing machine vision system.
The machine vision serving control
algorithm is implemented by using
LabVIEW associated with the image
acquisition card PCI 1405. In the
controlled image frame, the circular
9simulations with identified parameters are
compared well with the experimental
results.
This paper successfully demonstrates
the application of a PI-type FLC by
machine vision to the position control of
a slider of the punching machine. The
procedure begins a derivation with
dynamic formulations that have been set
up successfully, and give a well
description of the Sliding-Crank
mechanism by comparing the
experimental results with two types FLC
and adaptive controller. Furthermore, the
color and shape patterns design
procedures of the machine vision are
described in detail. Moreover, simulation
and experimental results are provided to
demonstrate the robust control
performance of the proposed PI-type FLC
and adaptive control by machine vision.

The system becomes an initial value problem and can be 
directly integrated by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta 
method. 
III. MODIFIED PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
3.1 Particle swarm optimization 
Birds (particles) flocking optimizes a certain objective 
function in a PSO system. Each agent knows its best value so 
far (pbest) and its position. This information is analogy of 
personal experiences of each agent. Moreover, each agent 
knows the best value so far in the group (gbest) among pbests.
This information is analogy of knowledge of how the other 
agents around them have performed. The PSO concept [5-6] 
consists of changing the velocity of each particle toward its 
pbest and gbest locations. In the PSO, each particle moves to 
a new position according to new velocity and the previous 
positions of the particle. This is compared with the best 
position generated by previous particles in the fitness function, 
and the best one is kept; so each particle accelerates in the 
direction of not only the local best solution but also the global 
best position. If a particle discovers a new probable solution, 
other particles will move closer to it to explore the region 
more completely in the process. 
In general, there are three attributes, current position jx ,
current velocity jv  and past best position jpbest , for 
particles in the search space to present their features. Each 
particle in the swarm is iteratively updated according to the 
aforementioned attributes. For example [5-11], the jth particle 
is represented as xj = (xj,1, xj,2,…, xj,g) in the g-dimensional 
space. The best previous position of the jth particle is 
recorded and represented as pbestj = (pbestj,1, pbestj,2,…, 
pbestj,g). The index of best particle among all particles in the 
group is represented by the gbestg. The rate of the position 
change (velocity) for particle j is represented as vj = (vj,1,
vj,2,…, vj,g). The modified velocity and position of each 
particle can be calculated using the current velocity and 
distance from pbestj,g to gbestj,g as shown in the following 
formulas[11]: 
World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 65 2010

Stopping Criteria: Stopping criteria is given in the 
following order: 
1) maximum allowable number of iterations reached. 
2) number of iterations reached without improving the 
current best solution.

3.3 Parameter identifications 
How to define the fitness function is the key point of the 
MPSO, since the fitness function is a figure of merit, and 
could be computed by using any domain knowledge. In this 
paper, we adopt the fitness function as follows [14,15]:

where n  is the total number of samples and 
iE  is the 
calculated error of the i th sampling time, *( )ix  is a solution 
by using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to solve the 
dynamic Equations (12) for the PM synchronous servomotor 
drive coupled with a slider-crank mechanism with the 
parameters identified from these two methods, and 
( )ix  is the 
displacement measured experimentally at the i th sampling 
time.

MPSO and PSO methods to identify the 5 parameters

described as Eq. (27). The identified results are given in

MPSO methods of the slider-crank mechanism system. It is 
seen from Fig. 4 that the proposed MPSO method is superior

V. CONCLUSIONS
The dynamic formulations of a slider-crank mechanism 
driven by a field-oriented PM synchronous motor have been 
successfully formulated with only one independent variable. 
Furthermore, the main objective of this study is to utilize PSO 
and MPSO methods to identify a slider-crank mechanism 
driven by a servomotor. According to the comparisons 
between identified results and displacement errors, it is found 
that MPSO method has the best matching with the
