a variety of factors, such as the spore concentration inoculated, the time-point at which CaCO3 is 
added to the shake flask culture, and the addition of both mineral support and polyethylene oxide 
(Bai et al., 2003; Kosakai et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998; Yin et al., 1998). Theoretically, fungal 
morphology affects the mass transfer efficiency in the culture and thus determines the rates of 
substrate uptake and metabolite production. The mass transfer rate associated with mycelial 
morphology ranks in the following order, from the highest to the lowest: floc, pellet and clump. 
Therefore, the production of lactic acid might be enhanced if cultures only contain mycelial flocs of 
R. oryzae. Yet, very little is known about the environmental and physiological factors to sustain floc 
morphology of R. oryzae in submerged cultures. During the fermentation in bioreactors, mycelia 
tend to form clumps that adhere everywhere in the bioreactor, resulting in poor production of lactic 
acid (Kosakai et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998; Yin et al., 1998). In order to avoid the formation of 
mycelial clumps in cultures of R. oryzae, past research has focused on lactic acid production using 
mycelial pellets (Bai et al., 2003; Yin et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 1999) or immobilized cells 
(Efremenko et al., 2006; Hamamci and Ryu, 1994; Hang et al., 1989; Tay and Yang, 2002). In those 
works, the influences of nitrogen source on R. oryzae morphology and lactic acid production were 
not discussed. However, our preliminary experiments found that nitrogen-rich medium enables R. 
oryzae to maintain floc morphology longer than that in minimal medium. It suggests that the 
formation of mycelial clumps in R. oryzae culture may result from the depletion of nitrogen source 
in cultural medium. Therefore, a fermentation strategy associated with the supplementary addition 
of nitrogen source during fermentation has been developed. R. oryzae was successfully cultured in 
floc morphology throughout the fermentation process and the production of lactic acid was 
enhanced. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Microorganism and Media 
 
R. oryzae ATCC 9363 was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA), where spores were 
produced. The medium for the seed culture consisted of the following ingredients (g/L): glucose 50, 
glutamic acid 3, KH2PO4 0.6, MgSO4•7H2O 0.5, ZnSO4•7H2O 0.04. The medium for lactic acid 
production consisted of the following ingredients (g/L): glucose 125, (NH4)2SO4 2 (initial 
concentration), KH2PO4 0.3, MgSO4•7H2O 0.25, ZnSO4•7H2O 0.04. The initial pH of all media was 
adjusted to 6.0 with NaOH. During the lactic acid fermentation in the bioreactor, 40% (w/w) CaCO3 
slurry was added automatically to control the pH in a predetermined range. All media were 
autoclaved at 121ºC for 15 min. Glucose was autoclaved separately. 
 
Batch Fermentation for Lactic Acid Production 
 
R. oryzae was grown on the PDA in a wide-bottom Erlenmeyer flask, with a diameter of 14 
cm, at 30ºC for 5~7 days. Spores were suspended with 0.02% (w/v) Tween-20 solution and then

When the lactic acid fermentation was carried out around pH 4.5 in the bioreactor, the 
morphology of the R. oryzae culture without replenishing ammonium-nitrogen showed clumps 
formed and adhered profusely to the interior of the bioreactor (Figure 1a). With replenish of 
ammonium-nitrogen, the culture manifested cotton-like floc morphology at h 20 (Figure 1b). 
Massive mycelial flocs were then produced after a 40-h fermentation (Figure 1c). Figure 1 indicated 
that nitrogen source is required not only for the bioactivities such as cell growth but also for the 
mycelial structure of R. oryzae to sustain floc morphology. However, the lactic acid production was 
not enhanced accordingly. 
In the conventional cultures of R. oryzae for lactic acid production, the cultural medium is rich 
in carbohydrates, while the concentration of nitrogen source is limited. Mineral supports have been 
added to maintain R. oryzae morphology in floc form (Kosakai et al., 1997; Park et al., 1998). In 
this work, we found that we could prevent mycelia from aggregation, which is normally 
encountered in R. oryzae cultures, by replenishing ammonium-nitrogen in the cultural medium. This 
suggests that the formation of mycelial clumps in R. oryzae cultures may be due primarily to the 
depletion of nitrogen source. The cell wall of R. oryzae is rich in chitosan (Pochanavanich et al., 
2002), which is responsible for the rigidity and the elongation of hyphae (Borgia et al., 1996). 
Because the nitrogen nutrient is required for the chitosan synthesis, the biosynthesis of chitosan is 
retarded during the nitrogen starvation, and the properties of mycelia may be altered, resulting in 
the formation of mycelia clump. 
 
Effect of Phosphate Concentration on Lactic Acid Production 
 
The phosphate level in the minimal medium conventionally used for lactic acid production is 
critical for cell growth. In this study, when the fermentation was carried out using the minimal 
medium with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 g/L of KH2PO4 at pH around 4.5 in the bioreactor, lactic acid 
productivities were 2.12, 2.73 and 2.73 g/L-h, respectively, with a similar conversion rate of 0.87 
being achieved. This meant that 0.3 g/L of KH2PO4 is sufficient for the optimal production of lactic 
acid. 
 
Effect of pH on Lactic Acid Production 
 
Table 1 shows the results of lactic acid fermentations by R. oryzae carried out at various pH 
ranges. Both the biomass and consuming rate of glucose increased with the increase in pH. The 
productivity and conversion rate of lactic acid peaked at pH 4.3~4.5. Figure 2 shows the time 
course of the fermentation by R. oryzae at pH 4.3~4.5. The fermentation was completed in 40 h. 
The average lactic acid productivity was 2.73 g/L-h and the final lactic acid concentration was 109 
g/L, with the conversion rate of 0.87 using 125 g/L of glucose as substrate. At the pH higher than 
4.5, the productivity increased along with the increase in pH, but the yield of lactic acid decreased. 
During the fermentation, depleted glucose is mainly converted into biomass, lactic acid and

CONCLUSION 
 
This study has enhanced production of lactic acid using mycelial flocs of R. oryzae. The floc 
morphology of the submerged culture was successfully sustained throughout the fermentation 
process by the supplementary addition of ammonium-nitrogen to the culture medium. When the 
fermentation was controlled at pH 4.3~4.5 by automatically adding CaCO3 slurry, an optimal 
production of lactic acid was achieved. The fermentation strategy used in this work is very simple 
and feasible for the lactic acid production by cultures of R. oryzae. Furthermore, the lactic acid 
production using this fermentation strategy is higher than that mycelial pellets or immobilized cells 
were used.
