Abstract 
Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial/Handheld (DVB-T/H) systems require a core computation 
of 2K/4K/8K-point Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The major design challenge is that the 
length of the FFT is not only long but also variable. There are only very few works discussing 
long length FFT design, and almost none of them has discussed the solutions for the difficulty of 
variable length computation. To solve this design challenge, this work presents a multi-radix FFT 
using Pipeline in Memory-based Architecture (PIMA). The proposed PIMA FFT processor 
combines both the merits of pipeline architectures and those of memory-based architectures. Thus, 
this work possesses the features of high data throughput rate and high flexibility without 
incurring the issue of high memory access. This work has been designed and verified thoroughly 
following the VLSI design flow. After implemented using the 1P6M TSMC 0.18-µm CMOS 
technology, this work can meet the FFT performance requirements of DVB-T/H with only 5 MHz 
frequency.

combine the merits of the memory-based architecture and those of the pipeline architecture 
together and proposes the so-called Pipeline In Memory-based Architecture (PIMA) for 
2K/4K/8K-point FFT. The proposed architecture is macroscopically similar to the memory-based 
architecture and microscopically similar to the pipeline architecture. Therefore, the PIMA 
possesses the advantages of high data throughput rate, high computation efficiency, and high 
flexibility. 
The rest of this report is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a review for the FFT and discusses 
the design challenges. Section 3 then presents the design and implementation of the proposed 
FFT processor. Section 4 describes the performance evaluation and comparison. At last, Section 5 
presents conclusions. 
DESIGN CHLLENGES OF 2K/4K/8K FFT FOR DVB-T/H SYSTEMS 
In DVB-T systems, which are for terrestrial television broadcasting, two transmission modes, 
namely a 2K mode and an 8K mode, are used [12]. The 8K mode is used for small to large Single 
Frequency Networks (SFNs) and provides a Doppler tolerance allowing high speed reception; the 
2K mode is adopted for only small SFNs and provides a Doppler tolerance allowing extremely 
high speed reception. Therefore, the 2K-point FFT and the 8K-point FFT computations are 
necessary to carry out the OFDM modulation. Furthermore, a third transmission mode named 4K 
mode is defined exclusively in DVB-H systems which are specified for handheld terminals [13]. 
As a result, the 4K-point FFT computation is also needed besides the 2K-point and the 8K-point 
FFT computations. Therefore, to design a variable length FFT is the first challenge of this work. 
The remaining design challenges include achieving the real-time performance requirement of the 
DVB-T/H system and lowering down the power consumption for mobile applications. To 
investigate more, we first give a brief review of the FFT algorithm. The N-point Discrete Fourier 
Transform (DFT) of a sequence x(n) is defined as (1) in the follows:

The computational complexity of (1) is O(N2) when the required computations are directly 
executed. The computational complexity can be reduced to O(N Nrlog ) using the FFT algorithm 
[14], where r denotes that the radix-r FFT algorithm is adopted. Obviously, the computational 
complexity decreases as the radix increases for the constant length DFT computation. This 
indicates that lager radices are more suitable for long length DFT computations. However, here 
 4 
multiplications and complex additions to equivalent real multiplications and real additions, listed 
in the last two columns in Table 1. The normalized data of Table 1 are showed in Table 2, in 
which we find that using radix-16 algorithm can result in the lowest computation complexity. 
Meanwhile, radix-16 algorithm has never been adopted to compute high length FFT. These 
reasons motivate us to explore the design issues of using radix-16 algorithm for long length 
FFTs. 
After making the choice of algorithm, we plan to design the hardware architecture. As mentioned 
in Section 2, cache-memory architectures have the problem of exponentially increased cache size 
when the radix number increases. Because we adopt a rather large radix size, i.e. radix-16, 
cache-memory architecture is not suitable for this work. Pipeline architecture may be more proper; 
however, the hardware cost is too high, especially for long length FFT computations. If we 
re-classify the FFT architectures according to the degree of time-multiplexing, the memory-based 
architecture (including cached-memory architecture) and the pipeline architecture are 
respectively on the extremely two different ends as shown in Fig. 1. There are several extremely 
opposite features in these two architectures such as the data throughput rate, the area cost, the 
controller complexity, and the memory access issue. Fig. 1 inspires us to develop a VLSI 
architecture named Pipeline In Memory-based Architecture (PIMA) which combines the merits 
of both memory-based architecture and pipeline architecture. Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed PIMA 
FFT processor. From a macroscopic point of view, PIMA is similar to the memory-based 
architecture where a memory block exists for temporal input data storage, intermediate data 
storage, and data regulation. From a microscopic point of view, the butterfly unit, a centric 
computation unit of PIMA, is designed in a pipeline manner. There are mainly two options for 
designing the pipeline butterfly unit, i.e. the Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC) architecture 
and the Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) architecture, as shown in Fig. 3. Either the pipeline 
butterfly unit illustrated in Fig. 3 can finish a complete radix algorithm, e.g. radix-16 algorithm, 
on its own, and does not need to store/load the intermediate data in/from the main memory. Thus, 
the memory access issue of memory-based architecture is solved. On the other hand, PIMA 
possesses the merits of memory-based architecture such as low area cost and high flexibility. The 
merit of high flexibility enables PIMA to compute variable length FFT. The only design effort for 
variable length FFT computation is to develop a multi-radix butterfly unit. From some hardware 
performance analysis, we decide to carry out the butterfly unit based on MDC architecture, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 4. The proposed multi-radix butterfly unit is composed of four smaller 
radix-2 butterfly units. By inserting some multiplexers and de-multiplexers properly, this unit can 
compute multiple radices, e.g radix-2/23/24 required in 2K/4K/8K-point FFT processing.
