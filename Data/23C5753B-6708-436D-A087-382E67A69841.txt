Abstract- In this project, a novel current sensorless 
control for single-phase boost-type switching-mode 
rectifier (SMR) is developed and digitally implemented in 
DSP-based system. Compared to the conventional 
multi-loop control structure with inner current loop and 
outer voltage loop, it is noted that there is only one 
voltage loop tuning the phase of pre-defined duty pattern 
(i.e. duty phase) in the proposed sensorless control. Due to 
no current loop, sampling inductor current and tracking 
current tracking are unnecessary when SMRs are 
operated to obtain sinusoidal current waveform and 
regulate the output voltage. In this report, first, the effect 
of the duty phase on the input current is analyzed and 
modeled. It shows that the sinusoidal current waveform 
can be naturally generated by the pre-defined duty 
pattern and the current amplitude is roughly 
proportional to the controllable duty phase. Then, a 
voltage controller is designed to regulate the dc output 
voltage by tuning this duty phase. Finally, some simulated 
and experimental results have been given to illustrate the 
performances of the proposed current sensorless control.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The AC/DC converter is an essential component for 
most power electronic systems to build up DC-link 
voltage source from the AC mains. The use of 
switching-mode-rectifier (SMR) [1-3] with power 
factor correction (PFC) function is an effective mean to 
perform the AC/DC conversion with high quality by 
shaping the input current waveform and regulating the 
output voltage. The boost-type SMRs are the most 
popular circuit topology among all the others to shape 
the current waveform for their continuous current in the 
front-end inductors [1]. 
In order to let the boost-type SMRs have good input 
and output performances, many types of voltage and 
current control approaches have been developed, such 
as feedforward current control [3-5], robust voltage and 
current control [3,6] and predictive current control 
[7-8]. The multi-loop control is the most popular 
structure to coordinate the individual voltage and 
current control to meet the input and output 
specifications by controlling the single power switch. 
However, there are two drawbacks in the common 
multi-loop control for boost-type SMRs. One is that the 
output voltage ripple through the outer voltage loop 
will result in the distorted current command into the 
inner current loop. The other is the difficulty of 
deciding the current sampling instants due to the large 
variations in the switching duty of the boost-type 
SMRs. However, it is cleared that the above two 
problems are relating to the inner current loop and, thus, 
if there is no current loop in the control structure, both 
the problems and the cost of current sensing can be 
removed in the operations of boost-type SMRs. It 
implies that only one voltage loop is included in the 
final control structure, and thus, such single-loop 
control structure is very competitive for its simplicity.  
The proposed current sensorless control can be seen 
as the single-loop structure with only one voltage loop 
tuning the phase of the pre-defined duty pattern (i.e. 
duty phase). Compared to the simple single-loop 
voltage mode control under discontinuous current 
mode (DCM), the proposed single-loop sensorless 
control is working in continuous current mode (CCM).  
The report is organized as follows. Initially, the 
phase effect of the pre-defined duty pattern on input 
current is analyzed and modeled. The results show that 
the sinusoidal current waveform can be automatically 
generated by the pre-defined duty pattern and the input 
current amplitude is roughly proportional to the duty 
phase. Subsequently, based on the effect of duty phase 
on the input current amplitude, a voltage controller can 
be included to regulate the dc output voltage by means 
of tuning the duty phase. Finally, some simulated and 
experimental results have been given to illustrate the 
performance of the proposed current sensorless control. 
The measurements also show that the drawn harmonic 
currents are well below the limits of the standard IEC 
61000-2-3. 
 
II. BOOST-TYPE SMRS 
A. Modeling 
As shown in Fig. 1, the power circuit of the 
boost-type SMR mainly consists of a diode bridge 
rectifier and a boost-type DC/DC converter. In order to 
model the behaviors of the boost-type SMR, some 
assumptions are initially made:  
(i) Circuit elements are ideal and thus, lossless;  
(ii) Power switch SW operates at a switching 
frequency approaching infinity. 
(iii) A bulk capacitor dC is included in the power 
circuit and thus, the output voltage  can be 
assumed to be its average value .

Therefore, the above three assumptions allows the 
following equation on an instantaneous basis.

where  and are the instantaneous input 
power and output power, respectively. Furthermore, 
when the boost-type SMR is operating in CCM with 
unity power factor, the drawn input power  can 
be expressed as the product of input current 
 and input voltage .

following time-differential equations for inductor

obtained by removing the absolute operators in (13)

Noted that the inductor current waveform becomes

Besides, because the input current amplitude s  
can be controlled by its dependency on the duty phase

with unity power factor by tuning the duty phase θ . 
That is, we can include a voltage controller to 
automatically adjust the suitable duty phase θ  to 
meet the requirement of current waveform shaping and 
output voltage regulation.

IV. SIMULATED RESULTS 
In this section, we begin with a series of computer 
simulations to demonstrate the proposed sensorless 
control. Some nominal values and circuit elements are 
listed in Table I. It should be noted that no design 
optimization has been done in order to select the values 
Then, we increase the load to  with 
the same voltage command =300V and illustrate 
the experimental waveform in Fig. 7. In order to yield 
suitable current amplitude to meet the new load 
condition, the duty phase is automatically tuned to 
about

≈θ 0.028π rads through the voltage loop.  
From (8), all the duty patterns in Fig. 5 through Fig.7 
are the same because of the same input and output 
voltage level. The only differences between them are 
their phase which is the main originality of this project . 
In addition, although the current waveforms are not 
pure sinusoidal ones, the proposed contorl still possess 
useful input and output performances.

IV. REALIZATION 
The proposed current sensorless control has been 
digitally implemented in a DSP-based system using 
TMS320F240 where a simple and popular PI-type 
voltage loop is used in order to focus on the 
performance of tuning duty phase. Only input voltage 
and output voltages are sensed where the former 
provides the phase information of input voltage and the 
latter helps to regulate the output voltage. It is noted 
that the digital resolution of duty phase is the main 
challenge in the implementation of the proposed 
current sensorless control. Too small phase resolution 
would result in the instable operation of SMRs in 
shaping current waveform. In my experiment, the 
phase resolution is set to 12500 per π rads. All the 
circuit parameters in the experimental system have 
been listed in Table. I. 
 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Fig. 8 shows the measured waveforms for the 
condition  and . The top plot 
shows the output voltage waveform varying around the 
desired voltage level. The duty phase signal in the 
middle plot is fixed around 0.028π rads in order to 
stably yield the input current as shown in the bottom 
plot. From the bottom plots of input current and 
voltage, we can find that the actual current waveform is 
very close to the simulated one in Fig. 7 and the 
measured power factor now is 0.944. Obviously, input 
power quality has been improved and the proposed 
current sensorless control has been demonstrated.

In Fig. 9, the average duty phase signal )(td  is 
shown and the reference signal is also plotted for 
comparison. We can find that the little phase difference 
between the top plots contributes to draw the distorted 
current waveform similar to the waveform shown in 
Fig. 7. 
Fig. 10 shows the measured waveforms at 
 and input power . In order to 
draw smaller current amplitude for smaller input power, 
the duty phase signal in the middle plot is 
automatically adjusted from about 0.028π rads to 
0.024π rads by the voltage loop. It also implies that the 
proposed current sensorless control is able to vary the 
output voltage simply by varying the phase of the 
per-defined duty pattern.
