A simple fabrication of tapered subwavelength anti-reflective nanostructures 
using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template 
 
ABSTRACT 
This paper reports the development of a gas-assisted hot embossing process using anodic 
aluminum oxide (AAO) templates for fabricating nano-holes structures on polycarbonate (PC) 
film. In this study, the alumina membranes with 80nm and 170nm pitches were fabricated via a 
two-step anodization, employing 0.1 M oxalic acid as an electrolyte with an anodization voltage 
of 40 V and 80V. The pore diameter can be controlled by adjusting time and temperature of pore 
enlargement. The result shows that the nanostructures can be uniformly fabricated onto the 
surface of polymer substrates by using gas-assisted hot embossing process. The filling height of 
nanostructure can be controlled by controlling the temperature and pressure. It also provides the 
anti-reflective component has been successfully employed to fabricate.

1. INTRODUCTION 
    Light reflection from surfaces can seriously deteriorate the performance of an optical device 
by causing stray light or degrading the transmission of optical components. Anti-reflection films 
[1-2] are therefore widely used in consumer electronics, such as displays. Generally, 
anti-reflection films can be classified to two types: those with multi-layer coatings and those with 
sub-wavelength structures (SWSs). In this study, the facility and process for fabrication of 
tapered SWSs on the polycarhonate (PC) film using gas-assisted hot embossing [3] with an AAO 
template has been implemented. 
 
2. EXPERIMENTS 
    The AAO template fabricated using a two-step anodization process has a pitch of 180 nm, a 
diameter of 100 nm and a depth of 2.1 Âµm. Using the gas-assisted hot embossing, the heated and 
soften PC film was protruded into the nano-pores in the AAO template (Fig. 1). In order to 
observe the complete protruded nanostructures, the AAO template was removed by wet-chemical 
etching. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the fabricated PC with pillar submicron structures 
fabricated under the gas pressure of 25 kgf/cm2 and the embossing temperature from 140?????
160?. The submicron structures heights are about 50nm, 350nm, and 570nm respectively.

gas-assisted hot embossing processes. To obtained the tapered nanostructures, instead of
