Abstract 
In the contemporary electronic commerce 
(EC) environment, e-catalogs are widely used 
for conducting marketing practice. E-catalogues 
are widely used for presenting product 
information in e-commerce environment. 
Currently, many companies send product 
information to potential customers via e-mails, 
but there is a spam problem preventing such 
e-mails from reaching their target customers. 
Nevertheless, personalization is now considered 
as an important marketing strategy, so that mass 
distribution of e-catalogues may become less 
desirable for companies. In this study, we 
developed an innovative service platform for 
efficiently creating and effectively delivering 
personalized e-catalogues to target customers. 
This study not only utilizes but contributes to 
the body of knowledge associated with the 
emergent Web 2.0 concepts, service-oriented 
architecture, and Web-feed technologies.

1. Introduction & Research Objective 
Because of their flexibility, low cost, ease 
of use, and fast distribution, electronic 
catalogues (e-catalogues) are used by companies 
to present product/service specific information 
via e-mails delivery to target customers [1, 2]. 
However, there exists a serious issue related to 
the spam problem [3], which prevents such 
e-catalogue embedded e-mails from reaching 
target customers. Nevertheless, personalization 
is now considered as an important marketing 
strategy [4], and therefore mass distribution of 
e-catalogues may become less desirable for 
companies. In this project, we developed an 
innovative service platform for efficiently 
creating and effectively delivering personalized 
e-catalogues to target customers, by utilizing the 
the emergent Web 2.0 concepts, service-oriented 
architecture, and Web-feed technologies. 
The proposed framework takes advantage 
of search techniques and the "mashup" concept 
suggested by Web 2.0. Using the active way of 
search techniques allows users to specify key 
words and related options, and then the 
approximate or accurate results will be sorted 
out and presented to users as search results. Web 
2.0 emphasizes on interactive and cooperative 
methods, community interaction, collective 
intelligence, lightweight technologies, and 
4 
a Web services handler for providing a 
connection between service requesters and 
service providers, 
2. the catalogue content server (CCS) which is 
a service provider generating data and 
publishing content information to SBS in 
WSDL format, 
3. the e-catalogue service server (ESS) which 
contains a content database for generating 
e-catalogue content locally. For the 
information unavailable locally, the 
information can be acquired by ESS from 
other content providers through the joint 
efforts of SBS, CCS, and other ESS, 
4. the user client (UC) which is a PC or device 
that contains a feed reader for subscribing to 
the e-catalogue service,  
5. the content provider client (CPC) which 
enables the content provider to remotely 
manage catalogue content. 
2.3. Description of System Components 
Containing a content database and a 
services handler, CCS publishes and sends 
content information to SBS. Then, SBS saves 
this information for future queries. Sooner or 
later, ESS might query SBS for the information 
about that particular service. After the query 
process, SBS will not get involved with the 
subsequent e-catalogue creation process; instead, 
SBS will switch to the listening mode for 
accepting other service registrations or queries.  
ESS, the most complex component of 
WBSF, may generate user-subscribed and 
customized e-catalogues. ESS is equipped with a 
user management module and a database storing 
user preference information to serve various 
user requirements. In terms of providing 
e-catalogue content, ESS contains a content 
database for presenting locally available content, 
and for the content unavailable locally, ESS 
would acquire it from other content providers 
through the joint efforts of SBS, CCS, and other 
ESS. Actually, ESS may perform two different 
functions; one is to create the e-catalogue and 
the other is to offer the content to other servers. 
This multisource design requires a component to 
filter out conflicting data and select the most 
up-to-date information. Eventually, ESS would 
translate the data into Web-feed format by using 
a feed based catalogue-creation subcomponent 
which contains a translation module and a 
Web-feed service module for creating WBSF 
based e-catalogues.  
UC can be a desktop or laptop PC, smart 
phone, PDA, iPod, or other handheld device that 
has a feed reader and network access. WBSF 
based e-catalogues users can connect to ESS via 
a user interface and Internet access, and then 
specify their demands for personalized 
e-catalogues. In general, the user interface can 
be developed by dynamic Web techniques, and 
users can interact with it via browsers. For using 
handheld device like smart phone, if there is a 
browser on the device, users only have to adjust 
its layouts (such as the size of the user interface) 
or the input methods for better performance. 
Lots of UC devices can support various RSS 
feed readers, and such readers can be used to 
subscribe to WBSF based e-catalogues. CPC can 
help content providers remotely manage (create, 
delete, update, re-organize, and so on.) 
catalogue contents by providing remote interface 
to CCS. Dynamic Web pages were developed in 
this study as the interface for CPC users to 
interact with CCS. However, it is possible to 
develop a stand-alone application to serve the 
same content management purpose, but this 
approach would take more time and efforts.  
2.4. Implementation of E-Catalogue Service 
WBSF was developed by adopting SOA, 
6 
and related content files. Similarly, the 
synchronous communications between users and 
the e-catalogue server for all use cases were 
implemented by using the http request/response 
model, and the asynchronous delivery channels 
were implemented to support various operations 
involving asynchronous communications.  
2.4.3. Deployment of E-Catalogue Service  
The WBSF based e-catalogue service was 
deployed by using the virtual machine concept 
to simulate the service oriented collaboration 
environment. Two Microsoft Windows machines 
were physically used in the deployment. Three 
servers including the service broker server 
(SBS), the e-catalogue service server (ESS), and 
the catalogue content server (CCS), were hosted 
on an Intel Core 2 Quad box. The user client 
(UC) and the content provider client (CPC) were 
hosted by an AMD Athlon X2 machine. The role 
and responsibility of each server or client were 
described in Subsection 3.2 explaining System 
Architecture and its components. 
 
 
Figure 3. The code segment of an RSS e-catalogue 
generated by the service 
 
Fig. 3 shows an example of the RSS 
e-catalogue generated by the service. As this 
code segment shows, most of the code is for 
RSS declarations, and the e-catalogue content 
only takes a small portion of the document. 
Technically, ESS must dynamically convert the 
data in SOAP format into RSS format. Fig. 4 
shows an example of viewing an RSS 
e-catalogue in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7. 
The layout in Fig. 4 may look different for 
various RSS readers or handheld device, but the 
contents are virtually the same.

3. Discussion and Conclusion 
Transmission efficiency is an important 
goal considered in the design of e-catalogue in 
mobile commerce environments. The smaller 
the transmission file is, the faster a mobile 
device can load and process it. Less 
transmission resources needed for the same 
information can reduce the communication costs, 
especially for mobile devices. For this reason, 
presenting as much information as possible on a 
mobile device is important design goal of the 
WBSF based e-catalogues.  
A Web based e-catalogue obtained from 
"EZ Travel" (http://www.eztravel.com.tw) and a 
comparable RSS e-catalogue were used to 
compare the transmission requirement. The files

to enhance marketing strategy for attracting a 
niche audience, particularly in the event that 
when traditional marketing approach becomes 
outdated or inconvenient for customers. Our 
study focused on two main concepts, 
specialization of Web-feed content and targeted 
communications, by probing the ways of 
utilizing Web-feed to reach determined target 
groups with suitable one-to-one, one-to-few or 
one-to-many contents customized for various 
targeted groups. Based on WBSF, a sample 
e-catalogue service was designed and 
implemented by using Web-feeds as effective 
asynchronous communication media to enhance 
the effectiveness and efficiency of business 
functions. 
As a matter of fact, WBSF has been 
adapted and used in our research for providing 
valuable Web-feed based services to several 
application domains, including marketing [6], 
m-learning [7], information system services [12], 
tourism services, and other interesting areas. 
The approach of applying WBSF to multiple 
application domains is extremely important for a 
better understanding of designing, refining, and 
enhancing the proposed Web-feed based 
architecture. Every technological environment 
and its application systems in a given domain 
have their specific attributes which require not 
only the use of general design principles but the 
discovery of new specific principles. Web-feed 
is a new technological arena with many exciting 
technologies and vast application potentials. 
Research into the design of useable systems is 
likely not only to widen the scope of its practical 
application but to contribute to developing a 
design theory for Web-feed based applications. 
 
4. Research Accomplishment – a Self 
Evaluation 
The research results related to this NSC 
research project has generated two academic 
articles published by IEEE Computer Society 
Press [13, 14]. In addition, the user study on the 
underlying factors influencing audiences’ 
adoption of podcast assisted services and 
applications were identified and investigated, 
and the results also generated one academic 
article published by an international refereed 
journal [7]. Furthermore, the international 
conference papers published by IEEE Computer 
Society Press are now under our enhancement 
efforts for further submissions to appropriate 
international journals in the near future.  
Based on the fact that three academic 
articles (including two IEEE conference papers 
and one international refereed journal paper) are 
derived from this NSC research project, we are 
therefore assured that our research 
accomplishment meets the original goal of 
designing and implementing a Web feed based 
system with applications for enhancing business 
functions & enterprise services.

search techniques and the “mashup” concept not only 
allows users to specify their needs through a simple user 
interface but enables service providers to effectively and 
dynamically aggregate personalized contents according to 
users’ demands. The focus of this study is to design and 
implement an innovative Web-based e-catalogue service 
framework which can support Web application paradigm, 
minimize client-server interaction requirements, offer a 
flexible operation environment, and provide an easy-to-
operate user interface. To achieve this goal, the emerging 
Web-feed technology was adopted in our study to 
facilitate the asynchronous communication between 
clients and the e-catalogue service. Although most Web-
feed audiences may not wish to become Web-feed 
technology experts, they would be inevitably influenced 
by the potential benefits of using Web-feed technology 
for enhancing the quality of their digital lifestyle. Thus, it 
would be quite interesting to describe how Web-feed 
technology can support the proposed e-catalogue service 
in a cost-effective and easy-to-operate way. 
 
2. Research background 
2.1. Electronic catalogues 
An e-catalogue is a tool for displaying product 
information on a computer, and it can be viewed as an 
Internet-based medium with low distribution costs. E-
catalogue content may not only include images, texts, 
audio/video clips, and hyperlinks, but provide electronic 
indexes or search functions to help users search product 
information. Nowadays, e-catalogues are changing from 
marketing tools to multinational sales channels because 
they present information to users and provide platforms 
for interaction, transactions, and real-time support [2].   
Personalization, an important concept in the 
contemporary marketing, can be used by a company to 
cater to customers' unique requirements, particularly for 
enhancing business performance in e-commerce 
environment. In general, personalization can make users 
feel comfortable, build better relationships with 
customers, increase customer satisfaction, and gain 
customer loyalty [6]. User interface is an important 
element in creating personalized e-commerce experience, 
because users would directly operate such interface. 
Consequently, it is expected that applying personalization 
to e-catalogue design containing friendly user interface 
and useful messages can enhance the utilization rate and 
view time, thus creating more chances to make a sale. 
 
2.2. Web 2.0 and Mashup 
The phrase "Web 2.0" was uttered by Tim O'Reilly 
and his colleagues at O'Reilly Media in 2004 to describe 
the common features of various Web companies that 
survived the “dot–com burst” in late 1990s [7]. It was 
stated by Musser and O'Reilly that “Web 2.0 is a set of 
economic, social, and technology trends that collectively 
form the basis for the next generation of the Internet—a 
more mature, distinctive medium characterized by user 
participation, openness, and network effects” [8]. 
“Mashup” is an idea of Web 2.0 about gathering 
contents or functions from various sources and providing 
a new type of service or content after merging them. 
When a service provider composes Web page content that 
comes from at least two different sites, this kind of 
service can be called mashup [9]. The strength of mashup 
is that the data sources used for mashup are independent 
and can be reused. Using mashup can create a new set of 
services to satisfy different requirements.  
 
2.3. Web feed  
A Web-feed can be viewed as a document which 
contains links to the sources of content and usually 
follows the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
standard; it can also be viewed as a data format used to 
provide users with frequently updated content. Web-feed 
architecture would include subscribers and publishers. 
Subscribers request Web-feeds from publishers through 
feed readers which retrieve messages from servers that 
are provided by publishers. If there is something new in 
the subscribed feed when a reader compares the data, the 
feed reader will remind the subscriber to check the new 
information. Some advanced feed readers can even trace 
the content and automatically download the messages for 
the subscribers. The most commonly used Web-feed 
format is Really Simple Syndication (RSS) which allows 
companies or information service providers to easily, 
inexpensively and quickly get their content delivered to 
their clients, business partners, the media, employees, and 
others throughout the World Wide Web [10, 11]. 
Facilitating the distribution of important files or sensitive 
data to remote computers and subsequently to suitable 
handheld devices, RSS feed technology enables not only 
sending unique and customized contents but engaging 
RSS subscribers to discussions and interactions in an 
asynchronous pervasive computing environment [10, 12].  
 
3. The design of the e-catalogue service 
3.1. The Web-feed based SOA framework 
In our research, RSS feed is chosen as an enabling 
technology for supporting the proposed Web-feed Based 
SOA (service oriented architecture) Framework (WBSF). 
Using RSS feed as a medium to deliver e-catalogues can 
push the content to users efficiently and effectively. 
WBSF inherits the advantages of RSS technology from 
other aspects including: high-speed Internet connections 
suitable for downloading large files, the availability of 
digital music player software and weblog software, the 
popularity of digital audio/video devices, and the 
ubiquitous MP3/MP4 formats. 
4 
4. The implementation of the service 
WBSF was developed by adopting SOA, Web-feed 
technology, Web 2.0 mashup concept, Web application 
paradigm, and other information and communication 
technologies including object-oriented design and 
pervasive computing. In addition to the required logic for 
user registration, authentication and entitlement, the 
desired e-catalogue service was built on top of WBSF for 
providing various supporting functions and operations 
through various modules, including RSS feed creation 
and management module, synchronous interaction 
module, asynchronous delivery module, personalization 
and customization module, user/group management 
module, reporting module, security management module, 
notification and confirmation module, and software 
download and installation module. The overall 
development efforts can be divided into the use case 
development, object modeling and class development 
processes described as follows. 
 
4.1. Use case development  
Use case diagram, which is one of the key diagrams 
of Unified Modeling Language (UML), can describe the 
intended functions of the system and provide input to 
identify roles and deliverables in the organizations [13]. 
Specifically, a use case diagram consists of actors (i.e., 
the units or people in the organization that are expecting 
to receive the services or responses delivered by the use 
cases.) and use cases (i.e., sequences of events by which 
the actors interact with the system’s elements to get their 
job done).  
The actors in the e-catalogue service can be 
categorized into the e-catalogue provider, the content 
provider, and the e-catalogue subscriber. Each role in the 
diagram places a number of requirements for the service 
and those requirements need to be handled by various use 
cases. Those requirements were translated into user cases 
in the use case diagram shown in Fig. 2. E-catalogue 
provider would manage user accounts, manage e-
catalogue requirements, and create/manage the content 
maintainer data. Content provider would create and 
manage e-catalogue contents. E-catalogue subscriber 
would create and manage user accounts, generate and 
submit e-catalogue requirements, and subscribe and 
consume e-catalogues. 
 
4.2. Object modeling and class development 
Based on the use case diagram and the corresponding 
usage scenarios, an object modeling process was 
conducted to derive class diagrams which were 
subsequently used to identify and develop classes/codes. 
The use cases were modeled one at a time by 
investigating each usage scenario and then identifying the 
relevant events and interactions from each use case. Such 
events and interactions were used to define the significant 
classes and the relationships between classes in a 
scenario-oriented modeling approach described by 
Larman [14]. Java technology was used to develop 
classes, such as the classes for supporting the “Create 
Catalogues” use case, which is for generating and 
managing RSS feeds and related content files. Similarly, 
the synchronous communications between users and the 
e-catalogue server for all use cases were implemented by 
using the http request/response model, and the 
asynchronous delivery channels were implemented to 
support various operations involving asynchronous 
communications.

catalogues 
 
4.3. The WBSF based e-catalogue service 
The WBSF based e-catalogue service was deployed 
by using the virtual machine concept to simulate the 
service oriented collaboration environment. Two 
Microsoft Windows machines were physically used in the 
deployment. Three servers including the service broker 
server (SBS), the e-catalogue service server (ESS), and 
the catalogue content server (CCS), were hosted on an 
Intel Core 2 Quad box. The user client (UC) and the 
content provider client (CPC) were hosted by an AMD 
Athlon X2 machine. The role and responsibility of each 
server or client were described in Subsection 3.2 
explaining System Architecture and its components. 
Fig. 3 shows an example of the RSS e-catalogue 
generated by the service. As this code segment shows, 
most of the code is for RSS declarations, and the e-
catalogue content only takes a small portion of the

strength of Web-feed technology to overcome the 
limitations of traditional communication channels and to 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional 
business practice. Considered as a pull mechanism, Web-
feed technology might be used to enhance marketing 
strategy for attracting a niche audience, particularly in the 
event that when traditional marketing approach becomes 
outdated or inconvenient for customers. Our study 
focused on two main concepts, specialization of Web-

Based on WBSF, a sample e-catalogue service was 
designed and implemented by using Web-feeds as 
effective asynchronous communication media to enhance 
the effectiveness and efficiency of business functions. 
As a matter of fact, we are currently working to adapt 
and enhance WBSF for providing valuable Web-feed 
based services to several application domains, including 
marketing [10], m-learning [12], information system 
services [17], tourism services, and other interesting 
areas. The approach of applying WBSF to multiple

during the reading, it can be an annoying and time 
consuming process. Therefore, it was proposed by our 
project to build a new online dictionary service that can 
make the reading process more efficient for its users so 
they can not only read English articles easier but 
understand the content better. 
 
2.2. Web 2.0 
 
The term Web 2.0 was coined in 1999 and started to 
become a common term in 2004 after Tim O’Reilly and 
his colleagues held a Web 2.0 conference and described 
the common features of various web companies that 
survived the “dot–com burst” of the late 1990s [2]. 
O’Reilly stated that “Web 2.0 is the business revolution in 
the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet 
as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for 
success on that new platform” [3]. Indeed, using the 
Internet as a platform would allow users to be not only 
content consumers but also content contributors. This 
collaborative activity has already become one of the core 
characteristics of Web 2.0 services [4]. Web 2.0 thrives 
on network effects: databases that get richer the more 
people interact with them, and applications that are 
smarter the more people use them [5]. 
“Mashup” is also an idea based on Web 2.0 that 
gathers contents or functions from various sources and 
provides a new type of service or content after merging 
them [6]. In a mashup, the web server collects and 
combines needed data or services from more than one 
websites and then compiles them into a single page for 
users. The benefit of mashup is that the data in different 
websites are all separate so they can be assembled and 
reused whenever necessary. Moreover, mashups can save 
time by reducing the work of building a huge database for 
satisfying users’ requirements, mainly because the data is 
gathered from outside. 
 
2.3. Web-feed 
 
A Web-feed is a kind of XML-based data format and 
widely used by websites which continually update their 
content, such as blogs, weather reports and news 
organizations. The webmaster publishes a simple 
computer program known as a "feed" on the website and 
end users link to this feed through an aggregator program 
known as a feed reader or Web-feed reader [7]. After the 
user subscribes to a certain Web-feed, the program may 
automatically check if there is any new content being 
published; therefore, users can receive the latest 
information immediately, without checking the website 
manually and repeatedly. Today, RSS is the most widely 
used feed format [8]. RSS feed technology not only is a 
channel to deliver new content to users, but also engage 
RSS subscribers to discuss and interact in an 
asynchronous pervasive computing environment [9]. 
Moreover, its lightweight transmission is also suitable for 
low-speed connections or low processing devices such as 
cell phones or mobile devices [10]. 
 
2.4. Screen scraping  
 
Screen scraping is the technology of pre-Web 2.0 
eras. In an HTML web page, except the words, photos, or 
videos which are displayed on the screen for users, there 
are many other lines of code which are about setting the 
display format. HTML puts data inside the opening and 
closing markup tags. The functions of markup tags are:  
identifying the structure of the document, and deciding 
the format of how to show data on the screen. In the 
source code of an HTML page, content viewers, such as 
normal users, consider that the only valuable data is the 
information inside the tags, instead of the tags 
themselves. Screen scraping connotes the process by 
which a tool attempts to extract information from the 
content provider by attempting to parse the provider's 
Web pages, which were originally intended for human 
consumption [11]. A handful of mashups use it for data 
acquisition, especially when pulling data from the public 
sectors [12].  
 
3. The design of the Web-feed based 
asynchronous dictionary service 
3.1. Conceptual models 
 
Based on the Web-feed technology, a Web-feed 
based model (see Fig. 1) was proposed by this study for 
solving the problem with the traditional way of looking 
up words in a dictionary, and realizing the idea of sharing 
useful information with others. Using the lightweight RSS 
feed as a media to push the search results to users is more 
convenient to use and easier to access on mobile devices. 
 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual model of Web-feed based 
asynchronous dictionary service. 
 
Actually, using Web-feed architecture has numerous 
advantages. Firstly, it provides a new way for the 
4 
provider side; instead, it uses mashup technique to 
assemble the required information obtained from outside. 
Some well known online dictionary websites were chosen 
as our content providers. Actually, the search replies from 
those online dictionary websites may contain some data 
which is useless, such as advertisements, or the logo of 
their company. Moreover, some of them are animations 
which are written in flash or images; this information 
would increase the size of the web page and lengthen the 
loading time. Therefore, when the system gathers the web 
pages from other websites, it acts as a proxy, eliminating 
the useless information for the user, taking out the needed 
parts, repackaging them into an easily read format, and 
finally sending the result to the client.  
 
4.1. Use case diagram 
 
Based on functionalities, there are three various roles 
that participate in this web-feed based asynchronous 
dictionary service, including service provider, content 
provider and user. The use case diagram of the 
implemented dictionary service is shown in Fig. 2, which 
describes the functional requirement and usage scenarios 
of the service. 
 
 
Figure 2. The use case diagram of the web-feed 
based asynchronous dictionary service. 
 
The service provider takes the responsibility to 
provide management functions such as user and 
document management to the people who utilize this 
system. Though the service provider has to bring the 
content to users according to their requirements, it only 
acts as a bridge to connect with content providers and 
select the data he needs from the content providers. 
Therefore, making a connection between users and 
content providers would be the main task for the service 
provider. Dictionary content management is not the 
burden of his. Instead, it is the content providers’. They 
are fully in charge of their supplied content, including 
removing words or adding words in their dictionary 
database and modifying the content of each word. For the 
user’s part, he can interact with the system by uploading 
documents to the server, registering and having an 
account in this system, and managing his personal 
information. The document would be kept in the system 
for a longer time once the user logged into his account 
and saved the document as what he uploaded. Meanwhile, 
after logging in and uploading the document, it brings out 
a series of related actions, including having the power of 
managing his document and its related webpages by 
adding or deleting other people to share with. On the 
other hand, if the user does not log into the system, he 
cannot have the access controlling power to this file; at 
the same time, the uploaded document and generated web 
pages would be deleted automatically a few days after. 
 
4.2. Class development  
 
Based on the use case diagram and the corresponding 
usage scenarios, an object modeling process was 
conducted to derive class diagrams which were 
subsequently used to identify and develop classes/codes. 
The use cases were modeled one at a time by 
investigating each usage scenario and then identifying the 
relevant events and interactions from each use case. Such 
events and interactions were used to define the significant 
classes and the relationships between classes in a 
scenario-oriented modeling approach described by 
Larman [14]. 
 
4.3. An example of using the dictionary service  
 
The client may use any personal computer or 
handheld mobile device (such as PDA, smart phone or 
iPod) to establish a connection between client and server 
via various communication channels such as an HTTP 
connection or RSS feed. Fig. 3 describes how the users 
may interact with the Web-feed based dictionary service. 
 
 
Figure 3. An example of how user interacts with the 
online dictionary server. 
6 
the Web-feed based asynchronous dictionary service.  
This asynchronous dictionary service provides a new 
way to interact with the online dictionary. Using articles 
as the basic unit of searching is very different from the 
normal way of using a dictionary. Submitting and looking 
up several new words at the same time is a different 
approach which may improve efficiency greatly. For m-
learning, one problem with portable devices is that there 
is a very limited amount of screen space on which to 
display information, and this presents a big challenge for 
interface designers [15]. To solve this problem, the RSS 
feed is used in our Web-feed based dictionary service as a 
channel to deliver the content to users. The RSS reader 
might adjust the display, ensuring the content area would 
not be too wide to read. Actually, our approach supports a 
cross-platform learning environment based on a Web-feed 
architecture. Moreover, the collaborative concept in this 
study gives users a chance to share learning content and 
comments with other people by subscribing to the same 
Web-feed. Although other m-learning platforms may also 
have a sharing function, the learning content produced by 
our system perfectly fits group learning needs, which are 
not easy to achieve in other m-learning platforms. 
All large-scale, multi-user communities and online 
social networks that rely on users to contribute content or 
build services share one property: most users do not 
participate very much. About 90 percents users never 
contribute (only read and observe), 9 percents users 
contribute a little and 1 percent users supply most of the 
content [16]. Users only reading but not contributing can 
become a big problem for online communities, making 
the platform turn out to be an empty case in the end. 
Making it easier to contribute is a way to solve this 
difficulty.  
Our m-learning platform is based on dictionary 
service, and extends it to become an efficient 
collaborative learning environment. Compared to other 
m-learning platforms, there are no fixed roles such as 
learners and tutors here. When a user submits the file to 
the server, he/she just wants to use the dictionary service 
to get the definition, but unconsciously becomes a content 
provider at the same time. It adjusts the traditional 
thinking that the person who wants to publish material on 
the Internet has to be certain it’s correct or he might 
mislead others. Indeed, because of this easy-to-use 
document upload function, anyone can be the person who 
provides learning materials for others, and can also 
choose to act as a material receiver as well.

search techniques and the “mashup” concept not only 
allows users to specify their needs through a simple user 
interface but enables service providers to effectively and 
dynamically aggregate personalized contents according to 
users’ demands. The focus of this study is to design and 
implement an innovative Web-based e-catalogue service 
framework which can support Web application paradigm, 
minimize client-server interaction requirements, offer a 
flexible operation environment, and provide an easy-to-
operate user interface. To achieve this goal, the emerging 
Web-feed technology was adopted in our study to 
facilitate the asynchronous communication between 
clients and the e-catalogue service. Although most Web-
feed audiences may not wish to become Web-feed 
technology experts, they would be inevitably influenced 
by the potential benefits of using Web-feed technology 
for enhancing the quality of their digital lifestyle. Thus, it 
would be quite interesting to describe how Web-feed 
technology can support the proposed e-catalogue service 
in a cost-effective and easy-to-operate way. 
 
2. Research background 
2.1. Electronic catalogues 
An e-catalogue is a tool for displaying product 
information on a computer, and it can be viewed as an 
Internet-based medium with low distribution costs. E-
catalogue content may not only include images, texts, 
audio/video clips, and hyperlinks, but provide electronic 
indexes or search functions to help users search product 
information. Nowadays, e-catalogues are changing from 
marketing tools to multinational sales channels because 
they present information to users and provide platforms 
for interaction, transactions, and real-time support [2].   
Personalization, an important concept in the 
contemporary marketing, can be used by a company to 
cater to customers' unique requirements, particularly for 
enhancing business performance in e-commerce 
environment. In general, personalization can make users 
feel comfortable, build better relationships with 
customers, increase customer satisfaction, and gain 
customer loyalty [6]. User interface is an important 
element in creating personalized e-commerce experience, 
because users would directly operate such interface. 
Consequently, it is expected that applying personalization 
to e-catalogue design containing friendly user interface 
and useful messages can enhance the utilization rate and 
view time, thus creating more chances to make a sale. 
 
2.2. Web 2.0 and Mashup 
The phrase "Web 2.0" was uttered by Tim O'Reilly 
and his colleagues at O'Reilly Media in 2004 to describe 
the common features of various Web companies that 
survived the “dot–com burst” in late 1990s [7]. It was 
stated by Musser and O'Reilly that “Web 2.0 is a set of 
economic, social, and technology trends that collectively 
form the basis for the next generation of the Internet—a 
more mature, distinctive medium characterized by user 
participation, openness, and network effects” [8]. 
“Mashup” is an idea of Web 2.0 about gathering 
contents or functions from various sources and providing 
a new type of service or content after merging them. 
When a service provider composes Web page content that 
comes from at least two different sites, this kind of 
service can be called mashup [9]. The strength of mashup 
is that the data sources used for mashup are independent 
and can be reused. Using mashup can create a new set of 
services to satisfy different requirements.  
 
2.3. Web feed  
A Web-feed can be viewed as a document which 
contains links to the sources of content and usually 
follows the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
standard; it can also be viewed as a data format used to 
provide users with frequently updated content. Web-feed 
architecture would include subscribers and publishers. 
Subscribers request Web-feeds from publishers through 
feed readers which retrieve messages from servers that 
are provided by publishers. If there is something new in 
the subscribed feed when a reader compares the data, the 
feed reader will remind the subscriber to check the new 
information. Some advanced feed readers can even trace 
the content and automatically download the messages for 
the subscribers. The most commonly used Web-feed 
format is Really Simple Syndication (RSS) which allows 
companies or information service providers to easily, 
inexpensively and quickly get their content delivered to 
their clients, business partners, the media, employees, and 
others throughout the World Wide Web [10, 11]. 
Facilitating the distribution of important files or sensitive 
data to remote computers and subsequently to suitable 
handheld devices, RSS feed technology enables not only 
sending unique and customized contents but engaging 
RSS subscribers to discussions and interactions in an 
asynchronous pervasive computing environment [10, 12].  
 
3. The design of the e-catalogue service 
3.1. The Web-feed based SOA framework 
In our research, RSS feed is chosen as an enabling 
technology for supporting the proposed Web-feed Based 
SOA (service oriented architecture) Framework (WBSF). 
Using RSS feed as a medium to deliver e-catalogues can 
push the content to users efficiently and effectively. 
WBSF inherits the advantages of RSS technology from 
other aspects including: high-speed Internet connections 
suitable for downloading large files, the availability of 
digital music player software and weblog software, the 
popularity of digital audio/video devices, and the 
ubiquitous MP3/MP4 formats. 
402
4. The implementation of the service 
WBSF was developed by adopting SOA, Web-feed 
technology, Web 2.0 mashup concept, Web application 
paradigm, and other information and communication 
technologies including object-oriented design and 
pervasive computing. In addition to the required logic for 
user registration, authentication and entitlement, the 
desired e-catalogue service was built on top of WBSF for 
providing various supporting functions and operations 
through various modules, including RSS feed creation 
and management module, synchronous interaction 
module, asynchronous delivery module, personalization 
and customization module, user/group management 
module, reporting module, security management module, 
notification and confirmation module, and software 
download and installation module. The overall 
development efforts can be divided into the use case 
development, object modeling and class development 
processes described as follows. 
 
4.1. Use case development  
Use case diagram, which is one of the key diagrams 
of Unified Modeling Language (UML), can describe the 
intended functions of the system and provide input to 
identify roles and deliverables in the organizations [13]. 
Specifically, a use case diagram consists of actors (i.e., 
the units or people in the organization that are expecting 
to receive the services or responses delivered by the use 
cases.) and use cases (i.e., sequences of events by which 
the actors interact with the system’s elements to get their 
job done).  
The actors in the e-catalogue service can be 
categorized into the e-catalogue provider, the content 
provider, and the e-catalogue subscriber. Each role in the 
diagram places a number of requirements for the service 
and those requirements need to be handled by various use 
cases. Those requirements were translated into user cases 
in the use case diagram shown in Fig. 2. E-catalogue 
provider would manage user accounts, manage e-
catalogue requirements, and create/manage the content 
maintainer data. Content provider would create and 
manage e-catalogue contents. E-catalogue subscriber 
would create and manage user accounts, generate and 
submit e-catalogue requirements, and subscribe and 
consume e-catalogues. 
 
4.2. Object modeling and class development 
Based on the use case diagram and the corresponding 
usage scenarios, an object modeling process was 
conducted to derive class diagrams which were 
subsequently used to identify and develop classes/codes. 
The use cases were modeled one at a time by 
investigating each usage scenario and then identifying the 
relevant events and interactions from each use case. Such 
events and interactions were used to define the significant 
classes and the relationships between classes in a 
scenario-oriented modeling approach described by 
Larman [14]. Java technology was used to develop 
classes, such as the classes for supporting the “Create 
Catalogues” use case, which is for generating and 
managing RSS feeds and related content files. Similarly, 
the synchronous communications between users and the 
e-catalogue server for all use cases were implemented by 
using the http request/response model, and the 
asynchronous delivery channels were implemented to 
support various operations involving asynchronous 
communications.  
 
 
Figure 2. Use case diagram for the WBSF based e-
catalogues 
 
4.3. The WBSF based e-catalogue service 
The WBSF based e-catalogue service was deployed 
by using the virtual machine concept to simulate the 
service oriented collaboration environment. Two 
Microsoft Windows machines were physically used in the 
deployment. Three servers including the service broker 
server (SBS), the e-catalogue service server (ESS), and 
the catalogue content server (CCS), were hosted on an 
Intel Core 2 Quad box. The user client (UC) and the 
content provider client (CPC) were hosted by an AMD 
Athlon X2 machine. The role and responsibility of each 
server or client were described in Subsection 3.2 
explaining System Architecture and its components. 
Fig. 3 shows an example of the RSS e-catalogue 
generated by the service. As this code segment shows, 
most of the code is for RSS declarations, and the e-
catalogue content only takes a small portion of the 
document. Technically, ESS must dynamically convert 
the data in SOAP format into RSS format. Fig. 4 shows 
an example of viewing an RSS e-catalogue in Microsoft 
Internet Explorer 7. The layout in Fig. 4 may look 
404
framework (WBSF) for taking advantage of the unique 
strength of Web-feed technology to overcome the 
limitations of traditional communication channels and to 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional 
business practice. Considered as a pull mechanism, Web-
feed technology might be used to enhance marketing 
strategy for attracting a niche audience, particularly in the 
event that when traditional marketing approach becomes 
outdated or inconvenient for customers. Our study 
focused on two main concepts, specialization of Web-
feed content and targeted communications, by probing the 
ways of utilizing Web-feed to reach determined target 
groups with suitable one-to-one, one-to-few or one-to-
many contents customized for various targeted groups. 
Based on WBSF, a sample e-catalogue service was 
designed and implemented by using Web-feeds as 
effective asynchronous communication media to enhance 
the effectiveness and efficiency of business functions. 
As a matter of fact, we are currently working to adapt 
and enhance WBSF for providing valuable Web-feed 
based services to several application domains, including 
marketing [10], m-learning [12], information system 
services [17], tourism services, and other interesting 
areas. The approach of applying WBSF to multiple 
application domains is extremely important for a better 
understanding of designing, refining, and enhancing the 
proposed Web-feed based architecture. Every 
technological environment and its application systems in 
a given domain have their specific attributes which 
require not only the use of general design principles but 
the discovery of new specific principles. Web-feed is a 
new technological arena with many exciting technologies 
and vast application potentials. Research into the design 
of useable systems is likely not only to widen the scope of 
its practical application but to contribute to developing a 
design theory for Web-feed based applications.

during the reading, it can be an annoying and time 
consuming process. Therefore, it was proposed by our 
project to build a new online dictionary service that can 
make the reading process more efficient for its users so 
they can not only read English articles easier but 
understand the content better. 
 
2.2. Web 2.0 
 
The term Web 2.0 was coined in 1999 and started to 
become a common term in 2004 after Tim O’Reilly and 
his colleagues held a Web 2.0 conference and described 
the common features of various web companies that 
survived the “dot–com burst” of the late 1990s [2]. 
O’Reilly stated that “Web 2.0 is the business revolution in 
the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet 
as platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for 
success on that new platform” [3]. Indeed, using the 
Internet as a platform would allow users to be not only 
content consumers but also content contributors. This 
collaborative activity has already become one of the core 
characteristics of Web 2.0 services [4]. Web 2.0 thrives 
on network effects: databases that get richer the more 
people interact with them, and applications that are 
smarter the more people use them [5]. 
“Mashup” is also an idea based on Web 2.0 that 
gathers contents or functions from various sources and 
provides a new type of service or content after merging 
them [6]. In a mashup, the web server collects and 
combines needed data or services from more than one 
websites and then compiles them into a single page for 
users. The benefit of mashup is that the data in different 
websites are all separate so they can be assembled and 
reused whenever necessary. Moreover, mashups can save 
time by reducing the work of building a huge database for 
satisfying users’ requirements, mainly because the data is 
gathered from outside. 
 
2.3. Web-feed 
 
A Web-feed is a kind of XML-based data format and 
widely used by websites which continually update their 
content, such as blogs, weather reports and news 
organizations. The webmaster publishes a simple 
computer program known as a "feed" on the website and 
end users link to this feed through an aggregator program 
known as a feed reader or Web-feed reader [7]. After the 
user subscribes to a certain Web-feed, the program may 
automatically check if there is any new content being 
published; therefore, users can receive the latest 
information immediately, without checking the website 
manually and repeatedly. Today, RSS is the most widely 
used feed format [8]. RSS feed technology not only is a 
channel to deliver new content to users, but also engage 
RSS subscribers to discuss and interact in an 
asynchronous pervasive computing environment [9]. 
Moreover, its lightweight transmission is also suitable for 
low-speed connections or low processing devices such as 
cell phones or mobile devices [10]. 
 
2.4. Screen scraping  
 
Screen scraping is the technology of pre-Web 2.0 
eras. In an HTML web page, except the words, photos, or 
videos which are displayed on the screen for users, there 
are many other lines of code which are about setting the 
display format. HTML puts data inside the opening and 
closing markup tags. The functions of markup tags are:  
identifying the structure of the document, and deciding 
the format of how to show data on the screen. In the 
source code of an HTML page, content viewers, such as 
normal users, consider that the only valuable data is the 
information inside the tags, instead of the tags 
themselves. Screen scraping connotes the process by 
which a tool attempts to extract information from the 
content provider by attempting to parse the provider's 
Web pages, which were originally intended for human 
consumption [11]. A handful of mashups use it for data 
acquisition, especially when pulling data from the public 
sectors [12].  
 
3. The design of the Web-feed based 
asynchronous dictionary service 
3.1. Conceptual models 
 
Based on the Web-feed technology, a Web-feed 
based model (see Fig. 1) was proposed by this study for 
solving the problem with the traditional way of looking 
up words in a dictionary, and realizing the idea of sharing 
useful information with others. Using the lightweight RSS 
feed as a media to push the search results to users is more 
convenient to use and easier to access on mobile devices. 
 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual model of Web-feed based 
asynchronous dictionary service. 
 
Actually, using Web-feed architecture has numerous 
advantages. Firstly, it provides a new way for the 
408
provider side; instead, it uses mashup technique to 
assemble the required information obtained from outside. 
Some well known online dictionary websites were chosen 
as our content providers. Actually, the search replies from 
those online dictionary websites may contain some data 
which is useless, such as advertisements, or the logo of 
their company. Moreover, some of them are animations 
which are written in flash or images; this information 
would increase the size of the web page and lengthen the 
loading time. Therefore, when the system gathers the web 
pages from other websites, it acts as a proxy, eliminating 
the useless information for the user, taking out the needed 
parts, repackaging them into an easily read format, and 
finally sending the result to the client.  
 
4.1. Use case diagram 
 
Based on functionalities, there are three various roles 
that participate in this web-feed based asynchronous 
dictionary service, including service provider, content 
provider and user. The use case diagram of the 
implemented dictionary service is shown in Fig. 2, which 
describes the functional requirement and usage scenarios 
of the service. 
 
 
Figure 2. The use case diagram of the web-feed 
based asynchronous dictionary service. 
 
The service provider takes the responsibility to 
provide management functions such as user and 
document management to the people who utilize this 
system. Though the service provider has to bring the 
content to users according to their requirements, it only 
acts as a bridge to connect with content providers and 
select the data he needs from the content providers. 
Therefore, making a connection between users and 
content providers would be the main task for the service 
provider. Dictionary content management is not the 
burden of his. Instead, it is the content providers’. They 
are fully in charge of their supplied content, including 
removing words or adding words in their dictionary 
database and modifying the content of each word. For the 
user’s part, he can interact with the system by uploading 
documents to the server, registering and having an 
account in this system, and managing his personal 
information. The document would be kept in the system 
for a longer time once the user logged into his account 
and saved the document as what he uploaded. Meanwhile, 
after logging in and uploading the document, it brings out 
a series of related actions, including having the power of 
managing his document and its related webpages by 
adding or deleting other people to share with. On the 
other hand, if the user does not log into the system, he 
cannot have the access controlling power to this file; at 
the same time, the uploaded document and generated web 
pages would be deleted automatically a few days after. 
 
4.2. Class development  
 
Based on the use case diagram and the corresponding 
usage scenarios, an object modeling process was 
conducted to derive class diagrams which were 
subsequently used to identify and develop classes/codes. 
The use cases were modeled one at a time by 
investigating each usage scenario and then identifying the 
relevant events and interactions from each use case. Such 
events and interactions were used to define the significant 
classes and the relationships between classes in a 
scenario-oriented modeling approach described by 
Larman [14]. 
 
4.3. An example of using the dictionary service  
 
The client may use any personal computer or 
handheld mobile device (such as PDA, smart phone or 
iPod) to establish a connection between client and server 
via various communication channels such as an HTTP 
connection or RSS feed. Fig. 3 describes how the users 
may interact with the Web-feed based dictionary service.

the Web-feed based asynchronous dictionary service.  
This asynchronous dictionary service provides a new 
way to interact with the online dictionary. Using articles 
as the basic unit of searching is very different from the 
normal way of using a dictionary. Submitting and looking 
up several new words at the same time is a different 
approach which may improve efficiency greatly. For m-
learning, one problem with portable devices is that there 
is a very limited amount of screen space on which to 
display information, and this presents a big challenge for 
interface designers [15]. To solve this problem, the RSS 
feed is used in our Web-feed based dictionary service as a 
channel to deliver the content to users. The RSS reader 
might adjust the display, ensuring the content area would 
not be too wide to read. Actually, our approach supports a 
cross-platform learning environment based on a Web-feed 
architecture. Moreover, the collaborative concept in this 
study gives users a chance to share learning content and 
comments with other people by subscribing to the same 
Web-feed. Although other m-learning platforms may also 
have a sharing function, the learning content produced by 
our system perfectly fits group learning needs, which are 
not easy to achieve in other m-learning platforms. 
All large-scale, multi-user communities and online 
social networks that rely on users to contribute content or 
build services share one property: most users do not 
participate very much. About 90 percents users never 
contribute (only read and observe), 9 percents users 
contribute a little and 1 percent users supply most of the 
content [16]. Users only reading but not contributing can 
become a big problem for online communities, making 
the platform turn out to be an empty case in the end. 
Making it easier to contribute is a way to solve this 
difficulty.  
Our m-learning platform is based on dictionary 
service, and extends it to become an efficient 
collaborative learning environment. Compared to other 
m-learning platforms, there are no fixed roles such as 
learners and tutors here. When a user submits the file to 
the server, he/she just wants to use the dictionary service 
to get the definition, but unconsciously becomes a content 
provider at the same time. It adjusts the traditional 
thinking that the person who wants to publish material on 
the Internet has to be certain it’s correct or he might 
mislead others. Indeed, because of this easy-to-use 
document upload function, anyone can be the person who 
provides learning materials for others, and can also 
choose to act as a material receiver as well.
