2found 21  double roots of three-shock
solutions of steady MR are verified and analyzed
in both perfect diatomic and triatomic gases [4-6].
As noted in [6], the defined problem of von
Neumann paradox of weak pseudo-steady MR is
incorrect. It is not the apparent persistence of
MR into regions of parameter space ( wsM , ),
for which the three-shock theory has no
physically realistic solutions. It is the remarkably
large discrepancies between experiments and
predictions obtained from both local and global
three-shock theories of pseudo-steady MR, This
fact is again explained and illustrated in Figs 1 &
2 using two cases of studied pseudo-steady MR
of sM =1.035,  6.9w , 667.1
(numerically and experimentally studied in [7]
and sM =1.47, 20w , 667.1
(numerically studied by Vasil’ev and Kraiko [8]
with obtained  2.12 ). Commonly accepted
notions of  ‘von Neumann paradox’of weak
shock reflection is this : A (perfect-gas
three-shock) theoretical analysis implies that a
standard triple-point configuration, in which
three plane shocks and a plane contact
discontinuity separated by constant states meet a
point, is impossible for sufficient weak shocks;
yet experiments of the irregular reflection of a
weak shock off a wedge do show that a reflection
pattern closely resembling a single Mach
reflection with a triple-point [e.g. 7.9] exist. The
most frequently referred theoretical analysis is
Henderson’s 1987 work [10] in pseudo-steady
flow, which is based on his 1964 paper [11] on
the confluence of three shock waves in steady
perfect gases. Colella and Henderson [7]
provided the following statement : the apparent
persistence of MR into regions of parameter
space (, wsM , ), for which the theory has no
physically realistic solutions is defined to be this
‘von Neumann paradox’. In fact they [7] stated
that it is impossible to calculate  (triple-point
trajectory angle) from the inviscid three-shock
theory of weak MR in order to compare with
their weak MR experiments in argon of
47.1sM series (  58.14w ? 30.19 ? 27.29 )
and 035.1sM series. So they calculated the
wave angles between the incident shock and
slipstream and those between the Mach stem and
slipstream to allow comparisons between the
experiments and predictions from the three-shock
theory.
However, as shown in Figs. 1 & 2, it is clear
that both the global and local three-shock
theoretical solutions of these two pseudo-steady
MR exist! The calculated s' obtained from the
(global) three-shock theory is  48.28 and
47.17 , respectively. Thus, the discrepancies
between the experiments (given in the figures)
and the theories are remarkably large. The local
three-shock theoretical solutions using
experimentally and numerically observed s'
are presented in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2(b),
respectively. It is important to note that the
sought 1 intersection solutions between the
incident and reflected shock polars fall beneath
the 2D point (i.e. 2P , 3P < 1P ) for both local
cases. The computed pressures, Mach nos., wave
and deflection angles of states “2”and “3”are
listed in the figures. Actually, these two local
solutions require the reflected wave to be an
expansion shock! Unfortunately, Colella and
Henderson [7] did not give any other
experimental data for their experiment. Vasil’ev
and Kraiko [8] provided their numerically
obtained  585.1012 . Thus, the large
discrepancies between the experiments and
4MR at different sM '0
Searching for the exact location of the jump
of the 21  double-root on the ( 01 M )
plane are carried out by systematically examining
multiply possible theoretical solutions at
different sM '0 by varying 1 from upper
forbidden sonic conditions to their minimum
incident Mach angle conditions. Five series of
steady MR solutions of 0M =1.4, 2.27, 2.2732,
2.3 and 5.0 are reported in this work, given in
Figs. 5-9. Initial conditions of 01 / PP , 1 are
given in all ( P ) shock polar solution
diagrams. As noted in [6], the computed results
illustrating in Figs. 5-9 are self-explanatory. In
particular, solutions of the upper sonic forbidden
condition marked as 11 M , 12 D , marked as
Triple-root (I), 12 D as Triple-root (I) or (II),
22 D as Triple-root (II). Solutions of forward-
or backward-strong/weak separating, forward- or
backward- sonic, forward/backward separating,
von Neumann condition, limiting incident shock
Mach angle condition, 21  , 21  are
correspondingly marked in Figs. 5-9. Therefore,
only brief descriptions regarding main features of
three multiply possible theoretical solutions are
provided for 0M 1.4, 2.27, 2.3, and 5.0.
Detailed discussions on behaviors of theoretical
three-shock 1 , 1and 2 solutions are given
for 2732.20 M , where the jump in 21  is
located.
Sequential shock polar solutions of steady
MR of 0M 1.4 are shown in Fig. 5. It can be
seen that the 1 solution moves from locations
beneath 2D towards those on the
backward-facing branch of the reflected shock
polar. 21  double roots do not exist for
0M 1.4. Figures 6 and 8 give systematic shock
polar solutions of steady MR for 0M =2.27 and
3.20 M , respectively. Steady MR solutions of
0M =2.2732, where 21  jump is located, is
then discussed. There are similarities and
differences in these theoretical MR solutions
between 0M =2.27 and 0M =2.3. Similarities are
1 locations of the solutions of triple-root (I)
and (II), forward/backward separating, forward-
or backward- sonic and von Neumann condition.
Significant differences however are 1
locations of the solutions of 21  double
roots. Particularly, 21  double roots, which
occur twice in 0M =2.3, do not exist in
0M =2.27.
The reason of the apparently large
difference in 1 location of 21  double
roots for such narrow variation in 0M and the
origin of the occurrence of 21   double roots
can be clarified when one compares theoretical
MR solutions of 0M 2.27 and 2.3 with those
of 2732.20 M (given in Fig. 7). The critical
condition for occurring the jump in 21 
double roots is found to be the 211  
triple-root condition at 2732.20 M ,
 239.291 , shown in Fig. 7(b). One observes
that the 1 solutions cease to becoming
physically realistic, for they are unable to move
above 2D for 2732.20 M . After the
occurrence of the triple roots 211   , 1
and 2 disappear immediately, and the 1
solution moves towards the backward-facing
branch of the reflected shock polars. As for the
various specific MR solutions (e.g. triple-root,
forward/backward separating etc), they are
marked in Fig. 7. It is worth mentioning that
there exists cases of m (the number of physically
significant three-shock solutions of steady MR) =
3 between cases (f) and (g) for 27.20 M ,
between cases (h) and (i) for 2732.20 M ,
