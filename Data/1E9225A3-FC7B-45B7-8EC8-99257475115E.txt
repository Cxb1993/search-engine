英文摘要
In this project, the performance of an InGaP/GaAs superlattice-emitter bipolar transistor with
InGaAs/GaAs superlattice-base structure is demonstrated by experimental results. The injecting
electrons from superlattice emitter are easy to transport into the superlattice-base region for
promoting the collector current by tunneling behavior. Furthermore, the average energy gap of base
regime is substantially reduced by the use of InGaAs/GaAs superlattice structure for the requirement
of low turn-on voltage. Experimentally, the transistor exhibits a maximum common-emitter current
gain of 295 and a relatively low collector-emitter offset voltage of only 16 mV. In particular, the
ideality factor of collector current near to unity is obtained. Consequently, the proposed device
provides good potential for linear amplifier and low-power circuit application.

結果與討論
The corresponding energy band diagrams near B-E junction under forward bias is illustrated in
Fig. 2. In the device, the B-E interface behaviors as homojunction and the potential spike at B-E
junction can be eliminated for the requirement of low offset voltage and high current gain at low
current level, due to the addition of a small-energy n-GaAs layer between InGaP/GaAs superlattice
emitter and InGaAs/GaAs superlattice base. Because the n-GaAs layer is thin, the superlattice
emitter is completely depleted at low B-E voltage level and it could maintain the confinement effect
for holes by the large valence band discontinuity (Ev) at InGaP/GaAs heterojunction, Once the
applied VBE is enough large, the depletion thickness at B-E junction reduces and the neutral
superlattice emitter appears. The electrons transport across the superlattice emitter part by the
resonant-tunneling injection, which could substantially decrease the neutral-emitter recombination
within the n-GaAs layer. It is worthy to note that the tunneling electrons from InGaP/GaAs
superlattice emitter will transport over the n-GaAs layer and easily enter the InGaAs/GaAs
superlattice-base region, as shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 3 depicts the Gummel plots of the studied device at VBC = 0 V. The B-E turn-on voltage
is only 0.95 V at the current level of 1 A, which is more lower than the traditional InGaP/GaAs
HEBT with the same base doping concentration [4]. The low turn-on voltage can reduce the

The dependence of current gain on the collector current at VBC = 0 is revealed in Fig. 4. Based
on the reduction of potential spike at the E-B junction, a high current gain is observed at low current
level. The transistor exhibits a maximum common-emitter current gain as high as 295, which is
larger than the previous HEBT [4]. Furthermore, a current gain greater than 200 is obtained when
collector current above 3.5 mA. The device also shows excellent performance including higher
current gain and lower offset voltage than the conventional InGaP/GaAs tunneling HBT [12]. Thus,
the studied device exhibiting high device linearity, i.e., current gain versus collector current IC, is
proper for linear amplifier applications.
結論
In conclusion, a high-performance InGaP/GaAs superlattice-emitter bipolar transistor with
InGaAs/GaAs superlattice-base structure is investigated. The n-GaAs layer between B-E junction
helps to eliminate the potential spike, and superlattice-emitter structure is used to reduce the
influence of neutral-emitter recombination current in the n-GaAs region under large B-E bias. On
the other hand, the electrons from the superlattice emitter are easy to travel into the superlattice base
by tunneling behavior. As compared with the traditional InGaP/GaAs HEBT, the studied device
exhibits excellent device performance. Consequently, the proposed device provides good potential
for linear amplifier and low-power circuit application.

Abstract- In this article, the performance of a novel 
InGaP/GaAs superlattice-emitter bipolar transistor with 
InGaAs/GaAs superlattice-base structure is demonstrated by 
experimental results. The injecting electrons from superlattice

promoting the collector current by tunneling behavior. 
Furthermore, the average energy gap of base regime is 
substantially reduced by the use of InGaAs/GaAs superlattice 
structure for the requirement of low turn-on voltage. 
Experimentally, the transistor exhibits a maximum common-
emitter current gain of 295 and a relatively low collector-emitter 
voltage of only 16 mV. In particular, the ideality factor of 
collector current near to unity is obtained. Based on the excellent 
transistor performance, the studied can provide a promise for 
signal amplifier and low-power circuit applications.  
I. INTRODUCTION
Heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) have attracted 
significant interest for high-speed digital and microwave 
circuit applications. However, the conventional HBTs suffered 
from a large collector-emitter offset voltage (VCE) resulting 
from the difference between base-emitter (B-E) and base-
collector turn-on voltages, which severely limits the minimum 
operated voltage and causes the high power consumption in 
circuit applications [1]. It is well known that two usual 
approaches, i.e., the reduction of potential spike at B-E 
junction [2-4] and the employment of a small energy-gap layer 
as base material [5-7], had been employed for the reduction of 
B-E turn-on voltage.  
Over the past years, heterostructure-emitter bipolar 
transistor (HEBTs) with B-E homojunction [2-4], have been 
demonstrated to reduce the potential spike at B-E junction. 
Nevertheless, the thickness of the small energy-gap emitter 
layer is critical to determine the device performance. The 
transistor will act with inferior confinement effect for holes 
and cause the large charge storage in neutral-emitter region 
when the layer is too thick, while the undesirable offset 
voltage is still considerably large when the layer is too thin [3]. 
The second approach to improve the turn-on voltage is to 
adopt small energy-gap InGaAs ternary alloys as base layer 
for the GaAs-based HBTs. Nevertheless, it will introduce 
compressive strain due to a lattice mismatch with GaAs 
material and the base layer thickness is severely limited [5]. 
Furthermore, the use of the InxGa1-xAs1-yNy as base layer was 
well demonstrated to further reduce the energy gap of base 
and it effectively improved the problem associated with excess 
strain [6]. But, the quaternary alloys increase the epitaxy 
complexity. With respect with the strain problem, the lattice 
mismatch is accommodated by uniform stains in the layer for 
the strained-layer superlattice (SLP) [8]. No or few misfit 
dislocations are formed at the interfaces and high-quality 
crystalline materials can be obtained. In 1989, R. Grey et al. 
had demonstrated experimentally the long-period 
InGaAs/GaAs SLP grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) 
[9]. In the structure, the thickness of In0.24Ga0.76As wells was 
130 Å, while the thickness of GaAs barriers were 30, 130, and 
up 400 Å. The total thickness of the superlattice reached to 
1m. Also, the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) 
photodetector on an InxGa1xAs/GaAs SLP by MBE was 
investigated by M. Zirngibl et al. in 1991 [10]. The 120-period 
superlattices consisted of 6 nm GaAs and 6~8 nm InxGa1xAs 
with InAs content x between 48% and 66%. Photodetector 
performance including relatively low dark currents and 
excellent spectral responses were depicted.  
In this article, an InGaP/GaAs superlattic-emitter bipolar 
transistor with InGaAs/GaAs superlattice base structure is 
first fabricated and experimentally demonstrated. The 
tunneling mechanism is formed in superlattice emitter together 
with superlattice-base region to achieve low offset voltage, 
low turn-on voltage, and high current gain, simultaneously. 
II. EXPERIMENTS
The structure layers were grown on an (100)-oriented semi-
insulating GaAs substrate by MBE system. A 0.5 m n+ = 1 × 
1019 cm3 GaAs subcollector layer was first grown followed 
by a 0.5 m n+ = 1 × 1019 cm3 GaAs subcollector layer, a 
0.5 m n = 5 × 1016 cm3 GaAs collector layer, a p+ = 5 × 
1018 cm3 InGaAs/GaAs superlattice base, a 300 Åʳ n = 5 × 
1017 cm3 GaAs layer, an n = 5 × 1017 cm3 In0.49Ga0.51P/GaAs 
superlattice emitter. Finally, a 0.3 m n+ = 1 × 1019 cm3 GaAs 
cap layer was deposited on the superlattice emitter. The 
superlattice base consists of ten-period 50 Å In0.15Ga0.85As
layers and nine-period 50 Å GaAs layers, while superlattice 
emitter includes five-period 50 Å In0.49Ga0.51P layers and four-
period 50 Å GaAs layers. After the epitaxial growth, the 
conventional photolithography, vacuum evaporation and wet 
selective etching processes were used to fabricate the device. 
AuGeNi and AuZn metals were employed as n- and p-type 
ohmic contacts, respectively. The emitter area is 50 × 50 m2.

The dependence of current gain on the collector current at 
VBC = 0 is shown in Fig. 4. Based on the reduction of potential 
spike at the E-B junction, a high current gain is observed at 
low current level. The transistor exhibits a maximum 
common-emitter current gain  as high as 295, which is more 
larger than the previous HEBT [4]. Furthermore, a current 
gain greater than 200 is obtained when collector current above 
3.5 mA. Thus, the studied device exhibiting high device 
linearity, i.e., current gain  versus collector current IC, is 
proper for linear amplifier applications.  
IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, a newly designed InGaP/GaAs superlattice-
emitter bipolar transistor with InGaAs/GaAs superlattice-base 
structure is investigated. The n-GaAs layer between B-E 
junction helps to eliminate the potential spike, and 
superlattice-emitter structure is used to reduce the influence of 
neutral-emitter recombination current in the n-GaAs region 
under large B-E bias. On the other hand, the electrons from 
the superlattice emitter are easy to travel into the superlattice 
base by tunneling behavior. As compared with the traditional 
InGaP/GaAs HEBT, the studied device exhibits excellent 
device performance. Consequently, the proposed device 
provides good potential for linear amplifier and low-power 
circuit application.
