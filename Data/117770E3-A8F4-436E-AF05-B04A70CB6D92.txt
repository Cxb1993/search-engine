the effect of field plates to increase the breakdown voltage, the linearity characteristics of 
field-plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT structure are investigated in this project. 
 
Device Fabrication 
AlGaN/GaN HEMT epitaxy structure in this study was grown on sapphire by metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition system. The structure included 3μm un-doped GaN buffer and 30nm 
un-doped Al0.25Ga0.75N. The Hall mobility and sheet carrier concentration were 1300 cm2/V-s and 
1×1013 cm-2, respectively. Fig.1 shows the schematic cross-section of field-plated AlGaN/GaN 
HEMT. Mesa etching was performed by ICP-RIE etching with Cl2/BCl3 gas mixture. Ohmic alloy 
Ti/Al/Ni/Au was deposited by e-beam evaporator and annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 800℃ 
for 60 seconds. The spacing between source and drain was 7μm. The ohmic contact resistance was 
3×10-6 ohm-cm2. Ni/Au was used as the gate metal and was formed by e-beam evaporator. 100nm 
SiNx grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition was used as passivation layer. Finally, 
Ti/Au was deposited as the 2μm field plate structure, which was connected to the gate electrode. 
The gate length was 1μm, and the gate width was 100μm with each gate finger width of 50μm. In 
this study, both filed-plated (FP) and non-field-plated (nFP) AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were fabricated 
to investigate the effect of field plate structure on the linearity characteristics of GaN devices for 
microwave applications.  Figure 2 shows the designed mask layout together with the SEM image 
of the fabricated airbridge structure.  Note that in the device layout, since we are dealing with a 
large number fingers, proper design of the traces connecting the gate and drain fingers is 
extremely important.  Full-wave electromagnetic simulations on these traces have been 
performed to make sure that the phase difference in between any two fingers is minimized.  This 
is essential for best power combining efficiency.  Additionally, short gate width structure was 
used such that the heat can be effectively dissipated so the unwanted oscillation would not occur.

C.RF Power Performance 
The power performance was measured using FOCUS on-wafer load-pull system. Fig. 7 shows the 
source and load contour on the Smith Chart.  The devices were tuning for the maximum output 
power, and output power and gain are plotted as functions of input power at 2 GHz in Fig. 8. 
When biased at drain voltage of 30V with drain current of 15mA/mm, FP and nFP-HEMT 
obtained output power of 25.36dBm and 22.49dBm, respectively. Even FP-HEMT showed lower 
linear gain of 15.39dB, the device still has higher output power and power added efficiency than 
those of nFP-HEMT at high input level, which was benefited from better surface state 
suppression.

Conclusions 
In this study, field-plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT device has been fabricated and characterized. 
Measurement results revealed an output power of 25.36dBm with linear gain of 15.39dB at 2GHz 
for FP-HEMT when biased at Vds = 30V. Even lower Gm was observed, FP-HEMT still exhibited 
improved linearity characteristics for IMD3 and ACPR measurements. When biased at 30V, 
FP-HEMT showed -27.1dBc for IMD3 data and -33.88dBc for ACPR data. These results indicate 
that even the field plate structure resulted in some undesired characteristics, such as lower Gm and 
gain, FP-HEMT still showed higher output power and good linearity results for IMD3 and ACPR 
measurements. These results demonstrate that FP-HEMTs are suitable for high linearity  
microwave applications.

A field-plated (FP) AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) was fabricated. Investigations on the linearity characteristics were
performed through two-tone and wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA) modulated excitations. The FP-HEMT exhibited an improved
breakdown voltage of 160V compared with that of the conventional HEMT. Additionally, a higher output power of 25.4 dBm with 43% power added
efficiency at a 30V drain bias at 2GHz was achieved. When biased at 30V and 15mA/mm current density, the third-order intermodulation (IM3)
level was measured to be 27:1 dBc (at P1dB) and the adjacent channel power rejection (ACPR) was 33:8 dBc (at P1dB) under WCDMA
modulation at 2GHz. Measurement results revealed that the field-plated structure improved the linearity performance over the conventional
structure at high output power levels even beyond P1dB. # 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

1. Introduction
Modern wireless communication systems have put extreme-
ly stringent requirements on both the power and linearity
performance of power ampliﬁers for base stations operating
at microwave frequencies. Silicon laterally diﬀused metal
oxide semiconductor (LDMOS) power transistors have been
dominant for such applications over the years. However,
with the approaching limits of operability for such devices,
there will be a need for other semiconductor materials to
fulﬁll the high-power and high-linearity requirements of the
next generation wireless technology. Gallium nitride (GaN)
has been acknowledged as a prime candidate for high-power
microwave applications owing to their high breakdown
ﬁeld (3MV/cm), high electron saturation velocity (2:5
107 cm2 V1 s1), and high operating temperature.1) The
associated AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor
(HEMT) structure further features relatively high electron
mobility due to the existence of two-dimensional electron
gases (2DEGs). Such superior electronic properties of the
structure have generated record-high output power densities
at S- and X-bands.2,3)
Recently, a ﬁeld plate structure has been widely used in
AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for power application. It was believed
that the ﬁeld plate cannot only enhance breakdown voltage
but also suppress the surface state, which markedly aﬀected
the power performance of GaN HEMTs.4,5) The eﬀects of
insulator thickness and geometry of the ﬁeld plate on
breakdown voltage and frequency response were dis-
cussed.4,6,7) Meanwhile, the extension gate of the ﬁeld plate
increases the gate capacitance (Cgd) and results in degraded
transconductance and gain characteristics. While studies
have been focused on the eﬀect of ﬁeld plates to increase the
breakdown voltage, not much research eﬀort has been
devoted to the linearity performance of the ﬁeld-plated (FP)
AlGaN/GaN HEMT.7,8) Thus, the main focus of this study
is the investigation of the linearity characteristics of an FP-
HEMT under diﬀerent bias conditions.
2. Experimental Methods
The AlGaN/GaN HEMT epitaxy structure in this study
was grown on sapphire by metal organic chemical vapor
deposition. The structure included 3-mm-thick undoped GaN
buﬀer and 30-nm-thick undoped Al0:25Ga0:75N layers. The
Hall mobility and sheet carrier concentration were 1300
cm2 V1 s1 and 1 1013 cm2, respectively. Figure 1
shows a schematic cross section of the ﬁeld-plated
AlGaN/GaN HEMT. Mesa etching was performed by ICP-
RIE with a Cl2/BCl3 gas mixture. Ohmic alloy Ti/Al/Ni/
Au was deposited by e-beam evaporation and annealed in
nitrogen atmosphere at 800 C for 60 s. The spacing between
source and drain was 7 mm. The ohmic contact resistance
was 3 106  cm2. After ohmic formation, the sample was
dipped in dilute HCl for 1min for cleaning. After cleaning,
a Ni/Au gate (Lg ¼ 1 mm) was deposited and subsequently
the device was passivated with a 100-nm-thick SiNx layer
grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.
Finally, Ti/Au was deposited as the ﬁeld plate structure
(LFP ¼ 1 mm), which was connected to the gate electrode.
The device was 100 mm FET with gate ﬁnger widths of
50 mm. In this study, both FP and non-FP (nFP) AlGaN/GaN
HEMTs were fabricated to observe the eﬀect of the ﬁeld
plate structure on the linearity characteristics for microwave
applications.

opt ¼ 0:886=9:9 and 0:885=7:5 for FP and nFP devices,
respectively. A higher output power of 25.36 dBm and PAE
of 43% were achieved for the FP device. Meanwhile, P1 dB
for the FP and nFP devices when biased at a 30V drain bias
were 18.52 and 16.26 dBm, respectively. The softer gain
compression of the FP device is believed to be the reason for
the linearity improvement at high output power levels even
beyond P1 dB. Such superior performance is mainly attrib-
uted to the reduction of trapping in surface states due to the
ﬁeld plate structure.4)
3.4 Linearity measurements
For linearity characterization, both two-tone and digitally
modulated W-CDMA signals were used as excitation for
third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) and adjacent
channel power ratio (ACPR) measurement, respectively. The
load impedances were set at maximum output power for
both measurements. The two carriers were set at a center
frequency of 2GHz with 1MHz apart for IMD3 measure-
ment. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the measured IMD3 as a
function of power back-oﬀ from P1 dB biased at VDS ¼ 20
and 30V with a 15mA/mm current density for the FP
and nFP devices. It is clear that both devices exhibited
comparable performance with slight improvement observed
for the FP device. This improvement in IMD3 is related to
the soft gain compression of the FP device caused by
the ﬁeld plate. Generally, soft gain compression tends to
suppress the AM-AM distortion at the same output power
level. Thus, the reduction of surface state trapping through
the application of the ﬁeld plate will result in soft gain
compression and thus better IMD3 performance as observed
from the measurement.
To further characterize the device performance under
digitally modulated excitation, we used a wide band code
division multiple access (WCDMA) signal as the input. The
bandwidth of integration was 3.84MHz and the center
spacing of the adjacent passband was 5MHz as deﬁned
for the WCDMA system. Figure 7 shows the spectral
regrowth plot for the FP device at 2GHz when biased
at 30V with a corresponding output power at P1 dB. An
ACPR of 33:8 dBc was achieved. Figure 8 shows the
ACPR comparison for the FP and nFP devices as a function
of power back-oﬀ from P1 dB biased at VDS ¼ 30V with a
15mA/mm current density. Again, the load impedances
were set to be the same as those in the case for IMD3
measurement. It was observed that the FP device exhibited a
better ACPR performance at and beyond P1 dB than the nFP
device. This improvement makes the FP device favorable for
operation under higher output power.
4. Conclusions
In this study, a ﬁeld-plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT device has
been fabricated and characterized. Measurement results
revealed an output power of 25.36 dBm with a linear gain
of 15.39 dB achieved for the FP-HEMT at 2GHz when
biased at Vds ¼ 30V. An improvement in breakdown

Modern wireless communication systems have put 
extremely stringent requirements on both power and

overall gate periphery of the device 100μm, consisting of 
two gate fingers with each gate finger width of 50μm.  
The measured output power and gain are plotted as 
functions of input power at 2 GHz in Fig. 2.  The device 
featured a P1dB of 3.1W/mm with 15.5 dB small signal 
gain while biased at Vds = 30V.  For linearity 
characterization, both two-tone and digitally modulated 
W-CDMA signals were used as excitation for IMD3 and 
ACPR measurement respectively.  The load impedance 
was tuned for maximum output power at 2 GHz for both 
measurement.  Fig. 3 shows the measured IMD3 as a 
function of power back-off from P1dB under various 
quiescent current at Vds = 20V.   For ACPR measurement, 
the bandwidth of integration was 3.84 MHz and the center 
spacing of the adjacent passband was 5 MHz as defined 
for W-CDMA system.  Fig. 4 shows the measured ACPR 
in dBc as a function of input power under various

In this study, field-plated AlGaN/GaN HEMT 
device has been fabricated and characterized.  
Measurement results revealed a P1dB of 3.1 W/mm 
achieved at 2 GHz when biased at Vds = 30V.  Linearity
