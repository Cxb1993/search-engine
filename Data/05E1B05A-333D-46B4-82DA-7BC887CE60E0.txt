extra low friction hence they are good candidates for joint or spine soft tissues (like articular 
cartilage) repair. Some hydrogels could be tailored to degrade at certain rate to provide space for the 
growing tissues in the construct hence eliminates the need for a second surgery [1]. Hydrogel 
scaffolds could also be taken as drug carrier to deliver growth factors or other pharmacologics at the 
diseased site to encourage certain cellular responses, such as proliferation or differentiation. All of 
the advantages above indicate the importance of the hydrogel materials in tissue engineering. 
In this research, Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), Split Hopkinson Tension Bar (SHTB), 
as well as Modified Torsional Kolsky Bar (MTKB) were utilized to study the dynamic behavior of 
prepared specimens. By changing the applied strain rate, the volume ratio vs. pressure curves and 
true stress vs. true strain curves were observed to describe the compressibility of hydrogels under 
dynamic deformations. The dynamic shear response of thin SiC layers was also studied. 
 
2. Experiment Procedures  
2.1 Experimental Configuration and Setup 
2.1.1 Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) 
The Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (Fig. 1) is an adaptation of the device developed by Kolsky 
[2]. It consists of a gas gun system, an incident bar, a transmitted bar and a specimen assembly. A 
projectile fired from a gas gun impacts one end of the incident bar and generates a compressive 
stress pulse propagating down the bar into the specimen. This pulse reverberates within the 
specimen, sending a transmitted pulse into the transmitted bar and a reflected pulse back into the 
incident bar. The bars are designed to remain elastic throughout the test so that the complete 
displacement time and stress-time histories at the interfaces between the specimen and the bars can 
be determined from measurements of the incident, reflected and transmitted pulses [3]. Figure 2 
shows the SHPB facility built in KUAS. The length of the SHPB table is about 8 meters and the 
incident and transmitted bars are made by 22mm diameter AL7075.

2.1.2 Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar (SHTB) 
The Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar was first introduced by Harding [4]. Since then, SHTB have 
emerged into five different categories separated from their different pulse generation and sample 
clamping structures. In National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, we use striker bar 
along with dog-bone shaped specimen to study the high strain rate properties of novel materials,

2.1.3 Specimen Assembly in Compression Tests 
In this research, a special specimen assembly was implanted to modify the dynamic strain 
condition in the specimen during the experiments, as shown in Fig. 7. An acrylic tube was used as a 
confinement for the soft hydrogel specimens. The confinement cell prevents radial expansion, 
resulting in the development of a uniaxial strain state rather than a uniaxial stress state. Thus, the 
only deformations are along the axis of the specimen, and measurement of these deformations 
provides a measure of the volume change in the sample [5]. The stress state in the specimen builds 
up to a hydrostatic stress state which approximating the measured axial stress. Each test therefore 
provides one data point: a measured volumetric strain corresponding to a measured pressure. 
 
 
Fig.7 Specimen assembly for hydrostatic experiments. 
 
2.1.4 Specimen Assembly for Tensile Tests 
For SHTB experiments, dog-bone shaped specimen assembly was implanted to study the 
dynamic tensile strain condition, as shown in Fig. 8. A steel fixer was used as a confinement for the 
dog-bone shaped specimens. The fixer holds the specimen at proper location to ensure dynamic 
tensile loading could be performed on the specimens without undesired slippery or torsion 
conditions. Thus, the only deformations are along the axis of the specimen, and measurement of 
these deformations provides a measure of the dynamic tensile strength of specimens. Each test 
therefore could provide a complete true stress vs. true strain curve for specimens under desired 
strain rate conditions. 
 
 
                Fig.8 Specimen assembly for SHTB experiments. 
 
2.1.5 Specimen Assembly for Torsional Tests 
For MTKB experiments, a tube-shaped contact surface was utilized to study the dynamic shear 
response of materials, as shown in Fig. 9. The designed thin contact band between the disk sample 
and tube sample ensured constant slip velocity on the contact surface. When the contact surfaces 
were compressed properly, the measured wave signals could reveal the dynamic shear response 
between the two surfaces. The temperature rise and slip velocities were also determined to study the 
melting effect for certain cases.

4. Results and Discussion 
Several series of experiments using Hopkinson bar technique has been performed. For the 
dynamic test on hydrogel materials, the duration of the shock pulses was about 118µs~200µs for 
each experiment. Light pulse shaping was applied to ensure the proper ramping during the rise-time 
of the incident pulse to produce a state of equilibrium in the hydrogel specimens and also to prevent 
the specimens from damaging before the compression stress reached equilibrium. The strain rate of 
the experiments were between 100~2400 s-1. Figure 12 shows the experiment result of hydrogels 
with cross-linking concentration 6.75%, in which the test result shows that when the strain rate 
increased the elastic modulus of hydrogels increased accordingly.  From the constrained condition 
experiments, the dynamic bulk strength of the tested hydrogel specimens can be observed, as shown 
in Figure 13. It does not exhibit perfect linear behavior when the hydrostatic compression increased. 
However, from this series of experiments we could estimate the bulk modulus of 3.37%, 6.75%, 
and 13.5% hydrogels were 2.04, 1.08, and 3.44 MPa, respectively, when the applied strain rates 
were between 100~300s-1. Higher compression pulse experiments concluded that the dynamic 
strength of the proposed hydrogel material could be as high as 14MPa. 
The dynamic friction experiments of SiC thin films were performed using MTKB facility. 
Figure 14 shows the stable torque loading applied during a series of friction experiments. The 
temperature rise as well as slip velocity measurements was shown in Figure 15. In this figure the 
y-axis indicates the temperature rise and slip velocity at left and right hand sides, respectively. It 
shows that within 30 us, the temperature raised about 60 degrees over room temperature. The slip

8. Self Evaluation 
    In this project, the main objective was to facilitate a versatile MTKB system which is suited 
for both hard and soft material dynamic tests. We have achieved our goal by design and 
manufacture the MTKB in KUAS (Fig. 4). 
  The second objective of the project is to determine the reliability and sensitivity of an 
integrated fiber bragg grating (FBG) system when it was under high strain rate loadings. The FBG 
was embedded inside test samples and a series of experiments confirmed that the accuracy of FBG 
under dynamic loading is similar to, if not better, the Hopkinson bar techniques. Several dynamic 
tests have been performed, and one oral presentation has been presented: 
 
Lee, H; Wang, S. H.; Chiang, C.C. and Tsai, L. (2010), The influences of residual stress in epoxy 
carbon-fiber composites under high strain rates, SEM annual conference, Oslo, Norway. 
 
    By assembling MTKB system, students are able to learn proper design and communication 
skills with the machine shops. Also, the research results should give us a clear idea of the shock 
absorbing and dynamic property of various engineering materials. The objectives of the project 
have been successfully achieved.

Introduction
  Fiber Brag Grating (FBG) was first introduced by Hill* in 1978.  Recent 
studies discovered that when FBG sensors are embedded in CFRP 
laminates, the reflection spectrum from the FBG sensors could be used to 
measure complicated non-axisymmetric thermal residual stresses. 
  FBG was embedded inside CFRP to monitor the curing process and 
residual stress in the composite.  
  The dynamic tensile response of CFRP was studied using Split Hopkinson 
Tensile Bar (SHTB) technique. 
  In situ strain signals from embedded FBG were monitored during the 
entire dynamic tensile test process. 
  The thermal residual stress measured from FBG and the dynamic behavior 
of CFRP will be presented in this presentation.
