Abstract 
Recently, remarkable progress has been made in THz photonics. With the development of 
solid-state femto-second lasers and advanced optoelectronic THz-devices, a new epoch of 
fundamental and applied THz science is opening up. For future applications in THz field, 
quasi-optic components such as filters are indispensable. Metal plates perforated with 
two-dimensional sub-wavelength holes arrays (2D-MHA) exhibit extraordinary transmission at 
selective THz frequencies. The transmittance is several times larger than the porosity of 2D-MHA 
plate. This mechanism of the enhanced transmission characteristic is attributed to the resonant 
coupling between the incident light and Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) which is located at the 
metal-dielectric interfaces. The shift of the transmission peak frequency can be realized by 
altering the adjacent material owing to the change of the resonant frequency of the SPP. More 
recently, we demonstrated a THz tunable filter by controlling the refractive index of nematic 
liquid crystal (NLC) filling the holes and adjacent to the 2D-MHA on one side. Its index of 
refraction is varied by magnetically controlling birefringence of the NLC. With the NLC, the 
peak transmission frequency of the 2D-MHA shifts to the red by 0.112 THz and can be tuned 
from 0.193 THz to 0.188 THz. The peak transmittance is as high as 70 % or an enhancement of 
2.42 times. As a tunable THz filter, the device exhibits a continuous tuning range of 4.7 GHz. 
However, new phenomena appeared when holes of the 2D-MHA are filled with dielectric 
material. The effect of filling dielectric material into the holes cannot simply be explained by 
increased effective hole-diameter of the 2D-MHA. We experimentally and numerically 
investigate the role of material in the holes on transmission characteristics of the 2D-MHA. 
Spectral transmittance of the 2D-MHA is measured by using a photoconductive THz 
time-domain spectrometer. The three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) 
algorithm is used to simulate the theoretical results.

The large birefringence and small extinction coefficient of LC 4’-n-pentyl -4-cyanobiphenyl 
(5CB) has been measured and employed for THz wave optical devices by our group [18-19]. We 
have demonstrated the frequency tuning of enhanced THz radiation transmitted through a 
2D-MHA by controlling the effective refractive index of 5CB filling the holes and adjacent to the 
2D-MHA on one side. We have also used UV-adhesives as filler in the holes of MHA to 
generalize the relation to the thickness-variation of MHA filled with dielectric material. 
 
Experiment: 
The THz tunable filter consists of a 2D-MHA with 5CB layer and a pair of rotary permanent 
magnets as shown in Fig. 1. The 2D-MHA is a 0.5 mm-thick aluminum plate perforated with 
circular holes arrayed in a hexagonal lattice of lattice constant s = 0.99 mm and the diameter of 
each hole, d = 0.56 mm. The 2D-MHA is machined on the one side and sandwiched by a pair of 
Mylar sheets (75 μm in thickness) so that a box-like structure of dimension, 0.15 × 15.0 × 15.0 
mm3, in the center of the 2D-MHA is formed for holding the 5CB (Aldrich, 98% purity). The 
holes of the MHA are also filled with 5CB. Two Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets are used to align the 
LC molecules and provide a rotatable external field for tuning the effective refractive index of 
5CB. θ and φ is defined as the angle between the magnetic field and the polarization direction of 
THz signal (y axis). The rotation axis of θ and φ is Z and X, respectively. The effective refractive 
index of LC changes with the LC molecular orientation [20], which is controlled by θ. The 
magnetic field at the center on the sample is 0.15 T, which is triple larger than the critical field (~ 
0.05 T) required for aligning the LC molecules to the field [20]. The LC cell is not aligned by any 
other means. nd of the LC infiltrated in and on one side of the 2D-MHA is changed from 
extra-ordinary refractive index, ne = 1.75 to ordinary refractive index, no = 1.57.

By rotating the magnet assembly along θ while keeping the sample stationary, we only 
change nd without affecting the polarization direction of the THz wave. The maximum θ is 55º. 
Beyond that, the THz beam would be blocked by the magnet in the current experimental setup. 
As for rotating along X-axis (φ), we affect the polarization direction of the THz wave. We can 
image that a birefringent material with its optical axes rotated in the Y - Z plane. Because of the 
rotation of birefringence, the THz waves which pass through this sample will be separated into 
e-ray and o-ray. In theory, the transmittance can be changed but the peak frequency is constant.

The frequencies of the main transmission peaks of LC-filled 2D-MHA for o-ray (magenta 
trace in Fig. 2 (a)) and e-ray (black trace in Fig. 2 (a)), i.e., 5CB aligned perpendicular and 
parallel to the polarization of the incident THz wave, respectively, are red-shifted further to 
0.193 THz and 0.188 THz. Using the refractive indices of 5CB (no = 1.57 and ne = 1.75), we 
estimate that νc = 0.200 THz, νdiff = 0.222 THz and νspp = 0.191 THz for the perpendicular 
geometry (o-ray). Similarly, νc = 0.179 THz, νdiff = 0.199 THz and νspp = 0.171 THz for the 
parallel geometry (e-ray). Thus the observed peak transmission frequencies are close to that of 
the theoretical estimates. As we change from the perpendicular (o-ray) to the parallel (e-ray) 
geometry, the peak transmission (see Fig. 2 (a)) increases from 0.58 to 0.70. As a THz wave filter, 
the insertion loss of the present device is thus 2.35 to 1.55 dB. Considering the porosity of the 
tunable 2D-MHA, 0.29, we observe an enhancement factor of 2.42. 
The change in peak transmittance of the 2D-MHA by varying the effective refractive index 
of 5CB is shown in Fig. 3. The THz transmission peak increases with θ for θ < 30°. This can be 
explained by how close the refractive index of LC matches that of Mylar. The ordinary and 
extraordinary refractive indices of 5CB are 1.57 and 1.75, respectively, at 0.3 THz. With 
increasing θ, the effective refractive index of LC will descend from 1.75 to 1.70 (from θ = 0° to θ 
= 30°) and the refractive index of Mylar substrate, which is 1.70. Over 30°, nd will decrease from 
1.70 to 1.57 with increasing θ. The transmission peak will then decrease according to the same 
theory.

It is well-known that an in-plane momentum is needed to modify the incident wave to 
achieve the enhanced transmission. Either the SPP model, or the model of evanescent wave 
diffracted by the hole edges can provide such a mechanism [24]. We have calculated distributions 
of Ex of the electric field for 400 μm-thick 2D-MHA filled with UV-adhesive, as shown in Fig. 6. 
The frequencies of the incident THz wave are 0.191 THz in Fig. 6. (a) and 0.276 THz in Fig. 6. 
(b), respectively. At 0.191 THz, the charge distribution on the side wall of each individual hole 
shows an anti-symmetric pattern between the top and bottom portion of the hole. At 0.276 THz, 
the charge distribution is symmetric, and surface waves on the top and bottom are coupled 
together. Details of peak frequencies and reasons of the peak drift are still not clear, but it is clear 
that SPP play an important role in enhanced transmission characteristics.

Summary: 
We have demonstrated a room temperature THz tunable filter by using magnetically 
controlled birefringence, 5CB in 2D-HMA. The frequency tuning of enhanced THz radiation 
transmitted has been achieved successfully through 2D-MHA by controlling the refractive index 
of 5CB filling the holes and adjacent to the 2D-MHA on one side. As for THz tunable filter, the 
central pass-band tuning frequency range is from 0.193 to 0.188 THz and this device exhibits a 
continuous tuning range of 4.5 GHz, relatively low insertion losses of 2.35 to 1.55 dB. The 
maximum transmission of the device is well above (2.42 times) that according to the porosity of 
the holes and varies from 55% to above 70%. The tuning range can be as high as 0.037 THz by 
employing matching LC substrates on both sides of the 2D-MHA and highly anisotropic LC 
materials.  
On other hand, we find distinctive THz transmission characteristics depending on the 
thickness for the 2D-MHA of which holes are filled with UV-adhesive. For deeper holes, SPP can 
exhibit two distinct modes, coupled and uncoupled types as confirmed in the simulated results for 
the electric field by FDTD method. 
About the work of the “Control of enhanced THz transmission through MHAs using NLC”, 
the paper is already published in Opt. Express (13, 3921, 2005). As for the work of the “Effects of 
Hole Material on Enhanced Terahertz Transmission through MHAs”, the paper is published in 
The 18th Annual Meeting of the IEEE Lasers (983, 2005). The achieved percentage of scheduled 
progress of whole project is almost finished. And more results are under investigation.
