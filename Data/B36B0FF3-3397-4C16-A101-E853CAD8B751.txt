三、天線設計 
The proposed sleeve monopole antenna consists of a monopole and two sleeves, and it is 
fabricated on a FR4 substrate of thickness 1.6 mm and dielectric constant 4.4. Two types of the 
antenna are investigated and shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b). In Fig. 1(a), the sleeves are printed in 
back side of the substrate and are the extension of the ground plane. In Fig. 1(b), the sleeves are 
printed in front side of the substrate and shorted to the ground plane by using shorting pins. A 
50-Ω  microstrip line of width 3 mm is used for feeding the proposed antenna. The ground plane 
size is G × 48 mm2. The monopole having a length of H and a width of 2 mm is centrally 
connected to the end of the microstrip line. Two equal sleeves of L × 2 mm2 are symmetrically 
placed on each side of the monopole. The spacing between the monopole and the sleeve is 
denoted as S. 
For the proposed antenna, the wideband characteristic can be achieved by the excitation of 
the first two resonant modes. The first resonant frequency is basically determined by the total 
length (H + G) of the antenna. For designing at the lower-edge frequency (470 MHz) of the 
operating band in DTV application, the monopole length H was selected to be 180 mm. As for the 
second resonant frequency, it is mainly controlled by the sleeve length L and spacing S. In the 
study, the spacing S was optimized to be 3 mm for achieving broadband operation, and the 
dependence of the impedance bandwidth on the sleeve length L and the ground-plane length G is 
investigated. 
 
四、結果與討論 
A. Sleeves in back side 
The design with sleeves in back side, shown in Fig. 1(a), has been implemented. To 
accurately predict the impedance characteristics of the antenna, Ansoft HFSS simulation software 
has been applied to guide this design. Figure 2 shows the measured and simulated return loss of 
the proposed antenna with an optimal length of the sleeve (L = 72 mm). Good agreement between 
the measurement and the simulation is observed. To demonstrate the effect of the sleeve length L 
on improving the impedance bandwidth of the proposed design, Figures 3 shows the measured 
input impedance and the corresponding return loss for antennas with various values of L, where 
the ground-plane length was fixed at G = 60 mm. The corresponding impedance bandwidths are 
tabulated in Table 1. The result for a conventional monopole antenna without sleeves (i.e. L = 0) 
is also shown in the figures for comparison. It is first seen that for the conventional monopole 
antenna, a single resonant mode is excited at about 450 MHz, but the matching condition of this 
resonant mode is worse due to an insufficient ground-plane dimension. While for the proposed 
antenna with two sleeves added, two resonant modes are excited. By increasing the length L, the 
first resonant frequency is almost unchanged, but the second resonant frequency is decreased and 
shifted to the first resonant frequency. And from the results, it is found that when L is selected in 
the range from 70 to 80 mm, the two resonant modes are excited at close frequencies and with 
good impedance matching, which results in a wide bandwidth. The maximum bandwidth 
determined from 10-dB return loss is occurred at L = 72 mm (about 0.4 H) and is as large as 
about 47.7% (445−724 MHz) with center frequency at 585 MHz. 
 
Table 1: Performance of the proposed antenna with sleeves in back side for various sleeve lengths; 
H = 180 mm, S = 3 mm, G = 60 mm. The Bandwidth is determined from 10-dB return loss and 
referenced to the center frequency fC [= (fL + fH) / 2], where fL and fH are, respectively, the lower 
and upper edge frequencies with 10-dB return loss.

五、結論 
Two promising designs of microstrip-line-fed sleeve monopole antennas with sleeves in 
front or back side of the substrate have been constructed and experimentally studied. Almost the 
same results have been obtained for the two designs, and the obtained impedance bandwidths of 
about 47% has been demonstrated by selecting suitable sleeve length and spacing. A very small 
variation in the impedance bandwidth is observed when the ground-plane length varies with a 
great range. The proposed antenna is very suitable for application in a device with a limited 
ground-plane dimension.

六、其他
2mm to 6 mm, three adjacent resonant modes are excited with good impedance matching,
which leads to a greatly enhanced impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna. For the
optimum spacing of S = 2.7 mm, the upper-edge frequency is increased to 4.88 GHz. This
yields an impedance bandwidth ratio of 2.0:1.
Moreover, it is found that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed design can be further
improved by selecting the proper dimensions of the 50- CPW feed line. Fig. 4 presents the
measured return loss for three cases of a 50- CPW feed line with different signal-strip
width (Wf) and gap width (G), where the sleeve length and the spacing are fixed to be = 7
mm and S = 2.7 mm, respectively. It is clearly seen in Fig. 4 that antenna 3 using a 50-
CPW feed line with G = 0.5 mm and Wf = 6.4 mm greatly improves the matching condition
with significant increase of the upper-edge frequency, and its upper-edge frequency is greatly
increased to 8.16 GHz. The obtained impedance bandwidth ratio reaches about 3.4:1, which is
suitable for operation in UWB communication. From the obtained results, it can be concluded
that using the feeding scheme of a CPW line is an effective way to further improve the
broadband impedance characteristics of the sleeve monopole antenna.
The radiation characteristics of antenna 3 have also been studied. Fig. 5 plots the typical
radiation patterns at 2.45, 5.25 and 8.15 GHz. For 2.45 GHz, the measured radiation pattern in
the H plane (x-y plane) is close to omnidirectional radiation, and the measured antenna gain is
about 2.1 dBi. For 5.25 GHz near the center frequency of the impedance bandwidth, the
radiation patterns suffer some distortion, and the antenna gain is about 1.1 dBi. As for 8.15
GHz, a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern in the H plane is also observed, and the
antenna gain is higher and is about 4.2 dBi.
Conclusions
This paper has presented a novel planar UWB sleeve monopole antenna, which is fed by a
CPW line. Experimental results show that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna
can significantly be improved by selecting suitable sleeve length and spacing. In addition, the
obtained results have demonstrated that using CPW feeding configuration is an effective way
to enhance the broadband impedance characteristics of the sleeve monopole antenna.
