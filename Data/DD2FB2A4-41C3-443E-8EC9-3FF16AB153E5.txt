The abstract for optical characterization of In2O3 nanorods: 
 
Direct-optical evidence of Burstein-Moss shift (BMS) in conduction band of cubic c-In2O3 
nanowires is reported. The optical property of degenerate semiconducting oxide c-In2O3 has been 
investigated by thermoreflectance (TR) spectroscopy. Low-temperature TR spectra clearly show a 
series of band-edge excitons for c-In2O3. The threshold energy for the exciton series was 
determined. One transition feature of direct gap caused by BMS was detected in all the TR 
spectra from 20 to 300 K. The Femi-level (EF) energy above conduction-band edge (EC) is 
determined to be EF-EC≈92 meV. The energy value causes a calculated electron density of about 
2.1×1019 cm-3. The direct gap of c-In2O3 with BMS is 3.43 eV at 300 K. Free exciton, bound 
exciton complexes, donor-acceptor pair transition, and defect emissions have been evaluated by 
 5
BMS (i.e. EF-EC) is difficult to measure directly by only transmittance or absorption 
measurements.  
Experimental studies on excitons and electronic structure of nanocrystals are crucial and 
essential in chemical-physics field for semiconductor nanostructures. Comprehensible evaluation 
of the origin for band-edge excitons and BMS in In2O3 nanocrystals is very important. In this report, 
we demonstrate thermoreflectance (TR) as an important tool to probe band-edge excitons and 
electronic structure of In2O3 nanocrystals. TR is a powerful technique for probing direct transition 
in semiconductors and oxide nanostructures. The derivative-like TR spectra suppress uninteresting 
background effects and emphasizes the transition features localized in the energy region near direct 
critical-points transitions. The transition energy can be determined accurately via spectral analysis 
of the derivative line shape of the TR feature. The c-In2O3 nanowires were grown on Si (100) 
substrate using vapor transport driven by vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Low-temperature 
TR spectrum revealed an excitonic series containing E1=3.398 eV (n=1) and E2=3.428 eV (n=2) at 
20 K. The direct gap (threshold energy) for the exciton series was hence determined to be 3.438 eV 
at 20 K. One additional transition feature EV-CF=3.53 eV, which originates from the direct gap 
caused by BMS, has also been detected in the TR spectrum at 20 K. The energy of BMS is 
evaluated to be EF-EC ≈ 92 meV. The Burstein-Moss shift results in an electron density (calculated) 
close to 2.1×1019 cm-3. Free exciton, bound exciton complexes (BECs), donor-acceptor pair (DAP) 
transition, and defect emissions have also been evaluated by temperature-dependent 
photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the c-In2O3 nanorods. PL measurements of different 
laser powers were carried out to probe and identify the origins of below-band-edge transitions in 
the In2O3 nanowires. Based on the experimental analysis, the below- and above-band-edge 
structures of c-In2O3 thin-film nanowires are realized. 
 
三、實驗 
 
Nanowire Growth. The In2O3 nanowires were grown using vapor transport driven by VLS 
mechanism. A horizontal tube furnace was utilized for the growth. Molten indium (0.5 g, 
99.9999%) was the source material and put into a boat placed at the center of the quartz tube. A 
thin layer of gold (5 nm) was pre-deposited on silicon (001) substrates by sputtering. The 
substrates were placed in another boat and positioned downstream. The quartz tube was 
evacuated and the furnace was heated to 900°C with a rate of 10°C/min. Highly pure oxygen 
carried by argon gas was fed into the quartz tube. The growth temperature was 650°C with a 
background pressure of 0.5 Torr. Typical growth time was 2 hrs. After the growth, samples were 
then cooled down under the same ambient gas. The chemical reaction for the growth process was 
4In(g) + 3O2(g) → 2In2O3(s).

these nanostructures are also demonstrated in Figure 1(c) for comparison. In general, for c-In2O3 
with a bcc structure, the relationship between the surface formation energies should be 
corresponding to γ{111}<γ{100}<γ{110}. Therefore, the highest growth rate must occur in the crystal 
direction of <110> and the second is <100>, and finally the slowest is <111>. This result is why 
each nanowire tip usually presents four apparent {111} faces and the c-In2O3 easily forms a 
stacking formula of nanotower with each tower edge along the highest growth rate of {110} plane.

transition energies of the exciton sequence (E1 and E2) can be further analyzed by using Rydberg

Figure 2. Experimental TR and PL spectra of c-In2O3 thin-film nanorods at 20 
K. The three PL spectra were excited by different laser powers of 325 nm-Lo 
(33 mW⋅cm-2), 266 nm-Lo (2.4 W⋅cm-2), and 266 nm-Hi (24 W⋅cm-2). The inset 
depicts the low-temperature PL spectrum at 10 K for showing clearly the 
emission features below band edge.  
 
where Ryd is effective Rydberg constant, n is principal quantum number, and En=∞ is threshold 
energy for the exciton series. From the analysis, the exciton binding energy for n=1 ground-state 
level (i.e. Ryd) is about 40 meV. The threshold energy (i.e. direct gap) for the c-In2O3 nanorods is 
d
gE =3.438 eV at 20 K. The transition features of EA-CF and EV-CF in Figure 2 are, respectively, 
assigned to be the transitions of acceptor to EC and EV to EC by taking into account the BMS 
effect. The origins of EA-CF and EV-CF will be identified and discussed later via the analyses of 
polarized TR (PTR), temperature-dependent PL, and temperature-dependent resistivity 
measurements.  
As shown in Figure 2, for characterization of the below-band-edge transitions in c-In2O3 
nanowires, three high-resolution PL spectra obtained by different excitation sources of 325nm/33

Figure 3. Temperature-dependent PL spectra of c-In2O3 nanorods between 10 
and 300 K excited by 266 nm-Lo. The inset shows the temperature-dependent 
PL spectra of 10-300 K excited by 325 nm-Lo.  
 
To verify the origins of below-band-edge transitions in c-In2O3 thin-film nanorods, 
temperature-dependent PL measurements were carried out. Figure 3 shows the PL spectra of 
c-In2O3 nanorods from 10 to 300 K obtained by 266 nm-Lo excitation condition. Many of the 
below band-edge emission features including FX, A, B, C, DAP, A-LO, and B-LO can be 
detected in the low-temperature PL spectra. The FX feature near 3.378 eV at 10 K is inferred to 
be a free-exciton luminescence. This assignment can be verified from the temperature 
dependence of peak intensity of FX decreases more slowly than the other features A, B, and C 
when the temperature increases. The inset in Figure 3 shows more clearly that the BECs followed 
by FX and the FX peak will eventually dominate the emission feature at higher temperatures 
from 10 to 300 K under the excitation condition of 325 nm-Lo. As shown in Figure 3, the 
emission peaks of A≈3.368 eV, B≈3.360 eV, and C≈3.353 eV at low temperature are inferred to 
be the BECs, each peak bounded to a neutral donor level by oxygen vacancy (VO) to form a D0X 
feature similar to that in CdS nanobelts.25 The oxygen vacancies in c-In2O3 are a series of shallow 
donor levels (defects) near the surface of nanorod to contribute conductivity. The appearance of 
multiple bound-exciton peaks A, B, and C in Figure 3 implies that oxygen vacancies in c-In2O3 
nanorods may probably be a series of shallow donor levels similar to a defect donor band existed 
in Ga2O3 nanostructures constructed by VO. Observing in Figure 3, when the temperature 
increases, the shallow donor levels ionized rapidly to decrease and broaden the PL features of the 
BECs. The A, B, and C peaks are free from the defect donors’ bounding as well as they will 
finally merge with the FX peak at even higher temperatures. The DAP feature is a 
donor-acceptor-pair emission which presents a red-shift behavior similar to the BECs features. 
The acceptors in DAP might be indium-oxygen vacancy pairs VO-VIn and the donors are the 
oxygen vacancies VO. For the VLS growth, when formation of indium oxide nanocrystallite, the 
InO1-x molecules are easy to volatilize at high temperature. The consequence is easy to form 
oxygen vacancies, indium vacancies, and oxygen-indium vacancy pairs in the In2O3 
nanostructures. As shown in Figure 3, the relative intensity of the DAP decreased slowly before 
100 K and reduced quickly when the temperature increased up to 260 K. With T > 260 K, the 
DAP shows approximately weaker and broadened to merge with the free exciton peak FX. When 
photons emitted out from the c-In2O3 nanorods, the FX peak closely relates to the band-edge 
emission and DAP correlates with the recombination of donors and acceptors. The binding energy 
of ED+EA can be estimated approximately from the low-temperature PL spectrum at 10 K by 
FX-DAP≈0.068 eV (see Figure 3). If the columbic energy is neglected and the binding energy of 
ED is estimated to be about 6 meV (i.e. ionization temperature of A peak is around 60-77K), the

Figure 5. (a) Temperature-dependent PL spectra of c-In2O3 nanorods between 
10 and 300 K excited by 266 nm-Hi. (b) The PL spectra of 10 K and 300 K 
together with  the defect emission mechanisms for shallow donor (VO) and 
deeper acceptor (VIn) at room temperature (RT) and low temperature (LT) are 
depicted in the inset for comparison.  
 
red-shift behavior with the increase of temperatures from 10 to 300 K while the defect emission 
peak seems to be blue shift due to many of the defect luminescences consisted in one defect 
emission feature. This situation can be evident in Figure 5 (b). The defect emissions below band 
edge of c-In2O3 nanorods may come from the recombinations of donors and acceptors. The 
donors may be a series of shallow VO levels and the acceptors include shallow VO-VIn pairs and 
deeper indium vacancies VIn. As shown in the room-temperature PL spectrum in Figure 5 (b), at 
 15
40 meV (Ryd) and a direct gap of 3.438 eV ( dgE ) at 20 K (see Figure 2). The binding energy of n= 
2 level (E2) was estimated to be about 10 meV using Equation (2). The value is in good 
accordance with the ionization temperature of E2 with T >100 K as shown in 
temperature-dependent TR spectra in Figure 6. The energy of the EA-CF transition is 3.468 eV at 
20 K, which lies in between dgE  and EV-CF (3.53 eV). The inset in Figure 6 depicts a band 
diagram for the indication of band-edge transitions in c-In2O3 nanorods. There are two electronic 
effects of BMS and shallow VO-VIn pairs contributed to the occurrence of the EA-CF transition. 
The EA-CF transition is inferred not coming from the crystal-field-splitting band (∆) in the EV of 
c-In2O3. This inference is evident in the upper part of Figure 7, where polarized TR (PTR) spectra 
of the c-In2O3 thin-film nanorods with different polarization angles of 0° [i.e. E || <010> as the 
direction indicated in Figure 1(a)], 45°, and 90° [i.e. E ⊥ <010>] are present. The relative 
intensities of E1 and EA-CF transitions measured by PTR are nearly invariant. It verifies that the 
EA-CF transition is not originated from the valence-band splitting followed by selection rule. The 
EA-CF is closely related to the transition from shallow acceptor level of VO-VIn pair to the EF 
above EC. The temperature-variation behavior of the EA-CF feature in Figure 6 shows the 
amplitude of EA-CF becomes smaller and broadened with temperatures up to 260 K similar to the 
temperature dependence of DAP presented in Figure 3. This phenomenon sustains the assignment 
of transition origin of EA-CF. Furthermore, the energy difference between EV-CF and EA-CF is 62 
meV at 20 K, which also matches well with the acceptor binding energy EA (in DAP) obtained by 
PL in Figure 3. This result verifies the EA-CF comes from the transition of VO-VIn pairs to the EF 
above EC.  
In order to verify the BMS effect in the c-In2O3 thin-film nanorods, temperature-dependent 
resistivity measurement from 77 to 320 K was carried out. Displayed in the lower part of Figure 7 is 
temperature dependence of resistivities of c-In2O3 thin-film nanorods. For a degenerate 
semiconductor with BMS, the dependence of resistivity may present a metallic behavior owing to 
the EC bottom always fills with electrons. The temperature dependence of resistivities of c-In2O3 
shows that resistivity increases with the increase of temperatures. The experimental evidence 
reveals that c-In2O3 is a degenerate semiconductor with its Fermi level higher above 
conduction-band edge (i.e. EF>EC). The energy difference between EV-CF and dgE  determines the 
value of BMS (i.e. EF-EC=EV-CF- dgE ). The value is about 92 meV at 20 K. As the temperature 
increases, the E1 and EV-CF transitions show nearly parallel temperature dependence from 20 to 300 
K (see Figure 6). It means that EF-EC is also near 92 meV at 300 K. The relationship between 
carrier concentration (ne) and Burstein-Moss shift (∆E) is:

EiB(T)=EiB(0)-εiB/[exp( iBωh /kT)-1], where i is the respective transition feature, εiB represents the 
strength of electron-phonon interaction and iBωh  corresponds to average phonon energy. The 
fitted results are listed in TABLE 1 for comparison. The obtained values of εB (strength of 
electron-phonon interaction) are similar (i.e. 115-120 meV) for the transitions of EV-CF, E2, E1, 
and FX due to they are band-to-band transitions across band gap to present nearly parallel 
temperature dependence of energy shift (see Figure 8). The defect related transitions EA-CF, BX 
(BECs), and DAP reveal smaller values of εB (i.e. 68-70 meV) in comparison with those of the 
band-to-band transitions. The temperature-insensitive energy shift is a general character for a 
defect transition with dangling bond or interstitial. The value of average phonon energy Bωh  
for all the transition features in c-In2O3 is 20-22 meV, which agrees well with the energy 
difference between E1 and FX induced by phonons (see Figure 2).

an excellent candidate not only for TCO electronics but also being a window layer on 
solar-energy material to facilitate photoelectric conversion of the solar-cell structure. 
In summary, a comprehensive study for whole below- and above-band-edge transitions in 
c-In2O3 thin-film nanowires has been explored. Direct-optical observation of band-edge excitons 
and Burstein-Moss shift by thermoreflectance spectroscopy has been successfully carried out. 
The energy of band-edge exciton E1 is 3.298 eV at room temperature and the direct gap is 3.43 
eV with a Burstein-Moss shift of about 92 meV to render an electron density approaching 
2.1×1019 cm-3. Excitonic binding energies of 40 meV for E1 and 10 meV for E2 for an exciton 
series can be observed by temperature-dependent TR measurements of c-In2O3. The threshold 
energy for the Rydberg series is 3.338 eV at 300 K. Power-dependent and temperature-dependent 
PL measurements verify and identify the properties of below-band-edge transitions including free 
exciton, bound exciton complexes, donor-acceptor pairs, LO phonon replicas, and defect 
emissions. Photo V-I measurements show well-behaved photoelelctric conversion for the c-In2O3 
thin-film photoconductor. Based on the experimental analyses, physical-chemistry behaviors of 
the indium oxide nanowires are realized and their potential applications are manifested.

Abstract. We have demonstrated structural and electronic properties of a series solar energy crystals 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 by using measurement techniques of X-ray diffraction, polarized thermo-reflectance 
(PTR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Single crystals of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) with 
x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.0 were grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) method using ICl3 
as a transport agent. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the as-grown crystals crystallize in 
chalcopyrite phase with the relations of lattice constants of a(x)=(5.526±0.002)-(0.188±0.003)⋅x Å 
and c(x)=(11.122±0.003)-(0.680±0.004)⋅x Å, respectively. Electronic structure of valence band of 
the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series were probed experimentally by XPS. The characteristic peaks of 
the XPS spectra also verified stoichiometric compositions of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 with different Al 
content. Crystal-field splitting (∆) in the valence band of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 was characterized using PTR 
with E || <11 1 > and E ⊥ <11 1 > polarizations. The PTR spectra clearly showed that the energy value 
of ∆ increases with the increase of Al content x in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 series due to the enhanced strain 
in the lattice. The composition-dependent crystal-field-splitting energies can be evaluated and 
determined to be ∆(x)= (10±2)+( 139±5)⋅x meV. Based on the experimental analyses, the crystal 
structure and valence-band structure of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series are thus realized. 
Introduction 
The I-III-VI2 (I=Cu, Ag, III=In, Ga, Al, and VI=S, Se) family crystals are recently the subject of 
potential interest for application in photovoltaic solar cells due to their high absorption coefficient 
[1-3]. To further improve photoelectric conversion efficiency in the I-III-VI2-based solar cell, a 
superior way is construction of a tandem (cascaded) solar cell by growing a series of I-III-VI2 family 
thin films with progressive band gaps to absorb step by step a wide-energy-range radiation. 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) belong to the I-III-VI2 family crystals formed by inter-substitution of the 
group III elements (Al and In) in the sulfide compounds. The chalcopyrite series covers the widest 
spectral range of energy gap ranging from ~1.5 eV (CuInS2) to ~3.5 eV (CuAlS2) which possesses the 
peak-absorption responses from near infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) region [4, 5]. For a cascaded 
thin-film solar cell fabricated by Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1), CuInS2 may cover the NIR region [4], 
CuAlS2 should dominate the UV portion [5], and the intermediate compositions of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 
(0<x<1) may play an important role for optoelectronic conversion in the visible range. Moreover, a 
solar cell made from Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 is more environmentally friendly since it is free of Se [6]. It 
possesses both efficiency and green function to its future availability. Before technical applications of 
the chalcopyrites, a better understanding on the fundamental physical-chemical properties of the 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series is needed. Therefore, high-quality copper aluminum indium disulphide 
crystals are necessary to be grown for crucial evaluations. 
 were carried out with the linearly polarized lights setting at E || <11 1 > (θ = 0°) and E ⊥ <11 1 > (θ = 
90°) polarizations for the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series. 
Results and Discussion 
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) chalcopyrites with x=0, 
0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 1.0 in the angular range of 20°-72° are displayed in Fig. 1. Several peak 
features that respectively indexed to the tetragonal chalcopyrite phase of the as-grown crystals for 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, a lot of diffraction peaks such as

(112), (200), (211), and (400), etc. shift slowly to the higher diffraction angle with increasing the 
aluminum content x from x=0 (CuInS2) to x=1 (CuAlS2) in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 chalcopyrite series. 
This result also indicates that the as-grown chalcopyrite series crystals are single phase and 
isostructural with higher lattice constant in CuInS2 and lower lattice constant in CuAlS2. The lattice 
constants a and c for the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 chalcopyrites can be analyzed by a tetragonal equation from 
diffraction peaks and their compositional dependences can be fitted with a linear equation. The fitting 
results of the linear relationship are determined to be a(x)=5.526±0.002-(0.188±0.003)⋅x Å and 
c(x)=11.122±0.003-(0.680±0.004)⋅x Å, respectively. The values of c/a for the chalcopyrites are 
2.013 for CuInS2, 2.001 for Cu(Al0.2In0.8)S2, 1.991 for Cu(Al0.4In0.6)S2, 1.985 for Cu(Al0.5In0.5)S2, 
1.980 for Cu(Al0.6In0.4)S2, 1.975 for Cu(Al0.7In0.3)S2, and 1.956 for CuAlS2, respectively. The value 
of c/a decreases with the increase of Al concentration due to the shrinkage of average III-S bond 
length in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) chalcopyrite series. Generally, the chalcopyrite unit cell 
approximately doubles the size of a zinc-blende unit cell along c-axis (i.e. c≈2a). The c/a value is an 
index of structural distortion of the chalcopyrites. 
Displayed in Fig. 2 are the experimental TR spectra of Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 with x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 
0.7, and 1.0 at 300 K in the energy range of 1.25 – 6 eV. The dashed lines are the experimental data 
and solid curves are least-squares fits to a functional form appropriate for the interband transitions

to –2.2 eV (CuAlS2) in EV for the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 series. This peak feature is correlated with the Cu 3d 
electrons in the valence band. The contribution of this peak feature can be evident from the group 
transitions of ED, EE, and EF features shown in TR measurements of Fig. 2 by Cu 3d→S 3p*

Fig. 4. (a) Experimental PTR spectra of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series along E || <11 1 > and E 
⊥ <11 1 > polarizations near band edge. (b) Composition dependence of crystal-field splitting 
energy (∆) in the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) chalcopyrite series at 300 K. The solid line is fitted to a 
linear relationship ∆(x)=∆(0)+m⋅x.   
In order to detailed characterize the crystal-field splitting effect in the valence band, PTR 
measurements of the Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series were carried out.  Fig. 4(a) shows the PTR spectra 
of E || <11 1 > (θ = 0° along needle axis) and E ⊥ <11 1 > (θ = 90°) for some selective samples of 
Cu(AlxIn1-x)S2 (0≤x≤1) series at 300 K. The obtained transition energies are denoted as E|| (EA) and 
E⊥ (EB) indicated by arrows in Fig. 4. The energies of the band-edge transitions E|| and E⊥ show an 
energy blue-shift behavior with the increase of Al composition from x=0 (CuInS2) to x=1 (CuAlS2) 
such as the general semiconducting behavior of the mixed compounds. The variation of band gaps in
