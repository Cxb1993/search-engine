non-convex [13]. Critical difficulties, therefore, 
arise because conventional local optimization 
algorithms cannot efficiently solve this problem, 
particularly when the controller structure is fixed 
[8]. Evolutionary algorithms, with their capabilities 
of directed random search for global optimization 
[17-23], have provided a promising alternative to 
address the above-mentioned problems and 
difficulties. This motivates the use of genetic 
algorithms in the design of tolerance controllers for 
interval systems. Based on extremal design 
philosophy, the design problem is first formulated 
as constrained optimization problems based on 
deviation between the desired and extremal 
GM/PM of the resulting loop transfer function, and 
subsequently optimized via the proposed 
multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). To 
ensure robust stability of the closed-loop system, 
root locations associated with the generalized 
Kharitonov segment polynomials [24] will be used 
to establish a constraints handling mechanism for 
effective evaluation of chromosomes in the current 
population. Because of the cost functions which 
adopt the concept of centrality, evolution is directed 
toward derivation of Pareto optimal solutions of the 
tolerance controllers with better centrality and 
limited spreading along the desired region of 
acceptability, resulting in more consistent system 
performances and improved robustness of the 
closed-loop system. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
states the design problem. Calculation of extremal 
gain/phase margins of interval systems is given in 
Sec. 3. Design of tolerance controllers based on 
MOGA is given in Section 4. Illustrated examples 
are presented in Section 5. Conclusions are drawn 
in Section 6.

Now the design problem of a tolerance 
controller for an interval plant can be formulated as: 
Give interval plant ),,( basGP  and a set of design 
specifications in terms of acceptability ranges of 
gain margin (GM) and phase margin (PM), defined 
as: 
],[ upperlower GMGM=Ω  and ],[ upperlower PMPM=Φ  
, respectively. Determine a controller ),,( qpsC  
such that closed-loop stability and desired dynamic 
performance are guaranteed. 
 
2.1 Stability validation of the uncertain system 
Note that the characteristic polynomial 
),,,,( baqpsD  of the closed-loop system in Eq. (5) 
has an affine linear uncertainty structure. To 
evaluate the stability of Eq.(5), both generalized 
Kharitonov theorem [24] and Kharitonov theorem 
[28] can be adopted. 
 
2.1.1 Stability test based on generalized 
Kharitonov theorem (GKT) 
Assume that the interval plant ( )sGP  has 
Kharitonov polynomials )(1 sN , )(2 sN , )(3 sN , 
)(4 sN  and )(1 sD , )(2 sD , )(3 sD , )(4 sD  for the 
numerator )(ˆ sN and denominator )(ˆ sD , 
respectively. Robust stability of the family of the 
closed-loop polynomials  
)(ˆ)()(ˆ)(),,,,( sNsqsDspsD +=baqp   (6) 
is guaranteed if and only if all edge polynomials of 
the form: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ){ }

are stable, where { }4,3,2,1∈i , ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ){ }4,3,3,2,3,1,2,1, ∈kj , and 
]1,0[∈λ . 
Obviously, Eq.(7) is consisted of 32 segments 
polynomials, which are generally referred to as 
generalized Kharitonov segment polynomials.  It 
follows that the entire family of the closed-loop 
polynomials ),,,,( baqpsD  is Hurwitz stable if 
and only if the 32 generalized Kharitonov segment 
polynomials ),( λsE∆  are all Hurwitz stable. 
 
2.1.2 Stability test based on Kharitonov theorem  
To alleviate the design effort when validating 
stability of the system, an interval polynomial 
 4
   (20) 
on the real axis for every extremal system ( )sGEi  
can be identified, respectively. Take  { }iρα max=  and { }iσβ min=    
   (21) 
for all extremal system ( )sGEi , .32,,3,2,1 L=i  
Therefore, the smallest gain margin smallestGM  and 
largest gain margin estlGM arg  associated with the 
controller C(s) can be obtained as: 
α
1log20=smallestGM ,   (22) 
and  
β
1log20arg =estlGM ,   (23) 
, respectively. 
 
 
Step 3 (Extremal PM) 
To obtain the smallest and largest phase margin of 
the loop transfer function )(sG , we need to locate 
the intersections on the unit circle of the frequency 
response for each extremal system ( )sGEi . Let 
( ) ( ) 01,, =−= λωλω Eii Gh , .323,2,1 L=i  (24) 
Solving Eq.(24) and substituting the solution 
obtained into ( )λω,EiG∠ , we have the 
intersections jp , L,3,2,1=j , on the unit circle 
for each extremal system ( )sGEi . Thus, the 
smallest angle between °−180  and intersections 
jp  
( ){ } L,3,2,1,,min 0),( =∠== = jGppq ihEijji λωλω (25) 
and the largest angle between °−180  and 
intersections jp  
( ){ } L,3,2,1,,max 0),( =∠== = jGpps ihEijji λωλω (26) 
for each extremal system ( )sGEi  can be identified, 
respectively. Take { }iqmin=γ  and { }ismax=τ   (27) 
for all extremal system ( )sGEi , .32,,3,2,1 L=i  
Therefore, the smallest phase margin smallestPM  
and largest phase margin estlPM arg  associated with 
the controller C(s) can be obtained as:  
o180+= γsmallestPM ,   (28) 
and  
o180arg +=τestlPM    (29) 
, respectively.  
 
 
4. Design of Tolerance Controllers via 
Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) 
Figure 2 shows a framework to derive tolerance 
controllers for an interval plant, in which extremal 
GM/PM associated with the loop transfer function 
is first determined, so that GA proceeds to search 
controller parameters satisfying the specifications 
in terms of acceptability ranges of GM/PM. That is, 
design effort will be made to ensure that smallestGM  
and estlGM arg  associated with the loop transfer 
function lie within the desired range 
],[ upperlower GMGM=Ω , and smallestPM  and 
estlPM arg  associated with the loop transfer 
function lie within the desired range 
],[ upperlower PMPM=Φ , respectively. A set of cost 
functions will be established for optimization to 
derive the tolerance controllers on top of robust 
stability. 
 
4.1 Design Problem to derive tolerance 
controllers based on multi-objective 
optimization (MOP) 
Assume that performance specifications in terms of 
acceptability ranges of GM/PM are specified by the 
user. We formulate the design problem of tolerance 
controllers in the context of MOP, where cost 
functions are established in such a way that 
preference is given to chromosomes resulting in 
extremal phase/gain margins with a relatively 
narrower width of spreading, and whose nominal 
value is centered in the design constraints intervals. 
Chromosomes resulting in extremal GM/PM lying 
outside the desired ROA receive a heavier cost 
relative to the distance deviated from the desired 
boundaries. By doing so, evolution is directed 
toward derivation of Pareto optimal solutions with 
better centrality [13,14] and limited spreading 
along the desired ROA, resulting in more consistent 
time responses and improved robustness. Based on 
the design rationales, cost functions for the design 
problem can be established as follows:

5. Illustrated Examples 
Example 1 
Consider the feedback control system shown in Fig. 
1, where the plant is described by the interval 
transfer function [12] 
( ) [ ][ ] [ ] [ ]ssssG 305.128.11.0072.0005.00032.0
1815
23 ++=  
A controller having the form of

+=  
will be designed, so that a set of design 
specifications in terms of acceptability ranges of 
phase margin ]80,60[ oo=Φ  are satisfied, under 
the plant parameter perturbations. 
[Solution]: 
The uncompensated interval system has extremal 
phase margins of: 
°= 61.1smallestPM  and °= 55.42argestlPM  
, respectively, as shown in the Bode envelope in Fig. 
3, which apparently do not satisfy the specifications. 
Also, wide spreading of the phase margins may 
result in diverse dynamic performances, which is 
undesired. Furthermore, the smallest phase margin 
of °61.1  implies poor relative stability, which 
inevitably provokes undesired transient responses 
of higher overshoot.  
By using the proposed MOGA-based 
approach adopting GA parameters of population 
size=100, pc=0.9, pm=0.15, tournament size k=4, 
and distribution indices for crossover and mutation 
operators 2=cη , 2=mη , and search space of the 
controller parameters of 500 << PK  and 
500 << iK , a non-dominated set of tolerance 
controllers are evolutionarily obtained via the 
proposed MOGA. Figure 4 shows the distribution 
of the non-dominated solutions after 100 
generations of evolution, in which tolerance 
controllers satisfying the desired ROA are marked 
as blue ‘• ’. The user must decide, among these 
Pareto-optimal solutions, which one is most 
suitable for effective implementation via the 
post-optimal techniques by giving relative 
preference to the solutions. For example, if the 
compromise programming approach is adopted to 
choose a particular solution from the obtained set of 
non-dominated solutions, an Euclidean distance 
metric from an ideal reference solution z (marked 
as red ‘• ’) centered at the desired ROA in Fig. 4 is 
calculated for the non-dominated solutions. 
Solution X* (marked as + in Fig. 4) closest to this 
reference solution z is then chosen as the desired 
one, corresponding to the tolerance controller  
s
ssC 055871.013535.0)( +=  
, which results in extremal phase margins of  
 
°= 68.49smallestPM  and °= 71.75arg estlPM  
, respectively, as demonstrated in the Bode 
envelope in Fig. 5.  
 
 
6. Conclusions 
The problem of designing tolerance controllers for 
an interval plant satisfying a set of performance 
specifications in terms of acceptability ranges of 
gain margin and phase margin is generally difficult 
by conventional deterministic design methods. By 
formulating the design problem as constrained 
optimization problems, the proposed MOGA-based 
approach evolutionarily derives the tolerance 
controllers, preventing the difficulties encountered 
by conventional gradient-based optimization 
methods. To effectively handle the constraint 
violations during the evolution process, a penalty 
function is designed and incorporated into the 
fitness evaluation function in such a way that 
chromosomes corresponding to a larger 
accumulated sum of positive real part in the roots of 
the associated generalized Kharitonov segment 
polynomials receive heavier penalty. Because of the 
cost functions, evolution is directed toward 
derivation of Pareto optimal solutions with better 
centrality and limited spreading along the desired 
region of acceptability, resulting in more consistent 
system performances and improved robustness of 
the closed-loop system. Conventional design 
constraints on higher-order interval plants and 
controller order are therefore removed. In general, 
tolerance controllers can be obtained within a 
moderate number of iterations by using the 
proposed approach without suffering from the 
inherent shortcomings. As demonstrated in the 
illustrated examples, the proposed approach 
provides a simple yet practical way in the design of 
tolerance controllers for uncertain interval systems, 
where complex mathematical derivations are 
effectively circumvented. Nyquist plots of the 32 
extremal systems and time responses of the 
resulting closed-loop system have confirmed the 
validity of the evolutionarily derived controllers.
