一、中文摘要
自從 Joux 於 ANTS2000 年提出一高效率之三方式金鑰協議開始，三方
式金鑰協定 的設計、安全分析、及理論證明便成為重要且眾多關注的資安
研究主題之一。由於三方式金鑰認證方便一般三人式會議的金鑰分配，並對
於一般電子商務中兩人通訊應用也可提供第三方公正稽核及監控，因此對一
般電子商務通訊有極大影響。然而，關於此一主題雖然已有相當論文發表，
但仍存在下列主要問題待進一步研究：(1) 現存機制的安全、匿名性、應用
及效率仍有相當改良空間; (2)內部攻擊的問題一直被嚴重忽略，以致影響
其實際應用; (3) 現有少數針對三方式金鑰的分析模型及理論證明嚴重忽
略內部攻擊 (insider attack)。
(1) 現存機制的安全、匿名性、應用及效率仍有相當改良空間
Joux 機制無法抵擋中間者攻擊(the man-in-the-middle attack)、 Shim
(2003b) 指出 Nalla-Reddy 機制的弱點、Cheng et al. (2004) 指出
Al-Riyma-Paterson 機制弱點、Sun and Hsieh (2003) 指出 Shim 機制的金鑰
洩密之偽造問題(the key compromise impersonation attack)。但我們仍進一步
指出 Xie, Shim, LHL, Cheng et al, TAKC-STS, NR. ZLK 等機制的其他弱點
並進一步改良。其它像是匿名性保護、N 方式金鑰協定設計及協定的應用也
是重要研究議題。
(2)內部攻擊的問題一直被嚴重忽略，以致影響其實際應用
三方式金鑰協議的重要應用之一即是利用第三者做線上稽核、監督及裁
判，因此對每一參與者(包括第三者)的確實認證及實際參與確認便很重要；
否則，若有內部攻擊者偽造另一參與者將造成極大風險及損失。然而可能基
於如下原因，內部攻擊問題一直被嚴重忽略：(1) 相較於過去其它研究而
言，此一領域雖發展極快但仍算新領域；(2)過去植基於雙方式金鑰協議的
研究經驗無法涵蓋所有三方式金鑰的安全需求; (3) 一般的正規分析及理
論證明很難 模擬(model)及分析內部攻擊者。針對此一過去研究弱點，我們
3show the weaknesses of the NR scheme, Xie’s scheme, the LHL scheme, Cheng et
al.’s schemes, and the ZLK schemes.
(2) The insider attacks have been seriously neglected
Even though many security weaknesses of previous tripartite key agreement
protocols have been analyzed and improved, the insider attack have been seriously
neglected. The possible reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) The study of tripartite
key agreement protocols is still new to the research community, and the properties
need to be further studied; (2) the published security analysis on tripartite cases are
based on the experience and result from the two-party cases, and the results do not
cover all the possible threats on the tripartite cases; (3) There are few works or even
none addressing formal attack model, security definitions, and formal proof that cover
the insider attack for the tripartite cases.
The insider attack on a tripartite key agreement protocol means that one of the
three entities (say, A, B and C) impersonates the other one to the third one. For
example, B might try to fool A that they and C are participating in a protocol
run, while in fact C does not. This attack could have serious consequences: for
example, if C acts as an on-line escrow agent, an auditor or a referee (Joux 2000). If
B could impersonate C to A, then B can communicate with or performing transactions
with A; while A would do the transactions or communications only if C (the referee) is
monitoring the contents on-line. With no referee involved, this might cause serious
risk for A. We, therefore, have pointed out this weaknesses [A-35, 37, 41,42] [B-18,
19, 24].
(3) The few formal models and security proofs do not consider the insider
attacks, key-compromise impersonation attacks
Ai-Riyama and Paterson (2003) had proved the security of one of their protocols
in a formal model; however, the model only allows passive adversary. The
Canetti-Krawczyk proof model (2001) allows different components to be proved
secure separately, and then joins together to provide a secure key exchange. A
protocol is first proved secure in their AM model (transmission in authenticated
channels), and then authenticators are applied on the protocol to derive a secure
protocol in the UM model (transmission in public channels). This approach leads to a
simpler, less error-prone proofs and the ability to construct a large number of secure
protocols from a small much smaller number of basic secure components. Hichcock et
al. (2004) had modified the model to cover the tripartite cases and had designed
secure tripartite protocols. However, the insider attacks and the key-compromise
impersonation attack are not considered in the model since each participating entity
always follows the protocols and a session with a corrupted entity is not considered as
5public keys in the second round. Here, the signature is based on Hess’s ID-based
signature scheme [8].

We define the security of tripartite key agreement scheme as follows.
Definition 1 (Secure tripartite key agreement protocol): A tripartite key agreement
protocol is secure in our model if the following thee requirements are satisfied:
74. Self evaluation and discussions
We have examined the security properties of existing ID-based tripartite key
agreement protocols and ID-based two-party key agreement protocols, and have
shown the weaknesses of several existing schemes. We also have improved the
schemes, and proved the security in the random oracle model.
We have pointed out the weaknesses of the Yoon-Yoo scheme- failure of
committing user anonymity. To conquer all the weaknesses that bother all the previous
schemes, we have proposed a new scheme that can achieve authenticated key
exchange and preserve user anonymity. Our proposed scheme is also more efficient
than the Yoon-Yoo scheme in terms of computational complexity, and the security is
proved in a modified Bellare-Rogaway model.
We have discussed the infra-structure support property, the poor connectivity
property, the anonymity property and the possible resource-limited property of mobile
ad hoc networks. Based on ID-based cryptosystem from pairings, we have proposed
our key agreement protocols with anonymity, and have proved the security in our
model. The merits of our proposed schemes include: (1) there is no requirement of
on-line server support, (2) the protocols are efficient, and (3) the protocols preserve
the entities’ anonymity. These features make them very attractive to mobile ad hoc
networks.
