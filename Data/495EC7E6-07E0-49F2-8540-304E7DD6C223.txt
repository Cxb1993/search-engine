Abstract 
Antenna is one of the most important 
components of a system. RFID (Radio 
Frequency Identification) systems are 
receiving an interest in various commercial 
communication systems. Generally, the large 
or expensive commodity was design with 
RFID system for commodity’s management 
but the cheap one was absent. However, the 
commodity’s management was very 
important day by day in the future era. 
Actually, there are still many problems in the 
practical application in RFID system. The 
main problems are the price of RFID tag and 
the antenna performance. The published 
paper in RFID antenna is design with single 
frequency only. So the concept of a novel 
high frequency ratio RFID antenna and 
optimal gain the RFID tag system will be 
extensively studied here. We try to design 
dual-frequency antenna and optimal gain in 
the ground plane, which is inverted in the 
top of portable device. Such design ground 
plane can be retaining low profile and easy 
fabrication advantages. This present project 
will be studied on dual RFID band with high 
frequency ratio antennas to overcome the 
two main problems of the RFID tag system.

dB), 0.75 % for the frequency f1 and 5.5 % 
for the frequency f2 has been obtained. The 
frequency ratio in this design dual-frequency 
operation is about 180. The rectangular-
spiral-shaped portion and the meander-
shaped portion had a total length of 2573 
mm and 31 mm, respectively. The 
corresponding resonant frequency 
characteristic using in RFID are also listed in 
Table 1 for reference. The radiation patterns 
characteristics were also studied. Figure 4 
show the measured radiation patterns at the 
centre operating frequencies of f1 and f2, 
respectively. Measurements at other 
frequencies within the two operating bands 
were also conducted, and the measured 
results across each operating band showed 
similar radiation patterns as those given in 
Figure 4. From the measured results, it is 
seen that, in the x-y plane, the radiation 
patterns are closer to omni-directional 
radiation patterns and the cross-polarization 
levels are at least 25-dB lower. Also, the 
proposed antenna nearly shows a monopole-
like radiation pattern. 
 
Conclusions 
A high frequency ratio RFID antenna has 
been proposed and studied. The two 
operating frequencies are associated with the 
rectangular-spiral-shaped portion and the 
meander-shaped portion, with the length of 
the proposed being about 0.23λ and 0.5λ, 
respectively. Owing to the printing of the 
proposed antenna at an appropriate 
arrangement, the excited resonant frequency 
ratio is about 180 with two different 
operation mechanisms using in RFID 
antenna. Relatively bandwidths of the two 
frequencies are about 0.75 % for the lower 
operating frequency and 5.5 % for the higher 
operating frequency, it is enough for RFID 
tag’s antenna application.
