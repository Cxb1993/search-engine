The computational requirement of FFT, DFT and 
Goertzel algorithms for DTMF detection is listed as below: 
 
 FFT with 
N Points 
DFT with 
8 Points 
Goertzel with 
8 Points 
+: Adder 3N*log2N (2N-2)*8 (2N+1)*8 
*: Multiply 2N*log2N 2N*8 (1N+2)*8 
Total 5N* log2N 32N-16 24N+24 
Total(N=16) 320 496 408 
Total(N=32) 800 1008 792 
Total(N=64) 1920 2032 1560 
Total(N=128) 4480 4080 3096 
 
In the above table, some conclusions of DTMF 
detection can be founded. 
 
1. FFT outputs spectrum value with N points. However,  
DFT and Goertzel algorithm outputs only 1 point. 
3. FFT is superior than the others when N<=16. 
4. Goertzel is superior than the others when N>=32. 
5. In the case of DTMF detection, 8 spectrum points must 
be estimated. The balance equation between FFT and 
Goertzel is listed as below:

6. The value of N must be an integer power of 2 for FFT. 
7. The value of N must be large enough for the precision. 
8. The length DTMF signal must be large than 
40ms(N>=320). 
9. The Goertzel algorithm is the best solution for DTMF 
detection. 
 
However, the DTMF signal is a band-pass signal. The 
frequency located within ±1.5% of the nominal DTMF 
frequency about which the filter operates must be accept. 
The frequency outside the ±3.5% of the nominal DTMF 
frequency about which the filter operates must be rejected. 
Thus, the Goertzel algorithm in the DTMF detection must 
be done for some frequency sample points. For example, the 
filter length of Goertzel filter is 512 sample points and the 
sample rate is 8000 Hz. The detection margin of signal is set 
as ±2.5% who is satisfied with ITU’s specification. The 
1477 Hz signal is take as example. The detection margin of 
frequency is 1477Hz ±2.5%. This frequency margin can be 
rewritten as [1440Hz ~ 1514Hz]. In the 512-DFT structure, 
the frequency value(Hz) can be converted into frequency 
index(k). The above frequency margin can be rewritten as 
frequency index margin [ 92.16 ~ 96.9 ]. Thus, the spectrum 
value at the frequency index k=92, 93, 94, 95, 96 and 97 
must be estimated using the Goertzel algorithm. The 
computation requirement for 1477 Hz and Goertzel 
algorithm is 6*(2N-2) adder and 6*(2N) multiplies. The 
frequency margin of 1477Hz signal and the Goertzel filter 
are drawn as below. Obviously, the spectrum value X(k) 
must be estimated at k=92~97 for the 1477 Hz signal. Thus, 
in the real case, the computation requirement of Goertzel 
algorithm for each single tone will become 6 times. The 
Goertzel filter and the detection margin of 1477 Hz are 
listed as below. The bandwidth of Goertzel filter is not wide 
enough for the detection margin of 1477Hz±2.5% signal. 
 
 
 
In this project, a modified DFT algorithm is proposed 
to reduce the computation requirement of DTMF detection. 
The precision of the modified DFT algorithm is still same as 
DFT and Goertzel algorithms. However, the computation 
requirement is reduced dramatically. Detail description and 
experimental results will be given in the following sections.  
 
 
2. THE MODIFIED DFT ALGORITHM 
 
For the single tone detection, the Goertzel algorithm is 
superior than DFT algorithm. The Goertzel requires 3N+3 
operations and the DFT requires 4N-2 operations. The N is 
the size of DFT and the length of Goertzel filter.  
However, the work of DTMF detection is for single 
tone only. The frequency located within ±2.5% of the 
nominal DTMF frequency about which the filter operates 
must be detected. The bandwidth of Goertzel filter is not 
wide enough to match the frequency margin of ±2.5%. Thus, 
multiple Goertzel filter must be applied to match the 
frequency margin of ±2.5%. 
Moreover, the Goertzel algorithm is a recursive 
equation. Two recursive equations can’t be merged and 
simplified. But the DFT algorithm is a linear equation. The 
equation of DFT can be merged and simplified easily. For 
example, the spectrum point X(k) with k=92~97 can be 
simplified as following equation.

In the real operation, the right-side of Goertzel filter don’t 
need to estimate for the first N-1 sample. However, the 
right-side must be done at the last point y[N-1]. The total 
computation result is listed as below: 
 
Adder(+):     N*2+1=2N+1 
Multiply(*): N*1+2=N+2 
 
The transfer function of Goertzel filter is same as DFT. 
Thus, in the DTMF detection case, the total computation is 
listed as below: 
 
Adder(+):     (2N+1)*M*L 
Multiply(*): (N+2)*M*L 
 
  
4. CONCLUSION 
 
In the past, the Goertzel algorithm is the best solution 
for the DTMF detection. However, due to the specification 
of DTMF detection from ITU, the bandwidth of Goertzel 
filter can’t match to the margin ±2.5%. Multiple Goertzel 
filter are needed for the margin ±2.5%. However, it will 
need more computation. The modified DFT(MDFT) 
algorithm is proposed to avoided the multiple filter structure. 
The computation is reduced dramatically. Moreover, the 
precision of detection is still same as DFT. 
The modified DFT is firstly  proposed in this project. 
Those computational analysis confirms the good 
performance of MDFT for the DTMF detection.
