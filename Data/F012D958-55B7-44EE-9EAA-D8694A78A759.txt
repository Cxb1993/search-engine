Abstract 
The purposes of this project are to weld dissimilar metals joints, AA6061 aluminum alloy and 
SS400 low carbon steel, and to find the optimum operating conditions of friction stir welding 
(FSW). In the dissimilar FSW procedure, there were four major controllable factors, i.e., the tool 
rotation speed, transverse speed (feed rate), tool tilt angle with respect to the workpiece surface and 
pin tool diameter. The major quality of dissimilar metals butt joints is evaluated by impact value. 
Additionally, two of uncontrollable parameters are ultimately tensile strength and micro-Vicker’s 
hardness. However, in this project, the quality of dissimilar metals butt joints for analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) is evaluated by impact value only. ANOVA is the statistic method used to 
interpret these experimental data assigned to the L18 orthogonal arrays. Taguchi technique with 
ANOVA is used to find out the significant variables (factors) for the performance characteristic. 
Totally, there are two international conference papers which are produced from this project so 
far. The results are preparing to submit to SCI/EI journals. Please refer these details in the last page.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The steel material is inexpensive. Its strength and toughness are extremely high and superior. The 
steel becomes engineers the first option material. In general, the specific weight and stiffness of 
aluminum alloys, in the car industry, are only about one third of steel respectively. The aluminum 
alloy has an excellent specific weight property, so that aluminum alloy is used massively in the air 
transportation vehicles. The overland and the aquatic transportation machines for their weight 
reduction are the great expectations. Therefore, aluminum alloys will utilize and be helpful very 
much in the overland or the aquatic transportation machines to reduce their weight. Furthermore, 
the steel material and the aluminum alloys welded joint technical demand may be generated. For 
examples, the vehicles main structure like the steel made chassis module but the secondary 
structural element may change to be the aluminum alloy materials. The aquatic transportation 
vehicles prefer the steel and aluminum alloys made hull. Under water surface is steel part but on the 
water surface is possible to use the aluminum alloys. This structure can be not only lower the center 
of gravity of the vehicles but also achieves the reduction of their weight. 
Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a novel material joining technique invented [1] by the welding 
Institute (TWI) in 1991, which can produce superior mechanical properties in the weld zone. The 
joining does not involve any use of filler metal and therefore any aluminum alloy can be joined 
without concern for the compatibility of composition, which is an issue in fusion welding. In FSW 
process as presented by Chien et al. [2], [3], a non-consumable rotating tool with a specially 
designed pin and shoulder is inserted into the abutting edges of sheets or plates to be joined and 
traversed along the line of joint. The heat is generated between the wear resistant welding tool and 
  
 
 3
6/7/8 mm), as shown in Table 1, for analysis of variance. Their interactions are possible to be 
computed from above experimental data for analysis of variance.  
The desired characteristic of uncontrollable factors for the response can be measured by impact 
value for the L18 (2x33) as shown in Table 2. Based on the use of the impact value or ultimately 
tensile strength is the larger the better. However, ultimately tensile strength has been proved to be 
an excellent quality in our previous research. Therefore, in this project, the quality of dissimilar 
metals butt joints is evaluated by impact value only. 
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
In this work, there are four mainly controllable factors, i.e., four-level rotation speed (A; 550/800 
rpm), transverse speed (B; 0.9/1.2/1.5 mm/sec), tool tilt angle (C; 1/2/3 degree) and pin tool 
diameter (D; 6/7/8 mm), as shown in Table 1, for analysis of variance. The desired characteristic of 
uncontrollable factor for the response was measured by the C-notch Charpy impact values as shown 
in Table 2. Based on the use of the impact values is the larger the better.  
The ANOVA summary results of the C-notch Charpy impact values as shown in the Table 3. The 
results, with corresponding to at least 95% confidence, indicate that rotation speed and transverse 
speed are the relatively significant FSW process parameters, respectively. The significant factors 
can be identified from the values of their F ratios. The tool tilt angle and pin diameter are not 
relatively significant FSW process parameters for the C-notch Charpy impact values. 
 The most effect FSW process parameter for the C-notch Charpy impact values as shown in 
Table 4 is transverse speed. In the Table 4 and in the Fig. 3, the optimal FSW process for the impact 
quality is the combination of rotation speed 550 rpm, transverse speed 0.9 mm/sec, tool tilt angle 1 
degree and tool pin diameter 7 mm. The effect in the control factors is in order of transverse speed, 
rotation speed, tool pin diameter and tool tilt angle. The rotation speed 800 rpm gives the worst 
C-notch Charpy impact value. The transverse speed 0.9 mm/sec gives the best C-notch Charpy 
impact value. These may imply that the lower transverse speed and rotation speed will give the 
higher C-notch Charpy impact value. 
The specimens bending situation after the C-notch Charpy impact test are as shown in Fig. 5. The 
results indicate that the specimens of the rotational speed 550 rpm combined with 3 different 
transverse speeds have obvious plastic deformation before broken. The transverse speed 0.9 mm/sec 
gives the best quality. The specimen is bent to be 150 degree angle and still unbroken apart as 
shown in Fig. 5(a). In rotational speed 800 rpm case, the impact value is almost zero and brittle 
broken apart along the interface as shown in Fig. 5(b) for all of the transverse speeds. The smooth 
cleavage surfaces are brittle fractured. The parallel strips must be the scratch trace by the tool pin in 
the low-carbon steel. In the tough breaking area, many fragments of the steel were scattered in the 
aluminum alloy matrix as shown in Fig. 6(a). The magnified picture in the tough breaking area as 
shown in Fig. 6(b) reveals the structure like the coral reef.  
The bright area is composed of the steel fragments and welding zone center located. The cleavage 
line is tended to occur along the interface between the fragment and the aluminum matrix. In 
general, the aluminum alloy and steel intermetallic compound is possible to be produced. Thus, to 
reduce the production of the intermetallic compound from the aluminum alloy and steel is to 
conduct toward favor enhances their joints toughness. In this experiment, to reduce the rotational 
speed is to conduct toward favor enhances their impact values. Therefore, the small frictional 
thermal energy produced by the low rotational speed is not easy to generate the intermetallic 
compound.
