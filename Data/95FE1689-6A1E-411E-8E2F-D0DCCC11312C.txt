Abstract 
The fuselage ligament failure of aging airplanes appears to be serious problems for 
modern aircraft fleets. In an aircraft fuselage structure, multiple-site-damage (MSD) are 
often found in a collinear sense with a leading major crack accompanied by small MSD 
cracks emanating from rivet holes. In this paper, self-similar narrow strip Dugdale plastic 
model is invoked in the alternative iteration method for plastic zones estimation between 
adjacent cracks. Swift's ligament failure criterion is employed to predict the residual 
strength of MSD 2024-T3 aluminum thin panel. The crack tip opening displacement 
(CTOD) at the main crack tip is also suggested to assess multiple-crack failure scenarios 
for different MSD panels with their corresponding link-up loads. Thus, predictions on 
multiple-crack link-up loads and failure scenarios can be obtained, and which also give 
reasonable agreement with recently published experimental data.

1. Introduction 
After the Aloha accident in April 1988 [1] the significant impact of multiple site damage (MSD) 
has become a great concern. As a uniform stress field prevails in the fuselage structure, the MSD 
cracks generally emanate from several adjacent and collinear rivet holes in the longitudinal fuselage 
skin splice. The fracture characteristics of MSD are significantly different from the characteristics 
of a single-site crack. The different failure scenarios for a lead crack with neighboring smaller 
MSD cracks, as discussed by Schijve [2], show that small MSD cracks can significantly reduce the 
requirement of boundness at effective crack tips is applied, and that implies the vanishing of stress 
intensity factor at effective crack tips under such two loading systems. By applying the strip-yield 
model, the alternating successive iteration is employed to solve the stress field of MSD problem. 
An approximated average traction over each crack is used for calculating stress reflection. 
Alternating iteration is carried out until all the crack surfaces are free from traction, and that the 
crack interaction problem is solved.

2.1 Interactions of Multiple Dugdale Cracks 
For a symmetric MSD problem as shown in Fig. 1, the configuration consists of a large leading 
crack and two small MSD cracks. Besides, symmetric collinear aligned cracks have lengths of  
and  respectively. The MSD panel is loaded by uniform remote stress 
2a M
2aS S
∞ . The original 
multiple crack problem can be decomposed into two subproblems by extending the strip-yield 
model where the yield strength of the panel is denoted by σys . Sizes of tip plastic damage zones 
are ρM , ρS1  and ρS 2 . The half lengths of Dugdale type cracks are 
 cM = a M + ρM   (1)  
 cS = (2aS + ρS1 + ρS2 ) / 2  (2)  
In the iterative calculation proposed here, the initial sizes of tip plastic zones ( ρM , ρS1 and ρS 2) 
are roughly estimated. The stress intensity factors of two loading systems as depicted in Figures 1(b) 
and 1(c) must cancel each other as required in the assumption of strip-yield model. Due to 
symmetry of the configuration, only the stress intensity factors at crack tips 1, 2 and 3 are evaluated. 
The stress intensity factors for the case of Fig. 1(b) can be expressed in the form as

The solutions of Fig. 1(b) and 1(c) are reached for superposing its own initial solution and 
successive solutions in every iterations. Final solutions are achieved by superimposing iterated 
solutions in Figs 1(b) and 1(c). To avoid the link-up singularity difficulty in the proposed iterative 
calculation, cracks are considered linked as inner plastic zones are separated by minute distances 
(ε = L / 100 ), where L is the distance between adjacent crack tips as depicted in Fig. 4.

Kc for these 2024-T3 MSD panels is calculated to be 90 mMPa  that is averaged from results in 
P1, P2, and P3 cases. On the other hand, Hoysan and Sinclare [11] take the apparent fracture 
toughness of this material with identical thickness to be 110 mMPa . In this paper, nevertheless, 
Kc is assigned to be 100 mMPa  which is consistent to the identical material provided in 
link-up load P*. A symbol "F" is used in Fig. 2 and Table 1 to denote this type MSD failure in 
experiments. In these tests, case of P10 shows ( ) ctAt δδ <  at the leading crack tip but  
at the absorbed crack tip under the link-up load. As mentioned, an unstable crack absorption can 
take place in such case and a final MSD rupture may occur by just following the crack absorption. 
A stable crack absorption at the link-up load prevails for cases of P5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. For values

applied to introduce the second link-up or rupture. Failure scenarios for the second link-up are 
listed in Table 2, whereas the empirical failure scenario corresponds to the predicted results. In 
the second link-up, an ambiguous stability is observed for case of P8, which can be expected 
from the calculated data. Numerical results in the second plastic zones link-up reveals that the

testing configuration. Link-up loads (P*) for different MSD configurations have been reached in 
the corresponding numerical iterations and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. In the evaluation of the 
link-up load, the material flow strength is assumed to account for the strain hardening effect in 
experiments. Flow strength of 2024 Alclade is defined in following equation and is assigned as 
403 MPa.
