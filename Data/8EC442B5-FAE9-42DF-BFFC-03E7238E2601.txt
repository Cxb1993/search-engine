二. 摘要 
本計畫研究 Negative Biased Temperature Instability (NBTI)對 CMOS 電晶電路老化之影響，並開發
自動化的軟體工具進行電路受到 NBTI 所造成的老化現象分析，同時估計這些現象對系統產生的
Timing Degradation。此工具流程的重要性在於它能分析個別電晶體的老化以及系統上全部電路元
件。只要將電路的 RTL 敘述輸入到我們設計的工具流程，該電路邏輯閘的切換次數將被用來分
析個別元件的老化，並根據分析結果建立出 NBTI 電路元件造成影響的模型。由於以單晶片為基
礎的系統更加普遍，也日漸重要，本研究中將研究 On-Chip Bus 中個別元件的老化，其中有 Arbiter、
Decoder、Multiplexer 及 Link Buffer 的老化，並分析老化造成的 Timing Violations。在研究個別
元件老化的 現象之後，我們將提出一個能動態捕捉到 Timing Degradation 的機制，同時改良匯流
排架構，在發生能危害系統正常運作的 Timing Degradation 時，能啟動反應機制，以維持系統正
確的功能。 
 
三. 報告內容 
對使用 On-Chip Bus 的系統單晶片來說，On-Chip Bus 為系統各元件溝通的橋樑，因此它的可靠
性影響了系統單晶片的可靠性。在更先進的製程下，NBTI(Negative Bias Temperature Instability) 及
HCE (Hot Carrier Effect)兩者皆會使電晶體的 Threshold Voltage 增加，為影響積體電路可靠性的
主要因素。本研究評估NBTI及HCE對On-Chip Bus電路老化的影響。我們開發NBTI(Negative Bias 
Temperature Instability) 及 HCE (Hot Carrier Effect)綜合分析架構來研究下個業界標準 On-Chip 
Shared Bus 受老化的影響。我們將分析 On-chip Bus 個別元件的老化，其中包含 Arbiter、
Multiplexer、Decoder。在研究個別元件老化的現象之後，我們將探討數種可減緩老化或恢復系統
效能的機制。

二、目的 
參與在日本福岡舉行為期三天的 International Symposium 
onLow Power Electronics and Design 低功率電子及設計國際
研討會並發表論文，從 8 月 1 日到 8月 3 日期間共舉辦多場的議
程包括 Contest、 Exhibits 和 Technical Sessions。此會議中
囊括了最新的技術內容以及該領域之商業交流活動，並藉由參與
此研討會所舉辦的不同議程瞭解近期的開發成果觀摩學習，同時
透過研討會中的 Exhibition 與參展的廠商討論最新的問題或是
發展的趨勢，本次發表的論文題目為 TG-based Tenique for NBIT 
Degradation and Leakage Optimization 
三、過程 
今年的低功率設計國際會議在日本福岡舉行，雖然日本東北
部受地震影響災情慘重，但南部沒有受太大的影響，因此會議在 8
月 1 日到 8 月 3 日如期舉行。 
此會議跟 International Symposium on Technology 
Innovation and Integration for Information Systems with 
Ultra-Low-Power (JST-CREST)同步舉行，包含有 Design 
Contests， Exhibits ，Technical Sessions等三種不同的議程。 
由於教育部頂尖計畫的補助，使得本人有機會參與本次會議，

 (from: top500.org) 
本次會議有來自世界各地二百三十篇的投稿，最多來自美國，
其次為日本，台灣則為第三。只有二十多篇的論文被接受為為Full 
Paper(Full 論文的接受率為 13%左右)，其他為 Short Paper 及
Poster。我們要發表的論文為 TG-based Technique for NBIT 
Degradation and Leakage Optimization 為 Full Paper，可見極
為難得。 
四、心得及建議事項 
   近幾年來，處理器的設計正從提高頻率轉為降低功率導向，
為了在有限的功率下滿足更高的性能需求，多核心架構因應而生，
成為未來產業發展的趨勢。 
  為了達此目標，設計工程師致力於減少各個製程、運作環節
中會產生的功率，以避免被迫採用基礎設備系統來處理產生的熱
量。本次會議中即討論到許多降低功率的設計方法，並提供靈活

Dear Ing-Chao,
Thank you for submitting your work to GLSVLSI 2011. This year we have received a
large amount of high quality papers and we expect a very successful event in
Lausanne.
It is our pleasure to inform that your paper titled
Analyzing Throughput of Power and Thermal-constraint Multicore Processor under NBTI Effect
has been accepted for publication in the proceedings and will be presented in
GLSVLSI 2011 as a POSTER.
Please, find below the feedback of the reviewers to your work. Please, try to
address these comments and upload the final version of your paper before March
1st. The website will be open again (through
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=glsvlsi2011) to allow the submission
of a new version.
Looking forward to seeing you in Lausanne. Yours,
Jose L. Ayala and Ken Stevens
Program Chairs
---------------------------- REVIEW 1 --------------------------
PAPER: 155
TITLE: Analyzing Throughput of Power and Thermal-constraint Multicore Processor under NBTI Effect
OVERALL RATING: -1 (weak reject)
The paper seems to be an interesting extension/continuation of the two papers [1] and [2] considering the NBTI
effect
on a multicore architecture.
Despite of presented results are interesting, the evaluations presented in the paper are not based on
simulations.
This can be noted especially in the “Load Balance” section (3.2.1) where the results are not clear at all and
practically
this solution is not covered. In fact the solution proposed by the author is not a load balancing technique but only
a
selection of the fastest cores.
Moreover at the end of the section, there is a sentence saying that the “load balance can be used to improve the
effectiveness of this technique”, but this is not explained at all.
In the title the author refers to “Thermal-Constraint Multicore”, but it is very difficult to find this in the paper. The
temperature has a great effect on the problems faced by the paper but this relation is not considered at all.
There isn’t a real State of the art section. This is a lack of the paper since a similar section helps the reader in
the
contextualization of the work and in understanding the novel contribution of the paper.
