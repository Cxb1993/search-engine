ABSTRACT 
 
In this study, the dynamic behaviors of two rotor-bearing systems with ball end 
milling are investigated, and the system parameters including the cutting force 
coefficients and the equivalent parameters (mass, damping and stiffness) are identified. 
One of the rotor systems is supported by bearings with squeeze film. The cutting force 
coefficients including the shear force coefficients and the edge force coefficients, and 
the cutting parameters including the shear stress, friction angle, and chip ratio are thus 
derived from the identified shear force coefficients.  
The effects of design parameters on system dynamic behaviors including critical 
speeds, Von-Misses stress and stability under the dynamic cutting forces are 
numerically solved in the time domain. The results show that the critical speeds are 
proportional to corresponding system natural frequencies, but inversely to the cycle 
number of tool vibration multiplying the number of flutes during the cutting time 
from one flute to another. Furthermore, the chatter stability lobes are studied for 
various cutting conditions. The effects of squeeze film bearing (SFB) on system 
dynamic behaviors are also discussed. It is formed that the ratio between length and 
radius of SFB can significantly affect the system behaviors. 
The cutting force coefficients are identified from the end milling by using the 
recursive least square method (RLS) and the average cutting force method (ACF). 
Then the cutting forces in the end milling and the ball end milling are predicted from 
the cutting parameters and the edge force coefficients. The equivalent mass, damping 
and stiffness parameters of the rotor system are identified by using Fourier transform

surface finish as well as the dimensional accuracy of workpiece.  
Linear system is usually considered when the responses of tool tip are small under 
the light cutting forces. However, the effect of nonlinear system would appear in a 
bigger way, and so is the resonance. Furthermore, some researchers have devoted to 
establish the dynamic linear cutting forces model and the responses of linear rotor 
system but the dynamic behaviors of nonlinear rotor system in the ball end milling 
with nonlinear cutting force are rarely discussed. 
The system parameters for ball end milling include the equivalent parameters 
(mass, damping and stiffness), cutting parameters and edge force coefficients. The 
cutting forces can be measured from experiment. It is difficult to obtain the real mass, 
damping, and stiffness from experiment, so the equivalent mass, damping and 
stiffness in single degree of freedom are usually used to simplify the system model 
and thus the tool tip responses are more easily predicted. Although several researchers 
have devoted to establish the cutting forces model, the equivalent mass, damping, and 
stiffness parameters of the rotor system in ball end milling are rarely discussed. 
After select cutting conditions in ball end milling, the cutting forces can be 
predicted from identification of cutting parameters and edge force coefficients. The 
responses of tool tip can be calculated by using the numerical simulation under the 
cutting forces for the constant system equivalent parameters (mass, damping, and 
stiffness) and system with squeeze film bearing effects. If these responses are within 
the specified criteria then the cutting conditions are proper in this milling.

combination of the force function determines the cutting force at arbitrary tool 
position. The method is based on the projection of the cutting load area onto the 
reference coordinate. Owing to the analytical integration of the cutting forces along 
the cutter edge, the developed closed form equations provide an easy way for 
calculating the cutting forces. Abrari et al. [14] presented a dynamic force model and 
conducted a stability analysis for ball end milling. The dynamic deflections are 
determined by measured transfer function using a lumped parameter model for the 
tool/spindle with a two-degree of freedom linear system. Altintas and Lee [15] and 
Engin and Altintas [16] presented the mechanics and dynamics of cutting for ball end 
milling and end milling process respectively. Simulations in time domain were 
performed by considering the instantaneous regenerative chip load, local cutting force 
coefficients and measured structural transfer functions with a one-degree of freedom 
linear system. Shalta et al. [17] used the predictive machining theory of orthogonal 
cutting, developed by Oxley [18] to analyze the ball end milling process. Zhu et al. 
[19] reported a ball end milling process model for machining free-form surfaces. 
Their cutting force coefficients were determined using the average cutting forces and 
average process conditions following the work of Kline et al. [2]. Bailey et al. [20] 
built a 3D cutting force model, in which the cutting force coefficients were 
determined using average cutting forces. Also, Lazoglu et al. [21- 23] established a 
closed form model for ball-end milling in the frequency domain. Sadeghi et al. [24] 
developed a ball end milling process simulation system which parameters were 
obtained from modal testing. The physical simulator is equipped with an orthogonal 
data based rigid force model as well as regenerative dynamic force model that 
predicts dynamic forces and tool tip deflections. Faassen et al. [25] reported that a

Besides the above researches, there are different investigations of the cutting 
forces in recent years. Zuperl et al. [32] used the artificial neural networks approach to 
evolve an model for estimation of cutting forces. Yang et al. [33] proposed analytical 
approach to detect depth-of-cut variations based on the cutting-force shape 
characteristics in end milling. Chen et al. [34] presented the mode, simulation and 
experimental verification of the scallop formulation on the machined surface in the 
ball-end milling process. Chen [35] used the model proposed by Wang to investigate 
the cutting force coefficients for milling Inconel-718 and Mar247. 
In past years, many papers have proposed methods to estimate the coefficients of 
a structural system. Stanway et al. [36-37] utilized parametric identification 
techniques and experimental data to estimate dynamic coefficients. This method fits 
experimental input-output data with an assumed mathematical model to identify the 
system model in a least-squares sense. Ellis et al. [38] utilize the state variable filter. It 
is shown that the method referred to as sequential least square estimation is applicable 
to identify the bearing coefficients. Nieto and Guerrero [39] derived the Kalman filter 
equations when the system state and the observation error of a state-space are 
correlated, which consider error processes with nonnegative definite 
variance-covariance matrices and disturbance probability that are conditional on some 
information related to the observation process. Cicci [40] showed that the 
performances of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an adaptive EKF in tracking a 
target vehicle using various measurement types from space-based observers. The 
adaptive EKF incorporates ridge type estimation methods to improve the accuracy 
obtained by the standard EKF. Simon [41] showed that Mamdani-type fuzzy systems 
can be viewed as an identification problem for a nonlinear dynamic system. This

tooth. The deflection, cutting force, and Von-Misses stress of tool are investigated 
during milling operation in two cases of the system (Case I Tool and Case II Rotor 
System with Tool). The chatter stability lobes and some appropriate criterions are 
determined with cutting condition in various tool sizes, workpiece materials and 
precision. Under high speed and federate cutting, the squeeze film bearing can be 
considered to reduce the system vibration level. 
The cutting force coefficients including the shear force coefficients and the edge 
force coefficients are identified by using the ACF and the RLS. The cutting 
parameters are derived from the identified shear force coefficients. From the cutting 
parameters and the edge force coefficients, the cutting forces under different feed per 
flute are calculated and compared graphically with those measured from the 
experiment. As to the identification of the equivalent mass, damping and stiffness 
parameters, the tool deformed as bending mode in milling is considered as a single 
degree of freedom model for rotor system. The FTF, EKF, and DKF methods are 
employed to identify the equivalent parameters of the rotor system through the 
measured displacements of tool tip and the identified cutting forces.

motivation and the object of present research are clearly stated, and the literature

are described that the sections of ball end milling involve the static cutting forces, and

CHAPTER 2  
MODELING OF CUTTING FORCES 
 
The cutting force model of ball end mill and end mill proposed by Altintas et al. 
[9-12] are employed in this work. The cutting forces include the shear force and edge 
force. By carrying out a set of cutting tests with end mill, the cutting forces 
coefficients are obtained. The cutting parameter of a workpiece, such as the shear 
stress, the friction angle and the chip ratio are calculated from the shear force 
coefficients. Then, substitute the above cutting parameters and the edge forces 
coefficients into the cutting forces model of ball end mill and predict the cutting 
forces in ball end mill processing. 
In section 2-1, the relation between chips and cutting forces is described in this 
section. The cutting force model of ball end mill is shown in section 2-2 in which 
includes the static cutting forces, dynamic cutting forces and nonlinear dynamic 
forces. In section 2-3, the cutting forces model of ball end mill is expressed. The 
prediction of the cutting parameters material is shown in section 2-4. 
2.1 Relation of Chip and Cutting Forces 
The milling process is an interaction between the tool and the workpiece. The 
shavings that be moved from the surface of a workpiece is so called the “Chip” which 
show in Fig.2-1. However, the chip and the cutting force are closely bound up. The 
cutting forces are separated into the shear forces )( cF

 and the edge forces )( eF

which show in Fig.2-2. The shear force is caused by the plastic deformation of the

hemisphere, and is ground with a constant helix lead. The flutes have helix angle 0I  
at the ball-shank meeting boundary. Due to the reduction of the radius at the x-y 
planes towards the ball tip in the axial z -direction, the local helix angle )(I  along 
the cutting flute varies for constant helix-lead cutters. The expression for the envelope 
of the ball part is given by

2.2.3 Dynamic Cutting Forces 
The tool vibrations enlarge as the cutting forces increase, and the instantaneous 
chip thickness is affected by the tool vibrations to make the dynamic cutting forces in 
this milling process. The instantaneous chip thickness derived by Ko and Cho [26] is 
employed and expanded as follows

3.4 Results and Discussions  
In this study, there are two sets of corresponding two radiuses of tool, 1.5 mm
(R1.5) and 12 mm(R12), are used and listed in Table 3-1. 
In the Case I, the dynamic responses of tool radius 1.5 mm  are shown in Fig. 3-3 
where spindle speeds are 2440 rpm, 24400 rpm, 30000 rpm and 36570 rpm 
respectively. At 24400 rpm and 36570 rpm, when spindle speeds are identical with 
critical speeds (24326 rpm and 36490 rpm); resonance occurs. At 2440 rpm, when 
spindle speed is identical with critical speed 2432 rpm ( km =30), system obviously 
cannot excite resonance. The reason is that the amplitudes of vibration are reduced to 
decrease strain energies owing to km  increasing. As to 30000 rpm, the system cannot 
excite resonance because of this spindle speed not being a critical speed. 
The dynamic responses of tool radius 12 mm  are shown in Fig. 3-6 where spindle 
speeds are 3000 rpm, 4050 rpm, 5000 rpm and 6000 rpm respectively. At 3000 rpm, 
4050 rpm and 6000 rpm of the spindle speeds occurs resonance.  
The analyses of dynamic cutting forces are shown in Fig. 3-4 where 24000 rpm 
and 36000 rpm can be called critical speeds, and the dynamic cutting forces are 
apparently increased during the process of milling as time goes by. Hence the

30 
 
The tool radiuses are still set at 1.5 mm  and 12 mm , and corresponding data of 
spindle are mmL 218 , 157a mm , 46.182gl mm , 850GI
2mmton  , 
kgmG 6.20 , mmNkA /108.0
6  and mmNkB /1002.1
6 . The consequences 
of numerical simulation for dynamic responses are calculated as follows. 
The natural frequencies and eigenvectors of tool R1.5 in Case II are expressed in 
Table 3-4. It is shown that the value of DY  in eigenvector is the largest at the mode 3 
and mode 4. The dynamic rigidity of these modes is weaker, but the mode 4 (51966Hz) 
can be ignored because its frequency is much higher than others. Therefore, the 
dynamic behaviors of system should be discussed based on mode 3. 
The dynamic responses of tool radius 1.5 mm  are shown in Fig. 3-10 where 
spindle speeds are 26400 rpm, 35200 rpm, 40000 rpm and 52750 rpm respectively. At 
35200 rpm and 52750 rpm of the spindle speeds occurs resonance. Compared with 
Case I, the critical speeds are higher with increasing natural frequency. The analyses 
of Von-Misses stress are shown in Fig. 3-11. The stresses of tool can be increased 
during milling at 35200 rpm and 52750 rpm. 
The natural frequencies and eigenvectors of tool R12 are expressed in Table 3-6. 
The results show that the value of DY  in the eigenvector is the largest for mode 1, 2 
and 4 so that the dynamic rigidity of these modes are weak; however, the mode 4 
(8731.2 Hz ) can be ignored because its frequency is much higher than others. 
Therefore, the dynamic behaviors of system should be discussed on the basis of mode 
1 (636 Hz ) and mode 2 (998 Hz ). 
The dynamic responses of tool with regard to natural frequency 636 Hz  are 
shown in Fig. 3-12 where spindle speeds are 3180 rpm, 4240 rpm, 6360 rpm and 7000 
rpm respectively. Due to the 3180 rpm, 4240 rpm and 6360 rpm are critical speeds;

CHAPTER 4  
IDENTIFIED SYSTEM PARAMETERS 
 
The purpose of this paper is to study the identification of the rotor system 
parameters which include the equivalent parameters (mass, damping and stiffness) 
and the cutting force coefficients. The cutting force coefficients including the shear 
force coefficients and the edge force coefficients are identified by using the ACF and 
the RLS. The cutting parameters are derived from the identified shear force 
coefficients. From the cutting parameters and the edge force coefficients, the cutting 
forces under different feed per flute are calculated and compared graphically with 
those measured from the experiment. As to the identification of the equivalent mass, 
damping and stiffness parameters, the tool deformed as bending mode in milling is 
considered as a single degree of freedom model for rotor system. The FTF, EKF, and 
DKF methods are employed to identify the equivalent parameters of the rotor system 
through the measured displacements of tool tip and the identified cutting forces. 
4.1 Identified Methods 
4.1.1 Cutting Forces Coefficients 
The cutting forces in the ball end milling and the end milling are investigated. First, 
the cutting force coefficients are identified by using the end milling. Since the local 
helix angle ( )(I ) and the chip thickness ( h ) for the end milling remain constant 
along the cutting flute, the identification of the cutting force coefficients by using the 
end milling is more convenient than using the ball end milling. Then, the cutting

minimum values in the minimization of the error function are dependent on the initial 
guess. To overcome the difficulty, the Average Cutting Force Method is introduced. 
The Kˆ  obtained by using this method can be set as the initial guess in the RLS. 
Average Cutting Force Method (ACF)  The method proposed by Wang 
and Zheng [29] is employed. For end milling, the cutting force coefficients can be 
expressed as follows: 
First, the geometry of end mill is such as the chapter 2-3-1 described. From Eqn. 
(2-37), the local radial, tangential and axial cutting forces are transformed into 
Cartesian coordinates and shown in equation (4-2).

In general, in order to solve the average value of a period function, use the 
Fourier transformation to arrange the function into frequency domain. When 0 , 
the average value of a period function is equal to the value of this function in 
frequency domain. So, using the Fourier transformation to arrange Eqn. (4-6) and 
descried as follows.

The coefficient aeK  is usually smaller than other coefficients, so that aeK  is 
assumed as zero in this model. 
Contrary to the RLS, the initial values and the iteration process are not needed for 
the ACF. Though the identified cutting force coefficients are less accurate, those 
coefficients can be used as the initial values in the RLS and a better result can be

4.2 Experimental Methods 
4.2.1 Experimental Setup 
  The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4-1. In the milling process for cutting 
Aluminum 6061-T6, the cutting forces are measured by using the dynamometer 
(Kistler 9254) and A/D converter (Keithley DAS-16). The displacements of the tool 
tip are measured by using the CCD laser displacement sensor (Keyence LK-G35) and 
controller (Keyence LK-G3001V). The photographs of the experiment with reality in 
ball end milling are shown in Fig. 4-2 and Fig. 4-3. Finally, the components of the 
workpiece, the cutting tools and the equipments are listed as follows.

The displacements of the tool tip measured by laser displacement sensors can be 
used to perform the identification of system equivalent parameters. Owing to the chip 
effect, it is hard to measure the displacements of the tool tip with the equipment. The 
measured data through two laser sensors whose light project onto two different 
positions of the tool can be used to estimate the displacements of tool tip. The 
deformation of tool is assumed as a cantilever beam with forces load on its tip. 
Neglecting the axial deformation, one may express the deformation function of the 
tool as dczbzaz  23 ( Lz 0 ). By considering geometry of cantilever 
beam, 0   as 0z , so 0 dc . The first laser sensor is located at 
3
L
z  , 
and 1  , while the second laser sensor is located at 
3
2L
z  , and 2  . The 
symbol L  is the length of the tool. The coefficients a  and b can be determined by 
using the above two conditions. Then, the displacement of the tool tip is obtained as 
23 bLaL  . 
4.3 Results and Discussions 
In this chapter, the cutting force coefficients of Aluminum 6061-T6 and the 
equivalent system parameters (mass, damping and stiffness) are identified. The results 
and discussions of experiment and identification are summarized as follows:  
4.3.1 Cutting Forces  
In the identification of cutting force coefficients, the cutting tests with the end 
milling and the ball end milling are experimented by using the machining parameters 
listed in Tables 4-2 and 4-3. Five cases with different feed per flute, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 
0.12, and 0.14 mm/flute, are studied. 
Dynamic Behaviors and Identification Parameters of Rotor Systems  
with Squeeze Film Bearing for Ball End Milling 
 
 
50 
 
Concerning the case 1 to case 5 in Table 4-3 for the end milling, the measured 
cutting forces from the experiment and the predicted cutting forces from the identified 
cutting force coefficients by using the ACF and the RLS are compared and shown in 
Figs. 4-14 to 4-18. The results for the two modes including the half slot milling and 
the slot milling are plotted in Figs. 4-14(a) and 4-14(b) to 4-18(a) and 4-18(b). It is 
seen that the forces are almost zero at two segments for the half slot milling mode. 
This is a normal result for the half slot milling mode. From Figs. 4-14 to 4-18, the 
waveforms of these measured and predicted data are similar, except the amplitudes of 
the predicted cutting forces by using the ACF are mostly larger. The results of the 
experimental data and the RLS data are almost coincident, though there is 
high-frequency oscillation in the experimental data. Thus the presented average 
cutting force coefficients by using the ACF are not accurate enough.  
The cutting parameters include the shear stress  , the friction angle   and the 
chip ratio  , are computed with the identified cutting forces coefficients by using the 
RLS. The computed cutting parameters are shown in Table 4-5 and Fig. 4-19. Fig. 
4-19 shows that the shear stress decreases as the feed per flute increases. This 
phenomenon is observed by Hsu [47]. The shear stress decreases as the thickness of 
the uncut chip increases while the feed per flute is much smaller than the radius of 
tool. In this study, the shear stress can be mathematically formulated as 
25.1945.448  df . The friction angle   approaches to a constant of a mean 
value 0.6806. The friction angle is related to the rake angle in milling. Since the rake 
angle is given with a constant value of 8° in this study, the predicted friction angle is 
also a constant. Then, the chip ratio   is also close to a constant of a mean value 
0.3234. The chip ratio is a function of the rake angle in [10], so the identified chip

(4-17). Then, the dynamic responses of tool tip with the identified equivalent system 
parameters and cutting forces are calculated by using the numerical simulation. These 
results are listed in Table 4-7. It is found that for the fifth damping ratio ( 05.0 ), 
the maximum response of tool tip of numerical simulation is closest to that of 
experimental results. Employing this result and according to Eqn. (4-18), the 
equivalent system parameters can be determined as kgmx 122.1 , kgmy 2307.0 , 
05.0x , 05.0y , mmNkx /6.1118 , and mmNk y /01.927 .  
The equivalent system parameters using the DKF are calculated from the identified 
parameters, 1a , 2a , 3a , 1b , 2b , and 3b . And the equivalent system parameters 
using the EKF are calculated from the identified parameters, IIIz , IVz , and Vz . These 
equivalent system parameters using three methods are shown in Table 4-8. The 
dynamic responses of tool tip for this identified equivalent system parameters from 
numerical simulation are also compared with the experimental results as shown in Fig. 
4-26 and Fig. 4-27. It is found that the responses of tool tip from numerical simulation 
for FTF’s parameters are very similar to the measurements of experiment, but there is 
still a little difference such as the location of peak values. One possible explanation is 
that the whole system is simplified as single degree of system to form equivalent 
system parameters. The tool tip responses calculated from the identified parameters 
using the FTF and the EKF are similar to the measurements of experiment, however 
those using the DKF are not accurate enough. Their maximum displacements are 
lower than the measurements of experiment. Therefore, the FTF and the EKF are 
more suitable in comparison with the DKF for the identification of equivalent system 
parameters in this study.

simulation analysis. 
(3) The dynamic cutting force and Von-Misses stress are calculated during milling 
at the critical speed. The results show that the differences between critical 
speeds are increased with ratio of equality in the chatter stability lobes. It is 
because the critical speeds will be only influenced by a certain natural 
frequency. 
Case II Rotor System with Tool 
(1) As bearing effect is considered, the critical speeds of smaller radius tool (R1.5) 
are promoted; some other modes affect tool responses by using bigger radius 
tool (R12). The intervals between critical speeds don’t increased with ratio of 
equality in the chatter stability lobes for using a bigger one. 
(2) Under high speed and federate cutting, it is found that the short squeeze film 
bearing installed in the front position of spindle can be used to stiffen the 
system and reduce the dynamic responses. Furthermore, the dynamic 
behaviors at all critical speeds are stable in the case of DLs / =0.5. For the 
case of 25.0/ DLs , however, the difference between 1,kcr  and 2,kcr  is 
maximum, the range between two critical speeds elongates and 1,kcr  also 
approaches to be constant. Hence, the appropriate ratio DLs /  is around 0.25. 
The identified cutting forces and the associated responses of the tool tip from the 
identified equivalent system parameters are compared with the experimental data. The 
results are summarized as follows: 
(1) Using the ACF can rapidly identify the cutting force coefficients in the end 
milling, but the results are not accurate enough. It is suggested to use these 
coefficients as the initial values in the RLS. The trustworthy cutting force

responses of tool tip can be calculated by using the numerical simulation under the 
cutting forces for the constant system equivalent parameters (mass, damping, and 
stiffness) and system with squeeze film bearing effects. If these responses are within

英文： 
The system parameter for ball end milling including the cutting 
force coefficients and equivalent parameters (mass, damping and 
stiffness) can be identified by using various methods through the 
cutting forces and the tool tip displacements. The cutting forces are 
measured by the dynamometer, and the tool tip displacements can be 
obtained from measurements using two laser displacement sensors. By 
using numerical simulation, the critical speeds of system and the 
maximum dynamic responses of tool tip for various depth-of-cut and 
feed per tooth can be determined to avoid the chatter of ball end 
milling.  
After select cutting conditions in ball end milling, the cutting 
forces can be predicted from identification of cutting parameters and 
edge force coefficients. The responses of tool tip can be calculated by 
using the numerical simulation under the cutting forces for the constant 
system equivalent parameters (mass, damping, and stiffness) and 
system with squeeze film bearing effects. If these responses are within 
the specified criteria then the cutting conditions are proper in this 
milling.

freedom linear system. Altintas and Lee [7] and Engin and 
Altintas [8] presented the mechanics and dynamics of cutting for 
ball end milling and end milling process respectively. 
Simulations in time domain were performed by considering the 
instantaneous regenerative chip load, local cutting force 
coefficients and measured structural transfer functions with a 
one-degree of freedom linear system. Sadeghi et al. [9] 
developed a ball end milling process simulation system which 
parameters were obtained from modal testing. The physical 
simulator is equipped with an orthogonal data based rigid force 
model as well as regenerative dynamic force model that predicts 
dynamic forces and tool tip deflections. Faassen et al. [10] 
reported that a higher-order model is necessary to describe the 
machine dynamics by an experimental transfer function matrix 
between cutting forces and displacements of the cutter. 
Moreover, a method was developed for the prediction of the 
chatter boundaries as a function of process parameters, such as 
spindle speed and depth-of-cut for different material and 
machine parameters. Stepan et al. [11] used a classical 
regenerative vibration model to simplify discrete mathematical 
model for a nonlinear vibration in a high-speed milling. 
The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamic behaviors 
of tool and rotor system under the linear and nonlinear dynamic 
cutting forces of ball end milling during milling operation. The 
stability of rotor system is investigated. Moreover, the 
relationship between critical speeds and natural frequencies is 
discussed with respect to various depth-of-cut (axial) and feed 
per tooth in linear and nonlinear rotor systems. 
2 MODELING OF CUTTING FORCE 
2.1 Linear Dynamic Cutting Force: 
The linear cutting forces proposed by Lee and Altintas [5] are 
employed in this work. The elemental tangential, radial, and 
axial dynamic cutting forces tdF , rdF , adF  acting on the 
cutter are given by

where khkt ii
ˆsin)()ˆ,(    is the uncut chip thickness 
normal to the cutting edge and the angle kˆ  is defined in 
Nomenclature. )( ih  is instantaneous chip thickness, 
kdzdb ˆsin/  is differential cutting edge length in which dz  
is differential height in axial direction of tool. The acrctc KKK ,,  
are shear force coefficients and aerete KKK ,,  are edge force 
coefficients.  
If the position of the tool does not change much during the 
short cutting period ([9] and [11]), the chip thickness yields

where df  is feed per tooth, xe and ye  are eccentric 
displacements between tool and spindle in x and y direction 
respectively, )( jtx and )( jty  are deflections of tool tip at the 
present time, )( 1jtx  and )( 1jty  are deflections of tool tip at 
the previous time. i  is instantaneous angular immersion in

In this paper, a new model of the total force acting on the

coordinates, is proposed in terms of system response and 
expressed as follows:

and 6064rpm the resonance occurs because they are almost 
identical to system natural frequencies, these spindle speeds are 
called critical speeds. When the spindle speeds are 808.5 and. 
5000rpm, the system cannot excite resonance because these are 
not critical speeds. The relationship between the adjacent critical

The numerical results of Case I with 2fN , Hzfn 452 , 
and mmR 7.120   
are well compared to the experimental data 
by Altintas and Lee [7] under the same cutting conditions. The 
comparison is also shown in Table 2. For linear cutting force 
case with spindle speed at 5950rpm, 3fN , Hzfn 4.606 ,
mmR 0.30  , the dynamic response of tool tip for Case I and 
Case II are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for 1.0df and 
2.0df  
respectively. It can be seen that, when the feed per 
tooth ( df ) is increased, the corresponding cutting forces will be 
increased that will induce higher dynamic response of tool tip.

cycle of tool tip in rotor system with nonlinear spring effects is 
larger than the spindle speed 5950rpm for Case II (Fig. 5). This 
is because that the dynamic response is increased with large df  
in rotor system. The system stiffness will be softened and the 
critical speed is decreased.
 
Fig. 7 shows the maximum dynamic response of tool tip with 
various df  
and spindle speed from 5500rpm to 6500rpm under 
linear cutting force and nonlinear cutting force with constant 
system parameters (Case I and Case III). The results indicate 
that the critical speed is at 5950rpm under linear cutting force. 
However the critical speed is increased up to 6064rpm under 
nonlinear cutting force. This phenomenon is approximately the 
same both 1.0df  and 2.0df . It also shows that the 
maximum dynamic responses of tool under nonlinear cutting 
force at critical speed are higher than those of system with linear 
cutting force. This is because the nonlinear cutting forces are of 
higher magnitudes of nonlinear cutting force compared to those 
of linear cutting force. Both of the critical speeds of system 
under linear cutting force and nonlinear cutting force remain at a 
constant at any df , because the dynamic response of tool tip 
does not change system stiffness in constant system parameters. 
Fig. 8 shows the maximum dynamic response of tool tip with 
various df   and spindle speed under linear and nonlinear cutting 
forces in rotor system with nonlinear spring effect (Case II and 
Case IV). The results indicate that the critical speed is at 
5950rpm under linear cutting force and the critical speed is 
6000rpm under nonlinear cutting force at 1.0df . The critical 
speed is 5900rpm under linear cutting force and the critical

5. For both linear and nonlinear system, under nonlinear 
cutting force, the critical speeds of system and maximum 
dynamic responses of tool tip at any depth-of-cut and feed per 
tooth are larger than those under linear cutting force. 
6. In the chatter stability lobes, the results show that the 
intervals between critical speeds increase gradually in the 
chatter stability lobes and the difference between the reciprocal 
of successive critical speeds is a constant, which is influenced 
by natural frequency and number of flutes. The critical speeds 
are clearly different for linear and nonlinear system, and the 
axial depths of cut for stability of nonlinear system are low. 
By using numerical simulation, the critical speeds of system 
and maximum dynamic responses of tool tip can be determined 
to avoid the chatter of ball end milling under linear and 
nonlinear cutting forces for linear and nonlinear rotor systems. 
This work provides useful information on the dimensional 
accuracy of workpiece that will greatly affect the precision of 
surface finish.

ABSTRACT 
The nonlinear dynamic behaviors of rotor-bearing system 
for ball end milling are studied in this paper. The rotor system is 
supported by bearings with nonlinear spring effects. The 
nonlinear cutting force can be calculated by using the Tlusty 
proposed 3/4 rule for chip thickness. The effects of design 
parameters on system dynamic behaviors including critical 
speeds and stability under the dynamic cutting forces are 
numerically investigated in the time domain. For linear system 
case or the nonlinear system with small depth-of-cut or feed per 
tooth under linear cutting force, the results show that the critical 
speeds of system are proportional to the corresponding system 
natural frequencies, but inversely to the cycle number of tool 
vibration multiplying by the number of flutes during the cutting 
time from one flute to another. With large depth-of-cut or feed 
per tooth, the differences of the critical speeds become larger 
between linear and nonlinear rotor systems and so are the 
dynamic responses at critical speeds milling. The critical speed 
under nonlinear cutting force milling is found to be always 
higher than that under linear cutting force. Furthermore, the 
chatter stability lobes are studied for various cutting conditions. 
The intervals between critical speeds increase gradually, and the 
axial depths of cut of nonlinear system for stability are lower 
than those of linear system. 
1 INRTODUCTION 
In recent years, rapid progress has been made in the milling 
techniques with high material removal rates as well as fairly 
uniform machined surfaces. The requirements for shapes of 
products are strict, and the manufactured free-form surface 
products are produced in vast quantities. The responses of tool 
tip in ball end milling are the major topics in the surface 
processing. As a result, the technique of ball end milling process 
is studied frequently. Therefore, research of the dynamic 
responses of tool tip with linear and nonlinear cutting forces in 
linear and nonlinear rotor system could have significant 
economic impacts. 
Linear system is usually considered when the responses of 
tool tip are small under the light cutting forces. However, the 
effect of nonlinear system would appear in a bigger way, and so 
is the resonance. Furthermore, some researchers have devoted to 
establish the dynamic linear cutting forces model and the 
responses of linear rotor system but the dynamic behaviors of 
nonlinear rotor system in the ball end milling with nonlinear 
cutting force are rarely discussed. 
In early research, Martellotti [1] assumed that the tool radius is 
larger than feed per flute in milling process. A mathematical 
relationship was proposed between the feed and the chip width, 
which was cited widely by many scholars. Yucessan and Altintas 
[2,3] assumed that the friction and pressure loads on the rake 
face were proportional to the uncut chip thickness area, and 
modeled a mechanics of cutting with ball ended helical cutters 
to experimentally verify the model that accurately predicted the 
cutting forces in three Cartesian direction. Budak et al. [4] 
presented an experimentally verified model allowing 
transformation of orthogonal cutting parameters to oblique 
milling edge segments, and the cutting parameters of a titanium 
alloy were determined. Lee and Altintas [5] extended the model 
of Budak et al. [4] for the ball end mill and took into account of 
the tool geometric parameters. The helical flutes are divided into 
small differential oblique cutting edge segments which 
accurately predict the cutting forces under the assumption that 
the chip flow angle equals to the local helix angle. Abrari et al. 
[6] presented a dynamic force model and conducted a stability 
analysis for ball end milling. The dynamic deflections are 
determined by measured transfer function using a lumped 
parameter model for the tool/spindle with a two-degree of * Professor

The cutting coefficients tcK , rcK  and acK  provided by Budak 
et al. [4], are employed and summarized in Appendix B. 
2.2 Nonlinear Dynamic Cutting Force: 
The nonlinear cutting forces can be calculated in accordance 
with the experimentally verified 4/3  rule ([11] and [12]). The 
elemental tangential, radial, and axial nonlinear dynamic cutting 
forces tFd , rFd , aFd  acting on the cutter are given by

There are four cases in accordance with rotor system 
parameters and cutting forces. Case I (CSLF) involves constant 
system parameters and linear cutting forces; Case II (NSLF) 
involves system with nonlinear spring effects and linear cutting 
forces; Case III (CSNF) involves constant system parameters 
and nonlinear cutting forces, and Case IV (NSNF) involves 
system with nonlinear spring effects and nonlinear cutting 
forces. 
In the rotor system with nonlinear spring effects, it is assumed 
2/xx k  and 2/yy k . The limit cycle without excited 
forces is plotted as shown in Fig. 2. The equilibrium points are 
found to be )0,0(),( yx
 
and )2,2(),( mmmmyx   in which 
)0,0(),( yx  is stable and )2,2(),( mmmmyx   is unstable. 
Fig. 2 shows that the solid line converges toward a focal point, 
for any initial conditions given inside the solid zone. The 
corresponding responses of tool tip for nonlinear system can be 
determined. The dot lines diverge and the dynamic response of 
tool tip tends to infinity.

Figure 3. Responses of tool tip at 1a and 2.0df  for 
tool R3 in Case I. 
The dynamic responses of tool radius 3 mm  in Case I are 
shown in Fig. 3 for various spindle speeds, 808.5rpm, 4050rpm, 
  
11 
 
speed is 5950rpm under nonlinear cutting force at 2.0df . 
The critical speed and maximum dynamic response of tool 
under nonlinear cutting force milling is higher than those under 
linear cutting force. But the critical speeds of system are 
reduced with increasing df   for linear cutting force and 
nonlinear cutting force. This is because the system stiffness is 
softened with increasing responses of tool tip in rotor system 
with nonlinear spring effect for both linear and nonlinear cutting 
force.

spindle speed and df  
for Case I (CSLF) and Case III 
(CSNF) with constant system parameters.  
 
Figure 8. The maximum displacement of tool tip at various 
spindle speed and df  
for Case II (NSLF) and Case IV 
(NSNF) with nonlinear spring effect 
At 1.0df , 
the critical speeds are almost the same for both 
Case I (CSLF) in Fig. 7 and Case II (NSLF) in Fig. 8, but the 
critical speed (6000rpm) of Case IV (NSNF) in Fig. 8 is less 
than that (6064rpm) of Case III (CSNF) in Fig. 7. The former is 
because the difference in system stiffness is small for Case I and 
for Case II under small feed per tooth. The latter is because the 
response of tool tip is more enough to reduce system stiffness 
under nonlinear cutting force with nonlinear spring effect than 
those with constant system parameters. 
Fig. 9 shows the chatter stability lobes of Case I and Case II 
at 2.0df . In this study, the chatter is defined as the dynamic 
response of tool tip exceeding an expected value. The intervals 
between critical speeds increase gradually in the chatter stability 
lobes and the difference between the reciprocal of successive 
critical speeds is a constant, namely )60/( nf fN . It is found that 
all the critical speeds are different for Case I and Case II and the 
axial depths of stability of Case II are low. It proves that the 
system stiffness is softened with increasing responses of tool tip 
with nonlinear spring effects at all critical speeds.

5 CONCLUSION 
The dynamic behaviors of linear system and nonlinear system 
are numerically investigated for various depth-of-cut and feed 
per tooth. The results are summarized as follows: 
1. The critical speed of system is directly proportional to 
natural frequency and inversely proportional to the number of 
flutes ( fN ) multiplied by the vibration cycle numbers of tool 
during the cutting time from one flute to another ( km =1, 2, 3…). 
If km  is very large, the critical speed will not be excited. 
2. The critical speeds obtained from numerical simulation 
are well compared to the experimental results obtained by 
Altintas and Lee under same cutting conditions. 
3. With constant rotor system parameters, the effects of 
depth-of-cut and feed per tooth on the critical speeds for linear 
and nonlinear cutting force milling are not significant as found 
by numerical simulation analysis. 
4. In nonlinear rotor system, the critical speeds of system are 
approximately equal to the linear system case with small 
depth-of-cut or feed per tooth under linear cutting force. With 
large depth-of-cut or feed per tooth, the critical speeds will be 
reduced and the maximum dynamic response of tool tip at 
critical speeds milling are significantly different from those of 
the linear rotor system.
