Abstract 48 
In this study, after the extraction of non polar lipid fraction (NPLF) from soybean oil 49 
deodorizer distillate (SODD), the remaining lipids adsorbed on the silica were extracted with ethyl 50 
acetate for 3 h, to recover silica gel. The recovered silica gel was then heated at 150oC for 1 h. The 51 
regenerated silica gel was proved to be free of the residual lipids and ethyl acetate. By employing 52 
regenerated silica gel, it was possible to separate most squalene and fatty acid steryl esters (FASEs) 53 
in the NPLF and free phytosterols in the polar lipid fraction (PLF). However, the performance of 54 
regenerated silica on the separation of free fatty acids (FFAs), acylglycerols, and tocopherols, was 55 
poorer than that of fresh silica gel. 56

INTRODUCTION 59 
Silica gel is a granular, vitreous, and highly porous form of silica made synthetically from the 60 
reaction between sodium silicate and sulfuric acid. It was in existence as early as the 1640s as a 61 
scientific curiosity, and was patented by Walter A. Patrick at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 62 
Maryland in 1919 (1).  63 
Silica has many applications, it can be used as desiccant in various areas such as food, air 64 
dehumidification and compressed air system (2), as cat litter (3), as stationary phase in 65 
chromatographic separation (4), as adsorbent in adsorption technology (5), and as solid support in 66 
catalytic industries (6,7). 67

Regeneration of Silica Gel  107 
Silica gel with residual lipids adsorbed on it was then packed into an extraction thimble. The 108 
lipids were extracted with different kind of solvents (ethyl acetate, or acetone), which was heated. 109 
After predetermined time, the extraction process was stopped; the flask that contained the desired 110 
extract was removed and replaced immediately by another flask of fresh solvent so that the total 111 
amount of solvent remained the same as in the beginning of the run. After removing the solvent, 112 
each fraction was analyzed by TLC and high-temperature gas chromatography (HTGC). The first 113 
fraction, which was designated as the polar lipid fraction (PLF), was obtained by extracting with 114 
solvent for 3 h. The residual lipids were not detected in the next fraction, which was obtained after 115 
extracting with solvent for another 4 h.  116 
The recovered silica gel was treated by thermal swing at temperatures of 150oC for 1, 4, or 8 117 
h to remove the residual solvent. As the result, the treated silica gel was named as regenerated 118 
silica gel and was reused for extracting NPLF from SODD.  119 
TLC Analysis 120 
Individual components in each fraction were identified by using authentic standards as 121 
described by Gunawan et al. (11). Spots on each plate were visualized by exposing the 122 
chromatogram to iodine vapor, and by spraying with specific reagents, such as a fresh solution of 123 
ferric chloride, and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (16). 124 
HT-GC Analysis 125 
The qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed on a Shimadzu GC-17A (Kyoto, 126 
Japan) gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector as described by Gunawan et 127 
al. (12). Separations were carried out on a DB-5HT (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane nonpolar 128 
column (15 m × 0.32 mm i.d.; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).  The temperatures of the 129 
injector and the detector were both set at 370oC.  The temperature of the column was started at 130 
80oC, increased to 365oC at rate of 15oC/min, and maintained at 365oC for 8 min.  The split ratio 131 
was 1:50 using nitrogen as carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/s at 80oC.   132 
Analysis by Fourier Transform - Infra Red (FT-IR) 133 
Characterization of silica gel was performed in an FT-IR spectrometer (Digilab Excalibur FTS 134 
3500GX, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). FTIR spectra were collected from 4000 to 375 cm− 1 with 135 
resolution of 0.25 cm− 1, co-adding 128 scans to increase signal to noise ratio. The instrument was 136 
calibrated before measurements using a potassium bromide alone as background.  137 
Nitrogen Adsorption–Desorption Isotherm Analysis 138 
 BET-AUTOSORB-1 (Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL, USA) was used to 139 
characterize silica gel. The volume–pressure data can be reduced by the AUTOSORB-1 software 140 
into BET surface area, pore size and surface area distributions, micro-pore volume and surface 141 
area using an extensive set of built-in data reduction procedures. The specific surface area was 142 
determined based on BET (17).  143

silanol groups. Therefore, dehydration by heating was employed to remove residual water in 171 
silica.  172 
A lower heating temperature is favorable because of energy efficiency. The heating time was 173 
1 h. IR and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analyses were employed to investigate the nature of 174 
silica surface.  175 
Figure 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of the silica during heating. At 400oC, the dehydrated silica 176 
was a little brownish. This indicates that structure of the silica may have been changed. Moreover, 177 
IR study shows that bands at 3200 – 3400, 1650, and 900 cm-1 disappeared, which correspond to 178 
the elimination of O-H of silanol groups and adsorbed water, water molecules, and the Si-OH of 179 
silanol groups, respectively. For heating at temperatures less than 400oC, the IR spectra show that 180 
there is no significantly difference on the nature of the silica.  These results agree with previous 181 
observation on the thermal dehydration of silica gel (2). The author reported that up to 50% of the 182 
internal water and hydroxyl groups of silica gel were removed at 400 – 425oC, and the surface is 183 
also largely dehydrated to the siloxane condition at 1000oC.  184

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis was used to examine the physical 188 
properties of the silica. As shown in Table 1, both surface area and pore volume are highly 189 
dependent on heating temperature. The surface area and total pore volume decrease with 190 
increasing heating temperature.  At 150oC, the surface area and total pore size were significantly 191

After removing residual lipids, thermal swing process was then employed to remove residual 226 
solvent in the silica. The silica was heated in an oven at 150oC for 1, 4, or 8 h. IR analysis was 227 
employed to check whether ethyl acetate is completely removed from the regenerated silica gel 228 
surface. Ethyl acetate is characterized by the presence of bands at 1742 and 1240 cm-1 due to C=O 229 
and C-C-O stretch, respectively (19). These unique bands can not be found in the IR spectra of the 230 
regenerated silica gel among all heating time studied.  231 
The compositions of NPLF obtained from SODD by using regenerated silica gel are shown in 232 
Table 3. As the heating time is increased from 1 to 8 h, the separation performance of tocopherols, 233 
free phytosterols, FFAs, and acylglycerols are not significantly different, while the recovery of 234 
squalene is lower. At a heating time of 1 h, the contents and recoveries of squalene and FASEs 235 
were not significantly different (p < 0.05) while the recoveries and contents of more polar 236 
compounds, such as tocopherols, FFAs, and acylglycerols, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) by 237 
using regenerated silica gel than that obtained by using fresh silica gel.  Compared to the results 238 
obtained by using fresh silica gel, the recoveries of tocopherols, free phytosterols, FFAs, and 239 
acylglycerols by using regenerated silica gel at heating time of 1 h increase from 7.50% to 14.41%, 240 
1.51% to 4.60%, 21.74% to 49.71%, and 3.79% to 17.73%, respectively. In summary, the results 241 
show that the performance of regenerated silica on the separation of polar compounds, such as 242 
tocopherols, FFAs, and acylglycerols, was poorer than that of fresh silica gel.   243

regenerating silica gel from the modified soxhlet extraction of SODD. The regenerated silica gel 267 
proved to be free of residual lipids and ethyl acetate. However, results show that the separation 268 
performance of regenerated silica on FFAs, acylglyecrols, and tocopherols was significantly 269 
poorer than that of fresh silica gel. Our study shows that by optimizing operation conditions, it is 270 
possible to use the regenerated silica gel and achieve the same degree of separation as that 271 
obtained by fresh silica gel.  272
