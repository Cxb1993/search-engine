ABSTRACT
In this proposal, the improvements on the luminance intensity and the electron emission uniformity of
the field-emission lighting were investigated; in the meantime, the white-light phosphor was synthesized by
solid-state reaction for the preparation of white-light flat-panel field-emission lighting. It was found that the
Zn/ZnOx vapor concentration, the dominant growth plane of the nanostructure, and the chemically activity of
dopants had strong effects on the morphology and emission ability of ZnO nanostructures. The diameters of
the ZnO nanostructures were increased and the morphologies of nanoneedles were transformed into
leaves-like nanostructure when the graphite temperature was increased. The optimal field emission property of
the ZnO nanostructure was achieved when they were grown at 900°C for 10 min under N2/O2 flow ratio of 7:4.
The turn-on field for field emission was 0.34 V/μm, the curent density at an electric field of 7.59 V/μm was 
0.24 mA/cm2, and the CIE coordinates were x = 0.35, y = 0.37, it was a near white light. The improvements
on the luminance intensity, color purity, and emission uniformity of electrons of the field-emission lighting
will be keeping studied after this proposal.
INTRODUCTION
Flat-panel field emission lighting makes use of cold-cathode emission, and presents many advantages,
such as lighter weight, wider viewing angle and better image quality [1]. The structure of FED contains field
emission tips and phosphor screen. Field emission phenomenon first received attention in 1961 when
Shoulder proposed the first vacuum microelectronics device which was subsequently developed by Spindt and
co-workers [2-4]. Many different shapes of emission tips have been investigated in terms of the feasibility of
reducing the operating voltage and fulfilling the requirements of a flat-panel display. All tip shapes have their
own characteristics and unexpected performances. Nowadays, the tips with nanostructures have been attracted
much attention.
For nanostructured tips, the unique and fascinating properties of ZnO nanostructures, particularly their
electronic and optical properties, have recently gained prominence because of their potential applications in
transparent electronic devices [5], flat-panel displays [6], and electrochemical and toxic-gas sensors [7-9].
ZnO nanostructures can be synthesized by various methods, such as pulsed laser deposition [10], metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition [11], sputtering [12], and oxidation [13]. Among these growth techniques, the
4Results and Discussion
During the synthesis, graphite reduced ZnO into Zn metal by the processes ZnO + C→ Zn + CO, 2ZnO
+ C→ 2Zn + CO2, and ZnO + CO→ Zn + CO2. At the same time, the oxidation processes Zn + CO2→ ZnO
+ CO, Zn + 0.5xO2 → ZnOx, and 2C + 1.5O2 → CO + CO2 also occurred.17) At the growth temperature of
1000oC, Zn and Zn suboxides should be in their vapor phase.18,19) The Ag nanograins forming small solid
islands on the Si surface obstructed the flow of Zn and ZnOx vapors. This promoted the absorption of
Zn/ZnOx on the surface of the Ag nanograins, the development of nucleation sizes, and self-catalyzation to
form ZnO nanoparticles. EDX analysis showed that the ZnO nanostructures consisted of only Zn and O [Fig.
1(a)]. The detected elements of Si and Ag were from the substrate and Ag film, respectively. No Ag
nanoparticle at the tip of each nanorod was observed, as shown in the TEM image of Fig. 1(b). However, the
deposition of Ag nanograins was crucial to the growth of ZnO nanostructures at the high temperature of
1000oC. This is because the Zn atoms, with a boiling point of 907oC,19) can remain on the substrate for only a
very short time when there are no special nucleation sites on the substrate, that is, Zn atoms are reevaporated
from the substrate without being oxidized, and nothing is grown on the bare Si substrate. Therefore, the
deposited Ag film acted as a catalyst, which enhanced the growth of ZnO nanostructures. An SEM image of
the as-deposited Ag film is shown in Fig. 1(c).
Figure 1. (a) EDX analysis and (b) TEM image of the ZnO nanorods. (c) SEM image of the as-deposited Ag
film.
Since the concentration of Zn vapor has a strong effect on the morphology of ZnO nanostructures, the
composition of the source powder is one of the key parameters in nanostructure growth. When the
concentration of ZnO was lower than that of graphite, such as for a weight ratio of ZnO/C = 3/7, the growth of
ZnO nanorods was slow, and the nanorods had a hexagonal nanobrick structure, as exhibited in Figs. 2(a) and
2(b). Figure 2(f) is an enlargement of the region of Fig. 2(b) in the green dotted circle. From Fig. 2(f), we can
see that the nanorod grew from the base of a nanobrick, and that when the growth time was prolonged, the
nanobrick became dispersed and a long nanorod was grown. The XRD pattern shows that the dominant
growth plane of ZnO nanorods was the (002) plane; hence, most of the nanorods grew perpendicularly to the
substrate. The growth rate of the ZnO nanorods increased when the weight ratio of ZnO/C was increased to 1,
which was attributed to the increased Zn and ZnOx vapor concentrations.
We found that the nanorods had a tapered stem with a hexagonal cross section and that a long nanowire
grew from the top of each nanorod [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)). Fig. 2(g) is an enlargement of the region of Fig. 2(d)
in the green dotted circle. It was also found that when a new nucleation site was formed on the nanorod, a
hexagonal-faceted nanobrick developed, and consequently, a branched nanorod grew. In addition, when the
supply of O2 gas was turned off after growth, the O2 that remained in the reactor chamber was gradually
exhausted and the vapor concentration decreased as time passed. In this situation, the local concentration of
Zn on the growth front may have been very high, which led to rapid growth in the longitudinal direction and
continued growth during the cooling period. This is why a thin and long nanowire grew from the top of each
nanorod, as shown in Fig. 2(d).
Moreover, when the weight ratio of ZnO/C was increased to 7/3, the high ZnO vapor concentration
enhanced the growth rate of the nanorods, and the branches disappeared. The hexagonal cross section of the
tapered nanorods with a screw-dislocation morphology was clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 2(e). Figure
2(h) is an enlargement of the region of Fig. 2(e) in the green dotted circle, showing the screw-dislocation
morphology of the nanorods. The nanorods were approximately 1μm indiameter and 10.6 μmin length.

6lattice constants of a = b = 3.24 Å and c = 5.21 Å. The (002) plane was the main growth plane of the ZnO:Ga
nanorods. No diffraction peaks corresponding to Ga-compound phases were observed.
In contrast to the ZnO and ZnO:In nanostructures, the ZnO:Ga nanostructures had a sea-urchin-like
morphology. Straight ZnO:Ga nanorods with a sharp end grew radially from the same root. An SEM image of
the ZnO:Ga nanorods is shown in Fig. 4(e). When the concentration of Ga2O3 was increased from 0.5 to 8
wt%, the diameter of the ZnO:Ga nanorods was decreased from 700 to 500 nm but their length was increased
from 3 to 7 μm.
Additionally, in contrast with the hexagonal prism ZnO nanorods, the ZnO:Ga nanorods in the
sea-urchin-like structure had a smooth hexagonal surface. The high-magnification SEM image shown in Fig.
4(f) indicated that the ZnO:Ga nanorods were grown with a screw-dislocation or stacked structure resulting
from the stress induced by Ga doping. The Zn ions ( 2ZnR = 0.074 nm) in the ZnO lattice can be substituted
by Ga ions ( 3GaR = 0.062 nm), which induces structural stress as well as extra electrons in the crystal,
thereby increasing the conductance of the nanorods; this is a desirable characteristic for nanorods used as field
emitters.

The growth mechanisms for the ZnO, ZnO:In, and ZnO:Ga nanostructures are schematically illustrated
in Fig. 5. For the synthesis of ZnO nanostructures, ZnO powder was first heated and reacted with graphite to
generate Zn vapor, which then reacted with oxygen to create ZnOx vapor. Zn and ZnOx adsorbed on the
surface of Ag grains and self-catalyzed to form ZnO nanoparticles. As the growth process proceeded,
nanobricks with a hexagonal structure then developed. When the concentration of ZnO was increased, the Zn

8Figure 6(a) shows the FE characteristics of the nanostructures. The FE characteristics of the ZnO
nanorods, ZnO:In nanoballs, and ZnO:Ga nanorods satisfied the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) relationship, with
field enhancement factors β of 1512, 1283, and 2379, respectively. The emission current density of the
ZnO:Ga nanorods was higher than those of the ZnO nanorods and ZnO:In nanoballs. The formation of the
nanoball structure does not appear to improve FE performance. The performance image and the CIE
coordinates of the white-light flat-panel field-emission lighting are shown in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c), respectively;
the CIE coordinates were x = 0.35, y = 0.37. The emission area of FED was 2×2 cm2.
In order to improve the luminescence intensity and emission uniformity of the white-light flat-panel
field-emission lighting, the emission tips of ZnO nanostructures were grown using a three-zone horizontal
furnace via vapor transport deposition process. After the deposition of Au-catalyst thin film, commercial Zn
powder and graphite powder (weight ratio = 1:1) were loaded into two alumina boats. The Au-catalyst
deposited substrate was placed just above the other alumina boat. Then, the powder sources and the substrate
were put into different heating zones of the tube furnace. Additionally, the graphite powder was placed in the
first zone, zinc powder was in the second heating zone, and the substrate was put into the third zone. The first
zone was the upstream region near to the gas inlet and the third zone was the downstream region far from the
gas inlet. In this experiment, nitrogen gas is used as the carrier gas and oxygen gas is the reactive gas.
Meanwhile, a constant nitrogen gas was flowed in the tube furnace. When the reaction started, the oxygen gas
was introduced into the furnace to react with zinc. The supply of oxygen gas was cut off after the reaction,
and the furnace was cooled down to room temperature.

(3000 X) for (a) 850, (b) 900, (c) 950, and (d) 1000oC. The high resolution and cross sectional views (10000
X) of nanostructures were shown in (e) and (f) for graphite temperature of 900oC.
First, the weight ratio of ZnO and graphite powder was fixed at 0.5:0.5, and the flow rates of N2 and O2
gases were set at 70 and 40 sccm, respectively. To study the effect of the temperature of graphite on the
growth of ZnO nanostructures, the temperatures of graphite were varied at 850–1000°C to synthesize ZnO
nanostructure on (100) Si substrate. The N2 gas and O2 gas were set at 70 and 30 sccm, respectively. The
temperature rising rate of the tube furnace was controlled at 40 °C/min and the growth time was 10 min.
Figure 7 shows the SEM photos for nanostructures grown on Si substrate; top view 3000 X for (a) 850, (b)
900, (c) 950, and (d) 1000 °C. When the temperature was 850°C, the ZnO nanostructures with morphologies
of narrow diameter and long length were observed because the ZnO nanostructures grown at relatively low
temperature are too long to stand straightly. When the first zone temperature increased, the reaction was also
increased and the ZnO nanostructures with wider diameter and shorter length were grown. Because of the
high temperature, the length of ZnO nanostructures was broken and the thickness of ZnO layer was increased.
However, the strongest reaction was occurred when the temperature of first zone was 1000°C, and the ZnO
nanostructure with the widest diameter and shortest length were grown, as show in Fig. 7(d). The high
resolution top view and cross sectional view 10000 X for 900°C are shown in Figs.7(e) and (f), respectively.

morphologies of nanoneedles were transformed into leaves-like nanostructure. The best emission property of
the ZnO nanostructure was achieved when they were grown at 900 °C. Additionally, the quantity of
nanoneedles was increased when the oxygen flow ratio was increased, whereas the diameter of nanoneedles
was decreased. Therefore, the field emission property of nanostructures was improved when they was grown
with increased oxygen flow ratio because high density of emitters and uniform nanoneedle arrays were grown
except that the oxygen flow ratio was 50 sccm. It is shown that when the needle-like nanostructures were
grown at optimal conditions, the turn-on electric field for field emission was 0.34 V/μm, the curent density at
an electric field of 7.59 V/μm was 0.24 mA/cm2 for ZnO nanostructures grown at 900°C for 10 minutes. In
this study, the emission uniformity of electrons was successfully achieved with a three-zone furnace by varied
the power source weight ratio, gas flow ratio, furnace heating rate, and synthesis temperature. A near
white-light flat-panel field-emission lighting was obtained when the white phosphor was adopted. The
improvements on the luminance intensity, color purity, and emission uniformity of electrons of the
field-emission lighting will be keeping studied.
