For the above reasons, we present a new sub-
sequence matching method under the dynamic time 
warping distance for data streams that are summa-
rized with an arbitrary-width histogram-based syn-
opsis structure. Each histogram contains a value and 
a timestamp indicating the end of this histogram as 
shown in Fig. 1(a). Given a query sequence Q with 
length M that summarized with m histograms, we 
want to continuously report subsequences of stream 
with distances to Q not greater than the threshold ǫ. 
We propose the Weighted Dynamic Time Warping 
(WDTW) algorithm that derives these matching 
subsequences. In order not to overestimate the 
warping distance, which could happen when one 
histogram of a stream synopsis matches multiple 
histograms of the other one, we have designed a 
method to lower the overestimated distance. The 
WDTW algorithm is shown to have O(m) complex-
ity in both time and space at the coming of each his-
togram of the stream. After processing n histograms, 
the total time complexity of our method is O(mn), 
where m << M and n << N for synopsis streams. 
To evaluate the WDTW algorithm, we conduct 
two experiments using a real dataset of time series. 
For comparisons, we implemented two other subse-
quence matching methods, referred to as Synop-
sis-DTW and MicroCell-DTW. The experimental 
results show that, when compared with Micro-
Cell-DTW, our method and Synopsis-DTWhave far 
low computational time costs. However, our method 
has only a little trade-off in accuracy, which is not 
true for Synopsis-DTW. 
 
2. The Proposed Method -  
2.1 Problem Definition 
Given a data stream of length N, an online 
stream is summarized as a sequence of histograms X 
= {x1, x2, .., xn}, each of which has a height xvi and 
an endpoint xti as shown in Fig. 1(a). We can denote 
a stream synopsis as X = {hxv1, xt1i , ..., hxvn, xtni}. 
X[ts : te] is defined as a synopsis subsequence which 
starts from time ts and finishes at te, where both ts 
and te have to be endpoints of histograms of X. For 
ease of exposition, we denote a synopsis subse-
quence as X[[i] : [j]] to mean that it starts from the ith 
to the jth histograms of X. Given the notations, we 
now define the subsequence matching problem. 
Definition 1 (Synopsis Subsequence Matching). 
Given an online running stream synopsis X, a query 
synopsis subsequence Q, and a threshold ε, the goal 
of synopsis subsequence matching is to locate all the 
subsequences X[ts : te] that satisfy Dtw(X[ts : te],Q) ≤ 
ε 
 
2.2 WDTW: A Weighted Algorithm for Dynamic 
Time Warping 
To solve the above issue, we propose Weighted 
Dynamic Time Warping (WDTW) method. When 
the distance between the stream synopsis X = {x1, 
4 
 
major insight is that the consecutive histograms that 
match the same histogram xi can be combined. In 
other words, the consecutive cells (i, s) to (i, j), 
where s < j, will be considered as a cell combination, 
where the sub-optimal warping path goes from the 
upmostleftmost micro cell of (i, s) to the bottom-
most-rightmost micro cell of (i, j). 
 
Definition 2 (The Adjustable Distance in the Vertical 
Direction).  
For the warping path passes from the cell (i, s) to the 
cell (i, j), where s is the smallest index of these con-
secutive ones as a combination, the value Ev(i, j) is 
defined to represent the adjustable distance of cell (i, 
j) in the vertical direction as follows. 
 
 
Lemma 1. The total distance of the sub-path, in a cell 
combination from (i, s) to (i, j), of any warping path 
that contains it is: ∑jk=s (di,k × lqk) + Ev(i, j). 
 
Lemma 2. The accumulated distance Dl(i, j), where 
the path comes from the cell (i, j−1), can be obtained 
with following equation in O(1) time.  
Dl(i, j) = D(i, j−1) − Ev(i, j−1) + di,j × lqj + Ev(i, j) (3) 
 
Based on Lemma 2, the information required to cal-
culate Dl(i, j) is only 
stored in cell (i, j) and (i, j−1). Since the computa-
tion time of El(i, j) and El(i, j−1) is constant, D(i, j) 
is obtained in constant time. We give an example of 
this case. In Fig. 1(b), Ev(3, 3) = min{d3,2, d3,3}×(lx3 
−lq2 −lq3) = 1×(3−2) = 1, Dl(3, 3) = D(3, 2)−Ev(3, 
2)+d3,3×lq3+ Ev (3, 3) = 6−3+4×2+1 = 12. 
 
Case 3: Minimum Distance Path from the Up Cell 
In this case, the warping path passes through 
cell (i−1, j) as Fig.2(c) shows. Since this case is sim-
ilar to case 2 despite the consecutive cells are in a 
column, Du(i, j) can also be derived in constant time. 
In Fig. 1(b), Eh(3, 3) = 0, Du(3,3) = D(2, 3)−Eh(2, 
3)+d3,3 ×lx3 +Eh(3, 3) = 24−0+1×4+0 = 28. After 
deriving the distance values of the three cases, the 
minimum accumulated distance can be obtained. 
Continuing the previous example, D(3, 3) = 
min{Dd(3, 3), Dl(3, 3), Du(3, 3)} = min{22, 12, 28} 
= 12. 
We now describe how WDTW identifies 
matching subsequences. For each synopsis histo-
gram xi arriving at time ti, WDTW computes the ith 
row of the accumulated distance matrix D(i, j) where 
j = 1, 2, ...,m. Then, the warping distance of the most 
similar subsequence, X[ts : ti], to Q is Dtw(X[ts : 
ti],Q) = D(i,m). To get the start time ts, each cell (i, j) 
keeps the start time index where the warping dis-
tance comes from in the matrix S(i, j). Therefore, 
when constructing the warping path, the start and 
end time of the most similar subsequence are kept in 
the last cell (i,m) of this path. For example, in Fig. 
1(b), ts = t2. Hence, X[t2 : t3] is reported at t3 if 
Dtw(X[t2 : t3],Q) ≤ ε. 
Note that as we compute D(i, j), S(i, j) is also 
obtained. Since the computation cost of each D(i, j) 
and S(i, j) is O(1), the computation time of m histo-
grams is O(m). Also, only the information of 
cell(i−1, j−1),(i, j −1), and (i − 1, j) is used. There-
fore, WDTW only needs to keep the latest two rows 
of cells, i.e., O(2 × m) = O(m) in space. 
 
3 Performance Evaluation 
3.1 Experiment Setup and Performance Metrics 
The real datasets are downloaded from the 
UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Archive 
[10]. We choose time series in the posture dataset. 
The first pattern in each series was used as the query 
patterns with length M = 1024, while the rest part of 
the series as data streams with length N = 32768. 
The synopsis histograms in the following experi-
ments were built by Haar wavelet decomposition 
with varied synopsis rate [8], which is defined as a  
6 
 
ports all the matching subsequences. The experi-
mental results show that when compared with Mi-
croCell-DTW and Synopsis-DTW, WDTW has a 
low computation cost to meet the time and space 
constraints of streams, with a little trade-off in ac-
curacy.
