一、中文摘要 
 
本計畫為申請延續 97 年度執行計畫之第二
年研究計畫。主要在發展一同時具備光動力療法
與活體組織氧濃度量測之多功能奈米粒子。利用
激發能量之不同，使鍵結相同光驅動分子之單一
奈米粒子，產生不同之光反應機構，以具備光動
力療法與活體組織氧影像量測的能力；這種設
計，即是所謂「同位診治」（theragnostics），同
時包含治療（therapeutics）與診斷（diagnostics）
功能的醫療研發。 
本 計 畫 將 以 中 孔 洞 奈 米 矽 球 （ MSN: 
Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle）做為藥物傳輸母
體，鍵結鈀紫質（Pd-porphyrins）於矽球之（一）
中孔洞（nanochannel）中，或（二）矽球骨架
（framework）中。鈀紫質吸收光能量後，放出的
磷光會被環境中的氧焠冷，在高能量時，大部分
的氧被能量轉移激發成為單一氧態（ singlet 
oxygen），可作為具備殺死癌細胞能力之第二類
光動力療法試劑；相對應的，以低能量激發時（低
於高能量之 10-4~10-5），所產生之單一氧態濃度
低，無明顯之細胞毒性，但鈀紫質之磷光生命期
因氧焠冷而產生之變化，卻可依 Stern-Volmer 
Relationship，計算出有效碰撞範圍內之氧濃度。
同一鈀紫質/奈米矽球在不同之光能量下，即可作
為光動力療法（治療）或組織氧濃度量測（診斷）
兩種不同的功能試劑。而使用中孔洞奈米矽球的
原因，一方面是因為其具有非常高的內生表面積
（約 1000 m2/g）及規律之孔洞大小（直徑約 2.7 
nm），可供光驅動分子（如鈀紫質）專一鍵結，
另一方面，則是奈米矽球會經由 endocytosis 進入
細胞，可於細胞內，發揮光動力療法之最大效能。 
本計畫將以乳癌細胞（MDA-MB-231）及其
衍生之乳癌模式為標的，藉由發展此多功能之奈
米矽球，建立光動力療法於腫瘤之治療應用下，
腫瘤組織含氧量與第二類光動力療法療效之間的
關係，而此資訊之建立，將作為光動力療法於腫
瘤治療療效評估上不可或缺的環節之一。

Abstract 
 
Nanoparticle-assisted drug delivery has been 
emerging as an active research area in recent years. 
The in vivo biodistribution of nanoparticle and its 
following mechanisms of biodegradation and/or 
excretion determine the feasibility and applicability 
of such a nano-delivery platform in the practical 
clinical translation. In this work we report the 
synthesis of the highly positive charge, near-infrared 
fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) 
that demonstrate rapid hepatobiliary excretion, for 
use as traceable drug delivery platforms of high 
capacity. MSNs were incorporated with 
near-infrared fluorescent dye indocyanine green 
(ICG) via covalent or ionic bonding, to derive 
comparable constructs of significantly different net 
surface charge. In vivo fluorescence imaging and 
subsequent inductively coupled plasma-mass 
spectroscopy of harvested tissues, urine, and feces 
revealed markedly different uptake and elimination 
behaviors between the two conjugations; with more 
highly charged moieties (+34.4 mV at pH 7.4) being 
quickly excreted from the liver into the 
gastrointestinal tract, while less charged moieties 
(-17.6 mV at pH 7.4) remained sequestered within 
the liver. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
charge-dependent adsorption of serum proteins 
greatly facilitates the hepatobiliary excretion of 
silica nanoparticles, and that nanoparticle residence 
time in vivo can be regulated by manipulation of 
surface charge.

larger than 80 nm to be reported.  Previous in vivo 
imaging studies by our group, with the same 
fluorescent dye ionically conjugated to the same 
nanoparticle, reveal markedly different uptake and 
elimination patterns.
19
  Differences in the uptake 
and excretion of covalently-labeled MSNs from that 
of ionically-labeled MSNs are thus attributed to 
differences in surface charge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1.  Tracking of fluorescently labeled MSNs in 
vivo.  Five minutes following their tail-vein injection, 
most MSNs appear localized within the left and 
medial lobes of the liver.  After one hour, significant 
numbers of MSNs have already begun to undergo 
hepatobiliary excretion and have migrated 
towards/into the biliary duct. 
 
For these investigations we elected to use 
MCM-41 mesoporous silica.  With its intrinsically 
large surface area (~1000 m
2
/g), large pore volume 
(~1.0 cm
3
/g), inherent chemical stability, and 
highly-ordered hexagonal pore structure and 
adjustable pore size (1.5-30 nm), MCM-41 
mesoporous silica has found application in a variety 
of settings that include catalysis,
20-22
 separation,
23
 
drug delivery,
24-28
 and controlled drug release
29
.  
Earlier studies have shown it to be remarkably 
biocompatible and especially well suited to the 
efficient and protective transport of lipid-insoluble 
molecules across cell/organelle membranes.
30-32
  
We recently exploited these attributes of MCM-41 
to synthesize extraordinarily bright, near-infrared, 
contrast agents that retained over 95% of their 
available ligand binding sites for subsequent drug 
conjugation and biological targeting.
26
  
Near-infrared fluorophores were used for these 
studies as, at wavelengths between 650nm and 
900nm, both mammalian tissue and MSN exhibit 
only modest absorption of photons; thereby enabling 
greater photon penetration.  In our previously 
reported work,
26
 by ionically tiling the enormous 
surface areas of trimethylammonium-incorporated 
MSNs (MSN-TA) with the dye ICG, we achieved 
fluorophore loadings nearly 3 orders of magnitude 
greater than possible for aqueous suspensions, due 
to the MSNs’ steric inhibition of fluorophore 
aggregation and self-quenching, as well as it 
shielding of ICG from metabolic reduction and 
photo/thermal degradation.  In vivo optical imaging 
of the MSN-TA-ICG biodistribution in mouse and 
rat demonstrated rapid (minutes) and significant 
uptake of MSNs by liver; a finding confirmed ex 
vivo by inductively couple plasma-mass 
spectroscopy (ICP-MS) of silicon content, with liver 
accounting for slightly more than 35% of silicon 
uptake 6 hours post-injection – 4 times higher than 
the next highest-retention organ, the kidney.  TEM 
imaging of frozen tissue cross-sections, 3 hours 
post-injection, showed the sequestered MSNs to be 
largely concentrated within the intracellular vesicles 
of Kupffer cells.  In the current study we sought to 
determine what role, if any, an MSN’s surface 
charge played in its biodistribution, clearance from 
circulation, and excretion via comparing MSNs with 
surfaces modified for covalently-conjugated 
fluorophores to those with surfaces modified for 
ionically-conjugated fluorphores. 
 
三、結果與討論 
 
2.1. Materials.  
Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), cetyltrimethylamm- 
onium bromide (CTAB), methanol, ammonium 
hydroxide (30%), and 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxy- 
silane (APTS) were purchased from Acros Organics.  
N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammoniu
m chloride (50%, in methanol), indocyanine green 
(ICG), and pyridine were obtained from Sigma- 
Aldrich Chemical Co.  Cy5.5 NHS ester was 
secured from GE Healthcare Life Sciences.  
Ringer’s solution, with an ionic strength comparable 
to that of human plasma (NaCl: 8.60 mg, KCl: 0.3 
mg, CaCl2: 0.33 mg, for every 1 ml of H2O), was 
purchased from Henry Schein Inc.  
 
2.2 Preparation of MSN-NH2 samples.   
CTAB (0.58 g) was dissolved in NH4OH (0.51 
M, 300 ml) at 40°C, to which dilute TEOS (0.2 M in 
5.0 ml of ethanol) was added.  After vigorous 
stirring for 5 h, APTS (5.0 ml) and TEOS (1.0 M in 
5.0 ml of ethanol) were added, with vigorous stirring 
for another 1 h. The resulting solution was then aged 
at 40°C for 24 h.  Samples were collected by 
repeated centrifuging for 20 min at 12,000 rpm, 
 6 
dislocation, approximately 3 h after whole-body 
imaging.  Major organs were then immediately 
harvested intact, imaged for fluorescence using the 
in vivo imaging system, and frozen at -80 
o
C to 
await silicon distribution studies. 
2.8 Mass Spectroscopy of Tissues and 
Excrement.   
Silicon in various organs was measured using 
ICP-AES (Jarrell-Ash, ICAP 9000).  Sample 
preparation for ICP-AES was by dissolution of each 
organ in HNO3 (1 ml), HCl (3 ml), and HF (1 ml).  
Tissue solutions were then diluted in dH2O (100 ml) 
and heated at 120
o
C for 2 days.  Data presented in 
this work were obtained from averaging three 
control animals (Ringer’s-only injection) and four 
experimental animals (MSN-NH2-ICG or 
MSN-NH2-Cy5.5). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization of 
MSN-NH2-ICG  
  As illustrated in Fig. 2, secondary amine 
labeling of MSN were prepared via the sol-gel 
processes we previously used (see Methods), but 
without co-condensation of TA-silane with 
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), since the positively 
charge TA groups were no longer needed for 
fluorophore conjugation.
26
 TEM imaging of 
MSN-NH2 samples (Fig. 3a) showed hexagonal 
shape and uniform size, with a mean particle 
diameter of 50-100 nm.  
 
Fig. 2.  Sol-gel secondary amine labeling of and 
fluorophore conjugation to MSN surfaces. Adsorption 
of fluorophore within the hexagonal nanochannels of 
the resulting MSN-NH2 was performed in methanol 
solutions, to preclude fluorophore aggregation at 
high loading densities. 
 
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and 
pore size distribution of MSN-NH2 (Fig. 3b, c) 
revealed high surface area (432 m
2
/gm), uniform 
pore diameter (2.3 nm), and large accessible pore 
volume (0.38 cm
3
/gm).  Adsorption of ICG or 
Cy5.5 within the hexagonal nanochannels of the 
resulting MSN-NH2 was performed in methanol 
solutions, to preclude fluorophore aggregation at 
high loading densities.  Measurements were also 
made of the fluorescence spectra of MSN-NH2-ICG 
(Fig. 3e) in a physiological buffer (Ringers solution) 
of neutral pH, 20 mM HCl and 20 mM NaOH – to 
validate the adsorption of ICG and Cy5.5 onto the 
MSN and the stability of its fluorescence over a 
wide range of pH.  Spectra of MSN-NH2-ICG in 
HCl and Ringers solution showed similar high levels 
of fluorescence, but with emission maxima 
blue-shifted (relative to free ICG in H2O) from 830 
nm to 785 nm, while stronger fluorescence was 
observed for MSN-NH2-ICG in NaOH, with 
maximal emission less blue-shifted at 805 nm.  
Centrifuging these samples and examining their 
respective supernatants revealed significant leaching 
of ICG from MSN-NH2-ICG in NaOH (Fig. 3f);

images of MSN-NH2 showing typical hexagonal

signal emanating from the liver.  Interestingly, in 
addition to the nude mice, the similar migration 
pattern of MSN-NH2-ICG was also observed in the 
Male Sprague Dawley rats (weight ca. 250 g) (Fig. 
5).  It implicates that the hepatobiliary transport of 
MSN-NH2-ICG from circulation into GI tract is 
particle- rather than animal-dependent. 
 
 
Fig. 4. Hepatobiliary transport of MSN-NH2-ICG from 
circulation into GI tract (left) with control animal for 
comparison (right).  Within 10 min of injection nearly 
all of the MSN has been sequestered by the liver.  
After 60 min a significant percentage of MSN have 
already begun to enter the GI tract – an observation 
confirmed by subsequent ex vivo fluorescence 
imaging and ICP-MS of harvested tissues. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Hepatobiliary dynamic transport of 
MSN-NH2-ICG from circulation into GI tract in an 
anesthetized rat following i.v. injection.  Within 10 
min of injection nearly all of the MSN-NH2-ICG has 
been sequestered by the liver.  After 30 min a 
substantial percentage of MSN-NH2-ICG has already 
begun to migrate into the GI tract.  
 
Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs harvested on 
0 DPI correlated well with in vivo fluorescence 
imaging of the same animal done minutes earlier; 
with significant accumulation of MSNs in the 
duodenum/jejunum, modest amounts remaining in 
the liver, and a small background signal in stomach 
(Fig. 6a and 6b).  In vivo and ex vivo imaging of 
mice and organs on subsequent DPIs revealed very 
little if any MSN retention by the liver or lower 
gastrointestinal tract.  Fluorescence imaging of 
urine and feces, however, demonstrated most MSN 
entering hepatobiliary transport to be excreted in 
feces within 24 hours of nanoparticle injection, with 
no detectable renal excretion whatsoever (Fig. 6c).  
Fluorescence imaging of harvested tissues and 
excrement of mice injected with MSN-NH2-Cy5.5 
revealed no differences in MSN distribution or 
elimination from that of mice injected with 
MSN-NH2-ICG (Fig. 7). 
 
 
Fig. 6. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of excrement 
and organs harvested from mice were shown in 
Fig.6.; (a) the control animal and (b) the treated 
mouse, ~3 h following tail-vein injection of 16 mg/kg 
MSN-NH2-ICG.  While similar levels (i.e., dietary 
background) are seen in the two stomachs, 
significantly more MSN is apparent in the liver and 
intestine of the nanoparticle-treated mouse; a finding 
consistent with the fluorescent imaging of the same 
two animals’ urine and feces (c). 
 
3.4 Quantification of Silica Excretion Using 
ICP-MS 
To verify the fluorescence observed during 
optical imaging was indeed that of intact 
MSN-NH2-ICG and not simply that of 
MSN-dissociated ICG, we evaluated harvested 
tissues and excrement for their silica content using 
ICP-MS.  ICP-MS measurements showed 
significant uptake of silica by the liver and 
gastrointestinal tract immediately following 
injection of MSNs (0 DPI), with rapid elimination 
from those organs over the next 3 days (Fig. 8b) – 
 10 
 
Fig. 9. Representative TEM images of 70 nm thick 
liver-sections harvested from anesthetized mice (a) 
10 min following i.v. injection of 16 mg/kg 
MSN-NH2-ICG (2 um scale-bar) and (b) 3 days 
following i.v. injection of 16 mg/kg MSN-NH2-ICG 
(500 nm scale-bar).  Although statistically limited by 
the small areas sampled, several MSNs are readily 
apparent in the cell cytoplasm (white arrows, left) 
shortly after probe administration while few could be 
found in any of the sections made 3 or more days 
later, suggesting relatively efficacious excretion from 
the liver.

會議： 2009 NanoSmat: 4th International Conference on Surfaces Coatings and 
Nanostructured Materials/2009第四屆表陎處理與奈米結構材料國際會議 
時間： 九十八年十月十九日至九十八年十月二十二日 
地點： The Crowne Plaza Hotel, Rome, Italy 
 
內容： 本次參加會議為 2009 第四屆表陎處理與奈米結構材料國際會議（4th 
International Conference on Surfaces Coatings and Nanostructured Materials）。過去
數屆的會議，皆著重在奈米結構材料的製成，特性鑑定，以及工業應用。今年，
在奈米材料於生物醫學應用日趨重要，相關研究領域急速發展蓬勃的現況下，特
別加重了 Biotechnology and Nanomedicine Session 的份量，敦請來自 University of 
South Florida, USA 的 Prof. Don Haynie 來主持奈米醫學的議程。Prof. Haynie 是
近年來應用 Polypeptide Multilayer Nanofilms 於生物醫學相關研究的重要 leader。 
 此次，我們的團隊在大會發表兩項中孔洞奈米矽球（mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles）相關的生物醫學應用研發的成果。這些工作主要由本院醫學工程
研究組及奈米醫學研究中心的合作團隊共同完成。其中，tri-functionalization of 
mesoporous silica nanoparticles for comprehensive cancer therapy 是第一篇完整的
應用到單一奈米中孔洞奈米矽球分子內部三個不同結構區域，各修飾不同功能模
組，以達到 imaging/targeting/therapy 三合一效能的 cancer therapeutic nanoplatform
的報導。相關的成果已投稿於奈米科技領域的重要國際期刊審校中。 
另外，大部分的奈米粒子，包含中孔洞奈米矽球，在作為藥物傳輸的載具過
程，常會陎臨被 late endosome or lysosome 包覆隔離的問題，必須透過奈米粒子
的 endosome escape 的能力，才能將藥物釋放到 cytosol 中，這項障礙大幅度降低
奈米粒子的可利用性及藥物的 bioavailability。為解決這個問題，我們設計了
pH-sensitive 的 linker，將抗癌藥物 doxorubicin 攜接在中孔洞奈米矽球之高表陎
積的奈米孔道中，利用在 late endosome or lysosome 中的酸性 pH 環境，啟動
doxorubicin 的釋放。這項新穎的設計，受到與會材料工程研究人員相當大的興趣
與討論。而這項研究成果，刻正在撰寫整理，準備投稿國際期刊中。 
 這次的會議，藉由議程的安排，讓材料工程，包含 Solar Cells, Energy 
Materials，跟 Micro/Nano Fabrication，以及 Surface Science and Technology 的研
究領域，在延伸到 Biotechnology and Nanomedicine 的應用上，發展出各種相輔
相成的想像空間。並且藉由對相互領域陌生好奇的摸索與探討，希望能跳脫傳統
的相似領域合作模式，建立 Frontier 的研究方向。
