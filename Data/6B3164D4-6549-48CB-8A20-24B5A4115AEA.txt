1. Introduction
Drilled shafts are frequently used as the foundations for modern high-rise buildings,
bridges, electrical transmission line structures, and so on, to support the superstructure
loading. Side resistance is an important source of drilled shaft capacity under axial
loading, especially when the shaft is under the condition of longer or uplift loading.
Research on this subject has progressed well during the past five decades. Based on
soil type and loading condition, the analysis methods for side resistance are of two
types: drained or effective stress analysis and undrained or total stress analysis. These
analysis methods can be further briefly specified into the alpha (α), beta (β), and
lambda (λ) methods. Table 1 lists the analysis equations and their related factors for
each method. These analytical models were developed mainly for pure cohesive
undrained or cohesionless drained soils, instead of interlayer soils.
Theα method is a total stress analysis, a conventional undrained analysis for the side
resistance of drilled shaft foundations. The design side resistance is related to the
average soil undrained shear strength (su) by an empirical coefficient denoted asα, the
adhesion factor. The original α(Tomlinson 1957) was based on empirical correlations
with the mean su over the foundation depth, using primarily driven pile data. The
research from Stas and Kulhawy (1984) showed that the α method is meaningful for
drilled shafts. Furthermore, subsequent research (Chen and Kulhawy 1994, 2003) has
improved the correlation for drilled shafts using more consistent undrained shear
strength measurements and definitions of failure load.
Except for the parameter of undrained shear strength, further research (e.g., Randolph
and Murphy 1985; Semple and Rigden 1986; Kulhawy and Jackson 1989) on driven
piles has demonstrated thatα is more complexly related to other influence parameters
such as the mean effective overburden stress ( vm ), the overconsolidation ratio (OCR),
and the effective stress friction angle (). Goh et al. (2005) carried out parametric
studies using the trained neural network model and suggested that the vm directly or
indirectly influences α for driled shafts.They further proposed the tentative
correlation of αwith vm and the undrained strength ratio [(USR) = su/ vm ].
The β method is a representative effective stress analysis which considers the
frictional resistance for the soil-shaft interface. The design side resistance is a function
of the horizontal effective stress ( ho ), effective stress friction angle (δ)for the
soil-shaft interface, and shaft geometry. Kulhawy et al. (1983) examined the available
load test data and showed that the stress factor (K/Ko) is dependent on the
construction method and its influence on the in-situ stress. They also suggested that
field data should reflect real situations and the analyses results should be
representative for subsequent application in practice.
Tables 2 and 3 show the interpreted parameters and analysis results for the drained
and undrained load test, respectively. The details are given elsewhere (Chang 2007).
These load tests have been conducted in various soils around the world and at
different times. The values of α, β, and λwere back-calculated using Eqs. 1, 2 and 3
from the field load test results. For the load test data, the L2 method (Hirany and
Kulhawy 1988, 2002) was adopted to define the capacity in both uplift and
compression. In addition, the updated interrelationships among interpretation criteria
(Fang 2007; Chang 2007) were used to infer the required L2 if the load test data were
insufficient or were terminated prematurely. For convenience, Table 4 lists the ranges
of foundation geometry and the interpreted capacities from the database, along with
the data standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (COV), which is the
standard deviation divided by the mean. As can be seen, the ranges are broad, but the
drained and undrained populations are roughly comparable.
3. Evaluation of Side Resistance
3.1α Method
a.α - su correlations
The value of α can be back-calculated from the field load test results using Eq. 1 and
can be simplified as follows:
α = Qs(L2) / [πB D su] (4)
where Qs(L2) = interpreted side resistance using the L2 method and su = mean
undrained shear strength over depth D. To standardize the α-su relationship, the
consolidated-isotropically undrained triaxial compression (CIUC) test was selected as
the appropriate reference test, considering that the CIUC is the most common, good
quality, reference test. The su values from all other tests were converted to
“equivalent” su(CIUC) values using the procedures given elsewhere (Kulhawy and
Mayne 1990; Chen and Kulhawy 1993, 1994). Fig. 1 presents the result of αCIUC
versus su(CIUC) correlation. Likewise, su is normalized by pa, which is one
atmospheric stress in the same unit as su.
The suggested equation is αCIUC = 0.30 + 0.17/[su(CIUC)/pa] with n = 148, r2 = 0.66,
and SD = 0.09. By comparing Fig. 1 with previous results (Kulhawy and Chen 2003),
the regression line and statistical data (the coefficient of determination, r2) are found
and vm , can be regarded as an auxiliary analysis method to improve the conventional
α-su correlation in the case of small su. Based on the data distribution of Fig. 2, the
scopes of (1) vm < 200 kN/m
2 for USR < 3 and (2) vm < 100 kN/m
2 for USR > 3
can more precisely select the required α valueas the data in these scopes are tighter
and more uniformly distributed along the regression line.
3.2β Method
a. drained loading
The approximate beta values (βp) can be predicted from Eq. 2 and given as:
βp = Ko (K/Ko) tan(．δ/) (5)
Meanwhile, the measured β (βm) can be computed from the equation as follows:
βm = Qs(L2) / [πB D vm ] (6)
where K = the operative horizontal stress coefficient, which depends on the original
in-situ coefficient of horizontal soil stress (Ko), and the other terms having been
defined previously. With assumptions of βm =βp and δ/ = 1 for drilled shafts, the
stress factor K/Ko can be back-calculated from Eq. 5. Table 7 shows the statistical
results of K/Ko for the different construction methods with drained case, undrained
case, and drained and undrained cases together. For the drained case, the mean values
of K/Ko are 0.73, 0.97, and 1.03 for slurry, casing, and dry construction, respectively.
The results are obviously larger than in the previous studies by Kulhawy et al. (1983),
which showed K/Ko = 2/3 for slurry, K/Ko = 1 for dry construction, and intermediate
values between these ranges for casing construction under water. The results also
differ with the results by Chen and Kulhawy (1994, 2002), which showed that the
stress factor is essentially 1 for properly constructed shafts by whatever means.
Fig. 3 shows the comparison of measured and predicted drained βbased on the
suggested K/Ko values of this study. Table 8 summarizes the statistical data using the
suggested values of K/Ko from different research works. It can be seen that the
measured and predicted results in this study are more consistent than in the previous
studies. With the mean βm/βp = 1.13 for Kulhawy et al., it is clear that the K/Ko was
underestimated. Although Chen and Kulhawy increased the K/Ko to 1 and somehow
improved the prediction, the updated suggestion for K/Ko of this study based on
construction methods can further improve the prediction method. Using the suggested
K/Ko values in this study, the mean drained βm/βp is 1.03 and βm = 1.01 βp for
λ= Qs(L2) / [πB D ( vm + 2 su)] (7)
in which all terms have been defined previously. Fig. 7 shows the results of λversus
shaft depth. It can be seen that the range of data points is very wide (0.05-0.35) for
short shafts (D < 30 m) with mean λ = 0.19, n = 131, SD = 0.07, and COV = 0.36. The
λ value is convergent to a consistent value when the shaft depth is greater than 30 m
or so. For these available data points, the statistical results are mean λ = 0.11,n = 17,
SD = 0.02, and COV = 0.20. According to these results, it is obvious that the COV for
long shafts is much less than for short shafts, and that a more reliable predicted side
capacity can be expected for long shafts. However, the prediction of side resistance of
λ method is generally less reliable than theα or β method.
4. Evaluation of Side Resistance for Interlayer Soils
As can be seen, total stress analysis (αmethod) and effective stress analysis (βmethod)
are the most suitable analytical models for cohesive and cohesionless soil,
respectively. The results of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are used for the evaluation of shafts in
the interlayer of cohesive and cohesionless soils. There is a total of two prediction
methods for interlayer soils: one is the hybrid of α and β analysis methods (denoted
α-β analysis) and the other completely uses β method (denoted β analysis). For α-β 
analysis, the cohesive soils use α-su/ vm - vm correlation on the condition of vm <
200 kN/m2 for cases where USR < 3 or vm < 100 kN/m
2 for cases where USR > 3,
while the updated α-su correlation is used for the rest of the conditions. The
cohesionless soils use Eq. 5 and the recommendations of Section 3.2a. Meanwhile, the
β analysis of interlayer soilsuses Eq. 5 and the recommendations of Sections 3.2a and
3.2b for cohesionless and cohesive soils, respectively
Table 9 lists the statistical results, and Figs. 8 and 9 present the results of Qsm/Qsp
(measured side resistance/predicted side resistance) versus shaft depth forα-β analysis
and β analysis, respectively. By comparing the statistical data, they demonstrate that
the α-β analysis is superior to the β analysisand that the Qsm is closer to Qsp in α-β 
analysis. In the comparison of Qsm/Qsp versus shaft depth, both analyses present wide
range results for short shafts. On average, the predicted side resistance is about 50%
underestimated for short shafts, but the ratio of Qsm/Qsp is close to 1.0 when shaft
length is longer than 20 m. However, the α-β analysis shows a tighter and more
uniform distributionthan the β analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the recent decades, the urban train system has been widely used as a main transportation solution within a city
and its region in several countries across the world. However, the ground vibrations induced by the train system may
cause disturbance and discomfort to the occupants. Experience shows that the building vibration induced by the train
system can reach levels that cause human annoyance, possible damage to old and historical buildings, and interruption
of sensitive instrumentation and processes.  Therefore, the ground vibration problems have drawn engineer’s highly 
interest in recent years. The engineers have to study the vibration characteristics so as to find the solution schemes of
vibration mitigation.
In this paper, the vibration characteristics induced by the train system and some related vibration assessments are
introduced. The evaluation methods from different available representative assessments are reviewed briefly, and
then a series of field vibration measurements of urban train systems were compared with these evaluation methods.
Several field measurement results are presented to show different vibration amplitudes for various structures and soil
types. For bridge structures, many factors are found to affect the train-induced ground vibrations. It is anticipated
that the different vibration characteristics of concrete structure from the steel structure. The paper will present the
main key points of these two different structures. In addition to the different bridge types, the various underground
geological conditions are encountered. Obviously, the different vibration characteristics will be obtained for the
different foundation conditions. The response of structure foundation located on both layered soil and rock will be
compared in the paper. The main vibration characteristics are focused on the frequency contents and vibration levels
from the results of the field measurements.
.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE EVALUATION METHODS
2.1 Vibration impact assessment of U.S.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (FTA 1995, FRA 1998) developed the manuals to provide guidance of
vibration impact assessment for rapid transit and high speed rail. For the case of high speed rail project, some
important factors for the vibration assessment are discussed in this section.
1. Screening Distances
The screening procedure uses Table 1 to determine whether the vibration-sensitive land uses are close enough for
the impact from ground-borne vibration. The screening distances were decided by the train speed, the frequency of
trains and the land used. More detailed analysis is required if any sensitive land uses are within the screening
distances.

5. Factors affecting vibration receiver
Vibration generally reduces in level as it propagates through a building with a 1- to 2-decibel attenuation per floor.
Resonances of the building structure, particularly the floors, will tend to counteract this attenuation and will cause some
amplification of the vibration.
2.2 Basic features of train-induced vibration in Japan
In Japan, the studies in the train-induced vibration are mainly for Shinkansen, the name of high speed rail in Japan.
Many factors are found to influence the ground vibration amplitude and spectrum induced by the train system. The
main features of the train induced vibrations for the Shinkansen rail system are briefly described in the section.
(Yoshioka, 2000).
1. Dependence on the characteristics of cars
The characteristics of cars related to ground vibration are car weight, car number, car length, wheel base and
bogie-centers distance, and train speed. The original axle load of Shinkansen was 16T, but for 300, 500, 700 series,
the axle loads have been remodelled to 11T to reduce the ground vibration. The overall vibration level of Shinkansen
ranges from 63~57dB, and the measured distance from the track is 12.5m. Figure 1 illustrates the 1/3-octave band
VL-z spectrum of Shinkansen vibration measured at 10m away from the track, which is averaged over 103 sites after
normalization of each overall value to 0 dB (Yoshioka, 2000). The site condition is : train speed 200km/hr, ballast
track, rigid-frame bridge and alluvial ground. The acceleration spectrum shows three visible peaks in 6.3, 16~20 and
40~50Hz, and the 16~20Hz are the most dominant peak. Yoshioka (2000) interprets these three peaks as the
periodicity of axle arrangement and speed of train.
f1=V/d1(distance of axles), f2 =Vtrain-speed/d2(distance of bogie-center), f3=Vtrain-speed/d3(car length)
The periodic effects of axle arrangement on different train speed decided the peak frequency of the train-induced
vibration spectrum.
The relations of train speed and vibration level are developed by the measured data. The equation is listed as
follows.
VL=10 n log10(v/v0) + VL0
Where v0 is a reference speed, VL0 is an average VL for the speed v0, and n is a coefficient to represent the
incremental rate of VL values to speeds. The n value ranges from 1.5 to 3.5, depending on the measured results of
different rail lines.
Figure 1. One-third octave band VL-z spectrum of Tokaido-Shinkansen-induced vibration (Yoshioka, 2000)
The typical result from the acceleration measurement in X-direction (the train moving direction) for MRT system is
shown in Figure 2.  For this case, it can be found that the train is consisted of 4 cars.  The eight wheels’ peaks are 
marked distinctly in the figure. The speed of the train can be determined from the passing time with the given length
of the train.
Figure 2. Time domain data of acceleration measured in the X-direction (Ni et al. 2002)
3.3 Presentation of measuring results
There are several ways, such as narrow band and octave band, etc., to present the vibration characteristics from time
domain measurement. The IOS 2631 recommends that, where many closely-spaced frequencies or broadband
(random) energy are involved, one-third octave band filters should be used to differentiate the effects of one frequency
range from another. In this paper, the one-third octave band velocity spectra were used to present the time domain
data. All the measurements are carried out using the one-third octave band analyzer with central frequency from 1 Hz
to 100 Hz. The ground vibration level is expressed in terms of its root-mean-square (RMS) velocity using the decibel
scale. The RMS velocity level in decibels is defined as:
VL (in dB) = 20 log10 (vm/vref)
In which vm = the measured velocity and vref = the referred velocity (where vref = 10
-6 in/sec in this study).
4. DATA BASE
There are five sites selected to measure the ground vibrations in accordance with the variation of railway systems,
soil deposits, and bridge types. The mass rapid transit (MRT) system (Ni et al. 2002) and ordinary railway (OR)
system are two major vibration sources in this study. The measurement for MRT system has only a unique train type,
car number and train speed, etc., while the measurement for OR system has different car numbers and speeds. The
details of different train types, including car, wheel and track information are listed in Table 2. In Table 2, the major
differences between OR1 and OR2 are car numbers. Furthermore OR1 was divided into two types based on their train
speed.
For the selection of structure type, material of superstructure, foundation type, and geological condition are the main
reference bases. For super-structure, prestressed concrete (PC) and steel, in general, are the major materials. The
spread footing, pile and caisson are commonly used as bridge foundations. Table 3 presents the detailed information
for these structure types of measurement. A total of six structure types were included in this vibration measurement.
It can be seen that these structure types are wide variety and representative.
Geological condition is also a very important concern on the site selection. The foundation bearing ground in
MRT system includes hard ground (rock formation) and soft grounds (soil layers). For the two measurement locations
foundation (8mx8m) was adopted since the subsurface of this site is interbedded with slightly weathered sandstone and
shale which is considered to be a good bearing layer.
The results measured at site 1 for the X, Y, and Z directions are shown in Figure 3. Ten curves are presented in
Figure 3, and five for train toward east direction (dash line) while another five for train toward west direction (solid
line). It can be seen that there are peak values at 4, 6.3, and 12.5 Hz in the X direction while there are peak values at
2.5, 3.15, 5, 6.3 and 12.5 Hz in the Y direction. However, there are peak values at 5, 6.3, 12.5, 16 and 25 Hz in the Z
direction. The largest velocity level is about 60 dB in X and Y direction and about 70 dB in Z direction.

Site 2
The site 2 is located at intersection of Tunhua south road and Hoping east road of Taipei. The prestressed concrete
(PC) l bridge is 40m-70m-37m. For the three-span continuous P.C. bridge, the span lengths are all 23 m. The
superstructure of the P.C. bridge is box girders with depth of 1.4 m. The superstructure of the steel bridge is also box
girders but with depths varied form 2.8 m to 2.0 m. For the sub-structures, the diameter of the piers for the longest
span (70 m) is 2.0 m, and the diameter of other piers is 1.6 m. The average height of the piers is 10 m. The shaft
foundation is adopted since the soil conditions are soft in this area. For the longer span of steel bridge, six piles are
connected to a reinforced concrete footing and four piles are used for other foundations. The diameters of piles were
designed as 0.8 m~1.2 m and the pile lengths are 33 m~37 m. The subsurface of soil deposits of this site is more
complicated than that of the site 1. The soil profile is mainly consists of soft clay (CL) with layer of fine sand (SP) or
gravel (GP) bedded. The SPT-N value of clay layer is less than 10 while the SPT-N value of gravel layer is greater
than 50. For the purpose of comparison, two ground vibration locations are simultaneously measured in this site as the
transit car passing. One is for steel bridge deck while the other is for concrete bridge.
The one-third octave bandwidth frequency responses of site 2 for the steel bridge deck and the concrete bridge deck
are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. As shown in the figures, the amplitude in the vertical (Z) direction is
greater than the other two directions for the case of steel bridge. However, for the concrete bridge the amplitude in the
vertical direction is less than the other two directions.
The result measured at the steel bridge shows that there are peak values at 3.15, 5, 6.3 and 40 Hz in the X direction
while there are peak values at 1.25, 1.6, 6.3, 12.5, and 25 Hz in the Y direction. However, there are peak values at 1.6,
2, 5, 6.3 and 10 Hz in the Z direction. The largest velocity level is about 58 dB in X direction, 60 dB in Y direction
and 73 dB in Z direction. The result measured at the concrete bridge shows that there are peak values at 1.6, 6.3, 25,
and 50 Hz in the X direction while there are peak values at 1.6, 8, 12.5, 16, 20 and 50 Hz in the Y direction. However,
there are peak values at 1.6, 6.3, and 25 Hz in the Z direction. The largest velocity level is about 75 dB in X, 78 dB in
Y direction and 73 dB in Z direction.
The site 4 is located at central Taiwan and near the Tai-An Station of Taiwan Railway System. The selected case
in this location is a simple pre-stressed concrete (P.C.) bridge with the span length of 25 m and between Tai-An Station
and tunnel. The superstructure of the bridge is P.C. with I shape. For sub-structures, the diameters of the pier are
changed from 2.5 m 5.0 m and the average heights of the piers are 18 m. The spread footing foundation (10m x 10m)
is adopted since the soil condition is a quite homogeneous gravel formation. The ground water table is around 7-8 m
below ground surface.
The one-third octave bandwidth frequency response of site 4 at 0 m distance (near the pier ) is shown in Figure 7 for
train with speeds 114 km/hr and 81 km/hr, respectively. All measurements for different distances show that the
amplitude in higher speed is larger than in lower speed. The dominant amplitude and frequency in Z direction are 83
dB/63 Hz, 60 dB/25 Hz, 50 dB/10-12.5 Hz, and 45dB/8Hz, for distances with 0 m, 25 m, 100 m, and 200 m to the track
center, respectively. For the comparison of three directions, the amplitude in Z-direction is larger than in X and Y
directions, however, the attenuation in Z direction is faster than in X and Y direction. For example , the amplitude in
Z direction is larger 7-8 dB than X and Y directions at 0 m and the amplitudes for three directions are almost same at
100 m and 200 m distances.

Figure 7. One-third octave bandwidth frequency response of Site 4 at different train speeds
Site 5
The Site 5 is located at Tseng Wen River of southern Taiwan (Shen, 2002). The selected case in this location is a
steel bridge with the span length of 19.2 m. The bridge is an open-deck and simple-supported type. For
sub-structures, the piers are two 1.1m x 1.1 m square type and the average heights of the piers are 7 m. The caisson
foundations are adopted since a soft clay layer is underlain by a deep bearing stratum (sandstone and mudstone). The
soil profile below ground surface 15-20 m is soft silty clay (CL) with the SPT-N value between 8 and 12. The caisson
foundation was designed as 6.8 m diameter with length of 6.8 m. The train speed for the measurement is 112 km/hr.
The one-third octave bandwidth frequency response of site 5 is shown in Figure 8 for different distances. Because
the site is located at soft soil and the stiffness of bridge is low, the amplitude near the pier (distance = 0 m) is exceed the
maximum acceleration of the sensors (> 7.07 m/sec2). When the vibration amplitude propagates to the distances of 25
m and 200 m, their amplitude and frequency in Zdirection are 69 dB/8-10 Hz and 63 dB/5-10 Hz, respectively.

Figure 8. One-third octave bandwidth frequency response of Site 5 at different distances
The frequency of maximum vibration level in hard ground and soft ground are also quite different. It can be found
from Table 3 that, in general, the maximum level is happened at high frequency (6.3-12.5 Hz for MRT system and 63
Hz for OR system) for hard ground, and soft ground is happen in low frequency (6.3 Hz for MRT system and 5-10 Hz
for OR system).
The attenuation of vibration level is also greatly affected by the geological condition. From Table 3, the maximum
vibration level becomes around 36-42 dB for OR1 while the OR2 still remains 59-64 dB. It is about 22-23 dB
difference. Therefore the attenuation of vibration in hard ground will be more obvious than in soft ground.
Factor of bridge type
For the purpose of comparison, the vibration level curves for the two different structures are shown in Figure 9. In
the figure, the result of solid line is measured at the concrete structure while the result of the dash line is measured at the
steel structure. It can be seen that the steel structure is effectively reduced the energy from X and Y directions as
comparing with that from Z direction.

Figure 9. Comparison of frequency response between steel and concrete structure
The train-supporting structural condition is also a major factor for the magnitude of ground vibration level. The
results of MRT system measurement show that the less vibration levels induced by train when using the steel structure
comparing with using the concrete structure (Site 2). It is very possibly induced by the factors of rigidity and concrete
volume of the structures. A comparison of bending rigidity and concrete volume of steel structure and concrete
structure is presented in Table 5. The steel bridge has much more bending rigidity than the case of concrete bridge.
The results indicated that the more bending rigidity and concrete volume of structure, the less of ground vibration level.

Evaluation of attenuation
All data shows that the ground vibration level attenuates with increasing distance. However, the attenuation is
different in various ground condition. The attenuation is more obvious in hard ground than in soft ground. In the
other words, the attenuation in high frequency is more obvious than in low frequency. Comparing the vibration levels
for X, Y, and Z directions from these data, the attenuation in Z-direction was more obvious with the increased distance.
