1 Introduction
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation results in beat-to-beat
changes in heart rate (HR). It has been reported in previous researches that
heart rate variability (HRV) analysis provides an insight into the mechanism
of ANS activity [1, 2]. In general, there are a number of existing methods
devised based on time-domain, frequency-domain, geometrical and nonlinear
techniques, respectively, for standard HRV analysis. Often, conventional
time or frequency domain methods for standard HRV analysis may suffer
from imperfect quality of RR data due to the presence of ectopic and missing
beats in the ECG signal [3]. Abnormal beats that do not originate in the
sinoatrial (SA) node occur even in healthy people [4] and would represent a
major source of distortion when performing HRV analysis in both the time
and frequency domain. There exist a number of algorithms for correcting
the RR signal, such as substituting an ectopic beat-caused RR value by the
avarage, median or linearly interpolated values of neighboring normal RR
intervals [4, 5, 6]. On the other hand, if the ectopics occur too frequently
it is possible simply to exclude the RR segments containing abnormal beats
from the HRV analysis [6, 7, 8].
It has been reported in literature that the Lorentz plot provides simple
visual assessment of HRV in a long-term ECG recording [9]. In such a plot, all
pairs of successive RR intervals are plotted as a scattering map in Cartesian
coordinates, thus permitting an easily-visible but reasonable evaluation of
global HRV even though the signal quality does not meet the requirement
for the use of time and frequecy domain methods. However, instead of precise
forms of analysis, the Lorentz plot based HRV assessment is limited by its
approximate nature and thus only allows a qualitative analysis of HRV. In
order to achieve a quantitative analysis, one possibility of more complex
analyses of the Lorentz plots can be attributed to the so-called nonlinear
approaches.
In the past decades, significant progress has been made in the analysis
and characterization of complex systems. This might be partly due to the
availability of numerical algorithms used for quantifying the level of chaos,
such as Kolmogorov entropy [10] or Lyapunov exponent [11, 12, 13], in com-
plex systems. In general, Lyapunov exponents estimate the amount of chaos
in a dynamical system by quantifying the exponential divergence of initially
close phase-space trajectories reconstructed through the experimental time

2 Methods
2.1 Trimmed Moving Average (TMA)
A “trimmed” moving averaging process can be defined as
y[n] = f tT{xn}, (1)
where xn = [x[n] x[n−1] · · · x[n−M +1]]
t is an M ×1 vector of input data
at time n (whereM defines the averaging interval), y[n] is the filter output, T
denotes the algebraic ordering transformation, and f = [f1 f2 · · · fM ]
t is an
M × 1 vector of weighting or filter coefficients. The ordering transformation
T is such that T{xn} is an algebraically ordered version of
[x[n] x[n− 1] · · · x[n−M + 1]]t
ranked from the smallest to the largest. Also, the M × 1 filter coefficients
are defined by setting
fk = 0, for k = 1, . . . , P (2)
and M − P + 1, . . . ,M ;
=
1
M − 2P
, otherwise.
For convenience, suppose the averaging intervalM is restricted to odd values.
These filter coefficients fk’s represent the application of a moving averaging
operation to the input data, but with the P largest and P smallest values
from the input sequence removed. It should be noted that while for P = 0 the
trimmed moving averaging filter functions like a moving averaging operation
to the input data, for P = M−1
2
it is simply reduced to a median filter.
That is, the trimmed moving averaging filter can be viewed as a compromise
between the moving averaging and the median filters [21, 22].
2.2 The Largest Lyapunov Exponent Estimation
Detecting the presence of chaos in a dynamical system can be achieved by
estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent. Consider two phase-space tra-
jectories with nearby initial conditions, the average divergence of both tra-
jectories will be growing at an exponential rate characterized by the largest
4
According to the definition of λ1 in (3), the divergence of the jth pair of
nearest neighbors can be approximated by
dj(i) ≈ Cje
λ1i∆T , j = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1, (8)
where dj(i) denotes the distance between the jth pair of nearest neighbors
after i discrete-time steps, ∆T is the sampling period of the time series, and
Cj is the initial separation. Compute a least-squares fit to the line defined
by
y(i) =
1
K∆T
K−1∑
j=0
ln dj(i). (9)
Consequently, the slope of the least-squares line gives the estimate of λ1.
2.3 Architecture of the Proposed Algorithm for HRV
Analysis
The proposed algorithm for HRV analysis is consisting of two steps: (1)
TMA-based frequency-selective filtering, and (2) largest Lyapunov exponent
calculations, as depicted in the schematic diagram given by Fig. 1. The
TMA-based frequency-selective filtering system is formed by a parallel com-
bination of an ideal allpass filtering and a TMA filtering. According to
Fig. 1, given an N -point input sequence x two N -point outputs y(l) and
y(h) are then determined by the TMA filtering output and by subtracting
the TMA filtering output from the original input x, respectively. That is,
suppose x = {x[n]}N−1n=0 , y
(l) = {y(l)[n]}N−1n=0 and y
(h) = {y(h)[n]}N−1n=0 , we have
y(l)[n] = f tT{xn}, (10)
y(h)[n] = x[n−
M − 1
2
]− f tT{xn}, (11)
where T{xn} and f have the same definitions as those addressed in (1) and
(2), respectively. According to the descriptions in Section 2.1, the TMA filter
indicated in Fig. 1 performs a moving averaging operation on the sorted M
windowed input samples (from the smallest to the largest) but with the
P largest and smallest values removed, permitting a nonlinearly lowpass
filtering and thus allowing the sub-system between x and y(l) to function
like a nonlinear lowpass filter (NLPF), whereas that between x and y(h) to
function like a nonlinear highpass filter (NHPF).
6
phase space plots corresponding to both complex systems are respectively
reconstructed through both time series by setting the reconstruction delay
D = 1 and embedding dimension m = 2. From visual assessments it is
found that the incorrect RR intervals resulting from aberrant beats lead to
clear outliers in phase space, particularly for the y(h) estimates. To obtain a
more accurate estimate of λ1, these phase space outliers should be excluded
from λ1 estimation. Thus, the algorithm used for calculating λ1 should be
modified.
Since an outlier that falls outside the major distribution of system states
may result in significantly large divergences between it and other phase space
vectors, to reduce the impact from the outliers in λ1 estimation we proposed
to retain the first ⌊αK⌋ sorted divergences for the subsequent averaging pro-
cess but exclude the remainings. For example, α = 0.95 implies there are
about 5% outliers expected to be seen in the original RR time series. The
estimate of λ1 is then obtained by finding the slope of the least-squares line
given by (9).
Consequently, it is revealed from the demonstrative example as shown
in Fig. 2 that the modifications on λ1 estimation proposed by our study
finally yielded estimates of λ
(l)
1 =1.3331 and λ
(h)
1 =3.2067. An evaluation of
the capability of λ

will be described in the subsequent section.
3 Performance Evaluation
In this section, a performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is pre-
sented. Seven healthy subjects were scheduled to undergo ECG measure-
ment. The subject exclusion criteria included: SA node dysfunction, abnor-
mal AV conduction, heart failure, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and
chronic obstructive lung disease. For each subject, two 10-minute ECG data
were collected on supine and sitting positions, respectively; the collected ECG
signals were sampled by the rate of 200 Hz. Initially, all the ECG signals were
preprocessed by bandpass filtering (2–20 Hz) to remove the baseline drifts
and motion artifacts. After applying an existing QRS detection method for
detecting the time locations of the R waves for each ECG signal, the corre-
sponding interbeat interval sequence (i.e., the RR data sequence) was then
obtained. Next, the RR sequence derived from each ECG signal was further
8
cedure. It is actually revealed from this table that the inequalities indicated
in (12) and (13) both hold for all the subjects in our study. In addition,
Figs. 3 and 4 also provide two demonstrative examples.
In order to compare/validate the results obtained from the proposed al-
gorithm with those obtained from the conventional spectral approaches an
autoregressive (AR) based spectral analysis of HRV was also performed on
the same database. The numerical results of AR-based spectral analysis are
tabulated in Table 3, and the validation outcomes of the spectral technique
is provided by Table 4. A comparison was made further between both the
outcomes as indicated by Tables 2 and 4, respectively. As a result, one
may see that the HRV assessments achieved by both methods were nearly
consistent to each other (except for subject no.7). In general, according to
the preliminary results of performance evaluation we may speculate that the
novel approach might possess good potentials to the development of inno-
vative indicators for HRV assessments. Also, it should be noted that the
results obtained were not critically dependent on the choices of α, indicating
a degree of robustness over a wide range of noise contamination in measured
RR data.
4 Discussion
According to the comparison made between Tables 2 and 4, one may see that
subject no.7 produced different results from the others. Inspections on the
original RR signals were further performed for this subject. Fig. 4 provides a
set of demonstrative plots for subject no.7. Obseving Fig. 4, we notice that
no matter on supine or sitting position, the RR time series measured from
subject no.7 were seriously contaminated by spurious spikes due to aberrant
beats. In fact, one possibility could be that spectral analysis of HRV for this
subject was severely limited by poor signal quality so the standard spectral
measures of HRV might not be able to correctly reflect the actual sympathetic
or vagal activities, even though a median filtering algorithm for correcting
the RR signal for this subject was applied beforehand.
On the other hand, although Fourier- or AR-based power spectral analysis
has been proved to give information of the entire spectrum of the important
HR rhythms or modes, these techniques are not very useful for identifying
complex patterns. For this existing problem, new approaches may have to
