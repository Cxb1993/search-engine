三、結果與討論 
   
1. 以三維的具PML的全向量有限元素波束傳播法數值模型分析含液晶之光子晶體光纖 
近來以液晶結合光子晶體光纖以形成可調式光纖或可調式光纖器件的研究已有一
些實驗的結果發表，包括加熱式調變[1], [2]，電式調變[3], [4]，以及全光式調變[5]，所
採用的光子晶體光纖有等效全反射導光的孔洞光纖，也有以光子能隙導光的光纖，而所
利用的物理機制有純粹液晶折射率的變化，也有液晶光軸的轉動，後者代表原有孔洞中
之空氣被各向異性材質所取代，理論上導波模態將變為很複雜，只是上述實驗性的論文
沒有很嚴謹的理論分析，因而我們針對相關複雜結構光子晶體光纖(包括液晶分子
directors 指向任意方向的較複雜的情況)進行較嚴謹的模態分析。 
我們先前已建立的採用複合邊界結點三角形元素的全向量有限元素法光波導模態
分析模型，波導材質可具有對角化的 permittivity tensor 與 permeability tensor，三角形元
素已推展為更具彈性的曲線性元素，應用於如光纖之具曲形材質介面的結構時，在波導
截面先做線性複合邊界結點三角形元素分割，然後將曲形材質介面鄰近的元素變形為曲
線性三角形元素，可增大程式的效率與精準度。當我們嘗試推展數值模型至任意各向異
性材質光波導，即 permittivity tensor 與 permeability tensor 為非對角化的情況，發現無
法得到一個容易求解的特徵值問題。我們因而尋求另外方式，建立具曲線性三角形元素
的三維全向量波束傳播法模型[6]，成功解得模態，且模型中加入完全匹配層(PML)吸收
邊界，得以計算傳播損耗。在本計畫中，我們分析如圖一(a)所示之 chalcogenide 玻璃中
空光子晶體光纖，chalcogenide 玻璃在 1.55 微米波長具 2.251 之高折射率，纖殼區為六
圈注入液晶(nematic liquid crystal)的空氣孔洞。中空纖芯部分，如圖一(b)所示，亦注入
液晶，晶格常數 a = 2.26 μm，而液晶的正常與異常折射率分別為 1.5292 與 1.7072。注
入液晶的三角形排列玻璃中孔洞示於圖二(a)，而圖二(b)定義θc 為液晶 c 軸與 z 軸的夾
角，φc為液晶 c 軸在 x-y 平面的投影與 x 軸的夾角。以三維全向量波束傳播法模型分析
不同θc與φc夾角之圖一(a)光子晶體光纖，結果請參 Appendix I (發表於 Optics Express 期
刊的論文[7])之 Fig. 9，模態場型示於 Fig. 10，纖殼區僅為四圈注入液晶的空氣孔洞結
構之結果則示於 Fig. 8。這些結果顯示我們可分析相關光纖的複數傳播常數，並獲得模
態傳播損耗，或稱 confinement loss。在[7]中，我們以此模態傳播損耗隨波長的變化來
檢驗相關能隙結構計算的正確性。 
2. 建立以有限元素法計算含液晶二維光子晶體能隙結構的數值模型 
計算光子晶體的能隙結構，通常最廣被採用的方法為平面波展開法，以有限元素法
計算能隙結構的文章較少見，以類似有限元素光波模態解法，我們可推導出 Ez與 Hz(垂
直於二維光子晶體平面)的 Helmholtz 方程式，分屬橫向磁場波與橫向電場波，計算區域
為單一晶包(unit cell)內，然後採用週期性邊界條件於同方向的邊界，得到所需的特徵值

Abstract: To effectively investigate the fundamental characteristics of
two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals (PCs) with arbitrary 3D material
anisotropy under the out-of-plane wave propagation, we establish a full-
vectorial finite element method based eigenvalue algorithm to perform
related analysis correctly. The band edge diagrams can be conveniently
constructed from the band structures of varied propagation constants
obtained from the algorithm, which is helpful for the analysis and design of
photonic band gap (PBG) fibers. Several PCs are analyzed to demonstrate
the correctness of this numerical model. Our analysis results for simple
PCs are checked with others’ ones using different methods, including the
transfer matrix method, the finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD)
method, and the plane-wave expansion method. And the validity of those
for the most complex PC with arbitrary 3D anisotropy is supported by
related liquid-crystal-filled PBG fiber mode analysis, which demonstrates
the dependence of transmission properties on the PBGs, employing a
full-vectorial finite element beam propagation method (FE-BPM).

propagation characteristics of EM waves in the PC structures.
The wave propagation condition for 2D PCs can be definitely classified into the in-plane and
out-of-plane wave propagations. As implied by the name of the in-plane wave propagation, the
wave modes will simply propagate along the periodic plane under this condition. In order to
explore the characteristics of 2D PCs under the in-plane wave propagation, various kinds of
numerical methods, such as the plane-wave expansion (PWE) method [3], the finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) method [7], the finite element method (FEM) [8], the finite-difference
frequency-domain (FDFD) method [9], the pseudospectral method (PSM) [10], etc, have been
employed to carry out the band structure analysis of 2D PCs under this condition. In addition,
to comprehend the intrinsic influence of anisotropic materials on the PCs [11–13], some more
general models have been developed for the investigation of 2D anisotropic PCs, provided that
the wave modes can be decoupled into simple transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic
(TM) modes [14, 15]. Moreover, a full-vectorial FEM based eigenvalue algorithm has also been
proposed for the analysis of 2D PCs with arbitrary 3D anisotropy [16]. With these efforts, great
convenience and flexibility for the analysis and design of 2D PCs under the in-plane wave
propagation can be achieved.
For the out-of-plane wave propagation, the wave propagation direction is oblique to the peri-
odic plane of 2D PCs, and the propagation constant or the out-of-plane wave vector component
is no more zero. In such condition, the existing modes in the 2D PCs are no more simple TE
or TM modes but hybrid ones. Consequently, to investigate the important characteristics of 2D
PCs under the out-of-plane wave propagation, all the components of the electric or magnetic
fields should be taken into consideration simultaneously to obtain the band structures related
to non-zero propagation constants. There were already some models developed for this kind
of analysis [17, 18]. However, these previous models did not take the materials with arbitrary
anisotropy into account yet. Therefore, a more general numerical model which can correctly
perform the band structure analysis of varied propagation constants for 2D PCs, into which the
anisotropic materials may be intentionally introduced for the purpose of altering their wave-
guiding properties, is quite necessary.
In this paper, a full-vectorial FEM based eigenvalue algorithm for the band structure analysis
of 2D PCs, even composed of arbitrary 3D anisotropy, under the out-of-plane wave propagation
is accomplished. The numerical model of this full-vectorial FEM based eigenvalue algorithm is
presented in Section 2. In Section 3, this algorithm is actually employed to calculate the band
structures of varied propagation constants and construct the band edge diagrams, which are
useful for the design of PBG fibers [19], for some 2D isotropic and anisotropic PCs. For the
relatively simple PCs, i.e., isotropic or simple anisotropic ones, the band edge diagrams from
this algorithm are found to be consistent with others’ results using different methods. For the
most complex PC with arbitrary 3D anisotropy, the correctness of the band edge diagrams from
this algorithm is verified from the propagation property analysis of a PCF with its cladding
region composed of the corresponding PC by a full-vectorial finite element beam propagation
method (FE-BPM) [20]. It is believed that the proposed eigenvalue algorithm is valuable for
the analysis and design of PBG fibers, especially when arbitrary 3D anisotropy is involved. The
conclusion is summarized in Section 4.

where l denotes the contour or boundary enclosing the area, nˆ is its outward normal vector,
and ∑e extends over all different elements. Then the PBCs are imposed in this algorithm [14] to
eliminate the vector {ψ}. Consequently, the desired matrix eigenvalue equation in the proposed
full-vectorial algorithm for the band structure analysis of 2D anisotropic PCs with arbitrary
permittivity and permeability tensors under the out-of-plane wave propagation can be derived.
3. Numerical results
In the following, several PCs will be analyzed by the proposed algorithm. The complexity of
the considered PCs is increased gradually, and the correctness and capability of this algorithm
are verified clearly.
3.1. Isotropic PCs
The band structures of 2D PCs under the out-of-plane wave propagation can be obtained from
the proposed algorithm, and the band edge diagrams can be further constructed. To demonstrate
the procedure clearly, we start from a simple 2D isotropic PC, consisting of triangle-arranged
air holes in the silica with the refractive index n = 1.45, of which the unit cell is shown in Fig.
1(a). The first Brillouin zone (BZ) of the 2D PC with triangular lattice is shown in Fig. 1(b), in
which six sub-zones are marked. For isotropic PCs, considering all the possible directions of
the wave vector k in the sub-zone Γ-M-K, identical to the irreducible BZ (IBZ), is sufficient for
the construction of band structures. The band structure of this PC with the air filling fraction

Fig. 5. (a) The band edge diagram and (b) the band gap map of the 2D PC with triangle-
arranged LC-filled holes in the silica.
In the analysis of 2D anisotropic PCs under the out-of-plane propagation, the whole procedure
mentioned above can be systematically repeated to construct the desired band edge diagrams
of 2D anisotropic PCs, provided that the six sub-zones in the first BZ, as depicted in Fig. 1(b),
are taken into consideration for the construction of complete band structures [14].
The first 2D anisotropic PC analyzed here is composed of triangle-arranged liquid-crystal
(LC)-filled holes in the silica, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The components of the relative permittivity
tensor [εr] of the nematic LCs (5CB) [24] used in this structure are given as
εxx = n2o +(n
2
e −n2o)sin2 θc cos2 φc (26)
εxy = εyx = (n2e −n2o)sin2 θc sinφc cosφc (27)
εxz = εzx = (n2e −n2o)sinθc cosθc cosφc (28)
εyy = n2o +(n
2
e −n2o)sin2 θc sin2 φc (29)
εyz = εzy = (n2e −n2o)sinθc cosθc sinφc (30)
εzz = n2o +(n
2
e −n2o)cos2 θc (31)
where no = 1.5292 and ne = 1.7072 are, respectively, the ordinary and extraordinary refractive
indices of the nematic LCs, θc is the angle between the crystal c-axis and the z-axis, and φc
represents the angle between the projection of the crystal c-axis on the x-y plane and the x-
axis, as defined in Fig. 4(b). In this structure, the radius of the LC-filled holes is r = 0.25a,
and the angles, θc and φc, are, respectively, set to be 90◦ and 0◦, resulting in a diagonal relative
permittivity tensor. Figure 5(a) shows the band edge diagram of this 2D anisotropic PC. Though
the PBGs can not extend into the left side of the air line, some of them can extend into the left
side of the light line corresponding to ne f f = 1.45. Therefore, it is possible that a silica-based
solid-core PCF with its cladding region composed of this PC can be fabricated to guide the
EM waves in the core region by means of the PBG effect. The band edge diagram can be
transformed into the band gap map as shown in Fig. 5(b), in which the results of no = 1.522
and ne = 1.706 [25] are also plotted. It can be seen that, even for such complicated PBGs, our
results of no = 1.522 and ne = 1.706 are quite consistent with those from [25]. This agreement
absolutely guarantees that our algorithm can correctly construct the band edge diagrams for
anisotropic PCs with diagonal material tensors.
Next we consider another 2D anisotropic PC composed of triangle-arranged LC-filled holes
in the chalcogenide glass, a kind of high-index glass (n = 2.251 at 1.55-μm wavelength) which
is often used in the fabrication of PCFs when high refractive index is preferred [26]. Same

modes versus wavelength for this LC-core PCF of a = 2.26 μm with four rings of LC-filled
holes are, respectively, shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), in which the solid lines denote the PBG
boundaries derived from the band edge diagrams in Fig. 6, and different colors are used to
distinguish the results for different orientations of the LC molecules. Notice that the results for
θc = 90◦ and φc = 30◦ are not presented here because no mode guided in the core region is
found when the LC molecules rotate to this direction. From Fig. 8(a), it can be seen that the
effective index of the guided mode is highly dependent on the orientation of the LC molecules
as a result of filling the LCs into the core region. Furthermore, a strong support for the existence
of the PBGs can be observed in Fig. 8(b), from which we can see that the confinement loss is
relatively low around λ = 1.55 μm, and increases toward the vicinity of the PBG edges [27].
Also it is observed that a larger value of θc will result in a narrower PBG interval, and thus the

and 1.571 μm are, respectively, shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). It is seen that the field of the mode
at λ = 1.55 μm is localized in the core region better than that at λ = 1.571 μm, which directly
reflects the fact that the confinement loss at λ = 1.55 μm is smaller than that at λ = 1.571 μm,
as seen in Fig. 9(b). The counterpart of Fig. 9 for the LC-core PCF of a = 1.90 μm is shown
in Fig. 11. Now the PBGs shift to shorter wavelengths and minimum confinement loss occurs
around λ = 1.30 μm. Hence, it is quite apparent that the phenomena discussed above can be
successfully duplicated in other wavelength intervals by simply adjusting the lattice distance a.
Based on the above demonstration and discussion, we concretely show the capability of the
proposed full-vectorial algorithm for investigating the characteristics of 2D PCs with arbitrary
3D anisotropy. With this full-vectorial algorithm, we can more clearly understand the related
properties of 2D PCs before they are actually used to form the PCFs. Consequently, the related
analysis and design for PCFs can be more flexible and efficient.
4. Conclusion
We have successfully developed a full-vectorial FEM based eigenvalue algorithm for the char-
acteristic investigation of 2D PCs with arbitrary 3D anisotropy under the out-of-plane wave
propagation. The numerical model of this algorithm is presented clearly, and its validity is
carefully examined through the band edge diagram construction of several 2D isotropic and
anisotropic PCs. With the confirmation of these numerical examples, it is believed that impor-
tant characteristics of kinds of 2D PCs with different material combination and geometry defi-
nition can be conveniently and correctly realized by the proposed algorithm. Consequently, the
proposed full-vectorial eigenvalue algorithm can provide valuable guidelines for the analysis
and design of PBG fibers, especially when anisotropic materials such as LCs are intentionally
introduced into the PC structures.

Abstract: Plasmonic waveguide modes on triangle-shaped metal groove structures are analyzed using a 
full-vectorial imaginary-distance finite-element beam propagation method based on curvilinear hybrid 
edge/nodal elements with triangular shape. Both ideal grooves with infinite sidewalls and real guiding structures 
with truncated grooves are studied. Mode behaviors for different groove angles and at different wavelengths are 
investigated. Groove tips rounded with an arc radius are particularly compared with the ideal sharp grooves. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Applications based on the phenomena of surface 
plasmons (SPs), or surface plasma polaritons, which 
exist at an interface between a metal and a dielectric 
at optical frequencies with electromagnetic fields 
evanescently decaying away from the interface in 
both media [1], have attracted intensive research 
activities in different areas including nanophotonics 
and biomedical sensing.  SPs along a simple planar 
interface correspond to a two-dimensional (2-D) 
wave propagation problem. In real applications such 
as optical signal transmission in highly miniaturized 
integrated optical circuits, 3-D guiding structures 
with mode fields well confined in a small area in the 
transverse plane are desired. Such 3-D waveguides 
have recently been investigated experimentally and 
theoretically, including those with a groove on a 
metal surface for achieving deep-subwavelength 
waveguides [2]–[5]. Due to their highly localized 
field at the metal-dielectric interfaces and 
vector-mode characteristics, accurate calculation of 
complex modal propagation constants for the SP 
waveguides is more difficult compared to 
conventional optical waveguide problems. The 
method of line [6], the integral equation method [2], 
the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) [3], [4], 
[5], and the multiple multipole method [5] have been 
employed for studying 3-D SP waveguides. Recently, 
SPs on triangle-shaped metal wedges and grooves 
have been investigated based on the finite element 
method (FEM) [7], [8]. The FEM has the advantages 
of more properly treating material interface field 
continuity conditions through adaptive mesh 
arrangement, as compared to traditional finite 
difference schemes using rectangular grid meshes. 
We have established an imaginary-distance 
finite-element beam propagation method 
(ID-FE-BPM) for solving optical waveguide modes 
[9], [10], which is a suitable method for analyzing SP 
modes on various plasmonic waveguides. In this 
paper, we apply the analysis method to investigate 
the SP modes on triangle-shaped metal grooves [5], 
[8]. In [5] and [8], the triangular groove vertex tips 
were assumed to be rounded with an arc of a-few-nm 
radius. Here we examine the effect of different values 
of such arc radius, including the ideal sharp-groove 
case (zero arc radius). We are able to do so thanks to 
the hybrid edge-nodal elements employed in our 
method. Such examination of the effect of the tip 
roundness was conducted for the triangular wedge 
structures in [11]. In addition to the ideal grooves 
with infinite sidewalls, we also consider real 
waveguides with truncated grooves. 
 
2. THE FINITE ELEMENT MODE SOLVER 
The FEM based electromagnetic solution schemes 
have been very powerful techniques for waveguide 
mode analysis. Its flexible nonuniform mesh-size 
assignment is particularly useful for saving memory 
storage. Our full-vectorial FE-ID-BPM is 
incorporated with perfectly matched layer (PML) 
absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) for 
calculating the real and imaginary parts of the modal 
propagation constants. In the FE analysis, the 
waveguide cross-section is divided into curvilinear 
hybrid edge/nodal elements with triangular shape. 
Such elements are particularly useful for imposing 
the continuity of the tangential fields. Linear 
tangential and quadratic normal (LT/QN) basis 
functions are employed. The H-formulation is 
utilized. The use of the curvilinear hybrid elements 
makes it possible to calculate the six field 
components (that is, Ex, Ey, Ez, Hx, Hy, and Hz) from 
obtained eigenvectors, to efficiently adjust the mesh 
density to properly fitting the shape of the waveguide, 
and to derive eigenmodes without extracting spurious 
solutions. The flexibility of the element size also 
allows us to increase the mesh density in a specific 
area, resulting in a more accurate description of a 
local area without sharply increasing the 
computing time. With the slowly varying envelope 
aprroximation and the Fresnel approximation in

cases share the same tendency that the effective index 
goes higher when α gets smaller and it approaches to 
the effective index of the two-layer structure when α 
gets larger. At small angles, the effective index 
depends drastically upon the r value. As α or r 
decreases, the mode field is more localized near the 
vertex tip with more fraction of the field in the metal 
and the effective index increases, but the modal loss 
gets larger much rapidly as is seen in Fig. 5(b) which 
shows the modal loss in dB/mm as a function of α 
for the corresponding six cases in Fig. 5(a). The same 
trend shared by all six cases is that the loss is higher 
when α gets smaller and the loss at λ = 0.633 μm is 
larger than at λ = 1.55 μm. 
 
expected that the groove waveguide has infinite 
higher order modes, and the Nth-order mode has N 
local maximums with N – 1 nodes.  
 
4. THE REAL GROOVE WAVEGUIDES 
In real design, the ideal wedge/groove waveguide, 
which extends to infinity along the y-axis, is 
unachievable; instead, the real wedge/groove 
waveguide is a truncated one as shown in Fig. 7. 
There is a finite height h which would affect the 
waveguide performance. As delineated in Fig. 8, the 
truncated waveguide can be viewed as two wedges 
and one groove (for the truncated groove waveguide) 
or two grooves and one wedge (for the truncated 
wedge waveguide). The finite height h plays a role in 
determining whether the newly-introduced 
groove/wedge modes will influence the original 
wedge/groove mode. In fact, if h is large enough, the 
truncated-case results will be nearly the same as the 
ideal-case ones because the structure variation is far 
away from the major modal field area. 
The groove waveguide is multi-moded when α is 
small and the wavelength is short. Figure 6(a) and (b) 
demonstrates the second and the third order modes 
with α = 25○ and r = 10 nm at λ = 0.4 μm. The 
higher order modes have more extended field 
distributions and appear with nodes. The second 
order mode in Fig. 6(a) is seen to have one node 
between the two sets of local maximums, while the 
third order mode in Fig. 6(b) appears with two nodes 
punctuating the three sets of local maximums. They 
both have smaller effective indices and lower losses 
than the fundamental mode. Since the structure 
extends  to  infinity  along  the y-axis,  it can be

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A thin metallic stripe film on a homogenous dielectric, as shown in Fig. 2(a), can be generated by electron 
beam lithography, such as Au or Ag stripes mounted on glass substrate [10]. The excitation of the metal stripe 
mode has been achieved by attenuated total reflection (ATR) in the Kretschmann configuration [11]. Besides, 
the SPP bound mode on this structure have also been predicted [2] using the Method of Lines (MoL), and 
verified experimentally [12]. However, another kind of modes, the edge mode, supported by the stripe was not 
reported by the MoL study. Here, we present both modes calculated by the FE-ID-BPM method. The metal in 
the structure of Fig. 2(a) is Au with relative dielectric constant, ε= −26.1437 + 1.8497i at λ= 800 nm, and 
dielectric 1 is air with ε= 1.0, and dielectric 2 is silicon with ε= 1.46. Thanks to the symmetry with respect 
to the vertical direction, only the right half of the waveguide cross-section needs to be considered in the analysis 
with the assignment of the perfect-magnetic-conductor (PMC) boundary, as shown in Fig. 2(b) with the FE 
mesh.  
We investigated the characteristics of an edge waveguide with finite height, having the other edge extending 
to infinity in the x direction, and found that the SPP mode is strongly bounded on the edge, which we call the 
edge mode. If the distance between the two edges is finite, it becomes a stripe waveguide we concern in this 
study. Here, we discuss the SPP edge mode and the bound mode on the stripe waveguide. The edge mode is 
different from the bound mode in several aspects. For the mode profiles, shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d) as the 
z-direction power density profiles in the waveguide cross-section, we can easily distinguish the difference 
between these two modes. For the edge or corner mode shown in Fig. 2(c), the power is mainly guided by the 
stripe corner and secondarily by the edge. For the bound mode, the power flows over the metal/silica interface, 
as shown in Fig. 2(d). Besides, the bound mode has the limitation of the stripe width because it requires a wide 
enough stripe to fulfill the smallest momentum, kx, in the lateral direction [4]. We find the limitation width is 
about 1.4 μm. However, the edge mode is easier to exist without this width limitation.

between the edge and bound modes for the effective index neff is shown in Fig. 3(a). The effective index is larger

ABSTRACT 
  The leakage losses of guided modes on 
silicon-on-insulator photonic wire waveguides are 
analyzed using the full-vectorial finite element 
imaginary-distance beam propagation method. The 
influence of computational domain size on the 
determination of leakage losses are examined 
carefully in order to obtain accurate results in the 
analysis. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
  Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic wire 
waveguides are promising for achieving 
high-density integration of optical components on a 
chip and process compatibility with conventional 
silicon electronics [1]−[4]. The high refractive-index 
contrast between Si and SiO2 makes strong 
confinement of optical fields within the core region 
and low-radiation-loss bending with radius in the 
micron range realizable. 
  The propagation loss in such photonic wire 
structures can be mainly attributed to the scattering 
loss coming from the sidewall surface roughness 
and the intrinsic substrate leakage loss due to the 
same refractive index of the guiding core and 
substrate, both made of silicon. To decrease the 
scattering loss, the sidewalls in the structures 
should be as smooth as possible and thus many 
efforts have been made in reducing the sidewall 
roughness during the fabrication process [3]. On the 
other hand, accurate estimation of the leakage loss 
toward the substrate is quite essential in 
understanding the fundamental properties of 
photonic wire waveguides. To calculate the leakage 
loss toward the substrate, mode solvers with 
perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions 
[5] are often used to perform related calculations. 
Specifically, an eigenmode expansion mode solver 
and a mode solver based on the film mode matching 
(FMM) method are, respectively, utilized in [3] and [4] 
to calculate the leakage loss of photonic wires. In 
this paper, we analyze the same SOI photonic wires, 
as illustrated in Fig. 1, and calculate the leakage 
loss using the full-vectorial finite element 
imaginary-distance beam propagation method 
(FE-ID-BPM) with PMLs [6]. The guiding core of the 
SOI photonic wire in Fig. 1(a) is located on the top of 
the buried oxide cladding [3], while that in Fig. 1(b) 
is embedded in the buried oxide cladding [4]. For 
these two photonic wire structures, our calculation 
predicts smaller leakage losses compared with 
those values from [3] and [4]. To understand 
possible reasons causing this inconsistency, we 
examine the influence of computational domain size 
on the calculated values of leakage losses in detail.

THE FULL-VECTORIAL FINITE ELEMENT 
IMAGINARY-DISTANCE BEAM  
PROPAGATION METHOD 
  The FE method (FEM) has been a widely used 
numerical technique for waveguide mode analysis 
because of its accuracy and flexibility in modeling 
complicated waveguide structures. Therefore, in this 
work, a full-vectorial FE-ID-BPM code, as in [6], is 
established for the related waveguide analysis. To 
absorb waves out of the computational domain, the 
PML [7] is incorporated as the absorbing boundary 
condition (ABC) at computational domain edges. 
According to the imaginary part of the calculated 
complex effective index, the leakage loss of the 
guided mode can be evaluated. In our FE-ID-BPM, 
the waveguide cross-section is divided into hybrid
