Three mungbean sprout samples 
purchased from local market places were 
used for testing efficacy of different 
disinfection methods. Results indicated that 
soaking with tap water had minimal effect, 
while soaking in NaOCl, EO water and HS 
water, each containing 100 ppm of chlorine, 
eliminated 74%, 87% and 65%, respectively, 
of viable cells in the sprouts.

II?Introduction 
 
Living foods lifestyle has drawn 
attentions of many people who are aware of 
health; it is becoming more and more popular 
in around the world. Sprouts and seedling 
vegetables contain abundant amounts of all 
sorts of nutrients and are healthy and easy 
cultivating. Consumption of these foods is 
increasing dramatically each year. Production 
of the sprouts and seedling vegetables is not 
very complicated. It can be done in plant 
factories as well as in common household 
environment. However, growing conditions 
suitable for sprouts and seedling vegetables 
are also good for pathogenic microorganisms. 
Food poisoning outbreaks caused by 
consuming sprouts or seedling vegetables 
happen every year. Therefore, the purpose of 
this project is to study possible measures for 
eliminating microorganism contaminations 
and to improve growth and qualities of 
sprouts and seedling vegetables using 
disinfection waters, such as NaOCl, 
electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water and 
hypochlorite soft acid (HS) water. 
 
 
III?Results and discussion 
 
The project is divided into two parts. In 
the first part, effects of soaking time of seeds, 
cultivation temperature, type of cultivation 
water, and addition of cultivation adjunct on 
sprouting rate, growth rate, harvest index, 
and qualities of the mungbean sprouts were 
studied.  
Results of the experiments on growth 
conditions indicated that growth curves of 
mungbean sprouts could be well-fitted with 
Gompertz models. Type of cultivation water 
was the major factor affecting growth rate of 
the sprouts. Sprouts cultivated with tap water 
yielded higher harvest index (8.09) than 
those with reverse osmosis (RO) water (6.04).
