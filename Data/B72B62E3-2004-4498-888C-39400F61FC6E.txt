Keywords：UWB,CPW-fed,planar slot

       In this report, we propose various planar 
slot antennas fed by CPW for UWB 
communication-system applications. Based 
on the multiple-resonance concept, an 
elliptical slot antenna with an elliptical stub 
fed by CPW is presented first and discussed 
why it has ultra-wide bandwidth. The antenna 
is fabricated and experimental results show 
that its impedance bandwidth can cover 
frequencies from 3.1 to 10.6GHz, which 
meets the system requirements. Then, we 
propose a band-notched elliptical slot antenna 
to overcome interference with some already 
existing standards such as the IEEE802.11a 
and HyperLan/2A systems. This planar slot 
antenna, using open-end slits on the tuning 
stub or a pair of parasitic strips in the aperture 
is designed to reject the sub-band between 
5-6GHz. Measurement results show that this 
antenna not only retains an ultra-wide 
bandwidth but also has band-rejection 
capability. Finally, a compact and novel 
folded slot antenna, which its size is shrunken 
to a half of the original curved-shape structure, 
is proposed for wireless USB-dongle 
applications. From experimental results, it is 
found that it still preserved UWB 
characteristics although its radiation pattern 
seems not perfect for ultra-wideband 
transmission. 
 
二、前言(Introduction) 
 4 
advantages of the slot antenna are low 
manufacturing cost, broad-bandwidth, and 
easy compatibility with radio frequency 
/microwave integrated circuits. Lately, much 
research has been carried out regarding the 
design of planar slot antennas for UWB 
applications [5-9]. According the above 
research, the slot antenna can provide an 
ultra-wide operating bandwidth, especially for 
wide slots embedded with a modified 
tuning-stub. Slot antennas with various tuning 
stubs have been reported to be suitable for 
ultra-wideband purposes. In addition, many 
literatures have been published on UWB 
antenna with band-notched characteristics 
[8-10]. However, some of these structures are 
too large for real applications, such as a 
wireless USB dongle [11]. Recently, for 
shrinking the geometry size, Ding applied 
multiple-ring-resonators printed inside the 
inner patch to achieve multiple notch 
frequency bands [9].  
 
四、研究方法(Methods) 
 
    To design a planar slot antenna, the 
area of an elliptical slot is greatly concerned 
with frequency for its lower edge of the 
impedance bandwidth. Shown in Fig.1 (a) is a 
configuration of an elliptical aperture antenna. 
The major and minor axis of the elliptical slot 
are A and B, respectively. According to the 
empirical formula [6], it can be revised to

where lf  is the frequency (in gigahertz) 
corresponding to the lower edge of the -10 dB 
impedance bandwidth, A and B are in 
millimeters. Element factor C for elliptical 
slot is equal to 0.22 while the scope of the 
axial ratio (A/B) is about 1.5. Once the 
designed lowest frequency for UWB is 
assigned, geometry sizes will be decided. 
The proposed UWB antennas are shown 
in Fig. 1(a)-(d). Shown in the Fig. 1(a) is an 
original UWB antenna with an elliptical stub, 
Fig. 1(b) is a band-notched antenna using a 
pair of open-end slits on the tuning stub, and 
Fig. 1(c) is a band-notched antenna using a 
pair of parasitic strips in the aperture. The 
edge-CPW fed slot antenna is shown in Fig. 
1(d). The antenna consists of an elliptical slot 
which is etched out from the conductor plane 
of a printed circuit board. This UWB antenna 
is fed by a 50Ω CPW transmission line with a 
tuning stub for impedance matching. They are 
fabricated on the substrate with thickness 1.6 
mm and relative permittivity εr=4.4. The total 
antenna size is only 30×25×1.6 mm3, that is, 
the dimension is less than quarter wavelength 
for the lowest operating frequency, 3.1GHz.  
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the 50Ω CPW 
transmission line (w=1.4 mm and g=0.25mm) 
is used to capacitively excite the input signal 
into the elliptical aperture at the lower 
frequency band. The central signal strip of the 
feeding CPW is extended into the aperture for 
a length t to connect with the tuning stub 
which is symmetrically positioned with the 
elliptical slot. The ultra-wide bandwidths are 
due to the multiple resonances introduced by 
the combination of the elliptical slot and the 
elliptical tuning stub [6]. For achieving 
efficient excitation and good impedance 
-matching, the size and position of the stub 
must be designed carefully right from the 
beginning. Before cutting slits in the stub or 
inserting parasitic strips in the aperture, the 
elliptical slot-antenna can provide an 
ultra-wide operating bandwidth of 3.1-10.6 
GHz. 
Inside the elliptical aperture as shown in 
Fig. 1(a), a pair of open-end slits is embedded 
into the circular stub. The structure is shown 
in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 2(a) shows the field 
distributions of the original slot antenna in 
region A near the stub and in region B near the 
feeding position. The fact that the field 
distributions are strong indicates that the 
current distribution on the conductor are 
strong near the region A. Cutting out some 
conductor on the stub to form symmetrical 
quarter-wavelength slits at 5.5GHz can 
deteriorate the current near the region A, as 
shown in Fig. 2(b). One end of the slits is open 
but the other end is closely connected to the 
CPW transmission line. Since the input

application. Compared to the original design, 
this band-notch antenna successfully blocks 
out the 5-6GHz band and still has good 
impedance matching at other frequency 
bands. 
Fig. 4 shows the measured and simulated 
VSWR for the UWB antenna with parasitic 
strips. The proposed band-notched antenna 
exhibits a notch frequency band centered at 
5.5GHz. Investigating the input impedance by 
Smith chart, it is found that minimum 
resistance (singular impedance) creates a   
short-load and thus causes rejection, which is 
the basic design concept of band rejection. 
However, the thin parasitic-strips which are 
half-wavelength will induce resonance. Some 
radiation is generated so that it causes the 
VSWR to drop slightly. A completely 
band-notched function is not easy to be 
obtained due to radiation loss and substrate 
loss. However, the resonant frequencies of the 
simulation and measurement results are in 
good agreement. 
 The measured gain of the designed 
antenna is presented in Fig. 5. The gain was 
measured in the NTUEE’s anechoic chamber. 
It was found that the gain (in dB) for the band 
from 3GHz to 10GHz is between -1 to 12 dBi 
for this antenna outside the rejected band. The 
gain in the rejected band is found to be as low 
as -4.5 dB. The difference between the 
original and the band-rejected antenna is 
about 7 dB, which means that 80 percent of 
the power input to the UWB antenna is 
rejected to avoid interference with existing 
WLAN systems. 
About the edge-fed folded slot antenna, a 
compact planar antenna that originally 
consists of a pair of symmetrically curved 
radiating-slot fed by coplanar waveguide is 
studied to achieve UWB requirement. Then, 
using HFSS to analyze and revise the folded 
antenna shown in Fig. 1(d), the impedance 
bandwidth and return loss of this shrunken 
UWB antenna are investigated. If the aperture 
length of one side is adjusted to about a 
half-wavelength at the lower-edge frequency 
of the desired band, an ultra bandwidth can be 
achieved. Fig. 6 shows the measured results 
compared with the simulated results. 
Obviously, comparing the measured and 
simulated results, we can find that the wide 
bandwidth of the folded-slot antenna starts 
from 2.87GHz to 11GHz. Its measured 
bandwidth is more than 8.13GHz with VSWR 
< 2 (return loss less than -10dB). The 
difficulty on manufacturing this antenna 
results in some unavoidable error about 
resonating frequencies, but the behavior of the 
simulated and measured results are similar.  
According to the UWB point of view for 
applications, the antenna is required to have 
near omni-directional radiation-pattern. This 
requirement is confirmed achieved by 
measured patterns. All patterns of the UWB 
antennas in this report are characterized in the 
NTUT’s anechoic chamber. Anechoic 
chamber patterns were measured with 
co-polarization and cross-polarization at the 
different resonating frequencies. There were 
taken at resonating frequencies of 3.5GHz, 
4.5GHz, and 9.5GHz, respectively. Fig. 7(a) 
shows the measured patterns on the yz-plane 
(H-plane) for the UWB antenna with 
open-end slits. The patterns in the H-plane do 
not change much outside the band-rejection 
band. The-cross polarization leads to a 
directional pattern in the H-plane at 3.5GHz 
and bi-directional pattern at 9GHz. Fig. 7(b) 
shows the measured patterns on the xz-plane 
(E-plane) at 3.5GHz, 4.5GHz, and 9.5GHz, 
respectively. The co-polarization still has 
directional pattern in the E-plane due to 
dipole-like behavior. Fig. 8(a) and 8(b) show 
the measured patterns for UWB antenna using 
parasitic strips. It is also found that their 
behaviors are similar to those patterns using 
open-slits. 
The radiation patterns of the novel 
folded-slot antenna were measured in an 
NTUT’s anechoic chamber. Fig. 9(a) shows 
the measured H-plane (yz-plane) radiation 
patterns. From the results, when it radiates at 
7GHz, there are some nulls in the radiation 
pattern due to this is slightly weak electronic 
field or maybe spurious mode of folded CPW 
excited. Fig. 9(b) shows the measured E plane

frequency 3.1GHz. The parameters of the first design are L=17.664mm, W=25.6mm, R1=3.6mm, 
R2=5.5mm, S1=0.9mm and S2=S3=1mm, as shown in Fig.1(a). The parameters of the second 
design are L=17.112mm, W=24.8mm, R1=4.75mm, S1=20.8mm, and S2=19.2mm, as shown in 
Fig.1 (b). 
As shown in the Fig.1, the 50Ω CPW transmission line is used to capacitively excite the 
input signal into the elliptical aperture. A circular stub of radius R1 is embedded inside the 
aperture. This circular tuning stub is used to enhance the bandwidth. The ultra-wide bandwidths 
are due to the multiple resonances introduced by the combination of the elliptical slot and the 
circular tuning stub [3]. The central signal strip of the feeding CPW is extended into the aperture 
for a length H to connect with the tuning stub which is symmetrically positioned with the 
elliptical slot. For achieving efficient excitation and good impedance-matching, the size and 
position of the circular stub must be carefully designed in the beginning. If no embedded slits in 
the stub or parasitic strip in the aperture are embedded, the elliptical slot antenna with the 
dimensions chosen in the study of the first-stage can offer an UWB operating bandwidth of 3.1-
10.6 GHz. The dash line shown in Fig.2 is the original simulation results. It is demonstrated the 
designed antenna can achieve the UWB system requirement. 
Inside the elliptical aperture shown in Fig.1 (a), a pair of open-end slits is embedded into the 
circular stub. Position of the slits and their widths are selected to control the desired rejection 
band. Design parameters R1, R2, S1, S2, and S3 are optimized by the simulation tool. While the slit 
length of one side is adjusted to be about a quarter-wavelength at the center frequency of the 
desired band, a narrow bandwidth can be notched out while still keeping good impedance 
matching for the rest of ultra-wide bandwidth. 
Inside the elliptical aperture shown in Fig.1 (b), a pair of parasitic strips is inserted into the 
suitable aperture-region to disturb the field distribution that will resonate at the designed notch-
band. While the total length of this pairs of parasitic strip is adjusted to be about a half-
wavelength at the center frequency of the desired notch-band, resonance will occur at the strip but 
not at the aperture. Then, a notched frequency band at 5.5GHz can thus be created to reduce the 
interference with the sign from WLAN. 
 
Ⅲ. Numerical and measured results The proposed antennas were fabricated and 
experiment was performed using Agilent E5071B Network Analyzer. Fig.2 (a) shows the 
simulated and measured results for the structure shown in Fig.1 (a). The simulation results for the 
antenna without open-end slit are also shown in the figure for comparison. Shown in Fig.2 (b) are 
the simulated and measured results for the VSWR versus frequency for the designed antenna 
shown in Fig.1 (b). Increasing the length of parasitic strips will shift the rejection band to a lower 
value. In the pass-band, the VSWR characteristics of the original UWB antenna are only slightly
