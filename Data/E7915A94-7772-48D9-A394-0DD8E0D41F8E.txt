An important consideration in the design of H controllers is the optimal
norm of the H control problem. This value determines the lowest value of the
H norm that can be obtained with the problem and system defined. Hence, it
represents a design limit, but one that is computationally intractable and difficult to
obtain. A new method for determining the optimal H norm of a closed-loop
system is presented. The new method is computationally far less intense as it does not
require repeated solution of eigenvalues or matrix Riccati equations. It is based on
the application of Routh-Hurwitz theorem and the classical Routh table to the
Hamiltonian matrix for the H problem. The overall approach requires a minimal
number of iterations as an interpolation scheme is presented that enables a highly
accurate approximation of the optimal value. Four test cases of increasing complexity
are presented with errors of 0.01-1.5% in the optimal value obtained.

3In contrast, non-iterative methods (Chen et al. 1992a, Chen et al. 1992b, Chen et al. 1992c, Chen et al. 1996,
Chen 1997, Chu 2004) can directly compute the infimum, , without iteration. However, certain intricate
transformations are necessary to first transform the original problem of computing  into mathematically
feasible forms. These transformations are followed by the solution of an ARE, a Lyapunov equation and an
eigenvalue problem. Accordingly, the computational efficiency may not be significantly better with non-iterative
algorithms. In addition, ill-conditioning can result from the required transformations (Chu, 2004).
In this paper, a computationally efficient iterative algorithm is developed for the determination of  by
taking a completely novel approach. First, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix associated with the H
ARE problem are examined to define a borderline stability criterion associated with the H problem infimum.
Based on this stability criterion, the classical Routh-Hurwitz theorem is employed to check the system stability,
requiring only the characteristic polynomial coefficients of the Hamiltonian matrix for any given value of .
Moreover, it is shown that the characteristic polynomial can be analytically expressed in terms ofand thus used
to economically obtain the polynomial coefficients corresponding to various values of required in the iteration
process. With the combination of these ingredients, a novel Routh-Hurwitz based method to compute the optimal
H norm can then be established for state feedback problems. Several numerical examples are demonstrated to
validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the newly developed method, including the single-degree-of-freedom
(SDOF) structural control problem, which has been shown to possess a closed-form solution for  in the
literature (Wu and Lin 2004, Wu and Zeng 2006).
2. Problem statement and stability criterion
2.1. Problem statement
Consider the standard linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined:

where the state nRx , the control input mRu , the disturbance lRw , and the regulated
output pRz . In addition, A, B, E, C and D are constant matrices of appropriate dimension.
If state feedback, u = Gx, is considered, the closed-loop system is defined:

To obtain this nn Riccati matrix P , it is most convenient to transform equation (7) into a

H  (9)
Thus, P can be directly obtained from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H (Meirovitch,
1990).
2.2. Stability criterion
Since equation (7) is a quadratic matrix equation, more than one solution for P can be obtained.
To guarantee the stability of the controlled system, a positive semi-definite, symmetric solution,
0T PP , is required. Thus, a possible stability criterion is to check if there exists a positive
semi-definite, symmetric P for each value of . This stability criterion is computationally
expensive, as it requires solving an ARE each iteration, which includes a potentially
ill-conditioned eigenvalue problem.
A similar, but numerically efficient and novel, stability criterion is adopted in this study by
examining the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix in equation (9). This matrix is known as
it is only composed of a given value and constant matrices A, B, C, D and E that define the
control problem. Since H is a nn 22  matrix, there are 2n eigenvalues with 2n corresponding
eigenvectors. It is clear that all the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix clA are
included in those of H with the transformation from equations (7) to (9) (Meirovitch, 1990).
Moreover, Potter (1966) also proved that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix H appear
in anti-symmetric pairs n  ,,, 21  in the complex plane.
7repeats the procedure for smaller values until the stability limit is reached. Unstable iterations
that pass  can be used to further refine the search using any number of bisection schemes.
Note that a similar bisection scheme based on properties of the eigenvalues of H has been
investigated by Boyd et al. (1989). In that paper an iterative method was set up using a Sturm
sequence to test when H has no purely imaginary eigenvalues. A Sturm test was related to a
Routh array (Gantmacher 1959) for a real-valued characteristic polynomial. However, each step
of the iterative method of Boyd et al. (1989) requires the evaluation of the characteristic
polynomial of H using the Leverrier-Faddeeva algorithm, which requires order 4n
multiplications for an nn matrix (Hou 1998). Given that the bisection method of Boyd et al.
(1989) can be slow to converge, with up to 20 iterations typically reported, this approach would
lead to excessive computational requirements, especially for large n.
Furthermore, Boyd et al. (1989) did not fully utilize the Routh-Hurwitz theorem by looking
for borderline stability or zeros in the Routh table. Finally, these methods only relate to LTI
systems with no disturbance input w in equation (1). Thus, they do not deal with the case of
real multiple roots and are not applicable to equation (1) in this paper.
In this section, a method is developed for the evaluation of the characteristic polynomial
which is analytically based, and utilizes the structure of the Hamiltonian matrix H which is
directly dependent on the type of disturbance input w and requires very minimal computation.
The Routh-Hurwitz theorem provides an expedient procedure to test the stability of a system
merely from the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial, without actually evaluating any
eigenvalues. Therefore, the computation to solve ARE’s or LMI’s in other iterative methods
can be avoided. Instead, simple calculations using only the polynomial coefficients are required
with the application of Routh-Hurwitz theorem. Also using the result of the Routh-Hurwitz

First, consider the case 1r . From equation (14) it suffices to show that  ARdet is

where equation (18) is the standard expansion of the determinant and equation (19) follows
from the fact that for 1)rank( rR , the determinant of any matrix involving two or more
columns of R must be zero.
For 2)rank( rR , expanding equation (17) will again give terms that are linear in 
as given in equation (19), but in this case there will be extra terms involving 2 of the form
  njjjiii AARAARAA ||||||||||det 11111   
  njjjiii AARAARAA ||||||||||det 111112   (20)
for all   jinji  ,,,1,  , excluding the degenerate case where iR and jR are dependent,
which would not contribute to a term in 2 . And all other terms will involve at least three
columns of R so that their determinant must all be zero since 2)rank( rR in this case.
Similarly for r > 2, the expansion of equation (17) will involve r ,,, 2  , thus completing
the proof. █

Considering the fact that the eigenvalues of H exist in anti-symmetric pairs with opposite
signs, the polynomial of equation (12) has to be even and so the special case of the
Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion and table must be applied (Gantmacher 1959). Following
Gantmacher (1959) and considering a characteristic polynomial of H:

This section presents numerical examples from the area of structural control to demonstrate the
methods presented. The initial case has a previously published analytical solution to further
demonstrate the accuracy of the method.
4.1. Example 1: SDOF structural control case
A typical SDOF structural system is first taken as a demonstrative example to illustrate the
Routh-Hurwitz based method developed in this study. With mass m, stiffness k, and damping c,
its natural frequency and damping ratio are defined: )/( mk and )2/(  mc . If C and
D are defined corresponding to the H energy control case in the literature (Wu and Lin

200  and the least squares interpolating cubic of step 5. Note that the curve in Figure 3 is
similar to Figure 2 but is more non-linear and has the first zero-crossing much closer to zero.
The first real root of the least squares interpolating cubic was at 318.0 which
corresponds to the output of 89.9*  in step 5. In this case, the crossover point where the
eigenvalues of H in the more exact solution become purely imaginary was between 03.10* 
and 04.10*  . Thus, the percentage error in the approximation is approximately %4.1 .
However after re-applying steps 3 to 6 of the algorithm using 5 equally spaced values of 
from 0L to 1R , the output of step 5 was 00.10*  which corresponds to a
percentage error of %1.0 .
Therefore, a more reasonable initial choice of L and R in step 3 can significantly
increase accuracy. The result also indicates a potential limitation of the methods presented
depending on the accuracy desired. The following example demonstrates an approach to
automating the choice of L and R to alleviate this issue.
4.4. Example 4: general control case
Finally, a more general case of a randomly generated stable matrix A and a matrix E
corresponding to a multi-input case is considered for the 16-DOF case presented in Section 4.3.
The matrix A is chosen by generating a random 3232 stable matrix with entries that are
normally distributed about a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The matrix E is chosen to
be:

The values of L and R for this example are consequently chosen to be 0L and
4.2R .
Applying steps 4 to 6 in the algorithm based on the above values of  gives
1997.0)2376.2( 2*   . This value is close to the actual value of 1999.0*  , computed
directly with eigenvalue methods, with an error of %1.0 . Figure 5 shows the values of  and
the interpolating polynomial whose first zero crossing corresponds to * . Note that in this case,
unlike the interpolations in Figures 2 and 3, the result is definitely cubic and could not be
readily approximated by a linear interpolation function as in Figures 2 and 3. This result is due
to the additional inputs for this more general case. For a single input the results are essentially
linear in , whereas they are higher order with increasing inputs, as might be expected.
5. Conclusions
A new method for determining the optimal H norm, or infimum, of a closed-loop system
has been developed and presented. The new method is computationally far less intense as it
does not require repeated solution of eigenvalues or matrix Riccati equations. The method is
based on the application of Routh-Hurwitz theorem and the application of the classical Routh
table to check a stability condition on the Hamiltonian matrix that is associated with the
infimum value. In addition, a method of interpolating to obtain an approximation of the optimal
result is presented that reduces the number of Routh table solutions required. As a result, the
approach provides the desired result with minimum computation compared to other approaches
in the literature.
Four test cases are presented and errors in the approximate solution versus published
results and iterative eigenvalue solutions are within 1.5%. Using an automated method of
determining a reasonable range to check can reduce this error to less than 0.1%, providing
significant accuracy. Overall, the methods and theory presented comprise a Routh-Hurwitz
based semi-analytical minimal iteration approach for determining the H norm infimum of a

Abstract
The cables of cable-stayed bridges are the primary force-transmitting members of the whole system.
Consequently, the measurements and subsequent system identification of the cables play extremely
important roles in health monitoring of the whole cable-stayed bridge. It is aimed in this study to
develop an effective method to identify the parameters of the first several modes merely based on the
ambient vibration measurement of a single station installed on cables. A mode separation technique is
first introduced to extract the independent contributions to the measured signal of cable from individual
modes. A novel multiple random decrement method is subsequently proposed to successfully exclude
the effects from background excitation forces and extract the free vibration response for each mode.
With the combination of the above two techniques, the Ibrahim time domain method is then adequately
applied to independently identify the individual parameters for each mode. Demonstrated by applying it
to the measured velocity record of a cable of the Chi-Lu cable-stayed bridge, the validation of this
method is also provided in this paper.
1 Introduction
The cables of cable-stayed bridges are the primary force-transmitting members of the whole structure
system. Consequently, the measurements and subsequent system identification of the cables play
extremely important roles either in the stability analysis of cables or in health monitoring of the whole
cable-stayed bridge. The dynamic response of the cable usually attributes to quite a few of the lower
modes due to its low flexural stiffness. It is accordingly required to obtain the modal parameters of
more modes in the identification of cable than other civil structures.
With the advantages of mobility and easy setup, the technique of ambient vibration measurement has
been recently applied to conduct the system identification for most of the cable-stayed bridges. Since
only the output signal is available from ambient vibration measurements, it is necessary to apply the
system identification techniques based merely on output signals for determining the modal parameters
of cables. Limited by in situ working constraints, it is usually difficult to conduct the measurement with
multiple stations uniformly distributed along the same cable. Moreover, the insignificant signals from
ambient vibration also induce problems such as noise pollution in practical applications. To tackle the
above problems in applying ambient vibration measurements for the identification of cables of
cable-stayed bridges, it is aimed in this study to develop an effective method for accurately identifying

all those time histories to yield the corresponding random decrement signature ( )y . Since
( )i sx t x  for all N different time instants, (0) sy x  is guaranteed.
2.2 Ibrahim Time Domain Method
If the random decrement signature can be obtained from the ambient vibration measurements of cables
and sufficiently represents the corresponding free vibration response, ITD can then be applied to
determine the associated modal dynamic parameters. Consider the free vibration system illustrated in
Eq. (3), but replace the time variable by t. Transformation of this equation into the state space further
results in a first-order differential equation:

where U and V are 2n s matrices and Ψ and Ψˆ are 2 2n n matrices. Examination of Eq. (9)
reveals that if a system related matrix A is defined as
( ) ( ) ( )i i ix t y t z t  (17)
where ( )iy t is its corresponding transient part related only to the initial conditions and totally
controlled by the i-th modal frequency. As for ( )iz t , it represents the corresponding steady state part,
which is related to the frequency content of excitation force as well as the i-th modal frequency of
system. If the frequency content of external excitation is well distributed, ( )iz t would be dominated
by the i-th modal frequency. In case the excitation force is mainly composed of certain specific
frequencies, the frequency content of ( )iz t would be concentrated on the i-th modal frequency
together with those specific excitation frequencies.
As previously mentioned, conducting the RD method on a signal as that in Eq. (16) is nothing but
extracting several time histories with the same duration dT from different initial instants and then
superposing all of them. Since all these extracted time histories have the same peak contributions at the
same modal frequencies of system, the contributions from those modal frequencies on the summarized
signal will be constructively amplified. On the other hand, the contributions from the remaining minor
frequencies will destructively cancel each other due to the difference in phase angles (Ref [2]). In other
words, the effect of performing the RD method is to further enhance the contributions of the peak
frequencies in the original signal. Hence, the resulted RD signature would be almost constituted by all
the modal frequencies and corresponds to a free vibration signal if the excitation is close to a white
noise. As for the cases where the excitation force focuses on certain frequencies, Eq. (1) demonstrates
that the existence of ( )iy t still guarantees the advantages of the modal frequencies over the major
excitation frequencies during the process of superposition. In this situation, the obtained RD signature
may not totally exclude the effects from the major excitation frequencies, but at least significantly
deduct their influences.
The ambient vibration measurement for a cable numbered L17 (length = 76.4 m and inclined angle =
31) of the Chi-Lu cable-stayed bridge close to the epicenter of 1999 Ch-Chi earthquake occurred in
Taiwan can be taken as an example to further illustrate the above discussions. In Figures 1 and 2,
respectively, the originally measured velocity signal and its corresponding RD signature (cutting
threshold 0.8 standard deviation of the original measurement and dT half of the original time
history) are displayed in both forms of time history and Fourier amplitude spectrum. It is noteworthy in
Figure 1 that all the cable frequencies are nearly in an arithmetic sequence, as predicted by the string
theory. However, there exist two additional peak frequencies small than the first modal frequency of
cable. These two extra peak frequencies actually appear in the Fourier amplitude spectrum of each
cable of the Chi-Lu bridge and have been pointed out to be corresponding to two significant modal
frequencies of the bridge deck (Ref [3]). From the cables standpoint, these two frequencies can be
regarded as the particularly concentrated parts in the frequency content of external excitation. Even in
this case where the excitation is far away from a white noise, Figure 2 indicates that the contributions
from these two non-cable frequencies have been considerably suppressed after conducting the RD
method due to the reasons stated above. At this point, we have actually extended the mathematical basis
for applying the RD method. Namely, in the cases where the excitation force is not close to a white
mid-points between any two adjacent modal frequencies are adopted to divide the frequency ranges for
different modes. The corresponding time history for each separated mode is subsequently obtained by
performing the inverse Fourier transform. Finally, the MRD method together with the ITD method can
be independently applied on these individual modal responses to identify the dynamic parameters for
each mode.
To more explicitly explain the proposed methodology, Cable 17 of the Chi-Lu bridge is again taken as
an example. The parameters for the first 10 modes of this cable are aimed for identification. After the
mode separation is performed as previously described, the MRD technique is applied on each separated
modal time history with a cutting threshold 0.8 standard deviation of the target time history and
dT half of the original time history for each round of RD. The MRD method is set to stop before the
criterion of 100N  can not be guaranteed. In addition, the ITD technique is also utilized to identify
the corresponding parameters after each round of RD. As mentioned in Ref [3], several values of the
time shifting parameter m required in the ITD method are adopted for the identification of different
modes such that the time shifting for each mode is in consistent correspondence to 1/4 of each modal
period. The identified parameter values for each mode in all the RD rounds are arranged and listed in
Table 1. Based on these results, it is obvious that the identified modal frequencies are almost the same
in all different rounds of RD. Considering the fact that the modal frequencies can be clearly
distinguished in the Fourier amplitude spectrum of the measured signal, it is not surprising that they are
accurately obtained since the first round of RD. More importantly, the conventionally ambiguous modal
damping ratios all reach stably convergent values, usually with very few rounds of RD. This trend
shows that not a lot of RD rounds are required to obtain satisfactory parameters from identification and
also indicates the effective performance of the approach proposed in this study. Furthermore, it is also
observed that the cable indeed possesses very light modal damping ratios, basically all less than 0.1%.
This phenomenon further confirms the slight damping premise where the mode separation technique is
based.
5 Conclusions
Fully taking advantage of the dynamic characteristics of the cables of cable-stayed bridges, a system
identification methodology is delicately developed in this study to sufficiently filter out the effects from
the external excitations and accurately estimate the modal damping ratios of cable covering a number of
different modes. A mode separation technique is first introduced to extract the independent
contributions to the measured signal of cable from individual modes. A novel multiple random
decrement method is subsequently proposed to successfully exclude the effects from background
excitation forces and extract the free vibration response for each mode. With the combination of the
above two techniques, the Ibrahim time domain method is then adequately applied to independently
identify the individual parameters for each mode. Demonstrated by applying it to the measured velocity
record of a cable of the Chi-Lu cable-stayed bridge, the validation of this method is also provided in
this paper.
