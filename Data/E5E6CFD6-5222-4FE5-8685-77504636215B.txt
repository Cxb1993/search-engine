 還是值得釐清與探討的。加上在實測上會有許多環境與
運轉上的限制問題，因此本研究以模擬方式比較與觀察
風力發電機併入前後電壓閃爍值，以了解與釐清負載與
風力發電機對電壓閃爍值的影響關係。 
本研究以 IEC 61400-21閃爍係數與階梯係數評估方
法，評估台電麥寮風力發電系統，在連續運轉與切換運
轉下之電壓閃爍程度，並探討電壓閃爍為限制值下之短
路比(Short Circuit Ratio, SCR)與風機數。 
 
II.風力發電機及系統描述 
本研究主要探討比較 SCIG 與 DFIG 兩種風力發電
機所產生的電壓閃爍問題，並兩種風機組所產生的電壓
閃爍問題差異性。 
    本研究以一簡化風力發電系統進行模擬與探討，簡
化單線圖如圖 1 所示。圖中 WT 為風渦輪機，IG 為非同
步感應發電機 DFIG 與 SCIG，C 為補償電容，經一

IV. SCIG 與 DFIG 模擬比較  
 4.1 風的擾動  
    風的擾動是風力發電機產生電壓閃爍的主要原
因，在風速超過額定後，葉片的控制轉速方式與槳具的
響應速度也是影響因子之一。本研究中葉片採用旋角控
制系統，旋角控制系統在低於額定風速時葉片角度維持
在最佳迎風角度，在超過額定後利用改變葉片迎風角度
來影響與控制葉片轉速。 
   旋角控制中每秒最大改變角度可反應出葉片槳具
的響應速度，因此使用不同每秒最大改變角度進行模
擬，圖 4 為 SCIG 的模擬結果，在不同的平均風速下紀

角度 10 度兩種葉片響應速度，模擬使用電網參數：短
路容量 20 MVA，X/R=7。模擬結果擾動風速在平均風速
增加至 12 m/s 時，部分風速超過額定 15 m/s 時，旋角控
制系統啟動，葉片角度開始改變，因此在曲線一與曲線
二兩種不同的葉片角度響應速度下，在超過平均風速 12 
m/s 時，曲線一與曲線二之 stP 值開始有所差異，很明
顯的曲線二 stP 值大於曲線一。在平均風速 15~17 m/s
時，大部分風速超過額定，在旋角控制的壓制下擾動較
為平緩，在平均風速 19~20 m/s 時，曲線一與曲線二 stP
值開始上升，曲線二以更高的比例上升，主要是因為葉
片角度響應速度與對應風速之旋角放大角度不夠，旋角
控制不足以完全壓制大幅變動的擾動風速，使得輸出產
生較大的震盪，而使得 stP 值開始上升，曲線一有較快
的葉片響應速度，因此上升曲線較曲線二緩慢。

    本研究應用 DFIG 在不穩定負載下，比較與觀察風
力發電機併入前後電壓閃爍值，模擬中假設負載快速擾
動而產生電壓波動，負載功因維持 0.8。未併入風機前
PCC 點電壓如圖 9 所示，負載端電壓隨著負載變動下產
生波動，短時間電壓閃爍值 stP =0.475.

圖 10 負載變動下，風機併入後 PCC 點瞬間電壓 
  併入風機後測量負載端電壓，結果如圖 10 所示，
負載端電壓隨著負載變動下產生波動，短期電壓閃爍值
stP =0.456。比較圖 9 與圖 10 風機併入前與併入後 PCC
點電壓，在電壓不斷波動下，難以看出風機併入前後的
差異性，不過在風機併入後負載端電壓約上升了 0.005 
p.u，而從電壓閃爍觀察，在風機併入運轉後 stP 值略微
降低，證明 DFIG 併入運轉並不會造成電壓閃爍程度的
增加。分別在不同程度的負載擾動下 PCC 點的 stP 值結

Abstract 
The electric power system is an enabling infrastructure that supports the operation of other critical infrastructures and thus the economic well being of a ‐
nation. It is, therefore, very important to design for resiliency and autonomous reconfigurability in the electric power grid to guard against man made and ‐
natural disasters. One way to assure such self healing characteristics‐  in an electric power system is to design for small and autonomous subsets of the larger 
grid. This lecture presents the concept of a microgrid called an Intelligent Distributed Autonomous Power System (IDAPS). The IDAPS microgrid aims at 
intelligently managing customer owned distributed energy‐  resources and end use demand such that these assets can be shared in the most‐  optimum way both 
during normal and outage operations. The operation of the electric power grid in the IDAPS configuration is expected to provide protocols for load and 
distributed generation controls, thus providing an opportunity for electricity transaction among electric utility customers. 
 
Keynote Speech: New Issues in Deregulated Power Markets and Practical Use of 
Sustainable Energy 
Speaker: Prof. Ryuichi Yokoyama, Waseda University, Japan 
Time: 10:20-11:00, March 29, 2009 
Location: East Lake Ballroom, 5th floor, Ramada Hotel 
 
Abstract 
Deregulation of electric industries and creation of competitive power markets has been a main stream throughout the world aiming at reduction of the 
electricity price, diversity of customer’s choices and services and promotion of new business keeping supply reliability. However, the deregulation of electric 
industries, the consequent open access to transmission networks and harsh competitions in power markets forced the power system developers and operators to 
face with various new problems. In front runners that introduced the deregulation of electric industries swiftly such as United States, Europe and others, a large 
variety of negative matters happed in power systems and markets, that is energy crisis in California (1999), price manipulation of markets (2000), the historical 
largest scale blackouts (2003) transmission congestion, deterioration of supply reliability, insufficient adequacy of generations and transmission lines and recent 
up-keeping of electricity prices. 
Under such circumstances surrounding competitive power markets, practical use of renewable and distributed energy generation offers an attractive 
alternative for power supply and is a match for expansion and constructions of nuclear power plants to solve the critical matters.? Their advantages are a short 
construction cycle, being less of a burden to the existing transmission network, as it can be located near to the demand, and contributing to prevention of global 
warming through clean combustion using novel energy technologies such as natural gas co-generation, natural gas micro turbines, or fuel cells. Distributed 
generations using renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy are also attracting attention.

will be 1360GW. The power system is composed of generating companies, grid companies and power supervising institutions mainly in China. The “East-West 
power transmission, nationwide electricity interconnection and deregulated market” brings the challenges of the security, the stability and the basic research in 
power system in China. The blackouts reveal the hidden trouble in the security defense of power system. Then the framework of dynamic security defense in 
power system is constructed based on EMS and WAMS. On this platform, Static Security Assessment (SSA), Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA), Transient 
Security Assessment (TSA) and Emergency Security Assessment (ESA) would be realized. At last the security stability control is achieved by the key 
technologies of wide-area protection, control and high speed information system in the deregulated market. The major problems and the research directions of 
wide-area security defense system include: (1) Increasing of transmission capacity. UHV AC/DC power transmission technology, compact line, large section 
line, fixed series compensator, FACTS and super-conductive power transmission technology are adopted to improve the capacity of transmission lines. (2) 
Modeling and simulation for the loads. According to the wide-area dynamic characteristic modeling and parameter, based on the inversive simulations, the 
operation performance of the load model have been approached to the real physical process of practical power system to improve the accuracy and the 
reliability for the system security analysis. (3) The simulation theory and technique for the large-scale power system. The security analysis and the cooperation 
simulation for large scale power gird will achieved by the distributed calculation model and the arithmetic for the bulk interconnected network. (4) Monitoring 
and control for Low frequency oscillation. The power system can be controlled by open-loop suppression and closed-loop control, due to the mode of low 
frequency oscillations which are monitored by WAMS. (5) Transient security defense system. Emergency control is established for the transient security defense 
based on monitoring to the transient unstable torque-angle caused by the serious disturbances. (6) Wide-area dynamic information system. With the 
development of GPS and the modern high-speed digital communication networks, wide-area torque-angle measured system is constructed as a strong 
foundation for the dynamic security analysis from "on-line" to "real-time". 
 
Invited Speech: Integrating Renewable Resources with a Smart Grid 
Speaker: Prof. Felix F. Wu, Hong Kong University, China 
Time: 14:30-15:00, March 29, 2009 
Location: East Lake Ballroom-I, 5th floor, Ramada Hotel 
 
Abstract 
Traditional dispatch is based on the worst-case consideration and uses (N-1)-criterion. The introduction of renewable resources into the grid requires the 
management and dispatch of power systems with a smart grid that encompasses high-resolution sensor and monitoring equipments, high-bandwidth 
communication network and powerful and intelligent information processing. The intermittent and stochastic nature of renewable resources requires a new 
paradigm for operation. A risk-limiting dispatch framework for future power systems is introduced. The framework can be used for cost-benefit assessment of 
smart grids.
