Abstract 
In order to prevent power system blackout and enhance system reliability, various forms of 
special protection systems (SPS) have been implemented by utilities around the world. One of the 
main concerns in the design of an SPS is to assure whether the system could fit with the 
reliability specification requirements. The failure of SPS to detect the defined conditions and 
carry out the required actions, or to take unnecessary actions, could lead to serious and costly 
consequences. Thus, a quantitative reliability assessment for SPS is important and necessary. 
Using a single or point value for the parameter to evaluate the reliability of SPS might give very 
misleading results due to the uncertainty of reliability model and input data. The goal of the 
proposed project is to study the reliability of SPS and analyze the uncertainty effects of reliability 
for SPS. The exist SPSs of Taipower system are used as the target systems for SPS reliability 
assessment and uncertainty analysis. Research topics included in this project are: SPS reliability 
assessment (including fail to operate and nuisance trip), uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, 
and SPS reliability improvement analysis. In this year’s project, by incorporating an interval 
theory, a risk reduction worth importance concept, and a probabilistic risk-based index, a 
proposed procedure conducts parameter uncertainty analysis, identifies critical factors in the 
reliability model, performs risk assessments and determines a better option for the refinement of 
the studied SPS decision process logic module.

representing subjective judgments for uncertainty. 
In order to conceive an effective solution for system improvement, the identification of 
essential factors to the system reliability is required. There are well defined importance measures 
to accomplish this task, such as Fussel-Vesely or Birnbaum or risk reduction worth (RRW) 
measures. The essential factors could be the structure of the system or components that cause the 
variations in output. Sensitivity analysis can be employed to estimate the rate of change in the 
output of a model with respect to changes in model inputs. Such knowledge is important for 
(a) evaluating the applicability of the model, (b) determining parameters for which it is important 
to have more accurate values, and (c) understanding the behavior of the system being modeled 
[17]. 
A local event-based SPS was deployed by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) to 
accommodate an independent power producer (IPP) project [18] in 2003. Owing to the changes 
in operating practices, a design review of the SPS was conducted. It indicated that if the original 
logic is used and the component failure rates were higher than the original values, the reliability 
indices calculated would not have enough safety margins. This leads to a full review of the 
scheme and a system refinement study is conducted. This report presents the design refinement 
procedure and a probabilistic risk assessment method used in this study. It involves uncertainty 
and sensitivity analyses of relevant parameters and the choice of the SPS reliability enhancement 
options is made according to a minimum risk criterion. 
The organization of the report is as follows. In Section II the design refinement procedure and 
the SPS probabilistic risk assessment approach are described. Analytical methods for performing 
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are discussed. Section III shows some of the numerical 
results and Section IV gives relevant conclusions. 
 
II. SPS Refinement Procedure 
 
Fig. 1 shows the proposed procedure. Modification is required if the performance of SPS 
cannot meet the reliability requirement specification (RRS) or design review indicates that risk 
reduction is required. If this is the case, then sensitivity analysis is important for identifying the 
critical factors in the system. These are components, subsystems, and/or parameters within the 
design that are responsible for unacceptable reliability and/or risk. The last step in the SPS 
refinement is to adopt effective measures corresponding to each identified critical factors and 
continue until a satisfactory result is obtained. Possible reliability enhancement options include: 
- Using more reliable components, 
- Adding redundancy, 
- Changing system configuration or control logic, 
- Reducing test interval, and 
- Increasing diagnostic coverage and implementing defenses against common mode failure.

nuisance trip of an SPS. pfd(t) is the instantaneous probability of a component at time t that could 
cause an SPS failure of operation. pfdavg is the average probability of failing dangerous that 
indicates the probability of a component that could cause an SPS failure of operation. pfsavg is the 
average probability of failing safe that indicates the probability of a component that could cause 
an SPS to execute an unintended trip. PN is the probability of occurrence for the Nth cut-set; in 
the formula of Table I, it is assumed that m components (events) are involved. FN is the 
occurrence frequency of an Nth cut-set that has two basic events. Note that the contributions of 
components for cases with more than two basic events can be similarly calculated. ∆t is the time 
interval for FTA-AAL calculation, it can be an hour, a day or other proper time intervals. Q is the 
total discrete number of time steps in specified test interval, i.e., TI = ∆t × Q. 
 
B. Interval Theory 
Uncertainty may be categorized into two types, aleatory (having to do with chance) and 
epistemic uncertainties (having to do with knowledge). The aleatory aspect of uncertainty is that 
addressed when we characterize the events or phenomena being modeled as occurring in a 
‘random’, or ‘stochastic’ manner, and adopt probabilistic models to describe their occurrences. 
The epistemic uncertainty is that associated with the analyst’s confidence in the predictions of the 
studied model itself, and is a reflection of his assessment of how well his model represents the 
system he is modeling [20]. Epistemic uncertainties may be further divided into parameter 
uncertainties and model uncertainties. The former refers to uncertainty in the inputs and the latter 
refers to uncertainty in the verisimilitude of the underlying physical model [21]. In our study the 
parameter uncertainty is addressed. Utility’s recorded failure data and most modern reliability 
databases [22], [23] provide some indication of estimated uncertainty of component and/or 
system reliability. Uncertainty bounds convey the restrictions on the possible choices of 
reliability parameters arising from the observed life data [24] and different approaches can be 
used to model the uncertainties [13]-[16]. 
In many situations encountered by designers, it is often possible to locate the failure rates λ 
inside a closed interval [λmin, λmax], i.e., it is assumed to be unknown but bounded and without a 
probability structure. The objective of interval analysis is to estimate the bounds of the model 
output according to the bounds of the model inputs and parameters. The propagation of interval 
uncertainty is performed using interval arithmetic operations. If the logic operations of a system 
and the confidence intervals of variables, such as A = [amin , amax] and B = [bmin , bmax] are known 
and belong to R+ (positive real number), one can use the following formula to obtain the 
maximum and minimum of the operation results [15]. 
A(+)B=[amin + bmin , amax + bmax]       (1) 
A(–)B=[amin – bmax , amax – bmin]        (2) 
A(×)B=[amin × bmin , amax × bmax]        (3) 
A(÷)B=[amin ÷ bmax , amax ÷ bmin]        (4) 
An application of the interval analysis for calculating the reliability index of a generation 
rejection scheme (GRS) illustrated in [7] is demonstrated here. The system configuration and 
decision logics of the GRS are shown in Fig. 2. An outage of either of the two critical lines (line 
12-13 and line 13-23) shown in Fig. 2 will result in a plant-out-of-step condition. The GRS logic 
used in this scheme is that when there is a fault on either line, specific breakers open and send 
“open” signals to the OR gate. The output of OR gate together with the arming signal determine 
the outputs of the AND gates, which are the inputs to a two-out-of-three (2oo3) voting scheme. 
When there are two or more of the voting scheme inputs with high signals, the voting scheme will 
send signals to trip one generator. Fig. 3 is a fault tree of the reliability model.

Instead of using a single value (0.02095) to represent PFD, interval analysis result indicates 
that the PFD of this case is between 0.01024 and 0.03209. 
 
C. Risk Reduction Worth Importance Analysis 
Mathematical sensitivity analysis methods, such as Fussel-Vesely, Birnbaum, risk reduction 
worth (RRW) importance concept [17], nominal range sensitivity analysis, differential sensitivity 
analysis [26], and wide range method (WRM) [27], can be used to assess sensitivity of a model 
output to the range of variation of an input. When there is no mathematical model but statistical 
data between input and output are available, statistical sensitivity methods, such as correlation 
analysis, regression analysis [14], and classification and regression tree [28], can be employed to 
conduct the sensitivity analysis. Correlation analysis, measuring the strength of a linear 
relationship between an input (e.g., the failure rate of a component) and the output (e.g., the PFD), 
is useful for investigating whether it is the architecture design of an input represented by the 
reliability model or the uncertainty of the input data that causes the variation in output. If the 
correlation is strong (negative or positive), then it is more likely that the architecture design is the 
dominant factor. On the other hand, if the correlation is zero then the range of input parameters 
would be the dominant factor [8]. 
In this subsection, only the RRW importance concept is illustrated. The RRW index for a 
component i shown in (5) is a measure of the change in unreliability (unavailability) when its 
failure rate is set to zero (i.e. made perfect) while holding all other inputs at base-case values. 
This importance measure shows how much better the system can become when its components 
are improved.

For the case shown in Fig. 3, there are four components, one OR gate and three AND gates. As 
an example, when calculating the PFD for λAND_gate-1=0, outputs from Cutset_2 and Cutset_3 are 
zero, and Cutset_1 (0.0198) and Cutset_4 (3.92x10-4) have nonzero outputs. The RRW indices of 
the OR gate and any one of the AND gates for PFD evaluation in a one-year period are calculated 
as follows.

These results indicate that the PFD of the system is more sensitive to the failure rate of the OR 
gate than that of the AND gate. 
 
D. Probabilistic Risk Assessment 
Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) or probabilistic safety assessment approaches have been 
used since the 1960s in the aeronautics and defense industries. PRA is a comprehensive and 
systematic methodology to assess risks associated with a complex engineered technological entity, 
such as spacecrafts or nuclear power plants [11], [29]. A guide for PRA taking the epistemic 
uncertainty into account is available in [30]. Since SPS is designed to mitigate the consequences 
of abnormal conditions after severe contingencies, the risk of the system is contributed in parts by

Fig.5 shows the logic diagram of the SPS decision process in this study. When the power 
transfer from the IPP to the Dongshan E/S exceeds 900 MW, the SPS will be armed either 
through the manual transfer switch (43) initiated by an operator or automatically by an output 
contactor of the remote terminal unit (RTU). When a fault exists on Lines 1 and 2, the circuit 
breakers (CB) on these lines are opened; the four CB b-contactors (52b) energize the lockout 
relay (86) and result in tripping of the ATR at the Dongshan E/S or one of the Hoping IPP units. 
To simplify the analysis, the lockout relay tripping contactors (86a) are assumed fully reliable.

B. Reliability Evaluation Results 
The Dongshan-SPS fails to operate when any of the b-contactors of circuit breakers, lockout 
relay, or both 43-switch and RTU contacts are stuck open. Nuisance trips can be induced by all 
four CB b-contactors or when the lockout relays are stuck closed and accompanied by either a 
stuck-closed 43-switch or RTU contact. Fig. 6 and 7 show the fault trees for the PFD and STR 
evaluations. Because the observed life data of the components in the Dongshan-SPS are not 
available, data recorded by Taipower and those used in [8] and recommended in public reliability 
databases [22], [23] are used in the calculations. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) results 
and component failure rates used in this study are shown in Table II. 
 11
C. Uncertainty Analysis Results 
If [λmin, λmax] is known then it should be used. In this study, the component failure rates are 
assumed within an interval of [λ-1.96σ, λ+1.96σ] and σ=0.2λ. λs are those shown in Table II. The 
PFD intervals calculated by FTA-AAL technique with data uncertainty included are shown in 
Table III. It can be seen that the upper bounds of PFDavg and PFD exceed the RRS. 
For confirmation purpose, another statistical approach was used under the assumption that 
component failure rates are normally distributed N(λ,σ2). The results are shown in Fig. 8. The 
95% confidence level (CL) curve indicates that one could have 95% confidence that the PFD 
values would be lower than those shown on the line. It is confirmed by Fig. 8 that at the end of 
the studied period PFD could exceed the 0.15 limit set in the RRS.

D. Sensitivity Analysis Results 
Two cases were used to calculate RRW indices. In Case-1, data shown in Table II are used; 
while in Case-2, the results are computed by assigning all components with the same failure rate 
which is the average of the λs shown in Table II. RRW1 (Case-1) and RRW2 (Case-2) indices 
shown in Table IV indicate that CB-52b and 86-Ry are the most critical components to the PFD 
of the system. In Case-1, as λD52b varies from 0.03 per year to zero and holding all other λD at the 
base values, PFDavg will change from 0.06757 to 0.05351, i.e., the improvement factor is about 
1.263. Again, for confirmation purposes, correlation analysis using statistical sampling technique 
is also conducted and the results are included in Table IV. The methods tested have concluded 
that CB-52b plays a major role in system reliability.

As seen from Table V, in option 1-a, the PFDavg is lower due to the adoption of more reliable 
components but the STR shows no improvement. In option 1-b, the PFDavg has no further 
significant change while the STR has an observable reduction from 0.0046 to 0.0012. Study 
results have shown that STR is most sensitive to the failure rate of 86-Ry. Compared with option 
1-b, option 1-a is more cost-effective. Options 2 and 3 are also effective in reducing the PFD but 
would result in a slight increase in the STR. Fig. 11 shows the PFD trends during a one-year 
period. It can be seen that all the options evaluated meet the RRS even if the designated 
uncertainties are included.

quarterly inspection would then reduce all reliability indices. Fig. 12 shows that if the PFD(t) 
target is set to 0.05, then test interval should be less than 3206 hours, i.e., about four and a half 
months, and in this case the PFDavg is 0.02343 over a one-year period.

and sensitivity analyses. The failure rate for each component used in the reliability model could 
be obtained from: 1) field data or test data; 2) published databases, papers, handbooks, technical 
reports; and 3) experts’ opinions. These data are uncertain and this report suggests that in the 
reliability assessment, the data uncertainty issue should be considered in order to assure that the 
system performance is satisfactory with an acceptable safety margin. 
Since limited reliability data of Dongshan SPS components are available, data recorded for 
similar components in other Taipower protection systems and those shown in [22] and [23] were 
adopted to derive the intervals of parameter uncertainties used in this study. In practice, the 
parameter uncertainties of the component failure rates could be based on data from the 
manufacturers, and then updated according to the actual operational experiences and using the 
Bayes' Theorem [21], [31]. 
There are many tools, such as SAPHIRE (IRRAS), CAFTA and RISKMAN, that can be used 
for reliability assessment including uncertainty analysis, however, due to the use of interval 
arithmetic for taking care of uncertainty, the FTA-AAL calculation and the risk assessment 
approach proposed in this report, it was decided that, instead of using the above mentioned tools, 
the software package implemented by the authors are used to study the design refinement 
alternatives. Those tools can later be used for comparing the analysis results 
It is suggested that a few sensitivity analysis methods should be employed to avoid misleading 
results. As shown in Fig. 9, WRM is a good supplement to the RRW approach since it studies a 
wider range of failure rates and their sensitivities. Furthermore, correlation analysis can be 
employed to investigate whether it is the structure design or the range of data for a particular 
input parameter that causes the variation in output. In system refinement, choosing duplication to 
improve the dependability of the studied SPS is usually accompanied with a decrease in security. 
Thus, the relative effects of a failure to operate and an unintended operation must be carefully 
assessed. 
 
V. Conclusion 
 
In electric power networks, system protection schemes (SPS) applications are becoming more 
widespread owing to various environmental, financial, and other difficulties in constructing 
alternatives. One of the main concerns in SPS deployment is to ensure that the function is reliably 
performed when needed as designed and to avoid unnecessary operations when it is not needed. 
This report elucidates the importance of developing a systemic reliability framework and risk 
assessment for SPS and highlights the effects of parameter uncertainty in the reliability model 
and risks of fail to operate and nuisance trip of SPS. A method for assessing the probabilistic risk 
of an SPS application is presented. A general procedure for SPS refinement that incorporates 
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses and the risk assessment technique is proposed. Study results 
have shown that fault tree analysis (FTA) is flexible for modeling various protection structures 
and handling data uncertainties. If high quality data are not available, uncertainty bounds are 
useful for representing subjective judgments for uncertainty of reliability parameters. To meet the 
reliability requirement, risk reduction worth (RRW) importance concept and other sensitivity 
analysis methods can be employed for effective improvement of the protection scheme. The 
proposed procedure can be used to perform quantitative analyses of SPS reliability and conceive 
better solution when modification is required.
