the concept with chord progression for computer accompaniment. However, music is 
a subjective art, there are no absolute standards to determine whether it is good or not. 
To solve this phenomenon, the interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) is proposed 
[9][10].  
We present a system using the variable-length genetic algorithm with interactive 
mechanism to develop the computer accompaniment with different styles[11]. The 
connection of chords, the emotion, and the rhyme are our main purposes to improve 
the music accompaniment with different demands. 
 
三、研究方法與成果 
In our approach, we adopt the variable length GA to make style music 
accompaniment. In the chromosome representation, we focus on three important parts 
drum, chord and melody. The chromosome structure is designed based on these 
concepts. 
 
Figure 1. Chromosome representation 
 
The notation of drum part are 0(upbeat) and 1(downbeat); the notation of chord 
part are 0(none)、1、♭2、2、♭3、3、4、♭5、5、♭6、6、♭7 and 7; the notation of melody 
part are -1(hold)、0(pause)、1、♭2、2、♭3、3、4、♭5、5、♭6、6、♭7 and 7. 
Initialization: with the notations of three parts, user generates favorite melodies, 
rhyme style as input. The drum part fits the rhyme patterns, and the chord part refers 
to the note of corresponding melody part for initializing.  
Evaluation: the evaluation process checks the string matching problem between 
chromosomes and the progression rules from the music theory and the progression 
rules selected by the user. The evaluation process also checks the emotion of music 
from sad to happy. As mentioned above, the factors P and E are used for user 
evaluation. 
 The chord progression factor P we use to evaluate the chromosomes in chord 
part is as follows. 
 
1. Let a1a2…ai…am be the string contains different chords in the chromosome for   
max

6. Repeat 1 to 5 until all of the P factors in the population are evaluated. 
 
    |chord|, |chord major|, and |chord minor| represent total number of chords, major 
chords in the chromosome, and minor chords in the chromosome. 
 
Emotion factor E checking process: 
1. The emotion parameter is selected by the user from adjusting the mood. Ten 
degrees are used from 0.0 to 1.0 to express the mood expression of sad to happy. 
2. If the emotion parameter is the same or more than 0.5, we calculate the ratio of 
major chords  in the chromosome. If the emotion parameter is less than 0.5, we 
calculate the ratio of minor chords in the chromosome.

3. Normalize the E factor. The emotion factor is normalized to 1.

4. Repeat 1 to 3 until all of the E factors in the population are evaluated. 
 
Chromosomes will be evaluate with objective function 
Maximize (w1Pnormalization+w2Enormalization) where wi , i = 1, 2, are the weighting 
value. 
Selection: We adopt the optimal preservation strategy and select the amount of 
initial population chromosomes in rank for the next operations. 
Crossover: The method we adopt is a single point crossover which decided 
according to the v(ai) calculated by the evaluation process. The v(ai) is the key point 
to show whether it is a smooth transition for consecutive chords.  
Mutation: The mutation mechanism is designed for chord part. It is possible for 
chromosomes to perform mutation with 0.2 probabilities. Mutation will occur in the 
position of a new chord among the chord sequence in a chromosome.
