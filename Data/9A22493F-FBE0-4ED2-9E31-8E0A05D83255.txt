I. SYSTEM MODEL 
In this project, the reverse link is considered. Denote K as 
the number of active mobile users and M is the number of 
antenna elements at the base station. All users share N 
subcarriers for spreading in the frequency domain. By 
adopting the channel model in [5], the MC-CDMA signal 
received at the output of an antenna array in the l-th bit 
interval can be expressed as

We assume that all the users are synchronous. Note that some 
timing synchronization techniques (e.g. [12]) may be used to 
achieve a quasi-synchronous condition. The output of the 
FFT operation for the m-th antenna element is an N×1 vector

covariance matrix obtained by despreading the signals  with 
the k-th user code [5]. Then, the information of the array 
response is employed in the first processing unit in the 
concatenated 1-D processing block diagram. Note that there 
are two different processing orders in the proposed 
concatenated 1-D processing schemes, named “code-space” 
processing and “space-code” processing. By reconstructing

By taking the code-space processing scheme as an example, 
we feed it into the first MSWF receiver column by column, 
and set ( ) /1 k k k k=V H c H c  for the k-th user. Then there are 
M scalar output data which are stacked to form an M×1 
vector. We fed it into the second GSC MSWF again and set 
1 k kV = a / a . The output of the second GSC MSWF is the 
decision variable ˆ ( )kd l . Similarly, the concatenated 1-D 
“space-code” receiver can also be formulated by exchanging   
the processing order of the GSC MSWF in the code-space 
processing scheme. An efficient linear time implementation 
of MSWF can be found in [13]. This makes the proposed 
structure feasible for the practical application.  
 
 
 
IV. TWO-BRANCH PROCESSING STRUCTURE WITH 
THE CONCATENATED 1-D   REDUCED-RANK 
PROCESSING
 
 
Fig. 3. Two-branch processing structure with the concatenated 1-D reduced-
rank processing scheme. 
 
In the concatenated 1-D processing structure, we can observe 
that the output of the upper processing branch, i.e. the output 
of 1V , is equivalent to the maximum ratio combine (MRC) 
operation. It is known that MRC operation is the optimum 
combination scheme in AWGN.  Although the GSC 
processing structures with the MSWF reduced rank 
processing perform better than MRC asymptotically in 
interference environments, the parameters involved in the 
proposed scheme with the MSWF reduced rank processing 
require estimation with a finite number of samples practically. 
If the number of the samples within coherence time is not 
large enough in fast fading channels, these parameters may 
not be accurate and would degrade its performance severely. 
Therefore, we propose a new concatenated 1-D processing 
structure with slightly extra computational cost, and it can 
outperform the original concatenated 1-D processing 
structure with a SIC receiver. Figure 3 shows the modified 
concatenated 1-D processing structure. It is similar to the 
processing structure presented in the preceding section. The 
difference between them is that we keep the output signals in 
the upper processing branch. We also define 1 1sgn( )d y=  in 
the upper processing branch. After the processing, there are 
two outputs from the two branches: one is the output signal 
of the MRC operation, and the other one is the output signal 
of the original concatenated 1-D processing scheme. The 
processing branch i with the smaller statistics is selected to 
generate the final decision variable. The selection operation 
is expressed as

V. SIMULATION RESULTS 
We present the simulation results to show superior 
performance with the proposed concatenated 1-D reduced-
rank processing schemes. The code employed in the 
simulation is the Hadamard-Wash code with length of N=32. 
There are three multipaths with the same average power for 
each user, and the maximum delay spread is five sampling 
intervals. The modulation is BPSK.  There are ten users and 
the angles of arrival are randomly generated. A linear array 
of four antenna elements is employed with half-wavelength 
spacing. Both equal power and unequal power scenarios are

scenarios of multi-cell OFDM systems due to different 
characteristics of interference power among cells. We 
consider a cellular OFDM system under CCI, where the 
resource assignment is performed to satisfy the user 
individual bit error rate (BER) and data rate requirements 
to minimize the total transmit power of base stations within 
the systems. Therefore, we propose the interlaced iterative 
bit and power allocation algorithm based on the expression 
of the bit and power relationship derived by using a 
Lagrangian method. Without making an approximation as 
the manner in [5], we utilize an interlaced iteration to 
perform bit and power update alternatively until 
convergence. These converged continuous bit values are 
passed to the proportional distribution and the rounding 
compensation two processes to obtain the final total 
transmit power and bit allocation while satisfying each 
user’s required data rate and symbol error rate in the 
downlink multi-cell OFDM system. A radio network 
controller (RNC) allocates bit and power to all sub-carriers 
for each user with the knowledge of the channel gains 
among all user and base station pairs. We assume an 
existing channel estimation scheme and signaling structure 
to obtain the information in the cellular systems under 
considerations [13]. For the multi-cell OFDM systems, our 
main contribution is to propose a novel bit and power 
allocation scheme with comparable performance of the 
existing multi-user greedy method for interference 
channels, but the computational complexity is greatly 
reduced.  
 
2.  System Model and Problem Formulation 
 
Suppose we have a downlink multi-cell OFDM-based 
wireless network with M  co-channel cells, and each cell 
consists of a user distributed randomly to communicate 
with the associated base station. The available bandwidth 
of each user is partitioned into cN  narrowband OFDM 
sub-carriers. The other mobiles in a given cell may use 
time division multiple access (TDMA) as a multiple access 
scheme to share the spectrum. Each BS has the maximum 
constrained transmit power to communicate with the user 
within the cell, and the user has its required data rate iR  in 
cell i . Besides, the average symbol error rate ep  must be 
ensured at a certain level to meet each user’s service 
quality. 
The M  BSs are connected to a radio network 
controller which controls the radio resource management. 
The RNC determines the number of bits )(nbi and the 
transmit power )(nPi  according to the user’s data rate and 
channel condition on sub-carrier n  in cell i . )(, nH ij , 
{ }Mji ,...,2,1 , ∈  and { }cNn ,...,2,1∈ , is the squared 
absolute value of a complex channel gain between BS j  
and the user in cell i  on sub-carrier n . )(nNi  is the 
power of the thermal noise on sub-carrier n  of the user in 
cell i . Figure 1 displays a simple model of three 
co-channel cells. The solid lines, the dotted lines, and the 
curving arrows present the target signals, the interfering 
signals, and the thermal noise, respectively. As the 
diagram indicates, user 3 in the rd3 cell receives the 
desired signal with power )()( 33,3 nPnH ⋅ , the two 
interfering signals with power )()( 13,1 nPnH ⋅  plus 
)()( 23,2 nPnH ⋅ , and the thermal noise power ).(3 nN

allocation problem. Further, we assume that timing and 
frequency synchronization for each user is perfect. The 
bandwidth of each sub-carrier is chosen to be sufficiently 
smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel in 
order to overcome frequency selectivity. The guard time of 
each OFDM symbol is longer enough than the maximum 
excess delay.  
The received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio

characteristics and strength of interference power among 
cells with frequency reuse. Furthermore, the derived 
equations here without the approximation can not be 
solved directly and we propose the interlaced iteration 
method to solve the problem. During the iteration 
operation, whenever we have a new bit assignment of all 
users set by using Equation (13), the desired user power 
and the interfering power have to be updated accordingly. 
Even without the constraints in Eqation (3), there exists the 
relationship of assigned bits and powe in interference 
channels which is required to be satisfied [3,14]. 
Following the property and referring to Equations (1) and 
(5), and denoting the required SINR as ))(( nbiiγ  given a 
particular require symbol error rate, we have the  matrix

From Equation (14), we have the power solution as the

This provides the required bit and power relationship to be 
satisfied for a particular subcarrier n under the interference 
channel. These power solutions can be utilized to replace 
all users’ sub-carriers target power and interfering power 
in Equation (13) given a particular bit loading. All of these 
updated power is mapped into another new bit allocation in 
Equation (13) for the new iteration. The iterative 
operations continue in the interlaced manner   until 
{ } { }{ ( ) ,  1,..., ,  1,..., }i cb n i M n N∈ ∈  converge. 
Initially, we set all {{ [ ]}iI n } to zeros. Since our bit and 
power allocation process involves in alternating the 
operations of the bit evaluation and the power update, we 
called the proposed scheme as the “interlaced iterative” 
allocation algorithm in the paper. 
Based on the final result of converged bit assignments, 
we perform the other two steps for the proposed bit and 
power allocation algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm is 
comprised of three steps as the flow chart illustrated in Fig. 
2. First, we employ Equations (13) and (16) to obtain the 
initial “relaxed” solution of the bit loading in the interlaced 
iterative manner for all co-channel users’ sub-carriers. 
Then, the algorithm is followed by the “Proportional 
Distribution” and the “Rounding Compensation” two steps. 
Referring to Fig. 2, each step is explained briefly as 
follows: 
 
Fig. 2.   Flow chart of the proposed allocation algorithm. 
 
1) Step I – interlaced iteration  
To compute the bit allocation matrix b-table in 
cNM × dimensions, the th-),( ni entry stores the 
number of allocated bits for the co-channel user in cell i  
on the th-n sub-carrier. The superscript (s) denotes the 
iteration number. We evaluate all entries in the table by 
using Equation (13) and update 1)(stable-b + using the 
values in (s)table-b to calculate Equation (16) to update 
the term of power in the interlaced iterative fashion until 
all components of (s)table-b converges, which is

As indicated in equation (7), the correlation matrix 
must be obtained before we calculate the beamforming 
vector. Using equation (8) to evaluate cbR  is feasible for a 
centralized method.  In this paper, we would like to 
develop a distributed algorithm for joint bit and power 
allocation with adaptive beamforming, so equation (8) is 
rewritten into another form for the purpose in the 
derivation of the distributed scheme. Obviously, the 
correlation matrix is related to the noise power and the 
received signal power transmitted by other non-desired 
mobiles. We can calculate the autocorrelation of received 
signal vector from all mobiles, and then subtract the 
correlation matrix from the desired mobile as indicated in 
equation (9):

By this way, we only need to know the transmit power and 
the channel gain of the desired mobile in the desired cell.

3.  Adaptive Allocation Algorithm 
 
The allocation problem under consideration is to 
minimize the total transmit power of all mobiles with the 
required data rate iB  and the BER eP  constraint of mobile 
i. We also preset the maximum transmit power maxP where 
one mobile can support. The modulation mode can be 
chosen among: {no transmission, QPSK, 16-QAM, 
64-QAM}, and this corresponds to transmitting the 
number of bits cbb ∈{0, 2, 4, 6}. The allocation problem 
can be formulated as

Our goal is to find the assignment of bit and power. 
In other words, we have to find cbP associated with 
c
bb  for 
every mobile and every subcarrier to minimize the total 
transmit power in the interference channel. However, this 
is an NP-hardness problem, so it is impractical to try out all 
possible combinations to choose the best one if we aim for 
the real-time application. For this reason, we propose 
effective suboptimal methods to solve this problem as will 
 (7) to combine received signals. ( )b tc is calculated 
and all elements in ba  are set equal ones. 
Step2: The integer constraint of bit allocation and the 
maximum transmit power constraint are relaxed. 
Then, we use the Lagrangian algorithm to solve 
this minimum power problem and get the 
continuous solution ( 1)cbb t + for all subcarriers, 
0, , 1c N∈ −" , as in Procedure I. In this 
Lagrangian operation, we keep the estimated 
interference power caused by other non-desired 
mobiles to be a constant during the computation of 
the current scheduling time.

0, , 1c N∈ −" , then we go to step 4, otherwise, we 
perform Procedure II and go back to step 2. In this 
step, we adopt the method described in [8] to solve 
this similar problem. 
Step4:  The maximum transmit power constraint is ensured 
in the following operations. ( 1)cbb t + and ( )b tc  
are used to calculate the power allocation 
( 1)cbP t + by equation (14) for all subcarriers. If

Step5: If the minimum power solution in step 4 can not 
satisfy the maximum power constraint, we 
decrease the requested data rate to satisfy the 
power constraint under the requisite BER. We reset 
all elements in ba  to be ones. Then, use the 
Lagrangian algorithm to solve the maximum data 
rate which can be offered, and get new ( 1)cbb t +  
for all subcarriers, 0, , 1c N∈ −" , as in Procedure 
III. It is similar to step 2, where we also treat other 
cell interference power as a constant parameter in 
the Lagrangian operation. The derivation of the 
Lagrange operations which maximizes mobile b 
throughput is quite similar. 
Step6: After step 5, we also add the constraint of bits 
within the range of max[0, ]b . If the bit allocation 
satisfies max0 ( 1)
c
bb t b≤ + ≤  for all subcarriers, 
0, , 1c N∈ −" ,  then we go to step 7; or else we 
apply some actions as in Procedure Ⅳ [8] and go 
back to step 5. 
Step7: We quantize ( 1)cbb t + for all subcarriers, 
0, , 1c N∈ −" , in this step. We first truncate the 
bit elements to the nearest even integers less than 
itself. Then we sort the incremental powers of 
adding two bits over all subcarriers. We choose the 
smaller ones to add bits to satisfy the data rate or 
the maximum power constraints. This is stated as in 
Procedure V. We use equation (14) again to obtain 
the final power allocation ( 1)cbP t +  for all 
subcarriers, 0, , 1c N∈ −" .

4.  Simulation Results 
 
In this section, we present the simulation results to 
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed distributed 
allocation algorithm. We compare the performance of our 
proposed distributed algorithm with those of the 
centralized algorithm and the fixed allocation method, 
which is similar to the method in [4]. We adopt two 
co-channel tiers to represent the most influence of infinite 
tiers of co-channel interference [9]. Hence, in our 
simulations, we use a hexagonal cellular network 
consisting of 19 base stations located at the center of each 
co-channel cell and each base station is communicating 
with a mobile. The frequency reuse factor is 4.  We use the 
method of wrapping around to let all cells have 6 
co-channel cells in the first co-channel tier and 12 
co-channel cells in the second tier. The mobiles are 
randomly distributed with uniform distribution within each 
cell and the radius of each cell is 1000 m. The path loss 
gain is -78.3 dB at the reference distance of 50 m and no 
mobile is generated to be located within the reference 
distance. The path loss exponent is set to 3.5 and the 
standard deviation of lognormal shadowing fading is 7 dB. 
The maximum transmit power for one mobile is 30 dBm. 
The multi-path model is assumed to follow COST207 
typical urban 6-ray channel model [10]. There are 32

Based on the above observations, we can view the 
equivalent channels ];;[ mknheqv  of all subcarriers 
as the channel coefficients for the individual user in 
MIMO OFDM-based multiuser systems.  
Our purpose here is to optimize performance for the 
multiuser MIMO-OFDM system displayed in Fig 1. 
Suppose that CSIs of each user are estimated perfectly at 
the receiver and feedback to the base station without 
errors. Then, we want to minimize the overall transmit 
power subject to BER performance requirment on each 
subcarrier, while maintaining a required bit rate for each 
user.  
Every space-time coded block conveys two symbols 
];;[1 mkns  and ];;[2 mkns  and there are ];;[2 mknb⋅  bits of informations on the k th 
subcarrier per each block.  We neglect the block index 
n  for the simplicity of notations. For the multiuser 
MIMO-OFDM systems under consideration, we do not 
allow more than one user to share a subcarrier. Therefore, 
variable mk ,ρ  with value 1 or 0, is used to indicate 
whether the k th subcarrier is employed by the m th 
user or not. Let the users’ data rates { }mRRR ,.....,, 21  
be the predetermined parameters, and the bit error rate 
must be ensured at a certain level to meet the service 
quality. Our objective then can be formulated as the 
following constrained optimization problems:

Where ];[ mkP  is the power allocation to the m th 
user’s k th subcarrier and totalP  is the total power 
available to the transmitter per block; kBER  denotes 
the instantaneous BER of the k th subcarrier and 0BER  
fading channels. We assume that the fading is quasi-static. 
i.e., it remains constant during the transmission of a frame 
(several of STBC blocks) and it changes from a frame 
(duration is 10ms) to another. The entire transmit 
bandwidth, 20MHz, includes 48 data subcarriers. The 
modulation modes for subcarriers used in the simulation 
are no transmission, BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM. 
The number of users is 3, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. The 
largest path losses difference among users is 0, 5, 10, 15, 
20, 25, 30, and 35dB due to different locations. The 
targeted BER is set to 410− . 
Our adaptive allocation is performed on a per frame 
basis. The scalar equivalent channel, with 
input );;( mkns j  and output );;( mknz j , as described 
by (4) is estimated perfectly at the start of the transmit 
frame. A total allowed transmission data rate of 
Mbps48  is set, and each user’s request data rate is 
assumed to be the same. The average SNRs of the 
received signal for all users are varied due to the various 
path losses at the different locations. A switching 
threshold is defined as the minimum required SNR for a 
given modulation mode to operate at a given targeted 
BER. Referring to (3), the realization of ];;[ mknheqv  
for detecting ];;[ mkns j  is in the circumstance of the 
AWGN for quasi-static channels.  In our simulation, we 
adopt the nominal switching thresholds of modulation 
modes (here, BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM): 8.4, 
11.4, 18.5, and 24.8 dB, respectively. The performance 
trend would be quite the same when the diversity gains 
are involved in the MIMO transmit scheme with fading 
channels. The switching levels of different modulation 
modes will be further investigated when the diversity 
gains are involved in the MIMO transmit scheme. 
  For the sake of simplicity, the MIMO system with 
2=tN  and 1=rN  is simulated. The performance of 
the developed scheme is compared with those of the 
“pure” CIA and WSA schemes. By setting the transmit 
power of FDMA-OFDM scheme in a 3 user situation as 
the performance reference, Figures 2 to 3 show the 
relative transmit power for various path losses difference 
among users (herein, 0 and 30 dB, respectively). It is 
indicated that the DCA-EXT scheme outperforms FDMA, 
CIA and WSA schemes. Figure 4 to 5 exhibit the transmit 
power performance gains of the DCA-EXT scheme which 
is compared with the WSA and FDMA, respectively, by 
varying the different numbers of users versus the path 
losses difference. Figure 4 shows that the power gains of 
the DCA-EXT scheme increase as the path losses 
difference becomes greater; the gain also increases while 
the number of the users increases.   
  On the other hand, we apply the DBA algorithm to the 
assigned subcarriers for each user after the iteration step 
of the DCA-EXT algorithm. In Figure 6, it reveals that 
the DCA-EXT scheme is very efficient. Therefore, the 
DBA step can be skipped without significant degradation 
in performance. 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we develop a downlink adaptive 
multiuser MIMO-OFDM transmit scheme with three 
adaptations: adaptive subcarrier allocation among users, 
adaptive modulation modes through OFDM subcarriers, 
and adaptive power allocation for each user’s subcarriers. 
The simulation results show that our presented scheme 
provides better performance than single user MIMO 
OFDM systems as the performance gain increases as the 
increment of users, and it also outperforms the 
FDMA-OFDM assignment under various situations, 
especially when the SNR differences of users are 
significant.
