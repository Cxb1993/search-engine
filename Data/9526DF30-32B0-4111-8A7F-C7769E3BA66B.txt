1. Introduction: Background and 
Rationale  
1.1 Introduction to Mobile Search  
Mobile Search is one of the next significant 
value creation opportunities for mobile 
operators around the world. This emerging 
ecosystem will greatly enhance the way 
people discover and purchase mobile 
content, physical goods, and local services. 
Mobile search revenues will surpass Internet 
search revenues as 1) mobile devices are 
always on, always available; 2) call 
completion connects consumers with 
marketers; and 3) mobile search couples 
subscriber profiles with immediate purchase 
intention as indicated by search activity.  
Searching on mobile devices follows in the 
footsteps of two significant wireless industry 
breakthroughs: SMS, which changed the 
way people communicate, and ringtones, 
which changed the way people think about 
personalizing their phone. Although online 
veterans like Google, Yahoo, Amazon and 
eBay proved the Internet to be an extremely 
efficient sales and marketing channel, the 
mobile Internet is just beginning to 
demonstrate its potential. With nearly 2 
billion global mobile device users, poised to 
be the primary means of accessing 
information, mobile economies are expected 
to eclipse Internet economies 
( http://www.emarketer.com/).  
Just as computer-based Web search has been 
a gateway to increased data consumption, 
mobile search will help meet the growing 
user demands for anytime, anywhere data 
access. With 81 percent of the US 
population, or 243.4 million people, 
subscribing to cell-phone service in 2006 
(http://ctia.org/media/industry_info/index.cf
m/AID/%2010323), the potential impact of 
wireless applications is enormous. 
Understanding the unique needs of mobile 
search will help improve the user experience 
and increase the service’s usage.  
1.2 How is Mobile Search Different from 
Internet Search?  
Internet users seek information for their term 
paper, their company’s competition, or 
prices for flights and mortgages. Today, 
mobile subscribers are looking for ringtones, 
downloadable music, and video clips, and at 
times, they use their phones to find a cool 
bar, the phone number of a nearby hotel, the 
capital of Armenia or the score of the 
Nuggets game. In the near term, however, 
the MMA expects internet searches to cover 
a broader territory of possible searches, 
while mobile searches, either by design or 
by user demonstrated usage, will be more 
mobile specific. 
(http://www.mmaglobal.com/)  
Despite the tendency to view mobile phones 
and mobile search as simply targeted at the 
 6
A typical search session from a mobile or 
wired device consists of: (1) formulating and 
entering the query, (2) browsing the search 
results, and (3) viewing selected result page. 
A state diagram, Figure 1, is used to 
illustrate the three steps in a search session. 
Analysis of search data from a large US 
carrier showed that cell-phone subscribers 
are typing longer queries in less time and 
clicking on more results (Kamvar & Baluja, 
2007). Our work aims to investigate and 
provide a user-centered interface for mobile 
search in the process of search session. 
Search for stock information and weather 
information is common in Internet search, 
however, Mobile phones have tiny screens 
with limited real estate. Is it significantly 
different from PCs accessing Internet when 
the presentation of query results is shown on 
the smaller screen?  
2.2 Usability Evaluation  
The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) defines usability of a 
product as “the extent to which the product 
can be used by specified users to achieve 
specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, 
and satisfaction in a specified context of 
use.” Usability has five attributes: 
learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, 
and user satisfaction (Nielsen, 2005; Nivala, 
et al., 2003; Norman, et al., 1998; 
Shneiderman, 1998). Depending on the type 
of application one attribute might be more 
critical than another. For example, if the 
software will be used infrequently then it is 
essential that users can easily remember the 
actions necessary for desired tasks. If the 
application is time critical then efficiency 
will be critical along with the prevention of 
errors. 
Usability engineering is the discipline that 
provides structured methods for achieving 
usability in user interface design during 
product development. Usability evaluation is 
part of this process. While theoretically any 
software product could be evaluated for 
usability, the evaluation is unlikely to 
produce good results unless a usability 
engineering process has been followed. 
Usability engineering has three basic phases: 
requirements analysis, 
design/testing/development, and installation. 
Usability goals are established during 
requirements analysis. Iterative testing is 
done during the design/testing/development 
phases and the results are compared to the 
usability goals. User feedback should also 
be obtained after installation as a check on 
the usability and functionality of the 
product.  
 
Figure 1 Search-session process. A state 
diagram illustrates the three steps in a search 
session.  
In this study, user-centered evaluations are 
accomplished by identifying representative 
users, representative tasks, and developing a 
procedure for capturing the problems that 
users have in trying to apply a particular 
software product in accomplishing these 
tasks. A model of the human information 
processor has been developed based on data 
derived from psychology research on the 
human systems of perception, cognition, and 
memory. The model incorporated 
capabilities of short term and long term 
memory, along with capabilities of the 
human visual and audio processing. Times

3.2.3 Experimental Design 
Visual performance and visual fatigue of 
interactive E-map will be evaluated using 
L16 (215) orthogonal array experiment. The 
effects of design factors including image 
size (Large-- 486×326 pixels, 
Small--231×331 pixels), type (E-map/ 
E-map plus satellite (E+S-map for short), 
illustrated in Figure 2), direction key 
(Yes/No, illustrated in Figure 3), and 
hierarchical zoom key (Yes/No, illustrated 
in Figure 4) on the simulated interface of 
interactive Electronic map would be 
investigated. Response variables consist of 
visual performance, visual fatigue (Chi and 
Lin, 1998; Weber, et al., 1975) and 
subjective workload based on NASA-TLX 
task load index) (Hart and Staveland, 1998).

4. Results 
4.1 Analysis of Preference-based 
Experiment 
The results of QUIS indicate that users 
prefer electronic map to satellite map and 
most users use satellite map only in familiar 
places. In addition, not all the icons used in 
the Electronic map can be perfectly 
identified. There are significant associations 
between gender and icon recognition. 
For the comparisons of subjective 
preference, test results of mid P-values 
(Agresti, 2007) indicate that the proportions 
between like and dislike the design of 
direction key, hierarchical zoom key, and 
route planning are not equal and shown in 
Table 1. It indicates the proportion 
preferring using mouse is significantly 
higher than ones with using direction key 
(mid P-value=0.00024). It also indicates the 
proportion preferring using hierarchical 
zoom key is significantly higher than ones 
without using hierarchical zoom key (mid 
P-value=0.0013). In addition, the proportion 
preferring using route planning supported by 
Google Maps is significantly higher than 
ones without route planning (mid

time for distance-identifying task 
4.2.2 Analysis of Visual Fatigue 
The summary of difference between critical 
fusion frequency after experiment (CFFA) 
and CFF before experiment (CFFB) for 
distance-identifying task is listed in Table 4. 
It indicates the mean DCFF of E+S-map is 
smaller than the one of E-map, that is, there 
is more visual fatigue using E+S-map than 
using E-map. In addition, it looks like more 
visual fatigue using direction key than 
without using direction key. 
Table 4 Descriptive Statistics of DCFF for 
distance-identifying task 
The analysis of variance and the 
contributions of each design factor for 
DCFF are shown in Table 5. It indicates that 
there are 39.9%, 38.16%, and 12.6% of 
SSTO explained in the order of rank by the 
main effects of Type (T) and Direction 
key(D), and three-factor interaction effect of 
Size, Type, and Zoom (S×T×Z). There is 
90.66% of total variance attributing to the 
factors mentioned above. Based on the 
model-selection criteria of the larger 
determination coefficient ( 2R ) the better, the 
larger adjusted determination coefficient 
( 2adjR ) the better, and the smaller Akaike’s 
information criterion ( pAIC ) the better,  
the best fitting model satisfying the 
assumption that the data coming from the 
normal distribution with using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is: 
    
DTDTDCFF ×−−+−= 4023.00152.04675.29.1µˆ (1) 
                                                 
The results of model fitting indicate that 
the interaction effect of map type and 
direction key affect the visual fatigue 
statistically significant. In Figure 6, the 
worst case for visual fatigue is the 
combination of E+S-map and using 
direction key which has the lowest mean 
DCFF (-3.92). The best case for visual 
fatigue is the combination of E-map and 
without using direction key which has the 
lowest mean DCFF (0.57). In average, 
E-map and without using direction key 
could avoid the visual degradation.

Instructions for Using the Author Template  
SV-lncs 
Preliminaries 
The author template has been designed for authors preparing manuscripts for the series 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science for Springer-Verlag. The template supports the 
programs Winword 7 (Win 95), 97, 2000, and Word for Macintosh. Predefined style 
formats are available for all the necessary structures to be included in the manuscript, 
and these formats can be quickly accessed using keystroke combinations or the special 
toolbars provided. 
• If you are working on a PC using Windows, copy the file SV-lncs.dot into the direc-
tory containing your Word templates. (Start Word and choose Tools – Options to see 
where the template should be saved.) 
• If you are using a Macintosh, first open Word an choose File Open and the file type 
"Templates". Open the file SV-lncs.dot, choose Save as, and save the file under the 
name SV-lncs (without the extension ".dot") in your template folder. This will usu-
ally be Programs\Word\Templates. 
Setting Up the Template
