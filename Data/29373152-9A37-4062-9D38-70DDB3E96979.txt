Abstract
If the oral cavity tumor can be found and treated in early days, we can improve cure rate of 
patient. So diagnosing disease early is most important to treat cancer. Bioelectrical impedance 
Spectroscopy (BIS) is a technology to apply bio-impedance measurement. There are some 
advantages including inexpensive- ness, non-radioactive injury and easily operating. The method has 
been used in many medical inspection researches. Some investigators try to regard the method as the 
clinical diagnostic tool. In this paper, we apply this technology to measure oral tumor tissue. The 
normal location and tumor location within tissue sample are measured respectively. The results can 
be clearly showed differences between both. By the method of bioelectrical impedance characteristic 
parameter, we found lower impedance in tumor tissue than normal tissue. When we apply lower 
frequency to tissue, difference between both is obvious. Then by ROC analysis, our research results 
show the method owns high sensitivity and specificity.  
Keywords: Bioelectrical impedance Spectroscopy (BIS), Electrical impedance, Oral cavity 
tumor

Verifying of the Multi-Frequency Current Source for Electrical Impedance Tomography 695
_________________________________________   IFMBE Proceedings Vol. 21  ___________________________________________
of op-amp circuit types, the resistance of R4b can be used to 
control output current. Assume that the R4b resistance is 
1kȍ, the output current of Iout is equal to 1mA. 
The traditional Howland current generator mainly con-
sists of one op-amp chip. Because of this circuit is quite 
wasteful in terms of power, the advance Howland is imple-
mented. Here the advance Howland circuit showed in Fig. 2 
is used as VCCS. Moreover, the circuit employs both nega-
tive feedback, via R2 and positive feedback, via R4a. Ac-
cording to equation 1, the series resistance R4a+R4b must 
satisfy the balanced bridge condition with the other resis-
tors. The output current is derived from the node at which 
the resistors meet. By equation 2, its current also is deter-
mined primarily by R4b. Then R4b can be made as small as 
desired to keep the other resistances high for conserving 
power. Equation 3 expresses the output impedance of the 
circuit. If the resistors satisfy the balance bridge condition, 
ideally the output impedance is infinite, as required for true 
current source behavior.  
For an unbalance bridge means unequal resistance ratios, 
we can express the equation 4. TheH represents the frac-
tional difference between the two ratios, then by substitut-
ing and simplifying the output impedance can be obtained 
in equation 5.

Further, VCCS also consists of two op-amps. In this 
dual-op-amp circuit type, one op-amp inserted between R4a
and R4b is used as voltage buffer. The circuit employs posi-
tive feedback, via one op-amp and R4a. So the balanced 
bridge condition represented in equation 6 can be satisfied. 
Primarily R4b in equation 7 also determines the output cur-
rent. Equation 8 indicates the output impedance. If the resis-
tors satisfy the balanced bridge condition, we can achieve 
that the output impedance equal to be infinite. If not, the 
output impedance is essentially the same as for the one-op-
amp circuit type.

For three-op-amp type, the VCCS consists of three op-
amps shown in Fig. 3. Except one op-amp used as voltage 
buffer, the invert amplifier is inserted between R3 and buffer 
op-amp. Then, the negative feedback via invert amplifier is 
added to input signal of Vin. If the balanced bridge condition 
represented in equation 9 is satisfied and the feedback path 
is ideal, the output current is in equation 10. The output 
impedance of this circuit is given by equation 11. Assume 
that the resistors also satisfy the balanced bridge condition, 
we can achieve the output impedance equal to be infinite.

tively approximate 100 kHz and 30 kHz. However, their 
asymptotic value is near 1mA.  
According to frequency response, these devices of 
THS4021, LM833 and LM741 are chose as the simulation 
models. In computer simulation, the frequency responses of 
the circuit are obtained respectively for three different cir-
cuit types. The response results are shown in Fig. 7 and 8 
respectively. Based on these results, it is found that one-op-
amp circuit type has the property of higher-frequency re-
sponse. When we employ the device with high-frequency 
response, the appearance of the response is not obvious.  
When using the one-op-amp circuit type and injecting 
voltage signal at amplitude of 1V, in 1MHz, the output 
current magnitudes are obtained by varying the load resis-
tance of RL changed from 1ȍ to 1kȍ. Then the results of the 
mean and standard deviation (STD) of output current are 
listed in Table 2, respectively for three different models of 
THS4021, LM833 and LM741. For THS4021 device, the 
mean and standard deviation of output current are 
1.00028mA and s0.00008mA. The percentage of variation 
is about s0.0.01051%. And for LM833 device, the mean of 
output current is approximate 1mA; the percentage of varia-
tion of standard deviation is about 0.01051%. But for 
LM741 device, the mean of output current is less then 1mA. 
The current sources cannot export the constant amplitude of 
current designed by us. Duo to the time response analysis in 
computer simulation as applying the sine wave, this analysis 
result shows two phenomena such as long leg and wave-
form distortion. 
We employ the test structure given above to obtain the 
output impedance for using different op-amp devices. The 
simulated results of output impedance are acquired while 
using different op-amp circuit types and varying frequency 
from 1kHz to 1MHz. These results are listed in Table 3. For 
THS4021 op-amp, the simulation data display the output 
impedance values from 7.5Mȍ to 110kȍ. Then for low-
frequency response device of LM741, the impedance is 
about 90kȍ. The output impedance in one-op-amp circuit 
type is higher than in two or three op-amp circuit types. The 
results show that it is significant to use an op-amp device 
with high-frequency response. Of course the output imped-
ance is depended on the different op-amp device. 
B. Results of real experiments 
Fig. 9 shows the simulated (dashed lines) and measured

capacitance for each op-amp device, these results can be 
calculated by the least square method. After calculating 
processes, the near stray capacitor values are displayed in 
left below of Fig. 9. The tendencies of the computer simula-
tion by considering the stray capacitances are similar than 
those of practical measurements.

Abstract- If the oral cavity tumor can be found and treated 
in early days, we can improve cure rate of patient. So 
diagnosing disease early is most important to treat cancer. 
Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a kind of 
bio-impedance measurement technology. It has some 
advantages including inexpensiveness, non-radioactive injury 
and easily operating. In the thesis, via implementing the 
program with interpolation processing, we can extract the 
characteristic parameters. From experimental results, it was 
verified that radius of semicircle fitted with the electrical 
impedance readings is apparent decrease with interval time 
and pressure applied increase. So, two factors are important 
for EIS. The rfc parameter exhibits significant correlation with 
carcinogenesis period. The rRo values also show significant 
relation with carcinogenesis period. From experimental results 
of oral cavity tumor tissues, we can clearly differentiate 
between normal and tumor tissue.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy-EIS may have the 
ability to separate normal and cancerous tissues. And it has 
some advantages including non-invasively, inexpensiveness, 
non-radioactive injury and easily operating. According to 
the 2007 vital statistical report of cancer deaths of 
Department of Health in Taiwan, oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for the fourth leading cancer 
deaths in Taiwanese male population. But OSCC patients up 
to more than 90% are men. Especially, the occurred ratio of 
OSCC is the first for men between 31 to 45 years old. Oral 
cavity cancer usually is found in the epidermis mucous cell 
of oral cavity. It is easy to use survey device to detect. So 
the purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity of EIS 
to early OSCC tumor growth. A lot of scholars have 
published quite a lot of research papers about applying EIS 
technique to excise normal and cancerous tissues. Some 
researcher addressed the EIS technology is sensitive to early 
tumor growth. The researchers implanted the tumor cell to 
the muscle of animal. Simultaneously, they obtained 
conventional images such as computed tomography, 
ultrasound and biopsy images. It was found that EIS can 
successfully be employed to indicate any morphological or 
physiological changes that occur with the presence of 
tumors [1]. The other researchers study about EIS 
measurement in vivo for human tissues such as bladder, 
skin, stomach, and breast. And except they measured 
electrical impedance, they talked biopsy samples and 
traditional image. And they compared measurements from 
EIS with these from other technologies. Then they used the 
receiver operating characteristic curve to indicate that the 
EIS method could provide diagnostic information. They 
also think this method is a better assessment tool than the 
traditional image method [2,3]. Several researchers had 
published papers about the relationship between resistivity 
and applying pressure for human tissue. They found that the 
resistivity increase with applying pressure increase, and 
pointed out that these increases can be higher than those 
associated with the pathological changes [4]. Some authors 
reported the relationship between characteristic parameters 
and measurement time after excision. They found that the 
significant changes of characteristic parameters of different 
tissues with measurement time [5,6]. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Electrode characteristics 
Glass-fiber PCB printed electrode boards available on 
the market were used as electrode substrates. The boards 
had copper foil thickness of 1.6mm. The glass-fiber material 
was FR-4. The surfaces of copper electrodes were overlaid 
with an oxidized layer due to oxidization, thus necessitating 
gilding surface treatment in order to attain superior 
interfacing characteristics and increase the conductivity of 
the electrodes. The diameters of the inner electrode, gap and 
outer electrode were 2mm, 4mm and 8mm respectively, as 
shown in Figure 1. The electrodes employed joints to 
connect with LCR meter. And the gilding electrodes are 
disposable in order to prevent opportunities for mutual 
contamination between the test objects and the operators or 
between test objects. 
Fig.1 Disposable electrode

constituted a change of approximately 100:. The measured 
electrical impedance readings range from 100: to 300:.
Apparently, applying pressure is important factor. We think 
that a possible reason may be that pressure on the test 
objects cause changes in the distance between cells. At 
present, measurements were performed under constant 
pressure, thus excluding the error factor caused by pressure.

increase
C. Measurement of relationship between time and 
electrical impedance 
After the test tissue was excised from the pig body, the 
electrical impedance was measured for the same location. 
Measurement was performed once every hour.  
Fig. 5 Changes in the electrical impedance of pork with increase in time  
The semicircle in the Cole-Cole plot resulting from changes 
in time can be seen in Figure 5. And the radius continually 
decreases. It can be preliminarily postulated that when 
tissues have been excised from the body for increasingly 
long amounts of time, the cell biology structure in the 
tissues will shrink due to gradual loss of moisture, causing a 
decrease in distance between cells. A corresponding 
decrease in resistance and reactance is obtained. From 
results, the measurement time also is important information. 
Current clinical measurements are immediately performed 
after surgery so as to exclude the impact factor of time. 
D. Clinical oral cancer tissue experimental measurements 
After the oral tumors were excised through oral surgery 
at Chi-mei Hospital, doctors confirmed the location of 
tumors so that EIS measurement could immediately be 
performed in clinical experiments, The spectrums of the 
tumor locations, tumor boundaries, and normal tissues were 
measured respectively. It can be seen from measurement 
data that the three different regions mentioned above have 
obvious qualitative characteristic. 
Fig. 6 Cole-Cole plots for normal, boundary, and tumor tissue
Figure 6 depicts the electrical impedance spectrum data for 
the three locations of normal, boundary, and tumor tissues. 
At present, the identical characteristic trends can be seen for 
three tumor tissues. Normal tissues exhibits higher 
resistance and reactance values and have larger radii in their 
semicircles. Tumor tissue has smaller resistance and 
reactance and thus has semicircles with smaller radii. 
Boundary tissue between normal and tumor tissue exhibits 
values in between those of the other two. The four important 
characteristic parameter values in Table 1 can be obtained 
by performing characteristic parameters extraction for the 
measured data. 
Table 1  Characteristic parameter values 
E. Analysis of characteristic parameter values and 
biological tissue characteristics 
(1) Parameter analysis 
Table 1 shows the characteristic parameters of three sets 
of clinical tumor tissue. The r shows the proportional values 
of measurements from normal tissue divided by 
measurements from tumor tissue. The far right side of Table 
1 shows the size of tumor tissue and the carcinogenesis 
period obtained by reading cross-sections of tumor tissue. 
By observing the obtained parameter values and 
carcinogenesis periods, it can preliminarily be determined 
that there is no direct relationship between rRf and rD
parameter values. On the other hand, rfc and carcinogenesis 
period do exhibit significant positive correlation. The rRo

The device supports a simple measuring method to obtain 
freshness of pork been bought by consumers on traditional market. 
The device has some advantages including easy carrying and using. 
We employ bioelectrical impedance spectral method to detect fresh 
characteristic parameters of pork. The bioelectrical impedance 
spectral method is used to eject alternating current with different 
frequency to target and to measure voltage via the electrode on target 
surface, and then the impedances of the different frequencies can be 
obtained. We use algorithm with the impedance values at different 
frequencies substituted to obtain freshness index of pork.!
