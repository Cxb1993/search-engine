ABSTRACT 
 This project presents a nonlinear dynamic analysis of a 3-PRS series-parallel 
machine tool with consideration of joint effects which includes flexibility, clearance 
and friction. The Newtonian approach is applied to derive the equations of motion of 
the 3-PRS mechanism. The Runge-Kutta method and contact verification criterion are 
combined to solve the nonlinear piecewise differential equations. The linearization

Although many issues of parallel mechanisms such as kinematics, dynamics, 
stiffness analysis, error analysis, calibrations and controls were studied extensively in 
the past [9-15], joint clearance effects in parallel mechanisms have not been 
investigated by many researchers. Since a parallel mechanism is considered as a 
multibody system, joints are important components to connect an individual body 
together. The joint behaviors such as clearance, friction, lubrication and impact forces 
can have a significant effect on dynamic response of the parallel system. For instance, 
the impact forces due to clearance might induce noise and vibration, and results in a 
loss of precision and a life shortage. 
Early researchers treat a body’s connections in parallel mechanism as ideal joints; 
that is, a joint is considered as a spring with no clearance (Sunada and Dobowsky [16]; 
Lowen and Chassapis [17]). In investigating non-ideal joints’ behaviors, including 
joint clearances, damping and stiffness, most researches were only focused on planar 
mechanisms with rigid links, and have proposed some mathematical joint models to 
study joint effects on planar mechanisms (Dubowsky and Freudenstein [18]; Haines 
[19]; Bagci and Khosravi [20], Schwab et al. [21]). Experiments were performed to 
verify the proposed models (Dubowsky and Gardner [22]; Dubowsky and Moening 
[23]; Haines [24]; Haug et al. [25]). Liu and Lin [26] included the lubrication effect to 
establish a more complete joint model. For spatial mechanisms, contact dynamics of a 
spherical joint was presented by Tzou and Rong [27]. Furthermore, stochastic 
simulation of dynamic characteristics of elastically jointed structures has been 
developed by Rong and Tzou [28]. Bauchau and Rodriguez [29] proposed a spatial 
model including the effects of joint clearance and lubrication for three dimension 
mechanisms. However, numerical simulation in their papers only demonstrated their 
results in planar mechanism.

function. Then the linearized dynamic equations of motion are developed. The natural 
frequencies distribution using the linearized dynamic equations is compared with 
those obtained by the impulse response approach. The joint clearance effects 
including joint flexibility, joint clearance and friction effect are discussed particularly 
for the spatial mechanism. The effects of the parameters including the sliders’ location, 
the stiffness of joints, the length of links, the density of the links, the radius of the 
base platform and the radius of the moving platform on the natural frequencies are 
analyzed. Finally, the optimization designs of tool-tip displacement and structural 
weight subjected to dynamic constraints of natural frequencies are studied by using 
the genetic algorithm. 
 
2. THE FORMULATION OF THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION 
The 3-PRS mechanism under investigation consists of three ball screws, three 
sliders, three links, and a moving platform as shown in Figure 2. The connection 
between the ball screw and slider is regarded as a prismatic pair. The revolute joints 
are used to connect the sliders and the links, and the spherical joints are utilized to 
connect the links and the moving platform. A spindle is mounted on the moving 
platform when the 3-PRS mechanism is applied to the machine tool.  The position 
and posture of the moving platform can be controlled by the feed system of the sliders 
and the ball screws. For precision positioning of the moving platform, the dynamic 
analysis of the 3-PRS mechanism is very important. However, the dynamics of the 
3-PRS mechanism with flexible linkages and joints is complicated. Moreover, the 
stiffness of the joints is usually less than 1/10 of that of the link, and they are the 
weakest components in the parallel mechanism. Neglecting the stiffness of the joints

joint clearance sδ  is defined as the difference of the inner radius of the socket and 
the outer radius of the ball. It is assumed that the joint contact is decomposed into two 
components. The first is the normal contact and the second is the friction force acting 
in the tangential direction. It is also assumed that the clearance is large enough to 
allow relative motion of the socket and ball, so that the joint “sticktion” is not 
considered. 
The normal contact force , due to the joint stiffness and damping, is 
expressed as:

 4. NATURAL FREQUENCY AND MODE SHAPE 
 The natural frequencies of the 3-PRS mechanism are very important when it is 
applied to a machine tool. A nonlinear system does not have natural frequencies. 
However, one can find natural frequencies at the given positions under the assumption 
of small vibrations. Generally, there are two approaches to find natural frequencies for 
a nonlinear system. One is the nonlinear simulation using an impulse response to 
excite the system, and the other is the linear analysis where the nonlinear dynamic 
equations are linearized into a set of ordinary differential equations. The impulse 
response approach is typically used in experiments and can be applied to obtain the 
system natural frequencies, and modal testing can be used to find the mode shape. But 
it might not be suitable for symmetric mechanism because one particular natural 
frequency can correspond to several mode shapes. In our case, five mode shape 
couples correspond to the same natural frequency at the position of ,  
and . The linearized equations of motion can be utilized to recognize the 
repeated natural frequencies, and the mode shapes can also be obtained. However, the 
friction and clearance effects are not continuous functions, and the effects are 
neglected first in the linearization process. Their effects are analyzed by using the 
impulse response method.

03 =S
 The linearized equations can be obtained by expanding the nonlinear equations 
(13)~(20) in the Taylor series regarding the equilibrium position. By ignoring the high 
order terms, the linearized equations of motion regarding the equilibrium can be 
represented in matrix form as

The natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes can be obtained by solving 
equation (30). iλ  are the complex frequencies which the imaginary part iω  are the 
damped natural frequencies and the real part iσ  are the corresponding damping 
exponents. 
 
5. OPTIMIZATION APPROACH 
  The tool-tip displacement is the most important performance of a machine tool.
One can reduce the tool-tip displacement by adding the structural weight and 
changing the geometry of the mechanism. But the structural weight affects the 
machining speed. Thus, the objective of the optimization approach given in this 
project of minimizing the tool-tip displacement and the structural weight. The tool-tip 
displacement can be determined by using the Runge-Kutta method. The design 
variables including the density of the links Lρ , the length of the links , the radius 
of the links , the density of the moving platform 
LL
LR Pρ , the radius of the base 
platform  and the radius of the moving platform  are chosen to be the design 
variable of the optimization problem. The dynamic constraints in the optimization 
problem is to avoid the natural frequencies of the series-parallel mechanism closing 
the excitation frequency. 0.9 and 1.1 are the safety factors due to the natural 
frequencies of the series-parallel mechanism shifting with the feed positions. The 
optimization problem can be stated as

excited due to the damping effect such as the modes at 16.72 Hz, 44.49 Hz, 50.36 Hz 
and 53.59 Hz. However, there are only nine resonance frequencies excited in Figure 5.  
The linear analysis is used to help in finding the repeated natural frequencies. Table 2 
presents the natural frequencies and their associated mode shapes calculated by using 
the linearized model. Fifteen modes are obtained by solving the characteristic 
equation of the linearized equations of motion.  
 Figure 6 shows the variation of the natural frequencies versus the position of 
slider 2. Table 3 presents the natural frequencies and their associated mode shapes at 
the configuration of , m01 =S m 01.02 =S  and m 03 =S . Note that the modes are 
numbered by their order at m01 =S , m 01.02 =S  and m 03 =S ; the mode 
numbers are not rearranged for other positions. Comparing Table 2, Table 3 and 
Figure 6, it can be found that some of the natural frequencies will change with the 
slider’s position. However, some of them, such as modes 1, 6, 7, 8 and 9, almost 
remain the same as the slider changes its position. Close observation of the above 
mode shapes are shown in Tables 2 and 3, and the corresponding weighting factors, 
pα  and pβ , in the above modes are close to zero. Thus, the variation of the natural 
frequencies may directly correlate to the posture of the moving platform. This is due 
to the posture of the moving platform will influence the distribution of the equivalent 
stiffness. Furthermore, rotating the mode shapes of the three links listed in Table 2 to 
the global frame, the mode shapes of the 3-PRS mechanism can be illustrated as 
shown in Figure 7. The mode shapes can be categorized into five classes and are 
shown as follows: 
(1) Class 1 represents the motion which is dominated by vertical motion such as 
modes 1 and 9. The links and the moving platform vibrate in the same 
 18
 Figure 8 shows the response of the tool-tip with the joint clearance effect. The 
excitation force is chosen as )20sin(100 tgmf P π+= N acting at the tool-tip in the 
Z -direction. The constant part of the excitation force is selected as  N. If the 
excitation force is not large enough to overcome the weight of the moving platform, 
the free-flight mode of the joint clearance will not occur, and the joint clearance effect 
can be neglected. Figure 8 also shows that the tool-tip displacement becomes larger as 
joint clearance increases since the free moving space is increased. Figure 9(a) shows 
the power spectrum of the tool-tip displacement in 
gmP
X -direction under impulsive 
excitation. It is shown that the natural frequencies of the first, third and fourth 
resonances decrease as the joint clearance becomes larger. It is because the joint 
clearance leads to the contact period being increased, which results in less contact 
between the ball and the socket within a given period. Moreover, by comparing the 
frequency responses due to the joint clearance and friction effects in Figure 9(a), it is 
found that the friction particularly increases the magnitude of the fourth resonance 
more significantly as compared to other mode excitation. The friction has more 
influence on the rotational mode due to the moment caused by the friction force, and 
the fourth resonance is just mainly formed by the rotational motion of links. Based on 
these results and observations of the mode shapes, it is found that the joint clearance 
and friction significantly affect the modes by which the rotational motions are 
dominate. This observation can provide more insights in designing joints under 
friction effects, and no research has been performed to study the shifting of natural 
frequencies due to friction effect. 
 A similar phenomenon is also shown in Figure 9(b). It is mentioned that the 
super harmonic of mode 12 is excited with the joint clearance and friction effects. 
Figure 10 shows the power spectrum of the deformation of revolute and spherical 
 20
Only the natural frequency of mode 15 remains constant as the density of links 
changes. It is because that the motion of mode 15 is only the rotational motion of the 
moving platform. The radius of the links and the base platform almost do not affect 
the natural frequencies. Only the natural frequencies of modes 12 and 13 slightly 
decrease as the radius of the links increases. It is because that the rotational motion of 
the links is the main motion in these two modes. When the radius of the moving 
platform increases, the natural frequencies of modes 2, 4 and 15 decreases and the 
natural frequencies of mode 10 increases. The other natural frequencies almost keep 
constant as the radius of the moving platform changes. It is because that the rotational 
motion is dominated in modes 2, 4, 10 and 15. Note that the effect of the radius of the 
moving platform is overlapped with the effect of the stiffness of the spherical joint in 
Figure 15. All of the natural frequencies increase as the stiffness of the spherical joint 
increases. Most of the natural frequencies increase as the stiffness of the revolute joint 
increases. Only the natural frequency of mode 15 is not affected by the stiffness of the 
revolute joints. It is because that the motion of mode 15 is only the rotational motion 
of the moving platform and the moving platform is not connected to another links by 
revolute joints. Comparing these results, one can obtain that the length of the links, 
the density of the links and the stiffness of the joints are significantly affected the 
natural frequencies. For most of modes, the effect of the stiffness of the revolute joints 
 22
our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) The natural frequencies are the 
function of the sliders’ location, and the shifting trends can be explained by analyzing 
their associated mode shapes. (2) The joint clearance significantly affects the modes 
by which the rotational motions are dominated. Some of the natural frequencies 
decrease as the joint clearance increase. Especially, the mode 12 and its super 
harmonic frequencies are obviously induced due to the joint clearance and friction 
effect. (3) The dynamic response becomes larger as the joint clearances increase, and 
the contact force increases as the joint clearance and the friction coefficient increase. 
(4) The length of the links, the density of the links and the stiffness of the joints are 
significantly affected the natural frequencies. The effects of the stiffness of the 
revolute joints is larger than that of the spherical joint except for mode 9. (5) Through 
the multi-objective optimization design, the tool-tip displacement and the structural 
weight can be successfully reduced simultaneously. These observations can provide 
useful information towards the design of series-parallel machine tool.
