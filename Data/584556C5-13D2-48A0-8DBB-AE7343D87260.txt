報告內容： 
一、第一年計畫：綠光波長(532nm)感光的液晶全像材料研發 
1. 樣本製做： 
樣本的結構簡圖如(圖一)所示，在氧化銦鍚(ITO)玻璃上旋轉塗佈水平配向膜PI，摩
擦出光的那面玻璃，並以塑膠微粒與塑膠墊片分別控制樣本的厚度為6㎛或225㎛。所使
用的材料為甲基紅(Methyl Red, MR)加液晶E7，MR的濃度為5 wt%，再以毛細現象和重
力作用使材料填入液晶盒中。 
2. 實驗架構： 
寫入光柵和量測繞射效率所用的實驗架構如(圖二)所示。波長532㎚的DPSS雷射
(Diode-Pumped Solid-State Lasers)經空間濾波器(SF2)和透鏡(Lens)擴束為平面波後，極化
分光鏡(PBS2)將光分為垂直極化的線性極化光，再加上一個面鏡(M4)使垂直極化的兩道
光在樣本處重疊產生干涉圖形。樣本中的染料受光激發後會產生光致同分異構化，因而
將干涉圖形計錄下來，形成極化光柵。另在PBS2前放置一個半波板(HP1)以調制S、P偏
振的光強比。量測繞射效率時，以波長612㎚的氦氖雷射(HeNe Laser)調成入光光強為10 
µW的S偏極化的平面波，其極化的控制是用極化分光鏡(PBS1)。

about 50 W/cm2. A detector was used to measure
the diffracted power of the +1 order diffraction.
In our first experiments, we measured the genera-
tion dynamics of the polarization holographic grat-
ings with three different recording beam ratios. The
total intensity of two writing beams was kept at
9.8 mW/cm2, and three different beam ratios were
generated by rotating the HWP in the plane perpen-
dicular to the incident wave. The experimental re-
sults are shown in Fig. 2(a). We found that the satu-
ration diffraction efficiencies of the polarization
holograms recorded with beam ratios of 1:1, 4:1, and
10:1 were 7.5%, 12.8.%, and 18%, respectively.
In the second experiments, the TE polarized refer-
ence beam was kept at 4.9 mW/cm2, but the TM po-
larized signal beams were attenuated to generate dif-
ferent intensities by using an attenuator. Figure 2(b)
shows the corresponding experimental results.
Again, we found that the maximum diffraction effi-
ciencies of the polarization hologram recorded with
beam ratios of 1:1, 4:1, and 10:1 were about 7.5%,
13%, and 18%, respectively.
From the results, we can find that the polarization
hologram almost generates equal saturation diffrac-
tion efficiency when the recording beam ratio re-
mains the same. The phenomenon shows that the
saturation diffraction efficiency of the polarization
hologram depends on the recording intensity ratio
only and is independent of the total recording power.
However, in comparison with the curves recorded
with a beam ratio of 10:1 in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), we
can find that when the total recording power is
larger, the formation rate becomes higher. Our ex-
periments also prove that the maximum diffraction
efficiency of a polarization hologram could be in-
creased by using two writing beams with unequal in-
tensities. Figure 3 shows the relationship between
the saturation diffraction efficiency of a polarization
hologram and its corresponding recording intensity
ratio. As shown in Fig. 3, the maximum diffraction ef-
ficiency that can be achieved in this sample is 23%
when the TE:TM recording intensity ratio was 7:1.
The optimal TE:TM recording intensity ratio is esti-
mated to locate in the range from 4:1 to 10:1.
When the interference field is formed by one TE
wave and one TM wave, the resulting modulated pat-
terns along the horizontal position with two different
recording intensity ratios are described in Fig. 4. Ir-
radiating our samples with such a light pattern, the
azo dyes within the films will undergo trans–cis
isomerization accompanied with reorientation, diffu-
sion, and, finally, adsorption onto the substrate sur-
face. Liquid crystals were then reoriented to align
with the adsorbed dyes. Since these two fields as
shown in Fig. 4 have the same polarization period,
we believe that adsorbed dyes will generate polariza-
tion gratings with equal periods. However, they
might induce different diffusion processes and leads
to different relief depths of the adsorbed dyes. Figure
5(a) shows the experimental observation images of
these two gratings from an optical polarization mi-
croscope. The images indicate the periods of these
two grating are both about 6.9 m. Each of recorded
samples mentioned above was then decomposed into
two glass slides, and then the liquid crystals were re-
moved from the material system. We found that the
residual dyes were adsorbed on the inner surface of
the un-rubbed glass substrate. Figure 5(b) shows the
experimental observation images of the surface relief
structures of the adsorbed dyes from an atomic force
microscope. We found that the grating periods are

Abstract. A nonvolatile reading of erasable polarization holo-
grams in dye-doped liquid-crystal films using the same writing
wavelength is presented. The recorded hologram can be eas-
ily erased with the illumination of one p-polarized wave; nev-
ertheless, it becomes nonvolatile when reading the hologram
with one s-polarized wave. We have proven the nonvolatile
reading property is induced by dye adsorption on the sub-
strate of the sample. C© 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Paper 110254LR received Mar. 17, 2011; revised manuscript re-
ceived Apr. 30, 2011; accepted for publication May 23, 2011; pub-
lished online Jul. 6, 2011.
Photorefractive crystals1, 2 and azo-dye-doped liquid
crystals3–5 are currently attractive rewritable materials for
holographic memory. However, the reversibility of these ma-
terials also leads to volatile readout, i.e., the recorded holo-
gram would be gradually erased during the readout process.
For photorefractive crystals, one method for overcoming the
obstacle is using a fixing technique,1, 2 and the other solu-
tion is to read the hologram at a longer wavelength.6 For
azo-dye-doped liquid crystals, owing to their reversible pro-
cess of trans–cis photoisomerization makes them become
the promising rewritable materials for holographic optical
recording. Even though it has been proven that the recorded
holograms in azo-dye-doped liquid crystals can persist for a
long time in the dark,5 using the same recording wavelength
for readout is much less discussed. Previous research groups
still use a light with a longer wavelength far from the absorp-
tion band as a reading beam to avoid erasure effect. In this
letter, we demonstrate our study on nonvolatile reading prop-
erty of recorded holograms in azo-dye-doped liquid crystals
using the same recording wavelength.
The dye-doped liquid crystal films used in this exper-
iment were fabricated with nematic liquid crystal E7 and
methyl red (MR). The mixing ratio, MR:E7, of these two
components was 4:96 wt. %. Two glass slides coated with
0091-3286/2011/$25.00 C© 2011 SPIE
indium tin oxide were separated by 6 μm plastic spacers to
fabricate an empty cell with dimension of 2 cm × 3 cm.
Two glasses are coated with polyimide film, and only one of
them is rubbed. The homogeneously mixed compound was
then injected into the empty cell to form a dye-doped liquid
crystal sample. The liquid crystal molecules were aligned
with the rubbed surface. The sample structure is shown in
Fig. 1(a). If irradiating an azo-dye-doped liquid crystal film
with two orthogonally polarized waves, the polarization di-
rection of the generated interference light field is periodi-
cally modulated in space. Then the azo-dye molecules are
photoexcited from trans-state to cis-state and their molecular
reorientation is orthogonal to the local polarization direction
of the spatially modulated field. The reoriented dyes will
diffuse and then adsorb onto cell substrates to generate a
microgroove structure. The process is accompanied by liq-
uid crystal (LC) reorientation, and accordingly a polarization
hologram is generated.4
The experimental setup for generating a polarization holo-
gram in dye-doped liquid crystal films is shown in Fig. 1(b).
The polarization holographic gratings were generated by one
s-polarized and one p-polarized plane wave. The rubbing di-
rection of the sample was perpendicular to the incident plane
of the experimental system. In this experimental setup, the
incident angle of reference beam was kept at deg in the air. An
s-polarized He–Ne laser beam with wavelength of 612 nm
was used to probe the grating. The intensity of the probe beam
was about 50 μw/cm2. A detector was used to measure the
diffracted power of the + 1 order diffraction. In the writing
process, the polarization holographic gratings were gener-
ated by two orthogonally polarized writing beams with equal
intensity. In the reading process, we blocked the p-polarized
recording beam, and an s-polarized recording beam with
11.6 mw/cm2 intensity was incident on the sample. Then,
in the erasable process, we blocked the s-polarized record-
ing beam, and a p-polarized recording beam also with
11.6 mw/cm2 intensity was incident on the sample. The
dynamic change of diffraction efficiency measured by the
probed beam during recording, reading, and erasable pro-
cess is shown in Fig. 2(a). From Fig. 2(a), we can find when
the hologram was illuminated with one s-polarized wave, the
diffraction efficiency of the hologram was very stable during
the continuous 6 h readout process. Once the hologram is
illuminated with a p-polarized wave, the holographic grating
is erased effectively.
For proving the effect of dye adsorption on a nonvolatile
reading, we prepared another sample in which doped dye
does not adsorb on a substrate. The new sample structure
was the same with MR doped liquid crystals except MR
dyes were replaced with D2 dyes. We repeated the writ-
ing, reading, and erasing process. The dynamic change of
diffraction efficiency is shown in Fig. 2(b). We found that
when the recorded hologram was either illuminated with
one s-polarized wave or one p-polarized wave, the hologram
would be erased. Apparently, nonvolatile reading property
is not observed in D2-doped liquid crystals. Adsorbed dyes
after the writing process can be observed by the following
material analyses. First, we recorded one polarization holo-
gram in each of the two different dye-doped samples. After
that, the recorded samples were decomposed into two glass
slides, and then the liquid crystals were removed from the
material system. We found the residual MR dyes (red color)
were adsorbed on the inner surface of the un-rubbed glass

The mechanism of nonvolatile reading with s-polarization
light and erasure with p-polarization light can be associated
with adsorption of dyes and reorientation of the adsorbed
dyes. Before recording the polarization hologram, the dye
and liquid crystal molecules are aligned with the rubbed
surface such that they are all parallel to the s-polarized di-
rection. During recording process, the azo-dye molecules
are photoexcited from trans-state to cis-state and they ori-
entate from the s-polarized direction. Then the photoexcited
dye molecules are diffused and adsorbed onto cell substrates
with their new orientation to generate a microgroove struc-
ture. The process will continue until reaching the saturated
state, i.e., all the dye molecules which can participate in this
mechanism have been reoriented and adsorbed on the sub-
strate. Liquid crystal molecules nearby the unrubbed sub-
strate will align with the adsorbed dyes, and those nearby the
rubbed substrate will align along the s-polarized direction,
and therefore a twisted nematic grating structure is gener-
ated. In the reading process, illumination with s-polarized
light does not harm the recorded hologram because there no
more dye molecules will be reoriented, and those adsorbed
dyes have already been reoriented in a stable direction for
s-polarized light. During the erasure process, the dye
molecules on the microgroove structure were excited by
the p-polarized erase wave and their reorientation became
orthogonal to the p-polarization direction. Reorientation of
the adsorbed dyes leads to the orientation of the whole liq-
uid crystal molecules going back to the initial state, i.e., all
molecules are parallel to the s-polarized direction and, there-
fore, the twisted nematic grating structure disappeared.
In conclusion, we have presented the nonvolatile reading
of erasable polarization holograms in MR-dye-doped liquid
crystal films using the same writing wavelength. We find
an s-polarized wave during the recording process can be
used for nonvolatile readout and a p-polarized wave can be
used to erase the holographic gratings effectively. Nonvolatile
reading in dye-doped liquid crystal films is attributed to
the dye adsorption effect, and destructive readout appears
when the doped dyes do not adsorb on the substrate.

1. Introduction 
One economic method to generate autostereoscopic effect without wearing eyeglasses on a 
liquid crystal display (LCD) is using the so called multiplexed-2D-images technology [1] 
based on binocular parallax of human beings. This technology is implemented by displaying 
two similar plane images but with a slightly different viewing angle on the panel 
simultaneously and then let these two individual images only propagate to their corresponding 
single eye of an observer. To display these two similar plane images on the panel 
simultaneously, one of them can be shown on odd column pixels only and another one can be 
shown on even column pixels. If the image shown on odd column pixels only propagates to 
observer’s right eye and the image shown on even column pixels only propagates to 
observer’s left eye, we can obtain the stereoscopic vision. Accordingly, an image splitter used 
to separate these two images is an essential optical element for stereoscopic display in a LCD 
panel. 
Present device for image splitter in stereo-display focuses on lenticular lens [2,3] and 
parallax barrier [4,5] technology. They both are economic methods and have been widely used 
in the commercial market for their low cost. However, the disadvantage of the current 
lenticular display is that the considerable cross talk noise could be induced by the fabrication 
error of the lenticular sheet or the alignment error between the lenticular sheet and the display 
panel [6–8]. The other method, parallax barrier technology, is implemented by pixel shielding 
with a binary grating. Inherently, the barrier technology reduces the brightness of displays. 
Recently, Chen et al. proposed an improvement method by coating a reflection layer inside 
the panel to enhance the brightness in a stereo-display with barrier shielding [9]. However, the 
current best brightness performance can be reached in a barrier stereo-display is only 43% of 
the original brightness [9]. Moreover, unlike the lenticular sheet which is attached on the 
image panel, the binary grating should be placed in front of the panel with a finite distance 
and accordingly an additional precise alignment could be required in the assemble process of 
a barrier stereo-display. 
Alternatively, we propose a new type image splitter for stereogram application on a LCD 
panel in this paper. The proposed technology is implemented by replacing the lenticular lens 
and parallax barrier with a holographic optical element (HOE). Though the concept of using a 
HOE for stereogram application on LCD panel has been proposed [10–13], the practical 
implementation results of image separation or image directing for stereoscopic vision using a 
HOE has not experimentally presented yet. In this paper, we have experimentally shown that 
stereoscopic right and left images can be separated successfully. In addition, the contracture of 
the proposed HOE in this paper is also different from the previous researches. Unlike the 
HOE proposed by D. Trayner et al. is a composition of several row sub-holograms [10,11], 
the HOE we fabricated is a composition of several column sub-holograms. The HOE 
fabricated with our design leads to compatibility for the column-spatial-multiplexed image 
contents which are already prepared for the lenticular lens and parallax barrier technology. 
Moreover, the HOE proposed by B. C. Cho et al. is an angle-multiplexed hologram designed 
for time-sequential autostereoscopic display [12,13], but our HOE is a spatial-multiplexed 
hologram designed for column-spatial-multiplexed autostereoscopic display. 
In this paper, we have proposed a new type HOE to generate an image splitter for 
stereogram application on a LCD panel. The holographic image splitter is designed to locate 
at the image panel to separate and direct light for images with different viewing angles to 
propagate into observer’s corresponding eyes. Once the holographic image splitter is 
fabricated and attached on a conventional panel with proper alignment, an autostereoscopic

propagate to the right eye, and sub-holograms above the even column pixels will diffract the 
images shown on L column pixels to propagate to the left eye. 
In order to experience the stereo vision described above, the left and right images have to 
be delivered into observer’s left and right eye respectively with proper propagation angles. As 
shown in Fig. 2, we assume the distance between the two eyes is 2W and the distance between 
panel and the observer is H, the propagation angle of the diffraction beam from the sub-
holograms on even and odd column pixels can be calculated by

where  is defined as the split angle of the holographic image splitter. In this study, we 
assume the binocular distance 2W is 6cm and the viewing distance H is 20cm. From formula 
(1), the required split angle is about 8 degrees. Split angle is an important parameter which is 
corresponding to the holographic interference angle in the following fabrication process of the 
required HOE. 
3. Optical experiments 
3.1 Fabrication of HOE 
Figure 3 shows the experimental system to fabricate the required holographic optical element. 
A diode-pump-solid state laser with 532nm wavelength was used as the light source for the 
holographic experiments. Two beam splitters (BS) were utilized to divide the laser light into 3 
beams. Meanwhile, the three beams passed through the Fourier lenses to generate three

display panel and it was carefully aligned with the display pixels. In our demonstration, the 
laser is replaced by a green LED and the emitted central wavelength is 530nm. The beam 
emitted from the LED is collimated and incident on the LCD panel. We found the spatial-
multiplexed image prepared for stereo-effect on LCD was effectively separated via the HOE 
and this leaded to a stereoscopic vision with an around 20 cm viewing distance for observers. 
The separated right and left images were individually captured by CCD cameras, and they 
were also shown in Fig. 5. A further experiment is demonstrated to prove the validness of the 
image splitter. A special designed spatial-multiplexed image was prepared. This spatial-
multiplexed image displayed on R column pixels of the panel is a character “L” and the image 
displayed on L column pixels is a character “V”. Once the backlight pass through the LCD 
and HOE, two images on odd and even column pixels would be separated. Figure 6 shows the 
experimental result. Two images “L” and “V” were separated by our holographic beam 
splitter element and these two images were projected on a screen. Though the fabricated HOE 
generated 1 order diffraction, there was no obvious observed cross talk noise in our practical 
experiments.

4. Discussions 
4.1 Brightness 
The diffraction efficiency for each image is about 43% in our experimental element, and 
accordingly the brightness of the stereogram is about 43% of the original brightness on panel. 
The brightness performance is much better than the conventional barrier technology, which 
generate stereogram with low brightness only 23% of the original brightness on panel [9].we 
believed the brightness of the stereo-display using the proposed technique still can be 
improved by using thick holographic recording material which can generate larger diffraction 
efficiency. B.C. Cho et al. have reported their study results on the relationship between

5. Conclusions 
A new type of image splitter for stereoscopic vision on LCD panel is presented. The special 
designed holographic optical element can be attached on a conventional 2.2-in. liquid crystal 
display panel directly to replace the traditional image splitter in a stereoscopic display panel. 
The experimental results prove the proposed principle work successfully. The proposed 
technique can be further improved by using a thick recording material which can generate 
higher diffraction efficiency. Experimental results show the proposed technique generates 
good contrast ratio and brightness performance for stereogram application. The proposed 
holographic image splitter accordingly performs high potential as an alternative competing 
technology with lenticular and barrier stereo-displays.
