2介當然就成為解決這問題的一項可行途逕,因為光通訊已經有非常成熟的技術和產業.
然而現存半導體發光二極體或雷射半導體,大都是用直接能隙半導體,如 GaAs,要運用
在矽晶體的積體電路上,自然有技術上的種種困難等待解決. 當然,另一種方法,也是最
直接的解決方法,就是發展矽晶體的發光光源. 而事實上,矽晶體非直接能隙半導體發
光二極體的研究發展在最近也有了初步重大的結果[1-2],雖然它的發光效率比起直接
能隙半導體的發光二極體尚有一個至數個數量級的差別.
雖然矽晶體的發光二極體的研究發展已經獲得初步結果,但矽晶體雷射卻依然是尚
未被實現. 雖然用非直接能隙製成半導體雷射的可能性是相當低的,但理論上並非完全
不可能. 我們知道,任何材料要形成雷射第一要件就是要有光增益,也就是說,在有光增
益的材料中光的行進才會被放大. 而有光增益的必要條件,就是粒子數反轉. 也就是說,
材料介質中,粒子位於某高能階的粒子數要比位於某低能階的粒子數要多,也就是所謂
的粒子數反轉(population inversion), 而雷射可能發光的光子能量,就等於這二個能
階的能量差. 這粒子數反轉的條件在直接能隙半導體稱為 Bernard-Duraffourg
inversion condition,這個條件就是說電子在導帶的 Fermi 能量和電洞在價帶的 Fermi
能量之間的差大於光子能量. 直接能隙半導體雷射的注入電流,主要目的就是要提高載
子的濃度來達到粒子數反轉的條件的條件. 當然注入的載子並非全部提供粒子數反轉,
一部分注入的載子損耗在一些非發光的物理過程,這主要包括 SRH 和 Auger 的物理過
程的載子的損失. 當注入的載子的濃度足以克服載子的損失而達成粒子數反轉的條件,
這時半導體的光增益係數就會由負轉正而有光增益. 當然在雷射共振腔內,光增益必須
大到能克服光損耗才能產生雷射光,這光損耗主要包括 free carrier absorption 和
two photon absorption 的光子的損耗和雷射共振腔的 mirror loss. 直接能隙半導體
遠比非直接能隙半導體容易形成雷射,理論上是因為直接能隙半導體的激發放射光過程
是量子力學的一級躍遷,而 free carrier absorption 和 two photon absorption 卻是
二級躍遷,因此光增益較容易克服光損耗. 相反的,非直接能隙半導體的激發放射光過
程是量子力學的二級躍遷,和 free carrier absorption 和 two photon absorption 一
樣,即使有光增益,也很難克服相對應的光損耗來達成雷射形成的條件. 不過,上面的敘
述,只是非定量的猜測,若要做定量上的探討,還是須要透過實際的光增益係數的計算
 這正是本研究計劃主要的動機.
當然,Bernard-Duraffourg inversion condition 是直接能隙半導體要達成有光增
益的必要條件. 但非直接能隙半導體的有光增益的條件是甚麼,卻是至今尚未知道. 但
可預知的是,對於非直接能隙半導體的有光增益的條件不確定,將是實現矽晶體雷射的
首要理論瓶頸. 總而言之,邁向矽晶體雷射首要目標就是先要探討矽晶體雷射有光增益
的物理條件,這也是這個研究計畫的最主要目的.
4五、結果與討論
這個計畫,成功地達成下列二項主要成果:
1. 矽晶體光增益係數的理論計算: 這個計畫針對矽晶體光增益係數的計算,提出一
套至目前為止最正確且完備的理論模型. 根據這個理論模型,矽晶體光增益係數的計算
公式被推導得知.
2. 矽晶體有光增益的條件: 我們由這些計算,來估計達成矽晶體雷射所須要的物理
條件,並且由這樣嚴謹的理論,來預測矽晶體雷射在技術上是否實際可行. 而這理論也
得出類似 Bernard-Duraffourg inversion condition 非直接能隙半導體粒子數反轉的
條件,這是半導體理論的另一新穎的結果.

6Abstract
A theoretical model for the calculation of the optical gain coefficient of indirect-band gap
semiconductors is presented. An explicit formula for the calculation is derived from the
second-order time-dependent perturbation theory of quantum mechanics, which incorporates all
the eight possible processes of photon/phonon emission and absorption. Conditions for
achieving the population inversion and optical gain are investigated. The results show that,
under the assumptions of constant interaction matrix elements and a simplified band structure
with equal energy gaps at the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum, a rather
simple result can be obtained, in which the conditions for achieving population inversion and
optical gain are: in phonon-emission-dominant processes, the Fermi energy difference between
electrons and holes is required to be larger than the photon energy plus the phonon energy; in
phonon-absorption-dominant processes, the Fermi energy difference between electrons and holes
is required to be larger than the photon energy minus the phonon energy. Since phonon
absorption and emission processes coexist in a real situation, the realistic conditions for achieving
optical gain are far more complicated and should be calculated numerically. We calculated the
optical gain coefficient of bulk crystalline silicon. The results show that, without the
suppression of other second-order optical-loss processes (e.g., free-carrier absorption), it is
unlikely that the magnitude of optical gain will overcome the optical loss to achieve the lasing
condition for bulk crystalline silicon.
8calculating the optical gain coefficient of indirect bandgap semiconductors and an explicit
formula for its calculation. Taking bulk crystalline Si as an example, the physical conditions for
achieving population inversion and optical gain in an indirect-bandgap semiconductor will also
be investigated.
II. Theoretical Model
The calculation of the optical gain coefficient for an indirect-bandgap semiconductor is
based on the time-dependent perturbation theory of quantum mechanics, in which the
second-order transition rate (2)i fW from an initial state i via an intermediate state n to a
final state f due to the perturbation of the interaction Hamiltonian intH can be calculated by
using

int int(2) 2 ( )i f f i

W E E
E E
    , (1)
where ( )f iE E   is the delta function denoting the energy conservation between the system’s 
total initial energy iE and final energy fE . The summation includes all the possible
intermediate states but excludes the initial state. Because of the denominator factor
21 ( )i nE E , those intermediate states with energy nE far away from the initial state will not
contribute significantly to the transition rate. The interaction Hamiltonian is the result of

where only the emission and absorption of the electron-photon interaction Hamiltonians, eH
and aH, and the emission and absorption electron-phonon interaction Hamiltonians,
e
qH and
a
qH , will be considered in this problem.

where s N V  is defined as the photon density, N is the photon number, V is the
normalization volume of photons, and spon( )dn dt is optical processes due to the spontaneous
emission of photons whose rate is not dependent on the number of photons.
There are eight possible processes for the transition between ck and v k , as shown in
Fig. 1. They combine the sequential order of the emission and absorption of a photon and a
phonon, as indicated by the correspondent labels in Fig.1. For example, in Process 1, an
electron in the valence band absorbs a photon via an intermediate state of the conduction band,
and then absorbs a phonon and transits to an empty state of the conduction band. While in
Process 8, the reverse process of Process 1, an electron in the conduction band emits a phonon via
an intermediate state of the valence band, and then emits a photon and transits to an empty state
of the valence band. All the eight processes in Fig. 1 should be incorporated into Eq. (7) and (8).
With some elaborate derivations, the optical gain coefficient g can be explicitly calculated by
using

and might not be necessarily true in every case, in the cases in which Eq. (13) holds, a very
simple result can be derived as follows.
For the first or third term in the right hand side of Eq. (9), in which the phonon emission
is more dominant than the phonon absorption for conduction-band electrons, the condition for
achieving optical gain 0g  is
(1 )( 1) (1 )c v v cf f N f f N    k q k q k k q q . (14)
If carrier and phonons are under the same condition of thermal equilibrium, i.e., with the same
temperature, Eq. (14) will simply become
c v q gE        , (15)
where c v  is the Fermi energy difference between electrons and holes,  and q are
the energies of photons and phonons, respectively, and gE is the bandgap energy of the
indirect bandgap semiconductor. The Fermi energy difference between electrons and holes is
required to be larger than the photon energy plus the phonon energy, which then must be larger
than the bandgap energy.
Similarly, the second or fourth term in the right hand side of Eq. (9), in which
the phonon absorption is more dominant than the phonon emission for
conduction-band electrons, the condition for achieving optical gain is
(1 ) (1 )( 1)c v v cf f N f f N    k q k q k k q q . (16)
Consequently, the Fermi energy difference between electrons and holes is required to be larger
than the photon energy minus the phonon energy, and also the bandgap energy, which then must
be larger than the bandgap energy; i.e.,
c v q gE        . (17)
Eq. (15) and (17) are the necessary conditions for achieving population inversion and optical gain
in an indirect bandgap semiconductor in different processes as shown in Fig. 1. They will be the
necessary conditions for achieving the lasing condition in any indirect-bandgap semiconductor
laser as well.
It should be noted that the eight possible transition routes between a state in a conduction

IV. Conclusion
A theoretical model for the calculation of the optical gain coefficient of indirect bandgap
semiconductors has been outlined and presented. The explicit formula for this calculation has
also been derived. The conditions for achieving population inversion and optical gain in
indirect-bandgap semiconductor lasers are investigated. The results show that the conditions for
achieving population inversion and optical gain are: in phonon-emission-dominant processes, the
Fermi energy difference between electrons and holes is required to be larger than the photon
energy plus the phonon energy; in phonon-absorption-dominant processes, the Fermi energy
difference between electrons and holes is required to be larger than the photon energy minus the
phonon energy. Furthermore, the implications from the results for the possibility of achieving
the lasing condition in bulk crystalline Si lasers are briefly discussed. The results from the
numerical calculation show that, without the suppression of other second-order optical-loss
processes, such as free-carrier absorption, it is unlikely that the magnitude of optical gain will
overcome the optical loss to achieve the lasing condition for bulk crystalline silicon.
