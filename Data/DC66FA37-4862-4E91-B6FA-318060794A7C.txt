A. The Alamouti scheme
The factor graph of the Alamouti scheme in Fig. 2 involves
three elementary nodes of equality, multiplication, and com-
plex conjugate functions (see Appendix). After some algebraic
manipulations, we know that Gaussian messages propagating
in the forward (arrow) direction obey the following rules:

In order to compute the ML estimates of modulation sym-
bols, we need to calculate the Gaussian messages propagating
in the backward direction onto the linear transformation T of
Fig. 1. As shown in the factor graph of Fig. 3, these messages
can be obtained from the backward direction of the Alamouti
scheme over the noisy frequency-selective fading channel:

B. Linear transformation and optimal detection
Let the linear transformation T in Fig. 1 be represented
by an L × L matrix T = (tT
1
, . . . , tTL)
T
, where ti denotes
the ith row of T , i = 1, . . . , L. Similarly, denote the
2L × 1 output vector of the two linear transformations as
Q = (qT1 , . . . , q
T
L )
T
, where we define
qk =
(
tksodd
tkseven
)
=
(
u2k−1
u2k
)
. (13)
Let s˜ =
(
sodd
seven
)
denote the 2L × 1 input vector of
(permuted) modulation symbols in the factor graph of Fig. 1.
Since the interconnecting network between T and A performs
the permutation operation, we have
Q = Cs˜, (14)

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we employ the Forney-style factor graph to
design the optimal SFC MIMO OFDM receiver based on
forward-backward Gaussian message passing. The new deci-
sion rule derived in our work bridges over symbol detection
and error correction with its explicit expressions in mean
vectors and covariance matrices of modulation symbols. Near-
optimal detection with reduced complexity is shown to be
feasible by using the K-best algorithm in combination with
Cholesky decomposition.
