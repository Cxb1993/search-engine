 1 Introduction 
Uniform coverage is one of the major requirements of future cellular wireless systems (e.g., 
3GPP/LTE(-Advanced), IEEE 802.16m, etc.) [1-6]. Specifically, as the multimedia broadcast/multicast 
service (MBMS) is going to be a promising service of emerging systems for applications such as the 
real-time audio/video streaming to a group of users, each user should be equally served no matter where he is 
located, for instance, the cell-center and the cell-edge [7, 8]. Instead of the conventional multi-frequency 
network (MFN), the deployment of a single frequency network (SFN) is considered to be a key in network 
planning to achieve the uniform coverage. An SFN is a network consisting of several geographically 
distributed transmitters which send the same signal simultaneously over the same frequency band [9].  
 
 
Fig. 1. Configuration of an SFN. 
 
As illustrated by Figure 1, user equipment (UEs) will receive several echoes of the same signal 
transmitted from neighboring base stations (BSs) in the configuration of an SFN. These echoes of a desired 
signal can be seen as an effect of multipath propagation with various angles of arrival (AOA). Therefore, an 
UE may exploit the macro diversity from different BSs for improving the reception of the desired signal. For 
example, the frequency diversity gain can be achieved through channel decoding by an UE equipped with 
only one receive antenna because the constructive or destructive interferences among those echoes result in 
frequency selective fading channels. On the other hand, both the space and frequency diversity gains can be 
achieved by an UE equipped with multiple receive antennas through array beamforming and channel 
decoding. In addition, another benefit of an SFN is that UEs do not need to switch frequency while users 
wander in an SFN coverage. 
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission technique, a kind of multicarrier 
modulation scheme, has been increasingly popular for modern high-data-rate digital communications and 
broadcasting due to its extreme efficacy on dealing with the multipath propagation effects [10-12]. In OFDM 
systems, a guard interval (GI) is inserted at the beginning of each OFDM symbol to overcome the 
inter-symbol interference (ISI) as long as the maximum channel delay is smaller than the length of GI. The 
OFDM transmission scheme is very suitable to operate in an SFN, since the cyclic prefix (CP) is used as the 
 1
symbol period. Thus, the baseband discrete-time signal associated with the  OFDM symbol can be 
expressed as

For studying the issue of small delay spread, it is assumed that the maximum delay sample instant maxτ  
of the propagation channel from each BS is always smaller than or equal to . Moreover, let us assume 
that the propagation channel from each BS is static for the duration of at least one OFDM symbol. Under 
these assumptions, after removal of the GI, the received signal at an UE from the  BS can be expressed 
by

ISI/ICI occurs. However, if the channel delay is longer than the length of CP, we have both the ISI and the 
ICI, significantly reducing the system performance. This problem can be solved by increasing the CP size 
along with the useful symbol length (i.e., increasing the FFT size at the same sampling rate), in order to 
preserve throughput efficiency GI(N N N+ ) . However, this increases both the latency and the hardware 
complexity. In addition, to avoid ICI due to mobility, the channel should be invariant during the symbol 
period. Thus, a larger symbol period would render the system more sensitive to time-varying channels. 
Instead of increasing the CP size, a more effective and flexible method is needed for mitigating the 
interference problem in an SFN.

To fully exploit the potential benefits of an SFN for achieving the requirement of uniform coverage, it is 
greatly important to overcome the two outstanding issues mentioned above. This project is proposed to study 
in detail the two issues in a COFDM-SFN. It is therefore our objective to develop a framework in a 
COFDM-SFN that provides rich macro diversity and interference mitigation ability for solving the BSs edge 
problem and the large channel delay problem, respectively. 
 
3 Current Research Status 
Several macro diversity schemes based on distributed antennas or transmitters have been presented for 
solving the flat fading issue due to a small equivalent channel delay spread in OFDM systems. These 
diversity schemes include the trellis-based space-time codes [23-25], Alamouti’s space-time block coding 
(STBC) [26], the polarization diversity [28, 29], the cyclic delay diversity (CDD) [30-34], the Doppler 
diversity [35, 36] and the group-wise scrambling diversity (GSD) [37,38].  
Among these schemes, only the CDD, the Doppler diversity and the GSD introduce diversity without 
affecting the receiver design. The CDD technique artificially increases the frequency diversity by 
transmitting plural versions of the same signal from single/multiple BS(s) with different cyclic delays. The 
Doppler diversity technique increases the time diversity by transmitting plural versions of the same signal 
from single/multiple BS(s) with different symbol-by-symbol Doppler shifts. On the other hand, with a 
similar concept either as the CDD or as the Doppler diversity, a class of GSD techniques implemented in the

is the composite channel. It can be easily observed that the composite channel is now a randomly weighted 
sum of the channels between the UE and BSs for each subcarrier group. Consequently, as illustrated by 
Figure 6, the composite channel is thus divided into multiple groups with discontinuities and is no longer flat 
even if the individual channels from BSs to UE are flat. Therefore, frequency diversity is introduced across 
subcarrier groups. 
For coherent OFDM based systems, certain scattered pilots (SPs) regularly posited in time- and 
frequency-dimension (denoted by `p’ in Figure 6) are transmitted together with information data for receivers 
to perform channel estimation and equalization. No prior information about the phase rotation patterns is 
needed by receivers because the rotation phases are absorbed into the composite channel that can be 
estimated by SPs. However, discontinuities of composite channel responses inherent in the F-GSD scheme 
make channel estimation even more difficult (i.e., interpolation across subcarrier groups is forbidden) [40].

causing the reduced spectrum efficiency. This motivates our study of a more effective macro diversity 
scheme. 
 
4 The Proposed Approaches 
Figure 7 shows the process of the proposed correlated scrambling diversity (CSD) scheme. Defining 
scrambling symbol as the value determining rotation of each subcarrier, the scrambling pattern is the way that 
scrambling symbols are organized along the time- and frequency-dimension. In the proposed scheme, the 
scrambling symbols are correlated for contiguous subcarriers (frequency-dimension) and/or contiguous 
symbols (time-dimension). Corresponding to Figure 7, the CSD can be described as follows:

Fig. 8.  Linear interpolation channel estimation 
Recalling that CSD can increase frequency selectivity of the composite channel (refer to Eq. (18)). In 
order for accurate channel estimates through the linear interpolation approach, it’s expected that composite 
channel response is likely coherent between two contiguous pilot subcarriers. For the scrambling pattern 
generated with  given by Eq. (20), the coherent bandwidth of the composite channel is inversely 
proportional to 2d and can be given approximately by

parameter 2d such that the coherent bandwidth of the composite channel is greater than the interval between 
two contiguous pilots. In other words, the parameter 2d is designed for the trade-off between diversity and 
channel estimation accuracy. 
diversity gain to the system. Figure 11 shows the BLER curve of CSD and GSD using linear interpolation as 
the channel estimation scheme. It can bee seen that CSD outperforms GSD by 3.5 dB for BLER=10-2 when 
imperfect channel estimation effect is taken into account. 
For a more realistic channel model TU6 (typical urban 6-paths), the corresponding results using the 
same channel estimation scheme are shown in Figure 12. It can be seen that, for BLER=10-2, CSD 
outperforms GSD by 1.5 dB, and exhibits more than 2 dB gain compared to original system without any 
diversity scheme.

for range extension. However, the self-interference from the
transmitter to the receiver within a relay becomes a serious
problem especially for space-limited ROV and AUV. We hence
propose a hybrid-band relay based system for reduction of the
self-interference effect.
II. BACKGROUND ON EM WAVE PROPAGATION IN WATER
Maxwell’s equations can be used to theoretically predict
the propagation of EM waves traveling in water. A linearly
polarized plane EM wave propagating in the z direction may
be described in terms of the electric field strength Ex and the
magnetic field strength Hy with [3]
Ex = E0 exp(jωt−γz) (1)
Hy = H0 exp(jωt−γz) (2)
The propagation constant γ is expressed in terms of the
permittivity ε, permeability μ and conductivity σ by:
γ = jω
√
εμ− j σμ
ω
= α + jβ (3)
where α is the attenuation factor, β is the phase factor and
ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. The term εμ arises from the
displacement current and the term σμ/ω from the conduction
current. Usually, it is convenient to consider the solutions for
the conduction band (σ/ω > ε) and the dielectric band (ε >
σ/ω). A literature survey of EM wave propagation in waters
has shown that measurements of these parameters are rare.
Only a few investigations have been documented for horizontal
propagation over a short range between a transmitter and a
receiver.
In addition to the theoretical prediction provided by
Maxwell’s equations, two of Banos’ explicit formulas for
the radial component of the electric field are presented to
examine the propagation behavior of EM waves in water [5],
[6]. The experiments performed were designed by choice of
frequency and horizontal range to extend over the near-field
and intermediate-field formulas.

where
P1x : transmission power (W)
φ : angle bewteen the transmitter and receiver

r : distance bewteen the transmitter and receiver (m)
k1 : wavenumber in water
k2 : wavenumber in air
z : depth of submergence of the receiver (m)
z0 : depth of submergence of the transmitter (m)
Banos’ formulas are the bases for us to calculate the link
budget when system design is considered. As an example, one
should apply the near-field formula given by (4) for a trans-
mission within short ranges of a few meters in the UHF band.
According to (4), the average power density versus distance
for a 600 MHz EM wave propagating through the water was
calculated and plotted in Figure 1 with the parameters (P1x =
1 W, ε = 7.0376 × 10−10 F/m, φ = 0◦, z = z0 = 0.3 m).
Moreover, the associated pathloss (in dB) was summarized in
Table 1. As predicted from the dielectric theory, these results
verify that the attenuation is acceptable even when EM waves
are propagated through water. This motivates us to develop
a RF based underwater communication system. Nevertheless,
a large loss may occur if metal transmitting and receiving
antennas are directly contacted with waters as predicted from
the conduction band theory [4]. Therefore, for implementation
both the transmitting and receiving antennas should be coated
with an insulator to avoid the attenuation due to conduction
[1].

III. HYBRID-BAND UNDERWATER RELAY SYSTEM
A. System Architecture
According to the prediction on the pathloss shown in Table
1, a hybrid-band relay based analog/digital video transmis-
sion system is proposed from system design to hardware
implementation. Actually, the proposed system is a one-way
broadcasting system. By taking the EM wave transmission
properties of water into account, two radio frequency bands

C. OFDM Based Transmitter and Receiver
Rather than the low-cost FM scheme for analog video
transmission mentioned above, the OFDM scheme for digital
video transmission is more attractive due to the benefits of
digital communications such as noise immunity and error
correction ability. Theoretically, the digital video signals can
be transmitted over long distances if the signal is regenerated
along the way to restore the amplitude lost in the water
medium and to overcome the noise added in the process. The
simplified block diagrams of the OFDM based transmitter and
receiver are shown in Figure 6. To save the development time,
a digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) compliant 2K
mode specification is simply chosen for our implementation.
Total 2048 sub-carriers within a bandwidth of 8 MHz is used
along with robust QPSK modulation for the transmission of
digital MPEG-2 video with a data rate up to 5 Mbps (i.e.,
video quality for standard definition).
On the other hand, for the OFDM scheme, a relay consists of
an OFDM demodulator, a channel decoder/encoder (for error
correction) and an OFDM modulator. The block diagram of
the relay station is given by Figure 7.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Prototypes for a game of underwater battle of ROV (see
Figure 8) through remote-controlled operation have been de-
veloped using the proposed video transmission system. For
the FM scheme, the sensitivity of the developed receiver is

measured as −76 dBm for a subjective video quality. For the
OFDM scheme, the sensitivity of the developed receiver is
measured as −93 dBm for a quasi-error-free condition. The
experiments were performed in a large aquarium with live
fishes (see Figure 9). Experimental results associated with the
scenario shown in Figure 2 shows that, with frequency bands
and transmission power specified as follows:
• 700 MHz Band 1 = 630 MHz (Tx A → Rx B); 500 mW
• 700 MHz Band 2 = 730 MHz (Tx B → Rx C); 100 mW
• 2.4 GHz Band = 2,411 MHz (Tx C → Rx D); 10 mW
the video captured by an ROV can be transmitted through an
underwater distance of 2 ∼ 3 m with two underwater relays
and then received by a distant off-water controller. Although
the out-of-band spurious emissions have been limited to −50
dB relative to the carrier, it is remarked that a separation of
at least 100 MHz for the two 700 MHz bands is preferred for
acceptable self-interference in station B.
When the ROV were moving around, complete received
video was recorded. The photo of an instantaneous image on
the display is shown in Figure 10 for verifying the image
quality. This range of transmission is applicable for short-range
underwater entertainment and security. For further applications
of research/exploration in deep oceans, traditional cable-based
communications may be adopted as a complement to the
proposed system to achieve a long-range and partially-flexible
link.
V. CONCLUSION
A novel hybrid-band relay based analog/digital video trans-
mission (broadcasting) system has been proposed from system
design to hardware implementation. By taking the EM wave
transmission properties of water into account, 700 MHz-band
relays are used for underwater transmission range extension
and 2.4 GHz-band relays are used for off-water transmission
