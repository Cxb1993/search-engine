and Whitin [6] derived a constrained multi-item problem in a single period. Jucker 
and Rosenblatt [7] considered an unconstrained model with three types of quantity 
discounts: all-units quantity discount, incremental quantity discounts and Carload-lot 
discounts. Gerchak and Parlar [8] developed an unconstrained model in which the 
buyer decides on the price and the order policy. Lau and Lau [9] modeled a newsboy 
problem with price-dependent distribution demand. Khouja [10] developed a newsboy 
model in which multiple discounts are used to sell excess inventory. Khouja and 
Mehrez [11] extended Khouja’s model [10] to consider multi-items. Lau and Lau [12] 
derived a capacitated multiple-product single period inventory model. Pasternack [13] 
developed a capacitated single-item newsboy model with revenue sharing.  
GA (genetic algorithms) is a powerful tool to solve complex-structure problems 
with many variables. John Holland and his team applied their understanding of the 
adaptive processes of natural systems to design software for creating artificial systems 
that retained the robustness of natural systems (Holland [14]). During the last decade, 
GA, which is a search technique based on the mechanics of natural selection and 
natural genetics, has been commonly used to solve global optimization problems. 
Khouja, Michalewicz, and Wilmot [15], and Jinxing and Jiefang [16] studied the 
application of GA for solving lot-sizing problems. Mori and Tsen [17], and Li et al. 
[18] demonstrated that GA is effective for dealing with production planning and 
scheduling problems. Poulos et al. [19] derived a Pareto-optimal genetic algorithm for 
warehouse optimization. Zhou et al. [20] used GA to develop a warehouses and 
retailers network design. Aytug et al. [21] made a review of how genetic algorithms 
were used to solve production and operations management problems. Altiparmak et 
al. [22] designed a supply chain network to optimize joint total cost and service level 
by using GA.  
In this study, a single product replenished by multiple suppliers with different 
cost, quality and selling price is considered in a single order period with return policy. 
GA is used to derive a supplier selection and replenishment policy under limited 
budget and minimum service level. A mathematical modeling of a newsboy problem 
with various constraints is derived in section 2. After illustration of GA solution 
procedure (section 3), a numerical example and sensitivity analysis with various 
budgets, service level and number of trials are carried out in section 4. Section 5 
addresses the Pareto optimal solutions.  Two experiments to search the proper 
population size, mutation and crossover rates are conducted in section 6. The 
concluding remark is given in the last section. 
2  Mathematical modeling and analysis 
The model in this paper is developed on the basis of the following assumptions: 
(a) Single buyer and multiple suppliers are considered. Some suppliers offer outright 
price and some suppliers offer price with return policy.  
(b) A single item supplied by multiple suppliers has different levels of cost, quality 
and selling price.  
(c) The demand is uncertain with known probability density function. 
(d) An item with single order period, short selling season and long production 
Two sales priority rules are assumed. Rule 1: The items purchased with return 
policy begin selling only after the outright purchase items are sold. Rule 2: The items 
with higher defective rate begin selling only after lower defective rate. The expected 
sales revenue, SR can be expressed as

From (1) through (4), the expected profit, EP, is the sales revenue minus penalty 
cost, plus salvage value, minus shortage cost and purchase cost as follows: 
(f)  Mutation: About 30% of population mutation rate mutate new offspring at each 
locus (position in the chromosome). Accordingly, the offspring might have 
genetic material information not inherited from either parent, thus avoiding 
falling into the local optimum. 
(g)  Replacement: An elitist strategy and a steady-state evolution are used to 
generate a new population, which can be used for an additional algorithm run. 
(h)  Termination: If the number of trials exceeds 1,000,000 (or 5,000,000), then stop; 
otherwise go to (b). 
4  Numerical example 
The newsboy model for a buyer with uncertain demand and multiple suppliers is 
depicted in Figure 1. The related data are assumed as follows: limited budget 
T≤$2,000, minimal service level S.L.≥0.9, demand with uniform probability density 
function )250,100()( Uxf = , shortage cost for each shortage unit 20$=S , penalty cost 
for each defective unit 20$=g and the other known parameters, Pi, Ci, Ri and di, are 
listed in Table 1. Four cases are designed for various combinations of Qi.  
Using genetic algorithm, the evolutionary results of decision variables Qi for Case 
1-4 are also shown in Table 1. In Case 1, the solution is {Q1=118 units, Q2=0 unit, 
Q3=0 unit and Q4=117 units} because price P1 is much greater than price P2, cost C4 
is less than C3, return price R4 is greater than R3, and the minimal service level must 
be met. Both the budget and service level constraints are active. In Case 2, the 
solution is {Q1=0 unit, Q2=150 units, Q3=50 units and Q4=35 units} because price P2 
is much greater than P1, price P3 greater than P4. Both the budget and service-level 
constraints are active. In this case, there is budget leftover of ($2,000-$1,995=$5) 
because the budget left is smaller than the integral unit of Qi. In Case 3, the solution is 
{Q1=1 unit, Q2=86 units, Q3=49 units and Q4=100 units}. All Q1 through Q4 are 
ordered since the price difference between the suppliers is not obvious. Both the 
budget and service level constraints are non-active. In Case 4, the solution is {Q1=0 
unit, Q2=0 unit, Q3=0 unit and Q4=239 units}. Only Q4 is ordered mainly because 
1234 PPPP <<< . Both the budget and service-level constraints are non-active.  
Let the evolutionary number of trials be set at 10,000, 100,000, 500,000, 
1,000,000 and 5,000,000. Run five times for each trial number, one can derive the 
best expected profit and the standard deviation of expected profit. The relationship 
between the best expected profit and the trial numbers is depicted in Figure 2 for the 
four cases. The relationship between the standard deviation of expected profit and the 
trial numbers is shown in Figure 3 for the four cases. It shows that the expected profit 
increases with the number of trials, and the standard deviation of expected profit 
decreases with the number of trials. 
The sensitivity analysis is carried out when the available budget or the required 
minimum service level is changed in the following scenarios: {T≤$2,200 and 
S.L.≥0.9}, {T≤$1,800 and S.L.≥0.9}, {T≤$2,000 and S.L.≥0.92} and {T≤$2,000 and 
S.L.≥0.88}. The evolutionary results are shown in Table 2-3. 
return-policy purchase quantity tends to increase when the available budget decreases 
or the required service level increases. The numerical analysis is carried out using 
genetic algorithms.

Abstract— One of the keys to successful e-business is the integration of the vendor-buyer inventory system. 
Many researches have studied the integrated inventory system by assuming perfect quality. This paper 
develops an optimal integrated lot size and inspection schedule for an imperfect product. It is assumed that 
a production process is subject to a random deterioration from the in-control state to the out-of-control state 
and, thus, produces some proportion of defective items. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis are 
carried out to show the worth considering the imperfect quality to derive an inspection schedule. 
 
Key words: integration, inspection schedule, deterioration production process
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Due to global competition, limited resources and shortened product life cycles, 
much attention has been given to joint cost improvement through the integration of 
the vendor and the buyer inventory system. Clark and Scarf [2] consider the design

Since the demand rate is deterministic, the right side of (8) is a constant value depending solely on 
vendor’s related known information. For any real number, n, the economic production quantity is 
constant for any imperfect production process.  
 
III. SOLUTION PROCEDURE 
The problem is to determine the value of n and Q that minimizes the integrated 
total cost function (6). Since the number of deliveries and inspections, n, is a discrete 
variable, one can derive the values of n and Q by the following procedure: 
(a) For a range of n values, derive the optimal value of Q by taking the derivatives of 
TC with respect to Q and set it to zero. 
(b) Derive the optimal values of n and Q, denoted by and , such that *n *Q

ξn and are the solutions with a perfect production process. ξQ
ξTC is the integrated total cost for and values. ξn ξQ
*TC is the optimal solution with imperfect production process. 
 
V. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
For the numerical example given above, we have found the optimal value of n, Q 
and TC for a fixed set of parameters φ = { μ , Cd, Pd, Ci, Cr}. We then consider the 
changes in the optimal values of n, Q and TC when the parameters inφ  are changed.  
In the following analysis, we find the optimal values of n, Q and TC when only one of 
the parameters in the set φ  increases or decreases by 20% while all other parameters 
remain unchanged. The results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. The main 
conditions drawn from the sensitivity analysis are as follows: 
(1) The PICR value is most sensitive when Cd and Pd increase or when Ci decreases. 
(2) The range of PICR is from 2.53% to 15.54%. The average value of PICR is about 
9.4%. 
(3) When Cd or Pd increases, the PICR increases due to more serious imperfect 
production process. 
(4) When μ  increases, the PICR decreases due to less imperfect quality problem. 
(5) When Ci and Cr increase, the delivery quantity increases, therefore the PICR 
decreases. 
 
When Ci or Cr increases, the optimal number of deliveries and inspections 
decreases to counteract the effect of inspection and restoration costs. When the mean 
time before deterioration decreases, increases to counteract the annual cost 
incurred from defective items. The sensitivity analysis when 
*n
μ and Ci are changed 
simultaneously is shown in Table 2. One can see from Table 2 that when increases, 
the value of decreases, which is consistent to (8). In the case when 
*n
*Q μ = 80 and Ci 
= 1, the process is nearly perfect, such that it is the same as the case for perfect 
product where Ci = 0, Cr = 0 and Cd = 0. 
When and are changed simultaneously, the result of sensitivity analysis are 
shown in Table 3. Comparing Table 2 with Table 3, one can see that the effect of 
increasing the parameter C
dC rC
d or decreasing the parameter μ is similar, and the effect of 
increasing the parameter Cr or Ci is similar.
