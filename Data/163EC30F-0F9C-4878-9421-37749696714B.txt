Abstract 
 
 In recent years, micro spacecrafts have been considered as the next logical step 
in the evolution of capable, low-cost spacecraft systems. Since these spacecrafts are 
very small in size and weight, they pose unique engineering challenges. Li et al. 
(2001) has proposed a MEMS actuator (called pseudo-wheel) for an attitude 
stabilization of a spacecraft. This actuator comprises of four small beams, and each 
beam is made up of electro-thermal materials. If the MENS devices are individually 
installed on each principal axis of the micro spacecraft, by switching on or off the 
input voltage to yield the deformation of the beams, the attitude of the spacecraft can 
be accomplished. The main goal of the research project is to precisely model, analysis, 
simulate, and control the attitude motion of the micro spacecraft by using the MENS 
device in order to verify the proposed approach. This report is divided into two parts. 
The first part studies the kineto-dynamics of the MEMS actuator, and the second part 
proposes the attitude control of miniature spacecraft based on the analysis results of 
the first part.  
 
Keywords: miniature spacecraft; attitude dynamics and control; pseudowheel.

pseudo-wheel attached to a micro spacecraft. Although the proposed model is highly 
nonlinear, and the flexible and rigid body motions are coupled, it can be solved by the 
assumed mode method and the finite element method. To obtain dynamic responses, it 
is necessary to perform numerical integration. However, it is time-consuming, and the 
solution accuracy depends on the number of modes for the assumed mode method and 
the number of elements for the finite element method. Therefore, for application 
purpose, it is important to study the kineto-elasto-dynamics of the pseudo-wheel. 
 This report is organized as follows. First of all, a nonlinear dynamic model of a 
piezo-actuator is derived. Secondly, the nonlinear dynamic model of the 
pseudo-actuator is simplified as a static model, which is verified by comparing with 
some literature results. Thirdly, the proposed dynamic model is analyzed. Finally, 
some conclusions follow.  
 
2. Modeling of a piezo-actuator 
 A pseudo-wheel is simplified as a hub attached with a bimorph, called a 
piezo-actuator shown in Fig 3. The hub is assumed as a rigid body, and the bimorph is 
considered as a beam made of piezoelectric materials. Three coordinate systems are 
defined in Fig 3, where the pair ),( 00 ZX  represents the reference coordinates, 
),( 11 ZX  are the bimorph body-fixed coordinates, and ),( 22 ZX  are the bimorph 
element coordinates. The hub-bimorph has a rigid body rotating angle with respect to 
the reference coordinate 0X . The modeling of the bimorph is based on 
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The deformation of the bimorph includes the 
longitudinal and transverse displacements. Also, the rigid body rotation of the 
hub-bimorph is excited by the vibration of the bimorph. Therefore, the position, 
velocity, and acceleration vectors of any point on the bimorph with respect to the 
bimorph-fixed coordinate system ),( 11 ZX  are respectively given as

variables associated with the assumed modes for the AMM or nodal variables for the 
FEM.

4. Dynamic analysis of the piezo-actuator 
 The transverse displacement and the rigid body rotation of the bimorph are 
assumed as small variations. By neglecting the nonlinear terms in Eq.

 Based on the above equations, the natural frequencies of the piezo-actuator are 
shown in Table 2. The piezo-actuator includes a longitudinal motion, a transverse 
motion, and a rigid body rotation. The natural frequency of the rigid body rotation is 
zeros. Thus, Table 2 lists the natural frequencies of the longitudinal and transverse 
modes by using the AMM and the FEM. The natural frequencies of the longitudinal 
modes are higher than those of the first four transverse modes. Thus, it is expected 
that the transverse modes would mainly dominate the motion of the pizeo-actuator. To

 A constant voltage 100 Volt is applied to the bimorph, and it produces 
longitudinal and transverse deformations as well as the rigid body rotation of the hub. 
Fig 8 to 11 show the dynamic responses of the tip longitudinal displacement, the tip 
transverse displacement, the rotating angle of the hub, and the torque generated by the 
bimorph, respectively. There are five cases in these figures. The first two cases are the 
AMM; the first and fourth cases are the FEM; the last case is a reference solution by 
using the FEM with a ten-element discretization. To compare these five cases, the 
responses of the tip transverse displacement shows that case 4 provide an excellent 
agreement with the reference solution; the tip longitudinal displacement and the 
rotating angle of the hub does not show much differences; the torque generated by the 
bimorph has slight differences before 0.01 seconds. To examine the steady state 
values of these figures, the tip longitudinal displacement and the torque are zeros, but 
the transverse motion of the bimorph generates a rigid body rotation of the hub. Thus, 
the voltage applied to the bimorph can be used as a control signal to regulate the 
motion of the hub.

5. Summary for Part I 
 This paper presents elasto-dynamic studies of a piezo-actuator, which can be 
applied to attitude stabilization and control of micro spacecraft. The piezo-actuator is 
designed as a hub attached with a bimorph. Although there are numerous researches 
related to this model, it is limited number of literatures to analyze its 
kineto-elasto-dynamics. The proposed model is highly nonlinear but can be solved by 
the finite element method and the assumed mode method. An applied voltage excites 
the flexible deformation of the bimorph, which includes the longitudinal and 
transverse displacements. Also, the flexible deformation yields the rotating angle of 
the hub, which can be attached on a micro spacecraft to perform attitude control. 
Since the model highly nonlinear and the flexible and rigid body motions are coupled, 
it is time-consuming to obtain dynamic responses by numerical integration. Also, the 
computing time depends on the number of modes for the assumed mode method or 
the number of elements for the finite element method. To validate the proposed model, 
it is simplified as a static bimorph, and the deflection results are compared with some 
literatures. The results show that the proposed model solved by the finite element 
method can provide more accurate solutions. To examine the nature frequencies, the 
assumed mode method can provide more accurate solutions than the finite element 
method. However, to examine the response of the tip deflection, the finite element 
method employing quintic shape functions can provide more accurate solutions.

applied voltages, which are limited by the specifications of voltage amplifiers, and 
this paper demonstrates how to meet the requirements; (4) The attitude error caused 
by the gravity gradient torques is compensated by a closed-loop attitude control 
strategy. This paper is organized as follows: the attitude control strategy is presented 
in Sec 7, and the equations of motion of the spacecraft-pseudowheel system are 
derived in Sec 8; the implementation of the attitude control strategy is summarized in 
Sec 9, and some examples are demonstrated in Sec 10; some conclusions are 
presented in Sec 11.

7. Attitude control strategy of rotation sequences 
 An attitude control actuator, called a pseduwheel, is illustrated in Fig 12, and the 
attitude reorientation of spacecraft can be performed by mounting pseudowheels on 
each principal axis of spacecraft shown in Fig 13, where 1ˆe , 2eˆ  and 3eˆ  are the unit 
vectors along the three body-fixed principal axes. There are two limitations to fulfill 
the achievement of attitude control. One is that activation and deactivation should be 
applied at different times, and the other is that the pseudowheel cannot perform a

where [Rs] is a desired rotation matrix to represent the spacecraft attitude reorientation, 
which can be expressed in terms of the Euler angles 1, 2 and 3; [Rw] is the rotation 
matrix caused by the rotation sequence of the pseudowwheels, and the angle of each 
rotation is 1, 2 or 3. For instance, if the rotation sequence (1,2,3,-1,-2,-3) is selected, 
the rotation matrix [Rw] can be written as

 Eqs. (40) and (41) represent a set of nine nonlinear equations in terms of three 
unknowns, which are the three rotation angles 1, 2 or 3 on the three axes. Although 
the set of equations also implies that there are six orthonormality constraints, they are 
always satisfied no matter what values the three unknowns are. Thus, Eqs. (40) and 
(41) still represent a set of nine over-constrained nonlinear algebraic equations, and it 
can be solved by using the Newton-Raphson method as

where X is a column vector in terms of the three unknown rotation angles of 
pseudowheels, and X0 is an initial guess; {Fs} and {Fw} are the column vectors in 
terms of the nine components in the rotation matrices of spacecraft and pseudowheels, 
respectively;   is a gradient operator. It is noted that }{ WF  is a 93 matrix, and 
its inverse matrix can be obtained by using the pseudo inverse, which is based the 
least-square method. Thus, even though a solution is found by using Eq. (42), the 
solution might not totally satisfy the nine nonlinear equations. 
 To illustrate the attitude control strategy, one considers an optimization problem 
which is to minimize the actuating energy in order to find a rotation sequence. Thus, a 
pseudo actuating energy is selected as an objective function, which is defined as

8. Formulation of equations of motion 
 Based on the aforementioned attitude control strategy, there is only one axis 
performing a rotation during the same time, so the equations of motion for a single 
axis can be individually derived. A simplified single-axis spacecraft-pseudowheel 
system is shown in Fig 16, where the spacecraft is considered as a rigid body, and a 
pseudowheel consists of multiple piezoelectric bimorphs. When an external voltage is 
applied to the bimorph, it would bend and the spacecraft produces a counter-direction 
rotation due to the conservation of angular momentum. To derive the equations of 
motion, the kinetic energy can be written as

 Solving Eqs. (47)-(54), a three-axis attitude motion of spacecraft actuated by the 
pseudowheels on the three axes can be obtained. In order to determine the relationship 
between the rotating angle and the applied voltages to the bimorph, Eqs. (47) and (48) 
can be reduced as

where the subscript ss represents the steady state. Eq. (56) shows the applied voltage 
is proportional to the rotation angle. Also, the rotation angle can increase if the 
number of bimorphs increases, but the rotation angle approaches a certain value as the 
number of bimorphs goes to the infinity. 
 
Example 7.1: Single-axis dynamic simulation 
 A pseudowheel consists of eight bimorphs, which are made of PZT materials, so 
the Young's modulus is 84 GN/m2, the piezoelectric constant is 8.4425 C/m2, and the 
mass density is 7266 Kg/m3. Also, the length, width and thickness of the bimorph are 
500, 25 and 0.5 mm, respectively. The distance from the mass center of spacecraft to 
the left end of the bimorph (see Fig 16) is 50 mm. The moments of inertia of the 
spacecraft and the bimorph are the same. The equations of motion are solved by using 
the four-mode assumed mode method, and the applied voltage is 500 volt. Thus, a 
single-axis motion is shown in Fig 17, and the steady state rotating angle is -9.8112 
degrees based on Eq. (55). Examining the figure, the system needs around 10 seconds 
to reach the steady state. Therefore, when the attitude control strategy is applied to the 
spacecraft-bimorph model, the time for each rotation sequence can be set as 10 
seconds.

Example 10.1: Three-axis dynamic simulation 
 An initial attitude of a spacecraft is given as an Euler angle 3-2-1 sequences (10, 
10, 10). One intends to find the rotation sequence which can drive the spacecraft 
attitude back to zero degrees. The rotation sequence (2,-3,1,-2,3,-1) is selected, 
because it has the minimum actuating energy which has been demonstrated in 
Example 7.1. Using the spacecraft-pesudowheel model, the time responses of the 
Euler angles are shown in Fig 19(a). The results show that the transient responses 
appear at each rotation, and the final attitude reaches zeros degrees. Fig 19(b) shows 
the applied voltages of the pseudowheels on the three principal axes. This figure 
shows that the applied voltages are 802, 1487 and 1350 volts on the three axes of the 
pseudowheels, the pseudo actuating energy is 0.5473 rad2, and the maneuver time is 
60 seconds.

Example 10.2: Implementation of a three-set three-axis rotation sequence 
 Example 7.1 demonstrates that not every rotation sequence can reach the desired 
attitude of spacecraft. After performing all 264 rotation sequences based on the 
three-set rotations, all of them can have a solution to achieve the attitude maneuver, 
and the solution with the minimum actuating energy is the rotation sequence 
(3,-1,2,-3,1,-2), and the pseudo actuating energy based on Eq. (42) is 0.5233 rad2. The 
time responses of the Euler angles are shown in Fig 20(a), and the applied voltages of 
the pseudowheels on the three principal axes are shown in Fig 20(b), where the time 
duration between two successive vertical dash lines represents a one-set maneuver. 
The results show that the three applied voltages to the same principal axis is not 
exactly the same, the maximum voltage is 841 volts, and the maneuver time is 180 
seconds.

10.2 Reductions of the applied voltages to the pseudowheels  
 The maximum applied voltage to the bimorphs usually depends on the 
specifications of voltage amplifiers. Examining the previous cases, all applied 
voltages are greater than 500 volts, and this yields the implementation difficulties. 
One option to solve this problem is to apply multiple steps of rotation sequences, and 
each step will execute a small attitude change. This approach can reduce the applied 
voltages, but the maneuver time will increase. The concept is the same as the previous 
cases presented in Sec 10.1, and the only difference is that the applied voltages for 
each step are the same. The meanings of set and step should be clarified in this paper. 
A set refers to repeated rotation sequences with different applied voltages, and a step 
represents repeated rotation sequences with the same set of the applied voltages. 
 
Example 10.4: Implementation of multiple-step single-set rotation sequence 
 One still considers the case that the Euler angles 3-2-1 initiated at (10, 10, 10) 
would be driven back to zeros degrees. Since the rotation sequence (2,-3,1,-2,3,-1) 
have a minimum actuating energy, this case still selects this sequence. In order to 
make the applied voltages less than 500 volts, seven steps of single-set rotation 
sequences are specified. The time responses of the Euler angles are shown in Fig 
22(a), and the applied voltages are shown in Fig 22(b). The results show that it takes 
420 seconds to complete the attitude maneuver. The applied voltages on the three 
principal axes are 413, 469 and 484 volts, and the pseudo actuating energy is 0.5117 
rad2, which is smaller than that of using a single-step single-set rotation sequence.

two successive dash lines represents a one-cycle attitude maneuver. To compare with 
Example 10.5, the results show that it takes three closed-loop cycles for the Euler 
angles to reach zero degrees. Thus, the maneuver time is the same, but the pseudo 
actuating energy is 0.7982. Examining the applied voltages, they reach the maximum 
value 500 volts during the first cycle, but they are below the maximum value during 
the third cycle.

11. Summary for Part II 
 This paper presents the attitude control of miniature spacecraft by using the 
pseudowheels, which are mounted on the three principal axes of spacecraft. The 
pseudowheels compose of multiple bimorphs, whose vibrations are exited by applied 
voltages. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the spacecraft attitude can be 
driven by the pseudowheels. By applying a rotation sequence, the attitude maneuver 
can be completed. This paper proposes open- and closed-loop attitude control 
strategies. Since there are some limitations about the implementations of the strategies, 
such as some rotation sequences without solutions, the limits of the maximum applied 
voltages, and the effect of the disturbance torques, this paper presents several 
examples to demonstrate how to eliminate the limitations. The results show that the 
open-loop control strategy can accurately reach the desired attitude if there are no 
disturbance torques. Also, the applied voltages can be reduced to meet the 
specifications of voltage amplifiers. The closed-loop attitude control strategy 
demonstrates the systems with the constrained applied voltages. Also, the strategy can 
compensate the attitude error caused by the effect of the gravity gradient torques.
