Effects of p+ layer and its contact electrode on the electrical characteristics of p-i-n solar cell 
have been studied. The short-circuit current would be increased with the reduced thickness of p+ 
layer, due to less optical absorption in the heavily doped p+ region. However, a thinner p+ layer 
may form a smaller series resistance and thus a larger dark current of the p-i-n structure. As a 
result, for the p+ layer of 0.1 Âµm here, the open-circuit voltage is degraded, relative to a thicker 
p+ layer. The p+ layer of 0.1 Âµm thickness can still achieve a relatively larger conversion 
efficiency, attributable to a larger short-circuit current. On the other hand, for the ITO electrode, 
the short-circuit current would just be slightly increased with the reduced width of contact 
electrode, due to less area of optical absorption. However, the contact electrode of 0.05 Âµm 
width causes a smaller short-circuit current than that of 0.1 Âµm width, due to a smaller carrier 
collection area. As a result, the contact electrode of 0.1 Âµm width can achieve a relatively large 
value of the open-circuit voltage and the maximum conversion efficiency.

The price of petroleum is getting higher in this century, a new energy is needed. Because solar 
energy is clean and almost unlimited, it is considered as a good substitute energy. Several 
technology in fabricating solar cell have been previously developed [1-7]. Polycrystalline or 
multi-crystalline silicon solar cells have become a strong contender for terrestrial applications [8]. 
In recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the quality of the polycrystalline 
silicon substrates. The effective minority carrier diffusion length has increased from 80~100 Âµm 
to 150~200 Âµm. However, due to the presence of grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries, and 
impurities, there remains a substantial gap in the efficiency of polycrystalline silicon solar cells 
when compared with that of single crystalline cells [9-10]. 
An internal electric field is needed to separate carriers more efficiently, and thus the p-i-n 
structure was usually applied in the device structure of solar cells. In addition, the top emitter 
layer of either heavily-doped n+ or p+ layer would considerably absorb the incident light. Hence, 
a thin top emitter layer may generally be expected for increasing the short-circuit current. 
However, the open-circuit voltage and the short-curcuit current may also be substantially 
affected by the emitter layer and also its contact electrode. 
  In this study, effects of p+ emitter layer and its contact electrode on the electrical output 
characteristics of p-i-n solar cell have been studied. The i-layer and the p+ layer of various 
thickness have been conducted. In addition, contact electrode of various size and material has 
been examined.

  A typical process flow was firstly described below. Figure 1 shows the resultant structure of 
the p-i-n solar cell. The n+ poly-Si layer was heavily doped with 1Ã—1019 cm-3, and the n-type

For the Al electrode, the open-circuit voltage shows a slight decrease with increasing the width 
of contact electrode, due to the reduced short-circuit current. For the ITO electrode, the 
open-circuit voltage still shows a slight decrease with increasing the width of contact electrode. 
In addition, the contact electrode of 0.05 Âµm width would cause a smaller open-circuit voltage 
than that of 0.1 Âµm width, due to a smaller short-circuit current. On the other hand, Fig. 7 shows 
the dependence of maximum conversion efficiency on the width of contact electrode for the Al 
and the ITO electrode, correspondingly, and a p+ layer of 0.1 Âµm thickness. Hence, the contact 
electrode of 0.1 Âµm width can achieve a larger value of the maximum conversion efficiency, due 
to a larger short-circuit current and a larger open-circuit voltage.

    Effects of p+ layer and its contact electrode on the electrical characteristics of p-i-n solar 
cell have been studied. The short circuit current would be increased with the reduced thickness of 
p+ layer, due to less optical absorption in the heavily doped p+ region. However, a thinner p+ 
layer may form a smaller series resistance for the dark current of the p-i-n structure. As a result, 
the open-circuit voltage does not show considerable variation with the p+ layer thicker than 0.2 
Âµm here. Moreover, for the p+ layer of 0.1 Âµm, the open-circuit voltage is obviously degraded 
due to a small series resistance and thus a large dark current. In terms of the maximum 
conversion efficiency, the p+ layer of 0.1 Âµm thickness can still achieve a relatively larger 
efficiency, attributable to a larger short-circuit current. On the other hand, for the ITO electrode, 
the short-circuit current would just be slightly increased with the reduced width of contact 
electrode, due to less area of optical absorption. However, the contact electrode of 0.05 Âµm width 
causes a smaller short-circuit current than that of 0.1 Âµm width, due to a smaller carrier 
collection area. In addition, the resultant open-circuit voltage exhibits a similar trend as the 
short-circuit current. As a result, the contact electrode of 0.1 Âµm width can achieve a relatively 
large value of the maximum conversion efficiency, due to a larger short-circuit current and a 
larger open-circuit voltage.
