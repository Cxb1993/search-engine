Abstract
Ubiquinone-10 (CoQ10) production was performed in a submerged fermenter through the culture of a facultative bacterium-Rhodobacter
sphaeroides. Effects of the aerobic-dark cultivation under different dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and the anaerobic-light cultivation ofR. sphaeroides
on CoQ10 production were investigated. In the aerobic-dark cultivation, four levels of dissolved oxygen at 60 ± 5%, 30 ± 5%, 10 ± 5% and 0%
controlled by the agitation adjustment were performed. The results showed that the anaerobic-light cultivation had a higher CoQ10 concentration
of 18.2 g/L over all the aerobic-dark batches. Among the batches of aerobic-dark cultivation, the maximum CoQ10 concentration of 10.5 mg/L was
observed in the cultivation at 0% dissolved oxygen. The anaerobic-light cultivation (18.2 g/L) had more than 70% increased of CoQ10 concentration
as compared to the maximum CoQ10 concentration obtained from the aerobic-dark cultivation at 0% DO (10.5 g/L). However, a much longer lag
phase in the anaerobic-light batch led to a lower overall CoQ10 production rate (0.095 mg/L/h) as compared to the value of 0.146 mg/L/h in the
batch of aerobic-dark at 0% DO. Except for the long fermentation period, the high energy consumption required from the light irradiation in
the anaerobic-light batch led the anaerobic-light cultivation for CoQ10 production economically uncompetitive. Therefore, the cultivation of R.
sphaeroides under the situation of aerobic-dark at 0% DO was suggested to be applied in the scale-up CoQ10 production.

1. Introduction
Ubiquinone-10 (also called CoQ10) is a common material
found in animals, plants and microorganisms as a coenzyme
involved in the biological reactions. The chemical structure of
CoQ10 is 2.3-dimethoxy-methyl-benzoquinone with a side chain
of 10 monosaturated isoprenoid units. This compound is used
as an essential component of ATP generation in the respira-
tory chains of mitochondria responsible for the electron transfer
[1]. Some researchers reported the excellent therapeutic effects
of CoQ10 on heart disease and Parkinson’s disease [2]. It was
also recommend as a health supplement to patients who were
taking statin drugs for cholesterol control and to decrease the
occurrence of heart attack and stroke. The pharmacological
target of statin drugs is on the enzyme called hydroxyl-methyl-
glutaryl (HMG) Co-A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for
the metabolic pathway of cholesterol formation and CoQ10

synthesis. In turn, an unintended consequence of HMG-Co-A
reductase inhibition may result in the lowering of CoQ10 levels
[3]. The production of CoQ10 can be either through chemical
synthesis, semi-chemical synthesis or microbial conversion [4].
Many different microorganisms have been reported to be capa-
ble of producing CoQ10, such as Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium,
Rhodobacter and Paracoccus [5]. Among that, Pseudomonas
had been tested the ability of producing CoQ10 and identified
the effects of different medium components adding and control
strategies to CoQ10 production. It was reported that intermittent
feeding of glucose to the culture medium during the cultivation
could increase the cell yield and enhance CoQ10 formation by
Pseudomonas [6]. The effects of adding different amino acids
to CoQ10 production had also been investigated in detailed [6].
The study of dissolved oxygen effects on CoQ10 production in
Paracoccus denitriﬁcans led to the conclusion that a lower con-
centration of oxygen in the inlet gas (as low as 2.5%) would
have a higher CoQ10 production [7]. Sakato et al. [8] suggested
that CoQ10 production was enhanced under microaerobic dark
cultivation ofRhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (formerly known
Rhodobacter sphaeroides), which was the aerobic culture with

DO level batch achieved a higher CoQ10 concentration (high
DO > middle DO > low DO). However, if the aerobic-dark batch
had a zero DO level, a value of 10.5 mg/L CoQ10 concentra-
tion was obtained, which was the highest CoQ10 concentration
among all aerobic-dark batches. If the cultivation environment
was in the anaerobic-light, as high as 18.2 mg/L CoQ10 con-
centration was acquired at the 204th hour time point, a more
than 70% increase as compared to the aerobic-dark batch at
0% DO. These results suggested that from the viewpoint of
maximum CoQ10 concentration obtained, the anaerobic-light
cultivation of R. sphaeroides was the preferred method and the
cultivation of aerobic-dark at 0% DO level would be the next
choice.
On the cell growth measurement, the aerobic-dark batches
had a similar maximum cell concentration in the range of
1.2–1.4 g/L (Fig. 2). As compared to the cell concentration of
0.8 g/L obtained from the batch of anaerobic-light, oxygen did
really enhance the cell growth. Except for the difference of the
maximum cell concentration, the effects of oxygen on the spe-
cific growth rate of the exponential phase were observed. The
specific growth rates of the exponential phase for non-zero DO
batches in the aerobic-dark cultivation had a similar value of
0.11 (g/g/h). However, as low as 0.01 (g/g/h) of specific growth
rate in the batch of anaerobic-light cultivation was acquired. A
quite longer lag phase in the anaerobic-light cultivation than
in the batches of aerobic-dark cultivation was noted. The lag
phase in the anaerobic-light batch was about 100 h as compared
to 24 h lag phase in the aerobic-dark batches. These results
suggested that for a facultative microorganism the aerobic-
dark culture had a better environment for the cell growth than
the anaerobic-light environment, especially at the beginning of

growth phase. This could be observed from a shorter lag phase
existing in all aerobic-dark batches than in the anaerobic-light
batch.
The glucose consumption curves showed a similar decrease
pattern among all aerobic-dark cultures at different DO levels
(Fig. 3). However, the anaerobic-light batch had a lower glucose
consumption rate as compared to the aerobic-dark batches. The
average glucose consumption rate was 0.15 (g/L/h) in the batches
of aerobic-dark and 0.03 (g/L/h) in the batch of anaerobic-light.
A lower glucose consumption rate in the anaerobic-light batch
corresponded to the lower specific growth rate and a lower final
biomass.
As shown in Table 1, the maximum CoQ10 concentra-
tion (18.2 mg/L) and the maximum CoQ10 production yield
(21.3 mg CoQ10/g DCW) were obtained from the batch of
anaerobic-light cultivation, which were 1.73 times and 2.66
times, respectively, to the values obtained in the zero DO
batch of aerobic-dark cultivation (10.5 mg/L and 8 mg CoQ10/g
DCW, respectively). Even lower CoQ10 production yields were
found from other aerobic-dark batches. The lower CoQ10 pro-
duction yields in the aerobic-dark batches suggested that the
anaerobic-light environment could enhance the CoQ10 produced
by R. Sphaeroides cultivation than the aerobic-dark environ-
ment. According to the time course results of CoQ10 production
(Fig. 1) and cell mass production (Fig. 2), the formation of
CoQ10 was a growth-related product (possibly clarified as a
primary metabolite), which indicated that CoQ10 biosynthesis
from R. sphaeroides occurred predominantly during the expo-
nential growth phase Therefore, the aerobic-dark batch with
zero DO and the anaerobic-light batch, both showed slower
