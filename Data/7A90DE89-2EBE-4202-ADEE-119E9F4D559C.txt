Abstract
3D display has become the mainstream because of the development of display technology. The
technology of the 3D display is novel. The ambient surrounding when watching 3D displays and the
content of the 3D image were the major factors which affected the visual quality on viewers, and they
might increase viewer’s mental and physical loading. As a result, it was a vital problem how to 
increase the viewer’s comfort on 3D displays.
This project aimed to conduct a human factors experiment through the tools of design of
experiment (DOE) in the multi-view stereoscopic display. The study was intended to analyze the major
factors which may influence the quality of the static picture and the dynamic film. Based on the
subjective and objective image quality assessment and physiological indicators, the root cause of the
decreasing image quality and visual fatigue for viewers when watching stereo displays were found.
At the first, the literature of the factor of image quality pertaining to the stereoscopic display was
collected. The static picture on 3D display was studied in the first stage experiment. The experiment
studied the effect of convergence distance and ambient illumination on visual fatigue, visual comfort
assessment, and perceived depth. The results showed significant interaction effect between ambient
illumination and convergence distance on psychophysical visual fatigue. Furthermore, there existed
significant simple main effects of ambient illumination and convergence distance. The significant main
effect of ambient illumination on depth and coordination in terms of visual comfort assessment was
also obtained. Moreover, the difference of convergence distance was divided into two groups with the
impression of 3D presence, convex and concave. The outcome revealed that the impression of 3D
presence significantly affected perceived depth and two groups were analyzed by regression
respectively to get the fitting line between convergence distance and perceived depth.
The follow up experiment for the dynamic film was implemented in the second stage of
experiment. The effect of velocity, binocular disparity, and brightness contrast ratio on subjective and
objective visual fatigues was studied. The result showed that a statistically significant interaction effect
between moving velocity and disparity on objective visual fatigue was obtained. The interaction effect
between disparity and brightness contrast ratio on focusing difficulty in terms of subjective comfort
evaluation was also yielded. Velocity was significant on eye strain and focusing difficulty in terms of
subjective comfort evaluation. Moreover, the best combination levels of the significant variables in the
dynamic film were obtained.

2separates them by the operation of LC shutter with proper timing; the polarized glasses allocates the
left-eye/right-eye image in a single frame and divides them with orthogonal polarization (Choi, 2011).
Nevertheless, the prolonged use of LC shutter glasses and polarized glasses are widely reported to
cause headaches because people could not get used to wearing any special viewing gear (Lipton, 1982).
Therefore, autostereoscopic displays are created to provide 3D perception without the need for special
glasses or other user-worn devices (Dodgson, 2005). Developers use three broad classes, which are
spatial multiplex, multiprojector, and time-sequential, of technology to make autosteroscopic displays
(Dodgson, 2005). Spatial multiplex works by interleaving the left and right images in vertical strips. A
parallax barrier or lenticular screen is then placed in front of the picture so that the viewer sees only
the respective views of the stereogram. In addition, the image does not reveal hidden objects when the
viewer moves his or her head, resulting in an unnatural look to the 3D image (Hill and Jacobs, 2006;
Lizuka, 2008).
1.2. 3D Human Vision System
For 3D object perception, the perception of space in our daily life is through multifaceted depth
cues including monocular and binocular cues (Idesawa and Zhang, 1997; Braun et al., 2011).
The effectiveness of monocular cues is illustrated by allowing relative positions of objects in a 3D
scene to be judged when viewing a scene with one eye. These monocular cues include relative size
(retinal image size allows people to distinguish the distance based on the past and present experience
and familiarity with similar objects), interposition (one object partially covers another, and the
overlapped object is considered further away), linear perspective (parallel lines appear to converge
with one or more vanishing points), aerial perspective (objects further away look more washed out),
light and shade (highlights and shadows provide diferent objects’ dimensions and depth), and texture 
gradient (fine details on the near object can be seen clearly), and so on (Dodgson, 2005; Kooi and Toet,
2004).
Binocular cues provide depth information when viewing a scene with both eyes. Stereopsis is an
important binocular cue for depth perception, which refers to our ability to distinguish the perception
of depth that is constructed based on the difference between these two retinal images. It is due to a
lateral displacement of the eyes (approximately 6.5 cm); as a result, both eyes perceive two slightly

provide the connection between the real worlds with an historic event, meaning that historical event,
such as battle reenactments, can be augmented onto current landscapes.AR system in the touring
industry can connect different platforms to provide a richer experience to the final user of the system
(http://citizenmag.citizenm.com/issue-05/augmented-reality/).
The 3D display technologies have an expected market with a wide range. Besides the professional
fields, such as science, teaching, military, and so on, other fields, such as the display of the
merchandise, the exhibition, and the media, etc. provide a novel visual experience for the user.
1.4. The Ergonomics Issues of 3D Displays
Research on 3D displays has been widely published to understand their feasibility and limitations.
Many studies have indicated that viewers’3D visual experiences play a vital role in improving
displays. The current 3D technology for viewing autostereoscopic displays has several
problems—crosstalk, unnatural depth perception, eyestrain, discomfort, unusual stereopsis, and mental
loading—that urgently need to be addressed (Boydstun et al., 2009).
1.5. Research Purpose
The aim of this study was to search for the impactful factors that inducing the best image quality
and the least visual fatigue of the static picture and the dynamic film on stereoscopic displays. The
outcomes of this research could serve as a reference for the design of 3D displays. This two year
project carried out two human factors ergonomic experiments, including two parts, the static picture
and the dynamic film. The goal of each part was illustrated as follows.
The first year: the evaluation for the static picture on stereoscopic displays
1) To collect the references pertaining to the effect of image quality on 3D displays.
2) To set up an ergonomic experiment via design of experiment.
3) To find out the impactful factor of psychophysical visual fatigue and subjective comfort for the
content of the static picture.
4) Perceived depth was investigated in order to provide suggestions for the 3D content design.
The second year: evaluation for the dynamic films on stereoscopic displays
1) To gather the characteristic of the dynamic film in the previous studies.
61993; Seuntiëns et al., 2005). Wilcox and Stewart (2003) indicated that 75% of observers chose
crosstalk as the most important attribute in determining image quality.
Yeh and Silverstein (1990) indicated that crosstalk from 2% to 6% in stereoscopic color displays
significantly affected subjective ratings of image quality and visual comfort. Kooi and Toet (2004)
found that more than a half of viewers felt discomfort if crosstalk level was higher than 5% when
watching 3D displays. For two-view 3D displays, crosstalk level of the display influenced the viewer’s 
viewing experience. When the crosstalk level fell below 5.8%, the viewer could detect the crosstalk
but did not experience any disturbance. The viewer could be slightly affected when the crosstalk level
ranged from 5.8% to 10%, and the viewer could be disturbed when the crosstalk level ranged from
10% to 16%. Moreover, if the crosstalk level was higher than 16%, it could seriously interfere with the
3D image quality (Chen et al., 2005). The average crosstalk level was 7% in a multi-view
autostereoscopic display (Kaptein and Heynderickx, 2007). The previous studies implied that viewers
might have a greater tolerance degree of crosstalk in multi-view 3D displays than in two-view 3D
displays. When the viewing distance was 50 cm, the threshold of visual depth was 12 cm when
viewing 5% crosstalk level; the threshold of visual depth was 6.9 cm when viewing 20% crosstalk
level. The threshold of visual depth decreased with the increasing crosstalk level (Chiang et al., 2009).
2.1.2. Screen Luminance and Ambient Illumination
Several researchers have observed the effect of ambient illumination on the experience of
watching displays (Pölönen, 2011; Aarås et al., 2011; Lin and Huang, 2006; Chung and Lu, 2003;
Rempel, 2009; Kubo, 2000). Visual comfort on a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor was significantly
reduced by enhancing the surrounding illumination level from 300 Lux to more than 600 Lux (Aarås,
2001). The high room light of 50 Lux had a more drastic effect on image quality for a liquid crystal
display (LCD) screen when the surrounding monitor luminance ranged from 0% to 5% (Chakrabarti,
2003). Moreover, the higher level of ambient illumination caused the screen images to fade (Lin and
Huang, 2006; Chung and Lu, 2003). When subjects watched videos on a high dynamic range (HDR)
display under ambient lighting illumination of 0.75 Lux, 8.5 Lux, 28 Lux, and 74 Lux, the degree of
visual comfort was the same. The viewer did not get visual fatigue under these levels of environmental
illumination (Rempel, 2009). The contrast ratio decreases with increased ambient illumination with
making the screen brighter for the sake of surface reflection (Lin and Huang, 2006; Kubo et al., 2000).
As a result, screen brightness also plays an important role in the perception of visual imagery. As for
the small hand-held autostereoscopic display, the screen luminance level within the range from 9.73
8displays. The team finished 14 testing picture with Taiwanese characteristics, and they could be the
first standard image database for subjective evaluation and objective measurement in Taiwan (中華民
國科學技術年鑑, 2008).
Currently, there is no standard database of 3D. Most industries or schools used 2D pictures or the
image which were searched from the internet to create the 3D static picture and the 3D dynamic film
via 3D software. As a result, the representative pictures or films for the evaluation of image quality are
the major issue for the stereoscopic display.
2.3. Human Factors Evaluation
Visual fatigue and visual discomfort have been mentioned in the literature as the important health
issues in relation to stereoscopic and autostereoscopic displays (Kim et al., 2011; Tsirlin et al., 2009).
The all-inclusive diagnostic term for visual fatigue and visual discomfort is asthenopia, which literally
means “eyes without strength”(Mackenzie, 1843). Asthenopia occurs around the eyes, or may diffuse
as a general headache, or may result in a stiff neck and shoulders (Kim., 2011; Lambooij; 2009;
Suzumura, 1981). Lambooij et al. clearly defined that visual fatigue refers to a decrease in
performance of the human vision system, which can be objectively measured, whereas visual
discomfort is its subjective counterpart (Lambooij, 2009). Most ergonomic assessments on measuring
the degree of visual fatigue and visual discomfort have clustered into subjective and objective
indicators when viewing stereo images (Kim et al., 2011; Lambooij et al., 2009).
Subjective assessment methods are a means to perceptually evaluate stereoscopic content
according to individuals’ self-appraisal. They include psychophysical scaling and questionnaires.
Psychophysical scaling enables engineers to enhance and optimize their systems based on quantified
perceptual attributes. The critical fusion frequency (CFF) is the most used indicator in recent research
(Ho, 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012,
Yano et al., 2004). The CFF test is implemented in pre- and post- treatment (Lambooij, 2009; Yano et
al., 2004), and the difference value can be used an indicator for the sensitivity of the retina in terms of
visual fatigue (Iwasaki and Akiya, 1991). Questionnaires have been widely applied as a specific means
to assess the symptoms of visual discomfort (Lambooij et al., 2009). In most cases, the questionnaires
could incorporate a wide range of mental, social, and physiological aspects, and they are able to
evaluate the visual deficits in clinical research.

not a standard of the stereoscopic image. Hence, this study built up a standard of the static picture and
the dynamic film. The result could be authorized to the industry as a reference in the development of
the technology. In other words, based on the different design concept of each experimental image, it
could be the character of each display corporation.

experiment from the previous studies is shown in Figure 3.2 (IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, and J. Vliegen,

of the image quality of the current collected 15 papers indicated that at least four papers verified by the
experiment that display type and binocular disparity significantly affected subjective visual fatigue.
However, display type and moving velocity were as well as significant on subjective visual fatigue
(IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, and J. Vliegen, 2000; Mitsuhashi, 2004; Kooi and Toet, 2004; Yano, Emoto,
and Mitsuhashi, 2004; Speranza et al., 2006; Kenyon et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008; Kuze and Ukai, 2008;

14
Figure 3.3The effect of the dependent variables on (A) Spatial and time, (B) Content design, and (C)
display factor of the ergonomic experiment
There were five factors to be studied in a great amount of the previous studies. The results were
illustrated as follows.
1) Display type: the display type which did not affect the visual experience provided the more
comfort for the viewer. For example, the subject felt more comfortable when watching the
autostereoscopic display than when watching the stereoscopic display (Ntuen et al., 2009; Kenyon
et al., 2007; Kuze and Ukai, 2008).
2) Binocular disparity: the more difference of binocular disparity, the distance of the object and the
background could be judge easily. It also provided the better stereoscopic feeling. However, it
might cause the uncomfortable visual experience (Yano, Emoto, and Mitsuhashi, 2004; Speranza et
al., 2006; Li et al., 2008; Kuze and Ukai, 2008; Shibata et al., 2011).
3) Scene content: the better image quality may not provide the better visual experience. However, if
the image content near the real scene or provide the better depth cue, the subject felt comfortable
when watching the 3D images (Xinga et al., 2011; Kooi and Toet, 2004; Kenyon et al., 2007;
IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, and Vliegen, 2000).
4) Moving velocity: the higher speed of the moving velocity may induce the visual fatigue. Especially,
when the speed of the moving velocity exceeded 128 cm/sec. The previous indicated that the was a
interaction effect between the moving direction and the moving velocity (Lee et al., 2011; Shibata
et al., 2011).
5) Watching distance: the longer watching distance increased the visual fatigue when the visual cues
appeared conflict (Kenyon et al., 2007; Shibata et al., 2011; IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, and Vliegen,
2000).
From the above results, most of the evaluation method was subjective visual fatigue without the
objective visual fatigue, such as content of image and watching distance. The subjective questionnaire
is not representative, and it shows only part of the working loading. The subjective and objective
fatigue measurements need to be taken for the reference together to get a reliable outcome. On the
other hand, the testing image was the static picture in the most experiment. The dynamic film needed
to be added in the testing image. The difference between the real scene and the simulated image

camera to the target located in front of the TV screen, and consisted of 4 levels, 60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm,
and 120 cm. Concave distance was the image of the distance from the camera to the target located
behind the TV screen, and consisted of 4 levels, 240 cm, 260 cm, 280 cm, and 300 cm. The other
variable was two levels of ambient illumination, 0 and 300 Lux.
The dependent variables were perceived depth distance measurement, psychophysical visual
fatigue, and subjective visual comfort evaluation. A questionnaire evolved in visual comfort on a
five-score Likert’s scale. The questionnaire included six items, addressing dizziness, naturalness, depth, 
viewer crosstalk, slowed down focus change, and harmonization.
3.3.2. The 1st Stage Experiment: Apparatus and Experimental Environment
A 55-inch LED HDTV with 3D active shutter glasses was used in the experiment. Figure3.1
shows the experimental environment. The surrounding was a non-reflective wall. There was seven
yellowish bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and they can be adjusted the ambient illumination levels.
The viewing distance was around two meters. Figure3.2 illustrates the measurement of subjective
perceived depth distance. There were a long ruler between the subject and the 3DTV, a mirror in front
of the 3DTV, and an adjustable arrow on the top of the ruler. The device was used to find the proper
location of the target for the subjects. If the subject perceived the object as in front of the 3DTV (i.e.
concave distance), the subjects adjusted the head of the arrow to the exact location they saw. If the
subject perceived the object as behind of the 3DTV (i.e. concave distance), they had to adjust the
location of the arrow reflected in the mirror.

3.3.4. The 1st Stage Experiment: Subjects
There were total of 16 subjects, including four engineers who worked in the field of 3D displays
at the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan, and 12 graduate students from National
TsingHua University in Taiwan who have never experienced 3D displays. All the subjects were paid
for their participation.
3.3.5. The 1st Stage Experiment: Procedure
Only the subjects who were not color blind and possessed the correct or normal-to-correct visual
acuity (equal to or higher than 0.8) and stereo acuity could participate in the formal experiment. At
first, the subjects read the purpose and the procedure of the study, and signed the consent form. The
subjects were assigned to different combinations of 3D films to eliminate the potential order effect.
During one treatment, the subjects watched the four five-minute 3D films and measured the perceived
depth distance in each film. They orally answered the subjective visual comfort evaluation
questionnaire to the experimenter after 20 minutes when watching the films in one treatment. The
subjects had to finish two treatments and there was a 10-minute interval for the subjects to take a rest.
3.4. The Second Stage Experiment: Dynamic Films
3.4.1. The 2ndStage Experiment: Design of Experiment
The experiment was a mixed design, so-called split-plot design with velocity as a
between-participants factor, and disparity and brightness contrast ratio as within-subject variables.
Twenty-four subjects were assigned to experiment cells randomly.
The independent variables were as follows:
1) Disparity: -1.5o to -0.5o,- 0.5o to 0.5o, and 0.5o to1.5o, which means low, middle and high level of
disparity in the experiment. Most researches focused on the effect of magnitude of disparity not
crossed or uncrossed disparity, however, the latter might affect visual comfort a lot (Liu et al.,
2009; Shibata et al., 2011). Therefore, based on the general suggestion (1o ~ -1o), the wider range
of disparity from 1.5o to -1.5owas set in this study to examine the effect. Three levels were divided
into crossed disparity (-1.5o to -0.5o), one crossed zero plane (-0.5o to 0.5o), and uncrossed
disparity (0.5o to 1.5o).
2) Velocity: There were three levels of velocity, 50, 150, and 250 cm/s. Speranza et al. (2006)
investigated seven velocities: 32, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, and 512cm/s, and discovered that subjects
feel uncomfortable when the velocity exceeding 128cm/s. The effects of velocity at 130, 260, or
20

2) OPTECTM 2000 vision tester
3) Flicker Fusion System(TTK)

3.4.3. The 2ndStage Experiment: Stimuli
These dynamic images were created by 3Ds MAX. The software could control the locations,
movements, and brightness of objects. According to three independent variables, disparity (A),
velocity (B), and brightness contrast ratio (C), 18 experimental dynamic images were shown in Figure
3.7.

The relative disparity between foreground and background also caused visual discomfort (Li et al.,
2011), thus the sky was positioned behind the farthest one of 1o disparity in each image.
3.4.4. The 2ndStage Experiment: Subjects
There were twenty four subjects who were graduate students in National TsingHua University.
All subjects had 0.8 corrected visual acuity or better, normal color vision and normal stereo vision. All
subjects were randomly assigned to different experimental conditions.
3.4.5. The 2ndStage Experiment: Procedure
The process of the experiment is demonstrated in Figure 3.8.
1) Only the subjects who passed the test of basic visual acuity, stereoscopic ability, and color
blindness could participate in the experiment.
2) Subjects read the purpose of the experiment and filled out the consent.
3) Subjects were randomly divided into six different conditions of disparity and brightness contrast
ratio, and during the formal experiment, each participant watched three dynamic images with
different level of velocity.
4) Before and after watching the images, CFF and NPA value of the subjects were measured by the
experimenters, and the subjects answered the subjective comfort questionnaire orally to the
experimenters.

Furthermore, ambient illumination was a between-subjects factor, and convergence distance was
divided into convex and concave distance. The results showed significance on simple main effect of
convex distance (t(14) = -0.18, p<0.05), but no significant simple main effect on concave distance
(t(14) = 1.88, p>0.05).
4.1.2. The 1stStage Experiment: Subjective Visual Comfort Evaluation
The data of visual comfort evaluation questionnaire was on an ordinal scale. The nature of the
Likert’s scale suggests applying nonparametric statistics for data analysis (Duffy and Chan, 2002).
The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed that the main effect of convergence distance was not
significant on dizziness (Z = -0.083, p> 0.05), naturalness (Z = -0.171, p> 0.05), depth (Z = -0.021, p>
0.05), viewer crosstalk (Z = -0.502, p> 0.05), slowed down focus change (Z = -0.565, p> 0.05), and
harmonization (Z = -0.478, p> 0.05) of subjective visual comfort evaluation.
The Mann-Whitney U test revealed marginally significant effect of ambient illumination on
subjective visual comfort evaluation in terms of harmonization (Z = -1.890, p = 0.059 > 0.05), but not
significant on dizziness (Z = -0.145, p> 0.05), naturalness (Z = -0.535, p> 0.05), depth (Z = -1.740, p>
0.05), viewer crosstalk (Z = -0.963, p> 0.05), and slowed down focus change (Z = -1.022, p> 0.05).
The mean rank of harmonization in the high ambient illumination level, i.e. 300 Lux, was higher than
those in the low ambient illumination, i.e. 0 Lux (18.90 > 13.28). It implied that the viewer felt
visual comfort in the brighter environment.
4.1.3. The 1stStage Experiment: Subjective Perceived Depth Distance
The raw data was split into two groups, which were convex distance and concave distance, and
was analyzed by a repeated-measures ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for mixed design. The result
of convex distance group showed that the interaction effect between ambient illumination and
convergence distance was not significant on subjective perceived depth distance (F(3, 28) = 0.071, p>
0.05), neither was the main effect of ambient illumination (F(1, 28) = 1.029, p> 0.05). However, the
main effect of convergence distance attained statistical significance (F(3, 28) = 33.483, p< 0.001). The
result of concave distance group did not yield a statistically significant interaction effect between
ambient illumination and convergence distance (F(3, 28) = 1.085, p> 0.05). The main effect of ambient
illumination was marginally significant on perceived depth distance (F(1, 28) = 3.844, p= 0.06 > 0.05).
Nevertheless, a significant main effect of convergence distance was found (F(3, 28) = 12.025,
26
disparity (F (2, 24) = 0.942, p> 0.05) and brightness (F (1, 24) = 0.766, p> 0.05) was not significant,
either.
4.2.2. The 2ndStage Experiment: Objective Visual Fatigue—NP
The original NP value of the subject at the first of the experiment, i.e. before watching 3D videos,
acted as the baseline. The NP value was measured after the posttest, i.e. after watching 3D video. The
difference NP value between the baseline and posttest was an indicator of objective visual fatigue. A
greater positive difference in NP difference value means more visual fatigue for the subjects.
The result of the effect of within-subject variable, velocity, showed that there were not
statistically significant interaction effects of velocity and brightness contrast ratio (F (2, 48) = 0.824,
p> 0.05), and velocity, disparity, and brightness (F (4, 48) = 1.184, p> 0.05), neither was the main
effect of velocity, (F (2, 48) = 0.147, p> 0.05) by ANOVA test. However, the interaction effect of
velocity and disparity was significant on NP difference value, F (4, 48) = 3.121, p< 0.05)
Dynamic images with different levels of disparity demonstrate different tendencies on the mean
of NP difference value. Figure 4.1 shows the interaction effect between velocity and disparity. When
3D films were with the low level of disparity, NP value decreased with the increasing velocity.
However, when 3D films were with the middle level of disparity, NP value enhanced with the
increasing velocity. When images were at the high level of disparity, the lowest NP value appeared in
the middle level of velocity.

significant, (F (2, 24) = 0.692, p> 0.05). The ANOVA did not reveal the main effect of disparity (F (2,
24) = 0.148, p> 0.05) nor brightness (F (1, 24) = 0.213, p> 0.05), either.
2) General discomfort
The result of ANOVA showed that there were no interaction effects between velocity and
disparity (F (4, 48) = 0.878, p> 0.05), velocity and brightness (F (2, 48) = 1.649, p> 0.05), and velocity,
disparity, and brightness (F (4, 48) = 0.635, p> 0.05). The main effect of velocity was not significant
on general discomfort (F (2, 48) = 1.324, p> 0.05), either.
The analysis illustrated that the interaction effect between disparity and brightness (F (2, 24) =
1.066, p> 0.05). Neither was the main effect of disparity (F (2, 24) = 0.978, p> 0.05) nor brightness (F
(1, 24) = 0.234, p> 0.05) was not significant on general discomfort in terms of subjective comfort
evaluation.
3) Nausea
The significant interaction effects between velocity and disparity (F (4, 48) = 0.142, p> 0.05),
velocity and brightness (F (2, 48) = 0.142, p> 0.05), and velocity, disparity, and brightness (F (4, 48) =
0.684, p> 0.05) were not found on ANOVA test. The main effect of velocity did not significant on
nausea (F (2, 48) = 0.335, p> 0.05), either.
The interaction effect between disparity and brightness (F (2, 24) = 2.405, p> 0.05). Neither was
the main effect of disparity (F (2, 24) = 1.816, p> 0.05) nor brightness (F (1, 24) = 0.307, p> 0.05) was
not significant on nausea in terms of subjective comfort evaluation.
4) Focusing difficulty
The result of ANOVA showed that there were no interaction effects between velocity and disparity
(F (4, 48) = 0.847, p> 0.05), velocity and brightness (F (2, 48) = 0.042, p> 0.05), and velocity,
disparity, and brightness (F (4, 48) = 0.667, p> 0.05). However, the main effect of velocity attained
significance on focusing difficulty (F (2, 48) = 3.347, p< 0.05).
Table 4.2 demonstrates the Fisher’s LSD multiple comparison test of eye strain in terms of the 
subjective comfort evaluation. The results revealed there existed difference between two combinations

5) Headache
The result of ANOVA showed that there were no interaction effects between velocity and disparity
(F (4, 48) = 0.197, p> 0.05), velocity and brightness (F (2, 48) = 0.481, p> 0.05), and velocity,
disparity, and brightness (F (4, 48) = 1.176, p> 0.05). The main effect of velocity was not significant
on headache (F (2, 48) = 2.129, p> 0.05), either.
The interaction effect between disparity and brightness (F (2, 24) = 2.923, p> 0.05) was not found
on ANOVA test. However, neither was the main effect of disparity (F (2, 24) = 0.225, p> 0.05) nor
brightness (F (1, 24) = 0.047, p> 0.05) was not significant on headache in terms of subjective comfort
evaluation.

5.2.1. Interaction Effects of Independent Variables
The interaction effect between velocity and disparity was significant on objective visual fatigue
(NP).The result was similar to the previous findings (Yano et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2011; Nojiri et al.,
2003; Speranza et al., 2006) despite the level of variables in this study was different from the ones in
previous studies.
The interaction effect between disparity and brightness contrast ratio was significant on focusing
difficulty, which was not significant in Mai et al.'s (2011) study. The result might due to the difference
in the levels of disparity and in the definitions of brightness contrast ratio. In the present study,
stereoscopic images with three levels of disparity were conducted, but the levels of disparity were only
2D and 3D in Mai et al.’s research. Brightness distribution of integral images and 95% as high-key and
5% as low-key for brightness contrast ratio were set in this study. However, Mai et al. (2011)
calculated brightness contrast ratio by the brightness of foreground and background despite the area of
foreground and background might be unequal. It might be the reason why the interaction effect
between disparity and brightness was not found in the previous study.
5.2.2. Main Effects of Independent Variables
When viewing stereoscopic images with slow velocity, the value of eye strain and focusing
difficulty in terms of subjective comfort evaluation were the lowest, which was consistent with
34
they felt eye strain. And two combinations for the lowest focusing difficulty were 1) slow velocity,
middle disparity and low brightness contrast ratio and 2) slow velocity, low disparity and high
brightness contrast ratio. In summary, dynamic images with slow velocity were the best design for
causing the least objective fatigue and the most subjective comfort for 3D videos watching.
The result of NP and of the first combination of focusing difficulty showed that stereoscopic
objects with the middle level of disparity (-0.5o to 0.5o) and slow velocity (50cm/sec) would cause the
least objective fatigue and the most subjective comfort. The result also proposed in the previous
studies (Nojiri et al., 2004; 2006; Emoto et al., 2005; Lambooij et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011). However,
for the second combination of focusing difficulty, the outcome of disparity was different from the
Yano et al. (2002) and Ide et al.’s studies. In the present study, the high level of disparity was always
worse to low disparity, but Yano et al. (2002) and Ide et al. (2002) found that images with low level of
disparity caused the worst visual comfort for the viewers. It assumed brightness contrast ratio was not
considered in the previous studies. In addition, dynamic 3D films with the low level of disparity might
lead to the interest and concentration of the viewers based on the feedback of the subjects after the
experiment. It assumed that the subjects felt more comfortable because near fictitious images (with
low level of disparity) was more stereoscopic and active.
6. Conclusions
6.1. Summary
This research focused on the effect in viewing static and dynamic images. Based on which
dependent variable is in concern, the optimal combination of independent variables could be selected
as improvement. In conclusion, some of these findings were worth summarized:
1) In the static picture experiment, convergence distance was a critical factor which affected visual
fatigue and perceived depth. The increment of convergence distance leads to the increment of
perceived depth. Ambient luminance also played a role in visual comfort and visual fatigue. Under
convex image, dark ambient had more visual fatigue than bright ambient.
2) Convergence distance can be a predictor of perceived depth under those regressions for cubic fitted
line under convergence distance from 60cm to 120cm, quadratic fitted line under convergence
distance from 240cm to 300cm.
3) The main effects of ambient illumination on objective fatigue and subjective comfort were
contradictory. For the lowest objective fatigue, ambient illumination should be set at high (300lux);

1. Introduction
3D displays have moved to the mainstream due to the development of display technology in
recent years [1]. Three-dimensional television services have been introduced to the public along with a
variety of stereoscopic and autostereoscopic displays. Stereoscopic systems based on shutter glasses
are the most frequently used at home and have generated great focus in the display industry.
Inadequate display luminance and/or ambient illumination derive to the accommodation of the
brightness level to the pupil, thus inducing visual fatigue and decreasing the image quality. Several
researchers have studied the effect of the task in different ambient illumination environments in
watching displays [2-4].
Visual fatigue refers to a decrease in human vision system performance [5]. Usually, human
factors assessment of physiological evaluation is divided into subjective and objective measurements.
The subjective evaluation is easy to bring into practice and to identify observers that are particularly
sensitive to it. Several methods for subjective evaluation of visual fatigue have been tested.However,
the subjective degree of visual comfort by quantification is not representative of visual fatigue and
shows only part of mental loading. Most of the current studies on 3D displays were assessed by only
subjective fatigue measurement. Therefore, the objective and subjective indexes need to be combined
in order to determine the degree of visual fatigue and visual comfort in a sensitive, accurate, reliable,
and valid way.
One of the major risks in the wide acceptance of 3DTV is the potential to cause visual discomfort
and visual fatigue. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to find the impact of display luminance and
ambient illumination on the perception of the imagery displayed, and their appropriate combination
level need to further investigate.
2. Method
This research carried out an ergonomic experiment. The stimulus was the dynamic film and was
presented on a multi-view stereoscopic display.
2.1. Experimental stimuli
There were two types of dynamic films, the real scene and the animation, were used in the
experiment. The real scene included human movements, flowers and trees in the garden, vehicles on
the street, and so on. They were taken by a 3D video camera and the range of the shooting distance
46
If the data can be assumed to follow a normal distribution, a parametric statistical test is
appropriate to implement. As a result, objective visual fatigue and subjective fatigue measurement in
the experiment were analyzed by nonparametric methods.
3.1. Objective visual fatigue
The average CFF value of the subject before watching each level of display luminance of the
stereoscopic display acted as the baseline; the CFF value of the subject after watching the 3D films
was subtracted from this baseline to be a positive value. A greater difference in CFF represents much
tired for the viewer. The raw data were ranked on seven levels and then analyzed by a nonparametric
method.
A significant main effect of ambient illumination (Z = -6.552, p-value < 0.001) was found based
on the Wald-Wolfowitz Test. Furthermore, the effect of display luminance was also significant (χ2 (3)
= 16.037, p-value = 0.001) on the Friedman Test.
The CFF value of D55 (59.2 nits) was the highest in both light and dark ambience. This suggests that
the middle level of display luminance induces the most visual fatigue in viewing 3D dynamic films.
On the other hand, the CFF value of D35 (35.2 nits) at the high level of ambient illumination (A7, 300
lux) and D15 (16.7 nits) at the low level of ambient illumination (A0, 0 lux) were the lowest values.
Hence, it is reasonable that the viewer felt the most comfortable with the above level of display
luminance under different ambient illuminations.
3.2. Subjective visual measurement
There were significant differences of dizziness (Z = -7.056, p-value < 0.001), naturalness (Z =
-7.056, p-value < 0.001), depth (Z = -7.056, p-value < 0.001), viewer’s crosstalk (Z = -7.056, p-value <
0.001), slowness of focus change (Z = -7.056, p-value < 0.001), and harmonization (Z = -7.308,
p-value < 0.001) in the main effect of ambient illumination. In contrast, the above six indices of
subjective fatigue measurement were not statistically different with display luminance. It was assumed
that ambient illumination had a great impact on subjective fatigue measurement of viewing 3D films.
4. Discussion
4.1. The effect of display luminance and ambient illumination
The result showed that display luminance was statistically significant on objective visual fatigue
but not evidence for subjective fatigue measurement. Ambient illumination was significant on all

1 Introduction
1.1 Stereoscopic Vision
The diference of human eyes’ horizontal distance induces the tiny discrepancy of image for 
seeing the same object, and this is the reason of the depth perception writen in Euclid’s 
manuscript [1]. It is also caled “binocular disparity” in psychology. In 1838, Charles Wheatstone 
created the first stereo image via two separate mirrors with an angle. He found that disparity was
a sufficient and compelling stimulus for the perception of depth [2].From now on, 3D displays
have moved from a series of applications and become the mainstream as the development of the
display technology.
1.2 The Relation of Display Luminance and Ambient Illumination
The inadequate of the display luminance or the ambient illumination or both two derives to
the accommodation of the brightness level to the pupil and thus induce the visual fatigue and to
decrease the image quality.
Several researches have studied the effect of ambient illumination in watching displays [3], [4],
[5], [6]. Visual comfort on CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor was significantly decreased by
enhancing the level from 300 Lux to more than 600 Lux of the ambient illumination [3]. Besides,
the higher level of ambient illumination caused the display images to fade [4]. When subjects
watched videos on an HDR (HighDynamicRange) display under the ambient illumination of 0.75
Lux, 8.5 Lux, 28 Lux, and 74 Lux, the visual comfort degree was the same. The viewer did not
get visual fatigue under these four levels of environment illumination [5].
52
which was 0.38 nits, 6.73 nits, and 47.3 nits respectively.
(2) Ambient illumination: there were one yellow light bulb and seven yellow light bulbs, which
were 55 Lux and 300 Lux respectively.
There were five dependent variables.
(1) Objective visual fatigue index: CFF (Critical Fusion Frequency).
(2) Objective physiological fatigue index: HRV (Heart Rate Variability).
(3) Subjective comfort evaluation: Likert’s five scale on the degree of “eyestrain,” “seeing the 
object clearly,” “psychological fatigue,” and “physical fatigue.” 
(4) Visual discrimination performance: the total sum of the differences of 10 experimental
pictures in each treatment for subjects to find.

At first, the subjects read the purpose of the experiment and filled out the consent agreement
form. Their HRV were measured by ANS Watch as the baseline in the beginning of experiment.
There were three levels of display luminance. Each treatment took 20 minutes showing 10
experimental pictures with two minutes per experimental material on the stereoscopic display.
Before and after watching 3D pictures in the same level of display luminance, the subjects took
the objective visual fatigue by handy flicker. After each treatment, the HRV value was measured
and subjective comfort evaluation was assessed. The picture and the level of display luminance
and ambient illumination were randomly shown on the 3D display to eliminate any order effects.
The duration of the experiment for each subject was about two hours.

4 Discussion
4.1 The Effect of Display Luminance and Ambient Illumination
The two-way interaction was not statistically significant on objective physiological fatigue
(HRV) and visual discrimination performance. The effect of display luminance was significant on
subjective comfort evaluations, which were eyestrain, seeing the object clearly, and psychological
fatigue, and on visual discrimination performance. In addition, the effect of ambient illumination
affected objective visual fatigue (CFF) and subjective comfort evaluations, which were eyestrain,
seeing the object clearly, psychological fatigue, and physical fatigue.
4.2 The Best Combination Level of Display Luminance and Ambient Illumination
To consider the significant dependent variable of objective visual fatigue and subjective
comfort evaluation, the average value of these variables was ranked by the degree of comfort.
The highest sum number meant the best combination level of display luminance and ambient
illumination.
For watching 3D static pictures, viewers felt the most comfortable in the highest level of display
luminance (34.2 nits) and the highest level of ambient illumination (300 Lux). Moreover, the
combination level of the lowest display luminance (0.38 nits) and the lowest ambient illumination
(55 Lux) caused the most fatigue.
5 Conclusion
The result of this experiment did not show the significant physiological fatigue (HRV) in
watching 3D static pictures for 20 minutes, but indicated significant objective visual fatigue (CFF)
and subjective comfort evaluation. As a result, the duration of watching static pictures did not
induce the discomfort feeling.

displays. There have been only a few relevant studies on 3D displays.
The subjective measurement of depth perception distance was adopted in this study. This
research aimed at exploring the impact of ambient illumination and convergence distance on the
3D viewing experience by means of ergonomic assessment.
2 METHOD
2.1 Experimental Parameters
The experiment was a 2x2 mixed design with ambient illumination as a
between-participants factor and convergence distance as a within-participant factor. One half of
the subjects participated in low-level ambient illumination; the others participated in high-level
ambient illumination.
There were two independent variables. One variable was convergence distance which
consisted of two levels, concave and convex distances. Convex distance was the image of the
distance from the camera to the target located in front of the TV screen, and consisted of 4 levels,
60 cm, 80 cm, 100 cm, and 120 cm. Concave distance was the image of the distance from the
camera to the target located behind the TV screen, and consisted of 4 levels, 240 cm, 260 cm, 280
cm, and 300 cm. The other variable was two levels of ambient illumination, 0 and 300 Lux.
The dependent variables were perceived depth distance measurement and subjective
visual comfort evaluation. A questionnaire evolved in visual comfort on a five-score Likert’s 
scale. The questionnaire included six items, addressing dizziness, naturalness, depth, viewer
crosstalk, slowed down focus change, and harmonization.
2.2 Apparatus and Experimental Environment
A 55-inch LED HDTV with 3D active shutter glasses was used in the experiment. Figure
1 shows the experimental environment. The surrounding was a non-reflective wall. There was
seven yellowish bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and they can be adjusted the ambient
illumination levels. The viewing distance was around two meters. Figure 2 illustrates the
measurement of subjective perceived depth distance. There were a long ruler between the subject
and the 3DTV, a mirror in front of the 3DTV, and an adjustable arrow on the top of the ruler. The
device was used to find the proper location of the target for the subjects. If the subject perceived
the object as in front of the 3DTV (i.e. concave distance), the subjects adjusted the head of the
arrow to the exact location they saw. If the subject perceived the object as behind of the 3DTV
(i.e. concave distance), they had to adjust the location of the arrow reflected in the mirror.

experiment. At first, the subjects read the purpose and the procedure of the study, and signed the
consent form. The subjects were assigned to different combinations of 3D films to eliminate the
potential order effect. During one treatment, the subjects watched the four five-minute 3D films
and measured the perceived depth distance in each film. They orally answered the subjective
visual comfort evaluation questionnaire to the experimenter after 20 minutes when watching the
films in one treatment. The subjects had to finish two treatments and there was a 10-minute
interval for the subjects to take a rest.
3 RESULTS
3.1 Subjective Visual Comfort Evaluation
The data of visual comfort evaluation questionnaire was on an ordinal scale. The nature of
the Likert’s scale suggests applying nonparametric statistics for data analysis (Duffy and
Chan, 2002).
The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed that the main effect of convergence distance was
not significant on dizziness (Z = -0.083, p > 0.05), naturalness (Z = -0.171, p > 0.05), depth (Z =
-0.021, p > 0.05), viewer crosstalk (Z = -0.502, p > 0.05), slowed down focus change (Z = -0.565,
p > 0.05), and harmonization (Z = -0.478, p > 0.05) of subjective visual comfort evaluation.
The Mann-Whitney U test revealed marginally significant effect of ambient illumination
on subjective visual comfort evaluation in terms of harmonization (Z = -1.890, p = 0.059 > 0.05),
but not significant on dizziness (Z = -0.145, p > 0.05), naturalness (Z = -0.535, p > 0.05), depth (Z
= -1.740, p > 0.05), viewer crosstalk (Z = -0.963, p > 0.05), and slowed down focus change (Z =
-1.022, p > 0.05). The mean rank of harmonization in the high ambient illumination level, i.e. 300
Lux, was higher than those in the low ambient illumination, i.e. 0 Lux (18.90 > 13.28). It
implied that the viewer felt visual comfort in the brighter environment.
3.2 Subjective Perceived Depth Distance
The raw data was split into two groups, which were convex distance and concave distance,
and was analyzed by a repeated-measures ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for mixed design.
The result of convex distance group showed that the interaction effect between ambient
illumination and convergence distance was not significant on subjective perceived depth distance
(F (3, 28) = 0.071, p > 0.05), neither was the main effect of ambient illumination (F (1, 28) =
1.029, p > 0.05). However, the main effect of convergence distance attained statistical
significance (F (3, 28) = 33.483, p < 0.001). The result of concave distance group did not yield a
statistically significant interaction effect between ambient illumination and convergence distance
(F (3, 28) = 1.085, p > 0.05). The main effect of ambient illumination was marginally significant
on perceived depth distance (F (1, 28) = 3.844, p = 0.06 > 0.05). Nevertheless, a significant main
effect of convergence distance was found (F (3, 28) = 12.025, p < 0.001).
Furthermore, a significant correlation relationship between convergence distance and
62
Wang et al. (2012), who indicated that the viewer preferred the brighter ambient
illumination of 300 lux when watching 3D films.
Convergence distance was significant on subjective perceived depth distance. However,
the main effect of ambient illumination was slightly significant on perceived depth when
watching concave 3D films. Two regression models each provided a predictor for the
perceived depth distance when viewing the object with convex distance and concave
distance. The two dissimilar models revealed that there might have other binocular and
monocular cues that affect the perceived depth.

ABSTRACT
The purpose of this research is to solve the glare problems by changing lighting
environment configuration in nuclear power plant. Firstly, we interviewed the
operators in order to understand current screen reflection and glare impact on
operators. Then, we conducted an experiment and developed two strategies, 1)
attaching capacitive touch screen films to touch screen, and 2) the subjects wearing
polarized glasses in curent nuclear power plant’s lighting configuration environment. 
The dependent variables in this experiment included efficiency of operating, glare
degree, visual fatigue and subjective evaluation. Thirdly, we simulated light paths in
the current MCR and to find out the illumination level and the best lighting
configuration based on principles ofoptics (θi = θr), and then verified the efect by an 
experiment. Additionally, we run a field experiment in nuclear power plant to verify
the best improved design of the MCR.
