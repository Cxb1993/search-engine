as isolation, shallow junction, and latchup 
sensitivity. (4) Mixed Technologies. SOI 
devices have good immunity to substrate noise 
due to the isolation provided by the buried 
oxide layer and to the high-resistivity substrate, 
which also improves the performance of 
passive elements such as high-Q inductors and 
transmission lines commonly used in analog 
and RF circuits. It may also be useful to 
embedded DRAM because of good signal 
isolation from the logic circuit blocks. 
Therefore, besides the high performance 
microprocessor and low power logic, SOI 
offers advantages over the bulk silicon to 
realize an SOC by integrating high-
performance digital and analog/RF circuits. As 
a matter of fact, the SOI CMOS technology 
with fmax up to 100 GHz has penetrated into 
the RF SOC applications [2-3]. 
However, the main barrier to full 
exploitation of SOI CMOS performance is that 
the design of an SOI chip is a relatively risky 
process because a relative lacking of design 
experience makes it difficult to achieve fast 
turnaround and high probability of first-pass 
success. To surmount this barrier, a robust and 
physically accurate SPICE (compact) model is 
needed. SPICE modeling is the standard 
approach for precise design of standard cell 
libraries and critical-path sub-circuits in all 
large systems, as well as the basis for 
computing the look-up tables used in higher-
level timing simulators. IP blocks are in turn 
designed using the speedier simulations. The 
existing SOI SPICE models [4-6] are 
inadequate for GHz frequency operation since 
they were initially developed for low-
frequency applications and mainly focused on 
DC and transient behavior. The parasitic 
components ignored at low frequency become 
very important for predicting device 
performance at high frequency. 
Therefore, we propose to conduct 
research on RF/analog characterization and 
modeling for scaled SOI CMOS. In this 
project, state-of-the-art SOI MOSFETs will be 
characterized by DC, AC and S-parameter 
measurements. A new model which considers 
gate tunneling, gate input resistance, 
body/substrate resistance and floating body 
effects for scaled SOI CMOS operated at high 
frequency will be developed. Our investigation 
will further enhance the device design of 
digital SOI CMOS technology for RF/analog 
applications. The developed SPICE model will 
also facilitate RF/analog circuit 
simulation/design using advanced SOI CMOS.  
 
三、研究方法 
 
Since the device behavior is continuous 
as the frequency goes from low to high, a 
physically accurate SOI SPICE model at low 
frequency is crucial to compact RF SOI 
modeling. For sub-100-nm SOI CMOS [7], the 
modeling challenge at low frequency lies in 
the fact that an SOI model continuously 
spanning PD (Partial-Depletion) and FD (Full-
Depletion) is required due to the following 
considerations. (1) The need for multiple 
VT/TOX transistors for low active/standby 
power requirement in a single chip may result 
in the coexistence of both PD and FD devices 
in the same circuit by design. (2) The laterally 
non-uniform channel doping (halo/pocket 
implant) may lead to PD nominal devices and 
FD long-channel devices with continuous 
variations in between. (3) The influence of the 
gate field may encroach from the isolation 
edges and result in FD narrow-width devices. 
(4) The coexistence of PD and FD behaviors 
in a single device, depending on bias 
conditions. 
In our previous NSC project [8], we have 
used the concept of body-source built-in 
potential lowering (∆Vbi) [10] to solve the 
problem of the coexistence of PD/FD devices 
in a single chip as well as the coexistence of 
PD/FD behavior in a single device for scaled 
SOI CMOS [22-23]. In this project, we will 
use this unified model as our low frequency

四、結果與討論 
 
1. Modeling the Anomalous S-Parameter 
Characteristics in RF SOI MOSFETs 
 
The RF SOI MOSFETs used in this study 
were fabricated using state-of-the-art SOI 
technology. The thicknesses for gate oxide, 
SOI layer and buried oxide are 1.4nm, 40nm 
and 200nm, respectively. The presence of 
kinks in Fig. 1 shows that the devices under 
study are partially depleted (PD). 
On-wafer 2-port S parameters up to 6 GHz 
were measured, and then de-embedded with 
open dummy. Afterwards, the source/drain 
series resistances can be extracted using the 
method described in [29] and then be de-
embedded to get the intrinsic Y parameters of 
the device under test [28].  
Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional view of a 
PD SOI MOSFET. The corresponding 
intrinsic small signal equivalent circuit is 
depicted in Fig. 3(a), where the neutral-body 
parasitic is represented by a series 
combination of two junction capacitances, Cj,bs 
and Cj,bd, and a body resistance Rb along with 
the body trans-conductance gmb. In the 
conventional model (Fig. 3(b)) used for bulk 
MOSFETs, the body is usually out-connected 
to the signal ground, and hence the neutral-
body effect is eliminated. For PD SOI 
MOSFETs with floating body, however, these 
neutral-body related components have to be 
considered.  
Comparing Fig. 3(a) with Fig. 3(b), we can 
find that the major impact of the neutral-body 
effect is the output admittance Yds. The 
expressions of Re(Yds) and Im(Yds)/ω for these 
two models have been derived and shown in 
Eq. (2), (3), (6) and (7). It can be seen that Eq. 
(2) and (3) will be identical to Eq. (6) and (7), 
respectively, as Rb approaches infinity (i.e., 
full depletion). For PD SOI, however, Re(Yds)  
and Im(Yds)/ω  become frequency dependent 
due to the neutral-body effect. Table 1 lists 
their low and high frequency limits. One can 
find that if we neglect the significant low 
frequency dependence caused by the neutral-
body effect, the output conductance extracted 
from Re(Yds) at high frequency will no longer 
be 1/Rds. This also explains the abnormal 
phenomenon observed in [33].  
Figure 4 shows the expressions of the first 
derivative of Re(Yds) and Im(Yds)/ω  with 
respect to the angular frequency (Eq. (4) and 
(5)). They represent the slopes of the curves 
for Re(Yds) and Im(Yds)/ω versus frequency. 
Based on these expressions, we can find that 
the sign of these slopes is governed by the 
criteria summarized in Table 2. 
The modeling results of Re(Yds) and Im(Yds)/
ω for two different bias condition A (VDS = 
1.2V and VGS = 0.4V) and B (VDS = 1.2V and 
VGS = 1.2V) are shown in Fig. 5. The slopes of 
these curves in condition A and B meet the 
criterion I and II defined in Table 2, 
respectively, and both can be modeled by our 
derived Eq. (2) and (3). 
Figures 6 and 7 show the modeling results 
of S parameters with and without considering 
the neutral-body effect. Both S22 and S21 show 
abnormal low frequency behaviors and only 
the proposed model can capture these 
phenomena. It is worth noting that the 
criterion I and II can explain the abnormal 
inductance-like and kink behaviors in S22, 
respectively. 
The extracted body trans-conductance, 
junction capacitances and body resistance 
versus gate bias are shown in Fig. 8, 9 and 10, 
respectively. All these components show 
significant influence compared to the intrinsic 
ones and will play an important role in the 
characterization, analysis and modeling of RF 
SOI MOSFETs.

a leaky MOS capacitor, the total series

where Cm and Gm represent the measured 
capacitance and conductance, respectively, 
using the parallel circuit model of the LCR 
meter (Fig. 11(a)). 
Standard MOSFETs with doped poly-Si 
gate electrode were fabricated and tested in 
this study. The EOT is about 11 Å. The 
impedance analyzer HP4294A was used in the 
C-V measurement. The measurement 
frequency is 1 MHz. Fig. 17(a) and Fig. 17(b) 
show the measured inversion capacitance and 
our reconstructed C-V characteristics for 
NMOS and PMOS, respectively. The impact 
of Rii on the reconstructed results can be seen. 
Moreover, the correction for PMOS is larger 
because the lower PMOS channel mobility 
may result in a higher channel resistance and 
Rii. Besides, the reconstructed C-V 
characteristics show a slight decrease in the 
high VGS regime. This may be attributed to 
poly-depletion effects. Also shown in Fig. 17 
are the theoretical characteristics provided by 
the NCSU CVC (C-V analysis software 
developed by the North Carolina State 
University) [34-35]. Our reconstructed C-V 
curves agree with the NCSU-CVC simulation 
results. 
 
五、計畫成果自評 
 
In this project, we have investigated sub-
100-nm SOI CMOS with emphasis on 
RF/analog characteristics. Our investigation 
has included critical modeling issues regarding 
floating body effects [21], single-electron Gm 
oscillation in multiple-gate SOI [19,36], gate 
input capacitance extraction for ultra-thin 
oxide [20,37] and the body/substrate resistance 
effect for PD SOI MOSFETs operated at high 
frequency [29,38]. 
Our investigation will be instrumental in 
early anticipation of the potentials of digital 
SOI CMOS technology for RF/analog 
applications and enhancing the device design 
so as to effectively utilize the tremendous 
intrinsic speed resulting from further scaling 
of sub-100-nm SOI CMOS. The developed 
SPICE model and model parameter extraction 
procedure based on our investigation will 
enable early RF/analog circuit design and 
facilitate SOI CMOS for SOC applications.  
The results of the project have been 
disseminated through research reports in 
international journals [21,36,38] and 
conferences [19-20,29,37] as well as used in 
education of our graduate students to become 
leading researchers in the areas of compact 
modeling, device design and circuit simulation 
for SOI CMOS.
