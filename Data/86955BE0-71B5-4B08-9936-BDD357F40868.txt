2one-stage method of fundamental solutions, for solving steady and unsteady convection-diffusion
equations with variable coefficients. Although the one-stage method of fundamental solutions can solve
a wide range of partial differential equations, the matrix of coefficients system is highly ill-conditioned.
In addition, Chen et al. [15] found that the method of particular solutions can be considered as a sole
meshless method for solving Poisson, Helmholtz and biharmonic equations. They numerically proved
that the numerical solutions are very stable and accurate in comparing with the radial basis function
collocation method and the method of fundamental solutions. Besides, the conditioning number of the
coefficient system is not as high as other meshless methods. By inspiring by these two novel methods,
we expect to combine the key idea from both of them. Then the method of particular solutions will be
developed for more general partial differential equations.
In this project, we will develop a promising meshless method, which is the method of particular
solutions, to solve the steady and unsteady convection-diffusion equations. This newly-developed
meshless method is free from mesh generation and numerical quadrature. In addition, the conditioning
number of matrix system is better than other meshless methods. Therefore, it is worth to develop and
examine thoroughly this new meshless method. The possible factors will be investigated by numerical
experiments, such as the number of nodes, the type of radial basis functions, the time increment etc. The
governing equation and numerical method will be briefly introduced in the following sections.
2.2 Governing Equations
The two-dimensional governing equation for unsteady convection-diffusion of a scalar quantity
 ,T x t  can be expressed as:
             , , ,, , , ,T x t T x t T x tu x t v x t k T x t f x t xt x y

where  ,x x y  and t  are the spatial and time coordinates.  ,u x t  and  ,v x t  are the x-directional
and y-directional convection velocity, respectively.  ,T x t  is the scalar function, which may be the
pollutant concentration or temperature.   is the domain and k  is the diffusivity.  ,f x t  is the foring
term which is also known as the inhomogeneous term. The solutions of the above partial differential
equation can be obtained with some suitable initial and boundary conditions:

where B  is the boundary differential operator.
    Similar to the dual reciprocity method for boundary element method, the newly proposed method of
particular solutions re-arranges the above equation by moving all terms to the right-hand side except for
the Laplacian term.

6    From the brief introduction of the numerical scheme, it will be noticed that the proposed numerical
scheme is free from mesh generation and numerical quadrature. Therefore, we would like to develop the
promising meshless method for solving the steady and unsteady convection-diffusion equations. It would
be expected that the numerical results from this method will converge fast and are very accurate in
comparing with mesh-dependent methods.
2.4 Numerical Results
   In order to validate the proposed method of particular solutions, two numerical examples are provided.
The efficacy and stability of the proposed meshless scheme will be shown by a series of numerical
experiments. Besides, several factors that might influence on the performance of the numerical method
will be examined numerically. In order to check the accuracy of the numerical results, the
root-mean-squared error for every time step is used:

Fig 2 The computational domain and corresponding boundary for (a) example 1 and (b) example 2.
Example 1
   The computational domain is depicted in figure 2(a). From the figure, only two sets of nodes are
needed in the method of particular solutions. One is the boundary nodes and the other is the interior nodes.
The nodal connectivity and numerical integration are no more necessary since the proposed method is one
kind of the meshless methods. The initial and boundary conditions are derived from the analytical
solution which is shown as follows:
8Example 2
   In the second example, another irregular domain is used which is shown in figure 2(b). To solve the
time-dependent convection-diffusion equation in such an irregular domain is very time-consuming by
mesh-dependent methods. The initial and boundary conditions are obtained from the analytical solution
which is depicted as follows
        , , sin cos cosT x y t y x x y t    18
The following parameters are used: 0.5c  , 0.01t  , 50nb  , 319ni  . The evolutionary
processes by using different numbers of boundary nodes, different shape parameters and different time
increments are demonstrated in figure 5. The accuracy of the results is very stable with respect to number
of boundary nodes and the shape parameters of MQ RBF. Using smaller time increments can obtain better
results since the implicit Euler scheme is adopted for temporal discretization. From the results, the RMSE
will not accumulate with time which proves the numerical stability of the proposed scheme. Two more
RBFs are adopted except for MQ RBF. The evolutionary processes of Spline RBF and Conical RBF can
be found in figure 6. The accuracy is almost the same by using different orders of RBF. It is also
reasonable since the errors from temporal discretization will dominate the behavior of the errors in figure
5(c). From the results in the second example, the proposed scheme is very stable and extremely accurate.

2 計畫成果自評
The expected results of this project are totally achieved.
From the results of this project, the proposed method of particular solutions can efficiently and
accurately analyze the time-dependent convection-diffusion equations. The stability, consistency,
efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method are proven by a series of numerical experiments. Some
factors that might influence on the accuracy of the proposed scheme are examined in there numerical
examples. The codes are developed during the project. Besides, the numerical results of this project are
written as one paper for submitting to international journal after this project.
   Furthermore, two master students has good training on studying the meshless methods and developing
the computer codes. Both of advantages and disadvantages for the mesh-dependent and meshless methods
are well understood. Thus, the difference between the commercial software and the newly meshless
methods can be acquired.
   Based on the results of this project, it is believed that the method of particular solutions, one kind of
the promising meshless methods, can be extended for more complex engineering problems in the future.
