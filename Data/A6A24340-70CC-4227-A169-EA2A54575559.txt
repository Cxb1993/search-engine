the nonhomogeneous BHCP. For the 
two-dimensional (2-D) BHCP, Trong and 
Tuan [7] employed a truncated Fourier series 
method to solve the 2-D nonlinear BHCP, 
but this approach was complicated. After that, 
Tuan and Trong [8] adopted a new 
regularized method to deal with the 2-D 
nonhomogeneous BHCP. Of late, Li et al. [9] 
have proposed a meshless approach on the 
basis of radial basis functions method to 
solve multi-dimensional nonhomogeneous 
BHCPs, but their scheme was hard to 
implement. Later, Chang and Liu [10] 
extended the backward group preserving 
scheme to resolve these multi-dimensional 
homogeneous backward wave problems 
(BWPs) and obtained accurate results 
without utilizing a priori regularization. Then, 
Chang [11] have addressed a fictitious time 
integration method to tackle the 
homogeneous BWPs and obtained the 
accurate results. 
This paper is organized as follows. 
Section 3 demostrates the multi-dimensional 
nonlinear and nonhomogeneous BHCP and 
its final condition, boundary conditions and 
semi-discretization. We give a sketch of the 
GPS for ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs) and derive the BGPS [12-14] for the 
backward differential equations system in 
Section 4. In Section 5, we use the 
semi-discretization and a one-step BGPS to 
cope with some numerical examples. Finally, 
we draw some concluding remarks in Section 
6. 
  
3. Backward heat conduction problems

nonhomogeneous BHCP we ponder is 
respectively given by the following 
equations:

where u is a scalar temperature field of heat 
distribution, F(u) is a nonlinear function of u, 
and f is the heat source. We take a bounded 
domain D in ,jR  j = 1, 2, 3 and a spacetime 
domain ),0( TD×=Ω  in 1+jR  for a final 
time T > 0, and write two surfaces 
],0[B TD×∂=Γ  and }{F TD×∂=Γ  of the 
boundary .Ω∂ ∆  represents the 
j-dimensional Laplacian operator. While Eqs. 
(1)-(3) constitute a j-dimensional backward 
heat conduction problem for a given 
boundary data RBB  :Γu  and a final data

in Eq. (4) there are totally n coupled linear

4. Numerical methods 
 
4.1 Dynamics on a past cone 
For many systems in the engineering 
applications, the final value problems may 
occur because one wants to recover the past 
histories of state variables demonstrated in 
the physical models. These time backward 
problems of ordinary differential equations 
type can be described by

With a specified final value x(0) at t = 0, we 
intend to recover the past values of x in the 
past time of t < 0. 
We can embed Eq. (5) into the following

Fig. 1(a) indicates the errors of numerical 
solutions obtained from the BGPS for the 
case of T = 1 where the grid lengths 
295/π=∆=∆ yx  and the time stepsize 
1=∆t . At the point ,295/72π=x  the error 
is plotted with respect to y by a dashed line, 
and at the point ,295/97π=y  the error is 
plotted with respect to x by a solid line. The 
latter one is smaller than the former one 
because the point ,295/97π=y  is near the 
boundary. Furthermore, the errors are much 
smaller than that calculated by Trong and 
Tuan (2009b) as shown in Table therein. 
When applied the BGPS to this instance, 
we give a strict test of the BGPS, let T = 8.5, 
and the final data is large in the order of 
O(104
40/π=∆=∆ yx
). Nevertheless, we can use the BGPS 
to retrieve the desired initial data sinxsiny, 
which is in the order of O(1). The errors of 
numerical solutions calculated by the BGPS 
with  and one step in the 
calculation are shown in Fig. 1(b), in which 
at the point ,40/9π=x  the error is plotted 
with respect to y by a dashed line, and at the 
point ,40/12π=y  the error is plotted with 
respect to x by a solid line. For this very 
difficult problem, the BGPS proposed here is 
also good with a maximum error .107 3−×  
   In Fig. 2, we compare the numerical 
errors with T = 0.25 for two cases: one 
without the random noise and the other with 
the relative random noise in the level of sr
 
 = 
0.02%. The exact solutions and numerical 
solutions are plotted in Figs. 3(a)-(c) 
sequentially. Even under the noise, the 
numerical solution displayed in Fig. 3(c) is a 
good approximation to the exact initial data 
as presented in Fig. 3(a).

errors with T = 1.5, where the grid lengths

numerical solution displayed in Fig. 5(c) is a

as displayed in Fig. 5(a). 
,20/1ΔΔΔ === zyx  the 
time stepsize is taken to be 5.1Δ =t . At the 
point x = 0.1 the error is plotted with respect 
to y and z by a dashed line, at the point y = 
0.3 the error is plotted with respect to x and z 
by a solid line, and at the point z = 0.8 the 
error is plotted with respect to x and y by a 
dotted line. The latter one is smaller than the 
former two because the point z = 0.8 is near 
the boundary. This instance is a hard BHCP 
to examine the numerical performance of 
novel numerical approaches. Nevertheless, to 
the authors’ best knowledge, there has been 
no report that numerical approaches can 
calculate this ill-posed multi-dimensional 
nonhomogeneous BHCP very well as our 
method. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The multi-dimensional nonlinear and 
nonhomogeneous BHCPs have been 
calculated by the formulation with a 
semi-discretization of the spatial coordinate 
of backward heat conduction equations in 
conjunction with the backward group 
preserving numerical integration scheme. In 
this report, we are interested in this numerical 
integration problem, where the pivotal point 
is the construction of a past cone and a BGPS. 
In addition, we can erect a past cone, Lie 
algebra and Lie group delineation of the 
backward problems governed by differential

Abstract:  In this study, we propose a new numerical approach for solving the nonhomogeneous 
backward heat conduction problems (BHCPs). A fictitious time τ is used to transform the 
dependent variable u(x, t) into a new one by (1+τ)u(x, t)=: v(x, t, τ), such that the original 
nonhomogeneous heat conduction equation is written as a new parabolic type partial differential 
equation in the space of (x, t, τ). Besides, a fictitious viscous damping coefficient can be employed 
to strengthen the stability of numerical integration of the discretized equations by utilizing a group 
preserving scheme. Several numerical instances illustrate that the present algorism can be used to 
retrieve the initial data very well. Even under the large noisy final data, the fictitious time 
integration method is also robust against noise.
