本研究利用化學氣相沈積法在(100)鋁酸鋰基板上成長 (0001)方位的氧化鋅磊晶薄膜。研究
的重點是澄清成長溫度和反應壓力對氧化鋅磊晶成長行為的影響。結果顯示成長溫度為 450
oC～575oC 之間時，(1010)方位和(0001)方位的氧化鋅可以同時在 LAO 基板成核，但是後
者的成長速率遠高於前者，因此最後會得到(0001)方位的氧化鋅。但是(0001)方位的氧化鋅
在上述兩個溫度下的成長模式並不相同，在較低溫時，(0001)氧化鋅是沿[0001]方向成長成
柱狀，而在較高的溫度下，(0001)氧化鋅不但可以沿[0001]方向，也可以在垂直[0001]方向
側向成長而成倒金字塔形。在較高的成長壓力（2.7x104 Pa）下，上述之倒金字塔形結晶較
易互相合併成較平坦的磊晶薄膜。因此本研究進一步利用兩階段成長的方式，在高溫下先
在基板上成長成長(1010)方位氧化鋅，在氧化鋅尚未完全覆蓋基板之前，降低成長溫度至
470～575oC 之間進行第二階段成長，利用(1010)方位氧化鋅作為遮罩，降低(0001)方位的
氧化鋅的成核密度，以進一步降低磊晶薄膜的低角度晶界。結果顯示以此方法可以在低溫
下得到結晶性良好的奈米柱結構，在較高溫下則可以得到較平坦的磊晶薄膜，且其 UV 發
光峰半高寬較一階段成長的磊晶薄膜窄，黃綠光發光峰強度也較低。換言之，利用自遮罩
法成長(0001)方位的氧化鋅磊晶或奈米結構確實可以進一步改善其發光特性。

1. INTRODUCTION
-LiAlO2 (100) substrate is an attractive alternative to replace sapphire due to its low
lattice mismatch to ZnO. -LiAlO2 (LAO) was originally proposed for growing GaN in its
nonpolar  0110 directions [1, 2]. However, (0001) oriented GaN and ZnO have also been
reported to grow on the LAO (100) substrates [3-8]. This phenomenon may be attributed to the
fact that not only does a tetragonal symmetry of the (100)LAO surface lead to a good match with
the (1010) of ZnO and GaN, but also a quasi-hexagonal symmetry of the anions and cations can
be allocated [6]. The ball-and-stick model of LAO in [100] projection and the tetragonal as well
as the quasi-hexagonal lattices are illustrated in Fig. 1. The mismatch between the LAO
tetragonal lattice and the {1010}ZnO lattice is 0.7% in [010]LAO∥[0001]ZnO direction, and is 3.6%
in [001]LAO∥[1 2 10]ZnO direction. On the other hand, the bond lengths of cations in the
quasi-hexagonal lattice are in a range of 0.305 nm to 0.315 nm, resulting in mismatches of
-3.0~-6.0% with the neighboring Zn ions in the (0001)ZnO. The mismatches for the anions in the
quasi-hexagonal lattice and the (0001)ZnO are in a range of -11.7% to 5.7%. Consequently, both
the (1010) and (0001) oriented ZnO are possible to grow on the LAO (100) substrates. The
growth temperatures, in fact, play a key role for the orientation competition. At high growth
temperatures of 650 oC or above, only (1010) oriented ZnO were obtained, whereas a (1010) and
(0001) mixture was obtained at low growth temperatures [7, 8].
In order to clarify the growth mechanism of the (0001) oriented ZnO on LAO (100)
substrate, high resolution scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to
monitor the evolution of the morphology and crystal orientation of the films with respect to the
deposition time. Detailed microstructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.
Photoluminescence results were also reported.
Fig. 1 Ball-and-stick model of LAO in [100] projection with the tetragonal lattice (light gray), the
quasi-hexagonal anion lattice (black) and the quasi-hexagonal cation lattice (dark gray) indicated.
time to 3000 s, Fig. 4b shows that the crystals grow to an average size of ~100 nm and some of
them have started to coalesce with each other. Fig. 4c shows that the substrate is all covered by
well aligned hexagons of about 800 nm in size for sample deposited for 7200 s. EBSD pattern
indicated that the hexagons are perpendicular to [0001] direction with their edges parallel to the
<1120> directions. In addition, deep trenches can still be observed between some hexagons
and result in a relatively rough surface. Fig. 4d is the SEM micrograph of the film deposited for
10800 s showing that the hexagons coalesce further to form a continuous film and the surface
roughness of the film therefore decreases dramatically.

Fig. 5 X-ray diffraction pattern for LiAlO2 substrate and ZnO films deposited at 575 oC for 1000
s , 3000 s and 10800 s.
Fig. 6a shows a cross section TEM bright field (BF) image of the film deposited at 575 oC
for 7200 s. Two kinds of crystals are observed: dome-shaped crystals of about 300 nm in height
and trapezoid-shaped ones of about 600 nm in height. The TEM selected area diffraction
patterns of LAO and these two types of crystals are shown in Fig. 4b-d, respectively. The
electron beam is parallel to the [021]LAO direction. Both the ]3121[ zone axis of the
trapezoid-shaped ZnO and the ]0112[ zone axis of the dome-shaped ZnO are deviated within
one degree from the [021]LAO. The dome-shaped crystals have their [1010] direction parallel to
the growth direction and are labeled M. The crystals of the trapezoid shape have a (0001)
azimuthal orientation and are labeled C accordingly. The (1010) and (0001) oriented crystals
possess orientation relationships with the LAO substrate which coincide well with those predicted
in Fig. 1 and were reported previously [8]. Fig. 4a also shows that both types of crystals were
nucleated directly on the LAO substrate. The (0001) oriented crystals not only did possess a
high growth rate in [100]LAO direction but also grew laterally over the neighbored (1010) oriented
ones. The growth of the (1010) oriented crystals were therefore gradually prohibited by the
lateral overgrown (0001) crystals. The shape of the (0001) oriented crystals is actually an
up-side-down, hexagonal pyramid with a top (0001) surface, which results in a trapezoid-shaped
cross section. The angle between the pyramid capping surfaces and the top surface is in a range
of 47 o~60 o so that the capping surfaces correspond to {101 1} or {20 2 3} surfaces.

deposited at (a) 470 oC (P=2.7x104 Pa), (b) 575 oC (P=7x103 Pa), (c) 575 oC (P=1.3x104 Pa) and
(d) 575 oC (P=2.7x104 Pa),.
Fig. 8a and 8b are the cross-section TEM bright field images for films deposited at 470 oC
(P=1.3x104 Pa) and 575 oC (P=2.7x104 Pa). Fig. 8a shows that the height of the nanorods is
~1000 nm in average. In addition, small crystals, 100~200 nm in height, located between the
rods can also be observed. Electron diffraction verified that the small crystals have two kinds of
orientations. The smaller crystals usually have their [01 1 0] direction parallel to the [100]LAO
direction. The bigger ones have, on the other hand, a (0001) azimuthal orientation. The
former were mainly formed at the first stage of growth at 650 oC as a mask. At the second stage,
the growth of the (01 1 0) oriented crystals were slow and the (0001) oriented crystals could
nucleate in the interstices of the (01 1 0) oriented crystals and grew fast. The density of the rods
therefore partly relied on the nucleation density of the (011 0) oriented crystals. Moreover, the
competence among the rods also reduced the density of the rods. As a consequence,
well-oriented ZnO nanorods can be grown on the LAO (100) substrate with their density
controlled by the density of the (01 1 0) oriented crystals deposited at a high temperature of 650
oC as a mask. Fig. 8b shows that dense nanorods are formed at 575 oC with a growth pressure of
1.3x104 Pa. The rods then grow laterally at the late stage of growth to form hexagonal pyramids.
This result give an evidence that the (0001) oriented crystals could grow laterally at a medium
temperature of 570 oC. In addition, no threading dislocations are observed in the rods indicating
3.26eV(575 oC) and 3.29eV (450 oC), respectively, associated with strong green/yellow emission.
The sample grown at 450 oC possesses a stronger UV emission peak with a lower FWHM value
of ~150 meV, as compared to the 200 meV for the sample grown at 575 oC. The result can be
explained by the morphology of the film. For the sample deposited at 5750 oC, the ZnO crystals
coalescence to each other which forms high density of low angle boundaries. It is known that the
