micrometer-size powders [1,2]. Solid 
oxide fuel cells are attracting widespread 
attention due to their high energy 
conversion efficiency and low pollution. 
High-oxide ionic conducting solid 
electrolytes based on zirconia have been 
intensively investigated [3,4]. In order to 
reduce the operation temperature from 
1000 to 800oC or even lower, doped 
ceria has been considered as the solid 
electrolyte for moderate temperature 
solid oxide fuel cells [5].   
In current research, we have 
attempted a new method, 
microwave-induced combustion 
synthesis, to produce Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2x 
nanopowder.  Microwave processing of 
materials is fundamentally different 
from conventional processing due to its 
heating mechanism. In a microwave 
oven, heat is generated within the 
sample itself by the interaction of 
microwaves with the material. In 
conventional heating, the heat is 
generated by heating elements, which is 
then transferred to the sample surfaces 
[6].  
The microwave-induced 
combustion synthesis process involves 
the dissolution of cerium nitrate 
(Ce(NO3)3‧6H2O), lanthanum nitrate 
(La(NO3)3‧6H2O), and urea (CO(NH2)2) 
in water, and then heating of the solution 
in a microwave oven. The urea and 
metal nitrate decompose and give 
flammable gases. After the solution 
reaches the point of spontaneous 
combustion, it begins burning and 
becomes a solid, which burns at high 
temperature. Combustion is not 
complete until all the flammable 
substances are consumed, and the 
resulting material is a loose, highly 
friable substance exhibiting voids and 
pores formed by the escaping gases 
during the combustion reaction [7]. The 
whole process takes only a few minutes 
to yield Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2x nanopowders. 
 
2.1. Sample synthesis 
   The synthesis process involved 
the combustion of redox mixtures, in 
which metal nitrate acted as an oxidizing 
reactant and urea as a reducing one. The 
initial composition of the solution 
containing cerium nitrate, lanthanum 
nitrate, and urea was based on the total 
oxidizing and reducing valences of the 
oxidizer and the fuel using the concepts 
of the propellant chemistry [8-10].       
Stoichiometric amounts of cerium 
nitrate (Ce(NO3)3‧6H2O), lanthanum 
nitrate (La(NO3)3 ‧ 6H2O), and urea 
(CO(NH2)2) dissolved in a minimum 
quantity of water, were placed in a 
crucible. The crucible containing the 
solution was introduced into a 
microwave oven. The powder samples 
prepared by microwave-induced 
combustion process were palletized and 
sintered at 1450oC for 3 h. The sintered 
samples were over 94 % of the 
theoretical density in all specimens. 
2.2. Characterization measurements

diffraction peaks to shift to new 2θ 
position. As the La-doped amount 
increase, the lattice constant increases 
linearly as a (x) = 5.39424 + 0.3555x for 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2ceramics (x = 0.00 ~ 0.20). 
   The electrical conductivity of 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics as a function of 
temperature are plotted in Fig. 4. and Fig. 
5. This indicates that the maximum 
electrical conductivity of the sintered 
specimens was 0.047 S/cm at 850oC for 
Ce0.84La0.16O1.92 specimen. With 
increasing temperature, the oxide ion 
mobility increasing, and the 
conductivities increase at high 
temperature. Activation energy for 
conduction is obtained by plotting the 
ionic conductivity data in Arrhenius 
relation for thermally activated 
conduction. Figure 6 displays the 
variation of the activation energy, Ea as 
a function of La-doped amount in 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics in the 
temperature range of 500-850oC. The 
activation energy decreases gradually 
with increasing lanthanum substitution 
and reaches a minimum, Ea = 0.759 eV 
for Ce0.84La0.16O1.92 specimen. Further 
increasing the lanthanum amount for x 
＞  0.16 leads to a rise in activation 
energy. It is due to the formation of 
defect associations [12,13]. A summary 
of relativity density, electrical 
conductivity, and activation energy of 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics sintered at 
1450oC for 3 h is listed in Table Ⅰ. It 
depicts that sintered Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 
samples were over 94% of the 
theoretical density in all specimens. The 
thermal expansion depend on the 
electrostatic attraction forces within the 
lattice, which are a function of 
concentration of positive and negative 
charges and their distances within the 
lattice. The thermal expansion increases 
if the attraction forces decrease. The 
thermal expansion coefficient of 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics is depicted in 
Fig. 7. It reveals that the thermal 
expansion coefficient of Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 
ceramics initially increases with 
increasing La-doped amount in range of 
x = 0.04 - 0.08. Further increasing the 
lanthanum amount leads to a drop in 
thermal expansion coefficient and 
reaches a minimum thermal expansion 
coefficient of 18.677 ppm/oC for 
Ce0.84La0.16O1.92 specimen. This 
phenomenon is in correspondence with 
the result of ionic conductivity for 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics. It indicates that 
La-doped CeO2 ceramics with higher 
conductivity but possessed lower 
thermal expansion coefficient. Ionic 
conductivity gives a correlation to 
thermal expansion, indicating the 
dominating role of the oxygen vacancy 
concentration for Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 
ceramics. The decrease in the thermal 
expansion is associated with oxygen 
losses in course of doping La. The 
Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2 ceramics have a minimum 
thermal expansion coefficient at x = 0.16, 
indicating Ce0.84La0.16O1.92 with 
maximum oxygen vacancy 
concentration in Ce1-xLaxO2-1/2ceramics.
