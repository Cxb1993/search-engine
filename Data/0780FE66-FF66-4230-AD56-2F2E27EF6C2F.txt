GHz-grade SAW devices [4]. A variety of
deposition methods have been used to
prepare AlN films, including metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) [5],
physical vapor deposition (PVD) [6].
Deposition methods using an ion beam
source, such as ion beam sputtering
deposition [7] and ion beam assisted
deposition (IBAD) [8,9].
However, The AlN film with fast
acoustic velocity at (002) orientation only.
Recently, a new material, LiAlO2, with high
speed of transfer (about 8000m/sec) was
measured [10]. Although the LiAlO2 with
three structure – tetragonal [11,12],
hexagonal [13,14] and orthorhombic[15,16],
nevertheless the structure of LiAlO2, with
high speed of transfer, is tetragonal phase.
At the same time, the character of LiAlO2,
with high speed of transfer, is not limited
the crystalline orientation. On other hands,
among (001), (010) and (100) have same
characterization.
The ion beam sputtering system is a
relatively new method of preparing thin
films, such as ion beam assisted deposition
(IBAD) [17] and ion beam sputtering
deposition (IBSD) [18]. With the low
processing temperature and the lower
sputtering pressure, the mean free path
of atoms is larger than the substrate/ target
distance, which resulted in increased energy
transfers to the sputtered particles, the
smoother surface and the easier control of
the composition of the film.
The LiAlO2 film film needs to deposit
in electrode for SAW device. Therefore, the
LiAlO2 film deposited in different
electrodes are studied as a function of the
deposition parameters of dual ion beam
sputtering deposition (DIBS). The LiAlO2
film with different structures and orientation
were also investigated.
Experimental
The LiAlO2 with different bottom
electrodes were prepared by the
radio frequency DIBS system and various
parameter such as varying temperatures of
deposition, oxygen gas flow (0–20 sccm),
ion beam energy and substrate
temperature. The targets of 99.99% LiAlO2
are used and the n-type Si (100) wafer was
used as substrate.
Before the LiAlO2 films were deposited,
the Si substrates were cleaned ultrasonic
with acetone, alcohol and de-ionized water.
During deposition, the target was
pre-sputtered for at least 30 minutes
to remove any surface contaminants.
Then the shutter was opened to
deposit an bottom electrode layer
about 30 nm thick on the Si substrate
under various beam voltage for each
electrode bottom. The oxygen gas flow was
introduced to format LiAlO2 film and the
growth time was 180 minutes.
The crystallinity and the structure of
the LiAlO2 films were examined by X-Ray
diffraction (XRD). The microstructures were
studied by scanning electron microscope
(SEM) and transmission electron microscope
(TEM).
Results and Discussions
The X-ray diffraction results of LiAlO2
dark field image (DFI) is shown in Fig. 6(c)
and (e). The microstructure reveals nanometer
grain about 20 nm in average. At the same
time, the twin grain boundary exhibition in
nanometer grain to format the grain growth.
Conclusions
LiAlO2 nanometer crystals were
deposited on Si (100) substrates using the
dual ion beam sputtering deposition (DIBSD)
system with different bottom electrodes at
variable beam energy, oxygen gas flow and
temperature. The highly textured of LiAlO2
films can be synthesized at 700 eV energy
flux, 300oC and 15 to 20 sccm oxygen gas
flow.
Based on this study, it was observed that
(1) the LiAlO2 films deposited with a
bottom Ag electrode is better than with a
bottom Ti/Mo/Ni/Al electrode at 300oC; (2)
for substrate heated at 300O C, the LiAlO2
films deposited with a bottom Ti electrode is
better than other temperature at 700eV, 60mA
and oxygen 20 sccm. ; (3) Regardless the
bottom electrode, the oxygen gas flow is
between 15 and 20 sccm is better to deposited
LiAlO2 films in condition of 700eV, 60mA
and 300oC.
