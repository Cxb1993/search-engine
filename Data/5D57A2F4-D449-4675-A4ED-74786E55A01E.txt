Abstract 
Nonpolar a-plane ZnO thin films were deposited on the single-crystal perovskite SrTiO3 (100) 
substrates at 750℃by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The effects of ultrathin 30 nm-thick ZnO buffer 
layer grown at 300-600℃ on the physical properties of ZnO/SrTiO3(STO) thin films are investigated. A high 
growth temperature of ZnO buffer layer enhances not only the (110)-texture of ZnO/STO thin films but also 
the crystalline quality of the film. However, the ZnO/STO thin film without a ZnO buffer layer has a poor 
crystalline quality comparing to those with the ZnO buffer layer. Atomic force microscopy morphology 
studies reveal that the ZnO buffer layer largely decreases the surface roughness of the ZnO/STO thin films. 
This may be because of the thin ZnO buffer layer effectively decreases the stress between the ZnO and STO. 
The results of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence 
spectra show that a high-quality epitaxial ZnO(110)/STO(100) thin film that emits UV light at room 
temperature can be formed with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown at 600℃. The subsequently deposited 
Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) thin films on the ZnO layers show the perovskite-structured phase. The secondary ion 
mass spectrometer depth profiles reveal that an atomic interdiffusion between the constituent layers occurs at 
the BST/ZnO interface at a high growth temperature. The dielectric constant of the BST film increases with 
increasing the deposition temperature, owing to the higher grain size. However, a higher deposition 
temperature of BST results in an increase of leakage current density.

microscope (HRTEM) were prepared with a dual-beam focused-ion-beam instrument.  The areas selected for 
cutting with an ion beam were protected with an amorphous carbon overlayer. The room temperature 
dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra are obtained using the 325 nm line of a He-Cd laser. To measure 
electrical properties, we sputtered Pt top electrodes onto the surface of superlattice films at room temperature. 
The dielectric properties of the films were measured using HP 4192ALF impendence analyzer at room 
temperature. The leakage current density was measured using an HP4140B pA meter/dc voltage source at 
room temperature. 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1(a) exhibits the XRD patterns of the 400 nm-thick ZnO/STO thin films without and with a thin 
ZnO buffer layer grown at various temperatures.  The XRD patterns reveal a single wurtzite structure of ZnO 
and include well-defined (110) Bragg peaks from the ZnO thin films. The intensity of the (110) Bragg peak of 
ZnO thin films increases with growth temperature of the thin ZnO buffer layer. However, the (110) Bragg 
peak of the ZnO/STO thin film without a buffer layer has a relatively low intensity in comparison with that of 
ZnO/STO thin film having a ZnO buffer layer. A tiny (002) Bragg peak of ZnO was observed for the 
ZnO/STO films with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown below 600oC, revealing these ZnO/STO thin films have 
mixed crystallographic characteristics. The content of (110)-oriented grains in the film can be roughly 
determined from the intensity ratio I(110)/[I(002)+I(110)] of ZnO Bragg reflections. The background intensity 
was deducted from each Bragg reflection. The ZnO/STO thin films without and with a ZnO buffer layer that 
was grown at 600oC exhibit pure (110) Bragg reflections. These ZnO/STO films have a pure (110)-oriented 
crystallographic feature. Moreover, the ZnO/STO thin films with a ZnO buffer layer grown at 300 and 450oC 
have intensity ratios I(110)/[I(002)+I(110)] of 96.2 and 98.1%, respectively, revealing a very small portion of 
(002)-oriented grains in the ZnO/STO thin films. A relatively low surface mobility of the atomic species 
during thin ZnO buffer layer deposition at a low temperature might result in the formation of grains with 
mixed crystallographic features. This might account for the non-perfect (110)-oriented ZnO/STO thin films 
were formed with a ZnO buffer layer grown below 600oC. The bulk ZnO has a hexagonal structure with 
lattice parameters a=0.3249 nm and c=0.5206 nm. The STO substrate is cubic with a=0.3905 nm [6]. In ZnO 
(110)/STO (100) system, Karger et al. proposed that the lattice misfit in the ZnO film plane along the [-110] 
direction is ~1.9% [12]. The lattice spacing of (110) Bragg reflection of the ZnO/STO thin films can be 
derived from Fig. 1(a). The lattice spacing of ZnO (110) plane for the ZnO/STO thin films with a ZnO buffer 
layer grown at various temperatures are the same (0.1641 nm). However, that of the ZnO/STO thin film 
without a ZnO buffer layer has a relatively small value of 0.1634 nm. The misfit between the ZnO and STO 
might cause a compressive strain in the ZnO film. The relatively small lattice spacing of (110) for the 
ZnO/STO thin film without a ZnO buffer layer might indicate that the ZnO buffer layer helps to release the 
lattice strain of thick ZnO film on the STO substrate. The use of buffer layer to reduce lattice misfit strain has 
been reported in ZnO thin films grown on sapphire or other single-crystalline substrates [9,13]. Figure 1(c) 
plots the full widths at half maxima (FWHM) of (110) Bragg reflections from ZnO thin films. The FWHM 
value of ZnO (110) clearly decreases from 0.98 to 0.41o for the ZnO/STO thin films with the growth 
temperature of ZnO buffer layer increases from 300 to 600oC. A ZnO buffer layer that was grown at a high 
growth temperature has a large grain size. This might decrease the density of nucleation sites and lowering the 
dislocation density for the subsequent deposition of ZnO thin film [14]. Moreover, a high temperature 
deposited ZnO buffer layer has a high degree of (110)-oriented grains in the film further enhancing not only 
 6
during the growth of ZnO (110) in comparison with that of ZnO (002) [22]. From Fig. 5, the relative PL 
intensity ratio of the dominant peak at ~3.26 eV increased with the growth temperature of ZnO buffer layer 
because a highly crystalline ZnO/STO thin film was formed with a ZnO buffer layer deposited at a high 
temperature. This result is consistent with the crystalline quality of ZnO/STO thin films from XRD patterns. 
Moreover, the rough surface structure and the distortion of ZnO lattice from the STO substrate might further 
increase the density of crystalline defects in the ZnO film without a ZnO buffer layer. This explains that a 
poor optical property of the ZnO/STO thin film without a ZnO buffer layer with respect to that of the 
ZnO/STO thin film with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown at 600oC. The PL results show that a high-quality 
epitaxial (110)-oritented ZnO thin film that emits UV light at room temperature can be formed on STO 
substrate with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown at an adequate temperature.  
Figure 6 shows the XRD patterns of BST thin films grown on ZnO/STO substrates at 600 and 700oC. 
These XRD patterns reveal Bragg peaks corresponding to the perovskite-structured BST phase. The 
as-deposited BST thin films on ZnO layers showed a randomly oriented crystallographic feature. The (110) 
orientation dominates the crystallographic feature in the polycrystalline BST thin films. The BST thin film 
grown at 600oC had a higher full width at half maximum (FWHM) value and a lower (110) Bragg reflection 
intensity than the BST film grown at 700oC. As the growth temperature reached 700oC, the FWHM value 
decreased and (1 1 0) Bragg reflection intensity increased. A higher growth temperature resulted in a higher 
crystalline quality of the BST thin film. Notably, the BST thin film grown at 700 oC exhibited a clear shift in 
the Bragg peak to a relatively lower position compared to that grown at 600 oC. This might be attributed to 
more oxygen vacancies or defects in the BST thin film grown at a higher temperature [23]. 
Figure 7 shows the SIMS depth profiles of BST thin films grown on the ZnO-coated STO substrates at 
600 and 700oC. Comparatively, the SIMS depth profiles of the BST thin film grown at 600 oC reveal a 
compositionally sharper interface between the dielectric BST film and the ZnO layer. The compositional 
profiles at the BST-ZnO interface became broader as the growth temperature increased to 700oC. This may be 
because a high growth temperature induced interdiffusion between the constituent oxide compounds. 
Figure 8 shows the dielectric constant of the BST films. The dielectric properties are dispersed in the 
higher frequency region for the film grown at 700oC. The BST film grown at 600oC has a lower dielectric 
constant with respect to that of the BST film grown at 700oC. Comparatively, the smaller grain size in the 
BST film grown at 600oC leads to a larger grain boundary area, and the associated interfacial capacitor is also 
a major contributing factor to low dielectric constant. The same phenomenon has also been reported in the 
literature [24]. The BST film grown at higher temperature shows a larger dielectric loss; this might result from 
a higher defect density in the film deposited at a higher temperature as exhibited from XRD results. Moreover, 
a rough interface between the BST layer and ZnO layer might also contribute to a high dielectric loss.  
Figure 9 shows the leakage current–voltage characteristics of the BST films deposited at various 
temperatures. The relatively low leakage current density was found for the BST film deposited at 600oC. 
Several factors have been reported to play roles on the leakage behavior of dielectric oxide thin films. The 
grain boundary was the conduction path of the leakage current in the polycrystalline high-dielectric oxide 
films. The relatively small grains block the short-cut routes in the films, reducing the leakage current in the 
dielectric thin films [25]. Moreover, the possible formation of interfacial layer due to the atomic interdiffusion 
between the BST and ZnO might deteriorate the leakage current performance of the high-temperature 
deposited BST thin film; the same phenomenon has been proposed in the other material systems [26-27].

The 16th International Conference on Crystal Growth (ICCG-16) in conjunction with 
The 14th International Conference on Vapor Growth and Epitaxy(ICVGE-14) will be 
held together 
August 8-13, 2010, Beijing, China 
The 16th International Conference on Crystal Growth (ICCG-16) will be held together with the 14th 
International Conference on Vapor Growth and Epitaxy (ICVGE-14) in ancient and modern city Beijing, the 
capital of China. The conference site is Beijing International Convention Center(BICC) in walking distance to 
the Beijing National Stadium (Bird Nest) built for the 29th Summer Olympics. The conference is hosted by 
Chinese Association for Crystal Growth under the supervision of the International Organization of Crystal 
Growth. 
This conference will provide an ideal forum for the presentations and discussions of recent 
developments and achievements in all respects of crystal growth: in bulk, thin film, or nano-crystalline state, 
with various sessions integrating fundamental, experimental and industrial growth processes, characterization 
and applications. It will also help to stimulate the review of historical theory and the practice to test new ideas 
in informal social activities. The current worldwide society has a great demand to photo voltaic (PV) based 
renewable energy. One of the key elements in PV industry is the growth ofmaterials (bulk/thick film/film) 
using the improved or newly developed crystal growth technologies through understanding new phenomena 
arising from the needs for the growth of cost effective and high quality materials.  To seek a sustainable, 
energy saving and/or cooperative society we strongly feel it is our responsibility to promote the international 
crystal growth society through playing the vital role in the development of new crystal growth technologies. 
A vendor exhibition will also allow participants to interact with various manufactures of equipments for 
crystal growth and characterization, as well as material supply and books. 
The conference will focus on a wide range of crystal growth science and technology. It will include 
both oral and poster sessions, as well as plenary and invited talks to provide broad visions of developments in 
different fields. The official language will be English as usual.

Abstract 
Nonpolar a-plane ZnO thin films were deposited on the single-crystal perovskite SrTiO3 (100) substrates 
at 750℃by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The effects of ultrathin 30 nm-thick ZnO buffer layer 
grown at 300-600℃ on the physical properties of ZnO/SrTiO3(STO) thin films are investigated. A high 
growth temperature of ZnO buffer layer enhances not only the (110)-texture of ZnO/STO thin films but also 
the crystalline quality of the film. However, the ZnO/STO thin film without a ZnO buffer lyaer has a poor 
crystalline quality comparing to those with the ZnO buffer layer. Atomic force microscopy morphology 
studies reveal that the thin ZnO buffer layer largely decreases the surface roughness of the ZnO/STO films. 
This may be because of the thin ZnO buffer layer effectively decreases the stress between the ZnO and STO. 
The results of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence 
spectra show that a high-quality epitaxial ZnO(110)/STO(100) thin film that emits UV light at room 
temperature can be formed with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown at 600℃.

(110) Bragg peak of ZnO thin films increases with growth temperature of the thin ZnO buffer layer. However, 
the (110) Bragg peak of the ZnO/STO thin film without a buffer layer has a relatively low intensity in 
comparison with that of ZnO/STO thin film with a ZnO buffer layer. A tiny (002) Bragg peak of ZnO was 
observed for the ZnO/STO films with a thin ZnO buffer layer grown below 600oC, revealing these ZnO/STO 
thin films have mixed crystallographic characteristics. The texture coefficient is defined as the intensity ratio 
I(110)/[I(002)+I(110)] of ZnO Bragg reflections. The ZnO/STO thin films without and with a ZnO buffer 
layer that was grown at 600oC exhibit pure (110) Bragg reflections. These ZnO/STO films have a pure 
(110)-oriented crystallographic feature. Moreover, the ZnO/STO thin films with a ZnO buffer layer grown at 
300 and 450oC have texture coefficients of 96.2 and 98.1%, respectively, revealing a very small portion of 
(002)-oriented grains in the ZnO/STO thin films. A relatively low surface mobility of the atomic species 
during thin ZnO buffer layer deposition at a low temperature might result in the formation of grains with 
mixed crystallographic features. This might account for the non-perfect (110)-orientation ZnO/STO thin films 
were formed with a ZnO buffer layer grown below 600oC. The bulk ZnO has a hexagonal structure with 
lattice parameters a=0.3249 nm and c=0.5206 nm. The STO substrate is cubic with a=0.3905 nm [6]. In ZnO 
(110)/STO (100) system, Karger et al. proposed that the lattice misfit in the ZnO film plane along the [-110] 
direction is~1.9% [10]. The lattice spacing of (110) Bragg reflection of the ZnO/STO thin films can be 
derived from Fig. 1(a). The lattice spacing of ZnO (110) plane for the ZnO/STO thin films with a ZnO buffer 
layer grown at various temperatures are the same (0.1641 nm). However, that of the ZnO/STO thin film 
without a ZnO buffer layer has a relatively small value of 0.1634 nm. The misfit between the ZnO and STO 
might cause a compressive strain in the ZnO film. The relatively small lattice spacing of (110) for the 
ZnO/STO thin film without a ZnO buffer layer might indicate that the ZnO buffer layer helps to release the 
lattice strain of thick ZnO film on the STO substrate. The use of buffer layer to reduce lattice misfit strain has 
been reported in ZnO thin films grown on sapphire or other single-crystalline substrates [9,11]. Figure 1(b) 
plots the full widths at half maxima (FWHM) of (110) Bragg reflections from ZnO thin films. The FWHM 
value of ZnO (110) clearly decreases from 0.98 to 0.41o for the ZnO/STO thin films with the growth 
temperature of ZnO buffer layer increases from 300 to 600oC. A ZnO buffer layer that was grown at a high 
growth temperature results in a large grain size by decreasing the density of nucleation sites and lowering the 
dislocation density [12]. Moreover, a high temperature deposited ZnO buffer layer has a high degree of 
(110)-oriented grains in the film further enhancing not only the (110)-oriented feature of the ZnO/STO thin 
film but also its crystalline quality. In contrast, the FWHM of (110)-oriented ZnO/STO thin film without a 
ZnO buffer layer has a relatively large value (0.69o) comparing to that of the (110)-oriented ZnO/STO thin 
film with a ZnO buffer layer. The lattice strain may increase the mosaicity in the ZnO/STO thin film without a 
ZnO buffer layer [11]. The XRD analysis herein shows that a highly crystalline quality of (110)-oriented 
ZnO/STO thin film can be grown at a sufficiently high growth temperature of the ZnO buffer layer.  
As depicted in Fig. 2, the epitaxial nature of the ZnO/STO thin film with a ZnO buffer layer grown at 
600oC is demonstrated by the in-plane orientations for (100) Bragg reflections of ZnO and (112) Bragg 
reflections of STO. No other peak is observable in intervals between these four peaks. This observation might 
be due to an existence of two kinds of growth domain perpendicular to each other in (110) ZnO grown on 
STO [13]. The same phenomenon has been observed in ZnO(110)/LaAlO3(100) system [14].  
The TEM images of ZnO/STO thin film with a ZnO buffer layer grown at 600oC was recorded with an 
incident electron beam parallel to <110> STO. Low-resolution cross-sectional TEM image (Fig. 3(a)) of ZnO 
 10
mixed crystallographic orientation when the ZnO buffer layers were grown at a temperature below 600oC. 
Moreover, those grown without the buffer layer and with the high-temperature-deposited ZnO buffer layer 
(600oC) exhibit a (110)-oriented crystallographic feature. The crystalline quality of ZnO/STO thin films 
increases with the growth temperature of the ZnO buffer layer. The ZnO/STO thin film without the ZnO 
buffer layer exhibits the worst crystalline quality and the roughest surface structure among all the samples. 
Both structural analyses and PL results show that an epitaxial ZnO(110)/STO(100) thin film of high 
crystalline quality that emits UV light at room temperature can be formed with a ZnO buffer layer grown at 
600oC. The integration of high quality epitaxial ZnO semiconductor with high-k dielectric perovskite 
substrates may lead to the applications of novel optoelectronic devices.

本研究計畫利用同質緩衝層的概念成功的在 750℃成長出高品質磊晶纖鋅礦氧化鋅於鈣鈦
礦鈦酸鍶上，藉由同質緩衝層的作用可以消除整合氧化鋅/鈦酸鍶異質結構的晶格形變進
而提升材料的物理特性。此外對於濺鍍成長之介電-半導體(鈦酸鍶鋇-氧化鋅)複合薄膜之
顯微結構特性、電性與成長溫度之關連性亦有完整之建立與討論。相研究成果證實藉由適
當掌控此類異質顯微結構可以進而調控複合材料之物理特性。研究成果有助於開發高性能
寬能隙氧化鋅磊晶薄膜元件並進而開發製作創新功能性複合纖鋅礦-鈣鈦礦氧化物電子元
件。本研究計畫成果已獲接受刊登於 SCI 國際期刊論文，而基於本計畫衍生之成果亦擴充
其它研究方向發表多篇國際 SCI 篇期刊論文。總計於本研究計畫有限的經費補助下排除實
驗設備短缺之困境總共發表 4篇 SCI 期刊論文，以遠超過當初預期之 2篇目標值，研究成
果斐然。所發表之論文如下所列：
