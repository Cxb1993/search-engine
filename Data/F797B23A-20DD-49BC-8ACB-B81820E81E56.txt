field (DF) image, taken using (3 01)L1m-D2 reflection
corresponding to Fig. 1(a), is shown in Fig. 1(c). In this
image, the deformation twin L1m monoclinic structure,
which is in bright contrast to a twinned plane (3 01)L1m-
D2 monoclinic martensite, can be distinctly observed in
the early phase transformation. As shown in Fig. 1(c),
the twins are coarse and irregular and thus can be
identified as deformation twins [7]. The modulated
(wave-like) tiny structures contained within the
deformation twins are identified as initial transformation
twins [6-7]. Figure 1(d) is an essential SADP with a
[111]L1m zone axis obtained by carefully tilting the
same sample. The measured angles (clockwise: 55.0ºm;
66.8°m; 57.5°m) among the reciprocal lattice vectors
from the SADP are shown in Fig. 1(d). The angles
cannot be identified as a tetragonal L10 structure, for
neither αbct nor γfcc phase fit these angles (clockwise:
55.0ºm; 66.8°m; 57.5°m), but only an L1m monoclinic
martensitic structure with lattice parameters of a = 3.242
Å, b = 3.756 Å, c = 3.104 Å, and β= 91.816º fits the
condition for the angles of SADPs. For confirmation of
the measured angles being L1m monoclinic martensitic
structure, we used the above lattice parameters and
calculated the interplanar spacings and the angles
between the chosen reciprocal reflections from the
following equations (a) and (b); The calculated
interplanar spacings and angles are listed in Tables І and 
П, and the calculated angles (clockwise:55.6ºc; 66.6°c;
57.8°c) are also shown in Fig. 1(d) for comparison. It
can be found in Tables І and П that the measured values 
from SADPs are perfectly consistent with those
obtained by calculated values from equations(a) and (b)
[8]. Based on these results, therefore, the other
diffraction patterns of L1m monoclinic martensite in this
paper could all be indexed.

Figures 2(a)-(d) are a series of enlarged TEM
micrographs obtained from the second sample by
choosing the different banded morphology. The long
parallel bands contained within the L1m-D deformation
twins are shown in the BF image of Fig. 2(a), in which a
finer plate, with a more closely-spaced parallel array
and more regular banded morphology than the
deformation twins, is believed to be the L1m-T
transformation twins. An SADP taken from a local
transformation twins (L1m-T) region, marked with circle
in Fig. 2(a), is shown in Fig. 2(b). By careful analysis of
the SADP, it is found that the tetragonal {11 1}L10
plane nucleates along the (101)L1m-T of monoclinic
twin structure. In Fig. 2(b), the orientation relationship

stoichiometric L10+αbct structure. An SADP taken from
high magnification of the separated morphology is
shown in Fig. 4(b), in which the zone axis reveals

denotes stoichiometric L10 structure; hkl denotes αbct
structure with lattice parameters of a = 2.894 Å, c =
2.876 Å, and c/a = 0.994). The DF image using (121)L10
reflection corresponding to Fig. 4(b) is shown in Fig.
4(c), in which the bright contrast is the phase
decomposition stoichiometric L10 structure. The phase
separated L10 structure with a stoichiometric and a
primitive lattice type belongs to a second order phase.
The DF image using (110)αbctreflection corresponding
to Fig. 4(b) is shown in Fig. 4(d), in which the bright
contrast is the αbct phase. Analysis of the microstructures
(Figs. 4(c) and (d)) confirms unambiguously the
existence of two phases (i.e. αbct and stoichiometric L10
structure) in the phase decomposition morphology. The
L1m-T+L10 → stoichiometric L10+αbct is a
non-thermoelastic phase transition. However, the
appearance of the stoichiometric L10 andαbct martensite
deteriorates the magnetostrictive strains, which will be
confirmed later by magnetostriction measurements
using the strain gauge method.
Figures 5(a)-(d) are a series of SEM images
obtained from the alloys ST and aged at 475 ℃ for 19
h. Shown in Fig. 5(a) is the SEM image taken from the
ST condition that indicating the existence of lamellar
structures can be ascribed to the anisotropic plastic
behavior of lamellar colonies [11-12]. Figure 5(b) is the
SEM image of the alloys ST and aged at 475 ℃ for 19

reorientation of the L1m-T+L10 martensite twin structure.
In addition, analysis of Fig. 7 also reveals that the ST
sample has a near saturated magnetostriction with a
small applied field (H║ = 2500 Oe, with a close field
value resemblance of M-H curve) parallel to the
sample’s longitude, and has a high value of 
magnetostrictive susceptibility (λ║s/H).
3. Conclusions
1. TEM and SEM investigations confirm two types of
twins in the alloys during ST and after ST and aging
at 475 ℃ for 19 h. The two kinds of twins are
comprised of monoclinic L1m deformation twins
(L1m-D) and L1m transformation twins (L1m-T). The
orientation relationship between L1m-T and L1m-D can
be demonstrated as [010]L1m-T//[133]L1m-D.
2. The L10 tetragonal martensite nucleates along a finer
plate, with a more closely-spaced parallel array of
{101}L1m-T monoclinic transformation twins. The
orientation relationships between the L10 tetragonal
martensite and L1m-T monoclinic transformation
twins can be illustrated as [011]L10//[121]L1m-T and
(11 1)L10//(101)L1m-T; [1 01]L10//[32 3]L1m-T and
(121)L10//(101)L1m-T; respectively.
3. TEM, SEM, VSM, and magnetostrictive strain
investigations reveal that when the alloys are ST and
then aged at 475 ℃ for 19 h, the decomposition of
L10+L1m-T phases into the stoichiometric L10+αbct
structures leads to an increase of coercivity and a
destruction of magnetostriction, simultaneously.
4. The orientation relationship between αbct and
stoichiometric L10 martensite can be demonstrated as
[001]αbct //[412]L10 and (020)αbct//(121)L10.

heat-treating materials with such high temperatures generates
solid solution strengthening. As might be inferred in Fig. 2, the
solid solution strengthening effect is small because of the Rh
atom substitution for Pd atom, the atomic sizes of which are
similar (RRh = 1.342 Å, RPd = 1.375 Å), and the crystal
structures are also the same FCC structure. In addition, doping
the Fe-30Pd alloy system with Rh causes a decrease in L10
nucleation free energy, allowing easier generation of L10 phase.
Rh substitution for Pd also enhances the L10 phase formation
in the Fe-30Pd alloy system, as reported in a previously
published paper [2].
B. Microstructure Investigation
Figure 3(a) is an SEM micrograph taken normal to the
forged direction of the sample strain-forged to a ~45%
reduction in thickness. Indicated by the arrow is strain-induced
lamellar structures. The existence of lamellar structures can be
ascribed to the anisotropic plastic behavior of lamellar
colonies [3]. The strain-forged loading axis (i.e., forging
direction) is perpendicular to the lamellar boundaries, so the
yield stress is high. In this forging direction, the deformation
must propagate through the lamellar interfaces [3]-[4]. Figure
3(b) shows an SEM image taken from the areas parallel to the
forged direction (i.e., cross section region). In this direction,
the lamellar boundaries are either inclined at an intermediate
angle to the loading axis (i.e., the forging direction) or parallel
to the loading axis. In the former condition, the lamellar
colonies are easily deformed by shear parallel to the interfacial
planes, and the yield stress is low. In the latter case, the
lamellar boundaries are parallel to the loading axis, and the
yield stress is moderately high. The slip bands along the {101}
plane are also clearly observed in the SEM image, as shown in
Fig. 3(b), indicated by an arrow. Figure 3(c) is a TEM bright-
field (BF) image taken from the strain-induced lamellar
structures. The microstructures of the BF image consist of
deformed lamellar grains (and elongated subgrains) containing
a high density of dislocations at the grain boundary. A TEM
selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) taken from the
corresponding BF micrograph is shown in Fig. 3(d). Careful
analysis of the SADP reveals the orientation relationship
[110]L10//[100]L1m (hkl denotes tetragonal L10 structure; hkl
denotes monoclinic phase). The SADP indicates that two
phases exist in the strain-induced lamellar structures, which are
comprised of tetragonal L10 structure and monoclinic L1m
phase. In order to verify two phases comprised of the strain-
forged lamellar structures, further TEM images are taken from
second sample. Shown in Fig. 4(a) is [100]L10//[41 3]L1m zone
axis SADP. In such zone axis, the two-phase structures are
clearly revealed in the diffraction pattern spots. A bright field
image corresponding to Fig. 4(a) is shown in Fig. 4(b). The
deformed lamellar grains (and elongated subgrains) as well as
dislocation tangles appear very sharp in the BF image. Figure
4(c) is a dark field image using the (002)L10 reflection
corresponding to Fig. 4(a). It is found that the lamellar bright
strip is a deformed L10 structure which is ferromagnetic. The

the bright contrast is a monoclinic L1m phase. A comparison of
Fig. 4(c) with 4(d) reveals distinct difference in the
microstructures between the L10 phase and L1m structure.
Analysis of the microstructures (Fig. 4(c) with 4(d)) confirms
unambiguously the existence of two phases in the strain-forged
lamellar structure again. Figure 5(a) is an SEM image taken

and quenching in ice brine. In this SEM micrograph, the ultra

C. Magnetic Property
Figure 7(a) shows the magnetization (M) versus magnetic
field strength (H) M-H curves, measured at room temperature,
of the strain-forged sample after annealing at 1050 ℃ for 1.5 h
and quenching in ice brine. H// denotes the magnetic applied
field parallel to the sample's longitude, and Hdenotes the
magnetic applied field normal to the sample's longitude (i.e.,
perpendicular to the sample's cross section region). As shown
in Fig. 7(a), the sample annealed at 1050 ℃ for 1.5 h with
complete recrystallization appears magnetically soft. The
hysteresis loops, revealing the saturation magnetization (Ms)
values of the magnetic moment per unit mass, are Ms = 152.54
(emu/g) for H//, and Ms = 121.71 (emu/g) for H, respectively.
Analysis of Fig. 7(a) shows that the sample has become
saturated in the applied field (H// = 2500 Oe) parallel to the
sample's longitude, with a high value of magnetic
susceptibility κ= M/H. On the contrary, a larger field (H=
10000 Oe) has to be applied to the specimen perpendicular to
the longitude for the saturation magnetization. Therefore, this
magnetic behavior demonstrates a low magnetic susceptibility
κ. The above magnetic property has a typical
magnetocrystalline anisotropy with a shape anisotropy as
described by B. D. Cullity [10]. The value of the magnetic
anisotropy constant from equation K1 = Ms×Hk /
2……………………(1) (where Ms: saturation magnetization,
Hk: anisotropy field, with density ρ = 8.1746 g/cm3) is
obtained as follows: K1// = 1.56×106 (ergs/cm3), and K1=
4.97×106 (ergs/cm3). The M-H curves, measured at room
temperature, of the strain-forged sample after being solution-
treated (ST) at 1050 ℃ for 1.5 h and aged at 475 ℃ for 100 h
are shown in Fig. 7(b). The hysteresis loops reveal a
magnetically hard behavior with a coercivity Hc = 800-1000
Oe, and the saturation magnetization (Ms) values of the
magnetic moment per unit mass are Ms = 133.50 (emu/g) for
H//, and Ms = 110.48 (emu/g) for H. The magnetic anisotropy
constants K1 from equation (1) are calculated as follows: K1//
= 4.09×106 (ergs/cm3), and K1 = 4.52×106 (ergs/cm3),
respectively. Analysis of Fig. 7(b), shows that the magnetic
susceptibility κof applied field (H//) parallel to the sample's
longitude is higher than that of the applied field (H) normal
to the sample's longitude for the saturation magnetization.
Figure 7(b) also reveals that the sample aged at 475 ℃ for
(a) (b)
Fig. 7. Magnetization (M) versus magnetic field (H) M-H curves measured at
room temperature (RT) of the Fe-30Pd-2Rh alloys: (a) strain-forged sample
after solution-treatment (ST) at 1050 ℃ for 1.5 h and quenched in ice brine,
(b) ST thermally aged at 475℃ for 100 h.
100 h possesses a superior coercivity to that of the ST
specimen (Fig. 7(a)). This is ascribed to the much greater
amount of ferromagnetic precipitates of the L1m phase and L10
structure appearing in the aged specimen.
III. CONCLUSIONS
1. The SEM micrograph demonstrates that ultra fine grain
sizes (< ASTM G. S. 10 #) result from recrystallization of
the strain-forged sample via annealing at 950 ℃ for 3 h or
1050℃ for 1.5 h followed by quenching in ice brine.
2. The plastic micro-indentation in the Vickers microhardness
test illustrates that the process of recrystallization has
resulted in the ultra fine grains having increased ductility.
3. TEM investigation indicates two types of twins in the
strain-forged sample after annealing at 950 ℃ for 3 h. The
two twins are comprised of deformation twins and
transformation twins.
4. The increase in ductility, magnetic anisotropy, and twins
may make the alloy useful in magneto-mechanical
applications.
