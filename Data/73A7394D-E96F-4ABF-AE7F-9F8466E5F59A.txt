英文摘要 
Amorphous InGaZnO thin-film transistor 
(a-IGZO TFT) has good uniformity, high 
mobility（μ＝10~100 cm2v-1s-1）, high current 
ON/OFF ratio (>107), potentially to be the key 
technology for next generation high-quality plat 
panel display, especially in large-scale 
active-matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD) 
and active-matrix organic light emitting display 
(AMOLED). Another breakthrough technology 
of a-IGZO TFT is to achieve system on panel 
(SOP). This means that periphery circuits, key 
devices, driving circuits and memory all 
integrated on glass substrate. The system 
nonvolatile memory (NVM) is the key 
component to realize the system on panel. In this 
project, we base on our previous successful 
experience in poly-Si TFT and its Nonvolatile 
Memory to research the emerging a-IGZO TFT 
and a-IGZO NVM.  In this second year project, 
we fabricate and study the TFT and NVM with 
a-IGZO channel, and tri-gate NWs SONOS 
structure NVM with IGZO trapping layer. In 
a-IGZO TFT, high-K (SiO2/Si3N4/SiO2) stack 
layers as gate insulator is addressed. In a-IGZO 
NVM, we will focus on the various 
program/erase mechanism. In the tri-gate NWs 
SONOS-structure NVM with IGZO trapping 
layer, the Program/erase speed and reliability are 
addressed. This project will help to realize next 
generation high-quality flat panel display and 
SOP. This research also can be applied on 3-D 
CMOS stacked circuits. Thus, this project has 
both highly academic and commercial values

Preface (前言) 
Thin film transistor has been widely used in 
commercial products such as television, 
computer screen, cell phone, etc. The TFT 
commercial products can be categorized based 
on their applications. For a portable device with 
a small display panel (e.g. cell phone, camera), 
Low-Temperature Poly-silicon (LTPS) TFTs are 
candidate to use. The advantages of the LTPS 
TFT are low temperature fabrication, which is 
suitable for glass substrate; high mobility, 
depending on its grain size; and good reliability. 
The grain size of the LTPS TFT, however, is not 
uniform. The LTPS TFT has its limit in 
application of large display panel.

layers were deposited by sputtering. The 
dielectrics (SiO2/Si3N4/SiO2) and passivation 
layer are deposited by PECVD. Figure 1 scheme 
the bottom gate structure of this TFT device. The 
thickness of each layer is marked in Fig. 1.as the 
trapping layer, and we study the tri-gate poly-Si 
nanowires (NWs) NVM with a-IGZO trapping 
layer.  
Figure 2 exhibits the transfer curve of this 
IGZO channel high-κ dielectric TFT device. 
Low subthreshold swing, 400 mV/dec, and high 
Ion/Ioff ratio, approximately 106 order, are 
obtained in this TFT device. Additionally, this 
TFT device does not behave the 
drain-induced-barrier lowering (DIBL) in 
different drain voltage. This is because the size 
of this TFT device is large.  
Figure 3 shows the Id-Vd curve of this 
IGZO channel high-κ dielectric TFT device. A 
very high Ion is obtained in this device. The Ion is 
on the order of 105 ampere. The high current of 
this device is enough to achieve the gate driving 
device; therefore, this device has a feasibility to 
be applied in SOP application.  
 
II. IGZO channel NVM 
We perform the SONOS type NVM with 
IGZO channel. Because of the bottom gate 
structure, the first SiO2 layer is thicker than that 
of the second layer (the second layer SiO2 is the 
tunnel oxide). Because the SiO2 is deposited by a 
low temperature PECVD, the quality of the SiO2 
is not good. A thick tunneling oxide is required 
to obtain a better reliability. 
Figure 4 shows the program characteristic 
of this IGZO channel and SONOS type NVM. 
This device is programmed by Fowler-Norheim 
(F-N) tunneling. Several programming bias are 
applied to this NVM device.

  A 2 V of memory window can be achieved by 
applying a pulse at the gate electrode with 28 V 
and 0.1 second. Low programming speed can be 
explained by two reasons: First, the thickness of 
the tunnel oxide is very thick (15 nm). Second, 
because of the bottom gate structure, thicker 
blocking oxide than tunnel oxide, and a planar 
TFT structure, the coupling ratio is smaller than

Fig. 7. Id-Vg transfer characteristics of fresh 
tri-gate and conventional devices with a NC 
IGZO charge trapping layer. Both devices

for 1 sec from programmed state. 
 
slope (SS) of tri-gate and conventional devices 
are 195 and 210 mV/dec, respectively. The 
tri-gate device reveals better transistor 
characteristics due to superior gate control of 
tri-gate structure [16].  
Figure 8 plots the P/E characteristics of 
tir-gate and conventional devices. The 
programming operations use F-N tunneling 
mechanism at Vgs= 11 and 15 V with grounded 
S/D from erased state of Vth = -1 V. The erasing 
operations also use F-N tunneling mechanism at 
Vgs= -11 and -15 V with the grounded S/D from 
programmed state of Vth = 4.4 V. The results in 
Fig. 3 indicate tri-gate device has higher F-N P/E 
efficiency than that of conventional device 
because of corner effect [17], [16]. Both tir-gate 
and conventional devices exhibit high P/E 
speeds due to extra high density traps on large 
surface area of NCs. Additionally, it is 
noteworthy that the erasing speed of the poly-Si 
memory with the IGZO charge trapping layer is 
very fast. These characteristics totally differ 
from those of the previously studied NVMs 
which use a-IGZO as an active channel and a 
charge trapping layer. The NVMs with the 
a-IGZO channel exhibit very poor F-N erasing 
characteristics [18]-[20]. Since the a-IGZO 
thin-film as the ionic bond, the conducting 
electrons are arisen from oxygen

vacancies. Therefore, the a-IGZO thin-film 
exhibits n-type conductivity and lack of holes 
[12]. In other words, in F-N erasing operation, 
much larger gate voltage is needed to form the 
hole inversion layer for supplying tunneling 
current in the a-IGZO channel. This shortage of 
holes in the a-IGZO active channel results in 
very slow F-N erasing characteristics. Added to 
these mentioned above, the stored electrons of 
IGZO charge trapping layer are trapped under 
the conduction band at programmed state, which 
also explains the extremely slow erasing speed 
[20], [21]. However, in this study, the active 
channel is undoped poly-Si thin-film and much 
easier to form inversion layer for supplying hole. 
This characteristic allows a high F-N erasing 
speed for nonvolatile memory. For further 
demonstrating the charge storage capability of 
the NC IGZO charge trapping layer, the 
programming characteristic of control sample, a 
tri-gate TFT ( W / L = 67 nm × 10 / 1 μm ) with 
single 26-nm tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) 
oxide gate dielectric is also presented and it is 
absence of Vth shift.

and conventional devices measured at room 
temperature and 85 oC. The memory windows of 
tri-gate and conventional devices sustain 72 %

 以非晶銦鎵鋅氧化物(IGZO)半導體通道(channel)之高介電常數(high-k)電晶體具有高驅動電
流(Ion)，高載子遷移率(mobility)，以及不錯的次臨界擺幅(SS)。然而於非揮發性記憶體
(nonvolatile memory)應用方面，由於非晶銦鎵鋅氧化物半導體，本質上缺少可移動之電洞
(hole)，因此無法使用 F-N 穿隧，將電洞穿隧至氮化矽做記憶體抹除操作。藉由瞭解到 IGZO 薄膜
之物理特性，進一步地，我們改研發以複晶矽薄膜 (poly-Si thin-film)作為通道層，並以非晶銦
鎵鋅氧化物做電荷儲存層，之上閘極複晶矽之非揮發性記憶體。由於具有複晶矽薄膜富含電洞，因
此具有良好的寫抹(P/E)能力。採用非晶銦鎵鋅氧化物做缺陷儲存層，具有離散缺陷(discrete
