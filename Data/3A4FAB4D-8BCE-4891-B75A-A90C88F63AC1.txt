中文摘要 
在前期計畫，我們曾經成功地將複材機翼結構模擬成複合夾心板並建立一完整
之數學模式。 在此模式中，伸張、彎曲及偶合勁度不僅與機翼蒙皮之複材層板相關
且與翼桁樑(stringer)及翼樑凸緣(spar flange)相關。 而翼肋(wing rib)與翼樑肋(spar 
web)之安排則被視為夾心板之心材，並以均佈概念計算等效之橫向剪力模數。 利用
這些估算之材料性質，整體複材機翼結構之模擬考慮了彎矩-扭矩偶合、翹曲限制、
橫向剪應變、翼形函數、轉動慣量等效應。 由於考慮的因素較多，為避免問題之複
雜化在前期計畫中我們引進了矩陣表示法，其結果使得許多原本極為複雜的方程式
擁有與傳統樑理論一樣之數學型式。 由於此一相似性，我們相信許多應該相當複雜
的問題都可延用傳統樑理論的概念處理。 因此在本期計畫我們繼續前期的成果更進
一步地探討複材機翼結構之自由振動與受力振動等動態行為，並針對相關例子輔以
商用有限元素法分析軟體來加以比較、驗證。 同時也著手進行類神經網路法的改善
工作。 這些結果已如預期為後續工作奠定良好基礎。在本計畫之第一年，我們將複
材機翼結構模擬成複合夾心板並以矩陣表示法將原本極為複雜的方程式改寫成擁有
與傳統樑理論一樣之數學型式。 由於此一相似性，許多應該相當複雜的問題都可延
用傳統樑理論的概念處理，也因此可以探討複材機翼結構之自由振動與受力振動等
動態行為。 第二年則繼續第一年的成果更進一步地探討：機翼材料機械性質之線上
量測、複合夾心樑與複材機翼結構之減振控制等問題。第三年亦即本計畫之最後一
年則以複材機翼結構之最佳化設計、及感測器與制動器之最適安置與設計，為計畫
之目標，所有預期完成之工作皆已順利完成。

comprehensive model as well as the simplicity of 
the classical beam model, in this project we 
re-derive the comprehensive model into a simple 
and elegant form by using the matrix form 
representation. Due to its simplicity, the vibration 
analysis by the comprehensive model, which is 
expected to be complicated, now becomes as 
simple as that of classical beam model.  
To show the accuracy and generality of the 
comprehensive dynamic model for the vibration 
analysis of the stiffened composite multicell wing 
structures, several illustrative examples are given 
such as a bending-torsion coupled cantilever 
composite beam, a cantilever composite sandwich 
beam, a NACA 2412 composite wing. Moreover, 
the influential factors on the natural frequencies, 
such as the transverse shear deformation, warping 
restraint, shape of airfoil are all studied by this 
unified and general formulation. An example for 
the forced vibration analysis is then given by the 
vibration suppression of composite wing with 
piezoelectric sensors and actuators bonded on the 
wing surfaces, for which a LQG/LTR controller is 
designed and proved to be successful for vibration 
suppression of composite wings. 
In addition to the vibration analysis of 
composite wing structures, for the study of on-line 
measurement of next year in this year we also 
work on the improvement of neural network. 
 
2. Matrix Form Comprehensive Model 
The primary function of the wing structure is 
providing the lift for an aircraft, which is governed 
by the aerodynamic consideration. In addition to 
the aerodynamic pressure, there are other forces 
resisted by the wing structures such as the weight 
of the structures, fuels, engines, undercarriage 
system, and/or possible carried weapons, and the 
thrust of engines, etc. To sustain these loads, the 
wing structures usually consist of axial members in 
stringers, bending members in spars, shear panels 
in the cover skin and spar webs, and planar 
members in ribs. If the cover skin of the wing is 
made of the composite laminates, the entire wing 
structure may be simulated by a composite 
sandwich plate in which the wing skins and 
stringers (including the spar flanges) are simulated 
as the faces while the spar webs and ribs are 
simulated as the core of the sandwiches. Because 
the wing cross section must have a streamline 
shape commonly referred to as an airfoil section, 
the thickness of the sandwich will not be a 
constant but a function of the airfoil. Moreover, as 
the usual sandwich assumptions, the thickness is 
not too small to neglect the transverse shear 
deformation. Based upon these considerations, a 
mathematical model for the composite sandwich 
plates [22,23] has been applied by Hwu and Tsai 
[18] to model the stiffened composite multicell 
wing structures.  
Due to the closely spaced stringers and the 
transverse stiffening members like wing spars and 
ribs, in aircraft analysis it is usually assumed that 
the wing chordwise section is rigid [2]. The 
displacement field consistent with the 
chordwise-rigid postulation and the basic 
assumptions for the composite sandwich plates can 
be written as [18]

 According to the postulation given in (1), the

stiffened composite wing structures become

displacement field, the equations of motion for 
composite sandwich plates and the constitutive 
relations for laminated sandwiches, a matrix form 
comprehensive model has been established [24].

and the angular bracket <> stands for a diagonal 
matrix in which each component is varied 
according to its subscript i.    
Because both of the eigenvalues ir  and the 
eigenvectors id  are functions of the natural 
frequency ω , the coefficient matrix of k in (10a) 
is a function of the natural frequency ω . Again, 
non-vanishing solutions exist only when the 
determinant of the coefficient matrix of k becomes 
zero, by which we can then obtain the natural 
frequencies of the stiffened composite wing 
structures. With the determined natural frequency 
ω , the coefficients ik  can be calculated from 
(10a) as the eigenvector, and hence the natural 
vibration mode shapes of the composite wing 
structures are obtained from (9). 
 
Orthogonality Condition: 
If the family of natural vibration mode shapes 
)( yj∆  can constitute a complete set of 
orthonormal modes, most of the vibration 
problems can be solved by modal analysis through 
the use of the expansion theorem. Let iω  and 
jω be the two distinct natural frequencies and 
)( yi∆  and )( yj∆  be the corresponding natural 
modes of vibration resulting from the solution of 
the equations of motion (5) and its associated 
boundary conditions (3). It can be proved that [24] 
ij

j dy δ=∫0 0∆I∆ ,          (11) 
where ijδ  is the Kronecker delta. Unlike the 
usual orthogonality conditions that only the lateral 
deflection is considered, the orthogonality found in 
(11) shows that the complete set includes not only 
the mode shapes of the deflection but also the 
mode shapes of all the other basic functions. 
 
Forced Vibration 
After finding the orthogonality relation (11), 
the expansion theorem may be used to obtain the 
system response by modal analysis. Using the 
expansion theorem we write the solution of (2a) as 
a superposition of the natural modes 
)( yj∆ multiplying corresponding time-dependent 
generalized coordinates )(tjη . Hence,

4. Numerical Examples 
 Because the displacement fields assumed in 
(1) are quite general, as far as the authors’ 
knowledge no analytical solution for the vibration 
analysis has been provided in the literature. 
However, several special conditions have been 
discussed vastly in the literature. Therefore, in this 
project we first check our solutions by comparison 
with the existing numerical solutions for some 
special cases which can be reduced from our 
general formulation. After verification through the 
known results, we check the assumptions that the 
in-plane and rotary inertia terms can be 
disregarded for the cases of “absence of in-plane 
spanwise loads”. When these basic checks are 
done, we illustrate numerical results of natural 
frequencies and mode shapes of a NACA 2412 
composite wing. From this case, we study some 
influential factors such as transverse shear 
deformation, warping restraint, shape of airfoil, etc. 
Finally, through the analysis for forced vibration 
presented in this report, applications to vibration 
suppression of composite wing are also illustrated. 
Some of these numerical examples have been 
shown in [24,25] and some others are still under 
working for the cases of following topics such as 
on-line measurement of material properties, 
optimal placement of sensors and actuators, etc. 
Figures 1 and 2 are two typical results for the 
studies of influential factors.

Abstract 
On the first year of this project, a comprehensive 
model for the stiffened composite multicell wing 
structures has been developed and formulated in matrix 
form representation, which makes most of the equations 
bear the same form as those of the classical beam theory. 
Due to the similarity of the matrix form representation, 
it is very possible that the composite wing structures can 
be studied analytically by following the classical 
approach. Therefore, in the first year, the problems of 
free and forced vibration of composite wing structures 
have been solved analytically. With these results, in this 
year we go further to the topics such as on-line 
measurement of material properties for composite wing 
structures, vibration suppression for composite sandwich 
beams and composite wing structures, etc.. As expected, 
most of the works have been completed successfully.

1. Introduction 
Recently, the technologies of non-destructive 
evaluation have attracted more and more attention. 
These technologies play increasingly significant 
roles in maintenance of structures and in-service 
monitoring. However, most of them such as 
ultrasonics and X-ray are concerned with 
point-measurement using detectors to scan a 
specific area or a spatial region [1]. Obviously, it 
costs a lot of time to finish scanning procedures; 
besides, without any further analysis it can’t 
provide information about entire structures. To get 
global information of the structures, inverse 
analysis through optimization or neural network 
techniques is popularly used in the literature. To 
determine material properties, the commonly used 
detectors in the inverse analysis are natural 
frequencies, static strains and displacements, etc., 
[2-8]. Most of the researches dealt with simple 
plates; very few of them studied complicated 
structures such as composite wing structures 
discussed in this project. To study this kind of 
structures we utilize the comprehensive dynamic 
model developed previously [9] and finite element 
software ANSYS to compute natural frequencies 
and static strains as detectors. For an on-line and 
real-time demand, artificial neural networks are 
adopted to determine the material properties 
inversely. To show the feasibility and accuracy of 
the present inverse model, the experimental 
evaluation of material properties of NACA 2412 
composite wing is made by both the present and 
conventional methods. Comparison of their results 
shows that the material properties in fiber direction 
do well agree with each other. 
Besides the study of on-line measurement of 
material properties for the composite wing 
structures, in this project we also study the 
vibration suppression of composite sandwich- 
beams/wing-structures. We investigate smart 
composite sandwich-beams/wing-structures with 
surface bonded piezoelectric sensors and actuators. 
By combining the vibration analysis developed 
previously with the classical optimal control 
method, an observed-state feedback control system 
for the composite sandwich-beams/wing-structures 
is designed. Numerical examples of vibration 
suppression of cantilevered composite sandwich 
beams and NACA 2412 composite wings are 
implemented in this project, which show that their

3. Vibration Suppression 
Composite sandwich beams 
A mathematical model for the mechanical 
analysis of delaminated composite sandwich plates 
and beams was proposed by Hwu and Hu [12] for 
the buckling problems and by Hu and Hwu [13] 
for the vibration problems. According to their 
model, the equations of motion for the composite 
sandwich beams with the effects of rotary inertia 
and shear deformation included can be expressed 
as (see Figure 2)

are the transverse shear stiffness and bending 
stiffness whose values can be calculated from the 
material and section properties of the core and 
faces of the composite sandwich beams.

To know the natural frequency and its 
associated mode of vibration of the composite 
sandwich beams, we consider the case that the 
external load 0),( =txp , i.e., the problems of 
free vibration. To find the natural modes of 
vibration, the usual way is the method of 
separation of variables. By this method we write 
the deflection ),( txw  as a product of a function 
)(xW  of the spatial variables only and a function 
)(tf depending on time only. Furthermore, 
because of free vibration )(tf  is harmonic and of 
frequency ω . Thus,  
tiexWtxw ω)(),( = .           (4) 
Through the use of (4), the equation of motion (3) 
can easily be reduced to an ordinary differential 
equation and the general solutions for )(xW  can 
be obtained. To find the natural frequency and the 
mode shape, we need to set the boundary 
conditions. With the obtained general solution and 
the boundary conditions, the natural frequency and 
mode shape of the composite sandwich beams 
have been found in this project. Furthermore, an 
orthogonality condition which is important for the 
vibration analysis has also been obtained as

where ijδ  is the Kronecker delta. Unlike the 
usual orthogonality conditions for the cases that 
the effects of rotary inertia and shear deformation 
are neglected, the orthogonality found in (5) shows 
that the complete set includes not only the mode 
shapes of the deflection but also the slope angle. 
After finding the orthogonality relation (5), the 
expansion theorem may be used to obtain the 
system response by modal analysis. Using the 
expansion theorem we write the solution of (2) as a 
superposition of the natural modes )(xWj  and 
)(xB j  multiplying corresponding time-dependent 
generalized coordinates )(tjη . Hence,

where )(tN j denotes a generalized force associated 
with the generalized coordinate )(tjη  and is 
related to the transverse distributed load q by 
∫= L dxxWtxptN jj 0 )(),()( .      (7b) 
To suppress the vibration of the composite 
sandwich beams, we consider the popular way by 
bonding piezoelectric sensors and actuators on the 
surfaces of the beam. It is well known that 
piezoelectric materials produce an electric field 
when deformed and undergo deformation when 
subjected to an electric field. Due to this intrinsic 
 12
KBRG T1−= ,           (14a) 
where K satisfies the steady-state matrix Riccati 
equation, i.e., 
0KBKBRQKAKA T1 =−++ −T .   (14b) 
 To show the performance of the LQG/LTR 
controller designed in this project for the vibration 
suppression of composite sandwich beams, a 
cantilevered composite sandwich beam of the type [ ]score/0/0/90/90/0/0  is considered. Figure 3 
is an example showing the different suppression 
performance based upon the first mode and the first 
five modes. To monitor the vibration reduction 
effects, we use an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) 
analyzer through which the tip displacement 
frequency response of the sandwich beam is plotted 
in Figure 4. This figure shows that the LQG/LTR 
control does not change the first five natural 
frequencies but reduces the peak values of the first 
five modes. 
 
Composite wing structures 
 To study the vibration suppression of 
composite wing structures, we employ the same 
approach as that of composite sandwich beams. 
The difference of these two problems comes from 
the mathematical model of vibration analysis. By 
applying the comprehensive model developed last 
year for the stiffened composite multicell wing 
structures and following the steps described 
previously for the sandwich beams, a LQG/LTR 
controller is also designed for the composite wing 
structures. The numerical simulation for the 
vibration suppression of composite wing is shown 
in Figures 5(a) and (b). From these Figures we see 
that based upon the vibration analysis model 
developed in this project the LQG/LTR controller 
successfully suppresses the vibration of composite 
wing within 4 seconds.

Abstract 
On the first year of this project, a comprehensive 
model for the stiffened composite multicell wing 
structures has been developed and formulated in matrix 
form representation, which makes most of the equations 
bear the same form as those of the classical beam theory. 
Due to the similarity of the matrix form representation, 
it is very possible that the composite wing structures can 
be studied analytically by following the classical 
approach. Therefore, in the first year, the problems of 
free and forced vibration of composite wing structures 
have been solved analytically. With these results, in the 
second year we go further to the topics such as on-line 
measurement of material properties for composite wing 
structures, vibration suppression for composite sandwich 
beams and composite wing structures, etc.. In the third 
year which is the last year of this project, our targets are: 
optimal design of composite wing structures and optimal 
placement of sensors and actuators. As expected, all 
planned works have been completed successfully.

1. 複材機翼結構之最佳化設計 
複合材料種類很多，較被廣泛應用的屬纖
維補強之高分子複材，究其原因除了技術發展較
早之外，最大的優點是它的可設計性，藉由改變
纖維的組成與排向可以達到結構與材料最佳化
的目的。 在複材機翼結構最佳化設計的過程
中，一般多在某些限制條件(如最大變形、最大
應力、挫曲強度、破壞韌度、疲勞強度、發散速
度、顫振速度….等等)下尋求最小的重量。 假
如我們想利用前期對前掠翼機翼所探討的發散
問題進行最佳化的探討，我們可以設定最佳化問

Abstract
Structures will encounter degradation of material properties in changing service environments. To improve structural safety and pre-
vent accident, it is necessary to examine material properties of structures in nondestructive ways. Although several nondestructive eval-
uation techniques have been developed in the literature, most of them detect local damages not global material properties. In this paper,
an on-line and real-time detection system is developed through the concept of inverse analysis. In this system, the detectors are selected to
be natural frequencies and static strains whose relations with material properties can be obtained from analytical solution or commercial
ﬁnite element software or experimental data. Transferring their relations into training patterns of artiﬁcial neural networks, the elastic
properties of composite wing structures can be determined on-line with frequency and strain sensors embedded into structures. To illus-
trate this on-line measurement system, an example of NACA 2412 composite wing is provided in this paper. This example shows that the
material properties determined through this on-line system well agree with the values obtained from the conventional testing methods.
The diﬀerence is that the present method determines the properties on-line and real-time without cutting any specimen on the structures
and testing specimens in the laboratory.

1. Introduction
Recently, the technologies of nondestructive evalua-
tion have attracted more and more attention. These tech-
nologies play increasingly signiﬁcant roles in maintenance
of structures and in-service monitoring. However, most
of them such as ultrasonics and X-ray are concerned
with point-measurement using detectors to scan a speciﬁc
area or a spatial region [1]. Obviously, it costs a lot of
time to ﬁnish scanning procedures; besides, without any
further analysis it cannot provide information about en-
tire structures. To get global information of the struc-
tures, inverse analysis through optimization or neural
network techniques is popularly used in the literature.
To determine material properties, the commonly used
detectors in the inverse analysis are natural frequencies,
static strains and displacements, etc. Grediac and Paris
[2] investigated two-dimensional anisotropic plates with
all free edges and used mode shapes and natural frequen-
cies as detectors to determine the material properties.
Hwang and Chang [3] utilized natural frequencies to
determine the elastic constants of orthotropic composite
plates and adopted impulse testing to verify results.
Shieh [4] applied the ﬁnite element software MSC NAS-
TRAN to do forward analysis and calculated the elastic
constants of orthotropic plates and shells through non-
linear optimization and neural networks. Liang and
Hwu [5] made use of static strains computed by bound-
ary element methods and identiﬁed the sizes and
locations of holes and cracks in a plate. Wang et al.

where Nm is the neuron number of the output layer, and e is
a vector of network errors.
Tominimize the error function (7), LM (Levenberg–Mar-
quardt) method [16,17] is used in this paper. This training
algorithm is designed to combine the advantage of quasi-
Newton [15] and steepest descent method [18]. Through
LM method, the neuron weights are updated by adding
DW ¼ ðJTJþ lIÞ1JTeðWÞ; ð8Þ
where J is the Jacobian matrix containing the ﬁrst deriva-
tives of the error function with respect to the weights, I is
the unit matrix andW is the weights of pervious iteration.
The parameter l is utilized to adjust the training algorithm
to quasi-Newton method or steepest descent method. At
the beginning of iteration, a large value of l is selected to
make the characteristic of training algorithm more close
to steepest descent method which can decrease the error
function more quickly. When the error function decreases
to a certain value, a small value of l is selected to make
the training more close to quasi-Newton method which
can converge fast. According to this understanding, in this
paper the value of l is adjusted by the following way:
E < E; l ¼ a1l; a1 ¼ 0:1;
E > E; l ¼ a2l; a2 ¼ 10;
ð9Þ
where the superscript ‘‘’’ represents the value in pervious
iteration.
As described in Section 2, the training patterns are pre-
pared by inputting several diﬀerent material properties and
calculating their associated natural frequencies and static
strains through ANSYS. In this paper, we consider a wing
model with NACA 2412 airfoil whose chordwise length
c = 0.1 m and spanwise length L = 0.4 m. The wing skin
is made up of graphite/epoxy ﬁber-reinforced composite
materials which are stacked in the sequence of [90/45/
45/0] for the upper skin and [0/45/45/ 90] for the
lower skin with ply thickness t = 0.156 mm (Fig. 1). The
density of skin and core are 1429 and 44.98 kg/m3,
respectively.
Observing the training patterns for the lay-up considered
in this study [19], we found that the natural frequencies are
not sensitive to the change ofmaterial properties ofwing skin
in ﬁber transverse direction such as ET, tLT and GLT. Thus,
only the Youngs modulus of wing skin in ﬁber direction
EL and shear modulus of wing core Gc are selected to be
the components of output vector q when employing natural
frequencies as detectors. Under this consideration, the input
and output vectors used in this training are

; ð10Þ
where xi, i = 1,2,3 represent the natural frequencies of the
ﬁrst three natural modes and the superscript  represents
the maximum value of that variable in the training pat-
terns. From the normalization of input and output vectors,
the range of input and output vectors is 0–1. In our training
patterns, the Youngs modulus EL is given in the range of
10–200 GPa and the range of shear modulus Gc is from
0.8 MPa to 1 GPa. The other material properties are given
by the following ﬁxed values: ET = 2 GPa, GLT = 1 GPa,
mLT = 0.3. If the composites are made by diﬀerent lay-up,
similar approach by observing the sensitivity to the change
of material properties can be applied to select the output
vector for the training patterns.
From the above discussion, we see that it is diﬃcult to
measure the material properties in ﬁber transverse direction
through natural frequencies. To make up for this deﬁ-
ciency, static strains at certain points under loading in
chordwise direction are considered to be the input values.
Thus, the input and output vectors for the second training
patterns are

EL, ET and GLT are, respectively, 10–50, 0.1–5 and 0.05–
3 GPa, while the other material properties are:
Gc = 50 MPa, mLT = 0.3.
When the training patterns with input and output vec-
tors stated in (10) or (11) are well prepared through the ﬁ-
nite element model, the artiﬁcial neural network can be
trained by using LM method described at the beginning
of this section. Since the architecture of artiﬁcial neural
network includes the transfer function, the number of hid-
den layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the
convergence criterion, their selection becomes important
for a well-trained network. In this paper, the output vector
is speciﬁed in the range from 0 to 1 and hence Log-Sigmoid
function f(x) = (1 + ex)1 is selected to be the transfer
function. As usual, two hidden layers with several diﬀerent
neuron numbers are tried in this study to ﬁnd the most suit-
able network. The convergence criterion is set to be
E < 106. The training is performed by the commercial
software Neural Network Toolbox built in MATLAB 6.5

those plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (b). Table 3 shows the testing
results of natural frequencies of ﬁrst ﬁve modes from two
specimens excited and measured from three diﬀerent loca-
tions. From these results, we see that the natural frequen-
cies of wing specimens excited and measured from
diﬀerent locations of impulse hammer and accelerometer
are close to each other. Taking the average values from dif-
ferent locations, the input vector—natural frequencies of
the ﬁrst three modes, (10)1, required in the artiﬁcial neural
network can then be provided to output the material prop-
erties, (10)2, on-line.
4.1.3. Static strain measurement
As stated in Section 3, to know the material properties
in ﬁber transverse direction a force in chordwise direction
is applied on the wing specimen and the static strains at
the points indicated in Fig. 2 are measured. To apply a
2 kgw force in the required direction, a vertical force due
to steelyard weights is applied and its loading direction is
changed through the arrangement of a cotton thread de-
toured by a metal stick (Fig. 4). The strains are then mea-
sured through a 45 strain rosette mounted on the location
shown in Fig. 2. Table 4 shows the testing results of static
strains at two diﬀerent locations from two specimens.
4.2. In-lab measurement
The in-lab specimens of graphite/epoxy ﬁber-reinforced
composites and foam are made and tested according to
ASTM standards [21]. By the tension tests on the unidirec-
tional [0]8, [90]8 and [45]8 specimens, the elastic proper-
ties EL, ET, tLT and GLT of graphite/epoxy ﬁber-reinforced
composites can be determined. To determine the shear
modulus of foam core Gc, we follow the instruction stated
in ASTM C273-61 [22,23]. Through these standard proce-
dures, the material properties of the specimens used in this
paper are measured and shown in Table 5.
4.3. Comparison between on-line and in-lab measurements
After getting the natural frequencies and static strains
shown in Tables 3 and 4 from on-line measurement, the
material properties can be calculated real-time through
the well-trained network discussed in Section 3. The
