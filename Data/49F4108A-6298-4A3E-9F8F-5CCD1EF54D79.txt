1. Introduction 42 
 43 
Metallic pollution and chemical contaminants such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic 44 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic to soil-dwelling organisms (Labrot et al., 1996; Brown et al., 45 
2004). These organisms include earthworms, which are common in a wide range of soils and 46 
may represent 60-80% of the total soil biomass. Ingesting a large of amount of soil allows 47 
earthworms to readily accumulate heavy metals (Lanno et al., 2004), which then are concentrated 48 
mainly in the chloragogenous tissue around the alimentary canal (Stürzenbaum et al., 2001). 49 
Despite the fact that earthworms may come into direct contact with heavy metals in the soil, they 50 
have demonstrated a strong tolerance for metallic pollution (Morgan and Morgan, 1998). Thus, 51 
earthworms have been reported to be bio-indicator organisms for metal-pollution assessment 52 
(Van Hook et al., 1974) as exemplified by Esenia fetida, one of the most common earthworm 53 
species that is also recommended by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 54 
(OECD) to be utilized in ecotoxicology tests. 55 
Earthworms with heavy metal exposure may experience physiological disturbances such as a 56 
reduction of biomass, population size and reproduction as well as lysosome deficiencies 57 
(Massicotte et al., 2003; Spurgeon et al., 2004; Ricketts et al., 2004). In addition, heavy metal 58 
sensitized earthworms ultimately alter their gene expression profiles as well. One of the most 59 
important heavy metal-inducible proteins in earthworms is metallothionein-2, which plays a role 60 
in scavenging free radicals in the cell (Fahim et al., 2006; Mosleh, 2007; Liang et al., 2009), 61 
regulating tissue-specific development (Chen et al., 2004), protecting DNA from UV damage 62 
(Fourie et al., 2007) and sequestering heavy metals. Metallothioneins are ubiquitous in 63 
eukaryotic organisms and constitute a superfamily of low molecular weight metalloproteins rich 64 
in cysteine (25%~30% of the total protein weight) but lacking aromatic or histidine residues 65 
(Kägi et al., 1987). High cysteine content and identified motifs, such as C-C, C-X-C and 66 
5 
 
were treated with Cd, the concentrations of Cd used in this study were not lethal for earthworms 91 
and the survival rate was more than 97%. Furthermore, the average weight in each earthworm 92 
before and after Cd treatment is approximately the same (p < 0.05) (data not shown). RNA was 93 
isolated from the posterior alimentary canal and surrounding tissue using the TRIzol-reagent 94 
(Invitrogen), and 1 μg RNA was used in a 13 μL reverse transcription reaction mixture 95 
containing 2.5 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP, Takara) and 1.5 μM of the primer 96 
MTB-w1 (Table 1), which was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and on ice for 1 min. Following the 97 
addition of 4 μL of 5× first-strand reverse transcription buffer, 1 μL of 0.1 M dithiothreitol 98 
(DTT), 1 μL (40 U) of RNase inhibitor and 1 μL (200 U) of Superscript III RT (Invitrogen), the 99 
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 55 °C for 60 min and 75 °C for 100 
15 min. One μL (60 U) of RNase H was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 20 101 
min. After completion of the first-strand cDNA synthesis, the partial cDNA fragment was 102 
amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the anchored primer MTB-w2 and 103 
degenerate primers designed from highly conserved amino acid motifs of the MT superfamily 104 
(Table 1). Primer combinations (2.5 μM of each of the forward and reverse primers) were used in 105 
25 μL of an amplification mixture containing 0.5 μL of ss-cDNA, 5 U of r-Taq DNA polymerase 106 
(Takara), 150 pmol of anchored primer, 50 pmol of degenerate primers and 4 pmol of dNTP. 107 
After an initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, the mixture was incubated at 94 °C for 30 s, 42 108 
°C for 1 min and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, followed by a final 5 min extension at 72 °C. The 109 
amplified cDNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with the 110 
control and induced cDNA preparations analyzed simultaneously. Bands differentially expressed 111 
in the induced condition were excised from the gel. The PCR product was extracted using a gel 112 
extraction kit (Qiagen) and was subsequently ligated to a pGEM-T vector (Promega) for DNA 113 
sequencing.  114 
7 
 
(pH 7.4). The cell suspension (10 μl) of coelomocytes obtained above was embedded with 75 μl 139 
of 0.5% (w/v) LMPA in PBS. The mixture was placed on the pre-coated slides along with the 140 
mixtures of 0.5% NMPA and 0.5% LMPA and immediately covered with a coverslip. The slides 141 
were maintained at 4◦C for 5 min before the coverslip was removed, and the cells were 142 
immersed in a freshly made lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris and 1% 143 
(v/v) Triton X-100 at pH 10) at 4◦C for 1 h. The slides were then placed in a horizontal 144 
electrophoresis apparatus containing 0.3 M NaOH and 1 mM Na2EDTA, and the electrophoresis 145 
(1 V/cm, 300 mA) was conducted at 4◦C for 15 min. After the electrophoresis, the slides were 146 
soaked in a cold-neutralizing buffer (400 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5) at 4◦C for 10 min. The slides 147 
were dried in 100% methanol for 5 min and stored in a low humidity environment until being 148 
stained with 40 μl PI (2.5 μg/ml). The quantification of the comet assay was performed with the 149 
professional software CometScoreTM Version 1.5.  150 
 151 
2.4. DNA protection assay 152 
A DNA protection assay was performed as previously described (Zhao et al., 2002) with 153 
some modifications. DNA protection from oxidative damage in vitro was assessed using 154 
pGEX-6p-3 plasmid DNA (4983 bp). To measure the effect of MT-2 on DNA damage, plasmid 155 
DNA (100 ng) was incubated with various amounts of purified MT-2 in 20 mM chelex-treated 156 
phosphate buffer, composed of Fe–NTA, to achieve a molar ratio of 1:1 of Fe(III) to NTA for 30 157 
min prior to the addition of 300 μM FeSO4, 2 mM H2O2 and 2 mM sodium ascorbate. The pH 158 
was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 N HCl and 1 N NaOH. Plasmid DNA was resolved by electrophoresis 159 
on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer, and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The loss of 160 
intensity of DNA bands served as a measure of DNA damage. 161

3. Results 191 
3.1. Measurement of earthworm metallothionein-2 in response to Cd with quantitative real-time 192 
PCR  193 
Although cadmium treatments have been shown to effectively induce metallothionein-2 in 194 
earthworm M. posthuma (references), the transcription levels of metallothionein-2 of this 195 
organism in response to different Cd concentrations and exposure times remain to be investigated. 196 
For this end, the induction of earthworm metallothionein-2 after exposure to cadmium, M. 197 
posthuma was cultivated in soils containing 20 ppm, 40 ppm or 80 ppm of CdCl2 for 1 d, 3 d, 7 d 198 
or 14 d and extracted earthworm RNA was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) 199 
analysis. The cDNA of β-actin gene of M. posthuma was cloned and sequenced since the β-actin 200 
was regarded as an invariant internal control as earthworms were exposed to metal-contaminated 201 
soil (Stu¨rzenbaum, S. R.; Kille, P. Control genes in quantitative molecular biological techniques: 202 
the variability of invariance. Comp. Biochem. Phys. B 2001, 130, 281-289). In consequence, the 203 
amplicon consists of a 3’–UTR region and a translation region, which was confirmed to be part 204 
of the β-actin gene (accession no. JF276399). Thereafter, a pair of primers Q-M.po-MT2F and 205 
Q-M.po-MT2R were designed on the basis of the resolved M. posthuma β-actin gene sequence 206 
and applied to normalize relative transcription levels of metallothionein-2 in which a single peak 207 
in the melting curve represents primer specificity (data not shown). As the data shown in Fig. 1, 208 
metallothionein-2 expression remarkably increased as earthworms were exposed to cadmium 209 
compared to the levels of metallothionein-2 of untreated worms. Moreover, more cadmium doses 210 
11 
 
contaminated with higher Cd concentration. The result indicates the effectiveness of Cd 235 
accumulation by earthworms was better in the less Cd contaminated soil than those of higher Cd 236 
concentrations. On the other hand, the atomic absorption technique was also applied to determine 237 
Cd removal from soil due to earthworm cultivation. Our data showed that the decreased amount 238 
of Cd depended on incubation times and Cd removal from soil was estimated equivalent to Cd 239 
the amount of accumulation by earthworms at each sampling day (Fig. 2B).      240 
 241 
3.3. Anti-oxidation of earthworm metallothionein-2  242 
As described, earthworm metallothionein-2 was induced by Cd (Fig. 1) and one of the 243 
biological functions of metallothionein-2 is to protect cells from oxidative injury (Atif et al., 244 
2006; Reinecke et al., 2006). To test whether Cd caused oxidative damage to earthworms, M. 245 
posthuma were treated with or without Cd and their coelmonocytes were extracted for a 246 
subsequent comet assay. The quantification of DNA tail movement was performed with the 247 
professional software CometScoreTM Version 1.5. As a consequence, DNA tail movement in a 248 
comet assay revealed significant DNA damage in M. posthuma coelmonocytes compared to 249 
those of untreated worms after being exposed to cadmium (Fig. 3). Our result demonstrated that 250 
cadmium exposure was able to elicit oxidative stress to damage the genomic DNA of earthworm 251 
coelmonocytes. 252 
To assess DNA protection provided by earthworm metallothionein-2, plasmid pGEX6P-3 253 
was incubated with or without the purified recombinant M. posthuma metallothionein-2 in the 254 
presence Fe-NTA, which catalyzed the generation of hydroxyl radicals as part of the Fenton 255 
reaction. The plasmid DNA was then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. A smeared DNA 256 
band indicated severe DNA damage in the absence of metallothionein-2. In the presence of 257 
metallothionein-2, however, the integrity of the DNA was largely maintained (Fig. 4). 258 
13 
 
phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed (Fig. 5). As a result, eleven metallothionein-2s 283 
constituted two major clusters including members of Megascolecidae and Lumbricidae 284 
consistent with conventional taxonomic classification. The result implied that metallothionein-2s 285 
have conservative characters in earthworm family. In addition to realization of phylogenetic 286 
relationships among various species, earthworm metallothionein-2s are regarded as biomarkers 287 
in response to heavy metal pollutions.  288 
 289 
4. Discussion 290 
A number of studies have revealed a clear role of metallothionein-2 for detoxification by 291 
direct sequestration of heavy metals in eukaryotic organisms including earthworms (references). 292 
The comet assay showed that oxidative stress elicited by cadmium exposure inevitably caused 293 
DNA damage in M. posthuma (Fig. 3), and similar effects were also reported in the coelmocytes 294 
of other earthworm species such as Amynthas diffringens, Aporrectodea caliginosa, 295 
Dendrodrilus rubidus, E. fetida and Microchaetus benhami (Li et al., 2009; Fourie et al., 2007). 296 
Although oxidative stress itself is negatively correlated with increased metallothionein-2 297 
expression (Leonard et al., 2004; Min, 2007), our results demonstrated that the increased apo- 298 
recombinant metallothionein-2 was capable of conferring better protection for DNA against 299 
oxidative stress by diminishing the breakdown of DNA in vitro (Fig. 4) in agreement with the 300 
previous study that showed overexpression of metallothioneien partially reduced reactive oxygen 301 
and nitrogen species and markedly attenuated intracellular oxidation (Lazo et al., 1998). Thus, 302 
increased metallothionein-2 expression in earthworms may play important roles not only in 303 
direct sequestration of metals but also in elimination of metal-mediated oxidative damage. 304 
It has been reported that cadmium exposure at 100 ppm resulted in a 12.6-fold and 13.9-fold 305 
up-regulation of metallothionein-2 for E. fetida and L. rubellus, respectively (Brulle et al., 2006; 306 
15 
 
different earthworm species (reference) greatly corresponds to variation of bio-accumulation of 331 
metals (References). Thirdly, as the result shown in Fig. 1, the Cd-exposed dose and time 332 
affecting metallothionein-2 induction even in the same earthworm species must be taken into 333 
consideration (Morgan and Morgan, 1999; Dai et al., 2004 change). Notably, earthworms 334 
accumulated more Cd as they were exposed to higher dose of Cd than lower dose of Cd at a 335 
constant exposure time; however, earthworms in higher Cd concentration have a lower Cd 336 
accumulation efficiency according to the value of the BCF (Fig. 2A, 2B). The reciprocal effect 337 
indicated that earthworms exposed to the soil with low Cd contamination are expected to exert a 338 
more effective Cd removal efficacy. 339 
Since earthworm metallothionein-2 significantly responded to Cd, metallothionein-2 340 
sequence information is advantageous in helping to clarify the potential role as biomarkers by the 341 
real-time PCR technique for monitoring heavy metal pollution in soil (Dallinger et al., 1997; 342 
Geffard et al., 2002; Galay-Burgos et al., 2003). More resolved earthworm metallothionein-2 343 
sequences are required for this end, and thus a broad spectrum of metallothionein-2 genes were 344 
cloned and sequenced from six megascolecid earthworms (M. posthuma, P. elongata, A. 345 
aspergillus, M. californica, M. formosae and M. paiwanna) and a glossoscolecid earthworm (P. 346 
corethrurus). Acquiring the nucleotide sequences of metallothionein-2 in the above earthworms 347 
were used to compare them with lumbricid earthworms such as E. fetida, L. rubellus, L. terrestris 348 
and L. castaneus. The phylogenetic tree analysis allowed us to understand evolutionary 349 
divergence and the possibility of applicable roles of bio-marker and bio-remediation in more 350 
places because these species are geographically restricted in Europe and are widely distributed 351 
across Taiwan and other Asian countries, which stands in contrast to the previously studied 352 
lumbricid earthworms.  353 
In this study, metallothionein-2 expression of earthworm M. posthuma due to cadmium 354
