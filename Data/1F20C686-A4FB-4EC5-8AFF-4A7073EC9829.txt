Solventogenesis 是 Clostridium屬細菌將累積的有機酸轉化的一種 detoxic
機制。利用有機酸轉化為醇類(主要為丁醇)的生物技術提供了一創新的方式，減
低了因有機酸累積所造成的負荷。本計畫的目的乃評估將氫發酵產生的有機酸
(主要為丁酸)轉換成丁醇的潛力。本研究利用不同的蔗糖濃度(0, 10, 50, 90 g/L)
用來探討以環境微生物(Clostridium屬)產丁醇的生成動力學。研究中發現氫/
有機酸的暗發酵反應在 pH 4 仍可發生，但是在 pH 低於 3時則停止。研究結果指
出在 90 g/L 的蔗糖濃度時，產生最高的丁酸濃度，將近 11,000 mg/L。相對於
乙酸，丁酸在暗發酵過程中為主要生成物種。就醇類的生成而言，丁醇濃度在蔗
糖 90 g/L 濃度下，以階梯的模式隨時間而增加，它說明了對於有機酸的 detoxic
機制已漸漸發生。然而，丁酸轉化為丁醇的結果卻不是十分明顯，主要原因在於
丁酸的濃度過高而看不出轉化的效果。另外，在此四種基質濃度下乙醇的生成均
可被發現，然相對於丁醇濃度，乙醇濃度均高於丁醇濃度，但乙醇濃度並不會隨
著時間而增加，最大的乙醇濃度 600 mg/L 也出現在蔗糖 90 g/L 濃度下。

41. Introduction
There has been a renewed research interest on biological hydrogen production lately.
This was mainly attributed to growing global environmental concerns and energy
insecurity. As a sustainable and clean energy source with minimal or zero use of
hydrocarbons, hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuel. Promising results
on biological hydrogen production were obtained using different substrates. In early
studies, researchers have explored the hydrogen production potential of simple
synthetic substrates in batch experiments (Van Ginkel et al., 2001; Khanal et al., 2004)
and in continuous operation (Lin and Chang, 1999; Duangmanee et al., 2002; Khanal
et al., 2006). The potential of hydrogen production from complex substrates, e.g.,
municipal solid wastes (Ueno et al., 1995), cellulose containing wastes (Okamoto et
al., 2000), starch-manufacturing wastewater (Yokoi et al., 2002), and activated sludge
(Wang et al., 2003) was reported by several investigators. However, the yield of
hydrogen is still low due to the theoretical limitation. In addition, the production of
significant amounts of organic acids, particularly butyrate, was accompanied with the
production of hydrogen. These organic acids could burden to the environment if
without any proper pretreatments. Alternatively, converting organic acids to solvents
(butanol), which Clostridium used to biocatalyze hydrogen and acids productions
could shift the metabolism to solvents productions, provides an innovative solution.
The bioprocess not only reduces the organic acids loading to the environment but also
generates a renewable bioenergy.
To date, most studies conducting on biobutanol production are restricted in the
conversion of crop-derived sugars or organic acids by pure microbial culture.
Hartmanis et al. (1984) investigated the pathway of uptake of butyrate by Clostridium
acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Apart from butyrate, a study found butanol production
by Clostridium beijerinckii BA101 would increase by the addition of acetate (Chen
and Blaschek, 1999). Formanek et al. (1997) obtained butanol production from
glucose in batch and continuous operations by using Clostridium beijerinckii BA101
as an inoculum.
The overall goal of the proposed project was to develop an anaerobic fermentation
process that converts organic acids generated from hydrogen fermentation to butanol.
The butanol production by fermentative bacteria has significant potential to enhance
the economic viability of many processes that utilize butanol either as a fuel source or
as a raw material for industries. The specific objective of this study was to
investigate the kinetics of butanol production from mixed microbial cultures. The
effect of substrate concentrations on butanol concentration was evaluated.

Figure 1. Cumulative hydrogen production with time
The variations of pH with time at different sucrose concentrations are illustrated in
Figure 2. As revealed in the figure, the pH dropped with time at all sucrose
concentrations, except 0 g/L. The drop of pH was mainly due to the production of
acids. In our previous study, we found that hydrogen fermentation ceased at pH
below 4. However, based on the results in Figure 1, hydrogen fermentation from day
3to day 4 still could be performed at pH between 3 and 4 for sucrose concentrations of
50 and 90 g/L.

Figure 2. pH variation with time
Figure 3 shows butyrate concentration with time at different sucrose concentrations.
As revealed in Figure 3, butyrate concentrations for the four sucrose concentrations all
remained consistently since day 4. The highest butyrate concentration of nearly
11,000 mg/L was appeared at sucrose concentrations of 90 g/L. Based on this 10-d
experimental period, it was not observed the further uptake of butyrate concentration.
The result also explained why the pH (Figure 2) in the end of the experimental period
8Figure 5 indicates butanol concentration versus time at different sucrose
concentrations. As revealed in the figure, no butanol was found at 10 g sucrose/L,
but the productions of butanol were observed at 50 and 90 g sucrose /L, respectively.
The results concluded that higher butanol concentration was found at higher sucrose
concentration. For 50 g sucrose /L, butanol concentration increase with time, and it
seemed to achieve the maximum at 36 mg/L since day 6. For 90 g sucrose /L, the
maximum butanol concentration was appeared at nearly 94 mg/L in 10-d experimental
period. However, as evident from the figure, the variation of butanol concentration
was followed the pattern of climbing steps. Butanol concentration thereby could be
possibly increased if the experimental period could be prolonged.

Figure 5. Butanol concentration versus time at different sucrose concentrations
In addition to butanol production, ethanol production was found in the study. Figure
6 illustrates the variation of ethanol concentration with time at different sucrose
concentrations. As evident from the figure, the maximum ethanol concentration of
600 mg/L was appeared at sucrose of 90 g/L. However, mostly ethanol
concentration was remained in between 350 and 470 mg/L. The similar trend has
been followed by sucrose concentrations of 10 and 50 g/L. There was no significant
difference on ethanol concentration between the two sucrose concentrations. In
contrast to butanol concentration, ethanol concentration was not increased with time
albeit ethanol concentrations were higher than butanol concentrations.
