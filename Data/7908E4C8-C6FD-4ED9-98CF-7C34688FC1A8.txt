English Abstract
With/without considering the detachment mechanism, the deposition 
morphology of Brownian/non-Brownian particles within a constricted tube is 
investigated by applying the Brownian dynamics simulation method in the present 
paper. Two different geometric structures, the parabolic constricted tube (PCT) and 
the sinusoidal constricted tube (SCT), are adopted. The effects of various types of the 
total interaction energy curves of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)
theory and increasing flow velocity on the particle deposition morphology are also 
examined. For PCT without considering the detachment mechanism, under the same 
interaction energy curve, it is found that the number of non-Brownian particles 
deposited is higher than that of the Brownian particles. Since the deposition location 
moves closer to the constriction part of the tube, the number of 
4simulation results obtained by Beizaie et al. [2] and Ramarao et al. [4] indicate that 
the deposition process consists of two consequence stages: the stage of decreasing 
porosity and the stage of blocking. In the first stage, the particle deposition occurs 
mainly through the individual adhesion, and a relatively smooth deposit layer will be 
formed on the grain surfaces. The major effect of deposition at this stage is to increase 
the effective grain dimension (or reduce the effective radius of the constricted tube 
shown below). The second stage of deposition is dominated by the blockage of the 
pore; particle deposition at this stage only resulting in the pore blockage, not in an 
increased grain diameter. Moreover, the lengths of these two stages were found to be 
dependent on the relative particle to collector size, the flow field around the collector 
and the relative magnitudes between the van der Waals attractive forces and the 
electrostatic repulsion forces of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)
theory [7].
In our previous papers [8], with the consideration of the particle attachment 
mechanism only, we had investigated the deposition morphologies and the 
corresponded collection efficiencies of hydrosols onto a spherical collector. By using 
the same Brownian dynamics simulation method developed by Ramarao et al. [4] and 
including the shadow area effect cast by those deposited particles, the effect of 
various types of the total interaction energy curves of DLVO theory on the particles' 
collection efficiencies were examined in that paper. Comparing with the case without 
considering the Brownian diffusion force in the trajectory equation, our simulation 
results showed that the collection efficiency is always higher when the particle's 
Brownian motion behavior is taken into consideration. However, the detachment 
mechanism of particles was not considered in that paper.
Particle detachment resulting from fluid flowing through granular media has 
significant importance in many engineering fields such as filters. In the filtration 
6tube (SCT), will be adopted. In these simulations, the effects of two different shapes 
of the total interaction energy curves of DLVO theory and increasing flow velocity are 
also considered. Distinguished deposition morphology is found between those 
particles with and without considering the particle’s detachment mechanism.
2. The constricted tube model
Different from other models, for example, the capillary tube model [17, 18], the 
single sphere model [19, 20, 21] and the sphere-in-cell model [22], the constricted 
tube model is the only model takes the joint effect of neighboring grains and the 
blockage phenomenon caused by those deposited particles into consideration. The 
details of mathematic formulations describe this constricted tube model were provided 
in the excellent dissertation of Prof. Payatakes [23] and in the good review paper of 
Tien and Payatakes [24]. As shown in Fig. 1, the dimension of the constricted tube (i.e. 
PCT) is characterized by three quantities: the height, h, the maximum diameter, dmax,
and the constriction diameter, d c . The radius rc and rmax are dc/2 and dmax/2, 
respectively. Expressions for the determination of these quantities are summarized in 
Table 1. For a spherical collector with diameter d f , the relationship between rc, rmax
and df are defined as (see chapter 3 in ref. [3]):

With the consideration of 200 particles originated from this inlet control window and 
the specification of the flow fluid within the tube, the particle deposition morphology
can be determined by integrating the Langevin type trajectory equation below.
4. The Langevin type trajectory equation
In the present paper, if the gravity force is ignored, the Langevin type trajectory 
equation describing the force balance on a Brownian particle with a diameter pd can
be written as [5, 6]:
p
p d e r d Lo DL r
dv
m F F F F F F F
dt
 / /  / / / (6)
where pm is the mass of the particle, pv is the particle velocity vector and t is the 
time. The forces considered in the present paper are the drag force dF , the DLVO 
interaction force eF , which is sum of the London van der Waals attractive force LoF
and the electric double layer repulsive force DLF [7], and the random force rF . The 
trajectory of a Brownian particle described by the above Langevin type equation can 
be obtained incrementally. Over a sufficiently short time interval, tt 3110 , the 
fluid velocities of ru and zu can be regarded as constant. Note that the value of the 
time step ̴t adopted in the present paper remains as small as 10-6 sec, which is the 
same order of the momentum relaxation time (~ 1/͊) of the particle [5].
By substituting the expressions of those forces shown in Eq. (6), then the particle 
velocities in the normal and tangential directions can be represented, respectively, as

Once the initial position of the ith particle pir originated in the control window is 
known, its trajectory can be determined based on the above trajectory equations. 
When the separation distance between the particle and the collector surface (or the 
previous deposited particle) is smaller than the radius of this ith particle, then we 
assume that this ith particle is deposited in the present paper.

proceeds, it becomes unrealistic when both the increased surface area provided by 
those deposited particles and the flow velocity changed effect are not considered. In 
the present paper, we will adopt the equation of the effective radius to solve this tube 
radius reduced problem in the first stage of deposition described above as follows.
If a layer of deposit is formed over the tube wall surfaces, the effective radius of 
the constricted tube can be assume to be as [11]

where R is the local radius of the tube, dR is the value of R at the inlet of the 
tube, n is a constant, z is the tube axial distance measured from the inlet, l is the 
length of the tube, d( is the deposit porosity and pN is the number of particles 
deposited. The choice of n is somewhat arbitrary; it can be chosen to give the best 
fit with experimental data, and is dependent on the ratio of particle diameter to grain
diameter, RN . With small RN , the distribution of particle deposit tends to be more 
uniform leading to a larger value of n . On the contrary, with large RN , particles will
be deposited mostly near the tube inlet leading to a more nonuniform deposition and a 
smaller value of n . Choo and Tien [11] found that n = 0.15 when cv = 0.7 cm/sec 
and d( = 0.8, and n = 0.5 when cv = 0.4 cm/sec and d( = 0.8 can fit best to their 
experimental data. In the present paper, we will adopt the values of n = 0.5 when 
cv = 0.4 cm/sec and d( = 0.8 to simulate the deposited morphology of particles when 
the detachment mechanism is considered.
The detachment mechanism requires a large tangential drag force acting on the 
depositing particle if the local fluid velocity in the tube is excessively large. Since the

For 
inU =0.2 cm/sec, the simulation results of the deposition morphology of 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles within PCT for the interaction energy curves A and 
% shown in Fig. 2 are illustrated in Fig. 3. Regardless whether the Brownian motion 
behavior of particles is considered or not, since there is no energy barrier existed in 
case B, hence the number of particles collected for curve B is always greater than that 
of curve A. More importantly, because of their increased ability to overcome the 
height of the energy barrier of curve A shown in Fig. 2, hence those Brownian 
particles are easier to deposit at the entrance region of the tube than the non-Brownian 
particles. On the contrary, since those particles without considering the Brownian 
motion behavior own smaller ability to overcome the energy barrier, and therefore are 
able to deposit at the region close to the center narrow part of the tube as shown in Fig. 
1, so the number of particles deposited for non-Brownian particles are larger than 
those of the Brownian particles as shown in Fig. 3. Note that, for those non-Brownian 
particles, since they are easier to deposit at the center part of the tube, so they own 
greater opportunity to intercept those upcoming particles to form the multi-layer 
dendrites, and therefore the second blockage stage for those non-Brownian particles is 
easier to achieve at the constricted part than that at the entrance region of the tube.
When the flow velocity is decreased from 
inU =0.2 cm/sec to inU =0.1 
cm/sec, the simulation results of the deposition morphology of 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles within PCT are shown in Fig. 4. Similar to those 
observed in Fig. 3, the order of the magnitude is curve B > curve A. Since those 
non-Brownian particles are easier to deposit at the constricted part of the tube, 
therefore the number of particles deposited for non-Brownian particles is always 
greater than those of the Brownian particles. Accompanying with the smaller inertia 
forces for

collection situation to deposit at the constriction part of SCT than that of PCT, at 
which the streamlines at the entrance are parallel to the axis, but change their 
direction very quickly as they move into the cell center [29]. In the simulations of 
using SCT, in addition to those factors of the flow rate and the DLVO interaction 
energy curves, we found that the steep slope of the tube wall near the constriction part 
of the tube dominates the whole deposition process of Brownian/non-Brownian 
particles. By this fact, as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6, the joint of individual dendrites 
and therefore the second blockage stage becomes more pronounced in SCT.
6.2. The detachment mechanism is considered
In the above simulations, since the detachment mechanism of particles is not 
considered when the tangential drag force acting on the depositing particle is large 
enough, so those deposition morphologies of non-Brownian/Brownian particles 
illustrate in Figs. 3-6 become unrealistic. In the following simulations, the changed 
flow field corresponding to the Nth particle deposition is obtained from the effective 
radius equation obtained by using Eq. (15), and the detachment criteria of the (N+1)th 
particle is attained when its local tangential velocity is greater than the critical 
detachment velocity 0.4 cm/sec described above.
Fig. 7 shows the deposition morphology of non-Brownian/Brownian particles in 
PCT corresponding to curves A and B shown in Fig. 2 when inU =0.2 cm/sec. Same 
as those observed in Fig. 3 that the number of particles deposited for the “barrierless”
type curve B is higher than that of curve A where a large primary maximum and a 
deep secondary minimum existed. However, since the detachment mechanism is 
considered, there are only 3 or 4 layers can be formed in the multi-layer dendrites as 
shown in Figs. 7(a)-(d), and the number of non-Brownian particles deposited is almost 
the same as that of Brownian particles for the same interaction energy curve. Note that 
those Brownian particles still can form the multi-layer dendrites more close to the 
18
both PCT and SCT, it can be found that particle deposition over the tube wall surfaces 
is hardly to occur at the second half of the tube.
7. Conclusion
By applying the Brownian dynamics simulation method, the deposition 
morphologies of non-Borwnian/Brownian particles within the constricted tube of two 
different geometric structures, PCT and SCT, for various types of the DLVO 
interaction energy curves have been studied. When the detachment mechanism is not 
considered, because of their ability to move closer to the constriction part of the tube, 
the number of non-Brownian particles deposited is always greater than those of 
Brownian particles. For PCT, the number of Brownian/non-Brownian particles 
increase significantly when the flow velocity is decreased from inU =0.2 cm/sec to 
inU =0.1 cm/sec. Because of the steep slope of the tube wall near the constriction part 
of the tube dominates the whole deposition process, the number of 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles deposited for SCT is greater than that of PCT.
Same variation tendency is observed for those non-Brownian/Brownian particles 
within the PCT/SCT when the detachment mechanism is considered. Because of the 
attainment of the detachment criteria, not like the case without considering the 
detachment mechanism at which the joint of individual dendrites at the second
blockage stage is obtained, there are only four and five layers can be formed in the 
multi-later dendrites in PCT and SCT, respectively, in the present study.

Fig. 1. The schematic diagram for simulating the deposition of aerosol particles in a
parabolic type constricted tube model (PCT).
From the trajectory of a given aerosol particle, one can then determine whether
this particle will deposit on the tube wall or not. With these simulation steps, the
initial collection efficiency of Brownian aerosols for a single collector can be obtained
as:

Table 1. In order to take the particle’s Brownian deposition mechanism into 
consideration, the parameter values for the case of submicron aerosols with low
velocities are especially adopted; for example, when su 0.5 sec/cm , p = 1.0
3/ cmg , gd =525 m and pd =0.1 m , the values of stN and PeN are as low as
1.70E-06 and 3.80E+3, respectively.

By applying the multiple nonlinear regression program of SPSS [2], a new
correlation equation predicting the initial collection efficiency 0 can be obtained as

After the detailed calculations, the averaged variances provided by Eq. (6) and the
new modified correlation Eqs. (5) and (7) for the experimental data of Jung et al. [3],
Knettig and Beeckmans [4], Doganoglu [5], Melcher et al. [6] are summarized in
Table 3. For the experimental data obtained by Knettig and Beeckmans [4],
Doganoglu [5], Melcher et al. [6], it can be found that the ability of using Eq. (7) on
predicting 0 , even worse than Eq. (5), but still is as good as that of Eq. (6) in
general. For the experimental data obtained by Jung et al. [3], the accuracy of the new
modified correlation Eq. (7) on predicting 0 is the best among Eqs. (5), (6) and (7).
