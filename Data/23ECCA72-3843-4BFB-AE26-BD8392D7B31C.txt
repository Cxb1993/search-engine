公共自行車不只是一種交通工具，更是帶動使用的吸引力，歐洲將近四分之一的使用
者騎乘公共自行車的目的為觀光遊憩，遊憩旅次高達 20~25%，顯示公共自行車對於遊客的
吸引力。騎乘公共自行車成為受歡迎的旅遊活動，亦成為城市行銷的最佳代言。透過發展
「智慧型公共自行車取供系統」，可帶動各大專院校推動公共自行車之設置，以達節能減
碳、綠色校園，減少汽機車使用之效益。我們在中華大學建置「智慧型公共自行車取供系

(RSU)，同時相對地提高了建置成本，但對於我們設計方法的最大好處是避免了建置 RSU
成本。此外，我們的方法最特別的地方是利用了 Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments 
/Dedicated Short Range Communications (WAVE/DSRC)去增強車輛間在高速移動中的通訊能
力。 
我們的目標是設計一個無需基礎建設的車載監控和追蹤系統之應用，傳統的車載監控
與追蹤系統，需要仰賴路旁攝影機來取得影像記錄，但這樣的缺點，須要大量的影像記錄
與人力上的投入，將提高人力與物力的成本。因此，在我們的計畫中，我們會使用車載上
所裝載的開發板，整合 WAVE/DSRC Radio、GPS 接收器、Camera 模組、微處理器等硬體
裝置。微處理器主要是負責請求命令和協調各模組，WAVE/DSRC 裝置可以用來識別一些
目標車載(如:警政單位所認定的可疑的車輛)和提供車載間的通訊。 
僅有當車載停在路口，我們的裝置將驅動攝影機去拍攝前方的車牌，並進行車牌辨識，
因此，它可以避免移動間拍攝的圖片品質，可以有效地增強車牌辨識能力。所以，當經過
影像處理和可疑車牌樣本比對後，若是所認定的可疑車輛，我們將驅動 WAVE/DSRC 裝置
去產生一個查詢訊息，經由車間通訊(V2V Communication)找出最近的警車或是負責的車
輛。 
此外，在第二年度的計畫執行中，我們將藉由車間通訊技術設計出一個無需搭配基
礎建設的車載網路追蹤機制，其中包含路口偵測(Intersection Detection)、決定重廣播設計
(Rebroadcast Decision Scheme)、路口導引搜尋設計(Intersection-Guiding Search Scheme)和
記憶式 backoff 設計(Memory-Based Backoff Scheme)。在這些機制的運作下，可以充分地
減少網路上控制封包的負荷量和不必要的重廣播封包量。 
在自行車租借系統研究方面，我們著重於公共自行車技術整合以發展智慧型自行車取

Abstract—The Vehicular Surveillance and Sensing System (VS3)
is a 3G-based mobile device for car security applications. On
the car side, it consists of a CO2 sensor, a camera module, a
3G module, and a microprocessor. On the user side, only a 3G
mobile phone is needed. VS3 provides the following features:
(i) it can be triggered by events detected on car, (ii) events
can be abnormal air quality or potential burglary, and (iii) it
supports text or multimedia interaction with users. Application
scenarios include detecting an abnormal CO2 level or potential
car burglary, which triggers VS3 to transmit SMS, MMS, or
interactive video call to the vehicle owner, who can then monitor
the car situation in return. VS3 thus demonstrates a new car
security and burglarproof prototype.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid progress of embedded micro-sensing MEMS
and wireless communication technologies has made vehicular
sensor networks (VSNs) possible. A VSN normally consists of
a number of sensors placed on a vehicle to collect environment
data and utilizes these sensed data for various purposes. Ex-
amples include vehicle tracking, crash prevention, and mobile
surveillance [2], [3], [7].
In this work, we are interested in taking advantage of the
current 3G or 3.5G mobile systems to enrich user interaction
in a VSN. Our goal is to develop a surveillance and sensing
system for car security applications. Traditional surveillance
systems for vehicle protection rely on roadside cameras for
video recording. There are two problems associated with such
solutions. First, it requires huge efforts to distinguish targets
from many other candidates. Second, since targets are not
predefined, the recorded images are usually not clear enough.
Further, the volume of videos could be huge, thus requiring a
lot of labors.
We propose a 3G-enhanced VSN called vehicular surveil-
lance and sensing system (VS3). Only a 3G mobile phone
is needed on the user side, whereas an integrated device
with a CO2 sensor, a camera module, a 3G module, and a
Y.-C. Tseng’s research is co-sponsored by MoE ATU Plan, by NSC grants
96-2218-E-009-004, 97-3114-E-009-001, 97-2221-E-009-142-MY3, and 98-
2219-E-009-005, by MOEA 98-EC-17-A-02-S2-0048 and 98-EC-17-A-19-
S2-0052, and by ITRI, Taiwan.

microprocessor is need on the car side. The microprocessor
is responsible for issuing commands and coordinating with
other modules. VS3 provides the following features: (i) it
can be triggered by events detected on car, (ii) events can
be abnormal air quality or potential burglary, and (iii) it
supports text or multimedia interaction with users. Only when
an event is dectected, the camera module is activated to
capture images or record videos of that event. Thus, VS3 can
avoid recording unnecessary videos when nothing happens and
improving image/video quality. Application scenarios include
detecting an abnormal CO2 level or potential car burglary,
which triggers VS3 to transmit SMS (short message service),
MMS (multimedia message service), or interactive video call
to the vehicle owner, who can then monitor the car situation
in return. VS3 thus demonstrates a new car security and
burglarproof prototype.
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Fig. 1 shows the VS3 architecture. On the car side, it
consists of a CO2 sensor, a camera module, a 3G module,
and a microprocessor. On the user side, only a 3G mobile
phone is needed. To illustrate how VS3 works, we demonstrate
a car security and a car burglarproof applications below. In978-1-4244-5113-5/09/$25.00 c©2009 IEEE

Fig. 8. Wavecom Q2403A module.
III. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Fig. 5 shows the building blocks of the car unit. The
microprocessor in the car unit is an ARM9 board (Mini2440
[4]) with a 3.5” TFT LCD as shown in Fig. 6, which has
a 400MHz 32-bit RISC integer processor (ARM920T [1]),
64MB SDRAM, 64MB Nand Flash, 2MB Nor Flash with
BIOS, three serial ports, and a 10/100M Ethernet RJ-45. In
particular, Mini2440 can run embedded Linux and WinCE to
develop diverse applications.
The CO2 module has an H-550EV CO2 sensor [5] integrated
with Jennic JN5139 [6], which is mounted to Mini2440 via
an UART interface. Our prototype is shown in Fig. 7. The
CO2 sensor module has 0∼5,000ppm measurement range and
±30ppm accuracy. JN5139 has a 16MIPs 32-bit RISC proces-
sor, a 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceiver, 192kB of
ROM, and 96kB of RAM. In particular, JN5139 allows the
flexibility of supporting mesh networking and packet routing
inside a vehicle.
The 3G module is currently implemented by a Wavecom
Q2403A GSM/GPRS/CDMA module as shown in Fig. 8,
which is controlled by Mini2440 via AT commands. It per-
Fig. 9. CAM130 camera module.
forms SMS, MMS, and video calls as instructed by the ARM9
board.
The camera module is implemented by CAM130 as shown
in Fig. 9. It is a CMOS optical sensor. Mini2440 can send
a snapshot (record) command to CAM130. In return, a full-
resolution, single-frame still picture (video) will be transferred
to Mini2440 through the serial port.
In the CO2 monitoring application, the concentration thresh-
old is set to 1500ppm. We use AT commands to trigger the
3G module to send short messages. The car owner can return
a short message with a specific command to ask the ARM9
board to initiate a video call back.
In the burglarproof application, besides a warning short
message, a video clip is sent to the car owner as a multimedia
message. The clip can be provided to polices as evidence in
the future when needed.
IV. CONCLUSION
VS3 integrates 3G communication and CO2 sensing into
surveillance technologies to support intelligent car security
applications. The vehicle owner can be informed immediately
as unusual events are detected on car. At the same time, the
owner can remotely monitor the situation inside vehicle and
then take proper actions if necessary. VS3 can prevent vehicles
form burglar or keep evidences to catch the thief. Furthermore,
The baby or animal forgetfully left in the vehicle can be
rescued in time by the assistance of VS3. The future extension
of VS3 could be equipped more various sensors and form a
VS3 network to investigate cooperation issues and develop
novel applications.

Abstract— Micro-climate monitoring usually requires deploy-
ing a large number of measurement tools. By adopting vehicular
wireless sensor networks (VSNs), we can use fewer tools to
achieve fine-grained monitoring. This work proposes a VSN
architecture to realize micro-climate monitoring based on GSM
short messages and availability of GPS receivers on vehicles.
We demonstrate our prototype of a ZigBee-based car network
to monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in
areas of interest. The reported data are sent to a server, which is
integrated with Google Maps as our user interface. Since mobility
of these vehicles is not controllable and sending short messages
incurs charges, we also design an on-demand approach to adjust
vehicles’ reporting rates to balance between the micro-climate
accuracy and the communication cost.
I. INTRODUCTION
We are interested in monitoring micro-climate, which means
fine-grained environmental data in the scale of tens to hundreds
of square meters. Typically, climate means macro-climate,
which means data in the scale of tens to hundreds of square
kilometers. Monitoring micro-climate requires a large number
of measurement tools. By adopting vehicles (e.g., taxis and
buses) as carriers with sensing devices and wireless commu-
nication interfaces, we can use fewer measurement tools to
achieve fine-grained monitoring. We refer to such systems as
vehicular wireless sensor networks (VSNs).
This paper proposes a VSN architecture to monitor micro-
climate based on GSM short messages and geographic infor-
mation of vehicles. We show our prototype to monitor the
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in areas of interest.
CO2 gas is a critical index of air quality and global warming.
In our prototype, a vehicle is equipped with a CO2 sensor,
a GPS receiver, and a GSM module, which form a ZigBee-
based intra-vehicle wireless network. Each of such vehicles
thus serves as a vehicular sensor. These vehicular sensors
roam inside the area of interest and periodically report their
sensed data through GSM short messages. The reported data
is collected by a server, which is integrated with Google Maps
[1] to demonstrate the result.
Since the mobility of these vehicles is not controllable and
sending short messages incurs charges, how to adjust vehicles’
reporting rates to balance between the monitoring accuracy
and the communication cost is a challenge issue. We propose
an adaptive approach to dynamically change the reporting rates
of vehicular sensors on their readings. In particular, the data
variation in a grid is considered to adjust the reporting rate.
The major contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new architecture based on VSNs to support fine-
grained micro-climate monitoring by using a small number
of measurement tools. A prototype is also implemented to
verify the practicability of the proposed architecture. Second,
based on the proposed architecture, we also design an adaptive
approach to adjust the reporting rates of vehicles to balance
monitoring quality and communication cost.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
surveys some related work. Section III presents the proposed
VSN architecture. Our prototyping experiences are given in
Section IV. Section V concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Wireless sensor networks have been widely applied to
surveillance or monitoring scenarios [2][3][4]. However, they
do not discuss how to exploit mobility to reduce monitoring
cost. Mobile sensor deployment and dispatch have been in-
tensively studied in [5]. BikeNet [6] deploys multiple types
of sensors on bicycles to analyze various road information for
sharing of cyclists’ experience. MobEyes [7] adopts cameras
and chemical sensors to monitor pollution on streets, and
vehicles may exchange their sensing data when they meet
with each other. Compared to these work, our work is unique
in trying to reach a balance between message overheads and
sensing quality, under dynamically changing environments.
III. THE PROPOSED VSN ARCHITECTURE
Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed VSN architecture for micro-
climate monitoring. It contains a monitoring server, several
vehicular sensors, and GSM networks. Each vehicular sensor
is equipped with a CO2 sensor, a GSM module, and a GPS
receiver and periodically reports its sensed CO2 concentration
and its current location to the server through GSM short mes-
sages. The monitoring server then calculates the distribution
of CO2 concentration and renders the result on Google Maps.
According to the observed distribution and the vehicle density,
the server will ask sensors to adjust their reporting rates. For
each vehicular sensor, the intra-vehicle network is a ZigBee
network.

IV. PROTOTYPING EXPERIENCES
We have implemented a 16-vehicle prototype to collect
CO2 concentration in Hsin-Chu Science Park, Taiwan. Each
vehicle is equipped with the following hardware components
(as shown in Fig. 3):
1) Jennic board: It is a microprocess with a wireless
module. A Jennic board contains a JN5139 chip [8],
which has a 32-bit RISC processor, a fully compliant
2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 [9] transceiver, 192 KB of ROM,
and 96 KB of RAM. We use the ZigBee protocol [10]
for inter-board communication.
2) GPS receiver: We adopt the uPatch300 GPS module
[11]. It can provide geographic location with accuracy
≤ 1.8 meters. Its reporting rate is set to 1 second.
3) CO2 sensor: We adopt the H-550EV CO2 sensor module
[12]. It will sample CO2 concentration every 3 seconds.
Its detectable range is from 0 to 5,000 ppm with error
range of ±30 ppm.
4) GSM module: We adopt the SIM300 GSM module [13],
which supports the tri-band GSM/GPRS communica-
tion on frequency bands of 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, and
1,900 MHz.
Fig. 3 shows the snapshots of these components. The CO2
sensor is installed outside the vehicle, while the GPS receiver
and the GSM module are installed inside the vehicle. Each of
the GPS receiver and the CO2 sensor is attached to a Jennic
board, so they can communicate with each other through a
ZigBee wireless link. The GPS receiver is connected to the
GSM module through an RS232 wired interface. The CO2
sensor reports its readings periodically at a fixed rate to Jennic
board inside the vehicle. The Jennic board will then average
these readings, combine them with the current location of the
vehicle, and report to the monitoring server via GSM short
messages. The reporting will follow the requested rate.

Fig. 4 demonstrates our monitoring results at the National
Chiao-Tung University (NCTU) campus. The monitoring re-
gion is approximately 80 hectares and is partitioned into
5 × 4 grids. The observed CO2 concentration ranges from
380 ppm to 429 ppm. Each circle indicates the monitoring
position and its color represents the corresponding level of
CO2 concentration. Users can click on each circle to obtain
the detailed data.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed a new architecture based
on VSNs for micro-climate monitoring. Through GSM short
messages and geographic locations of vehicles, we can use a
small number of vehicles to realize a fine-grained monitoring
in urban areas. To balance between the monitoring quality
and the message cost, we have designed an adaptive approach
to adjust the reporting rates of sensing vehicles according to
the variance of sensing readings and the density of vehicles

tion is beyond a dangerous threshold, VS3 will send a short
message to a predefined phone number. The user can then
activate MMS or video call with the car unit. In Fig. 2(b),
we demonstrate a burglarproof application. When a poten-
tial burglar event is detected (such as doors being opened),
VS3 will send the owner a short message. Since an imme-
diate action is needed, VS3 will directly record a video clip
and send it to the owner via MMS. More importantly, the
video clip is a critical clue and evidence in a lawsuit.
In the tracking part, Fig. 2(c) shows a surveillance sce-
nario. Through its camera, VS3 will continuously take snap-
shots on neighboring vehicles. VS3 will retrieve these license
plate numbers and compare them against a database of sus-
picious plate numbers provided by the police department
(through the Internet or nearby police cars). When a sus-
picious vehicle is identified, the on-board unit can trans-
mit a report message to the police department via 3G net-
works. The police department then can take further actions.
In addition, the on-board unit can broadcast this message
to neighboring vehicles by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) com-
munications (through IEEE 802.11p [1] interfaces). Thus,
the traces of suspicious vehicles can be continuously logged,
which are valuable clues to the police department. This
brings up a new challenge of how to conduct cooperative
tracking by general vehicles on the street.
3. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION
We have developed a prototype of VS3. The micropro-
cessor in the car unit is an ARM9 Mini2440 [2] with a 3.5”
TFT LCD, as shown in Fig. 3(a). It is equipped with a
CAM130 camera, which has a 400MHz 32-bit RISC inte-
ger processor (ARM920T [3]), 64MB SDRAM, 64MB Nand
Flash, Camera Interface, three serial ports, and a 10/100M
Ethernet RJ-45. Mini 2440 can issue snapshot commands to
Figure 4: Prototyping demonstration.
CAM130 for taking full-resolution pictures. To output the
captured video data to an image file, the jpeg library, lib-
jpeg, is linked to the executable program. The CO2 module
is a H-550EV CO2 sensor [4] integrated with Jennic JN5139
[5] as shown in Fig. 3(b), which has 0∼5,000 ppm measure-
ment range and ±30 ppm accuracy. The 3G module is the
Wavecom Q2403A GSM/GPRS/CDMA module as shown
in Fig. 3(c), which is controlled by Mini2440 via AT com-
mands. The GPS module is implemented by uPatch300 [6],
as shown in Fig. 3(d), which follows the NMEA (National
Marine Electronics Association) 0183 protocol.
For license plate recognition (LPR), we integrate a soft-
ware with the following functions: plate localization, plate
orientation and sizing, normalization and edge detection,
character segmentation, and optical character recognition.
For car security, we demonstrate a door-trigger scenario as
shown in Fig. 4(a) and a CO2-monitoring scenario in a model
car as shown in Fig. 4(b). For car tracking demonstrations,
Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(d) show our prototyping system set up
in a real car and a suspicious vehicle tracking scenario, re-
spectively.

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a Vehicular Surveil-
lance and Sensing System (VS3), which targets at car
security applications. On the car side, it consists of a
sensing module, a surveillance module, a communication
module, and a control module with a microprocessor. On
the user side, when he/she leaves the car, only a 3G mobile
phone is needed. VS3 can be triggered by events detected
on car, such as abnormal air quality, unusual sound
frequencies, and potential burglary. Via a 3G module, a
user can have multimedia communications with the car
unit. Application scenarios include detecting an abnormal
CO2 level, unusual sound frequencies, or potential car
burglary, which triggers VS3 to transmit SMS, MMS, or
interactive video calls to the vehicle owner, who can then
monitor the car situation. This paper demonstrates our
current prototype.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of micro-sensing MEMS and
wireless communication technologies has made vehic-
ular sensor networks (VSNs) possible. In a VSN, a
number of sensors are placed on vehicles to collect
environment data and these sensed data can be utilized
for various purposes, such as vehicle tracking [2], crash
prevention [3], environment monitoring [7], and mobile
surveillance [8].
On the other hand, 3G/3.5G mobile systems are fast
developing and widely deployed. This would greatly
enrich the interaction between users and VSNs. For ex-
ample, a burglarproof system can provide video calls be-
tween a user and the on-board unit. As another example,
traditional surveillance systems for vehicle monitoring

grants 96-2218-E-009-004, 97-3114-E-009-001, 97-2221-E-009-142-
MY3, and 98-2219-E-009-005, by MOEA 98-EC-17-A-02-S2-0048

rely on roadside cameras for video recording. It requires
huge efforts to distinguish targets from many other candi-
dates and also a lot of labors to go through these videos.
With 3G/3.5G systems, such video-recording work can
be done in an on-demand manner via on-street vehicles.
In this work, we propose a 3G-enhanced VSN called
vehicular surveillance and sensing system (VS3). On
the user side, only a 3G mobile phone is needed. On
the car side, the on-board unit consists of a sensing
module (such as CO2 sensor and microphone), a surveil-
lance module (such as a camera and some recognition
software), a communication module (such as 3G and
WAVE/DSRC), and a control module with a micropro-
cessor. The microprocessor is responsible for issuing
commands and coordinating with other modules. VS3
can be triggered by events detected by the car. We will
show how events of abnormal air quality, unusual sound
frequencies, and potential burglary can be exploited.
This allows the surveillance module to be activated in
an on-demand manner. Thus, VS3 can avoid recording
unnecessary videos when nothing happens. Alternatively,
for simpler events, VS3 can transmit SMS (short message
service) or MMS (multimedia message service) to the
vehicle owner, who can then decide whether to initiate
a video call. This paper demonstrates our current proto-
type.
II. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND APPLICATIONS
Fig. 1 shows the VS3 architecture. On the car side,
it consists of the following components: a CO2 sensor
for detecting the CO2 level inside vehicle, a microphone
for detecting unusual sound frequencies inside vehicle,
a camera module for taking photos or recording videos
inside the car, a 3G module for transmitting SMS,
MMS, or interactive video calls, and a microprocessor
for controlling all these components. On the user side,
only a 3G mobile phone is needed to receive warning

B. CO2 Sensor
The CO2 module has a H-550EV CO2 sensor [5]
integrated with Jennic JN5139 [6], which is mounted
to Mini2440 via an UART interface. Our prototype
is shown in Fig. 7. The CO2 sensor module has
0∼5,000ppm measurement range and ±30ppm accuracy.
JN5139 has a 16MIPs 32-bit RISC processor, a 2.4GHz
IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceiver, 192kB of ROM,
and 96kB of RAM. In particular, JN5139 allows the

flexibility of supporting mesh networking and packet
routing inside a vehicle. To obtain sensing data from the
CO2 sensor, a character device (such as ”/dev/ttySAC#”)
in Linux is opened to read/write data from/to the serial
port.
C. 3G Module
We adopt the Wavecom Q2403A GSM/GPRS/CDMA
module as shown in Fig. 8, which is controlled by
Mini2440 via AT commands. It performs SMS, MMS,
and video calls as instructed by the ARM9 board. To
