self-diffusion and mixing behaviour of cohesive powders with the effect of liquid bridge in a 
vibrated bed. Their simulation results revealed a strong dependency of the diffusion and mixing 
coefficients on the interstitial liquid fraction. The mixing rate constant had a power law dependence 
on the diffusion coefficient in both the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. Lu and Hsiau 
[10] simulated the mixing behaviour of spherical particles in vibrated beds with the effect of 
electrostatic force using 3D discrete element simulation. The simulation outcomes showed that the 
granular temperature increased linearly with the increasing electrostatic number (Es), which is 
defined as the ratio of the electrostatic force to the particle weight, and that the mixing rate constant 
and Es number had a power law relationship. Lu and Hsiau [11] further employed 3D discrete 
element simulation to investigate the influence of vibration conditions on the mixing behaviour. 
They concluded that the dimensionless convection flow rate and vertical self-diffusion coefficient 
increased as the vibration acceleration increased. The mixing rate increased exponentially with the 
dimensionless convection flow rate and vertical self-diffusion coefficient. Tatemoto et al. [12] used 
3D discrete element simulation to study the flow behaviour of spherical particles in a vibrated bed 
with an inner tube. The bed height difference between the interior and annulus of the inner tube was 
predicted to be greatly affected by the ratio of the interior cross sectional area to the annulus cross 
sectional area. The bed height difference determined the direction and velocity of the particle 
circulation. Majid and Walzel [13] conducted experiment and 3D discrete element simulation to 
study the convection behaviour of spherical glass beads within a vertically vibrated bed. The 
patterns of convection rolls were found to be dependent upon the vibration conditions. 
The experimental and numerical studies in the last few decades focused on the dynamics of 
spherical or nearly spherical granular beds under external vibration. There have been relatively 
fewer papers studying vibrated granular beds consisting of non-spherical particles whilst most real 
particles in industrial applications are not spheres. There is thus a need to explore the dynamic 
behaviour of non-spherical particulate systems. 
The aim of this project is to investigate the convection behaviour of non-spherical particles in a 
vibrating bed by using physical experiment and DEM simulation. The secondary objective of the 
project is to develop an improved PTV technique to measure translational and rotational velocities 
for non-spherical particles. Finally, we validated the DEM results against the corresponding 
experimental results. The non-spherical particles used in this study were paired particles, composed 
of two single beads. In the improved PTV technique, auto-correlation method was extended to 
process stored images and to resolve the translation and rotation of each tracer particle in every two 
consecutive images. In order to enhance computational accuracy, the bi-cubic interpolation scheme 
was used during image rotation and the correction method of the gray-level derivatives was 
incorporated for auto-correlation. In the discrete element modeling, the Hertz-Mindlin no-slip 
contact model with damping and a frictional slider in the tangential direction was used to model 
particle collision and the multi-sphere method was adopted to represent the paired particles. To 
achieve a high level quantitative validation, the particle properties required for DEM simulation 
were not simply assumed but measured directly. The apparatuses to measure the friction and

using an image acquisition system. This system consisted of a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera 
(IDT MotionPro X3 PLUS with 8GB RAM), a 50 mm Nikkor (f/1.4) lens and a PC. A 650W 
tungsten halogen light (dedolight DLH650) was used as a light source. Every image of the motion 
was digitized to gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255 according to the color difference between the 
black background particles and white tracer particles. These digital images were then transferred to 
the personal computer and stored for further analysis.

Improved particle tracking velocimetry 
Figure 3 shows two successive images at time 1t  and 2t  respectively. A typical non-spherical 
tracer particle in the first image ( 1t ) is located in a small window ( 11 MN × pixels), whereas a larger 
window ( 22 MN ×  pixels) is allocated in the second image ( 2t ). The centroid O of this identified 
tracer particle in the first image corresponds to point A in the second image. The particle translates 
from position A to position B with xδ  and yδ and rotates from orientation C to orientation D with 
δθ . Considering a very small time increment, the position of this particle should be located in this 
large window. The auto-correlation technique (Hsiau and Shieh [35]) was extended to process the 
images and to resolve the translation ( xδ and yδ ) and rotation (δθ ) of each tracer particle in every 
two successive images. The correction of the pixel-value derivatives in the x and y directions is also 
considered for auto-correlation in order to increase the computational accuracy. The methodology is 
described below.

In addition, by fitting a quadratic surface to the neighborhood of its maximum, the sub pixel 
accuracy of the translation, xˆδ and yˆδ , can be achieved (Press et al. [37]) and expressed in Eqs. (7)

the system approached zero (<10-8 J) and the mean unbalanced force approached zero (<10-7 N), 
compared to a single paired particle weight of 9.2×10-4 N. After achieving the filled state, the shaker 
with frequency f  and acceleration a  was then applied to vibrate the paired particles vertically.

Transport properties 
The transport properties associated with convection rolls in a vibrated granular bed include the 
local average velocities, local fluctuation velocities, granular temperatures, fluctuation velocity 
distributions and self-diffusion coefficients. It should be noted that in addition to the contribution 
from particle translation, the transport properties have to consider the involvement from particle 
rotation. These are described below. 
Consider that the granular bed is divided into M rows and N columns with the thm  row from 
the bottom of the bed in the vertical direction and the thn  column from the left of the bed in the 
horizontal direction. The local average velocities in each sub-region, defined in Eq. (11), are 
averaged from the translational and rotational velocities of tracer particles, which are determined 
from the particle displacements and rotations per vibration cycle at the same phase angle.

corresponding to the x-directional, y-directional and rotational fluctuation velocities respectively. 
The velocity fluctuation induces the self-diffusion in granular flows. The diffusion coefficients 
can be calculated by continuously tracking the diffusive displacements of particles. The 
self-diffusion coefficient (Hsiau and Shieh [35]), ijD , is defined as Eq. (17).

Results and discussions 
When the vibration condition with frequency Hzf 25=  and acceleration ga 2.11=  (g= 
9.81m/s2) was applied to the container, convection phenomena of the paired POM particles were 
observed in the experiment. The same vibration condition was also applied in the DEM simulation 
for comparison. Spatial variations of the local velocity and granular temperature were evaluated by 
dividing the container into 16 rows x 16 columns giving 256 square interrogation sub-regions. The 
size of each sub-region is 10 mm which is 1.25 times the major dimension of the paired POM 
particles. The local average velocities were averaged from 35 tracer particles taken from 3001 
frames in the experiment and DEM simulation. Figure 6 shows the local translational velocity 
vectors of the paired POM particles for the experiment and simulation. The DEM predicted 
translational velocity field matches well with the measured one. Both results show that two 
convection cells formed in this vibrated bed. The particles in the right part circulated clockwise, 
whilst the particles in the left part circulated counter-clockwise. The particles moved upward in the 
center and moved downward along container walls. The motion in the upper region of the vibrated 
bed was more fluidized and excited than that in the lower region. The pair of convection rolls is 
thus fairly symmetric about the centerline. Figure 7 shows the local rotational velocity field of the 
paired POM particles for both results. Each spiral in the figure represents the computed local 
rotational velocity. One circle means that the rotational velocity is π2  rad/sec. Similarly, π4  
rad/sec is for two circles. Both results show that the particles rotated violently in the upper part and 
rotated slightly near the boundaries. It can be seen from Figs. 6 and 7 that these tracer particles not 
only translated but also rotated in this vibrated bed. 
The granular temperature distribution of the entire bed for the experiment and simulation is

The global average velocities were also averaged from 35 tracer particles taken from 3001 
frames in the experiment and DEM simulation. Figure 9 shows the measured and predicted 
fluctuation velocity distributions for x-directional velocity, y-directional velocity and rotational 
velocity respectively. The DEM predicted fluctuation velocity distributions for y-directional and 
rotational velocities are in good agreement with those from the experiment. The DEM simulation 
however produces discrepancy with the experiment in the x-directional fluctuation velocity 
distribution. Both results all show that the fluctuation velocity distributions are close to the 
Maxwellian distribution. It can be seen from Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) that the shape of fluctuation 
velocity distribution in the vertical direction is flatter than that in the horizontal direction. This is 
because the external vibration is vertical, providing more work for the system in the vertical 
direction and giving the particles more energy to disperse in the vertical direction. Figure 9(c) 
reveals that roughly 60% of the rotational velocities are in the range from -150 (o/sec) to +150 (o/sec)

Conclusions 
The convection behaviour of non-spherical particles in a vibrating bed has been investigated by using 
physical experiment and DEM simulation. The non-spherical particles used in this study were paired 
POM particles made by gluing two single POM beads. The improved PTV technique for measuring 
the translational and rotational velocities of non-spherical particles has been developed. The 
apparatuses of the three-particle sliding test, repose angle test and drop test have been built to 
measure the friction and restitution coefficients for DEM models. The transport properties related to 
convection rolls in a vibrated granular bed such as the local average velocities, local fluctuation 
velocities, granular temperatures, fluctuation velocity distributions and self-diffusion coefficients
