strength, ease of preparation, low cost, and high 
selectivity, allow MIP to be used in antibody/ 
receptor binding site mimicking, chemical sensors, 
biosensors, and tailor-made separation [6,7].  
Dickey firstly demonstrated an MIP synthesis for a 
specific dye molecule with a silica gel [8], which 
was formed from combination of a silica solution 
and an alkylorange.  Recently, a number of studies 
have shown that phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMOS) 
is a good monomer for templates containing phenyl 
group in organic-inorganic hybrid MIP [9-13].  
PTMOS, which contains phenyl and silane groups, 
could provide pi-pi interaction with a template at the 
phenyl group and react with tetramethoxysilane 
(TMOS) to form MIP in a sol-gel process.  Marx 
et al. also showed that the propranolol-imprinted 
polymer synthesized by this type of sol-gel method 
had lower uptake and remarkably lower 
nonspecific binding amount of propranolol than 
that synthesized with acrylic monomers [13]. 
Catecholamine-imprinted polymers have been 
successfully synthesized from several materials 
including acrylic polymer, silica, and poly(3- 
aminophenylboronic acid) to recognize a template 
in a sensing system [9,14-18].  For example, Lu et 
al. combined the techniques of chemilumine- 
scence and EP imprinted polymer to detect 
recovered EP from serum samples [14].   
In this work, the EP-imprinted silica film was 
prepared using PTMOS and tetraethyl orthosilicate 
(TEOS) as the functional monomer and crosslinker, 
respectively, in the presence of EP, which was the 
template molecule.  PTMOS was chosen as the 
functional monomer to provide pi-pi interaction with 
the phenyl group in EP.  An indium tin oxide glass 
(ITO) coated with EP-imprinted silica film was 
used as the sensing material to obtain an electro- 
chemical signal for the oxidation of EP.  A 
mechanism of facilitated transport of fixed site 
carriers was introduced to explain the enhancement 
of current with MIP, as depicted in Figure 1.  The 
mechanism of facilitated transport of fixed site 
carriers has been extensively applied in gas 
separation membranes [19-23].  In the membrane 
the fixed site carriers were covalently bound to the 
membrane phase.  Transport facilitated by fixed 
site carriers was based on the reversible chemical 
reaction between solute and carrier sites.  
Continuous repetition of adsorption and desorption 
of the solute with nearby carrier sites resulted in 
“jumping” of the solute between carrier sites 
throughout the membrane, and eventually 
facilitating the transport of solute in membrane.  
Kuraoka et al. showed the facilitated transport of 
ethylene in inorganic-organic hybrid membrane 
[23].  Martin et al. also showed that bioreceptors, 
such as apoenzymes and antibodies, could be used 
as fixed site carriers for facilitated transport of 
antigen and molecules that could be recognized by 
apoenzymes [24,25].  Based on this mechanism, 
EP was expected to form reversible complexes with 
the binding sites in MIP and be transported through 
the MIP film for enhanced electrochemical 
reaction.

The chemicals used for this report were from 
several sources.  Tetraethyl orthosilicate (98 %) 
was purchased from Acros.  Phenyltrimethoxy- 
silane (purum), 2-phenethylamine (2-PA, purum), 
and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN, purum) were 
purchased from Fluka.  (-)-Epinephrine, (-)-iso- 
proterenol hydrochloride, 3,4-dihydroxy-L- 
phenylalanine (L-DOPA), and tyr-tyr-tyr were 
purchased from Sigma.  3,4-Dihydroxyhy- 
drocinnamic acid (DOPAC, 98 %) and L-ascorbic 
acid (AA, ACS) were purchased from Aldrich and 
Riedel-deHaen, respectively.  NaH2PO4 (101.9 %) 
and Na2HPO4 (99.7 %) were purchased from J.T. 
Baker.  Ethoxyethanol (95 %) and hydrochloric 
acid (35 %) were purchased from Fisher and 
Showa, respectively. 
 
2.2 ITO Electrode Pretreatment. 
A piece of ITO glass (50 x 10 x 0.8 mm3, 
surface resistance < 10 ohm, Shinan SNP Co., Ltd.) 
was first immersed in acetone and 2-propanol for 
15 min each in an ultrasonic bath, then rinsed in 
2-propanol, and finally dried by blowing with 
nitrogen gas.  The conductive side of the glass 
was covered with a piece of tape to leave an 
opening area of 100 mm2 (10 x 10 mm2). 
 
2.3 EP-Imprinted Sol-Gel Film. 
An organic-inorganic hybrid sol was prepared 
by mixing 4.55 ml (20 mmol) TEOS, 3 ml 
ethoxyethanol, 0.74 ml (4 mmol) PTMOS, 0.7 ml 
deionized water, and 1 ml 0.1 M hydrochloric acid.  
The sol was stirred for about 2 hr to be a stock 
solution.  Two milliliters of this stock solution 
was doped by adding 18 mg (0.1 mmol) EP and 8.7 
µl concentrated hydrochloric acid to have a molar 
ratio of TEOS : PTMOS : EP as 1 : 0.2 : 0.025.  
After stirring for 30 min, 100 µl of the doped sol 
was dropped on a precleaned ITO electrode and 
spin coated for 20 s at ca. 3000 rpm.  The coated 
electrode was dried in the air for one day under 
ambient conditions (relative humidity 30~50% and 
room temperature) and then immersed in phosphate 
 4 
Ag/AgCl) with stepwise increases of the EP 
concentration from 0.1 mM to 1mM on bare, MIP, 
and NIP electrodes are shown in Figure 5(A).  
Each concentration change caused a current change.  
At high concentration, the current of the MIP- 
modified electrode decreased steadily following a 
current change after concentration change.  Figure 
5(B) shows the calibration curves and each data is 
the average from six experiments.  The current 
changes were calculated as the current differences 
before and after the concentration changes.  The 
mechanism of facilitated transport was applied to 
explain the greater current change with MIP 
electrode than with NIP electrode.  It is believed 
that MIP was capable of facilitating transport of EP.  
Based on this mechanism, EP formed a reversible 
complex with the binding sites, so there was 
jumping between nearby binding sites in MIP.  
The binding sites in the EP imprinted polymer, 
which selectively adsorbed EP, functioned as the 
fixed site carriers that facilitated transport and 
provided higher electrochemical current.  Without 
specific binding sites, the NIP electrode gave only 
a low current.  The current change for MIP was 
proportional to the concentration of EP with a slope 
of 71 µA/mM in concentrations lower than 0.5 mM.  
The slope decreased in higher concentrations, 
which was probably related to the saturation of 
binding sites with EP and it has also been observed 
in other studies on facilitated transport [24, 25].  
At low concentration, the sensing current was due 
to the rates of both facilitated and unfacilitated 
transport of EP; where at a high concentration, the 
binding sites were too fully occupied to further 
facilitate the transport of EP.  Therefore, current 
was only due to the unfacilitated (diffusion) 
transport according to Fick’s law [29].  
    Figure 5(A) indicates that the current 
responses reached constants on both bare and NIP 
electrodes over the whole concentration range.  
Nevertheless, the current response steadily 
decreased on MIP electrodes at high concentrations.  
This phenomenon became more significant at 
higher concentrations.  The concentration range, 
higher than 0.5 mM, for this phenomenon was 
similar with that for binding sites saturated with EP, 
as mentioned above.  The decrease in current 
response may be because a portion of binding sites 
were occupied with adrenalinequinone, the 
oxidized product, which decreased the number of 
available binding sites for EP.  At high EP 
concentration, decreased availability of binding 
sites resulted in a decrease of electrochemical 
current. 
 
3.3 Role of Binding Sites in Facilitated Transport. 
In order to confirm the role of binding sites in 
facilitated transport and explain the decrease in 
current response with time, 2-PA was introduced as 
a competitor for the binding sites.  2-PA is 
electrochemically inert and structurally resembles 
EP.  The competition between EP and 2-PA with 
initial EP concentrations of 0.6 mM and 0.1 mM is 
shown in Figure 6.  The two selected concen- 
trations of EP were either lower than or about the 
concentration at which binding sites were saturated.  
The current remained constant for the bare 
electrode in 0.6 mM EP and the MIP-modified 
electrode in 0.1 mM.  However, the current 
decreased with time for the MIP-modified 
electrode in 0.6 mM EP.  The current on a 
MIP-modified electrode dropped significantly as 
2-PA was added into 0.6 mM of EP, but remained 
constant as 2-PA was added into 0.1 mM solution.  
The current on a bare electrode kept constant as 
2-PA was added into 0.6 mM of EP.  Therefore, 
the current drop on a MIP-modified electrode in the 
same condition implied a condition change on 
binding sites after addition of 2-PA.  As 2-PA was 
added into the solution, a portion of binding sites in 
MIP were occupied with 2-PA.  In the solution of 
0.1 mM EP, the changes of availability of binding 
sites for EP was believed to be small because the 
current could remain constant after 2-PA had been 
added.  This phenomenon may be attributed to the 
abundance of available binding sites for both 
molecules even after 2-PA was added.  On the 
contrary, the portion of binding sites occupied with 
2-PA significantly reduced the current on the 
MIP-modified electrode in 0.6 mM EP.  This was 
because in 0.6 mM EP, the binding sites occupied 
with 2-PA significantly limited the availability of 
binding sites for EP when the binding sites were 
nearly saturated with EP before 2-PA added.  
Compared to the results for the bared electrode, the 
current decrease on MIP-modified electrode was 
related to the decreased availability of binding sites 
for EP, and therefore the current enhancement by 
MIP may be attributed to the facilitated transport of 
EP by binding sites.  Square wave voltammo- 
grams in 0.1 mM EP with a bare electrode are 
shown in Figure 7(A).  After amperometric 
measurement for 1 hr, a reduction peak at 0.5 V (vs. 
Ag/AgCl) was believed to be due to the reduction 
of AQ, the oxidized product of EP.  In order to 
confirm the occupation of the binding sites by AQ 
during amperometric measurement, the amount of 
AQ in EP-imprinted films were examined by 
square wave voltammograms in a fresh buffer 
solution.  The square wave voltammograms are
