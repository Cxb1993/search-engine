significantly.  Through recrystallization, the matrix structure transformed from 
long-thin grains to equiaxed grains.  The microstructure of the free air ball (FAB) of 
the various annealed wires after an EFO process were column-like grains.  The 
column-like grains grew from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) to the Ag ball.  Under the 
thermal effect of EFO, the necks of the Ag balls underwent recrystallization and grain 
growth was induced, and the annealed Ag wires had a shorter zone of HAZ (220μm).

1. Introduction 
Thermosonic ball bonding is one of the preferred processes for electronic 
packaging to connect a semiconductor chip and a lead frame by a thin metal wire.  At 
present, gold wire and copper wire are the preferred interconnect materials to bond with 
the aluminum metallized wafer pads [1-2].  Since gold is expensive and the reliability 
of copper is poorer [3], the study of silver wire has attracted a lot of attention already.  
In addition, the inherent properties of high ductility and low hardness of silver as well as 
its workability effectiveness compared to gold, have made it a preferred alternative 
[4-5].     
In general, three factors affect the reliability of metal wire bonding [6-7] namely: 1. 
Oxidation causes unusual bonding, 2. The lower strength of the annealed wire results in 
the breakage, 3. The interface properties of the pad affect the bonding strength and the 
fracture mechanism.  As-drawn silver wire possesses higher strength and hardness, 
however its lower ductility reduces the reliability of bonding.  Therefore the annealing 
treatment of as-drawn silver wire is very important.  Many studies [2-3, 6] have 
discussed the process variables of Au and Cu wires such as bonding force, temperature 
and electric flame-off (EFO), etc.  However, the recrystallization effect in the 
had a diameter of =23 μm and length of 30 mm.  In addition, the tensile test results of 
each wire had a constant strain rate of 2.54 cm/min and each analysis datum is the 
average of 20 test results (including the neck of the Ag ball).   
With an aim to understand the tensile deformation mechanism of the wire, the 
tensile fracture characteristics were observed using OM and SEM. Micro-hardness 
measurements (Vickers Hardness:Shimadzu HMV-2000L) were performed on a cross 
section of the un-annealed, annealed silver wires, the ball and the HAZ.  The force was 
5g and the holding time was 10 sec [11-12].  Each analysis datum is the average of at 
least 10 test results. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
3-1 The microstructure and the mechanical properties of the silver wires 
The cross section microstructures of the as-drawn and annealed wires are shown in 
Fig. 3.  The structure of the as-drawn wire contained some long, thin grains parallel to 
the direction of the wire-drawn process (see Fig. 3 (a)).  Fig. 3 (b) shows the structure 
of the 225℃ annealed wire.  A few equiaxed grains were found in the inside of wire.  
The microstructures of both the 250℃and 275℃ annealed wires are shown in Fig. 3 (c) 
and Fig. 3 (d), revealing that they both contained fully annealing equiaxed grains and 
the grain size of annealed wire had increased with increasing the annealed temperature 
from 225℃ to 275℃.  In addition, the grain size and grain number of the silver wires 
were measured as shown in Fig. 4 and some unusual large equiaxed grains were found 
in the 275℃ annealed wire (see Fig. 4 (d), grain size 16~24m).  
To investigate further, the micro-hardness was measured parallel to the wire 
direction on the cross section of the silver wires, as shown in Fig. 5.  The evidence 
reveals that the hardness had a V-curve tendency [13-14].  The hardness of the 
annealed wires had reduced significantly compared with the un-annealed wire.  Fig. 6 
shows a comparison of the tensile test results of the silver wires with various annealing 
temperatures.  The total elongation (T. E.) of the as-drawn wire was low at about 10%.  
When the annealing temperature was 250℃, both the U.T.S. and Y.S. decreased and the 
elongation raised significantly (~17%).  At an even higher annealing temperature, the 
results of the 275℃ wire were still similar to those of the 250℃ wire.  Notably, the 
and 250℃ annealed wires, the length of the HAZ was 420μm and 220μm respectively. 
 
3-3 FAB fracture mechanism and breakage site analysis of bonded Al pad  
To understand the tensile strength of the neck, the silver balls of the unannealed 
wire and the annealed wires were measured, as shown in Fig. 10.  The EFO process 
made the neck hardness and strength of the balls lower than that of the without-EFO 
wires (see Fig. 9).  In addition, the yield strength (YS) of the necks of the Ag balls had 
a tendency to increase after annealing.  In elongation data, the annealed wire with EFO 
had higher ductility.  The evidence reveals that the balls of the fully annealed wires 
possessed greater neck-strength.  In other words, the heat effect induced by the EFO 
process reduced the deformation resistance of the HAZ.  In addition, the breakage site 
of the EFO wires occurred in the HAZ.  Clearly, the deformation resistance of the HAZ 
was lower than that of the neck of the solidification ball.  Even though the neck of the 
solidification ball experienced a stress concentration effect at the nucleus of the 
column-like grains, its deformation resistance was still higher than the HAZ. 
After bonding on 500nm Al pads, the breakage samples of the pull test were also 
investigated (Fig. 11). Pull fracturing took place at equal-diameter grains and coarse 
grains within or around 100 μm away from the bonds (Fig. 11 (a)(b)).  The breakage 
sites of the bond pull test were a little different from those of FAB tensile test.  The 
gauge length of the bonds in the pull test (30mm) was shorter than the FAB tensile test 
(100mm), and this may have caused the deformation to localize in the region of 
equal-diameter grains and coarse grains more easily.  Notably, the breakage site also 
occurred in the bonding interface and caused the peeling (Fig. 11 (c)).  This reveals that 
the bonding process failed.   
The preferred breakage sites can be divided into two groups: one far from the 
bonds (in the HAZ), and the other is close to the bonds (behind the neck).  Fig. 12 
shows the binding strength of the two groups after pull testing.  It can be observed that 
the breakage sites appeared near the equal-diameter grains or coarse grains.  Because 
columnar grains and fine equiaxed grains have higher deformation resistance [13-14, 18], 
they would be obstacles when the equal-diameter grains or coarse grains deformed and 
then fractured nearby.  The results of bonding after the pull test proved clearly that the
