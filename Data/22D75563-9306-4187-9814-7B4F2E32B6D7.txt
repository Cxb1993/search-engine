Introduction 
There are relatively very few studies on quasi-static coupled thermoelasticity for laminated 
conical shells under various mechanical loads, although there have been many studies on the 
structure of thin conical shells [1-6]. Sherief and Anwar [7] discussed the problem of an annular 
infinitely long elastic circular cylinder whose inner and outer surfaces are subject to known 
temperature and are traction free. Based on the governing equations of three-dimensional elasticity, 
an asymptotic theory was presented by Wu and Chiu [8] for the thermoelastic buckling analysis of 
laminated composite conical shells subjected to a uniform temperature change.  
The problem of interaction between the elastic or thermoelastic field and the electromagnetic 
field has been a research topic for a number of investigations in recent years because of its 
utilitarian aspects in various branches of science and technology, like geophysics for understanding 
the effect of the Earth’s magnetic field on seismic waves, damping of acoustic waves in a magnetic 
field, emissions of electromagnetic radiations from nuclear devices, development of a highly 
sensitive superconducting magnetometer, electrical power engineering, optics, and plasma physics. 
Among such investigations, the problems of propagation of plane waves in a thermoelastic solid in 
the presence of a steady magnetic field have been considered [9-15]. 
Chen et al. [16,17] presented a new numerical technique-hybrid numerical method for the 
 4 
Furthermore, the outer and inner temperatures are assumed to be 1f  and 2f , respectively. 
The temperatures at both ends are assumed to be 3f  and 4f , respectively. 
The constitutive relations including the thermal effect for the thk  layer of the conical shell 
are given by

Since the ( 22 NN × ) matrix ][M  is a nonsingular real matrix, matrix ][M  possesses a set of 
2N  linearly independent eigenvectors, hence matrix ][M  is diagonalizable. There exists a 
nonsingular transition matrix ][P  such that [M]diag[M][P][P]-1 = , in which the original matrix 
][M  is similar to the diagonal matrix [M]diag , where matrix [M]diag  is defined as

displacement in z-direction is decreasing. Figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) show the x-direction 
displacement varying in the z and x directions of the laminated circular conical shells for 0H =0, 
6105× and 710  at t =5, respectively. The locations of the points of maximum x-direction 
displacement xu  along the z-direction occur at the center. As the initial constant magnetic field 
vector increases, we can see the variations of the displacement. Figures 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) show the 
thermal stress distribution zσ  along the z and x directions for 0H =0, 
6105× and 710  at t =5, 
respectively. From these figures, the locations of the points of maximum stress zσ  occur at the 
inner surfaces (at z =1). The z-direction thermal stress changes slightly with respect to initial 
constant magnetic field vector. Larger the surrounding temperatures will have greater thermal 
stress zσ . Figures 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c) show the circumferential stress σθ  along the z and x 
directions of the laminated circular conical shell for 0H =0, 
6105× and 710 at t =5, respectively. 
The locations of the points of maximum stress θσ  occur at the inner surfaces. The results show 
that when the initial constant magnetic field vector increases, the circumferential stress distribution 
changes slightly. Figures 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) show the stress distribution xσ  along the z and x 
directions of the laminated circular conical shell for 0H =0, 
6105× and 710 at t =5, respectively. 
The locations of the points of maximum stress xσ  occur at the inner surfaces. From the figures, it 
can be noted that the thermal stress distribution zσ  is larger than other thermal stress components 
because the laminated circular conical shells are subjected to pressure depending on time in the 
z-direction. Figures 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c) show the distributions of the shear stress xzτ  in the 
laminated circular conical shell at t =5 for 0H =0, 
6105× and 710 , respectively. The shear stress 
changes slightly with respect to initial constant magnetic field vector. The shear stress xzτ  is much 
smaller than the other thermal stress components.  
The above discussions demonstrate that the present method for the conical coordinates can 
obtain stable solutions at a specific time. Thus it is a powerful and efficient method for solving the 
coupled transient magnetothermoelastic problems of a circular multilayered conical shell. These 
results are specific for the boundary conditions considered, and other assumptive boundary 
conditions may have different trends.
