Kant, Immanuel 
Kant, Immanuel (1724-1804), German philosopher whose writings profoundly 
influenced Western thought. He was born in Königsberg, East Prussia (now 
Kaliningrad, Russia), on April 22, 1724. His father was a poor but respected saddler. 
The home atmosphere of strict pietistic Protestantism made a lasting impression 
upon Kant and is reflected in the rigorism of his moral doctrine. At the Collegium 
Fridericianum, he received a thorough training in Latin, but he always remembered 
with horror the "fanatical discipline" of this school. When, later, Kant emphasized 
that one ought to educate children in freedom he was reacting to the quite different 
experience of his own childhood. 
Life and Works 
At the age of 16, Kant entered the University of Königsberg, where he studied 
philosophy, mathematics, and physics, and attended lectures in theology. When, five 
years later, his father died, Kant found himself in financial difficulties that delayed 
until 1749 the publication of his first scientific work, Thoughts Concerning a True 
Estimation of the Vital Forces. His financial situation also made it necessary for him 
to serve nine years (until 1755) as a private tutor with various families in the vicinity 
of Königsberg. During this period, however, Kant not only acquired the social 
graces that later distinguished him but also accumulated an astounding knowledge in 
many fields. Moreover, his thinking matured. He published a few brief papers and, 
in 1755, anonymously, his famous General History of Nature and Theory of the 
Heavens. In that year he received his doctor's degree and became a lecturer at the 
University of Königsberg. He taught logic, metaphysics, moral philosophy, natural 
theology, and anthropology in addition to mathematics, physics, and physical 
geography. In 1770, upon submitting his inaugural dissertation, On the Form and 
Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World, he was appointed professor of 
logic and metaphysics at Königsberg. 
 58
At this time Kant's thinking was still dominated by the rationalism of Leibniz and 
Wolff, according to which conceptual analysis by itself yields true knowledge of the 
very nature of things. However, under the influence of Locke and Hume, Kant came 
to understand that logical operations, although sufficient for the organization of 
knowledge, contribute nothing to the content of knowledge, which is derived from 
experience alone. Following Hume, he distinguished between logical ground (ratio) 
and real ground (causa); but whereas Hume repudiated the principle of causality as a 
deception of our imagination, Kant retained it as a principle of nature. The result of 
these new insights led Kant to the attack upon traditional metaphysics that is the 
philosophical core of the Dreams of a Spirit-Seer. Reacting against the metaphysical 
speculations of Emanuel Swedenborg, Kant showed how easy it is, through a clever 
use of mere conceptual possibilities, to create the impression of knowledge of a 
supersensible world. Since metaphysics cannot penetrate to the ultimately real, Kant 
argued that its only legitimate task is the comprehension of the nature and 
limitations of human cognition. The aim of "critical philosophy" thus appears for the 
first time. 
Theory of Knowledge. In 1769 Kant arrived at "a great new insight" into the crucial 
distinction between the world of sense and the world of the understanding, and 
hence into a corresponding distinction in the structure of knowledge. This "new 
insight" was induced by Kant's realization of the full significance of the problem 
involved in the applicability of mathematics to the physical world. More specifically, 
how can the independence and self-evident validity of mathematical proof be 
reconciled with the applicability of mathematics to the world of things? Kant's 
solution to this problem, as presented in the dissertation of 1770, was that space and 
time are neither mere concepts of relation (as Leibniz held) nor metaphysical entities 
(as Newton maintained), but "forms of our sensibility under which alone sense 
impressions can be experienced by us." Following Leibniz, Kant distinguished 
between a world of appearance (that corresponds to our senses) and the world of true 
being (that corresponds to our understanding and reason). Again following Leibniz, 
he accepted the rationalistic-dogmatic theses that, whereas "sense impressions reveal 
 60
categories and are therefore valid for every object that appears under the forms of 
our sensibility or is thought of in terms of the categories of our understanding. 
Critique of Pure Reason. Kant believed that this work, published in 1781, 
demolished all speculative metaphysics and natural theology but provided a 
dependable foundation for science. His conclusion was that cognition is restricted to 
the realm of phenomena, and that we can know nothing that cannot be given through 
our senses. Within these limitations, however, we may have valid empirical 
knowledge (derived from observation and culminating in the special laws of nature), 
and a cognition a priori of the universal conditions that make nature itself and a 
science of nature possible. The empirical knowledge of special laws is the proper 
province of the scientist; the cognition a priori is that of the philosopher of nature. 
Kant dealt with this in his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. His first 
step beyond the conclusions of the Critique of Pure Reason was the introduction of 
the empirical concept "matter" by applying the category "substance" to the 
appearances of the "outer sense" (space). Initially, for Kant, matter was a movable 
substance in space. However, this concept gradually gave way in Kant's thinking to 
that of "force," for matter does not simply occupy space, but occupies it under the 
dynamic aspects of attraction and repulsion. Repudiating the philosophical atomism 
of his time, Kant thus accepted a theory of the dynamic continuity of forces. But it 
follows from the principle of causality that every change of a material body in space 
must have a cause external to itself. The transition from rest into motion and from 
motion into rest must therefore have an external cause, and this fact logically implies 
the law of inertia. Furthermore, it follows from the category "interaction" and the 
law of inertia that, in the transmission of motion, action and counteraction must 
always be equal. Kant thus shows that the whole of Newtonian mechanics can be 
deduced a priori from the fundamental conditions of empirical cognition as such. 
Purpose in Nature. Although the universal principles of nature, being the 
indispensable conditions of the possibility of cognition, must hold for the realm of 
living beings no less than for the rest of the universe, they are not in themselves 
sufficient to explain the phenomena of life. A "mechanics of a blade of grass" is 
 62
Critical Ethics. At this point the crucial question of critical philosophy arises in a 
new form: Are there laws that determine humanity's volition in an a priori manner, 
and wherein their claim to universal validity is grounded? Kant holds that the 
existence of such laws is disclosed in the value judgments pertaining to the 
conditions of human volition. He finds, however, that two kinds of such judgments 
are possible: There are judgments of usefulness, which are conditional and therefore 
not universally valid; and moral judgments, which claim universal and unconditional 
validity. This claim to unconditional validity is justifiable only in terms of a 
universal norm that is valid for all rational beings. Such a norm, according to Kant, 
is the moral law. 
Upon the all-encompassing background of universal natural laws there arises a 
narrower realm of moral laws. A law of nature states what, under specified 
conditions, must occur and what therefore actually occurs. The moral law demands 
what ought to occur irrespective of whether or not it actually does occur. 
The question concerning the existence and validity of a priori laws in the sphere of 
morality leads at once to the question of the nature of moral laws and the possibility 
of reconciling them with the laws of nature. This question, in turn, leads to the 
problem of free will—the basic problem of critical ethics. Kant held that the moral 
value of an act stems exclusively from the inner attitude of the person, that is, from 
the "maxim" that determines the action. If the maxim is merely subjective, however, 
it cannot be a moral law. This means that a maxim takes on the character of a law 
only when all elements that may vary from person to person and from situation to 
situation are eliminated from consideration. Even an attempt to derive the moral law 
from a universal self-love must fail because self-love leads at best to hypothetical 
imperatives of the form: if you desire such and such a goal, then you must do so and 
so. Such imperatives, at best, are counsels of prudence; they are not moral laws. 
The Categorical Imperative. But if all "material determinations" of the will are 
unsuitable as foundation for the moral law, then the criterion of such a law can lie 
only in its form. As Kant put it: "Act only on that maxim through which you can at 
the same time will that it should become a universal law." A law, however, that we 
 64
When the relative rank of reason and sensuousness, demanded by the moral law, has 
become habitual, we have risen from slavery (to our appetites and passions) to that 
inner freedom which it is our duty to achieve through inner self-discipline. Only to 
the degree to which we realize this freedom have we become persons. The 
possibility of this freedom cannot be explained, however, in terms of the nature of 
humans as empirical beings, for in the realm of nature causal necessity prevails. But 
Kant points out that the moral law does not say what takes place always and 
everywhere. The basic difficulty is that the moral law demands that the will be 
capable of spontaneously originating an action that, as an actual event in space and 
time, is part of the causally determined world of phenomena. Kant's solution lies in 
the thesis that we are "citizens of two worlds." As citizens of the phenomenal world 
we are subject to causal determination, but as citizens of an intelligible world we are 
autonomous lawgivers in a universal "kingdom of ends." 
Kant's Critique of Practical Reason thus prepared the ground for the more concrete 
considerations of the Metaphysics of Morals. Here Kant distinguishes between 
juridical and moral duties. The former involve merely the conformance of our 
actions with laws; the latter pertain to moral attitudes or virtues. Again, Kant 
attempts a reconciliation of empiricism and rationalism. Empiricism sees our duties 
toward humanity in whatever will contribute to the happiness of humankind, 
whereas rationalism sees them in achieving perfection. But our own happiness 
cannot be our duty because, by natural inclination, we already strive to achieve it. 
The perfection of other persons cannot be our duty because perfection cannot be 
imposed from without; everyone must attain it for him- or herself. 
The Individual and the State. Kant's synthesis is that we ought to strive to achieve 
our own perfection and that we ought to contribute to the happiness of others. But 
since the natural freedom of people consists in their ability to act in accordance with 
their own decisions, the danger is that the various spheres of freedom of different 
persons will interfere with one another. Reason demands therefore that, in order to 
assure the freedom of others, each individual impose certain restrictions upon his or 
her own freedom. The result will be a system of laws that defines the conditions 
 66
Aesthetics. Judgments of taste, dealing with the beautiful and the sublime, also 
claim universal validity. In Part I of the Critique of Judgment, Kant shows that the 
ground of these judgments, being our experience of pleasures and displeasures, is 
subjective. The judgments, nevertheless, claim objective validity. Kant takes this to 
mean that such judgments constitute a "command" to agree with them—that is, they 
presuppose an aesthetic sense shared by all. This makes communication in aesthetic 
matters possible and elevates aesthetic experience beyond the sphere of the merely 
private and subjective. But objects are not beautiful or sublime in themselves; we 
ascribe these qualities to them because of the effects they have on us. The effects, 
however, depend on certain qualities of the objects. In the case of the beautiful, 
these qualities call forth the harmonious interplay of our imagination and 
understanding. In the case of the sublime, they lead to a pleasing resolution in an 
opposition of our sensibility and reason. The emotional and the rational aspects of 
the aesthetic experience are both incorporated into Kant's theory. Ultimately, 
however, the sensuous-intuitive object of aesthetic experience becomes for Kant a 
symbol of the morally good, a sensuous representation of a moral ideal. 
Moral Consciousness. When the moral laws are conceived as if they were imposed 
by a divine Creator, then a turn to the religious has been taken. Thus religion, for 
Kant, is but the "apprehension of all duties as divine commands." The facts of moral 
consciousness constitute the only admissible foundation for religion. The moral law 
is not compelling because it is God-given, but because it is compelling it can be 
interpreted as if it were of divine origin. There are, however, other considerations 
that lead to religion. The categorical imperative would be incomprehensible in a 
completely determined nature; religious faith may here achieve a reconciliation. The 
moral law demands unconditionally the fulfillment of duty, but the nature of a 
sensuous being (like the human being) demands happiness. Justice demands that the 
two be ultimately reconcilable, the harmony of virtue and happiness being the 
highest good. The ideal of the highest good thus presupposes a moral world order 
that, in turn, presupposes a rational will as Creator. The existence of God is 
therefore, for Kant, a "postulate of practical reason." As such it remains a matter of 
faith, not of proof.

Reinhold, in his Notes on the Philosophy of Kant (1786–1787), gave direction to that 
development; but here also Friedrich von Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich 
Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel made their 
important contributions.

???????????? 
 
The critique of Pure Reason was the work in which Kant attempted to lay the 
foundations both for the certainty of modern science and for the possibility of 
human freedom. Kant argues on several fronts against several different alternatives 
positions represented in early modern philosophy generally and within the German 
Enlightenment in particular.  
Kant attempted to criticize and limit the scope of traditional metaphysics, and 
he also sought to defend against empiricists its underlying claim of the possibility of 
universal and necessary knowledge – what Kant called a priori knowledge, 
knowledge originating independently of experience, because no knowledge derived 
from any particular experience, or a posteriori knowledge, could justify a claim to 
universal and necessary validity. He sought likewise to defend its scientific character 
against skeptics who dismiss rigorous arguments as insufficient and against 
proponents of “common sense” who regard them as pedantic (??, ??) and 
superfluous.  
Kant’s position thus required him not only to undermine the arguments of 
traditional metaphysics but also to put in their place a scientific metaphysics of his 
own, which establishes what can be known a priori but also limits it to that which is 
required for ordinary experience and its extension into natural science. 
 
The structure of the Critique 
Kant actually borrowed much of the book’s structure from well-known models. 
The Critique is divided into two parts, the “Doctrine of Elements”(???) and the 
“Doctrine of Method.”(???) The “Doctrine of Elements” in turn is divided into 
two main parts, the “Transcendental Aesthetic”(????) and the “Transcendental 
Logic,(????)” the first of which considers the a priori contributions of the 
fundamental forms of our sensibility, namely space and time, to our knowledge, and 
the second of which considers the a priori contributions of the intellect, both 
genuine and spurious(???), to our knowledge.  
After a brief of explanation of the distinction between “general logic” and 
“transcendental logic” – the former being the basic science of the forms of thought 
 72
way for his subsequent moral philosophy by contrasting the method of theoretical 
philosophy to that of practical philosophy, and giving the first outline of the 
argument that runs through all three critiques, namely that practical reason can 
justify metaphysical beliefs about god and the freedom and immortality of the 
human soul although theoretical reason can never yield knowledge of such things. 
The last two parts of the “Doctrine of Method,” the “Architectonic of Pure Reason” 
and the “History of Pure Reason,” recapitulate the contrasts between Kant’s own 
critical philosophical method and those of the dogmatists(????? ), 
empiricists(??????), and skeptics(????) with which he began treating 
these contrasts in both systematic and historical terms. 
 
“Introduction”: the idea of transcendental philosophy 
In the introduction, Kant argues that our mathematical, physical, and 
quotidian(????, ?????) knowledge of nature requires certain judgments 
that are “synthetic’ rather than “analytic,” that is, going beyond what can be known 
solely in virtue of the contents of the concepts involved in them and the application 
of the logical principles of identity and contradiction to these concepts, and also 
knowable a priori, that is, independently of any particular experience since no 
particular experience could every sufficient to establish the universal and necessary 
validity of these judgments. He entitles the question of how synthetic a priori 
judgments are possible the “general problem of pure reason”, and proposes an 
entirely new science in order to answer it. 
This new science, which Kant called “transcendental”, does not deal directly 
with objects of empirical(??????, ???, ?????) cognition, but 
investigates the conditions of the possibility of our experience of them by examining 
the mental capacities(????) that are required for us to have any cognition of 
objects at all. Kant agrees with Locke that we have no innate knowledge, that is, no 
knowledge of any particular propositions(??) implanted in us by God, or nature 
prior to the commencement(?? , ?? ) of our individual experience. But 
experience is the product both external objects affecting our sensibility and of the 
operation of our cognition faculties in response to this effect, and Kant’s claim is 
that we can have “pure” or a priori cognition of the contributions to experience made 
 74
“Transcendental analytic”: the metaphysical and transcendental 
deductions(???). 
The longest and the most varied part of the Critique is the “Transcendental 
Logic,” containing the two main divisions: the constructive “Transcendental 
Analytic,” which considers the understanding as the source of a priori concepts that 
yield a priori cognitions in conjunction with the forms of intuitions already analyzed; 
and the primarily destructive “Transcendental Dialectic,” which investigates the 
faculty of reason, in the first instance as a source of illusory arguments and 
metaphysical pseudo-sciences, although in the end also as the source of valuable 
regulative principles for the conduct of human inquiry and practical reasoning. The 
“Transcendental Analytic” is in turn divided into two books, the “Analytic of 
Concepts,” dealing with the concepts of the understanding, and “Analytic of 
Principles, concerning the principles of the understanding that arise from the 
application of those concepts to the forms of intuition. 
In the “Analytic of Concepts,” Kant presents the understanding as the source 
of certain concepts that a priori and are conditions of the possibility of any 
experience whatever. These twelve basic concepts, which Kant calls the categories, 
are fundamental concepts of an object in general, or the forms for any particular 
concepts of objects, and in conjunction with the a priori forms of intuition are the 
basis of all synthetic a priori cognition. 
 
Principles of pure understanding 
Even if the transcendental deduction does establish that the categories do apply 
to all possible data for experience, or (in Kant’s terms) all manifolds of intuition, it 
does so only abstractly and collectively – that is, it does no specify how each 
category applies necessarily to the objects given in experience or show that all of the 
categories must be applied to those objects. This is Kant’s task in Book II of the 
“Transcendental Analytic,” the “Analytic of Principles.” This book in turn divided 
into three chapters, “The Schematism(??, ????) of the Pure Concepts of the 
Understanding,” the “System of All principles of Pure Understanding,” and “On the 
Ground of the Distinction of All Objects in General into Phenomena and Noumena.”  
In the first chapter, Kant shows how the logical content of the categories 
 76
especially in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique of 
Practical Reason. 
The second and by far the larger book of the “Dialectic” expounds “The 
Dialectical Inferences of Pure Reason” in great detail. The errors of rational 
psychology are diagnoses under the rubric??????????of “The Paralogisms
??????of Pure Reason,” those of rational cosmology????? under the 
rubric of “The Antinomy?????? of Pure Reason,” and those of rational 
theology under the rubric of “The Ideal of Pure Reason.” 
The “Paralogisms”  Rational psychology is the topic of the 
“Paralogisms” (or fallacious inferences ???????) of pure reason, which 
argue invalidly from the formal unity, simplicity, and identity of the thought of the 
subject of thinking or the “I” to the conclusion that the soul is a real and simple 
(hence indestructible) substance that is self-identical throughout all experience. 
The “Antinomies” The longest and most painstaking part of the 
“Transcendental Dialectic” is the “Antinomy of Pure Reason” which deals with the 
topics of rational cosmology; Kant originally thought that all of the errors of 
metaphysics could be diagnosed in the form of these antinomies. Kant argues that 
reasons natural illusions are not merely revealed by subtle philosophical analysis but 
unavoidably manifest themselves in the form of actual contradictions each side of 
which seems naturally plausible. Kant argues that unless we accept the 
transcendental idealist. Distinction between appearances and things in themselves, 
we will be committed to accepting mutually incompatible arguments, arguments 
both that there must be a first beginning of the world in time and that there cannot be, 
there must be limits to the world in space and there cannot be (the two halves of the 
first antinomy), both that there must be simple substance and that there cannot be 
(the second antinomy), both that there must be at least one first or uncaused cause 
and being whose necessary existence is the ground of all contingent beings and that 
there can be no necessary being (the fourth antinomy). 
The only way of resolving these contradictions, Kant argues, is by accepting 
that the natural world is a realm of appearances constituted by the application of the 
categories to sensible intuitions, and not a realm of things in themselves. Regarding 
the first two antinomies, not a realm called “mathematical” antinomies because they 
 78
Kant organizes the traditional proofs of the existence of God (without 
attempting to explain why there should only be these three) into the ontological 
proof, based solely on the concept of God, the cosmological proof, based on the 
sheer fact of the existence of a world, and the physico-theological proof, based on 
the particular constitution of the actual world, especially its alleged exhibition of 
purposive design.  
Regulative use of the ideas  The outcome of the “Transcendental 
Dialectic”, therefore, seems to be entirely negative,. This is a misleading conclusion. 
In an appendix to the “Dialectic,” Kant begins a limited rehabilitation of the ideas of 
traditional metaphysics by arguing that the ideas of reason have an important 
function in the conduct of natural science if they are understood regulatively, that is, 
if they are taken to represent not metaphysical beings or entities whose reality is 
supposed to be demonstrable, but rather goals and directions of inquiry that mark out 
the ways in which our knowledge is to be sought for and organized. This is true of 
the idea of a simple soul, which stimulates us to search for a unified psychology; of 
the idea of a complete world whole, which leads us constantly to expand the domain 
of our scientific investigators; and above all of the idea of God, for regarding the 
world as if it were the product of a highest intelligent leads us to look for the 
maximum in order and connectedness, which is beneficial for the organization of 
whatever empirical knowledge we do acquire. This argument, which Kant continues 
in the Critique of Judgment, is the first of Kant’s constructive arguments that reason 
can be misleading but if wisely used is far from idle or even unnecessary. Kant’s 
second constructive argument about reason, that its ideas have a profound practical 
use for the guidance and regulation of conduct, is begun in the final part of the 
Critique, the “Doctrine of Method.” 
The “Doctrine of Method” The second major division of the Critique, 
the “Doctrine of Method,” tends to be neglected by its readers, perhaps because the 
“Doctrine of Elements” is so long and the arguments already surveyed are so 
exhausting. But the “Doctrine of Method,” is which Kant reflects upon the potential 
and the limits of his critical philosophy by comparing it with other methods – he 
compares the method of philosophy with the method of mathematics, the method of 
theoretical philosophy with the method of practical philosophy, and the method of

M. J. Platts and M. B. Yeung, Managing learning and tacit knowledge, Strategic 
change, Sept-Oct 2000, pp. 347-355. 
 
This article explores the tacit dimension of managing knowledge with the premise 
that in the West we are already comfortable with the concept of managing explicit 
knowledge. The paper is organized into three sections. First, the nature of tacit 
knowledge is examined. Second, current management approaches to transferring 
tacit knowledge are discussed and finally, the deeper implications of these 
approaches and indeed of the recognition of tacit knowledge are considered.  
  
The nature of tacit knowledge 
Polanyi first coined the term ‘tacit knowledge’, in his 1966 book The Tacit 
Dimension. In Nonaka and Takeuchi’s term, the design methodology is explicit 
knowledge, while the knowledge-in-action is tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge can 
be summarized as knowledge that has not been articulated. It may be a ‘skill’ or 
‘know how’, such as the designer’s professional knowledge-in-action or the act or 
riding a bicycle. It may include deeply held personal beliefs, perspective and values 
and mental models of the world. It is knowledge that is difficult or sometimes 
impossible to write down. 
Tacit knowledge can be subdivided into ‘tacit specific knowledge’ and ‘truly 
tacit knowledge’. ‘Tacit specific knowledge’ is knowledge that can be identified and 
made explicit upon reflection. It has usually been accumulated through experience 
but never articulated. On the other hand, ‘truly tacit knowledge’ cannot be specified. 
By definition, it is knowledge that we possess but do not actually know we possess. 
It is subconsciously integrated from explicit and tacit knowledge and may be used in 
times of heightened perceptual activity in order to solve complex problems. This 
may involve recognizing patterns and combining this ability with diffuse subsidiary 
clues. It may also include high speed and simultaneous tasks that cannot be slowed 
down or practiced slowly. 
 
 82
explicit knowledge receives. Second, that the effective sharing and creation of tacit 
knowledge requires a supportive environment. Tacit knowledge is ‘sticky’ and 
individuals must feel comfortable in order to begin to share it. This type of 
environment requires significant effort to sustain and grow. Third, that developing 
noticing skills is essential in order to manage tacit knowledge. 
 
 
J. C. Spender, Making knowledge that basis of a dynamic theory of the firm, 
Strategic management Journal, Vol. 17 (winter special Issue), 45-62. 
 
The paper begins with a multitype epistemology which admits both the pre- and 
subconscious modes of human knowing and, reframing the concepts of the 
cognizing individual, the collective knowledge of social groups. While both Nelson 
and Winter, and Nonaka and Takeuchi, successful sketch theories of the dynamic 
interactions of these types of organizational knowledge, neither indicates how they 
are to be contained. Callon and Latour suggest knowledge itself is dynamic and 
contained within actor networkers, so moving us from knowledge as a resource 
toward knowledge as a process. To simplify this approach, we revisit sociotechnical 
systems theory, adopt three heuristics from the social constructionist literature, and 
make a distinction between the systemic and component attributes of the actor 
network. 
 
We focus on the amplifying effect of the intangible knowledge that the firm’s 
members apply in the firm’s value-adding possess. This is the locus of the all 
important wedge that Penrose uses to distinguish the firm’s tangible resources from 
the services these resources provide. While the former are finite, the latter are 
mediated by the endlessly extensible body of managerial knowledge because of its 
inherently ‘public’ nature. 
 
Knowledge 
With exceptions organizational theorists have constrained their theorizing by 
adopting a positivist theory of knowledge that takes little account of the millennia of 
 84
somewhat distinct roots. The first, admirably summarized in Nonaka and Takeuchi 
(1955: 7), and epitomized in the work of Drucker, Quinn and Reich, distinguishes 
knowledge from the traditional factors of production, labor, land and capital. 
Knowledge has become the most important or ‘strategic’ factor of production, so 
managers now focus on its production, acquisition, movement, retention and 
application.  
Pragmatism (????? ), developed by Peirce, James, and Dewey, is 
quintessentially American and differs from positivism in part because it has little 
concern with universal truths, focusing instead on ‘cash value’ or ‘what works’, i.e. 
on a more immediate and less universal concept of knowledge. Functional criteria 
replace logical tests, and the positivist presupposition of a logical, seamless and 
knowable universe is abandoned since no practice engages more than a fraction of 
the universe.  
 
Different types of knowledge 
The distinction noted earlier between the Platonist and Aristotelian positions, 
now part of philosophy as the distinction between rationalism and empiricism, 
becomes useful once we interpret it to mean that humans might be able to know in 
two ways, one based on experience, the other based on the exercise of reason. In fact 
we are used to both types in our research. We employ the first kind of knowledge 
when we get data, and the second when we analyze it in a logically rigorous manner. 
We then define science as the process of generating new knowledge by interacting 
these two types, i.e. science does not comprise either data or hypotheses alone but 
arises from their interaction.  
The multitype epistemology which has had most impact on our field, a well as 
on Penrose (1955: 53), can be framed in terms of Polanyi’s (1962, 1967) distinction 
between explicit and implicit knowledge. While this reflects James’ distinction, 
Polanyi adds important nuances. Explicit knowledge is like ‘knowledge about’ in its 
abstractness, while tacit knowledge is associated with experience. But Polanyi’s 
notion of the tacit is richer than mere knowledge of acquaintance because it brings in 
a post-Freudian psychological dimension, reaching beyond conscious knowledge 
into sub- and preconscious modes of knowing. His intend was to criticized the

N. K. Kakabadse, A. Kouzmin and A. Kakabadse, From tacit knowledge to 
knowledge management: Leveraging invisible assets, Knowledge and Process 
Management, Vol. 8 (3), 2001, pp. 137-154 
 
Within competitive advantage considerations, knowledge has emerged as one of the 
more strategic, although invisible, assets for organization. Constructing, 
transforming and commodifying knowledge and information require new 
organizational understanding and newer capabilities of strategic management praxis. 
Part of this cognitive awareness is a deliberate organizational designing for the role 
of symbolic analysts. The paper considers neglected institutional and organizational 
dimensions to knowledge creation and knowledge conversion – it reviews the 
renewed importance of internal recruitment and socialization within institutions and 
details knowledge codification and application functions within knowledge-creating 
organizations. Knowledge management, as praxis, inevitably raises concerns about 
cognitive failure in leadership theory and praxis. 
 
Understanding the meaning of knowledge 
Tacit knowledge is based on the subjective insights, intuition and hunches and 
is deeply rooted in an individual’s actions and experience and ideals, values and 
emotions (Polanyi, 1966). In order to share, tacit knowledge needs to be converted 
in to words, numbers or pictures that can be understood by others (Polanyi, 1966). 
Tacit knowledge is deeply embedded personal beliefs, attitudes, values and 
experiences that give tacit knowledge its meaning (Popper, 1972). The terms tacit 
knowledge has not been formalized or made explicit (Zander and Zander, 1993), as 
well as to knowledge that cannot be formalized.  
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1955: 8) expand Polanyi’s (1966) tacit knowledge in a 
practical direction, segmenting it into two dimensions, technical and cognitive. 
Technical dimensions encompass craft and skills captured in concrete ‘know-how’ 
? exemplified by the master craftsman who is often unable to articulate what he or 
she knows. ‘Know-how’ cannot always be codified since it often has important tacit 
 88
Kant realized transcendental philosophy depended on this tenet: Apriority must 
be first and foremost established at the level of the invariant ontological structures of 
the mind and only secondarily in the logic-linguistic understanding of apriority, the 
latter serving only as illustration. 
In Kantian terms, consciousness is divided into faculties or powers, each with 
their own domains and independent functions. The two ‘stems’ of knowledge?
sensible intuition and categorical understanding?cannot exchange their functions. 
Yet they must cooperate for knowledge acquisition and this cooperation of the 
faculties is possible only on the basis of the independent, pre-logical, a priori 
conditions in each. Kant illustrated this: there is a class of experiential (synthetic) 
judgments that must be also a priori.  
For Kant, sensibility and the understanding are governed, ‘hard-wired’, by 
pure, pre-logical or ‘transcendental modes’ which are the conditions for the 
possibility of synthetic judgments a priori. Such ‘modes’ constituted the original 
sources in consciousness which makes the process of a transition or cooperation 
between faculties legitimate and makes synthetic judgments possible a priori.  
Kant famous quote: ‘not only are notions (concepts) without intuition (concept) 
empty, but intuitions without concepts are blind.’ Thus for Kant reality was captured 
in a two-way movement between sense content and conceptual understanding. John 
McDowell, in Lecture I of Mind and World, addresses the relationship between 
concepts and intuitions, and appeals to Kant’s famous passage, ‘Thoughts without 
content are empty and intuitions (sensible seeing) without concepts are blind,’ which 
Kant follows up with a lesser known but equally important corollary, ‘It is just as 
necessary to make our concepts sensible, as to make our intuitions intelligible.’  
McDowell claim, that experiences themselves, which he calls ‘receptivity in 
operation,’ are already equipped with conceptual content and represent a ‘joint 
involvement of receptivity and spontaneity ?in the understanding?,’ is consistent 
with Kant’s call above to make concepts sensible and intuition intelligible. Kant’s 
reflective-critical method shows self-consciousness at work in a self-analysis of the 
structures of sensibility. Kant’s central discovery was to find sensibility and the 
understanding to be two separate ‘stems’ of knowledge, each guided by its own 
independent laws, each requiring ‘critiques’ to be reunited in a transcendental 
 90
someone, and would be similar to each other, for him.  
Crucially, for Kant, it is not the fact that concept application, in general, 
involves spontaneity and combination on our part that leads to idealism, but the 
specific claim that experience is based on a priori concepts and principles. In the 
Transcendental Deduction, Kant tires to legitimate our right to use certain a priori 
concepts – the categories – and in fact, it is not his idealism but the need for 
concepts containing necessity and universality, Kant thinks, follows from the fact 
that combination cannot be given. Kant thinks that empirical concept application is 
based on subjective association, and that this creates a problem for the idea that 
empirical concepts alone can give us knowledge of objects – subjective association 
cannot be all there is. 
Kant thinks that empirical concept application requires us to associate things in 
ways that are determined by empirical imagination, which is entirely subjective, and 
that this creates a problem with the objectivity of our empirical knowledge, or with 
the idea that empirical knowledge is knowledge of an objective world. He says that 
for empirical knowledge to give us knowledge of objects. He argues for the need for 
an objective ground of synthesis, or objective affinity of the manifold, to ground the 
subjective association of empirical concept application, and says that without this, 
empirical concept application would not constitute knowledge of an objective world.

Over the past several decades, many scholars and experts have illuminated that the 
leading advantages of the economy in developed countries has become driven by 
technologies based upon knowledge and information production and distribution 
(Drucker, 1999; Davenport and Prusak, 1998; Gupta et al., 2004; Powell and 
Snellman, 2004). Unlike the past business which emphasized in land, capital and 
labor, the business today which emphasizes in fast-pace, high-tech and globalization 
requires the ability to capture, manage, and utilized information and knowledge in 
order to improve efficiency, better serve customers, manage the competition, and 
keep pace with relentless changes. Therefore, knowledge management (KM) has 
become an important discipline. This discipline deals with all aspects of knowledge 
within the context of the firms. It includes knowledge creation, codification, sharing, 
and the use of these activities to promote learning and innovation. 
“Knowledge management” can be defined as the collection of process that 
govern the creation, dissemination, and utilization of knowledge (Gupa, Sharma & 
Hsu, 2004; Powell and Snellman, 2004). A holistic view considers knowledge to be 
present in ideas, judgment, talents, roots causes, relationships, perspectives and 
concepts. Knowledge encompasses both tacit knowledge, which is in people’s head; 
and explicit knowledge, which is codified and expressed as information in databases, 
documents, etc. (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Prusak, 1997; Leonard and Sensiper, 
1998; Wong and Radcliffe, 2000; Brockmann, 2002). Many scholars consider 
implicit knowledge as one of the key components for successful enterprises or 
 94
develop an implicit exploratory analytic model by using the concept of a priori, 
which was proposed in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. The proposed IKEA model 
intends to facilitate organization or enterprise capturing and transforming the 
existing implicit knowledge into new explicit knowledge, or vice versa.  
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Definition of Tacit Knowledge 
Most of the researchers discoursed that implicit knowledge is one of the most 
important components in classifying the attributes of knowledge. Polanyi first 
coined the term ‘tacit knowledge’, in his book The Tacit Dimension (1966). In 
Polanyi’s work, tacit knowledge was defined as ‘the fact that we can know more 
than we can tell’. He regards tacit knowledge as something typically derived from 
experience and difficult to communicate (Wong and Radiliffe, 2000). Polanyi (1966) 
considers that tacit knowledge is primarily seen through an individual’s actions 
rather than through what the individual knows. Tacit knowing is such elusive and 
subjective awareness of individual that cannot be articulated in words. Implicitness, 
an other form of expressing knowing, does exist. It implies that one can articulate it 
but is unwilling to do that because of specific reasons under certain setting, such as 
intrinsic behavior in perception, cultural custom, or organizational style. 
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) expand Polanyi’s (1966) tacit knowledge in a 
practical direction, segmenting it into two dimensions, technical and cognitive. 
Technical dimensions encompass craft and skills captured in concrete ‘know-how’ 
 96
‘implicitness’ is one of the most important characteristics of tacit knowledge. Thus, 
implicit knowledge and tacit knowledge are used interchangeably in the following. 
2.2 The Previous Research on Knowledge Categorization 
A vast of studies has attempted to elucidate the essence of knowledge from the 
different aspects. For example, knowledge is stored in the individual brain or 
encoded in organizational processes, documents, products, services, facilities and 
systems. Knowledge is action, focuses innovation, pooled expertise, special 
relationships and alliances (Gupta et al., 2004). Knowledge is valued-added 
behavior and activities (Pfeffer and Sutton, 2000). Knowledge encompasses both 
tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Knowledge is not static; instead, it changes 
and evolves during the life of an organization (Skyrme, 2000, 2001). In order to 
facilitate the objective of knowledge management, researchers have attempted to 
divide knowledge into different categories. In particular, the community has 
abandoned the positivist view of knowledge as an objectified and monistic absolute 
truth, and has adopted a pluralistic epistemology, acknowledging that there are many 
forms or types of human knowledge (Stenmark, 2001; Gupta et al., 2004).  
Because of the complexity of knowledge comprehension, researchers employ 
different kinds of taxonomy to categorize the attributes of knowledge in order to 
answer the research purposes of their own. Based on the summary of the past studies 
present in Table 1, it is found that most of the researchers divided knowledge into 
several different categories according to the specific purpose of organization (i.e., 
 98
z Organization 
z Inter-organization 
and instructions, whereas tacit knowledge 
pertains more to understanding and expertise 
contained within people’s mind. 
The ontological dimension depicts knowledge 
that is shared with others in groups or larger 
aggregations of people across the organization. 
Matusik and Hill, 
1998 
(Connell, et al., 
2003) 
z Individual and collective 
knowledge 
z Private knowledge 
(organization-specific) and 
public knowledge (in the 
public domain) 
z Component and 
architectural knowledge 
Matusik and Hill identify distinctions between 
individual and collective knowledge, between 
private and public knowledge, and between 
component and architectural knowledge. 
Component knowledge relates to discrete aspects 
of an organization’s operations and may be held 
individually or collectively. It may have public 
and private elements. Architectural knowledge 
relates to organization-wide routines for 
coordinating components, and it covers the whole 
organization, it is held collectively. Architectural 
knowledge is tacit, private, and more valuable 
than component knowledge. 
Wong and 
Radgliffe, 2000 
 
Knowledge schema 
z Linguistic knowledge 
z Formal knowledge 
z Professional knowledge 
z Societal knowledge 
z Know-x 
Wong and Radgliffe propose a knowledge 
schema, which consists of five different 
categories. These categorizations are not 
mutually exclusive; however, they are distinct. 
Linguistic knowledge is essential for 
communication. 
Formal knowledge is acquired and learned in the 
classroom, library or laboratory. 
Professional knowledge is required when 
carrying out the duty of a particular position in an 
organization. 
Societal knowledge is acquired partly on the job 
and partly from life experience, augmented by 
formal knowledge. 
The knowledge of what information/knowledge 
to be used where and when, why the particular 
information/knowledge is used and how it can be 
applied to achieve the design objectives is 
referred to as ‘know-x’. 
 100
Nandhakumar, 2002; Brockmann and Anthony, 2002; Wong and Radgliffe, 2000). 
They all considered that tacit knowledge is a key factor of a successful knowledge 
management for organizations or enterprises. Some models explicated a particular 
stage in the process of knowledge management, such as detecting implicit 
knowledge, codifying, transferring and creating knowledge (Schulz and Jobe, 2001; 
Nissen, 2002; Armbrecht et al., 2001; Cornell et al, 2003).

Codification strategies involve the transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit 
knowledge in order to facilitate flows of organizational knowledge. Tacitness 
strategies keep organizational knowledge tacit in order to prevent flows of 
knowledge to competitors. Focused knowledge management strategies regulate 
knowledge flows by controlling the degree to which knowledge is encoded informs 
that match the information intensity and ambiguity of their knowledge. Unfocused 
knowledge management strategies attempt to regulate knowledge flows by 
controlling the overall of codification of knowledge without special consideration of 
the capabilities of specific forms of codification. According to the above definitions, 
Schulz and Jobe rasied four hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: subunits with high levels of 
codification of knowledge experience stronger performance that subunits with low 
levels of codification. Hypothesis 2: subunits with high levels of tacitness of 
knowledge experience stronger performance than subunits with low levels of 
tacitness. Hypothesis 3: subunits with a focused approach to knowledge 
management have higher performance than subunits with an unfocused approach. 
Hypothesis 4: subunits with a matched codification focus have higher performance 
than subunits with an unmatched codification focus.  
The empirical analyses suggest that a focused approach to organizational 
knowledge management enhances performance, while unfocused approaches do not. 
They suggest that the most important benefit of focused approaches to codification 
stems from the differential ability of codification forms to facilitate knowledge flows. 
They also suggest that knowledge flows are most facilitated when technical 
knowledge is codified in numbers and codes, marketing and sales knowledge is 
codified in text and language based forms, and when strategic knowledge regarding 
competitors is encoded in objects and people. The authors propose a nested 
contingency model of knowledge management based on the results of this study. 
They believe that a nested contingency model is most appropriate for understanding 
 104
This research confirms that there are different organizational members with different 
knowledge, expertise and positions involved in the strategy formation process. The 
conceptual model proposed by Schwarz and Nandhakumar provides the 
development of strategic idea in organization, which offering an approach in 
observing the process of how a raw idea becoming into a mature idea. However, in 
the development of strategic idea, it lacks of analyzing the typologies of knowledge, 
the categories of knowledge cannot be conducted. It also lacks of observing how 
external environment have an influence in developing strategic idea. In each step, it 
is not easy to measure the performance quality of every task. It did not consider 
other important factors, which probably influence the performance of developing a 
strategic idea, such as organizational culture, re-engineering, and innovation ability, 
etc. This study presents a contribution to the empirical studies in the field, which 
lacks such longitudinal field study. 
Brockmann and Anthony (2002) employed a process model in explaining 
knowledge in the context of strategic decision making. They explained the 
definitions of both tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge from the aspects of their 
natures, and illustrated the levels of knowledge associated with ontology. They 
considered that tacit knowledge is not easily recognized or acknowledge, but it can 
be a key factor in enhancing the quality of strategic decisions made by the top 
management. Brockmann and Anthony made a proposition that the influence of 
managers’ tacit knowledge on the quality of their strategic decisions will be 
moderated by their application of the methods (self-reflection, incubation, 
reinforcement, and mental imagery) necessary to access and apply their tacit 
knowledge. In this study, Brockmann and Anthony did not consider the issue of how 
to transform tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. They contended that there are 
 106
incorporating the third dimension- knowledge management life cycle. Because the 
concept of flow is inherently dynamic, Nissen et al. extend this framework by 
incorporating time as the fourth dimension.  
The studies present above acknowledged that it still exists a gap for managing 
implicit knowledge. It is due to the analytic models are not specifically proposed for 
analyzing the implicit knowledge. The goal of codifying knowledge is to ‘convert 
knowledge into accessible and applicable formats’ (Davenport and Prusak, 2000). 
However, the most difficult and challenging area is to process the format of implicit 
knowledge, and to codify this kind of knowledge on paper or in database (Gupta et 
al., 2002). 
3. Development of IKEA Model 
In developing the conceptual framework for IKEA model, a series of stages is 
introduced, which include the categorization of implicit knowledge and the 
procedure of implicit knowledge development. The work of The Critique of Pure 
Reason, published by the well-known philosopher-Immanuel Kant in 1781, will be 
used in developing the model. It is not the intention of this study to resolve the 
philosophy problem. However, the Kant’s a priori do provides us a valuable light in 
investigating implicit knowledge from the previous studies. We attempt to use the 
concept of a priori to elucidate the implicit knowledge. 
3.1 The Account of Kant’s a Priori 
 108
about them. Kant considers that sensibility and understanding are the fundamental of 
empirical knowledge, and he discourses the principles of sensibility and a priori, 
Therefore, Kant considered that sensibility and concept are the two origin 
stems of human knowledge. He cognized the main problem of metaphysics and any 
science is derived from not only explaining the object itself why is necessary and 
universal, but also including the possibility of analyzing more knowledge from the 
perceived object. Kant argued that knowledge depends on a priori judgment to meet 
these propositions because the judgment which is independent from the experience 
accidental can be necessary and synthetic at the same time.  
From the beginning of his great work, the critique of pure reason, Kant reveals 
that the first product of our understanding in the cosmology knowledge is experience. 
However, this experience as the individual judgment can not provide us universal 
and necessary knowledge effectively. Because only based on the experience, we can 
not derive the conclusion that the same experience will positively happen afterward. 
Kant argued that the universal and necessary knowledge can not dependent on 
experience, and the knowledge itself should be decided and true. This kind of 
knowledge is entitled a priori knowledge by Kant, and he employed this concept to 
call the knowledge which is not obtained from experience and pure reason. Kant 
argued that we actually possessed a priori knowledge which provides a network to 
access our knowledge.

The ‘Transcendental Aesthetic’ is the study of space and time as a priori forms 
of perception. The ‘Transcendental Aesthetic’ deals with sensibility and its pure 
forms, and the ‘Transcendental Logic’ deals with the operations of the understanding 
and judgment as well as both the spurious and the legitimate activities of theoretical 
reason. 
Based on the account of cognition a priori, Kant then explains the distinction 
between ‘General Logic’ and ‘Transcendental Logic’ – the former being the basic 
science of the forms of thought regardless of its object, and the latter being the 
science of the basic forms for the thought of objects. Kant then splits the 
‘Transcendental Logic’ into two main divisions, the ‘Transcendental Analytic’ and 
the ‘Transcendental Dialectic’. (Guyer and Wood, 2000)  
‘Transcendental Analytic’ is the study of the means by which the mind 
categories data from the sensory manifold. ‘Transcendental Analytic’ considers the 
understanding as the source of a priori concepts that yield a priori cognitions in 
conjunction with the forms of intuitions already analyzed. Kant considers that we 
can trace back all actions of the understanding, so that the understanding in general 
can be represented as a faculty for judging. For according to what has been said 
above it is a faculty for thinking. Thinking is cognition through concepts. Concepts, 
as predicates of possible judgments, are related to some representation of a still 
undetermined object. The functions of the understanding can therefore all be found 
 112
general, or the forms for any particular concepts of object, and in conjunction with 
the a priori forms of intuition are the basis of all synthetic a priori cognition. 
Kant considers that pure concepts of the understanding pertain to objects a 
priori is basically identical with the concepts ‘categories’ advocated by Aristotle. 
Kant argues that if we abstract all content of a judgment in general, and attend only 
to mere form of the understanding in it, we find that the function of thinking in the 
concept can be brought under four categories. Kant calls the contribution of the 
mind a ‘category’. He distinguishes four groups of categories by which the contents 
of experience are ordered: quantity, quality, relation, and modality (see Table 4).

“Transcendental Dialectic” is the study of the fallacious attributions of 
objective reality to the perception by the mind of external objects. “Transcendental 
Dialectic,” investigates the faculty of reason, in the first instance as a source of 
illusory arguments and metaphysical pseudo-sciences, although in the end also as 
 114
merely revealed by subtle philosophical analysis but unavoidably manifest 
themselves in the form of actual contradictions each side of which seems naturally 
plausible. Kant argues that unless we accept the transcendental idealist. Distinction 
between appearances and things in themselves, we will be committed to accepting 
mutually incompatible arguments, arguments both that there must be a first 
beginning of the world in time and that there cannot be, there must be limits to the 
world in space and there cannot be (the two halves of the first antinomy), both that 
there must be simple substance and that there cannot be (the second antinomy), both 
that there must be at least one first or uncaused cause and that there cannot be (the 
third antinomy). And there must be a being whose necessary existence is the ground 
of all contingent beings and that there can be no necessary being (the fourth 
antinomy).
