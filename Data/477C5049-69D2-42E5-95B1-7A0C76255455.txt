Literature Review
In the representative papers on the characteristics of micaceous sands, e.g. Gilboy 1928;
McCarthy and Leonards 1963; Santamarina and Cho 2004, bulky or round non-mica sand
particles were considered. These shapes are very different from the platy particles in the
micaceous sands along the Draw-Shui river in Taiwan. Therefore, the findings and conclusions
presented in these papers may not be directly used for the platy sands. Other significant papers
are listed in the reference section of this report. Lade (1998) reported that the maximum void
ratio and the minimum void ratio of sands are functions of their non-plastic fine content. They
both decrease with increasing the fine content until 20%~30% and then increase with increasing
the fine content. However, possible effects of particle shape are not studied. In the book of
Fundamentals of Soil Behavior by Mitchell (1993), the information on effects of particle shape is
rather limited. Thus, it is of great interest for this study to collect a large amount of data so as to
better understand the behavior of micaceous sands.
Methodologies
As this study intended to collect data for evaluation of properties of micaceous sands,
laboratory tests on varieties of samples of micaceous sands were conducted. Micaceous sand
samples were obtained either from the field or in the laboratory. Commercial muscovites
samples were orderd and used in the laboratory to prepare samples of different mica contents and
types. Compression of samples was measured with the conventional oedometer, the test tank,
and the direct shear setup. The testing program was designed in such a way that the effects of
both mica content and type of mica on the compression behavior can be clearly shown. Digital
microscope was used to take magnified images of the sand particles so that sand fabric and
paticle shape can be easily seen, for better evaluation of the compression behaviors.
For the purpose of laboratory tests, samples of Draw-Shui river sand were taken during field
trips, in which the Quick Draw tensiometers were used to measure the suction of sands. For a
suction value of zero, the sand is completely or nearly saturated. It is thus not suitable for
excavation. In several occasions, suction values as high as 18 kPa were measured at some
locations in the field so that shallow excavations for sand sampling and sand fabric observations
were then conducted at the spots. It was found during the field trips that sand particles are
coarser in the top of the alluvial fan and are finer in the tail of the fan, and all of them are mainly
platy. The platy particles in the sand sample are dark in color, while there are minor amount of
white brown particles in subangular shape in the sand sample. Fig. ?? shows the photo taken on
the surface of shallow excavation. It can be seen from Fig. ?? that the platy particles are
oriented randomly without a preferred direction. The orientation of the platy sand particles
changed after loading from the ground surface and became more parallel with the horizontal
plane.
The photos shown below present some of the research works conducted during this study.

1. Particle size distribution of the sands tested
Major materials used in this study include Mai-Liao sand, Draw-Shui river sand, Muscovite
#40, Muscovite #325, and Ottawa sand. Fig. 1-2 show the particle size distribution curves of
these materials, from which it can be seen that the Ottawa sand and the Muscovite #40 are
coarse-grained materials, the Mai-Liao sand and Draw-Shui river sand are a bit finer, and the
Muscovite #325 is the finest material.

2. Static loading tests with the test tank
A series of model tests with a test tank of 600-mm in diameter were carried out to study the
loading versus settlement relationships of shallow foundations. Mai-Liao sand specimens of
different relative densities were prepared by pluviation in dry condition. For example, a loading

The curves in Figs. 3-4 can be used for evaluation of the ultimate bearing capacity and the
results are plotted in Fig. 5 for a comparison with the same type of data in the literature (Vesic et
al. 1963). It is apparent from Fig. 5 that the data of Mai-Liao sand fit quite well with the
existing data. As both sands are micaceous but the Mai-Liao sand is mainly platy and the sand
in Vesic et al. (1963) is mainly subaugular, it may be concluded particle shape does not play an
important role in the compression behavior of micaceous sands. Alternatively, it may be
concluded that it is the mica in the sand that controls the compression behavior of micaceous
sands. Ottawa sand will be tested in the test tank to verify the above conclusion. In order to
evaluate sand particles movement underneath the loading plate, a soft paper tissue was placed
horizontally underneath the loading plate at a depth of 75 mm. The paper tissue can be easily
torn up as a result of uneven settlement across it. The paper tissue was excavated after the
loading test. It is estimated from the depth and the torn area of the paper tissue that the side of a

4. Direct shear tests
In order to evaluate the effect of mica content and type on the friction angle of micaceous
sands, several series of drained direct shear tests were performed using laboratory prepared
samples. In these tests, Mai-Liao sand, Ottawa sand, Muscovite #40, and Muscovite #325
samples were used. The mica content of the prepared specimens varied from 0% to 100%.
Friction angle of pure mica was determined as the baseline value for comparison purposes. The
specimen in the direct shear box was loaded to a specified normal stress before shearing to failure.
Five different normal stresses were specified for five different specimens per mixture, so as to
define the failure envelope. Both dry and saturated conditions were considered in the test series.
As the specimens were freshly prepared, the cohesion intercept should be zero or very small.
The test results include directly measured displacements and shearing resistances and analyzed
friction angles. It is clear from the test results that both mica content and mica type have strong

ABSTRACT
Micaceous sand has been found in the southwest coastal areas of
Taiwan, but geotechnical properties of such sand have not been
established. This paper presents the results of an investigation on both
compressibility and shear strength of micaceous sand samples. Both
natural micaceous sand and micaceous sand mixtures were prepared for
laboratory tests. The conventional oedometer was used to measure
compressibility and the direct shear apparatus was used to measure
shear strength. Of particular interest is the time-dependent
compressibility of micaceous sand. Both saturated and dry sand
samples were used for the oedometer tests. The shear strength was
measured on dry sand samples.
KEY WORDS: Sand; mica; compressibility; shear strength.
INTRODUCTION
This paper presents the results of a laboratory testing program on both
natural micaceous sand and laboratory prepared micaceous sand
mixtures. The natural micaceous sand samples were taken from a mega
coastal reclamation site in Mai-Liao, Taiwan. The reclaimed land has
been open to use for industrial purposes, but excessive settlement of
some important structures on the reclaimed land has been observed out
of expectation. The location of the reclaimed land is at the seaward
fringe of a wide alluvial fan of a major river. Seasonal flood and yearly
occurring typhoon caused severe erosion problems in the upstream of
the river, where fragments of metamorphic rocks containing mica were
transported and broken apart in the river until resting in the alluvial fan.
Limited studies have indicated the presence of mica (muscovite) in this
alluvial sand deposit. Recent investigation by the author found that the
Mai-Liao micaceous sand samples contained about 10% of Muscovite
by weight. In view of the lack of data on the geotechnical properties of
the Mai-Liao micaceous sand, both oedometer and direct shear
apparatus were used in this study to investigate its compressibility and
shear strength characteristics. In addition, laboratory prepared mixtures
of commercial mica and Mai-Liao sand samples were also tested to
investigate the relationships between mica content and compressibility
and shear strength of mica-sand mixtures. Results of this study on local
micaceous sands will add additional data to the literature (e.g. Gilboy,
1928; Harris, 1984)
TEST PROGRAM
The natural Mai-Liao sand samples used contain about 6% of fines,
with a uniformity coefficient of 2.5 and an average grain size of 0.17
mm. Scanning electron microphotographs (SEM) of the Mia-Liao sand
samples show that most of the particles are platy, e.g. as shown in Fig.
1. It seems from these SEM (taken at low magnification ratio) that the
mica constituents in the natural Mai-Liao sand are probably rather
small, since in these SEM the typical scaling shape of mica particles are
absent.
Fig. 1 SEM microphotograph of Mai-Liao sand
Commercially available coarse muscovites (< #40 sieve) and fine
muscovites (< #325 sieve) were used to study the effect, if any, of size
and amount of mica particle on compressibility and shear strength of
micaceous sand mixtures. The coarse muscovite sample has a

ratios of the dry Mai-Liao sand, 30% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand,
and 30% #40 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand under a small consolidation
pressure 13.7 kPa are about 1.0, 1.6, and 2.0, respectively. The
compression indices of these sands are indicated in Fig. 5. It is clear
from Fig. 5 that the compressibility of the 30% Muscovite-Mai-Liao
sands is much higher than that of the natural Mai-Liao sand. The
compression index of the 30% #40 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand is slightly
greater than that of the 30% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand. It can
also be seen that the slope of the loge curves for Muscovite-Mai-
Liao sands increases initially and then becomes nearly a constant. In
contrast, the slope of the loge curves for natural Mai-Liao sand
continuously increases with consolidation pressure. The rebound of the
30% Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand specimens is also much higher than that
of the natural Mai-Liao sand. This may not be too surprising in view of
a relatively high content of Muscovite in the specimen.

Fig. 6 Consolidation pressure versus void ratio relationships of
saturated Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand
For saturated oedometer specimens, it can be seen from Fig. 6 that the
void ratios of the Mai-Liao sand, 15% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand,
and 20% #40 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand under a small consolidation
pressure 27.4 kPa are about 1.0, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively. The
compression indices of these sands are indicated in Fig. 6. It is clear
from Fig. 6 that the compressibility of the Muscovite-Mai-Liao sands is
also higher than that of the natural Mai-Liao sand. The compression
index of the 20% #40 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand is clearly greater than
that of the 15% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand. The rebound of the
Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand specimens is much higher than that of the
natural Mai-Liao sand, which is apparently a result of a relatively high
Muscovite content in the specimen. It may be noted that the Muscovite
contents of the saturated samples are less than that of the dry samples,
so that the compressibility of saturated samples are smaller than that of
dry samples. It appears from Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 that the saturated Mai-
Liao sand is slightly more compressible than the dry Mai-Liao sand,
partly due to a slightly higher initial void ratio for the saturated sample.
Relationships between cCC and Mica Content
The ratio of secondary compression index and compression
index, cCC , shows an important time-dependent compressibility
property of natural soils. Data of cCC has been found a constant for
any soil (e.g. Terzaghi et al., 1996). For granular soils, cCC values
range from 0.01 to 0.03. For inorganic clays, cCC values range from
0.03 to 0.05. For organic soils and peat, cCC values range from 0.05
to 0.07. However, cCC data for high Muscovite content granular soils
are absent. Data obtained during this study are shown in Fig. 7. It
should be noted again that the natural Mai-Liao sand contains about
10% Muscovite. The cCC values for dry Mai-Liao sand are about
0.02 and for saturated Mai-Liao sand are slightly varied between 0.02
and 0.03. These fall within the empirical 0.01 to 0.03 range for
granular soils. The effect of water on time-dependent compressibility
appears to have resulted in the slightly higher cCC values. For Mai-
Liao sand with 30% Muscovite added, it can be seen from Fig. 7 that
the cCC ratio increases with increasing cC , i.e. consolidation pressure.
For the 30% #40 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand, the cCC values vary
gradually from about 0.005 to 0.02. For the 30% #325 Muscovite-Mai-
Liao sand, the relationship between C and cC is totally out of
expectation. The last four data points show a nearly constant cC value
of 0.4, but the corresponding C values keep increasing. This observed
variable cCC behavior of Muscovite-Mai-Liao sands is under further
investigation.

For preparing the mica-sand samples, natural Mai-Liao sand was used.
Mica contents selected in preparing the mica-sand mixtures varied from
5% to 30% to cover the range of possible mica contents in most natural
sands. Dry specimens were air-pluviated into the oedometer ring and
the direct shear box. Saturated oedometer specimens were prepared by
adding water to the dry specimens from the bottom porous stone. For
the oedometer tests, a Wykeham Farrance front loading setup was used.
The compression of the incremental loading oedometer specimen was
measured with a Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT)
displacement transducer and a data acquisition system. For each
loading increment, compression data were recorded at a preset series of
times to observe time-dependent compression behavior. For the direct
shear tests, a conventional setup with a data acquisition system was
used. Each direct shear specimen was sheared under one consolidation
pressure only.
TEST RESULTS
Results of an oedometer test include time versus compression curve and
consolidation pressure versus void ratio curve. Pertinent
compressibility parameters such as compression index cC and
secondary compression index C can be evaluated from these curves.
The ratio of C and cC is an important time-dependent compressibility
parameter of soil (Terzaghi et al., 1996). Results of a direct shear test
include shear displacement versus shear stress curve, shear
displacement versus compression curve, and consolidation stress versus
peak shear strength relationship. Shear strength parameters in terms of
cohesion intercept and angle of internal friction can be evaluated from
the consolidation pressure versus shear strength relationship. Some of
the typical results of the tests are shown below.
Time versus Compression Curves
Figure 3 and Fig. 4 show typical time versus compression curves
obtained from the oedometer tests. As dry specimens were tested, there
is immediate compression occurred due to loading increment, followed
by continuous compression with time. It can be seen from these curves
that each loading increment was sustained for at least 10 minutes for at
least three logarithmic cycles of time. The scaling of both x-axis and y-
axis in Figs. 3 and 4 are the same to facilitate a direct comparison of the
curves between two tests. A dramatic difference between the curves is
that the immediate compression of the 30% Muscovite #325-Mai-Liao
sand mixture is much greater than that of the natural Mai-Liao sand
sample. However, the shape of these curves is fairly linear. The two
curves of 30% Muscovite #325-Mai-Liao sand mixture under 876.8 and
1753.6 kPa loadings show large amount of compression between two
initial data points. It simply indicates a slower time-rate of
compression.

Consolidation Pressure versus Void Ratio Curves
The compression at 1 minute on each curve shown in Figs. 3 and 4 can
be used to calculate a corresponding void ratio. Similar calculations
can be made for unloadings. Pairs of the calculated void ratio and the
associated consolidation pressure can be used to plot loge curves,
as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for dry specimens and saturated
specimens, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the initial void

Shear Displacement versus Shear Force Curves
Figure 8 shows the measured shear displacement versus shear force
relationships of dry natural Mai-Liao sand under effective normal
stresses of 9, 33, 79, 169, and 350 kPa. Fig. 9 shows the same type of
data of dry 30% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand. All of these curves
show that maximum shear force is achieved after large shear
displacement. This is expected since the direct shear specimen is
freshly prepared in loose condition. The maximum shear force is
divided by the area of the specimen to get a corresponding shear stress
at failure. The diameter of the specimen is 63.5 mm.

CONCLUSIONS
Several conclusions may be made from the data and discussion
presented in previous paragraphs. By adding commercial Muscovites
to the natural Mai-Liao sand, the compressibility is increased and the
shear strength is reduced. The cCC ratio of the Muscovite-Mai-Liao
sand starts with values less than 0.01 and increases or remains constant
with increasing consolidation pressure. This behavior is likely to be
related to the size and shape of the platy particle of Mai-Liao sand and
the flaky particle of Muscovites. The angle of internal friction of the
natural Mai-Liao sand is reduced by 4 as result of adding 30% #325
Muscovite. It is judged from the results of this study that the mica
content, if any, of natural sand does affect its compressibility and shear
strength.

Figure 10 shows relationships between the effective normal stress and
the shear stress at failure for the natural Mai-Liao sand, the pure #325
Muscovite, and the 30% #325 Muscovite-Mai-Liao sand. Linear
regression on the whole range of each relationship is carried out to
determine the value of angle of internal friction, as indicated in the
figure. Data presented in Fig. 10 show a range of the angle of internal
friction from 22 to 31 , with a smaller value for pure #325 Muscovite
and a higher value for natural Mai-Liao sand. The effect of adding
30% #325 Muscovite to the natural Mai-Liao sand is reducing the angle
of internal friction by 4 .
