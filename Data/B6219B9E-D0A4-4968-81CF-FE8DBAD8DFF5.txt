Abstract
To reduce positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography
(CT) misalignments and standardized uptake value (SUV) errors, cine average
CT (CACT) has been proposed to replace helical CT (HCT) for attenuation
correction (AC). A new method using interpolated average CT (IACT) for
AC is introduced to further reduce radiation dose with similar image quality.
Six patients were recruited in this study. The end-inspiration and -expiration
phases from cine CT were used as the two original phases. Deformable image
registration was used to generate the interpolated phases. The IACT was
calculated by averaging the original and interpolated phases. The PET images
were then reconstructed with AC using CACT, HCT and IACT, respectively.
Their misalignments were compared by visual assessment, mutual information,
correlation coefficient and SUV. The doses from different CT maps were
analyzed. The misalignments were reduced for CACT and IACT as compared
to HCT. The maximum SUV difference between the use of IACT and CACT
was ∼3%, and it was ∼20% between the use of HCT and CACT. The estimated
dose for IACT was 0.38 mSv. The radiation dose using IACT could be reduced
by 85% compared to the use of CACT. IACT is a good low-dose approximation
of CACT for AC.

anterior–posterior and inferior–superior displacements for each voxel, respectively. The OFM
calculation equation is as follows:
v(n+1) = v(n) + ∇f
(
∇f · v(n) + ∂f
∂t
α2 + ‖∇f ‖2
)
, (1)
where n is the number of iterations, v(n) is the average velocity driven from the surrounding
voxels, f is the image intensity, and α is the weighting factor whose value is empirically set
at 5 for the OFM in CT (Huang et al 2010, Zhang et al 2008).
Interpolated average CT
For IACT calculated from 2 original phases + 11 interpolated phases (IACT2o11i), two extreme
phases in cine CT, i.e. normal end-inspiration and -expiration, are used to generate the motion
maps via the OFM. The total motion range for each voxel in the forward motion map is equally
spaced into six intervals, resulting in five sets of interpolated CT images as the mid-phases
from inspiration to expiration. Similarly, the backward motion map is used to calculate the
five mid-phases from expiration to inspiration (figure 1). The ten interpolated phases together
with the two original phases, plus the next inhalation compose a complete respiratory cycle.
These 13 phases are averaged to generate the IACT2o11i.
To study the reliability of the proposed IACT technique, different numbers of original
phases in the cine CT are used in calculating IACT. Other configurations of the IACTs include
4 original phases + 9 interpolated phases (IACT4o9i), 6 original phases + 7 interpolated phases
(IACT6o7i), and 8 original phases + 5 interpolated phases (IACT8o5i).

Radiation dose
Radiation dose was expressed using the volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) in Gy, and effective
dose in mSv. The dose–length product is defined as the CTDIvol multiplied by the scan
length, and is an indicator of the integrated radiation dose of an entire CT examination. An
approximation of the effective dose was obtained by multiplying the dose–length product by
a conversion factor, k (equal to 0.017 mSv mGy−1 cm−1) (ICRP 2007).
Results
The MI and CC results showed that as the number of original phases in IACT increases,
IACT and CACT become more relevant, while IACT2o11i performs better than ACT (figure 2).
Figure 3 shows the sample reconstructed images of HCT, CACT and IACT2o11i, their associated
PET images and the fused PET/CT images. The only noticeable difference between CACT
and IACT2o11i is the higher noise level in IACT2o11i as compared to CACT. This is expected
as CACT is an average of all 13 original phases from cine CT, while IACT2o11i uses only
2 original phases. On the other hand, PET images using HCT for AC demonstrate noticeable
artifacts in the diaphragm region. The SUV analysis for HCT, CACT, different IACTs and
ACT is shown in figure 4. For tumor nos 1 through 7, the difference from the one using CACT
is smallest when IACT8o5i is used, and it is largest when HCT is used. However, even with
IACT2o11i where the difference is the largest among all IACT configurations, it is 3% as
compared to CACT, while the difference was 10% with the maximum difference of ∼20%,
between the use of HCT and CACT, consistent with the reported values (Pan et al 2005). The
results of ACT are generally inferior to those of IACT2o11i except for tumor no 4.
The effective radiation doses (and CTDIvol) from the CT scans are listed in table 1. The
higher dose from HCT, 5.28 mSv (11.18 mGy), is due to the clinical setting of smart mA.
In cine CT, the current is set at 10 mA; thus the effective dose is 2.46 mSv (5.17 mGy). If
the two original phases in the IACT2o11i are replaced by two breath-hold CT scans with the
same tube current as of cine CT, the effective dose would be 0.38 mSv (0.79 mGy), i.e. an
85% reduction from cine CT and a 93% reduction from HCT. In addition, the typical effective

generally outperforms ACT, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method. The little
difference in the SUV for PET using IACT and CACT for AC also indicates that IACT is a good
approximation of CACT, with the advantage of less radiation dose. For gated PET studies,
other approaches for AC are proposed. For example, respiratory gated CT corresponding to the
gated PET frames are acquired for phase-dependent AC. Other methods include transforming a
single CT image to match the associated PET frames through tracking the diaphragm motions
in PET (McQuaid et al 2009). These methods require manual segmentation of the diaphragm
and their accuracy highly depends on the motion model.
The motion amplitude may impact the accuracy of the motion maps. Zhong et al (2010)
showed that the average error in deformable image registration in thoracic regions was around
0.7 mm for a diaphragm motion of 2.6 cm. This accuracy is sufficient for PET AC as PET
resolution is much coarser.
The selected lesions located in diversified thoracic regions are representative of general
clinical scenarios. Chi et al (2008) reported that out of 216 lung cancer patients, 68% had
mis-registration and only 10% had an SUV change of >25% at the tumor location. Four out
of seven lesions in our study showed >10% SUV difference between the use of CACT and
HCT, with the maximum SUV difference of ∼20% for the esophageal lesion which is closest
to the diaphragm among all cases.
The drawback of the very low dose setting (10 mA) in both CACT and IACT methods
is the increased noise in the CT images. Noisy AC data can introduce noise into the PET
emission images. As shown in figure 3(B), the emission data for CACT and IACT appear
noisier than the images corrected with HCT data because of the higher quantum noise in the
AC data in CACT and IACT. If the same signal-to-noise ratio in the emission images of the
HCT method is desired, the current setting in CACT and IACT has to be the same as that
