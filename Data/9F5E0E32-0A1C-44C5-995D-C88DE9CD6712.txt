Ⅰ. Introduction 
Dielectric resonators are the prime 
components in various communication systems 
at microwave frequency. In such applications, 
the materials fulfill these requirements, such as 
high relative permittivity, rε  (resonator’s 
size
rε
1∝ ); high quality factor, Q; 
temperature stability of the dielectric properties; 
and low thermal expansion coefficient. The 
Ba( 'B 1/3 "B 2/3)O3-type ( 'B = Mg +2 , Zn+2; "B  
= Nb +5, Ta+5) complex perovskite compound 
shows ordering structure in B-site cations and 
exhibits a very low dielectric loss at microwave 
frequency.1-3 The high cost of Ta-based 
complex perovskite ceramics makes it less 
cost-effective for many applications. Therefore, 
investigations on the Nb2O5-based complex 
perovskite ceramics have been increased. 
The low level substitution of appropriate 
cations on either the A-site (e.g.La3+) or B-site 
(e.g.Zr4+) sublattice will alter the B-site 
ordering to a cubic “1:1” ordered structure. It 
indicates that the cation substitution promotes a 
transformation from a 1:2 to a 1:1 ordered 
structure and causes the variation in dielectric 
properties.  Two kinds of model are suggested 
to explain the formation of 1:1 ordering from 
previous investigations.4-8 The stabilization of a 
1:1 ordered cation arrangement was interpreted 
by the space-charge model in the A-site (e.g. 
La3+)-substituted complex perovskite 
compound. In this model, the composition of a 
1:1ordered region is represented by

xx OBBLaA , and the charge 
imbalance is compensated by an equal and 
oppositely charged B5+-rich disordered matrix. 
The evidence of the space-charge model has 
come from the increase in the stability and the 
size of the 1:1 ordered domain with increasing 
lanthanum substitution because of the reduction 
of charge imbalance. For the B-site (e.g. Zr4+) 
substituted 1:2 perovskite compounds, the 1:1 
ordering occurs by the random-site model for a 
Ba( 'B 1/3 "B 2/3)O3-type structure. In this model, 
the "B  sites are occupied by B5+, and the 'B  
site contains a random distribution of B2+, Zr4+, 
and remaining B5+ cations. The 1:1 ordered 
phase is charge balance, and its solid solution 
can be represented 
by 32/1

− . The 
composition of the ordered domain is the same 
as that of the disorder matrix; thus, overall 
charge neutrality is maintained within the 
ordered domain. 
 Akbas et al.9 described that the 1:2 
ordered structure has a limited stability in the 
solid solution of Ba1-xLax(Zn(1+x)/3Nb(2-x)/3)O3. 
However, the formation of a 1:1 ordered 
structure is not consistent with the above 
space-charge model but rather with the 
random-site structure in their investigation. 
They suggest that it is possible to form the 'B  
random-site 1:1 ordered phase with the formula 
of Ba1-xLax{[Zn(2+2x)/3Nb(1-2x)/3]1/2[Nb]1/2}O3. 
However, the relation between structural 
transition and dielectric properties was not 
studied in the above investigation. 
 In commercial applications, the resonant 
frequency of the filters must not depend 
strongly on the temperature. The temperature 
coefficient of the resonant frequency (τf) shall 
be less than 10 ppm° C-1 for microwave 
ceramics. The τf is usually predicted by the 
empirical method; only a few studies have 
attempted to associate it with an intrinsic, 
structure-related parameter. Onoda et al.10 
showed that by substituting Sr for Ba in the 
BaxSr1-x(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 solid solution caused the 
change of τf which was not monotonous. They 
suggested that the anomaly was attributed to an 
increase in the degree of ordering between Zn 
and Nb cations with increasing Sr 
concentration. Meanwhile, Cho et al.11 used the 
IR spectra and XRD analysis to study the 
short-range ordering, and they suggested that 
the cation ordering should be a critical factor 
which could determine the sign of τf. 
However, the τf is related to the temperature 
coefficient of relative permittivity (τε) 
αττ ε −−= 21f  
where α is the thermal expansion coefficient. 
The τf is directly influenced by τε, since the 
magnitude of α is generally constant and 
insignificant compared to that of τε.

Ⅲ. Results 
The XRD patterns of the 
Ba1-xLax[Zn(1+x)/3Nb(2-x)/3]O3 composition 
showed that the single phase of perovskites 
could be formed when 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6, as shown in 
Fig. 1. Furthermore, more lanthanum 
substitution caused the presence of ZnO at x = 
0.8, and the lanthanum end-member 
composition, La(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3, failed to 
produce a perovskite phase. It showed a 
two-phase mixture of LaNbO4 and ZnO for the 
composition of La(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3.

substitution (x). 
Figure 2 shows the selected-area 
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns from the 
grains in the sample, where x = 0. The patterns 
were indexed based on the simple cubic 
perovskite unit cell. The superlattice reflections 
of 1:2 ordering are characterized by the 
presence of ±⅓(111)c type reflections (where c 
denotes a pseudocubic setting), as indicated by 
arrowheads in Fig.2. The presence of these 
spots indicates a tripling of the unit cell and the 
formation of a 1:2 ordered domain structure.

Figure 3 (a)(b) shows the presence of antiphase 
boundary (APBs) in the sample with the 
composition of x = 0 by which many 1:2 
chemical ordering domains are separated from 
each other. The APBs were observed because 
of the influence of chemical ordering regions, 
which had nucleated out of phase. The APBs 
are easily distinguished because that they do 
not lie on a specific set of crystallographic 
planes, whereas the ferroelastic domains have 
domain walls parallel to  crystallographic 
planes.21 No typical wedge-shaped ferroelastic 
domains were observed in the sample, where x 
= 0. The HRTEM image of the pure BZN phase 
with the composition of x = 0 showed that 
modulations with a periodicity corresponding 
to ⅓(111)c were evident for the 1:2 ordering 
structure along the 111 direction, as shown in 
Fig. 3(c). The wavelength of the superlattice 
modulation is 0.71 nm, which corresponds to 
the triple of (111)-planer spacing of a simple 
cubic unit cell (d111 = 2.363Ǻ).

The  τf  shows an almost linear increase 
with the decrease in the tolerance factor in 
region I where t ≥ 1.01, which corresponds to 
the solid solution of 
Ba1-xLax[Zn(1+x)/3Nb(2-x)/3]O3 with a 
composition of x = 0 to 0.1. The 112,000 of Q 
× f; 39.5 of εr and +19 ppm/ºC of τf was 
obtained for pure BZN with the composition of 
x = 0. The maximum of τf is +45 ppm/ºC, 
where t = 1.01. In region , the BLZN has Ⅱ
0.965 ≤ t < 1.01 with the composition of x = 
0.2 to 0.5. The τf decreased rapidly with the 
decrease in tolerance factor, including the 
reverse of its sign. The minimum of τf  is -42 
ppm/ºC, where t = 0.965. Then τf increased 
slowly as t decreased in region  where Ⅲ t < 
0.965, with the x = 0.5 to 0.6. This trend is the 
same as that obtained for a solid solution of 
complex perovskite compound described by 
Reaney et al.17

Ⅳ. Discussion 
F. Jiang et al.24 show that the A1g mode of 
Raman spectra can act as a probe for the 
chemical ordering at the B site. The A1g mode 
is a simple breathing type mode of oxygen 
atoms, and a simple harmonic model can be 
used to discuss the effect of lanthanum doping 
on the frequency of A1g mode. 
*m
k=ω  
where k is the force constant that is related to 
O-O and O-B bond strength, and m* is the 
reduced mass of this mode. The smaller ionic 
radius of La3+ (1.46Å), in comparison with that 
of Ba2+ (1.74Å), causes the decrease in lattice 
parameter with an increase in lanthanum 
concentration. Therefore, it is expected that the 
force constant will increase with La-doping. 
The B-site atoms will affect the value of the 
reduced mass if the distribution of Zn/Nb at the 
B-site varies with lanthanum doping. In the 
space-charge model of 1:1 order, 'B is Zn of 
atomic mass 65, and "B is Nb of atomic mass 
93. The frequency of A1g mode will increase 
because the reduced mass remains unchanged 
in the case of the space-charge model. However, 
this is not consistent with the observation in Fig. 
6. The 'B is NbxZnx

22 −++  with an 
average atomic mass (74-18.7x), and "B is still 
Nb in the case of the random-site model with 
the formula of 
Ba1-xLax{[Zn(2+2x)/3Nb(1-2x)/3]1/2[Nb]1/2}O3. For a 
small amount of lanthanum doping, the reduced 
mass of the 'B site increased markedly and 
caused a decrease in A1g frequency. This result 
indicates that the random-site model is adopted 
in a 1:1 ordered structure of La-doping BZN 
ceramics.  
The variation in the frequency of A1g mode 
shows an opposite trend with the variation of τf. 
It indicates that some structural transitions were 
occurred at the composition of x > 0.1 and 0.5, 
respectively. The Nb-O bond strength of NbO6 
octahedra decreased with the increase of 
lanthanum substitution and caused the almost 
linear increase of τf where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1. The 
Nb-O bonds of NbO6 octahedral cage became 
stronger and caused the rapid decrease in τf 
where 0.1 < x ≤ 0.5. The frequency of A1g 
mode started to decrease and the τf increase 
slowly where 0.5 < x ≤ 0.6. 
In region I, BLZN did not undergo

inphase tilting resulted in the increase of τf as 
the tolerance factor decreased, where t < 0.965. 
The phase transition due to the tilting of 
oxygen octahedra can be divided into three 
regions, including untilted, antiphase tilted, and 
inphase plus antiphase tilted with the decrease 
in the tolerance factor. The perovskite phase 
will become unstable as t decreases. In the 
tilted structure, the volume of the unit cell will 
contract because of an increase on the 
amplitude of tilt. It caused the increase of bond 
strength for Nb-O bonds of NbO6 octahedra 
from the observation of A1g mode and the rapid 
decrease of τf because that antiphase tilting was 
occurred at 0.965 ≤ t < 1.01 with the 
composition of 0.1 < x ≤ 0.5. The inphase and 
antiphase tilting was occurred at t < 0.965 with 
the composition of 0.5 < x ≤ 0.6 and caused the 
slow increase in τf. It appears that the tilting of 
oxygen octahedra results in the variation of τf 
from the analysis of structural phase transition 
as a function of the tolerance factor.  
 
Ⅴ. Conclusion 
The substitution of lanthanum into 
low-loss Ba(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 microwave ceramics 
induced a series of structural phase transitions 
in the ordering of B-site cations and the tilting 
of oxygen octahedra. The structure is changed 
from a 1:2 to a 1:1 ordered structure and causes 
a great decrease on the quality factor by a low 
level of lanthanum substitution, which is 5%. 
The 1:1 ordered microstructure in the BLZN 
compound could be interpreted by the 
random-site model from the analysis of Raman 
spectra. Furthermore, the lanthanum 
substitution causes the phase transformation 
about antiphase and inphase tilting of oxygen 
octahedra. It appears that the onset of 
octahedral tilting in complex perovskite causes 
a great influence on τf. In addition, from the 
presented data, τf can be predicted by using 
only the tolerance factor. The near to zero of τf 
could be obtained at x = 0.3 ~ 0.35 for the solid 
solution of BLZN complex perovskite 
compounds.
