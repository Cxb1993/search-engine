ABSTRACT: 
It is generally accepted that the physical properties and biodegradability of biodegradable 
polymers are influenced strongly by the crystallinity. Melting was the morphological reverse of 
crystallization with respect to the primary and secondary structures produced. Therefore, the 
studies of crystallization kinetics and melting behaviors should be paid enough attention, since 
they not only affect the crystalline structure and morphology of polymers but also affect the final 
physical properties. In this study, aliphatic homopolyesters and copolyesters derived from 
succinic acid and three different kinds of diols were synthesized by a two-step esterification 
reaction in the melt. Homopolyesters include poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(butylene 
succinate) (PBS) and poly(trimethylene succinate) (PTS). The values of the enthalpy of fusion of 
PES and PBS were determined from the melting point depression in the polymer-diluent system. 
Three diols are ethylene glycol (EG), 1,4-butandiol (BD) and 1,3- propandiol (PD), respectively. 
Copolyesters and blends were examined based on PES with the composition of BD or PBS 
ranging from 0% to 10%, and PBS with the composition of PD or PTS ranging from 0% to 10%.  
The chemical compositions and the sequence distribution in copolyesters were characterized by 
NMR spectroscopy. The temperatures of initial decomposition were determined by using 
thermogravimetry and polarized light microscope (PLM) in an inert environment. Isothermal 
growth rates of spherulites were measured using PLM by both isothermal and nonisothermal 
methods. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and PLM were used to study the crystallization 
kinetics. The melting behaviors of the specimens after isothermal and/or nonisothermal 
crystallization were investigated with DSC and temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC) at 
different heating rates. The reversing, total, and non-reversing heat flow curves were analyzed. 
The crystal structures at various temperatures were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis. 
 
Keywords: Aliphatic copolyesters, succinates, microstructure, crystallization kinetics, melting 
behavior, morphology, enthalpy of fusion 
Flory and coworkers33–35 proposed a method for
evaluating DHou from the melting point depression in
the polymer-diluent system. Malik and Nandi36 used
this method to estimate the heat of fusion of poly
(3-alkyl thiophene)s. Recently, Papageorgiou and
Bikiaris15 estimated the DHou of PES by dividing the
enthalpy of fusion obtained from the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) data by the crystallinity
(Xc) determined from wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) pattern, giving a value of 180 J/g.
In this study, PES, PBS, and PES-rich copolyesters
were synthesized. They were characterized using 1H
and 13C NMR, DSC, thermogravimetric analyzer
(TGA), and WAXD. The DHou value of PES was esti-
mated from the melting point depression in the PES-
acetophenone system according to the Flory equa-
tion.37 Furthermore, the rates of cold crystallization
and recrystallization of PES and PES-rich copoly-
mers from the amorphous glass state are compared,
and the degrees of crystallinity are also calculated
from the enthalpy of melting during heating utiliz-
ing the obtained value of DHou.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Ethylene glycol (EG) (Showa, 99.5%), 1,4-butanediol
(BD) (Acros, 99%), and succinic acid (SA) (Acros,
99%) were used without purification. Titanium tetra-
isopropoxide (TTP) (Acros, 98þ%) was used as
received. Other solvents for the analysis were also
used without purification.
Synthesis
PES, PBS, and PES-rich copolyesters were synthe-
sized by a two-step esterification reaction in the
melt. The reactor was a 1 L stainless flask that was
equipped with a magnetic agitator, an electric
heater, a nitrogen inlet and outlet, a drain, a water
cooling system, and a condenser. The reaction mix-
ture was charged into the reactor with a diols :
diacid molar ratio of 1 : 1. TTP was used as a cata-
lyst with a concentration of 0.1 mol % based on the
amount of diacid used. The first two columns of Ta-
ble T1I present the sample codes of copolyesters and
the feed ratios of the diols. As an example, the syn-
thesis of a copolyester with equal amounts of diols
(PEBSA 52/48) is described as follows.
The reaction mixture of EG (31 g; 0.5 mol), BD (45
g; 0.5 mol), SA (118 g; 1 mol), and TTP catalyst
(0.283 g; 1.0 mmol) was charged into the polycon-
densation reactor. The mixture was purged with
nitrogen and heated with an electrical heater around
the reactor. The temperature of the reactor was
raised to 150C to melt the acid component com-
pletely. Then the temperature was gradually raised
to 190C at 10C/h. The water byproduct formed
during the first stage was collected via a condenser.
The condenser was kept at 100C by an electrical
heater for the separation of water from the mono-
mers. The volume of water collected was 80 mol %
of the theoretically calculated value. In the second
stage of the reaction, the pressure was slowly
reduced to below 1 Torr, and the temperature was
raised to 220C after 3 h of reaction. This condition
was maintained for 20 h to facilitate further the reac-
tions of polycondensation and transesterification.
The synthesized polyester was dissolved in chloro-
form and precipitated into 10 times the amount of
vigorously stirred ice-cooled methanol. The precipi-
tate was filtered, washed with methanol, and dried
under reduced pressure at room temperature. The
other two copolyesters (PEBSA 93/7, PEBSA 90/10)
and PES and PBS homopolymers were synthesized
by the same procedures. Ivory white or pale brown
polyesters were finally obtained.
These polyesters had intrinsic viscosity values, [g],
ranging from 1.08 to 1.27 dL/g measured in 60/40
w/w phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane solution at
30C (see the second column of Table T2II). PES had a
[g] of 1.08 dL/g and a number average molecular
weight of 1.05  105 g/mol relative to poly(methyl
methacrylate).38,39 Therefore, the molecular weights
of these synthesized aliphatic polyesters are suffi-
ciently high for the subsequent studies.

derived from EG monomer is d ¼ 4.28–4.34 ppm
(H2). The two chemical shifts at 4.08–4.16 and 1.68–
1.74 ppm are associated with the methylene protons
a (H4) and b (H3) bonded to the ester oxygen in the
butylene succinate (BS) units. The composition of
this copolyester is determined from the relative inte-
gration areas of these proton peaks. The mol % of
BS moiety in PEBSA 52/48 is 47.4, as shown in the
third column of Table I. Rows 1 and 2 of the same
column present the compositions of the other two
copolymers.
FigureF2 2 displays the 13C NMR spectrum of
PEBSA 52/48. The chemical shifts of the ethylene
carbons and the carbonyl carbons of the succinic
moiety are at 28.70–29.00 (C1) and 171.94–172.30 (C5)
ppm, respectively. The diol carbons derived from
EG monomer are at 62.25–62.38 ppm (C2). For BS
units, the chemical shifts of the carbons a and b
bonded to the ester oxygen are located at 64.08–
64.20 (C4) and 25.11–25.22 (C3) ppm, respectively.
A magnified view of the 13C NMR spectrum of
PEBSA 52/48 reveals that the carbonyl carbons (C5)
are split into four peaks, as shown in the inserted
spectrum of Figure 2. The peak C5a is assigned to
the carbonyl carbons with ethylene groups on both
sides of the succinic ester, abbreviated as ESE. The
assigned C5b, C5c, and C5d peaks represent the car-
bonyl carbons of the ESB-E side, ESB-B side, and
BSB structures, respectively, as indicated in the
inserted spectra in Figure 2 (where E represents the
EG unit, S is the succinate unit, and B is the BD
unit). The slight variation in chemical shifts of these
four peaks is caused by the difference of the chemi-
cal environment, such that the integration areas can
be utilized to characterize the chemical microstruc-
tures of these copolyesters.
The total areas of C5a, C5b, C5c, and C5d peaks are
normalized to unity for each copolyester, and their
percentage values of each peak area are listed in
columns 4–7 of Table I under the subtitles of ESE,
ESB-E side, ESB-B side, and BSB. Two peaks (C5b
and C5c) of equal intensity are observed from the
unequivalent carbonyl carbons in the mixed diester
sequence ESB. Three possible triad sequences, ESE,
ESB, and BSB, of copolyesters are then calculated
from the normalized areas, and tabulated in columns
8–10 of the same Table. In the case of PEBSA 52/48,
P(ESE), P(ESB), and P(BSB) are 26.8, 51.1, and 22.1
mol %, respectively, as listed in the third row of Ta-
ble I. The ES% and BS% of copolyesters are given by
the following equations:
ES % ¼ PES ¼ PðESEÞ þ PðESBÞ=2 (3)
BS % ¼ PBS ¼ PðBSBÞ þ PðESBÞ=2 (4)
This copolyester is characterized by having 52.4
mol % ES units and 47.6 mol % BS units. Column 11
of Table I presents the ES% and BS% of other
copolyesters.
The randomness, b, of the copolymer40,41 is given
by b ¼ P(ESB)/(2PES  PBS), where PES and PBS are
the molar fractions of ES and BS units calculated
above. Copolyesters synthesized by polycondensa-
tion have generally been considered to have a ran-
dom distribution. The results are due to the
relatively equal reactivity of comonomers and the
random transesterification during the polycondensa-
tion process. For total randomness of a copolymer, b
is unity. The calculated b values of PEBSA 93/7, 90/
10, and 52/48 are 1.08, 1.11, and 1.02, respectively,

gradually moves to a lower temperature as the moi-
ety of the BS units increases. It ranges from 10.8 to
41.1C, as listed in the third column of Table II.
The copolyesters have intermediate Tg between those
of the parent homopolyesters. Such Tg depression is
attributed to the increase in the chain flexibility by
the incorporation of BS units. Furthermore, all of the
copolymers exhibit a single Tg value rather than two
Tg values which would correspond to possible
blocks of PES and PBS. Additionally, all of these
copolyesters have b (randomness parameter) values
of about 1.0, which are obtained from the 13C NMR
analysis (Table I). These results demonstrate that the
comonomer placement in these copolymers is essen-
tially random.
A cold crystallization peak and a small recrystalli-
zation peak just before the melting peak are
observed for PES and PBS homopolymers, as shown
in Figure 5. The peak temperature of cold crystalliza-
tion (Tcc) occurs at 15.5C for PBS, and this peak
is much sharper than that of PES (Tcc at 47.7
C),
indicating that the cold crystallization rate of PBS
significantly exceeds that of PES. The thermogram of
quenched PES reveals that the enthalpies of the cold
crystallization (DHcc), recrystallization (DHrc), and
melting (DHm) are 40.3, 4.9, and 45.7 J/g, respec-
tively. A net enthalpy value of zero implies that
amorphous PES was obtained after its thermal his-
tory was erased at 170C for 5 min. The degrees of
crystallinity caused by cold crystallization and
recrystallization are 24.7 and 3.0%, respectively. The
values of DHm of PEBSA 93/7 and PEBSA 90/10 are
44.9 and 18.5 J/g, respectively. The degrees of crys-
tallinity calculated from DHm are 28.0% for PES,
27.5% for PEBSA 93/7, and 11.3% for PEBSA 90/10.
For PEBSA 93/7 and PEBSA 90/10, Tcc moves
from 53.3 to 56.3C (fourth column of Table II) and
the corresponding peak becomes weaker and
broader, as shown in Figure 5. No cold crystalliza-
tion is detected in the curve of PEBSA 52/48.
Clearly, the incorporation of a few BS units into PES
slows down the cold crystallization rate of amor-
phous specimens. Therefore, the intensity of the
melting peak decreases, and the corresponding Tm
falls from 100.9, through 94.5 to 89.8C, as listed in
the last column of Table II. In the case of PEBSA 52/
48, Tm was 37.8
C when the specimen kept at room
temperature for more than 3 days.
Thermal stability
Figure F66 plots the weight loss (solid curve) and the
derivative of weight loss (dotted curve) versus tem-
perature for PEBSA 52/48 copolyester in flowing
nitrogen at a heating rate of 10C/min. At tempera-
tures below 240C, the specimen appears to be sta-
ble; it exhibits noticeable weight loss only above
241.1C (defined as Tstart from the derivative curve
of weight loss). Tloss2% is defined as the temperature
at a weight loss of 2% from the weight loss curve. It
was 285.4C for PEBSA 52/48. The rate of weight
loss gradually increased to a maximum at 404.5C
(defined as Tmax and identified from the derivative
of the weight loss curve). Table T3III presents these
three values for all of the polyesters used in this
study, along with their average values. These poly-
esters exhibit no significant difference or no trend
because the experiment depends on the size, shape,
and crystallinity of the specimens.
Wide angle X-ray diffraction
Figure F77 presents WAXD patterns of PES, PBS, and
PES-rich copolyesters that were isothermally crystal-
lized at 5–20C below their respective Tm values.
The unit cell of the crystalline PES a form is ortho-
rhombic,12,13 and the diffraction peaks from the (120)
and (200) planes are observed at 2y  20.2 and
23.4, respectively. Both PEBSA 93/7 and 90/10
copolyesters have diffraction peaks of the PES a
form, but their intensity decreases as the moiety of
the BS units increases. The unit cell of the crystalline
PBS a form is monoclinic,22,23 and the diffraction
peaks from the (020) and (110) planes are observed
at 2y  19.6 and 22.7, respectively. The WAXD pat-
tern of PEBSA 52/48 has the characteristic peaks of
the PBS a form, but with very low intensity.
