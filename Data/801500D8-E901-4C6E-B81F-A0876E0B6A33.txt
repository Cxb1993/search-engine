一、前言 
    空氣中的懸浮微粒對人體會產生健康效應，尤其是對患有呼吸道疾病的易感染族群所造
成的影響更加明顯。當懸浮微粒的粒徑小於 2.5μm 時，會對健康產生更強烈的不良效應影響，
特別是超細微粒（Dp<100 nm）。因為在相同質量狀況下超細微粒具有著更高的數目濃度，而
且其總表面積較大，所以會有較大的機會穿透或是與細胞產生交互反應作用（Oberdörster，
2001；Oberdörster 等，2004）。Oberdörster 等（2002） 指出超細微粒可穿過細胞膜進入血液，
甚至可以到達腦部。 
    超細微粒在大氣環境中約佔總懸浮微粒數目濃度 80%的比例（Hussein 等，2005），但是
若是從質量濃度的角度來分析的話，其超細微粒質量濃度佔總質量濃度的比例卻是很少，因
為環境中懸浮微粒的質量濃度大多為粗微粒及細微粒所貢獻，因此超細微粒所佔的比例很
低，不過超細微粒卻有較高的數目濃度以及較大的總表面積。因此，超細微粒在環境中的分
佈情形值得深入探討。 
 
二、研究目的 
    超細微粒自交通工具引擎燃燒排放為誘導呼吸器官及心血管疾病的重要因素，在高速公
路上超細微粒峰值濃度可為一般戶外環境條件的數倍，尤其是近似密閉空間的公路隧道。以
往研究隧道內空氣品質的方式不外乎（1）定點採樣；在隧道入口、中間、出口處進行採樣，
此方法僅能片面了解隧道內空氣品質。（2）數值模擬；以定點採樣結果進行流場模擬，此方
法很難印証整體模擬結果是否真實。其中一般研究多認為隧道中心點的污染物濃度最高，但
另有研究認為車流對空氣的擠壓會導致距離隧道出口出處的濃度會最高。另外，以往在隧道
內所做的研究大多侷限於 NOx、CO2、CO、PM10 或 PM2.5，較少有對超細微粒進行研究。因
此對於近似密閉空間的高速公路長隧道內超細微粒數目濃度分佈特性有需要進一步探討，本
研究利用道路上（on-road）測量方法進行高速公路長隧道內超細微粒數目濃度測量。將快速
移動微粒粒徑儀(Fast Mobility Particle Sizer; FMPS)裝置在交通工具上測量自隧道入口前 1 公
里至離開隧道後 1 公里超細微粒數目濃度的變化，並探討其粒徑分布與超細微粒濃度受尖峰
與離峰車流量的影響、上波與下坡路段超細微粒濃度的差異性。 
 
三、文獻探討 
在都會區，交通工具為超細微粒的主要排放源，在鄰近主要高速公路地區的超細微粒數
目濃度可高達 105 particles cm-3 ，較一般環境的超細微粒數目濃度來的高 （Hitchins 等，2000；
Zhu 等， 2002；Reponen 等，2003；Beckerman 等，2008；Hagler 等，2008）。Harrison 等（2004）
指出道路交通污染源為超細微粒的主要產生源（佔 60%）。Hitchins 等 （2000）指出鄰近主
要道路的超細微粒數目濃度較一般都會區高 3.5－7 倍。Zhu 等 （2002）指出於高速公路下
風處 30 公尺處的超細微粒數目濃度約為 1.5×105 particles cm-3，在下風處 300 公尺處的超細微
粒數目濃度遞減為 3.7×104 particles cm-3。Kittelson 等（2004）証實在 Minnesota 高速公路上
的超細微粒數目濃度介於 104 至 106 particles cm-3 之間，其主要粒徑小於 50 nm。同時，在距
離高速公路 10－20 公尺處住宅區的超細微粒數目濃度遠低於高速公路上的超細微粒數目濃
度，但是其粒徑分布卻相似。在遠離高速公路 500－700 公尺處的住宅區有較低的超細微粒數
目濃度且微粒變得較大。Yli-Tuomi 等（2005） 在芬蘭利用道路上交通工具(on-road vehicles)
測量在市中心與高速公路 10 s 平均微粒數目濃度分別為 1.5×105 和 2.2×105 particles cm-3。 
 3
因溫度或 CO 濃度並沒有達到啟動換氣豎井的水準，因此在隧道入口段及中間段的超細微粒
數目濃度並沒被稀釋的現象。由實驗結果顯示雪山隧道內通風換氣豎井在啟動狀況下能有效
稀釋降低超細微粒數目濃度 10–50 %。另外，北向上坡隧道內的超細微粒數目濃度顯著高於
南向下坡隧道內的超細微粒數目濃度的主要原因為車輛在上坡條件下引擎的負載較高，導致
車輛所排放的超細微粒較多。無論在北向上坡或南向下坡路段，在隧道出口下游約 100-200 m
處的超細微粒數目濃度會急速下降至外界環境的濃度水準，其主要原因為隧道的活塞效應，
氣流被車輛推擠到隧道外。結果顯示車流量、上下坡與通風條件會對隧道內的超細微粒數目
濃度產生影響。圖 2a 和 2b 分別為南北向隧道內溫度和濕度的典型分布狀況，溫度在隧道入
口處最低，然後逐漸上升至出口處，同樣地在南向與北向隧道中距離隧道入口 9.5 km 與 10.7 
km 處亦可明顯觀察到溫度的下降。相同地，濕度在隧道入口處會略為上升後持續下降至隧道
出口處才再回升。這些現象可以證明車輛廢氣與通風換氣豎井對隧道內溫溼度的影響。 
5.2 隧道內超細微粒粒徑分布 
    圖 3a-d 分別為背景條件下、一般車流條件下，南向與北向隧道上游處、入口段、中間段
與出口段的微粒粒徑分布。測量結果顯示隧道內的微粒粒徑分布呈雙峰狀態，二個峰值約分
別在 11 nm 與 52 nm。在隧道入口段的超細微粒數目濃度顯著低於中間段與出口段的超細微
粒數目濃度。以北向上坡路段為例，在入口段的超細微粒粒徑主要為 nucleation mode，但是
在中間段與出口段的超細微粒粒徑卻為 Aitken mode。測量結果顯示隧道內的超細微粒自車輛
排放後，會在隧道內進行膠結行為，導致這些被侷限在隧道內的微粒互相碰撞而由 nucleation 
mode 微粒形成較大的 Aitken mode 微粒。圖 4 為北向上坡隧道內 10.8 nm、19.1 nm、29.4 nm、
52.3 nm、80.6 nm 和 107.5 nm 微粒自隧道入口處至出口處的數目濃度變化，由圖可觀察到在
隧道內不同粒徑微粒的數目濃度變化狀況。10.8 nm 與 19.1 nm 的微粒在隧道入口段的濃度最
高，然後逐漸下降，這些微粒進行膠結行為後轉變成較大的微粒，因此可明顯觀察到>29.4 nm
的微粒數目濃度會隨著距離隧道入口的距離增加而上升。Yao 等 (2005) 亦觀察到相同的結
果，在隧道入口段的微粒粒徑以 10 nm 為主，另一個次要的峰值為 50 nm。當越深入隧道內，
10 nm 微粒會逐漸消失，而 50 nm 微粒則會逐漸成為主要的微粒粒徑。到了隧道出口段，微
粒粒徑以 50 nm 為主，另一個次要的峰值則變成 10 nm 。 
 
六、結論 
    測量結果顯示車輛所排放的微粒會被侷限在隧道內，這些超細微粒會在隧道內進行劇烈
的膠結運動。長隧道內的超細微粒粒徑分布呈雙峰狀態，主要的峰值在 52 nm，次要的峰值
在 11 nm。隧道內的 nucleation mode 微粒會藉由膠結行為轉換成 Aitken mode 微粒。另外，
隧道內的超細微粒數目濃度會受到車流量、上下坡條件及通風換氣條件所影響。在假日塞車
狀況下隧道內的超細微粒數目濃度可高達 1.0×106 particles cm-3 以上。

a b s t r a c t
This study measured ultraﬁne particle (UFP) levels and their size distributions in the Hsuehshan tunnel
from August 12 to 19, 2009, using a Fast Mobility Particle Sizer. Measurement results demonstrate that
trafﬁc volume, the slope of the tunnel (downhill or uphill) and the ventilation system affected UFP levels
inside the tunnel. Average UFP levels were about 1.0  105e3.0  105 particles cm3 at normal trafﬁc
volume. A trafﬁc jam in the tunnel could raise UFP levels to over 1.0  106 particles cm3. UFP levels at
the uphill bore were signiﬁcantly higher than those at the downhill bore due to high UFP levels
exhausted from vehicles going uphill at high engine load conditions. UFP levels eventually diluted
10e50% with fresh air from tunnel air shafts. Gas-to-particle condensation conversion markedly
produced nucleation mode particles at the tunnel entrance section. Observations also showed Aitken
mode particles markedly formed by coagulation growth of nucleation mode particles in the tunnel
middle section and exit section. That is, the particle size distributions changed signiﬁcantly inside the
tunnel. Measurement results suggest that particles in the Aitken mode in the long tunnel governed UFP
levels.

1. Introduction
Epidemiologic researches have shown increased adverse
cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes related to freshly gener-
ated ultraﬁne particles (UFPs) which diameters less than 100 nm
(Gilmour et al., 2004; Sioutas et al., 2005). UFPs aremore harmful to
health than large particles because they have higher order of
magnitude particle number concentrations and surface area, and
larger concentrations of adsorbed or condensed toxic air pollutants
than large particles with the same mass. These particles reach and
become deposited in the alveoli where they interact with epithelial
cells (Oberdörster, 2001; Brown et al., 2002). The blood transports
UFPs to other organs such as the liver, within 4e24 h after exposure
(Oberdörster et al., 2002). Researches have also demonstrated UFP
transport to the brain via the olfactory nerve (Oberdörster et al.,
2004). UFPs from trafﬁc exhausts can induce DNA damage due to
systemic oxidative stress (Bräuner et al., 2007; Møller et al., 2008),
thus exposure to fresh ultraﬁne particulate pollution is a serious
environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer
mortality.
Over 80% of airborne particles in urban air are in the ultraﬁne size
range (Shi et al., 2001). The concentration ofUFPs correlates strongly
with concentrations of NOx and CO (Ketzel et al., 2003; Sardar et al.,
2004; Pirjola et al., 2006; Beckermanet al., 2008;Hagler et al., 2009),
suggesting that trafﬁc emissions are the primary source of UFPs in
urban environments.Mean number concentrations of UFPs in urban
areas range between 1.0  104 and 2.0  104 particles cm3 (Noble
et al., 2003; Hussein et al., 2004; Matson, 2005). Number concen-
trations of UFPs near a major highway are >105 particles cm3,
signiﬁcantly higher than those for urban backgrounds by 5e10
times, and the UFP levels decrease exponentially with increased
downwinddistance fromahighway (Zhu et al., 2002; Reponen et al.,
2003; Pirjola et al., 2006; Beckerman et al., 2008; Hagler et al., 2009;
Buonanno et al., 2009). For example, Hitchins et al. (2000) measure
that at a distance of 100e150mdownwind from the road, UFP levels
decrease to around half the level at 15 m from the road. Zhu et al.
(2002) also note that the average UFP level at 30m downwind from
a highway is 1.5  105 particles cm3, and the UFP level decreases
exponentially to background levels at 300 m downwind from the
highway. Despite dilution of the exhaust plume downwind of the
highway, Barone and Zhu (2008) note that particles may collide and
merge causing an increase in the fraction of larger particles. Thus,
coagulation may play a role in altering the particle size distribution
at downwind of the highway.

and the other two sets of fans are used for the northbound bore. The
polluted, hot air is discharged to the exhaust shaft using four sets of
fans. Two sets of fans are used for discharging polluted air from the
southbound bore into the shaft and the other two sets of fans are
used for the northbound bore. Fans in the air exchange stations
trigger individually at temperatures of >40 C or CO level >75 ppm
in the tunnel. The air in one bore at interchange station is diverted
into the other bore. This air interchange between the two bores
permits using one bore as an auxiliary air to help the other bore
maintain satisfactory air quality. Each air interchange station is
comprised of four sets of fans. Two sets of fans divert air from the
southbound bore into the northbound bore and the other two sets
of fans divert air from the northbound bore into the southbound
bore. The interchange air station is triggered when the CO level is
>75 ppm in any bore direction. Tables 1 and 2 present the locations
of air exchange stations and interchange stations inside the
Hsuehshan tunnel.
2.2. Sampling equipment and data collection
This study utilized a FMPS (TSI Model 3091) to measure UFP
number concentrations and size distributions in the range of
6e560 nmwith 32 size channels. The FMPS uses electrical mobility
methods to measure particle size spectra. The instrument consists
of a particle charger, a classiﬁcation column, and a series of
detection electrometers. The stream containing positively charged
particles ﬂows along with sheath air and passes a high voltage
electrode that repels the particles toward the electrometers. Small
particles with high electrical mobility are repelled to the elec-
trometers near the top of the column, and large particles with low
electrical mobility are deﬂected further downstream. The particles
transfer their charges to the electrometers generating currents that
are inverted to produce a particle size distribution. The FMPS can
provide a good time resolution to measure particle number
concentrations and size distributions in 1 s, while a Scanning
Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) typically takes 30 s or longer to
measure a particle size distribution.
Recently, the performance of the FMPS has been demonstrated
by Jeong and Evans (2009), showing that the SMPS number
concentration in the size range 6e100 nm is substantially lower
than the FMPS measurements about 34% due to diffusion losses of
particles in the SMPS. The diffusion loss corrected SMPS (C-SMPS)
number concentration is on average 14% higher than the FMPS data.
Jeong and Evans (2009) also note that the particle size distribution
measured by the FMPS is a little different from the size distribution
measured by the C-SMPS in the size range 9e26 nm. However, Yao
et al. (2006) show ultraﬁne particle concentrations at roadside, on
road and in the tunnel can vary rapidly in the second scale, impli-
cating that particle size distributions collected by the long scan-
time SMPS in such environments can yield misleading and/or
meaningless. That is, the FMPS is more suitable than the SMPS used
to obtain high time resolution number and size distribution data at
roadside or on road (Westerdahl et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2009;
Kozawa et al., 2009).
This work installed a FMPS in a van powered by a high-capacity
battery linked to a DCeAC converter. During on-road measure-
ments, ambient air was sampled through 5m of Tygon tubewith an
inner diameter of 1.27 cm from the sampling inlet to the FMPS at
a ﬂow rate of 10 L min1 (the ﬂow Reynolds number is about 1100).
The calculated diffusion and settling losses for particles within
6e560 nm were smaller than 1% in the sampling tube. The Tygon
tube outside the van was ﬁxed on the roof of the van through
a 2.7 m aluminum pipe. The sample air intake was located 1.85 m
above the ground horizontally projected 1.1 m from the roof of the
van over the front windshield. This positionwas chosen to avoid the
inﬂuence from the van's own exhaust emissions, and to reduce
the effect of particular matter blown up by wind and car move-
ment. The transit time of the sampling air from the tube inlet to the
FMPS computed from the ﬂow rate was 6.6 s. Before each on-road
measurement, the FMPS was zero-checked with a ﬁlter. The FMPS
was operated continuously to obtain temporal proﬁles of UFP levels
inside the tunnel, and data were recorded at 1 s intervals by the
FMPS software. The traveling time in the tunnel was also marked
when the sampling car passed through each kilometer milestone
from the entrance to the exit. Temporal proﬁles of UFP levels were

section were similar to those obtained by Gouriou et al. (2004) in
a short tunnel (1.6 km). However, the full proﬁles of UFP levels for
the long tunnel were markedly different from those in the short
tunnel, especially for the uphill tunnel. The levels of UFPs decreased
abruptly at about 100e200 m downwind from the tunnel exit at
both bores. High levels of UFPs at downwind from the tunnel exit
can be attributed to “piston effect” in which particular matter was
pushed through the tunnel by wind and moving vehicles and then
diluted by outside fresh air. Finding show similar proﬁles of UFP
levels between background conditions and normal trafﬁc volume
conditions for the southbound bore and northbound bore.
Measurement results indicate that trafﬁc volume, the slope of the
tunnel (downhill or uphill) and the ventilation system affected UFP
levels inside the tunnel.
Fig. 5a and b shows the typical proﬁles of temperature and R.H.
at early hours and daytime inside the tunnel for the southbound
bore and northbound bore during the sampling periods. The
average temperature inside the long tunnel was higher than those
outside the tunnel about 4e8 C. The average R.H. inside the long
tunnel was lower than those outside the tunnel about 10e30%. The
temperature increasedwith increased downwind distance from the
tunnel entrance. In addition, the R.H. decreased with increased
downwind distance from the tunnel entrance. The highest
temperature and lowest R.H. were observed at the exit section of
the tunnel due to the waste heat accumulated in the tunnel which
was exhausted from vehicles. That is why the fans of the exchange
air station at the exit section were triggered during the sampling
periods. In addition, the temperature and R.H. inside the north-
bound were higher and lower than those inside the southbound
bore about 1e2 C and 2e4%, respectively. The temperature
signiﬁcantly dropped and R.H. markedly rose at about 9.5 km from
the tunnel entrance at the southbound bore because the dry and
hot air inside the tunnel was mixed with the outside wet and cold
air that exchanged from the fresh air shaft at early hours. The same
situations also can be observed at about 10.7 km from the tunnel
entrance at the northbound bore at early hours. But, the tempera-
ture did not signiﬁcantly drop and R.H. did not markedly rise near
the fresh air shaft at both southbound bore and northbound bore at
daytime due to the temperature of the outside air was not signiﬁ-
cantly lower than that inside the tunnel.
3.3. Change in ultraﬁne particle size distribution within the tunnel
Fig. 6aed shows average particle size distributions at the
upstream tunnel, entrance section, middle section, and exit section
for the background condition and normal trafﬁc volume condition
for the southbound bore and northbound bore. Measurement
results indicate two modes of UFP number size distributions in the
Hsuehshan (nucleation mode and Aitken mode)dthe ﬁrst and
second mode diameters were about 11 nm and 52 nm, respectively.
The levels of UFPs at the upstream tunnel were signiﬁcantly lower
than those at the tunnel entrance section, due to ambient air
diluting UFP levels immediately when they exhausted from vehi-
cles. Nucleation mode particles remained at relatively high levels at
the tunnel entrance section, while the levels of larger particles
increased at the tunnel middle section (Table 3).
Yao et al. (2005) demonstrated a similar particle size distribu-
tion to the current study, showing that a bimodal distribution
pattern with a dominant mode at 10 nm and a minor mode at
50 nm at the entrance section of the tunnel was observed to
transform as increased the distance from the tunnel entrance.
Deeper into the tunnel, the 10 nm mode particles gradually
decreased while simultaneously the 50 nm mode particles
increased. At the exit of the tunnel, 50 nm dominated and 10 nm
became minor.
Geller et al. (2005) demonstrated that particle number mode
diameter in the Caldecott tunnel (about 1.1 km length) was about
15e20 nm. Sturm et al. (2003) suggested that UFPs at the middle
point inside the Plabutsch tunnel (about 10 km length) had
a bimodal distributionwith one peak <30 nm and a second peak at
about 80 nm. Compared with measurements acquired by Geller
et al. (2005), UFP mode diameters in a short tunnel were smaller

long tunnel. Measurements suggest that coagulation plays an
important role to remove nucleation particles in a conﬁned envi-
ronment, also concluded by Gidhagen et al. (2003), Sturm et al.
(2003), and Ketzel and Berkowicz (2004).
4. Conclusions
Measurement results indicated that trafﬁc volume signiﬁcantly
affected UFP levels inside the tunnel and particulate matter can be
imprisoned inside the tunnel due to being in a conﬁned space.
Levels of UFPs increased with increasing downwind distance from
the tunnel entrance. This study demonstrated that UFP levels at the
uphill bore were signiﬁcantly higher than those at the downhill
bore due to high levels of UFPs exhausted fromvehicles going uphill
at high engine load conditions. The proﬁles of UFP levels in the long
tunnel were markedly different from those in the short tunnel,
especially for the uphill tunnel. This study found that particle sizes
changed signiﬁcantly in the long highway tunnel. In the long tunnel
environment, the nucleation mode particles produced by gas-to-
particle condensation conversion were observed in the tunnel
entrance section, and the levels and time that the polluted air
stayed in the long tunnel were sufﬁcient to allow coagulation to
become an important process for nucleation mode particles. These
nucleation mode particles can grow to become Aitken mode
particles through coagulation process. Measurement results sug-
gested that particles in the Aitken mode governed UFP levels in the
long tunnel.

(英文) Evaluation the Effects of Traffic Volumes and Wind 
Speeds on Ambient Ultrafine Particle Levels at the 
Highway Toll Station 
 3
   The number concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP) near a major highway are >105 particles 
cm-3, significantly higher than those for urban backgrounds by 5–10 times. While the relationship of 
the traffic-produced UFPs to meteorological factors such as wind speed on the highway is little 
known and needs to be researched. 
   This study used a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) to measure UFP concentrations. 
Hourly traffic data were obtained from the Toll Station Administration. Local meteorological data 
were recorded by a Vantage Pro 2TM Weather Station, set up on the toll plaza beside the SMPS. 
   Overall UFP levels at the ETC lane were 3.6×103–8.3×105 particles cm-3 (mean= 9.4×104 
particles cm-3). Figure 1 shows the relationship between wind speed and the elevated UFP level by 
traffic volume. Here, the elevated UFP level is defined as the measured UFP level to take off the 
background UFP level, considered as UFPs exhausted directly from vehicles. The background UFP 
level on the highway was treated as 1.0×104 particles cm-3 in this study. The statistical results 
demonstrate that the relationship between wind speed and the elevated UFP level by traffic volume 
can be expressed as Y= exp[-0.947ln(X)+5.08] (R2=0.49).

Figure 1 Relationship of wind speed vs. elevated UFP level by traffic volume. 
 
    Measurement results show that the elevated UFP level due to the traffic volume decreased 
exponentially with increased wind speed on the highway, that is, atmospheric dilution of UFPs by 
the wind was significant. According to measurement results, high levels of UFP are observable at 
low wind speed and high traffic volume. Furthermore, the variations of UFP levels at the highway 
toll station are not only caused by local wind speed and traffic emission, but are also influenced by 
complex meteorological conditions, such as the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. 
Investigating this topic in the future should be interesting.
