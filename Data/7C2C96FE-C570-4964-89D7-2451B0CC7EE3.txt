五、文獻探討
Types of business strategy:
Miles and Snow (1978) divided business strategy into four types: (1) prospectors: value new product
and new market development and provide products with differentiation; (2) defenders: market
segmentation upon limited niche market and acquire competitive advantages by reducing cost and
improving efficiency; (3) analyzers: between prospectors and defenders, have rapid reaction by following
prospectors in changeable market and maintain original products and services in stable market as
defenders; (4) reactors: when encountering the environmental change, they lack complete planning and
adaption abilities and they passively and blindly respond to environmental pressure. Durand and
Coeurderoy (2001) divided business strategy into: (1) cost leadership: reduce prices of products or
services by improving efficiency and reducing costs in order to acquire maximum business volume; (2)
marketing differentiation: provide products and services different from other rivals, value product and
service quality, innovation and originality; (3) innovative differentiation: introduce innovative products
and services which are not easily imitated by rivals to increase competitive advantages. This study treated
cost leadership, marketing differentiation and innovative differentiation proposed by Durand and
Coeurderoy (2001) as classification of high-tech industry business strategy.
Information technology involvement
Sakaguchi and Dibrell (1998) suggested that information technology involvement could be
measured by information technology investment and training. Information technology investment is
measured by quantitative measures on budgets and software and hardware devices. Information
technology training refers to the training for information technology related personnel. Chung,et
al.(2010a) reviewed relevant literature and group information technology involvement into the following
four dimensions: (1) perceptions of employees; (2) investments in hardware and software; (3) personnel
training and (4) the degrees of information technology application. Based on literature review (Miller and
Doyle, 1987; Sohal et al., 2001; Sakaguchi and Dibrell, 1998; Lee, 2006; Chung, et al., 2010a), this study
divided information technology involvement into perceptions of employees, investments in hardware and
software, personnel training and the degrees of information technology application.
Types of organizational culture
Lee and Yu (2004), organizational culture is the special atmosphere or belief created by
4Based on literature review above, this study proposes H2: A higher level of information technology
involvement leads to more significant and positive influence on the implementation level of CRM
activities.
Types of organizational culture and CRM activities
Agarwal et al. (2004) suggested that organizational culture is critical in implementation level of
CRM activities. Van Bentum and Stone (2005) indicated that organizational culture significantly
influences implementation of CRM activities. Li (2008) suggested that it is necessary to create
appropriate type of organizational culture in order to reduce the obstacles of implementation of CRM
activities. Based on literature review above, this study proposes H3: Different types of organizational
culture significantly and differently influence implementation of CRM activities.
CRM activities and business performance
According to Christy et al. (1996), implementation of CRM could increase profits and market share
of products or services. Swift (2001) indicated that CRM is the operational model which allows firms to
probe into and influence customers’behavior by interaction with customers, and enhance customer
loyalty and customers’profit rate. Tiwana (2001) indicated that implementation of CRM activities helps
firms to improve customer relationship and obtain more profits from original customers. Based on
literature review above, this study proposes H4: A higher implementation level of CRM leads to more
significant and positive influence on business performance.
六、研究方法
This study intended to probe into the correlation among type of business strategy, information
technology involvement, type of organizational culture, CRM activities and business performance in
high-tech industry.
Research Hypotheses
According to literature review, the hypotheses are shown below:
H1: Different types of business strategy significantly and differently influence implementation of CRM
activities.
H2: A higher level of information technology involvement leas to more significant and positive influence
on implementation level of CRM activities.
H3: Different types of type of organizational culture significantly and differently influence
implementation of CRM activities.
H4: A higher implementation level of CRM activities leads to more significant and positive influence on
business performance.
Questionnaire collection
The subjects of this research were high-tech firms in the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park,
6generalized four steps and 13 measurements. The measurement is based on Likert 5-point scale, where
“Strongly agree” is 5 points, “Agree” is 4 points, “Fair” is 3 points, “Disagree” is 2 points, and “Strongly 
disagree” is 1 point.
Measurement of business performance
According to literature review and business characteristics of high-tech industry, this study treats
profit rate, growth of sales, product and service quality, customer maintenance rate, successful new
products to market and return on investment as measures of performance of firms. The measures include
below: (1) profit rate of the firm is higher than the rivals’; (2) growth of sales of the firm is higher than
the rivals’; (3) customers are more satisfy with product or service quality of the firm than rivals’; (4) high
percentage of old customers trading with the firm again; (5) higher percentage of successful new products
to market than rivals’; (6) return on investment of the firm is higher than rivals’. The measurement is
based on Likert 5-point scale, where “Strongly agree” is 5 points, “Agree” is 4 points, “Fair” is 3 points, 
“Disagree” is 2 points, and “Strongly disagree” is 1 point.
Industry group and enterprise scale
This paper examines industry characteristics with two metrics, which are industry group and
enterprise scale：(1) Industry group: According to the classification published in 2010 Directory of
Manufacturers in Science Park, these industries are integrated circuits, computers & peripherals,
communication, optical electronics, delicate machinery and biotechnology; (2) Enterprise scale: In
accordance with the standards set forth by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this paper classifies
high-tech manufacturers into large ones (with over 200 employees) and small-and-medium ones (with
less than 200 employees). Both industry group and enterprise scale are measured with nominal scales.

8performance. The findings demonstrate that different types of business strategy significantly and
differently influence the implementation of CRM activities. A higher degree of differentiation strategy
(marketing differentiation or innovative differentiation) leads to a more significant influence on the
implementation of CRM activities. A higher information technology involvement and organizational
culture significantly and positively influence the implementation level of CRM activities; a higher
implementation level of CRM activities significantly and positively influences business performance.
However, different types of organizational culture do not significantly influence the implementation level
of CRM activities. In order to increase business performance, firms should enhance differentiation
strategies (marketing differentiation and innovative differentiation), increase information technology
involvement and implementation of CRM activities, combine and use the characteristics of the four
cultures in the competing values framework, and develop the implementation level of these four cultures.
This study only focused on high-tech firms. Future studies could conduct an empirical analysis of other
industries to examine any correlation between type of business strategy, information technology
involvement, type of organizational culture, implementation level of CRM activities, and business
performance in the organizations in different industries, and so acquire more complete research findings.
