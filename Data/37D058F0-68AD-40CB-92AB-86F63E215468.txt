Abstract
The research improves the analysis of the measurement system. It modifies the method for
calculating gauge variance. The comparison of gauge variance estimators for many methods
based on the criterion of the biasness, variance, and mean squares error (MSE) of the estimators
by a factorial arrangement of three parameters in a simulating measurement system shows that the
modified estimator proposed is better than or equal to the others.

1. Introduction
Due to the rapid development of the high-tech industry and the requirement of the high quality
from the customers, the accuracy and precision on the measurement system will affect the quality
of statistical analysis. Before data collection a complete check including the alignment of gauge
itself, the training of operators, and gauge variation study is required so that the analyst can make
the correct decision. In the QS 9000, ISO/IEC 17025, and TS 16949 quality assurance systems,
the analysis of repeatability and reproducibility of the measurement variation is to apply the
verified measurement system to the measurement process. Most of the industries apply these
assurance systems to judge the acceptance of their measurement systems.
The random effects model used for analyzing a measurement system is presented as

3. Comparison and result
We compare the gauge variance estimators of the five different analysis methods by simulating a
measurement system based on the criterion of the biasness, variance, and mean squares error
(MSE) of the gauge variance estimate.
The result of mean ratios of the gauge variance estimates for the five different methods are
presented in Table 4. It showed that ANOVA method produces unbiased gauge variance estimator.
The MCRR method generates overestimated estimator while MLF, CRR, and LF methods
generate underestimated estimators. They also revealed MCRR and MLF estimators are much
better than those of CRR and LF.
Table 5 showed the result of sample variances of gauge variance estimates. The MLF estimator
has the smallest variance while the LF estimator is the second smallest.

Tsai (1988) defined the gauge reproducibility as the variability due to different operators using
the same gauge and the gauge repeatability as the variability reflecting the basic precision of the
gauge itself. The gauge variability is composed of the gauge reproducibility and the gauge
repeatability. The variance components of the total observed variability includes both the part
variability and gauge variability. The random effects model used for analyzing a measurement
system is presented as

The ijkY is the k
th repeated measurement on the ith part by the jth operator.  is the process
average. Pi is the ith part effect. Oj is the jth operator effect. POij is the interaction between the ith
part and the jth operator. Rijk is the error term. The source of variation can be divided into four
components which are parts, operators, interaction between parts and operators, and the random
error term. Pi 、Oj 、POij, and, Rijk are random factors normally distributed with mean 0 and
constant variances equal to 2P , 2O , 2PO , and 2R respectively. The effects of parts and
operators, the interaction between parts and operators, and the error terms are assumed to be
additive. The estimated gauge variance is the sum of variances of repeatability and reproducibility.

The value d2 depends on the number of repeated measurements taken on the same part by the
same operator. Here d2 is equal to 1.128.

In order to make both Classical GR&R and Long Form methods suitable to the cases of with
interaction between parts and operators, referring to the tabular form in Table 1, we first calculate

7. Criterions for Comparison
There are three criteria for comparison. They are MSE, sample variance, and mean ratio of the
gauge variance estimates.
The MSE of gauge variance estimator is

where n is the number of simulation runs. In our example n is equal to 10000. The MSE is a
combined index of accuracy and precision of an estimator. The smaller of the MSE value, the
better the estimator is.
The sample variance of the gauge variance estimates is presented as Equation (13). The smaller
of it, the higher precision of the estimator and the narrower width of its confidence interval are.
