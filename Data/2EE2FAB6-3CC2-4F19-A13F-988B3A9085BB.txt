INTRODUCTION
Submerged vane (fig. 1) is a measure for sediment management in alluvial rivers that has
shown good performance in both laboratory tests and field applications. The sediment
control capacity of a submerged vane is related to its dimension and shape. So far, most of
the vanes used in field applications are rectangular plates, mainly due to its simplicity to
manufacture and construct. Some sophisticated designs tested in laboratory studies have
airfoil-like cross-sectional profiles (Spoljaric, 1986; Ouyang, 2001; Ouyang, et al., 2006) and
even with shapes similar to a propeller that twisted from the base to the top (Spoljaric, 1986).
Although these complicated designs have shown good performance in laboratory tests, they
are however not very popular in field applications due to their high costs for manufacturing.
The flat-plate types of vanes still prevail. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
effect of varying the dimension and shape of a flat-plate vane on the vane-induced transverse
bed profile. Three types of vanes were studied: (1) the rectangular-plate with various height
and length, (2) a trapezoidal plate with the distance between the leading edge and the trailing
edge decreasing linearly from the base of the vane to the top, and (3) a plate of parallelogram
with its top swept forward or backward to the approaching flow.

THEORY
A submerged vane with initial height of 0H and length of L installed vertically on the
centerline of a straight channel with movable bed is considered (fig. 1). The vane is with a
small angle of  to the approaching flow. The depth-averaged flow velocity approaching
the vane is u . The channel bed is initially flat with depth of 0d prior to the installation of
the vane. The longitudinal sediment transport is considered in equilibrium state and only the
vane-induced transverse movement of the bed material is in concern.
The Lifting Panel Method in Wing Theory is utilized in the calculation of the
3superposition, the vane-induced flow field under the boundary effects is calculated by
summing up the velocity components induced by the vortex ring systems coating the real
vane and all the vane images. Along with the oncoming flow to the vane, the velocity field
around the vane is as shown in the following equation.

The vane-induced transverse bed shear stress distribution bn is calculated by employing
Rozovskii’s (1961) assumption that the near bed transverse velocity component bv is to have
the same ratio to the streamwise near bed velocity component bu as the transverse bed shear
stress bn to the streamwise bed shear stress bs . The transverse depth profile in a channel
cross-section associated to the transverse bed shear stress induced by the vane is calculated by
employing Odgaard and Wang’s (1991) bend flow model. The equation reads

where  is critical Shields stress of the bed material;  is specific weight of submerged
sediment defined as  /)( s ; s is density of sediment; D is median grain diameter;
B is a function of Coulomb’s friction and ratio of lift force to drag force for a bed particle.
Value of B is reported between 3 and 6 (Ikeda and Nishimura, 1985).
A numerical procedure is developed to solve Eq. (1) to (3) for the calculation of the
vane-induced flow field and the associated transverse bed profile. The computation of the
depth profile is performed starting at the center of the channel. The initial flow depth at the
starting point is set equal to the cross-sectional averaged water depth 0d , and the transverse
depth profile is calculated along a cross-section of the channel from the starting point toward
both banks. The flow discharge is checked after the calculation of the depth profile. If the
continuity of the discharge is not satisfied, a new starting flow depth is selected and the
process is repeated until a stopping criterion is fulfilled.
5Rectangular vane
In applications, most of the vanes used are generally flat plates with shapes of rectangle.
The heights of the vanes found in literatures have ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 water-depths and the
lengths of the vanes from 1.0 to 4.0 water-depths. No specific guidelines have been
provided for the determination of these dimensions. The model is employed to investigate
the relation between the vane’s dimension and its sediment control capacity. As depicted in
fig. 4, a rectangular vane installed at the centerline of a straight channel with movable bed is
studied. The channel bed is considered initially leveled with depth of 0d prior to the
installation of the vane. The performance of the vane is evaluated by the normalized
increase in bed level at the channel bank after installing the vane, 00 /)( ddd v , where vd
is water depth at the channel bank after installation of the vane, as shown in fig. 4.
Fig. 4. Definition sketch for a submerged vane and the vane-induced bed profile
in a straight channel
Fig. 5 presents the relation between the normalized vane-height and the near-bank bed
level change induced by the vane for different DF values defined as gDu / to measure
the mobility of the bed material (Odgaard and Wang, 1991). As shown, for all DF values,
the vane-induced change in near-bank bed level 00 /)( ddd v increases with increasing
vane-height when 00 / dH is lower than about 0.65, while oppositely, when 00 / dH is
higher than 0.65, 00 /)( ddd v decreases with increasing vane-height. When
65.0/ 00 dH , the vane-induced bed level change reaches maxima. The sediment Froude
number is seen having little effect on the optimal value of 0.65 water-depths for the
vane-height. This is a favorable result in terms of vane design because the sediment Froude
number represents the flow and sediment conditions which are usually quite different for
natural rivers. It is also seen in the figure that the vane induces larger bed level changes
when the DF value is higher. This is physically reasonable because the bed materials with
larger sediment Froude number have higher tendency to be moved by the vane-induced
transverse bed shear stress.

Tapered vane
The possibility of improving the vane’s sediment control capacity is further investigated
by considering simple shape modifications of the rectangular vane without much complexity
in terms of application feasibility in practical situations. A‘tapered vane’illustrated in fig. 8
is considered. The tapered vane has a vane-length decreasing linearly from the base to the
top with a straight quarter-length line vertical to the base. A taper-ratio, , is introduced to
measure the degree of taper for the vane. The taper-ratio is defined as bt LL / , where
tL and bL are vane-lengths at the top and the base of the vane, respectively. Value of 
is less than 1 for a tapered vane.
Fig. 8. Definition sketch of a tapered vane
A rectangular vane with 0/ dL = 1.0 and the associated optimal vane-height 00 / dH =
0.65 is selected as the baseline shape for the modifications. The height of the vane remains
unchanged as same as the baseline shape. The length of the vane is varying associated to the
value of  such that the surface area of the vane remains constant.
Fig. 9 shows the near-bank bed level change 00 /)( ddd v induced by the first type of
tapered vane as a function of  for different angles of incidence. As shown, the
9baseline shape has the same length and height as the baseline rectangular vane (and thus the
same surface area). Fig. 11 gives the near-bank bed level change 00 /)( ddd v induced by a
swept vane with  varies from -0.5 to 0.5. It appears that the performance of the vane
improves with decreasing . Since 0 designates the baseline rectangular vane and
0 the forward-swept vane, this indicates that the performance of the rectangular vane
can be further improved with a forward-swept outline. It is also seen in the figure that when
 is larger than 0, the induced bed-level change is lower than that of  = 0. This
indicates that a back-swept shape will deteriorate the vane’s performance and is therefore not
suggested for shape modification. For different , as the figure shows, the swept outline is
seen having more evident effect on the vane’s performance when the vane is under higher
angle of incidence.

CONCLUSIONS
A method for the calculation of the transverse bed profile induced by a single submerged
vane is described. The model is utilized to investigate the effects of a vane’s dimension and
shape on its performance in sediment control capacity. For a rectangular vane, studies show
that the optimal vane-height is related to the length of the vane and is within a rather small
range of 0.58 –0.70 water-depths. A design chart for the determination of the optimal
vane-height associated to the vane-length is provided as a guideline for vane design. Two
categories of shape modifications based on the simple flat-plate rectangular vane were studied:
(1) the tapered vane, and (2) the swept vane. For the tapered vane, the results show that,
under the constraint of constant surface area, the performance of the vane can be further
improved by a tapered shape with the height of the vane remains unchanged. For the swept
vane, the results show that the performance of the vane with its top swept forward to the

2Figure 1 Schematic showing submerged vane and induced bed profile.
Since the area of streambed affected by a single vane is limited, for applications, usually a
number of vanes are installed in parallel to widen the effective area. For these vanes to work
together, the distance between the vanes can not be too large. However, if the spacing between the
vanes is too small, the vanes will interact to each other. The interaction between the vanes interferes
with the development of the vane-induced circulations and consequently reduces the efficiency of
the vane system. It is the main purpose of this study to investigate this phenomenon of vane-
interaction and also its effects on the vane-induced transverse bed profile.
The paper first describes a new approach for modeling the interaction between an array of
vanes. The developed model was verified by measured data obtained from laboratory flume tests.
Two factors involved in vane-interaction were investigated: (1) the height-to-length ratio of the
vanes, and (2) the lateral spacing between the vanes.
2. THEORY
A row of N equal sized vanes with heights of iH and length of L installed vertically on the bed
along a channel cross-section with an angle of  to the flow is considered. Fig. 2 gives a schematic
plot of the vane array. In most applications, a vane-array is usually located within a small portion of
area in a channel cross-section, close to the concave bank in most cases. For simplicity, it is
assumed that the variations of the direction and magnitude of the flow approaching to each of the
vanes in the vane-array are negligible, i.e., the vanes are under about the same flow conditions.

By solving the equation system, the interaction coefficient for each of the vanes in a vane
array can be obtained.
3. TRANSVERSE DEPTH DISTRIBUTION INDUCED BY A VANE ARRAY
The transverse depth profile in a cross section of a fully developed channel bend has been given by
Odgaard and Wang (1991a). The equation reads
6Figure 3 Layout for Wang’s (1991) movable-bed test.
In all simulation runs, the parameters B and k for the model are set equal to 4 and 1
respectively, as suggested by Odgaard et al. (1991a). Fig. 4 gives the measured data and the
calculated depth profiles for the tests. It is seen that the calculations of the vane-induced bed
topography are generally in agreement with the measured data. The measured bed elevations in the
vane field are somewhat higher than that of the estimation. This might due to the increase of the
streamwise component of bed shear stress resulted by the vane-induced drag, which is however not
accounted for in this model.

Figure 5 Interaction coefficients for a three-vane array ( 5.0/0 LH )
As seen in Eq.(8), the effectiveness of a vane is also related to its height and length. Fig. 6
gives the variation of the effectiveness ratio 12 / for a three-vane array as a function of the
relative vane dimension LH /0 and the normalized vane spacing L/ . Two types of vanes with
3.0/0 LH and 5.0/0 LH are investigated. As the figure shows, it appears that the variations of
12 / for both types of vanes are quite similar, indicating that 12 / is not strongly related to
LH /0 . Little discrepancy can be observed in the figure though. It is seen that when L/ is larger
than about 0.5, the effectiveness ratio 12 / for a vane array with 5.0/0 LH is a little higher than
that of vanes with 3.0/0 LH . However, the result reverses when L/ is smaller than about 0.5,
12 / for vanes with 5.0/0 LH is lower than that of 3.0/0 LH . It follows that for vanes
within the working range of vane spacing 5.1~6.0/ L , a vane array with relative dimension
5.0/0 LH would be a little efficient than a vane array with 3.0/0 LH . The difference is
however not very significant.

6. CONCLUSIONS
A new approach for the calculation of the interaction between a row of submerged vanes is
described. Studies on a three-vane array show that the effectiveness for the vanes in the array all
decrease with decreasing lateral spacing. The decreasing rate for the effectiveness of the vane at the
middle of the array is much higher than that of the two outlying vanes. When L/ is smaller than
about 0.6, the function of the middle vane has dropped down to less than half of its full function.
Studies also show that the interaction coefficients, which represent the effectiveness of the vanes,
are strongly related to the normalized vane spacing L/ . On the other hand, the relation between
the interaction coefficients and the relative vane dimension LH /0 is less significant. Because of
the variation of the interaction coefficients, the appropriate working range of L/ for a vane array
is about 0.6 to 1.5. Within this range, the vanes could work together as a whole to generate a
coherent vortex downstream without strong interaction emerging that degrades the efficiency of the
vanes. Bed profile simulations show that vane interaction undermines the vanes’ sediment control
capability. Ignoring vane interaction in bed profile calculations might lead to unrealistic results that
overestimate the performance of the vanes and even result in a poor design that some of the vanes in
the array having very little function and are actually redundant.
