22. Introduction
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a
material that widely used in biomaterial
research and in broad number of medical
devices. Thin PDMS membranes have been
used to support monolayer cell adhesion and
to transmit mechanical force in the form of
bioaxial stain. This ability of PDMS
membrane enhances the materials clinical
usefulness and allows one to study
cell-surface interactions in detail. However, a
disadvantage of these procedures is that the
material often has hydrophobic surface
properties which results in poor cell adhesion.
Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the
possibility of modifying a hydrophilic film on
silicon for further study of cell-biomaterials
interactions.
Previous reported surface modification
methods for PDMS include (1) to promote
crosslinking by gelatin-glutaralhehyde (2) to
integrate functional groups by plasma
treatments, and (3) to increase cellular
adhesion to polymers. The increment of
crosslinking produces about 100 microns thin
film which is too thick to preserve any
micro-nanostructures that have been designed
into the surface. On the other hand, plasma
treatment resulted in a high quality thin film..
Cellular adhesion to polymers has been
enhanced by modifying the surface of
substrates with attached extracellular-matrix
proteins which provide cell attachment sites,
and act as reservoirs for soluble signaling
molecules.
In this research paper, the plasma
treatments were employed to enhance the
adhesion of biomolecules on PDMS
membranes. In order to examine the effects
of activation and functionalization of plasmas,
PDMS membranes were characterized by
XPS, water contact angle, SEM and AFM for
the membranes treated by O2, and CF4
plasmas respectively. FITC-BSA was
immobilized membranes either untreated or
treated by plasmas in order to examine the
interactions between membranes and
biomolecules.
3. Materials and methods
3.1Material
The PDMS samples for plasma
treatments were prepared as following: the
Polydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184 ®
elastomer , Dow Corning–Midland,MI,USA)
solution and its curing agent were mixed as
10:1(v/v) ratio. The mixed solution was
degassed in vacuum chamber to ensure well
mixing and to remove air bubbles. The mixed
solution was then spin coated on 11 cm2
silicon wafer disc and the samples were then
heated at 150 oC for 15min for curing.
FTIC-BSA (Fluorescein isothiocyanate
conjugate - Bovine Serum Albumin) (Sigma)
was used directly without further purification.
All solution were made with deionized water
(18Mcm)y. The purity of gases used for
plasma treatments (O2 and CF4) are higher
than 99.9%.
3.2 Plasma equipment
Figure 1. shows schematically the
plasma configurations used in the present
study. The plasma is composed by three main
parts: (1) reaction chamber; (2)
radio-frequency generator; and (3) vacuum
system. The samples were directly mounted
on a round stainless steel electrode powered
by a 13.56MHz rardio-frequency power
supply. Process gases (O2, CF4) were
introduced into the reaction chamber by a
mass flow system. The gas flow was adjusted
between 10-50sccm depending on the
conditions required for the plasma treatments.
The total pressure was controlled from
50~100mTorr.

4On the other hand, for the PDMS treated
by oxygen plasma, the total surface energy
increases form 17.6 (mJ/m2) to 29.17 (mJ/m2)
for 10 seconds of treatment by the power of
10W. The total surface can increase up to 50
(mJ/m2) for 300 seconds of treatment. For
higher voltage, 150W, of oxygen plasma, the
total surface energy increases up to 45.4
(mJ/m2) within 10 seconds of treatment and
reaches a plateau of 42.0 (mJ/m2) after 30
seconds. These results show that the surfaces
of PDMS stay hydrophobic by CF4 plasma
for different applied power. The oxygen
plasma, on the other hand, brought the
hydrophilicity onto the surfaces therefore the
total surface energy increase markedly.
4.2 Surface composition
The surface chemical composition
analyses of plasma treated and untreated
PDMS membranes were carried out using
XPS. The wide scan spectrum demonstrated
the total compositions on the surfaces; on the
other hand, the decomposition of the spectra
of C1s peak provides the information of the
chemical bindings.
For the PDMS treated by CF4 plasma,
Fig.4 shows the wide scan and the integration
of fluorine can be clearly seen to increase
from 0 to 47.5% and 47.6% by 5 minutes of
10W and 150W CF4 treatments, respectively.
This indicates that the different applied
power (10W and 150W) have same effect on
fluorination. Both oxygen content and Si
content both increase by 10W and 150W
applied power. This could be due to that the
higher energy can promote the dissociation of
oxygen and Si atoms from the substrates.
Fig.3 XPS wide scan spectra of PDMS
membranes by CF4 plasma.
The FITC-BSA was immobilized onto
the plasma treated PDMS right after the
plasma operation. According to the wide scan,
the nitrogen component can be attributed to
the amino acid compositions of BSA proteins
and this can be increased from 0 to 4.6% for
both 10W and 150W power of CF4 plasma.
To investigate the incorporation of
FITC-BSA, from wide scan analyses, the
untreated PDMS shows no content of N
elements. However, for the 10W and 150W
CF4 plasma treated membranes, the increase
of nitrogen elements can be observed from
0% to 4.61% and 4.66% respectively. This
can indicate the adhesion of FITC-BSA on
the membranes.

spectra of PDMS membranes. (a) PDMS

4.3 Surface morphology
The surface morphology and
roughness can be analyzed by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). The roughness for the
untreated PDMS is 0.29nm and this could be
increased by 10W CF4 plasma treatment
(0.532 nm) and more drastically (2.24 nm) by
higher power (150W) CF4 plasma treatment
(Table3).
