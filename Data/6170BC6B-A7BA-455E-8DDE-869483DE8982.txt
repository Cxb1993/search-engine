一、中文摘要 
 
    The color combination suggestions deducted 
from the single average of user preference scores 
might not be appropriate because different people 
might prefer different color combinations.  For 
this reason, this study tried to verify that the 
degrees of rating consistence between subjects 
are various for different icon-background color 
combinations.  The standard deviation of each 
color combination is calculated to judge the 
rating consistence between subjects for each 
color combination. Cluster analysis with 
nonhierarchical procedures is used to categorize 
the color combinations by the clustering variables, 
both standard deviations of legibility and 
aesthetic rating.  The results showed that the 
degree of rating consistence between subjects 
was low for most color combinations because the 
means of standard deviations for aesthetics and 
legibility were higher for most color 
combinations.  In addition, the results suggested 
that there are 65 color combinations which are 
appropriate to be used as default icon-background 
color combinations for skinning interfaces 
because these color combinations had higher 
rating consistence and with higher legibility and 
aesthetic scores.

二、緣由與目的 
 
Hand-held electronic products with small screens 
had become popular due to the convenience of 
carrying them and easy storage.  The small 
screen of the hand-held electronic products also 
restricts the amount of display information.  
When compared with text, icons lead to better 
recall, faster recognition [1].  Besides, another 
advantage of icons is their compactness.  They 
occupy less space than texts on the screen.  
Therefore, icons were extensively used in the 
Hand-held electronic products with small screens.  
However, Most researches about the effects of 
color combinations concentrates on 
text-background color combination (e.g., [2], [3], 
[4], [5]), while few studies considered 
icon-background color combination. An example 
of the latter was that of Huang [6] considers the 
use of color, one of the design elements, to 
compensate for the degraded legibility caused by 
the reduction in size of small icons. His findings 
suggested that the higher Luminance Contrast 
could promote icon legibility, but not the icon 
chromaticity or background chromaticity.  
 However, he did not discuss the aesthetic 
effects on color combination.  Aesthetics of 
color combination was also an important factor 
influencing users to choice the screen interface.  
Therefore, Shieh and Ko [7] used preference 
rating to explore the effects of target/background 
color combination on icon design. Their results 
indicated black targets (black-on-white, 
black-on-yellow) and black backgrounds 
(red-on-black, yellow-on-black) were the most 
popular.  As for the chromatic color 
combinations, yellow-on-blue was the most 
favored.  Besides, Camgoz, Yener & Guvenc [8], 
who explored the preference responses for 
figure/ground color combinations, and found that 
colors with maximum saturation and brightness 
were most preferred, and that blue was the most 
preferred hue.  Obviously, their results were not 
consistent with Shieh and Ko [7].  The author 
argued that aesthetic preferences were highly 
personal factors, with a large variation between 
users. Possibly, for some icon-background color 
combinations, users might have highly consistent 
aesthetic rating scores, but for the other color 
combinations whose rating scores might be not 
consistent between users.  The suggestions [7, 8] 
might not be appropriate when deducted from the 
single average of user aesthetic preference scores.  
Therefore, this study tried to verify the argument 
that the subject aesthetic rating was the same as 
each other for some icon-background color 
combination, but not for all color combinations. 
 Besides, legibility and aesthetics were the 
two different attributes for icon-background color 
combinations.  Legibility refers to the ease with 
which the icons can be detected and 
discriminated from one another.  Legibility of 
icons depends on the degree of icon visibility 
which can be promoted by appropriate color 
combinations.  Aesthetics is a strong 
determinant of the pleasure the user experiences

300°; the values of the 3 kinds of saturation were 
33%, 66%, and 99%; the values of the 3 kinds of 
brightness were 33%, 66%, and 99% in the HSB 
color space. 
Sixteen icons were arranged horizontally in 
line in a rectangle (around 45mm height and 
142mm width) on the center of LCD display 
modeled CMV CT-736D.  The color outside the 
rectangle was black.  The colors were assigned 
randomly to the icons and the rectangle as 
icon-background color combinations. The length 
of the sixteen icons was 88mm.  The height of 
each icon was 6mm.  The distance between the 
screen and subjects’ eye was 100cm. The visual 
angle was 20.63 min of arc, which was larger 
than 15 min of visual arc recommended by 
Cushman and Rosenberg [10]. 
 The computer modeled as HP Workstation 
XW4200 was used to control the experiment 
procedure; and the experimental material is 
programmed with Director 8.0.    The ambient 
room illuminance was low (about 43 lux at 
observers’ seats). 
 3) Tasks and Procedures: Subjects 
performed subjective rating for each color 
combination showed on the LCD display. There 
were two screen pages for each color 
combination.  The first page and the second 
page ask subjects to rate the aesthetic preference 
and legibility, respectively, for the color 
combination shown in the pages.  The rating 
categories, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, were 
presented on the bottom of the display screen.  
-3 means strong disagreement; 3 means strong 
agreement.  The program encoded the ratings 
with scores -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
 There were 58 colors used in the experiment.  
Therefore, subjects had to rate 3306 (58×57) 
color combinations.  The 3306 color 
combinations were divided into 29 sections. The 
sequence of color combinations displayed on the 
screen was randomized.  There were 114 color 
combinations in each section.  Familiarization 
was based on an additional section with extra 114 
color combinations used as a practice section not 
included in the 3306 color combinations.  
Therefore, there were 30 sections in the 
experiment.  Subjects had to perform 5 sections 
per days.  The first section in the first day was 
the practice section.  After subjects finished one 
section, the computer would ask the subjects to 
take a break.  Ten minutes later, the researcher 
asked the subjects to perform the next section.  
After subjects finished the fifth section, the 
researcher asked the subjects to come next day.  
Next day, the subjects performed the tasks with 
the procedure which was the same as the first day.  
Therefore, a subject need spend six days to finish 
the whole experiment. 
 
 
四、結果與討論 
  To understand the degree of subject rating 
consistence for each color combination, 
sequential threshold method of nonhierarchical 
clustering procedures was used to categorize the 
color combinations with the clustering variables,

included 2.3291% of the number of color 
combinations. That is, there were few color 
combinations which have extremely lower rating 
consistence or extremely higher rating 
consistence between subjects. 
In addition, the results also indicated that the 
degrees of rating consistence between subjects 
are various for different color combinations 
because the standard deviation ranges from 
0.4503 to 1.071 for aesthetics and from 0.3746 to 
0.9592 for legibility, and the number of color 
combinations of clusters decrease as their 
positions far away from the C15. This study 
standardized the rating scores for each subject 
with mean=0 and SD=1.  It means that there are 
68.26% color combinations whose standardized 
scores are located between -1 and 1 for each 
subject.  The means of standard deviations 
(0.7795 and 0.6683, for aesthetics and legibility, 
respectively) of C15, the center of the 28 clusters, 
are close to 1, the standardized standard deviation 
in this study.  Therefore, the results implied that 
the degree of rating consistence between subjects 
was low for most color combinations because the 
means of both standard deviations for aesthetics 
and legibility were higher for most color 
combinations. Therefore, the previous research 
suggestions deducted from the single average of 
user aesthetic preference scores might not be 
appropriate for the application of color 
combinations. 
Besides, the high degree of rating consistence 
for a specific color combination does not mean 
that it gets a high rating score.  Therefore, the 
color combinations in C1 and C3, whose rating 
scores were the most consistent, were categorized 
into five groups and plotted in fig. 4 by clustering 
variables, both rating scores of legibility and 
aesthetics.  The within STD was 0.14272; the 
R-Square 0.979016.  Table 2 shows the both 
means of legibility and aesthetic ratings for the 
five clusters   In addition to higher rating 
consistence, the color combinations within 
clusters on the top right had higher legibility and 
aesthetic rating scores than those on the bottom 
left, shown in fig. 4.  Therefore, the 65 color 
combinations on CC5 were more suitable than 
those on the bottom left to be used as the 
icon-background of the screen design.  
Furthermore, skinning design is extensively used 
in interface design, e.g. Windows Media Player 
and Winamp.  The skinning interface allows 
users to change the look and feel of a system at 
runtime.  It might be appropriate to use one of 
the 65 color combinations on CC5 as a default 
color combination because the 65 color 
combinations on CC5 have higher rating 
consistence among subjects

most consistent color combinations which were categorized 
by both means of legibility and aesthetics rating scores.  
The larger circle of the cluster means the larger amount of 
color combinations included in it 
 
 The results showed the various degrees of 
rating consistence between subjects for different 
color combinations.  The reason for this 
phenomenon might be that there was a mediator 
variable, the affective factor affecting subjective 
judgments for the color combinations.  When a 
color combination is presented, one perceives not 
only the features of the color combination, but 
also the semantic meanings of the color 
combinations.  Different people prefer different 
semantic meanings appeared from the color

Abstract: A necessary condition for product success is that a product offers satisfied needs to customers. Although several
authors believe that the scenario-building method was helpful in getting innovative products, their articles did not clearly
describe the steps of the scenario-building method for elicitation of customer needs in the process of the product development.
Therefore, the present paper will develop a scenario-building model which describes the stages of the scenario-building
method to identify the customers’problems and requirements on the product planning phase of the product development
process. The proposed scenario-building model includes seven stages. The first stage is to describe the target user groups by
reviewing literatures related to the life style of target users. The second stage is to fathom the activities of the whole day for
the target users according to their life style. The third stage is to create the stories with future life style according to users
possible activities proposed in the second stage. In this stage, the forged stories should also consider the future markets,
technologies and regulatory. The fourth stage is to play the forged stories made up on the third stage. In this stage, designers
play the stories by themselves in order to percept potential user needs. The fifth stage is to collect the user potential needs
found from the performance of the fourth stage. The sixth stage is to systematize the needs collected from the stage 5. The last
stage is to evaluate the importance of all the user needs. Next, a design project will be performed according to the
scenario-building model to exam its effectiveness. The outcomes show that the model can be effective to promote the
creativity of user need elicitation.
1. INTRODUCTION
To increase the product competency, the developed product should satisfy customer potential needs which can create
innovation values. Usually, these customer potential needs are the needs that are not aware of by markets but are highly
accepted when they are satisfied (Kim & Mauborgne, 2005). Traditionally, the potential customer needs can be discovered
from customer observation and customer interviews. However, customers can never say they want a truly innovative product
they have never even imagined before. Therefore, it is not wise to elicit customer needs only from customer opinions.
Besides, publications, the company records, company sales force or the service personnel who maintain and repair products,
or competing product analysis are also the sources for the need elicitation. However, these sources which imply some current
user needs only propose the needs which are known already and have no much difference from current products. That is
possible the reason why designers still have difficulties to create an innovative product according to traditional approaches of
need elicitation. Therefore, the present paper tries to use a new approach, scenario-building, to explore customer potential
needs.
1.1 What are scenarios?
Basically, the scenario is a fictional story with characters, events and environments. Nardi (1992) defined a scenario as a
description of a set of users, a work context and a set of tasks that users perform or want to perform. The scenario building
means the development of a series of alternative fictional stories. Scenario building was used in interactive design to capture
requirement and model tasks extensively. Some authors also discussed the application of scenarios to find out the solutions of
product design. For example, Suri and Marsh (2000) proposed that the process of scenario building begins by identifying the
Figure 1. A model of ASEN.
2.1 Stage 1: Describing the Target User Groups
The first stage is to describe the target user groups by reviewing literatures related to the life style of target users. Different
types of customers acting different types of behaviors will produce different product needs. Designers have to study the
characteristics of target user groups to understand target users deeply because designers are not the target users usually. Two
steps are used to describe the target users groups. First, the customer characteristics are collected from the customer lifestyles
which are searched from literatures (including newspaper, journal papers, thesis or dissertation, etc.), interviews and
observations. These customer characteristics are sorted and listed by the topics of customer personal characteristics, beliefs
and motivations, personality, and self concept. In this step, customer characteristics are listed with verbal descriptions.
The next step is to visually imagine the characteristics listed in the first step with customer image boards showing the
customer characteristics with photo pictures. In this step, designers are asked to express customer characteristics with visual
images because visual images are better than verbal descriptions of customer characteristics for several reasons. First, visual
images make design team members experience the user characteristics more directly than verbal texts. Second, visual images
facilitate every one in design team to communicate with each other. Last is not least, the visual image boards are helpful to
designers to create physical forms of products for the later step of product development process.
Figure 2. Image boards.
There are three types of image boards. The photos on Activity boards show how customers spend their time; the photos
on Interest boards show what customers enjoy doing; the photos on Opinions boards show what customers think of people,
places, and things. The outcomes of these three boards for the racket design project are shown on Figure 2.
There are two outcomes on this stage. The first outcome is a set of characters created to personify the range of critical
characteristics listed according to customer personal characteristics, motivations beliefs and motivations, personality, and self
concept. To ensure anthropometric fit, the set of characters is created commonly by using extreme situation, rather than
averages (Suri & Marsh, 2000). The descriptions of one of the characters for the racket design project are shown on Figure 3.
The second outcome is a list of conjectured design directions regarding the customer characteristics by using designer
imagination and reasoning ability. Conjecturing design directions is a creative activity. The direction of potential needs
suggests design orientations which the designers have to follow.
pictures can efficaciously stimulate designer imaginations and associations and find out more problems or needs. Third, not
all the designers can draw an illustration well and easily.
Then, the team members‘walkthrough’the stories, using these photo storyboards, after the stories are decided. The
stories are played with extemporization. When designers walk through the stories, they have to consider the rationality of
customer activities in the real world with an imaginative futuristic look at how technology could support those activities, how
regularity could limit these activities and how market environments change customer behaviors. Designers are encouraged to
act the process of walking through, not only use pens-and-pencils to go through the story.
2.5 Stage 5: collecting the user potential needs
This stage is to collect the user potential needs found from the performance of the fourth stage. During the story playing in
last stage, the story-playing team including three designers at least performs brainstorming activities. Beside, one of team
members has to describe and act the behaviors of the leading character; another person have to take pictures to record the
potential problems, or needs, the leading character will encounter; the other one have to write down the problems, or needs,
found from the story-playing. All the problems, or needs, are written in small cards. Only one problem or need is written on
one card. The words written during the process of story-playing may be not clear because all team members are busy on
role-playing, photo-taking, problem-recording and discussing. Therefore, the designers need to reword those findings into
need statements. The rules of rewording the problems, or needs, are following the five guidelines proposed by Ulrich and
Eppinger (2000). These reworded statements are written in small cards. One need statement is written on one card only.
Next, designers have to discern the need statements to eliminate the identical statements appearing before. The cards
with need statements are averagely distributed to each team member. The team leader takes out a card and read the contents.
All the team members have to find out cards with identical written needs. And they put the cards in a stack. Sometimes, the
meaning of the written need on the cards hold on the team members is not exactly the same as the one read by the team leader.
It means that the written need involves two, or more, needs. The new needs have to be written down to replace the original
one. One need is written on one card only. And put the card which written need is the same as the one read by the team leader
into the stack. This job goes on until no one is holding cards. Finally, there is only one need description for each stack. There
is only a card selected form each stack. The rest cards are discarded. Therefore, the redundant cards are eliminated
2.6 Stage 6: systematizing the needs
This stage will systematize the needs from the stage 5 by executing the card-sorting task. They discern the need statements to
categorize these selected cards systematically. The cards are averagely distributed to each one in the story-playing team. The
team leader takes out a card and read the contents. All the team members have to find out cards with similar written needs.
And they put the cards in a stack. This task goes on until no one is holding cards. Therefore, designers create a two-level
hierarchical tree. Then, designers name each stack to express the common meaning of the cards in the stack. In this case, the
stack names are primary needs and the stack members are secondary needs. However, designers may consider creating
sub-stacks when the number of cards in each stack is more than five, and therefore a third level in the hierarchy. These needs
are finally structured in a hierarchical way. The hierarchy is helpful to identify possible missing needs.
2.7 Stage 7: Evaluating the importance of potential needs
This stage will evaluate the importance of all the customer potential needs. Designers may allocate more resources to resolve
the needs which are the most important in designing product. However, the hierarchical tree of needs does not provide any
information on the relative importance that customers place on different needs. Therefore, the importance weight of each
need is necessary for designers making decision in design product. The importance rating can be down either by target
customers or by design teams themselves. The time and money costs may increase when the customers are recruited to
perform the rating task. In this case, the designers rate the need importance by themselves. The rating task is performed in
accordance with the suggestion of Ulrich and Eppinger (2000). The range of the rating score is from 1 to 5. 1 means the needs
are the less desirable; 5 means those are the most desirable. When the standard deviation is too large for a specific need, this
need description will be proposed to discuss to discover why the designers do not have consistent opinions on this need.
