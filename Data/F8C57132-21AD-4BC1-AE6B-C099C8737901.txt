cal micelles formed by free C14TAB. In PDA-
DAC/SDS systems, the PDADAC/SDS com-
plexes which are most probably vesicles is three 
order magnitude larger than free SDS spherical 
micelles.2 Li et al. have studied PAA/ C16TAB 
systems by resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). 
Base on the relationship between macromolecular 
aggregate and RRS intensity. They studied the 
system with different PH value. And proposed the 
association process of PAA/ C16TAB system.3Lim 
et al. studied the PAA/ C16TAB system by PH 
meter. They found that PH value for the solution 
containing PAA and C16TAB together is less than 
solutions only have PAA or C16TAB. It indicates 
the PAA chains release hydrogen ions to bind 
with C16TAB.4 
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can 
monitor small heat change such as micellar heat 
effects in polymer/surfactant solutions. ITC can 
be used to extract thermodynamic properties as 
enthalpy (△H), Gibbs free energy(△G), en-
tropy (△S), and heat capacity (Cp). Also, it can 
found critical concentrations in surfactant solu-
tions or polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems such 
as critical micellization concentration (cmc), 
surfactants started to form micelle in solutions, 
critical aggregation concentration (cac), surfac-
tants started to bind with polymers, saturation 
concentration (Cs), polymers is full bonded with 
polymer/surfactant complexes, and second crit-
ical micelle concentration (Cm), the surfactant 
free micelle started to form in polymer solutions. 
Wang and Tam used ITC and light scattering to 
study dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide 
(C12TAB)/PAA system in different PAA degrees 
of neutralization (α) and in different salt con-
centration. The result showed that C12TAB have 
different binding mechanism with PAA in dif-
ferent α. Also, adding salts into the system fa-
vors the formation of free micelles, and de-
crease the binding of surfactants onto poly-
mers.5,6 
In our experiments, we use ITC to study the 
PAA/C14TAB system to find the critical concen-
trations and investigate the effect of PAA chain 
length in this system. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
  Materials. The PAA with Mw = 450000, 1800 
were obtained from Sigma Co. The PAA with 
Mw = 250000, 25000, 5000 were obtained from 
Wako Co. The C14TAB purity > 99% was ob-
tained from Sigma Co. Water was purified by 
double-distillation, and then followed by a PU-
RELAB (Maxima, Elga) purification system with 
resistivity better than 18.2 MΩ·cm. 
 Isothermal titration calorimetry. ITC 
(Thermometric, Sweden) comprises three parts: 
Thermal activity monitor (TAM), Lund syringe 
pump, and titration units. 
We add 3.00000 ± 0.00080 g 0.05 wt% PAA 
solution into the ampoule and control TAM tem-
perature in 25oC, then add C14TAB solution into 
250μl syringe. The temperature is controlled in 
30±0.1℃. In every figure we combined at least 
three times experimental data. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
In our research, we use ITC to find the heat 
change for the PAA/C14TAB interaction. Figure 1 
shows the experimental titration curve of ITC, the 
peak upwards shows exothermal. We can get the 
heat change data, which when every time the 
concentration of C14TAB changed, by integrating 
the peak area to the time. By the ITC experimen-
tal data, Ohta et al. derived the equation to calcu-
late the enthalpy change during the micellization 
process (∆Hm): 
 
∆Hm = �hMN − hS� ≡ ∆h1(m1 ≫ cmc) −
∆h1(m1 < 𝑐𝑚𝑐)                        (1)

lar weights ( PAA Mw = 450000, 250000, 25000, 
5000, 1800 g/mol ). And the critical concentra-
tions and thermodynamic properties for different 
PAA molecular weight at 25℃ are listed in Table 
1. At 25℃, we can find that the (∂hM/ ∂m1)T.P 
curve looks almost the same for PAA molecular 
weight from 25000 to 450000 g/mol, and their 
exothermic peak is also similar to each others. 
And the exothermic peak area is smaller for PAA 
molecular weight is 5000 g/mol, for PAA mole-
cular weight is 1800 g/mol we find the smallest 
exothermic peak area. But the Cs value does not 
have large difference. In additional, the transform 
of (∂hM/ ∂m1)T.P by forming free micelles be-
come flatter with the decrease of the PAA mole-
cular weight. When PAA molecular weight is

According to the above mentioned results can we 
know that, the PAA chain length will affect the 
process of forming PAA/C14TAB mixed-micelles. 
For the PAA molecular weight is 1800 g/mol, the 
chain length is too short to provide enough space 
for C14TAB micelles to form mixed-micelles. 
C14TAB can only bind onto PAA by monomers, 
forming clusters due to the electrostatic attraction. 
And that is why the exothermic area is much 
smaller than PAA with larger molecular weight. 
Another difference for the PAA molecular weight 
is 1800 g/mol to the lager molecular weight PAA 
is during forming the clusters, the C14TAB free 
micelles also started to form. Not like higher mo-
lecular weight PAA can tell two parts in 
C14TAB/PAA mixed-micelles forming and in 
forming C14TAB free micelles. 
Adding PAA will affect the free micelle forma-
tion process. Comparing with pure C14TAB 
(∂hM/ ∂m1)T.P curve, the transform rate become 
smaller, showing the process for C14TAB form 
monomers change to micelles takes longer. And 
the shorter the polymer chain, the obvious can we 
see the effect. 
 
4. Conclusion 
From ITC experiment, an exothermal interaction 
in PAA/C14TAB system can be found. The inte-
raction is mainly attributed to the electrostatic 
attraction and hydrophobic properties between 
PAA and C14TAB. PAA will affect the free mi-
celle formation process, and PAA chain length 
takes an important role to the mixed-micelles 
forming process. We cannot define Cm for the 
PAA molecular weight is smaller than 5000g/mol. 
And for the PAA molecular weight is 1800 g/mol, 
the polymer chain is too short to form the 
mixed-micelles complex, C14TAB can only bind 
PAA with monomers.

24日結束，前後 2天在越南胡志明市的 Rex Hotel舉行。 
本會議主要是東南亞國家協會(ASEAN)會員國在化工相關的
盛會，由於此次主辦者之一 Prof. Pham Thanh Quan為百科大學化工
學院院長為舊識，他出面邀請我參加，我自然是欣然與會。主要吸引
AUN/SEED-Net 亞洲會員國從事化工相關研究的學者專家熱情參與
的小型會議，論文發表總計有約 100 篇。按慣例採口頭報告(oral 
presentation)和論文海報展示(poster presentation)兩種型式。 
本會議的安排除六個 Keynote lectures以外，同時有三場口頭
報告演講並行方式進行。本次會議的六個 Keynote lectures為 
是由日本 Japan International Cooperation Agency所贊助的)。 
由於有三個演講同時進行，選擇自己喜歡的課題聆聽演講是
十分必要的，有時因為衝堂還得割捨部分演講，十分可惜。比方：新
加坡大學的楊昆霖教授的演講和我的演講時間完全一樣，以至於我無
法去聆聽他的演講，很可惜。與會期間，筆者就從頭至尾參與聆聽演
講。有些演講與筆者最近欲發展的研究方向相近，筆者獲益良多。 
       筆者在 23日下午有乙篇論文發表，採口頭方式，而該演講題
目 為 「 Micronization Of Organic Drug Mitotane By Using A 
Microemulsion System」，其內容為我們探討水溶性很低的有機藥物如: 
mitotane，我們運用一微乳液系統來製備微粒化的有機藥物 mitotane，
可增加表面積以促進溶解數率，我們同時討論界面活性劑含量對
mitotane再結晶的晶貌的影響。在報告過程中，引起廣泛的討論，尤
其是幾位研究領域相近的學者專家的詳細討論，其中越南百科大學化
工學院院長 Prof. Pham Thanh Quan對我們的結果非常感興趣，透過
這些討論，讓筆者對自己論文的優劣點，有更深入的瞭解，獲益良多。 
除自己論文發表外，筆者亦有機會與各方學者討論其海報展示
論文，獲益匪淺。大會在時間的安排上較緊湊，只可惜討論時間太短，
筆者無法將有興趣的論文一一與作者詳細討論，是一大遺憾。
