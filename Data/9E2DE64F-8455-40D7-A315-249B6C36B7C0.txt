2. 波音 737-800 案例分析 
2.1 波音 737-800 事件說明 
2000 年 10 月某日，一架波音 737-800 型機由國
外飛至台北中正機場。當日下午 6 時，台灣本島已進
入「象神」颱風暴風半徑內，中正機場為大風、大雨
之天氣情況，該機選擇中正機場 05 左跑道採用儀器
進場，於高度 500 呎時目視跑道；於無線電高度表
50 呎時，解除自動駕駛。塔台發布落地許可同時告
知相關資料：「使用跑道 05 左，風向 010 度，風速
21 浬/時，最大陣風 34 浬/時，氣壓值 1002 百帕」。
21：50：12 時刻，鼻輪著陸， 2 秒鐘後，兩主輪在
跑道 2,439 呎處偏出跑道進入右側草地，復於跑道
4,119 呎處返回跑道，鼻輪始終未曾偏出跑道道面。 
2.2 飛航資料處理結果分析 
首先從飛航資料中有關飛機狀態研判，圖一為波
音 737-800 案例姿態角變化圖，在落地前 60 秒，滾
轉角(Roll)與俯仰角(Pitch)並無太大改變，機首角
(Heading)則在最後 10 秒從 42 度轉至 50 度，再從 50
度降至 40 度；機身與 05 左跑道中心線（約 53 度）
先呈右側(面對機首)偏約 10 度，飛行員試圖將飛機頭
轉向跑道，等到機頭對正後，飛機卻在最後 5 秒鐘又
向右側偏約 10 度，導致飛機著陸(Touch Down;TD)
時機身是歪的，兩主輪偏出跑道。 
其次從估算之風速風向研判，圖二為波音
737-800 案例風速風向變化圖，其中 FDR 結果是求取
侧滑角後，直接由地速與空速求得，因此取樣頻率為
四秒鐘一筆;而估算(estimated) 結果是從 INS 經由
EKF 估算求取地速與風場，可降低高頻雜訊。兩種結
果皆顯示機著陸前 30 秒- 12 秒期間，風速是平穩的
遞減從 55 降至 45 海浬/時(knots)，但在最後 10 秒從
45 浬/時降至 30 浬/時，再從 30 浬/時升到 38 浬/時；
風向原本介於 5 度至 10 度間，但最後 5 秒鐘卻從正
10 度轉至負 10 度，最後 5 秒鐘側向風突然轉強。 
圖三為波音 737-800案例沿飛行軌跡之三維風速
風向變化圖，圖三下為垂直風變化圖，風場並無顯著
變化，因此該事件並非由垂直風引起。圖三上為平面
風變化圖，其中每一點為每一秒鐘平面風速風向估算
結果，在著陸(TD)前 9 秒鐘風速開始明顯變小，然而
前 4 秒鐘再突然轉強且風向改變。，，。 
最後從飛機之飛行操控方面研判，圖四為波音
737-800 案例飛機控制面變化圖，在落地前 70 秒，垂
直尾翼 (Stabilizer)與襟翼角(Flap)並無太大改變；由
於側風在最後 10 秒開始下降，飛行員打正方向舵角
(Rudder)，試圖使機身對正 05 左跑道中心線，等到機
頭對正後，最後 4 秒鐘側向風突然轉強，飛行員試圖
打負方向舵角，以改正側向風影響，仍無法修正過偏
的航跡角(Track Angle) 約 57 度，而機頭呈左側偏至
37 度落地。 
 
3. 橫向風切危害因子推導 
從以上探討得知，針對突然側向風改變，打方向
舵角以降低其影響是最簡單且最直接的操控方式，因
為飛機無其他如引擎等可用來控制側向飛行速度，因
此橫向風切危害因子之推導，設計上無法像 F-factor
一樣以動、位能的能量觀點來推導，必須從偏航角、
側滑角、方向舵操控角度等來做思考。 
3.1 飛機機身、飛行軌跡、與風場角度關係推導 
近地面的風，對於飛機起降的安全有直接的影
響，當飛機在側風中起降時，飛機除了向前運動外，
還會順著側風方向移動，如果不及修正就會偏離跑
道，但是在考慮維持進場軌跡，通常降落過程會維持
一個固定夾角，一般稱之為蟹行角(Crab Angle)，此
種降落方法則稱之為蟹行降落法，蟹行角的大小與地
面濕滑程度、方向舵操控效能等參數有關。在橫向的
運動行為中，在維持航跡角 χ (Tracking Angle)與蟹行
角時，我們可以參考圖五得到下列的關係式： 
wa ββψδψχ ++=+=    ，               (1) 
其中側滑角 β (Side Slip Angle)就是相對風的速度方
向與機身機軸夾角，側滑角 βa 是無風的速度方向與
機身機軸夾角，側滑角 βw 是側風導致的側滑角，飄
流角 δ (Drift Angle)定義為相對地的速度方向與機身
機軸夾角，方位角 Ψ (Heading Angle)定義成機身軸軸
與北方夾角(clockwise)，而航跡角 χ (Tracking Angle)
則代表飛機相對地面的速度方向與北方夾角。 
方向舵的操作原理是透過空氣在垂直尾翼上產
生力矩(Moment)，以改變偏航速率r(yaw rate)，使得
方向角得到改變。在固定的側風的環境中，飛機降落
時並不是以機頭對準跑道中心線，而是必需維持讓航
跡對準跑道中心線，假設預設的航跡角是χ r 
(Required Tracking Angle)，與目前的航跡角χ相差，
則須要修正的航跡角差
XCA
χ 就可以寫成下式： 
rrXCA
χδψχχχ −+=−=    。             (2) 
這個航跡角差不能大於飛機可以承受的最大偏離量
 maxχ ，否則飛機無法拉回跑道中心線。依據航機操
作手冊(Airplane Operations Manual; AOM)規定，一般
波音 737 受側風超過 36 海浬/時不得起降，溼跑道則
降至 30 海浬/時。假設一架波音 737 降落時速為 160
海浬/時，則  maxχ 為 o10160301 ≈−Sin 。 
XCA
χ 還可以分成兩部份，一部份是在近似常定

部份則為在空中必需改變的部份，例如航向校準對正

ABSTRACT 
 
In order to characterize the crosswind hazard, there is a 
need to develop an effective index that can suitably reflect 
the degree of the hazard. A Boeing 737-800 which was 
threatened by a crosswind was evaluated in this study based 
on a set of flight data recorder (FDR) data. The data 
consisted of Inertial Navigation System (INS) measurements, 
radio altitude, ground position and speed, drift angle, and air 
data. To determine these characteristics, the data were 
processed with using a 24-state extended-Kalman-filter 
(EKF) to reconstruct the wind profile along the flight path. 
The result shows that the wind speed started decreasing 30 
seconds before the landing and sharply decreased during the 
flare period while the wind direction changed rapidly during 
the final six seconds. The time histories of rudder and 
aileron controls were studied as well. The analysis indicates 
that sharp change in crosswind affects the pilot control. As a 
result, the airplane ran out of the runway after its landing but 
was able to taxi back. The derivation of a proposed 
crosswind hazard index called “Redundancy” based on 
rudder and sideslip angles was developed and tested. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
As generally known, the low-level windshear and 
turbulence poses a significant hazard to aircraft especially 
during landing period. In particular, appropriate flight 
control actions must be applied timely to ensure aircraft’s 
safety. To improve flight condition, hazard characterization 
and acceptable hazard index are quite important to provide 
pilot situational awareness and hence to prevent accident. 
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [1, 2] and 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) [3] has 
developed wind shear guidelines to educate the pilots on the 
procedures to identify and prevent windshear hazards. A 
useful parameter, adopted by FAA [2] and often quoted for 
indicating the severity of windshear and vertical wind on the 
aircraft performance, is the F-Factor. However, studies 
conducted to determine this threshold are mostly based on 
longitudinal parameters and the lateral components are less 
considered. The previous results [4] show that this parameter 
is not adequate when the external wind speed and/or 
direction vary rapidly. To characterize the crosswind hazard, 
there is a need to develop an effective index that can suitably 
reflect the degree of the hazard. The derivation of a proposed 
crosswind hazard index called “Redundancy” based on 
rudder and sideslip angles has been developed and tested in 
this study. The index reflects the tolerance margin of lateral 
hazard due to crosswind. 
 
In this paper, a studied case for the lateral hazard due to 
crosswind is a twin-engine jet airplane in a landing incident 
occurred on October 31, 2000. The airplane was heading to 
the Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) international airport near Taipei 
in Taiwan for landing [5]. Prior to the incident, a Significant 
Weather Information (SIGMET) on hazardous weather was 
issued. The CKS weather at the time was poor with strong 
wind and heavy rain because of Xangsane typhoon. 
However, the visibility was good enough for an instrument 
landing system (ILS) approach.  
 
Due to a strong crosswind at the final several seconds in 
flare, the aircraft slipped off the runway after touchdown. 
The Aviation Safety Council (ASC) in Taiwan, in its final 
report [5] on the incident, indicated that autopilot was 
disconnected at a low altitude. As a result, it did not allow 
the pilot sufficient time to gain complete control over the 
aircraft. The flight crew applied a large rudder angle and 
tried to decrease the crab angle. However a loss of 
directional control was experienced near grounding. 
 
The FDR data of the airplane has been analyzed. As far 
as the data compatibility is concerned, the EKF approach is 
applied to the data set to check data consistency and data 
error terms. The estimated state includes the sideslip angle, 
three body angular rates and winds along a flight trajectory. 
Finally, the refined parameters and improved wind profile 
are used to analyze the hazard behavior of the B-737 
affected by wind shear [6, 7, and 8].

 As for the estimated wind field, it can be expressed in 
terms of the head wind Wx, crosswind Wy, and vertical wind 
Wz respectively. It also can be simplified as the horizontal 
wind speed horwV _ , and wind direction wψ  [4]. The 
information is applied to wind shear identification. The 
information is also recorded in FDR with less sampling rate.  
 
Table 1 shows the comparison of the estimated wind 
profiles along the flight trajectory with the FDR readings. 
The estimated wind speed and direction are shown to match 
rather well with the FDR data. A crosswind of approximately 
26.6 knots was encountered at touchdown point. However, 
the value is much higher than the broadcast wind speed 
recorded by airport weather instrument.

WINDSHEAR HAZARDS INDEXS 
 
The F-Factor is often quoted in indicating the severity 
of windshear and is derived [9] as following: 
a
zx
V
W
g
WF +≈

,                             (1) 
∫=
+ Lx
x
Fds
L
F 1 ,                              (2) 
where xW  is the rate of change of the horizontal wind 
component along the aircraft flight path, g is the acceleration 
due to gravity, and Va the airspeed of the aircraft. The first 
term on the right hand side of Equation (1) represents the 
contribution due to the head wind change while the second 
term represents the contribution due to the vertical wind. 
FAA has adopted 1-km averaged F-factor index ( F ) to 
smooth the perturbations that may cause false alarm. It also 
represents a persisted deterioration of hazardous conditions. 
In addition, a threshold of F = 0.13 has been adopted. The 
index reflects the airplane’s longitudinal threatened level 
without the consideration of flight parameters in lateral 
direction. 
 
An aircraft in flight is subject to the wind and 
consequently the wind effect on aircraft ground velocity 
becomes significant. The speed relative to the ground is the 
resultant of the aircraft velocity (air speed) and the wind 
velocity, wak VVV
KKK
+= , where the subscripts a and k denote 
the velocities with respect to the surrounding atmosphere 
and the Earth, respectively.  
 
During the aircraft’s landing course, the tracking angle 
normally is important information for pilot to maintain 
alignment with the runway. Basically, the current flight 
tracking angle (χ) is computed from true heading (ψ) and 
drift angle (δ). Furthermore, according to the relations of 
airspeed and wind speed, the drift angle can be represented 
by the sideslip angle (βa) and the crosswind-induced angle 
(βw) (see Equation (3)). It should be addressed that the terms 
‘crab angle’ and ‘drift angle’ are very often used in lieu of 
'wind correction angle' but the latter term is more precise. 
Crab angle and drift angle do have slightly different 
meanings or associations. Drift angle is measured in flight, 
being the angle between the heading and the current track. 
Crab angle is the preferred term when associated with 
crosswind landing.

Figure 2: Relationships among Angles 
 
If it is desired to keep the direct route along the runway, 
it should be ascertained that pilot is capable of recovering 
the crosswind correction angle (
XCA
χ ), which is the angular 
difference between the current tracking angle (χ) and the 
required track angle (χr):
