英文摘要 
Keywords: block copolymers; self-assembling behavior; dissipative particle dynamics;

We employ dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to examine the self-assembling behavior of 
ABC copolymers which involve competing length scales. Hierarchical polymeric materials, with 
structure-within-structure morphologies, have attracted interest due to their potential as 
responsive materials. In this project, we systematically examine the effects of composition, 
degree of copolymerization, and the incompatibility between each pair of components, on the 
formation of microstructures with two different length scales in different architectures of 
copolymers including AB2 miktoarm star, ABC star, A-block-(B-graft-C), and A2-star-(B-alt-C).

前言、目的與文獻探討 
由於分子生物、物理、化學、材料科學等的蓬勃發展與應用，對於物質之分子或分子
集團其結構的了解日益重要。尤其是塊狀共聚合物系統，由於化學鍵在兩個塊狀之間形
成，因此來自於不同分子種類的不相容性，並不會促使巨觀相分離的產生，取而代之的是
奈米級微結構的形成(10-1000Å )，這些型態具有新穎的材料特性和高價值的科技應用。一
般來說，最簡單的 AB 塊狀共聚合物，其所形成的微結構通常只具有一個特徵尺寸大小，
若能將其改進使之產生有二種特徵尺寸等級可能性的微結構，將更有助於尖端科技產業的
發展。 
近十年來，隨著化學合成技術的進步，科學家已能合成出各種複雜的分子結構
(molecular architecture)以及二種單體以上的共聚合物，使得高分子共聚合物所形成的結構
型態與尺寸呈現了更加豐富與令人驚奇的面貌！舉例來說，這些共聚合物的發展，將原先
僅存在一種奈米尺寸等級的微結構，進而衍生出兩種不同尺寸等級同時存在的微結構，也
就是所謂的結構內有結構(structure-within-structure)。此二種等級尺寸同時存在的結構特殊
性，將材料的微小化更向前跨了一步，也意味著我們可以得到更嶄新的材料性質，進而更
有助於開發高分子在光電、生醫或其他功能性材料的潛力應用，為人類帶來更多的社會福
祉。 
關於高分子結構內有結構形成的相關文獻，目前發現到起碼有三十篇的論文是利用
「超分子化學」的概念，也就是在一般的 AB 嵌段共聚合物中，將第三成份的短鏈段或小
分子 C 接枝上其中的 B 塊狀，亦即 A-block-(B-graft-C)線性梳狀系統。研究顯示此系統可
以形成以下種類的結構內有結構：層狀內有球狀(spherical-within-lamellar)、層狀內有柱狀
(cylindrical-within-lamellar)、層狀內有層狀(lamellar -within-lamellar)、柱狀內有層狀
(lamellar-within-cylindrical)、球狀內有層狀(lamellar-within-spherical) (如圖一所示)。例如：
Ikalla 等研究群[1-10]合成一系列的 polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-block-P4VP)
共聚合物，再利用氫鍵將 pentadecylphenol(PDP)接枝於 P4VP 形成 PS-block-(P4VP-graft-
PDP)的線性梳狀共聚合物系統，他們藉由穿透式電子顯微鏡(transmission electron 
microscope, TEM)與小角 X 光散射(small angel X-ray scattering, SAXS)得到了上述的結構內
有結構形成。他們更近一步發現到溫度可以造成微結構的演變，當溫度低於 P4VP 與 PDP
的有序-無序轉換溫度 (order-disorder transition temperature，ODT)時，梳狀端內部會形成小
尺寸的層狀結構；隨著溫度逐漸提高到 P4VP 與 PDP 的 ODT 之上時，原先存在於(P4VP-
graft-PDP)塊狀內的小尺寸層狀轉變為無序排列，但大尺寸結構則不受影響；當溫度遠高
於 P4VP 與 PDP 的 ODT 時，由於 PDP 與 P4VP 間的氫鍵開始斷裂，使得 PDP 脫落並逐漸
往 PS 移動，換言之也代表逐漸增加 PS 的體積分率，導致大尺寸結構開始造成一系列有序
-有序的結構衍變。此外，清華大學的陳信龍教授[11]合成了 poly(1,4-butadiene)-block-
poly(ethylene oxide) (PB-block-PEO)共聚合物，再利用氫鍵將 dodecylbenzenesulfonic 
acid(DBSA)接枝於 PEO 形成 PB-block-(PEO- graft-DBSA)線性梳狀共聚合物系統，他們運
用 SAXS 觀察到當溫度高於梳狀端內 PEO 與 DBSA 的 ODT 時，由於 PB 的體積分率較
小，因此系統形成大尺寸的球狀結構，隨著溫度降到低於梳狀端內 PEO 與 DBSA 的 ODT
時，PEO 與 DBSA 開始形成小尺寸的層狀結構並引發大尺寸結構由球狀轉變為柱狀，也就
是形成 cylindrical-within-lamellar 的結構。

The parameter λ is introduced to account for some additional effects of the stochastic interactions. 
A detailed investigation of the effects of λ on the steady state temperature has been reported by 
Groot and Warren [29].
 
For the particle density ρ = 3 and the constant σ = 3, they found an 
optimum value of λ = 0.65, in which the temperature control can be significantly maintained even 
at a large time step of 0.06. Here, we choose λ = 0.65 and the time step Δt = 0.05 according to ref. 
[29]. 
The DPD simulations are performed in a cubic box of L
3
 grids with periodic boundary 
conditions. The particle density ρ is set equal to 3. Hence, the total simulated DPD beads are 3L3. 
On the basis of the algorithm described above, the time evolutions of motion for these particles 
are started with an initially disordered configuration and simulated within the cubic box. Each 
simulation is performed until the formed structure remains somewhat unchanged with the time 
step. In general, the resulting morphology patterns via DPD are dependent of the finite size of the 
simulation box, as have been reported in other theoretical studies [32-34]. In order to exclude the 
finite size effects, one has to keep enlarging the simulation box size until the structures are no 
longer affected by the simulation box. 
The dimensionless interaction parameter (i.e., in terms of kBT) between like particles a

when the particle density ρ = 3 is set equal to 25 according to the work of Groot and Warren [29]. 
The interaction parameter between different components I and J can be estimated by the 
following relationship between a
IJ
 and the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter 
IJ  derived by 
Groot and Warren [29] for ρ = 3,

Therefore, the value of a
ij
 25  corresponds to 0ij  , which indicates that components i and j 
are very miscible. As the incompatibility between i and j increases, a
ij
 increases from 25.

Figure 5.  Morphology variation of A2B miktoarm star copolymers with fB at aAB = 34. The 
red and green colors represent A and B, respectively. The red and green surfaces correspond to 
the isosurfaces of component A and B, respectively. 
 
Recall that when fB is larger, such as fB = 0.75 ~ 0.8, the SCMF theory predicted a wide 
region of HEX
AC , i.e., the minority A-branch arms form the hexagonally packed cylinders. In our 
DPD simulations, we find that when the interaction parameter aAB is larger, although the A2B 
copolymers can form a stable HEX
AC  phase (a typical example when fB = 0.8 and aAB = 34 is shown 
in Fig. 5) eventually, these A-formed cylinders still connect with each other after running a long 
simulation time. As the interaction parameter aAB decreases, for example when aAB = 33 and fB is 
still fixed at 0.8, the resulting morphology pattern shown in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrates that these 
miktoarm star copolymers can no longer form HEX
AC  but instead a tube-like phase. A reasonable 
explanation may be given as follows. When the component with more arms per molecule (i.e., A) 
is a minority so that these A arms remain on the concave side of the interface, because curving 
the interface inward toward the A domains causes more lateral crowding of these A multi-arms 
and thereafter excess stretching in A, the formed microstructures become loose and less ordered. 
That is, the well ordered A-formed cylindrical and/or spherical phases are difficult to form and 
only a tube-like phase is observed. In fact, Pochan et al. [35] reported similar results in PS-PI2 
miktoarm star copolymers that when the composition of PS, fPS, is 0.81, the system is not ordered 
into a specific lattice but is microphase separated into worm-like micelles, as observed in DPD. 
In order to quantitatively compare the phase diagram determined from both DPD and SCMF 
theory, we first use Eq. (10) to transform the interaction parameter in the DPD simulations, aAB, 
into the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter in the SCMF theory, AB. As the copolymer chains 
in our simulations are very short (N=20), due to the significant fluctuation effects which stabilize 
the disordered state, the expected values of AB N  at the ODT are larger than those for infinite

ABC Miktoarm Star Copolymers (This part has been published in Phys. Rev. E 77 (2008) 
031804.) 
In this study we choose the total number of beads for an ABC three-arm molecule to be 
fixed at N = NA+NB+NC =20. These three arms are assumed to connect at one core bead (denoted 
as Y). In order to exclude the effects associated with the existence of the core bead, we set the 
Flory-Huggins interaction parameter between the core and each component of A, B, and C, equal 
to 0. Here, we aim to explore how the resulting morphology formation at various composition 
ratios of fA/fB/fC is influenced by varying the interaction parameters (aAB, aAC, and aBC). For a 
comparison with the current theoretical studies via MC and SCMF approaches, we also set 
symmetric interaction parameters, i.e., aAB = aAC = aBC = a, at the current stage. We will show 
that even in this simplified case, the ABC star copolymers, in particular when the composition of 
one of the three components is significantly large, display a series of quite interesting 
morphology transition from one-length-scale microstructure into two-length-scale hierarchical 
structure-within-structure with the interaction parameter. In general, the morphological transition 
behavior we display here, as a first systematic study by varying the interaction parameter and 
composition, may provide insights for exploring novel structures associated with the ABC 
copolymers. 
In order to highlight the effects of composition on the resulting morphological behavior, we 
choose the symmetric interaction parameter a = 36 and construct the corresponding phase triangle 
in terms of three compositions fA, fB, and fC, in Fig. 7. In view of the phase diagram, most of the 
interesting simulated microstructures formed by the ABC star copolymers can be displayed along

form alternately arranged cylinders in the AB-rich layers and penetrate into the holes of C layers 
(denoted as CA+CB within PLC). In addition to these types of polygonal cylinders, we observe 
another kind of cylindrical phase via DPD, [10.6.4;10.8.4] (i.e., [3.3.4.3.4]), which typically 
forms at fA/fB/fC =0.3/0.2/0.5 or 0.2/0.3/0.5. It should be noted that when the three interaction 
parameters are equal, we observe this phase easily when fA fB and fC is around 0.5 instead of the 
most frequently observed structure of [12.6.4] via MC, though [3.3.4.3.4] has also been simulated 
via MC with the chain length ratio of 9:7:14 and 9:7:16. However, when the three interaction 
parameters are not symmetric anymore, it is easy to observe the formation of [12.6.4] via DPD. 
For example, when we vary the three interaction parameters from equal case to 
BC AB ACa a a  , 
i.e., the interaction between B and C is significantly larger than that between A and B (C), the 
ABC star copolymer with fA/fB/fC =0.25/0.25/0.5 can transform easily from [10.6.6;10.6.4] into 
[12.6.4]. It is not surprising because of the fact that both B and C blocks tend to avoid contacts 
each other and thus stretch more into their respective domains. This behavior is analogous to 
increasing the volume fractions of B and C. Accordingly, the vertex number of polygons formed 
by the majority C and minority B increases from 10 to 12, and coexistence of 6 and 4 to 6, 
respectively; whereas the minority A-formed polygons transform from coexistence of hexagons 
and tetragons to only tetragons. 
Now we continue to discuss the systems with fC increasing to 0.6, in which both 
compositions fA and fB are comparatively smaller than fC and hence the three-phase separated 
polygonal cylinders are no longer formed. For example, when fA = fB = 0.2 and fC = 0.6, the 
morphology pattern in Fig. 8 shows a C-rich and AB-rich lamellar phase with A- and B- formed 
cylinders alternately packed in the AB-rich layers (CA+CB within L). As fC increases further to 0.7, 
though a lamellar phase is still formed, both amounts of A and B are not enough to form well-
ordered cylinders. Therefore we observe the formation of A- and B- segregated domains within 
the AB-rich lamellae when fC = 0.7. Furthermore, when fC becomes even larger, these two 
minority components A and B can no longer separate each other at lower values of interaction 
parameters. Accordingly, we observe a tube-like and a disordered phase at fC = 0.8 and 0.9, 
respectively. 
To illustrate the effects of interaction parameter a on the structure formation, we 
systematically vary the symmetric interaction parameter a and examine the morphology patterns 
for a series of the systems along the symmetric composition line of fA = fB = (1-fC)/2. Based on the 
fact that how the morphological behavior is affected by the interaction parameter, the ABC star 
copolymers can be divided into two main regimes. First, for the systems with fC 0.5, provided 
that the interaction parameter a is large enough to exceed the order-disorder transition (ODT) 
value, the formed morphology is almost not influenced by the interaction parameter and mainly 
dominated by the composition. A series of transition from LA,B with C in the interfaces (fC = 
0.1) [8.8.4] (fC = 0.2) [6.6.6] (fC = 0.3-0.4) [10.6.6;10.6.4] (fC = 0.5) is observed, which 
has been clearly manifested previously and will not be reiterated here. Our DPD results in this 
composition regime confirm to the fact that the simulated morphology patterns in strong and 
weak segregation regimes via MC and SCMF methods, respectively, are identical. 
When fC 0.6 so that two of the components A and B are significantly minor, we find that a 
series of morphology transition can be induced by varying the interaction parameter a. As 
expected, with increasing the interaction parameter a, the two minority components A and B first 
act like one component, and the system separates into AB-rich and C-rich phases; then a further 
segregation between the two minority A and B occurs within the AB-rich phases and the system 
forms the so-called hierarchical structure-within-structures. For example, when fC = 0.6, the 
disordered system first transforms into AB-formed tubes and then undergoes a series of four 
types of well-ordered morphology transition of A- and B- segregated domains within LCA+CB

Figure 10.  Morphology variation of ABC star copolymers with the interaction parameter a 
for the systems symmetric compositions of A and B (fA = fB) when fC = (a) 0.7, (b) 0.8, and (c) 0.9, 
respectively. The red and green colors represent A and B, respectively. The red, green, and blue 
surfaces correspond to the isosurfaces of component A, B, and C, respectively. For clarity, we 
omitted the C blocks in the patterns. 
 
The fact that increasing the interaction parameter a enables the A and B minority to form 
alternately packed spherical or disk-like domains instead of cylindrical domains can be seen more 
obviously when fC increases to 0.7 in Fig. 10(a). When the interaction parameter a < 50, two 
types of morphologies, A- and B- segregated domains within L (a = 36) and CA+CB within L (40 
< a < 50) are formed, as in the system of fC = 0.6. As a continues to increase further, we observe 
the formation of segmented A- and B- wormlike micelles (SWMA,B) within a 3D network. To 
clarify, the A and B minority components respectively form oblate spherical micelles, which 
alternately pack to form a 3D wormlike network. Indeed, the alternately segmented A- and B- 
micelles can be formed in a wide range of fC 0.7. Fig. 10(b) and 10(c) illustrate the characteristic 
morphology patterns as a function of the interaction parameter a formed by the systems with fC = 
0.8 and 0.9, respectively. When fC = 0.8, we first observe the formation of A- and B- segregated 
domains within PLAB in the range of 40 < a < 50, and then these minority A and B can form 
alternately-arranged wormlike micelles within PLAB or 3D network as the interaction parameter a 
keeps increasing. As fC increases to 0.9, since the compositions of A and B are very minor, the 
formed ordered structures are no longer lamellae or perforated layers. Instead, we observe 
hexagonally packed AB-formed cylinders( HEX
ABC ), within which the two minority components A 
and B are first miscible together and then segregate to form alternately piled disk-like micelles, as 
the interaction parameter a increases.

HEX
BCC  (-
10aBC0) → BCG (15aBC25) → A,BCL  (30aBC90) → B,CL -within- A,BCL  
(100aBC120), is observed in Fig. 12. That is, as aBC increases from 25, though the segregation 
degree between B and C becomes more obvious, the systems still retain at a stable A-rich and 
BC-rich lamellar phase in a wide range of aBC between 30 and 90, and no further diblock-like 
large-length-scale transition as mentioned above occurs. Indeed, these results are not surprising 
since when aBC keeps increasing such that in order to reduce the contacts between B and C, the 
BC-alternating chain would rather fold within the original BC-rich layers to form small-length-
scale B-rich and C-rich lamellae, i.e., the so-called hierarchical LB,C-within-LA,BC. Moreover, the 
resulting hierarchical periodicity is formed in parallel direction to each other, which is different 
from that in comb-coil copolymers. When the value of aAB = aAC is fixed to a lower value such as 
40, similar morphology transition associated with the large-length-scale ordering has also been 
observed by varying the interaction parameter aBC. Whereas, even when aBC increases to a very 
large value of 120, we do not find the formation of the hierarchical structure-within-structure 
morphology induced by aBC, as in the case of aAB = aAC at larger values. This manifests the fact 
that in order to form the small-length-scale lamellar segregation between B and C within the 
large-scale BC-rich domains, not only the interaction parameters between B and C (aBC) but also 
between the A-coil block and the BC-alternating block (aAB and aAC) have to be significantly 
large. If the value of aAB = aAC continues to decrease, since the repulsion between A and B(C) 
  17 
majority BC component still tends to form the minor domains in the minority A-rich matrix, i.e., 
the so-called inverted microstructures. This is due to the fact that when B and C become more 
attractive, the BC-alternating blocks favor to coil together in order to reduce the contacts with the 
A-blocks. Note that these inverted structures have been frequently observed in block copolymer 
solutions by increasing the solvent selectivity and/or the solvent amount. However, this is 
possibly the first study to predict their presence in the A2-star-(B-alt-C) copolymer melts. 
Now, let us continue to discuss the phase behavior shown in Fig. 13 for each copolymer with a 
particular value of fA when aBC increases from 25. Similar to the copolymer with fA = 0.54, a 
significant increase in the interaction parameter aBC also leads to the formation of small-length-
scale B and C segregated lamellae within the large-length-scale BC-rich domains for the 
copolymers with other values of fA in a wide range of 0.2-0.85. In Fig. 14 we display the various 
types of structure-within-structures, such as A-formed spheres in the matrix formed by B and C 
alternating layers (
AS -within- B,CL ) (fA 0.14), hexagonally packed A-formed cylinders in the 
matrix with B and C segregated layers ( HEX
AC -within- B,CL ) (fA 0.23), B,CL -within- A,BCL  
(0.3 fA0.6), coaxial B and C alternating domains within hexagonally packed BC-formed 
cylinders in the A-matrix (
B,CL -within-
HEX
BCC ) (0.65 fA0.7), and cocentric BC-alternating 
domains within BC-formed spheres in the A-matrix (
B,CL -within- BCS ) (0.75 fA0.85), which 
are simulated at aBC = 120. Note that the two-length-scale morphology of AS -within- B,CL  shown 
in Fig. 14 is obtained for the case of N increased to 21. This is simply because of the fact that in 
the original case of N=13, the lowest value of fA that the system can reach is 0.23. Accordingly, in 
order to observe whether the 
AS -within- B,CL  structure is possible to form at smaller values of fA, 
we increase N to 21. Generally speaking, the geometry of large-length-scale morphology is 
mainly dominated by the composition fA. If we further examine the small-length-scale formation 
of B and C alternating layers within the major domains, such as HEX
AC -within- B,CL  and B,CL -
within-
A,BCL , it is clear that these layers are parallel to the A-formed cylinders or lamellae. More 
interestingly, when fA is larger than 0.5 so that B and C segregation occurs within the minor 
domains such as HEX
BCC  and BCS , these BC-alternating chains fold in a particular way to form 
multiple (more than 2) B and C coaxial cylinders or cocentric spheres. Note that when fA is 0.85 
and N = 13, since each molecule only contains one B and one C, we only observe C-core/B-shell 
spheres as in Fig. 14. These multiple coaxial cylinders or cocentric spheres formed by the BC-
alternating blocks in the A2-star-(B-alt-C) copolymers are possibly reported for the first time. 
Though it has been shown that the ABC linear triblock copolymers can form core-shell types of 
cylinders or spheres, the number of segregated layers within the domains is generally two instead 
of the multiple (more than two) layers that the A2-star-(B-alt-C) can form. 
In Fig. 14 we also plot the schematic molecular alignment in detail for each structure-within-
structure. Compared with the A-block-(B-graft-C) coil-comb copolymers as presented in Fig. 15, 
we observe a completely different packing behavior of molecules due to the difference of 
molecular architecture. Hence, the hierarchical structure-within-structures that these two 
copolymers can form are significantly different. In particular, the small-length-scale lamellae 
formed by the B-alt-C and B-graft-C chains display a parallel and perpendicular direction, 
respectively, with respect to the large-length-scale structure. We believe this characteristic 
difference could impose different influences upon various properties of polymers, such as 
photoelectronic properties, and lead to different potential applications.

volume fractions of AB and C studied here. As aAB increases, due to the fact that the immiscibility 
degree between A and B becomes more significant, the B component would gradually depart 
from the original AB-rich domains into the interfaces between A-rich and C-rich domains, and 
further stay in the C-rich domains. This behavior is analogous to decreasing the effective 
composition in the AB-rich domains, and thus a transition from 
AB,CL → AG →
HEX
AC → AS  occurs 
with an increase in aAB. Furthermore, it is interesting to observe that when aAB keeps increasing so 
that most of the B chains are pushed towards the C-rich domains, whereas, the fact that there also 
exists significant degree of incompatibility between B and C (aAC = aBC = 70) enables a small-
length-scale B and C segregated lamellar phase formed within the large-length-scale BC-rich 
matrix. 
Not only varying the interaction parameter aAB but also aAC = aBC can induce a series of 
morphology transitions associated with two length scales. To illustrate this, we first perform the 
DPD simulations by varying aAC = aBC for fA = 0.2, N = 10, and aAB fixed at a larger repulsion 
value of 100. As can be seen clearly in Fig. 18(a), a series of transition from 
AS  → AS -within- 
B,CL → AC -within- B,CL  occurs with an increase in aAC = aBC from 50 to 70 to 80, respectively. It 
is not surprising that the small-length-scale B and C lamellae are formed with increasing the 
interaction parameter between B and C. Moreover, increasing the value of aAC and aBC 
simultaneously may also enhance the segregation of B from C towards A, and thus causes a 
large-length-scale morphology transition towards increasing the effective composition of A from 
AS  to 
HEX
AC . Similar trend of morphology transition at large-length-scale with increasing aAC = 
aBC has also been observed for the same system but aAB at a smaller value of 50, which is 
displayed in Fig. 18(b). Clearly, a transition from 
AS  → 
HEX
AC → AG  occurs as aAC = aBC 
increases from 50 to 70 to 100, respectively. However, in this case we observe no existence of the 
structure-within-structure even increasing aAC = aBC up to a high value of 100. These results

align to form A-rich and C-rich segregated domains with B in the interfaces. Indeed, this is 
reasonable due to the fact that when the length of the BC-comb block becomes short, the 
segregation degree between B and C is not significant enough to make these B and C well aligned 
to form lamellae. Hence, the resulting morphology is mainly driven by the segregation between A 
and C, and B acts more like a component in the interfaces. By increasing the length of the BC-
comb block, one may expect that B and C will separate evidently and form a lamellar structure. 
For example, when N increases to 20, both types of hierachical structures of the A-formed 
cylinders in the matrix with B and C segregated layers ( HEX
AC -within- B,CL ) (fA = 0.3, 0.4) and 
segregated B and C lamellae within the A-rich and BC-rich lamellae (
B,CL -within- A,BCL ) (fA = 
0.5), are observed. When fA increases to 0.6, though the small-length-scale B and C lamellae are 
not well formed within the BC-rich lamellae for N = 20, the formation of 
B,C A,BCL -within-L  is 
still clearly observed as N increases to 25. These simulated structure-within-structures, in which 
the small-length-scale lamellae are typically perpendicular to the large-length-scale structures, are 
in good agreement with those observed experimentally in A-block-(B-graft-C) coil-comb 
copolymers. Note that we have not obtained other types of structure-within-structures, such as 
B,CL -within-CBC and B,CL -within-SBC. This is mainly due to the fact that these hierarchical 
structures are formed when fA is larger (i.e., the comb composition is smaller). Accordingly, the 
total chain length N has to increase further in order to generate the small-length-scale lamellar 
ordering of B and C.

Structure and Dynamics of Water Surrounding the 
Poly(methacrylic acid):A Molecular Dynamics Study

Abstract.  All-atom molecular dynamics simulations are used to study a single chain of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) 
in aqueous solutions at various degrees of charge density. We observe that local arrangements of water molecules, surrounding 
the functional groups of COO- and COOH in the chain, behave differently and correlated well to the resulting chain 
conformation behavior. Furthermore, water molecules often act as a bridging agent between two neighboring COO- groups. 
These bridged water molecules are observed to stabilize the rod-like chain conformation that the highly charged chain reveals, as 
they significantly limit torsional and bending degrees of the backbone monomers. In addition, they display different dynamic 
properties from the bulk water. Both the resulting oxygen and hydrogen spectra are greatly shifted due to the presence of strong 
H-bonded interactions.

INTRODUCTION 
Polyelectrolytes are of great importance due to 
their extensive presence throughout biological systems 
and use in a wide range of practical applications, such 
as sensors, detergents, drug delivery, and gene therapy.
 
In general, polyelectrolytes, when in a solution, 
dissociate into polyions and counterions. The 
associated electrostatic interactions that involve the 
polyions, counterions, and the solvent, make the chain 
conformation behavior of polyelectrolytes quite 
distinct from that of neutral polymers. Polyelectrolyte 
conformation has been, and continues to be, an 
important research area, not only for its relevance to 
physical properties but also for a deeper understanding 
of biological phenomena and applications. 
Experiments have shown that polyelectrolyte 
conformation in dilute solutions depends on the charge 
density that exists along the chain, salt concentration, 
ionic strength, and the solution pH value [1-3]. For 
example, highly charged polyelectrolyte chains in low 
ionic strength monovalent salt solutions exhibit an 
extended conformation due to the net repulsion 
between the charged monomers. When the added salts 
are multivalent, a series of transitions from extended 
→ collapsed → re-expanded conformations often 
occurs upon increasing the salt concentrations. Though 
current theoretical studies have captured most of the 
phenomena associated with the conformational 
variation in polyelectrolytes [2,4-7], solvent effects 
that involve direct electrostatic interactions between 
solvent and polyelectrolyte, the local arrangement of 
the solvent molecules around the polyelectrolyte chain, 
and the formation of the hydrogen bonds between the 
solvent molecules and monomers, have not yet been 
addressed. 
We thus employ all-atom molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations to study the local structure and 
dynamics of water in the vicinity of a single 
polyelectrolyte chain. We consider a single molecule 
of syndiotactic poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) in an 
aqueous solution. We show that due to the strong 
attractive interactions between water and charged 
monomers, the water molecules form highly bonded 
structures surrounding the chain via the formation of 
hydrogen bonds. These bridged water molecules 
significantly affect the resulting chain conformation 
behavior as well as their dynamic properties. 
MODEL AND SIMULATION METHODS 
We employ an Energy Calculations and 
Dynamics (ENCAD) simulation program [8], which is 
an all-atom model, to calculate the atomic interaction 
parameters between the PMAA and the solvent water. 
  31 
(-C=O) in the COOH group, and the O atom of 
hydroxyl (-OH) in the COOH group of the PMAA at 
various values of charge density f, in Figs. 2 and 3, 
respectively, This radial distribution function gA-B(r) 
indicates the local probability density of finding B 
atoms at a distance r from A atoms averaged over the 
equilibrium density. In Fig. 2, where the distribution of 
water (H and O atoms) is analyzed from the central O 
atom in the COO
-
 group, we observe two prominent 
peaks for the hydrogen RDF profiles and one for the 
oxygen RDF profiles regardless of the charge density f 
values. The observed high and sharp first peaks as well 
as the first minimum values close to 0 for both   
gO(COO
-
)-H and gO(COO
-
)-O  manifest the fact that these 
COO
-
 groups are strongly hydrophilic in nature and 
therefore attract a large amount of water molecules to 
form shell-like layers surrounding them. In addition, 
the first peak of the hydrogen RDF profiles occurs at 
1.4 Å , which is less than the normal hydrogen bonding 
length of 1.8 Å  [13], indicating that the interaction 
between the O atom of the COO
-
 group and the H 
atom of the water molecule is stronger than the 
strength of hydrogen bonds in bulk water. This is 
expected as polar water molecules and negatively 
charged oxygen atoms have a stronger interaction than 
in bulk water.

and hydrogen (H) atoms of water with respect to the O atom 
in the COO- groups at various values of charge density f. 
 
Next, we discuss the distribution of water 
surrounding the COOH group, as shown in Fig. 3. we 
find the height of the first peaks in Fig. 3 is less than 1, 
i.e., the local water density surrounding the COOH 
groups is even smaller than that of bulk water. To 
clarify, only a small amount of hydrogen bonds form 
between the water molecules and the COOH groups. 
Indeed, for the noncharged PMAA case (f = 0), we 
observe that when the distance from the COOH group 
is smaller than Rg (≒10Å ), all the water distribution 
profiles are far less than 1.0. This indicates that the 
COOH groups appear to be less hydrophilic in nature 
and therefore fewer water molecules could remain 
inside the coiled PMAA chain.

atoms of water with respect to the O atom of -C=O and -OH 
in the COOH groups at various values of charge density f. 
 
Fig. 4(a) presents the vibration spectra of the 
water oxygen types, O0, O1, and O2, which are 
obtained by applying the Fourier transformation to the 
VACF profiles. O0, O1, and O2 belong to the water  
molecules in the bulk state, with a single hydrogen 
bond formed with the COO
-
 group, and with two 
hydrogen bonds formed with the COO
-
 groups, 
respectively. The O0 spectrum shows a major peak 
centered around 58cm
-1
 and a broad shoulder peak at 
around 200-300cm
-1
, which has been observed in other 
MD studies [14,15]. When water molecules have 
stronger interactions with charged COO
-
 groups, 
through the formation of the hydrogen bonds (O2 > O1 
> O0), we observe that both spectrum peaks shift to 
higher wavenumbers. Worthy of note, is that the 
second peak of the O2 spectrum (i.e., the bridged 
water molecules between two neighboring COO
-
 
groups) moves significantly toward 400cm
-1
. 
Moreover, the second peak becomes more significant 
while the first peak shows an opposite trend. Similar to 
the low frequency Raman spectra of liquid water 
reported by Walrafen et al.[16], these results imply 
that the second peak is primarily associated with the 
H-bonded O-O intermolecular stretching vibration, 
whereas the first peak is attributed to the non-H-
bonded molecules. In Fig. 4(b) we present the 
hydrogen spectrum, which is typically related to the 
libration (400-1200cm
-1
), intramolecular bending 
(1200-2200cm
-1
) and intramolecular stretching (2200-
4000cm
-1
) motions. It is apparent that the presence of 
the charged COO
-
 groups has a significant influence 
on the resulting hydrogen spectrum. The hydrogen 
atoms are divided into four types of H0, H1y, H1n, 
and H2. Note, for the water molecules with only one 
hydrogen bond formed with the COO
-
 group, the two 
types of hydrogen-bonded and non hydrogen-bonded 
H atoms are denoted as H1y and H1n, respectively. 
We find that for the H1y and H2 atoms, which are 
strongly connected to the oxygen atoms of the COO
-
 
groups, both the libration and bending peaks shift 
significantly from a lower frequency for H0 towards a

Figure 3.  The radial distribution functions of  hydrogen (H) 
atoms of water with respect to the O atom of -C=O and -OH 
in the COOH groups at various values of charge density f. 
 
Fig. 4(a) presents the vibration spectra of the 
water oxygen types, O0, O1, and O2, which are 
obtained by applying the Fourier transformation to the 
VACF profiles. O0, O1, and O2 belong to the water  
molecules in the bulk state, with a single hydrogen 
bond formed with the COO- group, and with two 
hydrogen bonds formed with the COO- groups, 
respectively. The O0 spectrum shows a major peak 
centered around 58cm-1 and a broad shoulder peak at 
around 200-300cm-1, which has been observed in other 
MD studies [14,15]. When water molecules have 
stronger interactions with charged COO- groups, 
through the formation of the hydrogen bonds (O2 > O1 
> O0), we observe that both spectrum peaks shift to 
higher wavenumbers. Worthy of note, is that the 
second peak of the O2 spectrum (i.e., the bridged 
water molecules between two neighboring COO- 
groups) moves significantly toward 400cm-1. 
Moreover, the second peak becomes more significant 
while the first peak shows an opposite trend. Similar to 
the low frequency Raman spectra of liquid water 
reported by Walrafen et al.[16], these results imply 
that the second peak is primarily associated with the 
H-bonded O-O intermolecular stretching vibration, 
whereas the first peak is attributed to the non-H-
bonded molecules. In Fig. 4(b) we present the 
hydrogen spectrum, which is typically related to the 
libration (400-1200cm-1), intramolecular bending 
(1200-2200cm-1) and intramolecular stretching (2200-
4000cm-1) motions. It is apparent that the presence of 
the charged COO- groups has a significant influence 
on the resulting hydrogen spectrum. The hydrogen 
atoms are divided into four types of H0, H1y, H1n, 
and H2. Note, for the water molecules with only one 
hydrogen bond formed with the COO- group, the two 
types of hydrogen-bonded and non hydrogen-bonded 
H atoms are denoted as H1y and H1n, respectively. 
We find that for the H1y and H2 atoms, which are 
strongly connected to the oxygen atoms of the COO- 
groups, both the libration and bending peaks shift 
significantly from a lower frequency for H0 towards a
