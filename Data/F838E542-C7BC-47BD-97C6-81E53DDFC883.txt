Abstract 
The system analysis of a ASK receiver was 
performed. With a given noise bandwidth of 10 
MHz and a required SNR of 10 dB, the receiver 
can achieve a sensitivity of -87.2 dBm. In 
addition, the simulation / measurement of 
S-parameters for integrated antennas in CMOS 
processes were performed. The gain and pattern 
for these chip-antennas were also investigated. 
Due to silicon-substrate conductivity, the 
chip-antennas exhibited gain of -7.5 dB to -8.5 
dB. It was also found that the grounded metal 
plate under the device-under-test during the 
measurement would have large impact on the 
directivity and gain of the antenna, which 
should be prevented. 
 
Key Words:  Antenna, CMOS, Receiver 
 
二、研究目的 
由於本計畫要建造一個操作於 60-GHz 的無
線單晶收發系統，必須先對整個系統做一完
整的分析。在本年度我們先針對收發機的靈
敏度去考慮，並依此訂出各個子電路的規
格。此外 CMOS 的晶片式天線技術尚未成
熟，我們也必須要先對此種天線的特性做一
深入的探討，並依此得出最佳的解決方案。 
 
三、研究內容 
ASK receiver system analysis 
The architecture of our 60-GHz receiver is 
shown in Fig.1. The ASK modulation was 
chosen to implement the system for its 
advantages of simplicity and power-saving. The 
receiver consists of a LNA, a sub-harmonic 
mixer and a demodulator. All the circuit 
performances are provided by the designers of 
these circuits, based on their simulation.  
 
 
Fig. 1 The ASK receiver block diagram 
 
A system analysis has been performed with the 
receiver chain as shown in Fig.2. The cascade 
noise figure is 6.8 dB. For ASK modulation, to 
achieve bit-error-rate of 10-3, the required SNR 
is 10 dB. With a given noise bandwidth of 10 
MHz and a required SNR of 10 dB, the receiver 
can achieve a sensitivity of -87.2 dBm. 
However, poor linearity or the lack of channel 
filter would degrade the sensitivity.

The S11 measurement results of meander 
antenna with length of 694 um before and after 
inductively-couple-plasma (ICP) post process 
were both shown in Fig. 6. S11 was measured 
with the chip put on the metal plate which is 
connected to ground.

Fig. 6 The measured S11 of the meander 
antenna with a total length of 694 um 
 
Due to the frequency limit of the measurement, 
the radiation pattern of the meander antenna 
with a total length of 694 um would be 
measured first. The following simulation was 
done for this antenna and would be compared 
with the measurement in the future. The layout 
used in the simulation is shown in the Fig. 7. 
 
 
Fig. 7 Layout view in the ADS momentum 
simulation 
 
First, a simulation was performed with the chip 
put on the metal plate as in the measurement. It 
can be found in Fig.8 that the simulation result 
agreed with the measurement in terms of S11. 
However, the gain was pretty poor.

The antenna parameters obtained are as follows; 
D~ 5dB, Gain ~ -20dB @ 40GHz. The antenna 
chip will be mounted on a printed board for the 
pattern measurement and a corresponding 
simulation was performed. As shown in Fig. 9, 
the optimal frequency of S11 was shifted to 36 
GHz. In addition, the gain was improved from 
-20 dB to -11.3 dB.

Meander antenna with length of 403 um by

S11 was measured with the chip put on a metal 
plate which is part of the probe station and 
connected to ground. In fact, the chip can be 
put on glass or other dielectric materials. Again, 
a simulation was performed with the chip put 
on the metal plate as in the measurement. It was 
found that the simulation result agreed with the 
measurement in terms of S11. And then a 
similar simulation was performed with the chip 
in free space. It was found the gain was 
improved from -20.3 dB to -8.5 dB by 
removing the metal layer under the chip.

And then, another simulation was performed to 
see the effect of the silicon substrate thinning 
by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) post 
process. It was found the gain could be 
improved while the antenna became less 
directive and probably more suitable for in-door 
applications.

If the sensor nodes are at a distance of 1 meter, 
the received power can be estimated as follows: 
Pr = Pt (dBm) + TX-Antenna-Gain (dB) + 
RX-Antenna-Gain (dB) – Path Loss 
Assuming that the transmitted power Pt is 
around 0 dBm and the path loss at 60 GHz in 
free space is 68 dB for 1 meter. A received 
power of at least -84 dBm can be obtained, 
which leaves 3 dB margins for our system. To 
achieve larger coverage, either the transmitted 
power or the number of sensor nodes should be 
increased for the given receiver sensitivity. 
 
Chip in free space, silicon substrate 
thickness=320um, D=5.8 dB, Gain=-13.5 dB 
 
Using the process parameters of TSMC 0.13um 
CMOS, a meander antenna was simulated. To 
achieve input matching at 60-GHz, the total 
length should be reduced.
