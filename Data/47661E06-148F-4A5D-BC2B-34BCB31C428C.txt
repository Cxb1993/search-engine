Abstract 
Hollow Ag/Pd nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by a galvanic displacement 
reaction, in which a small amount of Pd(NO3)2 is allowed to react with previously synthesized Ag 
nanoparticles that act as templates. The resulting hollow Ag/Pd (Ag/Pdhollow) nanoparticles are 
found to be icosahedral and decahedral in structure. The kinetics of electroless copper deposition 
(ECD) catalyzed by these bimetallic (Ag/Pdhollow) nanoparticles are analyzed using an 
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The results reveal that these Ag/Pdhollow 
nanoparticles have better catalytic activities than monometallic Ag and Pd nanoparticles. 
Furthermore, the catalytic activities of these hollow nanoparticles in the ECD bath can be 
controlled by tuning their alloy ratios in a suitable manner.

1. Introduction 
Nanoparticles fabricated from Ag-based alloys find extensive applications in catalysis [1], 
electrocatalysis [2], and optics because their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands appear in 
the visible region [1–4]. One reason to determine these properties is the structure of 
nanoparticles. Hollow nanoparticles fabricated from Ag-based alloys have attracted attention 
due to their catalytic [5, 6] and electrocatalytic activities [2, 7], and the SPR characteristics of 
hollow nanoparticles [2, 6, 8, 9] differ significantly from those of solid nanoparticles. Hollow 
Ag/Pd nanoshells have been found to show unique catalytic activities when used as catalysts for 
electroless copper deposition (ECD) [5, 10]. ECD has gained considerable significance in the 
field of nanocircuits [11]. The mechanism underlying ECD involves activation, which is a 
catalytic reaction triggered by active colloids on the surface of substrates dipped into the 
electroless bath [12]. The active catalyst acts as an electron carrier for the transfer of electrons 
from the reducing agent to the copper ions. Hence, the structure and composition of the catalyst 
can alter the deposition rate and reaction kinetics [13]. In a previous study, the authors prepared 
spherical Pd nanoparticles and used them as activators for ECD [12–14]. Additionally, for use 
in the electroless reaction, they synthesized solid nanocatalysts with Pd-rich shells from a 
Ag/Pd alloy by adding Ag particles to the microstructures of Pd nanoparticles. The 
nanocatalysts thus prepared showed enhanced catalytic activity [1]. In the present study, we 
synthesized hollow Ag/Pd (Ag/Pdhollow) nanoparticles via a displacement reaction. In this 
reaction, a small amount of Pd(NO3)2 was allowed to galvanically react with the Ag 
nanoparticles. The slight deposition of Pd ions on the surface of the Ag nanoparticles resulted in 
a closure of pores and the formation of hollow nanoparticles. Then, we used the synthesized 
Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles as ECD activators. We carried out electrochemical quartz crystal 
microbalance (EQCM) measurements to compare the kinetics of ECD catalyzed by Ag/Pdhollow 
nanoparticles with different alloy ratios (the Pd content remained constant) and those catalyzed 
by solid Pd nanoparticles.   
2. Experimental 
Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles of different compositions were prepared in the following manner. 
Anodic reaction:  −+ +→ eAgAg
E0 =- 0.7996 V 
Cathodic reaction:  PdePd →+ −+ 22
E0 = 0.951 V

Hence, the potential corresponding to the net reaction is 0.1514 V. The equlibrium constant (K) 
calculated using the formula Ereaction = (RT/nF) lnK is 1.09 × 105. Here, R = 8.314 J K–1 mol–1, T = 
303 K, n = 2, and F is Faraday’s constant. From the value of K and the TEM results, it can be 
concluded that the displacement reaction readily results in Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles, even when a 
low concentration of Pd(NO3)2 is used. Figure 1B shows TEM images of the microstructures of the 
hollow Ag45Pd1 nanoparticles obtained using 2.5 × 10–5 moles of AgNO3. It is evident that these 
Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles contain pores at the central location. HR-TEM observations reveal that 
hollow icosahedral (Fig. 2A) and decahedral (Fig. 2B) nanoparticles with porous {111} faces are 
formed from the displacement reaction. Ag nanoparticles synthesized by the displacement reaction 
using HAuCl4 as the displacing salt are found to have similar morphologies [9]. 
The optical properties of the prepared hollow nanoparticles were determined from their 
corresponding SPR spectra. Figure 3 compares the SPR extinction spectra of the cage-like 
bimetallic nanoparticles, their corresponding Ag nanotemplates, and Pd nanoparticles. A sharp 
peak at 405 nm was detected in the spectrum of the Ag nanotemplates. However, the SPR peak 
of the Pd nanoparticles could be detected only in the UV region. Comparison of the spectra of 
the Ag90Pd1 and Ag nanoparticles revealed a redshift of the bimetallic SPR peak to 479 nm. 
Broadening of this peak was observed after Pd was deposited on the Ag templates. However, no 
such broadening of the SPR peak was observed in the case of solid Ag/Pd nanoparticles 
prepared via the chemical reduction method [1]. The optical change observed in the present 
study was possibly due to the formation of the hollow nanoparticles, as confirmed by the TEM 
images shown in Fig. 1A. It is noteworthy that the SPR peaks of the Ag45Pd1 nanoparticles 
broadened to a greater extent than those of the Ag90Pd1 nanoparticles. Thus, it would be 
reasonable to state that the concentration of the Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles formed increases with 
the concentration ratio of Pd to Ag.

nanoparticles. 
 
The prepared Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles were tested for their effectiveness as activators for 
ECD. Figure 4A shows the comparative results of EQCM analyses carried out after in situ 
measurements of the catalytic activities, while Fig. 4B shows the open circuit potentials of the 
Ag/Pdhollow, Ag, and Pd nanoparticles, as well as the Pd/Sn colloids in the ECD bath. The 
deposition rates shown in Fig. 4A were recalculated from the changes in the electrode frequency 
using Sauerbrey’s equation [12]. The results of these calculations are summarized in Table 1. Ag 
nanoparticles obtained from the reduction of an 8.197 × 10–3 M solution of Ag ions and Pd 
nanoparticles and Pd/Sn colloids obtained from the reduction of a 1.823 × 10–4 M solution of Pd 
ions were found to be inactive for ECD. The average ECD deposition rates observed during the 
preparation of the hollow Ag90/Pd1 and Ag45/Pd1 nanoparticles were approximately 0.018 
μg/cm2⋅s and 0.04 μg/cm2⋅s, respectively. These values indicate that the Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles 
nanoparticles were icosahedral and decahedral in microstructure and showed better catalytic 
activities for ECD than did Ag nanoparticles, Pd nanoparticles, and Pd/Sn colloids. In addition, the 
catalytic activities of these Ag/Pd nanoparticles in the ECD bath could be controlled by suitably 
tuning their alloy ratios. These Ag/Pdhollow nanoparticles thus constitute a novel class of catalysts 
for ECD.
