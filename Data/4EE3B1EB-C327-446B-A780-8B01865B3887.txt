Formulations 
Consider a composite laminated plate with length a, 
width b, and thickness h as shown in Fig. 1. The 
displacement field may be expressed as 
0 0,( , , ) ( , ) xu x y z u x y zw= −        (1a) 
0 0,( , , ) ( , ) yv x y z v x y zw= −        (1b) 
0( , , ) ( , )w x y z w x y=                      (1c) 
where 0u  and 0v  are the mid-plane in-plane 
displacement components of the plate. 0w  is the 
out-of-plane displacement component of the plate. 
Adopting the Von Karman large deflection assumptions, 
the kinematic relation can be determined as 
{ } { } { } { }0 zε ε κ δ= + +      (2) 
where { }0ε , { }κ , { }δ  are the mid-plane strain, plate 
curvature and large deflection strain, respectively.   
The SMA embedded composite plates are made of 
graphite/epoxy lamina and SMA composite lamina. The 
graphite/epoxy plys are stacked symmetrically on the top 
and bottom of the Nitinol/epoxy ply to make the SMA 
reinforced lamina. Each graphite/epoxy layer has 
arbitrary fiber orientation. The SMA fibers in the middle 
layer are aligned parallel to the y-direction but 
distributed unevenly in the x-direction. Hence, the SMA 
fiber volume fraction, SMAfV , is a function of 
nondimensional coordinate ζ  having its origin at the 
plate center. With this variable SMA fiber spacing, the 
elastic moduli E1, E2, 12ν and G12 for the Nitinol/epoxy 
ply are also the functions of ζ . In this study, the 
formulas used for the calculation of these effective 
engineering constants are based on the rule of mixture

stress in the SMA fiber direction.  
    For a composite laminated plate with N layers, the

expressed as

where Qij  are the transformed reduced stiffness. Now 
the stress-strain relation becomes location-dependent and

For accuracy and simplicity, the three displacement

are assumed to have the same form [5, 13, 14]. By

1.34, 1.22 and 1.11 times of crP
∗ , respectively. Figs. 7 
and 8 show the effect of prestrain and SMA fiber volume 
fraction on postbuckling behavior of [45/-45/0SMA/-45/45] 
laminated plates. As expected, the higher SMA fiber 
volume fraction SMAfV  and prestrain value rε  may 
improve the postbuckling behavior more efficiently. It is 
seen that [45/-45/0SMA/-45/45] plate will buckle into (1,1) 
mode but buckle pattern change may occur if the 
in-plane compressive force is further increased. The 
numbers in parenthesis are the numbers of half-waves in 
the x and y directions. For instance, the plate with SMA 
fiber volume fraction SMAfV  = 20% and prestrain rε  = 
3% is first buckled into (1,1) mode and remains in that 
mode until / crP P
∗  reaches 1.61. When the in-plane 
compressive force is larger than that value, the buckling 
shape of the plate is suddenly shifted from mode (1,1) to 
mode (2,1). 
 
Buckle pattern change 
Fig. 9 identifies the regions that various buckling 
modes of the plate may occur. The buckling load 
0ocrP θ
∗
=  is obtained for the laminated plate without the 
SMA reinforcement and all graphite fibers orientate at 0o. 
The critical buckling load of the plate with larger 
graphite fiber orientation is lower due to its bending 
rigidity is lower. Besides, the buckling mode of the plates 
with graphite fiber orientated between 0o and 32o is 
always mode (1,1). It is seen that buckle pattern change 
occurs for the plates with graphite fiber orientated 
between 33o and 50o. The plate is first buckled into (1,1) 
mode. When the loading is larger than the critical value, 
the buckling shape of the plate is suddenly shifted from 
mode (1,1) to mode (2,1). The buckling mode of the 
plates with graphite fiber orientated between 51o and 63o 
is always mode (2,1). The buckle pattern change also 
occurs for the plates with graphite fiber orientated 
between 64o and 73o. The plate is first buckled into (2,1) 
mode. When the loading is larger than the critical value, 
the buckling shape of the plate is shifted from mode (2,1) 
to mode (3,1). The buckling mode of the plates with 
graphite fiber orientated between 74o and 90o is always 
mode (3,1). The boundary curves between buckling 
modes are plotted for the in-plane compressive force 
does not exceed 3 times of critical buckling load of the 
laminated plate for the specified graphite fiber 
orientation without the SMA reinforcement. The 3-D 
buckling shape plots for the plate with θ  = 45o and 60o 
are shown in Fig. 10 where the development of buckle 
pattern change over the postbuckling region is clearly 
displayed. Once graphite fiber angle is large enough, the 
SMA embedded graphite epoxy laminated plate will have 
lower bending rigidity in the x direction than in the y 
direction. The plate will be first buckled into (n,1) mode 
where n ≥ 1. If the in-plane compressive force is large 
enough, the buckling shape of the plate may suddenly 
shifted from mode (n,1) to mode (n+1,1) or the plate will 
be buckled into (n+1,1) directly. The higher the 
temperature is, the critical buckling load is higher. Hence, 
the curves for high temperature in Fig .9 shift 
horizontally to the right. The similar behaviors may be 
also observed for the plates with higher SMA fiber 
volume fraction or higher prestrain. Besides, the effect of 
the SMA fiber is almost the same in spite of the graphite 
fiber angle (θ ) may vary. In other words, the increases 
for the buckling loads ( PΔ ) of the plates with arbitrary 
graphite fiber angles are almost the same. However, the 
increasing ratio ( P PΔ ) for the plate with larger graphite 
fiber angle is higher than the plate with smaller graphite 
fiber angle. For θ  = 90o and 0 o, the buckling loads at 
100 oC become 1.54 and 1.16 times of the buckling loads 
at 24 oC, respectively. If the stiffness of the laminate 
layer is lower, the influence of the SMA on the buckling 
load of the plate will become more obvious. 
 
SMA fiber distribution function 
 
Due to the necessity of weight saving, the SMA 
may be employed by varying the SMA fiber spacing. The 
SMA fibers may be non-uniformly distributed on the 
composite laminate to more efficiently improve the 
postbuckling performance of the plate. On the other hand, 
the postbuckling deflections of the plate may be 
decreased more for the same amount of SMA fibers. 
Take an example for the average SMA fiber volume 
fraction ( )avSMAfV  = 30%, the SMA fiber volume 
fraction SMAfV  = 60% and 45% at the center (ζ  = 0) of 
Nitinol/epoxy ply for the linear distribution function and 
hybrid (uniform+linear) distribution function, 
respectively. Therefore, the more SMA fibers are 
distributed at the center of the plate. Fig. 11 shows the 
effect of three SMA distributions on postbuckling 
behavior of [45/-45/0SMA/-45/45] laminated plates for 
SMA fiber volume fraction ( )avSMAfV = 30% and 
prestrain rε  = 5%. It is seen that the effect in 
improving the postbuckling behavior is most efficient for 
the linear distribution function. The center of the plate is 
in the region of high curvature and high bending. The 
buckling load may be increased and the postbuckling 
deflections may be decreased by increasing the stiffness 
in the center portion. Therefore, the postbuckling 
behavior may be efficiently improved by increasing the 
SMA fiber volume fraction to reinforce the center of the 
plate. The linear SMA fiber distribution function makes 
the more SMA fibers be concentrated in the center of the 
plate. Hence, the postbuckling behavior may be 
improved most significantly. Fig. 12 shows the effect of 
SMA fiber volume fraction on postbuckling behavior of 
linearly and uniformly distributed SMA reinforced 
composite laminate for prestrain rε  = 5% at 100 oC. 
Only seven curves are plotted due to the SMA fiber 
volume fraction ( SMAfV ) is extremely high at the center 
of Nitinol/epoxy ply for the linear distribution function 
with ( )avSMAfV = 40%. It may be seen that the tendency 
of the curves is the same. The higher SMA fiber volume
