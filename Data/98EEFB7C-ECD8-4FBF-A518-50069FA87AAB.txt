dynamics and cause unstable. Hence, nonlinear
control methods, like fuzzy control [7] and
iterative learning [8], were considered to
enhance the tracking performance.
This project presents a repetitive scheme
with wavelet filtering to design a controller for
a three-phase three-wire shunt APF to improve
these drawbacks. Since the harmonic current
commands in synchronous frame are periodic,
the proposed repetitive control, based on an
internal model principle [9]-[10], is suitable
and can provide exact asymptotic tracking
capability. A standard repetitive controller is
composed of a memory to keep past error
signals and a low-pass filter to ensue stability
and robustness. As the low-pass filter may
introduce phase lag and attenuation in gain, use
of a filter with low bandwidth will achieve
larger robustness but poor tracking
performance. This yields a compromise
between performance and robustness. To
resolve this dilemma, the proposed scheme
employs a delayless low-pass filter realized by
wavelet transform. Therefore, it is expected
that, the proposed controller will achieve better
current tracking performance than conventional
repetitive schemes and ensure precise
compensation of current harmonics.
The effectiveness of the proposed APF will
be verified via computer simulation and
hardware experiment on a 2-kVA prototype,
where the wavelet-based repetitive control
algorithm is realized on a DSP board.

I. Model of the Shunt Active Power Filter
Figure 1 shows a standard six-switch
three-phase shunt active power filter in parallel
with nonlinear load. Under a balanced three
phase ac supply, neglecting the resistance of the
power switches and performing the Park’s
transform [13] on line voltages and currents,
the dynamical model of the shunt APF under
consideration in the rotating d-q frame may be
expressed as

The objective in achieving both harmonic
current compensation and unity power factor
can now be transformed to achieve current
tracking problem. Since in the d-q synchronous
frame, the fundamental components of the
nonlinear load currents appear as DC quantities,
the harmonic currents, *Ldi , due to nonlinear
load may be easily extracted from load current
by just eliminating the DC components as
shown in Fig. 2. To prevent phase shift in
harmonics currents and achieve fast transient
response, a mean value calculator is adopted
instead of low-pass filter. The reactive
reference current command *qi is obtained
from inverting q-axis load current Lqi . On the
other hand, to compensate the converter
switching and conduction losses, a dc
component, *dci , which corresponds to a
current at the fundamental frequency must add
to the d-axis current command. Thus,
concluding the above derivation, the d and q
axis current commads may be written as
*

The current command *dci in eq. (5) is a dc
component that forces the APF to draw a real
II. Experimental Results
A laboratory prototype was built with the
specification list in Table 1. Hardware
configuration in the laboratory experiment is
shown in Fig. 7. The sampling period is 100s.
The dynamical tracking performance of the
proposed control scheme is tested under the
condition that the APF is suddenly turned on at
1 sec. The resulting d and q axis currents are
shown in Fig. 8. The responses of the supply
current and voltage are depicted in Fig. 9. The
responses of the load current and inverter
currents are shown in Fig. 10. The total
harmonic distortion (THD) of the load current
is measured as 29.2%. The measured THD of
the supply current is 4.7 %, which is greatly
improved from that of the load current.
On the other hand, a step change in
nonlinear load from 33 to 16.7, at time
sec8.0t , is also conducted. The responses of
the DC-link voltage, supply voltage and
currents are shown in Fig. 11. It can be
observed that the supply current is almost in
phase with supply voltage. Hence, the power
factor is very close to unity. The harmonic
spectrum of Li and sai are depicted in Fig.
12. From these waveforms, it can be observed
that the proposed scheme exhibits satisfactory
results.
