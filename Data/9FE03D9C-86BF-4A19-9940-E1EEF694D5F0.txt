Introduction 
 
Recently, research on photonic crystals (PhCs) or photonic bandgap (PBG) materials has received 
considerable attention due to the structure-specific periodic dielectric (or refractive index) property of 
these materials. Structural variation of PBG materials can be used to control the propagation of 
electromagnetic (EM) waves in certain frequency ranges [1-4] and the display of the photonic band 
gaps. Certain PBG materials occur naturally as exemplified by some butterfly wings [5-8], arthropod 
cuticles [9], and snake skin [10]; these materials can also be synthetically generated such as in the 
artificial opal crystal. Artificial opal crystals have been extensively utilized in applications including 
paints, bioassays, and photonic paper [11-18]. 
PBG materials can be fabricated by a variety of methods; the simplicity and cost-efficiency of the 
methodology used to fabricate colloid crystals consisting of monodisperse spheres makes these PBGs 
particularly desirable for large-scale production [19]. Colloid crystals are generally fabricated from 
suspensions consisting of inorganic particles or organic polymer spheres, the components of which 
have been widely investigated. Polymer colloids of several hundred nanometers in diameter are 
generally utilized for construction of materials having PBGs in the visible range [20]. Of the numerous 
methods used to synthesize polymer spheres, soap-free emulsion polymerization represents a 
particularly attractive approach due to the high monodispersity and diameter of the generated spheres 
[21]. 
The mechanical properties of opal films are also actively researched because of the potential utility of 
these films in optical devices. The current approaches for fabrication of robust opal films can be 
roughly divided into three categories [22]. The first method, which focuses on improving the 
mechanical properties of the films, involves construction of composite opal films by incorporating the 
ordered particles into polymer materials, such as PDMS [23] and polyacrylate [24]. In the second 
method, inverse opal films are constructed after removal of a colloidal template incorporated into the 
deformable polymer, which is then responsive to slight compressive pressure [25-27]. The third method 
involves the fabrication of functional core-shell spheres. Certain studies [28-30] have indicated that 
hard-core soft-shell structure spheres can be applied to fabricate reversible deformable opal films using 
the melt-flow method; other preparation methods have also been reported [31], including vertical or 
horizontal deposition, which is used to construct elastic opal films by utilizing similar hard-core 
soft-shell particles.  
Generally, core-shell spheres are synthesized by means of layer-by-layer techniques that are 
governed by hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity or interface energies. The stepwise construction of multiple 
layers used in these methods is necessarily time-consuming, and requires complex procedures such as a

amount of particles, volume-averaged diameter, and standard deviation, respectively. 
 
Preparation of Poly(St) /Poly(St-co-BMA) spheres 
Poly(St)/poly(St-co-BMA) spheres were fabricated by introducing the BMA monomer into the reactor 
while the core polymerization was still ongoing. The typical synthesis procedure is as follows: 85 g of 
deionized water, 10 g St, and 490 µl of MAA were combined in a 250 ml three-necked flask. The reaction 
mixture was mechanically stirred at 420 rpm, and the reaction temperature was increased to achieve the 
boiling point. After 5 minutes, 5 g deionized water containing 0.0876 g of dissolved KPS was added to the 
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was polymerized for a specified period of time, after which an 
appropriate amount of BMA monomer was added into the latex mixture. The polymerization was stopped 
after 2 h. 
 
Fabrication of opal films 
The various sphere-suspensions were adjusted to equal solid content using deionized water. 3 μl of 
suspended particles was spread onto a 2 × 2 cm slide glass and dried at various temperatures. The water of 
latex was evaporated, during which the spheres in the latex were self-assembled into the ordered lattice. 
 
 
Results and discussion 
First step: preparation of the monodisperse poly(St) core  
Monodisperse poly(St)/poly(St-co-BMA) structure spheres were fabricated by two-step, soap-free 
emulsion polymerization at the boiling point. Polymerization of the monodisperse poly(St) core spheres was 
allowed to proceed for specified periods of time, after which the BMA monomer was added to prepare the 
core-shell structure microsphere. The relative composition of the poly(St) core portion and the 
 8 
system, and the solid content of the reaction system was controlled at 20%. All of the preparation conditions 
and relative calculation data are summarized in Table 1. The SEM images of the core-shell spheres prepared at 
different degrees of poly(St) conversion are show in Figure 4. The particle sizes fell in the range of 234 ± 13 
nm for all degrees of conversion of poly(St) in the core-shell spheres, consistent with the high monodispersity 
(Cv < 8%). These observations indicated that a high degree of monodispersity of the core-shell sphere could 
be obtained when the second step of monomer addition was performed during the particle growth stage of the 
first step. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, shown in Figure 5, were acquired to further 
investigate the structure of the core-shell spheres. Only one glass transition temperature (Tg = 52.4 °C) was 
observed when the conversion of the core region, i.e., poly(St) in the core-shell sphere, was 20%. However, 
two Tgs were present when the poly(St) conversion increased from 40% to 80% in the core-shell spheres. 
Theoretically, the core-shell sphere is expected to have two Tgs contributed by the poly(St) core and the 
poly(St-co-BMA) shell, respectively. In this case, poly(St-co-BMA) exhibited a lower Tg at about 50 °C and 
poly(St) had a higher Tg at about 105 °C. The ratio between poly(St) and poly(St-co-BMA) in the core-shell 
sphere was determined by the relative conversions of poly(St). A lower proportion of poly(St) resulted in no 
evident Tg for poly(St) in the DSC plot. Increasing the conversion of poly(St) in the core-shell sphere (higher 
than 20%) produced a distinct second Tg peak in the DSC profile, due to the increased proportion of poly(St) 
in the core-shell sphere. Moreover, increasing the poly(St) conversion in the first step resulted in a contrasting 
decrease in the concentration of St in the reaction system. Consequently, at higher poly(St) conversion in the 
first step, there is a lower concentration of St for copolymerization with the BMA monomer, which also 
resulted in the obvious decreasing tendency in Tg (52.4–48.7 °C) of poly(St-co-BMA) shown in Table 1. In 
addition, the Tg of poly(St-co-BMA) was higher than that of poly(BMA) because the unreacted St was still 
present when the monomer was added in the second step. 
 
Preparation of core-shell microsphere with various amounts of monomer addition in second step 
The amount of monomer added in the second step was systematically varied from 6 g to 15 g while the 
poly(St) conversion was fixed at 80% to ensure the core-shell structure of spheres. It was observed that the 
particle size of the core-shell spheres and the thickness of the shell could be increased by increasing the 
monomer concentration. The preparation conditions and relative calculation data are also summarized in Table 
1. SEM analysis (Figure 6) shows the significant observation that the particles had a uniformly spherical 
morphology irrespective of the solid content in the reaction system. By increasing the quantity of BMA 
monomer from 6 g to 15 g, the solid content in reaction system increased from 16% to 25% with an attendant 
increase in the particle size of the core-shell spheres from 224 to 282 nm. This tendency was attributed to the 
increased thickness of poly(St-co-BMA) in the core-shell spheres. DSC analysis (Figure 7) shows the Tg of 
the various core-shell structure spheres prepared by varying the monomer content. It was observed that the Tg 
 10 
to the collapsed structure of the opal film, and cracking of the opal film was due to the quick evaporation of 
solvent during the self-assembly process. Pencil hardness is a generally accepted method for measuring the 
resistance of an opal film. Pencil hardness is determined as the hardest pencil grade that does not mark the 
opal film when pressed firmly against it at 45°; the results of these tests are shown in Table 3. Regardless of 
the self-assembly environment temperature employed, opal films made with poly(St) exhibited less than 
satisfactory mechanical resistance (lower than 6B). In contrast, the opal films consisting of core-shell spheres 
exhibited increasing pencil hardness with increasing self-assembly environment temperature and increasing 
thickness of the poly(St-co-BMA) in the core shell sphere. It was well known that the mobility level of the 
polymer chain on the molecular scale is reflected in the Tg value. The environment temperatures (30, 50, and 
80 °C) employed in the self-assembly process were lower than the Tg of poly(St) (107.7 °C). This means that 
the polymer chains of poly(St) remained in the glassy state, and the poly(St) spheres were simply arranged on 
the surface of the glass slide without any binding interaction between the spheres and the surface. 
Consequently, the poly(St) opal films exhibited unsatisfactory mechanical hardness. Contrastingly, the 
structure of the core shell sphere was designed to enhance the properties of the opal film by combining the 
periodic structure derived from the glassy state of the poly(St) core and the binding force between the spheres 
resulting from the rubbery state of the poly(St-co-BMA) shell. The Tgs of poly(St-co-BMA) in the series of 
core shell spheres were in the range of 42 °C to 57 °C. The mobility of the polymer chain was expected to 
increase with increasing self-assembly environment temperature. Self-assembly of the core shell spheres at 80 
°C produced high mobility of the poly(St-co-BMA) polymer chain, and the soft shell generated a binding 
interaction force between the sphere surfaces. Consequently, HB pencil hardness could be achieved with the 
opal film self-assembled from core shell spheres. 
In order to investigate the surface morphology of the opal film, S10C8B6 was chosen for self-assembly 
at various environmental temperatures; the SEM images are shown in Figure 9. It was difficult to observe the 
deformation of the poly(St-co-BMA) shell for the core shell spheres that were self-assembled below 70 °C. 
When the self-assembly temperature was raised to 80 °C, an indistinct boundary was observed, which could 
be attributed to the deformation of the poly(St-co-BMA) shell at higher temperature. This deformation 
generated a binding force between the surfaces of the spheres, thus making the periodic structure 
self-assembled in air resistant to collapse. 
Finally, the color photograph and reflection spectra of a 2 × 2 cm opal film constructed by using 
S10C8B6 spheres, and dried at 80 °C are shown in Figure 10(a). The opal film exhibited an evident 
bright-green color, and a monopeak at 506 nm could be observed in the reflection spectra (shown in Figure 
10(b)). These results indicated that high quality optical properties of the film could be achieved because of the 
core-shell structure spheres without any deleterious effects to the photonic band gap of the opal film.

1. 學術成就 
本研究提供一種快速且創新的方法，能夠在 2小時內製備具有核殼結構之均一粒徑次微米
球，並且將此方法發表於 Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials，已經於 5
月 10 日刊登電子版。( DOI : 0892705712445940). 
 
2. 技術創新 
一般而言，建構高分子核殼結構次微米球須經過兩個主要的製程，其一為建藉由各種不同
的聚合方式，構核心高分子。而後，高分子核心必須藉由溶脹、表面改質等方式，進一步
包覆殼層高分子。其製程繁瑣且複雜。本研究提供一種簡易的方法，在短時間內即可以合
成各種不同特性之核殼結構球。藉由於核心聚合時添加第二種特性單體的方式，僅只需要
一個製程，即可獲得成品。此方法在簡化製程、縮短反應時間上皆有突破，並且已經申請
中華民國以及美國專利。 
 
3. 社會影響等方面 
本研究提出一種製備核殼結構次微米球的方法，相較於傳統的製備方式，可有效的簡化製
程，且縮短所需要的反應時間，可做為日後工業化應用的參考。此外，亦實際上選擇以硬
核/軟殼之均一粒徑次微米球，進一步成功的提升了光子晶體之成膜性質，可作為相關應
用產業之參考文獻。
