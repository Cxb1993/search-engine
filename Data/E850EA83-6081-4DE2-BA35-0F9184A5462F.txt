systems [4-12]. As well known, the microstrip 
monopole antenna can only radiate the linearly 
polarized (LP) wave with wideband bandwidth. 
Until to now, few studies of the 
circularly-polarized monopole antenna have 
been investigated. The design of the slitted 
ground has been proposed for the band-notch 
function of the UWB monopole antenna [13]. By 
simply embedding a small rectangular slit in the 
ground plane, a notched band can be achieved.  
In the past, we have proposed a microstrip 
monopole antenna with circular polarization and 
linear polarization by combining the monopole 
antenna and the inverted-L strip [14]. The CP 
radiation wave at 1.575 GHz is excited by the 
loop mode and the LP radiation wave at 1.8 GHz 
is excited by the monopole mode. However, the 
CP performance is not easy to achieve by tuning 
the geometrical parameters of the antenna.    
In this project, we present a microstrip-fed 
circularly-polarized loop-like antenna which 
meets the requirements of both a digital 
communication system and a global positioning 
system. Based on the studies in [14], by utilizing 
the coupling effect between the monopole 
antenna and sleeve, the excited resonant mode 
can be changed to the loop mode, a 
traveling-wave mode. The phase difference of 90 
degree for the orthogonal electric fields is 
derived by embedding the slit in the ground 
plane and the CP radiation can be easily 
achieved. The measured and simulated results of 
S11 and AR agree well. The design procedures 
are presented. 
 
2. ANTENNA DESIGN 
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of 
the proposed CP GPS/DCS antenna. The 
proposed antenna configuration consists of a 
C-like monopole, one sleeve and one slit. The 
antenna is printed on an FR4 microwave 
substrate with thickness of 1.6 mm and relatively 
permittivity of 4.4. A 50-Ω microstrip-fed line 
with a width (Wt = 3 mm) is used to excite the 
antenna. An impedance transformer is inserted 
between the monopole antenna and the feeding 
line. Impedance matching is also optimized by 
cutting the copper ground plane. The C-like 
monopole is centrally placed at the end of the 
microstrip feeding line and the length of the 
monopole antenna is determined by a quarter 
wavelength at 2 GHz. Due to the interaction 
between the monopole and the ground plane, the 
length will decrease. Because of the bent 
structure, the impedance matching condition is 
poor. As similar as the design of adding a 
shorted parasitic wire [15], we add an inverted-L 
strip on the right side of the ground plane in 
order to improve the impedance characteristics. 
At the GPS band, the monopole and the 
inverted-L sleeve can be treated as the rhombic 
hula hoop [16], and the proposed antenna can 
have the current distribution of traveling-wave 
type on the loop, which has approximately a 
constant amplitude and linearly changing phase. 
The current distribution is changed by modifying 
the geometrical dimensions of the gap between 
the monopole and sleeve. To improve the phase 
difference of the two orthogonal electric fields 
and achieve the better circular polarization, an 
L-shaped slit is embedded in the ground plane 
on the left side of the feeding line. The slit width 
(S) is 1 mm. By tuning the geometrical 
parameters of the antenna, the characteristic 
parameters such as reflection coefficient (S11) 
and axial ratio (AR) of the proposed antenna 
 4
magnitude of the co-polarized patterns. The 
simulated gain and efficiency of the proposed 
antenna is shown in Fig. 7. The gains are about 
1.95 and 1.15 dBi at 1.57 and 1.80 GHz. The 
efficiencies are larger than 80 % over the 
operated band.  
The distribution of the simulated surface 
current density of the antenna is shown in Fig. 8. 
From the results, due to the slit embedding in the 
ground plane, the induced current distributes 
along the slit and is helpful for the CP radiation, 
as expected. The distribution shows that the 
proposed antenna is excited by the loop mode, a 
travelling-wave mode, at 1.575 and 1.8 GHz. 
According the traveling direction of the 
simulated surface current, the type of the circular 
polarization of the proposed antenna is left-hand. 
However, the right-hand circular polarization 
can be derived by moving the sleeve to the left 
side of the ground plane and reversing the C-like 
antenna and the sleeve.
